[{"bibliography":"Travis Norsen, T., 2017, Foundations of Quantum Mechanics: An\n Exploration of the Physical Meaning of Quantum Theory, Cham: Springer.\n \n This is a textbook for students who\n want to learn quantum mechanics, but learn it in a way that emphasizes\n physical clarity. The book covers topics of a standard introduction\n to quantum physics, but focuses attention on questions of ontology\n often glossed over in standard texts. The physics student who wants to\n learn quantum mechanics either as preparation for studying foundations\n or simply in a way that looks for clear answers to questions like ‘What\n are the basic objects in the quantum world?’, ‘What kinds of\n configurations can they assume?’, ‘How do they move and interact with one\n another?’ can do no better than starting here.\n \n "},{"bibliography":" Susskind, L. and Friedman, A., 2014,  Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum (2nd edition), New York: Basic Books.\n \n At 384 pages, this book isn’t as pithy as the\n title would suggest. It provides very clear presentation of the\n principles of quantum mechanics for the physics student without\n any previous background. This is how one would learn quantum\n mechanics in a standard university course.\n \n "},{"bibliography":"Ballentine, L., 1998, Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Approach,\nSingapore: World Scientific Publishing Company.\n \nThis book is not recommended for beginners, and not\nrecommended as a textbook.

Dalibard, 2005, Quantum Mechanics,\nBerlin: Springer.\n \n This is a brief, but elegant introduction. There aren’t a\ngreat many problems, but detailed solutions are provided for those that\nare included. The book comes with a CD-ROM that is very helpful\nfor visualization.\n \n"},{"bibliography":"Dirac, P.A.M., 1930 [1958], The Principles of Quantum\nMechanics, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1930; 4th edition, revised,\n1958.\n \n This is a classic, beautiful book that remains one of the clearest\npresentations of quantum mechanics. Everything is presented with\nextreme simplicity using Dirac’s formulation with non-commutative\nalgebra. Even a beginner will be able to follow the presentation. The\nbook emphasizes logical structure, in Dirac’s words: “problems were\ntackled top-down, by working on the great principles, with the details\nleft to look after themselves.”\n"},{"bibliography":"Cohen-Tannoudji, C., 2006, Quantum Mechanics,\nNew York: Wiley-Interscience.\n\n \n This is a comprehensive, encyclopedic text.

It is concise and very easy to read. There is an emphasis\non conceptual development. Unfortunately, there are no worked examples\nin the book, and the answers to the problems are available only to\ninstructors. It is easy to find and has recently been updated.\n \n"},{"bibliography":"Liboff, R., 1998, Introductory Quantum Mechanics (4th edition),\nSan Francisco: Addison-Wesley.\n\n \n This is a nicely designed book, relatively\nwell-written.

It is\nwell-written and there is emphasis on experimental phenomena and\nimportant questions like Bell’s Inequality. The material is introduced\nat a higher level than Griffiths and Shankar, with lots of\nmathematics. There is a wealth of problems, but unfortunately few\nsolutions are provided, making it most useful in a classroom setting\nor in conjunction with a book that contains worked examples and\nderivations.\n \n"},{"bibliography":"Schwinger, J., 2003, Quantum Mechanics (corrected\nedition), Berlin: Springer.\n\n \n This book is extremely mathematical in\nemphasis. There is less emphasis on conceptual development, and it is\nbest used after one has acquired a conceptual understanding of QM and\nwants to see the mathematical development. The approach is very\nrevealing. It is a difficult text, in part because some of the\nformalism is abstract and unconventional, but it is well worth the\neffort to comprehend. The problems throughout are excellent, but again\nunfortunately, solutions are not included in the text.\n \n"},{"bibliography":"Shankar, R., 1994, Principles of Quantum Mechanics\n(2nd edition), Berlin: Springer.\n\n \n This book is highly recommended as a starting\npoint. It starts from ground zero, developing the mathematical tools\nneeded to understand quantum mechanics. It is well written, and\nfriendlier than Griffiths for students who are learning the subject on\ntheir own. QM is not introduced until page 115.  The\nintroductory chapter on linear algebra is very good. At 676 pages, it\nis comprehensive. It covers Feynman path integrals more thoroughly\nthan other books, and contains solved problems. If you buy one book on\nQM, this is a good choice.\n \n"},{"bibliography":"Zettili, N., 2009, Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications,\nChichester: John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\n \n This is a very good book as well.
