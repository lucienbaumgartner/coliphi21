The source of mysticism and the mystical\nelements in Islam are to be traced to the Qur’an and the Islamic\ndoctrine itself. Some of the Qur’anic verses have been viewed by\nthe mystics and philosopher-mystics of Islam as allegorical and\nesoteric hints for those who can see them. “God is the Outward\nand the Inward” (Qu’ran 57:3), “he for whom wisdom\nis given, he truly has received abundant good” (Qu’ran\n2:269), and the famous light verses\n\n\nGod is the Light of the heavens and the earth, the likeness of His\nlight is as a niche wherein is a lamp, the lamp is a glass, the glass\nas it were a glittering star kindled from a blessed tree, an olive\nthat is neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil well-night\nwould shine, even if no fire touched it; light upon lights; God guides\nto His light whom He will. And God strikes similitudes for man, and\nGod has knowledge of everything. (Qu’ran 24:35)\n\n\n\ncan all be seen as containing esoteric insight. Through out the ages,\nthese verses have inspired a number of Muslim gnostics, some of whom,\nsuch as Shihāb al-Dīn Suhrawardī (12th CE)\nand Mullā Ṣadrā (16th CE) have written\ncommentaries upon them (e.g., Mullā Ṣadrā’s\nOn the Hermeneutics of the Light Verse of the Quran).\n\n\nFrom a mystical perspective, all later developments and interactions\nbetween Islamic philosophy and other intellectual traditions should\ntherefore be seen as rational expressions of the mystical elements\nwithin an Islamic milieu. Mystical elements exist in Islam in two\ndifferent and independent ways. Practically, Sufism represents the\nesoteric dimension of Islam in its purest form, while theoretically\nsalient features of Islamic mysticism were gradually incorporated into\nthe Islamic philosophical tradition. Islamic mysticism, therefore,\nstands on two pillars: first practical, then philosophical. That is,\nesoteric wisdom can either be attained through practical wisdom, which\nincludes inner purification and asceticism, or through a type of\nphilosophy which includes, but is not limited to discursive\nreasoning.\n\nFollowing the early theological schools of thought in Islam, among\nwhich were the determinists (Qadarites), the eschatologists\n(Murj‘aites and Wa‘idites) and the faith\nbased theologians (Ash‘arites), there came the Islamic\nphilosophical tradition and its many different schools of thought.\nEven though Al-Kindī is regarded to be the first Muslim\nphilosopher, the full impact of Hellenic thought on Islamic philosophy\nis best seen in the philosophical edifice of Abū Nasr\nFārābī (10th CE) Al-Fārābī,\nwho is considered to be the father of logic in the Islamic\nphilosophical tradition, is also the first to have embraced\nNeoplatonism, albeit in a limited sense. It was his paradigm that\npaved the way for mysticism to enter Islamic philosophy. \nNeoplatonism, which has remained one of the salient features of\nIslamic philosophy, has performed two functions: the intellectual and\nthe practical, both of which have become an integral part of living a\nphilosophical life. Philosophically, Neoplatonism provides answers to\nmost major questions within the context of Islam, such as how\nmultiplicity came from unity and how corporality emanated from an\nincorporeal God, as well as explaining the ascending and descending\norder of beings. \nMysticism in Al-Fārābī manifests itself in two ways,\nphilosophical and practical. Philosophically, as is evident in The\nLetter Concerning the Intellect (Risālah\nfi’l-‘aql), his interpretation of the concept of the\nfour intellects paved the road for his successor Avicenna (Ibn\nSīnā) (981–1037 CE), who made full use of\nNeoplatonism. Al-Fārābī tries in his writings not only\nto reconcile the opinions of Plato and Aristotle, with Plato seen as\nsomewhat of a mystical figure, but also, in his discussions of\npolitical philosophy, he replaced Plato’s philosopher-king with\nan Imam whose understanding of truth is intuitive, who knows not only\ntheoretical virtues but also the practical ones. However, even though\nhis musical compositions are sung among some Sufi orders in Turkey and\nthe Indo-Pakistani continent and one can see the influence of Sufism\nin his Bezels of Wisdom (Fuṣūṣ\nal-ḥikam), reports concerning him having been a practicing\nSufi are quite nebulous. \nAs to the master of the Peripatetics, Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā)\nhimself, the consensus of scholars is that Avicenna was a rationalist\nwho embraced certain concepts from Plato, Aristotle and Neoplatonism\nand that the salient feature of his philosophical writings are\ndiscursive in nature. From here on, there are generally two distinct\ninterpretations of Avicennan philosophy: Those who see him only as a\nrationalist who had nothing to do with mysticism and those who argue\nthat later Avicenna had embraced mysticism as is reflected in some of\nhis later works. \nMost Western scholars of Avicenna who see him only as a rationalist,\nsimilar to al-Fārābī and Averroes, (Gutas 2006, Adamson\n2013) primarily rely on his discursive and rationalistic writings.\nMany Muslim philosophers in particular Iranian scholars of Avicenna\nhave a more inclusive reading of his writings and tend to agree that\nin the later period of his life, Avicenna developed an interest in\nmysticism. (Nasr & Leaman 1996, Inati 1996). \nFor Avicenna, similar to many other Muslim philosophers, the ultimate\nphilosophical endeavor was to unveil the mystery of creation in\nparticular; how Divine unity became the multiplicity of the world of\nexistents. To resolve this riddle, Avicenna adopts the Neoplatonic\nscheme of emanation which has also been used not only by Sufis and\nIslamic gnostics to explain the spiritual journey of man towards God\nbut also, by almost all philosopher-mystics from Suhrawardī and\nMullā Ṣadrā to Sabziwārī and\nṬabāṭabā’ī. \nAvicenna was not a practicing Sufi with any known affiliation to a\nSufi order. In fact, Avicenna’s meeting with the great Sufi\nmaster Abū Sa‘īd Abu’l-Khayr (d. 1049 CE) and\nthe presence of an “oriental philosophy”\n(al-ḥikmat al-mashraqiyyah) in his writing in all\nlikelihood are apocryphal. However, the presence of mystical elements\nin some of his later works is held by some to be undeniable\n(Aminrazavi 2003). For instance, in the ninth chapter of his\nphilosophical masterpiece Remarks and Treatments\n(al-Ishārāt wa’l-tanbihāt), in a section\nentitled On the Stations of Knowers (Fī maqāmāt\nal-‘ārifīn), Avicenna appears to offers an\nexplanation of the Sufi doctrine and openly to defend the gnostic and\nSufi method of attaining truth. While the authorship of some of his\nPersian writings are subject to debate, in some of his allegorical\nwritings, such as Treatise on Ascendance (Mi‘rāj\nnāmah), Treatise on Birds (Risālat al-ṭaīr),\nSalmān and Absāl, Son of the Living Awake (Ḥayy\nibn Yaqẓān) and Treatise on Love (Risālah\nfi’l-‘ishq) not to mention his famous poem Ode of\nthe Soul (al-Qaṣidah al-‘ayniyyah), the presence of\nSufi and gnostic elements are vividly apparent to those who follow\nthis interpretation. \nWith Avicenna, who represents the pinnacle of rationalistic philosophy\nin Persia, came two other intellectual trends. On the one side there\nwas the towering figure of Abū Ḥāmid\nGhazzālī, who rejected philosophy altogether and became the\nexponent of Sufism alone. On the other side, there arose\nIsmā‘īlīs philosophy, which incorporated Sufi and\nHermetico-Pythagorean ideas within a philosophical context. \nGhazzālī, an orthodox jurist and a major exponent of faith\nbased theology (Ash‘arite) having studied philosophy,\nthought discursive reasoning stood on a solid ground but soon turned\nagainst philosophy, offering a devastating critique of reason in his\nThe Incoherence of Philosophers (Tahāfut\nal-falāsifah). Having been disillusioned with intellectual\nsciences, he practiced asceticism for a number of years in seclusion\nand finally found his answers in the Sufi tradition. The spiritual\njourney of Ghazzālī from an orthodox jurist to a Sufi is one\nof the most remarkable accounts of the transformation of a Muslim sage\nwho turned from the outward to the inner life of Islam and found\nSufism to be the only path that leads to truth. He spent the later\npart of his life teaching, writing and practicing Sufism. \nGhazzālī is one of the few mystics whose brand of Sufism\nembraces religious orthodoxy, a gnostic intellectual framework, and\nthe more practical and ascetic dimension of the spiritual path.\nContrary to the antinomian Sufis, who violated the Islamic law\n(Shari‘ah) and the more relaxed attitude of some of the\nother Sufis, Ghazzālī was an austere and ardent observer of\nIslamic law. \nHe wrote extensively on mysticism, arguing it to be the only right\npath to truth. A notable piece among his writings on mysticism is\nThe Niche of Light (Mishkāt al-anwār), a\nsignificant work of an illuminationist nature and one that influenced\nthe formation of the doctrine of illumination (ishrāq)\nby Suhrawardī (Aminrazavi 1996). Also, parts of his Magnum Opus,\nRevival of Religious Sciences (Iḥyā’\nal-‘ulūm al-dīnī), such as book thirty-five\nof the Iḥyā’: The Book of Faith in Divine Unity\nand Trust in Divine Providence, are essentially devoted to an\nexplication of the Sufi doctrine. He also has written numerous shorter\ncommentaries on the spiritual significance of fasting, praying,\ninvocation of divine names and attributes, and spiritual music as\ninstruments of the catharsis of the soul. \nOn the Ismā‘īlīs side, the use of the esoteric\ndoctrine of Hermeticism and the Greco-Alexandrian mystical teachings\nwere adopted by Ismā‘īlīs philosophers. Such\nconcepts as emanation from the One, asceticism, the body as prison\nwith the soul as its inmate, initiation into the mysteries of gnosis\n(ma‘rifah), levels of interpretations of spiritual\nhermeneutics (ta’wīl), sacred geometry with its\nmystical symbolism, cycles of prophecy, and the initiatic role of\nShi‘ite Imams are among many of the mystical themes of\nIsmā‘īlī philosophical tradition. Among the most\nnotable Ismā‘īlī figures in the 10th\nand 11th century CE is Jabir Ibn Ḥayyān, (c.\n721–c. 815 CE) who was more of a scientist and chemist and as\nsuch offered in his The Book of Stones (Kitāb\nal-aḥjār) a mystical interpretation of the science of\nletters and the esoteric mathematical concepts that are influenced by\nPythagorean geometry. It should be noted that he was a figure under\nwhose name works by many diverse thinkers may have been collected.\nAbū Ya‘qub Sijistānī was also a notable figure in\nthe movement whose mystical writings in Unveiling of the\nHidden (Kashf al-maḥjūb) and The Book of\nWell Springs (Kitāb al-yanābi‘) provide an\nesoteric commentary on major philosophical and religious matters (see\nNasr & Aminrazavi 1999/2001). Sijistānī, whose writings\nshould be regarded as a spiritual commentary on the gnostic doctrine\npertaining to the flight of the soul toward its paradisal state,\ncenters on the oneness of God, the intellects both Divine and human,\nand different types of souls together with their relationship with the\nbody. In the above mentioned works, Sijistānī systematically\ntreats notions of creation, the role of prophets as spiritual guides,\nand the hidden symbolism of their teachings. As one goes from the\noutward to the inward and esoteric level of Islam, one gains the\nconsciousness which is the key to understanding the symbolism of\nprophetic teachings. Among other major figures and esoteric mystical\ntexts in this vein is Abū Ḥātim Rāzī’s\n(811–891 CE) Science of Prophecy (A‘lām\nal-nubuwwah), in which he applies the concept of emanation to the\ncosmological notion of Be (kun) and offers a\nmystical commentary on how human soul is a trace of the higher soul\nthat is perfect. \nAlso, one must mention Ḥamīd al-Dīn Kirmānī\n(d. 996–1021 CE) and his numerous writings on Sufism and\ngnosticism, the most notable of which is his Repose of the\nIntellect (Rāḥat al-‘aql). A prominent\nIsmā‘īlī philosopher, considered by some as the\n“Ismā‘īlīs’ Ibn\nSīnā,” he argued that an understanding of truth is\nbased on two precepts. First, one has to live a morally virtuous life\nand second, the adept must prepare himself philosophically. The\nchapters of Rāḥat al-‘aql\nare called aswar (walls) and the paragraphs,\nmashāri‘ (paths). The novice has\nto travel through fifty-six paths within seven walls in order for the\nsoul to gain the knowledge of Reality. Reality, according to\nKirmānī, is divided into four different levels: first is the\nworld of Divine creation or the incorporeal world\n(‘alām\nal-ibdā‘), second, the corporeal\nrealm (‘ālam al-jism), third,\nthe domain of religion (‘alām\nal-dīn), and finally, the return of the\nworld to its original unity with God (Baumstark 1932; Corbin 1961;\nCorbin 1964, 130–1; Hunzai 1986). \nPerhaps the most important figure of the\nIsmā‘īlīs tradition, one who was both poet and\nphilosopher, is Nāṣir-i Khusraw (1004–c.1072 CE).\nWhether in his collection of mystical and didactic poems known as\nDivān, or his mystically oriental works such as The\nSum of the Two Wisdoms (Jāmi‘\nal-ḥikmattayīn) and Knowledge and Liberation\n(Gushāyesh wa rahāyesh), he relentlessly offers\nadvice on the catharsis of the soul and the pursuing of the spiritual\njourney. Nāṣir-i Khusraw’s attempt to reconcile\nSufism and reason is seen in his The Sum of the Two Wisdoms,\nwhere he argues that the “sages of real religion”\n(ḥukamāy-i dīn-i ḥaqq) and the\nphilosophers are in agreement. For Nāṣir-i Khusraw, the\nscience of the soul is the way to attain real knowledge, knowledge\nwhich transcends the difference between the perceiver and perception.\nHe writes: \nNāṣir-i Khusraw offers specific instructions how a novice\nshould follow the spiritual path, relying on specific ascetic\npractices. Similar to the figures of St. Augustine and St. Francis of\nAssisi, Nāṣir-i Khusraw pursued a hedonistic lifestyle in\nthe early part of his life but underwent a spiritual metamorphosis and\ndedicated himself to the Sufi path. Echoes from both phases of his\nlife can be seen through out his works (Hunsburger 2000). \nThere are also several encyclopedic works of the\nIsmā‘īlī tradition whose authors are unknown.\nMany of these deal with mystical and Sufi ideas. Among the works that\nhave been influential in the spread of gnostic ideas are treatises\nlike Brethren of Purity (Ikhwān\nal-ṣafā) and The Mother of Books (Umm\nal-kitāb) (Daftary 1990; Nasr & Aminrazavi\n1999/2001). \nTraditionally, historians of philosophy have argued that after\nGhazzālī in the 11th century CE, philosophical\nactivity in the Persian and Eastern part of the Islamic world was\neclipsed and shifted to Islamic Spain. There are those who attribute\nthis to Ghazzālī’s scathing attack on the\nphilosophers, but this is mostly a myth. The Islamic world at the time\nwas so large, and the intellectual milieu so rich and diverse, that no\nsingle book could put an end to its philosophy and discursive\nreasoning. While it is true that Peripatetic philosophy suffered a\ntemporary eclipse in Persia, the reason lies in the socio-political\nrealities of the Saljūq dynasty and the Islamic world’s\nstruggle with external forces like the Crusades. Recent\nscholarship, such as that by Qasim Kaka'i in\nthe Journal of Andishah-yi Dini, has revealed that\nthe so called period of philosophical decline was actually a\nthriving era of intellectual activity in the Southern part of Persia\nwhere the so called the “School of Shiraz” emerged. This\nSchool whose salient feature was to synthesis rationalism, mysticism,\nintellectual intuition and even popular Sufism was undoubtedly the\nprecursor to the School of Isfahan.  \nAmong the great masters of philosophical mysticism hailing from Spain,\nIbn Masarrah (883–931 CE) stands out. He was an ascetic whose\nviews on the mystic quest for unity of the soul with God comprised a\nmajor theme in his philosophical mysticism. Others include Ibn\nḤazm (994–1064), who emphasized mystical love,\nIbn-Bājjah (1095–1138 CE) who treated the concept of\nintellectual and mystical intuition as the faculty that experiences\nDivine realities, Ibn Al-Sid of Badajoz (1052–1127 CE) who\ndeveloped what some have called mathematical mysticism, and\nIbn-Ṭufayl (c. 1105–1185 CE), whose mystical allegory\nSon of the Living Awake (Ḥayy ibn Yaqẓān)\nand his concept of Active Intellect, made him a major exponent of\nmysticism in the Islamic philosophical tradition. Finally there is the\nSufi philosopher, Ibn Sab‘īn (1217–1268 CE) who made\nan effort to bring about a rapprochement between philosophy and Sufism\nin a systematic treatment of mystical themes. \nDespite the significance of the above figures, none of them reached\nthe eminence of the greatest master of gnostic and philosophical\nSufism, Shaykh Muḥyī al-Dīn Ibn ‘Arabī\n(1165–1240 CE) often referred to Shaykh al-Akbar (The Great\nMaster). Ibn ‘Arabī, whose encyclopedic works, The\nBezels of Wisdom (Fuṣūṣ al-ḥakam)\nand Meccean Victories (Futuḥāt\nal-Makkiyah), provide us with one of the most complex mystical\nparadigms in the Islamic mystical genre. Often referred to as the\n“Doctrine of the Unity of Being” (wahdat\nal-wūjūd), Ibn ‘Arabī’s philosophical\nmysticism offers a vast synthesis of gnostic and Sufi ideas as well as\na type of philosophical discourse which, for the first time,\nformulates the Sufi doctrine. With Ibn ‘Arabī, we see a\nmonumental effort to comment on a full array of metaphysical,\ncosmological, and psychological aspects of Gnosticism, thereby\nproviding a vision of reality whose attainment requires the practice\nof the Sufi path. Ibn ‘Arabī’s philosophico-mystical\nedifice is a process of spiritual hermeneutics\n(ta’wīl) which relies on the language of symbolism\nto guide a novice from the exterior (ẓāhir) to the\ninterior (bāṭin). For Ibn ‘Arabī, the\nentire cosmos represents signs (ayāt) which lend\nthemselves to symbolic exegesis, a process whose pinnacle is the\nUniversal Man (al-insān al-kāmil). Ibn\n‘Arabī, whose doctrine of the Unity of Being\n(waḥdat al-wūjūd) has been interpreted by\nmany to be pantheism, was nevertheless careful to argue that even\nthough God dwells in things, but the world “is not” in\nGod. For Ibn ‘Arabī, humans are microcosms and the universe\nis the macrocosm; the Universal Man is the one who realizes all of his\ninherent potentialities, including the Divine breath which was blown\ninto man by God in the beginning of creation as the Qur’an says.\nFor Ibn ‘Arabī, it is the spiritual realization of God\nwithin the soul that leads to union with God (see Nasr 1964; Chittick\n1989 and 2007). \nIn the 12th century CE, during the so called “period\nof decline” of philosophical activities, the most notable figure\nwas the philosopher-mystic, Shaykh Shihāb al-Dīn\nSuhrawardī, the founder of the School of Illumination\n(Ishrāq). Suhrawardī, who was a Peripatetic, wrote\nfour major works, primarily in the Aristotelian tradition. He also\nwrote a number of works in a peculiar esoteric tradition, using what\nhe called “the language of illumination” (lisān\nal-ishrāq). In his illuminationist writings, Suhrawardī\nrelies on Neoplatonism but replaces such concepts as being and\nexistence with light and illumination, thus offering what can be\ncalled a gnostic-illuminationist version of Avicennian philosophy\n(Aminrazavi 2003). He offers his doctrine of illumination in his major\nwork, The Philosophy of Illumination (Ḥikmat\nal-ishrāq). \nIn his Sufi writings, Suhrawardī employs both allegory and\ndidactic language to advise the novice how to follow the Sufi path,\noften with specific instructions regarding ascetic practices.\nPractical wisdom constitutes an inseparable component of the\nishrāqī doctrine, so much so that in the\nintroduction to his magnum opus, The Philosophy of\nIllumination, Suhrawardī warns the reader that the secrets\nof the book will remain hidden to the reader unless he fasts for forty\ndays and avoids consuming meat. Suhrawardī, similar to Ibn\n‘Arabī, uses symbolism from nature and animals to offer a\nspiritual hermeneutic (ta’wīl) which begins with\ndiscursive philosophy but ends in gnosis and the spiritual return of\nman to his original abode. \nSuhrawardī is also credited with having advocated an\nepistemological theory known as “knowledge by presence”\n(‘ilm al-ḥuḍurī), in which knowledge\nis attained directly and experientially when the knower, known, and\nthe epistemic relation become one and the same (Yazdi 1992).\nSuhrawardī’s works on Sufism, most of which are written in\nPersian, include The Red Intellect (‘Aql-i\nsurkh), The Chant of Gabriel’s Wing\n(Āwaz-i par-i Jibrā’īl), Story of\nthe Occidental Exile (Qiṣṣat al-ghurbat\nal-gharbiyyah), Language of the Termites (Lughat-i\nmurān), Treatise on the State of Childhood\n(Risālah fi ḥālat al-ṭufuliyyah), A\nDay Among the Sufis (Ruzī bā jamā‘at-i\nṣufiyān), The Sound of the Griffin\n(Safir-i simurg), Treatise of the Nocturnal Ascent\n(Risālah fi’l-mi‘rāj), and Treatise\nof Illumination (Partaw-nāmah) (Aminrazavi 1994). \nSuhrawardī’s illuminationist philosophy has influenced many\nphilosophers who wrote major commentaries on gnostic and Sufi texts,\namong whom are Qutb al-Dīn Shirāzī (1236–1311\nCE), Muḥammad Shahrazurī (d. 1153 CE), and Ibn Turkah\nIṣfahānī (c. 1362–1433 CE) Following\nSuhrawardī there is an even closer nexus between philosophy and\nmysticism. A number of rationalistic philosophers who adhered to Sufi\nideas and often practiced Sufism, became exponents of philosophical\nmysticism. The post Suhrawardīan philosopher-mystics, who\ncontinued to refine the rapprochement between philosophy and\nmysticism, have come to be known as the “School of\nShirāz.” \nRecent scholarship, such as that by Qasim Kaka'i in\nthe Journal of Andishah-yi Dini, has revealed that\nwhat has traditionally been regarded as the period of decline of\nphilosophical activities in Persia was, after all, a very thriving\nperiod in philosophical activities in the Southern part of Persia.\nBetween 11th–16th century, Shiraz became\nthe center of Sufi and gnostic thought in Persia. Beginning with\nQuṭb al-Dīn Shirāzī, who wrote a major commentary\non Suhrawardī’s Philosophy of Illumination in\nattempt to clarify Suhrawardī’s illuminative thought, the\nSchool of Shiraz produced a number of philosopher-Sufis. Quṭb\nal-Din Shirāzī’s successor, Mīr Ṣadr\nal-Dīn Dashtakī (1424 CE) dealt with the problem of\nexistence and the question of its principality. Jalāl al-Dīn\nDawānī (1427 CE), another philosopher of this tradition,\nwrote on the exoteric subjects like law as well as esoteric matters.\nHis work on the relationship between Sufism, ethics, and\nilluminationist thought entitled Sparks of Illumination in the\nVirtues of Ethics (Lawāmi‘ al-ishrāq fī\nmakārim al-akhlāq), also knows as Jalalian Ethics\n(Akhlāq-ī Jalālī ) is of particular\nimportance. This work is still used today by Sufi masters as a\npractical guide on how spiritual ethics can cleanse the soul.\nDawānī also wrote a number of commentaries on\nSuhrawardī’s philosophy of illumination, such as Forms\nof Brightness Concerning the Temples of Light (Shawākil\nal-ḥur fī sharḥ hayākil al-nūr). The\nnext philosopher-mystic belonging to the School of Shirāz is\nGhiyāth al-Dīn Manṣur Dashtakī (b.1461), the\noldest son of Ṣadr al-Dīn Dashtakī and the greatest\ngnostic philosopher of this period. Called a “one man\nuniversity,” he was well versed in law and jurisprudence as well\nas theoretical Sufism. Notable among his many works is his\nStations of Wisdom (Maqāmāt\nal-‘ārifīn), a profoundly gnostic work which came\nto symbolize the spirit of the School of Shirāz. Dashtakī\nhere presents a rich esoteric commentary on the verses of the\nQur’an, the ḥadith and the sayings of such Sufi masters as\nḤallāj (858–922 CE), Rūmī (1207–1273\nCE), and Ḥāfiz (1320–1388 CE) among others, providing\nthe reader with an understanding of how the love of God can lead to\nthe transcendental unity of being. The influence of Ibn\n‘Arabī is quite evident in this piece. Once again\nrapprochement between peripatetic philosophy,\nishrāqī doctrine, theology, and gnosticism\n(‘irfān) is made in order to help the seeker of\ntruth find his path through the maze of spiritual pitfalls. \nAmong other philosophers of this period not necessarily affiliated\nwith the School of Shirāz, but interested in Sufism, are\nNaṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī (1201–1274)\nwho wrote a work on Sufi ethics entitled Description of\nNobles (Awṣāf al-ashrāf), as well as\nAfd’al al-Dīn Kāshānī (d. 1213), a Sufi poet\nand philosopher. The latter was a strict Aristotelian who wrote\nextensive commentary on logic and other aspects of Aristotelian\nthought. While the majority of his fifty-two works are philosophical\nin nature, Kāshānī sees the task of philosophy to be\nthe facilitation of “following the path of God,” as the\ntitle of one of his works suggests. His commentary on Ibn\n‘Arabī, his references to other gnostics and Sufis, and his\nmystical poetry, have identified him more as a Sufi than a\nrationalistic philosopher. Writing quatrains in the style of Omar\nKhayyam (1048–1131), it is in his poetry that Sufism is most\napparent. In a quatrain he says, \nMoving from Persia to India, in the 11th century CE., when\nthe Persian dynasty of Ghaznavids began to rule in India,\nphilosophical mysticism and the practice of Sufism became popular\namong the Indian Muslim philosophers. Among the central figures of\nthis movement are Shaykh Yousef Gardiī Multānī, Shaykh\nIsmā‘īl Lahorī, Imām Ḥasan\nSan‘ānī, and Shaykh Abu’l-Ḥasan\n‘Alī Hujwaīrī, the philosopher-Sufi and the\nauthor of Unveiling of the Veiled (Kashf\nal-maḥjūb). At that time, the\nIsmā‘īlī missionaries, who had spread the gnostic\ninterpretation of Islam in India had already created a receptive\nintellectual milieu for the Sufi and gnostic ideas. By the\n14th century CE., due to the migration of Persian\nphilosophers and their students to northern India, the more mystically\noriented philosophy of the above figures gained popularity in India as\nwell. \nWithin the next two centuries, despite the rise and fall of several\ndynasties, the patronage of philosophers in India in general did not\nchange. Sufi patronage reached a new high during the Mongol period,\nwhose rulers were particularly keen in the Sufi tradition in all its\nmanifestations; especially philosophy, poetry and the visual arts.\nSuch notable Persian philosophers as Taftazānī (c.\n1322–1390 CE) and Jurjānī (1097–1127 CE) went to\nIndia at this time. They were followed by such figures as Mīr\nFatḥ Allāh Shirāzī, who reformed the educational\ncurriculums to emphasize the teachings of the mystical philosophies of\nhis Persian teachers. \nPhilosophical mysticism continued in the Islamic philosophical\ntradition of northern India in figures such as Khāwjah\nMuḥammad Baqī bi’llāh (b.1563), a celebrated\nmystic and the founder of Naqshbandī Sufi order, as well as in\nhis student Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindī (1564–1624), the\nproponent of the doctrine of “The Unity of Consciousness”\n(waḥdat al-shuhūd) and the author of\nEpistoles (Maktubāt). Other Muslim philosophers\nfrom the Indo-Pakistani continent who incorporated mysticism were\nMullā ‘Abd al-Ḥakīm Siyalkotī, Mullā\nMaḥmūd Junpurī Faruqī, and Mīrzā\nMuḥammad Zāhid Harawī (1603–1652), who became\nthe proponent of Suhrawardī’s illuminationist philosophy;\nand, perhaps the most well known philosopher-mystic, Shāh\nWaliullāh, who lived in the 18th century CE.\nWaliullāh made an attempt to reconcile\nIbn-‘Arabī’s doctrine of “The Unity of\nBeing” (waḥdat al-wūjūd) and\nSirhindī’s doctrine of “The Unity of\nConsciousness” (waḥdat al-shuhūd). In\naddition to his numerous writings on the foundation of Sufi\nmetaphysics, Shāh Waliullāh should be given credit for\nbringing legitimacy to mystical doctrine despite the attacks of\northodox jurists who saw Sufism as heretical. \nBack in Persia, came the advent of the Safavid dynasty in the\n16th century CE, the founders of which were practicing\nSufis affiliated with the grand Sufi master, Ṣafī\nal-Dīn Ardabīlī (1252–1334 CE). There the use of\nSufi doctrine, philosophy, and asceticism within a single\nphilosophical paradigm reached its pinnacle. The most important issue\nof what came to be called the “School of Isfahan” was the\n“reality of being” (ḥaqiqat\nal-wūjūd ) as opposed to the “concept of\nbeing” (mafhūm al-wūjūd). \nThe founder of the School of Isfahan, Mīr Dāmād (d.\n1631 or 1632 CE), was a follower of Suhrawardī’s philosophy\nof illumination, even choosing the pen name ishrāq\n(illumination). He not only wrote extensively on the metaphysical\nfoundation of mysticism in his major work Sparks of Fire\n(al-Qabasāt), and in his Ecstasies\n(Al-Jadhawāt), Heavenly Mystical States\n(Khalsat al-malakūt), and his Disassociations\n(al-Khl‘iyyāt), he also wrote mystical poetry.\nEven though Mīr Dāmād wrote extensively on peripatetic\nphilosophy, and especially the concept of time, he is to be credited\nwith a gnostic interpretation of Avicennan philosophy. His\nphilosophico-mystical structure, based on the principality of essence,\nprovides the intellectual frame work for the ascendance of the soul\nand its eventual unity with its source. \nIt was however, his student Ṣadr al-Dīn Shirāzī,\nknown as Mullā Ṣadrā, who is perhaps the greatest\nmetaphysician of the Islamic philosophical tradition. His grand\nsynthesis of discursive philosophy, intellectual intuition, and\nasceticism came to be known as the “Transcendental\nTheo-Sophy” (al-ḥikmat\nal-muta‘āliyah). This philosophical perspective,\naccording to Mullā Ṣadrā, was unveiled to him by God\nafter many years of inner purification. With Mullā\nṢadrā, an attempt to offer a spiritual commentary\n(ta’wīl) from a Shi‘ite gnostic perspective\non the Qur’an and the concept of “spiritual\nguardianship” (wilāyah) reaches its pinnacle. \nHis magnum opus, The Four Journeys of the Intellect\n(al-Asfār al-arba‘āt al-‘aqliyyah) is a\nphilosophical and gnostic exposition of the highest caliber, in which\nthe descending and ascending journey of the soul from and to God is\ntreated in detail. This work, which is an encyclopedia of gnosis,\nphilosophy, and mysticism, incorporates much of what Ibn\n‘Arabī and other philosopher-mystics had brought forth to\ndate. For Mullā Ṣadrā, creation represents four\njourneys: the Fall, in which unity becomes multiplicity is the first,\nfollowed by one’s earthly journey wherein the pain of separation\ncauses an existential yearning towards one’s original abode.\nAccording to Mullā Ṣadrā, man’s spiritual\nascendance through the path of Sufism and gnosticism constitutes the\nthird part of this journey until unity once again is accomplished.\nFinally there is the sojourn in the Divine realm, from Truth\n(ḥaqq) to Truth, a station only few of the spiritual\nelites may ever experience. \nMullā Ṣadrā can be regarded as the reviver of the\nauthentic mystical wisdom to be attained through mysticism and the\nintellectual intuition not divorced from rationality. Mullā\nṢadrā makes extensive use of logical analyses and\ndemonstrative proofs, which rest on what he calls “illuminative\nprinciple” (qā‘idah ishraqiyyah); that is,\nwhat has entered the heart (al-varidāt al-qalbiyyah), or\n“Divinely realized knowledge” (taḥqīq\n‘arshī). \nSome works that are indicative of his commitment to philosophical\nmysticism are, Metaphysical Penetrations\n(al-Mashāri‘), Wisdom of the Throne\n(Ḥikmat al-‘arshiyah), The Unity of the\nKnower and the Known (Ittiḥād al-‘āqil\nwa’l-ma‘qūl), and Secrets of the\nQur’anic Verses (Asrār al-āyāt), a\ngnostic commentary on the famous light verses. \nMullā Ṣadrā left an indelible mark upon Islamic\nphilosophy, and especially on the nexus between philosophy and\nmysticism, making the integration of mysticism an assumed part of\nphilosophizing. His students carried out his philosophical legacy well\ninto the modern era. ‘Abd al-Razzāq Lāhijī (d.\n1661–1662 CE) wrote a commentary upon The Secrets of the\nGarden (Sharḥ-i gulshan-i rāz), which is a\ndetailed exposition of the spiritual path and one’s journey\nthrough the maze of the states and stations of the Sufi path, Mīr\nFindiriskī (d. 1640–41 CE) wrote a mystical commentary upon\nYoga Vaishishe, and Mullā Muḥsin Fayḍ\nKāshānī (d. 1680 CE) wrote a mystical treatise entitled\nThe Hidden Words (Kalimāt-i maknunah) as well\nas Divine Gnosis (al-Ma‘ārif\nal-ilāhiyyah). Qāḍī Sa‘id Qummī\n(d. 1696 CE), another student of Mullā Ṣadrā and a\nstanch Neoplatonist authored a number of mystical treatises such as\nthe Secrets of Worships (Asrār\nal-‘ibādāt) as well as a major gnostic work\ntitled Commentary Upon The Enneads (Ta‘liqāt\nbar Uthūlūjiyā), scil. The pseudo-Aristotelian\nTheology of Aristotle, derived from the Enneads of\nPlotinus. (See infra The Theology of Aristotle by Peter\nAdamson.) \nThe above works, all of which are continuations of Ṣadrian\nphilosophy, further elaborate the fine points of transcendentalist\ntheo-sophy, which was firmly based on the principality of existence\nover essence, gradation, and the oneness that appears as multiplicity.\nThe question is how to transcend the world of objects which appears as\nmany, to see the Oneness which lies at the heart of multiplicity. The\npost Suhrawardīan and Sadrian answer is that a combination of\npractical wisdom and intellectual intuition which transcends\ndiscursive reasoning, provides one with the vision to see the Oneness\nlying at the heart of multiplicity. \nMuḥammad Jalāl al-Dīn Balkhī, better known as\n“Rūmī,” is regarded by many to be one of the\ngreatest Sufi poets of the Islamic tradition. In his magnum opus,\nMathnawī, which has been called by some\n“The Persian Qur‘an,” Rūmī scorns\ndiscursive thought and ridicules philosophers for walking on wobbly\nstilts: \nNevertheless, he became an influential figure in the tradition of\npost-Avicennian philosophical Sufism. \nRūmī’s critique of Peripatetic philosophy is closer to\nGhazzālī’s critique of rationalism than an outright\nrejection of it. Advocating “epistemological humility,”\nRūmī offers a critique of such traditional epistemological\ntheories as truth by correspondence, authority, and reasoning while\nallowing for a more experiential aspect of truth. \nIn his Mathnawī, Rūmī criticizes the\nreliability of truth claims based on sensory perception as well: \nWhile the senses provide us with some knowledge, it is not a type of\nknowledge that can lead to the discovery of spiritual and existential\ntruth. \nRūmī also rejects the idea of “truth by\nauthority” and alludes to the dangers of blindly following those\nwho claim to know the truth. His critique is particularly aimed at\nMuslim jurists who adhere to the Divine command theory. \nAs to the application of reason, which is at the heart of\nphilosophical enterprise, Rūmī divides the intellect into\nuniversal intellect (‘aql-i kullī) and particular\nintellect (‘aql-i juz’ī). Whereas the\nuniversal intellect attends to the affairs of the Divine realm,\nthe particular intellect’s scope is restricted to this world. In\nresponse to the Muslim rationalists (Mu‘tazilites),\nRūmī states: \nAnd again Rūmī asserts: \nHaving criticized theories of truth by correspondence, authority, and\nreasoning, Rūmī advocates a more existential understanding\nof truth which he, along with many Islamic Philosophers, refer to as\nthe universal intellect. He tells us: \nPhilosophers’ reliance on reason alone clashes with the validity\nof knowledge by intuition and divine revelation according to\nRūmī: \nWhere Rūmī and some philosophers agree upon is the existence\nof the very faculty of intuition, which is often associated with the\nuniversal intellect. According to Rūmī, this faculty, which\nmust be ‘awakened’ by practicing the arduous process of\nthe mystical path, leads to the awakening of the five internal\nspiritual senses that complement the five external\nphysical senses. All the ten senses are controlled by the symbolic\n“heart”—the organ of supersensory perception. \nThere are five [spiritual] senses besides these five [physical] senses\n\nThe former are like red gold and the latter like copper.\n\nIn the marketplace where the expert connoisseurs are busy\n\nHow should the copper and golden senses be priced the same?\n\nThe physical senses’ nutriment is murky and tenebrous;\n\nThe spiritual sense sups and dines on the sun (Nicholson, II:\n49–51) \nBe silent, be silent, drink silently.\n\nVeil yourself, veil yourself for you are the hidden treasure.\n\nSpeak not, speak not of this exposition of my heart\n\nSo you be not bewildered, so you do not remain perplexed\n\n(Kulliyāt-i Shams, vol. 2, ghazal 637, vv. 6649,\n6653) \nRūmī’s impact on Islamic philosophy can be seen in\nvarious commentaries on philosophical gnosticism that were influenced\nby Rūmī’s works. The tradition of writing commentaries\nor quoting Rūmī, which appears in the works of Mullā\nṢadrā, Lāhijī, and Sabziwārī continues\nwell into the modern era. \nEven though post Sadrian philosophy in the Islamic tradition never\nreached the level of accomplishment of the great masters of the\nSafavid period, Sadra’s school of metaphysics found followers in\nthe periods that were to follow, both in and outside of Persia. While\nMullā Ṣadrā’s influence was marginal in the Arab\nworld, which has generally seemed to distance itself from traditional\nmetaphysical issues, in India, Ṣadrian philosophy was well\nreceived and it is taught in traditional schools today. \nWith the advent of the Qājār dynasty in Iran in the early\n18th century CE., Ṣadrian philosophy once again\nbecame the focal point of philosophical activity. The greatest\nproponents of gnosis and philosophical mysticism in this period came\nto be known as the “School of Tehran.” This school\nincluded Mullā ‘Alī Nurī (d. 1830–1 CE)\nwhose Glosses upon the Secrets of Verses is an esoteric\ncommentary on certain verses of the Qur’an, Mullā\nIsmā‘īl Khāju‘ī (d. 1759 CE), who\nwrote on the concept of time within a gnostic context, and the most\ncelebrated figure in this period, Ḥājj Mullā\nHādī Sabziwārī (1797–1873 CE) whose\nCommentary on Treatises (Sharḥ-i\nmanẓumah) is a compendium of philosophical gnosticism.\nSabziwārī, who also wrote mystical poetry under the pen-name\nAsrār (Secrets), brought about a rapprochement\namong many different strands of mystical philosophy and considered\nasceticism to be a central part of living a philosophical life. With\nSabziwārī’s death in 1797 CE., Tehran became the\ncenter of philosophical activity, much of which centered around the\nphilosophy of Mullā Ṣadrā and Sabziwārī. The\nsalient features of the School of Tehran were that knowledge is\nhierarchical in essence and that discursive philosophy, while useful,\nis ultimately limited. In this tradition, it is through intellectual\nintuition, illumination, and inner purification that the reality of\nexistence can be experienced (Sabzavārī 1969;\nAshtiyānī 1973) . Among other masters of this period are\nMullā ‘Abdallāh Zunuzī (d. 1841–42 CE), the\nauthor of Divine Flashes of Light (al-Lama‘āt\nal-ilāhiyyah), and his son, Mullā ‘Alī\nZunuzī (d. 1889–1900 CE), who authored Marvels of\nWisdom (Badāyi‘ al-ḥikam). Both of\ntheir works are gnostic and mystical commentaries upon a wide range of\nphilosophical problems. Because the School of Tehran was dominated by\ngrand scholars who were also jurists, it continued in the\nṢadrian and Sabziwārian tradition, but distanced itself\nfrom popular Sufism, with whom they identified relaxed attitude and\neven antinomian tendencies towards Islamic law\n(Shari‘ah). Emphasis on piety, asceticism, and\ncleansing of the soul within the prescribed limits of the\nShari‘ah, perhaps partially a reaction to modernity, is\nthe salient feature of the School of Tehran. \nThe number of Muslim philosophers who became proponents of mystical\nphilosophy in the Islamic world are too numerous to mention here, but\nclearly mysticism is a living tradition that continues to occupy\ncenter stage in the philosophy in the Muslim world. It is virtually\nimpossible to fully account for all the traditions of mysticism in the\nIslamic philosophical tradition, however such traditions do exist in\nalmost every Muslim country today (see Kiliç 1996). \nThe impact of mysticism on Islamic philosophy has been so profound\nthat it has changed the very essence and definition of philosophizing.\nThe enterprise of philosophizing in the Islamic tradition is seen by\nmost not merely as an intellectual exercise but as the intellectual\ndimension of the soul’s spiritual journey towards the unveiling\nof truth. Authentic philosophy, according to Muslim\nphilosopher-mystics is therefore committed to providing a\nrationalistic commentary upon those issues which traditionally\nbelonged to the mystical domain only.","contact.mail":"maminraz@umw.edu","contact.domain":"umw.edu"}]
