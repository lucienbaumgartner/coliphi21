His contributions to\ntwentieth-century philosophy of science, though of comparable\nimportance, are less well known. Einstein’s own philosophy of science\nis an original synthesis of elements drawn from sources as diverse as\nneo-Kantianism, conventionalism, and logical empiricism, its\ndistinctive feature being its novel blending of realism with a holist,\nunderdeterminationist form of conventionalism. Of special note is the\nmanner in which Einstein’s philosophical thinking was driven by and\ncontributed to the solution of problems first encountered in his work\nin physics. Equally significant are Einstein’s relations with and\ninfluence on other prominent twentieth-century philosophers of\nscience, including Moritz Schlick, Hans Reichenbach, Ernst Cassirer,\nPhilipp Frank, Henri Bergson, Émile Meyerson.\n\nLate in 1944, Albert Einstein received a letter from Robert Thornton,\na young African-American philosopher of science who had just finished\nhis Ph.D. under Herbert Feigl at Minnesota and was beginning a new job\nteaching physics at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez. He had\nwritten to solicit from Einstein a few supportive words on behalf of\nhis efforts to introduce “as much of the philosophy of science\nas possible” into the modern physics course that he was to teach\nthe following spring (Thornton to Einstein, 28 November 1944, EA\n61–573). Here is what Einstein offered in reply: \nThat Einstein meant what he said about the relevance of philosophy to\nphysics is evidenced by the fact that he had been saying more or less\nthe same thing for decades. Thus, in a 1916 memorial note for Ernst\nMach, a physicist and philosopher to whom Einstein owed a special\ndebt, he wrote: \nHow, exactly, does the philosophical habit of mind provide the\nphysicist with such “independence of judgment”? Einstein\ngoes on to explain: \nOne is not surprised at Einstein’s then citing Mach’s critical\nanalysis of the Newtonian conception of absolute space as a paradigm\nof what Mach, himself, termed the “historical-critical”\nmethod of philosophical analysis (Einstein 1916, 101, citing Ch. 2,\n§§ 6–7 of Mach’s Mechanik, most likely the\nthird edition, Mach 1897).  \nThe place of philosophy in physics was a theme to which Einstein\nreturned time and again, it being clearly an issue of deep importance\nto him. Sometimes he adopts a modest pose, as in this oft-quoted\nremark from his 1933 Spencer Lecture: \nMore typical, however, is the confident pose he struck three years\nlater in “Physics and Reality”:  \nWhat kind of philosophy might we expect from the\nphilosopher-physicist? One thing that we should not expect from a\nphysicist who takes the philosophical turn in order to help solve\nfundamental physical problems is a systematic philosophy: \nBut what strikes the “systematic epistemologist” as mere\nopportunism might appear otherwise when viewed from the perspective of\na physicist engaged, as Einstein himself put it, in “the\ncritical contemplation of the theoretical foundations.” The\noverarching goal of that critical contemplation was, for Einstein, the\ncreation of a unified foundation for physics after the model of a\nfield theory like general relativity (see Sauer 2014 for non-technical\noverview on Einstein’s approach to the unified field theory program).\nEinstein failed in his quest, but there was a consistency and\nconstancy in the striving that informed as well the philosophy of\nscience developing hand in hand with the scientific project. \nIndeed, from early to late a few key ideas played the central, leading\nrole in Einstein’s philosophy of science, ideas about which Einstein\nevinced surprisingly little doubt even while achieving an ever deeper\nunderstanding of their implications. For the purposes of the following\ncomparatively brief overview, we can confine our attention to just\nfive topics: \nThe emphasis on the continuity and coherence in the development of\nEinstein’s philosophy of science contrasts with an account such as\nGerald Holton’s (1968), which claims to find a major philosophical\nbreak in the mid-1910s, in the form of a turn away from a sympathy for\nan anti-metaphysical positivism and toward a robust scientific\nrealism. Holton sees this turn being driven by Einstein’s alleged\nrealization that general relativity, by contrast with special\nrelativity, requires a realistic ontology. However, Einstein was\nprobably never an ardent “Machian”\n positivist,[1]\n and he was never a scientific realist, at least not in the sense\nacquired by the term “scientific realist” in later\ntwentieth century philosophical discourse (see Howard 1993). Einstein\nexpected scientific theories to have the proper empirical credentials,\nbut he was no positivist; and he expected scientific theories to give\nan account of physical reality, but he was no scientific realist.\nMoreover, in both respects his views remained more or less the same\nfrom the beginning to the end of his career. \nWhy Einstein did not think himself a realist (he said so explicitly)\nis discussed below. Why he is not to be understood as a positivist\ndeserves a word or two of further discussion here, if only because the\nbelief that he was sympathetic to positivism, at least early in his\nlife, is so widespread (for a fuller discussion, see Howard 1993).\n \nThat Einstein later repudiated positivism is beyond doubt. Many\nremarks from at least the early 1920s through the end of his life make\nthis clear. In 1946 he explained what he took to be Mach’s basic\nerror: \nIs Einstein here also criticizing his own youthful philosophical\nindiscretions? The very example that Einstein gives here makes any\nsuch interpretation highly implausible, because one of Einstein’s main\ngoals in his early work on Brownian motion (Einstein 1905b) was\nprecisely to prove the reality of atoms, this in the face of the then\nfamous skepticism of thinkers like Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald: \nWhy, then, is the belief in Einstein’s early sympathy for positivism\nso well entrenched?  \nThe one piece of evidence standardly cited for a youthful flirtation\nwith positivism is Einstein’s critique of the notion of absolute\ndistant simultaneity in his 1905 paper on special relativity (Einstein\n1905c). Einstein speaks there of “observers,” but in an\nepistemologically neutral way that can be replaced by talk of an\ninertial frame of reference. What really bothers Einstein about\ndistant simultaneity is not that it is observationally inaccessible\nbut that it involves a two-fold arbitrariness, one in the choice of an\ninertial frame of reference and one in the stipulation within a given\nframe of a convention regarding the ratio of the times required for a\nlight signal to go from one stationary observer to another and back\nagain. Likewise, Einstein faults classical Maxwellian electrodynamics\nfor an asymmetry in the way it explains electromagnetic induction\ndepending on whether it is the coil or the magnet that is assumed to\nbe at rest. If the effect is the same—a current in the\ncoil—why, asks Einstein, should there be two different\nexplanations: an electrical field created in the vicinity of a moving\nmagnet or an electromotive force induced in a conductor moving through\na stationary magnetic field? To be sure, whether it is the coil or the\nmagnet that is taken to be at rest makes no observable difference, but\nthe problem, from Einstein’s point of view, is the asymmetry in the\ntwo explanations. Even the young Einstein was no positivist. \nFirst generation logical empiricists sought to legitimate their\nmovement in part by claiming Einstein as a friend. They may be\nforgiven their putting a forced interpretation on arguments taken out\nof context. We can do better. \nEinstein’s philosophy of science is an original synthesis drawing upon\nmany philosophical resources, from neo-Kantianism to Machian\nempiricism and Duhemian conventionalism. Other thinkers and movements,\nmost notably the logical empiricists, drew upon the same resources.\nBut Einstein put the pieces together in a manner importantly different\nfrom Moritz Schlick, Hans Reichenbach, and Rudolf Carnap, and he\nargued with them for decades about who was right (however much they\nobscured these differences in representing Einstein publicly as a\nfriend of logical empiricism and scientific philosophy). Starting from\nthe mid-1920s till the end of the decade Einstein show some interest\nin the rationalistic realism of Émile Meyerson (Einstein, 1928;\ncf. Giovanelli 2018; on the contemporary debate between Einstein and\nBergson, see Canales 2015). Understanding how Einstein puts those\npieces together therefore sheds light not only on the philosophical\naspect of his own achievements in physics but also upon the larger\nhistory of the development of the philosophy of science in the\ntwentieth century. \nAny philosophy of science must include an account of the relation\nbetween theory and evidence. Einstein learned about the historicity of\nscientific concepts from Mach. But his preferred way of modeling the\nlogical relationship between theory and evidence was inspired mainly\nby his reading of Pierre Duhem’s La Théorie physique: son\nobjet et sa structure (Duhem 1906). Einstein probably first read\nDuhem, or at least learned the essentials of Duhem’s philosophy of\nscience around the fall of 1909, when, upon returning to Zurich from\nthe patent office in Bern to take up his first academic appointment at\nthe University of Zurich, he became the upstairs neighbor of his old\nfriend and fellow Zurich physics student, Friedrich Adler. Just a few\nmonths before, Adler had published the German translation of La\nThéorie physique (Duhem 1908), and the philosophy of\nscience became a frequent topic of conversation between the new\nneighbors, Adler and Einstein (see Howard 1990a). \nTheoretical holism and the underdetermination of theory choice by\nempirical evidence are the central theses in Duhem’s philosophy of\nscience. His argument, in brief, is that at least in sciences like\nphysics, where experiment is dense with sophisticated instrumentation\nwhose employment itself requires theoretical interpretation,\nhypotheses are not tested in isolation but only as part of whole\nbodies of theory. It follows that when there is a conflict between\ntheory and evidence, the fit can be restored in a multiplicity of\ndifferent ways. No statement is immune to revision because of a\npresumed status as a definition or thanks to some other a priori\nwarrant, and most any statement can be retained on pain of suitable\nadjustments elsewhere in the total body of theory. Hence, theory\nchoice is underdetermined by evidence. \nThat Einstein’s exposure to Duhem’s philosophy of science soon left\nits mark is evident from lecture notes that Einstein prepared for a\ncourse on electricity and magnetism at the University of Zurich in the\nwinter semester of 1910/11. Einstein asks how one can assign a\ndefinite electrical charge everywhere within a material body, if the\ninterior of the body is not accessible to test particles. A\n“Machian” positivist would deem such direct empirical\naccess necessary for meaningful talk of a charge distribution in the\ninterior of a sold. Einstein argues otherwise: \nWe find that such an el. continuum is always applicable only for the\nrepresentation of el. states of affairs in the interior of ponderable\nbodies. Here too we define the vector of el. field strength as the\nvector of the mech. force exerted on the unit of pos. electr. quantity\ninside a body. But the force so defined is no longer directly\naccessible to exp. It is one part of a theoretical construction that\ncan be correct or false, i.e., consistent or not consistent with\nexperience, only as a whole. (Collected Papers of Albert\nEinstein, hereafter CPAE, Vol. 3, Doc. 11 [pp.\n12–13]) \nOne can hardly ask for a better summary of Duhem’s point of view in\napplication to a specific physical theory. Explicit citations of Duhem\nby Einstein are rare (for details, see Howard 1990a). But explicit\ninvocations of a holist picture of the structure and empirical\ninterpretation of theories started to prevail at the turn of the\n1920s. \nDuring the decade 1905–1915, Einstein had more or less explicitly\nassumed that in a good theory there are certain individual\nparts that can be directly coordinated with the behavior of\nphysically-existent objects used as probes. A theory can be said to be\n‘true or false’ if such objects respectively behave or do\nnot behave as predicted. In special relativity, as in classical\nmechanics, the fundamental geometrical/kinematical variables, the\nspace and time coordinates, are measured with rods and clocks\nseparately from the other non-geometrical variables, say, charge\nelectric field strengths, which were supposed to be defined by\nmeasuring the force on a charge test particle. In general relativity,\ncoordinates are no longer directly measurable independently from the\ngravitational field. Still, the line element \\(ds\\) (distance\nbetween nearby spacetime points) was supposed to have a\n‘natural’ distance that can be measured with rods and\nclocks. In the late 1910s, pressed by the epistemological objections\nraised by different interlocutors—in particular Hermann Weyl\n(Ryckman 2005) and the young Wolfgang Pauli (Stachel,\n2005)—Einstein was forced to recognize that this epistemological\nmodel was at most a provisional compromise. In principle rod- and\nclock-like structures should emerge as solutions of a future\nrelativistic theory of matter, possibly a field theory encompassing\ngravitation and electromagnetism. In this context, the sharp\ndistinction between rods and clocks that serve to define the\ngeometrical/kinematical structure of the theory and other material\nsystems would become questionable. Einstein regarded such distinction\nas provisionally necessary, give the current state of physics.\nHowever, he recognized that in principle a physical theory should\nconstruct rods and clocks as solutions to its equations (see Ryckman\n2017, ch. VII for an overview on Einstein view on the relation between\ngeometry and experience).  \nEinstein addressed this issue in several popular writings during the\n1920s, in particular, the famous lecture Geometrie und\nErfahrung (Einstein 1921, see also Einstein, 1923, Einstein,\n1924, Einstein 1926; Einstein 1926; see Giovanelli 2014 for an\noverview). Sub specie temporis, he argued, it was useful to\ncompare the geometrical/kinematical structures of the theory with\nexperience separately from the rest of physics. Sub specie\naeterni, however, only geometry and physics taken together can be\nsaid to be ‘true or false.’ This epistemological model\nbecame more appropriate, while Einstein was moving beyond general\nrelativity in the direction of theory unifying the gravitational and\nthe electromagnetic field. Einstein had to rely on progressively more\nabstract geometrical structures which could not be defined in terms of\nthe behavior of some physical probes. Thus, the use of such structures\nwas justified because of their role in the theory as a whole. In the\nsecond half of the 1920s, in correspondence with Reichenbach\n(Giovanelli 2017) and Meyerson (Giovanelli 2018), Einstein even denied\nthat the very distinction between geometrical and non-geometrical is\nmeaningful (Lehmkuhl 2014).  \nA different, but especially interesting example of Einstein’s reliance\non a form of theoretical holism is found in a review that Einstein\nwrote in 1924 of Alfred Elsbach’s Kant und Einstein (1924),\none of the flood of books and articles then trying to reconcile the\nKant’s philosophy. Having asserted that relativity theory is\nincompatible with Kant’s doctrine of the a priori, Einstein explains\nwhy, more generally, he is not sympathetic with Kant: \nEinstein’s point seems to be that while one can always choose to\ndesignate selected elements as a priori and, hence, non-empirical, no\nprinciple determines which elements can be so designated, and our\nability thus to designate them derives from the fact that it is only\nthe totality of the elements that possesses empirical content. \nMuch the same point could be made, and was made by Duhem himself (see\nDuhem 1906, part 2, ch. 6, sects. 8 and 9), against those who would\ninsulate certain statements against empirical refutation by claiming\nfor them the status of conventional definitions. Edouard Le Roy (1901)\nhad argued thus about the law of free fall. It could not be refuted by\nexperiment because it functioned as a definition of “free\nfall.” And Henri Poincaré (1901) said much the same about\nthe principles of mechanics more generally. As Einstein answered the\nneo-Kantians, so Duhem answered this species of conventionalist: Yes,\nexperiment cannot refute, say, the law of free fall by itself, but\nonly because it is part of a larger theoretical whole that has\nempirical content only as a whole, and various other elements of that\nwhole could as well be said to be, alone, immune to refutation. \nThat Einstein should deploy against the neo-Kantians in the early\n1920s the argument that Duhem used against the conventionalism of\nPoincaré and Le Roy is interesting from the point of view of\nEinstein’s relationships with those who were leading the development\nof logical empiricism and scientific philosophy in the 1920s,\nespecially Schlick and Reichenbach. Einstein shared with Schlick and\nReichenbach the goal of crafting a new form of empiricism that would\nbe adequate to the task of defending general relativity against\nneo-Kantian critiques (see Schlick 1917 and 1921, and Reichenbach\n1920, 1924, and 1928; for more detail, see Howard 1994a). But while\nthey all agreed that what Kant regarded as the a priori element in\nscientific cognition was better understood as a conventional moment in\nscience, they were growing to disagree dramatically over the nature\nand place of conventions in science. The classic logical empiricist\nview that the moment of convention was restricted to conventional\ncoordinating definitions that endow individual primitive terms, worked\nwell, but did not comport well with the holism about theories \nIt was this argument over the nature and place of conventions in\nscience that underlies Einstein’s gradual philosophical estrangement\nfrom Schlick and Reichenbach in the 1920s. Serious in its own right,\nthe argument over conventions was entangled with two other issues as\nwell, namely, realism and Einstein’s famous view of theories as the\n“free creations of the human spirit” (see, for example,\nEinstein 1921). In both instances what troubled Einstein was that a\nverificationist semantics made the link between theory and experience\ntoo strong, leaving too small a role for theory, itself, and the\ncreative theorizing that produces it. \nIf theory choice is empirically determinate, especially if theoretical\nconcepts are explicitly constructed from empirical primitives, as in\nCarnap’s program in the Aufbau (Carnap 1928), then it is hard\nto see how theory gives us a story about anything other than\nexperience. As noted, Einstein was not what we would today call a\nscientific realist, but he still believed that there was content in\ntheory beyond mere empirical content (on the relations between\nEinstein’s realism and constructism see Ryckman 2017, ch. 8 and 9). He\nbelieved that theoretical science gave us a window on nature itself,\neven if, in principle, there will be no one uniquely correct story at\nthe level of deep ontology (see below, section 5). And if the only\nchoice in theory choice is one among conventional coordinating\ndefinitions, then that is no choice at all, a point stressed by\nReichenbach, especially, as an important positive implication of his\nposition. Reichenbach argued that if empirical content is the only\ncontent, then empirically equivalent theories have the same content,\nthe difference resulting from their different choices of coordinating\ndefinitions being like in kind to the difference between “es\nregnet” and “il pleut,” or the difference between\nexpressing the result of a measurement in English or metric units,\njust two different ways of saying the same thing. But then, Einstein\nwould ask, where is there any role for the creative intelligence of\nthe theoretical physicist if there is no room for genuine choice in\nscience, if experience somehow dictates theory construction? \nThe argument over the nature and role of conventions in science\ncontinued to the very end of Einstein’s life, reaching its highest\nlevel of sophistication in the exchange between Reichenbach and\nEinstein the Library of Living Philosopher’s volume, Albert\nEinstein: Philosopher-Physicist (Schilpp 1949). The question is,\nagain, whether the choice of a geometry is empirical, conventional, or\na priori. In his contribution, Reichenbach reasserted his old view\nthat once an appropriate coordinating definition is established,\nequating some “practically rigid rod” with the geometer’s\n“rigid body,” then the geometry of physical space is\nwholly determined by empirical evidence: \nEinstein’s clever reply includes a dialogue between two characters,\n“Reichenbach” and “Poincaré,” in which\n“Reichenbach” concedes to “Poincaré”\nthat there are no perfectly rigid bodies in nature and that physics\nmust be used to correct for such things as thermal deformations, from\nwhich it follows that what we actually test is geometry plus physics,\nnot geometry alone. Here an “anonymous non-positivist”\ntakes “Poincaré’s” place, out of respect, says\nEinstein, “for Poincaré’s superiority as thinker and\nauthor” (Einstein 1949, 677), but also, perhaps, because he\nrealized that the point of view that follows was more Duhem than\nPoincaré. The “non-positivist” then argues that\none’s granting that geometry and physics are tested together\ncontravenes the positivist identification of meaning with\nverifiability: \nTwo years before the Quine’s publication of “Two Dogmas of\nEmpiricism” (1951), Einstein here makes explicit the semantic\nimplications of a thoroughgoing holism. \nIf theory choice is empirically underdetermined, then an obvious\nquestion is why we are so little aware of the underdetermination in\nthe day-to-day conduct of science. In a 1918 address celebrating Max\nPlanck’s sixtieth birthday, Einstein approached this question via a\ndistinction between practice and principle: \nBut why is theory choice, in practice, seemingly empirically\ndetermined? Einstein hinted at an answer the year before in a letter\nto Schlick, where he commended Schlick’s argument that the deep\nelements of a theoretical ontology have as much claim to the status of\nthe real as do Mach’s elements of sensation (Schlick 1917), but\nsuggested that we are nonetheless speaking of two different kinds of\nreality. How do they differ? \nIf two different peoples pursue physics independently of one another,\nthey will create systems that certainly agree as regards the\nimpressions (“elements” in Mach’s sense). The mental\nconstructions that the two devise for connecting these\n“elements” can be vastly different. And the two\nconstructions need not agree as regards the “events”; for\nthese surely belong to the conceptual constructions. Certainly on the\n“elements,” but not the “events,” are real in\nthe sense of being “given unavoidably in experience.” \nBut if we designate as “real” that which we arrange in the\nspace-time-schema, as you have done in the theory of knowledge, then\nwithout doubt the “events,” above all, are real.…\nI would like to recommend a clean conceptual distinction\nhere. (Einstein to Schlick, 21 May 1917, CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc.\n343) \nWhy, in practice, are physicists unaware of underdetermination? It is\nbecause ours is not the situation of “two different peoples\npursu[ing] physics independently of one another.” Though\nEinstein does not say it explicitly, the implication seems to be that\napparent determination in theory choice is mainly a consequence of our\nall being similarly socialized as we become members of a common\nscientific community. Part of what it means to be a member of a such a\ncommunity is that we have been taught to make our theoretical choices\nin accord with criteria or values that we hold in common.  \nFor Einstein, as for many others, simplicity is the criterion that\nmainly steers theory choice in domains where experiment and\nobservation no longer provide an unambiguous guide. This, too, is a\ntheme sounded early and late in Einstein’s philosophical reflections\n(for more detail, see Howard 1998, Norton 2000, van Dongen 2002, 2010,\nGiovanelli 2018). For example, the just-quoted remark from 1918 about\nthe apparent determination of theory choice in practice, contrasted\nwith in-principle underdetermination continues: \nThere is more than a little autobiography here, for as Einstein\nstressed repeatedly in later years, he understood the success of his\nown quest for a general theory of relativity as a result of his\nseeking the simplest set of field equations satisfying a given set of\nconstraints. \nEinstein’s celebration of simplicity as a guide to theory choice comes\nclearly to the fore in the early 1930s, when he was immersed his\nproject of a unified field theory (see, van Dongen 2010 for a\nreconstruction of the philosophical underpinning of Einstein’s search\nof a unified field theory). Witness what he wrote in his 1933 Herbert\nSpencer lecture: \nTo these questions, I answer with complete confidence, that, in my\nopinion, the right way exists, and that we are capable of finding it.\nOur experience hitherto justifies us in trusting that nature is the\nrealization of the simplest that is mathematically conceivable. I am\nconvinced that purely mathematical construction enables us to find\nthose concepts and those lawlike connections between them that provide\nthe key to the understanding of natural phenomena. Useful mathematical\nconcepts may well be suggested by experience, but in no way can they\nbe derived from it. Experience naturally remains the sole criterion of\nthe usefulness of a mathematical construction for physics. But the\nactual creative principle lies in mathematics. Thus, in a certain\nsense, I take it to be true that pure thought can grasp the real, as\nthe ancients had dreamed. (Einstein 1933, p. 183; Howard’s\ntranslation) \nEinstein’s conviction that the theoretical physicist must trust\nsimplicity is that his work was moving steadily into domains ever\nfurther removed from direct contact with observation and experiment.\nEinstein started to routinely claim that this was the lesson he had\ndrawn from the way in which he had found general relativity (Norton\n2000). There are, however, good reasons to think that Einstein’s\nselective recollections (Jannsen and Renn 2007) were instrumental to\nhis defense of relying on a purely mathematical strategy in the search\nfor a unified field theory (van Dongen 2010):  \nWhat warrant is there for thus trusting in simplicity? At best one can\ndo a kind of meta-induction. That “the totality of all sensory\nexperience can be ‘comprehended’ on the basis of a\nconceptual system built on premises of great simplicity” will be\nderided by skeptics as a “miracle creed,” but, Einstein\nadds, “it is a miracle creed which has been borne out to an\namazing extent by the development of science” (Einstein 1950, p.\n342). The success of previous physical theories justifies our trusting\nthat nature is the realization of the simplest that is mathematically\nconceivable \nBut for all that Einstein’s faith in simplicity was strong, he\ndespaired of giving a precise, formal characterization of how we\nassess the simplicity of a theory. In 1946 he wrote about the\nperspective of simplicity (here termed the “inner\nperfection” of a theory): \nAs in 1918, so in 1946 and beyond, Einstein continues to be impressed\nthat the “oracles,” presumably the leaders of the relevant\nscientific community, tend to agree in their judgments of simplicity.\nThat is why, in practice, simplicity seems to determine theory choice\nunivocally. \nIn the physics and philosophy of science literature of the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the principle according to\nwhich scientific theorizing should strive for a univocal\nrepresentation of nature was widely and well known under the name that\nit was given in the title of a widely-cited essay by Joseph Petzoldt,\n“The Law of Univocalness” [“Das Gesetz der\nEindeutigkeit”] (Petzoldt 1895). An indication that the map of\nphilosophical positions was drawn then in a manner very different from\ntoday is to found in the fact that this principle found favor among\nboth anti-metaphysical logical empiricists, such as Carnap, and\nneo-Kantians, such as Cassirer. It played a major role in debates over\nthe ontology of general relativity and was an important part of the\nbackground to the development of the modern concept of categoricity in\nformal semantics (for more on the history, influence, and demise of\nthe principle of univocalness, see Howard 1992 and 1996). One can find\nno more ardent and consistent champion of the principle than\nEinstein. \nThe principle of univocalness should not be mistaken for a denial of\nthe underdetermination thesis. The latter asserts that a multiplicity\nof theories can equally well account for a given body of empirical\nevidence, perhaps even the infinity of all possible evidence in the\nextreme, Quinean version of the thesis. The principle of univocalness\nasserts (in a somewhat anachronistic formulation) that any one theory,\neven any one among a set of empirically equivalent theories, should\nprovide a univocal representation of nature by determining for itself\nan isomorphic set of models. The unambiguous determination of theory\nchoice by evidence is not the same thing as the univocal determination\nof a class of models by a theory. \nThe principle of univocalness played a central role in Einstein’s\nstruggles to formulate the general theory of relativity. When, in\n1913, Einstein wrongly rejected a fully generally covariant theory of\ngravitation, he did so in part because he thought, wrongly, that\ngenerally covariant field equations failed the test of univocalness.\nMore specifically, he reasoned wrongly that for a region of spacetime\ndevoid of matter and energy—a “hole”—generally\ncovariant field equations permit the construction of two different\nsolutions, different in the sense that, in general, for spacetime\npoints inside the hole, they assign different values of the metric\ntensor to one and the same point (for more on the history of this\nepisode, see Stachel 1980 and Norton 1984). But Einstein’s “hole\nargument” is wrong, and his own diagnosis of the error in 1915\nrests again, ironically, on a deployment of the principle of\nunivocalness. What Einstein realized in 1915 was that, in 1913, he was\nwrongly assuming that a coordinate chart sufficed to fix the identity\nof spacetime manifold points. The application of a coordinate chart\ncannot suffice to individuate manifold points precisely because a\ncoordinate chart is not an invariant labeling scheme, whereas\nunivocalness in the representation of nature requires such invariance\n(see Howard and Norton 1993 and Howard 1999 for further\ndiscussion). \nHere is how Einstein explained his change of perspective in a letter\nto Paul Ehrenfest of 26 December 1915, just a few weeks after the\npublication of the final, generally covariant formulation of the\ngeneral theory of relativity: \nIn place of §12, the following reflections must appear. The\nphysically real in the universe of events (in contrast to that which\nis dependent upon the choice of a reference system) consists in\nspatiotemporal coincidences.* [Footnote *: and in nothing\nelse!] Real are, e.g., the intersections of two different world lines,\nor the statement that they do not intersect. Those statements\nthat refer to the physically real therefore do not founder on any\nunivocal coordinate transformation. If two systems of the\n\\(g_{\\mu v}\\) (or in\ngeneral the variables employed in the description of the world) are so\ncreated that one can obtain the second from the first through mere\nspacetime transformation, then they are completely equivalent. For\nthey have all spatiotemporal point coincidences in common, i.e.,\neverything that is observable. \nThese reflections show at the same time how natural the demand for\ngeneral covariance is. (CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 173) \nEinstein’s new point of view, according to which the physically real\nconsists exclusively in that which can be constructed on the basis of\nspacetime coincidences, spacetime points, for example, being regarded\nas intersections of world lines, is now known as the\n“point-coincidence argument.” Einstein might have been\ninspired by a paper by the young mathematician Erich Kretschmann\n(Howard and Norton 1993; cf. Giovanelli 2013) or possibly by a\nconversation with Schlick (Engler and Renn, 2017). Spacetime\ncoincidences play this privileged ontic role because they are\ninvariant and, thus, univocally determined. Spacetime\ncoordinates lack such invariance, a circumstance that\nEinstein thereafter repeatedly formulated as the claim that space and\ntime “thereby lose the last vestige of physical reality”\n(see, for example, Einstein to Ehrenfest, 5 January 1916, CPAE, Vol. 8,\nDoc. 180). \nOne telling measure of the philosophical importance of Einstein’s new\nperspective on the ontology of spacetime is the fact that Schlick\ndevoted his first book, Raum und Zeit in den gegenwärtigen\nPhysik (1917), a book for which Einstein had high praise (see\nHoward 1984 and 1999). But what most interested Einstein was Schlick’s\ndiscussion of the reality concept. Schlick argued that Mach was wrong\nto regard only the elements of sensation as real. Spacetime events,\nindividuated invariantly as spacetime coincidences, have as much or\nmore right to be taken as real, precisely because of the univocal\nmanner of their determination. Einstein wholeheartedly agreed, though\nhe ventured the above-quoted suggestion that one should distinguish\nthe two kinds of reality—that of the elements and that of the\nspacetime events—on the ground that if “two different\npeoples” pursued physics independently of one another they were\nfated to agree about the elements but would almost surely produce\ndifferent theoretical constructions at the level of the spacetime\nevent ontology. Note, again, that underdetermination is not a failure\nof univocalness. Different though they will be, each people’s\ntheoretical construction of an event ontology would be expected to be\nunivocal. \nSchlick, of course, went on to become the founder of the Vienna\nCircle, a leading figure in the development of logical empiricism, a\nchampion of verificationism. That being so, an important question\narises about Schlick’s interpretation of Einstein on the univocal\ndetermination of spacetime events as spacetime coincidences. The\nquestion is this: Do such univocal coincidences play such a privileged\nrole because of their reality or because of their observability.\nClearly the former—the reality of that which is univocally\ndetermined—is important. But are univocal spacetime coincidences\nreal because, thanks to their invariance, they are observable? Or is\ntheir observability consequent upon their invariant reality? Einstein,\nhimself, repeatedly stressed the observable character of spacetime\ncoincidences, as in the 26 December 1915 letter to Ehrenfest quoted\nabove (for additional references and a fuller discussion, see Howard\n 1999).[2] \nSchlick, still a self-described realist in 1917, was clear about the\nrelationship between observability and reality. He distinguished\nmacroscopic coincidences in the field of our sense experience, to\nwhich he does accord a privileged and foundational epistemic status,\nfrom the microscopic point coincidences that define an ontology of\nspacetime manifold points. Mapping the former onto the latter is, for\nSchlick, an important part of the business of confirmation, but the\nreality of the spacetime manifold points is in no way consequent upon\ntheir observability. Indeed, how, strictly speaking, can one even talk\nof the observation of infinitesimal spacetime coincidences of\nthe kind encountered in the intersection of two world lines? In fact,\nthe order of implication goes the other way: Spacetime events\nindividuated as spacetime coincidences are real because they are\ninvariant, and such observability as they might possess is consequent\nupon their status as invariant bits of physical reality. For Einstein,\nand for Schlick in 1917, understanding the latter—physical\nreality—is the goal of physical theory. \nAs we have seen, Schlick’s Raum und Zeit in den gegenwärtigen\nPhysik promoted a realistic interpretation of the ontology of\ngeneral relativity. After reading the manuscript early in 1917,\nEinstein wrote to Schlick on 21 May that “the last section\n‘Relations to Philosophy’ seems to me excellent”\n(CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 343), just the sort of praise one would expect from\na fellow realist. Three years earlier, the Bonn mathematician, Eduard\nStudy, had written another well-known, indeed very well-known defense\nof realism, Die realistische Weltansicht und die Lehre vom\nRaume (1914). Einstein read it in September of 1918. Much of it\nhe liked, especially the droll style, as he said to Study in a letter\nof 17 September (CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 618). Pressed by Study to say more\nabout the points where he disagreed, Einstein replied on 25 September\nin a rather surprising way: \nI am supposed to explain to you my doubts? By laying stress on these\nit will appear that I want to pick holes in you everywhere. But things\nare not so bad, because I do not feel comfortable and at home in any\nof the “isms.” It always seems to me as though such an ism\nwere strong only so long as it nourishes itself on the weakness of it\ncounter-ism; but if the latter is struck dead, and it is alone on an\nopen field, then it also turns out to be unsteady on its feet. So,\naway we go! \n“The physical world is real.” That is supposed to be the\nfundamental hypothesis. What does “hypothesis” mean here?\nFor me, a hypothesis is a statement, whose truth must be\nassumed for the moment, but whose meaning must be raised above all\nambiguity. The above statement appears to me, however, to be, in\nitself, meaningless, as if one said: “The physical world is\ncock-a-doodle-doo.” It appears to me that the “real”\nis an intrinsically empty, meaningless category (pigeon hole), whose\nmonstrous importance lies only in the fact that I can do certain\nthings in it and not certain others. This division is, to be sure, not\nan arbitrary one, but instead …. \nI concede that the natural sciences concern the “real,”\nbut I am still not a realist. (CPAE, Vol. 8, Doc. 624) \nLest there be any doubt that Einstein has little sympathy for the\nother side, he adds:  \nWhat could Einstein mean by saying that he concedes that the natural\nsciences concern the “real,” but that he is “still\nnot a realist” and that the “real” in the statement,\n“the physical world is real,” is an “intrinsically\nempty, meaningless category”? \nThe answer might be that realism, for Einstein, is not a philosophical\ndoctrine about the interpretation of scientific theories or the\nsemantics of theoretical\n terms.[3]\n For Einstein, realism is a physical postulate, one of a most\ninteresting kind, as he explained on 18 March 1948 in a long note at\nthe end of the manuscript of Max Born’s Waynflete Lectures,\nNatural Philosophy of Cause and Chance (1949), which Born had\nsent to Einstein for commentary: \nI just want to explain what I mean when I say that we should try to\nhold on to physical reality. We are, to be sure, all of us aware of\nthe situation regarding what will turn out to be the basic\nfoundational concepts in physics: the point-mass or the particle is\nsurely not among them; the field, in the Faraday - Maxwell sense,\nmight be, but not with certainty. But that which we conceive as\nexisting (’actual’) should somehow be localized in time and\nspace. That is, the real in one part of space, A, should (in theory)\nsomehow ‘exist’ independently of that which is thought of\nas real in another part of space, B. If a physical system stretches\nover the parts of space A and B, then what is present in B\nshould somehow have an existence independent of what is present in A.\nWhat is actually present in B should thus not depend upon the type of\nmeasurement carried out in the part of space, A; it should also be\nindependent of whether or not, after all, a measurement is made in\nA. \nIf one adheres to this program, then one can hardly view the\nquantum-theoretical description as a complete representation\nof the physically real. If one attempts, nevertheless, so to view it,\nthen one must assume that the physically real in B undergoes a sudden\nchange because of a measurement in A. My physical instincts bristle at\nthat suggestion. \nHowever, if one renounces the assumption that what is present in\ndifferent parts of space has an independent, real existence, then I do\nnot at all see what physics is supposed to describe. For what is\nthought to by a ‘system’ is, after all, just conventional,\nand I do not see how one is supposed to divide up the world\nobjectively so that one can make statements about the parts. (Born\n1969, 223–224; Howard’s translation) \nRealism is thus the thesis of spatial separability, the claim that\nspatial separation is a sufficient condition for the individuation of\nphysical systems, and its assumption is here made into almost a\nnecessary condition for the possibility of an intelligible science of\nphysics. \nThe postulate of spatial separability as that which undergirds the\nontic independence and, hence, individual identities of the systems\nthat physics describes was an important part of Einstein’s thinking\nabout the foundations of physics since at least the time of his very\nfirst paper on the quantum hypothesis in 1905 (Einstein 1905a; for\nmore detail on the early history of this idea in Einstein’s thinking,\nsee Howard 1990b). But the true significance of the separability\nprinciple emerged most clearly in 1935, when (as hinted in the\njust-quoted remark) Einstein made it one of the central premises of\nhis argument for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics (see Howard\n1985 and 1989). It is not so clearly deployed in the published version\nof the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen paper (1935), but Einstein did not\nwrite that paper and did not like the way the argument appeared there.\nSeparability is, however, an explicit premise in all of Einstein’s\nlater presentations of the argument for the incompleteness of quantum\nmechanics, both in correspondence and in print (see Howard 1985 for a\ndetailed list of references). \nIn brief, the argument is this. Separability implies that spacelike\nseparated systems have associated with them independent real states of\naffairs. A second postulate, locality, implies that the events in one\nregion of spacetime cannot physically influence physical reality in a\nregion of spacetime separated from the first by a spacelike interval.\nConsider now an experiment in which two systems, A and B, interact and\nseparate, subsequent measurements on each corresponding to spacelike\nseparated events. Separability implies that A and B have separate real\nphysical states, and locality implies that the measurement performed\non A cannot influence B’s real physical state. But quantum mechanics\nascribes different theoretical states, different wave functions, to B\ndepending upon that parameter that is measured on A. Therefore,\nquantum mechanics ascribes different theoretical states to B, when B\npossesses, in fact, one real physical state. Hence quantum mechanics\nis incomplete. \nOne wants to ask many questions. First, what notion of completeness is\nbeing invoked here? It is not deductive completeness. It is closer in\nkind to what is termed “categoricity” in formal semantics,\na categorical theory being one whose models are all isomorphic to one\nanother. It is closer still to the principle discussed above—and\ncited as a precursor of the concept of categoricity—namely, the\nprinciple of univocalness, which we found doing such important work in\nEinstein’s quest for a general theory of relativity, where it was the\npremise forcing the adoption of an invariant and thus univocal scheme\nfor the individuation of spacetime manifold points. \nThe next question is why separability is viewed by Einstein as\nvirtually an a priori necessary condition for the possibility of a\nscience of physics. One reason is because a field theory like general\nrelativity, which was Einstein’s model for a future unified foundation\nfor physics, is an extreme embodiment of the principle of\nseparability: “Field theory has carried out this principle to\nthe extreme, in that it localizes within infinitely small\n(four-dimensional) space-elements the elementary things existing\nindependently of the one another that it takes as basic, as well as\nthe elementary laws it postulates for them” (Einstein 1948,\n321–322). And a field theory like general relativity can do this\nbecause the infinitesimal metric interval—the careful way to\nthink about separation in general relativistic spacetime—is\ninvariant (hence univocally determined) under all continuous\ncoordinate transformations. \nAnother reason why Einstein would be inclined to view separability as\nan a priori necessity is that, in thus invoking separability to ground\nindividuation, Einstein places himself in a tradition of so viewing\nspatial separability with very strong Kantian roots (and, before Kant,\nNewtonian roots), a tradition in which spatial separability was known\nby the name that Arthur Schopenhauer famously gave to it, the\nprincipium individuationis (for a fuller discussion of this\nhistorical context, see Howard 1997). \nA final question one wants to ask is: “What does any of this\nhave to do with realism?” One might grant Einstein’s point that\na real ontology requires a principle of individuation without agreeing\nthat separability provides the only conceivable such principle.\nSeparability together with the invariance of the infinitesimal metric\ninterval implies that, in a general relativistic spacetime, there are\njoints everywhere, meaning that we can carve up the universe in any\nway we choose and still have ontically independent parts. But quantum\nentanglement can be read as implying that this libertarian scheme of\nindividuation does not work. Can quantum mechanics not be given a\nrealistic interpretation? Many would say, “yes.” Einstein\nsaid, “no.”  \nThere is much that is original in Einstein’s philosophy of science as\ndescribed thus far. At the very least, he rearranged the bits and\npieces of doctrine that he learned from others—Kant, Mach,\nDuhem, Poincaré, Schlick, and others—in a strikingly\nnovel way. But Einstein’s most original contribution to\ntwentieth-century philosophy of science lies elsewhere, in his\ndistinction between what he termed “principle theories”\nand “constructive theories.” \nThis idea first found its way into print in a brief 1919 article in\nthe Times of London (Einstein 1919). A constructive theory,\nas the name implies, provides a constructive model for the phenomena\nof interest. An example would be kinetic theory. A principle theory\nconsists of a set of individually well-confirmed, high-level empirical\ngeneralizations, “which permit of precise formulation”\n(Einstein 1914, 749). Examples include the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics. Ultimate understanding requires a constructive theory,\nbut often, says Einstein, progress in theory is impeded by premature\nattempts at developing constructive theories in the absence of\nsufficient constraints by means of which to narrow the range of\npossible constructive theories. It is the function of principle\ntheories to provide such constraint, and progress is often best\nachieved by focusing first on the establishment of such principles.\nAccording to Einstein, that is how he achieved his breakthrough with\nthe theory of relativity, which, he says, is a principle theory, its\ntwo principles being the relativity principle and the light\nprinciple. \nWhile the principle theories-constructive theories distinction first\nmade its way into print in 1919, there is considerable evidence that\nit played an explicit role in Einstein’s thinking much earlier\n(Einstein 1907, Einstein to Sommerfeld 14 January 1908, CPAE, vol. 5,\nDoc. 73, Einstein 1914). Nor was it only the relativity and light\nprinciples that served Einstein as constraints in his theorizing.\nThus, he explicitly mentions also the Boltzmann principle, \\(S = k\n\\log W\\), as another such: \nEinstein is here alluding the famous entropic analogy whereby, in his\n1905 photon hypothesis paper, he reasoned from the fact that black\nbody radiation in the Wien regime satisfied the Boltzmann principle to\nthe conclusion that, in that regime, radiation behaved as if it\nconsisted of mutually independent, corpuscle-like quanta of\nelectromagnetic energy. The quantum hypothesis is a constructive model\nof radiation; the Boltzmann principle is the constraint that first\nsuggested that model. \nThere are anticipations of the principle theories-constructive\ntheories distinction in the nineteenth-century electrodynamics\nliterature, James Clerk Maxwell, in particular, being a source from\nwhich Einstein might well have drawn (see Harman 1998). At the turn of\nthe century, the “physics of principles” was a subject\nunder wide discussion. At the turn of 1900, Hendrik A. Lorentz\n(Lorentz 1900, 1905; see Frisch 2005) and Henri Poincaré (for\nexample, Poincaré 1904; see, Giedymin 1982, Darrigol 1995)\npresented the opposition between the “physics of\nprinciples“ and the “physics of models“ as\ncommonplace. In a similar vein, Arnold Sommerfeld opposed a\n“physics of problems“, a style of doing physics based on\nconcrete puzzle solving, to the “practice of principles“\ndefended by Max Planck (Seth 2010). Philipp Frank (1908, relying on\nRey 1909) defined relativity theory as a “ conceptual\ntheory“ based on abstract, but empirically well confirmed\nprinciples rather than on intuitive models. Probably many other\nexamples could be find. . But however extensive his borrowings (no\nexplicit debt was ever acknowledged), in Einstein’s hands the\ndistinction becomes a methodological tool of impressive scope and\nfertility. What is puzzling, and even a bit sad, is that this most\noriginal methodological insight of Einstein’s had comparatively little\nimpact on later philosophy of science or practice in physics. Only in\nrecent decades, Einstein constructive-principle distinction has\nattracted interest in the philosophical literature, originating a\nstill living philosophical debate on the foundation of spacetime\ntheories (Brown 2005, Janssen 2009, Lange\n 2014).[4] \nEinstein’s influence on twentieth-century philosophy of science is\ncomparable to his influence on twentieth-century physics (Howard\n2014). What made that possible? One explanation looks to the\ninstitutional and disciplinary history of theoretical physics and the\nphilosophy of science. Each was, in its own domain, a new mode of\nthought in the latter nineteenth century, and each finally began to\nsecure for itself a solid institutional basis in the early twentieth\ncentury. In a curious way, the two movements helped one another.\nPhilosophers of science helped to legitimate theoretical physics by\nlocating the significant cognitive content of science in its theories.\nTheoretical physicists helped to legitimate the philosophy of science\nby providing for analysis a subject matter that was radically\nreshaping our understanding of nature and the place of humankind\nwithin it. In some cases the help was even more direct, as with the\nwork of Einstein and Max Planck in the mid-1920s to create in the\nphysics department at the University of Berlin a chair in the\nphilosophy of science for Reichenbach (see Hecht and Hartmann 1982).\nAnd we should remember the example of the physicists Mach and Ludwig\nBoltzmann who were the first two occupants of the new chair for the\nphilosophy of science at the University of Vienna at the turn of the\ncentury. \nAnother explanation looks to the education of young physicists in\nEinstein’s day. Not only was Einstein’s own youthful reading heavily\nfocused on philosophy, more generally, and the philosophy of science,\nin particular (for an overview, see Einstein 1989, xxiv–xxv; see\nalso Howard 1994b), in which respect he was not unlike other\nphysicists of his generation, but also his university physics\ncurriculum included a required course on “The Theory of\nScientific Thought” (see Einstein 1987, Doc. 28). An obvious\nquestion is whether or not the early cultivation of a philosophical\nhabit of mind made a difference in the way Einstein and his\ncontemporaries approached physics. As indicated by his November 1944\nletter to Robert Thorton quoted at the beginning of this article,\nEinstein thought that it did.
