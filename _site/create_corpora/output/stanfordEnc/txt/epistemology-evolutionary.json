In the first role, selection is the generator and maintainer of\nthe reliability of our senses and cognitive mechanisms, as well as the\n“fit” between those mechanisms and the world. In the\nsecond role, trial and error learning and the evolution of scientific\ntheories are construed as selection processes.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional epistemology has its roots in Plato and the ancient\nskeptics. One strand emerges from Plato’s interest in the problem of\ndistinguishing between knowledge and true belief. His solution was to\nsuggest that knowledge differs from true belief in being justified.\nAncient skeptics complained that all attempts to provide any such\njustification were hopelessly flawed. Another strand emerges from the\nattempt to provide a reconstruction of human knowledge showing how the\npieces of human knowledge fit together in a structure of mutual\nsupport. This project got its modern stamp from Descartes and comes in\nempiricist as well as rationalist versions which in turn can be given\neither a foundational or coherentist twist. The two strands are woven\ntogether by a common theme. The bonds that hold the reconstruction of\nhuman knowledge together are the justificational and evidential\nrelations which enable us to distinguish knowledge from true belief.  \n\nThe traditional approach is predicated on the assumption that\nepistemological questions have to be answered in ways which do not\npresuppose any particular knowledge. The argument is that any such\nappeal would obviously be question begging. Such approaches may be\nappropriately labeled “transcendental.” \n\nThe Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century suggested an\nalternative approach first explored by Dewey and the pragmatists. Human\nbeings, as the products of evolutionary development, are natural\nbeings. Their capacities for knowledge and belief are also the products\nof a natural evolutionary development. As such, there is some reason to\nsuspect that knowing, as a natural activity, could and should be\ntreated and analyzed along lines compatible with its status, i.e., by\nthe methods of natural science. On this view, there is no sharp\ndivision of labor between science and epistemology. In particular, the\nresults of particular sciences such as evolutionary biology and\npsychology are not ruled a priori irrelevant to the solution\nof epistemological problems. Such approaches, in general, are called\nnaturalistic epistemologies, whether they are directly motivated by\nevolutionary considerations or not. Those which are directly motivated\nby evolutionary considerations and which argue that the growth of\nknowledge follows the pattern of evolution in biology are called\n“evolutionary epistemologies.” \n\nEvolutionary epistemology is the attempt to address questions in the\ntheory of knowledge from an evolutionary point of view. Evolutionary\nepistemology involves, in part, deploying models and metaphors drawn\nfrom evolutionary biology in the attempt to characterize and resolve\nissues arising in epistemology and conceptual change. As disciplines\nco-evolve, models are traded back and forth. Thus, evolutionary\nepistemology also involves attempts to understand how biological\nevolution proceeds by interpreting it through models drawn from our\nunderstanding of conceptual change and the development of theories. The\nterm “evolutionary epistemology” was coined by Donald Campbell\n(1974). \n\nThere are two interrelated but distinct programs which go by the name\n“evolutionary epistemology.” One focuses on the development of\ncognitive mechanisms in animals and humans. This involves a\nstraightforward extension of the biological theory of evolution to\nthose aspects or traits of animals which are the biological substrates\nof cognitive activity, e.g., their brains, sensory systems, motor\nsystems, etc. The other program attempts to account for the evolution\nof ideas, scientific theories, epistemic norms and culture in general\nby using models and metaphors drawn from evolutionary biology. Both\nprograms have their roots in 19th century biology and social\nphilosophy, in the work of Darwin, Spencer, James and others. There\nhave been a number of attempts in the intervening years to develop the\nprograms in detail (see Campbell 1974, Bradie 1986, Cziko 1995). Much\nof the contemporary work in evolutionary epistemology derives from the\nwork of Konrad Lorenz (1977), Donald Campbell (1974a, et al.), Karl\nPopper (1972, 1984) and Stephen Toulmin (1967, 1972).  \n\nThe two programs have been labeled EEM and EET (Bradie, 1986). EEM is\nthe label for the program which attempts to provide an evolutionary\naccount of the development of cognitive structures. EET is the label\nfor the program which attempts to analyze the development of human\nknowledge and epistemological norms by appealing to relevant\nbiological considerations. Some of these attempts involve analyzing\nthe growth of human knowledge in terms of selectionist models and\nmetaphors (e.g., Popper 1972, Toulmin 1972, Hull 1988; see Renzi and\nNapolitano 2011 for a critique of these efforts). Others argue for a\nbiological grounding of epistemological norms and methodologies but\neschew\nselectionist models of the growth of human knowledge as such\n(e.g., Ruse 1986, Rescher 1990). \n\nThe EEM and EET programs are interconnected but distinct. A\nsuccessful EEM selectionist explanation of the development of cognitive\nbrain structures provides no warrant, in itself, for extrapolating such\nmodels to understand the development of human knowledge systems.\nSimilarly, endorsing an EET selectionist account of how human knowledge\nsystems grow does not, in itself, warrant concluding that specific or\ngeneral brain structures involved in cognition are the result of\nnatural selection for enhanced cognitive capacities. The two programs,\nthough similar in design and drawing upon the same models and\nmetaphors, do not stand or fall together. \n\nBiological development involves both ontogenetic and phylogenetic\nconsiderations. Thus, the development of specific traits, such as the\nopposable thumb in humans, can be viewed both from the point of view of\nthe development of that trait in individual organisms (ontogeny) and\nthe development of that trait in the human lineage (phylogeny). The\ndevelopment of knowledge and knowing mechanisms exhibits a parallel\ndistinction. We can consider the growth of an individual’s corpus of\nknowledge and epistemological norms or of an individual’s brain (ontogeny), or\nthe growth of human knowledge and establishment of epistemological\nnorms across generations or the development of brains in the human\nlineage (phylogeny). The EEM/EET distinction cuts across this\ndistinction since we may be concerned either with the ontogenetic or\nphylogenetic development of, e.g., the brain or the ontogenetic or\nphylogenetic development of norms and knowledge corpora. One might\nexpect that since current orthodoxy maintains that biological processes\nof ontogenesis proceed differently from the selectionist processes of\nphylogenesis, evolutionary epistemologies would reflect this\ndifference. Curiously enough, however, for the most part they do not.\nFor example, the theory of “neural Darwinism” as put forth by Edelman\n(1987) and Changeaux (1985) offers a selectionist account of the\nontogenetic development of the neural structures of the brain. Karl\nPopper’s conjectures and refutations model of the development of human\nknowledge is a well known example of a selectionist account which has\nbeen applied both to the ontogenetic growth of knowledge in individuals\nas well as the trans-generational (phylogenetic) evolution of\nscientific knowledge. B. F. Skinner’s theory of operant conditioning,\nwhich deals with the ontogenesis of individual behavior, is explicitly\nbased upon the Darwinian selectionist model (Skinner 1981). \n\nA third distinction concerns descriptive versus prescriptive approaches\nto epistemology and the growth of human knowledge. Traditionally,\nepistemology has been construed as a normative project whose aim is to\nclarify and defend conceptions of knowledge, foundations, evidential\nwarrant and justification. Many have argued that neither the EEM\nprograms nor the EET programs have anything at all to do with\nepistemology properly (i.e., traditionally) understood. The basis for\nthis contention is that epistemology, properly understood, is a\nnormative discipline, whereas the EEM and EET programs are concerned\nwith the construction of causal and genetic (i.e., descriptive) models\nof the evolution of cognitive capacities or knowledge systems. No such\nmodels, it is alleged, can have anything important to contribute to\nnormative epistemology (e.g., Kim 1988). The force of this complaint\ndepends upon how one construes the relationship between evolutionary\nepistemology and the tradition.  \n\nThere are three possible configurations of the relationship between\ndescriptive and traditional epistemologies. (1) Descriptive\nepistemologies can be construed as competitors to traditional normative\nepistemologies. On this view, both are trying to address the same\nconcerns and offering competing solutions. Riedl (1984) defends this\nposition. A standard objection to such approaches is that descriptive\naccounts are not adequate to do justice to the prescriptive elements of\nnormative methodologies. The extent to which an evolutionary approach\ncontributes to the resolution of traditional epistemological and\nphilosophical problems is a function of which approach one adopts (cf.\nDretske 1971, Bradie 1986, Ruse 1986, Radnitsky and Bartley 1987, Kim\n1988). (2) Descriptive epistemology might be seen as a successor\ndiscipline to traditional epistemology. On this reading, descriptive\nepistemology does not address the questions of traditional epistemology\nbecause it deems them irrelevant or unanswerable or uninteresting. Many\ndefenders of naturalized epistemologies fall into this camp (e.g., Munz\n1993). (3) Descriptive epistemology might be seen as complementary to\ntraditional epistemology. This appears to be Campbell’s view. On this\nanalysis, the function of the evolutionary approach is to provide a\ndescriptive account of knowing mechanisms while leaving the\nprescriptive aspects of epistemology to more traditional approaches. At\nbest, the evolutionary analyses serve to rule out normative approaches\nwhich are either implausible or inconsistent with an evolutionary\norigin of human understanding. \n\nEEM programs are saddled with the typical uncertainties of\nphylogenetic reconstructions. Is this or that organ or structure an\nadaptation and if so, for what? In addition, there are the\nuncertainties which result from the necessarily sparse fossil record\nof brain and sensory organ development. The EET programs are even more\nproblematic. While it is plausible enough to think that the\nevolutionary imprint on our organs of thought influences what and how\nwe do think, it is not at all clear that the influence is direct,\nsignificant or detectible. Selectionist epistemologies which endorse a\n“trial and error” methodology as an appropriate model for\nunderstanding scientific change are not analytic consequences of\naccepting that the brain and other ancillary organs are adaptations\nwhich have evolved primarily under the influence of natural\nselection. The viability of such selectionist models is an empirical\nquestion which rests on the development of adequate\nmodels. Hull’s (1988) is, as he himself admits, but the first\nstep in that direction. Cziko (1995) is a manifesto urging the\ndevelopment of such models (cf. also the evolutionary game theory\nmodeling approach of Harms 1997). Much hard empirical work needs to\nbe done to sustain this line of research. Non-selectionist\nevolutionary epistemologies, along the lines of Ruse (1986), face a\ndifferent range of difficulties. It remains to be shown that any\nbiological considerations are sufficiently restrictive to narrow down\nthe range of potential methodologies in any meaningful way. A\nnon-selectionist approach to evolutionary epistemology, based on\n“Poincaréan dynamics,” has been proposed by Barham\n(1990). An alternative approach, which exploits the fact that\norganisms and their environments co-evole as a result of dialectical\ninteractions between them, has led to the development of\n“non-adaptational” evolutionary epistemologies (Gontier et\nal 2006). A critical review of the problems facing the development of\nthe naturalistic turn in evolutionary epistemology can be found in\nCallebaut and Stotz (1998). \n\nNevertheless, the emergence in the latter quarter of the twentieth\ncentury of serious efforts to provide an evolutionary account of human\nunderstanding has potentially radical consequences. The application of\nselectionist models to the development of human knowledge, for example,\ncreates an immediate tension. Standard traditional accounts of the\nemergence and growth of scientific knowledge see science as a\nprogressive enterprise which, under the appropriate conditions of\nrational and free inquiry, generates a body of knowledge which\nprogressively converges on the truth. Selectionist models of biological\nevolution, on the other hand, are generally construed to be\nnon-progressive or, at most, locally so. Rather than generating\nconvergence, biological evolution produces diversity. Popper’s\nevolutionary epistemology attempts to embrace both but does so\nuneasily. Kuhn’s “scientific revolutions” account draws tentatively\nupon a Darwinian model, but when criticized, Kuhn retreated (cf. Kuhn\n1972, pp. 172f with Lakatos and Musgrave 1970, p. 264). Toulmin (1972) is\na noteworthy exception. On his account, concepts of rationality are\npurely “local” and are themselves subject to evolution. This, in turn,\nseems to entail the need to abandon any sense of “goal directedness” in\nscientific inquiry. This is a radical consequence which few have\nembraced. Pursuing an evolutionary approach to epistemology raises\nfundamental questions about the concepts of knowledge, truth, realism,\njustification and rationality. \n\nAlthough Campbell and Popper both pointed to the continuity between\nthe evolution of human knowledge and the evolution of knowledge in\nnon-human organisms, much of the early work in evolutionary\nepistemology focused on the human condition. However, recent empirical\ninvestigations by psychologists, cognitive ethologists, cognitive\nneuroscientists and animal behaviorists have revealed that animals,\nboth primates and non-primates, have much more sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities than were previously suspected (Panksepp 1998, Heyes and\nHuber 2000, Rogers and Kaplan 2004, Lurz 2011, van Schaik 2010). From an evolutionary perspective\nthis is not surprising given the shared evolutionary heritage that all\nanimals share. Taking Darwin seriously means reconsidering and\nreassessing the nature of human knowledge in the light of our\nincreased awareness of the cogntive capabilities of the members of\nother species. In addition, once a firm empirical basis of the scope\nand limits of animal cognitive capacities has been established we will\nbe in a position to reassess our philosophical evaluations of the\nmental lives of animals and their epistemic and moral status as\nwell. Further field research promises to revolutionize our\nunderstanding of the sense in which human beings are one among the\nanimals. \n\nThe KLI Theory Lab of the Konrad Lorenz Institute publishes a journal\ndevoted to issues in evolutionary epistemology in addition to other\napplications of biological theory, \n Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution and Cognition. \n\nEvery scientific enterprise requires formal and semi-formal models\nwhich allow the quantitative characterization of its objects of study.\nThe attempt to transform the philosophical study of knowledge into a\nscientific discipline which approaches knowledge as a biological\nphenomenon is no different. Much of the evolutionary epistemology\nliterature has been concerned with how to conceive of knowledge as a\nnatural phenomenon, what difference this would make to our\nunderstanding of our place in the world, and with answering objections\nto the project. There are, as well, a number of more technical projects\nwhich attempt to provide the theoretical tools necessary for a\nnaturalistic epistemology.  \n\nIn the simplest sort of model, an organism has to deal with an\nenvironment that has two states, \\(S_1\\) and\n\\(S_2\\), and has two possible responses\n\\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\). We suppose that what\nthe organism does in each state makes a difference to its fitness.\nFitnesses are usually written characterized by a matrix \\(W\\).  \n\nThe individual elements of the matrix \\(W_{ij}\\) are the fitness\nconsequences of response \\(i\\) in state \\(j\\).  So, for instance,\n\\(W_{21}\\) denotes the fitness consequences of \\(R_2\\) in \\(S_1\\). If\nwe let \\(W_{11}\\) and \\(W_{22}\\) equal one and \\(W_{12}\\) and\n\\(W_{21}\\) equal zero, then there is a clear evolutionary advantage to\nperforming \\(R_1\\) in \\(S_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in \\(S_2\\). \n\nHowever, the organism must first detect the state of the environment,\nand detectors are not in general perfectly reliable. If the organism\nresponds automatically to the detector, we can use the probabilities\nof responses given states to characterize the reliability of the\ndetector. We write the probability of \\(R_1\\) given \\(S_1\\) as\n\\(\\Pr(R_1 \\mid S_1)\\). This allows us to calculate that responding to the\ndetector rather than always choosing \\(R_1\\) or \\(R_2\\) will be\nadvantageous just in case the following inequality holds\n(cf. Godfrey-Smith 1996): \n\nThis simple model demonstrates that whether or not flexible responses\nare adaptive depends on the particular characteristics of the fitness\ndifferences that the responses make, the probability of the various\nstates of the environment, and the reliability of the detector. The\nparticular result is calculated assuming that detecting the\nenvironmental state and the flexible response system is free in\nevolutionary terms. More complete analyses would include the costs of\nthese factors. \n\nStatic optimization models like the one outlined above can be extended\nin several ways. Most obviously, the number of environmental states\nand organismic responses can be increased, but there are other\nmodifications that are more interesting. Signal detection theory, for\ninstance, models the detectors and cues in more detail. In one\nexample, a species of “sea moss” detects the presence of\npredatory sea slugs via a chemical cue. They respond by growing\nspines, which is costly. The cue in this case, the water-borne\nchemical, comes in a variety of concentrations, which indicate various\nlevels of danger. Signal detection theory allows us to calculate the\nbest threshold value of the detector for the growing of\nspines.  \n\nStatic models depict evolutionary processes in terms of fitness\ncosts and benefits. They are static in the sense that they model no\nactual process, but merely calculate the direction of change for\ndifferent situations. If fitness is high, a type will increase, if low\nit will decrease. When fitnesses are equal, population proportions\nremain at stable equilibrium. Dynamic models typically employ the kinds\nof calculations involved in static models to depict actual change over\ntime in population proportions. Instead of calculating whether change\nwill occur and in what direction, dynamic models follow change. \n\nPopulation dynamics, sometimes referred to as “replicator dynamics”,\noffers a tractable way to model the evolution of populations over time\nunder the kinds of selective pressures that can be characterized by\nstatic optimization models. This is often necessary, since the dynamics\nof such populations are often difficult to predict purely on the basis\nof static considerations of payoff differences. The so-called\n“replicator dynamics” were named by Taylor and Jonker (1978) and\ngeneralized by Schuster and Sigmund (1983) and Hofbauer and Sigmund\n(1988). They trace their source back to the seminal work of R.A. Fisher\nin the 1920s and 30s. The generalization covers evolutionary models\nused in population genetics, evolutionary game theory, ecology, and the\nstudy of prebiotic evolution. The models can be implemented either\nmathematically or computationally, and can model either stepwise\n(discrete) or continuous evolutionary change.  \n\nPopulation dynamics models the evolution of populations. A population\nis a collection of individuals, which are categorized according to\ntype. The types in genetics are genes, in evolutionary game theory,\nstrategies. The types of interest in epistemological models would be\ntypes of cognitive apparatuses, or cognitive strategies — ways\nof responding to environmental cues, ways of manipulating\nrepresentations, and so forth. Roughly, EEM models focus on the\ninherited and EET models focus on the learned. The evolution of the\npopulation consists in changes of the relative frequency of the\ndifferent types within the population. Selection, typified by\ndifferential reproductive success, is represented as follows. Each\ntype has a growth rate or “fitness”, designated by \\(w\\),\nand a frequency designated by \\(p\\). The frequency of type \\(i\\) at\nthe next generation \\(p'_i\\) is simply the old frequency multiplied by\nthe fitness and divided by the mean fitness of the population\n“\\(\\overline{w}\\)”. \n\nDivision by \\(\\overline{w}\\) has the effect of\n“normalizing” the frequencies, so that they add up to one\nafter each is multiplied by its fitness. It also makes evident that\nthe frequency of a type will increase just in case its fitness is\nhigher than the current population average.  \n\nFitnesses, which should be understood simply as the aggregation of\nprobable-growth factors that drive the dynamics of large populations,\nmay depend on a variety of factors. Fitness components differ from\nvariation components in that they affect population frequencies\nproportionally to those frequencies, that is to say, multiplicatively.\nFitness components in biological evolution include mortality and\nreproductive rate. In cultural evolution, they include transmission\nprobability and rejection probability. Within either sort of model,\nwhat matters is how fitnesses change as a result of other changing\nfactors within the model. In the simplest cases, fitnesses are fixed\nand the type with the highest fitness inevitably dominates the\npopulation. In more complex cases, fitnesses may depend on variable\nfactors like who one plays against, or the state of a variable\nenvironment. Most commonly, variable fitnesses are calculated using a\npayoff matrix like the one above. In general, to calculate the expected\nfitness of a type, one multiplies the fitness a type would have in each\nsituation times the likelihood that individuals in the population will\nconfront that situation and adds the resulting products.  \n\nwhere \\(W_{iA}\\) is type \\(i\\)’s fitness in situation\n\\(A\\). This sort of calculation assumes that the effects of the\nvarious situations are additive. More complex situations can be\nmodeled, of course, but additive matrices are the standard. It should\nbe noted, however, that matrix-driven evolution can exhibit quite\ncomplex behavior. For instance, chaotic behavior is possible with as\nfew as four strategies (Skyrms 1992). \n\nSome relationships may be represented without a matrix. Boyd and\nRicherson (1985), for instance, were interested in a special kind of\nfrequency dependent transmission bias in culture, where being common\nconferred an advantage due to imitators “doing as the Romans do.” In\nsuch a case, the operative fitness of the type is just the fitness as\ncalculated according to the usual factors, and then modified as a\nfunction of the frequency of the type. \n\nThe conceptual bases of replicator dynamics are quite straightforward.\nGetting results typically requires one of two approaches. In order to\nprove more than rudimentary mathematical results, one typically needs\nto derive a continuous version of the dynamics. The basic form is  \n\nwith fitnesses calculated as usual. Mathematical approaches have been\nquite productive, though the bulk of theoretical results apply\nprimarily to population genetics. See Hofbauer and Sigmund (1988) for a\ncompendium of such results, as well as a reasonable graduate-level\nintroduction to the mathematical study of evolutionary processes.  \n\nThe second approach is computational. With the increase in power of\npersonal computers, computational implementation of evolutionary models\nbecome increasingly attractive. They require only rudimentary\nprogramming skills, and are in general much more flexible in the\nassumptions they require. The general strategy is to create an array to\nhold population frequencies and fitnesses, and then a series of\nprocedures (or methods or functions) which \n\nA loop then runs the routines in sequence, over and over again. Most\nmodelers are happy to put their source code on the internet, which is\nprobably the best place to find it.  \n\nPart of the difficulty in understanding cognitive behavior as the\nproduct of evolution is that there are at least three very different\nevolutionary processes involved. First, there is the biological\nevolution of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms via genetic\ninheritance. Second, there is the cultural evolution of languages and\nconcepts. Third, there is the trial-and-error learning process that\noccurs during an individual’s lifetime. Moreover, there is some reason\nto agree with Donald T. Campbell that understanding human knowledge\nfully will require understanding the interaction between these\nprocesses. This requires that we be able to model both processes of\nbiological and cultural evolution. There are by now a number of\nwell-established models of biological evolution. Cultural evolution\npresents more novelty.  \n\nPerhaps the most popular attempt to understand cultural evolution is\nRichard Dawkins’ (1976) invention of the “meme.” Dawkins observed that\nwhat lies at the heart of biological evolution is differential\nreproduction. Evolution in general was then the competitive dynamics of\nlineages of self-replicating entities. If culture was to evolve, on\nthis view, there had to be cultural “replicators”, or entities whose\ndifferential replication in culture constituted the cultural\nevolutionary process. Dawkins dubbed these entities “memes”, and they\nwere characterized as informational entities which infect our brains,\n“leaping from head to head” via what we ordinarily call imitation.\nCommon examples include infectious tunes, and religious ideologies. The\nmain difficulty with this approach has been the problem of how to provide\nspecifications for the basic entities. The identity conditions of genes\ncan be given, in theory, in terms of sequences of base pairs in\nchromosomes. There appears to be no such fundamental “alphabet” for the\nitems of cultural transmission. Consequently, the project of “memetics”\nas a contending basis for evolutionary epistemology is on hold pending an\nadequate understanding of its basic ontology. The online\n Journal of Memetics contains some early papers on memetics.\nAlthough the journal has ceased publication, the existing papers are still accessible online. See Atran (2001) and Sperber (2001) for reservations about the viability of memetic models of cultural evolution. For a recent defense of this approach, see Dennett (2017). \n\nPopulation models have been used to good effect in modeling cultural\ntransmission processes. Evolutionary game theory models are frequently\nclaimed to cover both processes in which strategies are inherited and\nthose in which they are imitated. This application is possible in the\nabsence of any specification of the underlying nature of strategies,\nfor instance, whether they are to be thought of as\n“things” which are replicated, or whether they are\nproperties or states of the individuals whose strategies they\nare. This is sometimes referred to as the “epidemiological\napproach”, though again, the comparison to infection is due to\nthe quantitative tools used in analysis rather than to any\npresupposition regarding the underlying ontology of cultural\ntransmission (Sperber 1996, Sperber and Hirschfield 2004). \n\nSome recent work focuses on the capacities of organisms to modify their environments in ways that affect the selection pressures that they face. In classical models of organism-environment interactions, organisms adapted to their environments by “fiting” into pre-existing niches. Richard Lewontin’s dialectical model of organism-environment interactions emphasized the extent to which organisms “construct” niches rather than merely accommodating themselves to those already present in the environment (Lewontin 1982). There is now a large body of literature on niche construction (see inter alia Laland et al 2000 and Odling-Smee et al 2003) The application of this idea to issues in evolutionary epistemology takes the form of appeals to cultural niches and cognitive niches. Cultural niches are created by the capacity of organisms, in general, to the extent that having culture can be attributed to them, and human beings, in particular, to learn from one another and from the constructed cultural modifications of their environments. For human beings, such constructions take the forms of, among others, language, educational institutions, communication systems and other forms of information manipulation and transfer. Cognitive niches are created by the capacities for constructing mental models of the environment that, in turn, enable organisms, especially human beings, during the course of their lifetimes to systematically and efficiently exploit the resources of their environments (Pinter 2003, 2010; Whiten and Erdal 2012, Whiten and van Schaik 2007, Laland and O’Brien 2011) \n\nThe kind of levels involved in evolutionary epistemology are quite\ndifferent than the kind of levels of selection which are discussed\nmuch more often in the “levels of selection” debate in\nevolutionary biology. In evolutionary biology, the\n“levels” of selection under discussion are levels of\nscale. The debate concerns whether genes are always the\n“units” or “targets” of selection, or whether\nselection can occur on higher levels, like organisms, groups, and\nspecies. The levels involved in evolutionary epistemology, on the\nother hand, are levels of the regulatory hierarchy involved in the\ncontrol of behavior. These include the genetic bases of cognitive and\nperceptual hardware, concepts, languages, techniques, beliefs,\npreferences, and so forth. Note that in the case of evolutionary\nepistemology, the terms “levels” and\n“hierarchy” may be impressionistic. There is often no\nclear arrangement of levels at all.  \n\nThere are at least two different approaches that have been taken to\nmodeling multi-level evolution. \n\nFull descriptive accounts of truth and justification both demand a\ntheory of meaning. Until a sign has meaning, it cannot be true or\nfalse. Moreover, determining the meaning of justificatory claims may\nprovide a descriptive theory of justification. Presumably, what makes a\nclaim of justification true is the basis of that justification. If\nmeaning is conventional, then the evolution of meaning becomes an\ninstance of the evolution of conventions.  \n\nModels of the evolution of conventions have in one case been extended\nto apply to meaning conventions. Skyrms (1996, chapter 5) gave an\nevolutionary interpretation of  David Lewis’ (1969) model of\nrational selection of meaning conventions. Skyrms was able to show\nthat there is strong selection on the formation of “signaling\nsystems” in mixed populations with a full set of coordinated,\ncountercoordinated, and uncoordinated strategies. It is significant\nthat the structure of the model and the selective process by which\nmeaning conventions emerge and are stabilized largely parallels the\naccount of the evolution of meaning given by Ruth Millikan (1984). \n\nIn the simplest version, the model is constructed as follows: We\nimagine that there are two states of affairs \\(T\\), two acts \\(A\\),\nand two signals \\(M\\). Players have an equal chance of being in either\nthe position of sender, or receiver. Receivers must decide what to do\nbased purely on what the sender tells them. In this purely cooperative\nversion, each player gets one point if the receiver does \\(A_1\\) if\nthe state is \\(T_1\\) or \\(A_2\\) if the state is \\(T_2\\). \n\nSince players will be both sender and receiver, they must have a\nstrategy for each situation. There are sixteen such strategies, and we\nsuppose them to be either inherited (or learned) from biological\nparents, or imitated on the basis of perceived success in terms of\npoints earned. Strategies \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) are signaling systems,\nin that if both players play the same one of these two strategies they\nwill always get their payoff. \\(I_3\\) and \\(I_4\\) are anti-signaling\nstrategies, which result in consistent miscoordination, though they do\nwell against each other. All of the other strategies involve \\(S_3,\nS_4, R_3\\), or \\(R_4\\), which results in the same act being performed\nno matter what the external state is. \n\nSimulation results showed that virtually all initial population\ndistributions become dominated by one or the other of the two signaling\nsystem strategies. The situation becomes more complex when more\nrealistic payoffs are introduced, for instance, that the sender incurs\na cost rather than automatically sharing the benefit that the receiver\ngets from correct behavior for the environment. Even in such\nsituations, however, the most likely course of evolution is domination\nby a signaling system.

In the first role, selection is the generator and maintainer of\nthe reliability of our senses and cognitive mechanisms, as well as the\n“fit” between those mechanisms and the world. In the\nsecond role, trial and error learning and the evolution of scientific\ntheories are construed as selection processes.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional epistemology has its roots in Plato and the ancient\nskeptics. One strand emerges from Plato’s interest in the problem of\ndistinguishing between knowledge and true belief. His solution was to\nsuggest that knowledge differs from true belief in being justified.\nAncient skeptics complained that all attempts to provide any such\njustification were hopelessly flawed. Another strand emerges from the\nattempt to provide a reconstruction of human knowledge showing how the\npieces of human knowledge fit together in a structure of mutual\nsupport. This project got its modern stamp from Descartes and comes in\nempiricist as well as rationalist versions which in turn can be given\neither a foundational or coherentist twist. The two strands are woven\ntogether by a common theme. The bonds that hold the reconstruction of\nhuman knowledge together are the justificational and evidential\nrelations which enable us to distinguish knowledge from true belief.  \n\nThe traditional approach is predicated on the assumption that\nepistemological questions have to be answered in ways which do not\npresuppose any particular knowledge. The argument is that any such\nappeal would obviously be question begging. Such approaches may be\nappropriately labeled “transcendental.” \n\nThe Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century suggested an\nalternative approach first explored by Dewey and the pragmatists. Human\nbeings, as the products of evolutionary development, are natural\nbeings. Their capacities for knowledge and belief are also the products\nof a natural evolutionary development. As such, there is some reason to\nsuspect that knowing, as a natural activity, could and should be\ntreated and analyzed along lines compatible with its status, i.e., by\nthe methods of natural science. On this view, there is no sharp\ndivision of labor between science and epistemology. In particular, the\nresults of particular sciences such as evolutionary biology and\npsychology are not ruled a priori irrelevant to the solution\nof epistemological problems. Such approaches, in general, are called\nnaturalistic epistemologies, whether they are directly motivated by\nevolutionary considerations or not. Those which are directly motivated\nby evolutionary considerations and which argue that the growth of\nknowledge follows the pattern of evolution in biology are called\n“evolutionary epistemologies.” \n\nEvolutionary epistemology is the attempt to address questions in the\ntheory of knowledge from an evolutionary point of view. Evolutionary\nepistemology involves, in part, deploying models and metaphors drawn\nfrom evolutionary biology in the attempt to characterize and resolve\nissues arising in epistemology and conceptual change. As disciplines\nco-evolve, models are traded back and forth. Thus, evolutionary\nepistemology also involves attempts to understand how biological\nevolution proceeds by interpreting it through models drawn from our\nunderstanding of conceptual change and the development of theories. The\nterm “evolutionary epistemology” was coined by Donald Campbell\n(1974). \n\nThere are two interrelated but distinct programs which go by the name\n“evolutionary epistemology.” One focuses on the development of\ncognitive mechanisms in animals and humans. This involves a\nstraightforward extension of the biological theory of evolution to\nthose aspects or traits of animals which are the biological substrates\nof cognitive activity, e.g., their brains, sensory systems, motor\nsystems, etc. The other program attempts to account for the evolution\nof ideas, scientific theories, epistemic norms and culture in general\nby using models and metaphors drawn from evolutionary biology. Both\nprograms have their roots in 19th century biology and social\nphilosophy, in the work of Darwin, Spencer, James and others. There\nhave been a number of attempts in the intervening years to develop the\nprograms in detail (see Campbell 1974, Bradie 1986, Cziko 1995). Much\nof the contemporary work in evolutionary epistemology derives from the\nwork of Konrad Lorenz (1977), Donald Campbell (1974a, et al.), Karl\nPopper (1972, 1984) and Stephen Toulmin (1967, 1972).  \n\nThe two programs have been labeled EEM and EET (Bradie, 1986). EEM is\nthe label for the program which attempts to provide an evolutionary\naccount of the development of cognitive structures. EET is the label\nfor the program which attempts to analyze the development of human\nknowledge and epistemological norms by appealing to relevant\nbiological considerations. Some of these attempts involve analyzing\nthe growth of human knowledge in terms of selectionist models and\nmetaphors (e.g., Popper 1972, Toulmin 1972, Hull 1988; see Renzi and\nNapolitano 2011 for a critique of these efforts). Others argue for a\nbiological grounding of epistemological norms and methodologies but\neschew\nselectionist models of the growth of human knowledge as such\n(e.g., Ruse 1986, Rescher 1990). \n\nThe EEM and EET programs are interconnected but distinct. A\nsuccessful EEM selectionist explanation of the development of cognitive\nbrain structures provides no warrant, in itself, for extrapolating such\nmodels to understand the development of human knowledge systems.\nSimilarly, endorsing an EET selectionist account of how human knowledge\nsystems grow does not, in itself, warrant concluding that specific or\ngeneral brain structures involved in cognition are the result of\nnatural selection for enhanced cognitive capacities. The two programs,\nthough similar in design and drawing upon the same models and\nmetaphors, do not stand or fall together. \n\nBiological development involves both ontogenetic and phylogenetic\nconsiderations. Thus, the development of specific traits, such as the\nopposable thumb in humans, can be viewed both from the point of view of\nthe development of that trait in individual organisms (ontogeny) and\nthe development of that trait in the human lineage (phylogeny). The\ndevelopment of knowledge and knowing mechanisms exhibits a parallel\ndistinction. We can consider the growth of an individual’s corpus of\nknowledge and epistemological norms or of an individual’s brain (ontogeny), or\nthe growth of human knowledge and establishment of epistemological\nnorms across generations or the development of brains in the human\nlineage (phylogeny). The EEM/EET distinction cuts across this\ndistinction since we may be concerned either with the ontogenetic or\nphylogenetic development of, e.g., the brain or the ontogenetic or\nphylogenetic development of norms and knowledge corpora. One might\nexpect that since current orthodoxy maintains that biological processes\nof ontogenesis proceed differently from the selectionist processes of\nphylogenesis, evolutionary epistemologies would reflect this\ndifference. Curiously enough, however, for the most part they do not.\nFor example, the theory of “neural Darwinism” as put forth by Edelman\n(1987) and Changeaux (1985) offers a selectionist account of the\nontogenetic development of the neural structures of the brain. Karl\nPopper’s conjectures and refutations model of the development of human\nknowledge is a well known example of a selectionist account which has\nbeen applied both to the ontogenetic growth of knowledge in individuals\nas well as the trans-generational (phylogenetic) evolution of\nscientific knowledge. B. F. Skinner’s theory of operant conditioning,\nwhich deals with the ontogenesis of individual behavior, is explicitly\nbased upon the Darwinian selectionist model (Skinner 1981). \n\nA third distinction concerns descriptive versus prescriptive approaches\nto epistemology and the growth of human knowledge. Traditionally,\nepistemology has been construed as a normative project whose aim is to\nclarify and defend conceptions of knowledge, foundations, evidential\nwarrant and justification. Many have argued that neither the EEM\nprograms nor the EET programs have anything at all to do with\nepistemology properly (i.e., traditionally) understood. The basis for\nthis contention is that epistemology, properly understood, is a\nnormative discipline, whereas the EEM and EET programs are concerned\nwith the construction of causal and genetic (i.e., descriptive) models\nof the evolution of cognitive capacities or knowledge systems. No such\nmodels, it is alleged, can have anything important to contribute to\nnormative epistemology (e.g., Kim 1988). The force of this complaint\ndepends upon how one construes the relationship between evolutionary\nepistemology and the tradition.  \n\nThere are three possible configurations of the relationship between\ndescriptive and traditional epistemologies. (1) Descriptive\nepistemologies can be construed as competitors to traditional normative\nepistemologies. On this view, both are trying to address the same\nconcerns and offering competing solutions. Riedl (1984) defends this\nposition. A standard objection to such approaches is that descriptive\naccounts are not adequate to do justice to the prescriptive elements of\nnormative methodologies. The extent to which an evolutionary approach\ncontributes to the resolution of traditional epistemological and\nphilosophical problems is a function of which approach one adopts (cf.\nDretske 1971, Bradie 1986, Ruse 1986, Radnitsky and Bartley 1987, Kim\n1988). (2) Descriptive epistemology might be seen as a successor\ndiscipline to traditional epistemology. On this reading, descriptive\nepistemology does not address the questions of traditional epistemology\nbecause it deems them irrelevant or unanswerable or uninteresting. Many\ndefenders of naturalized epistemologies fall into this camp (e.g., Munz\n1993). (3) Descriptive epistemology might be seen as complementary to\ntraditional epistemology. This appears to be Campbell’s view. On this\nanalysis, the function of the evolutionary approach is to provide a\ndescriptive account of knowing mechanisms while leaving the\nprescriptive aspects of epistemology to more traditional approaches. At\nbest, the evolutionary analyses serve to rule out normative approaches\nwhich are either implausible or inconsistent with an evolutionary\norigin of human understanding. \n\nEEM programs are saddled with the typical uncertainties of\nphylogenetic reconstructions. Is this or that organ or structure an\nadaptation and if so, for what? In addition, there are the\nuncertainties which result from the necessarily sparse fossil record\nof brain and sensory organ development. The EET programs are even more\nproblematic. While it is plausible enough to think that the\nevolutionary imprint on our organs of thought influences what and how\nwe do think, it is not at all clear that the influence is direct,\nsignificant or detectible. Selectionist epistemologies which endorse a\n“trial and error” methodology as an appropriate model for\nunderstanding scientific change are not analytic consequences of\naccepting that the brain and other ancillary organs are adaptations\nwhich have evolved primarily under the influence of natural\nselection. The viability of such selectionist models is an empirical\nquestion which rests on the development of adequate\nmodels. Hull’s (1988) is, as he himself admits, but the first\nstep in that direction. Cziko (1995) is a manifesto urging the\ndevelopment of such models (cf. also the evolutionary game theory\nmodeling approach of Harms 1997). Much hard empirical work needs to\nbe done to sustain this line of research. Non-selectionist\nevolutionary epistemologies, along the lines of Ruse (1986), face a\ndifferent range of difficulties. It remains to be shown that any\nbiological considerations are sufficiently restrictive to narrow down\nthe range of potential methodologies in any meaningful way. A\nnon-selectionist approach to evolutionary epistemology, based on\n“Poincaréan dynamics,” has been proposed by Barham\n(1990). An alternative approach, which exploits the fact that\norganisms and their environments co-evole as a result of dialectical\ninteractions between them, has led to the development of\n“non-adaptational” evolutionary epistemologies (Gontier et\nal 2006). A critical review of the problems facing the development of\nthe naturalistic turn in evolutionary epistemology can be found in\nCallebaut and Stotz (1998). \n\nNevertheless, the emergence in the latter quarter of the twentieth\ncentury of serious efforts to provide an evolutionary account of human\nunderstanding has potentially radical consequences. The application of\nselectionist models to the development of human knowledge, for example,\ncreates an immediate tension. Standard traditional accounts of the\nemergence and growth of scientific knowledge see science as a\nprogressive enterprise which, under the appropriate conditions of\nrational and free inquiry, generates a body of knowledge which\nprogressively converges on the truth. Selectionist models of biological\nevolution, on the other hand, are generally construed to be\nnon-progressive or, at most, locally so. Rather than generating\nconvergence, biological evolution produces diversity. Popper’s\nevolutionary epistemology attempts to embrace both but does so\nuneasily. Kuhn’s “scientific revolutions” account draws tentatively\nupon a Darwinian model, but when criticized, Kuhn retreated (cf. Kuhn\n1972, pp. 172f with Lakatos and Musgrave 1970, p. 264). Toulmin (1972) is\na noteworthy exception. On his account, concepts of rationality are\npurely “local” and are themselves subject to evolution. This, in turn,\nseems to entail the need to abandon any sense of “goal directedness” in\nscientific inquiry. This is a radical consequence which few have\nembraced. Pursuing an evolutionary approach to epistemology raises\nfundamental questions about the concepts of knowledge, truth, realism,\njustification and rationality. \n\nAlthough Campbell and Popper both pointed to the continuity between\nthe evolution of human knowledge and the evolution of knowledge in\nnon-human organisms, much of the early work in evolutionary\nepistemology focused on the human condition. However, recent empirical\ninvestigations by psychologists, cognitive ethologists, cognitive\nneuroscientists and animal behaviorists have revealed that animals,\nboth primates and non-primates, have much more sophisticated cognitive\ncapacities than were previously suspected (Panksepp 1998, Heyes and\nHuber 2000, Rogers and Kaplan 2004, Lurz 2011, van Schaik 2010). From an evolutionary perspective\nthis is not surprising given the shared evolutionary heritage that all\nanimals share. Taking Darwin seriously means reconsidering and\nreassessing the nature of human knowledge in the light of our\nincreased awareness of the cogntive capabilities of the members of\nother species. In addition, once a firm empirical basis of the scope\nand limits of animal cognitive capacities has been established we will\nbe in a position to reassess our philosophical evaluations of the\nmental lives of animals and their epistemic and moral status as\nwell. Further field research promises to revolutionize our\nunderstanding of the sense in which human beings are one among the\nanimals. \n\nThe KLI Theory Lab of the Konrad Lorenz Institute publishes a journal\ndevoted to issues in evolutionary epistemology in addition to other\napplications of biological theory, \n Biological Theory: Integrating Development, Evolution and Cognition. \n\nEvery scientific enterprise requires formal and semi-formal models\nwhich allow the quantitative characterization of its objects of study.\nThe attempt to transform the philosophical study of knowledge into a\nscientific discipline which approaches knowledge as a biological\nphenomenon is no different. Much of the evolutionary epistemology\nliterature has been concerned with how to conceive of knowledge as a\nnatural phenomenon, what difference this would make to our\nunderstanding of our place in the world, and with answering objections\nto the project. There are, as well, a number of more technical projects\nwhich attempt to provide the theoretical tools necessary for a\nnaturalistic epistemology.  \n\nIn the simplest sort of model, an organism has to deal with an\nenvironment that has two states, \\(S_1\\) and\n\\(S_2\\), and has two possible responses\n\\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\). We suppose that what\nthe organism does in each state makes a difference to its fitness.\nFitnesses are usually written characterized by a matrix \\(W\\).  \n\nThe individual elements of the matrix \\(W_{ij}\\) are the fitness\nconsequences of response \\(i\\) in state \\(j\\).  So, for instance,\n\\(W_{21}\\) denotes the fitness consequences of \\(R_2\\) in \\(S_1\\). If\nwe let \\(W_{11}\\) and \\(W_{22}\\) equal one and \\(W_{12}\\) and\n\\(W_{21}\\) equal zero, then there is a clear evolutionary advantage to\nperforming \\(R_1\\) in \\(S_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) in \\(S_2\\). \n\nHowever, the organism must first detect the state of the environment,\nand detectors are not in general perfectly reliable. If the organism\nresponds automatically to the detector, we can use the probabilities\nof responses given states to characterize the reliability of the\ndetector. We write the probability of \\(R_1\\) given \\(S_1\\) as\n\\(\\Pr(R_1 \\mid S_1)\\). This allows us to calculate that responding to the\ndetector rather than always choosing \\(R_1\\) or \\(R_2\\) will be\nadvantageous just in case the following inequality holds\n(cf. Godfrey-Smith 1996): \n\nThis simple model demonstrates that whether or not flexible responses\nare adaptive depends on the particular characteristics of the fitness\ndifferences that the responses make, the probability of the various\nstates of the environment, and the reliability of the detector. The\nparticular result is calculated assuming that detecting the\nenvironmental state and the flexible response system is free in\nevolutionary terms. More complete analyses would include the costs of\nthese factors. \n\nStatic optimization models like the one outlined above can be extended\nin several ways. Most obviously, the number of environmental states\nand organismic responses can be increased, but there are other\nmodifications that are more interesting. Signal detection theory, for\ninstance, models the detectors and cues in more detail. In one\nexample, a species of “sea moss” detects the presence of\npredatory sea slugs via a chemical cue. They respond by growing\nspines, which is costly. The cue in this case, the water-borne\nchemical, comes in a variety of concentrations, which indicate various\nlevels of danger. Signal detection theory allows us to calculate the\nbest threshold value of the detector for the growing of\nspines.  \n\nStatic models depict evolutionary processes in terms of fitness\ncosts and benefits. They are static in the sense that they model no\nactual process, but merely calculate the direction of change for\ndifferent situations. If fitness is high, a type will increase, if low\nit will decrease. When fitnesses are equal, population proportions\nremain at stable equilibrium. Dynamic models typically employ the kinds\nof calculations involved in static models to depict actual change over\ntime in population proportions. Instead of calculating whether change\nwill occur and in what direction, dynamic models follow change. \n\nPopulation dynamics, sometimes referred to as “replicator dynamics”,\noffers a tractable way to model the evolution of populations over time\nunder the kinds of selective pressures that can be characterized by\nstatic optimization models. This is often necessary, since the dynamics\nof such populations are often difficult to predict purely on the basis\nof static considerations of payoff differences. The so-called\n“replicator dynamics” were named by Taylor and Jonker (1978) and\ngeneralized by Schuster and Sigmund (1983) and Hofbauer and Sigmund\n(1988). They trace their source back to the seminal work of R.A. Fisher\nin the 1920s and 30s. The generalization covers evolutionary models\nused in population genetics, evolutionary game theory, ecology, and the\nstudy of prebiotic evolution. The models can be implemented either\nmathematically or computationally, and can model either stepwise\n(discrete) or continuous evolutionary change.  \n\nPopulation dynamics models the evolution of populations. A population\nis a collection of individuals, which are categorized according to\ntype. The types in genetics are genes, in evolutionary game theory,\nstrategies. The types of interest in epistemological models would be\ntypes of cognitive apparatuses, or cognitive strategies — ways\nof responding to environmental cues, ways of manipulating\nrepresentations, and so forth. Roughly, EEM models focus on the\ninherited and EET models focus on the learned. The evolution of the\npopulation consists in changes of the relative frequency of the\ndifferent types within the population. Selection, typified by\ndifferential reproductive success, is represented as follows. Each\ntype has a growth rate or “fitness”, designated by \\(w\\),\nand a frequency designated by \\(p\\). The frequency of type \\(i\\) at\nthe next generation \\(p'_i\\) is simply the old frequency multiplied by\nthe fitness and divided by the mean fitness of the population\n“\\(\\overline{w}\\)”. \n\nDivision by \\(\\overline{w}\\) has the effect of\n“normalizing” the frequencies, so that they add up to one\nafter each is multiplied by its fitness. It also makes evident that\nthe frequency of a type will increase just in case its fitness is\nhigher than the current population average.  \n\nFitnesses, which should be understood simply as the aggregation of\nprobable-growth factors that drive the dynamics of large populations,\nmay depend on a variety of factors. Fitness components differ from\nvariation components in that they affect population frequencies\nproportionally to those frequencies, that is to say, multiplicatively.\nFitness components in biological evolution include mortality and\nreproductive rate. In cultural evolution, they include transmission\nprobability and rejection probability. Within either sort of model,\nwhat matters is how fitnesses change as a result of other changing\nfactors within the model. In the simplest cases, fitnesses are fixed\nand the type with the highest fitness inevitably dominates the\npopulation. In more complex cases, fitnesses may depend on variable\nfactors like who one plays against, or the state of a variable\nenvironment. Most commonly, variable fitnesses are calculated using a\npayoff matrix like the one above. In general, to calculate the expected\nfitness of a type, one multiplies the fitness a type would have in each\nsituation times the likelihood that individuals in the population will\nconfront that situation and adds the resulting products.  \n\nwhere \\(W_{iA}\\) is type \\(i\\)’s fitness in situation\n\\(A\\). This sort of calculation assumes that the effects of the\nvarious situations are additive. More complex situations can be\nmodeled, of course, but additive matrices are the standard. It should\nbe noted, however, that matrix-driven evolution can exhibit quite\ncomplex behavior. For instance, chaotic behavior is possible with as\nfew as four strategies (Skyrms 1992). \n\nSome relationships may be represented without a matrix. Boyd and\nRicherson (1985), for instance, were interested in a special kind of\nfrequency dependent transmission bias in culture, where being common\nconferred an advantage due to imitators “doing as the Romans do.” In\nsuch a case, the operative fitness of the type is just the fitness as\ncalculated according to the usual factors, and then modified as a\nfunction of the frequency of the type. \n\nThe conceptual bases of replicator dynamics are quite straightforward.\nGetting results typically requires one of two approaches. In order to\nprove more than rudimentary mathematical results, one typically needs\nto derive a continuous version of the dynamics. The basic form is  \n\nwith fitnesses calculated as usual. Mathematical approaches have been\nquite productive, though the bulk of theoretical results apply\nprimarily to population genetics. See Hofbauer and Sigmund (1988) for a\ncompendium of such results, as well as a reasonable graduate-level\nintroduction to the mathematical study of evolutionary processes.  \n\nThe second approach is computational. With the increase in power of\npersonal computers, computational implementation of evolutionary models\nbecome increasingly attractive. They require only rudimentary\nprogramming skills, and are in general much more flexible in the\nassumptions they require. The general strategy is to create an array to\nhold population frequencies and fitnesses, and then a series of\nprocedures (or methods or functions) which \n\nA loop then runs the routines in sequence, over and over again. Most\nmodelers are happy to put their source code on the internet, which is\nprobably the best place to find it.  \n\nPart of the difficulty in understanding cognitive behavior as the\nproduct of evolution is that there are at least three very different\nevolutionary processes involved. First, there is the biological\nevolution of cognitive and perceptual mechanisms via genetic\ninheritance. Second, there is the cultural evolution of languages and\nconcepts. Third, there is the trial-and-error learning process that\noccurs during an individual’s lifetime. Moreover, there is some reason\nto agree with Donald T. Campbell that understanding human knowledge\nfully will require understanding the interaction between these\nprocesses. This requires that we be able to model both processes of\nbiological and cultural evolution. There are by now a number of\nwell-established models of biological evolution. Cultural evolution\npresents more novelty.  \n\nPerhaps the most popular attempt to understand cultural evolution is\nRichard Dawkins’ (1976) invention of the “meme.” Dawkins observed that\nwhat lies at the heart of biological evolution is differential\nreproduction. Evolution in general was then the competitive dynamics of\nlineages of self-replicating entities. If culture was to evolve, on\nthis view, there had to be cultural “replicators”, or entities whose\ndifferential replication in culture constituted the cultural\nevolutionary process. Dawkins dubbed these entities “memes”, and they\nwere characterized as informational entities which infect our brains,\n“leaping from head to head” via what we ordinarily call imitation.\nCommon examples include infectious tunes, and religious ideologies. The\nmain difficulty with this approach has been the problem of how to provide\nspecifications for the basic entities. The identity conditions of genes\ncan be given, in theory, in terms of sequences of base pairs in\nchromosomes. There appears to be no such fundamental “alphabet” for the\nitems of cultural transmission. Consequently, the project of “memetics”\nas a contending basis for evolutionary epistemology is on hold pending an\nadequate understanding of its basic ontology. The online\n Journal of Memetics contains some early papers on memetics.\nAlthough the journal has ceased publication, the existing papers are still accessible online. See Atran (2001) and Sperber (2001) for reservations about the viability of memetic models of cultural evolution. For a recent defense of this approach, see Dennett (2017). \n\nPopulation models have been used to good effect in modeling cultural\ntransmission processes. Evolutionary game theory models are frequently\nclaimed to cover both processes in which strategies are inherited and\nthose in which they are imitated. This application is possible in the\nabsence of any specification of the underlying nature of strategies,\nfor instance, whether they are to be thought of as\n“things” which are replicated, or whether they are\nproperties or states of the individuals whose strategies they\nare. This is sometimes referred to as the “epidemiological\napproach”, though again, the comparison to infection is due to\nthe quantitative tools used in analysis rather than to any\npresupposition regarding the underlying ontology of cultural\ntransmission (Sperber 1996, Sperber and Hirschfield 2004). \n\nSome recent work focuses on the capacities of organisms to modify their environments in ways that affect the selection pressures that they face. In classical models of organism-environment interactions, organisms adapted to their environments by “fiting” into pre-existing niches. Richard Lewontin’s dialectical model of organism-environment interactions emphasized the extent to which organisms “construct” niches rather than merely accommodating themselves to those already present in the environment (Lewontin 1982). There is now a large body of literature on niche construction (see inter alia Laland et al 2000 and Odling-Smee et al 2003) The application of this idea to issues in evolutionary epistemology takes the form of appeals to cultural niches and cognitive niches. Cultural niches are created by the capacity of organisms, in general, to the extent that having culture can be attributed to them, and human beings, in particular, to learn from one another and from the constructed cultural modifications of their environments. For human beings, such constructions take the forms of, among others, language, educational institutions, communication systems and other forms of information manipulation and transfer. Cognitive niches are created by the capacities for constructing mental models of the environment that, in turn, enable organisms, especially human beings, during the course of their lifetimes to systematically and efficiently exploit the resources of their environments (Pinter 2003, 2010; Whiten and Erdal 2012, Whiten and van Schaik 2007, Laland and O’Brien 2011) \n\nThe kind of levels involved in evolutionary epistemology are quite\ndifferent than the kind of levels of selection which are discussed\nmuch more often in the “levels of selection” debate in\nevolutionary biology. In evolutionary biology, the\n“levels” of selection under discussion are levels of\nscale. The debate concerns whether genes are always the\n“units” or “targets” of selection, or whether\nselection can occur on higher levels, like organisms, groups, and\nspecies. The levels involved in evolutionary epistemology, on the\nother hand, are levels of the regulatory hierarchy involved in the\ncontrol of behavior. These include the genetic bases of cognitive and\nperceptual hardware, concepts, languages, techniques, beliefs,\npreferences, and so forth. Note that in the case of evolutionary\nepistemology, the terms “levels” and\n“hierarchy” may be impressionistic. There is often no\nclear arrangement of levels at all.  \n\nThere are at least two different approaches that have been taken to\nmodeling multi-level evolution. \n\nFull descriptive accounts of truth and justification both demand a\ntheory of meaning. Until a sign has meaning, it cannot be true or\nfalse. Moreover, determining the meaning of justificatory claims may\nprovide a descriptive theory of justification. Presumably, what makes a\nclaim of justification true is the basis of that justification. If\nmeaning is conventional, then the evolution of meaning becomes an\ninstance of the evolution of conventions.  \n\nModels of the evolution of conventions have in one case been extended\nto apply to meaning conventions. Skyrms (1996, chapter 5) gave an\nevolutionary interpretation of  David Lewis’ (1969) model of\nrational selection of meaning conventions. Skyrms was able to show\nthat there is strong selection on the formation of “signaling\nsystems” in mixed populations with a full set of coordinated,\ncountercoordinated, and uncoordinated strategies. It is significant\nthat the structure of the model and the selective process by which\nmeaning conventions emerge and are stabilized largely parallels the\naccount of the evolution of meaning given by Ruth Millikan (1984). \n\nIn the simplest version, the model is constructed as follows: We\nimagine that there are two states of affairs \\(T\\), two acts \\(A\\),\nand two signals \\(M\\). Players have an equal chance of being in either\nthe position of sender, or receiver. Receivers must decide what to do\nbased purely on what the sender tells them. In this purely cooperative\nversion, each player gets one point if the receiver does \\(A_1\\) if\nthe state is \\(T_1\\) or \\(A_2\\) if the state is \\(T_2\\). \n\nSince players will be both sender and receiver, they must have a\nstrategy for each situation. There are sixteen such strategies, and we\nsuppose them to be either inherited (or learned) from biological\nparents, or imitated on the basis of perceived success in terms of\npoints earned. Strategies \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) are signaling systems,\nin that if both players play the same one of these two strategies they\nwill always get their payoff. \\(I_3\\) and \\(I_4\\) are anti-signaling\nstrategies, which result in consistent miscoordination, though they do\nwell against each other. All of the other strategies involve \\(S_3,\nS_4, R_3\\), or \\(R_4\\), which results in the same act being performed\nno matter what the external state is. \n\nSimulation results showed that virtually all initial population\ndistributions become dominated by one or the other of the two signaling\nsystem strategies. The situation becomes more complex when more\nrealistic payoffs are introduced, for instance, that the sender incurs\na cost rather than automatically sharing the benefit that the receiver\ngets from correct behavior for the environment. Even in such\nsituations, however, the most likely course of evolution is domination\nby a signaling system. ","contact.mail":"wharms@uw.edu","contact.domain":"uw.edu"}]
