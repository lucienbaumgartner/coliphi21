In religious literature, there is a\nlong history of expressions of annoyance, anxiety, and despair over\ndivine hiddenness, so understood. For example, ancient Hebrew texts\nlament God’s failure to show up in experience or to show proper\nregard for God’s people or some particular person, and two\nChristian Gospels portray Jesus, in his cry of dereliction on the\ncross, as experiencing abandonment by God, whom he regarded as\n“Abba, Father”, an experience shared by many mystics,\nsaints, and ordinary folk of all theistic traditions, described at its\nworst as “the dark night of the soul”. Understood in this\nway, divine hiddenness poses an existential problem for those who have\nsuch experiences.\n\n\nHowever, “divine hiddenness” refers to something else in\nrecent philosophical literature, especially since the publication of\nJ.L. Schellenberg’s landmark book, Divine Hiddenness and\nHuman Reason (1993). In this context, it refers to alleged facts\nabout the absence of belief of God, on the basis of which one might\nthink there is no God. For example, Schellenberg argues that, since\nthere are nonbelievers who are capable of a personal relationship with\nGod and who do not resist it, there is no perfectly loving God, while\nStephen Maitzen argues that naturalism better explains the\n“demographics” of nonbelief than theism and Jason Marsh\nargues that naturalism better explains “natural nonbelief”\nthan theism. Understood in this way, divine hiddenness constitutes\nputative evidence for atheism.\n\n\nAlthough some of the recent philosophical literature addresses the\nproblem understood in the first way (e.g., DeWeese-Boyd 2016; Garcia\n2002), this entry focuses on divine hiddenness understood in the\nsecond way. The first section discusses the relationships between\nnonbelief and another source of alleged evidence for atheism: evil.\nThe second section states and defends the argument from nonresistant\nnonbelief. The third section sketches attempts to explain nonresistant\nnonbelief from a theistic perspective. The fourth section states other\nresponses to the argument from nonresistant nonbelief. The fifth\nsection discusses the argument from the demographics of nonbelief and\nthe sixth section discusses the argument from natural nonbelief.\n\n\nSeveral relationships between nonbelief and evil appear when we view\nthem as providing evidence for atheism. \n(A) It is customary to distinguish “logical”\n(“deductive”) arguments from evil from\n“evidential” (“inductive”,\n“abductive”, “probabilistic”) arguments from\nevil. There are different ways to draw that distinction. On one way\n(Howard-Snyder 1996c), a logical argument from evil affirms of some\nknown fact about evil that it is incompatible with theism (e.g.,\nMackie 1955; Schellenberg 2007a), while an evidential argument from\nevil does not—either because it affirms that the fact in\nquestion, although incompatible with theism, is not known but only\nreasonably believed to be the case (e.g., Rowe 1979), or because it affirms that\nthe fact in question, though known, is more surprising on theism than\non some competing hypothesis (e.g., Draper 1989; Oppy 2013). Likewise\nfor nonbelief. A logical argument from nonbelief affirms of some known\nfact about nonbelief that it is incompatible with the existence of God\n(Drange 1998), while an evidential argument from nonbelief does\nnot—either because it affirms that the fact in question,\nalthough incompatible with theism, is not known but only reasonably\nbelieved (Schellenberg 1993, 2015), or because it affirms that the\nfact in question, though known, is more surprising on theism than on\nsome competing hypothesis (Maitzen 2006; Marsh 2013). \n(B) It is a matter of dispute whether nonbelief provides evidence for\natheism independently of evil. Those in favor of independence invite\nus to imagine a world with no pain, suffering, or moral\nvice/wrongdoing. No one in such a world would appeal to evil as\nevidence for atheism, but someone might appeal to nonbelief as\nevidence for atheism (van Inwagen 2002, 2008; Schellenberg 2010a). Those in favor of\ndependence tend to define “evil” more broadly. For\nexample, they might say that evils are just bad states of affairs,\nwhether pain, suffering, or moral vice/wrongdoing, on the one hand, or\nnonbelief, on the other hand (Kvanvig 2002). Alternatively, they might\nargue in an Augustinian spirit that, since evil just is a lack of a\ngood that should exist, and since belief of God is a good that should\nexist, nonbelief is an evil. \n(C) Even if nonbelief provides evidence for atheism independently of\nevil, critical responses to arguments from nonbelief and evil share\nimportant similarities. For example, just as some critics try to\nexplain why God permits evil, so some critics try to explain why God\npermits nonbelief. Moreover, just as some critics argue that we are in\nno position to say that there are no unknown reasons for God to permit\nevil, so some critics argue that we are in no position to say that\nthere are no unknown reasons for God to permit nonbelief. Furthermore,\njust as some critics deny the relevant facts about evil, so some\ncritics deny the relevant facts about nonbelief. In addition, just as\nsome people say evil provides evidence against theism only if we\nconceive of God in certain ways, and so we should conceive of God\ndifferently, so some people say that nonbelief provides evidence\nagainst theism only if we conceive of God in certain ways, and so we\nshould conceive of God differently. Finally, just as some people grant\nthat evil gives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things\ngive theism much more weight, so some people grant that nonbelief\ngives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things give theism\nmuch more weight. \n(D) We can see another connection between arguments from evil and\nnonbelief by way of one of William Rowe’s evidential arguments\nfrom evil. Obviously enough, there is horrific suffering in the world;\nbut, says Rowe, God exists only if there is a reason for God to permit\nsuch suffering. However, since there is no reason that we know of,\nit’s reasonable to infer that there is no reason, period (Rowe\n1979). Thus, it’s\nreasonable to infer that God does not exist. Some critics question the\nreasonableness of Rowe’s inference from “there is no\nreason we know of” to “there is no reason, period”,\non the grounds that it assumes that we are in a good position to tell\nwhether there is a reason, an assumption they regard as dubious since\nit would not be the least bit surprising if there were a reason that\nwas accessible to God but not to us. These critics are too quick,\nhowever. For we must distinguish two ways in which we might be in a\ngood position to tell whether something exists. The first way is\ndirect: we are in a position to see or mentally apprehend it for\nourselves. The second way is indirect: although we are not in a good\nposition to see or mentally apprehend it for ourselves, we are in a\ngood position to see or apprehend something else and, seeing or\napprehending that other thing, we are in a good position to infer\nreasonably that the first thing exists. The critics are too quick\nbecause they ignore the second, indirect way in which we might be in a\ngood position to tell whether something exists. This is where\nnonbelief might come into play. For one might argue that if\nGod’s reasons for permitting a person to undergo horrific\nsuffering were inaccessible to them, then God would make it clear to\nthem that there is such a reason through clear assurances of\nGod’s love and care, clear enough so that they are in a good\nposition to believe that God has a reason to permit their suffering.\nBut many people who suffer do not believe that God has a reason to\npermit their suffering, not least because they do not believe that God\nexists. So it is that nonbelief arguably vindicates Rowe’s\nassumption and inference (Bergmann 2001; Howard-Snyder 1992, 1996b;\nRowe 2001; Trakakis 2007b). \n(E) An additional connection between evil and nonbelief consists in\ntrying to use various theistically friendly explanations of the facts\nabout evil to address concerns regarding the facts about nonbelief\nand, conversely, trying to use various theistically friendly\nexplanations of the facts about nonbelief to address concerns\nregarding the facts about evil. For example, one might argue that just\nas deep responsibility for each other’s wellbeing explains\nGod’s permission of some sin and suffering, so it explains\nGod’s permission of some nonbelief (Swinburne 1998). Or, alternatively, if there\nis a good reason for God to permit nonbelief, then God also has good\nreason not to intervene systematically to prevent or undo the\nconsequences of wrongdoing (for if God did so intervene, God’s\nexistence would be clear enough to prevent nonbelief), and so God has\nsome reason to permit some of the suffering that is a natural\nconsequence of wrongdoing (Dumsday 2015c). \n(F) Just as we must distinguish evil providing an argumentative basis\nfor atheism from evil providing a non-argumentative basis for atheism,\nso we must distinguish nonbelief providing an argumentative basis for\natheism from nonbelief providing a non-argumentative basis for\natheism. In the case of evil, this might work by\n“seeing right there in the evil that the world was\nGodless or that the evil was so repugnant as to be irredeemable”\n(Gellman 2013: 11). Likewise, in the case of nonbelief, this might\nwork by seeing right there in the nonresistant nonbeliever that the\nworld was Godless or that the nonresistant nonbelief was so repugnant\nas to be divinely impermissible. \n\nMore than anyone else, Schellenberg has shaped the\ncontemporary debate over arguments from nonbelief. The main argument\nfrom his 1993 book can be stated as follows: \nFor the defense of premise (2), Schellenberg’s reasoning\nprovides the following subargument: \n(2d) is tantamount to premise\n (2) of the main argument. \nIn his post-1993 writings, Schellenberg clarifies that he means his\nclaims about God, love, and relationship to be necessary truths.\nMoreover, the main argument of his 2007a replaces talk of\n“culpability” with talk of “resistance”.\n(“I now see this focus on culpability and inculpability as a\nmistake”; 2015: 54.) And he emphasizes “meaningful\nconscious relationship”. Finally, his 2015 and 2016 focuses on\nthe “openness” of “a perfectly loving God” to\n“positively meaningful” and “reciprocal conscious\nrelationship”. Thus, the latest version of the argument\n(slightly condensed): \nSchellenberg argues for premise\n (4)\n on the basis of what he calls ultimism, the proposition that\nthere is a reality that is ultimate in three ways. A\nmetaphysically ultimate reality, he says,  \nis something whose existence is the ultimate or most fundamental fact\nabout the nature of things, in terms of which any other fact about\nwhat things exist and how they exist would have to be explained in a\ncomprehensive and correct account.  \nAn axiologically ultimate reality “embod[ies] the\ndeepest possible value”, and “would have to be the\ngreatest possible reality”. A soteriologically ultimate\nreality is a reality in relation to which “the deepest or\nultimate human good can be attained” (2015: 19–21). The\nidea of a personal reality that is triply ultimate—that\nis, the idea of God in western philosophy, says Schellenberg—is\nthe idea of the greatest possible person; and, all else being\nequal, a person perfect in love would be an “improvement”\nover a person that was not perfect in love (2015: 89–103;\nSchellenberg 2005d). \nAs for premise\n (5),\n suppose God perfectly loves Anna. That love would minimally involve\nbenevolence, caring for Anna’s well-being. But it would also\ninvolve aiming “at relationship—a conscious and reciprocal\nrelationship that is positively meaningful, allowing for a deep\nsharing” between them. Moreover, it would involve valuing that\nrelationship for its own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else. Furthermore, it would never cease, and so God would\nalways value, seek, desire, promote, or preserve personal relationship\nwith Anna, although God would not force himself on her. At the very\nleast, says Schellenberg, all this requires that God will always be\nopen to personal relationship with her (2016:\n17–22). \nThis notion of openness with those who are capable of\nit—that is, with those who possess the cognitive and affective\nproperties required to participate in a personal relationship, which,\nin the case of God,  \nwould involve such things as a capacity to feel the presence of God,\nrecognizing it as such; a capacity to exhibit attitudes of trust,\ngratitude, and obedience to God, and so on (2016: 21n15)  \n—is crucial. Schellenberg writes: \nExpanding on what he means by “resistance of God”,\nSchellenberg tells us that if we think \nOf course, there are many other ways in which one might “shut\nthe door” or “close one’s eyes” and, as a\nresult, lack belief of God. \nAs for\n (6),\n by Schellenberg’s lights, Anna could not even begin to be in a\npositively meaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with God\nunless she believed that God exists. Why? Because \nThe upshot is that, if God is open to being in a positively meaningful\nand reciprocal conscious relationship with Anna, then, at any time\nthat she is capable of such a relationship, Anna will believe that God\nexists—unless she has done something that results in her being\nresistant to such a relationship at that time. \nAlthough Schellenberg emphasizes the point that perfect love seeks\nrelationship for its own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else, there are additional benefits one should bear in mind\nthat may be jeopardized by divine hiddenness. For consider the\nbenefits to Anna if she were in a positively meaningful, explicit,\nreciprocal conscious relationship with God, even if just one that was\ndevelopmentally in its infancy. First, there would be moral benefits,\ne.g., she would be able to draw on the resources of that relationship\nto overcome flaws in her character, and so she would be more likely to\nemulate the self-giving love with which she was loved, and thus more\nlikely to flourish as a finite person. Second, there would be\nexperiential benefits. She would be, e.g., more likely to experience\npeace and joy stemming from her belief that she is properly related to\nher Maker, and security in believing that, ultimately, all shall be\nwell even if she suffers in the meantime; and she would have the\nprofound pleasure of God’s loving presence. As a consequence of\nthese moral and experiential benefits, Anna’s relationships with\nothers would likely improve (Schellenberg 1993: 19ff). \nAs for the empirical\n premise—(7),\n and the earlier\n (1)—Schellenberg\n generalizes from (a) honest seekers of the truth who remain agnostics\nand atheists, including those whose search leads them to convert to\nnontheistic religions, (b) members of cultures that lack the idea of a\npersonal God altogether, e.g., the Chinese in the period from the\nbeginning of their history until the Christian Middle Ages, (c)\nhunter-gatherers prior to recorded history, and (d) those who have\nlost their theistic faith, and who would like nothing more than to\nregain it. Furthermore, Schellenberg appeals to increased secularity,\nespecially in Western cultures: what is the probability that\nall of the hundreds of millions of nonbelievers in the\nsecular West are, at the dawn of their capacity to relate personally\nwith God, resistant? Vanishingly small (2015: 76ff; 2007a: 205, 228ff). \nIt follows from Schellenberg’s premises\n (4)–(6)\n that, necessarily, if God exists, then, for any capable finite person\nS and time t, it is not the case that S is at\nt nonresistantly in a state of nonbelief in relation to the\nproposition that God exists. In short, God’s existence entails\nthere’s never any nonresistant nonbelief. To assess this\nimplication we must assess the premises from which it follows. In this\nsection, we focus on premise\n (5)\n and a particular kind of assessment, something analogous to theodicy\nin the literature on the problem of evil. To help us keep our focus,\nsuppose we grant premises\n (4)\n and\n (6).\n Moreover, since we want to assess premise\n (5)\n from as sympathetic a position as we can, suppose we grant\nSchellenberg’s claim that one is open to a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with another, in a\nmanner consistent with perfect love, only if one never does anything\n(by commission or omission) that would result in the other being\nprevented from participating in that relationship, just by trying.\nGiven these suppositions, we might wonder whether premise\n (5)\n is true since we might wonder whether it is possible that God\nperfectly loves such finite persons as there may be and yet, for at\nleast some of them, God does something (by commission or omission)\nthat results in them lacking belief of God—even though they have\nthe capacity for a positively meaningful and reciprocal conscious\nrelationship with God and they are not in a state of resistance to\nGod. In particular, we might wonder whether there are any\nreasons for a perfectly loving God to do something (by\ncommission or omission) that would result in nonresistant nonbelief in\npersons who are capable of relating personally with God in this\nway. \nThere are many cases of this type to wonder about. Here are two.\nFirst, imagine someone who has always lacked belief and who has always\nlacked the capacity to relate personally with God but who is,\nnonetheless, nonresistant to God. Such a person might be a child who\nis at the dawn of her capacity to relate personally with God. Might\nthere be good enough reason, consistent with perfect love, for God to\ndo something (by commission or omission) that results in her being\nprevented from belief, even as she transitions to being capable of\nrelating personally with God while remaining nonresistant? Second,\nimagine a man who has had the capacity to relate personally with God\nfor some time, and who was once a fulfilled nonresistant believer but\nwho, for one reason or another, is now in a state of resistant\nnonbelief. Many a university student might satisfy this description,\namong others. Might there be good enough reason, consistent with\nperfect love, for God to do something (by commission or omission) that\nresults in that man being prevented from belief of God even as, later\nin life, he transitions back to being nonresistant? \nAffirmative answers to these questions involve reasons for thinking it\nwould be better if they remained nonbelievers, at least for a time,\ndespite their transitions. For example, what if the child never ever\nexercised any influence over whether she was nonresistant to God?\nPerhaps, in that case, it would be better—for her, and for God,\nand for their forthcoming relationship—if she were first to own\nher good disposition toward God through choices in the face of\ncontrary inclinations, so that, among other things, her loving and\nobeying God was of her own accord when she came to believe. Or perhaps\nher non-resistance to God is grounded in improper motives, e.g., fear\nof punishment, a desire for parental approval or social acceptance,\nand the like, and so God gives her the opportunity to change her\nmotives so that, upon coming to believe, her love and obedience are\nmore properly motivated (Howard-Snyder 1996a, 2016). Or perhaps her\nmoral autonomy and freedom would be objectionably reduced if God were\nto bring her to belief at this time (Hick 1966; Murray 2002; Swinburne\n1979). Or perhaps,\ndespite her non-resistance, if she came to belief now instead of\nlater, the passion and intensity of her desire for God would be\nsignificantly less than it otherwise would be. Or perhaps she is disposed, upon\ncoming to believe now, to think she has arrived at a proper\nunderstanding of God, and she would become complacent or relate to God\nat a superficial level. (Kierkegaard 1844: 28-29, 33-35; cf.\nSchellenberg 1993: 160ff). Or perhaps certain intellectual temptations\nwould be lost on her if she were to believe now, and so she would not\nhave the opportunity to respond to them virtuously (Butler 1736: part 2, chapter 6; cf.\nSchellenberg 1993: 168ff). Or perhaps upon coming to believe now, she\nwould be resentful or envious of God’s glory and greatness\n(Dumsday 2012a). Or what if the university student, despite his\nforthcoming return to non-resistance, was disposed to relate to God in\npresumptuous or arrogant ways upon regaining belief, and not with due\ncontrition and humility, both of which are essential to a proper\nrelationship with God? Or what if he was disposed to be significantly\nless apt to recognize the wretchedness of living life on his own,\nwithout God, if he were to regain belief now instead of later? (Pascal 1670, Fragments 234, 378, 427, 446, 449; cf. Schellenberg 1993: 136ff). Or\nwhat if God does not bring him to belief because he is ill-disposed to\nthe sort of moral transformation God intends for him, or he’s\ninto having a relationship with God just for the pleasure and\ntitillation of it? (Dumsday 2014b; Moser 2002, 2008b) Or what if God\ndoes not bring him to belief because, as a general policy, God permits\nsome people in positions like his to continue in nonbelief in order to\nincrease diverse expressions of religious imagination, creativity, and\ndevotion, or in order to increase opportunities for people to pursue\nknowledge of important matters together, even knowledge as important\nas knowledge of God, or in order to promote assisting each other in\nstarting personal relationships with God (Dumsday 2010b; Schellenberg\n1993: 181ff; Swinburne 1998); or because, under present circumstances,\nbringing all non-resistant believers to belief would force the truth\nof theism on the resistant (Dumsday forthcoming-a). And there are\nother explanations offered as well. \nSeveral points have emerged in the literature with respect to\nassessing these reasons or explanations. \nFirst, it’s doubtful that any single one of them offers a total\nexplanation of nonresistant nonbelief. Different kinds of nonresistant\nnonbelievers, given the rest of their psychology, might call for\ndifferent explanations. Moreover, each of these explanations, taken\nalone, might fail to provide a total explanation of any particular\nkind or instance of nonresistant nonbelief, and yet each of them might\nprovide a partial explanation and, taken together with others, add up\nto a total explanation. At least this is a possibility that must not\nbe overlooked. Thus, if we are to reject these explanations, and\nothers that might be proffered, we must claim that they fail,\ncollectively as well as individually, to account for why God might\npermit nonresistant nonbelief. \nSecond, in light of the foregoing point, even if there are some\nnonresistant nonbelievers, it may well be quite difficult to discern\nwhether they possess or fail to possess those motivations, attitudes,\nand dispositions that allegedly explain their nonbelief in a\ntheistically friendly fashion. If the difficulty is severe enough,\nthen it might be that no one—whether theists, atheists,\nagnostics, or what-have-you—is well-positioned to say that there\nare some nonresistant nonbelievers. \nOf course—and this is the third point—we might well argue\nthat these explanations provide no good reason, individually or\ncollectively, for God to permit nonresistant nonbelief. That’s\nbecause the good states of affairs to which they appeal can be\naccommodated within a developing, positively meaningful and reciprocal\nconscious relationship with God, or because the benefits of such a\nrelationship with God exceed the goods to which these explanations\nappeal, or because, more generally, this sort of relationship with God\nis the greatest good and so God wouldn’t pursue lesser goods at\nits expense (Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002a; Schellenberg 1993, 1996,\n2005a, 2005b, 2007a, 2015; McBrayer and Swenson 2012; Trakakis\n2007a). \nFourth, one might worry that the whole enterprise of providing a\ntheistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief is\nmisguided. After all, if God exists, why didn’t God create a\nworld in which there never was or ever will be any nonresistant\nnonbelief? Why would God create or permit resisters and nonbelievers\nin the first place? Surely he could have created persons who never\nresisted and always believed. \nEven if no theistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief\nwe know of completely satisfies us, we might yet wonder about\nSchellenberg’s premise\n (4):\n necessarily, if God exists, then God perfectly loves such finite\npersons as there may be. \nOn the one hand, we might wonder whether, if God exists, God perfectly\nloves anyone, at least as defined by how we understand love.\nIn this connection, some critics have pointed out that many\n“classical theists” affirm a conception of God according\nto which God is transcendent and ineffable, and so beyond all human\ncomprehension, and so neither personal nor non-personal, and so\nneither loving nor non-loving (Rea 2016; Ross 2002; Trakakis 2016). It\nis certainly less than clear what a conscious, reciprocal relationship\nwould look like with the God of apophaticism. Moreover, even if there\nis a personal God, God might be indifferent to finite created persons,\nand so not love them—an implication of some versions of\nDeism. \nOn the other hand, we might wonder whether, even if God is perfect in\nlove, God would perfectly love such finite persons as there may be.\nFor, in light of an idea suggested as worthy of consideration by Hud Hudson in private correspondence,  \nto love perfectly is for one’s love to be in the right\nproportion to the object of one’s love, everything\nconsidered—loving to the degree that matches the degree of\nworthiness to be loved.  \nTherefore, even if God is perfectly loving, it does not follow that\nGod loves such finite persons as there may be since they may have\npolluted themselves, rendered themselves utterly unlovable; “and\nit is, of course, no symptom of a disordered love to fail to love the\nunlovable”. \nOne might also wonder about premise\n (5):\n necessarily, if God perfectly loves such finite persons as there may\nbe, then, for any capable finite person S and time t,\nGod is at t open to being in a positively meaningful and\nreciprocal conscious relationship with S at t. Whether\nthis is true might depend on what sort of love is perfect, whether it\nis more like that of a mother for her child, or a grandparent for her\ndistant descendants, or a benevolent reconstructive surgeon for her\npatient (Cuneo 2013; McGinnis 2016; Rea 2016; Schellenberg 2013). One\nmight argue that premise\n (5)\n is true only if perfect love is like the first, but wonder what\nfollows if it is like the second or third. In this connection, imagine\nthat what it is for God to perfectly love us is for God to provide for\nour greatest good, and suppose that our greatest good consists in our\nbeing virtuous, caring for our environment and other creatures. In\nthat case, it is not at all clear that a personal relationship of the\nsort Schellenberg imagines is necessary. So long as God has made our\nflourishing achievable, that is all that God’s perfect love\nshould lead us to expect. \nSuppose we grant Schellenberg’s understanding of openness to\nrelationship as well as his premise\n (6),\n and suppose we concede that no theistically friendly explanation of\nnonresistant nonbelief we know of is wholly satisfactory, either\nindividually or collectively. Even so, we might wonder whether we\nshould infer that a perfectly loving God would not permit nonresistant\nnonbelief. After all, an open-minded and intellectually humble\ninquirer will want to satisfy her natural curiosity about whether she\nis in a position to tell whether there are any reasons for God to\npermit nonresistant nonbelief that, although inaccessible to her,\nwould be accessible to God. For suppose that she were to discover\nthat, even if there is no good basis for thinking there is a God, and\neven if she does not know of any wholly satisfactory reason for God to\npermit nonresistant nonbelief, she should be in doubt about whether\nshe is in a position to tell whether there are any unknown reasons. In\nthat case, we would expect her open-mindedness and intellectual\nhumility to lead her to refrain from accepting that a perfectly loving\nGod would not permit nonresistant nonbelief and, in refraining from\naccepting this, she would refrain from accepting premise\n (5). \nThis assessment of the argument from nonbelief has its parallel in the\nproblem of evil literature where it is (badly) named “skeptical\ntheism”. It has been explicitly used in relation to the argument\nfrom nonbelief in Howard-Snyder 2016 and McBrayer and Swenson\n2012. For criticism, see\nSchellenberg 2007a, 2016.\nWhether this assessment leads to objectionable skepticism elsewhere is\na matter of ongoing debate. For discussion as it relates to the\nargument from evil, see Dougherty 2014; Dougherty and McBrayer 2014;\nHoward-Snyder 2009; McBrayer 2010; McBrayer and Howard-Snyder 2013;\nand Trakakis 2007b. \nEven if we accept premises\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n we might yet wonder about Schellenberg’s premise\n (6),\n the claim that God’s openness to a personal relationship with\ncapable nonresistant persons entails that such persons will believe\nthat God exists. Schellenberg argues that one cannot even “get\nstarted” in a personal relationship—a conscious,\nreciprocal, positively meaningful relationship—without believing\nthat the other party exists. It seems, however, that we might not only\n“get started” but get a long way into a conscious,\nreciprocal, positively meaningful relationship without belief that the\nother party exists. After all, might not a degree of confidence below\nthe threshold of belief, or acceptance, or imagination-based assent,\nor belief-less assuming, or trust, or even hope suffice? (See Alston\n1996; Audi 2011; Cohen 1992; Howard-Snyder 2013; McKaughan 2013;\nPoston and Dougherty 2007; Schellenberg 2011, 2014.) \nEven if states less than belief do suffice as the cognitive requirement for \"getting started\" in a relationship, however,\nwe might wonder whether they are as good as belief as a cognitive\nfoundation for a personal relationship with God; and, if they are not,\nwe might well question why a perfectly loving God provides less than\nthe best on this score. Furthermore, even if we grant, just for the\nsake of argument, that a perfectly loving God might provide less than\nthe best on this score, we might have just as good a reason for\nthinking that there are nonresistant\nnon-accepters/assenters/assumers/trusters/hopers who are capable of\nrelating personally with God as we do for thinking that there are\nnonresistant nonbelievers in that condition (Schellenberg 2007b,\n2016). \nLast but not least, we might wonder about premise\n (7):\n are there really any nonresistant nonbelievers with a capacity to\nrelate personally with God? According to some critics, everyone at\nleast implicitly believes in God, although not under the name\n“God” or under a description they might recognize as\nbelonging to God (Wainwright 2002). On the other hand, many religions\nhold that some kind of basic knowledge of God is universal but can be\nsuppressed, sometimes called the “natural knowledge of\nGod” (Green 2013). Paul’s letter to the Romans claims that\n“since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities\nhave been clearly seen”. Calvin famously posits that there is a\nsensus divinitatis that provides us with at least a basic\nsense of the divine. According to Jonathan Edwards, there is\n“sufficient light for the knowledge of God”, hence,\nnonbelievers must fail to believe “divine things” owing to\n“a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish\ninsensibility of their truth and importance” (quoted in\nWainwright 2002). This insensibility consists in a “proneness to\nidolatry” and a “disregard of eternal\nthings”—dispositions to ignore familiar and obvious\nconsiderations, to be swayed by ridicule and deference to people in\nauthority, to be prejudiced against religion, and so on, which impair\nthe God-given ability to reason properly about God. People bring such\nimpairments on themselves (Henry 2001, 2008; Lehe 2004; Moroney 2000).\nHowever, if we deny the existence of nonresistant nonbelievers, we must square\nour denial with the evidence marshalled on behalf of their existence\n(Schellenberg 2005c). \nAccording to Maitzen (2006), \nOther countries and geographic regions display an uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief, even though it is not as stark as it is in\nThailand and Saudi Arabia (Pew 2012).\nAccording to Maitzen, even if we grant, just for the sake of argument,\nthe success of some of the theistically friendly explanations of\nnonbelief in individuals, none of them explain the “geographic\npatchiness” of nonbelief. That’s because those\nexplanations invoke motivations, attitudes, and dispositions that\n“do not cluster by country or culture so as to show up twenty\ntimes more often in Thailand than in Saudi Arabia” (Maitzen\n2006: 184). After all, it’s not as though the Thai are twenty\ntimes more likely than the Saudis to be resistant to belief of God, or\nin need of prompting to recognize the wretchedness of life without\nGod, or in need of the sort of risk that’s required of a\npassionate faith in God; it’s not as though the Thai are twenty\ntimes more likely than the Saudis, upon coming to believe in God, to\nbe coerced into love, trust, and obedience, or disposed to act out of\nimproper motives like fear of punishment, or be presumptuous in their\nrelationship with God, and so on (2006: 180–185). Indeed, even\nif we grant, just for the sake of argument again, that there is great\nvalue in a diversity of belief and nonbelief of God,  \nwhy doesn’t this valuable diversity flourish within the cultures\nof Saudi Arabia and Thailand? Naturalistic explanations, including\ncultural and political explanations offered by social science, have an\neasier time of it,  \ncompared to theistic explanations since, on naturalism,  \nthe patchiness of theistic belief has everything to do with the\nnotoriously haphazard play of human culture and politics and nothing\nto do with God: the messy, uneven data have messy, uneven causes.\n(2006: 183)  \nMoreover, it seems implausible that God would be selective in the way\nGod related to different people groups, as though God took\nconsiderably more pains to make sure that those in the Middle East,\nrather than Thailand or China or India, came to belief. One would\nantecedently expect that God would have the motivation and wherewithal\nto treat all people equally on this score, which is hard to square\nwith God’s love and justice. So it is that the demographics of\nnonbelief are better explained naturalistically than theistically, and\nso those demographics constitute evidence for atheism (cf. Zagzebski\n1994). \nBy way of reply, Marsh (2008) draws on Molinism in order to display\nhow the demographics of nonbelief might be more likely on theism than\nMaitzen suggests. According to Molinism, God knows what free creatures\nwould freely do in counterfactual situations, and God uses this\ninformation in the way God governs the universe. So, suppose that God\nknew that (i) there is a group of persons P  \nthat are such that, no matter what creative act God had performed, if\nPs had existed, Ps would have freely rejected God in\ntheir earthly lives  \nhad they believed, and “those genuinely deprived of the\nopportunity to believe in God in this world” belong to that\ngroup (2008: 467). Furthermore, since God knows that  \nthese individuals wouldn’t come to love Him short of something\nlike a beatific vision, God sequesters them in order to secure their\neventual conversion,  \nin an afterlife. God’s decision to sequester them “largely\ncashes out in terms of the geographic circumstances in which they are\nplaced”, and keeps them “innocent for a later time, when\nthey will be in a position truly to love God” upon coming to\nbelief (2008: 468). Finally, suppose that, given the counterfactual\nprofiles of each individual essence, there is no better distribution\nof belief and nonbelief than the actual one. In this theistically\nfriendly hypothesis, the demographics of nonbelief are at least as\nexpectable on theism as naturalism. Likewise for a Calvinist\nexplanation:  \nDeterminism is true and souls may be divided into two kinds, the Elect\nand the Non-Elect. The Elects’ souls are born into societal\nsituations in which they are determined to come to the ante\nmortem beliefs necessary for salvation; the non-Elects’ are\nborn into societal situations in which they’re not, indeed\nthey’re determined to fail to come to these beliefs. (Mawson\n2012: 191–192) \nMany theists will find Molinist and Calvinist explanations unappealing\nsince they depend on middle knowledge and double predestination\nrespectively. But another difficulty is that the strategy appears, at\nleast at first glance, more than a little bit offensive. One of the\ngreat triumphs of modern ethics is the widespread acknowledgement of\nthe moral reprehensibility of considering some people groups inferior\nto others. Postulating that non-theistic populations are comprised of\npeople who wouldn’t respond appropriately to God no matter what,\nin this life, seems to flout this insight; and postulating that\nnon-theistic populations are comprised of people who are elect to\neternal damnation might be seen in the same light. (For further\ndiscussion, see Maitzen 2008; Mawson 2009, 2012.) \nMawson 2012 argues that, on theism, the demographics of nonbelief are\nexpectable, given either of two auxiliary hypotheses. First, suppose\nGod wants everyone to believe, but God wants much more everyone to\nbelieve without God’s having to interfere with the freedom of\npeople. Of course, one of the things that people can use their freedom\nto do is either to spread theistic belief or to restrict the spread of\ntheistic belief. Given that people’s receptivity to theistic\nbelief is dependent on the culture in which they are brought up and so\nforth, we’d expect to find that belief and nonbelief are\ndistributed unevenly. Second, what if God wants more than anything\neveryone to believe, say, because it is necessary for salvation? In\nthat case, we must ask what “deadline” God has set for\nsatisfying that desire. Mawson writes:  \nThere are two plausible suggestions for “deadlines” for\nGod: either that he has set for each individual his or her own\ndeadline and set it as the moment of his or her death, or that he has\nset us collectively one and the same deadline, the Eschaton/Last\nJudgment. (2012: 194)  \nIf God’s “deadline” is the Last Judgment, then, once\nagain, it’s not the least bit surprising that, since\npeople’s receptivity to theistic belief is dependent on the\nculture in which they are brought up and so forth, belief and\nnonbelief are distributed unevenly. Oddly enough, Mawson does not\nmention a third deadline, the one that Schellenberg has been on about\nfor nearly three decades: the dawn of an individual’s capacity\nto relate personally with God. If that were God’s\n“deadline”, would we still expect the uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief we find across the globe? \nBaker-Hytch (forthcoming) argues that the uneven distribution of\nbelief and nonbelief is about as likely on theism as on naturalism\nsince (i) the probability of that distribution on what we know about\n“mutual epistemic dependence” is high, (ii) the\nprobability of what we know about mutual epistemic dependence on\n“inclusive theism”—the view that the eternal destiny\nof human beings is not determined by what they believe at\ntheir natural deaths—is about the same as it is on naturalism,\nand (iii) the probability of inclusive theism on theism is much higher\nthan is non-inclusive theism. See Talbot 2014 for a Christian defense\nof (iii). \nTo say that we are mutually epistemically dependent is to say\nthat we are  \ncognitively constituted in such a way that it is a practical necessity\nthat we rely upon testimony for much of what we know about the world\nand in such a way, moreover, that we are liable to be significantly\ninfluenced by what those around us believe, particularly when it comes\nto matters that aren’t readily susceptible to empirical\ninvestigation, including religious matters. (Baker-Hytch forthcoming:\n3)  \nMutual epistemic dependence, so understood, says Baker-Hytch, is a\nconsequence of, among other things, “two types of cognitive bias\nthat play a significant role in determining how plausible we will tend\nto find a given item of testimony”: context biases,\nsuch as conformity, prestige, and similarity biases, which together\nmake it much more likely that we accept the testimony of those we\npersonally trust and respect in our communities, and content\nbiases, stemming from the dominance of intuitive processing over\nreflective processing and the attractiveness of “minimally\ncounterintuitive” ideas, especially religious ones, which are\nmore likely to spread via testimony (Barrett 2011: 52–72;\nKahneman 2013; Boyer 2001: 87–100). Thus, given mutual\nepistemic dependence, we would expect to see considerable divergence\nin the content of religious beliefs and clustering of those beliefs\nalong geographic and cultural lines. So, (i) seems supported. \nIn defense of (ii), Baker-Hytch argues that mutual epistemic\ndependence provides a balance between competing goods such as (a)\nexercising interpersonal trust and being invulnerable to deception,\n(b) sharing responsibility for one another’s acquisition of\nepistemic goods and practicing epistemic self-reliance, and (c) having\nopportunities to acquire, practice, and perfect the intellectual\nvirtues and freedom from intellectual obstacles and challenges. Since\nmutual epistemic dependence provides a balance between goods such as\nthese, he claims it wouldn’t be surprising if God were to bring\nit about; indeed, mutual epistemic dependence seems roughly as likely\non inclusive theism as it is on naturalism. \nMarsh (2013) focuses on natural nonbelief of God,  \n“natural” in the sense of being built into the physical or\nbiological structure of the world, and being generally outside the\nscope of human agency and control. (2013: 355)  \nThe cognitive science of religion, combined with ethnographic data for\npre-industrial cultures (Barrett 2007; Bloom 2009;\nStark 2007), show that\n \nearly humans, including many anatomically and behaviorally modern\nhumans, originally lacked a concept of God and were religiously\nrestricted to concepts of limited, and sometimes mean, supernatural\nagents. As a result, many [such humans] failed to believe in God or\nanything like God. The nonbelief in question was both naturally\noccurring and nonresistant. (Marsh 2013: 359)  \nThe “millions and millions” of instances of natural,\nnonresistant nonbelief in early humans is much more surprising on\ntheism than on naturalism, since it is very surprising that “the\nhuman mind would be naturally so insensitive to the truth about\nreligion” “given that a perfect God would desire to enter\ninto a divine-human relationship with early humans”, whereas\n“[g]iven naturalism’s commitment to indifference about\nwhether early humans would be theists”, it’s much less\nsurprising. \nMatters get only worse when one adds that (i) Darwinian\nevolution—“the claim that natural selection, working on\nrandom mutation, is the driving force behind much, if not most,\nevolutionary change” (351)—helps to explain natural\nnonbelief in early humans and (ii) Darwinian evolution is much more\nlikely on naturalism than theism. As for (i), \nAs for (ii), “Darwinism starts out more likely on naturalism\nthan on theism” because “Darwinism is highly optional on\ntheism”, as evidenced by the fact that “an omnipotent God\nwould have many non-Darwinian ways to create minds, bodies, and souls\nand would not be limited to Darwinian or even physical\nconstraints”, whereas on naturalism, “the options for\ndeveloping life are much more constrained, especially in the relevant\ntime frame” (360–61). \nSo it is, says Marsh, that natural, nonresistant nonbelief in early\nhumans constitutes evidence for naturalism over theism and, when\ncombined with Darwinian evolution, that evidential force increases\nsubstantially. \nTo date, Marsh’s\nargument has not received sustained attention in the literature (though cf. Vandergriff 2016). Many of the considerations\nadduced with respect to the other arguments from nonbelief will need to be weighed carefully in the context of Marsh’s argument as well.","contact.mail":"Dan.Howard-Snyder@wwu.edu","contact.domain":"wwu.edu"},{"date.published":"2016-04-23","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-hiddenness/","author1":"Daniel Howard-Snyder","author1.info":"http://faculty.wwu.edu/~howardd/","author2.info":"http://sites.google.com/site/adamgreenphilosopher/","entry":"divine-hiddenness","body.text":"\n\n\n“Divine hiddenness”, as the phrase suggests, refers, most\nfundamentally, to the hiddenness of God, i.e., the alleged fact that\nGod is hidden, absent, silent. In religious literature, there is a\nlong history of expressions of annoyance, anxiety, and despair over\ndivine hiddenness, so understood. For example, ancient Hebrew texts\nlament God’s failure to show up in experience or to show proper\nregard for God’s people or some particular person, and two\nChristian Gospels portray Jesus, in his cry of dereliction on the\ncross, as experiencing abandonment by God, whom he regarded as\n“Abba, Father”, an experience shared by many mystics,\nsaints, and ordinary folk of all theistic traditions, described at its\nworst as “the dark night of the soul”. Understood in this\nway, divine hiddenness poses an existential problem for those who have\nsuch experiences.\n\n\nHowever, “divine hiddenness” refers to something else in\nrecent philosophical literature, especially since the publication of\nJ.L. Schellenberg’s landmark book, Divine Hiddenness and\nHuman Reason (1993). In this context, it refers to alleged facts\nabout the absence of belief of God, on the basis of which one might\nthink there is no God. For example, Schellenberg argues that, since\nthere are nonbelievers who are capable of a personal relationship with\nGod and who do not resist it, there is no perfectly loving God, while\nStephen Maitzen argues that naturalism better explains the\n“demographics” of nonbelief than theism and Jason Marsh\nargues that naturalism better explains “natural nonbelief”\nthan theism. Understood in this way, divine hiddenness constitutes\nputative evidence for atheism.\n\n\nAlthough some of the recent philosophical literature addresses the\nproblem understood in the first way (e.g., DeWeese-Boyd 2016; Garcia\n2002), this entry focuses on divine hiddenness understood in the\nsecond way. The first section discusses the relationships between\nnonbelief and another source of alleged evidence for atheism: evil.\nThe second section states and defends the argument from nonresistant\nnonbelief. The third section sketches attempts to explain nonresistant\nnonbelief from a theistic perspective. The fourth section states other\nresponses to the argument from nonresistant nonbelief. The fifth\nsection discusses the argument from the demographics of nonbelief and\nthe sixth section discusses the argument from natural nonbelief.\n\n\nSeveral relationships between nonbelief and evil appear when we view\nthem as providing evidence for atheism. \n(A) It is customary to distinguish “logical”\n(“deductive”) arguments from evil from\n“evidential” (“inductive”,\n“abductive”, “probabilistic”) arguments from\nevil. There are different ways to draw that distinction. On one way\n(Howard-Snyder 1996c), a logical argument from evil affirms of some\nknown fact about evil that it is incompatible with theism (e.g.,\nMackie 1955; Schellenberg 2007a), while an evidential argument from\nevil does not—either because it affirms that the fact in\nquestion, although incompatible with theism, is not known but only\nreasonably believed to be the case (e.g., Rowe 1979), or because it affirms that\nthe fact in question, though known, is more surprising on theism than\non some competing hypothesis (e.g., Draper 1989; Oppy 2013). Likewise\nfor nonbelief. A logical argument from nonbelief affirms of some known\nfact about nonbelief that it is incompatible with the existence of God\n(Drange 1998), while an evidential argument from nonbelief does\nnot—either because it affirms that the fact in question,\nalthough incompatible with theism, is not known but only reasonably\nbelieved (Schellenberg 1993, 2015), or because it affirms that the\nfact in question, though known, is more surprising on theism than on\nsome competing hypothesis (Maitzen 2006; Marsh 2013). \n(B) It is a matter of dispute whether nonbelief provides evidence for\natheism independently of evil. Those in favor of independence invite\nus to imagine a world with no pain, suffering, or moral\nvice/wrongdoing. No one in such a world would appeal to evil as\nevidence for atheism, but someone might appeal to nonbelief as\nevidence for atheism (van Inwagen 2002, 2008; Schellenberg 2010a). Those in favor of\ndependence tend to define “evil” more broadly. For\nexample, they might say that evils are just bad states of affairs,\nwhether pain, suffering, or moral vice/wrongdoing, on the one hand, or\nnonbelief, on the other hand (Kvanvig 2002). Alternatively, they might\nargue in an Augustinian spirit that, since evil just is a lack of a\ngood that should exist, and since belief of God is a good that should\nexist, nonbelief is an evil. \n(C) Even if nonbelief provides evidence for atheism independently of\nevil, critical responses to arguments from nonbelief and evil share\nimportant similarities. For example, just as some critics try to\nexplain why God permits evil, so some critics try to explain why God\npermits nonbelief. Moreover, just as some critics argue that we are in\nno position to say that there are no unknown reasons for God to permit\nevil, so some critics argue that we are in no position to say that\nthere are no unknown reasons for God to permit nonbelief. Furthermore,\njust as some critics deny the relevant facts about evil, so some\ncritics deny the relevant facts about nonbelief. In addition, just as\nsome people say evil provides evidence against theism only if we\nconceive of God in certain ways, and so we should conceive of God\ndifferently, so some people say that nonbelief provides evidence\nagainst theism only if we conceive of God in certain ways, and so we\nshould conceive of God differently. Finally, just as some people grant\nthat evil gives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things\ngive theism much more weight, so some people grant that nonbelief\ngives atheism some weight and yet insist that other things give theism\nmuch more weight. \n(D) We can see another connection between arguments from evil and\nnonbelief by way of one of William Rowe’s evidential arguments\nfrom evil. Obviously enough, there is horrific suffering in the world;\nbut, says Rowe, God exists only if there is a reason for God to permit\nsuch suffering. However, since there is no reason that we know of,\nit’s reasonable to infer that there is no reason, period (Rowe\n1979). Thus, it’s\nreasonable to infer that God does not exist. Some critics question the\nreasonableness of Rowe’s inference from “there is no\nreason we know of” to “there is no reason, period”,\non the grounds that it assumes that we are in a good position to tell\nwhether there is a reason, an assumption they regard as dubious since\nit would not be the least bit surprising if there were a reason that\nwas accessible to God but not to us. These critics are too quick,\nhowever. For we must distinguish two ways in which we might be in a\ngood position to tell whether something exists. The first way is\ndirect: we are in a position to see or mentally apprehend it for\nourselves. The second way is indirect: although we are not in a good\nposition to see or mentally apprehend it for ourselves, we are in a\ngood position to see or apprehend something else and, seeing or\napprehending that other thing, we are in a good position to infer\nreasonably that the first thing exists. The critics are too quick\nbecause they ignore the second, indirect way in which we might be in a\ngood position to tell whether something exists. This is where\nnonbelief might come into play. For one might argue that if\nGod’s reasons for permitting a person to undergo horrific\nsuffering were inaccessible to them, then God would make it clear to\nthem that there is such a reason through clear assurances of\nGod’s love and care, clear enough so that they are in a good\nposition to believe that God has a reason to permit their suffering.\nBut many people who suffer do not believe that God has a reason to\npermit their suffering, not least because they do not believe that God\nexists. So it is that nonbelief arguably vindicates Rowe’s\nassumption and inference (Bergmann 2001; Howard-Snyder 1992, 1996b;\nRowe 2001; Trakakis 2007b). \n(E) An additional connection between evil and nonbelief consists in\ntrying to use various theistically friendly explanations of the facts\nabout evil to address concerns regarding the facts about nonbelief\nand, conversely, trying to use various theistically friendly\nexplanations of the facts about nonbelief to address concerns\nregarding the facts about evil. For example, one might argue that just\nas deep responsibility for each other’s wellbeing explains\nGod’s permission of some sin and suffering, so it explains\nGod’s permission of some nonbelief (Swinburne 1998). Or, alternatively, if there\nis a good reason for God to permit nonbelief, then God also has good\nreason not to intervene systematically to prevent or undo the\nconsequences of wrongdoing (for if God did so intervene, God’s\nexistence would be clear enough to prevent nonbelief), and so God has\nsome reason to permit some of the suffering that is a natural\nconsequence of wrongdoing (Dumsday 2015c). \n(F) Just as we must distinguish evil providing an argumentative basis\nfor atheism from evil providing a non-argumentative basis for atheism,\nso we must distinguish nonbelief providing an argumentative basis for\natheism from nonbelief providing a non-argumentative basis for\natheism. In the case of evil, this might work by\n“seeing right there in the evil that the world was\nGodless or that the evil was so repugnant as to be irredeemable”\n(Gellman 2013: 11). Likewise, in the case of nonbelief, this might\nwork by seeing right there in the nonresistant nonbeliever that the\nworld was Godless or that the nonresistant nonbelief was so repugnant\nas to be divinely impermissible. \n\nMore than anyone else, Schellenberg has shaped the\ncontemporary debate over arguments from nonbelief. The main argument\nfrom his 1993 book can be stated as follows: \nFor the defense of premise (2), Schellenberg’s reasoning\nprovides the following subargument: \n(2d) is tantamount to premise\n (2) of the main argument. \nIn his post-1993 writings, Schellenberg clarifies that he means his\nclaims about God, love, and relationship to be necessary truths.\nMoreover, the main argument of his 2007a replaces talk of\n“culpability” with talk of “resistance”.\n(“I now see this focus on culpability and inculpability as a\nmistake”; 2015: 54.) And he emphasizes “meaningful\nconscious relationship”. Finally, his 2015 and 2016 focuses on\nthe “openness” of “a perfectly loving God” to\n“positively meaningful” and “reciprocal conscious\nrelationship”. Thus, the latest version of the argument\n(slightly condensed): \nSchellenberg argues for premise\n (4)\n on the basis of what he calls ultimism, the proposition that\nthere is a reality that is ultimate in three ways. A\nmetaphysically ultimate reality, he says,  \nis something whose existence is the ultimate or most fundamental fact\nabout the nature of things, in terms of which any other fact about\nwhat things exist and how they exist would have to be explained in a\ncomprehensive and correct account.  \nAn axiologically ultimate reality “embod[ies] the\ndeepest possible value”, and “would have to be the\ngreatest possible reality”. A soteriologically ultimate\nreality is a reality in relation to which “the deepest or\nultimate human good can be attained” (2015: 19–21). The\nidea of a personal reality that is triply ultimate—that\nis, the idea of God in western philosophy, says Schellenberg—is\nthe idea of the greatest possible person; and, all else being\nequal, a person perfect in love would be an “improvement”\nover a person that was not perfect in love (2015: 89–103;\nSchellenberg 2005d). \nAs for premise\n (5),\n suppose God perfectly loves Anna. That love would minimally involve\nbenevolence, caring for Anna’s well-being. But it would also\ninvolve aiming “at relationship—a conscious and reciprocal\nrelationship that is positively meaningful, allowing for a deep\nsharing” between them. Moreover, it would involve valuing that\nrelationship for its own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else. Furthermore, it would never cease, and so God would\nalways value, seek, desire, promote, or preserve personal relationship\nwith Anna, although God would not force himself on her. At the very\nleast, says Schellenberg, all this requires that God will always be\nopen to personal relationship with her (2016:\n17–22). \nThis notion of openness with those who are capable of\nit—that is, with those who possess the cognitive and affective\nproperties required to participate in a personal relationship, which,\nin the case of God,  \nwould involve such things as a capacity to feel the presence of God,\nrecognizing it as such; a capacity to exhibit attitudes of trust,\ngratitude, and obedience to God, and so on (2016: 21n15)  \n—is crucial. Schellenberg writes: \nExpanding on what he means by “resistance of God”,\nSchellenberg tells us that if we think \nOf course, there are many other ways in which one might “shut\nthe door” or “close one’s eyes” and, as a\nresult, lack belief of God. \nAs for\n (6),\n by Schellenberg’s lights, Anna could not even begin to be in a\npositively meaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with God\nunless she believed that God exists. Why? Because \nThe upshot is that, if God is open to being in a positively meaningful\nand reciprocal conscious relationship with Anna, then, at any time\nthat she is capable of such a relationship, Anna will believe that God\nexists—unless she has done something that results in her being\nresistant to such a relationship at that time. \nAlthough Schellenberg emphasizes the point that perfect love seeks\nrelationship for its own sake, and not merely for the sake of\nsomething else, there are additional benefits one should bear in mind\nthat may be jeopardized by divine hiddenness. For consider the\nbenefits to Anna if she were in a positively meaningful, explicit,\nreciprocal conscious relationship with God, even if just one that was\ndevelopmentally in its infancy. First, there would be moral benefits,\ne.g., she would be able to draw on the resources of that relationship\nto overcome flaws in her character, and so she would be more likely to\nemulate the self-giving love with which she was loved, and thus more\nlikely to flourish as a finite person. Second, there would be\nexperiential benefits. She would be, e.g., more likely to experience\npeace and joy stemming from her belief that she is properly related to\nher Maker, and security in believing that, ultimately, all shall be\nwell even if she suffers in the meantime; and she would have the\nprofound pleasure of God’s loving presence. As a consequence of\nthese moral and experiential benefits, Anna’s relationships with\nothers would likely improve (Schellenberg 1993: 19ff). \nAs for the empirical\n premise—(7),\n and the earlier\n (1)—Schellenberg\n generalizes from (a) honest seekers of the truth who remain agnostics\nand atheists, including those whose search leads them to convert to\nnontheistic religions, (b) members of cultures that lack the idea of a\npersonal God altogether, e.g., the Chinese in the period from the\nbeginning of their history until the Christian Middle Ages, (c)\nhunter-gatherers prior to recorded history, and (d) those who have\nlost their theistic faith, and who would like nothing more than to\nregain it. Furthermore, Schellenberg appeals to increased secularity,\nespecially in Western cultures: what is the probability that\nall of the hundreds of millions of nonbelievers in the\nsecular West are, at the dawn of their capacity to relate personally\nwith God, resistant? Vanishingly small (2015: 76ff; 2007a: 205, 228ff). \nIt follows from Schellenberg’s premises\n (4)–(6)\n that, necessarily, if God exists, then, for any capable finite person\nS and time t, it is not the case that S is at\nt nonresistantly in a state of nonbelief in relation to the\nproposition that God exists. In short, God’s existence entails\nthere’s never any nonresistant nonbelief. To assess this\nimplication we must assess the premises from which it follows. In this\nsection, we focus on premise\n (5)\n and a particular kind of assessment, something analogous to theodicy\nin the literature on the problem of evil. To help us keep our focus,\nsuppose we grant premises\n (4)\n and\n (6).\n Moreover, since we want to assess premise\n (5)\n from as sympathetic a position as we can, suppose we grant\nSchellenberg’s claim that one is open to a positively\nmeaningful and reciprocal conscious relationship with another, in a\nmanner consistent with perfect love, only if one never does anything\n(by commission or omission) that would result in the other being\nprevented from participating in that relationship, just by trying.\nGiven these suppositions, we might wonder whether premise\n (5)\n is true since we might wonder whether it is possible that God\nperfectly loves such finite persons as there may be and yet, for at\nleast some of them, God does something (by commission or omission)\nthat results in them lacking belief of God—even though they have\nthe capacity for a positively meaningful and reciprocal conscious\nrelationship with God and they are not in a state of resistance to\nGod. In particular, we might wonder whether there are any\nreasons for a perfectly loving God to do something (by\ncommission or omission) that would result in nonresistant nonbelief in\npersons who are capable of relating personally with God in this\nway. \nThere are many cases of this type to wonder about. Here are two.\nFirst, imagine someone who has always lacked belief and who has always\nlacked the capacity to relate personally with God but who is,\nnonetheless, nonresistant to God. Such a person might be a child who\nis at the dawn of her capacity to relate personally with God. Might\nthere be good enough reason, consistent with perfect love, for God to\ndo something (by commission or omission) that results in her being\nprevented from belief, even as she transitions to being capable of\nrelating personally with God while remaining nonresistant? Second,\nimagine a man who has had the capacity to relate personally with God\nfor some time, and who was once a fulfilled nonresistant believer but\nwho, for one reason or another, is now in a state of resistant\nnonbelief. Many a university student might satisfy this description,\namong others. Might there be good enough reason, consistent with\nperfect love, for God to do something (by commission or omission) that\nresults in that man being prevented from belief of God even as, later\nin life, he transitions back to being nonresistant? \nAffirmative answers to these questions involve reasons for thinking it\nwould be better if they remained nonbelievers, at least for a time,\ndespite their transitions. For example, what if the child never ever\nexercised any influence over whether she was nonresistant to God?\nPerhaps, in that case, it would be better—for her, and for God,\nand for their forthcoming relationship—if she were first to own\nher good disposition toward God through choices in the face of\ncontrary inclinations, so that, among other things, her loving and\nobeying God was of her own accord when she came to believe. Or perhaps\nher non-resistance to God is grounded in improper motives, e.g., fear\nof punishment, a desire for parental approval or social acceptance,\nand the like, and so God gives her the opportunity to change her\nmotives so that, upon coming to believe, her love and obedience are\nmore properly motivated (Howard-Snyder 1996a, 2016). Or perhaps her\nmoral autonomy and freedom would be objectionably reduced if God were\nto bring her to belief at this time (Hick 1966; Murray 2002; Swinburne\n1979). Or perhaps,\ndespite her non-resistance, if she came to belief now instead of\nlater, the passion and intensity of her desire for God would be\nsignificantly less than it otherwise would be. Or perhaps she is disposed, upon\ncoming to believe now, to think she has arrived at a proper\nunderstanding of God, and she would become complacent or relate to God\nat a superficial level. (Kierkegaard 1844: 28-29, 33-35; cf.\nSchellenberg 1993: 160ff). Or perhaps certain intellectual temptations\nwould be lost on her if she were to believe now, and so she would not\nhave the opportunity to respond to them virtuously (Butler 1736: part 2, chapter 6; cf.\nSchellenberg 1993: 168ff). Or perhaps upon coming to believe now, she\nwould be resentful or envious of God’s glory and greatness\n(Dumsday 2012a). Or what if the university student, despite his\nforthcoming return to non-resistance, was disposed to relate to God in\npresumptuous or arrogant ways upon regaining belief, and not with due\ncontrition and humility, both of which are essential to a proper\nrelationship with God? Or what if he was disposed to be significantly\nless apt to recognize the wretchedness of living life on his own,\nwithout God, if he were to regain belief now instead of later? (Pascal 1670, Fragments 234, 378, 427, 446, 449; cf. Schellenberg 1993: 136ff). Or\nwhat if God does not bring him to belief because he is ill-disposed to\nthe sort of moral transformation God intends for him, or he’s\ninto having a relationship with God just for the pleasure and\ntitillation of it? (Dumsday 2014b; Moser 2002, 2008b) Or what if God\ndoes not bring him to belief because, as a general policy, God permits\nsome people in positions like his to continue in nonbelief in order to\nincrease diverse expressions of religious imagination, creativity, and\ndevotion, or in order to increase opportunities for people to pursue\nknowledge of important matters together, even knowledge as important\nas knowledge of God, or in order to promote assisting each other in\nstarting personal relationships with God (Dumsday 2010b; Schellenberg\n1993: 181ff; Swinburne 1998); or because, under present circumstances,\nbringing all non-resistant believers to belief would force the truth\nof theism on the resistant (Dumsday forthcoming-a). And there are\nother explanations offered as well. \nSeveral points have emerged in the literature with respect to\nassessing these reasons or explanations. \nFirst, it’s doubtful that any single one of them offers a total\nexplanation of nonresistant nonbelief. Different kinds of nonresistant\nnonbelievers, given the rest of their psychology, might call for\ndifferent explanations. Moreover, each of these explanations, taken\nalone, might fail to provide a total explanation of any particular\nkind or instance of nonresistant nonbelief, and yet each of them might\nprovide a partial explanation and, taken together with others, add up\nto a total explanation. At least this is a possibility that must not\nbe overlooked. Thus, if we are to reject these explanations, and\nothers that might be proffered, we must claim that they fail,\ncollectively as well as individually, to account for why God might\npermit nonresistant nonbelief. \nSecond, in light of the foregoing point, even if there are some\nnonresistant nonbelievers, it may well be quite difficult to discern\nwhether they possess or fail to possess those motivations, attitudes,\nand dispositions that allegedly explain their nonbelief in a\ntheistically friendly fashion. If the difficulty is severe enough,\nthen it might be that no one—whether theists, atheists,\nagnostics, or what-have-you—is well-positioned to say that there\nare some nonresistant nonbelievers. \nOf course—and this is the third point—we might well argue\nthat these explanations provide no good reason, individually or\ncollectively, for God to permit nonresistant nonbelief. That’s\nbecause the good states of affairs to which they appeal can be\naccommodated within a developing, positively meaningful and reciprocal\nconscious relationship with God, or because the benefits of such a\nrelationship with God exceed the goods to which these explanations\nappeal, or because, more generally, this sort of relationship with God\nis the greatest good and so God wouldn’t pursue lesser goods at\nits expense (Howard-Snyder and Moser 2002a; Schellenberg 1993, 1996,\n2005a, 2005b, 2007a, 2015; McBrayer and Swenson 2012; Trakakis\n2007a). \nFourth, one might worry that the whole enterprise of providing a\ntheistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief is\nmisguided. After all, if God exists, why didn’t God create a\nworld in which there never was or ever will be any nonresistant\nnonbelief? Why would God create or permit resisters and nonbelievers\nin the first place? Surely he could have created persons who never\nresisted and always believed. \nEven if no theistically friendly explanation of nonresistant nonbelief\nwe know of completely satisfies us, we might yet wonder about\nSchellenberg’s premise\n (4):\n necessarily, if God exists, then God perfectly loves such finite\npersons as there may be. \nOn the one hand, we might wonder whether, if God exists, God perfectly\nloves anyone, at least as defined by how we understand love.\nIn this connection, some critics have pointed out that many\n“classical theists” affirm a conception of God according\nto which God is transcendent and ineffable, and so beyond all human\ncomprehension, and so neither personal nor non-personal, and so\nneither loving nor non-loving (Rea 2016; Ross 2002; Trakakis 2016). It\nis certainly less than clear what a conscious, reciprocal relationship\nwould look like with the God of apophaticism. Moreover, even if there\nis a personal God, God might be indifferent to finite created persons,\nand so not love them—an implication of some versions of\nDeism. \nOn the other hand, we might wonder whether, even if God is perfect in\nlove, God would perfectly love such finite persons as there may be.\nFor, in light of an idea suggested as worthy of consideration by Hud Hudson in private correspondence,  \nto love perfectly is for one’s love to be in the right\nproportion to the object of one’s love, everything\nconsidered—loving to the degree that matches the degree of\nworthiness to be loved.  \nTherefore, even if God is perfectly loving, it does not follow that\nGod loves such finite persons as there may be since they may have\npolluted themselves, rendered themselves utterly unlovable; “and\nit is, of course, no symptom of a disordered love to fail to love the\nunlovable”. \nOne might also wonder about premise\n (5):\n necessarily, if God perfectly loves such finite persons as there may\nbe, then, for any capable finite person S and time t,\nGod is at t open to being in a positively meaningful and\nreciprocal conscious relationship with S at t. Whether\nthis is true might depend on what sort of love is perfect, whether it\nis more like that of a mother for her child, or a grandparent for her\ndistant descendants, or a benevolent reconstructive surgeon for her\npatient (Cuneo 2013; McGinnis 2016; Rea 2016; Schellenberg 2013). One\nmight argue that premise\n (5)\n is true only if perfect love is like the first, but wonder what\nfollows if it is like the second or third. In this connection, imagine\nthat what it is for God to perfectly love us is for God to provide for\nour greatest good, and suppose that our greatest good consists in our\nbeing virtuous, caring for our environment and other creatures. In\nthat case, it is not at all clear that a personal relationship of the\nsort Schellenberg imagines is necessary. So long as God has made our\nflourishing achievable, that is all that God’s perfect love\nshould lead us to expect. \nSuppose we grant Schellenberg’s understanding of openness to\nrelationship as well as his premise\n (6),\n and suppose we concede that no theistically friendly explanation of\nnonresistant nonbelief we know of is wholly satisfactory, either\nindividually or collectively. Even so, we might wonder whether we\nshould infer that a perfectly loving God would not permit nonresistant\nnonbelief. After all, an open-minded and intellectually humble\ninquirer will want to satisfy her natural curiosity about whether she\nis in a position to tell whether there are any reasons for God to\npermit nonresistant nonbelief that, although inaccessible to her,\nwould be accessible to God. For suppose that she were to discover\nthat, even if there is no good basis for thinking there is a God, and\neven if she does not know of any wholly satisfactory reason for God to\npermit nonresistant nonbelief, she should be in doubt about whether\nshe is in a position to tell whether there are any unknown reasons. In\nthat case, we would expect her open-mindedness and intellectual\nhumility to lead her to refrain from accepting that a perfectly loving\nGod would not permit nonresistant nonbelief and, in refraining from\naccepting this, she would refrain from accepting premise\n (5). \nThis assessment of the argument from nonbelief has its parallel in the\nproblem of evil literature where it is (badly) named “skeptical\ntheism”. It has been explicitly used in relation to the argument\nfrom nonbelief in Howard-Snyder 2016 and McBrayer and Swenson\n2012. For criticism, see\nSchellenberg 2007a, 2016.\nWhether this assessment leads to objectionable skepticism elsewhere is\na matter of ongoing debate. For discussion as it relates to the\nargument from evil, see Dougherty 2014; Dougherty and McBrayer 2014;\nHoward-Snyder 2009; McBrayer 2010; McBrayer and Howard-Snyder 2013;\nand Trakakis 2007b. \nEven if we accept premises\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n we might yet wonder about Schellenberg’s premise\n (6),\n the claim that God’s openness to a personal relationship with\ncapable nonresistant persons entails that such persons will believe\nthat God exists. Schellenberg argues that one cannot even “get\nstarted” in a personal relationship—a conscious,\nreciprocal, positively meaningful relationship—without believing\nthat the other party exists. It seems, however, that we might not only\n“get started” but get a long way into a conscious,\nreciprocal, positively meaningful relationship without belief that the\nother party exists. After all, might not a degree of confidence below\nthe threshold of belief, or acceptance, or imagination-based assent,\nor belief-less assuming, or trust, or even hope suffice? (See Alston\n1996; Audi 2011; Cohen 1992; Howard-Snyder 2013; McKaughan 2013;\nPoston and Dougherty 2007; Schellenberg 2011, 2014.) \nEven if states less than belief do suffice as the cognitive requirement for \"getting started\" in a relationship, however,\nwe might wonder whether they are as good as belief as a cognitive\nfoundation for a personal relationship with God; and, if they are not,\nwe might well question why a perfectly loving God provides less than\nthe best on this score. Furthermore, even if we grant, just for the\nsake of argument, that a perfectly loving God might provide less than\nthe best on this score, we might have just as good a reason for\nthinking that there are nonresistant\nnon-accepters/assenters/assumers/trusters/hopers who are capable of\nrelating personally with God as we do for thinking that there are\nnonresistant nonbelievers in that condition (Schellenberg 2007b,\n2016). \nLast but not least, we might wonder about premise\n (7):\n are there really any nonresistant nonbelievers with a capacity to\nrelate personally with God? According to some critics, everyone at\nleast implicitly believes in God, although not under the name\n“God” or under a description they might recognize as\nbelonging to God (Wainwright 2002). On the other hand, many religions\nhold that some kind of basic knowledge of God is universal but can be\nsuppressed, sometimes called the “natural knowledge of\nGod” (Green 2013). Paul’s letter to the Romans claims that\n“since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities\nhave been clearly seen”. Calvin famously posits that there is a\nsensus divinitatis that provides us with at least a basic\nsense of the divine. According to Jonathan Edwards, there is\n“sufficient light for the knowledge of God”, hence,\nnonbelievers must fail to believe “divine things” owing to\n“a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish\ninsensibility of their truth and importance” (quoted in\nWainwright 2002). This insensibility consists in a “proneness to\nidolatry” and a “disregard of eternal\nthings”—dispositions to ignore familiar and obvious\nconsiderations, to be swayed by ridicule and deference to people in\nauthority, to be prejudiced against religion, and so on, which impair\nthe God-given ability to reason properly about God. People bring such\nimpairments on themselves (Henry 2001, 2008; Lehe 2004; Moroney 2000).\nHowever, if we deny the existence of nonresistant nonbelievers, we must square\nour denial with the evidence marshalled on behalf of their existence\n(Schellenberg 2005c). \nAccording to Maitzen (2006), \nOther countries and geographic regions display an uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief, even though it is not as stark as it is in\nThailand and Saudi Arabia (Pew 2012).\nAccording to Maitzen, even if we grant, just for the sake of argument,\nthe success of some of the theistically friendly explanations of\nnonbelief in individuals, none of them explain the “geographic\npatchiness” of nonbelief. That’s because those\nexplanations invoke motivations, attitudes, and dispositions that\n“do not cluster by country or culture so as to show up twenty\ntimes more often in Thailand than in Saudi Arabia” (Maitzen\n2006: 184). After all, it’s not as though the Thai are twenty\ntimes more likely than the Saudis to be resistant to belief of God, or\nin need of prompting to recognize the wretchedness of life without\nGod, or in need of the sort of risk that’s required of a\npassionate faith in God; it’s not as though the Thai are twenty\ntimes more likely than the Saudis, upon coming to believe in God, to\nbe coerced into love, trust, and obedience, or disposed to act out of\nimproper motives like fear of punishment, or be presumptuous in their\nrelationship with God, and so on (2006: 180–185). Indeed, even\nif we grant, just for the sake of argument again, that there is great\nvalue in a diversity of belief and nonbelief of God,  \nwhy doesn’t this valuable diversity flourish within the cultures\nof Saudi Arabia and Thailand? Naturalistic explanations, including\ncultural and political explanations offered by social science, have an\neasier time of it,  \ncompared to theistic explanations since, on naturalism,  \nthe patchiness of theistic belief has everything to do with the\nnotoriously haphazard play of human culture and politics and nothing\nto do with God: the messy, uneven data have messy, uneven causes.\n(2006: 183)  \nMoreover, it seems implausible that God would be selective in the way\nGod related to different people groups, as though God took\nconsiderably more pains to make sure that those in the Middle East,\nrather than Thailand or China or India, came to belief. One would\nantecedently expect that God would have the motivation and wherewithal\nto treat all people equally on this score, which is hard to square\nwith God’s love and justice. So it is that the demographics of\nnonbelief are better explained naturalistically than theistically, and\nso those demographics constitute evidence for atheism (cf. Zagzebski\n1994). \nBy way of reply, Marsh (2008) draws on Molinism in order to display\nhow the demographics of nonbelief might be more likely on theism than\nMaitzen suggests. According to Molinism, God knows what free creatures\nwould freely do in counterfactual situations, and God uses this\ninformation in the way God governs the universe. So, suppose that God\nknew that (i) there is a group of persons P  \nthat are such that, no matter what creative act God had performed, if\nPs had existed, Ps would have freely rejected God in\ntheir earthly lives  \nhad they believed, and “those genuinely deprived of the\nopportunity to believe in God in this world” belong to that\ngroup (2008: 467). Furthermore, since God knows that  \nthese individuals wouldn’t come to love Him short of something\nlike a beatific vision, God sequesters them in order to secure their\neventual conversion,  \nin an afterlife. God’s decision to sequester them “largely\ncashes out in terms of the geographic circumstances in which they are\nplaced”, and keeps them “innocent for a later time, when\nthey will be in a position truly to love God” upon coming to\nbelief (2008: 468). Finally, suppose that, given the counterfactual\nprofiles of each individual essence, there is no better distribution\nof belief and nonbelief than the actual one. In this theistically\nfriendly hypothesis, the demographics of nonbelief are at least as\nexpectable on theism as naturalism. Likewise for a Calvinist\nexplanation:  \nDeterminism is true and souls may be divided into two kinds, the Elect\nand the Non-Elect. The Elects’ souls are born into societal\nsituations in which they are determined to come to the ante\nmortem beliefs necessary for salvation; the non-Elects’ are\nborn into societal situations in which they’re not, indeed\nthey’re determined to fail to come to these beliefs. (Mawson\n2012: 191–192) \nMany theists will find Molinist and Calvinist explanations unappealing\nsince they depend on middle knowledge and double predestination\nrespectively. But another difficulty is that the strategy appears, at\nleast at first glance, more than a little bit offensive. One of the\ngreat triumphs of modern ethics is the widespread acknowledgement of\nthe moral reprehensibility of considering some people groups inferior\nto others. Postulating that non-theistic populations are comprised of\npeople who wouldn’t respond appropriately to God no matter what,\nin this life, seems to flout this insight; and postulating that\nnon-theistic populations are comprised of people who are elect to\neternal damnation might be seen in the same light. (For further\ndiscussion, see Maitzen 2008; Mawson 2009, 2012.) \nMawson 2012 argues that, on theism, the demographics of nonbelief are\nexpectable, given either of two auxiliary hypotheses. First, suppose\nGod wants everyone to believe, but God wants much more everyone to\nbelieve without God’s having to interfere with the freedom of\npeople. Of course, one of the things that people can use their freedom\nto do is either to spread theistic belief or to restrict the spread of\ntheistic belief. Given that people’s receptivity to theistic\nbelief is dependent on the culture in which they are brought up and so\nforth, we’d expect to find that belief and nonbelief are\ndistributed unevenly. Second, what if God wants more than anything\neveryone to believe, say, because it is necessary for salvation? In\nthat case, we must ask what “deadline” God has set for\nsatisfying that desire. Mawson writes:  \nThere are two plausible suggestions for “deadlines” for\nGod: either that he has set for each individual his or her own\ndeadline and set it as the moment of his or her death, or that he has\nset us collectively one and the same deadline, the Eschaton/Last\nJudgment. (2012: 194)  \nIf God’s “deadline” is the Last Judgment, then, once\nagain, it’s not the least bit surprising that, since\npeople’s receptivity to theistic belief is dependent on the\nculture in which they are brought up and so forth, belief and\nnonbelief are distributed unevenly. Oddly enough, Mawson does not\nmention a third deadline, the one that Schellenberg has been on about\nfor nearly three decades: the dawn of an individual’s capacity\nto relate personally with God. If that were God’s\n“deadline”, would we still expect the uneven distribution\nof belief and nonbelief we find across the globe? \nBaker-Hytch (forthcoming) argues that the uneven distribution of\nbelief and nonbelief is about as likely on theism as on naturalism\nsince (i) the probability of that distribution on what we know about\n“mutual epistemic dependence” is high, (ii) the\nprobability of what we know about mutual epistemic dependence on\n“inclusive theism”—the view that the eternal destiny\nof human beings is not determined by what they believe at\ntheir natural deaths—is about the same as it is on naturalism,\nand (iii) the probability of inclusive theism on theism is much higher\nthan is non-inclusive theism. See Talbot 2014 for a Christian defense\nof (iii). \nTo say that we are mutually epistemically dependent is to say\nthat we are  \ncognitively constituted in such a way that it is a practical necessity\nthat we rely upon testimony for much of what we know about the world\nand in such a way, moreover, that we are liable to be significantly\ninfluenced by what those around us believe, particularly when it comes\nto matters that aren’t readily susceptible to empirical\ninvestigation, including religious matters. (Baker-Hytch forthcoming:\n3)  \nMutual epistemic dependence, so understood, says Baker-Hytch, is a\nconsequence of, among other things, “two types of cognitive bias\nthat play a significant role in determining how plausible we will tend\nto find a given item of testimony”: context biases,\nsuch as conformity, prestige, and similarity biases, which together\nmake it much more likely that we accept the testimony of those we\npersonally trust and respect in our communities, and content\nbiases, stemming from the dominance of intuitive processing over\nreflective processing and the attractiveness of “minimally\ncounterintuitive” ideas, especially religious ones, which are\nmore likely to spread via testimony (Barrett 2011: 52–72;\nKahneman 2013; Boyer 2001: 87–100). Thus, given mutual\nepistemic dependence, we would expect to see considerable divergence\nin the content of religious beliefs and clustering of those beliefs\nalong geographic and cultural lines. So, (i) seems supported. \nIn defense of (ii), Baker-Hytch argues that mutual epistemic\ndependence provides a balance between competing goods such as (a)\nexercising interpersonal trust and being invulnerable to deception,\n(b) sharing responsibility for one another’s acquisition of\nepistemic goods and practicing epistemic self-reliance, and (c) having\nopportunities to acquire, practice, and perfect the intellectual\nvirtues and freedom from intellectual obstacles and challenges. Since\nmutual epistemic dependence provides a balance between goods such as\nthese, he claims it wouldn’t be surprising if God were to bring\nit about; indeed, mutual epistemic dependence seems roughly as likely\non inclusive theism as it is on naturalism. \nMarsh (2013) focuses on natural nonbelief of God,  \n“natural” in the sense of being built into the physical or\nbiological structure of the world, and being generally outside the\nscope of human agency and control. (2013: 355)  \nThe cognitive science of religion, combined with ethnographic data for\npre-industrial cultures (Barrett 2007; Bloom 2009;\nStark 2007), show that\n \nearly humans, including many anatomically and behaviorally modern\nhumans, originally lacked a concept of God and were religiously\nrestricted to concepts of limited, and sometimes mean, supernatural\nagents. As a result, many [such humans] failed to believe in God or\nanything like God. The nonbelief in question was both naturally\noccurring and nonresistant. (Marsh 2013: 359)  \nThe “millions and millions” of instances of natural,\nnonresistant nonbelief in early humans is much more surprising on\ntheism than on naturalism, since it is very surprising that “the\nhuman mind would be naturally so insensitive to the truth about\nreligion” “given that a perfect God would desire to enter\ninto a divine-human relationship with early humans”, whereas\n“[g]iven naturalism’s commitment to indifference about\nwhether early humans would be theists”, it’s much less\nsurprising. \nMatters get only worse when one adds that (i) Darwinian\nevolution—“the claim that natural selection, working on\nrandom mutation, is the driving force behind much, if not most,\nevolutionary change” (351)—helps to explain natural\nnonbelief in early humans and (ii) Darwinian evolution is much more\nlikely on naturalism than theism. As for (i), \nAs for (ii), “Darwinism starts out more likely on naturalism\nthan on theism” because “Darwinism is highly optional on\ntheism”, as evidenced by the fact that “an omnipotent God\nwould have many non-Darwinian ways to create minds, bodies, and souls\nand would not be limited to Darwinian or even physical\nconstraints”, whereas on naturalism, “the options for\ndeveloping life are much more constrained, especially in the relevant\ntime frame” (360–61). \nSo it is, says Marsh, that natural, nonresistant nonbelief in early\nhumans constitutes evidence for naturalism over theism and, when\ncombined with Darwinian evolution, that evidential force increases\nsubstantially. \nTo date, Marsh’s\nargument has not received sustained attention in the literature (though cf. Vandergriff 2016). Many of the considerations\nadduced with respect to the other arguments from nonbelief will need to be weighed carefully in the context of Marsh’s argument as well.","contact.mail":"agreen@apu.edu","contact.domain":"apu.edu"}]
