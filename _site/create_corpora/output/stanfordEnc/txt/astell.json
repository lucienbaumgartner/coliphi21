She was born\nin Newcastle, and lived her adult life in London. Her patrons were\nLady Ann Coventry, Lady Elizabeth Hastings, and Catherine Jones, and\namong those in her intellectual circle were Lady Mary Chudleigh,\nJudith Drake, Elizabeth Elstob, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and John\nNorris. In addition to a number of pamphlets, she wrote the following\nbooks: \n\n  A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Parts I and II. Wherein a\nMethod is offer’d for the Improvement of their Minds (1694,\n1697)\n  Letters Concerning the Love of God Between the Author of\nthe Proposal to the Ladies and Mr. John Norris: Wherein his late\nDiscourse, shewing That it ought to be intire and exclusive of all\nother Loves, is further cleared and justified (1695)\n  Some\nReflections upon Marriage, Occasion’d by the Duke and Duchess of\nMazarine’s Case; which is also considered (1700)\n  The Christian Religion, As Profess’d by a Daughter Of the\nChurch of England (1705)\n \n Today she is best known for her theories on the education of women\nand her critiques of Norris and John Locke.\n\n\nMary Astell designed her metaphysics around an account of God and his\ncreation. She was a dualist, maintaining that the two kinds of\nbeings—minds and bodies—come in various degrees of\nfinitude and corruptibility: God is the infinite and incorruptible\nmind; human minds and corporeal particles are finite, naturally\nincorruptible beings; and human bodies and physical objects are\nfinite, naturally corruptible beings. \nAccording to Astell, God is the “First Intelligence,” the\nbeing whose nature is to be infinite in all perfections. Among his\nperfections, Astell often lists wisdom, goodness, justice, holiness,\nintelligence, presence, power, and self-existence. In keeping with\nrationalist views of the period, Astell maintains that the correct\nunderstanding of metaphysics turns on the correct understanding of\nGod.  For this reason, much of her work is dedicated to demonstrating\nnot only what God is, but also how a correct understanding of him can\nbe attained. \nHer earliest such account is in A Serious Proposal to the\nLadies, where she demonstrates the existence, perfection, and\nnecessary creative power of God. She begins by giving an example of\nthe correct method for attaining knowledge, one similar to those\ndeveloped by Descartes in Discourse on the Method and Arnauld\nand Nicole in Logic or the Art of Thinking (see section 2.3\nof this entry). Her proof of God’s existence includes an account of\nsimple and composed ideas; clear and distinct perceptions, and obscure\nand confused perceptions; adequate and inadequate ideas; proofs by\nintuition and proofs by comparison of ideas; God’s perfections and our\nideas of God’s perfections; and the relation between ideas and terms\n(Astell 2002, 176–182). In Christian Religion, she\nframes other arguments for God’s existence in terms of what we can and\ncannot doubt; God’s perfections and our ideas of God’s perfections;\ncausality; and the beauty of the created universe (Astell 1705,\n7–10 [sections 7–10]). \nAt times, Astell privileges some of God’s perfections over others. In\nChristian Religion, when stating her ontological argument for\nGod’s existence, she notes that “I find that the notion I have\nof GOD, contains those and all other perfections.  Among which\nSelf-existence is most remarkable, as being the original and basis of\nall the rest” (Astell 1705, 8 [section 7]). This claim is about\nthe order of ideas: her idea of God’s self-existence allows her\nto understand his other perfections. A few lines later, she makes the\nanalogous claim about the order of reality: “And Self-existence\nis such a Perfection as necessarily includes all other\nperfections” (Astell 1705, 8 [section 8]). \nBroad (2002a, 103) reveals evidence that Astell privileges God’s\nwisdom and goodness over his omnipotence. There are two ways that\nphilosophers of the period thought about God’s attributes of wisdom,\npower, and goodness. Some held “intellectualist” theories,\naccording to which God exercises his will in accordance with the true\nnature of things; others held  “voluntarist”\ntheories, according to which God exercises his will to create both\nthings and the truth of things. In showing that Astell maintains an\nintellectualist theology, Broad refers to a number of passages, one of\nwhich is the following: \nThroughout her texts, Astell is concerned with giving an account of\nhow created beings are individuated from each other. Ultimately, she\nmaintains that there are four kinds of created beings: minds, bodies,\nmind–body unions, and the particles that compose bodies. \nAbout finite minds considered on their own, Astell differs quite\nradically from Descartes. In Discourse on the Method,\nDescartes remarks that all minds have the same ability to reason (AT\n2; CSM 111). According to Astell, on the other hand, God creates minds\nwith intrinsic differences. She gives a number of reasons for this\nview. One has to do with the relationships that God wants minds to\nhave with each other: humans form community only if their minds have\ndifferent intellectual capacities. Another concerns the relationship\nbetween created minds and God: minds were made to contemplate and\nenjoy God, and God needs their adoration and love. But each mind is\nlimited and, thus, can only love God by adoring a limited amount of\nhis works. So God creates many minds, each with an ability to\nunderstand a certain collection of truths, and in this way all of his\ncreation is attended to (Astell 2002, 144–146,\n154–155). \nThough Astell discusses minds as if they are sometimes isolated from\nbodies, she maintains that human beings are mind–body\nunions. She notes that we cannot comprehend the connection between the\nmind and body: “We know and feel the Union between our Soul and\nBody, but who amongst us sees so clearly, as to find out with\nCertitude and Exactness, the secret ties which unite two such\ndifferent Substances, or how they are able to act upon each\nother?” (Astell 2002, 148) The union between the mind and body\nis mysterious; though we “know and feel” it, we\ndon’t have perfect knowledge of it or of how the mind and body\ninteract causally. In Christian Religion, Astell presents\nthis same position by way of a parallel between, on the one hand, our\nlack of knowledge of the mind–body union, and, on the other\nhand, our lack of knowledge about the relation between God and humans:\n“Again, tho’ I do not understand the Philosophy of the\nUnion between the Divine and Human Nature; (neither do I comprehend\nthe Vital Union between my Soul and Body, nor how and in what manner\nthey are joyn’d, tho’ I am sure that so it is)\n…” (Astell 1705, 51 [section 62]). \nAbout how mind–body unions differ from each other with respect\nto their abilities to reason, Astell sometimes implies that\nexperience, construed in a Lockean framework, may be the cause: \nHer more common view, however, is a rationalist one, according to\nwhich bodies impede minds from having perfect ideas: “For did we\nconsider what we Are, that Humane Nature consists in the Union of a\nRational Soul with a Mortal Body, that the Body very often Clogs the\nMind in its noblest Operations, especially when indulg’d”\n(Astell 2002, 210). She also presents this view in the following\npassage: \nHere Astell, like other rationalists, valorizes the mind over the\nbody. The following passage illustrates another way Astell emphasizes\nthis point: \nWhereas the body has merely an “instrumental” role with\nrespect to the mind, the mind has “dominion” over the\nbody, and a governing role over the passions. Humans should correctly\nemploy their minds and bodies so that they do not degenerate into\nbrutes, or conduct their lives as if they were angels. \nAstell’s account of the mind–body union allows her to argue\nagainst the popular view of the period about women, according to which\nwomen do not demonstrate the same kinds of intellectual abilities as\ndo men because women are inherently more closely united to their\nbodies than are men (Broad 2002a, 109). Equip with the rationalist\naccount of the mind–body union, Astell can show that the\nuniformity of women’s inabilities is rooted not in their natures, but\narises because of social practices.  Thus the difference between the\nabilities of women and men should be explained not metaphysically, but\nepistemologically.  For this reason, I will leave a discussion of this\nissue to section 2.3 of this entry. \nIn addition to developing an account of the mind–body union,\nAstell also maintains that the mind and body are “really\ndistinct.” As she had a social reason for developing her account\nof the mind–body union—namely, to argue against the popular\naccount of women’s nature—she also had a social reason for\nconstructing arguments about the real distinction between the mind and\nbody: by showing that the mind, unlike the body, is immortal, she can\nillustrate to people, especially those who believe in the existence of\nGod, how God’s existence is important to them (Astell 1705, CR\n246–247 [section 256]). \nIn presenting this account of the real distinction between the mind\nand body in Christian Religion, Astell demonstrates first that\nthe mind is immaterial and then that it is immortal. She maintains\nthat the mind is immaterial in that it has no parts, and so is\nindivisible. Given that it is indivisible, it is incorruptible, and so\nimmortal (Astell 1705, 247 [section 257]). Having ruled out the natural\nannihilation of minds, Astell turns to the question of whether God\nwould supernaturally annihilate them. She argues that he would not, for\nGod does nothing in vain, thus he would not create something only to\nannihilate it (Astell 1705, 248–249 [section 257–258]). \nWithin her discussion about the immortality of minds, Astell\ncontrasts minds with bodies, and different kinds of bodies with each\nother. Unlike minds, human bodies and other physical objects have\nparts, and so are corruptible. Such bodies differ from the particles\nthat make them up, which do not corrupt: \nHere Astell embraces a view according to which physical objects and\nhuman bodies are not ‘beings’ in the same sense that particles of\nbodies are. In the next passage, she also reveals her view about the\nindividuality of physical objects: their ‘being’ is based on\nappearances, not anything intrinsic within the objects themselves: \nIn the next passages, Astell presents a proof of the real\ndistinction between the mind and body. Her argument is similar to\nDescartes’s insofar as she maintains that the nature of the mind\nis thought and the nature of the body is extension (Astell 1705,\n249–252 [sections 259–261]). (See Atherton, 1993, for a\ndiscussion of Astell’s account of thought as the nature of the\nmind.) In the sections that follow these, she uses her account of the\nreal distinction between the mind and body to formulate a critique of\nLocke’s view about the possibility of thinking matter. Bryson\n(1988), Squadrito (1987; 1991), Taylor (2001), O’Neill (1998a,\n528–529), and Broad (2002a, 151–153) discuss these\narguments in detail. \nIn Letters Concerning the Love of God, Astell and John\nNorris debate occasionalist and Cambridge Platonist accounts of the\nrelation between God and his creation. (See Wilson, 2004, for a\ndetailed discussion of this text.) The central issue at stake is the\nclaim made by Norris in Practical Discourses upon Several Divine\nSubjects (1693) that we should love God because he alone is the\nsource of our sensation, and so the source of our pleasure, and so the\nsource of our good. Astell objects: our reason for loving God should\nnot depend on the occasionalist tenet about God’s direct causal\nrole in the universe. The issues in their discussion are the extent of\nGod’s causal role in creation, the causal powers of physical\nobjects, the workings of human sense perception, the mind–body\nunion, and the ways humans can and should love God and his\ncreation. \nAstell and Norris agree on an account of human love, holding that\nas bodies have motion so minds have love. A remnant of this parallel\nis still with us in the twenty-first century, for we say metaphorically\nthat we are “moved” when we experience a shift in our\nemotions toward a kind of tenderness. Broad notes that Astell and\nNorris also agree that there are two basic kinds of love and that they are\ndifferentiated in part with respect to the objects on which the love is\nfocused. On the one hand, creatures deserve “benevolence,”\nwhich is marked by its disinterestedness and motivated by altruism and\ncharity; created things, after all, lack the causal power to ultimately\nsatisfy the desires of other created beings. On the other hand, God\nmerits “desire,” which is a love of something as our good.\nUltimately, he is the only one who has the causal power to ultimately\nsatisfy our desires. God does not need our benevolence, for he cannot\nlack anything that we could give him (Broad 2002a, 119–120). \nAstell and Norris’s shared views on love relate to their views on\ncausality. Occasionalists and Cambridge Platonists developed accounts\nof causality in order to remedy a purported problem with Descartes’s\nontology. According to Descartes, God created two different kinds of\nsubstances—mental and corporeal—that, on the one hand, are\n“really distinct” from each other in virtue of their\nessences, and, on the other hand, are sometimes united to form\nmind–body unions. When so united, minds and bodies interact with\neach other, for instance during sensation. The purported problem is\nthis: how can two substances that have completely different\nessences—essences that render them “really distinct”\nsubstances—interact with each other? \nWith an eye toward resolving this problem, Cambridge Platonists\nretained an account of the interaction between the mind and body, and\npresented a quite different interpretation of the number and nature of\nsubstances that exist. Henry More, for example, maintained that, in\naddition to the souls of God and living creatures, there is the\n“Spirit of Nature,” which is the causal agent that allows\nhuman minds and bodies to interact. \nThe occasionalist philosophers resolved the problem another way:\nthey agreed with Descartes that the mind and body are really distinct\nbecause of their quite different natures, but they denied that there is\nany interaction between them. Instead, they maintained that God\norchestrates a harmonious correlation between events of the mind and\nevents of the body, and he is the efficient (and so direct) cause of\nhuman sensations. \nThroughout Letters, Norris defends his occasionalism against\nAstell’s critiques, which were based on Cambridge Platonist views\nabout the nature of the mind–body union. In the\nappendix—written after Norris convinced Astell to allow him to\npublish the letters as a volume—Astell presents two final\ncriticisms of Norris’s account. First, occasionalism makes much of\nGod’s creation vain: if God is the efficient cause of all of our sense\nperceptions, then his creation of material objects is superfluous, for\nthey play no direct role in our sense perceptions (Astell, Norris\n1695, 278–80). Second, occasionalism offends God’s majesty, for\naccording to it he repeatedly interferes in creation in order to move\nbodies and create mental events. (Astell, Norris 1695, 278).  See\nO’Neill (2007) for a history of these arguments in St. Thomas’\ncritiques of medieval Islamic occasionalists. \nAstell’s own view about the causation of sensation involves an account\nof a “sensible congruity” between features of external\nbodies and powers of the soul that are employed in sensations. For\ndiscussions of her account, as well as arguments about whether its\nroots are in Descartes, Malebranche, or Norris, see Acworth (1979,\n174, 178), Taylor (2001, 511–2), Broad (2002a, 109), and O’Neill\n(2007). \nAstell develops three themes common to rationalism: an emphasis of the\nmind over the body; a theory of innate ideas as the origin of\nknowledge; and a methodology that leads the novice from confusion to\nclarity. In the section above on metaphysics, I addressed\nAstell’s emphasis of the mind over body. In this section I will\nreconstruct her accounts of mind, ideas, knowledge, belief, and\nmethod. \nAstell holds that the mind has two faculties: the understanding and\nthe will. The understanding is the capacity to receive and compare\nideas, and the will is the power of preferring and directing thoughts\nand motions (Astell 2002, 205). Each faculty has a proper object: the\nproper object of the understanding is truth, which has “being\nfrom Eternity in the Divine Ideas” (Astell 2002, 137); the\nproper object of the will is the good, which is God’s will\n(Astell 2002, 206). When the understanding is healthy, it has\nknowledge (Astell 2002, 130); when the will is healthy, it is\nregular—that is, it is guided by the understanding (Astell\n2002,205, 209). The task of the understanding is to govern the will\n(Astell 2002, 130).  \nAstell holds a nativism according to which there are not merely innate\nideas, but also innate inclinations. She explains that the innate\nideas are “rudiments of knowledge” (Astell 2002, 128) that\nare “inseparable” from the understanding and are the\nsources of our other ideas (Astell 2002, 205). In addition, she states\nthat we are born with inclinations that are “inseparable”\nfrom the will (Astell 2002, 205).  She explains that our innate ideas\nmake us rational creatures.  Irrational creatures, on the other hand,\nact according to the will of God and by mechanism. But equipped with\nreason, humans are voluntary agents: we choose our actions according\nto principles in the understanding, and we determine our wills (Astell\n2002, 128). (For a further discussion of these passages, see Atherton\n1993, 29–35, and Sowaal 2007, 228–31.) \nAstell provides two accounts of ideas, one\ngeneral and one strict. In doing so, she presents her views on\nknowledge and clear and distinct perceptions. Here is the general\naccount of idea: \nIn the general sense ideas—the immediate objects of the\nmind—are required for knowledge. Here is the strict account of\nidea: \nIdeas in the strict sense represent what is distinct from the idea.\nAs such, ideas must be clear in order for them to afford knowledge. In\nthe following passage, Astell employs Descartes’s account of clear and\ndistinct perceptions from Principles of Philosophy, Part I,\nsection 45 (AT VIIIA 21–2; CSM I 207): \nAstell differs from Descartes, however, in maintaining that we have\nclear but not distinct (or perfect) ideas of God and souls. She holds\nthat though we can know some of the attributes of these substances, we\ncannot know their true natures (Astell 2002, 173). \nFor Astell, though ideas can be confused, they are not the sources of\nerror. Rather, Astell locates falsity and error in judgments, and\noften in language (Astell 2002, 169, 171). She holds that judgment\ninvolves the comparison of two ideas and that sometimes we lack an\n“intermediate idea” (a “middle term”) in order\nto make a judgment (Astell 2002, 146–7, 172–3). \nOn this view, we can avoid error in judgment when we are careful in\nseparating and uniting ideas; we can avoid equivocation in language\nwhen we only use words that have distinct ideas attached to them. To\ndo this kind of work, we need to first examine ideas about morality\nand religion, separating what we find through metaphysical reflection\nfrom what we have adopted by custom. Ultimately all reasonings and\ndeductions should begin from ideas that are clear and are “as\ndistinct as the nature of the subject will permit” (Astell 2002,\n169–72). \nAstell does not hold a “traditional” account of knowledge\nas true, justified belief. Rather, on her view knowledge and belief\nare ideas that are distinguished by origin, clarity, distinctness, and\nthe means by which they are affirmed. What follows is a reconstruction\nof her discussion of these issues in Serious Proposal\n(Astell 2002, 146–153). \nGiven the finitude of the human mind, it is limited with respect to\nits reach, and it is diverse in its modes of thinking. Astell states the\nfollowing about the reach of the mind: \nAbout the modes of thinking, she writes: \nIn addition to faith, science, and opinion, Astell also discusses\nmoral certainty and sensation. She notes that sensation is not so much\na mode of knowledge as it is a kind of being conscious (Astell 2002,\n152). \nAstell’s account of the modes of thinking is related to her view\nabout how we come to hold truths, of which there are two ways. The\nfirst is marked by passivity: some truths are delivered to us. They\ncan be delivered to us by our own understandings, that is, by\nintuition; or they can be delivered to us by authority. When truths\nare delivered by intuition, we have ideas that are clear and distinct,\nself-evident, indubitable, compel the will, and serve as first\nprinciples. When they are delivered by authority they are dubitable,\nconfused, and lack self-evidence. The second way we come to hold\ntruths is marked by activity: such truths are drawn by demonstration\nfrom other truths. \nScience is our mode of thinking when we intuit a truth and when we\nhold that truth because we have derived it (by reasoning and\ndeduction) from an intuition. In the latter case, we hold\n“objects of science.” In both cases, we have\n“knowledge.” \nFaith is our mode of thinking when we hold a truth given to us by\nauthority and when we derive additional truths from such truths. In\nboth cases we hold “objects of faith” and we have\n“belief.” \n“Moral certainty” is our mode of thinking when we draw\nideas by demonstration from premises that are a mix of knowledge and\nbelief; “opinion” is our mode of thinking when we hold\nideas drawn either by bad argument or by an argument in which confused\nideas serve as premises. \nIdeas attained through intuition are the highest form of knowledge.\nThese ideas are clear and distinct, self-evident, and indubitable;\nfurther, these ideas compel the will. The “objects of\nscience” that are derived by demonstration from intuitions have\na very high epistemic status and command a firm assent. Though Astell\nmaintains that all beliefs are dubitable, as they lack self-evidence\nas well as clarity and distinctness, she holds that objects of faith\ncan share the elevated epistemic status maintained by intuitions and\nobjects of science: \nFor Astell, the will, which is involved whenever we hold a truth, is\nmoved in different ways depending on the situation and the kind of\ntruth involved. When we hold a self-evident truth, our wills are\ncompelled by the clarity and distinctness of the idea: we\n“see” the truth so clearly and distinctly that we cannot\ndoubt it; that is, we cannot but assent to it. On the other hand, when\na truth is delivered to us from an authority, and we do not have a\nclear and distinct perception of the truth, then our wills are not\ncompelled by the idea. In such cases, if we are to affirm the idea, we\nmust move our wills ourselves. What is striking about Astell’s view is\nthat she maintains that we are as certain when we move our wills to\naffirm objects of faith as when our wills are compelled to affirm\nintuitions and objects of science. \nHowever, this is not to say that we should intentionally move our\nwills to affirm truths about which we can have clear and\ndistinct ideas when we do not currently have such clear and distinct\nideas. That is, those truths that are candidates for knowledge\n(intuitions or objects of science) should known and not merely\nbelieved. This is especially true with respect to what she calls\n“the ideas of the philosophers”: \nThis connects to Astell’s view on wisdom: “to Know what is to be\nKnown, and to Believe what is to be Believ’d is the property of\na Wise person” (Astell 2002, 152). It also provides one of the\ntheoretical bases for Astell’s views on education. \nOne thread running throughout rationalism is the coupling of an\nanalysis of what prevents the novice from having knowledge with the\ndevelopment of a method to lead the novice from confusion to knowledge\n(see Nelson 2005). For example, Plato explains how the body confuses\nthe soul, and he illustrates how the dialectic can lead his\ninterlocutor to grasp the forms. Descartes agrees with Plato about the\nbody’s confusion of the soul, adding that scholastic teachings lead to\nfurther confusion, especially in that they reinforce childhood\nprejudice, which is rooted in an overemphasis on the senses. His\nfamous method of doubt is one instantiation of his general account of\nmethod, encapsulated in the four rules he presents in Part II\nof Discourse on the Method (AT VI 18–9; CSM I\n20). In Discourse on the Method and Meditations on First\nPhilosophy, the meditator utilizes the method of doubt so she can\nmove from confusion and obscurity to clarity and distinctness. \nAstell, too, provides an explanation of the novice’s initial confusion\nand offers a method that can be employed to resolve the\ncondition. Astell’s position on these issues is especially interesting\nin that she examines the female novice, theorizing an explanation of\nwhat is specific about her initial confusion and constructing a method\ntailored specifically for her. \nAs Astell sees it, the problem that faces the female novice is that\nshe has a diseased mind as the result of social conditioning. This\ndiseased mind manifests in part as a particular skeptical predicament:\nshe has a radical doubt about her nature, for she believes God made\nher with a degraded reason. That is, she adopts the prejudice that she\nis incapable of improvement because she is naturally proud and vain\n(Astell 2002, 58, 62). Gripped with this skeptical predicament, she\nhas no desire to improve her mind, and she lacks an ability to\nunderstand her perfections, which would otherwise guide her in living\na virtuous life (Astell 2002, 80–1, 200, 202, 228). \nAnother way Astell frames the problem facing women is in terms of an\naccount of the passions. She maintains that women, like men, are born\nwith both generosity and a striving for perfection.  Though Astell\ndoes not say what she means by the term ‘generosity’, I\nwill assume she is using the term in the Cartesian sense. Descartes\nwrites: \nRoughly, a person has generosity when she realizes that she is merely\nher will and she has the resolution to use it well. For Descartes,\ngenerosity is both a passion and a virtue. It is the keystone passion\nin that when one has it, one does not have vices. This is so because\nvices rest on a misunderstanding of what one is and what one’s goods\nare. \nAstell explains that because women are not provided with rich\nmetaphysical educations they do not develop the knowledge of what they\ntruly are (their wills), nor do they develop the resolution to use\ntheir wills well. Instead, they focus on creating physical perfection\nand also on the praises that accompany it. Thus they develop vanity\nand pride, the “feminine vices” (Astell 2002,\n62–64).  Ultimately, women’s salvation is at stake: \nAstell’s overall project with respect to education is designed to\naddress this problem of salvation. If a woman does not learn to\nseparate her mind from her body while on earth—that is, if she\ndoes not learn to perfect her rational capacities by forming clear and\ndistinct perceptions, thereby polishing her innate ideas and ordering\nthem correctly—she will not be able to separate her mind from\nher body when she dies, and so her soul will not reach heaven. In this\nway Astell’s rationalist education remedies a very practical problem\nof the individuation of the body and soul at death. This elucidates\nthe kind of education Astell promotes: it is not preparation for a\ncareer as a doctor, lawyer, curate, or scientist, nor is it the\nprecursor to what we today call a “liberal education”;\ninstead it is an education that teaches women how to cultivate\nintellectual enjoyment and perfection, and ultimately generosity and\nvirtue. \nAstell recognizes that women need to employ a method to aid them in\nthis metaphysical education. Women, especially those of the gentry,\nhave been raised to be idle and to concern themselves with frivolous\nthings. When they seek to better themselves, they do not know how and\nare quickly discouraged: “they want [lack] the method of doing\nit; they know not how to look into their Souls, or if they do, they\nfind so many disorders to be rectified, so many wants to be supplied,\nthat frightened with the difficulty of the world they lay aside the\nthoughts of undertaking it” (Astell 2002, 124). Astell suggests\nto women six rules that will aid them in their metaphysical\nreflections (Astell 2002, 176–9). \nLike many of Astell’s views and distinctions, these rules are ripe for\ncomparison with Descartes’s, as well as with those presented by\nArnauld and Nicole. Indeed, these rules are part of Astell’s version\nof Arnauld and Nicole’s Port-Royal Logic, which she designs\nspecifically for women so that they can escape their everyday\nskepticism; only once they resolve their skeptical predicaments can\nthey begin to embark on a project of reflection involving\nphilosophical skepticism, as Descartes presents it in Discourse on\nthe Method and Meditations on First Philosophy (see\nSowaal 2007). \nThe method encapsulated in these six rules is to be employed when a\nmeditator addresses a particular subject of inquiry. But even prior to\nsuch reflections, Astell recognizes that the female meditator must\nfirst disengage from the skeptical predicament. Women should learn to\nmaintain beliefs because they are self-evident, not because they once\nheld them. To do so, Astell suggests a number of strategies. One is\nreflecting on how the former prejudices led to mischief, promoted\nerror, and hindered the free range of thought. Further, one should\nreflect on how the prejudices provided a means for skepticism to take\nroot. For example, when one holds a belief, one often draws further\nconclusions from it. But when one finds that the conclusion is false,\none often questions the whole group of claims, concluding that nothing\ncan be known (Astell 2002, 133–4). Here Astell’s treatment is\nlargely Cartesian. \nHowever, Astell departs from a Cartesian project when she presents\nanother strategy the female meditator can use to release herself from\nthe skeptical predicament, one that involves reflection on\nteleological arguments about the design of God’s creation (Astell\n2002, 153–4, 168). These arguments are designed to help the novice\nrealize that God would not have created her so that she is naturally\ndefective, (naturally proud, vain, and unimprovable). Such reflection\nwill lead the novice to search for the perfections God has bestowed\nupon her and the role they play in her life, as well as in her\ncommunity and creation as a whole. Through these considerations, she\nwill be drawn to the conclusion that she is a rational being who can\nand ought to improve her rationality in order to fulfill God’s plan\nfor creation. \nUltimately the female novice will benefit from metaphysical reflection\non what truly exists—God, mind, and body—for such\nreflection will result in her correctly understanding what she is and\nhow she stands in relation to God. A central aspect of this will be\nher new comprehension of the understanding, the will, and the origin\nof error. She will come to grasp that the limitation of the\nunderstanding is not a defect, it is natural and necessary; thus,\nwhile ignorance cannot be avoided, error can. She will realize that\nthe understanding is passive and that judgment—and therefore\nerror—belongs to the will. She will learn to suspend her\njudgment until she has clarity and to direct her will to a good end\n(Astell 2002, 159). With this new understanding of her will and her\nnew resolution to develop better habits in employing her will, her\ngenerosity (which formerly degraded into pride, vanity) will be\nrestored, as will her virtue.","contact.mail":"asowaal@sfsu.edu","contact.domain":"sfsu.edu"}]
