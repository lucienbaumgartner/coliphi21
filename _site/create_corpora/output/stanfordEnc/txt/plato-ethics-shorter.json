Works in this group shows stylistic as well\nas philosophic affinities and are generally considered to have been\nwritten early in Plato’s career. The dialogues in this group are our\nmain source for the philosophical style and teaching of the Platonic\nSocrates, who is thought by some scholars to be to a reasonable\napproximation of the historical figure. In this article,\n“Socrates” always refers to the Platonic figure in the\nworks under discussion here.\n\n\n\nSections 2 through 9 concern philosophical themes that are common to\nthe works under discussion.  Section 10 deals with the intellectual\nworld that Plato uses as a backdrop for these dialogues.  Sections 11\nto 20 deal with the individual dialogues of the group.\n\n\n\nAt the center of Plato’s shorter ethical works is \n the Apology of Socrates, \n which consists of a speech purportedly given by Socrates at his\ntrial, and is probably the closest of Plato’s works to the historical\nSocrates. The Apology is closely linked to two other\nworks. The first is\n the Euthyphro, \n which shows Socrates discussing reverence as he is about to report to\ncourt for his indictment, an indictment that includes by implication a charge of\nirreverence. The second is \n the Crito, \n which shows Socrates in prison on the day before his execution,\ndefending his decision to accept the penalty rather than corrupt the\nlaw by bribing his way out of prison and away from Athens.\nThe Crito argument depends on a principle that is the bedrock\nof Socratic ethics: that it is never right to do wrong, even in return\nfor wrong (49ab). The bedrock principle rules out the view that one\nshould do right by one’s friends and wrong by one’s enemies, a view\nthat had roots in Greek tradition. \n\nFour of the dialogues in this group are concerned \n with definition \n of virtues or good qualities, especially virtues:\n Euthyphro \n (piety or reverence), Laches (courage),\n Charmides (temperance or soundness of mind), \n and Hippias Major \n (the fine or beautiful). These dialogues of definition indirectly\nraise questions about the mutual relations of the virtues, and this\nquestion is taken up explicitly in the\n Protagoras,\n which introduces the doctrines of \n the unity of virtue \n and the impossibility of acrasia (the\ndoctrine that it is impossible to know what is right and still do\nwrong). A corollary of this is the claim that no one does wrong\nwillingly, which supports part of Socrates’ argument in the\nApology. Another corollary is that in seeking virtue we\nshould seek knowledge about virtue. Nevertheless, Socrates entertains\nstrong doubts as to the teachability of virtue. Socrates sometimes\ntreats virtue on the analogy \n of techne,\n however, and techne means a body of specialized knowledge\nthat can be taught. \n\nAside from the Apology and Crito, which contain\nextended speeches, the most prominent feature of these works is\nSocrates’ use of questions calling for short answers. Although\nSocrates uses this style of conversation for a number of different\npurposes, it has been called the Socratic method, and in one of its\nforms is has become known to scholars as \n the elenchus. \n\nFour dialogues in the group show Socrates in contrast \n to sophists,\n who were paid teachers of subjects ranging from \n rhetoric  \n to mathematics. Some sophists claimed expertise on virtue, and\nSocrates took it as part of his mission to investigate such\nclaims. The Protagoras treats its eponymous sophist \nwith some respect, but the two Hippias \n dialogues (major and minor) \n poke fun at their namesake, and \n the Euthydemus \n shows its sophists as puzzle-makers who cannot make good their claim\nto teach virtue. \nFollowing the lead of Vlastos (1971 and 1992), many scholars represent\nthe philosophical content of these dialogues as teachings of Socrates.\nThis article follows that convention.  On Socrates, see Benson 1992,\nBrickhouse and Smith 2000, Rappe and Kamtekar 2005, Rudebusch 2009,\nand Bussanich and Smith (eds.) 2013.  On Socrates’ ethical theory, see\nthe first half of Irwin 1995. \n\nThe general rules of elenchus are these: Socrates’ partner\n(often called his interlocutor) must answer every question according\nto his own beliefs, and the partner (not the audience if there is one)\njudges the outcome. Socrates’ questions start from his partner’s\ninitial statement, which usually implies a claim to wisdom or to\nknowledge of a subject related to virtue.  Sometimes Socrates seeks\nclarification of the claim; at other times he proceeds directly to\nelicit his partner’s agreement to premises that will turn out to be\ninconsistent with the initial claim. In some cases, the premises have\nno authority aside from the partner’s agreement; in others, Socrates\nprovides an argument for premises, usually in the form of an\nepagoge, a general inference from a set of examples. An\nelenchus usually concludes in the discomfiture of the partner, who now\nappears unable to support his initial statement.  Some form of\nelenchus is probably responsible for Socrates’ claim in the\nApology that he has demonstrated that every claimant to\nwisdom whom he has examined has failed the test (21b–23b). In the\ndialogues of this group, the elenchus is a negative\ninstrument, but in the Gorgias Socrates seems to use it in\nsupport of \n his bedrock principle that one should never commit injustice, the principle he uses in his argument in Crito. \n In some cases, an elenchus seems only to discredit a person; in\nothers it refutes a position that is under discussion. In those cases,\nit points the dialogue that contains it toward\naporia—an impasse.  Socrates applied the method to\nchallenge views he probably held himself (as we shall see in\nthe Laches), and he implies in the Hippias Major\nthat he has used elenchus to prevent his being complacent\nwith his own ignorance (304c–e). \n\nThe philosophical puzzle of the elenchus is to see how it\ncould lead to any firm result, if its premises have no authority\nbeyond the partner’s agreement. Perhaps the method can do no more than\nconvict a partner of confusion (as Hugh Benson has contended), but\nVlastos has argued persuasively that elenchus in fact supports\nSocrates’ ethical doctrine: Socrates believes he has grounds for\nclinging to beliefs of his that have been well tested and not\nrefuted. \n\nOn the elenchus, see especially Vlastos 1983, Kraut 1983, Brickhouse\nand Smith 1984, Benson 1987, and Tarrant 2005. \n\nWhen Socrates asks a question such as “What is\nreverence?” he has in mind a question that can be answered only\nin certain ways. To begin with, he will not be satisfied with an\nanswer that points only to a certain kind of reverence, or only to an\nexample of reverence. The answer must identify a feature that (1)\nbelongs to every kind of reverence (generality requirement), and (2)\nto nothing that is not reverent (exclusion requirement), and (3) has\nexplanatory power. \n\nThe first two requirements appear in many texts, but the third\nemerges most clearly in the \n Euthyphro. \n The Euthyphro seems to require that a definition state the\nessence (ousia) of the thing being defined, by contrast with\na statement of that thing’s non-essential attributes (pathe);\nsuch a statement could be true without qualifying as a definition. The\nstatement “reverence is what all the gods love” states\nonly a pathos, because it does not explain what makes\nsomething reverent. We are left to speculate about what would count as\nstating the essence of reverence; probably it would state what makes\nthings reverent in the way that having three straight sides and three\nangles makes a plane figure a triangle, while giving delight to\ngeometers does not. Clarification for the explanation requirement\ncomes from a further requirement, that the explanatory cause of\nXness must be always X (the synonymy\nrequirement). Hence Socrates rejects answers to “What is the\nfine?” that identify entities that are not reliably fine\n(e.g. Hippias Major 289b;cf. Phaedo 105d). \n\nScholarly opinion is divided as to whether Socrates is satisfied with\nany of the definitions of virtues that he considers. Mastery of\ndefinitions would be sufficient for the expert knowledge of virtue\nthat Socrates disclaims, so either he lacks that mastery or his\ndisclaimer is (as some scholars believe) ironic. \n\nOn Socratic definition, see Vlastos 1976, Nehamas 1975, Benson\n1990, and Futter 2011. \n\nSocrates seems to assume in these works that knowledge of definitions\nhas priority in two ways: (1) One must know what reverence is before\none could know of any particular action that it is reverent (whether,\nfor example, it is reverent to prosecute one’s father), and so for the\nother virtues and other cases. (2) One must know what reverence is\nbefore one could know what properties reverence has (for\nexample, whether it is teachable). The first of these has been attacked as the\nSocratic fallacy by Peter Geach; Socrates himself thinks he knows\nthings for which he appears to be unable to give\ndefinitions. Luckily, no text unequivocally assigns either claim to\nSocrates, and the matter is under debate. A charitable view would\nassign to Socrates in place of (1) the view that only expert knowledge on\nthe model of techne requires the ability to\ngive definitions, and in place of (2) the view that we cannot know\nwhat the essential features of something are until we know its\nessence. \n\nSocrates nevertheless has strong opinions about virtues, opinions that\nguide his search for definitions—for example, that courage is\nnoble or fine (Laches 193d) and that we should pursue virtue above\nall else. It is one thing to aim at virtue and still another to be\nable to determine what actions virtue requires, as Vasiliou contends.\nBut if Socrates thinks he lacks mastery of definitions of virtues,\nthen we must ask how he thinks he can be right enough about the\nvirtues even to look for their definitions. This puzzle is taken up to\nsome extent in the Meno. \n\nOn priority of definition, see Benson 2000 and 2013, Wolfsdorf 2004, and\nVasiliou 2008.  For the view that it is wisdom that is prior, see Pangle 2014.   \n\n“Virtue” translates arete, which Socrates’\ncontemporaries used of any sort of excellence that leads to success. A\nnumber of writers before Socrates had used the word and its associated\nvocabulary primarily in ethical contexts. But Socrates was probably\nthe first to identify ethical virtue with what is analogous in the\nsoul to health. \n\nIn Socrates’ usage, virtue is the ability to do what is right and\nresist doing what is wrong. As we learn especially from the\nCrito, Socrates holds that wrong actions harm one’s\ncharacter, which he identifies in other dialogues as the soul.\nBecause the soul is more important to us than the body, we should care\nabout nothing so much as virtue, and Socrates understands his role in\nAthens as that of shaming Athenians into taking this most important\nconcern seriously through the care of the soul (29e–30a). \nIn inquiring after the virtues, Socrates assumes that they have some\nstatus as entities, especially in Euthyphro and Hippies\nMajor. Some scholars have thought this assumption represented an\nearly theory of Platonic forms (Allen 1970; see also Prior 2013 and\nWoodruff forthcoming.  \n\nThe principal virtues of interest to Socrates in this group of\ndialogues are courage (andreia), reverence or piety\n(eusebeia, to hosion), wisdom (sophia),\ntemperance or sound-mindedness (sophrosune), and justice\n(dikaiosune). \n\nThese dialogues raise two general questions about virtues that are\nimportant to ethical theory, one concerning instrumentality and\nanother concerning unity. They also raise a question about the analogy\nbetween virtue and expert knowledge (techne). \n\nAre virtues instrumental for other goods, or are they good in\nthemselves? If they are instrumental, are they instrumental in respect\nof themselves, by causing virtue to grow in the holders of virtue and\nin those on whom they have influence? Or are they instrumental in\nhelping us procure external goods for ourselves? On the\ninstrumentality of virtue there was an important dispute between\nVlastos and Irwin. \n\nIn a famous passage in Republic 1, which has some affinities\nwith dialogues of our group, a sophist named Thrasymachus challenges\nSocrates to define justice without saying (as he was apparently known\nfor doing) that justice is the beneficial or the advantageous\n(336d). Instead, Thrasymachus insists on the precision that specifies\nwho receives the benefit or advantage of justice; in Thrasymachus’\nview it is the rulers who reap the benefits, while those who are ruled\npay a heavy price. Socrates defends the use of terms such as\n“beneficial” in defining justice, implying that he would\naccept some sort of instrumental view, but he plainly holds that\njustice is beneficial to everyone who is touched by it. This is the\nmain theme of the Republic, but it also resonates with the\nshorter ethical dialogues, as we shall see. The ending of \n the Hippias Major \n bears on the problem of instrumentality through a discussion of the\nbeneficial as replicating its own goodness (as virtue engenders\nvirtue). Socrates appears to be the first to make eudaemonia (happiness, the good life) a goal in ethics. On the relation between virtue and happiness in Socrates’ thought, see Reshotko 2013 \n\nSocrates argues in the Protagoras for the unity of virtues, a\nthesis that has been variously interpreted and may be supported by\nother dialogues in this group. Vlastos famously explained the thesis\nas bi-conditional: that whoever has one virtue has them all. Others\n(Penner, Woodruff) have argued for a stronger thesis, such that the\ndefinitions of all the virtues would have a common essence. Dialogues\nof definition, such as the Laches, seem to presuppose that\neach virtue has its own definition, but, at the same time, such\ndialogues seem to be moving towards the view that the essence of each\nvirtue is wisdom or knowledge. The Protagoras defines courage\nas the knowledge of what is and is not to be feared (360d), but the\nLaches rejects a similar definition on the grounds that it\ndoes not differentiate courage adequately from other virtues\n(199e). And the Euthyphro ends in aporia (at an\nimpasse) because Socrates is unable to differentiate reverence\nadequately from justice. Efforts to define sound mindedness\n(sophrosune) in the Charmides end in an impasse\npartly owing to the difficulty of specifying the subject of the\nknowledge that is the essence of this virtue. If (as seems the case)\nSocrates is never satisfied with a definition of a virtue, this may be\nbecause the virtues cannot be differentiated at all. \n\nOn the unity of virtue, see especially Vlastos 1972 and 1994, Penner\n1973, Woodruff 1977, and Rudebusch 2017. \n\nTechne is, at the most basic level, what can be learned and\ntaught. The word is usually used for a body of professional knowledge,\nmastered by experts on whom laypeople may safely rely. It is often\ntranslated “art” or “craft” or\n“skill,” but in these pages it will be rendered\n“expert knowledge.” Navigation and medicine are frequent\nexamples of expert knowledge. To establish your credentials in expert\nknowledge, you should be able to identify your teachers and students\n(Laches 185b), as well as the specific field of your\nexpertise, which you must have mastered as a whole (e.g., Ion\n532b, ff.). You should also, ideally, be able to give an account of\nthe aim of your profession (e.g. health for medicine, Laches\n190a, cf. Gorgias 465a). Expert knowledge must be rational in\nits ability to account for what it does. \n\nSocrates seems to inquire after virtue as if it were, or at least\nresembled, the expert knowledge of living well, or the expert\nknowledge of care for the soul. If so, this knowledge could be taught\nand learned. Yet Socrates has grave doubts as to whether virtue can be\ntaught (Protagoras 319a, ff.). \n\nIf Socrates takes virtue to be a kind of knowledge, then he holds a view known as intellectualism. Does Socrates, or does he not, believe that virtue is to be understood\non the analogy with expert knowledge? If he believes that virtue is\ninstrumental to happiness (as some scholars hold), then he might well\nbelieve that virtue is a kind of practical knowledge, and the analogy\nwould be helpful. If he believes (as other scholars hold) that virtue is\nat least partly constitutive of happiness, then the analogy seems\nmisleading, since bodies of expert knowledge are generally valued\nas merely instrumental for their goals. If Socrates does not subscribe to the\nanalogy, however, why does he use it in argument?  He uses it in\nargument in the context of the larger question whether virtue can be\ntaught, probably on the assumption that, if it can be taught, it can\nbe taught as expert knowledge is taught. But Socrates questions whether it can be taught\nat all. The\n Meno \n will explore a process of learning without teaching; this process is\nknown as recollection. \n\nThe word sophia bridges a gap; usually translated\n“wisdom,” it may be used as a rough synonym for\ntechne, but it may also be used for less specific forms of\nwisdom that are not obviously taught or learned and may lack the\nrational features of expert knowledge. When experts fail at tasks related to their expertise, Socrates naturally attribute the failure to a lack of knowledge; if he does so in the case of virtue, he commits himself to the view that no one can do wrong in full knowledge; on this see the next section. \n\nOn techne and the techne\nanalogy, see Irwin 1995.  For a skeptical view of Socrates’ commitment\nto techne, see Roochnik 1996 and 2002. On the issue of Socrates’ intellectualism, see Brickhouse and Smith 2013.  \n\nSocrates’ doctrine on this, apparently, is that knowledge of what is\nright cannot be overcome by pleasure or passion. After Aristotle,\nphilosophers have termed this the issue of acrasia.\nAcrasia, weakness of will, would occur when someone who knows\nwhat is right does what is wrong under the influence of passion or in\norder to secure pleasure. \n\nHolders of expert knowledge are supposed to be reliable in the\nexercise of that knowledge; they are professionals, and part of their\nprofessionalism is to ply their trade competently regardless of the\nweight of passion or the blandishments of pleasure. So\nthe techne analogy might be construed to imply the\nimpossibility of acrasia.  Socrates’ argument for this in\nthe Protagoras, however, is based on his\ndemonstration that the popular explanation for weak-willed behavior\n(that knowledge is overcome by pleasure) is incoherent. Socrates is\nnot denying that people do wrong under the influence of passion or\ndesire for pleasure; he is rejecting the usual explanation for this,\nand denying that it occurs in the case of those who have the relevant knowledge.  Plainly, the\ndoctrine presupposes a stringent criterion for knowledge, at least as\ndemanding as the test for\ntechne. \n\nA related doctrine is that no one errs voluntarily, a doctrine Plato holds consistently from the Apology to the Laws. If\nacrasia is impossible, then every moral error involves a\ncognitive failure about the action or the principle that it violates,\nand cognitive errors negative (or at least weaken) responsibility for\nactions caused by those errors. Socrates generally assumes that\nactions taken in ignorance are involuntary, and that therefore the\nproper response to wrongdoing is not retribution, but education, as he\nsays in the Apology (25e–26a). \n\nIn the \n Hippias Minor, \n by contrast, Socrates argues that it is better to do wrong\nvoluntarily than in ignorance. Although he is unhappy with this\nconclusion, he gives no direct hints as to how to avoid it. \n\nOn acrasia see Segvic 2005 and Devereaux 2008. \n\nAristophanes depicted Socrates in the\nClouds (421 BCE) as a participant in the two revolutions that\nconstituted the new learning of the period, and these were both\nexciting and disturbing to ordinary Athenians. \n\nSophists.  The Fifth Century saw an explosion of\ninterest in traveling teachers, later known as sophists, who taught a number of subjects, including the art of words, later known as\nrhetoric. Although the art of words was widely used for entertainment,\nit also had applications in deliberative and forensic rhetoric, and\nthe sophists were accused of teaching their pupils how to win on\nbehalf of a bad cause—to make the worse argument into the\nstronger. Socrates is accused of this in the Clouds: a\nstudent emerges from his instruction with an argument that purports to\njustify a son’s whipping his father. \n\nClever techniques of argument were taught by some sophists, as were\nserious devices for the effective staging of adversary debate, on\nwhich the city-states of those periods depended, both for decisions\nabout policy and for verdicts in criminal cases. Some people felt that\nthese techniques corrupted political and legal processes. Plato took\npains to depict Socrates not only as different from the sophists, but\nas opposed to them on many points. This is a theme in several\ndialogues in our group: Euthydemus, Hippias Minor,\nHippias Major, and Protagoras. \n\nNatural scientists. Thinkers of the period were developing\nexplanations for natural phenomena that displaced the gods from their\ntraditional roles as causes. Again, Socrates is depicted in the\nClouds as involved in this sort of explanation. Again, Plato\ntakes pains in the Apology and later works to show that the mature Socrates is not interested in this\nproject (Phaedo 96a–d, Phaedrus 229c–e). \n\nUnique among Plato’s works, this is a formal speech. The aim of\nforensic rhetoric by a defendant is normally acquittal, but Socrates’\naim here seems to be to bring out the truth of his life, regardless of\nhow it affects the jury. Still, although he begins with the usual disclaimer of speech-craft, Socrates speaks artfully enough that the result could\nbe used to illustrate a textbook of rhetorical technique. \n\nThe official charge is that he corrupted the young men of Athens, and\nthat he introduced new gods; this implies the old charge from\nAristophanes Clouds, that Socrates replaced the gods with\nnaturalistic explanations, and that he corrupted the youth by teaching\nrhetoric, “to make the worse argument win.” Socrates\ndenies having taught anything, and disclaims any interest in natural\nscience or the teaching of rhetoric. \n\nHow, then, did he come under such suspicion? Socrates claims it is\nbecause he led a life that seemed strange to his compatriots, in\nfulfillment of his mission.  Socrates claims to have been given this\nmission by the god, evidently Apollo, and he identifies this mission\nwith his gadfly role of shaming people into sharing his quest for\nvirtue. He may have developed elenchus (which derives from a word for\nshame) for this purpose, but he has another purpose for elenchus as\nwell. Once the oracle declared that no one was wiser than he, Socrates\nhad set out to test the oracle’s meaning by examining all those who\nclaimed to be wise. Finding none who could pass the test, he concluded\nthat the meaning of the oracle was probably this: that true wisdom\nbelongs to the god, and no human being can be wiser than a person who\nis aware, as Socrates says he is, of his own inadequacy in wisdom. In\nkeeping with this result, Socrates is cautious in his philosophical\nclaims in the\nApology. On the subject of death, he presents himself as\nagnostic there, although other texts show him to have been committed to\nthe immortality of the soul. \n\nSome scholars have argued that Socrates’ defense is ironic.  On this see Leibowitz 2014.   \n\nIn the Crito Socrates states the doctrines most important to\nhis conception of the ethical life. He will give up his life rather\nthan compromise his ethics. His peers would all agree that life is not\nworth living with a badly deformed body; they should agree that life\nis even less worth living with the sort of deformation that is caused\nby acting wrongly.  Wrongdoing damages the soul; that is why Socrates\nbelieves we must strive to avoid wrongdoing at all costs. \n\nCrito, a wealthy Athenian friend of Socrates, has bribed the jailers\nand prepared means for Socrates to escape from Athens, but Socrates\nrefuses on the grounds that to do so would be to damage the laws\nwrongfully, and this violates his\n bedrock principle \n that one must never do wrong, even in return for a wrong. He applies\nthis principle, he says, using his old method of accepting the\nreasoning (logos) that seems best to him as he reasons about\nit (46b). The bedrock principle has guided his life so far, and it\nwould be absurd to give it up now merely because his circumstances\nhave changed (46b, 49ab). \n\nWhen Crito appeals to popular opinion on the matter, Socrates replies\nthat the only authority he would accept on the matter would be that of\nsomeone who is expert on the matter at hand, which is the effects of\ndoing right and doing wrong. Because these are analogous to the\neffects of health and disease on the body, Socrates is looking for an\nexpert on moral health and corruption, apparently for the soul. In the\nabsence of such an expert, however, he must make up his own mind. His\nargument at this stage is highly condensed, leading to a question\nCrito cannot answer: One should abide by one’s agreements\nprovided they are just; would I be abiding by my agreement if I\nescaped without persuading the city (49e–50a)? \n\nBecause Crito cannot answer, Socrates personifies the laws and\nimagines their response, on behalf of his obligation to them. (Here as\nelsewhere, with the exception of the Apology, Socrates avoids\ngiving an extensive speech in his own persona.) The argument the laws give\nis elaborate, and appeals mainly to two points: an agreement they\nallege Socrates made to obey them by choosing to live in Athens, and\nthe benefits they claim Socrates has received from them, which place\nSocrates under a stronger obligation to the laws than he has to his\nparents. Neither Crito nor Socrates can reply to the arguments given\nby the laws, and their conclusion is allowed to stand. \n\nThe conclusion of these personified laws—that one must obey the\ncity in all things (51bc)—seems to conflict with a memorable\ntext in the Apology, as Grote first pointed out; there\nSocrates promises to disobey the court if it should let him off on the\ncondition that he give up his mission in Athens (29d). Scholarly\nopinions differ over how to reconcile these texts.   \n\nA dialogue of definition, the Euthyphro takes up the subject\nof reverence or piety, a virtue that traditionally bears on the\nkeeping of oaths, the treatment of the weak (such as prisoners and\nsuppliants), family relationships, and respect toward the gods. The\ndiscussion here lifts reverence out of its traditional context, while\nmarking sharply the difference between reasoning about ethics and\naccepting authority and implying support for \n the unity of virtue. \n\nSocrates is on his way to answer the indictment against him; Euthyphro\nis apparently a well-known crank on religious matters; his name\nironically means “straight-thinker.” He has just lodged a\ncharge against his father for the accidental death of a servant\naccused of murder. Most Athenians would probably have been shocked by\nthe irreverence of Euthyphro’s prosecution of his father, but\nEuthyphro is confident he is doing the right thing. His confidence\nrests on the special knowledge he claims on the subject of\nreverence. \n\nSocrates presupposes that such special knowledge implies knowledge of\nthe definition of reverence. If Euthyphro knows what reverence is, he\nshould teach that to Socrates, so that Socrates may use the knowledge\nin defense during his own trial. Euthyphro’s first two answers fail\nthe first two conditions of Socratic definition; the\nfirst is not general (“what I am doing now”—6d), and\nthe second (being loved by a god) would make the same things both\nreverent and irreverent; one god’s love would make an action reverent,\nwhile another god’s hate would make the same action irreverent\n(8ab). Socrates helps Euthyphro to a better answer (reverence is what\nis loved by all the gods), but this succumbs to the requirement that a\ndefinition state the essence of its subject (11ab). The essence of\nreverence cannot be conferred on reverent actions by the gods’\napproval of them; their approval, rather, must follow on their\npartaking of the essential nature of reverence. So actions are made\nreverent not by pleasing a god, but by satisfying the definition of\nreverence—or so most modern readers have inferred. \n\nSocrates then explores the\nidea that reverence is a proper part of justice, without finding a way\nto specify what part it is. Attempts to differentiate reverence from\njustice by appeal to the gods lead back to the better answer that was\nrefuted earlier. The conclusion is aporia (impasse); many\nscholars believe that it points to a theoretical point, a component of\nSocrates’ doctrine of the unity of virtue. There is no way to differentiate\nreverence from justice in a definition, because there is no essential difference between them;\nreverence is simply justice described with reference to the love that\nthe gods bear for justice. Other scholars have held that Socratic reverence is the specific duty we have to the gods that we cultivate all of virtue in our souls, as suggested by Socrates’ claim in the Apology that his mission was given him by the god (Woodruff 2019). \n\nA dialogue of definition, the Charmides takes up the subject\nof temperance or sound-mindedness (sophrosune). This is the\nvirtue that produces self-control, the ability to resist the\ntemptation to act violently in satisfaction of desires, the temptation\nthat, in Plato’s scheme of things, characteristically leads tyrants to\ndisaster. The main theme of this dialogue is the role of knowledge in\nvirtue. \n\nThe dramatic date of the dialogue is before Plato’s birth, and\nSocrates’ main partners are Plato’s maternal uncle, Charmides, then a\nteenager, and Charmides’ older first cousin Critias. By the time Plato\nwrote the dialogue, both men had been killed in the battle of the\nPiraeus, in 403BCE. Critias had been the leader of the group known to\ntheir enemies as the Thirty Tyrants, and Charmides had been among the\nextended leadership established by the Thirty. The excesses of the\nThirty, who had conducted a violent and rapacious reign of terror in\n404–03, provide an historical counterpoint to the declared interest of\nthese men in sound-mindedness almost thirty years earlier. \n\nThe topic arises when Charmides is praised for both external and\ninternal good qualities, including sound-mindedness. Socrates assumes\nthat Charmides must have some sense of what this virtue is, if he has\nit within him (158e). Charmides answers first that sound-mindedness is\na kind of quietness and order (159b); indeed, he has a reputation for\nsound-mindedness because of his quiet and orderly good manners. This\nfails because sound-mindedness is among those things that are always\nfine, and quietness is fine only in certain contexts. The relevant\ncondition on definition in this case is that of explanation; the\nproposed explanation does not consistently have the feature it is\nsupposed to explain. Charmides’ second attempt fails by the same\ncriterion: a sense of shame looks like sound-mindedness in some\ncontexts, but it appears not always to be a good thing\n(160e–161b). His third attempt is plagiarized, probably from Critias,\nwho may have heard it from Socrates: Sound-mindedness is doing one’s\nown things (a phrase identical to that used in the Republic\nto define justice). Charmides is unable to explain what this\nmeans. Critias takes over, in order to defend his definition, and is\nled to gloss it as doing good things (163e). \n\nSocrates then introduces the issue of knowledge, which Critias agrees\nis necessary to the exercise of sound-mindedness. But knowledge of\nwhat? Critias suggests that it is self-knowledge that is\nsound-mindedness (164d). Critias has in mind the kind of\nself-knowledge that consists in knowing what one knows and what one\ndoes not know.  From this it is a short step to defining the virtue as\nthe knowledge of itself and the other kinds of knowledge—i.e.,\nthe knowledge that enables one to evaluate all sorts of knowledge\nclaims (166e). Socrates raises two questions about this kind of\nknowledge: whether it is possible, and whether it is beneficial\n(relevant because the virtue was assumed to be beneficial). It would\nseem impossible for there to be such a kind of knowledge, since all\nother examples of kinds of knowledge have subject matter specific to\neach, and this would be an exception. To know whether a candidate has\nknowledge of medicine, for example, one would need to know\nmedicine. As for the second question, it would appear that such\nknowledge is beneficial (173a, ff.), because it would allow us to\nsubmit all decisions to knowledge. But the appearance is deceptive,\nbecause the knowledge of knowledge does not add anything to the\nvarious kinds of knowledge (such as medicine) on which we depend. \n\nThe kind of knowledge that would be most beneficial would be knowledge\nof good and evil (174b, ff.), but this is not the same thing as\nsound-mindedness. So this line of inquiry has led to the contrary\nresults that the virtue in question is and is not beneficial. The\nspeakers confess aporia and pledge to continue. Critias and\nCharmides threaten to use force to wrest continuing education from\nSocrates. This is a joke, but it comes with a disturbing historical\nirony, because Charmides will follow Critias into a leadership\nposition in the regime of the Thirty Tyrants. Their use of force will\nterrorize the people, but not achieve what Critias wants in the long\nrun. \n\nAs with other aporetic dialogues, we are left without a clear\nanswer. As with Laches and Euthyphro, however, the\ninquiry has led to a suggestion that goes beyond defining one among a\nnumber of independent virtues to investigating something of unbounded\nethical importance, the knowledge of good and evil. \n\nA dialogue of definition, the Laches takes up the subject of\ncourage, broadly construed. Unique among ancient writings about\ncourage, the Laches takes courage far beyond the battlefield,\nseeking a definition for courage not only in war but also in\nseafaring, in illness, in poverty, and in politics (191d). The\nprincipal interlocutors are men of military experience, Laches and\nNicias. Nicias is known to us for his prominence in the Sicilian\nexpedition narrated in melancholy detail by Thucydides (Books 6 and\n7).  He was enormously brave in battle, but a coward in politics,\nafraid to tell the Athenian people how dangerously situated their army\nwas. His life in itself illustrates the importance, recognized by\nSocrates, of cultivating courage in every arenas of action or\nsuffering \n\nThe dialogue begins with a specific query about military training for\nthe young. A teacher is in town, displaying a new technique for\nfighting in armor, and two elderly fathers (Lysimachus and Melesias)\nare trying to determine whether they should send their young sons to\nthis teacher. Lacking accomplishments, the fathers have no confidence\nin their ability to choose how their sons should be educated, and they\nhave asked two generals, Laches and Nicias, to observe the display and\nadvise them. Nicias advises them to accept advice from Socrates as\nwell, because Socrates has referred him to an excellent teacher of music\n(180d); Laches supports Socrates’ reputation, citing his actions\nat the battle of Delium, a disastrous defeat for Athens in which, as\nwe know from other sources, Socrates showed extraordinary courage\n(181b). This example will cast a long shadow over the subsequent\ndiscussion, for Socrates’ courage in this case was shown not merely in\ndefeat, but during a rout. \n\nSocrates makes a move that will become familiar in other dialogues.\nThe anxious fathers have consulted generals, and Socrates thinks they\nare on the right track; they should consult an expert (185a), but for\nsome time Socrates leaves it unclear what the expert should be an\nexpert about. The anxious fathers had not expressed concern about\nethics, but Socrates takes their question as ethical.  He assumes that\nthe purpose of any form of military training is to instill courage in\nthe soul (185e, with 190d), and he infers they are seeking an expert\nin that. An expert in instilling X must know what X\nis (190a). \n\nIf there is an expert on military training, then, that expert will\nbe able to say what courage is. Laches tries first, with an answer that\nis inconsistent with his praise for Socrates: Courage is staying at\nyour post and not running away (190e). Socrates had\nshown courage during a retreat, the military maneuver that most calls for\ncourage. Laches’ proposal plainly fails by the generality\nrequirement, and Socrates shows this with examples of courage that do\nnot satisfy the proposed definition (191a–d). \n\nLaches’ second try is that courage is a kind of endurance of the soul\n(192c), But what kind of endurance, foolish or wise?  Here Laches\nenters a tangle; he does not want to say that courage is ever foolish,\nbecause then courage would not be reliably kalon, as all\npresent believe that it is.  Nor does he want to say that courage\nis sophos, since mastery of the matter at hand seems to render\nactions less courageous (192c–193e).  Unable to see a way out of this\ntangle, Laches agrees with Socrates that he does not have a good\nanswer. \n\nLaches’ tangle requires someone to specify the kind of wisdom that\ncourage requires, and Nicias is prepared to do that.  Courage, he\nproposes, is knowledge of what should inspire terror or confidence in\nwar or any other circumstance (195a); Socrates will understand this to\nbe knowledge of future goods and evils.  This, as we shall see, is\nvery similar to the definition that Socrates will give to Protagoras\nin the Protagoras (360d).  Even so, the proposal will go down\nto defeat.  Knowledge of good and evil is not carved up by temporal\nwords such as “future”, and knowledge of good and evil\nplainly embraces far more than courage; indeed, it would be the whole\nof virtue (199e).  But Nicias has been clear that courage is only a\npart of virtue (198a, from 190cd).  So he too has failed to establish\nthat he knows what courage is.  \n\nHow should readers take this outcome? Has Socrates refuted to his own\nsatisfaction the position he takes in the Protagoras? The\nmatter is debated by scholars. Perhaps we can apply here a tool given\nus in the Euthyphro, where a statement about reverence (that\nit is loved by all the gods) was taken to be true, but not the\ndefinition of reverence. In a similar way, “knowledge of future\ngoods and evils” could be true of courage without satisfying the\nconditions of definition. In this case, that would be because (it\nseems) courage cannot be differentiated by definition from virtue as a\nwhole, just as reverence apparently could not be differentiated from\njustice. Like the Euthyphro, then, the Laches could\nbe read as supporting the unity of virtue. But this reading is not\nobvious; taken by itself, the dialogue seems to end on ground that is\nhostile to the unity of virtue. \n\nThe authenticity of this dialogue has been questioned\n(see Section 17).  A dialogue of definition,\nthe Hippias Major takes up the subject of the fine or\nbeautiful (to kalon), one of the two most general terms of\ncommendation in ancient Greek, the other being\nagathon, good, nearly a synonym. Being kalon is the\nprimary feature of each of the virtues, and, by implication, the\ndialogue points to an important Socratic idea about ethics: That in\nbeing kalon a virtue is beneficial. \n\nHippias is a sophist from Elis, in the northwest corner of the\nPeloponnesus; he takes pride in being a polymath, an expert on many\nsubjects including rhetoric, history, and mathematics. The question\narises because Hippias boasts about the high quality of a speech he\nwill soon make, and he invites Socrates to attend, along with others\ncapable of judging a speech. Socrates by implication invokes the\n priority of definition: \n How can anyone judge what is fine or foul in a speech, without\nknowing what it is to be fine (286c)?  “Fine” translates the Greek kalon, a general term of commendation that is often rendered as “beautiful,” “amiable,” or “noble,” but often simply means “good.” Its opposite, aischron means “ugly,” “disgusting,” “shameful,” or “foul.”   At this point Socrates introduces a strikingly\nunique feature of the dialogue, the Questioner—someone who,\nSocrates says, will not allow him to get away with claims that imply\nknowledge, but persists in asking him shame-inducing questions such as\nthis one about the fine. Since the Questioner meets Socrates in the privacy of his\nhome, we must imagine that he is Socrates’ alter ego, and that the\nprocess referred to is the self-elenchus by which Socrates is driven\nto his famous disclaimer of knowledge. \n\nThe dialogue reviews seven definitions, three proposed by Hippias, and\nfour more sophisticated ones proposed by Socrates. All are refuted,\nand the work ends at an impasse, as is usual for works in this group.\nIt does, nevertheless, point to the idea that a good (such as virtue,\nprobably) can be beneficial by replicating itself. \n\nHippias makes three category mistakes, one in each of his answers to\nthe question, “What is the Fine?” (287e–293c) He\nidentifies three kinds of entity that can be fine—a particular\n(a fine girl), a mass substance (gold), and a universal (living the\ntraditional good life). Socrates’ double strategy is the same in each\ncase: (1) To show that the answer fails the generality requirement; it\ndoes not explain all the cases of being fine. (2) To show that the\nfine entity to which Hippias refers is not fine in every context. This\nviolates the exclusion requirement, for it does not exclude non-fine\nthings. It also implies that the answer fails to satisfy the\nexplanation requirement; generally, to explain Xness,\nsomething must be X no matter what (synonymy requirement). If\nfire explains heat, that is because it is always hot; but gold cannot\nexplain fineness, because gold is not always fine; it is foul as material for\ncookware. All of these answers fail because they identify things that\nare fine in some contexts, leaving unanswered the question what makes\nthem fine in those contexts but not in others. \n\nHippias’ three answers have much in common, but they range over three\ndifferent metaphysical types, particulars, mass substances, and\nuniversals. Hippias has attempted greater degrees of generality in his\nsecond and third answers (gold and living the good life), but the more\ngeneral answers still fail.  What Socrates seeks is not so much\ngenerality as it is explanatory power. \n\nThe remaining four answers are better candidates and come (as in the\nEuthyphro) from Socrates, though in this case he attributes\nthem to the Questioner, his alter ego. They are that the fine is the appropriate, the\nable, the beneficial, and pleasure through sight and hearing. These\nrepresent a single strategy, which tries to tease out the deeper\nmeaning in the intuition that good things, such as whatever is fine,\nare beneficial. The appropriate and the able are attractive answers,\nbut only when they are taken to imply that the fine is\nbeneficial. This answer, however, leads to an odd result: if to be\nfine is to be productive of the good, then it would appear that the\nfine cannot be good, which is unacceptable. The conclusion invites us\nto ask whether a good can be beneficial in being able to replicate\nitself. (See the section \n on instrumentality.) \n The last answer attempts an aesthetic construction of the fine, and\nfounders on the problem of disjunctive definition. “What’s fine\nis hard,” Socrates concludes, resigned to be unable to judge\nwhat is fine or foul in a speech until he learns what the fine is. \n\nThe authenticity of the dialogue has been in doubt since the middle of\nthe nineteenth century; although many scholars accept it as genuine,\nthere are notable exceptions such as Charles Kahn and Holger Thesleff.\nThe argument against authenticity is based partly on the silence of\nclassical sources about it, and partly on the style. Aristotle’s\nreference to a dialogue called simply the Hippias is plainly\nto the Hippias Minor (Metaphysics 1025a6–13). The\nstyle is most likely from the fourth century BCE (Plato’s century),\nbut some have argued that its vocabulary places the dialogue late in\nthe fourth century, too late for Platonic authorship. The argument in\nfavor of authenticity follows the presumption in favor of the ancient\ncanon of Thrasyllus (which is right in most cases) and appeals to the\nunique and inventive features of the dialogue, which betray more\nartistry than could be expected from a forger. As with a number of\ndialogues from the canon, however, the case must be left not\nproven. \n\nThe Hippias Minor shows Socrates defeating a sophist on an\nethical matter: whether it is better to do wrong voluntarily or in\nignorance. Socrates concludes, somewhat unhappily, that it is better\nto do wrong voluntarily. The issue arises in the context of Hippias’\nmultiple claims to expertise; he can win speaking contests on any\ntopic, and he has excelled in many different arts, from shoemaking to\nthe art of memory (363cd, 368be). Socrates asks a question that at\nfirst appears to be about Homer—which is the better man,\nAchilles or Odysseus? The tradition has been to regard Achilles as\nhonest, and Odysseus as given to lying, but it is this tradition that\nSocrates intends to bring into question. He argues, by example, that\nan expert in any given field is best able to speak false in that\nfield, since an amateur liar might stumble on the truth. It follows\nthat a good liar will be an expert in the subject of his lies, and he\nwill also be a good truth teller in that field, and vice versa.  So if\nAchilles is a good truth teller, he will be a good liar as well, and\nif Odysseus is a good liar, he will be a good truth teller also. \n\nHippias rejects this conclusion. He argues that Homer shows Achilles\nto be honest and Odysseus to be a liar through the speech at\nIliad 9.308, ff., which Achilles addresses to Odysseus:\n“I hate like the gates of hell that man who says one thing and\nhas another in his mind.” Hippias is doubly mistaken in using\nthis passage as evidence for his view. At most this would show that\nAchilles (not Homer) takes Odysseus to be a liar, but in fact the text\nclearly refers to Agamemnon. Achilles takes Odysseus’ word for what\nAgamemnon has promised him, but he does not believe that this is a\ntruthful promise. \n\nHomer cannot be interrogated on the matter, so Socrates will\ninvestigate only the opinion of Hippias (365cd), although he will cite\nHomeric texts in support of his position. Socrates argues that\nAchilles is more deceptive than Odysseus, because on several occasions\nhe does not stay true to what he has said. Hippias rightly points out\nthat Achilles had no intention to deceive; he merely said what was in\nhis heart at each moment. Because his falsehood is involuntary, argues\nHippias, Achilles is the better man. Socrates disagrees: the voluntary\nliar knows his subject better and has the better mind. He is therefore\nthe better man of the two. \n\nThis leads Socrates to his main theme: whether one who does wrong\nvoluntarily is better or worse than someone who does wrong\ninvoluntarily (373c). Again arguing by example, Socrates shows that\nany failure, ethical or otherwise, would be better if it came as the\nresult of a deliberate choice, because that would imply that the\nperson who erred had the power to do the thing right if he or she\nwanted to. He concludes: “Then he who voluntarily goes wrong\n(hekon hamartanon), doing shameful and unjust\nthings, if indeed he exists, would be no other than the good\nman” (376b). Hippias cannot accept this line of reasoning, and\nSocrates admits he is uncomfortable with it (“No more can I\nconcede the point to myself”). \n\nThe argument for this conclusion assumed from the outset that it is\npossible to go wrong voluntarily; this was Hippias’ proposal in the\ncase of Odysseus. But Socrates has assumed or stated the contrary elsewhere: no one goes wrong voluntarily (Apology 26a, Protagoras 345e). The argument also assumes that people do good and bad\nactions on the basis of techne; it is reasonable to suppose\nthat the\n techne \n that could lead to good actions could also lead to bad ones. But\ntechne can be taught, so that if good and bad action are due\nto a techne, then people could be taught the power\nto act well or poorly. But Socrates does not believe that virtue can\nbe taught (Protagoras 319a–320c). In sum, the awkward\nconclusion would follow from premises that Hippias supports, but not\nfrom the views Socrates elsewhere affirms. \n\nThe Euthydemus is more complex in structure than the other\ndialogues in this group. A substantial framing dialogue between\nSocrates and Crito surrounds and intrudes upon a reported discussion\ninvolving Socrates and two brothers, Euthydemus and Dionysodorus,\ntraveling teachers who have much in common with the sophists, and who\nclaim to teach virtue, rather than the forensic rhetoric expected of\nsuch experts (274d). The discussion takes place at the Lyceum, for the\nbenefit of the boy Clinias and his admirer Ctesippus. The main\nquestion in both the frame and the embedded dialogue concerns\neducation: To what sort of teaching should the young be entrusted? \n\nSocrates challenges the brothers to show that, in addition to teaching\nvirtue, they can convince a pupil that he should learn virtue from\nthem. Instead of rising to this challenge directly, the brothers\nentangle Clinias in two verbal traps and are preparing a third when\nSocrates interrupts with the diagnosis (obviously correct) that these\ntraps depend on ignoring the careful use of verbal distinctions\n(277d–278a). \n\nSocrates then demonstrates his method of attracting a young person to\nthe pursuit of virtue and wisdom, which, by the end of the passage,\nhave been conflated into wisdom. With Clinias, he lists various good\nthings: Wealth, health, good looks, and honor comprise one list, while\ncourage, sound-mindedness, justice, and wisdom comprise another. Then\nSocrates surprises the boy by claiming that good fortune simply is\nwisdom; he defends the claim by arguing that no good thing is\nbeneficial unless its use is guided by wisdom. It follows that the\nitems on the first list are neither good nor bad in themselves (281d),\nand that the principal good to pursue is wisdom. We are probably left\nto suppose that the virtues on the second list are identical to\nwisdom.  In any event, Clinias now expresses his wish to acquire\nwisdom. \n\nThe brothers intervene with new and more disturbing arguments: it is\nnot possible to speak false or to hold a false view or to contradict,\nthey say, possibly echoing theses of the sophist Protagoras. \n\nThe second conversation between Socrates and Clinias treats wisdom as\na techne  and explores the subordination of one techne to\nanother, as the art of the general (winning battles) is subordinate to\nthe art of politics (making use of victories). The supreme techne he\ncalls kingly or royal, and this is the techne that guides the use of all others\n(291c), but this line of inquiry founders on a question that appears\nunanswerable: What is the specific knowledge that is given by the\nkingly techne? A techne is supposed to have a well defined subject\nmatter, but the techne that is wisdom would oversee all subject matter\nand therefore would seem to have no subject matter proper to itself.\nPerhaps Socrates thinks the subject is good and evil, or perhaps\nvirtue, but he does not say either, nor does he explain how these could\nbe the subjects of \n a techne. \n Because a techne is, by definition, teachable, Socrates would have to\nestablish that such knowledge can be taught, but as we see from the\n Protagoras \n Socrates has grave doubts on this score. \n\nA few more traps are set by the brothers, who exploit the similarity\nbetween complete (or absolute) and incomplete (or relative)\npredication: the dog is a dog in any semantic context, but he is a\nfather in relation to his puppies only, and not to his master. \n\nSocrates returns to his framing discussion with Crito on the\noverarching theme of the dialogue, the question of what sort of study\nshould be pursued as philosophy, and this is left as a challenge for\nCrito. The dialogue ends, as do most in this group,\ninconclusively. \n\nThe Protagoras is the most substantial dialogue in this\ngroup. Its general theme is the question whether virtue can be\ntaught, and this leads to the question whether virtue is wisdom or\nknowledge. Other topics treated in the dialogue are\n the unity of virtue, \n the instrumentality of virtue for pleasure, and the\ndenial of\n acrasia. \n\nThe two main speakers divide on these questions in an unexpected way:\nSocrates, who believes that virtue cannot be taught, and that he does\nnot teach it, defends the unity of all virtues with wisdom, even\ncourage; Protagoras, who believes that virtue can be taught, and that\nhe teaches it, denies that courage is wisdom or any sort of knowledge. Moreover,\nSocrates, who elsewhere rejects hedonism, seems to identify virtue\nwith a hedonic calculus in this dialogue, through an argument that leads\nto his famous claim that\n of acrasia (weakness of will) is impossible. \n\nThe setting of the Protagoras is striking: the cast of\ncharacters is the same as that in the Symposium, but here\nthey are gathered for exhibitions of the skill of the sophists,\nespecially of Protagoras. Socrates, speaking on behalf of a\nprospective student, prompts Protagoras to say what it is that he\nteaches. It is, says Protagoras, good judgment, so that one may act\nand speak most effectively both in private and in public matters\n(318e). \n\nIn a substantial comment (319a–320c), Socrates understands this to\nmean that Protagoras teaches the techne of good citizenship,\nwhich he takes to be the virtue of citizens, and to include political\nwisdom. Socrates argues that such virtue cannot be taught; if it\ncould, Pericles would have imparted it to his sons, but he failed to\ndo so.  This argument might convince Socrates’ audience, but it cannot\nhave convinced Socrates, who was no great admirer of Pericles. \n\nProtagoras responds with an enormous speech, often called the\n“great speech,” (320c–328d), which is divided into a myth\nand an account (logos). Many scholars accept the content of\nthe speech as Protagorean, although the setting surely belongs to\nhistorical fiction.  In sum, Protagoras thinks that the political\nvirtues of justice and reverence or sound-mindedness are necessary to\nhuman communities, and that all normal human beings therefore have the\ncapacity to acquire those virtues to some extent (although not all to\nthe same extent), just as all human beings have the capacity to learn\na language. As in the case of language, the community teaches the\npolitical virtues to its citizens from early childhood on, and\nProtagoras discusses in some detail the traditional stages in\neducation which he believes lead to this result. He also provides a\ntheory of punishment as educational. \n\nSocrates does not take on Protagoras’ claims\ndirectly. Instead, he takes another tack and engages Protagoras in\nthree rounds. In the first round, he asks about \n the unity of virtues, \n arguing for the unity of justice and piety, of wisdom and\nself-control, and of self-control and justice (328d–334c). The series\nof arguments is inconclusive; Protagoras’ consent to them is grudging,\nand scholarly opinion is divided as to their soundness. The series\nbreaks down over the issue of sound-mindedness and injustice. It would\nappear that one could apply a sound mind to unjust actions (say, by\nnot letting sensual pleasures distract one from a life of theft).  But\nSocrates seems about to say that both justice and sound-mindedness aim\nat what is beneficial to human beings, and this provokes Protagoras to\naffirm the incompleteness of the word “advantageous”:\ndifferent things are advantageous to different species, and in\ndifferent applications. \n\nThere follows a discussion on how to discuss such issues, and\nProtagoras starts a new line of conversation, this one dealing with\nthe interpretation of a poem by Simonides that seems to deal with the\nacquisition and retention of virtue (338e–48a). Protagoras finds what\nlooks like an inconsistency in the poem, but Socrates introduces\ndistinctions (foreign to the text of the poem) that allow him to read\nSimonides as supporting the Socratic views that (1) it is difficult to\nacquire perfect virtue and (2) no one does wrong voluntarily. Socrates\ndoes not believe, however, that it is wise to discourse upon poets who\nare not present to explain themselves. It is far better for them to\npresent their own opinions (347c–348a). \n\nSocrates brings the discussion back to the unity of virtue, here\narguing for the unity of courage and wisdom (348b–351b). Socrates\nargues that knowledge leads to confidence, but Protagoras insists that\nthis is irrelevant, because not all confident people are\ncourageous. \n\nSocrates then approaches the wisdom-virtue question from another\nangle, that \n of acrasia \n (weakness of will, 351b–358d), seeking to show that there is a kind\nof wisdom that is sufficient for virtue. This turns out to be a\nhedonic calculus that gives full value to temporally distant pleasures\nand pains.  Socrates’ argument is targeted on those who think that\nwisdom can be overpowered by pleasure, as is the case with someone\nwhose knowledge of the ill-effects of certain foods eats them anyway\nbecause of the pleasure they afford. If the scale of pleasures is the\nonly scale of good, however, and if the agents in this case have the\nwisdom to calculate correctly the pleasure the agents may reasonably\nexpect from each choice, then they cannot be led by pleasure to choose\nthe worse, or less pleasurable course. The popular explanation for\neating what we know is bad for us turns out, on this showing, to be\nincoherent. Some philosophers have thought Socrates simply overlooked\nthe psychological facts of such cases, but Aristotle makes\ndistinctions that allow him to retain the Socratic view that ethical\nfailure implies cognitive failure without sacrificing common ideas\nabout human motivation (Nicomachean Ethics 7). The matter was\nand still is controversial among philosophers. \n\nDoes the passage imply that Socrates is a hedonist? Protagoras does\nnot accept the narrow hedonism of Socrates’ premise, so it appears\nthat the hedonism is Socrates’ own. It is not anyone else’s. And yet\nwe know that Socrates is elsewhere opposed to hedonism; his solution\nto the ethical problem of the Crito is based not on pleasure\nbut on what, after serious consideration, he believes justice to\nrequire. There is no consensus on how to solve the puzzle. Could\nSocrates defend his doctrine on knowledge here without the hedonist\npremise? In the Republic he will maintain at least part of that\ndoctrine by introducing a division of the soul into three parts.  But\nif the soul is undivided, hedonism may be Socrates’ best defense (Moss\n2014).   \n\nThe dialogue ends with a renewal of the discussion on wisdom and\ncourage (358d–360e). Socrates presses upon a reluctant Protagoras his\nidea that courage is the knowledge of that which is and is not to be\nfeared (360d), a doctrine that, in effect, he refutes as a definition\nfor courage in the Laches. The dialogue\nends inconclusively with agreement that the matters at issue require\nmore discussion.","contact.mail":"pbw@mail.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"mail.utexas.edu"}]
