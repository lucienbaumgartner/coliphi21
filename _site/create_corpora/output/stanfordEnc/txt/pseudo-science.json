The major\nproposed demarcation criteria for pseudo-science are discussed and\nsome of their weaknesses are pointed out. There is much more agreement\non particular cases of demarcation than on the general criteria that\nsuch judgments should be based upon. This is an indication that there\nis still much important philosophical work to be done on the\ndemarcation between science and pseudoscience.\n\nDemarcations of science from pseudoscience can be made for both\ntheoretical and practical reasons (Mahner 2007, 516). From a\ntheoretical point of view, the demarcation issue is an illuminating\nperspective that contributes to the philosophy of science in much the same\nway that the study of fallacies contributes to our knowledge of informal\nlogic and rational argumentation. From a practical point of view, the\ndistinction is important for decision guidance in both private and\npublic life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in\na wide range of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge\nfrom its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day\nsociety, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various\nclaims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the\ndemarcation issue pressing in many areas. The demarcation issue is\ntherefore important in practical applications such as the\nfollowing: Climate policy: The scientific consensus on ongoing\nanthropogenic climate change leaves no room for reasonable doubt (Cook\net al. 2016; Powell 2019). Science denial has considerably delayed\nclimate action, and it is still one of the major factors that impede\nefficient measures to reduce climate change (Oreskes and Conway 2010;\nLewandowsky et al. 2019). Decision-makers and the public need to know\nhow to distinguish between competent climate science and\nscience-mimicking disinformation on the climate. Environmental policies: In order to be on the safe\nside against potential disasters it may be legitimate to take\npreventive measures when there is valid but yet insufficient evidence\nof an environmental hazard. This must be distinguished from taking\nmeasures against an alleged hazard for which there is no valid\nevidence at all.  Therefore, decision-makers in environmental policy\nmust be able to distinguish between scientific and pseudoscientific\nclaims. Healthcare: Medical science develops and evaluates\ntreatments according to evidence of their effectiveness and\nsafety. Pseudoscientific activities in this area give rise to\nineffective and sometimes dangerous interventions. Healthcare\nproviders, insurers, government authorities and – most\nimportantly – patients need guidance on how to distinguish\nbetween medical science and medical pseudoscience. Expert testimony: It is essential for the rule of law\nthat courts get the facts right. The reliability of different types of\nevidence must be correctly determined, and expert testimony must be\nbased on the best available knowledge. Sometimes it is in the interest\nof litigants to present non-scientific claims as solid science.\nTherefore courts must be able to distinguish between science and\npseudoscience. Philosophers have often had prominent roles in the\ndefence of science against pseudoscience in such contexts. (Pennock\n2011)  Science education: The promoters of some\npseudosciences (notably creationism) try to introduce their teachings\nin school curricula. Teachers and school authorities need to have\nclear criteria of inclusion that protect students against unreliable\nand disproved teachings. Journalism: When there is scientific uncertainty, or\nrelevant disagreement in the scientific community, this should be\ncovered and explained in media reports on the issues in\nquestion. Equally importantly, differences of opinion between on the\none hand legitimate scientific experts and on the other hand\nproponents of scientifically unsubstantiated claims should be\ndescribed as what they are. Public understanding of topics such as\nclimate change and vaccination has been considerably hampered by\norganised campaigns that succeeded in making media portray standpoints\nthat have been thoroughly disproved in science as legitimate\nscientific standpoints (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Boykoff 2008). The\nmedia need tools and practices to distinguish between legitimate\nscientific controversies and attempts to peddle pseudoscientific\nclaims as science. \nAttempts to define what we today call science have a long history, and\nthe roots of the demarcation problem have sometimes been traced back\nto Aristotle’s Posterior Analytics (Laudan\n1983). Cicero’s arguments for dismissing certain methods of divination\nin his De divinatione has considerable similarities with\nmodern criteria for the demarcation of science (Fernandez-Beanato\n2020).  However it was not until the 20th century that influential\ndefinitions of science have contrasted it against\npseudoscience. Philosophical work on the demarcation problem seems to\nhave waned after Laudan’s (1983) much noted death certificate\naccording to which there is no hope of finding a necessary and\nsufficient criterion of something as heterogeneous as scientific\nmethodology. In more recent years, the problem has been\nrevitalized. Philosophers attesting to its vitality maintain that the\nconcept can be clarified by other means than necessary and sufficient\ncriteria (Pigliucci 2013; Mahner 2013) or that such a definition is\nindeed possible although it has to be supplemented with\ndiscipline-specific criteria in order to become fully operative\n(Hansson 2013). \nThe Latin word “pseudoscientia” was used already in the\nfirst half of the 17th century in discussions about the relationship\nbetween religion and empirical investigations (Guldentops 2020,\n288n). The oldest known use of the English word\n“pseudoscience” dates from 1796, when the historian James\nPettit Andrew referred to alchemy as a “fantastical\npseudo-science” (Oxford English Dictionary). The word has been\nin frequent use since the 1880s (Thurs and Numbers 2013). Throughout\nits history the word has had a clearly defamatory meaning (Laudan\n1983, 119; Dolby 1987, 204). It would be as strange for someone to\nproudly describe her own activities as pseudoscience as to boast that\nthey are bad science. Since the derogatory connotation is an essential\ncharacteristic of the word “pseudoscience”, an attempt to\nextricate a value-free definition of the term would not be\nmeaningful. An essentially value-laden term has to be defined in\nvalue-laden terms. This is often difficult since the specification of\nthe value component tends to be controversial. \nThis problem is not specific to pseudoscience, but follows directly\nfrom a parallel but somewhat less conspicuous problem with the concept\nof science. The common usage of the term “science” can be\ndescribed as partly descriptive, partly normative. When an activity is\nrecognized as science this usually involves an acknowledgement that it\nhas a positive role in our strivings for knowledge. On the other hand,\nthe concept of science has been formed through a historical process,\nand many contingencies influence what we call and do not call\nscience. Whether we call a claim, doctrine, or discipline\n“scientific” depends both on its subject area and its\nepistemic qualities. The former part of the delimitation is largely\nconventional, whereas the latter is highly normative, and closely\nconnected with fundamental epistemological and metaphysical\nissues. \nAgainst this background, in order not to be unduly complex a\ndefinition of science has to go in either of two directions. It can\nfocus on the descriptive contents, and specify how the term is\nactually used. Alternatively, it can focus on the normative element,\nand clarify the more fundamental meaning of the term. The latter\napproach has been the choice of most philosophers writing on the\nsubject, and will be at focus here. It involves, of necessity, some\ndegree of idealization in relation to common usage of the term\n“science”, in particular concerning the delimitation of\nthe subject-area of science. \nThe English word “science” is primarily used about the\nnatural sciences and other fields of research that are considered to\nbe similar to them. Hence, political economy and sociology are counted\nas sciences, whereas studies of literature and history are usually\nnot. The corresponding German word, “Wissenschaft”, has a\nmuch broader meaning and includes all the academic specialties,\nincluding the humanities. The German term has the advantage of more\nadequately delimiting the type of systematic knowledge that is at\nstake in the conflict between science and pseudoscience. The\nmisrepresentations of history presented by Holocaust deniers and other\npseudo-historians are very similar in nature to the misrepresentations\nof natural science promoted by creationists and homeopaths. \nMore importantly, the natural and social sciences and the humanities\nare all parts of the same human endeavour, namely systematic and\ncritical investigations aimed at acquiring the best possible\nunderstanding of the workings of nature, people, and human society.\nThe disciplines that form this community of knowledge\ndisciplines are increasingly interdependent. Since\nthe second half of the 20th century, integrative disciplines such as\nastrophysics, evolutionary biology, biochemistry, ecology, quantum\nchemistry, the neurosciences, and game theory have developed at\ndramatic speed and contributed to tying together previously\nunconnected disciplines. These increased interconnections have also\nlinked the sciences and the humanities closer to each other, as can be\nseen for instance from how historical knowledge relies increasingly on\nadvanced scientific analysis of archaeological findings. \nThe conflict between science and pseudoscience is best understood with\nthis extended sense of science. On one side of the conflict we find\nthe community of knowledge disciplines that includes the natural and\nsocial sciences and the humanities. On the other side we find a wide\nvariety of movements and doctrines, such as creationism, astrology,\nhomeopathy, and Holocaust denialism that are in conflict with results\nand methods that are generally accepted in the community of knowledge\ndisciplines. \nAnother way to express this is that the demarcation problem has a\ndeeper concern than that of demarcating the selection of human\nactivities that we have for various reasons chosen to call\n“sciences”. The ultimate issue is “how to determine\nwhich beliefs are epistemically warranted” (Fuller 1985,\n331). In a wider approach, the sciences are fact-finding\npractices, i.e., human practices aimed at finding out, as far as\npossible, how things really are (Hansson 2018). Other examples of\nfact-finding practices in modern societies are journalism, criminal\ninvestigations, and the methods used by mechanics to search for the\ndefect in a malfunctioning machine. Fact-finding practices are also\nprevalent in indigenous societies, for instance in the forms of\ntraditional agricultural experimentation and the methods used for\ntracking animal prey (Liebenberg 2013). In this perspective, the\ndemarcation of science is a special case of the delimitation of\naccurate fact-finding practices. The delimitation between science and\npseudoscience has much in common with other delimitations, such as\nthat between accurate and inaccurate journalism and between properly\nand improperly performed criminal investigations (Hansson 2018). \nThe phrases “demarcation of science” and\n“demarcation of science from pseudoscience” are often used\ninterchangeably, and many authors seem to have regarded them as equal\nin meaning. In their view, the task of drawing the outer boundaries of\nscience is essentially the same as that of drawing the boundary\nbetween science and pseudoscience. \nThis picture is oversimplified. All non-science is not pseudoscience,\nand science has non-trivial borders to other non-scientific phenomena,\nsuch as metaphysics, religion, and various types of non-scientific\nsystematized knowledge. (Mahner (2007, 548) proposed the term\n“parascience” to cover non-scientific practices that are\nnot pseudoscientific.) Science also has the internal demarcation\nproblem of distinguishing between good and bad science. \nA comparison of the negated terms related to science can contribute to\nclarifying the conceptual distinctions. “Unscientific” is a\nnarrower concept than “non-scientific” (not scientific),\nsince the former but not the latter term implies some form of\ncontradiction or conflict with science. “Pseudoscientific”\nis in its turn a narrower concept than “unscientific”. The\nlatter term differs from the former in covering inadvertent\nmismeasurements and miscalculations and other forms of bad science\nperformed by scientists who are recognized as trying but failing to\nproduce good science. \nEtymology provides us with an obvious starting-point for clarifying\nwhat characteristics pseudoscience has in addition to being merely\nnon- or un-scientific. “Pseudo-”\n(ψευδο-) means false. In accordance\nwith this, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines pseudoscience\nas follows: \nMany writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is\nnon-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the\nsubject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the\nName of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438),\n“[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they\nmasquerade as genuinely scientific ones.” These and many other\nauthors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching\nhas to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): \nThe former of the two criteria is central to the concerns of the\nphilosophy of science. Its precise meaning has been the subject of\nimportant controversies among philosophers, to be discussed below in\nSection 4.  The second criterion has been less discussed by philosophers,\nbut it needs careful treatment not least since many discussions of\npseudoscience (in and out of philosophy) have been confused due to\ninsufficient attention to it. Proponents of pseudoscience often\nattempt to mimic science by arranging conferences, journals, and\nassociations that share many of the superficial characteristics of\nscience, but do not satisfy its quality criteria. Naomi Oreskes (2019)\ncalled this phenomenon “facsimile science”. Blancke and\ncoworkers (2017) called it “cultural mimicry of\nscience”. \nAn immediate problem with the definition based on (1) and (2) is that\nit is too wide. There are phenomena that satisfy both criteria but are\nnot commonly called pseudoscientific. One of the clearest examples of\nthis is fraud in science. This is a practice that has a high degree of\nscientific pretence and yet does not comply with science, thus\nsatisfying both criteria. Nevertheless, fraud in otherwise legitimate\nbranches of science is seldom if ever called\n“pseudoscience”. The reason for this can be clarified with\nthe following hypothetical examples (Hansson 1996). \nAccording to common usage, 1 and 3 are regarded as cases of bad\nscience, and only 2 as a case of pseudoscience. What is present in\ncase 2, but absent in the other two, is a deviant doctrine.\nIsolated breaches of the requirements of science are not commonly\nregarded as pseudoscientific. Pseudoscience, as it is commonly\nconceived, involves a sustained effort to promote standpoints\ndifferent from those that have scientific legitimacy at the time. \nThis explains why fraud in science is not usually regarded as\npseudoscientific. Such practices are not in general associated with a\ndeviant or unorthodox doctrine. To the contrary, the fraudulent\nscientist is usually anxious that her results be in conformity with\nthe predictions of established scientific theories. Deviations from\nthese would lead to a much higher risk of disclosure. \nThe term “science” has both an individuated and an\nunindividuated sense. In the individuated sense, biochemistry and\nastronomy are different sciences, one of which includes studies of\nmuscle proteins and the other studies of supernovae. The Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary (OED) defines this sense of science as “a\nparticular branch of knowledge or study; a recognized department of\nlearning”. In the unindividuated sense, the study of muscle\nproteins and that of supernovae are parts of “one and the\nsame” science. In the words of the OED, unindividuated science\nis “the kind of knowledge or intellectual activity of which the\nvarious ‘sciences‘ are examples”. \nPseudoscience is an antithesis of science in the individuated rather\nthan the unindividuated sense. There is no unified corpus of\npseudoscience corresponding to the corpus of science. For a phenomenon\nto be pseudoscientific, it must belong to one or the other of the\nparticular pseudosciences. In order to accommodate this feature, the\nabove definition can be modified by replacing (2) by the following\n(Hansson 1996): \nMost philosophers of science, and most scientists, prefer to regard\nscience as constituted by methods of inquiry rather than by particular\ndoctrines. There is an obvious tension between (2′) and this\nconventional view of science. This, however, may be as it should since\npseudoscience often involves a representation of science as a closed\nand finished doctrine rather than as a methodology for open-ended\ninquiry. \nSometimes the term “pseudoscience” is used in a wider\nsense than that which is captured in the definition constituted of (1)\nand (2′). Contrary to (2′), doctrines that conflict with\nscience are sometimes called “pseudoscientific” in spite\nof not being advanced as scientific. Hence, Grove (1985, 219) included\namong the pseudoscientific doctrines those that “purport to\noffer alternative accounts to those of science or claim to explain\nwhat science cannot explain.” Similarly, Lugg (1987,\n227–228) maintained that “the clairvoyant’s\npredictions are pseudoscientific whether or not they are\ncorrect”, despite the fact that most clairvoyants do not profess\nto be practitioners of science. In this sense, pseudoscience is\nassumed to include not only doctrines contrary to science\nproclaimed to be scientific but doctrines contrary to\nscience tout court, whether or not they are put forward in\nthe name of science. Arguably, the crucial issue is not whether\nsomething is called “science” but whether it is claimed to\nhave the function of science, namely to provide the most reliable\ninformation about its subject-matter. To cover this wider sense of\npseudoscience, (2′) can be modified as follows (Hansson 1996,\n2013): \nCommon usage seems to vacillate between the definitions (1)+(2′)\nand (1)+(2″); and this in an interesting way: In their comments\non the meaning of the term, critics of pseudoscience tend to endorse a\ndefinition close to (1)+(2′), but their actual usage is often\ncloser to (1)+(2″). \nThe following examples serve to illustrate the difference between the\ntwo definitions and also to clarify why clause (1) is needed: \n(a) does not satisfy (1), and is therefore not pseudoscientific on\neither account. (b) satisfies (1) but neither (2′) nor\n(2″) and is therefore not pseudoscientific on either account.\n(c) satisfies all three criteria, (1), (2′), and (2″), and\nis therefore pseudoscientific on both accounts. Finally, (d) satisfies\n(1) and (2″) and is therefore pseudoscientific according to\n(1)+(2″) but not according to (1)+(2′). As the last two\nexamples illustrate, pseudoscience and anti-science are sometimes\ndifficult to distinguish. Promoters of some pseudosciences (notably\nhomeopathy) tend to be ambiguous between opposition to science and\nclaims that they themselves represent the best science. \nVarious proposals have been put forward on exactly what elements in\nscience or pseudoscience criteria of demarcation should be applied to.\nProposals include that the demarcation should refer to a research\nprogram (Lakatos 1974a, 248–249), an epistemic field or\ncognitive discipline, i.e. a group of people with common knowledge\naims, and their practices (Bunge 1982, 2001; Mahner 2007), a theory\n(Popper 1962, 1974), a practice (Lugg 1992; Morris 1987), a scientific\nproblem or question (Siitonen 1984), and a particular inquiry (Kuhn\n1974; Mayo 1996). It is probably fair to say that demarcation criteria\ncan be meaningfully applied on each of these levels of description. A\nmuch more difficult problem is whether one of these levels is the\nfundamental level to which assessments on the other levels are\nreducible. However, it should be noted that appraisals on different\nlevels may be interdefinable. For instance, it is not an unreasonable\nassumption that a pseudoscientific doctrine is one that contains\npseudoscientific statements as its core or defining\nclaims. Conversely, a pseudoscientific statement may be characterized\nin terms of being endorsed by a pseudoscientific doctrine but not by\nlegitimate scientific accounts of the same subject area. \nDerksen (1993) differs from most other writers on the subject in\nplacing the emphasis in demarcation on the pseudoscientist, i.e. the\nindividual person conducting pseudoscience. His major argument for\nthis is that pseudoscience has scientific pretensions, and such\npretensions are associated with a person, not a theory, practice or\nentire field. However, as was noted by Settle (1971), it is the\nrationality and critical attitude built into institutions, rather than\nthe personal intellectual traits of individuals, that distinguishes\nscience from non-scientific practices such as magic. The individual\npractitioner of magic in a pre-literate society is not necessarily\nless rational than the individual scientist in modern Western society.\nWhat she lacks is an intellectual environment of collective\nrationality and mutual criticism. “It is almost a fallacy of\ndivision to insist on each individual scientist being\ncritically-minded” (Settle 1971, 174). \nSome authors have maintained that the demarcation between science and\npseudoscience must be timeless. If this were true, then it would be\ncontradictory to label something as pseudoscience at one but not\nanother point in time. Hence, after showing that creationism is in\nsome respects similar to some doctrines from the early 18th century,\none author maintained that “if such an activity was describable\nas science then, there is a cause for describing it as science\nnow” (Dolby 1987, 207). This argument is based on a fundamental\nmisconception of science. It is an essential feature of science that\nit methodically strives for improvement through empirical testing,\nintellectual criticism, and the exploration of new terrain. A\nstandpoint or theory cannot be scientific unless it relates adequately\nto this process of improvement, which means as a minimum that\nwell-founded rejections of previous scientific standpoints are\naccepted. The practical demarcation of science cannot be timeless, for\nthe simple reason that science itself is not timeless. \nNevertheless, the mutability of science is one of the factors that\nrenders the demarcation between science and pseudoscience difficult.\nDerksen (1993, 19) rightly pointed out three major reasons why\ndemarcation is sometimes difficult: science changes over time, science\nis heterogenous, and established science itself is not free of the\ndefects characteristic of pseudoscience. \nPhilosophical discussions on the demarcation of pseudoscience have\nusually focused on the normative issue, i.e. the missing scientific\nquality of pseudoscience (rather than on its attempt to mimic\nscience. One option is to base the demarcation on the fundamental\nfunction that science shares with other fact-finding processes, namely\nto provide us with the most reliable information about its\nsubject-matter that is currently available. This could lead to the\nspecification of critierion (1) from Section 3.2 as follows:  \nThis definition has the advantages of (i) being applicable across\ndisciplines with highly different methodologies and (ii) allowing for\na statement to be pseudoscientific at present although it was not so\nin an earlier period (or, although less commonly, the other way\naround). (Hansson 2013) At the same time it removes the practical\ndetermination whether a statement or doctrine is pseudoscientific from\nthe purview of armchair philosophy to that of scientists specialized\nin the subject-matter that the statement or doctrine relates\nto. Philosophers have usually opted for demarcation criteria that appear not to require specialized knowledge in the pertinent\nsubject area.\n \nAround 1930, the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle developed\nvarious verificationist approaches to science. The basic idea was that\na scientific statement could be distinguished from a metaphysical\nstatement by being at least in principle possible to verify. This\nstandpoint was associated with the view that the meaning of a\nproposition is its method of verification (see the section on\nVerificationism in the entry on the\n Vienna Circle).\n This proposal has often been included in accounts of the demarcation\nbetween science and pseudoscience. However, this is not historically\nquite accurate since the verificationist proposals had the aim of\nsolving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that\nbetween science and metaphysics. \nKarl Popper described the demarcation problem as the “key to\nmost of the fundamental problems in the philosophy of science”\n(Popper 1962, 42). He rejected verifiability as a criterion for a\nscientific theory or hypothesis to be scientific, rather than\npseudoscientific or metaphysical. Instead he proposed as a criterion\nthat the theory be falsifiable, or more precisely that\n“statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as\nscientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or\nconceivable observations” (Popper 1962, 39). \nPopper presented this proposal as a way to draw the line between\nstatements belonging to the empirical sciences and “all other\nstatements – whether they are of a religious or of a\nmetaphysical character, or simply pseudoscientific” (Popper\n1962, 39; cf. Popper 1974, 981). This was both an alternative to the\nlogical positivists’ verification criteria and a criterion for\ndistinguishing between science and pseudoscience. Although Popper did\nnot emphasize the distinction, these are of course two different\nissues (Bartley 1968). Popper conceded that metaphysical statements\nmay be “far from meaningless” (1974, 978–979) but\nshowed no such appreciation of pseudoscientific statements. \nPopper’s demarcation criterion has been criticized both for\nexcluding legitimate science (Hansson 2006) and for giving some\npseudosciences the status of being scientific (Agassi 1991; Mahner\n2007, 518–519). Strictly speaking, his criterion excludes the\npossibility that there can be a pseudoscientific claim that is\nrefutable. According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it “has the\nuntoward consequence of countenancing as ‘scientific’\nevery crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions”.\nAstrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a\npseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted (Culver\nand Ianna 1988; Carlson 1985). Similarly, the major threats to the\nscientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do\nnot come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has\nbeen tested and failed the tests. \nDefenders of Popper have claimed that this criticism relies on an\nuncharitable interpretation of his ideas. They claim that he should\nnot be interpreted as meaning that falsifiability is a sufficient\ncondition for demarcating science. Some passages seem to suggest that\nhe takes it as only a necessary condition (Feleppa 1990, 142). Other\npassages suggest that for a theory to be scientific, Popper requires\n(in addition to falsifiability) that energetic attempts are made to\nput the theory to test and that negative outcomes of the tests are\naccepted (Cioffi 1985, 14–16). A falsification-based demarcation\ncriterion that includes these elements will avoid the most obvious\ncounter-arguments to a criterion based on falsifiability alone. \nHowever, in what seems to be his last statement of his position,\nPopper declared that falsifiability is a both necessary and a\nsufficient criterion. “A sentence (or a theory) is\nempirical-scientific if and only if it is falsifiable.”\nFurthermore, he emphasized that the falsifiability referred to here\n“only has to do with the logical structure of sentences and\nclasses of sentences” (Popper [1989] 1994, 82). A (theoretical)\nsentence, he says, is falsifiable if and only if it logically\ncontradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically\npossible event that it would be logically possible to observe (Popper\n[1989] 1994, 83). A statement can be falsifiable in this sense\nalthough it is not in practice possible to falsify it. It would seem\nto follow from this interpretation that a statement’s status as\nscientific or non-scientific does not shift with time. On previous\noccasions he seems to have interpreted falsifiability differently, and\nmaintained that “what was a metaphysical idea yesterday can\nbecome a testable scientific theory tomorrow; and this happens\nfrequently” (Popper 1974, 981, cf. 984). \nLogical falsifiability is a much weaker criterion than practical\nfalsifiability. However, even logical falsifiability can create\nproblems in practical demarcations. Popper once adopted the view that\nnatural selection is not a proper scientific theory, arguing that it\ncomes close to only saying that “survivors survive”, which\nis tautological. “Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory,\nbut a metaphysical research program” (Popper 1976, 168). This\nstatement has been criticized by evolutionary scientists who pointed\nout that it misrepresents evolution. The theory of natural selection\nhas given rise to many predictions that have withstood tests both in\nfield studies and in laboratory settings (Ruse 1977; 2000). \nIn a lecture in Darwin College in 1977, Popper retracted his previous\nview that the theory of natural selection is tautological. He now\nadmitted that it is a testable theory although “difficult to\ntest” (Popper 1978, 344). However, in spite of his well-argued\nrecantation, his previous standpoint continues to be propagated in\ndefiance of the accumulating evidence from empirical tests of natural\nselection. \nThomas Kuhn is one of many philosophers for whom Popper’s view\non the demarcation problem was a starting-point for developing their\nown ideas. Kuhn criticized Popper for characterizing “the entire\nscientific enterprise in terms that apply only to its occasional\nrevolutionary parts” (Kuhn 1974, 802). Popper’s focus on\nfalsifications of theories led to a concentration on the rather rare\ninstances when a whole theory is at stake. According to Kuhn, the way\nin which science works on such occasions cannot be used to\ncharacterize the entire scientific enterprise. Instead it is in\n“normal science”, the science that takes place between the\nunusual moments of scientific revolutions, that we find the\ncharacteristics by which science can be distinguished from other\nactivities (Kuhn 1974, 801). \nIn normal science, the scientist’s activity consists in solving\npuzzles rather than testing fundamental theories. In puzzle-solving,\ncurrent theory is accepted, and the puzzle is indeed defined in its\nterms. In Kuhn’s view, “it is normal science, in which Sir\nKarl’s sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary\nscience which most nearly distinguishes science from other\nenterprises”, and therefore a demarcation criterion must refer\nto the workings of normal science (Kuhn 1974, 802). Kuhn’s own\ndemarcation criterion is the capability of puzzle-solving, which he sees\nas an essential characteristic of normal science. \nKuhn’s view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his\ncomparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has\nbeen a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an\nastronomer’s prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he\ncould hope to solve for instance with more measurements or\nadjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such\npuzzles since in that discipline “particular failures did not\ngive rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make\nuse of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological\ntradition” (Kuhn 1974, 804). Therefore, according to Kuhn,\nastrology has never been a science. \nPopper disapproved thoroughly of Kuhn’s demarcation criterion.\nAccording to Popper, astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and\nconsequently Kuhn’s criterion commits him to recognize astrology\nas a science. (Contrary to Kuhn, Popper defined puzzles as\n“minor problems which do not affect the routine”.) In his\nview Kuhn’s proposal leads to “the major disaster”\nof a “replacement of a rational criterion of science by a\nsociological one” (Popper 1974, 1146–1147). \nPopper’s demarcation criterion concerns the logical structure of\ntheories. Imre Lakatos described this criterion as “a rather\nstunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred\nof evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all\nthe available evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or\nnon-scientific character of a theory can be determined independently\nof the facts” (Lakatos 1981, 117). \nInstead, Lakatos (1970; 1974a; 1974b; 1981) proposed a modification of\nPopper’s criterion that he called “sophisticated\n(methodological) falsificationism”. On this view, the\ndemarcation criterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis\nor theory, but rather to a whole research program that is characterized\nby a series of theories successively replacing each other. In his\nview, a research program is progressive if the new theories make\nsurprising predictions that are confirmed. In contrast, a degenerating\nresearch programme is characterized by theories being fabricated only\nin order to accommodate known facts. Progress in science is only\npossible if a research program satisfies the minimum requirement that\neach new theory that is developed in the program has a larger\nempirical content than its predecessor. If a research program does not\nsatisfy this requirement, then it is pseudoscientific. \nAccording to Paul Thagard (1978, 228), a theory or discipline is pseudoscientific\nif it satisfies two criteria. One of these is that the theory fails to\nprogress, and the other that “the community of practitioners\nmakes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the\nproblems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in\nrelation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and\ndisconfirmations”. A major difference\nbetween this approach and that of Lakatos is that Lakatos would\nclassify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific even if its\npractitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a progressive\ndiscipline. (In later work, Thagard has abandoned this approach and instead promoted a form of multi-criterial demarcation (Thagard 1988, 157-173).)  \nIn a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized the\ndistinction between the standards to be used when testing a theory and\nthose to be used when determining whether a theory should at all be\ntested. The latter, the eligibility criteria, include that the theory\nshould encapsulate the explanatory success of its rival, and that it\nshould yield testable implications that are inconsistent with those of\nthe rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is unscientific if it is\nnot testworthy in this sense. \nGeorge Reisch proposed that demarcation could be based on the\nrequirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated into\nthe other sciences. The various scientific disciplines have strong\ninterconnections that are based on methodology, theory, similarity of\nmodels etc. Creationism, for instance, is not scientific because its\nbasic principles and beliefs are incompatible with those that connect\nand unify the sciences. More generally speaking, says Reisch, an\nepistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into\nthe existing network of established sciences (Reisch 1998; cf. Bunge\n1982, 379). \nPaul Hoyninengen-Huene (2013) identifies science with systematic\nknowledge, and proposes that systematicity can be used as a\ndemarcation criterion. However as shown by Naomi Oreskes, this is a\nproblematic criterion, not least since some pseudosciences seem to\nsatisfy it (Oreskes 2019).\n \nA different approach, namely to base demarcation criteria on the value\nbase of science, was proposed by sociologist Robert K. Merton ([1942]\n1973). According to Merton, science is characterized by an\n“ethos”, i.e. spirit, that can be summarized as four sets\nof institutional imperatives. The first of these,\nuniversalism, asserts that whatever their origins, truth\nclaims should be subjected to preestablished, impersonal criteria.\nThis implies that the acceptance or rejection of claims should not\ndepend on the personal or social qualities of their protagonists. \nThe second imperative, communism, says that the substantive\nfindings of science are the products of social collaboration and\ntherefore belong to the community, rather than being owned by\nindividuals or groups. This is, as Merton pointed out, incompatible\nwith patents that reserve exclusive rights of use to inventors and\ndiscoverers. The term “communism” is somewhat\ninfelicitous; “communality” probably captures better what\nMerton aimed at. \nHis third imperative, disinterestedness, imposes a pattern of\ninstitutional control that is intended to curb the effects of personal\nor ideological motives that individual scientists may have. The fourth\nimperative, organized scepticism, implies that science allows\ndetached scrutiny of beliefs that are dearly held by other\ninstitutions. This is what sometimes brings science into conflicts\nwith religions and ideologies. \nMerton described these criteria as belonging to the sociology of\nscience, and thus as empirical statements about norms in actual\nscience rather than normative statements about how science\nshould be conducted (Merton [1942] 1973, 268). His criteria\nhave often been dismissed by sociologists as oversimplified, and they\nhave only had limited influence in philosophical discussions on the\ndemarcation issue (Dolby 1987; Ruse 2000). Their potential in the\nlatter context does not seem to have been sufficiently explored. \nPopper’s method of demarcation consists essentially of the\nsingle criterion of falsifiability (although some authors have wanted\nto combine it with the additional criteria that tests are actually\nperformed and their outcomes respected, see Section 4.2). Most of the\nother criteria discussed above are similarly mono-criterial, of course\nwith Merton’s proposal as a major exception. \nMost authors who have proposed demarcation criteria have instead put\nforward a list of such criteria. A large number of lists have been\npublished that consist of (usually 5–10) criteria that can be\nused in combination to identify a pseudoscience or pseudoscientific\npractice. This includes lists by Langmuir ([1953] 1989), Gruenberger\n(1964), Dutch (1982), Bunge (1982), Radner and Radner (1982), Kitcher\n(1982, 30–54), Grove (1985), Thagard (1988, 157–173),\nGlymour and Stalker (1990), Derksen (1993, 2001), Vollmer (1993), Ruse\n(1996, 300–306) and Mahner (2007). Many of the criteria that\nappear on such lists relate closely to criteria discussed above in\nSections 4.2 and 4.4. One such list reads as follows: \nSome of the authors who have proposed multicriterial demarcations have\ndefended this approach as being superior to any mono-criterial\ndemarcation. Hence, Bunge (1982, 372) asserted that many philosophers\nhave failed to provide an adequate definition of science since they\nhave presupposed that a single attribute will do; in his view the\ncombination of several criteria is needed. Dupré (1993, 242)\nproposed that science is best understood as a Wittgensteinian family\nresemblance concept. This would mean that there is a set of features\nthat are characteristic of science, but although every part of science\nwill have some of these features, we should not expect any part of\nscience to have all of them. Irzik and Nola (2011) proposed the use of\nthis approach in science education. \nHowever, a multicriterial definition of science is not needed to\njustify a multicriterial account of how pseudoscience deviates from\nscience. Even if science can be characterized by a single defining\ncharacteristic, different pseudoscientific practices may deviate from\nscience in widely divergent ways. \nSome forms of pseudoscience have as their main objective the promotion\nof a particular theory of their own, whereas others are driven by a\ndesire to fight down some scientific theory or branch of science. The\nformer type of pseudoscience has been called pseudo-theory\npromotion, and the latter science denial(ism) (Hansson\n2017). Pseudo-theory promotion is exemplified by homeopathy,\nastrology, and ancient astronaut theories.  The term\n“denial” was first used about the pseudo-scientific claim\nthat the Nazi holocaust never took place. The phrase “holocaust\ndenial” was in use already in the early 1980s (Gleberzon\n1983). The term “climate change denial” became common\naround 2005 (e.g. Williams 2005). Other forms of science denial are\nrelativity theory denial, tobacco disease denial, hiv denialism, and\nvaccination denialism. \nMany forms of pseudoscience combine pseudo-theory promotion with\nscience denialism. For instance, creationism and its skeletal version\n“intelligent design” are constructed to support a\nfundamentalist interpretation of Genesis. However, as practiced today,\ncreationism has a strong focus on the repudiation of evolution, and it\nis therefore predominantly a form of science denialism. \nThe most prominent difference between pseudo-theory promotion and\nscience denial is their different attitudes to conflicts with\nestablished science. Science denialism usually proceeds by producing\nfalse controversies with legitimate science, i.e. claims that there is\na scientific controversy when there is in fact none. This is an old\nstrategy, applied already in the 1930s by relativity theory deniers\n(Wazeck 2009, 268–269). It has been much used by tobacco disease\ndeniers sponsored by the tobacco industry (Oreskes and Conway 2010;\nDunlap and Jacques 2013), and it is currently employed by climate\nscience denialists (Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Boykoff 2008). However,\nwhereas the fabrication of fake controversies is a standard tool in\nscience denial, it is seldom if ever used in pseudo-theory\npromotion. To the contrary, advocates of pseudosciences such as\nastrology and homeopathy tend to describe their theories as\nconformable to mainstream science. \nThe term scepticism (skepticism) has at least three distinct usages\nthat are relevant for the discussion on pseudoscience. First,\nscepticism is a philosophical method that proceeds by casting doubt on\nclaims usually taken to be trivially true, such as the existence of\nthe external world. This has been, and still is, a highly useful\nmethod for investigating the justification of what we in practice\nconsider to be certain beliefs. Secondly, criticism of pseudoscience\nis often called scepticism. This is the term most commonly used by\norganisations devoted to the disclosure of pseudoscience. Thirdly,\nopposition to the scientific consensus in specific areas is sometimes\ncalled scepticism. For instance, climate science deniers often call\nthemselves “climate sceptics”.  \nTo avoid confusion, the first of these notions can be specified as\n“philosophical scepticism”, the second as\n“scientific scepticism” or “defence of\nscience”, and the third as “science denial(ism)”.\nAdherents of the first two forms of scepticism can be called\n“philosophical sceptics”, respectively “science\ndefenders”. Adherents of the third form can be called\n“science deniers” or “science denialists”.\nTorcello (2016) proposed the term “pseudoscepticism” for\nso-called climate scepticism. \nUnwillingness to accept strongly supported factual statements is a\ntraditional criterion of pseudoscience. (See for instance item 5 on\nthe list of seven criteria cited in Section 4.6.) The term “fact\nresistance” or “resistance to facts” was used\nalready in the 1990s, for instance by Arthur Krystal (1999, p. 8), who\ncomplained about a “growing resistance to facts”,\nconsisting in people being “simply unrepentant about not knowing\nthings that do not reflect their interests”. The term\n“fact resistance” can refer to unwillingness to accept\nwell-supported factual claims whether or not that support originates\nin science. It is particularly useful in relation to fact-finding\npractices that are not parts of science. (Cf. Section 2.) \nGenerally speaking, conspiracy theories are theories according to\nwhich there exists some type of secret collusion for any type of\npurpose. In practice, the term mostly refers to implausible such\ntheories, used to explain social facts that have other, considerably\nmore plausible explanations. Many pseudosciences are connected with\nconspiracy theories. For instance, one of the difficulties facing\nanti-vaccinationists is that they have to explain the overwhelming\nconsensus among medical experts that vaccines are efficient. This is\noften done by claims of a conspiracy:\n \nConspiracy theories have peculiar epistemic characteristics that\ncontribute to their pervasiveness. (Keeley 1999) In particular, they\nare often associated with a type of circular reasoning that allows\nevidence against the conspiracy to be interpreted as evidence for\nit. \nThe term “bullshit” was introduced into philosophy by\nHarry Frankfurt (2005), who used it to describe a type of falsehood\nthat does not amount to lying. A person who lies deliberately chooses\nnot to tell the truth, whereas a person who utters bullshit is not\ninterested in whether what (s)he says is true or false, only in its\nsuitability for his or her purpose. Moberger (2020) has proposed that\npseudoscience should be seen as a special case of bullshit, understood\nas “a culpable lack of epistemic conscientiousness”.  \nEpistemic relativism is a term with many meanings; the meaning most\nrelevant in discussions on pseudoscience is denial of the common\nassumption that there is intersubjective truth in scientific matters,\nwhich scientists can and should try to approach. Epistemic relativists\nclaim that (natural) science has no special claim to knowledge, but\nshould be seen “as ordinary social constructions or as derived\nfrom interests, political-economic relations, class structure,\nsocially defined constraints on discourse, styles of persuasion, and\nso on” (Buttel and Taylor 1992, 220). Such ideas have been\npromoted under different names, including “social\nconstructivism”, the “strong programme”,\n“deconstructionism”, and “postmodernism”. The\ndistinction between science and pseudoscience has no obvious role in\nepistemic relativism. Some academic epistemic relativists have\nactively contributed to the promotion of doctrines such as AIDS\ndenial, vaccination denial, creationism, and climate science denial\n(Hansson 2020, Pennock 2010). However, the connection between\nepistemic relativism and pseudoscience is controversial. Some\nproponents of epistemic relativism have maintained that that\nrelativism “is almost always more useful to the side with less\nscientific credibility or cognitive authority” (Scott et\nal. 1990, 490). Others have denied that epistemic relativism\nfacilitates or encourages standpoints such as denial of anthropogenic\nclimate change or other environmental problems (Burningham and Cooper\n1999, 306). \nKuhn observed that although his own and Popper’s criteria of\ndemarcation are profoundly different, they lead to essentially the\nsame conclusions on what should be counted as science respectively\npseudoscience (Kuhn 1974, 803). This convergence of theoretically\ndivergent demarcation criteria is a quite general phenomenon.\nPhilosophers and other theoreticians of science differ widely in their\nviews on what science is. Nevertheless, there is virtual unanimity in\nthe community of knowledge disciplines on most particular issues of\ndemarcation. There is widespread agreement for instance that\ncreationism, astrology, homeopathy, Kirlian photography, dowsing,\nufology, ancient astronaut theory, Holocaust denialism, Velikovskian\ncatastrophism, and climate change denialism are pseudosciences. There\nare a few points of controversy, for instance concerning the status of\nFreudian psychoanalysis, but the general picture is one of consensus\nrather than controversy in particular issues of demarcation. \nIt is in a sense paradoxical that so much agreement has been reached\nin particular issues in spite of almost complete disagreement on the\ngeneral criteria that these judgments should presumably be based upon.\nThis puzzle is a sure indication that there is still much important\nphilosophical work to be done on the demarcation between science and\npseudoscience. \nPhilosophical reflection on pseudoscience has brought forth other\ninteresting problem areas in addition to the demarcation between\nscience and pseudoscience. Examples include related demarcations such\nas that between science and religion, the relationship between science\nand reliable non-scientific knowledge (for instance everyday\nknowledge), the scope for justifiable simplifications in science\neducation and popular science, the nature and justification of\nmethodological naturalism in science (Boudry et al 2010), and the\nmeaning or meaninglessness of the concept of a supernatural\nphenomenon. Several of these problem areas have as yet not received\nmuch philosophical attention.","contact.mail":"soh@kth.se","contact.domain":"kth.se"}]
