Epicurus believed that, on the basis\nof a radical materialism which dispensed with transcendent entities\nsuch as the Platonic Ideas or Forms, he could disprove the possibility\nof the soul’s survival after death, and hence the prospect of\npunishment in the afterlife. He regarded the unacknowledged fear of\ndeath and punishment as the primary cause of anxiety among human\nbeings, and anxiety in turn as the source of extreme and irrational\ndesires. The elimination of the fears and corresponding desires would\nleave people free to pursue the pleasures, both physical and mental, to\nwhich they are naturally drawn, and to enjoy the peace of mind that is\nconsequent upon their regularly expected and achieved satisfaction. It\nremained to explain how irrational fears arose in the first place:\nhence the importance of an account of social evolution. Epicurus was\naware that deeply ingrained habits of thought are not easily corrected,\nand thus he proposed various exercises to assist the novice. His system\nincluded advice on the proper attitude toward politics (avoid it where\npossible) and the gods (do not imagine that they concern themselves\nabout human beings and their behavior), the role of sex (dubious),\nmarriage (also dubious) and friendship (essential), reflections on the\nnature of various meteorological and planetary phenomena, about which\nit was best to keep an open mind in the absence of decisive\nverification, and explanations of such processes as gravity (that is, the tendency of objects to fall to the surface of the earth) and\nmagnetism, which posed considerable challenges to the ingenuity of the\nearlier atomists. Although the overall structure of Epicureanism was\ndesigned to hang together and to serve its principal ethical goals,\nthere was room for a great deal of intriguing philosophical argument\nconcerning every aspect of the system, from the speed of atoms in a\nvoid to the origin of optical illusions.\n\n\n\nThe major source for Epicurean doctrine is Diogenes Laertius’\nthird-century C.E. Lives of Eminent Philosophers, a compilation of\ninformation on the lives and doctrines of the philosophers of\nclassical Greece (see “Doxography of Ancient\nPhilosophy”). In the tenth and final book, devoted to\nEpicureanism, Diogenes preserves three of Epicurus’ letters to his\ndisciples, in which he presents his basic views in a concise and handy\nform. The Letter to Herodotus summarizes Epicurus’ physical theory,\nthe Letter to Menoeceus offers a précis of Epicurean ethics,\nand the Letter to Pythocles treats astronomical and meteorological\nmatters. (There is some doubt about whether the last is by Epicurus\nhimself or a follower, but there seems to be sufficient reason to\nattribute it to the founder himself.) Diogenes also quotes a\ncollection of brief sayings, called the “Principal\nBeliefs” or “Principal Doctrines” (Kuriai Doxai),\nexcerpted from the writings of Epicurus or, in some cases, of his\nclose associates; another such collection, partially overlapping with\nthe first, survives in an independent manuscript and is conventionally\ncalled the Vatican Sayings. The purpose of both sets, like that of the\nLetters, was to make the core doctrines easy to remember. Diogenes\nalso fills in topics not covered in the Letters, and provides a list\nof Epicurus’ writings and other biographical information. \n\nShort citations of Epicurus’ works appear in other writers (e.g.,\nPlutarch, Sextus Empiricus, and the Greek commentators on Aristotle),\noften taken out of context or presented in a polemical and distorted\nfashion. (The standard edition of Epicurus’ works in Greek is\nArrighetti 1973; the fullest collection of fragments and testimonies\nis still Usener 1887, repr. with Italian translation, Ramelli 2002;\nfor translations, see Bibliography: Editions, Translations,\nCommentaries). In addition, several works of Epicurus, including parts\nof his major treatise, On Nature (Peri\nphuseôs) — a series of lectures running to 37 papyrus\nrolls — have been recovered in damaged condition from the\nlibrary of a villa in the town of Herculaneum, which was buried in the\neruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 C.E. The library almost certainly\ncontained the working collection of Philodemus, an Epicurean\nphilosopher from Syria who studied in Athens and moved to Italy in the\nfirst century B.C.E. Many of the rolls consist of Philodemus’ own\nwritings, and provide valuable information about later issues in the\nhistory of Epicureanism. One must be cautious about ascribing these\nviews to the founder himself, although the school tended to be\nconservative and later thinkers embellished rather than altered\nEpicurus’ own teachings. New editions and translations are now making\nthese difficult texts available to a wider readership. \n\nMore or less contemporary with Philodemus is Lucretius (first century\nB.C.E.), who composed in Latin De rerum natura (“On the\nNature of Things”; the title, if it is Lucretius’ own, is an\nadaptation of “On Nature”) in six books of hexameter\nverse, the meter characteristic of epic and didactic poetry. As a\ndedicated Epicurean, passionate to promulgate the message of the\nfounder, Lucretius reproduced Epicurean doctrine faithfully (Sedley\n1998; Clay 1983 allows Lucretius more originality). His poem\nconcentrates principally on the physical and psychological or\nepistemological aspects of Epicureanism, and to a great extent omits\nthe ethical. From a hostile point of view, Cicero rehearsed and\ncriticized Epicurus’ ideas, especially concerning ethics, in several\nof his philosophical works, including On Moral Ends (De\nfinibus) and the Tusculan Disputations. Still later, in\nthe second century C.E., another Diogenes erected a large inscription,\nto this day only partially excavated, in the city of Oenoanda (in\nsouthwestern Turkey), which contained the basic tenets of Epicureanism\n(authoritative edition by Smith 1993, but new fragments have been\npublished subsequently; see also Gordon 1996, Hammerstaedt et alii, 2017). \n“Epicurus, the son of Neocles and Chaerestrata, was an Athenian\nfrom the deme of Gargettus and the lineage of the Philaïdes, as\nMetrodorus says in his On Noble Families. Heraclides, among\nothers, in his epitome of Sotion, says that he was raised in Samos,\nsince the Athenians were given parcels of land there, but came to\nAthens when he was eighteen, when Xenocrates was head of the Academy\nand Aristotle was still in Chalcis” (where he died in 322). So\nbegins the account by Diogenes Laertius (10.1). The dates for\nEpicurus’ birth and first move to Athens are thus 341 B.C.E. and 323\nrespectively. Diogenes adds that after the death of Alexander (323),\nwhen the Athenians were expelled from Samos, Epicurus left Athens and\njoined his father in Colophon (in 321), on the coast of what is now\nTurkey. Here he studied philosophy under the tutelage of Nausiphanes,\na Democritean philosopher with skeptical leanings, and author of a\nwork called the\nTripod, on which Epicurus reportedly drew for\nhis Canon, his principal work on epistemology; in ethics,\nNausiphanes substituted the term\nakataplêxia (“undauntability”) for Democritus’\nathambiê, “fearlessness,” as crucial to the good\nlife, which invites comparison with Epicurus’ ataraxia or\n“imperturbability,” though Epicurus is said to have denied\nhaving been influenced by him (On Nausiphanes’ role in transmitting\nelements of Democritean doctrine to Epicurus, see Warren 2002:\n160–92.) \n\nTen years later, Epicurus moved to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos,\nand soon proceeded to Lampsacus on the nearby mainland; in both cities\nhe taught and gathered followers before returning again to Athens in\n307/06, where he remained until his death in 270, at the age of\nseventy or seventy-one. In Athens, he purchased the property that\nbecame known as the “Garden” (later used as a name for his\nschool itself) and began to develop his own school in\nearnest. Diogenes reports a number of slanderous stories that were\ncirculated by Epicurus’ opponents, despite which he affirms that\nEpicurus was of an extraordinarily humane disposition; this was the\nprevailing view, shared even by hostile witnesses to\nEpicureanism. Diogenes also records Epicurus’ will (10.16–21),\nin which, among other things, he made provisions for the children of\nhis friends and appointed a successor. \n\nEpicurus held that the elementary constituents of nature are\nundifferentiated matter, in the form of discrete, solid and\nindivisible particles (“atoms”) below the threshold of\nperception, plus empty space, that is, the complement of matter or\nwhere matter is not (Inwood 1981, Konstan 2014; contra Sedley 1982,\nwho argues that space, for Epicurus, is a continuous matrix extending\nuniformly throughout the universe, and is either occupied by matter or\nempty). In its broad outline, Epicurus inherited this scheme from the\nearlier atomists, above all Democritus. But Democritus’ version had\nbeen the object of critiques by later thinkers, especially Aristotle,\nin part for incoherencies in the notion of an infinite void, in part\nfor problems attaching to his idea of minima, or entities of the\nsmallest conceivable size (see especially Physics Book\n6). First, freestanding entities of minimal size could have no edges,\nand so no shapes, or rather would be all edge: thus, if two minima\ntouched, they would wholly overlap. (The same argument applies to\npoints in a line, which is why a line contains points but is not\ncomposed of them, according to Aristotle.)  Further, if atoms really\nare conceptually indivisible, and not just physically unsplittable,\nthen when two atoms pass by each other it is impossible that they\nshould at any time be only partway past, for this would imply a point\npartway along the length of the atom, which contradicts the premise\nthat it is a minimum.  Although Aristotle does not state the argument\nprecisely in this form, it is apparent that a strict conception of\nminimal-sized atoms entails that motion too must consist of\ndiscontinuous quanta; and if motion, then time. Atoms must, then,\nAristotle inferred, move in discrete hops (kinêmata),\neach one occupying a single temporal minimum — and hence, all\natoms must move at a uniform speed. An infinite void, with atoms\ndistributed throughout it, led to problems of its own, for it permits\nno intrinsic spatial orientation and hence no account of why things\nfall, as they are observed to do. \n\nThe problem for Epicurus was to find a way of explaining the natural\nphenomena of bodily movement while responding to the challenges posed\nby Aristotle’s criticisms of Democritus’ theory. Epicurus rose to the\nchallenge, although one cannot be certain that he was responding\ndirectly to Aristotle’s critique. (It is unclear whether or how much\nphilosophers of Epicurus’ generation who were not members of\nAristotle’s own school had access to Aristotle’s treatises.) \n\nFirst, he distinguished between the atom, which by its nature cannot\nbe broken apart, and the minimum conceivable expanse of matter: atoms\nhave such minima as parts, but are not minima themselves — there\ncan be no free-standing entity one minimum expanse in size. This\nresolves the problem of atomic edges, and also that of how atoms can\ncome in different shapes and sizes (though never large enough to be\nseen): to have the hooks and crevices needed to form compounds, they\ncan scarcely be theoretically partless. Second, Epicurus agreed that\ntime too is discontinuous, as is motion: Simplicius\n(p. 934.23–30 Diels; translation in Konstan 1989) quotes him as\naffirming that it is untrue to say that an atom is moving over a\nminimum interval, but only that it has moved (some scholars maintain\nthat this is a later innovation in the school; see especially Verde\n2013). What is more, as Aristotle had argued must be the case, atoms\nall move at the same velocity (the principle\nof isotakheia). This last claim entailed difficulties of its\nown, such as how atoms ever overtake each other, if they are moving in\nthe same direction.  (Lucretius invoked the idea of a random swerve to\nsolve this one; see below.) But it also provided a solution to another\nproblem, that of entropy: for since atoms can never slow down, the\nuniverse can never come to a halt (in modern terms, there is no loss\nof energy). As for gravity, Epicurus may have had a solution to this\ntoo, and in a novel form. If an atom just on its own cannot slow down\nor alter its direction of motion, then an atom that is rising or\nmoving in an oblique direction cannot at some point begin to tilt or\nfall, unless something blocks its progress and forces it to do so. If,\nhowever, after a collision atoms tended to emerge in a statistically\nfavored direction — that is, if the motions of all atoms after\ncollisions did not cancel each other out but on average produced a\nvector, however small, in a given direction, then that direction would\nby definition be down. The absence of a global orientation in the\nuniverse was thus immaterial. Due to this vector, any given world\nwill, like our own, be similarly oriented in respect to\nthe direction “down.” (Given the infinite expanse of the universe on Epicurean\ntheory — see below — we must expect there to be a\nplurality of worlds, some like ours, some — within limits\n— different.) \n\nMacroscopic objects, of course, do not move at a uniform and very\ngreat speed; the atoms within them do, but their motions are restricted\nand deflected by neighboring atoms, and so they vibrate. In the case of\ncompound objects that are completely at rest, the resultant of internal\natomic motions is zero, relative, at least, to the earth, which may\nhave an average motion of its own. If so, and if for some reason the\nearth’s motion is slower in a downward direction than that of objects\non or near its surface — because, say, the earth is disk-shaped, as\nEpicurus held, and hence sinks more slowly in the surrounding atomic\nmedium, like a falling leaf — then Epicurus could explain as well why\nthings like stones tend to fall to the earth’s surface when let go. \n\nEpicurus operated with a highly limited number of elementary\nprinciples in nature — he did not know the concept of force, for\nexample, or the associated ideas of attraction and repulsion among\natoms, not to mention more arcane properties — and for all his\nefforts to account for all the physical features of the world on the\nbasis of this theory, paradoxes remained. An excellent one is posed by\nSextus Empiricus (Against the Physicists = M\n10.144–48), which at the same time gives an idea of how\nEpicurean atoms were understood to behave (at least in Sextus’ time,\nlate 2nd century AD).  Sextus imagined two atoms separated\nby a distance of nine minima, traveling at the same speed (as atoms\nmust) toward each other; after four temporal minima, the atoms would\nbe one spatial minimum apart.  Then what? They cannot meet in the\nmiddle of the remaining distance, by the very concept of a\nminimum. Nor can one cross the interval before the other, without\nviolating the rule of equal velocity. But how, then, can they meet at\nall? We do not know an Epicurean reply to this conundrum. Perhaps\natoms are always an even number of minimal spaces apart from one\nanother. Or else, minima are always bundled in such large quantities\nthat it is meaningless to speak of an odd or even number of minima\nbetween atoms; the Stoics, at all events, held that whether the number\nof stars, for example, is odd or even is absolutely or naturally\nnon-evident (kathapax adela, Sextus Empiricus Outline of\nPyrrhonism = PH 2.97, M 8.147; physei\nadela, M 8.317–18). But Epicurus believed that\nmotion at the atomic level obeyed different laws from those that\nappear to operate at the level of macroscopic objects (that atomic\nmotion is discontinuous is an example). Perhaps, then, motions over\nsmall numbers of minima were in some sense indiscernible. Finally, it\nis possible that he discounted such a puzzle as a purely mathematical\nparadox, since it is recorded that he had little interest in\nmathematics as a separate science from physics and believed it to be\nirrelevant to the proper study of physics. \n\nFascinating as these questions are in their own right, Epicurus\nhimself does not proceed by creating an abstract model, exploring its\ninternal coherence, and determining its applicability to phenomena, in\nthe ideal manner of modern science. Rather, he begins with the\ntestimony of the senses, which he thinks are always reliable. These\nprovide a basis on which to draw conclusions either with respect to\nthings that still await confirmation or those that are by nature\nimperceptible (Letter to Herodotus = LH 38). Thus,\nin beginning his account of the physical world in this Letter, he\nargues that things cannot arise out of nothing, since otherwise there\nwould be no need of specific seeds for specific plants and animals,\nand anything whatsoever could be generated out of just any types of\nmaterial elements. Since this is not seen to happen, but reproduction\nin things we can observe with our senses is in fact orderly and\ndeterminate, spontaneous generation at any level is ruled out. The\nlogic is what Epicurus calls counterwitnessing: a hypothetical premise\n(here, that things sometimes arise out of nothing) is eliminated\nbecause experience tells against its conclusion (here, that the coming\ninto being of visible objects does not require determinate seeds or\nmaterials). More simply, if A then B; but not\nB, hence not A. One might, of course, challenge the\nimplication: something might arise from nothing, even if there are no\ncases of chickens giving birth to horses. The important point,\nhowever, is that Epicurus invokes the data of perception to testify\nfor or against the nature of elementary phenomena; he assumes a\ncertain uniformity of nature at all levels. So too with his next\npostulate: things are not destroyed into what is not, since in that\ncase everything would cease to exist (and would have ceased to exist\nbefore now, given infinite past time — recall that nothing is\ncreated out of nothing); but things do exist, hence the premise is\nfalse. \n\nAs for bodies (note the plural: Epicurus does not typically speak of\nmatter per se) and void as the basic physical principles, the senses,\nEpicurus affirms, testify to the existence of bodies, and by\ncalculation on the basis of the senses we infer the nature of what is\ninvisible, for example the atoms (LH 39). Here the reasoning\nis based on analogy: what is evident to our senses must be true on the\nmicroscopic level as well, at least in some respects. Void must exist,\nin turn, if bodies are to be able to move, as they are seen to\ndo. Thus motion is the counterwitness to the non-existence of void\n— an indirect argument is required since one cannot perceive\nempty space.  What is more, since bodies, being “full,”\noffer resistance and void, being empty, offers no resistance, they\ncomplement each other and exhaust the possibilities; hence it is\nimpossible to conceive of anything besides these two principles, apart\nfrom things that are accidents of them — accidents that arise\nfrom unions of elementary bodies in the void. (Inconceivability is\nanother tool in Epicurus’ method of demonstration.) These elementary\nbodies, then, are the atoms, which are indivisible and inalterable, if\nthings are not to dissolve into nothingness. The Letter to\nHerodotus is an epitome of Epicurean doctrine, and the arguments\nare crisp and abbreviated, but the reasoning is clear, and is\nconfirmed by the more detailed treatment in Lucretius, which almost\ncertainly follows Epicurus’ On Nature (see Leone\n2012). Epicurus appeals to some elementary intuitions concerning\nbodies and their movement through space in order to establish the\nstructure of imperceptibly small things; he concludes that these must\nbe inalterable if nature is not to dissolve into nothing (creation\nback out of nothing having already been eliminated by the argument\ncited above from regularity in generation); and the basic features of\nthe atomic system are then in place. A similar appeal to the senses\nestablishes the infinity of the universe, since what is finite must\nhave an edge, and an edge is conceived in reference to something\nbeyond it. But the universe — in Greek, the “all”\n— contains everything, and so there is nothing outside it by\nwhich to conceive an edge. Hence, it is infinite.  And if the all is\ninfinite, so is the void and the number of atoms as well, for\notherwise atoms would be too widely dispersed ever to meet\n(LH 41–42). \n\nEpicurus now has in place the fundamental constituents of his\nnatural world, and he might have stopped here, with atoms and void and\nthe denial, on the grounds of inconceivability, of any other kind of\nbasic physical principle. All secondary properties, such as color and\ntaste, will be explained as epiphenomena of atomic combinations, and\nperception of things at a distance by the continual emission of\ninfinitesimally thin laminas from objects, which maintain the relevant\nfeatures of the source (in the case of vision, for example, the laminas\nwill preserve the atomic patterns specific to the color and shape of\nthe object) and directly stimulate the relevant sense organ. This is a\ntricky thesis, and again posed puzzles: how do the lamina or simulacra,\nas Lucretius called them, of a mountain enter the eye, for example? In\nfragments? By somehow shrinking? We do not know the answer to this one.\nA few more concepts fill in the picture of the natural world: thus,\nEpicurus denies that there can be infinitely many kinds of atoms, for\nthen all shapes (which define the kinds) at any given magnitude would\nbe exhausted and atoms would have to reach visible proportions, which\nwe know that they do not (this argument depends on the idea of minima,\ndiscussed further below); instead, the number of kinds (i.e., shapes of\nvarious microscopic sizes) is inconceivably large but “not strictly\ninfinite,” whereas the number of each kind of atom is simply infinite\n(LH 55–56). This condition is also invoked to explain why there is a\nlimit on possible types of combinations of atoms, and hence on the\nnumber of viable species of things in the perceptible world: if there\nwere infinitely many kinds of atoms, Epicurus believed, they could\ncombine to generate absolutely anything — an infinity of different\nsorts of thing. \n\nBut an infinite number of solid and therefore indivisible atoms of\nfinitely many kinds, such as Epicurus’ theory provides, are enough to\navoid the possibility of the universe crumbling into nothing. Why did\nEpicurus complicate matters still further with the doctrine that atoms\nthemselves consist of still smaller parts in the form of\nmathematically minimal expanses, as we saw above that he does? Finite\nbodies, according to Epicurus, had to be composed of smaller expanses,\nand if there were no lower limit in size to such expanses, one would\nhave to imagine traversing such a body in an infinite number of moves\n— but then, however small these infinitesimals might be, the\nobject that contained them, Epicurus reasoned, would have to be\ninfinitely large (LH 56–57). What are such minima like?\nEpicurus asks us to think of the smallest perceptible thing. It\ndiffers from larger visible entities in that it has no sub-parts to be\ntraversed with the eye: if you do attempt to visualize such sub-parts,\nthey simply coincide with the original perceptible minimum. Since such\nminimal visible entities have no parts, they do not touch edge to edge\n(edges are parts), and yet they measure out the body that contains\nthem, larger bodies having more such minima. By analogy with the\nvisible, then, we conceive of the smallest part of an atom\n(LH 58–59). This conception resembles the way points\nexist in a line, according to Aristotle, since they too do not touch,\nnor can they exist independently. But Epicurean minima differ from\npoints in that they are physical expanses and so have extension.  This\nlooks like a contradictory state of affairs: can we imagine, for\nexample, an atom consisting of just two minima? Or ten? It would be\nlike counting up the least visible bits of a perceptible object.\nGeometrical problems arise as well, since it was known that the side\nand diagonal of a cube, for example, were incommensurable, yet both\nmust, it would appear, be composed of finite and hence commensurable\nnumbers of minima. On the assumption that Epicurus was aware of and\ncared about such puzzles, it has been suggested that he thought any\natom consists of a not strictly infinite, but inconceivably large\n— and so “not strictly finite” — number of\nminima (see Konstan 1989a): thus, the minimum may be imagined as the\ninverse of the number of kinds of atoms postulated by Epicurus, a\nquantity that takes on a quasi-technical status as a special order of\nmagnitude. But sufficient evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. \n\nHaving established the physical basis of the world, Epicurus proceeds\nto explain the nature of the soul (this, at least, is the order in\nwhich Lucretius sets things out). This too, of course, consists of\natoms: first, there is nothing that is not made up of atoms and void\n(secondary qualities are simply accidents of the arrangement of\natoms), and second, an incorporeal entity could neither act on nor be\nmoved by bodies, as the soul is seen to do (e.g., it is conscious of\nwhat happens to the body, and it initiates physical\nmovement). Epicurus maintains that soul atoms are particularly fine\nand are distributed throughout the body (LH 64), and it is by\nmeans of them that we have sensations (aisthêseis) and\nthe experience of pain and pleasure, which Epicurus\ncalls pathê (a term used by Aristotle and others to\nsignify emotions instead). Body without soul atoms is unconscious and\ninert, and when the atoms of the body are disarranged so that it can\nno longer support conscious life, the soul atoms are scattered and no\nlonger retain the capacity for sensation (LH 65). There is\nalso a part of the human soul that is concentrated in the chest, and\nis the seat of the higher intellectual functions. The distinction is\nimportant, because it is in the rational part that error of judgment\nenters in. Sensation, like pain and pleasure, is incorrigible just\nbecause it is a function of the non-rational part, which does not\nmodify a perception — that is, the reception of lamina emitted\nfrom macroscopic bodies — by the addition of opinion or\nbelief. \n\nThe corporeal nature of the soul has two crucial consequences for\nEpicureanism. First, it is the basis of Epicurus’ demonstration that\nthe soul does not survive the death of the body (other arguments to\nthis effect are presented in Lucretius 3.417–614). The soul’s\ntexture is too delicate to exist independently of the body that\ncontains it, and in any case the connection with the body is necessary\nfor sensation to occur. From this it follows that there can be no\npunishment after death, nor any regrets for the life that has been\nlost. Second, the soul is responsive to physical impressions, whether\nthose that arrive from without in the form of laminas or simulacra, or\nthose that arise from internal motions of the body. No phenomena are\npurely mental, in the sense of being disembodied states or objects of\npure consciousness conceived as separate from embodiment. The\nelementary sensations of pleasure and pain, accordingly, rather than\nabstract moral principles or abstract concepts of goodness or badness,\nare the fundamental guides to what is good and bad, since all sentient\ncreatures are naturally attracted to the one and repelled by the\nother. The function of the human mind — that part of the soul that is\nlocated in our chest — is not to seek higher things, but to\nmaximize pleasure and minimize pain. That is its entire objective; the\nrisk (a substantial one) is that it may miscalculate, since it is\nsubject to false beliefs and errors in cognitive processes. \n\nUnlike other Hellenistic schools, such as those of Aristotle and the\nStoics, the Epicureans were not greatly interested in formal logic,\nbut they certainly needed a theory of the formation of beliefs. As far\nas the ideational content of thinking — that is, the thought of\nsomething — is concerned, Epicurus proposed a radically\nreductive hypothesis: just as sensations occur as a result of thin\nfilms emitted by objects that enter the appropriate sense organ, so\ntoo some of these simulacra are fine enough to penetrate directly to\nthe mind (located in the chest), and that is how we imagine such\nobjects (e.g., gods). This process is invoked to explain not only\ndream images, but many kinds of mental impression, including\nimpressions constituting voluntary thought: the latter occurs when we\nattend to one or another of the exiguous physical films that are\ncontinuously floating through the air. (How we manage to attend\nvoluntarily to whichever of these films we choose is not explained in\nthe surviving sources.) Imagining a thing is thus nothing more than\npicking out the simulacra that have been emitted by it, and which may\nendure beyond the life of the thing itself (hence we can imagine the\ndead). These mental images have no privileged status, such as Plato\ngave to his noetic Ideas or Forms; they are always true, but in this\ndo not differ from the information provided by the senses.  Mistakes\noccur here too when the wrong beliefs are associated with such\nimpressions, for example, that because we have a mental image of a\ndead person it follows that he or she still exists in a ghostly form.\nEpicurean physics proves that this is impossible. \n\nA great barrier to correct thinking is language itself, which, because\nit has a name for death, may suggest that death (being dead) is\nsomething a person can experience and hence deserves to be feared.\nWords must be understood in their basic sense, Epicurus says, as\nopposed to what he calls “empty sounds” (LH 37). The\nculprit in misunderstanding is always an illegitimate inference from\nsensation (the latter including thoughts produced by film-like\nimages). An example is the belief that centaurs exist. Epicurus does\nnot deny that the thought of a centaur corresponds to some real\nstimulus in the form of simulacra: his theory of knowledge commits him\nto the view that it must. But the flimsy laminas as they float through\nthe air can become distorted or interfere with one another, and thus\nthe upper part of a human figure may get loosely attached to the lower\npart of a horse’s.  We know that this is unreal because such a\ncombination is physically impossible: horses and human beings mature\nat different rates, for example, and eat different foods (see\nLucretius 5.878–91; cf.  Palaephatus On Incredible Tales\n20). Beliefs about whether sensations correspond to an actually\nexisting thing must be tested against knowledge of the world, as\ninformed by Epicurean theory. \n\nThe ability to reason or calculate (logismos) cannot be a\nfunction of images. It is the faculty that lets us infer by analogy\nfrom the visible world to the invisible, and also that with which we\nmay recognize that not all pleasures are to be chosen at all times,\nsince some immediate pleasures may lead to long-term pain or harm\n(Letter to Menoeceus = LM 129). What is more, one\nmust know something about the nature of pleasure in order to pursue it\nrationally, and likewise for pain. Epicurus, it appears, uses the\nterms pleasure and pain\n(hêdonê, algêdôn) strictly\nin reference to physical pathê or sensations, that is,\nthose that are experienced via the non-rational soul that is\ndistributed throughout the body. As for the rational part or mind, we\nhave positive and negative experiences through it too. Most prominent\namong the negative mental states is fear, above all the fear of unreal\ndangers, such as death.  Death, Epicurus insists, is nothing to us,\nsince while we exist, our death is not, and when our death occurs, we\ndo not exist (LM 124–25); but if one is frightened by\nthe empty name of death, the fear will persist since we must all\neventually die. This fear is one source of perturbation\n(tarakhê), and is a worse curse than physical pain\nitself; the absence of such fear is ataraxy, lack of perturbation, and\nataraxy, together with freedom from physical pain, is one way of\nspecifying the goal of life, for Epicurus. \n\nThere are also positive states of mind, which Epicurus identifies by\nthe special term khara (joy), as opposed\nto hêdonê (pleasure, i.e., physical\npleasure). These states too depend on belief, whether true or\nfalse. But Epicurus does not treat khara as an end, or part\nof the end for living: rather, he tends to describe the goal by\nnegation, as freedom from bodily pain and mental disturbance\n(LM 128).  However, happiness (eudaimonia),\naccording to Epicurus, is not simply a neutral or privative condition\nbut rather a form of pleasure in its own right — what Epicurus\ncalled catastematic or (following Cicero’s Latin translation)\n“static” as opposed to “kinetic”\npleasure. Although the precise nature of this distinction is debated,\nkinetic pleasures seem to be of the non-necessary kind (see below),\nsuch as those resulting from agreeable odors or sounds, rather than\nderiving from replenishment, as in the case of hunger or thirst. The\nphilosophical school known as the Cyrenaics advocated increasing\ndesires and seeking ever new ways of gratifying them. \n\nEpicurus objected that such pleasures are necessarily accompanied by\ndistress, for they depend upon a lack that is painful (Plato had\ndemonstrated the problematic nature of this kind of pleasure; see\nGorgias 496C–497A, Philebus 31E–32D,\n46A–50C). In addition, augmenting desires tends to intensify\nrather than reduce the mental agitation (a distressful state of mind)\nthat Epicurean philosophy sought to eliminate. Catastematic pleasure,\non the contrary, is (or is taken in) a state rather than a process: it\nis the pleasure that accompanies well-being as such. The Cyrenaics and\nothers, such as Cicero, maintained, in turn, that this condition is\nnot pleasurable but rather neutral — neither pleasurable nor\npainful. \n\nFor Epicurus, there are some fears that are perfectly legitimate; so\ntoo are some desires. Epicurus offers a classification of desires into\nthree types: some are natural, others are empty; and natural desires\nare of two sorts, those that are necessary and those that are merely\nnatural (see Cooper 1999). Natural and necessary are those that look\nto happiness, physical well-being, or life itself (LM\n127). Unnecessary but natural desires are for pleasant things like\nsweet odors and good-tasting food and drink (and for various\npleasurable activities of sorts other than simple smelling, touching\nand tasting). Empty desires are those that have as their objects\nthings designated by empty sounds, such as immortality, which cannot\nexist for human beings and do not correspond to any genuine need. The\nsame holds for the desire for great wealth or for marks of fame, such\nas statues: they cannot provide the security that is the genuine\nobject of the desire. Such desires, accordingly, can never be\nsatisfied, any more than the corresponding fears — e.g., the\nfear of death — can ever be alleviated, since neither has a\ngenuine referent, i.e., death as something harmful (when it is\npresent, we do not exist) or wealth and power as salves for\nanxiety. Such empty fears and desires, based on what Epicurus calls\nkenodoxia or empty belief, are themselves the main source of\nperturbation and pain in civilized life, where more elementary dangers\nhave been brought under control, since they are the reason why people\nare driven to strive for limitless wealth and power,\nsubjecting themselves to the very dangers they imagine they are\navoiding. \n\nAlthough human beings, like everything else, are composed of atoms\nthat move according to their fixed laws, our actions are not wholly\npredetermined — rather than entertain such a paralyzing\ndoctrine, Epicurus says, it would be better to believe in the old\nmyths, for all their perversities (LM 134). What enables us to wrest\nliberty from a mechanistic universe is the existence of a certain\nrandomness in the motion of atoms, that takes the form of a minute\nswerve in their forward course (evidence for this doctrine derives\nchiefly from later sources, including Lucretius and Cicero). It is not\nentirely clear how the swerve operates: it may involve a small angle\nof deviation from the original path, or else a slight shift sideways,\nperhaps by a single minimum, with no change in direction. The idea of\nsuch a minute veering, said to occur at no determinate time or place,\nis less strange in the modern age of quantum physics than it was in\nEpicurus’ time, and it gave rise to mocking critiques. More\nproblematic today is how the swerve might explain freedom of will\n— if indeed Epicurus’ idea of the will was like our own. It did,\nat all events, introduce an indeterminacy into the universe, and if\nsoul atoms, thanks to their fineness, were more susceptible to the\neffects of such deviations than coarser matter, the swerve could at\nleast represent a breach in any strict predestination of human\nbehavior. And this might have been enough for Epicurus’ purposes: he\nmay not have invoked the swerve in order to explain voluntary action\n(claiming that it is action deriving, immediately or ultimately, from\na swerve or some swerves of the soul’s atoms). He may have wished\nmerely to establish the possibility of action not deriving from the\npositions of the soul’s constituent atoms at any time plus the effects\nof collisions among them resulting from their given movements at that\ntime. According to Lucretius (2.225–50), the swerve was also put\nto use to solve a cosmological problem: if at some (as it were)\ninitial moment all atoms were moving uniformly in a single direction\n(downward) at the same speed, it is impossible to conceive how the\nprocess of atomic collisions could have begun, save by some such\ndevice. This seems a curious idea: given that time, like space, was\ninfinite according to Epicurus, he need not have imagined a time prior\nto collisions. Just possibly the tendency of atoms to emerge from\ncollisions in a preferred direction (by definition “down”)\nmight lead over time to local regions of parallel motion, and the\nswerve could serve to reintroduce contact among them. In any event,\nEpicurus may have thought of atoms moving in some uniform direction\nrather than in diverse ones as a default position for physical theory\n(because of the simplicity of that hypothesis); thus he may have felt\nthe need to explain how the diversity of the atoms’ motions could have\narisen. \n\nAlthough our main witness for Epicurus’ views on the evolution of\nhuman society is Lucretius’ poem (5.925–1457), there is no doubt\nthat Lucretius was following, in the main, the ideas of the founder\nhimself, as recorded in Epicurus’ On Nature and other treatises. In\nthe beginning, human beings were solitary; they reproduced\nhaphazardly, could not communicate verbally, had no social\ninstitutions, and survived because they were physically hardier than\ntheir modern descendants. With time, the race softened, thanks in part\nto the discovery of fire, in part too to the emergence of the family\nand the gentler sentiments toward spouses and offspring to which the\nfamily gave rise. At this stage, human beings were in a position to\nunite in order to fend off natural dangers, such as wild beasts, and\nthey developed various kinds of technical skills, such as agriculture\nand the building of houses, as well as language. Epicurus explains (LH\n75–76) that names at first arose naturally, in the sense that as\nhuman beings experienced different affects (pathê) or received\nvarious images (phantasmata) they emitted air corresponding to these\nstimuli; since human physical characteristics vary somewhat from place\nto place, however, the sounds people produced in response to any given\nstimulus similarly differed, which explains why there are many\ntongues. Upon this basis, people later, nation by nation, established\ncertain terms by convention for the purpose of improving clarity and\nbrevity in communication. Finally, certain individual experts further\naugmented the vocabulary by the introduction of new and specialized\nwords, to explain the results of their theoretical\ninvestigations. Once language reached a developed state, people began\nto establish alliances and friendships, which contributed further to\ncollective security. \n\nThis early form of social life had various advantages: among others,\nthe relative scarcity of goods prevented excessive competition\n(sharing was obligatory for survival) and thereby set limits on those\nunnatural desires that at a later, richer phase of society would lead\nto wars and other disturbances. It would appear too that, before\nlanguage had developed fully, words more or less conformed to their\noriginal or primitive objects, and were not yet a source of mental\nconfusion. But thanks to a gradual accumulation of wealth, the\nstruggle over goods came to infect social relations, and there emerged\nkings or tyrants who ruled over others not by virtue of their physical\nstrength but by dint of gold. These autocrats in turn were overthrown,\nand after a subsequent period of violent anarchy people finally saw\nthe wisdom of living under the rule of law. This might seem to\nrepresent the highest attainment in political organization, but that\nis not so for the Epicureans. For with law came the generalized fear\nof punishment that has contaminated the blessings of life (Lucretius\n5.1151; cf.  [Philodemus] On Choices and Avoidances\ncol. XII). Lucretius at this point gives an acount of the origin of\nreligious superstition and dread of the gods, and although he does not\nrelate this anxiety directly to the fear of punishment under human\nlaw, he does state that thunder and lightning are interpreted as signs\nthat the gods are angry at human sins (5.1218–25). While\nprimitive people in the presocial or early communal stages might have\nbeen awed by such manifestations of natural power and ascribed them to\nthe action of the gods, they would not necessarily have explained them\nas chastisement for human crimes before the concept of punishment\nbecame familiar under the regime of law.  People at an early time knew\nthat gods exist thanks to the simulacra that they give off, although\nthe precise nature of the gods according to Epicurus remains obscure\n(for contrasting intepretations, see Konstan 2011 and Sedley 2011);\nbut the gods, for him, do not interest themselves in human affairs,\nsince this would compromise their beatitude (see Obbink 1996:\n321–23). \n\nIf one does not fear the gods, what motive is there for living justly?\nWhere law obtains, Epicurus indicates, it is preferable not to commit\ncrimes, even secret ones, since there will always be anxiety over the\npossibility of detection, and this will disrupt the tranquillity or\nataraxy that is the chief basis of happiness in life\n(see Principal Beliefs = KD 34–35). Justice,\nfor Epicurus, depends on the capacity to make compacts neither to harm\nothers nor be harmed by them, and consists precisely in these\ncompacts; justice is nothing in itself, independent of such\narrangements (KD 31–33). According to Epicurus\n(LM 132, KD 5), someone who is incapable of living\nprudently, honorably, and justly cannot live pleasurably, and vice\nversa. Moreover, prudence or wisdom (phronêsis) is the\nchief of the virtues: on it depend all the rest. This again sounds\ncalculating, as though justice were purely a pragmatic and selfish\nmatter of remaining unperturbed.  Epicurus does not entertain the\nthought experiment proposed by Plato in the Republic\n(359C–360D), in which Plato asks whether a person who is\nabsolutely secure from punishment would have reason to be just. Did\nEpicurus have an answer to such a challenge? He may simply have denied\nthat anyone can be perfectly confident in this way. Perhaps, however,\nhe did have a reply, but it was derived from the domain of psychology\nrather than of ethics. A person who understands what is desirable and\nwhat is to be feared would not be motivated to acquire inordinate\nwealth or power, but would lead a peaceful life to the extent\npossible, avoiding politics and the general fray. An Epicurean sage,\naccordingly, would have no motive to violate the rights of\nothers. Whether the sage would be virtuous is perhaps moot; what\nEpicurus says is that he would live virtuously, that is prudently,\nhonorably, and justly (the adverbial construction may be\nsignificant). He would do so not because of an acquired disposition\nor hexis, as Aristotle had it, but because he knows how to\nreason correctly about his needs. Hence his desires would be limited\nto those that are natural (not empty), and so easily satisfied, or at\nleast not a source of disturbance if sometimes unsatisfied. \n\nEpicurus placed an extremely high value on friendship (or love:\nphilia). A saying with rather a more poetic flair than is Epicurus’\ncustom runs: “Friendship goes dancing round the world,\nannouncing to all of us to wake up to happiness” (Vatican Saying\n= VS 52). Epicurus held that a wise man would feel the torture of a\nfriend no less than his own, and would die for a friend rather than\nbetray him, for otherwise his own life would be confounded (VS\n56–57). These are powerfully altruistic sentiments for a\nphilosopher who posits as the unique goal in life happiness based on\nfreedom from physical pain and mental anxiety. Epicurus could justify\nsuch an attitude by the same prudential calculus that he uses to argue\nin favor of living justly: only by living in such a way that loyalty\nto friends is perceived to be a consummate value will one be able to\nfeel secure in one’s friends, and thus maximize one’s felicity. Yet\nthis does not seem quite what Epicurus means when he says that\n“friendship [or love] had its beginning as a result of utility,\nbut is to be chosen [or is a virtue, if we follow the manuscript\nreading] for its own sake” (VS 23). The question is further\ncomplicated by the report in Cicero’s On Moral Ends (1.66–70)\nthat there was a difference of opinion concerning friendship among\nlater Epicureans. Since human beings were originally asocial and only\nlater learned to form alliances and compacts, it is possible that\nEpicurus means to say that this capacity for friendship arose out of\nneed, but that once the capacity for such feelings was acquired,\nfeeling them came to be valued in itself. The argument would be\nsimilar to the modern idea that altruism could have developed as a\nresult of natural selection. But the evidence does not permit a firm\nconclusion on this matter. \n\nWhen Epicurus spoke of friendship, he may have had at least partly in\nmind specifically the relationship among his followers, who seem to\nhave thought of themselves as friends. Epicureans were encouraged to\nform communities and to observe certain rituals, although most of\nthese practices, such as the celebration each month of the day (the\n20th) on which Epicurus was born or wearing rings bearing\nan image of Epicurus, may have originated after the founder’s\ndeath. The Epicureans paid attention to problems of pedagogy as well,\nlaying out the best way to correct the ideas of people new to the\nschool and its community without cajoling or discouraging them. It\nmust be remembered that Epicurus understood the task of philosophy\nfirst and foremost as a form of therapy for life, since philosophy\nthat does not heal the soul is no better than medicine that cannot\ncure the body (Usener 1887, frag. 221). A life free of mental anxiety\nand open to the enjoyment of other pleasures was deemed equal to that\nof the gods. Indeed, it is from the gods themselves, via the simulacra\nthat reach us from their abode, that we derive our image of blessed\nhappiness, and prayer for the Epicureans consisted not in petitioning\nfavors but rather in a receptivity to this vision. (Epicurus\nencouraged the practice of the conventional cults.) Although they held\nthe gods to be immortal and indestructible (how this might work in a\nmaterialist universe remains unclear), human pleasure might\nnevertheless equal divine, since pleasure, Epicurus maintained (KD\n19), is not augmented by duration (compare the idea of perfect health,\nwhich is not more perfect for lasting longer); the catastematic\npleasure experienced by a human being completely free of mental\ndistress and with no bodily pain to disturb him or her is at the absolute top\nof the scale. Nor is such pleasure difficult to achieve: it is a mark\nprecisely of those desires that are neither natural nor necessary that\nthey are hard to satisfy. Epicurus was famously content with little,\nsince on such a diet a small delicacy is as good as a feast, in\naddition to which it is easier to achieve self-sufficiency, and\n“the greatest benefit of self-sufficiency is freedom” (VS\n77).","contact.mail":"David_Konstan@brown.edu","contact.domain":"brown.edu"}]
