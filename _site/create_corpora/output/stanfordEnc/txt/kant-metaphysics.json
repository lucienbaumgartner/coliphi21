This\nquestion is often times understood to frame the investigations at\nissue in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. In answer to it,\nKant saw fit to divide the question into three: 1) How are the\nsynthetic a priori propositions of mathematics possible? 2)\nHow are the synthetic a priori propositions of natural\nscience possible? Finally, 3) How are the synthetic a priori\npropositions of metaphysics possible? In systematic fashion, Kant\nresponds to each of these questions. The answer to question one is\nbroadly found in the Transcendental Aesthetic, and the doctrine of the\ntranscendental ideality of space and time. The answer to question two\nis found in the Transcendental Analytic, where Kant seeks to\ndemonstrate the essential role played by the categories in grounding\nthe possibility of knowledge and experience. The answer to question\nthree is found in the Transcendental Dialectic, and it is a\nresoundingly blunt conclusion: the synthetic a priori\npropositions that characterize metaphysics are not really possible at\nall. Metaphysics, that is, is inherently\ndialectical. Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason is thus as well\nknown for what it rejects as for what it defends. Thus, in the\nDialectic, Kant turns his attention to the central disciplines of\ntraditional, rationalist, metaphysics — rational psychology,\nrational cosmology, and rational theology. Kant aims to reveal the\nerrors that plague each of these fields.\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that Kant devotes an entirely new section of the\nCritique to the branches of special metaphysics, his\ncriticisms reiterate some of the claims already defended in both the\nTranscendental Aesthetic and the Transcendental Analytic. Indeed, two\ncentral teachings from these earlier portions of the Critique\n— the transcendental ideality of space and time, and the\ncritical limitation of all application of the concepts of the\nunderstanding to “appearances” — already carry with\nthem Kant’s rejection of “ontology (metaphysica\ngeneralis).”  Accordingly, in the Transcendental\nAnalytic Kant argues against any attempt to acquire knowledge of\n“objects in general” through the formal concepts and\nprinciples of the understanding, taken by themselves alone. In this\nconnection, Kant denies that the principles or rules of either general\nlogic (e.g., the principle of contradiction), or those of his own\n“transcendental logic” (the pure concepts of the\nunderstanding) by themselves yield knowledge of\nobjects. These claims follow from Kant’s well-known “kind\ndistinction” between the understanding and sensibility, together\nwith the view that knowledge requires the cooperation of both\nfaculties. This position, articulated throughout the Analytic, entails\nthat independently of their application to intuitions, the concepts\nand principles of the understanding are mere forms of thought which\ncannot yield knowledge of objects. \n\nWe thus find one general complaint about efforts to acquire\nmetaphysical knowledge: the use of formal concepts and principles, in\nabstraction from the sensible conditions under which objects can be\ngiven, cannot yield knowledge. Hence, the “transcendental”\nuse of the understanding (its use independently of the conditions of\nsensibility) is considered by Kant to be dialectical, to involve\nerroneous applications of concepts in order to acquire knowledge of\nthings independently of sensibility/experience. Throughout the\nAnalytic Kant elaborates on this general view, noting that the\ntranscendental employment of the understanding, which aims towards\nknowledge of things independently of experience (and thus knowledge of\n“noumena”), is illicit (cf. A246/B303). It is in this\nconnection that Kant states, famously, in the Analytic, that\n“…the proud name of ontology, which presumes to offer\nsynthetic a priori cognitions of things in general…\nmust give way to the more modest title of a transcendental\nanalytic” (cf. A247/B304). Filling this out, Kant suggests that\nto take ourselves to have unmediated intellectual access to objects\n(to have “non-sensible” knowledge) correlates with the\nassumption that there are non-sensible objects that we can know. To\nassume this, however, is to conflate “phenomena” (or\nappearances) with “noumena” (or things in themselves). The\nfailure to draw the distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves is the hallmark of all those pernicious systems of thought\nthat stand under the title of “transcendental\nrealism.”  Kant’s transcendental idealism is the remedy for\nthese. \n\nKant’s rejection of the more specialized branches of metaphysics is\ngrounded in part on this earlier claim, to wit, that any attempt to apply\nthe concepts and principles of the understanding independently of the\nconditions of sensibility (i.e., any transcendental use of the\nunderstanding) is illicit. Thus, one of Kant’s main complaints is that\nmetaphysicians seek to deduce a priori synthetic knowledge\nsimply from the unschematized (pure) concepts of the\nunderstanding. The effort to acquire metaphysical knowledge through\nconcepts alone, however, is doomed to fail, according to Kant, because\n(in its simplest formulation) “concepts without intuitions are\nempty” (A52/B76). \n\nAlthough this general charge is certainly a significant part of Kant’s\ncomplaint, the story does not stop there. In turning to the specific\ndisciplines of special metaphysics (those concerning the soul, the\nworld, and God), Kant devotes a considerable amount of time discussing\nthe human interests that nevertheless pull us into the thorny\nquestions and controversies that characterize special\nmetaphysics. These interests are of two types, and include theoretical\ngoals of achieving completeness and systematic unity of knowledge, and\npractical interests in securing the immortality of the soul, freedom,\nand the existence of God. Despite their contributions to metaphysical\nillusion, Kant tells us that the goals and interests in question are\nunavoidable, inevitable, and inherent in the very nature of human\nreason. In the Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic Kant thus\nintroduces “reason” as the locus of these metaphysical\ninterests. \n\nThe emphasis on reason in this connection is important, and it links\nup with the project of Kant’s “critique” of pure reason. A\nmajor component of this critique involves illuminating the basis in\nreason for our efforts to draw erroneous metaphysical conclusions (to\nemploy concepts “transcendentally”), despite the fact that\nsuch use has already been shown (in the Transcendental Analytic) to be\nillicit. What emerges in the Dialectic is a more complex story, one in\nwhich Kant seeks to disclose and critique the “transcendental\nground” that leads to the misapplications of thought which\ncharacterize specific metaphysical arguments. In developing the\nposition that our metaphysical propensities are grounded in the\n“very nature of human reason,” Kant (in the Introduction\nto the Dialectic) relies on a conception of reason as a capacity for\nsyllogistic reasoning. This logical function of reason resides in the\nformal activity of subsuming propositions under ever more general\nprinciples in order to systematize, unify, and “bring to\ncompletion” the knowledge given through the real use of the\nunderstanding (A306/B363-A308/B365). Kant thus characterizes this\nactivity as one which seeks “conditions” for everything\nthat is conditioned. It is therefore central to this Kantian\nconception of reason that it is preoccupied with the\n“unconditioned which would stop the regress of conditions by\nproviding a condition that is not itself conditioned in its\nturn.” \n\nThe demand for the unconditioned is essentially a demand for\nultimate explanation, and links up with the rational prescription to\nsecure systematic unity and completeness of knowledge. Reason, in\nshort, is in the business of ultimately accounting for all things. As\nKant formulates this interest of reason in the first\nCritique, it is characterized by the logical maxim or\nprecept: “Find for the conditioned knowledge given through\nthe understanding the unconditioned whereby its unity is brought to\ncompletion” (A308/B364). It is central to Kant’s Dialectic\nthat this requirement for systematic unity and completeness of\nknowledge is inherent in the very nature of our reason.\nControversially, Kant does not take it that this demand for the\nunconditioned is something we can dismiss, nor does he take the\ninterests we have in metaphysics to be merely products of\nmisguided enthusiasm. \n\nAlthough the demand for the unconditioned is inherent in the very\nnature of our reason, although it is unavoidable and indispensably\nnecessary, Kant nevertheless does not take it to be without problems\nof a unique sort; for the very same demand that guides our rational\nscientific inquiries and defines our (human) reason is also the locus\nof error that needs to be curbed or prevented. In connection with this\nprinciple, then, Kant also identifies reason as the seat of a unique\nkind of error, one that is essentially linked up with metaphysical\npropensities, and one which he refers to as “transcendental\nillusion [transzendentale Illusion].” Kant identifies\ntranscendental illusion with the propensity to “take a\nsubjective necessity of a connection of our concepts…for an\nobjective necessity in the determination of things in\nthemselves” (A297/B354). Very generally, Kant’s claim is that it\nis a peculiar feature of reason that it unavoidably takes its own\nsubjective interests and principles to hold\n“objectively.”  And it is this propensity, this\n“transcendental illusion,” according to Kant, that paves\nthe way for metaphysics. Reason plays this role by generating\nprinciples and interests that incite us to defy the limitations of\nknowledge already detailed in the Transcendental Analytic. The\nIntroduction to the Transcendental Dialectic is therefore interesting\nfor Kant’s presentation of reason as a presumably distinct capacity\nfor cognizing in a way that, as Kant puts it, incites us to tear down\nthe boundaries already enforced in the Analytic (cf.  A296/B352). Kant\nrefers to this capacity of reason as one that leads to the\nspecifically transcendent judgments that characterize\nmetaphysics. Thus, the Transcendental Dialectic is said to be\nconcerned “to expose the illusion in transcendent\njudgments” (A297/B354). Indeed, Dialectic is defined as\n“the logic of illusion [Schein]” \n(A293/B350). \n\nThe central problem is that the above prescription to seek\nthe unconditioned presents to reason as a metaphysical principle that\ntells us that the unconditioned is already given, and is (as\nit were) “there” to be found. This problematic principle\nis formulated by Kant as follows: “If the conditioned is\ngiven, the absolutely unconditioned… is also given”\n(A308/B366). This “supreme principle of pure reason”\nprovides the background assumption under which the metaphysician\nproceeds. These claims set the agenda for Kant’s project, which\ninvolves showing not simply that the metaphysical arguments are\nfallacious, but also exposing their source in reason’s more general illusions. \n\nKant has been traditionally taken to be offering a method of avoiding\nthe insidious “transcendental illusion” that \ngives rise to metaphysics. Read in this way, Kant’s Dialectic offers a\ncriticism not only of the specific arguments of metaphysics, but also\nof transcendent, metaphysical (speculative or theoretical)\ninterests and propensities themselves. This certainly accords\nwith much in the Dialectic, and specifically with Kant’s well-known\nclaim that knowledge has to be limited to possible experience. Kant,\nhowever, complicates things somewhat by also stating repeatedly that\nthe illusion that grounds metaphysics (roughly, that the unconditioned\nis already given) is unavoidable. Moreover, Kant sometimes suggests\nthat such illusion is somehow necessary for our epistemological\nprojects (cf. A645/B673). In this connection, Kant argues that the\ntranscendent ideas and principles of reason do have a positive role to\nplay in knowledge acquisition, so long as they are construed\n“regulatively” and not “constitutively.” He\nthus suggests that rather than jettison the ideas of metaphysical\nobjects (something, it seems, he does not think we are in a position\nto do), it is best to identify the proper use and function of these\nideas and principles. This critical reinterpretation involves the\nclaim that the ideas and principles of reason are to be used\n“regulatively,” as devices for guiding and grounding our\nempirical investigations and the project of knowledge\nacquisition. What the ideas do not do, according to Kant, is provide\nthe concepts through which we might access objects that could be known\nthrough the speculative use of reason. \n\nThe need for this critical reinterpretation stems from the fact that\nreason’s demand for the unconditioned cannot be met or satisfied. The\nabsolutely “unconditioned,” regardless of the fact that it\npresents to reason as objective, is not an object or state of affairs\nthat could be captured in any possible human experience. In\nemphasizing this last point, Kant identifies metaphysics with an\neffort to acquire knowledge of “objects” conceived, but in\nno wise given (or giveable) to us in experience. In its efforts to\nbring knowledge to completion, that is, reason posits certain ideas,\nthe “soul,” the “world” and “God.”\nEach of these ideas represents reason’s efforts to think the\nunconditioned in relation to various sets of objects that are\nexperienced by us as conditioned. \n\nIt is this general theory of reason, as a capacity to think (by means\nof “ideas”) beyond all standards of sense, and as carrying\nwith it a unique and unavoidable demand for the unconditioned, that\nframes the Kantian rejection of metaphysics. At the heart of that\nrejection is the view that although reason is unavoidably motivated to\nseek the unconditioned, its theoretical efforts to achieve it are\ninevitably sterile. The ideas which might secure such unconditioned\nknowledge lack objective reality (refer to no object), and our\nmisguided efforts to acquire ultimate metaphysical knowledge are led\nastray by the illusion which, according to Kant, “unceasingly\nmocks and torments us” (A339/B397). \n\nThe Dialectic is concerned to undermine three distinct branches of\nspecial metaphysics in the philosophical tradition: Rational\nPsychology, Rational Cosmology and Rational Theology. Each of these\ndisciplines seeks to acquire knowledge of a particular metaphysical\n“object” — the “soul,” the\n“world,” and “God,” respectively. This being\nstated, the Dialectic proceeds systematically to undermine the\narguments specific to each of these disciplines—arguments about,\nfor example, the nature of the soul and the world, and the existence\nof God. Despite the difference in their objects, however, there are a\nnumber of problems shared by all the disciplines of special\nmetaphysics. In its most general terms, the central problem with each\nof these attempts has to do with the fact that the alleged\n“objects” under consideration are\n“transcendent.” Although we think the soul, the world, and\nGod (necessarily) as objects, these ideas actually lack\nobjective reality (there is no object corresponding to the ideas that\nis or could be given to us in any intuition). It is thus not uncommon\nto find Kant referring to these alleged metaphysical entities as\n“mere thought entities,” “fictions of the\nbrain,” or “pseudo objects.” Although the Dialectic\ndoes not presume to prove that such objects do not or could not exist,\nKant is committed by the strictures of his own transcendental\nepistemology to the claim that the ideas of reason do not provide us\nwith concepts of “knowable” objects. For this reason\nalone, the efforts of the metaphysicians are presumptuous, and at the\nvery least, an epistemological modesty precludes the knowledge that is\nsought. For more on Kant’s theory of illusion, see Allison (2004), Butts\n(1997), Grier (2001), Neiman (1994), Theis (1985), Bird (2006). See\nalso Ameriks (2006), Dyck (2014). \n\nThere are two noteworthy themes implicit in Kant’s criticism of\nmetaphysics. First, Kant offers an account and critique of the ideas\nof reason specific to each discipline. In relation to this, the\ngeneral theory of reason plays a role in Kant’s efforts to argue\nagainst the “hypostatization” of each of the ideas. More\nspecifically, Kant’s criticism of the metaphysical disciplines centers\non his efforts to show that the ideas of reason (the soul, the world\nand God), which are thought in accordance with the demand for an\nunconditioned that could unify the relevant domain of conditions, get\nerroneously “hypostatized” by reason, or thought as\nmind-independent “objects” about which we might seek\nknowledge. In the same way, that is, that the prescription to seek the\nunconditioned appears to reason as an objective principle, so too, the\nsubjective ideas appear to reason as objects existing in a\nmind-independent way. Kant’s aim is to secure the subjective ideas\nwhile enforcing their subjective status, and thereby defusing the\nmetaphysics that attends to them. \n\nThus, Kant’s criticism of metaphysics simultaneously involves denying\nthe pure use of theoretical reason as an instrument for\nknowledge of transcendent objects, and defending\nreason’s ideas as projections or goals that have some significant role\nto play in the overall project of knowledge acquisition. As we shall\nsee, Kant unfortunately is not as clear as we might like on this\nissue.  Sometimes, he seems to argue that the ideas and principles of\nreason play a merely heuristic role in guiding and systematizing the\nknowledge already obtained. Other times, he suggests that these ideas\nare deeply essential to the project of knowledge acquisition, and that\ntheir presupposition is utterly necessary if we are to acquire\nknowledge.  Regardless of how the matter is to be resolved, it is\nclear that Kant’s criticism of metaphysics does not entail any\nstraightforward rejection of the ideas and principles of\nreason. Indeed, it appears to be precisely the rational constraint to\nmove to the ideas of reason that binds us to our metaphysical\npropensities and which thus demands a critique of the kind offered by\nKant. \n\nIn addition to criticizing the “hypostatization” of the\nideas of reason, Kant seeks to expose the “subreptions”\ninvolved in the use of the ideas. The term “subreption”\nrefers to a fallacy that specifically involves the surreptitious\nsubstitution of different kinds of terms and concepts. Kant\nusually uses the term to refer to the error of confusing or\nsubstituting concepts and principles meant for use in experience\n(those which properly apply to appearances) with principles of\n“pure reason.” By this means, a concept or principle which\nis a condition of our experience (e.g., the principle of apperception)\nis used in a way that assumes its applications to “objects in\ngeneral” or things in themselves. Alternatively, a most general,\nformal, principle that would only hold for things in general is taken,\nby itself alone, to yield knowledge about appearances. This second kind\nof criticism found throughout the Dialectic thus pertains to Kant’s\nefforts to expose the subreptions that ground the illusory metaphysical\narguments. Ultimately, Kant will also seek to reveal the very\nspecific formal fallacies that vitiate the metaphysical arguments, to\ndemonstrate that (although they have the appearance of soundness) the\npositions in each case are implicitly grounded in, or deploy,\ndialectical uses of terms and concepts, misapplications of principles,\nand conflations of appearances with things in themselves. What we find\nin Kant’s criticism of metaphysics, in other words, is a complex\naccount, one grounded in a fairly robust theory of human reason.\nAccordingly, he identifies reason as the locus of certain principles\nand propensities, and certain “illusions,” which cooperate\nwith misapplications of concepts and principles to create the errors\nalready exposed in the Transcendental Analytic. Although this variety\nof aims and complaints certainly complicates Kant’s discussions in the\nDialectic, it also makes for a richer and more penetrating criticism\nof metaphysics. \n\nOne historically predominant metaphysical interest has to do with\nidentifying the nature and the constitution of the soul. Partly for\npractical reasons, partly for theoretical explanation, reason forms\nthe idea of a metaphysically simple being, the soul. Such an idea is\nmotivated by reason’s demand for the unconditioned. Kant puts this\npoint in a number of ways, suggesting that the idea of the soul is one\nto which we are led necessarily insofar as we are constrained by\nreason to seek the “totality” of the “synthesis of\nconditions of a thought in general” (A397), or insofar as we\nseek to represent “the unconditioned unity” of\n“subjective conditions of representations in general”\n(A406/B433). More straightforwardly, Kant states that a metaphysics of\nthe soul is generated by the demand for the “absolute\n(unconditioned) unity of the thinking subject itself”\n(A334/B391). The branch of metaphysics devoted to this topic is\nRational Psychology. Rational psychologists, among whom Descartes or\nLeibniz would serve as apt historical examples, seek to demonstrate,\nfor example, the substantiality, simplicity, and personal identity of\nthe soul. Each such inference, however, involves concluding\n“from the transcendental concept of the subject, which contains\nnothing manifold, the absolute unity of this subject itself, of which\nI possess no concept whatsoever” (A340/B398). In other words,\nKant takes the rational psychologist to slide (mistakenly) from formal\nfeatures of our self concept to material or substantive metaphysical\nclaims about an alleged (super-sensible) object (the soul). \n\nAn essential aspect of all these arguments, according to Kant,is\ntheir attempt to derive conclusions about the nature and constitution\nof the “soul” a priori, simply from an analysis\nof the activity of thinking. A classic example of such an attempt is\nprovided by Descartes, who deduced the substantiality of the self from\nthe proposition (or, perhaps better, the activity) “I\nthink.” This move is apparent in the Cartesian inference from “I\nthink” to the claim that the “I” is therefore “a\nthing” that thinks. For Descartes, this move is unproblematic:\nthought is an attribute, and thus presupposes a substance in which it\ninheres. Kant emphasizes the a priori basis for the\nmetaphysical doctrine of the soul by claiming that in rational\npsychology, the “I think” is supposed to provide the\n“sole text” (A343–4/B401–02). It is this feature of the\ndiscipline that serves to distinguish it from any empirical doctrine\nof the self (any empirical psychology), and which secures its status\nas a “metaphysics” that purports to provide synthetic\na priori knowledge. \n\nKant’s criticisms of rational psychology draw on a number of distinct\nsources, one of which is the Kantian doctrine of apperception, or\ntranscendental self-consciousness (often formulated in terms of the\nnecessary possibility of attaching the “I think” to all my\nrepresentations (B132).  Kant denies that the metaphysician is\nentitled to his substantive conclusions on the grounds that the\nactivity of self-consciousness does not yield any object for thought.\nNevertheless, reason is guided by its projecting and objectifying\npropensities. In accordance with these, self-consciousness is\n“hypostatized,” or objectified. Here again, Kant claims\nthat a “natural illusion” compels us to take the\napperceived unity of consciousness as an intuition of an object\n(A402).  The ineliminably subjective nature of self-consciousness, and\nthe elusiveness of the “I” in the context of that\nactivity, are thus the well known bases for Kant’s response to\nrational psychology, and the doctrine of apperception plays an\nimportant role in Kant’s rejection. For in each case, Kant thinks that\na feature of self-consciousness (the essentially subjectival, unitary\nand identical nature of the “I” of apperception) gets\ntransmuted into a metaphysics of a self (as an object) that is\nostensibly “known” through reason alone to be substantial,\nsimple, identical, etc. This slide from the “I” of\napperception to the constitution of an object (the soul) has received\nconsiderable attention in the secondary literature, and has fueled a\ngreat deal of attention to the Kantian theory of mind and mental\nactivity. \n\nThe claim that the ‘I’ of apperception yields no object of\nknowledge (for it is not itself an object, but only the\n“vehicle” for any representation of objectivity as such)\nis fundamental to Kant’s critique of rational psychology. Kant thus\nspends a considerable amount of time arguing that no object is given\nin transcendental self-consciousness, and thus that the rational\npsychologist’s efforts to discern features of the self, construed as a\nmetaphysical entity, through reason alone are without merit. To\nelucidate the ways in which the rational psychologist is nevertheless\nseduced into making this slide from formal representations of self\nconsciousness to a metaphysics of the self, Kant examines each of the\npsychological arguments, maintaining that all such arguments about the\nsoul are dialectical. He refers to the arguments designed to draw such\nconclusions, “transcendental paralogisms”, and hence the\nchapter of the Critique that criticizes rational psychology goes by\nthe name “The Paralogisms of Pure Reason.” A\ntranscendental paralogism, according to Kant, is a “syllogism in\nwhich one is constrained, by a transcendental ground, to draw a\nformally invalid conclusion” (A341/B399). Kant’s subsequent\nefforts are thus directed towards demonstrating the paralogistic\n(fallacious) nature of the arguments about the soul. \n\nKant’s diagnosis of the fallacies has received considerable attention,\nand has generated considerable controversy. In each case, Kant tells\nus, the argument is guilty of the fallacy of sophisma\nfigurae dictionis, or the fallacy of\nequivocation/ambiguous middle. Kant suggests that in each of the\nsyllogisms, a term is used in different senses in the major and minor\npremises. Consider the first paralogism, the argument that allegedly\ndeduces the substantiality of the soul. In the A edition, Kant\nformulates the argument as follows: \n\nThat the representation of which is the absolute subject of our\njudgments and cannot be employed as determination of any other thing,\nis substance. \n\nI, as thinking being, am the absolute subject of all my possible\njudgments and this representation of myself cannot be employed as\ndetermination of any other thing. \n\nTherefore, I, as thinking being (soul), am substance. (A349) \n\nKant locates the equivocation contained in the argument in the use of\nthe term “substance.” According to Kant, the major premise\nuses this term “transcendentally” whereas the minor\npremise and conclusion use the same term “empirically.”\n(A403). What Kant appears to mean is this: the major premise deploys\nthe term “substance” in a very general way, one which\nabstracts from the conditions of our sensible intuition (space and\ntime). As such, the major premise simply offers the most general\ndefinition of substance, and thus expresses the most general rule in\naccordance with which objects might be able to be thought as\nsubstances. Nevertheless, in order to apply the concept of substance\nin such a way as to determine an object, the category would have to be\nused empirically. Unfortunately, such an empirical use is precluded by\nthe fact that the alleged object to which it is being applied is not\nempirical. Even more problematically, on Kant’s view, there is no\nobject given at all. In Kantian jargon, the category only yields\nknowledge of objects if it is “schematized,” applied to\ngiven objects under the conditions of time. \n\nThis same kind of complaint is lodged against each of the paralogistic\nsyllogisms that characterize Rational Psychology. Thus, Kant argues\nagainst the inference to the simplicity of the soul, by remarking that\nthe psychologist surreptitiously deduces the actual\nsimplicity of a metaphysical object simply from the formal features of\nsubjectivity (the fact that the “I” is unitary in our\nrepresentational economy). The personal identity of the soul is\nattacked on similar grounds. In each case the metaphysical conclusion\nis said to be drawn only by an equivocation in the use or meaning of a\nconcept of the understanding. \n\nThis illustrates Kant’s efforts to demonstrate the fallacious nature\nof the arguments that characterize metaphysics, as well as his\ninterest in identifying the sources of such errors. Given this, Kant’s\ncriticisms of rational psychology are not as straightforward as one\nmight expect, for embedded in his criticisms of rational psychology\nare actually a number of distinct charges: 1) The idea of the soul,\nalthough it is one to which we are naturally led in our quest for the\nunconditioned ground of thought, does not correspond to any object\nthat is (or could be) actually given to us in intuition. The\nhypostatization of this idea, therefore, although it may be natural,\nis deeply problematic. 2) Because the idea of the soul does not yield,\nby itself alone, any knowable object, the arguments about it, although\nthey may have the appearance of being legitimate, in fact involve\ndialectical applications of concepts. The arguments, in other words,\ninvolve fallacies that vitiate their conclusions. 3) The arguments are\ntraceable back to certain features of human reason that may not be\neradicated, but that can and ought to be curbed and critically\nreinterpreted. More specifically, the demand for the unconditioned,\nand the idea of the soul to which it gives rise, may be construed\nregulatively as devices for guiding inquiries, but never constitutively\n— never, that is, as yielding grounds for any a priori synthetic\nknowledge of a metaphysical self given immediately to pure reason. \n\nKant’s Paralogisms have received considerable and focused attention in\nthe secondary literature. See Ameriks (1992), Brook (1994), Kitcher,\nPatricia (1990), Powell (1990), Sellars (1969, 1971), Wolff, R. P.\n(1963). There are also excellent discussions to be found in Allison\n(1983, 2004), Bennett (1974), Buroker (2006), Guyer (1987), Wuerth\n(2010), Bird (2006), Ameriks (2006), Melnick (2006), Dyck (2014),\nProops (2010). \n\nThe second discipline of rationalist metaphysics rejected by Kant is\nRational Cosmology. Rational cosmology is concerned with the arguments\nabout the nature and constitution of the “world,”\nunderstood as the sum-total of all appearances (objects and events in\nspace and time) (A420/B448). The arguments about the world occupy an\nespecially important place in Kant’s rejection of metaphysics. Not\nonly does Kant address himself to the task of discounting the\nmetaphysical arguments in cosmology, but the resolution to some of\nthese conflicts provides, he claims, an indirect argument for his own\ntranscendental idealism. \n\nThe arguments about the world are referred to by Kant as\n“antinomies” because in the field of cosmology, reason\ngives rise to sets of opposing arguments (the “thesis” and\nthe “antithesis”) with respect to each issue. Thus, the\ncase here differs from the paralogisms (and, as we shall see, from the\nIdeal). The reason for this difference resides in the nature of the\nidea of reason in question. The idea of the “world”\npurports to be an idea of an unconditioned but somehow still sensible\nobject (cf. A479/B509). Unlike the soul and God, which are clearly\nsupposed to be non-sensible metaphysical entities, the sum total of\nall appearances refers specifically to spatio-temporal objects or\nevents. Kant highlights this unique feature of the idea of the world\nby noting that whereas the ideas of the soul and God are\n“pseudo-rational,” the idea of the world is\n“pseudo-empirical.” It is precisely this feature of the\nidea (that it both purports to refer to a somehow sensible object AND\nthat it involves thinking that object as already given in its\nunconditioned totality) that leads to the two opposed sets of\narguments. For with respect to each problem addressed (the finitude\nvs. the infinitude of the world, freedom vs. causality, etc.), one can\neither adopt a broadly “dogmatic” (Platonic) or broadly\n“empiricist” (Epicurean) approach, each reflecting a\ndifferent way of thinking the totality of conditions (See\nA471–2/B499–500). More specifically, one can either think\nthe unconditioned as an intelligible ground of appearances, or as the\ntotal (even if infinite) set of all appearances. Unfortunately, each\nof these conceptual strategies is unsatisfying. To accommodate the\nthesis interest in ultimate (intelligible) beginnings is to posit\nsomething “too big” for the understanding, something that\nis never to be met with empirically (e.g., freedom, ultimately simple\nsubstances). Thus, although the thesis positions satisfy reason’s\ndemand for the unconditioned, they do so by fleeing (however\nunwittingly) into an intelligible realm, by providing explanations\nthat abstract from that which is or could be given in any\nspatio-temporal experience. But adopting the empiricist approach is no\nmore rewarding, in the final analysis; although the antithesis\npositions remain securely lodged within “nature’s own\nresources,” they can never measure up to the demands of reason’s\nideas. Such a strategy is “too small” for reason which,\neven despite its capacity to think beyond all standards of sense and\nby its demand for more thorough explanation. Worse, the antithesis\narguments, in refusing to go beyond the spatio-temporal realm, end up\nbeing just as dogmatic as their opposites, for the assumption is that\nwhatever holds within space and time also holds generally. To assume\nthis is to take what are for Kant merely subjective features of our\nintuition (forms of sensibility, space and time) to be universal\nontological conditions holding of everything whatsoever.  \nBecause both sides to the cosmological disputes seem to be able to\nargue successfully against the opposite, Kant finds in the antinomies\na dramatic exhibition of the “conflict” into which reason\ninevitably falls (and in which it will remain) so long as it fails to\nadopt his own transcendental distinction between appearances and\nthings in themselves. The historical debacle of reason’s conflict with\nitself provides Kant with a dramatic exhibition of the vacillation of\nreason between two alternatives, neither of which it can accept (or\ndismiss) without dissatisfaction. Left unresolved, this conflict leads\nto the “euthanasia of pure reason” (A407/B434), in the\nsense of provoking skeptical despair. \n\nThere are four “antinomies” of pure reason, and Kant\ndivides them into two classes. The first two antinomies are dubbed\n“mathematical” antinomies, presumably because in each\ncase, we are concerned with the relation between what are alleged to\nbe sensible objects (either the world itself, or objects in it) and\nspace and time. An important and fundamental aspect of Kant’s\nrejection of each of these sets of arguments rests on his view that\neach of these conflicts is traceable back to a fundamental error, an\nerror that can be discerned, according to Kant, in the following\ndialectical syllogism: \n\nIf the conditioned is given, then the whole series of conditions, a\nseries which is therefore itself absolutely unconditioned, is also\ngiven \n\nObjects of the senses are given as conditioned \n\nConsequently, the entire series of all conditions of objects of the\nsenses is already given. (cf. A497/B525). \n\nThere are a number of problems with this argument, according to\nKant. Obviously, one problem is located in the major premise, in the\nassumption that the unconditioned is “already given.” The\nproblem, maintains Kant, is that such a totality is never to be met\nwith in experience. The rational assumption that the total series of\nall conditions is already given would hold only for things in\nthemselves. In the realm of appearances, the totality is never given\nto us, as finite discursive knowers. The most we are entitled to say,\nwith respect to appearances, is that the unconditioned is set as a\ntask, that there is a rational prescription to continue to seek\nexplanations (A498/B526-A500/B528). As finite (sensible) cognizers,\nhowever, we shall never achieve an absolute completion of\nknowledge. To assume that we can do so is to adopt the theocentric\nmodel of knowledge characteristic of the dreaded transcendental\nrealist. \n\nThis hypostatization of the idea of the world, the fact that it is\ntaken to be a mind-independent object, acts as the underlying\nassumption motivating both parties to the two mathematical antinomies.\nThe first antinomy concerns the finitude or infinitude of the\nspatio-temporal world. The thesis argument seeks to show that the\nworld in space and time is finite, i.e., has a beginning in time and a\nlimit in space. The antithesis counters that it is infinite with\nregard to both space and time. The second antinomy concerns the\nultimate constitution of objects in the world, with the thesis arguing\nfor ultimately simple substances, while the antithesis argues that\nobjects are infinitely divisible. In this, the thesis positions are\neach concerned to bring the explanatory effort to a close, by arguing\nfor ultimate or, as Kant says, “intelligible beginnings”\n(cf.  A466/B494). The claim that there is a “first\nbeginning” or an ultimately simple substance is sustained only\nby abstracting from the spatio-temporal framework. The alleged\nproponent of the antithesis arguments, on the other hand, refuses any\nconclusion that goes beyond the sensible conditions of space and\ntime. According to the antithesis arguments, the world is infinite in\nboth space and time (these being infinite as well), and bodies are (in\naccordance with the infinite divisibility of space) also infinitely\ndivisible. \n\nIn each of these antinomial conflicts, reason finds itself at an\nimpasse. Satisfying the demands placed by our rational capacity to\nthink beyond experience, the thesis arguments offer what appears to be\na satisfying resting-place for explanation. The antithesis charges\nthat such a strategy fails to find any confirmation, and, citing the\nunjustified flight into an intelligible realm, lodges itself squarely\nin the domain of “experience.” In each of these cases, the\nconflicts are resolved by demonstrating that the conclusions drawn on\nboth sides are false. \n\nHow does Kant demonstrate this? Both the thesis and antithesis\narguments are apagogic, i.e., that they constitute indirect proofs. An\nindirect proof establishes its conclusion by showing the impossibility\nof its opposite. Thus, for example, we may want to know, as in the\nfirst antinomy, whether the world is finite or infinite. We can seek\nto show that it is finite by demonstrating the impossibility of its\ninfinitude. Alternatively, we may demonstrate the infinitude of the\nworld by showing that it is impossible that it is finite. This is\nexactly what the thesis and antithesis arguments purport to do,\nrespectively. The same strategy is deployed in the second antinomy,\nwhere the proponent of the thesis position argues for the necessity of\nsome ultimately simple substance by showing the impossibility of\ninfinite divisibility of substance, etc.  Obviously, the success of the proofs depends on the legitimacy of\nthe exclusive disjunction agreed to by both parties. Both parties,\nthat is, assume that “there is a world,” and that it is,\nfor example, “either finite or infinite.” Herein lies the\nproblem, according to Kant. The world is, for Kant, neither finite nor\ninfinite. The opposition between these two alternatives is merely\ndialectical. In the cosmological debates, each party to the dispute\nfalls prey to the ambiguity in the idea of the world.  Kant thus structures his analysis of the mathematical antinomies\nby appealing to the general dialectical syllogism presented at the end\nof section 4.0 (If the conditioned is give, the unconditioned is\ngiven, Objects of the senses are given as\nconditioned....etc.). Problems stem from the application of the\nprinciple expressed in the first premise to the objects of the senses\n(appearances). Here again, Kant diagnoses the error or fallacy\ncontained in this syllogism as that of ambiguous middle. He claims\nthat the major premise uses the term “the conditioned”\ntranscendentally, as a pure concept, whereas the minor premise uses\nthe term ‘empirically’ – that is as a “concept of\nthe understanding applied to mere appearances”\n(cf. A499–500/B527–528). What Kant means is that the major\npremise uses the term “the conditioned” in a very general way, one\nthat considers things in abstraction from the sensible conditions of\nour intuition. The minor premise, however, which specifically refers\nto objects in space and time (appearances), is committed to an\nempirical use of the term. Indeed, such an empirical use would have to\nbe deployed, if the conclusion is to be reached. The conclusion is\nthat the entire series of all conditions of appearances is actually\ngiven. Put in other terms, the conclusion is that there is a world,\nunderstood as the sum total of all appearances and their conditions\n(A420/B448). \n\nIn the dynamical antinomies, Kant changes his strategy somewhat.\nRather than arguing (as in the mathematical antinomies) that both\nconclusions are false, Kant suggests that both sides to the\ndispute might turn out to be correct. This option is available here,\nand not in the two mathematical antinomies, because the proponents of\nthe thesis arguments are not committing themselves solely to claims\nabout spatio-temporal objects. In the third antinomy, the thesis\ncontends that in addition to mechanistic causality, we must posit some\nfirst uncaused causal power (Transcendental Freedom), while the\nantithesis denies anything but mechanistic causality. Here, then, the\ndebate is the standard (though in this case, the specifically\ncosmological) dispute between freedom and determinism. Finally, in the\nfourth antinomy, the requirement for a necessary being is pitted\nagainst its opposite. The thesis position argues for a necessary\nbeing, whereas the antithesis denies that there is any such being. \n\nIn both cases the thesis opts for a position that is abstracted from\nthe spatio-temporal framework, and thus adopts the broadly Platonic\nview. The postulation of freedom amounts to the postulation of a\nnon-temporal cause, a causality outside the series of appearances in\nspace and time (A451/B479). Similarly, in its efforts to argue for a\n“necessary being,” reason is forced (against its own\nargument) into a non-sensible realm. If there is a necessary being, it\nwill have to be “outside” the series of appearances:\n“Either, therefore, reason through its demand for the\nunconditioned must remain in conflict with itself, or this\nunconditioned must be posited outside the series, in the\nintelligible” (A564/B592). The rational necessity of postulating\nsuch a necessary being or a causality of freedom satisfies the\nrational demand for intelligible explanation. Against this, the\nantithesis rightly notes that the conception of transcendental\nfreedom, or a necessary being, again represents an attempt to abstract\nfrom “nature’s own resources” (A451–2/B479–80). Insofar as\nthe antithesis denies the justification for doing this, of course, it\nis said to adopt a broadly Epicurean standpoint. The problem here,\nhowever, is that in refusing to move beyond “nature’s own\nresources,” the antithesis surreptitiously smuggles in\nspatio-temporal conditions as the basis for a universal ontological\nclaim that nevertheless transcends all experience. If space and time\nwere things in themselves, then of course the application of the\ndemand for this unconditioned would be warranted. Kant’s view,\nhowever, is that space and time are not conditions of things in\nthemselves. \n\nThe resolution to these antinomies here consists in giving each side\nits due, but simultaneously limiting the domain over which the claims\nhold. The thesis demand for an absolute causal beginning or a\nnecessary being might well be allowed to stand, but certainly not as\n“part of” or as an explication of appearances in\nnature. Similarly, the antithesis conclusions can stand, but only in\nrelation to objects in nature, considered as appearances. Here, the\nconflict seems irresolvable only on the assumption that appearances\nare things in themselves. If appearances were things in themselves,\nfor example, then it would certainly seem true that either they are\none and all subject to mechanistic causality, or not. In such a case,\nit makes sense both to argue for a non-temporal beginning and to deny\nsuch a beginning.  Left unresolved, then, this antinomy leaves us wit\nthe following dilemma: on the assumption of transcendental realism,\nboth nature and freedom seem to be undermined. To avoid this, Kant\nappeals to transcendental idealism, which is supposed to rescue reason\nfrom the conflict. Given transcendental idealism (with its distinction\nbetween appearances and things in themselves) it remains possible that\nin addition to the mechanism of nature, or contingent existence, there\nis an intelligible causal power, or a necessary being. Detailed discussions of Kant’s antinomies can be found in Al-Azm\n(1972), Bennett, (1974), Grier (2001, 2006), Guyer (1987), Heimsoeth\n(1967), Strawson (1966), Thiel (2006), Watkins (1998, 2000), Van Cleve\n(1984). See also Allison (1983), and Walsh (1975). See also Bird\n(2006), Wood (2010). \n\nThe metaphysical drive, and the demand for the unconditioned, seem to\nfind their natural resting place in the idea of God, an absolutely\nnecessary and supremely real being, the concept of which\n“contains a therefore for every wherefore” (A585/B613). It\nis here, in the concept of God, that the demands for systematic unity\nand completeness of knowledge find their “objective\ncorrelate.” Kant refers to this idea as an Ideal, suggesting it\ndefines itself as a “concept of an individual object which is\ncompletely determined through the mere idea” (A574/B602). The\nIdeal represents the highest singular manifestation of reason’s demand\nfor the unconditioned. \n\nThe last area of metaphysics under attack, then, is Rational\nTheology. Kant’s criticism of rational theology is complicated by his\ndesire to elucidate the sources of the dialectical errors,\nwhich he will expose in relation to the specific arguments for God’s\nexistence. (“…Merely to describe the procedure of our\nreason and its dialectic does not suffice; we must also endeavor to\ndiscover the sources of this dialectic, that we may explain…the\nillusion to which it has given rise” (A581/B607).) Kant thus\nspends a considerable amount of time tracing the idea of God back to\nits rational, speculative, sources. According to Kant,\n“….the Ideal …is based on a natural, not a merely\narbitrary idea” (A581/B607). On this score, Kant wants to tell\nus that we are compelled to think the idea of God (the ens\nrealissimum) when pursuing certain speculative or philosophical\ninterests. More specifically, the idea of a supremely real being (the\nens realissimum) is one to which we are inevitably led during\nour attempts to account for the pure possibility of things in general.\nThe upshot that the idea of the ens realissimum is not an\narbitrary or easily dispensable one. Instead, Kant suggests that\nreason is philosophically constrained to move to such an idea in its\nefforts to thoroughly determine every thing. Such efforts require\nthinking the totality, or “All” of reality (the\nomnitudo realitatis). Such an idea is philosophically\nrequired because, in our efforts to thoroughly determine each thing\n(to know it completely, specify it exhaustively), we must be able to\nsay, of every possible predicate and its contradictory (p v\n˜p) which of the two holds of the thing in\nquestion. (For every object, it is either A or not\nA, either B or not B, etc., and this\nprocess is iterated until each predicate pair (each positive reality)\nis exhausted — Kant clearly has a Leibnizian procedure of\ncomplete determination in mind here.) This process is parasitic upon\nthe idea of “sum total of all predicates of things in\ngeneral.” Or, put in another way, we represent “every\nthing as deriving its own possibility from the share it has in the\nwhole of possibility” (A572/B600). Such an idea, the All of\nreality, however, defines itself as an individual thing, and leads us\nto the representation of the “supremely real being.” The\nproblem seems to come in, according to Kant, when the\n“All” of reality gets hypostatized, and (eventually)\npersonified, thus yielding the ens realissimum (cf.\nA583/B611n). Here again, Kant thinks that this idea itself gets\ntransmuted into the notion of a given object by virtue of a unique\nsubreption, whereby we dialectically substitute for a principle that\nis only meant for empirical employment one which holds of things in\ngeneral. The argument Kant offers is excruciating, but the essential\npoint is that, just as the idea of the soul involved the subreption of\nthe hypostatized consciousness, so too, the idea of the ens\nrealissimum is generated by both a subrepted principle and a\nhypostatization. \n\nAs in the cases of both rational psychology and rational cosmology,\nthen, one central problem thus has to do with the assumption that pure\n(speculative) reason yields any access to a transcendent object (in\nthis case, God) about which it is entitled to seek a priori\nknowledge. Despite his insistence that the idea of God is\nindispensable and “inescapable” (cf. A584/B612), Kant\nagain denies that we can acquire any theoretical knowledge of the\nalleged “object” thought through such an idea. On the one\nhand, then, the idea of God is “the crown of our\nendeavors.” On the other, as in the cases of both rational\npsychology and cosmology, the idea answers to no given and\ntheoretically knowable object (A339/B397). Indeed, according to Kant,\nthe idea of God should not lead us to “presuppose the existence\nof a being that corresponds to this ideal, but only the idea of such a\nbeing, and this only for the purpose of deriving from an unconditioned\ntotality of complete determination the\nconditioned totality. i.e., the limited…” (A578/B606). As in the other disciplines of\nmetaphysics, Kant suggests that we are motivated (perhaps even\nconstrained) to represent the idea as a real object, to hypostatize\nit, in accordance the demand for the unconditioned: \n\nThis demand for the unconditioned, according to Kant, links up with a\ndemand for some ultimately necessary being. Reason, that is,\nceaselessly demands the ground of all the contingent beings in\nexistence, and will not rest until it settles on the absolutely\nnecessary being which grounds them. The idea of the ens\nrealissimum plays a singular role in satisfying this desire of\nreason, for of all concepts, it is that “which best squares with\nthe concept of an unconditionally necessary being” (A586/B614).\nIn fact, according to Kant rational theology is based on the\ncoincidence of the rational demands for a supremely real being and for\na being with absolutely necessary existence. If the movement to the\nidea of God, as the unconditioned ground, is inevitable, it is\nnevertheless as troublesome as the other rational ideas: \n\nThus, although Kant is most well known for his attacks on the specific\narguments for God’s existence, his criticisms of rational theology are\nin fact more detailed, and involve a robust critique of the idea of\nGod itself. This account of the rational origin and the importance of\nthe idea of God clears the way for Kant’s rejection of the\nmetaphysical arguments about God’s existence. Kant identifies three\ntraditional arguments, the ontological, the cosmological, and the\nphysico-theological (the argument from design). What all such\narguments do is attempt to wed the idea of the ens\nrealissimum with the notion of necessary existence. Whereas the\nOntological argument moves from the concept of the ens\nrealissimum to the claim that such a being exists\nnecessarily, the Cosmological and physico-theological arguments move\nfrom some necessary being to the conclusion that such a being\nmust be the ens realissimum. \n\nKant’s formulation of the ontological argument is fairly\nstraightforward, and may be summarized as follows: \n\nKant’s identification of the errors involved in this argument are so\nvaried that it seems surprising that he is so often simply said to\nhave argued against the use of “existence” as a\npredicate. His first complaint is that it is\n“contradictory” insofar as it introduces\n“existence” into the “concept of a thing which we\nprofess to be thinking solely in reference to its possibility”\n(A597/B625). This suggests that he thinks that in taking “all\nreality” to mean or include “existence,” the\nrational theologist begs the question, and already posits the analytic\nconnection between the concept of the ens realissimum and\nnecessary existence. \n\nAt the heart of this complaint is a more general one, to wit, that\nthere is a problem with the attempt to infer anything as\nnecessarily existing. Although, according to Kant, reason is\nunavoidably led to the notion of an absolutely necessary being, the\nunderstanding is in no position to identify any candidate answering to\nthe idea. (cf. A592/B620). Clearly, the ontological argument is\ndesigned to show that, in fact, there is one (and only one)\ncandidate answering to this idea, namely, the ens\nrealissimum.  But it does so by deducing the necessary existence\nfrom the concept of the ens realissimum (a being that\ncontains all reality or predicates) only via the minor premise that\n“existence” is a predicate or reality. Kant, however,\nfamously denies that existence is a “real predicate,” or\ndetermination. Thus, one criticism is that the argument conflates\nmerely logical with real (determining) predicates. A real\n(determining) predicate is one that enlarges the concept to which it\nis attached. It seems clear that the locus of the error here, as in\nthe other metaphysical disciplines, is the view that the idea of the\nens realissimum provides us with a concept of an\n“object” to which it would be appropriate to apply\ncategories or concepts in a determining way. Thus, included in Kant’s\ncriticism is the claim that the category of existence is being subject\nto a transcendental misemployment (A598/B626). This misapplication of\nthe category is problematic precisely because, according to Kant, we\nare dealing only with an object of pure thought, whose existence\ncannot be known (A602/B630). \n\nIf the ontological argument seeks to move from the concept of the\nens realissimum to the concept of an absolutely necessary\nbeing, both the cosmological and physicotheological proofs move in the\nopposite direction. Each, that is, argues that there is something that\nmust exist with absolute necessity and concludes that this being is\nthe ens realissimum. Because these proofs aim to identify the\nens realissimum with the necessary being, and because the\nattempt to do this requires an a priori argument (it cannot\nbe demonstrated empirically), Kant thinks that they are both\n(ultimately) vitiated by their reliance on the ontological\nproof. More specifically, they are both mitigated by their assumption\nthat the ens realissimum is the only object or candidate that\ncan do the job of existing necessarily. Since he thinks that the\nontological argument is in some sense implicitly relied upon in making\nsuch a claim, these arguments stand or fall with it. On Kant’s view,\nas we shall see, they fall. \n\nThe cosmological proof has, according to Kant, two parts.  As\nabove, the proponent of the argument first seeks to demonstrate the\nexistence of an absolutely necessary being. Second, the rational\ncosmologist seeks to show that this absolutely necessary being is the\nens realissimum. \n\nAs Kant formulates it, the cosmological argument is as follows: \n\nIf something exists, then an absolutely necessary being must also\nexist. \n\nI myself, at least, exist. \n\nTherefore an absolutely necessary being exists. \n\nAs above, the theist will ultimately want to identify this necessary\nbeing with the ens realissimum, an identification which Kant\nthinks surreptitiously smuggles in the (dialectical) ontological\nargument. The claim here is that the proponent of the cosmological\nargument is committed ultimately to accepting the ontological\nargument, given her attempt to identify the necessary being with the\nens realissimum. Although this suggests that the cosmological\nargument relies on the ontological, Kant also indicates that the\neffort to produce a purely a priori argument for God’s\nexistence (the ontological argument) itself gets momentum from\nreason’s need to find the necessary ground for existence in general, a\nneed expressed in the cosmological argument\n(cf. A603–04/B631–32). This suggests that Kant takes the ontological\nand cosmological arguments to be complementary expressions of the one\nunderlying rational demand for the unconditioned. \n\nEven aside from its alleged commitment to the ontological argument,\nKant has a number of complaints about the cosmological argument.\nIndeed, according to Kant, the cosmological argument is characterized\nby an “entire nest of dialectical presumptions” which must\nbe illuminated and “destroyed” (A609/B637). These\ndialectical presumptions include the attempt to infer from the\ncontingent (within experience) to some cause lying outside the world\nof sense altogether, an effort involving a transcendental\nmisapplication of the categories. It also includes, Kant claims, the\ndialectical effort to infer from the conceptual impossibility\nof an infinite series of causes to some actual first cause\noutside of sense. Such efforts involve a “false\nself-satisfaction” according to which reason feels itself to\nhave finally landed on a truly necessary being. Unfortunately,\naccording to Kant, this is only achieved by conflating the merely\nlogical possibility of a concept (that it is not\nself-contradictory) with the transcendental (real)\npossibility of a thing. In short, the cosmological argument\ngets its momentum by confusing rational or subjective necessities with\nreal or objective ones, and thus involves transcendental illusion\n(cf. A605/B633). \n\nWe come finally to the physicotheological proof, which argues\nfrom the particular constitution of the world, specifically its\nbeauty, order, and purposiveness, to the necessary existence of an\nintelligent cause (God). Such an argument goes beyond the cosmological\none by moving not from existence in general but from some\ndeterminate experience in order to demonstrate the existence\nof God (A621/B649). Although this might seem to be a strength, this\nstrategy is doomed to fail, according to Kant. No experience could\never be adequate to the idea of a necessary, original being:\n“The transcendental idea of a necessary all-sufficient original\nbeing is so overwhelmingly great, so sublimely high above everything\nempirical, which is at all times conditioned, that partly one can\nnever even procure enough material in experience to fill such a\nconcept, and partly if one searches for the unconditioned among\nconditioned things, then one will seek forever and always in\nvain” (A621/B649). \n\nKant’s claim is that even if we could grant that the order and\npurposiveness of nature gives us good reason to suppose some\nintelligent designer, it does not warrant the inference to an ens\nrealissimum. At most, Kant tells us, the proof could establish a\n“highest architect of the world…., but not a creator of\nthe world.” (A627/B655). The last inference, that to the ens\nrealissimum, is only drawn by moving far away from any\nconsideration of the actual (empirical) world. In other words, here\ntoo, Kant thinks that the rational theologist is relying on a\ntranscendental (a priori) argument. Indeed, according to\nKant, the physicotheological proof could never, given its empirical\nstarting point, establish the existence of a highest being by itself\nalone, and must rely on the ontological argument at crucial stages\n(cf.  A625/B653). Since, according to Kant, the ontological argument\nfails, so does the physicotheological one. \n\nAlthough Kant rejects the physiciotheological argument as a\ntheoretical proof for God’s existence, he also sees in it a powerful\nexpression of reason’s need to recognize in nature purposive unity and\ndesign (cf. A625/B651). In this, the physicotheological argument’s\nemphasis on the purposiveness and systematic unity of nature\nilluminates an assumption that Kant takes to be essential to our\nendeavors in the natural sciences. The essential role played by the\nassumption of purposive and systematic unity, and the role it plays in\nscientific inquiries, is taken up by Kant in the Appendix to the\nTranscendental Dialectic. To this topic we now turn. \n\nFor some discussions of the Ideal of Pure Reason and Rational\nTheology, see Caimi (1995). England (1968), Grier (2001), Henrich\n(1960), Longuenesse (1995, 2005), Rohs (1978), Walsh (1975), and Wood\n(1978), Chignell (2009),Grier (2010), Chignell (2014). \n\nThe criticisms of the metaphysical arguments offered in the\nTranscendental Dialectic do not bring Kant’s discussion to a close.\nIndeed, in an “Appendix” to the Transcendental Dialectic,\nKant returns to the issue of reason’s positive or necessary role. The\ncurious “Appendix” has provoked a great deal of confusion,\nand not without reason. After all, the entire thrust of the Dialectic\nseemed to be directed at “critiquing” and curbing pure\nreason, and undermining its pretense to any real use. Nevertheless,\nKant goes on to suggest that the very reason that led us into\nmetaphysical error is also the source of certain necessary ideas and\nprinciples, and moreover, that these rational postulations play an\nessential role in scientific theorizing (A645/B673;\nA671/B699). Exactly what role they are supposed to play in this regard\nis less clear. \n\nThe Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic is divided into two\nparts. In the first, “On the Regulative Use of the Ideas of Pure\nReason,” Kant attempts to identify some proper\n“immanent” use for reason. In its most general terms, Kant\nis here concerned to establish a necessary role for reason’s principle\nof systematic unity. This principle was first formulated by Kant in\nthe Introduction to the Transcendental Dialectic in two forms, one\nprescriptive, and the other in what sounded to be a metaphysical\nclaim.  In the first, prescriptive form, the principle enjoins us to\n“Find for the conditioned knowledge given through the\nunderstanding the unconditioned whereby its unity is brought to\ncompletion.” The complementary metaphysical principle assures us\nthat the “unconditioned” is indeed given and there to be\nfound. Taken together, these principles express reason’s interests in\nsecuring systematic unity of knowledge and bringing such knowledge to\ncompletion. \n\nKant is quite clear that he takes reason’s demand for systematicity to\nplay an important role in empirical inquiry. In connection with this,\nKant suggests that the coherent operation of the understanding somehow\nrequires reason’s guiding influence, particularly if we are to unify\nthe knowledge given through the real use of the understanding into\nscientific theory (cf. A651–52/B679–80). To order knowledge\nsystematically, for Kant, means to subsume or unify it under fewer and\nfewer principles in light of the idea of one “whole of\nknowledge” so that its parts are exhibited in their necessary\nconnections (cf. 646/B674). The idea of the form of a whole of\nknowledge is thus said to postulate “complete unity in the\nknowledge obtained by the understanding, by which this knowledge is to\nbe not a mere contingent aggregate, but a system connected according\nto necessary laws” (A646/B676). Having said this, it should be\nnoted that Kant’s position is, in its details, difficult to pin down.\nSometimes Kant suggests merely that we ought to seek\nsystematic unity of knowledge, and this merely for own theoretical\nconvenience (A771/B799-A772/B800). Other times, however, he suggests\nthat we must assume that the nature itself conforms to our\ndemands for systematic unity, and this necessarily, if we are to\nsecure even an empirical criterion of truth (cf. A651–53/B679–81). The\nprecise status of the demand for systematicity is therefore somewhat\ncontroversial. \n\nRegardless of these more subtle textual issues Kant remains committed\nto the view that reason’s proper use is always only\n“regulative” and never constitutive. The distinction\nbetween the regulative and the constitutive may be viewed as\ndescribing two different ways in which the claims of reason may be\ninterpreted. A principle of reason is constitutive, according to Kant,\nwhen it is taken to supply a concept of a real object (A306/B363;\nA648/B676).  Throughout the Dialectic Kant argued against this\n(constitutive) interpretation of the ideas and principles of reason,\nclaiming that reason so far transcends possible experience that there\nis nothing in experience that corresponds with its ideas. Although\nKant denies that reason is constitutive he nevertheless, as we have\nseen, insists that it has an “indispensably necessary”\nregulative use. In accordance with reason’s demand, the understanding\nis guided and led to secure systematic unity and completion of\nknowledge. In other words, Kant seeks to show that reason’s demand for\nsystematic unity is related to the project of empirical knowledge\nacquisition. Indeed, Kant links the demand for systematicity up with\nthree other principles — those of homogeneity, specification and\naffinity — which he thinks express the fundamental presumptions\nthat guide us in theory formation. The essential point seems to be\nthat the development and expansion of empirical knowledge is always,\nas it were, “already” guided by the rational interests in\nsecuring unity and completion of knowledge. Without such a guiding\nagenda, and without the assumption that nature conforms to our\nrational demands for securing unity and coherence of knowledge, our\nscientific pursuits would lack orientation.  Thus, the claim that\nreason’s principles play a necessary “regulative” role in\nscience reflects Kant’s critical reinterpretation of the traditional\nrationalist ideal of arriving at complete knowledge. \n\nIt is connection with this that Kant argues, in the second part of the\nAppendix (“On the Final Aim of the Natural Dialectic of Human\nReason” (A669/B697)), that the three highest ideas of reason\nhave an important theoretical function. More specifically, in\nthis section Kant turns from a general discussion of the important\n(regulative) use of the principle of systematicity, to a consideration\nof the three transcendental ideas (the Soul, the World, and God) at\nissue in the Dialectic. As examples of the unifying and guiding role\nof reason’s ideas, Kant had earlier appealed to the ideas of\n“pure earth” and “pure air” in Chemistry, or\nthe idea of a “fundamental power” in psychological\ninvestigations (cf.  A650/B678). His suggestion earlier was that these\nideas are implicit in the practices governing scientific\nclassification, and enjoin us to seek explanatory connections between\ndisparate phenomena. As such, reason’s postulations serve to provide\nan orienting point towards which our explanations strive, and in\naccordance with which our theories progressively achieve systematic\ninterconnection and unity. Similarly, Kant now suggests that each of\nthe three transcendental ideas of reason at issue in the Dialectic\nserves as an imaginary point (focus imaginarius) towards\nwhich our investigations hypothetically converge. More specifically,\nhe suggests that the idea of the soul serves to guide our empirical\ninvestigations in psychology, the idea of the world grounds physics,\nand the idea of God grounds the unification of these two branches of\nnatural science into one unified Science (cf.\nA684/B712-A686/B714). In each of these cases, Kant claims, the idea\nallows us to represent (problematically) the systematic unity towards\nwhich we aspire and which we presuppose in empirical studies. In\naccordance with the idea of God, for example, we “consider every\nconnection in the world according to principles [Principien]\nof a systematic unity, hence as if they had all\narisen from one single all-encompassing being, as supreme and\nall-sufficient cause” (A686/B714). Such a claim, controversial\nas it is, illuminates Kant’s view that empirical inquiries are one and\nall undertaken in light of the rational goal of a single unified body\nof knowledge. It also points towards the Kantian view, later\nemphasized in the Transcendental Doctrine of Method, that reason’s\ntheoretical and practical interests ultimately form a higher\nunity. \n\nFor discussions on the Appendix and the role of reason and\nsystematicity, see Allison (2004), Brandt (1989), Buchdahl (1967),\nBritton (1978), Forster (2000), Friedman (1992), Ginsborg (1990),\nGrier (2001), Guyer (1990a, 1990b), Horstmann (1989), O’Neill (1992),\nPatricia Kitcher (1991), Philip Kitcher (1984), Nieman (1994),\nMacFarland (1970), Walker (1990), Walsh (1975), Wartenberg (1979,\n1992), Rauscher (2010). \n\nFor an important discussion on the “unity” of\ntheoretical and practical reason, see again Forster (2000).
