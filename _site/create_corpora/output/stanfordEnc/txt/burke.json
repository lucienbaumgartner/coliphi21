The present essay\nexplores the character and significance of the use of philosophy in\nhis political thought. That thought is of the very first importance\nfor intellectual history and for the conduct of politics. This essay\nis the first attempt to examine its philosophical character and to\nconnect the latter with Burke's political activity. In doing so it\nshows the importance of the philosophical elements in Burke's thought\nand that these contribute important ways to his political thought.\n\n\n\nThe name of Edmund Burke (1730–97)\n [1]\n is not one that often figures in the history of philosophy\n .[2]\n This is a curious fate for a writer of genius who was also the author\nof a book entitled A Philosophical Enquiry. Besides the\nEnquiry, Burke's writings and some of his speeches contain\nstrongly philosophical elements—philosophical both in our\ncontemporary sense and in the eighteenth century sense, especially\n‘philosophical’ history. These elements play a fundamental\nrole within his work, and help us to understand why Burke is a\npolitical classic. His writings and speeches therefore merit attention\nas examples of attention to both ideas and to history, and of the role\nof this attention in practical thought. His work is also, as we see\nshall see at the end of this entry, an achievement that challenges\nassumptions held by many of our contemporaries. One way or another,\nthen, Burke is a vitally important figure. Yet there is very little\nacademic writing about Burke and philosophy outside of that\nEnquiry. This is a significant omission from the history of\npolitical thought, for at least three reasons. One is that though much\nhas been written about Burke, including work placing him in relation\nto other political writers, yet how he thought has not been made\nclear. A second is that the rational content of his thinking has not\nbeen made evident, precisely because its philosophical component has\nnot been identified. Thirdly, because the manner and content of his\nthought have not been identified in the way the case warrants, we read\nof Burke's ‘mystic spirit’ (Spurgeon 1922, p. 100) or the\n‘irrationalism’ of his writing (Butler 1984, p. 35). This\nmatters not only with respect to historical truth, important though\nthat is, but also because Burke is sometimes treated as a symbolic or\ninstructive figure for contemporary political action (cf., e.g.,\nNorman 2013), and in significant ways marks an instructive contrast\nwith some current ways of thinking. This being so, it is especially\nimportant to get the historical figure right.  \n\nBurke was born at Dublin in Ireland, then part of the British Empire,\nthe son of a prosperous attorney, and, after an early education at\nhome, became a boarder at the school run by Abraham Shackleton, a\nQuaker from Yorkshire, at Ballitore in County Kildare. Burke received\nhis university education at Trinity College, Dublin, a bastion of the\nAnglican Church of Ireland. Thence he proceeded to the Middle Temple\nat London, in order to qualify for the Bar, but legal practice was\nless attractive to him than the broader perspective which had captured\nhis attention at university (or earlier). It was first as a writer,\nand then as a public figure that he made his career. Burke's\nintellectual formation did not suggest that his career would be purely\nphilosophical. Indeed, for those without an independent income or a\nclerical vocation  such a way of life was not very feasible in\nBritain or Ireland. Only the Scottish universities offered posts that\ndid not require holy orders, but they were not very receptive to\nnon-presbyterians. Burke married in 1756, and had a son by 1758, so\nthat a career of Humean celibacy, in which philosophy was cultivated\non a little oatmeal, was not for him. \n\nIndeed, like Hume, Burke found that there was more money in\nnarrative works and in practical affairs than in philosophy. Burke's\nearliest writings include A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin\nof our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757), and A\nVindication of Natural Society (1756). Thereafter he was co-author\nof An Account of the European Settlements (1757) and began\nAn Abridgement of English History (c.1757–62). From 1758, at\nleast until 1765, he was the principal ‘conductor’ of the\nnew Annual Register. In 1765, Burke became private secretary\nto the Marquis of Rockingham (who had just become First Lord of\nthe Treasury) and was elected to the British House of Commons in the\nsame year. He remained there, with a brief intermission in the Autumn\nof 1780, for nearly twenty-nine years, retiring in the Summer of 1794.\nBurke, who was always a prominent figure there and sometimes an\neffective persuader, gave a great many parliamentary speeches. He\npublished versions of some of these, notably on American\nTaxation (1774), Conciliation with America (1775), and\nFox's East India Bill (1783). These printed speeches, though\nanchored to specific occasions, and certainly intended to have a\npractical effect in British politics, were also meant to embody\nBurke's thought in a durable form. In that respect, they parallel\nhis Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents (1770),\nand Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), amongst\nother non-oratorical writings. \n\nBurke's activity as a parliamentarian and political writer embraced a\ngreat many concerns. Prominent amongst these were the problems of\nBritish rule overseas, in North America, India and Ireland. His name,\nhowever, has been linked most strongly by posterity to a critique of\nthe French Revolution. Burke was certainly more notable as a pundit\nthan an executive politician, holding office only twice, for a few\nmonths in 1782 and 1783. His political life was punctuated in May 1791\nby a break from some of his party colleagues over the significance of\nthe Revolution. Thereafter, assisted not least by the turn it took in\n1792–3, he became a largely independent commentator on domestic\npolitics and international affairs in An Appeal from the New to\nthe Old Whigs (1791), Letters on a Regicide Peace\n(1795–7), and A Letter to a Noble Lord (1796). Burke in\nhis last years, especially from 1792, turned his attention to his\nnative Ireland. He failed to found a political dynasty, and he left no\nlasting school in parliamentary politics: the last politician who can\nbe regarded plausibly as a disciple, the addressee of A Letter to\nWilliam Elliot (1795), died in 1818. As Sidgwick observed,\n‘though Burke lives, we meet with no Burkites’ (Sidgwick\n1877 [2000, 195]). Nor did Burke bequeath a straightforward legacy to\nany political party or to any ideological brand of thought, though\nplenty have tried to appropriate him wholly or partly. The\ndifficulties that they might find in colonising his thought are\napparent from an account of it that emphasizes its philosophical\naspects. \n\nBurke's mind, by the time he left Trinity, had two features of especial interest: one was an\norientation towards religion, improvement and politics, the other a\nphilosophical method. The latter derived from his university\neducation, the former from reflection on the Irish situation. Burke\nwas born into an Ireland where reflective intellect had its social\nsetting in a small educational elite, much of it connected with the\nChurch of Ireland. This elite contemplated a political class which\nowned much of the land, and consisted primarily of a gentry and\npeerage, headed by the King's representative, the Lord-Lieutenant; but\nit saw too a tiny professional class, and a huge, illiterate,\nimpoverished peasantry. The aim of the educational elite, which it\nshared with some of the political class, was improvement in the\nbroadest sense, that is to say it connected self-improvement through\nthe influence of the arts & sciences, and through the development\nof intellectual skills, with moral culture and with economic\ndevelopment. The ability of the educated, the politicians and the rich\nto take constructive initiatives contrasted starkly with the inability\nof the peasantry to help itself: peasants relieved their misery\nprincipally through spasms of savagery against their landlords'\nrepresentatives, but such violence was repressed sternly and helped\nnobody. The Irish situation suggested a general rationale of practice\nto those who wished to improve themselves and others: improvement, if\nit was to spread outside the educational elite, must spring from the\nguidance and good will of the possessing classes: from the landlord\nwho developed his property, from the priest who instructed and\nconsoled the poor, and from the lord lieutenant who used his power\nbenevolently. The only obvious alternative was the use of force—and that was\nboth destructive and fruitless. Burke retained all his life a sense of\nthe responsibility of the educated, rich and powerful to improve the\nlot of those whom they directed; a sense that existing arrangements\nwere valuable insofar as they were the necessary preconditions for\nimprovement; and a strong sense of the importance of educated people\nas agents for constructive change, change which he often contrasted\nwith the use of force, whether as method or as result. \n\nThis experiental orientation of Burke's mind was turned from attitude\ninto articulate thought through the educational medium of the Irish\nEnlightenment. For example, some points that may seem distinctively\nBurkean belonged first to Berkeley. Berkeley saw no advantages in\nimproper abstraction or in a mythical golden age. Burke's\nunwillingness to judge institutions and practices without first\nconnecting them with other things, his disinclination ‘to give\npraise or blame to any thing which relates to human actions, and human\nconcerns, on a simple view of the object in all the nakedness and\nsolitude of metaphysical abstraction’ (RRF, W & S\n1981–2015, viii.58), is a practical judgement that implies a\nconceptual counterpart like Berkeley's view that ‘when we\nattempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities, and\nconsider them by themselves, we presently lose sight of them, and run\ninto great extravagancies’ (Berkeley, Principles of Human\nKnowledge [1948–57, vol. ii, 84].) In both cases,\nphilosophical wariness matched a distaste for considering aspects of\nobjects in permanent isolation from the other aspects with which they\nwere essentially connected. This suspicion of abstract ideas\naccompanied a suspicion of schemes for considering people in\nabstraction from their present situation, and accompanied too doubts\nabout a golden past: Berkeley rejected ‘the rude original of\nsociety’ (Berkeley, The Querist [1948–57,\nvol. vi, 141]) and had no time for ‘declaimers against\nprejudice’ who ‘have wrought themselves into a sort of\nesteem for savages, as a virtuous and unprejudiced\npeople’ (Berkeley, Discourse addressed to Magistrates\n[1948–57, vol. vi, 206]), and it need not be emphasized that Burke\nshared such views. Both belonged to an elite which considered\nimprovement to be necessary, and sought to make it through the\nagencies in church, state and education that were really available at\nthe time. Above all, they shared an intellectual temper: they sought\nto see things how they are, with an eye to bettering the condition of\nsociety.  But Burke was not Berkeley, and though their similarities\nindicate a shared philosophical orientation, Burke had his own way of\ndeveloping it. To individuate him, we must turn to what he acquired\nfrom the Trinity syllabus, and how he used his acquisitions. \n\nThis syllabus, by the time Burke became an undergraduate\nstudent at the age of fifteen (1744), not only gave attention to\nAristotelian manuals but also to ‘the way of ideas’\nenshrined in Locke's Essay concerning Human Understanding.\nSuch a syllabus, in its Aristotelian aspect, indicated the unity of all\ndepartments of literature—or learning as we now call it —\nwhich was congenial to one with Burke's passion for knowledge —\nhe wrote of his furor mathematicus, furor logicus,\nfuror historicus, and furor poeticus.\n [3]\n It also indicated the range of achievements, and the range of needs,\nthat people had generated. The extent and variety of human activity\nimpressed itself upon Burke. If his practical situation in Ireland\nsuggested that not reason alone but also Christianity and persuasion\nwere necessary to improvement, Burke could now understand these needs\nin terms of a scheme of learning, and indeed had the opportunity to\ndevelop the corresponding skills. At Trinity he founded a debating\nsociety, where he developed his oratorical technique on theological, moral\nand political topics, as well as commenting on the economic and\nliterary life of Ireland in a periodical run by himself and his\nfriends. This acquisition of skills was complemented by an opportunity for\nphilosophical development. This applied in particular to Burke's\nantecedent bent towards the imaginative branches of literature,\nespecially romances of chivalry, such as the Faerie Queen by\nEdmund Spenser (the collateral ancestor from whom he derived his\nChristian name). Creations of alternative worlds by the mind now\nreceived a philosophical warrant from another part of the Trinity\nsyllabus. Locke had recognized that the mind devised complex\nideas. The mind had a power to receive simple ideas from the senses\nand from its own reflection on them, and to make out of this material\nfurther ideas that had no referent in the world of sensation. Burke's\ninterest did not extend to the centaurs that Locke had mentioned, but\nthe ability to make complex ideas and to assemble them in new ways was\ncentral to Burke's way of proceeding. His philosophical method\ninvolved thinking in terms of complex ideas about a connected range of\nmatters, matters connected by their place in a programme of human\nimprovement. Reason was fundamental to this method—but not\nreason alone, as we see in Burke's sole work devoted wholly to\nphilosophy, which made use of Locke on the way to an original\ndestination. \n\nLocke's Essay concerning Human Understanding of 1690 was\nthe first attempt to give a survey of the mind's workings that was both\ncomprehensive and post-aristotelian. It soon fostered intense interest in\nepistemology, psychology and ethics. Burke seems to have worked on the\nimagination—the faculty of devising and combining ideas —\nas an undergraduate, and continued to do so into the 1750s. The\nresult, A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the\nSublime and Beautiful (1757) emphasized, unsurprisingly, the\nactivity of mind in making ideas and the influence of these upon\nconduct. It was in the first place an exercise in clarifying\nideas, with an eye to refining the ways in which the arts affect the\npassions: in other words, a refinement of complex ideas was taken to be\nthe precondition of a refinement of practice. \n\nThe roots of human activity, Burke thought, were the passions of\ncuriosity, pleasure and pain. Curiosity stimulated the activity of mind\non all matters. Ideas of pain and of pleasure corresponded respectively\nto self-preservation and society, and society involved the passions of\nsympathy, imitation and ambition. Imitation tended to establish habit,\nand ambition to produce change. Sympathy did neither, but it did\nestablish an interest in other people's welfare that extended to mental\nidentification with them. The scope of sympathy could embrace anyone,\nunlike compassion, which applied only to those in a worse situation\nthan oneself. Such width of concern had an obvious reference to the\nsocial order (and may express also Burke's thinking about the theatre).\nThe passions, understood in Burke's way, suggested at once that society as such\nanswered to natural instincts, and that it comprised elements of\ncontinuity and improvement alike. Burke then proceeded to show that\nself-preservation and its cognates suggested the complex idea of the\nsublime, and not least the idea of a God who was both active and\nterrible. Beauty, on the other hand, comprised a very different set of\nsimple ideas, which originated in pleasure. Sublime and beautiful\ntherefore sprang from very different origins. \n\nThe diverse views rejected by A Philosophical Enquiry were\nunited by the pervasive assumption that human nature in an unschooled\ncondition, as it came from the hand of nature, and understood without\ndirect reference to God, was in some sense adequate to the human\ncondition. Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality was at odds\nwith Burke's view of the naturalness of society, and with his view\nthat solitude, because unnatural, was a source of pain, as well as\nwith Burke's position that sympathy, rather than merely compassion,\nwas a key emotion. Burke's view that the mind formed ideas of beauty\nfrom the ideas of pleasure it received contradicted the view of\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson that beauty (like goodness) was a perception\npresented by a sixth or moral sense. Burke's further view that our\nsimple ideas of pain went towards a complex idea of a God who inspired\nterror, was very distant from the deists' view that He could be\nunderstood by our natural faculty of reason alone and that as such He\nwas known to be benevolent and not much besides. These three\npositions alike presumed that human faculties, unimproved by human effort\nand considered with little relation to God, were sufficient to\ninspire conduct. It is not surprising that Burke rejected them. \n\nBurke not only thought that nature needed improvement, but also\nrecognized its ambiguity. Ambition, for instance, was the source of\nenterprise and of improvement: but Burke did not suppose that the\nenterprise produced by this characteristic was in all its \nmanifestations a benefit to its exponent, and\nindeed once called it ‘the cause of the greatest disappointments,\nmiseries and misfortunes, and sometimes of dangerous\nimmoralities’\n [4].\n If Burke had a forward-looking mind, and believed that human nature\nboth required and led to development, he did not think that progress\nwas necessarily an unqualified gain: for instance, in discussing the\ncivilizing of American savages, he saw a diminution of their courage as well\nas an increase in their moral goodness. \n\nA Philosophical Enquiry suggests that Burke was developing\nthe loyalties of his youth through the medium of philosophical\npsychology. A God who presents Himself through nature in a way that is\noften found in the Bible, and who devises and sustains nature in a way\nthat leads man to society and facilitates the improvement of that\nsociety, has set Himself to support Christianity, power and\nimprovement, and probably education too. At the same time, however,\nother aspects of the book suggest that this support was delivered to\nthem, not on their own terms, but on the terms of a philosophy which\nrecognizes the ability of the imagination to transform people's\nunderstandings of themselves and society. \n\nAnyone who thinks in terms of complex ideas can see that these can\nbe framed easily in different ways, none of which need correspond to\nanything found in the external world: combine the ideas of a man and a\nhorse, as Locke had suggested, and you have the idea of a centaur. No one who reads romances\nwould find difficulty in imagining a society differing beyond\nrecognition from its current arrangements. A classic instance of\npolitical imagination, indeed, is Burke's own Vindication of\nNatural Society, which presents as an alternative model of society\nan organization—if that is the word—devoid of civil\ngovernment, church and significant private property. \n\nBurke, in other words, could think through not only his own grouping\nof claims but also their opposites. This reflects, no doubt, other\nfeatures of his mind apart from his understanding of complex ideas,\nsuch as the skill in seeing the strong side and the obverse of any\nargument, which Burke had acquired in his undergraduate study of\nrhetoric; and it reflects, too, a habit of versatility begun in his\ndebating society, for there speakers were called upon to play roles;\nand no doubt it is reminiscent, again, of Burke's undergraduate\ninterest in the theatre. Yet beyond all of these, it suggests that in\nthe large topics which experience had put before Burke—religion,\nmorals, arts and sciences—argument had not produced an\noverwhelmingly decisive case. For A Vindication also seems to\nmake a case against everything he had espoused. \n\nIf argument did not deliver incontestable conclusions, where was one\nto go? Burke's answer, in his notes, was that where this was so,\npeople should prefer the conclusions that accorded with\ntheir natural feelings. The complement to this emphasis upon feeling\nwas to look to the results of affective preference—that is to\nsay, a criterion for conduct in such a case was what tended to make\npeople better and happier. \n\nThis was a judgement in the first place about personal conduct, and\nthe manner of applying it to matters on the larger scale of civil\nsociety was less obvious. Here the judgement of benefit, whether\nethical or pleasurable, might be harder to discern. In order to make it\nplain in A Vindication, Burke applied a reductio ad\nabsurdum to principles in theology that he had rejected by showing\ntheir consequences for politics. \n\nFor that is what A Vindication provided. This short work\nwas written in the persona of the recently deceased Henry St. John,\nViscount Bolingbroke (1678–1751). Bolingbroke had been a Tory pillar of\nthe state, and therefore of the church too; but the posthumous\npublication of his philosophical works revealed that far from being an\nAnglican, he had not been a Christian—but rather a deist. A\nVindication suggested the ills that Bolingbroke had attributed to\nthe artifice of revealed religion could be paralleled by those\ngenerated by civil society. One logic, indeed, was attributable on\nthese terms to both Christianity and civil society: that just as the\nlatter distributed the means of power unequally, so too did\nChristianity distribute those of salvation unequally (for not everyone\nhad heard, and fewer believed, the Gospel). The deism of Bolingbroke\nimplied the principle that God treated everyone impartially, and that\nthe means to salvation were therefore to be found in a medium available\nto all, and thus available from the earliest point of human history,\nnamely reason. It was easy to add, as Burke did, that if the principle\nthat such an original nature was the mature expression of God's\nordinances were to be applied to civil society, the normative result\nwould be a regression from complex and therefore civilised forms to a\nsimple society, even to animal-like primitiveness—some of the\nmatter of A Vindication paraphrases Rousseau's Discourse\non Inequality (Sewell 1938, 97–114). So Bolingbroke the deist and\nBolingbroke the politician could be made to look very much at odds with\neach other. This gap offered Burke an opening. A\nVindication satirized Bolingbroke's schizophrenic position,\nemploying a good deal of transparent exaggeration to make\n‘his’ criticisms of civil (‘artificial’)\nsociety seem very absurd: and Burke added a preface to the second\nedition which made the disjunctive alternatives clear so that even he\nwho ran might read. \n\nYet it is hard not to recognize that Burke himself was telling the\nreader, in a way that entered the consciousness all the more forcibly\nbecause it accompanied entertainment, that civil society really did\ninvolve some evils, just as he identified losses as well as\ngains from progress in other connexions. Burke's Vindication,\nspeaking in the voice of pseudo-Bolingbroke, lamented the situation of\nminers: and ‘the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly,\nunmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations’\nof ‘so many wretches’ was lamented by Burke without any such \npersona, thirty-four years later in Reflections on the Revolution\nin France. Such criticism, taken in itself, is undoubtedly\ntelling. Burke never dissembled the existence of the real misery that\nhe observed in civil society. Instead, he pointed out that wretched\npractices could not be detached from the larger pattern of habits and\ninstitution in which they were implicated, and that this pattern had a\nbeneficial effect overall. Burke recognized misery, did not deny it, and\ntherefore had a lively sense of the imperfection of arrangements,\nhowever civilized they might be. His sense of duality in nature and\nsociety resembles Adam Smith's. \n\nBurke's position, therefore, was poised. But it was not merely a\nmatter of pointing out what made for good and what for ill in civil\nsociety: it was a matter of responsibility—of choosing morally\nappropriate words. This was so for a philosophical reason, because of\nthe very nature of the words involved. Burke's Philosophical\nEnquiry divided words into three categories. First, there were\naggregate words, which signified groups of simple ideas united by\nnature, e.g. man, horse, or tree. Second, there were simple abstract\nwords, each of which stood for one simple idea involved in such\nunities, as red, blue, round or square. Thirdly, and most importantly\nfor our purpose, came abstract compound words. These united aggregate\nwords and simple abstract words. As such, they did not have a referent\nthat existed in nature. A Philosophical Enquiry argued that no\ncompound abstract nouns suggested ideas to the mind at all readily, and\nthat in many cases they did not correspond to any idea at all, but\ninstead produced in the mind only images of past experience connected\nwith these words. This category included virtue, vice, justice, honour,\nand liberty, besides magistrate, docility and persuasion (Wecter 1940,\n167–81). The centrality of such terms to a discussion of civil society\nrequires no emphasis. The obvious inference from Burke's philosophy of\nlanguage was that to use abstract compound words was less to discuss\nideas than to raise images which touched the affections of the listener\nor reader. To do this could scarcely to be thought part of a\nspeculative activity: the effect would not be cognitive, but practical:\nnot to develop ideas, but to influence conduct. The question was, with\nwhat arrangements were these words, and therefore pleasurable images,\nto be connected. \n\nThis understanding of the mind gave speakers and writers an\nunusually powerful role. It was in their hands to connect words which\nsuggested pro-attitudes with arrangements of their choosing:\nfor these words had did not imply only one set of conceptual contents,\nbecause they implied none. If one recollects the propensity to\nimitation that Burke found in mankind, this choosing was likely also to\nbe leading. So Burke was exceptionally sensitive to the role of men of\nletters and public speakers in moulding opinion. By the same measure,\nhe had an unusually lively sense of their responsibilities. It was\nthey who had the power to guide people to the proper ends, or\nelsewhere. Guidance need not be directly didactic—indeed, it\ncould not be, because there could be no definitions to expound —\nbut would be a matter of providing a linguistic context which guided\nlisteners and readers to goals that were ethically and politically\nbeneficial. \n\nOne crucial approach that Burke himself developed was\nhistoriographical. In works of history or in oratory, discussion\ninvolving a compound abstract noun—such as\n‘civilization’ or ‘liberty’— could take place in\nconnexion with aggregate words like ‘Indians’ or ‘the\nEnglish’, and, therefore, being discussed in relation to these,\nconnected that noun with definite ideas rather than with further ideas\nthat had no easily identifiable content—or no content at all.\nAlmost all of Burke's writings and his more important speeches have a\nstrong historical element. That element is cast as a narrative in a way\nthat connects compound abstract words with specific persons and\nspecific transactions. Burke also wrote avowedly historical works in\nthe years immediately after publishing A Philosophical Enquiry\nThe content of these histories developed the preferences of his youth\nfor improvement by embodying these in a way that made them integral to\nthe origins and continuing character of modern arrangements in the\nAmericas and in England. \n\nBurke, like Smith again, wrote ‘philosophical’ history,\nthat is to say gave a view of the key agencies that had shaped human\ndestiny over the long run of human society. Indeed, he casually\nimplied a four-stage theory of socio-economic history at a time when\nScottish stadial history, except that in Dalrymple's Feudal\nProperty (1757), was either unwritten or unpublished. But his\nattention, primarily, lay elsewhere, as appears in An Account of\nthe European Settlements. This work arose from the initiative of\n‘booksellers’ alive to the reading public's interest in\nNorth America, where Britain was then at war with France, and the work\nwas co-written with Burke's ‘cousin’ and friend William\nBurke. Edmund's pen is evident in the passages which contrast savagery\nwith civilization. The book emphasized that the coming of Europeans to\nthe New World brought with it a civilizing of savages, who were far\nfrom noble, through the agency of institutionalised Christianity. This\nimplicit distance from the cult of the noble savage, and from\nprimitivism in general, provided an identifiable complement to the\nimplied rejections of A Philosophical Enquiry and the satire\nabout 'natural society' in A Vindication. \n\nA stage of human history rather later than that of savages was\ndelineated within An Abridgement of English History, which\nBurke wrote after 1757, but did not finish. So far as it goes, this\nprovided a continuous account that ran from the Roman landings to\nMagna Carta. Christianity figured again in this narrative as a source\nof civilization, but the significance of the tale was more\ncomplex. This time the story was primarily political, and showed how\none of the values most prized by Burke's contemporaries, civil\nliberty, came to belong to England. The Norman Conquest of England\nestablished a powerful executive government and brought with it a\nuniform system of law; if these two were necessary conditions for the\nmatching grace of civil liberty for all, however, they were not\nsufficient: the required addition came from an aristocracy, which had\nbeen taught the value of liberty by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and\nwhich had come to understand that its own power was insufficient to\nextract the requisite concessions from the crown unless popular\nsupport could be won. Burke's sense of the double-edged character of\ncivilization thus developed into a sense that the political regime\nrequired by an advanced society—the combination of strong\ninstitutions with civil liberty—came from sources that\nwere contrary to each other, and not always beneficial in isolation\n(aristocracy as a form of government was an ‘austere and\ninsolent domination’ (TCD, W & S, 1981–2015,\nii. 268)): and as both a strong executive and civil liberty were\nneeded, by the same token the forces making for each needed to be\ncounterbalanced from the other side on a continuing basis. This\nbalance of forces characterised a situation in which\n‘liberty’ had an identifiable content, namely the specific\ncivil liberties secured through political struggle and written into\nMagna Carta. \n\nBurke's narratives suggested that agencies antipathetic to each other,\nif properly connected to one another, might produce results that were\nboth intelligible and valuable. One effect amongst several of this\nconception of cooperative conflict was a rehabilitation of the\nRoman Catholicism that was the historic heritage of Burke's family. An\nAccount and An Abridgement alike suggested that in its\nhistorical time and place Roman Catholicism, and, indeed, clericalism,\nwhether embodied in Jesuit missionaries or in an English archbishop,\nhad been a constituent needed to produce social and political benefits\nof a fundamental kind. As an historiographical exemplar, An\nAbridgement therefore showed an exceptional appreciation of the\nMiddle Ages, which was to cause raptures to Lord Acton. It anticipated\nboth Richard Hurd's Letters on Chivalry and Romance (1762),\nand, still more, a great work that set the bearings for Anglo-American\nmedievalists for many years, William Stubbs' Constitutional\nHistory of England (1875–8). Burke, however, could not think in\nterms of an academic historiography, still less one that would be the\nexclusive intellectual preoccupation of its exponents: neither of\nthese existed in his time. He could think, however, of subtly defusing\nanti-Roman prejudice in Georgian Britain. \n\nBurke himself was not a Roman Catholic, and viewed enquiry into his\npersonal background with alarm and suspicion. This was sensible enough\nin a Britain which still subliminally linked civil liberty with\nProtestantism, and therefore regarded Irishness as a likely pointer to\npopish subversion of its political values. Burke's argumentative\nstance always benefited Roman Catholics, but he never found a kind\nword for the Pope: his was a position which emphasized the priority of\ncivil interests over denominational claims in civil society. Indeed\nBurke considered that ‘the truth of our common Christianity, is\nnot so clear as this proposition: that all men, at least the majority\nof men in the society, ought to enjoy the common advantages of\nit.’ (TPL, W & S 1981–2015, ix.464). This was a political\ndevelopment of the centrality he gave to the claims of improvement,\nand of the obvious necessity of its free development for the bettering\nof the human condition. It also silently defused any papal claim to\ncivil dominance on theological grounds and, more audibly, suggested\nthat the penalisation of Roman Catholic beliefs was wrong if these did not\ncause Catholics to interfere with others' civil interests. Burke's\npresumptions about the priority of civil interests and a sense of the\npossible irrelevance of denominational opinion to civil society\nsuggest a reading of Locke's Letter concerning Toleration\nand Two Treatises of Government, the latter of which was\ncommon, though not prescribed reading at Trinity. It also implies that\nthe proper terms in which to conceive civil interests are those of\nnatural jurisprudence, because there people are considered without\nreference to any specific allegiances, religious or otherwise. Burke\nreferred to natural law and natural rights directly when such\nreference advanced his own arguments, though he made no theoretical\ncontribution to natural jurisprudence until quite late in life. His\ncreative energies were mostly applied elsewhere. \n\nBurke developed his thoughts about civil interests in a work that his\nexecutors entitled Tracts on the Popery Laws, which he\ndrafted when he was employed as private secretary to the Chief\nSecretary for Ireland in the early seventeen-sixties. After this,\nBurke became involved more immediately in political practice, and, by\none means or another, contributed to it until his death and (through\nthe activities of his executors in publishing or reprinting his\nwritings) from beyond the grave. This was one obvious route for\npractical development, even besides the amenities of status that it\nbrought to Burke. For his view of the compound abstract words involved\nin civil discussion did not suggest that purely speculative study had\nunlimited potential either for the mind or for personal satisfaction,\nbecause a strictly speculative discussion was likely to be\ninconclusive at best: such words became more readily intelligible in\nconnexion with the concrete, and therefore the practical. Hence,\nperhaps, Burke concluded that ‘man is made for Speculation and\naction; and when he pursues his nature he succeeds best in\nboth.’ (Somerset 1957, 87). There was, on this understanding,\nintellectual benefit in political participation, and, equally,\npolitical practice might benefit from the speculative mind. This is\nlikely to seem an implausible position nowadays, when political\nactivity is frenetic, and learning is a matter of speciality; but in\nthe eighteenth century, when an agile mind could manage at least the\nbasics of several branches of learning, and the British legislature\nwas often in session for less than six months each year, it was more\nplausible. Political participation, on Burke's understanding,\nbesides its intellectual possibilities, had an ethical potential. To the\nextent that thinking about politics was necessarily uncertain, the\nproper conduct of affairs depended upon an honest as well as a\ncapacious mind, and on a well-disposed management of words. \n\nIt remains to show what Burke learnt from political activity, and\nwhat he conferred upon it. The picture is one in which the claims of\npractice enriched Burke's mind and brought intellectual benefits to\npractice itself. \n\nBurke's life was spent in parliamentary affairs from the mid-1760s,\nand this made a difference to his style of intellectual activity. This\ndid not lie primarily in developing the cast of his mind, and if in\n1771 Burke stated that ‘I have endeavoured all my life to train\nmy understanding and my temper in the studies and habits of\nPhilosophy’, at the same time he concluded that ‘my\nPrinciples are all settled and arranged’\n .[5]\n This did not preclude intellectual innovation. The difference made by\nparticipation lay not least in his reasons for applying his mind, and\nconsequently in how he did so. The reasons were to influence opinion,\nboth in Parliament and from his position as a member of the\nlegislative, and to determine votes in the House of Commons itself. The\nmatter common to both of these was Burke's view that words were central\nto political understanding. \n\nAn obvious inference from Burke's account of compound abstract words\nis that to use these is to touch the experience of reader or listener,\nand that persuasion was unavoidably central to discussing politics:\nthis befitted a practical rather than a speculative subject. Indeed,\nthese terms implied that the point of discussing politics must be to\ninfluence action, and nothing much else. Burke developed great skill in\nmanaging words, begun in debating at Trinity and carried forward\nat other venues, including the House of Commons. As such language\nwas persuasive, its objective was to establish pro-attitudes and\ncon-attitudes in mind of listener or reader. \n\nThis was not the only philosophical aspect in Burke's political\npractice. A major conceptual tool in discussing politics was\nrelation. Relation is one of those terms which was common to both the\nscholastics and Locke. It denotes both comparison and connexion.\nComparison was an invaluable procedure because it enabled events,\ninstitutions and persons to be placed in any number of lights which\nwould raise or lower their significance and standing. Connexion was\nscarcely less valuable, because the place that someone or something\noccupied could be used to sustain or criticise their role, as well as\nto demonstrate the value of co-operative contraries. Best of all,\nrelation in either sense lent itself to a myriad of uses, for as\nLeClerc had remarked in his Logic (which Burke had read at\nTrinity) relations were beyond counting—sunt autem\ninnumerae relationes (Le Clerc 1692, pt. 1, ch. 4, s. 1, p.\n19). \n\nBurke's conception of philosophical history was also fundamental to\nhis political practice. ‘Every age has its own manners and its\npoliticks dependent upon them’ (TCD, W & S, 1981–2015, ii 258.) The\nmanners Burke saw around him in England were continuous with those he\nhad seen in the middle ages, or projected backwards thither, in which a\npowerful executive government was balanced by other agencies with the\neffect of securing civil liberty. Those agencies most obvious in\nBurke's time had established the sovereignty of Parliament at the\nGlorious Revolution (1688–9), implied it in the Bill of Rights\n(1689), exercised it in the Act of Settlement (1701), and confirmed it by\nsuppressing the attempts made from 1708 to 1746 to reassert the\nsovereignty of kings alone. Burke understood law in this arrangement as\nthe guarantor of interests of the governed because it was law passed\nand secured by Parliament. It was secured in Parliament by the mutual\ndependence of Commons, Lords and King. That sovereignty had this public\ncharacter made the British state a beneficiary of a very high degree of\nfinancial credit, and this increased the power of Parliament. The long,\nslow movement of British history from a conception of the realm\nunderstood as royal property to the state conceived as the expression\nof public will had in Burke's time reached a stage at which this will\nwas expressed through the decisions of Parliament in a manner heavily\ninfluenced by the monarch. Burke's political activities therefore\nassumed parliamentary sovereignty. \n\nIf Burke's view of words and relations gave him practical\ntools, and if parliamentary sovereignty provided him with a practical\npostulate, what did he assume was the proper end of sovereignty? We\nhave seen that the relation between sovereign and the governed had for\na primary purpose the protection of the latter's civil interests. This\nmuch suggests continuity between Burke the philosopher/historian and\nBurke the political participant. But the former might also see that\nthere were complications for the latter. One who sees the multiplicity\nof civil interests, and the variety of relations in which they can be\nconsidered, and the variety of contraries at work, will see that to put\nsociety at ease with itself may well imply conflict and see that such\nconflict is hard to avoid; he or she will see, too, that Parliament\nforms an arena for conducting it in a stylised and moderated way\nthrough the representation of interests, appropriate to a civilized\nstate of society; and, even while participating in such a conflict,\ns/he might recognizes the necessity of both sides to the result. Here,\nopponents may be not only enemies but also co-workers, sharing at least\nsome common assumptions about the system within which their lot was\ncast, although separated from others by the role required of them. In\nthat situation, the question becomes, where do you take your place? The\nanswer may depend on your own connexions, and on how you\nconceive them. \n\nLet us turn to how Burke's thinking was informed by his philosophical thinking, especially to his use of relation. Burke's method for written composition often combined (i)\nidentification of relations, with (ii) relevant history, and (iii)\ntreatment in language that would attach pro-attitudes to one side or\nthe other in a difference of opinion. This method is seen, for\ninstance, in his Thoughts on the Cause of the Present\nDiscontents (1770). Its central statement for our purpose is\nabout (i) relation in the form of connexion: that the British\nconstitution had been constructed in a manner that required the\nconnexion (in this case the interdependence) of the parts of the\nsovereign in order to achieve mutual control. This statement\ncontrasted with (ii) the historical statement that there was a new\nsystem of court politics which involved disconnecting those parts in\norder to make the monarch independent of the other parts of the\npolitical sovereign. Burke's history showed the emergence of this new\nsystem, and illustrated its pernicious results in both domestic and\nforeign affairs. The contrast (iii) between the older system —\nwhich was represented as having benign results—was clear, and\nthe disposition of pro-language obvious enough. Burke's appeal lay to\nthe standards which his contemporaries would take for granted, namely\nthose implied in their beliefs about parliamentary sovereignty. As if\nit were not enough, the picture of the older order was reinforced by a\nsense of connexion in the Aristotelian sense that Burke's society\nrecognized and approved—that man was sociable, rather than\nbeing a solitary beast, and above all by the annexation of the key\nterm of\nconnexion to the side of the dispute that Burke favoured. All\nof these considerations suggested the appropriateness of ‘the\ngood’ combining to counterbalance the efforts of court\npoliticians, and so to sustain parliamentary sovereignty and its\nbenefits. \n\nThis illustrates Burke's remarkable ability to combine philosophical\nmethod and philosophical history, as well as the practical purpose to\nwhich he put them—forming an understanding of politics which\nwas practical in the very particular sense of calling for activity in\none direction to counterbalance forces coming from another. It was\nalso practical in relation to advancing very specific interests. These\nconsiderations were used to situate quite another sense of connexion,\nnamely political party, and especially the party of Lord Rockingham to\nwhich and to whom Burke had attached himself. Indeed Present\nDiscontents was read in draft by his party's leading lights before\npublication. On publication, the pamphlet was widely understood as a\nmanifesto for this party. After publication Present\nDiscontents became a manual from which fledging politicians\nlearnt the rationale of their party, and, indeed, a source book for\ncat calls from the party colleagues from whom Burke separated\nin 1791. The philosophical and historical element in Burke's positions\nis evident only to those who retrace all of his steps; an activity\nwhich his contemporaries lacked the will, and (as not all of his major\nworks had been published) some of the means to do. \n\nThe educative effect of Burke's writing is not to be underestimated\nin a civil society, which boasted many highly literate members but had very few with any\nformal education in political science (except, sometimes, at\nScottish universities). Indeed, it is likely that Burke wrote in order\nto educate. Yet at the same time that the strength of his conceptual\nand historical arguments, and the skill with which he developed these,\nexcites the reader's admiration, they create unease. This is not merely\nbecause in Present Discontents the philosophical sense of\nconnexion is used to adumbrate the claims of a party connexion: it is a\nmore generalized disquiet. A politician inspires confidence, in part,\nbecause s/he is honest: and a good way to be thought honest is to\nconvey the impression that you are not clever enough to deceive. As a\nphilosopher commands interest when s/he is intellectually powerful,\nthis impression is one that is naturally hard to achieve: but it can be\ndone. C.D. Broad suggested that ‘Locke, we feel, is not so much\ncleverer than ourselves as to be capable of playing tricks with us even\nif he wanted to do so. He is the Mr Baldwin\n [6]\n of philosophy, and he derives from his literary style some of the\nadvantages which that statesman owed to his pipe and his pigs.’\n(Broad 1952, 39). This judgement does not apply to Burke, even though\nhe did keep pigs. The reader carries away from Burke a sense of great\ncreative power, dialectical skill, and verbal ingenuity: in short, a\nsense of being overborne by intellectual force. The listener probably\nreceived other and unwelcome sensations when these were seconded by\npersonal raucousness. Such feelings generate unease, and unease is\nincreased by Burke's prose. \n\nHis literary style is to argue clearly, but in doing so to include a\nmanifest carefulness of qualification that will permit subsequent\nshifts of position—for instance his self-description as a\n‘true but severe friend to monarchy’ is consistent with\nhis occupying any point within the generous spectrum of parliamentary\nsovereignty—and, indeed, the sense of historical change which\npervades Present Discontents suggests that movement is a\ncommon experience. Unease, perhaps, is increased even further: for\nagainst one equipped with this intellectual repertoire, the accusation\nof inconsistency is irresistibly tempting and utterly useless. Again,\nBurke's is a very sensible way for a statesman to think, but it is not\nhow the public wishes politicians to appear on most occasions. Still\nless is it reassuring about Burke's intellectual bona fides:\nfor this is not how people innocent of political experience, who are\nthe majority, conceive the role of political principles. Coleridge put\nhis finger on an important point when he suggested that from\n‘principles exactly the same’ Burke could draw\n‘practical inferences almost opposite’ in different\nsituations (Coleridge, Biographica Literaria, vol. i,\n191). Burke's philosophical and historical positions are clear, but\nthey do not translate, and were not meant to translate, into a set of\nspecific practical conclusions of permanent validity. \n\nThere was the contrast, too, between the breadth of view and of\nlearning in the matured statements that Burke published, on the one\nhand, and, on the other, the ways of the parliamentary pugilist who\nwas audible to fellow M.P.s and legible to others in the speeches\nreported by the daily newspapers. Burke's manner was anything but\n‘philosophical’ as the public understands the word. Partly\nthis was, doubtless, because Burke was like that as a person, and not\nleast because he had a weak voice that had to be raised if it was to\nbe heard in the bear garden that was the House of Commons, but partly,\ntoo, because his Philosophical Enquiry had suggested that the\nbest way to impart a mood to an audience was to display it\noneself. So, for instance, if Burke needed to plead for moderation, he\ndid so immoderately. Above all, perhaps, it was because this\nphilosopher- turned-participant was not exempt from the need to win to\nhis side enough minds to ensure that his side was not beaten (or, at\nany rate, demonstrated enough strength to remain in contention), and\nhad at hand an exceptionally powerful range of persuasive tools. It is\nan evident fact, too, that the resources of Western civilization were\nsometimes invoked by Burke in order to produce votes in the House of\nCommons—votes, which, whatever else they were, were in the\ninterests of his party. But, manifestly, these resources do not supply\na rationale for only one policy, still less for only one party. The\nroles of thinker and party spokesman consort ill: and there were bound\nto be doubts about one \n\nAn apparent disruption of this sort was always likely to suggest that Burke had\nprofoundly personal motives for narrowing his mind, and when he was\nnot being caricatured as an Irish Jesuit he was being satirized as a\ncorrupt hack\n [7].\n Yet some sort of procedure of the type pursued by Burke was implied\nin his sense of practical reasoning. The ‘philosopher in\naction’ had the function of finding ‘proper means’\nto ‘the proper ends of Government’ marked out by\n‘the speculative philosopher’ (TCD, W & S, 1981–2015,\nii. 45–51). Parliamentary votes, in the situation that Burke found\nhimself, were amongst the proper means. \n\nPolitical participation generated scepticism about Burke as a person,\nsome of which was unjust, though all of it was to be expected.  What\nwas perhaps less predictable, and is certainly more interesting\nphilosophically, is that this participation was a precondition of the\npractical thought which made Burke famous in his own time and has\ngiven him a leading place in the canon of Western political\nthought. One very important example of this is his treatment of the\nAmerican Revolution. This was informed, no doubt, by where Burke\nhappened to find himself on the spectrum of practical politics in the\nyears that followed 1766. But his conclusions for practice were\ninformed also by his understanding of ideas – meaning ideas in a\nphilosophical, precisely in a Lockean sense – and how these could be\ncombined. In other words, the content of his political thought was\ninformed importantly not only by where he was practically but also who\nhe was philosophically. \n\nBurke's practical thinking about the dispute between the British\nparliament and its North American colonies began with a situation not\nof his making, that is to say the rejection of the Stamp Act by the\ncolonists, and its withdrawal by the ministry headed by Lord\nRockingham in 1765–6. The Rockingham ministry followed up this\nconcession by way of letting the colonists alone with the explicit\nassertion of Parliament's right to legislate for the colonies in the\nDeclaratory Act of 1766. Burke's task was to demonstrate to the House\nof Commons the plausibility of this package. He did so by combining\ntwo complex ideas—or at least two abstract compound\nnouns—in a new way. One idea was empire, which involved\ncommand. The other was liberty. These, Burke thought, were ideas\ndifficult to combine—a sound reflection as they are\ndiametrically opposed—but that they were combinable in the\nfurther idea of a British empire—one which combined\nlegislative command with civil liberty. This idea implied letting\nalone certain matters of concern to the colonists, and so allowing\nthem in some respects civil liberty on a de facto basis (SDR,\nW & S 1981–2015, ii. 317–18). This idea is\nconsiderably more ingenious than the average British position that\n‘all the dominions of Great Britain are bound by Acts of\nParliament’\n .[8] \n Burke's view was explanatory, because it conceptualised the situation\nbefore Parliament in a way that made intelligible the points involved\nand established a connexion amongst them. It was also accommodating,\nbecause it made the British executive's policy intellectually and\ntherefore practically respectable at the same time that it made room\nfor colonial preferences. In short, it was a small masterpiece of\nthinking about policy. \n\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act was followed by the passing of the\nDeclaratory Act. Burke was practically successful in 1766 with the\nHouse of Commons because he was speaking for the executive, and a\nmajority amongst Members of Parliament, ceteris paribus,\ntended to vote for the king's ministers. In 1774 and 1775 he was\npractically unsuccessful, because he was now in opposition, but his\nconceptual achievement in dealing with the American question became\nmuch greater. By 1774, the issues dividing some American colonists\nfrom Parliament had changed. The former now resented the\nattempts of the latter to levy taxation on them directly, rather than\nby the authority of their own colonial legislatures, and they resented\nstill more the project of backing the attempt, if need be, with\ncoercion. Burke's speech of 1774 on\nAmerican Taxation did not delete the idea of imperial\ncommand, but rather elaborated his complex idea of the British empire\nin a new way in order to deal with the new situation. \n\nBurke elaborated the complex idea in a way to which complex ideas lend\nthemselves, that is to say, by adding a qualification. The sovereignty\nof the British parliament was an idea that certainly included a right\nto tax: but a right to tax could be understood to be consistent on\nprinciple with inaction as well as action. The right, in plainer\nlanguage, need not be applied. Burke could accommodate, therefore,\nboth the claims of Westminster and those of the colonists. To this\npoint, of course, one might reply that Burke was merely\nmaking concessions. But observe: this situation provided a cue for\nconceptual innovation—Burke inserted a distinction into the\nidea of sovereignty. He distinguished ‘my idea of the\nconstitution of the British Empire’ from ‘the constitution\nof Britain’ unconnected with overseas rule. It could be inferred\nthat \n\nso that Burke's elaboration of the complex idea of the British\nempire suggests complementary roles for the British parliament and the\ncolonial legislatures, an elaboration which would make the question of\ntaxation irrelevant at a stroke, whilst simultaneously emphasizing the\nauthority of Westminster. \n\nConceptual refinement provided a practical avenue that other, less\ngifted politicians had not devised. Burke's position was altogether\nsubtler than the implied tautology of a minister's claim that ‘to\nsay we have a right to tax America and are never to exercise that right\nis ridiculous’ (Sir Edward Thurlow, quoted in Gore-Brown 1953,\n85), and of another politician's despairing sense that ‘we must\neither insist upon their submission to the authority of the Legislature\nor give them up entirely to their own discretion.’\n .[9]\n These pundits, by failing to conceive a sufficiently complex idea of\nsovereignty and the sovereign's right to tax, failed also to see that\nsovereignty did not imply an unpleasant choice between abrogating this\nright by disuse or applying it by force. \n\nEvents soon required a further elaboration of Burke's idea of the\nBritish empire. The continued use of coercion made the colonists more,\nnot less recalcitrant. The practical need seemed to be for terms on\nwhich they would stay, in some sense or senses, under British rule. Their\ncrucial claim was now that their right to tax themselves by their own\nlegislatures rested on charters from the Crown, and that they were\nsubordinate to the Crown alone, and not to Parliament. Burke gave still\ncloser attention to the idea of sovereignty. It would be tactless to\nemphasize the sovereignty of Parliament, but it would be self-defeating\nto withdraw it explicitly and concede a sovereign right over taxation\nto the colonial legislatures. So now, in Burke's speech on\nConciliation with America (1775), he focussed upon only one\naspect of the complex idea of a parliamentary sovereign. The latter\ncomprised in the British instance not only Lords and Commons, but also\nthe king. Hence, by judicious emphasis, the item acquiesced in by the\ncolonists could do some conceptual work: ‘my idea of an\nEmpire…is…that an Empire is the aggregate of many States,\nunder one common head; whether this head be a monarch or a presiding\nrepublick’; and it was emphasized that the rights of the colonists\ndepended on this superior, for ‘the claim of a privilege seems\nrather, ex vi termini, to imply a superior power.’ As to\na right to tax, Burke added on a later occasion, that though it\n‘was inherent in the supreme power of society, taken as\nan aggregate, it did not follow that it must reside in any\nparticular power in that society’, and therefore\nParliament could delegate it to local legislatures. In short,\n‘sovereignty was not in its nature an idea of abstract unity; but\nwas capable of great complexity and infinite modifications.’\n(SSC, W & S 1981–2015, iii. 193). \n\nWhether Burke's ‘infinite modifications’ would have\nassisted in keeping the thirteen colonies within the fold of the\nBritish empire is unknowable, for nothing like his proposals were tried\nuntil 1778, which was too late. It is clear, however, that Burke's\nability to make conceptual changes depended on his philosophical\nthinking. To think in terms of complex ideas is to recognize that they\ncan be elaborated by adding further ideas; to distinguish between the\nroles of Parliament is to make that addition; and to analyse the powers\nof a parliamentary sovereign as a preface to relocating one of them is to\nuse philosophy as a tool in practical reasoning. It is noteworthy,\nalso, that these philosophical exercises were the means of coping, as\nBurke hoped, with practical changes. Neither was his work here\nprimarily ideological, for though Burke had a practical goal in view,\nand at that one consistent with the Rockingham achievements of 1766, he\nworked philosophically to modify the conceptions in terms of which his\ncontemporaries viewed their situation, rather than using his conceptual\ntools as ways of defending those conceptions without modifying them.\nThus he added ideas to the stock of his day. It is fitting, though\nBurke's proposals were not implemented in time, and though his goal was\nnot attained, that his American speeches figured prominently in the\nschools and universities of both the U.K. and the U.S.A. well into the\ntwentieth century. Burke, after all, was suspicious of poor ideas: he\nconcluded that ‘one of the main causes of our present\ntroubles’ was ‘general discourses, and vague\nsentiments’, and urged instead study of ‘an exact detail of\nparticulars’ (SSC, W & S 1981–2015, iii. 185). \n\nBurke's thinking about America also suggests a political disposition\nthat owed something to his philosophical conceptions. Burke's complaint\nin American Taxation against ministers was that ‘they\nhave taken things…without any regard to their relations or\ndependencies’, and had ‘no one connected view.’ This\nwas in part a straightforwardly cognitive position on which Burke laid an emphasis with prudential point: the world with which politicians dealt was complex, and to use\nideas which were insufficiently complex to capture its contents and\ntheir relations was a short way to meet the rough side of\nreality. It was also, implicitly an ethical position: governments\nought not to apply force to existing relations, at least those that\nwere legitimate. This is, in one way, an obvious point from natural\njurisprudence, and one that Burke had made transparently with respect\nto inroads by the government of Ireland against Catholic property. In\nanother, and more interesting way, it reflected his view that abstract\ncompound nouns and complex ideas evoke specific past experiences. To\ninterfere forcibly with someone's experientially-based expectations\nwould be to break their mental association between experience and idea\nor word: and so the idea or the word would become meaningless and\ncease to influence action. If, therefore, ‘my hold of the\nColonies, is in the close affection which grows from common\nnames’, amongst other sources that were ‘though light as\nair…as strong as links of iron’, then ‘let the\nColonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with\nyour Government;—they will cling and grapple to you…But\nlet it be once understood, that your Government may be one thing, and\ntheir Privileges another; that these two things may exist without any\nmutual relation; the cement is gone; the cohesion is loosened; and\nevery thing hastens to decay and dissolution.’ (CWA, W & S\n1981–2015, iii. 164). To break such mental associations was to\nbreak communities. \n\nThis point suggested that a genuinely prudent conduct of affairs\nwould proceed without assaulting the mental associations of the\ngoverned, and, as change was omnipresent, would conduct its share under\naccepted names—in other words, by gradual and by moderate\nreform of institutions and practices rather than by immediate and total\nreplacement, which Burke stigmatised as ‘innovation’. This,\nindeed, was what Burke claimed to be doing in his contributions of\n1780–82 to the recasting of the royal household. The intellectual\ncounterpart of this prudent conduct, namely the refinement of our\nexisting ideas, rather than replacing them, is what he had done in his\nrevisions of the idea of sovereignty. \n\nThis style of thinking gave Burke a very lively sense of the corrosive\npower of new ideas. Even new questions could have unpleasant\nresults. When the innovations of the British government unsettled the\ncolonists, ‘then…they questioned all the parts of your\nlegislative power; and by the battery of such questions have shaken\nthe solid structure of this Empire to its deepest foundations.’\nThe proper way to avoid such shakes to civil society was to\n‘consult and follow your experience’ (ATX, W & S\n1981–2015, ii.411, 457), for ‘experience’ according\nto Burke's philosophy of language was a condition of continuity of\nmind, and, on the basis of mind, of a sustainable practice. His was\ntherefore a philosophically conditioned attitude to practice, and one\nthat was very sensitive to the hiatus that speculation could cause in\nthe latter. Burke's sensitivity can produce apodictic language in\norder to persuade people to make use of the ideas they have inherited,\nby urging ‘a total renunciation of every speculation of my own;\nand… [by recommending] a profound reverence for the wisdom of\nour ancestors’ (CWA, W & S 1981–2015,\niii.139). Indeed, Burke can be found, sometimes, on such rational\ngrounds, deprecating all explicit appeal to speculation of whatever\nhue, if it had a disturbing effect: ‘reason not at\nall—oppose the ancient policy and practice of the empire, as a\nrampart against the speculations of innovators on\nboth sides of the question’ (italics added) (ATX,\nW & S 1981–2015, ii.166). His deprecation of speculation was logically\nanterior to taking sides in politics. \n\nIt was also, in effect, an appeal for ideas adequate to governing.\nThis is evident in Burke's criticism of ‘vulgar and mechanical\npoliticians’, \n\nso that ‘little minds’ could not govern ‘a great\nempire’ (CWA, W & S 1981–2015, iii.139), or,\nevidently, any empire at all, whereas better results might be expected\nfrom ‘men truly initiated and rightly taught.’ \n\nBurke himself, however much he might try to set the logic of his\nthought in a rich foliage of words generated by his literary skill\nwith words—he is perhaps the only classic of political thought\nin the English language who is also a literary classic—was a\nphilosophical thinker. As such, his practical conclusions could\nchange, and did, as we have seen. Practical conclusions changed\nbecause they were meant to be serviceable in a world that itself was\nchanging.  Burke's philosophical equipment, however, served him in the\nface of all external changes. The most dramatic of such changes came\nduring the last eight years of his life with the French\nRevolution.  \n\nBurke's name is indissolubly connected to his Reflections on the\nRevolution in France, though a more perceptive account of the\ncauses of the Revolution of 1789 can be found in A Letter to\nWilliam Elliot (1795), and the Letters on a Regicide\nPeace (1795–7) investigate the character and consequences of the\nRevolution from 1791 in a more thoroughgoing way. In an important\nsense, however, the judgement of posterity is right for our purposes,\nbecause Reflections illustrates very clearly the central\nimportance of philosophy and ‘philosophical’ history for\nBurke's writing about one of the greatest changes of his day. \n\nThis is true, in the first place, in terms of insight.\nReflections was published on 1 November 1790, less than\neighteen months after the storming of the Bastille. The intervening\nperiod had been characterised by a mixture of popular violence and\npeaceable, if feverish political activity in France, as its absolute\nmonarchy gave way to a constitutional monarchy. A detached observer\nwould be unsure of the future—whether destruction and violence\nwould predominate or whether an enduring constitutional order would\nemerge was a question which events had not answered. In the event, of\ncourse, the Revolution would be characterised by violence and\nconstitutional development alike at different times, but this was as\nunknowable in 1790 as it is obvious in the twenty-first century. \n\nBurke's Reflections may be divided (for the author did not\nprovide any formal divisions) into two portions of unequal length. Both\nof these are concerned with relations. The first portion, about\ntwo-thirds of the text, suggests that the French, in their enthusiasm\nfor the idea of liberty, had failed to understand that liberty was only\none amongst a range of benefits, all of which were required in\nmutual connexion for a life under civil government that was civilized\nin the proper sense. The results which flowed from this deficiency of\nunderstanding included constitutional arrangements which, because they\ndid not reflect an understanding of liberty that was subtle enough to\ngrasp that the liberty of the many was power, did not qualify popular\nsovereignty in a way that would restrain the demos\neffectively. As if an unrestrained populace was not bad enough, an\nunderstanding of life only in terms of liberty swept away preceding\nelaborations of our ideas. This mattered, because the refinement of\nideas had been a precondition of refinement of conduct and therefore of\nthe progress of society in many respects. One key instance of these was\nthe respectful treatment of women encouraged since the middle ages by\nChristian learning and by chivalry. But there was a newer philosophy:\n‘on this scheme of things, a king is but a man; a queen is but a\nwoman; a woman is but an animal; and an animal not of the highest\norder’. The retrogression of humanity itself to animality was not\nfar in the future with ‘a swinish multitude’. The result,\nas people would no longer be moved by opinion, which had embodied\nrefined ideas, would be that they would need to be governed by force.\nForce, too, was the ultimate destination of the second portion of\nReflections. This suggested that the idea of equality had\nbeen connected only too pervasively with the institutional\narrangements of the judiciary, the legislative and the executive\npower—and therefore had produced not the authority of command\nfrom a s strong government but institutionalised feebleness. At the\nsame time, the perverse results of equality in fiscal arrangements had\ncaused popular discontent and financial instability. The result was a\nsituation which could be controlled only by the force of the\nmilitary—if, indeed, military order was sustainable when\nsoldiers had absorbed the idea of equality. France, it seemed, tended\ntowards either disintegration or the rule of force. \n\nBurke's philosophical repertoire and historical understanding thus\nprovided the structure of Reflections, and, perhaps more\nimportantly, suggested insights into the character of the Revolution.\nThe inattention of the revolutionaries to the relations that needed to\nbe comprised in a modern government, especially in connexion with\nliberty, was matched by the inappropriateness to a sovereign regime of\nstructuring its institutions around equality rather than around\neffective command. These insights suggested that a mis-structuring of\nthe new constitution proceeded from an inadequate philosophical\ngrasp. Such misunderstanding was matched by a failure to understand\nthe historical development which had produced the elaboration of ideas\nabout conduct that had underwritten government by opinion, and this\nfailure suggested that the Revolution would cause retrogression from\nthis civilized condition towards a less gentle way of proceeding, as\nwell as a less effective one. In other words, Burke's understanding of\nphilosophy, and of the history of Europe, conceived\n‘philosophically’, provided grounds for making fundamental\nclaims about the Revolution. \n\nWhether Burke was right in these claims about the Revolution, of\ncourse, is another question, and one that can never be answered:\nFrench readers of Reflections could take its lessons to\nheart, and, anyhow, events have a way of modifying tendencies\nindependently of intention and interpretation. Indeed, none of this is\nto say that Reflections was intended as an academic work, or\neven an accurate factual statement, about the Revolution. It was\ncalculated to produce a practical result, which was to dissuade the\nBritish from admiring the Revolution and so to dampen any propensity\nthey might feel to imitate it: and thus to protect civilization in\nBritain. In the course of pursuing this goal, Burke was willing to\nsatirize the Revolution and its British sympathizers unmercifully in\norder to make them as unattractive as possible to any sane reader, and\nhe matched the satire with a panegyric on British social and political\narrangements.  There is, indeed, much in Reflections besides\nthe elements that have been emphasized here (and indeed much in\nBurke's later views on the Revolution which is not\nin Reflections): but without those elements neither the book nor\nBurke's understanding of the Revolution would have been\npossible. \n\nIt is clear by now that neither ‘mystic spirit’ nor\n‘irrationalism’ characterise Burke helpfully. These\nexamples might be taken as extreme. At the same time they witness\ninterpretative difficulties. Whilst Burke's thought has never lacked\ninterpreters from his own day to ours, on the whole they have not\nbrought to bear the combined persistence of historical insight and\nstrength of conceptual grasp required to do justice to him. Hence he\nhas suffered an ironic fate for one who urged breadth and precision of\nthought. That is to say, he has figured as the spokesman for a very\nlimited number of points or as one preoccupied with a limited number\nof themes. This type of treatment began in the nineteenth century,\nwhen Burke was invoked as an antidote to the confidence of the French\nRevolution by liberal thinkers who prized its principles, saw their\nnarrowness, and required a sense of historical development to situate\nthem properly in a viable civil society. It was continued when Matthew\nArnold tried to treat Burke as a (pre-Home Rule) Gladstonian spokesman\nabout Ireland. It went further still in the twentieth century, when\nBurke was pressed into service as a counter-revolutionary agent in the\nanti-Communist cause, and when the twenty-first dawned some were\ntreating Burke as proponent of postmodernism. He himself could hardly\nhave complained that his work has been put to practical use,\nbut it remains true that academic justice has yet to be done to\nhim. Chapters and essays on individual themes in his writings have\nbeen more plausible on the whole than attempts at general\ninterpretation, which usually concentrate on a theme or themes of\nchoice, or subordinate Burke's thought to it or them, and so give the\nimpression (deliberately or otherwise) that this is the whole of\nBurke, or at any rate that this is what matters about him. One\nresponse to this situation is to concentrate primarily on telling the\nstory, and it is interesting that a number of recent works have taken\nthis path. \n\nIn attacking the Revolution in France, Burke constructed a rogues'\ngallery for French politicians, and stocked it also with quite a\nnumber of French thinkers. The figures who appeared to be rogues,\nhowever, were most of them only straw men, stuffed according to the\nprejudices of a British audience. More significantly for our purposes,\nBurke's censure of the philosophes attributed to them\ncomplicity with the style of thought that had set up a limited range\nof simple principles as the norm for politics, and which was wholly\ninadequate to satisfy the connected and various needs of human nature\nunder modern conditions. Burke preferred to emphasize that numerous\nprinciples, and practical thinking to combine them, were necessary to\nmeet these needs, and so to sustain improvement, and emphasize, too,\nthat such accommodation involved much more practical activity than\nspeculative design. Correspondingly his own writings develop, not a\npolitical philosophy but rather a political style that had at its core\nphilosophical elements—a style which, indeed, implicitly\nsuggested that political philosophy was not feasible as a\nsort of knowledge, and, if it was, certainly not one sufficient to the\ntask of 'the philosopher in action'. The latter, at least as embodied\nby Burke himself, when he mentioned political philosophy, assumed that\nit was highly practical. It for its goal regulating opinion in order\nto produce good political results and to prevent bad ones. “It\nhas ever been the great primary object of speculative and doctrinal\nphilosophy to regulate opinion”, he wrote. “It is the\ngreat object of political philosophy to promote that which is sound,\nand to extirpate what is mischievous, and which directly tends to\nrender men bad citizens in the community, and mischievous neighbours\nout of it” (RP2, W & S ix.295). \n\nSuch a style of thought emphasises the importance of combining a wide range of\nprinciples, and of remembering that principles, however numerous, are only\none element in a satisfactory conduct of practice. There can be no\ndoubt that analysis was involved in Burke's proceedings: “let\nthis position be analysed,” he instructed the House of Commons\ncritically in 1794, “for analysis is the deadly enemy of all\ndeclamation.” [10]\n Though Burke could certainly conduct effective analyses of ideas and\nwords even after more than twenty years at Westminster, as his\nLetter to Sir Hercules Langrishe (1792) demonstrates, his\naccent lay more decidedly upon the necessity of connecting ideas with\neach other, and the inclusion of non-conceptual elements in any\ntreatment of politics that aspired to intellectual and practical\nvalidity. There is nothing in a style of doing philosophy that centres\nupon analysis that is logically inconsistent with these\nprocedures. One temper of mind, however, which sometimes accompanies\nthis manner of philosophising is antipathetic to Burke, whilst there\nis much in contemporary opinions about politics, including those held\nby at least some analytical philosophers, that he would have found\ndangerously naive. Amongst these a belief in a continuing popular\nsovereignty (the modern term of art for this is\n‘democracy’)—rather than parliamentary sovereignty\nis only the most obvious example. If Burke is unlikely at present to\nbe the darling of some philosophers and of some pundits; still less\nwill he be of those who suppose that in discussing a small number of\nprinciples they provide a prescriptive and sufficient guidance for the\nconduct of policy; and even less of anyone who supposes it logically\nadequate to claim that ‘one very simple principle’ is\n‘entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the\nindividual in the way of compulsion and control’ or any other\nmatter (Mill 1859, ‘Introductory’). The complex character\nof ideas, their connexions with each other, the need to understand\npractice in terms of such relations, and to conduct it with attention\nto habitual linkages amongst people's ideas and activities, suggest a\ndifferent sort of thinking. So it is not surprising that Burke has\nbeen quietly ignored by many recent thinkers, or summarily dismissed\nfrom consideration by being labelled as a\n‘conservative’—but it is of great interest that he\nhas found many admirers amongst those who succeed in the conduct of\npractical politics. Whilst Burke would have been the first to point\nout that his specific conclusions belong to a time and a place, his\nintellectual style, is one with which any serious thinking about\npolitics, whether reflective or practical, needs to engage. \n\nBurke's thought is philosophical in at least two senses. One is that\nit is constituted in part by thinking in terms of philosophical\nconceptions, especially complex ideas, particularly those of relation,\nas well as involving significant positions in philosophical psychology\nand the philosophy of language. The other sense is that it develops an\naccount of the American, British and European past which is\nphilosophical history, as the eighteenth-century understood the\nterm. These senses, once put together, inform a style of practical\nthinking about politics which emphasizes the importance of synthetic\nas well as analytical thinking for practice, and suggests that a\nprogressive practice requires not only the yields of past effort but\nalso the intelligent application of mind to their further development\nif progress, rather than regress, is to result. Burke is perhaps the\nleast studied of political classics, but he is certainly amongst the\nsmall number with whom anyone who aspires to have an adequate\npolitical education must engage.","contact.mail":"ich1@leicester.ac.uk","contact.domain":"leicester.ac.uk"}]
