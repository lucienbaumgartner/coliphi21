Among the systems we will review\nare typed theories of sets, Zermelo set theory and its variations, New\nFoundations and related systems, positive set theories, and\nconstructive set theories. An interest in the range of alternative set\ntheories does not presuppose an interest in replacing the dominant set\ntheory with one of the alternatives; acquainting ourselves with\nfoundations of mathematics formulated in terms of an alternative\nsystem can be instructive as showing us what any set theory (including\nthe usual one) is supposed to do for us. The study of alternative set\ntheories can dispel a facile identification of “set\ntheory” with “Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory”; they are\nnot the same thing. \n\nWhy do we do set theory in the first place? The most immediately\nfamiliar objects of mathematics which might seem to be sets are\ngeometric figures: but the view that these are best understood as sets\nof points is a modern view. Classical Greeks, while certainly aware of\nthe formal possibility of viewing geometric figures as sets of points,\nrejected this view because of their insistence on rejecting the actual\ninfinite. Even an early modern thinker like Spinoza could comment that\nit is obvious that a line is not a collection of points (whereas for\nus it may hard to see what else it could be; Ethics, I.15,\nscholium IV, 96). \nCantor’s set theory (which we will not address directly here as\nit was not formalized) arose out of an analysis of complicated\nsubcollections of the real line defined using tools of what we would\nnow call topology (Cantor 1872). A better advertisement for the\nusefulness of set theory for foundations of mathematics (or at least\none easier to understand for the layman) is Dedekind’s\ndefinition of real numbers using “cuts” in the rational\nnumbers (Dedekind 1872) and the definition of the natural numbers as\nsets due to Frege and Russell (Frege 1884).  \nMost of us agree on what the theories of natural numbers, real\nnumbers, and Euclidean space ought to look like (though constructivist\nmathematicians will have differences with classical mathematics even\nhere). There was at least initially less agreement as to what a theory\nof sets ought to look like (or even whether there ought to be a theory\nof sets). The confidence of at least some mathematicians in their\nunderstanding of this subject (or in its coherence as a subject at\nall) was shaken by the discovery of paradoxes in “naive”\nset theory around the beginning of the twentieth century. A number of\nalternative approaches were considered then and later, but a single\ntheory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel theory with the Axiom of Choice\n(ZFC) dominates the field in practice. One of the strengths\nof the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is that it comes with an image of\nwhat the world of set theory is (just as most of us have a common\nnotion of what the natural numbers, the real numbers, and Euclidean\nspace are like): this image is what is called the “cumulative\nhierarchy” of sets. \nIn the nineteenth century, analysis (the theory of the real numbers)\nneeded to be put on a firm logical footing. Dedekind’s\ndefinition of the reals (Dedekind 1872) was a tool for this purpose.\n \nSuppose that the rational numbers are understood (this is of course a\nmajor assumption, but certainly the rationals are more easily\nunderstood than the reals).  \nDedekind proposed that the real numbers could be uniquely correlated\nwith cuts in the rationals, where a cut was determined by a\npair of sets \\((L, R)\\) with the following properties: \\(L\\) and \\(R\\)\nare sets of rationals. \\(L\\) and \\(R\\) are both nonempty and every\nelement of \\(L\\) is less than every element of \\(R\\) (so the two sets\nare disjoint). \\(L\\) has no greatest element. The union of \\(L\\) and\n\\(R\\) contains all rationals. \nIf we understand the theory of the reals prior to the cuts, we can say\nthat each cut is of the form \\(L = (-\\infty , r) \\cap \\mathbf{Q}, R =\n[r, \\infty) \\cap \\mathbf{Q}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) is the set of all\nrationals and \\(r\\) is a unique real number uniquely determining and\nuniquely determined by the cut. It is obvious that each real number\n\\(r\\) uniquely determines a cut in this way (but we need to show that\nthere are no other cuts). Given an arbitrary cut \\((L, R)\\), we\npropose that \\(r\\) will be the least upper bound of \\(L\\). The Least\nUpper Bound Axiom of the usual theory of the reals tells us that \\(L\\)\nhas a least upper bound \\((L\\) is nonempty and any element of \\(R\\)\n(which is also nonempty) is an upper bound of \\(L\\), so \\(L\\) has a\nleast upper bound). Because \\(L\\) has no greatest element, its least\nupper bound \\(r\\) cannot belong to \\(L\\). Any rational number less\nthan \\(r\\) is easily shown to belong to \\(L\\) and any rational number\ngreater than or equal to \\(r\\) is easily shown to belong to \\(R\\), so\nwe see that the cut we chose arbitrarily (and so any cut) is of the\nform \\(L = (-\\infty , r) \\cap \\mathbf{Q}, R = [r, \\infty) \\cap\n\\mathbf{Q}\\). \nA bolder move (given a theory of the rationals but no prior theory of\nthe reals) is to define the real numbers as cuts. Notice that\nthis requires us to have not only a theory of the rational numbers\n(not difficult to develop) but also a theory of sets of rational\nnumbers: if we are to understand a real number to be identified with a\ncut in the rational numbers, where a cut is a pair of sets of rational\nnumbers, we do need to understand what a set of rational numbers is.\nIf we are to demonstrate the existence of particular real numbers, we\nneed to have some idea what sets of rational numbers there are.  \nAn example: when we have defined the rationals, and then defined the\nreals as the collection of Dedekind cuts, how do we define the square\nroot of 2? It is reasonably straightforward to show that \\((\\{x \\in\n\\mathbf{Q} \\mid x \\lt 0 \\vee x^2 \\lt 2\\}, \\{x \\in \\mathbf{Q}\n\\mid x \\gt 0 \\amp x^2 \\ge 2\\})\\) is a cut and (once we define\narithmetic operations) that it is the positive square root of two.\nWhen we formulate this definition, we appear to presuppose that any\nproperty of rational numbers determines a set containing just those\nrational numbers that have that property. \nFrege (1884) and Russell (1903) suggested that the simpler concept\n“natural number” also admits analysis in terms of sets.\nThe simplest application of natural numbers is to count finite sets.\nWe are all familiar with finite collections with 1, 2, 3, …\nelements. Additional sophistication may acquaint us with the empty set\nwith 0 elements. \nNow consider the number 3. It is associated with a particular property\nof finite sets: having three elements. With that property it may be\nargued that we may naturally associate an object, the collection of\nall sets with three elements. It seems reasonable to identify this set\nas the number 3. This definition might seem circular (3 is the set of\nall sets with 3 elements?) but can actually be put on a firm,\nnon-circular footing. \nDefine 0 as the set whose only element is the empty set. Let \\(A\\) be\nany set; define \\(A + 1\\) as the collection of all sets \\(a \\cup\n\\{x\\}\\) where \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(x \\not\\in a\\) (all sets obtained by\nadding a new element to an element of \\(A)\\). Then \\(0 + 1\\) is\nclearly the set we want to understand as \\(1, 1 + 1\\) is the set we\nwant to understand as \\(2, 2 + 1\\) is the set we want to understand as\n3, and so forth. \nWe can go further and define the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of natural\nnumbers. 0 is a natural number and if \\(A\\) is a natural number, so is\n\\(A + 1\\). If a set \\(S\\) contains 0 and is closed under successor, it\nwill contain all natural numbers (this is one form of the principle of\nmathematical induction). Define \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) as the intersection of\nall sets \\(I\\) which contain 0 and contain \\(A + 1\\) whenever \\(A\\) is\nin \\(I\\) and \\(A + 1\\) exists. One might doubt that there is any\ninductive set, but consider the set \\(V\\) of all \\(x\\) such that \\(x =\nx\\) (the universe). There is a formal possibility that \\(V\\) itself is\nfinite, in which case there would be a last natural number \\(\\{V\\}\\);\none usually assumes an Axiom of Infinity to rule out such\npossibilities. \nIn the previous section, we took a completely intuitive approach to\nour applications of set theory. We assumed that the reader would go\nalong with certain ideas of what sets are like. \nWhat are the identity conditions on sets? It seems entirely in accord\nwith common sense to stipulate that a set is precisely determined by\nits elements: two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same if for every\n\\(x\\), either \\(x \\in A\\) and \\(x \\in B\\) or \\(x \\not\\in A\\) and \\(x\n\\not\\in B\\):  \nThis is called the axiom of extensionality. \nIt also seems reasonable to suppose that there are things which are\nnot sets, but which are capable of being members of sets (such objects\nare often called atoms or urelements). These objects\nwill have no elements (like the empty set) but will be distinct from\none another and from the empty set. This suggests the alternative\nweaker axiom of extensionality (perhaps actually closer to common\nsense), \nwith an accompanying axiom of sethood  \nWhat sets are there? The simplest collections are given by enumeration\n(the set {Tom, Dick, Harry} of men I see\nover there, or (more abstractly) the set \\(\\{-2, 2\\}\\) of square roots\nof 4. But even for finite sets it is often more convenient to give a\ndefining property for elements of the set: consider the set of all\ngrandmothers who have a legal address in Boise, Idaho; this is a\nfinite collection but it is inconvenient to list its members. The\ngeneral idea is that for any property \\(P\\), there is a set of all\nobjects with property \\(P\\). This can be formalized as follows: For\nany formula \\(P(x)\\), there is a set \\(A\\) (the variable \\(A\\) should\nnot be free in \\(P(x))\\) such that  \nThis is called the axiom of comprehension. If we have weak\nextensionality and a sethood predicate, we might want to say  \nThe theory with these two axioms of extensionality and comprehension\n(usually without sethood predicates) is called naive set\ntheory. \nIt is clear that comprehension allows the definition of finite sets:\nour set of men {Tom, Dick, Harry} can also\nbe written \\(\\{x \\mid {}\\) \\(x = \\textit{Tom}\\) \\({}\\lor{}\\) \\(x =\n\\textit{Dick}\\) \\({}\\lor{}\\) \\(x = \\textit{Harry}\\}\\). It also appears\nto allow for the definition of infinite sets, such as the set\n\\((\\{x \\in \\mathbf{Q} \\mid x \\lt 0 \\lor x^2 \\lt 2\\}\\) mentioned\nabove in our definition of the square root of 2. \nUnfortunately, naive set theory is inconsistent. Russell gave the most\nconvincing proof of this, although his was not the first paradox to be\ndiscovered: let \\(P(x)\\) be the property \\(x \\not\\in x\\). By the axiom\nof comprehension, there is a set \\(R\\) such that for any \\(x, x \\in\nR\\) iff \\(x \\not\\in x\\). But it follows immediately that \\(R \\in R\\)\niff \\(R \\not\\in R\\), which is a contradiction. \nIt must be noted that our formalization of naive set theory is an\nanachronism. Cantor did not fully formalize his set theory, so it\ncannot be determined whether his system falls afoul of the paradoxes\n(he did not think so, and there are some who agree with him now).\nFrege formalized his system more explicitly, but his system was not\nprecisely a set theory in the modern sense: the most that can be said\nis that his system is inconsistent, for basically the reason given\nhere, and a full account of the differences between Frege’s\nsystem and our “naive set theory” is beside the point\n(though historically certainly interesting).  \nTwo other paradoxes of naive set theory are usually mentioned, the\nparadox of Burali-Forti (1897)—which has historical\nprecedence—and the paradox of Cantor. To review these other\nparadoxes is a convenient way to review as well what the early set\ntheorists were up to, so we will do it. Our formal presentation of\nthese paradoxes is anachronistic; we are interested in their\nmathematical content, but not necessarily in the exact way that they\nwere originally presented. \nCantor in his theory of sets was concerned with defining notions of\ninfinite cardinal number and infinite ordinal number. Consideration of\nthe largest ordinal number gave rise to the Burali-Forti paradox, and\nconsideration of the largest cardinal number gave rise to the Cantor\nparadox. \nInfinite ordinals can be presented in naive set theory as isomorphism\nclasses of well-orderings (a well-ordering is a linear order \\(\\le\\)\nwith the property that any nonempty subset of its domain has a\n\\(\\le\\)-least element). We use reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive\nrelations \\(\\le\\) as our linear orders rather than the associated\nirreflexive, asymmetric, transitive relations \\(\\lt\\), because this\nallows us to distinguish between the ordinal numbers 0 and 1 (Russell\nand Whitehead took the latter approach and were unable to define an\nordinal number 1 in their Principia Mathematica). \nThere is a natural order on ordinal numbers (induced by the fact that\nof any two well-orderings, at least one will be isomorphic to an\ninitial segment of the other) and it is straightforward to show that\nit is a well-ordering. Since it is a well-ordering, it belongs to an\nisomorphism class (an ordinal number!) \\(\\Omega\\). \nIt is also straightforward to show that the order type of the natural\norder on the ordinals restricted to the ordinals less than \\(\\alpha\\)\nis \\(\\alpha\\): the order on \\(\\{0, 1, 2\\}\\) is of order type 3, the\norder on the finite ordinals \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\}\\) is the first\ninfinite ordinal \\(\\omega\\), and so forth. \nBut then the order type of the ordinals \\(\\lt \\Omega\\) is \\(\\Omega\\)\nitself, which means that the order type of all the ordinals\n(including \\(\\Omega)\\) is “greater”—but \\(\\Omega\\)\nwas defined as the order type of all the ordinals and should not be\ngreater than itself! \nThis paradox was presented first (Cantor was aware of it) and Cantor\ndid not think that it invalidated his system. \nCantor defined two sets as having the same cardinal number if there\nwas a bijection between them. This is of course simply common sense in\nthe finite realm; his originality lay in extending it to the infinite\nrealm and refusing to shy from the apparently paradoxical results. In\nthe infinite realm, cardinal and ordinal number are not isomorphic\nnotions as they are in the finite realm: a well-ordering of order type\n\\(\\omega\\) (say, the usual order on the natural numbers) and a\nwell-ordering of order type \\(\\omega + \\omega\\) (say, the order on the\nnatural numbers which puts all odd numbers before all even numbers and\nputs the sets of odd and even numbers in their usual order) represent\ndifferent ordinal numbers but their fields (being the same set!) are\ncertainly of the same size. Such “paradoxes” as the\napparent equinumerousness of the natural numbers and the perfect\nsquares (noted by Galileo) and the one-to-one correspondence between\nthe points on concentric circles of different radii, noted since the\nMiddle Ages, were viewed as matter-of-fact evidence for\nequinumerousness of particular infinite sets by Cantor. \nNovel with Cantor was the demonstration (1872) that there are infinite\nsets of different sizes according to this criterion. Cantor’s\nparadox, for which an original reference is difficult to find, is an\nimmediate corollary of this result. If \\(A\\) is a set, define the\npower set of \\(A\\) as the set of all subsets of \\(A: \\wp(A) =\n\\{B \\mid \\forall x(x \\in B \\rightarrow x \\in A)\\}\\). Cantor proved\nthat there can be no bijection between \\(A\\) and \\(\\wp(A)\\) for any\nset \\(A\\). Suppose that \\(f\\) is a bijection from \\(A\\) to \\(\\wp(A)\\).\nDefine \\(C\\) as \\(\\{a \\in A \\mid a \\not\\in f(a)\\}\\). Because \\(f\\)\nis a bijection there must be \\(c\\) such that \\(f(c) = C\\). Now we\nnotice that \\(c \\in C \\leftrightarrow c \\not\\in f (c) = C\\), which is\na contradiction. \nCantor’s theorem just proved shows that for any set \\(A\\), there\nis a set \\(\\wp(A)\\) which is larger. Cantor’s paradox arises if\nwe try to apply Cantor’s theorem to the set of all sets (or to\nthe universal set, if we suppose (with common sense) that not all\nobjects are sets). If \\(V\\) is the universal set, then \\(\\wp(V)\\), the\npower set of the universal set (the set of all sets) must have larger\ncardinality than \\(V\\). But clearly no set can be larger in\ncardinality than the set which contains everything! \nCantor’s response to both of these paradoxes was telling (and\ncan be formalized in ZFC or in the related systems which\nadmit proper classes, as we will see below). He essentially reinvoked\nthe classical objections to infinite sets on a higher level. Both the\nlargest cardinal and the largest ordinal arise from considering the\nvery largest collections (such as the universe \\(V)\\). Cantor drew a\ndistinction between legitimate mathematical infinities such as the\ncountable infinity of the natural numbers (with its associated\ncardinal number \\(\\aleph_0\\) and many ordinal numbers \\(\\omega ,\n\\omega + 1, \\ldots ,\\omega + \\omega ,\\ldots)\\), the larger infinity of\nthe continuum, and further infinities derived from these, which he\ncalled transfinite, and what he called the Absolute Infinite,\nthe infinity of the collection containing everything and of such\nrelated notions as the largest cardinal and the largest ordinal. In\nthis he followed St. Augustine (De Civitate Dei) who argued\nin late classical times that the infinite collection of natural\nnumbers certainly existed as an actual infinity because God was aware\nof each and every natural number, but because God’s knowledge\nencompassed all the natural numbers their totality was somehow finite\nin His sight. The fact that his defense of set theory against the\nBurali-Forti and Cantor paradoxes was subsequently successfully\nformalized in ZFC and the related class systems leads some to\nbelieve that Cantor’s own set theory was not implicated in the\nparadoxes. \nAn early response to the paradoxes of set theory (by Russell, who\ndiscovered one of them) was the development of type theory (see the\nappendix to Russell’s The Principles of Mathematics\n(1903) or Whitehead & Russell’s Principia\nMathematica (1910–1913). \nThe simplest theory of this kind, which we call TST (Théorie Simple des Types, from the French, following Forster and others) is obtained as follows. We admit\nsorts of object indexed by the natural numbers (this is purely a\ntypographical convenience; no actual reference to natural numbers is\ninvolved). Type 0 is inhabited by “individuals” with no\nspecified structure. Type 1 is inhabited by sets of type 0 objects,\nand in general type \\(n + 1\\) is inhabited by sets of type \\(n\\)\nobjects. \nThe type system is enforced by the grammar of the language. Atomic\nsentences are equations or membership statements, and they are only\nwell-formed if they take one of the forms \\(x^{n} = y^{n}\\) or \\(x^{n}\n\\in y^{n+1}\\). \nThe axioms of extensionality of TST take the form \nthere is a separate axiom for each \\(n\\). \nThe axioms of comprehension of TST take the form (for any\nchoice of a type \\(n\\), a formula \\(\\phi\\), and a variable \\(A^{n+1}\\)\nnot free in \\(\\phi)\\)  \nIt is interesting to observe that the axioms of TST are\nprecisely analogous to those of naive set theory. \nThis is not the original type theory of Russell. Leaving aside\nRussell’s use of “propositional functions” instead\nof classes and relations, the system of Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead & Russell 1910–1913), hereinafter PM\nfails to be a set theory because it has separate types for relations\n(propositional functions of arity \\(\\gt 1)\\). It was not until Norbert\nWiener observed in 1914 that it was possible to define the ordered\npair as a set (his definition of \\(\\lt x, y \\gt\\) was not the current\n\\(\\{\\{x\\},\\{x, y\\}\\}\\), due to Kuratowski (1921), but \\(\\{\\{\\{x\\},\n\\varnothing \\},\\{\\{y\\}\\}\\})\\) that it became clear that it is possible\nto code relation types into set types. Russell frequently said in\nEnglish that relations could be understood as sets of pairs (or longer\ntuples) but he had no implementation of this idea (in fact, he defined\nordered pairs as relations in PM rather than the now usual\nreverse!) For a discussion of the history of this simplified type\ntheory, see Wang 1970. \nFurther, Russell was worried about circularity in definitions of sets\n(which he believed to be the cause of the paradoxes) to the extent\nthat he did not permit a set of a given type to be defined by a\ncondition which involved quantification over the same type or a higher\ntype. This predicativity restriction weakens the mathematical\npower of set theory to an extreme degree. \nIn Russell’s system, the restriction is implemented by\ncharacterizing a type not only by the type of its elements but by an\nadditional integer parameter called its “order”. For any\nobject with elements, the order of its type is higher than the order\nof the type of its elements. Further, the comprehension axiom is\nrestricted so that the condition defining a set of a type of order\n\\(n\\) can contain parameters only of types with order \\(\\le n\\) and\nquantifiers only over types with order \\(\\lt n\\). Russell’s\nsystem is further complicated by the fact that it is not a theory of\nsets, as we noted above, because it also contains relation types (this\nmakes a full account of it here inappropriate). Even if we restrict to\ntypes of sets, a simple linear hierarchy of types is not possible if\ntypes have order, because each type has “power set” types\nof each order higher than its own. \nWe present a typed theory of sets with predicativity restrictions (we\nhave seen this in work of Marcel Crabbé, but it may be older).\nIn this system, the types do not have orders, but Russell’s\nramified type theory with orders (complete with relation types) can be\ninterpreted in it (a technical result of which we do not give an\naccount here). \nThe syntax of predicative TST is the same as that of the\noriginal system. The axioms of extensionality are also the same. The\naxioms of comprehension of predicative TST take the form (for\nany choice of a type \\(n\\), a formula \\(\\phi\\), and a variable\n\\(A^{n+1}\\) not free in \\(\\phi\\), satisfying the restriction that no\nparameter of type \\(n + 2\\) or greater appears in \\(\\phi\\), nor does\nany quantifier over type \\(n + 1\\) or higher appear in \\(\\phi)\\) \nPredicative mathematics does not permit unrestricted mathematical\ninduction: In impredicative type theory, we can define 0 and the\n“successor” \\(A^+\\) of a set just as we did above in naive\nset theory (in a given type \\(n)\\) then define the set of natural\nnumbers: \nRussell would object that the set \\(\\mathbf{N}^{n+1}\\) is being\n“defined” in terms of facts about all sets\n\\(A^{n+1}\\): something is a type \\(n + 1\\) natural number just in case\nit belongs to all type \\(n + 1\\) inductive sets. But one of the type\n\\(n + 1\\) sets in terms of which it is being “defined” is\n\\(\\mathbf{N}^{n+1}\\) itself. (Independently of predicativist scruples,\none does need an Axiom of Infinity to ensure that all natural numbers\nexist; this is frequently added to TST, as is the Axiom of\nChoice). \nFor similar reasons, predicative mathematics does not permit the Least\nUpper Bound Axiom of analysis (the proof of this axiom in a set\ntheoretical implementation of the reals as Dedekind cuts fails for the\nsame kind of reason). \nRussell solved these problems in PM by adopting an Axiom of\nReducibility which in effect eliminated the predicativity\nrestrictions, but in later comments on PM he advocated\nabandoning this axiom. \nMost mathematicians are not predicativists; in our opinion the best\nanswer to predicativist objections is to deny that comprehension\naxioms can properly be construed as definitions (though we admit that\nwe seem to find ourselves frequently speaking loosely of \\(\\phi\\) as\nthe condition which “defines” \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi\n\\})\\). \nIt should be noted that it is possible to do a significant amount of\nmathematics while obeying predicativist scruples. The set of natural\nnumbers cannot be defined in the predicative version of TST,\nbut the set of singletons of natural numbers can be defined and can be\nused to prove some instances of induction (enough to do quite a bit of\nelementary mathematics). Similarly, a version of the Dedekind\nconstruction of the real numbers can be carried out, in which many\nimportant instances of the least upper bound axiom will be\nprovable. \nType theories are still in use, mostly in theoretical computer\nscience, but these are type theories of functions, with\ncomplexity similar to or greater than the complexity of the system of\nPM, and fortunately outside the scope of this study. \nIn this section we discuss the development of the usual set theory\nZFC. It did not spring up full-grown like Athena from the\nhead of Zeus! \nThe original theory Z of Zermelo (1908) had the following\naxioms: \nExtensionality: Sets with the same elements are\nequal. (The original version appears to permit non-sets (atoms) which\nall have no elements, much as in my discussion above under naive set\ntheory). \nPairing: For any objects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there is a\nset \\(\\{a, b\\} = \\{x \\mid x = a \\lor x = b\\}\\). (the original\naxiom also provided the empty set and singleton sets). \nUnion: For any set \\(A\\), there is a set \\(\\cup A =\n\\{x \\mid \\exists y(x \\in y \\amp y \\in A)\\}\\). The union of \\(A\\)\ncontains all the elements of elements of \\(A\\). \nPower Set: For any set \\(A\\), there is a set \\(\\wp(A)\n= \\{x \\mid \\forall y(y \\in x \\rightarrow y \\in A)\\}\\). The power\nset of \\(A\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(A\\). \nInfinity: There is an infinite set. Zermelo’s\noriginal formulation asserted the existence of a set containing\n\\(\\varnothing\\) and closed under the singleton operation:\n\\(\\{\\varnothing ,\\{\\varnothing \\},\\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}, \\ldots \\}\\).\nIt is now more usual to assert the existence of a set which contains\n\\(\\varnothing\\) and is closed under the von Neumann successor\noperation \\(x \\mapsto x \\cup \\{x\\}\\). (Neither of these axioms implies\nthe other in the presence of the other axioms, though they yield\ntheories with the same mathematical strength). \nSeparation: For any property \\(P(x)\\) of objects and\nany set \\(A\\), there is a set \\(\\{x \\in A \\mid P(x)\\}\\) which\ncontains all the elements of \\(A\\) with the property \\(P\\). \nChoice: For every set \\(C\\) of pairwise disjoint\nnonempty sets, there is a set whose intersection with each element of\n\\(C\\) has exactly one element. \nWe note that we do not need an axiom asserting the existence of\n\\(\\varnothing\\) (which is frequently included in axiom lists as it was\nin Zermelo’s original axiom set): the existence of any object\n(guaranteed by logic unless we use a free logic) along with separation\nwill do the trick, and even if we use a free logic the set provided by\nInfinity will serve (the axiom of Infinity can be reframed to say that\nthere is a set which contains all sets with no elements (without\npresupposing that there are any) and is closed under the desired\nsuccessor operation). \nEvery axiom of Zermelo set theory except Choice is an axiom of naive\nset theory. Zermelo chose enough axioms so that the mathematical\napplications of set theory could be carried out and restricted the\naxioms sufficiently that the paradoxes could not apparently be\nderived. \nThe most general comprehension axiom of Z is the axiom of\nSeparation. If we try to replicate the Russell paradox by constructing\nthe set \\(R' = \\{x \\in A \\mid x \\not\\in x\\}\\), we discover that\n\\(R' \\in R' \\leftrightarrow R' \\in A \\amp R' \\not\\in R'\\), from which\nwe deduce \\(R' \\not\\in A\\). For any set \\(A\\), we can construct a set\nwhich does not belong to it. Another way to put this is that\nZ proves that there is no universal set: if we had the\nuniversal set \\(V\\), we would have naive comprehension, because we\ncould define \\(\\{x \\mid P(x)\\}\\) as \\(\\{x \\in V \\mid P(x)\\}\\)\nfor any property \\(P(x)\\), including the fatal \\(x \\not\\in x\\). \nIn order to apply the axiom of separation, we need to have some sets\n\\(A\\) from which to carve out subsets using properties. The other\naxioms allow the construction of a lot of sets (all sets needed for\nclassical mathematics outside of set theory, though not all of the\nsets that even Cantor had constructed with apparent safety). \nThe elimination of the universal set seems to arouse resistance in\nsome quarters (many of the alternative set theories recover it, and\nthe theories with sets and classes recover at least a universe of all\nsets). On the other hand, the elimination of the universal set seems\nto go along with Cantor’s idea that the problem with the\nparadoxes was that they involved Absolutely Infinite\ncollections—purported “sets” that are too large. \nZermelo set theory came to be modified in certain ways. \nThe formulation of the axiom of separation was made explicit:\n“for each formula \\(\\phi\\) of the first-order language with\nequality and membership, \\(\\{x \\in A \\mid \\phi \\}\\) exists”.\nZermelo’s original formulation referred more vaguely to\nproperties in general (and Zermelo himself seems to have objected to\nthe modern formulation as too restrictive). \nThe non-sets are usually abandoned (so the formulation of\nExtensionality is stronger) though ZFA (Zermelo-Fraenkel set\ntheory with atoms) was used in the first independence proofs for the\nAxiom of Choice. \nThe axiom scheme of Replacement was added by Fraenkel to make it\npossible to construct larger sets (even \\(\\aleph_{\\omega}\\) cannot be\nproved to exist in Zermelo set theory). The basic idea is that any\ncollection the same size as a set is a set, which can be logically\nformulated as follows: if \\(\\phi(x,y)\\) is a functional formula\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z[(\\phi(x,y) \\amp \\phi(x,z)) \\rightarrow y\n= z\\)] and \\(A\\) is a set then there is a set \\(\\{y \\mid \\exists x\n\\in A(\\phi(x,y))\\}\\). \nThe axiom scheme of Foundation was added as a definite conception of\nwhat the universe of sets is like. The idea of the\ncumulative hierarchy of sets is that we construct sets in a sequence\nof stages indexed by the ordinals: at stage 0, the empty set is\nconstructed; at stage \\(\\alpha + 1\\), all subsets of the set of stage\n\\(\\alpha\\) sets are constructed; at a limit stage \\(\\lambda\\), the\nunion of all stages with index less than \\(\\lambda\\) is constructed.\nReplacement is important for the implementation of this idea, as\nZ only permits one to construct sets belonging to the stages\n\\(V_n\\) and \\(V_{\\omega +n}\\) for \\(n\\) a natural number (we use the\nnotation \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) for the collection of all sets constructed at\nstage \\(\\alpha)\\). The intention of the Foundation Axiom is to assert\nthat every set belongs to some \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) ; the commonest\nformulation is the mysterious assertion that for any nonempty set\n\\(A\\), there is an element \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) such that \\(x\\) is disjoint\nfrom \\(A\\). To see that this is at least implied by Foundation,\nconsider that there must be a smallest \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(A\\)\nmeets \\(V_{\\alpha}\\), and any \\(x\\) in this \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) will have\nelements (if any) only of smaller rank and so not in \\(A\\). \nZermelo set theory has difficulties with the cumulative hierarchy. The\nusual form of the Zermelo axioms (or Zermelo’s original form)\ndoes not prove the existence of \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) as a set unless\n\\(\\alpha\\) is finite. If the Axiom of Infinity is reformulated to\nassert the existence of \\(V_{\\omega}\\), then the ranks proved to exist\nas sets by Zermelo set theory are exactly those which appear in the\nnatural model \\(V_{\\omega +\\omega}\\) of this theory. Also, Zermelo set\ntheory does not prove the existence of transitive closures of sets,\nwhich makes it difficult to assign ranks to sets in general. Zermelo\nset theory plus the assertion that every set belongs to a rank\n\\(V_{\\alpha}\\) which is a set implies Foundation, the existence of\nexpected ranks \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) (not the existence of such ranks for all\nordinals \\(\\alpha\\) but the existence of such a rank containing each\nset which can be shown to exist), and the existence of transitive\nclosures, and can be interpreted in Zermelo set theory without\nadditional assumptions. \nThe Axiom of Choice is an object of suspicion to some mathematicians\nbecause it is not constructive. It has become customary to indicate\nwhen a proof in set theory uses Choice, although most mathematicians\naccept it as an axiom. The Axiom of Replacement is sometimes replaced\nwith the Axiom of Collection, which asserts, for any formula\n\\(\\phi(x,y)\\): \nNote that \\(\\phi\\) here does not need to be functional; if for every\n\\(x \\in A\\), there are some \\(y\\)s such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\), there is\na set such that for every \\(x \\in A\\), there is \\(y\\) in that\nset such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\). One way to build this set is to\ntake, for each \\(x \\in A\\), all the \\(y\\)s of minimal rank such that\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\) and put them in \\(C\\). In the presence of all other\naxioms of ZFC, Replacement and Collection are equivalent;\nwhen the axiomatics is perturbed (or when the logic is perturbed, as\nin intuitionistic set theory) the difference becomes important. The\nAxiom of Foundation is equivalent to \\(\\in\\)-Induction here but not in\nother contexts: \\(\\in\\)-Induction is the assertion that for any\nformula \\(\\phi\\):  \ni.e., anything which is true of any set if it is true of all its\nelements is true of every set without exception. \nA common criticism of Zermelo set theory is that it is an ad\nhoc selection of axioms chosen to avoid paradox, and we have no\nreason to believe that it actually achieves this end. We believe such\nobjections to be unfounded, for two reasons. The first is that the\ntheory of types (which is the result of a principled single\nmodification of naive set theory) is easily shown to be precisely\nequivalent in consistency strength and expressive power to Z\nwith the restriction that all quantifiers in the formulas \\(\\phi\\) in\ninstances of separation must be bounded in a set; this casts doubt on\nthe idea that the choice of axioms in Z is particularly\narbitrary. The fact that the von Neumann-Gödel-Bernays class\ntheory (discussed below) turns out to be a conservative extension of\nZFC suggests that full ZFC is a precise formulation\nof Cantor’s ideas about the Absolute Infinite (and so not\narbitrary). Further, the introduction of the Foundation Axiom\nidentifies the set theories of this class as the theories of a\nparticular class of structures (the well-founded sets) of which the\nZermelo axioms certainly seem to hold (whether Replacement holds so\nevidently is another matter). \nThese theories are frequently extended with large cardinal axioms (the\nexistence of inaccessible cardinals, Mahlo cardinals, weakly compact\ncardinals, measurable cardinals and so forth). These do not to us\nsignal a new kind of set theory, but represent answers to the question\nas to how large the universe of Zermelo-style set theory is. \nThe choice of Zermelo set theory (leaving aside whether one goes on to\nZFC) rules out the use of equivalence classes of equinumerous\nsets as cardinals (and so the use of the Frege natural numbers) or the\nuse of equivalence classes of well-orderings as ordinals. There is no\ndifficulty with the use of the Dedekind cut formulation of the reals\n(once the rationals have been introduced). Instead of the equivalence\nclass formulations of cardinal and ordinal numbers, the von\nNeumann ordinals are used: a von Neumann ordinal is a transitive\nset (all of its elements are among its subsets) which is well-ordered\nby membership. The order type of a well-ordering is the von Neumann\nordinal of the same length (the axiom of Replacement is needed to\nprove that every set well-ordering has an order type; this can fail to\nbe true in Zermelo set theory, where the von Neumann ordinal \\(\\omega\n+ \\omega\\) cannot be proven to exist but there are certainly\nwell-orderings of this and longer types). The cardinal number \\(|A|\\)\nis defined as the smallest order type of a well-ordering of \\(A\\)\n(this requires Choice to work; without choice, we can use Foundation\nto define the cardinal of a set \\(A\\) as the set of all sets\nequinumerous with \\(A\\) and belonging to the first \\(V_{\\alpha}\\)\ncontaining sets equinumerous with \\(A)\\). This is one respect in which\nCantor’s ideas do not agree with the modern conception; he\nappears to have thought that he could define at least cardinal numbers\nas equivalence classes (or at least that is one way to interpret what\nhe says), although such equivalence classes would of course be\nAbsolutely Infinite. \nSome weaker subsystems of ZFC are used. Zermelo set theory,\nthe system Z described above, is still studied. The further\nrestriction of the axiom of separation to formulas in which all\nquantifiers are bounded in sets \\((\\Delta_0\\) separation) yields\n“bounded Zermelo set theory” or “Mac Lane set\ntheory”, so called because it has been advocated as a foundation\nfor mathematics by Saunders Mac Lane (1986). It is interesting to\nobserve that Mac Lane set theory is precisely equivalent in\nconsistency strength and expressive power to TST with the\nAxiom of Infinity. Z is strictly stronger than Mac Lane set\ntheory; the former theory proves the consistency of the latter. See\nMathias 2001a for an extensive discussion. \nThe set theory KPU (Kripke-Platek set theory with urelements,\nfor which see Barwise 1975) is of interest for technical reasons in\nmodel theory. The axioms of KPU are the weak Extensionality\nwhich allows urelements, Pairing, Union, \\(\\Delta_0\\) separation,\n\\(\\Delta_0\\) collection, and \\(\\in\\)-induction for arbitrary formulas.\nNote the absence of Power Set. The technical advantage of KPU\nis that all of its constructions are “absolute” in a\nsuitable sense. This makes the theory suitable for the development of\nan extension of recursion theory to sets. \nThe dominance of ZFC is nowhere more evident than in the\ngreat enthusiasm and sense of a new departure found in reactions to\nthe very slight variation of this kind of set theory embodied in\nversions of ZFC without the foundation axiom. It should be\nnoted that the Foundation Axiom was not part of the original\nsystem! \nWe describe two theories out of a range of possible theories of\nhypersets (Zermelo-Frankel set theory without foundation). A\nsource for theories of this kind is Aczel 1988. \nIn the following paragraphs, we will use the term “graph”\nfor a relation, and “extensional graph” for a relation\n\\(R\\) satisfying  \nA decoration of a graph \\(G\\) is a function \\(f\\) with the property\nthat \\(f(x) = \\{f(y) \\mid yGx\\}\\) for all \\(x\\) in the field of\n\\(G\\). In ZFC, all well-founded relations have unique\ndecorations, and non-well-founded relations have no decorations. Aczel\nproposed his Anti-Foundation Axiom: every set graph has a unique\ndecoration. Maurice Boffa considered a stronger axiom: every\npartial, injective decoration of an extensional set graph \\(G\\) whose\ndomain contains the \\(G\\)-preimages of all its elements can be\nextended to an injective decoration of all of \\(G\\). \nThe Aczel system is distinct from the Boffa system in having fewer\nill-founded objects. For example, the Aczel theory proves that there\nis just one object which is its own sole element, while the Boffa\ntheory provides a proper class of such objects. The Aczel system has\nbeen especially popular, and we ourselves witnessed a great deal of\nenthusiasm for this subversion of the cumulative hierarchy. We are\ndoubtless not the only ones to point this out, but we did notice and\npoint out to others that at least the Aczel theory has a perfectly\nobvious analogue of the cumulative hierarchy. If \\(A_{\\alpha}\\) is a\nrank, the successor rank \\(A_{\\alpha +1}\\) will consist of all those\nsets which can be associated with graphs \\(G\\) with a selected point\n\\(t\\) with all elements of the field of \\(G\\) taken from\n\\(A_{\\alpha}\\). The zero and limit ranks are constructed just as in\nZFC. Every set belongs to an \\(A_{\\alpha}\\) for \\(\\alpha\\)\nless than or equal to the cardinality of its transitive closure. (It\nseems harder to impose rank on the world of the Boffa theory, though\nit can be done: the proper class of self-singletons is an obvious\ndifficulty, to begin with!). \nIt is true (and has been the object of applications in computer\nscience) that it is useful to admit reflexive structures for some\npurposes. The kind of reflexivity permitted by Aczel’s theory\nhas been useful for some such applications. However, such structures\nare modelled in well-founded set theory (using relations other than\nmembership) with hardly more difficulty, and the reflexivity admitted\nby Aczel’s theory (or even by a more liberal theory like that of\nBoffa) doesn’t come near the kind of non-well-foundedness found\nin genuinely alternative set theories, especially those with universal\nset. These theories are close variants of the usual theory\nZFC, caused by perturbing the last axiom to be added to this\nsystem historically (although, to be fair, the Axiom of Foundation is\nthe one which arguably defines the unique structure which the usual\nset theory is about; the anti-foundation axioms thus invite us to\ncontemplate different, even if closely related, universal\nstructures). \nEven those mathematicians who accepted the Zermelo-style set theories\nas the standard (most of them!) often found themselves wanting to talk\nabout “all sets”, or “all ordinals”, or\nsimilar concepts. \nVon Neumann (who actually formulated a theory of functions, not sets),\nGödel, and Bernays developed closely related systems which admit,\nin addition to the sets found in ZFC, general collections of\nthese sets. (In Hallett 1984, it is argued that the system of von\nNeumann was the first system in which the Axiom of Replacement was\nimplemented correctly [there were technical problems with\nFraenkel’s formulation], so it may actually be the first\nimplementation of ZFC.) \nWe present a theory of this kind. Its objects are classes.\nAmong the classes we identify those which are elements as sets. \nAxiom of extensionality: Classes with the same\nelements are the same. \nDefinition: A class \\(x\\) is a set just in\ncase there is a class \\(y\\) such that \\(x \\in y\\). A class which is\nnot a set is said to be a proper class. \nAxiom of class comprehension: For any formula\n\\(\\phi(x)\\) which involves quantification only over all sets (not over\nall classes), there is a class \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) which\ncontains exactly those sets \\(x\\) for which \\(\\phi(x)\\) is\ntrue. \nThe axiom scheme of class comprehension with quantification only over\nsets admits a finite axiomatization (a finite selection of formulas\n\\(\\phi\\) (most with parameters) suffices) and was historically first\npresented in this way. It is an immediate consequence of class\ncomprehension that the Russell class \\(\\{x \\mid x \\not\\in x\\}\\)\ncannot be a set (so there is at least one proper class). \nAxiom of limitation of size: A class \\(C\\) is proper\nif and only if there is a class bijection between \\(C\\) and the\nuniverse. \nThis elegant axiom is essentially due to von Neumann. A class\nbijection is a class of ordered pairs; there might be pathology here\nif we did not have enough pairs as sets, but other axioms do provide\nfor their existence. It is interesting to observe that this axiom\nimplies Replacement (a class which is the same size as a set cannot be\nthe same size as the universe) and, surprisingly, implies Choice (the\nvon Neumann ordinals make up a proper class essentially by the\nBurali-Forti paradox, so the universe must be the same size as the\nclass of ordinals, and the class bijection between the universe and\nthe ordinals allows us to define a global well-ordering of the\nuniverse, whose existence immediately implies Choice). \nAlthough Class Comprehension and Limitation of Size appear to tell us\nexactly what classes there are and what sets there are, more axioms\nare required to make our universe large enough. These can be taken to\nbe the axioms of Z (other than extensionality and choice,\nwhich are not needed): the sethood of pairs of sets, unions of sets,\npower sets of sets, and the existence of an infinite set are enough to\ngive us the world of ZFC. Foundation is usually added. The\nresulting theory is a conservative extension of ZFC: it\nproves all the theorems of ZFC about sets, and it does not\nprove any theorem about sets which is not provable in ZFC.\nFor those with qualms about choice (or about global choice),\nLimitation of Size can be restricted to merely assert that the image\nof a set under a class function is a set. \nWe have two comments about this. First, the mental furniture of set\ntheorists does seem to include proper classes, though usually it is\nimportant to them that all talk of proper classes can be explained\naway (the proper classes are in some sense “virtual”).\nSecond, this theory (especially the version with the strong axiom of\nLimitation of Size) seems to capture the intuition of Cantor about the\nAbsolute Infinite. \nA stronger theory with classes, but still essentially a version of\nstandard set theory, is the Kelley-Morse set theory in which Class\nComprehension is strengthened to allow quantification over all classes\nin the formulas defining classes. Kelley-Morse set theory is not\nfinitely axiomatizable, and it is stronger than ZFC in the\nsense that it allows a proof of the consistency of ZFC. \nThe next theory we present was actually embedded in the set\ntheoretical proposals of Paul Finsler, which were (taken as a whole)\nincoherent (see the notes on Finsler set theory available in the\n Other Internet Resources).\n Ackermann later (and apparently independently) presented it again. It\nis to all appearances a different theory from the standard one (it is\nour first genuine “alternative set theory”) but it turns\nout to be essentially the same theory as ZF (and choice can\nbe added to make it essentially the same as ZFC). \nAckermann set theory is a theory of classes in which some\nclasses are sets, but there is no simple definition of which\nclasses are sets (in fact, the whole power of the theory is that the\nnotion of set is indefinable!) \nAll objects are classes. The primitive notions are equality,\nmembership and sethood. The axioms are \nAxiom of extensionality: Classes with the same\nelements are equal. \nAxiom of class comprehension: For any formula\n\\(\\phi\\), there is a class \\(\\{x \\in V \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) whose\nelements are exactly the sets \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi(x) (V\\) here\ndenotes the class of all sets). [But note that it is not the case here\nthat all elements of classes are sets]. \nAxiom of elements: Any element of a set is a set. \nAxiom of subsets: Any subset of a set is a set. \nAxiom of set comprehension: For any formula \\(\\phi\n(x)\\) which does not mention the sethood predicate and in which all\nfree variables other than \\(x\\) denote sets, and which further has the\nproperty that \\(\\phi(x)\\) is only true of sets \\(x\\), the class \\(\\{x\n\\mid \\phi \\}\\) (which exists by Class Comprehension since all\nsuitable \\(x\\) are sets) is a set. \nOne can conveniently add axioms of Foundation and Choice to this\nsystem. \nTo see the point (mainly, to understand what Set Comprehension says)\nit is a good idea to go through some derivations. \nThe formula \\(x = a \\lor x = b\\) (where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are sets) does\nnot mention sethood, has only the sets \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as parameters,\nand is true only of sets. Thus it defines a set, and Pairing is true\nfor sets. \nThe formula \\(\\exists y(x \\in y \\amp y \\in a)\\), where \\(a\\) is a set,\ndoes not mention sethood, has only the set \\(a\\) as a parameter, and\nis true only of sets by the Axiom of Elements (any witness \\(y\\)\nbelongs to the set \\(a\\), so \\(y\\) is a set, and \\(x\\) belongs to the\nset \\(y\\), so \\(x\\) is a set). Thus Union is true for sets. \nThe formula \\(\\forall y(y \\in x \\rightarrow y \\in a)\\), where \\(a\\) is\na set, does not mention sethood, has only the set \\(a\\) as a\nparameter, and is true only of sets by the Axiom of Subsets. Thus\nPower Set is true for sets. \nThe big surprise is that this system proves Infinity. The formula \\(x\n\\ne x\\) clearly defines a set, the empty set \\(\\varnothing\\). Consider\nthe formula \nThis formula does not mention sethood and has no parameters (or just\nthe set parameter \\(\\varnothing)\\). The class \\(V\\) of all sets has\n\\(\\varnothing\\) as a member and contains \\(y \\cup \\{y\\}\\) if it\ncontains \\(y\\) by Pairing and Union for sets (already shown). Thus any\n\\(x\\) satisfying this formula is a set, whence the extension of the\nformula is a set (clearly the usual set of von Neumann natural\nnumbers). So Infinity is true in the sets of Ackermann set theory. \nIt is possible (but harder) to prove Replacement as well in the realm\nof well-founded sets (which can be the entire universe of sets if\nFoundation for classes is added as an axiom). It is demonstrable that\nthe theorems of Ackermann set theory about well-founded sets are\nexactly the theorems of ZF (Lévy 1959; Reinhardt\n1970). \nWe attempt to motivate this theory (in terms of the cumulative\nhierarchy). Think of classes as collections which merely exist\npotentially. The sets are those classes which actually get\nconstructed. Extensionality for classes seems unproblematic. All\ncollections of the actual sets could have been constructed by\nconstructing one more stage of the cumulative hierarchy: this\njustifies class comprehension. Elements of actual sets are actual\nsets; subcollections of actual sets are actual sets; these do not seem\nproblematic. Finally, we assert that any collection of classes which\nis defined without reference to the realm of actual sets, which is\ndefined in terms of specific objects which are actual, and which turns\nout only to contain actual elements is actual. When one gets\none’s mind around this last assertion, it can seem reasonable. A\nparticular thing to note about such a definition is that it is\n“absolute”: the collection of all actual sets is a proper\nclass and not itself an actual set, because we are not committed to\nstopping the construction of actual sets at any particular point; but\nthe elements of a collection satisfying the conditions of set\ncomprehension do not depend on how many potential collections we make\nactual (this is why the actuality predicate is not allowed to appear\nin the “defining” formula). \nIt may be a minority opinion, but we believe (after some\ncontemplation) that the Ackermann axioms have their own distinctive\nphilosophical motivation which deserves consideration, particularly\nsince it turns out to yield basically the same theory as ZF\nfrom an apparently quite different starting point. \nAckermann set theory actually proves that there are classes which have\nnon-set classes as elements; the difference between sets and classes\nprovably cannot be as in von Neumann-Gödel-Bernays class theory.\nA quick proof of this concerns ordinals. There is a proper class von\nNeumann ordinal \\(\\Omega\\), the class of all set von Neumann ordinals.\nWe can prove the existence of \\(\\Omega + 1\\) using set comprehension:\nif \\(\\Omega\\) were the last ordinal, then “\\(x\\) is a von\nNeumann ordinal with a successor” would be a predicate not\nmentioning sethood, with no parameters (so all parameters sets), and\ntrue only of sets. But this would make the class of all set ordinals a\nset, and the class of all set ordinals is \\(\\Omega\\) itself, which\nwould lead to the Burali-Forti paradox. So \\(\\Omega + 1\\) must exist,\nand is a proper class with the proper class \\(\\Omega\\) as an\nelement. \nThere is a meta-theorem of ZF called the Reflection Principle\nwhich asserts that any first-order assertion which is true of the\nuniverse \\(V\\) is also true of some set. This means that for any\nparticular proof in ZF, there is a set \\(M\\) which might as\nwell be the universe (because any proof uses only finitely many\naxioms). A suitable such set \\(M\\) can be construed as the universe of\nsets and the actual universe \\(V\\) can be construed as the universe of\nclasses. The set \\(M\\) has the closure properties asserted in Elements\nand Subsets if it is a limit rank; it can be chosen to have as many of\nthe closure properties asserted in Set Comprehension (translated into\nterms of \\(M)\\) as a proof in Ackermann set theory requires. This\nmachinery is what is used to show that Ackermann set theory proves\nnothing about sets that ZF cannot prove: one translates a\nproof in Ackermann set theory into a proof in ZFC using the\nReflection Principle. \nWe have alluded already to the fact that the simple typed theory of\nsets TST can be shown to be equivalent to an untyped theory\n(Mac Lane set theory, aka bounded Zermelo set theory). We briefly\nindicate how to do this: choose any map \\(f\\) in the model which is an\ninjection with domain the set of singletons of type 0 objects and\nrange included in type 1 (the identity on singletons of type 0 objects\nis an example). Identify each type 0 object \\(x^0\\) with the type 1\nobject \\(f (\\{x^0\\})\\); then introduce exactly those identifications\nbetween objects of different types which are required by\nextensionality: every type 0 object is identified with a type 1\nobject, and an easy meta-induction shows that every type \\(n\\) object\nis identified with some type \\(n + 1\\) object. The resulting structure\nwill satisfy all the axioms of Zermelo set theory except Separation,\nand will satisfy all instances of Separation in which each quantifier\nis bounded in a set (this boundedness comes in because each instance\nof Comprehension in TST has each quantifier bounded in a\ntype, which becomes a bounding set for that quantifier in the\ninterpretation of Mac Lane set theory). It will satisfy Infinity and\nChoice if the original model of TST satisfies these axioms.\nThe simplest map \\(f\\) is just the identity on singletons of type 0\nobjects, which will have the effect of identifying each type 0 object\nwith its own singleton (a failure of foundation). It can be arranged\nfor the structure to satisfy Foundation: for example, if Choice holds\ntype 0 can be well-ordered and each element of type 0 identified with\nthe corresponding segment in the well-ordering, so that type 0 becomes\na von Neumann ordinal. (A structure of this kind will never model\nReplacement, as there will be a countable sequence of cardinals [the\ncardinalities of the types] which is definable and cofinal below the\ncardinality of the universe.) See Mathias 2001a for a full\naccount. \nQuine’s set theory New Foundations (abbreviated NF,\nproposed in 1937 in his paper “New Foundations for Mathematical\nLogic”), is also based on a procedure for identifying the objects\nin successive types in order to obtain an untyped theory. However, in\nthe case of NF and related theories, the idea is to identify\nthe entirety of type \\(n + 1\\) with type \\(n\\); the type hierarchy is\nto be collapsed completely. An obvious difficulty with this is that\nCantor’s theorem suggests that type \\(n + 1\\) (being the\n“power set” of type \\(n)\\) should be intrinsically larger\nthan type \\(n\\) (and in some senses this is demonstrably true). \nWe first outline the reason that Quine believed that it might be\npossible to collapse the type hierarchy. We recall from\n above:\n  \nWe admit sorts of object indexed by the natural numbers (this is\npurely a typographical convenience; no actual reference to natural\nnumbers is involved). Type 0 is inhabited by “individuals”\nwith no specified structure. Type 1 is inhabited by sets of type 0\nobjects, and in general type \\(n + 1\\) is inhabited by sets of type\n\\(n\\) objects. \nThe type system is enforced by the grammar of the language. Atomic\nsentences are equations or membership statements, and they are only\nwell-formed if they take one of the forms \\(x^{n} = y^{n}\\) or \\(x^{n}\n\\in y^{n+1}\\). \nThe axioms of extensionality of TST take the form \nthere is a separate axiom for each \\(n\\). \nThe axioms of comprehension of TST take the form (for any\nchoice of a type \\(n\\), a formula \\(\\phi\\), and a variable \\(A^{n+1}\\)\nnot free in \\(\\phi)\\) \nIt is interesting to observe that the axioms of TST are\nprecisely analogous to those of naive set theory. \nFor any formula \\(\\phi\\), define \\(\\phi^+\\) as the formula obtained by\nraising every type index on a variable in \\(\\phi\\) by one. Quine\nobserves that any proof of \\(\\phi\\) can be converted into a proof of\n\\(\\phi^+\\) by raising all type indices in the original proof. Further,\nevery object \\(\\{x^n \\mid \\phi \\}^{n+1}\\) that the theory permits\nus to define has a precise analogue \\(\\{x^{n+1} \\mid\n\\phi^{+}\\}^{n+2}\\) in the next higher type; this can be iterated to\nproduce “copies” of any defined object in each higher\ntype. \nFor example, the Frege definition of the natural numbers works in\nTST. The number \\(3^2\\) can be defined as the (type 2) set of\nall (type 1) sets with three (type 0) elements. The number \\(3^3\\) can\nbe defined as the (type 3) set of all (type 2) sets with three (type\n1) elements. The number \\(3^{27}\\) can be defined as the (type 27) set\nof all (type 26) sets with three (type 25) elements. And so forth. Our\nlogic does not even permit us to say that these are a sequence of\ndistinct objects; we cannot ask the question as to whether they are\nequal or not. \nQuine suggested, in effect, that we tentatively suppose that \\(\\phi\n\\equiv \\phi^+\\) for all \\(\\phi\\) ; it is not just the case that if we\ncan prove \\(\\phi\\), we can prove \\(\\phi^+\\), but that the truth values\nof these sentences are the same. It then becomes strongly tempting to\nidentify \\(\\{x^n \\mid \\phi \\}^{n+1}\\) with \\(\\{x^{n+1} \\mid\n\\phi^{+}\\}^{n+2}\\), since anything we can say about these two objects\nis the same (and our new assumption implies that we will assign the\nsame truth values to corresponding assertions about these two\nobjects). \nThe theory NF which we obtain can be described briefly (but\ndeceptively) as being the first-order untyped theory with equality and\nmembership having the same axioms as TST but without the\ndistinctions of type. If this is not read very carefully, it may be\nseen as implying that we have adopted the comprehension axioms of\nnaive set theory, \nfor each formula \\(\\phi\\). But we have not. We have only adopted those\naxioms for formulas \\(\\phi\\) which can be obtained from formulas of\nTST by dropping distinctions of type between the variables\n(without introducing any identifications between variables of\ndifferent types). For example, there is no way that \\(x \\not\\in x\\)\ncan be obtained by dropping distinctions of type from a formula of\nTST, without identifying two variables of different type.\nFormulas of the untyped language of set theory in which it is possible\nto assign a type to each variable (the same type wherever it occurs)\nin such a way as to get a formula of TST are said to be\nstratified. The axioms of NF are strong\nextensionality (no non-sets) and stratified comprehension. \nThough the set \\(\\{x \\mid x \\not\\in x\\}\\) is not provided by\nstratified comprehension, some other sets which are not found in any\nvariant of Zermelo set theory are provided. For example, \\(x = x\\) is\na stratified formula, and the universal set \\(V = \\{x \\mid x =\nx\\}\\) is provided by an instance of comprehension. Moreover, \\(V \\in\nV\\) is true. \nAll mathematical constructions which can be carried out in\nTST can be carried out in NF. For example, the Frege\nnatural numbers can be constructed, and so can the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\)\nof Frege natural numbers. For example, the Frege natural number 1, the\nset of all one-element sets, is provided by NF. \nNo contradictions are known to follow from NF, but some\nuncomfortable consequences do follow. The Axiom of Choice is known to\nfail in NF: Specker (1953) proved that the universe cannot be\nwell-ordered. (Since the universe cannot be well-ordered, it follows\nthat the “Axiom” of Infinity is a theorem of NF:\nif the universe were finite, it could be well-ordered.) This might be\nthought to be what one would expect on adopting such a dangerous\ncomprehension scheme, but this turns out not to be the problem. The\nproblem is with extensionality. \nJensen (1968) showed that NFU (New Foundations with urelements), the version of New Foundations\nin which extensionality is weakened to allow many non-sets (as\ndescribed above under naive set theory) is consistent, is consistent\nwith Infinity and Choice, and is also consistent with the negation of\nInfinity (which of course implies Choice). NFU, which has the\nfull stratified comprehension axiom of NF with all its\nfrighteningly big sets, is weaker in consistency strength than Peano\narithmetic; NFU + Infinity + Choice is of the same strength\nas TST with Infinity and Choice or Mac Lane set theory. \nSome other fragments of NF, obtained by weakening\ncomprehension rather than extensionality, are known to be consistent.\nNF3, the version of NF in which one\naccepts only those instances of the axiom of comprehension which can\nbe typed using three types, was shown to be consistent by Grishin\n(1969). \nNFP (predicative NF), the version of NF in which one accepts only\ninstances of the axiom of comprehension which can be typed so as to be\ninstances of comprehension of predicative TST (described\nabove under type theories) was shown to be consistent by Marcel\nCrabbé (1982). He also demonstrated the consistency of the\ntheory NFI  in which one allows all instances of stratified\ncomprehension in which no variable appears of type higher than that\nassigned to the set being defined (bound variables of the same type as\nthat of the set being defined are permitted, which allows some\nimpredicativity).  One would like to read the name NFI as “impredicative NF” but one cannot, as it is more impredicative than NFP, not more impredicative than NF itself. \nNF3+Infinity has the same strength as second-order\narithmetic. So does NFI (which has just enough\nimpredicativity to define the natural numbers, and not enough for the\nLeast Upper Bound Axiom). NFP is equivalent to a weaker\nfragment of arithmetic, but does (unlike NFU) prove Infinity:\nthis is the only application of the Specker proof of\nthe negation of the Axiom of Choice to a provably consistent theory. Either Union is\ntrue (in which case we readily get all of NF and\nSpecker’s proof of Infinity goes through) or Union is not true,\nin which case we note that all finite sets have unions, so there must\nbe an infinite set. NF3 has considerable interest\nfor a surprising reason: it turns out that all infinite\nmodels of TST3 (simple type theory with three\ntypes) satisfy the ambiguity schema \\(\\phi \\equiv \\phi^+\\) (of course\nthis only makes sense for formulas with one or two types) and this\nturns out to be enough to show that for any infinite model of\nTST3 there is a model of NF3\nwith the same theory. NF4 is the same theory as\nNF (Grishin 1969), and we have no idea how to get a model of\nTST4 to satisfy ambiguity. \nVery recently, Sergei Tupailo (2010) has proved the consistency of\nNFSI, the fragment of NF consisting of\nextensionality and those instances of Comprehension (\\(\\{x \\in A\n\\mid \\phi \\}\\) exists) which are stratified and in which the\nvariable \\(x\\) is assigned the lowest type. Tupailo’s proof is\nhighly technical, but Marcel Crabbé pointed out that a\nstructure for the language of set theory in which the sets are exactly\nthe finite and cofinite collections satisfies this theory (so it is\nvery weak). It should be noted that Tupailo’s model of\nNFSI satisfies additional propositions of interest not\nsatisfied by the very simple model of Crabbé, such as the\nexistence of each Frege natural number. It is of some interest whether\nthis new fragment represents an independent way of getting a\nconsistent fragment of NF. Note that\nNFU+NFSI is NF because NFSI has\nstrong extensionality. Also, NFP+NFSI is NF\nbecause NFSI includes Union. The relationship of\nNFSI to NF\\(_3\\) has been clarified by Marcel\nCrabbé in 2016. Tupailo’s theory is shown not to be a\nfragment of Grishin’s, and thus represents a fourth known method\nof getting consistent fragments. \nOf these set theories, only NFU with Infinity, Choice and\npossibly further strong axioms of infinity (of which more anon) is\nreally mathematically serviceable. We examine the construction of\nmodels of this theory and the way mathematics works inside this\ntheory. A source for this development is Holmes 1998. Rosser \n1973 develops the foundations of mathematics in NF: it can\nadapted to NFU fairly easily). \nA model of NFU can be constructed as follows. Well-known\nresults of model theory allow the construction of a nonstandard model\nof ZFC (actually, a model of Mac Lane set theory suffices)\nwith an external automorphism \\(j\\) which moves a rank \\(V_{\\alpha}\\).\nWe stipulate without loss of generality that \\(j(\\alpha) \\lt \\alpha\\).\nThe universe of our model of NFU will be \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) and\nthe membership relation will be defined as  \n(where \\(\\in\\) is the membership relation of the nonstandard model).\nThe proof that this is a model of NFU is not long, but it is\ninvolved enough that we refer the reader elsewhere. The basic idea is\nthat the automorphism allows us to code the (apparent) power set\n\\(V_{\\alpha +1}\\) of our universe \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) into the\n“smaller” \\(V_{j(\\alpha)+1}\\) which is included in our\nuniverse; the left over objects in \\(V_{\\alpha} - V_{j(\\alpha)+1}\\)\nbecome urelements. Note that \\(V_{\\alpha} - V_{j(\\alpha)+1}\\) is most\nof the domain of the model of NFU in a quite strong sense:\nalmost all of the universe is made up of urelements (note that each\n\\(V_{\\beta +1}\\) is the power set of \\(V_{\\beta}\\), and so is strictly\nlarger in size, and not one but many stages intervene between\n\\(V_{j(\\alpha)+1}\\) (the collection of “sets”) and\n\\(V_{\\alpha}\\) (the “universe”)). This construction is\nrelated to the construction used by Jensen, but is apparently first\ndescribed explicitly in Boffa 1988. \nIn any model of NFU, a structure which looks just like one of\nthese models can be constructed in the isomorphism classes of\nwell-founded extensional relations. The theory of isomorphism classes\nof well-founded extensional relations with a top element looks like\nthe theory of (an initial segment of) the usual cumulative hierarchy,\nbecause every set in Zermelo-style set theory is uniquely determined\nby the isomorphism type of the restriction of the membership relation\nto its transitive closure. The surprise is that we not only see a\nstructure which looks like an initial segment of the cumulative\nhierarchy: we also see an external endomorphism of this structure\nwhich moves a rank (and therefore cannot be a set), in terms of which\nwe can replicate the model construction above and get an\ninterpretation of NFU of this kind inside NFU! The\nendomorphism is induced by the map \\(T\\) which sends the isomorphism\ntype of a relation \\(R\\) to the isomorphism type of \\(R^{\\iota} = \\{\n\\langle \\{x\\}, \\{y\\}\\rangle \\mid xRy\\}\\). There is no reason to\nbelieve that \\(T\\) is a function: it sends any relation \\(R\\) to a\nrelation \\(R^{\\iota}\\) which is one type higher in terms of\nTST. It is demonstrable that \\(T\\) on the isomorphism types\nof well-founded extensional relations is not a set function (we will\nnot show this here, but our discussion of the Burali-Forti paradox\nbelow should give a good idea of the reasons for this). See Holmes\n(1998) for the full discussion. \nThis suggests that the underlying world view of NFU, in spite\nof the presence of the universal set, Frege natural numbers, and other\nlarge objects, may not be that different from the world view of\nZermelo-style set theory; we build models of NFU in a certain\nway in Zermelo-style set theory, and NFU itself reflects this\nkind of construction internally. A further, surprising result (Holmes\n2012) is that in models of NFU constructed from a nonstandard\n\\(V_{\\alpha}\\) with automorphism as above, the membership relation on\nthe nonstandard \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) is first-order definable (in a very\nelaborate way) in terms of the relation \\(\\in_{NFU}\\); this is very\nsurprising, since it seems superficially as if all information about\nthe extensions of the urelements has been discarded in this\nconstruction. But this turns out not to be the case (and this means\nthat the urelements, which seem to have no internal information,\nnonetheless have a great deal of structure in these models). \nModels of NFU can have a “finite” (but externally\ninfinite) universe if the ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) in the construction is a\nnonstandard natural number. If \\(\\alpha\\) is infinite, the model of\nNFU will satisfy Infinity. If the Axiom of Choice holds in\nthe model of Zermelo-style set theory, it will hold in the model of\nNFU. \nNow we look at the mathematical universe according to NFU,\nrather than looking at models of NFU from the outside. \nThe Frege construction of the natural numbers works perfectly in\nNFU. If Infinity holds, there will be no last natural number\nand we can define the usual set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of natural numbers just\nas we did above. \nAny of the usual ordered pair constructions works in NFU. The\nusual Kuratowski pair is inconvenient in NF or in\nNFU, because the pair is two types higher than its\nprojections in terms of TST. This means that functions and\nrelations are three types higher than the elements of their domains\nand ranges. There is a type-level pair defined by Quine (1945;\ntype-level because it is the same type as its projections) which is\ndefinable in NF and also on \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) for any infinite\nordinal \\(\\alpha\\); this pair can be defined and used in NF\nand the fact that it is definable on infinite \\(V_{\\alpha}\\) means\nthat it can be assumed in NFU+Infinity that there is a\ntype-level ordered pair (the existence of such a pair also follows\nfrom Infinity and Choice together). This would make the type\ndisplacement between functions and relations and elements of their\ndomains and ranges just one, the same as the displacement between the\ntypes of sets and their elements. We will assume that ordered pairs\nare of the same type as their projections in the sequel, but we will\nnot present the rather complicated definition of the Quine pair. \nOnce pairs are defined, the definition of relations and functions\nproceeds exactly as in the usual set theory. The definitions of\nintegers and rational numbers present no problem, and the Dedekind\nconstruction of the reals can be carried out as usual. We will focus\nhere on developing the solutions to the paradoxes of Cantor and\nBurali-Forti in NFU, which give a good picture of the odd\ncharacter of this set theory, and also set things up nicely for a\nbrief discussion of natural strong axioms of infinity for\nNFU. It is important to realize as we read the ways in which\nNFU evades the paradoxes that this evasion is successful:\nNFU is known to be consistent if the usual set theory is\nconsistent, and close examination of the models of NFU shows\nexactly why these apparent dodges work. \nTwo sets are said to be of the same cardinality just in case there is\na bijection between them. This is standard. But we then proceed to\ndefine \\(|A|\\) (the cardinality of a set \\(A)\\) as the set of all sets\nwhich are the same size as \\(A\\), realizing the definition intended by\nFrege and Russell, and apparently intended by Cantor as well. Notice\nthat \\(|A|\\) is one type higher than \\(A\\). The Frege natural numbers\nare the same objects as the finite cardinal numbers. \nThe Cantor theorem of the usual set theory asserts that \\(|A| \\lt\n|\\wp(A)|\\). This is clearly not true in NFU, since | \\(V|\\)\nis the cardinality of the universe and \\(|\\wp(V)|\\) is the cardinality\nof the set of sets, and in fact \\(|V| \\gt \\gt |\\wp(V)|\\) in all known\nmodels of NFU (there are many intervening cardinals in all\nsuch models). But \\(|A| \\lt |\\wp(A)|\\) does not make sense in\nTST: it is ill-typed. The correct theorem in TST,\nwhich is inherited by NFU, is \\(|\\wp_1 (A)| \\lt |\\wp(A)|\\),\nwhere \\(\\wp_1 (A)\\) is the set of one-element subsets of \\(A\\), which\nis at the same type as the power set of \\(A\\). So we have \\(|\\wp_1\n(V)| \\lt |\\wp(V)|\\): there are more sets than there are singleton\nsets. The apparent bijection \\(x \\mapsto \\{x\\}\\) between \\(\\wp_1 (V)\\)\nand \\(V\\) cannot be a set (and there is no reason to expect it to be a\nset, since it has an unstratified definition). \nA set which satisfies \\(|A| = |\\wp_1 (A)|\\) is called a\ncantorian set, since it satisfies the usual form of\nCantor’s theorem. A set \\(A\\) which satisfies the stronger\ncondition that the restriction of the singleton map to \\(A\\) is a set\nis said to be strongly cantorian (s.c.). Strongly cantorian\nsets are important because it is not necessary to assign a relative\ntype to a variable known to be restricted to a strongly cantorian set,\nas it is possible to use the restriction of the singleton map and its\ninverse to freely adjust the type of any such variable for purposes of\nstratification. The strongly cantorian sets are can be thought of as\nanalogues of the small sets of the usual set theory. \nOrdinal numbers are defined as equivalence classes of well-orderings\nunder similarity. There is a natural order on ordinal numbers, and in\nNFU as in the usual set theory it turns out to be a\nwell-ordering—and, as in naive set theory, a set! Since the\nnatural order on the ordinal numbers is a set, it has an order type\n\\(\\Omega\\) which is itself one of the ordinal numbers. Now in the\nusual set theory we prove that the order type of the restriction of\nthe natural order on the ordinals to the ordinals less than \\(\\alpha\\)\nis the ordinal \\(\\alpha\\) itself; however, this is an ill-typed\nstatement in TST, where, assuming a type level ordered pair,\nthe second occurrence of \\(\\alpha\\) is two types higher than the first\n(it would be four types higher if the Kuratowski ordered pair were\nused). Since the ordinals are isomorphism types of relations, we can\ndefine the operation \\(T\\) on them as above.  \nThe order type of the restriction of the natural order on the ordinals\nto the ordinals less than \\(\\alpha\\) is the ordinal \\(T^2 (\\alpha)\\)\n \nis an assertion which makes sense in TST and is in fact true\nin TST and so in NFU. We thus find that the order\ntype of the restriction of the natural order on the ordinals to the\nordinals less than \\(\\Omega\\) is \\(T^2 (\\Omega)\\), whence we find that\n\\(T^2 (\\Omega)\\) (as the order type of a proper initial segment of the\nordinals) is strictly less than \\(\\Omega\\) (which is the order type of\nall the ordinals). Once again, the fact that the singleton\nmap is not a function eliminates the “intuitively obvious”\nsimilarity between these orders. This also shows that \\(T\\) is not a\nfunction. \\(T\\) is an order endomorphism of the ordinals, though,\nwhence we have \\(\\Omega \\gt T^2 (\\Omega) \\gt T^4 (\\Omega)\\ldots\\),\nwhich may be vaguely disturbing, though this “sequence” is\nnot a set. A perhaps useful comment is that in the models of\nNFU described above, the action of \\(T\\) on ordinals exactly\nparallels the action of \\(j\\) on order types of well-orderings \\((j\\)\ndoes not send NFU ordinals to ordinals, exactly, so this\nneeds to be phrased carefully): the “descending sequence”\nalready has an analogue in the sequence \\(\\alpha \\gt j(\\alpha) \\gt j^2\n(\\alpha)\\ldots\\) in the original nonstandard model. Some have asserted\nthat this phenomenon (that the ordinals in any model of NFU\nare not externally well-ordered) can be phrased as “NFU\nhas no standard model”. We reserve judgement on this—we do\nnote that the theorem “the ordinals in any (set!) model of\nNFU are not well-ordered” is a theorem of NFU\nitself; note that NFU does not see the universe as a model of\nNFU (even though it is a set) because the membership relation\nis not a set relation (if it were, the singleton map certainly would\nbe). \nNFU + Infinity + Choice is a relatively weak theory: like\nZermelo set theory it does not prove even that \\(\\aleph_{\\omega}\\)\nexists. As is the case with Zermelo set theory, natural extensions of\nthis theory make it much stronger. We give just one example. The Axiom\nof Cantorian Sets is the deceptively simple statement (to which there\nare no evident counterexamples) that “every cantorian set is\nstrongly cantorian”. NFU + Infinity + Choice +\nCantorian Sets is a considerably stronger theory than NFU +\nInfinity + Choice: in its theory of isomorphism types of well-founded\nextensional relations with top element, the cantorian types with the\nobvious “membership” relation satisfy the axioms of\nZFC + “there is an \\(n\\)-Mahlo cardinal” for each\nconcrete \\(n\\). There is no mathematical need for the devious\ninterpretation: this theory proves the existence of \\(n\\)-Mahlo\ncardinals and supports all mathematical constructions at that level of\nconsistency strength in its own terms without any need to refer to the\ntheory of well-founded extensional relations. More elaborate\nstatements about such properties as “cantorian” and\n“strongly cantorian” (applied to order types as well as\ncardinality) yield even stronger axioms of infinity. \nOur basic claim about NFU + Infinity + Choice (and its\nextensions) is that it is a mathematically serviceable alternative set\ntheory with its own intrinsic motivation (although we have used\nZermelo style set theory to prove its consistency here, the entire\ndevelopment can be carried out in terms of TST alone: one can\nuse TST as meta-theory, show in TST that consistency\nof TST implies consistency of NFU, and use this\nresult to amend one’s meta-theory to NFU, thus\nabandoning the distinctions between types). We do not claim that it is\nbetter than ZFC, but we do claim that it is adequate, and\nthat it is important to know that adequate alternatives exist; we do\nclaim that it is useful to know that there are different ways to found\nmathematics, as we have encountered the absurd assertion that\n“mathematics is whatever is formalized in\nZFC”. \nLike Zermelo set theory, NFU has advantages and\ndisadvantages. An advantage, which corresponds to one of the few clear\ndisadvantages of Zermelo set theory, is that it is possible to define\nnatural numbers, cardinal numbers, and ordinal numbers in the natural\nway intended by Frege, Russell, and Whitehead. \nMany but not all of the purported disadvantages of NFU as a\nworking foundation for mathematics reduce to complaints by\nmathematicians used to working in ZFC that “this is not\nwhat we are used to”. The fact that there are fewer singletons\nthan objects (in spite of an obvious external one to one\ncorrespondence) takes getting used to. In otherwise familiar\nconstructions, one sometimes has to make technical use of the\nsingleton map or \\(T\\) operations to adjust types to get\nstratification. This author can testify that it is perfectly possible\nto develop good intuition for NFU and work effectively with\nstratified comprehension; part of this but not all of it is a good\nfamiliarity with how things are done in TST, as one also has\nto develop a feel for how to use principles that subvert\nstratification. \nAs Sol Feferman has pointed out, one place where the treatments in\nNFU (at least those given so far) are clearly quite involved\nare situations in which one needs to work with indexed families of\nobjects. The proof of König’s Lemma of set theory in Holmes\n1998 is a good example of how complicated this kind of thing can get\nin NFU. We have a notion that the use of sets of “Quine\natoms” (self-singletons) as index sets (necessarily for s.c.\nsets) might relieve this difficulty, but we haven’t proved this\nin practice, and problems would remain for the noncantorian\nsituation. \nThe fact that “NFU has no standard models” (the\nordinals are not well-ordered in any set model of NFU) is a\ncriticism of NFU which has merit. We observe, though, that\nthere are other set theories in which nonstandard objects are\ndeliberately provided (we will review some of these below), and some\nof the applications of those set theories to “nonstandard\nanalysis” might be duplicated in suitable versions of\nNFU. We also observe that strong principles which minimize\nthe nonstandard behavior of the ordinals turn out to give surprisingly\nstrong axioms of infinity in NFU; the nonstandard structure\nof the ordinals allows insight into phenomena associated with large\ncardinals. \nSome have thought that the fact that NFU combines a universal\nset and other big structures with mathematical fluency in treating\nthese structures might make it a suitable medium for category theory.\nAlthough we have some inclination to be partial to this class of set\ntheories, we note that there are strong counterarguments to this view.\nIt is true that there are big categories, such as the category of all\nsets (as objects) and functions (as the morphisms between them), the\ncategory of all topological spaces and homeomorphism, and even the\ncategory of all categories and functors. However, the category of all\nsets and functions, for example, while it is a set, is not\n“cartesian closed” (a technical property which this\ncategory is expected to have): see McLarty 1992. Moreover, if one\nrestricts to the s.c. sets and functions, one obtains a cartesian\nclosed category, which is much more closely analogous to the category\nof all sets and functions over ZFC—and shares with it\nthe disadvantage of being a proper class! Contemplation of the models\nonly confirms the impression that the correct analogue of the proper\nclass category of sets and functions in ZFC is the proper\nclass category of s.c. sets and functions in NFU! There may\nbe some applications for the big set categories in NFU, but\nthey are not likely to prove to be as useful as some have\noptimistically suggested. See Feferman 2006 for an extensive\ndiscussion. \nAn important point is that there is a relativity of viewpoint here:\nthe NFU world can be understood to be a nonstandard initial\nsegment of the world of ZFC (which could be arranged to\ninclude its entire standard part!) with an automorphism and the\nZFC world (or an initial segment of it) can be interpreted in\nNFU as the theory of isomorphism classes of well-founded\nextensional relations with top (often restricted to its strongly\ncantorian part); these two theories are mutually interpretable, so the\ncorresponding views of the world admit mutual translation. \nZFC might be viewed as motivated by a generalization of the\ntheory of sets in extension (as generalizations of the notion of\nfinite set, replacing the finite with the transfinite and the rejected\ninfinite with the rejected Absolute Infinite of Cantor) while the\nmotivation of NFU can be seen as a correction of the theory\nof sets as intensions (that is, as determined by predicates) which led\nto the disaster of naive set theory. Nino Cocchiarella (1985) has\nnoted that Frege’s theory of concepts could be saved if one\ncould motivate a restriction to stratified concepts (the abandonment\nof strong extensionality is merely a return to common sense). But the\nimpression of a fundamental contrast should be tempered by the\nobservation that the two theories nonetheless seem to be looking at\nthe same universe in different ways! \nWe will not attempt an exhaustive survey of positive set theory; our\naim here is to motivate and exhibit the axioms of the strongest system\nof this kind familiar to us, which is the third of the systems of\nclassical set theory which we regard as genuinely mathematically\nserviceable (the other two being ZFC and suitable strong\nextensions of NFU + Infinity + Choice). \nA positive formula is a formula which belongs to the smallest\nclass of formulas containing a false statement \\(\\bot\\), all atomic\nmembership and equality formulas and closed under the formation of\nconjunctions, disjunctions, universal and existential quantifications.\nA generalized positive formula is obtained if we allow\nbounded universal and existential quantifications (the\nadditional strength comes from allowing \\((\\forall x \\in A \\mid\n\\phi) \\equiv \\forall x(x \\in A \\rightarrow \\phi)\\); bounded\nexistential quantification is positive in any case). \nPositive comprehension is motivated superficially by an attack on one\nof the elements of Russell’s paradox (the negation): a positive\nset theory will be expected to support the axiom of extensionality (as\nusual) and the axiom of (generalized) positive comprehension:\nfor any (generalized) positive formula \\(\\phi , \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\)\nexists. \nWe mention that we are aware that positive comprehension with the\nadditional generalization of positive formulas allowing one to include\nset abstracts \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) (with \\(\\phi\\) generalized\npositive) in generalized positive formulas is consistent, but turns\nout not to be consistent with extensionality. We are not very familiar\nwith this theory, so have no additional comments to make about it; do\nnotice that the translations of formulas with set abstracts in them\ninto first order logic without abstracts are definitely not positive\nin our more restricted sense, and so one may expect some kind of\ntrouble! \nThe motivation for the kinds of positive set theory we are familiar\nwith is topological. We are to understand the sets as closed\nsets under some topology. Finite unions and intersections of closed\nsets are closed; this supports the inclusion of \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi\n\\lor \\psi \\}\\) and \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi \\amp \\psi \\}\\) as sets if \\(\\{x\n\\mid \\phi \\}\\) and \\(\\{x \\mid \\psi \\}\\) are sets. Arbitrary\nintersections of closed sets are closed: this supports our adoption of\neven bounded universal quantification (if each \\(\\{x \\mid\n\\phi(y)\\}\\) is a set, then \\(\\{x \\mid \\forall y\\phi(y)\\}\\) is the\nintersection of all of these sets, and so should be closed, and \\(\\{x\n\\in A \\mid \\forall y\\phi(y)\\}\\) is also an intersection of closed\nsets and so should be closed. The motivation for permitting \\(\\{x\n\\mid \\exists y\\phi(y)\\}\\) when each \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(y)\\}\\)\nexists is more subtle, since infinite unions do not as a rule preserve\nclosedness: the idea is that the set of pairs \\((x, y)\\) such that\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\) is closed, and the topology is such that the projection\nof a closed set is closed. Compactness of the topology suffices.\nMoreover, we now need to be aware that formulas with several\nparameters need to be considered in terms of a product topology. \nAn additional very powerful principle should be expected to hold in a\ntopological model: for any class \\(C\\) whatsoever (any collection of\nsets), the intersection of all sets which include \\(C\\) as a subclass\nshould be a set. Every class has a set closure. \nWe attempt the construction of a model of such a topological theory.\nTo bring out an analogy with Mac Lane set theory and NF, we\ninitially present a model built by collapsing TST in yet\nanother manner. \nThe model of TST that we use contains one type 0 object\n\\(u\\). Note that this means that each type is finite. Objects of each\ntype are construed as better and better approximations to the untyped\nobjects of the final set theory. \\(u\\) approximates any set. The type\n\\(n + 1\\) approximant to any set \\(A\\) is intended to be the set of\ntype \\(n\\) approximants of the elements of \\(A\\). \nThis means that we should be able to specify when a type \\(n + 2\\) set\n\\(A^{n+2}\\) refines a type \\(n + 1\\) set \\(A^{n+1}\\): each (type \\(n +\n1)\\) element of \\(A^{n+2}\\) should refine a (type \\(n)\\) element of\n\\(A^{n+1}\\), and each element of \\(A^{n+1}\\) should be refined by one\nor more elements of \\(A^{n+2}\\). Along with the information that the\ntype 0 object \\(u\\) refines both of the elements of type 1, this gives\na complete recursive definition of the notion of refinement of a type\n\\(n\\) set by a type \\(n + 1\\) set. Each type \\(n + 1\\) set refines a\nunique type \\(n\\) set but may be refined by many type \\(n + 2\\) sets.\n(The “hereditarily finite” sets without \\(u\\) in their\ntransitive closure are refined by just one precisely analogous set at\nthe next higher level.) Define a general relation \\(x \\sim y\\) on all\nelements of the model of set theory as holding when \\(x = y\\) (if they\nare of the same type) or if there is a chain of refinements leading\nfrom the one of \\(x, y\\) of lower type to the one of higher type. \nThe objects of our first model of positive set theory are sequences\n\\(s_n\\) with each \\(s_n\\) a type \\(n\\) set and with \\(s_{n+1}\\)\nrefining \\(s_n\\) for each \\(n\\). We say that \\(s \\in t\\) when \\(s_{n}\n\\in t_{n+1}\\) for all \\(n\\). It is straightforward to establish that\nif \\(s_{n} \\in t_{n+1}\\) or \\(s_{n} = t_{n}\\) is false, then \\(s_k \\in\nt_{k+1}\\) or (respectively) \\(s_k = t_k\\) is false for all \\(k \\gt\nn\\). More generally, if \\(s_m \\sim t_n\\) is false, then \\(s_{m+k} \\sim\nt_{n+k}\\) is false for all \\(k \\ge 0\\). \nFormulas in the language of the typed theory with \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\sim\\)\nhave a monotonicity property: if \\(\\phi\\) is a generalized positive\nformula and one of its typed versions is false, then any version of\nthe same formula obtained by raising types and refining the values of\nfree variables in the formula will continue to be false. It is not\nhard to see why this will fail to work if negation is allowed. \nIt is also not too hard to show that if all typed versions of a\ngeneralized positive formula \\(\\phi\\) in the language of the intended\nmodel (with sequences \\(s\\) appearing as values of free variables\nreplaced by their values at the appropriate types) are true, then the\noriginal formula \\(\\phi\\) is true in the intended model. The one\ndifficulty comes in with existential quantification: the fact that one\nhas a witness to \\((\\exists x.\\phi(x))\\) in each typed version does\nnot immediately give a sequence witnessing this in the intended model.\nThe tree property of \\(\\omega\\) helps here: only finitely many\napproximants to sets exist at each level, so one can at each level\nchoose an approximant refinements of which are used at infinitely many\nhigher levels as witnesses to \\((\\exists x.\\phi(x))\\), then restrict\nattention to refinements of that approximant; in this way one gets not\nan arbitrary sequence of witnesses at various types but a\n“convergent” sequence (an element of the intended\nmodel). \nOne then shows that any generalized positive formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) has\nan extension \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) by considering the sets of\nwitnesses to \\(\\phi(x)\\) in each type \\(n\\); these sets themselves can\nbe used to construct a convergent sequence (with the proviso that some\napparent elements found at any given stage may need to be discarded;\none defines \\(s_{n+1}\\) as the set of those type \\(n\\) approximants\nwhich not only witness \\(\\phi(x)\\) at the current type \\(n\\) but have\nrefinements which witness \\(\\phi(x)\\) at each subsequent type. The\nsequence of sets \\(s\\) obtained will be an element of the intended\nmodel and have the intended extension. \nFinally, for any class of sequences (elements of the intended model)\n\\(C\\), there is a smallest set which contains all elements of\n\\(C\\): let \\(c_{n+1}\\) be the set of terms \\(s_n\\) of sequences \\(s\\)\nbelonging to \\(C\\) at each type \\(n\\) to construct a sequence \\(c\\)\nwhich will have the desired property. \nThis theory can be made stronger by indicating how to pass to\ntransfinite typed approximations. The type \\(\\alpha + 1\\)\napproximation to a set will always be the set of type \\(\\alpha\\)\napproximations; if \\(\\lambda\\) is a limit ordinal, the type\n\\(\\lambda\\) approximation will be the sequence \\(\\{s_{\\beta} \\}_{\\beta\n\\lt \\lambda}\\) of approximants to the set at earlier levels (so our\n“intended model” above is the set of type \\(\\omega\\)\napproximations in a larger model). \nEverything above will work at any limit stage except the treatment of\nthe existential quantifier. The existential quantifier argument will\nwork if the ordinal stage at which the model is being constructed is a\nweakly compact cardinal. This is a moderately strong large cardinal\nproperty (for an uncountable cardinal): it implies, for example, the\nexistence of proper classes of inaccessibles and of \\(n\\)-Mahlo\ncardinals for each \\(n\\). \nSo for each weakly compact cardinal \\(\\kappa\\) (including \\(\\kappa =\n\\omega)\\) the approximants of level \\(\\kappa\\) in the transfinite type\ntheory just outlined make up a model of set theory with\nextensionality, generalized positive comprehension, and the closure\nproperty. We will refer to this model as the\n“\\(\\kappa\\)-hyperuniverse”. \nWe now present an axiomatic theory which has the\n\\(\\kappa\\)-hyperuniverses with \\(\\kappa \\gt \\omega\\) as (some of its)\nmodels. This is a first-order theory with equality and membership as\nprimitive relations. This system is called\nGPK\\(^{+}_{\\infty}\\) and is described in Esser 1999. \nExtensionality: Sets with the same elements are the\nsame. \nGeneralized Positive Comprehension: For any\ngeneralized positive formula \\(\\phi , \\{x \\mid \\phi \\}\\) exists.\n(Notice that since we view the false formula \\(\\bot\\) as positive we\nneed no special axiom asserting the existence of the empty set). \nClosure: For any formula \\(\\phi(x)\\), there is a set\n\\(C\\) such that \\(x \\in C \\equiv [\\forall y\\forall z(\\phi(z)\n\\rightarrow z \\in y) \\rightarrow x \\in y\\)]; \\(C\\) is the intersection\nof all sets which include all objects which satisfy \\(\\phi : C\\) is\ncalled the closure of the class \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\). \nInfinity: The closure of the von Neumann ordinals is\nnot an element of itself. (This excludes the \\(\\omega\\)-hyperuniverse,\nin which the closure of the class of von Neumann ordinals has itself\nas an additional member). \nAs one might expect, some of the basic concepts of this set theory are\ntopological (sets being the closed classes of the topology on the\nuniverse). \nThis set theory interprets ZF. This is shown by demonstrating\nfirst that the discrete sets (and more particularly the (closed) sets\nof isolated points in the topology) satisfy an analogue of Replacement\n(a definable function (defined by a formula which need not be\npositive) with a discrete domain is a set), and so an analogue of\nseparation, then by showing that well-founded sets are isolated in the\ntopology and the class of well-founded sets is closed under the\nconstructions of ZF. \nNot only ZF but also Kelley-Morse class theory can be\ninterpreted; any definable class of well-founded sets has a closure\nwhose well-founded members will be exactly the desired members (it\nwill as a rule have other, non-well-founded members). Quantification\nover these “classes” defines sets just as easily as\nquantification over mere sets in this context; so we get an\nimpredicative class theory. Further, one can prove internally to this\ntheory that the “proper class ordinal” in the interpreted\n\\(KM\\) has the tree property, and so is in effect a weakly compact\ncardinal; this shows that this theory has considerable consistency\nstrength (for example, its version of ZF proves that there is\na proper class of inaccessible cardinals, a proper class of\n\\(n\\)-Mahlos for each \\(n\\), and so forth): the use of large cardinals\nin the outlined model construction above was essential. \nThe Axiom of Choice in any global form is inconsistent with this\ntheory, but it is consistent for all well-founded sets to be\nwell-orderable (in fact, this will be true in the models described\nabove if the construction is carried out in an environment in which\nChoice is true). This is sufficient for the usual mathematical\napplications. \nSince ZF is entirely immersed in this theory, it is clearly\nserviceable for the usual classical applications. The Frege natural\nnumbers are not definable in this theory (except for 0 and 1); it is\nbetter to work with the finite von Neumann ordinals. The ability to\nprove strong results about large cardinals using the properties of the\nproper class ordinal suggests that the superstructure of large sets\ncan be used for mathematical purposes as well. Familiarity with\ntechniques of topology of \\(\\kappa\\)-compact spaces would be useful\nfor understanding what can be done with the big sets in this\ntheory. \nWith the negation of the Axiom of Infinity, we get the theory of the\n\\(\\omega\\)-hyperuniverse, which is equiconsistent with second-order\narithmetic, and so actually has a fair amount of mathematical\nstrength. In this theory, the class of natural numbers (considered as\nfinite ordinals) is not closed and acquires an extra element “at\ninfinity” (which happens to be the closure of the class of\nnatural numbers itself). Individual real numbers can be coded (using\nthe usual Dedekind construction, actually) but the theory of sets of\nreal numbers will begin to look quite different. \nOne obvious criticism is that this theory is extremely\nstrong, compared with the other systems given here. This could be a\ngood thing or a bad thing, depending on one’s attitude. If one\nis worried about the consistency of a weakly compact, the level of\nconsistency strength here is certainly a problem (though the theory of\nthe \\(\\omega\\) -hyperuniverse will stay around in any case). On the\nother hand, the fact that the topological motivation for set theory\nseems to work and yields a higher level of consistency strength than\none might expect (“weakly compact” infinity following from\nmerely uncountable infinity) might be taken as evidence that these are\nvery powerful ideas. \nThe mathematical constructions that are readily accessible to this\nauthor are simply carried over from ZF or ZFC; the\nwell-founded sets are considered within the world of positive set\ntheory, and we find that they have exactly the properties we expect\nthem to have from the usual viewpoint. It is rather nice that we get\n(fuzzier) objects in our set theory suitable to represent all of the\nusual proper classes; it is less clear what we can do with the other\nlarge objects than it is in NFU. A topologist might find this\nsystem quite interesting; in any event, topological expertise seems\nrequired to evaluate what can be done with the extra machinery in this\nsystem. \nWe briefly review the paradoxes: the Russell paradox doesn’t\nwork because \\(x \\not\\in x\\) is not a positive formula; notice that\n\\(\\{x \\mid x \\in x\\}\\) exists! The Cantor paradox does not work\nbecause the proof of the Cantor theorem relies on an instance of\ncomprehension which is not positive. \\(\\wp(V)\\) does exist and is\nequal to \\(V\\). The ordinals are defined by a non-positive condition,\nand do not make up a set, but it is interesting to note that the\nclosure \\(\\mathbf{CL}(On)\\) of the class \\(On\\) of ordinals is equal\nto \\(On \\cup \\{\\mathbf{CL}(On)\\}\\); the closure has itself as its only\nunexpected element. \nIn the preceding set theories, the properties of the usual objects of\nmathematics accord closely with their properties as\n“intuitively” understood by most mathematicians (or lay\npeople). (Strictly speaking, this is not quite true in NFU +\nInfinity without the additional assumption of Rosser’s Axiom of\nCounting, but the latter axiom (“\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is strongly\ncantorian”) is almost always assumed in practice). \nIn the first two classes of system discussed in this section, logical\nconsiderations lead to the construction of theories in which\n“familiar” parts of the world look quite different.\nConstructive mathematicians do not see the same continuum that we do,\nand if they are willing to venture into the higher reaches of set\ntheory, they find a different world there, too. The proponents of\nnonstandard analysis also find it useful to look at a different\ncontinuum (and even different natural numbers) though they do see the\nusual continuum and natural numbers embedded therein. \nIt is not entirely clear that the final item discussed in this\nsection, the multiverse view of set theory proposed by Joel Hamkins,\nshould be described as a view of the world of set theory at all: it\nproposes that we should consider that there are multiple different\nconcepts of set each of which describes its own universe (and loosely\nwe might speak of the complex of universes as a\n“multiverse”), but at bottom it is being questioned whether\nthere is properly a single world of set theory at all. But the\ntentative list of proposed axioms he gives for relationships between\nuniverses have some of the flavor of an alternative set theory. \nThere are a number of attempts at constructive (intuitionistic)\ntheories of types and set theories. We will describe a few systems\nhere, quite briefly as we are not expert in constructive\nmathematics. \nAn intuitionistic typed theory of sets is readily obtained by simply\nadopting the intuitionistic versions of the axioms of TST as\naxioms. An Axiom of Infinity would be wanted to ensure that an\ninterpretation of Heyting arithmetic could be embedded\nin the theory; it might be simplest to provide type 0 with the\nprimitives of Heyting arithmetic (just as the earliest versions of\nTST had the primitives of classical arithmetic provided for\ntype 0). We believe that this would give a quite comfortable\nenvironment for doing constructive mathematics. \nDaniel Dzierzgowski has gone so far as to study an intuitionistic\nversion of NF constructed in the same way; all that we can\nusefully report here is that it is not clear that the resulting theory\nINF is as strong as NF (in particular, it is unclear\nwhether INF interprets Heyting Arithmetic, because\nSpecker’s proof of Infinity in NF does not seem to go\nthrough in any useful way) but the consistency problem for\nINF remains open in spite of the apparent weakness of the\ntheory. \nA more ambitious theory is IZF (intuitionistic ZF).\nAn interesting feature of the development of IZF is that one\nmust be very careful in one’s choice of axioms: some\nformulations of the axioms of set theory have (constructively\ndeducible) consequences which are not considered constructively valid\n(such as Excluded Middle), while other (classically equivalent)\nformulations of the axioms appear not to have such consequences: the\nlatter forms, obviously to be preferred for a constructive development\nof set theory, often are not the most familiar ones in the classical\ncontext. \nA set of axioms which seems to yield a nontrivial system of\nconstructive mathematics is the following: \nExtensionality: in the usual ZF form. \nPairing, Union, Power Set, Infinity: in the usual\nZF form. \nCollection: We are not sure why this is often\npreferred in constructive set theory, as it seems to us less\nconstructive than replacement? But we have heard it said that\nReplacement is constructively quite weak. \n\\(\\in\\)-Induction: The induction on membership form\nis preferred for a highly practical reason: more usual formulations of\nFoundation immediately imply the Axiom of Excluded Middle! \nSee Friedman 1973 and\n Other Internet Resources\n for further information about IZF. \nAs is often the case in constructive mathematics generally, very\nsimple notions of classical set theory (such as the notion of an\nordinal) require careful reformulation to obtain the appropriate\ndefinition for the constructive environment (and the formulations\noften appear more complicated than familiar ones to the classical\neye). Being inexpert, we will not involve ourselves further in this.\nIt is worth noting that IZF, like many but not all\nconstructive systems, admits a double negation interpretation of the\ncorresponding classical theory ZF; we might think of\nIZF as a weakened version of ZF from the classical\nstandpoint, but in its own terms it is the theory of a larger, more\ncomplex realm in which a copy of the classical universe of set theory\nis embedded. \nThe theories we have described so far are criticized by some\nconstructive mathematicians for allowing an unrestricted power set\noperation. A weaker system CZF (constructive ZF has been proposed which does\nnot have this operation (and which has the same level of strength as\nthe weak set theory KPU without Power Set described\nearlier). \nCZF omits Power Set. It replaces Foundation with\n\\(\\in\\)-Induction for the same reasons as above. The axioms of\nExtensionality, Pairing, and Union are as in ordinary set theory. The\naxiom of Separation is restricted to bounded \\((\\Delta_0)\\) formulas\nas in Mac Lane set theory or KPU. \nThe Collection axiom is replaced by two weaker axioms. \nThe Strong Collection axiom scheme asserts that if for every \\(x \\in\nA\\) there is \\(y\\) such that \\(\\phi (x, y)\\), then there is a set\n\\(B\\) such that for every \\(x \\in A\\) there is \\(y \\in B\\) such that\n\\(\\phi(x, y)\\) (as in the usual scheme) but also for every \\(y \\in B\\)\nthere is \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) (\\(B\\) doesn’t contain\nany redundant elements). The additional restriction is useful because\nof the weaker form of the Separation Axiom. \nThe Subset Collection scheme can be regarded as containing a very weak\nform of Power Set. It asserts, for each formula \\(\\phi(x, y, z)\\) that\nfor every \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there is a set \\(C\\) such that for each\n\\(z\\) such that \\(\\forall x \\in A\\exists y \\in B[\\phi(x, y, z)\\)]\nthere is \\(R_z \\in C\\) such that for every \\(x \\in A\\) there is \\(y\n\\in R_z\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y, z)\\) and for every \\(y \\in\nR_z\\) there is \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(\\phi(x, y, z)\\) (this is the\nsame restriction as in the Strong Collection axiom; notice that not\nonly are images under the relation constructed, but the images are\nfurther collected into a set). \nThe Subset Collection scheme is powerful enough to allow the\nconstruction of the set of all functions from a set \\(A\\) to a set\n\\(B\\) as a set (which suggests that the classical version of this\ntheory is as strong as ZF, since the existence of the set of\nfunctions from \\(A\\) to \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\) is classically as strong as the\nexistence of the power set of \\(A\\), and strong collection should\nallow the proof of strong separation in a classical environment). \nThis theory is known to be at the same level of consistency strength\nas the classical set theory KPU. It admits an interpretation\nin Martin-Löf constructive type theory (as IZF does\nnot). \nSee Aczel (1978, 1982, 1986) for further information about this\ntheory. \nNonstandard analysis originated with Abraham Robinson (1966), who\nnoticed that the use of nonstandard models of the continuum would\nallow one to make sense of the infinitesimal numbers of Leibniz, and\nso obtain an elegant formulation of the calculus with fewer\nalternations of quantifiers. \nLater exponents of nonstandard analysis observed that the constant\nreference to the model theory made the exposition less elementary than\nit could be; they had the idea of working in a set theory which was\ninherently “nonstandard”. \nWe present a system of this kind, a version of the set theory\nIST (Internal Set Theory) of Nelson (1977). The primitives of the theory are\nequality, membership, and a primitive notion of standardness.\nThe axioms follow. \nExtensionality, Pairing, Union, Power Set, Foundation,\nChoice: As in our presentation of ZFC above. \nSeparation, Replacement: As in our presentation of\nZFC above, except that the standardness predicate cannot\nappear in the formula \\(\\phi\\). \nDefinition: For any formula \\(\\phi\\), the formula\n\\(\\phi\\)st is obtained by replacing each quantifier over\nthe universe with a quantifier over all standard objects (and each\nquantifier bounded in a set with a quantifier restricted to the\nstandard elements of that set). \nIdealization: There is a finite set which contains\nall standard sets. \nTransfer: For each formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) not mentioning\nthe standardness predicate and containing no parameters (free\nvariables other than \\(x)\\) except standard sets, \\(\\forall x\\phi(x)\n\\equiv \\forall x\\)(standard\\((x) \\rightarrow \\phi(x))\\). \nStandardization: For any formula \\(\\phi(x)\\) and\nstandard set \\(A\\), there is a standard set \\(B\\) whose standard\nelements are exactly the standard elements \\(x\\) of \\(A\\) satisfying\n\\(\\phi(x)\\). \nOur form of Idealization is simpler than the usual version but has the\nsame effect. \nTransfer immediately implies that any uniquely definable object\n(defined without reference to standardness) is in fact a standard\nobject. So the empty set is standard, \\(\\omega\\) is standard, and so\nforth. But it is not the case that all elements of standard objects\nare standard. For consider the cardinality of a finite set containing\nall standard objects; this is clearly greater that any standard\nnatural number (usual element of \\(\\omega)\\) yet it is equally clearly\nan element of \\(\\omega\\). It turns out to be provable that every set\nall of whose elements are standard is a standard finite set. \nRelative consistency of this theory with the usual set theory\nZFC is established via familiar results of model theory.\nWorking in this theory makes it possible to use the techniques of\nnonstandard analysis in a “elementary” way, without ever\nappealing explicitly to the properties of nonstandard models. \nWe examine the theory of the set theoretic multiverse proposed by Joel\nDavid Hamkins, whose purpose is to address philosophical questions\nabout independence questions in standard set theory, but which when\nspelled out formally has some of the flavor of an alternative set\ntheory. A set theoretic Platonist might say about the Continuum\nHypothesis (CH) that, since there is “of course”\na single universe of sets, CH is either true or false in that\nworld, but that we cannot determine which of CH and\n\\(\\neg\\)CH actually holds. Hamkins proposes as an alternative\n(taking the same realist standpoint as the classical Platonist, it\nmust be noted) that there are many distinct concepts of set, which we\nmay suppose for the moment all satisfy the usual axioms of\nZFC, each concept determining its own universe of sets, and\nin some of these universes CH holds and in some it does not\nhold. He says further, provocatively, that in his view CH is\na solved problem, because we have an excellent understanding of the\nconditions under which CH holds in \\(a\\) universe of sets\n(note the article used) and the conditions in which it does not hold,\nand even more provocatively, he argues that an “ideal”\nsolution to the CH problem in which a generally accepted\naxiom arises which causes most mathematicians to conclude that\nCH is “self-evidently” true or false (deciding\nthe question in the usual sense) is now actually impossible, because\nset theorists are now very conversant with universes in which both\nalternatives hold, and understand very well that neither alternative\nis “self-evidently” true (the force of his argument is\nreally that the complementary conclusion that one of the alternatives\nis self-evidently false is now impossible to draw, because we are too\nwell acquainted with actual “worlds” in which each\nalternative holds to believe that either is absurd). \nWe could write an entire essay on questions raised in our summary in\nthe previous paragraph, but Hamkins has already done this in Hamkins\n2012. Our aim here is to summarize the tentative axioms that Hamkins\npresents for the multiverse conception. This is not really a formal\nset of axioms, but it does have some of the qualities of an\naxiomatization of an alternative set theory. We note that the list of\naxioms presented here unavoidably presupposes more knowledge of\nadvanced set theory than other parts of this article. \nRealizability Principle: For any universe \\(V\\), if\n\\(W\\) is a model of set theory and definable or interpreted in \\(V\\),\nthen \\(W\\) is a universe. \nOne thing to note here is that Hamkins is open to the idea that some\nuniverses may be models of theories other than ZFC (weaker\ntheories such as Zermelo set theory or Peano arithmetic, or even\ndifferent theories such as ZFA or NF/NFU).\nBut it appears to be difficult philosophically to articulate exact\nboundaries for what counts as a “concept of set theory”\nwhich would define a universe. And this is fine, because there is no\nnotion of “the multiverse” of universes as a completed\ntotality here at all—this would amount to smuggling in the\nsingle Platonic universe again through the back door! Some of the\naxioms which follow do presume that the universes discussed are models\nof ZFC or very similar theories. \nForcing Extension Principle: For any universe \\(V\\)\nand any forcing notion \\(P\\) in \\(V\\), there is a forcing extension\n\\(V[G]\\), where \\(G \\subset P\\) is \\(V\\)-generic. \nThis asserts that our forcing extensions are concretely real worlds.\nHamkins discusses the metaphysical difficulties of the status of\nforcing extensions at length in Hamkins 2012. \nReflection Axiom: For every universe \\(V\\), there is\na much taller universe \\(W\\) with an ordinal \\(\\theta\\) for which\n\\(V\\) is elementarily equivalent to (or isomorphic to) \\(W_{\\theta}\\),\na level of the cumulative hierarchy in \\(W\\). \nWe quote Hamkins:  \nthe principle asserts that no universe is correct about the height of\nthe ordinals, and every universe looks like an initial segment of a\nmuch taller universe having the same truths. (2012: 438)  \nHere we are presuming that the universes we are talking about are\nmodels of ZFC or a ZFC-like theory. \nCountability Principle: Every universe \\(V\\) is\ncountable from the perspective of another, better universe \\(W\\). \nThis definitely has the flavor of an alternative set theory axiom! The\nmodel theoretic motivation is obvious: this amounts to taking\nSkolem’s paradox seriously. Hamkins notes that the Forcing\nExtension principle above already implies this, but it is clear in any\ncase that his list of tentative axioms is intended to be neither\nindependent nor complete. \n Well-foundedness Mirage: Every universe \\(V\\) is\nill-founded from the perspective of another, better universe. \nHamkins says that this may be the most provocative of all his axioms.\nHe states that he intends this to imply that even our notion of\nnatural numbers is defective in any universe: the collection of\nnatural numbers as defined in any universe is seen to contain\nnonstandard elements from the standpoint of a further universe. \nReverse Embedding Axiom: For every universe \\(V\\) and\nevery embedding \\(j : V \\rightarrow M\\) in \\(V\\), there is a universe\n\\(W\\) and embedding \\(h: W \\rightarrow V\\) such that \\(j\\) is the\niterate of \\(h\\). \nWe merely quote this astonishing assertion, which says that for any\nelementary embedding of a universe \\(V\\) into a model \\(M\\) included\nin \\(V\\), our understanding of this embedding locally to \\(V\\) itself\nis seriously incomplete. \nAbsorption into L: Every universe \\(V\\) is a\ncountable transitive model in another universe \\(W\\) satisfying \\(V =\nL\\). \nWe are used to thinking of the constructible universe \\(L\\) as a\n“restricted” universe. Here Hamkins turns this inside out\n(he discusses at length why this is a reasonable way to think in the\npaper Hamkins 2012). \nWe leave it to the reader who is interested to pursue this\nfurther. \nIt is commonly noted that set theory produces far more superstructure\nthan is needed to support classical mathematics. In this section, we\ndescribe two miniature theories which purport to provide enough\nfoundations without nearly as much superstructure. Our “pocket\nset theory” (motivated by a suggestion of Rudy Rucker) is just\nsmall; Vopenka’s alternative set theory is also\n“nonstandard” in its approach. \nThis theory is a proposal of ours, which elaborates on a suggestion of\nRudy Rucker. We (and many others) have observed that of all the orders\nof infinity in Cantor’s paradise, only two actually occur in\nclassical mathematical practice outside set theory: these are\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) and \\(c\\), the infinity of the natural numbers and the\ninfinity of the continuum. Pocket set theory is a theory motivated by\nthe idea that these are the only infinities (Vopenka’s\nalternative set theory also has this property, by the way). \nThe objects of pocket set theory are classes. A class is said to be a\nset iff it is an element (as in the usual class theories over\nZFC). \nThe ordered pair is defined using the usual Kuratowski definition, but\nwithout assuming that there are any ordered pairs. The notions of\nrelation, function, bijection and equinumerousness are defined as\nusual (still without any assumptions as to the existence of any\nordered pairs). An infinite set is defined as a set which is\nequinumerous with one of its proper subsets. A proper class is defined\nas a class which is not a set. \nThe axioms of pocket set theory are \nExtensionality: Classes with the same elements are\nequal. \nClass Comprehension: For any formula \\(\\phi\\), there\nis a class \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi(x)\\}\\) which contains all sets \\(x\\)\nsuch that \\(\\phi(x)\\). (note that this is the class comprehension\naxiom of Kelley-Morse set theory, without any restrictions on\nquantifiers in \\(\\phi)\\). \nInfinite Sets: There is an infinite set; all infinite\nsets are the same size. \nProper Classes: All proper classes are the same size,\nand any class the same size as a proper class is proper. \nWe cannot resist proving the main results (because the proofs are\nfunny). \nEmpty Set: If the empty set were a proper class, then\nall proper classes would be empty. In particular, the Russell class\nwould be empty. Let \\(I\\) be an infinite set. \\(\\{I\\}\\) would be a\nset, because it is not empty, and \\(\\{I,\\{I\\}\\}\\) would be a set\n(again because it is not empty). But \\(\\{I,\\{I\\}\\}\\) belongs to the\nRussell class (as a set with two elements, it cannot be either the\nDedekind infinite \\(I\\) or the singleton \\(\\{I\\}\\). So \\(\\varnothing\\)\nis a set. \nSingleton: If any singleton \\(\\{x\\}\\) is a proper\nclass, then all singletons are proper classes, and the Russell class\nis a singleton. \\(\\{I, \\varnothing \\}\\) is a set (both elements are\nsets, and the class is not a singleton) which cannot be a member of\nitself, and so is in the Russell class. But so is \\(\\varnothing\\) in\nthe Russell class; so the Russell class is not a singleton, and all\nsingletons are sets. \nUnordered Pair: The Russell class is not a pair,\nbecause it has distinct elements \\(\\varnothing , \\{\\varnothing \\},\n\\{\\{\\varnothing \\}\\}\\). \nRelations: All Kuratowski ordered pairs exist, so all\ndefinable relations are realized as set relations. \nCantor’s theorem (no set is the same size as the class of its\nsubsets) and the Schröder-Bernstein theorem (if there are\ninjections from each of two classes into the other, there is a\nbijection between them) have their standard proofs. \nThe Russell class can be shown to be the same size as the universe\nusing Schröder-Bernstein: the injection from \\(R\\) into \\(V\\) is\nobvious, and \\(V\\) can be embedded into \\(R\\) using the map \\(x\n\\mapsto \\{\\{x\\}, \\varnothing \\}\\) (clearly no set \\(\\{\\{x\\},\n\\varnothing \\}\\) belongs to itself). So a class is proper iff it is\nthe same size as the universe (limitation of size). \nDefine the von Neumann ordinals as classes which are strictly\nwell-ordered by membership. Each finite ordinal can be proved to be a\nset (because it is smaller than its successor and is a subclass of the\nRussell class). The class of all ordinals is not a set (but is the\nlast ordinal), for the usual reasons, and so is the same size as the\nuniverse, and so the universe can be well-ordered. \nThere is an infinite ordinal, because there is an ordinal which can be\nplaced in one-to-one correspondence with one’s favorite infinite\nset \\(I\\). Since there is an infinite ordinal, every finite ordinal is\na set and the first infinite ordinal \\(\\omega\\) is a set. It follows\nthat all infinite sets are countably infinite. \nThe power set of an infinite set \\(I\\) is not the same size as \\(I\\)\nby Cantor’s theorem, is certainly infinite, and so cannot be a\nset, and so must be the same size as the universe. It follows by usual\nconsiderations that the universe is the same size as \\(\\wp(\\omega)\\)\nor as \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) (the set of real numbers, defined in any of the\nusual ways), and its “cardinal” is \\(c\\). Further, the\nfirst uncountable ordinal \\(\\omega_1\\) is the cardinality of the\nuniverse, so the Continuum Hypothesis holds. \nIt is well-known that coding tricks allow one to do classical\nmathematics without ever going above cardinality \\(c\\): for example,\nthe class of all functions from the reals to the reals, is\ntoo large to be even a proper class here, but the class of\ncontinuous functions is of cardinality \\(c\\). An individual\ncontinuous function \\(f\\) might seem to be a proper class, but it can\nbe coded as a hereditarily countable set by (for example) letting the\ncountable set of pairs of rationals \\(\\langle p, q\\rangle\\) such that\n\\(p \\lt f(q)\\) code the function \\(f\\). In fact, it is claimed that\nmost of classical mathematics can be carried out using just natural\nnumbers and sets of natural numbers (second-order arithmetic) or in\neven weaker systems, so pocket set theory (having the strength of\nthird order arithmetic) can be thought to be rather\ngenerous. \nWe do remark that it is not necessarily the case that the hypothetical\nadvocate of pocket set theory thinks that the universe is small; he or\nshe might instead think that the continuum is very large… \nPetr Vopenka has presented the following alternative set\ntheory (1979). \nThe theory has sets and classes. The following axioms hold of\nsets. \nExtensionality: Sets with the same elements are the\nsame. \nEmpty set: \\(\\varnothing\\) exists. \nSuccessor: For any sets \\(x\\) and \\(y, x \\cup \\{y\\}\\)\nexists. \nInduction: Every formula \\(\\phi\\) expressed in the\nlanguage of sets only (all parameters are sets and all quantifiers are\nrestricted to sets) and true of \\(\\varnothing\\) and true of \\(x \\cup\n\\{y\\}\\) if it is true of \\(x\\) is true of all sets. \nRegularity: Every set has an element disjoint from\nit. \nThe theory of sets appears to be the theory of \\(V_{\\omega}\\) (the\nhereditarily finite sets) in the usual set theory! \nWe now pass to consideration of classes. \nExistence of classes: If \\(\\phi(x)\\) is any formula,\nthen the class \\(\\phi(x)\\) of all sets \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi(x)\\)\nexists. (The set \\(x\\) is identified with the class of elements of\n\\(x\\).) Note that Kuratowski pairs of sets are sets, and so we can\ndefine (class) relations and functions on the universe of sets much as\nusual. \nExtensionality for classes: Classes with the same\nelements are equal. \nDefinition: A semiset is a subclass of a\nset. A proper class is a class which is not a set. A\nproper semiset is a subclass of a set which is not a set. \nAxiom of proper semisets: There is a proper\nsemiset. \nA proper semiset is a signal that the set which contains it is\nnonstandard (recall that all sets seem to be hereditarily\nfinite!) \nDefinition: A set is finite iff all of its\nsubclasses are sets. \nA finite set has standard size (the use of “finite” here\ncould be confusing: all sets are nonstandard finite here,\nafter all). \nDefinition: An ordering of type \\(\\omega\\) is a class\nwell-ordering which is infinite and all of whose initial segments are\nfinite. A class is countable if it has an ordering of type\n\\(\\omega\\). \nAn ordering of type \\(\\omega\\) has the same length as the\nstandard natural numbers. We can prove that there is such an\nordering: consider the order on the finite (i.e., standard finite) von\nNeumann ordinals. There must be infinite von Neumann ordinals because\nthere is a set theoretically definable bijection between the von\nNeumann ordinals and the whole universe of sets: any proper semiset\ncan be converted to a proper semiset of a set of von Neumann\nordinals. \nProlongation axiom: Each countable function \\(F\\) can\nbe extended to a set function. \nThe Prolongation Axiom has a role similar to that of the\nStandardization Axiom in the “nonstandard” set theory\nIST above. \nVopenka considers representations of superclasses of classes using\nrelations on sets. A class relation \\(R\\) on a class \\(A\\) is said to\ncode the superclass of inverse images of elements of \\(A\\) under\n\\(R\\). A class relation \\(R\\) on a class \\(A\\) is said to\nextensionally code this superclass if distinct elements of \\(A\\) have\ndistinct preimages. He “tidies up” the theory of such\ncodings by adopting the \nAxiom of extensional coding: Every collection of\nclasses which is codable is extensionally codable. \nIt is worth noting that this can be phrased in a way which makes no\nreference to superclasses: for any class relation \\(R\\), there is a\nclass relation \\(R'\\) such that for any \\(x\\) there is \\(x'\\) with\npreimage under \\(R'\\) equal to the preimage of \\(x\\) under \\(R\\), and\ndistinct elements of the field of \\(R'\\) have distinct preimages. \nHis notion of coding is more general: we can further code collections\nof classes by taking a pair \\(\\langle K, R\\rangle\\) where \\(K\\) is a\nsubclass of the field of \\(R\\); clearly any collection of classes\ncodable in this way can be extensionally coded by using the axiom in\nthe form we give. \nThe final axiom is \nAxiom of cardinalities: If two classes are\nuncountable, they are the same size. \nThis implies (as in pocket set theory) that there are two infinite\ncardinalities, which can be thought of as \\(\\aleph_0\\) and \\(c\\),\nthough in this context their behavior is less familiar than it is in\npocket set theory. For example, the set of all natural numbers (as\nVopenka defines it) is of cardinality \\(c\\), while there is an initial\nsegment of the natural numbers (the finite natural numbers) which has\nthe expected cardinality \\(\\omega\\). \nOne gets the axiom of choice from the axioms of cardinalities and\nextensional codings; the details are technical. One might think that\nthis would go as in pocket set theory: the order type of all the\nordinals is not a set and so has the same cardinality as the universe.\nBut this doesn’t work here, because the “ordinals”\nin the obvious sense are all nonstandard finite ordinals, which, from\na class standpoint, are not well-ordered at all. However, there is a\ndevious way to code an uncountable well-ordering using the axiom of\nextensional coding, and since its domain is uncountable it must be the\nsame size as the universe. \nThis is a rather difficult theory. A model of the alternative set\ntheory in the usual set theory is a nonstandard model of\n\\(V_{\\omega}\\) of size \\(\\omega_1\\) in which every countable external\nfunction extends to a function in the model. It might be best to\nsuppose that this model is constructed inside \\(L\\) (the constructible\nuniverse) so that the axiom of cardinalities will be satisfied. The\naxiom of extensional coding follows from Choice in the ambient set\ntheory. \nThe constructions of the natural numbers and the real numbers with\nwhich we started go much as usual, except that we get two kinds of\nnatural numbers (the finite von Neumann ordinals in the set universe\n(nonstandard), and the finite von Neumann set ordinals\n(standard)). The classical reals can be defined as Dedekind cuts in\nthe standard rationals; these are not sets, but any real can then be\napproximated by a nonstandard rational. One can proceed to do analysis\nwith some (but not quite all) of the tools of the usual nonstandard\nanalysis. \nA recent proposal of Andrzej Kisielewicz (1998) is that the paradoxes\nof set theory might be evaded by having two different membership\nrelations \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\), with each membership relation\nused to define extensions for the other. \nWe present the axiomatics. The primitive notions of this theory are\nequality \\((=)\\) and the two flavors \\(\\in\\) and \\(\\varepsilon\\) of\nmembership. A formula \\(\\phi\\) is uniform if it does not\nmention \\(\\varepsilon\\). If \\(\\phi\\) is a uniform formula, \\(\\phi^*\\)\nis the corresponding formula with \\(\\in\\) replaced by \\(\\varepsilon\\)\nthroughout. \nA set \\(A\\) is regular iff it has the same extension with\nrespect to both membership relations: \\(x \\in A \\equiv x \\varepsilon\nA\\). \nThe comprehension axiom asserts that for any uniform formula \\(\\phi\n(x)\\) in which all parameters (free variables other than \\(x)\\) are\nregular, there is an object \\(\\{x \\mid \\phi (x)\\}\\) such that\n\\(\\forall x(x \\in A \\equiv \\phi^* \\amp x \\varepsilon A \\equiv\n\\phi)\\). \nThe extensionality axiom asserts that for any \\(A\\) and \\(B, \\forall\nx(x \\in A \\equiv x \\varepsilon B) \\rightarrow A = B\\). Notice that any\nobject to which this axiom applies is regular. \nFinally, a special axiom asserts that any set one of whose extensions\nis included in a regular set is itself regular. \nThis theory can be shown to interpret ZF in the realm of\nhereditarily regular sets. Formally, the proof has the same\nstructure as the proof for Ackermann set theory. It is unclear whether\nthis theory is actually consistent; natural ways to strengthen it\n(including the first version proposed by Kisielewicz) turn out to be\ninconsistent. It is also extremely hard to think about! \nAn example of the curious properties of this theory is that the\nordinals under one membership relation are exactly the regular\nordinals while under the other they are longer; this means that the\napparent symmetry between the two membership relations breaks! \nWe have presented a wide range of theories here. The theories\nmotivated by essentially different views of the realm of mathematics\n(the constructive theories and the theories which support nonstandard\nanalysis) we set to one side. Similarly, the theories motivated by the\ndesire to keep the universe small can be set to one side. The\nalternative classical set theories which support a fluent development\nof mathematics seem to be ZFC or its variants with classes\n(including Ackermann), NFU + Infinity + Choice with suitable\nstrong infinity axioms (to get s.c. sets to behave nicely), and the\npositive set theory of Esser. Any of these is adequate for the\npurpose, in our opinion, including the one currently in use. There is\nno compelling reason for mathematicians to use a different foundation\nthan ZFC; but there is a good reason for mathematicians who\nhave occasion to think about foundations to be aware that there are\nalternatives; otherwise there is a danger that accidental features of\nthe dominant system of set theory will be mistaken for essential\nfeatures of any foundation of mathematics. For example, it is\nfrequently said that the universal set (an extension which is actually\ntrivially easy to obtain in a weak set theory) is an inconsistent\ntotality; the actual situation is merely that one cannot have a\nuniversal set while assuming Zermelo’s axiom of separation.","contact.mail":"holmes@math.boisestate.edu","contact.domain":"math.boisestate.edu"}]
