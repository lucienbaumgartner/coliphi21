Do all works of art belong to a\nsingle category of entities?  Do they have multiple instances? Do\nworks have parts or constituents, and if so, what is their relation to\nthe work as a whole? How are works of art individuated? Are they\ncreated or discovered?  Can they be destroyed?\n\n\n\nExplicit and extensive treatments of these topics written\nprior to the 19th century have yet to be found. This does\nnot mean, however, that there is nothing relevant to these ontological\nquestions in early writings on beauty, the arts, and related\nmatters. For example, Aristotle’s claims about the functions and\nelements of tragedy (see Gerald Else 1957) can be mined for ideas\nabout the nature of literary and dramatic works more generally. And\nwhat can be made of the hint, in Metaphysics Eta, 6, that the\nunity of The Iliad is a matter of a set of words made\n“one” by being connected together?\n\n\n\nRather than attempting to make conjectures about such difficult\nexegetical topics, this entry focuses primarily on contributions made\nby authors who explicitly address themselves at length to some of the\naforementioned questions pertaining directly to the ontology of works\nof art, either in general or with reference to such major art forms as\nmusic, literature, painting, architecture, and sculpture.\n\n\n\nOne further note about the scope of this entry is in\norder. Instructive surveys of the subfield of aesthetics known as the\nontology of art are fairly plentiful; see Nicholas Wolterstorff\n(1992), Gregory Currie (1998, 2010), Joseph Margolis (1998), Stephen\nDavies (2003a), Amie Thomasson (2004, 2006b), Guy Rohrbaugh (2005),\nTheodore Gracyk (2009), Robert Stecker (2010), and Carl Matheson and\nBen Caplan (2011). Surveys of the history of the field have\nnot, however, been forthcoming, and the comments on this topic that\ncrop up in the literature are sketchy and sometimes quite\nmisleading. One shortcoming has been a marked tendency to focus on\nvery recent contributions, the one salient exception being due\nattention paid to works by Roman Ingarden (e.g., 1931, 1962, and see\nthe entry on Ingarden). Accordingly, the present entry focuses\nprimarily on contributions made in the 19th and\n20th centuries and the first decade of the 21st. \n\n\n\nAlthough artists, critics, and art lovers are likely to think it\nabsurd to deny that a work of art is as real as anything else one\nmight encounter, many philosophers and art theorists have raised\nquestions about the very existence or “mode of being” of\nworks of art. \n\nOne prevalent response to the question of art’s existence is a\nstraightforward realism to the effect that works of art figure amongst\nthose entities that, once they have been brought into existence, do\nnot depend on anyone’s (actual or possible) beliefs or\nresponses. Assuming that something can only be discovered if it\nalready exists, a striking example of a realist statement is Samuel\nAlexander’s claim that “Shakespeare\ndiscovered Hamlet in the English language the way the\nsculptor discovers his figure in the block” (1925, 28). A more\nprominent example of a philosopher who defends realism about works of\nart is Monroe C. Beardsley (1958), who seems to have espoused the\ndisjunctive thesis that a work of art is either a particular physical\nobject or a kind of physical object (see the entry on\nBeardsley’s aesthetics). Various other options for realism about\nartworks will be mentioned below. \n\nSome philosophers postulate a plurality of modes of being, and some of\nthese philosophers have attributed modes of being other than existence\nto works of art. An example is C. E. M. Joad, who included a fairly\nlengthy discussion of issues related to the ontology of art in his\npopular Guide to Philosophy of 1936. \n\nJoad denied that a work such as Shakespeare’s Hamlet\ncould be correctly identified with any existing concrete particular,\nsuch as a script, or with a collection of events, such as those\ninvolved in a staging of the play. Nor should the title\n‘Hamlet’ be taken as referring to ideas in the\nauthor’s mind, to some spectator’s experience of the work,\nor to some collection of experiences occasioned by performances of the\nplay. Joad’s alternative was to say that the work of art is\na subsistent object, neither mental nor material, which, like\nother universals, is a constituent of the universe possessing a\nspecial kind of being, subsistence, in its own right. According to\nJoad, then, at least some works are subsistent universals, and this is\nthe sort of entity to which the titles of such works of art refer. \n\nIn his Mellon lectures presented at the National Gallery in Washington\nin 1955 (published in 1957), Étienne Gilson classified works of\nart as Aristotelian substances (for background, see the entries on\nsubstance and Aristotle’s metaphysics).  Gilson also claimed that a\nwork has aesthetic and artistic modes of existence in addition to a\nsubstantial one. A work exists artistically qua product of\nthe artist’s activity, whereas it exists aesthetically when it is the\nobject of someone’s aesthetic (or contemplative) experience. A similar\nplurality of modes of existence of works of art had been postulated by\nÉtienne Souriau (1943, 1947), who posited thing-like\n[chosale], aesthetic, and transcendent modes of\nexistence. \n\nIn attributing artistic and aesthetic modes of existence to works,\nGilson adverted to a physical object’s relation to the\nexperiences and actions of cognizing subjects. Similarly, a long\nseries of philosophers have taken subjective relations and experiences\nto be crucial to answering the question of the existence of works of\nart. It has often been proposed, for example, that works are at least\nin part a product of the imagination, and this not merely in the sense\nthat some artist must imagine what sort of thing he or she wants to\nmake or do if a work of art is to be brought into existence.  Instead,\nthe thought is that even the existence or reality of a completed work\nof art continues to depend on the make-believe or imaginative activity\nof the artist or some other subject, such as the observer or reader\nwho appreciates the work as a work of art. \n\nThat the imagination plays a crucial role in aesthetic responses to\nboth art and nature was an important theme in 18th-century\naesthetics (see the entries on French, British, and German aesthetics\nin the 18th century).  Joseph Addison’s (1712)\ndescription of the “pleasures of the imagination” was\ninfluential, yet not as influential perhaps as Immanuel Kant’s\nidea that the activation of the power or faculty of the imagination\nwas essential to aesthetic judgments (for more detail, see the entry\non Kant’s aesthetics). In the 19th and\n20th centuries, various thinkers contended that the\nimagination plays a crucial role in both the creation and the\nreception of works of art. Prominent examples of philosophers who\nemphasized the importance of Einbildungskraft\nor Phantasie in this regard include Friedrich Theodor Vischer\n(1857, 1898), Robert Zimmermann (1865), Hermann Lotze (1884), Eduard\nvon Hartmann (1888), Karl Köstlin (1869, 1889), Konrad von Lange\n(1895, 1901, 1912, 1935), Christian von Ehrenfels (1896–1899,\n318), and Johannes Volkelt (1905–1915). \n\nVon Hartmann (1888, vol. 2, 11) rejects what he called\n“naïve realistic” assumptions about the objects of\naesthetic or artistic judgements. Arguing for a “transcendental\nrealism,” he contends that beauty is not a material object, but\na subjective appearance, like the sweetness of sugar.  Von Hartmann\nobserves that people confidently say such things as “this book\nis Homer’s Iliad,” “this score is Beethoven’s\nNinth Symphony,” and “this painting is\nRaphael’s Sistine Madonna.” Although it is often\nacknowledged that the first two examples are philosophically\nuntenable, it ought to be admitted, von Hartmann contends, that the\nthird sort of statement is also inaccurate. The painted surface in\nitself is not beautiful even though in some circumstances it has the\ncapacity to contribute to a subjective appearance of beauty, which von\nHartmann characterizes as Schein or Phantasie. If\nthe work of art is the bearer or locus of beauty and other\naesthetic properties, it cannot be the material object in itself. Yet\nHartmann also contests what he called “subjective\nidealism,” and in his discussion of artistic creation emphasizes\nthe artist’s engagement with the material constraints of artistic\nmedia. The “phantasy work” that an artist elaborates prior\nto the creation of an “external work of art” is never\nneutral with regard to media or instrumentation (1888, vol. 2,\n180). \n\nKonrad von Lange held that imaginative play and an attitude he called\n‘conscious self-deception’ [die bewusste\nSelbsttäuschung] are necessary to both the creation and\nappreciation of art. He did not explicitly draw the conclusion that\nworks of art are therefore fictions, but he did describe our commerce\nwith them as a kind of lucid illusion in which we playfully entertain\nthoughts of states of affairs that we know not to exist. The artistic\nartifact, he proposed, is like the toy or other object that is\nrecruited to the ends of a child’s imaginative play. A sophisticated\nand highly influential contemporary exponent of this kind of approach\nto art and, more specifically, to the philosophical analysis of\ndepiction and fictional content, is Kendall L. Walton (1990). \n\nJean-Paul Sartre (1938, 1940) has often been credited with the idea\nthat works of art are illusory (in the sense of systematically being\nthe object of some sort of error about their mode of existence), but\nit is not obvious that this is the best interpretation of his remarks\non the topic. Sartre declares that Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony\n“is outside of the real, outside of existence”\n(1940, 371, my trans.). He also says that we do not really hear the\nsymphony at all, but only hear the composition in our imaginations.\nSuch statements can be read as being meant to debunk a widespread\nillusory belief in the existence of musical works; they also hold open\nthe possibility of imagining works without believing in their\nexistence, in which case the putative illusion is not necessary.  One\nof the possible targets of Sartre’s remarks is a kind of idealist\ndoctrine discussed below. For an informative discussion of Sartre’s\nviews on the subject, see Peter V. Lamarque (2010, chapter 10); and\nfor additional background, see the entry on existentialist\naesthetics. \n\nOn this topic Sartre was preceded and possibly influenced by Ingarden\nand Nicolai Hartmann, who was professor of theoretical philosophy in\nBerlin at the time of Sartre’s stint at the Institut\nfrançais in Berlin from 1933–1934. In a paper\npresented at the International Congress of Philosophy held at Harvard\nin 1926 and published in 1927, Hartmann contrasted psychological and\nontological approaches in aesthetics and argued for the priority of\nthe latter. In this paper he outlined positions that he was to develop\nat length in a series of works, including his (1933) and an unfinished\ntreatise on aesthetics, written in 1945 and published posthumously in\n1953. \n\nHartmann’s central thesis on the ontology of art is that works\nare fictions that depend upon the perceptual and imaginative\nactivities of artists and their audiences. In Hartmann’s view,\nthe work of art has at least two parts or strata: the first layer,\nwhich he sometimes refers to as the “foreground,” is\nperceptible—Hartmann’s examples include a piece of stone,\ncolors on a surface, and audible sounds. The perception of such items\nis the basis of the aesthetic experience of the higher\n“background” stratum, which also requires imaginings\noccasioned by this perceptual experience. The artistic and aesthetic\nqualities of the work arise from the relation between these\n‘heterogeneous’ levels. Hartmann’s discussion of the\nartwork’s strata resembles some of the claims made by\nIngarden. It would appear that the two philosophers arrived at these\nresults independently; for a comparison of their positions, see\nWolfgang Ruttkowski (1990). \n\nHartmann maintains that as a result of its dependence upon the\nimagination, the work of art lacks independent or autonomous being, or\nwhat he calls ‘Ansichsein’. A work is an\nobserver-relative appearance or Erscheinung, experienced as\nsuch. An appearance experienced as appearance is not to be\nconfused, however, with illusion or Schein because it\ninvolves self-reflexive awareness that something is being imagined as\nopposed to believed. In this regard Hartmann evokes the familiar\nanalogy to children’s imaginative play, while commenting that\nfor the adult such play “remains fiction” (1953, 53). \n\nHartmann’s concept of artistic appearance does not embrace\nonly the depictive or symbolic contents of representational works of\nart, as Hartmann also applies his levels analysis to the aesthetic\nproperties of non-figurative works, including architectural ones.\nA building qua material object obviously figures amongst the\nreal entities of the world, but to experience the material building as\na work of art is to engage in the imaginative apprehension of fictional\nqualities. Hartmann appears to be claiming in this regard that\nsuch terms as ‘grandiose’, ‘pompous’ or\n‘majestic’, are, when used as labels to name the aesthetic\nqualities of a building, in some sense imaginative and hence\nfictional. \n\nKindred approaches to the question of the work’s existence\nhave been developed by a number of different figures, an early instance\nbeing the American philosopher Stephen C. Pepper, who describes how the\nimagination contributes to a process in which “an aesthetic work\nof art is created out of a physical work of art” (1937a, 231;\n1955). Pepper, who was a professor of philosophy at the\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, was on the same panel as Hartmann\nat the 1926 Congress mentioned above. It is not clear, however,\nwhether Pepper embraced Hartmann’s conclusion that works of art\nare in some sense fictions. Pepper argued for a relativist\nconception whereby ontological issues depend ultimately on such\noverarching rival frameworks as organicism, mechanism, and pragmatism\nor “contextualism.” Pepper explicitly denied that any\none of these frameworks was the one true theory. \n\nAnother philosopher whose early contributions merit attention in\nthis vein is Joseph Margolis (1958, 1959, 1961). Margolis\ndescribes a work of art as being comprised of a physical system (for\nexample, a lump of clay) and an aesthetic design. To behold\nsomething as a work of art, it is necessary to combine a sensory\nperception of the physical item with an imaginative experience of the\naesthetic design. The design “supervenes” upon the\nphysical system. Margolis suggests that whereas contradictory\nassertions about a physical object cannot both be true, the principle\nof noncontradiction does not apply to the description of works of\nart. \n\nMargolis (1958) explicitly endorses one implication of his\nhypothesis regarding the way of being or Seinsweise of the\nwork of art. In the absence of the right sort of attention, the\nwork ceases to exist, even though the physical system remains\nintact. Yet the same work can return to existence when the same\nsort of imaginative attention is directed upon the physical system that\nconstitutes the supervenience base of the artwork, thereby\n“reviving” the correlative aesthetic design. \n\nSeveral philosophers (e.g., Eleanor Rowland 1913, 117, Gilson 1957,\nHilde Hein 1959, Andrew Harrison 1967–68, Currie 1989, 57) have\nquestioned the wisdom of allowing that the existence of a work is\nintermittent. An early example is Johannes Volkelt (1905, 11), who\nasserts that the statue of Zeus in Otricoli was a work of art\nthroughout the many centuries during which it lay buried and\nunobserved. As Wolterstorff later put it, “Have not\nBeethoven’s quartets, Rembrandt’s prints, and\nYeats’s poems existed at least ever since their\ncomposition?” (1980, 43). As will become apparent below, a\ndesire to find some alternative to the hypothesis of intermittent\nexistence has influenced some of the proposals about the category of\nenduring or perduring entities to which artworks should be said to\nbelong. For example, Andrew Paul Ushenko characterized works as powers\nso as to avoid the intermittence problem (1953, 47), and similar\nintuitions motivated Pepper’s (1965)\n“double-dispositional” account, according to which a\nwork’s continuous existence depends on the “passive\ndisposition” of a physical object as well as the “dynamic\ndisposition” of the observer. \n\nIt would be quite misleading to give the impression that all of those\nphilosophers who thought minds and their activities have something to\ndo with the existence of works of art also thought that this means\nthat works were somehow less real than, say, natural physical entities\nand events. Idealists invert this hierarchy. This is explicit in\nBenedetto Croce (1913, 1965, 9–10) when he asserts that works of\nart cannot be physical entities because works of art are\n“supremely real” whereas the physical world is\n“unreal.” \n\nAnother proponent of an idealist ontology of art is Waldemar Conrad\n(1908–09). Conrad stressed Edmund Husserl’s contrast\nbetween “natural” and “phenomenological”\nattitudes and their objects (for background, see the entries on\nHusserl and phenomenology). Conrad asserts that only the latter\nattitude can reveal the “ideal Object” that is the genuine\nor intended [gemeinte] work of art. In his example, which\ncould well have served as the counterpoint for Sartre’s\ndiscussion of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony, the genuine work is\nthe symphony itself as opposed to the various spatiotemporal events,\nsuch as more or less competent orchestral performances, or\nsomeone’s whistling the melody or reading the score, that might\nhelp to direct attention to some of the work’s essential\nfeatures (1908–09, 77–78). Conrad does not present a\ndetailed defense of his assumptions about the ontology of ideal\nobjects, but clearly shared Husserl’s aversion to psychologism\n(for background, see the entry on psychologism). \n\nCroce’s (1902, 1913, 1948) claims about works (and ideas) as\n“expressions” of experience generated a lot of controversy\nand did much to put ontological issues on the agenda of aesthetics and\nthe philosophy of art (for background, see the entry on Croce’s\naesthetics). British proponents of Croce-inspired aesthetics\nincluded Lascelles Abercrombie (1922), who promoted the idea that the\nwork is an experience, and P. Leon (1931), who rhapsodized about the\naesthetic object as an experienced quale. Drawing upon a\nbroad Platonic and Romantic background, George W. Beiswanger (1939)\ndeveloped the view that the “material” work is merely a\nmeans to the aesthetic object, which he characterized as\n“experienced experiencing,” an idea inspired, apparently,\nby John Dewey’s remark that “the actual work of art is what\nthe product does with and in experience” (1934, 3). \n\nBy far the most influential Croce-inspired aesthetician was Robin\nGeorge Collingwood (1925, 1938), whose several translations of\nCroce’s work helped make the Italian philosopher’s views\nmore accessible to readers bereft of Italian (for background and\nreferences, see Alan Donagan 1972). As Collingwood’s\nphilosophy of art is the subject of a separate entry as well as various\ncommentaries (e.g., Ian Winchester 2004, David Davies 2008), we can be\nbrief here. For some purposes talk of a\n“Croce-Collingwood” theory of art is good enough, but of\ncourse differences come to the fore when one reads these authors with\nan eye to detail. It seems fair to say that for Collingwood, the\nwork of art is not a physical object or finished artifact, but the\nconscious imaginative activity through which creative expression takes\nplace. That works are the activity of the imagination does not\nmake them any less real in Collingwood’s opinion. \n\nAn objection to all theories that invite us to think of\nworks of art as experiences—those of the artist and/or those of\nthe audience—is that this is a conflation of an experience and\nthe object of the experience. It is one thing to acknowledge that\na work is the product or even the expression of an experience and\nthat it is designed to occasion certain kinds of experiences; it is\nsomething else entirely to assert that the work is itself an experience\nand nothing more. Such an account neglects the physical\ndimensions of art, beginning with the artist’s encounter with\nmaterials and media. It is also objected that the attempted\nreduction of artworks to experiences would convert a public, culturally\nsituated entity into something private. Early worries of this\nsort were articulated in relation to Croce’s aesthetics by\nAlexander (1925) and Louis Arnauld Reid (1926). More recently,\nthese objections have been raised against Roger Scruton’s (1997)\nontology of musical works by Jerrold Levinson (2000), who explicitly\nlinks Scruton’s account to the legacy of Collingwood and\nidealism. \n\nNot all philosophers have agreed that all works of art must be\npublic. In his taxonomy of the fine arts, Bernard Bolzano\ndistinguishes between the arts of the external senses and those of\npure thought (1849, 16). The latter arts produce works comprised of\ncomplex ideas or thoughts that are not linguistically articulated and\nthat are only directly accessible to the person thinking of\nthem. Bolzano remarks that this feature of the arts of pure thought is\na great imperfection. He adds, however, that these arts often play a\nrole in the creation of those works of art, such as statues and songs,\nthat are perceptible to audiences. \n\nGiven a sufficiently austere ontology, titles such as ‘Das Lied\nvon der Erde’ and ‘To the Lighthouse’ have no real\nreferents. Those who defend such an ontology are rarely eager to\ntrumpet the implications for the arts, perhaps because doing so would\nbe a poor recommendation for the austerity. A few thinkers writing\nabout aesthetics have, however, conjectured that we would be better\noff without committing ourselves to the existence of works. For\nexample, Richard Rudner (1950) distinguished between questions about\nthe object of our aesthetic responses and questions about the\nreferents of the names of works. The answer to the latter question is\nthat such names are non-designative or syncategorematic. The former\nquestion, Rudner concludes, is not scientific and should be set\naside. \n\nRoland Barthes (1971) notoriously asserted that the concept of the\nwork of art is part of a repressive ideology that should be replaced\nby a liberating conception of textuality. The word\n‘textualité’ referred in his mind to a highly\nindeterminate and exciting sphere of semantic and erotic\npossibilities; ‘une œuvre’ [a work] stood for an\nideological drag involving wrong-headed thinking about fixed meanings,\nownership, and repression. \n\nIn a somewhat similar spirit but without Barthes’s\npoststructuralist idiom, Stephen David Ross (1977) contends that there\nis no work of art simpliciter, but any number of discriminable\nachievements or loci of artistic value. \n\nAnders Pettersson (1981, 1984, 1990, 2009, 2012) contends that talk of\na text or literary work can be eliminated. He acknowledges that the\nconcept of a literary work forms part of ordinary language and is\nuseful in theoretically undemanding contexts, but he also argues that\nit is a self-contradictory construct that creates many pseudo-problems\nfor literary theory. We can say what we need to say about literature\nin a theoretically adequate way without making any ontological\ncommitments to texts or works and without introducing any new entities\nby referring to such phenomena as physical copies of texts, texts in\nthe sense of sequences of signs, or meaning in its different\nvarieties. \n\nA more recent proponent of an eliminativist strategy is Ross P. Cameron\n(2008), who contends that we need not make works of art part of our\nfundamental metaphysics. Even so, we can still hold our common\nsense statements about them to be true. For criticisms of the\nidea that this eliminativist position is compatible with common sense\nor well-entrenched practices, see Robert Stecker (2009) and Stefano\nPredelli (2009). \n\nIn this context ‘monism’ is simply a label for the idea\nthat all works of art fall within one ontological category, such as\nabstract particulars. A prevalent argument against this sort of thesis\nrests on the distinction between performance and non-performance\nworks: many musical works can be performed by various persons and on\nvarious occasions; a painting cannot. Having described such\ndistinctions amongst works of art, Wolterstorff concludes tersely that\n“Works of art are not all alike in their ontological\nstatus” (1975, 230). According to Stephen Davies (1993), we need\nnot look beyond the art of music to find grounds for rejecting\nontological monism. More recently, Robert Howell (2002a, 2002b) has\nargued that if the term ‘work of art’ covers artistic\nimprovisations, the various utterances referred to as ‘oral\nliterature’, and such items as paintings and scored musical\ncompositions, then no single adequate ontological category is to be\nfound. With reference to artists’ stipulative authority over the\n“features and boundaries” of their works, Sherri Irvin\ndeclares that “Any claim to the effect that all works belong to\nthe same ontological category will thus come out false or\nuninformative” (2008, 1). Yet as will become clear below, monism\nstill has its proponents. \n\nMany debates over monism and rivals to that position have hinged on\nthe question of reproduction and multiple instances, the thought being\nthat in the case of at least some works, adequate technologies of\nreproduction yield more than one instance of an artistic artifact, and\ntherefore of the work (an entailment that does not go\nunchallenged, as we shall see below). For example, it would be highly\nimplausible to contend that Henri Cartier-Bresson’s famous\nphotographic work, “Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris”\n(1932), consists in the negative used to make prints, or in the first\nor any other single print of this picture. Multiply instantiated works\nform one major category, then, while singular or non-reproducible ones\nform another. \n\nIt has been complained, however, that this distinction ought not to\nbe taken as decisive for an ontology of art since it rests upon a\ncontingent thesis about what is technologically possible. \n\nThe question of how technological change can influence our basic\nconception of works of art was raised by Walter Benjamin in a famous\nessay, a first version of which appeared in French in 1936 (translated\nliterally, the title is ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its\nMechanical Reproducibility’). Benjamin is generally interpreted\nas claiming that the advent of techniques of mechanical reproduction\nhas undermined the quasi-religious “aura” that previously\nsurrounded the individual work of art. Benjamin appears to have viewed\nsuch technological change as part of a liberating or progressive\nhistorical process. Whether Benjamin held that no work of art really\nwas or could be an “authentic” concrete particular is hard\nto determine, however, as the history of art’s political\nfunctions is the primary focus of his somewhat obscure essay. Benjamin\ndoes declare early on (in both the first and revised versions of his\nessay) that “In principle, the work of art has always been\nreproducible. Objects made by humans could always be copied by\nhumans” (2008, 20). \n\nOther philosophers have argued that technological possibility should\nnot be thought decisive with regard to the soundness of a monist\nontology of art: the important philosophical question is what is\nnomologically or metaphysically possible. A relatively early\nexample is C. I. Lewis’s oft-overlooked (1946) discussion of the\nontology of the work of art. \n\nDrawing on the work of Pepper and D. W. Prall (1929, 1936), Lewis held\nthat an aesthetic appreciation of art is based on the contemplation of\nan “aesthetic essence” presented by the work. Lewis\ndescribes an aesthetic essence as “a certain composition of\nsense or qualia” and as “an immediate apprehension of\nsense” (1946, 188). Lewis also writes in this context of\n“qualitatively identical items of content (Santayana’s\n‘essences’?)” (1946, 18), thereby suggesting he is\nnot quite sure whether his notion of an essence comes close to that of\nGeorge Santayana, who described essences as the immediate data of\nexperience (1923). (For background, see the entry on Clarence Irving\nLewis, and especially the section on “the given.”) \nWhen we appreciate a painting, Lewis contends, what we contemplate is\nwhat this canvas could have in common with some optimal reproduction\nof it, namely, “that qualitative and abstract essence which is\nhere incorporated, and is theoretically repeatable in some other\nphysical object” (1946, 477). Lewis claims that an aesthetic\nobject always depends upon some physical object, but he maintains that\nthese dependency relations differ in degree: a poem depends on a\nparticular inscription less than a work of visual art depends on a\nparticular visible object. A poem, he proposes, is “an\nabstraction which is actualized in the instances of its presentation,\nthrough the medium of some physical vehicle. It is an entity\nessentially repeatable in, or common to, different physical events or\nthings which instance it” (1946, 474–475). Lewis goes on to say\nthat the abstractness of works is not like that of universals in that\nthe latter “stand in contrast to anything which is sensuously\nqualitative and imaginal” (1946, 475). Lewis also maintains that\na work or art is not just a type of visual appearance abstracted from\na physical object, or in Lewis’s terms, an artistic\nvehicle. Instead, for Lewis, the aesthetic essence constitutive of the\nidentity of the work of art, as opposed to the physical object,\n“lies in the context associated with this physical\nentity which presents it” (1946, 474, Lewis’s\nitalics). Lewis holds that if the observer does not take this\nassociated context into account in the interpretation of the vehicle,\nthe work of art is misapprehended or not apprehended at all:\n“whatever the subject must bring to the presentation, in order\ncorrectly to understand the poem presented, belongs to the poem”\n(1946, 474). \n\nNote that Lewis considers every aesthetic essence to be “an\nabstraction which theoretically could be identically presented by\nanother physical thing” (1946, 476). Similar claims to the\neffect that all works of art are multiple, at least in principle and\nqua objects of appreciation, were subsequently made by Ushenko\n(1953, 21–25), Peter Strawson (1959, 231, n. 1; 1974, 183), Jeanne\nWacker (1960), Anthony Savile (1971), Eddie Zemach (1966, 1986), and\nCurrie (1989).  \n\nMany other writers have, on the contrary, stressed the singularity of\nat least some works of art and/or some of their constituents.\nCroce’s influential (1903) diatribe against the\n“science” of genres stands at the top of a list that\nincludes George Boas (1937), Henri Focillon (1934, 56), Souriau (1947,\n70), Stuart Hampshire (1952), Ingarden (1962), Nelson Goodman (1968),\nRichard Wollheim (1968), Wolterstorff (1975, 1980), Catherine Lord\n(1977), Mark Sagoff (1978), E. J. Lowe (1983), Levinson (1987, 1996),\nGérard Genette (1994), Anthony O’Hear (1995), Irvin\n(2008), and Michael Weh (2010). \n\nThe diversity of arguments and positions on this broad particularist\ntheme should be noted. For example, Ingarden reacts negatively to the\nprospect of a multiplicity of perfect replicas of the cathedral of\nNotre Dame de Paris: seeing such things side by side, he comments,\nwould cause “the strongest displeasure, precisely because it\nbelongs to the nature of the work of art to be an individual, in the\nsense of something qualitatively unique” (1989, 274; 1962,\n278). O’Hear defends a “singularity thesis” to the\neffect that “works of distinction” are necessarily\nindividual and unique, whereas Weh argues that artistic intentions\nconstrained by the historical circumstances determine whether and when\na work is reproducible or multiple. Wolterstorff’s line on this\ntopic is that in the case of many paintings, the artist does not\nsettle on a set of properties that establish criteria for correctness\nof instances or “occurrences” of the work (1980,\n72). Genette maintains that the reproducibility of works of art is a\nmatter of an institutionally codified consensus based on a balance\nbetween means and needs (1994, 101). \n\nIn a paper published posthumously in 2001, Frank Sibley contends that\na “two-directional pull” is a pervasive feature of the\npractices and discourses of art, at least with regard to visual works\nof art such as the Mona Lisa. If a painting is a particular\nphysical object, the work of art referred to as the Mona Lisa\nmay or may not be a painting: “Perhaps it both is and is not,\ncan be and need not be” (2001, 272). We are interested in the\nunique physical object, yet we also find that a copy can serve many of\nthe same functions, including artistic and aesthetic ones. So either\nwe have two distinct concepts of works of this kind, or we have\ninherited what Sibley calls an “uneasy composite or hybrid of\ntwo conflicting notions” (2001, 272). \n\nOne source of confusion in this area is divergent assumptions about\nboth the extension and intension of the expression ‘work of\nart’ and its cognates: what is it, exactly, that can or cannot\nbe classified in a single, basic ontological category? Whereas Virgil\nAldrich (1963) proclaims the term ‘work of art’ useful\nbecause of its ambivalence, others (e.g., Boas 1937) have found the\npervasive ambiguity in the discourse about artworks (starting with a\nprocess/product conflation) troublesome and in need of\nclarification. I. A. Richards famously wrote that people\n“naturally talk about poems (and pictures, etc.) in a way which\nmakes it impossible for anybody to discover what it is we are talking\nabout” (1924, 176).  Evoking the “vague” and\n“diverse” usage of the term, Francis Sparshott (1963)\nworried that the question about what sort of thing a work of art is\nmight have no precise answer.  Richard Shusterman concurs, and passes\nthe question of the identity of the work of art along to the\n“piecemeal efforts of practicing art critics” (1980,\n543). Claudine Tercelin (2005) develops a Peircean perspective attuned\nto the possibility of an irreducible, ontic vagueness in art (and\nelsewhere). \n\nThomasson (2005) argues that the relevant sortals yield only vague and\nincomplete identity and persistence conditions. As a result, some\nquestions in the ontology of art admit of no precise answers. A good\nexample would be the question of just how faulty a performance of a\ndifficult composition can be and still count as a performance of the\nwork. She also holds that there is no justifiable response to the\nquestion of whether a poem has actually been created when the poet has\na complete sequence of words in mind but has never spoken it aloud or\nwritten it down (2005, 227). Thomasson’s skepticism, however, is\na limited one: some art-ontological questions do have determinate\nanswers about which sufficiently well-informed practitioners in the\nworld of art could not be wrong. Thomasson reasons that competent\nusers of the discourse successfully refer to particular novels,\npaintings, and symphonies, so they must have reliable concepts when it\ncomes to the relevant art kinds. Thomasson does not, however, believe\nthat the same argument works for the more general concept, work of\nart. \n\nDominic McIver Lopes (2007) accepts the premise that art-ontological\nquestions find answers in sound art-appreciative practice, but\nconjectures, with reference to examples of Japanese architecture, that\nsuch practices vary significantly across cultures. Rafael De Clercq\n(2008) proposes an alternative explication of the Japanese examples;\nin a response to De Clercq, Lopes surveys the options and concludes\nthat they “all challenge some widespread philosophical doctrines\nabout the cultural invariance of ontology or reference” (2008,\n196).\n\n \n\nPepper, who struggled with art-ontological issues for several decades,\nended up proclaiming in his (1952) that ‘work of art’ is\nbest understood as a “portmanteau” expression on which are\nhung significantly different conceptual garments. In his early\nwritings on the ontology of art (e.g., 1937b, 231; 1946), Pepper had\ndistinguished between the work of art and “the aesthetic\nwork.” In response to published objections and queries (Nathan\nBerall 1951, James L. Jarrett 1952, Robert Hoffman 1962), he later\ndrew a distinction between what he proposed to call ‘the control\nobject’ (that he had previously referred to as the\n‘physical work of art’ or ‘the vehicle’) and\nthe object of critical evaluation (previously, ‘the aesthetic\nwork of art’). \n\nVarious terms for a distinction in this vicinity have been\nemployed. Hermann Siebek (1875, 7) and von Hartmann (1888, vol. 2, 35,\n208) both used the term ‘Vehikel’ to refer to the\nmaterial or perceptible bases of aesthetic objects and works of\nart. Volkelt (1905, 11) used the term\n‘Ausserdinge’ to refer to the non-psychological\nitems that make up what he called the “pre-aesthetic basis of\nthe work of art.” H. S. Goodhart-Rendel (1934) distinguished\nbetween the material of art, the artistic vehicle, and the work of\nart. His idea is that the vehicle is whatever is used to\n“externalize” the work or to “disclose it to the\nworld” (1934, 4). In the case of music, the sound is the\nvehicle; sound is not the artist’s material, however, because\nsome musicians can compose in their heads, and on\nGoodhart-Rendel’s usage, only those media that are necessary to\nworking in an art form are to be taken as materials. All that is\nstrictly necessary to musical composition is an idea or thought of a\nsequence of sounds. \n\nThe term ‘vehicle’ was taken up again by Harold Osborne,\nwho defined it as what “enables the same organization of material\nto enter the experience of different persons at different times”\n(1953, 96). A particular arrangement of pigments upon a canvas or\nsome other surface could be the vehicle of a work, but the work itself\nis distinct from its material component. The work is not the\nvehicle alone, but “an enduring possibility, often enshrined or\nrecorded in a material medium, of a specific set of sensory\nimpressions” (1953, 100). \n\nFor those who dislike the medical and other connotations of the term\n‘vehicle’, there are other options. Ruby Meager uses\nthe term ‘manifestation’, commenting that “a poem is\nlike a universal in being capable of multiple manifestations of which\nno single one can count as the poem itself” (1958–59, 52).\nMany writers have preferred the term ‘instances’.\nCurrie, for example, defines ‘instance’ as “all those\nconcrete things that we come into contact with when we experience a\nwork of art” (1989, 5). \n\nWhy distinguish between the work of art and its vehicle,\nmanifestation, or control object? Various reasons have motivated such\ndistinctions. One line of thought is that a work is\n“constituted” by a material object or vehicle, where the\nconstitution relation is not a matter of identity (for background, see\nthe entry on material constitution). Roger Pouivet (2000, 2010) has\nbrought such arguments to bear on a number of issues in the ontology\nof art. Simon J. Evnine (2009, 2016) develops a constitution theory as\nwell. \n\nJohn Dilworth (2005a) distinguishes between the concrete artifact or\nevent and the artwork. In his view the relation between them is\nrepresentational. The artifact or event represents the work, which in\nturn represents other content, namely, the subject matter of the\nwork. \n\nIn an analogy that some philosophers (e.g., Arthur C. Danto 1993,\n199–200) have taken quite seriously, the vehicle is to the work\nas the body is to the person; for a very early remark in this vein,\nsee Johan Georg Sulzer (1792, vol. 4, 727), who declares that the work\nof art has both body (the artistic material or Stoff), and\nsoul or Geist (the representation\nor Darstellung). Another way of motivating the distinction in\naesthetics is to say, along with Pepper and others, that reference to\nthe vehicle or artistic structure alone does not suffice to identify\nthe object of critical evaluation, or what artistic and aesthetic\nappreciation is really about. \n\nThe next section evokes a commonly told story about the basis\nof a work-object distinction, indicating some ways in which this story\nis misleading. \n\nIn his widely cited 1964 paper, “The Artworld,” Danto\ncleverly evoked ways in which perceptually indistinguishable painted\ncanvases could be the vehicles of strikingly different works of art\nbearing different titles and contrasting artistic and aesthetic\nqualities. It follows, Danto reasons, that the painted canvas\nalone is not the work of art, unless‘is’has a special sense. \n\nIn a reply to questions raised by Sparshott (1976), Danto claimed to\nhave been “loosely following a famous model in the philosophy of\nperception” when he began to explore the implications of\nindiscernibles for issues in aesthetics (1976, 80). Yet at the\noutset of the second chapter of his 1981 book, The Transfiguration\nof the Commonplace, Danto commented: “the possibility was\nfirst recognized, I believe, in connection with literary works, by\nBorges, who has the glory of having discovered it in his masterpiece,\nPierre Menard, Symbolist Poet” [sic].  \n\nIt is certainly the case that many philosophers have found inspiration\nin Jorge Luis Borges’s 1939 story, “Pierre Menard, autor\ndel Quijote,” an English translation of which first appeared in\n1962 (for more on this topic, see Livingston and Pettersson\n2016). This short story is not easy to summarize, but one relevant\npart of it concerns a French symbolist who sets out to create a novel\nby rewriting—without simply copying—the text of\nCervantes’s masterpiece. The narrator of the story makes\nobservations about ways in which Menard’s work would be\ndifferent from Cervantes’s even if Menard somehow managed to\nproduce something “verbally identical” to what Cervantes\nhad written. \n\nIn English-language philosophical publications, the earliest reference\nto the tale and to its implications for the ontology of art appears in\nSavile’s (1971) essay on Goodman’s Languages of\nArt (for background, see the entry on Goodman’s\naesthetics). Subsequent references to the story’s philosophical\nimplications include Walton (1973), Wollheim (1978), Goodman (1978),\nDavid K. Lewis (1978), Levinson (1980a, 2012), Ben Tilghman (1982),\nSusan Wilsmore (1987), Currie (1989), Jean-Marie Schaefer (1989),\nMichael Wreen (1990), David Davies (1991, 2010), Christopher Janaway\n(1992), Lamarque (1998, 2010), Jacques Morizot (1999), and the papers\nin Petr Kot’átko and Karel Cisar (2004). \n\nSavile presented what he referred to as the\n“Borges-paradox” in order to contest some of\nGoodman’s claims about the individuation of works of art.  More\nspecifically, Goodman had distinguished between\n“autographic” and “allographic” works, where\nthe former, unlike the latter, are susceptible to forgery. Moving\nquickly, the thought is that while it is possible to make a more or\nless successful forgery of a particular painting, it is impossible to\nmake a deceptive copy of a work of literature because any verbally\nidentical instance of the text is a good copy of the work, or in\nGoodman’s terms, an instance produced in conformity with a\nsystem of notation (for discussion of Goodman’s distinction, see\nLevinson 1980b, Pillow 2003, and the entry on\n Goodman’s aesthetics). \n\nSavile presents the Pierre Menard case as a counterexample to\nGoodman’s thesis that the identity conditions of allographic\nworks are determined by a notational scheme. \n\nTwo numerically distinct tokens of the same “verbally\nidentical” text-type could be generated by different literary\nauthors—Menard and Cervantes—working in significantly\ndifferent artistic contexts. These could, then, be the texts of two\nartistically different works. Ergo, the work is not the text. Turning\nfrom literature to music, Savile asks us to imagine a case where\nStockhausen independently composes “an ode notationally and\nsemantically identical” with a composition by Stamitz. Savile\nproposes that “We should certainly not say that they had\ncomposed the same work, for the way in which it would be appropriate\nto hear them would be quite different” (1971, 23; cf. Levinson\n1980a). \n\nThe Borgesian narrator also floats the idea that one work could have\ntwo artistically different texts, which could be taken as reinforcing\na Borges-inspired assault on a text-to-work biconditional (Paisley\nLivingston 2005a). Generalizing, we end up with a broad distinction\nbetween works of art and their “objects” or vehicles. \n\nThere has unsurprisingly been some skepticism about both\nthe distinction between vehicle and work, and the idea that cogent\nreasoning in favor of such a distinction is really to be found in the\nBorges story. Tilghman (1982), Currie (1989, 134 n. 19) and\nLamarque (2010), for example, raise questions about the intelligibility\nand coherence of that part of the Borges story that concerns Pierre\nMenard’s unusual intentions and putative achievement with regard\nto the writing of “his” Quixote. What are we supposed\nto imagine about Menard’s ambition in setting out to\n“rewrite” but not copy the text of the novel by\nCervantes? Is this a psychologically coherent project? What\nis more, is there any good reason to think of his text as a new\nwork? For denials, see Goodman (1978) and Goodman and Catherine\nZ. Elgin (1988), who contend that Menard’s text, if brought to\ncompletion, would only be a “replica” of\nCervantes’s. \n\nWith regard to the text-work distinction and the more general\narguments given in support of it, various doubts have been\nraised. Wollheim (1993) challenges the evidentiary value of thought\nexperiments in a context where the concept in question—in this\ncase, the one evoked by the expression ‘work of\nart’—has no determinate conditions for its application,\nbut only some broad assumptions that can easily be\n“transgressed” by the apparent results of a thought\nexperiment. Tilghman had complained a decade earlier that Danto did\nnot specify any criteria of work constitution. Tilghman (1982) added\nthat the ontological question of constitution is in any case not\ncrucial to questions about criticism and appreciation. \n\nIt can also be reasonably doubted whether the Borges story truly\nmerits the “glory” of discovery to which Danto\nalludes. Lamarque (1998, 2010) finds evidence of the key\ncontextualist insight, or at least closely related points, in passages\nfrom both Shakespeare and Kant. \n\nAnother earlier and little-known contribution on our topic was made by\nthe Danish physician and neurologist, Carl Georg Lange\n(1834–1900). Lange’s book of 1899, Bidrag til\nNydelsernes Fysiologi som grundlag for en rationel æstetik,\nthe title of which can be translated quite literally as\n‘Contribution to the Physiology of the Pleasures as Foundation\nfor a Rational Aesthetics’, begins with a lengthy survey of the\nauthor’s ideas about the nature of the various sources of\nenjoyment or pleasure, and then moves on to apply these ideas to the\narts and beauty. \n\nLange argues that the various sorts of enjoyments or pleasures [the\nDanish ‘nydelser’ is ambiguous between the two]\ngiven to us by works of art have a few basic sources, including\nvariety [afvekslingen] and the arousal of sympathy. He also\nstresses the art appreciator’s admiration of the artist’s manifest\novercoming of artistic difficulties in the creation of the work. The\nawareness that very few people, or perhaps even only a unique\nindividual [den Enkelte], could have brought about a particularly\ninnovative and difficult artistic achievement is a distinct source of artistic\nenjoyment. Lange wants to argue that this type of artistic enjoyment\ndepends upon the appreciator’s awareness of aspects of the art\nobject’s origins. One can only admire a work, in the special sense of\nartistic admiration or ‘beundring’ conceived of\nby Lange, to the extent that one can understand and evaluate the\nartistic difficulties the artist has overcome. Although Lange here\nrepeats a claim made in earlier aesthetic treatises (e.g. Véron\n1878, 63), he takes the argument one step further. He turns to an\nimaginary indiscernibility example in an effort to make a point about\nthe relevant aspects “in a work” [i et\nVærk] that can give rise to the special kind of enjoyment\nhe has in mind: \n\nLange holds, in other words, that one object of aesthetic admiration\nand enjoyment is the relational event of artist A in\ncontext C creating something sufficiently novel to provide an\naudience with a certain type of pleasure. Lange explicitly insists\nthat the kind of value he has in mind is “in” the work,\nbut not an intrinsic feature of the (tokens of) the visually identical\nimage type. \n\nAs will become apparent below, the debate between monisms and their\nrivals in the ontology of art continues. \n\nPhilosophers who have asked themselves what sorts of things works of\nart are have had recourse to a bewildering array of received and newly\npostulated ontological categories. The following survey is not\nexhaustive, but identifies some of the most prominent proposals\npublished in the period focused on in this entry. \n\nPlatonism about works of art can be understood as the thesis that some\nor even all works of art are abstract entities that have no\nspatiotemporal location (for background, see the entry on platonism in\nmetaphysics). It is most common to conjoin a platonist account of\nworks in some art forms, such as music and literature, with a\ndifferent account, i.e. the physical object hypothesis, of works in\nother art forms, such as painting and dance. Recent advocates of\nplatonism in the ontology of art include Peter Kivy (1983, 1987) and\nJulian Dodd (2000, 2007, 2010). Noteworthy recent critiques of\nplatonist theses in the ontology of art include Stephen Davies (1993,\n2003b, 2008), Predelli (1995, 2001), Saam Trivedi (2002), Andrew Kania\n(2008a, 2008b, 2012), David Davies (2009a, 2009b), Marcus Rossberg\n(2012), Chris Tillman (2011), and Gary Ostertag (2012). \n\nSome of the objections to platonism in art ontology are versions of\nlongstanding criticisms of the postulation of abstract objects, such\nas the objection that the instantiation relation between universals\nand their particular manifestations leads to a regress, or is obscure\nor inexplicable. Other objections are raised by philosophers who do\nnot reject all postulations of knowable abstract objects, but who\nnonetheless find that works of art are not adequately classified as\nsuch items. \n\nOne worry about platonism with regard to music runs as follows: if a\nsound, and the hearing of a sound, are spatiotemporal events, and if a\nmusical work is an abstract type that has no spatiotemporal location\nand that exists independently of particular performances of it, how\ncould it be literally true to say that a musical work has\nsuch-and-such sounds? Do platonists about musical works have to accept\nthe conclusion that musical works are, strictly speaking, inaudible\n(Davies 2009b)? Another worry concerns performances and their relation\nto the abstract objects of which they are a performance: if a musical\nwork is a fully determinate abstract object, how could an\ninterpretative performance of it be necessary to its\nappreciation (Predelli 1995, 2001)?  \n\nRudner raised another objection that is often taken up in the\nliterature (e.g., Caplan and Matheson 2004). If a work such as\nBeethoven’s Fifth Symphony is an abstract entity, this\nwould have “as a counter-intuitive consequence a denial that\nBeethoven created the Fifth Symphony” (1950, 385). \n\nHere we encounter a paradox, or incoherent conjunction of thoughts\neach of which has some intuitive appeal when examined separately.  As\nKania (2008a, 22) and Cameron (2008, 295) put it in the context of\ndiscussions of the ontology of musical works, the triad may be\nspecified as follows: \n\nMany philosophers (e.g., Wolterstorff 1980, Kivy 1987, Currie 1989)\nhave thought that this paradox is best resolved by rejecting (A). For\nothers, such as Haig Khatchadourian (1960) and Renée Cox\n(1985), (A) is true; works of art should be recognized as items that\ncome into existence and can be destroyed. Given this premise, which is\ndefended at length by Charles Nussbaum (2003), the trio may be\ninterpreted as a reductio of (B). Yet giving up on (B) would\nseem to require us to overlook the obvious fact that we commonly speak\nof a musical work as being repeatable. Cannot the same recorded song\nbe replayed on multiple occasions? Another strategy is to restore\ncoherence by revising only (C). Margaret MacDonald (1952–1953)\nproposes that works are abstract types that are genuinely created by\nthe artist or author. Similarly, Thomasson argues that at least some\nworks of art (i.e., musical and literary works) are a kind of\n“abstract artifact” meriting recognition as genuine\ncreations (1999, 2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2010). Barry Smith (2008) also\nargues for what he calls ‘quasi-abstract patterns’, which\nlike numbers are nonphysical and nonpsychological, but which are tied,\nthrough the actions of agents, to a time and historical\ncontext. Anthony Ralls (1972) characterizes works as created\nuniversals concretely embodied through the intentional activities of\nartists. Peter Alward (2004) contends that the paradox is generated by\ninappropriate assumptions about types, and that genuine artistic\ncreation is compatible with a continuant/stage model of works and\nperformances. Lee Walters (2013) argues for a solution to the paradox\nbased on the thesis that works are created types. He responds to an\narray of objections to this approach, including those advanced in\nAllan Hazlett (2012). \n\nMany philosophers who have sought to say what sorts of entities works\nof art are have spoken of ‘types’ and\n‘tokens’, an idiom which can be traced back to Charles\nSanders Peirce (1931–1958, IV, para. 537, 423). (For background,\nincluding a discussion of Peirce’s statements on the topic, see the\nentry on types and tokens.) One idea that some art ontologists have\nfound promising is that as a special sort of abstraction, types have\nfeatures that should be kept in mind as we seek to solve the paradox\nof creation and other vexed issues, such as the question of how a work\nof art can have particular perceptible qualities if it is an\nimperceptible abstract object. As becomes apparent below, however, the\nconclusions on this score have been quite diverse. \n\nAlthough Wollheim has at times wrongly been credited with this move,\nthe earliest explicit reference to the type-token distinction in the\nliterature on the ontology of art is to be found in Rudner\n(1950). Subsequent philosophers who have discussed applications of\ntype-token distinctions in the philosophy of art include Charles\nStevenson (1957, 1958), Meager (1958–59) Margolis (1958, 1959,\n1961), W. D. L. Scobie (1960), Wacker (1960), Khatchadourian (1960),\nRuth Saw (1961), Donald F. Henze (1957, 1961), Jay E. Bacharach\n(1971), Nigel Harrison (1975), R. A. Sharpe (1979, 1995, 2001),\nRossberg (2012), and Davies (2012). \n\nRudner brought up the type-token distinction in the context of a\ncritique of Lewis’s (1946) idea that a work of art is a\ncontextualized abstract entity. Rudner conjectured that what Lewis had\nin mind in talking about the relationship between an abstract entity\nand its renditions or instances was the type-token relation. This\nconjecture makes sense given that Lewis was one of the first American\nphilosophers to read his way through the Peircean Nachlass,\nwhich he found stored in cartons in the first office he was assigned\nat Harvard. Lewis indeed refers to Peirce at times in his (1946), but\nhe did not endorse Peirce’s theses about the nature of types; nor did\nLewis use the idiom of types and tokens in the passages where he tried\nto identify what he took to be the special character of the relations\nbetween aesthetic essences and their concrete vehicles, one of his\nmain proposals being that some kinds of works of art depend more than\nothers on concrete objects. \n\nStevenson (1957) reached for a type/token distinction in an attempt to\ndisambiguate the intuitively appealing idea that a poem is a written\nor spoken sequence of words. ‘Word’, Stevenson notes, is\nambiguous between the particular instance or token and the type of\nword. While he finds it tempting to rule that the poem is the type (of\nword sequence), Stevenson considers this to be incompatible with\nordinary discourse about literature, as when we use the title of a\nwork to refer to a particular token, saying “Please hand me\nParadise Lost.” Stevenson considers it best to\nallow that the work is either a type or a token, leaving the task of\ndisambiguation to context-sensitive usage. He explicitly rejects\nRené Wellek and Austin Warren’s (1942) Ingarden-inspired\nthesis that a work is an abstract item, namely a stratified system of\nnorms. In order to accommodate the idea that meaning is also\nessential to the kind of thing a poem is, Stevenson uses the term\n‘megatype’ to pick out classes of word sequences having the\nsame meaning, so that a poem is identifiable as a megatype.\nMegatypes, he would appear to believe, are ultimately reducible to\n“a special kind of physical object or event” (1958, 41 n.\n2), but it is not clear how this analysis will proceed: is the\nconjunction of a meaningful text type and the text types of all of its\npast, present, and future faithful translations a physical object or\nevent? \n\nIn an extended criticism of particularist accounts of the\nindividuation and evaluation of works, Meager characterizes a work as\neither a spatiotemporal object or performance that manifests a pattern\nof elements that is the product of a person’s (or group of\npersons’) activity, where the activity was not a matter of\ncopying or servile imitation, and where the object or performance is\nevaluated non-instrumentally. The concept of a work of art, she\ncomments, “operates in a rather special way as a universal\ndefined by a spatio-temporal particular, which may itself therefore be\nregarded as a type-universal” (1958–59, 59). According to\nMeager, the identity of the individual artist is not a factor of work\nindividuation: should two different persons independently author poems\nthat happen to consist in the same sequence of words, they have\nindependently authored the same work, even if their motives,\nintentions, and contexts are strikingly different. \n\nTurning now to Wollheim’s influential application of a\ntype-token distinction (1968, 1980), what is most noteworthy about his\narticulation of the idea that at least some works of art are best\ncategorized as types is the reason he gives for saying that types are\ndifferent from other “generic entities,” and in\nparticular, universals. The relation between a type and its tokens is,\naccording to Wollheim, “more intimate” than the relation\nbetween a universal (e.g., a property) and its instances. Whereas the\nproperty being white is not itself white, all and only those\nproperties that a token has by virtue of its being a token of a given\ntype are “transmitted” to that type as well: as no bit of\ncloth that is not rectangular can be a correctly formed token of the\ntype The Union Jack, it follows that the property of being\nrectangular also belongs to the type The Union Jack. This\nidea is endorsed by Oswald Hanfling (1992, 80–82), Linda Wetzel\n(2009), and others. \n\nThis contention about the “more intimate” relation between\ntypes, tokens, and their instantiations of properties leaves one to\nwonder how Wollheim conceived of both universals and types.  Unlike\nPeirce, he does not hold that the existence of a type depends on that\nof at least one token; Wollheim seems inclined to accept types as a\nspecies of autonomously existing abstract object. Yet if any item that\ninstantiates the property rectangular must be spatial, and if\nevery token of The Union Jack instantiates that property,\nthen it follows from Wollheim’s claim that The Union\nJack is, qua type, rectangular. It would appear to\nfollow from this that the type must be a concrete, spatially located\nentity, since anything that can literally be rectangular must be\nlocated in space. Yet one of the main reasons for going in for the\ntheory of types in the first place was Peirce’s basic\nobservation that while token word inscriptions of ‘the’\nhave their times and places, the word the, qua type,\nhas no location. Is it sound to postulate the existence of an\nautonomous abstraction having spatial or temporal features? \n\nReicher (1998) acknowledges that if works are types, they cannot\nliterally have spatiotemporal properties. With the aim of providing a\nmore accurate restatement of ordinary talk about the perceptible\nqualities of works, she distinguishes between two different modes of\npredication. In an example of a first mode of predication, someone\nsays ‘the table is rectangular’. This is contrasted to a\ndifferent mode whereby we say, for example, ‘this work of art is\ndetermined as [ist bestimmt als] rectangular’. If a\nwork of art has been determined as rectangular, then every realization\nof the work is rectangular. We can perceive a work’s\nrealizations, as these are concrete objects or actions, but strictly\nspeaking, we apprehend [erfassen] but do not perceive the\ntype itself. (For background on this approach, see the entry on\nnonexistent objects.) \n\nGuy Rohrbaugh (2003) argues that even in the case of repeatable works\nsuch as photographs, the category of types does not adequately capture\nat least three fundamental features of works of art: temporality (they\ncome into existence and can cease to exist), temporal flexibility\n(some of their qualities can change over time), and modal flexibility\n(a work could have had properties other than those it actually\nhas). According to Rohrbaugh, type theories cannot accomodate this\nkind of modal flexibility. He proposes instead that works of art\nshould be conceived of as historical individuals that persist through\ntime. \n\nWolsterstorff complains that Wollheim’s thesis about the sharing\nof properties among types and their tokens gives us “no\nillumination” with respect to the pattern of such sharing (1975,\n239). Artistic types and their tokens cannot have all and only the\nsame properties. For this reason Wolterstorff turns to a kind of\n“analogous predication” in which properties attributed to\nthe token are analogously attributed to the type. Suppose a\nperformance or instance of a work has the prescribed or indicated\nproperty, P. The analogous property of the work (qua type or\nkind) is the property: being such that something cannot be a correct\nor proper example of the work without having the property of being\nP. Shifting to the terminology of ‘kinds’ and\n‘examples’, Wolterstorff focuses on properties that are\nnecessary to “properly formed” examples of a kind, where\nthe kind in question is a “norm-kind” that can (but need\nnot) have both improperly and properly formed instances. For example,\nsome seriously flawed attempts to play a difficult piece by Chopin are\nnonetheless performances of that work, even though they lack qualities\nthat a proper or a good instance of the work would have. This proposal\nis meant to accomodate the many cases where significantly different\nartistic and aesthetic properties figure within the occurrences or\nperformances of one and the same work (on this theme, see also Walton\n1977). \n\nWolterstorff accepts the thesis that works of art neither come into\nnor go out of existence (1980, 88–89). A kind, K, exists\nif and only if the correlated property, k, exists. With regard\nto the existence of properties, Wolterstorff’s initial view\n(1970) was that for any property, being-f, this property\nexists just in case either something is-f or something is\nnot-f. Criticisms (John Perry 1974) involving Russell’s\nparadox of unexemplified properties led him to qualify this\n“general predicate entailment principle.” \n\nWolterstorff holds that the sequences of sounds and words of which\nmusical and literary works are made up exist everlastingly. What the\nartist does in creating a work, then, is to make it the case that a\n“preexistent kind becomes a work—specifically, a\nwork of his” (1980, 89). Wolterstorff’s idea,\nthen, is that a composer can select but not create a sound pattern or\ntype of sound-occurrence. Although the latter is an entity that\nalready exists, it is not a musical work unless some composer has\ndetermined and perhaps recorded its correctness conditions\nqua work. Wolterstorff remarks that the composing of a\nmusical work is similar to the inventing of a game (1980, 63). \nOne family of views on the ontological status of works of art finds\nits orientation in a longstanding conception of the arts in\ngeneral. The word ‘art’ derives from the Latin\n’ars’, which is often taken as translating the Greek term\n‘technē’, which covered various sorts of practical\ncapacities or powers. The word derived from the Indo-European root\n‘tek’, meaning to put together the woodwork of a house; a\n‘tekton’ was a carpenter (Angier 2010, 1). Carpentry is\nsomething that cannot be done without some skill, and to become good\nat the art of carpentry requires training and practice. To exercise an\nart or craft is to activate a power to bring things about that\notherwise would not have happened. In this vein Aristotle declares in\nhis Metaphysics that “all arts, i.e. all productive\nforms of knowledge are potentialities; they are principles of change\nin another thing or in the artist himself considered as other”\n(Met. 1046a36–1046b4). In Nicomachean Ethics\nhe remarks that “since building is an art and is essentially a\nreasoned state of capacity to make, and there is neither any art that\nis not such a state nor such a state that is not an art), art\nis identical with a state of capacity to make, involving a true course\nof reasoning” (Nic. Eth., 1140a6–1140a11). \nThat the arts are a matter of the rational production and judgement of\nartifacts was widely accepted by medieval thinkers (for background,\nsee Eco 1988, 164–165). For example, in the discussion of\niconoclasm and idolatry in the Opus Caroli regis contra\nsynodum (ca. 794), Theodulf of Orléans characterized\npictures as manufacta (Noble 2009, 227, 347). Claims of this\nsort stood in opposition to Byzantine beliefs in such things\nas acheiropoeitoi, or miraculous sacred images not created by\nmortal hands.   \n\nNo doubt with Aristotle in mind, in his Summa Theologica\n(1912, I-II, 57, 4c) Thomas Aquinas defined ‘art’ as right reason in\nthe making of things (ars est recta ratio factibilium). In\n(1744, 7) James Harris identified art as “an habitual power in\nman of becoming the cause of some effect, according to a system of\nvarious and well-approved precepts.” Kant in turn identified a\nwork or opus as the product of a doing [Tun]\n(facere), to which he contrasted the effects of nature, such\nas a beehive. Only what is the product of the exercise of a capacity\nto choose [eine Willkür] is art (2000 [1790], 182–183,\nparagraph 43). (For commentary on Kant’s definitions of art and\nfine art, see Paul Guyer 1997.) Bolzano’s (1849) essay on the\nnature and classification of works of art similarly begins with an\nemphasis on the necessity of the artist’s intentional activity\nto the creation of a work. Various philosophers have more recently\nclassified works of art (or at least some works of fine art) as\nartifacts; examples include Marcia Eaton (1969), Gary Iseminger\n(1973), Denis Dutton (1979), Risto Hilpinen (1992, 1993), Thomasson\n(1999), and Levinson (2007) (for background, see the entry on\nartifacts). The next section is devoted to Levinson’s influential\nproposal. \nLevinson advocates a “contextualism” in aesthetics (2005),\nwhich is not to be confounded with the approach defended by Pepper\n(1937a, 1968, 1970) under the same label. In his (1980a, 1990)\nLevinson sets forth and defends an account of “paradigm musical\nworks,” i.e. fully notated compositions within Western\nculture. His proposal is motivated by the attempt to meet what he\ntakes to be three salient requirements on an adequate ontology of\nworks of this sort: creatability, fine individuation, and the\ninclusion of performance means. \n\nThe first requirement specifies that “Musical works must be such\nthat they do not exist prior to the composer’s compositional activity,\nbut are brought into existence by that activity” (1980,\n68). Like Wolterstorff, Levinson allows that all possible sound-types,\nand patterns and sequences thereof, preexist anyone’s compositional\nactivities. The creatability requirement must be compatible with this\nassumption, he maintains. The claim is not, then, that composers can\nbring musical structures into existence; what they can do, however, is\n“indicate” a structural type along with a performance\nmeans or manner of generating instances or tokens of sound sequences\nof that type. A musical work is, then, a relational entity of the sort\n“sound structure and performance-means as indicated by\nartist X at time t.”. This sort of abstract\nitem, Levinson writes, “does not preexist the activity of\ncomposition and is thus capable of being created” (1980a, 79;\ncf. John Andrew Fisher 1991). Entities of this sort, it seems, only\ncome into existence through the actual event of indication performed\nby a person (or persons) in some context. Terms figuring alongside\n‘indicate’ in Levinson’s descriptions of what the artist\ndoes with the abstract object include ‘discover’,\n‘choose’, and ‘demonstrate’ (1990). Levinson\nsays more about how he understands the difference between ordinary and\nartistic indication in his (2012). \n\nLevinson’s fine individuation requirement springs from the intuition\nthat if two composers were to indicate the same sound-structure, they\nwould not thereby generate the same musical work. The contrary\nintuition had been forwarded by Meager (1958–59, 57–58) and\nWolterstorff (1975, 248); it was criticized in Walton (1977) and\nSavile (1971). Levinson entertains the possibility that the identity\nof the composer is not essential to the individuation of works;\nperhaps it is at least logically possible for a work to be composed by\na person other than the one who actually did so. Levinson explores the\nthesis that something like sameness of musical-historical context is a\nconstraint sufficient to satisfy the requirement of fine-grained\nindividuation. \nLevinson proposes, then, that some musical works may be classified as\n“initiated types,” that is, types that are brought into\nbeing by an intentional action of indication performed upon a pure\nstructure. With regard to works of visual art, Levinson (1996) defends\nthe idea that at least some such works are physical objects as\nintended by the artist for a certain regard or treatment. The work is\nthe relational entity comprised of the object or structure and the\nartist’s action in a context. \nCurrie objects that Levinson’s ontological category, structure as\nindicated-by-artist at time t, is metaphysically obscure\n(1989, 58). Fleming discovered penicillin, but do we believe that in\nso doing he also created the entity,\npenicillin-as-discovered-by-Fleming? Levinson is explicitly committed\nto the idea that when the artist indicates or discovers or chooses an\nabstract structure, “something further comes into\nexistence,” namely, an initiated type (1990, 262). Currie’s\npoint is that if this is allowed, various unwanted ontological\ncommitments follow. A related criticism raised by Dodd (2000),\nPredelli (2001), and Alward (2004) is that indicating is not really a\nmatter of creating, and if this is correct, it follows that Levinson’s\nproposal does not satisfy a sufficiently robust version of the first\nof his three requirements on an adequate ontology of the relevant\nsorts of works. \nCurrie also raises the objection that Levinson’s account does not\nindividuate works adequately; this objection has been further pursued\nby David Davies (2004), and by Matheson and Caplan (2007). Lamarque\n(2010) contends that there is an indeterminacy as to which tokens are\nof a given indicated type. \nIn response to James Anderson’s (1985) suggestion that Levinson’s\nproposal could be amplified with reference to Wolterstorff’s ideas\nabout norm-kinds, Levinson (1990) expresses reservations about the\nlatter, but adds that the notion that the artist makes certain\nfeatures normative for a work helps to explain in what indicating a\nstructure consists. \nVarious philosophers have explored the idea that works should be\nclassified as actions or performances as opposed to the products or\nobjects that may result from such actions. Croce, Collingwood, and\nDewey are early and highly influential examples. In a remarkable\nreview of Dewey’s aesthetics, Croce makes a list of familiar\nideas to be found in Dewey’s work. One of these ideas, which he\nsays was formulated much earlier in Italy, is that “there are\nnot artistic ‘things’, but only an artistic doing, an\nartistic producing” (1948, 205). Jeffrey Maitland (1975)\nsimilarly suggests that the work of art is a “doing”, but\nalso declares that a work is a “performative presence.”\nDenis Dutton writes that “As performances, works of art\nrepresent the ways in which artists solve problems, overcome\nobstacles, make do with available materials.” (1979, 305). He\nadds in the same context that “the work of art has a human\norigin, and must be understood as such.” \n\nSparshott (1980, 1982) conceives of a work as a performance, and more\nspecifically, as an action when it is conceived in a certain way,\nnamely, as the establishment of a design. Work identity is determined\nby both the nature of this design and the type of action that yielded\nit: same design and origin, same work.  Sparshott’s evocation of\na unity of outcome and agency is complicated, however, by the fact\nthat he thinks in terms of reconstructed or idealized, nonfactual\nartistic intentions, as opposed to the actual intentions and actions\nof the artist or artists responsible for the production of a\n“system of qualities.” \n\nCurrie (1989) proposes that all artworks belong to the category of\naction types. Works are types of events, then, and events are said by\nCurrie to be a “natural ontological category.” Although\nCurrie says he wants to stay neutral on issues pertaining to the\nnature and individuation of events, he at least provisionally works\nwith Jaegwon Kim’s (1976) conception of events as property\nexemplifications by an object or substance (or ordered n-tuple\nof objects/substances) at a time. As types, works could not themselves\nliterally be events, and Currie’s event-types are individuated\nin ways that abstract from the “constitutive substance”\nfiguring within Kim’s basically Aristotelian perspective on\nevents. \n\nMore specifically, Currie’s proposal is that a work is an action\ntype of the form: an agent, A, discovers a structure, s,\nvia a heuristic path, H, at a time, t. \n\nCurrie allows that the artist does not create the work of art.  Nor\ndoes the artist discover it. The artist can discover a preexisting\nabstract artistic structure, but the work is an action type that the\nartist “performs” in so doing. \n\nCurrie explains that the heuristic path is the “way in which the\nartist arrived at the final product.” Neither a particular agent\nnor a specific time is essential to the action type that is the work\nof art: someone else could discover the same structure at a different\ntime yet instantiate the same work. Currie conjectures, for example,\nthat if “Picasso’s twin on ‘Twin Earth’\nproduces a canvas indistinguishable from\nPicasso’s Guernica, and if he does so in the same way,\nthen Guernica and Twin Guernica are instances of the\nsame work” (1989, 9). Currie also introduces a similar\nconjecture involving Beethoven, twin Beethoven, and twin tokens of the\nHammerklavier sonata. \n\nWolterstorff (1992) and Levinson (1992) complain that a\ncounterintuitive implication of Currie’s proposal is that one\ncannot read a literary work. Levinson (1992) takes up the question of\nwork individuation and asks whether Beethoven and twin Beethoven\nreally make the same works, even though they act within qualitatively\nidentical cultures and come up with tokens of the same artistic\nstructure via qualitatively identical paths. \n\nQuestions have been raised (e.g., by Levinson 1992 and David Davies\n2004) about Currie’s Lakatos-inspired notion of the\nartist’s heuristic path, beginning with the obvious query as to\nwhat is and is not included in the “way” the artist\ndiscovers the structure. Currie allows that the path can include facts\nunknown to the artist if they are deemed relevant to the appreciation\nof his or her achievement. For example, even if Virginia Woolf did not\nknow of Marcel Proust’s work when she wrote Jacob’s\nRoom, she could “in principle” have known about it,\nand so Proust’s prior inventions were part of her path and are\nrelevant to our understanding of Woolf’s achievement.  Currie\nacknowledges that his notion of a heuristic path is vague, and he\nentertains the possibility that describing the heuristic of a work\n“starts to look like writing the history of the universe”\n(1989, 72). Yet he optimistically predicts that there “will be\nwide agreement about how the idea is to be applied in particular\ncases” (1989, 73). More specifically, he indicates that\n“case studies” in the analysis of such heuristics can be\nfound in Michael Baxandall’s (1985). \n\nIn his proposal for an alternative to contextualist ontologies of art,\nDavid Davies (2004, 2005) proposes that works of art are best\nclassified, not as indicated structures or as action types, but as\naction tokens. A work of art, then, is a ‘doing’ or\ngenerative performance. Davies further analyzes the latter as a\nsequence of “motivated manipulations of a vehicular medium\nthrough which a particular focus of appreciation is specified”\n(2005a, 75). With regard to the bedeviled question of which factors in\nthe historical context of a work’s creation do and do not\ndetermine the identity of the work (a question that is taken to be\ndistinct from the question as to which factors are in some broad sense\nrelevant to the work’s understanding and appreciation), Davies\nidentifies what he calls the artist’s “primary\nmotivation,” which governs activities that specify an artistic\nvehicle that articulates a given artistic content. It is these\nart-content-articulating manipulations of artistic vehicles that\nqualify as elements in the performance that is identified with the\nwork. For example, whether an artist’s intentional ingestion of\na drug during the making of the “focus of appreciation” or\nproduct of the generative performance is to be counted as part of the\nwork depends, then, on whether this action is part of a manipulation\nof an artistic vehicle effectively designed to articulate some aspect\nof the work’s content. \n\nDilworth (2005b) objects that Davies’s basic contention to the\neffect that works are action tokens is incompatible with his claim\nthat works, conceived of as a particular generative performance, have\na kind of “modal flexibility,” which means that the same\nwork could have had different properties (e.g., it could have been\ncreated a few minutes earlier or later, or in a significantly\ndifferent art-historical context). Davies argues that his performance\ntheory, unlike such rivals as the indicated structure theory, is\ncompatible with a work-relative modality. For an informative\ndiscussion of this topic, see Matheson and Caplan (2008). \n\nSome critics of Davies’ account (Kania 2005, Stecker 2005) contend\nthat he provides insufficient grounds for the adoption of a highly\nrevisionary ontological doctrine that gives the lie to countless\nordinary statements about works of art, such as “the\nMona Lisa can be seen at the Louvre.” This criticism\nechoes Mary McCarthy’s remark in response to Harold\nRosenberg’s proposal that action paintings are not pictures but\n“events”: “You cannot hang an event on a wall, only\na picture” (Rosenberg 1962, 5). Davies (or the proponent of any\nother ontological account that is incompatible with prevalent\npronouncements in ordinary language) may respond that the\nphilosopher’s goal is not to ratify all casual and unreflective\nutterances about the arts, but to articulate a cogent (and possibly\nrevisionary) metaphysics. Davies in fact contends that his proposal is\nmeant to obey a “pragmatic constraint” to the effect that\n“Artworks must be conceived ontologically in such a way as to\naccord with those features of our critical and appreciative practice\nupheld on rational reflection” (2004, 23). This constraint is\npart of a larger argument that also rests on the following\n“epistemological” premise: “Rational reflection upon\nour critical and appreciative practice confirms that certain sorts of\nproperties, actual or modal, are rightly ascribed to what are termed\n‘works’ in that practice, or that our practice rightly\nindividuates what are termed ‘works’ in a certain\nway” (2004, 23). \n\nStecker (2009) argues that Davies’s epistemological argument\ndoes not justify settling on the performance theory or any of the\nother rival ontological proposals. Stecker holds that the pragmatic,\nreferential core of our talk about musical works requires them to be\naudible, repeatable, and performable. This finding, he contends, is\ncompatible with contextualism, but not with Davies’s own\nproposal. \n\nGiven that the practices in the spheres of art are contradictory,\nchanging, and influenced by cacophonous theorizing, the practices\nalone cannot tell us which aspects of practice are and are not\nindicative of reliable answers to art-ontological\nqueries. Consequently it is fair to ask how a philosopher’s rational\nreflection on practice can lead to accurate answers to art-ontological\nquestions (Livingston 2005b). Two salient issues in this regard are\nhow sufficient evidence about art-related attitudes and behavior is to\nbe gathered by philosophers, and how this evidence can be interpreted\nin such a manner that it provides reliable support for general\nontological claims. Art-ontologists need a reliable, principled method\nwith which to select and interpret the practices that are meant to\nsupport their theories.","contact.mail":"pl@ln.edu.hk","contact.domain":"ln.edu.hk"}]
