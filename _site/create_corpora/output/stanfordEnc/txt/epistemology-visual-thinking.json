This entry discusses\npotential roles of visual thinking in proving and in discovering, with\nsome examples, and epistemic difficulties and limitations are\nconsidered. Also discussed is the bearing of epistemic uses of visual\nrepresentations on the application of the a priori–a\nposteriori distinction to mathematical knowledge. A final section\nlooks briefly at how visual means can aid comprehension and deepen\nunderstanding of proofs.\n\nVisual thinking is a feature of mathematical practice across many\nsubject areas and at many levels. It is so pervasive that the question\nnaturally arises: does visual thinking in mathematics have any\nepistemically significant roles? A positive answer begets further\nquestions. Can we rationally arrive at a belief with the generality\nand necessity characteristic of mathematical theorems by attending to\nspecific diagrams or images? If visual thinking contributes to warrant\nfor believing a mathematical conclusion, must the outcome be an\nempirical belief? How, if at all can visual thinking contribute to\nunderstanding abstract mathematical subject matter? Visual thinking includes thinking with external visual\nrepresentations (e.g., diagrams, symbol arrays, kinematic computer\nimages) and thinking with internal visual imagery; often the\ntwo are used in combination, as when we are required to visually\nimagine a certain spatial transformation of an object represented by a\ndiagram on paper or on screen. Almost always (and perhaps always)\nvisual thinking in mathematics is used in conjunction with non-visual\nthinking. Possible epistemic roles include contributions to evidence,\nproof, discovery, understanding and grasp of concepts. The kinds and\nthe uses of visual thinking in mathematics are numerous and diverse.\nThis entry will deal with some of the topics in this area that have\nreceived attention and omit others. Among the omissions is the\npossible explanatory role of visual representations in\nmathematics. The topic of explanation within pure mathematics is\ntricky and best dealt with separately; for this an excellent starting\nplace is the entry on\n explanation in mathematics\n (Mancosu 2011). Two other omissions are the\ndevelopment of logic diagrams (Euler, Venn, Pierce and Shin) and the\nnature and use of geometric diagrams in Euclid’s\nElements, both of which are well treated in the entry\n diagrams (Shin et al. 2013).  The\nfocus here is on visual thinking generally, which includes thinking\nwith symbol arrays as well as with diagrams; there will be no attempt\nhere to formulate a criterion for distinguishing between symbolic and\ndiagrammatic thinking. However, the use of visual thinking in proving\nand in various kinds of discovery will be covered in what\nfollows. Discussions of some related questions and some studies of\nhistorical cases not considered here are to be found in the collection\nDiagrams in Mathematics: History and Philosophy (Mumma and\nPanza 2012). “Mathematics can achieve nothing by concepts alone but\nhastens at once to intuition” wrote Kant (1781/9: A715/B743),\nbefore describing the geometrical construction in Euclid’s proof\nof the angle sum theorem (Euclid, Book 1, proposition 32). In a review\nof 1816 Gauss echoes Kant:\n \nThe word “intuition” here translates the German\n“Anschauung”, a word which applies to visual\nimagination and perception, though it also has more general uses. By the late 19th century a different view had emerged,\nat least in foundational areas. In a celebrated text giving the first\nrigorous axiomatization of projective geometry, Pasch wrote:\n“the theorem is only truly demonstrated if the proof is\ncompletely independent of the figure” (Pasch 1882), a view\nexpressed also by Hilbert in writing on the foundations of geometry\n(Hilbert 1894). A negative attitude to visual thinking was not\nconfined to geometry.  Dedekind, for example, wrote of an overpowering\nfeeling of dissatisfaction with appeal to geometric intuitions in\nbasic infinitesimal analysis (Dedekind 1872, Introduction). The\ngrounds were felt to be uncertain, the concepts employed vague and\nunclear. When such concepts were replaced by precisely defined\nalternatives without allusions to space, time or motion, our intuitive\nexpectations turned out to be unreliable (Hahn 1933). In some quarters this view turned into a general disdain for visual\nthinking in mathematics: “In the best books” Russell\npronounced “there are no figures at all” (Russell 1901).\nAlthough this attitude was opposed by a few mathematicians, notably\nKlein (1893), others took it to heart. Landau, for example, wrote a\ncalculus textbook without a single diagram (Landau 1934). But the\npredominant view was not so extreme: thinking in terms of figures was\nvalued as a means of facilitating grasp of formulae and linguistic\ntext, but only reasoning expressed by means of formulae and text could\nbear any epistemological weight. By the late 20th century the mood had swung back in\nfavour of visualization: Mancosu (2005) provides an excellent survey.\nSome books advertise their defiance of anti-visual puritanism in their\ntitles, for example Visual Geometry and Topology (Fomenko\n1994) and Visual Complex Analysis (Needham 1997); mathematics\neducators turn their attention to pedagogical uses of visualization\n(Zimmerman and Cunningham 1991); the use of computer-generated imagery\nbegins to bear fruit at research level (Hoffman 1987; Palais 1999),\nand diagrams find their way into research papers in abstract fields:\nsee for example the papers on higher dimensional category theory by\nJoyal et al. (1996), Leinster (2004) and Lauda (2005, Other Internet\nResources). But attitudes\nto the epistemology of visual thinking remain mixed. The discussion is\nmostly concerned with the role of diagrams in proofs. In some cases, it is claimed, a picture alone is a proof (Brown\n1999: ch. 3). But that view is rare. Even the editor of Proofs\nwithout Words: Exercises in Visual Thinking, writes “Of\ncourse, ‘proofs without words’ are not really\nproofs” (Nelsen 1993: vi). Expressions of the other extreme are\nrare but can be found:   [the diagram] has no proper place in the proof as\nsuch. For the proof is a syntactic object consisting only of sentences\narranged in a finite and inspectable array. (Tennant 1986)\n Between the extremes we find the view that, even if no picture\nalone is a proof, visual representations can have a non-superfluous\nrole in reasoning that constitutes a proof. (This is not to deny that\nthere may be another proof of the same conclusion which does not involve\nany visual representation.) Geometric diagrams, graphs and maps, all\ncarry information. Taking valid deductive reasoning to be the reliable\nextraction of information from information already obtained, Barwise\nand Etchemendy (1996:4) pose the following question: Why cannot the\nrepresentations composing a proof be visual as well as linguistic? The\nsole reason for denying this role to visual representations is the\nthought that, with the possible exception of very restricted cases,\nvisual thinking is unreliable, hence cannot contribute to proof. Is\nthat right? Our concern here is thinking through the steps in a proof, either\nfor the first time (a first successful attempt to construct a proof)\nor following a given proof. Clearly we want to distinguish between\nvisual thinking which merely accompanies the process of thinking\nthrough the steps in a proof and visual thinking which is essential to\nthe process.  This is not always straightforward as a proof can be\npresented in different ways. How different can distinct presentations\nbe and yet be presentations of the same proof? There is no\ncontext-invariant answer to this. Often mathematicians are happy to\nregard two presentations as presenting the same proof if the central\nidea is the same in both cases. But if one’s main concern is\nwith what is involved in thinking through a proof, its central idea is\nnot enough to individuate it: the overall structure, the sequence of\nsteps and perhaps some other factors affecting the cognitive processes\ninvolved will be relevant. Once individuation of proofs has been settled, we can distinguish\nbetween replaceable thinking and superfluous thinking, where these\nattributions are understood as relative to a given argument or proof.\nIn the process of thinking through a proof, a given part of the\nthinking is replaceable if thinking of some other kind could\nstand in place of the given part in a process that would count as\nthinking through the same proof. A given part of the thinking is\nsuperfluous if its excision without replacement would be a\nprocess of thinking through the same proof. Superfluous thinking may\nbe extremely valuable in facilitating grasp of the proof text and in\nenabling one to understand the idea underlying the proof steps; but it\nis not necessary for thinking through the proof.  It is uncontentious that the visual thinking involved in symbol\nmanipulations, for example in following the “algebraic”\nsteps of proofs of basic lemmas about groups, can be essential, that\nis neither superfluous nor replaceable. The worry is about thinking\nvisually with diagrams, where “diagram” is used widely to\ninclude all non-symbolic visual representations. Let us agree that\nthere can be superfluous diagrammatic thinking in thinking through a\nproof. This leaves several possibilities. The negative view stated earlier that diagrams can have no role in\nproof entails claim (a). The idea behind (a) is that, because\ndiagrammatic reasoning is unreliable, if a process of thinking through\nan argument contains some non-superfluous diagrammatic thinking, that\nprocess lacks the epistemic security to be a case of thinking through\na proof. This view, claim (a) in particular, is threatened by cases in which\nthe reliability of the diagrammatic thinking is demonstrated\nnon-visually. The clearest kind of example would be provided by a\nformal system which has diagrams in place of formulas among its\nsyntactic objects, and types of inter-diagram transition for inference\nrules. Suppose you take in such a formal system and an interpretation\nof it, and then think through a proof of the system’s soundness\nwith respect to that interpretation; suppose you then inspect a\nsequence of diagrams, checking along the way that it constitutes a\nderivation in the system; suppose finally that you recover the\ninterpretation to reach a conclusion. (The order is unimportant: one\ncan go through the derivation first and then follow the soundness\nproof.) That entire process would constitute thinking through a proof\nof the conclusion; and the diagrammatic thinking involved would not be\nsuperfluous. Shin et al. (2013) report that formal diagrammatic systems of logic\nand geometry have been proven to be sound. People have indeed followed\nproofs in these systems. That is enough to refute claim (a), the claim\nthat all diagrammatic thinking in thinking through a proof is\nsuperfluous. For a concrete example, Figure 1\npresents a derivation of Euclid’s first theorem, that on any\nstraight line segment an equilateral triangle is constructible, in a\nformal diagrammatic system of a part of Euclidean geometry (Miller\n2001). Figure 1 What about Tennant’s claim that a proof is “a syntactic\nobject consisting only of sentences” as opposed to diagrams? A\nproof is never a syntactic object. A formal derivation on its\nown is a syntactic object but not a proof. Without an interpretation\nof the language of the formal system the end-formula of the derivation\nsays nothing; and so nothing is proved. Without a demonstration of the\nsystem’s soundness with respect to the interpretation, one may\nlack sufficient reason to believe that all derivable conclusions are\ntrue. A formal derivation plus an interpretation and\nsoundness proof can be a proof of the derived conclusion, but that\nwhole package is not a syntactic object. Moreover, the part of the\nproof which really is a syntactic object, the formal derivation, need\nnot consist solely of sentences; it can consist of diagrams. With claim (a) disposed of, consider again claim (b) that, while\nnot all diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking through a proof\nis superfluous, all non-superfluous diagrammatic thinking will be\nreplaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking\nthrough that same proof. The visual thinking in following the proof of\nEuclid’s first theorem using Miller’s formal system\nconsists in going through a sequence of diagrams and at each step\nseeing that the next diagram results from a permitted alteration of\nthe previous diagram. It is clear that in a process that counts as\nthinking through this proof, the diagrammatic thinking is\nneither superfluous nor replaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking. That\nknocks out (b), leaving only (c): some thinking that involves a\ndiagram in thinking through a proof is neither superfluous nor\nreplaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking (without changing the\nproof). Mathematical practice almost never proceeds by way of formal\nsystems. Outside the context of formal diagrammatic systems, the use\nof diagrams is widely felt to be unreliable. A diagram can be\nunfaithful to the described construction: it may represent something\nwith a property that is ruled out by the description, or without a\nproperty that is demanded by the description. This is exemplified by\ndiagrams in the famous argument for the proposition that all triangles\nare isosceles: the meeting point of an angle bisector and the\nperpendicular bisector of the opposite side is represented as falling\ninside the triangle, when it has to be outside (Rouse Ball 1939;\nMaxwell 1959).  Errors of this sort are comparatively rare, usually\navoidable with a modicum of care, and not inherent in the nature of\ndiagrams; so they do not warrant a general charge of\nunreliability.  The major sort of error is unwarranted generalisation.  Typically\ndiagrams (and other non-verbal visual representations) do not\nrepresent their objects as having a property that is actually ruled\nout by the intention or specification of the object to be\nrepresented. But diagrams very frequently do represent their objects\nas having properties that, though not ruled out by the specification,\nare not demanded by it. Verbal descriptions can be discrete, in that\nthey supply no more information than is needed. But visual\nrepresentations are typically indiscrete, in that they supply too much\ndetail. This is often unavoidable, because for many properties or\nkinds \\(F\\), a visual representation cannot represent something as\nbeing \\(F\\) without representing it as being \\(F\\) in a particular\nway. Any diagram of a triangle, for instance, must represent it\nas having three acute angles or as having just two acute angles, even\nif neither property is required by the specification, as would be the\ncase if the specification were “Let ABC be a triangle”. As\na result there is a danger that in using a diagram to reason about an\narbitrary instance of class \\(K\\), we will unwittingly rely on a\nfeature represented in the diagram that is not common to all instances\nof the class \\(K\\). Thus the risk of unwarranted generalisation is a\ndanger inherent in the use of many diagrams. Indiscretion of diagrams is not confined to geometrical\nfigures. The dot or pebble diagrams of ancient mathematics used to\nconvince one of elementary truths of number theory necessarily display\nparticular numbers of dots, though the truths are general. Here is an\nexample, used to justify the formula for the \\(n\\)th\ntriangular number, i.e., the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive\nintegers. Figure 2 The conclusion drawn is that the sum of integers from 1 to \\(n\\) is\n\\((n \\times n+1)/2\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\), but the diagram\npresents the case for \\(n = 6\\). We can perhaps avoid representing a\nparticular number of dots when we merely imagine a display of the\nrelevant kind; or if a particular number is represented, our\nexperience may not make us aware of the number—just as, when one\nimagines the sky on a starry night, for no particular number \\(k\\) are\nwe aware that exactly \\(k\\) stars are represented. Even so, there is\nlikely to be some extra specificity. For example, in imagining an\narray of dots of the form just illustrated, one is unlikely to imagine\njust two columns of three dots, the rectangular array for \\(n =\n2\\). Typically the subject will be aware of imagining an array with\nmore than two columns.  This entails that an image is likely to have\nunintended exclusions. In this case it would exclude the three-by-two\narray. An image of a triangle representing all angles as acute would\nexclude triangles with an obtuse angle or a right angle. The danger is\nthat the visual reasoning will not be valid for the cases that are\nunintentionally excluded by the visual representation, with the result\nthat the step to the conclusion is an unwarranted generalisation. What should we make of this? First, let us note that in a few cases\nthe image or diagram will not be over-specific. When in geometry all\ninstances of the relevant class are congruent to one another, for\ninstance all circles or all squares, the image or diagram will not be\nover-specific for a generalisation about that class; so there will be\nno unintended exclusions and no danger of unwarranted generalisation.\nHere then are possibilities for reliable visual thinking in\nproving. To get clear about the other cases, where there is a\ndanger of over generalizing, it helps to look at generalisation in\nordinary non-visual reasoning. Schematically put, in reasoning about\nthings of kind \\(K\\), once we have shown that from certain premisses\nit follows that such-and-such a condition is true of arbitrary\ninstance \\(c\\), we can validly infer from those same premisses that\nthat condition is true of all \\(K\\)s, with the proviso that neither\nthe condition nor any premiss mentions \\(c\\). The proviso is required,\nbecause if a premiss or the condition does mention \\(c\\), the\nreasoning may depend on a property of \\(c\\) that is not shared by all\nother \\(K\\)s and so the generalisation would be unsafe. For a trivial\nexample consider a step from “\\(x = c\\)” to\n“\\(\\forall x [x = c]\\)”. A question we face is whether, in order to come to know\nthe truth of a conclusion by following an argument involving\ngeneralisation on an arbitrary instance (a.k.a. universal\ngeneralisation, or universal quantifier introduction), the thinking\nmust include a conscious, explicit check that the proviso is met. It\nis clearly not enough that the proviso is in fact met. For in that\ncase it might just be the thinker’s good luck that the proviso\nis met; hence the thinker would not know that the generalisation is\nvalid and so would not have genuinely thought through the proof at\nthat step. This leaves two options. The strict option is that without a\nconscious, explicit check one has not really thought through the\nproof.  The relaxed option is that one can properly think\nthrough the proof without checking that the proviso is met, but only\nif one is sensitive to the potential error and would detect it in\notherwise similar arguments. For then one is not just lucky that the\nproviso is met. Being sensitive in this context consists in being\nalert to dependence on features of the arbitrary instance not shared\nby all members of the class of generalisation, a state produced by a\ncombination of past experience and current vigilance. Without\ncompelling reason to prefer one of these options, decisions on what is\nto count as proving or following a proof must be conditional.  How does all this apply to generalizing from visual thinking about\nan arbitrary instance? Take the example of the visual route to the\nformula for triangular numbers using the diagram of Figure 2. The diagram reveals that the formula holds\nfor the 6th triangular number. The generalisation to all\ntriangular numbers is justified only if the visuo-spatial method used\nis applicable to the \\(n\\)th triangular number for all\npositive integers \\(n\\), that is, provided that the method used does\nnot depend on a property not shared by all positive integers. A\nconscious, explicit check that this proviso is met requires making\nexplicit the method exemplified for 6 and proving that the method is\napplicable for all positive integers in place of 6. (For a similar\nidea in the context of automating visual arguments, see Jamnik\n2001). This is not done in practice when thinking visually, and so if\nwe accept the strict option for thinking through a proof involving\ngeneralisation, we would have to accept that the visual route to the\nformula for triangular numbers does not amount to thinking through a\nproof of it; and the same would apply to the familiar visual routes to\nother general positive integer formulas, such as that \\(n^2 =\\) the\nsum of the first \\(n\\) odd numbers. But what if the strict option for proving by generalisation on an\narbitrary instance is too strict, and the relaxed option is right?\nWhen arriving at the formula in the visual way indicated, one does not\npay attention to the fact that the visual display represents the\nsituation for the 6th triangular number; it is as if the\nmind had somehow extracted a general schema of visual reasoning from\nexposure to the particular case, and had then proceeded to reason\nschematically, converting a schematic result into a universal\nproposition. What is required, on the relaxed option, is sensitivity\nto the possibility that the schema is not applicable to all positive\nintegers; one must be so alert to ways a schema of the given kind can\nfall short of universal applicability that if one had been presented\nwith a schema that did fall short, one would have detected the\nfailure.  In the example at hand, the schema of visual reasoning involves at\nthe start taking a number \\(k\\) to be represented by a column of \\(k\\)\ndots, thence taking the triangular array of \\(n\\) columns to represent\nthe sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers, thence taking that array\ncombined with an inverted copy to make a rectangular array of \\(n\\)\ncolumns of \\(n+1\\) dots. For a schema starting this way to be\nuniversally applicable, it must be possible, given any positive\ninteger \\(n\\), for the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers to be\nrepresented in the form of a triangular array, so that combined with\nan inverted copy one gets a rectangular array. This actually fails at\nthe extreme case: \\(n = 1\\). The formula \\((n.(n + 1))/2\\) holds for\nthis case; but that is something we know by substituting\n“1” for the variable in the formula, not by the visual\nmethod indicated. That method cannot be applied to \\(n = 1\\), because\na single dot does not form a triangular array, and combined with a\ncopy it does not form a rectangular array. But we can check that the\nmethod works for all positive integers after the first, using visual\nreasoning to assure ourselves that it works for 2 and that if the\nmethod works for \\(k\\) it works for \\(k+1\\). Together with this\nreflective thinking, the visual thinking sketched earlier constitutes\nfollowing a proof of the formula for the \\(n\\)th triangular\nnumber for all integers \\(n > 1\\), at least if the relaxed view of\nthinking through a proof is correct. Similar conclusions hold in the\ncase of other “dot” arguments (Giaquinto 1993, 2007:\nch. 8). So in some cases when the visual representation carries\nunwanted detail, the danger of over-generalisation in visual reasoning\ncan be overcome. But the fact that this is frequently missed by commentators\nsuggests that the required sensitivity is often absent. Missing an\nuntypical case is a common hazard in attempts at visual proving. A\nwell-known example is the proof of Euler’s formula \\(V - E + F =\n2\\) for polyhedra by “removing triangles” of a\ntriangulated planar projection of a polyhedron. One is easily\nconvinced by the thinking, but only because the polyhedra we normally\nthink of are convex, while the exceptions are not convex. But it is\nalso easy to miss a case which is not untypical or extreme when\nthinking visually. An example is Cauchy’s attempted proof\n(Cauchy 1813) of the claim that if a convex polygon is transformed\ninto another polygon keeping all but one of the sides constant, then\nif some or all of the internal angles at the vertices increase, the\nremaining side increases, while if some or all of the internal angles\nat the vertices decrease, the remaining side decreases.  The argument\nproceeds by considering what happens when one transforms a polygon by\nincreasing (or decreasing) angles, angle by angle. But in a trapezoid,\nchanging a single angle can turn a convex polygon into a concave\npolygon, and this invalidates the argument (Lyusternik 1963). The frequency of such mistakes indicates that visual arguments\n(other than symbol manipulations) often lack the transparency required\nfor proof. Even when a visual argument is in fact sound, its soundness\nmay not be clear, in which case the argument is not a way of\nproving the truth of the conclusion, though it may be a way\nof discovering it. But this is consistent with the claim that visual\nnon-symbolic thinking can be (and often is) part of a way of proving\nsomething. An example from knot theory will substantiate the modal part of\nthis claim. To present the example, we need some background\ninformation, which will be given with a minimum of technical\ndetail. A knot is a tame closed non-self-intersecting curve in\nEuclidean 3-space. In other words, knots are just the tame curves in Euclidean 3-space\nwhich are homeomorphic to a circle. The word “tame” here\nstands for a property intended to rule out certain pathological cases,\nsuch as curves with infinitely nested knotting. There is more than one\nway of making this mathematically precise, but we have no need for\nthese details. A knot has a specific geometric shape, size and\naxis-relative position. Now imagine it to be made of flexible yet\nunbreakable yarn that is stretchable and shrinkable, so that it can be\nsmoothly transformed into other knots without cutting or gluing. Since\nour interest in a knot is the nature of its knottedness regardless of\nshape, size or axis-relative position, the real focus of interest is\nnot just the knot but all its possible transforms. A way to think of\nthis is to imagine a knot transforming continuously, so that every\npossible transform is realized at some time. Then the thing of central\ninterest would be the object that persists over time in varying forms,\nwith knots strictly so called being the things captured in each\nparticular freeze frame. Mathematically, we represent the relevant\nentity as an equivalence class of knots. Two knots are equivalent iff one can be smoothly deformed into the other by stretching, shrinking, twisting, flipping, repositioning or in any other way that does not involve cutting, gluing or passing one strand through another. The relevant kind of deformation forbids eliminating a knotted part\nby shrinking it down to a point. Again there are mathematically\nprecise definitions of knot-equivalence. Figure 3 gives diagrams of\nequivalent knots, instances of a trefoil. Figure 3 Diagrams like these are not merely illustrations; they also have an\noperational role in knot theory. But not any picture of a knot will do\nfor this purpose. We need to specify:  A knot diagram is a regular projection of a knot onto a plane which, when there is a crossing, tells us which strand passes over the other. Regularity here is a combination of conditions. In particular,\nregularity entails that not more than two points of the strict knot\nproject to the same point on the plane, and that two points of the\nstrict knot project to the same point on the plane only where there is\na crossing. For more on diagrams in knot theory see (De Toffoli and\nGiardino 2014). A major task of knot theory is to find ways of telling whether two\nknot diagrams are diagrams of equivalent knots. In particular we will\nwant to know if a given knot diagram represents a knot equivalent to\nan unknot, that is, a knot representable by a knot diagram\nwithout crossings. One way of showing that a knot diagram represents a knot equivalent\nto an unknot is to show that the diagram can be transformed into one\nwithout crossings by a sequence of atomic moves, known as Reidemeister\nmoves. The relevant background fact is Reidemeister’s theorem,\nwhich links the visualizable diagrammatic changes to the\nmathematically precise definition of knot equivalence: Two knots are\nequivalent if and only if there is a finite sequence of Reidemeister\nmoves taking a knot diagram of one to a knot diagram of the\nother. Figure 4 illustrates.  Each knot diagram is changed into the\nadjacent knot diagram by a Reidemeister move; hence the knot\nrepresented by the leftmost diagram is equivalent to the unknot. Figure 4 In contrast to these, the knot presented by the left knot diagram\nof Figure 3, a trefoil, may seem impossible to\ndeform into an unknot. And in fact it is. To prove it, we can use a\nknot invariant known as colourability. An arc in a knot diagram is a\nmaximal part between crossings (or the whole thing if there are no\ncrossings). Colourability is this:  A knot diagram is colourable if and only if each of its arcs can be coloured one of three different colours so that (a) at least two colours are used and (b) at each crossing the three arcs are all coloured the same or all coloured differently. The reference to colours here is inessential. Colourability is in\nfact a specific case of a kind of combinatorial property known as mod\n\\(p\\) labelling (for \\(p\\) an odd prime). Colourability is a knot\ninvariant in the sense that if one diagram of a knot is colourable\nevery diagram of that knot and of any equivalent knot is\ncolourable. (By Reidemeister’s theorem this can be proved by\nshowing that each Reidemeister move preserves colourability.) A\nstandard diagram of an unknot, a diagram without crossings, is clearly\nnot colourable because it has only one arc (the whole thing) and so\ntwo colours cannot be used. So in order to complete proving that the\ntrefoil is not equivalent to an unknot, we only need prove that our\ntrefoil diagram is colourable. This can be done visually. Colour each\narc of the knot diagram one of the three colours red, green or blue so\nthat no two arcs have the same colour (or visualize this). Then do a\nvisual check of each crossing, to see that at each crossing the three\nmeeting arcs are all coloured differently. That visual part of the\nproof is clearly non-superfluous and non-replaceable (without changing\nthe proof). Moreover, the soundness of the argument is quite\ntransparent.  So here is a case of a non-formal, non-symbolic visual\nway of proving a mathematical truth. Where notions involving the infinite are in play, such as many\ninvolving limits, the use of diagrams is famously risky. For this\nreason it has been widely thought that, beyond some very simple cases,\narguments in real and complex analysis in which diagrams have a\nnon-superfluous role are not genuine proofs. Bolzano [1817] expressed\nthis attitude with regard to the intermediate value theorem for the\nreal numbers (IVT) before giving a purely analytic proof, arguing that\nspatial thinking could not be used to help justify the IVT. James\nRobert Brown (1999) takes issue with Bolzano on this point.  The IVT\nis this: If \\(f\\) is a real-valued function of a real variable continuous on the closed interval \\([a, b]\\) and \\(f(a) < c < f(b)\\), then for some \\(x\\) in \\((a, b), f(x) = c\\). Brown focuses on the special case when \\(c = 0\\). As the IVT can be\ndeduced easily from this special case using the theorem that the\ndifference of two continuous functions is continuous, there is no loss\nof generality here. Alluding to a diagram like Figure 5, Brown (1999)\nwrites\n  We have a continuous line running from below to above\nthe \\(x\\)-axis. Clearly, it must cross that axis in doing\nso. (1999: 26)   Later he claims:   Using the picture alone, we can be certain of this result—if\nwe can be certain of anything. (1999: 28)  Figure 5 Bolzano’s diagram-free proof of the IVT is an argument from\nwhat later became known as the Dedekind completeness of the real\nnumbers: every non-empty set of reals bounded above (below) has a\nleast upper bound (greatest lower bound). The value of Bolzano’s\ndeduction of the IVT from the Dedekind completeness of the reals,\naccording to Brown, is not that it proves the IVT but that it gives us\nconfirmation of Dedekind completeness, just as an empirical hypothesis\nin empirical science gets confirmed by deducing some consequence of\nthe hypothesis and observing those consequence to be true. This view\nassumes that we already know the IVT to be true by observing a diagram\nrelevantly like Figure 5. That assumption is challenged by Giaquinto (2011). Once we\ndistinguish graphical concepts from associated analytic concepts, the\nunderlying argument from the diagram is essentially this. What is inferred from the diagram is premiss 2. Premisses 1 and 3\nare assumptions linking analytical with graphical conditions. These\nlinking assumptions are disputed. With regard to premiss 1 Giaquinto\n(2011) argues that there are functions on the reals which meet the\nantecedent condition but do not have graphical curves, such as\ncontinuous but nowhere differentiable functions and functions which\noscillate with unbounded frequency e.g., \\(f(x) = x \\cdot\\sin(1/x)\\)\nfor non-zero \\(x\\) in \\([-1, 1]\\) and \\(f(0) = 0\\). With regard to premiss 3 it is argued that, under the standard\nconventions of graphical representation of functions in a Cartesian\nco-ordinate frame, the graphical curve for \\(x^2 - 2\\) in the\nrationals is the same as the graphical curve for \\(x^2- 2\\) in the\nreals. This is because every real is a limit point of rationals; so\nfor every point \\(P\\) with one or both co-ordinates irrational, there\nare points arbitrarily close to \\(P\\) with both co-ordinates rational;\nso no gaps would appear if irrational points were removed from the\ncurve for \\(x^2- 2\\) in the reals. But for \\(x\\) in the rational\ninterval [0, 2] the function \\(x^2- 2\\) has no zero value, even though\nit has a graphical curve which visually crosses the line representing\nthe \\(x\\)-axis. So one cannot read off the existence of a zero of\n\\(x^2- 2\\) on the reals from the diagram; one needs to appeal to some\nproperty of the reals which the rationals lack, such as Dedekind\ncompleteness. This raises some obvious questions. Do any theorems of\nanalysis have proofs in which diagrams have a non-superfluous role?\nLittlewood (1953: 54–5) thought so and gives an example which is\nexamined in Giaquinto (1994). If so, can we demarcate this class of\ntheorems by some mathematical feature of their content? Another\nquestion is whether there is a significantly broad class of functions\non the reals for which we could prove an intermediate value theorem\n(i.e., restricted to that class). If there are theorems of analysis provable with diagrams we do not\nyet have a mathematical demarcation criterion for them. A natural\nplace to look would be O-minimal structures on the reals—this\nwas brought to the author’s attention by Ethan Galebach. This is\nbecause of some remarkable theorems about such structures which\nexclude all the pathological (hence vision-defying) functions on the\nreals (Van den Dries 1998), such as continuous nowhere differentiable\nfunctions and “space-filling” curves i.e., continuous\nsurjections \\(f:(0, 1)\\rightarrow(0, 1)^2\\). Is the IVT for functions\nin an O-minimal structure on the reals provable by visual means?\nCertainly one objection to the visual argument for the unrestricted\nIVT does not apply when the restriction is in place. This is the\nobjection that continuous nowhere differentiable functions, having no\ngraphical curve, provide counterexamples to the premiss that any\n\\(\\varepsilon\\textrm{-}\\delta\\) continuous function \\(f\\) on \\([a,\nb]\\) with \\(f (a) < c < f (b)\\) has a visually continuous\ngraphical curve from below the horizontal line representing \\(y = c\\)\nto above.  But the existence of continuous functions with no graphical\ncurve is not the only objection to the visual argument, contrary to a\nclaim of Azzouni (2013: 327). There are also counterexamples to the\npremiss that any function that does have a graphical curve\nwhich visibly crosses the line representing \\(y = c\\) takes \\(c\\) as a\nvalue, e.g., the function \\(x^2 - 2\\) on the rationals with \\(c =\n0\\). So the question of a visual proof of the IVT restricted to\nfunctions in an O-minimal structure on the reals is still open at the\ntime of writing. Though philosophical discussion of visual thinking in mathematics\nhas concentrated on its role in proof, visual thinking may be more\nvaluable for discovery than proof. Three kinds of discovery important\nin mathematical practice are these: In the following subsections visual discovery of these kinds will\nbe discussed and illustrated. To discover a truth, as that expression is being used\nhere, is to come to believe it by one’s own lights (as opposed\nto reading it or being told) in a way that is reliable and involves no\nviolation of epistemic rationality (given one’s epistemic\nstate).  One can discover a truth without being the first to discover\nit (in this context); it is enough that one comes to believe it in an\nindependent, reliable and rational way. The difference between merely\ndiscovering a truth and proving it is a matter of transparency: for\nproving or following a proof the subject must be aware of the way in\nwhich the conclusion is reached and the soundness of that way; this is\nnot required for discovery. Sometimes one discovers something by means of visual thinking using\nbackground knowledge, resulting in a cogent argument from which one\ncould construct a proof. A nice example is a visual argument that any\nknot diagram with a finite number of crossings can be turned into a\ndiagram of an unknot by interchanging the over-strand and under-strand\nof some of its crossings (Adams 2001: 58–90). That argument is a\nbit too long to present accessibly here. For a short example, here is\na way of discovering that the geometric mean of two positive numbers\nis less than or equal to their arithmetic mean (Eddy 1985) using\nFigure 6. Figure 6 Two circles (with diameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) meet at a single\npoint. A line is drawn between their centres through their common\npoint; its length is \\((a + b)/2\\), the sum of the two radii. This\nline is the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle with one other side\nof length \\((a - b)/2\\), the difference of the radii.\nPythagoras’s theorem is used to infer that the remaining side of\nthe right-angled triangle has length \\(\\sqrt{(ab)}\\).Then visualizing\nwhat happens to the triangle when the diameter of the smaller circle\nvaries between 0 and the diameter of the larger circle, one infers\nthat \\(0 < \\sqrt{(ab)} < (a + b)/2\\); then verifying\nsymbolically that \\(\\sqrt{(ab)} = (a + b)/2\\) when \\(a = b\\), one\nconcludes that for positive \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(\\sqrt{(ab)} \\le (a +\nb)/2\\). This thinking does not constitute a case of proving or following a\nproof of the conclusion, because it involves a step which we cannot\nclearly tell is valid. This is the step of attempting to\nvisually imagine what would happen when the smaller circle varies in\ndiameter between 0 and the diameter of the larger circle and inferring\nfrom the resulting experience that the line joining the centres of the\ncircles will always be longer than the horizontal line from the centre\nof the smaller circle to the vertical diameter of the larger circle.\nThis step seems sound (does not lead us into error) and may\nbe sound; but its soundness is opaque. If in fact it is\nsound, the whole thinking process is a reliable way of reaching the\nconclusion; so in the absence of factors that would make it irrational\nto trust the thinking, it would be a way of discovering the conclusion\nto be true. In some cases visual thinking inclines one to believe something on\nthe basis of assumptions suggested by the visual representation that\nremain to be justified given the subject’s current knowledge. In\nsuch cases there is always the danger that the subject takes the\nvisual representation to show the correctness of the assumptions and\nends up with an unwarranted belief. In such a case, even if the belief\nis true, the subject has not made a discovery, as the means of\nbelief-acquisition is unreliable. Here is an example using Figure 7\n(Montuchi and Page 1988). Figure 7 Using this diagram one can come to think the following about the\nreal numbers. When for a constant \\(k\\) the positive values of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are constrained to satisfy the equation \\(x \\cdot y = k\\),\nthe positive values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) for which \\(x + y\\) is minimal\nare \\(x = \\sqrt{k} = y\\). (Let “#” denote this claim.) Suppose that one knows the conventions for representing functions\nby graphs in a Cartesian co-ordinate system, knows also that the\ndiagonal represents the function \\(y = x\\), and that a line segment\nwith gradient –1 from \\((0, b)\\) to \\((b, 0)\\) represents the\nfunction \\(x + y = b\\). Then looking at the diagram may incline one to\nthink that for no positive value of \\(x\\) does the value of \\(y\\) in\nthe function \\(x\\cdot y = k\\) fall below the value of \\(y\\) in \\(x + y\n= 2\\sqrt{k}\\), and that these functions coincide just at the\ndiagonal. From these beliefs the subject may (correctly) infer the\nconclusion #. But mere attention to the diagram cannot warrant\nbelieving that, for a given positive \\(x\\)-value, the \\(y\\)-value of\n\\(x\\cdot y = k\\) never falls below the \\(y\\)-value of \\(x + y =\n2\\sqrt{k}\\) and that the functions coincide just at the diagonal; for\nthe conventions of representation do not rule out that the curve of\n\\(x\\cdot y = k\\) meets the curve of \\(x + y = 2\\sqrt{k}\\) at two\npoints extremely close to the diagonal, and that the former curve\nfalls under the latter in between those two points. So the visual\nthinking is not in this case a means of discovering proposition #. But it is useful because it provides the idea for a proof of the\nconclusion—one of the major benefits of visual thinking in\nmathematics. In brief: for each equation \\((x\\cdot y = k\\); \\(x + y =\n2\\sqrt{k})\\) if \\(x = y\\), their common value is \\(\\sqrt{k}\\). So the\nfunctions expressed by those equations meet at the diagonal. To show\nthat, for a fixed positive \\(x\\)-value, the \\(y\\)-values of \\(x\\cdot y\n= k\\) never fall below the \\(y\\)-values of \\(x + y = 2\\sqrt{k}\\), it\nsuffices to show that \\(2\\sqrt{k} - x \\le k/x\\). As a geometric mean\nis less than or equal to the corresponding arithmetic mean, \\(\\sqrt{[x\n\\cdot (k/x)]} \\le [x + (k/x)]/2\\).  So \\(2\\sqrt{k} \\le x + (k/x)\\).\nSo \\(2\\sqrt{k} - x \\le k/x\\). In this example, visual attention to, and reasoning about, the\ndiagram is not part of a way of discovering the conclusion. But if it\ngave one the idea for the argument just given, it would be part of\nwhat led to a way of discovering the conclusion, and that is\nimportant. Can visual thinking lead to discovery of an idea for a proof in\nmore advanced contexts? Yes. Carter (2010) gives an example from free\nprobability theory. The case is about certain permutations (those\ndenoted by “\\(p\\)” with a circumflex in Carter 2010) on a\nfinite set of natural numbers. Using specific kinds of diagram, easily\nseen properties of the diagrams lead one naturally to certain\nproperties of the permutations (crossing and non-crossing, having\nneighbouring pairs), and to a certain operation (cancellation of\nneighbouring pairs). All of these have algebraic definitions, but the\nideas defined were noticed by thinking in terms of the diagrams. For\nthe relevant permutations \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\sigma(\\sigma(n)) = n\\); so a\npermutation can be represented by a set of lines joining dots. The\npermutations represented on the left and right in Figure 8 are\nnon-crossing and crossing respectively, the former with neighbouring\npairs \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) and \\(\\{6, 7\\}\\). Figure 8 A permutation \\(\\sigma\\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2p\\}\\) is defined to\nhave a crossing just when there are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), \\(d\\) in\n\\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2p\\}\\) such that \\(a < b < c < d\\) and\n\\(\\sigma(a) = c\\) and \\(\\sigma(b) = d\\). The focus is on the proof of\na theorem which employs this notion. (The theorem is that when a\npermutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 2p\\}\\) of the relevant kind is\nnon-crossing, there will be exactly \\(p+1\\) R-equivalence classes,\nwhere \\(R\\) is a certain equivalence relation on \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots,\n2p\\}\\) defined in terms of the permutation.) Carter says that the\nproofs of some lemmas “rely on a visualization of the\nsetup”, in that to grasp the correctness of one or more of the\nsteps one needs to visualize the situation. There is also a nice\nexample of some reasoning in terms of a diagram which gives the idea\nfor a proof (“suggests a proof strategy”) for the lemma\nthat every non-crossing permutation has a neighbouring\npair. Reflection on a diagram such as Figure 9 does the work. Figure 9 The reasoning is this. Suppose that \\(\\pi\\) has no neighbouring\npair.  Choose \\(j\\) such that \\(\\pi(j) - j = a\\) is minimal, that is,\nfor all \\(k, \\pi(j) - j \\le \\pi(k) - k\\). As \\(\\pi\\) has no\nneighbouring pair, \\(\\pi(j+1) \\ne j\\). So either \\(\\pi(j+1)\\) is less\nthan \\(j\\) and we have a crossing, or by minimality of \\(\\pi(j) - j\\),\n\\(\\pi(j+1)\\) is greater than \\(j+a\\) and again we have a\ncrossing. Carter reports that this disjunction was initially believed\nby thinking in term of the diagram, and the proof of the lemma given\nin the published paper is a non-diagrammatic “version” of\nthat reasoning. In this case study, visual thinking is shown to\ncontribute to discovery in several ways; in particular, by leading the\nmathematicians to notice crucial properties—the\n“definitions are based on the diagrams”—and in\ngiving them the ideas for parts of the overall proof. In this section I will illustrate and then discuss the use of\nvisual thinking in discovering kinds of mathematical entity, by going\nthrough a few of the main steps leading to geometric group theory, a\nsubject which really took off in the 1980s through the work of Mikhail\nGromov.  The material is set out nicely in greater depth in Starikova\n(2012). Sometimes it can be fruitful to think of non-spatial entities, such\nas algebraic structures, in terms of a spatial representation. An\nexample is the representation of a finitely generated group by a\nCayley graph. Let \\((G, \\cdot)\\) be a group and \\(S\\) a finite subset\nof \\(G\\). Let \\(S^{-1}\\) be the set of inverses of members of \\(S\\).\nThen \\((G, \\cdot)\\) is generated by \\(S\\) if and only if\nevery member of \\(G\\) is the product (with respect to \\(\\cdot\\)) of\nmembers of \\(S\\cup S^{-1}\\). In that case \\((G, \\cdot, S)\\) is said to\nbe a finitely generated group. Here are a couple of examples. First consider the group \\(S_{3}\\) of permutations of 3 elements\nunder composition. Letting \\(\\{a, b, c\\}\\) be the elements, all six\npermutations can be generated by \\(\\rf\\) and \\(\\rr\\) where \\(\\rf\\) (for “flip”) fixes a and swaps \\(b\\) with \\(c\\),\ni.e., it takes to \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\) to \\(\\langle a, c,\nb\\rangle\\), and \\(\\rr\\) (for “rotate”) takes \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\) to\n\\(\\langle c, a, b\\rangle\\). The Cayley graph for \\((S_{3}, \\cdot, \\{\\rf, \\rr\\})\\) is a graph\nwhose vertices represent the members of \\(S_{3}\\) and two\n“colours” of directed edges, representing composition with\n\\(\\rf\\) and composition with \\(\\rr\\). Figure 10 illustrates: red\ndirected edges represent composition with \\(\\rr\\) and black edges\nrepresent composition with \\(\\rf\\). So a red edge from a vertex\n\\(\\rv\\) representing \\(\\rs\\) in \\(S_{3}\\) ends at a vertex\nrepresenting \\(\\rs\\rr\\) and a black edge from \\(\\rv\\) ends at a vertex\nrepresenting \\(\\rs\\rf\\).  (Notation: “\\(\\rs\\rr\\)”\nabbreviates “\\(\\rs \\cdot \\rr\\)” which here denotes\n“\\(\\rs\\) followed by \\(\\rr\\)”; same for\n“\\(\\rf\\)” in place of “\\(\\rr\\)”.) A black edge\nhas arrowheads both ways because \\(\\rf\\) is its own inverse, that is,\nflipping and flipping again takes you back to where you\nstarted. (Sometimes a pair of edges with arrows in opposite directions\nis used instead.) The symbol “\\(\\re\\)” denotes the identity. Figure 10 An example of a finitely generated group of infinite order is\n\\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{1\\})\\). We can get any integer by successively\nadding 1 or its additive inverse \\(-1\\). Since 3 added to the inverse\nof 2 is 1, and 2 added to the inverse of 3 is \\(-1\\), we can get any\ninteger by adding members of \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) and their inverses. Thus\nboth \\(\\{1\\}\\) and \\(\\{2, 3\\}\\) are generating sets for \\((\\mathbb{Z},\n+)\\). Figure 11 illustrates part of the Cayley graph for\n\\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{2, 3\\})\\). The horizontal directed edges represent\n+2. The directed edges ascending or descending obliquely represent\n\\(+3\\).\n  Figure 11 Another example of a generated group of infinite order is \\(F_2\\),\nthe free group generated by a pair of members. The first few\niterations of its Cayley graph are shown in Figure 12, where \\(\\{a,\nb\\}\\) is the set of generators and a right horizontal move between\nadjacent vertices represents composition with \\(a\\), an upward\nvertical move represents composition with \\(b\\), and leftward and\ndownward moves represent composition with the inverse of \\(a\\) and the\ninverse of \\(b\\) respectively.  The central vertex represents the\nidentity. Figure 12 Thinking of generated groups in terms of their Cayley graphs makes\nit very natural to view them as metric spaces. A path is a\nsequence of consecutively adjacent edges, regardless of direction. For\nexample in the Cayley graph for \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{2, 3\\})\\) the\nedges from \\(-2\\) to 1, from 1 to \\(-1\\), from \\(-1\\) to 2 (in that\norder) constitute a path, representing the action, starting from\n\\(-2\\), of adding 3, then adding \\(-2\\), then adding 3. Taking each\nedge to have unit length, the metric \\(d_S\\) for a group \\(G\\)\ngenerated by a finite subset \\(S\\) of \\(G\\) is defined: for any \\(g\\),\n\\(h \\in G\\), \\(d_{S}(g, h) =\\) the length of a shortest path from\n\\(g\\) to \\(h\\) in the Caley graph of \\((G, \\cdot, S)\\). This is the\nword metric for this generated group. Viewing a finitely generated group as a metric space allows us to\nconsider its growth function \\(\\gamma(n)\\) which is the cardinality of\nthe “ball” of radius \\(\\le n\\) centred on the identity\n(the number of members of the group whose distance from the identity\nis not greater than \\(n\\)). A growth function for a given group\ndepends on the set of generators chosen, but when the group is\ninfinite the asymptotic behaviour as \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\) of the\ngrowth functions is independent of the set of generators. Noticing the possibility of defining a metric on generated groups\ndid not require first viewing diagrams of their Cayley graphs. This is\nbecause a word in the generators is just a finite sequence of symbols\nfor the generators or their inverses (we omit the symbol for the group\noperation), and so has an obvious length visually suggested by the\nwritten form of the word, namely the number of symbols in the\nsequence; and then it is natural to define the distance between group\nmembers \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) to be the length of a shortest word that gets\none from \\(g\\) to \\(h\\) by right multiplication, that is,\n\\(\\textrm{min}\\{\\textrm{length}(w): w = g^{-1}h\\}\\).  However, viewing generated groups by means of their Cayley graphs\nwas the necessary starting point for geometric group theory, which\nenables us to view finitely generated groups of infinite order not\nmerely as graphs or metric spaces but as geometric entities. The main\nsteps on this route will be sketched briefly here; for more detail see\nStarikova (2012) and the references therein. The visual key is to\nstart thinking in terms of the “coarse geometry” of the\nCayley graph of the generated group, by zooming out in visual\nimagination so far that the discrete nature of the graph is\ntransformed into a traditional geometrical object. For example, the\nCayley graph of a generated group of finite order such as \\((S_{3},\n\\cdot, \\{f, r\\})\\) illustrated in Figure 11\nbecomes a dot; the Cayley graph for \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\{2, 3\\})\\)\nillustrated in Figure 12 becomes an uninterrupted\nline infinite in both directions.  The word metric of a generated group is discrete: the values are\nalways in \\(N\\). How is this visuo-spatial association of a discrete\nmetric space with a continuous geometrical object achieved\nmathematically? By quasi-isometry. While an isometry from one metric\nspace to another is a distance preserving map, a quasi-isometry is a\nmap which preserves distances to within fixed linear bounds. Precisely\nput, a map \\(f\\) from \\((S, d)\\) to \\((S', d')\\) is a\nquasi-isometry iff for some real constants \\(L > 0\\) and\n\\(K \\ge 0\\) and all \\(x\\), \\(y\\) in \\(S\\) \\[ d(x, y)/L - K \\le\nd'(f(x), f(y)) \\le L \\cdot d(x, y) + K.  \\] The spaces \\((S, d)\\) and \\((S', d')\\) are\nquasi-isometric spaces iff the quasi-isometry \\(f\\)\nis also quasi-surjective, in the sense that there is a real constant\n\\(M \\ge 0\\) such that every point of \\(S'\\) is no further than \\(M\\)\naway from some point in the image of \\(f\\). For example, \\((\\mathbb{Z}, d)\\) is quasi-isometric to\n\\((\\mathbb{R}, d)\\) where \\(d(x, y) = |y - x|\\), because the inclusion\nmap \\(\\iota\\) from \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\iota(n) = n\\),\nis an isometry hence a quasi-isometry with \\(L = 1\\) and \\(K = 0\\),\nand each point in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is no further than \\(1/2\\) away from\nan integer (in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)). Also, it is easy to see that for any\nreal number \\(x\\), if \\(g(x) =\\) the nearest integer to \\(x\\) (or the\ngreatest integer less than \\(x\\) if it is midway between integers)\nthen \\(g\\) is a quasi-isometry from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\nwith \\(L = 1\\) and \\(K =\\frac{1}{2}\\);. The relation between metric spaces of being quasi-isometric is an\nequivalence relation. Also, if \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are generating sets of\na group \\((G, \\cdot)\\), the Cayley graphs of \\((G, \\cdot, S)\\) and\n\\((G, \\cdot, T)\\) with their word metrics are quasi-isometric\nspaces. This means that properties of a generated group which are\nquasi-isometric invariants will be independent of the choice of\ngenerating set, and therefore informative about the group itself. Moreover, it is easy to show that the Cayley graph of a generated\ngroup with word metric is quasi-isometric to a geodesic \nspace.[1] \n A triangle\nwith vertices \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\) in this space is the union of three\ngeodesic segments, between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\),\nand between \\(z\\) and \\(x\\). This is the gateway for the application\nof Gromov’s insights, some of which can be grasped with the help\nof visual geometric thinking. Here are some indications. Recall the Poincaré open disc\nmodel of hyperbolic geometry: geodesics are diameters or arcs of\ncircles orthogonal to the boundary, with unit distance represented by\never shorter Euclidean distances as one moves from the centre towards\nthe boundary. (The boundary is not part of the model). All triangles\nhave angle sum \\(< \\pi\\) (Figure 13, left), and\nthere is a global constant δ such that all triangles are\nδ-thin in the following sense: A triangle \\(T\\) is δ-thin if and\nonly if any point on one side of \\(T\\) lies within δ of some\npoint on one of the other two sides. This condition is equivalent to the condition that each side of\n\\(T\\) lies within the union of the δ-neighbourhoods of the other\ntwo sides, as illustrated in Figure 13,\nright. There is no constant δ such that all triangles in a\nEuclidean plane are δ-thin, because for any δ there are\ntriangles large enough that the midpoint of a longest side lies\nfurther than δ from all points on the other two sides. Figure 13[2] The definition of thin triangles is sufficiently general to apply\nto any geodesic space and allows a generalisation of the concept of\nhyperbolicity beyond its original context: The class of hyperbolic groups is large and includes important\nsubkinds, such as finite groups, free groups and the fundamental\ngroups of surfaces of genus \\(\\ge 2\\). Some striking theorems have\nbeen proved for them. For example, for every hyperbolic group the word\nproblem is solvable, and every hyperbolic group has a finite\npresentation. So we can reasonably conclude that the discovery of this\nmathematical kind, the hyperbolic groups, has been fruitful. How important was visual thinking to the discoveries leading to\ngeometric group theory? Visual thinking was needed to discover Cayley\ngraphs as a means of representing finitely generated groups. This is\nnot the triviality it might seem: Cayley graphs must be distinguished\nfrom the diagrams we use to present them visually. A Cayley graph is a\nmathematical representation of a generated group, not a\nvisual representation. It consists of the following\ncomponents: a set \\(V\\) (“vertices”), a set \\(E\\) of\nordered pairs of members of \\(V\\) (“directed edges”) and a\npartition of \\(E\\) into distinguished subsets, (“colours”,\neach one for representing right multiplication by a particular\ngenerator). The Cayley graph of a generated group of infinite order\ncannot be fully represented by a diagram given the usual conventions\nof representation for diagrams of graphs, and distinct diagrams may\nvisually represent the same Cayley graph: both diagrams in Figure 14\ncan be labelled so that under the usual conventions they represent the\nCayley graph of \\((S_{3}, \\cdot, \\{f, r\\})\\), already illustrated by\nFigure 10. So the Cayley graph cannot be a\ndiagram. Figure 14 Diagrams of Cayley graphs were important in prompting\nmathematicians to think in terms of the coarse-grained geometry of the\ngraphs, in that this idea arises just when one thinks in terms of\n“zooming out” visually. Gromov (1993) makes the point in a\npassage quoted in Starikova (2012:138)  This space [a Cayley graph with the word metric] may\nappear boring and uneventful to a geometer’s eye since it is\ndiscrete and the traditional (e.g., topological and infinitesimal)\nmachinery does not run in [the group] Γ. To regain the geometric\nperspective one has to change one’s position and move the\nobservation point far away from Γ.  Then the metric in Γ\nseen from the distance \\(d\\) becomes the original distance divided by\n\\(d\\) and for \\(d \\rightarrow \\infty\\) the points in Γ coalesce\ninto a connected continuous solid unity which occupies the visual\nhorizon without any gaps and holes and fills our geometer’s\nheart with joy. In saying that one has to move the observation point far away from\nΓ so that the points coalesce into a unity which occupies the\nvisual horizon, he makes clear that visual imagination is involved in\na crucial step on the road to geometric group theory. Visual thinking\nis again involved in discovering hyperbolicity as a property of\ngeneral geodesic spaces from thinking about the Poincaré disk\nmodel of hyperbolic geometry. It is hard to see how this property\nwould have been discovered without the use of visual resources.  \nWhile there is no reason to think that mental arithmetic (mental\ncalculation in the integers and rational numbers) typically involves\nmuch visual thinking, there is strong evidence of substantial visual\nprocessing in the mental arithmetic of highly trained abacus users. \nIn earlier times an abacus would be a rectangular board or table\nsurface marked with lines or grooves along which pebbles or counters\ncould be moved. The oldest surviving abacus, the Salamis abacus, dated\naround 300 BCE, is a white marble slab, with markings designed for\nmonetary calculation (Fernandes 2015, Other Internet Resources). These were\nsuperseded by rectangular frames within which wires or rods parallel to\nthe short sides are fixed, with moveable holed beads on them. There are\nseveral kinds of modern abacus — the Chinese suanpan, the Russian\nschoty and the Japanese soroban for example — each kind with\nvariations. Evidence for visual processing in mental arithmetic comes\nfrom studies with well trained users of the soroban, an example of\nwhich is shown in Figure 15. Figure 15 \n\nEach column of beads represents a power of 10, increasing to the\nleft. The horizontal bar, sometimes called the reckoning\nbar, separates the beads on each column into one bead of value 5\nabove and four beads of value 1 below. The number represented in a\ncolumn is determined by the beads which are not separated from the\nreckoning bar. A column on which all beads are separated by a gap from\nthe bar represents zero. For example, the number 6059 is represented on\na portion of a schematic soroban in Figure 16. Figure 16 \nOn some sorobans there is a mark on the reckoning bar at every third\ncolumn; if a user chooses one of these as a unit column, the marks will\nhelp the user keep track of which columns represent which powers of\nten. Calculations are made by using forefinger and thumb to move beads\naccording to procedures for the standard four numerical operations and\nfor extraction of square and cube roots (Bernazzani 2005,Other Internet Resources). Despite the\nfact that the soroban has a decimal place representation of numbers,\nthe soroban procedures are not ‘translations’ of the\nprocedures normally taught for the standard operations using arabic\nnumerals. For example, multidigit addition on a soroban starts by\nadding highest powers of ten and proceeds rightwards to lower powers,\ninstead of starting with units thence proceeding leftwards to tens,\nhundreds and so on. \nPeople trained to use a soroban often learn to do mental arithmetic\nby visualizing an abacus and imagining moving beads on it in accordance\nwith the procedures learned for arithmetical calculations (Frank and\nBarner 2012). Mental abacus (MA), as this kind of mental arithmetic is\nknown, compares favourably with other kinds of mental calculation for\nspeed and accuracy (Kojima 1954) and MA users are often found among the\nmedallists in the Mental Calculation World Cup. \nAlthough visual and manual motor imagery is likely to occur,\ncognitive scientists have probed the question whether the actual\nprocesses of MA calculation consist in or involve imagining performing\noperations on a physical abacus. Brain imaging studies provide one\nsource of evidence bearing on this question. Comparing well-trained\nabacus calculators with matched controls, evidence has been found that\nMA involves neural resources of visuospatial working memory with a form\nof abacus which does not depend on the modality (visual or auditory) of\nthe numerical inputs (Chen et al. 2006). Another imaging study found\nthat, compared to controls without abacus training, subjects with long\nterm MA training from a young age had enhanced brain white matter\nrelated to motor and visuospatial processes (Hu et al. 2011). \nBehavioural studies provide more evidence. Tests on expert and\nintermediate level abacus users strongly suggest that MA calculators\nmentally manipulate an abacus representation so that it passes through\nthe same states that an actual abacus would pass through in solving an\naddition problem. Without using an actual abacus MA calculators were\nable to answer correctly questions about intermediates states unique to\nthe abacus-based solution of a problem; moreover, their response times\nwere a monotonic function of the position of the probed state in the\nsequence of states of the abacus process for solving the problem\n(Stigler 1984). On top of the ‘intermediate states’\nevidence, there is ‘error type’ evidence. Mental addition\ntests comparing abacus users with American subjects revealed that\nabacus users made errors of a kind which the Americans did not make,\nbut which were predictable from the distribution of errors in physical\nabacus addition (Stigler 1984). \nAnother study found evidence that when a sequence of numbers\nis presented auditorily (as a verbal whole “three thousand five\nhundred and forty seven” or as a digit sequence “Three,\nfive, four, seven”) abacus experts encode it into an imaged\nabacus display, while non-experts encode it verbally (Hishitani\n1990). \nFurther evidence comes from behavioural interference studies. In\nthese studies subjects have to perform mental calculations, with and\nwithout a task of some other kind to be performed during the\ncalculation, with the aim of seeing which kinds of task interfere with\ncalculation as measured by differences of reaction time and error rate.\nAn early study found that a linguistic task interfered weakly with MA\nperformance (unless the linguistic task was to answer a mathematical\nquestion), while motor and visual tasks interfered relatively\nstrongly. These findings suggested to the paper’s authors\nthat MA representations are not linguistic in nature but rely on visual\nmechanisms and, for intermediate practitioners, on motor mechanisms as\nwell (Hatano et al. 1977). \nThese studies provide impressive evidence that MA does involve mental\nmanipulation of a visualized abacus. However, limits of the known\ncapacities for perceiving or representing pluralities of objects seem\nto pose a problem. We have a parallel individuation system\nfor keeping track of up to four objects simultaneously and\nan approximate number system (ANS) which allows us to gauge\nroughly the cardinality of a set of things, with an error which\nincreases with the size of the set. The parallel individuation system\nhas a limit of three or four objects and the ANS represents\ncardinalities greater than four only approximately. Yet mental abacus\nusers would need to hold in mind with precision abacus representations\ninvolving a much larger number of beads than four (and the way in\nwhich those beads are distributed on the abacus). For example, the\nnumber 439 requires a precise distribution of twelve beads. Frank and\nBarner (2012) address this problem. In some circumstances we can\nperceive a plurality of objects as a single entity, a set, and\nsimultaneously perceive those objects as individuals. There is\nevidence that we can keep track of up to three such sets in parallel\nand simultaneously make reliable estimates of the cardinalities of the\nsets (if not more than four). If the sets themselves can be easily\nperceived as (a) divided into disjoint subsets, e.g. columns of beads\non an abacus, and (b) structured in a familiar way, e.g. as a\ndistribution of four beads below a reckoning bar and one above, we\nhave the resources for recognising a three-digit number from its\nabacus representation. The findings of (Frank and Barner 2012) suggest\nthat this is what happens in MA: a mental abacus is represented in\nvisuospatial working memory by splitting it into a series of columns\neach of which is stored as a unit with its own detailed\nsubstructure. \nThese cognitive investigations confirm the self-reports of mental\nabacus users that they calculate mentally by visualizing operating on\nan abacus as they would operate on a physical abacus. (See the 20-second\nmovie\nBrief interview with mental abacus user, at the Stanford Language and Cognition \nLab, for one such self-report.) There is good evidence that MA often involves\nprocesses linked to motor cognition in addition to active visual\nimagination. Intermediate abacus users often make hand movements,\nwithout necessarily attending to those movements during MA calculation,\nas shown in the second of the three short movies just mentioned.\nExperiments to test the possible role of motor processes in MA resulted\nin findings which led the authors to conclude that premotor processes\ninvolved in the planning of hand movements were involved in MA (Brooks\net al. 2018). In coming to know a mathematical truth visual experience can play a\nmerely “enabling” role. For example, visual experience may\nhave been a factor in a person’s getting certain concepts\ninvolved in a mathematical proposition, thus enabling her to\nunderstand the proposition, without giving her reason to believe\nit. Or the visual experience of reading an argument in a text book may\nenable one to find out just what the argument is, without helping her\ntell that the argument is sound. In earlier sections visual experience\nhas been presented as having roles in proof and propositional\ndiscovery that are not merely enabling. On the face of it this raises\na puzzle: mathematics, as opposed to its application to natural\nphenomena, has traditionally been thought to be an a priori\nscience; but if visual experience plays a role in acquiring\nmathematical knowledge which is not merely enabling, the result would\nsurely be a posteriori knowledge, not a priori\nknowledge. Setting aside knowledge acquired by testimony (reading or\nhearing that such-&-such is the case), there remain plenty of\ncases where sensory experience seems to play an evidential role in\ncoming to know some mathematical fact. A plausible example of the evidential use of sensory experience is\nthe case of a child coming to know that \\(5 + 3 = 8\\) by counting on\nher fingers. While there may be an important \\(a\\) priori\nelement in the child’s appreciation that she can reliably\ngeneralise from the result of her counting experiment, getting that\nresult by counting is an a posteriori route to it. For\nanother example, consider the question: how many vertices does a cube\nhave? With the background knowledge that cubes do not vary in shape\nand that material cubes do not differ from geometrical cubes in number\nof vertices (where a “vertex” of a material cube is a\ncorner), one can find the answer by visually inspecting a material\ncube. Or if one does not have a material cube to hand, one can\nvisually imagine a cube, and by attending to its top and bottom faces\nextract the information that the vertices of the cube are exactly the\nvertices of these two quadrangular faces. When one gets the answer by\ninspecting a material cube, the visual experience contributes to\none’s grounds for believing the answer and that contribution is\npart of what makes the belief state knowledge. So the role of the\nvisual experience is evidential; hence the resulting knowledge is not\na priori. When one gets the answer by visually imagining a\ncube, one is drawing on the accumulated cognitive effects of past\nexperiences of seeing material cubes to bring to mind what a cube\nlooks like; so the experience of visual imagining has an indirectly\nevidential role in this case. Do such examples show that mathematics is not an a priori\nscience? Yes, if an a priori science is understood to be one\nwhose knowable truths are all knowable only in an a\npriori way, without use of sense experience as evidence. No, if\nan a priori science is one whose knowable truths are all\nknowable in an a priori way, allowing that some may be\nknowable also in an a posteriori way. Many cases of proving something (or following a proof of it)\ninvolve making, or imagining making, changes in a symbol array. A\nstandard presentation of the proof of left-cancellation in group\ntheory provides an example. “Left-cancellation” is the\nclaim that for any members \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) of a group with\noperation \\(\\cdot\\) and identity element \\(\\mathbf{e}\\), if \\(a \\cdot\nb = a \\cdot c\\), then \\(b = c\\). Here is (the core of) a proof of\nit: Suppose that one comes to know left-cancellation by following this\nsequence of steps. Is this an a priori way of getting this\nknowledge? Although following a mathematical proof is thought to be a\nparadigmatically a priori way of getting knowledge, attention\nto the role of visual experience here throws this into doubt. The case\nfor claiming that the visual experience has an evidential role is as\nfollows. The visual experience reveals not only what the steps of the\nargument are but also that they are valid, thereby contributing to our\ngrounds for accepting the argument and believing its conclusion.\nConsider, for example, the step from the second equation to the third.\nThe relevant background knowledge, apart from the logic of identity,\nis that a group operation is associative. This fact is usually\nrepresented in the form of an equation that simply relocates brackets\nin an obvious way: We see that relocating the brackets in accord with this format, the\nleft-hand term of the second equation is transformed into the\nleft-hand term of the third equation, and the same for the right-hand\nterms. So the visual experience plays an evidential role in our\nrecognising as valid the step from the second equation to the\nthird. Hence this quite standard route to knowledge of\nleft-cancellation turns out to be a posteriori, even though\nit is a clear case of following a proof. Against this, one may argue that the description just given of what\nis going on in following the proof is not strictly correct, as\nfollows.  Exactly the same proof can be expressed in natural language,\nusing “the composition of \\(x\\) with \\(y\\)” for “\\(x\n\\cdot y\\)”, but the result would be hard to take in. Or the\nproof can be presented using a different notational convention, one\nwhich forces a quite different expression of associativity. For\nexample, we can use the Polish convention of putting the operation\nsymbol before the operands: instead of “\\(x \\cdot y\\)” we\nput “\\(\\cdot x y\\)”.  In that case associativity would be\nexpressed in the following way, without brackets: The equations of the proof would then need to be re-symbolised; but\nwhat is expressed by each equation after re-symbolisation and the\nsteps from one to the next would be exactly as before. So we would be\nfollowing the very same proof, step by step. But we would not be using\nvisual experiences involved to notice the relocation of brackets this\ntime. This suggests that the role of the different visual experiences\ninvolved in following the argument in its different guises is merely\nto give us access to the common reasoning: the role of the experience\nis merely enabling. On this account the visual experience does not\nstrictly and literally enable us to see that any of the steps are\nvalid; rather, recognition of (or sensitivity to) the validity of the\nsteps results from cognitive processing at a more abstract level. Which of these rival views is correct? Does our visual experience\nin following the argument presented with brackets (1) reveal to us the\nvalidity of some of the steps, given the relevant background knowledge\n? Or (2) merely give us access to the argument? The core of the\nargument against view (1) is this: Seeing the relocation of brackets is not essential to following the\nargument. So seeing merely gives access to the argument; it does not reveal\nany step to be valid. The step to this conclusion is faulty. How one follows a proof may,\nand in this case does, depend on how it is presented, and different\nways of following a proof may be different ways of coming to know its\nconclusion. While seeing the relocation of brackets is not essential\nto all ways of following this argument, it is essential to the normal\nway of following the argument when it is symbolically presented with\nbrackets in the way given above. Associativity, expressed without symbols, is this: When the binary\ngroup operation is applied twice in succession on an ordered triple of\noperands \\(\\langle a, b, c\\rangle\\), it makes no difference whether\nthe first application is to the initial two operands or the final two\noperands. While this is the content of associativity, for ease of\nprocessing associativity is almost always expressed as a\nsymbol-manipulation rule. Visual perception is used to tell in\nparticular cases whether the rule thus expressed is correctly\nimplemented, in the context of prior knowledge that the rule is\ncorrect. What is going on here is a familiar division of labour in\nmathematical thinking. We first establish the soundness of a rule of\nsymbol-manipulation (in terms of the governing semantic\nconventions—in this case the matter is trivial); then we check\nvisually that the rule is correctly implemented. Processing at a more\nabstract, semantic level is often harder than processing at a purely\nsyntactic level; it is for this reason that we often resort to\nsymbol-manipulation techniques as proxy for reasoning directly with\nmeanings to solve a problem. (What is six eighths divided by\nthree fifths, without using any symbolic technique?) When we do use\nsymbol-manipulation in proving or following a proof, visual experience\nis required to discern that the moves conform to permitted patterns\nand thus contributes to our grounds for accepting the argument. Then\nthe way of coming to know the conclusion has an a posteriori\nelement. Must a use of visual experience in knowledge acquisition be\nevidential, if the visual experience is not merely enabling?\nHere is an example which supports a negative answer. Imagine a square\nor look at a drawing of one. Each of its four sides has a\nmidpoint. Now visualize the “inner” square whose sides run\nbetween the midpoints of adjacent sides of the original square (Figure\n17, left).  By visualizing this figure, it should be clear that the\noriginal square is composed precisely of the inner square plus four\ncorner triangles, each side of the inner square being the base of a\ncorner triangle. One can now visualize the corner triangles folding\nover, with creases along the sides of the inner square. The starting\nand end states of the imagery transformation can be represented by the\nleft and right diagrams of Figure 17. Figure 17 Visualizing the folding-over within the remembered frame of the\noriginal square results in an image of the original square divided\ninto square quarters, its quadrants, and the sides of the inner square\nseem to be diagonals of the quadrants. Many people conclude that the\ncorner triangles can be arranged to cover the inner square exactly,\nwithout any gap or overlap. Thence they infer that the area of the\noriginal square is twice the size of the inner square. Let us assume\nthat the propositions concerned are about Euclidean figures. Our\nconcern is with the visual route to the following: The experience of visualizing the corner triangles folding over can\nlead one to this belief. But it cannot provide good evidence for it.\nThis is because visual experience (of sight or imagination) has\nlimited acuity and so does not enable us to discriminate between a\nsituation in which the outer triangles fit the inner square\nexactly and a situation in which they fit inexactly but well\nenough for the mismatch to escape visual detection. (This contrasts\nwith the case of discovering the number of vertices of a cube by\nseeing or visualizing one.) Even though visualizing the square, the\ninner square and then visualizing the corner triangles folding over is\nconstrained by the results of earlier perceptual experience of scenes\nwith relevant similarities, we cannot draw from it reliable\ninformation about exact equality of areas, because perception itself\nis not reliable about exact equalities (or exact proportions) of\ncontinuous magnitudes. Though the visual experience could not provide good evidence for\nthe belief, it is possible that we erroneously use the\nexperience evidentially in reaching the belief. But it is also\npossible, when reaching the belief in the way described, that we do\nnot take the experience to provide evidence. A non-evidential\nuse is more likely, if when one arrives at the belief in this way one\nfeels fairly certain of it, while aware that visual perception and\nimagination have limited acuity and so cannot provide evidence for a\nclaim of exact fit. But what could the role of the visualizing experience possibly be,\nif it were neither merely enabling nor evidential? One suggestion is\nthat we already have relevant beliefs and belief-forming dispositions,\nand the visualizing experience could serve to bring to mind the\nbeliefs and to activate the belief-forming dispositions (Giaquinto\n2007). These beliefs and dispositions will have resulted from prior\npossession of cognitive resources, some subject-specific such as\nconcepts of geometrical figures, some subject-general such as symmetry\nperception about perceptually salient vertical and horizontal axes. A\nrelevant prior belief in this case might be that a square is symmetric\nabout a diagonal. A relevant disposition might be the disposition to\nbelieve that the quadrants of a square are congruent squares upon\nseeing or visualizing a square with a horizontal base plus the\nvertical and horizontal line segments joining midpoints of its\nopposite sides.  (These dispositions differ from ordinary perceptual\ndispositions to believe what we see in that they are not cancelled\nwhen we mistrust the accuracy of the visual experience.)  The question whether the resulting belief would be knowledge\ndepends on whether the belief-forming dispositions are reliable\n(truth-conducive) and the pre-existing belief states are states of\nknowledge. As these conditions can be met without any violation of\nepistemic rationality, the visualizing route described incompletely\nhere can be a route to knowledge. In that case we would have an\nexample of a use of visual experience which is integral to a way of\nknowing a truth, which is not merely enabling and yet not\nevidential. A fuller account and discussion is given in chapters 3 and\n4 of Giaquinto (2007). There are other significant uses of visual representations in\nmathematics. This final section briefly presents a couple of them. Although the use of diagrams in arguments in analysis faces special\ndangers (as noted in 3.3), the use of\ndiagrams to illustrate symbolically presented operations can be very\nhelpful. Consider, for example, this pair of operations \\(\\{ f(x) + k,\nf(x + k) \\}\\). Grasping them and the difference between them can be\naided by a visual illustration; similarly for the sets \\(\\{ f(x + k),\nf(x - k) \\}\\), \\(\\{ |f(x)|, f(|x|) \\}\\), \\(\\{ f(x)^{-1}, f^{-1}(x),\nf(x^{-1}) \\}\\). While generalization on the basis of a visual\nillustration is unreliable, we can use them as checks against\ncalculation errors and overgeneralization. The same holds for\nproperties. Consider for example, functions for which \\(f(-x) =\nf(x)\\), known as even functions, and functions for which\n\\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\), the odd functions: it can be helpful to\nhave in mind the images of graphs of \\(y = x^2\\) and \\(y = x^{3}\\) as\ninstances of evenness and oddness, to remind one that even functions\nare symmetrical about the \\(y\\)-axis and odd functions have rotation\nsymmetry by \\(\\pi\\) about the origin. They can serve as a reminder and\ncheck against over-generalisation: any general claim true of all odd\nfunctions, for example, must be true of \\(y = x^{3}\\) in\nparticular. The utility of visual representations in real and complex analysis\nis not confined to such simple cases. Visual representations can help\nus grasp what motivates certain definitions and arguments, and thereby\ndeepen our understanding. Abundant confirmation of this claim can be\ngathered from working through the text Visual Complex\nAnalysis (Needham 1997). Some mathematical subjects have natural\nvisual representations, which then give rise to a domain of\nmathematical entities in their own right. This is true of geometry but\nis also true of subjects which become algebraic in nature very\nquickly, such as graph theory, knot theory and braid\ntheory. Techniques of computer graphics now enable us to use moving\nimages. For an example of the power of kinematic visual\nrepresentations to provide and increase understanding of a subject,\nsee the first two “chapters” of the online introduction to\nbraid theory by Ester Dalvit (2012, Other Internet Resources).  With regard to proofs, a minimal kind of understanding consists in\nunderstanding each line (proposition or formula) and grasping the\nvalidity of each step to a new line from earlier lines. But we can\nhave that stepwise grasp of proof without any idea of why it proceeds\nby those steps. One has a more advanced (or deeper) kind of\nunderstanding when one has the minimal understanding and a\ngrasp of the motivating idea(s) and strategy of the proof. The point\nis sharply expressed by Weyl (1995 [1932]: 453), quoted in (Tappenden\n2005:150)  We are not very pleased when we are forced to accept\na mathematical truth by virtue of a complicated chain of formal\nconclusions and computations, which we traverse blindly, link by link,\nfeeling our way by touch. We want first an overview of the aim and the\nroad; we want to understand the idea of the proof, the deeper\ncontext. Occasionally the author of a proof gives readers the desired\nunderstanding by adding commentary. But this is not always needed, as\nthe idea of a proof is sometimes revealed in the presentation of the\nproof itself. Often this is done by using visual representations. An\nexample is Fisk’s proof of Chvátal’s “art\ngallery” theorem. This theorem is the answer to a combinatorial\nproblem in geometry. Put concretely, the problem is this. Let the\n\\(n\\) walls of a single-floored gallery make a polygon. What is the\nsmallest number of stationary guards needed to ensure that every point\nof the gallery wall can be seen by a guard? If the polygon is convex\n(all interior angles < 180°), one guard will suffice, as guards\nmay rotate. But if the polygon is not convex, as in Figure 18, one\nguard may not be enough. Figure 18 Chvátal’s theorem gives the answer: for a gallery with\n\\(n\\) walls, \\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) guards suffice, where\n\\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) is the greatest integer \\(\\le n/3\\). (If\nthis does not sound to you sufficiently like a mathematical theorem,\nit can be restated as follows: Let \\(S\\) be a subset of the Euclidean\nplane. For a subset \\(B\\) of \\(S\\) let us say that \\(B\\)\nsupervises \\(S\\) iff for each \\(x \\in S\\) there is a \\(y \\in\nB\\) such that the segment \\(xy\\) lies within \\(S\\). Then the smallest\nnumber \\(f(n)\\) such that every set bounded by a simple \\(n\\)-gon is\nsupervised by a set of \\(f(n)\\) points is at most \\(\\llcorner\nn/3.\\lrcorner\\) Here is Steve Fisk’s proof. A short induction shows that\nevery polygon can be triangulated, i.e., non-crossing edges between\nnon-adjacent vertices (“diagonals”) can be added so that\nthe polygon is entirely composed of non-overlapping triangles. So take\nany \\(n\\)-sided polygon with a fixed triangulation. Think of it as a\ngraph, a set of vertices and connected edges, as in Figure 19. Figure 19 The first part of the proof shows that the graph is 3-colourable,\ni.e., every vertex can be coloured with one of just three colours\n(red, white and blue, say) so that no edge connects vertices of the\nsame colour. The argument proceeds by induction on \\(n \\ge 3\\), the number of\nvertices. For \\(n = 3\\) it is trivial. Assume it holds for all \\(k\\), where\n\\(3 \\le k < n\\). Let triangulated polygon \\(G\\) have \\(n\\) vertices. Let \\(u\\) and\n\\(v\\) be any two vertices connected by diagonal edge \\(uv\\). The\ndiagonal \\(uv\\) splits \\(G\\) into two smaller graphs, both containing\n\\(uv\\). Give \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) different colours, say red and white, as\nin Figure 20. Figure 20 By the inductive assumption, we may colour each of the smaller\ngraphs with the three colours so that no edge joins vertices of the\nsame colour, keeping fixed the colours of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).  Pasting\ntogether the two smaller graphs as coloured gives us a 3-colouring of\nthe whole graph. What remains is to show that \\(\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\) or fewer\nguards can be placed on vertices so that every triangle is in the view\nof a guard. Let \\(b\\), \\(r\\) and \\(w\\) be the number of vertices\ncoloured blue, red and white respectively. Let \\(b\\) be minimal in\n\\(\\{b, r, w\\}\\). Then \\(b \\le r\\) and \\(b \\le w\\). Then \\(2b \\le r +\nw\\). So \\(3b \\le b + r + w = n\\). So \\(b \\le n/3\\) and so \\(b \\le\n\\llcorner n/3\\lrcorner\\). Place a guard on each blue vertex. Done.  The central idea of this proof, or the proof strategy, is\nclear. While the actual diagrams produced here are superfluous to the\nproof, some visualizing enables us to grasp the central idea. Thinking which involves the use of seen or visualized images, which\nmay be static or moving, is widespread in mathematical practice. Such\nvisual thinking may constitute a non-superfluous and non-replaceable\npart of thinking through a specific proof. But there is a real danger\nof over-generalisation when using images, which we need to guard\nagainst, and in some contexts, such as real and complex analysis, the\napparent soundness of a diagrammatic inference is liable to be\nillusory. Even when visual thinking does not contribute to proving a\nmathematical truth, it may enable one to discover a truth,\nwhere to discover a truth is to come to believe it in an independent,\nreliable and rational way. Visual thinking can also play a large role\nin discovering a central idea for a proof or a proof-strategy; and in\ndiscovering a kind of mathematical entity or a mathematical\nproperty. The (non-superfluous) use of visual thinking in coming to know a\nmathematical truth does in some cases introduce an a\nposteriori element into the way one comes to know it, resulting\nin a posteriori mathematical knowledge. This is not as\nrevolutionary as it may sound as a truth knowable a\nposteriori may also be knowable a priori. More\ninteresting is the possibility that one can acquire some mathematical\nknowledge in a way in which visual thinking is essential but does not\ncontribute evidence; in this case the role of the visual thinking may\nbe to activate one’s prior cognitive resources. This opens the\npossibility that non-superfluous visual thinking may result in a\npriori knowledge of a mathematical truth. Visual thinking may contribute to understanding in more than one\nway. Visual illustrations may be extremely useful in providing\nexamples and non-examples of analytic concepts, thus helping to\nsharpen our grasp of those concepts. Also, visual thinking\naccompanying a proof may deepen our understanding of the proof, giving\nus an awareness of the direction of the proof so that, as Hermann Weyl\nput it, we are not forced to traverse the steps blindly, link by link,\nfeeling our way by touch.","contact.mail":"m.giaquinto@ucl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"ucl.ac.uk"}]
