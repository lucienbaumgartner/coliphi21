He converted to Catholicism in 1929 and his\nphilosophy was later described as “Christian\nExistentialism” (most famously in Jean-Paul Sartre’s\n“Existentialism is a Humanism”) a term he initially\nendorsed but later repudiated. In addition to his numerous\nphilosophical publications, he was the author of some thirty dramatic\nworks. Marcel gave the Gifford Lectures in Aberdeen in\n1949–1950, which appeared in print as the two-volume The\nMystery of Being, and the William James Lectures at Harvard in\n1961–1962, which were collected and published as The\nExistential Background of Human Dignity.\n\nMarcel was born in 1889. His mother died when he was only four, and\nMarcel was raised by his father and aunt, who later married. He\nexcelled in school, but did so without enjoying his studies prior to\nhis encounter with philosophy. He associated with many of the\nprominent philosophers of his day, in part due to his hosting of the\nfamous “Friday evenings.” Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas,\nJean Wahl, Simone de Beauvoir, Nicolas Berdyaev and Jean-Paul Sartre\nwere among the many noted philosophers who attended these gatherings\nat one time or another. These informal meetings were an occasion for\nengaged thinkers from a variety of perspectives to discuss together\nvarious philosophical themes, frequently ones Marcel himself was\nworking on that week. After passing his agrégation in\n1910, he taught philosophy intermittently in Sens, Paris, and\nMontpellier; however, his main professional occupations were that of\ndrama critic (for Europe nouvelle and later for Nouvelles\nlittéraires) and editor (for the Feux\ncroisés series at Plon). \nMarcel’s philosophical legacy includes lectures, journal entries\nand dramatic works in addition to more orthodox philosophical\nexpression in essays and monographs. Of these various genres, Marcel\nwas perhaps most pleased with his dramatic works. In fact, reading\nbetween the lines of his autobiographical remarks, one can discern\nsome puzzlement and no small amount of frustration at the success of\nhis philosophical works and the relative obscurity of his dramatic\nworks. Complicating the diverse expression of his ideas is the fact\nthat Marcel was a consciously unsystematic philosopher, something he\nrealized as early as the publication of his Journal\nmétaphysique (1927).\n [1]\n Nevertheless, while the diverse expression of his thought and the\nrelated lack of systematicity cause some difficulty for those\ninterested in Marcel’s work, the main themes of his thought are\npresent in many of his works. Especially noteworthy are: The\nMystery of Being, Creative Fidelity, Homo Viator,\nBeing and Having, Tragic Wisdom and Beyond and the\nconcise “On the Ontological Mystery.” \nMarcel’s philosophical methodology was unique, although it bears\nsome resemblance to both existentialism and phenomenology broadly\nconstrued. He insisted that philosophy begin with concrete experience\nrather than abstractions. To this end he makes constant use of\nexamples in order to ground the philosophical ideas he is\ninvestigating. The method itself consists in “working…up\nfrom life to thought and then down from thought to life again, so that\n[one] may try to throw more light upon life” (Marcel 1951a, p.\n41). Thus, this philosophy is a sort of “description bearing\nupon the structures which reflection elucidates starting from\nexperience” (Marcel 1962a, p. 180). In addition, Marcel\nexpressed a refreshing preference for philosophizing in ordinary\nlanguage. He maintained that “we should employ current forms of\nordinary language which distort our experiences far less than the\nelaborate expressions in which philosophical language is\ncrystallized” (Marcel 1965, p. 158). \nIn line with his preference for concrete philosophy that speaks in\nordinary language, Marcel begins many of his philosophical essays with\nan observation about life. One of his central observations about life\nand experience, from which he is able to derive many of the\nphilosophical distinctions that follow, is that we live in a\n“broken world.” A world in which “ontological\nexigence”—if it is acknowledged at all—is\nsilenced by an unconscious relativism or by a monism that discounts\nthe personal, “ignores the tragic and denies the\ntranscendent” (Marcel 1995, p. 15). The characterization of the\nworld as broken does not necessarily imply that there was a time when\nthe world was intact. It would be more correct to emphasize that the\nworld we live in is essentially broken, broken in essence, in addition\nto having been further fractured by events in history. The observation\nis intended to point out that we find ourselves hic et nunc\nin a world that is broken. This situation is characterized by a\nrefusal (or inability) to reflect, a refusal to imagine and a denial\nof the transcendent (Marcel 1951a, pp. 36–37). Although many\nthings contribute to the “brokenness” of the world, the\nhallmark of its modern manifestation is “the misplacement of the\nidea of function” (Marcel 1995, p. 11). \n“I should like to start,” Marcel says, “with a sort\nof global and intuitive characterization of the man in whom the sense\nof the ontological—the sense of being, is lacking, or, to speak\nmore correctly, the man who has lost awareness of this sense”\n(Marcel 1995, p. 9). This person, the one who has lost awareness of\nthe sense of the ontological, the one whose capacity to wonder has\natrophied to the extent of becoming a vestigial trait, is an example\nof the influence of the misapplication of the idea of function. Marcel\nuses the example of a subway token distributor. This person has a job\nthat is mindless, repetitive, and monotonous. The same function can\nbe, and often is, completed by automated machines. All day this person\ntakes bills from commuters and returns a token and some change,\nrepeating the same process with the same denominations of currency,\nover and over. The other people with whom she interacts engage her in\nonly the most superficial and distant manner. In most cases, they do\nnot speak to her and they do not make eye contact. In fact, the only\ndistinction the commuters make between such a person and the\nautomatic, mechanical token dispenser down the hall is to note which\n“machine” has the shorter line. The way in which these\ncommuters interact with this subway employee is clearly superficial\nand less than desirable. However, Marcel’s point is more\nsubtle. \nWhat can the inner reality of such a person be like? What began as\ntedious work slowly becomes infuriating in its monotony, but\neventually passes into a necessity that is accepted with indifference,\nuntil even the sense of dissatisfaction with the pure functionalism of\nthe task is lost. The unfortunate truth is that such a person may come\nto see herself, at first unconsciously, as merely an amalgamation of\nthe functions she performs. There is the function of dispensing tokens\nat work, the function of spouse and parent at home, the function of\nvoting as a citizen of a given country, etc. Her life operates on a\nseries of “time-tables” that indicate when certain\nfunctions—such as the yearly maintenance trip to the doctor, or\nthe yearly vacation to rest and recuperate—are to be exercised.\nIn this person the sense of wonder and the exigence for the\ntranscendent may slowly begin to wither and die. In the most extreme\ncases, a person who has come to identify herself with her functions\nceases to even have any intuition that the world is broken. \nA corollary of the functionalism of the modern broken world is its\nhighly technical nature. Marcel characterizes a world such as\nours—in which everything and everyone becomes viewed in terms of\nfunction, and in which all questions are approached with\ntechnique—as one that is dominated by its\n“technics.” This is evident in the dependence on\ntechnology, the immediate deferral to the technological as the answer\nto any problem, and the tendency to think of technical reasoning as\nthe only mode of access to the truth. However, it is clear that there\nare some “problems” that cannot be addressed with\ntechnique, and this is disquieting for persons who have come to rely\non technics. While technology undoubtedly has its proper place and\nuse, the deification of technology leads to despair when we realize\nthe ultimate inefficacy of technics regarding important existential\nquestions. It is precisely this misapplication of the idea of function\nand the dependence on technics that leads to the despair that is so\nprevalent in the broken world. Obviously, we cannot turn back the\nclock with regard to technological progress, and Marcel acknowledges\nthat technology is not necessarily detrimental to the life of the\nspirit; nevertheless, it often is, because: “does not the\ninvasion of our life by techniques today tend to substitute\nsatisfaction at a material level for spiritual joy, dissatisfaction at\na material level for spiritual disquiet?” (Marcel 1985, p.\n57). \n“What defines man,” claims Marcel, “are his\nexigencies” (Marcel 1973, p. 34). Nevertheless, these\nexigencies can be smothered, perhaps even silenced, by\ndespair. Such is the case in the example of the\n“functionalized” person. The broken world can smother\ntranscendent exigencies, leaving only quotidian, functional\nneeds intact. Ontological exigence, the need for\ntranscendence, is linked to a certain dissatisfaction—one that\nis all the more troubling because one is unable to soothe this\ndissatisfaction by one’s own powers. However, without a feeling\nthat something is amiss, without the feeling of dissatisfaction,\nontological exigence withers. This is why the functional\nperson, the person who no longer even notices that the world is\nbroken, is described as having lost the awareness of the ontological\nand the need for transcendence. In the face of this potential despair,\nMarcel claims that: \nThus, ontological exigence is a need and a demand for some\nlevel of coherence in the cosmos and for some understanding of our\nplace and role within this coherence. It is the combination of wonder\nand the attendant desire, not to understand the entire cosmos, but to\nunderstand something of one’s own place in\n it.[4]\n Note that, for Marcel, ontological exigence is not merely a\n“wish” for being or coherence, but is an “interior\nurge” or “appeal.” “Otherwise stated, the\n[ontological] exigence is not reducible to some psychological state,\nmood, or attitude a person has; it is rather a movement of\nthe human spirit that is inseparable from being human” (Keen\n1984, p. 105). \nMarcel is very clear that the term “transcendence” has, in\nhis view, become degraded in modern philosophy. Transcendence cannot\nmean merely “going beyond” without any further\nspecification. It must retain the tension of the traditional\ndistinction between the immanent and the transcendent, one that\nemphasizes a vertical rather than a horizontal going beyond, a\ntranscendence toward a height, a\n trans-ascendence.[5]\n Although the transcendent is juxtaposed with the immanent, Marcel\ninsists that “transcendent” cannot mean\n“transcending experience.” “There must exist a\npossibility of having an experience of the transcendent as such, and\nunless that possibility exists the word can have no meaning”\n(Marcel 1951a, p. 46). The tendency to discount the idea of\nexperiencing transcendence is the result of an objective view of\nexperience. However, experience is not an object and therefore it\ncannot be viewed objectively. Speaking metaphorically, the essence of\nexperience is not an “absorbing into oneself,” as in the\ncase of taste, but “a straining oneself towards something, as\nwhen, for instance, during the night we attempt to get a distinct\nperception of some far-off noise” (Marcel 1951a, p. 47). Thus,\nwhile Marcel insists on the possibility of experiencing the\ntranscendent, he does not thereby mean that the transcendent is\ncomprehensible. \nMarcel discusses being in a variety of contexts; however, one of the\nmore illustrative points of entry into this issue is the distinction\nbetween being and\n having.[6]\n In some cases this distinction is one that is obvious and therefore\nnot particularly illuminating. For example, most people would readily\nacknowledge a difference between having a house and being hospitable.\nHowever, there are other cases where the distinction between having\nsomething and being something is much more significant. For example,\nwhen we hope, we do not have hope. We are hope.\nSimilarly, we do not have a belief. We are a belief. \nMarcel’s hallmark illustration of being and having is one that\nactually straddles the distinction between them: “my\nbody.” My body, insofar as it is my body, is both\nsomething that I have and something that I am, and cannot be\nadequately accounted for using either of these descriptions alone. I\ncan look at my body in a disassociated manner and see it\ninstrumentally. However, in doing so, in distancing myself from it in\norder to grasp it qua object, qua something I have,\nit ceases to be “my” body. I can have “a”\nbody, but not “my” body. As soon as I make the connection\nthat the body in question is my body, not a body, it can no longer be\nsomething that I have pure and simple—this body also is me, it\nis what I am. On the other hand, it cannot be said that I simply am my\nbody either. I can dispose of my body in certain circumstances by\ntreating it instrumentally. A person who loses a limb in an accident\nis not less of a person and, therefore, there is a sense in which our\nbodies are objects that we have. \nThe ambiguous role played by my body not only points out the\ndistinction between being and having, but also shows that we relate to\nother things and persons differently in these two modes. Having\ncorresponds to things that are completely external to me. I have\nthings that I possess, that I can dispose of—and this should\nmake it clear that I cannot “have,” for example, another\nperson. Having implies this possession because “having always\nimplies an obscure notion of assimilation” (Marcel 1949, p. 83).\nWhile the encounter with otherness takes place in terms of\nassimilation when speaking of having, the encounter with otherness\n(e.g., other persons) can also take place on the level of being. In\nthis case Marcel maintains that the encounter is not one that is\npurely external and, as such, it is played out in terms of presence\nand participation rather than assimilation. \nBoth being and having are legitimate ways to encounter things in the\nworld; however, the misapplication of these two modes of comportment\ncan have disastrous consequences. \nThe notion that we live in a broken world is used—along with the\nperson who is characteristic of the broken world, the functionalized\nperson—to segue into one of Marcel’s central thematic\ndistinctions: the distinction between problem and mystery. He states\nthat the broken world is one that is “on the one hand, riddled\nwith problems and, on the other, determined to allow no room for\nmystery” (Marcel 1995, p. 12). The denial of the mysterious is\nsymptomatic of the modern broken world and is tied to its technical\ncharacter, which only acknowledges that which technique can address:\nthe problematic. The distinction between problem and mystery is one\nthat hinges, like much of Marcel’s thought, on the notion of\nparticipation. \nA problem is a question in which I am not involved, in which the\nidentity of the person asking the question is not an issue. In the\nrealm of the problematic, it makes no difference who is asking the\nquestion because all of the relevant information is\n“before” the questioner. As such, a problem is something\nthat bars my way, placing an obstacle in front of me that must be\novercome. In turn, the overcoming of a problem inevitably involves\nsome technique, a technique that could be, and often is, employed by\nany other person confronting the same problem. Thus the identity of\nthe questioner can be changed without altering the problem itself.\nThis is why the modern broken world only sees the problematic: the\n‘problematic’ is that which can be addressed and solved\nwith a technique, e.g., changing a flat tire on an automobile or\ndownloading security software to fix a virus on one’s\ncomputer. \nMarcel often describes a mystery as a “problem that encroaches\non its own data” (Marcel 1995, p. 19). Such a\n“problem” is, in fact, meta-problematic; it is a question\nin which the identity of the questioner becomes an issue\nitself—where, in fact, the questioner is involved in the\nquestion he or she is asking. On the level of the mysterious, the\nidentity of the questioner is tied to the question and, therefore, the\nquestioner is not interchangeable. To change the questioner would be\nto alter the question. It makes every difference who is asking the\nquestion when confronting a mystery. Here, on the level of the\nmysterious, the distinctions “in-me” and\n“before-me” break down. Marcel insists that mysteries can\nbe found in the question of Being (e.g., my ontological\nexigence), the union of the body and soul, the\n“problem” of evil and—perhaps the archetypal\nexamples of mystery—freedom and love. For example, I cannot\nquestion Being as if my being is not at issue in the questioning. The\nquestion of being and the question of who I am (my being) cannot be\naddressed separately. These two questions are somehow incoherent if\napproached as problems; however, taken together, their mysterious\ncharacter is revealed and they cancel themselves out qua\nproblems. \nAnother example is the “problem of evil” (Marcel, 1995,\npp. 19-20). Marcel distinguishes between what philosophers refer to as\nthe existential problem of evil (how a particular individual responds\nto an experience of evil in his or her own life), and the\nphilosophical problem of evil (how a philosopher might think about the\n“problem” of evil—how evil is to be reconciled with\nthe existence of an all-good and all-powerful God, for instance). He\nnotes that the existential problem cannot be fully discussed at the\nphilosophical level precisely because the experience of the questioner\nis left out. He notes that, “Evil which is only stated or\nobserved is no longer evil which is suffered: in fact, it ceases to be\nevil. In reality, I can only grasp it as evil in the measure in which\nit touches me—that is to say, in the measure in which I\nam involved…being ‘involved’ is the\nfundamental fact” (Marcel, 1995, p. 19). In addition, the\nphilosopher seeks solutions to the problem of evil that can be\npresented to everyone in a logically objective manner, so almost by\ndefinition these solutions cannot fully address the existential\nquestion. Marcel also proposes that sometimes philosophers can fall\ninto the error of thinking that the philosophical problem should be\nthe main way to approach the experience of evil, and as a result can\nfail to appreciate the necessity of helping people deal with the\nexistential problem. In general, this failure is something we can\nobserve in many different areas of primary reflection, including\nacademic disciplines, which sometimes lose touch with the experiences\nthat gave rise to the problems the disciplines are supposed to be\naddressing. \nUnlike problems, mysteries are not solved with techniques and\ntherefore cannot be answered the same way by different\npersons—one technique, one solution, will not apply in the\ndifferent cases presented by different persons. Indeed, it is\nquestionable if mysteries are open to “solutions” at all.\nNevertheless, it would be incorrect to call the mysterious a gap in\nour knowledge in the same way that a problem is. “The mysterious\nis not the unknowable, the unknowable is only the limiting case of the\nproblematic” (Marcel 1949, p. 118). \nAlthough a mystery may be insoluble, it is not senseless; and while\nits inexpressibility makes it difficult to fully describe in\ncommunicable knowledge, it can still be spoken of in a suggestive way\n(Marcel 1964, xxv). Marcel notes in a journal entry dated December\n18th, 1932 that: \nReferring back to the idea of a broken world, the technical and the\nproblematic are questions that are addressed with only\n“part” of a person. The full person is not engaged in the\ntechnical because a person’s self, her identity, is not at\nissue. “At the root of having [and problems, and technics] there\nlies a certain specialization of specification of the self, and this\nis connected with [a] partial alienation of the self…”\n(Marcel 1949, p. 172). Problems are addressed impersonally, in a\ndetached manner, while mysteries demand participation, involvement.\nAlthough some problems can be reflected on in such a way that they\nbecome mysterious, all mysteries can be reflected on in such a way\nthat the mystery is degraded and becomes merely problematic. \nThe distinction between two kinds of questions—problem and\nmystery—brings to light two different kinds of thinking or\nreflection. The problematic is addressed with thinking that is\ndetached and technical, while the mysterious is encountered in\nreflection that is involved, participatory and decidedly\nnon-technical. Marcel calls these two kinds of thinking\n“primary” and “secondary” reflection. Primary\nreflection examines its object by abstraction, by analytically\nbreaking it down into its constituent parts. It is concerned with\ndefinitions, essences and technical solutions to problems. In\ncontrast, secondary reflection is synthetic; it unifies rather than\ndivides. “Roughly, we can say that where primary reflection\ntends to dissolve the unity of experience which is first put before\nit, the function of secondary reflection is essentially recuperative;\nit reconquers that unity” (Marcel 1951a, p. 83). \nIn the most general sense, reflection is nothing other than attention\nbrought to bear on something. However, different objects require\ndifferent kinds of reflection. In keeping with their respective\napplication to problem and mystery, primary reflection is directed at\nthat which is outside of me or “before me,” while\nsecondary reflection is directed at that which is not merely before\nme—that is, either that which is in me, which I am, or those\nareas where the distinctions “in me” and “before\nme” tend to break down. The parallels between having and being,\nproblem and mystery, and primary and secondary reflection are clear,\neach pair helping to illuminate the others. \nThus, secondary reflection is one important aspect of our access to\nthe self. It is the properly philosophical mode of reflection because,\nin Marcel’s view, philosophy must return to concrete situations\nif it is to merit the name “philosophy.” These difficult\nreflections are “properly philosophical” insofar as they\nlead to a more truthful, more intimate communication with both myself\nand with any other person whom these reflections include (Marcel\n1951a, pp. 79–80). Secondary reflection, which recoups the unity\nof experience, points the way toward a fuller understanding of the\nparticipation alluded to in examples of the mysterious. \nAlthough secondary reflection is able to recoup the unity of\nexperience that primary reflection dissects, it is possible that\nsecondary reflection can be frustrated. One example of the frustration\nof secondary reflection and the mysterious is the functional person;\nhowever, this is really just one example of a more general phenomenon:\nthe person who has given in to the “spirit of\nabstraction.” When we engage in primary reflection without\nproceeding to the synthesizing, recollecting act of secondary\nreflection, we fall victim to what Marcel calls the spirit of\nabstraction. “As soon as we accord to any category, isolated\nfrom all other categories, an arbitrary primacy, we are victims of the\nspirit of abstraction” (Marcel 1962b, pp.\n 155–156).[7] \nAbstraction, which is in essence the kind of thinking that\ncharacterizes primary reflection, is not always bad per se. However,\nneither is it, always an “essentially intellectual”\noperation (Marcel 1962b, p. 156). That is, contrary to what the\nsuccesses of science and technology might tell us, we may succumb to\nthe spirit of abstraction out of passional reasons rather than\nintellectual expediency. Abstraction—which is always abstraction\nfrom an embodied, concrete existence—can overcome our concrete\nexistence and we may come to view abstracted elements of existence as\nif they were independent. As Marcel describes it: “it can happen\nthat the mind, yielding to a sort of fascination, ceases to be aware\nof these prior conditions that justify abstraction and deceives itself\nabout the nature of what is, in itself, nothing more than a\nmethod” (Marcel 1962b, p. 156). The significance of this\nphenomenon for Marcel would be difficult to overstate—indeed, in\nMan Against Mass Society, Marcel argues that the spirit of\nabstraction is inherently disingenuous and violent, and a significant\nfactor in the making of war—and there is a sense in which his\nwhole philosophical project is an “obstinate and untiring battle\nagainst the spirit of abstraction” (Marcel 1962b, p.\n 1).[8] \nMarcel emphasizes two general ways of comporting ourselves towards\nothers that can be used as barometers for intersubjective\nrelationships: disponibilité and\nindisponibilité. These words—generally\ntranslated as either “availability” and\n“unavailability” or, less frequently, as\n“disposability” and\n“non-disposability”—bear meanings for Marcel that do\nnot fully come across in English. Therefore, in addition to the sense\nof availability and unavailability, Marcel suggests the addition of\nthe concepts of “handiness” and “unhandiness”\nto his English readers in an attempt to clarify his meaning. Handiness\nand unhandiness refer to the availability of one’s\n“resources”—material, emotional, intellectual and\nspiritual. Thus, the term disponibilité refers to the\nmeasure in which I am available to someone, the state of having my\nresources at hand to offer; and this availability or unavailability of\nresources is a general state or disposition. While it may appear that\nthere is the possibility of a selfish allocation of one’s\nresources, the truth is that when resources are not available, their\ninaccessibility affects both the other and the self. Marcel comments\nfrequently on the interconnected nature of the treatment of others and\nthe state of the self. \nIndisponibilité can manifest itself in any number of\nways; however, “unavailability is invariably rooted in some\nmeasure of alienation” (Marcel 1995, p. 40). Pride is an\ninstructive example of indisponibilité, although the\nsame state of non-disposability would also exist in a person who has\ncome to view herself in functional terms, or one who is blinded by a\npurely technical worldview. Pride is not an exaggerated opinion of\noneself arising from self-love, which Marcel insists is really only\nvanity; rather, pride consists in believing that one is\nself-sufficient (Marcel 1995, p. 32). It consists in drawing\none’s strength solely from oneself. “The proud man is cut\noff from a certain kind of communion with his fellow men, which pride,\nacting as a principle of destruction tends to break down. Indeed, this\ndestructiveness can be equally well directed against the\nself; pride is in no way incompatible with self-hate…”\n(Marcel 1995, p. 32). \nFor the person who is indisponible, other people are reduced\nto “examples” or “cases” of genus “other\nperson” rather than being encountered qua other as\nunique individuals. Instead of encountering the other person as a\n‘Thou’, the other is encountered as a ‘He’ or\n‘She’, or even as an ‘It’. \nWhen I treat the other person as a He or She, it is because he or she\nis kept at arm’s length but within my grasp, outside of the\ncircle that I form with myself in my cogito but inside the\ncircle of “my world.” \nWhen I treat the other person as a ‘Her’, I treat her, not\nas a presence, but as absent. However, when I treat the other as a\n‘He’ or ‘She’ rather than a\n‘Thou’, I become incapable of seeing myself as a\n‘Thou’. In deprecating the other I deprecate myself. \nIf I treat the other person as purely external to me, as a\n‘Her’, a generic Ms. X, I encounter her “in\nfragments” as it were. I encounter various aspects of the other\nperson, elements that might be used to fill out a questionnaire or\nform (name, occupation, age, etc.). I am not present to the other\nperson and I am closed off and indifferent to the presence she offers\nme. However, in encountering the other person in this manner—not\nas another person but as a case or example of certain functions, roles\nor characteristics—I myself cease to be a person, but take on\nthe role, speaking metaphorically, of the pen that would record these\ndisparate elements onto the form. Any other person could encounter the\nother in this impersonal manner. If this is the case, I myself have\nbecome interchangeable, replaceable. I have ceased to encounter her in\nthe absolutely unique communion of our two persons. This functional\nview of the other and, consequently, of the self, is a direct result\nof the “spirit of abstraction.” When the other is\nencountered as a generic case, I who encounter am myself a generic\ncase in the encounter. But the situation can be otherwise. \nIn contrast, “the characteristic of the soul which is present\nand at the disposal of others is that it cannot think in terms of\ncases; in its eyes there are no cases at all”\n(Marcel 1995, p. 41). The person who is disponible, who is\navailable or disposable to others, has an entirely different\nexperience of her place in the world: she acknowledges her\ninterdependence with other people. Relationships of\ndisponibilité are characterized by presence and\ncommunication between persons qua other, qua\nfreedom—a communication and communion between persons who\ntranscend their separation without merging into a unity, that is,\nwhile remaining separate to some degree. “It should be obvious\nat once that a being of this sort is not an autonomous whole, is not\nin [the] expressive English phrase, self-contained; on the contrary\nsuch a being is open and exposed, as unlike as can be to a compact\nimpenetrable mass” (Marcel 1951a, p. 145). To be\ndisponible to the other is to be present to and for her, to\nput one’s resources at her disposal, and to be open and\npermeable to her. \nThus, while I encounter objects in a manner that is technical and\nobjectifying, the encounter with the other person offers another,\nunique possibility: I can have a relationship “with”\nanother person. \nThe word “with,” taken with its full metaphysical\nimplication, corresponds neither to a relationship of separation and\nexteriority, nor to a relationship of unity and inherence. Rather,\n“with” expresses the essence of genuine coesse,\ni.e. of pluralism, of separation with communion (Marcel 1995, p. 39).\nAs indisponibilité is illustrated with the example of\npride, disponibilité is best illustrated in the\nrelations of love, hope and fidelity. \nMarcel—contra Kant—does not shy away from declaring that\nthe participation in a relationship “with” someone has a\nsignificant affective element. It is not knowledge of the other that\ninitially binds us to another person—though we may indeed grow\nto know something of the other—but “fraternity,” the\nsense that the other is beset by joys and sorrows common to the human\n family.[10]\n It is that which allows us, upon seeing the misfortune of another, to\nsay, “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” To go to\nsomeone’s side or to assist another out of a sense of\n“duty” is precisely not to be present to her.\n [11]\n The person who is disponible does not demure from saying\nthat she truly does desire the best for the other person and that she\ntruly desires to share something of herself with the other (Marcel\n1964, p. 154). In fact, because disponibilité is only\na philosophical way of describing what we mean by love and trust,\ndisponibilité is inconceivable without this affective\nelement. \nYet, it is not enough for one person to be disponible in\norder for the full communion of disponibilité to\noccur. It is entirely possible for one person to come to an encounter\nin a completely open and available manner, only to be rebuffed by the\ntotal unavailability of the other person. Ideally, a relationship of\navailability must include an element of reciprocity. However, the fact\nthat reciprocity is necessary in an intersubjective relationship does\nnot mean that reciprocity may be demanded of such a relationship.\nDisponibilité does not insist on its rights or make\nany claim on the other whatsoever. It is analogous to the situation of\n“a being awaiting a gift or favor from another being but only on\nthe grounds of his liberality, and that he is the first to protest\nthat the favor he is asking is a grace [que cette grâce\ndemandée est une grâce], that is to say the exact\nopposite of an obligation” (Marcel 1962a, p. 55). Nevertheless,\nthe fact that disponibilité does not demand\nreciprocity and that some kind of relationship is indeed possible\nwithout such reciprocity does not alter the fact that such reciprocity\nmust be present if the relationship is to fully flower. “One\nmight therefore say that there is a hierarchy of choices, or rather\ninvocations, ranging from the call upon another which is like ringing\na bell for a servant to quite the other sort of call which is really\nlike a kind of prayer” (Marcel 1951a, p. 179). \nMarcel characterizes disponibilité as charity bound up\nwith presence, as the gift of oneself. And therefore, at the extreme\nlimit, disponibilité would consist in a total\nspiritual availability that would be pure charity, unconditional love\nand disposability. However, a problem arises here insofar as Marcel\nhas insisted on an affective element in disponibilité.\nHow is such a gift of self possible for temporal beings, persons for\nwhom the vicissitudes of time may alter feelings or opinion of the\nother? \nMarcel draws a sharp distinction between opinion and belief. Opinion\nalways concerns that which we do not know, that with which we are not\nfamiliar. It exists in a position between impression and affirmation.\nIt is often the case that opinions have a “false” basis,\nwhich is most clear in case of stereotypes and prejudices\n(“everybody knows that…”). Furthermore, opinions\nare invariably “external” to the things to which they\nrefer. I have an opinion about something only when I disengage myself\nfrom it and hold it at “arm’s length.” Nevertheless,\nwe hold or maintain these opinions in front of others, and given the\nelusive foundations on which these opinions are based, it is easy to\nsee how an opinion slides slowly from an impression we have to a claim\nthat we make. This transition invariably takes place as part of an\nabsence of reflection on the given subject and the entrenchment of the\nopinion due to repetition. Our opinions are often\n“unshakable” precisely because of the lack of reflection\nassociated with them. \nWhile opinions are unreflective and external, convictions—which\nare more akin to belief than opinion—are the result of extensive\nreflection and invariably concern things to which one feels closely\ntied. Like opinions that have entrenched themselves to the point of\nbecoming actual claims, convictions are felt to be definitive, beyond\nmodification. However, when I claim that nothing can change my\nconviction, I must either affirm that I have already anticipated all\npossible future scenarios and no possible event can change my\nconviction, or affirm that whatever events do occur—anticipated\nor unanticipated—they will not shake my conviction. The first\npossibility is impossible. The second possibility is based on a\ndecision, a decision to remain constant whatever may come. However,\nupon reflection such a decision seems as over-confidant as the claim\nto have anticipated the future. By what right can I affirm that my\ninner conviction will not change in any circumstance? To do so is to\nimply that, in the future, I will cease to reflect on my conviction.\nIt seems that all I am able to say is that my conviction is such that,\nat the present moment, I cannot imagine an alteration in it. \nBelief is akin to conviction; it is, however, distinguished by its\nobject. Marcel insists in many places that proper use of the term\n“belief” applies not to things “that” we\nbelieve, but to things “in which” we believe. Belief is\nnot “belief that…” but is “belief\nin…” Belief that might be better characterized\nas a conviction rather than a belief; however, to believe in\nsomething is to extend credit to it, to place something at the\ndisposal of that in which we believe. The notion of credit placed at\nthe disposal of the other is another way of speaking about\ndisponibilité. “I am in no way separable from\nthat which I place at the disposal of this X…\nActually, the credit I extend is, in a way, myself. I lend myself to\nX. We should note at once that this is an essentially\nmysterious act” (Marcel 1951a, p. 134). This is what\ndistinguishes conviction from belief. Conviction refers to the\nX, takes a position with regard to X, but does not\nbind itself to X. While I have an opinion, I\nam a belief—for belief changes the way I am in the\nworld, changes my being. We can now see how belief refers to the\nother, and how it is connected to disponibilité:\nbelief always applies to “personal or supra-personal\nreality” (Marcel 1951a, p. 135). It always involves a thou to\nwhom I extend credit—a credit that puts myself at the disposal\nof the thou—and thus arises the problem of\n fidelity.[12] \nThe discussion of “creative fidelity” is an excellent\nplace to find a unification, or at least a conjunction, of the various\nthemes and ideas in Marcel’s non-systematic thought. Ontological\nexigence, being, mystery, second reflection, and\ndisponibilité all inform the discussion of creative\nfidelity, which in turn attempts to illustrate how we can experience\nthese mysterious realities in more or less concrete terms. \nThe “problem” posed by fidelity is that of constancy.\nHowever, fidelity—a belief in someone—requires presence in\naddition to constancy over time, and presence implies an affective\nelement. Mere constancy over time is not enough because “a\nfulfillment of on obligation contre-coeur is devoid of love\nand cannot be identified with fidelity” (Marcel 1964, xxii).\nThus, the question is posed as follows. How are we able to remain\ndisponible over time? How can we provide a guarantee of our\n“belief in” someone? Perhaps the best way to address this\ncomplex idea is to address its constituent parts: the problem posed by\nfidelity and the answer given by creativity. \nThe extension of credit to another is a commitment, an act whereby I\ncommit myself and place myself at the disposal of the other. In\nextending credit to the other I am also placing my trust in her,\nimplicitly hoping that she proves worthy of the credit I extend to\nher. However, we sometimes misjudge others in thinking too highly of\nthem and at other times misjudge by underestimation. Recalling that\nthere is an affective element of spontaneity involved in\ndisponibilité, how can I assure that I will remain\nfaithful to my present belief in the other? Like the question of\nconviction over time, my present fidelity to another can be questioned\nin terms of its durability. Though I presently feel inclined to credit\nthe other, to put myself at her disposal, how can I assure that this\nfeeling will not change tomorrow, next month, or next year?\nFurthermore, because I have given myself to this other person, placed\nmyself at her disposal, when she falls short of my hopes for\nher—hopes implicit in my extension of credit to her—I am\nwounded. \nHowever, the “failure” of the other to conform to my hopes\nis not necessarily the fault of the other. My disappointment or injury\nis frequently the result of my having assigned some definite,\ndeterminate quality to the other person or defined her in terms of\ncharacteristics that, it turns out, she does not possess. However, by\nwhat right do I assign this characteristic to her, and by what right\ndo I judge her to be wanting? Such a judgment drastically\noversteps—or perhaps falls short of—the bounds of\ndisponibilité. In doing so, it demonstrates clearly\nthat I, from the outset, was engaged in a relationship to my idea\nof the other—which has proved to be wrong—rather than\nwith the other herself. That is to say that this encounter\nwas not with the other, but with myself. If I am injured by the\nfailure of the other to conform to an idea that I had of her, this is\nnot indicative of a defect in the other; it is the result of my\ninappropriate attempt to determine her by insisting that she conform\nto my idea. When I begin to doubt my commitment to another person, the\nvulnerability of my “belief in X” to these doubts\nis directly proportional to the residue of opinion still in it (Marcel\n1964, p. 136). \nNevertheless, practically speaking, there are innumerable times when\nmy hopes for the other are not in fact met, when my extension of\ncredit to the other—which is nothing less then the disposability\nof myself—results only in a demand for “more” by the\nother. Such situations invariably tempt me to reevaluate the credit I\nhave put at the disposal of the other and to reassert the question of\ndurability concerning the affective element of my availability to the\nother. Thus, again, the mystery of fidelity is also the question of\ncommitment, of commitment over time \n“How can I test the initial assurance that is somehow the ground\nof my fidelity? …this appears to lead to a vicious circle. In\nprinciple, to commit myself I must know myself, but the fact is I\nreally only know myself when I have committed myself” (Marcel\n1964, p. 163). However, what appears to be a vicious circle from an\nexternal point of view is experienced from within, by the person who\nis disponible, as a growth and an ascending. Reflection\nqua primary reflection attempts to make the experience of\ncommitment understandable in general terms that would be applicable to\nanyone, but this can only subvert and destroy the reality of\ncommitment, which is essentially personal and therefore, accessible\nonly to secondary reflection. \nReturning to the question of durability over time, Marcel insists\nthat, if there is a possible “assurance” of fidelity, it\nis because “disposability and creativity are related\nideas” (Marcel 1964, p. 53). To be disposable is to believe in\nthe other, to place myself at her disposal and to maintain the\nopenness of disponibilité. “Creative\nfidelity” consists in actively maintaining ourselves in a state\nof openness and permeability, in willing ourselves to remain\nopen to the other and open to the influx of the presence of the\nother. \nThe truest fidelity is creative, that is, a fidelity that\ncreates the self in order to meet the demands of fidelity.\nSuch fidelity interprets the vicissitudes of “belief\nin…” as a temptation to infidelity and sees them in terms\nof a test of the self rather than in terms of a betrayal by the\nother—if fidelity fails, it is my failure rather than the\nfailure of the other. \nHowever, this merely puts off the question of durability over time.\nWhere does one find the strength to continue to create oneself and\nmeet the demands of fidelity? The fact is that, on the hither side of\nthe ontological affirmation—and the attendant appeal of\nHope—fidelity is always open to doubt. I can always call into\nquestion the reality of the bond that links me to another person,\nalways begin to doubt the presence of the person to whom I am\nfaithful, substituting for her presence an idea of my own making. On\nthe other hand, the more disposed I am toward the ontological\naffirmation, to the affirmation of Being, the more I am inclined to\nsee the failure of fidelity as my failure, resulting from my\ninsufficiency rather than that of the other. \nThus, creative fidelity invariably touches upon hope. The only way in\nwhich an unbounded commitment on the part of the subject is\nconceivable is if it draws strength from something more than itself,\nfrom an appeal to something greater, something transcendent—and\nthis appeal is hope. Can hope provide us with a foundation that allows\nhumans—who are radically contingent, frequently fickle, and\ngenerally weak—to make a commitment that is unconditional?\nMarcel acknowledges, “Perhaps it should further be said that in\nfact fidelity can never be unconditional, except where it is Faith,\nbut we must add, however, that it aspires to unconditionality”\n(Marcel 1962a, p. 133). \nHope is the final guarantor of fidelity; it is that which allows me\nnot to despair, that which gives me the strength to continue to create\nmyself in availability to the other. But this might appear to be\nnothing more than optimism—frequently misplaced, as events too\noften reveal—that things will turn out for the best. Marcel\ninsists that this is not the case. Following now familiar\ndistinctions, he makes a differentiation between the realm of fear and\ndesire on one hand and the realm of despair and hope on the other. \nFear and desire are anticipatory and focused respectively on the\nobject of fear or desire. To desire is “to desire that\nX” and to fear is “to fear that\nX.” Optimism exists in the domain of fear and desire\nbecause it imagines and anticipates a favorable outcome. However, the\nessence of hope is not “to hope that X”, but\nmerely “to hope…” The person who hopes does not\naccept the current situation as final; however, neither does she\nimagine or anticipate the circumstance that would deliver her from her\nplight, rather she merely hopes for deliverance. The more hope\ntranscends any anticipation of the form that deliverance would take,\nthe less it is open to the objection that, in many cases, the\nhoped-for deliverance does not take place. If I desire that my disease\nbe cured by a given surgical procedure, it is very possible that my\ndesire might be thwarted. However, if I simply maintain myself in\nhope, no specific event (or absence of event) need shake me from this\nhope. \nThis does not mean, however, that hope is inert or passive. Hope is\nnot stoicism. Stoicism is merely the resignation of a solitary\nconsciousness. Hope is neither resigned, nor solitary. “Hope\nconsists in asserting that there is at the heart of being, beyond all\ndata, beyond all inventories and all calculations, a mysterious\nprinciple which is in connivance with me” (Marcel 1995, p. 28).\nWhile hope is patient and expectant, it remains active; and as such it\nmight be characterized as an “active patience.” The\nassertion contained in hope reveals a kinship with willing rather than\ndesiring. “Inert hope” would be an oxymoron. \nFinally, it should be no surprise that “speaking metaphysically,\nthe only genuine hope is hope in what does not depend on ourselves,\nhope springing from humility and not from pride” (Marcel 1995,\np. 32). And here is found yet another aspect of the withering that\ntakes place as a result of indisponibilité in general\nand pride in particular. The same arrogance that keeps the proud\nperson from communion with her fellows keeps her from hope. \nThis example points to the dialectical engagement of despair and\nhope—where there is hope there is always the possibility of\ndespair, and only where there is the possibility of despair can we\nrespond with hope. Despair, says Marcel, is equivalent to saying that\nthere is nothing in the whole of reality to which I can extend credit,\nnothing worthwhile. “Despair is possible in any form, at any\nmoment and to any degree, and this betrayal may seem to be counseled,\nif not forced upon us, by the very structure of the world we live\nin” (Marcel 1995, p. 26). Hope is the affirmation that is the\nresponse to this denial. Where despair denies that anything in reality\nis worthy of credit, hope affirms that reality will ultimately prove\nworthy of an infinite credit, the complete engagement and disposal of\nmyself. \nThroughout the course of his work, Marcel arrived at an essentially\ntheistic, specifically Christian, worldview, leading many to describe\nhim as a Christian or theistic existentialist (especially in\nopposition to Sartre). Indeed, some thinkers regard Marcel’s\nphilosophical writings on religious belief as his most profound\ncontribution to philosophy: “From the beginning of his\nphilosophical career, Marcel’s main interest has been the\ninterpretation of religious experience, that is, of the relation\nbetween man and ultimate reality” (Cain, 1979, p. 87).\nMarcel’s early reflections, especially in Being and\nHaving, laid the seeds for his conversion to Catholicism at the\nage of 40, though he believed that his philosophical ideas, and\ncentral Christian themes, though complementary, were in fact\nindependent of each other: “It is quite possible that the\nexistence of the fundamental Christian data may be necessary in\nfact to enable the mind to conceive some of the notions which I\nhave attempted to analyze; but these notions cannot be said to depend\non the data of Christianity, and they do not presuppose it .\n. . I have experienced [the development of these ideas] more than\ntwenty years before I had the remotest thought of becoming a\nCatholic” (Marcel, 1995, pp. 44-45). Marcel became a Catholic\nwhen the French novelist, François Mauriac (1885--1979),\nrecognized various themes in his writing concerning commitment,\nforgiveness, moral character and the religious justification of the\nmoral order. Mauriac wrote to Marcel and explicitly asked him whether\nhe ought not to join the Catholic Church, a call to which, after a\nperiod of reflection, Marcel assented. It is noteworthy that his\nconversion did not significantly change his philosophy, although it\ndid lead to an increased focus on how various experiences, especially\nmoral experiences, may point to the presence of the transcendent in\nhuman life. \nMarcel, as one would expect, does not engage in philosophy of religion\nin the traditional sense. He is often critical of various attempts to\n“prove” the existence of God in the history of philosophy,\nsuch as those to be found in Thomism. He regards such attempts as\nbelonging to the realm of primary reflection, and as such, they leave\nout the personal experience of God, which is necessarily lost in the\nmove to abstraction. Marcel notes that committed religious believers\nare not greatly interested in arguments for God’s existence, and\nmay even look upon these arguments with suspicion; atheists are also\nusually not persuaded by such arguments (Marcel, 1951b, p. 196;\nMarcel, 1964, p. 179). Another reason for the lack of efficacy of\nformal arguments is that many in the contemporary world are not open\nto the religious worldview. Marcel introduces a distinction between\n“anti-theists” and “atheists” to make this\npoint. Whereas an atheist is somebody who does not believe in God, an\nanti-theist is somebody who does not want to believe in God. It is\npossible, Marcel observes, to close oneself off from the experience of\nthe religious in human life, not for rational reasons, but for reasons\nof self-interest, or from a desire to avoid religious morality, or to\navoid submission to an outside authority. This view is prevalent, he\nbelieves, not just in modern life, but also in modern philosophy:\n“The history of modern philosophy seems to supply abundant\nillustration of the progressive replacement of atheism by…an\nanti-theism, whose mainspring is to will that God should\nnot be” (Marcel 1951b, p. 176). The prevalence of this\nattitude makes it even more difficult to pursue a purely rational\napproach to God’s existence. \nHowever, Marcel develops another approach to the question of God, and\nmany themes in his work are concerned in one way or another with this\ntopic. He belongs to the line of thinkers, which includes Soren\nKierkegaard and Martin Buber in philosophy, and Karl Barth and Paul\nTillich in theology, who draw attention to the non-theoretical\ndimension of religious belief, and moral experience. His approach is\nphenomenological in character, involving a description of various\nhuman experiences and the attempt to reveal their underlying meaning\nand justification. Marcel’s position is that there is a set of\nprofound human experiences (some of which we have described earlier)\nthat reveal the presence of God (the ‘Absolute Thou’) in\nhuman life. These experiences are present in the lives of most human\nbeings, even though a particular individual might not necessarily\nconnect them with a religious worldview, or come to an affirmation of\nGod based on them. The experiences mentioned above of fidelity, hope,\npresence and intersubjectivity, which all involve profound commitments\nthat cannot be captured and analyzed in objective terms, but that are\nnonetheless real and can at least be partly described conceptually (in\nphilosophy, but especially in literature, drama and art [Marcel,\n1963]), are best explained if they are understood as being pledged to\nan absolute, transcendent reality. As noted, the experience of\nfidelity is one of his favorite examples. Fidelity involves a certain\nway of being with another person. The other person is not seen as a\nperson with a certain set of desirable characteristics, or as\nidentified with a function, or even as a rational, autonomous subject;\nrather he or she is experienced as a “thou,” a person with\nwhom I identify and am one with on the path of life (Anderson, 1982,\np. 31). Fidelity is an experience that the other will not fail me, and\nthat I will not fail them, and so, as we have seen, it is deeper than\nconstancy (in many relationships, fidelity is reduced to constancy).\nMarcel suggests that such experiences have religious significance,\nbecause the individual often appeals to an ultimate strength which\nfrom within enables him to make the pledge which he knows he could not\nmake from himself alone (Pax, 1972, p. 60). \nMarcel holds that unconditional commitments such as these are best\nexplained if understood as being pledged to an absolute transcendence.\nIndeed, given that life is full of temptations and challenges, the\nrecognition of an absolute Thou also helps the individual to\nkeep his or her commitments. Of hope he observes: “The\nonly possible source from which this absolute hope springs must once\nmore be stressed. It appears as a response of the creature to the\ninfinite Being to whom it is conscious of owing everything that it has\nand upon whom it cannot impose any condition whatsoever”\n(Marcel, 1962a, p. 47). “Unconditionality,” as he has also\nnoted, “is the true sign of God’s presence” (Marcel,\n1950-51, p. 40). In general, his position is that the affirmation of\nGod can only be attained by an individual at the level of a\nbeing-in-a-situation, or secondary reflection. At the level of primary\nreflection, the existence of God cannot be demonstrated, because the\nindividual must be personally involved in the various experiences that\ncan lead to an affirmation, but such genuine involvement is precluded\nat the level of abstraction. Yet, this does not mean that philosophy\nof religion in the traditional sense is not important; indeed\nMarcel’s reflections just mentioned must be regarded as part of\nan attempt to show, however indirectly, that belief in God is\nreasonable, but, as with all areas of primary reflection, we should\nrecognize the limitations of a purely rational approach to religious\nbelief. \nFour decades after his death, Marcel’s philosophy continues to\ngenerate a steady stream of creative scholarship that, if modest in\nvolume, nevertheless attests to his continued relevance for the\ncontemporary philosophical landscape. Marcel’s influence on\ncontemporary philosophy is apparent, for example, in the work of Paul\nRicoeur, his most famous student. Through Ricoeur, Marcel has\ninfluenced contemporary philosophy in and around the hermeneutic\ntradition. The pattern of “detour and return” that\ncharacterizes Ricoeur and some of his students closely resembles\nMarcel’s dialectic of primary and secondary\n reflection.[13]\n Likewise, Marcel’s understanding of otherness—illustrated\nby his image of “constellations,” conglomerations of\nmeaningfully connected but non-totalizable beings—is an explicit\nchallenge to philosophers of absolute otherness including Emmanuel\nLevinas, Jacques Derrida, and John D. Caputo, and a valuable resource\nfor philosophers with a chiastic understanding of otherness, including\nRicoeur and Richard Kearney. In addition, Marcel’s philosophy\noffers rich possibilities for dialogue with contemporary ontologies\nstruggling to address the problem of “being” without\nsuccumbing to ethical “violence” or\n“ontotheological” conceptions of God. As such, his\nphilosophy should be of interest to scholars interested in the work of\nMartin Heidegger, Jean-Luc Marion, Merold Westphal and others\nphilosophizing at the intersection of philosophy and theology.\nFinally, his insistence that philosophy should illuminate our lived\nexperience and his insistence on concrete examples have much in common\nwith thinkers who view philosophy as a “way of life,”\nincluding Pierre Hadot and Michel Foucault. The resources of\nMarcel’s philosophy have only begun to be tapped, and one may\nhope that the recent republication of what are arguably Marcel’s\ntwo most important works, The Mystery of Being (by St.\nAugustine’s Press) and Creative Fidelity (by Fordham\nUniversity Press), will help to fuel a renaissance in scholarship\nconcerning this remarkable thinker. \nMarcel’s thought continues to endure and a steady stream of\nstudies regularly appear in different disciplines that draw attention\nto the relevance of Marcel’s central ideas for our concerns in\ntwentieth first century philosophy, theology and culture. These works\ninclude Sweetman (2008), an analysis of Marcel’s view of the\nperson and its implications for issues in epistemology and philosophy\nof religion; and Hernandez (2011), a detailed study of Marcel’s\nreligious philosophy from the point of view of his reflections on\nethics. Traenor’s work (2007) places Marcel into dialogue (and\ndebate) with Levinas on the question of the other, while at the same\ntime arguing that their views on the other are incompatible; Tunstall\n(2013) discusses and develops Marcel’s ideas about\ndehumanization with regard to the topic of racism; Tattum (2013)\nplaces Marcel in dialogue with thinkers such as Bergson, Levinas,\nRicoeur and Derrida on the concept of time, while Pierre Colin (2009)\nreturns to Marcel’s views of the experience of hope. \nMarcel remains one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth\ncentury, and his major themes continue to be relevant for the plight\nof humanity in the twentieth first century. Many find Marcel’s\nthought attractive because he emphasizes a number of significant ideas\nthat have been influential in twentieth century thinking in both\nphilosophy and theology: the attempt to preserve the dignity and\nintegrity of the human person by emphasizing the inadequacy of the\nmaterialistic life and the unavoidable human need for transcendence;\nthe inability of philosophy to capture the profundity and depth of key\nhuman experiences, and so the need to find a deeper kind of\nreflection; the emphasis on the human experience of intersubjectivity,\nwhich Marcel believes is at the root of human fulfillment; and a\nseeking after the transcendent dimension of human experience, a\ndimension that he believes cannot be denied without loss, and that\noften gives meaning to many of our most profound experiences. Marcel\nis also regarded as important by a range of thinkers in different\ndisciplines because he presents an alternative vision to challenge the\nmoral relativism and spiritual nihilism of his French rival, Jean Paul\nSartre, and other representative existentialist philosophers (Marcel,\n1995, pp. 47-90). For this important reason, his work continues to\nspeak to many of our concerns today in ethics, politics, and\nreligion.","contact.mail":"brendan.sweetman@rockhurst.edu","contact.domain":"rockhurst.edu"}]
