The logic has been inspired by developments in\nmeta-mathematics such as Gödel’s incompleteness theorems of 1931\nand Löb’s theorem of 1953. As a modal logic, provability logic\nhas been studied since the early seventies, and has had important\napplications in the foundations of mathematics.\n\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, provability logic is interesting\nbecause the concept of provability in a fixed theory of arithmetic has\na unique and non-problematic meaning, other than concepts like\nnecessity and knowledge studied in modal and epistemic logic.\nFurthermore, provability logic provides tools to study the notion of\nself-reference.\n\nTwo strands of research have led to the birth of provability logic.\nThe first one stems from a paper by\n K. Gödel\n (1933), where he introduces translations from intuitionistic\npropositional logic into modal logic (more precisely, into the system\nnowadays called S4), and briefly mentions that provability can be\nviewed as a modal operator. Even earlier, C.I. Lewis started the\nmodern study of modal logic by introducing strict implication as a\nkind of deducibility, where he may have meant deducibility in a formal\nsystem like\n Principia Mathematica,\n but this is not clear from his writings. \nThe other strand starts from research in meta-mathematics: what can\nmathematical theories say about themselves by encoding interesting\nproperties? In 1952, L. Henkin posed a deceptively simple question\ninspired by\n Gödel’s incompleteness theorems.\n In order to formulate Henkin’s question, some more background is\nneeded. As a reminder, Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem\nstates that, for a sufficiently strong formal theory like Peano\nArithmetic, any sentence asserting its own unprovability is in fact\nunprovable. On the other hand, from “outside” the formal\ntheory, one can see that such a sentence is true in the standard\nmodel, pointing to an important distinction between truth and\nprovability. \nMore formally, let \\(\\ulcorner A \\urcorner\\) denote the Gödel\nnumber of arithmetical formula \\(A\\), which is the result of assigning\na numerical code to \\(A\\). Let \\(\\Prov\\) be the formalized provability\npredicate for Peano Arithmetic, which is of the form \\(\\exists p \\,\n\\Proof(p,x)\\). Here, \\(\\Proof\\) is the formalized proof predicate of\nPeano Arithmetic, and \\(\\Proof(p,x)\\) stands for “Gödel\nnumber \\(p\\) codes a correct proof from the axioms of Peano Arithmetic\nof the formula with Gödel number \\(x\\)”. (For a more\nprecise formulation, see Smoryński (1985), Davis (1958).) Now,\nsuppose that Peano Arithmetic proves \\(A \\leftrightarrow \\neg\\)\n\\(\\Prov (\\ulcorner A \\urcorner)\\), then by Gödel’s result,\n\\(A\\) is not provable in Peano Arithmetic, and thus it is true, for in\nfact the self-referential sentence \\(A\\) states “I am not\nprovable”. \nHenkin on the other hand wanted to know whether anything could be said\nabout sentences asserting their own provability: supposing that Peano\nArithmetic proves \\(B \\leftrightarrow \\Prov(\\ulcorner B \\urcorner)\\),\nwhat does this imply about \\(B\\)? Three years later, M. Löb took\nup the challenge and answered Henkin’s question in a surprising way.\nEven though all sentences provable in Peano Arithmetic are indeed true\nabout the natural numbers, Löb showed that the formalized version\nof this fact, \\(\\Prov(\\ulcorner B \\urcorner) \\rightarrow B\\), can be\nproved in Peano Arithmetic only in the trivial case that Peano\nArithmetic already proves \\(B\\) itself. This result, now called\nLöb’s theorem, immediately answers Henkin’s question. (For a\nproof of Löb’s theorem, see\n Section 4.)\n Löb also showed a formalized version of his theorem, namely that\nPeano Arithmetic proves \nIn the same paper, Löb formulated three conditions on the\nprovability predicate of Peano Arithmetic, that form a useful\nmodification of the complicated conditions that Hilbert and Bernays\nintroduced in 1939 for their proof of Gödel’s second\nincompleteness theorem. In the following, derivability of \\(A\\) from\nPeano Arithmetic is denoted by \\(\\PA \\vdash A\\): \nThese Löb conditions, as they are called nowadays, seem to cry\nout for a modal logical investigation, where the modality \\(\\Box\\)\nstands for provability in PA. Ironically, the first time that the\nformalized version of Löb’s theorem was stated as the modal\nprinciple \nwas in a paper by Smiley in 1963 about the logical basis of ethics,\nwhich did not consider arithmetic at all. More relevant\ninvestigations, however, seriously started only almost twenty years\nafter publication of Löb’s paper. The early 1970s saw the rapid\ndevelopment of propositional provability logic, where several\nresearchers in different countries independently proved the most\nimportant results, discussed in Sections\n 2,\n 3, and\n 4.\n Propositional provability logic turned out to capture exactly what\nmany formal theories of arithmetic can say by propositional means\nabout their own provability predicate. More recently, researchers have\ninvestigated the boundaries of this approach and have proposed several\ninteresting more expressive extensions of provability logic (see\n Section 5). \nThe logical language of propositional provability logic contains, in\naddition to propositional atoms and the usual truth-functional\noperators as well as the contradiction symbol \\(\\bot\\), a modal\noperator \\(\\Box\\) with intended meaning “is provable in\n\\(T\\),” where \\(T\\) is a sufficiently strong formal theory, let\nus say Peano Arithmetic (see\n Section 4).\n \\(\\Diamond A\\) is an abbreviation for \\(\\neg\\,\\Box\\neg\\, A\\). Thus, the\nlanguage is the same as that of modal systems such as K and S4\npresented in the entry\n modal logic. \nPropositional provability logic is often called GL, after Gödel\nand Löb. (Alternative names found in the literature for\nequivalent systems are L, G, KW, K4W, and PrL). The logic GL results from\nadding the following axiom to the basic modal logic K: \nAs a reminder, because GL extends K, it contains all formulas having\nthe form of a propositional tautology. For the same reason, GL\ncontains the \nFurthermore, it is closed under the Modus Ponens Rule, which allows to\nderive \\(B\\) from \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) and \\(A\\), and the\nGeneralization Rule, which says that if \\(A\\) is a theorem of GL, then\nso is \\(\\Box A\\). \nThe notion \\(\\GL \\vdash A\\) denotes provability of a modal formula\n\\(A\\) in propositional provability logic. It is not difficult to see\nthat the modal axiom \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box\\Box A\\) (known as Axiom\n4 of modal logic) is indeed provable in GL. To prove this, one uses\nthe substitution \\(A \\wedge \\Box A\\) for \\(A\\) in the axiom (GL).\nThen, seeing that the antecedent of the resulting implication follows\nfrom \\(\\Box A\\), one applies the Distribution Axiom and the\nGeneralization Rule as well as some propositional logic. Unless\nexplicitly stated otherwise, in the sequel “provability\nlogic” stands for the system GL of propositional provability\nlogic. \nAs to the proof theory of provability logic, Valentini (1983)\nproved that a standard sequent calculus formulation of GL obeys\ncut elimination, which means, roughly formulated, that each\nformula provable from GL in the sequent calculus also has a GL sequent\nproof “without detours” (see the entry\n the development of proof theory\nfor a precise explanation of cut elimination). In recent years, there\nhas been renewed interest in the proof theory of GL, see for example\nGoré and Ramanayake (2008). Cut-elimination leads to the\ndesirable subformula property for GL, because all formulas\nthat appear in a cut-free proof are subformulas of the endsequent\nformulas.  \n\nFor recent proof-theoretic investigations of provability logic based\non different cut-free sequent calculi see (Negri 2005, 2014; Poggiolesi 2009). Negri\npresents two equivalent labelled sequent calculi for GL and a\nsyntactic proof of cut elimination. Even if a full subformula property\ndoes not hold for these calculi because of the labelling, the usual\nconsequences of the subformula property can be established: The\nlabelled formalism allows a direct completeness proof, which can be\nused to establish decidability as well as the finite model property,\nwhich means that any formula that is not provable has\na finite counter-model.  \nAn intriguing new proof-theoretical development is Shamkanov’s\nexpansion of sequent-style proof systems by allowing circular\nproofs (Shamkanov 2014). Consider a sequent system for K4, the\nmodal system resulting from GL by replacing the axiom GL by the weaker\naxiom \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box\\Box A\\) (axiom 4). However, suppose\nthat open hypotheses are allowed, provided that the same sequent\noccurs strictly below that hypothesis in the proof tree. Formulated\nmore technically, one can find a circular derivation from an ordinary\nderivation tree by linking each of its non-axiomatic leaves with an\nidentical interior node. Shamkanov (2014) proved that the resulting\nsystem is consistent and that moreover, in general, each sequent has a\nGL-derivation if and only if it has a circular K4-derivation. Circular\nproofs also provide a method to show proof-theoretically that Lyndon’s\ninterpolation theorem holds for GL. Standard interpolation for GL \nhad already been proved before by different methods (Boolos 1979; \nSmoryński 1978; Rautenberg 1983).  (For more information\nabout Lyndon’s interpolation theorem for first-order logic, see also the entry\n first-order model theory ). \nThe main “modal” result about provability logic is the\nfixed point theorem, which D. de Jongh and G. Sambin independently\nproved in 1975 (Sambin 1976). Even though it is formulated and proved by strictly\nmodal methods, the fixed point theorem still has great arithmetical\nsignificance. It says essentially that self-reference is not really\nnecessary, in the following sense. Suppose that all occurrences of the\npropositional variable \\(p\\) in a given formula \\(A(p)\\) are under the\nscope of the provability operator, for example \\(A(p) = \\neg\\Box p\\),\nor \\(A(p) = \\Box(p \\rightarrow q)\\). Then there is a formula \\(B\\) in\nwhich \\(p\\) does not appear, such that all propositional variables\nthat occur in \\(B\\) already appear in \\(A(p)\\), and such that \nThis formula \\(B\\) is called a fixed point of \\(A(p)\\).\nMoreover, the fixed point is unique, or more accurately, if there is\nanother formula \\(C\\) such that \\( \\GL \\vdash C \\leftrightarrow\nA(C)\\), then we must have \\( \\GL \\vdash B \\leftrightarrow C\\). Most\nproofs in the literature give an algorithm by which one can compute\nthe fixed point (see Smoryński 1985, Boolos 1993, Sambin and\nValentini 1982, Lindström 2006). A particularly short and clear proof, as well as a\nvery efficient algorithm to compute fixed points, can be found in\nReidhaar-Olson (1990).  \nFor example, suppose that \\(A(p) = \\neg \\, \\Box p\\). Then the fixed point\nproduced by such an algorithm is \\(\\neg \\, \\Box\\bot\\), and indeed one can\nprove that \nIf this is read arithmetically, the direction from left to right is\njust the formalized version of Gödel’s second incompleteness\ntheorem: if a sufficiently strong formal theory \\(T\\) like Peano\nArithmetic does not prove a contradiction, then it is not provable in\n\\(T\\) that \\(T\\) does not prove a contradiction. Thus, sufficiently\nstrong consistent arithmetical theories cannot prove their own\nconsistency. We will turn to study the relation between provability\nlogic and arithmetic more precisely in\n Section 4,\n but to that end another “modal” aspect of GL needs to be\nprovided first: semantics. \nProvability logic has suitable possible worlds semantics, just like\nmany other modal logics. As a reminder, a possible worlds model (or\nKripke model) is a triple \\(M = \\langle W,R,V \\rangle\\), where \\(W\\)\nis a non-empty set of possible worlds, \\(R\\) is a binary accessibility\nrelation on \\(W\\), and \\(V\\) is a valuation that assigns a truth value\nto each propositional variable for each world in \\(W\\). The pair \\(F =\n\\langle W,R \\rangle\\) is called the frame of this model. The notion of\ntruth of a formula \\(A\\) in a model \\(M\\) at a world \\(W\\), notation\n\\(M,w \\models A\\), is defined inductively. Let us repeat only the most\ninteresting clause, the one for the provability operator \\(\\Box\\): \nSee the entry\n modal logic\n for more information about possible worlds semantics in general. \nThe modal logic K is valid in all Kripke models. Its extension GL\nhowever, is not: we need to restrict the class of possible worlds\nmodels to a more suitable one. Let us say that a formula \\(A\\) is\nvalid in frame \\(F\\), notation \\(F \\models A\\), iff \\(A\\) is true in\nall worlds in Kripke models \\(M\\) based on \\(F\\). It turns out that\nthe new axiom (GL) of provability logic corresponds to a condition on\nframes, as follows: \nFor all frames \\(F = \\langle W,R \\rangle, F \\models \\Box(\\Box p\n\\rightarrow p) \\rightarrow \\Box p\\) iff \\(R\\) is transitive and\nconversely well-founded.  \nHere, transitivity is the well-known property that for all\nworlds \\(w_1\\), \\(w_2\\), \\(w_3\\) in \\(W\\), if \\(w_1 Rw_2\\) and \\(w_2\nRw_3\\), then \\(w_1 Rw_3\\). A relation is conversely\nwell-founded iff there are no infinite ascending sequences, that\nis sequences of the form \\(w_1 Rw_2 Rw_3 R \\ldots\\). Note that\nconversely well-founded frames are also irreflexive, for if \\(wRw\\),\nthis gives rise to an infinite ascending sequence\n\\(wRwRwR\\ldots\\). \nThe above correspondence result immediately shows that GL is modally\nsound with respect to the class of possible worlds models on\ntransitive conversely well-founded frames, because all axioms and\nrules of GL are valid on such models. The question is whether\ncompleteness also holds: for example, the formula \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow\n\\Box\\Box A\\), which is valid on all transitive frames, is indeed\nprovable in GL, as was mentioned in\n Section 1.\n But is every formula that is valid on all transitive\nconversely well-founded frames also provable in GL? \nUnaware of the arithmetical significance of GL, K. Segerberg proved in\n1971 that GL is indeed complete with respect to transitive conversely\nwell-founded frames; D. de Jongh and S. Kripke independently proved\nthis result as well. Segerberg showed that GL is complete even with\nrespect to the more restricted class of finite transitive irreflexive\ntrees, a fact which later turned out to be very useful for Solovay’s\nproof of the arithmetical completeness theorem (see\n Section 4). \nThe modal soundness and completeness theorems immediately give rise to\na decision procedure to check for any modal formula \\(A\\) whether\n\\(A\\) follows from GL or not, by depth-first search through\nirreflexive transitive trees of bounded depth. Looking at the\nprocedure a bit more precisely, it can be shown that GL is decidable\nin the computational complexity class PSPACE, like the well-known\nmodal logics K, T and S4. This means that there is a Turing machine\nthat, given a formula \\(A\\) as input, answers whether \\(A\\) follows\nfrom GL or not; the size of the memory that the Turing machine needs\nfor its computation is only polynomial in the length of \\(A\\). One can\nshow that the decision problem for GL (again, like the decision\nproblems for K, T and S4) is PSPACE-complete, in the sense\nthat all other problems in PSPACE are no harder than deciding whether\na given formula is a theorem of GL. (See Goré and Kelly (2007)\nfor the description of an automated theorem prover for GL.) \nTo give some more perspective on complexity, the class P of functions\ncomputable in an amount of time polynomial in the length of the input,\nis included in PSPACE, which in turn is included in the class EXPTIME\nof functions computable in exponential time (see the entry\n computability and complexity).\n It remains a famous open problem whether these two inclusions are\nstrict, although many complexity theorists believe that they are. Some\nother well-known modal logics, like epistemic logic with common\nknowledge, are decidable in EXPTIME, thus they may be more complex\nthan GL, depending on the open problems. \nMany well-known modal logics \\(S\\) are not only complete with respect\nto an appropriate class of frames, but even strongly\ncomplete. In order to explain strong completeness, we need the\nnotion of derivability from a set of assumptions. A formula\n\\(A\\) is derivable from the set of assumptions \\(\\Gamma\\) in a modal\nlogic \\(S\\), written as \\(\\Gamma \\vdash A\\), if \\(A\\) is in \\(\\Gamma\\)\nor \\(A\\) follows from formulas in \\(\\Gamma\\) and axioms of \\(S\\) by\napplications of Modus Ponens and the Generalization Rule. Here, the\nGeneralization Rule can only be applied to derivations without\nassumptions (see Hakli and Negri 2010). \nNow a modal logic \\(S\\) is strongly complete if for all\n(finite or infinite) sets \\(\\Gamma\\) and all formulas \\(A\\): \nIf, on appropriate \\(S\\)-frames, \\(A\\) is true in all worlds in which\nall formulas of \\(\\Gamma\\) are true, then \\(\\Gamma \\vdash A\\) in the\nlogic \\(S\\).  \nThis condition holds for systems like K, M, K4, S4, and S5. If\nrestricted to finite sets \\(\\Gamma\\), the above condition corresponds\nto completeness. \nStrong completeness does not hold for provability logic, however,\nbecause semantic compactness fails. Semantic compactness is\nthe property that for each infinite set \\(\\Gamma\\) of formulas, \nIf every finite subset \\(\\Delta\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\) has a model on an\nappropriate \\(S\\)-frame, then \\(\\Gamma\\) also has a model on an\nappropriate \\(S\\)-frame.  \nAs a counterexample, take the infinite set of formulas \nThen for every finite subset \\(\\Delta\\) of \\(\\Gamma\\), one can\nconstruct a model on a transitive, conversely well-founded frame and a\nworld in the model where all formulas of \\(\\Delta\\) are true. So by\nmodal soundness, GL does not prove \\(\\bot\\) from \\(\\Delta\\) for any\nfinite \\(\\Delta \\subseteq \\Gamma\\), and a fortiori GL does\nnot prove \\(\\bot\\) from \\(\\Gamma\\), as any GL-proof is finite. On the\nother hand, it is easy to see that there is no model on a transitive,\nconversely well-founded frame where in any world, all formulas of\n\\(\\Gamma\\) hold. Thus \\(\\bot\\) follows semantically from \\(\\Gamma\\),\nbut is not provable from it in GL, contradicting the condition of\nstrong completeness. \nAs an alternative to possible worlds semantics, many modal logics may\nbe given topological semantics. Clearly, propositions can be\ninterpreted as subsets of a topological space. It is also easy to see\nthat the propositional connective \\(\\wedge\\) corresponds to the\nset-theoretic operation \\(\\cap\\), while \\(\\vee\\) corresponds to\n\\(\\cup\\), \\(\\neg\\) corresponds to the set-theoretic complement, and\n\\(\\rightarrow\\) corresponds to \\(\\subseteq\\). Modal logics that\ncontain the reflection axiom \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow A\\) enjoy a\nparticularly natural interpretation of the modal operators as well.\nFor these logics, \\(\\Diamond\\) corresponds to the closure operator in\na topological space, while \\(\\Box\\) corresponds to the interior. To\nsee why these interpretations are appropriate, notice that the\nreflection axiom corresponds to the fact that each set is included in\nits closure and each set includes its interior. \nHowever, provability logic does not prove reflection, as the\ninstantiation \\(\\Box\\bot \\rightarrow \\bot\\) of reflection would lead\nto a contradiction with the axiom (GL). \nProvability logic therefore needs a different approach. Based on a\nsuggestion by J. McKinsey and A. Tarski (1944), L. Esakia (1981, 2003)\ninvestigated the interpretation of \\(\\Diamond\\) as the derived set\noperator \\(d\\), which maps a set \\(B\\) to the set of its limit points\n\\(d(B)\\). To explain the consequences of this interpretation of\n\\(\\Diamond\\), we need two more definitions, namely of the concepts\ndense-in-itself and scattered. A subset \\(B\\) of a\ntopological space is called dense-in-itself if \\(B \\subseteq\nd(B)\\). A topological space is called scattered if it has no\nnon-empty subset that is dense-in-itself. The ordinals in their\ninterval topology form examples of scattered spaces. Esakia (1981)\nproved an important correspondence: he showed that a topological space\nsatisfies the axiom GL if and only if the space is\nscattered. This correspondence soon led to the result,\nindependently found by Abashidze (1985) and Blass (1990), that\nprovability logic is complete with respect to any ordinal \\(\\ge\n\\omega^\\omega\\). \nIn recent years, topological semantics for provability logic has seen\na veritable revival, especially in the study of Japaridze’s bimodal\nprovability logic GLB, an extension of GL (Japaridze 1986). The logic\nGLB turns out to be modally incomplete with respect to its\npossible worlds semantics, in the sense that it does not correspond to\nany class of frames. This feature places bimodal GLB in sharp contrast\nwith unimodal GL, which corresponds to the class of finite transitive\nirreflexive trees, as mentioned above. Beklemishev et al. (2009)\nshowed that GLB is, however, complete with respect to its\ntopological semantics (see also Beklemishev 2009, Icard\n2011). Intriguing reverberations of Esakia’s correspondence between GL\nand scattered topological spaces can even be found in recent\ntopological studies of spatial and epistemic logics (see Aiello et al.\n2007). (See\n Section 5.4\n for further discussion about GLB). \nFrom the time GL was formulated, researchers wondered whether it was\nadequate for formal theories like Peano Arithmetic (PA): does GL prove\neverything about the notion of provability that can be\nexpressed in a propositional modal language and can be proved in Peano\nArithmetic, or should more principles be added to GL? To make this\nnotion of adequacy more precise, we define a realization\n(sometimes called translation or interpretation) to be a function\nf that assigns to each propositional atom of modal logic a\nsentence of arithmetic, where \nIt was already clear in the early 1970s that GL is arithmetically\nsound with respect to PA, formally:  \nTo give some taste of meta-mathematics, let us sketch the soundness\nproof. \nProof sketch of arithmetical soundness. PA indeed\nproves realizations of propositional tautologies, and provability of\nthe Distribution Axiom of GL translates to \nfor all formulas A and B, which is just Löb’s\nsecond derivability condition (see\n Section 1).\n Moreover, PA obeys Modus Ponens, as well as the translation of the\nGeneralization Rule: \nwhich is just Löb’s first derivability condition. Finally, the\ntranslation of the main axiom (GL) is indeed provable in PA: \nThis is exactly the formalized version of Löb’s theorem mentioned\nin\n Section 1. \nLet us give a sketch of the proof of Löb’s theorem itself from\nhis derivability conditions (the proof of the formalized version is\nsimilar). The proof is based on Gödel’s diagonalization lemma,\nwhich says that for any arithmetical formula \\(C(x)\\) there is an\narithmetical formula \\(B\\) such that \nIn words, the formula \\(B\\) says “I have property\n\\(C\\).” \nProof of Löb’s theorem:. Suppose that \\(\\PA\n\\vdash \\Prov(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner ) \\rightarrow A\\); we need to show\nthat \\(\\PA \\vdash A\\). By the diagonalization lemma, there is a\nformula \\(B\\) such that \nFrom this it follows by Löb’s first and second derivability\nconditions plus some propositional reasoning that \nThus, again by Löb’s second condition, \nOn the other hand Löb’s third condition gives \nthus \nTogether with the assumption that \\(PA \\vdash \\Prov(\\ulcorner\nA\\urcorner ) \\rightarrow A\\), this gives \nFinally, the equation produced by the diagonalization lemma implies\nthat \\(\\PA \\vdash B\\), so \\(\\PA \\vdash \\Prov(\\ulcorner B\\urcorner )\\),\nthus \nas desired. \nNote that substituting \\(\\bot\\) for \\(A\\) in Löb’s theorem, we\nderive that \\(\\PA \\vdash \\neg\\, \\Prov(\\ulcorner \\bot\\urcorner )\\) implies\n\\(\\PA \\vdash \\bot\\), which is just the contraposition of Gödel’s\nsecond incompleteness theorem. \nThe landmark result in provability logic is R. Solovay’s arithmetical\ncompleteness theorem of 1976, showing that GL is indeed adequate for\nPeano Arithmetic: \nThis theorem says essentially that the modal logic GL captures\neverything that Peano Arithmetic can truthfully say in modal terms\nabout its own provability predicate. The direction from left to right,\narithmetical soundness of GL, is discussed above. Solovay set out to\nprove the other, much more difficult, direction by contraposition. His\nproof is based on intricate self-referential techniques, and only a\nsmall glimpse can be given here. \nThe modal completeness theorem by Segerberg was an important first\nstep in Solovay’s proof of arithmetical completeness of GL with\nrespect to Peano Arithmetic. Suppose that GL does not prove the modal\nformula \\(A\\). Then, by modal completeness, there is a finite\ntransitive irreflexive tree such that \\(A\\) is false at the root of\nthat tree. Now Solovay devised an ingenious way to simulate such a\nfinite tree in the language of Peano Arithmetic. Thus he found a\nrealization \\(f\\) from modal formulas to sentences of arithmetic, such\nthat Peano Arithmetic does not prove \\(f(A)\\). \nSolovay’s completeness theorem provides an alternative way to\nconstruct many arithmetical sentences that are not provable in Peano\nArithmetic. For example, it is easy to make a possible worlds model to\nshow that GL does not prove \\(\\Box p \\vee \\Box\\neg\\, p\\), so by\nSolovay’s theorem, there is an arithmetical sentence \\(f(p)\\) such\nthat Peano Arithmetic does not prove \\(\\Prov(\\ulcorner f(p)\\urcorner )\n\\vee \\Prov(\\ulcorner \\neg\\, f(p)\\urcorner )\\). In particular, this\nimplies that neither \\(f(p)\\) nor \\(\\neg\\, f(p)\\) is provable in Peano\nArithmetic; for suppose on the contrary that \\(\\PA \\vdash f(p)\\), then\nby Löb’s first condition and propositional logic, \\(\\PA \\vdash\n\\Prov(\\ulcorner f(p)\\urcorner ) \\vee \\Prov(\\ulcorner \\neg\\, f(p)\\urcorner\n)\\), leading to a contradiction, and similarly if one supposes that\n\\(\\PA \\vdash \\neg\\, f(p)\\). \nSolovay’s theorem is so significant because it shows that an\ninteresting fragment of an undecidable formal theory like Peano\nArithmetic—namely that which arithmetic can express in\npropositional terms about its own provability predicate—can be\nstudied by means of a decidable modal logic, GL, with a perspicuous\npossible worlds semantics. \nIn this section, some recent trends in research on provability logic\nare discussed. One important strand concerns the limits on the scope\nof GL, where the main question is, for which formal theories, other\nthan Peano Arithmetic, is GL the appropriate propositional provability\nlogic? Next, we discuss some generalizations of propositional\nprovability logic in more expressive modal languages. \nIn recent years, logicians have investigated many other systems of\narithmetic that are weaker than Peano Arithmetic. Often these\nlogicians took their inspiration from computability issues, for\nexample the study of functions computable in polynomial time. They\nhave given a partial answer to the question: “For which theories\nof arithmetic does Solovay’s arithmetical completeness theorem (with\nrespect to the appropriate provability predicate) still hold?”\nTo discuss this question, two concepts are needed.\n\\(\\Delta_0\\)-formulas are arithmetical formulas in which all\nquantifiers are bounded by a term, for example \nwhere \\(\\bs\\) is the successor operator (“\\(+1\\)”). The\narithmetical theory \\(I \\Delta_0\\) (where I stands for\n“induction”), is similar to Peano Arithmetic, except that\nit allows less induction: the induction scheme \nis restricted to \\(\\Delta_0\\)-formulas \\(A\\). \nAs De Jongh and others (1991) pointed out, arithmetical completeness\ncertainly holds for theories \\(T\\) that satisfy the following two\nconditions: \nFor such theories, arithmetical soundness and completeness of GL hold,\nprovided that \\(\\Box\\) translates to \\(\\Prov_T\\), a natural provability\npredicate with respect to a sufficiently simple axiomatization of\n\\(T\\). Thus for modal sentences \\(A\\): \nIt is not clear yet whether Condition 1 gives a lower bound on the\nscope of provability logic. For example, it is still an open question\nwhether GL is the provability logic of \\(I \\Delta_0+\\Omega_1\\), a\ntheory which is somewhat weaker than \\(I \\Delta_0\\)+EXP in that\n\\(\\Omega_1\\) is the axiom asserting that for all \\(x\\), its power\n\\(x^{\\log(x)}\\) exists. Provability logic GL is arithmetically sound\nwith respect to \\(I \\Delta_0+\\Omega_1\\), but except for some partial\nresults by Berarducci and Verbrugge (1993), providing arithmetic\nrealizations consistent with \\(I \\Delta_0+\\Omega_1\\) for a restricted\nclass of sentences consistent with GL, the question remains open. Its\nanswer may hinge on open problems in computational complexity\ntheory. \nThe above result by De Jongh et al. shows a strong feature of\nprovability logic: for many different arithmetical theories, GL\ncaptures exactly what those theories say about their own provability\npredicates. At the same time this is a weakness. For example,\npropositional provability logic does not point to any differences\nbetween those theories that are finitely axiomatizable and those that\nare not. \nIn order to be able to speak in a modal language about important\ndistinctions between theories, researchers have extended provability\nlogic in many different ways. Let us mention a few. One extension is\nto add a binary modality \\(\\interprets\\), where for a given\narithmetical theory \\(T\\), the modal sentence \\(A \\interprets B\\) is\nmeant to stand for “\\(T+B\\) is interpretable in \\(T+A\\)”\n(Švejdar, 1983).\nDe Jongh and Veltman (1990) investigated modal semantics for several\ninterpretability logics, while De Jongh and Visser (1991) proved the\nexplicit fixed-point property for the most important ones. Visser\ncharacterized the interpretability logic of the most common finitely\naxiomatized theories, and Berarducci and Shavrukov independently\ncharacterized the one for PA, which is not finitely axiomatizable. It\nappears that indeed, the interpretability logic of finitely\naxiomatizable theories is different from the interpretability logic of\nPeano Arithmetic (see Montagna 1987; Visser 1990, 1998; Berarducci\n1990, Shavrukov 1988; Joosten and Visser 2000). \nAnother way to extend the framework of propositional provability logic\nis to add propositional quantifiers, so that one can express\nprinciples like Goldfarb’s: \nsaying that for any two sentences there is a third sentence which is\nprovable if and only if either of the first two sentences is provable.\nThis principle is provable in Peano Arithmetic (see e.g. Artemov and\nBeklemishev 1993). The set of sentences of GL with propositional\nquantifiers that is arithmetically valid turns out to be undecidable\n(Shavrukov 1997). \nJaparidze’s (1988) bimodal logic GLB has two \\(\\Box\\)-like\nprovability operators, denoted by \\([0]\\) and \\([1]\\), with their dual\n\\(\\Diamond\\)-like operators \\(\\langle 0\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle\n1\\rangle\\), respectively. In Japaridze’s interpretation, one can\nthink of \\([0]\\) as standing for the standard provability predicate in\nPeano Arithmetic. On the other hand, \\([1]\\) corresponds to a stronger\nprovability predicate, namely \\(\\omega\\)-provabilty.  \nLet us define the concepts that are needed to understand this intended\ninterpretation of GLB. An arithmetical theory \\(T\\) is defined to be\n\\(\\omega\\)-consistent if and only if for all formulas A with\nfree variable \\(x\\), \\(T\\vdash \\neg\\, A(I_n)\\) for all \\(n\\) implies\nthat \\(T \\not\\vdash \\exists x \\, A(x)\\); here, \\(I_n\\) is the numeral of\n\\(n\\), i.e., the term \\(\\bs\\bs\\ldots\\bs 0\\) with \\(n\\) occurrences of\nthe successor operator \\(\\bs\\). Peano Arithmetic (PA) is the most\nwell-known example of an \\(\\omega\\)-consistent theory (see also\n Gödel’s incompleteness theorems).\n Now let PA\\(^+\\) be the arithmetical theory whose axioms are those of\nPA together with all sentences \\(\\forall x \\, \\neg \\, A(x)\\) such that for\nevery \\(n\\), PA\\(\\vdash \\neg \\, A(I_n)\\). Now \\(\\omega\\)-provability is\nsimply provability in PA\\(^+\\), so it is the dual of\n\\(\\omega\\)-consistency. \nJaparidze’s bimodal provability logic GLB can be axiomatized by the\naxioms and rules of GL (see\n Section 2),\n formulated separately for [0] and [1]. In addition, GLB has two mixed\naxioms, namely: \n\n\\[\\tag{Monotonicity}\n[0] A \\rightarrow [1] A\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\Pi^0_1\\)-completeness}\n\\langle 0\\rangle A \\rightarrow [1]\\langle 0\\rangle A\n\\]\n\n Japaridze’s logic is\ndecidable and has a reasonable Kripke semantics, and it is\narithmetically sound and complete with respect to Peano Arithmetic\n(Japaridze 1988, Boolos 1993). \nA polymodal analogue of Japaridze’s GLB, named GLP, has received a lot\nof attention in recent years. GLP has infinitely many \\(\\Box\\)-like\nprovability operators, denoted by boxes \\([n]\\) for every natural\nnumber \\(n\\), with their dual \\(\\Diamond\\)-like operators\n\\(\\langle n\\rangle\\). Again, one can think of \\([0]\\) as standing for the\nstandard provability predicate in Peano Arithmetic, \\(\\langle 1\\rangle\\)\nfor \\(\\omega\\)-provability, etcetera. GLP has been axiomatized by\nstarting from the axioms and rules of GL (see\n Section 2),\n formulated separately for each \\([n]\\). In addition, GLP has three\nmixed axiom schemes, namely, as formulated by Beklemishev (2010):\n\n\\[\n[m] A \\rightarrow [n] A, \\mbox{ for } m \\leq n\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\langle k\\rangle A \\rightarrow [n]\\langle k\\rangle A, \\mbox{ for } k \\lt n\n\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n[m] A \\rightarrow [n][m] A, \\mbox{ for } m \\leq n\n\\]\n\n  \nGLP has recently been endowed with a Kripke semantics with respect to\nwhich it is complete, and has also been shown to be arithmetically\ncomplete with respect to Peano Arithmetic (see Beklemishev 2010a,\n2011a). Just like for GL, the decision problem for GLP is\nPSPACE-complete (Shapirovsky 2008), while its closed fragment is\npolynomial time decidable (Pakhomov 2014). \nIn recent years a number of results have been proved about the\npolymodal logic GLP of strong provability predicates. Here follow some\nparticularly fruitful topics: \nFinally, one can of course study predicate provability logic. The\nlanguage is that of predicate logic without function symbols, together\nwith the operator \\(\\Box\\). Here, the situation becomes much more\ncomplex than in the case of propositional provability logic. To begin\nwith, the straightforward quantified version of GL does not have the\nfixed-point property, is not complete with respect to any class of\nKripke frames, and is not arithmetically complete with respect to\nPeano Arithmetic (Montagna, 1984). The question then arises: Is there\nany nicely axiomatized predicate provability logic that is adequate,\nproving exactly the valid principles of provability? The answer is\nunfortunately a resounding no: Vardanyan (1986) has proved on the\nbasis of ideas by Artemov (1985a) that the set of sentences of\npredicate provability logic all of whose realizations are provable in\nPA is not even recursively enumerable but \\(\\Pi^0_2\\)-complete, so it\nhas no reasonable axiomatization. Visser and De Jonge (2006) showed\nthat there is no escape from Vardanyan’s theorem by proving a\ngeneralization: For a wide range of arithmetical theories \\(T\\), the\nset of sentences of predicate provability logic all of whose\nrealizations are provable in \\(T\\) turns out to be\n\\(\\Pi^0_2\\)-complete as well.  \nLeft out in the above discussion are many other important strands of\nresearch in provability logic and its extensions. The interested\nreader is pointed to the following areas:  \nEven though propositional provability logic is a modal logic with a\nkind of “necessity” operator, it withstands Quine’s (1976)\ncontroversial critique of modal notions as unintelligible, already\nbecause of its clear and unambiguous arithmetic interpretation. For\nexample, unlike for many other modal logics, formulas with nested\nmodalities like \\(\\Box\\Diamond p \\rightarrow \\Box\\bot\\) are not\nproblematic, nor are there any disputes about which ones should be\ntautologies. In fact, provability logic embodies all the desiderata\nthat Quine (1953) set out for syntactic treatments of modality. \nQuine’s main arrows were pointed towards modal predicate logics,\nespecially the construction of sentences that contain modal operators\nunder the scope of quantifiers (“quantifying in”). In\npredicate provability logic, however, where quantifiers range over\nnatural numbers, both de dicto and de re modalities\nhave straightforward interpretations, contrary to the case of other\nmodal logics (see the note on the\n de dicto / de re distinction).\n For example, formulas like \nare not at all problematic. If the number \\(n\\) is assigned to \\(x\\),\nthen \\(\\Box \\,\\exists y\\,(y = x)\\) is true with respect to this assignment\niff the sentence \\(\\exists y\\,(y=I_n)\\) is provable in Peano Arithmetic;\nhere, \\(I_n\\) is the numeral of \\(n\\), i.e., the term\n\\(\\bs\\bs\\ldots\\bs 0\\) with \\(n\\) occurrences of the successor operator\n\\(\\bs\\). This sentence is true for all \\(n\\) in the standard model of\nthe natural numbers, and \\(\\forall x \\,\\Box\\, \\exists y \\,(y = x)\\) is even\nprovable in Peano Arithmetic. \nBy the way, the Barcan Formula \nis not true for the integers, let alone provable (for example, take\nfor \\(A(x)\\) the formula “\\(x\\) does not code a proof of\n\\(\\bot\\)”). Its converse  \non the other hand, is provable in Peano Arithmetic for any formula\n\\(A\\).  \nProvability logic has very different principles from other modal\nlogics, even those with a seemingly similar purpose. For example,\nwhile provability logic captures provability in formal theories of\narithmetic,\n epistemic logic\n endeavors to describe knowledge, which could be viewed as a kind of\ninformal provability. In many versions of epistemic logic, one of the\nmost important principles is the truth axiom (5): \nThe analogous principle clearly does not hold for GL: after all,  \nThus, it seems misguided to compare the strength of both notions or to\ncombine them in one modal system. Perhaps formal provability is indeed\nin some sense a stronger notion than informal provability, but\ndefinitely this is not an arithmetic truth or validity, nor is the\nother direction. Discussions of the consequences of Gödel’s\nincompleteness theorems sometimes involve confusion around the notion\nof provability, giving rise to claims that humans could beat formal\nsystems in “knowing” theorems (see Davis (1990, 1993) for\ngood discussions of such claims). \nAll in all, formal provability is a precisely defined concept, much\nmore so than truth and knowledge. Thus,\n self-reference\n within the scope of provability does not lead to semantic paradoxes\nlike the Liar. Instead, it has led to some of the most important\nresults about mathematics, such as Gödel’s incompleteness\ntheorems.","contact.mail":"L.C.Verbrugge@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"}]
