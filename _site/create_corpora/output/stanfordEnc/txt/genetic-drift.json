Yet, there are\nin fact some interesting aspects to C. nemoralis. This\nspecies of snail is polymorphic; the snail’s shell varies in\ncolor (pink, brown, and yellow) as well as the number of visible bands\n(anywhere from 0–5). But the colors and bands are not equally\ndistributed across populations. In some populations, pink\npredominates, whereas in others, yellow or brown, and similarly, some\nbanding numbers are more prevalent in some populations than in others.\nThus, not only are there variations within populations (it is rare to\nfind a population that is all one color or where all the snails have\nthe same number of bands), but there are variations between\npopulations. What is the explanation for this distribution of forms?\nThose whose knowledge of evolution familiarized them only with the\ntheory of natural selection might assume, for example, that in the\npopulations where yellow snails were the most prevalent, it was\nbecause they were fitter than the other colors—that there was\nsome environmental factor that favored yellow over brown and pink. And\nthat in the populations where brown snails were the most prevalent,\nthere was some difference in the environment that led them to be\nfavored over yellow and pink snails. But is there some other\nexplanation? Perhaps the distributions are in some sense due to\nchance, perhaps even in a way that can be modeled mathematically. What\nwould that mean, and how would you determine which explanation was\ncorrect? The attempt to develop “chancy” explanations that\nare alternatives (perhaps complementary alternatives) to those due to\nnatural selection is what led biologists to develop models of\ngenetic drift.\n\n\nGenetic drift (variously called “random drift”,\n“random genetic drift”, or sometimes just\n“drift”) has been a source of ongoing controversy within\nthe philosophy of biology and evolutionary biology communities, to the\nextent that even the question of what drift is has become\ncontroversial. There seems to be agreement that drift is a chance (or\nprobabilistic or statistical) element within population genetics (see\nentry on\n population genetics)\n and within evolutionary biology more generally, and that the term\n“random” isn’t invoking indeterminism or any\ntechnical mathematical meaning, but that’s about where agreement\nends. Yet genetic drift models are a staple topic in population\ngenetics textbooks and research, with genetic drift described as one\nof the main factors of evolution alongside selection, mutation, and\nmigration. Some claim that genetic drift has played a major role in\nevolution (particularly molecular evolution), while others claim it to\nbe minor. This article will examine these and other controversies.\n\n\nIn order to break through the logjam of competing definitions of\ndrift, this entry begins with a brief history of the concept, before\nexamining various philosophical claims about the proper\ncharacterization of drift and whether it can be distinguished from\nnatural selection; the relation of drift to debates over\nstatisticalism; whether drift can be detected empirically and if so,\nhow; and the proper understanding of drift as a model and as a\n(purported) law.\n\nAlthough Charles Darwin invoked “chance” in various ways\nin the Origin of Species (Beatty 1984), he seems not to have\nincluded a concept of drift in his account. He does note in passing\nthat \n[v]ariations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by\nnatural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating element, as\nperhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately\nbecome fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the nature of\nthe conditions. (Darwin 1872: 63; see similar claims on p. 120 and p.\n176) \nAs the reader will see, this is tantalizingly similar to contemporary\nconceptions of drift. But Darwin does not develop the idea further; in\nparticular, he does not tell us why the distributions of such\nvariations would be fluctuating over time or how it is that they would\nultimately become fixed. The first serious (and mathematical)\ntreatments of drift are usually traced to two of the founders of\npopulation genetics, Sewall Wright and R.A. Fisher, although neither\nclaimed to have developed the ideas behind drift (Beatty 1992). Wright\n(1951) credits John Gulick (1873) with the genesis of the idea whereas\nFisher (1922b) first discussed the idea as derived from the work of\nA.C. and A.L. Hagedoorn (1921), although Wright (1931a) cites the\nHagedoorns too. It is unclear who first uses the term\n“drift” in this context; it appears as early as Wright\n(1929). So, let us briefly examine Gulick and the Hagedoorns in order\nto understand the origins of the term “drift”. \nGulick (1873) points out that with natural selection, one can assume\nthat where different forms are found, different external conditions\nwill also be found (with the different forms having adapted over the\ncourse of generations to the different external conditions). However,\nthere seem to be cases (e.g., among snails) where the external\nconditions are very similar, yet the organismic forms are very\ndifferent. He notes that these species tend to occupy very small\nareas, even though there is reason to believe it is not because they\nlack the ability to migrate further. He then postulates a scenario:\nSuppose some members of a species migrate to a new area where they are\nfree from competition and largely separated from the original\npopulation. New variations will arise in the new population, but\nunless they are “decidedly malformed”, they will persist.\nThe new population will thus come to differentiate itself from the\noriginal population (e.g., with new shades of color or with variations\nof shape), perhaps rapidly if there is a “preexisting tendency\nto rapid variation”. \nSome points to note here that become relevant in later discussions of\ndrift: 1) Drift is described in contrast to natural selection. 2) The\nvariations increasing in the population are those that are neutral, or\nat least not severely deleterious. (Note that 1 and 2 are also present\nin the quote from Darwin above). 3) Drift is associated with small\npopulations (although it is not fully clear why). 4) Drift is\nassociated with the founding of a new population in a new area. 5)\nChanges in the population are the result of movements of organisms and\ntheir tendency to produce new variations, both of which are physical\nprocesses and not purely mathematical constructs (something that\nbecomes an issue in later debates). 6) The changes described are of\norganisms in a population. \nHagedoorn and Hagedoorn (1921) similarly point out that some traits of\norganisms are “trivial”, i.e., “cannot possibly be\naccounted for as useful”, such as “the shape and\narrangement of small hairs on the seeds of some cereals” (p.\n107). They likewise maintain that such traits, which can be stable\n(“pure”, i.e., fixed) within a species, cannot be the\nproduct of natural selection; instead, the Hagedoorns assert, they\nmust be “due to some process which accompanies selection”\n(p. 108). The Hagedoorns then proceed to describe several ways in\nwhich variability in a population can be reduced: a new population is\nfounded which lacks some of the variability of the original\npopulation; a population is split in half (with the variability in the\ndaughter populations differing from each other and from the original);\nand “random sampling” where even though the size of the\npopulation remains relatively constant from year to year, only a small\nfraction successfully reproduce. On this last point, they state, \nThe group of organisms chosen by fate to become the parents of the\nnext generation is usually, but always occasionally, considerably\nsmaller than the number of individuals of their species. (1921:\n120) \nThus, the Hagedoorns endorse points 1–5 above, while describing\ntwo additional processes besides #4 (the founding of a new\npopulation), namely the splitting of a population and the random\nsampling of parents. They further explain the relevance of #3 (small\npopulations): “the smaller the group, the more limited its\npotential variability, the sooner it will be pure altogether”\n(p. 123). And finally, they maintain that drift can produce fixation\n(“purity”), or the complete loss of variation within a\npopulation, even in the absence of selection. Fisher (1922b) reads the\nHagedoorns as claiming that “random survival is a more important\nfactor in limiting the variability of species than preferential\nsurvival” (p. 321), a claim that he challenged by attempting to\nshow that such a process would be too slow to overcome the rate of\nmutation (and thus the introduction of new variability—but he\nseems to say otherwise in 1922a). \nAn essay published by Wright in 1931 provides what is perhaps one of\nthe earliest explicit characterizations of drift: \nIt has seemed to me that another factor should be much more important\nin keeping the system of gene frequencies from settling into\nequilibrium. This is the effect of random sampling in a\nbreeding population of limited size. The gene frequencies of one\ngeneration may be expected to differ a little from those of the\npreceding merely by chance. In the course of generations this\nmay bring about important changes, although the farther the\ndrift from the theoretical equilibrium, the greater will be\nthe pressure toward return. (Wright 1931b: 205; emphasis added) \nThe paper from which this quote is taken was meant to be a summary of\na longer paper, also published in 1931 (Wright 1986: 88). In the\nlonger paper (1931a), Wright specifies that the random sampling is of\ngametes. (Gametes are cells that fuse together during\nfertilization, such as an egg and a sperm). So, even though Wright\n(1931a) notes that the Hagedoorns had “urged the importance of\nsuch random fixation as a factor in evolution”, and states that\nFisher (1922b) had analyzed the issue, has he changed the subject to\nbe random sampling of gametes rather than of\n“parents” (i.e., organisms)? In short, no: Wright (1932\nand elsewhere) makes it clear that he considers drift to encompass\nboth random sampling of gametes and random sampling of organisms. In\nother words, he has expanded the phenomena that the concept\nof drift is meant to cover from that discussed by Gulick, the\nHagedoorns, and Fisher. But Wright’s 1932 paper also emphasized\nwhat would become a persistent confusion between drift and inbreeding;\nboth inbreeding and drift are more significant in small populations,\nso it can become easy to conflate them. But you can have random\nsampling of parents (say, through a population split) without\ninbreeding, and inbreeding without random sampling of parents. That\nalone shows that drift and inbreeding are not the same. So, not all of\nthe expansions of drift were productive ones. \nIt should be noted that while Wright and Fisher had numerous\nback-and-forth discussions and disagreements about each other’s\nclaims concerning the role of drift in evolution (Provine 1986,\nSkipper 2002), they did not seem to disagree about what drift\nwas. Wright (1948) considered the following to be an\n“acceptable statement” of his view from Fisher and E.B.\nFord: \nGreat evolutionary importance has been attached by Sewall Wright\n(1931, 1932, 1935, 1940) to the fact that small shifts in the\ngene-ratios of all segregating factors will occur from generation to\ngeneration owing to the errors of random sampling in the process by\nwhich the gametes available in any one generation are chosen to\nconstitute the next. Such chance deviations will, of course, be\ngreater the smaller the isolated populations concerned. (Fisher and\nFord 1947) \nOn the other hand, Wright’s later incorporation of fluctuations\nin mutation rate, fluctuations in migration, and fluctuations in\nselection (see, e.g., Wright 1949) as types of drift was challenged by\nCain and Currey, who asserted that “the worker on actual\nexamples must classify processes according to their biological\nsignificance” and that such lumping together would produce\nconfusion and prevent proper analysis of actual situations (Cain &\nCurrey 1963: 59). They thus urged the use of the term “sampling\ndrift”, which Wright adopted in the fourth volume of his 1978\nmagnum opus, Evolution and the Genetics of Populations. \nIn short, drift’s founders exhibit a diversity of views about\ndrift, which John Beatty helpfully describes as follows: \ndrift is a heterogeneous category of evolutionary causes and effects,\nwhose overall significance relative to other modes of evolution\n(especially evolution by natural selection) has been greatly disputed.\n(Beatty 1992: 273) \nPotential causes invoked in the discussion above include sampling of\ngametes, sampling of parents, founding of new populations, splitting\nof populations, each of which is intensified when populations are\nsmall, while potential effects mentioned include fluctuations of gene\nfrequencies from one generation to the next, loss of variants from a\npopulation, and fixation of a (possibly non-adapted) type in a\npopulation. Are these causes and effects all drift? With that\nsort of confusing heterogeneity, there is little surprise that the\nconcept has drawn philosophical attention. But at least we have our\nstarting point for philosophical discussion (see Beatty 1992 and\nPlutynski 2007 for additional historical overview). \nPhilosophers have taken a variety of approaches to characterizing\ndrift and distinguishing it from natural selection, including a causal\nprocess approach that derives from the history just presented,\napproaches that are mathematically derived, and other sorts of\napproaches. These are discussed in turn. \nReflecting on the historical uses of the term “drift”,\nBeatty states that \nwhat most of the phenomena so designated [as drift] have in common is\none or another biological form of random or indiscriminate sampling,\nand consequent sampling error. (Beatty 1992: 273; see also Plutynski\net al. 2016 on the modern synthesis authors’ agreement on this\npoint) \nLet’s begin with indiscriminate sampling. Beatty states that\nparent sampling is \nthe process of determining which organisms of one generation will\nbe parents of the next, and how many offspring each parent will\nhave (1984: 188; italics in original) \nBeatty maintains that this parent sampling can be discriminate, that\nis, with regard to physical differences, or indiscriminate, that is,\nwithout regard to physical differences (1984: 189). Discriminate\nparent sampling is generally considered natural selection;\nindiscriminate parent sampling is random drift. Beatty characterizes\ngamete sampling similarly, as \nthe process of determining which of the two genetically different\ntypes of gametes produced by a heterozygotic parent is actually\ncontributed to each of its offspring (1984: 189; italics in\noriginal) \nHe continues: \nThis sort of sampling might be indiscriminate in the sense that any\nphysical difference between the two types of gametes produced by a\nheterozygote might be irrelevant to whether one or the other is\nactually contributed to any particular offspring. (1984: 189) \nAnd again, the indiscriminate form of sampling is drift while\ndiscriminate gamete sampling would be selection. \nSeveral illustrations of indiscriminate sampling are common in the\nliterature, but some are more helpful than others. One is a\nhypothetical scenario in which two genetically and phenotypically\nidentical twins are walking together; one is struck by lightning\nwhereas the other lives to reproduce. (The example seems to have its\norigins in Scriven 1959 and Mills and Beatty 1979, although these\nauthors were making a point about fitness, not about drift). This is\nan unfortunate illustration in part because it is too easy to get\ncaught up in the question of whether the twins are really\ngenetically and physically identical, but, more importantly, it is\nmisleading because in fact, drift requires heritable\nvariation, just as selection does. The lightning example is also\nproblematic because it makes drift seem exceptional and catastrophic,\nwhereas it is generally considered to be pervasive (i.e., occurring in\nall populations) and not necessarily due to catastrophic or unusual\nevents. Others (e.g., Matthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew\n2002) use a series of coin tosses as an illustration of drift, but\nthis could be challenged because it encourages binary thinking,\ninstead of allowing for multiple variants with multiple outcomes, and\nbecause it is unclear what the “population” of coin flips\namounts to. \nA better illustration of drift has its origins in Theodosius\nDobzhansky’s (1937) discussion of Dubinin and Romaschoff’s\n(1932) model, which asks us to imagine an urn filled with different\ncolored balls. If the balls are drawn from the urn without respect to\ncolor, e.g., by a person drawing balls while blindfolded, then the\nballs are being indiscriminately sampled (unlike discriminate\nsampling, where someone deliberately tries to pick balls of a certain\ncolor). If a large sample of balls is taken, we expect the frequencies\nof colored balls in the sample drawn from the urn to be very close to\nthe frequencies in the urn. If only a small sample of colored balls is\ndrawn from the urn, then our sample may very well have different\nproportions of colored balls than the urn does. Multiple samplings\ntaken over time, which would correspond to multiple generations, would\ntend to exhibit a pattern of fluctuating frequencies (recall the quote\nfrom Darwin above). The illustration thus models the population, its\nvariants with their physical differences, and gives a clear\nunderstanding of the possible outcomes. It is also easily\nextrapolatable to, e.g., colorblind predators (Hodge 1987) and other\nindiscriminate sampling agents. It does, however, have some\nlimitations; for example, it lacks an analogue for reproduction, since\nthe balls do not produce offspring, multiple or otherwise. \nAlthough the characterization of drift and selection in terms of\nindiscriminate and discriminate sampling seems straightforward, with\nBeatty’s explication of indiscriminate sampling an important\nclarification of what the Hagedoorns, Fisher, and Wright seem to have\nmeant by “random” sampling, Beatty (1984) raises a problem\nfor the conceptual distinction between natural selection and random\ndrift. The problem is as follows: For every population of organisms in\na given environment, with a certain distribution of types and\nassociated fitnesses, there is a range of possible outcomes of natural\nselection, with some more likely than others. It is, of course, more\nlikely that the fitter organisms will have greater reproductive\nsuccess in the next generation than the less fit, but it is also\npossible that they will not. (Darwin repeatedly emphasized this chance\nelement of natural selection). So, what do we say about the outcomes\nwhere the less fit outreproduce the more fit? Beatty states: \nTo the extent that those outcomes are less representative of\nthe physical abilities of those organisms to survive and reproduce in\nthe environment in question, any evolutionary change that results will\nbe more a matter of random drift, \nconcluding that it is \nconceptually difficult to distinguish natural selection from random\ndrift, especially where improbable results of natural\nselection are concerned (Beatty 1984: 196; emphasis in\noriginal) \nAs will be discussed further below, much of the twentieth century was\nmarked by debates among biologists about the relative importance of\ndrift and selection in evolution. Were those debates at least in part\nthe result of conceptual unclarity? Millstein (2002) argues that we\nneed not accept this inadvertent consequence of Beatty’s\nargument, and that selection can, in fact, be distinguished from\ndrift. In order to do this, three extensions should be made to\nBeatty’s account. First, similar to Hodge (1987), Millstein\nsuggests that a proper distinction between drift and selection relies\non causation, specifically, that drift processes are indiscriminate\nsampling processes in which any heritable physical differences between\nentities (organisms, gametes, etc.) are causally\nirrelevant to differences in reproductive success, whereas\nnatural selection processes are discriminate sampling processes in\nwhich any heritable physical differences between entities (organisms,\ngametes, etc.) are causally relevant to differences in\nreproductive success. These more precise characterizations of\n“indiscriminate sampling” and “discriminate\nsampling” are intended to replace the metaphorical\n“sampling” talk, retaining the term “sampling”\nas a useful shorthand only. Second, we should be careful to\ndistinguish the process of drift from the outcomes\nthat drift produces, and the process of selection from the\noutcomes that selection produces. (Of course, the importance\nof distinguishing process from outcome is not a novel insight; what is\nnovel here is its application to the problem of distinguishing drift\nfrom selection. The distinction has sometimes been rendered as\n“process vs. product” rather than “process vs.\noutcome” in the philosophical literature, but given the\nteleological and other misleading connotations of\n“product”, the term “outcome” is preferable\nand “product” should be avoided). Third, we should\ncharacterize drift and selection as processes rather than outcomes (as\nin the first of the three points). If we do these three things, then\ndrift and selection are conceptually distinct and the problem Beatty\nraises is dissolved; discriminate sampling processes where unlikely\noutcomes obtain are still selection processes. On this view, it is\nfurther acknowledged that it is possible for drift and selection to\nproduce the same outcomes, which helps explain the persistence of\nbiologists’ debates over the relative importance of drift and\nselection without making them seem trivial (see Millstein 2002 for\nadditional discussion of Beatty’s arguments). \nAnd what are these drift processes? They are the same physical\nindiscriminate sampling processes that Gulick, the Hagedoorns, Wright,\nand Fisher (and later, Kimura, who will be discussed further below)\nsought to characterize: the sampling of gametes in the formation of\nzygotes, the sampling of parents, the founding of new populations, and\nthe splitting of populations. (Note that this is not intended to be an\nexhaustive list). The outcomes are likewise those mentioned by\ndrift’s founders: fluctuations of gene frequencies from one\ngeneration to the next, loss of variants from a population, and\nfixation of a type in a population. (Again, this is not an exhaustive\nlist). Each of these outcomes is affected by population size, as any\nindiscriminate sampling process is; smaller populations undergoing\ndrift tend to experience greater fluctuations in gene frequencies, a\nfaster loss of variants from the population, and faster fixation of\ntypes in a population. Thus, the Beatty/Hodge/Millstein account of\ndrift—the Causal Process Account of Drift—is one that is\ngrounded in the historical development of the term and in biological\npractice, with the philosopher’s role being one of clarification\nand elaboration. Christopher Stephens (2004), Robert Northcott (2010),\nand Chris Haufe (2013) also seem to endorse the bare bones view of\ndrift as a sampling process, if not the Causal Process Account of\nDrift in all of its details. \nHowever, the Causal Process Account of Drift has not gone\nunchallenged. Robert Brandon (2005) argues that it “does not map\nwell onto the ways biologists differentiate drift from\nselection” (2005: 156), that selection and drift are the same\nprocess (i.e., sampling), and that the large majority of biological\ncases are not cases of indiscriminate sampling. He maintains that\n“Drift is any deviation from the expected levels of reproduction\ndue to sampling error” whereas “Selection is differential\nreproduction that is due to (and in accord with) expected differences\nin reproductive success” (2005: 168–9). These definitions\ninclude both process and outcome. Millstein (2005) responds\nto each of these challenges and defends her view over his. For the\npurposes of this essay, it is important to note, as Millstein (2005)\nacknowledges, that Brandon is certainly correct in his descriptive\nclaim that many biologists incorporate both process and outcome in\ntheir definitions of drift (see Millstein, Skipper, and Dietrich\n(2009) for examples). Indeed, the plurality of definitions of drift\noffered by contemporary biologists—some process-oriented, some\noutcome-oriented, some both, and some alternating within the same\nwork—gives rise to the need for philosophical analysis, even if\nthe result, in the end, is to accept that pluralism. The Causal\nProcess Account of Drift is making a prescriptive claim on the grounds\nof 1) increased clarity, 2) the ability to conceptually differentiate\nbiologically very different phenomena, such as selection in a\nfluctuating environment from fluctuating gene frequencies due to\nindiscriminate sampling, which have the same outcomes, while 3)\nmaintaining a grounding in biological practice and (some) biological\nusage. \nJessica Pfeifer (2005) weighs in on the disagreement between Millstein\nand Brandon, arguing that it is reasonable to think that the source of\nprobabilities in natural selection are at least partly a result of\nabstracting from or ignoring certain features of the environment and\nthat, if this view is adopted, it is not conceptually confused to\ntreat selection and drift as causally distinct. On Pfeifer’s\nview, drift is caused by the distribution of ignored factors, whereas\nselection for the trait in question is caused by those features that\nare not ignored. \nPeter Gildenhuys (2009) argues that the term “drift” is\nused to refer to causal influences over a population that have three\nfeatures: they are non-interactive, non-pervasive, and indiscriminate\n(NINPICs). Thus, he endorses drift as indiscriminate sampling; the\nother modifications he makes to the view seem to stem from thinking\nthat the Causal Process Account precludes drift and selection from\nco-occurring and from thinking the view needs to account for location\n(e.g., an organism being in the wrong place at the wrong time) as an\nirrelevant causal factor. In any case, he acknowledges that his\naccount and the Causal Process Account probably agree in practice over\nwhat sorts of things should be characterized as constituting drift.\nLarry Shapiro and Elliott Sober (2007) also endorse the view that\nselection and drift are distinct processes, but Sober, at least, has\nbacked off this view in a recent paper co-authored with Hayley\nClatterbuck and Richard Lewontin (Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin\n2013). Like Gildenhuys, they seem to suggest that if selection and\ndrift are distinct processes that they cannot co-occur, and they seem\nto think that the mere introduction of finite population size\nintroduces drift. \nTo be clear, however, there can be indiscriminate sampling processes\nand discriminate sampling processes occurring in the same population,\neven with respect to the same trait. For example, in a study of over\n900 populations, biologist Maxime Lamotte acknowledged that camouflage\ngave appropriately colored Cepaea nemoralis land snails a\nselective advantage in their respective environment while\nsimultaneously maintaining that foundings of new populations are\n“of considerable importance because of the chance variations in\nthe composition of the first colonizers” (Lamotte 1959: 80); the\nvariations he refers to are variations in the colors of the snail\ncolonizers (Millstein 2009). Moreover, since the Causal Process\nAccount requires that variations be heritable, the non-heritable\nlocations of organisms are simply irrelevant for the purposes of\ndeciding on drift vs. selection; for example, the founders of a new\npopulation may all hail from the geographic edge of the original\npopulation, but they can still be an indiscriminate sample of the\nwhole. Finally, historically, at least (as discussed above), small\npopulation size has always been associated with drift, but it was\nnever the main phenomenon to be represented. Thus, the variant\nsampling accounts of drift should be evaluated in light of these\nconsiderations. \nWalsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002) provide a good entrée into\nunderstanding a mathematical approach to drift. They begin by\nacknowledging the historical uses of the term drift, identifying four:\n1) a “Sewall Wright Effect”, 2) a “Hagedoorn\nEffect”, 3) “Indiscriminate Sampling”, and 4)\n“The Finiteness of Natural Populations” (with some of\ntheir characterizations not fully accurate; e.g., with the first, they\nconflate Sewall Wright’s Shifting Balance Model where drift\nplays a role with drift itself). They suggest that these phenomena are\n“disparate” although they acknowledge, citing Beatty\n(1984), that the first three can be understood in terms of sampling.\nBut the fourth form, they assert, cannot. They describe the fourth\nphenomenon as follows: \nThe Hardy-Weinberg Law says that in infinite populations (of diploid\norganisms) there is no change in gene frequencies when there is no\nvariation in gene fitnesses. But natural populations are finite in\nsize; often they are small. In finite populations there will always be\nsome non-negligible chance that trait frequencies will diverge from\nexpectation. (Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002: 456) \nWith respect to this understanding of drift as the Hardy-Weinberg Law\nconjoined with a finite population, Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew maintain\nthat “there is no larger population literally being\nsampled” (2002: 459). Instead: \n…in these cases what happens is that the distribution of\nfitnesses in the population yields a prediction concerning the way in\nwhich a population will change. Drift is manifested as a difference\nfrom the outcome predicted by the fitnesses in the population. The law\nof large numbers tells us that the likelihood of significant\ndivergence from these predictions is an inverse function of the size\nof the population. The small size of a population increases the\nchances of error. (Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002: 459) \nWalsh, Lewens, and Ariew then state that this is the common feature\nthat the four types of drift they outline all share; thus drift, on\ntheir view, is when a series of births, survivals, deaths, and\nreproductions diverges from the outcome predicted by differences in\nfitness. Note that, using the terminology introduced in the previous\nsection, this is a purely outcome-oriented\n(“outcome-only”) definition of drift. Whatever type of\nprocess (if any) might have produced the outcome plays no role in the\ndefinition. Matthen (2010) defends a similar characterization of\ndrift: “Departures from expected values are what population\ngeneticists call ‘drift’” (Matthen 2010: 3). \nHowever, notice that the fourth drift “phenomenon” that\nWalsh, Lewens, and Ariew identify isn’t really a phenomenon.\nRather, it refers to a model from population genetics, the\nHardy-Weinberg model, and predictions based on that model. It is true\nthat as a consequence of the model, there would be no deviation from\nfitness expectations with an idealized infinite population (if we make\nsome philosophical assumptions about what happens in infinity; Sober\n(1984) raises questions about these assumptions), but that there would\nlikely be such deviations with a finite population. But this is a\npurely mathematical approach. The purely mathematical approach\ndoesn’t ask what phenomena the model is supposed to be modeling\nand why it is that finite populations are of interest. There is also\nno explanation of why a Hardy-Weinberg model with an assumption of\nfinite population size should count as drift; perhaps this is because\nof a philosophical tradition of referring to this as drift (e.g., some\nparts of Sober 1984 read that way), or perhaps it is because of the\npreviously-noted longstanding association between drift and small\npopulation sizes. In contrast, on the Causal Process Account of Drift,\ndrift would occur even in infinite populations as long as there is\nindiscriminate sampling; drift-like outcomes (deviation from fitness\nexpectations) are not required. \nMillstein, Skipper, and Dietrich (2009) challenge the outcome-only\napproach to defining drift and the purely mathematical approach that\nit is based on. Thus, there seem to be some meta-disagreements between\nthe process-only and outcome-only approaches to drift; should our\ndefinitions of drift look to the history of biology or should they\nlook to mathematics? Should we glean our understandings of drift from\nthe phenomena that biologists have sought to understand (the phenomena\nthat they developed models for) or from the models alone? If from the\nmodels alone, are we inadvertently drawing on the measure or\noperationalization of drift rather than drift itself (Plutynski 2007)?\nDiffering answers to these questions seem to be at the heart of the\ndiffering definitions of drift. \nIf one doesn’t interpret the model purely mathematically, but\ninstead considers what phenomenon the Hardy-Weinberg Principle\nwith-finite-populations is seeking to model, then there is indeed a\nlarger population being sampled. The equation models the changes from\none generation to the next; the original generation is the population\nthat is being sampled, and the next generation is the\n“sample”. That sample may or may not be representative of\nthe original population, e.g., a heterozygote Aa of the\noriginal generation may or may not have offspring in the proportions\n25% AA, 50% Aa, and 25% aa. \nThe mathematical-oriented outcome-only definition of drift is often\nassociated with the so-called “statisticalist” approach to\nevolutionary theory, but since it is simply a definition of drift and\nnot a metaphysical thesis it need not be. For example, a\nnon-statisticalist could consistently hold that natural selection is\ncausal (and thus, evolution would not be purely statistical, as it is\non the statisticalist interpretation), but that drift occurs when and\nonly when there is a deviation of the actual outcome from fitness\nexpectation. Indeed, Frédéric Bouchard and Alexander\nRosenberg (2004) seem to hold such a view. The intersection between\nissues of drift and the debates over statisticalism will be discussed\nfurther below. \nOther accounts of drift are not so easily classified. For example,\nTimothy Shanahan (1992) argues that conceptually, random drift and\nnatural selection are the ends of a continuum. However, to reach this\nconclusion, Shanahan must reject heritability as a necessary condition\nfor natural selection. As evolutionary biologist John Endler has\nargued, this has the effect of trivializing natural selection to the\nclaim that “there are differences among different\nphenotypes” (Endler 1986: 13). \nGrant Ramsey (2013) develops a concept he calls\n“driftability”, which locates drift in individual\norganisms rather than in a population. Ramsey points out that the\npossible lives that an organism can lead is a large and heterogeneous\nset; thus, the actual life that any particular organism leads will\nprobably not be a representative sample (which he seems to equate to\nan average) of the set. Differences within the set of will lead to\ndifferent evolutionary outcomes; this intra-organismic heterogeneity\nwithin the set of possible lives of an organism is driftability. \nPeter Godfrey-Smith (2009) characterizes drift as changes where two\nparameters, the smoothness of fitness landscapes and dependence of\nreproductive character on fitness differences, are low. (However, when\nhe needs to explicate why drift has special importance in small\npopulations and why it can be mathematically described in particular\nways, he appeals to indiscriminate sampling. Perhaps, then,\nindiscriminate sampling is at the core of Godfrey-Smith’s view\nof drift). \nAgain, these accounts, which seem to deviate significantly from\nbiological usage and practice, raise meta-philosophical issues about\nhow we ought to go about characterizing a scientific concept like\n“drift”. How far can the definition of a term deviate from\nscientific usage and practice and still be considered to be a\ndefinition of the same thing? \nOne could also be a pluralist about drift, arguing that there is\nreason to accept more than one definition of drift, although it is\nunclear if anyone has actually endorsed this position. Marshall Abrams\nseems to come the closest, stating: \nIf random drift is anything, it is not one thing…The term\napplies to many effects on populations or organisms which are said to\nbe due to “chance,” and to factors which are thought to\nhelp to produce such effects. (2007: 673) \nRecent debates about random drift are often entangled with debates\nover the purported purely statistical (non-causal) nature of\nevolutionary biology, but the issues are separable. There are issues\nconcerning random drift that do not involve questions of\nstatisticalism (as this article seeks to document), and there are\nissues concerning statisticalism that do not involve random drift\n(e.g., much of the literature focuses on natural selection rather than\nrandom drift). The statisticalist claim, generally traced to a pair of\npapers by Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002) and Matthen and Ariew\n(2002), is essentially that evolution is a population-level\nphenomenon, and that although there are causes at the level of\nindividual organisms (births, deaths, etc.), there are no causes at\nthe population level, only a statistical summary of the individual\nevents. Note that it is widely acknowledged that the models in\nevolutionary theory are statistical ones, so the distinctive\nstatisticalist claim is that evolutionary biology is purely\nstatistical. There are at least three alternatives to the\nstatisticalist claim; one challenges the claim that evolutionary\nbiology is a population-level phenomenon, arguing that it is\nconstituted by causes at the level of individual organisms (e.g.,\nBouchard and Rosenberg 2004), a second defends the view that there are\npopulation-level causes (e.g., Millstein 2006; Shapiro and Sober\n2007), while a third argues for causes at both levels (Pence\n2017). \nIt was already noted above (see\n section 2.3)\n that the outcome-only definition of drift is often adopted by\nstatisticalists, but not exclusively so; it can also be endorsed by a\ncausalist who, e.g., believes that natural selection is a causal\nprocess but that drift is simply deviation from selective\nexpectations. Perhaps surprisingly, it would also be possible for\nsomeone to endorse a version of the Causal Process Account of Drift\nand yet still accept the basic statisticalist premise—if one\nthought that drift should be understood in terms of indiscriminate\nsampling, and also thought that indiscriminate sampling should be\nunderstood in terms of causes at the level of individual organisms,\nthen the evolutionary changes wrought by drift would just be be the\nstatistical summation of individual level causes. In short, it would\nbe a mistake to infer one’s position on the statisticalist\ndebate from one’s definition of drift, although such slippage is\ncommon and the issues are in truth often entangled. \nWhat, then, are the statisticalist issues that random drift is\nentangled with? The concerns raised by Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002)\nand Matthen and Ariew (2002) have their origins in claims made by\nSober (1984) in his classic The Nature of Selection. Sober\ncharacterizes evolutionary theory as a theory of forces, with its\nzero-force state described by the Hardy-Weinberg equation of\npopulation genetics (see the\n population genetics entry\n for an explanation of the equation); in such a state, there is no\nselection, no mutation, no migration, no meiotic drive, random mating,\nand infinite population size. Thus, the Hardy-Weinberg equation is an\nidealized model that never obtains in the real world. It is a bit\ndifficult to see where drift fits into the equation, which is no doubt\nthe source of much of the confusion over how to define drift. In his\n1984 book, Sober alternatively characterizes drift in terms of random\nsampling (the process, which occurs, Sober explains, during gamete\nformation and the founding of new populations) and sampling error (the\noutcome, i.e., the deviation from fitness expectations). From the\npoint of view of process, at least some types of sampling could be\nunderstood to be part of the Mendelian process. The Mendelian process\nincludes the “process wherein organism produce gametes and\ngametes produce organisms” (Sober 1984: 35), which Sober says is\nnot treated as a force, but rather as the background against which\nevolutionary forces are described. But Sober does not take this route.\nInstead, Sober contrasts drift as sampling error (again, the\noutcome—presumably introduced when one relaxes Hardy-Weinberg\nassumptions to allow for finite populations) with selection, mutation,\nand migration; all are forces, Sober asserts, but drift is a different\nsort of force. It is not “deterministic” and it does not\nhave a definite direction (although it does have a magnitude,\ndetermined by the population size). That is, given trait frequencies\nand fitness values, Sober suggests, selection predicts a specific\noutcome for the next generation in a specific direction (and is in\nthis sense “deterministic”), whereas drift could yield an\nincrease any of the types present in the population (and is in this\nsense directionless). Moreover, Sober states, you cannot say how\nmuch drift has contributed a change relative to the change\nintroduced by selection; to do so would be as impossible as trying to\nsay, when flipping a fair coin ten times and obtaining six heads, how\nmuch of the result was due to the fairness of the coin and how much\nwas due to the fact that it was tossed ten times. He thus concludes\nthat “if drift is an evolutionary force, it is a force of a\ndifferent color” (1984: 117); he calls it a force, he says,\nmainly to indicate its causal role. \nThese metaphysical claims about drift (and selection and other\nevolutionary processes—but it is just drift that interests us\nhere) set the stage for the statisticalists’ challenge. Matthen\nand Ariew (2002) challenge the claim that there is a defensible sense\nin which drift is a force. Aside from the fact that it does not have a\npredictable or constant direction (as Sober readily acknowledges),\nthey point to a case of two similar populations subject to the same\nselective pressures, one in which the trait \\(T\\) becomes fixed and\nthe other in which the alternative trait \\(T'\\) becomes\nfixed. What explains the outcome in the two cases? Exactly the same\nthing, Matthen and Ariew assert, just as exactly the same coin setup\nexplains two heads and four heads in two series of ten coin tosses.\nThus, they seem to suggest, there is no additional cause or force,\n“drift”. Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew (2002) similarly attack\nSober’s claim that drift is a force; following Rosenberg (1994),\nthey assert that “the events that are labelled\n‘drift’ events, like lightning strikes, etc. are no\ndifferent in kind from selection events” (Walsh, Lewens, and\nAriew 2002: 457)—and thus, drift is not a distinct sort of\nforce. Moreover, they argue, drift is best interpreted statistically\nas statistical error (see argument in\n section 2.3),\n and so again, it is not a force. \nTo be clear, there is a historical component to the\nstatisticalists’ claims; on their view, Darwin’s\nevolutionary theory was causal, but with the introduction of\npopulation genetics, evolution became purely statistical. (It is\nsometimes unclear whether the statisticalists are making claims about\nmodels/theories or whether they are making ontological claims, or\nwhether they think that the latter can be inferred from the former).\nHodge (2016; see also Plutynski et al. 2016) challenges this\nhistorical claim by arguing that in fact Darwin—although he\nliked to think that his epistemological and nomological ideals were in\ndescent from Newton’s—never understood natural selection\nto be a lawful force along with gravitation or inertia. Hodge further\nargues that biologists today compare and contrast natural selection\nwith artificial selection and with drift in ways directly descending\nfrom Darwin’s view of natural selection as a causal process. \nA number of other philosophers have sought to challenge the\nstatisticalists’ claim that drift is not a force. For example,\nStephens (2004) defends the claim that drift is both a force and a\ncause. He asserts that if we understand drift properly as a process of\nindiscriminate sampling (instead of as an outcome, as the\nstatisticalists do), we can see that it is a force, but that in a\npopulation of a given size it always has the same force,\nregardless of whether there is a large or a small deviation from\nexpectation. (It may be that Sober’s inadvertent vagueness in\nhis 1984 book on the process/outcome question contributed to the\nconfusion, since the statisticalists were responding to Sober). He\nclarifies that, “because drift is a probabilistic cause, the\nsame causal force can have two different\noutcomes” (Stephens 2004: 557; emphasis in original). Stephens\nfurther defends the claim that drift can be understood as a force or a\ncause by arguing (contra Matthen and Ariew) that drift does\nhave a direction, namely, eliminating heterozygosity; that it can\n“make a difference” by affecting the probability of\nevolutionary change (more in small populations, less in large); and\nthat we can cogently speak of the relative importance of drift in an\nensemble of populations or in a population, albeit not at the level of\nindividuals (see Walsh 2007 for a response to Stephens 2004, 2010 and\nGildenhuys 2014 for a response to his response). \nBrandon (2006), however, argues that “eliminating\nheterozygosity” is not sufficient to show that drift is\ndirectional, given that (as Stephens would readily acknowledge) if\nthere were two alleles at a locus, beginning at equal frequencies, we\ncould not predict which of the two alleles would go to fixation, only\nthat one of them would; Brandon likens this to saying that “a\n20-Newton force is acting on object A”, (2006: 325),\nwhich, he seems to imply, is not a directional claim. Moreover, he\nargues, drift is not a separate process from selection. Thus, drift,\non Brandon’s view, is not a force (but it is a law; more on that\nbelow). Joshua Filler (2009) responds to Brandon by defending a more\nelaborated account of what a force is (in part drawing on Bigelow et\nal. 1988); on that elaborated account, drift’s direction can be\nseen as less specific than selection, mutation, and migration, but it\ngives some directional information. Thus, Filler argues, it can be\nseen as less “forcelike” than selection, mutation, and\nmigration, but it is still a force. Charles Pence (2017), however,\nworries that Filler’s modifications to our understanding of\n“force” may be ad hoc, so he offers an\nalternative defense of the claim that drift is a force. First, Pence\nargues, we already countenance forces that have stochastically\nspecified directions, such as Brownian motion, and drift is analogous.\nSecond, we can create an evolutionary thought experiment where drift\nis absent, showing that it is not constitutive of all evolving\nsystems; this is intended to respond to Brandon’s claim that\ndrift is not separable. Importantly, however, Pence points out that\nthere are essential questions that the entire debate has yet to\naddress: “what exactly the use of ‘forces’ is to do\nfor us, and when explanations utilizing a force metaphor are useful or\nperspicuous” (Pence 2017: 1975). \nOn the other hand, Kenneth Reisman and Patrick Forber (2005) separate\nthe question of whether drift is a force from the question of whether\ndrift is a cause, arguing only for the latter while not taking a stand\non the former. In a related paper, they rely on Woodward’s\n(2003) manipulability account of causation and a 1957 study of drift\nby Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky to argue that \ndecreasing the number of founding members in replicate populations\nproduces an increase in the variability of evolutionary outcomes\nacross those replicate populations. (Forber and Reisman 2007: 617) \nIn other words, they argue that the conditions of the study can be\nseen to satisfy the conditions of the manipulability account, showing\nthat drift ought to be understood as a (population-level) cause.\nShapiro and Sober (2007) state that they endorse Reisman and\nForber’s arguments as well as the view of drift as a process.\nHowever, it’s unclear whether Shapiro and Sober (or Reisman and\nForber) actually do endorse the view of drift as a process. That is,\nit’s unclear why population size as a causal factor should count\nas a process. \nThis is because it’s a bit unclear if drift is actually what is\nbeing manipulated in Dobzhansky and Pavlovsky’s (1957)\nexperiments, or if it is just population size—and population\nsize does not seem to be a process. Perhaps Reisman and Forber have\nsimply shown that population size is a causal factor of evolutionary\nchange in populations undergoing drift. They also seem to be taking\nWoodward’s account very literally, in that they seem to think\nthat the “variable” that has to be manipulated must be a\nvariable in a mathematical model; otherwise, one could (at least in\nprinciple) manipulate the sampling process by manipulating the\npopulation rather than simply the population size; Clatterbuck’s\n(2015) account, discussed in\n section 5,\n gives an example of this. (Population size is a variable in\nmathematical models of drift, whereas sampling, as discussed above, is\nimplicit). One could also conceivably manipulate the environment so\nthat sampling was discriminate rather than indiscriminate or to change\nthe nature of the indiscriminate sampling. \nPierrick Bourrat (2018) offers an alternative response to Reisman and\nForber; he implies that Reisman and Forber (2005) have overlooked\nWoodward’s criterion of invariance when they invoke the\nmanipulability account in support of drift as a population-level\ncause.  Invariance in an intervention, Bourrat states,\n“measures the extent to which a relationship between two\nvariables satisfying the manipulation condition remains stable or\nunchanged as various other changes are made in the background of this\nrelationship” (2018: 162), and, again invoking Woodward, he\nasserts that causal relationships that are more invariant provide\nbetter explanations. But, Bourrat argues, causal explanations in terms\nof individual-level variables are more invariant under intervention\nthan causal explanations in terms of population-level variables, and\nthus should be preferred for that reason. In other words, similar to\nBouchard and Rosenberg (2004) who are briefly mentioned above, Bourrat\ndefends a causalist position, but at the level of individuals rather\nthan at the level of populations. However, Bourrat does concede that\nit is reasonable to conceive of drift and natural selection as\npopulation-level causes when they depend on indeterministic events, as\nwell as for some cases of frequency-dependent selection. Moreover,\nBourrat does not discuss Clatterbuck’s (2015) alternative and\narguably superior understanding of the relevant manipulation for\ndrift; had he done so, it is not clear that his claim for the\nsuperiority of individual-level causal explanations with respect to\ndrift would follow. Again, though, these are disagreements within the\ncausalist camp. \nOther challenges to the statisticalists’ claims about drift as a\ncause neither endorse the view of drift as a force nor drift as a\ndistinct process. For example, Brandon and Ramsey (2007) see drift and\nselection as “copossible” outcomes of the same process.\nBut because there is a causal process—albeit only one\nrather than two—the statisticalists’ claims are not\nupheld. Abrams (2007) likewise seems loathe to adopt\n“force” talk about drift, at least in a strong realist\nsense. He argues that “both selection and drift are aspects of a\nprobability distribution over future frequencies of genotypes or\nphenotypes in a population” (2007: 667). Yet selection and drift\ncan be distinguished: \nSelection is the aspect of the distribution controlled by differences\nin fitness, while drift is the aspect of such a distribution\ncontrolled by population size (apart any from effects of population\nsize on fitness). (2007: 667) \nThis makes it sound as though Abrams is adopting a view of drift akin\nto that of Reisman and Forber, with its focus on population size, and\nindeed Abrams does elaborate on the causal role of population size,\nbut (as noted above) his views on drift are more accurately pluralist\nones. \nMore generally, Pence (2017) suggests one way of categorizing the\ndifferent causalist approaches (although not all of these have\nexplicitly addressed drift): \nAt the very least, we need to distinguish between (1) the force\ninterpretation, as discussed here; (2) the causal process approach\n(elaborated most notably by Millstein 2002, 2006, 2013); (3) the\ncausal mechanism approach, first deployed for natural selection by\nBarros (2008) and building on the work of Machamer et al. (2000); (4)\nthe manipulationist approach, discussed by Reisman and Forber (2005),\nForber and Reisman (2007), and Shapiro and Sober (2007), building on\nthe work of Woodward and Hitchcock (2003); and (5) the counterfactual\napproach, deployed for natural selection by Glennan (2009) and Huneman\n(2012) and utilizing a notion of counterfactual causal dependence or\n“relevance”. (Pence 2017: 1983) \nThroughout the 20th and 21st centuries,\nbiologists have struggled to detect drift empirically. In particular,\nthey have experienced challenges in differentiating cases of drift\nfrom cases of selection. The Causal Process Account of Drift in\nparticular can help to make sense of why this is so, as will be\ndiscussed below. Drift and selection may be different sorts of causal\nprocesses (indiscriminate and discriminate sampling, respectively),\nbut they can produce similar outcomes. Biologists have thus struggled\nto identify distinctive outcomes for drift and selection, only to find\nunderdetermination re-emerge after biologists modified or added to\ntheir assumptions about the relevant processes (for a clear\ncharacterization of this, see Dietrich and Skipper 2007). Relatedly,\nbiologists have also disagreed over the relative prevalence of drift\nand selection (Beatty 1995, 1997); as noted above, these disagreements\nwere there almost from the outset with Fisher’s response to the\nHagedoorns. \nThe disagreements over the prevalence of drift and selection began\nalmost immediately after Wright and Fisher incorporated drift into\ntheir evolutionary models (see Provine 1986 for an extended discussion\nof their disagreements, to which this discussion is very much\nindebted). Wright (1931a, 1932), drawing on his experience with animal\nbreeding, developed the Shifting Balance Theory (SBT), which consisted\nof three phases; these have been understood either as empirical claims\nabout actual conditions (Provine 1986) or descriptions of the ideal\nconditions for evolution (Skipper 2002). Skipper provides a clear\ndescription of the SBT as Wright would eventually formulate it (see\nHodge 2011 for discussion of early formulations): \nIn the first phase, random genetic drift causes gene frequencies to\nchange and pull subpopulations semi-isolated within the global\npopulation into adaptive valleys because random fluctuations in gene\nfrequencies are almost always maladaptive. In phase two, mass\nselection will then act within subpopulations and increase their\nfitness, dragging them from adaptive valleys to adaptive peaks. In the\nthird phase, selection between subpopulations, which Wright called\ninterdemic selection, driven by differential dispersion (migration of\norganisms from more fit subpopulations to less fit subpopulations)\nwould then enable the global population to be raised to its optimal\npeak. (Skipper 2002: 345) \nDrift, then, on Wright’s view, plays an essential role in the\nevolutionary process. Fisher, by contrast, thought that mass selection\non large populations was the predominant and most effective mode of\nevolution, leaving very little role for drift given the large\npopulation sizes. (This disagreement about the relative role of drift\nin evolution is one of several things that Wright and Fisher disagreed\nabout; e.g., as is clear from the above, they also disagreed about\npopulation structure and effective population size. See Skipper 2002,\n2009 and Plutynski 2005 for analyses of contemporary biologists who\ncontinue to argue the Wright-Fisher debate). \nAnother, related issue arose concerning the character of the traits\nthat were said to be subject to random drift. Wright’s early\nwritings, in particular, emphasized the nonadaptive character of the\ntraits undergoing drift and produced by drift (as can be see in\nSkipper’s characterization of Wright’s SBT above). But a\nnumber of potential confusions arise here (Provine 1986; Millstein\n2009): First, “nonadaptive” does not necessary mean\n“maladaptive”; it can also mean “neutral”.\nSecond, “nonadaptive” can refer either to the lack of\nadaptive differences between organisms or species, or it can refer to\nthe lack of adaptation to the environment (but authors are not always\nclear about which meaning is intended). So, one’s views on the\nprevalence of drift can be—and historically often have\nbeen—tied to one’s beliefs about the prevalence of\nadaptive traits (in either sense) in populations. Strictly speaking,\nhowever, there is no necessary connection between nonadaptive traits\nand drift; there can be indiscriminate sampling on organisms that are\nadapted to their environment and which differ in fitness, and the\noutcomes of that indiscriminate sampling can pull the population in an\nadaptive direction or a nonadaptive one. Thus, the proper\ncontrast between selection and drift does not map onto\n“adaptive” and “nonadaptive”, but rather to\n“adaptive” and “possibly nonadaptive” (but\nalso “possibly adaptive”). \nThese theoretical considerations were soon followed by field\nexaminations of drift (there were also laboratory studies, but these\nwere less contentious). Two sets of studies of natural populations are\nparticularly notable. One set, referred to in the introduction to this\nessay, is composed of the studies of the polymorphic land snail,\nCepaea nemoralis; these studies, and debates over the\nprevalence of drift, began in the 1930s and became quite heated in\n“The Great Snail Debate” of the 1950s and 1960s (Millstein\n2008, 2009 gives more extensive discussion, from which the following\nis drawn; the moniker “The Great Snail Debate” is due to\nProvine 1986). Early researchers, most famously Arthur J. Cain and\nPhilip M. Sheppard (1950, 1954), sought to demonstrate the adaptedness\nof the color and banding morphs of the snails as well as the sizes of\nthe populations in which they lived. But these were challenging to\ndetermine; adaptedness was primarily studied indirectly, by seeking\ncorrelations between variants and their backgrounds (presuming\ncamouflage and selection by predator), and population sizes varied\nconsiderably. And any correlations found were statistical ones, with\nlots of “noise”. This left the door open for drift; Maxime\nLamotte (1959) argued that by examining the populations as a whole,\none found greater variation among the small populations than among the\nlarge. This was a distinctive signature for drift, but such outcomes\nare hard to find and require a very special set of circumstances to\nobtain (large numbers of populations of varying sizes that are easy to\ncount). However, Lamotte’s study is not the only classic\nevolutionary study to exploit this unique drift outcome;\nCavalli-Sforza’s studies of blood groups in humans did so as\nwell (Richardson 2006). Notably, this was not drift as an\nalternative to selection (Cain and Sheppard had suggested\nthat selection precluded much of a role for drift), but rather, an\nargument for a substantial role for drift in addition to a\nsubstantial role for selection. \nAnother important set of studies is of the polymorphic Scarlet Tiger\nMoth, Panaxia dominula (see Provine 1986 for extended\ndiscussion, to which the following is indebted). Fisher and Ford\ndeliberately chose P. dominula because of its small\npopulation sizes, figuring that if they could make the case for\nselection against drift in its worst case, they could make a decisive\ncase against Wright, who they saw as advocating a form of nonadaptive\nevolution. But rather than trying to make a case for\nselection, as Cain and Sheppard did, Fisher and Ford (1947) tried to\nmake a case against drift by arguing that the fluctuations of\ngene frequencies across generations were too large to be accounted for\nby drift and that the size of the fluctuations did not differ between\nthe small and the large populations, as you would expect if they were\nundergoing drift. Therefore, they concluded, the populations were\nundergoing selection. Wright’s (1948) reply challenged both the\nlogic of this conclusion (disproving drift does not prove selection)\nas well as their characterization of his views, but more\nsignificantly, he pointed out that Fisher and Ford had not included\ndata on population sizes for the years in which the gene frequency\nfluctuations were statistically significant, so, in fact, it was\npossible that the populations had been undergone constrictions in\nthose years, in which case drift would have been able to\nproduce the observed fluctuations. He also pointed out that\nfluctuations in selection or migration (which he very problematically\nsuggested could be part of an expanded understanding of drift) could\nhave produced the same outcomes. \nIn short, the P. dominula studies turned on a slightly\ndifferent but related proposed unique outcome for drift, that of\nfluctuations over time rather than variation at a time as for C.\nnemoralis, in both cases comparing small populations to large (as\nwell as considering the capability of populations to produce large\nfluctuations), but with P. dominula, drawing definitive\nconclusions ran into difficulty from lack of data concerning the key\nvariable of population size. There is also the recognition that\nfluctuating selection can produce the same outcome of fluctuations of\ngene frequencies across generations as drift can, making it difficult\nto resolve the empirical case. Finally, note that biologists have\ncontinued to study both C. nemoralis and P.\ndominula, with the result that additional processes have been\nidentified that further complicate the empirical analyses (Millstein\n2008; Skipper 2009). \nAs Dietrich (1994) has documented, early work in molecular evolution\nwas focused almost exclusively on selection, something that changed\nwith the advent of the neutral theory of molecular evolution and the\nwork of Motoo Kimura, Jack King, and Thomas Jukes. Dietrich\nwrites: \nThe basis of its challenge was Kimura’s proposal that most\nchanges detected at the molecular level were not acted upon by natural\nselection; they were neutral, and the mechanism of their change was\nrandom genetic drift. (1994: 22) \nTo be clear, however, both selection and drift play an essential role\nin the neutral theory; on Kimura’s view, selection will quickly\neliminate the large number of deleterious mutants and fix the small\nnumber of advantageous ones, leaving the remaining mutant alleles as\nneutral, whereupon they undergo a process of drift (Dietrich 2006).\nDrift would eventually cause the neutral (and nearly neutral) mutants\nto either go to fixation or be lost (although they would be\npolymorphic in the meantime), so that observed molecular differences\nwould be \nthe outcomes of a random process of mutation, which Kimura understood\nas produced largely from DNA replication error, processes of\ndirectional selection, and processes of random drift produced by\ngamete sampling. (Dietrich 2006: 670) \nMany of the debates about the neutral theory contrasted this approach\n(the “neutralist” approach) to evolution with a more\nselectionist (or sometimes, “panselectionist”) approach,\ncausing many to refer to a “neutralist-selectionist\ncontroversy”. \nThe advocates of the neutral theory initially proposed it as an\nunrealistic simple model only to have subsequent data on the\nprevalence of neutral alleles convince them of its realism. That led\nto more explicit testing of the neutral theory and debates over the\nmolecular clock (Dietrich 2006). To focus on the first of these,\nDietrich (2006) suggests that although the neutral theory promised to\ngenerate numerous quantitative testable predictions—and\ndid—testing it has in fact proved difficult. Is this because of\nthe difficulty in identifying outcomes that are unique to drift?\nPerhaps so. For example, the neutral theory predicted a certain\nmeasure of heterozygosity, but when Francisco Ayala and colleagues\nfailed to observe that predicted outcome in a study of natural\npopulations of Drosophila, Jack King responded by saying that\nmany of the assumptions made by the model could be the source of the\ndiscrepancy. In other words, as has been well-discussed in the\nphilosophy of science, there are no “crucial experiments”\nbetween two theories because theories are always tested together with\ntheir assumptions, any one of which can be given up rather than\nrejecting the theory. Debates over the so-called “molecular\nclock” can also be understood in terms of the search for\ndistinctive outcomes for drift. At first, it was thought that only\ndrift could make sense of an apparent constant rate of\nevolution—that only drift would produce such an\noutcome—yet this time it is the selectionists who modified their\nassumptions such that their models would also predict a molecular\nclock outcome (Dietrich and Skipper 2007). \nSubsequently, Tomoko Ohta began to argue for a more significant role\nfor weakly selected mutants (Ohta 1973). Essentially, Ohta’s\ndefinition of “nearly neutral” includes mutants that are\nless neutral than Kimura’s “nearly neutral” mutants,\nand larger amounts of them as well (Dietrich and Millstein 2008).\nLater refinements included both slightly deleterious and slightly\nadvantageous mutants. This changes the processes that one would expect\nto be acting. With the (strictly) neutral theory, only drift would act\non the neutral mutants. With the nearly neutral theory, the nearly\nneutral mutations (whether advantageous or deleterious) would subject\nto very weak selection (discriminate sampling) and to drift\nin the form of indiscriminate gamete sampling (Dietrich and Millstein\n2008). Because the selection is weak, it would be swamped by the\neffects of drift, but both processes would still be occurring. Ohta\nbelieved that the nearly neutral theory could better account for the\nresults found by Ayala and his colleagues (with its large number of\nrelatively rare alleles), and also, that it could better explain some\nfeatures of the molecular clock (Dietrich and Millstein 2008).\nHowever, it has proven much more difficult to find unique outcomes for\nthe nearly neutral theory than the neutral theory. This makes the\nnearly neutral theory more difficult to test for and less useful as a\nnull hypothesis as compared to the neutral theory, even as it might\naccount for the available data better. \nHayley Clatterbuck, Elliott Sober, and Richard Lewontin (2013) argue\nthat it doesn’t make sense to talk of drift\n“dominating” selection or being “stronger\nthan” selection. (Among many such claims, this would challenge\nDietrich and Millstein’s (2008) claim, discussed in the previous\nsection, that the best way to understand the nearly neutral theory is\nas weak selection dominated by drift). Clatterbuck, Sober, and\nLewontin take selection and drift to be a population-level process or\nprocesses (they don’t take a stand on whether there is a one\nprocess or two, but they are clearly “causalists” rather\nthan “statisticalists”), but they raise concerns for the\nway that biologists have understood the value \\(Ns\\), which is the\neffective size of the population multiplied by the selection\ncoefficient. After some initial controversies over how to interpret\nthis value, most biologists eventually came to the view that \nselection “dominates” drift when \\(Ns\\) is much greater\nthan some specified number and that drift “dominates”\nselection when \\(Ns\\) is much less than that number, \nwith proposed numbers including 1/4, 1/2, and 1; in between values are\nthought to be where the two causes are more or less equal\n(Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin 2013). Clatterbuck, Sober, and\nLewontin point out that on the standard picture, the values of\nN and s do not predict one gene frequency outcome;\nrather, they predict a probability distribution of possible gene\nfrequency outcomes. But, they argue, you can change this distribution\nby changing N or by changing s, with values\n“chosen so that the first change makes more of a difference, or\nless, or the same, as you please”; thus, it is “arbitrary\nto focus on comparisons that give drift the upper hand, or that do the\nsame for selection” (Clatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin 2013:\n538). Here, the suggestion seems to be that N represents the\ndrift cause and that s represents the selection\ncause—although it’s not clear why drift-as-cause should be\nequated with population-size-as-a-cause—with the conclusion that\nthe causes are not separable. To say that they are separable would,\nClatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin say, would be akin to asking whether\nthe result of four heads of a fair coin tossed ten times is due to the\nfairness of the coin or the number of tosses. They also suggest that\nit is impossible to have a population that is not undergoing drift,\nsince even in an infinite population there could be deviation from\nselective expectations (again, making it hard to separate the causes).\nFinally, they argue that it doesn’t make sense to say that with\nidentical setups that producing differing outcomes, that selection\ndominates in some (when the favored allele increases in frequency) and\ndrift in others (when the favored allele decreases in frequency). \nRobert Brandon and Lenore Fleming (2014) point out, however, that\nClatterbuck, Sober, and Lewontin’s analysis of a seemingly\nempirical question is not based on an empirical discovery, but rather,\na conceptual analysis, and that as a conceptual analysis, it is not\nfully consistent; that is, they do not consistently treat drift as a\ncausal process, but sometimes treat it as an outcome (as in the last\npoint described in the previous paragraph). Brandon and Fleming cite\nseveral recent empirical studies where biologists seek to provide\nevidence that drift dominates selection, not relying on the simple\n\\(Ns\\) to come to that conclusion, and point out that there are other\nmethods for testing the relative strengths of drift and selection,\nsuch as the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test. In Brandon and\nFleming’s view, “drift is not a process. It is, however, a\npredictable result of a process, namely probabilistic sampling”\n(2014: 581). It is somewhat unclear, however, how on their view the\ndrift outcome (which outcome?) is “swamping” or\n“overriding” the selective outcome (presumably by the\noutcome being the cause of some further, as yet unidentified,\noutcome). Further elaboration on this point would be useful. \nIt has also been suggested, most notably by John Gillespie (2000a,b,\n2001), that many purported instances of genetic drift are in fact due\nto “genetic draft.” Genetic draft is a process of linked\nselection (a hitchhiking process) where it is a matter of chance which\nof two neutral alleles (in a two-locus model) happens to be linked to\na site that undergoes an advantageous mutation, and where the timing\nof these mutations, followed by a rapid selective “sweep”\nto fixation, is random. As Skipper (2006) discusses, one of the\ninteresting properties of genetic draft is that it can produce an\noutcome similar to that which one would expect from genetic drift in\nsmall populations, namely, a reduction in genetic variation (thus the\nsimilar name). Gillespie argues that draft is less sensitive to\npopulation size than drift, which leads him to claim that draft is a\nmore significant cause of evolution than drift (Skipper 2006). Thus,\ndraft introduces yet another relative significance debate (Beatty\n1995, 1997) to add to the others discussed in this article: drift vs.\nselection, Wright’s SBT vs. Fisher’s mass selection,\nneutralist vs. nearly neutralist vs. selectionist molecular evolution.\nHowever, it is worth noting that while draft can produce one of the\nsame outcomes that drift can (reduction in heterozygosity), it would\nnot give rise to fluctuating gene frequencies from one generation to\nthe next. So, not all drifty outcomes can be accounted for by\ndraft. \nWilliam Provine (2014) has taken the reduction of drift’s role a\nstep further, calling random genetic drift a “fallacy” and\narguing that no such phenomenon exists in nature, period. Provine\nnotes that for both Fisher and Wright (and even Kimura), drift was\ndeeply intertwined with inbreeding, to the extent that one was\nsometimes confused for the other, which seems warranted—or, at\nleast, that the relationship between the two was never fully clarified\n(see, e.g., Wright 1931a). Provine defines random drift as\n“fortuitous extinction of genes” at a genic locus on a\nchromosome. According to Provine, \nWright believed that random sampling of gametes in Mendelism produced\n“random genetic drift” at every locus [on every\nchromosome] in small populations, and also that inbreeding led to\nrampant “random genetic drift” in small populations\n(Provine 2014: 54). \nHere, Provine treats drift as an outcome, and as that outcome seems\nphysically unlikely or even impossible due to gene linkage, there is,\non his view, no drift. Wright did assert that \n[j]ust because the direction of drift is accidental, the result is a\nkaleidoscopic shifting of the average characters of the population\nthrough predominant types which practically are never repeated,\n(1931b: 207; see also Wright 1930: 354) \nbut that makes drift sound like a cause, not an outcome, and it does\nnot explicitly state that the “shifting” occurs at every\nlocus on every chromosome. But even if he did, Wright could certainly\nhave been mistaken about the effects of drift without being mistaken\nabout the phenomenon itself; notably, Provine does not deny the\nexistence of the random (i.e., indiscriminate) sampling of gametes,\nalthough he does object to the seeming reification of the term\n“gene pool” and the neglect of the relevance of\nchromosomes, points that are well-taken. \nAs noted above, the phenomenon of drift is represented in mathematical\nmodels of population genetics. The standard mathematical model of\ndrift found in textbooks is the Wright-Fisher model, the core of which\nis the binomial distribution, and it is the model that philosophers of\nbiology typically appeal to. In the Wright-Fisher model—an\nidealized model, as all models are—there are assumed to be\n\\(N\\) diploid adults in a population, mating randomly, with an\nallele \\(A\\) that has a frequency of \\(p_0\\) and an alternate\nallele at the same locus. The model further assumes that adults\nproduce an infinite number of gametes having the same allele\nfrequency. \\(2N\\) gametes are drawn from the “gamete pool”\nat random to constitute the \\(N\\) diploid individuals of the next\ngeneration. (See Ishida and Rosales 2020 for important clarifications\non the historical development of the Wright-Fisher model). \nHowever, as Millstein, Skipper, and Dietrich (2009) point out, the\nWright-Fisher model is quite idealized, since, of course, \npopulations do not reproduce by calling in their local statistician\nand asking her to pick exactly \\(2N\\) gametes at random (with\nreplacement) and toss them into the next generation (Gillespie 2004:\n49) \n—but there are more realistic alternatives. John\nGillespie’s model, for example, similarly assumes a diploid\npopulation of \\(N\\) members and a two-allele locus, with\nfrequencies \\(p\\) and \\(q = (1 - p)\\); it also similarly assumes\nrandom mating. Where it differs from the Wright-Fisher model is that\neach of the \\(2Np A\\) gametes constitutes the next generation with a\nrandom number of offspring gametes. There is no restriction\non the distribution of the numbers of offspring nor on the total\nnumber of offspring gametes. Thus, unlike the Wright-Fisher model,\nGillespie’s model is not tied to binomial sampling,\nalthough sampling more generally is still being modeled. Millstein,\nSkipper, and Dietrich suggest that the philosophical significance of\nsuch alternative models (including others such as the Moran model, the\nCannings model, or the coalescent) is that we need to be careful about\ndrawing conclusions about drift from any one particular mathematical\nmodel, always keeping in mind Giere’s (1988) point that models\nare built as representations of specific aspects of physical\nsystems. \nClatterbuck (2015) similarly reminds the philosophical community that\nit is a mistake to just focus on the Wright-Fisher model, highlighting\nthe Eldon–Wakeley model in particular. She emphasizes that\ndifferent drift models are not predictively equivalent, so that\ndetails of the causal network (represented by the differing\nassumptions of the different models) underlying a population can be\nseen to change the outcomes of drift. This challenges\nstatisticalists’ assumptions that drift is purely mathematical.\nRelatedly, she argues that broadening our conception of drift to\ninclude alternative models reveals novel ways of intervening on drift\nthat strengthen the causal argument against its statisticalism. For\nexample, by intervening \non the population in such a way as to increase the probability that\nindividuals have a far greater number of offspring (relative to the\npopulation size) than allowed by the Wright–Fisher model \nwe would increase the probability of a neutral allele increasing in\nfrequency (2015: 3501). This is an improvement over Reisman and\nForber’s manipulationist arguments (discussed above), since it\nis more clearly the drift (the sampling process) that is being\nmanipulated rather than just population size. \nBut perhaps drift is more than just a model (or a set of models);\nperhaps it is a scientific law of evolutionary biology. Or so Brandon\n(2006) argues, dubbing a “Principle of Drift” analogous to\nthe Principle of Inertia in that both are intended to be\n“zero-force” laws. According to the Principle of\nDrift, \nand \nOn this view, drift—and thus change—is the default state\nof evolutionary systems, challenging Sober’s view (discussed\npreviously), that the Hardy-Weinberg Principle characterizes the\nzero-force state in evolutionary biology. In defending the Principle\nof Drift, Brandon challenges those who would argue that there are no\nlaws of biology (e.g., Beatty 1995; see cites within), although\nBrandon (1990) had already done so by defending a Principle of\nSelection (see also the related work by McShea and Brandon 2010, in\nwhich drift is characterized as a special case of what they dub the\n“Zero-Force Evolutionary Law”, or ZFEL). \nPhilosophical discussions of random genetic drift have been lively and\nfruitful. But as they are still relatively recent, there are many\nissues yet to be explored or explored fully. Although much energy has\nbeen diverted toward debating statisticalism, there are many debates\nover drift that biologists are engaged in that philosophers could\nprofitably weigh in on, both historical and contemporary. With respect\nto the last two sections of this article in particular (empirical\nissues concerning drift and models of drift), we may have only begun\nto scratch the surface.","contact.mail":"rlmillstein@ucdavis.edu","contact.domain":"ucdavis.edu"}]
