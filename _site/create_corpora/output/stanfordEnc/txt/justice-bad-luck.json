For instance, some die young due to a genetic disease,\nwhereas others live long lives. Are such differential luck induced\ninequalities unjust? Many are inclined to answer this question\naffirmatively. To understand this inclination, we need a clear account\nof what luck involves. On some accounts, luck nullifies\nresponsibility. On others, it nullifies desert. It is often said that\njustice requires luck to be ‘neutralized’. However, it is\ncontested whether a distributive pattern that eliminates the influence\nof luck can be described. Thus an agent’s level of\neffort—something few would initially see as a matter of\nluck—might be inseparable from her level of\ntalent—something most would initially see as a matter of\nluck—and this might challenge standard accounts of just\ndeviation from equality (or, for that matter, other favored\ndistributive patterns). Critically, relational egalitarians argue that\nso-called luck egalitarians’ preoccupation with eliminating\ninequalities reflecting differential bad luck misconstrues justice,\nwhich, according to the former, is a matter of social relations having\na suitably egalitarian character.\n\n\n\nLuck is a pervasive feature of human life (Williams 1981, 21). It\nappears to arise in four main ways (Nagel 1979; Statman 1993, 11).\nFirst, the outcomes of our actions are affected by luck (resultant\nluck). In the mid-1990es it may have seemed prudent to take a degree in\ncomputer science; someone who did so and completed a course just\nbefore the IT bubble burst unforeseeably in 2000 may rightly see her ensuing\nunemployment as bad resultant luck. Second, the circumstances in which\none acts introduce luck (circumstantial luck). A person who is offered\nproper incentives and plenty of time to deliberate may make a wiser\ndecision than she would under less favorable conditions; it may be by\naccident that she finds herself in the favorable conditions and hence\nmakes the wiser decision (but see Pritchard 2005, 254–261). Third,\nluck affects the kind of person you are (constitutive\nluck). Genetically, some people are at greater risk of cancer through\nsmoking than others, and because of this it makes sense to say that\nsome smokers are lucky to avoid cancer. Finally, there is luck in the\nway one’s actions are determined by antecedent circumstances\n(antecedent causal luck). Children who grow up in a stimulating\nenvironment perhaps become more motivated than they would in a duller\nsetting; yet children rarely determine the time and place in which\nthey are raised. When we add up resultant, circumstantial,\nconstitutive, and antecedent causal luck, the area of life that is\nfree of luck seems to shrink “to an extensionless point”\n(Nagel 1979, 35; compare Parfit 1995, 10–12; Levy 2014).  Luck that does not affect a person’s interests is irrelevant from\nthe point of view of justice. But luck that does—whether the\ninterests are characterized in terms of welfare, resources,\nopportunities, capabilities to achieve functionings, or in some other\nway—certainly seems relevant. People who end up less well (or\nbetter) off than others as a result of luck often ask “Why\nme?” (Otsuka 2004, 151–152). For instance, many affluent\npeople, reflecting on the situation of people in developing countries,\nwould be inclined to think that it is simply the latter’s bad luck to\nhave been born in poor countries. They would further assume that it is\ntheir own good luck to have been born in affluent countries, that they\ndo not deserve their favorable starting position, and that this makes\nthe inequality unjust. If those who live in developing countries were\nin the situation they find themselves in through their own fault, and\nnot victims of bad luck, no question of distributive justice would\narise. But they are not, and it seems unfair and unjust that some\npeople’s prospects are worse than others’ simply in virtue of\nbirthplace (Caney 2005, 122; for opposing considerations see Miller\n2007, 56–75). The underlying assumption seems to be that\nluck-affected differential standings are morally undesirable or unjust\n(Arneson 1989, 85; Tan 2012, 149–185; Temkin 1993, 200); but\nthis assumption calls for philosophical clarification. Given the\npervasiveness of luck, such clarification appears to be required\nwhenever people end up unequally well off. \n\nIt is commonplace to distinguish between retributive justice and\ndistributive justice. In both cases the issue of bad luck arises, and\noffhand it seems that the role one ascribes to luck in one area will\nconstrain the role one can ascribe to luck elsewhere: if luck raises\nquestions about the significance of desert in the sphere of\ndistributive justice, it will probably have similar repercussions\nvis-a-vis desert and retributive justice (Sandel 1982, 91–92;\nScheffler 1992, 306). In the present entry, however, we shall focus on\nrelations between luck and distributive justice.  In fact it will be useful to narrow the focus further to a\nparticular family of theories of distributive justice—namely,\nthose involving an end-result principle of justice (Nozick 1974,\n153–155). End-result principles entail that one can judge\nwhether a certain distribution of goods is desirable without knowing\nhow it came about. The following are well-known principles of this\nkind and/or theories giving a central role to them. (a) Crude\negalitarianism, given which it is bad or unjust if some people are\nworse off than others. (b) Crude sufficientarianism, given which it is\nbad or unjust if some people do not have enough of whatever is the\nrelevant currency of distributive justice (Frankfurt 1988,\n134–158; see also Axelsen and Nielsen 2015; Casal 2007; Huseby 2010; Shields 2012). (c)\nPrioritarianism, given which we should maximize the sum of welfare\nthat is weighted to ensure that benefits at lower levels of welfare\nhave more weight than those at higher levels (Holtug 2010,\n202–243). (d) The difference principle, given which it is unjust\nif the worst off are less well off than they could be. (Strictly\nspeaking, Rawls himself says that the difference principle applies to\nthe basic structure of society (Scheffler 2006, 102–110; compare\nCohen 2000, 134–147; Cohen 2008, 116–180), so for Rawls it\napplies only indirectly to outcomes. On this understanding, the\ndifference principle is not, in any straightforward sense, an\nend-state principle. Here we prefer to treat the difference principle\nas one that applies directly to outcomes. Many observers handle the\ndifference principle this way, and some subscribe to such a principle\non merit, regardless of whether it should be labeled “the\ndifference principle.” Some writers, such as G. A.  Cohen, think\nthat Rawls ought to understand his principle in this way, in view of\nthe principle’s rationale.) Finally, there is (e) utilitarianism,\ngiven which we should maximize the sum of welfare. \n\nThere are two reasons for narrowing the focus in this way. First, some\nend-result principles have been defended on the basis of\nconsiderations about luck. Thus it is often suggested that\nconsiderations about neutralizing luck favor the difference principle\nover ‘historical’ principles of justice, i.e., principles\ndefining justice in terms of the way a distribution of goods comes\nabout. No such suggestion has been made on behalf of non-end-result\nprinciples. Take Nozick’s entitlement view. On this view, it may be a\nmatter of luck what people are entitled to, and yet Nozick explicitly\nclaims that this does not erode the relevant entitlements (Nozick\n1974, 225). Second, many have inserted into end-result principles\nclauses that allow for deviations from the prescribed end-result\nprovided that these deviations do not reflect luck. For instance, most\ncontemporary egalitarians believe that an unequal distribution that is\nnot a matter of bad luck for the worse off could be just. Luck plays\nno comparable role in historical principles. The important conceptual\npoint is that, as Arneson puts it, we should distinguish the\nluckist element in a theory of distributive justice from\nthe end-result favored by the theory, when setting aside\nluckist concerns (Arneson 2006; Lippert-Rasmussen forthcoming). \n\nJohn Rawls’ work explains why the concept of luck has had a central\nplace in discussions of justice over the last 30 years. In an\nimmensely influential section of his A Theory of Justice he\nintroduced the metaphors of the social and natural lotteries (for a\nbrief overview over Rawls’ appeal to luck and the legacy of this\nappeal, see Knight and Stemplowska 2011, 2–9). The underlying idea is\nthat every person’s starting point in society is the outcome of a\nsocial lottery (the political, social, and economic circumstances into\nwhich each person is born) and a natural lottery (the biological\npotentials each person is born with). Rawls says that the outcome of\neach of person’s social and natural lottery is, like the outcomes of\nordinary lotteries, a matter of good or bad “fortune” or\n“luck” (Rawls 1971, 74, 75).  Hence, since one cannot\npossibly merit, or deserve, an outcome of this kind, people’s starting\npositions cannot be justified by appeal to merit or desert (Rawls\n1971, 7, 104). It can be seen, then, that Rawls’ social and natural\nlotteries provide negative support of his theory of justice. They\nundermine alternative theories in which distributions of social and\neconomic benefits deviating from that prescribed by the difference\nprinciple are tolerated (Nozick 1974, 216; Arneson 2001, 76). They\nalso underpin Rawls’ claim that a system of natural liberty—one\nin which formal equality of opportunity obtains in that “all\nhave at least the same legal rights to all advantaged social\npositions” (Rawls 1971, 72) and applicants are assessed on their\nmerits alone—is unjust because “it permits distributive\nshares to be improperly influenced by” the outcomes of the\nsocial and natural lottery. \n\nLuck also plays an important positive role in Rawls’ work.  Since we\ncan regard people’s natural talents as a matter of luck, it is\nappropriate, Rawls thinks, to regard their distribution as a\n“common asset and to share in the benefits of this distribution\nwhatever it turns out to be.” This means that “[t]hose who\nhave been favored by nature…. may gain from their good fortune\nonly on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost\nout” (Rawls 1971, 101. This point is put somewhat less strongly\nin the second edition of\nA Theory of Justice). This is exactly what the difference\nprinciple, in one of its versions, says. Moreover, if we assume an\nindependently plausible principle of redress which says that\n“undeserved inequalities… are to be compensated\nfor”, and if people’s lives are shaped by undeserved\noutcomes of the social and the natural lottery, then we can say that\nthe difference principle “does achieve some of the intent of the\n[principle of redress]” (Rawls 1971, 101). (While it is\nundeniable that luck plays a role in A Theory of Justice, and\nthat the considerations described above are congenial to\nluck-egalitarians, some commentators argue that this role is\nexaggerated and misconceived when Rawls is understood in\nluck-egalitarian fashion (Scheffler 2003, 8–12, 24–31; Scheffler 2005;\nScheffler 2006; Freeman 2007, 111–142; Mandle 2009,\n24–29). In Section 8, we ask whether the luck-neutralizing aim\ncan play a positive role in justifying equality, an issue that is, of\ncourse, distinct from the question whether it has been widely thought\nto be capable of playing such a role.)  Luck has been examined closely in the writings of successive\negalitarians (Arneson 1989; Arneson 2011; Cohen 2008; Cohen 2011;\nDworkin 2000; Nagel 1991; Rakowski 1991; Roemer 1993; Roemer 1996;\nRoemer 1998; Temkin 1993). (While the philosophers mentioned here are\noften referred to as luck egalitarians, not all of them\nfavor this label (e.g., Dworkin 2003, 192; cp. Arneson\nforthcoming)). Ronald Dworkin holds that differences in wealth\ngenerated by differences “traceable to genetic luck”\n(Dworkin 2000, 92) are unfair. He describes a hypothetical insurance\ndevice which, on the one hand, neutralizes “the effects of\ndifferential talents” (Dworkin 2000, 91) and, on the other hand,\nis insensitive to the different ambitions people have in their lives\n(Kymlicka 2002, 75–79). Similarly, G. A. Cohen writes that\n“anyone who thinks that initial advantage and inherent capacity\nare unjust distributors thinks so because he believes that they make a\nperson’s fate depend too much on sheer luck” (Cohen 2011,\n30). In his view, “the fundamental distinction for an\negalitarian is between choice and luck in the shaping of people’s\nfates” (Cohen 2011, 4). \n\nGenerally speaking, sufficientarians do not incorporate a\nluckist element into their views about distributive\njustice. A sufficientarian theory that does so might say, e.g., that\nit is unjust if some people do not have enough through no fault or\nchoice of their own (luck-sufficientarianism, we might\ncall this view). The reason sufficientarians tend not to endorse some\nsuch view is that they believe that people are entitled to a certain\nminimum, however they exercise their responsibility. \n\nLuck is also appealed to by some who believe that benefits matter\nmore, morally speaking, the worse off those to whom the benefits\naccrue are. Thus Richard J. Arneson has defended a version of\nprioritarianism accommodating the “generic egalitarian\nintuition” that “fortunate individuals should give up\nresources to improve the life prospects of those whose initial\nconditions are unpropitious [i.e., the upshot of bad luck]”\n(Arneson 1999, 227). According to this view, “the moral value of\nachieving a gain (avoiding a loss) for a person” is\n“greater, the lower the person’s lifetime expectation of\nwell-being prior to receipt of the benefit (avoidance of the\nloss)” and “greater, the larger the degree to which the\nperson deserves this gain (loss avoidance)” (Arneson 1999,\n239–240). \n\nFinally, while no one has argued that utilitarianism is grounded in\nreflections on luck, it has certainly been argued that non-luck\nconsiderations qualify our obligation to maximize welfare.\nFred Feldman, for instance, defends a version of consequentialism that\nadjusts utility for justice on the basis that a pleasure is more\nvaluable if it is deserved and less valuable, or perhaps even\ndisvaluable, if it is undeserved (Feldman 1997). Given an appropriate\naccount of desert, this position might be looked upon as\nluck-utilitarianism (or luck-consequentialism). On one version of this\nkind of view (one differing from Feldman’s), the moral value of\nan outcome always increases with increasing welfare for individuals.\nBut as is the case with Arneson’s responsibility-sensitive\nprioritarianism, on this view the moral value of an extra unit of\nwelfare to a person is “greater, the larger the degree to which\nthe person deserves this gain (loss avoidance).” \n\nThe concept of luck is a curious one (Dennett 1984, 92; see also\nPritchard 2005, 125–133; Pritchard and Whittington 2015). To\navoid various pitfalls, it helps to distinguish thin and thick notions\nof luck (as suggested by Hurley 2002, 79–80; Hurley 2003,\n107–109; Vallentyne 2006, 434). To say that\nsomething—whether a choice or an outcome (other than choice)\n(Olsaretti 2009; Scheffler 2003, 18–19)—is a matter\nof thin luck for someone is to say merely that this person\ndoes not stand in a certain moral relationship to a certain object,\nwhere such moral relationship essentially involves this individual in\nhis or her capacity as a rational agent. To say that something is a\nmatter of thick luck is to say this and to commit oneself to\na certain account of the non-moral properties in virtue of which this\nmoral relationship obtains. Accordingly, a thick concept of luck is a\nmore specific version of the corresponding thin concept of luck. In\neither case, to say that something is a matter of luck for someone, in\nthe sense of “luck” that is relevant to justice, is to\nimply that it affects this person’s interests for good or bad (see,\nhowever, Sher’s discussion (2014, 20–34) of whether the relevant\nobjection to luck applies to people’s absolute or comparative\ndistributive positions). \n\nThere are several varieties of thin notions of luck. One is the\nfollowing kind of responsibility luck: \n\nIn this definition, like those set out below, “X”\nranges over individuals and “Y” ranges over items\nthat can be a matter of luck for an individual, e.g., events, states\nof affairs, personality traits, actions, omissions, and much else.  A\nnumber of views about what makes an agent responsible for something\nhave been taken (for an overview, see Matravers 2007, 14–64). On\nresponsibility for actions (and omissions), (a) some emphasize the\nrole of the ability to act otherwise (Ayer 1982; Moore 1912), (b)\nothers focus on whether an act is appropriately related to the agent’s\nreal self (Frankfurt 1988; Watson 1982), and (c) yet others think that\nwhat matters is whether the agent acted from a suitable\nreasons-sensitive mechanism (Fischer and Ravizza 1998; Fischer\n2006). To say that an outcome conforms to (1) is to remain neutral on\nwhich of these accounts is correct. (It has become common to\ndistinguish between attributive and substantive responsibility\n(Scanlon 1999, 248–251; Scanlon 2006, 72–80). The former concerns what\ncomprises a suitable basis for moral appraisal of an agent. The latter\nconcerns what people are required to do for one another. While the\nissue of luck arises in relation to both senses of responsibility, it\nis the latter which is crucial to distributive justice). \n\nThin notions of luck need not be notions of responsibility luck.  Thus\nthe following notion of desert luck is thin:  As with responsibility, a number of views about what makes an\nagent deserving are possible (Kagan 2012, 6–7; Sher 1987,\n7). Some accounts hold the basis of desert to be the value of one’s\ncontribution, while others hold the desert basis to be one’s level of\neffort. People who think that justice should neutralize the luck\nspecified by (2) can disagree over these accounts. \n\nIt is worth emphasizing that thin responsibility luck and thin desert\nluck are independent of one another. First, X may be\nresponsible for Y and yet not deserve Y. Thus a man\nwho heroically throws himself on to a grenade to save his comrades,\nthereby losing his life, is responsible for his own death—indeed\nthis is what makes his act praiseworthy—even if he did not\ndeserve to die. Second, X may deserve Y without\nbeing responsible for Y. Thus a poor saint who stumbles,\nentirely fortuitously, upon a gold nugget might deserve (in the wider\nscheme of things) to be enriched by his discovery even though he is\nnot responsible for making it. \n\nOther thin notions of luck can be described, but thin desert luck and\n(especially) thin responsibility luck have received the lion’s share\nof attention in the literature on distributive justice. While clearly\ndifferent, they are occasionally conflated (as pointed out in Hurley\n2003, 191–95). \n\nThe claim that something is a matter of thin responsibility luck can\nbe combined with various accounts of responsibility and thus various\naccounts of luck. It is these latter accounts—thick\naccounts of responsibility luck—that tell us what makes a person\nresponsible for something. On the thick, control-based account of\nresponsibility luck: \n\nA competing thick, choice-based account of responsibility luck\nsays: \n\nTo see how these control-based and choice-based notions diverge,\nconsider a Frankfurtian scenario in which Y comes about as a\nresult of X’s choice, but X did not control whether\nY came about because had X not chosen to bring about\nY, then Y would have been realized through some\nalternative causal means (Frankfurt 1988). Conversely, in a case in\nwhich X fails to make up his mind whether to prevent\nY coming about and then finds he can no longer control the\noutcome, it might be said that Y does not come about as a\nresult of X’s choice even if X controlled\nY. \n\nOften it makes a crucial difference which items Y ranges over\n(see Cohen 2011, 25, 93; Price 1999). Suppose, for instance, that a\nperson deliberately, and in full control, cultivates a preference for\nspending leisure hours driving about in her car reasonably foreseeing\nthat the prices of gas will stay low (Arneson 1990,\n186). Unfortunately, and unpredictably, the price of gas skyrockets\nand her preference becomes very costly. In this case, the fact that\nthis person prefers to spend her leisure hours driving her car is\nneither bad control luck, nor bad choice luck. However, the fact that\nshe is worse off as a result of her preference may be both, since she\nneither chose to act in such way to make this fact obtain, nor\ncontrolled whether it did. We might say of this person that she had\nbad price luck \n\nIt has been argued that both the control-based and choice-based thick\nnotions of luck are too broad. Most people neither control nor choose\ntheir religion, yet it seems odd to ask for compensation for feelings\nof guilt engendered by religious belief on the grounds that it is a\nmatter of bad luck that one holds those beliefs (Scanlon 1975; Cohen\n2011, 33–37). To accommodate this intuition G. A. Cohen introduces\nthe notion of counterfactual choice. One can explain this\nnotion with the following claim: \n\nGiven the opportunity to do so, the theist would not choose to be free\nof the feelings of guilt engendered by his religious convictions.\nTherefore, it is not a matter of luck that he has such feelings and so\njustice does not require him to be compensated for the feelings. As\nCohen says, the costs of the unchosen and uncontrolled commitments of\nthe religious believer “are so intrinsically connected with his\ncommitments that they” are not bad luck (Cohen 2011, 36;\ncompare Cohen 2011,88; Sher 2014, 64–66). Hence, if by “responsible for” we\nsimply mean “should bear the costs of” (compare Ripstein\n1994, 19n), the theist is responsible for his religiously mandated\nfeelings of guilt. \n\nJust as there are different accounts of thick responsibility luck,\nthere are different accounts of thick desert luck. These correspond to\ncompeting accounts of the basis of desert. One notion is that of\nthick, non-comparative desert luck, which can be elaborated as\nfollows: \n\nThe notion fleshed out here contrasts with that of thick,\ncomparative desert luck: \n\nIt may be a matter of bad thick, non-comparative desert luck that the\ncrops of a talented, hard-working farmer are destroyed by cold\nweather. If, however, the crops of a farmer who is even more\nhard-working and talented are also destroyed, it will not be a matter\nof bad thick, comparative desert luck that the first farmer’s\ncrops are destroyed. \n\nThe list of thick notions of luck mentioned so far is not intended to\nbe exhaustive, and each notion may of course be developed in several\ndirections. Clearly, thick luck is quite complex. \n\nSome accounts of luck are neither thin accounts of luck nor aim at\ncapturing a general moral notion such as responsibility or desert.\nInstead they appeal to an independent conception of luck. Lottery luck\nis arguably one example: \n\nThe underlying idea here is that there is a sense in which the outcome\nof a (fair) lottery is a matter of luck for the person who\nparticipates in it whether or not he is responsible for it—as\nsome accounts of responsibility imply and others do not. It can be\nmaintained that justice is concerned with this notion of luck\nindependently of how it relates to responsibility and desert. Thus an\negalitarian may think that it is bad if people are unequally well off\nas a result of differential lottery luck even if he has not made up\nhis mind whether people are responsible for differential lottery\nluck. He might add that it would be illegitimate for the state to\nenforce equality in face of inequality resulting from a fair lottery\nto which all parties consented. Also, lotteries might be excellent\nmeans of making outcomes independent of the unjust biases of\ndistributors (compare Stone 2007, 286–287), even if outcomes might be\nunjust despite the fact such biases played no role in their\ngenesis. \n\nIn principle, one could also care about choice and control luck\nindependently of how these relate to thin luck, e.g., responsibility\nand desert. However, philosophers who think that justice is a matter\nof eliminating differential luck have studied choice and control\nmainly because they assume that the absence of choice and control\nnullifies responsibility or desert. \n\nAccounts of responsibility or desert affect how much luck there is in\nthe world. If, on the one hand, one accepts a hard deterministic\naccount of responsibility, everything is a matter of responsibility\nluck. A hard deterministic account of responsibility says that\nresponsibility and determinism are incompatible, that determinism is\ntrue, and, hence, that no one is ever responsible for anything. Most\nbelieve that, if hard determinism is true, extensionally speaking,\nluck-egalitarianism collapses into straight equality of outcome (e.g.,\nSmilansky 1997, 156; but see Stemplowska 2008). If, on the other hand,\none accepts a compatibilist, reason responsiveness account of\nresponsibility, many outcomes will not be a matter of responsibility\nluck, at least for some agents. A compatibilist, reason responsiveness\naccount of responsibility for outcomes says that an agent is\nresponsible for outcomes that he or she brings about in the right sort\nof way through the agent’s actions (or omissions) where these issue\nfrom an action-generating process that is sufficiently sensitive to\npractical reasons, e.g., normal human deliberation, and that actions\nmay issue from such mechanisms whether or not determinism obtains\n(Fischer and Ravizza 1998). Still, agents who act from reason\nresponsive mechanisms may face choice situations that differ much in\nterms of how favorable they are in which case inequalities reflecting\nsuch differences may not be just, even if they obtain between agents\nwho are responsible for the choices they made. For this reason (among\nothers), it is open for compatibilist luck-egalitarians to think that\nlittle inequality can be justified by differential exercises of choice\n(see Barry 2005). \n\nOne issue which has received quite a lot of attention in the debate\nabout justice and luck is the regression principle governing luck: \n\nIf this principle is coupled with control or choice accounts of luck,\neverything turns into luck. For if we couple (9) with, say, the thick,\nchoice-based account of responsibility luck, it follows that for my\npresent reckless driving not to be a matter of (bad) luck, it will\nhave to be the case that I am responsible for, and hence have chosen,\nthe causes of my present reckless driving. In turn, for me to be\nresponsible for these causes I will in turn have to be responsible\nfor, and hence have chosen, the causes of these causes of my reckless\ndriving; and so on. Obviously, at some point, moving back through the\ncausal chain (e.g., prior to my coming into existence, if not long\nbefore that), choice, and thus responsibility, will peter out. So it\nwill follow that I am not responsible for my present reckless driving:\nit is my bad luck that I drive my car in a totally irresponsible way.\nGeneralizing this sort of reasoning, no one would ever be\nresponsible for anything—that everything would be a matter of\nresponsibility luck. As Thomas Nagel writes “Everything seems to\nresult from the combined influence of factors, antecedent and\nposterior to action, that are not within the agent’s control. Since he\ncannot be responsible for them, he cannot be responsible for their\nresults” (Nagel 1979, 35; compare Strawson 1994; Watson 2006, 428). \n\nThe view that everything is a matter of responsibility (and desert)\nluck obviously flies in the face of our everyday ascriptions of\nresponsibility. Accordingly, this implication of the regression\nprinciple is often deployed in a corresponding reductio ad absurdum\n(Hurley 1993, 183; Hurley 2003; Nozick 1974, 225; Sher 1997, 67–69;\nZaitchik 1977, 371–373). However, this reductio is perhaps too hasty.\nIt has been argued that the principle (applied to control) is not\nsimply a matter of “generalization from certain clear\ncases.” Rather, it is a condition that we “are actually\nbeing persuaded” is correct when we apply it to cases\n“beyond the original set”, where, on reflection, we find\nthat “control is absent” (Nagel 1979, 26–27). If this is\nright, it seems we need an alternative explanation of why moral\nresponsibility is absent in those cases where control of causes is\nabsent. So, for instance, if we agree that a person who offends, as an\nadult, as a result of childhood deprivation is not responsible for his\naction, we need to explain what, here, nullifies responsibility if not\nlack of control over causes of the agent’s actions. That is, we need\nto explain why certain kinds of causal background to action threaten\ncontrol while others do not even if we are dealing with cases with the\nshared feature that the agent does not control the early parts of\nthose causal backgrounds. \n\nAddressing this problem, Fischer and Ravizza suggest that a\n“process of taking responsibility is necessary for moral\nresponsibility” (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 200). They add that,\nsince processes are necessarily historical, it follows that their\naccount of responsibility attends to an action’s genesis or\norigins. With the same problem in mind, Susan Hurley suggests that\nresponsibility requires that the process “by which\nreason-responsive mechanisms and self-perceptions in relation to these\nmechanisms are acquired” (Hurley 2003, 51) is one in which the\nagent is equipped with mechanisms that are sufficiently responsive to\nobjective reasons (Hurley 2003, 51–2). That is, the reasons for which\nthe agent acts must match the reasons for action that there in fact\nare sufficiently well, although this match need not be\nperfect. Whether either of these suggestions accommodates cases where,\ninitially, responsibility seems to be undermined by lack of control of\ncauses, remains to be seen.  \n\nFor a brief discussion of the notion of constitutive luck see the\nfollowing supplementary document:\nConstitutive Luck. \n\nMost observers agree that not all bad luck is unjust.\nLuck-egalitarians, for example, often separate option luck and brute\nluck and deny that instances of differential option luck are unjust. \n\nCanonically, Ronald Dworkin explains option luck as follows:\n“Option luck is a matter of how deliberate and calculated\ngambles turn out—whether someone gains or loses through\naccepting an isolated risk he or she should have anticipated and\nmight have declined” (Dworkin 2000, 73). Brute luck is “a\nmatter of how risks fall out that are not in that sense deliberate\ngambles” (Dworkin 2000, 73). If I suddenly go blind as a result\nof a genetic condition, my brute luck is bad, but if I buy a lottery\nticket and win, my option luck is good. \n\nThe availability of insurance provides a link between brute and option\nluck. For “the decision to buy or reject […] insurance is\na calculated gamble” (Dworkin 2000, 74). This means that a\nperson may suffer bad brute luck, and for that reason end up worse off\nthan others, and yet the resulting inequality might reflect\ndifferential option luck (see, however, Otsuka 2002, 43–51).  Roughly,\nthis will be so if the person who ends up worse off could have insured\nagainst the sort of bad brute luck that she later suffered but\ndeclined to do so (Dworkin 2000, 74, 77). So although it may be bad\nbrute luck that I suddenly go blind as a result of a genetic\ncondition, the fact that I end up worse off as a result of going blind\n(if this occurs) will reflect bad option luck provided suitable\ninsurance was available to me. (This is not to say that suitable\ninsurance against the risk of becoming blind is possible. I am neither\ndenying nor affirming that no amount of money can compensate one for\nthe loss of one’s ability to see; nor am I denying, or affirming, that\nalthough some, presumably large, amount of money can compensate one\nfor becoming blind, the required insurance policy will be unreasonably\nexpensive. If suitable insurance against the risk of becoming blind is\nnot possible or possible but unreasonably expensive, it follows that\nending up worse off as a result of this is, to some extent at least, a\nmatter of bad brute luck.) \n\nDworkin’s distinction needs to be clarified, amended, and qualified in\ncertain ways (Lippert-Rasmussen 2001; Vallentyne 2002; Vallentyne\n2008; Sandbu 2004, 294–299: Otsuka 2002, 45; Steiner 2002, 349; see\nalso Dworkin 2002, 122–125). First, consider a case where I can choose\nbetween two alternatives. One involves a 75% chance of having one’s\ncrop destroyed by cold weather. The other one involves a 70% chance of\nhaving one’s crop destroyed by flooding. In one sense, obviously,\neither risk is avoidable. Yet, if one were to go for the first\nalternative, and if one’s crops were destroyed by cold weather, it\nwould seem odd to say that the full extent to which one becomes worse\noff as a result of that choice is a matter of bad option luck. After\nall, the chances of becoming just as badly off via a different causal\nroute, had I chosen the other alternative, were almost as great. So it\nseems we should often think of a given piece of luck as a mixture of\nbrute luck and option luck where the exact mixture depends on the\nextent to which one could influence the expected value of the outcome\nof one’s choice. In the present case, I could only marginally\ninfluence the expected value of the outcome. Hence the disadvantages\nresulting from my choice should be seen as mostly a matter of bad\nbrute luck. \n\nSecond, suppose I am morally required to perform a certain action,\nsay, to save someone from a burning house thereby risking some\nmoderate burns in the process. Let us also suppose that I am worse off\nthan the person I save and that my doing so happens to make me even\nworse off than this person, since I do get burned in a way that\nrequires expensive medical attention. While the extra inequality that\nresults from my doing what I am morally required to do, on Dworkin’s\ndefinition, reflects bad option luck on my part, the view that the\nresulting extra inequality is in no way unjust is implausible. In\nfact, the same conclusion would seem to apply to cases where the risk\nof severe burns is so high that one’s intervention is supererogatory\nand one ends up worse off as a result of one’s choosing to engage in a\nsupererogatory rescue mission (Eyal 2007, 4; but see Lazenby 2010; Temkin 2003(b),\n144). \n\nThird, suppose you and I face a prisoners’ dilemma. I know that there\nis some chance that you may defect in which case I will end up worse\noff. However, because I do not want to exploit you by defecting\nmyself in case you do not, I cooperate. As it happens you defect and I\nend up worse off. Again, since I am now worse off as a result of a\ncalculated gamble, I am worse off through bad option luck. Yet, it\nseems plausible to hold that the inequality that results from your\nexploiting my resistance to exploiting you is unjust\n(Lippert-Rasmussen 2011; for a different, but, related\nproblem, see Seligman 2007).  Setting aside refinements to it, in what way does Dworkin’s\ndistinction matter from the point view of justice? We can split this\nquestion into two, one concerning brute luck and one concerning option\nluck (cp. Sher 2014, 1). Most egalitarians believe that justice requires the\nnullification of all differential effects of brute luck (Cohen 2011,\n5, 29; Dworkin 2000; Rakowski 1991; for a recent critique, see Elford\n2013), feeling that it cannot be just that some people are worse off\nthan others simply because they have been unfortunate, say, to have\nbeen born with bad genes. Not all egalitarians, however, take this\nposition. Peter Vallentyne believes that while it is true that justice\nrequires compensation for congenital dispositions to develop serious\ndiseases, this is because justice requires not the neutralization of\nbad brute luck but equality of initial prospects (Vallentyne 2002,\n543). This equality obtains between two people when at some early\nstage in their development—say, the time at which they become\nsentient—their prospects are equally good. A genetic defect, at\nthis point in time, would limit one’s opportunities, and so such\ndefects will often provide grounds for compensation. However, if two\npeople face the same initial risk of developing malaria and have\nequally good initial opportunities, justice does not require us to\ncompensate the one who gets malaria as a result of bad brute luck. \n\nIt is an advantage of Vallentyne’s approach (over brute luck\nneutralizing egalitarianism) that it avoids the costs incurred in\nneutralizing the effects of differential brute luck. Of course, such\ncosts may lower everyone’s ex ante prospects. Hence, brute luck\negalitarians are committed implausibly, in such cases, to worsening\neverybody’s prospects—or, at least, to saying that it would be\nbetter to do so from the point of view of equality even if it may not\nbe better tout court. However, as Vallentyne concedes, initial\nequality of opportunity also raises problems. Suppose we live in a\ncaste society but make sure that babies are assigned starting\npositions in that society by a fair lottery. This society may well\nrealize initial equality of opportunity, yet it does not seem just\n(Barry 1989, 224n). Indeed, it is far from clear that the lottery\nreduces the injustice of this society at all. \n\nTurning now to option luck, three positions should be noted. First,\nsome believe that justice requires the differential effects of option\nluck not to be nullified. Dworkin takes this view (Dworkin 2000;\nRakowski 1991, 74; cp. Sher 2014, viii). He thinks it would be unjust\nif the state were to compensate people who suffer bad option luck by\ntaxing people who enjoy good option luck: “…people should\npay the price of the life they have decided to lead, measured in what\nothers give up in order that they can do so… But the price of a\nsafer life, measured in this way, is precisely foregoing any chance of\nthe gains whose prospect induces others to gamble” (Dworkin\n2000, 74). Crucial to this claim is the notion of the price of\none’s choices, one reason being that this might vary\nconsiderably depending on the context within which one’s choice is\nmade. \n\nOthers believe that justice permits but does not require the\nnullification of the effects of differential option luck. Peter\nVallentyne defends this position. According to him, justice requires\ninitial equality of opportunity, and this can be achieved through a\nscheme that provides equality of initial opportunities for advantage\nand no compensation for bad option outcome luck. However, initial\nequality of opportunity can also be achieved if the state, say, taxes\nall good option outcome luck (and all good brute luck) and compensates\nall bad option outcome luck (as well as all bad brute luck). This, in\neffect, will deprive people of the opportunity to gamble and hence\nensure that everyone ends up equally well off. In Vallentyne’s\nview, the latter is required by justice when, and only when, this\nincreases the value of people’s initial opportunities, and when the\nscheme is introduced publicly and proactively so that people know the\nrules of the game before it starts (Vallentyne 2002, 549, 555). The\nfirst of these conditions may be met where people are very risk averse\nand the transaction costs involved in the tax scheme are not very\ngreat. \n\nIn a third position, justice requires the nullification of some or all\neffects of differential option luck (e.g. Barry 2008). This view comes\nin several versions. In one, justice requires compensation in some but\nnot all cases of bad option luck. For instance, Marc Fleurbaey argues\nthat justice has a sufficientarian component such that it requires\ndifferential option luck outcomes where some people are left very\nbadly off to be eliminated. Suppose, for instance, that someone\ndecides to use his motorcycle without wearing a helmet, knowing the\nrisks involved, and ends up in a traffic accident in which he is\nseriously hurt as a result. According to Fleurbaey, justice requires\nus to help this person (Fleurbaey 1995, 40–41; Fleurbaey 2001, 511;\nFleurbaey 2008, 153–198; see also Segall 2007; Stemplowska 2009,\n251–254; Voigt 2007). Those attracted by Dworkin’s position on bad\noption luck will reply that we confuse an obligation of justice with\nan obligation of charity. It would be unfair for the motorcycle driver\nto impose costs on us simply because he prefers to take the gamble of\ndriving without helmet without insurance. He should pay the price of\nhis decisions (which, of course, is not to say that he deserves his\nbad fate). By contrast, friends of Vallentyne’s view might urge that\nthere is nothing unjust about a system that publicly and proactively\ndeclares that bad outcome option luck will be compensated by means of\ntaxing away good option luck. Hence, while a refusal to assist the\nunlucky motorcyclist need not be unjust, the imposition of assistance\ncosts on others, under the circumstances mentioned, would not be\nunjust either.  A more extreme egalitarianism—“all-luck\negalitarianism” to use an apt phrase coined by Shlomi Segall\n(2010, 46)—has it that “differential option luck should be\nconsidered as unjust as differential brute luck” (Segall 2010,\n47; cp. Segall 2013, 64–82).  For if what really drives egalitarians is the conviction that\npeople should not be worse off than others as a result of causes for\nwhich they are not responsible, then, arguably, it follows that\ndifferential option luck is unjust. After all, a gambler is not\nresponsible for the outcome of her gamble being what it is rather than\nsomething else it could have been.  This view does not commit its\nadvocates to the position that the state (or, for that matter, anyone\nelse) should prevent conduct that might lead to inequalities\nreflecting differential option luck: advocates of the view may care\nabout welfare too and rightly think that welfare is promoted when the\noutcomes of gambles are allowed to stand, or they might distinguish\nbetween legitimacy—“the property something has when... no\none has a just grievance against it” (Cohen 2011, 125) and\njustice and think that state intervention to eliminate differential\noption luck would be ilegitimate even if it would thereby bring about\na less unjust distribution. Again, the claim that differential option\nluck is bad is consistent with the view that, given that people do\nchoose to gamble, it is better, all things considered, if differential\noption luck is not eliminated, even if it would be better,\njustice-wise, if people had chosen not to gamble in the first place\n(Lippert-Rasmussen 2001, 576; compare Cohen 2011, 124–143;\nPersson 2006). \n\nMany passages in the luck egalitarian literature suggest that justice\nis luck-neutralization, not luck-amplification, not luck-mitigation\n(Mason 2006), and not luck-equalization. Consider, for instance,\nRawls’ remark that “Intuitively, the most obvious injustice of\nthe system of natural liberty is that it permits distributive shares\nto be improperly influenced by these factors [i.e., social\ncircumstances and such chance contingencies as accident and good\nfortune] so arbitrary from a moral point of view” (Rawls 1971,\n71). On the admittedly disputable assumption that Rawls thinks that\nfactors that are “arbitrary from a moral point of view”\nand affect people’s interests are a matter of luck, one might read\nthis passage as saying that under a just distribution, luck does not\ninfluence distributive shares (Rawls 1971, 72). As we saw in Section 2\na similar passage can be found in Cohen’s work: “anyone who\nthinks that initial advantage and inherent capacity are unjust\ndistributors thinks so because he believes that they make a person’s\nfate depend too much on sheer luck” (Cohen 1989, 932). This\npassage can be read as suggesting that the aim of neutralizing luck\njustifies equality and that realizing equality will eliminate\nluck. \n\nSuch passages can, however, be read in other ways. Thus Rawls might\nsimply mean to say that, while luck influences distributive shares\nunder a just distribution, it does not do so improperly. Likewise,\nCohen might be saying that, while people’s fates depend on luck under\na just distribution, they do not depend on sheer luck. And the fact\nthat there is room for these different readings encourages us to ask\nexactly what role luck-neutralization can play in relation to a theory\nof distributive justice. \n\nAddressing this question, Susan Hurley distinguishes between a\nspecificatory and a justificatory role for the aim of\nluck-neutralization. In the first role, the aim specifies what\negalitarianism “is and what it demands” (Hurley 2003,\n147).  In the second, it provides a justification for favoring\negalitarian over non-egalitarian theories of distributive\njustice. Hurley believes that the luck-neutralizing aim fails in both\nroles. If the aim were to play either role, it would have to be the\ncase that the favored distribution—e.g., equality, utility\nmaximization, or maximizing the position of the worst off—limits\nthe influence of luck on outcomes. However, there is no clear sense in\nwhich this is the case (compare Parfit, 1995, 12). For the sake of\nsimplicity, suppose the favored distribution is an equal one. Suppose\nalso that the inequality that we are concerned with exists between two\npeople who have each been stranded on a small island. Through sheer\ngood luck, the first person’s island is lush and fertile, and through\nsheer bad luck the other person’s island is arid. It does not follow\nfrom the fact that this unequal outcome is the result of luck that, if\nwe eliminate the inequality, the resulting equal outcome will not to\nthe same degree be the result of luck, i.e., will not be one in which\nfactors for which people are not responsible play no (or a smaller)\ncausal role in bringing about the outcome. To see this, assume we are\ndealing with thick, control-based responsibility luck and imagine that\na powerful egalitarian intervener dumps a shipload of fertilizer on\nthe second island so that equality in the Robinson Crusoe-like setting\nis realized. Since neither of the two people controlled what happened,\nthe resulting equality here is just as much a matter of luck for them\nas the prior inequality was. Since we can implement equality without\neliminating luck, this shows that we can neither justify equality as a\nmeans of neutralizing luck, nor specify what equality requires as\nneutralizing luck. The same applies to other end-result principles\n(Hurley 2003, 146–80). \n\nIn response to this important point, it might be argued that when\nluck-egalitarians write about “neutralizing luck”, this is\nreally short-hand for something like “eliminating the\ndifferential effects on people’s interests of factors which from their\nperspective are a matter of luck.” This is no different from\nsaying that affirmative action in favor of women is a way of\nneutralizing the effects of sexist discrimination. In saying this, we\ndo not imagine that affirmative action removes sexist discrimination\nand all its effects; we mean merely that the affirmative action\nprogram eliminates the differential effects on men and women of sexist\ndiscrimination (e.g., in university admissions). On this reading,\nconsiderations about luck serve, not to justify equality, but to\nselect the appropriate egalitarian view from among the large family of\nviews that ascribe intrinsic significance to equality. As Arneson puts\nit: “The argument for equal opportunity rather than straight\nequality is simply that it is morally fitting to hold individuals\nresponsible for the foreseeable consequences of their voluntary\nchoices” (Arneson 1989, 88). Equality is the default position,\nmorally speaking.  It is not justified by appeal to luck. Such an\nappeal, however, explains why some deviations from this default\nposition need not be bad from an egalitarian point of view, for in the\nrelevant deviations it is not a matter of luck that some people are\nworse off than others. In response to Hurley’s point, Cohen offers a\nrelated reply: “That it extinguishes the influence of luck is no\nmore of an argument for egalitarianism than that it promotes utility\nis an argument for utilitarianism and in each case for the same\nreason, to wit, that the cited feature is too definitive of the\nposition in question to justify the position in question” (Cohen\n2006, 441–442; see also Vallentyne 2006, 434; Hurley 2006,\n459–465). In fact, he goes on to offer something which is more radical\nthan the short-hand description of the luck-egalitarian aim offered in\nthe opening sentence of this paragraph. Since luck-egalitarians are\nopposed to luck “in the name of fairness” (compare Temkin\n2003(a), 767) and since, no less than inequality, equality is unfair\nwhen “in disaccord with choice”, equality might unjust for\nexactly the same reason as inequality might (Cohen 2006,\n444; cf. Segall 2012). Pragmatic, not principled, reasons explain why unjust equalities\ntend to not to be mentioned by luck-egalitarians. \n\nFor a further discussion of the notion of bad and good luck, see the\nfollowing supplementary document: \nBad Luck Versus Good Luck. \n\nA number of luck egalitarian accounts suggest that how much talent\npeople have is a matter of luck, whereas their levels of effort are\nnot. Metaphorically speaking, the first is a matter of the cards one\nhas been dealt, whereas the latter is a matter of how one chooses to\nplay them. To be sure, it will often be plausible to say that one’s\npresent level of talent reflects past effort, and that one’s level of\neffort is a matter of good or bad luck (Rawls 1971, 74). Partly for\nthe sake of simplicity, and partly because the problem about\nseparability will arise whichever way we make the cut between luck and\nnon-luck with regard to talents and efforts, let us initially assume\nthat while talents are wholly a matter of luck, one’s levels of effort\nare wholly a matter of non-luck.  Accordingly, people who have\ndifferent levels of talent, but the same level of effort should end up\nequally well off if we neutralize the effects of luck, whereas people\nwho have the same levels of talent but different levels of effort\nshould end unequally well off. More generally, differences in effort\nshould be reflected in differences in reward, but differences in\ntalent should not. Under these assumptions we can easily identify a\nluck-neutralizing distribution under the assumption of a constant sum\nof rewards in the following four-person case: \n\nThis distribution neutralizes luck (not necessarily uniquely: there\nmay be other luck-neutralizing distributions). Adam and Dorothy, who\ndespite different levels of talent put in the same amount of effort,\nget the same level of reward. The same is true of Beatrice and Claude.\nBeatrice and Claude’s levels of reward are higher than Adam and\nDorothy’s, reflecting their higher level of effort. \n\nAssume next that level of effort is non-separable from level of\ntalent. That is, assume that if a group of people’s levels of\ntalent had been different from what they actually are, so would their\nlevels of effort. Assume that in our four-person case above the facts\nare as follows: \n\nIt no longer is clear which distribution neutralizes luck. Two\nresponses seem possible, both of which may have unattractive\nimplications. \n\nFirst, suppose we insist that counterfactual levels of effort are\nsimply irrelevant to luck-neutralization: ex hypothesi,\none’s actual levels of effort are not a matter of luck, and a\nluck-neutralizing distribution should fit the distribution of actual\nefforts. This view may fail to capture the full range of\nluck-egalitarian intuitions. After all, Adam—if for a moment we\ndisregard problems about knowledge and indeterminacy in counterfactual\nchoices (Hurley 2001, 66–69; Hurley 2003, 164–168)—might\ncorrectly say that his case is identical to Beatrice’s, and that\nhe was merely unlucky not to be talented. And given that the cause of\ntheir putting in different levels of effort is simply a matter of\nluck, how can Beatrice’s higher level of effort justify a higher level\nof reward for her? In not being talented, Adam may have suffered from\nbad circumstantial luck. That is to say, the circumstances in which he\ndecided on his levels of effort—his particular skills not being\nmuch in demand—may have ensured that those decisions were less\nprudent than they would have been in different\ncontexts. Alternatively, Adam may have suffered from bad constitutive\nluck in that he could have been differently constituted, and had he\nbeen so he would have made greater effort. \n\nSecond, we might say that actual as well as counterfactual levels of\neffort matter (compare Zimmerman 1993, 226). Rewards should match\naverage effort across different possible worlds. Since Claude’s\nlevels of effort are high whatever his level of talent,\nDorothy’s are low whatever her level of talent, and Adam’s and\nBeatrice’s levels of effort varies with their level of talent, a\nluck-neutralizing distribution would leave Claude best off, Adam and\nBeatrice second-best off, and Dorothy worst off. The problem now is\nthat people who actually make the same efforts, i.e., Adam and Dorothy\nand Beatrice and Claude, are rewarded differently. Beatrice might\ncomplain that her level of effort is as high as Claude’s, and\nyet he gets rewarded more—and he does so, moreover, not solely\nas a consequence of how he actually conducted himself, but partly as a\nresult of how he would have conducted himself had his level of talent\nbeen different from what it in fact is. When we focus on thick,\nresponsibility control luck or thick, responsibility choice luck, it\nbecomes unclear whether this is the right way to neutralize luck. For,\non many accounts of responsibility, what I am responsible for depends\non properties of the actual sequence of events and not on what I would\nhave done in some counterfactual sequence of events in which my\npersonality differs from the way it actually is. It appears that, to\nreconcile such thick accounts of luck with neutralizing luck on the\nbasis of counterfactual levels of effort, we would need to endorse a\nregressive conception of responsibility on which to be responsible for\nsomething one has to be responsible for its causes. This would solve\nthe problem of accounting for which distribution neutralizes luck in\nthat, as argued above, it now seems that the only distribution that\nneutralizes luck is an equal one. However, it would also prevent\nluck-egalitarians from claiming that people with different levels of\ntalent should be rewarded differently. Hence, while the\nnon-separability of talent and effort does not refute\nluck-egalitarianism, two ways of resolving the issues it raises\ngenerate further problems. \n\nMost egalitarians want to compensate people for bad brute luck but not\nfor bad option luck. Moreover, they have tended to assume that this is\nessentially what justice is about. Recently, this attitude has been\ncriticized as either leaving out of the picture an important\nnon-distributive egalitarian concern, to wit, an egalitarian concern\nfor the nature of social relations, or, more radically, as being a\ncomplete misconstrual of egalitarian justice (Anderson 1999; Anderson\n2010; Anderson 2012; Scanlon 2018; Scheffler 2003; Scheffler 2005; for\nan overview see Fourie et. al. (eds.) 2015). \n\nJonathan Wolff defends the moderate position that while distributive\nconcerns about bad brute luck are part of what justice is about, that\nis not the whole story: “Distributive justice should be limited\nin its application by other egalitarian concerns” (Wolff 1998,\n122; cp. Scheffler 2015), for the ideal of justice also includes the\nview that we should respect one another as equals. According to Wolff,\nthis introduces a reason not to strive for perfect equality of\nopportunity. For making people equally well off in terms of\nopportunity would require “shameful revelations” on the\npart of people who must, for instance, pass on to others (and thus\nthemselves come to terms with) the information that they have no\ntalent (for a discussion, see Elford 2017; Hinton 2001; Lang 2009,\n329–338; Wolff 2010). \n\nWolff’s point is well made, but luck-egalitarians may be able to\naccommodate it. First, insofar as they accept Wolff’s factual\nobservation, they may think that this points to a strong (welfarist)\nluck-egalitarian reason not to implement equality of opportunity: we\ncan know in advance that collecting the relevant information is likely\nto make some of those who are already worse off through bad luck even\nworse off. Of course, this would not show that if we could\ncollect the relevant information without bad side effects, we should\nnot aim to compensate bad brute luck alone. Additionally,\nluck-egalitarians may simply concede that the pursuit of the\nluck-egalitarian ideal is constrained by, or otherwise balanced\nagainst the pursuit of, other ideals, including that of equal\nrespect. In any case, luck-egalitarians are unlikely to claim that\nluck-neutralization is the only ideal, as that would imply that a\nworld where everyone lives miserable lives is better, all things\nconsidered, than a world where half the people live tremendous lives\nand the other half live even better lives. \n\nLike Wolff, Elizabeth Anderson argues that egalitarians believe people\nshould live in communities based on principles that “express\nequal respect and concern for all citizens” (Anderson 1999,\n289; compare Scheffler 2003, 22,31). Unlike Wolff, however, Anderson\nmakes the more radical claim that (true) egalitarians have, in a way,\nno non-instrumental concern about distribution at all: they are\nconcerned about distribution only indirectly, their direct concern\nbeing that members of the community should stand as equals (compare\nScheffler 2003, 22; Anderson 2010). No doubt, to achieve this, large scale\negalitarian redistribution of income, wealth, etc., might be required, but the\nelimination of differential brute luck per se is not.  What is\nrequired is the ability of all to function as equal human beings in\ncivil society and in political decision making.  Luck-egalitarians, inter alia, question whether this picture is\ncorrect (Barry 2006; Knight 2005; Gheaus 2018; Knight 2009,\n122–166; Navin 2011; Tan 2008; Miklosi 2018; but see Kaufman\n2004). First, they might dispute the very way in which Anderson\ndescribes the disagreement. They might do so because they think social\nstanding can be seen as a good, which, setting aside considerations\nabout responsibility, should be distributed equally from a luck\negalitarian point of view (Lippert-Rasmussen 2015a,b;\nLippert-Rasmussen forthcoming). If so, luck egalitarianism might be\nable to accommodate many of Anderson’s concerns. Or they might think\nthat (most) luck egalitarians and critics like Anderson simply address\ndifferent questions. The former ask what constitutes a fair\ndistribution, whereas the latter asks what we owe one another\n(Vallentyne 2015). These are different (though possibly related)\nquestions, because, arguably, distributions might be unfair even if no\none has failed to do what they owe others, say, if some die young and\nothers die old, and there is nothing anyone could do to prevent this\nfrom being so (cp. Lippert-Rasmussen 2018, forthcoming; Moles and Parr\nforthcoming). Second, suppose resources are distributed in such a way\nthat equal functioning in civil society and in political decision\nmaking is assured. Suppose, moreover, that we can choose between two\ndistributions: one that benefits those who are worse off in terms of\nhow well their lives go, and another that benefits those who are best\noff in terms of how well their lives go.  Since this choice will not\naffect democratic equality, these options are equally good on\nAnderson’s account. To many, this is an unattractive implication of\nher view. Of course, if the threshold of equal functioning is very\nhigh the problem becomes less serious.  However, with high thresholds\na different problem becomes more serious.  For if people should be\nassured of equal functioning at a very high level irrespective of\nwhether they act (perhaps repeatedly) in irresponsibly foolish ways,\nit will not seem fair to impose the cost of their choices on\nothers—i.e., the cost of bringing them up to the appropriate\nthreshold of equal functioning (Arneson 2000, 347–348; for a\nreply, see Anderson (Other Internet Resources, 2(e)).  Intuitively,\nthen, the complaint is that democratic equality ascribes no\nsignificance to the fact that responsibility can negate luck. It is\nfar from clear that concern about equal status overturns the pivotal\nbelief that justice is concerned with compensation for bad luck (see,\nhowever, Scheffler 2003; Scheffler 2005; Scheffler 2015). Indeed, the\npresent line of thought suggests that luck-ist versions of the\nrelational ideal might be more plausible than non-luckist\nversions. While much of the relational egalitarian critique of luck\negalitarianism has focused on the weight it gives to considerations\nconcerning luck, the issue of how this question is resolved is a\ndifferent issue from the issue of whether justice concerns\ndistributions or relations (or both). This is reflected in the fact\nthat two possible views are outcome egalitarianism and luckist\nversions of relational egalitarianism, according to which to relate as\nequals the way in which we treat one another must reflect differential\nchoice, responsibility etc. On the latter view I might not relate to\nothers as equals if I expect them to bear the costs of my\nirresponsible choices.","contact.mail":"lippert@ps.au.dk","contact.domain":"ps.au.dk"}]
