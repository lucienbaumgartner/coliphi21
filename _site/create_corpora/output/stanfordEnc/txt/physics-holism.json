One puzzling quantum phenomenon arises\nwhen one performs measurements on certain separated quantum\nsystems. The results of some such measurements regularly exhibit\npatterns of statistical correlation that resist traditional causal\nexplanation. Some have held that it is possible to understand these\npatterns as instances or consequences of quantum holism or\nnonseparability. Just what holism and nonseparability are supposed to\nbe has not always been made clear, though, and each of these notions\nhas been understood in different ways. Moreover, while some have taken\nholism and nonseparability to come to the same thing, others have\nthought it important to distinguish the two. Any evaluation of the\nsignificance of quantum holism and/or nonseparability must rest on a\ncareful analysis of these notions and their physical applications.\n\n\n\nHolism has often been taken as the thesis that the whole is more than\nthe sum of its parts. Several different interpretations of this\nepigram prove relevant to physics, as we shall see. Here is a\ncorrespondingly vague initial statement of nonseparability: The state\nof the whole is not constituted by states of its parts. It is already\napparent both that holism and nonseparability are related notions and\nthat their exact relation needs to be clarified. \n\nIn one interpretation, holism is a methodological thesis\n (Section 2),\n to the effect that the best way to study the behavior of a complex\nsystem is to treat it as a whole, and not merely to analyze the\nstructure and behavior of its component parts. Alternatively, holism\nmay be taken as a metaphysical thesis\n (Section 3):\n There are some wholes whose natures are simply not determined by the\nnature of their parts. Methodological holism stands opposed to\nmethodological reductionism, in physics as well as in other\nsciences. But it is a certain variety of metaphysical holism that is\nmore closely related to nonseparability. What is at issue here is the\nextent to which the properties of the whole are determined by the\nproperties of its parts: property holism\n (Section 4)\n denies such determination, and thereby comes very close to a thesis\nof nonseparability. In turn, nonseparability can be analyzed either as\nstate nonseparability\n (Section 5),\n or as spatiotemporal nonseparability\n (Section 6).\n By and large, a system in classical physics can be analyzed into\nparts, whose states and properties determine those of the whole they\ncompose\n (Section 7).\n But the state of a system in quantum theory resists such\nanalysis. The quantum state of a system specifies its\nchances of exhibiting various properties on\nmeasurement. In ordinary quantum mechanics, the most complete such specification is\ngiven by what is called a pure state. Even when a compound system has\na pure state, some of its subsystems may not have their own pure\nstates. Emphasizing this characteristic of quantum mechanics,\nSchrödinger described such component states as “entangled”\n (Section 8).\n Superficially, such entanglement of states already demonstrates\nnonseparability. At a deeper level, it has been maintained that the\npuzzling statistics that arise from measurements on entangled quantum\nsystems either demonstrate, or are explicable in terms of, holism or\nnonseparability rather than any problematic action at a distance\n (Sections 8,\n 9).\n The Aharonov-Bohm effect\n (Section 10)\n also appears to exhibit action at a distance, as the behavior of\nelectrons is modified by a magnetic field they never experience. But\nthis effect may be understood instead as a result of the local action\nof nonseparable electromagnetism. Puzzling correlations arise between\ndistant simultaneous measurements even in the vacuum, according to\nquantum field theory\n (Section 12).\nA form of quantum theory used to study them represents systems by\nalgebras of operators with new kinds of states defined on them,\nthereby making room for failures of state and system separability with\nno analogs in ordinary quantum mechanics. String theory\n(Section 13) is an ambitious research program in\nthe framework of quantum field theory. According to string theory, all\nfundamental particles can be considered to be excitations of\nunderlying non-pointlike entities in a multi-dimensional space. The\nparticles’ intrinsic charge, mass and spin may then arise as\nnonseparable features of the world at the deepest level. \n\nMethodologically, holism stands opposed to reductionism, somewhat as\nfollows. \n\nThis seems to capture much of what is at stake in debates about holism\nin social and biological science. In social science, societies are the\ncomplex systems, composed of individuals; while in biology, the\ncomplex systems are organisms, composed of cells, and ultimately of\nproteins, DNA and other molecules. A methodological individualist\nmaintains that the right way to approach the study of a society is to\ninvestigate the behavior of the individual people that compose it. A\nmethodological holist, on the other hand, believes that such an\ninvestigation will fail to shed much light on the nature and\ndevelopment of society as a whole. There is a corresponding debate\nwithin physics. Methodological reductionists favor an approach to\n(say) condensed matter physics which seeks to understand the behavior\nof a solid or liquid by applying quantum mechanics (say) to its\ncomponent molecules, atoms, ions or electrons. Methodological holists\nthink this approach is misguided: As one condensed matter physicist\nput it “the most important advances in this area come about by the\nemergence of qualitatively new concepts at the intermediate or\nmacroscopic levels—concepts which, one hopes, will be\ncompatible with one’s information about the microscopic constituents,\nbut which are in no sense logically dependent on it.” (Leggett 1987,\np.113) \n\nIt is surprisingly difficult to find methodological reductionists\namong physicists. The elementary particle physicist Steven Weinberg,\nfor example, is an avowed reductionist. He believes that by asking any\nsequence of deeper and deeper why-questions one will arrive ultimately\nat the same fundamental laws of physics. But this explanatory\nreductionism is metaphysical in so far as he takes explanation to be\nan ontic rather than a pragmatic category. On this view, it is not\nphysicists but the fundamental laws themselves that explain why\n“higher level” scientific principles are the way they are. Weinberg\n(1992) explicitly distinguishes his view from methodological\nreductionism by saying that there is no reason to suppose that the\nconvergence of scientific explanations must lead to a convergence of\nscientific methods. \n\nThe metaphysical holist believes that the nature of some wholes is not\ndetermined by that of their parts. One may distinguish three varieties\nof metaphysical holism: ontological, property and nomological\nholism. \n\nAll three theses require an adequate clarification of the notion of a\n basic physical part.\n One way to do this would be to consider objects as basic, relative to\na given class of objects subjected only to a certain kind of process,\njust in case every object in that class continues to be wholly\ncomposed of a fixed set of these (basic) objects. Thus, atoms would\ncount as basic parts of hydrogen if it is burnt to form water, but not\nif it is converted into helium by a thermonuclear reaction. But this\nway excludes consideration of time-slices and point events (for\nexample) as basic (spatio)temporal parts of an object. What counts as\na part, and what parts are basic, are matters best settled in a\nparticular context of enquiry. \n\nWeinberg’s (1992) reductionism is opposed to nomological holism in\nscience. He claims, in particular, that thermodynamics has been\nexplained in terms of particles and forces, which could hardly be the\ncase if thermodynamic laws were autonomous. In fact thermodynamics\npresents a fascinating but complex test case for the theses both of\nproperty holism and of nomological holism. One source of complexity is\nthe variety of distinct concepts of both temperature and entropy that\nfigure in both classical thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\nAnother is the large number of quite differently constituted systems\nto which thermodynamics can be applied, including not just gases and\nelectromagnetic radiation but also magnets, chemical reactions, star\nclusters and black holes. Both sources of complexity require a careful\nexamination of the extent to which thermodynamic properties are\ndetermined by the physical properties of the basic parts of\nthermodynamic systems. A third difficulty stems from the problematic\nstatus of the probability assumptions that are required in addition to\nthe basic mechanical laws in order to recover thermodynamic principles\nwithin statistical mechanics. (An important example is the assumption\nthat the micro-canonical ensemble is to be assigned the standard,\ninvariant, probability distribution.) Since the basic laws of\nmechanics do not determine the principles of thermodynamics without\nsome such assumptions (however weak), there may well be at least one\ninteresting sense in which thermodynamics establishes nomological\nholism. The related entry\n philosophy of statistical mechanics\n contains further discussion of these difficulties, especially in\nSection 6. \n\nWhile some form of\n ontological holism\n has occasionally been considered, the variety of metaphysical holism\nmost clearly at issue in quantum mechanics is property holism. But to\nsee just what the issue is we need a more careful formulation of that\nthesis. \n\nFirst the thesis should be contextualized to physical\nproperties of composite physical objects. We are interested\nhere in how far a physical object’s properties are fixed by those of\nits parts, not in some more general determinationist\nphysicalism. Next, to arrive at an interesting formulation of property\nholism we must accept that this thesis is not only concerned with\nproperties, and not concerned with all properties. The properties of a\nwhole will typically depend upon relations among its proper\nparts as well as on properties of the individual parts. But if we are\npermitted to consider all properties and relations among the\nparts, then these trivially determine the properties of the whole they\ncompose. For one relation among the parts is what we might call the\ncomplete composition relation—that relation among the parts\nwhich holds just in case they compose this very whole with all its\nproperties. \n\nLet us call a canonical set of properties and relations of the parts\nwhich may or may not determine the properties and relations of the\nwhole the supervenience basis. To avoid trivializing the theses we are\ntrying to formulate, only certain properties and relations can be\nallowed in the supervenience basis. The intuition as to which these\nare is simple—the supervenience basis is to include just the\nqualitative intrinsic properties and relations of the parts, i.e., the\nproperties and relations which these bear in and of themselves,\nwithout regard to any other objects, and irrespective of any further\nconsequences of their bearing these properties for the properties of\nany wholes they might compose. Unfortunately, this simple intuition\nresists precise formulation. It is notoriously difficult to say\nprecisely what is meant either by an\n intrinsic property\n or relation, or by a purely qualitative property or relation. And the\nother notions appealed to in expressing the simple intuition are\nhardly less problematic. But, imprecise as it is, this statement\nserves already to exclude certain unwanted properties and relations,\nincluding the complete composition relation, from the supervenience\nbasis. \n\nFinally, we arrive at the following opposing theses: \n\nIf we take the real state of a set of physical objects to be given by\ntheir qualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations, then\nphysical property determination says (while physical property holism\ndenies) that the real state of wholes is determined by the real state\nof their parts. \n\nThere is some residual unclarity in the notion of supervenience that\nfigures in these theses. The idea is familiar enough—that\nthere can be no relevant difference in objects in \\(D\\) without a\nrelevant difference in their basic physical parts. I take it that the\nmodality involved here is not logical but broadly physical. One might\ntry to explicate the notion of supervenience here in terms of models\nof a true, descriptively complete, physical theory. At issue is\nwhether such a physical theory has two models which agree on the\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations of the basic\nparts of one or more objects in \\(D\\) but disagree on some\nqualitative intrinsic property or relation of these objects. \n\nTeller (1989) has introduced the related idea of what he calls\nrelational holism. \n\nWithin physics, this specializes to a close relative of physical\nproperty holism, namely: \n\nPhysical property holism entails physical relational holism, but not\nvice versa. For suppose that \\(F\\) is some qualitative intrinsic\nphysical property or relation of one or more elements of \\(D\\)\nthat fails to supervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties\nand relations in the supervenience basis of their basic physical\nparts. We may define a (non-intrinsic) physical relation\n\\(R_{F}\\) to hold of the basic physical parts of elements\nof \\(D\\) if and only if \\(F\\) holds of these elements.\nClearly \\(R_{F}\\) does not supervene on the qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties of these parts. So physical property\nholism entails physical relational holism. But the converse entailment\nfails. For let \\(R_{G}\\) be a physical relation that\nholds between the basic parts of some elements in \\(D\\) when and\nonly when those elements are in the relation \\(S_{G}\\).\n\\(R_{G}\\) may fail to supervene on the qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties of these basic parts, even though all\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations of elements of\n\\(D\\) (including \\(S_{G}\\)) supervene on the\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties and relations of\ntheir basic parts. \n\nPhysical relational holism seems at first sight too weak to capture\nany distinctive feature of quantum phenomena: even in classical\nphysics the spatiotemporal relations between physical objects seem not\nto supervene on their qualitative intrinsic physical properties. But\nwhen he introduced relational holism Teller (1987) maintained a view of\nspacetime as a quantity: On this view spatiotemporal relations do in\nfact supervene on qualitative intrinsic physical properties of\nordinary physical objects, since these include their spatiotemporal\nproperties. \n\nPhysics treats systems by assigning them states. The thermodynamic\nstate of a gas specifies its pressure, volume and temperature. The\nstate of a system of classical particles is represented as a point in\na phase space coordinatized by their positions and momenta. One\nexpects that if a physical system is composed of physical subsystems,\nthen both the composite system and its subsystems will be assigned\nstates by the relevant physical theory. One further expects that the\nstate of the whole will not be independent of those of its parts, and\nspecifically that if a system is composed of two subsystems,\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then it will satisfy a principle formulated\nby Einstein (1935). Howard (1985, p.180) gives the following\ntranslation of this principle, which I’ll call the \n\nBut the assignment of states to systems in quantum mechanics seems\nnot to conform to these expectations (see related entry\n quantum mechanics).\n Recall that the quantum state of a system specifies its chances of\nexhibiting various properties on measurement. At least in ordinary\nquantum mechanics, the mathematical representative of this state is an\nobject defined in a Hilbert space—a kind of vector space. This\nis analogous in some ways to the representation of the state of a\nsystem of particles in classical mechanics in a phase space. Let us\nformulate a principle of \n\nThis principle could fail in one of two ways: the subsystems may\nsimply not be assigned any states of their own, or else the states\nthey are assigned may fail to determine the state of the system they\ncompose. Interestingly, state assignments in quantum mechanics have\nbeen taken to violate state separability in both ways. \n\nThe quantum state of a system may be either pure or mixed (see related\nentry\n quantum mechanics).\nIn ordinary quantum mechanics a pure state is represented by a vector\nin the system’s Hilbert space. On one common understanding, any\n entangled quantum systems\nviolate state separability in so far as a vector representing the\nstate of the system they compose does not factorize into a product of\nvectors, one in the Hilbert space of each individual subsystem, that\ncould be taken to represent their pure states. On the other hand, in\nsuch a case each subsystem may be uniquely assigned what is called a\nmixed state represented in its Hilbert space not by a vector but by a\nmore general object—a so-called von Neumann density\noperator. But then state separability fails for a different reason:\nthe subsystem mixed states do not uniquely determine the compound\nsystem’s state. A failure of state separability may not occasion much\nsurprise if states are thought of merely in their role of specifying a\nsystem’s chances of exhibiting various possible properties on\nmeasurement. But it becomes more puzzling if one believes that a\nsystem’s quantum state also has a role in specifying some or all of\nits categorical properties. For that role may connect a failure of\nstate separability to metaphysical holism and nonseparability. \n\nThe idea is familiar (particularly to Lego enthusiasts!) that if one\nconstructs a physical object by assembling its physical parts, then\nthe physical properties of that object are wholly determined by the\nproperties of the parts and the way it is put together from them. A\nprinciple of spatial separability tries to capture that idea. \n\nIf we identify the real state of a system with its qualitative\nintrinsic physical properties, then spatial separability is related to\na separability principle stated by Howard (1985, p. 173) to the effect\nthat any two spatially separated systems possess their own separate\nreal states. It is even more closely related to Einstein’s (1935)\n real state separability principle.\n Indeed, Einstein formulated this principle in the context of a pair\n\\(A, B\\) of spatially separated systems. \n\n Spatial nonseparability\n—the denial of spatial separability—is also closely\nrelated to\n physical property holism.\nAt least classically, spatial relations are the only clear examples\nof qualitative intrinsic physical relations required in the\nsupervenience basis for physical property determination/holism: other\nintrinsic physical relations seem to supervene on them, while any\ninstance of physical property holism due to the spatial separation of\nbasic physical parts would entail spatial nonseparability. But if one\nthought a spatially localized object has a determinate value for a\nmagnitude like mass only by virtue of its mass relations to other such\nobjects elsewhere then one might decide to include those relations in\nthe supervenience basis also (see Dasgupta (2013)). \n\nIf we take a spacetime perspective, then spatial separability\nnaturally generalizes to \n\nSpatiotemporal separability is a natural restriction to physics of\nDavid Lewis’s (1986, p. x) principle of Humean supervenience. It is\nalso closely related to another principle formulated by Einstein\n(1948, pp. 233–234 of Howard’s (1989) translation) in the following\nwords: “An essential aspect of [the] arrangement of things in physics\nis that they lay claim, at a certain time, to an existence independent\nof one another, provided these objects ‘are situated in\ndifferent parts of space’” (the context of the quote\nsuggests that Einstein intended his principle to apply to objects\nprovided they then occupy spacelike separated regions of\nspacetime). \n\nAs Healey (1991, p. 411) shows, spatiotemporal separability entails\nspatial separability, and so spatial nonseparability entails\nspatiotemporal nonseparability. Because it is both more general and\nmore consonant with a geometric spacetime viewpoint, it seems\nreasonable to consider spatiotemporal separability to be the primary\nnotion. Accordingly, separability without further qualification will\nmean spatiotemporal separability in what follows, and nonseparability\nwill be understood as its denial. \n\nIt is important to note that nonseparability entails neither\n physical property holism\n nor\n spatial nonseparability:\n a process may be nonseparable even though it involves objects without\nproper parts. But this section has explained that either of the latter\nprinciples entails nonseparability under quite weak assumptions. \n\nClassical physics presents no definitive examples of either\n physical property holism\n or\n nonseparability.\n As section 6 explained, almost any instance of physical property\nholism would demonstrate nonseparability. This justifies restricting\nattention to the latter notion. Now the assumption that all physical\nprocesses are completely described by a local assignment of magnitudes\nforms part of the metaphysical background to classical physics. In\nNewtonian spacetime, the kinematical behavior of a system of point\nparticles under the action of finite forces is supervenient upon\nascriptions of particular values of position and momentum to the\nparticles along their trajectories. This\nsupervenience on local magnitudes extends also to dynamics if the\nforces on the particles arise from fields defined at each spacetime\npoint. \n\nThe boiling of a kettle of water is an example of a more complex\nphysical process. It consists in the increased kinetic energy of its\nconstituent molecules permitting each to overcome the short range\nattractive forces which otherwise hold it in the liquid. It thus\nsupervenes on the assignment, at each spacetime point on the\ntrajectory of each molecule, of physical magnitudes to that molecule\n(such as its kinetic energy), as well as to the fields that give rise\nto the attractive force acting on the molecule at that point. \n\nAs an example of a process in Minkowski spacetime (the spacetime\nframework for Einstein’s special theory of relativity), consider the\npropagation of an electromagnetic wave through empty space. This is\nsupervenient upon an ascription of the electromagnetic field tensor at\neach point in the spacetime. \n\nBut it does not follow that classical processes like these are\nseparable. For one may question whether an assignment of basic\nmagnitudes at spacetime points amounts to or results from an\nassignment of qualitative intrinsic properties at those points. Take\ninstantaneous velocity, for example: this is usually defined as the\nlimit of average velocities over successively smaller temporal\nneighborhoods of that point. This provides a reason to deny that the\ninstantaneous velocity of a particle at a point supervenes on\nqualitative intrinsic properties assigned at that point. Similar\nskeptical doubts can be raised about the intrinsic character of other\n“local” magnitudes such as the density of a fluid, the value of an\nelectromagnetic field, or the metric and curvature of spacetime (see\nButterfield (2006)). \n\nOne response to such doubts is to admit to a minor consequent\nviolation of separability while introducing a weaker notion,\nnamely \n\nAlong with a correspondingly strengthened notion of \n\nNo holism need be involved in a process that is nonseparable, but not\nstrongly so, as long as the basic parts of the objects involved in it\nare themselves taken to be associated with arbitrarily small\nneighborhoods rather than points. \n\nAny physical process fully described by a local spacetime theory will\nbe at least weakly separable. For such a theory proceeds by assigning\ngeometric objects (such as vectors or tensors) at each point in\nspacetime to represent physical fields, and then requiring that these\nsatisfy certain field equations. But processes fully described by\ntheories of other forms will also be separable. These include many\ntheories which assign magnitudes to particles at each point on their\ntrajectories. Of familiar classical theories, it is only theories\ninvolving direct action between spatially separated particles which\ninvolve nonseparability in their description of the dynamical\nhistories of individual particles. But such processes are weakly\nseparable within spacetime regions that are large enough to include\nall sources of forces acting on these particles, so that the\nappearance of strong nonseparability may be attributed to a mistakenly\nnarrow understanding of the spacetime region these processes actually\noccupy. \n\nThe propagation of gravitational energy according to general\nrelativity apparently involves strongly nonseparable processes, since\ngravitational energy cannot be localized (it does not contribute to\nthe stress-energy tensor defined at each point of spacetime as do\nother forms of energy). But even a non-locally-defined gravitational\nenergy will still be supervenient upon the metric tensor defined at\neach point of the spacetime, and so the process of its propagation\nwill be weakly separable. \n\nThe definition of nonseparability becomes problematic in general\nrelativity, since its application requires that one identify the same\nregion \\(R\\) in possible spacetimes with different\ngeometries. But while there is no generally applicable algorithm for\nmaking a uniquely appropriate identification, some identification may\nappear salient in a particular case. For example, one can meaningfully\ndiscuss whether or not the field is the same everywhere in the region\noutside the solenoid in the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect\n with an increased current flowing, even though the size of the\ncurrent will have a (tiny) influence on the geometry of that\nregion. Note that the definition of nonseparability does not require\nthat one identify the same point in spacetimes of distinct\ngeometries. \n\nWhile strictly outside the domain of classical physics, quantum\nphenomena such as the\n Aharonov-Bohm effect \nmay be considered manifestations of nonseparability and\nholism even in classical electromagnetism. Nonseparability\nwould be a trivial notion if no qualitative intrinsic physical\nproperties were ever assigned at spacetime points or in their\nneighborhoods. But this would require a thorough-going relationism\nthat took not just geometric but all local features to be irreducibly\nrelational (cf. Esfeld (2004)). \n\nQuantum entanglement is in the first instance a relation between not\nphysical but mathematical objects representing the states of quantum\nsystems. Different forms of quantum theory represent quantum states of\nvarious systems by different kinds of mathematical object. So the\nconcept of quantum entanglement has been expressed by a family of\ndefinitions, each appropriate to a specific form and application of\nquantum theory (see Earman (2015)). The first definition\n(Schrödinger (1935)) was developed in the context of applications\nof ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to pairs of\ndistinguishable particles that have interacted, such as an electron\nand proton. \nA hydrogen atom may be represented in ordinary non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics as a quantum system composed of two subsystems: an\nelectron \\(e\\) and a nuclear proton \\(p\\). When isolated,\nits quantum state may be represented by a vector \\(\\Psi\\) in a\nspace \\(H\\) constructed as a tensor product of\nspaces \\(H_{p}\\) and \\(H_{e}\\) used to\nrepresent states of \\(e, p\\) respectively. The states\nof \\(e, p\\) are then defined as entangled if and only if\n \n \nfor every pair of vectors \\(\\Psi_{p}, \\Psi_{e}\\) in\n\\(H_{p}\\), \\(H_{e}\\) respectively. This definition naturally\ngeneralizes to systems composed of \\(n\\) distinguishable\nparticles. But alternative definitions seem preferable for a\ncollection of indistinguishable particles—of electrons or of\nphotons for example (see Ghirardi et al. (2002),\nLadyman et al. (2013)). \nIt follows that the states of electron and proton in an isolated\nhydrogen atom are entangled. But one may also represent the hydrogen\natom as composed of a center-of-mass subsystem \\(C\\) and a relative\nsubsystem \\(R\\) represented by vector states \\(\\Psi_{C}\\),\n\\(\\Psi_{R}\\) in \\(H_{C}, H_{R}\\) respectively such that\n \n \nIf the state of the hydrogen atom is represented by \\(\\Psi\\) then the\nstates of quantum subsystems \\(C, R\\) are not entangled but the states\nof quantum subsystems \\(p, e\\) are entangled. This illustrates the\nimportant point that one cannot draw metaphysical conclusions from a\nmathematical condition of quantum entanglement without first deciding\nwhich quantum systems are physical parts composing some physical\nwhole. It may seem natural to take the physical parts of a hydrogen\natom to be an electron and a proton. But note that the state of an\nisolated hydrogen atom is usually represented by \\(\\Psi_{R}\\), and not\nby \\(\\Psi\\) or \\(\\Psi_{e}\\). \nViewed as basic physical parts of a hydrogen atom represented by state\n\\(\\Psi\\), its electron and proton may be considered entangled physical\nparts since \\(\\Psi\\) cannot be expressed as a product of vectors\nrepresenting the state of each. The electron and the proton may each\nbe assigned a mixed state, but these do not uniquely determine the\nstate \\(\\Psi\\): state separability is violated. This may occasion no\nsurprise if a system’s state merely specifies its chances of\nexhibiting various possible properties on measurement. But it may have\nmetaphysical significance if a system’s quantum state plays a role in\nspecifying its categorical properties—its real state, so that\nthe real state separability principle is\nthreatened. His commitment to this principle is one reason why\nEinstein denied that a physical system’s real state is given by its\nquantum state (though it’s not clear what he thought its real state\nconsisted in). But according to (one variant of) the rival Copenhagen\ninterpretation, the quantum state gives a physical system’s real\ndynamical state by specifying that it contains just those qualitative\nintrinsic quantum dynamical properties to which it assigns probability\n1. On this last interpretation, violation of state separability in\nquantum mechanics leads to\n physical property holism:\n it implies, for example, that a pair of fundamental particles may\nhave the intrinsic property of being spinless even though this is not\ndetermined by the intrinsic properties and relations of its component\nparticles. \n\nIf an entangled pure vector state of a pair of quantum systems\nviolates state separability then there are measurements of dynamical\nvariables (one on each subsystem) whose joint quantum probability\ndistribution cannot be expressed as a product of probability\ndistributions for separate measurements of each variable. Quantum\ntheory predicts such a probability distribution for each of many types\nof spatially separated measurements of variables including spin and\npolarization components on a pair of entangled physical entities\nassigned such a state, and many of these distributions have been\nexperimentally verified. If one thought that quantum theory treats\neach dynamical variable by replacing a precise real value assignment\nby a probability distribution for the results of measurements of that\ndynamical variable, one might take this already to violate the real\nstate separability principle. But if one entertains a theory that\nsupplements the quantum state by values of additional\n“hidden” variables, then the quantum probabilities would\nbe taken to arise from averaging over many distinct hidden states. In\nthat case, it would rather be the probability distribution conditional\non a complete specification of the values of the hidden variables that\nshould be taken to specify the underlying chances of system and\nsubsystems exhibiting various possible properties on measurement. The\nreal state might then include all these conditional probability\ndistributions. The best known example of such a theory is the Bohm\ntheory (see the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics),\nwhere the “hidden” variables are spatial positions. In\neach specific experimental context all conditional probabilities are 0\nor 1, so the joint conditional probability distributions indeed\nfactorize. But the outcome of a measurement of a chosen dynamical\nvariable on one subsystem depends on what dynamical variable is chosen\nand measured on the other, no matter just when or how far apart these\nmeasurements are selected and made. \nBell (1964, [2004]) reasoned that any local hidden variable\ntheory must yield conditional probabilities of 0 or 1 for each local\noutcome in order to reproduce all quantum predictions but could not\npermit these to depend on the choice of distant measurement. He then\nproved that the probabilistic predictions of any local hidden variable\ntheory must satisfy particular inequalities violated by predictions of\nquantum theory for certain entangled state assignments (see\nentry Bell’s Theorem). In later work\nBell (1990, [2004]) generalized this argument to apply to any theory\nof a certain type meeting a condition he called Local Causality which,\nhe claimed, quantum mechanics does not meet. Howard (1989, 1992) took\noutcome independence — the probabilistic independence of the\noutcomes of a given pair of measurements, one on each of a pair of\nentangled systems, conditional on definite values for any assumed\nhidden variables on the joint system—as a separability\ncondition. Outcome independence may be contrasted with parameter\nindependence—the condition that, given a definite hidden\nvariable assignment, the outcome of a measurement on one of a pair of\nentangled systems is probabilistically independent of what\nmeasurement, if any, is made on the other system. Together with\nparameter independence, outcome independence implies the factorization\nof conditional probabilities that leads to what are now called Bell\ninequalities. These inequalities constrain the patterns of statistical\ncorrelations to be expected between the results of measurements of\nvariables such as spin and polarization on a pair of entangled systems\nin any quantum state. Quantum mechanics predicts, and experiment\nconfirms, that such Bell inequalities do not always hold. The Bohm\ntheory accommodates this fact by its violation of parameter\ndependence, and hence Local Causality. But Howard (1989), as well as\nTeller (1989), suggested that we appeal instead to a failure of\noutcome independence to understand why Bell inequalities do not always\nhold, and that this failure is associated rather with holism or\nnonseparability. Howard (1989) blamed the violation of Bell\ninequalities on the violation of his separability condition: Teller\n(1989) took it to be a manifestation of\n relational holism.\n They both acquit parameter independence of blame because they believe\nthat (at least when the measurement events on the entangled systems\nare spacelike separated) parameter independence (unlike outcome\nindependence) is a consequence of relativity theory: (note that the\nBohm theory requires a preferred frame not provided by relativity theory). \n\nHenson (2013) and others have questioned this line of reasoning, including the\nconclusion that its appeal to holism or nonseparability helps one to\nunderstand how these correlations involving entangled systems come\nabout without any action at a distance that violates relativity\ntheory, Local Causality or Einstein’s (1948) \n\nHoward’s (1989,1992) identification of outcome independence with a\nseparability condition has proved controversial, as has Teller’s\n(1989) claim that violations of Bell inequalities are no longer\npuzzling if one embraces (physical) relational holism (Laudisa 1995;\nBerkowitz 1998; Henson 2013). Winsberg and Fine (2003) object that separability\nrequires only that the conditional joint probabilities be determined\nas some function of the marginal probabilities, whereas outcome\nindependence arbitrarily restricts this to be the product function. By\nallowing other kinds of functional dependence they are able to\nconstruct models of experiments whose results would exhibit violations\nof Bell inequalities. They claim that these models are both local and\nseparable even though they violate outcome independence. But Fogel (2007)\npresents alternative formalizations of the separability condition, of\nwhich several indeed imply outcome independence. The view that\nviolations of outcome independence are consistent with\nrelativity theory, while violations of parameter independence are not,\nhas also been criticized (Jones & Clifton 1993; Maudlin 2011).\nBut Myrvold (forthcoming) has responded by arguing that\nlocally-initiated state-vector collapse in violation of outcome\ndependence may be perfectly compatible with relativity. \n\nWhile diverging from the Copenhagen prescription mentioned above, some\n modal interpretations\n take real states of systems to be closely enough related to quantum\nstates that entangled systems’ violation of quantum state separability\nimplies some kind of holism or nonseparability. Van Fraassen (1991,\np. 294), for example, sees his modal interpretation as committed to “a\nstrange holism” because it entails that a compound system may fail to\nhave a property corresponding to a tensor product projection operator\n\\(P\\otimes I\\) even though its first component has a\nproperty corresponding to \\(P\\). In fact, a clearer case of\nholism would arise in a modal interpretation that implied that the\ncomponent lacked \\(P\\) while the compound had\n\\(P\\otimes I\\): ceteris paribus, that would\nprovide an instance of physical property holism. Healey (1989,1994)\noffered a modal interpretation and used it to present a model\naccount of the puzzling correlations which portrays them as resulting\nfrom the operation of a process that violates both\n spatial\n and\n spatiotemporal separability.\n He argued that, on this interpretation, the\n nonseparability\n of the process is a consequence of\n physical property holism;\n and that the resulting account yields genuine understanding of how\nthe correlations come about without any violation of relativity theory\nor Local Action. But subsequent work by Clifton and\nDickson (1998) and Myrvold (2001) cast doubt on whether the account\ncan be squared with relativity theory’s requirement of Lorentz\ninvariance. More recently Healey (forthcoming) has given a different\naccount of how quantum theory may be used to explain violations of\nBell inequalities consistent with Lorentz invariance and Local\nAction. This account involves no metaphysical holism or\nnonseparability. \n\nEsfeld (2001) takes holism, in the quantum domain and elsewhere, to\ninvolve more than just a failure of supervenience. He maintains that\na compound system is holistic in that its subsystems themselves count\nas quantum systems only by virtue of their relations to other\nsubsystems together with which they compose the whole. \n\nAs applied to physics,\n ontological holism\n is the thesis that there are physical objects that are not wholly\ncomposed of basic physical parts. Views of Bohr, Bohm and others may\nbe interpreted as endorsing some version of this thesis. In no case is\nit claimed that any physical object has nonphysical parts.\nThe idea is rather that some physical entities that we take to be\nwholly composed of a particular set of basic physical parts are in\nfact not so composed. \n\nIt was Bohr’s (1934) view that one can meaningfully ascribe properties\nsuch as position or momentum to a quantum system only in the context\nof some well-defined experimental arrangement suitable for measuring\nthe corresponding property. He used the expression ‘quantum\nphenomenon’ to describe what happens in such an arrangement. In\nhis view, then, although a quantum phenomenon is purely physical, it\nis not composed of distinct happenings involving independently\ncharacterizable physical objects—the quantum system on the one\nhand, and the classical apparatus on the other. And even if the\nquantum system may be taken to exist outside the context of a quantum\nphenomenon, little or nothing can then be meaningfully said about its\nproperties. It would therefore be a mistake to consider a quantum\nobject to be an independently existing component part of the\napparatus-object whole. \n\nBohm’s (1980, 1993) reflections on quantum mechanics led him to adopt\na more general holism. He believed that not just quantum object and\napparatus, but any collection of quantum objects by themselves,\nconstitute an indivisible whole. This may be made precise in the\ncontext of Bohm’s (1952) interpretation of quantum mechanics by noting\nthat a complete specification of the state of the “undivided\nuniverse” requires not only a listing of all its constituent\nparticles and their positions, but also of a field associated with the\nwave-function that guides their trajectories. If one assumes that the\nbasic physical parts of the universe are just the particles it\ncontains, then this establishes ontological holism in the context of\nBohm’s interpretation. But there are alternative views of the\nontology of the Bohm theory (see the entry\n Bohmian mechanics). \n\nSome (Howard 1989; Dickson 1998) have connected the failure of a\nprinciple of separability to ontological holism in the context of\nviolations of Bell inequalities. Howard (1989) formulates the following \nseparability principle (pp. 225–6) \n\nHe takes Einstein to defend this as a principle of individuation of\nphysical systems, without which physical thought “in the sense\nfamiliar to us” would not be possible. Howard himself contemplates the\npossible failure of this principle for\n entangled quantum systems,\n with the consequence that these could no longer be taken to be wholly\ncomposed of what are typically regarded as their subsystems. Dickson\n(1998), on the other hand, argues that such holism is not “a tenable\nscientific doctrine, much less an explanatory one” (p. 156). \n\nOne may try to avoid the conclusion that experimental violations of\nBell inequalities manifest a failure of\n Local Action\n by invoking ontological holism for events. The idea would be to deny\nthat these experiments involve distinct, spatiotemporally separate,\nmeasurement events, and to maintain instead that what we usually\ndescribe as separate measurements involving an entangled system in\nfact constitute one indivisible, spatiotemporally disconnected, event\nwith no spatiotemporal parts. But such ontological holism conflicts\nwith the criteria of individuation of events inherent in both quantum\ntheory and experimental practice. \n\nAharonov and Bohm (1959) drew attention to the quantum mechanical\nprediction that an interference pattern due to a beam of charged\nparticles could be produced or altered by the presence of a constant\nmagnetic field in a region from which the particles were\nexcluded. This effect has since been experimentally demonstrated. At\nfirst sight, the Aharonov-Bohm effect seems to involve action at a\ndistance. It seems clear that the (electro-)magnetic field acts on the\nparticles since it affects the interference pattern they produce; and\nthis must be action at a distance since the particles pass through a\nregion from which that field is absent. But alternative accounts of\nthe phenomenon are possible which portray it rather as a manifestation\nof (strong)\n nonseparability\n (Healey 1997). There need be no action at a distance if the\nbehavior both of the charged particles and of electromagnetism are\nnonseparable processes. While such a treatment of electromagnetism\n(and other gauge theories) is increasingly common in physics, to treat\nthe motion of the charged particles as a nonseparable process is to\nendorse a particular position on how quantum mechanics is to be\ninterpreted. \n\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics that ascribes a nonlocalized\nposition to a charged particle on its way through the apparatus is\ncommitted to a violation of\n spatiotemporal separability\n in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, since the particle’s passage constitutes\na nonseparable process. To see why the electromagnetism that acts on\nthe particles during their passage may also be taken to be\nnonseparable it is necessary to consider contemporary representations\nof electromagnetism in terms of neither fields nor vector\npotentials. \n\nFollowing Wu and Yang’s (1975) analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm effect,\nit has become common to consider electromagnetism to be completely and\nnonredundantly described neither by the electromagnetic field, nor by\nits vector potential, but rather by the so-called Dirac phase\nfactor: \n\nwhere \\(A_{\\mu}\\) is the electromagnetic potential at\nspacetime point \\(x^{\\mu}\\), \\(e\\) is the\nparticles’ charge, and the integral is taken over each closed loop\n\\(C\\) in spacetime. This can be seen as an instance of the more\ngeneral notion of the holonomy of a closed curve, a notion that has\ncome to the fore in contemporary formulations of gauge theories\nincluding electromagnetism in terms of fiber bundles (Healey (2007)).\nApplied to the Aharonov-Bohm case, this means that the constant\nmagnetic field is accompanied by an association of a phase factor\n\\(S(C)\\) with all closed curves \\(C\\) in space,\nwhere \\(S(C)\\) is defined by \n\n(where \\(\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the magnetic vector\npotential at point \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) of space). This approach has\nthe advantage that since \\(S(C)\\) is gauge-invariant, it\nmay readily be considered a physically real quantity. Moreover, the\neffects of electromagnetism in the field-free region may be attributed\nto the fact that \\(S(C)\\) is nonvanishing for certain\nclosed curves \\(C\\) within that region. But it is significant\nthat, unlike the magnetic field and its potential,\n\\(S(C)\\) is not defined at each point of space at each\nmoment of time. \n\nCan \\(S(C)\\) at some time be taken to represent an\nintrinsic property of a region of space corresponding to the curve\n\\(C\\)? There are two difficulties with this suggestion. The first\nis that the presence of the quantity \\(e\\) in the definition of\n\\(S(C)\\) appears to indicate that \\(S(C)\\)\nrather codes the effect of electromagnetism on objects with that\nspecific charge. If in fact all charges are multiples of some\nminimal value \\(e\\), then this would no longer be a problem: the\nvalue of \\(S(C)\\) for this minimal charge could then be\nviewed as representing an intrinsic property of a region of space\ncorresponding to the curve \\(C\\). If not, one could rather\ntake \n\nto represent an intrinsic property of \\(C\\). The second\ndifficulty is that closed curves do not correspond uniquely to regions\nof space: e.g., circling the region in which there is a magnetic field\ntwice on the same circle will produce a different curve from circling\nit once. But this does not prevent one from taking\n\\(S(C)\\) at some time to represent an intrinsic property\nof a loop—the oriented region of space traced out\nby a closed curve \\(C\\) that intersects itself only at its end-point. \n\nOnce these difficulties have been handled, it is indeed possible to\nconsider electromagnetism in the Aharonov-Bohm effect as faithfully\nrepresented at a time by a set of intrinsic properties of\nloops in space (or more generally space-time).\nBut if one does so, then electromagnetism itself manifests (strong)\n nonseparability.\n For these intrinsic properties do not supervene on any assignment of\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties at spacetime points in the\nregion concerned, nor even in arbitrarily small neighborhoods of those\npoints. Whether the magnetic field remains constant or changes, the\nassociated electromagnetism constitutes a nonseparable process, and so\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect violates\n spatiotemporal separability.\n If the motion of the particles through the apparatus is a\nnonseparable process, then it is possible to account for the\n\\(AB\\) effect in terms of a purely local interaction\nbetween electromagnetism and this process. For the particles\neffectively traverse loops traced out by closed curves \\(C\\) on\ntheir nonlocalized “trajectories”, and so they interact with\nelectromagnetism precisely where this is defined. \n\nAssuming it exhibits nonseparability, does the Aharonov-Bohm effect\ninvolve some kind of holism? The states of the particles need not be\nentangled with each other. But the state of the field may be thought\nto be holistic, in so far as the electromagnetic properties of loops\ndo not supervene on properties (such as electric and magnetic field\nstrengths) at the points that make up those loops. Since these are\nclassical fields, the Aharonov-Bohm effect may be taken to demonstrate\nholism as well as nonseparability even in classical\nphysics. However, a loop may also be thought of as traced out by a\ncurve composed by “stringing together” a set of curves\nthat trace out smaller loops, and removing segments traversed by two\nsuch curves in opposite directions. In that case, the holonomy\nproperties of any loop will be determined by those of an arbitrary set\nof smaller loops that compose it in this way (assuming spacetime is\nsimply connected). \n\nThis entry has focused mainly on metaphysical\nholism and its relation to nonseparability. That there is a\nvariety of alternative ways of understanding holism in physics is\nillustrated by a special issue of the journal Studies in the\nHistory and Philosophy of Physics (2004) devoted to this\ntopic. \n\nSeevinck (2004) proposes an epistemological criterion of holism and\nillustrates its application to physical theories. A physical theory\ncounts as holistic by this criterion if and only if it is impossible\nin principle to infer the global properties, as assigned in the\ntheory, by local resources available to an agent, where these include\n(at least) all local operations and classical communication. To apply\nthis criterion it is necessary to specify how a theory assigns\nproperties, a matter on which different interpretations of the theory\nmay disagree. Seevinck (2004) argues that neither classical physics\nnor Bohmian mechanics is holistic in this sense. Applying the\neigenvalue-eigenstate link to a particular state of a bipartite\nquantum system he then shows that this manifests epistemological\nholism, even when the state of the system is\nnot entangled. \n\nPlacek (2004) understands quantum state holism as involving a thesis\nabout probabilities: that the probability of a joint result of a\ncombined measurement on a pair of entangled quantum systems is not\ndetermined by the probabilities of the two results. But he takes this\nto be only one ingredient of a more complete conception, whose\nformulation and analysis requires a modal framework combining\nindeterminism, (rudiments of) relativistic space-time, and\nprobability—Belnap’s (1992) theory of branching\nspace-times. \n\nEsfeld (2004) argues for a metaphysics of relations based on a\ncharacterization of quantum entanglement in terms of non-separability,\nthereby regarding entanglement as a sort of holism. He there\ncharacterizes non-separability as follows: \n\nHe takes this to imply that any case of quantum entanglement is a case\nof non-separability, and non-separability is the reason why quantum\nentanglement is a sort of holism. (He discusses the relation between\nnon-separability and holism in chapter 8 of Esfeld (2001).) \n\nLyre (2004) and Healey (2004) see electromagnetism and other gauge\ntheories as manifesting nonseparability for reasons different from\nthose arising from quantum entanglement\n(cf. The Aharonov-Bohm Effect). Lyre takes\nthis to be a variant of spatiotemporal holism, and connects it to\nstructural realism. Healey argues that general relativity does not\nmanifest this kind of nonseparability even though it may be formulated\nas a gauge theory. He distinguishes two part/whole relations among the\nbearers of electromagnetic properties (space-time loops), and argues\nthat electromagnetism manifests holism according to one of these but\nnot the other. A more complete account is given in Healey (2007). \n\nCertain phenomena that arise within quantum field theory have been\ntaken to challenge principles of separability or to involve\nholism. These have been analyzed most intensively by mathematical\nphysicists and philosophers taking an algebraic approach to quantum\ntheory, even though many empirical successes of quantum field theory\nhave been achieved by following other approaches. \n\nAlgebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) represents the state in a region\nof spacetime by means of a function from an algebra of associated\n“field” or “observable” operators: the value\nof this function for a self-adjoint operator represents the expected\nresult of a measurement of the corresponding observable on that\nregion. A state is said to be decomposable (some say separable) across\nalgebras \\(R_{A}, R_{B}\\) associated with regions \\(A, B\\) if its\nrestriction \\(\\omega\\) to the algebra \\(R_{AB}\\) generated by \\(R_{A},\nR_{B}\\) is a product state—i.e. satisfies\n\\(\\omega(XY)=\\omega(X)\\omega(Y)\\), for all \\(X\\in R_{A}, Y\\in R_{B}\\);\nor if \\(\\omega\\) is a limit of convex combinations of product states:\notherwise, it is said to be entangled across \\(R_{AB}\\) (see\ne.g. Valente 2010, pp. 1031–2). This is a natural reformulation\nof a generalization to mixed states of the first condition for\nentanglement given in section 8.  \n\nEntanglement is endemic in AQFT. Summers and Werner (1985) proved that\nthe vacuum state of a quantum field is not only entangled across\nalgebras associated with certain spacelike separated regions of\nMinkowski spacetime, but that it also maximally violates Bell\ninequalities for algebras associated with these regions. They also\nproved (1988) that every state on a pair of space-like\nseparated open regions whose closures share a single point is\nmaximally entangled across their algebras. For each state, the degree\nof entanglement decreases rapidly with spatial separation. But if and\nonly\nif \\(R_{A}, R_{B}\\)\npossess what is called the split property is any state\ndecomposable across these algebras.  The split property (Valente 2010, p. 1035) is a strengthening of\nthe condition of microcausality (observables on space-like separated\nregions commute). Summers (2009) argues that it is meaningful to speak\nof independent subsystems in relativistic quantum theory if they can\nbe localized in spacetime regions \\(A, B\\) whose\nalgebras \\(R_{A}, R_{B}\\)\nposses the split property; and that most, if not all, physically\nrelevant models of quantum field theories have this property (for\nsufficiently space-like separated regions \\(A, B)\\). \n\nThe split property is a kind of independence condition. Rédei\n(2010) argues that, by conforming to this and other independence\nconditions, an AQFT can meet all the requirements Einstein (1948)\nconsidered necessary for a quantum theory satisfactorily to realize\nthe field-theoretic ideal. These were the requirement that physical\nthings be arranged in a space-time continuum (Spatiotemporality); that\nthings located in space-like separated regions have their own distinct\nstates (Independence); and that if \\(a, b\\) are located in space-like\nseparated regions \\(A, B\\) respectively, then an external influence on\n\\(a\\) has no immediate effect on \\(b\\) \n (Local Action). \n(The first two names are Rédei’s: the last\nis Einstein’s.) Rédei takes AQFT to satisfy\nSpatiotemporality because of its basic assumption that observables are\nlocalized in space-time regions; that an AQFT’s satisfaction of\nthe split property and other members of a hierarchy of independence\nconditions establishes Independence; and that an AQFT obeys Local\nAction insofar as it meets a condition he calls operational\nseparability.\n  In evaluating Rédei’s argument it is important to ask what\ncounts as a physical thing. Einstein mentioned two possible\ncandidates: bodies and fields.\n Howard’s separability principle\n permits a natural transposition of Einstein’s\n real state separability principle to\nfield theory. Entangled states in AQFT violate section\n5’s state separability principle just as they\ndo in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics even though the split property\nand related independence conditions on their algebras hold. So if the\ncontent of a space-time region were specified by its algebra in AQFT,\nconsidered as a physical system with real physical state given by a\nstate on that algebra, then Howard’s separability principle would\nfail. (Although the failure of the split property or other algebraic\nindependence conditions for certain regions in a quantum field theory\nwould represent a more radical threat to the separate existence of\nsuch physical systems in those regions than mere entanglement). But it\nis doubtful that Einstein would have counted observables or their\nalgebras as physical things. If instead these are taken to represent\nmagnitudes of physical fields or the spatio-temporal region on which\nthey are defined then meeting Rédei’s Independence requirement\nis still consistent with failure of Howard’s (stronger) separability\nprinciple. Finally meeting Rédei’s operational separability\ncondition only for non-selective operations would not suffice\nto ensure conformity to Local Action. Einstein’s reasons for rejecting\nthe completeness of quantum mechanical description are naturally\nextended to AQFT: if a state on its local algebra completely specifies\nthe real state of a space-time region then either the natural\nextension of his real state separability principle\nor his principle of Local Action fails. \nMetaphysical holism presupposes a division of a\nwhole into parts. To apply the part/whole distinction here one must\naddress the ontology of quantum field theory. Taking spacetime regions\nto be the relevant physical objects, one could understand the\nsystem/subsystem and part/whole relations in terms of spatiotemporal\ninclusion. To assess physical property holism\nor nonseparability we need to determine\nthe qualitative intrinsic properties and relations pertaining to\nspacetime regions in quantum field theory.  Arageorgis (2013) gives an example of quantum field states\nentangled across two regions which nevertheless, he argues, fail to\nexhibit the same kind of state nonseparability as\nsinglet and triplet spin states of a pair of quantum particles (see\nMaudlin 1998). But he suggests that his example does exhibit a kind of\nepistemological state nonseparability, in so far as an agent confined\nto a single region cannot determine its state by operations confined\nto that region. By applying the eigenvalue-eigenstate link to his\nexample, Arageorgis (2013) argues that the energy of a particular\ncompound quantum field system is not determined by the energies (or\nany other qualitative intrinsic properties and relations) of its\ncomponent subsystems. He concludes that this example manifests\nphysical property holism. \n\nWayne (2002) has suggested that quantum field theory is best\ninterpreted as postulating extensive holism or nonseparability. On\nthis interpretation, the fundamental quantities in quantum field\ntheory are vacuum expectation values of products of field operators\ndefined at various spacetime points. The field can be reconstructed\nout of all of these. Nonseparability supposedly arises because the\nvacuum expectation value of a product of field operators defined at an\n\\(n\\)-tuple of distinct spacetime points does not supervene on\nqualitative intrinsic physical properties defined at those \\(n\\)\npoints, together with the spatiotemporal relations among the\npoints. But it is not clear that vacuum expectation values of products\nof field operators defined at \\(n\\)-tuples of distinct spacetime\npoints represent either qualitative intrinsic physical properties of\nthese \\(n\\)-tuples or physical relations between them. Improved\nassessment of the extent to which quantum field theory illustrates\n holism\n or\n nonseparability\n must await further progress in the interpretation of quantum field\ntheory. (Kuhlman, Lyre and Wayne (2002) represents a relevant first\nstep: but see also Fraser (2008), Baker (2009).) \n\nString theory (or its descendant,\n\\(M\\)-theory) has emerged as a speculative candidate for unifying\nmuch of fundamental physics, including quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity. Existing string theories proceed by quantizing classical\ntheories of basic entities that are extended in one or more dimensions\nof a space that has 6 or 7 tiny compact dimensions in addition to the\nthree spatial dimensions of ordinary geometry. If these additional\ndimensions are appropriately considered spatial, then it is natural to\nextend the concepts of\n spatial\n and\n spatiotemporal\n separability to encompass them. In that case, processes involving\nclassical strings (or \\(p\\)-branes with \\(p \\gt 0\\)) would\ncount as (spatiotemporally) nonseparable, even though all particles\nand their properties conform to spatial separability. \n\nThe status of\n nonseparability\n within a quantized string field theory is not so easy to assess,\nbecause of the general problems associated with deciding what the\nontology of any relativistic quantum field theory should be taken to\nbe.","contact.mail":"rhealey@U.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"U.arizona.edu"}]
