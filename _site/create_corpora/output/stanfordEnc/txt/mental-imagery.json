It is also generally understood to bear\nintentionality (i.e., mental images are always images \nof something or other), and thereby to function as a form of\nmental representation. Traditionally, visual mental imagery,\nthe most discussed variety, was thought to be caused by the presence \nof picture-like representations (mental images) in the mind,\nsoul, or brain, but this is no longer universally accepted.\n\n\n\nVery often, imagery experiences are understood by their subjects as \nechoes, copies, or reconstructions of actual perceptual experiences \nfrom their past; at other times they may seem to anticipate possible,\noften desired or feared, future experiences. Thus imagery has often \nbeen believed to play a very large, even pivotal, role in both memory\n(Yates, 1966; Paivio, 1986) and motivation (McMahon, 1973). It is \nalso commonly believed to be centrally involved in visuo-spatial \nreasoning and inventive or creative thought. Indeed, according to a \nlong dominant philosophical tradition, it plays a crucial role in \nall thought processes, and provides the semantic grounding \nfor language. However, in the 20th century vigorous objections were \nraised against this tradition, and it was widely repudiated. More recently,\nit has once again begun to find a few defenders.\n\n\n\nMental imagery is a familiar aspect of most people's everyday\nexperience (Galton, 1880a,b, 1883; Betts, 1909; Doob, 1972; Marks, 1972,\n1999). A few people may insist that they rarely, or even never,\nconsciously experience imagery (Galton, 1880a, 1883; Faw, 1997, 2009;\nbut see Brewer & Schommer-Aikins, 2006), but for the vast majority\nof us, it is a familiar and commonplace feature of our mental\nlives. The English language supplies quite a range of idiomatic ways\nof referring to visual mental imagery: ‘visualizing,’\n‘seeing in the mind's eye,’ ‘having a picture in\none's head,’ ‘picturing,’ ‘having/seeing a\nmental image/picture,’ and so on. There seem to be fewer ways to\ntalk about imagery in other sensory modes, but there is little doubt\nthat it occurs, and the experiencing of imagery in any sensory mode is\noften referred to as ‘imagining’ (the appearance, feel,\nsmell, sound, or flavor of something). Alternatively, the\nquasi-perceptual nature of an experience may be indicated\nmerely by putting the relevant sensory verb (‘see,’\n‘hear,’ ‘taste,’ etc.) in actual or implied\n“scare quotes.” \n\nDespite the familiarity of the experience, the precise meaning of the\nexpression ‘mental imagery’ is remarkably hard to pin \ndown, and differing understandings of it have often added \nconsiderably to the confusion of the already complex and fractious \ndebates, amongst philosophers, psychologists, and cognitive \nscientists, concerning imagery's nature, its psychological functions \n(if any), and even its very existence. In the philosophical and \nscientific literature (and a fortiori in everyday \ndiscourse), the expression ‘mental imagery’ (or \n‘mental images’) may be used in any or all of at least \nthree different senses, which are only occasionally explicitly \ndistinguished, and all too often conflated: \n\nFar too many discussions of visual mental imagery fail to draw a \nclear distinction between the contention that people have \nquasi-visual experiences and the contention that such experiences are\nto be explained by the presence of representations, in the mind or \nbrain, that are in some sense picture-like. This picture\ntheory (or pictorial theory) of imagery experience is \ndeeply entrenched in our language and our folk psychology. The very \nword ‘image,’ after all, suggests a picture. However, \nalthough the majority of both laymen and experts probably continue to\naccept some form of picture theory, many 20th century philosophers \nand psychologists, from a variety of theoretical traditions, have \nargued strongly against it, and, in several cases they have developed\nquite detailed alternative, non-pictorial accounts of the nature and \ncauses of imagery experiences (e.g., Dunlap, 1914; Washburn, 1916; \nSartre, 1940; Ryle, 1949; Shorter, 1952; Skinner, 1953, 1974; \nDennett, 1969; Sarbin & Juhasz, 1970; Sarbin, 1972; Pylyshyn, \n1973, 1978, 1981, 2002a, 2003a, 2005; Neisser, 1976; Hinton, 1979; \nSlezak, 1991, 1995; Thomas, 1999b, 2009). Others, it should be said, have \ndeveloped and defended picture theory in sophisticated ways in the \nattempt to meet these critiques (e.g., Hannay, 1971; Kosslyn, 1980, \n1983,1994; von Eckardt, 1988, 1993; Tye, 1988, 1991; Cohen, 1996). \nHowever, despite these developments, much philosophical and \nscientific discussion about imagery and the cognitive functions it \nmay or may not serve continues to be based on the often unspoken (and \neven unexamined) assumption that, if there is mental imagery at all, \nit must consist in inner pictures.  \n\nConsider, for example, the title of the book The Case for Mental\nImagery, by Kosslyn, Thompson & Ganis (2006). In fact the\nbook is an extended and quite polemical defense of the much disputed\nview that visual mental imagery consists in representational brain\nstates that are, in some significant and important ways, genuinely\npicture-like (see supplement: The\nQuasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery, and its Problems). That is to\nsay, the contents suggest that the title should be understood as\nintending \"imagery\" in sense {2}. However,\nit would also be very natural (and, very possibly, in accord with the\nauthors' intentions – compare Kosslyn, Ganis & Thompson,\n2003) to understand the title as implying that the book's deeper\npurpose is to refute the view that imagery, even in\nsense {1}, does not really exist (or, at least, that\nthe concept of imagery will find no place in a properly scientific\nontology). Although this denialist view of imagery has few, if any,\nsupporters today, it is well known that not so very long ago, in the\nera of Behaviorist psychology, it had great influence.  The book's\ntitle thus (intentionally or otherwise) invites us to conflate the\n(now) very controversial view that mental images are picture-like\nentities, with what is, today, the virtual truism that people really\ndo have quasi-perceptual experiences, and that our science of the mind\nowes us some account of them.\n \n\nAnother way in which the expression ‘mental imagery’\n(together with many of its colloquial near-equivalents) may be\nmisleading, is that it tends to suggest only quasi-visual\nphenomena. Despite the fact that most scholarly discussions of imagery,\nin the past and today, do indeed focus mainly or exclusively upon\nthe visual mode, in fact, quasi-perceptual experience in other sensory\nmodes is just as real, and, very likely, just as common and just as\npsychologically important (Newton, 1982). Contemporary cognitive\nscientists generally recognize this, and interesting studies of\nauditory imagery, kinaesthetic (or motor)\nimagery, olfactory imagery, haptic (touch)\nimagery, and so forth, can be found in the recent scientific\nliterature (e.g., Segal & Fusella, 1971; Reisberg, 1992; Klatzky,\nLederman, & Matula, 1991; Jeannerod, 1994; Bensafi et\nal., 2003; Yoo et al., 2003;\nKobayashi et al., 2004; Djordjevic et al., 2004, 2005). Although such studies are still vastly outnumbered by\nstudies of visual imagery, ‘imagery’ has become the\ngenerally accepted term amongst cognitive scientists for\nquasi-perceptual experience in any sense mode (or any combination of\nsense modes). \n\nIn the introduction to this entry, in order to avoid making a \npremature commitment to the picture theory, and in accordance with \ndefinitions given by psychologists such as McKellar (1957), \nRichardson (1969), and Finke (1989), mental imagery was characterized\nas a form of experience (i.e., as {1}). However, \nthis itself is far from unproblematic. Evidence for the occurrence of\nany experience is necessarily subjective and introspective, and, \nbecause of this, those who have doubts about the validity of \nintrospection as a scientific method, may well be led to question \nwhether there is any place for a concept such as imagery within a \ntruly scientific world view. J.B. Watson, the influential instigator \nof the Behaviorist movement that dominated scientific psychology \n(especially in the United States) for much of the 20th century, \nquestioned the very existence of imagery for just these sorts of \nreasons (Watson, 1913a, 1913b, 1928 – \n see supplement; see also: \nThomas, 1989, Berman & Lyons, 2007). Although few later\nBehaviorist psychologists (or their philosophical allies) expressed\nthemselves on the matter in quite the strong and explicit terms\nsometimes used by Watson, the era of Behaviorist psychology is\ncharacterized by a marked skepticism about imagery (if not its\nexistence, at least its psychological importance) amongst both\npsychologists and philosophers. Imagery did not become widely\ndiscussed again among scientific psychologists (or philosophers of\npsychology) until around the end of the 1960s, when Behaviorism began\nto be displaced by Cognitivism as the dominant psychological\nparadigm. Most informed contemporary discussions of imagery, amongst\nboth philosophers and psychologists, are still very much shaped by\nthis recent history of skepticism about imagery (or\niconophobia, as it is sometimes called), and the subsequent \nreaction against it.  \n\nBy contrast with their Behaviorist predecessors, most cognitive\npsychologists today hold that imagery has an essential role to play in\nour mental economy. Many may share some of the reservations of their\nBehaviorist predecessors about the place of introspection and\nsubjectivity in science, but they take the view that imagery must be\nreal (and scientifically interesting) because it is explanatorily\nnecessary: The results of many experiments on cognitive functioning,\nthey hold, cannot be satisfactorily explained without making appeal to\nthe storage and processing of imaginal mental representations. The\nbelief that such mental representations are real is justified in the\nsame sort of way that belief in the reality of electrons, or natural\nselection, or gravitational fields (or other scientifically sanctioned\n“unobservables”) is justified: Imagery is known to exist\ninasmuch as the explanations that rely upon imaginal representations\nare known to be true. From this perspective, some theorists recommend\nthat the term ‘imagery’ should not be understood to refer\nto a form of subjective experience, but, rather, to a certain type of\n“underlying representation” (Dennett, 1978; Block, 1981a,\nIntroduction; Block, 1983a; Kosslyn, 1983; Wraga & Kosslyn, 2003;\nKosslyn, Thompson & Ganis, 2006). Such representations are\n“mental” in the sense now commonplace in cognitive\nscience: i.e., they are conceived of as being embodied as brain\nstates, but as individuated by their functional (and computational)\nrole in cognition. As Block (1981a, 1983a) points out, an advantage of\ndefining mental imagery in this way (i.e., as an unspecified form of\nrepresentation, as\n{3} rather than {2}) is that it \ndoes not beg the controversial question of whether the relevant \nrepresentations are, in any interesting sense, picture-like.  \n\nHowever, if it is not because they are picture-like, what is it that \nmakes these mental representations mental images? Presumably\nthe idea is that a mental representation deserves to be called an \nimage if it is of such a type that its presence to mind (i.e., its \nplaying a role in some currently occurring cognitive process) can \ngive rise to a quasi-perceptual experience of whatever is represented. \nBut this move relies upon our already having a grasp of the \nexperiential conception of imagery, which must, therefore, be more \nfundamental than the representational conception just \noutlined. Furthermore, to define imagery in the way that \nBlock, Kosslyn etc. suggest, as first and foremost a form of \nrepresentation (as explanans rather than \nexplanandum), is to beg more basic and equally controversial\nquestions about the nature of the mind and the causes of\nquasi-perceptual experiences. A number of scientists and philosophers,\ncoming from a diverse range of disciplinary and theoretical\nperspectives, do not accept that imagery experiences are caused by the presence\nto mind of representational tokens (e.g.,\nSartre, 1940; Ryle, 1949; Skinner, 1953, 1974; Sarbin, 1972; Thomas,\n1999b, 2009; O'Regan & Noë, 2001; Bartolomeo, 2002; Bennett &\nHacker, 2003; Blain, 2006). \n\nIt should be admitted, however, that focusing too narrowly on the \nexperiential conception of imagery has its own potential \ndangers. In particular, it may obscure the very real possibility, \nforegrounded by the representational conception, that \nimportantly similar underlying representations or mechanisms may \nsometimes be operative both when we consciously experience imagery \nand sometimes when we do not. Some evidence, such as Paivio's (1971, \n1983a, 1991a) work on the differential memorability of words with \ndifferent “imagery values” (see\n section 4.2,\n below), suggests that this is indeed the case. \n\nIn practice, both the experiential and the representational \nconceptions of imagery are frequently encountered in the literature \nof the subject. Unfortunately, it is often hard to tell which is \nintended in any particular case. Even where they are not actually \nconflated, confusion can arise when one conception is favored over \nthe other without this ever being made sufficiently clear or \nexplicit. Although it would be pedantic and potentially confusing to \ninsist on explicitly drawing the distinction everywhere, where it \nseems important or helpful to do so this entry will refer to \nimagery experiences (or quasi-perceptual \nexperiences) on the one hand, and imagery \nrepresentations (or imagery processes) on the other. \n\nThere are further potential problems, however, with the brief \ncharacterization of imagery given in our introduction. Not only does \nwhat is said there duck the difficult (and rarely considered) task of\nspecifying what dimensions and degrees of similarity to perception \nare necessary for an experience to count as imagery; it also elides \nthe controversial question of whether, despite the surface \nresemblance, imagery is a sui generis phenomenon, \nconceptually quite distinct from true perceptual experience, or \nwhether imagery and perception differ only in degree rather than in \nkind. \n\nSome, such as Hume (1740), hold that percepts (impressions in\nhis terminology) and images (ideas) do not differ in kind,\nbut only in their degree of “vivacity”or vividness. This\nview has frequently been criticized, however (Reid, 1764 II.5, VI.24;\nSavage, 1975; Warnock, 1976; McGinn, 2004). A related view, explicitly\ndefended by some (e.g., Jastrow, 1899; Savage, 1975; Thomas, 1997a,\n2014), and implicit in much of the other relevant literature, is that\nimagery, regardless of its subjective “vividness”, lies at\none end of a continuum or spectrum stretching from veridical, highly\nstimulus-driven and stimulus-constrained perception at one end, to\n“pure” imagery (where the content of the experience is\ngenerated entirely by the subject, and is quite independent of any\ncurrent stimulus input) at the other.  Several varieties of\nimaginative preceptual experience may be taken to fill in the\ncontinuum between these extremes: mistaken or illusive perceptions\n(imagining, for instance, that the bush seen indistinctly in the\ndarkness is a bear), and various types of non-deceptive seeing\nas or seeing in (such as imagining a cloud to have the\nshape of a camel, weasel, or whale; seeing a Laughing Cavalier in\npaint on canvas; seeing someone's sadness in their eyes; or seeing the\nnotorious duck-rabbit figure as a duck [or rabbit]). \n\nFigure 1.2_1\nThe Duck-Rabbit \n\nOthers, however, notably Reid (1764 II.5), Sartre (1936), Wittgenstein\n(1967 §621 ff.), McGinn (2004) and Ichikawa (2009), argue that\nthere is a sharp conceptual and phenomenological distinction to be\ndrawn between imagery and perception proper. After all, it is argued,\nour imagination, unlike our perception, is under the control of our\nwill (and experienced as such). Provided I know what an elephant looks\nlike, I can choose to imagine one wherever and whenever I want to, but\nI cannot choose to see an elephant unless one actually\nhappens to be present.  By contrast, if an elephant is present before\nmy open eyes, I cannot help but see it, whether I will or\n no.[1]\n McGinn (2004) restates\nthis argument with considerably more rigor and detail than his\npredecessors did, and, in addition, sets out eight further arguments\nthat, he thinks, point to the same conclusion, viz, that\nmental imagery is a phenomenon radically conceptually different in\nkind from perception. If true, this would appear to imply that all\nextant scientific theories about the nature and mechanisms of imagery\n(see §§4.4-4.5, below), and (to the best of my knowledge)\nall obsolete theories too (see §§2-3 below) must be false,\nas all of them depend on the assumption that mental images and\npercepts differ in degree rather than kind, and that there is a large\ndegree of overlap between the respective mechanisms that give rise to\neach. However, although all or most of the differences between images\nand percepts pointed out by McGinn (and Reid, Sartre and\nWittgenstein), are probably real enough, the claim that any of them\nreflect true differences in kind, rather than degree, is on much\nshakier ground. Taking on McGinn’s (and Ichikawa's) arguments in\ndetail, Thomas (2014), defends the notion of a spectrum or continuum\nof imaginative phenomena that encompasses not only veridical\nperception and mental imagery, but also such things as dreams,\nhallucinations, pareidolia, and various other types of both deceptive\nand non-deceptive “imaginative perceiving”. \n\nSartre (1940) and Wittgenstein (1967 §§627, 632) also argue\nthat (in sharp contrast to perception) we can derive no new\ninformation about the world from our imagery: No image can contain\nanything except what the imager put there, which must already have\nbeen in his or her mind. However, not only observation, but also\ninference can lead to knowledge, and it has been argued that mental\nimagery can and does support certain types of inference that give us\ngenuinely new knowledge about the real world (Kosslyn, 1980, 1983;\nTaylor, 1981, Georgiou, 2007; Thomas, \n2014).[2]\n McGinn, however, (2004\np. 19ff) argues that although Sartre and Wittgenstein overstate their\npoint, there is a genuine and important insight underlying what they\nsay: The information we can derive from our imagery is of a different\nsort, and is derived in a different way, from that which we get from\nperception. \n\nOn a more consensual note, with only rare exceptions (e.g. Wright,\n1983; Martin, 2008 p. 160) nearly all serious discussions of imagery\ntake it for granted that it bears intentionality in the sense\nof being of, about, or directed at\nsomething (Harman, 1998): A mental image is always an image\nof something or other (whether real or unreal), in the same\nsense that perception (whether veridical or not) is always perception\nof something (see Anscombe, 1965). It is in virtue of this\nintentionality that mental imagery may be (and usually is) regarded as\na species of mental representation that can, and often does, play an\nimportant role in our thought processes. \n\nIt is also generally accepted that imagery is, for the most part, \nsubject to voluntary control. Although it is true that images often \ncome into the mind unbidden, and sometimes it is hard to shake off \nunwanted imagery (for instance, a memory of some horrible sight that \none cannot get out of one's mind), most of us, most of the time can \nquite freely and voluntarily conjure-up and manipulate imagery of \nwhatever we may please (provided, of course, that we know what it \nlooks like). \n\nThere are quasi-perceptual experiences, such as afterimages,\nthat are not subject to this sort of direct voluntary control, and\nindeed, that do not seem to bear intentionality, but these are usually\n(at least implicitly) understood to be phenomena of a distinctly\ndifferent type from mental imagery proper\n (see supplement). \n\nFurther discussion of phenomena akin to, or sometimes \nconfused with, mental imagery:  \n\nIt seems likely that mental imagery has been discussed for as long as\nhumans have been trying to understand their own cognitive processes.\nIt receives attention in the oldest extended writings about cognition\nthat have come down to us – the works of Plato and Aristotle\n– and there is reason to believe it was discussed by yet earlier\nGreek thinkers. Plato's and particularly Aristotle's writings have\nundoubtedly had an enormous and continuing influence on how cognition\nin general and imagery in particular are conceptualized within both\nthe Western and the Muslim cultural traditions. However, there is\nreason to think that the phenomenon of imagery, if not this tradition\nof theorizing about it, is not culture bound.  Children as young as\nthree have been found to be aware their imagery, and of its subjective\nnature (Estes, 1994), and researchers have been able to gather\nintrospective reports and descriptions of mental imagery from members\nof non-Western cultures ranging from pre-literate tribal Africa (Doob,\n1972) to modern Japan (where, indeed, the empirical psychological\nstudy of imagery seems to have been taken up with some enthusiasm\n– Oyama & Ichikawa, 1990). Imagery is also said to play a\nsignificant role in traditional Hindu and Buddhist spiritual practices\n(Samuels & Samuels, 1972; Ricard, 2006), and apparent references to the\nphenomenon of imagery can be found in the works of classical\nChinese thinkers such as Confucius (e.g.\nAnalects 9:10 & \n 15:5).[3]\n There might well be important insights to be gleaned from the study \nof these various cultures' conceptions of imagery, but the available \nliterature on this is very sparse (but see Ricard, 2006,\nand the discussion that is printed following it). Thus, of necessity, what follows \nwill focus on the Western philosophical and scientific tradition. In \nany case, the seeds of the controversies about imagery that erupted \nin the 20th century were sown not in Africa or the Orient,\nbut in Greece.  \n\nThe following supplements discuss Greek conceptions of \nimagery prior to the work of Aristotle: \n Supplement: Ancient Imagery Mnemonics\n  \n Supplement: Plato and his Predecessors\n  \n\nWhere Plato regarded images as irremediably deceptive, Aristotle, \nalthough he certainly recognized their potential for leading us \nastray (De Anima 428a-b), saw them as playing an essential \nand central role in human cognition, one closely akin to that played \nby the more generic notion of mental representation in \ncontemporary cognitive science. Indeed, he developed what amounts to \nthe first comprehensive cognitive theory, a theory that has been \nenormously influential over the subsequent ages, and continues \n(mostly indirectly) to shape much scientific and philosophical \nthought about the mind even today. He was clearly aware of, and very \npossibly influenced by, the mnemonic imagery techniques in use in \nGreece \n (see supplement),\n to which he alludes in at least four passages in his extant writings \n(Topica 163b28, De Anima 427b18, De \nMemoria 452a12–16, De Insomniis 458b20–22).  \n\nAristotle's Greek word, that is commonly and traditionally translated\nas \"[mental] image\" is “phantasma” \n(plural: phantasmata), a term used by Plato to refer to \nreflections in mirrors or pools (or the liver), amongst other things,\nbut which Aristotle seems to reserve to appearances in the psyche. \nAristotle describes phantasmata as being analogous to \npaintings or wax impressions (De Memoria  450a-b), and as \n“a residue of the actual [sense] impression” (De \nInsomniis  461b; cf. Rhetorica 137a 28) or “a \nmovement resulting from an actual exercise of a power of sense”\n(De Anima  429a 1–3). Some modern scholars, it should be \nnoted, have questioned the translation of \n\"phantasma\" as \"image,\" in part because \nAristotle does not always seem to think of phantasmata as \ninner pictures, and also because he seems to think of them as playing\na role in perception itself (Nussbaum, 1978; Schofield, 1978; \nBirondo, 2001). As Hume distinguished impressions from \nideas, contemporary colloquial English distinguishes between\npercepts and the mental images that we experience \nwhen we fantasize, daydream, or recall some experience from memory. \nAristotle's concept of phantasma seems to collapse this\ndistinction. It has thus been suggested that \n\"phantasma\" would be better translated as \n\"appearance\" (Lycos, 1964) or \"presentation\" \n(Beare, 1906) rather than as \"image\". However, contemporary\nscientific theories of imagery (see sections\n 4.4 and 4.5) \nalso, for the most part, do not make a sharp distinction in kind between \nmental images and percepts, and are virtually unanimous in holding \n(as, indeed, did Hume) that both are varieties of a single species.  \n\nIn any case, it is abundantly clear that, in many even if not all\ncases, Aristotle uses \"phantasma\" to refer to what\nwe now call a mental image. Phantasmata have several\nfunctions paralleling those ascribed to imagery by modern folk\npsychology (and some scientific psychology). In particular, they are\ncentral to Aristotle's theory of memory (De Memoria et\nReminiscentia; see Sorabji, 1972) and to his theory of thought.\nNot only does remembering essentially involve the recall of imagery of\npast experiences, but, he tells us, \"It is impossible to think\nwithout an image [phantasma],\" (De Memoria 450a\n1; cf. De Anima  431a 15–20 & 432a\n8–12). Phantasmata also play a key role in his account of\ndesire and motivation (e.g. De Anima  431a — see Nussbaum,\n1978): When some desirable object is not actually present to our\nsenses, exerting its pull on us directly, our motivation to strive to\nobtain it is driven by our awareness of its (memory or fantasy)\nimage. (This idea is still found in modern, scientific theories of\ndesire (McMahon 1973; Kavanagh et al., 2005; Andrade et\nal., 2009).) Aristotle also apparently held that linguistic\nmeaning derives from imagery, spoken words being but the symbols of\nthe inner images (De Interpretatione 16a 5–9;\nDe Anima  420b 29–32; see Modrak, 2001). Today, few theorists\nof language take this notion seriously (but see Paivio, 1986, 2007;\nPrinz, 2002), but it was almost universally accepted until relatively\nrecent times (Wollock, 1997; and see\n section 3.3 below).  \n\nVery arguably, Aristotle's views about imagery (phantasmata)\ncannot be fully understood in isolation from his views about \nimagination (phantasia), which he defined as “(apart \nfrom any metaphorical sense of the word) the process by which we say \nthat an image [phantasma] is presented to us” (De \nAnima  428a 1–4). Aristotle has been accredited with the very \ninvention of the concept of imagination (Schofield, 1978), and \ncertainly it seems fair to say that the roots of most subsequent \ndiscussions of the concept can be traced back to his work (even \nthough, for him, it did not have the strong association with \ncreativity and aesthetic insight that it has since acquired, mostly \nthrough the influence of the Romantic movement) (Watson, 1988; White,\n1990; Thomas, 1999a). Unfortunately, however, Aristotle's remarks \nabout phantasia, suggestive and influential though they are,\nare scattered widely amongst the surviving texts, and the only \nextended discussion of the concept (in De Anima  III.3) is \nparticularly difficult to interpret, not only because the text that \nhas come down to us seems to be more than usually corrupt (Nussbaum, \n1992), but also because of the richness and density of its arguments \nand its peculiarly oblique approach to the ostensible subject matter.\nAfter over two millennia of discussion, scholars still do not agree \nabout crucial aspects of Aristotle's conception of \nphantasia, and thus about his view of the fundamental nature\nof \n imagery.[4] \n\nFurther discussion of the aftermath and influence of Aristotle's work on \nimagery:  \n\nIt can hardly be denied that the concept of the idea was \ncentral to much of modern philosophy. Ideas were mental \nrepresentations, and very frequently, though not necessarily always, \nthey were (explicitly or implicitly) conceived of as mental images. \nEven if some authors did not themselves take ideas to be \nimages, it is likely that many of their readers would have taken them\nto be doing so. Thus, claims about the nature of ideas, and the \ncognitive and epistemological roles they could or could not play, \nwere often conditioned by whether or not a philosopher did \nconceive of ideas as images, and by what imagery was taken to be. \n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary records a clear example of the\nword 'idea' being used in the sense of mental image as far \nback as 1589, but philosophical confusion over whether or not ideas \nare images goes back at least to the “father of Modern \nPhilosophy,” Descartes. Certainly the “clear and distinct\nideas” that play such a prominent role in the \nMeditations (1641), and in Descartes' epistemology more \ngenerally, are not conceived to be mental images. We are \ntold that we can attain clear and distinct ideas of such things as \nGod and the human mind (Meditation 4, 53).\nNeither of these are things of which we have perceptual, let alone \nquasi-perceptual, experience. But Descartes insists that even our \nideas of perceptible things are, inasmuch as they are clear and \ndistinct, not perceptual or imaginative. His perceptual and \nimaginative grasp of the nature of a piece of wax, he tells us, can \nnever match the clarity and distinctness of the idea of the wax that \ncan potentially be attained by purely mental scrutiny (Meditation\n2, 31).  \n\nHowever, we also find in Descartes' work another conception of \nidea as something that is quasi-perceptual (and, \nindeed, pictorial) and is formed in the imagination. These \nideas may not be capable of providing the sure epistemological \nfoundation that Descartes thinks the clear and distinct ideas of the \nintellect can give us, but they are real nonetheless, and probably \nplay a larger role in ordinary, non-philosophic thinking. Although \nthey are alluded to in many of Descartes works, these imagistic ideas\nare explained most fully in the Treatise of Man, where he \npropounds his speculative physiological theory of visual perception \nin some \n detail.[5]\n The nervous system is described as working by a form of hydraulics, \nwith the nerve fibres (including those that make up the brain) \nfunctioning as hollow pipes carrying a fluid called animal \n spirit.[6]\n In the center of the brain is the pine-cone-shaped pineal gland, \nslight movements of which, Descartes believed, were somehow able \ndirectly to affect, and be affected by, the thoughts of the \nimmaterial soul. Figure 2.3.1_1, taken from the Treatise, \nshows his model of visual perception: As a result of the formation of\noptical images on the retinae of the eyes, the nerves produce another\nimage, isomorphic to the retinal \n image[7]\n (but re-inverted, so as to be upright), that is picked out on the \nsurface of the gland by the flow of animal spirits through its \n pores.[8]\n Thus points a, b, and \nc on the surface of the gland correspond to points \nA, B, and C of the\narrow which is being observed. The tracing of the image on its \nsurface causes the gland to move in a subtle and complex \nfashion that (in some unexplained way) causes a conscious visual \nexperience of the arrow in the soul (Descartes 1664 – see \nparticularly pp. 83ff. in Hall's translation).  \n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.3.1_1 Diagram from Descartes' \nTreatise of Man (1664), showing the formation of inverted \nretinal images in the eyes, and the transmission of these images, via\nthe nerves so as to form a single, re-inverted image (an \nidea) on the surface of the pineal gland. \n\nAt the same time that the flow of animal spirits is causing visual \nexperiences by moving the pineal, elsewhere in the brain it is \ncausing visual memories to be laid down by its action upon the nerve \nfibres themselves. These changes to hydraulic structure of the brain \nallow for mental images of memory and imagination to arise by the \nrecreation of formerly experienced flow patterns of spirits at the \npineal surface. Descartes explicitly tells us that the surface of the\npineal gland is the “seat of imagination \n [l'imagination]”[9]\n and that the images traced there are “ideas” \n[idées] (Descartes 1664 – p. 86 in Hall's \ntranslation; see also Descartes 1648 – p. 27 in Cottingham's \ntranslation). \n\nAt least one of Descartes' followers, de la Forge, suggested \nthat the term “idée [idea]” should be \napplied only to concepts in the intellect, and coined the expression \n“espèces corporelles [corporeal species]”\nto refer to the pictorial images of the imagination (Clarke, 1989). \nHowever, this was clearly not Descartes' own practice. Indeed, in the\nThird Meditation we are told that, strictly speaking, the \nword 'idea' should only be applied to thoughts that “are as it \nwere the images of things” (Meditation 3, 37). On the \nother hand, in his letter to Mersenne of July 1641 he seems to say \njust the opposite: ideas are in our minds (presumably our immaterial \nsouls), and in so far as images are “in the corporeal \nimagination” they should not properly be called ideas at all \n(Cottingham et al., 1991 pp. 185; see also Meditation \n3, 40). The thought here seems to be that all ideas as such are \nin our minds, although some of them are caused or occasioned by the \npresence of an image on the pineal surface. It is beyond the scope of\nthis entry to determine what was truly Descartes' considered view. \nWhat is clear, however, is that Descartes' readers would have readily\nbeen able to find a concept of the idea as a picture-like \nimage in his writings.  \n\nIn his Optics (1637, discourses 4 & 6), Descartes likens\nthe images of his theory to engravings: flat, perspective projections\nof visual scenes. It is notable, however, that this comparison is \nmade in the course of an argument to the effect that the \nrepresentations in the brain that cause our perceptual and \nimaginative experiences need not actually resemble their \nobjects: the resemblance between an engraving and what it depicts is,\nafter all, very partial and imperfect. What matters, for Descartes, \nis that the conscious soul is appropriately affected by the movements\nthat the process of image formation causes in the pineal gland. Thus \nit is the functional role of the image, not its actual physical \nnature, that is important. In this regard, Descartes' view is very \nclose (at least in terms of functional architecture) to the \ncontemporary quasi-pictorial theory of Kosslyn (1980, 1994, \n2005; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006 – see \n section 4.4.2\n and \n supplement: Quasi-Pictorial Theory ).\n In both cases, it is claimed that although the material image in the \nbrain is, in fact, picture-like, what actually makes it a \nmental image (or an idea) is not its \ntwo-dimensional neural instantiation, but its functional role in \nconveying visuo-spatial information to “higher” cognitive\npowers.  \n\nAs a materialist, Hobbes, unlike Descartes, does not distinguish \nbetween images formed in the brain and ideas in the mind. In fact, \nalthough Hobbes sometimes uses the word 'idea' as a synonym for \n'image,' it occurs rather infrequently in his writings, and he \nprefers to use 'image' (or 'imagination') or other synonyms such as \n'phantasm' or 'appearance.'  \n\nImages, however, are undoubtedly central to his cognitive theory. \nThought or “Mentall Discourse,” according to Hobbes, is \nnothing but a “trayne of imaginations,” an associatively \nconnected succession of images passing through the mind, whether it \nbe undirected (as in daydreaming or idle woolgathering) or more \nfocused and purposive because it is “regulated by some\ndesire, and designe,” by some overarching “Passionate \nThought” (Leviathan I.3 (Hobbes, \n 1651)).[10] \n\nHowever, it is not necessarily the case that Hobbes thought of his \nimages, even those of visual appearances, as being picture-like. \nImagination, we are told, “is nothing but decaying \nsense” (Leviathan \n I.2).[11]\n Because Hobbes regarded sensation as a sort of motion or pressure \narising in the brain (or heart) in response to an inward pressure \narising for external objects, the sort of decaying he has in mind \nseems unlikely to be that of a picture (or other representational \nobject) crumbling to dust. Rather, it is that of a movement gradually\nrunning out of impetus, a pendulum swing gradually decreasing in \namplitude, or a gas under pressure gradually leaking away. \nFurthermore, Hobbes, unlike Descartes, did not think of memory as \nbeing the result of structural changes in the brain, but rather as \narising from the persistence, the very slow dying away, of the \ninternal motions that were originally set going by sense experience \n(Leviathan \n I.2).[12]\n Hobbesian images, therefore, are processes rather than entities. \nAlthough they are undoubtedly quasi-perceptual experiences \n(presumably, in the absence of an immaterial soul, we are to suppose \nthat they are experienced merely in virtue of their occurring within \nthe brain) they may not be mental pictures in any very \nrobust sense. \n\nUnlike his predecessors, Locke did not concern himself with the \nnature or underlying mechanisms of mental imagery. Henceforth, at \nleast until the rise of cognitive science in the late 20th century, \nthat would be seen as the concern of scientists rather than \n philosophers[13]\n (and as it turned out, the scientists did not have much to say about \nthe matter either, until, once again, the era of cognitive science). \nFurthermore, Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding \n(1690) uses the words 'image' and 'imagination' only rarely (White, \n1990; Ayers, 1991 p. \n 45).[14]\n However, he has a great deal to say about ideas, which are \nthe vehicles of thought of his cognitive theory. Although what may be\nthe canonical definition of idea as “whatever it is \nwhich the mind can be employed about in thinking” \n(Essay I.i.8), seems to be deliberately noncommital about \ntheir nature, there are several passages in Locke's Essay \nthat suggest that he thought of them, at least when they were of \nvisual origin, as being picture-like. Indeed, he explicitly refers to\nideas as “the pictures drawn in our minds” \n(Essay II.x.5; see also II.x.7, II.ix.8, II.xxv.6, \nII.xxxi.6, IV.xi.1), and draws an analogy between the way that ideas \nenter the mind and the formation of optical images within a \ncamera obscura (a “dark room”) (Essay \nII.xi.17).  \n\nIt is thus hardly surprising that, according to Lowe (2005 p. 38), it\nremains “orthodox” to interpret Locke as holding that \nideas are pictorial mental images. This orthodoxy is defended by \nAyers (1986, 1991) and White (1990) amongst others, but other recent \nLocke scholars, notably Yolton (1956, 1970, 1984, 1985, 1996), \nChappell (1994), and, more tentatively, Lowe (1995, 2005) challenge \nit, arguing that the explicit comparisons of ideas with pictures are \nall limited merely to bringing out some or other specific aspect of \nthe nature of ideas, and should not be read as identifying \nthem with pictures. According to Yolton, there is no \nevidence that Locke thought of ideas as entities of any sort\n(Yolton 1970 p. 134), rather, “To say that we know objects by \nmeans of ideas is to say no more than that objects become known \nthrough sensory awareness” (Yolton, 1985 p. 151). Lowe \nexpresses what may be much the same underlying thought by suggesting \nthat Locke may perhaps be interpreted as holding an \n“adverbial” theory of ideas, whereby they are construed \nas ways (or modes) of experiencing rather than as mental entities \n(Lowe, 1995 pp. 42– 47, 2005 pp. 47–48). \n\nIt is worth noting, however, that some recent philosophers have \nargued for just such an “adverbial” account of mental \nimagery itself, construing images as modes of experiencing, rather \nthan the presence to mind of inner entities (Rabb, 1975; Heil, 1982; \nTye, 1984; Thomas, 1999b, 2009; Meijsing, 2006). Enactive theories of \nimagery (see \n section 4.5.1)\n can be viewed as fleshed out versions of this position (Thomas, \n1999b). Thus, even if Yolton and others are right to argue that Locke \ndid not think of ideas (even visual ones) as pictures (imagery in\n sense {2}), \nor even as inner entities of any sort (sense {3}),\nhe might still have consistently viewed \nthem as images in sense {1}, as\nquasi-perceptual experiences. He \ncertainly held that they arise from \n perception,[15]\n and that we are conscious of them when we employ them in our thinking\n(Essay II.i.2–3, I.i.8, II.xxvii.9).  \n\nWhatever Locke's true intentions may have been, many of his leading \nsuccessors and critics, such as Berkeley and Reid, seem to have \nunderstood him as believing that ideas are inner representational \nentities, and, when visual, are like inner pictures.\n \n\nFew seem to doubt that Berkeley thought of ideas as being images (but see Pitcher, 1977; \nKasem, 1989). Indeed, his famous and influential attack (in The \nPrinciples of Human Knowledge (1734)) on the possibility of \nabstract or general ideas clearly derives most of its persuasiveness \nfrom the assumption that ideas are like pictures: \n\nOr again, a general idea of a triangle \n\nIn effect, Berkeley is arguing that we can form ideas of things that \nwe have never actually seen just inasmuch as we can form new mental \npictures by the sort of cutting and pasting operations we could \nperform with pictures on paper – sticking the picture of a \nman's head onto a picture of the body of a horse, for example –\nbut that, just as there is no way of drawing or creating a picture \nthat inherently depicts the general man or the general triangle, we \ncan form no such general ideas in our \n minds.[16]\nIf ideas are images (and if mental images are pictures), Berkeley's\nargument (which continues to influence today's discussions of imagery\nand mental representation (e.g., Fodor, 1975)) may very well be\nsound. If they are not images at all, it makes little sense (and if\nmental images are not much like pictures, it is probably invalid). \n\nAs with Locke, Yolton (1996) argues that Hume did not \nunderstand the ideas of his cognitive theory to be mental \nimages. However, there is a great deal in Hume's writings (much more \nthan in Locke's) to suggest otherwise. Indeed, A Treatise of \nHuman Nature (Hume, 1740) opens by explicitly identifying ideas \nwith images: ideas are defined as “the faint images of\n[sensory impressions] in thinking and reasoning” \n(Treatise I.i.1). It is conceivable that 'image' might mean \nnothing more than 'copy' here, but many other passages in both the \nTreatise and the Enquiry Concerning Human \nUnderstanding (1748) suggest that Hume intended it in a much \nstronger sense. For example, he refers to the memory one might have \nof some site in the Holy Land, after having actually been there, as \nboth a “lively image” and a “lively idea” of \nthe place (Treatise I.iii.9), clearly treating the two \nexpressions as equivalent. Furthermore, ideas are constantly being \ndescribed as having their existence in, or being present to, the \nimagination or the \n fancy,[17]\n and we are told that we need only the “slightest \nphilosophy” to convince us “that nothing can ever be \npresent to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses \nare only the inlets, through which these images are conveyed” \n(Enquiry \n XII.1).[18] \n\nThe passages just cited (and others like them) perhaps imply no more \nthan that Hume thought of ideas as quasi-perceptual experiences (a \nconclusion that Yolton might be able to accept), but the fact that \nHume approvingly repeats Berkeley's argument against general ideas \n(Treatise I.iii.1; Enquiry XII.1) suggest that he \nalso thought of them as picture-like. This is also suggested by his \nchoice of the word 'impression' to designate the percepts of which \nideas are the images or copies. Clearly the word alludes to the wax \nimpression model of perception and memory that we find in Plato and \nAristotle, and although Hume, no doubt, does not intend it to be \nunderstood too literally, the fact that he thinks it an appropriate \nand innocuous metaphor remains telling.  \n\nCertainly when Thomas Reid came to develop his influential critique \nof “the way of ideas,” in effect a comprehensive \nrejection of the idea as the vehicle of thought, he based \nmany of his arguments upon the assumption that the philosophers he \nwas criticizing understood ideas to be picture-like images (Reid, \n1764, \n 1785).[19]\n Such images, Reid thinks, are simply not capable of playing the \ncognitive and epistemological roles that his predecessors had \nassigned to them, and the assumption that they do so leads to many \nabsurdities. Reid is not saying that we do not have quasi-perceptual \nexperiences, but he wants to deny that these are caused by \nrepresentational mental entities that we experience in lieu of some \nactually present physical object or scene. \n\nWhen we come to Kant (1781/1787), we find that ideas have \nbeen displaced, as the vehicles of thought, by concepts. \nHowever, images still have a significant role to play in his account \nof how our concepts connect to empirical reality. The imagination \n(einbildungskraft) must synthesize the inchoate deliverances\nof the senses, the sensory manifold, into a coherent, meaningful \nimage, a true representation that the understanding can grasp and \nbring under some concept. Unfortunately, Kant was unable to give a \nsatisfactory account of how the imagination, even in concert with the\nunderstanding, can achieve this. We are told that it involves what he\ncalls a schema, a “representation of a universal procedure of \nimagination in providing an image for a concept” (1781/1787 \nB180). We are told that it is only “through” and \n“in accordance with” a schema that images become possible\n(1781/1787 A 142). Unfortunately, however,  \n\nThus Kant, in attempting to grapple with problems about the nature of\nmental representation that the Empiricists had failed to solve, left \nthe process of image formation, and the nature of the image itself, \ndeeply mysterious. \n\nWhen psychology first began to emerge as an experimental science, in \nthe philosophy departments of the German universities in the late \n19th century, and soon after in the United States, the central role \nof imagery in mental life was not in question. For these pioneering \nexperimentalists, such as Wilhelm Wundt in Germany and William James \nin America, mental images (often, following the established usage of \nthe Empiricist philosophical tradition, referred to as \nideas) held just the same central place in the explanation \nof cognition that they had held for philosophical psychologists of \nearlier times. Edward B. Titchener, a student of Wundt who \nestablished himself as a leading figure in American psychology, was \nparticularly interested in imagery, and an experiment performed by \none of his students, C.W. Perky, has become particularly well known. \nIt is often assumed that it shows that there is no \nqualitative experiential difference between mental images and \npercepts, but further experimental investigations have raised some \ndoubts about this conclusion (see \n Supplement: The Perky Experiment).\n  \n\nHowever, developments within psychology at the beginning of the 20th \ncentury began to cast doubt on this long established consensus. A \ngroup of psychologists working in Würzburg, Germany, lead by \nanother former student of Wundt's, Oswald Külpe, claimed to have\nfound empirical evidence that certain conscious thought contents are \nneither imaginal nor perceptual in character. Their results were \nchallenged on several grounds by Wundt, Titchener and others, and \nwere certainly never definitively established. Nevertheless, the \nbitter dispute that ensued, the so called imageless thought \ncontroversy, had a profound effect on the development of scientific \npsychology (and, very arguably, philosophy too). Most psychologists \nbecame, in effect, profoundly disillusioned with the whole notion of \nmental imagery, and either avoided seriously considering the topic, \ntreated it dismissively, or, in some extreme cases, denied the \nexistence of the phenomenon outright. These attitudes noticeably \ninfluenced other disciplines, including philosophy. Although the \npsychological study of imagery revived with the rise of cognitivism \nin the 1960s and 70s, when new experimental techniques were developed\nthat enabled a truly experimental study of the phenomenon, current \nviews about, and attitudes towards, mental imagery cannot be properly\nunderstood without an awareness of this history, versions of which, \nof varying degrees of accuracy, have passed into the folklore of \npsychology.  \nThe following supplements discuss ideas and research about \nimagery in early (late 19th and early 20th century) scientific \npsychology:  \n Supplement: Founders of Experimental Psychology: Wilhelm Wundt and William James\n  \n Supplement: Edward B. Titchener: The Complete Iconophile\n  \n Supplement: The Perky Experiment\n  \n\nPerhaps Wundt's most important German student was Oswald Külpe, \nwho had for several years served as Wundt's assistant professor, but \neventually left to set up his own laboratory in the philosophy \ndepartment of Würzburg University. He and his students there \ndeveloped a direct challenge to the prevalent imagery theory of \nthought. Under the influence of both Machian positivism and, later, \nthe act psychology of Brentano and the phenomenology of Husserl, \nKülpe, like Titchener (whom he had helped train), rejected what \nhe saw as Wundt's unnecessarily strict methodological restrictions on\nthe scope of empirical science, and encouraged his students to extend\nthe scope of the introspective method to the study of the \n“higher” processes of thought and reasoning (Danziger, \n1979, 1980; Ash, 1998). In 1901, two of these students, Mayer and \nOrth, performed a word association experiment in which subjects were \nasked to report everything that had passed through their mind between\nhearing the stimulus word and giving the response. Note that it was \nnormal practice, in this era of psychology, for experimental \nsubjects, or observers as they were more often called, to be\ndrawn from among fellow researchers within the same laboratory, often\nincluding the supervising professor. Present day psychologists would,\nwith good reason, suspect such subjects of being liable to produce \nresults strongly biased by theoretical preconceptions (Orne, 1962; \nIntons-Peterson, 1983). Great pains are usually taken, today, to \nensure that subjects in psychological experiments have no idea what \nhypothesis the experiment is supposed to be testing. In 1901 however,\nit was thought that experienced and knowledgeable observers \nwere more likely to produce consistent and meaningful results than \nthe psychologically untrained. In the case of the Meyer and Orth \nexperiment, two amongst the four subjects were Meyer and Orth \nthemselves. Nevertheless, they professed to be surprised by some of \ntheir findings. In particular: \n\nThe jargon term bewusstseinslagen (“states of \nconsciousness” — Humphrey, 1951) was coined to designate \nthese indescribable non-sensorial states, and they soon began to turn\nup in more and more profusion in the introspective reports generated \nin the Würzburg laboratory, taking on an increasing theoretical \nsignificance as time went by. In 1905 another Würzburg \nresearcher, Ach, also introduced the largely overlapping, but more \nexplicitly intentionalistic concept of bewusstheit or \n“awareness”, an unanalysable “impalpably given \n‘knowing’” (Ach, quoted and translated by Humphrey,\n1951), and by 1907, Karl Bühler, perhaps the most radical of \nKülpe's students, was simply referring to gedanken \n(“thoughts”). Bühler's experiments might, for \nexample, involve giving a subject (often professor Külpe \nhimself) a somewhat gnomic sentence to interpret (e.g., \n“Thinking is so extraordinarily difficult that many prefer to \njudge”) and then collecting introspective reports of the \nconscious, but allegedly non-imaginal, gedanken that had \noccurred between the hearing of the sentence and the giving of the \ninterpretation. Although the Würzburg school never denied that \nimagery does occur, by this time the greater part of the conscious \ncontents of minds examined in Würzburg seemed to be \nnon-imaginal.  \n\nUnsurprisingly, Wundt, and others, refused to accept these new \nmethods and conclusions, and a heated debate, the so called \nimageless thought controversy, ensued. Though Wundt was \nsurely skeptical of the existence of imageless thoughts, his primary \ncriticisms were methodological. He was very much concerned with the \nfact that the experiments were necessarily constructed so that the \nintrospective reports were given after the completion of the\nexperimental task (word association, sentence interpretation, or \nwhatever). The Würzburg research thus involved discursive \nrecollection (or was it reconstruction?) of conscious contents that \nwere no longer present to the mind. Such experiments, Wundt argued, \nwere open invitations to suggestion, and, indeed, were \n\nTitchener (see \n supplement)\n also strongly objected to the alleged demonstrations of imageless \nthought, but for different reasons. He did not object to the aims or \nthe introspective methodology of the Würzburg school, but to \ntheir purported results, and, for him, the experiments were not so \nmuch misconceived as incompetently executed: In particular, he felt, \nthe observers (experimental subjects) in Würzburg had \nbeen inadequately trained in the art of introspection. According to \nTitchener, the main pitfall of introspection was what he called the \n“stimulus error,” the strong tendency to confound the \nconscious experience itself with whatever it might represent. Thus, \nto report, when looking at a rectangular table top, that one \nexperiences a rectangle, would be to commit the stimulus error: The \n“real” conscious content would (on Titchener's view) have\nthe trapezoidal shape that the table top projects upon the retina. \nFor Titchener, the intentionality generally ascribed to imageless\nthoughts was clear evidence that the Würzburg introspectors\nwere committing the stimulus error systematically: They were not \nreporting the intrinsic nature of their conscious contents, but what \nthose contents signified. Titchener suggested that the purported \nbewusstseinslagen etc. were, in fact, faint and fleeting \nkinaesthetic sensations, feelings of muscular tension and the like \n(Tweney, 1987). In Titchener's own laboratory, experiments quite \nsimilar to those done in Würzburg, but carried out using \nintrospective observers well trained in avoiding the \nstimulus error (Titchener himself, or his own graduate students), \nproduced no reports of imageless thoughts. Instead, they found the \nfleeting imagery or the subtle bodily sensations that Professor \nTitchener's theory predicted (Titchener, 1909; Humphrey, 1951).  \n\nThis work of Titchener's (like other responses to the imageless \nthought controversy from America, Britain, and elsewhere) had \nrelatively little impact in Germany, which, with some justification \nat that time, still regarded itself as very much preeminent in \npsychological science. Nevertheless, on both sides of the Atlantic \nthe controversy was recognized as touching on deep foundational \nissues in the science of mind. Although largely forgotten today, it \nseems to have had a lasting impact on the development not only of \npsychology, but philosophy as well. The Würzburg school's \nclaims, despite their shaky basis, undoubtedly contributed to a sense\nthat imagery could not be so psychologically important as had \ntraditionally been assumed, and that an alternative way of thinking \nabout cognitive content was needed. Many psychologists and \nphilosophers of this era came, partly for this reason, to feel that \nthought should be understood in terms of language per se, \nand that it was a serious mistake ever to have believed that the \nrepresentational power of language derives from some more fundamental\nform of representation, such as mental \n imagery.[20] \n\nBut the imageless thought controversy was never satisfactorily\nresolved, at least in the terms in which it was originally posed.\nIndeed, philosophers are still arguing over the issues involved (e.g.,\nLormand, 1996; Mangan, 2001; Pitt, 2004; Robinson, 2005).  Although\nthe Würzburg school has been lauded for drawing psychology's\nattention to the intentionality of mental contents, and for the\nintroduction of once important concepts such as “mental\nset” into the science, it would certainly be grossly misleading\nto suggest that their work provides evidence for the existence of\nnon-sensorial conscious mental contents (i.e. imageless thoughts) that\ncomes anywhere close to meeting present day scientific\nstandards. Indeed, the fact that Külpe's and Titchener's\nlaboratories each produced results that fitted their directors'\ncontrasting preconceptions did not go unnoticed by their\ncontemporaries. The irresolvable dispute contributed significantly to\na growing sense of intellectual crisis within psychology, leading to a\ndeep loss of confidence (persisting to the present – see\nSchwitzgebel (2002a,b, 2008)) in the scientific value of\nintrospection. It also led to a precipitous decline in scientific\ninterest in imagery, especially in the United States after the\nBehaviorist movement took hold. On the one hand its importance in the\ncognitive economy (or even its very existence) was now subject to\ndoubt; on the other hand it had come to seem that it was very\ndifficult, if not impossible, to study it experimentally and\nobjectively.  \n\nFurther discussion of the consequences of the imageless \nthought controversy: \n Supplement: European Responses: Jaensch, Freud, and Gestalt Psychology\n  \n Supplement: The American Response: Behaviorist Iconophobia and Motor Theories of Imagery\n  \n\nBy the early 20th century, particularly in the United States, where \nit most flourished, psychology had progressively established a \ndisciplinary identity distinct from the parent discipline of \nphilosophy. However, interest in and attitudes towards imagery \namongst philosophers followed a very similar trajectory to that seen \nin psychology. Early in the century, philosophers as otherwise \ndiverse as Russell (1919, 1921) and Bergson (1907) still gave imagery\na key role in their theories of meaning and cognition (although it \nmay be significant that Bergson seems to regard what he called the \n“cinematic” imagery-based thought of \n“ordinary” and “intellectual” cognition as \ndistinctly inferior to the non-imaginal philosophical \nintuition that also played a large role in his epistemology). \nHowever, before long, and especially in the wake of the imageless \nthought controversy, doubts were beginning to emerge, in the work of \nphilosophers such as Schlick (1918), Sartre (1936, 1940), Ryle \n(1949), and especially the later Wittgenstein, both about imagery's \nimportance in cognition, and about whether the whole notion of \n“pictures in the mind” really made sense. \n\nIndeed, even in the late 19th century Frege (1884 §§59–60) \nhad already argued against the traditional view that the \nmeaningfulness of language derives from the mental images that we \nassociate with words. Images, he pointed out, are subjective and \nidiosyncratic, whereas word meanings are objective and universal. \nHowever, the almost unanimous scorn with which the imagery theory of \nmeaning was regarded by late 20th century analytic philosophers seems\nmainly to be due to the influence and arguments of the later \nWittgenstein (Candlish, 2001; Nyíri, 2001). Today, it is \nlargely thanks to Wittgenstein's efforts that, \n\nIn fact, Wittgenstein implicitly rejected the imagery theory of \nmeaning even in his early work – the so called “picture \ntheory of meaning” of the Tractatus (Wittgenstein, \n1922) is not a version of the imagery theory – but an \nexplicit critique appears only in his posthumously published later \nwritings (although the arguments were already influential during his \nlifetime, long before they saw print). Perhaps the most sustained \ncritique of the imagery theory of meaning occurs in the opening pages\nof The Blue and Brown Books (Wittgenstein,1958), although \nthe pithier remarks in the Philosophical Investigations \n(1953 – especially §139f) may have been more influential. \nMany other remarks and arguments scattered through Wittgenstein's \nother posthumously published writings, particularly in \nZettel (1967), the Remarks on the Philosophy of \nPsychology (1980a, 1980b), and the Last Writings on the \nPhilosophy of Psychology (1990), demonstrate that he was \nfascinated by imagery, but deeply skeptical not only about the large \ncognitive role traditionally assigned to it, but also about the \ntraditional understanding of the image as a sort of inner picture \n(see, e.g. 1953 I §301, II pp. 196e & 213e).  \n\nNo-one could seriously doubt that Wittgenstein himself recognized the\nexperiential reality and philosophical importance of imagery: he \nexpends so much effort wrestling with the concept. Nevertheless, as \nNyíri (2001) remarks, “Wittgenstein's untiring endeavor \n[is] to relegate mental images to a merely secondary place.” He\ndeterminedly rejected the traditional empiricist view that thinking \nis primarily a play of images, that language is semantically grounded\nin imagery, and that the principal role of language is to communicate\nthe results of our inner, imaginal thought processes to others. \nInstead, Wittgenstein regarded language itself as the preeminent \nvehicle of thought, and he held that the meanings of linguistic \nexpressions arise from the various uses to which they are \nput. He thus saw no need (and no room) for language to be \nsemantically grounded in any other form of representation. In support\nof this position, he strove to show that imagery (the only real \ncandidate for the job) could not possibly be the semantic ground of \nlanguage, and he is very widely believed to have succeeded. \n\nThe two themes of the cognitive unimportance of imagery and its \nnon-pictorial nature were taken up, and argued more fully, by \nnumerous post-Wittgensteinian philosophers in the latter half of the \ntwentieth century. Although there may be some tension between the \nthemes (most arguments against the imagery theory of thought and \nmeaning seem to turn upon mental images being, in some sense, \npicture-like) in practice they have rarely, if ever, come into \nconflict; rather, both have played their part in setting the \niconophobic tone of the era. \n\nEven in the wake of the revival of scientific interest in the\ncognitive roles of imagery in the 1960s and 70s, the handful of\npost-Wittgensteinian philosophers who have attempted to defend\nimagery-based theories of thought and meaning (Price, 1953; Lowe,\n1995, 1996; Ellis, 1995; Nyíri, 2001) still find themselves\nswimming very much against the tide. Philosophers such as Harrison\n(1962–3), Goodman (1968), and Fodor (1975) have reinforced, restated\nand extended Wittgenstein's arguments for the irrelevance of imagery\nto semantics, and have made a powerful and influential case. One point\nthat is often made is that there seems to be no natural way of\nrepresenting certain linguistically expressible concepts in an image.\nLogical relations are often mentioned in this context. It is hard to\nsee, for example, how it might be possible to form a mental image of\nnot (is any image in which John\ndoes not appear an image of John is not here?), or\nor (how would an image of A or B\ndiffer from one of A and B?), or\nif…then (see Barsalou (1999) for some tentative suggestions in rebuttal). \n\nThe image theory of linguistic meaning might seem to be on its \nstrongest ground when it is applied to nouns (or, at least, concrete \nnouns). On the face of things, it is plausible to think that one \nunderstands the meaning of the word 'dog' if and only if as the word \nis able to arouse an image of a dog in one's mind. Berkeley's \nargument against general ideas had long brought this simple picture \ninto question, however (see \n section 2.3.3).\n Can my mental picture of a dog represent any dog, or dogs in general,\nor is it, at best, just a representation of Rover?  \n\nTwentieth century philosophers, however, would soon point to an even \ndeeper problem. They assumed, probably often correctly, that the \ntraditional image theory of meaning was based upon the assumption \nthat images themselves get their meaning through resembling \ntheir objects: an image of a dog represents a dog because it \nresembles or looks like a dog, in the same way that a \npainting of Queen Elizabeth represents Queen Elizabeth because it \nlooks like her. This resemblance theory of \nrepresentation is not always explicitly stated by image \ntheorists of thought and language (perhaps it is thought to be too \nobvious to be worth saying, or perhaps not all of them are really \ncommitted to it), but Russell (1919,1921), for one, explicitly takes \nthe view that words represent because they are associated with mental\nimages, and that the images themselves represent because they \nresemble their objects.  \n\nThis resemblance theory became the main focus of \nattack. Consider a photograph of Leo the lion. It would certainly be \nreasonable to say both that it resembles and that it represents him. \nBut now suppose we have two such photographs. Each photo resembles \nthe other more than either resemble Leo (both photos are small, \nrectangular pieces of card, with a white border around a gray or \nvari-colored rectangle, and neither is carnivorous or furry), yet we \nwould normally want to say that they each represent Leo, and not that\nthey represent each other. Of course, a photograph of Leo does \nresemble him, when the right aspects of resemblance are considered, \nbut in this regard Leo equally resembles the photograph. We are \nunlikely, however, to want to say that he represents the \nphoto. Resemblance is a symmetrical relationship, and representation \nis not. None of this necessarily means that resemblance never plays \nany role in representation, but in order for it to do so, the \nrelevant aspects of resemblance have to be recognized, and \nthe resembling object has to be used (or, at least, \ntaken) as a representation. But surely, before a cognitive \nsystem can recognize or use the relevant aspects of resemblance \nbetween a photograph (or an inner quasi-picture) and an object (or a \npercept), it must already be able to represent the picture and its \nobject, and their various features, to itself. The mind's power to \nrecognize resemblance seemingly depends on its power to represent \nthings, rather than vice-versa. On grounds such as this, Goodman \n(1968) argued that even physical pictures – paintings drawings,\nphotographs, etc. – do not represent their subjects \nbecause they resemble them. Indeed, he held that what a \npicture represents is just as much a matter of interpretation and \nconvention as is what a word or sentence represents, the implication \nbeing that pictorial representation is no more “natural” \nor fundamental, no more a “ground” for meaning, than \nlinguistic representation itself. Clearly the argument applies to \nmental pictures quite as much as to physical ones.  \n\nFodor (1975), borrowing liberally from the Wittgenstein of the \nPhilosophical Investigations (1953 §139 f.), made a \ncompelling case that mental pictures cannot be the foundational \nbearers of intentionality because what they resemble is too \nindeterminate (cf. Goodman, 1970). A mental image of John, who is a \ntall fat man, might mean John, it might mean fat \nman (or John is a fat man), or tall man, or \njust man, human being, or even physical \nobject. On the other hand it might mean John in just the \nparticular pose and situation in which he is imagined. After \nall, it resembles all those things (and indefinitely many more). What\nan image means, according to Fodor, what it is an image of, \nwill necessarily remain radically indeterminate unless it is pinned \ndown by an associated linguistic description. Fodor himself holds \nthat what our mental images represent is determined by an associated \ndescription couched in mentalese, an innate, unconscious, \ncomputational “language of thought” (Fodor, 1975) (see: \n language of thought hypothesis);\n others, such as Kaufmann (1980), apparently think that the necessary \ndescriptions may be couched in the natural language that the imager \nspeaks. On either view, though, the traditional semantic dependency \nis inverted. Instead of the meaningfulness of language being grounded\nin imagery, the meaningfulness of imagery seems to need grounding in \nsome sort of language.  \n\nArguments against the pictorial nature of imagery, which are scarcely\nmore than hinted at in Wittgenstein's published works, were developed\nmuch more explicitly by Ryle (1949). As part of a broader (and very\ninfluential) attack on what he called “Descartes' myth”\n(i.e., Cartesian dualism), Ryle argued that the notion of private,\nnon-physical, mental pictures is an absurdity, and proposed instead\nthat “imagining”, “seeing in the mind's eye”,\nand so forth, is better understood as akin to pretending (to\nourselves) to experience ordinary, external things. Other philosophers\ninfluenced by both Wittgenstein and Ryle soon carried forward this\ncritique of the inner picture: Shorter (1952) and Dennett (1969) (in\nsome respects anticipating the work of Pylyshyn (1973) – see\nsection\n 4.4.1\n below, and especially\n note 31)\n suggested that imagery might be more akin to describing or depicting\nsomething to oneself, rather than to pretending to see it; and, from a\ndetailed exegesis of Ryle's arguments, Ishiguro (1966, 1967) developed\na theory of mental images as intentional objects (in the\nsense of Anscombe (1965)) having a merely “grammatical”\nexistence: Although the grammar of our language may sometimes make it\nvery awkward to refer to our imagery experiences without seeming to\nimply that they are caused by certain entities (mental images), it\ndoes not follow that such entities actually exist. \n\nAlthough expressed in very different terms, Ishiguro's position on \nimagery is not altogether unlike the view developed earlier in the \ncentury by Sartre (1940). (See Ryle (1971) for an interesting \ncomparison of his own views about the mental, including mental \nimagery, to views in the phenomenological tradition, to which Sartre \nbelonged.) Under the influence of Husserl rather than Wittgenstein, \nSartre also stressed the intentionality of imagery and denied that \nmental images (conceived as entities) exist: \n\nIt is important to be clear that just because Sartre (and Ryle, \nShorter, Ishiguro, and others) hold that mental images are not inner \npictures, nor even, indeed, any sort of entity, they are not thereby \ndenying that people have quasi-perceptual experiences, or even that \nthese may sometimes be very vivid. Unfortunately, perhaps because the\nnotion that such experiences are caused by inner pictures is so \nentrenched in our folk psychology, this point does not always seem to\nhave been clear to critics of such views, and it has even been \noccasionally suggested that they could not possibly be held by anyone\npersonally familiar with the experience of \n imagery.[21]\n However, a careful reading of these apparently iconophobic authors \nsoon reveals that they in no way intend to deny the experiential \nreality of imagery, and most of them make their personal familiarity \nwith it quite \n clear.[22]\n They deny only that such experience, however vivid it might be, is \ncaused by (or embodied as) inner pictures. \n\nBy contrast, in his Mental Images – A Defence, Hannay \n(1971) vigorously championed the reality of inner pictures (see also \nHannay, 1973, and for a counterargument see Candlish, 1975). But, \ndespite the fact that he had no thought of reinstating imagery to its\ntraditional importance in cognitive and semantic theory, Hannay \nclearly saw himself (in 1971) as a lonely dissenter, a voice crying \nin the wilderness against philosophy's virtually monolithic \niconophobic consensus. In the subsequent decades that consensus has \nbeen fractured, but by no means shattered, by developments in \ncognitive psychology and cognitive science (discussed below). In \nparticular, in the wake of Kosslyn's (1980, 1994) seminal work on the\ncognitive psychology of imagery, a growing number of philosophers are\nnow ready to defend the reality of mental pictures, and show no sign \nwhatsoever of feeling embattled (e.g., von Eckardt, 1988, 1993; Tye, \n1988, 1991; Mortensen, 1989; Brann, 1991; Cohen, 1996; Rollins, \n2001). Many other philosophers, even if not entirely convinced about \npictures, now take a serious interest in the cognitive science of \nimagery.  \n\nNonetheless, the post-Wittgensteinian consensus that imagery cannot \nbe as important as it once seemed to be, that it cannot be the ground\nof linguistic meaning or the prime vehicle of thought, remains \nstrong. Furthermore, Bennett & Hacker (2003) have recently made a\npowerful restatement of the Wittgensteinian case against mental \nentities in general and mental pictures in particular. Despite all \nthat has happened in cognitive science, imagery has by no means \nregained its former prominence in philosophy.  \n\nA revival of interest in imagery was an important component of the so\ncalled cognitive revolution in psychology during the 1960s \nand early 1970s, a period when the Behaviorist intellectual hegemony \nover the field was broken and the concept of mental \nrepresentation was established as central and vital to \npsychological theorizing (Baars, 1986; Gardner, 1987; but see also \nLeahey, 1992). The first (and formative) textbook of the emerging \ncognitive approach to psychology (Neisser, 1967) devoted substantial \nspace to mental imagery, and the end of the 1960s brought the \npublication of a spate of books reviewing and reporting new findings \non the psychology of imagery: Richardson (1969), Horowitz (1970), \nPaivio (1971), Piaget & Inhelder (1971), Segal (1971a), Sheehan \n(1972). \n\nAlthough the emergence of computational models of mental processes \nprobably played the leading role in the rise of cognitive psychology \nand cognitive science, the new interest in imagery was independently \nmotivated, and contributed significantly to the growing feeling, \namongst psychologists, that both the ontology and methodology of \nBehaviorism were excessively restrictive, and that inner mental \nprocesses and representations could, after all, be useful, or even \nindispensible, scientific concepts. Quite apart from the broader talk\nof revolution in psychology in this era (e.g., Hebb, 1960), there \nseems to have been a real sense, at the time, that the revival of \ninterest in imagery was, in itself, an insurgent movement liberating \npsychologists from entrenched but outworn Behaviorist dogmas. The \nimagery revival was depicted in dramatic terms as “the return \nof the ostracized” (Holt, 1964; cf. Haber, 1970), as “a \ndimension of mind rediscovered” (Kessell, 1972), and as marking\n“a paradigm shift in psychology” (Neisser, 1972b). \n\nHolt (1964) indicates a number of developments that began to lead some \npsychologists, in the 1950s, to begin to pay significant attention to\nimagery again. These include research on hallucinogenic drugs, \ndevelopments in electroencephalography, the discovery of REM sleep \nand its correlation with dreaming, and Penfield's (1958) finding that\ndirect electrical stimulation of certain brain areas can give rise to\nvivid memory (or pseudo-memory) imagery. More significant, however, \n(according to Holt) was a line of psychological research that was \noriginally inspired by practical, rather than theoretical, concerns: \nby the perceptual problems experienced by people such as radar \noperators, long-distance truck drivers, and jet pilots, whose work \nrequires them to remain perceptually alert whilst watching \nmonotonous, impoverished, and barely changing visual stimuli over \nextended periods of time. In the laboratory, subjects experiencing \nsuch sensory deprivation often spontaneously reported vivid, \nintrusive, and sometimes bizarre mental imagery, “like having a\ndream while awake” (Bexton, Heron, & Scott, 1954; but see Suedfeld & Coren, 1989). Despite \nthe introspective nature of the evidence, the practical implications \nof these findings (for such things as road and air safety) made them \nhard to dismiss. \n\nBeginning in the 1960s, and perhaps stimulated by some of the research\nmentioned by Holt, there was also a growing interest in the\napplication of imagery based techniques in psychotherapy and\npsychosomatic medicine (see, e.g., Assagioli, 1965; Horowitz, 1970,\n1983; Korn & Johnson, 1983; Sheikh, 2003). By the 1970s, something\nof a self conscious imagery movement had taken hold, in which\ndiscoveries and theoretical developments coming out of experimental\npsychology and cognitive science helped to fuel and legitimate an\nenthusiasm for the application of imagery to psychotherapy, and even\nto “personal growth,” “consciousness\nexpansion,” and the like.  More recently, imagery based\ntechniques, including, but not limited to, so called “mental\npractice” (Richardson, 1967; Ryan & Simons, 1982;\nNordin et al., 2006), have come to be extensively applied in\nsports psychology, where they are widely believed to have the\npotential to boost athletic performance to a significant degree\n(Paivio, 1985; Sheikh & Korn, 1994; Driskell\net al., 1994; Morris et al., 2005; Short et\nal., 2006; Weinberg, 2008).  A journal dedicated to the subject,\nthe Journal of Imagery Research in Sport and Physical\nActivity commenced online publication in 2006.  Great claims are\nalso made, by some, for the healing powers of\nguided imagery, whereby clients (or patients) are encouraged\nto visualize particular scenes or scenarios thought to have\ntherapeutic value (e.g., Rossman, 2000). Guided imagery techniques\nhave been claimed to be effective for purposes ranging from chronic\npain relief and the preparation of patients for surgery (Fontaine,\n2000; Tusek et al., 1997), to breast enlargement and global\nspiritual renewal (Willard, 1977; Ekstein, 2001)! \n\nIt is sometimes claimed or implied that these sorts of techniques are\nbased upon ancient oriental, and particularly Indian, spiritual \npractices (e.g., Samuels & Samuels, 1975; Gawain, 1982), and it \nthus may not be coincidental that a prominent figure in the \npsychotherapeutic imagery movement is a Pakistani born psychologist, \nAkhter Ahsen, known not only for his clinical and theoretical \nwork (e.g., Ahsen, 1965, 1977, 1984, 1985, 1993, 1999), but also \nbecause he was instrumental, in the later 1970s, in the foundation of\nthe International Imagery Association, and the peer reviewed\nJournal of Mental Imagery (which began publication in 1977).\nThe Association's mission, stated on their web site, is “to \nfurther the understanding of mental imagery and advance its potential\nin the development of human consciousness” (see \n Other Internet Resources).\nThe journal publishes articles on imagery from a wide range of\npsychological perspectives, including the cognitive. An American\nAssociation for the Study of Mental Imagery was also founded in\n1978, with a mission to promote “the study of mental imagery as\na part of human science and the application of scientific knowledge\nabout mental imagery in the relief of human suffering and the\nenhancement of personal development”.  Its\njournal, Imagination, Cognition and Personality, commenced\npublication in the early 1980s. (The Association may now be defunct\n— its web site has disappeared — but the journal continues\nto be published.) \n\nDespite the developments outlined above, interest in imagery amongst \nexperimental psychologists remained at a fairly low level until the \nmid to late 1960s. It was the recognition, in that period, of the \npowerful mnemonic effects of imagery that changed the situation, \nleading to a thriving tradition of experimental research, and \nsecuring imagery a firm place in cognitive theory. These mnemonic \neffects, it turned out, could be clearly demonstrated in readily \nrepeatable experiments that did not rely in any way upon \nintrospective reports. \n\nAccording to Bugelski (1977, 1984), an important stimulus to the \nflowering of experimental research on imagery and \n memory[23]\n was the 1966 publication of Frances Yates' celebrated and widely read\nhistorical study, The Art of Memory. Yates details how \nimagery based mnemonic techniques, particularly versions of the \nso-called method of loci, were in widespread use amongst \nEuropean intellectuals, educators, and orators from classical Greek \nthrough to early modern times, and she argues that the knowledge and \nuse of these techniques may have had quite significant effects on the\ndevelopment of Western philosophical, theological, and early \nscientific thought. (see\nSupplement: Ancient Imagery Mnemonics).\n \n\nAround the same time, Soviet psychologist Alexander Luria's (1960, \n1968) extensive case study of the “mnemonist” \nShereshevskii first became available in English, and well known \namongst English-speaking psychologists. Shereshevskii's truly \nprodigious feats of memory were apparently made possible by an \nabnormally vivid visual imagination, often harnessed to his own \nversion of the method of loci. Experiment soon confirmed \nthat the imagery method of loci, as described by Yates and \nLuria, was extremely effective in enhancing memory performance in \nordinary people (Ross & Lawrence, 1968). \n\nActually, a revival of scientific interest in imagery mnemonics seems\nto have been nascent in North America, even before Yates’ work\nappeared, or Luria’s was translated into English.  According to\nHoffman & Senter (1978) the stimulus came from the tradition of\n“magic shows”, and, particularly, the performances of\n“memory men” (or sometimes “memory women”),\nwho would use traditional mnemonic systems to perform impressive feats\nof memory for entertainment purposes. Some of these “memory\nmen” (or people who had learned from them) also promoted\nmnemonic systems as useful in business, or wrote popularizing books\nthat explained how to use mnemonic techniques, mostly imagery based.\nBooks of this type by Lorayne (1957), Roth (1961), and, especially,\nFurst (1954, 1957) seem to have been amongst those that influenced\npsychologists to take in interest (Hoffman & Senter, 1978; Morris\n& Hampson, 1983).  According to Hoffman & Senter (1978) the\nfirst real scientific study of imagery mnemonics was carried out at\nthe University of Pennsylvania in the late 1950s, by Wallace, Turner,\n& Perkins, who were attempting to explore “the limits of\nhuman information storage”. Turner had formerly worked as a\nstage magician and memory man, and suggested that the subjects be\ntaught an imagery mnemonic technique to help them to realize the full\npotential of their memories. As a result, however, the experiment was\ndeemed a failure; when the subjects used the mnemonic technique, there\nseemed to be no practicably measurable limits to their\ninformation-storage capacity! Because of this, the study was never\npublished, but word of the findings does seem to have got out,\nparticularly via Eugene Galanter, who had also been at the University\nof Pennsylvania at the time. The enormously influential book that he\nco-authored, Plans and the Structure of Behavior includes a\nbrief account of the findings of Wallace, Turner, & Perkins, and\nof the imagery mnemonic they used (Miller, Galanter, & Pribram,\n1960 pp. 136f). This book is considered one of the key, foundational\nworks of the cognitive revolution in psychology, and was enormously\ninfluential in the field (although it is better known for its\nintroduction of concepts from computing and Artificial Intelligence\nresearch into psychology, rather than for its account of imagery\nmnemonics) (Gardner, 1987; Hirst, 1988; Galanter, 1988; Neisser, 1988\np. 85).  \n\nBut, almost certainly, the most important figure in the study of the\nmnemonic effects of imagery was the Canadian psychologist Allan\nPaivio, whose interest in the subject seems to have originated quite\nindependently of any of the influences mentioned so far, going right\nback to 1950, when he witnessed an impressive demonstration of the\npower of an imagery mnemonic, and was taught how to use it, as part of\na course on public speaking that he attended (Paivio, 1991c, 2007\npp. 22-24; Marks, 1997). (The connection between imagery mnemonics and\npublic speaking goes right back to their origins in ancient times: see\n Supplement: Ancient Imagery Mnemonics.) \nDespite this, perhaps because of the still generally iconophobic\ncharacter of North American psychology through the 1950s (see\n Supplement: The American Response: Behaviorist Iconophobia and Motor Theories of Imagery), \nhis first publication to (very tentatively) suggest a role for imagery\nin memory did not appear until 1963 (Paivio, 1963). However, bolder\nclaims and much further experimental work soon followed, and, by the\nend of the decade (by then, no doubt, abetted by awareness of the more\neye-catching historical and anecdotal studies of Yates and Luria)\nPaivio’s theoretical speculations about the central role of\nimagery in memory, and painstaking quantitative experiments with which\nhe supported them, were attracting a great deal of attention. By the\nlater 1960s, and in the 1970s, many other psychologists had taken up\nresearch in this area, but Paivio was well established as the\nfield’s leading figure, and discussion centered largely upon the\nimplications and merits, or otherwise, of the Dual Coding (imagery\ncode and verbal code) theory of mental representation that he proposed\nto explain his results (Paivio, 1971, 1986, 1991a, 1991b, 1995,\n2007). Note, however, that, although they inevitably became entangled,\nthe ensuing controversy between the Dual Coding and the rival Common\nCoding theories of memory (see\n Supplement: Dual Coding and Common Coding Theories of Memory)\n should not be confused with the better known debate\nbetween analog (pictorial) and propositional\n(descriptive) theories of imagery (see\n §4.4). The former debate is about the\nfunction of imagery in cognition, the latter is about the\nnature and mechanism of imagery itself.  \n\nThe findings of this extensive experimental research program on the \nmnemonic effects of imagery, can be crudely summarized as the \ndiscovery of two principal effects. First of all, it was \ndemonstrated quite incontrovertibly that subjects who follow explicit\ninstructions to use simple imagery based mnemonic techniques to \nmemorize verbal material (typically lists of apparently random words,\nor word pairs) remember it very much better than subjects who do not \nuse such techniques (Bower, 1970, 1972; Bugelski, 1970; Paivio, 1971;\nNeisser & Kerr, 1973). Secondly, and somewhat more \ncontroversially, Paivio and others claim to have shown that imagery \nplays a large role in verbal memory even when the experimental \nsubjects are not given explicit instructions to form imagery, and \nmake no deliberate effort to do so. To demonstrate this, Paivio and \nhis associates initially determined quantitative imagery \nvalues for each of a long list of nouns: that is to say, the \nrelative ease with which subjects could generate a mental image \nappropriate to the word, or the likelihood that an image would \nspontaneously be evoked by the word in question (Paivio, Yuille, \n& Madigan, \n 1968).[24]\n (On the whole, concrete nouns such as ‘cat’ have high \nimagery values, and abstract nouns such as ‘truth’ have \nlow ones, although there are exceptions to this rule.) Once these \nquantitative imagery values were established, Paivio was able to \nshow, in various experimental designs, that words with high imagery \nvalues were consistently remembered significantly better than those \nwith lower ones, quite regardless of any conscious intent on the \nsubjects' part to form relevant images (Paivio, 1971, 1983, \n1991a). Much controversy ensued, however, as to whether the\n“imagability” of the referents of the words in question is\nthe truly causally relevant factor, or whether it is some other\nfeature of the words (or their referents) that happens to be well\ncorrelated with this imagery\nvalue.[25] \n\nFurther discussion of theories of the mnemonic properties of \nimagery: \n Supplement: Dual Coding and Common Coding Theories of Memory\n  \n Supplement: Conceptual Issues in Dual Coding Theory\n  \n\nBy the end of the 1960s, the work of Paivio and others on the \nmnemonic properties of imagery had established a strong empirical \ncase for the functional importance of imagery in cognition. The \nphenomenon could no longer be ignored by psychologists, or treated as\na mere subjective epiphenomenon of no scientific interest, as it had \nbeen in the Behaviorist era. However, this work had done very little \nto illuminate the nature of imagery itself, or of the cognitive \nmechanisms that generate it.  \n\nThis began to change in the early 1970s when Roger Shepard and his\nstudents began to publish experimental demonstrations of the\n“mental rotation” of images (e.g., Shepard & Metzler,\n1971; Shepard & Cooper et al., 1982). Soon after, Stephen\nKosslyn and his collaborators produced experimental evidence for the\n“mental scanning” of visual images, showing that it took\nlonger for subjects to consciously scan between image features that\nwere relatively further apart than between those that appeared close\ntogether (Kosslyn, 1973, 1980; Kosslyn, Ball, & Reiser, 1978;\nPinker & Kosslyn, 1978; Pinker, 1980; Finke & Pinker, 1982,\n1983; Pinker, Choate, & Finke, 1984; Borst et al., 2006;\nBorst & Kosslyn, 2008). \n\nKosslyn also demonstrated that the subjective sizes of visual mental \nimages (and the relative sizes of their sub-parts) measurably affect \nthe times it takes to inspect and report on particular details of \nimagined objects. The presence of larger features of an object could \nbe reported more quickly (from an image of the object) than smaller \nfeatures. As this size-time relation, did not appear unless \nthe subjects used imagery to do the task (i.e., to confirm that some \nnamed object type has some particular feature or sub-part), these \nexperiments provided further evidence for the notion that imagery is \na sui generis form of mental representation, with distinct \nproperties from linguistic or purely conceptual representations \n(Kosslyn, 1975, 1976a, 1976b, 1980).  \n\nKosslyn and his associates also claim to have experimentally measured\nthe “visual angle of the mind’s eye”, and to have\nmapped differences in acuity across the “visual field” of\nimagery, just as one can for the real visual field (Kosslyn, 1978a;\nFinke & Kosslyn, 1980; Finke & Kurtzman, 1981a,b; Farah et\nal., 1992). \n\nIt should be noted that the methodology of many of these experiments\nleaves them vulnerable to the charge, pressed by several critics, that\nthe results reflect not so much the normal workings of cognition, and\nthe properties of the representational structures (such as mental\nimages) that enable them, but, rather, what psychologists call the\ndemand characteristics of the experimental situation (Orne,\n1962; Rosnow, 2002)\n (see supplement).\n  This is a well-known pitfall of psychological\nexperimentation with human subjects, and experimenters are, for the\nmost part, well aware of it, and take what precautions they can to\nrule out the possibility that demand characteristics might\nsignificantly influence their findings.  Nevertheless, certain types\nof imagery experiment, including most of those discussed in this\nsection, appear to be particularly susceptible to such influence\n(Intons-Peterson, 1983), and it may sometimes be effectively\nimpossible to rule out the possibility that demand characteristics\nhave played a large, or even predominant, role in determining the\nresults. Thus, some of the results obtained in this area of research\nremain open to question. This is particularly true of the claims to\nhave mapped the “visual angle of the mind’s eye” and\nthe “visual field” of imagery. The demand characteristics\nof these experiments, whose results are not supported by any other,\nconverging, experimental evidence, seem particularly strong, and the\nwork has thus been the target of particularly severe methodological\ncriticism (Intons-Peterson & White, 1981; Banks, 1981; Thomas,\n2014 p. 153). The work has been defended by Finke & Kurtzman\n(1981c; Finke, 1989 ch. 2), and the claims about “visual\nangle” continue to be presented as established fact by Kosslyn\n(1994; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006), but not everyone may be\nconvinced. On the other hand, converging evidence from several\ndifferent types of experiment seems to have been enough to establish a\nconsensus amongst most cognitive scientists that the processes of\nmental scanning, mental rotation, and the size effects in image\ninspection are real and significant components of cognition.   Shepard, Kosslyn, and others argued that these results show that\nvisual mental imagery has inherently spatial properties, and\nrepresents in an “analog” fashion that is quite different\nfrom the way in which language and other symbolic systems represent\n(Shepard & Chipman, 1970; Shepard, 1975, 1978b, 1981; 1984;\nKosslyn, 1975, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1994; Kosslyn, Pinker, Smith, &\nShwartz, 1979; Kosslyn, Thompson & Ganis, 2006). However, others,\nparticularly among those who were strongly committed to a (digital)\ncomputational view of the mind, firmly rejected this conception of\nimagery (Simon, 1972; Anderson & Bower, 1973; Baylor, 1973; Moran,\n1973; Pylyshyn, 1973, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2001, 2002a,b, 2003a,b,c,\n2004, 2007; Hinton, 1979; Slezak, 1995). A lively and high-profile\ntheoretical debate ensued, about the nature of mental imagery and of\nmental representation in general.  \n\nFurther discussion of experiments on the spatial properties \nof imagery:  \n Supplement: Mental Rotation\n  \n Supplement: The Problem of Demand Characteristics in Imagery Experiments\n  \n\nThe analog-propositional debate, occasionally also called \nthe picture-description debate, or sometimes just the \nimagery debate (as if there were no other debatable or hotly\ndebated issues about imagery) is an ongoing and notoriously\nirreconcilable dispute within cognitive science about the\nrepresentational format of visual mental imagery.  The huge impact it\nhad on the early development of the field appears to have resulted in\na widespread belief, amongst both philosophers and cognitive\nscientists, that analog and propositional theories (those terms being\nunderstood in the rather special senses that they have acquired in\nthis context), together, perhaps, with hybrid theories that claim to incorporate\nelements of both (e.g., Tye, 1991; Chambers, 1993), completely exhaust the space\nof possible or empirically plausible scientific accounts of imagery\n(Thomas, 2002). That is not the case, as we shall see\nin section 4.5.\n \nTo a first approximation, the analog side of the debate holds\nthat the mental representations that we experience as imagery are, in\nsome important sense, like pictures, with intrinsically spatial\nrepresentational properties of the sort that pictures have (i.e.,\npictures do not just represent spatial relationships between the\nobjects they depict, but represent those relationships, at least in\npart, via actual spatial relationships on the picture surface). The\npropositional side, by contrast, holds the relevant mental\nrepresentations to be more like linguistic descriptions (of visual\nscenes), without inherently spatial properties of their own. Although\nit began as a dispute amongst scientists, the debate clearly touches\non fundamental issues about the nature of mind and thought, and\nperhaps the nature of science too, so it soon attracted a good deal of\ninterest from philosophers as well.  \n\nIt is good to be aware that the terms analog and \npropositional, although they have become entrenched usage in\nthis context, are both potentially misleading. On the one hand the \npropositions which are supposed by some to constitute the \ndescriptions that constitute imagery, are not really propositions at \nall in the established philosophical sense of the word: rather they \nare a sort of sentence (albeit not sentences natural language, but of\n mentalese).[26]\n On the other hand, the “quasi-pictorial” theory of \nKosslyn (1980, 1983, 1994, 2005), which has become very much the \ndominant theory on the other side of the debate, in fact models \nmental images as digitized pictures generated within a \nsimulation program running on a digital computer (Kosslyn \n& Shwartz, 1977; Kosslyn, \n 1980).[27] \n\nAlthough the debate began, and was at its fiercest, during the\nformative years of the discipline of cognitive science in the 1970s,\nit has yet to reach a generally accepted resolution. Despite Kosslyn's\n(1994) unilateral declaration of victory for the analog side, the\ncontroversy has flared up anew, and continues in the 21st century\n(Slezak, 1995, 2002; Thomas, 1999b, 2002, 2003, 2009; Pylyshyn,\n2002a,b, 2003a,b,c, 2004; Kosslyn, Ganis & Thompson, 2003, 2004;\nKosslyn, 2005; Grueter, 2006; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006;\nDulin et al., 2008; Lewis et al., 2011). The\nBehavioral and Brain Sciences target article by Kosslyn,\nPinker, Smith, & Shwartz (1979), together with the appended\ncommentaries, provides a good sense of the debate at its height, and\nmany of the most important philosophically oriented contributions to\nits early stages can be found in two collections edited by Block\n(1981a,b).  However, it may be difficult to understand the scientific\nand philosophical issues at stake unless one has a sense of the\nhistorical and intellectual context in which the dispute\noriginated.  \n\nMatters became so hotly contested during the 1970s that some \nparticipants, most notably Anderson (1978) and Palmer (1975b, 1978), \ncame to the conclusion that the disagreement was quite impossible to \nresolve by the methods of scientific psychology, or perhaps at all. \nIndeed, Anderson (1978) offered a formal proof purporting to show \nthat the two main contending theories are empirically equivalent. \nAnderson's arguments in particular aroused much interest at the time,\nand were themselves vigorously disputed (Hayes-Roth, 1979; Pylyshyn, \n1979b; Cohen, 1996) and defended (Anderson, 1979). However, the main \ndebate continued, and it is probably fair to say that most observers \nhave come to the conclusion that the empirical equivalence claimed by\nAnderson is ultimately not particularly interesting or important. It \ncan probably be regarded as just a special case of the well known \nDuhem-Quine underdetermination of theory by evidence: many \nphilosophers of science hold that any theory can be made to \nfit any evidence provided one is allowed freely to \nsupplement the theory with arbitrary (and perhaps ad hoc, \ncomplex, and implausible) auxiliary hypotheses, which is essentially \nwhat Anderson was doing. Nevertheless, the fact that such claims \ncould be seriously proposed and discussed is testament to just how \nacrimonious and intractable this debate about imagery had come to \nseem at the time, and how important it was to those involved. The \nvery possibility of a science of cognition seemed to be under threat.\n \n\nDespite this, the debate's focus has, in practice, been quite narrow.\nAlthough it is often understood to be a debate about the nature of\nimagery per se, it may more truly be seen as about what\ntheory of imagery will best account for the facts within the\nparameters of a computational functionalist theory of the mind,\ni.e., a theory that holds that mental states in general are to be\nidentified with states of the brain as individuated in terms of their\ncomputational/functional role in cognition. Although\nthis computational functionalism still has many adherents, it\nno longer dominates the philosophy of mind and cognition to the extent\nthat it once did. However, in the early 1970s it was new and exciting, and\nthe computational approach to cognitive theory that it sanctioned was\nbeing taken up with great enthusiasm by many psychologists (Baars,\n1986; Gardner, 1987). Both the cognitive psychologists and the\nfunctionalist philosophers drew much of their inspiration from\nArtificial Intelligence research in the \"physical symbol\nsystems\" tradition of what Haugeland has called GOFAI (Good Old\nFashioned AI) (Newell, 1981; Haugeland, 1985). \n\nInitially, the concurrent rises of imagery research and computational\npsychology, through the 1960s and into the 1970s, played mutually\nreinforcing roles within the cognitivist revolution against\nBehaviorism, because they both implied that the concept of mental\nrepresentation should play a central role in the science of the\nmind. However, a tension soon became apparent between the symbolic and\nsyntactic concept of mental representation that came from Artificial\nIntelligence and the, on the face of it, very different concept of\nrepresentation implicit in the work of the imagery researchers. The\nanalog-propositional debate, and much of the passion and partisanship\nit aroused, grew out of that tension, and, more particularly, the\ndesire to bring imagery within the fold of computational\nfunctionalism.  \n\nThe analog-propositional debate may be said to have begun when this \ntension found its first clear expression, in a very influential \narticle by Zenon Pylyshyn \n (1973).[28]\n Since then, Pylyshyn has continued to extend and defend his critique \nof pictorial (or analog) theories of imagery in many subsequent \npublications (e.g., Pylyshyn, 1978, 1981,1984, 2002a,b,2003a,b, \n2005). Although a number of other cognitive scientists and \nphilosophers have taken positions, and made empirical and theoretical\narguments, similar to and supportive of those of Pylyshyn (e.g., \nAnderson & Bower, 1973; Reed, 1974; Palmer, 1975a, 1977; Kieras, \n1978; Hinton, 1979; Lang, 1979; Slezak, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, \n2002), and others continue to reject picture theories for different \nreasons (e.g., Neisser, 1979; Heil, 1982; White, 1990; Thomas, 1999b, 2009;\nO'Regan & Noë, 2001; Bartolomeo, 2002; Bennett & Hacker,\n2003; Bartolomeo et al., 2013), Pylyshyn remains,\nindisputably, the best known and most influential critic of pictorial\ntheories of imagery. \n\nClearly Pylyshyn objects, as many philosophers have before him, to \nthe notion of inner mental pictures that are somehow called to mind \nand reperceived by the “mind's eye”. In his 1973 article \nhe raised a number of objections to this notion, some of which have \nwithstood criticism better than others, but the underlying worry was \nclearly that the inner-picture theory of imagery inevitably commits \nthe homunculus fallacy: it implicitly relies on the assumption that \nthere is a little man (or rather, something that is the functional \nequivalent of a full-fledged visual system, including eyes), or, at \nthe very least, something with inexplicable mental powers, \ninside the head to reperceive, experience, and interpret the image. \nThe broad functional architecture of Kosslyn's theory, in fact, \nclosely parallels that of Descartes' account of imagery (see \n section 2.3.1, and\n Supplement: The Quasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery), \n and, of course, Descartes notoriously relied upon a\nconscious homunculus, the immaterial soul, that is placed forever\nbeyond the reach of natural science. Modern defenders of the\npictorial/analog theory protest that they cannot have committed the\nhomunculus fallacy (let alone committed themselves to Cartesian\ndualism) because a computer model of the theory has been implemented,\nand they have outlined an account of how picture-like\nrepresentations, formed at an early stage of visual processing in the\nbrain, are subject to several more stages of neural processing before\nthey give rise to visual knowledge and experience (Kosslyn, 1980,\n1994; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2002, 2006).  \n\nHowever, their critics remain unconvinced that they have truly even\nrecognized this pitfall, let alone successfully avoided it (Slezak,\n1993, 1995; Thomas, 1999b, 2002, 2003, 2009; Pylyshyn, 2002a,b,\n2003a,b,c, 2004, 2007). For instance, the computer simulation just\nmentioned (Kosslyn & Shwartz, 1977, 1978; see also Kosslyn, Flynn,\net al., 1990) can do without a homunculus only because the\nrole of the homunculus is filled for it by the full-sized humans who\nprogram and operate the computer, and who see, and so consciously\nexperience, the “images” that it outputs to its VDU\nscreen. What the program actually does is construct and display a\npicture on the computer's screen, on the basis of a stored file,\nand then move it about on the screen in various ways, in order to\nmodel some of the ways in which people can supposedly manipulate their\nmental images (such as in mental rotation and mental scanning). These\n“images” are conscious only if, and inasmuch as, a\nconscious person sees then on the screen. (The pictures, of which only\ntwo examples were actually programmed into the system, were, in fact,\nquite crude “ASCII art”: for an example of one of the\npictures, and a more detailed account of the program and its\ncapabilities, see Supplement: The\nQuasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery, and its Problems, particularly\nfigure 2 and its accompanying explanation.) At the time when the\nprogram was written, when computer graphics were in their infancy, and\nwhen few people had ever even seen a computer, it may not have been an\nentirely unimpressive achievement. However, nothing in the program\n(nor, so far as I am aware, in any computer simulation of a pictorial\ntheory of imagery written since) implements, or even attempts in any\nway to simulate or model, a conscious awareness of the\npictures. Kosslyn & Shwartz (1977) mention that they hope, one\nday, to add a “mind’s eye” function to their\nsimulation, to “look at” the image within the computer, as\nit were, but, unsurprisingly (given how difficult an AI problem\nnaturalistic computer vision turned out to be (Brooks, 1992, 1999)),\nthis was never done. Arguably, given their assumptions about the\nessentially passive nature of the earliest stages of vision, it never\ncould be (Thomas, 2009, 2014 §5). \n\nAs consciousness, nothing in the Kosslyn & Shwartz simulation even\npretends to correspond to a grasp of what it is that the pictures that\nit produces represent (or even that they are supposed to be\nrepresentations). Only the human onlooker consciously experiences the\npictures, knows that they are pictures, and can tell what\nthey might be pictures of (Thomas, 2009). If quasi-pictorial theory\nwere capable of accounting for the representational and conscious\nnature of imagery without appealing to a homunculus, then the\nKosslyn-Shwartz program might constitute a heuristically useful (if\ncrude and preliminary) model of how images might be built up and\ntransformed. However, despite vehement claims to the contrary (e.g.,\nKosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006 p. 41), the existence of the\nprogram in no way shows that the theory can avoid making the appeal to\na homunculus. \n\nIn a subsequent paper, Pylyshyn (1978) introduced an important new\nargument against pictorialism, based on the concepts (which he\nintroduced) of cognitive penetrability\nand impenetrability. The distinction between cognitively\nimpenetrable and cognitively penetrable processes closely parallels\nFodor's later distinction between modularized and unmodularized,\n“central” cognitive systems (Fodor, 1983).  Cognitive\nprocesses are said to be cognitively penetrable if their workings can\nbe affected by the beliefs and goals of the person, and cognitively\nimpenetrable if they cannot be. Pylyshyn argues (and Fodor (1983)\nconcurs) that there are good reasons to believe that\n“early” visual processing, i.e., the processes by which\nvisual inputs give rise to beliefs about our surroundings, is\ncognitively impenetrable. For example, he points out that\nwell known visual illusions, such as the Ponzo and Müller-Lyer\nillusions, continue to deceive us even when we know perfectly well\nthat they are illusions (figure 4.4.1_1). The two horizontal\nlines in both the Ponzo and the Müller-Lyer figures continue to\nlook as though they are of different lengths even when we \nhave measured them and are quite convinced that they are, in fact, \nthe same. \n\n  \nFigure 4.4.1_1 The Ponzo Illusion (left) and \nthe Müller-Lyer Illusion (right).  In both cases, the two \nhorizontal lines are the same length, but appear to be different \nlengths.  \n\nAs Pylyshyn sees it, the view that he rejects, the view that visual \nmental imagery involves a representational format that is peculiarly \nvisual and is distinct from the format in which beliefs and \npropositional attitudes in general are represented, amounts to the \nclaim that images are generated within this cognitively impenetrable,\n“early visual processing” module. If that were the case, \nimagery should be a cognitively impenetrable phenomenon, but it is \n not.[29]\n The way we experience our mental imagery is clearly affected by our \nbeliefs and goals. Not only do we have a large degree of voluntary \ncontrol over the content of our imagery experiences, but it has also \nbeen experimentally demonstrated that extra-visual beliefs can \ninfluence the course of supposed imagery processes. For example, the \ntimes taken to “mentally scan” between different \nlandmarks on a mental image of a map (see section 4.3 above) are \naffected not only by the actual relative distances between the points\non the map, but also by information that is verbally given about \nthose distances. Subjects tend to take longer to “mentally \nscan” over a distance marked as representing 80 miles than over\na distance marked as 20 miles, even though the actual distances \ndepicted on the map (which they have learned and are supposedly \nimagining) are the same (Richman, Mitchell, & Reznick, 1979a,b; \nsee also Mitchell & Richman, 1980; Goldston et al., \n1985; Reed, Hock & Lockhead, 1983). \n\nPylyshyn's views about the cognitive impenetrability of “early \nvision”, the relevance of this to our understanding of imagery,\nand the concept of cognitive penetrability/impenetrability itself, \nall remain controversial (see, for example, the commentaries \npublished with Pylyshyn (1999)), but he has continued to develop and \nrefine the concept (which also has applications outside the imagery \ndebate), as well as the associated argument, over many years (e.g., \nPylyshyn, 1984, 1999, 2002a, 2002b, 2003b). \n\nPylyshyn also argues (1981, 2002a) that most if not all of the \nexperimental evidence that is supposed to show that imagery has \ninherently spatial properties (such as Kosslyn's work on mental \nscanning (Kosslyn, Ball, & Reiser, 1978; Kosslyn, 1980)) can be \nexplained away as the result of the interaction of the experimental \nsubject's tacit knowledge of the properties of visual \nexperience and the experimental instructions. For instance, he holds \nthat if subjects are asked to scan their mental gaze from one point to\nanother on a mental image of a map, what they interpret these \ninstructions to be asking them to do is to behave as if they were \nactually looking at the relevant map and scanning their gaze between \nthe points. Because they know from their history of ordinary visual \nexperience that it takes longer to scan between points that are \nfurther apart, this will be reflected in their performance. Thus, the\nfact that people instructed to scan across their images take longer \nto scan longer distances is not evidence of the existence of some \ninner, mental, image-space. Rather, it is a reflection of people's \nimplicit understanding (which they may not necessarily always be able\nto articulate) of the visual properties of the actual space around \nthem (cf, Morgan, 1979). \n\nPylyshyn's critics have often been inclined to conflate his tacit\nknowledge theory with the view that the results of imagery \nexperiments may be fatally contaminated by the effects of \nexperimental demand characteristics (see\n supplement).\n  However, although he clearly does think experimental demand plays a\nlarge role in determining many of the results on imagery, he resists\nthis interpretation of his position. He is not saying (as is sometimes\nimplied) that experimental subjects are, as it were, consciously\nfaking their performances in order to please the experimenter. Rather\nthey are doing their best to comply with experimental instructions\nthat turn upon the slippery concept of mental imagery. The fact that\nthe subjects and the experimenter may share similar assumptions about\nthe causes of quasi-visual experience (the “folk theory”\nof images as inner pictures), so that both interpret the experiment in\nterms of operations on inner pictures in an inner space, is not\nevidence that those assumptions are correct. It is generally assumed\nthat problems caused by demand characteristics can be avoided or\nminimized by careful and ingenious experimental design, or by such\ntactics as post-experimental questioning of subjects to see if they\nhave guessed the experimental hypothesis (Kosslyn, for one, routinely\nthrows out data from subjects who guess this correctly). However,\nPylyshyn is not saying that what might otherwise be meaningful\nexperimental results are “contaminated” by the effects of\ndemand characteristics, so such “decontamination” tactics\nare not very relevant. Rather, the problem lies with the basic\nconceptualization of the phenomena and the experimental tasks (by\nexperimenter and subject alike). \n\nOf course, Pylyshyn was far from the first person to raise objections\nto the idea of inner pictures, or to criticize the standard \ninterpretations of imagery experiments. What made his critique \nparticularly effective was that he began, both in his 1973 article \nand in subsequent writings (e.g., Pylyshyn, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2003b),\nto sketch out an alternative, non-pictorial account of the nature of \nmental imagery. Instead of being like pictorial representations of a \nvisual scene, he suggested, images might better be thought of as \nbeing a sort of description (sometimes referred to as a \n“structural description”) of that scene. At last, there seemed to be a viable\nalternative to the pictorial conception of imagery that had dominated\nfolk, philosophical, and psychological thinking about imagery since \nancient \n times.[30]\n Philosophers such as Shorter (1952) and Dennett (1969) (who both base\ntheir position on the oft repeated, but almost certainly unsound,\nargument from image indeterminacy, or “tiger's stripes” argument) had\nanticipated Pylyshyn in suggesting that mental images might be more\nlike descriptions than\n pictures.[31]\n  However, Pylyshyn was able to make the idea much more concrete and\nplausible by linking it with concepts of the nature of mental\nrepresentation that were emerging from Artificial Intelligence\nresearch.  Particularly important for Pylyshyn was the work of Simon\n(1972) and Newell (1972), and their students Baylor (1973) and Moran\n(1973), who had already made some progress in devising symbol systems\nsuitable for the computational representation of the spatial structure\nof simple layouts or objects (such as rectangular blocks). They\nexplicitly presented these representations as models of the image\nrepresentations that people use in doing certain visuo-spatial\ncognitive\n tasks.[32]\n By presenting these ideas as the germ of\nan alternative to the venerable but highly problematic conception of\nimages as inner pictures, Pylyshyn was able to make a powerful\ncase. \n\nIn his original (1973) article, Pylyshyn alludes to a number of \ndisparate schemes developed by various computer scientists, for the \ncomputational representation of visual information, and it is perhaps\nnot altogether clear what these have in common as alternatives to a \npictorial conception of imagery. This was very much clarified, \nhowever, when Fodor (1975) introduced the hypothesis of \nmentalese, the “language of thought” (see \n Language of Thought Hypothesis),\n a syntactically structured representational system innate to the \nhuman brain, which Fodor argued, was, in some form, implicitly \nrequired by all coherent computational functionalist theories of \ncognition. The vocabulary and syntax of mentalese (if it exists) \nremain unknown, but they are likely to be very different from those \nof English or any other natural (actually spoken) language. \nNevertheless, Fodor holds that any cognitive theory capable of \naccounting for the full range of human mental capacities is bound to \nmake appeal to some such inner language. Pylyshyn has embraced this \nhypothesis (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988), and, in the light of that, \nwe can say that his view of the nature of imagery is that it consists\nof descriptions, in mentalese, of visual objects or scenes. (This \nmeans, of course, that Pylyshyn's positive view of imagery – \ndescription theory – is viable only if the controversial \nlanguage of thought hypothesis is true. However, many of \nPylyshyn's objections to pictorial theories of imagery might still \nstand even if this were not the case.)  \n\nFodor did not, however, embrace Pylyshyn's objections to \npictorial mental imagery. Although he holds that pictorial \nrepresentations are not sufficient to support cognition on \ntheir own, and are probably dependent on associated mentalese \nrepresentations for playing any cognitive roles that they do play, he\nnevertheless argues against some philosophical objections to mental \n pictures,[33]\n and thinks that the empirical evidence (from psychologists such as \nPaivio and Shepard) suggests that images do in fact play a real role \nin our cognitive processes (Fodor, 1975 pp.174–194). \n\nIt is sometimes objected that a description theory, like Pylyshyn's, \nis incompatible with the phenomenology of imagery (e.g., Fodor, 1975 \np. 188). After all, having a mental image of a cat does not seem \nanything like reciting a description of a cat to oneself. However, \nthis seems to be based on having drawn too close an analogy between \nthe mentalese descriptions intended by the theory and descriptions in\nEnglish (or other natural languages). In the first place, although we\ncan be conscious of English sentences as such, we are (pretty much \nex hypothesis) never conscious of our mentalese \nrepresentations as such, but only (at most) of what they represent. \nThus there is no reason to expect that entertaining a mentalese \ndescription would subjectively seem anything at all like reciting, or\nreading, or otherwise thinking of a description in English. In the \nsecond place, Pylyshyn presumably holds (quite consistently with mainstream \n“information processing” theories of perception (e.g., \nMarr, 1982)) that percepts, the end products of visual processing in \nthe brain, are also mentalese descriptions. Thus his theory readily \naccounts for the phenomenological similarity between imagery and \nperceptual experience. (If, as seems likely, the perceptual \ndescriptions are typically more detailed than those of imagery, this \nmight also account for any phenomenological \ndifferences between imagery and perception.) \n\nThis introspectively based argument against description theory, weak\nthough it is, is often prelude to the even stronger claim that the\nphenomenology of imagery directly supports the view that mental images\nare inner pictures. After all, it is said, in contrast to\nreciting a description to oneself, having a mental image of (say) a\ncat does seem very much like seeing a picture of a\ncat. Although some people seem to find this argument tempting (e.g.,\nSterelny, 1986; Lewis et al., 2011), it does not stand up to\nmuch examination (Block,1983a; Tye, 1991; Thompson, 2007). There is\nlittle or nothing to the alleged similarity between the experience of\nhaving a mental image of a cat and that of seeing a picture of a cat,\napart from the fact that both these experiences in some ways resemble\nthe experience of actually seeing a cat, and both differ from\nit in that no cat need actually be present. Pictures and mental images\nalso differ in important ways. It is generally possible, for instance,\nto turn over a picture and look at its blank backside, to examine its\nsurface for marks (such as scratches or dirt) that do not have a\ndepictive role, or to look at its flat surface from an oblique angle\nso that what it depicts appears distorted. You cannot do such things\nwith a mental image. (You can of course, imagine looking at a picture\nin those ways, but then you are not turning over your mental image in\nyour mind, or looking at its surface, rather, you are forming an image\nof a picture being turned over, of the back of the picture, or an\nimage of a picture’s surface as seen in a certain way.)  It is true\nthat pictures (paintings, drawings, photographs, videos, etc.) provide\na familiar and relatively well understood example of how we can have\nan experience as of seeing something that is not actually\npresent. Indeed, pictures (and sculptures) may be our only familiar\nexample of this, apart from mental imagery itself. However, it does\nnot follow that mental images must therefore be a species of\npicture. The easy analogy may be a false one. Mental images, after\nall, are not similar to pictures in many other respects: you\ncannot turn them over and look at the back of them; they do not need\nto be in front of your eyes for you to see them; they do not normally\nseem to be located on a surface; and there is little reason to think\nthat they are normally flat (and, indeed, good reason, experimental as\nwell as introspective, to think otherwise (Shepard & Metzler,\n1971; Pinker & Kosslyn, 1978; Pinker, 1980; Pinker &\nFinke,1980; Kerr, 1987)).  \n\nIn fact, neither Paivio nor Shepard, who were undoubtedly the best \nknown imagery researchers at the time Pylyshyn published his initial \n(1973) critique, were committed to the straightforward picture theory\nof imagery that he seemed to be criticizing. Paivio, in response to \nPylyshyn, quite explicitly rejected the picture metaphor (and related\nones, such as the photograph and the wax impression), and suggested, \ninstead, that imagery is “a dynamic process more like \nactive perception than a passive recorder of \nexperience” (Paivio, \n 1977).[34]\n (Unfortunately, however, that is about as explicit as he ever gets \nabout his positive view of the nature of imagery.) Shepard, although \nhe continued to write about the “analog” nature of image \nrepresentations, and to insist on the “second order \nisomorphism” between objects and the brain processes that \nconstitute mental images of them (Shepard, 1975, 1978b, 1981, 1984), \nwas also very wary of the picture metaphor, suggesting instead that \nimagery was related to perceptual anticipation or readiness to \nrecognize (Shepard, 1978b; cf. Cooper, 1976). \n\nTwo other important early critics of Pylyshyn's position were Ulric \nNeisser and Ronald Finke. Neisser developed the notion of imagery as \nperceptual readiness or anticipation into a theory of imagery \nexplicitly opposed to both the picture and description theories \n(Neisser, 1976, 1978a, b; 1979 – see section 4.5 below). \nFinke's experimental work on visual illusions and aftereffects \ninduced by imagery (Finke, 1979, 1989 ch. 2; Finke & Schmidt, \n1977, 1978) suggested that Pylyshyn was wrong to argue that imagery \ndoes not make use of the “cognitively impenetrable” \nmechanisms of “early” visual \n processing,[35]\n and he argued that there is evidence for functional equivalences \nbetween imagery and perception (i.e., shared mechanisms) at multiple \nlevels or stages of perceptual processing (Finke, 1980, 1985, 1986, \n1989). \n\nNeither Paivio nor Shepard, nor, indeed, Neisser, shared the \nassumptions of the computational functionalist framework from within \nwhich Pylyshyn was arguing: Paivio developed a metatheoretical \nframework that remained rooted in Behaviorist empiricism, and which \nhe called “neomentalism” or “behavioral \nmentalism” (1975c, 1986); Shepard speculated about the neural \nbasis of imagery in a style reminiscent of the speculative \nneuroscience of Gestalt field \n theory[36]\n (Shepard, 1981, 1984); and Neisser aligned himself with the \necological psychology of J.J. Gibson (1966, \n 1979).[37]\n In this regard, Pylyshyn was much more in step than they were with \nthe direction in which cognitive science was going at the time. \nHowever, Stephen Kosslyn soon intervened in the debate, proposing a \ntheory of visual imagery that was both explicitly computational and \novertly pictorialist (or, as he prefers, quasi-pictorial), \nbased on an analogy with computer graphics programs (which were a \nfairly new thing back then) (Kosslyn, \n 1975).[38]\n Before long, a flood of theoretical and empirical publications from \nKosslyn and his collaborators, including several books (Kosslyn, \n1980, 1983, 1994; Kosslyn & Koenig, 1992), had established him as\nclearly the pre-eminent figure of the debate, alongside Pylyshyn. As \nthe leading figures on each side were now both firmly wedded to the \ntheoretical framework of computational \n functionalism,[39]\n the debate's scope was, in practice, greatly narrowed by this \ndevelopment, even as its intensity and contentiousness (and \nnotoriety) grew. It developed not into an open ended inquiry into the\nnature and causes of imagery, but a manichean struggle between the \ncomputational pictorialism championed by Kosslyn and his supporters, \nand the computational description theory still most ably and \nenthusiastically represented by Pylyshyn.  \n\nIn what remains one of the most effective critiques of Pylyshyn's\nposition, Kosslyn & Pomerantz (1977; see also Kosslyn, 1980 ch.\n1), besides going point-by-point through Pylyshyn's original (1973)\narguments, and answering many of them very persuasively, go on to\ncompare how a description theory and a quasi-pictorial theory like\nthat proposed by Kosslyn (1975) might respectively explain various\nalleged “imagery effects” such as mental rotation,\nselective interference, and the mental scanning and size/inspection\ntime effects discovered by Kosslyn himself. (It ought to be noted,\nhowever, that this discussion largely depends on the speculative\nascription of straw-man accounts of these, at the time newly\ndiscovered, effects to Pylyshyn, or to description theorists in\ngeneral. In fact, Pylyshyn’s actual, subsequently published, account\nof mental scanning, for example (Pylyshyn, 1981, 2002a), does not\nresemble the straw-man set up by Kosslyn & Pomerantz in the least;\nneither, so far as I am aware, has any other theorist ever seriously\ndefended anything remotely resembling it. Despite this, Kosslyn has\ncontinued to set up and knock down this same straw-man, as a\ncenterpiece of his critique of “propositional theory”, in\nsubsequent writings (e.g., Kosslyn, 1994 pp. 8 & 12; Kosslyn,\nThompson, & Ganis, 2006 p. 28)). The general conclusion reached by\nKosslyn & Pomerantz was that description (propositional) theories\ncould only explain these effects by making ad hoc auxiliary\nassumptions about how the propositional (mentalese) code is organized\nand processed, whereas the explanations of quasi-pictorial theory flow\nnaturally from the core theory itself.  Indeed, they pointed out, it\nwas pictorial conceptions of imagery, not “propositional”\nones, that had suggested to psychologists that these effects might\nexist, and that it would be worthwhile devising experiments to confirm\nthem. Pictorial theories had shown themselves to be scientifically\nfruitful in a way that description theories had not. \n\nOn the face of things, description theory predicts that imagery \nshould depend upon the mechanisms and brain structures that subserve \nconceptual, non-imaginal thought, and not those that subserve \nperception. Indeed, one of Pylyshyn's favorite arguments against \npictorial images turns on his view that perception (but not imagery) \ndepends upon a “cognitively impenetrable,” highly \nmodularized cognitive system (see\n section 4.4.1).\n  Thus it can be (and has been) argued that it is difficult, or at the\nleast very awkward, for the description theorist to account for a\nwealth of empirical findings from neuroscience research that indicate\nthat there is a good deal of overlap between the neural structures and\ncognitive mechanisms involved in imagery and those involved in\nperception (Kosslyn, 1994, 2005; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006;\nKosslyn & Thompson, 2003; Bartolomeo, 2002; Kosslyn, Ganis, &\nThompson, 2001; Kreiman, Koch, & Freid, 2000; Bisiach & Berti,\n1990; Farah, 1988). Although a strong case can be made that (despite\nsuperficial appearances) these neuroscientific findings\ndo not provide strong evidence in favor of the\nquasi-pictorial (or any other pictorial) theory of imagery (Thomas, 1999b; Abell &\nCurrie, 1999; Pylyshyn, 2002a,b, 2003a,b; Bartolomeo, 2002), it does not\nfollow that description theory can readily assimilate them.  \n\n(Incidentally, although it was once widely believed that visual \nimagery in humans was primarily a function of the right \nhemisphere of the brain (e.g., Ley, 1983), more recent research \ncontradicts this. It now appears that imagery involves structures on \nboth sides of the brain, with, if anything, the left \nhemisphere playing a slightly more extensive role (Ehrlichman & \nBarrett, 1983; Farah, 1984, 1995; Sergent, 1990; Tippett, 1992; \nTrojano & Grossi, 1994; Loverock & Modigliani, 1995; \nMichimata, 1997).) \n\nAs well as having continued to duel with Pylyshyn and other critics,\nKosslyn has continued to develop his quasi-pictorial theory of\nimagery, initially as a computational model (Kosslyn & Shwartz,\n1977, 1978; Kosslyn, Pinker, Smith, & Shwartz, 1979: Kosslyn,\n1980, 1981), and latterly as a neurological one (Kosslyn, 1988, 1994,\n2005; Kosslyn, Ganis, & Thompson, 2001; Kosslyn, Thompson, &\nGanis, 2006). He calls the theory\nquasi-pictorial, to avoid the implication that he thinks \nimages are pictures in too literal and implausible a sense. \nQuasi-pictures are not the sort of thing that can be hung on a wall \n(Kosslyn, 1978b), and you do not need actual eyes inside the head \nlooking at them in order to experience them. Nevertheless, they \nremain like pictures in many important respects. It remains \ncontroversial whether there can be a coherent notion of a \nquasi-picture that both retains the explanatorily useful properties of\ntrue pictures (such as their inherent spatiality, and their capacity \nto cause visual experiences as of what they represent) and, at the \nsame time, lacks those properties that make it impossible for true \npictures to be mental, or even neural, representations (such as \nneeding to be illuminated and before our eyes in order to be \nexperienced). \n\nIt is clearly Pylyshyn's opinion that there is no such notion, and \nthat much of the superficial plausibility of quasi-pictorial theory \ndepends upon an equivocation between the relatively well understood \nconcept of a picture in the everyday sense, and the essentially \nnon-pictorial notion of an array data structure (Pylyshyn, 1981, \n2002a, 2003b). The literal picture in the head theory appeals to our \nfolk-theoretical intuitions, makes interesting predictions, and has \nthe resources to be genuinely explanatory, but it is demonstrably \nfalse. On the other hand, the data-structure theory (to which \nquasi-pictorialists retreat when literal pictorialism is challenged) \nis really just a version of Pylyshyn's own description theory, and, \nproperly understood, has none of the special intuitive, explanatory, \nor predictive advantages that picture theorists claim for their \nviews. Any apparent similarity between pictures and two-dimensional \narray data structures is, according to Pylyshyn, no more than an \nartifact of the way we customarily present such arrays on paper (or \nscreen) for the benefit of human eyes. It has nothing to do with \ntheir actual mathematical properties, or with how they might function\nin cognition. \n\nDespite Pylyshyn's criticisms, however, many philosophers have \nclearly been impressed by Kosslyn's work. Some have directly defended\nthe quasi-pictorial theory of imagery, attempting to clarify the \nnotion of a quasi-picture, and to show that it has real content (von \nEckardt, 1984, 1988, 1993; Tye, 1988, 1991; Cohen, 1996). Others are \nmore circumspect, or less committed to the specifics of Kosslyn's \ntheory, but are now persuaded to countenance the possibility of \npicture-like mental representations of some sort (e.g. Sober, 1976; \nBlock, 1981a, 1981b, 1983a, 1983b; Bower, 1984; Sterelny, 1986; \nRollins, 1989, 2001; Mortensen, 1989; Dennett, 1991; Brann, 1991). \nYet others, however, for reasons discussed in the previous section \n(and the following supplement), remain entirely unpersuaded (e.g., \nHeil, 1982, 1998; White, 1990; Slezak, 1993, 1995, 2002; Thomas, \n1997a, 1999b, 2002, 2003, 2009; Bennett & Hacker, 2003).  \n\nFurther discussion of the analog-propositional debate:   \n\nReading most of the recent philosophical literature on imagery (and, \nit must be admitted, most of the broader cognitive science \nliterature, especially textbooks) one might easily form the \nimpression that quasi-pictures and \"propositional\" \ndescriptions are the only possible theoretical models for imagery, \nor, at least, the only ones ever seriously proposed or considered. \nThis is not the case, however.The analog-propositional debate arose, \nand was at its height, in the 1970s, when cognitive theories based \nupon symbolic computation seemed to many to be “the only game \nin town” in cognitive science (Fodor, 1975; Haugeland, 1978), \nand the quasi-pictorial and propositional models are both products of\nthis mileu. Even in the 70s, however, a number of alternative, \nnon-computational accounts of imagery were being put forward. On the \none hand, Taylor (1973) and Skinner (1974) looked for ways to \nassimilate imagery into Behaviorism. On the other, several cognitive \npsychologists suggested versions of what may be called \nenactive (or sensorimotor, or perceptual \n activity)[40]\n imagery theories (Hochberg, 1968; Hebb, 1968, 1969; Gibson, 1970, \n1979; Juhasz 1969, 1972; Sarbin & Juhasz, 1970; Sarbin, 1972; \nNeisser, 1976, 1978a, \n b).[41]\n Although this work had little impact at the time, more recently, \nspurred by related developments in perceptual theory, there has been \nsome revival of interest in theories of this type.  \n\nEnactive theories of imagery may be seen as modern successors to the \nmotor theories of the early twentieth century (see \n Supplement: The American Response: Behaviorist Iconophobia and Motor Theories of Imagery).\nThey depend the idea that perception is not mere passive\nreceptivity (or even receptivity plus inner processing), but a form of\naction, something done by the organism (Thomas 1999b, 2014\n§5; O’Regan & Noë, 2001; Findlay & Gilchrist,\n2003; Noë 2004, 2009; Land & Tatler, 2009; O’Regan,\n2011). The perceiving organism is not merely registering but exploring\nand asking questions of its environment (Ellis, 1995),\nactively and intentionally (though not necessarily with conscious\nvolition) seeking out the answers in the sensory stimuli that surround\nit.[42] Imagery is\nthen experienced when someone persists in acting out the seeking of\nsome particular information even though they cannot reasonably expect\nit to be there. We have imagery of, say, a cat, when we go through\n(some of) the motions of looking at something and determining that it\nis a cat, even though there is no cat (and perhaps nothing relevant at\nall) there to be seen. Visually imagining a cat is seeing\nnothing-in-particular as a cat (Thomas, 1999b, 2003, 2009;\ncf. Ishiguro, 1967). \n\nFarley (1974, 1976) developed a computer simulation inspired by \nHochberg's version of enactive theory, and Hampson & Morris \n(1978, 1979; Morris & Hampson, 1983) discussed and critiqued \nNeisser's version (which was undoubtedly the most detailed). However,\nwith those exceptions, in the 1970s and 80s the enactive approach to \nimagery attracted very little attention. It was not just that these \nnon-computational theories seemed irrelevant to psychologists and \nphilosophers whose focus was on integrating imagery into the \nprevalent (symbolic, GOFAI (Haugeland, 1985)) computational model of \nthe mind. More specifically, the enactive theories do not fit \ncomfortably, if at all, into the framework of computational \ninformation processing theory that shaped most scientists' \nthinking about perception and perceptual experience. Information \nprocessing theories come in many varieties, but they all, broadly \nspeaking, depict the sense organs as passive transducers of stimulus \nenergies (light, sound, etc.), whose outputs are then computationally\nprocessed and enriched, in the brain, into meaningful mental \nrepresentations (Lindsay & Norman, 1972; Haber, 1974; Frisby, \n1979; Marr, 1982; Pylyshyn, \n 2003b; Boothe, 2002).[43]\n Kosslyn's quasi-pictorial theory and Pylyshyn's description theory of\nimagery were both designed to fit this framework. They differ merely \nin that Kosslyn holds that the representations comprising imagery are\nformed at an early stage of visual processing, whereas Pylyshyn holds\nthat they are formed at a late stage. This difference, however, gave \nrise to the impassioned analog-propositional debate, whose sound and \nfury only served to further distract attention from theoretical \nalternatives that did not fit the information processing \n paradigm.[44] \n\nBut it is well known that GOFAI style symbolic computationalism did \nnot remain the “only game in town” in cognitive science \nfor long. Since the mid 1980s its hegemony has been repeatedly \nchallenged, first by connectionism (e.g., Rumelhart, McClelland et \nal., 1986; Clarke, 1989), then by various versions of situated or \nembodied approaches to cognition (e.g., Varela et al., 1991;\nSmith, 1991; Clancey, 1997; Clark, 1997), by dynamical systems theory\n(e.g., Freeman & Skarda, 1990; Port & van Gelder, 1995; van \nGelder, 1995; Garson, 1996), and by cognitive neuroscience (e.g., \nKosslyn & Koenig, 1992; Gazzaniga, 2004). \n\nConnectionism did not challenge the information processing view of\nperception, however, and thus proved of little significance for\nimagery theory, inspiring little more than a handful of variants of\nquasi-pictorial array theory (Julstrom & Baron, 1985; Mel, 1986,\n1990; Stucki & Pollack, 1992). The robotic system Murphy,\ndesigned by Mel (1990), has some interesting features in that it\ncombines such a connectionist model of visual imagery with a model of\ntrial-and-error learning of motor control, wherein information in the\nputative image is used to control the reaching behavior of a robotic\narm (although it is not obvious that imagery, as distinct from visual\nperception, plays any such role in human reaching). Grush (2004)\nadopts this model as the basis of his own account of visual mental\nimagery, within the wider context of his “emulation”\ntheory of cognition. Nevertheless, Mel and Grush continue to conceive\nof the image itself as being a two dimensional array of elements, just\nas the quasi-pictorial theory of Kosslyn does, and, indeed, in support\nof their models both Mel and Grush follow Kosslyn in appealing to\nevidence about the spatial properties of imagery and about the\ninvolvement of visual areas of the brain in imagery. Thus, despite the\nfact that Mel and Grush situate their accounts of imagery in the\ncontext of motor control rather than of visual cognition, they remain\nquasi-pictorial accounts, and are, in most respects, considerably less\ndeveloped than (though perhaps consistent with) the version of\nquasi-pictorial theory developed by Kosslyn. As such, they share most\nof the virtues of Kosslyn's version, and are subject to the same\nobjections (see supplement: The\nQuasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery, and its Problems). \n\nDynamical systems theory has also had relatively little to say about imagery,\nalthough Freeman (1983) has sketched an account of olfactory imagery\nin terms of neural dynamics. He explicitly distances himself from both sides\nof the analog-propositional debate, and makes appeal instead to the concept\nof search\nimage as\nused in the science of Behavioral Ecology. A search image is (to a\nfirst approximation) a specific, learned recognitional capacity, or a form\nof selective attention, that leads a predator species to recognize\nand preferentially prey upon members of the more abundant prey species in its\nenvironment, whilst largely failing to notice less abundant types of potential\nprey (Tinbergen, 1960; Atema et\nal., 1980;\nLawrence & Allen, 1983; Langley, 1996; Blough, 2002). However, it is less\nthan clear that Freeman is justified in conflating this concept of search\nimage with that of\nmental image, as used in folk psychology and cognitive science. \n\nIt is mainly the rise of situated and embodied approaches to cognition\nthat has challenged the information processing approach to perception,\nand enabled the re-emergence and further development of enactive\nimagery theory. During the 1980s, robotics researchers interested in\ncreating robots to operate in real wold environments were finding that\ngetting a machine to process information from sensory transducers into\nan internal representation of its surroundings that would provide a\nsuitable basis for action planning was a very difficult computational\nproblem. Indeed, some became convinced that, even if it could be done\nin principle, in practice the process would be unacceptably slow,\nunreliable, and computationally expensive (by the time the robot knew\nwhat was going on, things would have changed). Thus, there was a turn\ntoward “active” (or “animate”) techniques in\nrobotic perception. Instead of attempting to build up detailed\ninternal representations of their environment, robots began to be\ndesigned to deploy their sensors purposively, to actively seek out\njust the specific information needed at that particular moment for\nmaking an impending behavioral decision (e.g., Bajcsy, 1988; Ballard,\n1991; Blake & Yuille, 1992; Aloimonos, 1993; Swain & Stricker,\n1993; Nolfi & Marocco, 2002; Lungarella & Sporns, 2006; Suzuki\n& Floreano, 2008; Rasolzadeh et al., 2010; Seekircher\net al., 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Aydemir et\nal., 2013).  \n\nAt around the same time, a number of neuroscientists, perceptual\npsychologists, and philosophers began, for diverse reasons, to\nconverge on a similar view of human vision (Ramachandran, 1990;\nO'Regan, 1992; Churchland et al., 1994; Akins, 1996;\nCotterill, 1997; Thomas, 1999b, 2009; Hayhoe, 2000; O'Regan &\nNoë, 2001; Noë, 2002, 2004, 2009). Studies of (amongst other\nthings) exploratory perceptual behaviors such as eye movements\n(Yarbus, 1967; Noton & Stark, 1971a,b; Landy et al.,\n1996; Hayhoe & Ballard, 2005), and recently recognized perceptual\neffects such as change blindness (Grimes, 1996; Simons &\nLevin, 1997; O'Regan, 2003) and inattentional blindness\n(Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Mack & Rock, 1998, 1999; Simons\n& Chabris, 1999; Eitam et al., 2013; Hyman et\nal., 2014), cast doubt on the traditional idea that a rich and\ndetailed inner representation of the visual scene mediates our visual\nconsciousness.  Instead, some now argue that perception depends on a\nmultitude of special purpose neural and behavioral structures and/or\nroutines (Ullman, 1984; Ramachandran, 1990; Thomas, 1999b, 2009;\nRoelfsema et al., 2000; Hayhoe, 2000; Roelfsema, 2005), each\nof which actively utilizes the sensory transducers (eyes, ears, etc.)\nin a different way in order to obtain specific types of information as\nand when needed. We do not have our sense of the immediate perceptual\npresence of the world because we have a representation of it in our\nheads, but rather because these routines operate (for the most part)\nso quickly and effortlessly that virtually as soon as we want to know\nsome perceptually available fact, we are able to discover it.[45] \n\nAlthough this way of thinking about perception remains a minority\nview, and certainly does not dominate perceptual theory in the way\nthat information processing theory once did, it has nevertheless\ncreated a theoretical space in which an enactive/motor theory of\nimagery can be more plausibly entertained, and various versions of\nsuch theory have indeed been broached again, by thinkers from a\ndiverse range of disciplines (Thomas, 1987, 1997b, 1999b, 2009, 2014;\nNewton, 1993, 1996; Ellis, 1995; Ramachandran & Hirstein, 1997 p.\n442; Marks, 1990, 1999; Bartolomeo, 2002; Bartolomeo & Chokron,\n2002; Blain, 2006; Sima, 2011, 2013, 2014; Sima & Freksa, 2012; De\nPreester, 2012; Agnati et al., 2013; Troscianko, 2010, 2013,\n2014a,b; Bartolomeo et al., 2013).  Thomas (1999b) argues\nthat enactive theory can explain experimental cognitive psychology's\nfindings about imagery (see sections 4.2 and 4.3 above) at least as\nwell as the better-known quasi-pictorial and\npropositional/description theories, and, indeed, that it\nhandles the facts about imagery in the blind and image reconstrual\n(see\n Supplement: The Quasi-Pictorial Theory of Imagery)\n in a more principled and plausible way than\nthey do. It has also been argued that enactive theory can provide a\nmore satisfactory explanation of the neurological evidence about\nimagery (i.e., the ways imagery experience and abilities may be\nimpacted by various forms of brain damage), and, in particular, the\nsyndrome of representational neglect (see\n Supplement: Representational Neglect)\n than other theories can (Bartolomeo, 2002; Bartolomeo\n& Chokron, 2002; Dulin et al., 2008).  \n\nOther relevant evidence comes from studies of eye movements during\nimagery. Saccades are quick, mostly unconscious, flicks of the eyes,\nwhich are now known to play an important role not only in vision, but\nin visual imagery as well. In normal human vision they occur, on\naverage, three or more times every second (Richardson & Spivey,\n2004; Holmqvist et al., 2011), and play a vital role in our\nvisual system's exploration of the visual world, and the extraction of\ninformation from it. The pattern of our saccadic movements is\npurposeful, under cognitive control, and depends both on what we are\nlooking at, and on what visual information we hope to obtain, on the\npurpose behind our looking (Yarbus, 1967; Noton & Stark, 1971a,b;\nStark & Ellis, 1981; Findlay & Gilchrist, 2003; Hayhoe &\nBallard, 2005; Rucci et al., 2007; Rothkopf et al.,\n2007; Martinez-Conde & Macknik, 2007; Trommershäuser et\nal., 2009). Although the scientific study of saccades began well\nover a century ago, in recent years technological advances in\neye-tracking technology have led to a rapid growth in understanding\nand appreciation of the large role that they play in human vision\n(Richardson & Spivey, 2004; Wade & Tatler, 2005; Holmqvist\net al., 2011; Thomas, 2014 §5). It has also become\napparent that saccades (and perhaps other types of eye movement too)\nplay a significant role in visual mental imagery. Numerous recent\nexperimental studies have shown that, when people hold a visual image\nin mind, they spontaneously and unconsciously make saccadic eye\nmovements that (at least partially) enact the stimulus-specific\npattern of such movements that they would make if actually looking at\nthe equivalent visual stimulus (Brandt & Stark, 1997; Demarais\n& Cohen, 1998; Spivey et al., 2000; Spivey & Geng,\n2001; Gbadamosi & Zangemeister, 2001; Laeng & Teodorescu,\n2002; de’Sperati, 2003; Johansson et al., 2005, 2006,\n2010, 2012; Humphrey & Underwood, 2008;\nHolšánová, 2010; Holšánová\net al., 2010; Sima et al., 2010; Bourlon et\nal., 2011; Fourtassi et al., 2011, 2013; Johansson,\n2013; Johansson & Johansson, 2014; Laeng et al., 2014;\nsee also Clark, 1916; Jacobson, 1932; Totten, 1935; Altmann, 2004;\nMartarelli & Mast, 2011).\n \n\nFurthermore, imagery is disrupted (to a greater or lesser degree) if\nsomeone who is holding an image in their mind either restrains\nthemselves (to the limited degree that this is possible) from making\neye movements, or else deliberately moves their eyes in an\nimage-irrelevant way, thus disrupting the spontaneous saccadic pattern\n(Antrobus et al., 1964; Singer & Antrobus, 1965; Sharpley\net al., 1996; Andrade et al., 1997; Ruggieri, 1999;\nvan den Hout et al., 2001, 2011; Kavanagh et al.,\n2001; Laeng & Teodorescu, 2002; Barrowcliff et al., 2004;\nPostle et al., 2006; Kemps & Tiggemann, 2007; Maxfield\net al., 2008; Lee & Drummond, 2008; Gunter & Bodner,\n2008; Lilley et al., 2009; Jonikaitis et al., 2009;\nEngelhard et al., 2010, 2011; Laeng et al.,\n2014). This issue has been much researched lately, not so much because\nof its significance for our understanding of imagery, but because of\nits possible relevance to the understanding of the psychotherapeutic\ntechnique known as EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and\nReprocessing), which is widely used in the treatment of Post-Traumatic\nStress Disorder (PTSD), and which may perhaps owe its effectiveness\nlargely to the fact that deliberate eye movements tend to disrupt any\nconcurrent imagery. In EMDR treatment, patients are induced to\ndeliberately move their eyes back and forth whilst visually recalling\nthe events that have traumatized them; it is claimed that this leads\nto a significant reduction in the vividness of their memories of those\nevents, and of the distress, and consequent symptoms, that those\nmemories cause (Shapiro, 1989a, 1989b, 2001; Shapiro & Forrest,\n1997; Mollon, 2005). Studies of therapeutic outcomes seem to bear out\nclaims for EMDR’s effectiveness (Carlson et al., 1998;\nVan Etten & Taylor, 1998; Shepherd et al., 2000; Power\net al., 2002; Ironson et al., 2002; Bradley et\nal., 2005; APA, 2006; Bisson et al., 2007; Högberg\net al., 2007, 2008; van der Kolk et al., 2007;\nRodenburg et al., 2009; Kemp et al., 2010).\n \n\nAlthough the mechanisms and real therapeutic effectiveness of EMDR\nremain controversial (for negative opinions, see: Lohr et\nal., 1998, 1999; McNally, 1999; Herbert et al., 2000;\nDavidson & Parker, 2001; Taylor et al., 2003; Justman,\n2011; – for defenses and more positive assessments see: Perkins\n& Rouanzoin, 2002; Schubert & Lee, 2009; Gunter & Bodner,\n2009; Cukor et al., 2010), the disruptive effect of\ndeliberate eye movement upon visual imagery appears to be well\nestablished, and it implies that the eye movements that spontaneously\noccur when people visualize things (or, at the least, the brain\nprocesses that initiate and control these movements) are not mere\naccompaniments or epiphenomena of the imagery, but are (as enactive\ntheory would lead one to expect) a true, functionally significant part\nof the physiological process that embodies\n it.[46] (However, Mast &\nKosslyn (2002b) argue that the eye-movement evidence can also be\naccommodated to quasi-pictorial \ntheory.[47])\n \n\nKosslyn, Thompson, Sukel, & Alpert (2005; see also Kosslyn,\nThompson, & Ganis, 2006 pp. 90–92) report an experiment in\nwhich subjects were asked to recall mental images of simple\ngeometrical arrangements while PET scans of their brains were\ntaken. Although all subjects formed images of the same figures, some\noriginally formed them on the basis of verbal descriptions, whereas\nothers were shown separate segments of the entire structure to be\nvisualized, and asked to assemble them mentally into the complete\nfigure. The PET scan was not taken at the time the images were\noriginally formed in one or other of these ways, but when they were\nlater recalled. According to the experimenters, enactive theory holds\nthat when someone recalls a mental image they re-enact what they did\nat the time of its original formation, and since the two subject\ngroups originally formed their images in very different ways, the\ntheory predicts that the two groups should display radically different\npatterns of brain activation at the time of recall.  In fact, however,\nno marked differences were seen.\n \n\nThis is claimed to constitute a refutation of the enactive theory. It\nrests, however, on a demonstrable misunderstanding of the theory. No\nversion of enactive imagery theory holds (either explicitly or\nimplicitly) what these experimenters claim it holds: that recall of\nmental imagery is constituted by re-enactment of whatever was the\noriginal act of image formation. What enactive theory in fact holds is\nthat imagery (recalled or otherwise) is constituted by (partial)\nenactment of the perceptual acts that would be carried out\nif one were actually perceiving whatever is being imagined\n(Johansson et al., 2010, 2012; Laeng et al.,\n2014). It is true that in the most straightforward and paradigmatic\ncase of mental image formation – the direct recall of an earlier\nperceptual experience of something – enactment of what one\nwould be doing if actually perceiving that thing is\nequivalent to re-enactment of what one did during the\noriginal perceptual episode. However, this equivalence clearly breaks\ndown in most other circumstances, including those of the experiment in\nquestion.  Since both groups of subjects in the experiment under\ndiscussion were supposed to be recalling an image of the same\ngeometrical pattern when their brains were scanned, enactive theory\nactually predicts that the neural activity due to the recalled image\nshould be much the same in each group, just as was found.\n \n\nQuite apart from empirical evidence, certain distinctively\nphilosophical advantages have been claimed for enactive theory. It has\nbeen suggested that it is better able than its rivals to explain\nimaginal consciousness (Ellis, 1995; Thomas, 1999b, 2001, 2009;\nBartolomeo, 2002), and Thomas (1987, 1997a, 1999b, 2014) argues that\nenactive theory can provide the basis for an understanding of the\nconcept of imagination, whereas quasi-pictorial theory and\ndescription theory cannot (see also: Blain, 2006; Agnati et\nal., 2013; Thomas,\n 2014).[48] \nTroscianko (2010, 2013, 2014a,b) appears to\nagree, and, rejecting picture theory, uses the enactive theory of\nimagery as a framework for her investigation into how literary texts\ncan imaginatively affect their readers. Traditionally, both\nphilosophers and the folk have thought of the imagination as a mental\nfaculty responsible both for mental imagery, and for the most admired\nforms of artistic (and other)\n creativity.[49] \nUnfortunately, neither picture nor\ndescription theories of imagery seem capable of providing a\nsatisfactory account of how one mental faculty could be responsible\nfor both these things (which may go some way toward explaining why\nmany recent philosophers doubt whether there is any such\nfaculty[50]).\nHowever, Thomas (1997a; 1999b, 2014) argues that enactive theory\ndepicts both imagery and creative thinking as manifestations of the\nmore basic imaginative capacity of intentionalistic perception (or\n“seeing as”). Implicit in the argument is the notion that\ncertain types of creative insights should be associated with changes\nin the ways that relevant perceptions are enacted; experimental\nfindings by Thomas & Lleras (2007, 2009; Thomas, 2011) (no\nrelation) lend this idea some support. \n\nIt has also been suggested (Newton, 1993, 1996; Thomas, 1999b, 2003, 2009; \nsee also Heil, 1998 ch. 6) that, because it regards imagery not as a \nform of representational inscription (whether pictorial or \ndescriptive), but as a form of action, enactive theory may \nbe able to account for the intentionality of imagery without making \nappeal either to the controversial \n language of thought hypothesis,\n or to the widely discredited (see \n section 3.3)\n resemblance theory of \n representation.[51] \n\nHowever, if mental images are (as just about everybody believes) a \nspecies of mental representation, these latter claims are at odds \nwith the idea that mental representations are token identical to \nbrain states. The majority of cognitive scientists (and sympathetic \nphilosophers) remain firmly committed to that idea, and perhaps it is\nlargely for that reason that enactive theory remains a minority \nviewpoint. Certainly it has yet to receive anything like the amount \nof attention (either supportive or critical) that experimenters and \ntheorists have devoted to quasi-pictorial and description theories. \nFurther discussion: \n\nThe analog-propositional debate and the enactive theory of imagery concern \nthemselves primarily \nwith the nature and underlying mechanisms of the phenomenon, and have thus had\nrelatively little direct impact on views about the\nfunction of imagery in cognition. In fact, both of the best known\ncognitive theories of imagery, the quasi-pictorial theory of Kosslyn\n(1980, 1994, 2005; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006) (especially\nas philosophically glossed by Tye (1991)), and the description theory\nof Pylyshyn (1973, 1978, 2003b), portray imagery as embedded within\nand dependent upon a more fundamental, language-like mental\nrepresentational system, mentalese, from which it derives much or all\nof its semantic content. Thus neither of these theories did much to\nchallenge the post-Wittgensteinian consensus (see\n section 3.3)\n that continues to give imagery, at most, a minor, auxiliary role in \ncognition, with most of the burden being carried by either natural \nlanguage or the more basic and more flexible representations of \nthe hypothetical mentalese.  \n\nSome neuroscientists and psychologists have been little moved by this\nconsensus. Damasio (1994), for example, takes it for granted that \nmental representations are imagistic; Bisiach & Berti (1990) and \nEdelman (1992) argue that mentalese (but not image) representations \nare neuroscientifically implausible; and Paivio (e.g., 1971, 1986, 2007; \nPaivio & Begg, 1981; Sadoski & Paivio, 2001) elaborates a \ncomprehensive theory of cognition entirely in terms of image and \nnatural language representations, and holds that that the \nrepresentational power of language derives from that of imagery (see \n Supplement: Dual Coding and Common Coding Theories of Memory).\n However, as these authors did rather little to address the arguments \nthat have led most contemporary philosophers to think that imagery \ncannot be representationally basic, their views (in this \nregard) have had relatively little impact on philosophy.  \n\nHowever, more recently those arguments have been challenged \nby philosophers such as Lowe (1995, 1996, 2005), Nyíri (2001),\nand Ellis (1995). Ellis outlines a theory of how the meaningfulness \nof language may be grounded in imagery that appears to meet at least \nsome of the stock objections (see \n section 3.3,\n and Thomas, 1997b). The arguments are also addressed, at least in \npart, by Barsalou and his collaborators, who have proposed a theory \nof what they call “perceptual symbol systems” as an \nalternative to the language-like, “amodal” \n(mentalese) symbol systems of traditional cognitive science \n(Barsalou, 1993, 1999; Barsalou & Prinz, 1997; Barsalou et \nal., 2003; Kan et al., 2003). Although Barsalou denies \nthat the perceptual symbols of his theory can be \nstraightforwardly equated with mental images (mainly because he holds\nthat they may sometimes be active in cognitive processes without our \nbeing conscious of \n them)[52]\n he clearly conceives of them in a way very close to traditional \nconceptions of imagery, and certainly as being the immediate causes \nof our imagery experience when we actually do have it.  \n\nBarsalou holds that the neural basis of his perceptual symbols is a\nneural “simulation” of the brain processes that would be\ninvolved in the actual perception of whatever it is that is being\nsymbolized. Others, such as Currie (1995; Currie & Ravenscroft,\n1997; Abell & Currie, 1999) and Hesslow (2002), have also\nsuggested that imagery is best understood as a simulation of\nperception. However, quasi-pictorial, enactive, and\nprobably even propositional/descriptional theories of imagery\ncan all reasonably be classed as simulative theories in the relevant\nsense (see Nichols et al., 1996), so it is not clear that\nthis suggestion advances our understanding of the nature of imagery\nvery\n much.[53] \n In any case, Barsalou's main interest is not in the nature of \nimagery, but in how perceptual symbols might function in cognition to\ndo the jobs that others have thought can only be done by a more \nlanguage-like system of representations, such as representing logical\nrelations and propositions (as opposed to just representing \nthings). His detailed suggestions about these questions have\naroused much interest. \n\nPerhaps inspired by Barsalou's work, Prinz (2002; see also Gallese\n& Lakoff, 2005) has recently made a detailed defense of something\nvery like the traditional Empiricist theory of concepts (usually,\nalthough not invariably, interpreted as the view that concepts are\nimages (see section\n 2.3.3)).\n Like Barsalou (and, indeed, Locke), he does not take any strong \nposition as to the inherent nature of images or perceptual \nsymbols (and thus avoids embroiling himself in the \nanalog-propositional debate and its aftermath). Instead, he confines himself to trying \nto show that it is plausible that our fundamental concepts are \nperceptual in their genesis and character, a view that he is quite \nhappy to acknowledge is very close to the traditional imagery theory \nof cognition. Prinz deals ingeniously with many of the standard \nphilosophical objections to theories of this sort, and he sidesteps \nwhat has been the main philosophical objection to image theories of \nconcepts by avoiding committing himself to the resemblance theory of \nrepresentation (see \n section 3.3\n above). Instead, he suggests that his account of perceptual \nrepresentations can be combined with a version of the causal (or \ncovariation) theory of intentional content developed by Fodor (1990, \n1994), Dretske (1995, 2000), and \n others.[54]\n However, it remains open to question whether such a causal theory can\nwork (Cummins, 1997; Horst, 1996, 1999).  \n\nGauker (2011), by contrast, aligns himself more closely with the\nmainstream of twentieth century philosophy (see\n section 3.3) in arguing that concepts (or\nideas) cannot be identified with, or directly derived from,\nimages, and are dependent upon a shared language, rather than being\nprior to it. Nevertheless, he holds that mental imagery plays a\ncrucial role in human cognition and its development, because it forms\nthe basis of a non-conceptual type of thought (unfortunately, as he\nadmits (Gauker, 2011 p. 145f.), one that is scarcely acknowledged by\ncontemporary psychological science) that not only plays a continuing\nrole in human thinking, but also makes the learning of a first\nlanguage by infants, and the continuing use of language, and thus the\ndevelopment and use of true concepts, possible. This enables him to\navoid extravagant hypotheses, such as the positing of an innate,\nconceptual, and semantically rich, but introspectively inaccessible,\nlanguage of thought, that other philosophers, such as Fodor\n(1975) have held to be necessary components of any adequate theory of\nlanguage and learning and understanding (although, of course, some\nmight consider Gauker’s conception of non-conceptual but\ninstrumentally powerful imagistic thought to be an extravagant or\nill-founded hypothesis in its own right). \n\nOther recent work has sought to explore the relationship, or lack\nthereof, between current conceptions of mental imagery and the more\nresonant, but more nebulous, notion of imagination (and\nrelated, or putatively related phenomena or concepts such as\ndreams, hallucinations, insight, and creativity)\n(White, 1990; Brann, 1991; Finke et al., 1992; Thomas,\n1997a,b, 1999a,b, 2006, 2014; Kind, 2001; McGinn, 2004; Blain,\n2006). Perhaps the most ambitious claims in this regard are those of\nArp (2005, 2008), who comes at the matter from the controversial\nperspective of evolutionary psychology. Arp suggests that an\ninnate, evolved capacity for what he calls scenario\nvisualization (which is perhaps a similar notion the\n“imagistic thinking” championed by Gauker) is unique to\nthe human species, and is the crucial factor that has made our\nhigh-level creative problem-solving abilities possible. From this\nperspective, it is in large part thanks to our capacity to form and\nmanipulate mental imagery that humankind has been able to out-compete\nrival species, and develop our complex cultures and technologies."}]
