The name Confucius, a Latinized combination of\nthe surname Kong 孔 with an honorific suffix “Master”\n(fuzi 夫子), has also come to be used as a global metonym for\ndifferent aspects of traditional East Asian society. This association\nof Confucius with many of the foundational concepts and cultural\npractices in East Asia, and his casting as a progenitor of\n“Eastern” thought in Early Modern Europe, make him\narguably the most significant thinker in East Asian history. Yet while\nearly sources preserve biographical details about Master Kong,\ndialogues and stories about him in early texts like the\nAnalects (Lunyu 論語) reflect a diversity of\nrepresentations and concerns, strands of which were later\ndifferentially selected and woven together by interpreters intent on\nappropriating or condemning particular associated views and\ntraditions. This means that the philosophy of Confucius is\nhistorically underdetermined, and it is possible to trace multiple\nsets of coherent doctrines back to the early period, each grounded in\ndifferent sets of classical sources and schools of interpretation\nlinked to his name. After introducing key texts and interpreters,\nthen, this entry explores three principal interconnected areas of\nconcern: a psychology of ritual that describes how ideal social forms\nregulate individuals, an ethics rooted in the cultivation of a set of\npersonal virtues, and a theory of society and politics based on\nnormative views of the family and the state.\n\n\nEach of these areas has unique features that were developed by later\nthinkers, some of whom have been identified as\n“Confucians”, even though that term is not well-defined.\nThe Chinese term Ru (儒) predates Confucius, and\nconnoted specialists in ritual and music, and later experts in\nClassical Studies. Ru is routinely translated\ninto English as “Confucian”. Yet “Confucian”\nis also sometimes used in English to refer to the sage kings of\nantiquity who were credited with key cultural innovations by the\nRu, to sacrificial practices at temples dedicated to\nConfucius and related figures, and to traditional features of East\nAsian social organization like the “bureaucracy” or\n“meritocracy”. For this reason, the term Confucian will be avoided\nin this entry, which will focus on the philosophical aspects of the\nthought of Confucius (the Latinization used for “Master\nKong” following the English-language convention) primarily, but\nnot exclusively, through the lens of the Analects.\n\nBecause of the wide range of texts and traditions identified with him,\nchoices about which version of Confucius is authoritative have changed\nover time, reflecting particular political and social priorities. The\nportrait of Confucius as philosopher is, in part, the product of a\nseries of modern cross-cultural interactions. In Imperial China,\nConfucius was identified with interpretations of the classics and\nmoral guidelines for administrators, and therefore also with training\nthe scholar-officials that populated the bureaucracy. At the same\ntime, he was closely associated with the transmission of the ancient\nsacrificial system, and he himself received ritual offerings in\ntemples found in all major cities. By the Han (202 BCE–220 CE),\nConfucius was already an authoritative figure in a number of different\ncultural domains, and the early commentaries show that reading texts\nassociated with him about history, ritual, and proper behavior was\nimportant to rulers. The first commentaries to the Analects\nwere written by tutors to the crown prince (e.g., Zhang Yu 張禹, d. 5 BCE),\nand select experts in the “Five Classics”\n(Wujing 五經) were given scholastic positions in the government.\nThe authority of Confucius was such that during the late Han and the\nfollowing period of disunity, his imprimatur was used to validate\ncommentaries to the classics, encoded political prophecies, and\nesoteric doctrines. \nBy the Song period (960–1279), the post-Buddhist revival known\nas “Neo-Confucianism” anchored readings of the dialogues\nof Confucius to a dualism between “cosmic pattern”\n(li 理) and “pneumas” (qi\n氣), a distinctive moral cosmology that marked the tradition off\nfrom those of Buddhism and Daoism. The Neo-Confucian interpretation of\nthe Analects by Zhu Xi 朱熹 (1130–1200)\nintegrated the study of the Analects into a curriculum based\non the “Four Books” (Sishu 四書) that\nbecame widely influential in China, Korea, and Japan. The pre-modern\nConfucius was closely associated with good government, moral\neducation, proper ritual performance, and the reciprocal obligations\nthat people in different roles owed each other in such contexts. \nWhen Confucius became a character in the intellectual debates of\neighteenth century Europe, he became identified as China’s first\nphilosopher. Jesuit missionaries in China sent back accounts of\nancient China that portrayed Confucius as inspired by Natural Theology\nto pursue the good, which they considered a marked contrast with the\n“idolatries” of Buddhism and Daoism. Back in Europe,\nintellectuals read missionary descriptions and translations of Chinese\nliterature, and writers like Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\n(1646–1716) and Nicolas-Gabriel Clerc (1726–1798) praised\nConfucius for his discovery of universal natural laws through reason.\nEnlightenment writers celebrated the moral philosophy of Confucius for\nits independence from the dogmatic influence of the Church. While at\ntimes he was criticized as an atheist or an advocate of despotism,\nmany Europeans viewed Confucius as a moral philosopher whose approach\nwas in line with rationalism and humanism. \nToday, many descriptions combine these several ways of positioning\nConfucius, but the modern interpretation of his views has been\ncomplicated by a tendency to look back on him as an emblem of the\n“traditional culture” of China. In the eyes of some late\nnineteenth and twentieth century reformers who sought to fortify China\nagainst foreign influence, the moral teachings of Confucius had the\npotential to play the same role that they perceived Christianity had\ndone in the modernization of Europe and America, or serve as the basis\nof a more secular spiritual renewal that would transform the\npopulation into citizens of a modern nation-state. In the twentieth\ncentury, the pursuit of modernization also led to the rejection of\nConfucius by some reformers in the May Fourth and New Culture\nmovements, as well as by many in the Communist Party, who identified\nthe traditional hierarchies implicit in his social and political\nphilosophy with the social and economic inequalities that they sought\nto eliminate. In these modern debates, it is not just the status of \nConfucius in traditional China that made him such a potent symbol.\nHis specific association with the curriculum of the system of education of\nscholar-officials in the imperial government, and of traditional moral\nvalues more generally, connected him to the aspects of tradition worth\npreserving, or the things that held China back from modernization,\ndepending on one’s point of view. \nAs legacies of Confucius tied to traditional ritual roles and the\npre-modern social structure were criticized by modernizers, a view of\nConfucius as a moral philosopher, already common in European readings,\ngained ascendancy in East Asia. The American-educated historian Hu Shi\n胡適 (1891–1962) wrote an early influential history\nof Chinese philosophy, beginning with Laozi 老子 and\nConfucius, explicitly on the model of existing histories of Western\nphilosophy. In it, Hu compared what he called the conservative aspect\nof the philosophy of Confucius to Socrates and Plato. Since at least\nthat time, Confucius has been central to most histories of Chinese\nphilosophy. \nBiographical treatments of Confucius, beginning with the\n“Hereditary House of Confucius” (Kongzi shijia\n孔子世家), a chapter of Sima Qian’s\n司馬遷 (c.145–c.86 BCE) Records of the\nGrand Historian (Shiji 史記), were initially\nbased on information from compilations of independently circulating\ndialogues and prose accounts. Tying particular elements of his\nphilosophy to the life experiences of Confucius is a risky and\npotentially circular exercise, since many of the details of his\nbiography were first recorded in instructive anecdotes linked to the\nexpression of didactic messages. Nevertheless, since Sima Qian’s\ntime, the biography of Confucius has been intimately linked with the\ninterpretation of his philosophy, and so this section begins with a\nbrief treatment of traditional tropes about his family background,\nofficial career, and teaching of 72 disciples, before turning to the\ndialogue and prose accounts upon which early biographers like Sima\nQian drew. \nConfucius was born in the domain of Zou, in modern Shandong Province,\nsouth of the larger kingdom of Lu. A date of 551 BCE is given for his\nbirth in the Gongyang Commentary (Gongyang zhuan\n公羊傳) to the classic Spring and Autumn\nAnnals (Chunqiu 春秋), which places him in\nthe period when the influence of the Zhou polity was declining, and\nregional domains were becoming independent states.  His father, who\ncame from Lu, was descended from a noble clan that included, in Sima\nQian’s telling, several people known for their modesty and\nritual mastery. His father died when Confucius was a small child,\nleaving the family poor but with some social status, and as a young\nman Confucius became known for expertise in the classical ritual and\nceremonial forms of the Zhou. In adulthood, Confucius travelled to Lu\nand began a career as an official in the employ of aristocratic\nfamilies. \nDifferent sources identify Confucius as having held a large number of\ndifferent offices in Lu. Entries in the Zuo Commentary\n(Zuozhuan 左傳) to the Spring and Autumn\nAnnals for 509 and 500 BCE identify him as Director of\nCorrections (Sikou 司寇), and say he was charged\nwith assisting the ruler with the rituals surrounding a visiting\ndignitary from the state of Qi, respectively.  The Mencius\n(Mengzi 孟子), a text centered on a figure\ngenerally regarded as the most important early developer of the\nthought of Confucius, Mencius (trad. 372–289 BCE), says\nConfucius was Foodstuffs Scribe (Weili 委吏) and\nScribe in the Field (Chengtian 乘田), involved\nwith managing the accounting at the granary and keeping the books on\nthe pasturing of different animals\n(11.14).[1] In the\nfirst biography, Sima Qian mentions these offices, but then adds a\nsecond set of more powerful positions in Lu including Steward\n(Zai 宰) managing an estate in the district of Zhongdu,\nMinister of Works (Sikong 司空), and even acting\nChancellor (Xiang 相). Following his departure from Lu,\ndifferent stories place Confucius in the kingdoms of Wei, Song, Chen,\nCai, and Chu. Sima Qian crafted these stories into a serial narrative\nof rulers failing to appreciate the moral worth of Confucius, whose\nhigh standards forced him to continue to travel in search of an\nincorrupt ruler. \nLate in life, Confucius left service and turned to teaching. In Sima\nQian’s time, the sheer number of independently circulating texts\ncentering on dialogues that Confucius had with his disciples led the\nbiographer to include a separate chapter on “The arranged\ntraditions of the disciples of Confucius” (Zhongni dizi\nliezhuan 仲尼弟子列傳). His\naccount identifies 77 direct disciples, whom Sima Qian says Confucius\ntrained in ritual practice and the Classic of Odes\n(Shijing 詩經), Classic of Documents\n(Shujing 書經, also called Documents of the\nPredecessors or Shangshu 尚書), Records\nof Ritual (Liji 禮記) and\nClassic of Music (Yuejing 樂經). Altogether, some 3000\nstudents received some form of this training regimen. Sima\nQian’s editorial practice in systematizing dialogues was\ninclusive, and the fact that he was able to collect so much\ninformation some three centuries after the death of Confucius\ntestifies to the latter’s importance in the Han period. Looked\nat in a different way, the prodigious numbers of direct disciples and\nstudents of Confucius, and the inconsistent accounts of the offices in\nwhich he served, may also be due to a proliferation of texts\nassociating the increasingly authoritative figure of Confucius with\ndivergent regional or interpretive traditions during those intervening\ncenturies. \nThe many sources of quotations and dialogues of Confucius, both\ntransmitted and recently excavated, provide a wealth of materials\nabout the philosophy of Confucius, but an incomplete sense of which\nmaterials are authoritative. The last millennium has seen the\ndevelopment of a conventional view that materials preserved in the\ntwenty chapters of the transmitted Analects most accurately\nrepresent Confucius’s original teachings. This derives in part\nfrom a second century CE account by Ban Gu 班固\n(39–92 CE) of the composition of the Analects that\ndescribes the work as having been compiled by first and second\ngeneration disciples of Confucius and then transmitted privately for\ncenturies, making it arguably the oldest stratum of extant Confucius\nsources. In the centuries since, some scholars have come up with\nvariations on this basic account, such as Liu Baonan’s\n劉寳楠 (1791–1855) view in Corrected Meanings\nof the Analects (Lunyu zhengyi\n論語正義) that each chapter was written by a\ndifferent disciple. Recently, several centuries of doubts about\ninternal inconsistencies in the text and a lack of references to the\ntitle in early sources were marshaled by classicist Zhu Weizheng\n朱維錚 in an influential 1986 article which argued\nthat the lack of attributed quotations from the Analects, and\nof explicit references to it, prior to the second century BCE, meant\nthat its traditional status as the oldest stratum of the teachings of\nConfucius was undeserved. Since then a number of historians, including\nMichael J. Hunter, have systematically shown that writers started to\ndemonstrate an acute interest in the Analects only in the\nlate second and first centuries BCE, suggesting that other\nConfucius-related records from those centuries should also be\nconsidered as potentially authoritative sources. Some have suggested\nthis critical approach to sources is an attack on the historicity of\nConfucius, but a more reasonable description is that it is an attack\non the authoritativeness of the Analects that broadens and\ndiversifies the sources that may be used to reconstruct the historical\nConfucius. \nExpanding the corpus of Confucius quotations and dialogues beyond the\nAnalects, then, requires attention to three additional types\nof sources. First, dialogues preserved in transmitted sources like the\nRecords of Ritual, the Elder Dai’s Records of\nRitual (DaDai Liji 大戴禮記),\nand Han collections like the\nFamily Discussions of Confucius (Kongzi jiayu\n孔子家語) contain a large number of diverse\nteachings. Second, quotations attached to the interpretation of\npassages in the classics preserved in works like the Zuo\nCommentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals,\nor Han’s Intertextual Commentary on the Odes (Han\nShi waizhuan 韓詩外傳) are particularly\nrich sources for readings of history and poetry. Finally, a number of\nrecently archaeologically recovered texts from the Han period and\nbefore have also expanded the corpus. \nNewly discovered sources include three recently excavated versions of\ntexts with parallel to the transmitted Analects. These are\nthe 1973 excavation at the Dingzhou site in Hebei Province dating to\n55 BCE; the 1990’s excavation of a partial parallel version at\nJongbaekdong in Pyongyang, North Korea, dating to between 62 and 45\nBCE; and most recently the 2011-2015 excavation of the tomb of the Marquis\nof Haihun in Jiangxi Province dating to 59 BCE. The Haihun excavation\nis particularly important because it is thought to contain the two\nlost chapters of what Han period sources identify as a 22-chapter\nversion of the Analects that circulated in the state of Qi,\nthe titles of which appear to be “Understanding the Way”\n(Zhi dao 智道) and “Questions about\nJade” (Wen yu 問玉). While the\nHaihun Analects has yet to be published, the content of the\nlost chapters overlaps with a handful of fragments dating to the late\nfirst century BCE that were found at the Jianshui Jinguan site in\nJinta county in Gansu Province in 1973. All in all, these finds\nconfirm the sudden wide circulation of the Analects in the\nmiddle of the first century BCE. \nPreviously unknown Confucius dialogues and quotations have also been\nunearthed. The Dingzhou site also yielded texts given the titles\n“Sayings of the Ru” (Rujiazhe yan\n儒家者言) and “Duke Ai asked about the\nfive kinds of righteousness” (Aigong wen wuyi\n哀公問五義). A significantly different\ntext also given the name “Sayings of the Ru” was found in\n1977 in a Han tomb at Fuyang in Anhui Province. Several texts dating\nto 168 BCE recording statements by Confucius about the\nClassic of Changes (Yijing 易經) were\nexcavated from the Mawangdui site in Hunan Province in\n1973. Additionally, a number of Warring States period dialogical texts\ncentered on particular disciples, and a text with interpretative\ncomments by Confucius on the Classic of Poetry given the name\n“Confucius discusses the Odes” (Kongzi\nshilun 孔子詩論), were looted from tombs in the 1990s, sold on the black market, \nand made their way to the Shanghai Museum. Finally, the 59 BCE tomb of the\nMarquis of Haihun also contains a number of previously unknown\nConfucius dialogues and quotations on ritual and filial piety, along\nwith materials that overlap with sections of transmitted texts\nincluding the Analects, Records of Ritual and the\nElder Dai’s Records of Ritual. \nSome excavated texts, like the pre-Han period “Thicket of\nSayings” (Yucong 語叢) apothegms excavated\nat the Guodian site in Hubei Province in 1993, contain fragments of\nthe\nAnalects in circulation without attribution to Confucius.\nTransmitted materials also show some of the quotations attributed to\nConfucius in the Analects in the mouths of other historical\nfigures. The fluidity and diversity of Confucius-related materials in\ncirculation prior to the fixing of the Analects text in the\nsecond century BCE, suggest that the Analects itself, with\nits keen interest in ritual, personal ethics, and politics, may well\nhave been in part a topical selection from a larger and more diverse\nset of available Confucius-related materials. In other words, there\nwere already multiple topical foci prior to any horizon by which we\ncan definitively deem any single focus to be authoritative. It is for\nthis reason that the essential core of the teachings of Confucius is\nhistorically underdetermined, and the correct identification of the\ncore teachings is still avidly debated. The following sections treat\nthree key aspects of the philosophy of Confucius, each different but\nall interrelated, found throughout many of these diverse sets of\nsources: a theory of how ritual and musical performance functioned to\npromote unselfishness and train emotions, advice on how to inculcate a\nset of personal virtues to prepare people to behave morally in\ndifferent domains of their lives, and a social and political\nphilosophy that abstracted classical ideals of proper conduct in\nfamily and official contexts to apply to more general contexts. \nThe Records of Ritual, the Analects, and numerous\nHan collections portray Confucius as being deeply\nconcerned with the proper performance of ritual and music. In such works, the description of the attitudes and affect of the performer became the foundation of a\nritual psychology in which proper performance was key to reforming\ndesires and beginning to develop moral dispositions. Confucius sought\nto preserve the Zhou ritual system, and theorized about how ritual and\nmusic inculcated social roles, limited desires and transformed\ncharacter. \nMany biographies begin their description of his life with a story of\nConfucius at an early age performing rituals, reflecting accounts and\nstatements that demonstrate his prodigious mastery of ritual and\nmusic. The archaeological record shows that one legacy of the Zhou\nperiod into which Confucius was born was a system of sumptuary\nregulations that encoded social status. Another of these legacies was\nancestral sacrifice, a means to demonstrate people’s reverence\nfor their ancestors while also providing a way to ask the spirits to\nassist them or to guarantee them protection from harm. The\nAnalects describes the ritual mastery of Confucius in\nreceiving guests at a noble’s home (10.3), and in carrying out\nsacrifices (10.8, 15.1). He plays the stone chimes (14.39),\ndistinguishes between proper and improper music (15.11, 17.18), and\nextols and explains the Classic of Odes to his disciples\n(1.15, 2.2, 8.3, 16.13, 17.9). This mastery of classical ritual and\nmusical forms is an important reason Confucius said he “followed\nZhou” (3.14). While he might alter a detail of a ritual out of\nfrugality (9.3), Confucius insists on adherence to the letter of the rites,\nas when his disciple Zi Gong 子貢 sought to substitute another animal for a\nsheep in a seasonal sacrifice, saying “though you care about the\nsheep, I care about the ritual” (3.17). It was in large part\nthis adherence to Zhou period cultural forms, or to what Confucius\nreconstructed them to be, that has led many in the modern period to\nlabel him a traditionalist. \nWhere Confucius clearly innovated was in his rationale for performing\nthe rites and music. Historian Yan Buke 閻步克 has\nargued that the early Confucian (Ru) tradition began from the\noffice of the “Music master” (Yueshi\n樂師) described in the\nRitual of Zhou (Zhou Li 周禮). Yan’s view is that\nsince these officials were responsible for teaching the rites, music,\nand the Classic of Odes, it was their combined expertise that\ndeveloped into the particular vocation that shaped the outlook of\nConfucius. Early discussions of ritual in the Zhou classics often\nexplained ritual in terms of a do ut des view of making\nofferings to receive benefits. By contrast, early discussions between\nConfucius and his disciples described benefits of ritual performance\nthat went beyond the propitiation of spirits, rewards from the\nancestors, or the maintenance of the social or cosmic order. Instead\nof emphasizing goods that were external to the performer, these works\nstressed the value of the associated interior psychological states of\nthe practitioner. In Analects 3.26, Confucius condemns the\nperformance of ritual without reverence (jing 敬). He also\ncondemns views of ritual that focus only on the offerings, or views of\nmusic that focus only on the instruments (17.11). Passages from the Records of\nRitual explain that Confucius would rather have an excess of\nreverence than an excess of ritual (“Tangong,\nshang” 檀弓上), and that reverence is the most important aspect of\nmourning rites (“Zaji, xia” 雜記下). This emphasis on the\nimportance of an attitude of reverence became the salient distinction\nbetween performing ritual in a rote manner, and performing it in the\nproper affective state. Another passage from the Records of Ritual\nsays the difference between how an ideal gentleman and a\nlesser person cares for a parent is that the gentleman is reverent\nwhen he does it (“Fangji” 坊記, cf. Analects\n2.7). In contexts concerning both ritual and filial piety (xiao 孝),\nthe affective state behind the action is arguably more important than\nthe action’s consequences. As Philip J. Ivanhoe has\nwritten, ritual and music are not just an indicator of values in the\nsense that these examples show, but also an inculcator of them. \nIn this ritual psychology, the performance of ritual and music restricts\ndesires because it alters the performer’s affective states, and\nplace limits on appetitive desires. The Records of Ritual\nillustrates desirable affective states, describing how the Zhou\nfounder King Wen 文 was moved to joy when making offerings to\nhis deceased parents, but then to grief once the ritual ended\n(“Jiyi” 祭義). A collection\nassociated with the third century BCE philosopher Xunzi 荀子 contains a\nConfucius quotation that associates different parts of a ruler’s\nday with particular emotions. Entering the ancestral temple to make\nofferings and maintain a connection to those who are no longer living\nleads the ruler to reflect on sorrow, while wearing a cap to hear\nlegal cases leads him to reflect on worry (“Aigong” 哀公). These are examples of the way that\nritual fosters the development of particular emotional responses, part\nof a sophisticated understanding of affective states and the ways that\nperformance channels them in particular directions. More generally,\nthe social conventions implicit in ritual hierarchies restrict\npeople’s latitude to pursue their desires, as the master\nexplains in the Records of Ritual:  \nThe way of the gentleman may be compared to an embankment dam,\nbolstering those areas where ordinary people are deficient\n(“Fangji”).  \nBlocking the overflow of desires by adhering to these social norms\npreserves psychological space to reflect and reform one’s\nreactions. \nDescriptions of the early community depict Confucius creating a\nsubculture in which ritual provided an alternate source of value,\neffectively training his disciples to opt out of conventional modes of\nexchange. In the Analects, when Confucius says he would\ninstruct any person who presented him with “a bundle of dried\nmeat” (7.7), he is highlighting how his standards of value\nderive from the sacrificial system, eschewing currency or luxury\nitems. Gifts valuable in ordinary situations might be worth little by\nsuch standards: “Even if a friend gave him a gift of a carriage\nand horses, if it was not dried meat, he did not bow” (10.15).\nThe Han period biographical materials in Records of the\nHistorian describe how a high official of the state of Lu did not\ncome to court for three days after the state of Qi made him a gift of\nfemale entertainers. When, additionally, the high official failed to\nproperly offer gifts of sacrificial meats, Confucius\ndeparted Lu for the state of Wei (47, cf. Analects 18.4).\nConfucius repeatedly rejected conventional values of wealth and\nposition, choosing instead to rely on ritual standards of value. In\nsome ways, these stories are similar to ones in the late Warring\nStates and Han period compilation Master Zhuang (Zhuangzi\n莊子) that explore the way that things that are\nconventionally belittled for their lack of utility are useful by an\nunconventional standard.  However, here the standard that gives such objects currency is ritual importance rather than longevity, divorcing\nConfucius from conventional materialistic or hedonistic pursuits. This\nis a second way that ritual allows one to direct more effort into\ncharacter formation. \nOnce, when speaking of cultivating benevolence, Confucius explained\nhow ritual value was connected to the ideal way of the gentleman,\nwhich should always take precedence over the pursuit of conventional\nvalues:  \nWealth and high social status are what others covet. If I cannot\nprosper by following the way, I will not dwell in them. Poverty and\nlow social status are what others shun. If I cannot prosper by\nfollowing the way, I will not avoid them. (4.5)  \nThe argument that ritual performance has internal benefits underlies\nthe ritual psychology laid out by Confucius, one that explains how\nperforming ritual and music controls desires and sets the stage for\nfurther moral development. \nMany of the short passages from the Analects, and the\n“Thicket of Sayings” passages excavated at Guodian,\ndescribe the development of set of ideal behaviors associated with the\nmoral ideal of the “way” (dao 道) of the\n“gentleman” (junzi 君子). Based on\nthe analogy between the way of Confucius and character ethics systems\nderiving from Aristotle, these patterns of behavior are today often\ndescribed using the Latinate term “virtue”. In the second\npassage in the\nAnalects, the disciple You Ruo 有若 says a person who behaves with\nfilial piety to parents and siblings (xiao and di 弟),\nand who avoids going against superiors, will rarely disorder society.\nIt relates this correlation to a more general picture of how patterns\nof good behavior effectively open up the possibility of following the\nway of the gentleman: “The gentleman works at the roots. Once\nthe roots are established, the way comes to life” (1.2). The way\nof the gentleman is a distillation of the exemplary behaviors of the\nselfless culture heroes of the past, and is available to all who are\nwilling to “work at the roots”. In this way, the virtues\nthat Confucius taught were not original to him, but represented his\nadaptations of existing cultural ideals, to which he continually\nreturned in order to clarify their proper expressions in different\nsituations. Five behaviors of the gentleman most central to the\nAnalects are benevolence (ren 仁), righteousness\n(yi 義), ritual propriety (li 禮), wisdom (zhi 智),\nand trustworthiness (xin 信). \nThe virtue of benevolence entails interacting with others guided by a\nsense of what is good from their perspectives. Sometimes the\nAnalects defines benevolence generally as “caring for\nothers” (12.22), but in certain contexts it is associated with\nmore specific behaviors. Examples of contextual definitions of\nbenevolence include treating people on the street as important guests\nand common people as if they were attendants at a sacrifice (12.2),\nbeing reticent in speaking (12.3) and rejecting the use of clever\nspeech (1.3), and being respectful where one dwells, reverent where\none works, and loyal where one deals with others (13.19). It is the\nbroadest of the virtues, yet a gentleman would rather die than\ncompromise it (15.9). Benevolence entails a kind of unselfishness, or,\nas David Hall and Roger Ames suggest, it involves forming moral\njudgments from a combined perspective of self and others. \nLater writers developed accounts of the sources of benevolent\nbehavior, most famously in the context of the discussion of human\nnature (xing 性) in the centuries after\nConfucius. Mencius (fourth century BCE) argued that benevolence grows\nout of the cultivation of an affective disposition to compassion\n(ceyin 惻隱) in the face of another’s\ndistress. The anonymous author of the late Warring States period\nexcavated text “Five Kinds of Action” (Wu xing\n五行) describes it as building from the affection one\nfeels for close family members, through successive stages to finally\ndevelop into a more universal, fully-fledged virtue.  In\nthe Analects, however, one comment on human nature\nemphasizes the importance of nurture: “By nature people are\nclose, by habituation they are miles apart” (17.2), a sentiment\nthat suggests the importance of training one’s dispositions\nthrough ritual and the classics in a manner closer to the program of Xunzi (third century\nBCE). The Analects, however, discusses the incubation of\nbenevolent behavior in family and ritual contexts. You Ruo winds up\nhis discussion of the roots of the way of the gentleman with the\nrhetorical question: “Is not behaving with filial piety to\none’s parents and siblings the root of benevolence?”\n(1.2). Confucius tells his disciple Yan Yuan 顏淵 that\nbenevolence is a matter of “overcoming oneself and returning to\nritual propriety” (12.1). These connections between benevolence\nand other virtues underscore the way in which benevolent behavior does\nnot entail creating novel social forms or relationships, but is\ngrounded in traditional familial and ritual networks. \nThe second virtue, righteousness, is often described in the Analects relative to\nsituations involving public responsibility. In contexts where\nstandards of fairness and integrity are valuable, such as acting as\nthe steward of an estate as some of the disciples of Confucius did,\nrighteousness is what keeps a person uncorrupted. Confucius wrote that\na gentleman “thinks of righteousness when faced with gain”\n(16.10, 19.10), or “when faced with profit” (14.12).\nConfucius says that one should ignore the wealth and rank one might\nattain by acting against righteousness, even if it means eating coarse\nrice, drinking water, and sleeping using one’s bent arm as a\npillow (7.16). Later writers like Xunzi celebrated Confucius for his\nrighteousness in office, which he stressed was all the more impressive\nbecause Confucius was extremely poor (“Wangba”\n王霸). This behavior is particularly relevant in official\ninteractions with ordinary people, such as when “employing\ncommon people” (5.16), and if a social superior has mastered it,\n“the common people will all comply” (13.4). Like\nbenevolence, righteousness also entails unselfishness, but instead of\ncoming out of consideration for the needs of others, it is rooted in\nsteadfastness in the face of temptation. \nThe perspective needed to act in a righteous way is sometimes related\nto an attitude to personal profit that recalls the previous\nsection’s discussion of how Confucius taught his disciples to\nrecalibrate their sense of value based on their immersion in the\nsacrificial system. More specifically, evaluating things based on\ntheir ritual significance can put one at odds with conventional\nhierarchies of value. This is defined as the root of righteous\nbehavior in a story from the late Warring States period text\nMaster Fei of Han (Han Feizi 韓非子). The tale relates how\nat court, Confucius was given a plate with a peach and a pile of\nmillet grains with which to scrub the fruit clean. After the\nattendants laughed at Confucius for proceeding to eat the millet\nfirst, Confucius explained to them that in sacrifices to the Former Kings,\nmillet itself is the most valued offering. Therefore, cleaning a\nritually base peach with millet:  \nwould be obstructing righteousness, and so I dared not put [the peach]\nabove what fills the vessels in the ancestral shrine.\n(“Waichu shuo, zuo shang”\n外儲說左上)  \nWhile such stories may have been told to mock his fastidiousness, for\nConfucius the essence of righteousness was internalizing a system of\nvalue that he would breach for neither convenience nor profit. \nAt times, the phrase “benevolence and righteousness” is\nused metonymically for all the virtues, but in some later texts, a\nbenevolent impulse to compassion and a righteous steadfastness are\nseen as potentially contradictory. In the Analects,\nportrayals of Confucius do not recognize a tension between benevolence\nand righteousness, perhaps because each is usually described as\nsalient in a different set of contexts. In ritual contexts like courts\nor shrines, one ideally acts like one might act out of familial\naffection in a personal context, the paradigm that is key to\nbenevolence. In the performance of official duties, one ideally acts\nout of the responsibilities felt to inferiors and superiors, with a\nresistance to temptation by corrupt gain that is key to\nrighteousness. The Records of Ritual distinguishes between the\ndomains of these two virtues:  \nIn regulating one’s household, kindness overrules righteousness.\nOutside of one’s house, righteousness cuts off kindness. What\none undertakes in serving one’s father, one also does in serving\none’s lord, because one’s reverence for both is the same.\nTreating nobility in a noble way and the honorable in an honorable\nway, is the height of righteousness. (“Sangfu\nsizhi” 喪服四制)  \nWhile it is not the case that righteousness is benevolence by other\nmeans, this passage underlines how in different contexts, different\nvirtues may push people toward participation in particular shared\ncultural practices constitutive of the good life. \nWhile the virtues of benevolence and righteousness might impel a gentleman to adhere to ritual\nnorms in particular situations or areas of life, a third virtue of\n“ritual propriety” expresses a sensitivity to one’s\nsocial place, and willingness to play all of one’s multiple\nritual roles. The term li translated here as “ritual\npropriety” has a particularly wide range of connotations, and\nadditionally connotes both the conventions of ritual and etiquette. In\nthe Analects, Confucius is depicted both teaching and\nconducting the rites in the manner that he believed they were\nconducted in antiquity. Detailed restrictions such as “the\ngentleman avoids wearing garments with red-black trim” (10.6),\nwhich the poet Ezra Pound disparaged as “verses re: length of\nthe night-gown and the predilection for ginger” (Pound 1951:\n191), were by no means trivial to Confucius. His imperative, “Do\nnot look or listen, speak or move, unless it is in accordance with the\nrites” (12.1), in answer to a question about benevolence,\nillustrates how the symbolic conventions of the ritual system played a\nrole in the cultivation of the virtues. We have seen how ritual shapes\nvalues by restricting desires, thereby allowing reflection and the\ncultivation of moral dispositions. Yet without the proper affective\nstate, a person is not properly performing ritual. In the\nAnalects, Confucius says he cannot tolerate “ritual\nwithout reverence, or mourning without grief,” (3.26). When\nasked about the root of ritual propriety, he says that in funerals,\nthe mourners’ distress is more important than the formalities\n(3.4). Knowing the details of ritual protocols is important, but is\nnot a substitute for sincere affect in performing them. Together, they\nare necessary conditions for the gentleman’s training, and are also\nessential to understanding the social context in which Confucius\ntaught his disciples. \nThe mastery that “ritual propriety” signaled was part of a\ncurriculum associated with the training of rulers and officials, and\nproper ritual performance at court could also serve as a kind of political\nlegitimation. Confucius summarized the different prongs of the\neducation in ritual and music involved in the training of his\nfollowers:  \nRaise yourself up with the Classic of Odes. Establish\nyourself with ritual. Complete yourself with music. (8.8)  \nOn one occasion, Boyu 伯魚, the son of Confucius,\nexplained that when he asked his father to teach him, his father told\nhim to study the\nClassic of Odes in order to have a means to speak with\nothers, and to study ritual to establish himself (16.13). That\nConfucius insists that his son master classical literature and practices\nunderscores the values of these cultural products as a means of\ntransmitting the way from one generation to the next. He tells his\ndisciples that the study of the Classic of Odes prepares them\nfor different aspects of life, providing them with a capacity to:  \nat home serve one’s father, away from it serve\none’s lord, as well as increase one's knowledge of the names of birds,\nanimals, plants and trees. (17.9)  \nThis valuation of knowledge of both the cultural and\nnatural worlds is one reason why the figure of Confucius has\ntraditionally been identified with schooling, and why today his\nbirthday is celebrated as “Teacher’s Day” in some\nparts of Asia. In the ancient world, this kind of education also\nqualified Confucius and his disciples for employment on estates and at\ncourts. \nThe fourth virtue, wisdom, is related to appraising people and\nsituations. In the Analects, wisdom allows a gentleman to\ndiscern crooked and straight behavior in others (12.22), and\ndiscriminate between those who may be reformed and those who may not\n(15.8). In the former dialogue, Confucius explains the virtue of\nwisdom as “knowing others”. The “Thicket of\nSayings” excavated at Guodian indicates that this knowledge is\nthe basis for properly “selecting” others, defining wisdom\nas the virtue that is the basis for selection. But it is also about\nappraising situations correctly, as suggested by the master’s\nrhetorical question: “How can a person be considered wise if\nthat person does not dwell in benevolence?” (4.1). One\nwell-known passage often cited to imply Confucius is agnostic about\nthe world of the spirits is more literally about how wisdom allows an\noutsider to present himself in a way appropriate to the people on\nwhose behalf he is working:  \nWhen working for what is right for the common people, to show\nreverence for the ghosts and spirits while maintaining one’s\ndistance may be deemed wisdom. (6.22)  \nThe context for this sort of appraisal is usually official service,\nand wisdom is often attributed to valued ministers or advisors to sage\nrulers. \nIn certain dialogues, wisdom also connotes a moral discernment that\nallows the gentleman to be confident of the appropriateness of good\nactions. In the Analects, Confucius tells his disciple Zi Lu\n子路 that wisdom recognizes knowing a thing as knowing it,\nand ignorance of a thing as ignorance of it (2.17). In soliloquies\nabout several virtues, Confucius describes a wise person as never\nconfused (9.28, 14.28). While comparative philosophers have noted that\nChinese thought has nothing clearly analogous to the role of the will\nin pre-modern European philosophy, the moral discernment that is part\nof wisdom does provide actors with confidence that the moral actions\nthey have taken are correct. \nThe virtue of trustworthiness qualifies a gentleman to give advice to\na ruler, and a ruler or official to manage others. In the\nAnalects, Confucius explains it succinctly: “if one is\ntrustworthy, others will give one responsibilities” (17.6, cf.\n20.1). While trustworthiness may be rooted in\nthe proper expression of friendship between those of the same status (1.4, 5.26),\nit is also valuable in interactions with those of different status. The disciple Zi Xia 子夏 explains its effect on superiors and\nsubordinates: when advising a ruler, without trustworthiness, the\nruler will think a gentleman is engaged in slander, and when\nadministering a state, without trustworthiness, people will think a\ngentleman is exploiting them (19.10). The implication is that a\nsincerely public-minded official would be ineffective without the\ntrust that this quality inspires. In a dialogue with a ruler from\nchapter four of Han’s Intertextual Commentary the Odes,\nConfucius explains that in employing someone, trustworthiness is\nsuperior to strength, ability to flatter, or eloquence. Being able to\nrely on someone is so important to Confucius that, when asked about\ngood government, he explained that trustworthiness was superior to\neither food or weapons, concluding: “If the people do not find the\nruler trustworthy, the state will not stand” (12.7).  \nBy the Han period, benevolence, righteousness, ritual propriety,\nwisdom and trustworthiness began to be considered as a complete set of\nhuman virtues, corresponding with other quintets of phenomena used to\ndescribe the natural world. Some texts described a level of moral\nperfection, as with the sages of antiquity, as unifying all these\nvirtues. Prior to this, it is unclear whether the possession of a\nparticular virtue entailed having all the others, although benevolence\nwas sometimes used as a more general term for a combination of one or\nmore of the other virtues (e.g.,\nAnalects 17.6). At other times, Confucius presented\nindividual virtues as expressions of goodness in particular domains of\nlife. Early Confucius dialogues are embedded in concrete situations,\nand so resist attempts to distill them into more abstract principles\nof morality. As a result, descriptions of the virtues are embedded in\nanecdotes about the exemplary individuals whose character traits the\ndialogues encourage their audience to develop. Confucius taught that\nthe measure of a good action was whether it was an expression of the\nactor’s virtue, something his lessons share with those of\nphilosophies like Aristotle’s that are generally described as\n“virtue ethics”. A modern evaluation of the teachings of Confucius as\na “virtue ethics” is articulated in Bryan W. Van\nNorden’s Virtue Ethics and Consequentialism in Early Chinese\nPhilosophy, which pays particular attention to analogies between\nthe way of Confucius and Aristotle’s “good life”.\nThe nature of the available source materials about Confucius, however,\nmeans that the diverse texts from early China lack the systematization\nof a work like Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics. \nThe five virtues described above are not the only ones of which\nConfucius spoke. He discussed loyalty (zhong 忠), which\nat one point is described as the minister’s behavior toward a\nritually proper ruler (3.19). He said that courage (yong\n勇) is what compels one to act once one has seen where\nrighteousness lies (2.24).  Another term sometimes translated as\n“virtue” (de 德), is usually used to\ndescribe the authority of a ruler that grows out of goodness or favor\nto others, and is a key term in many of the social and political works\ndiscussed in the following section. Yet going through a list of all\nthe virtues in the early sources is not sufficient to describe the\nentirety of the moral universe associated with Confucius. \nThe presence of themes in the Analects like the ruler’s\nexceptional influence as a moral exemplar, the importance of judging\npeople by their deeds rather than their words (1.3, 2.10, 5.10), or\neven the protection of the culture of Zhou by higher powers (9.5), all\nhighlight the unsystematic nature of the text and underscore that\nteaching others how to cultivate the virtues is a key aspect, but only\na part, of the ethical ideal of Confucius. Yet there is also a conundrum inherent in any attempt to derive abstract moral rules from the mostly dialogical form of the Analects, that is, the problem of whether the situational context and conversation partner is integral to evaluating the statements of Confucius. \nA historically notable example of an attempt to find a generalized moral rule in the Analects is the reading of a pair of\npassages that use a formulation similar to that of the “Golden\nRule” of the Christian Bible (Matthew 7:12 and Luke 6:31) to\ndescribe benevolence: “Do not impose upon others those things\nthat you yourself do not desire” (12.2, cf. 5.12, 15.24). Read\nas axiomatic moral imperatives, these passages differ from the kind of\nexemplar-based and situational conversations about morality usually\nfound in the Analects. For this reason, some scholars,\nincluding E. Bruce Brooks, believe these passages to be\ninterpolations. While they are not wholly inconsistent with the way\nthat benevolence is described in early texts, their\ninterpretation as abstract principles has been influenced by their perceived similarity to the Biblical examples. In\nthe Records of Ritual, a slightly different formulation of a\nrule about self and others is presented as not universal in its scope,\nbut rather as descriptive of how the exemplary ruler influences the\npeople. In common with other early texts, the Analects\ndescribes how the moral transformation of society relies on the\npositive example of the ruler, comparing the influence of the\ngentleman on the people to the way the wind blows on the grass,\nforcing it to bend (12.19). In a similar vein, after discussing how the personal\nqualities of rulers of the past determined whether or not their\nsubjects could morally transform, the Records of Ritual\nexpresses its principle of reflexivity:  \nThat is why the gentleman only seeks things in others that he or she\npersonally possesses. [The gentleman] only condemns things in others\nthat he or she personally lacks. (“Daxue”\n大學)  \nThis is a point about the efficacy of moral suasion, saying that a\nruler cannot expect to reform society solely by command since it is\nonly the ruler’s personal example that can transform others. For\nthis reason, the ruler should not compel behaviors from his subjects\nto which he or she would not personally assent, something rather\ndifferent from the “Golden Rule”. \nHistorically, however, views that Confucius was inspired by the same Natural Theology as Christians, or that philosophers are naturally concerned with the generalization of moral imperatives, have argued in favor of a closer identification with the “Golden Rule,” a fact that illustrates the interpretative conundrum arising from the formal aspects of the Analects.  \nEarly Zhou political philosophy as represented in the Classic of\nOdes and the Classic of Documents centered on moral\njustification for political authority based on the doctrine of the\n“Mandate of Heaven” (tianming\n天命). This view was that the sage’s virtue\n(de) attracted the attention of the anthropomorphized cosmic\npower usually translated as “Heaven” (tian\n天), which supported the sage’s rise to political\nauthority. These canonical texts argued that political success or\nfailure is a function of moral quality, evidenced by actions such as\nproper ritual performance, on the part of the ruler. Confucius drew on\nthese classics and adapted the classical view of moral authority in\nimportant ways, connecting it to a normative picture of\nsociety. Positing a parallel between the nature of reciprocal\nresponsibilities of individuals in different roles in two domains of\nsocial organization, in the Analects Confucius linked filial piety in the family to\nloyalty in the political realm:  \nIt is rare for a person who is filially pious to his parents and older\nsiblings to be inclined to rebel against his superiors… Filial\npiety to parents and elder siblings may be considered the root of a\nperson. (1.2)  \nThis section examines Confucius’s social and political\nphilosophy, beginning with the central role of his analysis of the\ntraditional norm of filial piety. \nJust as Confucius analyzed the psychology of ritual performance and\nrelated it to individual moral development, his discussion of filial\npiety was another example of the development and adaptation of a\nparticular classical cultural pattern to a wider philosophical context\nand set of concerns. Originally limited to descriptions of sacrifice\nto ancestors in the context of hereditary kinship groups, a more\nextended meaning of “filial piety” was used to describe\nthe sage king Shun’s 舜 (trad. r. 2256–2205 BCE)\ntreatment of his living father in the Classic of\nDocuments. Despite humble origins, Shun’s filial piety was\nrecognized as a quality that signaled he would be a suitable successor\nfor the sage king Yao 堯 (trad.  r. 2357–2256\nBCE). Confucius in the Analects praised the ancient sage\nkings at great length, and the sage king Yu 禹 for his filial\npiety in the context of sacrifice (8.21). However, he used the term\nfilial piety to mean both sacrificial mastery and behaving\nappropriately to one’s parents. In a conversation with one of\nhis disciples he explains that filial piety meant “not\ncontesting”, and that it entailed:  \nwhile one’s parents were alive, serving them in a ritually\nproper way, and after one’s parents died, burying them and\nsacrificing to them in a ritually proper way. (2.5)  \nIn rationalizing the moral content of legacies of the past like the\nthree-year mourning period after the death of a parent, Confucius\nreasoned that for three years a filially pious child should not alter\na parent’s way (4.20, cf. 19.18), and explains the origin of\nlength of the three-year mourning period to be the length of time that\nthe parents had given their infant child support (17.21). This\nadaptation of filial piety to connote the proper way for a gentleman\nto behave both inside and outside the home was a generalization of a\npattern of behavior that had once been specific to the family. \nIntellectual historian Chen Lai 陈来 has identified two\nsets of ideal traits that became hybridized in the late Warring States\nperiod. The first set of qualities describes the virtue of the ruler\ncoming out of politically-oriented descriptions of figures like King\nWen of Zhou, including uprightness (zhi 直) and\nfortitude (gang 剛).  The second set of qualities is\nbased on bonds specific to kinship groups, including filial piety and\nkindness (ci 慈).  As kinship groups were subordinated\nto larger political units, texts began to exhibit hybrid lists of\nideal qualities that drew from both sets.  Consequently, Confucius had\nto effectively integrate clan priorities and state priorities, a\nconciliation illustrated in\nHan’s Intertextual Commentary the Odes by his\ninsistence that filial piety is not simply deference to elders. When\nhis disciple Zengzi 曾子 submitted to a severe beating from his\nfather’s staff in punishment for an offense, Confucius chastises\nZengzi, saying that even the sage king Shun would not have submitted\nto a beating so severe. He goes on to explain that a child has a dual\nset of duties, to both a father and ruler, the former filial piety and\nthe other loyalty. Therefore, protecting one’s body is a duty to\nthe ruler and a counterweight to a duty to submit to one’s\nparent (8). In the Classic of Filial Piety (Xiaojing\n孝經), similar reasoning is applied to a redefinition of filial\npiety that rejects behaviors like such extreme submission because\nprotecting one’s body is a duty to one’s parents. This\nsort of qualification suggests that as filial piety moved further\noutside its original family context, it had to be qualified to be integrated\ninto a view that valorized multiple character traits. \nSince filial piety was based on a fundamental relationship defined\nwithin the family, one’s family role and state role could\nconflict. A Classic of Documents text spells out the possible\nconflict between loyalty to a ruler and filial piety toward a father\n(“Cai Zhong zhi ming”\n蔡仲之命), a trade-off similar to a story in\nthe Analects about a man named Zhi Gong 直躬\n(Upright Gong) who testified that his father stole a sheep. Although\nConfucius acknowledged that theft injures social order, he judged\nUpright Gong to have failed to be truly “upright” in a\nsense that balances the imperative to testify with special\nconsideration for members of his kinship group:\n \nIn my circle, being upright differs from this. A father would conceal\nsuch a thing on behalf of his son, and a son would conceal it on\nbehalf of his father. Uprightness is found in this. (13.18)  \nIn this way, too, Confucius was adapting filial piety to a wider\nmanifold of moral behaviors, honing his answer to the question of how\na child balances responsibility to family and loyalty to the state.\nWhile these two traits may conflict with one and other, Sociologist\nRobert Bellah, in his study of Tokugawa and modern Japan, noted how\nthe structural similarity between loyalty and filial piety led to\ntheir both being promoted by the state as interlinked ideals that\nlocated each person in dual networks of responsibility. Confucius was\nmaking this claim when he connected filial piety to the propensity to\nbe loyal to superiors (1.2). Statements like “filial piety is\nthe root of virtuous action” from the Classic of Filial\nPiety connect loyalty and the kind of action that\nsignals the personal virtue that justifies political authority, as in\nthe historical precedent of the sage king Shun. \nOf the classical sources from which Confucius drew, two were\nparticularly influential in discussions of political legitimation. The\nClassic of Odes consists of 305 Zhou period regulated lyrics\n(hence the several translations “songs”,\n“odes”, or “poems”) and became numbered as one\nof the Five Classics (Wujing) in the Han dynasty. Critical to\na number of these lyrics is the celebration of King Wen of\nZhou’s overthrow of the Shang, which is an example of a virtuous\nperson seizing the “Mandate of Heaven”:  \nThis King Wen of ours, his prudent heart was well-ordered. He shone in\nserving the High God, and thus enjoyed much good fortune. Unswerving\nin his virtue, he came to hold the domains all around. (“Daming” 大明)  \nThe Zhou political theory expressed in this passage is based on the\nidea of a limited moral universe that may not reward a virtuous person\nin isolation, but in which the High God (Shangdi\n上帝, Di 帝) or Heaven will intercede to\nreplace a bad ruler with a person of exceptional\nvirtue. The Classic of Documents is a collection that\nincludes orations attributed to the sage rulers of the past and their\nministers, and its arguments often concern moral authority with a\nfocus on the methods and character of exemplary rulers of the past.\nThe chapter “Announcement of Kang” (“Kanggao” 康誥) is addressed to one of the sons of\nKing Wen, and provides him with a guide for behaving as sage ruler as\nwell as with methods that had been empirically proven successful by\nthose rulers. When it comes to the mandate inherited from King Wen,\nthe chapter insists that the mandate is not unchanging, and so as\nruler the son must always be mindful of it when deciding how to\nact. Further, it is not always possible to understand Heaven, but the\n“feelings of the people are visible”, and so the ruler\nmust care for his subjects. The Zhou political view that Confucius\ninherited was based on supernatural intercession to place a person\nwith personal virtue in charge of the state, but over time the\nemphasis shifted to the way that the effects of good government could\nbe viewed as proof of a continuing moral justification for that\nplacement. \nConfucius himself arguably served as a historical counterexample to the\nclassical “Mandate of Heaven” theory, calling into question the\ndirect nature of the support given by Heaven to the person with\nvirtue. The Han period Records of the Historian biography of\nConfucius described him as possessing all the personal qualities\nneeded to govern well, but wandering from state to state because those\nqualities had not been recognized. When his favorite disciple died,\nthe Analects records Confucius saying that “Heaven has\nforsaken me!” (11.9). Wang Chong’s 王充\n(27–c.97 CE)\nBalanced Discussions (Lunheng 論衡) uses the phrase\n“uncrowned king” (suwang 素王) to describe the\ntragic situation: “Confucius did not rule as king, but his work\nas uncrowned king may be seen in the Spring and Autumn\nAnnals” (80). The view that through his writings Confucius\ncould prepare the world for the government of a future sage king\nbecame a central part of Confucius lore that has colored the reception\nof his writings since, especially in works related to the Spring\nand Autumn Annals and its Gongyang Commentary.  The\nbiography of Confucius reinforced the tragic cosmological picture that\npersonal virtue did not always guarantee success. Even when\nHeaven’s support is cited in the Analects, it is not a\nmatter of direct intercession, but expressed through personal virtue\nor cultural patterns: “Heaven gave birth to the virtue in me, so\nwhat can Huan Tui 桓魋 do to me?” (7.23, cf. 9.5). As\nRobert Eno has pointed out, the concept of Heaven also came to be\nincreasingly naturalized in passages like “what need does Heaven\nhave to speak?” (17.19). Changing views of the scope of\nHeaven’s activity and the ways human beings may have knowledge\nof that activity fostered a change in the role of Heaven in political\ntheory. \nMost often, in dialogues with the rulers of his time, references to\nHeaven were occasions for Confucius to encourage rulers to remain\nattentive to their personal moral development and treat their subjects\nfairly. In integrating the classical legacy of the “Mandate of\nHeaven” that applied specifically to the ruler or “Son of\nHeaven” (tianzi 天子), with moral teachings\nthat were directed to a wider audience, the nature of Heaven’s\nintercession came to be understood differently. In the\nAnalects and writings like those attributed to Mencius,\ndescriptions of virtue were often adapted to contexts such as the\nconduct of lesser officials and the navigation of everyday life.\nKwong-Loi Shun notes that in such contexts, the influence of Heaven\nremained as an explanation of both what happened outside of human\ncontrol, like political success or lifespan, and of the source of the\nethical ideal. In the Analects, the gentleman’s awe of\nHeaven is combined with an awe of the words of the sages (16.8), and\nwhen Confucius explains the Zhou theory of the “mandate of\nHeaven” in the Elder Dai’s Records of Ritual, he\ndoes so in order to explain how the signs of a well-ordered society\ndemonstrate that the ruler’s “virtue matches Heaven”\n(“Shaojian” 少閒). Heaven is still\nubiquitous in the responses of Confucius to questions from rulers, but\nthe focus of the responses was not on Heaven’s direct\nintercession but rather the ruler’s demonstration of his\npersonal moral qualities. \nIn this way, personal qualities of modesty, filial piety or respect\nfor the elders were seen as proof of fitness to serve in an official\ncapacity. Qualification to rule was demonstrated by proper behavior in\nthe social roles defined by the “five relationships”\n(wulun 五倫), a formulation seen in the writings\nof Mencius that became a key feature of the interpretation of works\nassociated with Confucius in the Han dynasty. The Western Han emperors\nwere members of the Liu clan, and works like the Guliang\nCommentary (Guliang zhuan\n穀梁傳) to the Spring and Autumn Annals emphasized\nnormative family behavior grounded in the five relationships, which were\n(here, adapted to include mothers and sisters): ruler and subject,\nparent and child, husband and wife, siblings, and friends. Writing\nwith particular reference to the Classic of Filial Piety,\nHenry Rosemont and Roger Ames argue that prescribed social roles are a\ndefining characteristic of the “Confucian tradition”, and\nthat such roles were normative guides to appropriate conduct. They\ncontrast this with the “virtue ethics” approach they say\nrequires rational calculation to determine moral conduct, while filial\npiety is simply a matter of meeting one’s family obligations.\nJust as the five virtues were placed at the center of later theories\nof moral development, once social roles became systematized in this\nway, selected situational teachings of Confucius consistent with them\ncould become the basis of more abstract, systematic moral theories.\nYet this could not have happened without the adaptation of the\nabstract classical political theory of “Heaven’s\nmandate”, a doctrine that originally supported the ruling clan,\nto argue that Heaven’s influence was expressed through\nparticular concrete expressions of individual virtue. As a result of\nthis adaptation in writings associated with Confucius, the\nruler’s conduct of imperial rituals, performance of filial\npiety, or other demonstrations of personal virtue provided proof of\nmoral fitness that legitimated his political authority. As with the\nrituals and the virtues, filial piety and the mandate of Heaven were\ntransformed as they were integrated with the classics through the\nvoices of Confucius and the rulers and disciples of his era. \nEarlier, the usage of “Confucius” as a metonym for\nChinese traditional culture was introduced as a feature of the modern period. Yet the\ncomplexity of the philosophical views associated with\nConfucius—encompassing ethical ideals developed out of a\nsophisticated view of the effects of ritual and music on the\nperformer’s psychology, robust descriptions of the attitudes of traditional exemplars across diverse life contexts, and the abstraction of normative behaviors in the family and state—is due in part to the\nfact that this metonymic usage was to some degree already the case in\nthe Han period. By that time, the teachings of Confucius had gone\nthrough several centuries of gestation, and dialogues and quotations\nfashioned at different points over that time circulated and mixed. Put\nslightly differently, Confucius read the traditional culture of the\nhalcyon Zhou period in a particular way, but this reading was\ncontinuously reflected and refracted through different lenses during\nthe Pre-Imperial period, prior to the results being fixed in diverse early\nImperial period sources like the Analects, the\nRecords of Ritual, and the Records of the Historian.\nWhat remains is the work of the hand of Confucius, but also of his\n“school”, and even sometimes of his opponents during the\ncenturies that his philosophy underwent elaboration and drift. This process of accretion and elaboration is\nnot uncommon for pre-modern writings, and the resulting breadth and depth explains, at\nleast in part, why the voice of Confucius retained primacy in\npre-modern Chinese philosophical conversations as well as in many modern\ndebates about the role of traditional East Asian culture.","contact.mail":"mark.cs@berkeley.edu","contact.domain":"berkeley.edu"}]
