When a person\nsays that someone is treating him merely as a means, for\nexample, he often implies that she is failing to abide by a moral\nnorm. Ethically disapproving judgments that a person is “just\nusing” or sometimes simply “using” another are\ncommon in everyday discourse (e.g., Goldman & Schmidt 2018).\nAuthors appeal to the idea that research on human subjects (Levine\n2007: 140; Van der Graaf and Van Delden 2012), management of employees\n(Haywood 1918: 217), and criminal punishment (Duff 1986:\n178–179) is wrong if it involves treating persons merely as\nmeans. The notion that treating people in that way is morally\nproblematic has appeared in debate regarding terrorism (Card 2010:\n131), pornography (Baird & Rosenbaum 1998: 103, 106), and\nsurrogate motherhood (Macklin 1994: 64). However, treating others as\nmeans or, equivalently, using them is frequently morally permissible.\nWaiters use customers to get tips; customers treat waiters as means to\ncuisine; professors use students to test their ideas; students use\nprofessors to gain expertise, and so forth. Under what conditions is\nusing another wrong? Philosophers since Kant have tried to answer this\nquestion, at least in part, by offering accounts of when a person uses\nanother and does or does not just use the other, or,\nequivalently, treat him merely as a means. These accounts\ntend to be controversial. Precise sets of conditions for treating (or\nnot treating) persons merely as means seem to have implications that\nto some extent clash with everyday understanding of doing so.\nMoreover, for Kantians, the prohibition on treating persons merely as\na means is a moral constraint: it limits what we may do, even in the\nservice of promoting the overall good. If a surgeon extracting vital\norgans from an unwilling “donor” would maximize the good,\nsay, by preserving the lives of five people desperate for transplants,\nshe would be treating the donor merely as a means and thereby acting\nwrongly, Kantians would say. Kant himself suggests that this\nconstraint is absolute. The principle Kant deems to be the supreme\nprinciple of morality, the categorical imperative, deems morally wrong\nall actions that treat persons merely as means. But is it plausible to\nhold that all such actions are wrong? Upon reflection, is it even\nplausible to hold that to treat persons merely as means is, typically,\nto act wrongly, rather than just to have an ethically\ninappropriate attitude towards them?\n\n\nSeveral concepts in ethics overlap with that of treating persons\nmerely as means. For example, to say that a person is exploiting or\nmanipulating another is often to imply that the person is using the\nother in a morally problematic\n way.[1]\n Prototypical cases of coercion such as muggings are also cases of a\nperson, the mugger, treating another, the victim, merely as a means.\nOther concepts that intersect with that of treating someone merely as\na means include those of commodifying and of objectifying a person\n(Davis 1984: 392). Commodifying someone can involve using her as one\nwould use a mere thing, instead of treating her, as one ought, as a\nbeing of higher status, for example.\n\n\nThis article does not try to untangle the relations between treating\npersons merely as means and these other concepts. It focuses on the\nnotion(s), inspired by Kant and seemingly embraced in ordinary moral\ndiscourse, of treating persons, especially treating others, merely as\nmeans. In the idiom of the article, to say that someone is treating\nanother as a means or, equivalently, using him, implies in itself no\nmoral disapproval. To say that someone is treating a person\nmerely as a means or, equivalently, just using him,\nsuggests that she is using the other in a way subject to ethical\ncriticism. The entry begins by focusing on the roots in Kant of\ndiscussion of treating persons merely as means. It then considers\n(morally neutral) notions of using another or treating him as a means,\nnotions that are less straightforward than it might seem. The third\nsection focuses on attempts to specify sufficient conditions for\ntreating another merely as a means, some of which Kant himself\nsuggests. According to Kant, to treat another merely as a means is to\ndo something morally impermissible; it is to act wrongly. The next\nsection examines challenges to this claim. Finally, the article\nconsiders accounts of when a person uses another, but not merely as a\nmeans.\n\nKant sets forth several formulations of the categorical imperative,\nthat is, the principle he holds to be the supreme principle of\nmorality. One formulation, often called the “Formula of\nHumanity” states:  \nSo act that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the\nperson of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely\nas a means. (Kant 1785: 429, italics \n removed)[2] \nThe Formula of Humanity contains the command that we ought never to\ntreat persons merely as means. A few points regarding this command are\nhelpful to keep in view. First, Kant holds that if a person treats\nsomeone merely as a means, then she acts wrongly. The Formula of\nHumanity encompasses an absolute constraint against treating persons\nmerely as means. Second, Kant does not hold that if in acting a person\nrefrains from treating anyone merely as a means, then she acts rightly\n(Kant 1797: 395). A person can, for example, act wrongly in\nKant’s view by expressing contempt for another, even if she is\nnot using him at all (Kant 1797: 462–464). She would be acting\nwrongly by failing to treat the other as an end in himself, rather\nthan by treating him merely as a means. A third related point is that,\naccording to Kant, it is both a necessary and a sufficient condition\nfor one’s treating persons in a morally permissible way that one\ntreat them as ends in themselves (Hill 1992: 41–42). Some\nKantians, especially those engaged primarily in interpretation, rather\nthan reconstruction, of his views thus understandably hold that far\nmore important than understanding his position on treating persons\nmerely as means is understanding his account of treating persons as\nends in themselves (Wood 1999, 143). Fourth, Kant holds that a person\ncan treat herself merely as a means. If a person acts contrary to\ncertain “perfect duties to oneself” (Kant 1797: 421),\nincluding her duty not to kill herself (422–423), not to defile\nherself by lust (424–425), and not to lie (429–430), then\nshe treats herself merely as a means, thereby contravening the Formula\nof Humanity. It is difficult to discern how, according to Kant, one\ntreats oneself merely as a means in violating these duties (Kerstein\n2008; Timmons 2017: Ch. 7). How, for example, does a person’s\nlying to another amount to her treating herself merely as a means? \nIn any case, this article’s focus is on treating others merely\nas means. Doing that is widely discussed as a possible violation of a\nmoral constraint. More specifically, the article explores when someone\nuses another and either treats or refrains from treating the other\nmerely as a means. It concentrates on concepts that seem to have roots\nin Kant’s work, but that are familiar from ordinary moral\n discourse.[3]\n Kant himself devotes little discussion to clarifying the notion of\ntreating others merely as\n means.[4]\n Yet as is apparent below, some of his remarks have been a springboard\nfor detailed accounts of the notion. \nOne salient issue outside the article’s purview is that of the\nscope of “others” in the prescription not to treat others\nmerely as means. Does Kant embrace among these others all genetically\nhuman beings, including human embryos and individuals in a persistent\nvegetative state, or does he limit the others to beings who have\ncertain capacities, for example, that to set and rationally pursue\nends (Kain 2009; Sussman 2001)? How should Kant or other theorists set\nthe scope of those whom we ought not to treat merely as means? Should\nwe include some non-human animals (e.g., chimpanzees or dolphins)\namong them? How should we determine to whom to grant this moral\nstatus?  \nIn order to treat another merely as a means or just\nuse him, an agent must use the other or treat him as a means. But when\ndoes someone count as doing that? As noted, using others or treating\nthem as means is often morally permissible. In everyday discourse,\nexpressions such as “She used me” can mean she\njust used me, or treated me merely as a means and so\ncan imply a negative evaluation of action or attitude. But for our\npurposes talk of a person using another or treating him as a means\nimplies no such moral judgment. \nAccounts of treating others merely as means sometimes leave implicit\nthe notions of using another they rely on. Some points regarding what\nusing another does or does not amount to seem uncontroversial. It does\nnot seem sufficient for us to count as using another as a means that\nwe benefit from what the other has done (Nozick 1974: 31–32).\nIf, on her usual route, a runner derives enjoyment from the singing of\na stranger who happens to be walking by, she does not appear to be\ntreating the stranger as a means. Moreover, not all cases of an\nagent’s intentionally doing something in response to another are\ncases of her using the other as a means. If someone frowns at another\napproaching, for example, he might not thereby be using the other at\nall; he might simply be expressing that the other is unwelcome. \nHowever, inquiry reveals challenges in specifying what using another\namounts to. We might say that an agent uses another or, equivalently,\ntreats her as a means just in case the agent intentionally does\nsomething to the other in order to secure or as a part of securing one\nof his ends (Kerstein 2009: 166). For example, a passenger uses a bus\ndriver if he boards her bus in order to get across town; a wife treats\nher husband as a means if she lies to him so that his birthday party\nwill be a surprise; and a victim treats a mugger as a means if she\npunches him in order to escape from his grasp. In contrast, a pilot\nwho drops bombs solely in order to kill enemy combatants might foresee\nthat innocent bystanders will be harmed. Yet if he does not\nintentionally do anything to the bystanders, then he does not treat\nthem as means, according to this\n account.[5] \nBut does the account count too much as treating another as a means?\nSuppose that an usher at a concert is trying to prevent a small child\nfrom falling through railing on a balcony. She pushes a spectator out\nof the way to get to the child. The specification we are considering\nimplies that the usher has used the spectator as a means; for she has\nintentionally done something to her (i.e., pushed her aside) in order\nto attain an end (i.e., to get to the child). Some might say that the\nusher has treated the spectator in some way, namely, as an obstacle to\nbe displaced. Yet she has not used the spectator. \nIn order for an agent to count as using another, it is not enough that\nshe do something to the other in order to realize some end of hers,\nsome have suggested. She must also intend the presence or\nparticipation of some aspect of the other to contribute to the\nend’s realization (Scanlon 2008: 106–107; Guerrero 2016:\n779). The usher does not intend the spectator’s presence or\nparticipation to play any role in her preventing the child from\nfalling. She thinks of her simply as “in the way”. On one\naccount, an agent uses another (or, equivalently, uses or treats\nanother as a means) if and only if she intentionally does something to\nor with the other in order to realize her end, and she intends the\npresence or participation of the other to contribute to the\nend’s realization (Kerstein 2013: 58). On this account, an agent\ncan count as using another when she is striving to benefit him. For\nexample, a physician giving a patient a treatment to save his life is\nusing the patient. Some find this implication of the account\nimplausible (Parfit 2011:\n 222).[6]\n Others do not, pointing to cases such as that of a physician using a\npatient in a study of a new drug in order to ameliorate the\npatient’s condition. \nIn any case, consistent with this account, an agent might use another\nthrough using the other’s rational, emotional, or physical\ncapacities. A tourist might ask someone for directions, using the\nother’s knowledge to get to his destination; a politician might\nuse his constituents’ fear of crime to gain their support for\nmore spending on law enforcement; a doctor might use a vein from a\npatient’s leg to repair her heart. One important question left\nunanswered by this and other accounts of treating another as a means\nis one of scope. For example, does an agent use another if he uses biospecimens (e.g., cells) or information (e.g., concerning social media\nactivity) derived from the other? If so, then the scope of a\nconstraint on treating others merely as means would extend to the\npractices of biobanks and technology companies. \nMuch debate concerning what it means to treat others merely as means\nstems from a single passage in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics\nof Morals. Kant is attempting to demonstrate that the Formula of\nHumanity generates a duty not to make false promises: \nHe who has it in mind to make a false promise to others sees at once\nthat he wants to make use of another human being merely as a\nmeans, without the other at the same time containing in himself\nthe end. For, he whom I want to use for my purposes by such a promise\ncannot possibly agree to my way of behaving toward him, and so himself\ncontain the end of this action. (1785: 429–430) \nIn these brief remarks, Kant hints at various ways in which we might\nunderstand conditions for treating another merely as a means. We might\nunderstand them in terms of the other’s inability to share the\nagent’s end in using him or to consent to her using him, for\nexample. In this section, we discuss elaborations of these ways (and\nothers) of formulating sufficient conditions for someone who is using\nanother to be treating this other merely as a means. \nOn the basis of Kant’s remarks, we might claim that if another\ncannot “contain the end” of an agent’s action, that\nis, share the end the agent is pursuing in using her, then the agent\ntreats the other merely as a means. Two agents presumably share an end\njust in case they are both trying, or have chosen to try, to realize\nthis end. But what, precisely, does it mean to say that two agents\ncannot share an end? Returning to the example at hand, what\ndoes it mean to say that the promisee cannot share the\npromisor’s end? From the outset, it is important to specify\nprecisely which of the promisor’s ends the promisee cannot\nshare. It is presumably the promisor’s end of getting money from\nthe promisee without ever paying it back. The promisor’s\nultimate end might be one that the two can share (e.g., that\nof curing cancer). What sense of ‘cannot’ would be\nplausible to invoke in maintaining that a promisee cannot share a\nfalse promisor’s end? \nAccording to one interpretation of Kant, the promisee cannot share the\npromisor’s end in that it is logically impossible for him to do\nso (Hill 2002: 69–70). Suppose the promisor, a borrower, has the end of getting\nmoney from the promisee, a lender, without ever paying it back. At the\ntime he makes a loan on the basis of this promise, the lender cannot\nhimself share the end of the borrower’s getting the money from\nhim without ever paying it back, goes this reading. If the lender\nshared the borrower’s end, then he would not really be making a\nloan. For according to our practice, it belongs to the very concept of\nmaking a loan, as opposed, say, to giving money away, that one believe\nthat what one disburses will be repaid. \nThis interpretation of the false promising case leads naturally to the\nview that a sufficient condition for an agent’s treating another\nmerely as a means is that it is logically impossible for the other to\nshare the end the agent is pursuing in using her in some way. However,\nthis proposed sufficient condition might fail to register as treating\nothers merely as means paradigmatic cases of doing so (Kerstein 2009:\n167–168). Take, for example, a loiterer who threatens an\ninnocent passerby with a gun in order to get $100. It would presumably\nbe good if a sufficient condition for treating another merely as a\nmeans yielded the conclusion that the loiterer is treating the\npasserby merely as a means; for he is mugging her, which, intuitively\nspeaking, seems to be a clear case of treating another merely as a\nmeans. One might question whether the proposed sufficient condition\ndoes this. Even highly unlikely events are logically possible. It is\nimprobable, but still logically possible, that the passerby shares the\nloiterer’s end of his getting $100, one might argue. For\nexample, the passerby might aim to give $100 to the loiterer, but not\nrecognize him when he threatens her and so hand over her money to him\nas a result of his threat. If this possibility is realized, then the\naccount would not count the loiterer as treating the passerby merely\nas a means. One might also argue that in the case of the false\npromise, it is improbable, but still logically possible, that the\nlender loans money to a borrower (and thereby believes that it will be\nrepaid), all the while sharing the borrower’s end that she get\nmoney from him (the lender) without paying it back. For example, the\nlender might believe that the borrower will pay him back, but share\nher end of her getting money from him without repaying it because he\nbelieves that if she does, she will bring about something he covets,\nnamely, the demise of her reputation. Some philosophers insist,\nhowever, that this sort of scenario is not logically possible; for in\norder to be making a loan to another, a person must not only believe\nthat his money will be repaid, but want and hope that it will be\n(Papadaki 2016: 78), they say. If these philosophers’ views are\nplausible, the proposed sufficient condition in view would deem as\ninstances of treating others merely as means a range of actions many\nenvisage as such. \nAccording to a different interpretation of Kant, another cannot share\nthe end an agent pursues in using him in some way if how the agent\nbehaves “prevents [the other] from choosing whether to\ncontribute to the realization of that end or not” (Korsgaard\n1996: 139). The lender in our example cannot share the\nborrower’s end of getting money without ever repaying it; for\nthe borrower’s false promise obscures his end and thus prevents\nthe lender from choosing whether to contribute to it. \nThis reading of possible end sharing might have implausible\nimplications when incorporated into a principle according to which a\nperson who uses another treats the other merely as a means if the\nother cannot share the end she is pursuing in using him (Kerstein\n2013: 63). Consider young men hiking in the Rocky Mountains for the\nfirst time who find themselves on a mountain in late afternoon without\nwater and unsure of the way down. To their relief, they spot another\nhiker, someone whom they saw park his car in the same area below. They\nfollow him, using his knowledge of the terrain to get down the\nmountain safely. The young men realize that they could, but choose not\nto, tell the hiker that they are following him. Out of embarrassment\nfor their dependence on him, they ensure that they remain undetected.\nThe way they act prevents the man from choosing whether to contribute\nto the realization of their end. According to the notion of possible\nend sharing we are here considering, we might have to embrace a view\nthat some find implausible: Since the hiker cannot share the young\nmen’s end, they are treating him merely as a means and thereby\nacting wrongly. To avoid this implication, one might affirm the\nfollowing: a person cannot share the end an agent pursues in using him\nif the agent’s behavior prevents the person from choosing\nwhether to contribute to the realization of that end and the person\nhas a right not to be prevented from making this choice (Papadaki\n2016: 80). If the hiker fails to have a right not to be prevented from\nchoosing whether to contribute to the young men getting safely down\nthe mountain, then they do not treat him merely as a means according\nto the amended account. Of course, this amendment invites questions as\nto when a person has such a right, as well as making the account of\ntreating others merely as means depend on an account of moral rights\nin a way that Korsgaard (or Kant) might not have intended.  \nThe allusion in the false promising passage to possible end sharing is\nsubject to a third interpretation: the promisee cannot share the\npromisor’s end in that it would be practically irrational for\nher to do so. In typical cases, it would be irrational for the\npromisee to try to realize the end of making a loan that is never to\nbe repaid. This end’s being brought about would prevent him from\nrealizing other ends he is pursuing, ends such as paying rent, buying\ngroceries, or simply getting his money back. \nThe notion of practical irrationality at work here seems implicit in\nthe Groundwork. Kant there (1785: 413–418) introduces a\nprinciple that Thomas Hill, Jr. calls (1992: 17–37) “the\nhypothetical imperative”: If you will an end, then you ought to\nwill the means to it that are necessary and in your power, or give up\nwilling the end. Willing an end presumably involves setting it and\nattempting to realize it. According to Kant, the hypothetical\nimperative is a principle of reason: all of us are rationally\ncompelled to conform to this principle. An agent would be violating\nthe hypothetical imperative and thus acting irrationally by willing an\nend yet, at the same time, willing another end, the attainment of\nwhich would, he is aware, make it impossible for him to take the\notherwise available and necessary means to his original end. An agent\nwould violate the hypothetical imperative, for example, by willing now\nto buy a house and yet, at the same time, willing to use the money he\nknows he needs for the down payment to make a gift to his niece. If he\nwilled to make the gift, he would be failing to will the necessary\nmeans in his power to buy the house. The Kantian hypothetical\nimperative implies that it is irrational to will to be thwarted in\nattaining ends that one is pursuing. In typical cases, if a promisee\nwilled the end of a false promisor, she would be doing just that. \nThere are two things that an agent who has willed something can do\nwhich would bring his action into compliance with the hypothetical\nimperative. He can either will the means that are necessary and in his\npower to the end (which, of course, would rule out his willing to be\nthwarted in attaining the end) or he can give up willing the end. For\nexample, the hypothetical imperative would not imply that it was\nirrational for the person described above to cease willing now to buy\na house and instead use the money that he knows would be required as a\ndown payment on it to make a gift to his niece. \nA person cannot share an agent’s end, according to this third\naccount, if: \nThe person has an end such that his pursuing it at the same time that\nhe pursues the agent’s end would violate the hypothetical\nimperative, and the person would be unwilling to give up pursuing this\nend, even if he was aware of the likely effects of the agent’s\nsuccessful pursuit of her end. \nBy way of illustration, suppose that a doctor plans to use a healthy\npatient to obtain a heart and lungs for transplant, that is, to\nextract them from him in an operation that would kill him. We can\nimagine that the patient has many ends, for example, that of attending\nhis daughter’s wedding. According to the hypothetical\nimperative, it would be irrational for him to pursue this end at the\nsame time he was pursuing the doctor’s end of getting from him a\nheart and lungs for transplant. The account implies that the patient\ncannot share the doctor’s end if he would be unwilling to give\nup his end of attending his daughter’s wedding against the\nbackground of an awareness of the likely effects of the doctor’s\nsuccessful pursuit of his organs (e.g., his life being lost and other\nlives being saved). \nThis notion of conditions under which a person cannot share an\nagent’s end might be included in the following account: An agent\ntreats another merely as a means if the other cannot share the\nproximate end or ends the agent is pursuing in treating him as a\nmeans. An agent’s proximate end is something she aims to bring\nabout directly from her use of the person. Her proximate end might\nalso be her ultimate end, say, if she uses another to avoid pain. But\nher proximate end might be far removed from her ultimate end. Someone\nmight, for example, use another to develop her skill as a violinist to\nearn a good living in an orchestra so she can put her little sisters\nthrough college, and so forth. The account invokes proximate ends\nbecause they are far more intimately connected to the use that brings\nthem about than ultimate ends need be. \nYet, like the other accounts we have considered, this account is\nsubject to criticism. One possible shortcoming stems from cases of\ncompetition (Kerstein 2009: 170–171). Sometimes people have the\nend of being the sole winner in a competition. A competitor pursuing\nsuch an end might, according to the account, be treating his\ncompetitor merely as a means and thus acting wrongly, even though she\nabides fully with the competition’s rules. To begin, competitors\nsometimes count as treating one another as means. To invoke one\naccount of doing so (discussed in\n §2\n above), Player A intentionally does something to her opponent,\nPlayer B, for example, tries to defeat him, which requires\nB’s presence or participation. Moreover, A’s\nproximate end in trying to defeat B might be to win top player\nfor the year; and B’s proximate end in trying to defeat\nA might also be to win top player for the year. To focus on\nA, she is using B to realize an end, namely her\n(A’s) winning top player for the year, but B\ncannot share this end. In willing that A be top player of the\nyear, B would, in effect, be willing to be thwarted in his\nattempt to win top player for the year, assuming that there can be no\ntie for top player. Finally, awareness on B’s part of the\nlikely effects of A’s successful pursuit of being the top\nplayer would presumably not result in B’s being willing\nto give up his (B’s) end of being top player. In trying\nto defeat B to be number one, A would be treating\nB merely as a means and thereby acting wrongly, the account\nseems to imply, even if A competed fairly, that is, violated\nnone of the competition’s rules. Some might find this\nimplication implausible. Sometimes becoming the best in some endeavor\ninvolves defeating (and using) competitors to do so. But defeating\n(and using) competitors to be the best, especially when they have\nfreely entered a competition, need not amount to acting wrongly, some\nmight insist. \nIn the passage on false promising, Kant references possible consent.\nHe suggests that the victim of the false promise cannot agree to the\nuse the false promisor is making of him. We might conclude that the\nvictim cannot agree on the grounds that he cannot share the\npromisor’s end; for it would, in the sense invoked above\n (§3.1.3),\n be practically irrational for him to pursue this end. There is,\nhowever, another way of interpreting the victim’s inability to\nconsent in the context of considering candidates for a plausible\nsufficient condition for an agent’s treating another merely as a\nmeans. Another account, prompted by the Groundwork passage,\nis this: An agent uses another merely as a means if the other cannot\nconsent to her use of him (O’Neill 1989:\n 113).[7]\n An agent cannot consent to being treated as a means if he does not\nhave the ability to avert his being treated as such by dissenting,\nthat is, by withholding his agreement to\n it.[8]\n If an agent deceives or coerces another, then the other’s\ndissent is “in principle ruled out” (1989: 111) and thus\nso is his consent. Suppose, for example, that an appliance\nserviceperson tricks a customer into authorizing an expensive repair.\nThe customer does not really have the opportunity to dissent to the\nperson’s action by refusing to give his consent to it. For he\ndoes not know what her action is, namely one of lying to him about\nwhat is wrong with his refrigerator. (If he did know what her action\nwas, then he would not be deceived.) Or suppose that a mugger\napproaches you on a dark street, points a gun at you, and tells you\nthat unless you give him all of your money, he will hurt you. He\nleaves you no opportunity to avert his use of you by withholding your\nconsent. Regardless of what you say, he is presumably going to use\nyou, whether it is through your handing over your wallet or his\nviolently taking it from you. Since you cannot consent to his action,\nthe mugger is treating you merely as a\n means.[9] \nThe account is subject to objections. It does not suffice for an agent\nto treat another merely as a means that the other simply be\nunable to consent to the way he is being used, some argue. If it did\nsuffice, then a passerby giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to\na collapsed jogger would be treating the jogger merely as a means and\nthus acting wrongly. But the passerby does not seem to be doing\nanything that is morally impermissible. \nIn light of this objection, someone might propose a different account:\nSuppose an agent uses another. She uses him merely as a means if\nsomething she has done or is doing to the other renders him\nunable to consent to her using him. Of course, although the collapsed\njogger has no opportunity to consent to the passerby’s giving\nhim CPR, the passerby has not put him in that position. So this\naccount avoids the unwelcome implication that the passerby treats the\ncollapsed jogger merely as a means. \nHowever, this account is also open to objection. First, it fails to\ndesignate as such some cases that we, intuitively speaking, would\nsurely classify as treating others merely as means (Kerstein 2013:\n74). Think for example of a case where one person knocks someone out\nwith a “date rape” drug. Another person, who had no\nknowledge of or involvement in drugging the victim, sexually assaults\nhim. Since this other person has not rendered the victim unable to\nconsent to his use of him, the account does not yield the conclusion\nthat he treats him merely as a means. \nThe account arguably not only fails to capture some cases of an\nagent’s treating another merely as a means, but also designates\nas such some cases of deception that, intuitively speaking, are not.\nFor example, in order to make your spouse’s birthday party a\nsurprise for her, you need to lie to your sister-in-law about your\nwhereabouts during a certain afternoon. You use her to quell your\nspouse’s suspicions regarding your plans. As you realize, if you\ntold your sister-in-law about the party, she would be unable to keep\nthe secret from your spouse. According to the account, you treat your\nsister-in-law merely as a means, since your deception leaves her with\nno opportunity to avert your use of her. This conclusion seems\nquestionable to some, albeit not to others. Here is another case of\nwhat some think of as morally permissible deception (Parfit 2011:\n178). Suppose that, in order to save the life of an innocent witness\nto a crime, you use her to pass on a lie you have told her to the\nperpetrator, Brown. If Brown did not believe the lie, he would kill\nthe witness. You realize that if you let the witness in on what was\nnecessary to save her life and told her to lie to Brown herself, she\nwould not be able to do so effectively. Your treatment of the person\nrenders impossible her consent to your use of her. But it is\nimplausible to conclude that you are treating her merely as a means,\nsome insist. \nIn these two cases, it makes sense to think that the person you are\nusing can share your ends, in the sense specified in\n §3.1.3.\n Your sister-in-law can share the end of your spouse not getting\nsuspicious regarding a surprise party, and, of course, the witness can\nshare the end of Brown’s coming to believe some lie. Perhaps\nthat is why in these cases the person’s inability to consent to\nyour use of her seems to fall short of plausibly implying that you are\nusing her merely as a means. \nA proposal for a sufficient condition for treating another merely as a\nmeans might invoke a notion of actual consent. Suppose an agent is\nusing another, the proposal might go; he is using her merely as a\nmeans if she has not consented to his use of her (Nozick 1974:\n30–31; Scanlon 2008: 107). This simple proposal faces immediate\ndifficulties. To cite one, imagine that a gravely ill young man has\narrived via ambulance at a hospital. If medical personnel give him a\ntreatment to save his life, they are presumably treating him as a\nmeans. Yet the proposed sufficient condition implies, with\nquestionable plausibility, that since he has not consented to the\ntreatment, they are treating him merely as a means. A slightly more\ncomplex proposal would go like this: Suppose an agent is using\nanother. He is using her merely as a means if she has\ndissented to his use of her. This proposal would be free from\nthe implication that the medical personnel treat the patient merely as\na means. Although the patient does not consent to the\ntreatment—he is unconscious and cannot do so—neither does\nhe dissent from it. One possible shortcoming of this new proposal is\nthat it lacks sensitively to the context of the dissent. Suppose\nsomeone has made a contract with a photographer to serve as her model\nfor an hour-long photo-shoot at a park. After fifteen minutes, he\nproclaims that he does not wish to work anymore. If the photographer\nshoots a picture of him leaving the park, does she treat him merely as\na means? The proposed condition implies, perhaps implausibly, that she\ndoes. \nAgainst the background of seemingly implausible implications of\nindividual accounts of conditions for treating others merely as means,\none option is to combine these accounts. For example, we might hold\nroughly that a person is just using another if she is using him, the\nother has now actually given his dissent to it, and he never had the\nopportunity to prevent the use from beginning by withholding his\nagreement to it. Or we might assert roughly that a person treats\nanother merely as a means if she uses him, and the other can neither\nconsent to this use nor share her end in using him. \nKant holds that if someone treats another merely as a means, the\nperson acts wrongly, that is, does something morally impermissible.\nSome accounts of treating others merely as means seem not to yield the\nconclusion that if a person treats another in this way, then he acts\nwrongly. On one “rough definition”, we use another merely\nas a means if we both use the other and regard him  \nas a mere instrument or tool: someone whose well-being and moral\nclaims we ignore, and whom we would treat in whatever ways would best\nachieve our aims. (Parfit 2011: 213 and 227)  \nFor example, a kidnapper treats his victim merely as a means if she\nuses him for profit and thinks of him simply as a tool that she would\ntreat in any way necessary for profit. This account takes quite\nliterally “merely” in “treating others merely as\nmeans”. According to it, treating another merely as a means\namounts roughly to treating the other solely or exclusively as a\ntool. \nIf this is how we understand treating others merely as means, then\ndoing so does not always amount to acting wrongly, it\n appears.[10]\n Suppose that a gangster considers a barista a mere tool to get coffee\nand that he would treat her in whichever way would best serve his\ninterests. In buying coffee from her, the gangster treats her merely\nas a means on this account, but does not, it seems, act wrongly\n(Parfit 2011: 216). \nThis account of treating others merely as means does not seem to\ncoincide with Kant’s notion of doing so. Recall Kant’s\nexample of making a false promise to another for financial gain.\nSuppose that a particular false promiser would not do just\nanything to the other for gain for himself, for example, he would not\nmurder the other’s family. According to Kant’s notion, but\nnot to this account, the false promisor would be treating the other\nmerely as a\n means.[11] \nWe might question whether treating another merely as a means amounts\nto acting wrongly even if we focus on the candidate sufficient\nconditions examined above. For the sake of simplicity, let us focus on\nthe possible consent account\n (§3.2),\n according to which an agent treats another merely as a means if the\nother cannot consent to her use of him. (We could just as effectively\nemploy other proposed sufficient conditions we have discussed for just\nusing another.) Suppose that two muggers attack a victim. The victim\nviolently pushes one of the muggers into the other, so that he (the\nvictim) can make his escape. The victim uses the mugger he pushes, and\nthe mugger presumably is unable to avert this use simply by dissenting\nfrom it. Yet many would object to the idea that the victim is acting\nwrongly. One response to this issue would be to build into accounts of\ntreating another merely as a means the specification that one is not\ndoing that if he is using someone in order to prevent himself or\nsomeone else from being treated in this way. Building in this\nspecification would, of course, tend to make accounts somewhat\nunwieldy. Other examples might render more difficult to accept the\nidea that treating another merely as a means is always morally\nimpermissible. Suppose, for example, that we use one person to save a\nmillion people from nuclear conflagration, without giving the one any\nopportunity to avert the use by dissenting from it. We thereby treat\nthe one merely as a means, according to a possible consent account.\nBut do we act wrongly? Some hold that we do\n not.[12] \nThey might defend the view that while it is always wrong pro\ntanto to treat another merely as a means, doing so is sometimes\nmorally permissible, all things considered. In other words, we always\nhave strong moral reasons not to treat others merely as means, but\nthese reasons can be outweighed by other moral considerations,\npresumably including the good of many lives being preserved. If,\ncontrary to Kant’s view, the moral constraint against treating\nothers merely as means is not absolute, then a question arises as to\nwhen it gets overridden. \nWe have explored sufficient conditions for treating another merely as\na means. But just as challenging as pinpointing them is specifying\nwhen someone uses another, but not merely as a means.\nAccording to one proposal, if an agent uses another, she does\nnot use him merely as a means if he gives his voluntary,\ninformed consent to her use of him. To fix ideas let us say that the\nconsent of the person being used is voluntary only if he is not being\ncoerced into giving it and informed only if he understands how he is\nbeing used and to what purpose(s). This proposal seems intuitively\nattractive. If a person agrees to someone using him and understands\nher ends in doing so, then how can she be treating him merely as a\nmeans? \nAppealing to reflective common sense, philosophers have tried to\nillustrate how. We might refer to one range of cases they invoke as\nexploitation cases because they seem to involve one person\ntaking unfair advantage of another, which is a hallmark of\nexploitation (Wertheimer 1996). To cite one such case, suppose that a\nmother of modest means cannot afford to give her children a good\neducation. A rich person proposes to finance her children’s\nenrollment at excellent schools in exchange for her serving as his\npersonal slave (Davis 1984: 392). The mother might understand the use\nhe intends to put her to and for what purposes. Moreover, if we think\nof coercion as involving an agent threatening to make someone worse\noff than she would be if she did not interact with the agent, then the\nrich person would not count as coercing the mother into agreeing to\nhis use of her. The account of using another but not merely as a means\nthat we are considering might, therefore, imply that the rich person\nis not just using the mother in making her his personal slave. That\nimplication strikes some as implausible. \nAnother type of case that might cause problems for this account\ninvokes unnecessary or otiose threats designed to force another to\nserve one’s purposes. Here is an example of such a case. An\nelderly salesperson thinks that his company is trying to force him\ninto retirement by keeping its latest sales leads from him. Desperate\nto make a sale, he intends to use his office manager to obtain the\nlatest leads. The manager has the password to a database housing the\nleads. He tells her that he really needs to close some deals, and\nunless she gets the latest leads for him, he is going to reveal to\neveryone in the office that she is lesbian. He believes reasonably,\ngiven his incomplete understanding of her and of the attitudes of his\nother co-workers, that this revelation would be damaging to her\nreputation. But the office manager takes the salesperson, whom she\nthinks of as a friendly colleague, to be making an ill-advised joke.\nVirtually everyone in the office is already aware of her sexual\npreference. And, she believes, the salesperson is cognizant that it is\ncompany policy that all salespeople are to be granted access to the\nlatest leads upon request. She gives him a puzzled look and agrees to\nget him the leads right away. \nThe salesperson receives from the office manager her voluntary,\ninformed consent to his use of her to get the leads. She understands\nthat he intends to use her to this end. Granted, he threatens to make\nher worse off if she does not give him the leads. But it is not the\nthreat, which she does not even register as such, that generates her\nagreement to his use of her. She agrees voluntarily. Yet, despite\nobtaining her consent for his use of her, some believe that the\nsalesperson treats the office manager merely as a means and acts (at\nleast pro tanto) wrongly. Others might argue that although\nthe salesperson has revealed a moral deficiency, he has not\ndone anything wrong. Rather, he has simply revealed a morally\nfaulty attitude toward the office manager (Scanlon 2008: 46; Walen\n2014: 428–429). If we judge that the salesperson does act\nwrongly, then we presumably take this case to illustrate that treating\nanother merely as a means does not necessarily amount to harming her.\nIn other words, in treating another merely as a means, an individual\ncan wrong another without harming her. \nRegardless of whether we judge in this case that the salesperson acts\nwrongly, the case helps to illustrate a distinction between\nagent-focused and patient-focused accounts of treating or not treating\nanother merely as a means. According to the account we are\nconsidering, let us recall, if an agent uses another, she does\nnot use him merely as a means if he gives his voluntary,\ninformed consent to her use of him. This account focuses on the other,\nthat is, on the individual treated as a means to determine whether the\nagent is treating him merely as a means. If he (i.e., the\nother) gives his informed, voluntary consent to being used in some\nway, then the agent does not treat him merely as a means, according to\nthe account. To make this determination, an agent-focused account\nwould, of course, focus more on the agent. Such an account might hold,\nfor example, that if an agent uses another, she does not use him\nmerely as a means if it is reasonable for her (the agent) to\nbelieve that the other gives his voluntary, informed consent to\nher use of him. According to the notion of reasonable belief invoked\nhere, it is reasonable for someone to believe something roughly if the\nbelief is justifiable given the person’s context (e.g., his\nupbringing, cognitive limitations, and so forth). Contrary to the\npatient-focused account, the agent-focused account is free from the\nimplication that the salesperson is not treating the office manager\nmerely as a means. It is not reasonable for the salesperson\nto believe that the office manager has given her voluntary consent to\nhis use of her. It is, rather, reasonable for him to believe that he\nhas coerced her into giving him the sales leads. A parallel\npatient-based vs. agent-based distinction applies, of course, to\naccounts of sufficient conditions for treating another merely as a\nmeans. One might, for example, hold that an agent just uses another if\nthe other cannot share the end the agent is pursuing in using him (a\npatient-focused account). Or one might hold that an agent just uses\nanother if it is reasonable for her to believe that the other cannot\nshare the end the agent is pursuing in using him (an agent-focused\naccount). \nWe have been considering actual consent accounts of agents using\nothers, but not treating them merely as means. We can also develop\naccounts that invoke other concepts familiar from discussion of\nsufficient conditions for treating others merely as means, including\nthe concepts of possible end-sharing and possible consent. For\nexample, we might suggest that an agent who uses another does not use\nthat other merely as a means if the other can consent to the\nagent’s use of him, that is, if the other can avert the use\nsimply by dissenting from it. This suggestion, as well as others that\ninvoke additional concepts we have considered, such as that of end\nsharing, might generate questionable verdicts regarding exploitation\ncases. For example, the mother of modest means discussed above can\nconsent to the rich person’s use of her. Her dissent from it\nalone would stop it from occurring. But some would insist that the\nrich person is nevertheless treating her merely as a means in making\nher his personal slave in exchange for educating his children. \nAnother approach to conditions under which an agent uses another, but\ndoes not treat him merely as a means takes shape against a literal\nconstrual of treating others merely as means. On this construal,\ndiscussed above, we use another merely as a means roughly if we both\nuse the other and regard him as a mere tool. According to the\napproach, we do not treat another merely as a means if our\ntreatment of the other person “is governed or guided in\nsufficiently important ways by some relevant moral belief or\nconcern” (Parfit 2011: 214). But when is an agent’s use of\nanother governed in sufficiently important ways by some relevant moral\nbelief or concern? The agent’s use of another is so governed,\naccording to one response, when the agent tries to and succeeds in\nusing the other only in ways to which the other can rationally\nconsent. \nBut when can the other rationally consent? To simplify matters, let us\nmake some background assumptions. Let us suppose that the people who\nmight be used understand what will be done to them and to what\npurpose, as well as the effects the use will have. Let us also assume\nthat those who might be used have the power to give (or to withhold)\nconsent in the “act-affecting sense” (Parfit 2011:\n183–184). When we ask whether they can rationally consent to\nbeing used, we are asking whether it would be rational for them to\nconsent (or dissent) supposing that their choice would determine\nwhether or not they were used. \nAgainst the background of these assumptions, we can say that, on this\naccount, a person can rationally consent to being treated as a means\njust in case he has sufficient reasons to consent to it. The\naccount rests on an “objective” view of reasons, according\nto which  \nthere are certain facts that give us reasons both to have certain\ndesires and aims, and to do whatever might achieve these aims. These\nreasons are given by facts about the objects of these desires\nor aims, or what we might want or try to achieve. (Parfit 2011: 45)\n \nFor example, the fact that a child is in pain as a result of a\nsplinter stuck in his finger gives me reason to want to and to try to\nget it\n out.[13]\n On this account, we have impartial as well as partial reasons for\nagreeing to be treated in various ways. Our impartial reasons are\n“person-neutral” (2011: 138). We do not need to invoke\nourselves when we describe the facts that yield these reasons. The\nfact that some event would cause tremendous pain to a particular\nperson, for example, gives us reason (albeit perhaps not sufficient\nreason) to prevent the event or relieve the pain “whoever this\nperson may be, and whatever this person’s relation to us”\n(2011: 138). Our partial reasons are “person-relative”:\nthey “are provided by facts whose description must refer to\nus” (2011: 138). The fact that the little boy being hurt by the\nsplinter is my son gives me a partial reason to pull it out.\nWe each have partial reasons to be particularly attentive to our own\nwell-being and to the well-being of those in our circle, for example,\nour family and friends. According to the account,  \nWhen one of our two possible acts would make things go in some way\nthat would be impartially better, but the other act would make things\ngo better either for ourselves or for those to whom we have close\nties, we often have sufficient reasons to act in either of these ways.\n(2011: 137)  \nFor example, regarding a case in which a person could either save\nhimself from some injury or do something that would save some\nstranger’s life in a distant land, the person presumably has\nsufficient reasons to do either one. In a similar vein, a person can\nhave sufficient reason to consent to being treated as a means by\nvirtue of some impartial reason, such as the fact that his being so\ntreated will save many lives, even if he also has sufficient reason to\ndissent from being treated as a means by virtue of some partial\nreason, such as the fact that his being so treated will result in\nsuffering for him. In sum, this account holds that if an agent uses\nanother, he does not use the other merely as a means if the other has\nsufficient reasons, as just characterized, for agreeing to be\nused. \nThe account seems to imply that cases thought to be paradigmatic of\ntreating others merely as means do not involve treating them in this\nway. Take a case in which a pedestrian is on a bridge above a track\nwhere a train is barreling toward five people (Parfit 2011: 218). The\nonly way to save the five would be to open, by remote control, a\ntrap-door on which the pedestrian is standing, so that he would fall\nin front of the train. The train would kill him, but the impact would\ntrigger its automatic brake. If a bystander opens the trap door, then\nshe uses the pedestrian as a means to save the five. The pedestrian\nhas sufficient reasons to refrain from consenting to being used to\nstop the train. After all, it will result in his premature death. But,\naccording to the account, he also might have sufficient reasons to\nconsent to being used to stop the train; for his being used in this\nway would save the lives of five people, contributing to an outcome\nwhich is presumably impartially best (2011: 220). Suppose the\nbystander opens the trap door and uses the person on the bridge to\nsave the five. In so doing, she might be limiting her use of another\nto ways to which the other can rationally consent. If she is, then she\nis not treating the person merely as a means, according to the\naccount. \nConsider another well-known example. Five patients at a hospital are\nin immediate need of different organs. One patient needs a kidney,\nanother needs a liver, and so forth. If a surgeon used a healthy\nperson undergoing routine tests as a resource for organs, killing him\nin the process, all of the five would be saved (Harman 1977:\n3–4). The healthy person presumably has strong partial reasons\nto dissent from being used for his organs. But he also arguably has\nenough impartial reason to consent, namely, that five people will\nthereby be saved, such that overall he has sufficient reason to\nconsent. So, assuming that the surgeon is trying to treat people only\nin ways to which they can rationally consent, she might not be\ntreating the healthy person merely as a means, even if before she\nsucceeds in putting him under, he is begging for his\n life.[14]\n If the account we are considering of using others, but not merely as\nmeans does entail that the bystander and the doctor in these two cases\nare not treating others merely as means, the account suffers from a\nsignificant flaw, according to some. \nIn the words of one philosopher, the idea that it is wrong to treat\nothers merely as means is “both very important and very hard to\npin down” (Glover 2006: 65). Our investigation has illustrated\nchallenges in specifying what it means to treat others merely as\nmeans. It has not revealed one, univocal concept, grounded in common\nsense, of what just using another amounts to. In the end, there may be\nno such concept, but rather a set of overlapping notions, which point\nto a range of morally problematic actions or attitudes concerning the\nuse of others.
