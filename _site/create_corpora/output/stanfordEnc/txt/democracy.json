It is distinct from descriptive\nand explanatory democratic theory. It does not offer in the first\ninstance a scientific study of those societies that are called\ndemocratic. It aims to provide an account of when and why democracy is\nmorally desirable as well as moral principles for guiding the design of\ndemocratic institutions. Of course, normative democratic theory is\ninherently interdisciplinary and must call on the results of political\nscience, sociology and economics in order to give this kind of concrete\nguidance.\n\n\n\nThis brief outline of normative democratic theory focuses attention\non four distinct issues in recent work. First, it outlines some\ndifferent approaches to the question of why democracy is morally\ndesirable at all. Second, it explores the question of what it is\nreasonable to expect from citizens in large democratic societies. \nThis issue is central to the evaluation of normative democratic\ntheories as we will see. A large body of opinion has it that most\nclassical normative democratic theory is incompatible with what we can\nreasonably expect from citizens. It also discusses blueprints of\ndemocratic institutions for dealing with issues that arise from a\nconception of citizenship. Third, it surveys different accounts of the\nproper characterization of equality in the processes of representation.\nThese last two parts display the interdisciplinary nature of normative\ndemocratic theory. Fourth, it discusses the issue of whether and when\ndemocratic institutions have authority and it discusses different\nconceptions of the limits of democratic authority.\n\n\n\nTo fix ideas, the term “democracy,” as I will use it in\nthis article, refers very generally to a method of group decision\nmaking characterized by a kind of equality among the participants at\nan essential stage of the collective decision making.   Four\naspects of this definition should be noted. First, democracy concerns\ncollective decision making, by which I mean decisions that are made\nfor groups and that are binding on all the members of the\ngroup. Second, this definition means to cover a lot of different kinds\nof groups that may be called democratic. So there can be democracy in\nfamilies, voluntary organizations, economic firms, as well as states\nand transnational and global organizations. Third, the definition is\nnot intended to carry any normative weight to it. It is quite\ncompatible with this definition of democracy that it is not desirable\nto have democracy in some particular context. So the definition of\ndemocracy does not settle any normative questions. Fourth, the\nequality required by the definition of democracy may be more or less\ndeep. It may be the mere formal equality of one-person one-vote in an\nelection for representatives to an assembly where there is competition\namong candidates for the position. Or it may be more robust, including\nequality in the processes of deliberation and coalition building.\n“Democracy” may refer to any of these political\narrangements. It may involve direct participation of the members of a\nsociety in deciding on the laws and policies of the society or it may\ninvolve the participation of those members in selecting\nrepresentatives to make the decisions. \n\nThe function of normative democratic theory is not to settle questions\nof definition but to determine which, if any, of the forms democracy\nmay take are morally desirable and when and how.   For\ninstance, Joseph Schumpeter argues (1956, chap. XXI), with some force,\nthat only a highly formal kind of democracy in which citizens vote in\nan electoral process for the purpose of selecting competing elites is\nhighly desirable while a conception of democracy that draws on a more\nambitious conception of equality is dangerous. On the other hand,\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1762, Book II, chap. 1) is apt to argue that\nthe formal variety of democracy is akin to slavery while only robustly\negalitarian democracies have political legitimacy. Others have argued\nthat democracy is not desirable at all. To evaluate their arguments we\nmust decide on the merits of the different principles and conceptions\nof humanity and society from which they proceed. \n\nWe can evaluate democracy along at least two different dimensions:\nconsequentially, by reference to the outcomes of using it compared with\nother methods of political decision making; or intrinsically, by\nreference to qualities that are inherent in the method, for example,\nwhether there is something inherently fair about making democratic\ndecisions on matters on which people disagree. \n\nTwo kinds of in instrumental benefits are commonly attributed to\ndemocracy: relatively good laws and policies and improvements in the\ncharacters of the participants. John Stuart Mill argued that a\ndemocratic method of making legislation is better than non-democratic\nmethods in three ways: strategically, epistemically and via the\nimprovement of the characters of democratic citizens (Mill, 1861,\nChapter 3). Strategically, democracy has an advantage because it forces\ndecision-makers to take into account the interests, rights and\nopinions of most people in society. Since democracy gives some\npolitical power to each, more people are taken into account than under\naristocracy or monarchy. The most forceful contemporary statement of\nthis instrumental argument is provided by Amartya Sen, who argues, for\nexample, that “no substantial famine has ever occurred in any\nindependent country with a democratic form of government and a\nrelatively free press” (Sen 1999, 152). The basis of this\nargument is that politicians in a multiparty democracy with free\nelections and a free press have incentives to respond to the\nexpressions of needs of the poor. \n\nEpistemologically, democracy is thought to be the best decision-making\nmethod on the grounds that it is generally more reliable in helping\nparticipants discover the right decisions. Since democracy brings a\nlot of people into the process of decision making, it can take\nadvantage of many sources of information and critical assessment of\nlaws and policies. Democratic decision-making tends to be more\ninformed than other forms about the interests of citizens and the\ncausal mechanisms necessary to advance those interests. Furthermore,\nthe broad based discussion typical of democracy enhances the critical\nassessment of the different moral ideas that guide\ndecision-makers. \n Many have endorsed democracy on the basis of the proposition that\ndemocracy has beneficial effects on character. Many have noted with\nMill and Rousseau that democracy tends to make people stand up for\nthemselves more than other forms of rule do because it makes\ncollective decisions depend on them more than monarchy or aristocracy\ndo. Hence, in democratic societies individuals are encouraged to be\nmore autonomous. In addition, democracy tends to get people to think\ncarefully and rationally more than other forms of rule because it\nmakes a difference whether they do or not. Finally, some have argued\nthat democracy tends to enhance the moral qualities of citizens. When\nthey participate in making decisions, they have to listen to others,\nthey are called upon to justify themselves to others and they are\nforced to think in part in terms of the interests of others. Some have\nargued that when people find themselves in this kind of circumstance,\nthey come genuinely to think in terms of the common good and justice.\nHence, some have argued that democratic processes tend to enhance the\nautonomy, rationality and morality of participants. Since these\nbeneficial effects are thought to be worthwhile in themselves, they\ncount in favor of democracy and against other forms of rule (Mill\n1861, p. 74, Elster 2002, p. 152). \n\nSome argue in addition that the above effects on character tend to\nenhance the quality of legislation as well. A society of autonomous,\nrational, and moral decision-makers is more likely to produce good\nlegislation than a society ruled by a self-centered person or small\ngroup of persons who rule over slavish and unreflective subjects. \n More detailed knowledge of the effects of political institutions can\nbe used to discriminate in favor of particular kinds of democratic\ninstitutions or modifications of them. For instance in the United\nStates, James Madison argued in favor of a fairly strong federal\ngovernment on the grounds that local governments are more likely to be\noppressive to minorities (Madison, Hamilton and Jay 1788, n. 10). Of\ncourse the soundness of any of the above arguments depends on the\ntruth or validity of the associated substantive views about justice\nand the common good as well as the causal theories of the consequences\nof different institutions. \n\nNot all instrumental arguments favor democracy. Plato\n(Republic, Book VI) argues that democracy is inferior to\nvarious forms of monarchy, aristocracy and even oligarchy on the\ngrounds that democracy tends to undermine the expertise necessary to\nproperly governed societies. In a democracy, he argues, those who are\nexpert at winning elections and nothing else will eventually dominate\ndemocratic politics. Democracy tends to emphasize this expertise at\nthe expense of the expertise that is necessary to properly governed\nsocieties. The reason for this is that most people do not have the\nkinds of talents that enable them to think well about the difficult\nissues that politics involves. But in order to win office or get a\npiece of legislation passed, politicians must appeal to these people's\nsense of what is right or not right. Hence, the state will be guided\nby very poorly worked out ideas that experts in manipulation and mass\nappeal use to help themselves win office. \n\nHobbes (1651, chap. XIX) argues that democracy is inferior to monarchy\nbecause democracy fosters destabilizing dissension among subjects. But\nhis skepticism is not based in a conception that most people are not\nintellectually fit for politics. On his view, individual citizens and\neven politicians are apt not to have a sense of responsibility for the\nquality of legislation because no one makes a significant difference\nto the outcomes of decision making. As a consequence, citizens’\nconcerns are not focused on politics and politicians succeed only by\nmaking loud and manipulative appeals to citizens in order to gain more\npower, but all lack incentives to consider views that are genuinely\nfor the common good. Hence the sense of lack of responsibility for\noutcomes undermines politicians’ concern for the common good and\ninclines them to make sectarian and divisive appeals to citizens. For\nHobbes, then, democracy has deleterious effects on subjects and\npoliticians and consequently on the quality of the outcomes of\ncollective decision making. \n\nMany public choice theorists in contemporary economic thought expand\non these Hobbesian criticisms. They argue that citizens are not\ninformed about politics and that they are often apathetic, which makes\nroom for special interests to control the behavior of politicians and\nuse the state for their own limited purposes all the while spreading\nthe costs to everyone else. Some of them argue for giving over near\ncomplete control over society to the market, on the grounds that more\nextensive democracy tends to produce serious economic inefficiencies.\nMore modest versions of these arguments have been used to justify\nmodification of democratic institutions. \n\nInstrumentalists argue that these instrumental arguments for and\nagainst the democratic process are the only bases on which to evaluate\ndemocracy or compare it with other forms of political decision making.\nThere are a number of different kinds of argument for instrumentalism.\nOne kind of argument proceeds from a certain kind of moral\ntheory.   For example classical utilitarianism simply has no\nroom in its fundamental value theory for the ideas of intrinsic\nfairness, liberty or the intrinsic importance of an egalitarian\ndistribution of political power. Its sole concern with maximizing\nutility understood as pleasure or desire satisfaction guarantees that\nit can provide only instrumental arguments for and against\ndemocracy.   And there are many moral theories of this\nsort. \n But one need not be a thoroughgoing consequentialist to argue for\ninstrumentalism in democratic theory. There are arguments in favor of\ninstrumentalism that pertain directly to the question of democracy and\ncollective decision making generally. One argument states that\npolitical power involves the exercise of power of some over\nothers. And it argues that the exercise of power of one person over\nanother can only be justified by reference to the protection of the\ninterests or rights of the person over whom power is exercised. Thus\nno distribution of political power could ever be justified except by\nreference to the quality of outcomes of the decision making process\n(Arneson 2002, pp. 96-97). \n Other arguments question the coherence of the idea of intrinsically\nfair collective decision making processes. For instance, social choice\ntheory questions the idea that there can be a fair decision making\nfunction that transforms a set of individual preferences into a\nrational collective preference. No general rule satisfying reasonable\nconstraints can be devised that can transform any set of individual\npreferences into a rational social preference. And this is taken to\nshow that democratic procedures cannot be intrinsically fair (Riker\n1980, p. 116). Dworkin argues that the idea of equality, which is for\nhim at the root of social justice, cannot be given a coherent and\nplausible interpretation when it comes to the distribution of\npolitical power among members of the society. The relation of\npoliticians to citizens inevitably gives rise to inequality, so it\ncannot be intrinsically fair or just (Dworkin 2000, ch. 4 [originally\npublished in 1987]). In later work, Dworkin has pulled back from this\noriginally thoroughgoing instrumentalism (Dworkin 2000, ch. 10\n[originally published in 1999]). \n\nFew theorists deny that political institutions must be at least in\npart evaluated in terms of the outcomes of having those institutions.\nSome argue in addition, that some forms of decision making are morally\ndesirable independent of the consequences of having them. A variety of\ndifferent approaches have been used to show that democracy has this\nkind of intrinsic value. The most common of these come broadly under\nthe rubrics of liberty and equality. \n\nSome argue that the basic principles of democracy are founded in the\nidea that each individual has a right to liberty. Democracy, it is\nsaid, extends the idea that each ought to be master of his or her life\nto the domain of collective decision making. First, each person's life\nis deeply affected by the larger social, legal and cultural\nenvironment in which he or she lives. Second, only when each person\nhas an equal voice and vote in the process of collective\ndecision-making will each have control over this larger environment.\nThinkers such as Carol Gould (1988, pp.45-85) conclude that only when\nsome kind of democracy is implemented, will individuals have a chance\nat self-government. Since individuals have a right of self-government,\nthey have a right to democratic participation. This right is\nestablished at least partly independently of the worth of the outcomes\nof democratic decision making. The idea is that the right of\nself-government gives one a right, within limits, to do wrong. Just as\nan individual has a right to make some bad decisions for himself or\nherself, so a group of individuals have a right to make bad or unjust\ndecisions for themselves regarding those activities they share. \n\nHere we can see the makings of an argument against instrumentalism.\nTo the extent that an instrumentalist wishes to diminish a\nperson's power to contribute to the democratic process for the\nsake of enhancing the quality of decisions, he is committed to thinking\nthat there is no moral loss in the fact that our power has been\ndiminished. But if the liberty argument is correct our right to control\nour lives is violated by this. \n One major difficulty with this line of argument is that it appears to\nrequire that the basic rule of decision making be consensus or\nunanimity. If each person must freely choose the outcomes that bind him\nor her then those who oppose the decision are not self-governing. They\nlive in an environment imposed on them by others. So only when all\nagree to a decision are they freely adopting the decision. \n\nThe trouble is that there is rarely agreement on major issues in\npolitics. Indeed, it appears that one of the main reasons for having\npolitical decision making procedures is that they can settle matters\ndespite disagreement. And so it is hard to see how any political\ndecision making method can respect everyone's liberty. \n\nOne distant relative of the self-government approach is the account of\ndemocracy as a process of public justification defended by, among\nothers, Joshua Cohen (2002, p. 21). The idea behind this approach is\nthat laws and policies are legitimate to the extent that they are\npublicly justified to the citizens of the community. Public\njustification is justification to each citizen as a result of free and\nreasoned debate among equals.  Citizens justify laws and policies to\neach other on the basis of mutually acceptable reasons. Democracy,\nproperly understood, is the context in which individuals freely engage\nin a process of reasoned discussion and deliberation on an equal\nfooting. The ideas of freedom and equality provide guidelines for\nstructuring democratic institutions. \n The aim of democracy as public justification is reasoned consensus\namong citizens. But a serious problem arises when we ask about what\nhappens when disagreement remains. Two possible replies have been\nsuggested to this kind of worry. It has been urged that forms of\nconsensus weaker than full consensus are sufficient for public\njustification and that the weaker varieties are achievable in many\nsocieties. For instance, there may be consensus on the list of reasons\nthat are acceptable publicly but disagreement on the weight of the\ndifferent reasons. Or there may be agreement on general reasons\nabstractly understood but disagreement about particular\ninterpretations of those reasons. What would have to be shown here is\nthat such weak consensus is achievable in many societies and that the\ndisagreements that remain are not incompatible with the ideal of\npublic justification. \n Another set of worries concerning this approach arises when we ask what\nreason there is for trying to ensure that political decisions are\ngrounded in principles that everyone can reasonably accept. What is the\nbasis of this need for consensus? To be sure, the consensus that is\naimed at is reasonable consensus among reasonable persons. Reasonable\nconsensus does not imply actual consensus. The unreasonable persons in\nsociety need not agree with the terms of association arrived at by\nreasonable persons in order for those terms to be legitimate. \n\nThe basic principle seems to be the principle of reasonableness\naccording to which reasonable persons will only offer principles for\nthe regulation of their society that other reasonable persons can\nreasonably accept. The notion of the reasonable is meant to be fairly\nweak on this account. One can reasonably reject a doctrine to the\nextent that it is incompatible with one's own doctrine as long as\none's doctrine does not imply imposition on others and it is a\ndoctrine that has survived sustained critical reflection. So this\nprinciple is a kind of principle of reciprocity. One only offers\nprinciples that others, who restrain themselves in the same way, can\naccept. Such a principle implies a kind of principle of restraint\nwhich requires that reasonable persons not propose laws and policies\non the basis of controversial principles for the regulation of\nsociety. When individuals offer proposals for the regulation of their\nsociety, they ought not to appeal to the whole truth as they see it\nbut only to that part of the whole truth that others can reasonably\naccept. To put the matter in the way Rawls puts it: political society\nmust be regulated by principles on which there is an overlapping\nconsensus (Rawls, 1996, Lecture IV). This is meant to obviate the need\nfor a complete consensus on the principles that regulate society. \n\nWhat moral reasons can there be for restraining oneself from\noffering what one takes to be the best justified proposals for the\nterms of the society one lives in? One might consider a number of\narguments for this principle of reasonableness. One argument is an\nepistemological one. It is that there is no justification independent\nof what people or at least reasonable people believe. Hence, if one\ncannot provide a justification for principles that others can accept\ngiven their reasonable beliefs then those principles are not justified\nfor those persons. Another argument is a moral argument. One fails to\nrespect the reason of the other members of society if one imposes terms\nof association on them that they cannot accept given their reasonable\nviews. This failure of respect for the reason of the other members of\nsociety defeats the value of the principles one is proposing for the\nsociety. A third argument is a specifically democratic argument. One\ndoes not genuinely treat others as equals if one insists on imposing\nprinciples on them that they cannot reasonably accept, even if this\nimposition takes place against the background of egalitarian decision\nmaking processes. \n\nEach of these three arguments can be questioned. On the democratic\nargument, it simply isn’t clear why it is necessary to\ndemocratic equality to justify ones views on terms that others can\naccept. If each person has robust rights to participate in debate and\ndecision making and each person's views are given a reasonable\nhearing, it is not clear why equality requires more. My rejection of\nanother person's beliefs does not in any way imply that I think that\nperson is inferior to me in capacity or in moral worth or in the\nrights to have a say in society. The epistemological argument seems to\npresuppose a far too restrictive conception of justification to be\nplausible. Many beliefs are justified for me even if they are not\ncompatible with the political beliefs I currently hold as long as\nthose beliefs can be vindicated by the use of procedures and methods\nof thinking that I use to evaluate beliefs. The conception of respect\nfor reason in the moral argument seems not obviously to favor the\nprinciple of reasonableness. It may require that I do as much as I can\nto make sure that the society I live in conform to what I take to be\nrationally defensible norms. Of course, I may also believe that such a\nsociety must be democratically organized in which case I will attempt\nto advance these principles through the democratic process. \n\nMoreover, it is hard to see how this approach avoids the need for a\ncomplete consensus, which is highly unlikely to occur in any even\nmoderately diverse society. The reason for this is that it is not clear\nwhy it is any less of an imposition on me when I propose legislation or\npolicies for the society that I must restrain myself to considerations\nthat other reasonable people accept than it is an imposition on others\nwhen I attempt to pass legislation on the basis of reasons they\nreasonably reject. For if I do restrain myself in this way, then the\nsociety I live in will not live up to the standards that I believe are\nessential to evaluating the society. I must then live in and support a\nsociety that does not accord with my conception of how it ought to be\norganized. It is not clear why this is any less of a loss of control\nover society than for those who must live in a society that is partly\nregulated by principles they do not accept. \n\nMany democratic theorists have argued that democracy is a way of\ntreating persons as equals when there is good reason to impose some\nkind of organization on their shared lives but they disagree about how\nbest to do it. On one version, defended by Peter Singer (1973,\npp. 30-41), when people insist on different ways of arranging matters\nproperly, each person in a sense claims a right to be dictator over\ntheir shared lives. But these claims to dictatorship cannot all hold\nup, the argument goes.  Democracy embodies a kind of peaceful and fair\ncompromise among these conflicting claims to rule. Each compromises\nequally on what he claims as long as the others do, resulting in each\nhaving an equal say over decision making. In effect, democratic\ndecision making respects each person's point of view on matters of\ncommon concern by giving each an equal say about what to do in cases\nof disagreement (Singer 1973, Waldron 1999, chap. 5). \n\nOne difficulty is that this view relies on agreement much as the\nliberty views described above. What if people disagree on the\ndemocratic method or on the particular form democracy is to take? Are\nwe to decide these latter questions by means of a higher order\nprocedure? And if there is disagreement on the higher order procedure,\nmust we also democratically decide that question? The view seems to\nlead to an infinite regress. \n Another egalitarian defense of democracy asserts that it publicly\nembodies the equal advancement of the interests of the citizens of a\nsociety when there is disagreement about how best to organize their\nshared life. The idea is that a society ought to be structured to\nadvance equally the interests of the members of the society. And the\nequality of members ought to be advanced in a way that each can see\nthat they are being treated as equals. So it requires equal advancement\nof interests in accordance with a public measure of those\ninterests. Hence, justice requires the publicly equal advancement\nof the interests of the members of society or public equality. \n The idea of public equality requires some explanation. If we\nstart with the principle of equal advancement of interests, we will\nwant to know what it implies. Does it imply equality of well\nbeing or equality of opportunity for well being or equality of\nresources?  There are other possibilities but the problem with\nthese accounts is that they cannot be realized in a way that every\nconscientious and informed person can know them to be in place. \nSo even if one of these principles is implemented many will think that\nthey are not being treated equally. There are likely to be too many\ndisagreements about what each person's well being consists in and\nhow to compare it to the well being of others. The question for a\npolitical society is, is there a kind of equality that genuinely\nadvances equally the interests of the members of the society but that\ndoes so in a way that all conscientious and informed people can agree\ntreats them as equals?  And the answer to this question must be\ninformed by background facts of diversity, cognitive bias, fallibility\nand disagreement. Public equality is the realization of equality\nof advancement of interests that all can see to be such a\nrealization. And the basic argument for democracy is that it\nrealizes equality of advancement of interests when we take the\nbackground facts above into account.  \n Now the idea is that public equality is a great value. The\nimportance of publicity itself is grounded in equality. Given the\nfacts of diversity, cognitive bias, fallibility and disagreement, each\nwill have reason to think that if they are ruled in accordance with\nsome specific notion of equality advanced by some particular group that\ntheir interests are likely to be set back in some way. Only a\nconception of equality that can be shared by the members of society can\ngive good reason to think that this will not happen. Within the\ncontext set by public equality, people can argue for more specific\nimplementations of equality among citizens in law and policy all the\nwhile knowing that there will be substantial and conscientious\ndisagreement on them. As long as the framework within which they\nmake and vote for opposing views is set by public equality, they can\nknow that at base, the society treats them as equals in a way that they\ncan recognize. \n\nThe publicly equal advancement of interests requires that\nindividuals’ judgments be taken into account equally when there\nis disagreement. Here is the argument for the transition from equal\nconcern for interests to equal concern for judgment. Respect for each\ncitizen's judgment is grounded in the principle of public equality\ncombined with a number of basic facts and fundamental interests that\nattend social life in typical societies. The basic facts are that\nindividuals are very diverse in terms of their interests.  People's\ninterests are diverse because of their different natural talents,\nbecause they are raised in different sectors of society and because\nthey are raised in societies where there is a diversity of cultural\nbackgrounds. Partly as a consequence of the fact that people are\nraised in different sectors of society and in distinct cultural\nmilieus they are likely to have deep cognitive biases when they\nattempt to understand other people's interests and how they are\ncompared to their own interests. Those biases will tend to assimilate\nother people's interests to their own in some circumstances or\ndownplay them when there is a wide divergence of interests. Hence\npeople have deep cognitive biases towards their own interests. The\nfacts of diversity and of cognitive bias ensure that individuals are\nhighly fallible in their understanding of their own and others’\ninterests and that there will be considerable disagreement among them.\nAnd they are likely to be highly fallible in their efforts to compare\nthe importance of other people's interests to their own. So they are\nhighly fallible in their efforts to realize equal advancement of\ninterests in society. And of course there will be a lot of substantial\ndisagreement about how best to advance each person's interests\nequally. \n\nAgainst the background of these facts each person has interests that\nstand out as especially important in a pluralistic society. They have\ninterests in correcting for the cognitive biases of others when it\ncomes to the creation or revision of common economic, legal and\npolitical institutions. And each person has interests in living in a\nworld that makes some sense to them, that accords, within limits, to\ntheir sense of how that social world out to be structured. The facts\ndescribed above, and the principle of equality, suggest that each\nperson ought to have an equal say in determining the common legal,\neconomic and political institutions they live under. In the light of\nthese interests each citizen would have good reason to think that his\nor her interests were not being given the same weight as others if he\nor she had less decision making power than the others. And so each\nperson who is deprived of a right to an equal say would have reason to\nbelieve that she is being treated publicly as an\ninferior. Furthermore, since each person has an interest in being\nrecognized as an equal member of the community, and having less than\nan equal say suggests that they are being treated as inferiors, only\nequality in decision making power is compatible with the public equal\nadvancement of interests. The principle of equal advancement of\ninterests also implies limits to what can be up for democratic control\nand so the infinite regress noted above is avoided. \n\nSo against the background facts of diversity, cognitive bias,\nfallibility and disagreement each person has fundamental interests in\nhaving an equal say in the processes of collective decision making. And\nso in order for people to be treated publicly as equals they must have\nan equal say in collective decision making (Christiano, 2004). \n\nA number of worries attend this kind of view. First, it is generally\nthought that majority rule is required for treating persons as equals\nin collective decision making. This is because only majority rule is\nneutral towards alternatives in decision making. Unanimity tends to\nfavor the status quo as do various forms of supermajority rule. But if\nthis is so, the above view raises the twin dangers of majority tyranny\nand of persistent minorities i.e. groups of persons who find\nthemselves always losing in majority decisions. Surely these latter\nphenomena must be incompatible with equality and even with public\nequality. Second, the kind of view defended above is susceptible to\nthe criticisms leveled against the ideal of equality in decision\nmaking processes. Is it a coherent ideal, in particular in the modern\nstate?  This last worry will be discussed in more detail in the next\nsections on democratic citizenship and legislative representation. The\nfirst worry will be discussed more in the discussion on the limits to\ndemocratic authority. \n\nA vexing problem of democratic theory has been to determine whether\nordinary citizens are up to the task of governing a large society.\nThere are three distinct problems here. First, Plato\n(Republic, Book VI) argued that some people are more\nintelligent and more moral than others and that those persons ought to\nrule. Second, others have argued that a society must have a division\nof labor. If everyone were engaged in the complex and difficult task\nof politics, little time or energy would be left for the other\nessential tasks of a society. Conversely, if we expect most people to\nengage in other difficult and complex tasks, how can we expect them to\nhave the time and resources sufficient to devote themselves\nintelligently to politics? \n Third, since individuals have so little impact on the outcomes of\npolitical decision making in large societies, they have little sense\nof responsibility for the outcomes. Some have argued that it is not\nrational to vote since the chances that a vote will affect the outcome\nof an election are nearly indistinguishable from zero. Worse still,\nAnthony Downs has argued (1957, chap. 13) that almost all of those who\ndo vote have little reason to become informed about how best to\nvote. On the assumption that citizens reason and behave roughly\naccording to the Downsian model, either the society must in fact be\nrun by a relatively small group of people with minimal input from the\nrest or it will be very poorly run. As we can see these criticisms are\nechoes of the sorts of criticisms Plato and Hobbes made. \n\nThese observations pose challenges for any robustly egalitarian or\ndeliberative conception of democracy. Without the ability to\nparticipate intelligently in politics one cannot use one's votes to\nadvance one's aims nor can one be said to participate in a process of\nreasoned deliberation among equals. So, either equality of political\npower implies a kind of self-defeating equal participation of citizens\nin politics or a reasonable division of labor seems to undermine\nequality of power. And either substantial participation of citizens in\npublic deliberation entails the relative neglect of other tasks or the\nproper functioning of the other sectors of the society requires that\nmost people do not participate intelligently in public\ndeliberation. \n\nSome modern theorists of democracy, called elite theorists, have\nargued against any robustly egalitarian or deliberative forms of\ndemocracy on these grounds. They argue that high levels of citizen\nparticipation tend to produce bad legislation designed by demagogues\nto appeal to poorly informed and overly emotional citizens. They look\nupon the alleged uninformedness of citizens evidenced in many\nempirical studies in the 1950s and 1960s as perfectly reasonable and\npredictable. Indeed they regard the alleged apathy of citizens in\nmodern states as highly desirable social phenomena. The alternative,\nthey believe, is a highly motivated population of persons who know\nnothing and who are more likely than not to pursue irrational and\nemotionally appealing aims. \n\nJoseph Schumpeter's assertion that the “democratic method is\nthat institutional arrangement for arriving at political decisions in\nwhich individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a\ncompetitive struggle for the people's vote” (1956, p. 269),\nstill stands as a concise statement of the elitist view. In this view,\nthe emphasis is placed on responsible political leadership.  Political\nleaders are to avoid divisive and emotionally charged issues and make\npolicy and law with little regard for the fickle and diffuse demands\nmade by ordinary citizens. Citizens participate in the process of\ncompetition by voting but since they know very little they are not\neffectively the ruling part of the society. The process of election is\nusually just a fairly peaceful way of maintaining or changing those\nwho rule. \n\nOn Schumpeter's view, however, citizens do have a role to play in\navoiding serious disasters. When politicians act in ways that nearly\nanyone can see is problematic, the citizens can throw the bums out. So\ndemocracy, even on this stripped down version, plays some role in\nprotecting society from the worst politicians. \n\nSo the elite theory of democracy does seem compatible with some of the\ninstrumentalist arguments given above but it is strongly opposed to\nthe intrinsic arguments from liberty, public justification and\nequality. Against the liberty and equality arguments, the elite theory\nsimply rejects the possibility that citizens can participate as\nequals.  The society must be ruled by elites and the role of citizens\nis merely to ensure smooth and peaceful circulation of elites. Against\nthe public justification view, ordinary citizens cannot be expected to\nparticipate in public deliberation and the views of elites ought not\nto be fundamentally transformed by general public deliberation. To be\nsure, it is conceivable for all that has been said that there can be\nan elite deliberative democracy wherein elites deliberate, perhaps\neven out of sight of the population at large, on how to run the\nsociety. Indeed, some deliberative democrats do emphasize deliberation\nin legislative assemblies though in general deliberative democrats\nfavor a more broadly egalitarian approach to deliberation, which is\nvulnerable to the kinds of worries raised by Schumpeter and Downs. \n\nOne approach that is in part motivated by the problem of democratic\ncitizenship but which attempts to preserve some elements of equality\nagainst the elitist criticism is the interest group pluralist account\nof politics. Robert Dahl's early statement of the view is very\npowerful. “In a rough sense, the essence of all competitive\npolitics is bribery of the electorate by politicians… The\nfarmer… supports a candidate committed to high price supports,\nthe businessman…supports an advocate of low corporation\ntaxes… the consumer…votes for candidates opposed to a\nsale tax” (Dahl 1959, p. 69). In this conception of the\ndemocratic process, each citizen is a member of an interest group with\nnarrowly defined interests that are closely connected to their\neveryday lives.  On these subjects citizens are supposed to be quite\nwell informed and interested in having an influence. Or at least,\nelites from each of the interest groups that are relatively close in\nperspective to the ordinary members are the principal agents in the\nprocess. On this account, democracy is not rule by the majority but\nrather rule by coalitions of minorities. Policy and law in a\ndemocratic society are decided by means of bargaining among the\ndifferent groups. \n This approach is conceivably compatible with the more egalitarian\napproach to democracy. This is because it attempts to reconcile\nequality with collective decision making by limiting the tasks of\ncitizens to ones which they are able to perform reasonably well. And it\nattempts to do this in a way that gives citizens a key role in decision\nmaking. The account ensures that individuals can participate roughly as\nequals to the extent that it narrowly confines the issues each\nindividual is concerned with. It is not particularly compatible with\nthe deliberative public justification approach because it eschews\ndeliberation about the common good or about justice. And it takes the\ndemocratic process to be concerned essentially with bargaining among\nthe different interest groups where the preferences to be advanced by\neach group is not subject to further debate in the society as a whole.\nTo be sure, there might be some deliberation within interest groups but\nit will not be society wide. \n\nA third approach inspired by the problem of citizenship may be called\nthe neo-liberal approach to politics favored by public choice\ntheorists such as James Buchanan & Gordon Tullock (1965). Against\nelite theories, they contend that elites and their allies will tend to\nexpand the powers of government and bureaucracy for their own\ninterests and that this expansion will occur at the expense of a\nlargely inattentive public. For this reason, they argue for severe\nrestrictions on the powers of elites. They argue against the interest\ngroup pluralist theorists that the problem of participation occurs\nwithin interest groups more or less as much as among the citizenry at\nlarge.  As a consequence, interest groups will not form very\neasily. Only those interest groups that are guided by powerful\neconomic interests are likely to succeed in organizing to influence\nthe government. Hence, only some interest groups will succeed in\ninfluencing government and they will do so largely for the benefit of\nthe powerful economic elites that fund and guide them. Furthermore,\nthey argue that such interest groups will tend to produce highly\ninefficient government because they will attempt to advance their\ninterests in politics while spreading the costs to others. The\nconsequence of this is that policies will be created that tend to be\nmore costly (because imposed on everyone in society) than they are\nbeneficial (because they benefit only the elites in the interest\ngroup.) \n Neo-liberals argue that any way of organizing a large and powerful\ndemocratic state is likely to produce serious inefficiencies. They\ninfer that one ought to transfer many of the current functions of the\nstate to the market and limit the state to the enforcement of basic\nproperty rights and liberties. These can be more easily understood and\nbrought under the control of ordinary citizens. \n But the neo-liberal account of democracy must answer to two large\nworries. First, citizens in modern societies have more ambitious\nconceptions of social justice and the common good than are realizable\nby the minimal state. The neo-liberal account thus implies a very\nserious curtailment of democracy of its own. More evidence is needed to\nsupport the contention that these aspirations cannot be achieved by the\nmodern state. Second, the neo-liberal approach ignores the problem of\nlarge private concentrations of wealth and power that are capable of\npushing small states around for their own benefit and imposing their\nwills on populations without their consent. The assumptions that lead\nneo-liberals to be skeptical about the large modern state imply equally\ndisturbing problems for the large private concentrations of wealth in a\nneo-liberal society. \n\nA considerable amount of the literature in political science and the\neconomic theory of the state are grounded in the assumption that\nindividuals act primarily and perhaps even exclusively in their\nself-interest narrowly construed. The problem of participation and the\naccounts of the democratic process described above are in large part\ndependent on this assumption. While these ideas have generated\ninteresting results and have become ever more sophisticated, there has\nbeen a growing chorus of opponents. Against the self-interest axiom,\ndefenders of deliberative democracy and others claim that citizens are\ncapable of being motivated by a concern for the common good and\njustice. And they claim, with Mill and Rousseau, that such concerns\nare not merely given prior to politics but that they can evolve and\nimprove through the process of discussion and debate in politics. They\nassert that much debate and discussion in politics would not be\nintelligible were it not for the fact that citizens are willing to\nengage in open minded discussion with those who have distinct morally\ninformed points of view. Empirical evidence suggests that individuals\nare motivated by moral considerations in politics in addition to their\ninterests.  Accordingly, many propose that democratic institutions be\ndesigned to support the inclination to engage in moral and open-minded\ndiscussion with others (see the essays in Mansbridge 1990). \n\nOnce we approach the idea of citizenship from a moral point of view\nand we recognize the importance of a division of labor, the question\narises, what is the appropriate role for a citizen in a democracy? If\nwe think that citizens are too often uninformed we should ask two\nquestions. What ought citizens have knowledge about in order to\nfulfill their role? What standards ought citizens’ beliefs live\nup to in order to be adequately supported? Some, such as Dahl in the\nabove quote, have proposed that citizens know about their particular\nsectors of society and not others. We have seen that this view has a\nnumber of difficulties. Christiano proposes, along with others, that\ncitizens must think about what ends the society ought to aim at and\nleave the question of how to achieve those aims to experts\n(Christiano 1996, chap. 5). This kind of view needs to answer to the\nproblem of how to ensure that politicians, administrators and experts\nactually do attempt to realize the aims set by citizens. And it must\nshow how institutions can be designed so as to establish the division\nof labor while preserving equality among citizens. But if citizens\ngenuinely do choose the aims and others faithfully pursue the means to\nachieving those aims, then citizens are in the driver's seat in\nsociety. \n It is hard to see how citizens can satisfy any even moderate standards\nfor beliefs about out how best to achieve their political aims.\nKnowledge of means requires an immense amount of social science and\nknowledge of particular facts. For citizens to have this kind of\nknowledge generally would require that we abandon the division of labor\nin society. On the other hand, citizens do have first hand and daily\nexperience with thinking about the values and aims they pursue. This\ngives them a chance to satisfy standards of belief regarding what the\nbest aims are. \n\nStill the view is not defensible without a compelling institutional\nanswer to the question of how to ensure that others are genuinely\npursuing the means to achieve the aims specified by citizens. On the\nproposed view, legislative representatives and bureaucrats as well as\njudges must subordinate their activities to the task of figuring out\nhow to pursue the aims of citizens. There is a huge principal/agent\nproblem here. \n\nFurthermore, we must ask, how must institutions be designed in order\nto reconcile the demand for equality among citizens with the need for a\ndivision of labor? We will discuss one dimension of this issue in the\nquestion of legislative representation. \n\nA number of debates have centered on the question of what kinds of\nlegislative institution are best for a democratic society. What choice\nwe make here will depend heavily on our underlying ethical\njustification of democracy, our conception of citizenship as well as on\nour empirical understanding of political institutions and how they\nfunction. The most basic types of formal political representation\navailable are single member district representation, proportional\nrepresentation and group representation. In addition, many societies\nhave opted for multicameral legislative institutions. In some cases,\ncombinations of the above forms have been tried. \n Single member district representation returns single representatives of\ngeographically defined areas containing roughly equal populations to\nthe legislature and is present most prominently in the United States\nand the United Kingdom. The most common form of proportional\nrepresentation is party list proportional representation. In a simple\nform of such a scheme, a number of parties compete for election to a\nlegislature that is not divided into geographical districts. Parties\nacquire seats in the legislature as a proportion of the total number of\nvotes they receive in the voting population as a whole. Group\nrepresentation occurs when the society is divided into\nnon-geographically defined groups such as ethnic or linguistic groups\nor even functional groups such as workers, farmers and capitalists and\nreturns representatives to a legislature from each of them. \n\nMany have argued in favor of single member district legislation on\nthe grounds that it has appeared to them to lead to more stable\ngovernment than other forms of representation. The thought is that\nproportional representation tends to fragment the citizenry into\nopposing homogeneous camps that rigidly adhere to their party lines and\nthat are continually vying for control over the government. Since there\nare many parties and they are unwilling to compromise with each other,\ngovernments formed from coalitions of parties tend to fall apart rather\nquickly. The post war experience of governments in Italy appears to\nconfirm this hypothesis. Single member district representation, in\ncontrast, is said to enhance the stability of governments by virtue of\nits favoring a two party system of government. Each election cycle then\ndetermines which party is to stay in power for some length of time. \n Charles Beitz argues (1989, chap. 7) that single member district\nrepresentation encourages moderation in party programs offered for\ncitizens to consider. This results from the tendency of this kind of\nrepresentation towards two party systems. In a two party system with\nmajority rule, it is argued, each party must appeal to the median\nvoter in the political spectrum. Hence, they must moderate their\nprograms to appeal to the median voter. Furthermore, they encourage\ncompromise among groups since they must try to appeal to a lot of\nother groups in order to become part of one of the two leading\nparties. These tendencies encourage moderation and compromise in\ncitizens to the extent that political parties, and interest groups,\nhold these qualities up as necessary to functioning well in a\ndemocracy. \n In criticism, advocates of proportional and group representation have\nargued that single member district representation tends to muffle the\nvoices and ignore the interests of minority groups in the society.\nMinority interests and views tend to be articulated in background\nnegotiations and in ways that muffle their distinctiveness.\nFurthermore, representatives of minority interests and views often have\na difficult time getting elected at all in single member district\nsystems so it has been charged that minority views and interests are\noften systematically underrepresented. Sometimes these problems are\ndealt with by redrawing the boundaries of districts in a way that\nensures greater minority representation. The efforts are invariably\nquite controversial since there is considerable disagreement about the\ncriteria for apportionment. In proportional representation, by\ncontrast, representatives of different groups are seated in the\nlegislature in proportion to citizens’ choices. Minorities need\nnot make their demands conform to the basic dichotomy of views and\ninterests that characterize single member district systems so their\nviews are more articulated and distinctive as well as better\nrepresented. \n Another criticism of single member district representation is that it\nencourages parties to pursue dubious electoral campaign strategies. The\nneed to appeal to a large, diverse and somewhat amorphous sector of the\npopulation can very often be best met by using ambiguous, vague and\noften quite irrelevant appeals to the citizens. Thus instead of\nencouraging reasonable compromise the scheme tends to support\ntendencies towards ignorance, superficiality and fatuousness in\npolitical campaigns and in the citizenry. It encourages political\nleaders to take care of the real issues of politics in back rooms while\nthey appeal to citizens by means of smoke and mirrors. Of course, those\nwho agree in the main with the elitist type theories will see nothing\nwrong in this, indeed they may well champion this effect. Proportional\nrepresentation requires that parties be relatively clear and up front\nabout their proposals, so those who believe that democracy is ethically\ngrounded in the appeal to equality tend to favor proportional\nrepresentation (see Christiano 1996, chap. 6). \n Advocates of group representation, like Iris Marion Young (1990,\nchap. 6), have argued that some historically disenfranchised groups\nmay still not do very well under proportional representation. They may\nnot be able to organize and articulate their views as easily as other\ngroups. Also, minority groups can still be systematically defeated in\nthe legislature and their interests may be consistently set back even\nif they do have some representation. For these groups, some have\nargued that the only way to protect their interests is legally to\nensure that they have adequate and even disproportionate\nrepresentation. \n One worry about group representation is that it tends to freeze some\naspects of the agenda that might be better left to the choice of\ncitizens. For instance, consider a population that is divided into\nlinguistic groups for a long time. And suppose that only some citizens\ncontinue to think of linguistic conflict as important. In the\ncircumstances a group representation scheme may tend to be biased in an\narbitrary way that favors the views or interests of those who do think\nof linguistic conflict as important. \n\nSince democracy is a collective decision process, the question\nnaturally arises about whether there is any obligation of citizens to\nobey the democratic decision. In particular, the question arises as to\nwhether a citizen has an obligation to obey the democratic decision\nwhen he or she disagrees with it. \n There are three main concepts of the legitimate authority of the state.\nFirst, a state has legitimate authority to the extent that it is\nmorally justified in imposing its rule on the members. Legitimate\nauthority on this account has no direct implications concerning the\nobligations or duties that citizens may hold toward that state. It\nsimply says that if the state is morally justified in doing what it\ndoes, then it has legitimate authority. Second, a state has legitimate\nauthority to the extent that its directives generate duties in citizens\nto obey. The duties of the citizens need not be owed to the state but\nthey are real duties to obey. The third is that the state has a right\nto rule that is correlated with the citizens’ duty to it to obey\nit. This is the strongest notion of authority and it seems to be the\ncore idea behind the legitimacy of the state. The idea is that when\ncitizens disagree about law and policy it is important to be able to\nanswer the question, who has the right to choose? \n\nWith respect to democracy we can imagine three main approaches to the\nquestion as to whether democratic decisions have authority. First, we\ncan appeal to perfectly general conceptions of legitimate\nauthority. Some have thought that the question of authority is\nindependent entirely of whether a state is democratic. Consent\ntheories of political authority and instrumentalist conceptions of\npolitical authority state general criteria of political authority that\ncan be met by non democratic as well as democratic states. Second,\nsome have thought that there is a conceptual link between democracy\nand authority such that if a decision is made democratically then it\nmust therefore have authority. Third, some have thought that there are\ngeneral principles of political authority that are uniquely realized\nby a democratic state under certain well defined conditions. \n\nReaders who are interested in more general conceptions of political\nauthority may consult the entry for political authority for a\ndiscussion of the issues. And the second kind of view has been largely\nabandoned by democratic theorists. I do wish to discuss the third kind\nof conception of the political authority of democracy. \n\nIn general, instrumentalist conceptions of authority make no special\nmention of democracy. The instrumental arguments for democracy give\nsome reason for why one ought to respect the democracy when one\ndisagrees with its decisions. But there may be many other instrumental\nconsiderations that play a role in deciding on the question of whether\none ought to obey. And these instrumental considerations are pretty\nmuch the same whether one is considering obedience to democracy or some\nother form of rule. \n There is one instrumentalist approach which is quite unique to\ndemocracy and that seems to ground a strong conception of democratic\nauthority. That is the approach inspired by the Condorcet Jury Theorem\n(Goodin, 2003, chap. 5; Estlund, 2002, 77-80).  According to this\ntheorem, on issues where there are two alternatives and there is a\ncorrect answer as to which one is correct, if voters have on average a\nbetter than even chance of getting the right answer, the majority is\nmore likely to have the right answer than anyone in the minority. And\nthe likelihood that the majority is right increases as the size of the\nvoting population increases. In very large populations, the chance\nthat the majority is right approaches certainty. The theorem is an\ninstance of the law of large numbers. If each voter has an\nindependently better than 0.5 chance of getting the right answer then\nthe probability that more than 0.5 of the voters get the right answer\napproaches 1 as the number of voters becomes very large. \n Such a result makes sense of Rousseau's famous passage: “Each\ncitizen, in giving his suffrage, states his mind on that question\n[concerning what the general will is]; and the general will is found\nby counting the votes. When, therefore, the motion which I opposed\ncarries, it only proves to me that I was mistaken and that what I\nbelieved to be the general will was not so” (Rousseau 1762,\n95-96).  On this account, we have a conception of the authority of\ndemocracy.  The members of the minority have a powerful reason for\nshifting their allegiance to the majority position, since each has\nvery good reason to think that the majority is right. \n There are a number of difficulties with the application of the\nCondorcet Jury Theorem to the case of voting in elections and\nreferenda. First, many have remarked that voters’ opinions are\nnot independent of each other. Indeed, the democratic process seems to\nemphasize persuasion and coalition building. And the theorem only works\non independent trials. Second, the theorem does not seem to apply to\ncases in which the information that voters have access to, and on the\nbasis of which they make their judgments, is segmented in various ways\nso that some sectors of the society do not have the relevant\ninformation while others do have it. And modern societies and politics\nseem to instantiate this kind of segmentation in terms of class, race,\nethnic groupings, religion, occupational position, geographical place\nand so on. One can always have good reason to think that the majority\nis not properly placed to make a reasonable decision on a certain issue\nwhen one is in the minority. Finally, all voters approach issues they\nhave to make decisions on with strong ideological biases thus\nundermining the sense that each voter is bringing a kind of independent\nobservation on the nature of the common good to the vote. \n One further worry about the Condorcet Theorem's application seems to\nbe that it would prove too much anyway for it undermines the common\npractice of the loyal opposition in democracies. Indeed, even in\nscientific communities the fact that a majority of scientists favor a\nparticular view does not make the minority scientists think that they\nare wrong, though it does perhaps give them pause (Goodin 2003,\nchap. 7). \n\nSome consent theorists have thought that there is a special relation\nbetween democracy and legitimate authority at least under certain\nconditions. John Locke argues (1690, sec. 96) that when a person\nconsents to the creation of a political society, he necessarily\nconsents to the use of majority rule in deciding how the political\nsociety is to be organized.  Locke thinks that majority rule is the\nnatural decision rule when there are no other ones. He argues that\nonce a society is formed it must move in the direction of the greater\nforce. One way to understand this argument is as follows. If we think\nof each member of society as an equal and if we think that there is\nlikely to be disagreement beyond the question of whether to join\nsociety or not, then we must accept majority rule as the appropriate\ndecision rule. This interpretation of the greater force argument\nassumes that the expression “greater force” is to be\nunderstood in terms of the equal worth of each person's interests and\nrights, so the society must go in the direction in which the greater\nnumber of persons wants it to go. \n\nTo be sure, Locke thinks that a people, which is formed by individuals\nin consenting to be members, could choose a monarchy by means of\nmajority rule and so this argument by itself does not give us an\nargument for democracy. But Locke refers back to this argument when he\ndefends the requirement of representative institutions for deciding\nwhen property may be regulated and when taxes may be levied. He argues\nthat a person must consent to the regulation or taxation of his\nproperty by the state. But he says that this requirement of consent is\nsatisfied when a majority of the representatives of property holders\nconsent to the regulation and taxation of property (Locke, 1690,\nsec. 140). This does seem to be moving towards a genuinely democratic\nconception of legitimate authority. How democratic this conception is\ndepends on how we understand property in Locke's discussion. If it\nincludes the rights of citizens generally, then we have an argument\nfor democratic decision making. But if the idea of property only\nincludes holders of private property then we have an argument for, at\nbest, a highly attenuated form of democratic decision making. \n\nAnother consent-based argument for the claim that democracy is\nnecessary for legitimate authority asserts that when people\nparticipate in the democratic process, by their act of participation\nthey consent to the outcome, even if it goes against them. Their\nparticipation thereby lends legitimacy to the outcome and perhaps even\nto the democratic assembly that is elected by citizens. On this\naccount, the acts of voting, for example, are also acts of consent to\nthe outcome of the voting. So participants are thereby obligated to\ncomply with the decision made by the majority. \n\nThe problem with all these variations on consent theory is that they\nface a worrisome dilemma. On the one hand, they seem to involve highly\nsuspect interpretations of behaviors that may or may not imply the\nkinds of consent that these theorists have in mind. Hume's worries\nabout consent theorists’ interpreting residence in a territory\nas consent to its government have close analogs in this kind of\ncontext (Hume, 1748, p. 263). Why suppose that a person's vote is\nunderstood by that person to be consent to the outcome of the\nvote. Why not suppose that the person is merely trying to have an\nimpact on the outcome? Or why suppose that a person's membership in\nsociety—the “consent” signaled by remaining in the\nsociety—really commits him to agreeing that decisions must be\nmade by majority rule? \n\nOn the other hand, if we eschew the interpretative route the only way\nto think of the person's vote as constituting consent is if we think\nthat the person ought to consent to the outcome or ought to know that\nhe is consenting to the outcome. The fact that they ought to consent\nto the outcome because they have participated is sufficient, on some\nviews, to produce an obligation. And the thesis that they ought to\nknow that they consent is usually grounded in the idea that it they\nought to be consenting when they vote. But this kind of view seems to\nget far away from the basic idea of consent theorists, which is that\nwhether persons consent or not should be up to them and should not be\ndetermined by the correct moral view. Consent theory is grounded in\nthe need a way to think of government has legitimacy when people\ndisagree about whether it is just or right. \n\nThe liberty approaches to the justification of democracy provide\nalternative approaches to the idea of the authority of democracy. The\nidea here is that democracy has authority to the extent that people\nfreely bring about the democratic decision. The reason for this is that\ndemocracy merely extends their activity of self-determination to the\npolitical realm. To the extent that self-determination is an preeminent\nvalue and democracy extends it to the political realm, allegiance to\ndemocratic decisions is necessary to self-determination and therefore\nis required by virtue of the pre eminent importance of\nself-determination. \n But here is a worry about this kind of approach. It seems either to\npresuppose that decisions will have unanimous support or it requires a\nnumber of substantive conditions on self-determination, which\nconditions do a lot of the work of generating obligations to\ndemocracy.  For instance, if a decision must be made by majority rule,\none strategy for reconciling this with self-determination is to say\nthat a self-determining person must accept the legitimacy of majority\nrule when there is disagreement. This may be because the\nself-determining person must accept the fundamental importance of\nequality and majority rule is essential to equality under\ncircumstances of disagreement. So if one argues that one cannot be\nself-determining unless one accepts equality then one might be able to\nargue that the self-determining person must accept the results of\nmajority rule. But this argument seems to make the authority of\ndemocracy depend primarily on the importance of equality. And one must\nwonder about the importance of the idea of self-determination to the\naccount. \n\nAnother approach to the question of the authority of democracy asserts\nthat failing to obey the decisions of a democratic assembly amounts to\ntreating one's fellow citizens as inferiors (Christiano 2004,\n284-287). And this approach establishes the authority of democracy by\nclaiming that the inequality involved in failing to obey the\ndemocratic assembly is the most important form of inequality. It is\nmore important to treat persons as equals in political decision making\non this account than it is to treat them as equals in the economic\nsphere. The idea is that citizens will disagree on how to treat each\nother as equals in the areas of substantive law and policy. It is the\npurpose of democracy to make decisions when these disagreements\narise. Democracy realizes a kind of equality among persons that all\ncan share allegiance to even when they disagree about many matters\nrelating to substantive law and policy. Since democracy realizes\nequality in a highly public manner and publicity is a great and\negalitarian value, the equality realized by democracy trumps other\nkinds of equality. \n\nThe conception of democracy as grounded in public equality provides\nsome reason to think that democratic equality must have some\npre-eminence over other kinds of equality. The idea is that public\nequality is the most important form of equality and that democracy, as\nwell as some other principles such as liberal rights, are unique\nrealizations of public equality. The other forms of equality in play in\nsubstantive disputes about law and policy are ones about which people\ncan have reasonable disagreements (within limits specified by the\nprinciple of public equality). So the principle of public equality\nrequires that one treat others publicly as equals and democracy is\nnecessary to doing this. Since public equality has precedence over\nother forms of equality, citizens have obligations to abide by the\ndemocratic process even if their favored conceptions of equality are\npassed by in the decision making process. \n\nOf course, there will be limits on what citizens must accept from a\ndemocratic assembly. And these limits, on the egalitarian account, must\nbe understood as deriving from the fundamental value of equality. So,\none might think that public equality also requires protection of\nliberal rights and perhaps even the provision of an economic\nminimum. \n\nIf democracy does have authority, what are the limits to that\nauthority? A limit to democratic authority is a principle violation of\nwhich defeats democratic authority. When the principle is violated by\nthe democratic assembly, the assembly loses its authority in that\ninstance or the moral weight of the authority is overridden. A number\nof different views have been offered on this issue. First, it is\nworthwhile to distinguish between different kinds of moral limit to\nauthority. We might distinguish between internal and external limits\nto democratic authority. An internal limit to democratic authority is\na limit that arises from the requirements of democratic process or a\nlimit that arises from the principles that underpin democracy. An\nexternal limit on the authority of democracy is a limit that arises\nfrom principles that are independent of the values or requirements of\ndemocracy.  Furthermore, some limits to democratic authority are\nrebutting limits, which are principles that weigh in the balance\nagainst the principles that support democratic decision making. Some\nconsiderations may simply outweigh in importance the considerations\nthat support democratic authority. So in a particular case, an\nindividual may see that there are reasons to obey the assembly and\nsome reasons against obeying the assembly and in the case at hand the\nreasons against obedience outweigh the reasons in favor of\nobedience. \n\nOn the other hand some limits to democratic authority are undercutting\nlimits. These limits function not by weighing against the\nconsiderations in favor of authority, they undercut the considerations\nin favor of authority altogether; they simply short circuit the\nauthority. When an undercutting limit is in play, it is not as if the\nprinciples which ground the limit outweigh the reasons for obeying the\ndemocratic assembly, it is rather that the reasons for obeying the\ndemocratic assembly are undermined altogether; they cease to exist or\nat least they are severely weakened. \n\nSome have argued that the democratic process ought to be limited to\ndecisions that are not incompatible with the proper functioning of the\ndemocratic process. So they argue that the democratic process may not\nlegitimately take away the political rights of its citizens in good\nstanding. It may not take away rights that are necessary to the\ndemocratic process such as freedom of association or freedom of speech.\nBut these limits do not extend beyond the requirements for proper\ndemocratic functioning. They do not protect non political artistic\nspeech or freedom of association in the case of non political\nactivities (Ely 1980, chap. 4). \n Another kind of internal limit is a limit that arises from the\nprinciples that underpin democracy. And the presence of this limit\nwould seem to be necessary to making sense of the first limit because\nin order for the first limit to be morally important we need to know\nwhy a democracy ought to protect the democratic process. \n Locke (1690, chap. XI) gives an account of the internal limits of\ndemocracy in his idea that there are certain things to which a citizen\nmay not consent. She may not consent to arbitrary rule or the\nviolation of fundamental rights including democratic and liberal\nrights. To the extent that consent is the basis of democratic\nauthority for Locke, this suggests that there are limits to what a\ndemocratic assembly may do that derive from the very principles that\nground the authority. And these limits simply undermine the right of\nthe assembly to rule in these cases since they are not things to which\ncitizens can consent. This account provides an explanation of the idea\nbehind the first internal limit, that democracy may not be suspended\nby democratic means but it goes beyond that limit to suggest that\nrights that are not essentially connected with the exercise of the\nfranchise may also not be violated because one may not consent to\ntheir violation. \n The conception of democratic authority that grounds it in public\nequality also provides an account of the limits of that authority.\nSince democracy is founded in public equality, it may not violate\npublic equality in any of its decisions. The basic idea is that overt\nviolation of public equality by a democratic assembly undermines the\nclaim that the democratic assembly embodies public equality.\nDemocracy's embodiment of public equality is conditional on its\nprotecting public equality. To the extent that liberal rights are\ngrounded in public equality and the provision of an economic minimum is\nalso so grounded, this suggests that democratic rights and liberal\nrights and rights to an economic minimum create a limit to democratic\nauthority. This account also provides a deep grounding for the kinds of\nlimits to democratic authority defended in the first internal limit and\nit goes beyond these to the extent that protection of rights that are\nnot connected with the exercise of the franchise is also necessary to\npublic equality. \n\nThis account of the authority of democracy also provides some help\nwith a vexing problem of democratic theory. This problem is the\ndifficulty of persistent minorities. There is a persistent minority in\na democratic society when that minority always loses in the voting.\nThis is always a possibility in democracies because of the use of\nmajority rule. If the society is divided into two or more highly\nunified voting blocks in which the members of each group votes\nin the same ways as all the other members of that group, then the group\nin the minority will find itself always on the losing end of the votes.\nThis problem has plagued some societies, particularly those with\nindigenous peoples who live within developed societies. Though this\nproblem is often connected with majority tyranny it is distinct from\nthe problem of majority tyranny because it may be the case that the\nmajority attempts to treat the minority well, in accordance with its\nconception of good treatment. It is just that the minority never agrees\nwith the majority on what constitutes proper treatment. Being a\npersistent minority can be highly oppressive even if the majority does\nnot try to act oppressively. This can be understood with the help of\nthe very ideas that underpin democracy. Persons have interests in being\nable to correct for the cognitive biases of others and to be able to\nmake the world in such a way that it makes sense to them. These\ninterests are set back for a persistent minority since they never get\ntheir way. \n The conception of democracy as grounded in public equality can shed\nlight on this problem. It can say that the existence of a persistent\nminority violates public equality. In effect, a society in which there\nis a persistent minority is one in which that minority is being\ntreated publicly as an inferior because it is clear that its\nfundamental interests are being set back. Hence to the extent that\nviolations of public equality undercut the authority of a democratic\nassembly, the existence of a persistent minority undermines the\nauthority of the democracy at least with respect to the minority. This\nsuggests that certain institutions ought to be constructed so that the\nminority is not persistent. \n\nOne natural kind of limit to democratic authority is the external\nrebutting kind of limit. Here the idea is that there are certain\nconsiderations that favor democratic decision making and there are\ncertain values that are independent of democracy that may be at issue\nin democratic decisions. Some views may assert that there are only\nexternal limits to democratic authority. But it is possible to think\nthat there are both internal and external limits. Such an issue may\narise in decisions to go to war, for example. In such decisions, one\nmay have a duty to obey the decision of the democratic assembly on the\ngrounds that this is how one treats one's fellow citizens as\nequals but one may also have a duty to oppose the war on the grounds\nthat the war is an unjust aggression against other people. To the\nextent that this consideration is sufficiently serious it may outweigh\nthe considerations of equality that underpin democratic authority. Thus\none may have an overall duty not to obey in this context. Issues of\nforeign policy in general seem to give rise to possible external\nrebutting limits to democracy.","contact.mail":"thomasc@u.arizona.edu","contact.domain":"u.arizona.edu"}]
