In such contexts claims about need are often\nthought to carry significant weight. By contrast, the role that needs\nshould play in normative reasoning is contested among philosophers. In\nthis article we discuss several core issues concerning needs in\ncontemporary moral and political philosophy. We begin by discussing\nthe normativity of needs and some of the disputes concerning the\nsignificance of needs claims.\n\n\n\nWe then canvass some reasons to be skeptical about needs and their\nability to do any useful work in moral and political philosophy.\nThese include skepticism about the objectivity of needs and therefore\nconcerns about whether needs claims can ground relevant obligations.\nSome also maintain that distribution according to need is undesirable,\nfor instance because it is essentially paternalistic, or because it\ncan result in being confronted with an overly burdensome and possibly\nendless series of demands. In response to such potential problems we\ndiscuss widely used strategies for disarming the main forms of\nskepticism and evaluate their success. \n\n\n\nOn the face of it, human beings can claim to have a wide variety of\nneeds. Which needs warrant normative attention? We discuss some\ninfluential recent accounts of the needs that matter morally, along\nwith the arguments offered for why those needs are special. Here we\ndiscuss influential work by Harry Frankfurt, David Braybrooke, David\nWiggins, David Miller, Len Doyal, and Ian Gough. While there are\nseveral common elements to these accounts, there are also important\ndifferences.\n\n\n\nWe then discuss needs in recent theories of distributive\njustice. Given the role needs seem to play in popular discourse about\nsocial justice it may seem odd that needs have largely been ignored by\ncontemporary theorists concerned with distributive justice. But by\nmeans of a wide trawl through the dominant theories, we show that this\nis indeed the case. We offer some explanations for this apparently odd\nphenomenon.\n\n\n\nMarx is well known for maintaining that a communist society would\naspire to distribute resources according to the principle “from\neach according to his ability, to each according to his needs”\n(Marx 1977, 569). What would distribution according to need entail?\nWe outline several possibilities, showing strengths and weaknesses\nwith each interpretation. However, as we highlight, there is no\nuniquely defensible or best way of understanding what the principle of\ndistribution according to need requires in all cases.\n\n\n\nA needs-based approach played an important role in global public\npolicy, especially concerning addressing poverty and human\ndevelopment, in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, the capabilities\napproach replaced it in the late 1980s. Policy-makers appeared to lose\nconfidence in a needs-based approach and capabilities were considered\nby many of the most influential decision-makers to offer a more\nsophisticated conceptual framework. We review some of the arguments on\nboth sides of this debate, discussing their strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\n\n\nIn our final section we identify some ways in which concern with needs\nextends to several contemporary debates, such as those concerning the\nscope and content of justice. What constraints do the needs of others\nwho are not proximate (either geographically or temporally) place on\nfair distributions within states, for instance? We note where more\nextended treatment of these concerns occurs in several other articles\nin this encyclopedia.\n\n\nThe role that needs should play in our practical reasoning is a hotly\ncontested topic. On one side stand philosophers who argue that the\nneeds of others always impose moral demands on us, or more strongly\nstill that the very idea of moral obligation cannot be understood\nexcept with reference to needs (see Reader 2007, chs. 4–5; Weil\n1952, 3–9). They are also likely to believe that meeting\nneeds should be a primary aim of public policy. On the other side\nstand philosophers who argue that needs are a false currency; they\nappear to be both objective and fundamental, but in fact are neither,\nsince claims of need always make tacit reference to some further end\nfor which the thing claimed is necessary (Barry 1965, 47–9;\nFlew 1981, ch. 5; White 1975, ch. 8). Moreover in politics, appeals to\nneed are not only misleading, but dangerous, because the obligations\nthey apparently impose can serve to justify indefinitely expanding the\nscope of government at the expense of individual freedom (Minogue\n1963, ch. 4). \n\nHow should we respond to this contest? It is tempting to sidestep the\ncontroversy over needs by substituting other concepts that cover some\nof the same terrain but are viewed as less contestable—such as\nresources, welfare, or capabilities—and as we shall see later,\nneeds have played a smaller part than one might expect in recent\npolitical philosophy. Yet there remains something compelling about the\nidea of need. To say that a human being is in need—is ill, or\nstarving, or threatened by danger—seems on the face of it to\nidentify a state of affairs that calls for immediate remedy. In\neveryday life, the language of need is pervasive. We talk constantly\nof the needs of children, the elderly, the poor, the sick, the lonely,\nand so on. We should not be too quick, therefore, to assume that\nneeds-talk can easily be replaced by some other idiom. Instead we\nshould try to understand how the controversy has arisen, and whether\nit can be resolved by more careful specification of the needs claims\nthat have non-derivative practical force. \n\nA good place to start is with the question whether claims of the form\n‘\\(A\\) needs \\(X\\)’ are always elliptical, that is whether\nthey are always opaque unless filled out by supplying the end, \\(Y\\),\nfor which \\(X\\) is needed. Clearly many need statements have that\nproperty. If I say ‘Mary needs a hat’, then unless the\ncontext makes it clear already, it is apposite to ask ‘What does\nshe need the hat for?’ to which the answer might be ‘To\navoid getting sunburnt’. Yet other need claims seem not to be\nelliptical in that way. If I say ‘the baby needs its diaper\nchanged’, it would be more than a little bizarre to ask\n‘what for?’. Although it would no doubt be possible\nformally to expand the sentence by specifying a goal, no fresh\ninformation would be supplied to anyone who already knew what a baby\nwas and what a diaper was, whereas in the case of Mary’s hat,\nthe reference to sunburn does genuine explanatory work by displacing\nother reasons that Mary might have for needing suitable headgear. \n\nIt matters whether or not all need statements are elliptical because\nthis is connected to the further question whether need claims can have\nindependent justificatory force. For those who deny this, such as\nBarry, the fact that need claims always require spelling out in the\nform ‘\\(A\\) needs \\(X\\) in order to \\(Y\\)’ shows that what\nmatters normatively are always the \\(Y\\) items, the ends for which the\nthings needed are necessary. Barry concedes that there are\n‘core’ cases of human need where the context makes it\nclear that the ends being invoked fall within a narrow range (health,\nfor instance), yet concludes that ‘this modification does not\naffect my thesis that no special account has to be taken of\n“need”, for it is still derivative and the only\ninteresting questions arise in connection with the ends’ (Barry\n1965, 49). \n\nOthers, however, deny this. For Wiggins, the problem with the claim\nthat all need claims are elliptical is that it blurs the distinction\nbetween the instrumental sense of ‘need’, where the\npurpose for which the claimed item is needed might be almost anything,\nand the categorical sense where ‘the purpose is already fixed,\nand fixed by virtue of the meaning of the word’ (Wiggins 1998,\n9). In the case of categorical needs, needed items are things that\nhuman beings must have to avoid being harmed, but it is a mistake to\nsee ‘avoidance of harm’ as a further end that explains why\nthe need is a need; instead it is already present in the idea of need\nitself. A similar argument is made by Thomson (1987), though using a\ndifferent vocabulary of derivative and basic needs. Of course these\nanalyses of the concept of need do not yet tell us what our\ncategorical or basic needs are. It is uncontroversial to say that the\nresources without which a human being could not survive, such as food\nand water, count as needs. But how far beyond this does the concept\nstretch? Could needs that only some people have count as categorical,\nfor example? We return to this question in section 3 below when we\ndiscuss different substantive theories of need. \n\nConsider next the alleged normative force of need claims. They are\noften singled out for discussion because on the one hand whether\nsomebody has a need seems to be a matter of fact, while on the other\nthe existence of the need once established seems to constitute a\nreason for acting so as to fulfil it. If John, who has a migraine,\nneeds a painkiller (matter of fact), then I have a reason to give him\none (normative reason). So needs serve as a bridge between\n‘is’ and ‘ought’. Yet leaving aside general\ndoubts as to whether such bridge-building is possible, we need to\ntread cautiously here. First, the thesis is only plausible in the case\nof categorical needs. In the case of instrumental needs, everything\nwill turn on the end for which the needed item is required. An\narsonist may need a match to start a fire, but there is no reason to\nhand him one. Second, even categorical needs only provide reasons for\naction when the need is presently unfulfilled. So we need to draw a\ndistinction between ‘occurrent’ and\n‘dispositional’ needs (Thomson 1987, 11–12;\nReader 2007, 71). A dispositional need is a general need that human\nbeings have, like the need for sleep. But whether a person has an\noccurrent need for sleep depends on whether he has just woken up after\na good night’s rest or on the contrary has been unable to sleep\nfor the last twenty-four hours. It is only in the latter case, where\nthe need is occurrent, that others have a reason to meet it by\noffering the sleep-deprived person a bed to lie on. \n\nWhat kinds of reason for action do basic needs create? Needs are\nsometimes described as ‘morally demanding’, and therefore\nas directly generating moral obligations on the part of those who can\nfulfil them (Reader 2007, chs. 4–6). But what kind of\nobligation? Some philosophers writing in defence of care ethics take\nresponding to need as the paradigm case of, or even definitive of, a\ncaring relationship. For Bubeck, for example, ‘caring for is the\nmeeting of the needs of one person by another person where\nface-to-face interaction between carer and cared for is a crucial\nelement of the overall activity and where the need is of such a nature\nthat it cannot possibly be met by the person in need herself’\n(Bubeck 1995, 129). This is echoed by Held (2006, 10):\n‘the central focus of the ethics of care is on the compelling\nmoral salience of attending to and meeting the needs of the particular\nothers for whom we take responsibility’. However it would be a\nmistake to think that needs only have moral relevance in the context\nof caring relationships, even if it is within those relationships that\nthey can be responded to most fully. For meeting needs is also\nsometimes demanded as a matter of justice: we explore the relationship\nbetween needs and justice more fully in section 4 below. We can see\nthis most clearly in circumstances where resources are not plentiful\nenough to meet everyone’s needs in full. Then we face the\nproblem of how to distribute them, and the principle we use to solve\nit will be a principle of justice.  ‘To each according to their\nneeds’ has over the last two centuries often been held up as the\nhighest principle of distributive justice, although as we shall see in\nsection 5 there are a number of different ways in which the\nrequirement to distribute scarce resources\naccording to need can be interpreted. Those who want to\ndefend the supremacy of care as a moral value acknowledge that justice\nof this kind must have a place within caring relationships (Held 2006,\nch. 4). The caring parent, for instance, must pay equal attention\nto the various different needs of each of his or her children. \n\nWhere a caring relationship already exists, it is easy to identify the\nperson who has the moral obligation to meet another’s needs, but\nthis raises the question whether needs as such can impose obligations\non those who have the means to satisfy them, or whether there must\nalready be a pre-existing relationship that explains why Alfred has an\nobligation to meet Betty’s needs. Reader (2007, 72) defends\nthe view that ‘need only constitutes an actual moral demand in\nthe context of a moral relationship’. But she is obliged to\nstretch the idea of a moral relationship to deal with emergency\nsituations in which we intuitively think that rescuers are obliged to\ncome to the aid of complete strangers when they can do so at little\ncost. She does so by arguing that ‘encounters’, even very\nbrief ones, should count as a form of moral relationship (Reader 2007,\n 74–5). This, however, is implausible if it is intended to\ninclude cases such as those in which the person in need is unaware of\nthe presence of her saviour (for example because she is lying\nunconscious). The relationship between rescuer and victim here\nconsists simply in the former’s physical capacity to carry out\nthe rescue at small cost: there is no person-to-person encounter\nbetween them prior to the rescue itself. So if we think that the\nrescuer in such cases does have an obligation to meet the needs of the\nvictim, then we must concede that human need alone can impose\nobligations in the absence of any further relationship between the two\nparties. \n\nA more nuanced view here would hold that it is only cases of extreme\nneed—where life itself or serious bodily harm is at\nstake—that can create such obligations between perfect\nstrangers. Where needs are less severe—for example our\npsychological needs for love or moral support—the obligation to\nmeet them falls only on those already connected to the person in\nneed. There is a parallel here to the debate in political morality\nabout the obligations of states to meet the needs of those inside and\noutside their borders, respectively. One view is that states are\nrequired to meet a quite extensive set of needs on the part of their\nown citizens (including, for example, needs for elaborate and\nexpensive forms of medical treatment), whereas their obligations to\noutsiders are more limited, and confined to cases such as famine or\nepidemic where lives are at risk. Others would challenge this\ndistinction, and argue that where needs are at stake states have a\nduty to be impartial, so that if state \\(S\\) is for some reason unable\nto meet the extensive needs of its own citizens, other states have a\n duty to step in and fill the gap (See \n global justice). \n\nMany kinds of concerns have been raised about needs playing an\nimportant role in moral and political philosophy. We might divide\nthese into two main categories. The first category focuses on whether\nor not we can identify clear criteria for determining needs,\nin particular those needs that are capable of playing such a role.  In\nthe second category the common theme is the inadequacy of need as a\nguide to our moral or political obligations. In the first part of this\nsection we canvass some of these common concerns and in section 2.3\nreview some common response strategies. \n\nFor need to play the fundamental normative role that its advocates\nenvisage, it seems essential that there should be a consensus on what\npeople really need. However, looking around at what people\nclaim to need, we seem to be confronted with diverse,\nsometimes conflicting, possibilities. Consider, for instance, how\nmembers of a Bedouin tribe may claim to need some camels, pita bread,\ngood copies of the Koran, and swords, in order to live a minimally good\nlife. By contrast, so-called Millennials living in New York might claim\nthat good Internet access, technological connectivity, and reliable\nmass transit systems are fundamental to their well-being. The\nconcern here is that we will be unable to derive one robust list of\nneeds that captures this variety, and is applicable to all\npeople. Even if we limit our focus to one particular society we\nwill note that there is still enormous variety in what people claim to\nneed. Some may claim to be unable to enjoy life without music,\nart, long walks in natural habitats, or a large group of like-minded\nfriends. Others might see no value in this list of reported\nessentials. Faced with such claims, how can real needs be\nidentified? \n\nPhilosophers who write about the concept of need are keen to emphasize\nhow needs differ from desires, wants, and preferences: we often want\nthings that we do not need, and equally we may not want what we need\nbecause we fail to recognize its importance to us (all of this seems\nabundantly clear when we observe the eating patterns of many young\nchildren). Since, in general, we only have weak reasons to satisfy\npeople’s desires and preferences, this contrast seems important\nif we want to maintain that meeting claims of need is morally\nobligatory (see e.g. Miller 2014, 20–22). \n\nYet on further reflection we may begin to doubt whether such a\ncategorical separation between needs and wants is feasible.  This\nrelates back to the first set of concerns already mentioned in\n2.1.1. We might observe that some things we once considered to be more\naptly described as preferences, desires or wants have widely come to\nbe thought of as needs. Examples of this phenomenon might include\naccess to computers, the Internet, television sets, refrigeration, and\ncentral heating, which are widely thought of as among the necessities\nof modern life. Given these changes over time concerning what is\nregarded as a need, the suspicion may arise that a need is nothing\nmore than a desire whose satisfaction has become socially expected,\nand therefore lacks the special moral force that its defenders claim\nfor it.  \n\nNeeds as grounds of distribution might be attacked by those who are\nkeen to promote the virtues of self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and\nsocial independence. Rather than demanding of others that they should\nmeet our needs, an objector might maintain that we should transcend\nour neediness, associated as it is with weakness, frailty,\nvulnerability, and other pathetic parts of our nature. Attending to\nneed can be debilitating for both giver and receiver, on this line of\nobjection. On the giver’s part, the demandingness of need is\nfelt to threaten her capacity to carry out her own plan of\nlife. Emerson gave vent to this thought: \n\nDo not tell me, as a good man did today, of my obligation to put all\npoor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee,\nthou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the\ncent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not\nbelong (Emerson 1901, 59). \n\nOn the receiver’s side, being dependent on others to meet our\nneeds renders us subservient to them. Consider Adam Smith’s\nremark: \n\nNothing tends so much to corrupt and enervate and debase the mind as\ndependency, and nothing gives such noble and generous notions of\nprobity as freedom and independence (Smith 1982 (originally\n1762–1763), 333). \n\nFor Smith, commercial exchange in a free market serves to prevent the\nnoted vices. Markets foster self-reliance, social independence, and\nexchange among equals, freeing us from relations of dominance,\nsubservience, and servility. \n\nIn addition, if the state is in the business of attending to\npeople’s needs, this raises the spectre of a bureaucratic, nanny\nstate fostering one-sided dependence among citizens. The idea of\ndistribution according to need, it is said, invokes or lends itself to\na passive conception of agency. Those to whom goods are distributed\nwill be seen as recipients of the state’s largesse. More\nworrisomely, the beneficiaries themselves may come to abandon the\nattempt to meet their own needs, as state policies promote a culture\nof dependence. This is destructive of people’s own sense of\ntheir agency and empowerment, and destructive of the very ethos a good\nsociety should be promoting.  We should instead be encouraging people\nto take responsibility for their own well-being. \n\nCritics argue that using need as a criterion of distribution lends\nitself to paternalism, authoritarianism, or abuse. To ensure parity of\ntreatment, an outside agency must decide what needs different people\nhave. But it may seem instead that people should be allowed the\nfreedom to decide for themselves what their needs are, how they should\nmatter, and what weight should attach to them compared with other\nconsiderations that might subjectively seem more important. Griffin\ngives the example of a group of scholars having to choose between an\nextension to their library and exercise equipment to promote their\nhealth (Griffin 1986, 45). The latter can be construed as a need,\nwhereas the former is only an informed desire, since it depends on\naims that are peculiar to the scholarly community. Yet, Griffin\nargues, it would be odd to say that there is an obligation to provide\nthe equipment that the scholars value less in preference to the\nresource that they value more. As those whose wellbeing is at issue,\nthe scholars should be the ones to make judgements about how to weigh\ntheir needs with other core aspects of their wellbeing.  \n\nIn short, distributing in accordance with needs allows too many\nopportunities for outsiders to get these matters wrong or to act\npaternalistically with regard to those they aim to assist.  It is best\nto have individuals be in charge of managing their needs in the\ncontexts of their own lives. \n\nHere the charge is that, once we think of needs as imposing\nobligations on us, there will be too many for us to satisfy. Some will\nbe especially demanding. Consider how many medical needs are in this\ncategory, such as needs for renal dialysis machines or needs\nassociated with organ transplantation. Even to attempt to meet all of\nthem would be excessively burdensome on those who are required to\nassist, whether as charity donors or taxpayers. \n\nThere are at least two kinds of concerns associated with this\n“bottomless pit” worry. Reflecting, for instance, on the\ncost of meeting medical needs within most high-income countries and\nthe fact that healthcare budgets are under significant pressures (even\nthough reasonably high proportions of public resources are allocated\nto healthcare), it seems that we cannot satisfy all the\nhealthcare needs that present themselves within our societies.  Given\nscientific and technical advances, there will be an indefinitely large\nnumber of possible new treatments to promote the quality of life and\nto prolong it. So since the healthcare budget is finite, and limited\nby competing demands on public funds, it seems that in this area needs\nare in principle insatiable: there will always be more that we might\ndo to fulfil them. \n\nThis in principle insatiability concern can easily transform into an\noverdemandingness concern if we extend the scope of the needs that we\nhave a responsibility to meet to other societies besides our own.\nConsider the vast number of people across the planet who have unmet\nneeds for healthcare alone, never mind all the other domains in which\ntheir needs go unfulfilled. One might easily conclude that if needs\nhave normative force, we will be overwhelmed by the apparent\nbottomless pits of needs that exist globally. \n\nMany philosophers have engaged with these kinds of objections. One\nstrategy frequently used to address concerns related to a lack of\nobjectivity is to argue that what counts as a need, especially one\nthat is to have normative importance, can be decided in principled\nways (e.g. Braybrooke 1987, Doyal and Gough 1991, Wiggins 1987).\nVarious authors delineate the principles differently though there is\nalso important convergence and overlap, as we discuss in section 3\nbelow. A common theme is that the needs that are normatively salient,\nespecially in political distribution, are those that are necessary,\nindispensable, or inescapable, given the kinds of creatures that we\nare and the requirements for functioning in social settings. \n\nAll authors grapple somewhat with the level at which we should specify\nwhat it is people need. While reflection on our common humanity might\nwell be an important source of understanding about what humans need,\nto articulate that more precisely we need to engage with particular\nsocial contexts to flesh out any lists that will apply within\nparticular societies and have purchase in policy matters.  One common\ndistinction in the literature is to differentiate between needs and\ntheir satisfiers. The idea is that we can give a fairly high-level\nstatement of our human needs, but for particular societies we will\noften require a more specific account of what forms the satisfiers could\ntake in those societal contexts. So to illustrate, we might say that\nall people need sufficient health and sufficient protection from\nenvironmental hazards. To specify what that amounts to for members of\nparticular societies, we need to examine threats to health\nin particular environments (along with whatever general ones\nalso apply to all human beings). Consider how prudent precautions for\nInuit will differ from those that are recommended in societies where\nmosquito-borne illnesses are rampant (even if it is also true that a\nnumber of similar precautions apply to both). And this will be the\ncase for all our human needs. Even when we make claims about our human\nneeds, the forms that satisfying those needs may take in particular\nsocieties can admit of huge variation. \n\nSo, differentiating between needs and their satisfiers plays an\nimportant role in explaining some of the diversity we see reflected\naround the world, along with some of the diversity we see within\nsocieties. Consider an intra-societal example. While we all might have\na need for appropriate recreation, the form this takes may well\nvary. For some, recreational needs are satisfied by listening to\nmusic, while for others nothing short of mountain walking will do. So\nwhile some people claim that they couldn’t possibly live without\nmusic, and other say the same about walking in the mountains, what\nthey are disagreeing about is satisfiers rather than basic human\nneeds. They can agree that there is a need for recreation even if they\ndisagree about the form satisfaction of the need should take for\nthem. \n\nAnother distinction that can often account for other examples of\napparent diversity is also worth mentioning. As David Braybrooke\nsuggests, there is a difference between ‘adventitious\nneeds’ and ‘course-of-life’ needs (Braybrooke 1987,\n29). Adventitious needs are those that become important given a\ncertain project, practice, or activity. But within one society not all\ncitizens may wish to undertake those activities. The needs may not be\nshared by all, even if it is true that the item claimed to be needed\nis indeed essential to undertake that activity. By contrast, a\ncourse-of-life need is one that is widely shared and is not dependent\non particular projects; during the course of human lives lived in that\nsociety, one typically needs items on the list. \n\nIn response to the concerns that distribution according to need is\nundesirable because it lends itself to paternalism, authoritarianism,\nundesirable conceptions of agency, or overwhelming demands, a common\napproach is to point out that each of the objections makes dispensable\nassumptions. For instance, why assume that the individuals whose needs\nare a target of policy will not play a role in the relevant\ndeterminations of what they need, how these might best be satisfied,\nor other important features of needs policy? In fact, on several\nimportant accounts, the decision procedures concerning how to settle\nquestions of need should include a range of individuals, including\nthose in need (Braybrooke 1987, Doyal and Gough 1991). So distribution\naccording to need is not automatically vulnerable to charges of\npaternalism, and the like. Particular decision-making procedures for\narriving at policies about needs may well be characterized in these\nterms, but this is not an inevitable feature of all such policies. \n\nThe concern about being overwhelmed by a bottomless pit of\nneeds-related responsibilities can be deflated similarly using various\nstrategies. One is to point out that claims of need might have\nvariable importance depending on key features such as the\nrelationships among relevant parties, resources available, and the\nburdens that meeting them would place on others (e.g. Copp 1998, Brock\n2009). And, of course, the issue of responsibilities that needs\ngenerate and how to distribute responsibilities for meeting needs is\nan enormous topic (e.g., Braybrooke 1987, Miller 1999, Miller 2007),\none that will be discussed below (for instance, in sections 4 and 5).\nFor now, it is worth pointing out that we need not assume what this\nobjection does, namely that meeting needs is an all or nothing affair,\nso that either needs have normative force (in which case they have too\nmuch) or else they can have none at all. \n\nPhilosophers have suggested various ways to identify the needs that\nwarrant normative attention. While there are several common elements\nin these accounts, they also reveal important differences. We review\nhere five of the more prominent accounts in the philosophical\nliterature on needs. \n\nHarry Frankfurt (1984) asks how needs must be understood if they are\nto have the special moral significance that we attribute to them\nrelative to mere desires. He argues that we must distinguish between\nfree volitional needs, where an item is needed only to satisfy a\ndesire over which a person has control—he could choose not to\nhave it; constrained volitional needs, where an item is needed to\nsatisfy a desire a person cannot rid himself of, such as an\naddiction; and non-volitional needs that are entirely independent of\ndesires, such as a sick person’s need for medicine. Only in the\ncase of the latter two categories of need will a person be harmed by\nbeing denied what she needs, Frankfurt argues, and it is only these\nneeds that have the special moral force that the language of\n‘need’ is usually understood to convey. \n\nHarm arising from factors beyond one’s control is also central\nto why needs matter, when they do, on David Wiggins’s account\n(1987, 1998). Wiggins develops these ideas and introduces various\nterms to reflect central features of the concept. There is the gravity\nof the harm that would ensue if the need is not met\n(‘badness’), which is different from the\nurgency to prevent harm from ensuing. Needs may be\nentrenched when they are inflexible to modification, or\nsubstitutable when they are not. A need is basic if\nit results from a law of nature, an unalterable and invariable\nenvironmental fact, or a fact about human constitution. Using this\nterminology, Wiggins defines vital needs as ones that are bad in a way\nthat is entrenched and scarcely substitutable, and it is these vital\nneeds that matter morally according to him. \n\nDavid Braybrooke (1987) develops an account of basic needs that\nconnects needs to social functioning. For Braybrooke something is a\nbasic need if, without its satisfaction, one would be unable to carry\nout four basic social roles, namely, those of citizen, parent,\nhouseholder, and worker. By reflecting on what is needed to have the\ngenuine choice to adopt the role or carry out tasks associated with\nit, we can arrive at a list of needs. To assist in this process he\nalso examines several proposed lists and extracts many common elements\nthat, over the course of a life, are necessary for the four roles he\nidentifies as important. Focusing on what humans typically do (through\nconsideration of these roles) provides Braybrooke with a good\nreference point for compiling this list. The needs that make the list\nare the need for a life-supporting relation to the environment; for\nwhatever is indispensable to preserving the body intact in important\nrespects (including food, water, exercise, and periodic rest); for\ncompanionship; for education; for social acceptance and recognition;\nfor sexual activity; for recreation; and for freedom from harassment,\nincluding not being continually frightened. \n\nLen Doyal and Ian Gough (1991) offer a highly influential account that\naims to connect philosophical and empirical disciplines. On their\nview, needs are universalizable preconditions that enable non-impaired\nparticipation in any form of life. Physical health and autonomy (by\nwhich they mean the mental competence to deliberate and choose) are\nthe two basic needs. An additional class of intermediate needs connect\nthese two basic needs with social science knowledge that can be useful\nin measuring needs fulfilment. The intermediate needs are nutritious\nfood and clean water, protective housing, a non-hazardous work\nenvironment, a non-hazardous physical environment, appropriate health\ncare, security in childhood, significant primary relationships,\nphysical security, economic security, appropriate education, safe\nbirth control, and safe child-bearing. Armed with these intermediate\nneeds they drill down even further, offering specific ideas about the\nkinds of metrics we should adopt to help gain a sense of whether needs\nare being met. These metrics are also helpful in measuring progress\nwith respect to meeting needs over time. \n\nDavid Miller (1999, ch. 10; 2007, ch. 7) follows Wiggins conceptually\nin defining needs as conditions that must be met if a person is not to\nsuffer harm. But the harm in question is not merely\nphysiological. Instead, on Miller’s view, a person is harmed\nwhen she is unable to live a minimally decent life in the society to\nwhich she belongs. Needs, therefore, cannot be identified without\nreference to the social norms that define the requirements of decency\nin a particular place. Since this will depend on cultural factors\npeculiar to each society, Miller further distinguishes\nbetween basic needs and societal needs, where the\nformer are understood as the conditions required for a decent life\nin any society, and the latter as the larger set of\nrequirements for a decent life in the particular society to which a\nperson belongs. Thus food is a basic need, while literacy is a\nsocietal need in any technologically advanced society. Miller argues\nthat this societal variability does not impugn the objectivity or\nmoral force of need claims. \n\nThere are some important common elements to these and other recent\naccounts of normatively salient needs. The needs that matter morally\nare those that are necessary, indispensable, or inescapable, at least\nwith respect to some important goals such as human functioning in\nsocial groups (Braybrooke 1987, Thomson 1987, Wiggins 1998), our\nability to function as human agents (Copp 1998, Gewirth 1978,\nO’Neill 1998, Shue 1980), or promoting human flourishing (Reader\n2005) especially when we consider the many ways in which human agents\ntypically engage with their social environments. While needs theorists\nare of the view that normatively salient needs must be importantly\nconnected to functioning in social settings, they vary on\nwhether only widely shared needs can have this standing or\nwhether needs that are specific to particular people can have this\nstanding as well. Reader (2007, chs. 4–5) is notable for her\nclaim that there is nothing normatively special about needs that are\nrooted in common human nature, though she adds that while this holds\ntrue in moral philosophy, in political philosophy and policy it is\nunderstandable that widely recognized and entrenched needs should be\nthe focus of attention. \n\nGiven the prominent role that needs appear to play in popular\nconceptions of social justice, it may seem remarkable that they have\nbeen largely sidelined in the theories of distributive justice\ndeveloped by philosophers over the last half century, as this section\nwill demonstrate. It is perhaps not a surprise that libertarian\ntheorists such as Robert Nozick should deny that justice might require\nredistribution on behalf of those in need (Nozick 1974, ch. 8; for a\ncritique see Brock 1995). On such a view, while it might be charitable\nor benevolent to help a person in need, justice is defined in terms of\nthe obligation to respect an individual’s personal and property\nrights, and so need only becomes relevant when a person’s needy\ncondition is the result of a prior rights-violation (say, because they\nhave been robbed of their means of subsistence). \n\nMost liberal philosophers, however, rather than explicitly rejecting\nclaims of need, have chosen instead to subsume them within some\nbroader theory of justice, thereby denying them any special force.\nConsider, for example, utilitarian philosophers who advocate using\noverall welfare, understood either as happiness or as desire\nsatisfaction, as the goal by which proposed policies should be\nevaluated. Needs will feature indirectly in this picture: an\nunfulfilled need is likely to be a source of pain or frustration, a\nfulfilled need a source of satisfaction. But there is no reason of\nprinciple to discriminate between, for example, a need and a strong\ndesire. As we saw in section 2.2.1, Griffin (1986) uses the example of\nscholars preferring to build a library extension in place of a gym to\nillustrate the error in supposing that needs should always trump\nwell-informed wants. From a welfarist perspective, there is nothing\nspecial about meeting claims of need. \n\nJohn Rawls’s theory of justice is often presented as a\ncorrective to the deficiencies of utilitarianism. But like his\nutilitarian rivals, Rawls pays no specific attention to needs. In the\nfirst full presentation of his theory, what Rawls refers to as\n‘the precept of need’ is given one paragraph in a book of\n600 pages (Rawls 1971, 276–77). The reason for this neglect\nis fairly clear. According to Rawls, social justice concerns the\ndistribution of ‘primary goods’—listed as\n‘rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, income and\nwealth’—and he assesses that distribution by looking at\nhow representative individuals occupying different social positions,\nlike unskilled worker, fare. So the need claims of particular\nindividuals, such as those with disabilities or special health care\nrequirements, never enter the picture (see further Sen 1980).  Rawls\nspeaks of needs only when discussing the transfer branch of\ngovernment, which is supposed to correct the market distribution of\nincome and wealth by giving resources to those who are worst off\neconomically. In other words, need-based claims for income are\nsubsumed under the general principle of controlling inequalities so as\nto maximise the living standard of the least advantaged\ngroup—the so-called ‘difference principle’ (Rawls\n1971, § 12–13). Rawls mentions in passing a different kind\nof justice that concerns the allocation of goods to particular\npersons, but at this stage he simply excludes it from his theory as a\npotentially misleading distraction (Rawls 1971, 88–89). \n\nIn his later presentation of the theory (Rawls 2001), Rawls tried to\nrespond to the charge that he had overlooked one important dimension\nof social justice by failing to notice how citizens who had the same\nshare of primary goods might nonetheless have very different\nindividual needs (for this criticism, see especially Sen 1980, 1992,\nch. 5). He did so by arguing that access to medical care,\nspecifically, should be regarded as one component of the basic bundle\nof goods whose size the difference principle aimed to maximise (Rawls\n2001, § 51).  Each citizen could anticipate that over the course\nof her lifetime she could expect to require some medical treatment,\nand so access to health care should be factored into the calculation\nof her life prospects. Rawls did not, however, have anything more\nspecific to say about justice in health care—for instance about\nwho among the needy had the strongest claims to be treated—nor\nabout needs of other kinds, nor about the position of people with\nserious disabilities who could not aspire to be ‘fully\nco-operating members of society’. Thus arguably the most\ninfluential theory of social justice to have appeared in the last\nhalf-century virtually eliminated need as an independent criterion of\ndistribution. \n\nConsider next Ronald Dworkin’s ‘equality of\nresources’ view (Dworkin 1981). This might appear to give more\nscope to needs than Rawls’s theory by virtue of the fact that it\nregards personal capacities and incapacities as among the resources\nthat a theory of justice must take into account. Thus insofar as need\ncan be represented as an internal resource deficiency, we might expect\nDworkin to count it as a feature that may entitle its bearer to\nreceive additional resources by way of compensation. And he does\nindeed devote some attention both to the issue of people with\nhandicaps and to the issue of health care in Dworkin 2000 (especially\nchs 2 and 8). He tackles this problem through the device of\nhypothetical insurance: to illustrate this in the case of medical\nneeds, in order to decide what provision a state should make for\nhealth care—how much it should spend and what priorities it\nshould adopt when resources are scarce—we should ask what health\ncare insurance people would buy in advance if they did not know what\ntheir own medical needs would turn out to be. Since this is likely to\nvary from one person to the next, depending on how averse they are to\nparticular risks, Dworkin has to stipulate that what justice requires\nthe state to provide is the level of coverage that most people would\nchoose to buy under these conditions. In reaching a decision, people\nwould be expected to trade off buying different levels of insurance\nagainst other ways of using their money. So again this is a case in\nwhich need considerations get subsumed under a wider principle, in\nthis case compensating people for disadvantages which they would have\ninsured against suffering in advance. Need claims aren’t allowed\nto have independent force. Dworkin’s answer to the question\n‘is satisfying this particular need a matter of justice?’\nis ‘it depends on whether people generally would have chosen to\npurchase insurance against the chance of having it’. The same\nprinciple is applied to other misfortunes, such as the chance of\nbecoming unemployed. \n\nFinally here, consider so-called luck egalitarian theories of\ndistributive justice (see, for example, Temkin 1993; Knight 2009;\nCohen 2011, Part 1; Knight and Stemplowska 2011; Tan 2012). These hold\nthat no-one should be worse off than anyone else unless they are\nresponsible for being worse-off, for example by developing expensive\ntastes or gambling away their resources. Conversely, inequalities that\ncan be attributed to brute luck—such as a storm that demolishes\nmy house but not yours—should be compensated for by\nredistribution from the lucky to the unlucky. At first sight, it looks\nas though this principle will be sensitive to variations in need:\nbeing prone to disease or requiring more calories than average to stay\nhealthy look like exactly the kind of involuntary misfortunes that\nluck egalitarians will seek to rectify via resource transfers. But\nnotice that special needs of this sort are treated no differently from\nother sources of disadvantage, like having meagre talents or being\nborn into a poor family. Luck egalitarians use an undiscriminating,\nand often ill-defined, currency of advantage/disadvantage that can\nrespond to the fact that some people are needier than others, but\nwithout giving those differences any special weight. Notice also that\na luck egalitarian will distinguish between needs that a person has as\na result of her innate bodily features or of accidents that befall\nher, and needs that she has as a result of lifestyle or other choices\nfor which she is personally responsible, and will mandate that she be\ncompensated only for having special needs in the first category. This\nhas led critics such as Anderson (1999) to accuse the doctrine of\nharshness for abandoning negligent victims and discriminating among\nthe disabled according to the source of their disability. For luck\negalitarians, justice doesn’t require that we should respond to\npeople’s needs regardless of how they have arisen. \n\nFor those who believe that claims of need can also be claims of\njustice, the idea that what justice requires is that resources should\nbe distributed according to need has an obvious appeal: the\nneedier someone is, the more resources they should be assigned.  Marx\nfamously wrote that in the higher state of communist society, resource\ndistribution would be governed by the principle ‘from each\naccording to his ability, to each according to his needs’ (Marx\n1977, 569). But he prefaced this by pointing out that this could\nonly happen once ‘the productive forces have also increased with\nthe all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of\nco-operative wealth flow more abundantly’—that is to say,\nscarcity had been overcome. Because of this assumption, it is arguable\nwhether the principle as proposed by Marx should be seen as a\nprinciple of justice, or as a principle for a world that has moved\nbeyond the circumstances for justice (see Buchanan 1982; Lukes 1985,\nch.4; Wood 1980). \n\nUnder conditions of abundance, it is perfectly clear what distribution\naccording to need entails: everyone should receive the resources that\nare required to fulfil all of their needs. The much more difficult\nquestion is to provide an interpretation of the principle under\nconditions of scarcity where needs cannot be met in full (for longer\ndiscussions, see Miller 1999, ch. 10 and Miller, forthcoming). We can\nthink of each person as having a need-based claim which is measured by\nthe size of the gap between what she now has, and what she would have\nto be given to meet her need in full. For example, if for a healthy\nlife a woman needs food that provides 2000 kilocalories per day, but\nthe amount of food now available to her only provides 1500, then her\nclaim is for additional food that provides 500 kilocalories. It might\nthen seem that to distribute according to need means to distribute in\nproportion to the size of claims: the person whose claim is 1000 kcal\nshould receive twice as much food as the person whose claim is\n500. This models distribution according to need on distribution\naccording to (comparative) desert, where a proportionality principle\nis generally thought to be the appropriate one to use. But in the case\nof needs, there are two objections to this solution. \n\nFirst, there is no general reason to think that people will be equally\neffective in converting need-satisfying resources into satisfied\nneeds. This will depend, for example, on the body’s capacity to\nmetabolize food or medicine. So a distribution of resources that is\nproportionate to initial need claims won’t necessarily bring\nabout a proportionate decrease in those claims. Second, even if\nconversion rates are the same, applying the proportionality principle\nwill still leave those with larger initial claims worse off. For\nexample, suppose we only have enough food to supply 600 kcal of energy\nto the two people in the previous paragraph. Using the proportionality\nprinciple, we award 400 kcal to the first person and 200 kcal to the\nsecond. But the outcome is that the first person is left with an\nunsatisfied claim for 600 kcal and the second for only 300\nkcal. Intuitively, this is not what it means to attend to their needs\nfairly. \n\nThis suggests an alternative principle: distribute in whatever way\nleaves people at the end of the distribution with unsatisfied claims\nthat are as nearly equal in size as possible. In the example given,\nthat would mean aiming for an outcome in which each person falls 450\nkcal short of a fully adequate diet. But this too faces\nobjections. One is that it may look implausible in cases where some\npeople are very poor at converting resources into\nneed-satisfaction. Suppose, for example, we have to allocate medical\nresources between a number of people some of whom are very ill but\nwhose condition can be improved only slightly by the resources we\nhave. The equal outcome principle may entail devoting all of the\navailable resources to those people, and this may seem unfair to those\nwho otherwise could be helped much more. The principle in its\nunqualified form might also recommend levelling down—i.e.,\nwithholding resources from people where supplying them would have the\neffect of increasing final inequality in need-satisfaction. \n\nIn complete contrast, distribution according to need could be\ninterpreted to mean minimising unmet need, in other words satisfying\nneed claims to the greatest possible extent overall. This, however,\nseems more like a principle of efficiency than a principle of\njustice. As such, it is vulnerable to the objection that it\ndoesn’t take seriously the separateness of persons. It is likely\nto require consistently favouring those who are best at converting\nresources into need-satisfaction, and conversely it may recommend\ndoing nothing for people who have large need claims but whose\nsituation is such that it can only materially be improved by deploying\na lot of resources. Once again this seems intuitively unfair. \n\nIt follows that to assess what someone is due under a needs-based\nprinciple of distribution, we will have to take into account at least\nthe following three factors: how large their claim is in absolute\nterms; how large their claim is compared with the claims of others in\nthe relevant group; and how capable they are of converting resources\ninto diminished levels of need. This raises the question whether there\nis any single principle of distribution that is sensitive to each of\nthese factors. One principle that might appear to be is the weighted\npriority principle defended, for example, in Crisp 2002.  Whereas a\nstrict priority principle tells us always to begin by attending to\nthose with the largest need claims—and therefore fall foul of\nthe problem noted above, of paying no attention to relative capacity\nto benefit, so that it may instruct us to focus exclusively on\nbringing about small improvements in the condition of the most\nneedy—a weighted priority principle works differently. It\ncalculates gains by multiplying reductions in needs score by a factor\nthat reflects the absolute starting position of the person in\nquestion. So if we return to the simple case where one person needs\n1000 kcals and another 500 kcals, and use an arithmetic weighting\nfactor, then we would count reducing the first person’s level of\nneed to 800 kcals as equivalent to reducing the second person’s\nlevel of need to 400. The needier person’s gain is treated as\ntwice as significant as the less needy person’s. \n\nBut this principle too has implications that in some cases seem\ncounterintuitive. One is that, despite the tilt in favour of the\nneediest, there are going to be cases in which it advocates helping a\nlarge number of less needy people instead. If enough people can have\nminor headaches relieved at the cost of denying someone a kidney\ntransplant, the principle will advocate doing that. Crisp responds to\nthis problem by introducing a needs threshold such that those with\nrelatively trivial needs are excluded at the first stage of\nimplementation and only come into consideration if there are surplus\nresources after the weighted priority principle is applied to those\nabove the threshold. But, as he himself puts it, ‘where the\nthreshold falls, of course, is the key question any proponent of this\nview must answer’ (Crisp 2002, 140). \n\nAnother problem with the weighted priority view is that it pays no\ndirect attention to horizontal fairness between people, in the\nfollowing sense: we think that if two people begin in the same\ncondition of need—say they have sustained similar\ninjuries—there is value in their receiving treatment that gives\nthem the same outcome, so long as this is feasible and not excessively\ncostly. But the weighted priority principle cannot ensure this, since\nit has a bias in favour of the victim who can be treated at lesser\ncost; by choosing to treat that person rather than the equally needy\nother, more needs overall can be satisfied. So although there might be\nexceptional cases in which we are willing to practice a form of\ntriage, because we can see that treating John’s needs will have\nopportunity costs that are simply too high, the weighted priority\nprinciple risks taking us too far in that direction. \n\nA variant on the weighted priority view has been proposed by Hassoun\nin the form of her ‘effectiveness principle’, defined as\nfollows: \n\nFirst, rank the possible policies from best to worst according to how\nmuch weighted need they alleviate. Second, rank the possible policies\nfrom best to worst according to the number of people they help. Third,\nfor each policy, combine its ranking in terms of how much weighted\nneed it alleviates with its ranking for how many people it helps to\nyield its final score (Hassoun 2009, 259–60). \n\nThe new element introduced by Hassoun here is the idea that needs\npolicies are better to the extent that they help more people rather\nthan fewer even if the overall improvement in (weighted)\nneed-satisfaction remains the same. Of course this would be liable to\nmake matters worse in the kind of case that worries Crisp. Where the\nweighted priority principle can be faulted for allowing many\nrelatively minor need claims to outweigh the more serious claims of a\nfew badly-off people, adding in a component that gives credit simply\nfor the number of people who are aided only adds to the\nproblem. Nonetheless, it is worth asking whether the justice of an\nallocation should be sensitive to the sheer number of people whose\nneeds are met. \n\nOne reason for thinking so might be that it always shows respect for a\nperson to attend practically to their needs, even if only in a small\nway. So the more people who are treated when an allocation is\nperformed, the more recognition is extended to those in need. The\nchallenge, however, is to understand why sufficient respect is not\nbeing shown when everyone’s claims are properly\nconsidered by whoever is performing an allocation, even if the\nend result is that some people get nothing because whatever claim they\nmight have is justifiably outweighed by the stronger claims of other\npeople. So one might question whether the numbers being aided has\nthe deeper significance that Hassoun’s effectiveness principle\nimplies, as opposed merely to providing evidence that no-one’s\nclaim has been overlooked. \n\nThe upshot of this discussion is that in conditions of scarcity, there\nis no uniquely defensible way of spelling out the principle of\ndistribution according to need. We face conflicting imperatives: to\nmeet as many needs as possible, taking into account how much each\ncosts to satisfy, and to preserve comparative justice by ensuring that\npeople whose needs are similar are treated in the same way. This can\nbe presented as a trade-off between efficiency and justice, but since\nas noted earlier we are often required to meet needs as a matter of\njustice, it can also be seen as a clash between non-comparative and\ncomparative justice. \n\nNeeds have long played a role as guides to public policy, not only\ndomestically but also internationally, where the so-called Basic Needs\nApproach to global poverty and international development became\ndominant in the 1970s and early 1980s. More recently, however, it has\nbeen displaced by the ‘capabilities approach’ developed\nespecially by Amartya Sen and implemented in policy instruments such\nas the UN’s Human Development Index. Sen (1984) argued that the\nbasic needs approach was too narrow for these purposes, as well as\nbeing defective for a number of other reasons, and should therefore be\nsubsumed within his capabilities approach. In this section we review\nthe arguments for and against replacing needs with capabilities as a\ntool of policy evaluation (see also Reader 2006). For a much fuller\ndiscussion of capabilities themselves,\n see the entry on\n the capability approach.\n  \n\nThe capability approach provides a way of measuring a person’s\nlevel of well-being. It combines two elements:\n‘functionings’, that is the various activities that a\nperson performs or states that they achieve, and\n‘capabilities’, that is the option of realizing\nfunctionings if one so chooses. Thus ‘being adequately\nnourished’ and ‘working as a computer programmer’\nare examples of functionings, whereas ‘having the choice to be\nadequately nourished’ and ‘having the option to work as a\ncomputer programmer’ are examples of capabilities. The approach\nplaces most emphasis on capabilities out of a concern for freedom of\nchoice. A concern for functionings alone, it is argued, might justify\nforcing people to behave in certain ways (eat healthy food, for\nexample). A person’s well-being is then measured by the size of\nher capability set: the more capabilities she has, the better off she\nis judged to be. \n\nAs will immediately be clear, capabilities capture many more aspects\nof human well-being than do needs, and this is claimed to be an\nadvantage of the approach. But it comes with a corresponding\ndisadvantage, namely that capabilities lack the normative force that\nneeds possess. Some capabilities (like the option of being adequately\nnourished) are morally important, while others (like the option to buy\na fancy sports car) are trivial. So whereas a person’s being in\nneed always counts as a strong pro tanto reason to aid them,\na person’s lacking a capability may be of no moral concern at\nall. \n\nIn response to this problem, Sen has introduced the idea of\n‘basic capabilities’, understood as ‘the ability to\nsatisfy certain elementary and crucially important functionings up to\ncertain levels’ (Sen 1992, 45), for use in definitions of global\npoverty. In this case the basic needs approach and the capabilities\napproach will converge, since identifying these ‘crucially\nimportant functionings’ will involve the same exercise as\nidentifying universal human needs, namely establishing what is\nnecessary for human beings to enjoy a minimally decent life.  It is a\nmistake, therefore, to imagine that by switching from needs to\ncapabilities one can avoid the difficult semi-empirical task of\nestablishing what conditions are essential to human beings if they are\nto avoid being harmed. \n\nCapability theorists, including Sen, have levelled a number of\ncriticisms against the basic needs approach. One is that the approach\nis excessively commodity-focused. However, this criticism does not\nseem to be appropriate if we look at either the original or subsequent\ndefenders of needs as a policy tool for international development\n(though perhaps the complaint has more traction if targeted at the\nimplementation priorities of the time). The original defenders often\nincluded non-material needs, such as employment (Streeten 1981;\nStewart 1985). More generally, there is no reason to assume that only\ncommodities are relevant need satisfiers, and this is obvious when we\nlook at how needs theorists develop their accounts (see further Reader\n2006). Consider Braybrooke (1987) as one prominent example: his list\nincludes such important items as the need for a life-supporting\nrelation to the environment, for social acceptance and recognition,\nfor freedom from harassment, and for companionship. Indeed, reflecting\non the whole list, we notice that while commodities might be relevant\nto satisfying some of these needs, they are not relevant to (or only a\nvery small part of) fulfilling most of the items on his list. \n\nA second charge levelled by Sen is that ‘a concentration on just\nthe minimum requirements may lead to a softening of the opposition to\ninequality in general’ (Sen 1984, 515). This draws attention to\nthe fact that needs define a standard of sufficiency (see Frankfurt\n2015) and cannot be appealed to directly to determine how any\navailable surplus resources above that line should be allocated.\nHowever the point should not be overstated. In today’s world,\nreducing inequality by redistribution from rich to poor may be a\nnecessary precondition for meeting everyone’s basic needs.\nMoreover if we widen the focus to consider needs that arise in\nparticular societies, we will often find that needs and inequality\ninteract, since what is essential for a minimally decent life will\ndepend in part on the general standard of living in the society in\nquestion. It is for this reason that poverty is often defined in\nrelative terms, as having an income below a certain percentage of the\nsocial median. \n\nFinally, the most prominent claim made on behalf of the capability\napproach is that, unlike a needs-based approach, it puts front and\ncenter the values of choice and participation (Alkire 2002 and\n2005). There are several responses available to this objection. First,\nthe charge assumes that the recipients of needs-meeting policy will\nnot have their choices respected and, more generally, will not\nparticipate in activities aimed at meeting their needs. However we\nmight think that providing options for enabling people to meet their\nneeds, while leaving final choices to them as to whether they avail\nthemselves of those options, is all that plausible needs-directed\npolicy requires. There is plenty of scope for respecting choices \nconsistently with providing such options. Second, capability\ntheorists can be accused of a kind of “freedom fetishism”\nby overstating the importance of freedom of choice in many cases. Here\nwe might draw attention to the important problem of adaptive\npreferences which might lead people to fail to seize opportunities\nthat would otherwise allow them to meet their needs. In these\ncircumstances, less weight should be attached to people’s\nchoices or their expressed views about these choices. Indeed\ncapability theorists themselves recognize the force of this point\ninsofar as they include achieved functionings alongside capabilities\nin their overall metric of personal well-being. In some cases it is\nthe functioning itself, rather than the capability, that matters: if\nour task is to supply drinkable water to a village that up to now has\nlacked it, there is no reason to leave the old polluted well open so\nthat the villagers have the capacity to choose between clean and\nunclean water. Providing clean water is all that should concern\nus. \n\nFor much of this entry we have been considering needs in a societal\ncontext and have focused on needs-related responsibilities to\ncurrently existing members of our society. But questions about\nresponsibilities in connection with needs are certainly not confined\nto this context. Are nonhuman animals’ needs normatively\nsalient, and if so, how should they be weighed against human needs?\nShould the needs of future generations bear on current decisions\nconcerning distributing according to need? How should the grave and\nurgent needs of those in low-income countries condition\nresponsibilities to meet less dire needs of compatriots? These kinds\nof questions raise a huge range of further issues that we cannot\ndiscuss here. Fortunately, there are several entries in this\nEncyclopedia that discuss such questions and several of these are\nlisted in the section on Related Entries below. For more on the first\nquestion\n see \n moral status of animals.\n For more on the second issue see\n intergenerational justice.\n For more on the third topic see\n global justice\n and\n international distributive justice.\n ","contact.mail":"g.brock@auckland.ac.nz","contact.domain":"auckland.ac.nz"},{"date.published":"2019-04-11","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/needs/","author1":"Gillian Brock","author1.info":"http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/people/gbro064","author2.info":"https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/david-miller/","entry":"needs","body.text":"\n\n\n\nMuch ordinary discourse about political and moral matters invokes the\nlanguage of needs. In such contexts claims about need are often\nthought to carry significant weight. By contrast, the role that needs\nshould play in normative reasoning is contested among philosophers. In\nthis article we discuss several core issues concerning needs in\ncontemporary moral and political philosophy. We begin by discussing\nthe normativity of needs and some of the disputes concerning the\nsignificance of needs claims.\n\n\n\nWe then canvass some reasons to be skeptical about needs and their\nability to do any useful work in moral and political philosophy.\nThese include skepticism about the objectivity of needs and therefore\nconcerns about whether needs claims can ground relevant obligations.\nSome also maintain that distribution according to need is undesirable,\nfor instance because it is essentially paternalistic, or because it\ncan result in being confronted with an overly burdensome and possibly\nendless series of demands. In response to such potential problems we\ndiscuss widely used strategies for disarming the main forms of\nskepticism and evaluate their success. \n\n\n\nOn the face of it, human beings can claim to have a wide variety of\nneeds. Which needs warrant normative attention? We discuss some\ninfluential recent accounts of the needs that matter morally, along\nwith the arguments offered for why those needs are special. Here we\ndiscuss influential work by Harry Frankfurt, David Braybrooke, David\nWiggins, David Miller, Len Doyal, and Ian Gough. While there are\nseveral common elements to these accounts, there are also important\ndifferences.\n\n\n\nWe then discuss needs in recent theories of distributive\njustice. Given the role needs seem to play in popular discourse about\nsocial justice it may seem odd that needs have largely been ignored by\ncontemporary theorists concerned with distributive justice. But by\nmeans of a wide trawl through the dominant theories, we show that this\nis indeed the case. We offer some explanations for this apparently odd\nphenomenon.\n\n\n\nMarx is well known for maintaining that a communist society would\naspire to distribute resources according to the principle “from\neach according to his ability, to each according to his needs”\n(Marx 1977, 569). What would distribution according to need entail?\nWe outline several possibilities, showing strengths and weaknesses\nwith each interpretation. However, as we highlight, there is no\nuniquely defensible or best way of understanding what the principle of\ndistribution according to need requires in all cases.\n\n\n\nA needs-based approach played an important role in global public\npolicy, especially concerning addressing poverty and human\ndevelopment, in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, the capabilities\napproach replaced it in the late 1980s. Policy-makers appeared to lose\nconfidence in a needs-based approach and capabilities were considered\nby many of the most influential decision-makers to offer a more\nsophisticated conceptual framework. We review some of the arguments on\nboth sides of this debate, discussing their strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\n\n\nIn our final section we identify some ways in which concern with needs\nextends to several contemporary debates, such as those concerning the\nscope and content of justice. What constraints do the needs of others\nwho are not proximate (either geographically or temporally) place on\nfair distributions within states, for instance? We note where more\nextended treatment of these concerns occurs in several other articles\nin this encyclopedia.\n\n\nThe role that needs should play in our practical reasoning is a hotly\ncontested topic. On one side stand philosophers who argue that the\nneeds of others always impose moral demands on us, or more strongly\nstill that the very idea of moral obligation cannot be understood\nexcept with reference to needs (see Reader 2007, chs. 4–5; Weil\n1952, 3–9). They are also likely to believe that meeting\nneeds should be a primary aim of public policy. On the other side\nstand philosophers who argue that needs are a false currency; they\nappear to be both objective and fundamental, but in fact are neither,\nsince claims of need always make tacit reference to some further end\nfor which the thing claimed is necessary (Barry 1965, 47–9;\nFlew 1981, ch. 5; White 1975, ch. 8). Moreover in politics, appeals to\nneed are not only misleading, but dangerous, because the obligations\nthey apparently impose can serve to justify indefinitely expanding the\nscope of government at the expense of individual freedom (Minogue\n1963, ch. 4). \n\nHow should we respond to this contest? It is tempting to sidestep the\ncontroversy over needs by substituting other concepts that cover some\nof the same terrain but are viewed as less contestable—such as\nresources, welfare, or capabilities—and as we shall see later,\nneeds have played a smaller part than one might expect in recent\npolitical philosophy. Yet there remains something compelling about the\nidea of need. To say that a human being is in need—is ill, or\nstarving, or threatened by danger—seems on the face of it to\nidentify a state of affairs that calls for immediate remedy. In\neveryday life, the language of need is pervasive. We talk constantly\nof the needs of children, the elderly, the poor, the sick, the lonely,\nand so on. We should not be too quick, therefore, to assume that\nneeds-talk can easily be replaced by some other idiom. Instead we\nshould try to understand how the controversy has arisen, and whether\nit can be resolved by more careful specification of the needs claims\nthat have non-derivative practical force. \n\nA good place to start is with the question whether claims of the form\n‘\\(A\\) needs \\(X\\)’ are always elliptical, that is whether\nthey are always opaque unless filled out by supplying the end, \\(Y\\),\nfor which \\(X\\) is needed. Clearly many need statements have that\nproperty. If I say ‘Mary needs a hat’, then unless the\ncontext makes it clear already, it is apposite to ask ‘What does\nshe need the hat for?’ to which the answer might be ‘To\navoid getting sunburnt’. Yet other need claims seem not to be\nelliptical in that way. If I say ‘the baby needs its diaper\nchanged’, it would be more than a little bizarre to ask\n‘what for?’. Although it would no doubt be possible\nformally to expand the sentence by specifying a goal, no fresh\ninformation would be supplied to anyone who already knew what a baby\nwas and what a diaper was, whereas in the case of Mary’s hat,\nthe reference to sunburn does genuine explanatory work by displacing\nother reasons that Mary might have for needing suitable headgear. \n\nIt matters whether or not all need statements are elliptical because\nthis is connected to the further question whether need claims can have\nindependent justificatory force. For those who deny this, such as\nBarry, the fact that need claims always require spelling out in the\nform ‘\\(A\\) needs \\(X\\) in order to \\(Y\\)’ shows that what\nmatters normatively are always the \\(Y\\) items, the ends for which the\nthings needed are necessary. Barry concedes that there are\n‘core’ cases of human need where the context makes it\nclear that the ends being invoked fall within a narrow range (health,\nfor instance), yet concludes that ‘this modification does not\naffect my thesis that no special account has to be taken of\n“need”, for it is still derivative and the only\ninteresting questions arise in connection with the ends’ (Barry\n1965, 49). \n\nOthers, however, deny this. For Wiggins, the problem with the claim\nthat all need claims are elliptical is that it blurs the distinction\nbetween the instrumental sense of ‘need’, where the\npurpose for which the claimed item is needed might be almost anything,\nand the categorical sense where ‘the purpose is already fixed,\nand fixed by virtue of the meaning of the word’ (Wiggins 1998,\n9). In the case of categorical needs, needed items are things that\nhuman beings must have to avoid being harmed, but it is a mistake to\nsee ‘avoidance of harm’ as a further end that explains why\nthe need is a need; instead it is already present in the idea of need\nitself. A similar argument is made by Thomson (1987), though using a\ndifferent vocabulary of derivative and basic needs. Of course these\nanalyses of the concept of need do not yet tell us what our\ncategorical or basic needs are. It is uncontroversial to say that the\nresources without which a human being could not survive, such as food\nand water, count as needs. But how far beyond this does the concept\nstretch? Could needs that only some people have count as categorical,\nfor example? We return to this question in section 3 below when we\ndiscuss different substantive theories of need. \n\nConsider next the alleged normative force of need claims. They are\noften singled out for discussion because on the one hand whether\nsomebody has a need seems to be a matter of fact, while on the other\nthe existence of the need once established seems to constitute a\nreason for acting so as to fulfil it. If John, who has a migraine,\nneeds a painkiller (matter of fact), then I have a reason to give him\none (normative reason). So needs serve as a bridge between\n‘is’ and ‘ought’. Yet leaving aside general\ndoubts as to whether such bridge-building is possible, we need to\ntread cautiously here. First, the thesis is only plausible in the case\nof categorical needs. In the case of instrumental needs, everything\nwill turn on the end for which the needed item is required. An\narsonist may need a match to start a fire, but there is no reason to\nhand him one. Second, even categorical needs only provide reasons for\naction when the need is presently unfulfilled. So we need to draw a\ndistinction between ‘occurrent’ and\n‘dispositional’ needs (Thomson 1987, 11–12;\nReader 2007, 71). A dispositional need is a general need that human\nbeings have, like the need for sleep. But whether a person has an\noccurrent need for sleep depends on whether he has just woken up after\na good night’s rest or on the contrary has been unable to sleep\nfor the last twenty-four hours. It is only in the latter case, where\nthe need is occurrent, that others have a reason to meet it by\noffering the sleep-deprived person a bed to lie on. \n\nWhat kinds of reason for action do basic needs create? Needs are\nsometimes described as ‘morally demanding’, and therefore\nas directly generating moral obligations on the part of those who can\nfulfil them (Reader 2007, chs. 4–6). But what kind of\nobligation? Some philosophers writing in defence of care ethics take\nresponding to need as the paradigm case of, or even definitive of, a\ncaring relationship. For Bubeck, for example, ‘caring for is the\nmeeting of the needs of one person by another person where\nface-to-face interaction between carer and cared for is a crucial\nelement of the overall activity and where the need is of such a nature\nthat it cannot possibly be met by the person in need herself’\n(Bubeck 1995, 129). This is echoed by Held (2006, 10):\n‘the central focus of the ethics of care is on the compelling\nmoral salience of attending to and meeting the needs of the particular\nothers for whom we take responsibility’. However it would be a\nmistake to think that needs only have moral relevance in the context\nof caring relationships, even if it is within those relationships that\nthey can be responded to most fully. For meeting needs is also\nsometimes demanded as a matter of justice: we explore the relationship\nbetween needs and justice more fully in section 4 below. We can see\nthis most clearly in circumstances where resources are not plentiful\nenough to meet everyone’s needs in full. Then we face the\nproblem of how to distribute them, and the principle we use to solve\nit will be a principle of justice.  ‘To each according to their\nneeds’ has over the last two centuries often been held up as the\nhighest principle of distributive justice, although as we shall see in\nsection 5 there are a number of different ways in which the\nrequirement to distribute scarce resources\naccording to need can be interpreted. Those who want to\ndefend the supremacy of care as a moral value acknowledge that justice\nof this kind must have a place within caring relationships (Held 2006,\nch. 4). The caring parent, for instance, must pay equal attention\nto the various different needs of each of his or her children. \n\nWhere a caring relationship already exists, it is easy to identify the\nperson who has the moral obligation to meet another’s needs, but\nthis raises the question whether needs as such can impose obligations\non those who have the means to satisfy them, or whether there must\nalready be a pre-existing relationship that explains why Alfred has an\nobligation to meet Betty’s needs. Reader (2007, 72) defends\nthe view that ‘need only constitutes an actual moral demand in\nthe context of a moral relationship’. But she is obliged to\nstretch the idea of a moral relationship to deal with emergency\nsituations in which we intuitively think that rescuers are obliged to\ncome to the aid of complete strangers when they can do so at little\ncost. She does so by arguing that ‘encounters’, even very\nbrief ones, should count as a form of moral relationship (Reader 2007,\n 74–5). This, however, is implausible if it is intended to\ninclude cases such as those in which the person in need is unaware of\nthe presence of her saviour (for example because she is lying\nunconscious). The relationship between rescuer and victim here\nconsists simply in the former’s physical capacity to carry out\nthe rescue at small cost: there is no person-to-person encounter\nbetween them prior to the rescue itself. So if we think that the\nrescuer in such cases does have an obligation to meet the needs of the\nvictim, then we must concede that human need alone can impose\nobligations in the absence of any further relationship between the two\nparties. \n\nA more nuanced view here would hold that it is only cases of extreme\nneed—where life itself or serious bodily harm is at\nstake—that can create such obligations between perfect\nstrangers. Where needs are less severe—for example our\npsychological needs for love or moral support—the obligation to\nmeet them falls only on those already connected to the person in\nneed. There is a parallel here to the debate in political morality\nabout the obligations of states to meet the needs of those inside and\noutside their borders, respectively. One view is that states are\nrequired to meet a quite extensive set of needs on the part of their\nown citizens (including, for example, needs for elaborate and\nexpensive forms of medical treatment), whereas their obligations to\noutsiders are more limited, and confined to cases such as famine or\nepidemic where lives are at risk. Others would challenge this\ndistinction, and argue that where needs are at stake states have a\nduty to be impartial, so that if state \\(S\\) is for some reason unable\nto meet the extensive needs of its own citizens, other states have a\n duty to step in and fill the gap (See \n global justice). \n\nMany kinds of concerns have been raised about needs playing an\nimportant role in moral and political philosophy. We might divide\nthese into two main categories. The first category focuses on whether\nor not we can identify clear criteria for determining needs,\nin particular those needs that are capable of playing such a role.  In\nthe second category the common theme is the inadequacy of need as a\nguide to our moral or political obligations. In the first part of this\nsection we canvass some of these common concerns and in section 2.3\nreview some common response strategies. \n\nFor need to play the fundamental normative role that its advocates\nenvisage, it seems essential that there should be a consensus on what\npeople really need. However, looking around at what people\nclaim to need, we seem to be confronted with diverse,\nsometimes conflicting, possibilities. Consider, for instance, how\nmembers of a Bedouin tribe may claim to need some camels, pita bread,\ngood copies of the Koran, and swords, in order to live a minimally good\nlife. By contrast, so-called Millennials living in New York might claim\nthat good Internet access, technological connectivity, and reliable\nmass transit systems are fundamental to their well-being. The\nconcern here is that we will be unable to derive one robust list of\nneeds that captures this variety, and is applicable to all\npeople. Even if we limit our focus to one particular society we\nwill note that there is still enormous variety in what people claim to\nneed. Some may claim to be unable to enjoy life without music,\nart, long walks in natural habitats, or a large group of like-minded\nfriends. Others might see no value in this list of reported\nessentials. Faced with such claims, how can real needs be\nidentified? \n\nPhilosophers who write about the concept of need are keen to emphasize\nhow needs differ from desires, wants, and preferences: we often want\nthings that we do not need, and equally we may not want what we need\nbecause we fail to recognize its importance to us (all of this seems\nabundantly clear when we observe the eating patterns of many young\nchildren). Since, in general, we only have weak reasons to satisfy\npeople’s desires and preferences, this contrast seems important\nif we want to maintain that meeting claims of need is morally\nobligatory (see e.g. Miller 2014, 20–22). \n\nYet on further reflection we may begin to doubt whether such a\ncategorical separation between needs and wants is feasible.  This\nrelates back to the first set of concerns already mentioned in\n2.1.1. We might observe that some things we once considered to be more\naptly described as preferences, desires or wants have widely come to\nbe thought of as needs. Examples of this phenomenon might include\naccess to computers, the Internet, television sets, refrigeration, and\ncentral heating, which are widely thought of as among the necessities\nof modern life. Given these changes over time concerning what is\nregarded as a need, the suspicion may arise that a need is nothing\nmore than a desire whose satisfaction has become socially expected,\nand therefore lacks the special moral force that its defenders claim\nfor it.  \n\nNeeds as grounds of distribution might be attacked by those who are\nkeen to promote the virtues of self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and\nsocial independence. Rather than demanding of others that they should\nmeet our needs, an objector might maintain that we should transcend\nour neediness, associated as it is with weakness, frailty,\nvulnerability, and other pathetic parts of our nature. Attending to\nneed can be debilitating for both giver and receiver, on this line of\nobjection. On the giver’s part, the demandingness of need is\nfelt to threaten her capacity to carry out her own plan of\nlife. Emerson gave vent to this thought: \n\nDo not tell me, as a good man did today, of my obligation to put all\npoor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee,\nthou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the\ncent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not\nbelong (Emerson 1901, 59). \n\nOn the receiver’s side, being dependent on others to meet our\nneeds renders us subservient to them. Consider Adam Smith’s\nremark: \n\nNothing tends so much to corrupt and enervate and debase the mind as\ndependency, and nothing gives such noble and generous notions of\nprobity as freedom and independence (Smith 1982 (originally\n1762–1763), 333). \n\nFor Smith, commercial exchange in a free market serves to prevent the\nnoted vices. Markets foster self-reliance, social independence, and\nexchange among equals, freeing us from relations of dominance,\nsubservience, and servility. \n\nIn addition, if the state is in the business of attending to\npeople’s needs, this raises the spectre of a bureaucratic, nanny\nstate fostering one-sided dependence among citizens. The idea of\ndistribution according to need, it is said, invokes or lends itself to\na passive conception of agency. Those to whom goods are distributed\nwill be seen as recipients of the state’s largesse. More\nworrisomely, the beneficiaries themselves may come to abandon the\nattempt to meet their own needs, as state policies promote a culture\nof dependence. This is destructive of people’s own sense of\ntheir agency and empowerment, and destructive of the very ethos a good\nsociety should be promoting.  We should instead be encouraging people\nto take responsibility for their own well-being. \n\nCritics argue that using need as a criterion of distribution lends\nitself to paternalism, authoritarianism, or abuse. To ensure parity of\ntreatment, an outside agency must decide what needs different people\nhave. But it may seem instead that people should be allowed the\nfreedom to decide for themselves what their needs are, how they should\nmatter, and what weight should attach to them compared with other\nconsiderations that might subjectively seem more important. Griffin\ngives the example of a group of scholars having to choose between an\nextension to their library and exercise equipment to promote their\nhealth (Griffin 1986, 45). The latter can be construed as a need,\nwhereas the former is only an informed desire, since it depends on\naims that are peculiar to the scholarly community. Yet, Griffin\nargues, it would be odd to say that there is an obligation to provide\nthe equipment that the scholars value less in preference to the\nresource that they value more. As those whose wellbeing is at issue,\nthe scholars should be the ones to make judgements about how to weigh\ntheir needs with other core aspects of their wellbeing.  \n\nIn short, distributing in accordance with needs allows too many\nopportunities for outsiders to get these matters wrong or to act\npaternalistically with regard to those they aim to assist.  It is best\nto have individuals be in charge of managing their needs in the\ncontexts of their own lives. \n\nHere the charge is that, once we think of needs as imposing\nobligations on us, there will be too many for us to satisfy. Some will\nbe especially demanding. Consider how many medical needs are in this\ncategory, such as needs for renal dialysis machines or needs\nassociated with organ transplantation. Even to attempt to meet all of\nthem would be excessively burdensome on those who are required to\nassist, whether as charity donors or taxpayers. \n\nThere are at least two kinds of concerns associated with this\n“bottomless pit” worry. Reflecting, for instance, on the\ncost of meeting medical needs within most high-income countries and\nthe fact that healthcare budgets are under significant pressures (even\nthough reasonably high proportions of public resources are allocated\nto healthcare), it seems that we cannot satisfy all the\nhealthcare needs that present themselves within our societies.  Given\nscientific and technical advances, there will be an indefinitely large\nnumber of possible new treatments to promote the quality of life and\nto prolong it. So since the healthcare budget is finite, and limited\nby competing demands on public funds, it seems that in this area needs\nare in principle insatiable: there will always be more that we might\ndo to fulfil them. \n\nThis in principle insatiability concern can easily transform into an\noverdemandingness concern if we extend the scope of the needs that we\nhave a responsibility to meet to other societies besides our own.\nConsider the vast number of people across the planet who have unmet\nneeds for healthcare alone, never mind all the other domains in which\ntheir needs go unfulfilled. One might easily conclude that if needs\nhave normative force, we will be overwhelmed by the apparent\nbottomless pits of needs that exist globally. \n\nMany philosophers have engaged with these kinds of objections. One\nstrategy frequently used to address concerns related to a lack of\nobjectivity is to argue that what counts as a need, especially one\nthat is to have normative importance, can be decided in principled\nways (e.g. Braybrooke 1987, Doyal and Gough 1991, Wiggins 1987).\nVarious authors delineate the principles differently though there is\nalso important convergence and overlap, as we discuss in section 3\nbelow. A common theme is that the needs that are normatively salient,\nespecially in political distribution, are those that are necessary,\nindispensable, or inescapable, given the kinds of creatures that we\nare and the requirements for functioning in social settings. \n\nAll authors grapple somewhat with the level at which we should specify\nwhat it is people need. While reflection on our common humanity might\nwell be an important source of understanding about what humans need,\nto articulate that more precisely we need to engage with particular\nsocial contexts to flesh out any lists that will apply within\nparticular societies and have purchase in policy matters.  One common\ndistinction in the literature is to differentiate between needs and\ntheir satisfiers. The idea is that we can give a fairly high-level\nstatement of our human needs, but for particular societies we will\noften require a more specific account of what forms the satisfiers could\ntake in those societal contexts. So to illustrate, we might say that\nall people need sufficient health and sufficient protection from\nenvironmental hazards. To specify what that amounts to for members of\nparticular societies, we need to examine threats to health\nin particular environments (along with whatever general ones\nalso apply to all human beings). Consider how prudent precautions for\nInuit will differ from those that are recommended in societies where\nmosquito-borne illnesses are rampant (even if it is also true that a\nnumber of similar precautions apply to both). And this will be the\ncase for all our human needs. Even when we make claims about our human\nneeds, the forms that satisfying those needs may take in particular\nsocieties can admit of huge variation. \n\nSo, differentiating between needs and their satisfiers plays an\nimportant role in explaining some of the diversity we see reflected\naround the world, along with some of the diversity we see within\nsocieties. Consider an intra-societal example. While we all might have\na need for appropriate recreation, the form this takes may well\nvary. For some, recreational needs are satisfied by listening to\nmusic, while for others nothing short of mountain walking will do. So\nwhile some people claim that they couldn’t possibly live without\nmusic, and other say the same about walking in the mountains, what\nthey are disagreeing about is satisfiers rather than basic human\nneeds. They can agree that there is a need for recreation even if they\ndisagree about the form satisfaction of the need should take for\nthem. \n\nAnother distinction that can often account for other examples of\napparent diversity is also worth mentioning. As David Braybrooke\nsuggests, there is a difference between ‘adventitious\nneeds’ and ‘course-of-life’ needs (Braybrooke 1987,\n29). Adventitious needs are those that become important given a\ncertain project, practice, or activity. But within one society not all\ncitizens may wish to undertake those activities. The needs may not be\nshared by all, even if it is true that the item claimed to be needed\nis indeed essential to undertake that activity. By contrast, a\ncourse-of-life need is one that is widely shared and is not dependent\non particular projects; during the course of human lives lived in that\nsociety, one typically needs items on the list. \n\nIn response to the concerns that distribution according to need is\nundesirable because it lends itself to paternalism, authoritarianism,\nundesirable conceptions of agency, or overwhelming demands, a common\napproach is to point out that each of the objections makes dispensable\nassumptions. For instance, why assume that the individuals whose needs\nare a target of policy will not play a role in the relevant\ndeterminations of what they need, how these might best be satisfied,\nor other important features of needs policy? In fact, on several\nimportant accounts, the decision procedures concerning how to settle\nquestions of need should include a range of individuals, including\nthose in need (Braybrooke 1987, Doyal and Gough 1991). So distribution\naccording to need is not automatically vulnerable to charges of\npaternalism, and the like. Particular decision-making procedures for\narriving at policies about needs may well be characterized in these\nterms, but this is not an inevitable feature of all such policies. \n\nThe concern about being overwhelmed by a bottomless pit of\nneeds-related responsibilities can be deflated similarly using various\nstrategies. One is to point out that claims of need might have\nvariable importance depending on key features such as the\nrelationships among relevant parties, resources available, and the\nburdens that meeting them would place on others (e.g. Copp 1998, Brock\n2009). And, of course, the issue of responsibilities that needs\ngenerate and how to distribute responsibilities for meeting needs is\nan enormous topic (e.g., Braybrooke 1987, Miller 1999, Miller 2007),\none that will be discussed below (for instance, in sections 4 and 5).\nFor now, it is worth pointing out that we need not assume what this\nobjection does, namely that meeting needs is an all or nothing affair,\nso that either needs have normative force (in which case they have too\nmuch) or else they can have none at all. \n\nPhilosophers have suggested various ways to identify the needs that\nwarrant normative attention. While there are several common elements\nin these accounts, they also reveal important differences. We review\nhere five of the more prominent accounts in the philosophical\nliterature on needs. \n\nHarry Frankfurt (1984) asks how needs must be understood if they are\nto have the special moral significance that we attribute to them\nrelative to mere desires. He argues that we must distinguish between\nfree volitional needs, where an item is needed only to satisfy a\ndesire over which a person has control—he could choose not to\nhave it; constrained volitional needs, where an item is needed to\nsatisfy a desire a person cannot rid himself of, such as an\naddiction; and non-volitional needs that are entirely independent of\ndesires, such as a sick person’s need for medicine. Only in the\ncase of the latter two categories of need will a person be harmed by\nbeing denied what she needs, Frankfurt argues, and it is only these\nneeds that have the special moral force that the language of\n‘need’ is usually understood to convey. \n\nHarm arising from factors beyond one’s control is also central\nto why needs matter, when they do, on David Wiggins’s account\n(1987, 1998). Wiggins develops these ideas and introduces various\nterms to reflect central features of the concept. There is the gravity\nof the harm that would ensue if the need is not met\n(‘badness’), which is different from the\nurgency to prevent harm from ensuing. Needs may be\nentrenched when they are inflexible to modification, or\nsubstitutable when they are not. A need is basic if\nit results from a law of nature, an unalterable and invariable\nenvironmental fact, or a fact about human constitution. Using this\nterminology, Wiggins defines vital needs as ones that are bad in a way\nthat is entrenched and scarcely substitutable, and it is these vital\nneeds that matter morally according to him. \n\nDavid Braybrooke (1987) develops an account of basic needs that\nconnects needs to social functioning. For Braybrooke something is a\nbasic need if, without its satisfaction, one would be unable to carry\nout four basic social roles, namely, those of citizen, parent,\nhouseholder, and worker. By reflecting on what is needed to have the\ngenuine choice to adopt the role or carry out tasks associated with\nit, we can arrive at a list of needs. To assist in this process he\nalso examines several proposed lists and extracts many common elements\nthat, over the course of a life, are necessary for the four roles he\nidentifies as important. Focusing on what humans typically do (through\nconsideration of these roles) provides Braybrooke with a good\nreference point for compiling this list. The needs that make the list\nare the need for a life-supporting relation to the environment; for\nwhatever is indispensable to preserving the body intact in important\nrespects (including food, water, exercise, and periodic rest); for\ncompanionship; for education; for social acceptance and recognition;\nfor sexual activity; for recreation; and for freedom from harassment,\nincluding not being continually frightened. \n\nLen Doyal and Ian Gough (1991) offer a highly influential account that\naims to connect philosophical and empirical disciplines. On their\nview, needs are universalizable preconditions that enable non-impaired\nparticipation in any form of life. Physical health and autonomy (by\nwhich they mean the mental competence to deliberate and choose) are\nthe two basic needs. An additional class of intermediate needs connect\nthese two basic needs with social science knowledge that can be useful\nin measuring needs fulfilment. The intermediate needs are nutritious\nfood and clean water, protective housing, a non-hazardous work\nenvironment, a non-hazardous physical environment, appropriate health\ncare, security in childhood, significant primary relationships,\nphysical security, economic security, appropriate education, safe\nbirth control, and safe child-bearing. Armed with these intermediate\nneeds they drill down even further, offering specific ideas about the\nkinds of metrics we should adopt to help gain a sense of whether needs\nare being met. These metrics are also helpful in measuring progress\nwith respect to meeting needs over time. \n\nDavid Miller (1999, ch. 10; 2007, ch. 7) follows Wiggins conceptually\nin defining needs as conditions that must be met if a person is not to\nsuffer harm. But the harm in question is not merely\nphysiological. Instead, on Miller’s view, a person is harmed\nwhen she is unable to live a minimally decent life in the society to\nwhich she belongs. Needs, therefore, cannot be identified without\nreference to the social norms that define the requirements of decency\nin a particular place. Since this will depend on cultural factors\npeculiar to each society, Miller further distinguishes\nbetween basic needs and societal needs, where the\nformer are understood as the conditions required for a decent life\nin any society, and the latter as the larger set of\nrequirements for a decent life in the particular society to which a\nperson belongs. Thus food is a basic need, while literacy is a\nsocietal need in any technologically advanced society. Miller argues\nthat this societal variability does not impugn the objectivity or\nmoral force of need claims. \n\nThere are some important common elements to these and other recent\naccounts of normatively salient needs. The needs that matter morally\nare those that are necessary, indispensable, or inescapable, at least\nwith respect to some important goals such as human functioning in\nsocial groups (Braybrooke 1987, Thomson 1987, Wiggins 1998), our\nability to function as human agents (Copp 1998, Gewirth 1978,\nO’Neill 1998, Shue 1980), or promoting human flourishing (Reader\n2005) especially when we consider the many ways in which human agents\ntypically engage with their social environments. While needs theorists\nare of the view that normatively salient needs must be importantly\nconnected to functioning in social settings, they vary on\nwhether only widely shared needs can have this standing or\nwhether needs that are specific to particular people can have this\nstanding as well. Reader (2007, chs. 4–5) is notable for her\nclaim that there is nothing normatively special about needs that are\nrooted in common human nature, though she adds that while this holds\ntrue in moral philosophy, in political philosophy and policy it is\nunderstandable that widely recognized and entrenched needs should be\nthe focus of attention. \n\nGiven the prominent role that needs appear to play in popular\nconceptions of social justice, it may seem remarkable that they have\nbeen largely sidelined in the theories of distributive justice\ndeveloped by philosophers over the last half century, as this section\nwill demonstrate. It is perhaps not a surprise that libertarian\ntheorists such as Robert Nozick should deny that justice might require\nredistribution on behalf of those in need (Nozick 1974, ch. 8; for a\ncritique see Brock 1995). On such a view, while it might be charitable\nor benevolent to help a person in need, justice is defined in terms of\nthe obligation to respect an individual’s personal and property\nrights, and so need only becomes relevant when a person’s needy\ncondition is the result of a prior rights-violation (say, because they\nhave been robbed of their means of subsistence). \n\nMost liberal philosophers, however, rather than explicitly rejecting\nclaims of need, have chosen instead to subsume them within some\nbroader theory of justice, thereby denying them any special force.\nConsider, for example, utilitarian philosophers who advocate using\noverall welfare, understood either as happiness or as desire\nsatisfaction, as the goal by which proposed policies should be\nevaluated. Needs will feature indirectly in this picture: an\nunfulfilled need is likely to be a source of pain or frustration, a\nfulfilled need a source of satisfaction. But there is no reason of\nprinciple to discriminate between, for example, a need and a strong\ndesire. As we saw in section 2.2.1, Griffin (1986) uses the example of\nscholars preferring to build a library extension in place of a gym to\nillustrate the error in supposing that needs should always trump\nwell-informed wants. From a welfarist perspective, there is nothing\nspecial about meeting claims of need. \n\nJohn Rawls’s theory of justice is often presented as a\ncorrective to the deficiencies of utilitarianism. But like his\nutilitarian rivals, Rawls pays no specific attention to needs. In the\nfirst full presentation of his theory, what Rawls refers to as\n‘the precept of need’ is given one paragraph in a book of\n600 pages (Rawls 1971, 276–77). The reason for this neglect\nis fairly clear. According to Rawls, social justice concerns the\ndistribution of ‘primary goods’—listed as\n‘rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, income and\nwealth’—and he assesses that distribution by looking at\nhow representative individuals occupying different social positions,\nlike unskilled worker, fare. So the need claims of particular\nindividuals, such as those with disabilities or special health care\nrequirements, never enter the picture (see further Sen 1980).  Rawls\nspeaks of needs only when discussing the transfer branch of\ngovernment, which is supposed to correct the market distribution of\nincome and wealth by giving resources to those who are worst off\neconomically. In other words, need-based claims for income are\nsubsumed under the general principle of controlling inequalities so as\nto maximise the living standard of the least advantaged\ngroup—the so-called ‘difference principle’ (Rawls\n1971, § 12–13). Rawls mentions in passing a different kind\nof justice that concerns the allocation of goods to particular\npersons, but at this stage he simply excludes it from his theory as a\npotentially misleading distraction (Rawls 1971, 88–89). \n\nIn his later presentation of the theory (Rawls 2001), Rawls tried to\nrespond to the charge that he had overlooked one important dimension\nof social justice by failing to notice how citizens who had the same\nshare of primary goods might nonetheless have very different\nindividual needs (for this criticism, see especially Sen 1980, 1992,\nch. 5). He did so by arguing that access to medical care,\nspecifically, should be regarded as one component of the basic bundle\nof goods whose size the difference principle aimed to maximise (Rawls\n2001, § 51).  Each citizen could anticipate that over the course\nof her lifetime she could expect to require some medical treatment,\nand so access to health care should be factored into the calculation\nof her life prospects. Rawls did not, however, have anything more\nspecific to say about justice in health care—for instance about\nwho among the needy had the strongest claims to be treated—nor\nabout needs of other kinds, nor about the position of people with\nserious disabilities who could not aspire to be ‘fully\nco-operating members of society’. Thus arguably the most\ninfluential theory of social justice to have appeared in the last\nhalf-century virtually eliminated need as an independent criterion of\ndistribution. \n\nConsider next Ronald Dworkin’s ‘equality of\nresources’ view (Dworkin 1981). This might appear to give more\nscope to needs than Rawls’s theory by virtue of the fact that it\nregards personal capacities and incapacities as among the resources\nthat a theory of justice must take into account. Thus insofar as need\ncan be represented as an internal resource deficiency, we might expect\nDworkin to count it as a feature that may entitle its bearer to\nreceive additional resources by way of compensation. And he does\nindeed devote some attention both to the issue of people with\nhandicaps and to the issue of health care in Dworkin 2000 (especially\nchs 2 and 8). He tackles this problem through the device of\nhypothetical insurance: to illustrate this in the case of medical\nneeds, in order to decide what provision a state should make for\nhealth care—how much it should spend and what priorities it\nshould adopt when resources are scarce—we should ask what health\ncare insurance people would buy in advance if they did not know what\ntheir own medical needs would turn out to be. Since this is likely to\nvary from one person to the next, depending on how averse they are to\nparticular risks, Dworkin has to stipulate that what justice requires\nthe state to provide is the level of coverage that most people would\nchoose to buy under these conditions. In reaching a decision, people\nwould be expected to trade off buying different levels of insurance\nagainst other ways of using their money. So again this is a case in\nwhich need considerations get subsumed under a wider principle, in\nthis case compensating people for disadvantages which they would have\ninsured against suffering in advance. Need claims aren’t allowed\nto have independent force. Dworkin’s answer to the question\n‘is satisfying this particular need a matter of justice?’\nis ‘it depends on whether people generally would have chosen to\npurchase insurance against the chance of having it’. The same\nprinciple is applied to other misfortunes, such as the chance of\nbecoming unemployed. \n\nFinally here, consider so-called luck egalitarian theories of\ndistributive justice (see, for example, Temkin 1993; Knight 2009;\nCohen 2011, Part 1; Knight and Stemplowska 2011; Tan 2012). These hold\nthat no-one should be worse off than anyone else unless they are\nresponsible for being worse-off, for example by developing expensive\ntastes or gambling away their resources. Conversely, inequalities that\ncan be attributed to brute luck—such as a storm that demolishes\nmy house but not yours—should be compensated for by\nredistribution from the lucky to the unlucky. At first sight, it looks\nas though this principle will be sensitive to variations in need:\nbeing prone to disease or requiring more calories than average to stay\nhealthy look like exactly the kind of involuntary misfortunes that\nluck egalitarians will seek to rectify via resource transfers. But\nnotice that special needs of this sort are treated no differently from\nother sources of disadvantage, like having meagre talents or being\nborn into a poor family. Luck egalitarians use an undiscriminating,\nand often ill-defined, currency of advantage/disadvantage that can\nrespond to the fact that some people are needier than others, but\nwithout giving those differences any special weight. Notice also that\na luck egalitarian will distinguish between needs that a person has as\na result of her innate bodily features or of accidents that befall\nher, and needs that she has as a result of lifestyle or other choices\nfor which she is personally responsible, and will mandate that she be\ncompensated only for having special needs in the first category. This\nhas led critics such as Anderson (1999) to accuse the doctrine of\nharshness for abandoning negligent victims and discriminating among\nthe disabled according to the source of their disability. For luck\negalitarians, justice doesn’t require that we should respond to\npeople’s needs regardless of how they have arisen. \n\nFor those who believe that claims of need can also be claims of\njustice, the idea that what justice requires is that resources should\nbe distributed according to need has an obvious appeal: the\nneedier someone is, the more resources they should be assigned.  Marx\nfamously wrote that in the higher state of communist society, resource\ndistribution would be governed by the principle ‘from each\naccording to his ability, to each according to his needs’ (Marx\n1977, 569). But he prefaced this by pointing out that this could\nonly happen once ‘the productive forces have also increased with\nthe all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of\nco-operative wealth flow more abundantly’—that is to say,\nscarcity had been overcome. Because of this assumption, it is arguable\nwhether the principle as proposed by Marx should be seen as a\nprinciple of justice, or as a principle for a world that has moved\nbeyond the circumstances for justice (see Buchanan 1982; Lukes 1985,\nch.4; Wood 1980). \n\nUnder conditions of abundance, it is perfectly clear what distribution\naccording to need entails: everyone should receive the resources that\nare required to fulfil all of their needs. The much more difficult\nquestion is to provide an interpretation of the principle under\nconditions of scarcity where needs cannot be met in full (for longer\ndiscussions, see Miller 1999, ch. 10 and Miller, forthcoming). We can\nthink of each person as having a need-based claim which is measured by\nthe size of the gap between what she now has, and what she would have\nto be given to meet her need in full. For example, if for a healthy\nlife a woman needs food that provides 2000 kilocalories per day, but\nthe amount of food now available to her only provides 1500, then her\nclaim is for additional food that provides 500 kilocalories. It might\nthen seem that to distribute according to need means to distribute in\nproportion to the size of claims: the person whose claim is 1000 kcal\nshould receive twice as much food as the person whose claim is\n500. This models distribution according to need on distribution\naccording to (comparative) desert, where a proportionality principle\nis generally thought to be the appropriate one to use. But in the case\nof needs, there are two objections to this solution. \n\nFirst, there is no general reason to think that people will be equally\neffective in converting need-satisfying resources into satisfied\nneeds. This will depend, for example, on the body’s capacity to\nmetabolize food or medicine. So a distribution of resources that is\nproportionate to initial need claims won’t necessarily bring\nabout a proportionate decrease in those claims. Second, even if\nconversion rates are the same, applying the proportionality principle\nwill still leave those with larger initial claims worse off. For\nexample, suppose we only have enough food to supply 600 kcal of energy\nto the two people in the previous paragraph. Using the proportionality\nprinciple, we award 400 kcal to the first person and 200 kcal to the\nsecond. But the outcome is that the first person is left with an\nunsatisfied claim for 600 kcal and the second for only 300\nkcal. Intuitively, this is not what it means to attend to their needs\nfairly. \n\nThis suggests an alternative principle: distribute in whatever way\nleaves people at the end of the distribution with unsatisfied claims\nthat are as nearly equal in size as possible. In the example given,\nthat would mean aiming for an outcome in which each person falls 450\nkcal short of a fully adequate diet. But this too faces\nobjections. One is that it may look implausible in cases where some\npeople are very poor at converting resources into\nneed-satisfaction. Suppose, for example, we have to allocate medical\nresources between a number of people some of whom are very ill but\nwhose condition can be improved only slightly by the resources we\nhave. The equal outcome principle may entail devoting all of the\navailable resources to those people, and this may seem unfair to those\nwho otherwise could be helped much more. The principle in its\nunqualified form might also recommend levelling down—i.e.,\nwithholding resources from people where supplying them would have the\neffect of increasing final inequality in need-satisfaction. \n\nIn complete contrast, distribution according to need could be\ninterpreted to mean minimising unmet need, in other words satisfying\nneed claims to the greatest possible extent overall. This, however,\nseems more like a principle of efficiency than a principle of\njustice. As such, it is vulnerable to the objection that it\ndoesn’t take seriously the separateness of persons. It is likely\nto require consistently favouring those who are best at converting\nresources into need-satisfaction, and conversely it may recommend\ndoing nothing for people who have large need claims but whose\nsituation is such that it can only materially be improved by deploying\na lot of resources. Once again this seems intuitively unfair. \n\nIt follows that to assess what someone is due under a needs-based\nprinciple of distribution, we will have to take into account at least\nthe following three factors: how large their claim is in absolute\nterms; how large their claim is compared with the claims of others in\nthe relevant group; and how capable they are of converting resources\ninto diminished levels of need. This raises the question whether there\nis any single principle of distribution that is sensitive to each of\nthese factors. One principle that might appear to be is the weighted\npriority principle defended, for example, in Crisp 2002.  Whereas a\nstrict priority principle tells us always to begin by attending to\nthose with the largest need claims—and therefore fall foul of\nthe problem noted above, of paying no attention to relative capacity\nto benefit, so that it may instruct us to focus exclusively on\nbringing about small improvements in the condition of the most\nneedy—a weighted priority principle works differently. It\ncalculates gains by multiplying reductions in needs score by a factor\nthat reflects the absolute starting position of the person in\nquestion. So if we return to the simple case where one person needs\n1000 kcals and another 500 kcals, and use an arithmetic weighting\nfactor, then we would count reducing the first person’s level of\nneed to 800 kcals as equivalent to reducing the second person’s\nlevel of need to 400. The needier person’s gain is treated as\ntwice as significant as the less needy person’s. \n\nBut this principle too has implications that in some cases seem\ncounterintuitive. One is that, despite the tilt in favour of the\nneediest, there are going to be cases in which it advocates helping a\nlarge number of less needy people instead. If enough people can have\nminor headaches relieved at the cost of denying someone a kidney\ntransplant, the principle will advocate doing that. Crisp responds to\nthis problem by introducing a needs threshold such that those with\nrelatively trivial needs are excluded at the first stage of\nimplementation and only come into consideration if there are surplus\nresources after the weighted priority principle is applied to those\nabove the threshold. But, as he himself puts it, ‘where the\nthreshold falls, of course, is the key question any proponent of this\nview must answer’ (Crisp 2002, 140). \n\nAnother problem with the weighted priority view is that it pays no\ndirect attention to horizontal fairness between people, in the\nfollowing sense: we think that if two people begin in the same\ncondition of need—say they have sustained similar\ninjuries—there is value in their receiving treatment that gives\nthem the same outcome, so long as this is feasible and not excessively\ncostly. But the weighted priority principle cannot ensure this, since\nit has a bias in favour of the victim who can be treated at lesser\ncost; by choosing to treat that person rather than the equally needy\nother, more needs overall can be satisfied. So although there might be\nexceptional cases in which we are willing to practice a form of\ntriage, because we can see that treating John’s needs will have\nopportunity costs that are simply too high, the weighted priority\nprinciple risks taking us too far in that direction. \n\nA variant on the weighted priority view has been proposed by Hassoun\nin the form of her ‘effectiveness principle’, defined as\nfollows: \n\nFirst, rank the possible policies from best to worst according to how\nmuch weighted need they alleviate. Second, rank the possible policies\nfrom best to worst according to the number of people they help. Third,\nfor each policy, combine its ranking in terms of how much weighted\nneed it alleviates with its ranking for how many people it helps to\nyield its final score (Hassoun 2009, 259–60). \n\nThe new element introduced by Hassoun here is the idea that needs\npolicies are better to the extent that they help more people rather\nthan fewer even if the overall improvement in (weighted)\nneed-satisfaction remains the same. Of course this would be liable to\nmake matters worse in the kind of case that worries Crisp. Where the\nweighted priority principle can be faulted for allowing many\nrelatively minor need claims to outweigh the more serious claims of a\nfew badly-off people, adding in a component that gives credit simply\nfor the number of people who are aided only adds to the\nproblem. Nonetheless, it is worth asking whether the justice of an\nallocation should be sensitive to the sheer number of people whose\nneeds are met. \n\nOne reason for thinking so might be that it always shows respect for a\nperson to attend practically to their needs, even if only in a small\nway. So the more people who are treated when an allocation is\nperformed, the more recognition is extended to those in need. The\nchallenge, however, is to understand why sufficient respect is not\nbeing shown when everyone’s claims are properly\nconsidered by whoever is performing an allocation, even if the\nend result is that some people get nothing because whatever claim they\nmight have is justifiably outweighed by the stronger claims of other\npeople. So one might question whether the numbers being aided has\nthe deeper significance that Hassoun’s effectiveness principle\nimplies, as opposed merely to providing evidence that no-one’s\nclaim has been overlooked. \n\nThe upshot of this discussion is that in conditions of scarcity, there\nis no uniquely defensible way of spelling out the principle of\ndistribution according to need. We face conflicting imperatives: to\nmeet as many needs as possible, taking into account how much each\ncosts to satisfy, and to preserve comparative justice by ensuring that\npeople whose needs are similar are treated in the same way. This can\nbe presented as a trade-off between efficiency and justice, but since\nas noted earlier we are often required to meet needs as a matter of\njustice, it can also be seen as a clash between non-comparative and\ncomparative justice. \n\nNeeds have long played a role as guides to public policy, not only\ndomestically but also internationally, where the so-called Basic Needs\nApproach to global poverty and international development became\ndominant in the 1970s and early 1980s. More recently, however, it has\nbeen displaced by the ‘capabilities approach’ developed\nespecially by Amartya Sen and implemented in policy instruments such\nas the UN’s Human Development Index. Sen (1984) argued that the\nbasic needs approach was too narrow for these purposes, as well as\nbeing defective for a number of other reasons, and should therefore be\nsubsumed within his capabilities approach. In this section we review\nthe arguments for and against replacing needs with capabilities as a\ntool of policy evaluation (see also Reader 2006). For a much fuller\ndiscussion of capabilities themselves,\n see the entry on\n the capability approach.\n  \n\nThe capability approach provides a way of measuring a person’s\nlevel of well-being. It combines two elements:\n‘functionings’, that is the various activities that a\nperson performs or states that they achieve, and\n‘capabilities’, that is the option of realizing\nfunctionings if one so chooses. Thus ‘being adequately\nnourished’ and ‘working as a computer programmer’\nare examples of functionings, whereas ‘having the choice to be\nadequately nourished’ and ‘having the option to work as a\ncomputer programmer’ are examples of capabilities. The approach\nplaces most emphasis on capabilities out of a concern for freedom of\nchoice. A concern for functionings alone, it is argued, might justify\nforcing people to behave in certain ways (eat healthy food, for\nexample). A person’s well-being is then measured by the size of\nher capability set: the more capabilities she has, the better off she\nis judged to be. \n\nAs will immediately be clear, capabilities capture many more aspects\nof human well-being than do needs, and this is claimed to be an\nadvantage of the approach. But it comes with a corresponding\ndisadvantage, namely that capabilities lack the normative force that\nneeds possess. Some capabilities (like the option of being adequately\nnourished) are morally important, while others (like the option to buy\na fancy sports car) are trivial. So whereas a person’s being in\nneed always counts as a strong pro tanto reason to aid them,\na person’s lacking a capability may be of no moral concern at\nall. \n\nIn response to this problem, Sen has introduced the idea of\n‘basic capabilities’, understood as ‘the ability to\nsatisfy certain elementary and crucially important functionings up to\ncertain levels’ (Sen 1992, 45), for use in definitions of global\npoverty. In this case the basic needs approach and the capabilities\napproach will converge, since identifying these ‘crucially\nimportant functionings’ will involve the same exercise as\nidentifying universal human needs, namely establishing what is\nnecessary for human beings to enjoy a minimally decent life.  It is a\nmistake, therefore, to imagine that by switching from needs to\ncapabilities one can avoid the difficult semi-empirical task of\nestablishing what conditions are essential to human beings if they are\nto avoid being harmed. \n\nCapability theorists, including Sen, have levelled a number of\ncriticisms against the basic needs approach. One is that the approach\nis excessively commodity-focused. However, this criticism does not\nseem to be appropriate if we look at either the original or subsequent\ndefenders of needs as a policy tool for international development\n(though perhaps the complaint has more traction if targeted at the\nimplementation priorities of the time). The original defenders often\nincluded non-material needs, such as employment (Streeten 1981;\nStewart 1985). More generally, there is no reason to assume that only\ncommodities are relevant need satisfiers, and this is obvious when we\nlook at how needs theorists develop their accounts (see further Reader\n2006). Consider Braybrooke (1987) as one prominent example: his list\nincludes such important items as the need for a life-supporting\nrelation to the environment, for social acceptance and recognition,\nfor freedom from harassment, and for companionship. Indeed, reflecting\non the whole list, we notice that while commodities might be relevant\nto satisfying some of these needs, they are not relevant to (or only a\nvery small part of) fulfilling most of the items on his list. \n\nA second charge levelled by Sen is that ‘a concentration on just\nthe minimum requirements may lead to a softening of the opposition to\ninequality in general’ (Sen 1984, 515). This draws attention to\nthe fact that needs define a standard of sufficiency (see Frankfurt\n2015) and cannot be appealed to directly to determine how any\navailable surplus resources above that line should be allocated.\nHowever the point should not be overstated. In today’s world,\nreducing inequality by redistribution from rich to poor may be a\nnecessary precondition for meeting everyone’s basic needs.\nMoreover if we widen the focus to consider needs that arise in\nparticular societies, we will often find that needs and inequality\ninteract, since what is essential for a minimally decent life will\ndepend in part on the general standard of living in the society in\nquestion. It is for this reason that poverty is often defined in\nrelative terms, as having an income below a certain percentage of the\nsocial median. \n\nFinally, the most prominent claim made on behalf of the capability\napproach is that, unlike a needs-based approach, it puts front and\ncenter the values of choice and participation (Alkire 2002 and\n2005). There are several responses available to this objection. First,\nthe charge assumes that the recipients of needs-meeting policy will\nnot have their choices respected and, more generally, will not\nparticipate in activities aimed at meeting their needs. However we\nmight think that providing options for enabling people to meet their\nneeds, while leaving final choices to them as to whether they avail\nthemselves of those options, is all that plausible needs-directed\npolicy requires. There is plenty of scope for respecting choices \nconsistently with providing such options. Second, capability\ntheorists can be accused of a kind of “freedom fetishism”\nby overstating the importance of freedom of choice in many cases. Here\nwe might draw attention to the important problem of adaptive\npreferences which might lead people to fail to seize opportunities\nthat would otherwise allow them to meet their needs. In these\ncircumstances, less weight should be attached to people’s\nchoices or their expressed views about these choices. Indeed\ncapability theorists themselves recognize the force of this point\ninsofar as they include achieved functionings alongside capabilities\nin their overall metric of personal well-being. In some cases it is\nthe functioning itself, rather than the capability, that matters: if\nour task is to supply drinkable water to a village that up to now has\nlacked it, there is no reason to leave the old polluted well open so\nthat the villagers have the capacity to choose between clean and\nunclean water. Providing clean water is all that should concern\nus. \n\nFor much of this entry we have been considering needs in a societal\ncontext and have focused on needs-related responsibilities to\ncurrently existing members of our society. But questions about\nresponsibilities in connection with needs are certainly not confined\nto this context. Are nonhuman animals’ needs normatively\nsalient, and if so, how should they be weighed against human needs?\nShould the needs of future generations bear on current decisions\nconcerning distributing according to need? How should the grave and\nurgent needs of those in low-income countries condition\nresponsibilities to meet less dire needs of compatriots? These kinds\nof questions raise a huge range of further issues that we cannot\ndiscuss here. Fortunately, there are several entries in this\nEncyclopedia that discuss such questions and several of these are\nlisted in the section on Related Entries below. For more on the first\nquestion\n see \n moral status of animals.\n For more on the second issue see\n intergenerational justice.\n For more on the third topic see\n global justice\n and\n international distributive justice.\n ","contact.mail":"david.miller@nuffield.ox.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nuffield.ox.ac.uk"}]
