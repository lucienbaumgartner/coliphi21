This tradition contains a variety of teachings about how\nto live and what to do in various situations. Buddhism tells us to\npurify our own minds and to develop lovingkindness and compassion for\nall beings. The various forms of Buddhism offer systematic frameworks\nfor understanding the traits of character and types of actions that\ncause problems for ourselves and others, as well as those qualities\nand actions that help to heal the suffering of the world. When\nstarting a Buddhist path, one agrees to follow rules of moral\ndiscipline that forbid various destructive actions; but once the mind\nhas reached a very high degree of spiritual development, the rules are\ntranscended and one acts spontaneously for the benefit of others.\n\n\nBuddhism upholds lofty and demanding ethical values, but recognizes\nthe need to adapt those values to the conditions of the real world.\nFrom a Buddhist point of view, animal life is precious, and human life\nis even more so. Ideally we should refrain from killing animals, adopt\na vegetarian diet, renounce all forms of violence and live in harmony\nwith nature. Yet there are some difficult cases in which violence and\nkilling seem almost unavoidable. Some Buddhist writers have offered\nguidance on how to act appropriately and realistically in such\nsituations, without abandoning the compassion and lovingkindness that\nform the basis of the Buddhist approach to ethics.\n\nThe main goal of Buddhist practice is to reach freedom from suffering\nby coming to see the world as it actually is and abandoning the\ndistorted projections that our thoughts and emotions create. A very\nimportant means to reach this goal is to refrain from destructive\nactions, since these actions cause harm to others and create mental\ndisturbances in us that generate suffering and keep us from seeing\nthings as they are. Moreover, according to Buddhist teachings, those\nwho reach the goal of freedom thenceforward act in a loving and\ncompassionate manner towards others, helping these others in turn to\nbe more happy and free. Ethical action is thus both an important part\nof the Buddhist path and an important aspect of the results said to\nflow from that path. \nThere is no word in Buddhist languages such as Sanskrit, Pāli and\nTibetan that exactly corresponds to the English word\n“ethics.” The term most commonly translated as\n“ethics” is Sanskrit śīla (Pāli\nsīla, Tib. tshul khrims.) But this word\nactually means something more like “moral discipline”;\nsomeone has śīla when, having made a commitment to\nfollow a certain set of moral rules, she is actually disposed to\nfollow those rules. \nThere are central concepts of Western ethical theory that have no\nexact equivalent in Buddhist texts. It’s not clear that Buddhist\nthinkers have a concept of moral obligation at all. Moreover, Buddhist\ntexts often make points which we can understand in terms of the\ndistinction between intrinsic and instrumental value – that is,\nthe distinction between what is valuable in itself and what is\nvaluable as a means to bring about something else. But they have no\ntechnical terms that correspond to “intrinsic value” and\n“instrumental value.” And many statements that can be read\nas being about ethics can also be understood in a non-normative way,\nas descriptions of how a spiritually developed being actually\nbehaves. \nNevertheless, there are many statements in Buddhist scriptures and\ntreatises that are hard to understand otherwise than as ethical\nclaims. The Sanskrit terms kuśala and\nśubha are used in a strongly evaluative way and often\ntranslated as “good,” though in some contexts there are\nother possible translations (“skillful” for\nkuśala, “beautiful” for\nśubha). Buddhist texts talk about what we should do, and\nhold up models of spectacular altruism for our admiration and\nemulation. And Buddhism attaches considerable importance to systems of\nrules that codify moral discipline. \nA consideration that has motivated many Buddhists to vow to follow\nrules of moral discipline is a wish to avoid the karmic consequences\nof actions that harm others. These consequences have traditionally\nbeen understood largely in terms of rebirth in the various realms of\ncyclic existence. In the earliest texts, there are five such realms:\nthe hells, the worlds of hungry ghosts, animals, and humans, and the\nheavenly worlds of the gods (Skt. deva). Later texts add a\nsixth realm, that of the titans (Skt. asura). \nThe hells are terrible places of torture and suffering, in which\nbeings who are dominated by anger and hatred are cut to pieces,\nburned, frozen, and tormented by demonic apparitions that are in fact\nprojections of their own distorted minds. Hungry ghosts are depicted\nwith large bellies and tiny mouths; driven by greed, they seek\nendlessly for something to eat or drink, but even when they find a\nmorsel they can swallow, it turns into filth or fire in their mouths.\nAnimals are seen as dominated by stupidity, limited to a fixed set of\npossible behaviors and primarily trying simply to survive. In this\nsystem, the human world is primarily characterized by the instrumental\npursuit of objects of desire. The titans are powerful beings who live\nin relatively pleasant circumstances, but are driven by\ncompetitiveness and obsessively envious of the splendor of the gods.\nThey continually plot to invade the heavens. Unfortunately for the\ntitans, when they actually do battle with the gods, they always lose.\nThe gods of the lower heavens, the heavens of desire, live in palaces\nof astonishing beauty and exquisite sensual pleasure. Blinded by\npride, they disregard the suffering of those below them and ignore the\nfact that their high status is impermanent: they, too, will die. At\nthe top of cyclic existence, in the heavens of form and the formless\nheavens, other gods rest in a state of peaceful, quiet bliss, with\nalmost no manifest suffering and for vast, but finite, periods of\ntime. \nActions motivated by greed, hatred and delusion have a tendency to\ndrive those who do them into the three lower realms of suffering: the\nhells, the hungry ghost realm, and the animal realm. Actions carried\nout with better motivations, but still infused with a sense of self,\ntend to produce rebirth in the three higher realms of titans, humans,\nand gods. Vast numbers of sentient beings are trapped in this cycle,\ncontinually wandering from one realm to another, unable to escape and\nforced to experience the forms of suffering that exist in each realm.\nThe human realm is particularly fortunate, because it is only in this\nrealm that one can attain Awakening, which liberates one from the\nwhole cycle. \nSome modern teachers have interpreted the doctrine of the six realms\nas a psychological process unfolding in this one life: the realms are\nunderstood as the different ways we understand the world when under\nthe influence of the reactive emotions of anger, greed, stupidity,\ndesire, competitiveness, and pride. (See, e.g., McLeod 2002,\n146–51.) But historically, most Buddhists have taken this system\nliterally, as a cosmological account of how the world works and what\nhappens when we die. Therefore, to avoid the actions most likely to\ndrive them into the lower realms, many Buddhists have undertaken to\nobey rules of moral discipline. \nThe two most important systems of moral discipline in Buddhism are the\nFive Precepts, which apply to lay people, and the Vows of Individual\nLiberation (Skt. prātimokṣa) which apply to monks\nand nuns. Accepting these commitments is a crucial part of what\ndefines someone as a Buddhist lay person or as a Buddhist monastic.\nThe Five Precepts are quite similar to basic lists of prohibitions in\nother great world religions: those who take them make a commitment to\nrefrain from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and\ndrunkenness. The Vows of Individual Liberation are stricter, ruling\nout all forms of sexual activity and laying down detailed regulations\nfor monastic etiquette and deportment. \nFollowing the Five Precepts is said to lead to rebirth as a human and\nprevent rebirth in one of the lower realms of suffering. This form of\nmoral discipline helps people develop self-respect, so that they are\nconfident in appearing in any gathering. It prevents many forms of\ntrouble and suffering that harmful actions produce for both the agent\nand others. Meanwhile, the Vows of Individual Liberation help the\nmonastic community function in a way that serves the spiritual\ndevelopment of the monks and nuns. They also create a foundation for\nmeditation practice that leads toward freedom. \nOther notable aspects of Buddhist moral discipline are captured in a\nlist known as the Ten Good Courses of Action (Pāli\ndasa-kusala-kamma-patha). In the Tibetan tradition, these are\nreferred to simply as the Ten Virtues (dge ba bcu). They are\nnegatively phrased: each of the Ten Good Courses of Action just\nconsists in refraining from the corresponding element of the Ten Bad\nCourses of Action (mi dge ba bcu). The Ten Bad Courses of\nAction are: \n(See Keown, 1992, 30 for this list, with somewhat different\ntranslations.) Note that the behaviors forbidden by four of the five\nprecepts are included in this list, with the exception of drunkenness.\nThe reason for omitting drunkenness may be that getting drunk does not\nnecessarily harm others, though it may put one in a state in which the\nrisk of harming others is much greater. \nThe Ten Bad Courses of Action are traditionally classified into three\nactions of the body (1–3), four forms of speech (4–7), and\nthree mental states (8–10). Among the actions of speech,\ndivisive speech means speaking in a way as to aggravate conflict and\ndivide friends from each other. Harsh speech is speech motivated by\nanger that wounds another emotionally through insulting and severely\ncritical words. Idle chitchat is speech which fills time and absorbs\nattention without communicating anything of practical or spiritual\nimportance. \nThe three mental states on the list are closely related to the three\npoisons, which are among the most fundamental psychological causes of\nthe cycle of existence and the suffering that comes with it. The three\npoisons are attraction, aversion and indifference. When we encounter\nan experience that appears to strengthen and confirm our sense of\nself, we are attracted to that experience and attempt to prolong or\nrepeat it. When an experience appears to threaten our sense of self,\nwe react with aversion, trying to avoid it or push it away. Any\nexperience that doesn’t fall into these two categories seems\nunimportant; since we are indifferent to it, we ignore that\nexperience. Thus, in Buddhist teachings, indifference is very closely\nassociated with ignorance, confusion, and incorrect understandings of\nthe way things are. Completely overcoming these three poisons leads to\nliberation from cyclic existence, compassion, joy, freedom, and\nhappiness. \nThe lineages of Buddhism that have survived to the present day can be\ngrouped into three traditions: Theravāda, Mahāyāna, and\nVajrayāna. The Theravāda, or “Teaching of the\nElders,” is the dominant form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and in\nthe Southeast Asian nations of Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos.\nThe Mahāyāna, or “Great Way,” originated in\nIndia, but is now the principal form of Buddhism in the Chinese\ncultural sphere, which includes China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. East\nAsian forms of the Mahāyāna are outside the scope of this\narticle, but I will discuss Indian texts from the early period of this\ntradition. The Vajrayāna, or “Diamond Way,” is\npracticed by Buddhists in the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia,\nincluding Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Mongolia. A small number of\nJapanese Buddhists also belong to the Vajrayāna. \nBoth historically and doctrinally, the principal difference between\nthe Theravāda and the Mahāyāna lies in the goals they\nrecommend. Most Theravāda practitioners aspire to become Saints\n(Skt. Arhat, Pāli Arahant). The life in which\nsomeone becomes a Saint is that person’s last life; this person\nwill no longer be reborn, but will instead enter Nirvana at death. A\nsmall minority of Theravādins, however, aspire to become Buddhas.\nAs they understand that goal, a Buddha is someone who rediscovers the\ntruths of Buddhism after they have been lost to the world, and teaches\nthem to others so as to benefit them. The Theravāda tradition\nmaintains that, like Saints, Buddhas pass into Nirvana at death.\nBecoming a Buddha is believed to be more difficult and take more time\nthan becoming a Saint; it is a demanding path for a small minority. A\npractitioner who is on the way to becoming a Buddha is known in\nSanskrit as a bodhisattva (Pāli bodhisatta). \nBy contrast, all serious Mahāyānists take the bodhisattva\nvow, promising to become Buddhas in order to help all beings. Indeed,\nsome scholars have concluded that the Mahāyāna movement\nbegan within the framework of early Buddhism as a group of\npractitioners holding the same doctrines and embracing the same\nrituals as their fellow Buddhists, and distinguished only by their\ncommon choice to follow the path to Buddhahood. However, over time,\nmany other differences evolved. In particular, mature\nMahāyāna traditions tend to hold that those who have become\nBuddhas, even after they die, continue to manifest in various forms\nand in various parts of cyclic existence in order to carry on the work\nof benefiting beings. They will remain in cyclic existence until all\nsentient beings have reached liberation. \nFollowers of Vajrayāna also embrace the commitment to become\nBuddhas for the benefit of all beings. The Vajrayāna can be seen\nas a branch of the Mahāyāna, since it shares the same\nspiritual goal. The main differences between the Vajrayāna and\nother forms of Mahāyāna concern ritual, iconography, and\nmeditation techniques. Those who practice Vajrayāna seek to\nattain Mahāyāna goals using Tantric means. \nThe Theravāda is the only surviving tradition of Buddhism that is\nnot Mahāyāna. But at one time, there were many such\ntraditions: eighteen, according to one influential classification.\nHowever, apart from the Theravāda, all of these traditions have\ndied out. There is no generally accepted term to refer collectively to\nall the Buddhist lineages that held Sainthood as their primary\nspiritual aspiration. In Mahāyāna texts, these forms of\nBuddhism are called Hīnayāna, the “lesser\nvehicle”, a pejorative term. More neutrally, these texts\nsometimes refer to Buddhists who aspire to Sainthood as Disciples\n(Skt. Śrāvaka) and their path as the Way of the\nDisciples (Skt. Śrāvaka-yāna). Some scholars\nhave proposed the term “Mainstream Buddhism.” \nMahāyāna texts repeatedly affirm the superiority of their\napproach to the non-Mahāyāna forms of Buddhist practice.\nAccording to these texts, the Disciples wish to attain Nirvana for\nthemselves alone, so that they disregard the needs of others. Since\nthey choose a less difficult path, their aspiration is inferior. Since\nthey propose to abandon other beings trapped in the prison of cyclic\nexistence, on this account, the Disciples lack compassion. \nThese criticisms may be unfair; it can be argued that they are\ndirected at a straw man and not at the real Theravāda tradition.\nMost lineages of Buddhism, including the Theravāda, value and\npractice the Four Divine Abidings (Pāli\nbrahma-vihāra), also known as the Four Immeasurables.\nThese are lovingkindness (Pāli metta), compassion\n(karuṇā), joy (pamudita) and equanimity\n(upekkhā). The content of lovingkindness is a wish for\nothers to be happy. Lovingkindness, which can be a very enjoyable\nstate, is a kind of opening to others and to the reality of their\nlives. The content of compassion is a wish for others to be free from\nsuffering. This quality makes it possible to be fully aware and\npresent in the face of others’ suffering. Joy is traditionally\nunderstood as the ability to rejoice in the happiness and good\nqualities of others. To operate in someone, joy requires the absence\nof envy, jealousy and self-hatred. Equanimity makes it possible to see\nsituations as they are, without preference or prejudice. It makes it\npossible to extend the other three Divine Abidings equally to all\nbeings. \nMost emotions that ordinary people experience are overcome or\ntransformed by the path; someone who was fully awake would not abide\nin or act from greed, hatred, competitiveness, or pride, for example.\nBut the Four Divine Abidings are emotions in which awake people rest\nand from which they act. Not only are these qualities recognized in\nthe Theravāda, they are extensively practiced in that tradition.\nIn fact, the Metta Sutta, the Discourse on\nLovingkindness, is one of the most important and frequently\nrecited scriptures in Southeast Asia today. Any discussion of\nsimilarities and differences between Theravāda and\nMahāyāna should take these facts into account. \nThe Mahāyāna path to awakening, like many textual\ndiscussions of that path, is organized around the qualities known as\nthe Six Perfections (Skt. pāramitā). The Six\nPerfections are: \nKṣānti, the third perfection, is a complex\nconcept, difficult to render with a single English word. It has three\nmain aspects. One is the ability to endure and maintain one’s\ncalm and clarity of intention in the face of obstacles such as\nfrustrations, delays, and unpleasant sensations.\n“Patience” would be a plausible translation for this\naspect of kṣānti. The second, and most important,\naspect of the perfection is the ability to remain peaceful, not\nbecoming angry, when other people harm us or cause difficulties for\nus. This second and primary aspect could justify a translation as\n“forbearance”. When insulted, someone with strong moral\ndiscipline would not retaliate, but might become angry and restrain\nthe expression of the anger; someone with strong patient endurance\nwould not become angry in the first place. The term\nkṣānti is also often used to refer to the ability\nto remain calm and not react with fear or anger when hearing\npresentations of the ultimate truth, the way things really are. \nPerseverance, the fourth perfection, is the ability to pour energy\nenthusiastically into constructive activities that benefit oneself and\nothers. Meditative stability, the fifth perfection, is the ability to\nmaintain clear, stable attention during meditation practice. Though\nthoughts may arise during meditation, they do not cause distraction in\nsomeone with strong meditative stability, but merely appear as\nmovements of mind. Prajñā, which could be\ntranslated as “wisdom” or as “discernment,” is\ndifficult to define and varies subtly in meaning among different\nBuddhist lineages. This quality allows those who have it to make\ndistinctions between phenomena and to understand things as they\nactually are. It is often described as intuitively based and can only\npartially be put into words. \nThe term pāramitā, which I have been translating as\n“perfection,” could also be rendered as\n“transcendence.” In order to awaken fully, a bodhisattva\nmust train in these qualities so deeply as to transcend how they are\nordinarily understood. This is done by achieving what is known as\n“the threefold purity,” meaning that the bodhisattva does\nnot regard either herself, the action being performed, or the object\nof that action as being a real, objectively existing thing. So, for\nexample, someone who thinks that he has a substantial self and is\ngiving real food to an objectively existing recipient would be showing\nworldly generosity. But someone who can give while regarding herself,\nthe gift, and the recipient as like mirages, existing only from a\ncertain point of view and not in objective reality, can practice the\ntransmundane perfection of generosity. (On this see, e.g., Huntington\ntrans. 1989, 150.) \nBuddhist texts don’t often take up the question of the general\ntheoretical principles that differentiate between good and bad, or\nright and wrong; they more often tend to lay down a variety of\nparticular moral rules, guidelines, virtues, and vices, and leave the\nmatter there. But when the texts do address what differentiates right\nfrom wrong in general, they tend to focus on the consequences of our\ndecisions and actions. Take, for instance, this passage from the\nAdvice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhikā: \nThis passage identifies the criterion of permissible action in terms\nof consequences, and in particular, consequences that consist of\nhappiness and suffering. Passages such as this one suggest the\npossibility of regarding Theravāda ethics as having a\nconsequentialist foundation. \nMost Buddhist authors don’t say enough about the overall\nstructure of their normative commitments to make it possible to\nattribute any particular ethical theory to them. One exception would\nbe Śāntideva (late 7th-mid 8th century CE), whose writings\ncontain a number of passages of great interest from the perspective of\nethical theory. Perhaps the most revealing of these can be found in\nthe Training Anthology\n(Śikṣā-samuccaya) at standard page 15 (see\nGoodman 2016a, 17). The passage reads: \nHere Śāntideva focuses our attention on the future\nconsequences that our actions can causally “stop” or\n“bring about”; at least in this passage, he seems to be\nadvocating consequentialism. In particular, what Śāntideva\nis concerned with here is the experienced quality of certain feelings;\nhe is trying to stop “pain and suffering” and bring about\n“pleasure and happiness.” Philosophers use the term\n“hedonism” to refer to the view that takes the presence of\nhappiness and the absence of suffering to constitute well-being.\nMoreover, the view Śāntideva advocates is universalist,\nbecause it extends moral concern to all sentient beings. It’s\nfairly clear, moreover, that Śāntideva is an advocate of\nmaximization: he regards it as mandatory to bring about a small amount\nof suffering to prevent a greater amount, and to sacrifice a small\namount of happiness to achieve a larger amount. And since he does not\nsay anything about constraints or important considerations arising\nfrom the distribution of happiness and suffering, the most plausible\nreading of this passage would involve accepting aggregation, in which\nthe happiness and suffering of all beings are considered together,\nwithout attaching significance to how these are distributed. Now the\nethical view called “classical utilitarianism” can be\ndefined as aggregative, maximizing, universalist, hedonist\nconsequentialism. This passage, then, can most naturally be\ninterpreted as a statement of the classical utilitarian form of\nconsequentialism. \nThough this passage gives us strong reasons to accept that\nŚāntideva is committed to assigning impartial benevolence a\ncentral role in how we should live and behave toward others, a number\nof scholars have questioned whether we have enough evidence to\ninterpret him as a utilitarian (e.g., Harris 2015). And as Michael\nBarnhart and others have argued, even if Śāntideva himself\nactually was a utilitarian, it does not follow that such a view can be\nattributed to the Buddhist tradition as a whole (Barnhart 2012,\n19). \nAccording to many of the world’s intellectual traditions, each\nperson is a real, individual substance with a true essence or self.\nAccording to Buddhism, this widely held view is false; you are not a\nsubstance. Instead, all there is to a person is a complex, rapidly\nchanging stream of mental and physical phenomena, connected by causal\nlinks and inextricably interrelated with the rest of the universe.\nThis view is known as the doctrine of no self (Pāli\nanattā; Skt. anātman.) Śāntideva\ndraws on this teaching to argue that egoism is irrational, and that we\nshould work for the benefit of all sentient beings. As he writes,\n“Without exception, no sufferings belong to anyone. They are to\nbe warded off simply because they are suffering. Why is any limitation\nput on this?” (Crosby and Skilton trans. 1995, 97) If you are\nnot a real thing, there is no reason to place any greater intrinsic\nimportance on preventing your own future suffering than on preventing\nthe future suffering of others. As writers such as Mark Siderits\n(2003, ch. 9) have often noted, this strategy for justifying altruism,\nwhich many scholars now call the Ownerless Suffering Argument, closely\nresembles the arguments for consequentialism in Parfit 1984 (ch. 15).\nIn fact, it’s hard to see how the Ownerless Suffering Argument\ncould support any moral view that is not some form of universalist\nconsequentialism. \nFrom the perspective of this argument, your suffering has no greater\nsignificance than that of anyone else, but it also has no less. You\nare one of the many sentient beings whose welfare is to be promoted.\nMoreover, you may have more effective means available to advance your\nown happiness than you do to advance the happiness of others. And you\noften know much more about yourself than you do about others. So there\nis scope within this view to justify prudential concern for your own\nfuture; in the early and middle stages of the path, you may end up in\npractice spending more time taking care of your own future needs than\nthose of others. This kind of prudential concern is compatible with\nthe doctrine of no self, and is not the same as egoism. Here egoism\nwould mean attaching more intrinsic significance to your own welfare\nthan to that of others, or even disregarding others’ welfare and\nmerely making an effort to promote your own. Buddhists would see\negoism as reflecting a damaging lack of perception of the absence of\nself. \nAny interpretation of Buddhist ethics must find room for the\nabsolutely crucial role of intention. There are many contexts in which\nBuddhism seems to emphasize the intention with which an act was\nperformed much more than the benefit or harm that actually resulted.\nOne case often cited is that of Channa, who presented a gift of food\nto the Buddha which gave him dysentery and thus caused his death.\nSince Channa’s intention was to perform a meritorious act of\ngenerosity, the Buddha tells his followers not to condemn Channa;\nsince he did not know that the food was contaminated, he actually\ngained goodness from this action. \nLess dramatically, the amount of good or bad karma generated by an\naction is said to be strongly dependent on the motivation with which\nit was carried out. Thus actions performed out of hatred are more\nkarmically damaging than those performed out of greed. Meanwhile, some\nBuddhist texts seem to say that any action performed with good\nintentions is a good action, whereas any action performed with bad\nintentions is a bad one. These suggestions may support a theoretical\nreconstruction that focuses more on motivation than on\nconsequences. \nAs we will see in Section 6, most forms of Buddhism also take a\nstrongly negative attitude to killing. Sometimes, this opposition is\ntaken to an extent which may be difficult to justify from a\nconsequentialist perspective. Many consequentialist theories, such as\nclassical utilitarianism, notoriously make it much easier to justify\nkilling than it would be on other moral perspectives. The most\nstraightforward application of utilitarianism would imply that it is\nsometimes morally permissible to kill someone when doing so would\nbring about benefits or prevent harms sufficient to outweigh the value\nof the future existence that would otherwise be enjoyed by the person\nto be killed. Many Buddhists, especially in the Theravāda, would\nrecoil from this implication and place a much higher standard on the\njustification of killing, if it can be justified at all. This issue\nposes a significant problem that a consequentialist interpretation\nneeds to solve. \nAnother way of understanding Buddhist ethics is to read it as similar,\nnot to consequentialism, but to virtue ethics. This account was first\nproposed by Damien Keown (in Keown 1992) and has since been followed\nby several scholars. The virtue ethics approach begins from the\nundoubted fact that Buddhist texts devote a great deal of attention to\nwhat kind of people we should strive to be and what virtues we should\nseek to cultivate in ourselves. In this respect, Buddhist ethics may\nseem more similar to the views of ancient Greek thinkers such as\nAristotle than to more modern Western thought. For Aristotle, the goal\nwe should aim at in life is eudaimonia, often translated\n“happiness” or “human flourishing.” This\ncondition of eudaimonia is the good for humans. Keown argues\nthat the role of Nirvana in Theravāda ethics is analogous:\nNirvana is the good. The various abilities and virtues that are\ncultivated on the Buddhist path would then derive their value from\ntheir relation to this good, either as means to attaining Nirvana or\nas constituent aspects of the awakened life. \nOne way to settle the issue between consequentialist and virtue ethics\ninterpretations of Buddhist teachings would be to identify the most\nfundamental aim of the Buddhist worldview. Is it the perfection of the\nindividual’s character, as in virtue ethics, or the welfare of\nall sentient beings, as in universalist, welfarist\nconsequentialism? \nNow on a traditional Buddhist view, the Law of Karma says that those\nof our actions that are intended to harm others will evolve into\nmisery for us, whereas those of our actions that are intended to\nbenefit others will evolve into happiness for us. Moreover, the\nhighest states of well-being we can attain are also characterized by\nlovingkindness and compassion for others. In all or nearly all cases,\nthen, the action that is best for the agent and the action that is\nbest for all beings will coincide, on this view. There is no deep\nconflict between self-interest and morality. \nThis is wonderful, if true, but it makes our theoretical task much\nharder. Should we say that the most fundamental aim of Buddhist\npractice is to benefit all sentient beings everywhere and advance\ntheir welfare, and that it so happens that the most effective way for\neach agent to do this is to work toward her own awakening? Or should\nwe say that the most fundamental aim of practice is the\npractitioner’s own awakening, and that it so happens that\npursuing this aim will turn out to benefit others as well? \nMahāyāna texts are full of passages that focus on the\nimportance of the welfare of all beings and extol those who promote\nthis goal. Therefore, the virtue ethics interpretation appears more\nplausible when applied to the Theravāda than when applied to the\nMahāyāna. And in fact, Keown proposed his account primarily\nin relation to the Theravāda; he offers a rather different\ninterpretation of the Mahāyāna, which in fact involves a\ncertain kind of consequentialism. We should not necessarily assume\nthat all forms of Buddhism have the same structure at the level of\nethical theory. \nIt is possible to construct an interpretation that acknowledges the\ncentral importance of virtue and the cultivation of character in\nBuddhism within an overall framework that is consequentialist. One\napproach is character consequentialism, in which the good consequences\nthat are to be maximized are defined by the welfare of sentient\nbeings, and the welfare of sentient beings is understood to consist in\nboth happiness and virtue. On this view, we have a non-instrumental\nreason to promote the virtue of ourselves and others. (This theory is\ndefended at length in Goodman 2009.) Character consequentialism thus\nrejects hedonism, the view that identifies welfare with happiness, and\nadvances a theory in which the good has two major components. This\napproach allows us to avoid some of the damaging philosophical\nobjections that have been raised against hedonism. But it also creates\nquestions about how to compare the value of greater virtue against the\nvalue of greater happiness, should these considerations ever\nconflict. \nAnother approach is aretaic consequentialism, an indirect form of\nconsequentialism in which the primary objects of evaluation are\ncharacter traits, not actions or rules. This theory tells us to\ndevelop in ourselves those states of character which are conducive to\nthe happiness of sentient beings. (See Siderits 2007, 292–93)\nThis elegant interpretation explains why Buddhist texts so often focus\non character traits, but it also retains a hedonist view of\nwell-being. It allows us to interpret instructions on moral discipline\nnot as inflexible rules, but as advice about what traits of character\nto cultivate. \nHow plausible is it to interpret Buddhist authors as committed to a\nhedonist view of well-being––or indeed, to any view of\nwell-being at all? South Asian Buddhist texts often use terms such as\nartha and hita that plausibly express the same\nconcept as our term “well-being,” so it is reasonable to\nask what account the authors of those texts might have given of what\nthey meant. Given the central importance of the prevention of\nsuffering in Buddhism, as expressed in such teachings as the First\nNoble Truth, it must be true that well-being in Buddhism includes\nfreedom from suffering as, at least, one of its components. Meanwhile,\ngiven the strongly negative Buddhist view of desire, it would not be\nplausible at all to regard Buddhism as holding a desire-fulfillment\ntheory of well-being.  \nHowever, hedonism is not our only interpretive option.\nŚāntideva claims in several passages that the Buddhist\nvirtues work together and reinforce each other. This makes it possible\nto read him as holding a “homeostatic cluster” view of\nwell-being like that of Richard Boyd (see Goodman 2016b, 149-152.)\nThose who defend the analogy between Buddhist ethics and Aristotelian\nvirtue ethics could advance a nature-fulfillment theory as the proper\ninterpretation of well-being in Buddhism. Mark Siderits (2007) rejects\nthis interpretation on the grounds that it conflicts with the doctrine\nof no self, which implies that, ultimately, humans have no nature to\nfulfill. But Christopher Gowans has pointed out that, if we regard\nwell-being as existing at the conventional level of truth, this\nobjection may lose its force (see Gowans 2015, 117).  \nSome scholars, such as Charles Hallisey (1996) and Jay Garfield, have\nconcluded that it is futile and misleading to try to interpret\nBuddhist ethics as a systematic theory fitting into one of the\nrecognized types of ethical theories in the West. Rather, they suggest\nthat Buddhist ethics is pluralist, in that it draws on various kinds\nof moral considerations in different cases, and particularist,\nrejecting the entire enterprise of formulating general moral\nprinciples to cover all cases. This view can easily accommodate\ntextual evidence of various kinds of moral reasoning used by Buddhists\nin different situations. But since the resulting interpretation lacks\nan overarching structure, it has few theoretical resources to\nadjudicate conflicts between different values, and it may become quite\nunclear what the view says about particular difficult cases. \nBuddhist texts say relatively little about metaethics, and attempts to\nconstruct metaethical views that would be consistent with Buddhist\nphilosophical commitments have encountered many difficulties. One\nfascinating recent attempt to provide a metaethics for early Buddhism,\nin the work of Jake Davis (2016 and Forthcoming,) takes statements\nabout what the wise would approve or criticize as indicating the\nsource of ethical normativity. This kind of formulation is frequently\nencountered in canonical texts, as for instance in the Metta\nSutta: “Let them not do the slightest thing that the wise\nwould later reprove.” Buddhists accept that a mind that is calm,\nclear and stable sees the truth more accurately than disturbed,\nfluctuating ordinary consciousness. For Davis, the ethical truth just\nconsists of those normative statements that would be accepted\nunanimously by those whose inner life exhibits, to a sufficient\ndegree, these qualities of mental clarity and insight. Thus, on his\nview, even if the wise would often approve of taking actions that\nwould have valuable consequences, it is not those consequences but the\napproval of the wise that makes those actions morally right. \nThe theoretical structure of Buddhist ethics is a subject of\ncontinuing research and debate among a number of scholars, and further\ndevelopments are likely in our understanding of this field. \nBuddhist texts contain a large number of enigmatic statements, of\nvarious different types, seemingly to the effect that once a\npractitioner reaches a sufficiently advanced stage of spiritual\ndevelopment, moral discipline is no longer necessary. These statements\nhave been interpreted in dramatically different ways by various Asian\ntraditions, and Western scholars disagree about how we should\nunderstand them. \nThe Pāli Canon contains the claim that Saints have\n“abandoned goodness (puñña) and vile\nactions (pāpa).” Some writers have interpreted\nthis statement as meaning that ethical norms no longer apply to\nSaints. But Damien Keown has argued quite convincingly against this\ninterpretation (1992, ch. 4). “Goodness” and “vile\nactions” refer to actions which have karmic effects in the\nfuture, projecting a future existence that includes happiness or\nsuffering, respectively. Since the life in which one becomes a Saint\nis one’s last life, it is impossible that any actions that occur\nafter Sainthood is attained could project future existence through\nkarma. The change which stops the accumulation of karma is most\nplausibly identified as the abandonment of clinging to the belief in a\nsubstantial self. Someone who no longer thinks of actions as stemming\nfrom and having effects on a real, persisting self is no longer\ntrapped in cyclic existence. \nTheravāda texts contain intriguing suggestions that Saints no\nlonger have to worry about following rules of moral discipline; they\njust spontaneously act in appropriate ways. But there are also\nstatements in Theravāda texts to the effect that a Saint would\nnever knowingly and intentionally break any of the rules of monastic\ndiscipline. These rules forbid many actions which the Buddhist\ntradition regards as reprehensible merely by convention, such as\neating after noon. If someone has not taken a vow that prohibits\neating after noon, then doing so is not wrong: the wrongness of the\naction stems merely from the fact that it infringes a valuable system\nof discipline that the agent has chosen to undertake. If Saints just\nact spontaneously and aren’t psychologically bound by rules,\nit’s not clear why they would, in all circumstances, avoid\nactions which are wrong merely because they are forbidden by rules of\nmonastic discipline. There seems to be a serious tension here. \nWriters expounding Mahāyāna ethics face somewhat similar\nissues, but handle them rather differently. According to\nMahāyāna philosophers such as Asaṅga and\nŚāntideva, an advanced practitioner who is motivated by\ncompassion may sometimes see that an action which is forbidden by the\nusual rules of Buddhist moral discipline would actually be more\neffective at preventing suffering and promoting happiness than any\naction the rules would permit. Under such circumstances, that\npractitioner can permissibly break the rules out of compassion. \nFor example, Asaṅga tells us that it would be permissible to\ntell a lie to save another sentient being from being killed or\nseriously harmed. If someone takes up with bad friends, it would be\npermissible to criticize those friends to him, a case of divisive\nspeech, in order to protect him from being corrupted by them. It would\nbe permissible to overthrow a wicked king or remove a corrupt temple\nadministrator from office. If a thief steals items belonging to the\nmonastic community, it would be permissible to steal them back in\norder to protect him from the severe bad karma of consuming those\nitems. In fact, if a bandit is planning to murder a large number of\nspiritually advanced beings, it would be permissible to kill the\nbandit preemptively, thus saving him from the terrible torment of\naeons in the hells. In all such cases, according to Asaṅga,\nthese acts, if done with the right kind of motivation, would result in\nmuch merit for the one who carries them out. (Tatz trans. 1986,\n70–73) \nOne thing that many of these cases seem to have in common is that the\nrule-violating action proceeds from a compassion that includes in its\nscope not only the potential victims of the harms that are to be\nprevented, but also the perpetrator of those harms. When people hear\nof the Buddhist commitment to nonviolence, one question they often ask\nis whether someone with foreknowledge of the events of the 1940s would\nbe permitted by Buddhist principles to assassinate Hitler in 1930. If\nwe follow Asaṅga, the answer would seem to be: yes, you may kill\nHitler, if you have compassion for him and you do it partly for his\nsake. Thus, in extreme cases, violence may be permissible; but hatred\nis never justified. \nOne way to understand Asaṅga’s view here would be to\nimagine that one of your loved ones, such as your brother or son, is\nslipped a drug which makes him temporarily insane, and he then attacks\nyou with a knife. To remain passive and let him kill you would not be\nthe best thing you could do for him. If you are able to knock him\ndown, take the knife away and restrain him, you thereby protect him\nfrom a lifetime of regret and distress resulting from having killed\nyou. This use of coercive force would therefore naturally flow from\nyour love for him. \nIn addition to particular examples of permissible violations of the\nrules of moral discipline, both Asaṅga and Śāntideva\ngive us general statements about when the rules should be broken.\nThese statements are strikingly consequentialist in flavor. Thus\nAsaṅga tells us this: “If the bodhisattva sees that some\ncaustic means, some use of severity would be of benefit to sentient\nbeings, and does not employ it in order to guard against unhappiness,\nhe is possessed of fault, possessed of contradiction; there is fault\nthat is not defiled” (Tatz trans., 1986, 76).\nŚāntideva’s view is similar; he writes:\n“Realizing this, one should always be striving for others’\nwell-being. Even what is proscribed is permitted for a compassionate\nperson who sees it will be of benefit.” (Crosby and Skilton\ntrans., 1995, 41). According to these statements, an agent who is\ntruly motivated by compassion can break the usually applicable rules\nof moral discipline whenever doing so would benefit those involved in\nthe situation. \nSeveral Mahāyāna texts, then, allow for certain cases in\nwhich advanced practitioners may violate the rules of moral\ndiscipline. Texts from the Vajrayāna, or Tantric, traditions of\nBuddhism go further than this. Revered Tantric masters such as\nNāropa, Kukkurīpa, and Padmasambhava are shown engaging in\nshocking actions that flagrantly violate the conventions of society\nand the rules of Buddhist moral discipline. But these stories do not\nnecessarily mean that the Vajrayāna rejects all forms of ethics.\nNumerous texts make it clear that even as they break the rules,\nTantric adepts are motivated by compassion for all sentient beings.\nThey see that given the situation, unconventional and even grotesque\nactions are the most effective means to bring about the welfare of\nothers. Since they are totally free of all bonds of ideology or social\nconditioning, they spontaneously do what will be best on the whole,\nwithout worrying about what others might think or what the rulebook\nmight say. They have transcended moral discipline completely, while\nremaining, in a deeper sense, ethical exemplars. \nLike several other Asian traditions, Buddhism does not regard humans\nas fundamentally different from other animals. Through the process of\nrebirth, what is in some sense the same entity can be a human now, but\nan animal in the past and in the future. One consequence of this claim\nis that any animal you meet is likely to have been a human at one\ntime, and may even have been your own mother in a previous life.\nMoreover, animals are seen as just as capable of suffering as humans\nare; they are also appropriate objects of the emotions of compassion,\nlovingkindness and equanimity. Thus we have powerful reasons not to\ncause them unnecessary suffering and to refrain from harming or\nkilling them. \nThough animals are sentient beings and possess consciousness, just as\nhumans do, there is one reason why human lives are more precious than\nanimal lives. Only in a human body can one attain awakening; in an\nanimal body, this is not possible. Therefore, Buddhists maintain that\nit is worse to kill a human than to kill an animal. \nThough all Buddhist traditions attach moral significance to animal\nlife and animal suffering, not all Buddhists practice vegetarianism.\nFor example, Theravāda monks, who live by begging, are expected\nto eat whatever food is placed in their bowl, including meat, without\npreference or discrimination. However, they are forbidden to eat meat\nfrom an animal if they have seen, heard, or suspected that the animal\nin question was killed specifically for them. \nThe Tibetan plateau is at a high altitude and has a very cold, dry\nclimate. Over much of Tibet, the only form of food production possible\nis nomadic pastoralism, with sheep and yaks as the major sources of\nfood. Moreover, under premodern conditions, and given the cold\nweather, people living in Tibet needed to eat calorie-dense food in\norder to survive. A strict vegetarianism was therefore quite\nimpractical. As a result, many Tibetans came to accept meat eating as\na necessary part of their lifestyle. Today, however, with more\nvegetarian food options available and with many Tibetans living in\nexile, important spiritual leaders in the Tibetan tradition have begun\nto advocate a switch to a vegetarian diet. \nSome sources in the Buddhist tradition hold that it is worse to kill\nan animal yourself than to eat the meat of an animal someone else has\nkilled. Many faithful Buddhists go to great lengths not to kill\nanimals. Moreover, the professions of hunting and fishing are\nclassified as “wrong livelihood,” and Buddhists are\nexpected not to follow them. In majority Buddhist countries, butchers\nare often members of non-Buddhist religious minorities. \nBefore the time of the historical Buddha, animal sacrifice was an\nimportant part of Indian religious practice. The Buddha expressed his\nunqualified opposition to animal sacrifice, holding that far from\ncreating religious merit, it would only produce bad karma for those\nengaged in it. As a result of his teachings, along with those of\nMahāvīra, the founder of Jainism, ideals of nonviolence\nbecame more prevalent in India, and animal sacrifice declined rapidly\nin frequency and prestige. Among a few marginal Buddhist or\nquasi-Buddhist groups in the Himalayas, animal sacrifice is still\npracticed today; but Buddhist monastic institutions have fairly\nconsistently opposed the killing of animals for religious\npurposes. \nMost Buddhist texts hold that plants are not sentient beings and do\nnot have moral status in and of themselves. Although a few scattered\nsources suggest that plants might be sentient, the mainstream of the\ntradition sees it as morally unproblematic in itself to use, kill, or\neat plants. However, since animals depend on plants, there are\nsometimes instrumental reasons to protect plants for the sake of\nanimal welfare. We do find guidance, for example, to be careful in\ncutting down trees to refrain from harming the animals who live in and\naround them. In Southeast Asia, some Buddhist monks have been very\nactive in protecting forests from logging. \nBuddhism does not see a great gulf between humans and non-human\nanimals, as some adherents of Western religions do; the suffering of\nanimals is morally significant, just like the suffering of humans.\nMoreover, Buddhist theories of causality stress that things arise in\ndependence on a diverse collection of causes and conditions, implying\nthat human life is interdependent in complex ways with other forms of\nlife on Earth. And as mentioned above, the cultivation of\nlovingkindness and compassion for all sentient beings is an important\npart of most systems of Buddhist meditation practice. As a result of\nthese teachings, many contemporary Buddhists, especially in the West,\nplace great value on ecological awareness and environmental\nsustainability. They seek to develop a way of life for humanity that\nsupports spiritual practice and can coexist in harmony with the\nnon-human animals who share our planet. \nThe Buddhist tradition generally sees war and violence as deeply\nmorally problematic. War is seen as tragic and typically unnecessary,\nand the position of a soldier is seen as highly karmically dangerous.\nViolence directly causes harm and suffering to sentient beings,\npollutes the minds of those who use it, and creates cycles of hatred\nand retribution that can inflict terrible damage, both physical and\npsychological. \nIn general, the Buddhist attitude toward violence is expressed in\nverses X. 1–2 of the Dhammapada: \nThe phrase translated “feeling for others as for yourself”\nis the Pāli attānaṃ upamaṃ\nkatvā, which might be more literally rendered as\n“having made an analogy with oneself.” Here a form of\nmoral reasoning is used that is quite similar to the Golden Rule:\nimaginatively put yourself in the place of others, and you will see\nthat certain ways of treating them are morally impermissible. The\nDhammapada also tells us: \nBuddhists explicitly reject the Hindu teaching that a soldier in a\njust war will be reborn in a heavenly realm. Instead, Buddhists hold\nthat those who die in battle are likely to be reborn as animals or in\nthe hells, especially if they die with a feeling of anger or hatred\ntoward the soldiers on the other side. In his commentary on the\nFour Hundred Stanzas (Catuḥśataka) of\nĀryadeva, Candrakīrti expresses a very low opinion of those\nwho give their lives in battle for their king and country: “In\nthis world people who give up all of their possessions for gambling,\nliquor, and prostitutes are not entitled to respect. Virtuous-minded\npeople do not honor the sacrifice of these people, since they pursue\nan addiction. In the same way, the sacrifice of life in battle should\nnot be respected, since this is the basis for harmful actions”\n(Lang trans., 2003, 200). He also criticizes the view that kings may\npermissibly engage in warfare, and offers what looks like a general\nstatement of pacifism: “a sage is inferior when his treatises\nexplain violence as virtuous behavior. A mediocre sage has doubts:\n‘it may be so or it may not be so.’ A superior sage does\nnot regard violence as virtuous behavior” (Lang trans., 2003,\n197). \nBuddhist monks, especially in the Theravāda tradition, are\nexpected to practice a strict form of non-violence; they should prefer\nbeing killed to killing others, and should even practice\nlovingkindness and compassion toward those who harm them or their\nfamilies. The Buddha himself is said to have mediated a dispute over\nwater rights between two neighboring kingdoms, preventing it from\nescalating into an armed conflict. In troubled times, Buddhist monks\nhave often sought opportunities to bring about peace and the\nresolution of conflict through dialogue. Normative Buddhist texts\npraise the role of peacemaker and an attitude of impartial benevolence\ntoward all parties to a conflict (see, e.g., Thurman trans. 2000, 70).\nThe Buddhist attitude toward war is thus quite negative, and passages\nglorifying military victory or sanitizing the realities of warfare are\nhard to find in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist texts. \nNevertheless, the common perception of Buddhism as a whole as an\nunequivocally pacifist tradition is questionable. Many forms of\nBuddhism have arrived at the position that in rare cases, war may be\nnecessary. \nOne way that Buddhist ethical theory might be used, in certain extreme\ncases, to justify war relies on Asaṅga’s account of\njustifiable killing, discussed in section 4 above. For example, if the\nofficials of a militarily powerful state, monitoring the situation in\na small developing country, see that a genocide has begun to take\nplace there, they might reflect that those who are now committing\ngenocide are not only causing terrible harm to their victims, but also\naccumulating severe negative karma for themselves. These officials\nmight decide to intervene to stop the genocide, motivated by\ncompassion for everyone involved, including the killers. If they are\nsincerely motivated in this way, Mahāyāna Buddhists might\nsee their actions as acceptable, even if they involved using military\nforce and killing many people, because less suffering would result and\nthe overall consequences would therefore be much better. \nAs Stephen Jenkins has shown in an important recent article, a number\nof influential Mahāyāna texts provide arguments of this\ngeneral type. Both Candrakīrti and Nāgārjuna offer the\nexample “of a physician, certainly one of the most important and\npervasive metaphors for a bodhisattva, amputating a finger that has\nbeen bitten by a poisonous snake, thus preventing the spread of\ngreater suffering” (Jenkins 2011, 12). Candrakīrti then\ndevelops this theme through another example, \nSeveral Mahāyāna scriptures also contain statements\ninconsistent with an unqualified pacifism. For instance, the\nMahā-parinirvāṇa Sūtra states that it is\npermissible for someone with a pure intention to kill those who\npersecute Buddhism (Jenkins 2011, 18). Another scriptural text, the\nRange of the Bodhisattva\n(ārya-bodhisattva-gocara), explicitly endorses defensive\nwarfare, when carried out with strict limitations and in order to\nprotect the people: \nIn practice, Buddhist societies have not always refrained from war.\nFor example, between 1635 and 1642, the Mongol leader Gushri Khan\ninvaded Tibet, suppressed various warring factions, and placed supreme\npolitical power over the region in the hands of the dGe lugs tradition\nand its leader, His Holiness the Fifth Dalai Lama. In the Song of\nthe Queen of Spring, a text published in 1643, the Fifth Dalai\nLama describes Gushri Khan as an emanation of the great Bodhisattva\nVajrapāni, and justifies his warlike actions as motivated by\ncompassion (Maher 2008, 186–90). In Sri Lanka, Buddhist monks\nand rulers have endorsed the use of military force to defend their\nisland, seen as a sacred land and a sanctuary for the Buddhist\nreligion, against Hindu invaders from South India. During the recent\ncivil war, similar justifications were used to defend the use of\nmilitary measures against separatist rebels, mostly Hindus belonging\nto the Tamil minority. In general, Buddhist kings in many parts of the\nworld, including Southeast and Central Asia, have called on their\nmilitary forces to resist foreign invasions. \nBuddhist discussions of the ethics of punishment are fairly rare, but\nthere is an important passage about punishment in the Precious Garland\n(Ratnāvalī), a letter to a king from the great\nBuddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna. Whether or not Buddhist\nethics in general is consequentialist, the theory of punishment\nNāgārjuna presents is clearly a consequentialist one. To\nmaintain social order, punishment is a regrettable necessity. But the\nking should not punish out of anger or a desire for revenge. Instead,\nhe should inflict punishment out of compassion, especially compassion\nfor the criminals themselves, whose destructive actions may have\ncondemned them to many lifetimes of suffering. (See Hopkins 1998 for a\ntranslation of the text and Goodman 2009, ch. 9, for discussion.) \nMoreover, punishment should be as mild as is consistent with achieving\nthe goal of restraining crime. Prisoners should be treated well and\nheld under humane conditions. Moreover, those prisoners who are\nphysically weak, and therefore pose less danger to society, should be\nreleased early. It’s fairly clear that Nāgārjuna would\nreject retributivist theories of punishment, which hold that prisoners\nshould be punished because they deserve to suffer or in order to take\naway any unjust advantage they may have gained by their actions. From\nthe point of view of retributivism, the physical strength or weakness\nof prisoners is irrelevant to how much punishment they deserve.\nMoreover, some forms of retributivism, especially cruder, popular\nversions, would endorse harsh conditions of punishment in order to\nensure that prisoners have to undergo the degree of suffering that\nthey deserve. \nJust as Asaṅga’s theory can be used to justify certain\nkinds of military action, it could also help justify punishment.\nPunishment can have a number of beneficial effects: it can\nincapacitate criminals, physically preventing them from repeating\ntheir crimes; it can deter criminals, inducing them to follow the law\nfrom fear of further punishment; it can rehabilitate criminals by\ngiving them education and skills that provide them with better options\nthan a life of crime; sometimes, it can even reform criminals, helping\nthem change their character to become better people, so that they will\nno longer wish to commit crimes. These good effects of punishment\nbenefit society, since they reduce the crime rate; but from a Buddhist\npoint of view, they also benefit criminals themselves by preventing\nthem from creating more bad karma. Thus punishment can be motivated by\ncompassion for both criminals and their victims, and so it could be\nacceptable in Buddhist ethics. \nSome people see Buddhism as maintaining unqualified pacifism and\nrejecting violence completely in general. In fact, some Buddhist\nscriptures and treatises do allow for extreme cases in which\ncompassionately motivated punishment, violence, and even war could be\njustified. They reserve their unqualified opposition for the reactive\nemotions that often lead to violence, such as anger, hatred, malice,\nand the desire for revenge. Buddhists should cultivate lovingkindness\nand compassion for everyone, even those guilty of the worst actions,\nand even while recognizing that some people need to be forcibly\nrestrained from doing even more damage. In a world that has been so\nterribly scarred by violence and cruelty, the Buddhist rejection of\nmost forms of warfare seems wise and appropriate. But in a complicated\nworld of difficult choices, allowing for the necessity of violence in\nrare instances may be difficult to avoid. \nThere is considerable controversy about the moral status of abortion\nin Buddhist ethics, with the majority of writers taking a pro-life\nposition. The basic premise of the traditional understanding of\nabortion in Buddhism is that reincarnation is a discrete event which\nhappens at the time of conception. This claim can be found in\ndiscussions of reincarnation in prestigious sources such as the\nTreasury of Metaphysics (Abhidharma-kośa) of\nVasubandhu. It implies that an embryo, even during the first week of\npregnancy, is a human being. As discussed in section 5, what is\ndistinctively valuable about human life is the possibility of\nawakening. When the life of a fetus is taken through abortion, this\npossibility is foreclosed. It follows that abortion is seriously\nwrong, almost as serious as the deliberate murder of an adult. This is\nthe view of most Buddhists on the mainland of Asia today. \nIt’s important to keep in mind that the technological and social\ncontext of abortion has changed dramatically since the time when the\nPāli Canon was composed. Today, a woman might be informed by her\ndoctor that the fetus she is carrying suffers from a severe genetic\nabnormality; if she gives birth, her baby will live for a few days or\na few months in great pain before its inevitable early death. At the\ntime of the Buddha, medical technology was obviously far too\nundeveloped to make such a situation possible. In the Pāli Canon,\nmany of the cases that involve abortion relate to a woman in a\npolygamous marriage who is jealous of her co-wife’s pregnancy\nand wishes to cause her rival to miscarry. Buddhist teachers who\nformulated a blanket prohibition on abortion with this latter type of\ncase in mind might reconsider if they were aware of the former type of\ncase. \nUnlike some other world religions, Buddhism does not have any moral\nobjection to contraception. Thus Buddhists could easily agree to\nsupport programs to reduce the need for abortion by making\ncontraception more widely available and educating people in its\nuse. \nSome Buddhists might question the premise that a human being exists\nfrom the time of conception onward. Some Buddhists in the contemporary\nWest do not read the traditional teachings about reincarnation\nliterally, and so would not have reason to accept that reincarnation\nhappens at the moment of conception. Moreover, there are scientific\nreasons to believe that consciousness does not begin until at least\nthe twentieth week of pregnancy (McMahan 2002, 267). There can be no\nreincarnation without consciousness. If we want both to believe in\nreincarnation and to accept what science tells us about the physical\nbases of consciousness, we should perhaps hold that reincarnation is a\ngradual process that slowly brings about a new conscious being that is\nconnected with one who has recently died. This concept of a gradual\nbeginning of life may be counterintuitive in some respects, but it\nharmonizes well with the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of no self. If\nwe accept this understanding, then early abortion would not constitute\nkilling a sentient being. \nDespite these counterarguments, most Buddhists today would accept\nthat, in their ethical system, abortion is morally wrong. It does not\nnecessarily follow that they would advocate making abortion illegal.\nIn many ways, it is contrary to the spirit of Buddhism to impose\nBuddhist values on others by force. Buddhists were early advocates of\nreligious toleration, and the political environment of India before\nthe Islamic invasions was mostly quite a tolerant one in practice.\nMoreover, Buddhist states have usually not chosen to prohibit such\npractices as slaughtering and eating animals, even when their rulers\nhave held that these practices are immoral. Some writers have argued\nthat due to the severity of the offense of killing a human, abortion\nin particular should not be legally tolerated by Buddhist societies\n(for example, see Harvey 2000, 342–350). In fact, in some\nBuddhist countries, such as Japan, abortion is legal; in others, it is\ntechnically illegal, but the law is not strictly enforced. In a\ndiverse society where the moral status of fetuses is controversial, a\nstrict prohibition on abortion is likely to be difficult and costly to\nenforce, and doing so would lead to intense social controversy,\nalienating people from their own government. The inevitable use of\ncoercion and violence in law enforcement, in the form of police and\nprisons, itself represents a grave karmic cost of imposing any penal\nlaw on segments of the population who do not accept it as legitimate.\nThus many of the reasons internal to the Buddhist tradition that could\nbe used to argue in favor of religious toleration would also seem to\nsupport a legal regime that permits abortion, even if Buddhist ethical\nviews imply that abortion is wrong. \nThe Buddhist tradition is less strongly opposed to suicide than some\nother world religions. For a young, healthy person to complete suicide\nis seen unequivocally as a destructive action. Yet the texts have a\nperspective of greater ambivalence and complexity toward the suicide\nof the gravely ill. Nevertheless, since the overall outlook of their\nreligion encourages Buddhists to value life and oppose killing, they\ntend to be quite concerned about the moral status of euthanasia and\nassisted suicide. \nTraditional Buddhist beliefs imply that to die mindfully, with full\nawareness of the processes of death, is a powerful spiritual practice.\nThe vivid, direct experience of impermanence and the strong sense of\nnon-attachment that result from dying this way could contribute\nprofoundly to the spiritual progress of that person in future lives.\nThis consideration motivates some Buddhists to allow death to take its\nnatural course, neither hastening it through suicide nor putting it\noff briefly through desperate measures of little benefit. Those who\nlack the needed depth of spiritual training may not be able to die\nmindfully, and therefore may be better candidates for aggressive\nmedical intervention to prolong life. Even for them, though, the\nchaos, excitement, confusion and fear of dying in the midst of\naggressive medical intervention may increase the risk of an\nunfavorable rebirth. If the intervention promises no more than a\nchance of a few more hours or days of life, with no hope of a genuine\nrecovery, those who believe in future lives may see it as a poor\noption. \nThe very strong emphasis on the relief of suffering we find in\nBuddhist ethics might lead us to conclude that Buddhists should favor\nassisted suicide or euthanasia when a patient is in severe pain, wants\nto die, but is unable to complete suicide due to physical limitations.\nA doctor who carries out such procedures, though, even with the\nconsent of the patients involved, is in a karmically perilous\nposition. If the doctor’s motives for killing terminal patients\nare in any way impure, the karmic consequences could be very serious.\nThe same applies to family members who cause the death of their\nrelative while motivated, even in part, by greed or by dislike of that\nperson. \nFor more information on these issues, see the detailed and helpful\ndiscussion by Peter Harvey (Harvey 2000, 286–310). The questions\nof euthanasia and assisted suicide involve several important Buddhist\nvalues which may be in tension with each other. In looking at these\nmatters from a Buddhist perspective, we are unlikely to find any easy\nanswers.","contact.mail":"cgoodman@binghamton.edu","contact.domain":"binghamton.edu"}]
