The existence of the other worlds makes it\npossible to remove randomness and action at a distance from quantum\ntheory and thus from all physics. \n\n\n\nThe fundamental idea of the MWI, going back to\n Everett 1957,\n is that there are myriads of worlds in the Universe in addition to\nthe world we are aware of. In particular, every time a quantum\nexperiment with different possible outcomes is\nperformed, all outcomes are obtained, each in a different world, even\nif we are only aware of the world with the outcome we have seen. In\nfact, quantum experiments take place everywhere and very often, not\njust in physics laboratories: even the irregular blinking of an old\nfluorescent bulb is a quantum experiment. \n There are numerous variations and reinterpretations of the original\nEverett proposal, most of which are briefly discussed in the entry on\n Everett's relative state formulation of quantum mechanics.\n Here, a particular approach to the MWI (which differs from the\npopular “actual splitting worlds” approach in\n De Witt 1970)\n will be presented in detail, followed by a discussion relevant for\nmany variants of the MWI. \n The MWI consists of two parts: \n\nPart (i) is essentially summarized by the Schrödinger equation\nor its relativistic generalization. It is a rigorous mathematical\ntheory and is not problematic philosophically. Part (ii) involves\n“our experiences” which do not have a rigorous definition.  An\nadditional difficulty in setting up (ii) follows from the fact that\nhuman languages were developed at a time when people did not suspect\nthe existence of parallel worlds. \nThe mathematical part of the MWI, (i), yields less than mathematical\nparts of some other theories such as, e.g.,\n Bohmian mechanics.  The Schrödinger\nequation itself does not explain why we experience definite results in\nquantum measurements. In contrast, in Bohmian mechanics the\nmathematical part yields almost everything, and the analog of (ii) is\nvery simple: it is the postulate according to which only the “Bohmian\npositions” (and not the quantum wave) correspond to our\nexperience. The Bohmian positions of all particles yield the familiar\npicture of the (single) world we are aware of. Thus, philosophically,\na theory like Bohmian mechanics achieves more than the MWI, but at\nthe price of adding the non-local dynamics of Bohmian particle\npositions.\n \n\nThe concept of a “world” in the MWI belongs to part (ii) of the theory,\ni.e., it is not a rigorously defined mathematical entity, but a term\ndefined by us (sentient beings) in describing our experience. When we\nrefer to the “definite classically described state” of, say, a cat,\nit means that the position and the state (alive, dead, smiling, etc.)\nof the cat is maximally specified according to our ability to\ndistinguish between the alternatives, and that this specification\ncorresponds to a classical picture, e.g., no superpositions of dead\nand alive cats are allowed in a single\n world. \n Another concept, which is closer to Everett's original proposal, see\n Saunders 1995,\n is that of a relative, or perspectival world defined for every physical\nsystem and every one of its states (provided it is a state of\nnon-zero probability): I will call it a centered world. This\nconcept is useful when a world is centered on a perceptual state of a\nsentient being. In this world, all objects which the sentient being\nperceives have definite states, but objects that are not under\nobservation might be in a superposition of different (classical)\nstates. The advantage of a centered world is that a quantum phenomenon\nin a distant galaxy does not split it, while the advantage of the\ndefinition presented here is that we can consider a world without\nspecifying a center, and in particular our usual language is just as\nuseful for describing worlds that existed at times when there were no\nsentient beings.   \nThe concept of a world in the MWI is based on the layman's\nconception of a world; however, several features are different.\nObviously, the definition of the world as everything that\nexists does not hold in the MWI. “Everything that exists” is the\nUniverse, and there is only one Universe. The Universe incorporates\nmany worlds similar to the one the layman is familiar with.\nA layman believes that our present world has a unique past and\nfuture. According to the MWI, a world defined at some moment of time\ncorresponds to a unique world at a time in the past, but to a\nmultitude of worlds at a time in the future.\n \n“I” am an object, such as the Earth, a cat,\netc. “I” is defined at a particular time by a complete\n(classical) description of the state of my body and of my\nbrain. “I” and “Lev” do not refer to the same\nthings (even though my name is Lev). At the present moment there are\nmany different “Lev”s in different worlds (not more than\none in each world), but it is meaningless to say that now there is\nanother “I”. I have a particular, well defined past: I\ncorrespond to a particular “Lev” in 2012, but not to a\nparticular “Lev” in the future: I correspond to a\nmultitude of “Lev”s in 2022. In the framework of the MWI\nit is meaningless to ask: Which Lev in 2022 will I be? I will\ncorrespond to them all. Every time I perform a quantum experiment\n(with several possible results) it only seems to me that I obtain a\nsingle definite result. Indeed, Lev who obtains this particular result\nthinks this way.  However, this Lev cannot be identified as the only\nLev after the experiment. Lev before the experiment corresponds to all\n“Lev”s obtaining all possible results.\n \n Although this approach to the concept\nof personal identity seems somewhat unusual, it is plausible in the\nlight of the critique of personal identity by\n Parfit 1986.\n Parfit considers some artificial situations in which a person splits\ninto several copies, and argues that there is no good answer to the\nquestion: Which copy is me? He concludes that personal identity is\nnot what matters when I divide.\nSaunders and Wallace 2008a  argue that based\non the semantics of Lewis 1986 one can find a\nmeaning for this question. However, in their reply\n  2008b  to\n Tappenden 2008 \nthey emphasise that their work is not about the nature of ‘I’, but\nabout “serviceability”. Indeed, as it will be explained below, I\nshould behave as if “Which copy is me?” is a legitimate question.\n We should not expect to have a detailed and complete explanation of\nour experience in terms of the wave function of 1033\nparticles that we and our immediate environment are made of. We just\nhave to be able to draw a basic picture which is free of paradoxes.\nThere are many attempts to provide an explanation of what we see based\non the MWI or its variants in\n Lockwood 1989,\n Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990,\n Albert 1992,\n Saunders 1993,\n Penrose 1994,\n Chalmers 1996,\n Deutsch 1996,\n Joos et al. 2003,\n Schlosshauer 2007,\n Zurek  2009, and\n Wallace 2012.\n A sketch of the connection between the wave function of the Universe\n and our experience follows.\n   The basis for the correspondence between the quantum state (the wave\nfunction) of the Universe and our experience is the description that\nphysicists give in the framework of standard quantum theory for objects\ncomposed of elementary particles. Elementary particles of the same kind\nare identical. Therefore, the essence of an object is the quantum state\nof its particles and not the particles themselves (see the elaborate\ndiscussion in the entry on\n identity and individuality in quantum theory):\n one quantum state of a set of elementary particles might be a cat\nand another state of the same particles might be a small\ntable. Clearly, we cannot now write down an exact wave function of a\ncat. We know, to a reasonable approximation, the wave function of\nsome elementary particles that constitute a nucleon. The wave\nfunction of the electrons and the nucleons that together make up an\natom is known with even better precision. The wave functions of\nmolecules (i.e. the wave functions of the ions and electrons out of\nwhich molecules are built) are well studied. A lot is known about\nbiological cells, so physicists can write down a rough form of the\nquantum state of a cell. Out of cells we construct various tissues and\nthen the whole body of a cat or a table. So, let us denote the\nquantum state constructed in this way\n|Ψ›OBJECT.\n \n In our construction\n |Ψ›OBJECT\n is the quantum state of an object in a definite state and\n position.\n According to the definition of a world we have adopted, in each\nworld the cat is in a definite state: either alive or dead.\nSchrödinger's experiment with the cat leads to a splitting\nof worlds even before opening the box. Only in the alternative\napproach is Schrödinger's cat, which is in a superposition\nof being alive and dead, a member of the (single) centered world of\nthe observer before she opens the sealed box with the cat (the\nobserver perceives directly the facts related to the preparation of\nthe experiment and she deduces that the cat is in a superposition).\n \nFormally, the quantum state of an object which consists of N \nparticles is defined in 3N dimensional configuration space.\nHowever, in order to make a connection to our experience it is crucial\nto understand the quantum state as an entangled wave function of\nN particles in 3 dimensional space. Physical\ninteractions are local in 3 dimensions and we only experience\nobjects defined in 3-space. The density of the wave function of\nmolecules of the macroscopic object in 3-space is the bridge between\nthe wave function of the object and our experience of that\nobject. This concept, which is a property of the wave function only,\nplays the role of the primitive ontology present in other\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics,\n Allori et al. 2014.\n \nThe wave function of all particles in the Universe corresponding to any\nparticular world will be a product of the states of the sets of particles\ncorresponding to all objects in the world multiplied by the quantum\nstate\n|Φ›\n of all the particles that do not constitute “objects”. Within a\nworld, “objects” have definite macroscopic states by\n fiat: The product state is only for variables which are relevant for the\nmacroscopic description of the objects. There might be some\nentanglement between weakly coupled variables like nuclear spins\nbelonging to different objects. In order to keep the form of the\nquantum state of the world (1), the quantum state of such variables\nshould belong to |Φ›. \nConsider a text-book description of quantum measurements based on the\nvon Neumann 1955 approach according to which each\nquantum measurement ends up with the collapse of the wave function to\nthe eigenstate of the measured variable.  The quantum measurement\ndevice must be a macroscopic object with macroscopically different\nstates corresponding to different outcomes. In this case, the MWI\nall-particles wave function corresponding to a world with a particular\noutcome is the same as in the von Neumann theory provided there is a\ncollapse to the wave function with this outcome. \n Von Neumann 1955 \nanalysis helps in understanding the correspondence\nbetween the wave function and our perception of the world. However, as\nBecker 2004 explains, the status of the wave\nfunction for von Neumann is not ontological as in the MWI described\nhere, but epistemic: it summarises information about the results of\nmeasurements.\n \nIn most situations, only macroscopic objects are relevant to our\nexperience. However, today's technology has reached a point in which\ninterference experiments are performed with single particles. In such\nsituations a description of a world with states of only macroscopic\nobjects, such as sources and detectors, is possible but cumbersome.\nHence it is fruitful to add a description of microscopic objects.\n Vaidman 2010 argues that the proper way to describe\nthe relevant microscopic particles is by the two-state vector which\nconsists of the usual, forward evolving state specified by the\nmeasurement in the past and a backward evolving state specified by the\nmeasurement in the future. Such a description provides a simple\nexplanation of the weak trace the particles leave, Vaidman 2013.\n \nThe quantum state of the Universe can be decomposed into a\nsuperposition of terms corresponding to different worlds:\n  \nDifferent worlds correspond to different classically described\nstates of at least one object. Different classically described states\ncorrespond to orthogonal quantum states. Therefore, different worlds\ncorrespond to orthogonal states: all states\n  |ΨWORLD i›\n are mutually orthogonal and\n consequently,\n ∑|αi| 2 = 1. \n\nThe construction of the quantum state of the Universe in terms of the\nquantum states of objects presented above is only approximate; it is\ngood only for all practical purposes (FAPP). Indeed, the\nconcept of an object itself has no rigorous definition: should a mouse\nthat a cat just swallowed be considered as a part of the cat? The\nconcept of a “definite position” is also only\napproximately defined: how far should a cat be displaced in order for\nit to be considered to be in a different position? If the displacement\nis much smaller than the quantum uncertainty, it must be considered to\nbe in the same place, because in this case the quantum state of the\ncat is almost the same and the displacement is undetectable in\nprinciple. But this is only an absolute bound, because our ability to\ndistinguish various locations of the cat is far from this quantum\nlimit. Furthermore, the state of an object (e.g. alive or dead) is\nmeaningful only if the object is considered for a period of time. In\nour construction, however, the quantum state of an object is defined\nat a particular time. In fact, we have to ensure that the quantum\nstate will have the shape of the object not only at that time, but for\nsome period of time. Splitting of the world during this period of time\nis another source of ambiguity because\nthere is no precise definition of when the splitting occurs. The time\nof splitting corresponds to the time of the collapse in the approach given by\n von Neumann 1955. He provided a very extensive\ndiscussion showing that it does not matter when exactly the collapse\noccurs, and this analysis shows also that it does not matter when the\nsplitting in the MWI occurs. \n\nThe reason that it is possible to propose only an approximate\nprescription for the correspondence between the quantum state of the\nUniverse and our experience is essentially the same as the reason that led\n Bell 1990\nto claim that “ordinary quantum mechanics\nis just fine FAPP”. The concepts we use: “object”,\n“measurement”, etc. are not rigorously defined. Bell and\nmany others were looking (until now in vain) for a “precise\nquantum mechanics”. Since it is not enough for a physical theory\nto be just fine FAPP, a quantum mechanics needs rigorous foundations.\nIndeed, the MWI has rigorous foundations for (i), the “physics\npart” of the theory; only part (ii), the correspondence with our\nexperience, is approximate (just fine FAPP). But “just fine\nFAPP” means that the theory explains our experience for any\npossible experiment, and this is the goal of (ii). See\n Wallace 2002, 2010a for more\narguments why a FAPP definition of a world is enough. \nThe mathematical structure of the theory (i) allows infinitely many\nways to decompose the quantum state of the Universe into a\nsuperposition of orthogonal states.  The basis for the decomposition\ninto worlds follows from the common concept of a world that consists\nof objects in definite positions and states (“definite” on\nthe scale of our ability to distinguish them).  In the alternative\napproach, the basis of a centered world is defined directly by an\nobserver.  Therefore, given the nature of the observer and her\nconcepts for describing the world, the particular choice of the\ndecomposition (2) follows (up to a precision which is good FAPP, as\nrequired). If we do not ask why we are what we are, and why the world\nwe perceive is what it is, but only how we can explain relations\nbetween the events we observe in our world, then the problem of the\npreferred basis does not arise: we and the concepts of our world\ndefine the preferred basis.\n \n But if we do ask why we are what we are, we can explain more. Looking at\nthe details of the physical world, the structure of the Hamiltonian,\nthe value of the Planck constant, etc., one can understand  why the\nsentient beings we know are of a particular type and why they have\ntheir particular concepts for describing their worlds. The main\nargument is that the locality of interactions yields\nstability of worlds in which objects are well localized. The\nsmall value of the Planck constant allows macroscopic objects to be\nwell localized for a long  period of time.   Worlds corresponding \nto localized quantum states\n |ΨWORLD i›\ndo not split for a long enough time such that sentient beings can\nperceive the locations of macroscopic objects.  By contrast, a “world”\nobtained in another decomposition, e.g., the “world +” which is\ncharacterized by the relative phase of a superposition of states of\nmacroscopic objects being in macroscopically distinguishable states A\nand B,\n 1/√2(|ΨA›+|ΨB›)\n |Φ› ,\nsplits immediately, during a period of time which is much smaller than the\nperception time of any feasible sentient being, into two worlds: \nthe new “world +” and  the “world −”:\n  1/√2(|ΨA›−|ΨB›)\n |Φ′›.\n This is the phenomenon of decoherence\n which has attracted enormous attention in recent years, e.g.,\n  Joos et al. 2003,\n Zurek 2003,\n Schlosshauer 2007,\n also in the  “decoherent histories” framework of\n Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990,\n see Saunders 1995.\n   \nThere are many worlds existing in parallel in the Universe. Although\nall worlds are of the same physical size (this might not be true if we\ntake into account the quantum aspects of early cosmology), and in\nevery world sentient beings feel as “real” as in any other\nworld, there is a sense in which some worlds are larger than others. I describe\nthis property as the measure of existence of a world. \n The measure of existence of a world quantifies its ability to\ninterfere with other worlds in a gedanken experiment, see\n Vaidman 1998\n (p. 256), and is the basis for introducing (an illusion of ) \nprobability in\nthe MWI. The measure of existence is the parallel of the\nprobability measure discussed in\n Everett 1957\n and pictorially described in\n Lockwood 1989\n (p. 230).  \n\nGiven the decomposition (2), the measure of existence of the world\ni is\n µi\n =\n|αi|2.\n It can also be expressed as the expectation value of\nPi, the projection operator on\nthe space of quantum states corresponding to the actual values of all\nphysical variables describing the world i:  “I” also have a measure of existence. It is the sum of\nthe measures of existence of all different worlds in which I exist; it\ncan also be defined as the measure of existence of my perception\nworld. Note that I do not directly experience the measure of my\nexistence. I feel the same weight, see the same brightness,\netc. irrespectively of how tiny my measure of existence might be.  \nThe probability in the MWI cannot be introduced in a simple way as in\nquantum theory with collapse. However, even if there is no probability\nin the MWI, it is possible to explain our illusion of apparent\nprobabilistic events. Due to the identity of the mathematical\ncounterparts of worlds, we should not expect any difference between\nour experience in a particular world of the MWI and the experience in\na single-world universe with collapse at every quantum measurement.\n \n\nThe difficulty with the concept of probability in a deterministic\ntheory, such as the MWI, is that the only possible meaning for\nprobability is an ignorance probability, but there is no\nrelevant information that an observer who is going to perform a\nquantum experiment is ignorant about. The quantum state of the\nUniverse at one time specifies the quantum state at all times. If I am\ngoing to perform a quantum experiment with two possible outcomes such\nthat standard quantum mechanics predicts probability 1/3 for outcome A\nand 2/3 for outcome B, then, according to the MWI, both the world with\noutcome A and the world with outcome B will exist. It is senseless to\nask: “What is the probability that I will get A instead of\nB?” because I will correspond to both “Lev”s: the\none who observes A and the other one who observes B. \n\nTo solve this difficulty, Albert and Loewer 1988\nproposed the Many Minds interpretation (in which the different worlds\nare only in the minds of sentient beings). In addition to the quantum\nwave of the Universe, Albert and Loewer postulate that every sentient\nbeing has a continuum of minds. Whenever the quantum wave of the\nUniverse develops into a superposition containing states of a sentient\nbeing corresponding to different perceptions, the minds of this\nsentient being evolve randomly and independently to mental states\ncorresponding to these different states of perception (with\nprobabilities equal to the quantum probabilities for these states). In\nparticular, whenever a measurement is performed by an observer, the\nobserver's minds develop mental states that correspond to perceptions\nof the different outcomes, i.e. corresponding to the worlds A or B in\nour example. Since there is a continuum of minds, there will always be\nan infinity of minds in any sentient being and the procedure can\ncontinue indefinitely. This resolves the difficulty: each\n“I” corresponds to one mind and it ends up in a state\ncorresponding to a world with a particular outcome. However, this\nsolution comes at the price of introducing additional structure into\nthe theory, including a genuinely random process.   \nSaunders 2010 claims to solve the problem without\nintroducing additional structure into the theory. Working in the\nHeisenberg picture, he uses appropriate semantics and\n mereology according to which distinct worlds\nhave no parts in common, not even at early times when the worlds are\nqualitatively identical.  In the terminology of\n Lewis 1986 (p. 206) we have the divergence of\n worlds rather than overlap.\n Wilson 2013\ndevelops this idea by introducing a\nframework called “indexicalism,” which involves a set of\ndistinct\ndiverging “parallel” worlds in which each observer is\nlocated in only one world and all propositions are construed as\nself-locating (indexical). In\nWilson's words, “indexicalism allows us to vindicate treating the\nweights as a candidate objective probability measure”. However,\nit is\nnot clear how this program can succeed since it is hard to identify\ndiverging worlds in our experience and there is nothing in the\nmathematical formalism of standard quantum mechanics which can be a\ncounterpart of diverging worlds, see also Kent\n2010 (p. 345).  In the next section, the weights associated with\nworlds are related to subjective ignorance probability.\n   \nTappenden 2011 supports the proposal for explaining how \nthe illusion of probability arises,\n Vaidman1998, 2012, in which I\nidentify the ignorance probability with the post-measurement\nuncertainty.  It seems senseless to ask: “What is the\nprobability that Lev in the world A will observe\nA?” This probability is trivially equal to 1. The task is\nto define the probability in such a way that we could reconstruct the\nprediction of the standard approach where the probability for A\nis 1/3. It is indeed senseless to ask you what is the\nprobability that Lev in the world A will observe A, but\nthis might be a meaningful question when addressed to Lev in the world of\nthe outcome A. Under normal circumstances, the world A\nis created (i.e. measuring devices and objects which interact with\nmeasuring devices become localized according to the outcome A)\nbefore Lev is aware of the result A. Then, it is sensible to\nask this Lev about his probability of being in world A. There is a\ndefinite outcome which this Lev will see, but he is ignorant of this\noutcome at the time of the question. In order to make this point\nvivid, I proposed an experiment in which the experimenter is given a\nsleeping pill before the experiment. Then, while asleep, he is moved\nto room A or to room B depending on the results of the\nexperiment. When the experimenter has woken up (in one of the rooms),\nbut before he has opened his eyes, he is asked “In which room\nare you?” Certainly, there is a matter of fact about which room\nhe is in (he can learn about it by opening his eyes), but he is\nignorant about this fact at the time of the question.  \nThis construction provides the ignorance interpretation\nof probability, but the value of the probability has to be postulated: \nThis postulate (named the\n Born-Vaidman rule by  Tappenden 2011) is a\ncounterpart of the collapse postulate of the standard quantum mechanics\naccording to which, after a measurement, the quantum state collapses to a\nparticular branch with probability proportional to its squared\namplitude. (See the section on the measurement problem in\nthe entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.)\n However, it differs in two aspects. First, it  parallels\nonly the second part of the collapse postulate, the Born Rule, and\nsecond, it is related only to part (ii) of the MWI, the connection to\nour experience, and not to the mathematical part of the theory\n(i). \nThe question of the probability of obtaining A also makes sense for\nthe Lev in world B before he becomes aware of the outcome.  Both\n“Lev”s have the same information on the basis of which they should\ngive their answer. According to the probability postulate they will\ngive the same answer: 1/3 (the relative measure of existence\nof the world A). Since Lev before the measurement is associated with\ntwo “Lev”s after the measurement who have identical ignorance\nprobability concepts for the outcome of the experiment, I can\ndefine the probability of the outcome of the experiment to be\nperformed as the ignorance probability of the successors of Lev for being\nin a world with a particular outcome. \nThe “sleeping pill” argument does not reduce the probability of an\noutcome of a quantum experiment to a familiar concept of probability\nin the classical context. The quantum situation is genuinely\ndifferent.  Since all outcomes of a quantum experiment are\nrealized, there is no probability in the usual sense. Nevertheless, my construction\n  leads all believers in the MWI to behave according to the following\nprinciple: \nWith this principle our behavior should be similar to the behavior of a\nbeliever in the collapse theory who cares about possible future\nworlds in proportion to the probability of their occurrence.    \n There are other arguments supporting the Probability Postulate. In\n an earlier approach, Tappenden 2000 (p. 111)\n adopts a different semantics according to which “I” live in all\nbranches and have “distinct experiences” in different\n“superslices”. He uses “weight of a\nsuperslice” instead of measure of existence and argues that it\nis intelligible to associate probabilities according to the Probability Postulate.  \nExploiting a variety of ideas in decoherence\ntheory such as the relational theory of tense and theories of identity over\ntime,\n  Saunders 1998 also argues for the\n“identification of probability with the Hilbert Space norm” (which\nequals the measure of existence).\n Page 2003\n promotes an approach  named Mindless\nSensationalism. The basic concept in this approach is a\nconscious experience. He assigns weights to different\nexperiences depending on the quantum state of the universe, as the\nexpectation values of presently-unknown positive operators\ncorresponding to the experiences (similar to the measures of\nexistence of the corresponding worlds\n (3)).\n Page writes “… experiences with greater weights exist in some\nsense more …” In all of these approaches, the postulate is\nintroduced through an analogy with treatments of time, e.g., the\nmeasure of the existence of a world is analogous to the duration of a\ntime interval. Note also Greaves 2004 who\n advocates  the “Behavior Principle” on the basis of the\n decision-theoretic reflection principle related to the next section.\n \n\nIn an ambitious work Deutsch 1999 claimed to\nderive the Probability Postulate from quantum\nformalism and classical decision theory. In Deutsch's argument the\nnotion of probability is operationalised by being reduced to an\nagent's betting preferences. So an agent who is indifferent between\nreceiving $20 on those branches where spin “up” is observed and\nreceiving $10 on all branches by definition is deemed to give\nprobability 1/2 to the spin-up branches. Deutsch then attempts to\nprove that the only rationally coherent strategy for an agent is to\nassign these operationalised “probabilities” to equal the\nquantum-mechanical branch weights.  Wallace 2003,\n2007, 2010b,\n 2012 developed this approach by making explicit the\ntacit assumptions in Deutsch's argument.  In the most recent version\nof these proofs, the central assumptions are (i) the symmetry\nstructure of unitary quantum mechanics; (ii) that an agent's\npreferences are consistent across time; (iii) that an agent is\nindifferent to the fine-grained branching structure of the world per\nse.  Early criticisms of the Deutsch-Wallace approach focussed on\ncircularity concerns (Barnum et al.2000,\n Baker 2007,\n Hemmo and Pitowsky 2007). As the program led to \nmore explicit proofs, criticism turned to the decision-theoretic\n assumptions being made (Lewis 2010,\n Albert 2010,\n Kent 2010,\n Price 2010).\n Vaidman 2012 believes that to derive\n the Probability Postulate, at least some\n connection between the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics\n and probability has to be postulated and points out that\n  it is enough to assume that the probability of an outcome of\n a quantum measurement depends only on the measure of existence \nof the corresponding world.\nThus, if all the worlds in which a particular experiment took place\nhave equal measures of existence, then the probability of a particular\noutcome is simply proportional to the number of worlds with this\noutcome.  The measures of existence of worlds are, in general, not\nequal, but the experimenters in all the worlds can perform additional\nspecially tailored auxiliary measurements of some variables such that\nall the new worlds will have equal measures of existence. The\nexperimenters should be completely indifferent to the results of these\nauxiliary measurements: their only purpose is to split the worlds into\n“equal-weight” worlds.  This procedure reconstructs the standard\nquantum probability rule from the counting worlds approach;\nsee  Deutsch 1999 and Zurek 2005 \nfor details. Another derivation is based on\n Gleason's 1957\n theorem about the uniqueness of the probability measure. Similar conclusions\n can be reached from  the analysis of the frequency operator\noriginated by  Hartle 1968.\nNote that many of these arguments can be applied in the frameworks of\n various interpretations of quantum  mechanics, not just the MWI.\n \nThere are also more speculative proposals to deal with the issue of\nprobability in the MWI. Weissman 1999 has\nproposed a modification of quantum theory with additional non-linear\ndecoherence (and hence with even more worlds than in the standard MWI)\nwhich can lead asymptotically to worlds of equal mean measure for\ndifferent outcomes.  Hanson 2003, 2006\n proposed decoherence dynamics in which\nobservers of different worlds “mangle” each other such that\napproximate Born rule is obtained. Van Wesep 2006\nused some algebraic method for deriving the probability rule.\n  Buniy et al. 2006 used the ideas of\ndecoherent histories approach of\n Gell-Mann and Hartle 1990.\n  \nIt has frequently been claimed, e.g. by\n De Witt 1970,\n that the MWI is in principle indistinguishable from the ideal\ncollapse theory. This is not so.\nThe collapse leads to effects that do not exist if the MWI is the\ncorrect theory. To observe the collapse we would need a super\ntechnology which allows for the “undoing” of a quantum experiment,\nincluding a reversal of the detection process by macroscopic\ndevices. See\n Lockwood 1989 (p. 223),\n Vaidman 1998 (p. 257),\n and other proposals in Deutsch 1986.\n These proposals are all for gedanken experiments that\ncannot be performed with current or any foreseeable future technology.\nIndeed, in these experiments an interference of different worlds has to\nbe observed. Worlds are different when at least one macroscopic object\nis in macroscopically distinguishable states. Thus, what is needed is\nan interference experiment with a macroscopic body. Today there are\ninterference experiments with larger and larger objects (e.g.,\n fullerene molecules C70, see\n Brezger et al. 2002 ),\nbut these objects are still not large enough to be considered\n“macroscopic”. Such experiments can only refine the\nconstraints on the boundary where the collapse might take place. A\ndecisive experiment should involve the interference of states which\ndiffer in a macroscopic number of degrees of freedom: an impossible\ntask for today's technology.  It can be argued, however, that the\nburden of an experimental proof lies with the opponents of the MWI,\nbecause it is they who claim that there is a new physics beyond the\nwell tested Schrödinger equation. As the analysis of\n Schlosshauerl 2006 shows, we have no such\nevidence. \nThe MWI is wrong if there is a physical process of collapse of the wave\n function of the Universe to a single-world quantum state. Some ingenious\n proposals for such a process have been made (see\n Pearle 1986\n and the entry on\n collapse theories).\n These proposals (and\n  Weissman's 1999\n non-linear decoherence idea) have additional observable effects, such as a\ntiny energy non-conservation, that were tested in several\nexperiments, e.g. Collett et al. 1995. \nThe effects were not found and some (but not all!)  of\nthese models have been ruled out, see\n Adler and Bassi 2009.   \nMuch of the experimental evidence for quantum mechanics is statistical\nin nature.  Greaves and Myrvold 2010 made a\ncareful study showing that our experimental data from quantum\nexperiments supports the Probability Postulate of the MWI no less\nthan it supports the Born rule in other approaches to quantum\nmechanics. Thus, statistical analysis of quantum experiments should\nnot help us testing the MWI, but I might mention speculative\ncosmological arguments in support of the MWI by\n Page 1999, Kragh 2009,\n Aguirre and Tegmark 2011, and\n Tipler 2012.\n \nSome of the objections to the MWI follow from misinterpretations due to\nthe multitude of various MWIs. The terminology of the MWI can be confusing:\n“world” is “universe” in\n Deutsch 1996,\n while “universe” is “multiverse”. There are \ntwo very different\napproaches with the same name “The Many-Minds Interpretation (MMI)”.\nThe  MMI of\n Albert and Loewer 1988\n mentioned above should not\nbe confused with the MMI of\n Lockwood et al. 1996\n (which  resembles the approach of  Zeh 1981).\n Further, the MWI in the Heisenberg representation,\n Deutsch 2002,\n differs significantly from the MWI presented in the Schrödinger\nrepresentation (used here). The MWI presented here is very close to\nEverett's original proposal, but in the entry on\n Everett's relative state formulation of quantum mechanics,\n as well as in his book,\n Barrett 1999,\n uses the name “MWI” for the splitting worlds\nview publicized by\n De Witt 1970.\n This approach has been justly criticized: it has both some kind of\ncollapse (an irreversible splitting of worlds in a preferred basis)\nand the multitude of worlds. Now I will consider some  objections in\ndetail. \n\nIt seems that the majority of the opponents of the MWI reject it\nbecause, for them, introducing a very large number of worlds that we\ndo not see is an extreme violation of Ockham's principle:\n“Entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity”. However, in\njudging physical theories one could reasonably argue that one should\nnot multiply physical laws beyond necessity either (such a version of\nOckham's Razor has been applied in the past), and in this\nrespect the MWI is the most economical theory. Indeed, it has all the\nlaws of the standard quantum theory, but without the collapse\npostulate, which is the most problematic of the physical laws.  The MWI is also\nmore economic than Bohmian mechanics ,which has in addition the\nontology of the particle trajectories and the laws which give their\nevolution.\n Tipler 1986 (p. 208)\nhas presented an effective analogy with the criticism of Copernican\ntheory on the grounds of Ockham's razor. \n\nOne might also consider a possible philosophical advantage of the plurality of worlds\nin the MWI, similar to that claimed by realists about possible worlds, such as\n Lewis 1986\n (see the discussion of the analogy between the MWI and Lewis's\ntheory by\n Skyrms 1976).\n However, the analogy is not complete: Lewis' theory considers\nall logically possible worlds, far more than all the worlds that are incorporated\nin the quantum state of the Universe. \nA common criticism of the MWI stems from the fact that the formalism\nof quantum theory allows infinitely many ways to decompose the\nquantum state of the Universe into a superposition of orthogonal\nstates. The question arises: “Why choose the particular decomposition\n(2) and not any other?” Since other decompositions might lead to a\nvery different picture, the whole construction seems to lack\npredictive power.   The locality of physical interactions defines the preferred basis.\nAs described in Section 3.5, only localized states of macroscopic\nobjects are stable. And indeed, due to the extensive research on\ndecoherence, the problem of preferred basis is not considered as a\nserious objection anymore, see Wallace 2010a.\n Singling out position as a preferred variable for solving\nthe preferred basis problem might be considered as a weakness, but on\nthe other hand, it is implausible that out of a mathematical theory of\nvectors in Hilbert space one can derive what our world should be. (So\nit is not surprising that\n Schwindt 2012 could not do it.)  We have to add some\ningredients to our theory and adding locality, the property of all\nknown physical interactions, seems to be very natural. Position as a\npreferred variable is not an ontological claim (as options discussed\nin the next section), but it helps to build a bridge between the\nontology of quantum mechanics and our experience.\n   As mentioned above, the gap between the mathematical formalism of\nthe MWI, namely the wave function of the Universe, and our experience\nis larger than in other interpretations. This is the reason why many\nthought that the ontology of the wave function is not enough. \n Bell 1987 (p.201) felt that either the wave function\nis not everything, or it is not right. He was looking for a theory\nwith local “beables”. Many followed Bell in search of a \n“primitive ontology” in 3+1 space-time, see\n Allorri et al. 2014.  \nA particular reason why the wave function of the Universe cannot be\nthe whole ontology lies in the argument, led by\n Maudlin 2010, that this is a wrong type of object. \nThe wave function of\nthe Universe is defined in 3N dimensional configuration space, while\nwe need an entity in 3+1 space-time (like the primitive ontology), see\ndiscussion by Albert 1996,\n Lewis 2004,\n Monton 2006,\n Ney 2012.  Addition of “primitive \nontology” to the wave function of\nthe Universe helps us understand our experience, but complicates the\nmathematical part of the theory. It is not necessary. The expectation\nvalues of the density of each particle in space-time, which is the concept\nderived from the wave functions corresponding to different worlds, can\nplay the role of “primitive ontology”. Since interactions between\nparticles are local in space, this is what is needed for finding\ncausal connections ending at our experience.  The density of particles\nis gauge independent and also properly transforms between different\nLorentz observers. Thus, explanation of our experience is unaffected\nby the “narratability failure” problem of\n Albert 2013: the wave function description might be different for\ndifferent Lorentz observers, but the description in terms of densities\nof particles is the same.  Note also an alternative approach based on\n3+1 space-time by Wallace and Timpson 2010 who,\nbeing dissatisfied with the wave function ontology, introduced the\n Spacetime State Realism.\n  \nA popular criticism of the MWI in the past, see\n Belinfante 1975, which was recently repeated by\n Putnam 2005, is based on the naive derivation of the\nprobability of an outcome of a quantum experiment as being\nproportional to the number of worlds with this outcome. Such\na derivation leads to the wrong predictions, but accepting the idea of\nprobability being proportional to the measure of existence of a world\nresolves this problem. Although this involves adding a postulate, we\ndo not complicate the mathematical part (i) of the theory since we do\nnot change the ontology, namely, the wave function.  It is a postulate\nbelonging to part (ii), the connection to our experience, and it is a\nvery natural postulate: differences in the mathematical descriptions\nof worlds are manifest in our experience, see\n Saunders 1998.\n   Another criticism related to probability follows from the claim,\napparently made by Everett himself and later by many other proponents\nof the MWI, see De Witt 1970, that the\nProbability Postulate can be  derived  just from the\nformalism of the MWI. Unfortunately, the criticism of this derivation\n(which might well be correct) is considered to be a criticism of the\nMWI, see Kent 1990. The recent revival of this\nclaim involving decision theory, Deutsch 1999,\nwhich also encountered strong criticism (see Section 4.4), drew\nnegative publicity to the MWI. It might be that the MWI has no\nadvantage over other interpretations insofar as the derivation of the\nBorn rule is concerned, but it also has no disadvantage, so criticism on \nthese grounds is not founded, see\n Papineau 2010. \nThe issue, named by Wallace 2003 as the\n“incoherence” probability problem, is arguably the most serious\ndifficulty. How to talk about probability when all possible outcomes\nhappen? This led Saunders and Wallace 2008a\nto introduce uncertainty to the MWI.  However, Section 4.2 shows how\none can explain the illusion of probability of an observer in a world,\nwhile the Universe incorporating all the worlds remains\ndeterministic. Albert 2010 argues that the\nprobability I introduce appears too late.\n Vaidman 2012 answers Albert by viewing the\n probability as the value of a\nrational bet on a particular result.  The results of the betting of\nthe experimenter are relevant for his successors emerging after\nperforming the experiment in different worlds. Since the experimenter\nis related to all of his successors and they all have identical\nrational strategies for betting, then this should also be the strategy\nof the experimenter before the experiment. \n\nThere are claims that a believer in the MWI will behave in an\nirrational way. One claim is based on the naive argument described in\nthe previous section: a believer who assigns equal probabilities to\nall different worlds will make equal bets for the outcomes of quantum\nexperiments that have unequal probabilities. \n\nAnother claim,\n Lewis 2000,\n is related to the strategy of a believer in the MWI who is offered\nto play a quantum Russian roulette game. The argument is\nthat I, who would not accept an offer to play a classical Russian\nroulette game, should agree to play the roulette any number of times if\nthe triggering occurs according to the outcome of a quantum\nexperiment.  Indeed, at the end, there will be one world in which Lev\nis a multi-millionaire and in all other worlds there will be no\nLev Vaidman alive. Thus, in the future, Lev will be a rich and\npresumably  happy man. \n However, adopting the\n Probability Postulate\nleads all believers in the MWI to behave according to the\n Behavior Principle and with this principle our\nbehavior is similar to the behavior of a believer in the collapse\ntheory who cares about possible future worlds according to the\nprobability of their occurrence. I should not agree to play quantum\nRussian roulette because the measure of existence of worlds with Lev\ndead will be much larger than the measure of existence of the worlds\nwith a rich and alive Lev. \nAlthough in most situations the Behavior Principle makes the MWI\nbeliever act in the usual way, there are some situations in which a belief in the\nMWI might cause a change in a social behaviour,\n Vaidman 1990 (Section 16). If I decided to fill a\nlottery ticket, I can toss a coin several times to get a random number\nand hope to win the prize, or I can split the world several times\nusing the \n Quantum World Splitter\n such that every number will be filled by\nLev Vaidman at least in one world in our Universe, so I can be sure\nthat there will be a Lev Vaidman with the big prize. The choice,\nhowever, is not obvious, since in choosing the quantum coin I also\nmake sure that there will be many worlds in which I lost.\n (Albrecht and Phillips 2012 claim that even a toss of\na regular coin splits the world, so there is no need for a quantum\nsplitter.)\n\n \n\nThe reason for adopting the MWI is that it avoids the collapse of the\nquantum wave. (Other no-collapse theories are not better than MWI for\nvarious reasons, e.g., nonlocality of Bohmian mechanics; and the\ndisadvantage of all of them is that they have some additional\nstructure.)  The collapse postulate is a physical law that differs\nfrom all known physics in two aspects: it is genuinely random and it\ninvolves some kind of action at a distance.  According to the collapse\npostulate the outcome of a quantum experiment is not determined by the\ninitial conditions of the Universe prior to the experiment: only the\nprobabilities are governed by the initial state.  There is no\nexperimental evidence in favor of collapse and against the MWI.  We\nneed not assume that Nature plays dice: science has stronger\nexplanatory power. The MWI is a deterministic theory for a physical\nUniverse and it explains why a world appears to be indeterministic for\nhuman observers. \n The MWI allows for a local explanation of our Universe.\n The most celebrated example of nonlocality  given by\n Bell 1964\nin the context of the\n Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument\n cannot get off the ground  in the framework of the MWI\n because it requires a predetermined single outcome\nof a quantum experiment, see discussion in\n Bacciagaluppi 2002 .\n There is no action at a distance in our Universe, \nbut there is an entanglement. And a  “world” is a \nnonlocal concept. This explains why we observe\n non-local correlations in a particular world.\n   \nDeutsch 2012 claims to provide an alternative\nvindication of quantum locality using a quantum information\nframework. This approach started with\n Deutsch and Hayden 2000 analyzing the flow of \nquantum information using\nthe Heisenberg picture. After discussions by\n Rubin 2001 and Deutsch 2002,\n Hewitt-Horsman and Vedral 2007 analyzed the\n uniqueness of the\nphysical picture of the information flow. \n Timpson 2005 and\n Wallace and Timpson 2007 questioned\nthe locality demonstration in this approach and the meaning of the\nlocality claim was clarified in Deutsch 2012.\n Rubin 2011 suggested that this approach might\nprovide a simpler route toward generalization of the MWI of quantum\nmechanics to the MWI of field theory.\n \nThe MWI resolves most, if not all, paradoxes of quantum mechanics\n(e.g., Schrödinger cat), see Vaidman 1994.\nA physical paradox is a phenomenon contradicting our intuition. The\nlaws of physics govern the Universe incorporating all the worlds and\nthis is why, when we limit ourselves to a single world, we may run\ninto a paradox.  An example is getting information about a region from\nwhere no particle ever came using the interaction-free\nmeasurement of Elitzur and Vaidman 1993.\n Indeed, on the scale of the Universe there is no paradox: in\nother worlds particles were in that region.   \nVaidman 2001 finds it advantageous to think about\nall worlds together even in analysing a controversial issue of\nclassical probability theory,\n Sleeping Beauty Problem.\n Accepting the Probability Postulate reduces the\nanalysis of probability to a calculation of the measures of existence\nof various worlds. Note, however, that the Quantum Sleeping Beauty\nalso became a topic of a hot controversy:\n Lewis 2007, Papineau and Durà-Vilà 2009,\n Bradley 2011, Wilson 2014,\nSchwarz 2012,\n Groisman et al. 2013.\n  \nThe strongest proponents of the MWI can be found among cosmologists,\ne.g., Aguirre and Tegmark 2011. In quantum\ncosmology the MWI allows for discussion of the whole Universe, thereby\navoiding the difficulty of the standard interpretation which requires\nan external observer. Recently, Bousso and Susskind 2012\n argued that even considerations in the framework of string\ntheory lead to the MWI.\n  \nAnother community where many favor the MWI is that of the\nresearchers in quantum information.  In quantum computing, the key\nissue is the parallel processing performed on the same computer; this\nis very similar to the basic picture of the MWI. Recently the\nusefulness of the MWI for explaining the speedup of quantum\ncomputation has been questioned:\n Steane 2003, \n Duwell 2007, and\n Cuffaro 2012.\nIt is not that the quantum computation cannot be understood without\nthe framework of the MWI; rather, it is just easier to think about quantum\nalgorithms as parallel computations performed in parallel worlds,\n Deutsch and Jozsa 1992. There is no way to use all\nthe information obtained in all parallel computations — the quantum\ncomputer algorithm is a method in which the outcomes of all\ncalculations interfere, yielding the desired result. The cluster-state\nquantum computer also performs parallel computations, although it is\nharder to see how we get the final result. The criticism follows from\nidentifying the computational worlds with decoherent worlds. Quantum\ncomputer process has no decoherence and the preferred basis is chosen\nto be the computational basis.\n  \nRecent studies suggest that some of the fathers of quantum mechanics\nheld views close to the MWI: Allori et al. 2011 \nsay this about Schrödinger, and\n Becker 2004 about von Neumann. At the birth of the MWI\n Wheeler 1957 wrote: “No escape seems possible from\nthis relative state formulation if one wants to have a complete\nmathematical model for the quantum mechanics ...”  Since then, the MWI\nstruggles against the\n Copenhagen interpretation, see\n Byrne 2010, gaining some\nlegitimacy only in recent years Deutsch 1996,\n Bevers 2011, and Barrett 2011.\nThe current controversial status of the MWI can be learned from the\nvery diverse opinions in the talks of its 50th anniversary\ncelebrations:\n Oxford 2007,\n Perimeter 2007 .\n","contact.mail":"vaidman@post.tau.ac.il","contact.domain":"post.tau.ac.il"}]
