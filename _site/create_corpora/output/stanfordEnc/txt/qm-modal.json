The phrase now encompasses\na class of interpretations, and is better taken to refer to a\ngeneral approach to the interpretation of quantum theory. We shall\ndescribe the history of modal interpretations, how the phrase has come\nto be used in this way, and the general program of (at least some of)\nthose who advocate this approach.\n\nIn traditional approaches to quantum measurement theory a central role\nis played by the projection postulate, which asserts that upon\nmeasurement of a physical system its state will be projected\n(“collapses”) onto a state corresponding to the value\nfound in the measurement. However, this postulate leads to many\ndifficulties: What causes this discontinuous change in the physical\nstate of a system? What exactly is a “measurement” as\nopposed to an ordinary physical interaction? The postulate is\nespecially worrying when applied to entangled compound systems whose\ncomponents are well-separated in space. For example, in the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment there are strict correlations\nbetween two systems that have interacted in the past, in spite of the\nfact that the correlated quantities are not sharply defined in the\nindividual systems. The projection postulate in this case implies that\nthe collapse resulting from a measurement on one of the systems\ninstantaneously defines a sharp property in the distant other system.\n(See the discussion of the collapse or projection postulate in the\nentry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.) \nA possible way clear of these problems was noticed by van Fraassen\n(1972, 1974, 1991), who proposed to eliminate the projection postulate\nfrom the theory. Others had made this proposal before, as Bohm (1952)\nin his theory (itself preceded by de Broglie’s proposals from\nthe 1920s), Everett (1957) in his relative-state interpretation and De\nWitt (1970) with the many-worlds interpretation. (See the entries on\n Bohmian mechanics,\n Everett’s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics, and the\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.)\n Van Fraassen’s proposal was, however, different from these\nother approaches. It relied, in particular, on a distinction between\nwhat he called the “dynamical state” and the “value\nstate” of a system at any instant: \nThe dynamical state is just the quantum state of the ordinary textbook\napproach (a vector or density matrix in Hilbert space). For an\nisolated system, it always evolves according to the\nSchrödinger equation (in non-relativistic quantum mechanics): so\nthe dynamical state never collapses during its evolution. \nThe value state is (typically) different from the dynamical state. The\ngeneral idea of this original proposal, and of modal interpretations\nin general, is that physical systems at all times possess a number of\nwell-defined physical properties, i.e., definite values of physical\nquantities; these properties can be represented by the system’s\nvalue state. Which physical quantities are sharply defined, and which\nvalues they take, may change in time. Empirical adequacy of course\nrequires that the dynamical state generate the correct Born\nfrequencies of observable quantities. \nAn essential feature of this approach is that a system may have a\nsharp value of an observable even if the dynamical state is not an\neigenstate of that same observable. The proposal thus violates the\nso-called “eigenstate-eigenvalue link”, which says that a\nsystem can only have a sharp value of an observable (namely, one of\nits eigenvalues) if its quantum state is the corresponding eigenstate.\nIn the value state terminology, the eigenstate-eigenvalue link would\nsay that a system has the value state corresponding to a given\neigenvalue of a given observable if and only if its dynamical state is\nan eigenstate of the observable corresponding to that eigenvalue. This\noriginal modal approach accepts the “if” part, but denies\nthe “only if” part. \nWhat are the possible “value states” for a given system at\na given time? Van Fraassen stipulates the following restriction:\npropositions about a physical system cannot be jointly true, unless\nthey are represented by commuting observables. In other words, the\nnon-commutativity of observables imposes limits not on our\nknowledge about the properties of a system, but rather on the\npossibility of joint existence of properties, independently\nof our knowledge. Non-commuting quantities, like position and\nmomentum, cannot jointly be well-defined quantities of a physical\nsystem. \nEmpirical adequacy requires that, in cases of measurement, the\nafter-measurement value state of the apparatus corresponds to the\n(definite) measurement result. Therefore, in these cases one would\nexpect the dynamical state to generate a probability measure over\nexactly the set of possible measurement results. However, van\nFraassen’s original modal approach is more liberal in its\nassignment of possible value states, and according to many this does\nnot yield a satisfactory account of measurements (see Ruetsche\n1996). \nVan Fraassen’s proposal is “modal” because it\nnaturally connects to a modal logic of quantum propositions. Indeed,\nthe dynamical state in general only tells us what is\npossible. According to van Fraassen, one does not need to\nview this as arising from an incompleteness of the description, which\nit is the aim of science to remove—quantum mechanics may be\ninherently probabilistic and modal (see Bueno 2014 for the relation\nbetween this and van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism, which is\nhostile to modal realism). \nIt is easy to see how, along the lines of van Fraassen’s ideas,\na program could come into being for providing a more elaborate\n“realist” interpretation of quantum theory, a program to\nwhich we now turn. \nIn the 1980s several authors presented realist interpretations which,\nin retrospect, can be regarded as elaborations or variations on the\njust-mentioned modal themes (for an overview and references, see Dieks\nand Vermaas 1998). In spite of the differences among them, all the\nmodal interpretations agree on the following points: \nThe Kochen-Specker theorem (1967) is a barrier to any realist\nclassical-like interpretation of quantum mechanics, since it proves\nthe impossibility of ascribing precise values to all physical\nquantities (observables) of a quantum system simultaneously, while\npreserving the functional relations between commuting observables.\n(See the entry on the\n the Kochen-Specker theorem.)\n Therefore, realist non-collapse interpretations are committed to\nselecting a privileged set of definite-valued observables out of all\nobservables. Each modal interpretation thus supplies a “rule of\ndefinite-value ascription” or “actualization rule”,\nwhich picks out, from the set of all observables of a quantum system,\nthe subset of definite-valued properties. \nThe question is: what should this actualization rule look like? Since\nthe mid-1990s a series of approaches faced this question (Clifton\n1995a,b; Dickson 1995a,b; Dieks 1995). Each one of them proposed a\ngroup of conditions that the set of definite-valued properties should\nobey, and characterized this set in terms of the dynamical state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) of the system. The common result was that the possible\nvalue states of the components of a two-part composite system are\ngiven by the states occurring in the Schmidt (bi-orthogonal)\ndecomposition of the dynamical state, or, equivalently, by the\nprojectors occurring in the spectral decomposition of the density\nmatrices representing partial systems (obtained by partial\ntracing)—see Section 4 for more details. \nThe definite-valued properties have also been characterized somewhat\ndifferently (Bub and Clifton 1996; for an improved version, see Bub,\nClifton and Goldstein 2000), that is, in terms of the quantum state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) plus a “privileged observable”\n\\(\\boldsymbol{R}\\), which is privileged in the sense that it\nrepresents a property that is always definite-valued (see also Dieks\n2005, 2007). On this basis, Bub (1992, 1994, 1997) suggests that with\nhindsight a number of traditional interpretations of quantum theory\ncan be characterized as modal interpretations. Notable among them are\nthe Dirac-von Neumann interpretation, (what Bub takes to be)\nBohr’s interpretation, and Bohm’s theory. Bohm’s\ntheory is a modal interpretation in which the privileged observable\n\\(\\boldsymbol{R}\\) is the position observable. \nThe Hilbert space of the universe \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\univ}\\),\nlike any Hilbert space, can be factorized in countless ways. If one\nsupposes that each factorization defines a legitimate set of\nsubsystems of the universe, the multiple factorizability implies that\nthere exists a multiplicity of ways of defining the building blocks of\nnature. If the properties (value states) of all these quantum systems\nare defined by means of the partial trace with respect to the rest of\nthe universe (see later for more details), it turns out that a\ncontradiction of the Kochen-Specker type arises (Bacciagaluppi\n1995). \nThe Atomic Modal Interpretation (AMI, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson 1999)\ntries to overcome this obstacle by assuming that there is in nature a\nfixed set of mutually disjoint atomic quantum systems\n\\(S^j\\) that constitute the building blocks of\nall the other quantum systems. From the mathematical point of view,\nthis means that the Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\univ}\\) of\nthe entire universe can only be meaningfully factorized in a single\nway, which defines a preferred factorization. If each atomic\nquantum system \\(S^j\\) is represented by its\ncorresponding Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^j\\), then the\nHilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\univ}\\) of the universe must be\nwritten as \nThe main appeal of this idea is that it is in consonance with the\nstandard model of particle physics, where the fundamental blocks of\nnature are the elemental particles, e.g., quarks, electrons, photons,\netc., and their interactions. The property ascription to the atomic\nquantum systems in the AMI further follows the general idea of modal\ninterpretations, that is, the ascription depends via a fixed rule on\nthe dynamical state of the system. \nThe main challenge for the AMI is to justify the assumption that there\nis a preferred partition of the universe and to provide some idea\nabout what this factorization should look like. AMI also faces a\nconceptual problem. In this interpretation, a non-atomic quantum\nsystem \\(S^{\\sigma}\\), defined as composite of atomic quantum systems,\ndoes not necessarily have properties that correspond to the outcomes\nof measurements. The reason is that the system \\(S^{\\sigma}\\) might be\nin the quantum state \\(\\varrho^{\\sigma}\\) with an eigenprojector\n\\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\) such that\n\\(\\mathrm{Tr}^{\\sigma}(\\varrho^{\\sigma}\\Pi^{\\sigma}) = 1\\). This implies that\nif one measured the property represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\), one\nwould obtain a positive outcome with probability 1. But it may be the\ncase that the projector \\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\) is not a composite of\natomic properties and, therefore, according to the AMI, it is not a\nproperty possessed by the composite quantum system\n\\(S^{\\sigma}\\).  \nTwo answers to this conceptual difficulty have been proposed. The\nfirst allows the existence of dispositional properties in addition to\nordinary properties (Clifton 1996). According to the second answer,\nthe projector \\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\) of the composite system\n\\(S^{\\sigma}\\) shows that \\(S^{\\sigma}\\) has a\ncollective dynamical effect onto the measurement device, that is, an\neffect that cannot be explained by the action of the atomic components\n(Dieks 1998). In other words, the composite quantum system, when\ninteracting with its environment, can behave as a collective entity,\nscreening off the contribution of the atomic quantum systems. This\nmeans that sometimes a non-atomic quantum system\n\\(S^{\\sigma}\\) may be taken as if it were an atomic\nquantum system within the framework of a coarse-grained\ndescription. \nIn the biorthogonal-decomposition interpretation (BDMI, sometimes\nknown as “Kochen-Dieks modal interpretation”, Kochen 1985;\nDieks 1988, 1989a,b, 1994a,b), the definite-valued observables are\npicked out by the biorthogonal (Schmidt) decomposition of the pure\nquantum state of the system: \n\nBiorthogonal Decomposition Theorem:\nGiven a vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) in a tensor-product Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^1\n\\otimes \\mathcal{H}^2\\), there exist bases \\(\\{\\ket{a_i}\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\ket{p_i}\\}\\)\nfor \\(\\mathcal{H}^1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{H}^2\\) respectively, such that \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) can be\nwritten as a linear combination of terms of the form \\(\\ket{a_i}\n\\otimes \\ket{p_i}\\). If the absolute values (modulus) of the\ncoefficients in this linear combination are all unequal, then the\nbases are unique (see, for example, Schrödinger 1935 for a\nproof).\n \nIn quantum mechanics the theorem means that, given a composite system\nconsisting of two subsystems, its state picks out (in many cases,\nuniquely) a basis for each of the subsystems. According to the BDMI,\nthose bases generate the definite-valued properties (the value states)\nof the corresponding subsystems. \nThe BDMI is particularly appropriate to account for quantum\nmeasurement. Let us consider an ideal measurement under the standard\nvon Neumann model, according to which a quantum measurement is an\ninteraction between a system \\(S\\) and a measuring apparatus\n\\(M\\). Before the interaction, \\(M\\) is prepared in a\nready-to-measure state \\(\\ket{p_0}\\), eigenvector of\nthe pointer observable \\(P\\) of \\(M\\), and the state of\n\\(S\\) is a superposition of the eigenstates\n\\(\\ket{a_i}\\) of an observable \\(A\\) of\n\\(S\\). The interaction introduces a correlation between the\neigenstates \\(\\ket{a_i}\\) of \\(A\\) and the\neigenstates \\(\\ket{p_i}\\) of \\(P\\):  \nIn this case, according to the BDMI prescription, the preferred\ncontext of the measured system \\(S\\) is defined by the set\n\\(\\{\\ket{a_i}\\}\\) and the preferred context of the measuring apparatus\n\\(M\\) is defined by the set \\(\\{\\ket{p_i}\\}\\). Therefore, the pointer\nposition is a definite-valued property of the apparatus: it acquires\none of its possible values (eigenvalues) \\(p_i\\). And analogously in\nthe measured system: the measured observable is a definite-valued\nproperty of the measured system, and it acquires one of its possible\nvalues (eigenvalues) \\(a_i\\).  \nIn spite of the fact that this modal interpretation is characterized\nby the central role played by biorthogonal decomposition, two\ndifferent versions can be distinguished. One of them adopts a\nmetaphysics in which all properties are relational and, as a\nconsequence, the fact that the application of the interpretation is\nrestricted to subsystems of a two-component compound system is not a\nproblem (Kochen 1985). This relation has been called\n“witnessing”: properties are not possessed by the system\nabsolutely, but only when it is “witnessed” by another\nsystem. Consider the measurement described above: the pointer\n“witnesses” the value acquired by the measured observable\nof the measured system. \nBy contrast, according to the other version (Dieks 1988, 1989a,b) the\nproperties ascribed to the system do not have a relational character.\nThis proposal therefore faces consistency questions about the\nassignments of definite values to observables according to different\nways of splitting up the total system into components. Consider, for\nexample, the three-component composite system \\(\\alpha \\beta \\chi\\). We\ncould apply the biorthogonal decomposition theorem to the\ntwo-component system (i) \\(\\alpha(\\beta \\chi)\\), or (ii)\n\\(\\beta(\\chi \\alpha)\\) or (iii) \\(\\chi(\\alpha \\beta)\\). Suppose that, as a\nresult of this, in case (i) the system \\(\\alpha\\) has the definite-valued\nproperty \\(P\\), in case (ii) the system \\(\\beta\\) has the\ndefinite-valued property \\(Q\\), and in case (iii) the system\n\\(\\alpha \\beta\\) has the definite-valued property \\(R\\). How do the\ndefinite-valued properties of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) relate to those of\n\\(\\alpha \\beta\\)? Are the definite-values properties of system\n\\(\\alpha \\beta\\) \\(P \\amp Q\\), or \\(R\\), or both? \nThis problem has been addressed by different authors during the 1990s\n(see Vermaas 1999; Bacciagaluppi 1996). This work led to the\nspectral-decomposition modal interpretation (SDMI, sometimes known as\n“Vermaas-Dieks modal interpretation”, Vermaas and Dieks\n1995) a generalization of the BDMI interpretation to mixed states. The\nSDMI is based on the spectral decomposition of the reduced density\noperator: the definite-valued properties \\(\\Pi_i\\) of a system and\ntheir corresponding probabilities \\(\\mathrm{Pr}_i\\) are given by the non-zero\ndiagonal elements of the spectral decomposition of the system’s\nstate, \nThis new proposal matches the old one in cases where the old one\napplies, and generalizes it by fixing the definite-valued properties\nin terms of multi-dimensional projectors when the biorthogonal\ndecomposition is degenerate: definite-valued properties need not\nalways be represented by one-dimensional\nvectors—higher-dimensional subspaces of the Hilbert space can\nalso occur. \nThe SDMI also has a direct application to the measurement situation.\nConsider quantum measurement as described above, where the reduced\nstates of the measured system \\(S\\) and the measuring apparatus\n\\(M\\) are \nAccording to the SDMI, the preferred context of \\(S\\) is defined by\nthe projectors \\(\\Pi_i^a\\) and the preferred context of \\(M\\) is\ndefined by projectors \\(\\Pi_i^p\\).  Therefore, also in the SDMI, the\nobservables \\(A\\) of \\(S\\) and \\(P\\) of \\(M\\) acquire actual definite\nvalues, whose probabilities are given by the diagonal elements of the\ndiagonalized reduced states. \nThe SDMI faces the same difficulty as the non-relational version of\nthe BDMI: the fact that a system can be decomposed in a variety of\ndifferent ways. In particular, the factorization of a given Hilbert\nspace \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) into two factors, \\(\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{H}^1 \\otimes \\mathcal{H}^2\\), can be\n“rotated” to produce different factorizations \\(\\mathcal{H}' =\n\\mathcal{H}^1{}^\\prime \\otimes \\mathcal{H}^2{}^\\prime\\). Are we to apply the SDMI to each\nsuch factorization? How are the results related, if at all? A theorem\ndue to Bacciagaluppi (1995, see also Vermaas 1997) shows, in essence,\nthat if one applies the SDMI to the “subsystems” obtained\nin every factorization and insists that the definite-valued properties\nso-obtained are not relational, then one will be led to a mathematical\ncontradiction of the Kochen-Specker variety. In response, one could\nadopt the view that subsystems have their definite-valued properties\n“relative to a factorization”; we will come back to this\nissue below. \nHealey (1989) was also among the first to make use of the biorthogonal\ndecomposition theorem, developing these ideas in a somewhat different\ndirection. His main concern was the apparent non-locality of quantum\nmechanics. Healey’s intuition about the way a modal\ninterpretation based on the biorthogonal decomposition theorem would\nbe applied to, say, an EPR experiment is to implement the idea that an\nEPR pair possesses a “holistic” property; this can then\nexplain why the apparatus on one side of the experiment acquires a\nproperty that is correlated to the result on the other side. \nIn Healey’s proposal, the biorthogonal decomposition theorem is\nused, but the set of possible properties is subsequently modified in\norder to fulfill a variety of desiderata. The first is consistency:\nthe aim is to avoid Kochen-Specker-type results. A second is to\nmaintain a plausible theory of the relationship between composite\nsystems and their subsystems. A third is to maintain a plausible\naccount of the relations among definite-valued properties at a given\ntime. A fourth is to maintain a plausible account of the relations\namong definite-valued properties at different times. The structure of\ndefinite-valued properties that emerges from these conditions is\nextremely complicated. Some progress has been made since\nHealey’s book was published (see for example Reeder and Clifton\n1995) but, in general, it remains difficult to see what the set of\ndefinite-valued properties is according to his approach. \nAbove we suggested that the BDMI and the SDMI solve the measurement\nproblem in a particularly direct way. This is right in the case of the\nideal von Neumann measurement, as explained in the previous section,\nwhere the eigenstates \\(\\ket{a_i}\\) of an observable\n\\(A\\) of the measured system \\(S\\) are perfectly correlated\nwith the eigenstates \\(\\ket{p_i}\\) of the pointer\n\\(P\\) of the measuring apparatus \\(M\\). However, ideal\nmeasurement is a situation that can never be achieved in practice: the\ninteraction between \\(S\\) and \\(M\\) never introduces a\ncompletely perfect correlation. Two kinds of non-ideal measurements\nare usually distinguished in the literature: \nNote, however, that disturbing measurement can be rewritten as\nimperfect measurements (and vice versa). \nImperfect measurements pose a challenge to the BDMI and the SDMI,\nsince their rules for selecting the definite-valued properties do not\npick out the right properties for the apparatus in the imperfect case\n(see Albert and Loewer 1990, 1991, 1993; also Ruetsche 1995). An\nexample that clearly brings out the difficulties introduced by\nnon-ideal measurements was formulated in the context of Stern-Gerlach\nexperiments (Elby 1993). This argument uses the fact that the\nwavefunctions in the \\(z\\)-variable typically have infinite\n“tails” that introduce non-zero cross-terms; therefore,\nthe “tail” of the wavefunction of the “down”\nbeam may produce detection in the upper detector, and vice versa (see\nDickson 1994 for a detailed discussion). \nIn fact, if the biorthogonal decomposition is applied to the\nnon-perfectly correlated state \\(\\sum_{ij} d_{ij} \\ket{a_i} \\otimes\n\\ket{p_j} = \\sum_i c_i' \\ket{a_i'} \\otimes \\ket{p_i'}\\), according to\nthe BDMI the result does not select the pointer \\(P\\) as a\ndefinite-valued property, but a different observable \\(P'\\) with\neigenstates \\(\\ket{p_i'}\\). In this case, in which the definite-valued\nproperties selected by a modal interpretation are different from those\nexpected, the question arises how different they are. In the case of\nan imperfect measurement, it may be assumed that the \\(d_{ij} \\ne 0\\),\nwith \\(i \\ne j\\), be small; then, the difference might be also\nsmall. But in the case of a disturbing measurement, the \\(d_{ij} \\ne\n0\\), with \\(i \\ne j\\), need not be small and, as a consequence, the\ndisagreement between the modal interpretation assignment and the\nexperimental result might be unacceptable (see a full discussion in\nBacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1996).  This fact has been considered as a\n“silver bullet” for killing the modal interpretations\n(Harvey Brown, cited in Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1996). \nThere is another important problem related to non-ideal measurements.\nWhen the final state of the composite system (measured system plus\nmeasuring device) is very nearly degenerate when written in the basis\ngiven by the measured observable and the apparatus’s pointer\n(that is, when the probabilities for the various results are nearly\nequal), the spectral decomposition does not, in general, select as\ndefinite-valued properties close to those ideally expected. In fact,\nthe observables so selected may be incompatible (non-commuting) with\nthe observables that we expect on the basis of observation\n(Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1994, 1996). \nIn order to face the problems that non-ideal measurements pose to the\nBDMI and the SDMI, several authors have appealed to the phenomenon of\ndecoherence; this will be discussed below. \nLet us take a composite system \\(\\alpha \\beta\\), whose component\nsubsystems \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are represented by the Hilbert\nspaces \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\beta}\\), respectively, and consider a\nproperty represented by the projector \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) defined on\n\\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\alpha}\\). It is usual to assume that \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) represents\nthe same property as that represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes\nI^{\\beta}\\) defined on \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\alpha} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}^{\\beta}\\), where\n\\(I^{\\beta}\\) is the identity operator on \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\beta}\\). This\nassumption is based on the observational indistinguishability of the\nmagnitudes represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes\nI^{\\beta}\\): if the \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\)-measurement has a certain\noutcome, then the \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\)-measurement has\nexactly the same outcome. \nThe question is then: If the rules of the BDMI and the SDMI applied to\n\\(\\alpha\\) assign a value to \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\), do those rules applied\nto the composite system \\(\\alpha \\beta\\) assign the same value to\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) (condition known as Property\nComposition), and vice versa (Property Decomposition)? The answer to\nthis question is negative: the BDMI and the SDMI violate Property\nComposition and Property Decomposition (for a proof, see Vermaas\n1998). \nOf course, if one maintains that the projectors \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) and\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) represent the same property, the\nviolation of Property Composition and Property Decomposition is a\nserious problem for any interpretation. This is the position adopted\nby Arntzenius (1990), who judges this violation to be bizarre, since\nit assigns different truth values to propositions like ‘the\nleft-hand side of a table is green’ and ‘the table has a\ngreen left-hand side’, which are normally not distinguished; a\nsimilar argument is put forward by Clifton (1996, see also Clifton\n1995c). \nHowever, Vermaas (1998) argues that the observational\nindistinguishability of the magnitudes represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\)\nand \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) does not force one to consider\nthese two projectors as representing the same property: in fact, they\nare distinguishable from a theoretical viewpoint, since they are\ndefined on different Hilbert spaces. Moreover, he argues that the\nexamples developed by Arntzenius and Clifton sound bizarre precisely\nin the light of Property Composition and Property Decomposition. But\nin the quantum realm we must accept that the questions of which\nproperties are possessed by a system and which by its subsystems are\ndifferent questions: the properties of a composite system \\(\\alpha\n\\beta\\) don’t reveal information about the properties of\nsubsystem \\(\\alpha\\), and vice versa. Vermaas concludes that the tenet\nthat \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) do\nrepresent the same property can be viewed as an addition to quantum\nmechanics, which can be denied as, for instance, van Fraassen (1991)\ndid. \nAs we have seen, modal interpretations intend to provide, for every\ninstant, a set of definite-valued properties and their probabilities.\nSome advocates of modal interpretations may be willing to leave the\nmatter, more or less, at that. Others take it to be crucial for any\nmodal interpretation that it also answers questions of the form: Given\nthat the property \\(P\\) of a system has the actual value \\(\\alpha\\) at\ntime \\(t_0\\), what is the probability that its property \\(P'\\) has the\nactual value \\(\\beta\\) at time \\(t_1 \\gt t_0\\)? In other words, they\nwant a dynamics of actual properties. \nThere are arguments on both sides. Those who argue for the necessity\nof such a dynamics maintain that we have to assure that the\ntrajectories of actual properties really are, at\nleast for macroscopic objects, like we see them to be, i.e., like the\nrecords contained in memories. For example, we should require not only\nthat the book at rest on the desk possess a definite location, but\nalso that, if undisturbed, its location relative to the desk does not\nchange in time. Accordingly, one cannot get away with simply\nspecifying the definite properties at each instant of time. We need\nalso to show that this specification is at least compatible with a\nreasonable dynamics; better still, specify this dynamics\nexplicitly. \nThose who consider a dynamics of actual properties to be superfluous\nreply that such a dynamics is more than what an interpretation of\nquantum mechanics needs to provide. Memory contents for each instant\nare enough to make empirical adequacy possible. \nAs pointed out by Ruetsche (2003), in this debate about the need for a\ndynamics of actual properties it is important whether the modal\ninterpretation is viewed as leading to a hidden-variables\ntheory, in which value states are added as hidden variables to\nthe original formalism in order to obtain a full description of the\nphysical situation, or rather as only equipping the original formalism\nwith a new semantics. In the first approach one would expect a full\ndynamics of actual properties, in the second this is not so clear. \nOf course, modal interpretations do admit a trivial dynamics, namely,\none in which there is no correlation from one time to the next. In\nthis case, the probability of a transition from the property \\(P\\)\nhaving the actual value \\(\\alpha\\) at \\(t_0\\), to the property \\(P'\\)\nhaving the actual value \\(\\beta\\) at \\(t_1 \\gt t_0\\) is just the\nsingle-time probability for \\(P'\\) having \\(\\beta\\) at\n\\(t_1\\). However, this dynamics is unlikely to interest those who feel\nthe need for a dynamics at all. Several researchers have contributed\nto the project of constructing a more interesting form of dynamics for\nmodal interpretations (see Vermaas 1996, 1998).  An important account\nis due to Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999, see also Bacciagaluppi\n1998). That work shows the most significant challenges that the\nconstruction of a dynamics of actual properties must face. \nThe first challenge is posed by the fact that the set of\ndefinite-valued properties—let us call it\n‘\\(S\\)’—may change over time. One therefore has to\ndefine a family of maps, each one being a 1–1 map from \\(S_0\\)\nat time \\(t_0\\) to a different \\(S_t\\) at time \\(t\\), for any\ntime. With such a family of maps, one can effectively define\nconditional probabilities within a single state space, and then\ntranslate them into “transition” probabilities. For this\ntechnique to work, \\(S_t\\) must have the same cardinality at any time.\nHowever, in general this is not the case: for instance, in the SDMI,\nthe number of different projectors appearing in the spectral\ndecomposition of the density matrix may vary with time. \nA way out of this is to augment \\(S\\) at each time so that its\ncardinality matches the highest cardinality that \\(S\\) ever\nachieves. Of course, one hopes to do so in a way that is not\ncompletely ad hoc. For example, in the context of the SDMI,\nBacciagaluppi, Donald and Vermaas (1995) show that the\n“trajectory” through Hilbert space of the spectral\ncomponents of the reduced state of a physical system will, under\nreasonable conditions, be continuous, or have only isolated\ndiscontinuities, so that the trajectory can be naturally extended to a\ncontinuous trajectory (see also Donald 1998). This result suggests a\nnatural family of maps as discussed above: map each spectral component\nat one time to its unique continuous evolved component at later\ntimes. \nThe second challenge to the construction of a dynamics arises from the\nfact that one wants to define transition probabilities over\ninfinitesimal units of time, and then derive the finite-time\ntransition probabilities from them. Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999)\nargue that, adapting results from the theory of stochastic processes,\none can show that the procedure may, more or less, be carried out for\nmodal interpretations of at least some varieties. \nFinally, one must actually define infinitesimal transition\nprobabilities that will give rise to the proper quantum-mechanical\nprobabilities at each time. Following earlier papers by Bell (1984),\nVink (1993) and others, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999) define an\ninfinite class of such infinitesimal transition probabilities, such\nthat all of them generate the correct single-time probabilities, which\narguably are all we can really test. However, Sudbery (2002) has\ncontended that the form of the transition probabilities would be\nrelevant to the precise form of spontaneous decay or the\n“Dehmelt quantum jumps”; he independently developed the\ndynamics of Bacciagaluppi and Dickson and applied it in such a way\nthat it leads to the correct predictions for these experiments.\nGambetta and Wiseman (2003, 2004) developed a dynamical modal account\nin the form of a non-Markovian process with noise, also extending\ntheir approach to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). More\nrecently, Hollowood (2013a, 2013b, 2014) has elaborated the idea that\nthe dynamics of value states can be modeled by a discrete-time Markov\nchain. \nAs we have seen, both the SDMI and the non-relational version of the\nBDMI have to face the problem of the multiple factorizability of a\ngiven Hilbert space: if the definite-valued properties are monadic\n(i.e., non-relational), both interpretations led to a\nKochen-Specker-type contradiction (Bacciagaluppi 1995). This points to\nthe direction of an interpretation that makes properties relational,\nin this case relative to a factorization. \nExtending this idea, a perspectival modal interpretation (PMI, Bene\nand Dieks 2002) was developed, in which the properties of a physical\nsystem have a relational character and are defined with respect to\nanother physical system that serves as a “reference\nsystem” (see Bene 1997). This interpretation is similar in\nspirit to the idea that systems have properties as\n“witnessed” by the rest of the universe (Kochen 1985).\nHowever, the PMI goes further by defining states of a system not only\nwith respect to the universe, but also with respect to arbitrary\nlarger systems. The PMI is closely related to the SDMI since similar\nrules are used to assign properties to quantum systems. \nIn the PMI, the state of any system \\(S\\) needs the specification of a\n“reference system” \\(R\\) with respect to which the state\nis defined: this state of \\(S\\) with respect to \\(R\\) is denoted by\n\\(\\varrho_{R}^{S}\\). In the special case in which \\(R\\) coincides with\n\\(S\\), the state \\(\\varrho_{S}^{S}\\) is called “the state of\nS with respect to itself”. If the system \\(S\\) is contained\nin a system \\(A\\), the state \\(\\varrho_{A}^{S}\\) is defined as the\ndensity operator that can be derived from \\(\\varrho_{A}^{A}\\) by\ntaking the partial trace over the degrees of freedom in \\(A\\) that do\nnot pertain to \\(S\\): \nWith these definitions, the point of departure of the PMI is the\nquantum state of the whole universe with respect to itself, which it\nis assumed to be a pure state \\(\\varrho_{U}^{U} = \\ket{\\psi}\n\\bra{\\psi}\\) which evolves unitarily according to the Schrödinger\nequation. For any system \\(S\\) contained in the universe, its state\nwith respect to itself \\(\\varrho_{S}^{S}\\) is postulated to be one of\nthe projectors of the spectral resolution of \nIn particular, if there is no degeneracy among the eigenvalues of\n\\(\\varrho_{U}^{S}\\), these projectors are one-dimensional and\n\\(\\varrho_{S}^{S}\\) is the one-dimensional projector\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{S}} \\bra{\\psi_{S}}\\). \nWithin this PMI conceptual framework it can be shown that a system may\nbe localized from the perspective of one observer and, nevertheless,\nmay be delocalized from a different perspective. But it also follows\nthat observers who look at the same macroscopic object, at the same\ntime and under identical circumstances, will see it (practically) at\nthe same spot. \nThe core idea of this interpretation is that all different relational\ndescriptions, given from different perspectives, are equally objective\nand all correspond to physical reality (which has a relational\ncharacter itself). We cannot explain the relational states by\nappealing to a definition in terms of more basic non-relational\nstates. Further analysis shows that in this interpretation EPR-type\nsituations can be understood in a basically local manner. Indeed, the\nchange in the relational state of particle 2 with respect to the\n2-particle system can be understood as a consequence of the change in\nthe reference system brought about by the local measurement\ninteraction between particle 1 and the measuring device. This local\nmeasurement is responsible for the creation of a new perspective, and\nfrom this new perspective there is a new relational state of particle\n2 (see also Dieks 2009). \nThe PMI agrees with Bohr’s qualitative argument that any\nreasonable definition of physical reality in the quantum realm should\ninclude the experimental setup. However, the PMI is more general in\nthe sense that the state of a system is defined with respect to any\nlarger physical system, not necessarily an instrument. This removes\nthe threat of subjectivism, since the relational states follow\nunambiguously from the quantum formalism and the physics of the\nsituation. \nIt is interesting to consider the connections between the PMI and\nother relational proposals. For instance, Berkovitz and Hemmo (2006)\npropose the prospects of a relational modal interpretation in the\nrelativistic case (we will come back to this point below). In turn,\nRovelli and coworkers propose an explicit ‘relational quantum\nmechanics’ that emphasizes the possibility of different\ndescriptions of a physical system depending on the perspective\n(Rovelli 1996; Rovelli and Smerlak 2007; Laudisa and Rovelli 2008; see\nalso van Fraassen 2010 and the entry on\n relational quantum mechanics).\n In spite of the points of contact between the PMI and Rovelli’s\nrelational interpretation, there are significant differences. In\nRovelli’s proposal, the concepts of measurement interaction and\nof definite outcomes of measurements are primary; moreover, the state\nhas to be updated every time that a measurement event occurs and, as a\nconsequence, it changes discontinuously with every new event. On the\ncontrary, the PMI is a realist interpretation where a measurement is\nnothing else than a quantum interaction, and where unitary evolution\nis the main dynamical principle, also when systems interact (see Dieks\n2009). \nAs Bub (1997) points out, in most modal interpretations the preferred\ncontext of definite-valued observables depends on the state of the\nsystem. An exception is Bohmian mechanics, in which the preferred\ncontext is a priori defined by the position observable; in this case,\nproperty composition and property decomposition hold. But this is not\nthe only reasonable possibility for a modal interpretation with a\nfixed preferred observable. In fact, the modal-Hamiltonian\ninterpretation (MHI, Lombardi and Castagnino 2008; Ardenghi,\nCastagnino, and Lombardi 2009; Lombardi, Castagnino, and Ardenghi\n2010; Ardenghi and Lombardi 2011) endows the Hamiltonian of a system\nwith a determining role, both in the definition of systems and\nsubsystems and in the selection of the preferred context. \nThe MHI is based on the following postulates: \nSystems postulate (SP):\nA quantum system \\(S\\) is represented by a pair \\((\\mathcal{O}, H)\\)\nsuch that (i) \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) is a space of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert\nspace, representing the observables of the system, (ii) \\(H \\in \\mathcal{O}\\) is\nthe time-independent Hamiltonian of the system \\(S\\), and (iii) if\n\\(\\varrho_0 \\in \\mathcal{O}'\\) (where \\(\\mathcal{O}'\\) is the dual space of \\(\\mathcal{O})\\) is the\ninitial state of \\(S\\), it evolves according to the Schrödinger\nequation. \nAlthough any quantum system can be decomposed in parts in many ways,\naccording to the MHI a decomposition leads to parts which are also\nquantum systems only when the components’ behaviors are dynamically\nindependent of each other, that is, when there is no interaction among\nthe subsystems: \nComposite systems postulate (CSP):\nA quantum system represented by \\(S: (\\mathcal{O}, H)\\), with initial state\n\\(\\varrho_0 \\in \\mathcal{O}'\\), is composite when it can be partitioned\ninto two quantum systems \\(S^1 : (\\mathcal{O}^1, H^1)\\) and \\(S^2 : (\\mathcal{O}^2, H^2)\\)\nsuch that (i) \\(\\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}^1 \\otimes \\mathcal{O}^2\\), and (ii) \\(H = H^1 \\otimes I^2 + I^1 \\otimes H^2\\) (where \\(I^1\\) and \\(I^2\\) are the identity\noperators in the corresponding tensor product spaces). In this case,\nwe say that \\(S^1\\) and \\(S^2\\) are subsystems of the\ncomposite system \\(S = S^1 \\cup S^2\\). If the system is not composite,\nit is elemental.\n \nWith respect to the preferred context, the basic idea of the MHI is\nthat the Hamiltonian of the system defines actualization. Any\nobservable that does not have the symmetries of the Hamiltonian cannot\nacquire a definite actual value, since this actualization would break\nthe symmetry of the system in an arbitrary way. \nActualization rule (AR): \nGiven an elemental quantum system represented by \\(S: (\\mathcal{O}, H)\\), the\nactual-valued observables of \\(S\\) are \\(H\\) and all the observables\ncommuting with \\(H\\) and having, at least, the same symmetries as\n\\(H\\). \nThe selection of the preferred context exclusively on the basis of a\npreferred observable has been criticized by arguing that in the\nHilbert space formalism all observables are on an equal footing.\nHowever, quantum mechanics is not just Hilbert space mathematics: it\nis a physical theory that includes a dynamical law in which the\nHamiltonian is singled out to play a central role. \nThe justification for selecting the Hamiltonian as the preferred\nobservable ultimately lies in the success of the MHI and its ability\nto solve interpretive difficulties. With respect to the first point:\nthe scheme has been applied to several well-known physical situations\n(free particle with spin, harmonic oscillator, free hydrogen atom,\nZeeman effect, fine structure, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation),\nleading to results consistent with empirical evidence (Lombardi and\nCastagnino 2008, Section 5). With respect to interpretation, the MHI\nconfronts quantum contextuality by selecting a preferred context, and\nhas proved to be able to supply an account of the measurement problem,\nboth in its ideal and its non-ideal versions; moreover, in the\nnon-ideal case it gives a criterion to distinguish between reliable\nand non-reliable measurements (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008, Section\n6), a criterion that can be generalized when expressed in\ninformational terms (Lombardi, Fortin and López 2015). \nIn the MHI property composition and property decomposition hold\nbecause the actualization rule only applies to elemental\nsystems: the definite-valued properties of composite systems are\nselected on the basis of those of the elemental components, and\nfollowing the usual quantum assumption according to which the\nobservable \\(A^1\\) of a subsystem \\(S^1\\) and the observable \\(A = A^1\n\\otimes I^2\\) of the composite system \\(S = S^1 \\cup S^2\\) represent\nthe same property (Ardenghi and Lombardi 2011). \nThe preferred context of the MHI does not change with time: the\ndefinite-valued observables always commute with the Hamiltonian and,\ntherefore, they are constants of motion of the system. This means that\nthey are the same during the whole “life” of the quantum\nsystem as a closed system, since its initial “birth”, when\nit arises as a result of an interaction, up to its final\n“death”, when it disappears by interacting with another\nsystem. As a consequence, there is no need of accounting for the\ndynamics of the actual properties as in the BDMI and the SDMI. \nIn more recent years, the MHI has extended its applications to further\nsituations, such as the non-collapse account of consecutive\nmeasurements in physics (Ardenghi, Lombardi and Narvaja 2013) and the\nproblem of optical isomerism in chemistry (Fortin, Lombardi and\nMartínez González 2016a, 2016b). Moreover, on the basis\nof its closed-system perspective, the MHI opens the way toward a\ntop-down view of quantum mechanics, according to which reduced states\nare coarse-grained states of a closed system (Fortin and Lombardi\n2014) and decoherence is a phenomenon relative to the particular\npartition of the closed system considered in each case (Lombardi,\nFortin and Castagnino 2012, Fortin and Lombardi 2016). \nOne of the leading ideas of the modal interpretations is\nprobabilism: quantum mechanics does not correspond in a\none-to-one way to actual reality, but rather provides us with a list\nof possibilities and their probabilities. Therefore, the notions of\npossibility and probability are central in this interpretive\nframework. This raises two issues: the formal treatment of\nprobabilities, and the interpretation of probability. \nSince the set of events corresponding to all projector operators on a\ngiven Hilbert space does not have a Boolean structure, the Born\nprobability (which is defined over these projectors) does not satisfy\nthe definition of probability of Kolmogorov (which applies to a\nBoolean algebra of events). For this reason, some authors define a\ngeneralized non-Kolmogorovian probability function over the\northo-algebra of quantum events (Hughes 1989; Cohen 1989). Modal\ninterpretations do not follow this path: they conceive probabilities\nas represented by a Kolmogorovian measure on the Boolean algebra\nrepresenting the definite-valued quantities, generated by mutually\ncommuting projectors. The various modal interpretations differ from\neach other in their definitions of the preferred context on which the\nKolmogorovian probability is defined. \nAs we have seen, the definite-valued properties of a system are\nusually characterized in terms of the quantum state \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) and\na privileged observable \\(\\boldsymbol{R}\\) (Bub and Clifton 1996; Bub,\nClifton, and Goldstein 2000; Dieks 2005). Dieks (2007) derives a\nuniqueness result, namely that given the splitting of a total Hilbert\nspace into two factors spaces, representing the system and its\nenvironment, respectively, the Boolean lattice of definite-valued\nobservables is fixed by the state of the system alone.  Furthermore,\nit follows that the Born measure is the only one that is definable\nfrom just the product structure of Hilbert space, the state in the\nHilbert space, and the definite-valued observables selected by the\nstate. \nThe MHI defines a context as a complete set of orthogonal projectors\n\\(\\{\\Pi_{\\alpha}\\}\\), such that \\(\\sum_{i} \\Pi_{i} = I\\) and\n\\(\\Pi_{i}\\Pi_j = \\delta_{ij}\\Pi_{i}\\), where\n\\(I\\) is the identity operator in \\(\\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}\\).\nSince each context generates a Boolean structure, the state of the\nsystem defines a Kolmogorovian probability function on each individual\ncontext (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008). However, only the\nprobabilities defined on the context determined by the eigenprojectors\nof the Hamiltonian of an elemental closed system correspond to the\npossible values one of which becomes actual. \nIn modal interpretations the event space on which the (preferred)\nprobability measure is defined is a space of possible events,\namong which only one becomes actual. The fact that the actual event is\nnot singled out by these interpretations is what makes them\nfundamentally probabilistic. This aspect distinguishes modal\ninterpretations from many-worlds interpretations, where the\nprobability measure is defined on a space of events that are all\nactual. Nevertheless, this does not mean that all modal\ninterpretations agree about the interpretation of probability. \nIn the context of the BDMI, the SDMI and the PMI, it is usually\nclaimed that, given the space of possible events, the state generates\nan ignorance-interpretable probability measure over this set: quantum\nprobabilities quantify the ignorance of the observer about the actual\nvalues acquired by the system’s observables (see, e.g., Dieks\n1988; Clifton 1995a; Vermaas 1999; Bene and Dieks 2002). \nBy contrast to actualism—the conception that reduces possibility\nto actuality (see Dieks 2010, Bueno 2014)—some modal\ninterpretations, in particular the MHI, adopt a possibilist\nconception, according to which possible\nevents—possibilia—constitute a basic ontological\ncategory (see Menzel 2007). The probability measure is in this case\nseen as a representation of an ontological propensity of a possible\nquantum event to become actual (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008; see also\nSuárez 2004). \nThese views do not all exclude each other. If probabilities quantify\nignorance about the actual values of the observables, this need not\nmean that this ignorance can be removed by the addition of further\ninformation. If quantum probabilities are ontological propensities,\nour ignorance about the possible event that becomes actual is a\nnecessary consequence of the indeterministic nature of the system\nbecause there simply is no additional information specifying a more\naccurate state of the system. \nAccording to the environment-induced approach to decoherence (Zurek\n1981, 2003; see also Schlosshauer 2007), the measuring apparatus is an\nopen system in continuous interaction with its environment; as a\nconsequence of this interaction, the reduced state of the apparatus\nand the measured system becomes, almost instantaneously,\nindistinguishable from a state that would represent an ignorance\nmixture (“proper mixture”) over unknown values of the\napparatus’ pointer. The idea that decoherence might play a role in\nmodal interpretations was proposed by several authors early on (Dieks\n1989b; Healey 1995). But it has acquired a central relevance in\nrelation to the discussion of non-ideal measurements in the modal\ninterpretation. \nAs we have seen, in the BDMI and the SDMI, the biorthogonal or the\nspectral decomposition does not pick out the right properties for the\napparatus in non-ideal measurements. Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo (1996)\nshow that, when the apparatus is a finite-dimensional system in\ninteraction with an environment with a huge number of degrees of\nfreedom, decoherence guarantees that the spectral decomposition of the\napparatus’ reduced state will be very close to the ideally expected\nresult and, as a consequence, the apparatus’ pointer\nis—approximately—selected as an actual definite-valued\nobservable. Alternatively, Bub (1997) proposes that it is not\ndecoherence—with the “tracing out” of the\nenvironment and the diagonalization of the reduced state of the\napparatus—that is relevant for the definite value of the\npointer, but the triorthogonal or \\(n\\)-orthogonal decomposition\ntheorem, since it singles out a unique pointer basis for the\napparatus. \nIn either case, the interaction with the environment is a great help\nto the BDMI and the SDMI for handling non-ideal measurements with\nfinite-dimensional apparatuses. However, the case of\ninfinitely many distinct states for the apparatus is more\ntroublesome. Bacciagaluppi (2000) has analyzed this situation, using a\ncontinuous model of the apparatus’ interaction with the environment.\nHe concludes that in this case the spectral decomposition of the\nreduced state of the apparatus generally does not pick out states that\nare close enough to the ideally expected state. This result seems to\napply also to other cases where a macroscopic system (not described as\nfinite-dimensional) experiences decoherence due to interaction with\nits environment (see Donald 1998). However, model calculations in\nperspectival versions of the modal interpretation (Bene and Dieks\n2002; Hollowood 2013a, 2013b, 2014) indicate that the problem is less\nsevere in realistic circumstances than originally supposed. \nAs said above, in the case of the MHI decoherence is not explicitly\nappealed to in order to account for the definite reading of the\napparatus’ pointer (neither in ideal nor in non-ideal measurements).\nHowever, there still is a relation with the decoherence program. In\nfact, the measuring apparatus is always a macroscopic system with a\nhuge number of degrees of freedom, and the pointer must be a\n“collective” and empirically accessible observable; as a\nconsequence, the many degrees of freedom corresponding to the\ndegeneracies of the pointer play the role of a decohering\n“internal environment” (for details, see Lombardi 2010;\nLombardi et al. 2011). The role of decoherence in the MHI becomes\nclearer when the phenomenon of decoherence is understood from a\nclosed-system perspective (Castagnino, Laura, and Lombardi 2007;\nCastagnino, Fortin, and Lombardi 2010; Lombardi, Fortin, and\nCastagnino 2012). (See the entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics.) \nThere are a number of open problems and perspectives in the modal\nprogram. Here we will consider some of them. \nModal interpretations are based on the standard formalism of quantum\nmechanics (in the Hilbert space version or in the algebraic version).\nHowever, Brown, Suárez and Bacciagaluppi (1998) argue that\nthere is more to quantum reality than what is described by\noperators and quantum states: they claim that gauges and coordinate\nsystems are important to our description of physical reality as well,\nwhile modal interpretations (AM, BDMI and SDMI) have standardly not\ntaken such things into consideration. In a similar vein, it has been\nargued that the Galilean space-time symmetries endow the formal\nskeleton of quantum mechanics with the physical flesh and blood that\nidentify the fundamental physical magnitudes and that allow the theory\nto be applied to concrete physical situations (Lombardi and Castagnino\n2008). The set of definite-valued observables of a system should be\nleft invariant by the Galilean transformations: it would be\nunacceptable that this set changed as a mere result of a change in the\nperspective from which the system is described. On the basis of this\nidea, the MHI rule of actualization has been reformulated in an\nexplicitly invariant form, in terms of the Casimir operators of the\nGalilean group (Ardenghi, Castagnino, and Lombardi 2009; Lombardi,\nCastagnino, and Ardenghi 2010). \nAnother fundamental question is the relativistic extension of the\nmodal approach. Dickson and Clifton (1998) have shown that a large\nclass of modal interpretations of ordinary quantum mechanics cannot be\nmade Lorentz-invariant in a straightforward way (see also Myrvold\n2002). With respect to the extension to algebraic quantum field theory\n(see Dieks 2002; Kitajima 2004), Clifton (2000) proposed a natural\ngeneralization of the non-relativistic modal scheme, but Earman and\nRuetsche (2005) showed that it is not yet clear whether it will be\nable to deal with measurement situations and whether it is empirically\nadequate. The problems revealed by these investigations are due to the\nnon-relativistic nature of the formalism of quantum mechanics that is\nemployed, in particular to the fact that the concept of a state of an\nextended system at one instant is central. In a local\nfield-theoretic context this becomes different, and this may avoid\nconflicts with relativity (Earman and Ruetsche 2005). Berkovitz and\nHemmo (2005) and Hemmo and Berkovitz (2005) propose a different way\nout: they argue that perspectivalism can come to the rescue here (see\nalso Berkovitz and Hemmo 2006). In turn, in the context of the MHI, it\nhas been argued that the actualization rule, expressed in terms of the\nCasimir operators of the Galilean group in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics, can be transferred to the relativistic domain by changing\nthe symmetry group accordingly: the definite-valued observables of a\nsystem would be those represented by the Casimir operators of the\nPoincaré group. Since the mass operator and the squared spin\noperator are the only Casimir operators of the Poincaré group,\nthey would always be definite-valued observables. This conclusion\nwould be in agreement with a usual assumption in quantum field theory:\nelemental particles always have definite values of mass and spin, and\nthose values are precisely what define the different kinds of\nelemental particles of the theory (Lombardi and Fortin 2015). \nThere are also specifically philosophical issues concerning\nontological matters: about the nature of the items referred to by\nquantum mechanics, that is, about the basic categories of the quantum\nontology. As we have seen, in general the properties of quantum\nsystems are considered to be monadic, with the exception of the\nrelational version of the BDMI and the PMI where these properties are\nrelational. In any case, it might be asked whether a quantum system\nhas to be conceived as an individual substratum supporting properties\nor as a mere “bundle” of properties. Following an original\nidea of Lombardi and Castagnino (2008), da Costa, Lombardi and Lastiri\n(2013) and da Costa and Lombardi (2014) have suggested that, in the\nmodal context, the bundle view might be appropriate to supply an\nanswer to the problem of indistinguishability (see also French and\nKrause 2006). Nevertheless, this quantum ontology of propertied does\nnot prevent the emergence of particles under certain particular\ncircumstances (see Lombardi and Dieks 2016). \nRecently, modal interpretations have begun to be considered by\npracticing physicists and mathematicians interested in foundational\nmatters. For instance, Hollowood (2014) offers an interpretation of\nquantum mechanics inspired by the perspectival modal interpretation:\nthe state of an open system describes its properties from the\nperspective of the closed system of which it is a sub-system. In turn,\nBarandes and Kagan (2014a, 2014b) propose a “minimal modal\ninterpretation”, inspired by the SDMI, according to which the\npreferred context is given by the evolving reduced state of the open\nsystem. Nakayama (2008a, 2008b) has explored connections between the\nmodal interpretation and the framework of topos theory. \nThese and similar developments have arisen in the context of detailed\ntechnical investigations. This illustrates one of the advantages of\nthe modal approach: it makes use of a precise set of rules that\ndetermine the set of definite-valued observables, and this makes it\npossible to derive rigorous results. It may well be that several of\nthese results, e.g., no-go theorems, can be applied to other\ninterpretations as well (e.g., to the many-worlds interpretation, see\nDieks 2007). Whatever the merit of the modal ideas in the end, one can\nat least say that they have given rise to a serious and fruitful\nseries of investigations into the nature of quantum theory.","contact.mail":"olimpiafilo@arnet.com.ar","contact.domain":"arnet.com.ar"},{"date.published":"2002-11-12","date.changed":"2017-03-06","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-modal/","author1":"Olimpia Lombardi","author2":"Dennis Dieks","entry":"qm-modal","body.text":"\n\n\nThe original “modal interpretation” of non-relativistic\nquantum theory was born in the early 1970s, and at that time the\nphrase referred to a single interpretation. The phrase now encompasses\na class of interpretations, and is better taken to refer to a\ngeneral approach to the interpretation of quantum theory. We shall\ndescribe the history of modal interpretations, how the phrase has come\nto be used in this way, and the general program of (at least some of)\nthose who advocate this approach.\n\nIn traditional approaches to quantum measurement theory a central role\nis played by the projection postulate, which asserts that upon\nmeasurement of a physical system its state will be projected\n(“collapses”) onto a state corresponding to the value\nfound in the measurement. However, this postulate leads to many\ndifficulties: What causes this discontinuous change in the physical\nstate of a system? What exactly is a “measurement” as\nopposed to an ordinary physical interaction? The postulate is\nespecially worrying when applied to entangled compound systems whose\ncomponents are well-separated in space. For example, in the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment there are strict correlations\nbetween two systems that have interacted in the past, in spite of the\nfact that the correlated quantities are not sharply defined in the\nindividual systems. The projection postulate in this case implies that\nthe collapse resulting from a measurement on one of the systems\ninstantaneously defines a sharp property in the distant other system.\n(See the discussion of the collapse or projection postulate in the\nentry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory.) \nA possible way clear of these problems was noticed by van Fraassen\n(1972, 1974, 1991), who proposed to eliminate the projection postulate\nfrom the theory. Others had made this proposal before, as Bohm (1952)\nin his theory (itself preceded by de Broglie’s proposals from\nthe 1920s), Everett (1957) in his relative-state interpretation and De\nWitt (1970) with the many-worlds interpretation. (See the entries on\n Bohmian mechanics,\n Everett’s relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics, and the\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.)\n Van Fraassen’s proposal was, however, different from these\nother approaches. It relied, in particular, on a distinction between\nwhat he called the “dynamical state” and the “value\nstate” of a system at any instant: \nThe dynamical state is just the quantum state of the ordinary textbook\napproach (a vector or density matrix in Hilbert space). For an\nisolated system, it always evolves according to the\nSchrödinger equation (in non-relativistic quantum mechanics): so\nthe dynamical state never collapses during its evolution. \nThe value state is (typically) different from the dynamical state. The\ngeneral idea of this original proposal, and of modal interpretations\nin general, is that physical systems at all times possess a number of\nwell-defined physical properties, i.e., definite values of physical\nquantities; these properties can be represented by the system’s\nvalue state. Which physical quantities are sharply defined, and which\nvalues they take, may change in time. Empirical adequacy of course\nrequires that the dynamical state generate the correct Born\nfrequencies of observable quantities. \nAn essential feature of this approach is that a system may have a\nsharp value of an observable even if the dynamical state is not an\neigenstate of that same observable. The proposal thus violates the\nso-called “eigenstate-eigenvalue link”, which says that a\nsystem can only have a sharp value of an observable (namely, one of\nits eigenvalues) if its quantum state is the corresponding eigenstate.\nIn the value state terminology, the eigenstate-eigenvalue link would\nsay that a system has the value state corresponding to a given\neigenvalue of a given observable if and only if its dynamical state is\nan eigenstate of the observable corresponding to that eigenvalue. This\noriginal modal approach accepts the “if” part, but denies\nthe “only if” part. \nWhat are the possible “value states” for a given system at\na given time? Van Fraassen stipulates the following restriction:\npropositions about a physical system cannot be jointly true, unless\nthey are represented by commuting observables. In other words, the\nnon-commutativity of observables imposes limits not on our\nknowledge about the properties of a system, but rather on the\npossibility of joint existence of properties, independently\nof our knowledge. Non-commuting quantities, like position and\nmomentum, cannot jointly be well-defined quantities of a physical\nsystem. \nEmpirical adequacy requires that, in cases of measurement, the\nafter-measurement value state of the apparatus corresponds to the\n(definite) measurement result. Therefore, in these cases one would\nexpect the dynamical state to generate a probability measure over\nexactly the set of possible measurement results. However, van\nFraassen’s original modal approach is more liberal in its\nassignment of possible value states, and according to many this does\nnot yield a satisfactory account of measurements (see Ruetsche\n1996). \nVan Fraassen’s proposal is “modal” because it\nnaturally connects to a modal logic of quantum propositions. Indeed,\nthe dynamical state in general only tells us what is\npossible. According to van Fraassen, one does not need to\nview this as arising from an incompleteness of the description, which\nit is the aim of science to remove—quantum mechanics may be\ninherently probabilistic and modal (see Bueno 2014 for the relation\nbetween this and van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism, which is\nhostile to modal realism). \nIt is easy to see how, along the lines of van Fraassen’s ideas,\na program could come into being for providing a more elaborate\n“realist” interpretation of quantum theory, a program to\nwhich we now turn. \nIn the 1980s several authors presented realist interpretations which,\nin retrospect, can be regarded as elaborations or variations on the\njust-mentioned modal themes (for an overview and references, see Dieks\nand Vermaas 1998). In spite of the differences among them, all the\nmodal interpretations agree on the following points: \nThe Kochen-Specker theorem (1967) is a barrier to any realist\nclassical-like interpretation of quantum mechanics, since it proves\nthe impossibility of ascribing precise values to all physical\nquantities (observables) of a quantum system simultaneously, while\npreserving the functional relations between commuting observables.\n(See the entry on the\n the Kochen-Specker theorem.)\n Therefore, realist non-collapse interpretations are committed to\nselecting a privileged set of definite-valued observables out of all\nobservables. Each modal interpretation thus supplies a “rule of\ndefinite-value ascription” or “actualization rule”,\nwhich picks out, from the set of all observables of a quantum system,\nthe subset of definite-valued properties. \nThe question is: what should this actualization rule look like? Since\nthe mid-1990s a series of approaches faced this question (Clifton\n1995a,b; Dickson 1995a,b; Dieks 1995). Each one of them proposed a\ngroup of conditions that the set of definite-valued properties should\nobey, and characterized this set in terms of the dynamical state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) of the system. The common result was that the possible\nvalue states of the components of a two-part composite system are\ngiven by the states occurring in the Schmidt (bi-orthogonal)\ndecomposition of the dynamical state, or, equivalently, by the\nprojectors occurring in the spectral decomposition of the density\nmatrices representing partial systems (obtained by partial\ntracing)—see Section 4 for more details. \nThe definite-valued properties have also been characterized somewhat\ndifferently (Bub and Clifton 1996; for an improved version, see Bub,\nClifton and Goldstein 2000), that is, in terms of the quantum state\n\\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) plus a “privileged observable”\n\\(\\boldsymbol{R}\\), which is privileged in the sense that it\nrepresents a property that is always definite-valued (see also Dieks\n2005, 2007). On this basis, Bub (1992, 1994, 1997) suggests that with\nhindsight a number of traditional interpretations of quantum theory\ncan be characterized as modal interpretations. Notable among them are\nthe Dirac-von Neumann interpretation, (what Bub takes to be)\nBohr’s interpretation, and Bohm’s theory. Bohm’s\ntheory is a modal interpretation in which the privileged observable\n\\(\\boldsymbol{R}\\) is the position observable. \nThe Hilbert space of the universe \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\univ}\\),\nlike any Hilbert space, can be factorized in countless ways. If one\nsupposes that each factorization defines a legitimate set of\nsubsystems of the universe, the multiple factorizability implies that\nthere exists a multiplicity of ways of defining the building blocks of\nnature. If the properties (value states) of all these quantum systems\nare defined by means of the partial trace with respect to the rest of\nthe universe (see later for more details), it turns out that a\ncontradiction of the Kochen-Specker type arises (Bacciagaluppi\n1995). \nThe Atomic Modal Interpretation (AMI, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson 1999)\ntries to overcome this obstacle by assuming that there is in nature a\nfixed set of mutually disjoint atomic quantum systems\n\\(S^j\\) that constitute the building blocks of\nall the other quantum systems. From the mathematical point of view,\nthis means that the Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\univ}\\) of\nthe entire universe can only be meaningfully factorized in a single\nway, which defines a preferred factorization. If each atomic\nquantum system \\(S^j\\) is represented by its\ncorresponding Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^j\\), then the\nHilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\univ}\\) of the universe must be\nwritten as \nThe main appeal of this idea is that it is in consonance with the\nstandard model of particle physics, where the fundamental blocks of\nnature are the elemental particles, e.g., quarks, electrons, photons,\netc., and their interactions. The property ascription to the atomic\nquantum systems in the AMI further follows the general idea of modal\ninterpretations, that is, the ascription depends via a fixed rule on\nthe dynamical state of the system. \nThe main challenge for the AMI is to justify the assumption that there\nis a preferred partition of the universe and to provide some idea\nabout what this factorization should look like. AMI also faces a\nconceptual problem. In this interpretation, a non-atomic quantum\nsystem \\(S^{\\sigma}\\), defined as composite of atomic quantum systems,\ndoes not necessarily have properties that correspond to the outcomes\nof measurements. The reason is that the system \\(S^{\\sigma}\\) might be\nin the quantum state \\(\\varrho^{\\sigma}\\) with an eigenprojector\n\\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\) such that\n\\(\\mathrm{Tr}^{\\sigma}(\\varrho^{\\sigma}\\Pi^{\\sigma}) = 1\\). This implies that\nif one measured the property represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\), one\nwould obtain a positive outcome with probability 1. But it may be the\ncase that the projector \\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\) is not a composite of\natomic properties and, therefore, according to the AMI, it is not a\nproperty possessed by the composite quantum system\n\\(S^{\\sigma}\\).  \nTwo answers to this conceptual difficulty have been proposed. The\nfirst allows the existence of dispositional properties in addition to\nordinary properties (Clifton 1996). According to the second answer,\nthe projector \\(\\Pi^{\\sigma}\\) of the composite system\n\\(S^{\\sigma}\\) shows that \\(S^{\\sigma}\\) has a\ncollective dynamical effect onto the measurement device, that is, an\neffect that cannot be explained by the action of the atomic components\n(Dieks 1998). In other words, the composite quantum system, when\ninteracting with its environment, can behave as a collective entity,\nscreening off the contribution of the atomic quantum systems. This\nmeans that sometimes a non-atomic quantum system\n\\(S^{\\sigma}\\) may be taken as if it were an atomic\nquantum system within the framework of a coarse-grained\ndescription. \nIn the biorthogonal-decomposition interpretation (BDMI, sometimes\nknown as “Kochen-Dieks modal interpretation”, Kochen 1985;\nDieks 1988, 1989a,b, 1994a,b), the definite-valued observables are\npicked out by the biorthogonal (Schmidt) decomposition of the pure\nquantum state of the system: \n\nBiorthogonal Decomposition Theorem:\nGiven a vector \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) in a tensor-product Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}^1\n\\otimes \\mathcal{H}^2\\), there exist bases \\(\\{\\ket{a_i}\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\ket{p_i}\\}\\)\nfor \\(\\mathcal{H}^1\\) and \\(\\mathcal{H}^2\\) respectively, such that \\(\\ket{\\psi}\\) can be\nwritten as a linear combination of terms of the form \\(\\ket{a_i}\n\\otimes \\ket{p_i}\\). If the absolute values (modulus) of the\ncoefficients in this linear combination are all unequal, then the\nbases are unique (see, for example, Schrödinger 1935 for a\nproof).\n \nIn quantum mechanics the theorem means that, given a composite system\nconsisting of two subsystems, its state picks out (in many cases,\nuniquely) a basis for each of the subsystems. According to the BDMI,\nthose bases generate the definite-valued properties (the value states)\nof the corresponding subsystems. \nThe BDMI is particularly appropriate to account for quantum\nmeasurement. Let us consider an ideal measurement under the standard\nvon Neumann model, according to which a quantum measurement is an\ninteraction between a system \\(S\\) and a measuring apparatus\n\\(M\\). Before the interaction, \\(M\\) is prepared in a\nready-to-measure state \\(\\ket{p_0}\\), eigenvector of\nthe pointer observable \\(P\\) of \\(M\\), and the state of\n\\(S\\) is a superposition of the eigenstates\n\\(\\ket{a_i}\\) of an observable \\(A\\) of\n\\(S\\). The interaction introduces a correlation between the\neigenstates \\(\\ket{a_i}\\) of \\(A\\) and the\neigenstates \\(\\ket{p_i}\\) of \\(P\\):  \nIn this case, according to the BDMI prescription, the preferred\ncontext of the measured system \\(S\\) is defined by the set\n\\(\\{\\ket{a_i}\\}\\) and the preferred context of the measuring apparatus\n\\(M\\) is defined by the set \\(\\{\\ket{p_i}\\}\\). Therefore, the pointer\nposition is a definite-valued property of the apparatus: it acquires\none of its possible values (eigenvalues) \\(p_i\\). And analogously in\nthe measured system: the measured observable is a definite-valued\nproperty of the measured system, and it acquires one of its possible\nvalues (eigenvalues) \\(a_i\\).  \nIn spite of the fact that this modal interpretation is characterized\nby the central role played by biorthogonal decomposition, two\ndifferent versions can be distinguished. One of them adopts a\nmetaphysics in which all properties are relational and, as a\nconsequence, the fact that the application of the interpretation is\nrestricted to subsystems of a two-component compound system is not a\nproblem (Kochen 1985). This relation has been called\n“witnessing”: properties are not possessed by the system\nabsolutely, but only when it is “witnessed” by another\nsystem. Consider the measurement described above: the pointer\n“witnesses” the value acquired by the measured observable\nof the measured system. \nBy contrast, according to the other version (Dieks 1988, 1989a,b) the\nproperties ascribed to the system do not have a relational character.\nThis proposal therefore faces consistency questions about the\nassignments of definite values to observables according to different\nways of splitting up the total system into components. Consider, for\nexample, the three-component composite system \\(\\alpha \\beta \\chi\\). We\ncould apply the biorthogonal decomposition theorem to the\ntwo-component system (i) \\(\\alpha(\\beta \\chi)\\), or (ii)\n\\(\\beta(\\chi \\alpha)\\) or (iii) \\(\\chi(\\alpha \\beta)\\). Suppose that, as a\nresult of this, in case (i) the system \\(\\alpha\\) has the definite-valued\nproperty \\(P\\), in case (ii) the system \\(\\beta\\) has the\ndefinite-valued property \\(Q\\), and in case (iii) the system\n\\(\\alpha \\beta\\) has the definite-valued property \\(R\\). How do the\ndefinite-valued properties of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) relate to those of\n\\(\\alpha \\beta\\)? Are the definite-values properties of system\n\\(\\alpha \\beta\\) \\(P \\amp Q\\), or \\(R\\), or both? \nThis problem has been addressed by different authors during the 1990s\n(see Vermaas 1999; Bacciagaluppi 1996). This work led to the\nspectral-decomposition modal interpretation (SDMI, sometimes known as\n“Vermaas-Dieks modal interpretation”, Vermaas and Dieks\n1995) a generalization of the BDMI interpretation to mixed states. The\nSDMI is based on the spectral decomposition of the reduced density\noperator: the definite-valued properties \\(\\Pi_i\\) of a system and\ntheir corresponding probabilities \\(\\mathrm{Pr}_i\\) are given by the non-zero\ndiagonal elements of the spectral decomposition of the system’s\nstate, \nThis new proposal matches the old one in cases where the old one\napplies, and generalizes it by fixing the definite-valued properties\nin terms of multi-dimensional projectors when the biorthogonal\ndecomposition is degenerate: definite-valued properties need not\nalways be represented by one-dimensional\nvectors—higher-dimensional subspaces of the Hilbert space can\nalso occur. \nThe SDMI also has a direct application to the measurement situation.\nConsider quantum measurement as described above, where the reduced\nstates of the measured system \\(S\\) and the measuring apparatus\n\\(M\\) are \nAccording to the SDMI, the preferred context of \\(S\\) is defined by\nthe projectors \\(\\Pi_i^a\\) and the preferred context of \\(M\\) is\ndefined by projectors \\(\\Pi_i^p\\).  Therefore, also in the SDMI, the\nobservables \\(A\\) of \\(S\\) and \\(P\\) of \\(M\\) acquire actual definite\nvalues, whose probabilities are given by the diagonal elements of the\ndiagonalized reduced states. \nThe SDMI faces the same difficulty as the non-relational version of\nthe BDMI: the fact that a system can be decomposed in a variety of\ndifferent ways. In particular, the factorization of a given Hilbert\nspace \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) into two factors, \\(\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{H}^1 \\otimes \\mathcal{H}^2\\), can be\n“rotated” to produce different factorizations \\(\\mathcal{H}' =\n\\mathcal{H}^1{}^\\prime \\otimes \\mathcal{H}^2{}^\\prime\\). Are we to apply the SDMI to each\nsuch factorization? How are the results related, if at all? A theorem\ndue to Bacciagaluppi (1995, see also Vermaas 1997) shows, in essence,\nthat if one applies the SDMI to the “subsystems” obtained\nin every factorization and insists that the definite-valued properties\nso-obtained are not relational, then one will be led to a mathematical\ncontradiction of the Kochen-Specker variety. In response, one could\nadopt the view that subsystems have their definite-valued properties\n“relative to a factorization”; we will come back to this\nissue below. \nHealey (1989) was also among the first to make use of the biorthogonal\ndecomposition theorem, developing these ideas in a somewhat different\ndirection. His main concern was the apparent non-locality of quantum\nmechanics. Healey’s intuition about the way a modal\ninterpretation based on the biorthogonal decomposition theorem would\nbe applied to, say, an EPR experiment is to implement the idea that an\nEPR pair possesses a “holistic” property; this can then\nexplain why the apparatus on one side of the experiment acquires a\nproperty that is correlated to the result on the other side. \nIn Healey’s proposal, the biorthogonal decomposition theorem is\nused, but the set of possible properties is subsequently modified in\norder to fulfill a variety of desiderata. The first is consistency:\nthe aim is to avoid Kochen-Specker-type results. A second is to\nmaintain a plausible theory of the relationship between composite\nsystems and their subsystems. A third is to maintain a plausible\naccount of the relations among definite-valued properties at a given\ntime. A fourth is to maintain a plausible account of the relations\namong definite-valued properties at different times. The structure of\ndefinite-valued properties that emerges from these conditions is\nextremely complicated. Some progress has been made since\nHealey’s book was published (see for example Reeder and Clifton\n1995) but, in general, it remains difficult to see what the set of\ndefinite-valued properties is according to his approach. \nAbove we suggested that the BDMI and the SDMI solve the measurement\nproblem in a particularly direct way. This is right in the case of the\nideal von Neumann measurement, as explained in the previous section,\nwhere the eigenstates \\(\\ket{a_i}\\) of an observable\n\\(A\\) of the measured system \\(S\\) are perfectly correlated\nwith the eigenstates \\(\\ket{p_i}\\) of the pointer\n\\(P\\) of the measuring apparatus \\(M\\). However, ideal\nmeasurement is a situation that can never be achieved in practice: the\ninteraction between \\(S\\) and \\(M\\) never introduces a\ncompletely perfect correlation. Two kinds of non-ideal measurements\nare usually distinguished in the literature: \nNote, however, that disturbing measurement can be rewritten as\nimperfect measurements (and vice versa). \nImperfect measurements pose a challenge to the BDMI and the SDMI,\nsince their rules for selecting the definite-valued properties do not\npick out the right properties for the apparatus in the imperfect case\n(see Albert and Loewer 1990, 1991, 1993; also Ruetsche 1995). An\nexample that clearly brings out the difficulties introduced by\nnon-ideal measurements was formulated in the context of Stern-Gerlach\nexperiments (Elby 1993). This argument uses the fact that the\nwavefunctions in the \\(z\\)-variable typically have infinite\n“tails” that introduce non-zero cross-terms; therefore,\nthe “tail” of the wavefunction of the “down”\nbeam may produce detection in the upper detector, and vice versa (see\nDickson 1994 for a detailed discussion). \nIn fact, if the biorthogonal decomposition is applied to the\nnon-perfectly correlated state \\(\\sum_{ij} d_{ij} \\ket{a_i} \\otimes\n\\ket{p_j} = \\sum_i c_i' \\ket{a_i'} \\otimes \\ket{p_i'}\\), according to\nthe BDMI the result does not select the pointer \\(P\\) as a\ndefinite-valued property, but a different observable \\(P'\\) with\neigenstates \\(\\ket{p_i'}\\). In this case, in which the definite-valued\nproperties selected by a modal interpretation are different from those\nexpected, the question arises how different they are. In the case of\nan imperfect measurement, it may be assumed that the \\(d_{ij} \\ne 0\\),\nwith \\(i \\ne j\\), be small; then, the difference might be also\nsmall. But in the case of a disturbing measurement, the \\(d_{ij} \\ne\n0\\), with \\(i \\ne j\\), need not be small and, as a consequence, the\ndisagreement between the modal interpretation assignment and the\nexperimental result might be unacceptable (see a full discussion in\nBacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1996).  This fact has been considered as a\n“silver bullet” for killing the modal interpretations\n(Harvey Brown, cited in Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1996). \nThere is another important problem related to non-ideal measurements.\nWhen the final state of the composite system (measured system plus\nmeasuring device) is very nearly degenerate when written in the basis\ngiven by the measured observable and the apparatus’s pointer\n(that is, when the probabilities for the various results are nearly\nequal), the spectral decomposition does not, in general, select as\ndefinite-valued properties close to those ideally expected. In fact,\nthe observables so selected may be incompatible (non-commuting) with\nthe observables that we expect on the basis of observation\n(Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo 1994, 1996). \nIn order to face the problems that non-ideal measurements pose to the\nBDMI and the SDMI, several authors have appealed to the phenomenon of\ndecoherence; this will be discussed below. \nLet us take a composite system \\(\\alpha \\beta\\), whose component\nsubsystems \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are represented by the Hilbert\nspaces \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\beta}\\), respectively, and consider a\nproperty represented by the projector \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) defined on\n\\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\alpha}\\). It is usual to assume that \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) represents\nthe same property as that represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes\nI^{\\beta}\\) defined on \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\alpha} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}^{\\beta}\\), where\n\\(I^{\\beta}\\) is the identity operator on \\(\\mathcal{H}^{\\beta}\\). This\nassumption is based on the observational indistinguishability of the\nmagnitudes represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes\nI^{\\beta}\\): if the \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\)-measurement has a certain\noutcome, then the \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\)-measurement has\nexactly the same outcome. \nThe question is then: If the rules of the BDMI and the SDMI applied to\n\\(\\alpha\\) assign a value to \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\), do those rules applied\nto the composite system \\(\\alpha \\beta\\) assign the same value to\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) (condition known as Property\nComposition), and vice versa (Property Decomposition)? The answer to\nthis question is negative: the BDMI and the SDMI violate Property\nComposition and Property Decomposition (for a proof, see Vermaas\n1998). \nOf course, if one maintains that the projectors \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) and\n\\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) represent the same property, the\nviolation of Property Composition and Property Decomposition is a\nserious problem for any interpretation. This is the position adopted\nby Arntzenius (1990), who judges this violation to be bizarre, since\nit assigns different truth values to propositions like ‘the\nleft-hand side of a table is green’ and ‘the table has a\ngreen left-hand side’, which are normally not distinguished; a\nsimilar argument is put forward by Clifton (1996, see also Clifton\n1995c). \nHowever, Vermaas (1998) argues that the observational\nindistinguishability of the magnitudes represented by \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\)\nand \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) does not force one to consider\nthese two projectors as representing the same property: in fact, they\nare distinguishable from a theoretical viewpoint, since they are\ndefined on different Hilbert spaces. Moreover, he argues that the\nexamples developed by Arntzenius and Clifton sound bizarre precisely\nin the light of Property Composition and Property Decomposition. But\nin the quantum realm we must accept that the questions of which\nproperties are possessed by a system and which by its subsystems are\ndifferent questions: the properties of a composite system \\(\\alpha\n\\beta\\) don’t reveal information about the properties of\nsubsystem \\(\\alpha\\), and vice versa. Vermaas concludes that the tenet\nthat \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha}\\) and \\(\\Pi^{\\alpha} \\otimes I^{\\beta}\\) do\nrepresent the same property can be viewed as an addition to quantum\nmechanics, which can be denied as, for instance, van Fraassen (1991)\ndid. \nAs we have seen, modal interpretations intend to provide, for every\ninstant, a set of definite-valued properties and their probabilities.\nSome advocates of modal interpretations may be willing to leave the\nmatter, more or less, at that. Others take it to be crucial for any\nmodal interpretation that it also answers questions of the form: Given\nthat the property \\(P\\) of a system has the actual value \\(\\alpha\\) at\ntime \\(t_0\\), what is the probability that its property \\(P'\\) has the\nactual value \\(\\beta\\) at time \\(t_1 \\gt t_0\\)? In other words, they\nwant a dynamics of actual properties. \nThere are arguments on both sides. Those who argue for the necessity\nof such a dynamics maintain that we have to assure that the\ntrajectories of actual properties really are, at\nleast for macroscopic objects, like we see them to be, i.e., like the\nrecords contained in memories. For example, we should require not only\nthat the book at rest on the desk possess a definite location, but\nalso that, if undisturbed, its location relative to the desk does not\nchange in time. Accordingly, one cannot get away with simply\nspecifying the definite properties at each instant of time. We need\nalso to show that this specification is at least compatible with a\nreasonable dynamics; better still, specify this dynamics\nexplicitly. \nThose who consider a dynamics of actual properties to be superfluous\nreply that such a dynamics is more than what an interpretation of\nquantum mechanics needs to provide. Memory contents for each instant\nare enough to make empirical adequacy possible. \nAs pointed out by Ruetsche (2003), in this debate about the need for a\ndynamics of actual properties it is important whether the modal\ninterpretation is viewed as leading to a hidden-variables\ntheory, in which value states are added as hidden variables to\nthe original formalism in order to obtain a full description of the\nphysical situation, or rather as only equipping the original formalism\nwith a new semantics. In the first approach one would expect a full\ndynamics of actual properties, in the second this is not so clear. \nOf course, modal interpretations do admit a trivial dynamics, namely,\none in which there is no correlation from one time to the next. In\nthis case, the probability of a transition from the property \\(P\\)\nhaving the actual value \\(\\alpha\\) at \\(t_0\\), to the property \\(P'\\)\nhaving the actual value \\(\\beta\\) at \\(t_1 \\gt t_0\\) is just the\nsingle-time probability for \\(P'\\) having \\(\\beta\\) at\n\\(t_1\\). However, this dynamics is unlikely to interest those who feel\nthe need for a dynamics at all. Several researchers have contributed\nto the project of constructing a more interesting form of dynamics for\nmodal interpretations (see Vermaas 1996, 1998).  An important account\nis due to Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999, see also Bacciagaluppi\n1998). That work shows the most significant challenges that the\nconstruction of a dynamics of actual properties must face. \nThe first challenge is posed by the fact that the set of\ndefinite-valued properties—let us call it\n‘\\(S\\)’—may change over time. One therefore has to\ndefine a family of maps, each one being a 1–1 map from \\(S_0\\)\nat time \\(t_0\\) to a different \\(S_t\\) at time \\(t\\), for any\ntime. With such a family of maps, one can effectively define\nconditional probabilities within a single state space, and then\ntranslate them into “transition” probabilities. For this\ntechnique to work, \\(S_t\\) must have the same cardinality at any time.\nHowever, in general this is not the case: for instance, in the SDMI,\nthe number of different projectors appearing in the spectral\ndecomposition of the density matrix may vary with time. \nA way out of this is to augment \\(S\\) at each time so that its\ncardinality matches the highest cardinality that \\(S\\) ever\nachieves. Of course, one hopes to do so in a way that is not\ncompletely ad hoc. For example, in the context of the SDMI,\nBacciagaluppi, Donald and Vermaas (1995) show that the\n“trajectory” through Hilbert space of the spectral\ncomponents of the reduced state of a physical system will, under\nreasonable conditions, be continuous, or have only isolated\ndiscontinuities, so that the trajectory can be naturally extended to a\ncontinuous trajectory (see also Donald 1998). This result suggests a\nnatural family of maps as discussed above: map each spectral component\nat one time to its unique continuous evolved component at later\ntimes. \nThe second challenge to the construction of a dynamics arises from the\nfact that one wants to define transition probabilities over\ninfinitesimal units of time, and then derive the finite-time\ntransition probabilities from them. Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999)\nargue that, adapting results from the theory of stochastic processes,\none can show that the procedure may, more or less, be carried out for\nmodal interpretations of at least some varieties. \nFinally, one must actually define infinitesimal transition\nprobabilities that will give rise to the proper quantum-mechanical\nprobabilities at each time. Following earlier papers by Bell (1984),\nVink (1993) and others, Bacciagaluppi and Dickson (1999) define an\ninfinite class of such infinitesimal transition probabilities, such\nthat all of them generate the correct single-time probabilities, which\narguably are all we can really test. However, Sudbery (2002) has\ncontended that the form of the transition probabilities would be\nrelevant to the precise form of spontaneous decay or the\n“Dehmelt quantum jumps”; he independently developed the\ndynamics of Bacciagaluppi and Dickson and applied it in such a way\nthat it leads to the correct predictions for these experiments.\nGambetta and Wiseman (2003, 2004) developed a dynamical modal account\nin the form of a non-Markovian process with noise, also extending\ntheir approach to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). More\nrecently, Hollowood (2013a, 2013b, 2014) has elaborated the idea that\nthe dynamics of value states can be modeled by a discrete-time Markov\nchain. \nAs we have seen, both the SDMI and the non-relational version of the\nBDMI have to face the problem of the multiple factorizability of a\ngiven Hilbert space: if the definite-valued properties are monadic\n(i.e., non-relational), both interpretations led to a\nKochen-Specker-type contradiction (Bacciagaluppi 1995). This points to\nthe direction of an interpretation that makes properties relational,\nin this case relative to a factorization. \nExtending this idea, a perspectival modal interpretation (PMI, Bene\nand Dieks 2002) was developed, in which the properties of a physical\nsystem have a relational character and are defined with respect to\nanother physical system that serves as a “reference\nsystem” (see Bene 1997). This interpretation is similar in\nspirit to the idea that systems have properties as\n“witnessed” by the rest of the universe (Kochen 1985).\nHowever, the PMI goes further by defining states of a system not only\nwith respect to the universe, but also with respect to arbitrary\nlarger systems. The PMI is closely related to the SDMI since similar\nrules are used to assign properties to quantum systems. \nIn the PMI, the state of any system \\(S\\) needs the specification of a\n“reference system” \\(R\\) with respect to which the state\nis defined: this state of \\(S\\) with respect to \\(R\\) is denoted by\n\\(\\varrho_{R}^{S}\\). In the special case in which \\(R\\) coincides with\n\\(S\\), the state \\(\\varrho_{S}^{S}\\) is called “the state of\nS with respect to itself”. If the system \\(S\\) is contained\nin a system \\(A\\), the state \\(\\varrho_{A}^{S}\\) is defined as the\ndensity operator that can be derived from \\(\\varrho_{A}^{A}\\) by\ntaking the partial trace over the degrees of freedom in \\(A\\) that do\nnot pertain to \\(S\\): \nWith these definitions, the point of departure of the PMI is the\nquantum state of the whole universe with respect to itself, which it\nis assumed to be a pure state \\(\\varrho_{U}^{U} = \\ket{\\psi}\n\\bra{\\psi}\\) which evolves unitarily according to the Schrödinger\nequation. For any system \\(S\\) contained in the universe, its state\nwith respect to itself \\(\\varrho_{S}^{S}\\) is postulated to be one of\nthe projectors of the spectral resolution of \nIn particular, if there is no degeneracy among the eigenvalues of\n\\(\\varrho_{U}^{S}\\), these projectors are one-dimensional and\n\\(\\varrho_{S}^{S}\\) is the one-dimensional projector\n\\(\\ket{\\psi_{S}} \\bra{\\psi_{S}}\\). \nWithin this PMI conceptual framework it can be shown that a system may\nbe localized from the perspective of one observer and, nevertheless,\nmay be delocalized from a different perspective. But it also follows\nthat observers who look at the same macroscopic object, at the same\ntime and under identical circumstances, will see it (practically) at\nthe same spot. \nThe core idea of this interpretation is that all different relational\ndescriptions, given from different perspectives, are equally objective\nand all correspond to physical reality (which has a relational\ncharacter itself). We cannot explain the relational states by\nappealing to a definition in terms of more basic non-relational\nstates. Further analysis shows that in this interpretation EPR-type\nsituations can be understood in a basically local manner. Indeed, the\nchange in the relational state of particle 2 with respect to the\n2-particle system can be understood as a consequence of the change in\nthe reference system brought about by the local measurement\ninteraction between particle 1 and the measuring device. This local\nmeasurement is responsible for the creation of a new perspective, and\nfrom this new perspective there is a new relational state of particle\n2 (see also Dieks 2009). \nThe PMI agrees with Bohr’s qualitative argument that any\nreasonable definition of physical reality in the quantum realm should\ninclude the experimental setup. However, the PMI is more general in\nthe sense that the state of a system is defined with respect to any\nlarger physical system, not necessarily an instrument. This removes\nthe threat of subjectivism, since the relational states follow\nunambiguously from the quantum formalism and the physics of the\nsituation. \nIt is interesting to consider the connections between the PMI and\nother relational proposals. For instance, Berkovitz and Hemmo (2006)\npropose the prospects of a relational modal interpretation in the\nrelativistic case (we will come back to this point below). In turn,\nRovelli and coworkers propose an explicit ‘relational quantum\nmechanics’ that emphasizes the possibility of different\ndescriptions of a physical system depending on the perspective\n(Rovelli 1996; Rovelli and Smerlak 2007; Laudisa and Rovelli 2008; see\nalso van Fraassen 2010 and the entry on\n relational quantum mechanics).\n In spite of the points of contact between the PMI and Rovelli’s\nrelational interpretation, there are significant differences. In\nRovelli’s proposal, the concepts of measurement interaction and\nof definite outcomes of measurements are primary; moreover, the state\nhas to be updated every time that a measurement event occurs and, as a\nconsequence, it changes discontinuously with every new event. On the\ncontrary, the PMI is a realist interpretation where a measurement is\nnothing else than a quantum interaction, and where unitary evolution\nis the main dynamical principle, also when systems interact (see Dieks\n2009). \nAs Bub (1997) points out, in most modal interpretations the preferred\ncontext of definite-valued observables depends on the state of the\nsystem. An exception is Bohmian mechanics, in which the preferred\ncontext is a priori defined by the position observable; in this case,\nproperty composition and property decomposition hold. But this is not\nthe only reasonable possibility for a modal interpretation with a\nfixed preferred observable. In fact, the modal-Hamiltonian\ninterpretation (MHI, Lombardi and Castagnino 2008; Ardenghi,\nCastagnino, and Lombardi 2009; Lombardi, Castagnino, and Ardenghi\n2010; Ardenghi and Lombardi 2011) endows the Hamiltonian of a system\nwith a determining role, both in the definition of systems and\nsubsystems and in the selection of the preferred context. \nThe MHI is based on the following postulates: \nSystems postulate (SP):\nA quantum system \\(S\\) is represented by a pair \\((\\mathcal{O}, H)\\)\nsuch that (i) \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) is a space of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert\nspace, representing the observables of the system, (ii) \\(H \\in \\mathcal{O}\\) is\nthe time-independent Hamiltonian of the system \\(S\\), and (iii) if\n\\(\\varrho_0 \\in \\mathcal{O}'\\) (where \\(\\mathcal{O}'\\) is the dual space of \\(\\mathcal{O})\\) is the\ninitial state of \\(S\\), it evolves according to the Schrödinger\nequation. \nAlthough any quantum system can be decomposed in parts in many ways,\naccording to the MHI a decomposition leads to parts which are also\nquantum systems only when the components’ behaviors are dynamically\nindependent of each other, that is, when there is no interaction among\nthe subsystems: \nComposite systems postulate (CSP):\nA quantum system represented by \\(S: (\\mathcal{O}, H)\\), with initial state\n\\(\\varrho_0 \\in \\mathcal{O}'\\), is composite when it can be partitioned\ninto two quantum systems \\(S^1 : (\\mathcal{O}^1, H^1)\\) and \\(S^2 : (\\mathcal{O}^2, H^2)\\)\nsuch that (i) \\(\\mathcal{O} = \\mathcal{O}^1 \\otimes \\mathcal{O}^2\\), and (ii) \\(H = H^1 \\otimes I^2 + I^1 \\otimes H^2\\) (where \\(I^1\\) and \\(I^2\\) are the identity\noperators in the corresponding tensor product spaces). In this case,\nwe say that \\(S^1\\) and \\(S^2\\) are subsystems of the\ncomposite system \\(S = S^1 \\cup S^2\\). If the system is not composite,\nit is elemental.\n \nWith respect to the preferred context, the basic idea of the MHI is\nthat the Hamiltonian of the system defines actualization. Any\nobservable that does not have the symmetries of the Hamiltonian cannot\nacquire a definite actual value, since this actualization would break\nthe symmetry of the system in an arbitrary way. \nActualization rule (AR): \nGiven an elemental quantum system represented by \\(S: (\\mathcal{O}, H)\\), the\nactual-valued observables of \\(S\\) are \\(H\\) and all the observables\ncommuting with \\(H\\) and having, at least, the same symmetries as\n\\(H\\). \nThe selection of the preferred context exclusively on the basis of a\npreferred observable has been criticized by arguing that in the\nHilbert space formalism all observables are on an equal footing.\nHowever, quantum mechanics is not just Hilbert space mathematics: it\nis a physical theory that includes a dynamical law in which the\nHamiltonian is singled out to play a central role. \nThe justification for selecting the Hamiltonian as the preferred\nobservable ultimately lies in the success of the MHI and its ability\nto solve interpretive difficulties. With respect to the first point:\nthe scheme has been applied to several well-known physical situations\n(free particle with spin, harmonic oscillator, free hydrogen atom,\nZeeman effect, fine structure, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation),\nleading to results consistent with empirical evidence (Lombardi and\nCastagnino 2008, Section 5). With respect to interpretation, the MHI\nconfronts quantum contextuality by selecting a preferred context, and\nhas proved to be able to supply an account of the measurement problem,\nboth in its ideal and its non-ideal versions; moreover, in the\nnon-ideal case it gives a criterion to distinguish between reliable\nand non-reliable measurements (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008, Section\n6), a criterion that can be generalized when expressed in\ninformational terms (Lombardi, Fortin and López 2015). \nIn the MHI property composition and property decomposition hold\nbecause the actualization rule only applies to elemental\nsystems: the definite-valued properties of composite systems are\nselected on the basis of those of the elemental components, and\nfollowing the usual quantum assumption according to which the\nobservable \\(A^1\\) of a subsystem \\(S^1\\) and the observable \\(A = A^1\n\\otimes I^2\\) of the composite system \\(S = S^1 \\cup S^2\\) represent\nthe same property (Ardenghi and Lombardi 2011). \nThe preferred context of the MHI does not change with time: the\ndefinite-valued observables always commute with the Hamiltonian and,\ntherefore, they are constants of motion of the system. This means that\nthey are the same during the whole “life” of the quantum\nsystem as a closed system, since its initial “birth”, when\nit arises as a result of an interaction, up to its final\n“death”, when it disappears by interacting with another\nsystem. As a consequence, there is no need of accounting for the\ndynamics of the actual properties as in the BDMI and the SDMI. \nIn more recent years, the MHI has extended its applications to further\nsituations, such as the non-collapse account of consecutive\nmeasurements in physics (Ardenghi, Lombardi and Narvaja 2013) and the\nproblem of optical isomerism in chemistry (Fortin, Lombardi and\nMartínez González 2016a, 2016b). Moreover, on the basis\nof its closed-system perspective, the MHI opens the way toward a\ntop-down view of quantum mechanics, according to which reduced states\nare coarse-grained states of a closed system (Fortin and Lombardi\n2014) and decoherence is a phenomenon relative to the particular\npartition of the closed system considered in each case (Lombardi,\nFortin and Castagnino 2012, Fortin and Lombardi 2016). \nOne of the leading ideas of the modal interpretations is\nprobabilism: quantum mechanics does not correspond in a\none-to-one way to actual reality, but rather provides us with a list\nof possibilities and their probabilities. Therefore, the notions of\npossibility and probability are central in this interpretive\nframework. This raises two issues: the formal treatment of\nprobabilities, and the interpretation of probability. \nSince the set of events corresponding to all projector operators on a\ngiven Hilbert space does not have a Boolean structure, the Born\nprobability (which is defined over these projectors) does not satisfy\nthe definition of probability of Kolmogorov (which applies to a\nBoolean algebra of events). For this reason, some authors define a\ngeneralized non-Kolmogorovian probability function over the\northo-algebra of quantum events (Hughes 1989; Cohen 1989). Modal\ninterpretations do not follow this path: they conceive probabilities\nas represented by a Kolmogorovian measure on the Boolean algebra\nrepresenting the definite-valued quantities, generated by mutually\ncommuting projectors. The various modal interpretations differ from\neach other in their definitions of the preferred context on which the\nKolmogorovian probability is defined. \nAs we have seen, the definite-valued properties of a system are\nusually characterized in terms of the quantum state \\(\\ket{\\phi}\\) and\na privileged observable \\(\\boldsymbol{R}\\) (Bub and Clifton 1996; Bub,\nClifton, and Goldstein 2000; Dieks 2005). Dieks (2007) derives a\nuniqueness result, namely that given the splitting of a total Hilbert\nspace into two factors spaces, representing the system and its\nenvironment, respectively, the Boolean lattice of definite-valued\nobservables is fixed by the state of the system alone.  Furthermore,\nit follows that the Born measure is the only one that is definable\nfrom just the product structure of Hilbert space, the state in the\nHilbert space, and the definite-valued observables selected by the\nstate. \nThe MHI defines a context as a complete set of orthogonal projectors\n\\(\\{\\Pi_{\\alpha}\\}\\), such that \\(\\sum_{i} \\Pi_{i} = I\\) and\n\\(\\Pi_{i}\\Pi_j = \\delta_{ij}\\Pi_{i}\\), where\n\\(I\\) is the identity operator in \\(\\mathcal{H} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}\\).\nSince each context generates a Boolean structure, the state of the\nsystem defines a Kolmogorovian probability function on each individual\ncontext (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008). However, only the\nprobabilities defined on the context determined by the eigenprojectors\nof the Hamiltonian of an elemental closed system correspond to the\npossible values one of which becomes actual. \nIn modal interpretations the event space on which the (preferred)\nprobability measure is defined is a space of possible events,\namong which only one becomes actual. The fact that the actual event is\nnot singled out by these interpretations is what makes them\nfundamentally probabilistic. This aspect distinguishes modal\ninterpretations from many-worlds interpretations, where the\nprobability measure is defined on a space of events that are all\nactual. Nevertheless, this does not mean that all modal\ninterpretations agree about the interpretation of probability. \nIn the context of the BDMI, the SDMI and the PMI, it is usually\nclaimed that, given the space of possible events, the state generates\nan ignorance-interpretable probability measure over this set: quantum\nprobabilities quantify the ignorance of the observer about the actual\nvalues acquired by the system’s observables (see, e.g., Dieks\n1988; Clifton 1995a; Vermaas 1999; Bene and Dieks 2002). \nBy contrast to actualism—the conception that reduces possibility\nto actuality (see Dieks 2010, Bueno 2014)—some modal\ninterpretations, in particular the MHI, adopt a possibilist\nconception, according to which possible\nevents—possibilia—constitute a basic ontological\ncategory (see Menzel 2007). The probability measure is in this case\nseen as a representation of an ontological propensity of a possible\nquantum event to become actual (Lombardi and Castagnino 2008; see also\nSuárez 2004). \nThese views do not all exclude each other. If probabilities quantify\nignorance about the actual values of the observables, this need not\nmean that this ignorance can be removed by the addition of further\ninformation. If quantum probabilities are ontological propensities,\nour ignorance about the possible event that becomes actual is a\nnecessary consequence of the indeterministic nature of the system\nbecause there simply is no additional information specifying a more\naccurate state of the system. \nAccording to the environment-induced approach to decoherence (Zurek\n1981, 2003; see also Schlosshauer 2007), the measuring apparatus is an\nopen system in continuous interaction with its environment; as a\nconsequence of this interaction, the reduced state of the apparatus\nand the measured system becomes, almost instantaneously,\nindistinguishable from a state that would represent an ignorance\nmixture (“proper mixture”) over unknown values of the\napparatus’ pointer. The idea that decoherence might play a role in\nmodal interpretations was proposed by several authors early on (Dieks\n1989b; Healey 1995). But it has acquired a central relevance in\nrelation to the discussion of non-ideal measurements in the modal\ninterpretation. \nAs we have seen, in the BDMI and the SDMI, the biorthogonal or the\nspectral decomposition does not pick out the right properties for the\napparatus in non-ideal measurements. Bacciagaluppi and Hemmo (1996)\nshow that, when the apparatus is a finite-dimensional system in\ninteraction with an environment with a huge number of degrees of\nfreedom, decoherence guarantees that the spectral decomposition of the\napparatus’ reduced state will be very close to the ideally expected\nresult and, as a consequence, the apparatus’ pointer\nis—approximately—selected as an actual definite-valued\nobservable. Alternatively, Bub (1997) proposes that it is not\ndecoherence—with the “tracing out” of the\nenvironment and the diagonalization of the reduced state of the\napparatus—that is relevant for the definite value of the\npointer, but the triorthogonal or \\(n\\)-orthogonal decomposition\ntheorem, since it singles out a unique pointer basis for the\napparatus. \nIn either case, the interaction with the environment is a great help\nto the BDMI and the SDMI for handling non-ideal measurements with\nfinite-dimensional apparatuses. However, the case of\ninfinitely many distinct states for the apparatus is more\ntroublesome. Bacciagaluppi (2000) has analyzed this situation, using a\ncontinuous model of the apparatus’ interaction with the environment.\nHe concludes that in this case the spectral decomposition of the\nreduced state of the apparatus generally does not pick out states that\nare close enough to the ideally expected state. This result seems to\napply also to other cases where a macroscopic system (not described as\nfinite-dimensional) experiences decoherence due to interaction with\nits environment (see Donald 1998). However, model calculations in\nperspectival versions of the modal interpretation (Bene and Dieks\n2002; Hollowood 2013a, 2013b, 2014) indicate that the problem is less\nsevere in realistic circumstances than originally supposed. \nAs said above, in the case of the MHI decoherence is not explicitly\nappealed to in order to account for the definite reading of the\napparatus’ pointer (neither in ideal nor in non-ideal measurements).\nHowever, there still is a relation with the decoherence program. In\nfact, the measuring apparatus is always a macroscopic system with a\nhuge number of degrees of freedom, and the pointer must be a\n“collective” and empirically accessible observable; as a\nconsequence, the many degrees of freedom corresponding to the\ndegeneracies of the pointer play the role of a decohering\n“internal environment” (for details, see Lombardi 2010;\nLombardi et al. 2011). The role of decoherence in the MHI becomes\nclearer when the phenomenon of decoherence is understood from a\nclosed-system perspective (Castagnino, Laura, and Lombardi 2007;\nCastagnino, Fortin, and Lombardi 2010; Lombardi, Fortin, and\nCastagnino 2012). (See the entry on\n the role of decoherence in quantum mechanics.) \nThere are a number of open problems and perspectives in the modal\nprogram. Here we will consider some of them. \nModal interpretations are based on the standard formalism of quantum\nmechanics (in the Hilbert space version or in the algebraic version).\nHowever, Brown, Suárez and Bacciagaluppi (1998) argue that\nthere is more to quantum reality than what is described by\noperators and quantum states: they claim that gauges and coordinate\nsystems are important to our description of physical reality as well,\nwhile modal interpretations (AM, BDMI and SDMI) have standardly not\ntaken such things into consideration. In a similar vein, it has been\nargued that the Galilean space-time symmetries endow the formal\nskeleton of quantum mechanics with the physical flesh and blood that\nidentify the fundamental physical magnitudes and that allow the theory\nto be applied to concrete physical situations (Lombardi and Castagnino\n2008). The set of definite-valued observables of a system should be\nleft invariant by the Galilean transformations: it would be\nunacceptable that this set changed as a mere result of a change in the\nperspective from which the system is described. On the basis of this\nidea, the MHI rule of actualization has been reformulated in an\nexplicitly invariant form, in terms of the Casimir operators of the\nGalilean group (Ardenghi, Castagnino, and Lombardi 2009; Lombardi,\nCastagnino, and Ardenghi 2010). \nAnother fundamental question is the relativistic extension of the\nmodal approach. Dickson and Clifton (1998) have shown that a large\nclass of modal interpretations of ordinary quantum mechanics cannot be\nmade Lorentz-invariant in a straightforward way (see also Myrvold\n2002). With respect to the extension to algebraic quantum field theory\n(see Dieks 2002; Kitajima 2004), Clifton (2000) proposed a natural\ngeneralization of the non-relativistic modal scheme, but Earman and\nRuetsche (2005) showed that it is not yet clear whether it will be\nable to deal with measurement situations and whether it is empirically\nadequate. The problems revealed by these investigations are due to the\nnon-relativistic nature of the formalism of quantum mechanics that is\nemployed, in particular to the fact that the concept of a state of an\nextended system at one instant is central. In a local\nfield-theoretic context this becomes different, and this may avoid\nconflicts with relativity (Earman and Ruetsche 2005). Berkovitz and\nHemmo (2005) and Hemmo and Berkovitz (2005) propose a different way\nout: they argue that perspectivalism can come to the rescue here (see\nalso Berkovitz and Hemmo 2006). In turn, in the context of the MHI, it\nhas been argued that the actualization rule, expressed in terms of the\nCasimir operators of the Galilean group in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics, can be transferred to the relativistic domain by changing\nthe symmetry group accordingly: the definite-valued observables of a\nsystem would be those represented by the Casimir operators of the\nPoincaré group. Since the mass operator and the squared spin\noperator are the only Casimir operators of the Poincaré group,\nthey would always be definite-valued observables. This conclusion\nwould be in agreement with a usual assumption in quantum field theory:\nelemental particles always have definite values of mass and spin, and\nthose values are precisely what define the different kinds of\nelemental particles of the theory (Lombardi and Fortin 2015). \nThere are also specifically philosophical issues concerning\nontological matters: about the nature of the items referred to by\nquantum mechanics, that is, about the basic categories of the quantum\nontology. As we have seen, in general the properties of quantum\nsystems are considered to be monadic, with the exception of the\nrelational version of the BDMI and the PMI where these properties are\nrelational. In any case, it might be asked whether a quantum system\nhas to be conceived as an individual substratum supporting properties\nor as a mere “bundle” of properties. Following an original\nidea of Lombardi and Castagnino (2008), da Costa, Lombardi and Lastiri\n(2013) and da Costa and Lombardi (2014) have suggested that, in the\nmodal context, the bundle view might be appropriate to supply an\nanswer to the problem of indistinguishability (see also French and\nKrause 2006). Nevertheless, this quantum ontology of propertied does\nnot prevent the emergence of particles under certain particular\ncircumstances (see Lombardi and Dieks 2016). \nRecently, modal interpretations have begun to be considered by\npracticing physicists and mathematicians interested in foundational\nmatters. For instance, Hollowood (2014) offers an interpretation of\nquantum mechanics inspired by the perspectival modal interpretation:\nthe state of an open system describes its properties from the\nperspective of the closed system of which it is a sub-system. In turn,\nBarandes and Kagan (2014a, 2014b) propose a “minimal modal\ninterpretation”, inspired by the SDMI, according to which the\npreferred context is given by the evolving reduced state of the open\nsystem. Nakayama (2008a, 2008b) has explored connections between the\nmodal interpretation and the framework of topos theory. \nThese and similar developments have arisen in the context of detailed\ntechnical investigations. This illustrates one of the advantages of\nthe modal approach: it makes use of a precise set of rules that\ndetermine the set of definite-valued observables, and this makes it\npossible to derive rigorous results. It may well be that several of\nthese results, e.g., no-go theorems, can be applied to other\ninterpretations as well (e.g., to the many-worlds interpretation, see\nDieks 2007). Whatever the merit of the modal ideas in the end, one can\nat least say that they have given rise to a serious and fruitful\nseries of investigations into the nature of quantum theory.","contact.mail":"D.G.B.J.Dieks@phys.uu.nl","contact.domain":"phys.uu.nl"}]
