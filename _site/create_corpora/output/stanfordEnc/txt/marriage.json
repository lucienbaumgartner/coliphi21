Political philosophers have taken\nthe organization of sex and reproduction to be essential to the health\nof the state, and moral philosophers have debated whether marriage has\na special moral status and relation to the human good. Philosophers\nhave also disputed the underlying moral and legal rationales for the\nstructure of marriage, with implications for questions such as the\ncontent of its moral obligations and the legal recognition of same-sex\nmarriage. Feminist philosophers have seen marriage as playing a\ncrucial role in women's oppression and thus a central topic of\njustice.  In this area philosophy courts public debate: in 1940,\nBertrand Russell's appointment to an academic post was withdrawn on\nthe grounds that the liberal views expressed in Marriage and\nMorals made him morally unfit for such a post. Today, debate over\nsame-sex marriage is highly charged. Unlike some contemporary issues\nsparking such wide interest, there is a long tradition of\nphilosophical thought on marriage.\n\n\n\nPhilosophical debate concerning marriage extends to what marriage,\nfundamentally, is; therefore, Section 1 examines its definition.\nSection 2 sets out the historical development of the philosophy of\nmarriage, which shapes today's debates. Many of the ethical\npositions on marriage can be understood as divided on the question of\nwhether marriage should be defined contractually by the spouses or by\nits institutional purpose, and they further divide on whether that\npurpose necessarily includes procreation or may be limited to the\nmarital love relationship. Section 3 taxonomizes ethical views of\nmarriage accordingly. Section 4 will examine rival political\nunderstandings of marriage law and its rationale. Discussion of\nmarriage has played a central role in feminist philosophy; Section 5\nwill outline the foremost critiques of the institution.\n\n\n\n‘Marriage’ can refer to a legal contract and civil\nstatus, a religious rite, and a social practice, all of which vary by\nlegal jurisdiction, religious doctrine, and culture. History shows\nconsiderable variation in marital practices: polygyny has been widely\npracticed, some societies have approved of extra-marital sex and,\narguably, recognized same-sex marriages, and religious or civil\nofficiation has not always been the norm (Boswell 1994; Mohr 2005, 62;\nCoontz 2006). More fundamentally, while the contemporary Western ideal\nof marriage involves a relationship of love, friendship, or\ncompanionship, marriage historically functioned primarily as an\neconomic and political unit used to create kinship bonds, control\ninheritance, and share resources and labor. Indeed, some ancients and\nmedievals discouraged ‘excessive’ love in marriage. The\n‘love revolution’ in marriage dates popularly to the\n18th century (Coontz 2006, Part 3). \n\nEthical and political questions regarding marriage are sometimes\nanswered by appeal to the definition of marriage. But the historical\nand cultural variation in marital practices has prompted some\nphilosophers to argue that marriage is a ‘family\nresemblance’ concept, with no essential purpose or structure\n(Wasserstrom 1974). If marriage has no essential features, then one\ncannot appeal to definition to justify particular legal or moral\nobligations. For instance, if monogamy is not an essential feature of\nmarriage, then one cannot appeal to the definition of marriage to\njustify a requirement that legal marriage be monogamous. To a certain\nextent, the point that actual legal or social definitions cannot\nsettle the question of what features marriage should have is\njust. First, past applications of a term need not yield necessary and\nsufficient criteria for applying it: ‘marriage’ (like\n‘citizen’) may be extended to new cases without thereby\nchanging its meaning (Mercier 2001). Second, appeal to definition may\nbe uninformative: for example, legal definitions are sometimes\ncircular, defining marriage in terms of spouses and spouses in terms\nof marriage (Mohr 2005, 57).  Third, appeal to an existing definition\nin the context of debate over what the law of marriage, or its moral\nobligations, should be risks begging the question: in debate over\nsame-sex marriage, for example, appeal to the current legal definition\nbegs the normative question of what the law should be. However, this\npoint also tells against the argument for the family resemblance view\nof marriage, as the variation of marital forms in practice does not\npreclude the existence of a normatively ideal form. Thus, philosophers\nwho defend an essentialist definition of marriage offer normative\ndefinitions, which appeal to fundamental ethical or political\nprinciples. Defining marriage must depend on, rather than precede,\nethical and political inquiry. \n\nSetting the agenda for contemporary debate, ancient and medieval\nphilosophers raised recurring themes in the philosophy of marriage: the\nrelation between marriage and the state, the role of sex and\nprocreation in marriage, and the gendered nature of spousal roles.\nTheir works reflect evolving, and overlapping, ideas of marriage as an\neconomic or procreative unit, a religious sacrament, a contractual\nassociation, and a relationship of mutual support. \n\nIn his depiction of the ideal state, Plato (427–347 BCE) described a\nform of marriage contrasting greatly with actual marriage practices of\nhis time. He argued that, just as male and female watchdogs perform the\nsame duties, men and women should work together, and, among Guardians,\n‘wives and children [should be held] in common’ (The\nRepublic, ca. 375–370 BCE, 423e–424a). To orchestrate eugenic\nbreeding, temporary marriages would be made at festivals, where\nmatches, apparently chosen by lot, would be secretly arranged by the\nRulers. Resulting offspring would be taken from biological parents and\nreared anonymously in nurseries. Plato's reason for this radical\nrestructuring of marriage was to extend family sympathies from the\nnuclear family to the state itself: the abolition of the private family\nwas intended to discourage private interests at odds with the common\ngood and the strength of the state (ibid., 449a-466d; in\nPlato's Laws, ca. 355–47 BCE, private marriage is\nretained but still designed for public benefit). \n\nAristotle (384–322 BCE) sharply criticized this proposal as\nunworkable. On his view, Plato errs in assuming that the natural love\nfor one's own family can be transferred to all fellow-citizens.\nThe state arises from component parts, beginning with the natural\nprocreative union of male and female. It is thus a state of families\nrather than a family state, and its dependence on the functioning of\nindividual households makes marriage essential to political theory\n(Politics, 1264b). The Aristotelian idea that the stability of\nsociety depends on the marital family influenced Hegel, Rawls, and\nSandel, among others. Aristotle also disagreed with Plato on gender\nroles in marriage, and these views too would prove influential.\nMarriage, he argued, is properly structured by gender: the husband,\n“fitter for command,” rules. The sexes express their\nexcellences differently: “the courage of a man is shown in\ncommanding, of a woman in obeying,” a complementarity which\npromotes the marital good (Politics, ca. 330 BCE,\n1253b, 1259b, 1260a; Nicomachean Ethics, ca. 325 BCE,\n1160–62). \n\nIn contrast to the ancients, whose philosophical discussion of sex\nand sexual love was not confined to marriage, Christian philosophers\nintroduced a new focus on marriage as the sole permissible context for\nsex, marking a shift from viewing marriage as primarily a political and\neconomic unit. St. Augustine (354–430), following St. Paul, condemns\nsex outside marriage and lust within it. “[A]bstinence from all\nsexual union is better even than marital intercourse performed for the\nsake of procreating,” and the unmarried state is best of all\n(The Excellence of Marriage, ca. 401, §6, 13/15). But\nmarriage is justified by its goods: “children, fidelity [between\nspouses], and sacrament.” Although procreation is the purpose of\nmarriage, marriage does not morally rehabilitate lust. Instead, the\nreason for the individual marital sexual act determines its\npermissibility. Sex for the sake of procreation is not sinful, and sex\nwithin marriage solely to satisfy lust is a pardonable (venial) sin. As\nmarital sex is preferable to “fornication” (extra-marital\nsex), spouses owe the “marriage debt” (sex) to protect\nagainst temptation, thereby sustaining mutual fidelity (Marriage\nand Desire, Book I, ca. 418–19, §7, 8, 17/19, 14/16). \n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas (ca. 1225–1274) grounded concurring judgments\nabout sexual morality in natural law, explicating marriage in terms of\nbasic human goods, including procreation and fidelity between spouses\n(Finnis 1997). Monogamous marriage, as the arrangement fit for the\nrearing of children, “belong[s] to the natural law.”\nMonogamous marriage secures paternal guidance, which a child needs;\nfornication is thus a mortal sin because it “tends to injure the\nlife of the offspring.” (Aquinas rejects polygamy on similar\ngrounds while, like Augustine, arguing that it was once permitted to\npopulate the earth.) Marital sex employs the body for its purpose of\npreserving the species, and pleasure may be a divinely ordained part of\nthis. Even within marriage, sex is morally troubling because it\ninvolves “a loss of reason,” but this is compensated by the\ngoods of marriage (Summa Theologiae, unfinished at\nAquinas' death, II-II, 153, 2; 154, 2). Among these goods,\nAquinas emphasizes the mutual fidelity of the spouses, including\npayment of the “marriage debt” and “partnership of a\ncommon life”—a step towards ideas of companionate\nmarriage (Summa Theologiae, Supp. 49, 1). \n\nIndeed, we see indications of discontent with the economic model of\nmarriage a century earlier in the letters of Héloïse\n(ca. 1100–1163) to Abelard\n(1079–1142). Héloïse attacks marriage, understood as\nan economic transaction, arguing that a woman marrying for money or\nposition deserves “wages, not gratitude” and would\n“prostitute herself to a richer man, if she could.” In\nplace of this economic relation she praises love, understood on a\nCiceronian model of friendship: the “name of wife may seem more\nsacred or more binding, but sweeter for me will always be the word\nfriend (amica), or, if you will permit me, that of concubine\nor whore” (Abelard and Héloïse, Letters,\nca. 1133–1138, 51–2). The relation between love and\nmarriage will continue to preoccupy later philosophers. Do marital\nobligations and economic incentives threaten love, as\nHéloïse suggested? (Cave 2003, Card 1996) As Søren\nKierkegaard (1813–1855) dramatically suggests\nin The Seducer's Diary, are the obligations of\nmarriage incompatible with romantic and erotic love? Or, instead, does\nmarital commitment uniquely enable spousal love, as Aquinas suggested?\n(Finnis 1997; cf. Kierkegaard's Judge William's defense of marriage\n[Either/Or, 1843, vol.  2].) \n\nQuestions of the relation between love and marriage emerge from\nchanging understandings of the role of marriage; in the early modern era,\nfurther fault lines appear as new understandings of human society\nconflict with the traditional structure of marriage. For Aristotle,\nAugustine, and Aquinas, marriage was unproblematically structured by\nsexual difference, and its distinctive features explained by nature or\nsacrament. But in the early modern era, as doctrines of equal rights\nand contract appeared, a new ideal of relationships between adults as\nfree choices between equals appeared. In this light, the unequal and\nunchosen content of the marriage relationship raised philosophical\nproblems. Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) acknowledged that his arguments\nfor rough equality among humans apply to women: “whereas some\nhave attributed the dominion [over children] to the man only, as being\nof the more excellent sex; they misreckon in it. For there is not\nalways that difference of strength, or prudence between the man and\nthe woman, as that the right can be determined without war.”\nNonetheless, Hobbes admits that men dominate in marriage, which he\nexplains (inadequately) thus: “for the most part commonwealths\nhave been erected by the fathers, not by the mothers of\nfamilies” (Leviathan, 1651, Ch. 20; Okin 1979, 198–199,\nPateman 1988, 44–50). \n\nLikewise, defending marital hierarchy posed a problem for John Locke\n(1632–1704). Locke ties his rejection of political patriarchy to\na rejection of the patriarchal family, arguing that marriage, like the\nstate, rests on consent, not natural hierarchy; marriage is a\n“voluntary compact.” But Locke fails to follow this\nreasoning consistently, for Lockean marriage remains hierarchical: in\ncases of conflict, “the rule … naturally falls to the\nman's as the abler and stronger.” Ceding decision-making power\nto one party on the basis of a presumed natural hierarchy creates an\ninternal tension in Locke's views (The Second Treatise of\nGovernment, 1690, §77, 81, 82; Okin 1979,\n199–200). This inconsistency prompted Mary Astell's\n(1666–1731) response: “If all Men are born free,\nhow is it that all women are born slaves? as they must be if the being\nsubjected to the\ninconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary Will of Men, be the\nperfect Condition of Slavery?” (“Reflections upon\nMarriage,” 1700, 18) Similar tensions arise for Jean-Jacques\nRousseau (1712–1778), whose treatise on\neducation, Émile, describes the unequal status of\nÉmile's wife, Sophie. Her education, a template for all\nwomen's, prepares her only to please and serve her husband and rear\nchildren. Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1798) attacked Rousseau's views on\nwomen's nature, education, and marital inequality in A Vindication\nof the Rights of Woman (see also Okin 1979, Chapter 6). \n\nThe contractual understanding of marriage prompts the question as to\nwhy marital obligations should be fixed other than by spousal\nagreement. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) combined a contractual account of\nmarriage with an Augustinian preoccupation with sexual morality to\nargue that the distinctive content of the marriage contract was\nrequired to make sex permissible. In Kant's view, sex involves morally\nproblematic objectification, or treatment of oneself and other as a\nmere means. The marriage right, a “right to a person akin to a\nright to a thing,” gives spouses “lifelong possession of\neach other's sexual attributes,” a transaction supposed to\nrender sex compatible with respect for humanity: “while one\nperson is acquired by the other as if it were a thing, the\none who is acquired acquires the other in turn; for in this way each\nreclaims itself and restores its personality.” But while these\nrights, according to Kant, make sex compatible with justice, married\nsex is not clearly virtuous unless procreation is a possibility\n(Metaphysics of Morals, 1797–98, Ak 6:277–79, 6:424–427).\nKant's account of sexual objectification has had wide\ninfluence—from feminists to new natural lawyers. More\nsurprisingly, given his views on gender inequality and the wrongness\nof same-sex sexual activity, Kant's account of marriage has been\nsympathetically reconstructed by feminists and defenders of same-sex\nmarriage drawn by Kant's focus on equality, reciprocity, and the moral\nrehabilitation of sex within marriage (Herman 1993, Altman 2010,\nPapadaki 2010). Kant interestingly suggests that morally problematic\nrelationships can be reconstructed through equal juridical rights, but\nthe way in which such reconstruction occurs is puzzling (Herman 1993,\nBrake 2005).\n \n\nCharacteristically, G. W. F. Hegel's (1770–1831) account of\nmarriage synthesizes the preceding themes. Hegel returns to\nAristotle's understanding of (nuclear) marriage as the foundation\nof a healthy state, while explicating its contribution in terms of\nspousal love. Hegel criticized Kant's reduction of marriage to\ncontract as “disgraceful” because spouses begin “from\nthe point of view of contract—i.e. that of individual\npersonality as a self-sufficient unit—in order to supersede\nit.” They “consent to constitute a single\nperson and to give up their natural and individual personalities\nwithin this union.” The essence of marriage is ethical love,\n“the consciousness of this union as a substantial end, and hence\nin love, trust, and the sharing of the whole of individual\nexistence.” Ethical love is not, like sexual love, contingent:\n“Marriage should not be disrupted by passion, for the latter is\nsubordinate to it” (Elements of the Philosophy of Right,\n1821, §162–63, 163A). \n\nLike his predecessors, Hegel must justify the distinctive features\nof marriage, and in particular, why, if it is the ethical love\nrelationship which is ethically significant, formal marriage is\nnecessary. Hegel's contemporary Friedrich von Schlegel had argued\nthat love can exist outside marriage—a point which Hegel\ndenounced as the argument of a seducer! For Hegel, ethical love depends\non publicly assuming spousal roles which define individuals as members\nin a larger unit. Such unselfish membership links marriage and the\nstate. Marriage plays an important role in Hegel's system of\nright, which culminates in ethical life, the customs and institutions\nof society: family, civil society, and the state. The role of marriage\nis to prepare men to relate to other citizens as sharers in a common\nenterprise. In taking family relationships as conditions for good\ncitizenship, Hegel follows Aristotle and influences Rawls and Sandel;\nit is also notable that he takes marriage as a microcosm of the\nstate. \n\nKant and Hegel attempted to show that the distinctive features of\nmarriage could be explained and justified by guiding normative\nprinciples. In contrast, early feminists argued that marital hierarchy\nwas simply an unjust remnant of a pre-modern era. John Stuart Mill\n(1806–1873) argued that women's subordination within marriage\noriginated in physical force—an anomalous holdover of the\n‘law of the strongest’. Like Wollstonecraft in her\n1792 A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Mill compared\nmarriage and slavery: under coverture wives had no legal rights,\nlittle remedy for abuse, and, worse, were required to live in intimacy\nwith their ‘masters’. This example of an inequality based\non force had persisted so long, Mill argued, because all men had an\ninterest in retaining it. Mill challenged the contractual view that\nentry into marriage was fully voluntary for women, pointing out that\ntheir options were so limited that marriage was “only Hobson's\nchoice, ‘that or none’” (The Subjection of\nWomen, 1869, 29). He also challenged the view that women's nature\njustified marital inequality: in light of different socialization of\ngirls and boys, there was no way to tell what woman's nature really\nwas.  Like Wollstonecraft, Mill described the ideal marital\nrelationship as one of equal friendship (Abbey and Den Uyl,\n2001). Such marriages would be “schools of justice” for\nchildren, teaching them to treat others as equals.  But marital\ninequality was a school of injustice, teaching boys unearned privilege\nand corrupting future citizens. The comparison of marriage with\nslavery has been taken up by contemporary feminists (Cronan 1973), as\nhas the argument that marital injustice creates unjust citizens (Okin\n1994). \n\nMarxists also saw marriage as originating in ancient exercises of\nforce and as continuing to contribute to the exploitation of women.\nFriedrich Engels (1820–1895) argued that monogamous marriage issued\nfrom a “world historical defeat of the female sex”\n(Engels 1884, 120). Exclusive monogamy “was not in any way the\nfruit of individual sex love, with which it had nothing whatever to do\n… [but was based on] economic conditions—on the victory\nof private property over primitive, natural communal property”\n(ibid., 128). Monogamy allowed men to control women and\nreproduction, thereby facilitating the intergenerational transfer of private property by producing\nundisputed heirs. Karl Marx (1818–83) argued that abolishing the\nprivate family would liberate women from male ownership, ending their\nstatus “as mere instruments of production” (The\nCommunist Manifesto,  Marx 1848, 173). The Marxist linking of\npatriarchy and capitalism, in particular its understanding of marriage\nas an ownership relation ideologically underpinning the capitalist\norder, has been especially influential in feminist thought (Pateman\n1988, cf. McMurtry 1972). \n\nThe idea that marriage has a special moral status and entails fixed\nmoral obligations is widespread—and philosophically\ncontroversial. Marriage is a legal contract, although an anomalous one\n(see 4.1); as the idea of it as a contract has taken hold, questions\nhave arisen as to how far its obligations should be subject to\nindividual choice. The contractual view of marriage implies that\nspouses can choose marital obligations to suit their interests.\nHowever, to some, the value of marriage consists precisely in the\nlimitations it sets on individual choice in the service of a greater\ngood: thus, Hegel commented that arranged marriage is the most ethical\nform of marriage because it subordinates personal choice to the\ninstitution. The institutional view holds that the purpose of the\ninstitution defines its obligations, taking precedence over\nspouses' desires, either, in the two most prominent forms, in the\nservice of a procreative union, or to protect spousal love. These\ntheories have implications for the moral status of extra-marital sex\nand divorce, as well as the point and purpose of marriage. \n\nOn the contractual view, the moral terms and obligations of marriage\nare taken as a set of promises between spouses. Their content is\nsupplied by surrounding social and legal practices, but their\npromissory nature implies that parties to the promise can negotiate the\nterms and release each other from marital obligations. \n\nOne rationale for treating marital obligations as such promises might be\nthought to be the voluntaristic account of obligation. On this view,\nall special obligations (as opposed to general duties) are the result\nof voluntary undertakings; promises are then the paradigm of special\nobligations (see entry on Special Obligations). Thus, whatever special\nobligations spouses have to one another must originate in voluntary\nagreement, best understood as promise. We will return to this below. A\nsecond rationale is the assumption that existing marriage practices are\nmorally arbitrary, in the sense that there is no special moral reason\nfor their structure. Further, there are diverse social understandings\nof marriage. If the choice between them is morally arbitrary, there is\nno moral reason for spouses to adopt one specific set of marital\nobligations; it is left up to spouses to choose their terms. Thus, the\ncontractual account depends upon the assumption that there is no\ndecisive moral reason for a particular marital structure. \n\nOn the contractual account, not just any contracts count as\nmarriages. The default content of marital promises is supplied by\nsocial and legal practice: sexual exclusivity, staying married, and so\non. But it entails that spouses may release one another from these\nmoral obligations. For example, extra-marital sex has often been\nconstrued as morally wrong by virtue of promise-breaking: if spouses\npromise sexual exclusivity, extra-marital sex breaks a promise and is\nthereby prima facie wrong. However, if marital obligations are\nsimply promises between the spouses, then the parties can release one\nanother, making consensual extra-marital sex permissible (Wasserstrom\n1974). Marriage is also sometimes taken to\ninvolve a promise to stay married. This seems to make unilateral\ndivorce morally problematic, as promisors cannot release themselves\nfrom promissory obligations (Morse 2006). But standard\nconditions for overriding promissory obligations, such as conflict with\nmore stringent moral duties, inability to perform, or default by the\nother party to a reciprocal promise would permit at least some\nunilateral divorces (Houlgate 2005, Chapter 12). Some theorists of\nmarriage have suggested that marital promises are conditional on\nenduring love or fulfilling sex (Marquis 2005, Moller 2003). But this\nassumption is at odds with the normal assumption that promissory\nconditions are to be stated explicitly. \n\nRelease from the marriage promise is not the only condition for\npermissible divorce on the contractual view. Spouses may not be\nobligated to one another to stay married—but they may have\nparental duties to do so: if divorce causes avoidable harm to children,\nit is prima facie wrong (Houlgate 2005, Chapter 12, Russell\n1929, Chapter 16). However, in some cases divorce will benefit the\nchild—as when it is the means to escape abuse. A vast empirical\nliterature disputes the likely effects of divorce on children (Galston\n1991, 283–288, Young 1995). What is notable here, philosophically, is\nthat this moral reason against divorce is not conceived as a spousal,\nbut a parental, duty. \n\nMarriage is widely taken to have an amatory core, suggesting that a\nfurther marital promise is a promise to love, as expressed in wedding\nvows ‘to love and cherish’. But such alleged promises have\nmet with skepticism. If one cannot control whether one loves, the\nmaxim that ‘ought implies can’ entails that one cannot\npromise to love. One line of response has been to suggest that\nmarriage involves a promise not to feel but to behave a certain\nway—to act in ways likely to sustain the relationship. But such\nreinterpretations of the marital promise face a problem: promises\ndepend on what promisors intend to promise—and presumably most\nspouses do not intend to promise mere behavior (Martin 1993, Landau\n2004, Wilson 1989, Mendus 1984, Brake 2012, Chapter 1; see also\nKronqvist 2011). However, developing neuroenhancement technology\npromises to bring love under control through a “love drug”\nwhich would produce bonding hormones such as oxytocin. While the use\nof neuroenhancement to keep one's vows raises questions of\nauthenticity and the nature of love (as well as concerns regarding its\nuse in abusive relationships), it is difficult to see how such\ntechnology morally differs from other love-sustaining devices such as\nromantic dinners—except that it is more likely to be effective\n(Savulescu and Sandberg 2008). \n\nOne objection to the contractual account is that, without appeal to\nthe purpose of the institution, there is no reason why not just any set\nof promises count as marriage (Finnis 2008). The objection continues\nthat the contractual account cannot explain the point of marriage. Some\nmarriage contractualists accept this implication. According to the\n“bachelor's argument,” marriage is irrational:\nchances of a strongly dis-preferred outcome (a loveless marriage) are\ntoo high (Moller 2003). Defenders of the rationality of marriage have\nreplied that marital obligations are rational because they help agents\nto secure their long-term interests in the face of passing desires\n(Landau 2004). From the institutional perspective, evaluating the\nrationality of marriage thus, in terms of fulfilling subjective\npreferences, clashes with the tradition of viewing it as uniquely\nenabling certain objective human goods; however, a positive case must\nbe made for the latter view. \n\nAnother objection to the contractual view concerns voluntarism.\nCritics of the voluntarist approach to the family deny that family\nmorality is exhausted by voluntary obligations (Sommers 1989).\nVoluntarist conceptions of the family conflict with common-sense\nintuitions that there are unchosen special duties between family\nmembers, such as filial duties. However, even if voluntarism is false,\nthis does not suffice to establish special spousal duties. On the other\nhand, voluntarism alone does not entail the contractual view, for it\ndoes not entail that spouses can negotiate the obligations of marriage\nor that the obligations be subject to release, only that spouses must\nagree to them. Voluntarism, in other words, need not extend to the\nchoice of marital obligations and hence need not entail the contractual\naccount. The contractual account depends on denying that there is\ndecisive moral reason for marriage to incorporate certain fixed\nobligations. Let us turn to the case that there is such reason. \n\nThe main theoretical alternatives to the contractual view hold that\nmarital obligations are defined by the purpose of the institution, and\nthat spouses cannot alter these institutional obligations (much like\nthe professional moral obligations of a doctor; to become a doctor, one\nmust voluntarily accept the role and its obligations, but one cannot\nnegotiate the content of these obligations). The challenge for\ninstitutional views is to defend such a view of marriage, explaining\nwhy spouses may not jointly agree to alter obligations associated with\nmarriage. Kant confronted this question, arguing that special marital\nrights were morally necessary for permissible sex. His account of\nsexual objectification has influenced a prominent contemporary rival to\nthe contractual view—the new natural law view, which takes\nprocreation as essential to marriage. A second widespread approach\nfocuses solely on love as the defining purpose of marriage. \n\nLike Kant, the new natural law account of marriage focuses on the\npermissible exercise of sexual attributes; following Aquinas, it\nemphasizes the goods of marriage, which new natural lawyers, notably\nJohn Finnis (cf. George 2000, Grisez 1993, Lee 2008), identify as\nreproduction and fides—roughly, marital friendship\n(see entry on The Natural Law Tradition in Ethics). Marriage is here\ntaken to be the institution uniquely apt for conceiving and rearing\nchildren by securing the participation of both parents in an ongoing\nunion. The thought is that there is a distinctive marital good related\nto sexual capacities, consisting in procreation and fides, and\nrealizable only in marriage. Within marriage, sex may be engaged in for\nthe sake of the marital good. Marital sex need not result in conception\nto be permissible; it is enough that it is open towards procreation and\nexpresses fides. The view does not entail that it is wrong to\ntake pleasure in sex, for this can be part of the marital good. \n\nHowever, sex outside marriage (as defined here) cannot be orientated\ntoward the marital good. Furthermore, sexual activity not orientated\ntoward this good—including same-sex activity, masturbation,\ncontracepted sex, sex without marital commitment (even within legal\nmarriage)—is valueless; it does not instantiate any basic good.\nFurthermore, such activity is impermissible because it violates the\nbasic good of marriage. Marital sex is thought to instantiate the good\nof marriage. By contrast, non-marital sex is thought to treat sexual capacities\ninstrumentally—using them merely for pleasure. (It is here that\nthe account is influenced by Kant.) Non-marital sex violates the good\nof marriage by treating sexual capacities in a way contrary to that\ngood. Furthermore, for an agent merely to condone non-marital sex\ndamages his or her relation to the marital good, for even a\nhypothetical willingness to treat sex instrumentally precludes proper\nmarital commitment (Finnis 1997, 120). \n\nAs Finnis emphasizes, one feature of the new natural law account of\nmarriage is that the structure of marriage can be fully explained by\nits purpose. Marriage is between one man and one woman because this is\nthe unit able to procreate without third-party assistance; permanence\nis required to give children a lifelong family. Finnis charges, as\nnoted above, that accounts which do not ground marriage in this purpose\nhave no theoretical reason to resist the extension of marriage to\npolygamy, incest, and bestiality (Finnis 1995). As all non-marital sex\nfails to instantiate basic goods, there is no way morally to\ndistinguish these different relations. \n\nA further point concerns law: to guide citizens' judgments and\nchoices towards the relationship in which they can uniquely achieve the\nmarital good, the state should endorse marriage, as understood on this\nview, and not recognize same-sex relationships as marriages. However,\nit might be asked whether this is an effective way to guide choice, and\nwhether state resources might be better spent promoting other basic\nhuman goods. Moreover, as the argument equally implies a state interest\nin discouraging contraception, divorce, and extra-marital sex, the\nfocus on same-sex marriage appears arbitrary (Garrett 2008, Macedo\n1995). This objection is a specific instance of a more general\nobjection: this account treats sex and the marital good differently\nthan it does the other basic human goods. Not only is less attention\npaid to promoting those goods legally (and discouraging behavior\ncontrary to them), but the moral principle forbidding action contrary\nto basic human goods is not consistently applied elsewhere—for\nexample, to eating unhealthily (Garrett 2008). \n\nA second objection attacks the claim that non-marital sex cannot\ninstantiate any basic human goods. This implausibly consigns all\nnon-marital sex (including all contracepted sex) to the same value as\nanonymous sex, prostitution, or masturbation (Macedo 1995, 282).\nPlausibly, non-marital sex can instantiate goods such as\n“pleasure, communication, emotional growth, personal stability,\nlong-term fulfillment” (Corvino 2005, 512), or other basic human\ngoods identified by the new natural law account, such as knowledge,\nplay, and friendship (Garrett 2008). \n\nA third objection is related. The view seems to involve a double\nstandard in permitting infertile opposite-sex couples to marry (Corvino\n2005; Macedo 1995). The new natural lawyers have responded that\npenile-vaginal sex is reproductive in type, even if not in effect, while\nsame-sex activity can never be reproductive in type (Finnis 1997, cf.\nGeorge 2000, Lee 2008). Reproductive-type sex can be oriented towards\nprocreation even if not procreative in effect. But it is unclear how\nindividuals who know themselves to be infertile can have sex for the reason of\nprocreation (Macedo 1995, Buccola 2005). Ultimately, to differentiate\ninfertile heterosexual couples from same-sex couples, new natural\nlawyers invoke complementarity between men and women as partners and\nparents. Thus, the defense of this account of marriage turns on a\ncontroversial view of the nature and importance of sexual difference\n(Finnis 1997, Lee 2008). \nA related, influential argument focuses on the definition of\nmarriage. This argues that marriage is necessarily between one man and\none woman because it involves a comprehensive union between spouses, a\nunity of lives, minds, and bodies. Organic bodily union requires being\nunited for a biological purpose, in a procreative-type act (Girgis, et\nal., 2010). Like the new natural law arguments, this has raised\nquestions as to why only, and all, different-sex couples, even\ninfertile ones, can partake in procreative-type acts, and why bodily\nunion has special significance (Arroyo forthcoming, Johnson 2013). \n\nWhile much discussion of new natural law accounts of marriage\noscillates between attacking and defending the basis in biological sex\ndifference, some theorists sympathetic to new natural law attempt to\navoid the Scylla of rigid biological restrictions and the Charybdis of\nliberal “plasticity” regarding marriage (Goldstein\n2011). Goldstein, for one, offers an account of marriage as a project\ngenerated by the basic good of friendship; while this project includes\nprocreation as a core feature, the institution of marriage has, on\nthis account, a compensatory power, meaning that the institution\nitself can compensate for failures such as inability to\nprocreate. Such an account grounds marriage in the new natural law\naccount of flourishing, but it also allows the extension to same-sex\nmarriage without, according to Goldstein, permitting other forms such\nas polygamy. \n\nA second widespread (though less unified) institutional approach to\nmarriage appeals to the ideal marital love relationship to define the\nstructure of marriage. This approach, in the work of different\nphilosophers, yields a variety of specific prescriptions, on, for\nexample, whether marital love (or committed romantic love in general)\nrequires sexual difference or sexual exclusivity (Scruton 1986,\n305–311, Chapter 11, Halwani 2003, 226–242, Chartier\n2016). Some, but not all, proponents explicitly argue that the marital\nlove relationship is an objective good (Scruton 1986, Chapter 11,\n356–361, Martin 1993). These views, however, all take the\nessential feature, and purpose, of marriage to be protecting a sexual\nlove relationship. The thought is that marriage helps to maintain and\nsupport a relationship either in itself valuable, or at least valued\nby the parties to it. \n\nOn this approach, the structure of marriage derives from the behavior\nneeded to maintain such a relationship. Thus marriage involves a\ncommitment to act for the relationship as well as to exclude\nincompatible options—although there is controversy over what\nspecific policies these general commitments entail. To take an\nuncontroversial example, marriage creates obligations to perform acts\nwhich sustain love, such as focusing on the beloved's good qualities\n(Landau 2004). More controversially, some philosophers argue that\nsustaining a love relationship requires sexual exclusivity. The\nthought is that sexual activity generates intimacy and affection, and\nthat objects of affection and intimacy will likely come into\ncompetition, threatening the marital relationship. Another version\nfocuses on the emotional harm, and consequent damage to the\nrelationship, caused by sexual jealousy. Thus, due to the\npsychological conditions required to maintain romantic love, marriage,\nas a love-protecting institution, generates obligations to sexual\nexclusivity (Martin 1993, Martin 1994, Scruton 1986, Chapter 11,\n356–361, Steinbock 1986). However, philosophers dispute the\npsychological conditions needed to maintain romantic love. Some argue\nthat casual extra-marital sex need not create competing relationships\nor trigger jealousy (Halwani 2003, 235; Wasserstrom 1974). Indeed,\nsome have even argued that extra-marital sex, or greater social\ntolerance thereof, could strengthen otherwise difficult marriages\n(Russell 1929, Chapter 16), and some polyamorists (those who engage in\nmultiple sex or love relationships) claim that polyamory allows\ngreater honesty and openness than exclusivity (Emens 2004). Other\nphilosophers have treated sexual fidelity as something of a red\nherring, shifting focus to other qualities of an ideal relationship\nsuch as attentiveness, warmth, and honesty, or a commitment to justice\nin the relationship (Martin 1993, Kleingeld 1998). \n\nViews understanding marriage as protecting love generate diverse\nconclusions regarding its obligations. But such views share two\ncrucial assumptions: that marriage has a role to play in creating a\ncommitment to a love relationship, and that such commitments may be\nefficacious in protecting love (Cave 2003, Landau 2004, Martin 1993,\nMartin 1994, Mendus 1984, Scruton 1986, 356–361). However, both\nof these assumptions may be questioned. First, even if commitment can\nprotect a love relationship, why must such a commitment be made\nthrough a formal marriage? If it is possible to maintain a long-term\nromantic relationship outside marriage, the question as to the point\nof marriage re-emerges: do we really need marriage for love? May not\nthe legal and social supports of marriage, indeed, trap individuals in\na loveless marriage or themselves corrode love by associating it with\nobligation?  (Card 1996, Cave 2003; see also Gheaus 2016) Second, can\ncommitment, within or without marriage, really protect romantic love?\nHigh divorce rates would seem to suggest not. Of course, even if, as\ndiscussed in 3.1, agents cannot control whether they love, they can\nmake a commitment to act in ways protective of love (Landau 2004,\nMendus 1984). But this returns us the difficulty, suggested by the\npreceding paragraph, of knowing how to protect love! \n\nReflecting the difficulty of generating specific rules to protect\nlove, many such views have understood the ethical content of marriage\nin terms of virtues (Steinbock 1991, Scruton\n1986, Chapter 11, 356–361). The virtue approach analyzes marriage in\nterms of the dispositions it cultivates, an approach which, by its\nreference to emotional states, promises to explain the relevance of\nmarriage to love. However, such approaches must explain how marriage\nfosters virtues (Brake 2012). Some virtue accounts cite the effects of\nits social status: marriage triggers social reactions which secure\nspousal privacy and ward off the disruptive attention of outsiders\n(Scruton 1986, 356–361). Its legal obligations, too, can be understood\nas Ulysses\n contracts[1]:\nthey protect relationships when spontaneous\naffection wavers, securing agents' long-term commitments against\npassing desires. Whether or not such explanations ultimately show that\nmarital status and obligations can play a role in protecting love, the\ngeneral focus on ideal marital love relationships may be characterized\nas overly idealistic when contrasted with problems in actual marriages,\nsuch as spousal abuse (Card 1996). This last point suggests that moral\nanalysis of marriage cannot be entirely separated from political and\nsocial inquiry. \n\nIn political philosophy, discussions of marriage law invoke diverse\nconsiderations, reflecting the various theoretical orientations of\ncontributors to the debate. The ensuing discussion will set forth the\nmain considerations brought to bear in arguments concerning the legal\nstructure of marriage. \n\nMarriage is a legal contract, but it has long been recognized to be an\nanomalous one. Until the 1970s in the U.S., marriage law restricted\ndivorce and defined the terms of marriage on the basis of\ngender. Marking a shift towards greater alignment of marriage with\ncontractual principles of individualization, marriage law no longer\nimposes gender-specific obligations, it allows pre-nuptial property\nagreements, and it permits easier exit through no-fault divorce. But\nmarriage remains (at least in U.S. federal law) an anomalous contract:\n“there is no written document, each party gives up its right to\nself-protection, the terms of the contract cannot be re-negotiated,\nneither party need understand its terms, it must be between two and\nonly two people, and [until 2013] these two people must be one man and one\nwoman” (Kymlicka 1991, 88).\n \n\nProponents of the contractualization, or privatization, of marriage\nhave argued that marriage should be brought further into line with the\ncontractual paradigm. A default assumption for some liberals, as for\nlibertarians, is that competent adults should be legally permitted to\nchoose the terms of their interaction. In a society characterized by\nfreedom of contract, restrictions on entry to or exit from marriage, or\nthe content of its legal obligations, appear to be an illiberal\nanomaly. Full contractualization would imply that there should be no law of\nmarriage at all—marriage officiation would be left to religions\nor private organizations, with the state enforcing whatever private\ncontracts individuals make and otherwise not interfering (Vanderheiden\n1999, Sunstein and Thaler 2008, Chartier 2016; for a critique of\ncontractualization, see Chambers 2016). The many legal implications of\nmarriage for benefit entitlements, inheritance, taxation, and so on,\ncan also be seen as a form of state interference in private choice. By\nconferring these benefits, as well as merely recognizing marriage as a\nlegal status, the state encourages the relationships thereby\nformalized (Waldron 1988–89,\n1149–1152).[2] \n\nMarriage is the basis for legal discrimination in a number of\ncontexts; such discrimination requires justification, as does the\nresource allocation involved in providing marital benefits (Cave 2004,\nVanderheiden 1999). In the absence of such justification, providing\nbenefits through marriage may treat the unmarried unjustly, as their\nexclusion from such benefits would then be arbitrary (Card 1996). Thus,\nthere is an onus to provide a rationale justifying such resource\nallocations and legal discrimination on the basis of marriage, as well\nas for restricting marriage in ways that other contracts are not\nrestricted. \n\nBefore exploring some common rationales, it is worth noting that\ncritics of the social contract model of the state and of freedom of\ncontract have used the example of marriage against contractual\nprinciples. First, Marxists have argued that freedom of contract is\ncompatible with exploitation and oppression—and Marxist\nfeminists have taken marriage as a special example, arguing against\ncontractualizing it on these grounds (Pateman 1988,\n162–188). Such points, as we will see, suggest the need for\nrules governing property division on divorce.  Second, communitarians\nhave argued that contractual relations are inferior to those\ncharacterized by trust and affection—again, using marriage as a\nspecial example (Sandel 1982, 31–35, cf. Hegel 1821, §75,\n§161A). This objection applies not only to contractualizing\nmarriage, but more generally, to treating it as a case for application\nof principles of justice: the concern is that a rights-based\nperspective will undermine the morally superior affection between\nfamily members, importing considerations of individual desert which\nalienate family members from their previous unselfish identification\nwith the whole (Sandel 1982, 31–35). However, although marriages\nare not merely an exchange of rights, spousal rights protect spouses'\ninterests when affection fails; given the existence of abuse and\neconomic inequality within marriage, these rights are especially\nimportant for protecting individuals within, and after, marriage\n(Kleingeld 1998, Shanley 2004, 3–30, Waldron 1988). \n\nAs noted, a rationale must be given for marriage law which explains\nthe restrictions placed on entry and exit, the allocation of resources to\nmarriage, and legal discrimination on the basis of it. The next section will\nexamine gender restrictions on entry; this section will examine reasons\nfor recognizing marriage in law at all, allocating resources to it, and\nconstraining property division on divorce. \n\nA first reason for recognizing marriage should be set aside. This is\nthat the monogamous heterosexual family unit is a natural,\npre-political structure which the state must respect in the form in\nwhich it finds it (Morse 2006; cf. new natural lawyers, Girgis et\nal. 2010). But, whatever the natural reproductive unit may be,\nmarriage law, as legislation, is constrained by principles of justice\nconstraining legislation. Within most contemporary political\nphilosophy, the naturalness of a given practice is irrelevant; indeed,\nin no area other than the family is it proposed that law should follow\nnature (with the possible exception of laws regarding\nsuicide). Finally, such objections must answer to feminist concerns\nthat excluding the family unit from principles of justice, allowing\nnatural affection to regulate it, has facilitated inequality and abuse\nwithin it (see section 5). \n\nLet us then begin with the question of why marriage should be\nrecognized in law at all. One answer is that legal recognition conveys\nthe state's endorsement, guiding individuals into a valuable form\nof life (George 2000). A second is that legal recognition is necessary\nto maintain and protect social support for the institution, a valuable\nform of life which would otherwise erode (Raz 1986, 162, 392–3; Scruton\n1986, 356–361; see discussion in Waldron 1988–89). But\nthis prompts the question as to why this form of life is valuable. \n\nIt is sometimes argued that traditions, having stood the test of\ntime, have proved their value. Not only is marriage itself such a\ntradition, but through its child-rearing role it can pass on other\ntraditions (Sommers 1989, Scruton 1986, 356–361, cf. Devlin 1965,\nChapter 4). But many marital traditions—coverture,\ngender-structured legal duties, marital rape exemptions, inter-racial\nmarriage bans—have been unjust. Tradition provides at best a\nprima facie reason for legislation which may be overridden by\nconsiderations of justice. Further, in a diverse society, there are\nmany competing traditions, amongst which this rationale fails to choose\n(Garrett 2008). \n\nAn account of the value of a particular form of marriage itself (and\nnot just qua tradition) is needed. One thought is that\nmonogamous marriage encourages the sexual self-control needed for\nhealth and happiness; another is that it encourages the goods of love\nand intimacy found in committed relationships. State support for\nmonogamous marriage, by providing incentives to enter marital\ncommitments, thus helps people lead better lives (e.g. Macedo 1995,\n286). However, this approach faces objections. First, the explanation\nin terms of emotional goods underdetermines the institution to be\nsupported: other relationships, such as friendships, embody emotional\ngoods. Second, claims about the value of sexual self-control are\ncontroversial; objectors might argue that polygamy, polyamory, or\npromiscuity are equally good options (see 5.2). There is a further\nproblem with this justification, which speaks to a division within\nliberal thought. Some liberals embrace neutrality, the view that the\nstate should not base law on controversial judgments about what\nconstitutes valuable living. To such neutral liberals, this class of\nrationales, which appeal to controversial value judgments about sex\nand love, must be excluded (Rawls 1997, 779). Some theorists have\nsought to develop rationales consistent with political liberalism,\narguing, for instance, that the intimate dyadic marital relationship\nprotects autonomy (Bennett 2003), or that marriage could be justified\nby its role in protecting caring relationships (Brake 2012),\ncaregivers and children (Hartley and Watson 2012; see also May 2016,\nWedgwood 2016).  \n\nIt is widely accepted that the state should protect children. If\ntwo-parent families benefit children, incentives to marry may be\njustified as promoting two-parent families and hence children's\nwelfare. One benefit of two-parent families is economic: there is a\ncorrelation between single motherhood and poverty.  The second benefit\nis emotional: children appear to benefit from having two parents\n(Galston 1991, 283–288). (Moreover, some argue that gender\ncomplementarity in parenting benefits children; but empirical evidence\ndoes not seem to support this [Lee 2008, Nussbaum 1999, 205].) One\nobjection is that marriage is an ineffective child anti-poverty plan.\nFor one thing, this account assumes that incentives to marry will lead\na significant number of parents who would not otherwise have married\nto marry. But marriage and child-rearing have increasingly diverged\ndespite incentives to marry. Second, this approach does not address\nthe many children outside marriages and in poor two-parent\nfamilies. Child poverty could be addressed more efficiently through\ndirect anti-child-poverty programs rather than the indirect strategy\nof marriage (Cave 2004; Vanderheiden 1999; Young 1995). Moreover,\nthere is controversy over the psychological effects of single\nparenthood, particularly over the causality underlying certain\ncorrelations: for instance, are children of divorce unhappier due to\ndivorce itself, or to the high-conflict marriage preceding it? (Young\n1995) Indeed, some authors have recently argued that children might be\nbetter protected by legally separating marriage from parenting:\nfreestanding parenting frameworks would be more durable than marriage\n(which can end in divorce), would protect children outside of\nmarriages, and would accommodate new family forms such as three-parent\nfamilies (Brennan and Cameron 2016, Shrage forthcoming; see also Chan\nand Cutas 2012). \n\nA related, but distinct, line of thought invokes the alleged\npsychological effects of two-parent families to argue that marriage\nbenefits society by promoting good citizenship and state stability\n(Galston 1991, 283–288). This depends on the\nempirical case (as we have seen, a contested one) that children of\nsingle parents face psychological and economic hurdles which threaten\ntheir capacity to acquire the virtues of citizenship. Moreover, if\neconomic dependence produces power inequality within marriage, then\nMill's ‘school of injustice’ objection applies—an\ninstitution teaching injustice is likely to undermine the virtues of\ncitizenship (Okin 1994, Young 1995). \n\nFinally, a rationale for restricting the terms of exit from marriage\n(but not for supporting it as a form of life) is the protection of\nwomen and children following divorce. Women in gender-structured marriages,\nparticularly if they have children, tend to become economically\nvulnerable. Statistically, married women are more likely than their\nhusbands to work in less well-paid part-time work, or to give up paid\nwork entirely, especially to meet the demands of child-rearing. Thus,\nfollowing divorce, women are likely to have a reduced standard of\nliving, even to enter poverty. Because these patterns of choice within\nmarriages lead to inequalities between men and women, property division\non divorce is a matter of equality or equal opportunity, and so a just\nlaw of divorce is essential to gender justice (Okin 1989, Chapters 7\nand 8; Rawls 1997, 787–794; Shanley 2004, 3–30; Waldron\n1988, and see 5.1). However, it can still be asked why\na law recognizing marriage as such should be necessary, as opposed to\ndefault rules governing property distribution when such\ngender-structured relationships end (Sunstein and Thaler 2008). Indeed,\nplacing these restrictions only on marriage, as opposed to enacting\ngeneral default rules, may make marriage less attractive, especially to\nmen, and hence be counter-productive, leaving women more\nvulnerable. \n\nThe preceding two rationales are both weakened by the diminished\nsocial role of marriage; changing legal and social norms undermine its\neffectiveness as a policy tool. In the 20th century,\nmarriage was beset by a “perfect storm”: the expectation\nthat it should be emotionally fulfilling, women's liberation, and\neffective contraception (Coontz 2006, Chapter 16). Legally, exit from\nmarriage has become relatively easy since the ‘no-fault divorce\nrevolution’ of the 1970's. Moreover, cohabitation and\nchild-rearing increasingly take place outside marriage. This reflects\nthe end of laws against unmarried cohabitation and legal discrimination\nagainst children on grounds of ‘illegitimacy’, as well as\ndiminishing social stigmas against such behavior. Given such\nsignificant changes, marriage is at best an indirect strategy for\nachieving goals such as protecting women or children (Cave 2004,\nSunstein and Thaler 2008, Vanderheiden 1999). Some theorists have argued, in the absence of a compelling\nrationale for marriage law, for abolishing marriage altogether,\nreplacing it with civil unions or domestic partnerships.  This line of\nthought will be taken up in 4.4, after an examination of the debate\nover same-sex marriage. \n\nThe proposal to replace marriage entirely with civil unions or\ndomestic partnerships differs from the ‘compromise’\nproposal of a two-tier marriage law: marriage for opposite-sex couples\nonly, and civil unions or domestic partnerships for same-sex and, if\nthey choose, opposite-sex couples. The compromise proposal grants some\nof the benefits of marriage without ceding the title (or indeed, as\nusually proposed, all the benefits) of marriage to same-sex couples.\nThis position does not fully answer arguments for same-sex\nmarriage. \n\nMany arguments for same-sex marriage invoke liberal principles of\njustice such as equal treatment, equal opportunity, and neutrality.\nMarriage provides benefits which are denied to same-sex couples on the\nbasis of their orientation; if the function of marriage is the legal\nrecognition of loving, or “voluntary intimate,”\nrelationships, the exclusion of same-sex relationships appears\narbitrary and unjustly discriminatory (Wellington 1995, 13). Same-sex\nrelationships are relevantly similar to heterosexual relationships\nrecognized as marriages, yet the state denies gays and lesbians access\nto the benefits of marriage, hence treating them unequally (Mohr 2005,\nRajczi 2008, Williams 2011). Further, arguments in support of such discrimination seem\nto depend on controversial moral claims regarding homosexuality of the\nsort excluded by neutrality (Wellington 1995, Schaff 2004, Wedgwood\n1999). \n\nTo see why a two-tier solution fails to address these arguments, we\nmust consider what benefits marriage provides. There are tangible\nbenefits such as eligibility for health insurance and pensions, privacy\nrights, immigration eligibility, and hospital visiting rights (see Mohr\n2005, Chapter 3). Crucially, however, there is also an important\nbenefit of legal, and indirectly social, recognition of a relationship\nas marriage. The status of marriage itself confers legitimacy and\ninvokes social support. The two-tier system does not provide equal\ntreatment because it does not confer on same-sex relationships the\nstatus associated with marriage. \n\nIn addition, some philosophers have argued that excluding gays and\nlesbians from marriage is central to gay and lesbian oppression,\nmaking them ‘second-class citizens’ and underlying social\ndiscrimination against them. Marriage is central to concepts of good\ncitizenship, and so exclusion from it displaces gays and lesbians from\nfull and equal citizenship: “being fit for marriage is\nintimately bound up with our cultural conception of what it means to\nbe a citizen … because marriage is culturally conceived as\nplaying a uniquely foundational role in sustaining civil\nsociety” (Calhoun 2000, 108). From this perspective, the\n‘separate-but-equal’ category of civil unions retains the\nharmful legal symbol of inferiority (Card 2007, Mohr 2005, 89, Calhoun\n2000, Chapter 5; cf. Stivers and Valls 2007; for a comprehensive\nsurvey of these issues, see Macedo 2015). \n\nHowever, if marriage is essentially heterosexual, excluding same-sex\ncouples is not unequal treatment; same-sex relationships simply do not\nqualify as marriages. One case for the essential heterosexuality of\nmarriage invokes linguistic definition: marriage is by definition\nheterosexual, just as a bachelor is by definition an unmarried man\n(Stainton, cited in Mercier 2001). But this confuses meaning and\nreference. Past applications of a term need not yield necessary and\nsufficient criteria for applying it: ‘marriage’, like\n‘citizen’, may be extended to new cases without thereby\nchanging its meaning (Mercier 2001). As noted above, appeal to past\ndefinition begs the question of what the legal definition should be\n(Stivers and Valls 2007). \n\nA normative argument for the essential heterosexuality of marriage\nappeals to its purpose: reproduction in a naturally procreative unit\n(see 3.2.a). But marriage does not require that spouses be able to\nprocreate naturally, or that they intend to do so at all. Further,\nmarried couples adopt and reproduce using donated gametes, rather than\nprocreating ‘naturally’. Nor do proponents of this\nobjection to same-sex marriage generally suggest that entry to marriage\nshould be restricted by excluding those unable to procreate without\nthird-party assistance, or not intending to do so. \n\nIndeed, as the existence of intentionally childless married couples\nsuggests, marriage has purposes other than\nchild-rearing—notably, fostering a committed relationship (Mohr\n2005, Wellington 1995, Wedgwood 1999). This point suggests\na second defense of same-sex marriage: exclusive marital commitments\nare goods which the state should promote amongst same-sex as well as\nopposite-sex couples (Macedo 1995). As noted above,\nsuch rationales come into tension with liberal neutrality; further\ncontroversy regarding them will be discussed below (5.2). \nSome arguments against same-sex marriage invoke a precautionary\nprinciple urging that changes which might affect child welfare be made\nwith extreme caution. But in light of the data available, Murphy\nargues that the precautionary principle has been met with regard to\nharm to children. On his view, parenting is a basic civil right, the\nrestriction of which requires the threat of a certain amount of\nharm. But social science literature shows that children are neither\ntypically nor catastrophically harmed by same-sex parenting. Even if\ntwo biological parents statistically provide the optimal parenting\nsituation, optimality is too high a standard for permitting\nparenting. This can be seen if an optimality condition is imagined for\nother factors, such as education or wealth (Murphy 2011).\n \n\nA third objection made to same-sex marriage is that its proponents\nhave no principled reason to oppose legally recognizing polygamy\n(e.g. Finnis 1997; see Corvino 2005). One response differentiates the\ntwo by citing harmful effects and unequal status for women found in\nmale-headed polygyny, but not in same-sex marriage (e.g. Wedgwood\n1999, Crookston 2014, de Marneffe 2016, Macedo 2015). Another response\nis to bite the bullet: a liberal state should not choose amongst the\nvarious ways (compatible with justice) individuals wish to organize\nsex and intimacy. Thus, the state should recognize a diversity of\nmarital relationships—including polygamy (Calhoun 2005, Mahoney\n2008) or else privatize marriage, relegating it to private contract\nwithout special legal recognition or definition (Baltzly 2012). \n\nFinally, some arguments against same-sex marriage rely on judgments\nthat same-sex sexual activity is impermissible. As noted above, the\nsoundness of these arguments aside, neutrality and political\nliberalism exclude appeal to such contested moral views in justifying\nlaw in important matters (Rawls 1997, 779, Schaff 2004, Wedgwood\n1999).  However, some arguments against same-sex marriage have\ninvoked neutrality, on the grounds that legalizing same-sex marriage\nwould force some citizens to tolerate what they find morally abhorrent\n(Jordan 1995, and see Beckwith 2013). But this reasoning seems to\nimply, absurdly, that mixed-race marriage, where that is the subject\nof controversy, should not be legalized. A rights claim to equal\ntreatment (if such a claim can support same-sex marriage) trumps\noffense caused to those who disagree; the state is not required to be\nneutral in matters of justice (Beyer 2002; Boonin 1999; Schaff 2004;\nsee also Barry 2011, Walker 2015). \nA number of theorists have argued for the abolition or restructuring\nof marriage. While same-sex marriage became legally recognized\nthroughout the United States following the Supreme Court decision\nin Obergefell v Hodges 576 U.S. _ (2015), some philosophers\ncontend that justice requires further reform. Some have proposed that\ntemporary marriage contracts be made available (Nolan 2016, Shrage\n2013) and that legal frameworks for marriage and parenting be\nseparated (Brennan and Cameron 2016, Shrage forthcoming). A more\nsweeping view, to be discussed in Section 5, is that marriage is in\nitself oppressive and unjust, and hence ought to be abolished (Card\n1996, Fineman 2004, Chambers 2013). A second argument for\ndisestablishing or privatizing legal marriage holds that, in the\nabsence of a pressing rationale for marriage law (as discussed in\n4.2), the religious or ethical associations of marriage law give\nreason for abolishing marriage as a legal category. Marriage has\nreligious associations in part responsible for public controversy over\nsame-sex marriage. If marriage is essentially defined by a\nreligious or ethical view of the good, then legal recognition of it\narguably violates state neutrality or even religious freedom (Metz\n2010, but see Macedo 2015, May 2016, Wedgwood 2016).\n There are several reform proposals compatible with the\n‘disestablishment’ of marriage. One proposal is full\ncontractualization or privatization, leaving marriage to churches and\nprivate organizations. “Marital contractualism” (MC) would\nrelegate spousal agreements to existing contract law, eradicating any\nspecial legal marital status or rights. Garrett has defended MC as the\ndefault position, arguing that state regulation of contracts between\nspouses and state expenditures on marriage administration and\npromotion need justification. On his view, efficiency, equality,\ndiversity, and informed consent favor MC; there is no adequate\njustification for the costly redistribution of taxpayer funds to the\nmarried, or for sustaining social stigma against the unmarried through\nlegal marriage (Garrett 2009, see also Chartier 2016).  But marriage confers rights not available through private contract\nand which arguably should not be eliminated—such as evidentiary\nprivilege or special eligibility for immigration.  A second proposal\nwould retain such rights while abolishing marriage; on this proposal,\nthe state ought to replace civil marriage entirely with a secular\nstatus such as civil union or domestic partnership, which could serve\nthe purpose of identifying significant others for benefit\nentitlements, visiting rights, and so on (March 2010, 2011). This\nwould allow equal treatment of same-sex relationships while reducing\ncontroversy, avoiding non-neutrality, and respecting the autonomy of\nreligious organizations by not compelling them to recognize same-sex\nmarriage (Sunstein and Thaler 2008). However, neither solution\nresolves the conflict between religious autonomy and equality for\nsame-sex relationships. Privatization does not solve this conflict so\nlong as religious organizations are involved in civil\nsociety—for example, as employers or benefit providers. The\nquestion is whether religious autonomy would allow them, in such\nroles, to exclude same-sex civil unions from benefits. Such exclusion\ncould be defended as a matter of religious autonomy; but it could also\nbe objected to as unjust discrimination—as it would be if, for\nexample, equal treatment were denied to inter-racial marriages. Another issue raised by such a reform proposal is how to delimit\nthe relationships entitled to such recognition. Recall the new natural\nlaw charge that liberalism entails an objectionable\n“plasticicty” regarding marriage (3.2.1). One question is\nwhether recognition should be extended to polygamous or polyamorous\nrelationships. Some defenders of same-sex marriage hold that their\narguments do not entail recognizing polygamy, due to its oppressive\neffects on women (Wedgwood 1999). However, some monogamous marriages\nare also oppressive (March 2011), and egalitarian polygamous or\npolyamorous relationships, such as a group of three women or three\nmen, exist (Emens, 2004). Thus, oppressiveness does not cleanly\ndistinguish monogamous from polygamous relationships. Brooks has\nsought to show that polygamy is distinctively structurally\ninegalitarian as one party (usually the husband) can determine who\nwill join the marriage, whereas wives cannot (Brooks 2009). However,\nthis overlooks various possible configurations—if a polygamous\n“sister wife,” for instance, has the legal right to marry\noutside the existing marriage, there is no structural inequality\n(Strauss 2012). Most fundamentally, some authors have urged that a\npolitically liberal state should not prescribe the arrangements in\nwhich its competent adult members seek love, sex, and intimacy, so\nlong as they are compatible with justice (Calhoun 2005, March\n2011). Some philosophers have argued that polygamists and polyamorous\npeople are unjustly excluded from the benefits of marriage, and that\nlegal recognition of plural marriage - or small groups of friends –\ncan preserve equality (Brake 2014, Den Otter 2015, Shrage\n2016). Finally, the history of racialized stigmatization of polygamy\ngives reason to consider whether anti-polygamous intuitions rest on\njust foundations (Denike 2010). Conservatives also charge that the liberal approach cannot rule out\nincestuous marriage. While this topic has sparked less debate than\npolygamy, one defender of the civil-unions-for-all proposal has\npointed out that civil union status, as justified on politically\nliberal grounds, would not connote sexual or romantic\ninvolvement. Thus, eligibility of adult family members for this status\nwould not convey state endorsement of incest; whether the state should\nprohibit or discourage this is an independent question (March\n2010).  \nA further problem arises with the proposal to replace marriage with\ncivil unions on neutrality grounds. Civil unions, if they carry legal\nbenefits similar to marriage, would still involve legal discrimination\n(between members of civil unions and those who were not members)\nrequiring justification (for a specific example of this problem in the\narea of immigration law, see Ferracioli 2016).  Depending on how\nrestrictive the entry criteria for civil unions were (for example,\nwhether more than two parties, blood relations, and those not\nromantically involved could enter) and how extensive the entitlements\nconferred by such unions were, the state would need to provide reason\nfor this discrimination. In the absence of compelling neutral reasons\nfor such differential treatment, liberty considerations suggest the\nstate should cease providing any special benefits to members of civil\nunions (or intimate relationships) (Vanderheiden 1999, cf. Sunstein\nand Thaler 2008). As noted in 4.2, some political liberals have sought\nto provide rationales showing why a liberal state should support\ncertain relationships; these rationales generate corresponding reform\nproposals. One approach focuses on protecting economically dependent\ncaregivers; Metz proposes replacing civil marriage with\n“intimate care-giving unions” which would protect the\nrights of dependent caregivers (Metz 2010; cf. Hartley and Watson\n2012). Another approach holds that caring relationships themselves -\nwhether friendships or romantic relationships - should be recognized\nas valuable by the politically liberal state, and it should,\naccordingly, distribute rights supporting them equally; the\ncorresponding reform proposal, “minimal marriage,” would\nprovide rights directly supporting relationships, but not economic\nbenefits, without restriction as to sex or number of parties (Brake\n2012). Many of the views discussed to this point imply that current\nmarriage law is unjust due to arbitrarily excluding some groups from\nbenefits; it follows, on such views, that marrying is to avail oneself\nof privileges unjustly extended. This seems to give reason for\nboycotting the institution, so long as some class of persons are\nunjustly excluded (Parsons 2008). \nFinally, reform to accommodate marriages involving at least one\ntranssexual person (“trans-marriages”) poses conceptual\nquestions regarding law and gender. Currently, U.S. law is in\npatchwork concerning such marriages; as a transsexual person travels\nfrom state to state, both her legal sex and her marital status may\nchange (Cannon 2009, 85). While there are reasons of efficiency and\njustice to recognize trans-marriages (such as ensuring inheritance\nrights), Robson suggests that the underlying rationale of such\nlegislation will be problematic from a feminist standpoint critical of\nthe gender/sex system. For instance, legislation affirming such\nmarriages has done so due to the possibility of penile-vaginal\nintercourse, reaffirming heterosexual norms (Robson 2007). But to\nother theorists, the possibility of trans-marriage itself suggests the\ninstability or incoherence of legal gender categories and gendered\nrestrictions on marriage (Cannon 2009, Almeida 2012). \n\nMarriage historically played a central role in women's\noppression, meaning economic and political disempowerment and\nlimitation of opportunities. Until the late 19th century,\nthe doctrine of coverture (in English and U.S. law) suspended a\nwife's legal personality on marriage, ‘covering’ it\nwith that of her husband, removing her rights to own property, make a\nwill, earn her own money, make contracts, or leave her husband, and\ngiving her little recourse against physical abuse. Well into the\n20th century, legislatures continued to impose gendered\nlegal roles within marriage (known as ‘head and master laws’), to exempt\nrape within marriage from criminal prosecution, and to allow—or\nimpose—professional bars on married women (Coontz 2006, 238; Cronan\n1973; Kleingeld 1998). John Stuart Mill compared wives' condition\nunder coverture to slavery (see section 1); while the late\n20th century U.S. saw gender-neutrality in legal marital\nresponsibilities and an end to the marital rape exemption, criticisms\nof marriage as oppressive persist. Contemporary feminist attention to\nmarriage is focused on spousal abuse—indeed, some U.S. states\nstill exempt spouses from sexual battery charges (Posner and Silbaugh\n1996)—, the gendered division of labor in marriage, and the effects of\nmarriage on women's economic opportunities and power. \n\nWhile Mill and Engels saw the establishment of monogamous marriage\nas an ancient defeat of the female sex, Aquinas, Kant, and many others\nhave seen monogamy as a victory for women, securing for them faithful partners,\nprotection, and material support. So Kant writes that “skepticism\non this topic [marriage] is bound to have bad consequences for the\nwhole feminine sex, because this sex would be degraded to a mere means\nfor satisfying the desire of the other sex, which, however, can easily\nresult in boredom and unfaithfulness.—Woman becomes free by\nmarriage; man loses his freedom by it” (Kant 1798, 210–211,\n[309]). However, as a historical thesis about the origin of marriage,\nthe idea that monogamy provided women with needed material support has\nbeen debunked. In early hunting-gathering societies, female foraging\nlikely provided more than male hunting, child-care was arranged\ncommunally, and, rather than a single male providing for his female\npartner, survival required a much larger group (Coontz 2006, 37–38). As\na thesis about the protection of women by their male partners, the\nincidence of rape and violence by male partners themselves must be\ntaken into account (e.g., in the contemporary U.S. context, Tjaden and\nThoennes 2000). And as a thesis about sex difference, evolutionary\n‘just-so’ stories purporting to show that women are\nnaturally more monogamous have been challenged by feminist philosophers\nof biology (Tuana 2004). \n\nMarriage law has also been a tool of racial oppression. The majority\nof American states at one time prohibited inter-racial marriage; the\nSupreme Court struck down such laws in 1967 (Wallenstein 2002,\n253–254). Anti-miscegenation law did not prevent actual miscegenation,\nbut it excluded women of color and their children from the benefits of\nmarriage. It was also a potent symbol of alleged racial difference.\nFurthermore, African-American marriage patterns were shaped by slavery.\nEnslaved persons could not legally marry, and slave couples and their children\nwere frequently separated (Cott 2000). Contemporary philosophers of race argue that\nmarriage is still implicated in systemic racism (Collins 1998). For\nexample, historical conditions have led to practices of shared\nchild-rearing in African-American communities. Some theories of\nmarriage imply that such child-rearing practices are inferior to the\nmarital family. Theorists of racial oppression argue that such\npractices should be recognized as a valuable alternative, and,\nmoreover, that law which excludes such practices from benefits accorded\nto marriage may be racially unjust (Vanderheiden 1999; cf. Collins 1998, Card 1996). \nRecent work has also highlighted the contemporary marriage gap in the\nU.S.: wealthier people are more likely to marry (McClain 2013). This\nsuggests a different kind of link between marriage and oppression: one\neffect of socioeconomic inequality may be to deprive the worse-off of\naccess to marriage (perhaps because poverty impedes the formation of\nstable relationships), and the further legal benefits marriage can\nbring. There is arguably a tension, among egalitarian approaches,\nbetween criticizing marriage as inherently oppressive and criticizing\nbarriers to accessing it (Chambers 2013). \n\nA major theme in feminist political philosophy has been the\nexclusion of the marital family from justice. Political philosophy has\ntended to relegate the inner workings of the family to natural\nhierarchy or affection (Okin 1979, 1989). Historically, this meant that\nthe private sphere of marriage, to which women were confined, was also\nthe zone of state non-interference, so that what happened to women\nthere was not subject to norms of justice. Gradually, law and political\nphilosophy have come to recognize that equal rights and liberties\nshould be upheld within the private sphere as without, but many\npolitical philosophers still resist applying principles of justice\ndirectly within the private sphere. However, feminists argue that today\ngender-structured marriage contributes to, or is even the mainstay of, women's\neconomic inequality and disempowerment, and that justice must therefore\nregulate its terms—even, perhaps, to the point of interfering\nwith voluntary marital relations. \n\nAs noted above, one persistent rationale for excluding the family\nfrom norms of justice is that its natural relations of affection and\ntrust are superior to merely just relations and likely to be threatened\nby construing the family in terms of justice (Hegel 1821, §75,\n§161A; Sandel 1982, 31–35). But abuse within marriage and\ninequality on dissolution are significant problems, the gravity of\nwhich should, according to critics, outweigh these finer virtues;\nrights within marriage protect spouses when affection fails (Waldron\n1988). Moreover, it is not clear that affection and justice must\nconflict; a commitment to treating one's spouse justly could be\npart of marital love (Kleingeld 1998). Finally, marriage is part of the\nbasic structure of society, and thus, at least within Rawlsian\nliberalism, is subject to principles of justice. This does not\ndetermine, however, how principles of justice should constrain\nmarriage; the default liberal presumption is that marriage, as a\nvoluntary association, should be ordered as spouses choose—so\nlong as these choices do not lead to injustice (Rawls 1997, 792). We\nwill return to this below. \n\nMarriage is a focus of feminist concern due to its effects on\nwomen's life chances. Continuing disadvantage accruing to women\nin marriage has been widely documented, and in some feminist analyses,\nundergirds gender inequality (rival accounts place greater emphasis on\nsexual objectification or workplace discrimination). Wives, even those\nwho work full-time outside the home, perform more housework than\nhusbands—this ‘second shift’ affecting their\nworkplace competitiveness. The social assignment of primary\nresponsibility for childcare to women, combined with the difficulty of\ncombining childcare with paid work, also undermine the workplace\ncompetitiveness of women with children (Maushart 2001, Okin 1989,\nChapter 7). The gendered division of labor and the fact that\n‘women's work’ is less well-paid than men's\ntogether make it more likely that married women, rather than their\nhusbands, will downgrade their careers, choose part-time work, or stay\nhome to facilitate child-rearing or when the spouses' careers\nconflict. These choices make women “vulnerable by\nmarriage”: economic dependence, and dependence on marriage for\nbenefits such as health insurance, fosters power inequality and makes\nexit difficult, in turn facilitating abuse (Okin 1989, Chapter 7, Card\n1996, Brake 2016, Ferguson 2016). \n\nAs discussed in 4.2, rationales of equality or equal opportunity are\ngiven for addressing economic inequalities arising within marriage\nthrough divorce law (Okin 1989, Chapters 7 and 8; Shanley 2004,\n3–30, Rawls 1997, 787–794). However, divorce law does not\naddress non-economic sources of power imbalances (such as gender role\nsocialization) within on-going marriages, nor does it address the\nsystemic way in which such inequalities arise. Equal opportunity seems\nto require changing social norms related to marriage in ways which\ndivorce law does not. First, the gendered division of labor within\nongoing marriages is costly for women (Kleingeld 1998, Maushart 2001).\nSecond, power imbalances within marriage limit girls' expectations and\nteach children to accept gendered inequality (Okin 1989, Chapter 7,\nOkin 1994). Third, anticipation of marriage affects women's investment\nin their earning ability before marriage (Okin 1989, Chapter 7). (But\nfor an argument that some hierarchy and inequality in marriage is\njust, see Landau 2012.) \n\nSuch social norms could be addressed through education or through\nmedia campaigns promoting the equitable division of housework. Legal\nmeasures such as requiring all marital income to be held equally could\nencourage power equality within marriage (Okin 1989, Chapter 8).\nHowever, state interference in on-going marriages arguably conflicts\nwith spouses' liberties (Rawls 1997, 787–794). This seems to raise a\ntheoretical problem for liberal feminism. Recent liberal feminist\napproaches to marriage focus on how a just law of marriage can protect\nwomen's interests, as well as how background measures such as\neducation can address social gender inequality (Brake 2012, Chapter 7;\nHartley and Watson 2012). \n\nWhile many feminists have focused on the reform of marriage, others\nhave argued for its abolition (Chambers 2013). It is sometimes claimed that marriage\nis inherently structured, socially, by sexist norms, precluding the\npossibility of true feminist reform. On such views, abolishing\nmarriage is necessary to reshape social expectations and change\npatterns of choice accompanying it. For example, legal marriage may\nencourage women's economic dependence by enabling and providing\nincentives for it. Thus, the legal structure of marriage, in\ncombination with social norms, is taken to encourage choices which\ndisempower women relative to men. Moreover, legal recognition of\nmarriage itself endorses an ideal of a central, exclusive love\nrelationship which, on the views of some feminists, encourages women\nto make disadvantageous choices by inculcating an exaggerated valuation\nof such relationships—at the expense of women's other\naspirations. Thus, in The Second Sex, feminist philosopher\nSimone de Beauvoir (1908–86) identified the expectations surrounding\nmarriage as one of the primary means by which women are socialized\ninto a femininity which, in her view, was limiting: marriage “is\nthe destiny traditionally offered to women by society” (de\nBeauvoir 1949 [1989], 425), leading women to focus on their attractiveness as\nmates—and not on study, career, or other ambitions. For this\nreason, some feminists have rejected ideals of romantic, exclusive\nlove relationships, arguing that women should choose non-monogamy or\nlesbian separatism (Firestone 1970). The idea that marriage is\nessentially tied to such an ideal of romantic love will require\nfurther examination in the next section. \n\nJust as some feminists argue that marriage is inherently sexist, so\nsome philosophers of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender\noppression argue that it is essentially heterosexist.  (Some of these\nphilosophers refer to themselves as queer theorists in an effort to\nhelp reclaim the word “queer” from its earlier, pejorative usage.)\nQueer theorists have sought to demonstrate that a wide range of social\ninstitutions display heteronormativity, that is, the assumption of\nheterosexuality and of the gender difference that defines it, as a\nnorm.  Because queer theorists resist the normativity of gender as\nwell as of heterosexuality, there is an overlap between their\ncritiques of marriage and those of some feminists, especially lesbian\nfeminists.  For these critics of heteronormativity, same-sex marriage\nis undesirable because it would assimilate same-sex relationships to\nan essentially heterosexual marital ideal: “Queer theorists worry that\npursuing marriage rights is assimilationist, because it rests on the\nview that it would be better for gay and lesbian relationships to be\nas much like traditional heterosexual intimate relationships as\npossible” (Calhoun 2000, 113). On this view, extending marriage to\nsame-sex marriage will undermine, rather than achieve, gay and lesbian\nliberation. \n\nRecall that some arguments for same-sex marriage claim that central,\nexclusive relationships are valuable, and that same-sex marriage would\nbenefit gays and lesbians by encouraging them to enter such\nrelationships (e.g. Macedo 2005; see 3.3). But critics\nof heteronormativity, drawing on gay and lesbian experience, have\nargued that the central, exclusive relationship ideal is a\nheterosexual paradigm. Such critics note that gays and lesbians often\nchoose relationships which are less possessive and more flexible than\nmonogamous marriage. Instead of recognizing the diverse relationships\nfound in the gay and lesbian community, same-sex marriage would\nassimilate lesbian and gay relationships into the heterosexual\nmodel. While some advocates of same-sex marriage argue that marital\nstatus would confer legitimacy on same-sex relationships, these\ncritics argue that the state should not confer legitimacy (and hence,\nimplicitly, illegitimacy) on consensual adult relationships, any more\nthan it should so discriminate between children born in or out of\nwedlock. Such conferrals of legitimacy are thought to discourage\ndiversity. Moreover, same-sex marriage would expose gays and lesbians\nto the disadvantages, even evils, of marriage: economic incentives to\nstay in loveless marriages and reduced exit options which facilitate\nabuse and violence (Card 1996, 2007, Ettelbrick 1989). \n\nOther philosophers of gay and lesbian oppression have responded in\ndefense of same-sex marriage that it not only serves gay liberation, it\nis essential to it. Excluding gays and lesbians from marriage marks\nthem as inferior, and so same-sex marriage would decrease stigmas\nagainst homosexuality. Further, the costs of same-sex marriage must be\nweighed with benefits such as healthcare, custody and inheritance\nrights, and tax and immigration status (Calhoun 2000,\nChapter 5, Ferguson 2007, Mayo and Gunderson 2000). Finally, in\nresponse to worries about gay and lesbian assimilation, defenders of\nsame-sex marriage have argued that marriage can incorporate diversity,\nrather than suppressing it. Marriage need not entail monogamy; indeed,\nit is argued that same-sex marriage could perform the liberatory\nfunction of teaching heterosexuals that neither gender roles nor\nmonogamy are essential to love and marriage (Mohr 2005, 69–9, cf.\nHalwani 2003, Chapter 3). \n\nThe feminist and queer critiques of marriage as essentially sexist, or essentially\nheterosexist, face the same objection as do other claims about the\nessence of marriage. Just because marriage has in the past possessed\ncertain features does not entail that they are inherent to it. Thus,\nrather than reproducing sexist and heterosexist patterns, same-sex\nmarriage could serve women's and gay liberation by transforming\nmarriage, even, perhaps, opening the door to recognition of a still\nwider variety of family forms (Ferguson 2007, Mayo and\nGunderson 2000, Calhoun 2005).","contact.mail":"Elizabeth.Brake@asu.edu","contact.domain":"asu.edu"}]
