In so\ncharacterizing the problem, Strauss was tapping into currents of\nthought deep in the history of political reflection in the west, ones\nabout the nature, extent, and justification of political\nauthority. Do monarchies owe their authority to divine\nright? Has God delegated to secular rulers such as kings and\nemperors the authority to wage war in order to achieve religious\naims: the conversion of the infidel or the repulsion of unjust attacks\non the true faith? Do secular rulers have the authority to suppress\nheretics? What authority does the state retain when its principles\nconflict with God's? Is the authority of the natural law ultimately\ngrounded in divine law? These and other questions animated much of the\ndiscussion among medieval and modern philosophers alike.\n\n\n\nWith the emergence of liberal democracy in the modern west, however,\nthe types of questions that philosophers asked about the interrelation\nbetween religion and political authority began to shift, in large\nmeasure because the following three-fold dynamic was at work. In the\nfirst place, divine-authorization accounts of political authority had\nlost the day to consent-based approaches. Political authority in a\nliberal democracy, most prominent defenders of liberal democracy\nclaimed, is grounded in the consent of the people to be ruled rather\nthan in God's act of authorization. Second, the effects of the\nProtestant Reformation had made themselves felt acutely, as the\nbroadly homogeneous religious character of Western Europe\ndisintegrated into competing religious communities. The population of\nWestern Europe and the United States were now not only considerably\nmore religiously diverse, but also deeply wary of the sort of\nbloodshed occasioned by the so-called religious wars. And, finally,\nsecularization had begun to take hold. Both the effects of religious\ndiversity and prominent attacks on the legitimacy of religious belief\nensured that one could no longer assume in political discussion that\none's fellow citizens were religious, let alone members of one's own\nreligious tradition.\n\n\n\n For citizens of contemporary liberal\ndemocracies, this three-fold dynamic has yielded a curious\nsituation. On the one hand, most take it for granted that the\nauthority of the state is located in the people, that the people are\nreligiously diverse, and that important segments of people doubt the\nrationality of religious belief and practice of any sort. On the\nother hand, contrary to the predictions of many advocates of\nsecularization theory, such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, and (at one time)\nPeter Berger, this mix of democracy, religious diversity, and religious\ncriticism has not resulted in the disappearance or privatization of\nreligion. Religion, especially in liberal democracies such as the\nUnited States, is alive and well, shaping political culture in numerous\nways. Consequently, there very much remains a\ntheologico-political problem. The problem, moreover, still\nconcerns political authority, though now reframed by the transition to\nliberal democracy. If recent reflection on the issue is any\nguide, the most pressing problem to address is this: Given that\nstate-authorized coercion needs to be justified, and that the\njustification of state coercion requires the consent of the people,\nwhat role may religious reasons play in justifying state\ncoercion? More specifically, in a religiously pluralistic context\nsuch as one finds in contemporary liberal democracies, are religious\nreasons sufficient to justify a coercive law for which reasonable\nagents cannot find an adequate secular rationale?\n\n\n\n This article considers the most important\nanswers to these questions offered by recent philosophers, political\ntheorists, and theologians. We present these answers as part of a\nlively three-way discussion between advocates of what we call the\nstandard view, their liberal critics, and proponents of the so-called\nNew Traditionalism. Briefly stated, advocates of the standard\nview argue that in contemporary liberal democracies, significant\nrestraints must be put on the political role of religious\nreasons. Their liberal critics deny this, or at least deny that\ngood reasons have been given to believe this. New\nTraditionalists, by contrast, turn their back on both the standard view\nand its liberal critics, arguing that religious orthodoxy and liberal\ndemocracy are fundamentally incompatible. To have a grip on this\nthree-way debate, we suggest, is to understand that dimension of the\ntheologico-political problem that most animates philosophical\nreflection in liberal democracies on the relation between religion and\npolitics.\n\n\n\nThe standard view among political theorists, such as Robert Audi,\nJürgen Habermas, Charles Larmore, Steven Macedo, Martha Nussbaum,\nand John Rawls is that religious reasons can play only a limited role\nin justifying coercive laws, as coercive laws that require a religious\nrationale lack moral\n legitimacy.[2]\nIf the standard view is correct, there is\nan important asymmetry between religious and secular reasons in the\nfollowing respect: some secular reasons can themselves justify state\ncoercion but no religious reason can. This asymmetry between the\njustificatory potential of religious and secular reasons, it is further\nclaimed, should shape the political practice of religious\nbelievers. According to advocates of the standard view, citizens\nshould not support coercive laws for which they believe there is no\nplausible secular rationale, although they may support coercive laws\nfor which they believe there is only a secular rationale. (Note \nthat not just any secular rationale counts.)  We can refer\nto this injunction to exercise restraint as The Doctrine of\nReligious Restraint (or the DRR, for\n short).[3]\nThis abstract\ncharacterization of the DRR will require some refinements, which we'll\nprovide in sections 2 and 3. For the time being, however, we can\nget a better feel for the character of the DRR by considering the\nfollowing case. \n\nRick is a politically engaged citizen who intends to vote in a\nreferendum on a measure that would criminalize homosexual\nrelations. As he evaluates the relevant considerations, he concludes\nthat the only persuasive rationale for that measure includes as a\ncrucial premise the claim that homosexual relations are contrary to a\nGod-established natural order. Although he finds that rationale\ncompelling, he realizes that many others do not. But because he takes\nhimself to have a general moral obligation to make those political\ndecisions that, as best he can tell, are both just and good, he\ndecides to vote in favor of criminalization. Moreover, he tries to\npersuade his compatriots to vote with him. In so doing, he offers\nrelevantly different arguments to different audiences. He tries to\nconvince like-minded citizens by appealing to the theistic natural law\nargument that he finds persuasive.  But he realizes that many of his\nfellow citizens are unpersuaded by the natural law argument that\nconvinces him. So he articulates a variety of other\narguments—some secular, some religious—that he hopes will\nleverage those who don't share his natural law theism into supporting\nhis position. He does so even though he doubts that any of those\nleveraging arguments are cogent, realizes that many of those to whom\nhe addresses them will have comparable doubts about their cogency, and\nso believes that many coerced by the law he supports have no good\nreason, from their perspective, to affirm that law. \n\n Advocates of the standard view will\nbe troubled by Rick's behavior. The relevantly troubling feature\nof Rick's behavior is not primarily his decision to support this\nparticular policy. Rather, it is his decision to support a policy\nthat he believes others have no good reason, from their perspective, to\nendorse. After all, Rick votes to enact a law that authorizes state coercion even\nthough he believes that the only plausible rationale for that decision\nincludes religious claims that many of his compatriots find utterly\nunpersuasive. In so doing, Rick violates a normative constraint\nat the heart of the standard view, viz., that citizens in a pluralistic\nliberal democracy ought to refrain from using their political influence\nto authorize coercive laws that, to the best of their knowledge, can be\njustified only on religious grounds and so lack a plausible\nsecular\n rationale.[4]\nOr, otherwise put, Rick violates the DRR. For the DRR tells us\nthat, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she should\nsupport some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for that law, then she may not support\nit. \n\n The DRR is a negative constraint; it\nidentifies a kind of reason that cannot itself justify a coercive law\nand so a kind of reason on which citizens may not exclusively rely when\nsupporting a coercive law. But this negative constraint is typically conjoined with a\npermission: although citizens may not support coercive laws for which\nthey believe themselves to have only a religious rationale, they may\nsupport coercive laws for which they believe there is only a plausible\nsecular rationale. As we'll see in a moment, advocates of the DRR\nfurnish reasons to believe that religious and secular reasons have this\nasymmetrical justificatory role. \n\nThe standard view has often been misunderstood, typically by\nassociating the DRR with claims its advocates are free to deny.\nIt will therefore be helpful to dissociate the DRR from various common\nmisunderstandings. \n\n First, the DRR is a moral constraint,\none that applies to people in virtue of the fact that they are citizens\nof a liberal democracy. As such, it need not be encoded into law,\nenforced by state coercion or social stigma, promoted in state\neducational institutions, or in any other way policed by the powers\nthat be. Of course, advocates of restraint are free to argue that\nthe state should police violations of the DRR (see Habermas 2006,\n 10).[5]\nPerhaps some liberal democracies do police something like the\nDRR. But advocates of the standard view needn't endorse\nrestrictions of this\n sort.[6] \n\n Second, the DRR does not\nrequire a thorough-going privatization of religious commitment.\nIndeed, the DRR permits religious considerations to\nplay a rather prominent role in a citizen's political practice:\ncitizens are permitted to vote for their favored coercive policies on\nexclusively religious grounds as well as to advocate publicly for those\npolicies on religious grounds. What the DRR does require of\ncitizens is that they reasonably believe that they have some plausible\nsecular rationale for each of the coercive laws that they support,\nwhich they are prepared to offer in political discussion.\nIn this respect, the present construal of the DRR is weaker than comparable\nproposals, such as that developed by Robert Audi, which requires that\neach citizen have and be motivated by some evidentially adequate\nsecular rationale for each of the coercive laws he or she supports (see\nAudi 1997, 138 and Rawls 1997, 784ff). \n\n Third, the DRR places few restrictions on\nthe content of the secular reasons to which citizens can appeal when\nsupporting coercive laws. Although the required secular reasons\nmust be “plausible” (more on this in a moment), they \nmay make essential reference to what Rawls\ncalls “comprehensive conceptions of the good,” such as Platonism,\nKantianism, or\n utilitarianism.[7]\nAccordingly, the standard view does not\ncommit itself to a position according to which secular reasons must be\nincluded or otherwise grounded in a neutral source—a set of\nprinciples regarding justice and the common good such that everybody\nhas good reason, apart from his own or any other religious or\nphilosophical perspective, to find acceptable. Somewhat more\nspecifically, advocates of the standard view needn't claim that\nsecular reasons must be found in what Rawls calls “public\nreason,” which (roughly speaking) is a fund of shared principles\nabout justice and the common good constructed from the shared\npolitical culture of a liberal democracy. That having been said, it is\nworth stressing that some prominent advocates of the standard view\nadopt a broadly Rawlsian account of the DRR, according to which\ncoercive laws must be justified by appeal to public reason (see\nGutmann and Thompson 1996, Larmore 1987, Macedo 1990, and\nNussbaum 2008). We shall have more to say about this view in section\n6. \n\n Fourth, the DRR itself has no determinate\npolicy implications; it is a constraint not on legislation itself, but\non the configuration of reasons to which agents may appeal when\nsupporting coercive legislation. So, for example, it forbids Rick\nto support the criminalization of homosexuality when he believes that\nthere are no plausible secular reasons to criminalize it. As\nsuch, the moral propriety of the DRR has nothing directly to do with\nits usefulness in furthering, or discouraging, particular policy\naims. \n\n The DRR, then, is a norm that is\nsupposed to provide guidance for how citizens of a liberal democracy\nshould conduct themselves when deliberating about or deciding on the implementation of\ncoercive laws. For our purposes, it will be helpful to work with\na canonical formulation of it. Let us, then, formulate the DRR as\nfollows: \n\nAbout this formulation of the DRR, let us make two points.\nFirst, in what follows, we will remain largely noncommittal about what\nthe qualifier “plausible” means, as advocates of the standard view\nunderstand it in different ways. For present purposes, we will\nsimply assume that a plausible rationale is one that epistemically and\nmorally competent peers will take seriously as a basis for supporting a\ncoercive law. Second, according to this formulation of the DRR, a\ncitizen can comply with the DRR even if he himself is not persuaded to\nsupport a coercive law for any secular reason. What matters is\nthat he believes that he has and can offer a secular rationale that his\nsecular cohorts can take seriously. \n\nSuppose, then, we have an adequate working conception of the DRR. The\nquestion naturally arises: Why do advocates of the standard view\nmaintain that we should conform to the DRR? For several reasons, most\nprominent of which are the following three arguments.  Of course,\nthere are many more arguments for the DRR than we can address here.\nSee, for example, Andrew Lister's appeal to the value of political\ncommunity (2013).  \n\nAdvocates of the standard view sometimes commend the DRR on the\ngrounds that conforming to it will help prevent religious warfare and\ncivil strife. According to Robert Audi, for example, “if\nreligious considerations are not appropriately balanced with secular\nones in matters of coercion, there is a special problem: a clash of\nGods vying for social control. Such uncompromising absolutes easily\nlead to destruction and death” (Audi 2000, 103). The concern\nexpressed here, presumably, is this: for all we reasonably believe,\ncitizens who are willing to coerce their compatriots for religious\nreasons will use their political power to advance their sectarian\nagenda—using the power of the state to persecute heretics,\nimpose orthodoxy, and enact stringent morals laws. In so doing, these\ncitizens will thereby provoke determined resistance and civil\nconflict. Such a state of affairs, however, threatens the very\nviability of a liberal democracy and, so, should be avoided at nearly\nall costs. Accordingly, religious believers should exercise restraint\nwhen deliberating about the implementation of coercive\nlaws. Exercising restraint, however, is best accomplished by adhering\nto the DRR. \n\nAccording to the liberal critics of the standard view, there are\nseveral problems with this argument. First, the liberal critics\ncontend, while there may have been a genuine threat of confessional\nwarfare in 17th century Western Europe, there is little\nreason to believe that there is any such threat in stable liberal\ndemocracies such as the United States. Why not? Because confessional\nconflict, the liberal critics continue, is typically rooted in\negregious violations of the right to religious freedom, when, for\nexample, people are jailed, tortured, or otherwise abused because of\ntheir religious commitments. John Locke puts the point thus:  If Locke is correct, then what we need to prevent confessional\nconflict is not compliance with a norm such as the DRR, but firm\ncommitment to the right to religious freedom. A stable liberal\ndemocracy such as the United States is, however, fully committed to\nprotecting the right to religious freedom—and will be for the\nforeseeable future. True enough, there are passionately felt\ndisagreements about how to interpret the right to religious freedom:\nwitness recent conflicts as to whether or not the right to religious\nfreedom should be understood to include the right of religious\nobjectors to be exempted from generally justified state policies (See\nKoppelman 2013; Leiter 2012). But it is difficult to see, the liberal\ncritics claim, that there is a realistic prospect of these\ndisagreements devolving into violent civil conflict. \n\n Second, even if there were a realistic prospect of religious\nconflict, liberal critics claim that it is unclear that adhering to\nthe DRR would lower the probability that such a conflict would\noccur. After all, the trigger for religious war—typically, the\nviolation of the right to religious freedom—is not always, or\neven typically, justified by exclusively religious considerations. As\nhistorian Michael Burleigh has argued, secularists have a long history\nof hostility to the right to religious freedom and, presumably, that\nhostility isn't at all grounded in religious considerations (Burleigh\n2007, 135 and, more generally, Burleigh 2005).  Third, the liberal critics maintain, when religious believers have\nemployed coercive power to violate the right to religious freedom,\nthey themselves rarely have done so in a way that violates the\nDRR. Typically, when such rights have been violated, the\njustifications offered, even by religious believers, appeal to alleged\nrequirements for social order, such as the need for uniformity of\nbelief on basic normative issues. One theological apologist for\nreligious repression, for example, writes this: “The king\npunishes heretics as enemies, as extremely wicked rebels, who endanger\nthe peace of the kingdom, which cannot be maintained without the unity\nof the faith. That is why they are burnt in Spain” (quoted in\nRivera, 1992, 50).  Ordinarily, the kind of religious persecution that\nengenders religious conflict is legitimated by appeal to secular\nreasons of the sort mandated by the DRR.  (This is the case even when\nreligious actors are the ones who appeal to those secular\nreasons.) \n\n Finally, liberal critics point out that\nsome religious believers affirm the right to religious freedom on\nreligious grounds; they take themselves to have powerful religious\nreason to affirm the right of each person to worship as she freely\nchooses, absent state coercion. So, for example, the\n4th century Nestorian Mar Aba: “I am a Christian. I\npreach my faith and want every man to join it. But I want him to\njoin it of his own free will. I use force on no man” (quoted in\nMoffett 1986, 216).\n [8]\nA believer such as Mar Aba might be\nwilling to violate the DRR; however, his violation would, according to\nthe liberal critics, help not to cause religious war but to impede\nit. For Mar Aba's 'sectarian rationale' supports not the violation of religious\nfreedom but its protection. \n\nIf the liberal critics are correct, one of the problems with the\nargument from warfare is that there is no realistic prospect of\nreligious warfare breaking out in a stable liberal democracy such as\nthe United States. Still, there may be other evils that are more\nlikely to occur under current conditions, which compliance with the\nDRR might help to prevent. For example, it is plausible to suppose\nthat the enactment of a coercive law that cannot be justified except\non religious grounds would engender much anger and frustration on the\npart of those coerced: “when legislation is expressly based on\nreligious arguments, the legislation takes on a religious character,\nto the frustration of those who don't share the relevant faith and who\ntherefore lack access to the normative predicate behind the law”\n(Greene 1993, 1060). This in turn breeds division between\ncitizens—anger and distrust between citizens who have to find\nsome amicable way to make collective decisions about common\nmatters. This counts in favor of the DRR precisely because compliance\nwith the DRR diminishes the likelihood of our suffering from such bad\nconsequences. \n\nTo this argument, liberal critics offer a three-part reply.  First,\nsuppose it is true that the implementation of coercive laws that can\nbe justified only on religious grounds often causes frustration and\nanger among both secular and religious citizens. The liberal critics\nmaintain that there is reason to believe that compliance with the DRR\nwould also engender frustration and anger among other religious and\nsecular citizens. To this end, they point to the fact that many\nreligious believers believe that conforming to the DRR would\ncompromise their loyalty to God: if they were prohibited from\nsupporting coercive laws for which they take there to be strong but\nexclusively religious reasons to support, they would naturally take\nthemselves to be prohibited from obeying God. But for many religious\nbelievers this is distressing; they take themselves to have overriding\nmoral and religious obligations to obey God. Similarly, some secular\ncitizens will likely be frustrated by the requirement that the DRR\nplaces on religious citizens. According to these secular citizens, all\ncitizens have the right to make political decisions as their\nconscience dictates. And, on some occasions, these secular citizens\nhold that exercising that right will lead religious citizens to\nviolate the DRR.[9] \n\nIf this is correct, for the argument from divisiveness to succeed, it\nwould have to provide reason to believe that the level of frustration\nand anger that would be produced by violating the DRR would be greater\nthan that of conforming to the DRR.  But, the liberal critics claim,\nit is doubtful that we have any such reason: in a very religious\nsociety such as the United States, it might be the case that\nrestrictions on the political practice of religious believers\nengenders at least as much frustration as the alternative. \n\n Second, the liberal critics argue,\nthere is reason to believe that conformance to the DRR would only\nmarginally alleviate the frustration that some citizens feel when\nconfronted with religious reasons in public political debate. The\nDRR, after all, does not forbid citizens from supporting coercive laws\non religious grounds, nor does it forbid citizens to articulate\nreligious arguments in public. Furthermore, complying with the\nDRR does not prevent religious citizens from advocating their favored\nlaws in bigoted, inflammatory, or obnoxious manners; it has\nnothing to say about political decorum. So, for example, because\nthe DRR doesn't forbid citizens from helping\nthemselves to inflammatory or demeaning rhetoric in political\nargument, the anger and resentment engendered by such rhetoric does\nnot constitute evidence for (or against) the DRR. \n\n Third, the liberal critics contend that\nbecause most of the laws that have a chance of enactment in a society\nas pluralistic as the United States will have both religious and\nsecular grounds, it will almost never be the case that any of the\nactual frustration caused by the public presence of religion supports\nthe DRR. Given that the DRR requires not a complete but only a\nlimited privatization of religious belief, very little of the\nfrustration and anger apparently engendered by the public presence of\nreligion counts in favor of the DRR. To which it is worth adding\nthe following point: advocates of the standard view could, with Rorty\n(1995), adopt a more demanding conception of the DRR that requires the\ncomplete privatization of religious belief. But, as many\nadvocates of the standard view itself maintain, it is doubtful that\nthis move improves the argument's prospects. The complete\nprivatization of religion is much more objectionable to religious\ncitizens and, thus, more likely to create social foment. (Rorty,\nit should be noted, softened his approach on this issue. See Rorty\n2003). \n\n There are no doubt other factors that need\nto be taken into consideration in the calculation required to formulate\nthe argument from divisiveness. But, the liberal critics\nmaintain, it is unclear how those disparate factors would add up.\nIn particular, if the liberal critics are correct, it is not clear\nwhether requiring citizens to obey the DRR would result in less overall\nfrustration, anger, and division than would not requiring them to do\nso. The issues at stake are empirical in character and the\nrelevant empirical facts are not known. \n\nThe third and most prominent argument for the DRR is the argument\nfrom respect. Here we focus on only one formulation of the\nargument, which has affinities with a version of the argument offered by\nCharles Larmore (see Larmore 1987).[10] \n\n The argument from respect runs as such: \n\nHowever, on the assumption that the antecedent to premise (4) is\ntrue—that there are cases in which the state must\ncoerce—it follows (given a few other assumptions) that: \n\nThat is, the DRR follows from a constraint on what makes for the moral\nlegitimacy of state coercion—viz., that a morally legitimate law\ncannot be such that there are those to whom it cannot be\njustified—and from the claim that citizens should not support\nany law that they realize lacks moral legitimacy. \n\n The argument from respect has received its\nfair share of criticism from liberal critics. Perhaps the most\ntroubling of these criticisms is that the argument undermines the\nlegitimacy of basic liberal commitments. To appreciate the thrust\nof this objection, focus for a moment on the notion being a\ncoercive law that is justified to an agent, to which the argument\nappeals. How should we understand this concept?\nOne natural suggestion is this: \n\nNow consider a coercive law that protects fundamental liberal\ncommitments, such as the right to exercise religious freedom. Is\nthis law justified to each citizen of a liberal democracy?\nLiberal critics answer: no. For there appear to be reasonable\ncitizens who have no good reason from their own perspective to affirm\nit. Consider, for example, a figure such as the Islamic\nintellectual Sayyid Qutb. While in prison, Qutb wrote an\nintelligent, informed, and morally serious commentary on the Koran in\nwhich he laid the ills of modern society at the feet of Christianity\nand liberal\n democracy.[11]\nThe only way to extricate ourselves\nfrom the problems spawned by liberal democracy, Qutb argued, is to\nimplement shariah or Islamic legal code, which implies that the state\nshould not protect a robust right to religious freedom. In short, Qutb \narticulates what is, from his point of view, a\ncompelling theological rationale against any law that authorizes the\nstate to protect a robust right to religious freedom. If respect\nfor persons requires that each coercive law be justified to those\nreasonable persons subject to that law, and if a person such as Qutb\nwere a citizen of a liberal democracy, then the argument from respect\nimplies that laws that protect the right to religious freedom are\nmorally illegitimate, as they lack moral justification—at least\nfor agents such as\n Qutb.[12]\nAnd for a defender of the standard\nview, this is certainly an unwelcome result. \n\n This kind of case leads liberal critics of\nthe standard view to deny the fourth premise of the argument from\nrespect. If they are correct, it is not the case that coercive\nlaws must be justified to those who must obey them (in the sense of\njustified to introduced earlier). Although having a\npersuasive justification would certainly be desirable and a significant\nmoral achievement, the liberal critics maintain that the moral\nlegitimacy of a law is not a function of whether it can be justified to\nall citizens—not even to all reasonable citizens. Some\ncitizens are simply not in a strong epistemic position to recognize\nthat certain coercive laws are morally legitimate. In such cases,\nliberal critics claim that we should do what we can to try to convince\nthese citizens that they have been misled. And we should\ncertainly do what we can to accommodate their concerns in ways that are\nconsistent with basic liberal commitments (see Swaine 2006). At\nthe end of the day, though, we may have no moral option but to coerce\nreasonable and epistemically competent peers whom we recognize have no\nreason from their perspective to recognize the legitimacy of the laws\nto which they are subject. However, if a coercive law can be\nmorally legitimate even though some citizens are not in a strong\nposition to recognize that it is, then (in principle) a coercive law\ncan be justified even if it requires a religious rationale. After\nall, if religious reasons can be adequate (a possibility that advocates\nof the standard view do not typically deny), then they are just the\nsort of reason that can be adequate without being recognized as such\neven by our morally serious and epistemically competent\npeers. \n\nIt should be conceded, however, that this objection to the argument\nfrom respect relies on a particular understanding of what it is for a\ncoercive law to be justified to an agent. Is there another account of\nthis concept that would aid the advocates of the standard view?\nPerhaps. Nearly all theorists have argued that a coercive law's being\njustified to an agent does not require that that agent actually have\nwhat he regards as an adequate reason to support it (see Gaus 1996,\nAudi 1997, and Vallier 2014).  “The question is not what people\ndo endorse but what people have reason to endorse” (Gaus 2010,\n23).  Better to understand the concept being a coercive law that\nis justified to an agent along the following lines: \n\nGiven this weaker, counterfactual construal of what makes for\nmorally permissible coercion, the argument from respect needn't\nundermine the legitimacy of the state's using coercion to protect basic\nliberal commitments. For we can always construe those\ncounterfactual conditions in such a way that those who in fact reject\nbasic liberal commitments would affirm them if they were more\nreasonable and better informed. In that case, using coercion to\nensure that they comply with basic liberal commitments would not be to\ndisrespect them. If this is correct, the prospect of there being\nfigures such as Qutb, who reject the right to religious freedom, need\nnot undermine the legitimacy of the state's coercive enforcement of\nthat basic liberal commitment. \n\n Liberal critics find this response\nunsatisfactory. After all, if this alternative construal of the\nargument is to succeed, it must be the case not only that: \n\nbut also: \n\nThese two claims, however, are highly controversial. Let us\nconsider the first. Were we to ask Qutb whether he would have\nreasons to support laws that protect a robust right to religious\nfreedom if he were adequately informed and reasonable, surely he would\nsay: no. Moreover, he would claim that his compatriots would\nreject the liberal protection of such a right if they were\nadequately informed about the divine authorship of the Quran and the\nproper rules of its interpretation. While Qutb's say-so doesn't\nsettle the issue of who would believe what in improved conditions,\nliberal critics maintain that his response indicates just how\ncomplicated the issue under consideration is. Among other things,\nto establish that Qutb is wrong it seems that one would have to deny\nthe truth of various theological claims on which Qutb relies when he\ndetermines that he would reject the right to religious freedom were he\nadequately informed and reasonable. That would require advocates\nof the standard view to take a stand on contested religious\nissues. However, liberal critics point out that defenders of the\nstandard view have been wary of explicitly denying the truth of\nreligious claims, especially those found within the major theistic\nreligions. \n\n Turn now to the second claim.\nSome liberal critics of the standard view, such as Nicholas\nWolterstorff, maintain that at the heart of liberal democracy is the\nclaim that some coercive laws function to protect inherent human\nrights. Wolterstorff further argues that attempts to ground these\nrights in merely secular considerations fail. Only by appeal to\nexplicitly theistic assumptions, Wolterstorff argues, can we locate an\nadequate justification for the ascription of these rights (see\nWolterstorff 2008, Pt. III as well as Perry 2003). What would\na reasonable and adequately informed secular citizen make of\nWolterstorff's arguments? Would he endorse them? \n\n It's difficult to say. Liberal\ncritics maintain that we are simply not in good epistemic position to\njudge the reasons an agent would have to support laws that protect\nbasic liberal commitments were he better informed and more\nreasonable. More exactly, liberal critics maintain that we are\nnot in a good epistemic position to determine whether a secular agent\nwho is reasonable and better informed would endorse or reject the type\nof theistic commitments that philosophers such as Wolterstorff claim\njustify the ascription of natural human rights. The problem is\nthat we don't really have any idea how radically a person would change\nhis views were he to occupy these conditions. The main, and still\nunresolved, question for this version of the standard view, then, is\nwhether there is some coherent and non-arbitrary construal of the\nrelevant counterfactual conditions that is strong enough to prohibit\nexclusive reliance on religious reasons but weak enough to allow for\nthe justification of basic liberal\ncommitments.  (See Vallier 2014 for the most recent and sophisticated\n attempt to specify those counterfactual conditions.) \n\nIn the last section, we considered three arguments for the DRR and\nresponses to them offered by the liberal critics. In the course of our\ndiscussion, we began to see elements of the view that liberal critics\nof the standard view—critics such as Christopher Eberle, Philip\nQuinn, Jeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff—endorse. To get\na better feel for why these theorists reject the\nDRR, it will be helpful to step back for a moment to consider some\nimportant features of their view. \n\n Earlier we indicated that liberal critics\nof the standard view offer detailed replies to both the Argument from\nReligious Warfare and the Argument from Divisiveness. Still,\nfriends of the standard view may worry that there is something deeply\nproblematic about these replies. For by allowing citizens to\nsupport coercive laws on purely religious grounds, they permit\nmajorities to impose their religious views on others and restrict the\nliberties of their fellow citizens. But it is important to see\nthat no liberal critic of the standard position adopts an “anything\ngoes” policy toward the justification of state coercion.\nCitizens, according to these thinkers, should adhere to several\nconstraints on the manner in which they support coercive laws,\nincluding the following. \n\n First, liberal critics of the\nstandard view assume that citizens should support basic liberal\ncommitments such as the rights to religious freedom, equality before\nthe law, and private property. Michael Perry argues, for example,\n“that the foundational moral commitment of liberal democracy is to the\ntrue and full humanity of every person—and therefore,\nto the inviolability of every person—without regard to\nrace, sex, religion… .” This commitment, Perry continues,\nis “the principal ground of liberal democracy's further commitment to\ncertain basic human freedoms” that are protected by law (Perry\n2003,\n 36).[13]\nMore generally, liberal critics maintain that citizens should support\nonly those coercive laws that they reasonably believe further the\ncommon good and are consistent with the demands of justice. These\ncommitments, they add, are not in tension with the claim that citizens\nmay support coercive laws that they believe to lack a plausible secular\nrationale. So long as a citizen is firmly committed to\nbasic liberal rights, she may coherently and without impropriety do so\neven though she regards these laws as having no plausible secular\njustification. More generally, liberal critics of the DRR\nmaintain that a citizen may rely on her religious convictions to\ndetermine which policies further the cause of justice and the common\ngood and may support coercive laws even if she regards them as having\nno plausible secular rationale. \n\n Second, liberal critics of the\nstandard view lay down constraints on the manner in which\ncitizens arrive at their political commitments (see Eberle 2002,\nWeithman 2002, and Wolterstorff 1997, 2012a). So, for example, each\ncitizen should abide by certain epistemic requirements: precisely\nbecause they ought not to support coercive laws that violate the\nrequirements of justice and the common good, citizens should take\nfeasible measures to determine whether the laws they support are\nactually just and good. In order to achieve that aim, citizens\nshould search for considerations relevant to the normative propriety of\ntheir favored laws, weigh those considerations judiciously, listen\ncarefully to the criticisms of those who reject their normative\ncommitments, and be willing to change their political commitments\nshould the balance of relevant considerations require them to do\nso. Again, liberal critics deny that even the most conscientious\nand assiduous adherence to such constraints precludes citizens from\nsupporting coercive laws that require a religious rationale. No\ndoubt, those who support coercive laws that require a religious\nrationale might do so in an insular, intransigent, irrational,\nor otherwise defective manner. But they\nneed not do so and, thus, their religiously-grounded support for\ncoercive laws need not be defective. \n\n Third, critics of the standard view\nneed have no aversion to secular justification and so need not object\nto a state of affairs in which each person, secular or religious, has\nwhat he or she regards as a compelling reason to endorse coercive laws\nof various sorts. (Indeed, they claim that such a state of\naffairs would arguably be a significant moral achievement—a\ngood for all concerned.) According to the liberal critics,\nhowever, what is most important is that parity reigns: any\nnormative constraint that applies to the reasons on the basis of which\ncitizens make political decisions must apply impartially to both\nreligious and secular reasons. Many secular reasons employed to\njustify coercion—ones that appeal to comprehensive perspectives\nsuch as utilitarianism and Kantianism, for example—are highly\ncontroversial; in this sense, they are very similar to religious\nreasons. For this reason, some advocate for a cousin —more or\nless distant, depending on the formulation—of the DRR, namely, one\nthat lays down restrictions on all religious reasons and on some\nparticularly controversial secular reasons. (See section 6 below.)\nMoreover, the normative issues implicated by certain coercive laws are\nso complex and contentious that any rationale for or against\nthese laws will include claims that can be reasonably\nrejected—secular or religious as the case might be. \n\n If this is right, according to the liberal\ncritics, equal treatment of religious and secular reasons is the order\nof the day: religious believers have no more, and no less, a\nresponsibility to aspire to persuade their secular compatriots by\nappeal to secular reasons than secularists have an obligation to aspire\nto persuade their religious compatriots by appeal to religious\nreasons. Otherwise put, according to the liberal critics, if we\naccept the claim that: \n\nwe should also accept: \n\nRecognizing parity of this sort, according to the liberal critics,\nlies at the heart of what it is to be a good citizen of a liberal\ndemocracy. For being a good citizen involves respecting one's\nfellow citizens, even when one disagrees with them. In a wide\nrange of cases, however, an agent exercises respect not by treating her\ninterlocutor as a generic human being or a generic citizen of a liberal\ndemocracy, but by treating her as a person who has a particular\nnarrative identity and life history, say, as an African American, a\nRussian immigrant, or a Muslim citizen. But doing this\noften requires pursuing and appealing to considerations that it is\nlikely that one's interlocutors with their own particular narrative\nidentity will find persuasive. And depending on the case, these\nreasons may be exclusively religious. \n\nTo this we should add a clarification: strictly speaking, the liberal\ncritics' insistence on parity between the pursuit of secular\nand religious reasons is consistent with the DRR. For, as we have\nconstrued it, the DRR allows that religious citizens may support\ncoercive laws for religious reasons (so long as they have and are\nprepared to provide a plausible secular justification for these\nlaws). And while its advocates do not typically emphasize the point,\nthe DRR permits secular citizens to articulate religious reasons that\nwill persuade religious believers to accept the secular citizens'\nfavored coercive laws (for reservations about this practice, see Audi\n1997, 135-37 on “leveraging reasons”.  See also\nSchwartzman 2014). Still, the DRR implies that there is an important\nasymmetry between the justificatory role played by religious and\nsecular reasons. To this issue we now turn. \n\nAssume that, in religiously pluralistic conditions, religious citizens\nhave good moral reason—perhaps even a moral obligation—to\npursue secular reasons for their favored coercive laws. Assume as well\nthat secular citizens have good reason to pursue religious reasons for\ntheir favored coercive policies (if only because, with respect to some\ncoercive laws, some of their fellow citizens find only religious\nreasons to support them). What should citizens do, religious or\nsecular, when they cannot identify these reasons? \n\n According to advocates of the standard\nview, if a religious citizen fails in his pursuit of secular reasons\nthat support a given coercive law, then he is morally required to\nexercise restraint. After all, if his pursuit of these reasons\nfails, then he does not have any secular reason to offer in favor of\nthat law. Liberal critics of the standard view, by contrast, deny\nthat citizens so circumstanced are morally required to exercise\nrestraint. They claim that from the fact that religious citizens\nare morally required to pursue secular reasons for their\nfavored coercive laws (when that is necessary for persuasion), it does\nnot follow that they should refrain from supporting coercive\nlaws if their pursuit of secular reasons fails. Because our\nhaving an obligation to try to bring about some state of affairs tells\nus nothing about what we ought to do if we cannot bring it about,\nnothing like the DRR follows from the claim that citizens should pursue\nsecular reasons for their favored coercive laws. According to the\nliberal critics, a parallel position applies to non-religious citizens:\nfrom the fact that non-religious citizens are morally required to\npursue religious reasons for their favored laws (when that is necessary\nfor persuasion), it doesn't follow that they should refrain from\nsupporting coercive laws if their pursuit of religious reasons\nfails. For the liberal critics, parity between the religious and\nthe secular obtains both with respect to the obligation to pursue\njustifying reasons and with respect to the permission not to exercise\nrestraint when that pursuit fails. \n\nHave we identified a genuine point of disagreement between the liberal\ncritics and advocates of the standard view? It seems so. If the\nliberal critics are correct, all that can be reasonably asked of\nreligious citizens is that, in a pluralistic liberal democracy, they\ncompetently pursue secular reasons for the coercive laws they\nsupport. If the pursuit fails, then they may support these laws for\nexclusively religious reasons. Proponents of the standard view\ndisagree, maintaining that if the pursuit fails, these citizens must\nexercise restraint. This disagreement is rooted in differing\nconvictions about the justificatory role that religious reasons can\nplay. Once again, advocates of the standard view maintain that\nreligious reasons can play only a limited justificatory role: citizens\nmust have and be prepared to offer (at least certain kinds of) secular\nreasons for any coercive law that they support, as religious reasons\nare not enough. The liberal critics deny this, maintaining that no\npersuasive arguments have been offered to believe this. The DRR\nhighlights this disagreement, as it incorporates an assumption that\nreligious and secular reasons play asymmetrical roles in justifying\ncoercive laws.[14] \n\nAs we have explicated the view of the liberal critics, religious\ncitizens are (in a wide range of cases) morally required to pursue\nsecular reasons for their favored coercive laws, but they needn't\nexercise restraint if they fail in their pursuit. But this position\nraises a question: What's so bad about requiring citizens to exercise\nrestraint? Why should liberal critics object to this? \n\n According to the liberal critics, one of\nthe core commitments of a liberal democracy is a commitment to\nreligious freedom and its natural extension, the right to freedom of\nconscience. When citizens use the modicum of political influence\nat their disposal, liberal critics claim that we should want them to do\nso in a way that furthers the cause of justice and the common\ngood. So, for example, when a citizen deliberates about whether\nhe should, say, support the invasion of Afghanistan by the United\nStates and its NATO allies, we want him to determine, as best he can,\nwhether the invasion of Afghanistan is actually morally\nappropriate. In order to determine that, he should be as\nconscientious as he can in his collection and evaluation of the\nrelevant evidence, reach whatever conclusions seem reasonable to him on\nthe available evidence, and act accordingly. If he concludes that\ninvading Afghanistan would be unjust, then he should oppose it.\nThat he does so is not only his right but also morally excellent, as\nacting in accord with responsibly held normative commitments is an\nimportant moral and civic good. \n\n This, the liberal critics maintain,\nsuggests a general claim. Whatever the policy and whatever the\nreasons—whether religious or secular—we have powerful\nreason to want citizens to support the coercive policies that they\nbelieve, in good conscience, to be morally appropriate. But that\ngeneral claim has direct application to the issue at hand. It is\npossible, the liberal critics claim, for a morally sensitive and\nepistemically competent citizen to regard only certain religious\nconsiderations as providing decisive support for a given coercive\nlaw. Nicholas Wolterstorff, to return to an earlier example,\nmaintains that only theistic considerations can ground the ascription\nof inherent human rights, some of which are protected by coercive\nlaw. Arguably, were a citizen to find a position such as\nWolterstorff's persuasive, then he should appeal to those\nconsiderations that he actually believes to further the cause of\njustice and the common good. And this should lead us to want him\nto support that law, even though he does so solely on religious\ngrounds, even if he regards that law as having no plausible secular\njustification. Good citizenship in a pluralistic liberal\ndemocracy unavoidably requires citizens to make political commitments\nthat they know their moral and epistemic peers reject but that they\nnevertheless believe, with due humility, to be morally required.\nThis ideal of good citizenship, so the liberal critics claim, applies\nto religious and secular citizens alike. \n\nThe portrait that we have offered of the standard view (and that of\nits liberal critics) is a composite, one which blends together various\nclaims that its advocates make about the relation between coercive law\nand religious reasons. Because of this approach we have made relatively\nlittle explicit mention of particular advocates of the standard view,\nsuch as that towering figure of contemporary political philosophy, John\nRawls. Of all the contemporary figures who have shaped the debate we\nare considering, however, none has exercised more influence than Rawls.\nIt is natural to wonder, then, whether we've presented the standard\nview in its most powerful form and, thus, whether we've omitted a\ncrucial dimension of the debate between the standard view and its\nliberal critics. We believe not. The version of the standard view that\nwe have considered is one that borrows liberally from Rawls' thought,\nalbeit softened and modified in certain ways. Still, before moving\nforward, it will be helpful to say something more about Rawls' view. We\nlimit ourselves to the following three observations. \n\nFirst, Rawls' own position about the relation between coercive law\nand religious reasons has shifted. In Political Liberalism,\nRawls admits that at one point he inclined toward accepting an\nambitious version of the DRR according to which each citizen of a\nliberal democracy ought not to appeal to religious reasons when\ndeliberating about matters of basic justice and constitutional\nessentials (see Rawls 1993, 247 n.36). In the face of criticism, Rawls\nmodified his position, arriving at a close relative of the DRR, viz.,\nthat while an agent may appeal to religious reasons to justify coercive\nlaw, he may not appeal solely to these reasons. Secular reasons must be\nforthcoming (see Rawls 1997).[15] \n\nSecond, Rawls places significant restrictions on the content of the\nsecular reasons to which an agent may appeal. To advert to a point made\nearlier, Rawls argues that when deliberating about matters of basic\njustice and constitutional essentials, citizens should appeal to\n“public reason,” which (roughly speaking) is a fund of\nshared principles about justice and the common good that is constructed\nfrom the shared political culture of a liberal\ndemocracy—principles that concern, for example, the equality of\ncitizens before the law and their right to a fair system of\ncooperation. In Rawls' view, when deliberating about these matters,\nappealing solely to secular comprehensive accounts of the good such as\nAristotelianism or utilitarianism is no more legitimate than appealing\nsolely to religious reasons. For all of these comprehensive doctrines\nwill be alien to some of one's reasonable compatriots. \n\nAs will have been evident, in our presentation of the DRR, we have\nrelaxed Rawls' stipulation, allowing for the legitimacy of appealing to\nonly secular reasons that have their home in one or another\ncomprehensive conception of the good. This might render the DRR\nvulnerable to the criticism that it invidiously and arbitrarily\ndiscriminates against religion.  But the Rawlsian 'public reason'\nalternative is also vulnerable to criticism.  It is not clear, for one\nthing, that the content of public reason will be rich enough to\nprovide compelling reasons to support genuinely informative positions\non matters of basic justice or constitutional essentials. Perhaps, for\nexample, the claims that belong to public reason are only fairly\nsweeping ones that ascribe basic rights of various sorts but offer no\nguidance about how they should be weighed (see Quinn 1997,\n149-52). Furthermore, it is unclear that appealing to public reason is\nthe best way to respect one's fellow citizens. Perhaps, as\nWolterstorff and Stout have argued, respect is better served both by\nexplicitly disclosing to one's interlocutors the reasons one finds\nmost persuasive (whatever they may be) and appealing to reasons that\nthey might most find most persuasive, given their own commitments to\none or another comprehensive perspective (see Wolterstorff 1997 and\nStout 2004, Chs. 2-4). \n\nIn fact, Wolterstorff has argued that, ironically, Rawls'\nmethodology has the implication that appealing to public reason would\nbe to treat others with profound disrespect. For note that when Rawls\nformulates his version of public reason, he claims that it will\nincorporate the idea that liberal democracy is a society with a system\nof fair cooperation over time. How do we identify such a system? Rawls\nmaintains that doing so requires that we set off to the side those who\nare “unreasonable” – these being those who are “unwilling to\nhonor, or even to propose … fair terms of cooperation” (Rawls\n1993, 51). But, as Wolterstorff contends, there are many who do not\nsatisfy Rawls' account of reasonability, including those who think of\npolitics not in terms of distributive justice but other categories such\nas preserving individual liberty, protecting small government,\nmaximizing their own wealth, and so on. The implication of setting\nthese people off to the side is that, when engaging in public political\ndeliberation about some issue of basic justice, the “reasonable”\ncitizens are free to ignore the views of their “unreasonable”\ncompatriots. This, however, raises the concern that far from advocating\na system in which all other citizens are respected as free and equal,\nRawls' view has the paradoxical implication that “to follow the duty of\ncivility is perforce to perpetrate injustice” by Rawls' own lights\n(Wolterstorff 2012, 121). \n\nThird, as Paul Weithman points out (in Weithman 2007), there are\nreally two types of argument that Rawls provides in favor of his\nposition. The first is a variant of the argument from respect. More\nspecifically, it is a relative to the first version of the argument\nfrom respect that we considered earlier, which maintains that coercive\nlaws are morally legitimate only if they can be justified to citizens\nof a liberal democracy with their actual commitments and beliefs. This\nargument, if the liberal critics are correct, is subject to some\nfairly powerful replies, among which is that, given the fact that\nthere is widespread pluralism about God and the good among the\ncitizens of liberal democracies, it is impossible for coercive laws\nthat protect basic liberal commitments to be justified to them. The\nsecond type of argument that Rawls provides in favor of his favored\nrestrictions on religious reasons, however, appeals not to the claim\nthat justifying coercion on the basis of alien reasons disrespects our\ncompatriots, but to the idea that the reasons on which we rely must be\nones that others can endorse as autonomous agents. In Kantian\ncategories, this second line of argument singles out not the evil of\nheteronomous considerations, but the goodness of considerations that\nautonomous and reasonable agents could accept as an appropriate basis\nfor settling fundamental political questions. \n\nIt is difficult to see, however, that this latter argument genuinely\nmoves beyond the argument from respect. The problem is that it is not\nevident that the content of what Rawls terms public reason is that to\nwhich reasonable and autonomous agents would primarily appeal when\nattempting to settle fundamental political questions. Once again, the\ncontent of public reason may be too thin to settle anything of\nimportance. Moreover, it is unclear that reasonable and autonomous\nagents would regard as inappropriate a democratic system in which\nagents bring to the table whatever reasons that seem best to them and\nvote solely on their basis. \n\nImagine, for example, a scenario in which citizens of a liberal\ndemocracy such as ours must deliberate on an issue of basic justice\nsuch as health care reform. One approach these citizens might take is\nRawls': they appeal primarily to public reason. Another approach is\nthat they try to forge a consensus about the issue that incorporates\nfeatures that belong to rather different comprehensive perspectives.\nAccording to this latter approach, Jews, Christians, Kantians,\nBuddhists, and Aristotelians all offer each other the reasons from\ntheir own comprehensive perspectives that seem to support health care\nreform, pointing out to each other the degree to which their reasons\noverlap. No public reasons are offered, only a plethora of\nparticularistic reasons each of which is reasonably rejected by some\ncitizens. Then the matter is put to a vote. Would an agent who is\nreasonable and autonomous reject this procedure in favor of appealing\nto public reason? According to the liberal critics, it is difficult to\nsee why we should believe he would. If so, the connection that Rawls\nattempts to forge between the exercise of autonomy and public reason is\ntoo tight. (In the next section, we discuss a version of\n‘public reason liberalism’ that incorporates the basic idea\nthat respect for persons is compatible with each citizen’s\noffering to one non-shared, non-public reasons for state coercion.) \n\nA final concern is worth airing. Figures such as Philip Quinn,\nJeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff interpret Rawls as addressing\nthe issue of how citizens in actual liberal democracies ought to\nconduct themselves when debating matters of justice and the common\ngood. But there is evidence that Rawls' texts ought not to be read in\nthis way. For, as Rawls indicates at various places, he takes himself\nto be discussing well-ordered societies. A well-ordered\nsociety is such that it contains no egoists, everyone complies with the\nprinciples of justice, everyone wants to participate in forms of social\nlife that call forth their own and others' natural talents, treachery\nand betrayal are absent, and its members want to cooperate with others\non terms that are mutually justifiable and affirm only reasonable\ncomprehensive doctrines (Weithman 2012, 65, 162, 169, 310). In short, a\nwell-ordered society is nothing like the actual world but is something\napproximating a political Utopia. \n\nSuppose Rawls were to establish that in a well-ordered society agents\nwould conform to his favored version of the restrictions on religious\nreasons. This would not imply that, in those circumstances in which we\nactually find ourselves, citizens should appeal to his version,\nthinking of it as a regulatory ideal in their political thinking. Not\nall ideals, after all, are worth pursuing. It might be, for example,\nthat pursuing the Rawlsian ideal would make it much more difficult for\ncitizens to employ other approaches to political deliberation that\nwould result in a liberal democracy being sufficiently stable for the\nright reasons, which, says Rawls, should be a primary objective of any\nliberal democracy. If this were correct, then Rawls's project would\nhave very modest implications for how to think about the relation\nbetween religion and public reason, since it would provide little or\nno guidance for how citizens ought to conduct their behavior (see\nCuneo 2013). \n\nLiberal critics of the standard view have not been free of their own\ncritics. We conclude this part of our discussion by articulating\none important response. \n\nAt the heart of the liberal critics’ conception of religion\nand public life is a commitment to parity between the religious and the\nsecular: because there are no morally, sociologically, or epistemically\nrelevant differences between religious and secular reasons, religious\nand secular reasons may play exactly the same role in a citizen’s\ndeliberations or decision-making regarding state coercion. This\nparity claim seems flatly inconsistent with the DRR – which\nsingles out religious reasons for special, discriminatory\ntreatment. But some theorists have argued that the parity claim,\nwhich is so important to the liberal critics, is in fact consistent\nwith a version of the DRR. An argument of this sort has been\narticulated by Gerald Gaus and Kevin Vallier (Gaus 2012, Gaus and\nVallier, 2009, Vallier, 2014).  \n\nGaus and Vallier's argument rests on two central claims. First,\nstate coercion is presumptively wrong; each and every coercive state\nenactment must be justified by each and every citizen subject to it. By\ncontrast, the lack of any state policy is not presumptively wrong, and\nso need not be justified – even to citizens whose well-being is\naffected by the lack of state activity. Second, the reasons by\nwhich state coercion is justified need not be shared by (or be\naccessible to) the citizens who are subject to a given coercive\nmeasure. What matters for purposes of the justification of coercion is\nthat each citizen has sufficient reason, as judged from his or her\nparticular perspective, to endorse state coercion. Since this view\nplaces no restrictions on the reasons to which an agent might appeal,\nreligious and secular reasons can play exactly the same justificatory\nrole, namely, to defeat what would, in the absence of contrary reasons,\nbe permissible acts of state coercion.  \n\nGaus and Vallier, then, have defended a convergence rather\nthan a consensus account of the standard view. If this\naccount is correct, state coercion must be justifiable to religious\ncitizens as religious believers and when it is not, then state\ncoercion lacks moral legitimacy. The same holds true for non-religious\ncitizens. Although the convergent conception of the standard view\naccords religious reasons a potentially decisive role in defeating\nstate coercion, and so accords religious reasons a much more prominent\nrole in the justification of state coercion than religious reasons have\non most alternative formulations of the standard view, it is also\nconsistent with the DRR. How so?  \n\nIn any liberal polity, there will inevitably be some secular\ncitizens. If there is nothing to be said from any secular\nperspective that decisively justifies some coercive measure, and if the\nonly plausible rationale for that coercive measure is a religious\nrationale, then there will inevitably be some citizens to whom that\ncoercive measure cannot be justified. According to the view under\nconsideration, such a coercive measure would be disrespectful and so\nillegitimate. So the convergent variation on the standard view\nmaintains the core conviction that religious considerations cannot\ndecisively justify state coercion in pluralistic liberal\npolitics. The implications for the duties of religious citizens\nseem direct: they ought to restrain themselves from supporting any act\nof state coercion that they know cannot be justified other than by\nreligious reasons. That is, they must comply with the DRR. If\nGaus and Vallier are correct, then, commitment to equal treatment of\nreligion is entirely consistent with a version of the DRR. (Gaus and\nVallier, it is worth noting, reject the DRR as an account of the duties\nof citizens, accepting only a milder version that applies to certain\npublic officials in certain circumstances.)  \n\nAlthough the convergent variation of the standard view will likely\nbe more attractive to liberal critics than familiar alternatives, they\nstill have reason to be skeptical. The convergent conception of the\nstandard view is, after all, demanding: state coercion must pass muster\nbefore the bar of religious and secular reasons. However, many citizens\nwill have compelling reasons to reject core liberal commitments. It\nfollows that, according to the convergence view, those liberal\ncommitments will lack justification. If so, liberal critics have reason\nto reject the convergent view, not because of its implications for\nreligion but for liberalism. Consider in this regard the case of Qtub\ntreated earlier. Qtub seems to have articulated compelling theological\nobjections to the right to religious freedom, and thus articulated\ncompelling theological reasons to deny that the state may coercively\nenforce that right. In this case, the state's enforcement of the right\nto religious freedom seems, according to the convergent conception, to\nlack legitimacy. \n\nTo this point, we have been primarily concerned to articulate the\nstandard view and lay out the response offered to it by its liberal\ncritics. We have emphasized that there are important differences\nbetween these two views. While not trivial, these differences should\nnot be exaggerated, however. Both views are deeply committed to the\ncore components of liberal democracy, including the protection of\nbasic freedoms such as the freedom to practice religion as one sees\nfit. Furthermore, both views recognize the legitimacy of religious\nreasons in political deliberation, noting the role of such reasons in\nimportant social movements such as the civil rights movement. The main\ndifference between advocates of the standard view and their liberal\ncritics, we've contended, is how they view the\njustificatory role of these reasons. That said, the liberal\ncritics are not the only or even the most influential critics of the\nstandard view. Indeed, if the central argument of Jeffrey Stout's\nbook Democracy and Tradition is correct, the standard view\nhas generated a worrisome backlash among prominent Christian\ntheologians and political theorists. These theologians and political\ntheorists, who Stout labels the New Traditionalists, reject\nnot only the standard view, but also liberal democracy as\nsuch—their assumption being that the standard view is a more or\nless inevitable outgrowth of liberal democracy. In spite of their\nfairly radical position, Stout contends that these thinkers need to be\ntaken seriously by the friends of democracy, as they exercise\nconsiderable influence in certain sectors of the academy and the\nculture at large. \n\n Suppose Stout is right to say that\nNew Traditionalists such as John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and\nStanley Hauerwas are widely influential in the academy and\nelsewhere. Should they be taken seriously by political\nphilosophers? That depends on what one understands the role of\npolitical philosophers to be. Suppose, however, we assume that\npolitical philosophers should be multidisciplinary in orientation,\nengaging with what sociologists, psychologists, and theologians write\nand say. If we assume this, then taking a multidisciplinary\napproach in this case seems to make sense. The topic under\nconsideration, after all, is the relation between religion and\npolitics, and theologians have had much to say about their\ninterrelations. Furthermore, while the approach that the New\nTraditionalists take to our topic is different from that taken by the\nadvocates of the standard view—the New Traditionalists tell a\nhistorical narrative about the ills of liberal democracy—the\nnarrative that they tell is a philosophical one. Indeed, it is a\nnarrative whose main lines will be familiar to most philosophers\nworking in ethics and political philosophy. It is natural to want\nto know whether this historical-philosophical narrative survives\nphilosophical scrutiny. We shall close, then, by considering the\nnarrative that the New Traditionalists tell about the emergence of\nmodern liberal democracies, highlighting the response offered to it by\nthe liberal critics. \n\nThose familiar with the work of Alasdair MacIntyre will immediately\nrecognize the New Traditionalists' narrative. For in its broad\nstructure, it bears a close resemblance to the one that MacIntyre tells\nin his three books After Virtue, Whose Justice? Which\nRationality? and Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry\n(MacIntyre 1984, 1988, and 1990,\n respectively).[16]\nThe MacIntyrean\nnarrative is broadly declinist in character, depicting the degeneration\nof Western moral and political thought in the following four\nstages. \n\n In the first stage, the New Traditionalists\nmaintain that the late ancient and the high medieval thinkers of the\nwest embraced a unified philosophical vision that includes three\nfundamental components. The first component is a commitment to a\n“thick” teleological account of the human good, according to which\nhuman beings have rational natures that can be perfected. The\nsecond component is a commitment to the claim that virtue consists in\nthe perfection of our rational nature in both its practical and\ntheoretical dimensions. Practical reason, according to the\nvision, can ascertain not merely the means to achieve one's ends, but\nalso the very telos or end for human beings. And theoretical\nreason, so the vision has it, can gain genuine insight into the world\nby viewing the entire created order as participating in or resembling\nthe divine nature. The third component of the vision is that\nmoral thought and discourse should be framed primarily in terms of the\nvirtues—the virtues providing the dominant conceptuality in\nterms of which we conduct moral reasoning. To which it is worth\nadding the following point: advocates of the MacIntyrean narrative do\nnot deny that pre-modern societies had their share of moral, religious,\nand political problems. Their claim is merely that these\nsocieties enjoyed (at least in principle) the shared conceptual\nresources with which they could coherently address and remedy\nthem. \n\n In the second stage of the narrative, there\nis a fall into our current fragmented moral and religious\ncondition. Although the New Traditionalists regard different\nmovements and figures as responsible for the fall, they agree on this\nmuch: the philosophical vision that unified the societies of\npre-modernity fell apart. The teleological worldview was replaced\nby a nominalist and mechanistic one. Practical reason became\ninstrumentalized—viewed as merely a “slave of the passions,” to\nuse Hume's phrase. And theoretical reason was conceived of as\nworking in a perfectly adequate fashion apart from any commitment to\nthere being a divinely-ordered reality. Furthermore, the language\nof justice and individual rights supplanted that of virtue. As a\nresult, the state that we now occupy is one in which we no longer enjoy\na shared conception of the good, and politics has become—to use\nMacIntyre's memorable phrase—“civil war by other means.”\nWithout such a conception of the good, we now face all manner of moral,\nreligious, and political problems that we lack the conceptual resources\nto resolve or even properly understand. \n\n In the third stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists maintain that liberal democracy emerges as the more or\nless natural political consequence of the fall from the pre-modern\nstate. Liberal democracy, according to the New Traditionalists,\nis not only a political structure that protects putative\nindividual rights (such as to religious freedom), but is also committed\nto a broad thesis of neutrality with respect to notions of God\nand the good. According to this understanding of liberal\ndemocracy, the state should not enact laws that require a religious\nrationale and citizens should therefore comply with the DRR.\nGiven its commitment to neutrality and the DRR, the New Traditionalists\nclaim that liberal democracy is a mode of governance that is\nfundamentally at odds with the type of traditional religious way of\nlife that informed society during its pre-modern state. \n\n In the final stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists offer proposals of various sorts for how traditionally\nreligious believers should cope with being citizens of a political\nsystem whose fundamental commitments are at odds with their own.\nThe proposals are generally not injunctions to transform the liberal\nstate. Rather, they are broadly separatist in nature, exhorting\ntraditional believers to distance themselves from the liberal state,\nsay, by living in small religious communities, which owe their ultimate\nallegiance to the church or some larger religious tradition. If\nthey are correct, the DRR is both crucial to liberal democracy and an\nimportant reason for traditional believers to reject it. \n\nThe MacIntyrean narrative is intriguing but highly\ncontroversial. Liberal critics have raised the following two\nobjections to it. \n\n The first feature of the narrative to which\nliberal critics have drawn attention is its highly intellectualized\ncharacter. If John Milbank and MacIntyre are correct, for\nexample, the fall into secularist liberalism is driven by the influence\nof some fairly abstract philosophical claims about the nature of reason\nand existence, which were defended by the medieval philosopher Duns\nScotus. By rejecting the broadly Augustinian/Thomistic picture of\nreason and existence, the New Traditionalists claim, Scotus paved the\nway for the rise of secularism, which is endemic to contemporary\nliberal democracies (see Milbank 1990 and MacIntyre 1990, Ch.\n7). \n\n Liberal critics maintain that, as a matter\nof intellectual history, this is not correct. Proponents of\nbroadly Scotistic or anti-theistic views, according to thinkers such as\nStout, never had the numbers or clout to change the world as\ndramatically as New Traditionalists claim. In fact, if Stout is\ncorrect, there is a counter-narrative to tell that is at least as\nplausible as the one that New Traditionalists champion. According\nto this counter-narrative, we should distinguish two types of\nsecularism: on the one hand, there is secularism as understood by the\nstandard view, which tells us that appeal to religious reasons in\npublic political discourse is insufficient to justify coercive\nlaws. On the other, there is broadly pluralistic secularism,\nwhich tells us merely that participants in public political discourse\nare not in a position to assume that their interlocutors are making the\nsame religious assumptions that they are. Stout maintains that\nliberal democracy is committed only to secularism of the second\nsort. Indeed, even critics of the standard view who affirm\nliberal democracy on religious grounds, such as Wolterstorff, grant\nthat liberal democracy is secular in Stout's second, pluralistic\nsense. Certainly, the liberal critics maintain, there is nothing\nabout liberalism that commits it to a version of secularism in which\nthe liberal state is an anti-Christian ecclesia or an alternate vehicle\nfor salvation, as some New Traditionalists have claimed (see, for\nexample, Milbank, et al. 1999, 192). \n\n Suppose that the liberal critics are\ncorrect in their contention that liberal democracy is committed only to\npluralistic secularism. Is this commitment the upshot of a broadly\nScotistic view about reason and existence having taken root in\nmodernity? If thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, the answer to this question is also: no. Rather, both\nStout and Wolterstorff suggest that liberal democracy's commitment to\nsecularism is the result of Christians themselves recognizing that\npost-Reformation Christianity itself had become so fragmented that\nChristians could no longer appeal to scripture and tradition in public\ndiscourse under the assumption that their interlocutors would share\ntheir views regarding scripture and tradition (see Zagorin\n2003). \n\n In support of this contention, Stout\nappeals to the historian Christopher Hill who maintains that in\n17th century English parliamentary politics, one\nincreasingly finds members of parliament appealing rather less to\nscripture when engaging in public political discourse and rather more\nto considerations upon which they and their interlocutors could\nagree. According to this counter-narrative, “secularization was\nnot primarily brought about by the triumph of a secularist\nideology….What drove the secularization of political discourse\nforward was the increasing need to cope with religious plurality\ndiscursively on a daily basis under circumstances where improved\ntransportation and communication were changing the political and\neconomic landscape” (Stout 2004, 102). To which Stout adds that\nsecularization (in the second, pluralistic sense specified earlier)\nthus understood doesn't morally or pragmatically preclude citizens from\nvoicing their religious convictions in the public square. Martin\nLuther King Jr.'s appeals to religious considerations, for example,\nwere highly politically effective. \n\n The first worry regarding the New\nTraditionalists' declinist narrative, then, is that it is overly\nintellectualized, portraying the rise of secularism as owing primarily\nto the influence of philosophical ideas and not to more mundane\nsociological facts, such as the need to cope with increasing religious\npluralism. The second worry about the narrative is that the New\nTraditionalists misdiagnose the character of liberal democracy,\nattributing to its advocates commitments that they needn't\naccept. To better understand this worry, recall the pattern of\nargument that the New Traditionalists employ, which is roughly the\nfollowing: \n\nWhat are some of the claims and practices that fit poorly with\northodox theism and to which liberalism is committed? If the New\nTraditionalists are correct, at least these two: first, liberalism\ntells us that political systems should be neutral regarding various\nnotions of God and the good; they should not operate with an account of\nan overriding good for human beings in whose light subsidiary goods can\nbe ordered. Second, liberalism is committed to the claim that\nmoral and political discourse should be couched not primarily in terms\nof the virtues, but individual rights. This, say the New\nTraditionalists has rendered liberal democracies a breeding ground for\ncitizens who are individualistic, self-focused, and whose views and\nbehavior are destructive of community. According to the New\nTraditionalists, these two claims are connected. It is because\nliberal democracies do not operate with a thick notion of the good that\nthe language of rights has supplanted that of virtue. For in\norder for the language of the virtues to be intelligible, it must be\ngrounded in a thick account of the good. \n\n When properly qualified, liberal critics\nsuch as Stout are willing to grant the first of these claims:\nliberalism does not in fact operate with a thick notion of the\ngood. But they reject the further claim that this has rendered\nappeal to the virtues in a liberal democracy irrelevant or somehow\ndeeply conceptually confused. For consider, Stout argues,\nchampions of liberalism within the broadly pragmatist tradition, such\nas Walt Whitman and John Dewey. These thinkers do not fit well\ninto the MacIntyrean paradigm. At their best, Stout maintains,\nWhitman and Dewey consciously theorize from the perspective of a\nbroadly pragmatic tradition that is committed to the centrality of the\nvirtues, albeit within a society characterized by competing and rival\nconceptions of God and the good. \n\n More specifically, Stout maintains that\naccording to pragmatist liberals such as Dewey, good citizens of a\nliberal democracy aspire to express not only civility and respect in\npublic political discourse, but also to accept some measure of\nresponsibility for the conditions of society and the political\narrangements it makes for itself. And to do this, citizens must\nreason with one another about the ethical issues that divide them and\nhold each other responsible, in ways that are decent and fair, for what\nis done and said. If the pragmatist liberals are right, reasoning\nof this sort requires that citizens of liberal democracies display\nvirtues of various sorts, such as openness to the views of others,\nproper respect for their positions, and so forth. In an inversion\nof the MacIntyrean position, Stout contends that it is at least in part\nbecause liberal democracies do not espouse some overarching, thick\nconception of the good that virtues such as civility and respect are\nespecially called for. And, particularly important for our\ndiscussion is Stout's further claim that pragmatism of this variety\nneedn't lend any support to the standard view. Expressing the\nvirtues of civility and respect is perfectly compatible with appealing\nonly to religious considerations when making and supporting political\ndecisions. \n\nSo, if the liberal critics are correct, one place to press the New\nTraditionalists' narrative is its claim that only within a thick,\noverarching account of the human good are the virtues\nintelligible. There is, however, a second place to press the\nnarrative, which is its skepticism about rights. As intimated\nearlier, MacIntyre and the New Traditionalists portray individual\nrights claims as both false and dangerous, indeed, as the upshot of an\nEnlightenment conception of morality that is inimical to a properly\nreligious way of life (see MacIntyre 1984 and 1983).\nMacIntyre, for example, writes that not only are rights claims on par\nwith belief in “witches and unicorns,” but also that: \n\nIn reply, the liberal critics make two points. First, as a\nmatter of historical fact, it is simply false that rights claims have\ntheir conceptual roots in the soil of late medieval nominalism and\nEnlightenment morality, as MacIntyre claims. Rather, as\nWolterstorff argues, appeals to rights are ubiquitous throughout\nhistory. One can find them, for example, in the ancient Romans\njuridical documents such as Justinian's Digest, the writings\nof the church fathers, and the work of the medieval canon\n lawyers.[17]\nIndeed,\naccording to Wolterstorff, appeals to what we call inherent or natural\nhuman rights can be traced back to the Hebrew and Christian scriptures\n(see Wolterstorff 2008, Pts. I-II). If Wolterstorff is correct,\nthe scriptural tradition not only birthed our conception of inherent\nhuman rights, but also provides the conceptual soil most conducive to\nits survival, for it offers the most cogent account of the worth of\nhuman beings. If this is true, according to Wolterstorff, there\nis no incompatibility between the liberal tradition's reliance on\nrights and a commitment to orthodox theism. To reject liberalism\nbecause it is committed to and relies heavily on the notion of rights\nwould be a mistake. \n\nSecond, the liberal critics contend that any connection between the\nappeals to rights in liberalism, on the one hand, and a tendency toward\nindividualism in its citizens, on the other, is highly\ncontingent. Perhaps it is true that contemporary liberal\ndemocracies have in fact had a strong tendency to promote\nindividualism, where this is understood as a person's having a\ndistorted focus on her rights to the exclusion of her\nobligations and responsibilities to others. But if we construe a\nliberal democracy minimally, as a political structure that effectively\nprotects a certain schedule of individual rights (to religious freedom,\nspeech, due process, and the like), it is plausible to suppose that\nexclusive focus on individual rights is itself a betrayal of\nliberalism. After all, claim-rights almost always have\ncorrelative obligations: if you have a right to religious\nfreedom, then I have an obligation not to violate that\nright. Furthermore, I also have an obligation to take feasible\nmeasures to support political institutions that protect that\nright. Any understanding of a liberal democracy according to\nwhich citizens may insist on their rights without due regard for the\nobligations they bear to others and social institutions that protect\nthese rights is arguably both incoherent and a betrayal of basic\nliberal commitments. Thinkers such as Wolterstorff add that for\ntheists who affirm liberal democracy, it is natural to suppose that\ncitizens who ignore their obligations to respect the rights of their\ncompatriots thereby also violate God's rights. For,\naccording to these thinkers, God has a right to be obeyed, and God\ndemands that we respect the worth of each human being. If the\nliberal critics are correct, then, any individualism that attends\nliberal democracy is a corruption. Perhaps it is a corruption to\nwhich liberal democracies are prone; but individualism is neither a\nliberal commitment nor, if thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, an inevitable manifestation of liberal commitments. \n\n The liberal critics, then, are highly\nsuspicious of the New Traditionalists' narrative and the philosophical\nlessons they glean from it. But suppose, for argument's sake,\nthat the narrative is largely compelling. Even if it is\ncompelling, the liberal critics insist that the New Traditionalists\nhave ignored an important option, viz., a minimalist account of liberal\ndemocracy. According to this position, liberalism is committed to\nthe following pair of theses. First, the state is to be neutral\nwith respect to different conceptions of the good. The neutrality\nin question, however, is inclusive in nature. It does not rule\nout the appeal to comprehensive conceptions of the good when making\nfundamental political decisions. Rather, it only rules out the\nclaim that the state is committed to promoting one such\nconception. Second, the state is to protect a schedule of basic\nrights and liberties enjoyed by all its citizens. Its role is to\nensure that its citizens can enjoy such goods as freedom of religion,\nfreedom of conscience, and equality before the law. \n\n The liberal critics maintain that a view\nsuch as this deserves serious consideration by both defenders of the\nstandard view and orthodox religious believers. The challenge\nthat liberal critics such as Stout and Wolterstorff pose to New\nTraditionalists in particular is this: Given that moral and religious\npluralism are here to stay, why would Christians and other people of\nfaith want to reject minimal liberal democracy—liberal\ndemocracy shorn of its commitment to the standard view? What\nmorally feasible alternative is there to a political order in which the\nstate employs its coercive powers to protect the rights of each of its\ncitizens? \n\n Proponents of the New Traditionalism\nfind this attempt on the part of the liberal critics to marry liberal\ndemocracy with traditional religious belief naïve. If they\nare right, any political system that professes neutrality with respect\nto conceptions of God and the good is unacceptable. At best, it\nwill be inhospitable soil for a genuinely virtuous and religious way of\nlife. At worst, any such system will be an attempt to conceal the\nfact that the deep structure of liberal democracy, with its emphasis on\npersonal freedoms and procedural justice, fits poorly with the thick\naccount of the good that orthodox religious believers endorse.\nAccording to these thinkers, the conflict between liberal democracy and\ntraditional religion runs too deep for appeals to minimalist accounts\nof liberalism to be effective. \n\nThe theologico-political problem is one that concerns the problem of\npolitical authority. In its contemporary form, it primarily\nconcerns the justification of authoritative political acts, such as the\nimplementation of coercive laws. Can religious reasons justify\nthe implementation of such laws? This is the central question\nwith which political philosophers have been concerned. The\nstandard view tells us that religious reasons are never sufficient to\njustify coercive law. It therefore champions the DRR, or the\nclaim that, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she\nshould support some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for it, then it is impermissible for her to\nsupport that law. The main responses to the standard view divides\ninto two types. Liberal critics of the view hold fast to the\nprinciples of liberal democracy but reject the DRR—in part for\nthe reason that the DRR is illiberal. New Traditionalists, by\ncontrast, reject both liberal democracy itself and the DRR, viewing the\nlatter as more or less a component of the former. (On this latter\npoint, they agree with advocates of the standard view.) \n\n Is there likely to be any sort of\nrapprochement between these views? It is difficult to know.\nSometimes, however, positions that occupy the conceptual middle-ground\nin a debate are the best candidates for unifying what can appear to be\nirreconcilable positions. In the case at hand, the liberal\ncritics appear to occupy this conceptual middle-ground, straddling the\nstandard view and the New Traditionalism. On the one hand, the\nliberal critics find themselves sympathetic with the political\ncommitments of the standard view but not with the wariness about\nreligion that often animates this position. On the other hand,\nthe liberal critics find themselves sympathetic with some of the\nreligious commitments embraced by the New Traditionalists but not with\ntheir suspicion of liberal democracy. Nevertheless, the liberal\ncritics are vulnerable to criticisms from both sides. Advocates\nof the standard view will charge that they do not take seriously enough\nthe destructive and divisive effects of religion, hard to quantify as\nthey might be. And friends of the New Traditionalism will\nmaintain that they fail to recognize the corrosive effects of liberal\ndemocracy on traditional religious ways of life. These are\nimportant criticisms, married to passions that deeply divide the\nproponents of these views. Still, members of all parties to the\ndebate agree that the task at hand is to articulate ways in which\ncitizens of a deeply pluralistic liberal democracy can conduct their\nbehavior in manners that are not only faithful to whatever religious\nidentities they may have, but are also just and contribute to the\ncommon good.","contact.mail":"eberle@usna.edu","contact.domain":"usna.edu"},{"date.published":"2008-10-02","date.changed":"2015-01-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-politics/","author1":"Chris Eberle","author1.info":"http://www.uvm.edu/~phildept/?Page=Cuneo.php","entry":"religion-politics","body.text":"\n\n\n\nWhen the well-known political theorist Leo Strauss introduced the\ntopic of politics and religion in his reflections, he presented it as a\nproblem—the “theologico-political problem” he called\nit (Strauss\n 1997).[1]\nThe problem, says Strauss, is primarily\none about authority: Is political authority to be grounded in the\nclaims of revelation or reason, Jerusalem or Athens? In so\ncharacterizing the problem, Strauss was tapping into currents of\nthought deep in the history of political reflection in the west, ones\nabout the nature, extent, and justification of political\nauthority. Do monarchies owe their authority to divine\nright? Has God delegated to secular rulers such as kings and\nemperors the authority to wage war in order to achieve religious\naims: the conversion of the infidel or the repulsion of unjust attacks\non the true faith? Do secular rulers have the authority to suppress\nheretics? What authority does the state retain when its principles\nconflict with God's? Is the authority of the natural law ultimately\ngrounded in divine law? These and other questions animated much of the\ndiscussion among medieval and modern philosophers alike.\n\n\n\nWith the emergence of liberal democracy in the modern west, however,\nthe types of questions that philosophers asked about the interrelation\nbetween religion and political authority began to shift, in large\nmeasure because the following three-fold dynamic was at work. In the\nfirst place, divine-authorization accounts of political authority had\nlost the day to consent-based approaches. Political authority in a\nliberal democracy, most prominent defenders of liberal democracy\nclaimed, is grounded in the consent of the people to be ruled rather\nthan in God's act of authorization. Second, the effects of the\nProtestant Reformation had made themselves felt acutely, as the\nbroadly homogeneous religious character of Western Europe\ndisintegrated into competing religious communities. The population of\nWestern Europe and the United States were now not only considerably\nmore religiously diverse, but also deeply wary of the sort of\nbloodshed occasioned by the so-called religious wars. And, finally,\nsecularization had begun to take hold. Both the effects of religious\ndiversity and prominent attacks on the legitimacy of religious belief\nensured that one could no longer assume in political discussion that\none's fellow citizens were religious, let alone members of one's own\nreligious tradition.\n\n\n\n For citizens of contemporary liberal\ndemocracies, this three-fold dynamic has yielded a curious\nsituation. On the one hand, most take it for granted that the\nauthority of the state is located in the people, that the people are\nreligiously diverse, and that important segments of people doubt the\nrationality of religious belief and practice of any sort. On the\nother hand, contrary to the predictions of many advocates of\nsecularization theory, such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, and (at one time)\nPeter Berger, this mix of democracy, religious diversity, and religious\ncriticism has not resulted in the disappearance or privatization of\nreligion. Religion, especially in liberal democracies such as the\nUnited States, is alive and well, shaping political culture in numerous\nways. Consequently, there very much remains a\ntheologico-political problem. The problem, moreover, still\nconcerns political authority, though now reframed by the transition to\nliberal democracy. If recent reflection on the issue is any\nguide, the most pressing problem to address is this: Given that\nstate-authorized coercion needs to be justified, and that the\njustification of state coercion requires the consent of the people,\nwhat role may religious reasons play in justifying state\ncoercion? More specifically, in a religiously pluralistic context\nsuch as one finds in contemporary liberal democracies, are religious\nreasons sufficient to justify a coercive law for which reasonable\nagents cannot find an adequate secular rationale?\n\n\n\n This article considers the most important\nanswers to these questions offered by recent philosophers, political\ntheorists, and theologians. We present these answers as part of a\nlively three-way discussion between advocates of what we call the\nstandard view, their liberal critics, and proponents of the so-called\nNew Traditionalism. Briefly stated, advocates of the standard\nview argue that in contemporary liberal democracies, significant\nrestraints must be put on the political role of religious\nreasons. Their liberal critics deny this, or at least deny that\ngood reasons have been given to believe this. New\nTraditionalists, by contrast, turn their back on both the standard view\nand its liberal critics, arguing that religious orthodoxy and liberal\ndemocracy are fundamentally incompatible. To have a grip on this\nthree-way debate, we suggest, is to understand that dimension of the\ntheologico-political problem that most animates philosophical\nreflection in liberal democracies on the relation between religion and\npolitics.\n\n\n\nThe standard view among political theorists, such as Robert Audi,\nJürgen Habermas, Charles Larmore, Steven Macedo, Martha Nussbaum,\nand John Rawls is that religious reasons can play only a limited role\nin justifying coercive laws, as coercive laws that require a religious\nrationale lack moral\n legitimacy.[2]\nIf the standard view is correct, there is\nan important asymmetry between religious and secular reasons in the\nfollowing respect: some secular reasons can themselves justify state\ncoercion but no religious reason can. This asymmetry between the\njustificatory potential of religious and secular reasons, it is further\nclaimed, should shape the political practice of religious\nbelievers. According to advocates of the standard view, citizens\nshould not support coercive laws for which they believe there is no\nplausible secular rationale, although they may support coercive laws\nfor which they believe there is only a secular rationale. (Note \nthat not just any secular rationale counts.)  We can refer\nto this injunction to exercise restraint as The Doctrine of\nReligious Restraint (or the DRR, for\n short).[3]\nThis abstract\ncharacterization of the DRR will require some refinements, which we'll\nprovide in sections 2 and 3. For the time being, however, we can\nget a better feel for the character of the DRR by considering the\nfollowing case. \n\nRick is a politically engaged citizen who intends to vote in a\nreferendum on a measure that would criminalize homosexual\nrelations. As he evaluates the relevant considerations, he concludes\nthat the only persuasive rationale for that measure includes as a\ncrucial premise the claim that homosexual relations are contrary to a\nGod-established natural order. Although he finds that rationale\ncompelling, he realizes that many others do not. But because he takes\nhimself to have a general moral obligation to make those political\ndecisions that, as best he can tell, are both just and good, he\ndecides to vote in favor of criminalization. Moreover, he tries to\npersuade his compatriots to vote with him. In so doing, he offers\nrelevantly different arguments to different audiences. He tries to\nconvince like-minded citizens by appealing to the theistic natural law\nargument that he finds persuasive.  But he realizes that many of his\nfellow citizens are unpersuaded by the natural law argument that\nconvinces him. So he articulates a variety of other\narguments—some secular, some religious—that he hopes will\nleverage those who don't share his natural law theism into supporting\nhis position. He does so even though he doubts that any of those\nleveraging arguments are cogent, realizes that many of those to whom\nhe addresses them will have comparable doubts about their cogency, and\nso believes that many coerced by the law he supports have no good\nreason, from their perspective, to affirm that law. \n\n Advocates of the standard view will\nbe troubled by Rick's behavior. The relevantly troubling feature\nof Rick's behavior is not primarily his decision to support this\nparticular policy. Rather, it is his decision to support a policy\nthat he believes others have no good reason, from their perspective, to\nendorse. After all, Rick votes to enact a law that authorizes state coercion even\nthough he believes that the only plausible rationale for that decision\nincludes religious claims that many of his compatriots find utterly\nunpersuasive. In so doing, Rick violates a normative constraint\nat the heart of the standard view, viz., that citizens in a pluralistic\nliberal democracy ought to refrain from using their political influence\nto authorize coercive laws that, to the best of their knowledge, can be\njustified only on religious grounds and so lack a plausible\nsecular\n rationale.[4]\nOr, otherwise put, Rick violates the DRR. For the DRR tells us\nthat, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she should\nsupport some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for that law, then she may not support\nit. \n\n The DRR is a negative constraint; it\nidentifies a kind of reason that cannot itself justify a coercive law\nand so a kind of reason on which citizens may not exclusively rely when\nsupporting a coercive law. But this negative constraint is typically conjoined with a\npermission: although citizens may not support coercive laws for which\nthey believe themselves to have only a religious rationale, they may\nsupport coercive laws for which they believe there is only a plausible\nsecular rationale. As we'll see in a moment, advocates of the DRR\nfurnish reasons to believe that religious and secular reasons have this\nasymmetrical justificatory role. \n\nThe standard view has often been misunderstood, typically by\nassociating the DRR with claims its advocates are free to deny.\nIt will therefore be helpful to dissociate the DRR from various common\nmisunderstandings. \n\n First, the DRR is a moral constraint,\none that applies to people in virtue of the fact that they are citizens\nof a liberal democracy. As such, it need not be encoded into law,\nenforced by state coercion or social stigma, promoted in state\neducational institutions, or in any other way policed by the powers\nthat be. Of course, advocates of restraint are free to argue that\nthe state should police violations of the DRR (see Habermas 2006,\n 10).[5]\nPerhaps some liberal democracies do police something like the\nDRR. But advocates of the standard view needn't endorse\nrestrictions of this\n sort.[6] \n\n Second, the DRR does not\nrequire a thorough-going privatization of religious commitment.\nIndeed, the DRR permits religious considerations to\nplay a rather prominent role in a citizen's political practice:\ncitizens are permitted to vote for their favored coercive policies on\nexclusively religious grounds as well as to advocate publicly for those\npolicies on religious grounds. What the DRR does require of\ncitizens is that they reasonably believe that they have some plausible\nsecular rationale for each of the coercive laws that they support,\nwhich they are prepared to offer in political discussion.\nIn this respect, the present construal of the DRR is weaker than comparable\nproposals, such as that developed by Robert Audi, which requires that\neach citizen have and be motivated by some evidentially adequate\nsecular rationale for each of the coercive laws he or she supports (see\nAudi 1997, 138 and Rawls 1997, 784ff). \n\n Third, the DRR places few restrictions on\nthe content of the secular reasons to which citizens can appeal when\nsupporting coercive laws. Although the required secular reasons\nmust be “plausible” (more on this in a moment), they \nmay make essential reference to what Rawls\ncalls “comprehensive conceptions of the good,” such as Platonism,\nKantianism, or\n utilitarianism.[7]\nAccordingly, the standard view does not\ncommit itself to a position according to which secular reasons must be\nincluded or otherwise grounded in a neutral source—a set of\nprinciples regarding justice and the common good such that everybody\nhas good reason, apart from his own or any other religious or\nphilosophical perspective, to find acceptable. Somewhat more\nspecifically, advocates of the standard view needn't claim that\nsecular reasons must be found in what Rawls calls “public\nreason,” which (roughly speaking) is a fund of shared principles\nabout justice and the common good constructed from the shared\npolitical culture of a liberal democracy. That having been said, it is\nworth stressing that some prominent advocates of the standard view\nadopt a broadly Rawlsian account of the DRR, according to which\ncoercive laws must be justified by appeal to public reason (see\nGutmann and Thompson 1996, Larmore 1987, Macedo 1990, and\nNussbaum 2008). We shall have more to say about this view in section\n6. \n\n Fourth, the DRR itself has no determinate\npolicy implications; it is a constraint not on legislation itself, but\non the configuration of reasons to which agents may appeal when\nsupporting coercive legislation. So, for example, it forbids Rick\nto support the criminalization of homosexuality when he believes that\nthere are no plausible secular reasons to criminalize it. As\nsuch, the moral propriety of the DRR has nothing directly to do with\nits usefulness in furthering, or discouraging, particular policy\naims. \n\n The DRR, then, is a norm that is\nsupposed to provide guidance for how citizens of a liberal democracy\nshould conduct themselves when deliberating about or deciding on the implementation of\ncoercive laws. For our purposes, it will be helpful to work with\na canonical formulation of it. Let us, then, formulate the DRR as\nfollows: \n\nAbout this formulation of the DRR, let us make two points.\nFirst, in what follows, we will remain largely noncommittal about what\nthe qualifier “plausible” means, as advocates of the standard view\nunderstand it in different ways. For present purposes, we will\nsimply assume that a plausible rationale is one that epistemically and\nmorally competent peers will take seriously as a basis for supporting a\ncoercive law. Second, according to this formulation of the DRR, a\ncitizen can comply with the DRR even if he himself is not persuaded to\nsupport a coercive law for any secular reason. What matters is\nthat he believes that he has and can offer a secular rationale that his\nsecular cohorts can take seriously. \n\nSuppose, then, we have an adequate working conception of the DRR. The\nquestion naturally arises: Why do advocates of the standard view\nmaintain that we should conform to the DRR? For several reasons, most\nprominent of which are the following three arguments.  Of course,\nthere are many more arguments for the DRR than we can address here.\nSee, for example, Andrew Lister's appeal to the value of political\ncommunity (2013).  \n\nAdvocates of the standard view sometimes commend the DRR on the\ngrounds that conforming to it will help prevent religious warfare and\ncivil strife. According to Robert Audi, for example, “if\nreligious considerations are not appropriately balanced with secular\nones in matters of coercion, there is a special problem: a clash of\nGods vying for social control. Such uncompromising absolutes easily\nlead to destruction and death” (Audi 2000, 103). The concern\nexpressed here, presumably, is this: for all we reasonably believe,\ncitizens who are willing to coerce their compatriots for religious\nreasons will use their political power to advance their sectarian\nagenda—using the power of the state to persecute heretics,\nimpose orthodoxy, and enact stringent morals laws. In so doing, these\ncitizens will thereby provoke determined resistance and civil\nconflict. Such a state of affairs, however, threatens the very\nviability of a liberal democracy and, so, should be avoided at nearly\nall costs. Accordingly, religious believers should exercise restraint\nwhen deliberating about the implementation of coercive\nlaws. Exercising restraint, however, is best accomplished by adhering\nto the DRR. \n\nAccording to the liberal critics of the standard view, there are\nseveral problems with this argument. First, the liberal critics\ncontend, while there may have been a genuine threat of confessional\nwarfare in 17th century Western Europe, there is little\nreason to believe that there is any such threat in stable liberal\ndemocracies such as the United States. Why not? Because confessional\nconflict, the liberal critics continue, is typically rooted in\negregious violations of the right to religious freedom, when, for\nexample, people are jailed, tortured, or otherwise abused because of\ntheir religious commitments. John Locke puts the point thus:  If Locke is correct, then what we need to prevent confessional\nconflict is not compliance with a norm such as the DRR, but firm\ncommitment to the right to religious freedom. A stable liberal\ndemocracy such as the United States is, however, fully committed to\nprotecting the right to religious freedom—and will be for the\nforeseeable future. True enough, there are passionately felt\ndisagreements about how to interpret the right to religious freedom:\nwitness recent conflicts as to whether or not the right to religious\nfreedom should be understood to include the right of religious\nobjectors to be exempted from generally justified state policies (See\nKoppelman 2013; Leiter 2012). But it is difficult to see, the liberal\ncritics claim, that there is a realistic prospect of these\ndisagreements devolving into violent civil conflict. \n\n Second, even if there were a realistic prospect of religious\nconflict, liberal critics claim that it is unclear that adhering to\nthe DRR would lower the probability that such a conflict would\noccur. After all, the trigger for religious war—typically, the\nviolation of the right to religious freedom—is not always, or\neven typically, justified by exclusively religious considerations. As\nhistorian Michael Burleigh has argued, secularists have a long history\nof hostility to the right to religious freedom and, presumably, that\nhostility isn't at all grounded in religious considerations (Burleigh\n2007, 135 and, more generally, Burleigh 2005).  Third, the liberal critics maintain, when religious believers have\nemployed coercive power to violate the right to religious freedom,\nthey themselves rarely have done so in a way that violates the\nDRR. Typically, when such rights have been violated, the\njustifications offered, even by religious believers, appeal to alleged\nrequirements for social order, such as the need for uniformity of\nbelief on basic normative issues. One theological apologist for\nreligious repression, for example, writes this: “The king\npunishes heretics as enemies, as extremely wicked rebels, who endanger\nthe peace of the kingdom, which cannot be maintained without the unity\nof the faith. That is why they are burnt in Spain” (quoted in\nRivera, 1992, 50).  Ordinarily, the kind of religious persecution that\nengenders religious conflict is legitimated by appeal to secular\nreasons of the sort mandated by the DRR.  (This is the case even when\nreligious actors are the ones who appeal to those secular\nreasons.) \n\n Finally, liberal critics point out that\nsome religious believers affirm the right to religious freedom on\nreligious grounds; they take themselves to have powerful religious\nreason to affirm the right of each person to worship as she freely\nchooses, absent state coercion. So, for example, the\n4th century Nestorian Mar Aba: “I am a Christian. I\npreach my faith and want every man to join it. But I want him to\njoin it of his own free will. I use force on no man” (quoted in\nMoffett 1986, 216).\n [8]\nA believer such as Mar Aba might be\nwilling to violate the DRR; however, his violation would, according to\nthe liberal critics, help not to cause religious war but to impede\nit. For Mar Aba's 'sectarian rationale' supports not the violation of religious\nfreedom but its protection. \n\nIf the liberal critics are correct, one of the problems with the\nargument from warfare is that there is no realistic prospect of\nreligious warfare breaking out in a stable liberal democracy such as\nthe United States. Still, there may be other evils that are more\nlikely to occur under current conditions, which compliance with the\nDRR might help to prevent. For example, it is plausible to suppose\nthat the enactment of a coercive law that cannot be justified except\non religious grounds would engender much anger and frustration on the\npart of those coerced: “when legislation is expressly based on\nreligious arguments, the legislation takes on a religious character,\nto the frustration of those who don't share the relevant faith and who\ntherefore lack access to the normative predicate behind the law”\n(Greene 1993, 1060). This in turn breeds division between\ncitizens—anger and distrust between citizens who have to find\nsome amicable way to make collective decisions about common\nmatters. This counts in favor of the DRR precisely because compliance\nwith the DRR diminishes the likelihood of our suffering from such bad\nconsequences. \n\nTo this argument, liberal critics offer a three-part reply.  First,\nsuppose it is true that the implementation of coercive laws that can\nbe justified only on religious grounds often causes frustration and\nanger among both secular and religious citizens. The liberal critics\nmaintain that there is reason to believe that compliance with the DRR\nwould also engender frustration and anger among other religious and\nsecular citizens. To this end, they point to the fact that many\nreligious believers believe that conforming to the DRR would\ncompromise their loyalty to God: if they were prohibited from\nsupporting coercive laws for which they take there to be strong but\nexclusively religious reasons to support, they would naturally take\nthemselves to be prohibited from obeying God. But for many religious\nbelievers this is distressing; they take themselves to have overriding\nmoral and religious obligations to obey God. Similarly, some secular\ncitizens will likely be frustrated by the requirement that the DRR\nplaces on religious citizens. According to these secular citizens, all\ncitizens have the right to make political decisions as their\nconscience dictates. And, on some occasions, these secular citizens\nhold that exercising that right will lead religious citizens to\nviolate the DRR.[9] \n\nIf this is correct, for the argument from divisiveness to succeed, it\nwould have to provide reason to believe that the level of frustration\nand anger that would be produced by violating the DRR would be greater\nthan that of conforming to the DRR.  But, the liberal critics claim,\nit is doubtful that we have any such reason: in a very religious\nsociety such as the United States, it might be the case that\nrestrictions on the political practice of religious believers\nengenders at least as much frustration as the alternative. \n\n Second, the liberal critics argue,\nthere is reason to believe that conformance to the DRR would only\nmarginally alleviate the frustration that some citizens feel when\nconfronted with religious reasons in public political debate. The\nDRR, after all, does not forbid citizens from supporting coercive laws\non religious grounds, nor does it forbid citizens to articulate\nreligious arguments in public. Furthermore, complying with the\nDRR does not prevent religious citizens from advocating their favored\nlaws in bigoted, inflammatory, or obnoxious manners; it has\nnothing to say about political decorum. So, for example, because\nthe DRR doesn't forbid citizens from helping\nthemselves to inflammatory or demeaning rhetoric in political\nargument, the anger and resentment engendered by such rhetoric does\nnot constitute evidence for (or against) the DRR. \n\n Third, the liberal critics contend that\nbecause most of the laws that have a chance of enactment in a society\nas pluralistic as the United States will have both religious and\nsecular grounds, it will almost never be the case that any of the\nactual frustration caused by the public presence of religion supports\nthe DRR. Given that the DRR requires not a complete but only a\nlimited privatization of religious belief, very little of the\nfrustration and anger apparently engendered by the public presence of\nreligion counts in favor of the DRR. To which it is worth adding\nthe following point: advocates of the standard view could, with Rorty\n(1995), adopt a more demanding conception of the DRR that requires the\ncomplete privatization of religious belief. But, as many\nadvocates of the standard view itself maintain, it is doubtful that\nthis move improves the argument's prospects. The complete\nprivatization of religion is much more objectionable to religious\ncitizens and, thus, more likely to create social foment. (Rorty,\nit should be noted, softened his approach on this issue. See Rorty\n2003). \n\n There are no doubt other factors that need\nto be taken into consideration in the calculation required to formulate\nthe argument from divisiveness. But, the liberal critics\nmaintain, it is unclear how those disparate factors would add up.\nIn particular, if the liberal critics are correct, it is not clear\nwhether requiring citizens to obey the DRR would result in less overall\nfrustration, anger, and division than would not requiring them to do\nso. The issues at stake are empirical in character and the\nrelevant empirical facts are not known. \n\nThe third and most prominent argument for the DRR is the argument\nfrom respect. Here we focus on only one formulation of the\nargument, which has affinities with a version of the argument offered by\nCharles Larmore (see Larmore 1987).[10] \n\n The argument from respect runs as such: \n\nHowever, on the assumption that the antecedent to premise (4) is\ntrue—that there are cases in which the state must\ncoerce—it follows (given a few other assumptions) that: \n\nThat is, the DRR follows from a constraint on what makes for the moral\nlegitimacy of state coercion—viz., that a morally legitimate law\ncannot be such that there are those to whom it cannot be\njustified—and from the claim that citizens should not support\nany law that they realize lacks moral legitimacy. \n\n The argument from respect has received its\nfair share of criticism from liberal critics. Perhaps the most\ntroubling of these criticisms is that the argument undermines the\nlegitimacy of basic liberal commitments. To appreciate the thrust\nof this objection, focus for a moment on the notion being a\ncoercive law that is justified to an agent, to which the argument\nappeals. How should we understand this concept?\nOne natural suggestion is this: \n\nNow consider a coercive law that protects fundamental liberal\ncommitments, such as the right to exercise religious freedom. Is\nthis law justified to each citizen of a liberal democracy?\nLiberal critics answer: no. For there appear to be reasonable\ncitizens who have no good reason from their own perspective to affirm\nit. Consider, for example, a figure such as the Islamic\nintellectual Sayyid Qutb. While in prison, Qutb wrote an\nintelligent, informed, and morally serious commentary on the Koran in\nwhich he laid the ills of modern society at the feet of Christianity\nand liberal\n democracy.[11]\nThe only way to extricate ourselves\nfrom the problems spawned by liberal democracy, Qutb argued, is to\nimplement shariah or Islamic legal code, which implies that the state\nshould not protect a robust right to religious freedom. In short, Qutb \narticulates what is, from his point of view, a\ncompelling theological rationale against any law that authorizes the\nstate to protect a robust right to religious freedom. If respect\nfor persons requires that each coercive law be justified to those\nreasonable persons subject to that law, and if a person such as Qutb\nwere a citizen of a liberal democracy, then the argument from respect\nimplies that laws that protect the right to religious freedom are\nmorally illegitimate, as they lack moral justification—at least\nfor agents such as\n Qutb.[12]\nAnd for a defender of the standard\nview, this is certainly an unwelcome result. \n\n This kind of case leads liberal critics of\nthe standard view to deny the fourth premise of the argument from\nrespect. If they are correct, it is not the case that coercive\nlaws must be justified to those who must obey them (in the sense of\njustified to introduced earlier). Although having a\npersuasive justification would certainly be desirable and a significant\nmoral achievement, the liberal critics maintain that the moral\nlegitimacy of a law is not a function of whether it can be justified to\nall citizens—not even to all reasonable citizens. Some\ncitizens are simply not in a strong epistemic position to recognize\nthat certain coercive laws are morally legitimate. In such cases,\nliberal critics claim that we should do what we can to try to convince\nthese citizens that they have been misled. And we should\ncertainly do what we can to accommodate their concerns in ways that are\nconsistent with basic liberal commitments (see Swaine 2006). At\nthe end of the day, though, we may have no moral option but to coerce\nreasonable and epistemically competent peers whom we recognize have no\nreason from their perspective to recognize the legitimacy of the laws\nto which they are subject. However, if a coercive law can be\nmorally legitimate even though some citizens are not in a strong\nposition to recognize that it is, then (in principle) a coercive law\ncan be justified even if it requires a religious rationale. After\nall, if religious reasons can be adequate (a possibility that advocates\nof the standard view do not typically deny), then they are just the\nsort of reason that can be adequate without being recognized as such\neven by our morally serious and epistemically competent\npeers. \n\nIt should be conceded, however, that this objection to the argument\nfrom respect relies on a particular understanding of what it is for a\ncoercive law to be justified to an agent. Is there another account of\nthis concept that would aid the advocates of the standard view?\nPerhaps. Nearly all theorists have argued that a coercive law's being\njustified to an agent does not require that that agent actually have\nwhat he regards as an adequate reason to support it (see Gaus 1996,\nAudi 1997, and Vallier 2014).  “The question is not what people\ndo endorse but what people have reason to endorse” (Gaus 2010,\n23).  Better to understand the concept being a coercive law that\nis justified to an agent along the following lines: \n\nGiven this weaker, counterfactual construal of what makes for\nmorally permissible coercion, the argument from respect needn't\nundermine the legitimacy of the state's using coercion to protect basic\nliberal commitments. For we can always construe those\ncounterfactual conditions in such a way that those who in fact reject\nbasic liberal commitments would affirm them if they were more\nreasonable and better informed. In that case, using coercion to\nensure that they comply with basic liberal commitments would not be to\ndisrespect them. If this is correct, the prospect of there being\nfigures such as Qutb, who reject the right to religious freedom, need\nnot undermine the legitimacy of the state's coercive enforcement of\nthat basic liberal commitment. \n\n Liberal critics find this response\nunsatisfactory. After all, if this alternative construal of the\nargument is to succeed, it must be the case not only that: \n\nbut also: \n\nThese two claims, however, are highly controversial. Let us\nconsider the first. Were we to ask Qutb whether he would have\nreasons to support laws that protect a robust right to religious\nfreedom if he were adequately informed and reasonable, surely he would\nsay: no. Moreover, he would claim that his compatriots would\nreject the liberal protection of such a right if they were\nadequately informed about the divine authorship of the Quran and the\nproper rules of its interpretation. While Qutb's say-so doesn't\nsettle the issue of who would believe what in improved conditions,\nliberal critics maintain that his response indicates just how\ncomplicated the issue under consideration is. Among other things,\nto establish that Qutb is wrong it seems that one would have to deny\nthe truth of various theological claims on which Qutb relies when he\ndetermines that he would reject the right to religious freedom were he\nadequately informed and reasonable. That would require advocates\nof the standard view to take a stand on contested religious\nissues. However, liberal critics point out that defenders of the\nstandard view have been wary of explicitly denying the truth of\nreligious claims, especially those found within the major theistic\nreligions. \n\n Turn now to the second claim.\nSome liberal critics of the standard view, such as Nicholas\nWolterstorff, maintain that at the heart of liberal democracy is the\nclaim that some coercive laws function to protect inherent human\nrights. Wolterstorff further argues that attempts to ground these\nrights in merely secular considerations fail. Only by appeal to\nexplicitly theistic assumptions, Wolterstorff argues, can we locate an\nadequate justification for the ascription of these rights (see\nWolterstorff 2008, Pt. III as well as Perry 2003). What would\na reasonable and adequately informed secular citizen make of\nWolterstorff's arguments? Would he endorse them? \n\n It's difficult to say. Liberal\ncritics maintain that we are simply not in good epistemic position to\njudge the reasons an agent would have to support laws that protect\nbasic liberal commitments were he better informed and more\nreasonable. More exactly, liberal critics maintain that we are\nnot in a good epistemic position to determine whether a secular agent\nwho is reasonable and better informed would endorse or reject the type\nof theistic commitments that philosophers such as Wolterstorff claim\njustify the ascription of natural human rights. The problem is\nthat we don't really have any idea how radically a person would change\nhis views were he to occupy these conditions. The main, and still\nunresolved, question for this version of the standard view, then, is\nwhether there is some coherent and non-arbitrary construal of the\nrelevant counterfactual conditions that is strong enough to prohibit\nexclusive reliance on religious reasons but weak enough to allow for\nthe justification of basic liberal\ncommitments.  (See Vallier 2014 for the most recent and sophisticated\n attempt to specify those counterfactual conditions.) \n\nIn the last section, we considered three arguments for the DRR and\nresponses to them offered by the liberal critics. In the course of our\ndiscussion, we began to see elements of the view that liberal critics\nof the standard view—critics such as Christopher Eberle, Philip\nQuinn, Jeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff—endorse. To get\na better feel for why these theorists reject the\nDRR, it will be helpful to step back for a moment to consider some\nimportant features of their view. \n\n Earlier we indicated that liberal critics\nof the standard view offer detailed replies to both the Argument from\nReligious Warfare and the Argument from Divisiveness. Still,\nfriends of the standard view may worry that there is something deeply\nproblematic about these replies. For by allowing citizens to\nsupport coercive laws on purely religious grounds, they permit\nmajorities to impose their religious views on others and restrict the\nliberties of their fellow citizens. But it is important to see\nthat no liberal critic of the standard position adopts an “anything\ngoes” policy toward the justification of state coercion.\nCitizens, according to these thinkers, should adhere to several\nconstraints on the manner in which they support coercive laws,\nincluding the following. \n\n First, liberal critics of the\nstandard view assume that citizens should support basic liberal\ncommitments such as the rights to religious freedom, equality before\nthe law, and private property. Michael Perry argues, for example,\n“that the foundational moral commitment of liberal democracy is to the\ntrue and full humanity of every person—and therefore,\nto the inviolability of every person—without regard to\nrace, sex, religion… .” This commitment, Perry continues,\nis “the principal ground of liberal democracy's further commitment to\ncertain basic human freedoms” that are protected by law (Perry\n2003,\n 36).[13]\nMore generally, liberal critics maintain that citizens should support\nonly those coercive laws that they reasonably believe further the\ncommon good and are consistent with the demands of justice. These\ncommitments, they add, are not in tension with the claim that citizens\nmay support coercive laws that they believe to lack a plausible secular\nrationale. So long as a citizen is firmly committed to\nbasic liberal rights, she may coherently and without impropriety do so\neven though she regards these laws as having no plausible secular\njustification. More generally, liberal critics of the DRR\nmaintain that a citizen may rely on her religious convictions to\ndetermine which policies further the cause of justice and the common\ngood and may support coercive laws even if she regards them as having\nno plausible secular rationale. \n\n Second, liberal critics of the\nstandard view lay down constraints on the manner in which\ncitizens arrive at their political commitments (see Eberle 2002,\nWeithman 2002, and Wolterstorff 1997, 2012a). So, for example, each\ncitizen should abide by certain epistemic requirements: precisely\nbecause they ought not to support coercive laws that violate the\nrequirements of justice and the common good, citizens should take\nfeasible measures to determine whether the laws they support are\nactually just and good. In order to achieve that aim, citizens\nshould search for considerations relevant to the normative propriety of\ntheir favored laws, weigh those considerations judiciously, listen\ncarefully to the criticisms of those who reject their normative\ncommitments, and be willing to change their political commitments\nshould the balance of relevant considerations require them to do\nso. Again, liberal critics deny that even the most conscientious\nand assiduous adherence to such constraints precludes citizens from\nsupporting coercive laws that require a religious rationale. No\ndoubt, those who support coercive laws that require a religious\nrationale might do so in an insular, intransigent, irrational,\nor otherwise defective manner. But they\nneed not do so and, thus, their religiously-grounded support for\ncoercive laws need not be defective. \n\n Third, critics of the standard view\nneed have no aversion to secular justification and so need not object\nto a state of affairs in which each person, secular or religious, has\nwhat he or she regards as a compelling reason to endorse coercive laws\nof various sorts. (Indeed, they claim that such a state of\naffairs would arguably be a significant moral achievement—a\ngood for all concerned.) According to the liberal critics,\nhowever, what is most important is that parity reigns: any\nnormative constraint that applies to the reasons on the basis of which\ncitizens make political decisions must apply impartially to both\nreligious and secular reasons. Many secular reasons employed to\njustify coercion—ones that appeal to comprehensive perspectives\nsuch as utilitarianism and Kantianism, for example—are highly\ncontroversial; in this sense, they are very similar to religious\nreasons. For this reason, some advocate for a cousin —more or\nless distant, depending on the formulation—of the DRR, namely, one\nthat lays down restrictions on all religious reasons and on some\nparticularly controversial secular reasons. (See section 6 below.)\nMoreover, the normative issues implicated by certain coercive laws are\nso complex and contentious that any rationale for or against\nthese laws will include claims that can be reasonably\nrejected—secular or religious as the case might be. \n\n If this is right, according to the liberal\ncritics, equal treatment of religious and secular reasons is the order\nof the day: religious believers have no more, and no less, a\nresponsibility to aspire to persuade their secular compatriots by\nappeal to secular reasons than secularists have an obligation to aspire\nto persuade their religious compatriots by appeal to religious\nreasons. Otherwise put, according to the liberal critics, if we\naccept the claim that: \n\nwe should also accept: \n\nRecognizing parity of this sort, according to the liberal critics,\nlies at the heart of what it is to be a good citizen of a liberal\ndemocracy. For being a good citizen involves respecting one's\nfellow citizens, even when one disagrees with them. In a wide\nrange of cases, however, an agent exercises respect not by treating her\ninterlocutor as a generic human being or a generic citizen of a liberal\ndemocracy, but by treating her as a person who has a particular\nnarrative identity and life history, say, as an African American, a\nRussian immigrant, or a Muslim citizen. But doing this\noften requires pursuing and appealing to considerations that it is\nlikely that one's interlocutors with their own particular narrative\nidentity will find persuasive. And depending on the case, these\nreasons may be exclusively religious. \n\nTo this we should add a clarification: strictly speaking, the liberal\ncritics' insistence on parity between the pursuit of secular\nand religious reasons is consistent with the DRR. For, as we have\nconstrued it, the DRR allows that religious citizens may support\ncoercive laws for religious reasons (so long as they have and are\nprepared to provide a plausible secular justification for these\nlaws). And while its advocates do not typically emphasize the point,\nthe DRR permits secular citizens to articulate religious reasons that\nwill persuade religious believers to accept the secular citizens'\nfavored coercive laws (for reservations about this practice, see Audi\n1997, 135-37 on “leveraging reasons”.  See also\nSchwartzman 2014). Still, the DRR implies that there is an important\nasymmetry between the justificatory role played by religious and\nsecular reasons. To this issue we now turn. \n\nAssume that, in religiously pluralistic conditions, religious citizens\nhave good moral reason—perhaps even a moral obligation—to\npursue secular reasons for their favored coercive laws. Assume as well\nthat secular citizens have good reason to pursue religious reasons for\ntheir favored coercive policies (if only because, with respect to some\ncoercive laws, some of their fellow citizens find only religious\nreasons to support them). What should citizens do, religious or\nsecular, when they cannot identify these reasons? \n\n According to advocates of the standard\nview, if a religious citizen fails in his pursuit of secular reasons\nthat support a given coercive law, then he is morally required to\nexercise restraint. After all, if his pursuit of these reasons\nfails, then he does not have any secular reason to offer in favor of\nthat law. Liberal critics of the standard view, by contrast, deny\nthat citizens so circumstanced are morally required to exercise\nrestraint. They claim that from the fact that religious citizens\nare morally required to pursue secular reasons for their\nfavored coercive laws (when that is necessary for persuasion), it does\nnot follow that they should refrain from supporting coercive\nlaws if their pursuit of secular reasons fails. Because our\nhaving an obligation to try to bring about some state of affairs tells\nus nothing about what we ought to do if we cannot bring it about,\nnothing like the DRR follows from the claim that citizens should pursue\nsecular reasons for their favored coercive laws. According to the\nliberal critics, a parallel position applies to non-religious citizens:\nfrom the fact that non-religious citizens are morally required to\npursue religious reasons for their favored laws (when that is necessary\nfor persuasion), it doesn't follow that they should refrain from\nsupporting coercive laws if their pursuit of religious reasons\nfails. For the liberal critics, parity between the religious and\nthe secular obtains both with respect to the obligation to pursue\njustifying reasons and with respect to the permission not to exercise\nrestraint when that pursuit fails. \n\nHave we identified a genuine point of disagreement between the liberal\ncritics and advocates of the standard view? It seems so. If the\nliberal critics are correct, all that can be reasonably asked of\nreligious citizens is that, in a pluralistic liberal democracy, they\ncompetently pursue secular reasons for the coercive laws they\nsupport. If the pursuit fails, then they may support these laws for\nexclusively religious reasons. Proponents of the standard view\ndisagree, maintaining that if the pursuit fails, these citizens must\nexercise restraint. This disagreement is rooted in differing\nconvictions about the justificatory role that religious reasons can\nplay. Once again, advocates of the standard view maintain that\nreligious reasons can play only a limited justificatory role: citizens\nmust have and be prepared to offer (at least certain kinds of) secular\nreasons for any coercive law that they support, as religious reasons\nare not enough. The liberal critics deny this, maintaining that no\npersuasive arguments have been offered to believe this. The DRR\nhighlights this disagreement, as it incorporates an assumption that\nreligious and secular reasons play asymmetrical roles in justifying\ncoercive laws.[14] \n\nAs we have explicated the view of the liberal critics, religious\ncitizens are (in a wide range of cases) morally required to pursue\nsecular reasons for their favored coercive laws, but they needn't\nexercise restraint if they fail in their pursuit. But this position\nraises a question: What's so bad about requiring citizens to exercise\nrestraint? Why should liberal critics object to this? \n\n According to the liberal critics, one of\nthe core commitments of a liberal democracy is a commitment to\nreligious freedom and its natural extension, the right to freedom of\nconscience. When citizens use the modicum of political influence\nat their disposal, liberal critics claim that we should want them to do\nso in a way that furthers the cause of justice and the common\ngood. So, for example, when a citizen deliberates about whether\nhe should, say, support the invasion of Afghanistan by the United\nStates and its NATO allies, we want him to determine, as best he can,\nwhether the invasion of Afghanistan is actually morally\nappropriate. In order to determine that, he should be as\nconscientious as he can in his collection and evaluation of the\nrelevant evidence, reach whatever conclusions seem reasonable to him on\nthe available evidence, and act accordingly. If he concludes that\ninvading Afghanistan would be unjust, then he should oppose it.\nThat he does so is not only his right but also morally excellent, as\nacting in accord with responsibly held normative commitments is an\nimportant moral and civic good. \n\n This, the liberal critics maintain,\nsuggests a general claim. Whatever the policy and whatever the\nreasons—whether religious or secular—we have powerful\nreason to want citizens to support the coercive policies that they\nbelieve, in good conscience, to be morally appropriate. But that\ngeneral claim has direct application to the issue at hand. It is\npossible, the liberal critics claim, for a morally sensitive and\nepistemically competent citizen to regard only certain religious\nconsiderations as providing decisive support for a given coercive\nlaw. Nicholas Wolterstorff, to return to an earlier example,\nmaintains that only theistic considerations can ground the ascription\nof inherent human rights, some of which are protected by coercive\nlaw. Arguably, were a citizen to find a position such as\nWolterstorff's persuasive, then he should appeal to those\nconsiderations that he actually believes to further the cause of\njustice and the common good. And this should lead us to want him\nto support that law, even though he does so solely on religious\ngrounds, even if he regards that law as having no plausible secular\njustification. Good citizenship in a pluralistic liberal\ndemocracy unavoidably requires citizens to make political commitments\nthat they know their moral and epistemic peers reject but that they\nnevertheless believe, with due humility, to be morally required.\nThis ideal of good citizenship, so the liberal critics claim, applies\nto religious and secular citizens alike. \n\nThe portrait that we have offered of the standard view (and that of\nits liberal critics) is a composite, one which blends together various\nclaims that its advocates make about the relation between coercive law\nand religious reasons. Because of this approach we have made relatively\nlittle explicit mention of particular advocates of the standard view,\nsuch as that towering figure of contemporary political philosophy, John\nRawls. Of all the contemporary figures who have shaped the debate we\nare considering, however, none has exercised more influence than Rawls.\nIt is natural to wonder, then, whether we've presented the standard\nview in its most powerful form and, thus, whether we've omitted a\ncrucial dimension of the debate between the standard view and its\nliberal critics. We believe not. The version of the standard view that\nwe have considered is one that borrows liberally from Rawls' thought,\nalbeit softened and modified in certain ways. Still, before moving\nforward, it will be helpful to say something more about Rawls' view. We\nlimit ourselves to the following three observations. \n\nFirst, Rawls' own position about the relation between coercive law\nand religious reasons has shifted. In Political Liberalism,\nRawls admits that at one point he inclined toward accepting an\nambitious version of the DRR according to which each citizen of a\nliberal democracy ought not to appeal to religious reasons when\ndeliberating about matters of basic justice and constitutional\nessentials (see Rawls 1993, 247 n.36). In the face of criticism, Rawls\nmodified his position, arriving at a close relative of the DRR, viz.,\nthat while an agent may appeal to religious reasons to justify coercive\nlaw, he may not appeal solely to these reasons. Secular reasons must be\nforthcoming (see Rawls 1997).[15] \n\nSecond, Rawls places significant restrictions on the content of the\nsecular reasons to which an agent may appeal. To advert to a point made\nearlier, Rawls argues that when deliberating about matters of basic\njustice and constitutional essentials, citizens should appeal to\n“public reason,” which (roughly speaking) is a fund of\nshared principles about justice and the common good that is constructed\nfrom the shared political culture of a liberal\ndemocracy—principles that concern, for example, the equality of\ncitizens before the law and their right to a fair system of\ncooperation. In Rawls' view, when deliberating about these matters,\nappealing solely to secular comprehensive accounts of the good such as\nAristotelianism or utilitarianism is no more legitimate than appealing\nsolely to religious reasons. For all of these comprehensive doctrines\nwill be alien to some of one's reasonable compatriots. \n\nAs will have been evident, in our presentation of the DRR, we have\nrelaxed Rawls' stipulation, allowing for the legitimacy of appealing to\nonly secular reasons that have their home in one or another\ncomprehensive conception of the good. This might render the DRR\nvulnerable to the criticism that it invidiously and arbitrarily\ndiscriminates against religion.  But the Rawlsian 'public reason'\nalternative is also vulnerable to criticism.  It is not clear, for one\nthing, that the content of public reason will be rich enough to\nprovide compelling reasons to support genuinely informative positions\non matters of basic justice or constitutional essentials. Perhaps, for\nexample, the claims that belong to public reason are only fairly\nsweeping ones that ascribe basic rights of various sorts but offer no\nguidance about how they should be weighed (see Quinn 1997,\n149-52). Furthermore, it is unclear that appealing to public reason is\nthe best way to respect one's fellow citizens. Perhaps, as\nWolterstorff and Stout have argued, respect is better served both by\nexplicitly disclosing to one's interlocutors the reasons one finds\nmost persuasive (whatever they may be) and appealing to reasons that\nthey might most find most persuasive, given their own commitments to\none or another comprehensive perspective (see Wolterstorff 1997 and\nStout 2004, Chs. 2-4). \n\nIn fact, Wolterstorff has argued that, ironically, Rawls'\nmethodology has the implication that appealing to public reason would\nbe to treat others with profound disrespect. For note that when Rawls\nformulates his version of public reason, he claims that it will\nincorporate the idea that liberal democracy is a society with a system\nof fair cooperation over time. How do we identify such a system? Rawls\nmaintains that doing so requires that we set off to the side those who\nare “unreasonable” – these being those who are “unwilling to\nhonor, or even to propose … fair terms of cooperation” (Rawls\n1993, 51). But, as Wolterstorff contends, there are many who do not\nsatisfy Rawls' account of reasonability, including those who think of\npolitics not in terms of distributive justice but other categories such\nas preserving individual liberty, protecting small government,\nmaximizing their own wealth, and so on. The implication of setting\nthese people off to the side is that, when engaging in public political\ndeliberation about some issue of basic justice, the “reasonable”\ncitizens are free to ignore the views of their “unreasonable”\ncompatriots. This, however, raises the concern that far from advocating\na system in which all other citizens are respected as free and equal,\nRawls' view has the paradoxical implication that “to follow the duty of\ncivility is perforce to perpetrate injustice” by Rawls' own lights\n(Wolterstorff 2012, 121). \n\nThird, as Paul Weithman points out (in Weithman 2007), there are\nreally two types of argument that Rawls provides in favor of his\nposition. The first is a variant of the argument from respect. More\nspecifically, it is a relative to the first version of the argument\nfrom respect that we considered earlier, which maintains that coercive\nlaws are morally legitimate only if they can be justified to citizens\nof a liberal democracy with their actual commitments and beliefs. This\nargument, if the liberal critics are correct, is subject to some\nfairly powerful replies, among which is that, given the fact that\nthere is widespread pluralism about God and the good among the\ncitizens of liberal democracies, it is impossible for coercive laws\nthat protect basic liberal commitments to be justified to them. The\nsecond type of argument that Rawls provides in favor of his favored\nrestrictions on religious reasons, however, appeals not to the claim\nthat justifying coercion on the basis of alien reasons disrespects our\ncompatriots, but to the idea that the reasons on which we rely must be\nones that others can endorse as autonomous agents. In Kantian\ncategories, this second line of argument singles out not the evil of\nheteronomous considerations, but the goodness of considerations that\nautonomous and reasonable agents could accept as an appropriate basis\nfor settling fundamental political questions. \n\nIt is difficult to see, however, that this latter argument genuinely\nmoves beyond the argument from respect. The problem is that it is not\nevident that the content of what Rawls terms public reason is that to\nwhich reasonable and autonomous agents would primarily appeal when\nattempting to settle fundamental political questions. Once again, the\ncontent of public reason may be too thin to settle anything of\nimportance. Moreover, it is unclear that reasonable and autonomous\nagents would regard as inappropriate a democratic system in which\nagents bring to the table whatever reasons that seem best to them and\nvote solely on their basis. \n\nImagine, for example, a scenario in which citizens of a liberal\ndemocracy such as ours must deliberate on an issue of basic justice\nsuch as health care reform. One approach these citizens might take is\nRawls': they appeal primarily to public reason. Another approach is\nthat they try to forge a consensus about the issue that incorporates\nfeatures that belong to rather different comprehensive perspectives.\nAccording to this latter approach, Jews, Christians, Kantians,\nBuddhists, and Aristotelians all offer each other the reasons from\ntheir own comprehensive perspectives that seem to support health care\nreform, pointing out to each other the degree to which their reasons\noverlap. No public reasons are offered, only a plethora of\nparticularistic reasons each of which is reasonably rejected by some\ncitizens. Then the matter is put to a vote. Would an agent who is\nreasonable and autonomous reject this procedure in favor of appealing\nto public reason? According to the liberal critics, it is difficult to\nsee why we should believe he would. If so, the connection that Rawls\nattempts to forge between the exercise of autonomy and public reason is\ntoo tight. (In the next section, we discuss a version of\n‘public reason liberalism’ that incorporates the basic idea\nthat respect for persons is compatible with each citizen’s\noffering to one non-shared, non-public reasons for state coercion.) \n\nA final concern is worth airing. Figures such as Philip Quinn,\nJeffrey Stout, and Nicholas Wolterstorff interpret Rawls as addressing\nthe issue of how citizens in actual liberal democracies ought to\nconduct themselves when debating matters of justice and the common\ngood. But there is evidence that Rawls' texts ought not to be read in\nthis way. For, as Rawls indicates at various places, he takes himself\nto be discussing well-ordered societies. A well-ordered\nsociety is such that it contains no egoists, everyone complies with the\nprinciples of justice, everyone wants to participate in forms of social\nlife that call forth their own and others' natural talents, treachery\nand betrayal are absent, and its members want to cooperate with others\non terms that are mutually justifiable and affirm only reasonable\ncomprehensive doctrines (Weithman 2012, 65, 162, 169, 310). In short, a\nwell-ordered society is nothing like the actual world but is something\napproximating a political Utopia. \n\nSuppose Rawls were to establish that in a well-ordered society agents\nwould conform to his favored version of the restrictions on religious\nreasons. This would not imply that, in those circumstances in which we\nactually find ourselves, citizens should appeal to his version,\nthinking of it as a regulatory ideal in their political thinking. Not\nall ideals, after all, are worth pursuing. It might be, for example,\nthat pursuing the Rawlsian ideal would make it much more difficult for\ncitizens to employ other approaches to political deliberation that\nwould result in a liberal democracy being sufficiently stable for the\nright reasons, which, says Rawls, should be a primary objective of any\nliberal democracy. If this were correct, then Rawls's project would\nhave very modest implications for how to think about the relation\nbetween religion and public reason, since it would provide little or\nno guidance for how citizens ought to conduct their behavior (see\nCuneo 2013). \n\nLiberal critics of the standard view have not been free of their own\ncritics. We conclude this part of our discussion by articulating\none important response. \n\nAt the heart of the liberal critics’ conception of religion\nand public life is a commitment to parity between the religious and the\nsecular: because there are no morally, sociologically, or epistemically\nrelevant differences between religious and secular reasons, religious\nand secular reasons may play exactly the same role in a citizen’s\ndeliberations or decision-making regarding state coercion. This\nparity claim seems flatly inconsistent with the DRR – which\nsingles out religious reasons for special, discriminatory\ntreatment. But some theorists have argued that the parity claim,\nwhich is so important to the liberal critics, is in fact consistent\nwith a version of the DRR. An argument of this sort has been\narticulated by Gerald Gaus and Kevin Vallier (Gaus 2012, Gaus and\nVallier, 2009, Vallier, 2014).  \n\nGaus and Vallier's argument rests on two central claims. First,\nstate coercion is presumptively wrong; each and every coercive state\nenactment must be justified by each and every citizen subject to it. By\ncontrast, the lack of any state policy is not presumptively wrong, and\nso need not be justified – even to citizens whose well-being is\naffected by the lack of state activity. Second, the reasons by\nwhich state coercion is justified need not be shared by (or be\naccessible to) the citizens who are subject to a given coercive\nmeasure. What matters for purposes of the justification of coercion is\nthat each citizen has sufficient reason, as judged from his or her\nparticular perspective, to endorse state coercion. Since this view\nplaces no restrictions on the reasons to which an agent might appeal,\nreligious and secular reasons can play exactly the same justificatory\nrole, namely, to defeat what would, in the absence of contrary reasons,\nbe permissible acts of state coercion.  \n\nGaus and Vallier, then, have defended a convergence rather\nthan a consensus account of the standard view. If this\naccount is correct, state coercion must be justifiable to religious\ncitizens as religious believers and when it is not, then state\ncoercion lacks moral legitimacy. The same holds true for non-religious\ncitizens. Although the convergent conception of the standard view\naccords religious reasons a potentially decisive role in defeating\nstate coercion, and so accords religious reasons a much more prominent\nrole in the justification of state coercion than religious reasons have\non most alternative formulations of the standard view, it is also\nconsistent with the DRR. How so?  \n\nIn any liberal polity, there will inevitably be some secular\ncitizens. If there is nothing to be said from any secular\nperspective that decisively justifies some coercive measure, and if the\nonly plausible rationale for that coercive measure is a religious\nrationale, then there will inevitably be some citizens to whom that\ncoercive measure cannot be justified. According to the view under\nconsideration, such a coercive measure would be disrespectful and so\nillegitimate. So the convergent variation on the standard view\nmaintains the core conviction that religious considerations cannot\ndecisively justify state coercion in pluralistic liberal\npolitics. The implications for the duties of religious citizens\nseem direct: they ought to restrain themselves from supporting any act\nof state coercion that they know cannot be justified other than by\nreligious reasons. That is, they must comply with the DRR. If\nGaus and Vallier are correct, then, commitment to equal treatment of\nreligion is entirely consistent with a version of the DRR. (Gaus and\nVallier, it is worth noting, reject the DRR as an account of the duties\nof citizens, accepting only a milder version that applies to certain\npublic officials in certain circumstances.)  \n\nAlthough the convergent variation of the standard view will likely\nbe more attractive to liberal critics than familiar alternatives, they\nstill have reason to be skeptical. The convergent conception of the\nstandard view is, after all, demanding: state coercion must pass muster\nbefore the bar of religious and secular reasons. However, many citizens\nwill have compelling reasons to reject core liberal commitments. It\nfollows that, according to the convergence view, those liberal\ncommitments will lack justification. If so, liberal critics have reason\nto reject the convergent view, not because of its implications for\nreligion but for liberalism. Consider in this regard the case of Qtub\ntreated earlier. Qtub seems to have articulated compelling theological\nobjections to the right to religious freedom, and thus articulated\ncompelling theological reasons to deny that the state may coercively\nenforce that right. In this case, the state's enforcement of the right\nto religious freedom seems, according to the convergent conception, to\nlack legitimacy. \n\nTo this point, we have been primarily concerned to articulate the\nstandard view and lay out the response offered to it by its liberal\ncritics. We have emphasized that there are important differences\nbetween these two views. While not trivial, these differences should\nnot be exaggerated, however. Both views are deeply committed to the\ncore components of liberal democracy, including the protection of\nbasic freedoms such as the freedom to practice religion as one sees\nfit. Furthermore, both views recognize the legitimacy of religious\nreasons in political deliberation, noting the role of such reasons in\nimportant social movements such as the civil rights movement. The main\ndifference between advocates of the standard view and their liberal\ncritics, we've contended, is how they view the\njustificatory role of these reasons. That said, the liberal\ncritics are not the only or even the most influential critics of the\nstandard view. Indeed, if the central argument of Jeffrey Stout's\nbook Democracy and Tradition is correct, the standard view\nhas generated a worrisome backlash among prominent Christian\ntheologians and political theorists. These theologians and political\ntheorists, who Stout labels the New Traditionalists, reject\nnot only the standard view, but also liberal democracy as\nsuch—their assumption being that the standard view is a more or\nless inevitable outgrowth of liberal democracy. In spite of their\nfairly radical position, Stout contends that these thinkers need to be\ntaken seriously by the friends of democracy, as they exercise\nconsiderable influence in certain sectors of the academy and the\nculture at large. \n\n Suppose Stout is right to say that\nNew Traditionalists such as John Milbank, Catherine Pickstock, and\nStanley Hauerwas are widely influential in the academy and\nelsewhere. Should they be taken seriously by political\nphilosophers? That depends on what one understands the role of\npolitical philosophers to be. Suppose, however, we assume that\npolitical philosophers should be multidisciplinary in orientation,\nengaging with what sociologists, psychologists, and theologians write\nand say. If we assume this, then taking a multidisciplinary\napproach in this case seems to make sense. The topic under\nconsideration, after all, is the relation between religion and\npolitics, and theologians have had much to say about their\ninterrelations. Furthermore, while the approach that the New\nTraditionalists take to our topic is different from that taken by the\nadvocates of the standard view—the New Traditionalists tell a\nhistorical narrative about the ills of liberal democracy—the\nnarrative that they tell is a philosophical one. Indeed, it is a\nnarrative whose main lines will be familiar to most philosophers\nworking in ethics and political philosophy. It is natural to want\nto know whether this historical-philosophical narrative survives\nphilosophical scrutiny. We shall close, then, by considering the\nnarrative that the New Traditionalists tell about the emergence of\nmodern liberal democracies, highlighting the response offered to it by\nthe liberal critics. \n\nThose familiar with the work of Alasdair MacIntyre will immediately\nrecognize the New Traditionalists' narrative. For in its broad\nstructure, it bears a close resemblance to the one that MacIntyre tells\nin his three books After Virtue, Whose Justice? Which\nRationality? and Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry\n(MacIntyre 1984, 1988, and 1990,\n respectively).[16]\nThe MacIntyrean\nnarrative is broadly declinist in character, depicting the degeneration\nof Western moral and political thought in the following four\nstages. \n\n In the first stage, the New Traditionalists\nmaintain that the late ancient and the high medieval thinkers of the\nwest embraced a unified philosophical vision that includes three\nfundamental components. The first component is a commitment to a\n“thick” teleological account of the human good, according to which\nhuman beings have rational natures that can be perfected. The\nsecond component is a commitment to the claim that virtue consists in\nthe perfection of our rational nature in both its practical and\ntheoretical dimensions. Practical reason, according to the\nvision, can ascertain not merely the means to achieve one's ends, but\nalso the very telos or end for human beings. And theoretical\nreason, so the vision has it, can gain genuine insight into the world\nby viewing the entire created order as participating in or resembling\nthe divine nature. The third component of the vision is that\nmoral thought and discourse should be framed primarily in terms of the\nvirtues—the virtues providing the dominant conceptuality in\nterms of which we conduct moral reasoning. To which it is worth\nadding the following point: advocates of the MacIntyrean narrative do\nnot deny that pre-modern societies had their share of moral, religious,\nand political problems. Their claim is merely that these\nsocieties enjoyed (at least in principle) the shared conceptual\nresources with which they could coherently address and remedy\nthem. \n\n In the second stage of the narrative, there\nis a fall into our current fragmented moral and religious\ncondition. Although the New Traditionalists regard different\nmovements and figures as responsible for the fall, they agree on this\nmuch: the philosophical vision that unified the societies of\npre-modernity fell apart. The teleological worldview was replaced\nby a nominalist and mechanistic one. Practical reason became\ninstrumentalized—viewed as merely a “slave of the passions,” to\nuse Hume's phrase. And theoretical reason was conceived of as\nworking in a perfectly adequate fashion apart from any commitment to\nthere being a divinely-ordered reality. Furthermore, the language\nof justice and individual rights supplanted that of virtue. As a\nresult, the state that we now occupy is one in which we no longer enjoy\na shared conception of the good, and politics has become—to use\nMacIntyre's memorable phrase—“civil war by other means.”\nWithout such a conception of the good, we now face all manner of moral,\nreligious, and political problems that we lack the conceptual resources\nto resolve or even properly understand. \n\n In the third stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists maintain that liberal democracy emerges as the more or\nless natural political consequence of the fall from the pre-modern\nstate. Liberal democracy, according to the New Traditionalists,\nis not only a political structure that protects putative\nindividual rights (such as to religious freedom), but is also committed\nto a broad thesis of neutrality with respect to notions of God\nand the good. According to this understanding of liberal\ndemocracy, the state should not enact laws that require a religious\nrationale and citizens should therefore comply with the DRR.\nGiven its commitment to neutrality and the DRR, the New Traditionalists\nclaim that liberal democracy is a mode of governance that is\nfundamentally at odds with the type of traditional religious way of\nlife that informed society during its pre-modern state. \n\n In the final stage of the narrative, New\nTraditionalists offer proposals of various sorts for how traditionally\nreligious believers should cope with being citizens of a political\nsystem whose fundamental commitments are at odds with their own.\nThe proposals are generally not injunctions to transform the liberal\nstate. Rather, they are broadly separatist in nature, exhorting\ntraditional believers to distance themselves from the liberal state,\nsay, by living in small religious communities, which owe their ultimate\nallegiance to the church or some larger religious tradition. If\nthey are correct, the DRR is both crucial to liberal democracy and an\nimportant reason for traditional believers to reject it. \n\nThe MacIntyrean narrative is intriguing but highly\ncontroversial. Liberal critics have raised the following two\nobjections to it. \n\n The first feature of the narrative to which\nliberal critics have drawn attention is its highly intellectualized\ncharacter. If John Milbank and MacIntyre are correct, for\nexample, the fall into secularist liberalism is driven by the influence\nof some fairly abstract philosophical claims about the nature of reason\nand existence, which were defended by the medieval philosopher Duns\nScotus. By rejecting the broadly Augustinian/Thomistic picture of\nreason and existence, the New Traditionalists claim, Scotus paved the\nway for the rise of secularism, which is endemic to contemporary\nliberal democracies (see Milbank 1990 and MacIntyre 1990, Ch.\n7). \n\n Liberal critics maintain that, as a matter\nof intellectual history, this is not correct. Proponents of\nbroadly Scotistic or anti-theistic views, according to thinkers such as\nStout, never had the numbers or clout to change the world as\ndramatically as New Traditionalists claim. In fact, if Stout is\ncorrect, there is a counter-narrative to tell that is at least as\nplausible as the one that New Traditionalists champion. According\nto this counter-narrative, we should distinguish two types of\nsecularism: on the one hand, there is secularism as understood by the\nstandard view, which tells us that appeal to religious reasons in\npublic political discourse is insufficient to justify coercive\nlaws. On the other, there is broadly pluralistic secularism,\nwhich tells us merely that participants in public political discourse\nare not in a position to assume that their interlocutors are making the\nsame religious assumptions that they are. Stout maintains that\nliberal democracy is committed only to secularism of the second\nsort. Indeed, even critics of the standard view who affirm\nliberal democracy on religious grounds, such as Wolterstorff, grant\nthat liberal democracy is secular in Stout's second, pluralistic\nsense. Certainly, the liberal critics maintain, there is nothing\nabout liberalism that commits it to a version of secularism in which\nthe liberal state is an anti-Christian ecclesia or an alternate vehicle\nfor salvation, as some New Traditionalists have claimed (see, for\nexample, Milbank, et al. 1999, 192). \n\n Suppose that the liberal critics are\ncorrect in their contention that liberal democracy is committed only to\npluralistic secularism. Is this commitment the upshot of a broadly\nScotistic view about reason and existence having taken root in\nmodernity? If thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, the answer to this question is also: no. Rather, both\nStout and Wolterstorff suggest that liberal democracy's commitment to\nsecularism is the result of Christians themselves recognizing that\npost-Reformation Christianity itself had become so fragmented that\nChristians could no longer appeal to scripture and tradition in public\ndiscourse under the assumption that their interlocutors would share\ntheir views regarding scripture and tradition (see Zagorin\n2003). \n\n In support of this contention, Stout\nappeals to the historian Christopher Hill who maintains that in\n17th century English parliamentary politics, one\nincreasingly finds members of parliament appealing rather less to\nscripture when engaging in public political discourse and rather more\nto considerations upon which they and their interlocutors could\nagree. According to this counter-narrative, “secularization was\nnot primarily brought about by the triumph of a secularist\nideology….What drove the secularization of political discourse\nforward was the increasing need to cope with religious plurality\ndiscursively on a daily basis under circumstances where improved\ntransportation and communication were changing the political and\neconomic landscape” (Stout 2004, 102). To which Stout adds that\nsecularization (in the second, pluralistic sense specified earlier)\nthus understood doesn't morally or pragmatically preclude citizens from\nvoicing their religious convictions in the public square. Martin\nLuther King Jr.'s appeals to religious considerations, for example,\nwere highly politically effective. \n\n The first worry regarding the New\nTraditionalists' declinist narrative, then, is that it is overly\nintellectualized, portraying the rise of secularism as owing primarily\nto the influence of philosophical ideas and not to more mundane\nsociological facts, such as the need to cope with increasing religious\npluralism. The second worry about the narrative is that the New\nTraditionalists misdiagnose the character of liberal democracy,\nattributing to its advocates commitments that they needn't\naccept. To better understand this worry, recall the pattern of\nargument that the New Traditionalists employ, which is roughly the\nfollowing: \n\nWhat are some of the claims and practices that fit poorly with\northodox theism and to which liberalism is committed? If the New\nTraditionalists are correct, at least these two: first, liberalism\ntells us that political systems should be neutral regarding various\nnotions of God and the good; they should not operate with an account of\nan overriding good for human beings in whose light subsidiary goods can\nbe ordered. Second, liberalism is committed to the claim that\nmoral and political discourse should be couched not primarily in terms\nof the virtues, but individual rights. This, say the New\nTraditionalists has rendered liberal democracies a breeding ground for\ncitizens who are individualistic, self-focused, and whose views and\nbehavior are destructive of community. According to the New\nTraditionalists, these two claims are connected. It is because\nliberal democracies do not operate with a thick notion of the good that\nthe language of rights has supplanted that of virtue. For in\norder for the language of the virtues to be intelligible, it must be\ngrounded in a thick account of the good. \n\n When properly qualified, liberal critics\nsuch as Stout are willing to grant the first of these claims:\nliberalism does not in fact operate with a thick notion of the\ngood. But they reject the further claim that this has rendered\nappeal to the virtues in a liberal democracy irrelevant or somehow\ndeeply conceptually confused. For consider, Stout argues,\nchampions of liberalism within the broadly pragmatist tradition, such\nas Walt Whitman and John Dewey. These thinkers do not fit well\ninto the MacIntyrean paradigm. At their best, Stout maintains,\nWhitman and Dewey consciously theorize from the perspective of a\nbroadly pragmatic tradition that is committed to the centrality of the\nvirtues, albeit within a society characterized by competing and rival\nconceptions of God and the good. \n\n More specifically, Stout maintains that\naccording to pragmatist liberals such as Dewey, good citizens of a\nliberal democracy aspire to express not only civility and respect in\npublic political discourse, but also to accept some measure of\nresponsibility for the conditions of society and the political\narrangements it makes for itself. And to do this, citizens must\nreason with one another about the ethical issues that divide them and\nhold each other responsible, in ways that are decent and fair, for what\nis done and said. If the pragmatist liberals are right, reasoning\nof this sort requires that citizens of liberal democracies display\nvirtues of various sorts, such as openness to the views of others,\nproper respect for their positions, and so forth. In an inversion\nof the MacIntyrean position, Stout contends that it is at least in part\nbecause liberal democracies do not espouse some overarching, thick\nconception of the good that virtues such as civility and respect are\nespecially called for. And, particularly important for our\ndiscussion is Stout's further claim that pragmatism of this variety\nneedn't lend any support to the standard view. Expressing the\nvirtues of civility and respect is perfectly compatible with appealing\nonly to religious considerations when making and supporting political\ndecisions. \n\nSo, if the liberal critics are correct, one place to press the New\nTraditionalists' narrative is its claim that only within a thick,\noverarching account of the human good are the virtues\nintelligible. There is, however, a second place to press the\nnarrative, which is its skepticism about rights. As intimated\nearlier, MacIntyre and the New Traditionalists portray individual\nrights claims as both false and dangerous, indeed, as the upshot of an\nEnlightenment conception of morality that is inimical to a properly\nreligious way of life (see MacIntyre 1984 and 1983).\nMacIntyre, for example, writes that not only are rights claims on par\nwith belief in “witches and unicorns,” but also that: \n\nIn reply, the liberal critics make two points. First, as a\nmatter of historical fact, it is simply false that rights claims have\ntheir conceptual roots in the soil of late medieval nominalism and\nEnlightenment morality, as MacIntyre claims. Rather, as\nWolterstorff argues, appeals to rights are ubiquitous throughout\nhistory. One can find them, for example, in the ancient Romans\njuridical documents such as Justinian's Digest, the writings\nof the church fathers, and the work of the medieval canon\n lawyers.[17]\nIndeed,\naccording to Wolterstorff, appeals to what we call inherent or natural\nhuman rights can be traced back to the Hebrew and Christian scriptures\n(see Wolterstorff 2008, Pts. I-II). If Wolterstorff is correct,\nthe scriptural tradition not only birthed our conception of inherent\nhuman rights, but also provides the conceptual soil most conducive to\nits survival, for it offers the most cogent account of the worth of\nhuman beings. If this is true, according to Wolterstorff, there\nis no incompatibility between the liberal tradition's reliance on\nrights and a commitment to orthodox theism. To reject liberalism\nbecause it is committed to and relies heavily on the notion of rights\nwould be a mistake. \n\nSecond, the liberal critics contend that any connection between the\nappeals to rights in liberalism, on the one hand, and a tendency toward\nindividualism in its citizens, on the other, is highly\ncontingent. Perhaps it is true that contemporary liberal\ndemocracies have in fact had a strong tendency to promote\nindividualism, where this is understood as a person's having a\ndistorted focus on her rights to the exclusion of her\nobligations and responsibilities to others. But if we construe a\nliberal democracy minimally, as a political structure that effectively\nprotects a certain schedule of individual rights (to religious freedom,\nspeech, due process, and the like), it is plausible to suppose that\nexclusive focus on individual rights is itself a betrayal of\nliberalism. After all, claim-rights almost always have\ncorrelative obligations: if you have a right to religious\nfreedom, then I have an obligation not to violate that\nright. Furthermore, I also have an obligation to take feasible\nmeasures to support political institutions that protect that\nright. Any understanding of a liberal democracy according to\nwhich citizens may insist on their rights without due regard for the\nobligations they bear to others and social institutions that protect\nthese rights is arguably both incoherent and a betrayal of basic\nliberal commitments. Thinkers such as Wolterstorff add that for\ntheists who affirm liberal democracy, it is natural to suppose that\ncitizens who ignore their obligations to respect the rights of their\ncompatriots thereby also violate God's rights. For,\naccording to these thinkers, God has a right to be obeyed, and God\ndemands that we respect the worth of each human being. If the\nliberal critics are correct, then, any individualism that attends\nliberal democracy is a corruption. Perhaps it is a corruption to\nwhich liberal democracies are prone; but individualism is neither a\nliberal commitment nor, if thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, an inevitable manifestation of liberal commitments. \n\n The liberal critics, then, are highly\nsuspicious of the New Traditionalists' narrative and the philosophical\nlessons they glean from it. But suppose, for argument's sake,\nthat the narrative is largely compelling. Even if it is\ncompelling, the liberal critics insist that the New Traditionalists\nhave ignored an important option, viz., a minimalist account of liberal\ndemocracy. According to this position, liberalism is committed to\nthe following pair of theses. First, the state is to be neutral\nwith respect to different conceptions of the good. The neutrality\nin question, however, is inclusive in nature. It does not rule\nout the appeal to comprehensive conceptions of the good when making\nfundamental political decisions. Rather, it only rules out the\nclaim that the state is committed to promoting one such\nconception. Second, the state is to protect a schedule of basic\nrights and liberties enjoyed by all its citizens. Its role is to\nensure that its citizens can enjoy such goods as freedom of religion,\nfreedom of conscience, and equality before the law. \n\n The liberal critics maintain that a view\nsuch as this deserves serious consideration by both defenders of the\nstandard view and orthodox religious believers. The challenge\nthat liberal critics such as Stout and Wolterstorff pose to New\nTraditionalists in particular is this: Given that moral and religious\npluralism are here to stay, why would Christians and other people of\nfaith want to reject minimal liberal democracy—liberal\ndemocracy shorn of its commitment to the standard view? What\nmorally feasible alternative is there to a political order in which the\nstate employs its coercive powers to protect the rights of each of its\ncitizens? \n\n Proponents of the New Traditionalism\nfind this attempt on the part of the liberal critics to marry liberal\ndemocracy with traditional religious belief naïve. If they\nare right, any political system that professes neutrality with respect\nto conceptions of God and the good is unacceptable. At best, it\nwill be inhospitable soil for a genuinely virtuous and religious way of\nlife. At worst, any such system will be an attempt to conceal the\nfact that the deep structure of liberal democracy, with its emphasis on\npersonal freedoms and procedural justice, fits poorly with the thick\naccount of the good that orthodox religious believers endorse.\nAccording to these thinkers, the conflict between liberal democracy and\ntraditional religion runs too deep for appeals to minimalist accounts\nof liberalism to be effective. \n\nThe theologico-political problem is one that concerns the problem of\npolitical authority. In its contemporary form, it primarily\nconcerns the justification of authoritative political acts, such as the\nimplementation of coercive laws. Can religious reasons justify\nthe implementation of such laws? This is the central question\nwith which political philosophers have been concerned. The\nstandard view tells us that religious reasons are never sufficient to\njustify coercive law. It therefore champions the DRR, or the\nclaim that, if a citizen is trying to determine whether or not she\nshould support some coercive law, and if she believes that there is no\nplausible secular rationale for it, then it is impermissible for her to\nsupport that law. The main responses to the standard view divides\ninto two types. Liberal critics of the view hold fast to the\nprinciples of liberal democracy but reject the DRR—in part for\nthe reason that the DRR is illiberal. New Traditionalists, by\ncontrast, reject both liberal democracy itself and the DRR, viewing the\nlatter as more or less a component of the former. (On this latter\npoint, they agree with advocates of the standard view.) \n\n Is there likely to be any sort of\nrapprochement between these views? It is difficult to know.\nSometimes, however, positions that occupy the conceptual middle-ground\nin a debate are the best candidates for unifying what can appear to be\nirreconcilable positions. In the case at hand, the liberal\ncritics appear to occupy this conceptual middle-ground, straddling the\nstandard view and the New Traditionalism. On the one hand, the\nliberal critics find themselves sympathetic with the political\ncommitments of the standard view but not with the wariness about\nreligion that often animates this position. On the other hand,\nthe liberal critics find themselves sympathetic with some of the\nreligious commitments embraced by the New Traditionalists but not with\ntheir suspicion of liberal democracy. Nevertheless, the liberal\ncritics are vulnerable to criticisms from both sides. Advocates\nof the standard view will charge that they do not take seriously enough\nthe destructive and divisive effects of religion, hard to quantify as\nthey might be. And friends of the New Traditionalism will\nmaintain that they fail to recognize the corrosive effects of liberal\ndemocracy on traditional religious ways of life. These are\nimportant criticisms, married to passions that deeply divide the\nproponents of these views. Still, members of all parties to the\ndebate agree that the task at hand is to articulate ways in which\ncitizens of a deeply pluralistic liberal democracy can conduct their\nbehavior in manners that are not only faithful to whatever religious\nidentities they may have, but are also just and contribute to the\ncommon good.","contact.mail":"tcuneo@uvm.edu","contact.domain":"uvm.edu"}]
