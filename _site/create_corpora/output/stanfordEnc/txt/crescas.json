Crescas was one of the leading rabbinic\nauthorities of his\n time,[1]\nthe political leader of the Jews of Aragon, and a philosophical polemicist\nagainst Christianity. As one of the main medieval Jewish philosophers,\nCrescas critiques the radical Aristotelian philosophy of Maimonides and\nsome of his philosophical heirs. He denounces the different\nAristotelian opinions as contradicting not only the Jewish tradition,\nbut also the true empirical and rational understanding of the world.\nCrescas assembles traditional Jewish opinion, the diverse Aristotelian\nsources, the neo-platonic thought of the apostate Abner of Burgos and\nthe new science of scholastics of the 14th century to create\nan original philosophical opinion and critique of Aristotelianism known\nto the medieval period. His philosophical book Or Hashem was\nan important oeuvre of both Judaic thought and of the criticism of\nAristotelian science which spurred the growth of the new science of the\nmodern period, which arguably started in the 14th century.\nUntil recently this book hadn’t been translated completely in any\noccidental languages, though it had influenced general occidental\nphilosophy, especially via thinkers like Pico della Mirandola and\nSpinoza.\n\n\n\nCrescas was born in Barcelona to a revered family of merchants and\nrabbis around 1340. In the first period of his life (i.e. before 1391)\nCrescas lived in Aragon during a relatively quiet period for the Jews.\nHe learned in the yeshiva (Jewish academy) of the town, which was\nheaded by Rabbi Nissim of Gerondi. In this yeshiva, Crescas learned not\nonly the traditional Jewish corpus of Bible, Talmud, and the other\nparts of the Oral Law, but also Kabbala, science, and philosophy,\nincluding the Jewish philosophy of Maimonides and his followers as well\nas classical philosophy and perhaps even Christian\n scholastics.[2] \n\nWe know that by the year 1370 Crescas was a proficient young\nscholar, a Talmudist, and a judge in Barcelona. Following the death of\nRabbi Nissim of Gerondi, Crescas and his friend Rabbi Isaac bar Sheshet\n(Ribash) became the main Jewish authorities of Aragon, and possibly of\nall Spain. People from all over the occidental Jewish World would ask\nthem legalist questions (Harvey 2010, 20). In 1387, Pierre the Fourth\nof Aragon died, and his son Juan became the new king. This king and his\nFrench queen, Violant de Bar, loved culture, and their palace in\nSaragossa became the center of culture and science. In this palace\nCrescas could have met Bernard Matege, a humanist employed as the court\nscribe. Through him, Crescas may have become aware of the humanist\nmovement in Italy, and indeed Warren Harvey has speculated that there\nwas a considerable amount of mutual influence between the\ntwo\n intellectuals.[3]\nIn 1389, Crescas\nleft Barcelona and became the rabbi of the capital of the crown of\nAragon: Saragossa. A year later the King and Queen appointed him as the\nhighest judge of all the Jews in the crown, and bestowed him with a\nhigh degree of authority over the Jewish community. \n\nThe pogroms of 1391 had a decisive influence on the life of Crescas\nand on the entire Spanish Jewish\n community.[4]\nIn those pogroms thousands of Jews perished and\naround a hundred fifty thousand converted to Christianity. The pogroms\nbegan in Castilla, but the rioters crossed the Aragon border. Almost\nhalf of the Jews of Spain after 1391 became Christian. Aragon’s\nmajor Jewish communities in Barcelona, Valencia and Gerona disappeared.\nA son of Crescas died in Barcelona, and the yeshiva of Barcelona, one\nof the most important in the Middle Ages, disappeared. In the Crown of\nAragon, the King and Queen tried to save the Jews and to prevent the\npogrom, but they were successful only in Aragon, whereas the\ncommunities of Valencia, Catalonia and the Baleares Island were\ndestroyed. Amongst the reasons for the success of the pogrom in\nCastilla was the fact that the king was a child at the time and the\nCastilian government was inefficient. \n\nAfter these events, Crescas became the leader of the Spanish\ncommunity in its fight to survive. With the help of the King and Queen\nof Aragon, he tried to restore the Jewish community of Barcelona\n(without success). He helped converso Jews who wanted to come\nback to Judaism to leave Spain for Muslim countries in North Africa. He\nultimately wanted to find a safer place for the Spanish Jews, possibly\nin the Kingdom of Navarre. \n\nThe turning point of 1391 influenced the literary activity of\nCrescas. He probably wrote fewer philosophical works (and certainly\nfewer Talmudic and legal works), while most likely writing more\npolemical books against Christianity than he had planned to before the\npogrom. \n\nUntil his death late in 1410 or in January of 1411, Crescas remained\nthe spiritual head of Spanish Jewry. As a part of his role, he tried to\nbuild a new generation of Jewish leaders. After the pogrom, Crescas\ncontinued to teach Torah, Talmud, science, and philosophy. His star\npupil in philosophy was Rabbi Josef Albo, while his star pupil in\nTalmudic studies and law was Rabbi Josef Ibn Haviva. Crescas also\ninfluenced the polemical works of Profiat Duran (Efodi). Crescas\nrequested the translation from Arabic to Hebrew of the work of Abraham\nIbn-Dahoud Ha-Emunah ha-Ramah by Solomon ben Levi. The second\ntranslation of this work under the title Ha-Emunah\nNissa’ah by Samuel ibn Motot is probably based on the first\none. The original Arabic text is now lost, so it is likely thanks to\nCrescas that this important philosophical work has survived. \nThere is a controversy about the attribution of a small commentary on\nthe secret of the Kaddish (a Jewish prayer praising God, recited\nbetween sections of the daily prayer services and on behalf of\ndeparted relatives)to Crescas. According to Harvey 2010 and Ofir 2001\nCrescas wrote it when he was a young student in Rabbi Nissim of\nGerondi’s yeshiva. In this first work we can see the influence of the\nKabbalistic school of Gerona. According to Ackerman 2013b, this text\nis not from Crescas and so there is no indication that the Kabbalah\nhad any influence on Crescas. In this short book, which is a based on a sermon that Crescas\nprobably gave on the night of Passover, he explores his opinion about\nsome philosophical questions regarding the subject of the basis of\nbelief in \n miracles.[5]\n These questions arise because of the description\nof the different miracles experienced by the Jews in Egypt. The first\nquestion asksif belief is an act of free will, or if the miracle in\nfact obliges the believer to believe in it (and in the idea that the\nmiracle worker wants to prove through the miracle). After this\nquestion, Crescas addresses the subject of the essence of miracles,\nthe essence of free will, and the relation between free will and\nreward and punishment. The sermon’s conclusion is also the only\nlegalist work of Crescas in our possession. \n\nIn this book, Crescas deals with the subject of free will in a less\nprofound manner than in his philosophical magnus opum Or\nHashem, but his opinions here do not contradict his opinion in\nOr Hashem. The difference between the two books on this\nsubject can be attributed to the development of the thought of\nCrescas.  According to one view, the sermon represents an anterior\nstage of Crescas and Or Hashem a posterior one (Sermon on\nthe Passover, pp. 34–68).  Another explanation of these\ndifferences could be the difference of style between the two books (a\nsermon versus a profound philosophical tract). The difference between\nthe two books is clearer with regard to the question of the essence of\nmiracles.  Crescas’s opinion in his sermon is that miracles by\nthemselves don’t oblige people to believe in something (as opposed to\nrational proofs that oblige belief). The reason for inherent doubt in\nthe validity of any given miracle is that the people cannot be sure\nthat God and not a human is the author of the miracle. In Or\nHashem (P. 312) Crescas asserts the opposite position. Humans\ncannot do miracles by\n themselves.[6]\nThis is\nthe reason that Crescas claims that the miracle is the best way to\nverify if a prophet is a true one or an\n impostor.[7]\nThis difference between the two works is a very good\nargument for the opinion that the sermon is anterior to Or\nHashem. Ravitzky has said that in the sermon, Crescas followed the\nideas of Rabbi Nissim Girondi, his teacher who believed in the\npossibility of men performing miracles, while years later, in Or\nHashem, Crescas retreated from this opinion and now held that only\nGod could perform miracles. The book known by the name “Refutation of Christian\nPrinciples” (we don’t know the original name of this work). This\nbook was originally written in Catalan around 1397–1398, and is\navailable only in the medieval Hebrew translation of Rabbi Josef Ibn\nShem\n Tov[8]\nand in modern English\nand Spanish translations of the Hebrew. The target audience of\nthe Catalan work is probably the Jews of Aragon who didn’t read\nHebrew, and the Jewish descendants of the conversos of 1391. In\nhis book, Crescas critiques ten principles of the Christian faith: 1.\nOriginal sin. 2. The liberation from this sin. 3. The Trinity. 4.\nIncarnation. 5. The virginity of Maria. 6. Transubstantiation. 7.\nBaptism. 8. The coming of the Messiah. 9. The new laws. 10. Demons. \n\nIn these topics Crescas demonstrates a good understanding of the\nChristian theology of his time. In the majority of these subjects he\nuses philosophical and logical arguments against Christian dogma and\nnot quotations from the Bible. This book was probably one of the more\nphilosophical works of the Jewish critics of\n Christianity.[9]\nInterestingly, Crescas utilizes\nin his polemical book some of the very Aristotelian opinions that he\nhimself critiques in his philosophical oeuvre Or Hashem. The\nreason for this contradiction is probably that the aim of Crescas in\nhis polemic works is to convince Jews not to convert to Christianity,\nand Jewish apostates to return to Judaism. The most effective method of\nattaining this goal was to utilize the most popular science in his\ntime, and not necessarily what he considered to be closest to the\ntruth. We can summarize that in his polemic works Crescas has a\npolemical goal, and in his philosophical works he has a\nphilosophical\n goal.[10]\nThe Hebrew translator\nexplains that the reason for this divergence was that the philosophical\nworks were written before the polemical ones, but after writing Or\nHashem, Crescas returned to Aristotelian science. But this\nexplanation doesn’t accord with the chronological order of the writing,\nand we don’t have any reason to suppose that Crescas retreated from his\nanti-Aristotelian critiques. \nThis is without a doubt the major philosophical work (and indeed the\nmagnum opus) of\n Crescas.[11]\n This book was supposed to be the first part\nof a two-volume work that Crescas intended to write. The set was to be\nnamed Ner Elohim (Candle of God). The second book was to have\nbeen a work on Jewish law. The original aim of Crescas’s project\nwas to counter the two major works of Maimonides by writing: I. A\nphilosophical book against Maimonides’ Guide of the\nPerplexed. II. A legal book against his Mishneh Torah,\nin which Crescas would critique Maimonides’ legal method, and\nespecially his lack of citations from earlier authorities. In fact,\nprobably in part because of his communal role after 1391, he only had\ntime to write the first book of the series, along with the general\nintroduction to both volumes. \n\nWe know that Or Hashem was written over a long period of\nCrescas’s life – no less than fifteen years, and perhaps\nmore. Because of his communal activity, Crescas didn’t finish the final\nedition of the book himself. Due to the extended period of\nwriting, we can see the development of his thought in the different\nparts of the work. In some cases, as with the attributes of God, there\nare some contradictions between the different layers of the\nbook’s development. Additionally, the pupil who edited the last\nedition of the book introduced some changes and additions with the goal\nof unifying Crescas’s seemingly opposing positions while\nmoderating his openly radical\n opinions.[12]\nExamples of these kinds of additions are clearly\nvisible in the question of free will, and are found especially in the\nFlorence manuscript. \n\nThe structure of Or Hashem is based on a hierarchical\narrangement of Jewish dogma opposed to the Maimonides thirteen\nprinciples of\n faith.[13]\nCrescas\nseparates his book into four different essays:  \n\nIn the introduction of the second part of the Guide of the\nPerplexed, Maimonides summarizes twenty-five premises of\nAristotelian science (and one more that Maimonides attributes to the\nphilosopher: the eternity of the world). In the first chapter of the\nsecond part, Maimonides gives philosophical (i.e., [neo-]Aristotelian)\nproofs of the three principal beliefs relating to God: his existence;\nhis unity, and his immateriality. In the first part of the first essay,\nCrescas explains these twenty-six premises and the six proofs offered\nby Maimonides on behalf of the Aristotelians. In the second part of\nthis essay, Crescas critiques fourteen of the premises of Aristotelian\nscience. Afterwards he argues against Maimonides’ six proofs of the\nexistence of God, his unity, and his immateriality. \n\nIn the third part of the second essay, Crescas analyzes the true\nmeaning of these three beliefs and asks whether we can prove them. He\ncomes to the conclusion that he can prove the existence of God. In his\nopinion the only way to prove the existence of God is via the need for\na first cause. If every single thing in the universe is caused, their\nexistence is only possible (just as is their inexistence) and so we\nneed a first cause that necessitates their existence as opposed to\ntheir\n non-existence.[15] \n\nIn Crescas’s opinion, we can also prove the simplicity of God,\nbut we cannot prove the uniqueness of God. We can summarize this\nphilosophical enquiry by saying that Crescas thinks that philosophy can\nprove the existence of a simple cause of the world, but it cannot\narrive at the uniqueness God of the Bible. On this point Crescas comes\nto the conclusion that the only way to know the true essence of the\ndivinity is to learn it from the divine revelation (the Torah and the\ntradition). \n\nThis philosophical development is very important for the\ncomprehension of the relation between philosophy and revelation in the\nthought of Crescas. The major trend of Jewish philosophers, and chiefly\nMaimonides, was to prove that people can come closest to the true\nunderstanding of God through philosophy. These philosophers wanted to\nput philosophy on the same level of truth as the Torah. In their\nopinion, one must interpret the Torah according to science, and the\nTorah does not teach anything that philosophy cannot access on its own.\nIn Crescas’s opinion, the true meaning of the Torah (and the\ntradition) cannot go against philosophy, but philosophy by itself\ncannot reveal the entire truth that the Torah contains. One of the\ngoals of God’s revelation is to give us some true beliefs that\nphilosophy (and human speculation alone) cannot discover. This\ndevelopment elevated the Torah and the tradition to a higher level of\ntruth than that of philosophy. There are some questions in which\nphilosophy and revelation provide the same answers, but there are also\nbeliefs that pure philosophy cannot claim, such that only revelation\ncan tell us what the truth is. \n\nIn the early stage of his\n writing[16]\nCrescas accepted the opinion of Maimonides that\nthe attributes of God do not have any relation to the attributes of\nhumans, and indeed Crescas defended this position against the arguments\nof Gersonides. But in the later stage Crescas constructed a new\nopinion. This final opinion serves as an exemplar of\nCrescas’s use of compilation from different sources with the goal\nof constructing a new and original \ntheory.[17] \n\nThe major elements of this synthesis are: \n\nThe three elements of this approach existed before Crescas in the\nwritings of different thinkers, but no one had put them all together.\nIn Crescas’s opinion, humans cannot understand the true essence\nof God, and nor can they speak of him but negatively (like the opinion\nof Maimonides). But according to Crescas, there is another kind of\nattribute: those that are relative to the divine essence. These\nattributes do not describe the divine essence, but they do describe\nthings that always accompany the divine essence, in much the same way\na flame accompanies a live coal. These attributes have the same\nessence as human attributes, but they are infinite in both number and\nstrength.  With this position Crescas pulls together the Aristotelian\nanti-Maimonidean opinion of Gersonides, Duns Scotus’s Franciscan\ncritique of Aquinas’s understanding of Aristotle, and the\nNeo-Platonic opinion of Abner in his formulation of a new\nanti-Aristotelian critique of Maimonides (Sadik 2011). \n\nOne of the more important contributions of Crescas to the history of\nphilosophy is his critique of Aristotelian\n science.[19]\n This critique takes\n\nplace in the second part of the first essay in Or Hashem.\nCrescas’s opinions regarding natural science are influenced by the new\nChristian physics of the 14th century, and especially by\nthinkers like Ockham, Buridan, and Oresme (Pines 1967). Another\nsource of Crescas’s science appears to be the lost book of\nAbner, The New Philosophy. But in this case, as in others,\nCrescas weaves together different sources and utilizes them freely in\nhis goal to build one unified opinion. This original thought\ninfluenced occidental philosophy, finding its way via translation into\nPico della Mirandola’s book Examen Vanitas Doctrinae Gentium,\nand later into Spinoza.  Some of his most well known opinions include\nthe existence of the void, the existence of infinitude of worlds, and\nthe existence of time without movement. \n\nNow we will look at a few examples of the new physics of Crescas in\nmore detail. \n\nIn Aristotle’s opinion, the infinite does not exist in\npractice but only in potential (like the infinite potential division of\na fixed distance and the infinite number of people living throughout\nhistory in an eternal world). Regarding the question of mathematics,\nAristotle denied the possibility of a distinction between different\nkinds of infinite (some bigger than others) and of the possibility of\nadjoining something to an infinite number. On the basis of this\ndefinition (and other physics theories) the Greek philosopher denied\nthe existence of an infinite body in practice, and hence he denied\ninfinite voids and expansions as well. \n\nCrescas holds three original opinions regarding the\n infinite:[20] \n\nIn the philosophy of Crescas, two infinites are not automatically\nthe same. There are differences between various infinite things. We\nknow two very different categories of infinite: the infinite that is\nlimitless without qualification, and the infinite that is limitless in\none entire dimension but limited in other dimensions. For example, we\ncan imagine a line that is infinite in both directions (the first\ncategory of infinite) and a line that is infinite in only one\ndirection, i.e. a ray (the second category of infinite). The\ndifferences between the two categories are of course more apparent (and\nmore complex) in the case of spatial planes and volumes. Crescas\naccepts the existence of the second category and draws the conclusion\nthat in such cases we can add something to an infinite. If we have two\ndistinct infinite rays starting at the same point, and I add some\ndimension (A) to the finite end of one of them, the consequence of this\nact is that I have now two infinite rays that are different in their\ndimensions, for one is smaller (only infinite) and one bigger (infinite\n+ A). The same is true regarding the question of an infinite that can\ninclude another infinite. If, for example, we posit two infinitely long\nrectangles before us, with one being 10-meters high and the other being\n1-meter high, then in Crescas’s opinion the first one is ten\ntimes bigger than the second despite the fact that both squares are\ninfinite in area. \n\nAnother original definition of infinite in the thought of Crescas is\nhis utilization of the difference between the infinite in practice and\nthe infinite in potential. One of Aristotle’s methods of\naffirming the non-existence of the infinite was to claim that the\nexistence of an infinite dimension forbids some of the laws of\ngeometry. Crescas refutes this kind of argument by the differentiation\nbetween the infinite in practice versus the infinite in potential. The\nargument goes thus: Even if I have an infinite dimension, all the real\npoints in this dimension are a finite distance from one another. All of\nAristotle’s arguments are based on the distance between different\npoints, and this response cancels these arguments. We have to note that\nCrescas’s explanation is only a development of Aristotle’s\nresponse to Zeno’s paradox of the distance between two\npoints. \n\nThis treatment of the infinite by Crescas and the (metaphoric)\nopinion that God is the place of the world, a point Crescas considered\nas one of God’s attributes, helped Spinoza build his original view that\nextension is also an attribute of\n God.[21] \n\nIn Aristotle’s opinion, all actual matter exists with certain\nproperties like dimension, quality (cold, warm, humid and dry) and\nweight. Crescas distinguishes between the different properties. In his\nopinion there are three different levels of material\n existence.[22]\n Matter in and of itself has no properties. The body is the unification\nof matter and dimensionality (i.e. matter in corporeal form). It is\npossible that a pure body without any other quality has actual\nexistence. The third level of material existence is the unification of\nthe corporeal form (matter) with some other unique form. This latter\nunification affords matter the additional properties of weight and\nquality. \n\nOne example of the way that Crescas uses this new definition is to\nrefute the proofs of Aristotle against the existence of infinity. In\nAristotle’s opinion, two bodies cannot share the same space\nbecause of the property of dimension. The Greek philosopher concludes\nfrom this observation the impossibility of the existence of a void. The\ndefinition of a void is dimensional space without matter inside. Now if\nmatter can fill a void, and matter itself has dimensions, then it\nfollows that the dimensions of the matter can go inside the dimensions\nof the void. Aristotle concludes that this cannot be, for if\ndimensions can be shared, then we have to assume that two physical\nbodies could be in the same place at the same time — an absurdity\nthat would lead to other apparent absurdities, such as the entire world\nfitting inside a grain of mustard. \n\nCrescas refutes these proofs with his new definition of the different\nlevels of material existence. In his opinion, only the common\nexistence of matter and dimension cause the impermeability of the\nbody.  A body (matter and dimension) can go inside a void (only\ndimension), but not inside another body. In this argument we see\nCrescas utilize the work of the Jewish apostate Abner. Abner explained\nthe birth of Jesus (and transubstantiation) by the argument that Jesus\nis body without dimension and can go inside other bodies. Abner\nseparated the different properties of a body from the body itself for\nboth a philosophical goal (to prove that infinity exists) and a\ntheological goal (to strengthen certain Christian dogmas). Crescas\nrefutes this possibility by explaining the difference between a body\nthat has both matter and dimension and therefore cannot go inside\nanother such body and pure matter. Crescas distinguishes all\nproperties only from matter and not from bodies. In this way, Crescas\ncan utilize Abner’s critiques of Aristotelian science without\naccepting the theological implications. (See Sadik 2008 for Abner’s\nopinions.) \n\nIn the thought of Aristotle the definition of place is ‘the\nlimit of the encompassing body’. In his opinion, place has an\nimportant role in movement. The definition of a natural movement is\nthe movement of a body to its natural place in the world. Aristotle\nexplains that the natural place attracts the body, while the body\nmoves naturally to its natural place. \n\nCrescas opposes this definition. In his opinion, place is the part\nof dimension that a body occupies within the infinite expanse of the\nuniverse; dimension without matter is only place in\n potential.[23] \n Crescas also denies the influence of natural place on movement. In his\nopinion, the movement of fire is caused by the diverse weights of the\ndifferent bodies that are aflame, and not by the existence of a\nnatural place. \n\nIt is important to note too that in the thought of Crescas,\nthe universe does not have any corporeal place. The universe is an\ninfinite void containing an infinite number of worlds separated from\none another by part of the void. \n\nCrescas devotes the sixth part of the second essay to the question of\nfree will.[24]\nCrescas begins this sixth part by explaining why the lack of choice\ncan be so problematic for pious Jews: The Torah is based on the\ncommandments of God to man, yet these commandments do not seem to make\nany sense if humans do not have control over their actions. After all,\nwhy should God tell humans what to do if He knows that they have to\nbreak the law? It would seem that a robust freedom of choice is\nessential to maintaining the significance of God’s commandments.\nNevertheless, the pious Crescas does not accept this reasoning. To\nrefute the above supposition while maintaining the relevance of the\ncommandments, Crescas uses the first four chapters of Part Six to\ndevelop an uncompromising determinism that lives in harmony with human\nchoice and a system of reward and punishment that are restricted to\nthe realm of personal feelings and self-judgment. Ironically, in\ndeveloping his theory of choice, Crescas quotes frequently from\nAbner’s book Ofrenda de Zelos (without citing him by\nname). \n\nIt is worth examining how Crescas develops his position in more\ndetail. After introducing the issue of free choice vis a vis the Torah,\nCrescas in the first two chapters describes the different arguments\n(both rational and theological) for and against freedom of choice.\nCrescas then reaches the conclusion that the decision making process is\nfundamentally deterministic, though people voluntarily choose the\nattitudes and feelings behind their own actions. For example, if we\nisolate a person hesitating between two options from the causes that\ninfluence him, such as his education and the influence of society, then\nwe might think that this person truly chooses to do either of the two\noptions. But upon closer analysis, if we take in to account all of the\ncauses that influence his will, we reach the conclusion that these\ncauses determine his will to choose only one of the two options. In\nCrescas’s opinion, humans are like bronze. A piece of bronze can\nbe made into a lot of different things: a ball, a sword, etc. However,\nsomeone (i.e. an external cause) fashions the bronze into one of these\noptions and so determines the present form of the bronze. The same is\ntrue of people: they themselves can choose between different possible\noptions, but their relation to external causes determines their\nchoices. We can see how Crescas views strong determinism through the\nway he likens human functioning to an inanimate object like bronze. It\nis important to note too that Crescas defines the will of man as an\naccord between the attractive force and the imagination — two\nforces that are common to humans and beasts. \n\nContinuing into the middle chapters of Part Six, Crescas similarly\nexplains the notion of possibility and accident. Things are only\npossible in their relation to themselves. \n\nThis deterministic description of the world (based on rational\narguments) resolves the theological problem of the contradiction\nbetween the free will of man and the foreknowledge of God. In\nCrescas’s opinion, free will, in the sense of an originative cause\nthat is itself uncaused, to decide and act does not really exist. God\nis the first cause and knows all the laws of the world. Therefore, He\nknows the entirety of that which He has determined. \n\nBut this deterministic description leads to two theological\nproblems: Crescas solves the second problem by saying that the forbidden\nthings are naturally bad. The punishment of the sinner is not a\nspecial act of divine providence to punish him, but rather the natural\nconsequence of the sinner’s bad actions. At this point we can\nsolve the first problem: according to Crescas, the goal of the Torah\nis to influence people to do right. The only way to influence someone\nto do something is to give him enough causes to do it. The Torah is\nonly another cause that tries to influence humans to do good. It is\nalso the reason why God punishes only the actions that are under\nthe control of one’s choice and the will of humans. The aim of the\nretribution is to guide people towards doing what is right. According\nto this, aiming to punish other actions that are not under the\ncontrol of humans will be inappropriate. \n\nRegarding the two latter chapters of Part Six, my opinion differs\nfrom that of most scholars. In these chapters Crescas tries to answer\nthe question of whether there is a difference between people that sin\nhappily and those who are forced to sin and feel sad about doing their\nevil actions. Crescas also addresses the question of the obligation of\nvarious beliefs. These chapters are not based on the determinist book\nof Abner, and Ravitzky thinks that they are anterior to the other\nchapters and exist almost verbatim in the Passover\n sermon.[25] \n\nSome scholars understand these chapters as a departure from the deterministic\nopinion of Crescas.[26]\nAccording to their interpretation, Crescas describes the true\nconscience of man, wherein the inner self can observe the actions of\nthe deterministic external person and either be happy or unhappy with\nhis or her actions. If the external person does something bad and the\ninner self is unhappy, it is not truly a sin because the true person\ndoes not want to sin. Instead, a deterministic process has coerced the\nexternal person into performing the act of sin against his conscience\nand his true will. According to this interpretation, the inner will of\nhumans is under their control, but the regular will that decides their\nactions is the conclusion of a deterministic psychological\nprocess. Such is the usual interpretation, and in and of itself this\ninterpretation is accurate.  However other scholars understand these\nchapters as Crescas is that Crescas is not concerned here with finding\na morsel of free choice in a highly deterministic world, but is rather\naddressing a very different problem: He only wants to answer the\nquestion of external obligation and the parallel issue of\nculpability. Back in the fifth chapter, Crescas had described\npunishment as a natural consequence of sin. After this rational\nassertion, it would seem that there is no logical difference between a\nvoluntary and involuntary sin in terms of\npunishment.[27]\nHowever, such a lack of moral distinction is unacceptable to\nCrescas. Therefore, in these chapters he wants to tell us, indeed\nreassure us, that an externally forced man doesn’t have any punishment\nfor his sin (it is for certain that he is speaking to and about the\nJews that were forcibly converted in 1391). According to these\nscholars in these chapters Crescas is not speaking about how man is\nultimately distinct and free of determinist processes of the soul, but\nrather about how man through this determinist process wants to do\ngood, yet due to some cause, external to the determinist psychologist\nprocesses, is forced to sin, and hence is not culpable — if\nindeed there was such a negative external cause that led to his\nsinning. Crescas thinks that the retribution of humans is a function\nof the interior psychological process of choice. If this process\nexists the man can be reattributed for his act. However if this\nprocess does not exist there is no retribution. The fact that choice\nand will are entirely deterministic in the view of Crescas has nothing\nto do with retribution. According to this opinion Crescas thinks that\nthe use of will and choice are the criteria for retribution but are\nnot free at all. \n\nIt is probable that the major sources of Crescas‘s determinism\nare the writings of Muslim thinkers whom he interpreted according to\nthe understanding of the apostate Abner of Burgos. This deterministic\nunderstanding of the world no doubt ultimately influenced Spinoza’s\nopinion. \n\nRegarding the question of\n astrology,[28]\nCrescas holds a very moderate opinion: On one\nhand, the stars have a general influence on humanity, but on the other\nhand, it is quite easy to free ourselves from their influences. Human\nchoice and divine providence are both superior to the influence of the\nstars. \n\nCrescas devotes an important portion of the sixth part of the second\nessay to the question of the soul’s\n essence.[29]\nThe general subject of this part is the goal of\nthe Torah, which is for Crescas also the goal of humanity and of the\nentire world. In this discussion, Crescas speaks of the different goals\nthat the Torah fulfills. The Torah helps people to fulfill their\ndifferent worldly goals, such as their relation to themselves (health,\nmorality, etc.), to their family, and to their country. In this part of\nthe essay, Crescas’s explanation is close to Maimonides’\nrational explanation of the divine commandments. But the Torah also\nhelps humans to get a spiritual reward in the hereafter. On the subject\nof the essence of the soul along with reward and punishment after\ndeath, Crescas builds a philosophical critique of the\nMaimonidean-Aristotelian opinion and proposes instead a more\ntraditional view. \n\nRegarding the topic of soul’s essence, Crescas holds a\nplatonic opinion: The soul naturally continues its life after its\nseparation from the body. The reason for this immortality of the soul\nis that the soul is a spiritual substance with a potential for\nknowledge. As a spiritual substance, the soul has no opponent between\nits different parts and any causes of loss. In his proofs that this\ndefinition of the soul is right, Crescas critiques the different\nopinions of Aristotelianism. The main stream of the medieval Arab\nAristotelian opinion on this topic (apart from Ibn Sina) is that only\nhuman knowledge can survive the death of the body. But there are very\ndifferent opinions in the Aristotelian school about this subject. An\nexample of this divergence is the opinion of Gersonides, who\nunderstands that the knowledge of immaterial law accords the\npossibility of life after death for the individual. In spite of\nthis, Averroes (as Crescas understand his view) claims that no\nindividual immortal existence is possible after death (all the\nknowledge of all people returns to its source in the active intellect).\nIn his critique of the Aristotelian opinions, Crescas uses the\ndifferent\n arguments[30]\nthat\ndiverse Aristotelians attack each other with to ultimately refute all\nAristotelian opinions. \n\nCrescas tries to prove that the soul and not the mind holds the\npotential for knowledge. After this step he argues that the true goal\nof the soul is not rational knowledge but the love of God. In this\nargumentation, Crescas criticizes the opinion of Maimonides that love\nof God is a function of knowledge. According to Crescas, love is\nrelated to the will, which itself is the concordance of the appetitive\nand imaginative parts of the soul and is not related to the mind\n(itself an Aristotelian doctrine of animal volition, as mentioned\nabove). Moreover, the true essence and the true goal of the soul is not\nto acquire knowledge but to delight in loving God. This opinion goes\ntogether with the view that the principal attribute and motive of God\nis not intellectual knowledge but love. \n\nAccording to Crescas, the easiest way to express love for God is to\nfulfill obligations to him and to do what He commands. It is the reason\nwhy the Torah and particularly the commandments that are integral to it\nare the best way to attain spiritual reward after death. The Torah\ngives the easiest way to achieve our spiritual goals. After the\nseparation of the soul from the body, the soul stands by it and\nnaturally wants to express its true essence (loving God). If the soul\nloves God in this world, it becomes joyous and can now love him more\n(because the temptations of the body don’t distract it). This\nrapture is the reward of the just in the hereafter. But if a person\ndoes not fulfill the love of God in this world, the soul becomes\ndespondent at his or her rebellion against God in the corporeal world,\nan error that it plainly understands after the death of the body. This\nprofound sadness is equivalent to the fire of hell. \n\nIn his critique of the Aristotelian position on these subjects,\nCrescas tries to construct a philosophical defense of what he considers\nto be the traditional Jewish view. He first tries to prove that the\nopinions of the Aristotelians are philosophically mistaken, and then\ngoes on to argue that what he considers to be the traditional view is\nphilosophically true. This critique of the Jewish Aristotelian opinion\nis one of Crescas’s more important . In the Jewish orthodox\ncommunity, fulfillment of the commandments is the most important aspect\nof religious life. In the opinion of Maimonides, the majority of the\ncommandments (and all of the practical commandments) are only\nintermediaries to achieving philosophical knowledge, which is the\nsupreme goal of human endeavor. This opinion is one of the more\nproblematic aspects of Maimonides from a traditional point of view.\nThrough his critique of the Aristotelian view, Crescas builds a defense\nof what he considers to be the traditional view of the commandments as\nthe way to achieve the highest religious and spiritual goals. \n\nWe can distinguish between the influence of Crescas on Jewish\nphilosophy and his influence on general occidental philosophy. \n\nJewish philosophy: As has been pointed out, Crescas was considered\nthe major leader of the Jewish community of Aragon and to a certain\nextent all of Spanish Jewry (It should be noted that at the time, the\nSpanish Jewish community was the biggest in the Jewish world.). He was\nboth the most important political leader and one of the major legal\nauthorities of his time. A significant proportion of the major rabbis\nin Aragon in the generation following Crescas were in fact his\nimmediate pupils or people within his circle of\n scholars.[31]\nCrescas was also one of the most\noriginal Jewish philosophers in the Middle Ages. His critiques of\nAristotelian science and of the Maimonidean integration of\nAristotelianism into Judaism have an honored place in the history of\nthe disintegration of the influence of Aristotle – a\ndisintegration that laid the groundwork for the development of a new\nscience. These kinds of critiques were very popular in the Renaissance\nand at the beginning of the modern period. Additionally, in the\nmajority of the subjects that Crescas deals with, his opinion is closer\nto the traditional point of view than is Maimonides’ opinion. But\ncontrary to what we might have expected from this situation, Crescas\ndid not create an important Jewish current of thought as did Maimonides\nand the Kabbala. The majority of his direct students and of the people\nin his circle came back to either a different kind of Aristotelian view\nor else a regular traditional point of view, and did not continue\nCrescas’s philosophical project. \n\nModern scholars have given a number of explanations for this\nphenomenon, most prominent of which is the disintegration of Spanish\nJewry caused by the pogrom of 1391 and the persecutions at the\nbeginning of the 15th century. Because of this\ndisintegration, the Spanish Jewish community did not integrate the new\nand original mode of thinking of Crescas, and instead went back after\nhis death to different more traditional opinions. Another explanation\nis that his opinions were ahead of their time, and people (including\nhis own pupils) did not completely understand them. Another explanation\nattributes the general rejection of Crescas to his citation of\nChristian scholars, and especially the apostate Abner of Burgos.\nAccording to this opinion, the Jewish community knew Abner’s\nideas and was dismayed by Crescas’s utilization of the\napostate’s\n views.[32]\n Some scholars also claim that the major goal of Crescas was to refute the\nAristotelian interpretation of Judaism, so following the collapse of\nthis interpretation, caused by the general fall of Aristotle, there was\nsimply no more need for Crescas’s critiques. Perhaps the most\nprobable explanation is that Crescas did not realize his original\nproject of writing another legalistic book against the Mishneh\nTorah of Maimonides. If Crescas had written this book, he probably\nwould have become not only one of the major Jewish philosophers, but\nalso one of the major legal authorities of both his generation and\nsucceeding generations. The combination of legal works, philosophical\ntracts, and political leadership was undoubtedly of great help to the\nphilosophical reception of Maimonides within Judaism. \n\nYet another reason for the relative lack of influence of Crescas on\nposterior Judaism is his intermediate position between philosophy and\ntradition. Maimonides was not only the most important Jewish\nphilosopher, but also the Jewish philosopher par excellence, such that\nthe majority of orthodox Jewish philosophers see themselves as\ncontinuators of Maimonides. For the majority of Jewish philosophers,\nCrescas is too traditional, while for the majority of traditionalists\nhe is too philosophical. Ultimately, however, and in spite of all the\naforementioned factors, the influence of Crescas on Jewish thought is\npalpable. Or Hashem is found today in a large\nmajority of the libraries of the different yeshivot (Jewish\nacademies), and rabbis from all the different streams of Judaism have\nstudied his book throughout the modern period. In universities and the\nresearch world there is a relatively large amount of interest in his\noriginal philosophy, and a substantial number of scholars of medieval\nJewish philosophy consider Crescas to be the second most important\nmedieval Jewish philosopher after Maimonides. \n\nCrescas is not a part of the very limited group of medieval Jewish\nphilosophers whose major philosophical works have been translated into\nLatin (in particular Maimonides, Rabbi Isaac Israeli, and Rabbi Shlomo\nIbn Gabirol). The non-Jewish occidental philosopher had no possibility\nof direct access to any of his works until the very recent translation\nof Or Hashem into French. Despite this fact, his philosophical opinions\ninfluenced occidental philosophy, especially through their adoption by\ntwo important authors: Pico della Mirandola and Spinoza. Pico\ntranslated some of Crescas’s critiques on Aristotelian science in\nhis book Examen Vanitas Doctrinae Gentium, and it is possible\nthat Crescas may have influenced some of the Italian\nphilosopher’s other opinions as well. The main influence of\nCrescas on general occidental philosophy is undoubtedly via his\ninfluence on Spinoza. Spinoza, himself Jewish, probably studied Or\nHashem as a young student, for Crescas’s book had a profound\ninfluence on his opinions. Indeed, Crescas is one the few medieval\nphilosophers that Spinoza quotes with\n sympathy.[33]\nThere is some controversy among Spinoza scholars\nregarding the subject of the influence of Jewish thought on Spinoza’s\nopinions, but it is very probable that Crescas had a significant\ninfluence on at least two of his most important views: the essence of\nGod and determinism. We can conclude that in spite of the lack of\ndirect influence, Crescas definitely had an important indirect\ninfluence on occidental philosophy, especially via his influence on\nSpinoza.","contact.mail":"navitshalom@hotmail.com","contact.domain":"hotmail.com"}]
