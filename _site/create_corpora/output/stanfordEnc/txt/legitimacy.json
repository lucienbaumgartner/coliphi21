This entry will survey the main answers\nthat have been given to the following questions. First, how should\nlegitimacy be defined? Is it primarily a descriptive or a normative\nconcept? If legitimacy is understood normatively, what does it entail?\nSome associate legitimacy with the justification of coercive power and\nwith the creation of political authority. Others associate it with the\njustification, or at least the sanctioning, of existing political\nauthority. Authority stands for a right to rule—a right to issue\ncommands and, possibly, to enforce these commands using coercive\npower. An additional question is whether legitimate political\nauthority is understood to entail political obligations or not. Most\npeople probably think it does. But some think that the moral\nobligation to obey political authority can be separated from an\naccount of legitimate authority, or at least that such obligations\narise only if further conditions hold.\n\n\nNext there are questions about the requirements of legitimacy. When\nare political institutions and the decisions made within them\nappropriately called legitimate? Some have argued that this question\nhas to be answered primarily on the basis of procedural features that\nshape these institutions and underlie the decisions made. Others argue\nthat legitimacy depends—exclusively or at least in part—on\nthe substantive values that are realized. A related question is: does\npolitical legitimacy demand democracy or not? This question is\nintensely debated both in the national and the global context. Insofar\nas democracy is seen as necessary for political legitimacy, when are\ndemocratic decisions legitimate? Can that question be answered with\nreference to procedural features only, or does democratic legitimacy\ndepend both on procedural values and on the quality of the decisions\nmade? Finally, there is the question which political institutions are\nsubject to the legitimacy requirement. Historically, legitimacy was\nassociated with the state and institutions and decisions within the\nstate. The contemporary literature tends to judge this as too narrow,\nhowever. This raises the question how the concept of legitimacy may\napply—beyond the nation state and decisions made within\nit—to the international and global context. \n\nIf legitimacy is interpreted descriptively, it refers to\npeople’s beliefs about political authority and, sometimes,\npolitical obligations. In his sociology, Max Weber put forward a very\ninfluential account of legitimacy that excludes any recourse to\nnormative criteria (Mommsen 1989: 20). According to Weber, that a\npolitical regime is legitimate means that its participants have\ncertain beliefs or faith (“Legitimitätsglaube”) in\nregard to it: “the basis of every system of authority, and\ncorrespondingly of every kind of willingness to obey, is a belief, a\nbelief by virtue of which persons exercising authority are lent\nprestige” (Weber 1964: 382). As is well known, Weber\ndistinguishes among three main sources of legitimacy—understood\nas the acceptance both of authority and of the need to obey its\ncommands. People may have faith in a particular political or social\norder because it has been there for a long time (tradition), because\nthey have faith in the rulers (charisma), or because they trust its\nlegality—specifically the rationality of the rule of law (Weber\n1990 [1918]; 1964). Weber identifies legitimacy as an important\nexplanatory category for social science, because faith in a particular\nsocial order produces social regularities that are more stable than\nthose that result from the pursuit of self-interest or from habitual\nrule-following (Weber 1964: 124). \nIn contrast to Weber’s descriptive concept, the normative\nconcept of political legitimacy refers to some benchmark of\nacceptability or justification of political power or authority\nand—possibly—obligation. On one view, held by John Rawls\n(1993) and Ripstein (2004), for example, legitimacy refers, in the\nfirst instance, to the justification of coercive political power.\nWhether a political body such as a state is legitimate and whether\ncitizens have political obligations towards it depends, on this view\non whether the coercive political power that the state exercises is\njustified. On a widely held alternative view, legitimacy is linked to\nthe justification of political authority. On this view, political\nbodies such as states may be effective, or de facto,\nauthorities, without being legitimate. They claim the right to rule\nand to create obligations to be obeyed, and as long as these claims\nare met with sufficient acquiescence, they are authoritative.\nLegitimate authority, on this view, differs from merely effective or\nde facto authority in that it actually holds the right to\nrule and creates political obligations (e.g. Raz 1986). On some views,\neven legitimate authority is not sufficient to create political\nobligations. The thought is that a political authority (such as a\nstate) may be permitted to issue commands that citizens are not\nobligated to obey (Dworkin 1986: 191). Based on a view of this sort,\nsome have argued that legitimate political authority only gives rise\nto political obligations if additional normative conditions are\nsatisfied (e.g. Wellman 1996; Edmundson 1998; Buchanan 2002). \nThere is sometimes a tendency in the literature to equate the\nnormative concept of legitimacy with justice. Some explicitly define\nlegitimacy as a criterion of minimal justice (e.g. Hampton 1998;\nBuchanan 2002). Unfortunately, there is sometimes also a tendency to\nblur the distinction between the two concepts, and a lot of confusion\narises from that. Someone might claim, for example, that while\npolitical authorities such as states are often unjust, only a just\nstate is morally acceptable and legitimate in this sense. The emerging\nliterature on realist political theory criticizes this tendency to\nblur the distinction between legitimacy and justice (e.g. Rossi and\nSleat 2015), diagnosing it as a sign of misplaced “political\nmoralism” (Williams 2005). Rawls (1993, 1995) clearly distinguishes\nbetween the two concepts, of course. In his view, while justice and\nlegitimacy are related—they draw on the same set of political\nvalues—they have different domains and legitimacy makes weaker\ndemands than justice (1993: 225; 1995: 175ff.). A state may be\nlegitimate but unjust, but the converse is not possible. Pettit (2012:\n130ff) distinguishes more sharply between the two concepts. According\nto Pettit, a state is just if it imposes a social order that promotes\nfreedom as non-domination for all its citizens. It is legitimate if it\nimposes a social order in an appropriate way. A state that fails to\nimpose a social order in an appropriate way, however just the social\norder may be, is illegitimate. Vice versa, a legitimate state may fail\nto impose a just social order. \nPolitical realists also lend support to those who have questioned any\nsharp distinction between descriptive and normative concepts of\nlegitimacy (e.g. Habermas 1979; Beetham 1991; Horton 2012). The\nobjection to a strictly normative concept of legitimacy is that it is\nof only limited use in understanding actual processes of legitimation.\nThe charge is that philosophers tend to focus too much on the general\nconditions necessary for the justification of political institutions,\nbut neglect the historical actualization of the justificatory process.\nIn Jürgen Habermas’ words (Habermas 1979: 205):\n“Every general theory of justification remains peculiarly\nabstract in relation to the historical forms of legitimate domination.\n… Is there an alternative to this historical injustice of\ngeneral theories, on the one hand, and the standardlessness of mere\nhistorical understanding, on the other?” The objection to a\npurely descriptive concept such as Weber’s is that it neglects\npeople’s second order beliefs about legitimacy—their\nbeliefs, not just about the actual legitimacy of a particular\npolitical institution, but about the justifiability of this\ninstitution, i.e. about what is necessary for legitimacy. According to\nBeetham, a “power relationship is not legitimate because people\nbelieve in its legitimacy, but because it can be justified in\nterms of their beliefs” (Beetham 1991: 11). \nThis section lays out the different ways in which legitimacy,\nunderstood normatively, can be seen as relating to political\nauthority, coercion, and political obligations. \nThe normative concept of political legitimacy is often seen as related\nto the justification of authority. The main function of political\nlegitimacy, on this interpretation, is to explain the difference\nbetween merely effective or de facto authority and legitimate\nauthority. \nJohn Locke put forward such an interpretation of legitimacy.\nLocke’s starting-point is a state of nature in which all\nindividuals are equally free to act within the constraints of natural\nlaw and no individual is subject to the will of another. As Rawls\n(2007: 129) characterizes Locke’s understanding of the state of\nnature, it is “a state of equal right, all being kings.”\nNatural law, while manifest in the state of nature, is not\nsufficiently specific to rule a society and cannot enforce itself when\nviolated, however. The solution to this problem is a social contract\nthat transfers political authority to a civil state that can realize\nand secure the natural law. According to Locke, and contrary to his\npredecessor Thomas Hobbes, the social contract thus does not create\nauthority. Political authority is embodied in individuals and\npre-exists in the state of nature. The social contract transfers the\nauthority they each enjoy in the state of nature to a particular\npolitical body. \nWhile political authority thus pre-exists in the state of nature,\nlegitimacy is a concept that is specific to the civil state. Because\nthe criterion of legitimacy that Locke proposes is historical,\nhowever, what counts as legitimate authority remains connected to the\nstate of nature. The legitimacy of political authority in the civil\nstate depends, according to Locke, on whether the transfer of\nauthority has happened in the right way. Whether the transfer has\nhappened in the right way depends on individuals’ consent:\n“no one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the\npolitical power of another without his own consent” (Locke 1980:\n52). Anyone who has given their express or tacit consent to the social\ncontract is bound to obey a state’s laws (Locke 1980: 63). Locke\nunderstands the consent criterion to apply not just to the original\ninstitutionalization of a political authority—what Rawls (2007:\n124) calls “originating consent”. It also applies to the\nongoing evaluation of the performance of a political\nregime—Rawls (2007: 124) calls this “joining\nconsent”. \nAlthough Locke emphasises consent, consent is not, however, sufficient\nfor legitimate authority because an authority that suspends the\nnatural law is necessarily illegitimate (e.g. Simmons 1976). On some\ninterpretations of Locke (e.g. Pitkin 1965), consent is not even\nnecessary for legitimate political authority; it is only a marker of\nillegitimacy. Whether an actual political regime respects the\nconstraints of the natural law is thus at least one factor that\ndetermines its legitimacy. \nThis criterion of legitimacy is negative: it offers an account of when\neffective authority ceases to be legitimate. When a political\nauthority fails to secure consent or oversteps the boundaries of the\nnatural law, it ceases to be legitimate and, therefore, there is no\nlonger an obligation to obey its commands. For Locke—unlike for\nHobbes—political authority can thus not be absolute. \nThe contemporary literature has developed Locke’s ideas in\nseveral ways. John Simmons (2001) uses them to argue that we should\ndistinguish between the moral justification of states in general and\nthe political legitimacy of actual states. I will come back to this\npoint in section 3.3. Joseph Raz links legitimacy to the justification\nof political authority. According to Raz, political authority is just\na special case of the more general concept of authority (1986, 1995,\n2006). He defines authority in relation to a claim—of a person\nor an agency—to generate what he calls pre-emptive reasons. Such\nreasons replace other reasons for action that people might have. For\nexample, if a teacher asks her students to do some homework, she\nexpects her say-so to give the students reason to do the homework. \nAuthority is effective, on this view, if it gets people to act on the\nreasons it generates. The difference between effective and legitimate\nauthority, on Raz’ view, is that the former merely purports to\nchange the reasons that apply to others, while legitimate authority\nactually has the capacity to change these reasons. Legitimate\nauthority satisfies what Raz calls the pre-emption thesis: “The\nfact that an authority requires performance of an action is a reason\nfor its performance which is not to be added to all other relevant\nreasons when assessing what to do, but should exclude and take the\nplace of some of them” (Raz 1988: 46). (There are limits to what\neven a legitimate authority can rightfully order others to do, which\nis why it does not necessarily replace all relevant reasons.)  \nWhen is effective or de facto authority legitimate? In other\nwords, what determines whether the pre-emption thesis is satisfied?\nRaz’ answer is captured in two further theses. The\n“dependence thesis” states that the justification of\npolitical authority dpends on the normative reasons that apply to\nthose under its rule directly, independently of the authority’s\ndirectives. Building on the dependence thesis, the “normal\njustification thesis” then states that political authority is\njustified if it enables those subject to it to better comply with the\nreasons that apply to them anyway. In full, the normal justification\nthesis says: “The normal way to establish that a person has\nauthority over another involves showing that the alleged subject is\nlikely to better comply with the reasons which apply to him (other\nthan the alleged authoritative directive) if he accepts the directives\nof the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to\nfollow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply\nto him directly” (Raz 1988: 53). The normal justification thesis\nexplains why those governed by a legitimate authority ought to treat\nits directives as binding. It thus follows as a corollary of the\nnormal justification thesis that such an authority generates a duty to\nbe obeyed. Raz calls his conception the “service\nconception” of authority (1988: 56). Note that even though\nlegitimate authority is defined as a special case of effective\nauthority, only the former is appropriately described as a serving its\nsubjects. Illegitimate—but effective—authority does not\nserve those it aims to govern, although it may purport to do so. \nWilliam Edmundson formulates this way of linking authority and\nlegitimacy via a condition he calls the warranty thesis: “If\nbeing an X entails claiming to F, then being a\nlegitimate X entails truly claiming to\nF.” (Edmundson 1998: 39). Being an X here\nstands for “a state”, or “an authority”. And\n“to F” stands for “to create a duty to be\nobeyed”, for example. The idea expressed by the warranty thesis\nis that legitimacy morally justifies an independently existing\nauthority such that the claims of the authority become moral\nobligations. \nThose who link political legitimacy to the problem of justifying\nauthority tend to think of political coercion as only a means that\nlegitimate states may use to secure their authority. As Leslie Green\nputs it: “Coercion threats provide secondary, reinforcing\nmotivation when the political order fails in its primary normative\ntechnique of authoritative guidance” (Green 1988: 75). According\nto a second important interpretation, by contrast, the main function\nof legitimacy is precisely to justify coercive power. (For an\nexcellent discussion of the two interpretations of legitimacy and a\ndefense of the coercion-based interpretation, see Ripstein 2004; see\nalso Hampton 1998.) On coercion-based interpretations, the main\nproblem that a conception of legitimacy aims to solve is how to\ndistinguish the rightful use of political power from mere coercion.\nOne way to capture the thought is that, on these views, legitimacy\nrelates to the way in which the rightful use of political power\ncreates or constitutes political authority. Again, there are different\nways in which this idea might be understood. \nIn Hobbes’ influential account, political authority is created\nby the social contract. In the state of nature, everyone’s\nself-preservation is under threat and this makes it rational for all,\nHobbes argues, to consent to a covenant that authorizes a sovereign\nwho can guarantee their protection and to transfer their rights to\nthis sovereign—an individual or a group of individuals. When\nthere is no such sovereign, one may be created by a\ncovenant—Hobbes calls this “sovereignty by\ninstitution”. But political authority may also be established by\nthe promise of all to obey a threatening power (“sovereignty by\nacquisition”; see Leviathan, chapter 17). Both manners\nof creating a sovereign are equally legitimate. And political\nauthority will be legitimate as long as the sovereign ensures the\nprotection of the citizens, as Hobbes believes that the natural right\nto self-preservation cannot be relinquished (Leviathan,\nchapter 21). Beyond that, however, there can be no further questions\nabout the legitimacy of the sovereign. In particular, there is no\ndistinction between effective authority and legitimate authority in\nHobbes’ thought. It might even be argued that Hobbes fails to\ndistinguish between legitimate authority and the mere exercise of\npower (Korsgaard 1997: 29; see chapter 30 of Leviathan,\nhowever, for an account of the quality of the sovereign’s\nrule). \nAnother way in which the relation between legitimacy and the creation\nof authority may be understood is that the attempt to rule without\nlegitimacy is an attempt to exercise coercive power—not\nauthority. Such a view can be found in Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s\nwork. Legitimacy, for Rousseau, justifies the state’s exercise\nof coercive power and creates an obligation to obey. Rousseau\ncontrasts a legitimate social order with a system of rules that is\nmerely the expression of power. Coercive power is primarily a feature\nof the civil state. While there are some forms of coercive power even\nin the state of nature—for example the power of parents over\ntheir children—Rousseau assumes that harmful coercive power\narises primarily in the civil state and that this creates the problem\nof legitimacy. In the first chapter of the first book of On\nthe Social Contract he remarks that while “[m]an\nis born free”, the civil state he observes makes everyone a\nslave. Rousseau’s main question is under what conditions a civil\nstate, which uses coercive power to back up its laws, can be thought\nof as freeing citizens from this serfdom. Such a state would be\nlegitimate. As he puts it in the opening sentence of the Social\nContract, “I want to inquire whether there can be some\nlegitimate and sure rule of administration in the civil order, taking\nmen as they are and laws as they might be.” \nRousseau’s account of legitimacy is importantly different from\nLocke’s in that Rousseau does not attach normativity to the\nprocess through which a civil state emerges from the state of nature.\nLegitimate political authority is created by convention, reached\nwithin the civil state. Specifically, Rousseau suggests that\nlegitimacy arises from the democratic justification of the laws of the\ncivil state (Social Contract I:6; cf. section 3.3.\nbelow). \nFor Kant, as for Hobbes, political authority is created by the\nestablishment of political institutions in the civil state. It does\nnot pre-exist in individuals in the state of nature. What exists in\nthe pre-civil social state, according to Kant, is the moral authority\nof each individual qua rational being and a moral obligation to form a\ncivil state. Establishing a civil state is “in itself an end\n(that each ought to have)” (Kant, Theory and\nPractice 8:289; see also Perpetual Peace, Appendix I).\nKant regards the civil state as a necessary first step toward a moral\norder (the “ethical commonwealth”). It helps people\nconform to certain rules by eliminating what today would be called the\nfree-riding problem or the problem of partial compliance. By creating\na coercive order of public legal justice, “a great step is taken\ntoward morality (though it is not yet a moral step), toward being\nattached to this concept of duty even for its own sake” (Kant,\nPerpetual Peace 8:376, notes to Appendix I; see also Riley\n1982: 129f). \nThe civil state, according to Kant, establishes the rights necessary\nto secure equal freedom. Unlike for Locke and his contemporary\nfollowers, however, coercive power is not a secondary feature of the\ncivil state, necessary to back up laws. According to Kant, coercion is\npart of the idea of rights. The thought can be explained as follows.\nCoercion is defined as a restriction of the freedom to pursue\none’s own ends. Any right of a person—independently of\nwhether it is respected or has been violated—implies a\nrestriction for others. (cf. Kant, Theory and Practice, Part\n2; Ripstein 2004: 8; Flikschuh 2008: 389f). Coercion, in this view, is\nthus not merely a means for the civil state to enforce rights as\ndefenders of an authority-based concept of legitimacy claim. Instead,\naccording to Kant, it is constitutive of the civil state. This\nunderstanding of rights links Kant’s conception of legitimacy to\nthe justification of coercion. \nLegitimacy, for Kant, depends on a particular interpretation of the\nsocial contract. For Kant, the social contract which establishes the\ncivil state is not an actual event. He accepts David Hume’s\nobjection to Locke that the civil state is often established in an act\nof violence (Hume “Of the Original Contract”). Kant\ninvokes the social contract, instead, as the test “of any public\nlaw’s conformity with right” (Kant Theory and\nPractice 8:294). The criterion is the following: each law should\nbe such that all individuals could have consented to it. The social\ncontract, according to Kant, is thus a hypothetical thought\nexperiment, meant to capture an idea of public reason. As such, it\nsets the standard for what counts as legitimate political authority.\nBecause of his particular interpretation of the social contract, Kant\nis not a social contract theorist in the strict sense. The idea of a\ncontract is nevertheless relevant for his understanding of legitimacy.\n(On the difference between voluntaristic and rationalistic strands in\nliberalism, see Waldron 1987.) \nKant, unlike Hobbes, recognizes the difference between legitimate and\neffective authority. For the head of the civil state is under an\nobligation to obey public reason and to enact only laws to which all\nindividuals could consent. If he violates this obligation, however, he\nstill holds authority, even if his authority ceases to be legitimate.\nThis view is best explained in relation to Kant’s often\ncriticized position on the right to revolution. Kant famously denied\nthat there is a right to revolution (Kant, Perpetual Peace,\nAppendix II; for a recent discussion, see Flikschuh 2008). Kant\nstresses that while “a people”—as united in the\ncivil state—is sovereign, its individual members are under the\nobligation to obey the head of the state thus established. This\nobligation is such that it is incompatible with a right to revolution.\nKant offers a transcendental argument for his position (Kant\nPerpetual Peace, Appendix II; Arendt 1992). A right to\nrevolution would be in contradiction with the idea that individuals\nare bound by public law, but without the idea of citizens being bound\nby public law, there cannot be a civil state—only anarchy. As\nmentioned earlier, however, there is a duty to establish a civil\nstate. Kant’s position implies that the obligation of\nindividuals to obey a head of state is not conditioned upon the\nruler’s performance. In particular, the obligation to obey does\nnot cease when the laws are unjust. \nKant’s position on the right to revolution may suggest that he\nregards political authority as similarly absolute as Hobbes. But Kant\nstresses that the head of state is bound by the commands of public\nreason. This is manifest in his insistence on freedom of the pen:\n“a citizen must have, with the approval of the ruler himself,\nthe authorization to make known publicly his opinions about what it is\nin the ruler’s arrangements that seems to him to be a wrong\nagainst the commonwealth” (Kant Theory and Practice\n8:304). While there is no right to revolution, political authority is\nonly legitimate if the head of state respects the social contract. But\npolitical obligations arise even from illegitimate authority. If the\nhead of state acts in violation of the social contract and hence of\npublic reason, for example by restricting citizens’ freedom of\npolitical criticism, citizens are still obligated to obey. \nIn 2004, Ripstein argued that much of the contemporary literature on\npolitical legitimacy has been dominated by a focus on the\njustification of authority, rather than coercive political power\n(Ripstein 2004). In the literature since then, it looks as if the\ntables are turning, especially if one considers the debates on\ninternational and global legitimacy (section 5). But prominent earlier\ncoercion-based accounts include those by Nagel (1987) and by\ncontemporary Kantians such as Rawls and Habermas (to be discussed in\nsections 3.3. and 4.3., respectively). \nLet me briefly mention other important coercion-based interpretations.\nJean Hampton (1998; drawing on Anscombe 1981) offers an elegant\ncontemporary explication of Hobbes’ view. According to her,\npolitical authority “is invented by a group of people who\nperceive that this kind of special authority as necessary for the\ncollective solution of certain problems of interaction in their\nterritory and whose process of state creation essentially involves\ndesigning the content and structure of that authority so that it meets\nwhat they take to be their needs” (Hampton 1998: 77). Her theory\nlinks the authority of the state to its ability to enforce a solution\nto coordination and cooperation problems. Coercion is the necessary\nfeature that enables the state to provide an effective solution to\nthese problems, and the entitlement to use coercion is what\nconstitutes the authority of the state. The entitlement to use\ncoercion distinguishes such minimally legitimate political authority\nfrom a mere use of power. Hampton draws a further distinction between\nminimal legitimacy and what she calls full moral legitimacy, which\nobtains when political authority is just. \nBuchanan (2002) also argues that legitimacy is concerned with the\njustification of coercive power. Buchanan points out that this makes\nlegitimacy a more fundamental normative concept than authority. Like\nHampton, he advocates a moralized interpretation of legitimacy.\nAccording to him, “an entity has political legitimacy if and\nonly if it is morally justified in wielding political power”\n(2002: 689). Political authority, in his approach, obtains if an\nentity is legitimate in this sense and if some further conditions,\nrelating to political obligation, are met (2002: 691). Stilz (2009)\noffers a coercion-centered account of state legitimacy that draws on\nboth Kant and Rousseau. \nHistorically speaking, the dominant view has been that legitimate\npolitical authority entails political obligations. Locke, for example,\nwrites: “every man, by consenting with others to make one body\npolitic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to\nevery one of that society to submit to the determination of the\nmajority, and to be concluded by it; or else this original compact,\nwhereby he with others incorporates into one society, would signify\nnothing, and be no compact if he be left free and under no other ties\nthan he was in before in the state of nature” (Locke 1990\n[1690]: 52f). \nWhile this is still the view many hold, not all do. Some take the\nquestion of what constitutes legitimate authority to be distinct from\nthe question of what political obligations people have. Ronald Dworkin\n(1986: 191) defends a view of this sort. Dworkin (1986) treats\npolitical obligations as a fundamental normative concept in its own\nright. What he calls “associative obligations” arise, not\nfrom legitimate political authority, but directly from membership in a\npolitical community. (For a critical discussion of this account, see\nSimmons 2001; Wellman 1996.) \nApplbaum (2010) offers a conceptual argument to challenge the view\nthat legitimate political authority entails an obligation to obey.\nApplbaum grants that legitimate political authority has the capacity\nto change the normative status of those under its rule, as Raz (1986),\nfor example, has influentially argued, and that this capacity should\nbe interpreted as a moral power in Hohfeld’s sense, not as a claim\nright to rule. But, Applbaum argues, Hohfeldian powers, unlike rights,\nare not correlated with duties; they are correlated with liabilities.\nOn Applbaum’s view, legitimate political authority thus has the\ncapacity to create a liability for those under its rule, but not an\nobligation. To be liable to legitimate politcal authority means to not\nbe free from the authority’s power or control. To be sure, the\nliability might be to be subject to a duty, but to be liable to be put\nunder a duty to obey should not be confused with being under a duty to\nobey (see also Perry 2013 on this distinction). \nViews that dissociate legitimate authority from political obligation\nhave some appeal to those who aim to counter Robert Paul Wolff’s\ninfluential anarchist argument. The argument highlights what today is\nsometimes called the subjection problem (Perry 2013): how can\nautonomous individuals be under a\ngeneral—content-independent—obligation to subject their\nwill to the will of someone else? A content-independent obligation to\nobey the state is an obligation to obey a state’s directives as\nsuch, independently of their content. Wolff (1970) argues that because\nthere cannot be such a general obligation to obey the state, states\nare necessarily illegitimate. \nEdmundson (1998) has a first response to the anarchist challenge. He\nargues that while legitimacy establishes a justification for the state\nto issue directives, it does not create even a prima facie duty to\nobey its commands. He claims that the moral duty to obey the commands\nof legitimate political authority arises only if additional conditions\nare met. \nSimmons (2001) has a different response to Wolff. Simmons draws a\ndistinction between the moral justification of states and the\npolitical legitimacy of a particular, historically realized, state and\nits directives. According to Simmons, the state’s justification\ndepends on its moral defensibility. If it can successfully be shown\nthat having a state is morally better than not having a state (Simmons\n2001: 125), the state is justified. But moral justification is only\nnecessary, not sufficient, for political legitimacy, according to\nSimmons. The reason is that our moral obligations are to everyone,\nincluding citizens of other states, not to the particular state we\nlive in. A particular state’s legitimacy, understood as the\ncapacity to generate and enforce a duty to obey, depends on\ncitizens’ actual consent. While there is no general moral duty\nto obey the particular state we live in, we may have a political\nobligation to obey if we have given our prior consent to this state.\nThe absence of a general moral duty to obey the state thus does not\nimply that all states are necessarily illegitimate (Simmons 2001:\n137). \nInsofar as legitimacy, understood normatively, defines which political\ninstitutions and which decisions made within them are acceptable, and,\nin some cases, what kind of obligations people who are governed by\nthese institutions incur, there is the question what grounds this\nnormativity. This section briefly reviews different accounts that have\nbeen given of the sources of legitimacy. \nWhile there is a strong voluntarist line of thought in Christian\npolitical philosophy, it was in the 17th century that\nconsent came to be seen as the main source of political legitimacy.\nThe works of Hugo Grotius, Hobbes, and Samuel Pufendorf tend to be\nseen as the main turning point that eventually led to the replacement\nof natural law and divine authority theories of legitimacy (see\nSchneewind 1998; Hampton 1998). The following passage from\nGrotius’ On the Law of War and Peace expresses the\nmodern perspective: “But as there are several Ways of Living,\nsome better than others, and every one may chuse which he pleases of\nall those Sorts; so a People may chuse what Form of Government they\nplease: Neither is the Right which the Sovereign has over his Subjects\nto be measured by this or that Form, of which divers Men have\ndifferent Opinions, but by the Extent of the Will of those who\nconferred it upon him” (cited by Tuck 1993: 193). It was\nLocke’s version of social contract theory that elevated consent\nto the main source of the legitimacy of political authority. \nRaz helpfully distinguishes among three ways in which the relation\nbetween consent and legitimate political authority may be understood\n(1995: 356): (i) consent of those governed is a necessary condition\nfor the legitimacy of political authority; (ii) consent is not\ndirectly a condition for legitimacy, but the conditions for the\nlegitimacy of authority are such that only political authority that\nenjoys the consent of those governed can meet them; (iii) the\nconditions of legitimate political authority are such that those\ngoverned by that authority are under an obligation to consent. \nLocke and his contemporary followers such as Nozick (1974) or Simmons\n(2001), but also Rousseau and his followers defend a version of\n(i)—the most typical form that consent theories take. Greene\n(2016) defends a version of this view she calls the quality consent\nview. Versions of (ii) appeal to those who reject actual consent as a\nbasis for legitimacy, as they only regard consent given under ideal\nconditions as binding. Theories of hypothetical consent, such as those\narticulated by Kant or Rawls, fall into this category. Such theories\nview political authority as legitimate only if those governed would\nconsent under certain ideal conditions (cf. section 3.3.). \nDavid Estlund (2008: 117ff) defends a version of hypothetical consent\ntheory that matches category (iii). What he calls “normative\nconsent” is a theory that regards non-consent to authority,\nunder certain conditions as invalid. Authority, in this view, may thus\nbe justified without actual consent. Estlund defines authority as the\nmoral power to require action. Estlund uses normative consent theory\nas the basis for an account of democratic legitimacy, understood as\nthe permissibility of using coercion to enforce authority. The work\nthat normative consent theory does in Estlund’s account is that\nit contributes to the justification of the authority of the democratic\ncollective over those who disagree with certain democratically\napproved laws. \nAlthough consent theory has been dominating for a long time, there are\nmany well-known objections to it. As mentioned in section 2.1, Simmons\n(2001) argues that hypothetical consent theories (and, presumably,\nnormative consent theories, too) conflate moral justification with\nlegitimation. Other objections, especially to Lockean versions, are\nabout as old as consent theory itself. David Hume, in his essay\n“Of the Original Contract”, and many after him object to\nLocke that consent is not feasible, and that actual states have almost\nalways arisen from acts of violence. The attempt to legitimize\npolitical authority via consent is thus, at best, wishful thinking\n(Wellman 1996). What is worse, it may obscure problematic structures\nof subordination (Pateman 1988). Hume’s own solution was, like\nBentham later, to propose to justify political authority with\nreference to its beneficial consequences. \nIn the utilitarian view, legitimate political authority should be\ngrounded on the principle of utility. This conception of legitimacy is\nnecessarily a moralized one: the legitimacy of political authority\ndepends on what morality requires. Christian Thomasius, a student of\nPufendorf and contemporary of Locke, may be seen as a precursor of the\nutilitarian approach to political legitimacy, as he rejected\nvoluntarism and endorsed the idea that political legitimacy depends on\nprinciples of rational prudence instead (Schneewind 1998: 160; Barnard\n2001: 66). Where Thomasius differs from the utilitarians, however, is\nin his attempt to identify a distinctively political—not moral\nor legal—source of legitimacy. He developed the idea of\n“decorum” into a theory of how people should relate to one\nanother in the political context. Decorum is best described as a\nprinciple of “civic mutuality” (Barnard 2001: 65):\n“You treat others as you would expect them to treat you”\n(Thomasius, Foundations of the Law of Nature and of Nations,\nquoted by Barnard 2001: 65). By thus distinguishing legitimacy from\nlegality and justice, Thomasius adopted an approach that was\nconsiderably ahead of his time. \nJeremy Bentham rejects the Hobbesian idea that political authority is\ncreated by a social contract. According to Bentham, it is the state\nthat creates the possibility of binding contracts. The problem of\nlegitimacy that the state faces is which of its laws are justified.\nBentham proposes that legitimacy depends on whether a law contributes\nto the happiness of the citizens. (For a contemporary take on this\nutilitarian principle of legitimacy, see Binmore 2000.) \nA well-known problem with the view that Bentham articulates is that it\njustifies restrictions of rights that liberals find unacceptable. John\nStuart Mill’s answer to this objection consists, on the one\nhand, in an argument for the compatibility between utilitarianism and\nthe protection of liberty rights and, on the other, in an\ninstrumentalist defense of democratic political authority based on the\nprinciple of utility. According to Mill, both individual freedom and\nthe right to participate in politics are necessary for the\nself-development of individuals (Mill On Liberty and\nConsiderations on Representative Government, see Brink 1992;\nTen 1998). \nWith regard to the defense of liberty rights, Mill argues that the\nrestriction of liberty is illegitimate unless it is permitted by the\nharm principle, that is, unless the actions suppressed by the\nrestriction harm others (On Liberty, chapter 1; for a\ncritical discussion of the harm principle as the basis of legitimacy,\nsee Wellman 1996; see also Turner 2014). Mill’s view of the\ninstrumental value of (deliberative) democracy is expressed in the\nfollowing passage of the first chapter of On Liberty:\n“Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with\nbarbarians, provided that the end be their improvement and the means\njustified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has\nno application to any state of things anterior to the time when\nmankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal\ndiscussion.” Deliberation is important, according to Mill,\nbecause of his belief in the power of ideas—in what Habermas\nwould later call the force of the better argument (Habermas 1990:\n158f). Deliberation should keep partisan interests, which could\nthreaten legitimacy by undermining the general happiness, in check:\n“The representative system ought … not to allow any of\nthe various sectional interests to be so powerful as to be capable of\nprevailing against truth and justice and the other sectional interests\ncombined. There ought always to be such a balance preserved among\npersonal interests as may render any one of them dependent for its\nsuccesses, on carrying with it as least a large proportion of those\nwho act on higher motives, and more comprehensive and distant\nviews” (Mill, Collected Works XIX: 447, cited by Ten\n1998: 379). \nMany are not convinced that such instrumentalist reasoning provides a\nsatisfactory account of political legitimacy. Rawls (1971:175f) and\nJeremy Waldron (1987: 143f) object that the utilitarian approach will\nultimately only convince those who stand to benefit from the felicific\ncalculus, and that it lacks an argument to convince those who stand to\nlose. \nFair play theories offer one answer to this problem (see Klosko 2004\nand the entry on\n political obligation).\n Another answer comes from perfectionist theories. The best example is\nRaz’ service conception of legitimate authority (section 2.1.).\nRaz tries to show how an account of legitimacy based on beneficial\nconsequences is compatible with everyone having reasons to obey the\ndirectives of a legitimate authority. According to Raz (1995: 359),\n“[g]overnments decide what is best for their subjects and\npresent them with the results as binding conclusions that they are\nbound to follow.” The justification for this view that Raz gives\n(“the normal justification thesis”) is, as explained\nabove, that if the authority is legitimate, its directives are such\nthat they help those governed to better comply with reasons that apply\nto them. (For criticisms of this approach, see Hershovitz 2003 and\n2011, Nussbaum 2011, and Quong 2011). \nWellman’s (1996) samaritan account of political legitimacy is\nalso an attempt to overcome the problem that showing that political\ninstitutions and the decisions made within them have beneficial\nconsequences is not sufficient for political legitimacy. In his\naccount, a state’s legitimacy depends on it being justified to\nuse coercion to enforce its laws. His suggestion is that the\njustification of the state can be grounded in the samaritan duty to\nhelp others in need. The thought is that “what ultimately\nlegitimizes a state’s imposition upon your liberty is\nnot merely the services it provides you, but the benefits it\nprovides others” (Wellman 1996: 213; his emphasis).\nWellman argues that because “political society is the only\nvehicle with which people can escape the perils of the state of\nnature” (Wellman 1996: 216), people have a samaritan duty to\nprovide to one another the benefits of a state. Associated\nrestrictions of their liberty by the state, Wellman claims, are\nlegitimate. \nAn important legacy of consent theory in contemporary thought is\nmanifest in accounts that attribute the source of legitimacy either to\nan idea of public reason—taking the lead from Kant—or to a\ntheory of democratic participation—taking the lead from\nRousseau. Theories of deliberative democracy combine elements of both\naccounts.  \nPublic reason accounts tend to focus on the problem of justifying\npolitical coercion. The solution they propose is that political\ncoercion is justified if it is supported on the basis of reasons that\nall reasonable persons can share. Interest in public reason accounts\nstarted with Rawls’ Political Liberalism, but Rawls\ndeveloped the idea more fully in later works. Rawls’\nstarting-point is the following problem of legitimacy (Rawls 2001:\n41): “in the light of what reasons and values … can\ncitizens legitimately exercise … coercive power over one\nanother?” The solution to this problem that Rawls proposes is\nthe following “liberal principle of legitimacy”:\n“political power is legitimate only when it is exercised in\naccordance with a constitution (written or unwritten) the essentials\nof which all citizens, as reasonable and rational, can endorse in the\nlight of their common human reason” (Rawls 2001: 41). \nRawls idea of public reason, which is at the core of the liberal\nprinciple of legitimacy, rests on the method of\n“political”—as opposed to\n“metaphysical”—justification that Rawls has\ndeveloped in response to critics of his theory of justice as fairness\n(Rawls 1985). This means that public reason should be\n“freestanding” in the same way as his theory of justice is. Public\nreason should involve only political values and be independent\nof—potentially controversial—comprehensive moral or\nreligious doctrines of the good. This restricts the content of public\nreason to what is given by the family of what Rawls calls political\nconceptions of justice (Rawls 2001: 26). Rawls recognizes that because\nthe content of the idea of public reason is restricted, the domain to\nwhich it should apply must be restricted too. The question is: in what\ncontext is it important that the restriction on reason is observed?\nRawls conceives of the domain of public reason as limited to matters\nof constitutional essentials and basic justice and as applying\nprimarily—but not only—to judges, government officials,\nand candidates for public office when they decide on matters of\nconstitutional essentials and basic justice. \nSimmons (2001) criticizes Rawls’ approach for mistakenly\nblurring the distinction between justifying the state and political\nlegitimacy (see also section 2.3.). A Rawlsian could reply, however,\nthat the problem of legitimacy centrally involves the justification of\ncoercion and that legitimacy should thus be understood as what\ncreates—rather than merely justifies—political authority.\nThe following thought supports this claim. Rawls—in\nPolitical Liberalism—explicitly focuses on the\ndemocratic context. It is a particular feature of democracy that the\nright to rule is created by those who are ruled. As Hershovitz puts it\nin his critique of the Razian approach to political legitimacy, in a\ndemocracy there is no sharp division between the “binders”\nand the “bound” (2003: 210f). The political authority of\nthe democratic assembly is thus entailed by some account of the\nconditions under which citizens may legitimately exercise coercive\npower over one another (Peter 2008; Kolodny 2014a,b). But even if\nSimmons’ objection can be refuted in this way, a further problem for\npublic reason accounts is whether they can successfully show that some\nform of public justification is indeed required for political\nlegitimacy (see Enoch 2015). \nRecent public reason accounts have developed Rawls’ original idea in\ndifferent ways (see also the entry on public reason). Those following\nRawls more closely will understand public reasons as reasons that\nattract a—hypothetical—consensus. On this interpretation,\na public reason is a reason that all reasonable persons can be\nexpected to endorse. The target of the consensus is either the\npolitical decisions themselves or the procedure through which\npolitical decisions are made. On a common reading today, the Rawlsian\nidea of public reason is understood in terms of a hypothetical\nconsensus on substantive reasons (e.g. Quong 2011). On those\nconceptions, the use of political coercion is legitimate if it is\nsupported by substantive reasons that all reasonable persons can be\nexpected to endorse. The problem with this interpretation of public\nreason is that the demand for a consensus on substantive reasons in\ncircumstances of moral and religious pluralism and disagreement is\nthat it either relies on a very restrictive characterization of\nreasonable persons or ends up with a very limited domain for\nlegitimate political coercion. \nRawls’ conception of political legitimacy can also be understood in\nterms of procedural reasons (Peter 2008). On this interpretation, the\ndomain of public reason is limited to the justification of the process\nof political decision-making, and need not extend to the substantive\n(as opposed to the procedural) reasons people might hold to justify a\ndecision. For example, if the hypothetical consensus supports\ndemocratic decision-making, then the justification for a decision is\nthat it has been made democratically. Of course, a political decision\nthat is legitimate in virtue of the procedure in which it has been\nmade may not be fully just. But this is just a reflection of the fact\nthat legitimacy is a weaker idea than justice. \nAn alternative interpretation of the public reason account focuses on\nconvergence, not consensus (Gaus 2011). A political decision is\nlegitimized on the basis of public reason, on this account, if\nreasonable persons can converge on that decision. They need not agree\non the—substantive or procedural—reasons that support a\ndecision. Instead, it is argued, it is sufficient for political\nlegitimacy if all can agree that a particular decision should be made,\neven if they disagree about the reasons that support this decision.\nNote that the convergence needs not be actual; it can be\nhypothetical. \nAccounts that emphasize political participation or political influence\nregard a political decision as legitimate if it has been made in a\nprocess that allows for equal participation of all relevant persons.\nThey thus see political legitimacy as dependent on the participation\nor influence of all, to paraphrase Bernard Manin’s (1987)\nexpression, not on the will of all, as consent theories do, or on a\njustification all can access, as public reason accounts do. Older\naccounts of this kind focus on democratic participation (Pateman\n1970). Newer accounts include deliberative democracy accounts (Manin\n1987) and Philipp Pettit’s equal control view (Pettit 2012). \nRousseau’s solution to the problem of how to explain the\nlegitimacy of political decisions has influenced many contemporary\ndemocratic theorists (section 4.3.). One of the important departures\nfrom Locke’s version of social contract theory that Rousseau\nproposes is that tacit consent is not sufficient for political\nlegitimacy. Without citizens’ active participation in the\njustification of a state’s laws, Rousseau maintains, there is no\nlegitimacy. According to Rousseau, one’s will cannot be\nrepresented, as this would distort the general will, which alone is\nthe source of legitimacy: “The engagements that bind us to the\nsocial body are obligatory only because they are mutual… the\ngeneral will, to be truly such, should be general in its object as\nwell as in its essence; … it should come from all to apply to\nall; and … it loses its natural rectitude when it is directed\ntowards any individual, determinate object” (Rousseau,\nSocial Contract, II:4; see also ibid. I:3 and Rawls\n2007: 231f). \nRousseau distinguishes among a citizen’s private will, which\nreflects personal interests, a citizen’s general will, which\nreflects an interpretation of the common good, and the general will,\nwhich truly reflects the common good. A democratic decision is always\nabout the common good. In democratic decision-making, citizens thus\ncompare their interpretations of the general will. If properly\nconducted, it reveals the general will. This is the legitimate\ndecision. \nActive participation by all may not generate a consensus. So why would\nthose who oppose a particular decision be bound by that decision?\nRousseau’s answer to this question is the following. On\nRousseau’s view, citizens can—and will want to—learn\nfrom democratic decisions. Since the democratic decision, if conducted\nproperly, correctly reveals the general will, those who voted against\na particular proposal will recognize that they were wrong and will\nadjust their beliefs about what the general will is. In this ingenious\nway, individuals are only bound by their own will, but everyone is\nbound by a democratic decision. \nThis section takes a closer look at the relationship between democracy\nand political legitimacy. In contemporary political philosophy, many,\nbut by no means all, hold that democracy is necessary for political\nlegitimacy. Democratic instrumentalism is the view that democratic\ndecision-making procedures are at best a means for reaching just\noutcomes, and whether or not legitimacy requires democracy depends on\nthe outcomes that democratic decision-making brings about. Thomas\nChristiano (2004) helpfully distinguishes between monistic conceptions\nof political legitimacy and non-monistic ones. Democratic\ninstrumentalism is a monistic view. It reduces the normativity of\npolitical legitimacy to a single dimension: only the quality of the\noutcomes a particular political regime generates is relevant for\npolitical legitimacy. The contrasting position in contemporary\npolitical philosophy is that democratic forms of political\norganization are necessary for political legitimacy, independently of\ntheir instrumental value (Buchanan 2002). What conceptions of\ndemocratic legitimacy, as I use the term here, have in common is that\nthey demand that political institutions respect democratic values.\nSome such proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy are also\nmonistic. What is commonly called pure proceduralism is an example of\na monistic view. According to pure proceduralism only procedural\nfeatures of decision-making are relevant for democratic legitimacy.\nMany contributors are drawn to non-monistic conceptions of democratic\nlegitimacy. Such mixed conceptions of democratic legitimacy combine\nconditions that refer to the quality of outcomes of democratic\ndecision-making with conditions that apply to procedural features. \nDemocratic instrumentalism is sometimes used to argue against\ndemocracy. According to arguments of this kind, some ideal of good\noutcomes, however defined, forms the standard that determines\npolitical legitimacy. If democracy does not contribute to better\noutcomes than an alternative decision-making procedure, it is not\nnecessary for political legitimacy (Raz 1995; Wall 2007). \nThose who defend instrumentalism take it as a premise that there is an\nideal outcome that exists independently of the democratic process, and\nin terms of which the value of the democratic process, its legitimacy,\ncan be gauged. The instrumentalist accounts of Richard Arneson (2003)\nand Steven Wall (2007), for example, refer to some ideal egalitarian\ndistribution. In their view, the legitimacy of political institutions\nand the decisions made within them depends on how closely they\napproximate the ideal egalitarian distribution. If sacrificing\npolitical equality allows for a better approximation of equality\noverall, so their argument goes, then this does not undermine\nlegitimacy. \nOne problem with this view is that to get off the ground, it needs to\ntreat the value of political equality as less important than the value\nof those other equalities that inform the perfectionist standard. This\nis implausible to those who take political equality to be one of the\nmost important egalitarian values (e.g. Rawls 1993; Buchanan 2002;\nChristiano 2008; Kolodny 2014a,b). In addition, democratic\ninstrumentalism is at odds with the view that many democrats\nhold—that legitimate procedures of democratic decision-making\ncreate or constitute political authority. \nInstrumentalist defenses of democracy aim to show that democratic\ndecision-making procedures are best able to produce legitimate\noutcomes. The most famous version of this argument is based on the\nCondorcet jury theorem (for a recent discussion, see List and Goodin\n2001). In its original formulation, the Condorcet jury theorem assumes\nthat there are two alternatives and one of them is the correct\noutcome, however defined. Take the latter to be the legitimate\noutcome. The theorem says that if each voter is more likely to be\ncorrect than wrong, then a majority of all is also more likely to be\ncorrect than wrong. In addition, the probability that a majority will\nvote for the correct outcome increases with the size of the body of\nvoters. Since democracy has a greater constituency than any other\nregime, the theorem gives an argument for why democracy is best able\nto generate legitimate outcomes. In addition to arguments based on the\nCondorcet jury theorem, there are other attempts to defend the\ninstrumental epistemic value of democracy. Landemore (2012), for\nexample, offers an argument for the instrumental epistemic value of\ndemocracy that rests on the potential of decision-making mechanisms\nthat bring together diverse perspectives to outperform decision-making\nby less diverse groups, e.g. groups of experts. \nAccording to pure proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy,\ndemocratic decisions are legitimate as long as they are the result of\nan appropriately constrained process of democratic decision-making.\nThese views place all the normative weight on the value of the\ndemocratic procedure. \nThere are several ways in which pure proceduralism might be\nunderstood. On an account of aggregative democracy—which takes\nthe aggregation of individual preferences, for example through voting,\nto be the key feature of democracy—pure proceduralism implies\nthat democratic decisions are legitimate if the aggregative process is\nfair. Kenneth O. May’s defense of majority rule (May 1952)\nimplies a view of this sort (see also Dahl 1956). \nOn a deliberative account of democracy, legitimacy depends, at least\nin part, on the process of public deliberation (Manin 1987, Bohman\n1996). Thomas Christiano has a good characterization of what pure\nproceduralism entails in an account of deliberative democracy:\n“democratic discussion, deliberation, and decisionmaking under\ncertain conditions are what make the outcomes legitimate for each\nperson. … [W]hatever the results of discussions, deliberation,\nand decisionmaking …, they are legitimate. The results are made\nlegitimate by being the results of the procedure” (Christiano\n1996: 35). The idea is that while democratic deliberation helps\nsorting through reasons for and against particular candidates or\npolicy proposals, and perhaps even generates new alternatives, the\nlegitimacy of the outcomes of such a process only depends on the\nfairness of the decision-making process, not on the quality of the\noutcomes it produces. The justification for conceptions of democratic\nlegitimacy of this kind is that there is no shared standard for\nassessing the quality of the outcomes—deep disagreement about\nreasons for and against proposals will always remain. A fair way to\nresolve such disagreements is thus the only source of the legitimacy\nof the outcomes (Waldron 1996; Gaus 1997; Christiano 2008). \nEstlund (2008) has raised a challenge against fairness-based versions\nof democratic proceduralism. He points out that other decision-making\nprocedures—flipping a coin, for example—also satisfy a\nfairness requirement. An argument from fairness is thus insufficient\nto establish the superior legitimacy of democratic decision-making.\nPure proceduralists can respond to this challenge by pointing to the\ndistinctive fairness of democratic decision-making procedures.\nChristiano and Kolodny, for example, argue that the legitimacy of\ndemocratically made decisions stems from the kind of political\nequality that democracy, and only democracy, constitutes. According to\nChristiano (2008), only in a democracy are people publicly treated as\nequals. According to Kolodny (2014a, b), only a democracy offers the\nkind of equal opportunity to influence decision-making that avoids\nsubordinating some to the decisions of others. \nA different proceduralist reponse to Estlund’s challenge is to point\nto the procedural epistemic values that the democratic process\nrealizes—on how inclusive it is, for example, or how thoroughly\nthe knowledge claims on which particular proposals rest have been\nsubjected to criticism. The thought is that political legitimacy may\nbe jeopardized not just by unequal access to political, social and\neconomic institutions, but also by unjustified epistemic privilege.\nWhat Peter calls pure epistemic proceduralism is a conception of\ndemocratic legitimacy according to which political decisions are\nlegitimate if they are the outcome of a deliberative democratic\ndecision-making process that satisfies some conditions of political\nand epistemic fairness (Peter 2008; on procedural epistemic values,\nsee also Peter 2013). \nYet another response is to focus on the kind of freedom that democracy\noffers, rather than on egalitarian considerations. Pettit’s equal\ncontrol view, already mentioned in sections 1 and 3.3, rests on this\nstrategy. Pettit republican theory defends democracy as uniquely able\nto secure the non-domination of the citizens. \nRational proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy add\nconditions that refer to the quality of outcomes to those that apply\nto the procedural properties of democratic decision-making. While pure\nproceduralists argue that the inevitable contestedness of standards\nthat define the quality of outcomes makes it impossible to ground\nlegitimacy in them, defenders of mixed conceptions are concerned that\na fair process may lead to irrational outcomes—outcomes of\nunnecessarily and unacceptably low quality. The general thought\nunderlying rational proceduralist conceptions is that the fairness of\nthe democratic decision-making process is not sufficient to establish\nthe legitimacy of its outcomes. \nAs is the case with pure proceduralist conceptions, mixed conceptions\nof democratic legitimacy also vary with the underlying account of\ndemocracy. A version of rational proceduralism is implicit in\nArrow’s approach to aggregative democracy (Arrow 1963; see Peter\n2008 for a discussion). The problem he poses is: are there methods of\ndemocratic decision-making that are based on equal consideration of\nindividual interests and are conducive to rational social choice? As\nis well known, his impossibility theorem shows a problem with finding\nsuch decision-making mechanisms. Arrow’s way of posing the\nproblem—which contrasts with May’s (1952)—suggests\nthat the possible irrationality of majority rule undermines its\nlegitimacy, even if it respects certain procedural values. His view\nimplies that democratic legitimacy only obtains if the outcomes\nthemselves satisfy certain quality conditions—specifically, he\npostulated that they should satisfy certain rationality axioms. \nThe default conception of democratic legitimacy that many deliberative\ndemocrats favor is also a mixed conceptions. Habermas’\nconception of democratic legitimacy is an example. Drawing on\ndiscourse ethics, Habermas (1990; 1996) argues that people’s\nparticipation in the justificatory processes of deliberative democracy\nis necessary for political legitimacy. According to him, “the\nprocedures and communicative presuppositions of democratic opinion-\nand will-formation function as the most important sluices for the\ndiscursive rationalization of the decisions of an administration bound\nby law and statute” (1996: 300). The legitimacy of democratic\ndecisions, then, depends on both procedural values and on the\nsubstantive quality of the outcomes that these deliberative\ndecision-making procedures generate. As Habermas puts it:\n“Deliberative politics acquires its legitimating force from the\ndiscursive structure of an opinion- and will-formation that can\nfulfill its socially integrative function only because citizens expect\nits results to have a reasonable quality” (Habermas\n1996: 304; see also Benhabib 1994; Knight and Johnson 1994; Cohen\n1997a,b; Bohman 1997). In his view, only deliberative democratic\ndecision-making can produce a decision everyone has reasons to\nendorse. \nOther deliberative democrats, while still pegging the legitimacy of\ndemocratic decisions to features of both the procedure and its\noutcomes, are more skeptical about the ability of deliberative\nprocesses to reach an ideally justified decision (e.g. Gutmann and\nThompson 1996). A case in point is Philip Pettit’s and Christian\nList’s work on the discursive dilemma (e.g. Pettit 2001, 2003;\nList and Pettit 2002; List 2006). They show how occurrences of the\ndiscursive dilemma may undermine the rationality of the outcome of\npublic deliberation. This problem arises when the evaluation of\nalternative outcomes is logically connected to a set of independent\npremises. It is possible that the deliberative constellation is such\nthat a decision made based on the evaluation of the premises will\nproduce the opposite result than a decision based on the evaluation of\nthe outcomes directly. For example: while a majority might hold (P1)\nthat health is the most important good and there might also a be a\nmajority that holds (P2) that affordable health care is a good\nstrategy to secure people’s health, it is still possible that a\nmajority will reject a health care reform (C) which would improve\npeople’s health. This can happen if participants will only\nendorse the reform if they endorse both premises and if only a\nminority does so—even though there are majorities for each\npremise individually. \nThe potential irrationality of deliberative processes (see also\nSunstein 2003) is an important motivation for some democratic\ntheorists to take into account epistemic features of democratic\ndecision-making. Many advocates of epistemic democracy favor either an\ninstrumentalist or a mixed conception of legitimacy. As mentioned\nabove, some accounts of epistemic democracy draw on the Condorcet jury\ntheorem. Grofman and Feld (1988) interpret the Condorcet jury theorem\nas an explanation of Rousseau’s theory of how a democratic\ndecision reflects the general will. Such interpretations of epistemic\ndemocracy rely on what David Estlund calls “the correctness\ntheory of democratic legitimacy” (Estlund 2008: 99). According\nto this conception, a version of rational proceduralism, a democratic\ndecision is legitimate if it is correct.  \nEstlund’s own account of epistemic democracy puts forward a\ndifferent conception of legitimacy. His main objection is that\naccounts based on the Condorcet jury theorem fail to give a sufficient\nexplanation for why those who disagree with the outcome of the\ndemocratic decision-making process ought to treat it as binding and\nhence demand too much deference from the participants of democratic\ndecision-making. To correct for that, Estlund’s alternative\nconception of democratic legitimacy puts more emphasis on procedures.\nThe conception of legitimacy that he advocates “requires that\nthe procedure can be held, in terms acceptable to all qualified points\nof view, to be epistemically the best (or close to it) among those\nthat are better than random” (Estlund 2008: 98). He calls this\nconception “epistemic proceduralism”. He sometimes refers\nto it as a “purely” procedural conception of legitimacy\n(e.g. Estlund 2008: 108, 116). This is misleading, however, as pure\nproceduralist conceptions of legitimacy do not depend on\nprocedure-independent standards. In Estlund’s epistemic\nproceduralism, a procedure-independent standard functions as a\nselection device. His conception of legitimacy is thus better\ndescribed as a version of what Rawls calls imperfect proceduralism\n(Rawls 1971: 85). It assumes a procedure-independent standard for\ncorrect outcomes and defends a particular democratic procedure in\nterms of how closely it approximates these outcomes while allowing\nthat no procedure can guarantee that the right outcome is reached\nevery time. It is a feature of an imperfect proceduralist conception\nof democratic legitimacy that a particular decision may fail to reach\nthe ideal outcome—here, the correct outcome—yet still be\nlegitimate. To put the point differently, whereas pure proceduralist\nconceptions of democratic legitimacy are monistic about legitimacy,\nEstlund’s “epistemic proceduralism” is non-monistic,\nas it both insists that (deliberative) democratic procedures of\ndecision-making are essential for political legitimacy and requires\nthat these procedures approximate, as much as possible, an ideal\noutcome. \nPolitical cosmopolitanism is the view that national communities are\nnot the exclusive source of political legitimacy in the global realm.\nThis is a minimal characterization. It is compatible with a system in\nwhich nation states and their governments remain the main political\nagents, as long as there is some attribution of legitimate political\nauthority to international conventions. For even if states and their\ngovernments are the main political entities, there is still the\nquestion about appropriate relations among national actors. When\nshould nation states recognize another political entity as legitimate?\nAnd what are appropriate sanctions against entities that do not meet\nthe legitimacy criteria? Let us call this problem the problem of\ninternational legitimacy. \nPolitical cosmopolitanism is also compatible with the much more\ndemanding idea of replacing nation states and national\ngovernments—at least in certain policy areas—by global\ninstitutions. Examples of relevant policy areas are trade or the\nenvironment. The associated global institutions may include both\nglobal rules (e.g. the rules of the WTO treaty) and global political\nagents (e.g. the UN General Assembly). This raises the question of\nwhat conditions such global governance institutions have to satisfy in\norder to qualify as legitimate. Let us call this the problem of global\nlegitimacy. \nThe more familiar, contrasting position is political nationalism. It\nis the view that only the political institutions of nation states pose\nand can overcome the legitimacy problem and hence be a source of\npolitical legitimacy. Political nationalism is usually defended on the\ngrounds that there is something unique either about the coercion\ndeployed by states or about the political authority which states\npossess which needs justification. \nPolitical nationalism has had much influence on debates on global\njustice. Some have argued that because moral cosmopolitan commitments\ntrump commitments to (national) legitimacy, a conception of global\njustice can be detached from concerns with legitimacy (Beitz 1979a,b,\n1998; Pogge 2008). Others have argued—again assuming political\nnationalism—that legitimate authority at the level of the nation\nstate is necessary to pursue moral cosmopolitan goals (Ypi 2008\nprovides an empirical argument). Yet others have argued against the\nidea of global justice altogether, on the grounds that political\nlegitimacy ties obligations of justice to nation states (Blake 2001;\nNagel 2005). What these approaches to global justice have failed to\naddress is the possibility of sound political cosmopolitan conceptions\nof political legitimacy. Hassoun (2012) takes this issue as her\nstarting-point. She argues that the coercive power of global\ngovernance institutions raises a legitimacy problem of its own and,\nturning the arguments of Blake (2001) and Nagel (2005) on their heads,\nthat securing the legitimacy of those institutions entails obligations\nof global justice. \nThere are two main approaches to both international and global\nlegitimacy: the state-centered approach and the people-centered\napproach. The former takes appropriate relations among states as\nbasic. As Charles Beitz characterizes this approach:\n“international society is understood as domestic society writ\nlarge, with states playing the roles occupied by persons in domestic\nsociety. States, not persons, are the subjects of international\nmorality, and the rules that regulate their behavior are supposed to\npreserve a peaceful order of sovereign states” (1979b: 408; see\nalso Beitz 1998). Locke, Bentham, and Mill, among others, approached\nthe issue of international legitimacy in this way. Among contemporary\nthinkers, Michael Walzer (1977, 1980) defends a state-based—or\nas he calls it—community-based approach. The most important\ncriterion of international legitimacy that he proposes is the\ncriterion of non-interference. (For discussions of Walzer’s\nproposal, see Beitz 1979a, b). Others have put forward conceptions\nbased on state consent. Rawls advocates a conception based on the\nconsent of “well-ordered” (either “liberal” or\n“decent”) peoples (Rawls 1999; for critical discussions,\nsee e.g. Buchanan 2000; Wenar 2002; Cavallero 2003). \nThe second approach takes features of individuals—their\ninterests or their rights—as basic for legitimacy. At present,\nthe most comprehensive contemporary philosophical treatment of\ninternational legitimacy of this kind is probably Allen\nBuchanan’s Justice, Legitimacy, and Self-Determination\n(2003). As mentioned above (section 2.2.), Buchanan advocates a\nmoralized conception of legitimacy, according to which entities are\nlegitimate if they are morally justified to wield political power.\nSpecifically, political legitimacy requires that a minimal standard of\njustice is met. \nOn the basis of this moralized conception of legitimacy, Buchanan\nargues against the state-based conception and against state consent\ntheories of legitimacy in particular. State consent, Buchanan claims,\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for legitimacy. It is not\nsufficient because it is well-known that states tend to be the worst\nperpetrators in matters of human rights and there is thus need for an\nindependent international standard of minimal justice to obtain\nlegitimacy. It is not necessary, because international law recognizes\nmany obligations as binding even without the consent of acting\ngovernments. As long as these obligations are compatible with the\nminimal standard of justice, they are legitimate even if they have\narisen without state consent. \nBuchanan also rejects the idea that the source of a legitimacy deficit\nat the international level is the inequality among states. He does not\nbelieve that states need to have equal weight in international\ninstitutions. What he regards as the main problem of legitimacy at the\ninternational level is, instead, that “a technocratic elite,\nlacking in democratic accountability to individuals and nonstate\ngroups, is playing an increasingly powerful role in a system of\nregional and global governance” (2003: 289). The more efficient\nremedy for this problem, he argues, is protecting basic human rights\nand improving democratic accountability. \nBuchanan uses his conception of legitimacy to answer the question when\na political entity—as formed, for example, by secession or by\nunion—should be recognized as legitimate. He lists three\ncriteria (Buchanan 2003: 266ff). The first is a “minimal\ninternal justice requirement”. It specifies how political\nentities should treat those upon whom it wields political power.\nSpecifically, it requires that basic human rights are protected. This\nrequirement includes a demand for minimal democracy. But not all\npolitical entities that satisfy this requirement deserve to be\nrecognized as legitimate. They also need to be formed in the right\nway. The second criterion is thus a criterion of procedural justice\nand requires that a political entity has not come about through\nusurpation (“nonusurpation requirement”). Finally, there\nis a “minimal external justice requirement”. It contains\nconditions about how political entities should interact with one\nanother. \nNäsström (2007) uses the people-centered approach to push against\nthe tendency to associate state legitimacy with the legitimacy of\ngovernments. The more fundamental question, she argues, is what makes\nthe constitution of a people legitimate. And it would be a mistake to\nthink that the constitution of a people is a historical issue or an\nempirical given. What makes the constitution of a people legitimate is\na normative question in its own right that must be asked before we can\nask about the legitimacy of the government of a people. \nThe question Näsström articulates, which is also discussed in the\nliterature on the constitution of the demos (Goodin 2007), is\nimportant for the debate on the ethics of immigration. What is the\nscope for legitimate border controls? Do states have a unilateral\nright to control their borders or do potential immigrants have a right\nto participate in the determination of immigration policies? Abizadeh\n(2008) has argued, on the basis of the claim that the constitution of\nthe demos is not a historical given, that a commitment to a democratic\ntheory of domestic political legitimacy implies that one ought to\nreject the unilateral domestic right to control and close the\nstate’s boundaries. His key claim is that state borders are coercive\nto potential immigrants. In light of this, and because, in a\ndemocracy, the exercise of coercive political power requires some form\nof democratic justification, he concludes that both citizens and\nforeigners should have say in the determination of border policies.\n(See Miller 2008 for a critical discussion of this argument.) \nConceptions of global legitimacy broaden the scope of legitimate\nauthority to global governance institutions. One of the precursors of\nglobal legitimacy is Kant. Kant is often read as advocating a\nconception of international legitimacy based on a loose “league\nof nations”—especially in Perpetual Peace. But\nSharon Byrd and Joachim Hruschka (2008) argue that Kant, especially in\nThe Doctrine of Right, can also be read as favoring, a\n“state of nation states” as the right approach to global\nlegitimacy. This conception, while stopping short of requiring a\nsingle world state, confers more coercive political power to the\nglobal level than the league of nations, which essentially leaves\nuntouched the sovereignty of nation states. \nThe philosophical literature on global legitimacy is very much work in\nprogress. But most proposals favor a multilevel system of governance\nin which global legitimacy is to be achieved through an appropriate\ndivision of labor between nation states and issue-specific global\ngovernance institutions (e.g. Caney 2006; Valentini 2012). \nAny successful theory of global legitimacy has to cover the following\nthree issues. First, what are global governance institutions and in\nwhat ways can and should they be thought of as taking over roles from\nstates or their governments? This is a question about the subject of\nglobal legitimacy (Hurrell and MacDonald 2012). Second, what is the\nlegitimacy problem that such governance institutions face? And, third,\nhow can they solve this problem of legitimacy and what are legitimacy\ncriteria that apply to them? How, if at all, do these criteria differ\nfrom those that apply at the level of nation states? \nIn response to the first question, Buchanan and Keohane (2006) argue\nthat global governance institutions such as the WTO or the IMF\n“are like governments in that they issue rules and publicly\nattach significant consequences to compliance or failure to comply\nwith them—and claim authority to do so” (Buchanan and\nKeohane 2006: 406). These institutions are set up to handle certain\nissues in similar fashion as national political agencies would. Just\nlike national political institutions, they are coordination devices.\nOnly they are created to solve problems that arise at the global\nlevel. \nJoshua Cohen and Charles Sabel (2005) have a slightly broader account\nof global governance institutions—one that is not limited to\nthem being coordination devices, but that emphasizes coercion instead.\nAccording to Cohen and Sabel 2005: 765), “[t]o a substantial and\ngrowing extent … rulemaking directly affecting the freedom of\naction of individuals, firms, and nation states (and the making of\nrules to regulate this rulemaking) is taking place … in global\nsettings created by the world’s nations but no longer under\ntheir effective control.” In their answer to the second\nquestion, they relate the legitimacy problem of global governance\ninstitutions to the absence of political authority, understood as\nlegitimate exercises of coercive political power, at the global level.\nTo overcome this problem, they argue, new modes of governance must be\ncreated, with their own structures of accountability. These structures\nare necessary to properly deal with the coercive power that these\ninstitutions exercise.  \nBuchanan and Keohane agree that the attempt to rule without legitimacy\nis an unjustified exercise of power. They also argue that the attempt\nto rule without legitimacy raises not only a normative problem, but\nhas direct practical consequences, as institutions that appear\nunjustified will not be effective. The problem of legitimacy that\nglobal governance institutions face is that even when there is\nwidespread agreement that global institutions that can take on the\nrole of co-ordination devices are necessary, there will be widespread\ndisagreement about which particular institutions are necessary and\nwhat rules they should issue (Buchanan and Keohane 2006: 408ff). \nIn answer to the third question, Buchanan and Keohane (2006) propose a\nmoralized conception of legitimacy: legitimacy “is the right to\nrule, understood to mean both that institutional agents are morally\njustified in making rules and attempting to secure compliance with\nthem and that people subject to those rules have moral,\ncontent-independent reasons to follow them and/or to not interfere\nwith others’ compliance with them” (2006: 411).\nSubstantively, they propose that an institution is morally justified\nin this way if it does not contribute to grave injustices\n(“minimal moral acceptability”), if there is no obvious\nalternative that would perform better (“comparative\nbenefit”), and if it respects its own guidelines and procedures\n(“institutional integrity”) (Buchanan and Keohane 2006:\n419ff). \nAn important question for political cosmopolitanism is to what extent\ninternational and global legitimacy require democracy—either at\nthe level of national states and governments or at the level of global\ngovernance institutions. Many writers on the subject have tended to\ntake a cautiously positive stance on this issue (e.g. Beitz, 1979,\n1998; Held 1995, 2002; Buchanan 2003; Buchanan and Keohane 2006). An\nexception is Rawls in The Law of Peoples, however,\nwho advocates a conception of international legitimacy that demands\nthat peoples and their states are well-ordered, but does not associate\nwell-orderedness with democracy. \nThere are two worries that tend to underlie the cautious attitude. One\nis feasibility: it is often argued that democracy at the international\nlevel, let alone at the level of global governance institutions, is\nutopian and cannot be realized. The second worry is of a moral nature:\ndemocracy should not be imposed on people and peoples who endorse a\ndifferent set of values (see Valentini 2014 for a discussion).  \nIn response to the second worry, Christiano (2015) argues that a human\nright to democracy is compatible with a right to self-determination\nand that, properly understood, the right to self-determination\npresupposes the human right to democracy. Christiano’s work offers\nthe most comprehensive defense of a human right to democracy at the\ndomestic level (Christiano 2011; 2015). Christiano’s instrumental\nargument aims to show that democracies offer better protection of a\nrange of human rights than non-democracies. His intrinsic argument for\na human right to democracy builds on an argument discussed earlier\n(section 4.2), namely that democracies are uniquely able to realize\nthe value of publicly treating people as equals. \nCohen and Sabel (2005) seek to rescue an ideal of global democracy\nfrom more skeptical tendencies in the literature. They respond to\nthese considerations by advocating a notion of global democracy that\nemphasizes the deliberative aspect. Granting to skeptics that\ndemocratic decision-making mechanisms might be problematic for both\nfeasibility reasons and moral reasons, they argue that some form of\ndeliberation is primarily what is needed to address the legitimacy\ndeficit that global governance institutions face (see also Appiah\n2006; List and Koenig-Archibugi 2010).","contact.mail":"f.peter@warwick.ac.uk","contact.domain":"warwick.ac.uk"}]
