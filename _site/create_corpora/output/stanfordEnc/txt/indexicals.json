For example, the\nindexical ‘you’ may refer to one person in one context and\nto another person in another context. Other paradigmatic examples of\nindexicals are ‘I’, ‘here’,\n‘today’, ‘yesterday’, ‘he’,\n‘she’, and ‘that’. Two speakers who utter a\nsingle sentence that contains an indexical may say different\nthings. For instance, when both John and Mary utter ‘I am\nhungry’, Mary says that she is hungry, whereas John says that he\nis hungry. Many philosophers hold that indexicals have two sorts of\nmeaning. The first sort of meaning is often called ‘linguistic\nmeaning’ or ‘character’ (the latter term is due to\nDavid Kaplan, 1989a). The second sort of meaning is often called\n‘content’. Using this terminology, we can say that every\nindexical has a single unvarying character, but may vary in content\nfrom context to context.\n\n\n\nPhilosophers have several reasons for being interested in\nindexicals. First, some wish to describe their meanings and fit them\ninto a general semantic theory. Second, some wish to understand the\nlogic of arguments containing indexicals, such as Descartes’s\nCogito argument. Third, some think that reflection on\nindexicals may give them some insight into the nature of belief,\nself-knowledge, first-person perspective, consciousness, and other\nimportant philosophical matters.\n\n\n\nThe indexicals that philosophers have studied most are the pronouns\n‘I’, ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’,\n‘this’, and ‘that’; the adverbs\n‘here’, ‘now’, ‘today’,\n‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’, and\n‘actually’; and the adjectives ‘my’,\n‘his’, ‘her’, ‘present’,\n‘past’, and ‘actual’. The items on this list\ncome mostly from David Kaplan’s influential work on indexicals,\nDemonstratives (Kaplan 1989a). \n\nIndexicals are commonly called context-sensitive\nexpressions (or context-dependent expressions) but the\ntwo terms tend to be used differently. The term ‘indexical’\ntends to be restricted to simple expressions, such as ‘I’\nand ‘today’. The term ‘context-sensitive’,\nhowever, is commonly applied both to simple indexicals and to complex\nexpressions that contain simple indexicals, for example, the definite\ndescription ‘the dog she is looking at’, the verb phrase\n‘sat next to me’, and the sentence ‘He is\nstanding’. \n\nThe rough characterization of indexicals in the first sentence of\nthis article might be rejected by some theorists, for it relies on the\nnotion of a linguistic expression (such as ‘you’)\nvarying in reference, and content, among contexts. But some\ntheorists instead describe indexicality in terms of expressions varying\nin reference or content relative to utterances or other sorts\nof speech acts, such as assertions. Other theorists speak of\nutterances or tokens varying in reference or content,\nwithout any relativization to context or speech act. Some theorists\nspeak several ways. The differences may be theoretically significant,\nand more will be said about them below. In addition, some philosophers\nwould prefer to speak entirely about shifts in extension, rather than\nshifts in reference, from context to context. Some theorists, for\ninstance, hold that ‘you’ is not a singular term that\nrefers to an individual in a context. Rather, it is a quantifier\nphrase, and so its extension, in a context, is not an individual, but\nrather a certain sort of set. (See section 5.2 below for an analogous\nview of complex demonstratives.) Such a theorist may also wish to use\nthe term ‘reference’ only for expressions whose extensions\nare individuals. This article, however, will use\n‘reference’ and ‘extension’ more-or-less\ninterchangeably. On this use of ‘reference’, the word\n‘you’ varies in reference from context to context, even if\nit is a quantifier phrase whose extension, in a context, is not an\nindividual, but a set. \n\nIndexicality should be distinguished from ambiguity.\nAmbiguous simple expressions, such as ‘bank’ and\n‘bat’, have a fixed, limited number of different meanings\ndetermined by linguistic convention. Indexicals, by contrast, seem to\nhave a single linguistic meaning that is fixed by linguistic\nconvention, but also another sort of meaning (content) that varies from\noccasion to occasion, or context to context. For instance, it seems that\n‘you’ has a single meaning fixed by linguistic convention,\nand it is because of this fixed linguistic meaning that the sentence\n‘You are hungry’ can have a virtually unlimited number of\ncontents, in different contexts. \n\nSome of the expressions in the earlier list of indexicals have both\nindexical and non-indexical uses. In particular, the pronouns\n‘he’, ‘she’, ‘his’, and\n‘hers’ appear to have three different types of use:\nindexical uses (sometimes called deictic or\ndemonstrative uses), bound variable uses, and\nunbound anaphoric uses (Kaplan 1989a, pp. 489–90; Partee\n1989). \n\nThe pronouns in (1)–(2) would typically be used as indexicals in\nutterances of (1)–(2) that are accompanied by pointing gestures. \n\nWhen used demonstratively, the extensions and contents of\n‘he’, ‘her’, and sentences (1) and (2) can vary\nfrom context to context, depending in some way on the speaker’s\ndemonstrations or referential intentions or other contextual\nfactors. \n\nBy contrast, the occurrence of ‘he’ and\n‘her’ in (3) and (4), on the relevant ways of understanding\nthem, function like occurrences of variables bound by quantifier\nphrases. \n\nConsequently, we could reasonably symbolize (3) and (4) with (5) and\n(6) below. \n\nThe contents of (5) and (6) do not vary from context to context (or\nat least do not do so in virtue of the occurrences of the\npronouns). \n\nFinally, these same pronouns are also sometimes used as unbound\nanaphors. That is, some occurrences seem not to be used\ndemonstratively, and not to be within the scope of prior explicit\nquantifier phrases or other binding linguistic expressions, and yet\nseem to depend for their interpretation on prior occurrences of\nlinguistic expressions. (See the entries on \n anaphora and \n discourse representation theory.) \nFor example, ‘he’ appears to be used as an unbound anaphor\nin discourse (7) and ‘she’ seems to be so used in (8). \n\nThese three uses of pronouns seem quite different. Consequently,\nKaplan (1989b, p. 572) sometimes says that ‘he’ is\nlexically ambiguous, and that the demonstrative ‘he’ and\nthe anaphoric ‘he’ are homonymous expressions (Kaplan\n1989b, p. 593). Most theorists, however, do not hold that these\npronouns are ambiguous or that these uses involve distinct homonymous\nwords. Many theorists who work on demonstratives and anaphora\nemphasize their similarities to variables. For demonstratives and\nvariables, see Heim and Kratzer 1998, chapter 9; for anaphora and\nvariables, see Kamp and Reyle 1993, Chierchia 1992, and Salmon\n2006. For related discussion, see Partee (1989), Condoravdi and Gawron\n(1996), and Neale (2005). \n\nFor the rest of this article, we concentrate exclusively on\ndemonstrative uses of the above pronouns. \n\nVarious theorists classify indexicals into types, depending\n(roughly) on how their references and contents are determined in a\ncontext. Kaplan (1989a), for instance, distinguishes between pure\nindexicals and true demonstratives. The pure indexicals,\nhe says, include ‘I’, ‘today’,\n‘tomorrow’, ‘actual’, ‘present’,\n‘here’, and ‘now’. The true demonstratives\ninclude ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘his’,\n‘her’, and ‘that’. Kaplan claims that the\nreference and content of a true demonstrative, in a context, depends\n(roughly) on the speaker’s accompanying demonstrations or\nintentions. For example, Kaplan says that the reference and content of\n‘that’ in a context is determined (in part) by the\nspeaker’s pointing gestures or by the speaker’s intention\nto refer to a particular object. The reference and content of a pure\nindexical does not. For example, the reference of ‘I’ in a\ncontext is always the speaker, whether or not she points at herself,\nand the reference of ‘tomorrow’ is always the day after the\nday of the context, no matter which day the speaker intends to refer\nto. \n\nJohn Perry (1997; 2001, pp. 58–62) makes a closely related\ndistinction between automatic and discretionary\nindexicals. Automatic indexicals include ‘I’ and\n‘tomorrow’; Perry says they are indexicals whose references\nare determined by their linguistic meanings and public\ncontextual facts, such as the speaker and the day of utterance;\nintentions (other than the intention to use the indexical with its\nusual meaning) are irrelevant. Discretionary indexicals include\n‘he’, ‘she’, ‘that’, and\n‘this man’; they depend for reference on speakers’\nintentions. Perry also makes an orthogonal distinction between\nnarrow and wide indexicals. Narrow indexicals are\nthose whose references are determined by narrow contexts,\nwhere narrow contexts include only a speaker, a time, and a location.\nWide contexts include other facts, such as speakers’ intentions,\nassumptions made by conversational participants, and so on. The\nexpressions that Kaplan calls ‘true demonstratives’ Perry\nwould call ‘wide discretionary indexicals’. \n\nVarious complications arise in categorizing indexicals as pure\nindexicals and true demonstratives, or as automatic and discretionary.\nKaplan (1989) classifies ‘here’ and ‘now’ as\npure indexicals, though he thinks that the temporal and spatial extents\nof their extensions depend on speakers’ intentions (Kaplan 1989a,\n419, n.12). Perry (1997, 2001) thinks that this sort of variation\njustifies classifying them as discretionary rather than automatic.\nOther indexicals may raise similar issues. For example,\n‘today’ may initially appear to be an automatic indexical\nin Perry’s sense, but sometimes it is seemingly used to refer to\ntemporal periods longer than a single day, as in ‘Today we ride\nin automobiles rather than in horse-drawn carriages’. For further\ndiscussion of these distinctions, and their viability, see Mount\n(2008). \n\nMany theorists accept a distinction between true demonstratives and\npure indexicals, or some similar distinction, such as Perry’s\ndistinction between automatic and discretionary indexicals. Thus\nmany think that true demonstratives (from here on, simply\ndemonstratives) require something more than pure indexicals to\nacquire a reference and content. The nature of this “extra\nsomething” is controversial, but two widely discussed candidates\nare demonstrations (or pointing gestures) and\nspeakers’ intentions. \n\nIn his 1989a, Kaplan emphasizes the role of pointing gestures in\nfixing the reference (and content) of a demonstrative. More precisely,\nhe says that the reference of a demonstrative in a context is fixed by\na demonstration, which he describes as “typically,\nthough not invariably, a (visual) presentation of a local object\ndiscriminated by a pointing.” (1989a, p. 490). Kaplan changes his\nmind in his 1989b. He there states that he had always thought that a\ndemonstration is “typically directed by the speaker’s\nintention to point at a perceived individual on whom he has\nfocused.” He then calls such intentions directing\nintentions and says that he has come to “regard the\ndirecting intention, at least in the case of perceptual demonstratives,\nas criterial, and to regard the demonstration as a mere\nexternalization of this inner intention.” (1989b,\np. 582) \n\nOther theorists have proposed other accounts. Michael Devitt (1981)\nsays that the referent of an utterance of ‘that’ is the\nitem that stands in a certain causal relation to the utterance. Colin\nMcGinn (1981) proposes that the referent of an utterance of ‘that\n\\(F\\)’ is the first \\(F\\) to intersect the line\nprojected from the speaker’s pointing finger. Howard Wettstein\n(1984) says that the reference of ‘that’ is determined by\nthe cues that a competent and attentive addressee would reasonably take\nthe speaker to be exploiting. Marga Reimer (1991a, 199b) argues that\ndemonstrative utterances can refer to objects that are not the targets\nof the speaker’s directing intentions, contrary to what she takes\nKaplan (1989b) to be arguing. Kent Bach (1992a, 1992b) claims that the\nobject to which a speaker refers with a demonstrative is fixed by\ncertain of the speaker’s communicative intentions. Perry (2009,\np. 60) argues that the referent of an utterance of a demonstrative is\nthe object of a directing intention, and offers a rather elaborate\ntheory of directing intentions that is inspired by some brief remarks\nfrom Kaplan. Jeffrey King (2012) argues that the semantic value of a\ndemonstrative in a context is the object such that (a) the speaker\nintends it to be the demonstrative’s semantic value and (b) an\nattentive hearer would take it to be the speaker’s intended\nsemantic value. \n\nOne prima facie problem for demonstration-theories is that\ndemonstratives sometimes refer in contexts in which the speaker does\nnot produce a pointing gesture. If ‘here’ and\n‘now’ are true demonstratives, or discretionary indexicals,\nthen they may present a particular difficulty for\ndemonstration-theories, for pointing gestures often seem irrelevant to\ndetermining their referents and contents in contexts. One prima\nfacie problem for intention-theorists is that speakers typically\nhave many intentions when they use demonstratives, and these intentions\nmay conflict (Bach 1992a, 1992b; Perry 1997, 2001 p. 60, 2009; King\n2013). For example, a speaker who utters ‘he’ may intend to\nspeak about Joe, about the man that she sees, about the man that others\nare referring to, and about the man at whom she is pointing. The\nspeaker may think these are the same person when they are not. \n\nNearly all semantic theorists would agree that the list of simple\nindexicals given in section 1.1 is incomplete. Nearly all would agree\nthat a more complete list includes the plural terms ‘we’,\n‘us’, ‘ours’, ‘they’,\n‘them’, ‘theirs’, ‘these’ and\n‘those’, and most would be willing to add the adjective\n‘current’ and the adverbs ‘then’,\n‘presently’, ‘currently’, and\n‘there’. Many theorists have proposed further additions to\nthe list of simple indexicals, but these additions are\ncontroversial. \n\nA semantic theory that says that an expression is context-sensitive,\nor is an indexical expression, is a contextualist theory of\nthat expression. A theory that says that an expression is\ncontext-insensitive is an invariantist theory. Below\nis a list of types of expressions for which contextualist theories have\nbeen proposed, along with some discussion. \n\nTense Some theorists hold that sentences containing verbs\nin the present tense vary not only in truth-value from time to time,\nbut also in content, from context to context. For example, some hold\nthat the content of ‘Fred is hungry’ at a context whose\nassociated time is \\(t\\) is (roughly) that Fred be hungry at\n\\(t\\). The variation in content is said to be due to the\noccurrence of ‘is’, which is context-sensitive. More\ngenerally, tense markers and tense morphology are claimed to be\ncontext-sensitive expressions. See Reichenbach 1947, Partee 1973, Enç\n1987, Salmon 1989, Ogihara 1996, and King 2003. \n\nModals Paradigmatic modal terms include\n‘necessary’ and ‘necessarily’,\n‘possible’ and ‘possibly’,\n‘contingent’ and ‘contingently’,\n‘must’, ‘might’, ‘could’,\n‘may’, ‘can’, and ‘able’. Some\ntheorists would include many more expressions (Portner 2009). Speakers\nwho utter a modal may mean different sorts of modality on different\noccasions. Examples: (a) Someone who utters ‘Sue can go to the\nparty’ may mean (roughly) that her going to the party is\nconsistent with her plans (practical\nor circumstantial possibility) or instead that her going is\n(merely) consistent with the laws of nature (nomological\npossibility).  (b) If Jill utters ‘Joe might have been in London\nthis morning’, she may mean that Joe’s being in London is\nconsistent with her knowledge, whereas if Bill utters that same\nsentence, he may mean that Joe’s being in London is consistent\nwith his (Bill’s) knowledge. In both cases, epistemic\npossibility is involved. (c) If Susan utters ‘Alice might have\nrun three miles’, she might mean that Alice’s having run\nthree miles is consistent with Alice’s metaphysical essence\n(metaphysical possibility) or that Alice’s having run\nis consistent with her (Susan’s) knowledge. (d) Someone who\nutters ‘Mary may go to school’ may mean that her going to\nschool is morally permissible or instead that it is legally\npermissible. In both cases, a variety of deontic possibility\nis involved. Many theorists attribute the preceding sorts of variation\nto context-sensitivity in the relevant modals. Those who think that\nmodals are semantically like quantifiers over possible worlds\ntypically hold that the content of a modal, in a context, is the same\nas a restricted quantifier over possible worlds, where the relevant\nrestriction varies from context to context. See Kratzer 1977, 2012;\nand Lewis 1979b. \n\nGradable Adjectives Paradigm examples of gradable adjectives\nare ‘tall’, ‘old’, ‘rich’,\n‘fast’, ‘smart’, and ‘hot’. They\nare called ‘gradable’ because they can be felicitously\nmodified with adverbs such as ‘fairly’ and\n‘very’. Suppose that Susan is both a professional\nphilosopher and a professional basketball player. A speaker who utters\n‘Susan is tall’ might use ‘tall’ to mean (very\nroughly) tall for a philosopher. That same speaker, on\nanother occasion, might utter ‘Susan is not tall’ and use\n‘not tall’ to mean (roughly) not tall for a basketball\nplayer. Some theorists explain the variability by holding that\ngradable adjectives are context-sensitive. See Kennedy 2007. \n\nAdjectives and Nouns that Optionally Take Complements\nParadigm examples of adjectives of this sort are ‘ready’,\n‘late’, ‘relevant’, ‘local’, and\n‘eligible’, and paradigm examples of nouns of this sort are\n‘neighbor’ and ‘enemy’. A speaker who utters\n‘Tipper is ready’ typically means that Tipper is ready for\n\\(X\\), where \\(X\\) is some event or activity the speaker has\nin mind. In one context, a speaker might mean that Tipper is ready to\nwork; in another context, he might mean that Tipper is ready for a\ncertain party. Therefore, some theorists hold that ‘ready’\nis context-sensitive. Somewhat similarly, a speaker who utters\n‘Smith is a neighbor’ may mean that Smith is a neighbor of\nhis (the speaker’s) or that Smith is a neighbor of someone else (say,\nJones). Again, it may be claimed that ‘neighbor’ is\ncontext-sensitive. See Partee 1989, Condoravdi and Gawron 1996,\nBach 2005, Gauker 2012. \n\n‘Know’ Speakers in some contexts may judge that\nthe sentence ‘John knows that the bank will be open on\nSaturday’ is true. Speakers in other contexts who are aware of\nthe same facts about John may, at the same time, judge that this same\nsentence is false. Consequently some philosophers hold that\n‘know’ has different contents in different contexts,\ndepending on the standards of justification that speakers of the\ncontext take for granted, or depending on the epistemic alternatives\nthat are salient to the speakers of that context. See Cohen 1988,\nDeRose 1995, Lewis 1996, and the entry on \n epistemic contextualism. \n\nQuantifier phrases Examples of quantifiers are\n‘every’, ‘all’, ‘some’,\n‘no’, ‘most’, ‘many’, and\n‘few’. Quantifier phrases are (roughly) noun\nphrases or determiner phrases that include both a quantifier and a\ncommon noun or noun phrase, for example, ‘every student’,\n‘some dog’, and ‘no black cats’. Two speakers\nwho utter the same sentence containing a quantifier phrase may mean\ndifferent things. If Smith is teaching a class of first-graders and\nutters ‘Every student has a pencil’, he means something\nlike every student in Smith’s first-grade class has a\npencil’. If Jones is proctoring a multiple-choice exam in a\nlarge college course, and utters that same sentence, then she means\nsomething like every student taking exam E has a pencil,\nwhere \\(E\\) is the relevant exam.  This phenomenon is often\ncalled quantifier-domain restriction.  Some theorists propose\nto explain this variation by hypothesizing that quantifier phrases are\ncontext-sensitive. See von Fintel 1994, Stanley and Szabo 2000. \n\nTheorists have proposed contextualist theories for many other\nexpressions, including: Conditionals (Lewis 1973, Kratzer 2012,\n and the entry on \n conditionals); deontic terms, such as ‘ought’ and\n‘should’ (Lewis 1973, Kratzer 2012, Portner 2009);\nperspectival expressions, such as ‘come’, ‘go’,\n‘left’, ‘right’, and ‘behind’\n(Lewis 1979b); weather predicates, such as ‘rain’ and\n‘hot’ (see Sennett 2008 for an overview); propositional\nattitude verbs, such as ‘believe’ (Richard 1990,\nand the entry on \n propositional attitude reports); common nouns, such as\n‘student’ and ‘table’ (Stanley and Szabo 2000);\nand vague expressions, which include nearly all expressions in natural\nlanguages (Raffman 1996, Soames 1999, Fara 2000, \nand the entry on \n vagueness). \n\nIf the above expressions are indexicals, then their contents seem to\ndepend (at least in part) on speakers’ intentions. They are not,\nhowever, appropriately called ‘true demonstratives’, for\npointing gestures seem completely irrelevant to fixing their contents\nand references. Perry’s term ‘discretionary\nindexical’ would be more apt. \n\nContextualist theories for an expression should be distinguished\nfrom invariantist theories that hypothesize hidden indexicals.\nOn views of the latter sort, the expression itself is\ncontext-insensitive, but its occurrences are (often)\naccompanied by occurrences of an unpronounced expression that is\ncontext-sensitive. These context-sensitive expressions are sometimes\nsaid to be, or to resemble, indexicals, pronouns, or variables. For\nillustration, consider the gradable adjective ‘rich’. A\nstrict contextualist theory would claim that this adjective is\na unary predicate whose content in any context is a unary\nproperty. In some contexts, the content of ‘rich’ is\n(roughly) the property of being rich for a philosopher, while in others\nits content is the property of being rich for the CEO of a large\ncompany. By contrast, an invariantist theory with hidden\nindexicals for ‘rich’ would claim that the content of\n‘rich’ does not vary from context to context: its content,\nin every context, is the same binary relation, roughly\nrich for, that can hold between a person and (roughly) a\nproperty. Sometimes the predicate ‘rich’ appears in\nsentences in which it has two (linguistic) arguments, as in\n‘George is rich for a philosopher’. But in sentences in\nwhich there is no pronounced second argument, as in\n‘George is rich’, the predicate ‘rich’ is\naccompanied by an unpronounced occurrence of a context-sensitive\nexpression that resembles a pronoun. In some contexts, the content of\nthe hidden indexical is the property of being a philosopher and in\nothers it is the property of being a CEO of a large company. See Partee\n(1989), Condoravdi and Gawron (1996), Stanley and Szabo 2000. \n\nA third type of theory for ‘rich’ is an invariantist\ntheory with unarticulated constituents (Perry 2000, Chapter\n10). On such views, ‘rich’ is a binary predicate whose\ncontent in all contexts is the previously mentioned binary relation\nrich for, but the word is never accompanied by a hidden\nindexical. Thus the content of the sentence ‘George is\nrich’, in all contexts, is less than fully propositional.\nHowever, according to some views of this sort, a speaker who utters\nthat sentence typically asserts a full proposition, such as the\nproposition that George is rich for a philosopher. For discussion, see\nBach 1994, 2005. \n\nSome theorists , as we have seen, hold that indexicality extends far\nbeyond Kaplan’s list, and pervades natural language. Others deny\nthis. Many opponents of pervasive context-sensitivity rely heavily on\npragmatics and speech act theory to explain away the phenomena that\nothers take to be evidence for pervasive context-sensitivity. For\nexample, Bach (2001) and Soames (2009) argue that quantifier phrases\nare context-insensitive. The content of ‘every\nstudent’, in all contexts, quantifies over absolutely all\nstudents. So, the content ‘Every student has a pencil’, in\nall contexts, is equivalent to the content of ‘Every student\nin the entire universe has a pencil’. But Bach and\nSoames say that speakers who utter that sentence almost always\nmean, convey, or assert a proposition other\nthan the content of the sentence. When Smith utters ‘Every\nstudent has a pencil’ he asserts or means that every student\nin Smith’s first-grade class has a pencil (or some\nsimilar proposition), though this is not the content of the sentence in\nhis context. Cappelen and Lepore (2005) similarly hold that\n‘tall’ is context-insensitive. The content of ‘Mary\nis tall’, in every context, is simply the proposition that Mary\nis tall, with no relativization to a property (or scale or comparison\nclass). However, a speaker who utters that sentence usually asserts or\nmeans a richer proposition, such as that Mary is tall for a\nphilosopher. For discussions of related views, see Bach 1994,\nCarston 2002, Borg 2007, Recanati 2004, Gauker 2012, Braun 2012. \n\nOther theorists resist pervasive context-sensitivity by appealing to\nshiftiness in extension without shiftiness in content. To obtain\nshiftiness in extension without shiftiness in content, these theorists\nrelativize extensions of expressions to non-traditional\nparameters. Such views are often called relativist. For\nexample, Egan, Hawthorne, and Weatherson (2005) and MacFarlane (2011)\nargue for relativist theories of epistemic uses of ‘might’.\nOn their views, ‘Susan might be in Boston’, when used\nepistemically, has the same content in all contexts, but the\ntruth-value of this content varies not only from one possible world to\nanother, but also from one body of knowledge to another within a single\npossible world. Lasersohn (2005) similarly argues that predicates of\npersonal taste, such as ‘tasty’ and ‘fun’, do\nnot vary in content from context to context, but do vary in extension\nwith respect to judges, or standards of taste, within\na single world. See also Stephenson 2007, Richard 2008, Cappelen and\nHawthorne 2009. \n\nGiven the disagreements about the context-sensitivity of various\nexpressions, one might wonder whether there is a reliable test\nfor context-sensitivity. In practice, many philosophers seem to employ\nthe following tests. \n\nSentence \\(S\\) is context-sensitive iff it is possible for\nthere to be two speakers who utter \\(S\\) (at the same time) and\nsay different things. \n\nSentence \\(S\\) is context-sensitive iff it is possible for\nthere to be a speaker who utters \\(S\\) and another speaker who\nutters the negation of \\(S\\) (at the same time), and yet the speakers do\nnot contradict each other. \n\nSentences that contain paradigm indexicals pass these tests. But\nsome opponents of pervasive context-sensitivity would reject them. For\ninstance, Soames and Bach might admit that Smith and Jones say\ndifferent things when they utter ‘Every student has a\npencil’, but they would not attribute this variation to the\nalleged context-sensitivity of the sentence and its quantifier phrase.\nRather, they would claim that Smith and Jones can use the sentence to\nsay, or assert, propositions that are distinct from the\nsentence’s constant content. \n\nAnother test for context-sensitivity uses attitude ascriptions\n(Cappelen and Lepore 2005). Paradigmatic indexicals behave differently\nfrom non-indexicals in attitude ascriptions. Consider the following\nutterances. \n\nJones disquotes Smith in both of these cases: that is,\nJones utters a says-that ascription whose embedded clause contains the\nvery sentence that Smith utters. But Jones’s says-ascription in\n(9) is true (in Jones’s context), whereas Jones’s\nsays-ascriptions in (10) is false (in Jones’s context). So,\ndisquotation can fail when the subject of the ascription utters a\ncontext-sensitive sentence. Thus, Cappelen and Lepore propose roughly\nthe following test for context-sensitivity. \n\n\\(S\\) is context-sensitive iff: it is possible that [(i)\n\\(A\\) utters sentence \\(S\\) and yet (ii) “\\(A\\)\nsaid that \\(S\\)” is false in some context]. \n\nIf this test is accepted, then it could be used to argue against the\ncontext-sensitivity of many simple expressions that do not appear on\nKaplan’s list. Consider, for instance, the gradable adjective\n‘rich’. At first glance the following seems impossible:\nSmith utters ‘George is rich’ and yet ‘Smith said\nthat George is rich’ is false in some context. If so, then the\nabove test entails that the sentence is not context-sensitive. The\ndisquotation test, however, is controversial. For discussion of this\ntest and others, see Cappelen and Lepore 2005, Cappelen and Hawthorne\n2009, Leslie 2007. \n\nAs mentioned above, Kaplan’s theory of indexicals is highly\ninfluential and serves as a starting point for much current theorizing\nabout indexicals. This section presents some details of his theory. \n\nLet us consider again an example that can motivate Kaplan’s\ntheory. \n\nMary and John utter the same unambiguous sentence, yet they say\ndifferent things, for Mary says that she is a philosopher whereas John\nsays that he is a philosopher. Moreover, we can imagine that Mary is a\nphilosopher and John is not, so what Mary says is true whereas\nwhat John says is false. In view of these considerations,\nKaplan (1989a) proposes a distinction between two kinds of meaning,\ncharacter and content. The sentence ‘I am a\nphilosopher’ has a single character, but has different contents\nwith respect to different contexts. Kaplan usually identifies character\nwith linguistic meaning, which is a kind of meaning fixed by linguistic\nconvention. \n\nOn Kaplan’s (1989a) theory, indexicals have contents\nin, or with respect to, contexts. Each\ncontext has associated with it at least an agent, time, location, and\npossible world. The content of ‘I’ with respect to a\ncontext \\(c\\) is the agent of \\(c\\). The content of\n‘here’ is the location of \\(c\\). The content of\n‘now’ is the time of \\(c\\). The content of\n‘actually’ is (roughly) the property of being the case\n(being true) with respect to the world of \\(c\\). \n\nKaplan extends his theory of content to linguistic expressions in\ngeneral, both simple and complex. On his view, the content of a\npredicate, with respect to a context, is a property or relation. The\ncontent of a sentence, with respect to a context, is a structured\nproposition, that is, a proposition with a constituent structure\nwhose ultimate constituents are individual, properties, and relations.\n(See the entry on \n structured propositions.) \nThe content of a sentence\n\\(S\\) with respect to a context \\(c\\) has, as its ultimate\nconstituents, the contents of (roughly) the words in \\(S\\) with\nrespect to \\(c\\). \n\nTo illustrate, consider the sentence ‘I am a\nphilosopher’. Suppose that the agent of context\n\\(c_1\\) is Mary. Then the content of ‘I’ in\n\\(c_1\\) is Mary herself, while the content of ‘is\na philosopher’ in \\(c_1\\) is the property of being\na philosopher. The content of the whole sentence, in\n\\(c_1\\), is a proposition whose constituents are just\nthose two items. We can represent this proposition with the ordered\npair \\(\\langle \\text{Mary},\\) \\(\\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\). \nA structured proposition which, like the preceding one, has an\nindividual as a constituent, is a\nsingular proposition. The content of ‘I’ with\nrespect to another context \\(c_2\\), in which John is the\nagent, is John, and the content of ‘I am a philosopher’ in\n\\(c_2\\) is the singular proposition \n\\(\\langle \\text{John},\\) \\(\\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\). \n\n(Before continuing, we need a few interpretive qualifications. The\ndescription of contents in the two previous paragraphs, and in the rest\nof this subsection, follows the informal parts of Kaplan’s work\n(1989a, 1989b), in which he often identifies contents with individuals,\nproperties, relations, and structured propositions. See especially the\npreface to Demonstratives. But when Kaplan turns to more\ntechnical matters, he represents contents with intensions: see the end\nof this section below and also section 3.7. Kaplan even goes so far as\nto assert that singular propositions are not a part of his theory\n(1989a, p. 496). He might mean by this that they are not a part of his\nformal logic of demonstratives; or he may wish to emphasize that one\ncould accept the core of his theory of indexicals, including his\ndistinction between character and content, while rejecting structured\ncontents. In any case, for the rest of this section, we will continue\nto describe a version of Kaplan’s theory that uses structured\npropositions.) \n\nPropositions, on Kaplan’s theory, have truth-values with\nrespect to circumstances of evaluation, which Kaplan\nidentifies with pairs of times and possible worlds, \n\\(\\langle t, w \\rangle\\). A single proposition may be true with respect to one\ncircumstance of evaluation and false with respect another. For example,\nthe proposition \\(\\langle \\text{Mary}, \\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\) may be true at\n\\(\\langle t_1, w_1 \\rangle\\) and yet false at\n\\(\\langle t_1, w_2 \\rangle\\) because, in\n\\(w_1\\), Mary is a philosopher at time\n\\(t_1\\), whereas in world \\(w_2\\) she is not\na philosopher at time \\(t_1\\). Similarly, if time\n\\(t_0\\) is a time before Mary became a philosopher in\n\\(w_1\\), and \\(t_1\\) is a time after\nwhich she became a philosopher in \\(w_1\\), then\n\\(\\langle \\text{Mary},\\) \\(\\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\) is false at\n\\(\\langle t_0, w_1 \\rangle\\) but true at\n\\(\\langle t_1, w_1 \\rangle\\). In the remainder\nof this section, we will usually, for the sake of simplicity, pretend\nthat Kaplan’s circumstances of evaluation are just possible\nworlds, and ignore variation in truth-value over time. \n\nOn Kaplan’s theory, we can speak not only of the truth-values\nof propositions at worlds, but also of the truth-values of\nsentences at pairs of worlds and contexts. The reason\nwe can do this is that a context determines the content of a sentence,\nand the content of that sentence determines a truth-value at a world.\nFor example, the content of the sentence ‘I am a\nphilosopher’ in the context \\(c_1\\) described\nabove is the singular proposition that Mary is a philosopher. This\nproposition is true with respect to world \\(w_1\\). So,\nthe sentence ‘I am a philosopher’ is true with\nrespect to \\(c_1\\) and \\(w_1\\). By\ncontrast, the content of the sentence ‘I am a philosopher’\nat the context \\(c_2\\) (in which John is the agent) is\nthe singular proposition that John is a philosopher, and this\nproposition is false at \\(w_1\\) (let’s suppose).\nSo, the sentence ‘I am a philosopher’ is false\nwith respect to \\(c_2\\) and \\(w_1\\). So,\nthe truth-value of the sentence ‘I am a\nphilosopher’ is doubly relativized to both context and\nworld. This sort of double-relativization is often called\ndouble-indexing. (See Vlach 1973 and Kamp 1973 for early\nexamples of semantic theories that use double-indexing.) \n\nEach context \\(c\\) is associated with a world, called\n‘the world of \\(c\\)’. When a sentence is true with\nrespect to context \\(c\\) and the world of \\(c\\), we say\nsimply that the sentence is true at \\(c\\), without mentioning a\nworld. But the notion of a sentence’s being true at context \\(c\\)\nand world \\(w\\) is more fundamental than the notion of a\nsentence’s being (simply) true at \\(c\\), for the\nlatter notion is defined in terms of the previous notion. Now suppose\nthat the two contexts mentioned above, \\(c_1\\) and\n\\(c_2\\), have the same associated world\n\\(w_1\\) (in which, recall, Mary is a philosopher but\nJohn is not). Then the sentence ‘I am a philosopher’ is\ntrue at context \\(c_1\\) and false at context\n\\(c_2\\). \n\nThe content of a sentence, at a context, can also be evaluated for\ntruth at a world other than the world of the context. This is how the\ntruth-values of sentences that contain modal operators, such as\n‘possible’, are determined. For example, the content of\n‘I am a philosopher’, with respect to\n\\(c_1\\), is the singular proposition that Mary is a\nphilosopher. This proposition is true at \\(w_1\\), the\nworld of context \\(c_1\\). But this proposition is false\nat world, \\(w_2\\), in which Mary goes into mathematics\nrather than philosophy. So, the sentence is true with respect\nto \\(c_1\\) and \\(w_1\\), but false\nwith respect to \\(c_1\\) and \\(w_2\\).\nTherefore, the modal sentence ‘It is possible\nthat I am not a philosopher’ is true with respect to our\noriginal context and its associated world, \\(c_1\\) and\n\\(w_1\\). Therefore, the modal sentence ‘It is\npossible that I am not a philosopher’ is simply\ntrue with respect to \\(c_1\\). (Notice that this last\nremark did not mention a world.) \n\nWe can similarly speak of the content of a singular term\nwith respect to a context, and the extension or\nreferent of that term, with respect to a context and\na world. For example, the definite description ‘the person who\ninvented bifocals’ has the same content with respect to all\ncontexts. (Its content is some type of structured entity that has\nvarious properties and relations as constituents, such as the property\nof being a person, the relation of inventing, and so on.) This content\ndetermines different individuals at different worlds, because different\npeople invent bifocals at different worlds. So, the referent\nof ‘the person who invented bifocals’, with respect to a\ncontext and a world, varies from world to world, because the\nperson who invented bifocals varies from world to world. (We assume\nhere, with Kaplan, that definite descriptions are singular terms rather\nthan quantifier phrases.) \n\nThe situation is reversed for ‘I’. The content of\n‘I’ varies from context to context: its content is Mary in\n\\(c_1\\), John in \\(c_2\\), someone\nelse in \\(c_3\\), and so on. But given a single context\n\\(c\\), the referent of ‘I’ with respect to \\(c\\)\nand world \\(w\\) is the same for any world \\(w\\) whatsoever.\nFor example, if Mary is the content of ‘I’ with respect to\n\\(c_1\\), then Mary is the referent of ‘I’\nwith respect to \\(c_1\\) and any world whatsoever. That\nis why, for any world \\(w\\), ‘I am a philosopher’ is\ntrue at \\(c_1\\) and \\(w\\) if and only if\nMary is a philosopher in \\(w\\). \n\nWhen a singular term refers to object \\(o\\) with respect to\ncontext \\(c\\) and the world of c, we can simply say that\nit refers to \\(o\\) in \\(c\\), without separately mentioning a\nworld. So, ‘I’ refers to Mary in context\n\\(c_1\\) above. But once again, the notion of referring\nwith respect to (or in) \\(c\\) is the less fundamental notion, and\nis defined in terms of the more fundamental relation of referring with\nrespect to a context \\(c\\) and a world \\(w\\). \n\nThe content of a linguistic expression, at a context, determines a\ncorresponding intension, which is a function from possible\nworlds (circumstances of evaluation, really) to extensions. For\nexample, the content of ‘I’ with respect to the context\n\\(c_1\\) described above is Mary, and the extension of\n‘I’ with respect to \\(c_1\\) and any world\n\\(w\\) whatsoever is Mary. The corresponding intension of\n‘I’ with respect to \\(c_1\\) is the function\nwhose value at any world \\(w\\) is the extension of\n‘Mary’ with respect to \\(c_1\\) and\n\\(w\\), which is just Mary herself. The intension of\n‘I’ varies from context to context, just as the content\ndoes; for instance, in context \\(c_2\\), the intension of\n‘I’ is the function on worlds whose value at any world is\nJohn. \n\nTwo expressions may have different contents in \\(c\\) and yet\nhave the same intension in that context. For instance, the contents of\nthe sentences ‘I am a philosopher’ and ‘I am a\nphilosopher and either I smoke or I do not smoke’ with respect to\n\\(c_1\\) are distinct structured propositions, for the\ncontent of the second sentence in \\(c_1\\) has the\nproperty of smoking as a constituent, whereas the content of the first\none does not. Yet these propositions have the same truth-values at all\nworlds, and so they have the same intension in\n\\(c_1\\). Though contents and intensions are\ndistinct, we can use intensions to represent contents, when we\nare willing to ignore fine-grained differences in content. This is what\nKaplan does when he sets out his logic for indexicals (see section\n3.7). \n\nKaplan contemplates two ways of extending his theory to true\ndemonstratives. In his1989a, he uses dthat-terms to do so. A\ndthat-term is a term of the form “dthat[\\(t\\)]”, where\n\\(t\\) is a singular term, such as a definite description or proper\nname. The content of ‘dthat[\\(t\\)]’ in a context\n\\(c\\) is the object to which the term \\(t\\) refers in\n\\(c\\). For example, the content of ‘dthat[the dog I see\nnow]’, in a context \\(c\\), is Fido iff: there is exactly one\ndog in the world of \\(c\\) whom the agent of \\(c\\) sees at the\ntime of \\(c\\) in the world of \\(c\\), and that dog is Fido.\nKaplan (1989a) uses dthat-terms to represent the demonstrative\n‘that’ together with a type of demonstration. Kaplan holds\nthat a type of demonstration presents a demonstratum in a particular\nway, and a definite description (that may contain indexicals) can\ncapture the way in which the demonstration presents the demonstratum.\nThus, Kaplan (1989a) might use the dthat-term ‘dthat[the dog I\nsee to my left]’ to represent Mary’s use of the word\n‘that’ together with the type of demonstration that she\nuses to present a dog to her left. If Mary utters ‘That is larger\nthan that’ while pointing first to a dog to her left and then to\na dog to her right, then Kaplan might use the formal sentence (12) to\nrepresent Mary’s sentence-plus-demonstrations. \n\nIf \\(c\\) is a context in which the agent of \\(c\\) sees\nFido to her left and Rover to her right, then the content in \\(c\\)\nof the first dthat-term is Fido and the content of the second\ndthat-term in \\(c\\) is Rover. Kaplan anticipates treating other\ntrue demonstratives, such as ‘you’, in similar ways. (For\ncritical discussion, see Salmon 2002.) \n\nKaplan presents a different treatment of true demonstratives in his\n1989b. Kaplan adds to each context an addressee and a demonstratum, and\nstipulates that the content of ‘you’ in any context\n\\(c\\) is the addressee of \\(c\\) and the content of\n‘that’ in any context \\(c\\) is the demonstratum of\n\\(c\\). Contexts may have sequences of multiple addressees and\nsequences of multiple demonstrata. Corresponding subscripts can be\nadded to ‘you’ and ‘that’. If so, the content\nof ‘you1’ with respect to \\(c\\) is the\nfirst addressee of \\(c\\), the content of\n‘you2’ in \\(c\\) is the second addressee of\n\\(c\\), and so on; similarly, the content of\n‘that1’ is the first demonstratum of \\(c\\),\nthe content of ‘that2’ is the second\ndemonstratum, and so on. (See section 5.3 for more on multiple\noccurrences of demonstratives.) \n\nKaplan (1989a, p. 505) says that he represents the character of an\nexpression with a function on contexts whose value at any context is\nthe expression’s content at that context. For example, the\ncontent of ‘I’ at any context \\(c\\) is the agent\ncharacter of \\(c\\). So the character of ‘I’ is a\nfunction on contexts whose value at any context \\(c\\) is the agent\nof \\(c\\). The value of the character of ‘I’ at a\ncontext in which Mary is the agent is just Mary herself, and its value\nat a context in which John is the agent is just John himself. The\ncharacter of a sentence is a function whose value at any context is the\nstructured propositional content of that sentence at that context. For\ninstance, the character of ‘I am a philosopher’ is a\nfunction whose value at any context \\(c\\) in which \\(A\\) is\nthe agent of \\(c\\) is the proposition \n\\(\\langle A, \\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\). \nIf Mary is the agent of \\(c\\), then the value of this function\nat \\(c\\) is \n\\(\\langle \\text{Mary}, \\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\). \n\nKaplan (1989a) claims that indexicals are devices of direct\nreference. By this he means that the content of an\nindexical, with respect to a context \\(c\\), is the object to which\nit refers in \\(c\\); its content is not a property or descriptive\ncondition that determines the referent. For example, the content of\n‘I’ in \\(c\\) is the agent of \\(c\\); its content\nin \\(c\\) is not the property or descriptive condition of being the\nagent of \\(c\\), or being the speaker of \\(c\\), or being the\nperson uttering ‘I’, or any other sort of property or\ndescriptive condition. \n\nKaplan (1989a) also says that indexicals are rigid\ndesignators. The notion of a rigid designator comes from Kripke\n(1980), who (roughly speaking) defines a rigid designator to be an\nexpression that designates the same thing with respect to all possible\nworlds. When Kaplan claims that indexicals are rigid designators, he\nmeans that if object \\(o\\) is the referent of expression\n\\(E\\) with respect to context \\(c\\) and the world of\n\\(c\\), then \\(o\\) is also the referent of \\(E\\) with\nrespect to \\(c\\) and any other world. For example, if Mary is the\nreferent of ‘I’ with respect to \\(c\\) and the world of\n\\(c\\), then Mary is also the referent of ‘I’ with\nrespect to \\(c\\) and any other world. \n\nLinguistic expressions should be distinguished from utterances.\nLinguistic expressions are abstract objects. Utterances are events in\nwhich an agent utters a linguistic expression. The word\n‘the’ is a single linguistic expression, but two utterances\nof it occur in every utterance of the sentence ‘The philosopher\nsaw the linguist’. \n\nKaplan’s theory does not ascribe characters or contents to\nutterances. Rather, it ascribes characters to linguistic expressions,\nand contents to expressions with respect to contexts. In fact,\nKaplan’s theory ascribes contents to expressions with respect to\ncontexts in which no one utters those expressions. For example, on\nKaplan’s theory, the sentence ‘I exist’ has a content\nwith respect to every context, and is true in every context, including\ncontexts in which the agent does not utter that sentence, and including\ncontexts in which no one in the world of the context speaks English.\nThe sentence ‘I utter nothing’ is true in some contexts, on\nKaplan’s theory, for there are contexts \\(c\\) in which the\nagent \\(A\\) of \\(c\\) utters nothing in the world of\n\\(c\\), and the content of the sentence in \\(c\\) is the\nproposition that \\(A\\) utters nothing, which is true in the world\nof \\(c\\). This is why Kaplan speaks of the agent of a\ncontext rather than the speaker of a context. \n\nNevertheless, Kaplan’s theory still has implications for\nutterances and speech acts. Suppose that Mary utters the sentence\n‘I am a philosopher’ in world \\(w\\). Mary’s\nutterance has an agent in \\(w\\), namely Mary, and it occurs at a\ncertain location and time in \\(w\\). So, her utterance in\n\\(w\\) determines a Kaplanian context. Call this context\n‘Mary’s context’. On Kaplan’s theory, the\nsentence Mary utters has a content in Mary’s context, namely the\nsingular proposition that Mary is a philosopher. If Mary utters the\nsentence assertively, then she (probably) asserts the content of that\nsentence in her context. So, Kaplan’s theory, together with other\nplausible assumptions, has important implications for what Mary asserts\nin her utterance. \n\nFor further discussion of utterances and expressions, see\nReichenbach 1947, Garcia-Carpintero 1998, Kaplan 1999, Perry 2000, and\nsection 5.3 below. \n\nKaplan (1989a) presents an elaborate logic of indexicals. We shall\nconcentrate here on aspects of this logic that can be understood\nwithout going deeply into formal details. \n\nThe language of Kaplan’s logic is that of modal first-order\npredicate logic with tense operators and other additions. The additions\ninclude a distinguished predicate ‘Exists’, a distinguished\nbinary predicate ‘Located’, a distinguished constant\n‘I’, a distinguished constant ‘Here’, and a\nfunction-term ‘dthat’. \n\nIn standard first-order predicate logic, validity is defined as\ntruth in all structures (sometimes called ‘models’) of a\ncertain sort. In modal logic, validity is typically defined as truth at\nevery world in every structure of a certain (different) sort. Kaplan\nsimilarly defines validity as truth at every context in every\nLD structure. (‘LD’ stands for ‘the Logic of\nDemonstratives’.) Each LD structure contains a set of\ncontexts, a set of worlds, a set of individuals, a set of positions\n(common to all worlds), a set of times (common to all worlds), and a\nfunction that assigns to each predicate and individual constant an\nintension, which is a function from time-world pairs to extensions.\n(Thus Kaplan’s LD structures do not assign structured contents to\nexpressions in contexts. LD structures use intensions to\nrepresent contents.) Each context has an associated agent,\ntime, position, and world. Various stipulations about structures and\ncontexts together ensure that, for every context \\(c\\) in every\nstructure M: (i) the agent of \\(c\\) is a member of the extension of\n‘Exist’ at the time and world of \\(c\\), and (ii) the\nordered pair \n\\(\\langle \\text{the agent of } c, \\text{the position of } c \\rangle\\) \nis a member of the extension of ‘Located’ at\nthe time and world of \\(c\\). \n\nKaplan uses standard methods to define truth for a formula,\nand denotation for a term, with respect to any given\nstructure, context, time, world and assignment of values to variables.\n(Assignments will not be mentioned from here on.) Kaplan defines the\nnotions of Content and Character for formulas and terms in terms of\ntruth and denotation. The Content of a formula, with respect to a\nstructure and context, is a function whose value at any time-world pair\nis the truth-value of the formula with respect to the preceding\nstructure, context, time, and world. In short, the Content of an\nexpression, with respect to a structure and context, is an intension.\nThe Content of a singular term, with respect to a structure and\ncontext, is also an appropriate intension. Finally, the Character of a\nformula or term is the function from structures and contexts to\nContents whose value, for any structure and context, is the Content of\nthat expression with respect to that structure and context. \n\nA formula is true at a context \\(c\\) in a structure \\(M\\)\niff: the formula is true with respect to \\(c\\) and the time and\nworld of \\(c\\) in \\(M\\). A formula is valid iff: for\nevery structure \\(M\\), and every context \\(c\\) of \\(M\\),\nthe formula is true at \\(c\\) in \\(M\\). Kaplan says that the\nnotion of logical consequence can be defined in any of the usual\nways. \n\nSentences that are valid in standard (modal) first-order predicate\nlogic are also valid in Kaplan’s logic of indexicals. But there\nare also valid sentences peculiar to Kaplan’s logic of\nindexicals. For instance, the formal analogs of ‘I exist’\nand ‘I am here now’ are true in every context in every\nstructure, and so are valid. This result is due to Kaplan’s\nstipulations that the agent of a context \\(c\\) exists at the time\nand world of \\(c\\), and that the agent of \\(c\\) is located at\nthe position of \\(c\\) at the time and world of \\(c\\). In\naddition, every (formal) sentence of the form “\\(S\\) if and\nonly if actually \\(S\\)” is valid. This is so because\n\\(S\\) is true at a context (in a structure) if and only if\n“Actually \\(S\\)” is. \n\nA striking feature of Kaplan’s logic is that some valid\nsentences are contingently true, at some contexts in some LD\nstructures. One example is ‘I exist’. We saw above that it\nis valid. Now consider an LD structure \\(M\\) in which Mary exists\nat some of the worlds in \\(M\\) but fails to exist at others. (More\nexactly, Mary is in the extension of ‘Exist’ at some pairs\n\\(\\langle t, w \\rangle\\) but is not in the extension of\n‘Exist’ at some other pairs \n\\(\\langle t, w' \\rangle\\).) Next, consider a context \\(c\\) in which\nMary is the agent. The formal analog of the sentence ‘I\nexist’ is true with respect to \\(c\\) and the time and world\nof \\(c\\) in \\(M\\), and so is true at \\(c\\) in\n\\(M\\). But that sentence is false with respect to \\(c\\),\n\\(t\\), and other worlds in \\(M\\). Therefore,\n‘Necessarily, I exist’ (or its formal analog) is false at\n\\(c\\) in \\(M\\). Thus, ‘I exist’ is only\ncontingently true at some contexts in some LD structures. Parallel\npoints holds for ‘I am here now’: it is valid, but only\ncontingently true at some contexts in some structures. Similarly, every\nsentence of the form “\\(S\\) if and only if actually\n\\(S\\)” is valid, but some sentences of this form are only\ncontingently true at some contexts in some structures. \n\nKaplan holds that since ‘I exist’ is valid, one could\nknow a priori the proposition that it expresses, in a context.\nFor example, if Mary considers and understands the sentence ‘I\nexist’, then she can know a priori the proposition that\nit expresses in her context. Thus Kaplan concludes that she can know\na priori the proposition that she exists. But this proposition\nis contingent, so Mary can have a priori knowledge of a\ncontingent proposition. Thus Kaplan claims that his logic of indexicals\nprovides examples of Kripke’s (1980) contingent a priori\ntruths. (For discussion, see Salmon 1991, Forbes 1989) \n\nUsing a standard definition of validity for arguments,\nKaplan’s formal analogs of arguments (13)–(15) are valid. \n\nThus, Kaplan’s logic of indexicals may aid in understanding\nthe logic of some philosophically interesting arguments. \n\nKaplan’s theory of indexicals is influential, and so has been\nsubject to much critical scrutiny. A few criticisms will be described\nimmediately below. Others criticisms will emerge later in this\narticle. \n\nKaplan sometimes argues for his theory by appealing to intuitions\nabout what is said. For instance, Kaplan claims that if John\nutters ‘I am hungry’ and Mary utters ‘I am\nhungry’ then what they say is different, whereas if John\nutters ‘I am hungry’ and Mary utters ‘You are\nhungry’ while addressing John, then what they say is the\nsame. David Lewis (1980) says that Kaplan’s appeals to judgments\nabout what is said are unpersuasive. Lewis also maintains that Kaplan\nfails to justify his claim that Kaplanian contents have a distinctive\nrole to play in semantics. Lewis (1980) claims that the primary task of\nsemantics is to describe how semantic values of sentences\ndetermine truth-values at contexts and circumstances of evaluation, the\nlatter of which Lewis calls ‘indices’. Lewis holds that\nthis can be done in (at least) two equally good ways. First, we can\n(like Kaplan) allow the semantic value of a sentence to vary from\ncontext to context, and design these varying semantic values so that\nthey determine truth-values with respect to indices. Second, we can\ninstead once-and-for-all assign to a sentence a single semantic value\nthat determines a truth-value given both a context and an index. On\nviews of this latter sort, semantic values are functions from pairs of\ncontexts and indices to truth-values. Lewis claims that there is no\ntheoretical reason to prefer one sort of theory over the other. \n\nKaplan’s semantics entails that that propositions can vary in\ntruth-value from one time to another. He also assumes that propositions\nare the things that agents assert and believe. But he admits (1989a,\n503, n. 28) that the objects of assertion and belief are traditionally\nthought to be eternal, that is, not to vary in truth-value\nfrom time to time. Salmon (1989) argues that Kaplan’s theory\nneeds to be amended so as to make contents eternal. Salmon argues that\nonce this amendment is made, it becomes evident that to deal adequately\nwith tense, a semantic theory needs both (a) content-like\nmeanings that vary in extension from time to time in the way that\nKaplan’s contents do and (b) content-like meanings that are\neternal. Jeffrey King (2003) also criticizes Kaplan for allowing\ncontents (propositions) to be non-eternal. See Cappelen and Hawthorne\n(2009) for related discussion. \n\nBach (2005) says that the only indexicals that have contents with\nrespect to contexts are the pure indexicals, such as ‘I’\nand ‘today’. True demonstratives, such as\n‘she’ and ‘that’, have no content in any\ncontext, and so the contents (in contexts) of sentences that contain\nthem are propositional radicals (incomplete structured\npropositions). However, a speaker who utters such a sentence typically\nasserts a full proposition that completes the propositional radical\nthat the sentence semantically expresses. (In this paragraph, and in\nmost of the rest of section 4, we use ‘belief’ for events\nor states of believing propositions, rather than for propositions that\nare believed. We also use ‘desire’,\n‘intention’, and ‘attitude’ similarly.)  \n\nBraun (1995) argues that the functions that Kaplan uses to represent\ncharacters in his formal logic (functions from structures and\ncontexts to contents) misrepresent the more interesting notion of\ncharacter described in the less formal parts of Kaplan’s theory\n(where Kaplan seemingly uses functions from contexts to contents in the intended structure to\nrepresent characters). Richard (2003) and Braun (1994) argue that\nstructured characters, in addition to structured contents, are\nneeded to distinguish between the linguistic meanings of certain pairs\nof expressions. \n\nKaplan maintains that ‘I am here now’ is logically\nvalid, and yet he admits that the sentence ‘I am not\nhere now’ is commonly used for answering-machine messages (1989a,\n491, n. 12). For discussion of this “answering-machine\npuzzle,” see Predelli 1998a, 1998b; Corazza et al. 2002;\nRomdenh-Romluc 2002; and Cohen 2013. \n\nFor further criticisms of Kaplan’s theory (other than those\nthat will emerge below), and for presentations of alternative theories,\nsee Burge 1974, Weinstein 1974, Roberts 2002, and Elbourne 2008. \n\nIndexical beliefs are, roughly speaking, beliefs that agents are\ndisposed to express by uttering sentences that contain indexicals. If\nMary utters ‘I am a philosopher’, ‘You are a\nphilosopher’, ‘She is a philosopher’ (while\ndemonstrating someone), ‘The weather is good today’, or\n‘John is here’, then she expresses an indexical belief.\nIndexical desires and indexical intentions are,\nroughly speaking, desires and intentions that agents can express by\nuttering sentences containing indexicals, such as ‘I want you to\nwin the game’ and ‘I shall follow you’. Thus, we can\nspeak more generally of indexical attitudes. (In this\nparagraph, and for most of the rest of section 4, we use\n‘belief’ as a term for events or states of believing\npropositions, rather than for propositions that are believed. We use\n‘desire’, ‘intention’, and\n‘attitude’ similarly.) \n\nIndexical beliefs are sometimes called self-locating\nbeliefs (Perry 1977), because the beliefs that one has when one knows\nwho one is, where one is, and when one is, are often expressed by\nuttering sentences containing ‘I’, ‘here’,\n‘now’, and other indexicals. Indexical beliefs that can be\nexpressed with ‘I’ are sometimes (following Lewis 1979)\ncalled ‘de se beliefs’. (‘De\nse’ is Latin for ‘of oneself’.) Those expressed\nwith ‘now’ are sometimes called ‘de nunc\nbeliefs’. (‘De nunc’ is Latin for ‘of\nnow’.) Some philosophers hold that indexical beliefs are de\nre beliefs, which are beliefs of objects.\n(‘De re’ is Latin for of objects.) For\nexample, some would say that the belief that Mary expresses by uttering\n‘You are a philosopher’ to Bill is a de re belief\nconcerning Bill. \n\nSome philosophers hold that indexical attitudes, and so indexicals\nthemselves, are important to understanding philosophically significant\nphenomena such as the following: Agency and explanation of action\n(Castañeda 1975; Perry 1979, 2000; McGinn 1983; and the\nentry on \n action);\nself-consciousness, subjectivity, and the first-person perspective\n(Nagel 1986, McDowell 1998); consciousness and qualia (Perry 1999; \nand the entries on \n  consciousness and \n  qualia);\nperceptual content (Egan 2006;  and the entry on \n  the contents of perception);\n immunity to error\nthrough misidentification (Shoemaker 1968); secondary qualities (McGinn\n1983; Egan 2006); and various issues in moral philosophy (Velleman\n1999; Hare 2007). For skepticism about the importance of indexicals to\none or more of these topics, see Millikan 1990, Cappelen and Dever\n2013, and Magidor forthcoming. \n\nWe shall concentrate here on the seeming implications that the\ntheory of indexical semantics has for the theory of indexical belief,\nand vice versa. To grasp these seeming mutual implications, consider\nsentence (16) below. \n\nSuppose that John understands sentence (16) and assertively utters\n(16) while addressing Mary and intending to refer to her. Then,\nplausibly, John asserts the proposition that (16) semantically\nexpresses in his context. Moreover, if John is sincere, then he\nbelieves the proposition that (16) expresses in his context.\nThus a semantic theory that describes the content of sentence (16) in\nJohn’s context also describes a proposition that he believes.\nHence the theory of indexical semantics has implications for the theory\nof indexical belief. Theories of indexical belief can also have\nimportant implications for the semantics of indexicals. If, for\ninstance, speakers do not believe the propositions that a semantic\ntheory assigns to indexical sentences, relative to contexts, then that\nis prima facie reason to reject that semantic theory. \n\nThe remainder of this section will be dedicated to considering\nindexical belief and its implications for indexical semantics. (We\nshall, however, try to avoid discussing the semantics of belief\nascriptions. See instead the entry on \n  propositional attitude reports.) \n\nDirect reference theories of indexicals (such as\nKaplan’s) say that the contents of ‘I’,\n‘he’, ‘she’, ‘you’,\n‘that’, and similar indexicals, in contexts, are the\nindividuals to which those terms refer, in those contexts. Further, the\ncontents (in contexts) of sentences containing such indexicals\nsentences are singular propositions (structured propositions\nthat have individuals as constituents). Thus direct reference theories,\ntogether with the earlier assumptions about the connection of semantics\nwith belief, imply that agents with indexical beliefs believe singular\npropositions. But various examples suggest that there is something\nwrong with, or at least something missing from, theories that say that\nagents with indexical beliefs believe singular propositions. Here is\none famous example of this sort. \n\nThe messy shopper (Perry 1979) \n\nJohn is in a grocery store, pushing a shopping cart. At the end of\neach row in the store there is a large mirror mounted near the ceiling.\nJohn notices a reflection of a shopper in one of these mirrors. He\ncannot see the shopper’s face, but he can see that the\nshopper’s cart contains a leaking bag of sugar. John utters\n‘He is making a mess’ and sets off to find the messy\nshopper. But in fact, John saw a reflection of himself, and the leaking\nbag of sugar that he saw was in his own cart. After circling the store,\nJohn returns to the spot where he first spotted the messy shopper. He\nencounters the trail of sugar that he left behind. He then says\n‘I am making a mess’, stops his cart, and adjusts the\nleaking bag of sugar in his cart. \n\nLet \\(t_0\\) be the time at which John first saw the\nmessy shopper and uttered ‘He is making a mess’. Let\n\\(t_1\\) be the later time at which John uttered ‘I\nam making a mess’ and stopped pushing his cart. It seems that\nJohn began to believe something at time \\(t_1\\) that he\ndid not believe at \\(t_0\\). One proposition he seemingly\nbegan to believe for the first time at \\(t_1\\) is the\nproposition that the sentence ‘I am making a mess’\nexpressed in his context at \\(t_1\\). However, according\nto direct reference theories, that sentence expressed, in John’s\ncontext at \\(t_1\\), the singular proposition that John\nis making a mess. But John already believed the proposition that\n‘He is making a mess’ expressed in his context at the\nearlier time \\(t_0\\), and he continued to believe\nthat proposition through time \\(t_1\\). If direct\nreference theories are true, that proposition is also the singular\nproposition that John is making a mess. So, direct reference theories\nentail that John already believed, before time \\(t_1\\),\nthe singular proposition that John is making a mess. So, if direct\nreference theories are correct, then it is not the case that John began\nto believe a proposition at \\(t_1\\) that he did not\npreviously believe. But he did. Therefore, direct reference theories of\nindexicals are incorrect. \n\nWe can extract a simpler argument against direct reference theories\nfrom the messy shopper example by adding one more element to it.\nConsider the earlier time \\(t_0\\) when John first looked\nin the mirror and uttered ‘He is making a mess’, and now\nsuppose he also uttered ‘I am not making a mess’ at that\ntime. Then he believed the propositions expressed by both ‘He is\nmaking a mess’ and ‘I am not making a mess’ in his\ncontext at \\(t_0\\). But according to direct reference\ntheories, ‘He is making a mess’ expresses, in John’s\ncontext at \\(t_0\\), the singular proposition that John\nis making a mess and the sentence ‘I am not making a mess’\nexpresses, in that same context, the singular proposition that John is\nnot making a mess. So, if direct reference theories are true, then at\n\\(t_0\\), John believed both a proposition and its\nnegation. But John is rational, and no rational person believes a\nproposition and its negation. Therefore, direct reference theories of\nindexicals are incorrect. \n\nBoth of the above objections to direct reference theories of\nindexicals can easily be modified to target theories that say that the\ncontents of expressions containing indexicals, in contexts, are merely\nintensions, rather than structured contents. \n\nBefore considering replies from direct-reference theorists, let us\nconsider an alternative semantics for indexicals, and an alternative\ntheory of indexical belief, that may avoid the apparent problems with\ndirect-reference theories. \n\nThe above objections resemble Frege’s puzzles of cognitive\nsignificance for proper names. (See the entries on \n Gottlob Frege and\n propositional attitude reports.) \nOne traditional response to problems of cognitive significance for\nproper names is to adopt a descriptivist theory of proper\nnames.  There are parallel descriptivist theories of indexicals. \n\nOn some traditional descriptivist theories of proper names, the\ncontent of a proper name can be expressed by a purely\nqualitative definite description, which is a definite description\nthat does not contain any directly-referential terms (such as proper\nnames and indexicals, if these are directly-referential). For example,\non some views of this type, the content of the name ‘Benjamin\nFranklin’, in some speakers’ idiolects, is the same as that\nof the definite description ‘the person who invented\nbifocals’. \n\nSimilarly, according to some descriptivist theories of indexicals,\nevery indexical, in every context, has a purely qualitative descriptive\ncontent. This content determines the indexical’s referent with\nrespect to the world of the context (and any other world). A single\nindexical can have different descriptive contents in different\ncontexts, and so can have different referents in different contexts.\nThe descriptive content expressed by an indexical in a context is\ndetermined by the thoughts and intentions of the agent/speaker of the\ncontext. For example, when John utters ‘he’, he may mean\nthe man who is \\(F\\), where the property of being a man and\n\\(F\\) is a purely qualitative property that suffices to determine\na particular man independently of any context. The object determined by\nthis descriptive content is the object to which ‘he’\nrefers, with respect to John’s context. If John utters ‘He\nis making a mess’, then the proposition that John believes and\nasserts is the proposition that the man who is \\(F\\) is making a\nmess. \n\nAn advocate of this purely qualitative descriptivist theory of\nindexicals could analyze the example of the messy shopper, in outline,\nas follows. When John first spots the messy shopper at\n\\(t_0\\), and utters ‘He is making a mess’,\nhe begins to believe the descriptive proposition that the man who is\n\\(F\\) is making a mess, where \\(F\\) is a purely qualitative\nproperty. Later, at \\(t_1\\), when John utters ‘I\nam making a mess’, he begins to believe that the man who is\n\\(G\\) is making a mess, where \\(G\\) is a purely qualitative\nproperty different from \\(F\\). Therefore, John begins to believe a\nproposition that he did not previously believe, contrary to what\ndirect-reference theories entail. Consider also the slightly modified\ncase in which John utters both ‘He is making a mess’ and\n‘I am not making a mess’ when he first looks in\nthe mirror at \\(t_0\\). On a descriptivist analysis, John\nat that moment believes both the proposition that the man who is\n\\(F\\) is making a mess and the proposition that the man who is\n\\(G\\) is not making a mess. The second proposition is not\nthe negation of the first, so John is perfectly rational to believe\nboth. Thus the purely qualitative descriptivist theory seems to avoid\nthe above problems for direct reference theories. \n\nBut Hector-Neri Castañeda (1966, 1967), John Perry (1977,\n1979), and Kaplan (1989a) have presented a number of compelling\nobjections to purely qualitative descriptivist theories. Versions of\nsome of these objections appear below. \n\nOn the above descriptivist theory, John contemplates a purely\nqualitative descriptive content when he utters ‘He is making a\nmess’. Yet if John were asked to whom he was referring with\n‘he’, it is unlikely that he would respond with a purely\nqualitative definite description. Rather, he would probably respond\nwith a description like ‘the man I see in that mirror’,\nwhich is not purely qualitative unless John is contemplating purely\nqualitative properties when he utters ‘I’ and ‘that\nmirror’. Perhaps if John thought very hard, he could formulate a\npurely qualitative description that he thinks refers to the man he\nsees, such as the description ‘the man wearing a green shirt, red\ntrousers, and white shoes who is pushing a shopping cart’. But if\nhe has to think hard to find such a description, then he probably did\nnot entertain the content of that description when he first uttered\n‘He is making a mess’. \n\nWaiving that objection, suppose that John does answer with a purely\nqualitative description, such as ‘the man wearing a green shirt,\nred trousers, and white shoes who is pushing a shopping cart’.\nStill, the description he uses may fail to refer to the person to whom\nJohn referred when he uttered ‘he’. Imagine that the mirror\nhas distorted the color of the trousers that John sees: the trousers he\nsees (namely, his own trousers) appear red to him in the mirror, but\nthey are in fact purple. So the preceding description does not pick out\nJohn. Now suppose further that there is a man who does fit the\ndescription perfectly, but he is in a grocery store far from John, and\nis not making a mess. Then the purely qualitative descriptivist theory\nentails that ‘He is making a mess’ is false in John’s\ncontext. But the sentence John utters is true in his context, contrary\nto the theory. \n\nKaplan (1989a) gives modal arguments against purely qualitative\ndescriptivist theories of indexicals. Here is a modified version of one\nof his objections. Suppose, again, that the descriptive content of\n‘he’ in John’s context is the content of ‘the\nman wearing a green shirt, red trousers, and white shoes who is pushing\na shopping cart’. Then the following sentence expresses a\nnecessary truth in John’s context: ‘He is wearing a green\nshirt, if he exists’. But that sentence expresses a contingent\ntruth, not a necessary truth, in John’s context. \n\nWe will soon consider other theories of indexical belief, and\nalternative semantic theories for indexicals, that are motivated by the\nabove examples of indexical belief. But before doing so, let us\nconsider how direct-reference theorists have responded to the earlier\nobjections to their views. \n\nPerry (1977, 1979) and Kaplan (1989a), claim that belief is a\nbinary relation that agents can bear to propositions. But they\nsay that this relation is mediated by a third entity. (Compare\nwith assertion: assertion is a binary relation between agents and\npropositions, but it is mediated by sentences, or their characters.)\nThus Perry and Kaplan claim that agents can believe a singular\nproposition in different ways. (Compare again with assertion:\nJohn can assert the singular proposition that he is shopping in at\nleast two ways, by uttering either ‘John is shopping’ or\n‘I am shopping’.) Moreover, a rational agent can rationally\nbelieve both a proposition and its negation, as long as he does so in\nsuitably different ways. \n\nPerry (1977) and Kaplan (1989a) take the relevant mediators of belief to be\ncharacters (Perry calls them ‘roles’). An agent can believe\na proposition under one character, but fail to believe it\nunder another character. This is John’s state when he first sees\nthe messy shopper at \\(t_0\\), and he is willing to utter\n‘He is making a mess’ but is not willing to utter ‘I\nam making a mess’. Perry and Kaplan also hold that a rational\nagent can believe a proposition under one character and also believe\nthe negation of that proposition under a suitably different character.\nThis is what happens when John utters ‘He is making a mess’\nand ‘I am not making a mess’ in the slightly modified\nexample: John believes the singular proposition that John is making\nmess under the character of ‘He is making a mess’ but\nbelieves the negation of that proposition under the character of\n‘I am not making mess’. He is rational because the second\ncharacter is not the negation of the first character (roughly speaking). \n\nThe claim that agents believe propositions under characters\nis reasonably clear when agents utter sentences to express their\nindexical beliefs. But agents believe many propositions that they do\nnot express with sentences. Perhaps for this reason, Perry (1979)\nmodifies the ways-of-believing theory by distinguishing between (i) the\nproposition that an agent believes and (ii) the belief state\nin virtue of which the agent believes that proposition. Perry holds\nthat for any one proposition, there are many belief states that would\nenable an agent to believe that proposition. An agent can be in one of\nthese belief states while failing to be in another. Belief states can\nbe classified into types by the characters of the sentences that they\ndispose agents to utter. For instance, a belief state that would cause\nJohn to utter ‘He is making a mess’ can be classified with\nthe character of that sentence, whereas a belief state that disposes\nJohn to utter ‘I am making mess’ can be classified with the\ncharacter of that sentence. John can rationally be in a belief state of\nthe first sort while failing to be in a belief state of the second\nsort. He can, in addition, be in a belief state of the first sort while\nalso being in a belief state that disposes him to utter the negation of\nthe second. For further discussion and criticisms, see Wettstein\n(1986), Taschek (1987), and Crimmins (1992, chapter 1). \n\nPerry’s subsequent theories replace belief states with more\nelaborate systems of mental representation, and replace classification\nof belief states by characters with classifications of mental\nrepresentations by cognitive roles and various types of semantic\nvalues. For details, see the papers that appear in Perry (1997,\n2001). \n\nDavid Lewis (1979a) and Roderick Chisholm (1981) independently\ndeveloped theories of indexical belief according to which the things\nthat agents believe are properties rather than propositions.\nThe primary differences between Lewis’s view and Chisholm’s\nview are ontological. Chisholm’s primitive ontology includes\nproperties and relations. Lewis’s does not. It instead includes sets of\npossible objects, such as possible worlds and other individuals. Lewis reduces properties to\nsets of possible objects and relations to sets of \\(n\\)-tuples of possible\nobjects. Lewis’s variant has been more influential, and so we\nconcentrate on his theory below. \n\nOn Lewis’s view, believing is self-ascribing. Agents\nself-ascribe properties, so the things they believe are properties. If\nJohn sincerely utters ‘I am making a mess’, then he\nself-ascribes the property of making a mess, and therefore he believes\nthat property. An agent who seemingly believes a purely general\nqualitative proposition \\(P\\) in fact believes the corresponding\nproperty of being such that \\(P\\). For example, if John sincerely\nutters ‘Some dogs are brown’, he believes (self-ascribes)\nthe property of being such that some dogs are brown. \n\nSome presentations of Lewis’s view replace properties with\nsets of centered worlds (Egan 2006, Ninan 2013). Centered\nworlds are ordered pairs \\(\\langle o, w \\rangle\\) where\n\\(o\\) is an object and \\(w\\) is a world. Suppose, as Lewis\ndoes, that properties are sets of possible objects; alternatively,\nsuppose that a property \\(F\\) is an intension, namely a function\nwhose value at any world \\(w\\) is the set of objects that have\n\\(F\\) at \\(w\\). Then, as Lewis (1979a) points out, believing\na property \\(F\\) is, in a certain sense, equivalent to believing\nthe set of centered worlds \\(\\langle o, w \\rangle\\) such that\n\\(o\\) has \\(F\\) in \\(w\\). \n\nAgents cannot directly ascribe properties to individuals other than\nthemselves, for all ascription of properties is self-ascription. But\nunder the right conditions, agents can indirectly ascribe\nproperties to objects other than themselves by self-ascribing\nproperties that (roughly speaking) uniquely describe those other\nobjects. For example, suppose that Mary sees Bill and only Bill. She\nmay then self-ascribe the property of seeing exactly one man such that\nhe is hungry. (More precisely, she may self-ascribe the property of\nbeing an \\(x\\) such that there is exactly one \\(y\\) such that\n\\(y\\) is a man and \\(x\\) sees \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) is\nhungry.) If she does so, then she indirectly ascribes the property of\nbeing hungry to Bill, under the relation of being a man uniquely seen.\nLewis counts the relation of being a man uniquely seen as an\nacquaintance relation. According to Lewis, believing a\nproperty that uniquely determines an object under an acquaintance\nrelation is sufficient for having a de re belief about that\nobject. So, Lewis would say that Mary de re believes of Bill\nthat he is hungry. But Lewis (1979a) also says “Beliefs de\nre are not really beliefs,” for he thinks that de\nre belief is too extrinsic a matter to count as genuine\nbelief. \n\nLewis would analyze the messy shopper case as follows. When John\nlooks into the mirror and utters ‘He is making a mess’, he\nbegins to believe (to self-ascribe) the property of uniquely seeing a\nman in a mirror that is making a mess. However, John does not,\nat that point, believe (self-ascribe) the property of making a mess.\nJohn starts to believe that property only after he has searched for the\nmessy shopper. So, when John utters ‘I am making a mess’,\nhe begins to believe something (the property of making a mess) that he\ndid not previously believe. \n\nLewis and Chisholm do not extend their views of indexical belief to\nthe semantics of indexicals. That is, neither of them claims that the\ncontent of a sentence containing an indexical, in a context, is a\nproperty. Lewis (1980) mentions various semantic values that a semantic\ntheory might assign to a sentence containing an indexical, but none of\nthese semantic values are properties of the sort mentioned by his\ntheory of indexical belief. \n\nTurning now to criticisms, Lewis’s and Chisholm’s views\nsay that agents believe properties. Properties are neither true nor\nfalse. But agents, one might object, often believe things that are true\nand false. Neither Lewis nor Chisholm addresses this objection\ndirectly. But Lewis sometimes says that an agent can be right to\nbelieve a property, or that an agent can believe a property truly, and\nhe says this when the relevant agent believes a property that the agent\nhas. This suggests that Lewis would analyze the notion of believing\nsomething that is true with some notion like that of believing\nsomething truly. \n\nBoth Lewis and Chisholm hold that whenever an agent has a belief\nabout an object other than herself, she grasps a property that\ndescriptively determines that object. The relevant property need not be\npurely qualitative, for it may relate the object to herself.\nNevertheless, this is a strong form of descriptivism. David Austin\n(1990) presents detailed, putative counterexamples to their views that\nfocus on this descriptivist aspect of their theories. \n\nStalnaker (1981, 2008) argues that Lewis’s view entails an\nimplausible incommunicability of belief. Suppose that Mary believes\nthat she is hungry and utters ‘I am hungry’. On\nLewis’s view, she believes the property of being hungry. Suppose\nBill hears her and agrees with her. He cannot agree with her by\nbelieving what she believes, for if he did, he would believe the\nproperty of being hungry, and so ascribe that property to himself, not\nto Mary. The best that Bill can do is self-ascribe a property that\nrelates himself uniquely to her, such as the property of speaking\nuniquely to a person who is hungry. \n\nFor further discussion of Lewis’s view, and modifications of\nit, see Stalnaker 1981, 2008; Ninan 2013; Cappelen and Dever 2013; and\nMagidor forthcoming. \n\nMany philosophers have presented alternative theories of indexical\nbelief, sometimes along with alternative theories of indexical\nsemantics. \n\nGottlob Frege (1997b) holds that each agent can think of himself or\nherself via a sense that no other agent can grasp. Other aspects of\nFrege’s views on indexicals are the subjects of interpretive\ncontroversy. For discussion, see Perry (1977, 1979), Evans (1985),\nKripke (2011), and Burge (2012). \n\nSchiffer (1978, 1981) holds that each agent can believe a singular\nproposition about herself, but cannot believe a singular proposition about\nany other object. All belief that is seemingly about other objects\nreduces to descriptive belief. Nevertheless, he holds that the correct\nsemantics for indexicals is a direct-reference theory. Schiffer’s\nview of indexical belief is quite similar to Lewis’s and\nChisholm’s, as Austin (1990) points out. Austin offers criticisms\nof Schiffer’s view that parallel his criticisms of Lewis’s\nand Chisholm’s views. \n\nEvans (1985) holds (roughly) that agents with indexical beliefs\nbelieve singular propositions that have the characters of indexicals as\nconstituents. For example, a person who utters ‘He is making a\nmess’, while pointing at John, believes a proposition that has as\nconstituents John, the relation of demonstrating, and the property of\nmaking a mess. For discussion, see Perry 2000. \n\nFor other views on indexical belief, see Castañeda 1966,\n1967; Stalnaker 1981, 2008; and Ninan 2013. \n\nCastañeda (1966, 1967) argues that ‘he himself’ and\n‘she herself’ can be used to ascribe first-person\nindexical beliefs and cannot be used to ascribe beliefs that are not\nfirst-person indexical. Consider again the messy shopper, and let\n\\(t_0\\) be the time at which John first utters ‘He is making a\nmess’.  Castañeda would hold that ascription (18) is true\nbut ascription (19) is false. \n\nCastañeda uses the term quasi-indicator for\nexpressions such as ‘he himself’ and ‘she\nherself’ that he claims can be used to ascribe (only) indexical\nbeliefs that the subject would express with a first-person pronoun such\nas ‘I’. Castañeda uses ‘he*’ and\n‘she*’ as abbreviations for ‘he himself’ and\n‘she herself’. \n\nPerry (2000, Chapter 5) argues that belief attributions containing\n‘he himself’ in their ‘that’-clauses do not\nsemantically require that the subject have a first-person belief.\nInstead, utterances of such belief attributions merely suggest that the\nsubject has a first-person belief. Schlenker (2003), however, claims\nthat some languages other than English contain lexical items that are\nquasi-indicators in Castañeda’s sense. \n\nThere are other attitude ascriptions that do not contain ‘he\nhimself’ or ‘she herself’, but which also seem to\nrequire, or at least strongly suggest, that their subjects have\nfirst-person attitudes. Suppose that John is in a pizza parlor, and\nobserves a customer in a mirror who appears to be too thin to be\nhealthy. John points at him in the mirror and sincerely utters ‘I\nwant him to eat a large slice of pizza’. John, however, is not\nfeeling hungry, and so he says ‘I do not want to eat a large\nslice of pizza’. In fact, however, the person that John sees in\nthe mirror is himself. Attribution (20) seems to be true in this\nsituation, whereas attribution (21) seems to be false. \n\nSome theorists would claim that (21) is true only if John has a first-person desire, that is,\na desire that he would naturally express with ‘I want to eat a\nlarge slice of pizza’. Some of these theorists would attribute\nthe seemingly mandatory first-person reading of (21) to the presence of\na silent, pronoun-like expression that serves as a subject for the\nembedded infinitival phrase ‘to eat a slice of pizza’. This\nsort of pronominal expression is often called ‘PRO’. For\ndiscussion, see Dowty 1985, Chierchia 1989, and Cappelen and Dever\n2013. \n\nComplex demonstratives are expressions of the form that \\(N\\)\nor this \\(N\\), where \\(N\\) is a common noun phrase. Examples\ninclude ‘this man’, ‘that red car’, and\n‘that woman who is wearing a blue coat’. One major question\nabout complex demonstratives is whether they are singular\nterms or quantifier phrases. Singular terms are\nexpressions that refer, with respect to contexts, to individuals. Most\nsemantic theories of the simple demonstratives\n‘this’ and ‘that’ treat them as singular terms.\nSpeakers seem to use complex demonstratives to refer to\nindividuals in much the way that they use simple demonstratives. That\nis some reason to think that complex demonstratives are singular terms.\nHowever, complex demonstratives syntactically resemble paradigmatic\nquantifier phrases, such as ‘some woman’ and ‘every\nman’. That is some reason to think that complex demonstratives\nare quantifier phrases. But quantifier phrases are not singular terms;\nthey do not refer, with respect to contexts, to individuals. Their\nreferences, or extensions, with respect to contexts, are usually taken\nto be sets of sets. \n\nSingular-term theories of complex demonstratives must deal with two\nmajor issues. First, do the common noun phrases that appear in complex\ndemonstratives play a role in determining their referents in contexts?\nSecond, do the contents of those common noun phrases contribute to the\ncontents of complex demonstratives, in contexts? (Does, for instance,\nthe content of ‘philosopher’ appear as a constituent of\nthe content of ‘that philosopher’, in a context?)\nMinimal theories assign minimal, or no, semantic role to\ncommon noun phrases in complex demonstratives. The common noun phrase\nmerely gives an auditor a clue as to the speaker’s intended\nreferent. Since the predicate ‘philosopher’ plays no role\nin determining the referent of ‘that philosopher’ in a\ncontext, its referent, in a context, need not be a philosopher.\nFurthermore, the content of ‘philosopher’ is not a\nconstituent of the content of ‘that philosopher’ in a\ncontext; its content simply is its referent in that context. Larson\nand Segal (1995) endorse a minimal theory (but they do not accept the\nexistence of Kaplan-style contents). Intermediate theories\nsay that the common noun phrase helps determine the referent. So, an\nindividual must be a philosopher to be the referent of ‘that\nphilosopher’ in a context. But the common noun phrase does not\ncontribute its content to the complex demonstrative’s content.\nInstead, the content of the complex demonstrative is simply its\nreferent. Kaplan (1989a) hints that he accepts an intermediate theory.\nBraun (1994, 2008), Borg (2000), and Salmon (2002) explicitly argue\nfor intermediate theories. Maximal theories say that the\ncommon noun phrase helps determine the referent, and its content\nappears as a constituent of the content, in a context. Richard (1993)\nendorses a maximal theory. \n\nThe arguments for and against these views are complicated. To take\none example: intermediate theorists might claim that (22) is false in\nsome contexts, and argue that this is incompatible with maximal\ntheories. \n\nBut maximal theorists, if they agree with this judgment about (22),\ncan add rigidifying devices, such as ‘actually’, to obtain\nthis result. \n\nTaylor (1981), King (2001), and Neale (2004) endorse\nquantificational theories of complex demonstratives. For example, on\nKing’s view, the content of (23), in some contexts in which the\nagent perceives Mary and believes Mary to be a philosopher, is\nnecessarily equivalent to the content of (24) in that same context\n(assuming that definite descriptions are quantifier phrases, not\nsingular terms). \n\nThe arguments for and against singular-term theories and quantifier\nphrase theories are (again) complicated. For example, King argues that\nintermediate singular-term theories of complex demonstratives have\ndifficulties dealing with cases of quantifying into complex\ndemonstratives, as in examples like (25) below. \n\nBorg (2000), Lepore and Johnson (2002), Salmon (2002), and Braun\n(2008) respond to King’s argument, and criticize his view. King\ndefends his argument, and his view, in King 2008a and 2008b. \n\nSee Lepore and Ludwig 2000, Dever 2001, Roberts 2002, and Elbourne\n2008 for views of complex demonstratives that do not fit easily into\nthe above classification scheme. \n\nMultiple occurrences of demonstratives present difficulties for some\ntheories. Sentence (26) below contains multiple occurrences of the\ndemonstrative ‘that’. \n\nIn the right circumstances, a speaker could use (26) to assert a\ntrue proposition. This strongly suggests that (26) is true in some\ncontexts. But ‘that’ is unambiguous, and so has a single\nlinguistic meaning. If linguistic meaning determines reference in a\ncontext (in the way that Kaplan’s characters do), then all\noccurrences of ‘that’ in (26) have the same reference with\nrespect to any given context. So, (26) should be false in all\ncontexts. \n\nKaplan’s theories of true demonstratives allow sentences that\nresemble (26) to be false in some contexts, but at the cost of\nattributing a type of ambiguity to ‘that’. For example, on\nhis later indexical theory of demonstratives, some formal analogs of\n(26), such as (27), are true in contexts in which the first\ndemonstratum of the context is distinct from the second. \n\nBut on this theory each subscripted ‘that’ has a\ndifferent character. So this theory does not identify a reasonable\ncandidate for the single linguistic meaning of the unsubscripted\nEnglish word ‘that’. This may be why Kaplan (1989b) speaks\nof the “exotic ambiguity” of demonstratives. \n\nThere are various options for responding to the problem of finding a\nsingle meaning for ‘that’. One could stipulate that each\ncontext has only one demonstratum, and say that the content of\n‘that’ in a context is the demonstratum of the\ncontext, but then insist that the content of a sentence containing\nmultiple occurrences of demonstratives is determined not by a single\ncontext but by a sequence of contexts. Then (26) is true with respect\nto certain sequences of contexts that have different demonstrata.\nSecond, one could distinguish linguistic meaning and character.\n‘That’ has a single linguistic meaning, but this meaning\ndoes not determine reference in a context; linguistic meaning instead\ndetermines the characters of occurrences, and these characters\ndetermine reference in a context. Third, one could move to a theory\nthat assigns contents to utterances rather than expressions.\nThis might help because every utterance of (26) contains two utterances\nof ‘that’. There are other possibilities.
