Newton's contributions to\nmathematics—including the co-discovery of the calculus with his\n(eventual) foe Leibniz—and to what is now called physics,\nincluding both its experimental and theoretical aspects, will forever\ndominate discussions of his lasting influence. But his impact on the\ndevelopment of early modern philosophy was also profound, so much so\nthat it is difficult to grasp the history of philosophy in the late\nseventeenth and early eighteenth centuries without considering\nNewton's role. His engagement with Cartesian ideas and methods early\nin his life was just as significant to the transformation of\nphilosophy in the seventeenth century as his debates with Leibniz were\nto the setting of the agenda of philosophy in the eighteenth.\nObviously, Newton is not part of the traditional canon of the period,\nwhich would focus on the great sextet, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz,\nLocke, Berkeley, and Hume. (The distinction between the two pairs of\nthree “rationalists” and “empiricists” owes\nmuch to the Kantian conception of the history of philosophy in the\nlate eighteenth century.) But this conception of the canon has been\nchallenged substantially by the past generation of scholarship. And\nironically, with the possible exception of Spinoza, Newton engaged\nwith or personally influenced the other five canonical philosophers of\nthe early modern era (cf. Schliesser 2012). Thus Newton's\ncontributions to, and influence on, early modern philosophy is a rich\ntopic.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Newton would be characterized as a mathematician for\nhis work on the calculus and as scientist for his work in physics. His\ncelebrated talent in mathematics is perhaps equaled not only by his\nprofound theorizing concerning the physical world, but also his\ninfluential experimental methods in optics. Indeed, Newton is\nremarkable for the fact that his work as a theoretician is matched by\nhis work as an experimentalist—either aspect of his\noeuvre would be sufficient to secure his place in the history\nof modern science. So in the popular imagination, and in the history\nbooks, Newton is seen as one of the greatest scientists of the modern\nperiod, on a par with few others (perhaps Darwin or Einstein). It is\nunwise to quibble with this perspective, and it is presumably the view\nthat will continue to dominate our understanding of Newton in the\ntwenty-first century. \nIf we attempt to understand Newton's work from an historical point of\nview, however, a different, and more complex, conception\nemerges. There are historical reasons for resisting the temptation to\nthink of Newton as a scientist. For starters, no such category existed\nduring Newton's day: the category of the scientist—along with\nthat word in English—is a nineteenth century invention.\nSpecifically, at a meeting of the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science in June of 1833, the Cambridge philosopher\nWilliam Whewell coined the word “scientist”. At the\nmeeting, Whewell said that just as the practitioners of art are called\n“artists”, the practitioners of science ought to be called\n“scientists”, indicating that they should no longer be\ncalled\n philosophers.[1]\n Indeed, before the early nineteenth\ncentury, people like Newton were called “philosophers”, or\nmore specifically, “natural philosophers”. This might\nappear to be mere semantics, but it is not. During the seventeenth\ncentury, and well into the eighteenth (at least until 1750, if not\nlater), figures like Newton worked within the century's-old tradition\nof natural\n philosophy.[2]\n The modern disciplines of physics,\nchemistry, biology and so on had not yet been formed. Philosophers who\nstudied nature investigated such things as planetary motions and the\npossibility of a vacuum, but they also discussed many aspects of human\nbeings, including the psyche, and how nature reflects its divine\ncreator (Hatfield 1996). As the title of Newton's magnum opus,\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical\nPrinciples of Natural Philosophy), suggests, he intended his work\nto be in dialogue with Descartes's Principia Philosophiae\n(Principles of Philosophy, 1644), a complex text that\nincludes discussions of everything from the laws of nature to the\nnature of God's causal influence on the world. Just as Descartes had\nsought to replace Aristotelian or “Scholastic” methods and\ndoctrines in natural philosophy, Newton sought his work to replace\nDescartes's. It is therefore more historically accurate and more\nilluminating to interpret Newton within the historical stream of\nnatural\n  philosophy.[3] \nAs is well known, natural philosophy in the Aristotelian traditions of\nthe thirteenth through the sixteenth centuries involved an analysis of\nAristotle's ideas about the natural world, especially within the\nChristianized context of the medieval period. Philosophers studying\nnature were often actually studying texts—such as commentaries\non Aristotle—rather than conducting experiments or engaging in\nobservations, and they often did not employ mathematical techniques.\nTraditionally, natural philosophy in Aristotelian circles was not\nconceived of as a mathematical discipline (unlike, say, optics or\nastronomy); instead, it focused especially on the natures of objects\nand on causation. In the seventeenth century, natural philosophers\nlike Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, and Newton began to reject not only\nthe doctrines of the Aristotelians, but their techniques as well,\ndeveloping a number of new mathematical, conceptual and experimental\nmethods. Newton respected Descartes's rejection of Aristotelian ideas,\nbut argued that Cartesians did not employ enough of the mathematical\ntechniques of Galileo, or of the experimental methods of Boyle, in\ntrying to understand nature. Of course, these developments have often\nbeen regarded as central to the so-called Scientific\nRevolution. Despite the centrality of these changes during the\nseventeenth century, however, the scope of natural philosophy\nhad not dramatically changed. Natural philosophers like Newton\nexpended considerable energy trying to understand, e.g., the nature of\nmotion, but they regarded that endeavor as a component of an\noverarching enterprise that also included an analysis of the divine\nbeing. Newton was a natural philosopher—unlike Descartes, he was\nnot a founder of modern philosophy, for he never wrote a treatise of\nthe order of the Meditations. Nonetheless, his\ninfluence on philosophy in the eighteenth century was\nprofound, extending well beyond the bounds of philosophers studying\nnature, encompassing numerous figures and traditions in Britain, on\nthe Continent, and even in the New \nWorld.[4]\n Newton's influence has at least two salient\naspects. \nFirst, Newton's achievement in the Opticks and in the\nPrincipia was understood to be of such philosophical import\nthat few philosophers in the eighteenth century ignored it. Most of\nthe canonical philosophers in this period sought to interpret various\nof Newton's epistemic claims within the terms of their own systems,\nand many saw the coherence of their own views with those of Newton as\na criterion of philosophical excellence. Early in the century,\nBerkeley grappled with Newton's work on the calculus in The\nAnalyst (1734) and with his dynamics in De Motu (1721),\nand he even mentioned gravity, the paradigmatic Newtonian force, in\nhis popular work Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous\n(1713). When Berkeley lists what philosophers take to be the so-called\nprimary qualities of material bodies in the Dialogues, he\nremarkably adds “gravity” to the more familiar list of\nsize, shape, motion, and solidity, thereby suggesting that the\nreceived view of material bodies had already changed before the second\nedition of the Principia had circulated widely. Hume\ninterpreted Newtonian natural philosophy in an empiricist vein and\nnoted some of its broader implications in his Treatise of Human\nNature (1739) and Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\n(1750). Newton's work also served as the impetus for the extremely\ninfluential correspondence between Leibniz and the Newtonian Samuel\nClarke early in the century, a correspondence that proved significant\neven for thinkers writing toward the century's end. Unlike the vis\nviva controversy and other disputes between the Cartesians and\nthe Leibnizians, which died out by the middle of the century, the\ndebate between the Leibnizians and the Newtonians remained\nphilosophically salient for decades, serving as the impetus for Emilie\nDu Châtelet's influential work during the French Enlightenment,\nFoundations of Physics (1740), and also as one of the driving\nforces behind Kant's development of the “critical”\nphilosophy during the 1770s, culminating in the Critique of Pure\nReason (1781). In addition, Newton's work spawned an immense\ncommentarial literature in English, French, and Latin, including John\nKeill's Introduction to Natural Philosophy (1726), Henry\nPemberton's A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy (1728),\nVoltaire's Elements of the Philosophy of Newton (1738),\nWillem 's Gravesande's Mathematical Elements of Natural\nPhilosophy (1747), Colin MacLaurin's An Account of Sir Isaac\nNewton's Philosophical Discoveries (1748), which probably\ninfluenced Hume, and Du Châtelet's and Clairaut's commentary on\nNewton's Principia (1759). These and other commentaries were\nprinted in various editions, were translated into various languages,\nand were often influential. \nA second aspect of Newton's influence involves thinkers who attempted\nin one way or another to articulate, follow, or extend, the Newtonian\n“method” in natural philosophy when treating issues and\nquestions that Newton ignored. Euclidean geometry and its methods were\nseen as a fundamental epistemic model for much of seventeenth-century\nphilosophy—as is well known, Descartes' Meditations\nattempts to achieve a type of certainty he likens to that found in\ngeometry, and Spinoza wrote his Ethics according to the\n“geometrical method”. Propositions deduced from theorems\nin Euclidean geometry were seen as paradigm cases of knowledge. We\nmight see Newton's work as providing eighteenth-century philosophy\nwith one of its primary models, and with a series of epistemic\nexemplars as well, but part of philosophy's task was to articulate\nprecisely what the new Newtonian method essentially involved. David\nHume is perhaps clearest about this aspect of Newton's influence. His\nTreatise of 1739 has the subtitle: “An Attempt to\nIntroduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning Into Moral\nSubjects”, and there can be little doubt that he meant (at least\nin part) the method of the Opticks and the Principia\n(DePierris 2012). Indeed, as Hume's text makes abundantly clear,\nvarious eighteenth-century philosophers, including not only Hume in\nScotland but Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the Continent, were taken to be,\nor attempted to become, “the Newton of the \nmind”.[5] \nFor Hume, this meant\nfollowing what he took to be Newton's empirical method by providing\nthe proper description of the relevant natural phenomena and then\nfinding the most general principles that account for them (of course,\none aspect of Hume's work is to provide an analysis of the concept of\ncausation that is far more extensive than anything found in Newton,\nwhich has a substantial impact on what counts as an\n“account” of a phenomenon). This method would allow us to\nachieve the highest level of knowledge attainable in the realm of what\nHume calls “matters of\n fact”.[6] \nDespite the influence of Newton's “method” on\neighteenth-century philosophy, it is obvious that the\nPrincipia's greater impact on the eighteenth century is to\nhave effected a branching within natural philosophy that led to the\ndevelopment of mathematical physics on the one hand, and philosophy on\nthe other. And yet to achieve an understanding of how Newton himself\napproached natural philosophy, we must carefully bracket such\nhistorical developments—they did not solidify until at least\n1750, a generation after Newton's death. Indeed, if we resist the\ntemptation to understand Newton as working within a well established\ndiscipline called mathematical physics, if we see him instead as a\nphilosopher studying nature, his achievement is far more impressive, for\ninstead of contributing to a well-founded field of physics, he had to\nbegin a process that would eventually lead aspects of natural\nphilosophy to be transformed into a new field of study. This\ntransformation took many decades, and involved a series of\nmethodological and foundational debates about the proper means for\nobtaining knowledge about nature and its processes. Newton himself not\nonly engaged in these debates from his very first publication in\noptics in 1672, his work in both optics and in the Principia\ngenerated some of the most significant methodological discussions and\ncontroversies in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.\nThese debates concerned such topics as the proper use of hypotheses,\nthe nature of space and time, and the appropriate rules for conducting\nresearch in natural philosophy. Newton's achievement was in part to\nhave vanquished both Cartesian and Leibnizian approaches to natural\nphilosophy; in the later eighteenth century, and indeed much of the\nnineteenth, physics was largely a Newtonian enterprise. But this\nachievement, from Newton's own perspective, involved an extensive,\nlife-long series of philosophical debates. Those debates focused on\nnumerous substantive issues, but also included extensive discussions\nof the proper methodology in natural philosophy. \n\nPhilosophers have long known about various aspects of Newton's work\nthat are salient for understanding debates in the early modern\nperiod. For instance, no history of debates about the ontology of\nspace and time would exclude a discussion of Newton's famous\nconception of “absolute” space (see below). Similarly, any\ndiscussion of the role of hypotheses in philosophical reasoning would\nmention Newton prominently. These aspects of Newton's work continue to\nbe significant in contemporary scholarship, but the scope of\ndiscussions of Newton has greatly expanded, encompassing the whole of\nNewton's mature intellectual life. This is especially evident in\ndiscussions of Newton's earliest published work, which was in the\nfield of optics. In at least three relevant respects, Newton's early\nwork in optics, which was published in the Philosophical\nTransactions of the Royal Society beginning in 1672, set the\nstage for the principal themes of his long career in natural\nphilosophy (he remained active well into his seventies). Firstly,\nNewton's letter to the Society's secretary, Henry Oldenburg, often\ncalled the “New theory about light and colors”, generated\nan immediate, extensive, and protracted debate that eventually\ninvolved important philosophers such as Robert Hooke in Britain and\nChristiaan Huygens, G.W. Leibniz and Ignatius Pardies on the Continent\n(the beginning of the very long title of the paper is: “A letter\nof Mr. Isaac Newton, Mathematick Professor in the University of\nCambridge, containing his New Theory about Light and\nColors”). Newton consistently regarded these figures not merely\nas disagreeing with his views, but as misinterpreting them. This\nexperience helped to shape Newton's famous and lifelong aversion to\nintellectual controversy, a feature of his personality that he often\nmentioned in letters, and one that he would never outgrow. Secondly,\nbecause Newton regarded himself as misinterpreted by his critics, he\nhad recourse to meta-level or methodological discussions of the\npractice of optics and of the kinds of knowledge that philosophers can\nobtain when engaging in experiments with light. The novelty and power\nof Newton's work in the Principia years later would\neventually generate similar controversies that led him to analogous\nkinds of methodological discussions of his experimental practice\nwithin natural philosophy and of the kinds of knowledge that one can\nobtain in that field using either experimental or mathematical\ntechniques. From our point of view, Newton's science was\nunusually philosophical for these reasons. Thirdly and finally, in his\nearliest optical work Newton began to formulate a distinction that\nwould remain salient throughout his long intellectual career,\ncontending that a philosopher must distinguish between a conclusion or\nclaim about some feature of nature that is derived from experimental\nor observational evidence, and a conclusion or claim that is a mere\n“hypothesis”, a kind of speculation about nature that is\nnot, or not yet anyway, so derived.  Newton's much later proclamation\nin the second edition of the Principia (1713),\n“Hypotheses non fingo”, or “I feign no\nhypotheses”, would infuriate his critics just as much as it\nwould prod his followers into making the pronouncement a central\ncomponent of a newly emerging Newtonian method (see below for\ndetails). \nThe field of optics has its origins in the Ancient Greek period, when\nfigures like Euclid and Ptolemy wrote works on the subject, but they\noften focused primarily on the science of vision, analyzing (e.g.)\nthe visual rays that were sometimes thought to extrude from the eye,\nenabling it to perceive distant physical objects. In the early modern\nperiod, Kepler and Descartes each made fundamental contributions to\nthe field, including the discovery of the inversion of the retinal\nimage (in the former case) and an explanation of refraction (in the\nlatter case). Newton's work helped to shift the focus of optics from\nan analysis of vision to an investigation of light. In “New\ntheory about light and colors”, published in the\nPhilosophical Transactions in 1672, Newton presented a number\nof experiments in which sunlight was allowed to pass through one or two\nprisms in order to probe some of its basic features. The paper\nrecounts a number of experiments that Newton says he had conducted\nseveral years earlier.  But what precisely counts as a\nfeature of light? Numerous philosophers during the\nseventeenth century, including Hooke and Huygens, developed doctrines\nconcerning the fundamental physical nature of light in answer to the\nquestion: is light a stream of particles (or\n“corpuscles”), or is it a wave? Both Hooke and Huygens\nwere wave theorists. This question obviously continued to have\nrelevance into the twentieth century, when wave-particle duality was\ndiscovered.  In his experiments with the prism, however, Newton\napparently sought to investigate something else, viz. what he calls\n“the celebrated Phenomena of Colours”. Newton's\nvarious prism experiments, which he describes in considerable depth,\nsuggested to him a “Doctrine” that he expresses in\nthirteen consecutive numbered propositions. Included in these\npropositions are the following claims about features of rays of light:\nfirst, the rays of light that emerge when sunlight passes through a\nprism exhibit various colors; second, these colors differ in their\n“degrees of Refrangibility”, which means that they exhibit\nand retain an index of refraction, even when they are passed through a\nsecond prism; third, these colors—or colorful rays—are not\nmodifications of sunlight itself, but rather are\n“Original and connate properties” of it;\nand, fourth, these facts mean that although ordinary sunlight appears\nwhite, or perhaps colorless, to our perception, it actually contains\nnumerous colors within it, which can be experimentally revealed. This\nfinal point suggests, in turn, that from Newton's point of view,\ncolors are not solely perceived, or even perceptible, aspects of\nphysical objects; they can also be conceived of as hidden features of\nlight which cannot be perceived directly under any ordinary\ncircumstance (the physical influence of the prism is required for them\nto become perceptible).  From a contemporary point of view, Newton's 1672 paper exhibits an\nintriguing blend of experimental evidence and philosophical\nargumentation. The latter hinges on Newton's interpretation of the\nconcept of a property or a quality, as the following passage, which\nfollows the “Doctrine” expressed in thirteen propositions,\ntellingly reveals: \n\nThese things being so, it can be no longer disputed, whether there be\ncolours in the dark, nor whether they be the qualities of the objects\nwe see, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours\nare the qualities of Light, having its Rays for their entire\nand immediate subject, how can we think those Rays qualities\nalso, unless one quality may be the subject of and sustain another;\nwhich in effect is to call it substance. We should not know\nBodies for substances, were it not for their sensible qualities, and\nthe Principal of those being now found due to something else, we have\nas good reason to believe that to be a substance also. (Newton\n1959–, vol. 1: 100) \nNewton seems to be arguing as follows here: since rays of light have\ncolors as basic features, we should regard these colors as qualities\nor properties of the rays (despite the fact that these properties are\nimperceptible under any ordinary circumstance); but doing so requires\nus to think of the rays as bearers of qualities, which is to say, as\nsubstances in their own right. And if rays of light are substances,\nthis means that we cannot also think of them as qualities or\nproperties of anything else. This last point follows from a widely\naccepted notion of a substance at the time, one easily found in\n Descartes[7],\nviz., that substances are those items that can exist independently of\nother items (whether they can exist independently even of God is a\nfurther question that we can ignore here). And if we cannot think of\nrays of light as properties or qualities, then they are not waves, for\nwaves are features of some medium—think of waves on the surface\nof a lake. Newton concludes: light must be a stream of\nparticles. Clearly, philosophical argumentation is a significant\naspect of Newton's reasoning in this paper, as are various\nphilosophical concepts. It is intriguing to ponder the question, what\noverall conception of “sensible qualities” does Newton\npresuppose in this piece? If a ray of sunlight passes through my\nwindow, the fact that it appears perfectly white to me does not\nundermine Newton's view (or so he thinks) that the ray actually\ncontains a series of colors as its “qualities”. Are these\nqualities “sensible” if their presence can be detected\nonly through the use of one or more prisms and never through the\ninspection of the sunlight through ordinary means (unaided perception,\nglasses, a magnifying glass, etc.)?  These are apt to strike us as\ncanonical philosophical problems. \nNewton's line of argument quoted above became one of the centerpieces\nof the debate that his paper generated. In some parts of his paper,\nwhen Newton wrote of the “rays” of light, he had evidently\nintended to remain neutral on the question of whether the rays are\nparticles or waves (this is reminiscent of the ancient Greek practice\nof avoiding physical discussions of visual rays). But then towards the\npaper's end, Newton added his new line of argument, which employed\nsome philosophical analysis together with some experimental evidence\nto support the conclusion that rays of light cannot be waves after\nall. Newton's critics pounced. This led to the first problem he\nencountered in response to his paper: what he calls his\n“theory” of light and colors was not merely rejected, but\nrather immediately misunderstood, at least from his own\nperspective. Just days after Newton's paper was read at the Royal\nSociety, Robert Hooke responded with a detailed letter to\nOldenburg. In the first few sentences, Hooke indicates that from his\npoint of view, Newton's “Hypothesis of saving the phenomena of\ncolours” essentially involves the contention that rays of light\nare particulate, rather than\n wavelike.[8] \nHooke argues, in contrast, that light\n“is nothing but a pulse or motion propagated through an\nhomogeneous, uniform and transparent medium;” that is, he argues\nthat light is indeed wavelike. He makes it perfectly clear, moreover,\nthat his hypothesis—the name did not carry a negative\nconnotation in his work—can save the phenomena of colors just as\nwell as Newton's, which is to say, his hypothesis is compatible with\nthe experimental evidence Newton gathers. Evidently, the line of\nargument in the passage quoted above caught Hooke's eye. Among\nphilosophers, he was not alone. In a letter to Huygens explaining\nNewton's theory of light, Leibniz writes that Newton takes light to be\na “body” propelled from the sun to the earth which,\naccording to Leibniz, Newton takes to explain both the differential\nrefrangibility of rays of light and the phenomena of \ncolors.[9] \nSince Newton had\nemployed the concepts of substance, quality and sensible quality when\nconcluding in his paper that light is (presumably) particulate, we are\napt to regard the paper as contributing to important discussions\nwithin philosophy. After the extensive correspondence, and\ncontroversy, generated in response to Newton's early optical views and\nexperiments, he often threatened to avoid engaging in mathematical and\nphilosophical disputes altogether. He insisted to friends and\ncolleagues that he found intellectual controversy unbearable. But he\nnever followed through with his threat to disengage from discussions\nin natural philosophy, and sent many important letters throughout his\nlong intellectual career. \nLike many philosophers who worked in the wake of Galileo and of\nDescartes, it seems that Newton never extensively analyzed\nAristotelian ideas about nature. He would have encountered such ideas\nin the curriculum at Trinity College, but there is not much evidence\nthat he took them seriously. Instead, he focused on the\n“modern” thinkers that enterprising young students were\ntold to read outside of the standard \ncurriculum.[10] \nAnd in England in\nNewton's day, the greatest modern philosopher of nature was thought to\nbe Descartes (Heilbron 1982: 30). There is substantial evidence that\nNewton took Descartes's ideas very seriously, and expended\nconsiderable energy thinking them through and eventually coming to\ncriticize them. Much of that evidence comes from a manuscript that was\nfirst transcribed and published in 1962 by the great historians of\nscience, Marie Boas Hall and Rupert Hall. The manuscript, which is now\nknown as “De Gravitatione”, after its first line,\nhas been the subject of extensive discussions over the past fifty\nyears because it indicates the depth of Newton's interest in Cartesian\nideas in metaphysics and natural philosophy.  Despite its importance\nto contemporary understandings of Newton's relation to Cartesianism,\nand much else besides, De Gravitatione is not without its\nproblems. First and foremost, the manuscript lacks a date, and there\nis no scholarly consensus regarding that\n issue.[11]\n Second, the\nmanuscript was never finished, so it is difficult to assess its\nrelationship with Newton's mature thinking in philosophy.  Finally,\nthe manuscript was not published during Newton's lifetime, so there\nare questions about whether it represents his considered\nviews. Despite these facts, the text contains a treasure trove of\nargument concerning Cartesian ideas. It therefore helps to dispel the\neasily formed impression that Newton sought, in the\nPrincipia, to undermine a Leibnizian conception of space and\ntime, as his defender, Samuel Clarke, would attempt to do years later\nin the correspondence of 1715–16 (discussed below). Although\nLeibniz did eventually express what became the canonical early modern\nformulation of “relationalism” concerning space and\ntime—the view, roughly, that space is nothing but the order of\nrelations among physical objects, and time nothing over and above the\nsuccession of events involving those objects—and although Newton\nand Clarke were highly skeptical of such a view, it is misleading to\nread the Principia through the lens provided by the later\ncontroversy with the Leibnizians. Newton's extensive attempt in De\nGravitatione to refute Descartes's conception of space and time in\nparticular indicates that the Scholium should be read as providing a\nreplacement for the Cartesian\n conception.[12]\n That is, Newton had a Cartesian, and not\na Leibnizian, opponent primarily in mind when he wrote his famous\narticulation of “absolutism” concerning space and time.\nUnlike questions about Newton's methods and his apparent deviation\nfrom the norms established by mechanist philosophers like Descartes\nand Boyle, Newton's conception of space and time, along with his view\nof the divine being, did not immediately engender a philosophical\ndebate. It was Leibniz more than any other philosopher who eventually\nsucceeded in fomenting a philosophical debate in which the\n“Newtonian” conception of space, time and the divine would\nplay a central role (see below). But Leibniz's philosophical views\nwere relatively unknown when Newton first formed his conception;\ninstead, it was Descartes's view of space, the world, and God, which\nhe pondered in his youth and eventually came to reject. \nNewton took special interest in the Cartesian view of space, and in\nrelated views concerning the causal relations between minds and\nbodies, and between God and the bodies that constitute the natural\nworld. Like many of Newton's contemporaries in Cambridge in those\ndays, he encountered these Cartesian views within the context of Henry\nMore's then famous discussions of Cartesianism (a term coined by More\nhimself). Beginning with his correspondence with Descartes in 1648\n(Lewis 1953), and continuing with a series of publications in later\nyears, many of which Newton owned in his personal library (Harrison\n1978), More argued that Descartes made two fundamental mistakes:\nfirst, he wrongly contended that extension and matter are identical\n(and that the world is therefore a plenum); and second, he mistakenly\nbelieved that God and the mind were not extended substances, which\nmade their causal interactions with such substances mysterious. Just\nas Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia raised fundamental objections to\nCartesian dualism, More raised similar objections against the\nCartesian view of the divine (see Shapiro 2007). Descartes agreed with\nMore's suggestion that God can act anywhere on nature if he so\nchooses, and came very close to accepting More's contention that such\na view entails that God must be present within the world wherever he\nin fact chooses to act. For how could God part the Red Sea, suggested\nMore, unless God were present precisely where the Red Sea is located?\nOf course, More agreed that God is not made of parts, cannot be\nimagined, and cannot be affected by the causal activity of material\nbodies—the causal arrow flows only in one direction. But More\nconcluded that God is extended in his own way. If one fixes\nDescartes's two basic mistakes, one obtains what More regarded as a\nproper philosophical view: space is distinct from matter because it is\nextended but penetrable, whereas matter is extended but impenetrable;\nand, in tandem, all substances are extended, but whereas some, such as\ntables and chairs, are impenetrable, others, such as the mind and even\nGod, are penetrable and therefore not\n material.[13] \n Newton was deeply\ninfluenced both by More's criticisms of Descartes and by his positive\nphilosophical conception of space and the divine. \nIn a number of texts, including De Gravitatione, the famous\ndiscussion of space and time in the Scholium to the\nPrincipia, and the discussion of God in the General Scholium,\nNewton made his generally Morean attitudes perfectly clear. He\nrejected the Cartesian identification of extension and matter, arguing\nthat space itself exists independently of material objects (and their\nrelations), and he contended that all entities, including the human\nmind and even the divine being, are extended in the sense that they\nhave spatial location, even if they are extended in ways that\ndistinguish them from ordinary material\n bodies.[14]\n In Newton's hands,\nspace becomes a fundamental concept of natural philosophy, an attitude\nthat is foreign to Cartesians and (later) objectionable to\nLeibnizians. As Newton puts it in a famous passage from De\nGravitatione: \nSpace is an affection of a being just as a being. No being exists or\ncan exist which is not related to space in some way. God is every\nwhere, created minds are somewhere, and body is in the space that it\noccupies; and whatever is neither everywhere nor anywhere does not\nexist. And hence it follows that space is an emanative effect of the\nfirst existing being, for if any being whatsoever is posited, space is\nposited. (Newton 2004: 25) \n\nSpace is a fundamental concept in part because Newton not only\nconceives of it as independent of objects and their relations, but\nbecause he argues that every entity must somehow connect with space in\nsome way. For Newton, then, if one follows the Cartesians and thinks\nof the mind, or of God, as existing without any spatial\nlocation—as existing either “beyond” the natural\nworld or somehow outside of it—then that is equivalent to\nconceiving of them as non-existent. Newton does not shy away from\nmaking this conception of the divine explicit in his public writings,\ndespite the fact that it was anathema to his Cartesian and Leibnizian\ncontemporaries. In the General Scholium to the Principia,\nwhich was added to the second edition of the text in 1713, for\ninstance, he famously writes of God:   He endures\nalways and is present everywhere, and by existing always and\neverywhere he constitutes duration and space. Since each and every\nparticle of space is always, and each and every indivisible\nmoment of duration is everywhere, certainly the maker and\nlord of all things will not be never or nowhere\n… God is one and the same God always and everywhere. He is\nomnipresent not only virtually but also\nsubstantially; for active power cannot subsist without\nsubstance. (Newton 1999: 941) \nFor Newton, just as bodies are present in some spatial location, God,\nan infinite being, is present throughout all of space throughout all\nof time. There could not be a clearer expression of agreement with\nMore in his debate with the Cartesians concerning the substantial\npresence of the divine within space. \nNewton also took issue with Cartesian ideas about motion. His\nrejection of Cartesian views of space, and his embrace of space as a\nfundamental concept in philosophy following More's influence, aligns\nwith his famous discussion of space and time in the Scholium that\nfollows the opening definitions in the Principia. This text\ninfluenced nearly every subsequent philosophical discussion of space\nand time for the next three centuries, so its contours are well known\n(see DiSalle 2006: ch. 2). In his Principles of Philosophy of\n1644, Descartes had distinguished between the “ordinary”\nand the “proper” view of motion: whereas the ordinary view\npresents motion as a body's change of place, the philosopher knows\nthat properly speaking, motion is a body's change of relations to the\nbodies that surround it (recall Descartes's plenum). Newton contends\nin De Gravitatione that this idea of proper motion, according\nto which the motion of a body is at least partially a function of its\nrelations to other bodies, is in tension with Descartes's own laws of\nnature, also presented in the Principles. For according to\nthe conception of (what we now call) inertia that Descartes presents as his first two\nlaws, a body moving rectilinearly will continue to do so unless caused\nto deviate from its path—hence a body's motion is not a function\nof its spatial relations to other bodies, but rather of its\ncausal relations.  That is, according to the first two laws,\nchanging a body's spatial relations to others bodies will not alter\nits rectilinear motion unless a causal interaction occurs. This\ntension runs deep in the Cartesian system. Newton's Scholium reflects\nhis idea that the concept of motion in the Principia ought to\ncohere with the laws of motion he endorses. He distinguishes between \nabsolute and relative motion, true and apparent motion, and\nmathematical and common motion (the same distinctions hold for time,\nspace and place), and the former item in each of these three pairings\nis a concept that coheres with the laws of motion. Newton's first law\nreflects Descartes's laws: it is a new version of the principle of\ninertia, one incorporating the concept of an impressed force. Since\nthis law indicates that a body's motion is not a function of its\nspatial relations to other bodies, but rather of whether forces are\nimpressed on it—which replaces the Cartesian concept of causal\ninteractions that involve only impact (see below)—Newton cannot\nrely on a body's motion relative to other bodies if he is to avoid the\nkind of tension he found in the Cartesian view. Hence he indicates\nthat a body's true motion—rather than its apparent motion, which\ndepends on our perceptions, or its relative motion, which depends on\nits spatial relations—is a body's change of position within\nspace itself. That is, true motion should be understood as absolute\nmotion. This means, in turn, that we must distinguish between the\ncommon idea of space, according to which space is conceived of as\ninvolving relations among various objects (like the space of our air),\nand the mathematical idea, one presumably obtained from geometry or\ngeometrical reasoning, that space is independent of any objects or\ntheir relations. In order to account for the idea that true motion is\nabsolute motion, then, the famous “absolute space” is\npostulated. \nNewton was perfectly well aware that the notion of absolute space is\nnot\n unproblematic.[15]\n For instance, if a body's true motion\njust is its absolute motion, its motion with respect to space\nitself, then the imperceptibility of space would appear to render any\ndetection of true motion difficult, if not hopeless. Indeed, how would\nwe detect any body's true motion on this view? We might be able to\ndetect a body's changing spatial relations with its neighbors, but not\nits changing relationship with space itself! Newton's solution to this\nproblem is ingenious. Under certain circumstances, we can detect a\nbody's true motion by detecting its acceleration. We can do so when\nthe body is rotating or has a circular motion, for such motions often\nhave detectable effects. This is one way of understanding what has\nbecome one of the most famous, if not infamous,\ngedankenexperimenten of the early modern period, Newton's\nbucket. If one takes an ordinary bucket and fills it with water, and\nthen attaches a rope to the top of the bucket, one can then twist the\nrope and let it go in order to make the bucket spin.  When the bucket\nfull of water spins around, we can detect the water's acceleration by\nits changing surface. As Newton puts it, using some concepts from his\nlaws of motion, the water endeavors to recede from the axis of its\nmotion (hence its changing surface). In this way, despite the fact\nthat Newton wishes to conceive of the water's true motion as its\nabsolute motion within space itself, which cannot be perceived, he\nshows his readers how they might detect the water's true motion\nthrough its effects. Newton provides another\ngedankenexperiment to illustrate a similar point. If two\nballs are joined together by a rope and then spun around, say over\none's head, then the changing tension in the rope will indicate that\nthe balls are accelerated. Since any acceleration is a true\nmotion—although not all true motions are accelerations, since a\nso-called inertial motion is not—this case indicates that we can\ndetect a body's true motion even though space itself is\nimperceptible. In this way, Newton did not merely develop an\nalternative to the Cartesian view of motion, along with its allied\nconception of space; he presented a view that could be employed to\npick out some of the true motions of objects within nature. Once one\nhas found a true motion, one can then ask what caused that\nmotion (for Newton, as we will see, it is forces that are understood\nto cause motions). As the last line of the Scholium in the\nPrincipia indicates, that is one reason that Newton wrote his\nmagnum opus in the first place. \nNewton's idea of space, then, fulfilled at least two roles.  First, it\nenabled him to avoid the tension between the concept of true motion\nand the laws of motion of the kind found in Descartes. Second, it also\nenabled him to articulate what he took to be God's relation to the\nnatural world. Many regarded his achievements as an important advance\nover the Cartesian system. However, it would be a mistake to think\nthat Newton vanquished Cartesian ideas within his lifetime: even in\nEngland, and certainly on the Continent, Cartesianism remained a\npowerful philosophical force for several decades after Newton\npublished his primary\n works.[16]\n Typically, however, Descartes's followers\nemphasized the importance of his ideas about the mechanisms that\npervade nature rather than his views of space and time. In that arena,\nNewton's views were especially prominent, and came in for significant\ncriticism from Leibniz. \n\nMany legends concerning momentous events in history are apocryphal,\nbut the legend of Halley's visit to Newton in 1684 is true, and\nexplains what prompted Newton to write his magnum opus. In\nAugust of 1684, Edmond Halley—for whom the comet is\nnamed—came to visit Newton in Cambridge in order to discover his\nopinion about a subject of much dispute in celestial mechanics. At\nthis time, many in the Royal Society and elsewhere were at work on a\ncluster of problems that might be described as follows: how can one\ntake Kepler's Laws, which were then considered among the very best\ndescriptions of the planetary orbits, and understand them in the\ncontext of dynamical or causal principles? What kind of cause would\nlead to planetary orbits of the kind described by Kepler? In\nparticular, Halley asked Newton the following question: what kind of\ncurve would a planet describe in its orbit around the Sun if it were\nacted upon by an attractive force that was inversely proportional to\nthe square of its distance from the Sun? Newton immediately replied\nthat the curve would be an ellipse (rather than, say, a\ncircle).[17]\nHalley was amazed that Newton had the answer at the ready. But Newton\nalso said that he had mislaid the paper on which the relevant\ncalculations had been made, so Halley left empty handed (whether there\nwas any such paper is a subject of dispute). But he would not be\ndisappointed for long. In November of that year, Newton sent Halley a\nnine-page paper, entitled De Motu (on motion), that presented\nthe sought-after demonstration, along with several other advances in\ncelestial mechanics. Halley was delighted, and immediately returned to\nCambridge for further discussion. It was these events that\nprecipitated the many drafts of De Motu that eventually\nbecame Principia mathematica by 1686. Several aspects of the\nPrincipia have been central to philosophical discussions\nsince its first publication, including Newton's novel methodology in\nthe book, his conception of space and time, and his attitude toward\nthe dominant orientation within natural philosophy in his day, the\nso-called mechanical philosophy, which had important methodological\nconsequences. \nWhen Newton wrote the Principia between 1684 and 1686, he was\nnot contributing to a preexisting field of study called mathematical\nphysics; he was attempting to show how philosophers could employ\nvarious mathematical and experimental methods in order to reach\nconclusions about nature, especially about the motions of material\nbodies. In his lectures presented as the Lucasian Professor at\nCambridge, Newton had been arguing since at least 1670 that natural\nphilosophers had to employ geometrical methods in order to understand\nvarious phenomena in \n nature.[18]\n The Principia represented his\nattempt to reorient natural philosophy, taking it in a direction that\nneither his Aristotelian predecessors, nor his Cartesian\ncontemporaries, had envisioned. He did not immediately convince many\nof them of the benefits of his approach.  Just as his first\npublication in optics in 1672 sparked an intense debate about the\nproper methods for investigating the nature of light—and much\nelse besides—his Principia sparked an even longer\nlasting discussion about the methodology that philosophers should\nadopt when studying the natural world. This discussion began\nimmediately with the publication of the Principia, despite\nthe fact that its first edition contained few explicit methodological\nremarks (Smith 2002: 138–39) and it intensified considerably\nwith the publication of its second edition in 1713, which contained\nmany more remarks about methodology, including many attempts at\ndefending the Newtonian method. Indeed, many of Newton's alterations\nin that edition changed the presentation of his methods. Discussions\nof methodology would eventually involve nearly all of the leading\nphilosophers in England and on the Continent during Newton's\nlifetime. \nIn Cartesian natural philosophy, all natural change is due to the\nimpacts that material bodies make upon one another's surfaces (this is\nreflected in Descartes's first two laws of nature). The concept of a\nforce plays little if any role. Unlike Descartes, Newton placed the\nconcept of a force at the very center of his thinking about motion and\nits causes within nature. In that regard, his reactions to the\nshortcomings of Cartesian natural philosophy parallel Leibniz's, who\ncoined the term “dynamics”, and who obviously regarded\nforce as a fundamental concept in metaphysics as well (Westfall\n1971). But Newton's attitude toward understanding the forces of nature\ninvolved an especially intricate method that generated intense\nscrutiny and debate amongst many philosophers and mathematicians,\nincluding Leibniz (Garber 2012). Newton's canonical notion of a force,\nwhich he calls a vis impressa or “impressed\nforce”, is the notion of an “action exerted on a\nbody” that changes its state of motion. This was a confusing\nnotion at the time. Perhaps it is not difficult to see why that should\nbe so. To take one of Newton's own examples: suppose I hit a tennis\nball with my racquet—according to Newton, I have impressed a\nforce on the tennis ball, for I have changed its state of motion\n(hopefully!). We have a reasonably good idea of what the tennis ball\nis, of what the racquet is, and even of what I am, and a Cartesian\nmight wish to stop her analysis there. But what exactly is this\n“force” that I impressed on the tennis ball? The ball, the\nracquet and I are physical things of one sort or another, but is the\nforce physical? Is it not physical? It does not seem likely that a\nforce is itself a physical thing in the sense of being a substance, to\nuse a philosophical notion popular in Newton's day (as we saw above in\nhis first optics paper). The reason is that in Definition Four in the\nPrincipia, which defines an impressed force for the first\ntime, Newton remarks: “This force consists solely in the action\nand does not remain in a body after the action has ceased”. So\nwhen I hit the tennis ball over the net, the force I impressed on it\nwas the action of hitting the ball, or an action associated with\nhitting the ball, and not a property of me or of the ball after the\naction had ceased. This idea confused many of Newton's readers.  By\nthe mid-eighteenth century, the time of Hume's analysis of causation\nin the Treatise and the Enquiry, many philosophers\nstarted to think that actions and other kinds of event are important\nitems to have in one's ontology, and they often contended in\nparticular that causal relations hold between events. But in\nNewton's day, philosophers typically regarded objects or substances as\nthe causal relata (one finds an equivocation between thinking of\nevents and thinking of objects as the relevant causal relata even in\nHume). So actions were difficult to analyze or often left out of\nanalyses. As a result, Newton's conception of force proved\nconfusing. Moreover, it was unclear to many of Newton's mechanist\nreaders how his forces fit into their rather austere ontological view\nthat material bodies consist solely of properties such as size, shape,\nmobility and solidity. \nNewton did try to clarify his method of characterizing forces. If one\nbrackets the question of how to understand forces as ephemeral actions\nthat do not persist after causal interactions have ceased, one can\nmake progress by conceiving of forces as quantities. In\nparticular, since Newton's eight definitions and three laws indicate\nthat forces are proportional to mass and to acceleration, and since\nmass—or the quantity of matter, a concept Newton transformed\nfrom its Cartesian origins, where it was understood as a measure of a\nbody's volume—and acceleration are both quantities that can be\nmeasured, Newton gives us a means of measuring forces. This is crucial\nto his method. If one thinks of forces as measurable quantities,\nmoreover, then one can attempt to identify two seemingly disparate\nforces as in fact the same force through thinking about measuring\nthem. For instance, in Book III of the Principia, Newton\nfamously argues in proposition five and its scholium that the\ncentripetal force maintaining the planetary orbits is in fact the same\nas the force of gravity, viz., the force that causes the free fall of\nobjects on earth. This was a revolutionary idea at the time, one\nrendered possible in the first place by Newton's way of thinking about\nforces as quantities. This idea then led Newton to the even more\nrevolutionary view in proposition seven of Book III that all bodies\ngravitate toward one another in proportion to their quantity of\nmatter. That is, it led him to the idea of universal gravity, a view\nthat shocked many of his Continental readers in its boldness. This\nhelped to unify what were once called superlunary and sublunary\nphenomena, a unification that was obviously crucial for later research\nin physics. Again, the idea was enabled by Newton's abstract way of\nunderstanding forces—without conceiving of a force as involving\nany specific mechanism or type of physical interaction, Newton thought\nof forces as quantities that are proportional to other features of\nnature. \nDespite his evident success in obtaining what we now call the law of\nuniversal gravitation, Newton admits that he lacks another kind of\nknowledge about gravity; this lack of knowledge directly reflects an\naspect of his abstract characterization of forces. In the General\nScholium, he reminds his readers that gravity is proportional to a\nbody's quantity of matter (its mass) and reaches across vast distances\nwithin our solar system, adding: “I have not as yet been able to\ndeduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity, and\nI do not feign\n hypotheses”.[19]\n With this phrase, one of the most famous\nin all of Newton's writings, he returned to a key theme of his very\nfirst optical paper from forty years earlier, viz. the proper role of\nhypotheses and of hypothetical reasoning within natural\n philosophy.[20]\nSome of Newton's interpreters have regarded this phrase as signaling a\nstrong commitment to the broad doctrine that all hypotheses concerning\nnatural phenomena ought to be avoided in principle. This\ninterpretation is sometimes coupled with the view that some British\nphilosophers in the late seventeenth century regarded Cartesianism as\noverly reliant on hypotheses in reaching conclusions about\nphenomena. But this interpretation may be hard to square with Newton's\ntexts. For instance, in the Scholium to Proposition 96 of Book I of\nthe Principia, Newton discusses hypotheses concerning light\nrays.  Similarly, in query 21 of the Opticks, he proposes\nthat there might be an aether whose differential density accounts for\nthe gravitational force acting between bodies. In light of such\nexamples, one can read the General Scholium's pronouncement in this\nway: a philosopher concerned with explaining some feature of\nnature—such as the fact that gravity is inversely proportional\nto the square of spatial separation, rather than, say, the\ncube—may legitimately entertain and propose hypotheses\nfor consideration, but she may not “feign” the hypothesis\nin the sense of taking it as having been established either through\nexperiment, observation, or some form of reasoning (including\nmathematical reasoning). Hence Newton thinks that he has established\nthe fact that gravity acts on all material bodies in proportion to\ntheir quantity of matter, but he has not established the\nexistence of the aether. By the time of the General Scholium, Newton\nwas increasingly embroiled in philosophical disputes with Leibniz. In\norder to account for the motions of the planetary bodies in his\nTentamen of 1690, Leibniz introduces ex hypothesi\nthe premise that some kind of fluid surrounds, and is contiguous to,\nthe various planetary bodies, and then argues that this fluid must be\nin motion to account for their\n orbits.[21]\n Newton may have argued that Leibniz had\n“feigned” the hypothesis of the vortices. A debate between\nthe two philosophers on this score would bring them to the question of\nthe mechanical philosophy: whereas Newton would object to Leibniz's\nreasoning on methodological grounds, Leibniz would reply that Newton's\ntheory of gravity involves action at a distance, which his vortex\nhypothesis avoids (see below for more details). \nOnce the Principia was published, Newton had a vexed\nrelationship with the mechanical philosophy, an orientation within\nnatural philosophy that is associated strongly with nearly every\nsignificant early modern philosopher, including Descartes, Boyle,\nHuygens, Leibniz, and\n Locke.[22]\n One of the reasons for this complex\nrelationship can be understood if we consider Newton's attitude toward\nforces in an abstract way.  His second law indicates that a body\nmoving rectilinearly will continue to do so unless a force is\nimpressed on it. This is not equivalent to claiming that a body moving\nrectilinearly will continue to do so unless another body impacts upon\nit. A vis impressa—an impressed force—in Newton's\nsystem is not the same as a body, nor even a quality of a body, as we\nhave seen; but what is more, some impressed forces need not involve\ncontact between bodies at all.  For instance, gravity is a kind of\ncentripetal force, and the latter, in turn, is a species of impressed\nforce. Hence a body moving in a straight line will continue to do so\nuntil it experiences a gravitational pull, in which case it will\ndeviate from a straight line motion, even if no body impacts upon\nit. Indeed, the gravitational pull might originate with a mass that is\nmillions of miles away. As we have seen, an impressed force is an\naction exerted on a body. Hence the gravity exerted on a moving body\nis an action (the Latin term is actio), which is obviously a\ncausal notion. This is not an empirical claim per se; it is\nmerely a reflection of Newton's laws, together with his notion of an\nimpressed force, and his further idea that gravity is one kind of\nimpressed force. These elements of the Principia make\nconceptual room for a causal interaction between two bodies separated\nby a vast distance, one enabled by Newton's concept of an impressed\nforce. Aspects of this idea became known in philosophical circles as\nthe problem of action at a distance (Hesse 1961). Many of Newton's\nmost influential contemporaries objected vigorously to the fact that\nhis philosophy had made room for—if not explicitly\ndefended—the possibility of distant action between material\nbodies. Leibniz and Huygens in particular rejected this aspect of\nNewton's work in the strongest terms, and it remained a point of\ncontention between Newton and Leibniz for the rest of their\nlives. Both Leibniz and Huygens were convinced that all natural change\noccurs through contact action, and that any deviation from this basic\nmechanist principle within natural philosophy would lead to serious\ndifficulties, including the revival of outmoded Aristotelian ideas. By\nthe seventh proposition of Book III of the Principia, as we\nhave seen, Newton reached the following conclusion (1999: 810):\n“Gravity acts on all bodies universally and is proportional to\nthe quantity of matter in each”. Leibniz eventually accused\nNewton of regarding gravity as a kind of “occult quality”,\nthat is, as a quality of bodies that is somehow hidden within them and\nbeyond the philosopher's understanding. Newton's gloss on Rule 3 in\nthe Principia, discussed below, only made matters worse from\nLeibniz's point of view, since it tacitly (or functionally) treats\ngravity as a kind of universal quality akin to extension or\nimpenetrability. But unlike them, it was occult, imperceptible and\nunintelligible. \nNewton was well aware that the Principia's methodology of\ndiscovering the forces present in nature was controversial, and not\nmerely because of questions about action at a distance. So when he\nrevised the text, under the editorship of Roger Cotes, for publication\nin a second edition in 1713, he added other methodological\nremarks. These remarks included what Newton called “regulae\nphilosophandi”, or rules of philosophy, which became the\nfocal point of vigorous discussion and debate well into the eighteenth\ncentury. The first two rules concern causal reasoning, but it is the\nthird rule that generated the most debate, for it involved both an\naspect of Newton's controversial argument for universal gravity and\nalso a rare public statement by Newton of what he regarded as the\n“foundation” of natural philosophy. The third rule\nconcerns an induction problem: we have perceptions and experiments\nthat provide us with knowledge of the objects and natural phenomena in\nour neck of the universe, but on what basis can we reach a conclusion\nconcerning objects and phenomena throughout the rest of the\nuniverse? Newton himself reached such a conclusion about gravity in\nproposition seven of Book III of the Principia. Part of\nNewton's answer is presented in rule 3:  Those qualities of bodies that cannot be intended and\nremitted [i.e., increased and diminished] and that belong to all\nbodies on which experiments can be made should be taken as qualities\nof all bodies universally. \nWe know, say, that a clump of dirt has certain qualities such as\nextension and mobility, but how do we know that the entire earth has\nsuch qualities? It surely lies beyond the reach of our experiments, or\nat any rate, it did in Newton's day. Newton says that the sun and the\nearth interact according to his law of gravity, but how do we know\nthat the sun contains a quantity of matter, that it is a material body\nwith the same basic qualities that characterize the earth or the moon?\nIt wasn't at all obvious at the time that the sun is a material body\nat all. Newton thinks that gravity reaches into the very center of the\nsun, but what did anyone in 1713 know about such things? Newton\nglosses his third rule in part as follows, connecting it with his laws\nof motion:  That all bodies are movable and persevere in motion or\nin rest by means of certain forces (which we call forces of inertia)\nwe infer from finding these properties in the bodies that we have\nseen. The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and force of\ninertia[23] of\nthe whole arise from the extension, hardness, impenetrability,\nmobility and force of inertia of each of the parts; and thus we\nconclude that every one of the least parts of all bodies is extended,\nhard, impenetrable, movable, and endowed with a force of inertia. And\nthis is the foundation of all natural philosophy. (Newton 1999:\n795–96) \nMany of Newton's readers in 1713 would have granted him the following\ninference: although we do not have any perceptions of, say, the\ninterior of the earth, or even of many ordinary objects within our\ngrasp, we can reasonably infer that everything with certain basic\nproperties—something akin to what John Locke, borrowing a term\nof Robert Boyle's, called the “primary qualities”—at\nthe macroscopic level is comprised of micro-particles that are\ncharacterized by those same basic properties.  But at the end of his\ngloss of Rule 3, Newton applies this same (or analogous) reasoning to\nthe force of gravity, arguing as follows: since we experience the fact\nthat all bodies on or near the earth gravitate toward the\nearth—in cases such as free fall—and that the moon\ngravitates toward the earth, etc., we can infer that all bodies\neverywhere gravitate toward all other bodies. This argument would\nappear to suggest that gravity—which, as we have seen, is a kind\nof impressed force, an action—is somehow akin to qualities like\nextension and impenetrability. So is Newton suggesting that gravity is\nactually a quality of all bodies? Leibniz and his followers\npounced: if Newton is, at least tacitly, regarding gravity as a\nquality, then he had indeed revived the occult qualities of the\nScholastics, for here we have a quality that is not explicable in\nmechanical terms, and what is worse, one that is not intelligible to\nphilosophers. This question became the subject of intense debate\nthroughout the first half of the eighteenth century (see the last\nsection below). \n\nAlthough the first editions of Newton's Principia and of\nLocke's Essay were published a mere three years apart (in\n1687 and 1690, respectively) their authors worked independently and\ndid not influence the first editions of one another's principal\ntexts. But right around the time of the publication of the first\nedition of the Essay, Newton and Locke became close friends\nand apparently influenced each other's thinking about philosophy,\nreligion, and theology in various ways (they first met in London in\n1689). For his part, Locke called him the “incomparable Mr.\nNewton” on several occasions (e.g., in correspondence: Locke\n1823: vol. 4: 55; and the next long quotation below). Most historians\nthink that each questioned the standard Anglican interpretation of the\nTrinity, contending that Jesus of Nazareth was not a divine figure on\nthe same level as God the creator. Interpreting the Bible through\nhistorical and philosophical analysis in a fashion that was not\nconstrained by standard Anglican doctrine in the late seventeenth\ncentury was fantastically important to Newton, occupying his attention\nfor many years. Given their controversial and politically sensitive\nnature, his so-called anti-Trinitarian views were largely kept secret\namong a small circle of friends. However, Newton trusted Locke enough\nto send him a very long letter—entitled “Two Notable\nCorruptions of Scripture”—to present him with the evidence\nfor Newton's view that the original version of Christianity was\ncorrupted beginning in the 4th century by the introduction\nof the doctrine of the Trinity (Newton 1959–, vol. 3:\n83–129).  Locke was apparently sympathetic with Newton's\napproach. With respect to their public views, Newton and Locke were\noften taken to represent two aspects of the same\nexperimental-philosophical approach toward the close of the\nseventeenth century (Stein 1990; Wilson 1999: 196–214; and\nDomski forthcoming). It is perhaps not difficult to understand why,\nfor Newton was mentioned in one of the most famous passages in all of\nLocke's writings. In the Epistle to the reader of Locke's Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding, we read:  The Commonwealth of Learning, is not at this time without\nMaster-Builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity; but every one\nmust not hope to be a Boyle, or a Sydenham; and in an age that\nproduces such masters, as the great—Huygenius, and the\nincomparable Mr.  Newton, with some other of that strain; 'tis\nambition enough to be employed as an under-labourer in clearing ground\na little, and removing some of the rubbish, that lies in the way to\nknowledge; which certainly had been very much more advanced in the\nworld, if the endeavors of ingenious and industrious men had not been\nmuch cumbred with the learned but frivolous use of uncouth, affected,\nor unintelligible terms, introduced into the sciences, and there made\nan art of, to that degree, that philosophy, which is nothing but the\ntrue knowledge of things, was thought unfit, or uncapable to be\nbrought into well-bred company, and polite conversation. (Locke 1975:\n10) \n\nClearly, Locke seeks in this passage, among other things, to align his\nwork in the Essay with the work of figures such as Newton.\nHere we find, at the opening of Locke's magnum opus, the suggestion\nthat he is content to be an “under-labourer”, a thinker\nwho helps to clear the way for the advance of knowledge. But his list\nof four “master builders”—Boyle, Sydenham, Huygens,\nand Newton—might strike us as an odd pairing: what do these four\nhave in common exactly? It has recently been argued that Locke\nregarded the four as representing the new “experimental\nphilosophy”, and that Locke himself should be interpreted as\nstrongly supporting that orientation within natural philosophy more\ngenerally (Anstey 2011: 220). This would become a popular conception\nof Newton's philosophical approach. \n\nLocke may have regarded Newton as a fellow enthusiast for the\nexperimental philosophy, but there are reasons to think that his\nembrace of the mechanical philosophy presented him with a difficulty\nin interpreting the consequences of Newton's theory of universal\ngravity in the Principia. For Newton's theory seemed to be in\ntension with a mechanist constraint on views of causation, at least\nfrom Locke's own point of view. In the first edition of the\nEssay, Locke articulated a central tenet of mechanist\nthinking about causation when he wrote: “bodies operate by\nimpulse and nothing else” (Essay, II.viii.11). Impulse\nrefers here to contact action. In correspondence with Locke that would\nprove to be influential, Bishop Edward Stillingfleet questioned this\nview from the Essay, contending that Locke must jettison the\nidea of human liberty if he insists that bodies can operate solely by\nimpulse, presumably on the grounds that the human will cannot be\nunderstood to cause bodily action in that manner. In a famous\nexchange, Locke responded in part by reformulating his commitment to\nthe mechanist view that all causation involving material bodies must\nbe by contact (impulse) alone:  It is true, I say, that ‘bodies operate by impulse and\nnothing else’. And so I thought when I writ it, and can yet\nconceive no other way of their operation. But I am since convinced by\nthe judicious Mr. Newton's incomparable book, that it is too bold a\npresumption to limit God's power, in this point, by my narrow\nconceptions.  The gravitation of matter toward matter by ways\ninconceivable to me, is not only a demonstration that God can, if he\npleases, put into bodies, powers and ways of operations, above what\ncan be derived from our idea of body, or can be explained by what we\nknow of matter, but also an unquestionable and every where visible\ninstance, that he has done so.  And therefore in the next edition of\nmy book, I shall take care to have that passage rectified. (Locke\n1823: vol. 4: 467–8). \n\nThis was not merely his privately held view. For instance, near the\nbeginning of his Elements of Natural Philosophy, Locke\nwrites:  Two bodies at a distance will put one another into\nmotion by the force of attraction; which is inexplicable by us, though\nmade evident to us by experience, and so to be taken as a principle in\nnatural philosophy. (Locke 1823: vol. 3: 305) \nIn this way, Locke held the common view that Newton's theory of\nuniversal gravity was incompatible with the mechanical\nphilosophy—and perhaps, unintelligible to us for that very\nreason—and when forced to choose between these two options, he\nevidently sided with Newton, thinking that his theory was supported by\n“experience”. He did so by endorsing the view that God\nmust have added “powers” or “ways of\noperations” to material bodies that cannot be derived from our\nidea of body. Such powers or ways of operations would in this case\nresult in gravitational interactions, presumably amongst bodies that\nare spatially separated from one another by great distances. Yet from\nLocke's point of view, the fact that Newton's theory convinces him\nthat such powers exist does not entail that that theory\nrenders gravity “conceivable”: even if the theory of\nuniversal gravity is correct, it does not allow us to understand how\nmatter—what Locke would call “extended solid\nsubstance”—can interact gravitationally with other matter\nwhen the bits of matter are not in contact with one another (Downing\n1997). So Locke has concluded that bodies can operate on one another\nthrough some means other than impulse, but he retains his firmly held\nbelief that any such operation is not intelligible to us. Locke did\napparently accept the conclusion that spatially separated bodies\ncausally interact with one another in accordance with the law of\nuniversal gravitation, but concluded that the law itself did not\nrender that causal interaction intelligible.  This is precisely the\nkind of reaction to Newton's theory of universal gravity bemoaned by\nLeibniz, who would argue that any operations or powers attributed to\nmaterial bodies must meet the basic criterion of intelligibility\nestablished by the mechanist approach; he might also be inclined to\nargue that any laws regarded as governing the interactions of bodies\nmust also meet that criterion by being derivable in some way from our\nbasic concept of matter (see below). Regardless, this is an excellent\nexample of a case in which Newton's theory in the Principia\nhad a direct impact on the development of philosophical views of\ncausation in the late seventeenth century. \nWhen the great English natural philosopher Robert Boyle died at the\nend of 1691, he endowed a lecture series designed to promote\nChristianity against what Boyle took to be the atheism that had\ninfected English culture after the revolutionary period of the\nmid-century. Famous Newtonians such as Samuel Clarke and William\nWhiston would eventually give the Boyle lectures. The first\n“Boyle lecturer” was the theologian Richard Bentley, who\nwould eventually become the Master of Newton's alma mater,\nTrinity College, Cambridge, and who also worked under Locke's\ncorrespondent, Bishop Stillingfleet, himself an admirer of Newton's\n(Gascoigne 1985: 65). When preparing his lectures for\npublication—they had been presented to a public audience in\nLondon in 1692—Bentley conferred with Newton, hoping to solicit\nhis help in deciphering enough of the Principia to use its\nresults as a bulwark against atheism (Bentley 1976). Newton obliged,\nand a famous correspondence between the two began (eventually\npublished as Bentley 1756). The exchange is of great philosophical\ninterest, for Bentley elicited a number of important clarifications\nthat have no peer within Newton's published oeuvre. \nBentley sought Newton's assistance in particular because he wanted\nguidance in divining how the theory of the Principia\nindicates that the solar system must have been designed by an\nintelligent agent and could not have arisen through the physical\ninteractions of material bodies. In the first edition of the\nPrincipia in 1687, Newton had made such a claim in a very\nbrief statement (Newton 1972: vol. 2: 582–3; Cohen 1971:\n154–6). In the second edition of the text (published in 1713),\nhe removed that statement, replacing it with a more extensive\ndiscussion in the new section of the text, added to its end, called\nthe “General Scholium” (mentioned above). Through their\ncorrespondence, Bentley learned that from Newton's point of view, the\npositions of the planets relative to one another—and especially\nto the sun—indicate that mere chance, or the ordinary physical\ninteractions of the planetary bodies, could not have placed each\nplanet in precisely the right orbit to maintain a solar system like\nours for an extended period of time. With this argument, Newton seems\nto be indicating that mere chance would have produced an unstable\nplanetary system, one in which the planets would eventually either be\ntoo strongly attracted to the sun, falling into it, or be too weakly\nattracted, flying off into space. In this episode, a theologian\nappeals to the new authority of Newtonian natural philosophy when\nattempting to undermine atheism. And that was apparently the very kind\nof interchange that Boyle had envisioned when endowing the lecture\nseries. \nNewton's correspondence with Bentley is justly famous for another\nreason. The criticisms of Newton's theory of gravity by Leibniz and\nHuygens, outlined briefly above, would prove essential to the\nContinental reception of Newtonian natural philosophy more generally\nin the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Since Newton\nheld both of these mathematicians in high regard—he tells\nLeibniz in a 1693 letter that “Huygens is a master, and his\nremarks on my discoveries are brilliant” (Newton 2004:\n108)—one might assume that their criticisms would have pressed\nNewton into articulating an extensive defense of the possibility of\naction at a distance. Newton presented no such defense; moreover,\nthere is actually evidence that Newton himself rejected the\npossibility of action at a distance, despite the fact that the\nPrincipia allows it as a conceptual possibility, if not an\nempirical reality. The evidence lies in Newton's correspondence with\nBentley. In February of 1693, after receiving three letters from\nNewton, Bentley wrote an extensive reply that attempted to\ncharacterize Newton's theory of gravity, and his understanding of the\nnature of matter, in a way that could be used to undermine various\nkinds of atheism. With the three earlier letters as his guide, Bentley\nmakes the following estimation of Newton's understanding of the\npossibility that gravity could somehow be an essential feature of\nmaterial bodies:   (2) And as for Gravitation, tis\nimpossible that That should either be coæternal & essential to\nMatter, or ever acquired by it.  Not essential and coæternal to\nMatter; for then even our System would have been eternal (if gravity\ncould form it) against our Atheist's supposition & what we have\nproved in our Last. For let them assign any given time, that Matter\nconvened from a Chaos into our System, they must affirm that before\nthe given time matter gravitated eternally without convening, which is\nabsurd. {Sir, I make account, that your courteous suggestion by your\nLast, that a Chaos is inconsistent with the Hypothesis of innate\nGravity, is included in this paragraph of Mine.} and again, tis\nunconceivable, that inanimate brute matter should (without a divine\nimpression) operate upon & affect other matter without mutual\ncontact: as it must, if gravitation be essential and inherent in\nit. (Newton 1959–vol. 3: 249) \nIn reply to this letter, Newton refers back to this second\nproposition, making one of the most famous of all his pronouncements\nconcerning the possibility of action at a distance:  The last clause of the second position I like very\nwell. It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without\nthe mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon\nand affect other matter without mutual contact, as it must be, if\ngravitation in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in it.\nAnd this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe innate\ngravity to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential\nto matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance through\na vacuum, without the mediation of anything else, by and through which\ntheir action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me\nso great an absurdity that I believe no man who has in philosophical\nmatters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity\nmust be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain\nlaws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left\nopen to the consideration of my readers. (Newton 2004:\n102–3)[24] \nIt certainly seems that Newton was uncomfortable with the very idea of\naction at a distance. But of course, things are not always as they\nseem in interpretations of difficult philosophical texts: some\nhistorians and philosophers have argued strongly that there are other\nreadings of the\n letter.[25]\n Rather than rejecting distant action\nbetween material bodies per se, they argue, Newton may have\nbeen rejecting a particular version of that idea, one associated with\nthe “Epicurean” idea that gravity is somehow an essential\nfeature of all material bodies, a stronger view than Newton might wish\nto endorse. The idea might be roughly as follows: Newton wanted to\nleave open the possibility that God had endowed bodies with a power to\nact at a distance on one another, a position that is at least\nreminiscent of Locke's view in his correspondence with Stillingfleet\n(see above). The reason is that Newton held the standard view at the\ntime that matter itself is passive, requiring some kind of divine\nintervention in order to interact causally with other matter. Again,\none finds a Lockean echo of this idea (which may be no accident):\nLocke sometimes suggests that matter itself is passive in the sense\nthat it cannot move itself; instead, motion must be\n“superadded” to it by God. If the world consisted solely\nof a bunch of material objects, say rocks floating in interstellar\nspace, then they would not experience any changes in their states of\nmotion unless some external force acted upon them—if left to its\nown devices, matter is passive and does not move. To argue, as some\n“Epicurean” philosophers may have done, that matter itself\nessentially contains gravity as a feature, is to deny that matter is\npassive; it is to suggest that the rocks in interstellar space would\nattract one another and begin to move “on their own”,\nwithout any external force influencing them. And this, in turn, might\nlead us on a slippery slope to atheism, for on this view, matter would\nact on its own, without any divine intervention. Or so Bentley and\nNewton might be interpreted. \nClearly, one reasonable motive for uncovering a nuanced interpretation\nof Newton's letter to Bentley is the obvious fact that Newton\napparently regarded action at a distance as perfectly possible when\nwriting the Principia. Indeed, it is difficult to reconcile\nthe Principia with the Bentley correspondence.  One can argue\nthat although he left open the possibility of action at a distance in\nhis main work, Newton himself did not accept that possibility because\nof his more general commitments (Janiak 2008 and forthcoming). The\ndebate on such matters continues unabated. However, regardless of\nNewton's personal attitude toward distant action among material\nbodies, his mechanist interlocutors and readers continued to object to\nthe physical theory outlined in Book III of the Principia on\nthe grounds that, at the very least, it left open the conceptual\npossibility of a kind of action that cannot in fact exist anywhere in\nnature. That remained one of Leibniz's principal objections against\nNewtonian natural philosophy throughout the last twenty years of his\nlife, animating his correspondence with numerous figures, including\nmost prominently the Newtonian theologian and philosopher Samuel\nClarke. \n\nIn many ways, Leibniz and Newton grew up in the same philosophical\nenvironment: each came of age during the heyday of Cartesianism, and\neach argued in particular that Cartesian views in natural philosophy\nfailed to include a sufficiently robust conception of the forces of\nbodies in nature. Force would lie at the center of Newton's mature\nphysics (Westfall 1971), and would become even more central to\nLeibniz's thinking, playing an essential role in his metaphysics as\nwell (Garber 2012). The two knew one another as mathematicians already\nin the 1670s, and as we have seen, Leibniz discussed Newton's first\noptical work with Huygens; but after the publication of the\nPrincipia in 1687, their philosophical relationship, which\nwas marked originally by respectful disagreement, began to develop in\nearnest. Just two years after the Principia appeared, Leibniz\npublished his Essay on the Causes of Celestial Motions (or\nTentamen), and then in 1693, the two corresponded with one\nanother on both mathematical and philosophical issues (Newton 2004:\n106–9). Leibniz initiated their discussion in March of 1693:\nafter highlighting Newton's “astonishing discovery” that\nthe elliptical planetary orbits found by Kepler can be the result of\ngravitational attraction within the solar system, Leibniz contends\nthat these motions must be caused by “the motion of a fluid\nmedium” (Newton 2004: 106). He had described such a fluid\nmedium, or vortex, in detail in his own Essay. The background\nto Leibniz's comment is his unwavering commitment—one shared by\nHuygens, whose theory of gravity's cause Leibniz mentions in the same\nletter—to the mechanical philosophy's requirement that all\nchanges in motion must be the result of bits of matter impacting on\none another. Thus for Leibniz, one can (e.g.) think of the sun as\nattracting the earth, but in fact the cause of the earth's\nacceleration, of its true motion around the sun, is its interaction\nwith a fluid medium (Descartes was also a famous proponent of a vortex\ntheory of planetary motion—Aiton 1972: 30–64; Gaukroger\n2002: 150–3). When he replied in October of 1693, however,\nNewton did not accept Leibniz's philosophical olive\nbranch—Leibniz had insisted that the vortex theory of planetary\nmotion “would not at all detract from the value and truth of\nyour discovery” that Kepler's ellipses result simply from the\nconception of attraction or gravitation (Newton 2004: 107)—on\nthe grounds that vortices would disturb the motions of planets and\ncomets through the solar system. Newton writes that some “very\nfine” matter fills the heavens, adding:  For\nsince celestial motions are more regular than if they arose from\nvortices and observe other laws, so much so that vortices contribute\nnot to the regulation but the disturbance of the motions of planets\nand comets; and since all phenomena of the heavens and of the sea\nfollow precisely, so far as I am aware, from nothing but gravity acting\nin accordance with the laws described by me; and since nature is very\nsimple, I have myself concluded that all other causes are to be\nrejected and that the heavens are to be stripped as far as may be of\nall matter, lest the motions of planets and comets be hindered or\nrendered irregular. But if, meanwhile, someone explains gravity along\nwith all its laws by the action of some subtle matter, and shows that\nthe motion of planets and comets will not be disturbed by this matter,\nI shall be far from objecting. (Newton 2004:\n108–9) \n\nThis is obviously a passage rich with significant meaning. Leibniz\nclearly insisted that vortices, or some physical object or fluid, must\nbe in contact with the planetary orbits if we are to explain why they\ndeviate from the tangents along the orbital paths when circling the\nsun. Newton's reply is that giant swirling fluids in the heavens would\nactually disturb the regular orbital paths, and the paths of comets\nthrough the solar system. That reply might be thought of as empirical\nin character, for it depends on observational data regarding the\nactual paths of the heavenly bodies. But Leibinz's perspective is\nobviously not merely empirical in character: he does not postulate\nvortices (or anything akin to them) on observational grounds; he\ninfers their existence because he thinks we know (perhaps we can add,\nwe know a priori) that physical bodies such as comets or\nplanets can deviate from a rectilinear path—they can\naccelerate—only if some other physical item impacts upon them.\nNewton has a reply to that kind of view as well: he insists that the\nphenomena of the motion of the heavenly bodies “follows”\nsolely from gravity itself—an impressed force, as we have seen,\nand therefore an “action”—in accordance with the\nlaws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Since gravity is\nan action—clearly, a causal notion—it seems clear that\nNewton's answer to Leibniz's idea that vortices cause the planetary\norbits is that gravity itself causes them, and nothing else.  And it\nis not much of a leap to conclude, in turn, that this reply commits\nNewton to the idea that bodies involved in gravitational interactions,\nsuch as the sun and the earth, act at a distance on one another\nthrough the force of gravity. It is not hard to divine why Leibniz\n(and Huygens) would have concluded that Newton had relinquished any\ncommitment to the norms of the mechanical philosophy. \nDespite Leibniz's (and Huygens's) criticisms of his theory of gravity\nin particular, and his methods in natural philosophy in general,\nNewton stuck to his guns. Nearly twenty years after their illuminating\nexchange in 1693, Leibniz and Newton narrowly missed a second\nopportunity to discuss their philosophical differences directly.  In\nMay of 1712, Leibniz published a letter to Nicholas Hartsoeker that\nwas highly critical of the Newtonians; it was published in English\ntranslation in the Memoirs of Literature, a journal to which\nRoger Cotes, the editor of the Principia's second edition,\nheld a subscription (Newton 2004: 109). After Cotes brought Leibniz's\ncriticisms to Newton's attention—especially the claim that the\nPrincipia renders gravitation a “perpetual\nmiracle” because it does not specify the physical mechanism\nunderlying it—Newton wrote an intriguing, but only posthumously\npublished, rebuttal. Here is part of Newton's paraphrase of Leibniz's\noriginal letter:  But he [i.e., Leibniz] goes on and tells us that God\ncould not create planets that should move round of themselves without\nany cause that should prevent their removing through the tangent. For\na miracle at least must keep the planet in. (Newton 2004: 117)\n \nNewton's response to this Leibnizian charge is illuminating:\n  But certainly God could create planets that should\nmove round of themselves without any other cause than gravity that\nshould prevent their removing through the tangent. For gravity without\na miracle may keep the planets in. (ibid.) \nThus Newton repeats the view he mentions to Leibniz in 1693, viz.,\nthat the force of gravity itself causes the planets to follow their\norbital paths rather than their inertial trajectories along the\ntangents to those orbits, independently of any fluid medium in the\nheavens. But in this posthumously published letter, Newton did not\nmerely repeat his basic understanding of gravity from his 1693\nexchange with Leibniz; he also included a wider discussion of\nmechanist norms within philosophy more generally. Again, Newton begins\nby quoting Leibniz:  But Mr. Leibniz goes\non. “The ancients and the moderns, who own that gravity is an\noccult quality, are in the right, if they mean by it that there is a\ncertain mechanism unknown to them whereby all bodies tend towards the\ncenter of the earth. But if they mean that the thing is performed\nwithout any mechanism by a simple primitive quality or by a law of God\nwho produces that effect without using any intelligible means, it is\nan unreasonable and occult quality, and so very occult that it is\nimpossible that it should ever be done though an angel or God himself\nshould undertake to explain it”. (Newton 2004: 116)  In this passage, Leibniz returns to the kind of criticism that he\nwould present against the “superaddition” view that Locke\npresented to Stillingfleet, arguing that philosophers must reject the\nidea that gravity could simply be a feature of bodies that God adds to\nthem, despite the fact that we cannot possibly understand\ngravitational interactions based on our idea of body (our idea of\nextended solid substances, or another similar idea). Indeed, Leibniz\nraises the stakes by contending that God himself could not explicate\nhow such interactions are possible based on the idea of\nmatter. Leibniz would argue, perhaps on metaphysical grounds, that any\nlaws said to govern the interaction of bodies, and any qualities\nattributed to bodies, must be intelligible in the terms available to\nphilosophers through the mechanist orientation. In particular, laws\nand qualities must be intelligible in terms of the shape, size, motion\nand impenetrability (or solidity) of bodies. In this way, one might\nconclude that Locke and Leibniz actually do not necessarily disagree\non whether gravity can be made intelligible in mechanist terms; they\nsimply disagree on the propriety of the contention that God could\n“superadd” a feature to bodies that cannot be made\nintelligible in that way. \nNewton's reply to Leibniz's argument is illuminating.  Instead of\npresenting a narrow defense of his view, perhaps by denying that he\nhas postulated any non-mechanical causation with his theory of\ngravity, he challenges the mechanical philosophy itself by contending\nthat it should not be understood as holding for all natural\nphenomena: \nThe same ought to be said of hardness. So then gravity and hardness\nmust go for unreasonable occult qualities unless they can be explained\nmechanically. And why may not the same be said of the\nvis inertiae [force of inertia] and the extension, the\nduration and mobility of bodies, and yet no man ever attempted to\nexplain these qualities mechanically, or took them for miracles or\nsupernatural things or fictions or occult qualities. They are the\nnatural, real, reasonable, manifest qualities of all bodies seated in\nthem by the will of God from the beginning of the creation and\nperfectly incapable of being explained mechanically, and so may be the\nhardness of primitive particles of bodies. And therefore if any man\nshould say that bodies attract one another by a power whose cause is\nunknown to us, or by a power seated in the frame of nature by the will\nof God, or by a power seated in a substance in which bodies move and\nfloat without resistance and which has therefore no\nvis inertiae but acts by other laws than those that are\nmechanical: I know not why he should be said to introduce miracles and\noccult qualities and fictions into the world. For Mr. Leibniz himself\nwill scarce say that thinking is mechanical as it must be if to\nexplain it otherwise be to make a miracle, an occult quality, and a\nfiction. (Newton 2004: 116) \nThe first aspect of Newton's argument, it seems, is to indicate that\nmechanical explanations are predicated on referencing certain kinds of\nqualities when investigating natural phenomena, and that these\nqualities themselves are therefore not subject to mechanical\nexplanation. For instance, since mechanist explanations—say, of\nthe way in which magnets attract iron filings across a\ntable—must refer to qualities such as the extension of the\nbodies subject to the explanations, then we cannot give a mechanist\nexplanation of extension itself. Of course, Leibniz might reply that\nwe need not provide any explanation of the basic qualities of bodies\nthat figure in mechanical explanations, for those properties have been\nchosen by the “moderns” precisely because they are\nperfectly intelligible on their own, perhaps unlike various qualities\nattributed to “Scholastic” accounts of natural\nphenomena. The second aspect of Newton's argument is more\nintriguing—it also harks back to Locke's discussion with\nStillingfleet, for Locke had contended that God may have superadded\nnot only gravity to material bodies, but also the power of thought,\nlinking them because he believed that neither could be rendered\nintelligible using any philosophical means at his disposal. That is,\nfrom Locke's point of view, we know that human beings—which are,\nor at least contain, material bodies with size, shape, motion and\nsolidity, along with parts characterized by those qualities—are\ncapable of thought, but since we cannot discern how any material thing\ncould possibly have that capacity, we conclude that God may have\nsuperadded that feature to us, or to our bodies. Thought and gravity\nare dis-analogous in the sense that we did not require anything like\nNewton's theory to convince us that human beings can think, but they\nare otherwise analogous.  Newton then attempts to make the following\nargument: since Leibniz would have to agree that thinking is not a\nmechanical process, and not mechanically explicable, he must agree\nthat there is at least one aspect of the world that has the following\ntwo features, (1) it is not mechanical; and, (2) it is clearly not to\nbe rejected on that ground alone. He attempts to liken\ngravity (as he understands it) to thinking (as he\nbelieves Leibniz is required to understand it), arguing that despite\nthe fact that it is not mechanical—it cannot be explained\nmechanically—it should not be rejected on that ground. This\nargument may be predicated on the view that human beings, material\nthings, or at least partially material things, do the thinking, rather\nthan immaterial things, such as minds or souls, for if one attributes\nall thought to an immaterial mind or soul, then there is no pressure\nto say that anything in nature, or perhaps even any aspect of anything\nin nature, has a feature that cannot be mechanically explicated. If\none accepts Locke's view (apparently also endorsed by Newton) that we\nshould attribute thinking to material things, or to aspects of\nmaterial things, then perhaps Newton has successfully followed Locke\nin likening gravity to thought, thereby making room for aspects of\nnature that are not mechanical after all. This vexing issue would\ncontinue to generate debates amongst Newton's and Leibniz's various\nfollowers in England, and on the Continent, respectively. \nLeibniz's most extensive debate with the Newtonians would not occur\nuntil the very end of his life. His celebrated correspondence with\nSamuel Clarke, Newton's friend and supporter in London in the early\npart of the eighteenth century, is his most famous interaction with\nthe Newtonians, occurring right before his death in 1716 (Clarke and\nLeibniz 1717). Leibniz fomented the correspondence in November of 1715\nby sending a short, provocative letter to Princess Caroline of Wales,\none designed to provoke a response from Newton's circle in\nLondon. Leibniz knew well that Princess Caroline was a leading\nintellectual and political figure in England at the time, one who\nwould surely wish to see the views of her countrymen defended against\nLeibniz's rather shocking claims about the religious consequences of\nNewtonian thinking. He opens his initial letter by mentioning both\nLocke and Newton, along with the issues about materiality and thinking\nthat arose in his near exchange with Newton in 1712:  Natural religion itself seems to decay [in England]\nvery much. Many will have human souls to be material; others make God\nhimself a corporeal being. Mr. Locke and his followers are uncertain\nat least whether the soul is not material and naturally\nperishable. Sir Isaac Newton says that space is an organ which God\nmakes use of to perceive things by. But if God stands in need of any\norgan to perceive things by, it will follow that they do not depend\naltogether on him, nor were produced by him. (Clarke and Leibniz 1717:\nL 1: 1–3)   Thus Leibniz charges both Lockeans and Newtonians with presenting\nphilosophical views of the human and of the divine that lead to\ntheologically unsavory consequences, such as the idea that the human\nsoul might be material, and the view that God must employ something\nakin to an organ in order to perceive happenings in the world. These\nwere fighting words. Although Locke had died in 1704, he had various\nfollowers in England at the time (Gascoigne 1985: 172–3), and\nNewton himself was at the height of his influence: he had recently\nbeen knighted, as Leibniz acknowledges by calling him\n“Sir” in his letter, and was at that time President of the\nRoyal Society.  Moreover, Samuel Clarke had given the Boyle lectures\nin 1704 and again in 1705, so he was a public figure associated with\nthe state of Christianity in England. Once Clarke took the bait,\nreplying that same month to Leibniz's charges, Locke's views quickly\ndropped from view and the two focused specifically on Leibniz's\nnumerous objections to Newtonian ideas and methods. But why did Clarke\nrespond on Newton's behalf, and what was Newton's actual role in the\ncorrespondence? These questions continue to puzzle scholars (see Cohen\nand Koyré 1962; Bertoloni Meli 1999 and 2002; Vailati 1997). There is\nno documentary evidence, such as letters, between Clarke and Newton\nindicating the contours of his role; then again, at this time, both\nmen lived in London and Clarke was Newton's parish priest, so the lack\nof letters or other papers is perhaps unsurprising. That fact alone is\nintriguing, for the theological differences between the two are\nsalient: since Newton was a committed anti-Trinitarian—a fact\nknown to figures like Locke and to others such as William\nWhiston—he may have decided that Leibniz's contentions about\n“natural religion” in England would best be answered by\nwhat we might now call a more mainstream theological figure like\nClarke. In any event, there is no doubt that Clarke was taken by\nLeibniz and his followers to be speaking for Newton and his\ncircle. Nonetheless, there are certainly aspects of Clarke's views\nthat may deviate from Newton's own opinions, so it would be unwise to\n(as it were) remove Clarke from our conception of the correspondence\nby regarding it as effectively Newton's work.  Leibniz's correspondence with Clarke is methodologically\ncharacteristic: he leaves much of his own systematic and complex\nmetaphysical theorizing—including the monadology—in the\nbackground, bringing to the fore only those elements that are both\nnecessary for his criticisms of the Newtonians and also likely to\ngarner support from Clarke. Thus the key to many of Leibniz's\ncriticisms is the principle of sufficient reason (PSR), which he knows\nClarke will endorse (although with a distinct conception of its scope:\nLeibniz asserts, while Clarke denies, that the principle demands that\neach act of divine willing requires a reason; for Clarke, divine\nwilling itself is reason enough for some physical state of affairs to\nobtain, or event to occur). Leibniz argues in particular that several\nkey aspects of the Newtonian worldview are simply incompatible with\nthe PSR, including the idea of absolute space. If space were in fact\ncompletely independent of all physical objects and all relations among\nthem, as the Newtonians seem to assert, then a problem arises:  I have many demonstrations to confute the fancy of\nthose who take space to be a substance or at least an absolute\nbeing. But I shall only use, at present, one demonstration, which the\nauthor here gives me occasion to insist upon. I say, then, that if\nspace were an absolute being, something would happen for which it\nwould be impossible that there should be a sufficient\nreason—which is against my axiom.  And I prove it thus: space is\nsomething absolutely uniform, and without the things placed in it, one\npoint of space absolutely does not differ in any respect whatsoever\nfrom another point of space. Now from this it follows (supposing space\nto be something in itself, besides the order of bodies among\nthemselves) that it is impossible there should be a reason why God,\npreserving the same situations of bodies among themselves, should have\nplaced them in space after one certain particular manner and not\notherwise—why everything was not placed the quite contrary way,\nfor instance, by changing east into west. But if space is nothing else\nbut this order or relation, and is nothing at all without bodies but\nthe possibility of placing them, then those two states, the one such\nas it is now, the other supposed to be the quite contrary way, would\nnot at all differ from one another. Their difference therefore is only\nto be found in our chimerical supposition of the reality of\nspace. (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 3: 5) \nLeibniz's argument is clever at the outset: he bypasses the thorny\nproblem of determining whether Newton's idea of absolute space commits\nhim to thinking of space as a substance—a view, incidentally,\nwhich Newton explicitly considers and rejects in De\nGravitatione (Newton 2004: 21–2)—by presupposing only\nthat Newton thinks of space as existing independently of objects and\ntheir relations. If space is indeed independent in this way, then it\nwould seem that God faces a choice: when creating the world, or\nmatter, why place (e.g.) the earth in one particular part of space\nrather than any other? The parts of space, independently of all\nobjects and all relations, obviously do not differ from one another in\nany salient respect at all, so it would seem that one could not even\ntheoretically devise a reason for placing the earth anywhere in\nparticular, as opposed to anywhere else in particular. (This argument,\nincidentally, does not depend on our having the capacity to refer to\nplaces within empty space at all.) But since space exists, with all\nits places, independently of the earth and everything else, then God\nmust indeed have some reason to place the earth in one place rather\nthan another—for Leibniz, even the divine will is inert\nindependent of any reason for (as it were) moving in one direction\nrather than another. Finally, Leibniz argues that he himself avoids\nthis problem by asserting that space is nothing above and beyond the\nobjects in the world and all possible relations amongst them (hence he\nholds a kind of modal relationalist view, in more modern\nterminology). God faces no problematic choice on this view, since\nspace does not exist prior to the creation of the world, or of\nmaterial objects: to create objects with spatial relations just is\nipso facto to create space itself, for it is nothing over and\nabove objects and their relations.  If you like, space for Leibniz\njust is a way of conceptually grasping all objects and all possible\nrelations amongst them, all at once. Time, similarly, is a way of\ngrasping the whole series of events that have characterized\nhistory. Clarke's reply is somewhat disappointing: he blocks Leibniz's\ninference by simply denying that the divine will must have a reason to\nplace (say) the earth in one place rather than another (Clarke and\nLeibniz 1717: C 3: 5). The PSR is not violated in this case, according\nto Clarke's interpretation of it, because it requires only this: if\nthe earth appears in one place rather than another, there must be a\nreason that it appears there, and the reason in this case is simply\nthe divine will; there is no further question about why the divine\nbeing made a particular choice rather than another. In the quotation\nabove, Leibniz speaks of the Newtonians as endorsing “the\nreality of space”, which Leibniz regards as\n“chimerical”. This remark highlights another important\naspect of Leibniz's conception of space and time, one that is often\nignored in contemporary discussions, which tend to emphasize\nLeibnizian “relationalism” in opposition to Newtonian\n“absolutism”. Leibniz's view of space and time connects\nintimately with broader aspects of his metaphysical positions: unlike\nordinary physical objects, which are constituted by their parts (they\nare discrete), and which exhibit features that involve internal\ndistinctions amongst those parts, he thinks of space and time as\ncontinuous and homogeneous. Leaving aside the monadology, as he does\nin his correspondence with Clarke, this means that for Leibniz, it is\nphysical objects that are real things; space and time are merely\n“ideal” or abstract entities whose continuity and\nhomogeneity signal this special status. It is not merely that space\nand time are nothing over and above the events and relations of\nobjects that exist in our world; it is also the case that they are\nideal: they depend in some way on the human mind for their\nexistence. Or so Leibniz seems to suggest. This aspect of his view\nwould become of central importance to Kant's understanding of the\nLeibniz-Newton debate on the nature of space. \nObviously, Leibniz's arguments against the Newtonians highlighted a\nfundamental difference between his interpretation of the PSR and\nClarke's: where Leibniz held what we might call the\n“rationalist” view that all willing, all choice, must\noccur for a reason—a requirement from which even the divine\nbeing is not exempt—Clarke held what we might call the\n“voluntarist” view that willing, or choice, itself need\nnot occur for any reason, for it is itself a sufficient reason for\nsome states of affairs to obtain or event to occur. From Leibniz's\npoint of view, this renders the will, including the divine will,\nopaque or unintelligible: if an agent can act or make a choice without\nhaving any reason for it, then surely the agent is not rational, and\nif the PSR demands anything of the world, it is that the world be\nrationally intelligible to us. This requirement must hold of agents\nand their wills as well. But from Clarke's point of view, this\nrequirement is too stringent, especially in the divine case: if we\nhold that even God must have a reason for choosing to create one state\nof affairs rather than another—for choosing, say, to part the\nRed Sea rather than the Mississippi River—then we are ipso\nfacto restricting God's freedom. Surely God has the freedom to\nchoose to do anything at all, or at least, anything that does not\ncontain or instantiate a contradiction, and for his part, Leibniz\nagrees that the principle of contradiction does not entail the\nPSR—the latter is a separate and independent principle which is\nnecessary for metaphysics and natural philosophy to extend beyond\nmathematics, which requires only the principle of contradiction\n(Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 2: 1).  God doesn't need a reason to part\nthe sea—God can simply do it! Leibniz replies: Clarke's view\nleaves us with a God, and indeed with ordinary agents, who can act\narbitrarily, with no reason at all, and that is not the kind of\nfreedom that philosophy seeks; it wishes to see agents as engaged in\nrational action. In their differing interpretations of the PSR, and\ntheir correspondingly distinct conceptions of freedom and reason, the\ndebate between Leibniz and Clarke hits rock bottom.  Leibniz's criticisms of the Newtonians were not restricted to\nquestions about the nature of space and time; he also revived his old\ncomplaint—one shared with, and by, Huygens, as we have seen\nabove—that Newton's physical theory commits him to the\npossibility, if not to the reality, of action at a distance among the\nplanetary bodies. In one passage in his fourth letter, for instance,\nLeibniz writes (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: L 4: 45):  It is also a supernatural thing that bodies should\nattract one another at a distance without any intermediate means and\nthat a body should move around without receding in the tangent, though\nnothing hinders it from so receding. For these effects cannot be\nexplained by the nature of things. \nAs a defender of the mechanical philosophy, Leibniz insists here, as\nhe had before, that a material body like the Earth would recede along\nthe tangent to its orbit if it were not the case that it was impacted\nupon by some physical body or bodies, such as a vortex or another kind\nof fluid filling the solar system.  Clarke's reply to this charge is\nespecially illuminating (Clarke and Leibniz 1717: C 4: 45):  That one body should attract another without any\nintermediate means, is indeed not a miracle, but a contradiction: for\n‘tis supposing something to act where it is not. But the means\nby which two bodies attract each other may be invisible and\nintangible, and of a different nature from mechanism, and yet, acting\nregularly and constantly, may well be called natural, being much less\nwonderful than animal motion, which yet is never called a\nmiracle’. \nThis passage is bound to confuse readers. On the one hand, Clarke is\nclearly arguing that the Newtonians refuse to restrict their\nunderstanding of causal interactions in nature to mechanical cases; on\nthe other, however, he does not accept what many at that time would\nhave regarded as the obvious implication of this denial of mechanism,\nnamely that action at a distance is perfectly possible (a move\nembraced by some later in the eighteenth century, such as\nKant). Instead, Clarke not only rejects action at a distance as Newton\npossibly had before him; he contends that it isn't even logically\npossible! In his various pronouncements to Bentley and others, Newton\nnever contended that action at a distance was simply a contradiction\nand therefore impossible, presumably even for the divine being, who is\ntypically said to be capable of creating any situation that does not\ninstantiate a contradiction (although Descartes's views on the eternal\ntruths are obviously more complicated).  Clarke's view raises a\nserious problem for Newtonians: if action at a distance is simply a\ncontradiction, and therefore not a possible physical situation, even\nwith divine intervention, then how ought one to interpret the theory\nof universal gravity, which certainly appears to indicate\nthat distant action is perfectly possible, and perhaps even actual? If\nwe interpret the theory as postulating actual distant action, say\nbetween the moon and the earth, then it clearly must be mistaken; but\neven if we interpret it less strongly, as merely postulating that\ndistant action between the moon and the earth is possible, that would\npresumably disqualify the theory as well.  Perhaps one can save\nClarke's view by contending that since distant action is logically\nimpossible, Newton's theory must therefore be interpreted as neutral\non that issue. This is one issue where Clarke's views may differ\nsubstantially from Newton's own. Regardless of whether Clarke\nrepresented Newton's own views faithfully, there is no doubt that his\ncorrespondence with Leibniz helped to shape the agenda of philosophy\nin the eighteenth century. The history of eighteenth-century philosophy cannot be written\nwithout extensive discussion of Newton's own views and of his\ninfluence on the views of other figures both in England and on the\nContinent. As we have seen, when Newton was a young student at Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, Cartesian views in natural philosophy and much\nelse besides had replaced the ideas and methods of Aristotle and his\nfollowers as the most important subject for discussion amongst\nphilosophers. In many ways, Newton eventually succeeded in convincing\nphilosophers that his own ideas and methods were superior to those of\nthe Cartesians—especially when it came to thinking about motion\nand its causes within nature—but this historical fact did not\nmean that Newtonianism, even broadly construed, became the dominant\ntrend in natural philosophy during Newton's lifetime. On the contrary,\nNewton's views continued to be the subject of intense scrutiny and\ndebate, especially amongst Leibniz and his followers (such as\nChristiaan Wolff) and fellow mechanists (such as Huygens). Indeed, a\nlate-seventeenth-century debate between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas\nwas supplanted by an early eighteenth century debate between\nLeibnizian and Newtonian views; the latter debate would continue in\none form or another for the rest of the century: it was a driving\nforce during the French Enlightenment, and remained a powerful\nstimulant to philosophical theorizing in the 1770s and 1780s, when\nKant forged his magisterial “critical” system of\nphilosophy, an approach that almost single-handedly set the\nphilosophical agenda of the early nineteenth century. Hence Newton's\ninfluence on the eighteenth century did not take the form of a single\nphilosophical program or movement; instead, it was the controversial\nnature of his ideas and methodology that drove much of the\nphilosophical discussion. There are some irreducibly nationalist elements in the way that\nphilosophy developed over the course of the eighteenth century, so it\nmay be reasonable to chart Newton's impact country by country.\nNewton's ideas and methods were certainly most influential in England,\nwhere there grew to be a strong “Newtonian”\nmovement—also called the “experimental philosophy”\nprogram—by roughly 1700. By the fin de siecle, it is\nprobably safe to say that natural philosophy had become heavily\nNewtonian in England, at least in the sense that it had eclipsed both\nCartesianism (Henry 2013: 124 and introduction to Voltaire 1738/1992:\n7), and other local movements, such as Cambridge Platonism, which had\nexhibited a strong influence during the previous generation. One might\nput the point somewhat differently: to the extent that there was a\ndominant strand in England by 1700, it was the “experimental\nphilosophy”, a view that was associated strongly with figures\nsuch as Boyle, Newton and Locke. Figures such as Hobbes had opposed\nthis approach to solving philosophical problems, but had failed to\ngain nearly as much influence. Perhaps more importantly, Newton's view\nof motion, his understanding of space and time, and his approach to\nachieving knowledge of natural phenomena, helped to shape the agenda\nof British philosophy for the next fifty years. In addition to\nNewton's influence on Locke's thinking about matter and causation,\nexplored above, both Berkeley and Hume expended considerable energy\ngrappling with the wider consequences and implications of the\nNewtonian version of the experimental philosophy. For his part,\nBerkeley famously derided many Newtonians methods and\nideas—sometimes exempting Newton himself from his conception of\nthe worst philosophical excesses of his followers—including the\nrise of the calculus among mathematicians (in The Analyst)\nand the use of the idea of a force as the basic causal concept in\nnatural philosophy (in De Motu—both reprinted in\nBerkeley 1992).  Berkeley's theory of ideas, which arose in part from\nhis reflections of what we would now call Locke's\n“empiricist” notion of representation, suggested to him\nthat no idea can be abstract: each idea must represent a\nparticular rather than a universal. Hence we can have an idea\nof a particular car, but not of a car in general (not of, as it were,\nthe form of a car); we can have an idea of a particular shade of\nyellow, perhaps because we've just seen a lovely yellow rose at the\nflorist, but not of yellow in general; and so on. Berkeley then argued\nthat modern mathematics, especially the calculus, and modern natural\nphilosophy, especially Newtonian versions of it, were often reliant on\nabstract ideas, and therefore philosophically suspect. For instance,\nhe contended that the very idea of absolute motion was suspect because\nwe can represent to ourselves only various motions with particular\nfeatures related to particular bodies in motion, but\n“absolute” motion cannot be rendered particular\nin anything like this way; it remains abstract (Downing 2005:\n235). Thus although Newtonian views were considered to be essential to\nthe rise of experimental philosophy in Britain, Berkeley derided them\nas insufficiently experimental, as overly reliant on representations\nof universals and of universal quantities, rather than on the\nrepresentation of particulars. In a reflection of Malebranche's\ninfluence, Berkeley also argued that some Newtonians wrongly\nattributed genuine causal powers to ordinary material objects through\ntheir use of the concept of impressed force; wrongly, because Berkeley\nfirmly rejected the notion that any body could exert any causal\npower. All causation in Berkeley's system is due either to the\nintervention of the divine in the course of history, or to spirits or\nminds, which are genuinely causally active. Finally, in an argument\nthat would prefigure Mach's reactions to Newtonian conceptions of\nspace, time and motion in the late nineteenth century—which were\nexpressive of a broad commitment to\n“empiricism”—Berkeley contended that absolute space\nis a metaphysical aberration: philosophers should not posit any entity\nor thing that is beyond all possible perception. In sum, Berkeley was\nhighly critical of many aspects of the Newtonian program, but for that\nvery reason, it was Newton's ideas that helped to shape many of his\nphilosophical projects. For his part, Hume had a more nuanced reaction to the emergence of\nthe Newtonian program (cf. Schliesser 2007 and DePierris 2012). He\ncertainly signaled his endorsement of the experimental\nphilosophy—itself strongly associated with the Newtonians, along\nwith figures like Boyle and Hooke, as we have seen—when he gave\nhis Treatise the following subtitle: “being an attempt\nto introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral\nsubjects”. And one might argue that Hume made a kind of Lockean\nmove when he chose to endorse the Newtonian program specifically in\npreference to the mechanical philosophy, which he regarded with\nsuspicion. A famous comment from his History of England\nbolsters this interpretation:  While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of\nthe mysteries of nature, he showed at the same time the imperfections\nof the mechanical philosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate\nsecrets to that obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will\nremain. (Hume 1854 [1754–61]: vol. 5: 374) \nThe difference between Locke and Hume might be that the former, unlike\nthe latter, nonetheless insisted that mechanism continued to provide\nphilosophers with a canon for the intelligibility of causation within\nnature (Hume's critique of earlier conceptions of causation, including\nLocke's, is certainly well known). Hume also expended considerable\neffort in interpreting some of the philosophical aspects or\nconsequences of Newton's theory of gravity and his corresponding\nunderstanding of the nature of matter. In particular, he wished to\nprovide what we would now call an empiricist interpretation of\nNewton's three laws of motion, his concept of mass (quantity of\nmatter), and his understanding of gravity; in the process, he does not\nshy away from interpreting Newton's sometimes confusing notion of the\nvis inertiae or force of inertia, which as we have seen\nabove, is not a kind of impressed force. This was particularly\ndifficult because Hume had already contended that strictly speaking,\nwe have no idea (no representation) of force or power—these are\nmerely words employed by natural philosophers without any ideas\ncorresponding to them. Thus he must find an interpretation of Newton\nthat is not predicated on our ability to form an idea of forces or\npowers. In a famous footnote in his Enquiry Concerning Human\nUnderstanding, he writes (Hume 1777/1993: §vii.i note 2,\n48–49): I need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so\nmuch talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter.\nWe find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for\never in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and\nthat a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as\nit acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis\ninertiae, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have\nany idea of the inert power; in the same manner as, when we talk of\ngravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active\npower. It was never the meaning of Sir ISAAC NEWTON to rob second\ncauses of all force or energy; though some of his followers have\nendeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the\ncontrary, that great philosopher had recourse to an ethereal active\nfluid to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious\nand modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to be\ninsisted on, without more experiments. In mentioning Newton's speculation that an aether might explain\nuniversal gravity in some sense (for instance, in query 21 to the\nOpticks), Hume does not appear to be concerned about action\nat a distance; instead, he is concerned to argue that this speculation\nindicates that Newton himself did not regard his theory as requiring\nthat we attribute a “power” of gravity to material\nbodies. This is important for Hume to establish, not least because he\nbelieves that we can form no representation at all of any such\npower. Similarly, when Newton indicates in the Principia that\nwe can conceive of a body's quantity of matter as its vis\ninertiae, its power of resisting any change to its state of\nmotion (Newton 1999: 404–5), he is not attributing any power to\nthat body, but rather employing a means of characterizing its\nbehavior. Or so Hume contends. In this specific regard, we find an\necho of Berkeley's earlier work: in De Motu, Berkeley argues\nin particular that although some philosophers misunderstand the\nNewtonian theory of gravity as attributing a special force or nature\nto material objects, there is an interpretation of Newton that is\nconsistent with the new theory of ideas. He writes (Berkeley 1992:\nDe Motu, §6): \nAgain, force, gravity, and terms of that sort are\nmore often used in the concrete (and rightly so) so as to connote the\nbody in motion, the effort of resisting, etc. But when they are used\nby philosophers to signify certain natures carved out and abstracted\nfrom all these things, natures which are not objects of sense, nor can\nbe grasped by any force of intellect, nor pictured by the imagination,\nthen indeed they breed errors and confusion. \nThere is little doubt, then, that the new British philosophy\nrepresented by Locke, Berkeley, and Hume in the early-to-mid\neighteenth century was concerned to present interpretations of\nNewton's work that were consistent with their overarching\nphilosophical commitments, principles and methods, or to alter those\ncommitments, principles and methods as necessary. In France, perhaps not surprisingly, the intellectual situation was\nrather different than in England. Cartesian ideas held sway for many\ndecades after Newton first emerged on the scene in the 1670s with his\noptics papers and in the late 1680s with the Principia; they\nwere especially popular at the Académie Royale des Sciences, unlike\nthe situation in the Royal Society (Henry 2013: 120). Voltaire became\nfamous for challenging the Cartesian French orthodoxy, traveling to\nEngland for a celebrated visit and bringing home\n“enlightened” ideas about philosophy, politics, and much\nelse besides in an attempt to foment the emergence and development of\na French Newtonian program. His most important publication in this\nregard is probably the Elements of the philosophy of Newton\n(Voltaire 1738/1992), which attempts to signal the\n“errors” of Descartes and to highlight the advantages of\nthe Newtonian program in “Physique”. Of course, Cartesian\nideas and methods retained numerous adherents and defenders in France,\nand so the debate between Cartesian and Newtonian ideas flourished in\nthat environment (cf. Aiton 1972: ch. 8). But even in France,\nCartesianism eventually gave way to a newer version of metaphysics\nassociated with Leibniz and his German follower and expositor,\nWolff. One of Voltaire's most significant collaborators, the French\naristocrat Émilie du Châtelet (formally, the Marquise du Châtelet),\npublished a key text in 1740, Institutions de physique\n(Foundations of physics), in which she argued that although\nthe best physics should be Newtonian rather than Cartesian,\nnonetheless the best metaphysics should be considered Leibnizian\nrather than Newtonian in spirit, if not in detail. In this\ntext—which was republished in a second edition in 1742 and\nswiftly translated into German and Italian—Châtelet makes\nprecisely the kind of argument that presses Hume a few years later to\narticulate a conception of the vis inertiae that is\nconsistent with the experimental philosophy. She argues that the\nCartesian view that extension is the essence of body is mistaken; we\nmust conceive of material objects as exhibiting a “force\nd'inertie” if we are to understand their physical\ninteractions properly (Châtelet 1742: ch. 1, §2). From her point\nof view, this Newtonian conception of body is not inherently\nproblematic; the problem arises when some Newtonians interpret the\ntheory of universal gravity as proving that bodies have a property of\nattraction or attractive power endowed by God (Châtelet 1742: ch. 16,\n§385). She accepts the idea that gravity is proportional to the\nmasses of bodies and inversely proportional to the square of their\nspatial separation, arguing that this Newtonian idea of attraction\n“marvelously” explains the fall of bodies on earth, the\ntides, and various astronomical phenomena, something that the vortex\ntheory of the Cartesians fails to do. But she denies that this\nacceptance entails that she must also accept the conclusion that\nbodies have an “essential property” called gravity or\nattractive force, contending that such a conclusion transcends the\nknowledge available to philosophers (Châtelet 1742: ch. 16,\n§388). In this specific way, Châtelet's work is predicated on the\nfamiliar notion that although Cartesianism has been properly\noverthrown by Newtonian ideas and methods, philosophers must\nnonetheless develop a proper interpretation of the Newtonian theory of\ngravity and of its implications. Yet unlike Voltaire, who not only\nrejected Cartesianism, but became famous for his ridicule of\nLeibnizian philosophy in Candide, Châtelet argued that\nphilosophers should continue to work on developing the proper\nmetaphysical foundations for natural philosophy much as Descartes had\nargued, only they should follow the ideas and methods of Leibniz and\nWolff. In particular, Châtelet argued that the principle of sufficient\nreason should be a guiding force in metaphysical theorizing, and as\nLeibniz had argued, it shows the fundamental error in Newton's concept\nof absolute space; she added that Clarke's method of replying to\nLeibniz's argument, viz., that one can develop a non-Leibnizan or\nvoluntarist conception of the PSR to evade the problem with absolute\nspace, is underwhelming (Châtelet 1742: ch. 5, §74). The great\nchallenge for Châtelet, of course, is to show in depth how she can\ndevelop a consistent system in which the natural\nphilosophy—especially the laws of motion and the theory of\ngravity—is Newtonian even while the metaphysics—especially\nthe commitment to a rationalist interpretation of the PSR and the\ncorresponding conception of space and time—is Leibnizian.\nClearly, many Newtonians and many Leibnizians would have rejected this\nproject as impossible. It would obviously be no small philosophical\nfeat to make the project succeed. Suitably modified, the project\nanimated much of Kant's work later in the century. The question of whether to accept, and of how to interpret,\nabsolute space, time and motion, and the related question of how to\nconceive of the relation between Newton's work in natural philosophy\nand the flourishing Leibnizian-Wolffian metaphysics on the Continent,\ncontinued to drive conversations in the middle of the eighteenth\ncentury. Just a few years after Châtelet published her\nInstitutions, the mathematician Leonard Euler presented a\nnovel approach to these two questions in a short paper entitled\n“Reflexions sur l'Espace et le Temps”, first published in\n1748 in the Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de\nBerlin. The Berlin Academy had been witnessing a vociferous\ndebate between Wolffians and Newtonians since 1740 (a debate that\nwould continue until roughly 1759), one in which Euler played a\nrole. Whereas one might regard the British philosophers, especially\nBerkeley and Hume, as arguing that philosophical principles and\ncommitments take a kind of precedence in driving one's interpretations\nof the concepts of force, motion, space and time, Euler argued that\nnatural philosophy—specifically, mechanics—ought to take\nprecedence. The famous first sentence of his essay indicates why: he\ncontends that the principles of mechanics—for instance, the\nprinciple of inertia—are so well established that it would be\nfoolish to doubt them (Euler 1748: 324). In particular, if one's\nmetaphysical commitments stand in tension with the concepts of space \nand motion found in geometry and mechanics, then one must adjust those\ncommitments accordingly. The most important figure in German-speaking Europe to react in\ndepth to Newton's ideas was surely Immanuel Kant, who was influenced\nby Euler's argument (Friedman 1992: 16–17) in the 1748\npiece.[26] Kant\nbegan grappling with Newtonian ideas at the very beginning of his\ncareer—he discussed the inverse-square law in his first\npublication (Kant 1747: § 10)—and they would remain central\nboth to his magnum opus, the Critique of Pure Reason (Kant\n1787/1992) and to his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience (1786/2002). Early in the so-called pre-critical period,\nKant diverged sharply from the approach toward natural philosophy\ndefended by many Leibnizians in German-speaking Europe by deciding to\naccept the Newtonian theory of universal gravity, along with\ncorresponding aspects of the Newtonian conception of matter, as a\nstarting point for philosophical theorizing (Friedman 2012:\n485–6). He makes this explicit already in 1763, in The Only\nPossible Argument: I will attempt to provide an explanation of the origin\nof the world system according to the general laws of mechanics, not an\nexplanation of the entire natural order, but only of the great masses\nof matter and their orbits, which constitute the most crudest\nfoundation of nature … I will presuppose the universal\ngravitation of matter according to Newton or his followers in\nthis project. If there are any who believe that through a definition\nof metaphysics formulated according to their own taste they can\nannihilate the conclusions established by men of perspicacity on the\nbasis of observation and by means of mathematical inference—if\nthere are such persons, they can skip the following propositions as\nsomething which has only a remote bearing on the main aim of this\nessay. (Kant 1763: AK 2: 139) A rare case of Kantian irony, it seems. Already in this early text,\nKant has clearly broken with his predecessors both in England and on\nthe Continent, who insisted on disputing Newton's theory of universal\ngravity, either on metaphysical or theological grounds.  Instead,\nKant's work will be predicated on that theory. But Kant never became\nan orthodox Newtonian, any more than an orthodox Leibnizian (or\nWolffian). This is evident from the radically different fates of two\nclassic Newtonian concepts within the Kantian system: the idea that\nthe theory of universal gravity shows that gravity is a feature of\nmaterial bodies, along with the related concept of action at a\ndistance, on the one hand; and absolute space, on the other. The\nquotation from 1763 above indicates that Kant was willing to endorse\nNewton's theory of universal gravity, despite the many objections\nraised against it by his Leibnizian predecessors. Indeed, he was also\nwilling to accept the most radical interpretation of that theory, one\naccording to which every material body in the world should be\nunderstood as bearing a feature called gravity, one that involves that\nbody in actions at a distance on all other such bodies. As Kant puts\nit dramatically in Proposition 7 of the second chapter of\nMetaphysical Foundations of Natural Science: “The\nattraction essential to all matter is an immediate action of matter on\nother matter through empty space” (Kant 1786/2002: 223; AK 4:\n512). This view is radical in two senses: first, it involves the\nhighly controversial claim that gravity is essential to matter, which\nindicates that a body lacking gravitational interactions would fail to\ncount as a material entity at all (much as an earlier generation of\nphilosophers would conceive of extension as essential to matter); and\nsecond, it also involves the debated idea that material bodies act at\na distance on one another. One can conceivably endorse the latter\nwithout endorsing the former, contending, e.g., that although material\nbodies in the actual world act at a distance on one another, perhaps\nbecause of a divine plan, it is perfectly possible for\nmaterial bodies to fail to do so under distinct worldly conditions\n(i.e., there may be possible worlds in which material bodies lack\ngravity altogether). That is, the endorsement of action at a distance\ndoes not entail the endorsement of the essentiality claim. Both ideas\nare controversial, and Kant strongly endorses them both. This placed\nhim in a rather select group of radical Newtonians (Friedman 1992: 1\nnote 2). Kant himself understood that Newton may not have endorsed\nthese controversial views, arguing that he was inconsistent on this\nscore (see Remark 2 to Proposition 7 of chapter 2, AK 4: 514–16;\nFriedman 2012: 203–21; Friedman 1990). And yet Kant strongly\nresisted the other most controversial Newtonian idea, absolute space,\nalong with the related idea of absolute motion (Friedman 2012:\n35–42). In the Critique of Pure Reason, for instance,\nKant expressed a basically Leibnizian sympathy by arguing that there\nare fundamental metaphysical (and perhaps epistemic) difficulties with\nthinking of space as existing independently of all objects and all\npossible relations among them, as “actual entities\n“(wirkliche Wesen—A23/B37) in their own right. He\ndoes so in a passage that (perhaps confusingly) characterizes the\nLeibnizians as also defending a kind of realism about space, but we\ncan focus solely on his criticism of the Newtonians: Those, however, who assert the absolute reality of space and time,\nwhether they assume it to be subsisting or only inhering, must\nthemselves come into conflict with the principles of experience. For\nif they decide in favor of the first (which is generally the position\nof the mathematical investigators of nature), then they must assume\ntwo eternal and infinite self-subsisting non-entities (space and\ntime), which exist (yet without there being anything real) only in\norder to comprehend everything real within themselves. (A39/B56) If one regards space (like time) as existing independently of all\nobjects and all possible relations, and yet one admits that space is\ncausally inert and imperceptible, as one presumably must in the late\neighteenth century, then one is committed to the idea that there is a\nkind of infinite and eternal non-entity in the world. Space is a kind\nof non-entity, Kant suggests, because on the one hand it is said to\nexist independently of everything else, and yet on the other hand, it\nis said to be causally inert and imperceptible, which would\ndistinguish it from every other sort of thing that exists. Kant simply\ncannot stomach this metaphysically preposterous notion. It is\ntherefore incumbent upon him to develop a theory of space (and of\nmotion) that meets at least two distinct criteria: (1) it coheres with\nhis understanding of the theory of universal gravity, and of what he\nregards as its implication, viz. that gravity is an essential feature\nof material bodies; and, (2) it avoids the metaphysically problematic\naspects of Newtonian absolute space. Kant tackles precisely these\ntasks in the Metaphysical Foundations, which was published in\nbetween the appearance of the first and of the second edition of the\nCritique, arguing that we can regard absolute space as a kind\nof idea of reason, an ideal that we approach asymptotically in our\ntheorizing about motion. Absolute space is therefore nothing more than\na kind of ideal within our philosophy, and no longer a harmful aspect\nof our ontology. Of course, Newton's influence on the development of philosophy did\nnot end with the close of the eighteenth century. Most obviously, the\nconcepts of absolute space and absolute motion continued to play\nfundamental roles in philosophical theorizing about space and motion\nmore generally for the next two centuries, and they remain fundamental\nto discussions today (DiSalle 2006). Newton has also had a deep and\nlasting influence on numerous other topics in what we now call the\nphilosophy of science, including the status of our knowledge of\nnatural phenomena, the best ideas about scientific methodology, the\nstatus of the laws of nature, and so on (McMullin 2001 and Smith\n2001).","contact.mail":"janiak@duke.edu","contact.domain":"duke.edu"}]
