Lange is a significant\nfigure among the mid nineteenth century German intellectuals who were\nconcerned to think through the impact of developments in natural\nscience for philosophy, pedagogy, and politics. \n\n\nLange was one of the originators of “physiological\nneo-Kantianism” and an important figure in the founding of the\nMarburg school of neo-Kantianism. He played a significant role in the\nGerman labour movement and in the development of social democratic\nthought. He articulated a socialist Darwinism that was an alternative\nto early social Darwinism. His work The History of Materialism and\nCritique of its Contemporary Significance was a classic text in\nmaterialism and the history of philosophy well into the twentieth\ncentury. The “materialism controversy” (see Beiser 2014a,\nchapter 9, and 2014b, chapter 2) centered on the impact of materialist\nscience and philosophy on religion and metaphysics. Lange’s\nresponse to the materialism controversy had an influence on the\nneo-Kantian movement and on Friedrich Nietzsche, among others. His\nwork in logic, culminating in the Logical Studies, derived\nthe syllogistic from diagrammatic reasoning, and was admired by Ernst\nSchröder and John Venn.\n\n\nLange’s sympathetic critique of materialism, his philosophical\nnaturalism, and his political activism unite his diverse achievements,\nand distinguish him among nineteenth century philosophers.\n\n\nLange was born on September 28, 1828 in Wald near Solingen, Germany.\nHe was the son of a protestant theologian, pastor and professor. Soon\nafter Lange was born, the family moved to Langenberg near Elberfeld\nand then in 1832 to Duisburg. Lange went to both elementary school and\nhigh school in Duisburg. The family moved in 1841 to Zurich so that\nhis father could take up the position as pastor and Professor of\nTheology that had been withdrawn from David Friedrich Strauss as a\nresult of Strauss’s controversial book, The Life of\nJesus. Lange continued his high school education in Zurich. Lange\nalso attended lectures at the university for two semesters on\nphilology and theology. He was exposed to both Hegel and Herbart in\nZurich. This exposure to Herbart influenced his later interests in\neducation theory, but more importantly led him back to Kant. In 1848\nhe went to study philology at the University of Bonn under Friedrich\nRitschl. Here he also took courses in philosophy, the history of\nclassical German literature, and analytic geometry and calculus. He\nfinished a dissertation on Greek poetry, “Quaestiones\nmetricae”, and was awarded his doctorate in\n 1851.[1] \nAfter doing his military service in Cologne, he became an assistant\nhigh school teacher there in 1852 at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium.\nAfter failing in three years to be promoted from assistant teacher to\nteacher, he resigned and received his habilitation\n(qualification as a university lecturer) at the University of Bonn. In\n1855 he became a Privatdozent of Philosophy and Pedagogy at the\nUniversity of\n Bonn.[2]\n His inaugural lecture was on the relation between the education\nsystems and dominant world views of various time periods (Lange\n 1855).[3]\n He gave lectures on psychology and pedagogy. He began lecturing on\nthe history of materialism during the summer of 1857. This was the\nbeginning of the research that would eventually yield his book,\nThe History of Materialism, many years later. He also gave\nlectures on “Moralstatistik”, the view popular in some\ncircles in the nineteenth century that there are statistical\ncorrelations between the rates of certain kinds of morally significant\nbehavior such as crimes, marriages, and suicides. Lange’s\nthoughts about how to reform logic also begin during this period even\nthough his book, Logical Studies, that eventually emerged\nfrom his investigations, was only published posthumously. It is\npresumably significant for his later views that during this time he\nheard Hermann von Helmholtz lecture on the “Physiology of the\nSense\n Organs”.[4] \nAfter failing to find a university position better than that of\nPrivatdozent, he accepted an offer to teach at his old school, the\nDuisburg Gymnasium. He taught there from 1858–1862. He gave\nclasses on Greek, Latin, German and philosophy. He was also busy\noutside the classroom writing reports for the school authorities and\nparticipating in politics as an elector. He wrote many articles for\nKarl Schmid’s encyclopedia of pedagogy during this time (Lange\n1869–75). This was the period when Lange really became\ninterested in, and became engaged with, politics. He became a\npolitical activist engaged in the then burgeoning German civil\nsociety. He participated in the organization of the new consumer\ncooperatives meant to help the working class avoid exploitation by\nmerchant traders—the traders sold low-quality goods at high\nprices and encouraged indebtedness. He was involved with the liberal,\nnationalist society, the Deutsche Nationalverein (whose\nmembers were later to form a similarly motivated political party, the\nDeutsche Fortschrittspartei) attempting to achieve German\nunification. \nThe political activism brought him into conflict with various\nauthorities. He had to quit his teaching post because of political\nproblems in 1862. The school authorities had issued a decree in\nJanuary warning teachers not to engage in “agitation”.\nLange attempted to organize the teachers against the decree. He\nfollowed this up with a spirited public defense of the view that\nteachers needed to be fully active citizens in order to lead their\nstudents, by example, to the life of a true citizen (Lange 1862).\nLange continued to resist attempts by the authorities to bring state\nemployees, including teachers, into line. Another warning followed in\nJune and, despite some failed attempts at reconciliation with the\nauthorities, Lange decided to leave his position at the end of the\nschool year. He became co-editor of the liberal Rhein- und\nRuhrzeitung and secretary of the Duisburg Chamber of Commerce.\nThe newspaper was an outspoken critic of the right-wing policies of\nBismarck, and already had strained relations with the authorities.\nLange also wrote for other papers and magazines, and often resorted to\npublishing short pamphlets that were widely distributed. He joined the\nmanagement of a small publishing house with the intention of\npublishing a series of popular works for the working class. \nDespite working on a liberal paper, his own position shifted in the\nsocialist direction. His political positions split the editorial staff\nof the newspaper, and alienated the members of the Chamber of\nCommerce. He soon left the newspaper because he thought it was not\ntaking the interests of the working class seriously enough. Similarly,\nhe broke with the Fortschrittspartei and what he took to be\nits anti-worker platform. \nA crucial event in his political development was his participation, a\nfew weeks after Ferdinand Lassalle’s death, in the second\nCongress of the German Workers’ Association, Vereinstag\ndeutscher Arbeitervereine (VDAV) in Leipzig in October 1864. The\nVDAV was founded initially as a counterweight to Lassalle’s more\nradical, more Prussian, Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein\n(ADAV) (General German Workers’ Association)—one of the\nancestors of the current Social Democratic Party. The VDAV was set up\nas a loose organization, in contrast again to the ADAV, but acquired\nmore structure later as the Federation of German Workers’\nAssociations, Verband Deutscher Arbeitervereine (and so kept\nthe same initials in German) (SED 1966, 216; Na’aman 1980).\nLange was there at the 1864 Congress as a representative of his\nDuisburg consumers’ cooperative. He was elected to the Standing\nCommittee and attempted to mediate between various factions, in\nparticular between the Lassalleans of the ADAV and the more liberal\nparticipants of the Congress. The politics were quite complicated,\nsince there were voices even further to the left of the leadership of\nthe ADAV, famously Marx and Engels. The disagreements were in essence\nabout which existing social, political, and economic structures and\nforces should or had to be accepted and worked within, and which could\nand should be replaced. The disagreements reflected splits between the\nmiddle class and the working class. Despite his role as mediator,\nLange was clear that the workers must not be co-opted for a middle\nclass, liberal agenda and that the workers’ movement as a whole\nmust remain focused on the class interests of the working class\n(Bernstein 1892, 139; Mehring 1908, 368). Lange failed to succeed in\nhis mediating efforts, and felt compelled to explain his own position\nin his Arbeiterfrage (The Labor Question) (Lange\n1865a). \nThese political fights pushed to the background Lange’s plans to\npublish short works for the working class. He did publish two smaller\nworks (Lange 1863b, 1865c). He was also writing his most famous book,\nThe History of Materialism, during this time. In his\nGrundlegung der mathematischen Psychologie (1865b), also\nwritten during this time, he indicated that he had already finished\nhis History of Materialism. It eventually came out in print\nin 1866. \nWith August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, Lange continued to try to\npush the VDAV to the left, from the initial liberal position of\nHermann Schulze-Delitzsch towards a position that took the interests\nof the working class itself more seriously (Bebel 1958, 103; Hundt\n1965; Na’aman 1980, xxv). He also joined the International\nWorking Men’s Association, the First International, in 1866\n(Weikart 1999, 84). As the political repression increased, newspapers\nwere no longer willing to publish Lange’s articles. Lange set up\nhis own newspaper, Der Bote vom Niederrhein, that ran from\nOctober 1865 to June 1866. Marx and Engels had turned down his initial\nrequest for support for such a newspaper (Lange 1968b, 78–79;\nIrmer 1975,\n 14).[5]\n Lange had intended the newspaper to help maintain unity within the\nworkers’ movement, but he failed in these efforts (Hundt 1965,\n694–96; Offermann 2002, 42, 147–148; Lange [1866] 1968a,\n23 May 1866, 3 June 1866). By the end of this period Lange was\npolitically isolated, having broken with the liberals, and being\nunwilling to fully join the socialists. He was also losing hope in the\nworking class, and felt that the left was being outmaneuvered by\nBismarck, in part because of the international military successes of\nBismarckian politics (Ellissen 1905, 7; Nipperdey 1985,\n790–803). Discouraged, he left for Switzerland. \nHe settled in Winterthur, became co-editor of the Winterthurer\nLandboten, and joined a friend’s publishing house. He\nbecame very involved in Swiss politics, particularly in the movement\nto reform the constitution and make it more democratic—a\nmovement that was particularly strong in his Zurich canton. He was on\nthe boards of many social organizations and on various state\ncommittees as an expert on education, banking, and the railways\n(Weinkauff 1883, 30). During this time, he also taught occasionally at\nthe Winterthur Gymnasium. He continued working on his contributions to\nSchmid’s education encyclopedia (Lange 1859–75) and he\nresponded to criticisms of the first edition of his History of\nMaterialism in Neue Beiträge zur Geschichte des\nMaterialismus (Lange 1867). \nIn 1869 he joined the Zurich faculty as a Privatdozent. He finished\nthe heavily revised second edition of the Arbeiterfrage in\n1870. In 1870 he also finally received a professorship at Zurich,\nthough, unfortunately, this happened quite soon after he was diagnosed\nwith cancer. Despite the illness he continued working on the second\nedition of The History of Materialism (Lange 1873–75).\nAfter rejecting offers from Königsberg and Würzburg, he\naccepted an invitation to take up a professorship at Marburg in 1872.\nHe gave lectures right till the end, but cancer eventually led to his\ndeath on 21 November 1875 in Marburg. \nOne of Lange’s earliest intellectual interests was in\ntheoretical questions about the purpose and method of education.\nBefore he had even taken up his first job as a high school teacher in\nCologne, he was already thinking and writing about reforming the\nGerman Gymnasium system. Like others, he was concerned that the\nemphasis on the classics in the Gymnasia failed to prepare students\nfor a time in which the natural sciences were increasingly important\n(Lange 1865a, 401). \nLange returned throughout his career to questions of pedagogy and the\nhistory of pedagogy. Knoll concludes that, despite his many\npublications and lectures on pedagogy, despite his collaboration with\nK. A. Schmid on the Encyklopädie des gesammten Erziehungs-\nund Unterrichtwesens, Lange appears not to have made a\nsignificant impact, either on his contemporaries or in the history of\npedagogy (Knoll 1975a, 8). He attempted to give lectures on pedagogy\nwhen he started teaching at the University of Bonn, but failed to\ngenerate any interest among the students for his lectures (Knoll\n1975b, 112–13). Knoll’s claims are dubious, however. As\nBeiser (2014a) points out, almost all professors at the time in Jena,\nfor instance, had trouble attracting students to their lectures\nbecause “there were not enough students” (p. 41).\nMoreover, Jacobsen (1999), Köhnke (1991), and others observe that\nMax Weber counted Lange’s lectures among his favorites (Jacobsen\n1999, 7 and passim), and that the pedagogist Friedrich Paulsen, and\nthe philosophers and pedagogists Paul Natorp and Hans Vaihinger, among\nothers, were influenced significantly by Lange’s work\n(Köhnke 1991, 211–213 and passim). Finally, Lange’s\ncolleague in Bonn, Friedrich Überweg, wrote in his well-known and\nwidely used textbook Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie\nnotes Lange’s influence on the pedagogist and educator Theobald\nZiegler (1846–1918) (p. 249). \nLange claimed that the purpose of education should be to produce\nrational, cultured citizens. Lange tried to show that turning to both\nthe history of education and the history of pedagogy would throw light\non the question of how to produce such citizens. The history of\neducation would help us understand the way in which social, cultural\nand political conditions interact to bring about specific kinds of\neducation in particular historical contexts (Lange 1855). \nCreating free citizens and leaders requires that the teachers\nthemselves be actively engaged in their communities as citizens.\nTeachers should not be prevented from political engagement, as only\npolitically engaged teachers will be able to communicate to their\nstudents the love of freedom and fatherland. As he was later to\nemphasize in his History of Materialism, simply instructing\npeople, including students, to be ethical—to be concerned with\nthe good of humanity in general—does not have much of an impact.\nIn the case of education one can have an impact by presenting a role\nmodel and by being a personal inspiration for one’s students.\nHis example is that of Thomas Arnold of Rugby, whom he believed was\nable to shape his students’ ethical views precisely because he\nwas so impressive as a person. This personality was the result of, and\nconstituted by, his active engagement with the political issues of his\ntime (Lange 1862). \nChristian virtues were for Lange an essential part of education;\nhowever, the relevant form of Christianity seems to be quite vague,\nindeed bordering at times on some form of “indeterminate\npantheism” (Knoll 1975a, 13). This is no surprise given his\nlater discussions of religion (see below). Education, in the inclusive\nsense of Bildung, also required instruction in philosophy.\nExposure to philosophy is an essential part of learning how to make\nreasoned decisions. There must also be education in politics. This\ngives one the requisite knowledge to participate in political affairs\nand helps prepare one for being a citizen (Knoll 1975b, 123). \nThe importance of education, and the crucial role of the freedom of\nthought in education, implied, for Lange, that any social entity\nshould have the right to set up schools and decide what should be\ntaught in them. The state should set up schools only where existing\nstructures of civil society have failed to generate enough schools.\nThe state should restrict the opening of a school only when it poses a\ngenuine threat to a legitimate state or explicitly promotes criminal\nactivity. There should be no requirement that there be any religious\ninstruction, let alone a requirement that any particular religion be\ntaught. In state schools, there should be no religious instruction\n(Lange 1968b, 125–127). \nLange tries to take a middle position on the relative importance of\nnatural talent and social environment for both the method and results\nof education. He grants that there probably are given differences in\ndispositions, but maintains that the environment has a significant\ninfluence on how these dispositions express themselves and on how\nstudents’ talents develop. He criticizes social Darwinist\ntheories that think there is no need to pay attention to the barriers\nto development created by the lack of economic or social privileges\n(Lange 1873–75, 255; Lange 1894a, 48–49). On the other\nhand, he warns against an idealism that assumes fundamental human\nequality of ability (Knoll 1975a, 19–20). \nFinally, Lange went against contemporary trends to argue that pedagogy\nshould be informed by the emerging science of empirical psychology;\nthough he granted that empirical psychology was a very young\ndiscipline that had so far failed to produce many compelling results\n(Lange 1859–1875, “Seelenlehre”, 142; Knoll 1975a,\n16). He emphasized the importance of statistical methods—an\nemphasis that was also quite prescient for the later development of\npedagogy (Knoll 1975a, 19). \nLange developed an interest in, and sympathy for, labor movements in\ntheir socialist and communist manifestations from the very early days\nof his university career. He should probably be regarded as occupying\na middle position between left liberalism and socialism. \nThe first edition of the Arbeiterfrage was created in\nresponse to heated debates about political strategy in the developing\nlabor movement. It was followed by a second and third edition that\ntook up more theoretical questions. The Arbeiterfrage was,\nlike the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and others of the\nperiod, shaped by a direct experience of rapid industrialization. A\ncrucial consequence of this industrialization was the generation of an\nimpoverished urban working\n class.[6]\n The heart of this process in Germany was in the Ruhrgebiet and in the\nRhineland, where Lange lived. Lange concluded that the solution to the\nproblem of what to do about the working class, the\n“Arbeiterfrage”—literally the “worker\nquestion”—as it was called, must come from the workers\nthemselves. This required politically organizing the workers and their\norganizations to form a front against the bourgeoisie (Irmer 1975,\n2). \nLange’s position is one of socialist Darwinism (as\nopposed to social Darwinism). Lange accepted a modified\nversion of Thomas Malthus’s concerns about the relation between\nincreases in population and food production: “The truth of the\nMalthusian theory consists therefore in this, that the growth of the\npopulation constantly reaches the limit that the growth of the means\nof subsistence permits” (Lange 1975b, 31; Weikart 1999, 86).\nThis is an essential part of the explanation of the social conditions\nof the working class. He quotes Darwin to emphasize that it is\npopulation pressure that lies behind the struggle for existence for\nall organisms. This, he emphasizes, includes humans (Lange 1894, 2).\nWithin capitalism, the struggle for existence for the working class\nbecomes a struggle for wages. \nMalthus granted in principle that measures like contraception could\nprevent the increase in population that reduces standards of living to\nthe subsistence level but he held out little hope. Lange was more\nsanguine, but the positive note in his book may have come too late to\nprevent its opening chapters from ensuring its unpopularity. The talk\nof the struggle for existence, and the rigid-sounding laws that govern\nit, could hardly have been inspiring to the workers’ movement it\nwas meant for (Mehring 1960, 352). Nonetheless, Lange did not draw the\nconclusions from Darwin that the social Darwinists did. He did not\ntake Darwinism as supporting capitalism, in part because he took it to\nbe a mistake to straightforwardly infer any normative conclusions from\nthe Darwinian explanatory claims. He seemed to regard the principles\nappealed to in Darwin and Malthus as natural tendencies that could be\nmitigated by human reason. These explanatory laws do not determine how\nwe should think, nor do they determine how we must inevitably\nthink: \nJust as human reason can control and mitigate the struggle for\nexistence among the plants we cultivate, it can control and mitigate\nthe struggle for existence among humans. \nOnce the quality of their living conditions becomes high enough, the\nworking class will become reasonable enough to be susceptible to\nrational arguments in favor of having a reasonable number of children.\nTheir lack of rationality in this matter is a result of their misery\nand ignorance. The improvement of living conditions to a sufficient\nlevel requires organizing the working class so that they can demand\nbetter wages and a decrease in the concentration of capital. This may\nbe possible while maintaining private property in the means of\nproduction, but, if not, we should try for communism, or whatever\nother path promises success, including various forms of mixed\neconomies. We will only learn slowly through experience what the best\nsystem is (Lange 1866a, 113–114; Lange 1894a,\n212–262). \nIt is important to note, given the political context in which Lange\nwas writing, that he did not seem to think that some revolutionary act\nwould bring us suddenly closer to such improved conditions of\nexistence. He saw the process of such development as a slow one.\nSimply changing the legal property relations or the official structure\nof the state will not be sufficient, he argues. What is required in\naddition to changes in the structure of the state and the legal system\nare fundamental changes in the way people think, which will always\ntake time. The reform of the state and laws provides the preconditions\nfor this change in consciousness, but does not bring about this change\nimmediately. Lange is careful not to deny that the kind of revolution\nsome socialists and communists supported could bring us closer to the\ngoal. But any such revolution would be merely one step in a long\nprocess that will involve both progress and regress (Lange 1894a,\n249–251). \nOn the other hand “the view that the state has nothing to do\nwith the matter” is just as mistaken (Lange 1894a, 250). Lange\ncriticizes the kind of self-help approach that some of the liberal\nmiddle-class, in particular Franz-Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch, famously\npushed. Schulze-Delitzsch believed that the goals of the liberal\nbourgeoisie and the working class did not have to be thought of as in\nconflict.The problems facing the working class could be dealt with\nwithin the existing capitalist mode of production. The working class,\nto put it crudely, could, thanks to the help of a series of consumer,\ncredit and production cooperatives, educate itself and save enough\nmoney to compete with capitalists on their own terms. Lange thought\nthis position was completely unrealistic, and that those who pushed it\nfailed to actually listen to the workers themselves. He criticized the\npaternalistic attitude of these liberal reformers and mocked their\ninability to even understand the dialects spoken by many of the\nworkers. \nMarx and Engels disagreed strongly with Lange’s position\n(Weikart 1999, 31; Marx and Engels 1975, 43: 158, 527–528). The\nview Engels expresses in a letter to Lange seems to be that taking the\nMalthusian view requires treating what is a historical law, in other\nwords a contingent law that holds during a particular mode of\nproduction, as an “eternal” law. The problem of producing\nenough is a problem generated by the existing mode of production. The\ntechnological means available then and in the future are and would be\nmore than enough to deal with any increases in population as long as\ncapitalism is overcome. Theories of eternal laws are part of an\nideology that supports the existing mode of production because they\npresent what are contingent laws as necessary, thus creating the\nimpression that the social order cannot be changed. This inhibits the\ninterest in changing society (Lange 1968b, 80–81; Marx and\nEngels 1975, 42: 136). \nThey also disagreed about the usefulness of Hegel. Lange suspected\nthat Hegelian dialectic, even in the more empiricist and materialist\nform that Marx deployed it, was not very useful for purposes of\nexplanation. He expresses his surprise that at a time in which Hegel\nwas no longer taken seriously in philosophy, Hegelian ideas could be\nso influential in the workers’ movement, in the thought of\nLassalle and Marx (Lange 1894a, 247–249, 260–262). Lange\nhad immense respect for Marx, and thought of him as the leading\neconomist of the time. However, he thought that when it came to\nMarx’s writings, the Hegelian “speculative form …\ntiresomely intrudes on the content of some parts of the work to the\ndisadvantage of its effectiveness” and undermines the effect of\nthe “astounding” display of detailed empirical evidence\n(Lange 1894a, 248). Lange also thought that the emphasis on\nrevolution, and the thought that a revolution could somehow suddenly\nchange the conditions of the working class and the mode of production,\nwas also the result of the negative influence of Hegel. Marx and\nEngels, on the other hand, were committed to some kind of dialectic\nform of explanation. Marx thought that Lange’s basic attitude\ntowards Hegel and dialectic was fundamentally\nmistaken—“simply childish”—and, indeed, showed\nthat Lange “understands rien [nothing] about\nHegel’s method and therefore, second, still less about my\ncritical manner of applying it” (Marx and Engels 1975, 43: 528).\nThere is evidence that Lange did understand what was at stake, though,\nas is shown by his clear discussion of idealism in psychology, and in\nthe study of nature in general, in his “Seelenlehre”\n(Lange 1859–1875, 144–45). \nLange had an indirect impact on what was later known as the\nrevisionist debate within socialism. Eduard Bernstein, the father of\nrevisionism, eventually broke with Marxian orthodoxy, and argued that\nachieving socialism did not require a revolution, or at least that\nmuch could be achieved by working within existing democratic political\nstructures. This was in part a result of Bernstein’s developing\nneo-Kantianism. He claimed that it was primarily Lange’s work\nthat led him to both Kant and revisionism (Vorländer 1900, 47;\nBernstein 1892). He suggests that when it comes to articulating a path\nforward for socialism, “I would translate ‘back to\nKant’ by ‘back to Lange’” (Bernstein 1902,\n187–88). \nThe domination of German philosophy by Hegelian Idealism for the first\nthird of the nineteenth century was followed by a revival of\nmaterialism. This was in part brought on by the criticisms of\nChristian theology and supernaturalism in David Friedrich\nStrauss’s The Life of Jesus and the criticisms of\nChristian theology and Hegelian idealism in the works of Ludwig\nFeuerbach, most famously in The Essence of Christianity. The\nrevival was also given impetus by the recent successes and the\nincreasing prestige of the natural sciences. This new materialism was\nrepresented by figures including Karl Vogt, Jacob Moleschott, Eugen\nDühring, Ludwig Büchner, and Heinrich Czolbe. These\nmaterialists explicitly took the natural sciences as their ideal.\nIndeed, many of them were practicing natural scientists. See Edgar\n(2015), sections 6.2, 6.5, and passim, for analysis of\nBüchner’s and Lange’s accounts of objectivity. \nLange thought that materialism faced serious philosophical problems;\nhowever, he also thought that Hegelian idealism was bankrupt. What was\nneeded was a philosophical approach that would be compatible with the\nrecent successes of materialistic explanations as deployed by the\nnatural sciences but not simply be a form of materialism. Lange was\none of the first in this period to argue that the appropriate response\nto the philosophical situation in Germany at the middle of the\nnineteenth century was to return to Kant. Beiser (2014) contains a\ncareful appreciation of Lange as a central figure in the “Coming\nof Age” of Neo-Kantianism; see Patton (2015) and Edgar (2015)\nfor reviews of Beiser. As Lange put it in a letter, “I take the\nHegelian System to be a step backward towards Scholasticism from which\nwe are really already free. Herbart, to whom I first attached myself,\nwas for me only a bridge to Kant, to whom so many honest researchers\nreturn in order to, where possible, complete what Kant had only half\ndone: the annihilation of metaphysics” (Ellissen 1894, 106).\nLange was thus one of the founding figures in what was to emerge as\nthe neo-Kantian movement rallied by Otto Liebmann’s slogan\n“Back to Kant!” \nWhile keeping much of the language of Kant, Hermann von Helmholtz,\namong others, worked to change the questions being asked in\nKant’s name and the methods used to find answers to these\nquestions. It is not easy to assess the degree of continuity between\nthe strands of neo-Kantianism that emerged and Kant’s own\ninterests. Lange is sometimes taken as the founder of the Marburg\nSchool of neo-Kantianism. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say\nthat Lange was a mentor of the first famous member of the Marburg\nSchool, Hermann Cohen. The other famous members were Paul Natorp and\nErnst Cassirer. \nThe appendices of the second volume of Holzhey (1986) contains\nCohen’s correspondence, including some correspondence between\nCohen and Lange. In general, Holzhey (1986) is an excellent source of\ninformation on the foundation of the Marburg School. Holzhey and\nBuée (2011) and Holzhey (2005) explore the relationship between\nCohen and Lange. Karl Vorländer published a review of\nCohen’s lengthy “Introduction” to Lange’s\nHistory of Materialism in 1897, in Kant-Studien.\nVorländer’s brief review nonetheless sets out a number of\ndifferences of method and conclusion between Cohen and Lange. In many\nways Hermann Cohen returned to a conception of the basic questions of\nepistemology that was closer to Kant’s, one Vorländer calls\n“critical idealism”. Lange, on the other hand, drew on\nHelmholtz’s early thought to conclude that the scientific\ninvestigation of the physiology of the sense organs provided partial\nconfirmation of Kant’s fundamental claims. \nIn the 1850s, Helmholtz had argued that contemporary science was\nconfirming on empirical grounds insights that Kant had had but that\nKant took as supported by a priori considerations. In his famous\naddress, “On Goethe’s Scientific Researches”, he\nclaimed: \nThe ground for this conclusion was supposed to be the fact, uncovered\nby physiology, that nerves are not faithful transmitters of external\nproperties to consciousness: \nHe then concluded: \nThus, “what the recent physiology of the senses has shown by the\nway of experience is what Kant had tried to show for the\nrepresentations of the human mind in general when he laid out the\nparticipation of the particular, built-in rules of the mind, the\norganization of the mind as it were, in our representations”\n(Helmholtz 1855, 58). \nHelmholtz thinks the confirmation of Kant goes further. The only way\nto get from the “world of sensations” to the “world\nof reality”, the “external world”, is through an\ninference. We infer that there is an external world because there has\nto be a “cause of our nerve excitations because there\ncan be no effect without cause.” But, Helmholtz asks, “How\ndo we know that there is no effect without a cause?” This is not\na principle we could learn from experience since it is the principle\nwe need in place before we can come to any conclusions about the world\nincluding the conclusion that cause follows effect. Thus, “the\ninvestigation of sensory perception also leads us to what\nKant had already recognized, namely that the principle,\n‘No effect without cause’, is a law of our thought given\nbefore all experience” (Helmholtz 1855, 77). \nThus, as he puts it later, what science shows us does not decide the\nquestion between idealism and realism: \nOne should wholeheartedly welcome the successes of natural science and\nempirical methodology, but the naive realism of the materialists was\nmistaken. The epistemological questions need to be taken\nseriously. \nLange’s most famous book, The History of Materialism and\nCritique of its Contemporary Significance, is in essence a\ndefense of such a return to Kant. It is also a detailed history of\nmaterialism (and was read well into the twentieth century for\nprecisely this reason). However, more fundamentally, it was meant to\ndrive home the above mentioned concerns about materialism. Lange\naccepted materialism as a sensible maxim for the construction of\ntheories within natural science. However, as a comprehensive\nphilosophical system, as both fundamental ontology and epistemology,\nmaterialism is self-undermining. \nLange’s History is divided into two parts. The first\npart covers the history of materialism from the atomism of Democritus\ntill the time of Kant. It includes discussions of what Lange considers\nto be reactions to materialism: the philosophical positions of Plato\nand Aristotle and the theological positions taken by both Christian\nand Muslim scholars. He includes a discussion of the dominance of\nAristotelianism in the writings of the Scholastics. Materialism\nfinally returns with the regeneration of science. In this context,\nafter discussions of Gassendi and Hobbes, he turns to Newton and\nLocke. Finally he treats Leibniz as a German reaction to\nmaterialism. \nThe second part covers the history of materialism from the time of\nKant. The opening section of this part is a discussion of Kant’s\nown position in relation to materialism and sets the stage for\nLange’s “back to Kant” arguments. These arguments\nare directed against the contemporary forms of materialism mentioned\nabove. \nLange claims that “the empirical method has celebrated its\nhighest triumph” in the physiology of the sense organs. But this\ntriumph “at the same time … leads us to the very limits\nof our knowledge, and betrays to us at least so much of the sphere\nbeyond it as to convince us of its existence” (Lange\n1873–75, 3:202; see also 2:158). Such physiological\ninvestigation into the sense organs may initially look favourable for\nthe materialists, in that it promises to give us a materialistic\naccount of our knowledge of the world. In fact, it is deadly to\nmaterialism as an ontology. Physiology shows us that the sense organs\ndo not show us how the world really is and indeed that our very\nconcept of matter may have nothing to do with what is really there in\nthe world (Lange 1873–75, 3:\n 205–19).[7] \nThe arguments Lange deploys are drawn from research into the\nphysiology of perception, by materialist researchers and by Helmholtz\nhimself. For example, Lange claims that the physiology of our eyes\nshows that the visual sensation of a single three-dimensional object\nin front of me is in fact a composite generated from the two\ntwo-dimensional stimulations of each of my retinas (Lange 1873-75,\n3:203). Supposedly we learn that even the simplest of sensations is\nnot the result of a single natural process, but the combination of\nmany different processes (3:203–204). Furthermore, we learn that\n“colours, sounds, smells, &c., do not belong to things in\nthemselves, … they are peculiar forms of excitation of our\nsensibility, which are called forth by corresponding but qualitatively\nvery different phenomena in the world” (3:217). Indeed,\naccording to these physiological accounts, only a very specific set of\nvibrations is picked out and the rest are ignored (3:217). We learn\nthat there is a blind spot on the retina but that the brain fills in\nthe spot when constructing our image of the world (3:220). The\nconclusion Lange wants us to draw from all of this is that the world\nwe think we see is radically different from the way the world really\nis by materialism’s own lights. \nLange considers the possibility that many of these then commonplace\narguments could perhaps be seen merely as arguments in favour of a\nsubjective account of secondary qualities and that one could respond\nby insisting that nonetheless the empirical theory we construct gives\nus a correct account of the primary qualities. Indeed, for all that\nhas been said, someone might argue, we may still be warranted in\nthinking that reality is composed of bodies in motion in space.\nHowever, Lange wants to resist even this move, the “last refuge\nof Materialism” as he calls it (3:224): \nPhysical space, for example, could easily be, Lange claims, of more\nthan three dimensions without that having any effect on our phenomenal\nworld (3:227). Thus materialism, as the belief in “material,\nself-existent things” is thoroughly undermined: the\n“consistent Materialistic view thus changes around, therefore,\ninto a consistently idealistic view” (Lange 1873–75,\n3:215, 223). \nIn trying to understand Lange’s position, it is helpful to see\nthe kind of view he thinks would in principle escape these worries.\nLange considers one version of materialism in his book that he thinks\ndoes not undermine itself. This is the position of Heinrich Czolbe,\nthe author of Neue Darstellung des Sensualismus. Lange\ncredits him for being the only one among the materialists to truly\nface up to the problems regarding perception generated by materialism\nfor itself (Lange 1873–75, 2: 105).  \nCzolbe gets credit from Lange for facing up to the self-undermining\nnature of materialism, precisely because Czolbe takes as central the\nproblem created by the above mentioned empirical arguments about the\nnature of nerve processes in sense organs. He takes this to be the\nproblem that Feuerbach, Vogt, Moleschott, and others have not dealt\nwith adequately (Czolbe 1855, vi; Lange 1873–75, 3:286). Indeed,\nCzolbe complains that the physiologists play right into the hands of\nthe speculative, idealistic philosophers, because they do not think\nthrough the philosophical consequences of their physiological theories\n(Czolbe 1856, 27–28). The only way to defeat the speculative\nphilosophers, Czolbe argues, is to insist that sensory qualities are\nmechanically propagated through the nerves without any change (Czolbe\n1855, 14; 1856, 15–16, 27–28). His view appears to be that\nqualitative properties such as colours or sounds are transmitted\ndirectly from the outside to the inside. The suggestion is that\ncolours and sounds exist independently of the subject. They are not\ngenerated by the nerves, rather, they are transmitted to the inside of\nthe brain by the nerves. Of course, Czolbe was not ignorant of wave\ntheories of light or sound, but claimed that the wave particle already\nis the colour or sound, which has only to be transmitted to the right\nspot in the brain in order for us to be conscious of it. As Lange\nmockingly emphasizes, the sound waves somehow involve the experience\nof their sound in themselves already (Lange 1873–75, 2:111).\nCzolbe appears to bite this bullet, and accepts Hermann Lotze’s\ndescription of his view, according to which \nIf this were the correct view of how the sense organs work, then,\nCzolbe claims, we would have an empirical account of knowledge that\nwas not self-undermining. \nOne immediate problem was how to defend such a view against the\nempirical evidence then available. Consider, for example, something\nCzolbe was aware of, namely, the presence of electrical currents in\nnerves. The worry for Czolbe is that light waves end up being\nconverted to electrical currents in the nerves, which might lead back\nto the supposedly self-undermining empirical stories of the other\nmaterialists. Czolbe’s response is first to point out that it is\npossible that both electricity and light—not just light waves\nbut the sensations of light—could be transmitted at the same\ntime. He then points to supposed empirical data that at the moment of\nexcitation the electrical current in the nerve weakens. This, he\nthinks, is decisive evidence that the electrical current is not\nresponsible for transmission since if it were, the electrical current\nwould have to increase at the moment of excitation rather\nthan decrease (Czolbe 1855: 16–17). \nLange concedes that Czolbe’s materialism, were it to actually be\nsupported by empirical evidence, is in principle able to avoid\nundermining itself. To Lange, though, Czolbe has to twist the\nempirical evidence, and so Czolbe’s materialism ultimately does\nundermine itself. Lange accuses Czolbe of being obstinate and treating\nthe results of scientific investigations in an unscientific manner, as\nmere illusions that would disappear on closer examination (Lange\n1873–75, 2:291). \nLange thus thinks he has good grounds for drawing the following\nconclusions from his discussion of physiology and materialism: \nHe sees himself as agreeing with Helmholtz when Helmholtz\n“resolves the activity of the senses into a kind of\ninference” (Lange 1873–75, 3:228). It does not follow, he\nemphasizes, that “the search for a physical mechanism of\nsensation, as of thought, [is] superfluous or inadmissible. At length,\nhowever, we see that such a mechanism, like every other represented\nmechanism, must be itself only a necessarily occurring picture of an\nunknown state of things” (Lange 1873–75, 3:229). He\nconcludes: \nThat we do not have knowledge of this transcendent order shows us that\nall metaphysics is, like art, a creation of the imagination.\nNonetheless we should still “in natural science everywhere apply\nthe same conceptions and methods as the Materialist; but what to the\nlatter is definitive truth is to the Idealist only the necessary\nresult of our organisation” (Lange 1873–75, 3:324). \nAs the nineteenth century came to a close, critics of the Back to Kant\nmovement, including Ernst Mach, began to question Helmholtz’s\nand Lange’s appeal to the thing in itself. Edgar (2012)\nidentifies a “deep tension”: Helmholtz and Lange\n“wanted to conceive of things in themselves as the causes of our\nsensations, while their own accounts of causal inference ruled that\nclaim out” (p. 1). Edgar (2012) goes on to argue that\n“These Neo-Kantians’ problems with things in themselves\nwere fully solved only by Ernst Mach, in the context of the\nuncompromisingly austere theory of knowledge he developed in the early\n1880s, in his 1882 ‘The Economical Nature of Physical\nInquiry’ and his 1884 ‘Contributions to the Analysis of\nSensations’” (p. 2). While Mach is critical of Helmholtz\nand of Lange, Edgar emphasizes nonetheless that: \nIn summer 2015, a special issue of Philosophical Readings,\nedited by Pietro Gori, focused on “Anti-metaphysical\nPsychology”. Gori (2015b) and Martinelli (2015), especially,\nfocus on Lange’s place within the tradition of “psychology\nwithout a soul”, as Lange and Brentano dubbed it. The work of\nMichael Heidelberger (2015, among other works) investigates\nLange’s place in the physiological tradition. \nLange’s History of Materialism is known to have had an\ninfluence on Friedrich Nietzsche, who learned about Gustav Fechner and\nothers in the “psychophysics” movement from Lange’s\nwork. Nietzsche went on to re-define philosophy as\n“psycho-physiology” in Beyond Good and Evil\n(Nietzsche 2002/1886, 23, see also Gori 2015a). George L.\nStack’s Lange and Nietzsche brought the question of\nLange’s influence on Nietzsche to the forefront. For critical\nresponses see Breazeale (1989), Seigfried (1989), Wilcox (1989), and\nPletsch (1991); also see Salaquarda (1978, 1979, and 1996). Stack\nresponds to critics in Stack (1989 and 1991). More recently, R. Kevin\nHill assesses the influence of Lange, Schopenhauer, and Kant on\nNietszche’s thought (2003); for a critical perspective see Clark\nand Dudrick (2005). \nThe section following details Lange’s criticisms of metaphysics\nand religion on the basis of materialism and scientific achievement,\nand his argument that the ethical standpoint, like metaphysics, is a\ncreation of the imagination like Schiller’s poetry. These ideas\nare perhaps one reason why Nietzsche himself cited Lange as an\ninfluence on his thought.  \nAccording to Beiser’s account (2014b), Lange’s work in\nThe History of Materialism “succeeded in throwing the\nmaterialists back on the defensive” (p. 95).\n“Lange’s book,” Beiser writes, “appealed to\neveryone who wanted the materialist critique of religion and its\nscientific program but who also could not approve of its naive\nmetaphysics and its failure to account for basic human values”\n(p. 95). \nFor Lange, the realization that metaphysics is a creation of the\nimagination, similar to art, opens up a way to respond to the damaging\nethical consequences of the materialistic world view. Though he does\nseem to think that the materialistic world views of many of his\ncontemporaries influence their ethics, it is less clear whether Lange\nthinks that the kind of materialism discussed above actually entails\nany ethical positions. At times Lange claims that both a normative\nprinciple of ethical egoism and a principle of sympathy for humanity\ncan both be “derived” [abgeleitet] from\ntheoretical materialism (Lange 1873–75, 3:260, 303). It is\nperhaps most charitable to read Lange as suggesting that there is\nnothing in materialism that requires one principle or the other, but\nthat one could find oneself attracted to either principle, even if one\nstarted from theoretical materialism. His considered view appears to\nbe that materialists have a plausible explanatory account for certain\nkinds of human behaviour, but that they slide from this plausible\nexplanatory account to problematic normative claims. His label\n“ethical materialism” seems to be a label for the kind of\nethical positions that materialists tend to accept as a matter of\nsociological or psychological fact rather than some particular ethical\nposition required by materialism. \nLange begins by granting that regarding humans as egoists concerned\nonly with satisfying their desires may well be an abstraction that\nallows for some degree of predictive success when it comes to\nexplaining human behaviour in the marketplace. The mistake the\nmaterialist makes is “in confounding this abstraction with\nreality” (Lange 1873–75, 3:233–237). The materialist\nassumes that the abstraction of the rational egoist is an accurate\npicture of all of human behaviour and, perhaps even more damagingly,\nan ethical ideal for how we should behave. Part of the problem is that\nethical materialism has a mistaken account of the human good. It\nclaims that “a man is all the happier the more wants he has, if\nhe has at the same time sufficient means for their satisfaction”\n(Lange 1873–75, 3:239). This is mistaken because what matters is\nthe nature of the want and, so Lange, the way the want comes about and\nis satisfied (Lange 1873–75, 3:241). Finally serious concerns\nabout issues of distributive justice are avoided by what Lange\nconsiders to be quite implausible appeals to “invisible\nhand” arguments (Lange 1873–75, 3:242–259). As in\nthe case of Marx, this does not mean that Lange denies the usefulness\nof markets in increasing productivity and encouraging technical\ninnovation. The problem with markets is that they generate inequality\nand hinder human flourishing. \nLange thinks that materialism, or rather science in general, will\nundermine religion, or at least traditional forms of it. He takes\nseriously the concern that this might also undermine moral commitment.\nHe points out that it is not obvious how effective religion really is\nin influencing moral behaviour. The New Testament’s claim that\nit is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for\na rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven seems to have little impact\non the acquisitiveness of contemporary Christian capitalists,\n“while the servants of the Church sit at the tables of the rich\nand preach submissiveness to the poor” (Lange 1873–75,\n3:270–271). Such Christian ideas have encourageduniversalistic\nconcern and have combatted egoism and this, other things equal, is\nmorally beneficial. What prevents these ideas from having more\ninfluence, and more of a purely positive influence, is the dogmatic\nform in which they appear, and the nature of the institution of the\nChurch itself. The power of the Church to force the acceptance of its\ndogmas not only results in unwarranted beliefs but also in a general\ndebasement of our mental abilities (Lange 1873–75, 3:275). \nReligion, like the other creations of our imagination, can have a\npowerful influence. The mistake is to confuse such creations with the\nknowledge that science provides (Lange 1873–75, 3:280). Lange\nthinks that “the classification of religion with art and\nmetaphysics will at no very distant time be generally conceded”.\nThe “great mass of believers of all religions” are\n“in a state of mind like that in which children listen to\nfairy-tales” (Lange 1873–75, 3:281). The coming\nrealization though that these are all fairy tales does not mean that\n“the sense for poesy” is not important even when we are,\nso to speak, adults (Lange 1873–75, 3:281). When it comes to\n“the direction of the impulses towards the general good”,\nthen “mere moral teaching will hardly be likely to produce a\nframe of mind to which trumpet-peals and hymns are appropriate”\n(Lange 1873–75, 3:299). We need to set up ideals, indeed\n“[o]ne thing is certain, that man needs to supplement reality by\nan ideal world of his own creation”. This ideal world, these\nmyths, are meant to inspire us to be moral and help us overcome\n“spiritual impoverishment” just as the myths, the ideals,\nof Christianity can, at their best, inspire us (cf. Kant 1787,\nA569/B597 and Kant 1793, §17). His model is Schiller’s\nphilosophical poetry (Lange 1873–75, 3:342–44; Lange\n1897). \nBut what are these myths supposed to inspire us to? Are there\nconstraints on which myths we should create? This is not always clear\nin Lange. As we have seen it does seem that at least we are supposed\nto be inspired to be moral. This suggests that at least morality\nitself is not a myth. But if it is not a myth, then does this mean\nthat we have some way of knowing moral truths—that morality\nsomehow escapes the problems raised for other areas of purported\nmetaphysical knowledge? Again, Lange’s writings on this point\nare not clear and there is some evidence that he was not quite sure\nwhat position to take. Given the general emphasis on Kant, it comes as\nno surprise that Lange would take seriously what Kant has to say about\nthis. What variation on Kant’s view he finally accepts though is\nharder to discern. \nThe version of Kant’s view that Lange considers is the one\npresented in the Critique of Practical Reason. Lange’s\nfocus on this version, like his interpretation of Kant’s views\non theoretical reason, set him apart from many later Kant scholars.\nThe Critique of Practical Reason shares with Kant’s\nother writings the claim that there is a fundamental law of practical\nreason which is also the moral law. It focusses though on one\nparticular formulation of this law: “So act that the maxim of\nyour will could always hold at the same time as a principle in a\ngiving of universal law”. What is distinctive about the\nCritique of Practical Reason is that Kant then\nproceeds to give a distinctive account of how we come to know this law\nor how this law is justified. He writes: \nAccording to this “fact of reason” version, we seem to\nhave a particular moral law forced on us in our mental lives and we\nare unable to give any deeper justification of this moral law—it\nis just a fact that we have to accept. It is a fact that I am bound by\nthe moral law. However, I could not be bound by the moral law unless I\ncould follow it and I cannot follow this moral law unless I am free.\nKant thus argues that we can conclude for practical purposes that we\nare free. \nLange seems to accept the content of the law, and treats it as\nsupporting the kind of universalistic and impartial concern he sees as\nstanding in opposition to egoism. However, he is clearly worried about\nwhether Kant has really succeeded in providing a justification for the\nmoral law. \nIn the first edition of his History, he claims that any moral\nphilosophy could use this strategy and thus that “if Kant\nbelieves that he has absolutely proved his [moral philosophy], then he\nsimply commits the usual mistake of all metaphysicians”. In the\nfirst edition, this claim comes near the end of the section on Kant,\nand is immediately followed by a summary of what he takes to be\nKant’s “Copernican Revolution”: (i) “The world\nof appearances is a consequence of our concepts”. (ii)\n“The ideas”, in Kant’s sense presumably of concepts\nof reason whose objects are not such that they could be met in\nexperience (Kant 1787, A311/B368-A320/B377), “give us no\nknowledge, rather they lead us to an imagined world. It is precisely\nin this that their usefulness lies. We deceive ourselves when we try\nto increase our knowledge through them; we enrich ourselves when we\nmake them the foundation of our actions.” (iii) “The one\nabsolute that man has is the moral law and from this fixed point a\nsecure order can be brought to the unstable world of the ideas”.\nAfter this summary of what he takes to be Kant’s position, Lange\ndeclares his support for (i) and (ii) but seems to reject (iii) for\ngrounds similar to those we have already seen. Kant’s claim that\nhis moral law is a fixed point is somehow “subjective” and\nshows Kant as being a child of his times. According to Lange, the\nlasting achievement of (iii) is the more general claim that “the\nideal is no longer to be judged by supposed evidence but rather by its\nrelationship to the ethical ends of mankind” (Lange 1866b,\n277–78). This is where the discussion of the fundamental moral\nlaw in the first edition ends. It leaves open the question of what\nethical ends are supposed to be used to judge the ideals we create in\nour myths, and of how we are supposed to defend these ethical ends\nwithout becoming metaphysicians. \nIn the second edition of his History, the claims quoted in\nthe previous paragaph have been removed. After giving a brief summary\nof Kant’s appeal to a “fact of reason” and his\nargument for freedom, Lange does not go on to suggest that Kant may be\nmaking the mistake of all metaphysicians. Rather, he writes: “So\nfar Kant’s doctrine of freedom is perfectly clear\nand—apart from the question of the a priority of the\nmoral law—invulnerable” (Lange 1873–75, 2:229). What\nfollows is a new discussion of Kant’s conception of our freedom\nand worries about our freedom being apparently restricted only to the\nnoumenal realm. Lange does return to declarations in favour of\nconstructing ideals, but gives no further explanation of how we are\nsupposed to find ethical ends, or a moral law, that guides the\nconstruction of these ideals, nor, for that matter, what problem in\nspecific lies behind the above mentioned “question of the a\npriority of the moral law” (Lange 1873–75). \nOne possible reason for the changes to the material on Kant between\nLange’s first and second editions is the influence of Hermann\nCohen, Lange’s protege and the founder of the Marburg School of\nNeo-Kantianism. As Sieg (1994) details, Cohen published his major work\nKant’s Theory of Experience in 1871, in which he\ncriticized “Lange’s understanding of the Kantian a priori\nas a naturalist misinterpretation” (p. 104). By November 1871,\nLange and Cohen were in correspondence, and Lange indicated that he\nwas impressed by Cohen’s criticisms. According to Sieg (1994),\nLange’s second edition shows that he is interpreting the Kantian\nthing in itself as a “limiting concept [Grenzbegriff]” in\nCohen’s sense (p. 104). For an account of the development of\nLange’s thought on this score, and of the mutual influence of\nLange and Cohen, see Adelmann (2012), pp. 83–93. \nBeiser (2014b) suggests that some of the changes between the first and\nthe second editions of the History of Materialism were\nprompted by a sea change in the prevailing view in the natural\nsciences. The older theories of Czolbe, Büchner, and Vogt had\nbeen spectacularly superseded by Darwinism and its interpretations by\nhis German exponents, Ernst Häckel and Carl Gegenbauer (p. 96).\nBeiser notes that Darwinism’s triumph should not be read as\n“a vindication of materialism itself” (p. 96). As Hermann\nLotze observes, Darwin’s explanations of organisms and species\ndid not require that those organisms or species be viewed as reducible\nto solely material objects (see Beiser 2014b, p. 96). Nonetheless, the\nincreasing dominance of Darwinism in Germany meant that the\nmaterialist program dwindled in influence as a scientific project, and\nso its broader impact was checked as well. Lange’s death in 1875\ncoincided with the rise of Darwinism in Germany, and thus his\nresponses to this change in the intellectual context were limited.\n \nWhen Lange died in 1875, he was working on a revision of the\nHistory of Materialism, and on the first part of a work\ncalled the Logische Studien (Logical Studies).\nHermann Cohen saw the Logische Studien to press and wrote a\nshort introduction. While the argument of the Logische\nStudien remains incomplete, it makes several contributions, some\nahead of their time. Thiel (1994) and Patton (2011) are appreciations\nof the Logische Studien, Wille (2011) is a review of Patton\n(2011). Bellucci (2013) examines accounts of diagrammatic reasoning in\nLange and in Charles Sanders Peirce. \nThe first chapter of the Logische Studien situates\nLange’s text in the tradition of wissenschaftliche\nErkenntnisstheorie, loosely, scientific epistemology. This tradition\nresponds to the successes of materialism and empirical science\nmentioned above, by focusing on scientific methodology. Johann\nHerbart, a founder of empirical psychology, and Friedrich Adolf\nTrendelenburg, a philosopher and classicist, are particularly\nimportant for Lange (see Patton 2011, Haaparanta 2009). Herbart had\nargued that scientific methodology and inference could be based on\npsychology (Maigné 2002, Hatfield 1990). Trendelenburg responds\nthat the logic of science should establish how the content of\nscientific theories is proven with certainty, which cannot be\naccomplished within any particular science, but only in an overall\ncritique of scientific thought and methods (Trendelenburg 1862,\n9–10).  \nLange responds to Herbart by arguing that, while the synthesis of\nrepresentations (in Kant’s sense) can be explained\npsychologically, the reasons why that synthesis are necessary and\napply to objects are not reducible to psychology. However, Lange does\nargue that the natural and the normative explanations of necessity are\ncompatible, and that this explains our access to normative\nconclusions. As Ernst Schröder points out, “In striving for\nour goals, we can thus take comfort in the belief that under certain\nknowable conditions the objective necessity that we are searching for\nwill always also become subjective. Namely, if we are talking about\nthe unification of unmediated contradictions, then both formal\nnecessities will always occur together. In this context, F. A. Lange\nremarks very aptly, ‘The law of non-contradiction is the point\nat which the natural law of thought comes into contact with\nthe normative law’” (Schröder (1890),\n11–13, citation from Lange (1877), 27–28). \nLange agrees with Trendelenburg that logic, like epistemology of\nscience, ought to concern itself with an analysis of necessity, which\ninforms Lange’s response to Herbart. However, Lange disagrees\nwith Trendelenburg on the status of logic. Trendelenburg was what\nmight be called a neo-Aristotelian logician. He wrote several works on\nAristotelian logic, especially the logic of the categories. As such,\nTrendelenburg works on what Lange refers to as the “traditional\nlogic of content”. Lange considers that this has been superseded\nby the new, English “logic of extension,” associated with\nJohn Venn and others.  \nOne major goal of Lange’s book is thus to show that the formal\ninferences of Aristotelian logic, the syllogistic, can all be captured\nwithin the logic of extension, which might now be called propositional\nlogic. Lange accomplishes this in the next few chapters of the book.\nHe does so by using Euler-Gergonne diagrams, which would now be called\nVenn diagrams—but Lange died before Venn first published the\nVenn diagrams in 1880 (in “On the Forms of Logical\nProposition”, in the journal Mind). In Symbolic\nLogic, published the following year, Venn remarks: \nAnother major goal of the book is to argue for the notion that all\ncertain or “apodictic” (sometimes spelled\n“apodeictic”) scientific inference is the same in kind.\nAgain, although Lange does not agree with Herbart that a naturalistic\ndescription of thought can capture the necessity of scientific proofs,\nhe disagrees with the notion that only derivation from a priori\nprinciples yields certain knowledge. The year after Lange’s book\nappeared, J. A. Stewart reviewed the work in Mind,\nsaying: \nAs Lange puts it, \nLange tries to steer a middle course, between “the\nmetaphysicians’ account” and the “bare”\nmaterialism he rejects in the History of Materialism. This\nleads him to reject Hegelian idealism (see above), but also to put\ninto question some elements even of the Kantian system. Seventy-four\nyears before the publication of Quine’s “Two Dogmas of\nEmpiricism”, Lange explicitly rejects the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction: \nA recurring theme in the Logische Studien is Lange’s\nbelief in the essential unity of apodictic, certain and necessary,\njudgments. It is for this reason that he does not think the methods of\nscience can be reduced to derivation from metaphysical first\nprinciples, to the inferences of analytic formal logic, or to a\nnaturalist, purely descriptive psychology.  \nLange’s commitment to the unity of valid inferences even leads\nhim to reject another Kantian distinction, that between thought and\nintuition:  \nLange’s rejection of two distinctions central to Kantian thought\nare one argument against placing him squarely in any neo-Kantian\ntradition. However, Lange’s work in the Logische\nStudien and in the “Standpoint of the Ideal” chapter\nare difficult to reconcile with a purely empiricist stance either, so\nhe is difficult to place in the philosophical tradition. In addition,\nLange concludes the Logische Studien with an intriguing, but\nsomewhat perplexing, appeal to neo-Platonist thought in explaining his\ntheory of space and time. In general, while it is true that Lange\nproposed rejecting these fundamental Kantian distinctions, there is\nreason to question whether he conceived of a coherent view that\ndispenses with them. For instance, Lange suggests that certain logical\ninferences are based on manipulations of the “formal”\naspects of our representations, but, arguably, Lange does not explain\nhow we are to distinguish formal from material in this context (see\nPatton 2011, 150–151). \nThe footnotes and first chapter of the Logische Studien\nreveal the extent to which Lange was engaged in discussions with\nphilosophers in Bonn and in Berlin who were particularly interested in\nthe methodology of science, including Hermann Cohen, Friedrich Adolf\nTrendelenburg, Friedrich Überweg, and others. These late\nnineteenth century discussions set the stage for the work of more\nwell-known philosophers of science of the early twentieth century.\nLange’s work in this context is a counterpoint to the\nneo-Kantian and materialist traditions. \nLange’s work was seen as a potent response to the intellectual\nand practical crises provoked by the materialist positions dominant in\nGermany in the mid-19th century. Along with the neo-Kantians including\nCohen and Windelband, Lange saw the positions of Czolbe, Vogt,\nBüchner, and other materialists as (justifiably) undermining\nlong-held religious and metaphysical positions. Drawing on his views\non practical pedagogy and workers’ rights, Lange developed a\nform of “socialist Darwinism” (Weikart 1999) and defended\na Kantian “ethical standpoint of the ideal” to replace\nwhat he saw as religious and metaphysical dogmatism. Beiser (2014a)\ncorrectly observes that Lange “never really connected his\nNeo-Kantianism with his socialism” (p. 357). However, Lange\ncontinued work in both traditions until his death. \nThroughout his career, Lange was remarkable for the integration of his\npolitical and practical positions into his intellectual life. As\ndiscussed in section 1 above, his engagement in the workers’\nmovement led him to participate in the second Congress of the German\nWorkers’ Association. He formulated his political views in\nDie Arbeiterfrage of 1865, which in turn led him to\nintellectual engagement with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, among\nothers. See Hirsch 1977, SED 1966, Marx and Engels 1975,\nVorländer 1900, Berdiajew 1900, Heid 1983, Hundt 1965, Mehring\n1908, Na’aman 1980, and related works in the reference list\nbelow for further detail. \nLange’s influence on nineteenth and twentieth century thought\nincluded, but was not limited to, his influence on the nascent Marburg\nschool of neo-Kantianism (in this respect, see Sieg 1994, Köhnke\n1991, Holzhey 1986). His engagement with Darwinism, materialism,\nsocialism, and Marxism contributed to his “unusually\nstrong” presence in the “intellectual climate of the final\nquarter of the nineteenth century” in Germany (Jacobsen 1999,\n7). Max Weber, the philosopher and pedagogist Friedrich Paulsen, and\nothers were influenced by Lange’s work (Jacobsen 1999, see also\nBraun 1881, Freimuth 1995). In fact, “Friedrich Paulsen, Paul\nNatorp, and Hans Vaihinger, all describe their reading of Lange as a\nconversion experience leading them into philosophy” (Hill 2003,\nKöhnke 1991, 211–213). \nFriedrich Albert Lange is a figure whose influence and thought remains\nto be judged accurately, especially in the Anglophone tradition. His\ninfluence as a teacher and as a mentor was as strong as were his more\npublic intellectual contributions. The positions Lange carved out were\nnot merely a response to nineteenth century intellectual movements\nincluding neo-Kantianism, materialism, Marxism, and Darwinism, though\nthey were regarded widely as effective responses. Lange conceived\nindependent and influential positions in logic, in national economy,\nin pedagogy, and in epistemology. He did so while pursuing a career as\nan activist and social organizer. His place in the history of\nphilosophy, of politics, and of science remains to be established by\nfuture scholarship.","contact.mail":"critique@vt.edu","contact.domain":"vt.edu"}]
