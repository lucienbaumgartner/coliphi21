Such\ndebates were shaped not only by academic inquiries but as questions\nabout the relation between women’s oppression and liberation and\nthe class politics of the left, trade union and feminist movements in\nthe late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly\nin the U.S., Britain and Europe. It will also be necessary to consider\nvarious philosophical approaches to the concept of work, the way that\nwomen’s work and household activities are subsumed or not under\nthis category, how the specific features of this work may or may not\nconnect to different “ways of knowing” and different\napproaches to ethics, and the debate between essentialist and social\nconstructionist approaches to differences between the sexes as a base\nfor the sexual division of labor in most known human societies.\n\n\nThe relation of women as a social group to the analysis of economic\nclass has spurred political debates within both Marxist and feminist\ncircles as to whether women’s movements challenging male\ndomination can assume a common set of women’s interests across\nrace, ethnicity, and class. If there are no such interests, on what\ncan a viable women’s movement be based, and how can it evade\npromoting primarily the interests of white middle class and wealthy\nwomen? To the extent to which women do organize themselves as a\npolitical group cutting across traditional class lines, under what\nconditions are they a conservative influence as opposed to a\nprogressive force for social change? If poor and working class\nwomen’s issues are different than middle and upper class\nwomen’s issues, how can middle class women’s movements be\ntrusted to address them? In addition to these questions, there is a\nset of issues related to cross-cultural comparative studies of women,\nwork and relative power in different societies, as well as analyses of\nhow women’s work is connected to processes of globalization.\n\n\nConsiderable research in the past 30 years has been devoted to women\nand work in the context of shifting divisions of labor globally\n(Ehrenreich and Hochschild 2004). Some of this feminist work proceeds\nfrom the development perspectives promoted by the UN and other policy\nmaking institutions (Chen et al. 2005), while other research takes a\nmore critical view (Beneria 2003; Pyle and Ward 2007). Many studies\naddress changes in the gender division of labor within specific\nnational economies (Freeman 1999; George 2005; Rofel; Sangster 1995)\nwhile others consider the impact of transnational migration on\nwomen’s class position (Pratt 2004; Romero 1992; Stephen 2007;\nKeogh 2015) and women’s opportunities for cross-class solidarity\nand grassroots-based organizing (Mohanty 2003). More recent feminist\nresearch has addressed the restructuring of work and its impact on\nwomen and gender culture as an effect of neo-liberal economic\nadjustments (Adkins 2002; Enloe 2004; Federici 2008; McRobbie 2002;\nSkeggs 2003).\n\nMarxism as a philosophy of human nature stresses the centrality of\nwork in the creation of human nature itself and human\nself-understanding (see the entry on\n Marxism).\n Both the changing historical relations between human work and nature,\nand the relations of humans to each other in the production and\ndistribution of goods to meet material needs construct human nature\ndifferently in different historical periods: nomadic humans are\ndifferent than agrarian or industrial humans. Marxism as a philosophy\nof history and social change highlights the social relations of work\nin different economic modes of production in its analysis of social\ninequalities and exploitation, including relations of domination such\nas racism and sexism. (Marx 1844, 1950, 1906–9; Marx and Engels 1848,\n1850; Engels 1942). Within capitalism, the system they most analyzed,\nthe logic of profit drives the bourgeois class into developing the\nproductive forces of land, labor and capital by expanding markets,\nturning land into a commodity and forcing the working classes from\nfeudal and independent agrarian production into wage labor. Marx and\nEngels argue that turning all labor into a commodity to be bought and\nsold not only alienates workers by taking the power of production away\nfrom them, it also collectivizes workers into factories and mass\nassembly lines. This provides the opportunity for workers to unite\nagainst the capitalists and to demand the collectivization of\nproperty, i.e., socialism, or communism. \nAccording to Engels’s famous analysis of women’s situation\nin the history of different economic modes production in The\nOrigin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1942),\nwomen are originally equal to, if not more powerful than, men in\ncommunal forms of production with matrilineal family organizations.\nWomen lose power when private property comes into existence as a mode\nof production. Men’s control of private property, and the\nability thereby to generate a surplus, changes the family form to a\npatriarchal one where women, and often slaves,\n [1]\n become the property of the father and husband. \nThe rise of capitalism, in separating the family household from\ncommodity production, further solidifies this control of men over\nwomen in the family when the latter become economic dependents of the\nformer in the male breadwinner-female housewife nuclear family form.\nImportantly, capitalism also creates the possibility of women’s\nliberation from family-based patriarchy by creating possibilities for\nwomen to work in wage labor and become economically independent of\nhusbands and fathers. Engels stresses, however, that because of the\nproblem of unpaid housework, a private task allocated to women in the\nsexual division of labor of capitalism, full women’s liberation\ncan only be achieved with the development of socialism and the\nsocialization of housework and childrearing in social services\nprovided by the state. For this reason, most contemporary Marxists\nhave argued that women’s liberation requires feminists to join\nthe working class struggle against capitalism (Cliff 1984).  \nMany Marxist-feminists thinkers, prominent among them sociologists and\nanthropologists, have done cross-cultural and historical studies of\nearlier forms of kinship and economy and the role of the sexual or\ngender division of labor in supporting or undermining women’s\nsocial power (cf. Reed 1973, Leacock 1972, Rosaldo and Lamphere 1974).\nThey have also attempted to assess the world economic development of\ncapitalism as a contradictory force for the liberation of women\n(Federici 2004; Mies 1986; Saffioti 1978) and to argue that universal\nwomen’s liberation requires attention to the worse off: poor\nwomen workers in poor post-colonial countries (Sen & Grown 1987).\nOther feminist anthropologists have argued that other variables in\naddition to women’s role in production are key to understanding\nwomen’s social status and power (Sanday 1981; Leghorn and Parker\n1981). Yet other feminist economic historians have done historical\nstudies of the ways that race, class and ethnicity have situated women\ndifferently in relation to production, for example in the history of\nthe United States (Davis 1983; Amott and Matthaei 1991). Finally some\nMarxist-feminists have argued that women’s work in biological\nand social reproduction is a necessary element of all modes of\nproduction and one often ignored by Marxist economists (Benston 1969;\nHennessy 2003; Vogel 1995). \nThose feminist analyses which have highlighted the role of\nwomen’s work in the social construction of gender and the\nperpetuation of male dominance have been termed liberal, radical,\nMarxist, and socialist feminism by such influential categorizers as\nJaggar and Rothenberg [Struhl] (1978), Tong (2000), Barrett (1980),\nJaggar (1983) and Walby\n (1990)[2].\n However, the pigeonhole categories of liberal, radical, Marxist, or\nsocialist categories apply poorly to both to first wave women’s\nmovement feminist predecessors and contemporary deconstructionist,\npost-structuralist and post-colonialist perspectives. \nA number of first wave feminists write about work and class as key\nissues for women’s liberation, such as socialist-feminist\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, heavily influenced by Darwinism and\n19th century utopian modernism (Gilman 1898, 1910, 1979),\nanarchist Emma Goldman (1969), and existentialist, radical feminist\nand Marxist of sorts Simone de Beauvoir (1952). This is because the\ndebates that arose around the place of the women’s movement in\nclass politics were different in the early and mid-twentieth century\nthan they were in the 1960s when many feminist theorists were trying\nto define themselves independently of the left anti-Vietnam war and\ncivil rights movements of the time. \nThe debate about the economic and social function of housework and its\nrelation to women’s oppression is an old one that has been a\nfeature of both the first and second wave women’s movements in\nthe US, Britain and Europe. In both eras, the underlying issue is how\nto handle the public/private split of capitalist societies in which\nwomen’s reproductive functions have either limited their work to\nthe home or created a “second shift” problem of unpaid\nhousework and childcare as well as waged work. In the first wave,\nlocated as it was in the Victorian period where the dominant ideology\nfor middle and upper class women was purity, piety and domesticity\n(also called the “cult of true womanhood”), the debate\ncentered on whether to keep housework in the private sphere yet make\nit more scientific and efficient (Beecher 1841; Richards 1915 ), or\nwhether to “socialize” it by bringing it into the public\nsphere, as socialist Charlotte Perkins Gilman advocated (1898). \nIn the US, the “public housekeeping” aspect of the\nProgressive movement of the 1890s through early 1900s advocated that\nwomen bring the positive values associated with motherhood into the\npublic sphere — by obtaining the vote, cleaning out corruption\nin politics, creating settlement houses to educate and support\nimmigrants, and forming the women’s peace movement, etc. (cf.\nJane Addams 1914). Disagreements about whether to downplay or valorize\nthe distinctive function and skills in motherhood as work for which\nwomen are naturally superior, or to see motherhood as restricting\nwomen’s chances for economic independence and equality with men\nin the public sphere, were also evident in debates between Ellen Keys\n(1909, 1914) and Gilman. Keys represented the difference side, that\nwomen are superior humans because of mothering; while Gilman and\nGoldman took the equality side of the debate, that is, that, women are\nrestricted, and made socially unequal to men, by unpaid housework and\n mothering[3]. \nIn the second wave movement, theorists can be grouped by their theory\nof how housework oppresses women. Typically, liberal feminists\ncritique housework because it is unpaid. This makes women dependent on\nmen and devalued, since their work is outside the meaningful sphere of\npublic economic production (Friedan 1963). Marxist feminist theorists\nsee this as part of the problem, but some go further to maintain that\nhousework is part of a household feudal mode of production of goods\nfor use that persists under capitalism and gives men feudal powers\nover women’s work (Benston 1969, Fox 1980). Other Marxist\nfeminists argue that women’s housework is part of the social\nreproduction of capitalism (Federici 1975, 2004; Malos 1975; Vogel\n1995). That the necessary work of reproducing the working class is\nunpaid allows more profits to capitalists. It is the sexual division\nof labor in productive and reproductive work that makes woman unequal\nto men and allows capitalists to exploit women’s unpaid labor.\nSome even make this analysis the basis for a demand for wages for\nhousework (Dalla Costa 1974; Federici 1975). More recently, Federici\nhas done an analysis of the transition to capitalism in Europe. She\nargues that it was the emerging capitalist class need to control\nworking class reproduction, to eliminate working class women’s\ncontrol over biological reproduction, and to assure their unpaid\nreproductive work in the home by restricting abortions, that fueled\nthe campaign against witches during this period (Federici 2004). \nOne of the philosophical problems raised by the housework debate is\nhow to draw the line between work and play or leisure activity when\nthe activity is not paid: is a mother playing with her baby working or\nengaged in play? If the former, then her hours in such activity may be\ncompared with those of her husband or partner to see if there is an\nexploitation relation present, for example, if his total hours of\nproductive and reproductive work for the family are less than hers\n(cf. Delphy 1984). But to the extent that childrearing counts as\nleisure activity, as play, as activity held to be intrinsically\nvaluable (Ferguson 2004), no exploitation is involved. Perhaps\nchildrearing and other caring activity is both work and play, but only\nthat portion which is necessary for the psychological growth of the\nchild and the worker(s) counts as work. If so, who determines when\nthat line is crossed? Since non-market activity does not have a clear\ncriterion to distinguish work from non-work, nor necessary from\nnon-necessary social labor, an arbitrary element seems to creep in\nthat makes standards of fairness difficult to apply to gendered\nhousehold bargains between men and women dividing up waged and\nnon-waged work. (Barrett 1980). \nOne solution to this problem is simply to take all household activity\nthat could also be done by waged labor (nannies, domestic servants,\ngardeners, chauffeurs, etc.) as work and to figure its comparable\nworth by the waged labor necessary to replace it (Folbre 1982, 1983).\nAnother is to reject altogether the attempts to base women’s\noppression on social relations of work, on the grounds that such\ntheories are overly generalizing and ignore the discrete meanings that\nkinship activities have for women in different contexts (Nicholson\n1991; Fraser and Nicholson 1991; Marchand 1995). Or, one can argue\nthat although the line between work and leisure changes historically,\nthose doing the activity should have the decisive say as to whether\ntheir activity counts as work, i.e., labor necessary to promote human\nwelfare. The existence of second wave women’s movements\ncritiques of the “second shift” of unpaid household\nactivity indicates that a growing number of women see most of it as\nwork, not play (cf. Hochchild 1989). Finally, one can argue that since\nthe human care involved in taking care of children and elders creates\na public good, it should clearly be characterized as work, and those\nwho are caretakers, primarily women, should be fairly compensated for\nit by society or the state (Ferguson and Folbre 2000: Folbre 2000,\nFerguson 2004). \nLiberal, Marxist and radical feminists have all characterized women as\ndoubly alienated in capitalism because of the public/private split\nthat relegates their work as mothers and houseworkers to the home, and\npsychologically denies them full personhood, citizenship and human\nrights (Foreman 1974, Okin 1989, Pateman 1988, Goldman 1969). Noting\nthat women workers on average only have about 70% of the average\nsalary of men in the contemporary U.S., feminists have claimed this is\nbecause women’s work, tied stereotypically to housework and\nhence thought unskilled is undervalued, whether it is cleaning or rote\nservice work, or nurturing work thought to be connected to natural\nmaternal motivations and aptitudes. Hence some feminists have\norganized in campaigns for “comparable worth” to raise\nwomen’s wages to the same as men’s wages involving\ncomparable skills (Brenner 2000; cf. also articles in Hansen and\nPhilipson eds. 1990). \nMany radical feminists maintain that women’s work is part of a\nseparate patriarchal mode of reproduction that underlies all economic\nsystems of production and in which men exploit women’s\nreproductive labor (Delphy 1984; O’Brien 1981; Leghorn and\nParker 1981; Rich 1980; Mies 1986). Smith (1974), O’Brien\n(1981), Hartsock (1983 a,b), Haraway (1985) and Harding (1986)\npioneered in combining this radical feminist assumption with a\nperspectival Marxist theory of knowledge to argue that one’s\nrelation to the work of production and reproduction gave each gender\nand each social class a different way of knowing the social totality.\nWomen’s work, they argued, ties them to nature and human needs\nin a different way than men’s work does, which creates the\npossibility of a less alienated and more comprehensive understanding\nof the workings of the social totality. Patricia Hill Collins argues\nfurther that the racial division of labor, institutional racism and\ndifferent family structures put African American women in yet a\ndifferent epistemic relation to society than white and other women\n(1990, 2000). Writing in a post-modernist re-articulation of this\nfeminist standpoint theory, Donna Haraway argues that the breakdown of\nthe nature/culture distinction because of scientific technology and\nits alteration of the human body makes us into “cyborgs”.\nHence our perspectives are so intersectional that they cannot be\nunified simply by a common relation to work. What is required for a\nfeminist politics is not a situated identity politics, whether of\ngender and/or race and/or class, but an affinity politics based on\nalliances and coalitions that combine epistemic perspectives (Haraway\n1985). \nLike these radical feminists, some socialist-feminists have tried to\ndevelop a “dual systems” theory (cf. Young 1981). This\ninvolves theorizing a separate system of work relations that organizes\nand directs human sexuality, nurturance, affection and biological\nreproduction. Rather than seeing this as an unchanging universal base\nfor patriarchy, however, they have argued that this system, thought of\nas the “sex/gender system” (Rubin 1975; Hartmann 1978,\n1981a,b), or as “sex/affective production” (Ferguson 1989,\n1991; Ferguson and Folbre 1981) has different historical modes, just\nas Marx argued that economies do. Rubin argues that sex/gender systems\nhave been based in different kinship arrangements, most of which have\nsupported the exchange of women by men in marriage, and hence have\nsupported male domination and compulsory heterosexuality. She is\nhopeful that since capitalism shifted the organization of the economy\nfrom kinship to commodity production, the power of fathers and\nhusbands over daughters and wives, and the ability to enforce\nheterosexuality, will continue to decline, and women’s\nincreasing ability to be economically independent will lead to\nwomen’s liberation and equality with men. \nWith a different historical twist, Hartmann argues that a historical\nbargain was cemented between capitalist and working class male\npatriarchs to shore up patriarchal privileges that were being weakened\nby the entrance of women into wage labor in the 19th\ncentury by the creation of the “family wage” to allow men\nsufficient wages to support a non-wage-earning wife and children at\nhome (1981a). While Ferguson and Folbre (1981) agree that there is no\ninevitable fit between capitalism and patriarchy, they argue that\nthere are conflicts, and that the family wage bargain has broken down\nat present. Indeed, both Ferguson and Smart (1984) argue that welfare\nstate capitalism and the persistent sexual division of wage labor in\nwhich work coded as women’s is paid less than men’s with\nless job security are ways that a “public patriarchy” has\nreplaced different systems of family patriarchy that were operating in\nearly and pre-capitalist societies. Walby (1990) has a similar\nanalysis, but to her the connection between forms of capitalism and\nforms of patriarchy is more functional and less accidental than it\nappears to Ferguson and Smart. \nWalby argues that there are two different basic forms of patriarchy\nwhich emerge in response to the tensions between capitalist economies\nand patriarchal household economies: private and public patriarchy.\nPrivate patriarchy as a form is marked by excluding women from\neconomic and political power while public patriarchy works by\nsegregating women. There is a semi-automatic re-adjustment of the dual\nsystems when the older private father patriarchy based on the\npatriarchal family is broken down due to the pressures of early\nindustrial capitalism. The family wage and women’s second class\ncitizenship that marked that initial re-adjustment are then\nfunctionally replaced by a public form of patriarchy, the patriarchal\nwelfare state, where women enter the wage labor force permanently but\nin segregated less well paid jobs. But Ferguson (1989,1991), Smart\n(1984) and Folbre (1994) suggest that although the patriarchal control\nof fathers and husbands over wife and children as economic assets has\nbeen diminished in advanced capitalism, there is always a dialectical\nand contradictory tension between patriarchy and capitalism in which\nboth advances and retreats for women’s equality as citizens and\nin work relations are constantly occurring in the new form of public\npatriarchy. Thus, the new “marriage” of patriarchal\ncapitalism operates to relegate women to unpaid or lesser paid caring\nlabor, whether in the household or in wage labor, thus keeping women\nby and large unequal to men. This is especially notable in the rise of\npoor single-mother-headed families. However, as it forces more and\nmore women into wage labor, women are given opportunities for some\nindependence from men and the possibility to challenge male dominance\nand sex segregation in all spheres of social life. Examples are the\nrise of the first and second wave women’s movements and\nconsequent gains in civil rights for women. \nThe work of feminist sociologist Dorothy Smith (1989) has been a\nnotable intervention into the public-private split by bringing into\nview the institutions and power regimes that regulate the everyday\nworld, their gender subtext, and basis in a gendered division of\nlabor. Legal feminist critics expand on the biopolitics of the\npatriarchal welfare state, which psychiatrizes as it threatens mothers\nwith the loss of child custody. This represents a new eugenics twist\non the enduring mistrust of working-class mothers and casting those\nwho are imprisoned as undeserving parent (Guggenheim 2007; Law 2012).\nAfrican American mothers bear the brunt of punitive and racist family\nand criminal law (Thompson 2010; Solinger et al. 2010). \nThe socialist-feminist idea that there are two interlocking systems\nthat structure gender and the economy, and thus are jointly\nresponsible for male domination, has been developed in a psychological\ndirection by the psychoanalytic school of feminist theorists.\nParticularly relevant to the question of women and work are the\ntheories of Mitchell (1972, 1974), Kuhn and Wolpe (1978), Chodorow\n(1978, 1979, 1982) and Ruddick (1989). Mothering, or, taking care of\nbabies and small children, as a type of work done overwhelmingly by\nwomen, socializes women and men to have different identities,\npersonalities and skills. In her first work (1972), Mitchell argues\nthat women’s different relations to productive work,\nreproduction, socialization of children and sexuality in patriarchy\ngive her lesser economic and psychological power in relation to men.\nIn a Freudian vein, Mitchell later argues (1974) that women learn that\nthey are not full symbolic subjects because compulsory heterosexuality\nand the incest taboo bar them from meeting either the desire of their\nmother or any other woman. Chodorow, also reading Freud from a\nfeminist perspective, suggests that women’s predominance in\nmothering work is the basis for the learned gender distinction between\nwomen and men. The sexual division of infant care gives boys, who must\nlearn their masculine identity by separating from their mother and the\nfeminine, a motive for deprecating, as well as dominating, women.\nRuddick from a more Aristotelian perspective suggests that it is the\nskills and virtues required in the practice of mothering work which\nnot only socially construct feminine gender differently from\nmen’s, but could ground an alternative vision for peace and\nresolving human conflicts, if a peace movement were led by women. \nFerguson argues that the “sex/affective” work of mothering\nand wifely nurturing is exploitative of women: women give more\nnurturance and satisfaction (including sexual satisfaction) to men and\nchildren than they receive, and do much more of the work of providing\nthese important human goods (cf. also Bartky 1990). The gendered\ndivision of labor has both economic and psychological consequences,\nsince women’s caring labor creates women less capable of or\nmotivated to separate from others, and hence less likely to protest\nsuch gender exploitation (Ferguson 1989, 1991). Folbre argues by\ncontrast that it is only because women’s bargaining power is\nless than men’s because of the power relations involved in the\ngender division of labor and property that women acquiesce to such\ninequalities (Folbre 1982). Ferguson argues that gendered exploitation\nin a system of meeting human needs suggests that women can be seen as\na “sex class” (or gender class) which cuts across economic\nclass lines (1979, 1989, 1991). This line of thought is also developed\nby Christine Delphy (1984), Monique Wittig (1980) and Luce Irigaray\n(1975). \nOn the other side of the debate, Brenner (2000) argues that women are\nnot uniformly exploited by men across economic class lines: indeed,\nfor working class women their unpaid work as housewives serves the\nworking class as a whole, because the whole class benefits when its\ndaily and future reproduction needs are met by women’s nurturing\nand childcare work. They argue further that middle and upper class\nwomen’s economic privileges will inevitably lead them to betray\nworking class women in any cross-class alliance that is not explicitly\nanti-capitalist. Hochschild (2000) and hooks (2000) point out that\ncareer women tend to pay working class women to do the second shift\nwork in the home so they can avoid that extra work, and they have an\ninterest in keeping such wages, e.g., for house cleaning and nannies,\nas low as possible to keep the surplus for themselves. Kollias (1981)\nargues further that working class women are in a stronger political\nposition to work effectively for women’s liberation than middle\nclass women, while McKenny (1981) argues that professional women have\nto overcome myths of professionalism that keep them feeling superior\nto working class women and hence unable to learn from or work with\nthem for social change. \nSeveral authors have explored the ethical implications of the sexual\ndivision of labor in which it is primarily women who do caring labor.\nNancy Fraser (1997) and Susan Moller Okin (1989) formulate ethical\narguments to maintain that a just model of society would have to\nre-structure work relations so that the unpaid and underpaid caring\nlabor now done primarily by women would be given a status equivalent\nto (other) wage labor by various means. In her council socialist\nvision, Ferguson (1989, 1991) argues that an ideal society would\nrequire both women and men to do the hitherto private unpaid work of\ncaring or “sex/affective labor.” For example, such work\nwould be shared by men, either in the family and/or provided by the\nstate where appropriate (as for elders and children’s\nchildcare), and compensated fairly by family allowances (for those,\nwomen or men, doing the major share of housework), and by higher pay\nfor caring wage work (such as daycare workers, nurses, and\nteachers). \nCarol Gilligan (1982) claims that women and girls tend to use a\ndifferent form of ethical reasoning — she terms this the\n“ethics of care” — than men and boys who use an\nethics of justice. Some have argued that this different ethical\napproach is due to women’s caring sensibilities that have been\ndeveloped by the sexual division of labor (Ruddick 1989).\nInterestingly, the debate between feminist theorists of justice, e.g.,\nFraser and Okin, and ethics of care feminists such as Gilligan and\nRuddick, is less about substance than a meta-ethical disbute as to\nwhether ethics should concern principles or judgments in particular\ncases. All of these theorists seem to have ideal visions of society\nwhich dovetail: all would support the elimination of the sexual\ndivision of labor so that both men and women could become equally\nsensitized to particular others through caring work. \nUseful anthologies of the first stage of second wave socialist\nfeminist writings which include discussions of women, class and work\nfrom psychological as well as sociological and economic perspectives\nare Eisenstein (1979), Hansen and Philipson (1990), Hennessy and\nIngraham (1997), and Holmstrom (2002). Jaggar (1983) wrote perhaps the\nfirst philosophy text explaining the categories of liberal, radical,\nMarxist and socialist-feminist thought and defending a\nsocialist-feminist theory of male domination based on the notion of\nwomen’s alienated labor. Others such as Jaggar and Rothenberg\n(1978), Tuana and Tong (1995) and Herrmann and Stewart (1993) include\nclassic socialist feminist analyses in their collections, inviting\ncomparisons of the authors to others grouped under the categories of\nliberal, radical, psychoanalytic, Marxist, postmodern, postcolonial\nand multicultural feminisms. \nVarious post-modern critiques of these earlier feminist schools of\nthought such as post-colonialism as well as deconstruction and\npost-structuralism challenge the over-generalizations and economic\nreductionism of many of those constructing feminist theories that fall\nunder the early categories of liberal, radical, Marxist or socialist\nfeminism (cf. Grewal and Kaplan 1992; Kaplan et al. 1999; Nicholson\n1991; Fraser and Nicholson 1991; hooks 1984, 2000; Anzaldúa and\nMoraga 1981; Sandoval 2000). Others argue that part of the problem is\nthe master narratives of liberalism or Marxism, the first of which\nsees all domination relations due to traditional hierarchies and\nundermined by capitalism, thus ignoring the independent effectivity of\nracism (Josephs 1981); and the second of which ties all domination\nrelations to the structure of contemporary capitalism and ignores the\nnon-capitalist economics contexts in which many women work, even\nwithin so-called capitalist economies, such as housework and voluntary\ncommunity work (Gibson-Graham 1996). \nIn spite of the “pomo” critiques, there are some powerful\nthinkers within this tendency who have not completely rejected a more\ngeneral starting point of analysis based on women, class and work. For\nexample, Spivak (1988), Mohanty (1997), Carby (1997), and Hennessy\n(1993, 2000) are creating and re-articulating forms of Marxist and\nsocialist-feminism less susceptible to charges of over-generalization\nand reductionism, and more compatible with close contextual analysis\nof the power relations of gender and class as they relate to work.\nThey can be grouped loosely with a tendency called materialist\nfeminism that incorporates some of the methods of deconstruction and\npost-structuralism (Hennessy 1993; Landry and MacLean 1993). \nMany in the contemporary feminist theory debate are interested in\ndeveloping concrete “intersectional” or “integrative\nfeminist” analyses of particular issues which try to give equal\nweight to gender, race, class and sexuality in a global context\nwithout defining themselves by the categories, such as liberal,\nradical or materialist, of the earlier feminist debate categories (cf.\nwork by Davis 1983; Brewer 1995; Crenshaw 1997; Stanlie and James\n1997; Anzaldúa 1999; hooks 1984, 2000). Nonetheless strong\nemphasis on issues of race and ethnicity can be found in their work on\nwomen, class and work. For example, Brewer shows that white and\nAfrican-American working class women are divided by race in the\nworkforce, and that even changes in the occupational structure\nhistorically tend to maintain this racial division of labor. Hooks\nargues that women of color and some radical feminists were more\nsensitive to class and race issues than those, primarily white,\nfeminists whom she labels “reformist feminists” (hooks\n2000). \nPresupposed in the general theoretical debates concerning the\nrelations between gender, social and economic class, and work are\nusually definitions of each of these categories that some thinkers\nwould argue are problematic. For example, Tokarczyk and Fay have an\nexcellent anthology on working class women in the academy (1993) in\nwhich various contributors discuss the ambiguous positions in which\nthey find themselves by coming from poor family backgrounds and\nbecoming academics. One problem is whether they are still members of\nthe working class in so doing, and if not, whether they are betraying\ntheir families of origin by a rise to middle class status. Another is,\nwhether they have the same status in the academy, as workers, thinkers\nand women, as those men or women whose families of origin were middle\nclass or above. Rita Mae Brown wrote an early article on this, arguing\nthat education and academic status did not automatically change a\nworking class woman’s identity, which is based not just on\none’s relation to production, but one’s behavior, basic\nassumptions about life, and experiences in childhood (Brown 1974).\nJoanna Kadi (1999) describes herself as cultural worker who tackles\nelitism in the white academy, including in women’s studies\ncourses. Tokarczyk and Fay acknowledge that the definition of\n“class” is vague in the U.S. Rather than provide a\nstandard philosophical definition in terms of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for membership in the working class, they provide a cluster\nof characteristics and examples of jobs, such as physically demanding,\nrepetitive and dangerous jobs, jobs that lack autonomy and are\ngenerally paid badly. Examples of working class jobs they give are\ncleaning women, waitresses, lumberjacks, janitors and police officers.\nThey then define their term “working class women\nacademics” to include women whose parents had jobs such as these\nand are in the first generation in their family to attend college\n(Tokarczyk and Fay, 5). They challenge those that would argue that\nfamily origin can be overcome by the present position one has in the\nsocial division of labor: simply performing a professional job and\nearning a salary does not eradicate the class identity formed in\none’s “family class” (cf. Ferguson 1979). \nMore recent work in socio-legal studies also has begun to question the\nlimits of intersectional analysis (Grabham et al. 2009). It\nacknowledges the importance of intersectionality, a term coined by law\nprofessor Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989) to shed light on epistemic\ninjustice done to Black women in anti-discrimination law. Yet, despite\nits merit for overcoming the dual system’s theoretical impasse,\nJoanna Conaghan also critiques the essentializing tendencies of\nintersectional analysis which succeeds mainly dealing with race and\ngender oppression at an individual level, but it has little to offer\nto remedy structural injustice. Furthermore, because such method is\nidentity-focused it will not get at the dimension of class which has\nbeen traditionally thought in relational not locational terms (2008,\n29–30).  \nTo theorize the problematic relation of women to social class,\nFerguson (1979, 1989, 1991) argues that there are at least three\ndifferent variables — an individual’s work, family of\norigin, and present household economic unit — which relate an\nindividual to a specific socio-economic class. For example, a woman\nmay work on two levels: as a day care worker (working class), but also\nas a member of a household where she does the housework and\nmothering/child care, while her husband is a wealthy contractor (petit\nbourgeois, small capitalist class). If in addition her family of\norigin is professional middle class (because, say, her parents were\ncollege educated academics), the woman may be seen and see herself as\neither working class or middle class, depending on whether she and\nothers emphasize her present relations of wage work (her individual\neconomic class, which in this case is working class), her household\nincome (middle class) or her family of origin (middle class). \nSylvia Walby deals with this ambiguity of economic class as applying\nto women as unpaid houseworkers by claiming against Delphy (1984) that\nthe relevant economic sex classes are those who are housewives vs.\nthose who are husbands benefiting from such work, not those of\nall women and men, whether or not they do or receive\nhousework services (Walby 1990). Ferguson, however, sides with Delphy\nin putting all women into “sex class”, since all women,\nsince trained into the gender roles of patriarchal wife and\nmotherhood, are potentially those whose unpaid housework can be so\nexploited. But seeing herself as a member of a fourth class category,\n“sex class,” and hence, in a patriarchal capitalist\nsystem, seeing herself exploited as a woman worker in her wage work\nand unpaid second shift housework,\n [4]\n is thus not a given but an achieved social identity. Such an identity\nis usually formed through political organizing and coalitions with\nother women at her place of employment, in her home and her community.\nIn this sense the concept of sex class is exactly analogous to the\nconcept of a feminist epistemological standpoint: not a given identity\nor perspective, but one that is achievable under the right\nconditions. \nRealizing the importance of this disjuncture between economic class\nand sex class for women, Maxine Molyneux (1984) argues in a often\ncited article that there are no “women’s interests”\nin the abstract that can unify women in political struggle. Instead,\nshe theorizes that women have both “practical gender\ninterests” and “strategic gender interests.”\nPractical gender interests are those that women develop because of the\nsexual division of labor, which makes them responsible for the\nnurturant work of sustaining the physical and psychological well-being\nof children, partners and relatives through caring labor. Such\npractical gender interests, because they tie a woman’s\nconception of her own interests as a woman to those of her family,\nsupport women’s popular movements for food, water, child and\nhealth care, even defense against state violence, which ally them with\nthe economic class interests of their family. Strategic gender\ninterests, on the contrary, may ally women across otherwise divided\neconomic class interests, since they are those, like rights against\nphysical male violence and reproductive rights, which women have as a\nsex class to eliminate male domination. \nMolyneux used her distinctions between practical and strategic gender\ninterests to distinguish between the popular women’s movement in\nNicaragua based on demands for economic justice for workers and\nfarmers against the owning classes, demands such as education, health\nand maternity care, clean water, food and housing, and the feminist\nmovement which emphasized the fight for legal abortion, fathers’\nobligation to pay child support to single mothers, and rights against\nrape and domestic violence. She and others have used this distinction\nbetween practical and strategic gender interests to characterize the\ntension between popular women’s movements and feminist movements\nin Latin America (Molyneux 2001; Alvarez 1998; Foweraker 1998). \nA similar distinction between different types of women’s\ninterests was developed further as a critique of interest group\nparadigms of politics by Anna Jónasdóttir (1988, 1994).\nJónasdóttir argues that women have a common formal\ninterest in votes for women, women’s political caucuses, gender\nparity demands, and other mechanisms which allow women a way to\ndevelop a collective political voice, even though their content\ninterests, that is, their specific needs and priorities, may vary by\nrace and economic class, among others. Her distinctions, and those of\nMolyneux, have been changed slightly — practical vs. strategic\ngender needs, rather than interests — to compare and contrast\ndifferent paradigms of economic development by World Bank feminist\ntheorist Carolyn Moser (1993). Most recently the\nJónasdóttir distinctions have been used by Mohanty\n(1997) to defend and maintain, in spite of postmodernists’\nemphasis on intersectional differences, that commonalities in\nwomen’s gendered work can create a cross-class base for\ndemanding a collective political voice for women: a transnational\nfeminism which creates a demand for women’s political\nrepresentation, developing the platform of women’s human rights\nas women and as workers. Nonetheless, the tension between\nwomen’s economic class-based interests or needs and their\nvisionary/strategic gender interests or needs is still always present,\nand must therefore always be negotiated concretely by popular\nmovements for social justice involving women’s issues. \nAnother approach to the problematic nature of socio-economic class as\nit relates to women are empirical studies which show how class\ndistinctions are still important for women in their daily lives as a\nway to compare and contrast themselves with other women and men, even\nif they do not use the concepts of “working class,”\n“professional class” or “capitalist class”.\nMany have pointed out that the concept of class itself is mystified in\nthe U.S. context, but that nonetheless class distinctions still\noperate because of different structural economic constraints, which\nact on some differently from others. The Ehrenreichs (1979), in a\nclassic article, argue that this mystification is due to the emergence\nof a professional-managerial class that has some interests in common\nwith the capitalist class and some with the working class. Whatever\nits causes, there are empirical studies which show that class\ndistinctions still operate between women, albeit in an indirect way.\nBarbara Ehrenreich (2001), by adopting the material life conditions of\na poor woman, did an empirical study of the lives of women working for\nminimum wages and found their issues to be quite different from and\nignored by middle and upper-class women. Diane Reay (2004) does an\nempirical study of women from manual labor family backgrounds and\ntheir relation to the schooling of their children, and discovers that\nthey use a discourse that acknowledges class differences of\neducational access and career possibilities, even though it does not\nspecifically define these by class per se. Similarly, Julie Bettie\n(2000) does an impressive discourse analysis of the way that Latina\nhigh school students create their own class distinctions through\nconcepts such as “chicas,” “cholas” and\n“trash” to refer to themselves and their peers. These\ncategories pick out girls as having middle class, working class or\npoor aspirations by performance indicators such as dress, speech,\nterritorial hang-outs and school achievement, while never mentioning\n“class” by name. Women’s experiences of growing up\nworking class are presented in the anthology edited by Tea (2003). \nSo far, it has been assumed that work is an intrinsic good. \nWhat if waged or unwaged work itself were to be considered problematic\nor oppressive? Autonomous Marxists contest that liberal or socialist\nfeminist perspectives have unnecessarily mystified work and have\noperated with a moralism. Autonomists are associated with the\nOperaismo, post-Operaismo and Autonomia movements, the Midnight Notes\nCollective, Zerowork, Lotta Feminista, and the Wages for Housework\nmovement (Weeks 2011, 241). Whether one ought to be paid for housework\nor reproductive labor or seek equal employment opportunities,\nfeminists have not sufficiently opposed the sanctification of work.\nChampioning the refusal of work means to abandon a narrow focus on the\ncritique of the extraction of surplus value or of the process of\ndeskilling. Furthermore, it is imperative to interrogate how work\ndominates our lives (Weeks 2011, 13). Kathi Weeks charges that a\nproductivist bias is common to feminist and Marxist analysis. The\ncredo of autonomists then is liberation from work, in\ncontradistinction to Marxist humanists such as Erich Fromm’s\nadvocacy for liberation of work. \nThe Wages for Housework campaign demanded purposefully the impossible.\nThese feminists did not only ask for compensation for unpaid domestic\nlabor, but also postulated the end of such work (Federici 1995).\nPost-work also means post-domestic care, something that gets lost in\nsome of the ethic of care analysis, which inadvertently fosters a\nromantic attachment to endowing meaning to such work. Furthermore,\npost-work also appeals to carving out space for “queer\ntime” and queer resistant agency (Halberstam 2005, Lehr 1999),\nan appeal to unscripted life. A wholesale critique of housework is not\neasily understood; even Arlie Hochschild’s (1997) own analysis\nof her ethnographic studies of diverse family practices comes to the\nconclusion that authentic housework should be sanctified and set apart\nfrom mere alienating factory production (Weeks 2011, 157–59). \nA post-work ethic entails a playful commitment to leisure and\nunstructured activities such as day-dreaming. Joseph Trullinger (2016)\nextends Kathi Weeks’ analysis by drawing on Marcuse’s\nconcept of great refusal and playful labor defying commodity fetishism\nand productivism. By ignoring the liberatory power of play, Weeks\ninsufficiently engages the meaning of work and the asceticism of the\nwork ethic (Trullinger 2016, 469). Still, the danger of play morphing\ninto (unpaid) labor is real, as evinced by social media corporate\ngiant FaceBook exploiting play-labor for capitalist gains (Fuchs 2016)\nand a veritable corporate feminism may ask us to “lean in”\n(Sandberg 2013) rather than “lean out”. \nWhile it is reasonable to champion daydreams and play as intrinsic\ngoods, idle time itself is often not felt as a good or luxury, but\ninstead a psychic imposition. This is why one speaks of “doing\ntime,” when one is sentenced to a prison term or worse, to death\nrow (Moses 2007). Imprisonment is anathema to indigenous,\nsocio-centric peoples in the Global South, and imprisonment is closely\nconnected to the disciplinary apparatus of western colonization of the\nAmericas and Africa (Nagel 2007). The birth of the western modern\nprison focused on self-discipline, known as the “separate\nsystem” of Philadelphia, PA, leading to enforced isolation and\nseparate celling. Day-dreaming in a solitary cell becomes positively\ndangerous and suicides and mental illness increase exponentially\n(Casella et al. 2016). Idle time is thus countered by another\nprison regime, the Auburn, NY, factory system, also known as the\n“silent system,” where prisoners worked in a factory, but\nthey were forbidden to talk with each other. Under the notorious\nSouthern US convict lease system, representing the shift “from\nthe prison of slavery to the slavery of prisons” (Davis 1998),\nBlack female and male prisoners are toiling in chain gangs, a visceral\nreminder of the trauma of chattel slavery. \nAnother haunting reminder of chattel slavery is the neoliberal welfare\nstate’s intrusion in the family, charging parents with poor work\nethic and neglect of their children. In the US, poor children of\ncolor, especially Black, Latino, and American Indians living on\nreservations, are at higher risk of being taken away from their kin\nand carers and turned over to the foster care system (Goldberg 2015).\nThe world over, parents who are socially displaced such as Romanian\nimmigrants in Norway, are under greater scrutiny by state actors,\ne.g., child protective services. In the US, social workers’ own\nwhite middle class (protestant) work ideology is enforced\nparadoxically on grieving mothers: these stigmatized women are\nsummoned to complete parenting skills courses, cooking courses, etc.,\nand are thus effectively forced out of a paid job, made dependent on\nthe good will of the social worker and family court judge, who may\ngrant access to child-supervised visits. Thus, parents charged with\nchild abuse and/or neglect are thus unable to pursue education or a\njob, often creating an intergenerational cycle of the violence of\npoverty. In ideological terms, this is coded as welfare dependency and\nracialized as a controlling image, thus stereotyping young Black\nmothers (Fraser and Gordon 1994; Hill Collins 1990, 2000). In\nresponse, the National Welfare Rights Organization was created to\ndestigmatize welfare by postulating it as a human right (Toney 2000)\nand by also demanding a basic income, as alternative to punitive\nwelfare (Weeks 2011, 138). The proposal for basic income has gained\ntraction in recent years, cumulating in a Swiss referendum, even\nthough it was defeated in 2016. Migrant workers, worker-mothers who\nserve as domestic workers are also at risk (of deportation and/or\nimprisonment) for facing frivolous neglect charges or simply for\nlacking proper visa status. Gendered moral economies operate across\nnational, racial and geographic borders in enforcing a domestic and\ndomesticating patriarchal ideology and determining who is a good\nvictim and deserves to be rescued (Keogh 2015; Nagel 2011;\nGutiérrez Rodríguez 2010; Grewal and Kaplan 1992;\nKaplan et al. 1999).  \nStigmatized work such as erotic labor or sex work has divided\nfeminists into two camps: those who support sex workers’ rights\nto organize and seek labor law protection and those who call\nthemselves abolitionists but actually advocate a prohibitionist\napproach of “trafficking in women” that serves to rescue\ngirls and women from such degrading, dangerous punishment (Nagel\n2015). Some sex worker rights approaches focus on eschewing the\nmoralizing rallying cry of choice versus coercion and seek to\ndestigmatize such labor and offer a postcolonial critique of\nprohibitionist ideology (Kempadoo and Doezema 1995). Others also focus\non the lived experiences and agencies of such workers and\ncontextualize their lives within structural constraints of the\nfeminization of poverty (Dewey 2010; Zheng 2009). Paradoxically, by\nfocusing narrowly on income-generating activities, Dewey (2010)\ncontents that such advocates actually reinscribe stigmatization. And\nsome sex workers’ rights organizations such as COYOTE\n(“Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics”) also inadvertently\nendorse a traditional work-ethic ideology by appealing to a moralizing\ndiscourse of respectability (Weeks 2011, pp. 67–68). \nTheoretical and empirical debates about the relation of women to class\nand work, and the implications of these relations for theories of male\ndomination and women’s oppression as well as for other systems\nof social domination, continue to be important sources of theories and\ninvestigations of gender identities, roles and powers in the field of\nwomen and gender studies, as well as in history, sociology,\nanthropology and economics. They also have important implications for\nepistemology, metaphysics and political theory in the discipline of\nphilosophy, and consequently other disciplines in humanities and the\nsocial sciences.","contact.mail":"Mecke.Nagel@cortland.edu","contact.domain":"cortland.edu"}]
