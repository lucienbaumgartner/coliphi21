Gold","entry":"vasubandhu","body.text":"\n\n\nThe Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (4th to 5th\ncentury C.E.) was a great light at the peak of India’s\nresplendent Gupta\n empire.[1]\n His works display his mastery of Buddhist as well as non-Buddhist\nthought of the day, and he made his mark, successively, upon three\nBuddhist scholastic traditions that are traditionally considered\ndistinct: Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, and\n Yogācāra.[2]\n His master work of Abhidharma thought, the Commentary on the\nTreasury of the Abhidharma\n(Abhidharmakośabhāṣya), is to this day the\nprimary resource for knowledge of “Śrāvaka” or\nnon-Mahāyāna philosophy among Tibetan and East Asian\nBuddhist\n schools.[3]\n His concise works on Yogācāra philosophy set a new standard\nfor that school, which became mainstream Buddhist metaphysics in India\nfor half a millennium\n thereafter.[4]\n Venerated as he is across the Buddhist world, he has always been a\nsubject of disputation. This article will sketch his contested\nbiography and works, and provide summary analyses of his most\nprominent\n arguments.[5]\n \nVasubandhu (4th century C.E.) is dated to the height of the\nGupta period by the fact that, according to Paramārtha, he\nprovided instruction for the crown prince, and queen, of King\n“Vikramāditya”—a name for the great\nChandragupta II (r.\n 380–415).[6]\n Vasubandhu lived his life at the center of controversy, and he won\nfame and patronage through his acumen as an author and debater. His\nwritings, packed as they are with criticisms of his\ncontemporaries’ traditions and views, are an unparalleled\nresource for understanding the debates alive among Buddhist and\nOrthodox (Hindu) schools of his time. \nAs a young Buddhist scholar monk, Vasubandhu is said to have traveled\nfrom his home in Gandhāra to Kashmir, then the heartland of the\nVaibhāṣika philosophical system, to study. There, students\nwere sworn to keep the tradition secret amongst themselves. Vasubandhu\nquestioned Vaibhāṣika orthodoxy and made enemies there, but\nmanaged to return home an expert in the system. Immediately, he\nviolated Kashmiri Vaibhāṣika norms by giving public\nteachings, going so far as to dare all comers to debate him at the end\nof each day. Vasubandhu’s Kashmiri colleagues were livid until\nthey received a copy of the text from which he was teaching, the root\nverses of his Treasury of the Abhidharma. This brilliant\nsummary of their system pleased them immensely. But then, Vasubandhu\npublished his auto-commentary, which criticized the system in various\nways, primarily from a Sautrāntika perspective. Livid again.\nYears later, Vasubandhu’s Vaibhāṣika contemporary\nSaṅghabhadra composed two treatises purporting to refute the\nCommentary, and traveled to Ayodhyā, where Vasubandhu\nwas living under royal patronage, to challenge the master to a public\ndebate (Vasubandhu refused). This narrative, reported in Chinese and\nTibetan sources, accounts for the unusual fact that Vasubandhu’s\nCommentary often disagrees with positions affirmed in the\nTreasury’s root verses. \nVasubandhu’s elder half-brother was Asaṅga, the monk who\nmeditated in solitude for twelve years until he was able to meet with\nand receive teachings directly from the future Buddha, Maitreya.\nAsaṅga thereby became the preeminent expounder of the\nYogācāra synthesis of “Great Vehicle”\n(Mahāyāna) Buddhism, writing some texts himself, and\ntransmitting the so-called “Five Treatises” revealed by\nMaitreya. When he was advanced in years, Asaṅga became worried\nabout his younger brother’s karmic outlook (Vasubandhu had\npublicly insulted Asaṅga’s works). So he sent his students\nto teach Vasubandhu and convince him to adopt the Yogācāra\nsystem. It worked. This narrative provides a reason for\nVasubandhu’s having written many texts from the\nYogācāra perspective after his prior advocacy of so-called\n“Śrāvaka” positions. It explains why the author\nof the Treasury and its Commentary might have gone\non to write several commentaries on Mahāyāna scriptures, a\ntreatise that defends the legitimacy of Mahāyāna scriptures,\nand a series of concise Yogācāra syntheses. \nThe mythologized, hagiographic character of the traditional\nbiographies, together with the (disputed) belief that they contradict\none another, has led a number of modern scholars to doubt their\nveracity. Many have expressed doubts that the mass of extant texts\nattributed to Vasubandhu in the Tibetan and Chinese canons could have\nbeen written by a single individual. In the 1950s Erich Frauwallner\nproposed a thesis that there were two separate Vasubandhus, whom the\ntraditional biographies mistakenly combined into one\n figure.[7]\n Versions of this theory hold sway in some areas of the academy. Some\nscholars have called into question the story of Vasubandhu’s\nconversion from Śrāvaka (non-Mahāyāna) to\nYogācāra under the influence of his brother Asaṅga, by\nnoting a more gradual set of transitions and commonalities across\nworks previously thought to sit on opposite sides of this\n “conversion.”[8]\n An extension of this argument, advocated today by Robert Kritzer and\ncolleagues, holds that Vasubandhu was secretly an advocate of\nYogācāra all\n along.[9] \nVasubandhu composed works from the perspectives of several different\nphilosophical schools. In addition, his works often state doctrinal\npositions and arguments with which he disagrees, in order to refute\nthem. For this reason, scholars have used his works, especially his\nCommentary on the Treasury of the Abhidharma to explicate a\nrange of Buddhist and non-Buddhist positions prevalent during his\ntime. \nThe main Buddhist schools represented in his works are the\nVaibhāṣikas or Sarvāstivādins of Kashmir and\nGandhāra, the Vātsīputrīyas, the Sautrāntikas\n(also called Dārṣtāntikas), and the\nYogācārins. He also argues with non-Buddhist, Orthodox\n(Hindu) positions, including especially Sāṃkhya and\nNyāya-Vaiśeṣika views. It would appear that the only\nBuddhist school with which he always expresses disagreement is the\nVātsīputrīyas, also called the Pudgalavādins or\n“Personalists.” Vasubandhu’s works are most often\nsaid to have been written either from the Sautrāntika perspective\nor from the Yogācāra perspective, depending upon the work.\nYet the verses of his Treasury of the Abhidharma summarize\nthe doctrines of the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣika school. It is only\nin the commentary that the Sautrāntika system tends to win the\nday, through numerous\n arguments.[10]\n And, it is quite often the case, even in the Commentary,\nthat Vaibhāṣika views are left unchallenged or\nunharmed. \nA great number of texts of the Theravāda Abhidharma tradition are\nextant in Pāli, and a great number of Sarvāstivāda\nAbhidharma texts exist in their Chinese translations. In Sanskrit and\nTibetan, however, nearly all of the “Śrāvaka”\nAbhidharma texts that remain are the works of Vasubandhu and the\ncommentarial traditions stemming from them. It is tempting to take\nthis as evidence of Vasubandhu’s philosophical mastery, to have\nso comprehensively defeated his foes that his tradition dominated from\nthe 9th century on. Yet we may equally take this as\nevidence not of the victory of Sautrāntika, but of the influence\nof the rising popularity of Yogācāra in India and Tibet.\nVasubandhu, a great systematizer of mainstream Abhidharma, provided\narguments and doctrines, and a life story, that paved the way to, and\njustified, the later dominance of Mahāyāna. \nVasubandhu wrote in Sanskrit, but many of his works are known from\ntheir Chinese and Tibetan translations alone. It is beyond the\npurposes of this essay to summarize all of the works attributed to\nVasubandhu, or to take into consideration the relevant criteria for\ndetermining his authorship. A quick mention of well-known works must\n suffice.[11]\n Vasubandhu’s most important work of Abhidharma is his\nTreasury of the Abhidharma\n(Abhidharmakośakārikā), with its\nCommentary\n\n(Abhidharmakośabhāṣya).[12]\n After these, his best known works are his concise, Yogācāra\nsyntheses, the Twenty Verses\n(Viṃśikākārikā) with its\nCommentary (Viṃśikāvṛtti), the\nThirty Verses (Triṃśikā), and the\nThree Natures Exposition\n (Trisvabhāvanirdeśa).[13]\n The majority of the arguments discussed below are taken from these\nworks. \nA number of Vasubandhu’s shorter independent works are also\navailable. The Explanation of the Establishment of Action\n(Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa) draws together, synthesizes and\nadvances somewhat the many discussions of karma from the\nTreasury of the Abhidharma—adding a defense of the\nYogācāra concept of the “storehouse\nconsciousness” (ālayavijñāna). The\nExplanation of the Five Aggregates\n(Pañcaskandhaprakaraṇa) is a summary of central\nAbhidharma terminology that includes some Yogācāra\ncross-referencing as well. The Rules for Debate\n(Vādavidhi) is lost, but numerous fragments preserved in\nlater texts show it to be foundational for the development of formal\nBuddhist logic and\n epistemology.[14] \nVasubandhu wrote a number of commentaries on Buddhist scriptures,\nprimarily (but not exclusively) those that are classified as\nMahāyāna Sūtras. He also wrote a tremendously\ninfluential work on how to interpret and teach Buddhist scriptures,\nentitled the Proper Mode of Exposition\n(Vyākhyāyukti), in which (among other things) he\nargued for the legitimacy of the Mahāyāna Sūtras (which\nhe called “Vaipūlya\n Sūtras”).[15] \nAlso quite influential, and still regularly studied in Tibetan\neducational settings, are Vasubandhu’s commentaries on major\nYogācāra works. These include commentaries on three texts\nsaid to have been revealed to Asaṅga by the bodhisattva\nMaitreya, his Commentary on Distinguishing Elements from\nReality (Dharmadharmatāvibhāgavṛtti),\nCommentary on Distinguishing the Middle from the Extremes\n(Madhyāntavibhāgabhāṣya), and\nCommentary on the Ornament to the Great Vehicle Discourses\n(Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkārabhāṣya).\nFinally, Vasubandhu is credited with an important commentary on\nAsaṅga’s Yogācāra summa, the\nCommentary on the Summary of the Great Vehicle\n(Mahāyānasaṃgrahabhāṣya). \nAmong these works, and numerous others attributed to Vasubandhu in the\nTibetan and Chinese canons, one finds countless perspectives and\napproaches represented, and many scholars are skeptical as to the\nunity of the authorship even of the works listed. Many, however, still\nfind it sensible to assume that Vasubandhu worked in various genres\nand schools, and adopted the norms of each, developing his own\nthinking along the way. Yet no narrative of Vasubandhu’s\nintellectual development has achieved scholarly consensus. \nThe Buddhist approach to the question of personal continuity attracts\nperhaps more attention from contemporary philosophy than any other\naspect of the\n tradition.[16]\n Vasubandhu’s Commentary on the Treasury of the\nAbhidharma includes, as its final chapter, an extended defense of\nthe Buddhist doctrine of no-self, entitled, “The Refutation of\nthe Person.” The majority of the argument assumes a Buddhist\ninterlocutor, and is intended to prove that no Buddhist ought to\naccept the reality of a so-called “self”\n(ātman) or “person” (pudgala) over\nand above the five aggregates (skandhas) in which, the Buddha\nsaid, the person consists. (The aggregates, as their name suggests,\nare themselves constantly-changing collections of entities of five\ncategories: the physical, feelings, ideas, dispositions, and\nconsciousness.) Vasubandhu apparently believed that the\nVātsīputrīyas, also called Pudgalavādins or\n“Personalists,” represented a significant, Buddhist rival.\nLate in the chapter, Vasubandhu also provides some arguments that are\ntargeted at a Vaiśeṣika (Hindu) view of the self. \nThe chapter begins with a brief statement of the soteriological\npurpose of the treatise, and something of a definition of the\nBuddha’s teachings. Vasubandhu says that for outsiders (meaning\noutsiders to Buddhism), there is no possibility of liberation, because\nall other systems impose a false construct of a self upon what is\nreally only the continuum of aggregates (skandha). Since\ngrasping the self generates the mental afflictions\n(kleśa), liberation from suffering is impossible for one\nwho holds onto the false, non-Buddhist view that the self has\nindependent reality. \nVasubandhu does not attempt, here, to prove the karmic causality that\njustifies his soteriological exclusivism. Instead, he moves directly\nto prove the non-existence of the self. What is real, he says, is\nknown by one of two means: perception or\n inference.[17]\n Seven things are known directly, by perception. They include the five\nobjects of the senses (visual forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and\ntouchables), mental objects (mental images or ideas), and the mind\n itself.[18]\n What is not known directly can only be known indirectly, by\ninference. As an example, Vasubandhu provides an argument that the\nfive sense organs (eye, ear, nose, tongue, skin) can each be\ninferred from the awareness of their respective sensory objects. But,\nhe says, there is no such inference for the self. Since Vasubandhu\nbelieves in universal momentariness (see the section on Momentariness\nand Continuity), he would reject Descartes’ deduction of\n“I am,” as an enduring self, from the perception of the\nmomentary mental event, “I think.” \nVasubandhu does not list the five aggregates here, but his discussion\nof perception and inference stands in for having done so. Any Buddhist\nscholastic would be able to see that he has claimed to have proven the\nreality of the twelve sense bases (āyatana), and these\ntwelve are easy to correlate with the five aggregates. The first\naggregate, the physical (rūpa), includes the five\nsensory organs and their five objects. The second, third, and fourth\naggregates—feelings (vedanā), thoughts\n(saṃjñā), and dispositions\n(saṃskāra)—are kinds of mental objects. The\nfifth aggregate, consciousness (vijñāna), is\nequivalent to the twelfth sense base, the\n mind.[19]\n Earlier in the Treasury Vasubandhu had included other\nelements within the five aggregates (including, for instance,\navijñapti-rūpa, which is imperceptible, within\nthe physical), but since he had also provided arguments\ndisproving those elements (see the section on Disproof of\nInvisible Physicality), perhaps he felt no compulsion to include them\nhere. Focusing on the twelve sense bases may be Vasubandhu’s way\nof providing as clean and parsimonious a Buddhist ontology as he\ncan. \nIn any event, Vasubandhu is affirming the mainstream Buddhist view\nthat the constantly-changing elements, which seem to be the\npossessions of, or the components of, the so-called\n“self,” are real, while the self is unreal. Buddhists\nreadily admit that this view is counterintuitive (if it were intuitive\nwe would all be liberated), and many doubts may arise when it is\nposited: If there is no self, then what is the same about me as a\nchild and as an adult? What is named by my name? What perceives\nperceptions, or experiences experiences, or enacts actions, if not the\nself? What is memory, without a self? And crucially, from a Buddhist\nperspective, what transmigrates from one body to the next, and reaps\nthe karmic fruit of good and evil deeds, if not a self? These are all\nquestions of great importance in Buddhist philosophical treatments of\nthe doctrine of no-self, and Vasubandhu will address them each in due\ncourse. Vasubandhu begins, however, by focusing on certain commonsense\nadvantages to the no-self view, and exposing the difficulties in\nholding to the reality of the self. His first target, then, is\nBuddhist “Personalists.” \nFor Vasubandhu, everything that is real or substantial\n(dravya) is causally efficient, having specifiable\ncause-and-effect relations with other entities. Everything that does\nnot have such a causal basis is unreal, and if anything, it is merely\na conceptual construct, a mere convention (prajñapti).\nThe so-called “person,” like everything else, must be one\nor the other—real or unreal, causally conditioned or\nconceptually constructed. Vasubandhu places it in the latter category.\nNotice that, to call something a “conceptual construction”\n(parikalpita) is, for Vasubandhu, to remove it from the flow\nof causality. Abstract entities have no causal impetus and are unreal.\nThis is Vasubandhu’s formalization, and expansion, of the\nBuddhist doctrine that all conditioned things are impermanent. Some\nBuddhists accept (for instance) that space and nirvana are real,\nthough unconditioned. Vasubandhu says, instead, that all things that\nare engaged with the causal world must be, themselves, conditioned\n(this is a corollary of his proof of momentariness), so he rejects the\ncausal capacity of eternal, unchanging entities. But even setting\naside Vasubandhu’s expanded view, it is clearly out of the\nquestion for Buddhists to say that the self is unconditioned\nand eternal. That is a non-Buddhist view, which Vasubandhu treats\nlater on. \nVasubandhu thus begins his argument by posing a dilemma for the\nPersonalists, between saying that the “person” is\nuncaused—which would be to adopt a non-Buddhist view—and\nspecifying the cause. Since the Buddha explained the aggregates to be\nthe psychophysical elements that make up the person, any posited\n“self” must be in some way related to those entities. But\nthe Personalists will not wish to say simply that the\n“person” is caused by the aggregates. For, the aggregates\nare temporary and impermanent in the extreme. The whole issue at hand\nis how to account for the continuity of the person as the aggregates\nchange. If the aggregates are the cause(s) of the person, then the\nperson, too, must change as they change. As Vasubandhu explains in\ncriticizing a parallel context, “No unchanging quality is seen\nto inhere in changing substances.” (AKBh\n 159.20)[20]\n If the causal basis is accepted as changing, the “person”\nis no longer continuous across the aggregates and through time. So a\n“person” caused by the aggregates provides no answer to\nthe doubts about personal identity raised above. \nYet for Vasubandhu, if the cause cannot be specified, then the person\nmust be conceptually constructed. He adduces the following as an\nexample of conceptual construction: When we see, smell, and taste\nmilk, we have distinct sensory impressions, which are combined in our\nawareness. The “milk,” then, is a mental construct—a\nconcept built out of discrete sensory impressions. The sensory\nimpressions are real, but the milk is not. In the same way, the\n“self” is made up of constantly-changing sensory organs,\nsensory impressions, ideas, and mental events. These separate,\nmomentary elements are real, but their imagined unity—as an\nenduring “I”—is a false projection. \nThe Personalists are willing to accept that the person is a conceptual\nconstruction, but they do not accept that this makes it unreal, or\ncausally inert. They believe in a perceptible “person,”\nwho is ineffably neither the same as nor distinct from the aggregates,\nbut who comes into existence in a particular lifetime “depending\nupon” the aggregates. Vasubandhu considers this a muddled\nattempt to have one’s cake and eat it too. He focuses in on this\nterm, “depending upon.” If, by this, the Personalists mean\n“dependent as a conceptual object,” he says, then really\nthey are conceding that the term “person” actually just\nrefers to the aggregates. It is to admit that the aggregates are\nunderstood as unified through a mere conceptual construction,\n“person,” just as the taste, touch, and smell of milk\ngenerate the conceptual construction, “milk.” If, on the\nother hand, they are saying the “person” is\ncausally dependent upon the aggregates, then they are saying\nthat the “person” is caused by the aggregates, which is to\nspecify its causes among impermanent entities. \nThere is, for Vasubandhu, no acceptable explanation of conceptual\nconstructs as real entities. His exclusive dichotomy (real &\ncausal vs. unreal & conceptual) serves not only as a tool for\nrefusing a separate self, but also as a method of denying apparent\nsubject/object relations or apparent substance/quality relations, and\ntranslating them into linear, causal series. For instance, he says\nthat objects of awareness do not exist as causally significant\nentities distinct from consciousness; rather, consciousness is\ncaused by its apparent objects, from which it takes on a\nparticular shape (ākāra). This is how Vasubandhu\nresolves some of the standard challenges to the no-self view, such as\nthe question of how experience can exist without an experiencer. The\nanswer is that any given awareness only appears to be made up\nof two parts, subject and object, a “cognizer” acting upon\na cognitive object. In reality, any given moment of awareness consists\nin a full, constructed appearance of subject/object duality without\nthere actually being any separate subject. The object is an aspect or\nshape of the consciousness itself. Similarly, when asked with regard\nto memory “who” remembers if not the self, Vasubandhu\nrejects the subject/object structure. What is really occurring is only\na series of discrete elements in the continuum of aggregates, which\narise successively, causally linked to one another. The reason I\nremember my past is because my aggregates now are the causal result of\nthe past aggregates whose actions I remember. My consciousness today\narises with the shape of my past aggregates imprinted upon it. \nMoving on, the “dependence” relation that the Personalists\nare attempting to defend resists none of Vasubandhu’s arguments\n(a casualty, perchance, of its appearing as a counterargument within\nhis text), but the Personalists persist by stating that the relation\nbetween the person and the aggregates is “ineffable.” To\nthis, Vasubandhu argues, interestingly, that ineffability in regard to\nan entity that is ostensibly perceived undermines the functionality of\nperception as a source of knowledge. Without any way of\ndistinguishing, clearly, what is perceived directly and what is\nperceived “ineffably,” all of perception becomes\npotentially ineffable. And, perhaps more importantly, not everything\nis said by the Buddha to be ineffable, or at least not equally so. For\ninstance, when the Buddha denies the reality of the self, he does so\nin contradistinction to the sense bases. If the\n“person” also exists as an object of sensory perception,\nhow can this distinction be upheld? \nVasubandhu’s dialogue with the Personalists takes some rather\ntechnical twists and turns, which I will not attempt to cover here.\nSee the section on scripture for a summary of Vasubandhu’s\nmethods of scriptural interpretation, which he employs decisively to\ndefend against the Personalist adducement of the Buddha’s\nsilence on the nature of the person. I will here mention only one\nfurther argument against the Personalists, before treating\nVasubandhu’s arguments with non-Buddhists. \nThe Personalist challenges Vasubandhu to explain how it can be, if\neverything is only a constantly-changing fluctuation of\ncausally-connected separate entities, that things do not arise in\npredictable patterns. Why is there so much unpredictable change, the\nPersonalists are asking, if there is no independent person who enacts\nthose changes? This is a question that seems to be affirming a greater\ndegree of freedom of the will than would appear possible were there\nnot some outside, uncaused intervener in the causal flow. If I am\nreading it correctly, it is something like an incredulous denial that\nwe could be “mere automatons,” given our capacities for\ninnovation and creativity. Vasubandhu’s answer is to emphasize\nthe possibility of change in a self-regulating\n system.[21] \nVasubandhu points out that in fact, there are predictable\npatterns to the causal fluctuations of thoughts, so it is a mistake to\ncall them unpredictable. Seeing a woman, he says, causes you to think\nthoughts that you tend to think when you look at women. (If we needed\nit, here’s confirmation that the implied reader is a\nheterosexual male—though probably a celibate one.) If you\npractice leaving a woman alone in your thoughts (for instance, by\npracticing thinking of the woman’s overprotective father, as\nmonks are taught to do), then when you see a woman you’ll reject\nher in your thoughts. If you do not practice this, other thoughts\narise: “…then those [thoughts] which are most frequent\n[or clearest], or most proximate arise, because they have been most\nforcefully cultivated, except when there are simultaneous special\nconditions external to the body.” (Kapstein 2001a: 370) This is\nan argument that undermines a naïve trust in the independence of\nthe will. But of course, Vasubandhu adds, just because the mind is\nsubject to conditions does not mean that it will always be the same.\nOn the contrary, it is fundamental to the definition of conditioned\nthings that they are always changing. \nIt is with this setup that Vasubandhu turns to address the\nnon-Buddhist sectarians, asking them to account as elegantly as his\ncausal, no-self view does, for the changing flux of mental events.\nFor, the non-Buddhist opponent believes in an independent self who is\nthe agent and controller of mental actions. If that is so, Vasubandhu\nchallenges them, why do mental events arise in such disorder? Just\nwhat kind of a controller is the “self”? This is an\nimportant point, because it implies that Buddhists might use as\nevidence what is introspectively obvious to any\nmeditator—namely, the difficulty of controlling the mind. If the\n“self” is an uncaused agent, why can’t I, for\ninstance, focus my concentration indefinitely? Non-Buddhist\n(orthodox/Hindu) traditions generally affirm that the mind must be\ncontrolled, and harnessed, by the self; this is one of the central\nmeanings of the term yoga (lit. “yoking”) in\nclassical Hinduism. And, of course, the reason that such\n“yoking” is necessary is that the mind has its own causal\nimpetus, which overwhelms the self unless and until the self attains\nliberation. Vasubandhu asks why, if changes in experience must be\nadmitted to originate in the fluctuations of the mind, it should be\nbelieved that the “yoking” and other willful, agent-driven\nevents originate outside of the mind in an unchanging\n“self.” The need for such an explanation is evidence that\nthe “self” requires a more burdensome (less simple)\ntheoretical structure than might appear at first blush. \nThe Buddhist view has an in-built explanation for the difficulty of\nchanging the mind’s dispositions. Each temporary collection of\npsychophysical entities generates, through causal regularities,\nanother collection in the next moment. The mind’s present\ndispositions are conditioned by its past, and its every experience is\nonly an expression of its internal transformations, triggered of\ncourse by influences coming from outside the individual. It is widely\nconsidered a difficulty for the Buddhist no-self view that it has\ntrouble accounting for our intuitive senses of continuity and control.\nBut here we see Vasubandhu turning a disadvantage into an advantage.\nThe intuitive sense of control is a mistake. This is introspectively\nobvious and is implicit in the non-Buddhist’s admission that a\nmental series, distinct from the “self,” is dependent upon\nits own causal impetus. Of course, the non-Buddhists have a panoply of\ntheories explaining the relation between the self and the mental\nevents with which it is complexly entwined. This is territory over\nwhich Indian thought contemplates free will and determinism.\nVasubandhu does not enter into these debates in any detail. His\ninterest is only to indicate the Buddhist position’s comparative\nsimplicity and causal parsimony. \nIn the last stages of the chapter, Vasubandhu’s non-Buddhist\nbeliever in a permanent self proposes several potential\ncounter-arguments. Here Vasubandhu addresses a number of common\nworries about the no-self view, including the questions of experience\nand agency without a self. With regard to experience, Vasubandhu\nsimply makes reference to the argument above in which the\nsubject/object relation was described in a causal line, with the\nobject causing a consciousness to take on the “shape” or\nappearance of an object. An individual, momentary consciousness does\nnot need to be possessed by a self in order to have a certain\nappearance. With regard to agency, Vasubandhu again redescribes the\nstructure under consideration—in this case, the act/agent\nstructure—as a unitary, causal line: “From recollection\nthere is interest; from interest consideration; from consideration\nwillful effort; from willful effort vital energy; and from that,\naction. So what does the self do\n here?”[22]\n (Kapstein 2001a: 373) The point, again, is not that there is no\naction, but that action takes place as one event in a causal series,\nno element of which requires an independent agent. \nThe last argument in the work addresses the crucial, Buddhist concern\nabout karmic fruits. If there is no self, how can there be karmic\nresults accruing to the agent of karmic acts? What can it mean to say\nthat, if I kill someone, I go to hell, when there is no\n“I”? The way the question is phrased is in terms of a\ntechnical question about the nature of karmic retribution. The way\nthat karma works in the non-Buddhist schools is, naturally, via the\nself. In one way or another, karmic residue adheres to the soul/self.\nIf there is no soul that is affected by the karmic residue, how can\nyou be affected at a later time by a previous cause? How can something\nI do now affect me at the time of my death, if at that time the deed\nwill be in the past? \nVasubandhu gives a clear, if quick reply. A complete answer to this\nquestion would require a fuller discussion of the question of\n continuity.[23]\n (See the sections Momentariness and Continuity and Disproof of\nInvisible Physicality below.) The short answer is simply that the past\naction inaugurates a causal series, which eventuates in the result at\na later time via a number of intermediate steps. When I act now, it\ndoes not alter some eternal soul, but it does alter the future of my\naggregates by sparking a causal series. As he does many times\nthroughout his disproof of the person, Vasubandhu encourages his\nopponents to recognize the term “I” as simply referring to\nthe continuum of aggregates. The conceptual construction\n“I” is then understood to be only a manner of speaking, a\nuseful shorthand. He mentions that when I say “I am pale,”\nI know that it is only my body, not my eternal self, that is pale. Why\nnot apply such figurative use to the term overall? Then, when I say\nthat “I” experience the result of “my”\nactions, it can be seen to be both clear and accurate. Granted, it\nseems like there is a real “self.” But it only\nlooks that way, just as a line of ants looks like a brown stripe on\nthe ground. Close philosophical and introspective attention reveals\nthat what seemed like a solid, coherent whole is in fact a false\nmental construction based upon a failure to notice its countless,\nfluctuating parts. \nFor centuries before Vasubandhu, Buddhist philosophers of the\nSarvāstivādin tradition had believed in, and argued for, the\ndoctrine of universal\n momentariness.[24]\n This view was a Buddhist scholastic interpretation and expression of\nthe Buddha’s doctrine that all things in the world of ordinary\nbeings were subject to causes and conditions, and therefore\nimpermanent. Buddhists rejected the notion of substances with changing\nqualities, and affirmed instead that change was logically impossible.\nTo be, for Buddhists, is to express certain inalienable\ncharacteristics, whereas to change must be to exhibit the nature of a\ndifferent being. Vasubandhu adopts this view, employing it in many\ncontexts: “As for something that becomes different: that very\nthing being different is not accepted, for it is not acceptable that\nit differs from itself.” (AKBh 193.9–10) \nOne can see how the impossibility of change, coupled with the doctrine\nof impermanence, served to prove that all things persisted for only a\nmoment. Vasubandhu certainly shared this view, and he drew upon the\npremises of impermanence and the impossibility of change to establish\nmomentariness in his own works. Yet, as von Rospatt (1995) has shown,\nVasubandhu added a new twist to the argument. What he added was that\nthings must self-destruct, for destruction cannot be caused.\nAnd why not? Because a cause and a result are real entities, and the\nostensible object of a destruction is a non-existent. How, he asks,\ncan a non-existent be a result? \nGiven that things must bring about their own destruction, then,\nVasubandhu needs only to recall the impossibility of change to\nestablish momentariness. If things have it as part of their nature to\nself-destruct, they must do so immediately upon coming into being. If\nthey do not have it as part of their nature, it can never become\n so.[25] \nThe great difficulty for such a position is accounting for apparent\ncontinuities. The standard Buddhist explanation is that usually, when\nthings go out of existence, they are replaced in the next moment by\nnew elements of the same kind, and these streams of entities cause the\nappearance of continuity. Modern interpreters often illustrate the\npoint with the example of the apparent motion on a movie screen being\ncaused by a quick succession of stills. This is said to be the case\nwith the many entities that appear to make up the continuous self, and\nof course this was the main reason the Buddha affirmed his doctrine of\nimpermanence in the first place. Yet for some phenomena, to call their\ncontinuity merely apparent causes philosophical problems, even for\nBuddhists. Consequently, Vasubandhu, like his Sarvāstivāda\nforbears, was repeatedly preoccupied with the need to account for\ncontinuity. \nMany of the more prominent problems in continuity have already been\nmentioned in the discussion of Vasubandhu’s disproof of the self\n(see above), including the problem of memory, the problem of the\nreference of a name, and the problem of karmic causality across\nmultiple lifetimes. See also the section on the disproof of invisible\nphysicality for Vasubandhu’s rejection of the\nVaibhāṣika response to a specific problem of\ncontinuity. \nOne issue of great importance for the Vaibhāṣika and\nYogācāra traditions, and consequently of interest to current\n scholarship,[26]\n is a problem specific to Buddhist meditation theory. The problem\ncomes from an apparent inconsistency among well-founded early Buddhist\nscriptural positions. On the one hand, there was the orthodox belief\nthat the body was kept alive by consciousness. Even in deep sleep, it\nwas believed that there was some form of subtle consciousness that was\nkeeping the body alive. On the other hand, there was the very old\nbelief, possibly articulated by the Buddha himself, that there are six\nkinds of consciousness, and that each of them is associated with one\nof the six senses—the five traditional senses, plus the mental\nsense (which observes mental objects). The problem was that there are\nsome meditative states that are defined as being completely free of\nall six sensory consciousnesses. So the question becomes,\nWhat keeps the meditator’s body alive when all consciousness is\ncut off? \nRelated to this is the problem that, given that each element can be\ncaused only by a previous element of a corresponding kind (in an\nimmediately preceding moment), there does not seem to be any way for\nthe consciousness, once cut off, to restart. The distinctive,\nearly Yogācāra doctrine of the “store\nconsciousness” (ālayavijñāna) or the\n“hidden consciousness”—the consciousness that is\ntucked away in the body—was first introduced to solve these\ncontinuity problems. Equally problematic is the same issue in reverse:\nWithout some doctrinal shift there does not seem to be any way that\nbeings born into formless realms, with no bodies, could be reborn\namong those with physical form. The later, Yogācāra view\nthat everything is only appearance takes care of this, too, by\neliminating the need for real physicality. (See the section concerning\ndisproof of invisible physicality.) Vasubandhu sets out these problems\nin the Treasury of the Abhidharma without resolving them;\nwhen he writes from a Yogācāra perspective, he resolves them\nwith recourse to the store consciousness and appearance-only. \nIn a complex but significant passage from the Treasury of the\nAbhidharma, Vasubandhu provides refutations to arguments that\ndefend the necessity of there being a special kind of physicality,\ncalled “unperceived physicality,” or “invisible\nphysicality,”\n (avijñaptirūpa).[27]\n As is made clear throughout these arguments, this entity\n(dharma) was affirmed by the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas\nin order to account for the karmic effects of our physical and vocal\nactions. \nThe need for such an entity reflects a conundrum unique to Buddhist\nmorality, premised as it is upon the lawlike, causal regularity of\nkarma operating in the absence of any divine intervention. The issue\nat hand is not in itself the question of karmic continuity in the\nabsence of a self, but rather a particular aspect of that larger\nproblem. (See the sections concerning disproof of the self and\nmomentariness and continuity.) For this argument, then, let us agree\nthat the continuum of consciousness carries on after death, and that\none’s future rebirth is therefore determined by the shape and\ncharacter of one’s consciousness at death. Given that, we can\nsee how a mental action—say, holding a wrong view, or slandering\nthe Buddha in one’s thoughts—can have consequences for\none’s future, by directly affecting the shape of one’s\nconsciousness. But how do actions of speech and body—such as\ninsulting, or hitting someone—bear their karmic fruit in the\nmental continuum? Surely forming the intention to hit someone is a\nconsequential mental act. We might think that Buddhists would simply\nsay that it is karmically equivalent, then, to intend to do\nsomething (which is a mental act) and to actually do it.\nAlthough there is some blurring of the line here (the Buddha does give\ngreat moral weight to merely intending to act), intentions and the\nbodily (or vocal) acts that follow from them are understood as\ndistinct types of actions with distinct karmic results. Furthermore,\nthe Buddha is said to have indicated that the karmic effect—and\nso the moral significance—of doing something is\nadditionally dependent upon the success of the action.\nAttempted murder is not punished to the same degree as murder, even\nkarmically. \nThese distinctions accord with widely held moral instincts, but the\nAbhidharma philosophers needed a full, causal explanation for why the\nsuccessful results of physical actions bring about their distinctive\neffects in one’s consciousness. I can see how my plunging a\nknife into someone affects him; but how his dying (which may\nhappen later, in the hospital) affects me is invisible, or\nuncognized. How does what goes around, come around? The\nVaibhāṣika answer is that, since his death is a physical\nevent, there must be another physical event—the invisible\nphysicality—which impinges upon me. \nVasubandhu rejects this entity, and provides a compelling explanation\nof the Buddha’s differentiation between intentions, acts, and\nsuccess that does not need to appeal to invisible physicality.\nAlthough here Vasubandhu answers through the mouth of another (and so,\npresents this position without explicitly endorsing it), he advocates\nsomething like this position more forcefully in his later,\nExplanation of the Establishment of\n Action.[28]\n He admits that there must be a karmic difference between (1) merely\nintending, (2) intending and acting, and (3) intending, acting and\naccomplishing the deed. But the difference does not come from the\naccomplishment of the result itself—that is, it does not come\nfrom the death of the murder victim. Rather, the karmic effect is the\nresult of my experience and my beliefs. If I experience myself\nstabbing someone, and I know that the person died (even if by\nreading the newspaper the next day), I gain a fuller karmic result\nthan I would have by simply intending to act. \nThe Vaibhāṣikas present a number of other arguments that\nsuggest the necessity of invisible physicality, all of which follow a\nsimilar logic. A close parallel to the example above is a murder by\nproxy; why do I experience a karmic result if the hit man I’ve\nhired does his job, but not if he doesn’t? My action was the\nsame either way. The Vaibhāṣikas also point to the\nenduring, karmic benefits of having taken vows to refrain from\nnegative actions such as killing or stealing. These vows generate a\nkarmic benefit in spite of their being fulfilled through not acting.\nHow is this non-action different from that of someone who\njust happens not to be killing or stealing? Another\nargument suggests that advanced practitioners in refined meditative\nstates cannot be said to be practicing the eight-fold path of the\nBuddha’s teachings, since it includes “right\nspeech,” “right action” and “right\nlivelihood”—but no action at all can be taken while in\nmeditative equipoise. Finally, another argument points out that a\ndonor gains great karmic merit when (obviously, later) the monk who\nreceives and eats her gift of food uses its energy to attain a great\nmeditative accomplishment. \nSuch arguments draw upon numerous scriptures to indicate that morally\nsignificant effects seem to take place in the world even when physical\nactions are no longer possible or relevant. In each case, Vasubandhu\nreinterprets the scripture, or the situation, or both, in such a way\nas to make it sensible to describe the effect without appealing to\ninvisible physicality. In the case of the vow, Vasubandhu says that a\nvow helps a vow-taker to remember not to do immoral deeds, and the\ndisciplinary vows of monks have the effect of transforming the whole\ncharacter of the mind. Therefore a disciplined vow-taker does not act\nwithout the thought of the vow arising. The vow does not cause a\nmagical imprint on some invisible entity; it transforms the\ndispositions of the vow-taker. The same is true of the meditating\npractitioner; there is no lack of “right action” during\nmeditation, because the meditator’s continuum of aggregates is\nstill disposed to act properly after the meditation session\nis complete. Such arguments exhibit Vasubandhu’s general pattern\nof reducing apparent continuities to causal chains of momentary\nevents, and eliminating as many extraneous elements from the system as\npossible. \nIn the Treasury, Vasubandhu provides an argument against the\nexistence of Īśvara, a God who is the sovereign creator of\n everything.[29]\n For Vasubandhu, theism is essentially the absurd notion that all of\ncreation might be the result of a single cause. He begins his disproof\nwith what has been called verbal equivocation (Katsura 2003, p. 113),\nand might also be taken as a joke or a pun: \nLiving beings proceed from conditions; nor is it the case that\n“the cause (kāraṇa) of all the world is a\nsingle Īśvara, Puruṣa or Pradhāna [i.e.,\nGod].” \nWhat is the reason (hetu) for this? \nIf you think it is established upon the provision of a reason\n(hetu), this is a refusal of the statement, “the cause\n(kāraṇa) of all is a single\nĪśvara.” (AKBh 101.19–21) \nThe pun is in the fact that the word for “reason,”\nhetu, also means “cause.” It is as if Vasubandhu\nis saying, “If you’re looking for my [just] cause\nfor believing this, then clearly you don’t believe God is the\ncause of everything! If I believe it, it must be\n’cause God made me believe it!” This is somewhat\nsilly, and apparently an equivocation between reasons and causes. \nA more serious reading, though, rises to the surface when we notice\nthat Vasubandhu does not, in fact, verbally equivocate. He uses the\nword hetu to refer to reasons, and another word,\nkāraṇa, to refer to causes. In his own philosophy,\nVasubandhu separates these two regions of reality quite strictly:\n“Causes” are real, substantial entities, whereas\n“reasons” are conceptual constructs devoid of causal\ncapacity. (Cf. Davidson’s “Anomalism of the Mental”;\nsee the entries on\n anomalous monism\n and\n Donald Davidson.)\n This is not to say that Vasubandhu would endorse Sellars’s\nnotion that ideas which inhabit the normative “space of\nreasons” are irreducible to those within the “space of\ncauses.” (See the discussion of the myth of the given, in the\nentry on\n Wilfrid Sellars.)\n He would not; on the contrary, for Vasubandhu, to say that something\nis a conceptual construct is to say that it is caused, but in\na way quite different from how it appears. This is developed\nexplicitly in his Yogācāra theory of the Three Natures of\nall entities, where one of the natures is said to be how things\nappear, and another is how things are caused. (See the\ndiscussion of three natures and non-duality.) \nYet here in the Treasury Vasubandhu is only gesturing in this\ndirection. His non-Buddhist opponents would also like to distinguish\nreasons from causes, so instead of attempting to unify their causal\nbasis himself, Vasubandhu suggests that commitment to the unitary\nnature of divine causality commits them to conflating them. The\nserious point behind the opening joke, then, is that philosophy\nrequires that we make distinctions among ideas and entities, and\ndebate assumes differences of opinion and perspective. For Vasubandhu,\nsuch differences are evidence that it is impossible that all things\nhave issued from a single cause. He begins, then, with a shot across\nthe bow, which expresses just how seriously he will hold the theists\nto their claim that all things have one cause. \nThe majority of Vasubandhu’s argument consists in his support\nfor the notion that the diversity of the world—especially its\nchanges through time—are inconsistent with the notion of a\nsingle creator. An important, implicit premise in this argument is the\nnotion that things do not change their defining, characteristic\nnatures. Everything is what it is: “As for something that\nbecomes different: that very thing being different is not accepted,\nfor it is not acceptable that it differs from itself.” (AKBh\n193.9–10) Thus, if God is the cause of everything, God is\nalways the cause of everything—or, if God’s\nnature at time t is to be the cause of everything, then God\nmust cause everything at time t. \nIn response, the theist proposes a variety of predictable\nalternatives. One option is that God is posited as the creator of each\nspecific thing at its specific time due to God’s having unique,\ntemporally-indexed desires. One person is caused by God’s desire\nfor a person to be born in Gandhāra in the fourth century, and\nanother person is caused by God’s desire for a person to be born\nin New York City in 1969. Vasubandhu responds that if that is the\ncase, then things are not caused by a unitary God, but rather each\nthing is caused by one of God’s countless, distinct desires.\nFurthermore, the theist is then responsible to account for the causes\nof those specific desires. \nIn addition, specific temporally-indexed desires imply that something\nis interfering with God’s creative action—namely, the\nparticular temporal location. If God is capable of—not only\ncapable of, but having it as His inherent nature to be—creating\nsomething, what could possibly prevent that thing’s occurrence\nat every moment in which God is expressing God’s own nature\n(which should be every moment forever)? If God has the desire for a\ntree in Washington Square Park in 2010, it should always be 2010, with\na tree in Washington Square Park. Why should God wait? (This argument\nrelies upon a typical Buddhist penchant for particulars and moments as\nthe touchstone of the\n real.[30]) \nOne unwise option the theist proposes is that God’s creation\nchanges through time because God is using other\nelements—material causes, for instance—to bring things\ninto being, and those elements follow their own causal laws. That, of\ncourse, makes God’s actions subject to other causes, and amounts\nto the Buddhist view that all things are the results of multiple\ncauses and conditions. Furthermore, when it is proposed that God\nengages in creation for his own pleasure (prīti),\nVasubandhu replies that this means that God is not sovereign because\nHe requires a means (upāya) to bring about a cause,\nnamely his own pleasure. As a cap to this argument, Vasubandhu mocks\nthe idea that a praiseworthy God should be satisfied with the evident\nsuffering of sentient beings. Thus, along with his causal argument,\nVasubandhu throws in a barb from the argument from evil. \nVasubandhu’s final argument in this section is to say that\ntheists are, or ought to be, committed to the denial of apparent\ncauses and conditions. If you think that God is the only cause, then\nyou must deny that seeds cause sprouts. This may seem like another\noverly literalistic reading of the nature of God as the only cause,\nbut is God really deserving of the name “cause,” if He has\nintermediary causes do His work of creation? For, Vasubandhu points\nout, ordinarily we do not require that something be an uncaused cause\nin order to call it a “cause.” We call a seed a cause of a\nsprout, even if it is itself caused by a previous plant. So to say\nthat God is the “cause” of the sprout whereas the seed is\nnot amounts to denying a visible cause and replacing it with\nan invisible one. To avoid this, the theist might say that to call God\nthe “cause” is to say that God is the original cause of\ncreation. But if this is what God is doing to gain the name\n“cause,” and God is beginningless (uncaused), then\ncreation too must be beginningless—which means that, once again,\nGod has nothing to do. \nVasubandhu was a master of Buddhist scripture. A great number of\nscriptural commentaries are attributed to him, and we find Vasubandhu\nciting scripture literally hundreds of times throughout his\nphilosophical works. (Pāsādika 1989) Furthermore, Vasubandhu\nis one of very few Indian or Tibetan authors to have written a\ntreatise dedicated to the interpretation and exposition of Buddhist\nscripture, called the Proper Mode of Exposition\n (Vyākhyāyukti).[31]\n Here is not the place for a thorough survey of this material, which\nawaits future research. It is, however, worth sketching a\ncharacteristic pattern in Vasubandhu’s citation of scripture,\nand noting its relation to his view of scripture in the Proper\nMode of Exposition. \nLike other scholastic philosophers, Vasubandhu often cites scriptures\nin support of an argument. Unlike many others, however, Vasubandhu\nregularly presents a scriptural passage as a potential\ncounter-argument, only to refute the traditional interpretation of the\npassage. The opponent’s interpretation, moreover, is quite often\nthe most literal or direct reading of the passage in question. One of\nVasubandhu’s characteristic philosophical moves, then, is to\nargue in favor of a secondary interpretation of a given scriptural\npassage that might, on its face, be thought to disprove his view. \nA prominent, paradigmatic example of this use of scriptural citation\ntakes place in the Twenty Verses Commentary. As will be\ndiscussed below (in the section concerning defense of appearance\nonly), this text is dedicated to proving the central\nYogācāra thesis of “appearance only”\n(vijñaptimātra)—that is, that everything in\nthe many worlds of living beings is only apparent, with no real\nexistence outside of perception. A central challenge to this\nidealistic view, then, comes from the objector’s simple\nstatement that, “If the images of physical forms, and so on,\nwere just consciousness, not physical things, then the Buddha would\nnot have spoken of the existence of the sense bases of physical form,\nand so on.” (Viṃś 5) Vasubandhu thus adduces\nthe Buddha’s word as the basis of the objection. Then, he turns\nto further scriptures to account for, and explain away, this extremely\nwell-founded Buddhist doctrine. \nVasubandhu’s response to his internal objector is to explain\nthat the passages in question need to be understood as spoken with a\n“special intention” (abhiprāya—on\nwhich, see Broido 1985, Collier 1998 and Tzohar 2018). Furthermore, in\naddition to defending the idea of reinterpreting scripture in general,\nVasubandhu defends the act of reinterpretation in this case. In fact,\nwe may distinguish four separate elements of the argument: (1)\nVasubandhu explains the Buddha’s general practice of speaking\nwords that are not technically true, but are beneficial to his\nlisteners. (2) He proves that such interpretations are sometimes\nnecessary, by providing two passages that without such a reading would\nprove the Buddha to have contradicted himself. (3) He provides an\nexplanation of the Buddha’s “special intention” in\nthe passage under discussion—that is, he declares what the\nBuddha actually believes on the topic. And, (4) he suggests\nwhy, in this case, the Buddha might have chosen to speak the words he\ndid, instead of simply saying what he really believed. \nFor (1) and (2), Vasubandhu explains that the Buddha’s statement\nthat “there is a self-generated living being\n(satva)” must be taken as having a “special\nintention,” so as to prevent its contradicting his statement\nthat “there is no self or living being (satva), only\nentities with causes.” (Viṃś 5) Vasubandhu\nsays that the Buddha spoke the first statement in the context of\nexplaining karma, in order to indicate that the continuity of the\nmental series was not “cut off” (uccheda). If the\nBuddha had taught about the no-self doctrine at the time he delivered\nthe discourse on “the self-generated living being,” his\nlisteners would have been led to this false view that the mental\nstream comes to an end at death. Such a false view is often translated\nas “nihilism,” and among Buddhists it is considered far\nmore dangerous than the false belief in a self, because it entails the\nfurther false view that our moral actions have no afterlife\n consequences.[32]\n If you believe that, then you are liable to act in a way that\nwill lead you to hell. \nThe danger of nihilism is perhaps the primary justification for the\nBuddha’s having spoken words that were technically untrue.\nVasubandhu provides a similar example in the “Disproof of the\nPerson” section of the Treasury. (See the section\nconcerning disproof of person.) There, Vasubandhu was arguing with the\nPersonalists, who pointed to a scripture in which the Buddha remained\nsilent when asked whether or not the person existed after death. The\nPersonalists, of course, saw this as evidence that the Buddha affirmed\nthe ineffability of the person. Vasubandhu says, in response, that the\nBuddha explained quite clearly (to Ānanda, his disciple, after\nthe questioner left) why there had been no good way to answer. To\naffirm a self would be to imply a false doctrine, but to deny the self\n(in this case, stating the truth) would cause the confused questioner\nto fall into a still greater falsehood: Namely, the thought of\nformerly having had a self, but now having none. This is the view,\nonce again, of the self being “cut off” or\n“destroyed” (uccheda), the view that leads to\nmoral nihilism. \nThe danger of the false view of “destruction” is an\nextreme case, in which the Buddha is silent so as not to have to lead\nhis disciple into a dangerous view. To what degree can this paradigm\nbe extended to suggest other, perhaps less dire, cases in which the\nBuddha may have neglected to speak frankly? For Vasubandhu,\napparently, the presence of a contradiction between two statements\nfrom the Buddha is one key. The Buddha cannot have literally meant\nboth that there was no living being (satva)\nand that living beings (satva) came into being in a\nparticular bodily form. A similar contradiction is brought to bear in\nthe discussion with the Personalists, during their argument over the\nfunctionality of memory in the absence of an enduring self. There,\nVasubandhu cites a scripture in which the Buddha says that whoever\nclaims to remember past lives is only remembering past aggregates in\nhis own continuum—a quote which vitiates the Personalists’\ncitation of the Buddha having said of his own past life, “I was\nsuch-and-such a person, with such-and-such a form.” \nTo return to the case at hand from the Twenty Verses\nCommentary, although Vasubandhu does not indicate a direct\ncontradiction in the Buddha’s words, he does explain (3) what he\ntakes to be the truth behind the Buddha’s statements about the\n“sense bases of physical form, and so on.” The literal\nmeaning of the twelve sense bases, recall, is simply the listing of\nthe six sensory organs and their six sensory objects. The truth behind\nthis, for Vasubandhu, is the Yogācāra causal story, which\ntells how conscious events arise from karmic seeds within the\nmind’s own continuum. Each consciousness comes into being with a\nparticular subject/object appearance imprinted upon it by its karmic\nseed. There are no subjects and no objects, only “dual”\nappearances. It is this causal story that was the “special\nintention”—the real truth—behind the Buddha’s\nwords affirming the sense bases. Of course, the Yogācāra\ncausal story denies the functionality of the senses, and so the\n“special intention” is a direct contradiction of the\nliteral meaning of the sense bases. \nIn response to this supposed explanation, the opponent asks for the\nBuddha’s justification for speaking in this way, and (4)\nVasubandhu provides two separate reasons, targeted at two different\nlevels of listeners. For students who do not yet understand the truth\nof appearance-only, the Buddha taught the sense bases in order to help\nthem to understand the absence of self in persons. This seems to\ncohere with Vasubandhu’s Treasury argument that uses\nthe sense bases as a way to explain away the apparent self. For\nstudents who do understand the truth of appearance-only, the\ndoctrine of the sense bases is useful for helping them to\nunderstand the absence of self in the elements—that is, in the\nsense bases\n themselves.[33]\n Thus, for Vasubandhu, the Buddha’s teachings are still useful,\neven when they are understood to have been spoken from a provisional\nstandpoint. \nPerhaps this point can be extended still further. For Vasubandhu,\nwhile scriptures are always valid sources of knowledge, to excavate\ntheir meaning often requires in-depth, sophisticated, philosophical\nreasoning. We find Vasubandhu mocking his opponents, in one place in\nthe Treasury, for understanding “the words”\nrather than “the meaning” of a scriptural passage in\nquestion. (204.1) Vasubandhu often argues against his opponents’\noverly literal interpretations of scripture as a crucial part of his\nargument against their philosophical positions. When he turns to a\nformal analysis of expository method and theory, Vasubandhu defends\nthis broad, rationalist approach to scripture. \nIn the Proper Mode of Exposition, Vasubandhu defends the\nlegitimacy of the Mahāyāna Sūtras against a\n“Śrāvaka” opponent, and defends their\nfigurative, Yogācāra interpretation against a\nMādhyamika opponent. Cabezon (1992) usefully summarizes\nVasubandhu’s arguments here in three general categories:\nArguments based on the structure of the canon; arguments based on\ndoctrinal contents; and arguments based upon “intercanonical\ncriteria for authenticity.” As we have seen in his\nTreasury and Twenty Verses arguments, Vasubandhu\nargues that naïvely to require that all scriptures be interpreted\nliterally is to insist that the Buddha repeatedly contradicted\nhimself. He cites many internal references to lost or unknown texts,\nand argues that this shows that no lineage or school can claim to have\na complete canon. Unlike his Mādhyamika opponents, Vasubandhu\nbelieves that the Mahāyāna Sūtras must be read under a\n“special intention,” so as to prevent the danger of\nnihilism. As Cabezon writes, both the Śrāvaka and Madhyamaka\nposition share an over-emphasis on literal readings.\nVasubandhu’s emphasis on “correct exegesis” (a\nliteral translation of Vyākhyāyukti) shows the\nYogācāra to be the school of greatest hermeneutical subtlety\nand sophistication. \nThe Twenty Verses is Vasubandhu’s most readable, and\nevidently analytic, philosophical text, and it has consequently drawn\na significant degree of modern scholarly\n attention.[34]\n It begins with a simple statement, which Vasubandhu defends\nthroughout the brief text and commentary: “Everything in the\nthree realms is only appearance\n (vijñaptimātra).”[35]\n The three realms are the three states into which Buddhists believe\nliving beings may be reborn. For all beings except for Buddhas and\nadvanced bodhisattvas, the three realms make up the universe.\nVasubandhu glosses this statement with citations from scripture that\nmake it clear that he means to say that there no things\n(artha), only minds (citta) and mental qualities\n(caitta). He says that the experience of the three realms is\nlike the appearance of hairs in front of someone with eye disease. It\nis the experience of something that does not exist as it appears.\nAlthough the term has a history of controversy among interpreters of\nYogācāra, it seems safe to say that the Twenty\nVerses defends at least some form of idealism. (See the section\non the controversy over Vasubandhu as idealist.) \nAfter stating his thesis that everything is “only\napparent,” Vasubandhu immediately voices a potential\ncounter-argument, which consists in four reasons that the three realms\nbeing appearance only is impossible: First and second, why are things\nrestricted to specific places and times, respectively? Apparent\nobjects can appear anywhere, at any time. Third, why do beings in a\ngiven place and time experience the same objects, and not different\nobjects according to their distinct continua? And fourth, why do\nobjects perform causal functions in the real world, when merely\napparent mental objects do not? \nThese objections aim to prove the impossibility that the world is\nmerely apparent by arguing that the elements of ordinary experience\nbehave in ways that what is merely apparent does not. Vasubandhu sets\nup, and meets, these objections in order to prove the possibility, and\nhence the viability of the theory, that everything in experience is\nappearance only. He shows, essentially, that the objector has a narrow\nview of what is possible for merely apparent things; appearances are\nnot necessarily limited in the ways the objector thinks. \nNotice that it is not incumbent upon Vasubandhu here to prove that\nall instances of the merely apparent transcend the\nlimitations assumed by the objector. He has not set up this objection\nin order to try to prove, absurdly, that all mental images,\nfor instance, are spatially restricted, or that all mere\nappearances perform observable causal functions in the real world. On\nthe contrary, one upshot of the recognition that things are appearance\nonly will be that things do not have the cause-and-effect structure\nthat we ordinarily take them to have. In any event, the positive\nargument that ordinary experience is, in fact, illusory, comes later\nand takes the form of an argument to the best explanation. Before an\nexplanation can be the best, though, it must be a possibility. So\nhere, all Vasubandhu must do to counter these initial objections is\nprovide, for each, a single example of a mental event that exemplifies\nthe behavior that the objector claims is only available to physical\n objects.[36] \nTo defeat the objections that mental objects are not restricted in\nspace and time, Vasubandhu provides the counterexample that in dreams\nobjects often appear to exist in one place and time, as they do in\nordinary waking reality. In a dream, I can be looking at shells on a\nbeach on Long Island, during the summer of my eighth year. It is only\nupon waking that I come to realize that the dream objects (the shells,\nthe beach) were only mental fabrications, temporally dislocated, with\nno spatial reality. Thus, what is merely apparent can\nsometimes have the character of appearing in a particular place and\ntime. To say they do not is to misremember the\n experience.[37] \nNext, to defeat the objection that unlike ordinary physical objects,\nmerely apparent objects are not intersubjectively shared by different\nbeings, Vasubandhu provides the counterexample that in hell, demonic\nentities appear to torment groups of hell beings. This is a case of a\nshared hallucination. When the objector wonders why the demons might\nnot in fact be real, Vasubandhu appeals to karma theory: Any being\nwith sufficient merit—sufficient “good\nkarma”—to generate a body capable of withstanding the\npainful fires of hell would never be born into hell in the first\nplace. Any creature in hell that is not suffering must be an\napparition generated by the negative karma of the tormented. \nFinally, to defeat the objection that merely apparent objects do not\nproduce functional causal results, Vasubandhu provides the memorable\ncounterexample of a wet dream, in which an evident, physical result is\nproduced by an imagined sexual encounter with a nonexistent lover. \nThe initial objection to the mere possibility of the “appearance\nonly” theory quelled, Vasubandhu turns to his main positive\nproof. This consists in a systematic evaluation of every possible\naccount of sensory objects as physical, which ultimately leads\nVasubandhu to conclude that no account of physicality makes more\nsense, or is more parsimonious, than the theory that it is appearance\nonly. \nBefore turning to Vasubandhu’s treatment of physics, it is worth\nstopping to note the crucial importance that Buddhist karma theory\nplays in Vasubandhu’s argument, overall. First, the proof of\nshared hallucinations in hell depends upon the particulars of the\nBuddhist belief in the hells. Of course, we might have believed in\nshared hallucinations even without believing in karma. But the\ntormenters in hell play an important, double role in\nVasubandhu’s argument. He has the objector raise the question\nagain, and suggest as a last-ditch effort that perhaps, the tormenters\nare physical entities generated and controlled by the karmic energies\nof the tormented. At this, Vasubandhu challenges his objector: If\nyou’re willing to admit that karma generates physical entities,\nand makes them move around (pick up swords and saws, etc.), so that\nthey might create painful results in the mental streams of the\ntormented, why not just eliminate the physical? Isn’t it simpler\nto say that the mind generates mental images that torment the\n mind?[38]\n This a crucial question, because it resonates beyond hell beings,\nacross Buddhist karmic theory. \nIn the Treasury of the Abhidharma, Vasubandhu expressed the\nwidely-held Buddhist view that in addition to causing beings’\nparticular rebirths, karma also shapes the realms into which beings\nare reborn and the non-sentient contents of those realms. Such a\nbelief provides Indian religions with answers to questions often\nthought unanswerable by western theisms, such as why the mudslide took\nout my neighbor’s house, but not mine. But this view of karmic\ncausality requires that the physical causes of positive or negative\nexperiences are linked back to our intentional acts. (For more on the\ncontinuity problems associated with karmic causality, see the\ndiscussion of the disproof of invisible physicality.) Vasubandhu does\nnot say so explicitly, but if it is easier to imagine the causes of a\nmind-only hell demon than a physical one, it should also be easier to\nimagine the causes of a mind-only mudslide—assuming that both\nare generated as a karmic repercussion for the beings that encounter\nthem. The background assumption that any physical world must be\nsubject to karma, therefore places the realist on the defensive from\nthe start. Can the external realist adduce a theory intellectually\nsatisfying enough to counter Vasubandhu’s suggestion that we\nthrow up our hands and admit that what appears to be out there is only\nin our minds? \nIt is in response to this that the objector cites scripture,\nsaying that the Buddha did after all, teach of the sense bases, saying\nthat eyes perceive physical forms, and so on. As discussed above,\nVasubandhu reinterprets this scripture as having a “special\nintention” (abhiprāya). (See the section\nconcerning scriptures.) The Buddha did not intend to affirm the\nultimate reality of such entities. Yet the objector is not satisfied\nwith Vasubandhu’s alternate reading of the Buddha’s words.\nIn order to doubt such an explicit, repeated, statement, Vasubandhu\nneeds to prove that it could not be interpreted directly.\nEven if the appearance-only world is possible, and even if it accounts\nbetter for karmic causality than the physical world, a direct reading\nof scripture is still supported, unless and until its doctrines are\nshown to be internally inconsistent. \nIn order to disprove the possibility of external objects, Vasubandhu\ndelves into the atomic theory of the Kashimiri Vaibhāṣikas\nas well as that of the (“orthodox”/Hindu)\n Vaiśeṣikas.[39]\n The purpose here is to undermine every possible theory that might\naccount for perception as caused by non-mental entities.\nVasubandhu’s argument at this stage is entirely based in\nmereology—the study of the relations between parts and wholes.\nHe argues first that atomism—the view that things are ultimately\nmade up of parts that are themselves partless—cannot work. Then,\nhe argues that any reasonable explanation of objects of perception\nmust be atomic, by arguing that the alternative—an\nextended, partless whole—is incoherent. Vasubandhu takes it that\ntogether, these conclusions prove that external objects must be unreal\nappearances. \nI can only summarize Vasubandhu’s sophisticated mereological\narguments. He begins with the assertion that anything that serves as a\nsensory object must be a whole made up of basic parts, a bare\nmultiplicity of basic parts, or an aggregate. But none of these can\nwork. A whole made up of parts is rejected on the grounds that things\nare not perceived over and above their parts. This is a well-developed\nBuddhist Ābhidharmika view, which coheres with the rejection of a\nself over and above the aggregates. A bare multiplicity of partless\nparts is rejected on the grounds that separate atoms are not perceived\nseparately. Thus the only sensible option is a grouping of\nparts—an aggregate—that somehow becomes perceptible by\nbeing joined together. \nThe combination of partless entities, however, is conceptually\nimpossible. Vasubandhu points out that if they if they combine on one\n“side” with one atom and another “side” with\nanother—those “sides” are parts. The opponent must\naccount for the relation between those parts and the whole, and we are\nbrought back to the beginning. Furthermore, if they are infinitesimal,\nthey cannot be combined into larger objects. \nIt is proposed, instead, that perhaps a partless entity may be\nextended in space, and so perceived. But perception is generated by\ncontact between a sensory organ and its object. This requires the\nobject to put up some kind of resistance. But if a thing has no parts,\nthen its near side is its far side, which means that to be adjacent to\nit is to have passed it by. Partless atoms are therefore logically\nincapable of providing the resistance that is definitive of\nphysicality and the basis for sensory contact (Vasubandhu says that\nthey cannot produce light on one side and shade on the other). This\nconfirms that entities must be combined into larger groupings in order\nto be functional and perceptible, which has already been shown\nimpossible. \nIf atoms and extended partless entities are impossible, so also are\nunitary sensory objects. Vasubandhu is well practiced in the\nAbhidharma arguments reducing apparent wholes to their composite\nentities. Suppose we say I see something that has both blue and yellow\nin it. How, if it is one unitary thing, can I see these two colors at\ndifferent points? What makes one point in an object different from\nanother point, if the object is of a single nature? This is clearly\nparallel to the argument against Īśvara as a single cause of\nall things. A similar case is movement across an extended thing. As\nwith a partless atom, to step on the near side of a partless extended\nsingular entity would be to step on its far side, too. So there can be\nno gradual movement across a singular entity. As Vasubandhu concludes,\none cannot but derive the need for partless, atomic units from such\nreasoning. But partless atomic units are imperceptible. So, perception\nis impossible; apparently perceived objects are only apparent. \nThe main part of his argument settled, Vasubandhu entertains another\nset of counterarguments, which are the charges of solipsism and moral\nnihilism: How, the internal objector asks, can beings interact with\none another? What is the karmic benefit of helping or harming, when we\nare all merely apparent beings? Vasubandhu’s direct, candid\nresponse to these challenges may be viewed as a failure of\nimagination, or a surprising willingness to bite the bullet of\nanti-realism. Mental streams, he says, interact in essentially the\nsame way as we imagine physical objects to interact. Minds affect\nminds directly. When you speak to me, and I hear you, we ordinarily\nthink that your mind causes your mouth to produce sounds that my ears\npick up and transform into mental events in my mind. Vasubandhu takes\nOccam’s razor to this account and says that—given that we\nhave no sensible account of physicality, let alone mental causation of\na physical event and physical causation of a mental event—it\nmakes more sense if we eliminate everything but the evident\ncause and the result: Your mind and mine. \nNote that Vasubandhu is not saying that nothing in our appearances\nexists; he is saying, on the contrary, that mere appearances bear all\nthe reality that we need for full intersubjectivity and moral\nresponsibility. It seems worth noting in this context that something\nsimilar to Vasubandhu’s option just may be the only option\navailable for a modern physicalist who believes that human minds are\nconstituted by, or out of, neurons. Human persons, for such a modern,\ndo not exist as we imagine them to, and are not causally constituted\nin ways that we can intuit or even comprehend, except vaguely. Does\nthis mean that we must advert to moral nihilism or solipsism?\nVasubandhu’s alternative is to affirm our pragmatic acceptance\nof our own, and others’ experiences and causal responsibilities,\nand not to imagine that we must await an account of physicality before\ntrusting the effectiveness of our mental, moral, causality. Read in\nthis way, Vasubandhu seems much closer to Madhyamaka philosophy than\nis ordinarily assumed; see Nagao (1991). \nVasubandhu did the work of defending the controversial,\nYogācāra thesis of appearance-only\n(vijñaptimātra) in his Twenty Verses. In\nhis short, poetic works the Thirty Verses and the Three\nNatures Exposition, he does not entertain\n objections.[40]\n Instead, he draws together the basic doctrinal and conceptual\nvocabulary of the Yogācāra tradition and forms an elegant,\ncoherent system. The Thirty Verses includes a complete\ntreatment of the Buddhist path from a Yogācāra perspective.\nIn order to understand Vasubandhu’s contribution in this text,\nit would be necessary to place it against the wide backdrop of\nprevious Yogācāra doctrine. This scholarly work is ongoing.\nHere, let us focus instead on introducing the basics of the intricate\ndoctrinal structure formulated in the Three Natures\nExposition. \nThe Three Natures Exposition takes as its topic, and its\ntitle, the three natures of reality from a Yogācāra\nperspective: These are the fabricated nature\n(parikalpita-svabhāva), the dependent nature\n(paratantra-svabhāva) and the perfected nature\n(pariniṣpanna-svabhāva). In Yogācāra\nmetaphysics, things no longer have only one nature, one\nsvabhāva; rather, things have three different, if\ninterconnected, natures. We may note immediately how fundamentally\nthis differs from the Treasury, in which the apparent purpose\nis, at all times, to determine the singular nature of each entity\n(dharma). In that context, to discover that an entity must be\nadmitted to have more than one, distinct nature, would be to discover\nthat that entity is unreal. Something that changes, for instance, is\ninternally inconsistent because of exhibiting multiple natures.\nVasubandhu employs exactly such arguments to deny the ultimate reality\nof many specific entities (dharma) in the Treasury.\nSuch entities, he says, are unreal; like a “self,” they\nare only conceptual fabrications (parikalpita). \nOne of the basic distinguishing features of Great Vehicle\n(Mahāyāna) metaphysics is the affirmation that not only the\nperson, but all entities (dharma) are empty of a\n“self” or an inherent nature (svabhāva).\nThat means, in the terms laid out in the Treasury, that\nall dharmas are only conceptual fabrications. But that is not\nthe only way of looking at things. To say that all things have\nthree inherent natures is not to take back the Great\nVehicle’s denial of inherent natures, but rather to explain it.\nIt is to say that, what we ordinarily take to be a thing’s\nindividual character or identity is best understood from three angles,\nso as to explode its unity. The first nature is the fabricated nature,\nwhich is the thing as it appears to be. Of course, to use this term is\nto indicate the acceptance that things do not really exist the way\nthey appear. This is a thing’s nature as it might be defined and\nexplained in ordinary Abhidharma philosophy, but with the added\nproviso that we all know that this is not really how things work. The\nsecond nature is the dependent nature, which Vasubandhu defines as the\ncausal process of the thing’s fabrication, the causal\nstory that brings about the thing’s apparent nature. The third\nnature, finally, is the emptiness of the first nature—the\nfact that it is unreal, that it does not exist as it\nappears. \nLet’s take the most important example, for Buddhists, of a thing\nthat appears real but has no nature: the self. With this as our\nexample of something mistakenly thought to have a nature\n(svabhāva), we may run through its three\nnatures. The self as it appears is just my self. I seem to be here, as\na living being, typing on a keyboard, thinking thoughts. That is the\nfirst nature. The second nature is the causal story that brings about\nthis seeming self, which is the cycle of dependent origination. We\nmight appeal to the standard Abhidharma causal story, and say that the\ntwelve sense bases or the five aggregates, causally conjoined, bring\nabout the conceptually-fabricated self. In the Yogācāra,\nthis causal story is entirely mental, of course, so we cannot appeal\nto the sense bases themselves as the real cause. Rather, the sense\nbases only appear to be there due to karmic conditioning in\nmy mental stream. For this reason, the second nature should instead be\nsaid to be the causal series according to which the mental seeds\nplanted by previous deeds ripen into the appearance of the sense\nbases, so that I think I am perceiving things—which, in turn,\nmakes me think I have a self. Finally, the third nature is the\nnon-existence of the self, the fact that it does not exist where it\nappears. Of course, if there was a real self, I could not have\nprovided my explanation of how it comes to appear to be there. In\nVasubandhu’s telling, the three natures are all one reality\nviewed from three distinct angles. They are the appearance, the\nprocess, and the emptiness of that same apparent entity. \nWith this in mind, we can read the opening verses of the Three\nNatures Exposition: \n1. Fabricated, dependent and perfected: So the wise understand, in\ndepth, the three natures. \n2. What appears is the dependent. How it appears is the fabricated.\nBecause of being dependent on conditions. Because of being only\nfabrication. \n3. The eternal non-existence of the appearance as it is appears: That\nis known to be the perfected nature, because of being always the\nsame. \n4. What appears there? The unreal fabrication. How does it appear? As\na dual self. What is its nonexistence? That by which the nondual\nreality is\n there.[41] \nThese verses emphasize the crystalline, internal structure to the\nthree natures. “What appears” is one nature (the\ndependent), whereas “how it appears” is the fabricated.\n“The eternal non-existence of the appearance as it\nappears” is the perfected. These are ways of talking of the same\nentity, or event, from different perspectives. Also evident here is\nthe crucial Yogācāra concept of “duality.” The\nfabricated is said to appear as a “dual self,” whereas\nreality (dharmatā) is nondual. Since, as we have seen\nabove, Vasubandhu believes in the selflessness of all dharmas, the\n“dual self” is the false appearance of a self that is\nattributed to any entity. Things and selves mistakenly appear\n“dual.” What does this mean? \nThe twosome denied by the denial of “duality” has many\ninterpretations across Yogācāra thought, but for Vasubandhu\nthe most important kinds of duality are conceptual duality\nand perceptual\n duality.[42]\n Conceptual duality is the bifurcation of the universe that appears\nnecessary in the formation of any concept. When we say of any given\nthing that it is “physical,” we are effectively saying, at\nthe same time, that all things are either “physical” or\n“not physical.” We create a “duality”\naccording to which we may understand all things as falling into either\none or the other category. This is what it is to define something, and\nto ascribe it its characteristic nature (svabhāva). This\nis why every “self” is “dual.” To say\nsomething is what it is imposes a duality upon the world. And, given\nthat the world is in causal flux and does not accord with any\nconceptual construct, every duality imposes a false construct upon the\nworld. To illuminate this with regard to the person, when I say that\n“I” exist, I am dividing the universe into\n“self” and “other”—me and not-me. Since,\nfor Buddhists, the self is unreal, this is a mistaken imposition, and\nof course many ignorant, selfish actions follow from this fundamental\nconceptual error. \nIn addition, but closely related to conceptual duality, is\nperceptual duality. This is the distinction between sensory\norgans and their objects that appears in perception. When I see a\ntree, I have the immediate impression that there is a distinction\nbetween that tree, which I see, and my eye organs, which see the tree.\nI take it that my eyes are “grasping” the tree, and\nfurthermore I understand that the eyes (my eyes) are part of me,\nwhereas the tree is not part of me. The same is true of all of the\nsensory organs and their objects. The Abhidharma system calls the\nsensory organs the “internal” sense bases, and the sensory\nobjects the “external” ones. It is the combination of the\n“internal” sense bases upon which I impose the false\nconstruction of self. Thus perception provides the basis for the\nconceptual distinction between self and other. \nFor Yogācāra Buddhists, however, sense perception is just as\nfalse a “duality” as are false conceptual constructions.\nGiven that the external world must be only mind, the sensory\nexperience that we have of a world “out there” is only a\nfigment of our imagination. The self/other distinction implicit in\nperception is as much a false imposition as is the self/other\ndistinction implicit in the concept, “self.” Perception,\nlike conceptualization, is only a matter of the mind generating\n“dual” images. As counterintuitive as this sounds, it may\nbe clarified by analogy to the idea of a multi-player virtual reality\ngame. In a shared virtual reality experience, the first thing the\ncomputer system must be able to track is where, objectively,\neverything is (where the various players are, where the castle with\nthe hidden jewels is, where the dragon is hiding, etc.). Then, when\nany new player logs in, the system can place that player somewhere in\nthe multi-dimensional, virtual world. At that point, the computer must\ngenerate a sensory perspective for that individual. Immediately that\nperson experiences herself to exist in a world of a certain kind, with\ncertain abilities to move around, and fight, and so on. But this is\nonly a trick of the software. The world is unreal, and so is the\nplayer’s subjective perspective on that world. \nFor the Yogācāra, our sensory experience is something like\nthis. We are all only mental, and so the apparent physicalities that\nintervene between us are merely false constructions of our deluded\nminds. Furthermore, the physical body that we take ourselves to have,\nas we negotiate the world, making use of our senses, is also not\nthere. Both external and internal realities are mistaken to the degree\nthat we see them as “two” and not “nondual”\nconstructions arising out of a single mental stream. \nVasubandhu’s clearest, most evocative, and most famous\nexplanation of the three natures appears later on, when they are\nanalogized to a magician’s production of an illusion of an\nelephant, using a piece of wood and a magical spell: \n27. It is just as [something] made into a magical illusion with the\npower of an incantation (mantra) appears as the self of an\nelephant. A mere appearance (ākāramātra) is\nthere, but the elephant does not exist at all. \n28. The fabricated nature is the elephant; the dependent is its\nappearance (ākṛti); and the nonexistence of an\nelephant there is the perfected. \n29. In the same way, the fabrication of what does not exist appears as\nthe self of duality from the root mind. The duality is utterly\nnonexistent. A mere appearance (ākṛtimātraka)\nis there. \n30. The root-consciousness is like the incantation. Suchness\n(tathatā) is understood to be like the piece of wood.\nConstruction (vikalpa) should be accepted to be like the\nappearance of the elephant. The duality is like the\n elephant.[43] \nNotice the two different elements here in the ending of Verse 30: The\n“appearance of the elephant” is\n“construction,” that is, the ongoing process of\nimagination that arises from the karmic causal stream. The real\nproblem, though, “duality,” the dangerous, false\ndistinction between self and other, is analogized to the illusory\nelephant itself. If I am at a magic show, I should expect to see the\n“appearance of an elephant.” That will make the show worth\nattending. But if I am not a fool, I will not imagine myself to\nactually see an elephant. That would be to construct\nduality. For Vasubandhu, this is a crucial distinction. The basic\nproblem for living beings in his view is not that we\nexperience an illusory world; the problem is that we are\nfooled into accepting the reality of our perceptions and our\nconcepts. Once we no longer believe, once we see the falsity of the\nillusion, the illusion goes away and we can come to experience the\ntruth that lies behind the illusion—the ineffable\n“suchness” (tathatā), the piece of wood. \nLet us posit that metaphysical idealism need not be the\ncounterintuitive view that all that exists is, simply, mental. To call\na view idealist it is sufficient merely that it hold that everything\nis dependent upon mind—a mind, or many minds. Idealists\nhold that the natures or forms of things are mind-dependent. Of\ncourse, such dependence is, in itself, counterintuitive, given that we\ngenerally take the physical world to have existence independent of\nminds. Contemporary prevailing wisdom holds that the direction of\ncausal dependence goes in the opposite direction; the physical world\nin fact generates and sustains minds (using neurons to do so).\nIdealism says that ideas, or minds, are in one way or other behind, or\nprior to, all other forms of existence. \nGiven this definition, is Vasubandhu, the author of the Twenty\nVerses and the Thirty Verses and probably the Three\nNatures Exposition, a metaphysical idealist? At first blush, it\nseems quite sensible to say that he is. The evident purpose of the\nTwenty Verses is to argue that the core background\nassumptions of Mahāyāna Buddhism (especially its views on\nkarma) suggest the idealistic thesis that is asserted in the\ntext’s opening: “In the Great Vehicle, the threefold world\nis only\n appearance.”[44]\n Vasubandhu argues throughout the Twenty Verses that whatever\naspects of the world appear to be independent of mind, they are better\nexplained as mental constructions. What that means is, apparently,\nthat not only is Vasubandhu an idealist in the sense that he believes\nthat everything in experience is dependent upon mind, but he also\nbelieves that everything simply is mind. This is the radical\n“mind only” (cittamātra) position that he\nbelieves is necessitated by adherence to a Mahāyāna\nworldview. \nThings are not quite this simple, however. First, it is important to\nnote two levels to Vasubandhu’s “idealism.” The\nfirst level points to an analysis of what appears in perception.\nVasubandhu says that everything that we ordinarily ascribe existence\nin the world—such as a self or an object—is actually only\nmental. Tables and nebulae and eyes are mental fabrications that have\nno existence apart from their “shape”\n(ākāra), the way they\n appear.[45]\n The second level points to the causal story that brings about such\nappearances. Along with other Yogācārins, Vasubandhu argues\nthat that causal story too is only mental. Perception, in the\nform of active sensory and mental consciousnesses, is caused by the\n“storehouse consciousness”\n(ālayavijñāna), which stores, in mental\nform, the seeds of all of our future experiences. The storehouse is\nconstantly replenished, because new “seeds”\n(bīja) are created every time we enact a morally\nsignificant action (karma). \nIt is mental causation, then, that brings about our mental\nexperiences. It is this second level, then, that confirms Vasubandhu\nas an idealist. Not only the reality that we inhabit (which we\nordinarily think of as at least partly non-mental), but also the\ncausal supports upon which such a reality depends, are only\nmental. Even if the storehouse consciousnesses of living beings\nprovided ongoing support to a real, physical world, we would\nstill want to call that view “idealism” for its\ninsistence on the causal priority of the mental. Since Vasubandhu does\nnot say as much, but instead says that everything that is created by\nminds is itself mental, we might say that in addition to a causal\nidealism, Vasubandhu’s is a universal, ontological idealism. \nBehind both of these levels, however, there is an important sense in\nwhich Vasubandhu is not really an idealist. Like all\nMahāyāna Buddhists, Vasubandhu believes that whatever can be\nstated in language is only conventional, and therefore, from an\nultimate perspective, it is mistaken. Ultimate reality is an\ninconceivable “thusness” (tathatā) that is\nperceived and known only by enlightened beings. Ultimately, therefore,\nthe idea of “mind” is just as mistaken as are ordinary\n“external objects.” For this reason, we can say that\nVasubandhu is an idealist, but only in the realm of conventions.\nUltimately, he affirms ineffability. \nLevels of Analysis of Vasubandhu \nIt is extremely important to keep these levels apart, in order to\nprevent Vasubandhu from committing an evident self-contradiction. At\nthe end of his commentary to verse 10 of the Twenty Verses,\nVasubandhu imagines an interlocutor challenging the appearance-only\nview by saying that if no dharmas exist at all, then so also\nappearance-only doesn’t exist. How, then, can it be established?\nThis charge of self-referential incoherence is faced by anti-realists\nof all stripes, and it is familiar to Buddhist philosophers from\nNāgārjuna’s Vīgrahavyāvartanī.\n(See the entry on\n Nāgārjuna\n in this encyclopedia.) Vasubandhu’s reply in the Twenty\nVerses Commentary is that appearance-only does not mean the\nnonexistence of dharmas. It only means the absence of a nature\n(svabhāva) that is falsely attributed to a constructed\nself (kalpitātmanā), and Vasubandhu is quick to say\nthat when one establishes appearance-only, appearance-only must\nalso be understood to be itself a construction, without a\nself. Otherwise, there would be something other than an appearance,\nwhich would by definition contradict appearance-only. All there is, is\nappearance, and everything that appears is a false construction of\nself. \nWe can take two important lessons from this. First,\nrepresentation-only cannot be the ultimate truth. If Vasubandhu were\naffirming the ultimate reality of the “mind-only” causal\nstory that brings about appearances, or the appearances themselves\n(levels 2 and 1, respectively), then he would surely have said so in\nresponse to the charge of self-referential, nihilistic incoherence.\nInstead, his argument adverts to another level for ultimate reality.\nMadhyamaka critics of Yogācāra have made much of the notion\nthat the latter have reified the mind and made it a new\n “ultimate.”[46]\n Yet Vasubandhu’s position is clearly intended to elude such a\ncritique. \nSecond, for Vasubandhu the lack of a self-nature\n(svabhāva) just is, precisely, what he means by\n“appearance-only.” This is also contrary to a common\nunderstanding of Yogācāra which arises from the equation of\n“appearance-only” with “mind-only.” This\nequation is not, technically, a mistake in the case of Vasubandhu. He\nsays, specifically, that “mind” (citta) and\n“appearance” (vijñapti) are synonyms. The\nmistake is what we moderns tend to think, based on a background\nassumption of mind/matter Cartesian dualism—namely, that the\nexpression “mind only” is used to affirm the reality of\nthe mental at the expense of the physical. Here, reality is certainly\nnot physical, but that is not Vasubandhu’s point. His point is\nto equate the lack of independent nature (svabhāva) with\nthe product of mental construction. This is a simple statement of\nidealism, as mentioned above: Everything that exists must either have\nindependent existence, or be dependent upon mind, a mental\nconstruction; and since, for the Great Vehicle, nothing has\nindependent existence, everything is only a mental construction. What\nit means to be “mind only,” then, is not simply to be made\nof mental stuff rather than physical stuff. It is to be a false\nconstruction by a deluded mind. Again, we can see that there is no\npossibility that Vasubandhu is talking about the\n“ultimate” here. \nThese points, and the above table, may clarify some of the\ndifficulties in the ongoing, contentious debates over whether\nVasubandhu and other Yogācārins should be classified as\nidealists or mystics. A quarter century ago, Thomas A. Kochumuttom\n(1982) argued quite powerfully and sensibly for his time that\nVasubandhu should not be called an idealist, but he was\narguing primarily against authors such as Theodore Stcherbatsky and S.\nN. Dasgupta, about whom he wrote (200): \nOne can appreciate Kochumuttom’s frustration. Vasubandhu is\ncautious not to conflate a description of perceived entities as\nreducible to only mind (Level 1) with a description of the ineffable\nultimate reality (Level 3). Vasubandhu explicitly denies that\n“mind” has ultimate reality. He is not a Hegelian\nidealist. \nBut not all idealists are Hegelian, absolute idealists. Among\nidealisms, Vasubandhu’s is more closely aligned with\nKant’s, in that both assert that the objects of our experience\nare only representations, while both also affirm the reality of\nunknowable things in themselves (Ding an\n sich).[47]\n Kochumuttom was aware of this, and even in the course of his extended\nargument against using the term “idealism” for Vasubandhu,\nhe allowed that the term might be appropriate if understood in this\nway: \nIs the term “idealism” acceptable for the view that, even\nif nothing expressible in language has ultimate reality, mental events\nare still more real than physical events, which do not have\neven conventional reality? Perhaps “conventionalist\nidealism” would be a good term for this view, but surely it sits\nsquarely within the range of idealisms. To say, with emphasis, as some\ndo, that this view is not idealism, may be to privilege a\nnarrow understanding of the term. \nIn addition, the issue may be more than semantic. It will strike some\nas overstating the case to say, as Kochumuttom does, that the fact\nthat everything within perception is only mind “by no means\nimplies that there is nothing apart from ideas or\nconsciousness.” Vasubandhu’s arguments in the Twenty\nVerses are intended to exclude the possibility of anything at all\nthat may be coherently asserted to be\n non-mental.[48]\n So the doctrine of appearance-only does imply that there is\nnothing apart from ideas or consciousness, at least, as far as logic\nand implications are allowed to go. The only exceptions would be\nthings about which we can say nothing. So what could allow us to say\nabout them that they are\n exceptions?[49] \nWhether or not one wants to use the word “idealism” for\nVasubandhu thus depends to a large degree upon just how strongly one\nwants to lean upon the idea that idealists must affirm the\nultimate reality of mind. The main arguments that remain\nagainst viewing Vasubandhu as an idealist, exemplified prominently\ntoday by Dan Lusthaus, emphasize this idea. Given that many Buddhists\nin India, Tibet and East Asia have understood the Yogācāra\nto be affirming the ultimate reality of the mental, the denial of such\na view on Vasubandhu’s behalf is an important and useful\ncorrective. Lusthaus believes that Vasubandhu is not a\n“metaphysical idealist” or an “ontological\nidealist” but rather an “epistemological idealist,”\nmeaning that Vasubandhu is concerned only about awareness and its\ncontents, and is not in the business of affirming or denying anything\nabout ultimate reality. For this reason, Lusthaus refers to\nYogācāra as\n “phenomenology.”[50] \nA final complaint is that the use of the term “idealism”\nis anachronistic or for some other reason inappropriate in its\napplication to pre-modern India. Kochummutom’s point that the\nterm encompasses too much is well taken. It is one thing (perhaps\nalready stretching the meaning) to apply the term\n“idealism,” as R.P. Srivastava (1973) does, to modern\nthinkers whose views have been influenced by European idealists, such\nas Aurobindo, Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan. But it is anachronistic\nif we are to impose upon Vasubandhu the modern associations and\nbaggage that come along with the term, which would include an advocacy\nof private, personal, sacred, “religious experience.”\nVasubandhu may be an idealist, in a strict sense, but he is not what\n20th century religious studies textbooks call a\n“mystic philosopher.” Vasubandhu does not, generally,\nappeal to his own, individual personal experience as evidence or\nconfirmation of his positions. On the contrary, Vasubandhu repeatedly\nemploys reasoning to cast doubts upon the apparent realities evident\nthrough perception, whether external or internal. This is, perhaps, a\nreason to avoid describing Vasubandhu as a\n“phenomenologist.” His work does not take the direct\nexamination of “experience” as its theme, but, rather, it\ndraws upon scripture and rational argumentation for its critiques of\nthe available accounts of reality.","contact.mail":"jcgold@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"}]
