[{"date.published":"2019-03-29","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-change/","author1":"Tze-Ki Hon","entry":"chinese-change","body.text":"\n\n\nThis article discusses the Chinese philosophy of change based on the\nYijing (I Ching, Book of Changes). A canonized\nConfucian classic, the Yijing is a composite text consisting\nof three distinct layers. Its first layer is comprised by the 8\ntrigrams and 64 hexagrams allegedly created by the mythical figure, Fu\nXi (see the images of trigrams and hexagrams in\n Appendixes 1 and 2).\n Its second layer are the hexagram statements and line statements\nallegedly written by King Wen and the Duke of Zhou during the\n11th century BCE (see the names of the 64 hexagrams in\n Appendix 3).\n Its third layer incorporates seven pieces of writings composed from\n5th to 2nd century BCE. Divided into ten\nsegments (hence, the name “Ten Wings”), the authors of\nthese writings used the hexagrams to discuss cosmic patterns, the\nrelations between humanity and nature, and the complexity of human\nlife (see the list of the “Ten Wings” in\n Appendix 4).\n By 125 BCE, these three textual layers were combined to form what we\nnow call the Yijing. For a detailed account of the textual\nhistory of Yijing, see Nylan 2001: 202–52; Redmond and\nHon 2014: 1–157; Richard Smith 2012: 1–47.\n\n\nUnderlying the Yijing philosophy of change is the notion that\nthe cosmos is an organismic process without beginning or end. As a\nprocess, the cosmos resembles a great flow in which “all of the\nparts of the entire cosmos belong to one organic whole” and all\nthe parts “interact as participants in one spontaneously\nself-generating process” (Tu 1985: 35). As such, there are three\ncharacteristics of this great flow: continuity, wholeness, and\ndynamism. It is continuous because it never stops in renewing itself.\nIt is holistic because it includes everything in the universe and\npermeates in all aspects of life. It is dynamic because it is full of\nmotion and movement, generating energy and strength all the time (Tu\n1985: 38–39). In this cosmic flow, there is no distinction\nbetween the following: the natural realm and the human realm, an\nobserving subject and an observed object, and the inner world and the\nouter world. Everything is part of a totality, a group dance that\nnever stops.\n\n\nTo the Yijing commentators, the unfolding of the universe is\nvividly portrayed in the 8 trigrams and 64 hexagrams. For instance,\nthey see the 8 trigrams (☰, ☱, ☲, ☳,\n☴, ☵, ☶, ☷) as graphic representations of\nthe mixing of the yin and yang cosmic forces (or\nqi, energy). With different combinations of a straight line\n(—) representing the yang cosmic force, and a broken\nline (‒ ‒) representing the yin cosmic force, a\ntrigram symbolizes the cosmos’ constant renewal and its creation\nof the myriad things. Similarly, a hexagram is also a symbol of the\nunfolding of the universe. For example, a hexagram can be divided into\ntwo trigrams: the lower trigram (lines 1–3) and the upper\ntrigram (lines 4–6). With two trigrams, a hexagram symbolizes\nthe interaction of two sets of yin-yang\nconfiguration, demonstrating the multiple ways in which the\nyin and yang forces interact and transform each\nother. Or, one takes the lower two lines of a hexagram as representing\nthe earth (di), the middle two lines as representing\nhumankind (ren), and the top two lines as representing heaven\n(tian). Then, we have a trigram within a hexagram. Known as\nthe “three potencies” (san cai), the relation of\nheaven, earth, and humankind highlights the co-dependence between the\nnatural realm (tian and di) and the human realm\n(ren).\n\n\n\n\n\nWith trigrams and hexagrams as symbols of the “three\npotencies”, the starting point of Yijing philosophy is\nthe acceptance of human finitude. On the one hand, the “three\npotencies” highlight the limits of human beings in shaping the\nnatural environment. On the other, they empower human beings to pursue\ntheir goals if they are willing to adapt to the natural environment.\nFor instance, in Xici (one of the “Ten Wings”),\nthe authors point out that in the oracles there were encouraging words\nsuch as “auspicious” (ji) and “without\nblame” (wujiu), and stern warnings against\n“calamity” (xiong), “blame”\n(jiu), “regret” (hui) and\n“remorse” (lin) (Xici I: 3, 7). These\ncontrasting prognostications highlight the harsh reality of human\nexistence. In some incidents, the wind of luck is on our side;\nwhatever we do seems to go well. But in other incidents, we are\nclearly out of luck: no matter how hard we try, we are doomed to\nfailure. \nTo elucidate what they mean by the harsh reality of human existence,\nthe Xici authors identify the period when hexagrams were used\nin divination. They write: \nThe Changes came into use in the period of middle antiquity.\nThose who composed the Changes had fear and anxiety.\n(Xici II: 7; WB: 345, with modifications) \nHere, the Xici authors link the popularity of hexagram\ndivination to the momentous transition when the mandate of heaven\n(tianming)—the power to rule China—was abruptly\npassed from the Shang family to the Zhou family. To highlight the\nimportance of divination in assuaging human fear, the Xici\nauthors coin two terms—fear (you) and anxiety\n(huan)—to describe the different states of human\napprehension of uncertainty. To further clarify what fear and anxiety\nmean, the Xici authors write: \nThe time at which the Change came to the fore was that in\nwhich the house of Yin [Shang] came to an end and the way of the house\nof Zhou 周 was rising, that is, the time when King Wen and the tyrant\nZhou 紂 were pitted against each other. This is why the hexagram\nstatements of the book so frequently warn against danger. He who is\nconscious of danger creates peace for himself, he who takes things\nlightly creates his own downfall. (Xici II:11; WB: 352, with\nmodifications) \nDirectly linking the popularity of hexagram divination to the epic\nbattle between the last ruler of Shang (King Zhou) and the first ruler\nof Zhou (King Wen), the Xici authors see hexagrams as stern\nwarnings against danger and downfall. In these warnings, hexagrams\nprovoked fear by reminding readers—typically, those involved in\ngovernment—of the disastrous consequences of bad decisions and\nreckless moves (such as the tyrant Zhou’s brutality that led to\nthe downfall of the Shang). They also instilled anxiety by calling\nattention to the vulnerability of human beings and the randomness in\nhuman fate (such as the sudden fall of the Shang and the unexpected\nrise of the Zhou). Whether provoking fear or instilling anxiety, the\neffect of hexagram divination is the same. It forces readers to\nreflect on their arrogance, complacency and self-indulgence. It shocks\nthem to look for ways to come to terms with contingency and\nserendipity. Above all, it directs attention to the dark side of human\nexistence such as disease, deformation, degeneration, and death\n(Redmond & Hon 2014: 128–139). \nFor the Xici’s authors, it did not matter whether\ndanger and downfall happened in the political realm or in one’s\nbody. The truth of the matter is that human beings have little control\nof their fate. At the same time, the Xici’s authors\nalso sought to console nervous readers, assuring them that if they\nlearnt to read hexagrams properly, they will discern the pattern\nbehind incessant changes. They write: \nThe Changes is a book from which one may not hold aloof. Its\ndao [i.e., pattern] is forever changing—alternating,\nmovement without rest, flowing through the six empty places [of a\nhexagram]; rising and sinking without fixed law, firm and yielding\ntransform each other. They cannot be confined within a rule; it is\nonly change that is at work here. They move inward and outward\naccording to fixed rhythms. Without and within, they teach caution.\nThey also show care and sorrow and their causes. Though you have no\nteacher, approach them as you would your parents. (“Xici”\nII: 7; WB: 348–49, with modifications) \nSeen in this light, the 64 hexagrams are no longer oracles. They\nbecome symbols of the constant movements in the universe and the\nceaseless changes in one’s life. More important, they point to\nthe intricate networks of factors or forces—from near to far\naway, from simple to complicated, from visible to invisible—that\nshape movements and changes. \nTake, for instance, Qian ䷀ (The Creative #1). The line\nstatements depict the six yang lines as a dragon in various\npositions—a “hidden dragon” in line one at the\nbottom, an “emerging dragon” in line two, a\n“wavering dragon” in line four, a “flying\ndragon” in line five, and an “arrogant dragon” in\nline six at the top (see\n Appendix 5).\n In addition, the line statements suggest a correspondence between the\ndragon’s position and a proper course of action: the\n“hidden dragon” should avoid taking aggressive action, the\n“emerging dragon” and the “flying dragon”\nshould seek help from “a great man”, the “wavering\ndragon” should take flight over the depths despite the danger\nand apparent risks, and the “arrogant dragon” will regret\nbeing stubborn and excessively confident. But, as a hexagram,\nQian is ambiguous. On the one hand, in five of its six lines,\nthe tone seems to be upbeat, projecting an impression of an incessant\nprogress from a hidden dragon to an emerging dragon, a wavering dragon\nand finally a flying dragon. On the other hand, the progression is\nabruptly cut short by the downfall of an arrogant dragon. Like a Greek\ntragedy, the rapid fall of the arrogant dragon suggests hubris,\nhighlighting the danger of excessive human pride in making strenuous\nefforts to pull oneself up.  \nIn Tuan (another piece of the “Ten Wings”), the\nauthors emphasize the importance of mounting of the six dragons of\nQian in a timely fashion (shi cheng liu long) (for a\ntranslation of the Tuan statement, see WB: 370–72). By\nmounting of the six dragons in a timely fashion, the Tuan\nauthors mean two things. First, they view the six lines of\nQian as constantly changing their positions. Even if one\nstrictly follows the incremental progress from a hidden dragon (the\nfirst line) to an emerging dragon (the second line) to a flying dragon\n(the fifth line), upon reaching the top (an arrogant dragon), one must\ngo back down to a hidden dragon and to start all over again. Second,\nthe Tuan authors suggest readers choose a dragon most\nsuitable to them, such as to assume the position of a hidden dragon\nwhen starting a new business or beginning a new career, to act like an\nemerging dragon after receiving recognition from peers or bosses, to\nbe like a wavering dragon when making crucial transition in career or\nlocation, to be like a flying dragon when everything seems to be\nflourishing, and last but not least, to avoid becoming an arrogant\ndragon when everything looks perfect but a decline is imminent.  \nIn short, the Tuan authors urge readers to view Qian\nmetaphorically as a spatial-temporal grid to reflect on their\nsurroundings, to look for alternatives, and to anticipate dangers and\npitfalls. As such, Qian becomes a symbol of the ever-changing\nuniverse. It is particularly helpful when we are at a critical\njuncture of our lives. At that moment—one may say, the\nYijing moment—we feel especially vulnerable and\nfragile, because we are reminded of the confluence of factors that\nshape our lives and the dangers of making a wrong decision. On the\nother hand, Qian also suggest that we act decisively to\n“mount the six dragons in a timely manner”. Once we mount\nthe six dragons, we become part of the great flow of the universe. We\nmay be a hidden dragon or an arrogant dragon when we enter the great\nflow, but as we are swept along by the current, we should find our\nposition, our rhythm, our trajectory. In the end, the key point is not\nwhen and how we enter the great flow of the universe, but what we\nbecome and what we achieve after we join the great flow. \nIn the “Ten Wings”, different authors offer different\nstrategies for individuals to find their roles in the great flow of\nthe universe. For instance, the Shuogua authors suggest that\na person should focus on the 8 trigrams as symbols of the unfolding of\nthe universe, such as Gen ☶ representing mountain,\nLi ☲ representing fire, Kan ☵\nrepresenting water, and Zheng ☳ representing thunder\n(for a summary of the main argument of Shuagua, see WB:\n356–65). Like the “Five Agents” (metal, wood, water,\nfire, and earth), the eight trigrams graphically denote the basic\nelements of the universe that produce the myriad things. The\nShuogua authors also propose that we think of the 8 trigrams\nas symbols of directions, strategically placed in the\neast-south-west-north grid. With the cosmic grand scheme in mind, the\nShuohua authors urge us to find solace in the rises and falls\nin human life. \nWhereas the Shuogua authors focus on the 8 trigrams, the\nXugua authors pay special attention to the sequence of the 64\nhexagrams (for a full translation of Xugua, see Lynn 1994:\n103–110). In rationalizing the hexagram sequences, the\nXugua authors match the order of hexagrams with key moments\nof human evolution, beginning with the construction of a primitive\ncommunity to the establishment of a patrilineal family structure based\non gender distinctions and matrimony. Later, the patrilineal family\nstructure is further expanded into a complex socio-political system\nbased on the distinctions between kings and officials, and rulers and\nruled. While this process of development seems inevitable,\noccasionally the Xugua authors call attention to challenges\nand obstacles in maintaining a stable community. They identify moments\nwhere the socio-political order is corrupt (Kui #38 and\nJian #39) or disintegrated (Huan #59). Because of\nthe danger of corruption and disintegration, the Xugua\nauthors emphasize the need for renewing the socio-political order by\nreplacing corrupt leaders (Ge #49) and re-structuring the\nentire system (Ding #50). Nevertheless, occasional\ninterruptions do not interfere with or slow down the steady progress\nof humankind. Based on this epic saga, the Xugua authors\nplace the fortune and misfortune of individuals in the longue\ndurée of human evolution. Accidents, irritant behaviors,\nunexpected occurrences, and unplanned actions are absorbed and\nrationalized in the onward march of humankind. \nIf one just reads the Shuogua and the Xugua,\ndivination does not seem to have a role in decision making. One makes\ndecisions based on either the confluence of cosmic forces or the\nlongue durée of human evolution. But in the\nXici, divination is important. In fact, an extended passage\nis devoted to discussing how to perform divination with 50 yarrow\nstalks (Xici I: 8, more about it later). In addition, the\nXici authors identify divination as one of four ways to use\nthe hexagrams: (1) to use the hexagram statements and line statements\nas warnings against danger and downfall; (2) to use the changes in\ntrigrams and hexagrams to understand the ceaseless changes in the\nnatural realm and the human realm; (3) to use hexagram images to\nenhance rulers’ authority; (4) to use divination to provoke\ninquirers to think more deeply about their choices (Xici I:\n9; WB: 314). Based on these four-fold uses of hexagrams, the\nXici authors highlight the broad appeal of the\nYijing. It can be a book of “wisdom”\n(zhi) for those who are interested in pondering the causes\nand patterns of change; it can be a book of “kindness”\n(ren) for those who are interested in improving the political\norder; it can be a book of “life” (riyong) for\nthose who just want to live, overcome obstacles, and make fewer\nmistakes (Xici I: 4; WB: 298). These three\napproaches—the cosmological, the political, and the\nexistential—formed the bases for Yijing commentators to\nphilosophize change. Over the two thousand years after the\ncanonization of the Yijing in 125 BCE, commentators developed\nthree distinct views toward change—the cosmology of change, the\nontology of change, and the moral-metaphysics of change. \nRulers of the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) were obsessed with\nbuilding an eternal empire, a humanly-made system that not only\nmimicked the recurrent pattern of the universe but also responded\nproactively to the ebb and flow of cosmic forces (Pines 2009, 2012).\nThis everlasting structure was stable and flexible, massive and\nspecific, synchronizing human activities for the unfolding of the\nuniverse. Its goal was to merge the natural and human realms, such\nthat the two became one and the same (Loewe 1994, 2005; Wang 2000).\n \nKnown as correlative cosmology, the purpose behind this fusion of the\nnatural and human realms was to focus attention on “the mutual\nresponsiveness of heaven and humanity” (Queen 1996: 1–53).\nThis mutual responsiveness of nature and humankind was based on two\nassumptions. First, the cosmos is orderly and stable. Its orderliness\nand stability are shown in the regular succession in time, such as the\nfour seasons, the twelve months, the 365¼ days. Second, the\nsame orderliness of the natural world is found in the human realm in\nthe forms of life cycles, the rhythm of work and rest, and the rise\nand fall of family fortunes. Despite the vicissitudes on the surface,\nthe natural and human worlds are balanced, systematic and predictable.\nThey are perfect mirrors of each other, such that when one moves, the\nother responds. \nThe goal of correlative cosmology was not to develop a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the universe. Rather, it was to legitimize the\ntransition “from the concept of imperial sovereignty based on\nmight into the need to support a claim to rule with intellectual\nsanctions” (Loewe 1994: 121–41). Thus, the emperor was\nsaid to be the crucial link between the natural and human realms. In\nfact, according to the Han scholar Dong Zhongshu (ca. 195–105\nBCE), the Chinese character for king (王) reflected the solemn\nresponsibility of the emperor (symbolized by the vertical stroke in\nthe middle) for connecting the three potencies ☰: heaven\n(tian), earth (di) and humankind (ren)\n(Redmond & Hon 2014: 159–61). As such, the emperor was\nindeed the Son of Heaven (tianzi) who was omnicompetent,\nomnipotent and omniscient (Loewe 2011; Queen 1996). \nTo support absolutism, Han commentators transformed the\nYijing into a cosmological manual reflecting the ebb and flow\nof cosmic forces. They earnestly reorganized the hexagram sequence to\nmatch the cosmic rhythm, demonstrating that the natural and human\nrealms are one and the same. Although most of the writings of the Han\ncommentators are lost, in an 8th-9th century\ntext, Zhouyi jijie (A Collection of Explanations on the\nChanges of Zhou Dynasty) edited by Li Dingzuo, we have\nglimpses of the ambition of the Han commentators who spent their lives\nfathoming the cosmos and ordering the world (R. Smith 2008:\n57–88). \nFor instance, Jing Fang (77–37 BCE) created the Hexagrams of\nEight Palaces (ba gong gua): Qian ䷀,\nKun ䷁, Zhen ䷲, Xun ䷸,\nKan ䷜, Li ䷝, Gen ䷳,\nDui ䷹. These eight palace hexagrams are the doubles of\nthe eight trigrams. For Jing, each of these palace hexagrams leads a\ngroup of seven hexagrams. For example, Qian ䷀ leads\n䷫, ䷠, ䷋, ䷓, ䷖, ䷢, ䷍.\nIn this new alignment of hexagrams, there is both a steady increase or\ndecrease of the yin and yang cosmic forces, and the\nthe hidden power of the two forces even when they are dormant (for the\nnew sequence of 64 hexagrams based on eight palaces, see Nielson 2003:\n3). \nAnother new sequence of hexagrams was the “waning and waxing\nhexagrams” (xiaoxi gua) perfected by Yu Fan\n(164–233). Representing the ebb and flow of the yin and\nyang cosmic forces, the “waning and waxing\nhexagrams” go as follows: \nFu ䷗[24]→\nLin ䷒[19] →\nTai ䷊[11] →\nDazhuang ䷡[34] →\nGuai  ䷪[43] → Qian \n䷀[1] →\nGou ䷫[44] →\nDun ䷠[33] →\nPi ䷋[12] →\nGuan ䷓[20] →\nBo ䷖[23] →\nKun ䷁[2] (back to Fu) \nWhen reading from Fu to Qian, the yang\nforce gradually increases while the yin force decreases. When\nreading from Gou to Kun, the yin force\nincreases while the yang force decreases. As a system, the\ntwelve hexagrams are continuous. When the series ends with\nKun, it begins anew with Fu (Nielson 2003:\n275–76). \nBy developing these new hexagram sequences, the Han Yijing\ncommentators wanted to achieve two goals. First, they freed themselves\nfrom the original sequence of the 64 hexagrams that was, to them,\nincoherent and inconsistent. To the Han commentators, the problem of\nthe original sequence was its failure in lining up hexagrams in\naccordance with their graphic images. By creating new sequences, the\nHan scholars were able to match perfectly the hexagram images with the\nebb and flow of cosmic forces (Redmond & Hon 2014: 159–163).\nSecond, with the new sequences, the Han commentators were better\nequipped to synchronize the hexagrams with the lunar calendar, showing\na direct correspondence between the ebb and flow of the cosmic forces\nand the cycles of life in human society (R. Smith 2008: 62–77).\nFor instance, the “waning and waxing hexagrams” were\nassigned to represent months in the lunar calendar: Fu\n䷗ (the eleventh month), Lin ䷒ (the twelfth\nmonth), Tai ䷊ (the first month of the following year),\nDazhuang ䷡ (the second month), Guai ䷪\n(the third month), Qian ䷀ (the fourth month),\nGou ䷫ (the fifth month), Dun ䷠ (the\nsixth month), Pi ䷋ (the seventh month), Guan\n䷓ (the eighth month), Bo ䷖ (the ninth month),\nand Kun ䷁ (the tenth month) (Nielson 2003:\n275–76). The same could be done for the hexagrams sequence based\non the eight palaces. By matching the new sequence of the 64 hexagrams\nwith 12 months, the Han commentators allotted eight months to four\nhexagrams and four months to eight hexagrams (Nielson 2003: 5). \nTo Han commentators, while the new hexagram sequences highlighted\ncertainty in the universe’s self-renewal, each hexagram\nrepresented the possibility of coping with the changing environment.\nThese differing functions addressed a fundamental question in ruling a\nhuge empire: How to formulate flexible policies while keeping a\nsemblance of unity and uniformity? To give themselves flexibility in\ninterpreting hexagrams, the Han commentators created new interpretive\nstrategies. One common strategy called for linking one hexagram to\nfour hexagrams. Take, for instance, Qian ䷀ (The\nCreative, #1). To interpret the hexagram, one can link it to its\nopposite, Kun ䷁ (The Receptive, #2), known as\n“laterally linked hexagrams” (pangtong) (Nielson\n2003: 185–88). In addition, Qian can also be read along\nwith its preceding hexagram and following hexagram in accordance with\nthe sequence of the “waning and waxing hexagrams”. So,\nQian can be read in relation to Guai ䷪\n(Resolution, #43), its antecedent, and Gou ䷫\n(Encounter, #44), its posterior. And then, within a hexagram, one can\nalso create “interlocking trigrams” (hugua or\nhuti), that is, using four or five of the hexagram lines to\nform two new trigrams (Nielson 2003: 111–14). In the case of\nQian, it is not possible to create “interlocking\ntrigrams” due to all six lines being yang. But in other\ncases, the “interlocking trigrams” are significant in\ndeciphering the meaning of a hexagram. Take, for instance, Ge\n䷰ (Radical Change, #49). Its second, third, and fourth lines\nform a Sun trigram ☴ and its third, four, and fifth\nform a Qian trigram ☰ Combining Sun and\nQian forms Gou ䷫ (Encounter, #44) \nAnother strategy of expanding the scope of interpretation was to turn\na hexagram into a different one by transposing some of its lines.\nKnown as “changing the positions of hexagram lines”\n(yiwei), this strategy allowed Han scholars to introduce\nother hexagrams when having problems interpreting a hexagram. For\ninstance, Tai ䷊ (Peace, #11) can become Jiji\n䷾ (Ferrying Complete #63) by transposing its second line (a\nyang) and its fifth line (a yin). Likewise,\nDazhuang ䷡ (Great Strength, #34) can turn into\nXu ䷄ (Waiting, #5) by switching its fourth line (a\nyang) and its fifth line (a yin). Much more\nversatile than other methods, the transposition of hexagram lines gave\nHan commentators the liberty to inject a broad range of alternatives\nwhen interpreting a hexagram. \nThus, by giving themselves flexibility in interpreting hexagrams, the\nHan commentators reaffirmed the orderliness, stability and\npredictability of the cosmic and human realms. They transformed the\nYijing into a cosmological manual to match the rhythm of\ncosmic forces. In doing so, the Han commentators suppressed and\nexternalized the human fear of uncertainty. They suppressed fear by\nfocusing attention on the repeated rhythm of the universe, as\nevidenced by the seasonal changes and the passage of time from month\nto month. They externalized fear by concentrating on the grand scheme\nof the universe’s renewal that did not seem to give room to\nuncertainty or rupture. More important, by matching the cosmic realm\nwith the human rhythm, they created an illusion that the\nYijing was a ruler’s playbook to fathom the cosmos and\norder the world (Ch’en 1986: 798–801; R. Smith 2008:\n62–88). \nBut the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 CE reveals a fundamental\nproblem of correlative cosmology, namely, human beings are incapable\nof fully discerning the cosmic pattern, nor can they completely apply\nthe cosmic pattern to human affairs. Even if they tried to mimic the\ncosmic rhythm in governing the human world, the human world is far too\ncomplicated for anyone to handle. In the following seven hundred\nyears, Yijing scholars retreated from fathoming the cosmos.\nInstead, they turned their attention to ordering the human world and\nlooked for its deep structure. \nThe major figure who started this turn to the human world was Wang Bi\n(226–249). Born six years after the collapse of the Han dynasty,\nWang Bi was thrown into a situation in which there seemed to be few\ncertainties in life. With China divided into three separate\nkingdoms—the Wei, the Shu, and the Wu—there was widespread\ndisorder in the country. When everything was in ruin, fewer and fewer\npeople followed the Confucian precepts of honesty, loyalty and filial\npiety. Instead, trickery, usurpation and pragmatic calculation became\nthe accepted strategies for survival. Apparently, Wang Bi’s\nexperience after the collapse of the Han dynasty brought him face to\nface with fear and anxiety—the two recurrent themes in the\nYijing (Hon 2010).  Before his premature death at\nthe age of 23, Wang wrote a commentary on the Yijing along\nwith a commentary on the Laozi. Attached to his\nYijing commentary, the Zhouyi zhu (A Commentary\non the Changes of Zhou Dynasty), were\nseven essays in which he discussed how to read the classic. In these\nessays (rendered as “General Remarks on the Changes of the\nZhou” by Richard John Lynn, see Lynn 1994: 25–39), he\nrevisited themes that had been discussed in the Xici,\nincluding what a hexagram symbolizes and what the six lines of a\nhexagram tell us about human existence. In these essays, he presented\na notion of change that was completely new. \nFirst and foremost, unlike the Han commentators, Wang Bi did not\nconsider the hexagram sequence as important. Instead, he regards each\nof the 64 hexagrams as a discrete situation. Furthermore, he points\nout that the uniqueness of each hexagram is succinctly summarized in\nTuan (one of the “Ten Wings”), such as\nZhun ䷂ (Difficulty at the Beginning #3) discusses the\ndifficulty when someone starts an endeavor, Meng ䷃\n(Youthful Folly, #4) focuses on how a teacher hone his or her skills\nin teaching; Xu ䷄ (Waiting #5) suggests a pause to\nreflect on one’s precarious situation (“Ming Tuan”,\nLynn 1994: 25–27). As such, readers do not have to strictly\nfollow the hexagram sequence in reading hexagrams. They can pick and\nchoose hexagrams that appear to directly address questions in mind. No\nmatter which hexagrams they pick, the key point is to see a hexagram\nas a field of action where different forces or players interact. \nThus, for Wang Bi, the purpose of reading hexagrams is to reflect on\none’s situation (“Mingyao tongbian”, Lynn 1994:\n27–29). The six lines of a hexagram—even a bad one like\nGu ䷑ (Ills to Be Cured, #18)—offer options to\nrespond to a situation. They represent the room to maneuver within a\nsystem or the possibilities of altering an existing power structure.\nPrecisely in this juncture that exists between what is already\nconfigurated and what can be changed, Wang Bi sees the fluidity of\nhuman affairs. With proper action, one can turn what appears to be a\nfailure into a blessing. Conversely, lacking appropriate action, one\ncan make what appears to be flourishing into a disaster. \nFor this reason, Wang Bi does not find the inauspicious hexagram\nSun ䷨ (Diminution, #41) terribly frightening (Lynn\n1994: 387–96). Judging from its hexagram image and line\nstatements, Sun suggests a situation where those who are high\nup take advantage of those who are in lower positions, or those who\nare physically strong victimize those who are weak. Yet, despite the\ninjustice denoted in the hexagram, Wang Bi believes there is still\nroom for optimism. “Supreme good fortune” will come, he\ndeclares, if someone finds ways to benefit the public. Similarly, the\n“oppressions” in hexagram Kun ䷮ (Impasse,\n#47) are avoidable (Lynn 1994: 428–37). Judging from its line\nstatements, Kun is hopeless. All of its six lines are plagued\nwith some form of oppression: the first line is buried under a barren\ntree, the second line is burdened with excessive drinking and eating,\nthe third line is caught in rocks, the fourth line is locked in a\ngolden carriage, the fifth line is bullied by a man with purple knee\nbands, and the sixth line is wrapped by creeping vines. Yet Wang Bi\nargues that by making the right decision one can reverse what seems to\nbe an oppressive situation into an opportunity for growth and\nadvancement. \nBy stressing human agency and activism, Wang Bi sees hexagrams as\npointers, directing our attention to the source of human creativity\nand ingenuity. As pointers, hexagrams and hexagram lines serve\ndifferent functions. While a hexagram connotes a field of action, the\nsix hexagram lines stand for the six players (or the six options) in\nthat field of action (“Minggua shibian tongyao”, Lynn\n1994: 29–31). Symbolizing the whole, a hexagram represents a web\nof relations governing the actions and interactions of the six\nplayers. Symbolizing the parts, hexagram lines represent what the six\nplayers can or cannot do to advance their interests. Hence, in reading\nhexagrams, Yijing readers are constantly reminded that every\naspect of human life, big or small, is governed by the part-whole\nrelationship. To cope with change, Wang Bi asserts, we must find out\nthe part-whole relationship in each given situation—be it in\nfamily, society, or a solitary quest for spiritual communion with\nnature. \nIn his comments on the Xici I:9 (preserved by Han Kangbo\n[332–380]), Wang Bi explains this intricate relationship between\npart and whole. Originally a passage about divination, Xici\nI:9 begins with a discussion of selecting a hexagram by counting 50\nyarrow stalks. Known as “the number of Great Expansion”\n(dayan zhishu), the selection includes a step wherein the\ndiviner separates the 50 yarrow stalks into two piles: (a) a group of\n49 stalks that will be used to select a hexagram, and (b) an unused\nstalk that will be set aside in the rest of the divination procedure\n(for a translation of this passage, see WB: 310–315). Wang Bi\nviews the group of 49 stalks as you (Being) and the unused\nstalk as wu (Non-Being). He said, \nAfter expanding the numbers of Heaven and Earth, we find that the ones\nthat are of benefit to us number fifty, and of these we actually use\nforty-nine, thus leaving one unused. Although this one is not used,\nyet through it the use of the other numbers becomes readily possible,\nand, although this one is not one of the numbers, yet through it the\nother numbers are formed. As this one represents the supreme ultimate\nof change, the other forty-nine constitute the ultimate of numbers.\nNon-being [wu] cannot be brought to light by means of\nnon-being [wu] but must take place through being\n[you]. Therefore, by applying ourselves constantly to this\nultimate among things that have being [you], we shall surely\nbring to light the primogenitor from which all things derive. (Lynn\n1994: 60–61, with modifications) \nIn the studies of Neo-Daoism of the Wei-Jin period (220–589),\nscholars usually consider you (Being) and wu\n(Non-being) as a dichotomy, either as a contrast between the totality\nof the universe (Dao) and the myriad things, or as a\ndifferentiation between the principle governing the generation and\nregeneration of the universe (li) and the manifestations of\nthat principle in the activities of animate beings (Chan 1963 [1969:\n314–324]; Graham 1959; Schipper 1982 [1993: 192–208]).\nThis dichotomy may be accurate in discussing Neo-Daoism in general and\nWang Bi’s commentary to the Laozi in particular. But in\nWang Bi’s Yijing commentary, he sees you\n(Being) and wu (Non-being) as co-dependent (Tang 2015:\n51–59; Wagner 2003: 83–147; Yu 2007: 116–148,\n204–240). He argues that the one unused stalk symbolizes\nwu (Non-being), and the forty-nine used stalks stand for\nyou (Being). On the one hand, you depends on\nwu because the forty-nine yarrow stalks become useful only\nwhen they are utilized in casting a hexagram. On the other hand,\nwu cannot fulfill itself without you because there\nis no way to perform a divination without the 49 yarrow stalks. As\nwu, the practice of divination gives unity and coherence to\nthe act of throwing of the 49 yarrow stalks. As you, the act\nof throwing the 49 yarrow stalks makes divination possible. \nOne may argue that Wang Bi’s reading of hexagrams limits the\nYijing to concrete human affairs. Unlike the Han\ncommentators, Wang Bi had little interest in cosmology and rejected\nany attempt to match the cosmic realm with the human realm. But in\nseeing hexagrams as pointers revealing the co-dependence of part and\nwhole, substance and function, Wang Bi reminds us that the\nYijing is meant to be read metaphorically. In focusing on\nhexagrams as pointers—pointing toward something hidden, implicit\nand yet fundamental—he avoids the mistake of the Han\ncommentators who turn the Yijing into a copious system of\nsigns to document the multifarious changes in the universe. To him,\nthe Han scholars’ attempt is futile because they do not accept\nthe basic tenet of the Yijing—the limits of human\nknowledge (“Ming Xiang”, Lynn 1994: 31–32). \nWang Bi’s Yijing commentary became the standard for\ninterpreting the classic throughout mid-imperial China. Its august\nstatus was confirmed by the state-approved Zhouyi zhengyi\n(The True Meanings of Changes of the Zhou\nDynasty) edited by Kong Yingda (574–648). Throughout the\nTang dynasty (618–907) and the Song dynasty (960–1126),\nknowledge of Wang Bi’s Yijing commentary was tested in\ncivil service examinations. Its longevity as the standard\nYijing commentary indicated consensus among the Chinese elite\nthat attention must be paid to solving the pressing problems in the\ncountry rather than building an eternal empire that mimicked the\ncosmic rhythm (Hon 2004, 2005; R. Smith 2008: 89–139). \nHowever, while Wang Bi criticized the Han commentators for being\noverly ambitious in blending the natural and human realms, he was also\noverly ambitious in using human reason to discern the hidden principle\nof human affairs. Whereas Han commentators suppressed and externalized\nthe human fear of uncertainty, Wang also suppressed and externalized\nthe same fear. In viewing hexagrams as fields of action, he suppressed\nthe fear by absorbing it into part-whole relations in human affairs.\nBy turning hexagrams into pointers, he externalized the fear by\nconnecting it to a search for the principle of change in the rises and\nfalls of human life. In the end, both the Han scholars and Wang Bi\nwere hubristic in assuming they were omniscient. \nIn contrast, Zhu Xi (1130–1200)—a key figure of the\nCheng-Zhu School of Neo-Confucianism of late imperial\nChina—argued that the “original meaning”\n(benyi) of Yijing was divination. On the surface of\nit, Zhu Xi’s argument seemed redundant. It had been well-known\nthat the first two layers of the classics were oracles originating\nfrom the Western Zhou period. But Zhu Xi’s point was that for\nmore than a thousand years since the canonization of the\nYijing, the classic had never been read properly as a\ndivination manual. For this reason, Zhu Xi believed that the true\nmeaning of Yijing lay in the imagery of the 64 hexagrams. To\ndistinguish the 64 hexagrams from the “Ten Wings”, Zhu Xi\ncreated two separate categories in his commentary, the Zhouyi\nbenyi (The Original Meaning of the Changes\nof the Zhou Dynasty). One category was\nthe “classic” (jing) which covered the 64\nhexagrams; the other the “commentarial materials”\n(zhuan) which included the “Ten Wings”. With\nthese two categories, Zhu made clear that the “Ten Wings”\nwere at best supplementary materials in understanding the\nhexagrams. \nUnderlying his view was a different understanding of the formation of\nthe Yijing. Unlike other Yijing commentators, Zhu\ndid not see the classic as an evolution from divination to philosophy.\nFor him, the sixty-four hexagrams are the foundation of the\nYijing because they are symbols of the constant changes in\nthe natural and human worlds. This pictorial depiction of\ntransformation—started by Fu Xi and completed by King Wen and\nthe Duke of Zhou—was later turned into a discussion of cosmology\nand morality by Confucian scholars. As a result, the Yijing\nceased to be a pictorial description of the awesome and awe-inspiring\ntransformation in the universe; it became merely another text (like\nthe Book of Poetry and the Book of History in the\nConfucian canon) that taught morality to kings, nobles and government\nofficials (Hon 2008). \nBy privileging Fu Xi’s hexagrams over Confucius’s\n“Ten Wings”, Zhu Xi wanted to achieve two goals. First, he\nunderscored the importance of divination as a method of\nself-cultivation. For him, divination is not a superstitious act of\nseeking guidance from a supernatural power. Rather, it is an enriching\nexperience of encountering the unknown and unfathomable. In the\nprocess of divination, one faces the multiple forces that shape human\nlife, and thereby becomes aware of the opportunities and resources for\nimproving one’s situation. As Joseph Adler observes, divination\nis “a way of learning” to Zhu Xi because it helps learners\n“‘respond’ (ying) to\n‘incipient’ change (chi), both in external events\nand in the mind” (Adler 1990: 190). Second, by focusing on the\nvisual imagery of the hexagrams, Zhu Xi saw the Yijing as\nsignificantly different from other Confucian classics. Rather than\nlimiting to kings, nobles and government officials, the\nYijing appeals to a broad audience who, literate or\nilliterate, are concerned with uncertainties in life (Hon 2011). \nFor this reason, Zhu Xi emphasized the ambiguity of line statements.\nTo highlight their ambiguity, he divided the line statements into two\nseparate utterances: a summary of the image of the hexagram line\n(xiang), and a prognostication based on a careful\nconsideration of the image of the hexagram line (zhan). By\ndividing a line statement into two parts, Zhu Xi turns a line\nstatement into a dialogue between the oracle’s calling to\nattention and the reader’s response. In this hermeneutical\ncircle, nothing is certain or preordained. The conversation can lead\nin many directions, sometimes predictable and sometimes\nunpredictable. \nOn the surface of it, like Wang Bi, Zhu Xi appears to use the\nYijing to provoke readers to reflect on their surroundings.\nHowever, there is one fundamental difference. For Zhu Xi, a reading of\nthe Yijing does not necessarily answer all questions or solve\nall problems. Rather, it heightens the reader’s sensitivity to\nthe uncertainty and serendipity of human existence. For instance,\nGe ䷰ (Radical Change, #49) and Ding ䷱\n(The Cauldron, #50) are known for highlighting the anxiety and fear in\na drastic political change. In Ge, the reader is encouraged\nto lead a revolt against a tyrant ruler who is causing harm to the\npublic. To underscore the urgency of addressing the political crisis,\nthe revolt is compared to the renewal of lives in seasonal changes; it\nis paired with the pivotal event of the Shang dynasty being replaced\nby the Zhou dynasty. Above all, it is described as a timely\nintervention in human affairs to restore order for the benefit of the\nmasses (for a translation of Ge, see WB: 189–192).\nWhile Ge advocates a regime change, Ding demands the\nrestoration of political order immediately following the revolt.\nGraphically, the six lines of Ding ䷱ resemble a\ncauldron—the bottom line represents the legs of the cauldron;\nthe second to fourth lines symbolize the belly of the cauldron; the\nfifth line denotes the ears of the cauldron, and the top line suggests\nthe bar that carries the cauldron from place to place. Thus, the\nreader is encouraged to clean the cauldron to make food, or, in the\naftermath of a regime change, to immediately re-establish the\npolitical order (for a translation of Ding, see WB:\n195–97). \nFor centuries, the Yijing’s commentators heeded the\nXugua authors’ advice to read Ge and\nDing together as two phases of a regime change (see WB: 635,\n641). While Ge discusses the destructive phase of toppling an\nold regime, Ding refers to the constructive phase of\nrebuilding the political order. The two hexagrams jointly call\nattention to the danger of political corruption, the fear of a tyrant,\nand the anxiety of losing control amid political upheaval. More\nimportant, the two hexagrams highlight the importance of making the\nright decision amidst power struggles. For this reason, through the\ncenturies, Ge and Ding received special attention\nfrom commentators who were interested in political philosophy (see,\nfor instance, Wang Bi’s commentary in Lynn 1994:\n444–59). \nFor Zhu Xi, however, there was no need to connect Ge with\nDing. Instead, he sees them as separate situations where\nreaders can ask different questions and express different concerns.\nFor him, the anxiety and fear in the Yijing appear not in the\nhexagram sequence, but in the dialogue between the oracle and the\nreader. To downplay the political connotations of these two hexagrams,\nZhu Xi stresses the intensity of the oracle-reader dialogue. Take, for\nexample, the hexagram statement of Ge which seems to suggest\nthe possibility of “the disappearance of remorse”\n(huiwang) after political change. For Zhu, there is no way to\ntell whether “the disappearance of remorse” is possible\nwithout considering the reader’s situation. If the reader is\ndoing the right things, then remorse will automatically disappear. But\nif the reader is making a mistake, remorse will remain. Hence,\n“the disappearance of remorse” is provisional; whether the\noracle will come true rests in reader’s motive, sincerity and\naction. Similarly, “the disappearance of remorse” in the\nfourth line of Ge is provisional as well. Traditionally, the\nfourth line is read as a leader ready to lead a political change. For\nZhu Xi, the fourth line does not look like a situation ripe for\npolitical change. Rather, he sees “the disappearance of\nremorse” as a warning against rushing to make drastic changes\n(Hon 2008). \nLikewise, Zhu Xi does not see in Ding a roadmap to form a new\nregime. Instead, he sees each line of Ding as a separate\nsituation challenging the Yijing reader. For instance, in the\nfirst yin line, Zhu Xi is not worried about the line’s\nperipheral position. Rather, he is interested in the prognostication\n(zhen) which indicates that the line is “without\nremorse” (wujiu). In his comments, Zhu Xi focuses on\nthe subtle meaning of “without remorse” and urges the\nreader to be positive about the future. He tells the reader that\n“without remorse” is a result of the first line’s\ndetermination to come back from behind and its will to succeed despite\nits humble position (Hon 2008). \nUltimately, for Zhu Xi, all the Yijing oracles are\nprovisional. Their goal is to provoke thought, command attention, and\nabove all, make readers aware of the contingency of human existence.\nBy highlighting fear and anxiety in reading hexagrams, Zhu Xi\nincorporated the Yijing into his Neo-Confucian\nproject—an endeavor, he hoped, that would lead to the triumph of\nthe pure and perceptive “mind of the Dao”\n(daoxin) over the perturbed and perverse “human\nmind” (renxin). To develop a Confucian\nmoral-metaphysics, Zhu Xi turned to the split second of decision\nmaking as a battle ground of one’s moral cultivation. In that\nsplit second, Zhu Xi claimed, the human mind is deeply torn between\n“the mind of the Dao” and “the human\nmind”, and between “the heavenly principle”\n(tianli) and “human desires” (renyu)\n(Adler 2014; Tu 1985: 131–48). In this mental battle, the\nYijing reader is put into a moral-metaphysical journey. The\nhexagrams give the readers hope without losing sight of the immense\nchallenge of overcoming mishaps and failure. They promise success if\nreaders find the means to tame their searching minds and to counter\nthe distractions in their lives. Above all, they give spiritual depth\nto the readers’ moral struggle, turning it into a battle ground\nbetween following the dictates of the flesh, or elevating oneself to\nform a “trinity with heaven and earth”. \nIn this way, Zhu Xi opened the Yijing to a wide range of\naudience. By focusing on divination and the symbolism of the 64\nhexagrams, Zhu Xi made the Yijing relevant to readers who\nmight not be well educated. While it remained a canonical text, it was\ntransformed into “a book of life” for common people who\nstruggled daily to make the right decision between the purity of\n“the heavenly principle” and the perversion of\n“human desires” (Hon 2012). From the Ming dynasty\n(1368–1644) to the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), Zhu\nXi’s interpretation of the Yijing was promoted by the\nimperial government. It was included in the state-approved\nYijing commentaries, the Zhouyi daquan (The\nCompendium of Cheng Yi’s and Zhu Xi’s Commentaries on the\nChanges of the Zhou Dynasty) of the Ming\ndynasty, and the Zhouyi zhezhong (Balanced Annotations of\nthe Changes of the Zhou Dynasty) of the\nQing dynasty. \nOn the surface, these three approaches—the cosmology of change,\nthe ontology of change and the moral-metaphysics of\nchange—appear to steadily narrow the scope of philosophizing\nchange. They seem to continuously move away from the cosmos to the\nhuman world, and from the human world to an individual’s moral\ncogitations. One may even say that in this narrowing of the scope, we\nsee a retreat from the empirical to the intellectual, and from the\nobjective to the subjective. \nYet, in their own ways, these three approaches offer answers to the\nhuman fear of uncertainty that was characteristic of divination in\nearly China. Whether performed with yarrow stalks, coins or by\ncracking the bones of oxen, divination in early China was an attempt\nto calm the nerve and soothe the mind, giving inquirers the courage to\nmake decisions at the crossroads of their lives (Allan 1991; Gotshalk\n1999; Marshall 2001; Raphals 2013, Redmond 2017; Shaughnessy 1992\n[1997]; K. Smith 1989). On the other hand, the three approaches give\nhope to readers by transforming the hexagrams into symbols to discuss\nthe human role in the unfolding of the universe (Cheng 2003; Cheng\n& Ng 2009; Redmond & Hon 2014: 140–57; R. Smith 2008:\n31–48). Together, they make three arguments: \nThese three arguments are succinctly summarized into the “three\nmeanings of change” (yi you san yi) in Qian\nZuodu (Opening up the Regularities of Hexagram Qian) of\nthe Eastern Han (25–220): (1) the multifariousness in change\n(bianyi), (2) the constancy in change (buyi), and\n(3) at ease with change (yijian) (Nielson 2003:\n301–302, 304–305; R. Smith 2008: 78–79). \nIf we use these three meanings of change to compare the three\napproaches, the first two focus primarily on finding the constancy in\nchange (buyi) and thereby assuring us that everything is\npredictable. By contrast, the third pays special attention to\nincessant change (bianyi) and urges us to live with\nuncertainty and serendipity (yijian). If indeed\nfear—especially the fear of the uncertain future—is the\nfundamental tenet of the Yijing, the third approach is most\nhonest. Rather than suppressing or externalizing the fear of\nuncertainty, the third approach faces the fear squarely with humility\nand candidness. More important, it brings the struggle with the fear\nof uncertainty to everyday life, particularly in the split second when\nwe make decisions.
