Central\nquestions are: How can a group of individuals choose a winning outcome\n(e.g., policy, electoral candidate) from a given set of options? What\nare the properties of different voting systems? When is a voting system\ndemocratic? How can a collective (e.g., electorate, legislature,\ncollegial court, expert panel, or committee) arrive at coherent\ncollective preferences or judgments on some issues, on the basis of its\nmembers' individual preferences or judgments? How can we rank\ndifferent social alternatives in an order of social welfare? Social choice\ntheorists study these questions not just by looking at examples, but \nby developing general models and proving theorems.\n\n\n\nPioneered in the 18th century by Nicolas de Condorcet and\nJean-Charles de Borda and in the 19th century by Charles Dodgson (also\nknown as Lewis Carroll), social choice theory took off in the 20th\ncentury with the works of Kenneth Arrow, Amartya Sen, and Duncan Black.\nIts influence extends across economics, political science, philosophy,\nmathematics, and recently computer science and biology. Apart from\ncontributing to our understanding of collective decision procedures,\nsocial choice theory has applications in the areas of institutional\ndesign, welfare economics, and social epistemology.\n\n\n\nThe two scholars most often associated with the development of\nsocial choice theory are the Frenchman Nicolas de Condorcet (1743–1794)\nand the American Kenneth Arrow (born 1921). Condorcet was a liberal\nthinker in the era of the French Revolution who was pursued by the\nrevolutionary authorities for criticizing them. After a period of\nhiding, he was eventually arrested, though apparently not immediately\nidentified, and he died in prison (for more details on Condorcet, see\nMcLean and Hewitt 1994). In his Essay on the Application of\nAnalysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions (1785), he\nadvocated a particular voting system, pairwise majority voting, and\npresented his two most prominent insights. The first, known as\nCondorcet's jury theorem, is that if each member of a\njury has an equal and independent chance better than random, but worse\nthan perfect, of making a correct judgment on whether a defendant is\nguilty (or on some other factual proposition), the majority of jurors\nis more likely to be correct than each individual juror, and the\nprobability of a correct majority judgment approaches 1 as the jury\nsize increases. Thus, under certain conditions, majority rule is good\nat ‘tracking the truth’ (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld\n1983; List and Goodin 2001). \n\nCondorcet's second insight, often called Condorcet's\nparadox, is the observation that majority preferences can be\n‘irrational’ (specifically, intransitive) even when\nindividual preferences are ‘rational’ (specifically,\ntransitive). Suppose, for example, that one third of a group prefers\nalternative x to y to z, a second third\nprefers y to z to x, and a final third\nprefers z to x to y. Then there are\nmajorities (of two thirds) for x against y, for\ny against z, and for z against x: a\n‘cycle’, which violates transitivity. Furthermore, no\nalternative is a Condorcet winner, an alternative that beats,\nor at least ties with, every other alternative in pairwise majority\ncontests. \n\nCondorcet anticipated a key theme of modern social choice theory:\nmajority rule is at once a plausible method of collective decision\nmaking and yet subject to some surprising problems. Resolving or\nbypassing these problems remains one of social choice theory's\ncore concerns. \n\nWhile Condorcet had investigated a particular voting method\n(majority voting), Arrow, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics\nin 1972, introduced a general approach to the study of preference\naggregation, partly inspired by his teacher of logic, Alfred Tarski\n(1901–1983), from whom he had learnt relation theory as an undergraduate\nat the City College of New York (Suppes 2005). Arrow considered a class\nof possible aggregation methods, which he called social\nwelfare functions, and asked which of them satisfy certain axioms\nor desiderata. He proved that, surprisingly, there exists no method for\naggregating the preferences of two or more individuals over three or\nmore alternatives into collective preferences, where this method\nsatisfies five seemingly plausible axioms, discussed below. \n\nThis result, known as Arrow's impossibility theorem,\nprompted much work and many debates in social choice theory and welfare\neconomics. William Riker (1920–1993), who inspired the Rochester school\nin political science, interpreted it as a mathematical proof of the\nimpossibility of populist democracy (e.g., Riker 1982). Others, most\nprominently Amartya Sen (born 1933), who won the 1998 Nobel Memorial\nPrize, took it to show that ordinal preferences are insufficient for\nmaking satisfactory social choices. Commentators also questioned\nwhether Arrow's desiderata on an aggregation method are as\ninnocuous as claimed or whether they should be relaxed. \n\nThe lessons from Arrow's theorem depend, in part, on how we interpret\nan Arrovian social welfare function. The use of ordinal preferences as\nthe ‘aggregenda’ may be easier to justify if we interpret\nthe aggregation rule as a voting method than if we interpret\nit as a welfare evaluation method. Sen argued that when a\nsocial planner seeks to rank different social alternatives in an order\nof social welfare (thereby employing some aggregation rule as a\nwelfare evaluation method), it may be justifiable to use additional\ninformation over and above ordinal preferences, such as\ninterpersonally comparable welfare measurements (e.g., Sen 1982). \n\nArrow himself held the view  \nthat interpersonal comparison of\nutilities has no meaning and … that there is no meaning relevant\nto welfare comparisons in the measurability of individual\nutility. (1951/1963: 9) \n This view was influenced by\nneoclassical economics, associated with scholars such as Vilfredo\nPareto (1848–1923), Lionel Robbins (1898–1984), John Hicks (1904–1989),\nco-winner of the Economics Nobel Prize with Arrow, and Paul Samuelson\n(1915–2009), another Nobel Laureate. Arrow's theorem demonstrates\nthe stark implications of the ‘ordinalist’ assumptions of\nneoclassical thought. \n\nNowadays most social choice theorists have moved beyond the early\nnegative interpretations of Arrow's theorem and are interested in\nthe trade-offs involved in finding satisfactory decision procedures.\nSen has promoted this ‘possibilist’ interpretation of\nsocial choice theory (e.g., in his 1998 Nobel lecture). \n\nWithin this approach, Arrow's axiomatic method is perhaps even\nmore influential than his impossibility theorem (on the axiomatic\nmethod, see Thomson 2000). The paradigmatic kind of result in\ncontemporary axiomatic work is the ‘characterization\ntheorem’. Here the aim is to identify a set of plausible\nnecessary and sufficient conditions that uniquely characterize a\nparticular solution (or class of solutions) to a given type of\ncollective decision problem. An early example is Kenneth May's\n(1952) characterization of majority rule, discussed below. \n\nCondorcet and Arrow are not the only founding figures of social\nchoice theory. Condorcet's contemporary and co-national\nJean-Charles de Borda (1733–1799) defended a voting system that is\noften seen as a prominent alternative to majority voting. The Borda\ncount, formally defined later, avoids Condorcet's paradox\nbut violates one of Arrow's conditions, the independence of\nirrelevant alternatives. Thus the debate between Condorcet and\nBorda is a precursor to some modern debates on how to respond to\nArrow's theorem.  \n\nThe origins of this debate precede Condorcet and Borda. In the\nMiddle Ages, Ramon Llull (c1235–1315) proposed the aggregation method\nof pairwise majority voting, while Nicolas Cusanus (1401–1464) proposed\na variant of the Borda count (McLean 1990). In 1672, the German\nstatesman and scholar Samuel von Pufendorf (1632–1694) compared simple\nmajority, qualified majority, and unanimity rules and offered an\nanalysis of the structure of preferences that can be seen as a\nprecursor to later discoveries (e.g., on single-peakedness,\ndiscussed below) (Gaertner 2005). \n\nIn the 19th century, the British mathematician and\nclergyman Charles Dodgson (1832–1898), better known as Lewis Carroll,\nindependently rediscovered many of Condorcet's and Borda's\ninsights and also developed a theory of proportional representation. It\nwas largely thanks to the Scottish economist Duncan Black (1908–1991)\nthat Condorcet's, Borda's, and Dodgson's\nsocial-choice-theoretic ideas were drawn to the attention of the modern\nresearch community (McLean, McMillan, and Monroe 1995). Black also made\nseveral discoveries related to majority voting, some of which are\ndiscussed below. \n\nIn France, George-Théodule Guilbaud ([1952] 1966) wrote an\nimportant but often overlooked paper, revisiting Condorcet's\ntheory of voting from a logical perspective and sparking a French\nliterature on the Condorcet effect, the logical problem\nunderlying Condorcet's paradox, which has only recently received\nmore attention in Anglophone social choice theory (Monjardet 2005). For\nfurther contributions on the history of social choice theory, see McLean,\nMcMillan, and Monroe (1996), McLean and Urken (1995), McLean and Hewitt\n(1994), and a special issue of Social Choice and Welfare,\nedited by Salles (2005). \n\nTo introduce social choice theory formally, it helps to consider a\nsimple decision problem: a collective choice between two\nalternatives. \n\nLet N = {1, 2, …, n} be a set of\nindividuals, where n ≥ 2. The individuals have to choose\nbetween two alternatives (candidates, policies etc.). Each individual\ni ∈ N casts a vote, denoted\nvi, where \n\nA combination of votes across the individuals,\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, is called a profile. For any\nprofile, the group seeks to arrive at a social decision v,\nwhere \n\nAn aggregation rule is a function f that assigns\nto each profile <v1, v2,\n…, vn> (in some domain of admissible\nprofiles) a social decision v =\nf(v1, v2, …,\nvn). Examples are: \n\nMajority rule: For each profile\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, \n\nDictatorship: For each profile\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, \n\nf(v1, v2, …,\nvn) = vi, \nwhere i ∈ N is an antecedently fixed\nindividual (the ‘dictator’).  \n\nWeighted majority rule: For each profile\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, \n\nwhere w1, w2, …,\nwn are real numbers, interpreted as the\n‘voting weights’ of the n individuals. \n\nTwo points about the concept of an aggregation rule are worth\nnoting. First, under the standard definition, an aggregation rule is\ndefined extensionally, not intensionally: it is a\nmapping (functional relationship) between individual\ninputs and collective outputs, not a set of explicit\ninstructions (a rule in the ordinary-language sense) that\ncould be extended to inputs outside the function's formal domain.\nSecondly, an aggregation rule is defined for a fixed set of individuals\nN and a fixed decision problem, so that majority rule in a\ngroup of two individuals is a different mathematical object from\nmajority rule in a group of three. \n\nTo illustrate, Tables 1 and 2 show majority rule for these two group\nsizes as extensional objects. The rows of each table correspond to the\ndifferent possible profiles of votes; the final column displays the\nresulting social decisions. \n\nThe present way of representing an aggregation rule helps us see how\nmany possible aggregation rules there are (see also List 2011). Suppose\nthere are k profiles in the domain of admissible inputs (in\nthe present example, \nk = 2n, since each of\nthe n individuals has two choices, with abstention\ndisallowed). Suppose, further, there are l possible social\ndecisions for each profile (in the example, \nl = 3, allowing\nties). Then there are lk possible aggregation\nrules: the relevant table has k rows, and in each row, there\nare l possible ways of specifying the final entry (the\ncollective decision). Thus the number of possible aggregation rules\ngrows exponentially with the number of admissible profiles and the\nnumber of possible decision outcomes. \n\nTo select an aggregation rule non-arbitrarily from this large class\nof possible ones, some constraints are needed. I now consider three\nformal arguments for majority rule. \n\nThe first involves imposing some ‘procedural’\nrequirements on the relationship between individual votes and social\ndecisions and showing that majority rule is the only aggregation rule\nsatisfying them. May (1952) introduced four such requirements: \n\nUniversal domain: The domain of admissible inputs of the\naggregation rule consists of all logically possible profiles of votes\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, where each \nvi ∈ {−1,1}. \n\nAnonymity: For any admissible profiles\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn> and <w1,\nw2, …, wn> that\nare permutations of each other (i.e., one can be obtained from the\nother by reordering the entries), the social decision is the same,\ni.e., f(v1, v2,\n…, vn) = f(w1,\nw2, …, wn). \n\nNeutrality: For any admissible profile\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, if the votes for the two alternatives\nare reversed, the social decision is reversed too, i.e.,\nf(−v1, −v2,\n…, −vn) =\n−f(v1, v2,\n…, vn). \n\nPositive responsiveness: For any admissible profile\n<v1, v2, …,\nvn>, if some voters change their votes in\nfavour of one alternative (say the first) and all other votes remain\nthe same, the social decision does not change in the opposite\ndirection; if the social decision was a tie prior to the change, the\ntie is broken in the direction of the change, i.e., if\n[wi > vi for some\ni and wj = vj for all\nother j] and f(v1,\nv2, …, vn) = 0 or 1,\nthen f(w1, w2,\n…, wn) = 1. \n\nUniversal domain requires the aggregation rule to cope with any\nlevel of ‘pluralism’ in its inputs; anonymity requires it\nto treat all voters equally; neutrality requires it to treat all\nalternatives equally; and positive responsiveness requires the social\ndecision to be a positive function of the way people vote. May proved\nthe following: \n\nTheorem (May 1952): An aggregation rule satisfies universal\ndomain, anonymity, neutrality, and positive responsiveness if and only\nif it is majority rule. \n\nApart from providing an argument for majority rule based on four\nplausible procedural desiderata, the theorem helps us characterize\nother aggregation rules in terms of which desiderata they violate.\nDictatorships and weighted majority rules with unequal individual\nweights violate anonymity. Asymmetrical supermajority rules (under\nwhich a supermajority of the votes, such as two thirds or three\nquarters, is required for a decision in favour of one of the\nalternatives, while the other alternative is the default choice)\nviolate neutrality. This may sometimes be justifiable, for instance\nwhen there is a presumption in favour of one alternative, such as a\npresumption of innocence in a jury decision. Symmetrical supermajority\nrules (under which neither alternative is chosen unless it is supported\nby a sufficiently large supermajority) violate positive responsiveness.\nA more far-fetched example of an aggregation rule violating positive\nresponsiveness is the inverse majority rule (here the alternative\nrejected by a majority wins). \n\nCondorcet's jury theorem provides a consequentialist argument\nfor majority rule. The argument is ‘epistemic’, insofar as\nthe aggregation rule is interpreted as a truth-tracking device (e.g.,\nGrofman, Owen and Feld 1983; List and Goodin 2001).  \n\nSuppose the aim is to make a judgment on some procedure-independent\nfact or state of the world, denoted X. In a jury decision, the\ndefendant is either guilty (X = 1) or innocent (X =\n−1). In an expert-panel decision on the safety of some technology, the\ntechnology may be either safe (X = 1) or not (X =\n−1). Each individual's vote expresses a judgment on that fact or\nstate, and the social decision represents the collective judgment. The\ngoal is to reach a factually correct collective judgment. Which\naggregation rule performs best at ‘tracking the truth’ depends\non the relationship between the individual votes and the relevant fact\nor state of the world. \n\nCondorcet assumed that each individual is better than random at\nmaking a correct judgment (the competence assumption) and that\ndifferent individuals' judgments are stochastically independent,\ngiven the state of the world (the independence assumption). Formally,\nlet V1, V2, …,\nVn (capital letters) denote the random variables\ngenerating the specific individual votes v1,\nv2, …, vn (small\nletters), and let V = f(V1,\nV2, …, Vn) denote the\nresulting random variable representing the social decision v =\nf(v1, v2,\n…, vn) under a given aggregation rule\nf, such as majority rule. Condorcet's assumptions can be\nstated as follows: \n\nCompetence: For each individual i ∈\nN and each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1},\nPr(Vi = x |\nX = x) =\np > 1/2, where p is the same across\nindividuals and states. \n\nIndependence: The votes of different individuals\nV1, V2, …,\nVn are independent of each other, conditional on\neach value x ∈ {−1,1} of X. \n\nUnder these assumptions, majority voting is a good\ntruth-tracker: \n\nTheorem (Condorcet's jury theorem): For each state of\nthe world x ∈ {−1,1}, the probability of a correct\nmajority decision, Pr(V = x |\nX =\nx), is greater than each individual's probability of a\ncorrect vote, \nPr(Vi = x |\nX =\nx), and converges to 1, as the number of individuals\nn\n increases.[1] \n\nThe first conjunct (‘is greater than each individual's\nprobability’) is the non-asymptotic conclusion, the\nsecond (‘converges to 1’) the asymptotic\nconclusion. One can further show that, if the two states of the\nworld have an equal prior probability (i.e., Pr(X = 1) =\nPr(X = −1) = 1/2), majority rule is the most reliable of all\naggregation rules, maximizing Pr(V = X) (e.g.,\nBen-Yashar and Nitzan 1997). \n\nAlthough the jury theorem is often invoked to establish the\nepistemic merits of democracy, its assumptions are highly idealistic.\nThe competence assumption is not a conceptual claim but an empirical\none and depends on any given decision problem. Although an average (not\nnecessarily equal) individual competence above 1/2 may be sufficient\nfor Condorcet's conclusion (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983;\nBoland 1989; Kanazawa\n 1998),[2]\nthe theorem ceases to hold if individuals are randomizers (no better\nand no worse than a coin toss) or if they are worse than random\n(p < 1/2). In the latter case, the probability of a\ncorrect majority decision is less than each individual's\nprobability of a correct vote and converges to 0, as the jury size\nincreases. The theorem's conclusion can also be undermined in\nless extreme cases (Berend and Paroush 1998), for instance when each\nindividual's reliability, though above 1/2, is an exponentially\ndecreasing function approaching 1/2 with increasing jury size (List\n2003a). \n\nSimilarly, whether the independence assumption is true depends on\nthe decision problem in question. Although Condorcet's conclusion\nis robust to the presence of some interdependencies between individual\nvotes, the structure of these interdependencies matters (e.g., Boland\n1989; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1994; Dietrich and List 2004; Berend and\nSapir 2007; Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013). If all individuals'\nvotes are perfectly correlated with one another or mimic a small number\nof opinion leaders, the collective judgment is no more reliable than\nthe judgment among a small number of independent individuals. \n\nBayesian networks, as employed in Pearl's work on causation\n(2000), have been used to model the effects of voter dependencies on\nthe jury theorem and to distinguish between stronger and weaker\nvariants of conditional independence (Dietrich and List 2004; Dietrich\nand Spiekermann 2013). Dietrich (2008) has argued that\nCondorcet's two assumptions are never simultaneously justified,\nin the sense that, even when they are both true, one cannot obtain\nevidence to support both at once. \n\nFinally, game-theoretic work challenges an implicit assumption of\nthe jury theorem, namely that voters will always reveal their judgments\ntruthfully. Even if all voters prefer a correct to an incorrect\ncollective judgment, they may still have incentives to misrepresent\ntheir individual judgments. This can happen when, conditional on the\nevent of being pivotal for the outcome, a voter expects a higher chance\nof bringing about a correct collective judgment by voting\nagainst his or her own private judgment than in line with it\n(Austin-Smith and Banks 1996; Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998). \n\nAnother consequentialist argument for majority rule is utilitarian\nrather than epistemic. It does not require the existence of an\nindependent fact or state of the world that the collective decision is\nsupposed to track. Suppose each voter gets some utility from the\ncollective decision, which depends on whether the decision matches his\nor her vote (preference): specifically, each voter gets a utility of 1\nfrom a match between his or her vote and the collective outcome and a\nutility of 0 from a\n mismatch.[3]\nThe Rae-Taylor theorem then states that if each individual has an equal\nprior probability of preferring each of the two alternatives, majority\nrule maximizes each individual's expected utility (see, e.g.,\nMueller 2003). \n\nRelatedly, majority rule minimizes the number of frustrated voters\n(defined as voters on the losing side) and maximizes total utility\nacross voters. Brighouse and Fleurbaey (2010) generalize this result.\nDefine voter i's stake in the decision,\ndi, as the utility difference between his\nor her preferred outcome and his or her dispreferred outcome. The\nRae-Taylor theorem rests on an implicit equal-stakes assumption, i.e.,\ndi = 1 for every i ∈\nN. Brighouse and Fleurbaey show that when stakes are allowed\nto vary across voters, total utility is maximized not by majority rule,\nbut by a weighted majority rule, where each individual\ni's voting weight wi is proportional\nto his or her stake di. \n\nAt the heart of social choice theory is the analysis of preference\naggregation, understood as the aggregation of several\nindividuals' preference rankings of two or more social\nalternatives into a single, collective preference ranking (or choice)\nover these alternatives. \n\nThe basic model is as follows. Again, consider a set N =\n{1, 2, …, n} of individuals (n ≥ 2). Let\nX = {x, y, z, …} be a set of\nsocial alternatives, for example possible worlds, policy platforms,\nelection candidates, or allocations of goods. Each individual\ni ∈ N has a preference ordering\nRi over these alternatives: a complete and\n transitive binary relation on X.[4]\nFor any x, y ∈ X,\nxRiy means that individual i weakly\nprefers x to y. We write xPiy if\nxRiy and not yRix\n(‘individual i strictly prefers x to\ny’), and xIiy if\nxRiy and yRix\n(‘individual i is indifferent between x and\ny’). \n\nA combination of preference orderings across the individuals,\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn>, is called a profile. A\npreference aggregation rule, F, is a function that\nassigns to each profile <R1,\nR2, …, Rn> (in\nsome domain of admissible profiles) a social preference relation\nR = F(R1, R2,\n…, Rn) on X. When F is\nclear from the context, we simply write R for the social\npreference relation corresponding to <R1,\nR2, …, Rn>. \n\nFor any x, y ∈ X, xRy\nmeans that x is socially weakly preferred to y. We\nalso write xPy if xRy and not yRx\n(‘x is strictly socially preferred to\ny’), and xIy if xRy and yRx\n(‘x and y are socially tied’). For\ngenerality, the requirement that R be complete and transitive\nis not built into the definition of a preference aggregation rule. \n\nThe paradigmatic example of a preference aggregation rule is\npairwise majority voting, as discussed by Condorcet. Here, for\nany profile <R1, R2,\n…, Rn> and any x, y\n∈ X, xRy if and only if at least as many\nindividuals have xRiy as have\nyRix, formally \n|{i ∈ N :\nxRiy}| ≥ \n|{i ∈ N : yRix}|. As we have seen, this does not guarantee\ntransitive social\n preferences.[5] \n\nHow frequent are intransitive majority preferences? It can be shown\nthat the proportion of preference profiles (among all possible ones)\nthat lead to cyclical majority preferences increases with the number of\nindividuals (n) and the number of alternatives (|X|).\nIf all possible preference profiles are equally likely to occur (the\nso-called ‘impartial culture’ scenario), majority cycles\nshould therefore be probable in large electorates (Gehrlein 1983).\n(Technical work further distinguishes between ‘top-cycles’\nand cycles below a possible Condorcet-winning alternative.) However,\nthe probability of cycles can be significantly lower under certain\nsystematic, even small, deviations from an impartial culture (List and\nGoodin 2001: Appendix 3; Tsetlin, Regenwetter, and Grofman 2003;\nRegenwetter et al. 2006). \n\nAbstracting from pairwise majority voting, Arrow introduced the\nfollowing conditions on a preference aggregation rule, F. \n\nUniversal domain: The domain of F is the set of\nall logically possible profiles of complete and transitive individual\npreference orderings. \n\nOrdering: For any profile <R1,\nR2, …, Rn> in the\ndomain of F, the social preference relation R is\ncomplete and transitive. \n\nWeak Pareto principle: For any profile\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> in the domain of F, if for all\ni ∈ N xPiy, then\nxPy. \n\nIndependence of irrelevant alternatives: For any two\nprofiles <R1, R2,\n…, Rn> and\n<R*1, R*2, …,\nR*n> in the domain of F and any\nx, y ∈ X, if for all i\n∈ N Ri's ranking between x and y coincides with R*i's ranking between x and y, then xRy if and only if xR*y. \n\nNon-dictatorship: There does not exist an individual\ni ∈ N such that, for all\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> in the domain of F and all\nx, y ∈ X, xPiy\nimplies xPy. \n\nUniversal domain requires the aggregation rule to cope with any\nlevel of ‘pluralism’ in its inputs. Ordering requires it to\nproduce ‘rational’ social preferences, avoiding Condorcet\ncycles. The weak Pareto principle requires that when all individuals\nstrictly prefer alternative x to alternative y, so\ndoes society. Independence of irrelevant alternatives requires that the\nsocial preference between any two alternatives x and\ny depend only on the individual preferences between x\nand y, not on individuals' preferences over other\nalternatives. Non-dictatorship requires that there be no\n‘dictator’, who always determines the social preference,\nregardless of other individuals' preferences. (Note that pairwise\nmajority voting satisfies all of these conditions except ordering.) \n\nTheorem (Arrow 1951/1963): If |X| > 2,\nthere exists no preference aggregation rule satisfying universal\ndomain, ordering, the weak Pareto principle, independence of irrelevant\nalternatives, and non-dictatorship. \n\nIt is evident that this result carries over to the aggregation of\nother kinds of orderings, as distinct from preference orderings, such\nas (i) belief orderings over several hypotheses (ordinal credences),\n(ii) multiple criteria that a single decision maker may use to generate\nan all-things-considered ordering of several decision options, and\n(iii) conflicting value rankings to be reconciled. \n\nExamples of other such aggregation problems to which Arrow's\ntheorem has been applied include: intrapersonal aggregation problems\n(e.g., May 1954; Hurley 1985), constraint aggregation in optimality\ntheory in linguistics (e.g., Harbour and List 2000), theory choice\n(e.g., Okasha 2011; cf. Morreau forthcoming), evidence amalgamation\n(e.g., Stegenga 2013), and the aggregation of multiple similarity\norderings into an all-things-considered similarity ordering (e.g.,\nMorreau 2010; Kroedel and Huber 2013). In each case, the plausibility\nof Arrow's theorem depends on the case-specific plausibility of\nArrow's ordinalist framework and the theorem's\nconditions. \n\nGenerally, if we consider Arrow's framework appropriate and\nhis conditions indispensable, Arrow's theorem raises a serious\nchallenge. To avoid it, we must relax at least one of the five\nconditions or give up the restriction of the aggregation rule's\ninputs to orderings and defend the use of richer inputs, as discussed\nin Section 4. \n\nOne way to avoid Arrow's theorem is to relax universal domain.\nIf the aggregation rule is required to accept as input only preference\nprofiles that satisfy certain ‘cohesion’ conditions, then\naggregation rules such as pairwise majority voting will produce\ncomplete and transitive social preferences. The best-known cohesion\ncondition is single-peakedness (Black 1948). \n\nA profile <R1, R2,\n…, Rn> is single-peaked if\nthe alternatives can be aligned from ‘left’ to\n‘right’ (e.g., on some cognitive or ideological dimension)\nsuch that each individual has a most preferred position on that\nalignment with decreasing preference as alternatives get more distant\n(in either direction) from the most preferred position. Formally, this\nrequires the existence of a linear ordering Ω on \nX such that, for every triple of alternatives x,\ny, z ∈ X, if y lies between\nx and z with respect to Ω, it is not the case that\nxRiy and zRix (this rules out a\n‘cave’ between x and z, at y).\nSingle-peakedness is plausible in some democratic contexts. If the\nalternatives in X are different tax rates, for example, each\nindividual may have a most preferred tax rate (which will be lower for\na libertarian individual than for a socialist) and prefer other tax\nrates less as they get more distant from the ideal. \n\nBlack (1948) proved that if the domain of the aggregation rule is\nrestricted to the set of all profiles of individual preference\norderings satisfying single-peakedness, majority cycles cannot occur,\nand the most preferred alternative of the median individual relative to\nthe relevant left-right alignment is a Condorcet winner (assuming\nn is odd). Pairwise majority voting then satisfies the rest of\nArrow's conditions. \n\nOther domain-restriction conditions with similar implications\ninclude single-cavedness, a geometrical mirror image of\nsingle-peakedness (Inada 1964), separability into two groups\n(ibid.), and latin-squarelessness (Ward 1965), the latter two\nmore complicated combinatorial conditions (for a review, see Gaertner\n2001). Sen (1966) showed that all these conditions imply a weaker\ncondition, triple-wise value-restriction. It requires that,\nfor every triple of alternatives x, y, z\n∈ X, there exists one alternative in {x,\ny, z} and one rank r ∈ {1, 2, 3} such\nthat no individual ranks that alternative in rth\nplace among x, y, and z. For instance, all\nindividuals may agree that y is not bottom (r = 3)\namong x, y, and z. Triple-wise\nvalue-restriction suffices for transitive majority preferences (for a simple proof of Sen's theorem, see Elsholtz and List 2005). \n\nThere has been much discussion on whether, and under what\nconditions, real-world preferences fall into such a restricted domain.\nIt has been suggested, for example, that group deliberation can induce\nsingle-peaked preferences, by leading participants to focus on a shared\ncognitive or ideological dimension (Miller 1992; Knight and Johnson\n1994; Dryzek and List 2003). Experimental evidence from deliberative\nopinion polls is consistent with this hypothesis (List, Luskin,\nFishkin, and McLean 2013), though further empirical work is needed. \n\nPreference aggregation rules are normally expected to produce\norderings as their outputs, but sometimes we may only require partial\norderings or not fully transitive binary relations. An aggregation rule\nthat produces transitive but often incomplete social preferences is the\nPareto dominance procedure: here, for any profile\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> and any x, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if, for all i ∈\nN, xPiy. An aggregation rule that produces\ncomplete but often intransitive social preferences is the Pareto\nextension procedure: here, for any profile\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> and any x, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if it is not the case that, for\nall i ∈ N, yPix. Both rules\nhave a unanimitarian spirit, giving each individual veto power either\nagainst the presence of a weak social preference for\nx over y or against its absence. \n\nGibbard (1969) proved that even if we replace the requirement of\ntransitivity with what he called quasi-transitivity, the\nresulting possibilities of aggregation are still very limited. Call a\npreference relation R quasi-transitive if the induced\nstrict relation P is transitive (while the indifference\nrelation I need not be transitive). Call an aggregation rule\noligarchic if there is a subset M ⊆ N\n(the ‘oligarchs’) such that (i) if, for all i\n∈ M, xPiy, then xPy, and\n(ii) if, for some i ∈ M,\nxPiy, then xRy. The Pareto extension\nprocedure is an example of an oligarchic aggregation rule with\nM = N. In an oligarchy, the oligarchs are jointly\ndecisive and have individual veto power. Gibbard proved the\nfollowing: \n\nTheorem (Gibbard 1969): If |X| > 2, there\nexists no preference aggregation rule satisfying universal domain,\nquasi-transitivity and completeness of social preferences, the weak\nPareto principle, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and\nnon-oligarchy. \n\nThe weak Pareto principle is arguably hard to give up. One case in\nwhich we may lift it is that of spurious unanimity, where a unanimous\npreference for x over y is based on mutually\ninconsistent reasons (e.g., Mongin 1997; Gilboa, Samet, and Schmeidler\n2004). Two men may each prefer to fight a duel (alternative x)\nto not fighting it (alternative y) because each over-estimates\nhis chances of winning. There may exist no mutually agreeable\nprobability assignment over possible outcomes of the duel (i.e., who\nwould win) that would ‘rationalize’ the unanimous\npreference for x over y. In this case, the unanimous\npreference is a bad indicator of social preferability. This\nexample, however, depends on the fact that the alternatives of fighting\nand not fighting are not fully specified outcomes but uncertain\nprospects. Arguably, the weak Pareto principle is more plausible in\ncases without uncertainty. \n\nAn aggregation rule that becomes possible when the weak Pareto\nprinciple is dropped is an imposed procedure, where, for any\nprofile <R1, R2,\n…, Rn>, the social preference\nrelation R is an antecedently fixed (‘imposed’)\nordering Rimposed of the alternatives. Though\ncompletely unresponsive to individual preferences, this aggregation\nrule satisfies the rest of Arrow's conditions. \n\nSen (1970a) offered another critique of the weak Pareto principle,\nshowing that it conflicts with a ‘liberal’ principle. Here\nwe interpret the aggregation rule as a method a social planner can use\nto rank social alternatives in an order of social welfare. Suppose each\nindividual in society is given some basic rights, to the effect that\nhis or her preference is sometimes socially decisive (i.e., cannot be\noverridden by others' preferences). Each of Lewd and Prude, for\nexample, should be decisive over whether he himself reads a particular\nbook, Lady Chatterley's Lover. \n\nMinimal liberalism: There are at least two\ndistinct individuals i, j ∈ N who are\neach decisive on at least one pair of alternatives; i.e., there is at\nleast one pair of alternatives x, y ∈\nX such that, for every profile <R1,\nR2, …, Rn>,\nxPiy implies xPy, and\nyPix implies yPx, and at least one pair of\nalternatives x*, y* ∈ X such that, for\nevery profile <R1, R2,\n…, Rn>, x*Pjy*\nimplies x*Py*, and y*Pjx* implies\ny*Px*. \n\nSen asked us to imagine that Lewd most prefers that Prude read the\nbook (alternative x), second-most prefers that he read the\nbook himself (alternative y), and least prefers that neither\nread the book (z). Prude most prefers that neither read the\nbook (z), second-most prefers that he read the book himself\n(x), and least prefers that Lewd read the book (y).\nAssuming Lewd is decisive over the pair y and z,\nsociety should prefer y to z. Assuming Prude is\ndecisive over the pair x and z, society should prefer\nz to x. But since Lewd and Prude both prefer\nx to y, the weak Pareto principle (applied to\nN = {Lewd, Prude}) implies that society should prefer\nx to y. So, we are faced with a social preference\ncycle. Sen called this problem the ‘liberal paradox’ and\ngeneralized it as follows. \n\nTheorem (Sen 1970a): There exists no preference aggregation\nrule satisfying universal domain, acyclicity of social preferences, the\nweak Pareto principle, and minimal liberalism. \n\nThe result suggests that if we wish to respect individual rights, we\nmay sometimes have to sacrifice Paretian efficiency. An alternative\nconclusion is that the weak Pareto principle can be rendered compatible\nwith minimal liberalism only when the domain of admissible preference\nprofiles is suitably restricted, for instance to preferences that are\n‘tolerant’ or not ‘meddlesome’ (Blau 1975;\nCraven 1982; Gigliotti 1986; Sen 1983). Lewd's and Prude's\npreferences in Sen's example are ‘meddlesome’. \n\nSeveral authors have challenged the relevance of Sen's result,\nhowever, by criticizing his formalization of rights (e.g., Gaertner,\nPattanaik, and Suzumura 1992; Dowding and van Hees 2003). \n\nA common way to obtain possible preference aggregation rules is to\ngive up independence of irrelevant alternatives. Almost all familiar\nvoting methods over three or more alternatives that involve some form\nof preferential voting (with voters being asked to express full or\npartial preference orderings) violate this condition. \n\nA standard example is plurality rule: here, for any profile\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> and any x, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if |{i ∈ N\n: for all z ≠ x, xPiz}|\n≥ |{i ∈ N : for all z ≠\ny, yPiz}|. Informally, alternatives are\nsocially ranked in the order of how many individuals most prefer each\nof them. Plurality rule avoids Condorcet's paradox, but runs into\nother problems. Most notably, an alternative that is\nmajority-dispreferred to every other alternative may win under\nplurality rule: if 34% of the voters rank x above y\nabove z, 33% rank y above z above\nx, and 33% rank z above y above x,\nplurality rule ranks x above each of y and\nz, while pairwise majority voting would rank y above\nz above x (y is the Condorcet winner). By\ndisregarding individuals' lower-ranked alternatives, plurality\nrule also violates the weak Pareto principle. However, plurality rule\nmay be plausible in ‘restricted informational\nenvironments’, where the balloting procedure collects information\nonly about voters' top preferences, not about their full\npreference rankings. Here plurality rule satisfies generalized variants\nof May's four conditions introduced above (Goodin and List\n2006). \n\nA second example of a preference aggregation rule that violates\nindependence of irrelevant alternatives is the Borda count\n(e.g., Saari 1990). Here, for any profile\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> and any x, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if\nΣi∈N|{z\n∈ X : xRiz}| ≥\nΣi∈N|{z\n∈ X : yRiz}|. Informally, each voter\nassigns a score to each alternative, which depends on its rank in his\nor her preference ranking. The most-preferred alternative gets a score\nof k (where k = |X|), the\nsecond-most-preferred alternative a score of \nk − 1, the\nthird-most-preferred alternative a score of \nk − 2, and so\non. Alternatives are then socially ordered in terms of the sums of\ntheir scores across voters: the alternative with the largest sum-total\nis top, the alternative with the second-largest sum-total next, and so\non. \n\nTo see how this violates independence of irrelevant alternatives,\nconsider the two profiles of individual preference orderings over four\nalternatives (x, y, z, w) in Tables\n3 and 4. \n\nIn Table 3, the Borda scores of the four alternatives are: \n\nleading to a social preference for z over x over\ny over w. In Table 4 the Borda scores are: \n\nleading to a social preference for x over z over\ny over w. The only difference between the two\nprofiles lies in Individual 1's preference ordering, and even\nhere there is no change in the relative ranking of x and\nz. Despite identical individual preferences between x\nand z in Tables 3 and 4, the social preference between\nx and z is reversed, a violation of independence of\nirrelevant alternatives.  \n\nSuch violations are common in real-world voting rules, and they make\npreference aggregation potentially vulnerable to strategic voting\nand/or strategic agenda setting. I illustrate this in the case of\nstrategic voting. \n\nSo far we have discussed preference aggregation rules,\nwhich map profiles of individual preference orderings to social\npreference relations. We now consider social choice rules,\nwhose output, instead, is one or several winning alternatives.\nFormally, a social choice rule, f, is a function that\nassigns to each profile <R1,\nR2, …, Rn> (in\nsome domain of admissible profiles) a social choice set\nf(R1, R2, …,\nRn) ⊆ X. A social choice rule\nf can be derived from a preference aggregation rule\nF, by defining f(R1,\nR2, …, Rn) = {x\n∈ X : for all y ∈\nX, xRy} where R =\nF(R1, R2, …,\nRn); the reverse does not generally hold. We call\nthe set of sometimes-chosen alternatives the range of\n f.[6] \n\nThe Condorcet winner criterion defines a social choice\nrule, where, for each profile <R1,\nR2, …, Rn>,\nf(R1, R2, …,\nRn) contains every alternative in X that\nwins or at least ties with every other alternative in pairwise majority\nvoting. As shown by Condorcet's paradox, this may produce an\nempty choice set. By contrast, plurality rule and the Borda count\ninduce social choice rules that always produce non-empty choice sets.\nThey also satisfy the following basic conditions (the last for |X| ≥ 3): \n\nUniversal Domain: The domain of f is the set of\nall logically possible profiles of complete and transitive individual\npreference orderings. \n\nNon-dictatorship: There does not exist an individual\ni ∈ N such that, for all\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> in the domain of f and all\nx in the range of f, yRix where\ny ∈ f(R1,\n R2, …, Rn).[7] \n\nThe range constraint: The range of f contains at\nleast three distinct alternatives (and ideally all alternatives in\nX). \n\nWhen supplemented with an appropriate tie-breaking criterion, the\nplurality and Borda rules can further be made\n‘resolute’: \n\nResoluteness: The social choice rule f always\nproduces a unique winning alternative (a singleton choice set). (We\nthen write x = f(R1,\nR2, …, Rn) to denote the\nwinning alternative for the profile <R1,\nR2, …, Rn>.) \n\nSurprisingly, this list of conditions conflicts with the following\nfurther requirement. \n\nStrategy-proofness: There does not exist a profile\n<R1, R2, …,\nRn> in the domain of f at which\nf is manipulable by some individual \ni ∈ N, where manipulability means the following: if\ni submits a false preference ordering\nR′i (≠ Ri), the winner\nis an alternative y′ that i strictly prefers\n(according to Ri) to the alternative y\nthat would win if i submitted the true preference\n ordering Ri.[8] \n\nTheorem (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite 1975): There exists no\nsocial choice rule satisfying universal domain, non-dictatorship, the\nrange constraint, resoluteness, and strategy-proofness. \n\nThis result raises important questions about the trade-offs between\ndifferent requirements on a social choice rule. A dictatorship, which\nalways chooses the dictator's most preferred alternative, is\ntrivially strategy-proof. The dictator obviously has no incentive to\nvote strategically, and no-one else does so either, since the outcome\ndepends only on the dictator. \n\nTo see that the Borda count violates strategy-proofness, recall the\nexample of Tables 3 and 4 above. If Individual 1 in Table 3 truthfully\nsubmits the preference ordering\nyP1xP1zP1w,\nthe Borda winner is z, as we have seen. If Individual 1\nfalsely submits the preference ordering\nxP1yP1wP1z,\nas in Table 4, the Borda winner is x. But Individual 1 prefers\nx to z according to his or her true preference\nordering (in Table 3), and so he or she has an incentive to vote\nstrategically. \n\nMoulin (1980) has shown that when the domain of the social choice\nrule is restricted to single-peaked preference profiles, pairwise\nmajority voting and other so-called ‘median voting’ schemes\ncan satisfy the rest of the conditions of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite\ntheorem. Similarly, when collective decisions are restricted to binary\nchoices alone, which amounts to dropping the range constraint, majority\nvoting satisfies the rest of the conditions. Other possible escape\nroutes from the theorem open up if resoluteness is dropped. In the\nlimiting case in which all alternatives are always chosen, the other\nconditions are vacuously satisfied. \n\nThe requirement of strategy-proofness has been challenged too. One\nline of argument is that, even when there exist strategic incentives in\nthe technical sense of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, individuals\nwill not necessarily act on them. They would require detailed\ninformation about others' preferences and enough computational\npower to figure out what the optimal strategically modified preferences\nwould be. Neither demand is generally met. Bartholdi, Tovey, and Trick\n(1989) showed that, due to computational complexity, some social choice\nrules are resistant to strategic manipulation: it may be an NP-hard\nproblem for a voter to determine how to vote strategically. In this vein, Harrison\nand McDaniel (2008) provide experimental evidence suggesting that the\n‘Kemeny rule’, an extension of pairwise majority voting\ndesigned to avoid Condorcet cycles, is ‘behaviourally\nincentive-compatible’: i.e., strategic manipulation is\ncomputationally hard. \n\nDowding and van Hees (2008) have argued that not all forms of\nstrategic voting are normatively problematic. They distinguish between\n‘sincere’ and ‘insincere’ forms of manipulation\nand argue that only the latter but not the former are normatively\ntroublesome. Sincere manipulation occurs when a voter (i) votes for a compromise\nalternative whose chances of winning are thereby increased and (ii)\ngenuinely prefers that compromise alternative to the alternative that would\notherwise win. For example, in the 2000 US presidential election, supporters of Ralph Nader (a third-party candidate with little chance of winning) who voted for Al Gore to increase his chances of beating George W. Bush engaged in sincere manipulation in the sense of (i) and (ii). Plurality rule is susceptible to sincere manipulation, but not vulnerable to insincere manipulation. \n\nAn implicit assumption so far has been that preferences are ordinal\nand not interpersonally comparable: preference orderings contain no\ninformation about each individual's strength of preference or\nabout how to compare different individuals' preferences with one\nanother. Statements such as ‘Individual 1 prefers alternative\nx more than Individual 2 prefers alternative y’\nor ‘Individual l prefers a switch from x to y\nmore than Individual 2 prefers a switch from x* to\ny*’ are considered meaningless. \nIn voting contexts, this assumption may be plausible, but in\nwelfare-evaluation contexts—when a social planner seeks to rank\ndifferent social alternatives in an order of social welfare—the\nuse of richer information may be justified. Sen (1970b) generalized\nArrow's model to incorporate such richer information. \n\nAs before, consider a set N = {1, 2, …, n}\nof individuals (n ≥ 2) and a set X =\n{x, y, z, …} of social alternatives.\nNow each individual \ni ∈ N has a welfare\nfunction Wi over these alternatives, which\nassigns a real number Wi(x) to each\nalternative \nx ∈ X, interpreted as a measure of\ni's welfare under alternative x. Any welfare\nfunction on X induces an ordering on X, but the\nconverse is not true: welfare functions encode more information. A\ncombination of welfare functions across the individuals,\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn>, is called a profile. \n\nA social welfare functional (SWFL), also denoted\nF, is a function that assigns to each profile\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> (in some domain of admissible profiles)\na social preference relation R =\nF(W1, W2, …,\nWn) on X, with the familiar\ninterpretation. Again, when F is clear from the context, we\nwrite R for the social preference relation corresponding to\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn>. The output of a SWFL is\nsimilar to that of a preference aggregation rule (again, we do not\nbuild the completeness or transitivity of R into\nthe\n definition[9]),\nbut its\ninput is richer. \n\nWhat we gain from this depends on how much of the enriched\ninformational input we allow ourselves to use in determining\nsociety's preferences: technically, it depends on our assumption\nabout measurability and interpersonal comparability of welfare. \n\nBy assigning real numbers to alternatives, welfare profiles contain a lot of information over and above the profiles of orderings on X they induce. In particular, many different assignments of numbers to alternatives can give rise to the same orderings.  But we may not consider all this information meaningful. Some of it could be an artifact of the numerical representation. For example, the difference\nbetween the profile <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\nits scaled-up version <10*W1,\n10*W2, …, 10*Wn>,\nwhere everything is the same in proportional terms, could be like the\ndifference between length measurements in centimeters and in\ninches. The two profiles might be seen as alternative representations of the exact same information, just on different scales. \n\nTo express different assumptions about which information is truly encoded by a profile of welfare functions and which information is not (and should thus be seen, at best, as an artifact of the numerical representation), it is helpful to introduce the notion of meaningful statements. Some examples of statements about individual welfare that are candidates for meaningful statements are the following (List 2003b; see also Bossert and Weymark 1996: Section 5): \n\nA level comparison: Individual i's welfare\nunder alternative x is at least as great as individual\nj's welfare under alternative y, formally\nWi(x) ≥\nWj(y). (The comparison is intrapersonal if i = j, and interpersonal if i ≠ j.) \n\nA unit comparison: The ratio of [individual\ni's welfare gain or loss if we switch from alternative\ny1 to alternative x1] to\n[individual j's welfare gain or loss if we switch from\nalternative y2 to alternative\nx2] is λ, where\nλ is some real\nnumber, formally (x1 −\ny1) / (x2 −\ny2) = λ. (Again, the comparison is intrapersonal if i = j, and interpersonal if i ≠ j.) \n\nA zero comparison: Individual i's welfare\nunder alternative x is greater than / equal to / less than\nzero, formally sign(Wi(x)) =\nλ, where \nλ  ∈ {−1, 0, 1} and sign is a real-valued function that maps\nstrictly negative numbers to −1, zero to 0, and strictly positive\nnumbers to +1. \n\nArrow's view, as noted, is that only intrapersonal level\ncomparisons are meaningful, while all other kinds of comparisons are\nnot. Sen (1970b) formalized various assumptions about measurability and\ninterpersonal comparability of welfare by (i) defining an equivalence\nrelation on welfare profiles that specifies when two profiles count as\n‘containing the same information’, and (ii) requiring any\nprofiles in the same equivalence class to generate the same social\npreference ordering. Of the three kinds of comparison statements introduced above, the\nmeaningful ones are those that are invariant in each equivalence class.\nArrow's ordinalist assumption can be expressed as follows: \n\nOrdinal measurability with no interpersonal comparability\n(ONC): Two profiles <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each \ni ∈ N,\nW*i = φi(Wi),\n where\nφi is some positive monotonic\ntransformation, possibly different for different individuals. \n\nThus the individual welfare functions in any profile can be\narbitrarily monotonically transformed (‘stretched or\nsqueezed’) without informational loss, thereby ruling out any\ninterpersonal comparisons or even intrapersonal unit comparisons. \n\nIf welfare is cardinally measurable but still interpersonally\nnon-comparable, we have: \n\nCardinal measurability with no interpersonal comparability\n(CNC): Two profiles <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each i ∈ N, \nW*i = aiWi + bi, where the\nais and bis are real numbers\n(with ai > 0), possibly different for\ndifferent individuals. \n\nHere, each individual's welfare function is unique up to\npositive affine transformations (‘scaling and shifting’),\nbut there is still no common scale across individuals. This renders\nintrapersonal level and unit comparisons meaningful, but rules out interpersonal\ncomparisons and zero comparisons. \n\nInterpersonal level comparability is achieved under the following\nenriched variant of ordinal measurability: \n\nOrdinal measurability with interpersonal level comparability\n(OLC): Two profiles <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each i ∈ N, \nW*i = φ(Wi), where φ is the same\npositive monotonic transformation for all individuals. \n\nHere, a profile of individual welfare functions can be arbitrarily\nmonotonically transformed (‘stretched or squeezed’) without\ninformational loss, but the same transformation must be used for all\nindividuals, thereby rendering interpersonal level comparisons meaningful. \n\nInterpersonal unit comparability is achieved under the following\nenriched variant of cardinal measurability: \n\nCardinal measurability with interpersonal unit comparability\n(CUC): Two profiles <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each i ∈ N, \nW*i = aWi + bi, where a is\nthe same real number for all individuals (a > 0) and\nthe bis are real numbers. \n\nHere, the welfare functions in each profile can be re-scaled and\nshifted without informational loss, but the same scalar multiple\n(though not necessarily the same shifting constant) must be used for\nall individuals, thereby rendering interpersonal unit comparisons\nmeaningful. \n\nZero comparisons, finally, become meaningful under the following\nenriched variant of ordinal measurability (List 2001): \n\nOrdinal measurability with zero comparability (ONC+0): Two\nprofiles <W1, W2,\n…, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each i ∈ N, W*i =\nφi(Wi), where\nφi is some positive monotonic and\nzero-preserving transformation, possibly different for different\nindividuals. (Here zero-preserving means that\nφi(0) = 0.) \n\nThis allows arbitrary stretching and squeezing of individual welfare\nfunctions without informational loss, provided the welfare level of\nzero remains fixed, thereby ensuring zero comparability. \n\nSeveral other measurability and interpersonal comparability\nassumptions have been discussed in the literature. The following\nensures the meaningfulness of interpersonal comparisons of both levels and units: \n\nCardinal measurability with full interpersonal comparability\n(CFC): Two profiles <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each i ∈ N, \nW*i =\naWi + b, where a, b are\nthe same real numbers for all individuals (a > 0). \n\nLastly, intra- and interpersonal comparisons of all three\nkinds (level, unit, and zero) are meaningful if we accept the\nfollowing: \n\nRatio-scale measurability with full interpersonal comparability\n(RFC): Two profiles <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> contain the same information whenever,\nfor each i ∈ N, W*i =\naWi, where a is the same real number for\nall individuals (a > 0). \n\nWhich assumption is warranted depends on how welfare is interpreted.\nIf welfare is hedonic utility, which can be experienced only\nfrom a first-person perspective, interpersonal comparisons are harder\nto justify than if welfare is the objective satisfaction of\nsubjective preferences or desires (the\ndesire-satisfaction view) or an objective good or\nstate (an objective-list view) (e.g., Hausman 1995; List\n2003b). The desire-satisfaction view may render interpersonal\ncomparisons empirically meaningful (by relating the interpersonally\nsignificant maximal and minimal levels of welfare for each individual\nto the attainment of his or her most and least preferred alternatives),\nbut at the expense of running into problems of expensive tastes or\nadaptive preferences (Hausman 1995). Resource-based, functioning-based,\nor primary-goods-based currencies of welfare, by contrast, may allow\nempirically meaningful and less morally problematic interpersonal\ncomparisons.  \n\nOnce we introduce interpersonal comparisons of welfare levels or\nunits, or zero comparisons, there exist possible SWFLs satisfying the\nanalogues of Arrow's conditions as well as stronger desiderata.\nIn a welfare-aggregation context, Arrow's impossibility can\ntherefore be traced to a lack of interpersonal comparability. \n\nAs noted, a SWFL respects a given assumption about measurability and\ninterpersonal comparability if, for any two profiles\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> and <W*1,\nW*2, …, W*n> that\nare deemed to contain the same information, we have\nF(W1, W2, …,\nWn) = F(W*1,\nW*2, …, W*n).\nArrow's conditions and theorem can be restated as follows: \n\nUniversal domain: The domain of F is the set of\nall logically possible profiles of individual welfare functions. \n\nOrdering: For any profile <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> in the\ndomain of F, the social preference relation R is\ncomplete and transitive. \n\nWeak Pareto principle: For any profile\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> in the domain of F, if for all\ni∈N Wi(x) >\nWi(y), then xPy. \n\nIndependence of irrelevant alternatives: For any two\nprofiles <W1, W2,\n…, Wn> and\n<W*1, W*2, …,\nW*n> in the domain of F and any\nx, y ∈ X, if for all i\n∈ N Wi(x) =\nW*i(x) and\nWi(y) =\nW*i(y), then xRy if and only if\nxR*y. \n\nNon-dictatorship: There does not exist an individual\ni ∈ N such that, for all\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> in the domain of F and all\nx, y ∈ X,\nWi(x) >\nWi(y) implies xPy. \n\nTheorem: Under ONC (or CNC, as Sen 1970b has shown), if\n|X| > 2, there exists no SWFL satisfying universal domain,\nordering, the weak Pareto principle, independence of irrelevant\nalternatives, and non-dictatorship. \n\nCrucially, however, each of OLC, CUC, and ONC+0 is sufficient for\nthe existence of SWFLs satisfying all other conditions: \n\nTheorem (combining several results from the literature, as illustrated below): Under each of OLC, CUC, and ONC+0, there exist\nSWFLs satisfying universal domain, ordering, the weak Pareto principle,\nindependence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship (as well\nas stronger conditions). \n\nSome examples of such SWFLs come from political philosophy and\nwelfare economics. A possible SWFL under OLC is a version of\nRawls's difference principle (1971). \n\nMaximin: For any profile <W1,\nW2, …, Wn> and\nany x, y ∈ X, xRy if and only\nif mini∈N(Wi(x)) ≥\nmini∈N(Wi(y)). \n\nWhile maximin rank-orders social alternatives in terms of the\nwelfare level of the worst-off individual alone, its lexicographic\nextension (leximin), which was endorsed by Rawls himself, uses\nthe welfare level of the second-worst-off individual as a tie-breaker\nwhen there is tie at the level of the worst off, the welfare level of\nthe third-worst-off individual as a tie-breaker when there is a tie at\nthe second stage, and so on. (Note, however, that Rawls focused on\nprimary goods, rather than welfare, as the relevant\n‘currency’.) This satisfies the strong (not just\nweak) Pareto principle, requiring that if for all\ni∈N Wi(x) ≥\nWi(y), then xRy, and if in\naddition for some \ni ∈ N\nWi(x) >\nWi(y), then xPy. \n\nAn example of a possible SWFL under CUC is classical\nutilitarianism. \n\nUtilitarianism: For any profile\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> and any \nx, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if\nW1(x) + W2(x)\n+ … + Wn(x) ≥\nW1(y) + W2(y)\n+ … + Wn(y). \n\nFinally, an example of a possible SWFL under ONC+0 is a variant of a\nfrequently used, though rather simplistic poverty measure. \n\nA head-count rule: For any profile\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> and any x, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if \n|{i ∈ N : Wi(x) < 0}|\n< |{i ∈ N : Wi(y) < 0}| or\n[|{i ∈ N : Wi(x)\n< 0}| = |{i ∈ N :\nWi(y) < 0}| and\nxRjy], where j ∈ N is some\nantecedently fixed tie-breaking individual. \n\nWhile substantively less compelling than maximin or utilitarian\nrules, head-count rules require only zero-comparability of welfare\n(List 2001).  \n\nAn important conclusion, therefore, is that Rawls's difference\nprinciple, the classical utilitarian principle, and even the head-count\nmethod of poverty measurement can all be seen as solutions to\nArrow's aggregation problem that become possible once we go\nbeyond Arrow's framework of ordinal, interpersonally\nnon-comparable preferences. \n\nUnder CFC, one can provide a simultaneous characterization of\nRawlsian maximin and utilitarianism (Deschamps and Gevers 1978). It\nuses two additional axioms. One, minimal equity, requires (in\nthe words of Sen 1977: 1548) ‘that a person who is going to be\nbest off anyway does not always strictly have his way’,\nand another, separability, requires that two welfare profiles\nthat coincide for some subset M ⊆ N while\neveryone in N\\M is indifferent between all\nalternatives in X lead to the same social ordering. \n\nTheorem (Deschamps and Gevers 1978): Under CFC, any SWFL\nsatisfying universal domain, ordering, the strong Pareto principle,\nindependence of irrelevant alternatives, anonymity (as in May's\ntheorem), minimal equity, and separability is either leximin or of a\nutilitarian type (meaning that, except possibly when there are ties in\nsum-total welfare, it coincides with the utilitarian SWFL defined\nabove). \n\nFinally, the additional information available under RFC makes\n‘prioritarian’ SWFLs\n possible.[10]\nLike utilitarian SWFLs, they rank-order social\nalternatives on the basis of welfare sums across the individuals in\nN, but rather than summing up welfare directly, they sum up\nconcavely transformed welfare, giving greater marginal weight to lower\nlevels of welfare. \n\nPrioritarianism: For any profile\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> and any \nx, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if\nW1r(x) +\nW2r(x) + … +\nWnr(x) ≥\nW1r(y) +\nW2r(y) + … +\nWnr(y), where 0 <\nr < 1. \n\nPrioritarianism requires RFC and not merely CFC because, by design,\nthe prioritarian social ordering for any welfare profile is not\ninvariant under changes in welfare levels (shifting). \n\nThe present welfare-aggregation framework has been applied to several further areas. It\nhas been generalized to variable-population choice problems, so as\nto formalize population ethics in the tradition of Parfit (1984). Here,\nwe must rank-order social alternatives (e.g., possible worlds) in which\ndifferent individuals exist. Let N(x) denote the set of individuals existing under alternative x. For example, the set N(x) could differ from the set N(y), when x and y are distinct alternatives (this generalizes our previous assumption of a fixed set N). The variable-population case raises questions such as whether a world\nwith a smaller number of better-off individuals is better than, equally\ngood as, or worse than a world with a larger number of worse-off\nindividuals. (The focus here is on axiological questions about the\nrelative goodness of such worlds, not normative questions about the\nrightness or wrongness of bringing them about.) \n\nParfit (1984) and others argued that classical utilitarianism is\nsubject to the repugnant conclusion: a world with a very large\nnumber of individuals whose welfare levels are barely above zero could\nhave a larger sum-total of welfare, and therefore count as better, than\na world with a smaller number of very well-off individuals. \n\nBlackorby, Donaldson, and Bossert (e.g., 2005) have axiomatically\ncharacterized different variable-population welfare aggregation\nmethods that avoid the repugnant conclusion and satisfy some other\ndesiderata. One solution is the following: \n\nCritical-level utilitarianism: For any profile\n<W1, W2, …,\nWn> and any x, y ∈\nX, xRy if and only if\nΣi∈N(x)[Wi(x)\n− c] ≥\nΣi∈N(y)[Wi(y)\n− c], where c ≥ 0 is some ‘critical\nlevel’ of welfare above which the quality of life counts as\n‘decent/good’. \n\nCritical-level utilitarianism avoids the repugnant conclusion when\nthe parameter c is set sufficiently large. It requires\nstronger measurability of welfare than classical utilitarianism, since\nit generates a social ordering R that is not generally\ninvariant under re-scaling of welfare units or shifts in welfare\nlevels. Even the rich framework of RFC would force the critical level\nc to be zero, thereby collapsing critical-level utilitarianism\ninto classical utilitarianism and making it vulnerable to the repugnant\nconclusion again. As Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson (1999: 420)\nnote,  \n[s]ome information environments that are ethically\nadequate in fixed-population settings have ethically unattractive\nconsequences in variable-population environments. \nThus, in the\nvariable-population case, a more significant departure from the\nlimited informational framework of Arrow's original model is needed to\navoid impossibility results. \n\nThe SWFL approach has been generalized to the case in which each\nindividual has multiple welfare functions (e.g., a k-tuple of\nthem), capturing (i) multiple opinions about each individual's\nwelfare (e.g., Roberts 1995; Ooghe and Lauwers 2005) or (ii) multiple\ndimensions of welfare (e.g., List 2004a). In this case, we are faced\nnot only with issues of measurability and interpersonal comparability,\nbut also with issues of inter-opinion or inter-dimensional\ncomparability. To obtain compelling possibility results, comparability\nacross both individuals and dimensions/opinions is needed. A related\nliterature addresses multidimensional inequality measurement (for an\nintroductory review, see Weymark 2006). \n\nFinally, in the philosophy of biology, the one-dimensional and\nmulti-dimensional SWFL frameworks have been used (by Okasha 2009 and\nBossert, Qi, and Weymark 2013) to analyse the notion of group fitness,\ndefined as a function of individual fitness indicators. \n\nA more recent branch of social choice theory is the theory of\njudgment aggregation. It can be motivated by observing that votes, orderings, or welfare functions over multiple alternatives are not the only objects we may wish to aggregate from an individual to a collective level. Many decision-making bodies,\nsuch as legislatures, collegial courts, expert panels, and other\ncommittees, are faced with more complex ‘aggreganda’. In\nparticular, they may have to aggregate individual sets of judgments on\nmultiple, logically connected propositions into collective sets of\njudgments. \n\nA court may have to judge whether a defendant is liable for breach\nof contract on the basis of whether there was a valid contract in place\nand whether there was a breach. An expert panel may have to judge\nwhether atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations will exceed a\nparticular threshold by 2050, whether there is a causal chain from\ngreater greenhouse-gas concentrations to temperature increases, and\nwhether the temperature will increase. Legislators may have to judge\nwhether a particular end is socially desirable, whether a proposed\npolicy is the best means for achieving that end, and whether to pursue\nthat policy. \n\nThese problems cannot be formalized in standard\npreference-aggregation models, since the aggreganda are not orderings\nbut sets of judgments on multiple propositions. The theory of judgment\naggregation represents these aggreganda in propositional logic (or\nanother suitable logic). The field was inspired by the ‘doctrinal\nparadox’ in jurisprudence, with which we begin. \n\nKornhauser and Sager (1986) described the following problem. (A\nstructurally similar problem was discovered by Vacca 1921 and, as\nElster 2013 points out, by Poisson 1837.) A three-judge court has to\nmake judgments on the following propositions: \n\nAccording to legal doctrine, the premises p and\nq are jointly necessary and sufficient for the\nconclusion r. Suppose the individual judges hold the\nviews shown in Table 5. \n\nAlthough each individual judge respects the relevant legal doctrine,\nthere is a majority for p, a majority for q, and yet\na majority against r—in breach of legal doctrine. The\ncourt faces a dilemma: it can either go with the majority\njudgments on the premises (p and q) and reach a\n‘liable’ verdict by logical inference (the\nissue-by-issue or premise-based approach);\nor go with the majority judgment on the conclusion\n(r) and reach a ‘not liable’ verdict, ignoring the\nmajority judgments on the premises (the case-by-case or\nconclusion-based approach). Kornhauser and Sager's\n‘doctrinal paradox’ consists in the fact that these two\napproaches may lead to opposite outcomes. \n\nWe can learn another lesson from this example. Relative to the legal\ndoctrine, the majority judgments are logically inconsistent. Formally\nexpressed, the set of majority-accepted propositions, {p,\nq, not r}, is inconsistent relative to the constraint\nr if and only if (p and\nq). This observation was the starting point of the more\nrecent, formal-logic-based literature on judgment aggregation (beginning with a model and impossibility result in List and Pettit 2002). \n\nThe possibility of inconsistent majority judgments is not tied to\nthe presence of a legal doctrine or other explicit side constraint (as\npointed out by Pettit 2001, who called this phenomenon the\n‘discursive dilemma’). Suppose, for example, an expert\npanel has to make judgments on three propositions (and their\nnegations): \n\nIf individual judgments are as shown in Table 6, the majority\njudgments are inconsistent: despite individually consistent judgments,\nthe set of majority-accepted propositions, {p, if p then\nq, not q}, is logically inconsistent. \n\nThe patterns of judgments in Tables 5 and 6 are structurally\nequivalent to the pattern of preferences leading to Condorcet's\nparadox, when we reinterpret those preferences as judgments on\npropositions of the form ‘x is preferable to\ny’, ‘y is preferable to\nz’, and so on, as shown in Table 7 (List and Pettit\n2004; an earlier interpretation of preferences along these lines can be\nfound in Guilbaud [1952] 1966). Here, the set of majority-accepted\npropositions is inconsistent relative to the constraint of\ntransitivity. \n\nA general combinatorial result subsumes all these phenomena. Call a\nset of propositions minimally inconsistent if it is a\nlogically inconsistent set, but all its proper subsets are\nconsistent. \n\nProposition (Dietrich and List 2007a; Nehring and Puppe\n2007): Propositionwise majority voting may generate inconsistent\ncollective judgments if and only if the set of propositions (and their\nnegations) on which judgments are to be made has a minimally\ninconsistent subset of three or more propositions. \n\nIn the examples of Tables 6, 5, and 7, the relevant minimally\ninconsistent sets of size (at least) three are: {p, if p\nthen q, not q}, which is minimally inconsistent simpliciter; {p, q, not r},\nwhich is minimally inconsistent relative to the side constraint r\nif and only if (p and q); and {‘x is\npreferable to y’, ‘y is preferable to\nz’, ‘z is preferable to\nx’}, which is minimally inconsistent relative to a\ntransitivity constraint on preferability. \n\nThe basic model of judgment aggregation can be defined as follows\n(List and Pettit 2002). Let N = {1, 2, …, n}\nbe a set of individuals (n ≥ 2). The propositions on\nwhich judgments are to be made are represented by sentences from\npropositional logic (or some other, expressively richer logic, such as\na predicate, modal, or conditional logic; see Dietrich 2007). We define\nthe agenda, X, as a finite set of propositions,\nclosed under single\n negation.[11]\nFor example, X could be {p,\n¬p, p→q,\n¬(p→q), q, ¬q},\nas in the expert-panel case. \n\nEach individual i ∈ N has a judgment\nset Ji, defined as a subset\nJi ⊆ X and interpreted as the set\nof propositions that individual i accepts. A judgment set is\nconsistent if it is a logically consistent set\nof\n propositions[12]\nand\ncomplete (relative to X) if it contains a member of\nevery proposition-negation pair p, ¬p ∈\nX. \n\nA combination of judgment sets across the individuals,\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn>, is called a profile. A\njudgment aggregation rule, F, is a function that\nassigns to each profile <J1,\nJ2, …, Jn> (in\nsome domain of admissible profiles) a collective judgment set\nJ = F(J1, J2,\n…, Jn) ⊆ X, interpreted as\nthe set of propositions accepted by the group as a whole. As before,\nwhen F is clear from the context, we write J for the\ncollective judgment set corresponding to\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn>. Again, for generality, we build no\nrationality requirement on J (such as consistency or\ncompleteness) into the definition of a judgment aggregation rule. \n\nThe simplest example of a judgment aggregation rule is\npropositionwise majority voting. Here, for any profile\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn>, J = {p ∈\nX : |{i ∈ N : p ∈\nJi}| > n/2}. As we have seen, this\nmay produce inconsistent collective judgments. \n\nConsider the following conditions on an aggregation rule: \n\nUniversal domain: The domain of F is the set of\nall logically possible profiles of consistent and complete individual\njudgment sets. \n\nCollective rationality: For any profile\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn> in the domain of F, the\ncollective judgment set J is consistent and complete. \n\nAnonymity: For any two profiles\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn> and\n<J*1,\nJ*2, …,\nJ*n> that are permutations of\neach other, F(J1, J2,\n…, Jn) =\nF(J*1,\nJ*1, …,\nJ*n). \n\nSystematicity: For any two profiles\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn> and \n<J*1,\nJ*2, …,\nJ*n>\nin\nthe domain of F and any p, q ∈\nX, if for all i ∈ N p ∈\nJi if and only if q ∈\nJ*i, then p ∈ J\nif and only if q ∈ J*. \n\nThe first three conditions are analogous to universal domain,\nordering, and anonymity in preference aggregation. The last is the\ncounterpart of independence of irrelevant alternatives, though\nstronger: it requires that (i) the collective judgment on any\nproposition p ∈ X (of which a binary ranking\nproposition such as ‘x is preferable to\ny’ is a special case) depend only on individual\npropositions on p (the independence part), and (ii)\nthe pattern of dependence between individual and collective judgments\nbe the same across all propositions in X (the\nneutrality part). Formally, independence is the\nspecial case with quantification restricted to p = q.\nPropositionwise majority voting satisfies all these conditions, except\nthe consistency part of collective rationality. \n\nTheorem (List and Pettit 2002): If {p, q,\np∧q} ⊆ X (where p and\nq are mutually independent propositions and\n‘∧’ can also be replaced by ‘∨’\nor ‘→’), there exists no judgment aggregation rule\nsatisfying universal domain, collective rationality, anonymity, and\nsystematicity. \n\nLike other impossibility theorems, this result is best interpreted\nas describing the trade-offs between different conditions on an\naggregation rule. The result has been generalized and strengthened in\nvarious ways, beginning with Pauly and van Hees's (2006) proof\nthat the impossibility persists if anonymity is weakened to\nnon-dictatorship (for other generalizations, see Dietrich 2006 and\nMongin 2008). \n\nAs we have seen, in preference aggregation, the\n‘boundary’ between possibility and impossibility results is\neasy to draw: when there are only two decision alternatives, all of the\ndesiderata on a preference aggregation rule reviewed above can be\nsatisfied (and majority rule does the job); when there are three or\nmore alternatives, there are impossibility results. In judgment\naggregation, by contrast, the picture is more complicated. What matters\nis not the number of propositions in X but the nature of the\nlogical interconnections between them. \n\nImpossibility results in judgment aggregation have the following\ngeneric form: for a given class of agendas, the aggregation rules\nsatisfying a particular set of conditions (usually, a domain condition,\na rationality condition, and some responsiveness conditions) are\nnon-existent or degenerate (e.g., dictatorial). Different kinds of\nagendas trigger different instances of this scheme, with stronger or\nweaker conditions imposed on the aggregation rule depending on the\nproperties of those agendas (for a more detailed review, see List\n2012). The significance of combinatorial properties of the agenda was\nfirst discovered by Nehring and Puppe (2002) in a mathematically\nrelated but interpretationally distinct framework (strategy-proof\nsocial choice over so-called property spaces). Three kinds of agenda\nstand out: \n\nA non-simple agenda: X has a minimally\ninconsistent subset of three or more propositions. \n\nA pair-negatable agenda: X has a minimally\ninconsistent subset Y that can be rendered consistent by\nnegating a pair of propositions in it. (Equivalently, X is not\nisomorphic to a set of propositions whose only connectives are ¬\nand ↔; see Dokow and Holzman 2010a.) \n\nA path-connected agenda (or totally blocked, in\nNehring and Puppe 2002): For any p, q ∈\nX, there is a sequence p1,\np2, …, pk ∈\nX with p1 = p and\npk = q such that p1\nconditionally entails p2, p2\nconditionally entails p3, …, and\npk−1 conditionally entails\npk. (Here, pi conditionally\nentails pj if pi\n∪ Y entails pj for some Y\n⊆ X consistent with each of pi and\n¬pj.) \n\nSome agendas have two or more of these properties. The agendas in\nour ‘doctrinal paradox’ and ‘discursive\ndilemma’ examples are both non-simple and pair-negatable. The\npreference agenda, X = {‘x is\npreferable to y’, ‘y is preferable to\nx’, ‘x is preferable to\nz’, ‘z is preferable to\nx’, …}, is non-simple, pair-negatable, and\npath-connected (assuming preferability is transitive and complete). The\nfollowing result holds: \n\nTheorem (Dietrich and List 2007b; Dokow and Holzman 2010a;\nbuilding on Nehring and Puppe 2002): If X is non-simple,\npair-negatable, and path-connected, there exists no judgment\naggregation rule satisfying universal domain, collective rationality,\nindependence, unanimity preservation (requiring that, for any unanimous\nprofile <J, J, …, J>,\nF(J, J, …, J) = J),\nand\n non-dictatorship.[13] \n\nApplied to the preference agenda, this result yields Arrow's\ntheorem (for strict preference orderings) as a corollary (predecessors\nof this result can be found in List and Pettit 2004 and\nNehring\n 2003).[14]\nThus Arrovian\npreference aggregation can be reinterpreted as a special case of\njudgment aggregation. \n\nThe literature contains several variants of this theorem. One\nvariant drops the agenda property of path-connectedness and strengthens\nindependence to systematicity. A second variant drops the agenda\nproperty of pair-negatability and imposes a monotonicity condition on\nthe aggregation rule (requiring that additional support never hurt an\naccepted proposition) (Nehring and Puppe 2010; the latter result was\nfirst proved in the above-mentioned mathematically related framework by\nNehring and Puppe 2002). A final variant drops both path-connectedness\nand pair-negatability while imposing both systematicity and\nmonotonicity (ibid.). \n\nIn each case, the agenda properties are not only sufficient but also (if n ≥ 3) necessary for the result (Nehring and Puppe 2002, 2010; Dokow and\nHolzman 2010a). Note also that path-connectedness implies\nnon-simplicity. Therefore, non-simplicity need not be listed among the\ntheorem's conditions, though it is needed in the variants\ndropping path-connectedness. \n\nAs in preference aggregation, one way to avoid the present\nimpossibility results is to relax universal domain. If the domain of\nadmissible profiles of individual judgment sets is restricted to those\nsatisfying specific ‘cohesion’ conditions, propositionwise\nmajority voting produces consistent collective judgments. \n\nThe simplest cohesion condition is unidimensional alignment\n(List 2003c). A profile <J1,\nJ2, …, Jn> is\nunidimensionally aligned if the individuals in N can\nbe ordered from left to right (e.g., on some cognitive or ideological\ndimension) such that, for every proposition p ∈\nX, the individuals accepting p (i.e., those with\np ∈ Ji) are either all to the left,\nor all to the right, of those rejecting p (i.e., those with\np ∉ Ji), as illustrated in Table 8.\nFor any such profile, the majority judgments are consistent: the\njudgment set of the median individual relative to the left-right\nordering will prevail (where n is odd). This judgment set will\ninherit its consistency from the median individual, assuming individual\njudgments are consistent. By implication, on unidimensionally aligned\ndomains, propositionwise majority voting will satisfy the rest of the\nconditions on judgment aggregation rules reviewed above. \n\nIn analogy with the case of single-peakedness in preference\naggregation, several less restrictive conditions already suffice for\nconsistent majority judgments. One such condition (introduced in\nDietrich and List 2010a, where a survey is provided) generalizes\nSen's triple-wise value-restriction. A profile\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn> is value-restricted if every\nminimally inconsistent subset Y ⊆ X has a pair\nof elements p, q such that no individual i\n∈ N has {p, q} ⊆\nJi. Value-restriction prevents any minimally\ninconsistent subset of X from becoming majority-accepted, and\nhence ensures consistent majority judgments. Applied to the preference\nagenda, value-restriction reduces to Sen's equally named\ncondition. \n\nWhile the requirement that collective judgments be consistent is\nwidely accepted, the requirement that collective judgments be complete\n(in X) is more contentious. In support of completeness, one\nmight say that a given proposition would not be included in X\nunless it is supposed to be collectively adjudicated. Against\ncompleteness, one might say that there are circumstances in which the\nlevel of disagreement on a particular proposition (or set of\npropositions) is so great that forming a collective view on it is\nundesirable or counterproductive. Several papers offer possibility or\nimpossibility results on completeness relaxations (e.g., List and\nPettit 2002; Gärdenfors 2006; Dietrich and List 2007a, 2008; Dokow\nand Holzman 2010b). \n\nJudgment aggregation rules violating collective completeness while\nsatisfying (all or most of) the other conditions introduced above\ninclude: unanimity rule, where, for any profile\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn>, J = {p ∈\nX : p ∈ Ji for all\ni ∈ N}; supermajority rules, where,\nfor any profile <J1, J2,\n…, Jn>, J = {p\n∈ X : |{i ∈ N : p\n∈ Ji}| > qn} for a suitable\nacceptance quota q ∈ (0.5,1); and conclusion-based\nrules, where a subset Y ⊆ X of logically\nindependent propositions (and their negations) is designated as a set\nof conclusions and J = {p ∈ Y : |{i ∈ N : p ∈\nJi}| > n/2}. In the multi-member\ncourt example of Table 5, the set of conclusions is simply Y =\n{r, ¬r}. \n\nGiven consistent individual judgment sets, unanimity rule guarantees\nconsistent collective judgment sets, because the intersection of\nseveral consistent sets of propositions is always consistent.\nSupermajority rules guarantee consistent collective judgment sets too,\nprovided the quota q is chosen to be at least\n(k−1)/k, where k is the size of the largest\nminimally inconsistent subset of X. The reason is\ncombinatorial: any k distinct supermajorities of the relevant\nsize will always have at least one individual in common. So, for any\nminimally inconsistent set of propositions (which is at most of size\nk) to be majority-accepted, at least one individual would have\nto accept all the propositions in the set, contradicting this\nindividual's consistency (Dietrich and List 2007a; List and\nPettit 2002). Conclusion-based rules, finally, produce consistent\ncollective judgment sets by construction, but always leave\nnon-conclusions undecided. \n\nGärdenfors (2006) and more generally Dietrich and List (2008)\nand Dokow and Holzman (2010b) have shown that if—while relaxing\ncompleteness—we require collective judgment sets to be\ndeductively closed (i.e., for any p ∈\nX entailed by J, it must be that p ∈\nJ), we face an impossibility result again. For the same\nagendas that lead to the impossibility result reviewed in \nSection 5.4,\nthere exists no judgment aggregation rule satisfying universal domain,\ncollective consistency and deductive closure, independence, unanimity\npreservation, and non-oligarchy. An aggregation rule is called\noligarchic if there is an antecedently fixed subset M\n⊆ N (the ‘oligarchs’) such that, for any\nprofile <J1, J2,\n…, Jn>, J = {p\n∈ X : p ∈ Ji for all\ni ∈ M}. Unanimity rule and dictatorships are\nspecial cases with M = N and M =\n{i} for some i ∈ N, respectively. \n\nThe downside of oligarchic aggregation rules is that they either\nlapse into dictatorship or lead to stalemate, with the slightest\ndisagreements between oligarchs resulting in indecision (since every\noligarch has veto power on every proposition). \n\nA variety of judgment aggregation rules become possible when we\nrelax systematicity/independence. Recall that systematicity combines an\nindependence and a neutrality requirement. Relaxing only neutrality\ndoes not get us very far, since for many agendas there are\nimpossibility results with independence alone, as illustrated in\nSection 5.4. \n\nOne much-discussed class of aggregation rules violating independence\nis given by the premise-based rules. Here, a subset Y\n⊆ X of logically independent propositions (and their\nnegations) is designated as a set of premises, as in the court\nexample. For any profile <J1,\nJ2, …, Jn>,\nJ = {p ∈ X : JY\nentails p} where JY are the\nmajority-accepted propositions among the premises, formally {p\n∈ Y : |{i ∈ N : p\n∈ Ji}| > n/2}. Informally,\nmajority votes are taken on the premises, and the collective judgments\non all other propositions are determined by logical implication. If the\npremises constitute a logical basis for the entire agenda, a\npremise-based rule guarantees consistent and (absent ties) complete\ncollective judgment sets. (The present definition follows List and\nPettit 2002; for generalizations, see Dietrich and Mongin 2010. The\nprocedural and epistemic properties of premise-based rules are\ndiscussed in Pettit 2001; Chapman 2002; Bovens and Rabinowicz 2006;\nDietrich 2006; List 2006.) \n\nA generalization is given by the sequential priority rules\n(List 2004b; Dietrich and List 2007a). Here, for each profile\n<J1, J2, …,\nJn>, the propositions in X are\ncollectively adjudicated in a fixed order of priority, for instance, a\ntemporal or epistemic one. The collective judgment on each proposition\np ∈ X is made as follows. If the majority\njudgment on p is consistent with collective judgments on prior\npropositions, this majority judgment prevails; otherwise the collective\njudgment on p is determined by the implications of prior\njudgments. By construction, this guarantees consistent and (absent\nties) complete collective judgments. However, it is\npath-dependent: the order in which propositions are considered\nmay affect the outcome, specifically when the underlying majority\njudgments are inconsistent. For example, when this aggregation rule is\napplied to the profiles in Tables 5, 6, and 7 (but not 8), the\ncollective judgments depend on the order in which the propositions are\nconsidered. Thus sequential priority rules are vulnerable to agenda\nmanipulation. Similar phenomena occur in sequential pairwise\nmajority voting in preference aggregation (e.g., Riker 1982). \n\nAnother prominent class of aggregation rules violating independence\nis given by the distance-based rules (Pigozzi 2006, building\non Konieczny and Pino Pérez 2002; see also Miller and Osherson\n2009). A distance-based rule is defined in terms of some distance\nmetric between judgment sets, for example the Hamming\ndistance, where, for any two judgment sets J,\nJ′ ⊆ X, d(J,\nJ′) = |{p ∈ X : not [p\n∈ J ⇔ p ∈ J′]}|.\nEach profile <J1, J2,\n…, Jn> is mapped to a consistent and\ncomplete judgment set J that minimizes the sum-total distance\nfrom each of the Jis. Distance-based rules can be\ninterpreted as capturing the idea of identifying compromise judgments.\nUnlike premise-based or sequential priority rules, they do not require\na distinction between premises and conclusions or any other order of\npriority among the propositions. \n\nAs in preference aggregation, the cost of relaxing independence is\nthe loss of strategy-proofness. The conjunction of independence and\nmonotonicity is necessary and sufficient for the non-manipulability of\na judgment aggregation rule by strategic voting (Dietrich and List\n2007c; for related results, see Nehring and Puppe 2002). Thus we cannot\ngenerally achieve strategy-proofness without relaxing either universal\ndomain, or collective rationality, or unanimity preservation, or\nnon-dictatorship. In practice, we must therefore look for ways of\nrendering opportunities for strategic manipulation less of a\nthreat. \n\nAs should be evident, social choice theory is a vast field. Areas\nnot covered in this entry, or mentioned only in passing, include:\ntheories of fair division (how to divide one or several divisible or\nindivisible goods, such as cakes or houses, between several claimants;\ne.g., Brams and Taylor 1996 and Moulin 2004); behavioural social choice\ntheory (analyzing empirical evidence of voting behaviour under various\naggregation rules; e.g., Regenwetter et al. 2006; List, Luskin,\nFishkin, and McLean 2013); empirical social choice theory (analysing\nsurveys and experiments on people's intuitions about distributive\njustice; e.g., Gaertner and Schokkaert 2012); computational social\nchoice theory (analysing computational properties of aggregation rules,\nincluding their computational complexity; e.g., Bartholdi, Tovey, and\nTrick 1989; Brandt, Conitzer, and Endriss 2013); theories of\nprobability aggregation (studying the aggregation of probability or\ncredence functions; e.g., Lehrer and Wagner 1981; McConway 1981; Genest\nand Zidek 1986; Mongin 1995; Dietrich and List 2007d); theories of\ngeneral attitude aggregation (generalizing two-valued judgment\naggregation, probability/credence aggregation, and preference\naggregation; e.g., Dietrich and List 2010b; Dokow and Holzman 2010c);\nthe study of collective decision-making in non-human animals (studying\ngroup decisions in a variety of animal species from social insects to\nprimates, as surveyed in Conradt and List 2009 and the special issue it\nintroduces); and applications to social epistemology (the analysis of\ngroup doxastic states and their relationship to individual doxastic\nstates; e.g., Goldman 2004, 2010).","contact.mail":"c.list@lse.ac.uk","contact.domain":"lse.ac.uk"}]
