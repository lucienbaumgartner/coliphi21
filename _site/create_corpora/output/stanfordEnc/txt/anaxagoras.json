(born ca.\n500–480), was the first of the Presocratic philosophers to live in\nAthens. He propounded a physical theory of\n“everything-in-everything,” and claimed that\nnous (intellect or mind) was the motive cause of the\ncosmos. He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses,\nand was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories,\nincluding the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the\nmoon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones. Anaxagoras\nmaintained that the original state of the cosmos was a mixture of all\nits ingredients (the basic realities of his system). The ingredients\nare thoroughly mixed, so that no individual ingredient as such is\nevident, but the mixture is not entirely uniform or\nhomogeneous. Although every ingredient is ubiquitous, some ingredients\nare present in higher concentrations than others, and these\nproportions may also vary from place to place (even if they do not do\nso in the original state of the cosmos). The mixture is unlimited in\nextent, and at some point in time it is set into motion by the action\nof nous (intellect).  The mixture begins to rotate around some\nsmall point within it, and as the whirling motion proceeds and expands\nthrough the mass, the ingredients in the mixture are shifted and separated\nout (in terms of relative density) and remixed with each other,\nultimately producing the cosmos of apparently separate material masses and\nmaterial objects, with the different properties, that we perceive.\n\n\n\nAnaxagoras, son of Hegesibulus (or Eubulus), was a native of\nClazomenae, on the west coast of what is now Turkey. According to\nDiogenes Laertius (see the article on Doxography of Ancient\nPhilosophy) (Diels-Kranz [DK] 59 A1), Anaxagoras came from an\naristocratic and landed family, but abandoned his inheritance to study\nphilosophy. (We do not know how he acquired his philosophical\nlearning). He came to Athens (perhaps about the middle of the\n5th century, perhaps earlier), and was a friend and\nprotégé of Pericles, the Athenian general and political\nleader. There is controversy about his time in Athens; Diogenes\nLaertius says that he came to Athens to study philosophy as a young\nman. Some scholars claim that his arrival was as early as the Persian\ninvasion of 480 (O’Brien 1968, Woodbury 1981, Graham 2006), others\nargue for a later date of about 456 (Mansfeld 1979, see also Mansfeld\n2011 on Aristotle’s evidence; there is a good discussion of the\nproblems about dating Anaxagoras’ life in Sider 2005). It is clear\nfrom their dramas that his work was known to Sophocles, Euripides, and\nperhaps Aeschylus (Seneca suggests in his Natural Questions\n4a.2.17 that they shared Anaxagoras’ view about the source of the\nNile); it was certainly familiar to the comic playwright Aristophanes\n(Curd 2007, Sider 2005; see Mansfeld 1979). He was a resident in the\ncity for at least twenty years; he was said to have been charged with\nimpiety (and perhaps with Medism, political sympathy with the\nPersians), and banished from the city (437/6?). The charges against\nAnaxagoras may have been as much political as religious, because of\nhis close association with Pericles. He retreated to Lampsacus (in the\neastern Hellespont) where he died; ancient reports say that he was\nmuch honored there before and after his death. Democritus, a younger\ncontemporary, dated his own life in relation to Anaxagoras’, saying\nthat he was young in the old age of Anaxagoras (DK59A5); he reportedly\naccused Anaxagoras of plagiarism. Although Anaxagoras lived in Athens\nwhen Socrates was a youth and young adult, there are no reports that\nAnaxagoras and Socrates ever met. In Plato’s Phaedo, Socrates\nsays that he heard someone reading from Anaxagoras’ book (probably\nArchelaus, who was, according to Diogenes Laertius, pupil of\nAnaxagoras and teacher of Socrates).  Anaxagoras is included in the\nancient lists of those who wrote only one book: in\nthe Apology, Socrates reports that it could be bought for a\ndrachma. \n\nAs with all the Presocratics, Anaxagoras’ work survives only in\nfragments quoted by later philosophers and commentators; we also have\ntestimonia about his views in many ancient sources. The standard\ncollection of Presocratic texts (both fragments and testimonia) is\nH. Diels and W. Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, in\nwhich Anaxagoras is given the identifying number 59. The Greek text\nand translations can also be found in Gemelli-Marciano, 2007–2010; Graham, 2010; and Laks and Most, 2016a and 2016b.  (For discussion\nof the sources for the Presocratics, and problems associated with\nthem, see the article on Presocratic Philosophy.) Any\ndiscussion of Anaxagoras’ views must be a reconstruction that goes\nbeyond the few details that we have in the verbatim quotations, though\ninformed by the evidence of the fragments and testimonia. It should be\nkept in mind in reading the following account that scholars disagree and that other\ninterpretations are possible. \n\nAccording to Simplicius, a 6th century C.E. neo-Platonist\ncommentator on Aristotle, and our main source for the fragments,\nAnaxagoras began his book by describing an original state of complete\n(but not entirely uniform) mixture of all the ingredients of the\ncosmos; that mixture is then set in motion by the action of\nMind/Intellect (nous). The ingredients are eternal and always remain in a\nmixture of all with all, yet the rotary motion produces shifts in the\nproportions of the ingredients in a given region. The expanding\nrotation of the original mixture ultimately produces the continuing development\nof the world as we now perceive it. The foundations of his theory,\ndescriptions of this development, and a discussion of nous\nform the bulk of what remains to us of Anaxagoras’ book. The\ntestimonia suggest that the book also included detailed accounts of\nastronomical, meteorological, and geological phenomena as well as more\ndetailed discussions of perception and knowledge, now missing from our\ncollection of fragments, and known only by later reports and criticisms. \n\nAnaxagoras was influenced by two strains in early Greek\nthought. First, there is the tradition of inquiry into nature founded\nby the Milesians, and carried on by Xenophanes (Mourelatos 2008b) and\nby Heraclitus (Graham 2008).  The early Milesian\nscientist-philosophers (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes) sought to\nexplain the cosmos and all its phenomena, by appealing to regularities\nwithin the cosmic system itself, without reference to extra-natural\ncauses or to the personified gods associated with aspects of nature by\ntraditional Greek religion (Graham 2006, Gregory 2007 and 2013). They\nbased their explanations on the observed regular behavior of the\nmaterials that make up the cosmos (see White 2008 on the role of\nobservation and measurement in early Presocratic theories). \n\nSecond, there is the influence of Eleatic arguments, due to\nParmenides, concerning the metaphysical requirements for a basic\nexplanatory entity within this Milesian framework, and the\nmetaphysically proper way to go about inquiry (Curd, 2004, 2007; Sisko\n2003; for different views, see Palmer 2009, Sisko 2013).  Parmenides\ncan be seen as arguing that any acceptable cosmological account must\nbe rational, i.e., in conformity with the canons for proper inquiry,\nand must begin with metaphysically acceptable entities that are wholly\nand completely what they are; are not subject to generation,\ndestruction, or alteration; and are wholly knowable i.e., graspable by\nthought and understanding (Parmenides B2, B3, B7, B8; see Mourelatos\n2008a). Anaxagoras bases his account of the natural world on three\nprinciples of metaphysics, all of which can be seen as grounded in\nthese Eleatic requirements: No Becoming or Passing-Away, Everything is\nin Everything, and No Smallest or Largest. \n\nA fundamental tenet of Eleatic theory is that what-is-not cannot be\n(Parmenides DK 28 B2). Parmenides, using this claim (see DK 28\nB8.15–16), argued that coming-to-be and passing-away are therefore\nruled out, because genuine coming-to-be is change from what-is-not to\nwhat-is, while destruction is change from what-is to what-is-not.\nThus, says Parmenides, what-is “is without start or stop, since\ncoming to be and passing away have wandered very far away, and true\ntrust drove them out”\n (DK 28 B8.27–28).[1] \n Anaxagoras accepts this principle, explaining apparent generation and\ndestruction by replacing them with mixture and separation (or\ndissociation) of ingredients: \n\nWhat seems to us, through perception, to be generation of new entities or\ndestruction of old ones is not that at all. Rather, objects that\nappear to us to be born, to grow, and to die, are merely arrangements\nand re-arrangements of more metaphysically basic ingredients. The\nmechanism for the apparent coming-to-be is mixing and separating out\nfrom the mixture produced by the vortex motion of the ingredients. Through that mechanism, the real things, the ingredients,\ncan retain their character throughout. When an arrangement breaks\napart (or “passes away”) the ingredients are dissociated\nfrom one another (through separation) and can be re-mixed to form (or\n“become”) different arrangements, i.e., other perceptible\nobjects. \n\nOne way to think of Anaxagoras’ point in B17 is that animals,\nplants, human beings, the heavenly bodies, and so on, are natural\nconstructs. They are constructs because they depend\nfor their existence and character on the ingredients of which they are\nconstructed (and the pattern or structure that they acquire in the\nprocess). Yet they are natural because their\nconstruction occurs as one of the processes of nature. Unlike\nhuman-made artifacts (which are similarly constructs of\ningredients), they are not teleologically determined to fulfill some\npurpose. This gives Anaxagoras a two-level metaphysics. Things\nsuch as earth, water, fire, hot, bitter, dark, bone, flesh, stone, or\nwood are metaphysically basic and genuinely real (in the required\nEleatic sense): they are things-that-are. The objects constituted\nby these ingredients are not genuinely real, they are temporary\nmixtures with no autonomous metaphysical status: they are not\nthings-that-are. (The natures of the ingredients, and the\nquestion of what is included as an ingredient, are addressed below; see\n3.2 “Ingredients and Seeds”). This view, that the\ningredients are more real than the objects that they make up, is common\nin Presocratic philosophy, especially in the theories of those thinkers\nwho were influenced by Parmenides’ arguments against the\npossibility of what-is-not and so against genuine coming-to-be and\npassing-away. It can be found in Empedocles, and in the\npre-Platonic atomists, as well as, perhaps, in Plato’s middle\nperiod Theory of Forms (Denyer, 1983, Frede 1985, W.-R. Mann 2000, Silverman\n2002). \n\n“All things were together.” B1 (in part) \n\n“In everything there is a share of everything.” B11 (in\npart) \n\nAs we have seen, Anaxagoras’ commitment to Eleatic principles rules\nout the possibility of genuine coming-to-be or passing-away. It also\nrules out real qualitative changes and transformations. When a warm\nliquid cools (it seems) the hot liquid becomes cold; when a child\ningests food (milk and bread, for instance), the milk and bread are\n(it seems) transformed into flesh, blood, and bone. Yet Anaxagoras\nobjects to these claims because they entail that the hot ceases to be,\nand the cold comes to be, in the liquid, and that the bread and milk\nare destroyed while flesh, blood, and bone come to be. His solution is\nto claim not only that “all things were together” in the\noriginal mixture, but that everything is in everything at all\ntimes. If there is already blood and bone in the milk and bread, then\nthe growth of the child can be attributed to the accumulation of these\ningredients from the bread and milk, and their assimilation into the\nsubstance of the child’s body, rather than to the transformation of\nbread and milk into something else. Further, if there are both hot and\ncold in the liquid, there is no disappearance into nothing of the hot\nas the liquid cools, and no generation of the cold from what is not\n(or even from what is not cold). The clearest statement of this is in\nAnaxagoras B10, a quotation found in the following passage: \n\nAlthough interpreters both ancient (including this scholiast and\nSimplicius) and modern (Guthrie 1965 is a good example) have seen\nthe desire to explain nutrition and growth as the primary\nmotivation for adopting the Everything-in-Everything principle, it is more\nlikely that Anaxagoras’ adoption of the general metaphysical\nprinciple of No-Becoming leads him to claim that everything is in\neverything (Schofield 1981, Curd 2007). Nutrition and growth are simply particularly clear instances of the changes\nthat are ruled out as fundamentally real if there is no becoming. \n\nThe Everything-in-Everything principle asserts the omnipresence of\ningredients. In everything there is a mixture of all the ingredients\nthat there are: every ingredient is everywhere at all times. This\nprinciple is a fundamental tenet of Anaxagoras’ theory, and leads to\ndifficulties of interpretation (see, for instance, the debate between\nMathews 2002 and 2005 and Sisko 2005). If everything is in everything,\nthere must be interpenetration of ingredients, for it must be possible\nfor there to be many ingredients in the same space.  Indeed, the\nprinciple requires that all ingredients be in every space at all times\n(the No Smallest or Largest principle also plays a role here: see\nsect. 2.3). This will allow any ingredient to emerge from a mixture\nthrough accumulation (or, having been unmixed, to become submerged in\none) at any point at any time, and thus allow for the appearance of\ncoming-to-be (or passing-away) of things or qualities. \n\nSome scholars have supposed that Anaxagoras thought of these\ningredients as very small particles (Vlastos 1950, Guthrie 1965, Sider\n2005, Lewis 2000). But a particle would have to be a smallest\namount of some type of ingredient, occupying some space all by\nitself—with no other type of ingredient in it. Not only\ndoes the No Smallest or Largest principle rule this out (see sect.\n2.3), but the particulate interpretation seems inconsistent with the\nEverything-in-Everything principle. It is crucial to\nAnaxagoras’ theory that there be (in actuality) no such pure bits\nor volumes of any type of ingredient. \n\nInstead one might conceive of the ingredients as fluid, like pastes or\nliquids which can be smeared together, with different areas of the\nmixture characterized by different relative densities of the\ningredients, all of which are nevertheless everywhere in it. Each\ngenuinely real ingredient could be mixed with every other, and so\nwould be contained in any area of the mixture, and in principle\nvisibly recoverable from it by accumulation or increased\nconcentration.  The differing densities of the ingredients would allow\nfor differences in the phenomenal character of the mixture. To an\nobserver, different areas would appear hotter or colder, sweeter or\nmore bitter, more red than green, and so on, and rightly so. As the\nrelative concentration of ingredients in any area of the mixture\naltered (through the mixture and separation brought about by the\nrotation of the original blend of ingredients), the phenomenal\ncharacter of that region of the mixture would alter. An\nintriguing account (Marmodoro 2015, 2017) suggests that Anaxagorean\ningredients are not material; rather they are primitive physical\nqualitative powers or dispositions (in the parlance of contemporary\nmetaphysics, they are “gunky”).  \n\nB1’s claim that “all things were together” before the\noriginal rotation occurred does not guarantee the truth of the\nEverything-in-Everything principle. If separation occurs within an\noriginal mixture of everything with everything, as a result of the\nmotion imparted by nous, then it could be that, given enough\ntime, ingredients would be segregated from one another (as they are in\nEmpedocles during the triumph of Strife, when the four roots are\ncompletely separated). Anaxagoras needs to block this, so that he can\nmaintain his commitment to the No Becoming principle. In some region\nthat came by separation to contain, say, nothing but bone, there would\ncome to be pure bone (as a new entity), in replacement for and\ndestruction of the mixture that was previously there. He blocks this\npossibility by claiming that there is no smallest (and no largest). If\nthere is no lower limit on the density of an ingredient, then no\ningredient will be completely removed from any region of the mixture\nthrough the force of the rotary motion caused by\nnous. Here are Anaxagoras’ claims: \n\nNor of the small is there a smallest, but always a smaller (for\nwhat-is cannot not be) — but also of the large there is always a\nlarger. And [the large] is equal to the small in extent\n(plêthos), but in relation to itself each thing is both\nlarge and small.\n (B3[3]) \n\nSince the shares of the large and the small are equal in number, in\nthis way too, all things will be in everything; nor is it possible that\n[anything] be separate, but all things have a share of\neverything. Since it is not possible that there is a least, it\nwould not be possible that [anything] be separated, nor come to be by\nitself, but just as in the beginning, now too all things are together.\n(B6 [in part]) \n\nThe passage from B6 makes clear that the “no smallest”\nprinciple is connected to the principle of Everything-in-Everything,\nand B3 asserts that the “no smallest” claim depends on the\nimpossibility of what-is-not. Here is one way to interpret what\nAnaxagoras is saying: if there were a smallest (particle, density,\namount) of any ingredient (call it S), we could in principle\nthrough separation reduce the amount of S in some area of the\nmixture to that smallest, and then induce further separation through\nrotation, which would remove that ingredient from a particular area of\nthe mixture. That would leave some area without “everything\nin everything.” The area would cease to be S to\nany degree and so would be not-S. In that area, the\nexplanation of coming-to-be in terms of emergence from a previous\nmixture would fail. Note that Anaxagoras — like other Greek\nthinkers, including Plato — assumes that anything that is\nmust be something or other and so slides easily between “what is\nnot f” and “what is not” (Furley\n2002). \n\nAnaxagoras’ solution is to deny that there is any lower limit\non smallness. Adopting the model of density described above, he\ncan say that there is no lowest degree of density in the mixture.\nThis emphasis on density makes it clear that Anaxagoras’\ntechnical sense of smallness is not one of particle size but of degree\nof submergence or emergence in the mixture. For an ingredient to\nbe small is for there to be a comparatively low density of that\ningredient in a particular area of the mixture in comparison with all\nthe other ingredients (everything else) in that area. The\ncorresponding assertion that there is no upper limit on largeness can\nthen be interpreted as the claim that no matter how emergent from the\nmixture (standing out from the background mixture) an ingredient is, it\ncan become still more emergent. So, no matter how sweet some water\ntastes, there is still some salt in it. The salt in the sample is\nsmall, i.e., submerged in the mixture of water and other ingredients,\nbut there will never cease to be salt in the sample.\nCorrespondingly, no matter how salty another sample is, it can always\nbecome more salty and even “turn to salt” because there is\nno upper limit to the degree of emergence from the background. As\nthe salt emerges, other ingredients will submerge, but will never\ndisappear, so that the wet itself is deeply submerged in the mix, and\nwe are left with an apparently solid block of salt (though that salt\nwill itself contain all other ingredients, with most of them in such\nsmall concentrations that they are completely submerged and not\napparent to an observer). This account of large and small is\nimplied in Schofield 1980, and worked out more fully in Inwood 1986 and\nFurth 1991; it is accepted in Curd 2007; see also Marmodoro 2017. \n\nThe Eleatic metaphysics that Anaxagoras accepts shapes the science\nthat he proposes. Anaxagoras offers an ambitious scientific theory that\nattempts to explain the workings of the cosmos, even while accepting\nthe Eleatic ban on coming-to-be and passing-away. His goal is\nscientific knowledge, i.e., understanding, as far as that is possible for human\nbeings. \n\nThe original state of the cosmos was an unlimited (apeiron)\nmixture of all the ingredients. The mixture of ingredients, all\nwith all, exists eternally. Up to some point in the past, it was\nmotionless (59 B1, A45), and it was everywhere undifferentiated, or\nalmost so. According to B1, which Simplicius, the source for the\nfragment, says was near the beginning of Anaxagoras’ book: \n\nThis undifferentiated mass includes all there is of all the natural\ningredients that there are, the ingredients that will eventually form\nthe natural constructs that constitute the cosmos as we know it.\nNothing is ever added to or subtracted from this storehouse of stuffs,\nalthough the mass of stuffs is not always homogeneous. In fact,\nthere are different densities of ingredients even at this earliest\n(pre-motion) stage. B1 makes clear that air (dark, moist stuff)\nand aether (bright fiery stuff) are the most emergent (largest)\ningredients, and their dominance means that the original mixture must\nhave been like a dense bright cloud: nothing else would be evident or\nmanifest, even had there been an observer. At some point\nnous (the time being right) set the mixture in motion and\ncaused it to begin to revolve (first in a small area, and then in an\never-widening area). The rotary motion causes the ingredients in\nthe mass to shift. This shifting produces what Anaxagoras calls\n“separating off.” Because the mass is a plenum, any\nseparation will be a rearrangement (thus a mixing) of\ningredients. The continouous ever-expanding rotation produces more and\nmore separation. The Everything-in-Everything principle continues\nto hold, so there are all ingredients at all places at all times, but\nthe different densities of ingredients allow for local variations, and\nso the rotating mass becomes qualitatively differentiated. \n\nNowhere in the extant fragments does Anaxagoras give a complete list\nof the ingredients in the mixture, or a clear indication of their\nscope, so it is up to commentators to figure out what he meant, given\nthe available evidence. There are three alternatives.  First, some\nscholars have held that Anaxagoras limited the basic ingredients to\nthe opposites, such as hot and cold, wet and dry, sweet and bitter,\ndark and light, and so on. It is the opposites that have explanatory\nforce in the theory, and all other things and properties are reducible\nto the opposites. Supporters of this view include Tannery 1886, Burnet\n1930, Cornford 1930, Vlastos 1950, Schofield 1980 (with reservations),\nInwood 1986, Spanu 1987–88, Sedley 2007, and Marmodoro 2015, 2017. On\nthis view all the material stuffs and all the objects in the universe\nwould be natural constructs. At the opposite extreme, a second option\naccepts that literally everything in the natural world is in the\noriginal mixture — opposites, but also natural materials (fire,\nearth, copper, iron, and the like), animals and plants (and their\nparts such as flesh, blood, and bone), and so on. This view makes no\ndistinction between ingredients and what have been called natural\nconstructs above. It can be found in Strang 1963, Stokes 1965, Guthrie\n1965, Barnes 1982, Furth 1991, Graham 1994 and 2004, Lewis\n2000. Finally, there is a middle view, which rejects the\nopposites-only account, and accepts that some things (plants and\nanimals, heavenly bodies) are natural constructs. The original mix\nincludes opposites, but also natural substances like metals and earth,\nand the ingredients of animals, such as flesh, blood, and bone, but no\nwhole physical objects such as plants and animals themselves, or their\norganic parts such as legs and hearts (Curd 2007; this view is\nsuggested in Schofield 1980, 132 ff.). \n\nThe “opposites only” view cannot stand (arguments\nagainst it are given in Guthrie 1965 and Graham 2004). B15 may provide\nsome evidence for the view: \n\nBut Anaxagoras’ own lists include more than the opposites (see B4a and\nB4b). Further, the Principle of Predominance (in B12, see sect. 3.4)\nwould seem to require more than opposites, since it does not seem to\nsay that each thing is reducible to opposite characteristics that\npredominate, but that each thing gets its character from the\nparticular material ingredients that predominate in it. Further\nevidence against the opposites-only view is found in Aristotle.\nAristotle claims that for Anaxagoras, the elements (the basic\nrealities) are what Aristotle calls the homoiomerous parts (On\nComing to Be and Passing Away I.1 314a18). These are (for\nAristotle) things that are literally “like-parted,” i.e.,\nthey are homogeneous all the way through, like a piece of pure gold,\nrather than being different in their different parts (like a hand),\nand Aristotle lists flesh, blood, bone, and adds “and the others\nof which the part is called by the same name [as the whole].”\nThe term homoiomeries is Aristotelian, and has no role to\nplay in Anaxagoras (Graham 1994, Curd 2007; contra: Sisko\n2009), but it is clear that for Aristotle, the ingredients in an\nAnaxagorean mixture are not just the opposites. \n\nIf the attempt to reduce the Anaxagorean ingredients to opposites is\nunsuccessful, so, too, is the interpretation that allows as an\ningredient every kind of thing in the phenomenal world. A minor\npoint is that Anaxagoras surely does not think that artifacts made by\nhuman beings are part of the mixture, and there are other semi-natural\nartifacts as well that would not seem to be present: cheese, bronze,\nwhiskey, for example. More importantly, the wide-scope view fails\nto take seriously B17’s replacement of coming-to-be and\npassing-away with mixture and dissolution. Further, it is unclear\nhow the view can discriminate between an individual and its parts or\ningredients. Are there homunculi of individuals in the original\nmix? (Lewis 2000 accepts this.) If so, how can the theory\nexplain that the growth of an organism is not simply its enlargement\n(by adding ingredients) but also its development? (A\nplant’s leaves may grow larger, but its seed pods develop, and\nare not just an enlargement of a structure that was already present in\nthe seedling plant.) In B4a Anaxagoras refers to the animals and\nhumans “that have been compounded, as many as have soul,”\nand this suggests that B17’s implicit model of living things as\nnatural constructs mixed together from the ingredients that are\ngenuinely real must be taken seriously. \n\nIt seems, then, best to interpret Anaxagoras as claiming that all\nthe material ingredients of natural living things and the heavenly\nbodies are present in the original mix, but that these objects\nthemselves are not among the ingredients but are natural constructions,\nproduced by the processes of mixture and separation that we call\nnutrition and growth, or by the rotations of the heavens and the\nattendant clumping together and breaking apart of the ingredients of\nthe stars, clouds, comets, planets, and so on. \n\nA problem for any account of the original mixture is Anaxagoras’\nmention of seeds. The word for seeds (spermata) occurs twice\nin the fragments, in lists of ingredients (in B4a and in B4b), but\nAnaxagoras nowhere explains or makes it clear what it means. There are\na number of options: seeds have been taken to be the smallest possible\nbits of ingredients (but, as argued above, there are no smallest bits\nin Anaxagoras’ system), or to be extremely small homunculi-like\ningredients that some interpretations take to be origins for\nAnaxagoras of living things which then expand by the addition of other\ningredients (Lewis 2000). Furley 1976 and 2002 advocates the simplest\ninterpretation, that Anaxagoras simply means biological seeds (but not\nhomunculi), and this seems the best proposal (see also Barnes 1982,\nCurd 2007, Sedley 2007, Marmodoro 2015, 2017, 147–153; Marmodoro also sees seeds as biological, containing pre-existing structures). A seed would then be a biological origin\npoint, and might perhaps be the route through which nous\n(which controls all things that have soul, i.e., anything alive)\nenters a living thing. If a seed is mixed with the right ingredients\nin the right circumstances, a living thing will grow. \n\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Anaxagoras acquired the nickname Mr.\nMind (DK 59 A1); his view that the cosmos is controlled by\nnous, mind or intelligence, first attracted and then\ndisappointed Socrates (Plato, Phaedo 97b8ff.). Plato and\nAristotle applauded Anaxagoras for using nous as the\nfirst principle of motion, but both criticized him for failing to be\nconsistent in that use, arguing that once he invoked Mind to set the\noriginal mixture in motion, Anaxagoras reduced later causes to\nmindless mechanism. \n\nAnaxagoras is adamant that nous is completely different\nfrom the ingredients that constituted the original mixture. It is the\nonly thing to which the Everything-in-Everything principle does not\napply. Mind is present to some things, but it is not an ingredient or share as\nflesh and blood are ingredients in a dog (B11: “In everything\nthere is a share of everything except nous, but there\nare some things in which nous, too, is\npresent”). In B12 (the longest extant fragment), Anaxagoras\nclaims that if nous were just another ingredient it\ncould neither know nor rule in the way that it does. \n\nMind/Intellect plays a number of roles in Anaxagoras’ system.  First, it\ninaugurates the rotation of the mass of ingredients; it then controls\nthat rotation, and the local rotations that take place within the\nlarge whirl that is the whole cosmos: \n\nNous then is not only first cause, it also, one might\nsay, is the preserver of order in the cosmos, as it maintains the\nrotations that govern all the natural processes. Anaxagoras does not\nexplain how these processes work, or how nous can\naffect the ingredients. But there is a hint of his reasoning in a\ncomment in Aristotle (Metaphysics I.3.984b15): \n\nJust as we control our bodies by our thoughts, so the cosmos is\ncontrolled by nous; we may be unclear about the\ndetails, but the results are obvious to us. One fundamental point\nabout Anaxagoras’ theory of mind is that he nowhere in the extant\nmaterial identifies mind with a divine principle or god. In fragment\n1018 and in Trojan Women (886), Euripides says that mind is\ngod in each of us, and connects the necessity of the universe with\nZeus and mind, and these claims are thought to have been influenced by\nAnaxagoras’ views. Although later testimonial reports in Aëtius\nand Iamblichus say that Anaxagoras connected nous and\ngod, there are many more reports of his denial of divinity to the\nheavenly bodies and his alleged atheism. \n\nNous is the most powerful thing in the cosmos,\ncontrolling the rotation and all ensouled things. Part of that power\nand control lies in its powers of knowledge. Anaxagoras asserts that\nnous has all judgment and discernment about all things;\nmoreover, this knowledge extends to everything that emerges from the\nmixtures and dissociations caused by the original rotation: \n\nThis suggests a beginning of an answer to the objections lodged\nagainst Anaxagoras’ use of nous as a cause. While\nnous is not the teleological and ethical cause for which Socrates was\nsearching in the Phaedo, nous could serve as an\nultimate explanation. Anaxagoras nowhere says that\nnous arranges things in a certain way because it is best for\nthem to be so, or even suggests something like an Aristotelian final\ncause, (although Sedley 2007 argues that exactly this view is implicit\nin the fragments, contra: Graham, 2009, Sisko 2010a).  Things are the way\nthey are because that is the way things have unfolded\nsince nous first set everything in motion, and as it\ncontinued to move them. (One might compare this to the role of the\nunmoved mover as the ultimate cause in Aristotle’s universe; despite\nbeing the first cause the unmoved mover does not create.) \n\nAnaxagoras links mind and soul in B12: “nous has\ncontrol over all things that have soul, both the larger and the\nsmaller.” This suggests not only that Anaxagoras took the\nactions of humans and animals as the model for how nous\ncontrols the cosmos, but also suggests how nous differs from\nthe other ingredients. He claims that it is the purest and finest of\nall things. Some scholars argue that it is only in Plato that we meet\na genuine notion of the immaterial (Renehan 1980, Sedley 2007), but\nAnaxagoras’ denial that nous is mixed with or partakes of\nother ingredients (while still being in some of them) and his\ninsistence on its fineness and purity may suggest that he is thinking\nof mind as a non-corporeal entity that can pervade and control a body\nor even the whole cosmos without being a material part of it (Curd\n2009). On either interpretation, if\nnous were simply an ordinary ingredient on a par with the\nother basic ingredients, then, as Anaxagoras notes in B12, its relative\nsmallness would allow it to be swamped and overcome\n(“thwarted”) by the other ingredients. \n\nFragment B12 ends with a further discussion of mixture and separation,\nand Anaxagoras’ enunciation of what has come to be called the\n“Principle of Predominance.” After reasserting that no\ningredient is ever fully dissociated or separated from any other\n(except for nous, which is not an ingredient),\nAnaxagoras adds that all nous is alike (that is, cosmic\nnous and mind in us share the same nature), but\n“Nothing else is like anything else, but each one is and was\nmost manifestly those things of which there are the most in it.”\nThus, something is hot, if hot predominates over the cold in it, flesh\nif flesh predominates over other ingredients, and so on. The principle\ndoes not claim that there is any single predominating ingredient at\neach place in the mixture. Rather, the predominance seems to be along\nnumerous lines of possibility: more flesh than blood, more hot than\ncold, more red than green, and so on (Furley 2002).  This need not\nmean that there is more humanity than doghood in a human being (indeed\nit could not mean this, on the account advanced in this article, which\nrules out dogs and humans as Anaxagorean ingredients). Rather, to be a\nhuman being is to have a certain set of predominant characteristics\narranged in a certain way (that arrangement may be the work of soul\n— perhaps nous — in a living thing). \n\nA problem for the Principle of Predominance is to determine what it is\nto be a predominant ingredient, especially given the\nEverything-in-Everything and No Smallest principles. A classic example\nis the following: the gold in this gold ring is that discontinuous\npart of the total mixture in which gold predominates. But now, as\nStrang says, “Consider the gold which predominates as an\ningredient: does it also, like the original piece of gold, contain\nwithin it an admixture of all other substances? If so, it is gold\nbecause gold predominates in it as an ingredient; and we can ask the\nsame question about the ingredient of the ingredient, and so on ad\ninfinitum” (Strang 1963, 101; see also Cornford\n1930). Because there can be no pure gold (there is no pure anything),\nit becomes difficult to see what the gold could be that predominates\nin anything. But if I cannot determine what predominates in it, I\ncannot determine what anything is. \n\nStrang 1963 proposes a solution to the problem. While acknowledging\nthat there can never be pure instances of any ingredient in actuality,\nthere could be such instances in analysis. I can analyze mixtures and\ndetermine predominant ingredients, but I will never be able to produce\na pure instance of such an ingredient.  The problem here is how this\nwould be worked out, and why I can be certain that there are such\nnatures (as we might call them).  Anaxagoras suggests two\nthings. First, in B12 he stresses that nous has the\npower to know and understand all the ingredients (indeed cosmic\nnous apparently knew all this before the rotation began; see\nquotation above). Second, in B21 and B21a he suggests how\nhuman nous (nous in us) can come to such an\nunderstanding by relying on sense perception but moving beyond it in\nthought (see sect. 5. Knowledge). Finally, because the ingredients are\ngenuinely basic entities in the sense required to ground a rational\ncosmology in the Eleatic sense, they must be stable natures in the\nParmenidean sense (for a related account, see Marmodoro\n2015). Anaxagoras is committed to the arguments that ground Eleatic\nmetaphysics; thus he can claim an a priori reason to think\nthat the ingredients can be knowable in the sense required by the\nPrinciple of Predominance.  His epistemological view that humans can\nreach understanding through beginning with sense experience then fits\nwith these metaphysical commitments. \n\nAnaxagoras gave a complete account of the universe: of the heavens,\nthe earth, and geological and meteorological phenomena. The accounts\nof the action of nous and the original rotation and its\nconsequences appear in the fragments: B9 describes the force and\nvelocity of the rotation, B12 and 13 explain the beginning of the\nrotation and the subsequent breaking up and remixing of the mass of\ningredients, while B15 and 16 specify the cosmological consequences of\nthe continued rotation (Curd 2007 and 2008, Graham 2006, Gregory\n2007). Most of the other information comes from the testimonia, but\nthere is enough in the remaining fragments to make it clear that\neverything is ultimately explained by the great rotation set in motion\nby nous.  Further, and intriguingly, Anaxagoras claims that\nthe cosmic rotary motion could produce other worlds like our own. \n\nThe rotation of the mixture begins in a small area, and then spreads\nout through the mass (B12). As the extent of the mixture is unlimited\n(or infinite, apeiron), the rotation and expansion will\ncontinue forever, bringing more and more ingredients into the whirl (a\nsummary of the process is in Gregory 2007). The force and speed of the\nrotation is (according to B9) much faster at the edges, where the\nexpanding rotation meets the as-yet-unmoved mass of ingredients: what\nwe perceive of the rotation (probably the motions of the heavens) is\nmuch slower than the unobserved rotation. The force is enough to pull\napart and rearrange the ingredients: \n\nThere are two sorts of dissociation. First, as the rotation enters the\nas-yet-unmoved mass of ingredients, that mass begins to break up and\nthe ingredients start to shift in their concentrations. This causes\nthe original arrangement of ingredients to break up and begin to be\nrearranged. Because the mixture is a plenum, any separation is at the\nsame time a rearrangement of ingredients. Then, those new\nrearrangements are themselves subject to further break-up and further\nrearrangement. Anaxagoras indicates this in the fragments by using\ndifferent terms for different stages in the process (although he is\nnot completely consistent in these uses). Normally, he uses the notion\nof being separated off (forms of the verb apokrinesthai) for the\ninitial breaking apart of the mass. Re-arrangements are referred to as\nmixing (summisgesthai) or compacting\n(sumpêgnusthai). He also uses “joining\ntogether” (proskrinesthai) as a contrast to the\nseparating off process (apokrinesthai) in B4a and B4b.  When,\nin B17, he claims that passing-away is really dissociation, he uses\nthe word diakrinesthai. This is a later stage than the\nearliest separations off of B1. The primary terms are compound forms\nof the verb krinein, to distinguish. The word can also mean\n“to judge” or “to determine,” and through the\nuse of these compound terms, Anaxagoras reminds his readers that all\nof the changes are ultimately traceable to the action of\nnous, or Mind, that sets the mass moving in the first\ninstance. \n\nOver time, the rotation throws lighter ingredients towards the edges\nof the whirl and pushes the heavier ones to the center (B15), thus\nputting more dark and heavy ingredients like earth in the center and\nthrowing air and aether (fire) away from the center. This gives the\ntraditional Greek picture of our Earth (itself a mixture of all\ningredients, with earth and heavy ores and minerals predominating)\ncovered (in many places) by water, with air and the fiery reaches of\nthe heavens. \n\nThe sun is a mass of fiery metal, and the moon is an earthy lump\n(with no light of its own). The same rotation ultimately produces\nthe stars and planets as well. Sometimes the force of the\nrotation snatches up stones from the surface of the Earth and spins\nthem around the Earth as they gradually rise higher through the force\nof the rotation. Until these bodies are high enough, they remain\nunseen between the Earth and the moon and so sometimes intervene to\nprevent heavenly bodies from being seen by terrestrial observers.\nThe force and shaking of the rotation can cause slippage, and so\nsometimes a star (a flaming mass of rock and iron) is thrown downwards\ntoward the earth as a meteor (such as the one Anaxagoras is supposed to\nhave predicted at Aegospotami; see Galzerano 2019). The fullest account of\nAnaxagoras’ view on meteors can be found in Plutarch’s\nLife of Lysander 12 (59 A12). Anaxagoras is also credited\nwith discovering the causes of eclipses — the interposition of\nanother body between earth and the sun or the moon: sometimes he\ncredits this to the “unseen bodies” mentioned above (see\nGraham and Hintz, 2007, Graham 2013a and 2013b, Taub 2003). According\nto the ancient sources (see esp. A1 and A42), Anaxagoras also gave\nexplanations for the light of the Milky Way, the formation of comets,\nthe inclination of the heavens, the solstices, and the composition of\nthe moon and stars. \n\nThe rotation begun by nous ultimately affects phenomena\non the earth and above the surface of the earth. Anaxagoras claims\nthat the earth is flat, rests on air, and remains where it is because\nof its size (A42; a number of geological and meteorological views\nattributed to Anaxagoras were also apparently held by Anaximenes;\nwhether this is because Anaxagoras was following Anaximenes or because\nthe commentators conflate the two is unclear). Despite the manner of\nits formation, the earth is stationary, not spinning. The (relative)\nflatness of the earth allows water to spread over the earth, with\nmountains and plains rising above the level of the water. The levels\nchange as water is evaporated or added by rain, and as water that has\nbeen trapped in the earth by the rotation makes its way out through\nrivers to the sea. Because the air under the earth is also moving\n(pushed along by the cosmic rotation), it sometimes gets caught up in\nthe crevices of the earthy stuff. When this air cannot make its way\nout, the force of the moving air causes earthquakes. Anaxagoras seems\ndetermined to explain everything. The extant sources report views on\nthunder and lightning, the source of the Nile, the first correct\naccount of the nature of hail, and inquiry into why the sea is\nsalty. He also offered accounts of sense perception and made\ninquiries into embryology. \n\nOne of the more curious aspects of Anaxagoras’ theory is hinted\nat in B4a: \n\nWhere is the “elsewhere” where there would also be\nseparation off, and where there are sun and moon “for them, just\nas with us”? Surprisingly, no ancient sources discuss this\n(although Simplicius, who quotes the fragment, is clearly puzzled by\nit, and argues for a neo-Platonic metaphysical interpretation). Modern\ncommentators have suggested that the other worlds are on the moon\nand/or other planets (Jöhrens 1939, Zeller 1923), elsewhere on\nthe face of our Earth (Cornford, 1934), or even contained within\nourselves (and all other things) so that there are infinite worlds\nwithin worlds (Mansfeld 1980, Schofield 1996, Sisko 2003). There is\nalso the possibility that Anaxagoras has no commitment to the reality\nof these other worlds, but is simply engaging in a thought experiment\nto show how the rotation would work (Fränkel 1969, Vlastos 1975,\nSchofield 1996).  There may be another possibility (Curd 2007). The\nunlimited rotation begins in a small area and expands indefinitely,\npulling more and more of the unlimited mass of as-yet-unmixed\ningredients into the whirl. Such an action could produce smaller local\nrotations within the larger whirl (especially at the expanding edges,\nas in the rotations of hurricane winds) and there, too, separation,\nmixture, and dissociation would occur. Such processes would result in\nthe formation of systems like our own. This is not a\nthought-experiment on Anaxagoras’ part, but a commitment to the\nlaw-likeness of the rotations controlled by\nnous, and an awareness that similar processes will\nproduce similar phenomena.  Our world-system is not unique in the\nuniverse, although there is but one universe (constituted by the\nentire limitless mass of ingredients). \n\nBoth ancient and modern critics have complained that Anaxagoras is\nunclear about the nature of nous (Mind/Intelligence) and its\nrole in his theory (Laks 1993, 2002; Lesher 1995). In B12 Anaxagoras\nclaims that\nnous has all discernment, and that nous “knew\nthem all: the things that are being mixed together, the things that\nare being separated off, and the things that are being\ndissociated.” Further, Anaxagoras remarks that there is\nnous in many things, and that it is alike in all the\nthings that it is in, both large and small (presumably those with\nsoul, i.e., living things). Aristotle says that Anaxagoras conflates\nsoul and mind, and B12 seems to confirm this, insofar as Anaxagoras\nthere treats nous primarily as a mover, yet also says\nthat it controls all things that have soul. It seems likely that in\nthings other than cosmic nous, those compacted or\nmixed-together natural constructs that have soul, the powers of\nnous include both knowing and perceiving. Nowhere do we have\nan analysis of the process of thinking for Anaxagoras, and although\nAristotle and Theophrastus say that earlier thinkers identified\nthinking and sense perception, there is little evidence for this view\nin Anaxagoras (Laks 1999, Warren 2007). \n\nIt seems clear that if nous is to have all discernment and\nto order the cosmos, it must have some knowledge of the contents of the\noriginal mixture (Lesher 1995, Curd 2004). Further, if the\ningredients are fundamentally real things they must have stable and\nknowable natures. (This follows from Parmenides’ arguments\nabout the connection between what-is and what is knowable.) Thus,\nthere is a match between the natures of the ingredients and the\ncognitive power of cosmic nous, but Anaxagoras leaves the\nmechanism unexplained. It seems likely that cosmic nous\njust has a direct intellectual grasp of these nature and acts in\naccordance with that knowledge. \n\nOnly a few fragments and testimonia discuss Anaxagoras’\nviews on perception and knowledge in living things. Aristotle and\nTheophrastus give us some account of his theory of perception, saying,\nmost surprisingly, that for Anaxagoras all sensation is accompanied by\ndiscomfort or pain (A92). Theophrastus links this to\nAnaxagoras’ belief that like is perceived by unlike; on\nTheophrastus’ view, perception is via touch, and unlike things\nproduce some irritation when touched. Theophrastus adduces loud noises\nand very bright light as producers of pain in perceivers, and suggests\nthat the mechanism is the same in all cases of sensation. Some\nirritation will be below the level of awareness for most perceivers,\nwhich is why humans do not normally feel pain when\nperceiving (see Warren 2007 for a good discussion of Anaxagoras on perception). \n\nWhat is the relation between perception and knowledge?\nAnaxagoras does not claim that perception alone is sufficient for\nknowing; nor does he seem to embrace skepticism. Sextus\nEmpiricus, always on the lookout for arguments for and against any\ndogmatic position, gives us most of the evidence for Anaxagoras’\nviews. Says Sextus, of the skeptic’s methodology, “We\nset what is thought in opposition to what appears, as Anaxagoras set\nthe appearance that snow is white in opposition to the claim that snow\nis frozen water, water is black, and therefore snow is black”\n(A97; but see the passage from Cicero in the same testimonium).\nHere Anaxagoras accepts that snow seems to us to be white, but claims\nthat the reality must be that snow is black. The evidence of the\nsenses must be corrected by what we know through thought. In B21,\nAnaxagoras recognizes the weakness of the senses (“Owing to\nfeebleness [of the senses], we are not able to determine the\ntruth”), but in B21a he accepts that sense perception can be a\nstep towards understanding: “appearances are a sight of the\nunseen.” This follows from his own theory, for the evidence\nof our own control of our bodies by our minds, the facts of nutrition\nand growth, and the local revolutions of the heavens are evidence for\nthe workings of cosmic nous, the No-Becoming principle, and\nthe great cosmic revolution. Like other Presocratics, Anaxagoras\nleaves us with no detailed account of how knowledge derives from\nperception through the refinements of thought: Anaxagoras’\naccount can be compared with that of Democritus, where the relation of\nsense-perception and thought is similar and similarly unexplained. \n\nReportedly the first of the Presocratic philosophers to settle\nin Athens, Anaxagoras was a significant figure, not only for later\nphilosophical thinkers, but also for the wider civic culture of his\ntime. He was clearly an important influence on Pericles.\nPlutarch reports: \n\nThat naturalism appears in the dramas of Euripides, who is often\ndescribed as a pupil of Anaxagoras, and in the comedies of\nAristophanes, who satirizes the views of Anaxagoras as well as the\nfigure of Socrates in Clouds. Anaxagoras’ theory\nof the floods of the Nile was known to Herodotus (and may be referred\nto in Aeschylus). Despite stories that they did not get along,\nthere are signs of influence of Anaxagoras on Democritus (in his\naccounts of perception and knowledge) and Anaxagoras’ scientific\nclaims and discoveries affected all the thinkers of his time.\nOnce his views about meteors, hail, and eclipses became known, such\ntopics were always included in scientific accounts of astronomical and\nmeteorological phenomena. In the testimonia, Anaxagoras’\neven temperament was taken as a model of good behavior, and he was\nfamous as a prognosticator of everything from meteor falls to rain\nshowers.  \n\nAnaxagoras’ views appear among Socrates’ survey of\nprevious naturalistic theories of explanation (Phaedo 96a6\nff.). More ominously, Meletus seems to have attributed Anaxagoras’\nclaims about the earthy nature of the moon and stars to Socrates at his\ntrial (see Plato’s Apology 26e7ff., 59 A35). Although\nAnaxagoras’ alleged indictment for impiety was probably as much political\nas a sign of his danger to public religion (attacking Anaxagoras was an\nindirect attack on Pericles), he was seen as important and influential\nenough to qualify to some as an enemy of the polis. \n\nPhilosophically, Anaxagoras’ theories were also widely known and\ninfluential. Some scholars have thought that the author of the Derveni\nPapyrus (found in Northern Greece) was familiar with Anaxagoras’\ntheories (Betegh 2004; Kouremenos et al. 2006), and once he introduced\nMind as a cause, other thinkers followed him. Diogenes of Apollonia\nclaimed that air (as mind and god) directs all things. Zeno of Elea\n(perhaps) and Melissus (certainly) criticize his theory. Anaxagoras’\nview that “each one is and was most manifestly those things of\nwhich there are the most in it” (the principle of Predominance)\nis echoed in Plato’s claims that sensible things acquire their\ncharacters and names from the Forms in which they participate\n(Phaedo 102a10 ff.). Plato even adopts Anaxagoras’ language\nof sharing or participating in (see Furley 2002), and like Anaxagoras’ nous,\nPlatonic forms are “themselves by themselves” in being\nself-explanatory (see Herrmann, 2007). Aristotle, although impatient\nwith the gaps in Anaxagoras’ account of nous, expresses\nadmiration for his recognition that mind has a role to play in guiding\nthe cosmos, and he treats Anaxagoras’ explanation of eclipses as a\nmodel of scientific explanation.","contact.mail":"zeno@purdue.edu","contact.domain":"purdue.edu"}]
