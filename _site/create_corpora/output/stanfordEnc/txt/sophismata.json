Discussions of\nsophismata can be found in treatises of the twelfth century.\nLater they formed an important element of scholarly training in\nuniversities, featuring in different kinds of disputations: on a basic\nlevel the sophismata served to illustrate a theory, but they\nwere also used to test the limits of a theory. The so-called\nsophismata-literature flourished during the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries; evidence of many important developments in logic\nand natural philosophy can be found in texts of this kind, where\nmasters could feel free to investigate problems and develop their own\nviews, much more than they could in more academic and strictly\ncodified literary genres. In the wake of humanists’ opposition\nto the educational practices of traditional universities, the genre of\nsophismata disappeared in the early sixteenth century. \n\nAlthough some medieval theologians — and humanists even more, of\ncourse, like Vivès or Rabelais — used the words\n‘sophism’ or ‘sophist’ as a derogatory\ndesignation for quibbling philosophers,\n‘sophisma’ in medieval philosophical literature\nhas a very precise and technical sense. To avoid any confusion with\nfallacies and badly-constructed arguments, we shall here use the\noriginal term ‘sophisma’ rather than the word\n‘sophism’ (which even nowadays has a pejorative\nconnotation). \nA sophisma has several important characteristics. First of\nall, a sophisma proper is a sentence rather than an\nargument. In particular, a sophisma is a sentence that  \nHere are some some examples of kind (1), sentences that are odd or\nhave odd consequences:  \nAs examples of kind (2), ambiguous sentences that can be true\nor false depending on how they are interpreted, consider:  \nAs an example of kind (3), sentences that are not puzzling in\nthemselves but only when they occur in a definite context\n(“case,” casus), consider:  \nThis sentence is paradoxical, and is one of the forms the Liar\nparadox. As another example of kind (3) consider:  \nOnce the odd, ambiguous or puzzling sophisma-sentence is put\nforward, one should try to understand what it means, what it implies,\nand how it fits into or contradicts the particular theory under\nconsideration. This is called “solving the\nsophisma,” and it is the aim of the entire discussion.\nThe way solutions are sought and established is similar to the highly\nformalized scholastic method for determining a “question”:\n \nOur first example comes from Peter of Spain’s\nSyncategoreumata, chapter 4:  \nIn accordance with step (1), the pro and con\narguments run: \nProof: The sentence ‘Every animal is irrational’ is false,\nand the only counterinstance is man. Therefore the sophisma\nis true. \nDisproof: Every animal but man is irrational. Therefore, every animal\nbut this man is irrational. And that is false. \nThis particular sophisma is put forward to test the logical\nbehaviour of the syncategorematic word ‘but’\n(preter), more specifically, to consider the question of what\nis excepted when we use an exceptive word. \nIn accordance with step (2), Peter of Spain solves the\nsophisma by saying that it is true without qualification, and\nthat the argument pro is sound. \nIn accordance with step (3), the argument contra is rejected\non the grounds that it is a fallacy, because in the sentence it starts\noff with, ‘Every animal but man is irrational,’ the\nexpression ‘man’ has simple supposition, that is, it\nstands for man in general, whereas in the second sentence,\n‘Therefore every animal but this man is irrational,’ the\nexpression ‘this man’ has personal supposition, that is,\nit stands for an individual man. A second mistake in the disproof is\nthat it proceeds from a combination of something less general with the\ndistributive sign ‘every’ to a combination of something\nthat is more general with the distributive sign ‘every’:\nin the first sentence, ‘every animal’ ranges over every\nanimal other than man, whereas in the second sentence, the expression\n‘every animal’ comprehends not only all the animals, but\nalso every man other than this one. \nThe underlying logical problem in this sophisma according to\nPeter’s exposition is the question of what kind of distribution\nis involved in propositions containing an exceptive expression in\ncombination with the universal sign ‘every’. In this case,\nthe solution to the sophisma is quite straightforward, as the\ndisproof rests on an unwarranted change in distribution throughout the\nargument. \nAnother relatively simple example comes from Albert of Saxony,\nSophismata, sophisma xi. The sophisma runs:\n \nIn accordance with step (1), here are the pro and\ncontra arguments:  \nProof: The sophisma is a copulative sentence (in modern\nlogical terminology, a conjunction) each part of which is true;\ntherefore the sophisma is true, since its analysis becomes:\n[All men are donkeys or men] and [donkeys are donkeys].  \nDisproof: The sophisma is a disjunctive sentence each part of\nwhich is false; therefore the sophisma is false, since its\nanalysis becomes: [All men are donkeys] or [men and donkeys are\ndonkeys]. \nThis is a sophisma of the second kind above, one that rests\non an ambiguity and can be read with a true interpretation or with a\nfalse interpretation. Many such sophismata, although not this\none, resist being translated from Latin into another language without\nlosing the ambiguity. For example, the sentence ‘aliquem asinum\nomnis homo videt’ can be translated by ‘Every man sees a\ndonkey’ as well as by ‘There is a donkey that every man\nsees’. Similarly, in solving sophismata, sometimes\nLatin word order is used as an arbitrary code for interpreting the\nsentence. For example, according to William Heytesbury, when the word\n‘infinite’ is placed at the beginning of a sentence and\nbelongs to the subject, it has to be interpreted as a syncategorematic\nterm; in any other case, it is usually interpreted as a categorematic\nterm (Heytesbury, Sophismata, sophisma xviii,\nfol.130va). Such word-order codes might seem like reasonable\nregimentations of language to a Latin-speaker, but in translation they\noften seem quite implausible and forced. No such problems arise with\nthis example. (For clarity, square brackets have been inserted into\nthe proof and disproof above, in order to indicate the ambiguity of\nthe sophisma.)  \nIn accordance with step (2) above, Albert of Saxony, who discusses\nthis sophisma, solves it by just saying that it is either\ntrue or false depending on which interpretation we choose. He then\ntakes the opportunity to review the basic principles governing the\ntruth-value of copulative and disjunctive sentences. \nIn accordance with step (3), we would normally be required to refute\nthe opposite answer. In this case, however, there is nothing to\nrefute, since Albert’s solution accepts both the pro\nand the contra arguments (for different readings of the\nsophisma). \nIn general, a sophisma provided a good opportunity to discuss\nproblems related to a specific theoretical issue. For example, the\nsophisma ‘Album fuit disputaturum’\n(‘The white [thing] was about to dispute’) in\nthirteenth-century Parisian literature elicited discussions of\nproblems connected with the theory of reference in tensed contexts,\nand also provided an opportunity to refute the positions others held\non this very controversial subject. This is why Pinborg 1977 (p. xv)\nsays, with reference to the body of literature devoted to discussions\nof sophismata, that at Paris in the thirteenth century,\n“the sophismata seem — within the faculty of arts\n— to play a role analogous to the Quaestiones\nquodlibetales [quodlibetal questions] in the faculty of\ntheology.” The Catalogue of 13th Century Sophismata\n(Ebbesen and Goubier 2010) provides an extensive list of logical\nproblems and distinctions that were brought up under the guise of a\nsophisma. Again, many grammatical problems were also dealt\nwith in this way. \nIt is important to recognize that many sophismata contain\nsyncategorematic words that are responsible for their odd, ambiguous\nor puzzling character. They can be difficult to interpret, specially\nwhen more than one syncategorematic word occurs in one and the same\nsentence. In the sophismata literature, discussions of\nproblematic sentences are usually accompanied by an explanation of the\ndistinctions governing the use of syncategorematic words. In turn such\ndistinctions can help to interpret the sentence at issue. \nAn example of such a distinction is the following. The\nsophisma ‘Only God being God is necessary’\n(‘Tantum deum esse deum est necessario’) contains\nthe syncategorematic word ‘only’\n(‘tantum’). The sophisma is solved by\nmaking a distinction between two different functions of the word\n‘only’, in that the exclusion it makes can pertain to the\nexpression ‘God’, or to the entire phrase ‘God being\nGod’. In the former case the sentence is true, but in the latter\nit is false (Ebbesen and Goubier 2010, vol. I, p. 122). Another\nexample of a problematic sentence containing the disjunctive\nexpression ‘or’ is the sophisma ‘Every\nproposition or its contradictory opposite is true’. Some authors\nconsidered this proposition as true, but others thought it was\nambiguous. In one way, the distribution of ‘every’ could\nbe taken as ranging over the disjunction, in which case the\nproposition reads ‘Any proposition or its contradictory is\ntrue’, which is true. In another way, the disjunction could be\ntaken to cover the distribution, in which case the proposition reads\n‘Every proposition is true or every contradictory opposite is\ntrue’, which is false. A final example of a distinction concerns\nthe sophisma ‘The white can be black’ (an awkward\ntranslation of the sentence ‘Album potest esse\nnigrum’), which can be taken to mean either ‘The\nthing that is white can be black’, which is true, or ‘It\ncan be the case that the white thing is black’ (at the same\ntime, that is), which is false. The truth or falsity of the\nproposition then depends on a scope distinction regarding the\nexpression, ‘can be’. \nThe expression ‘syncategorematic word’ should be taken in\na broad sense here; it includes not only classical syncategorematic\nwords such as ‘and’, ‘if’,\n‘every’, etc., but also expressions such as\n‘infinite’ or ‘whole’, which can be used both\ncategorematically and syncategorematically. Thus, the sentence\n‘Infinita sunt finita’ (‘The infinite are\nfinite’ — another example of a sophisma that\ncannot be translated into English without disambiguating it) is false\nif ‘infinite’ is used categorematically, for in that case\nit reads, ‘Things that are infinite are finite.’ But it is\ntrue if ‘infinite’ is used syncategorematically, for in\nthat case it reads, ‘Finite things are infinite in number’\nor ‘There are infinitely many finite things’ (See\nHeytesbury, Sophismata, sophisma xviii, fol.130va).\nThis is another example of the kind of distinction that was used to\nsolve the sophisma. \nMany sophismata too are what medieval logicians called\n‘exponible sentences’\n(‘exponibilia’); these are sentences that appear\nto be simple but actually imply several other sentences into which\nthey can be decomposed. For example, the sentence, ‘A\ndiffers from B’, was said to be equivalent to\n‘A exists and B exists and A is not\nB’, whereas the sentence, ‘A ceases to be\nwhite’, was said to be equivalent either to ‘Now A\nis white and immediately after this A will not be white’\nor to ‘Now A is not white and immediately before this\nA was white’, depending on the theory. \nDiscussions of sophismata were used to disentangle problems\nof logic and grammar, but their subject matter included concepts\nfeatured in physics and theology as well. While the problems at issue\nin the sophismata are taken to be logico-grammatical, it is\npossible to distinguish between logical, grammatical and physical\nsophismata. Furthermore, many standard sophismata of\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries feature God or the Antichrist,\nentities that belong to the domain of theology. As Ebbesen points out\n(1997, p. 151), these entities could play an interesting role in\nsophismatic discussions because they were considered to have unusual\nqualities, which could make for intriguing logical puzzles. Yet\ntheological sophismata as such are extremely rare.  \nAs seen above, logical sophismata are closely connected to\ndiscussions of syncategoremata. The aim of these discussions is to\ndetermine the truth-value of a particular sentence containing (a)\nsyncategorematic word(s), or the truth-value of some other problematic\nsentence (including, for example, sentences involving self-reference),\nbut also to discuss specific topics exemplified in it, such as:  \nThe aim here is to discuss concepts featuring in physics, such as\nmotion, change, velocity, intension and remission of forms, maxima and\nminima, time, etc. Examples of sophismata in this domain are\nsentences containing the syncategoremata ‘begins’ and\n‘ceases’: ‘Socrates ceases to be not ceasing to\nbe’, ‘Nothing is true except in this instant’, and\n‘What begins to be ceases to be’. But, as seen above with\nthe sophisma ‘The infinite are finite’, problems\nlike these are treated as logical and conceptual problems. This\nlogico-semantical approach to physical problems is characteristic of\nmedieval natural philosophy and should be kept in mind when we wonder\nto what extent medieval physics can be considered a precursor to\nmodern physics.  \nWith respect to so-called ‘physical sophismata,’\nspecial attention should be paid to certain fourteenth century English\nauthors known as the “Oxford Calculators”, e.g., Richard\nKilvington, William Heytesbury, Thomas Bradwardine, Richard and Roger\nSwineshead. These philosophers developed a distinctively\n“English-style” of sophismata. Based on the\ntheological doctrine of the absolute power of God, the distinction\nbetween what is physically possible and what is logically possible\n(where non-contradiction is the only limit) allowed these authors to\ndevise imaginary thought experiments. For example, suppose that\nA is a distance to be traversed which Socrates cannot traverse,\nand that his power is increased until Socrates can traverse distance\nA completely, and that Socrates’ power is not increased\nfurther: Is the sophisma ‘Socrates will begin to be\nable to traverse distance A’ true or false? (Richard\nKilvington, Sophismata, sophisma 27, in Kretzmann\n1990, p.60). Thought experiments such as these led these authors to\ndevelop, among other things, a theorem for uniformly accelerated\nmotion (e.g., Thomas Bradwardine’s Mean Speed Theorem). \nIn the Middle Ages the label ‘grammatical\nsophismata’ was used for the sophismata that\ndealt with grammatical well-formedness (congruitas) and\ngrammatico-semantic completeness. Sophismata such as\n‘Love is a verb’, ‘O Master’, ‘It rueth\nme’, and ‘I run’ gave rise to very pointed\ndiscussions concerning grammatical categories and theories. For\nexample, does a change in word order change the meaning of a\nproposition? Can a participle be a subject? How should we interpret\ninterjections? Can ‘est’ (‘is’) be\nused impersonally?  \nKneepkens (2015) has drawn our attention to a remarkable collection of\nsophismata, of French or English origin, presumably dating\nfrom early thirteenth century, which exclusively discusses problematic\nsentences taken from biblical, liturgical, and other religious\nsources. This collection has the characteristics of grammatical\nsophismata, but in addition focuses on metaphorical features\nof religious language, as well as making use of rhetoric as an\nanalytical tool (Kneepkens 2015, p. 320).  \nEbbesen has identified one sophisma that deserves the label\n‘theological’ (in the sense, that is, of an\n“exception to the general rule that the sophism is not\na theological genre” (Ebbesen 1997, pp. 151–152). The\nsophisma in question runs ‘Deus est eodem modo in\ndyabolo sicud fuit in beata virgine’(‘God is in the\nsame way in the devil as he was in the Blessed Virgin’). The\nreason why this could count as a theological sophisma is that\nthe question that is raised in it, about how God is present in\ncreatures, is theological in nature. Another theological\nsophism investigated by Ebbesen is the sophisma,\n‘Deus scit quicquid scivit’ (‘God knows\nwhatever he has known’), which was widely discussed in the\nstandard sophismata literature. The sentence elicits\nquestions pertaining not only to the logical behaviour of the verb\n‘scire’ (‘to know’), but also to the\nspecifically theological issue of the object of God’s knowledge\n(Ebbesen 1997, p. 154ff.). \nThe first and most evident role of sophismata is pedagogical.\nIn theoretical treatises, sophismata can play various roles.\nThey can be used to explain a given statement or rule, illustrate a\ndistinction or an ambiguity, show what would follow if a rule were\nviolated, or test the limits of a theory.  \nIn addition, although some differences can be identified between the\nParis and the Oxford traditions, sophismata are important as\noral exercises (disputations) in a student’s training in\nphilosophy, especially in the first years of universitary education in\nthe Faculty of Arts. Nevertheless, it is clear that, while\nHeytesbury’s Rules for Solving Sophismata is written\nfor undergraduate students — at Oxford\n‘sophista’ was the official name given to\nstudents who had disputed “on sophismata”\n(“de sophismatibus”) for about two years —\nthis is probably not the case for his Sophismata, in which\nthe discussions are much more complicated. \nIt is no exaggeration to say that sophismata in the Faculty\nof Arts were as important as biblical exegesis in the Faculty of\nTheology. \nIn the Introduction of the Catalogue (Ebbesen and Goubier\n2010, vol. I), we find an elaborate description of the medieval genre\nof sophismata. This genre was based on disputational\npractices in medieval universities. In its most basic form, it\nincluded the discussion of a problematic proposition, beginning with\nthe presentation of the proposition, followed by a proof, a disproof,\nand a solution, sometimes accompanied by a response to the opposing\narguments (see our section 2.2). The joint discsussion of these steps\nwas known as corpus sophismatis. A respondent’s\nsolution to the sophisma could be followed by an attack,\nleading to yet another exchange of arguments. In other instances the\ndiscussion of the sophisma could continue with a discussion\nof related problems, the first of which was often dealt with in an\nelaborate way. These kinds of sophismata are quite long. \nSophismata are found in a variety of texts, which scholars\nhave categorized into different kinds. Abstractiones\ntreatises are collections of sophismata arranged by a type of\nsyncategorematic word (e.g., exceptive words, exclusive words,\nconditional words, disjunctive words, and so on), or sometimes by the\ndistinction that is used to solve them. The material covered in each\nsophisma is mostly confined to a corpus.\nSyncategoremata are treatises devoted to syncategorematic\nwords; in these treatises sophismata are used to illustrate\nor to give more refined explanations of the logical behaviour of the\ndifferent syncategorematic words (or kinds of syncategorematic words).\nIn Distinctiones treatises, the starting points are\ndistinctions or logical rules connected with sentences that contain a\nsyncategorematic word. The material in these treatises is usually\norganized around the type of syncategorematic word at issue. Besides\nthese different kinds of treatises (the boundaries of which, however,\nare not very clear), we also find collections of sophismata\nthat seem to be (fictional or faithful) reports of oral disputations.\nThese collections can contain grammatical sophismata, but the\nlatter are also found in separate, rather loosely-organized,\ntreatises. Sophismata also play an important role in general\nmanuals of logic, and in other works — often written by the same\nauthors, or by different authors working in the same milieu as the\nformer collections — with titles such as On Exponibles,\nOn Consequences, Sophistry, etc. \nEven if there are technical distinctions among these types of\ntreatises, all of them play the same roles mentioned above: they\nprovide students with logical skills that can be applied to any\nsubject whatsoever.","contact.mail":"joke.spruyt@maastrichtuniversity.nl","contact.domain":"maastrichtuniversity.nl"}]
