He is\ntraditionally referred to as “L.E.J. Brouwer”, with full\ninitials, but was called “Bertus” by his friends. \n\n\n\n\nIn classical mathematics, he founded modern topology by\nestablishing, for example, the topological invariance of dimension and\nthe fixpoint theorem. He also gave the first correct definition of\ndimension.\n\n\n\nIn philosophy, his brainchild is intuitionism, a revisionist\nfoundation of mathematics. Intuitionism views mathematics as a free\nactivity of the mind, independent of any language or Platonic realm of\nobjects, and therefore bases mathematics on a philosophy of mind. The\nimplications are twofold. First, it leads to a form of constructive\nmathematics, in which large parts of classical mathematics are\nrejected. Second, the reliance on a philosophy of mind introduces\nfeatures that are absent from classical mathematics as well as from\nother forms of constructive mathematics: unlike those, intuitionistic\nmathematics is not a proper part of classical mathematics.\n\n\n\nBrouwer studied at the (municipal) University of Amsterdam where his\nmost important teachers were Diederik Korteweg and Gerrit Mannoury. \nKorteweg (1848–1941) was professor of mathematics, mechanics and\nastronomy at the University of Amsterdam from 1881–1918; the\nlast five years as extraordinarius, so as to make place for\nBrouwer. Around 1900, Korteweg was the most important and influential\nmathematician in the Netherlands, and he contributed much to the\ninternationalisation of Dutch mathematics. A mathematical physicist\ntrained by van der Waals, he had a particular interest in mechanics\nand thermodynamics. Among his many results, the best-known is probably\nthe Korteweg-de Vries equation, describing the behaviour of waves in a\nshallow channel. Korteweg also had a strong historical interest, and\nwas chief editor of vols. XI–XV of Christiaan Huygens’ collected\nworks (1908–1925). Part of the correspondence with his PhD\nstudent Brouwer concerned the unification of physical theories (see\nvan Stigt, 1990, pp. 490–498).\n \nMannoury (1867–1956) was a philosopher, mathematician,\npsychoanalyst, accountant, and political activist (Kirkels, 2019). Largely an\nautodidact, it was he who introduced in the Netherlands both topology\n(in a series of papers of 1897–1900) and Peano’s symbolic logic\n(in a lecture in 1903). In 1903 he was\nappointed privaatdocent (unpaid lecturer) in the logical\nfoundations of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where\nBrouwer was among his first and most enthusiastic students. His\nlectures have been published, in shortened and revised form, as\nMannoury, 1909. But it was Mannoury’s earlier, topological papers that\ninfluenced the young Brouwer decisively: the “undertone”\nof that work, Brouwer said in a speech in 1946, had changed his view\nof mathematics from a collection of “truths fascinating by their\nimmovability, but horrifying by their lifelessness, like stones from\nbarren mountains of disconsolate infinity” to a concern with\nwhat is “built ... out of the structural elements of our\nthinking” (Brouwer, 1946B, pp. 192–193). Brouwer was also\nvery interested in Mannoury’s reflections on the uses and misuses of\nlanguage in mathematics and philosophy. In 1917 Mannoury became\nprofessor extraordinarius, in 1918 ordinarius at the\nUniversity of Amsterdam, succeeding Korteweg at the chair of analytic\nand descriptive geometry, mechanics and philosophy of mathematics,\nuntil 1937. A large part of his career was devoted to furthering the\ndevelopment of significs, an analysis of communicative acts\nstarting from the ideas laid down by Victoria, Lady Welby in her paper\n“Sense, Meaning and Interpretation” (Welby, 1896). Brouwer\nwas also involved in that project. \nBrouwer’s principal (intuitionistic) students were Maurits Belinfante,\nArend Heyting, and Johan de Iongh; Heyting, in turn, was the teacher\nof Anne Troelstra and Dirk van Dalen, and de Iongh of Wim\nVeldman. Brouwer’s classes were also attended by Max Euwe, later to\nbecome world chess champion, who published a game-theoretical paper on\nchess from the intuitionistic point of view (Euwe, 1929), and who\nwould much later deliver Brouwer’s funeral speech. Among Brouwer’s\nassistants were Heyting, Hans Freudenthal, Karl Menger, and Witold\nHurewicz, the latter two of whom were not intuitionistically\ninclined. The most influential supporter of Brouwer’s intuitionism\noutside the Netherlands at the time was, for a number of years,\nHermann Weyl (whose adaptation of intuitionistic analysis was not\nwholly coherent); also Husserl’s student Oskar Becker should be\nmentioned. \n\nBrouwer seems to have been an independent and brilliant man of high\nmoral standards, but with an exaggerated sense of justice, making him\nat times pugnacious. As a consequence, in his life he energetically\nfought many battles. To Mannoury’s daughter, Brouwer once said:\n“Indeed, your father is one of the few people with whom I have\nnever had a quarrel. But he brought out the good in people, and I the\nbad” (Schmitz, 1990, p. 383). \n\nFrom 1914 to 1928, Brouwer was member of the editiorial board of the\nMathematische Annalen, and he was the founding editor of\nCompositio Mathematica, which first appeared in 1934. \n\nHe was a member of, among others, the Royal Dutch Academy of\nSciences, the Royal Society in London, the Preußische Akademie\nder Wissenschaften in Berlin, and the Akademie der Wissenschaften in\nGöttingen. \n\nBrouwer received honorary doctorates from the universities of Oslo\n(1929) and Cambridge (1954), and was made Knight in the Order of the\nDutch Lion in 1932. \n\n1881 February 27, born in Overschie (since 1941\npart of Rotterdam), The Netherlands. \n\n1897 Enters the University of Amsterdam to study\nmathematics and physics. \n\n1904 Obtains doctorandus title (MSc degree)\nin mathematics; first publication (on rotations in four dimensional\nspace); marries Lize de Holl (born 1870). They would have no children,\nbut Lize had a daughter from an earlier marriage. They move to\nBlaricum, near Amsterdam, where they would live for the rest of their\nlives, although they also had houses in other places. \n\n1904–1907 Doctoral studies. His mathematical\nand philosophical notebooks towards his dissertation show strong\ninfluence from notably Cantor, Hilbert, Russell, Poincaré, and\nCouturat. He is aware of the Frege–Hilbert debate, and in that\nmatter sides with Frege. Some remarks betray a form of anti-semitism\nthat, unfortunately, often appeared in language at the time, as\ncodification of a common prejudice; an occasional remark goes further\nand contrasts Jewish people unfavourably to Germanic ones. No such\nutterances are known from other periods in his life; compare also the\nentries for 1934–1935 and 1940–1945 below. There is no meaningful\nconnection between this fleeting anti-semitism and the philosophical\nviews on mathematics, language, and society he set out in his\ndissertation and developed over the rest of his life.\n \n\n1907 Obtains doctor title with\ndissertation On the Foundations of Mathematics, under\nsupervision of Korteweg at the University of Amsterdam. (The original\nDutch title of the dissertation was ‘Over de Grondslagen der\nWiskunde’. The present entry will for the most part refer to works\ncited by using the titles of English translations, with the\nbibliography providing information about the original publications.)\nIt marks the beginning of his intuitionistic reconstruction of\nmathematics. Later that year, Brouwer’s wife graduates and becomes a\npharmacist. All his life, Brouwer did the bookkeeping for her and\nfilled out the tax forms, and sometimes he assisted behind the\ncounter. \n\n1908 First publication of his argument against the\ngeneral validity of the Principle of the Excluded Middle in “The\nunreliability of the logical principles”. First participation in\nan international conference, the Fourth International Conference of\nMathematicians in Rome. \n\n1909–1913 In a very productive four years,\nBrouwer founds modern topology, as a chapter of classical mathematics.\nHighlights: invariance of dimension, fixed point theorem, mapping\ndegree, definition of dimension. As van Dalen (2005, p. 450) observes,\nBrouwer’s definition of dimension seems to be the first reformulation\nof an inductive definition as a game. A pause in his intuitionistic\nprogram. \n\n1909 Becomes privaatdocent (unpaid lecturer)\nat the University of Amsterdam. Inaugural lecture “The Nature of\nGeometry”. \n\n1909 Meets Hilbert in the Dutch seaside resort of\nScheveningen. Brouwer much admires Hilbert and describes their meeting\nin a letter to a friend as “a beautiful new ray of light through\nmy life” (Brouwer & Adama van Scheltema, 1984, p. 100). Twenty\nyears later, Brouwer’s relation with Hilbert would turn sour. \n\n1911 First appearance of the names\n“formalism” and “intuitionism” in Brouwer’s\nwritings, in a review of Mannoury’s Methodological\nand philosophical remarks on elementary mathematics (1909). \n\n1912 Elected member of the Royal Academy of\nSciences (during World War II “Dutch Academy of Sciences”,\nafterward “Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences”). \n\n1912 Appointed full professor\nextraordinarius in the field of set theory, function\ntheory, and axiomatics. His philosophical inaugural lecture\n“Intuïtionisme en Formalisme” is translated into English as\n“Intuitionism and Formalism” and thus becomes, in 1913, the\nfirst publication on intuitionism in that language. \n\n1913 Appointed full professor ordinarius,\nsucceeding Korteweg, who had generously offered to vacate his chair for\nthe purpose. \n\n1914 Invited to join the editorial board of the\nMathematische Annalen; accepts the honour. \n\n1918 Brouwer begins the systematic intuitionistic\nreconstruction of mathematics with his paper “Founding\nSet Theory Independently of the Principle of the Excluded Middle. Part\nOne, General Set Theory”. \n\n1919 Receives offers for professorships in\nGöttingen and in Berlin; declines both. \n\n1919 “Intuitionistic Set Theory” is the first piece of\nintuitionistic mathematics in a widely read international journal, the\nJahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung. \n\n1920 Start of the “Grundlagenstreit”\n(Foundational Debate) with Brouwer’s lecture at the\n“Naturforscherversammlung” in Bad Nauheim, published in\n1921, “Does Every Real Number Have a\nDecimal Expansion?”; the debate was amplified by Weyl’s defence of intuitionism\nin 1921, “On the New Foundational Crisis of\nMathematics”; Hilbert responds in 1922,\n“The New\nGrounding of Mathematics”. \n\n1922 Co-founds, with Gerrit Mannoury, the man of letters \nFrederik van Eeden, and others, the “Signific Circle”, \naiming at spiritual and\npolitical progress through language reform. The Circle ends its meetings in\n1926, but Mannoury continues its work. \n\n1926 Lecture in Göttingen; as a result of a\ngroup dinner at Emmy Noether’s house, Hilbert and Brouwer are (for a\nbrief period) on good terms again. \n\n1927 Lecture series in Berlin; Hans Reichenbach and\nAndré Weil are in the audience, as is Brouwer’s later assistant\nHans Freudenthal. The newspaper Berliner Tageblatt proposes a\npublic debate between Brouwer and Hilbert, to be held in its pages,\nbut for some reason this is not realised. Neither does Brouwer\ncomplete the book he is invited to write by the German publisher\nWalter de Gruyter. The lectures and an incomplete book are published\nposthumously (Brouwer, 1992). \n\n1928 March 10 and 14: two lectures in Vienna.\nGödel is in the audience, as is Wittgenstein. It is said that the\nfirst lecture made Wittgenstein return to philosophy. Brouwer spends a\nday with Wittgenstein. \n\n1928 April: conversations with Husserl, who is in\nAmsterdam to lecture. \n\n1928 Conflict over the Bologna conference. The German\nmathematicians are, for the first time since the ending of World War\nI, admitted to an international conference again, but not quite as\nequals. Brouwer insists that this is not fair, and that the conference\nshould therefore be boycotted. Hilbert, who does not share this view,\nis much chagrined by Brouwer’s action and attends the conference as\nthe leader of the German delegation, the largest present. \n\n1928–1929 “Mathematische Annalenstreit”,\nthe conflict in the editorial board of Mathematische\nAnnalen. Hilbert, thinking he is about to die, feels a need to\nmake sure that after his death Brouwer will not become too\ninfluential, and expels him from the board in an unlawful way.\n(Hilbert’s motivation as described here is documented in letters from\npeople close to him: Carathéodory to Einstein, October 20,\n1928; Blumenthal to the publisher and editors of the Mathematische\nAnnalen, November 16, 1928; Born to Einstein, November 20,\n1928. Copies of these letters are in the Brouwer Papers \nat the Noord-Hollands Archief in Haarlem. \nRelevant quotations from these can be found in van Dalen,\n2005, p. 604 and p. 613.) Einstein, also member of the board,\nrefuses to support Hilbert’s action and does not want to have anything\nto do with the whole affair; most other board members do not want to\nirritate Hilbert by opposing him. Brouwer vehemently protests. In the\nend, the whole board is dissolved and immediately reassembled without\nBrouwer, in a strongly reduced size (in particular, Einstein and\nCarathéodory decline). The conflict leaves Brouwer mentally\nbroken and isolated, and puts an end to a very creative decade in his\nwork. Now that the two main contestants are no longer able to carry it\non, the “Grundlagenstreit” is over. \n\n1928–1930 Conflict with Karl Menger over the\npriority for the first correct definition of the notion of\ndimension. \n\n1929 August: theft of Brouwer’s briefcase on the\ntram in Brussels, and with it of his mathematical notebook. When\nneither the police nor a private detective hired for the purpose is\nable to find it again, he despairs of ever being able to reconstruct\nits contents. Brouwer later said that this loss was instrumental in the\nshift of his main interest from mathematics to philosophy. \n\n1929 Begins preparations for the foundation of a\nnew mathematical journal. \n\n1934 Appearance of the first issue of Brouwer’s own\ninternational journal, entitled Compositio Mathematica. \n\n1934 Lecture series in Geneva, on invitation of\nFerdinand Gonseth. Plans for a course on intuitionistic mathematics\nin Göttingen come very far, but are, in the end, not realised. \n\n1934–1935 Ludwig Bieberbach, a German member of\nthe editorial board of\nCompositio Mathematica who in 1933\nhad joined the National Socialist movement by entering the SA,\nasks Brouwer to remove the Jewish members from that board. \nBrouwer refuses; Bieberbach resigns.\n \n\n1935–1941 Member of the municipal council of\nBlaricum for the local Neutral Party (in 1939 he wins the elections by\nreceiving 310 of the 1601 votes). \n\n1940–1945 During the German Occupation of the\nNetherlands in World War II, Brouwer assists the resistance by letting\nthem use storage space in the Mathematical Institute, of which he was\nthe director. He offers hiding places to Jews and other persecuted\npersons in small houses on his premises (as testified by a neighbour’s\ndaughter, herself involved in these operations, in van Dalen 2005,\nvol. 2, p. 772–773). In 1943, he advises the students to sign\nthe declaration of loyalty demanded by the Germans; when some students\nrefuse and go into hiding, Brouwer and Heyting visit them to continue\ntheir education. Part of Brouwer’s explanation, after the war, for\nthe advice to sign is that signing would provide the students with the\nrelative peace needed to build up and carry out resistance\nactivities. He is met with skepticism (but is supported by Mannoury).\nBecause of this and some similar perhaps unfortunate attempts at\nshrewdness during the occupation, after the liberation he is suspended\nfor a few months. Deeply offended, Brouwer considers emigration to\nSouth Africa or the USA. \n1941 and 1944 Fires in Brouwer’s house destroy\nsignificant parts of his archives and library.  \n\n1942 Publishes three short notes again on\nintuitionistic foundations, the first since 1933. \n\n1945–1950 Conflict over Compositio\nMathematica. The journal had not appeared during the war, and an\neffort is made to bring it back to life. Difficulties in assembling a\nnew board of editors arise because of Brouwer’s damaged reputation. In\nthe end, Brouwer’s name remains on the title page, but in effect he is\nremoved from the board of the journal he had founded. \n\n1947–1951 Annual lecture series in Cambridge,\nEngland. Brouwer plans to turn them into a book, but this does not\nhappen. However, he completes five of the planned six chapters, and\nthese are published poshumously (Brouwer, 1981). \n\n1948 Resumes his foundational program with a paper\nthat exploits the notion of the creating subject. Beginning of another\ncreative period. \n\n1949 Opposes a plan to have his collected papers\npublished, on the ground that he has no time to write annotations that\nreflect his original as well as his present views on them, which he\nconsiders would be the scientifically responsible thing to do. \n\n1951 Retires from the University of\nAmsterdam. Cooling off of his relationship with Arend Heyting, his\nsuccessor at the post of director of the Mathematical Institute, as a\nresult of disagreement over the exact role the retired Brouwer could\nstill play there. \n\n1952 Lectures in London and in Cape Town. \n\n1953 Lectures in Helsinki, where he stays with Von\nWright. Lecture tour through the USA (among others MIT, Princeton,\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison, Berkeley, Chicago) and Canada\n(Canadian Mathematical Congress in Kingston, Ontario). In Princeton,\nhe visits Gödel. \n\n1955 Publishes his last new paper (based on his\nlecture at the Boole conference in Dublin the year before). \n\n1959 Death of Mrs Brouwer, 89 years old. Brouwer\ndeclines an offer for a 1-year position at the University of British\nColumbia in Vancouver. \n\n1962 Brouwer is offered a position in Montana. \n\n1966 December 2: dies in Blaricum, The Netherlands,\n85 years old, when he is hit by a car in front of his house.\nHis library and archives are dispersed.\nBeginning in the 1970s, \nWalter van Stigt and Dirk van Dalen reconstitute the archives\nas much as possible;\nthe Brouwer Papers are now kept at the Noord-Hollands Archief in Haarlem. \n\nBased on his philosophy of mind, on which Kant and Schopenhauer were\nthe main influences, Brouwer characterised mathematics primarily as\nthe free activity of exact thinking, an activity which is founded on\nthe pure intuition of (inner) time. No independent realm of objects\nand no language play a fundamental role. He thus strived to avoid the\nScylla of platonism (with its epistemological problems) and the\nCharybdis of formalism (with its poverty of content). As, on Brouwer’s\nview, there is no determinant of mathematical truth outside the\nactivity of thinking, a proposition only becomes true when the subject\nhas experienced its truth (by having carried out an appropriate mental\nconstruction); similarly, a proposition only becomes false when the\nsubject has experienced its falsehood (by realizing that an\nappropriate mental construction is not possible). Hence Brouwer can\nclaim that “there are no non-experienced truths” (Brouwer,\n1975, p.488). \n\nBrouwer was prepared to follow his philosophy of mind to its ultimate\nconclusions; whether the reconstructed mathematics was compatible or\nincompatible with classical mathematics was a secondary question, and\nnever decisive. In thus granting philosophy priority over traditional\nmathematics, he showed himself a revisionist. And indeed, whereas\nintuitionistic arithmetic is a subsystem of classical arithmetic, in\nanalysis the situation is different: not all of classical analysis is\nintuitionistically acceptable, but neither is all of intuitionistic\nanalysis classically acceptable. Brouwer accepted this consequence\nwholeheartedly. \nThe following is a brief history of Brouwer’s ideas in philosophy,\nmathematics, and logic. There is also a more detailed separate article\non\n The Development of Intuitionistic Logic. \n\nBrouwer’s little book Life, Art and Mysticism of 1905, while\nnot developing his foundations of mathematics as such, is a key to\nthose foundations as developed in his dissertation on which he was\nworking at the same time and which was finished two years later. Among\na variety of other things, such as his views on society and women\nin particular, the book contains his basic ideas on mind, language,\nontology and epistemology.  \n\nThese ideas are applied to mathematics in his dissertation On the\nFoundations of Mathematics, defended in 1907; it is the general\nphilosophy and not the paradoxes that initiates the development of\nintuitionism (once this had begun, solutions to the paradoxes\nemerged). As did Kant, Brouwer founds mathematics on a pure intuition\nof time (but Brouwer rejects pure intuition of space). \n\nBrouwer holds that mathematics is an essentially languageless\nactivity, and that language can only give descriptions of mathematical\nactivity after the fact. This leads him to deny axiomatic approaches\nany foundational role in mathematics. Also, he construes logic as the\nstudy of patterns in linguistic renditions of mathematical activity,\nand therefore logic is dependent on mathematics (as the study of\npatterns) and not vice versa. It is these considerations that motivate\nhim to introduce the distinction between mathematics and\nmetamathematics (for which he used the term “second order\nmathematics”), which he would explain to Hilbert in conversations\nin 1909 (Brouwer, 1928A2, p. 375n.2). \n\nWith this view in place, Brouwer sets out to reconstruct Cantorian\nset theory. When an attempt (in a draft of the dissertation) at making\nconstructive sense out of Cantor’s second number class (the class of\nall denumerably infinite ordinals) and higher classes of even greater\nordinals fails, he realises that this cannot be done and rejects the\nhigher number classes, leaving only all finite ordinals and an\nunfinished or open-ended collection of denumerably infinite ordinals.\nThus, as a consequence of his philosophical views, he consciously puts\naside part of generally accepted mathematics. Soon he would do the same\nwith a principle of logic, the principle of the excluded middle (PEM),\nbut in the dissertation he still thinks of it as correct but useless,\ninterpreting \\(p \\vee \\neg p\\) as \\(\\neg p \\rightarrow \\neg p\\). \n\nIn “The Unreliability of the Logical Principles” of 1908,\nBrouwer formulates, in general terms, his criticism of PEM: although in\nthe simple form of \\(p \\vee \\neg p\\), the principle will never lead to a contradiction,\nthere are instances of it for which one has, constructively speaking,\nno positive grounds. Brouwer names some. Because they\ndo not in the strict sense refute PEM, they are known as “weak\ncounterexamples”. See the\nsupplement on Weak Counterexamples. \n\nThe innovation that gives intuitionism a much wider range than other\nvarieties of constructive mathematics (including the one in Brouwer’s\ndissertation) are the choice sequences. These are potentially infinite\nsequences of numbers (or other mathematical objects) chosen one after\nthe other by the subject. Choice sequences made their\nfirst appearance as intuitionistically acceptable objects in a book\nreview in 1914; the principle that makes them mathematically\ntractable, the continuity principle, was formulated in Brouwer’s\nlectures notes of 1916. The main use of choice sequences is the\nreconstruction of analysis; points on the continuum (real numbers) are\nidentified with choice sequences satisfying certain conditions. Choice\nsequences are collected together using a device called \n“spread”, which performs a function similar to that of the\nCantorian set in classical analysis, and initially, Brouwer even uses\nthe word “Menge” (“set”) for it. Brouwer\ndevelops a theory of spreads, and a theory of point sets based on it,\nin the two-part paper “Founding Set Theory Independently of the\nPrinciple of the Excluded Middle” (1918/1919). \n\nThe answer to the question in the title of Brouwer’s paper\n“Does Every Real Number Have a Decimal Expansion?” (1921A)\nturns out to be no. Brouwer demonstrates that one can construct choice\nsequences satisfying the Cauchy condition that in their exact\ndevelopment depend on an as yet open problem. No decimal expansion can\nbe constructed until the open problem is solved; on Brouwer’s strict\nconstructivist view, this means that no decimal expansion exists until\nthe open problem is solved. In this sense, one can construct real\nnumbers (i.e., converging choice sequences) that do not yet have a decimal\nexpansion. \n\nIn a lecture in 1923, again using choice sequences and open problems,\nBrouwer devises a general technique, now known as “Brouwerian\ncounterexamples”, to generate weak counterexamples to classical\nprinciples: “On the Significance of the Principle of the\nExcluded Middle in Mathematics” (Brouwer 1924N). \n\nThe basic theorems of intuitionistic analysis — the bar theorem,\nfan theorem, and continuity theorem — are in “On the\nDomains of Definition of Functions” of 1927. The first two are\nstructural theorems on spreads; the third (not to be confused with the\ncontinuity principle for choice sequences) states that every total\nfunction \\([0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\) is continuous and even\nuniformly continuous. The fan theorem is, in fact, a corollary of the\nbar theorem; combined with the continuity principle, which is not\nclassically valid, it yields the continuity theorem, which is not\nclassically valid either. The bar and fan theorems on the other hand\nare classically valid, although the classical and intuitionistic\nproofs for them are not exchangeable. The classical proofs are\nintuitionistically not acceptable because of the way they depend on\nPEM; the intuitionistic proofs are classically not acceptable because\nthey depend on reflection on the structure of mental proofs. In this\nreflection, Brouwer introduced the notion of the “fully\nanalysed” or “canonical” form of a proof, which\nwould be adopted much later by Martin-Löf and by Dummett. In a\nfootnote, Brouwer mentions that such proofs, which he identifies with\nmental objects in the subject’s mind, are often infinite. \n\n“Intuitionist Reflections on Formalism” of 1928 identifies\nand discusses four key differences between formalism and intuitionism,\nall having to do either with the role of PEM or with the relation\nbetween mathematics and language. Brouwer emphasises, as he had done\nin his dissertation, that formalism presupposes contentual mathematics\nat the metalevel. He also here presents his first strong\ncounterexample, a refutation of PEM in the form\n\\(\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}(Px \\vee \\neg Px)\\), by showing that it is false that every\nreal number is either rational or irrational. See the supplement on\n Strong Counterexamples.\n \n\nOf the two lectures held in Vienna in 1928 — “Mathematics,\nScience and Language” (1929A) and “The Structure of the\nContinuum” (1930A) — the first is for the most part of a\nphilosophical nature while the second is more mathematical. In\n“Mathematics, Science and Language”, Brouwer states his\ngeneral views on the relations between the three subjects mentioned in\nthe title, following a genetic approach, and stressing the role of the\nwill. A longer version of this lecture was published as\n“Will, Knowledge and Speech” (1933A2); it contains the\nfirst explicit remarks about a notion that had been present from the\nstart, now known as that of the “ideal(ised) mathematician”\nor “creating subject”. \n\n“Consciousness, Philosophy and Mathematics” (1949C) once\nagain goes through Brouwer’s philosophy of mind and some of its\nconsequences for mathematics. Comparison with Life, Art, and\nMysticism, “Mathematics, Science and Language”, and\n“Volition, Knowledge, Language” reveals that Brouwer’s\ngeneral philosophy over the years developed considerably, but mainly\nin depth. \n\nIn 1949, Brouwer (1949A) publishes the first of a new class of\nstrong counterexamples, a class that differs from Brouwer’s earlier\nstrong counterexample (1928, see above) in that the type of argument,\nwhich now goes by the name of “creating subject argument”,\ninvolves essential reference to the temporal structure of the creating\nsubject’s mathematical activity (Heyting, 1956, chs. III and VIII; van\nAtten, 2003, chs.4 and 5; van Atten, 2018). \n\nBrouwer’s example shows that there is a case where the double negation\nprinciple in the form of\n\\(\\forall x\\in \\mathbb{R}(\\neg \\neg Px \\rightarrow Px)\\), leads to a contradiction (“The\nNon-equivalence of the Constructive and the Negative Order Relation on\nthe Continuum”, in Dutch). The first publication of a strong\ncounterexample in English had to wait till 1954, in “An Example\nof Contradictority in Classical Theory of Functions”\n(1954F). This polemical title should be understood as follows: if one\nkeeps to the letter of the classical theory but in its interpretation\nsubstitutes intuitionistic notions for their classical counterparts,\none arrives at a contradiction. So it is not a counterexample in the\nstrict sense of the word, but rather a non-interpretability result. As\nintuitionistic logic is, formally speaking, part of classical logic,\nand intuitionistic arithmetic is part of classical arithmetic, the\nexistence of strong counterexamples must depend on an essentially\nnon-classical ingredient, and this is of course the choice\nsequences. \n\nThe creating subject argument is, after the earlier introduction of\nchoice sequences and the proof of the bar theorem, a new step in the\nexploitation of the subjective aspects of intuitionism. There is no\nprincipled reason why it should be the last.","contact.mail":"vanattenmark@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
