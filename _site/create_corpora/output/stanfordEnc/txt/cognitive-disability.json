The reason is that\nindividuals with cognitive disabilities have served as test cases in\ndebates about the moral relevance of possessing such intellectual\nattributes as self-consciousness and practical rationality. If a\nsignificant portion of human beings lacks self-consciousness and\npractical rationality, then those attributes cannot by themselves\ndistinguish the way we treat cognitively developed human beings from\nthe way we treat non-human animals and human fetuses. If we cannot\nexperiment on or kill human beings who lack those attributes, then the\nlack of those attributes alone cannot be what justifies animal\nexperimentation or abortion.\n\n\nFor the most part, the philosophers who have considered these claims\nwere not primarily concerned with the treatment or moral status of\ncognitively disabled human beings—they sought to challenge\nexisting practices toward fetuses or animals, or the rationales for\nsuch practices. But those claims have significant practical\nimplications for cognitively disabled human beings. If the\njustification for treating living beings in certain ways does\nrest to some extent on their possession or lack of intellectual\nattributes, then it may be acceptable to treat cognitively disabled\nhuman beings in ways that it would be unacceptable to treat\ncognitively nondisabled humans. This implication, a kind of\nphilosophical blowback from the debates on animal rights and abortion,\nhas become the subject of sustained controversy in applied ethics.\n\n\nPhilosophers who question the moral status of human beings with the\nmost significant cognitive disabilities often compare them to animals\nclaimed to have similar or greater cognitive abilities (McMahan 1996,\n2002, 2009; Singer 1993, 2009; and Wilkinson 2008 in Other Internet\nResources). Some critics find these comparisons unnecessary and\noffensive (e.g., Carlson 2009; Carlson and Kittay 2009). The\nphilosophers who make such comparisons emphasize contrasts like the\nfollowing: Vast numbers of chimpanzees and other “higher”\nprimates are used in painful and often lethal research for the benefit\nof human beings. Although there are strong objections to specific\nprimate research programs and research on specific primates, there is\nbroad agreement that most primate research is acceptable if it has the\npotential to contribute significantly to human health, and if the\nharms and risks to the animal subjects are minimized. In contrast,\ncognitively disabled human beings cannot be enrolled in potentially\nharmful research unless they are likely to benefit, the risk of harm\nis negligible, and their legal representatives consent to their\nparticipation. They enjoy these protections even if they are no better\nable than non-human primates to understand the aims of the research or\nto consent to\n participation.[1]\n \n\nThe debate over the moral status of individuals with the most severe\ncognitive disabilities also raises difficult methodological issues\nconcerning the reliance on intuitions, convictions, and considered\njudgments in assessing moral arguments. Some philosophers would deny\nthat any argument should persuade us to abandon our conviction that it\nwould be terribly wrong to subject a human being cognitively incapable\nof consent to painful and dangerous experimentation of no possible\nbenefit to him (e.g., Kittay 2008). Two philosophers have adapted G.E.\nMoore’s “proof” of the existence of the external world (see\nEntry on\n George Edward Moore)\n to claim that we are more confident of the truth of the proposition\nthat all human beings are morally equal, and morally superior to other\nanimals than of the validity of the arguments denying it (Curtis and\nVehmas, 2016a, 2016b). Other philosophers reject the application of\nMoore’s argument to moral status (Lachlan, 2016; Roberts\nforthcoming); more broadly, they insist that even firm convictions\nabout moral status cannot be immune from critical scrutiny, especially\nif they appear to conflict with other deeply held convictions (McMahan\n2007). Still others deny such convictions any presumptive weight or\nauthority (Singer 2005).\n\n\nFinally, in addressing the moral status of cognitively disabled humans\nin a separate entry, rather than in a general entry on disability, we\nare not endorsing a controversial “exceptionalism” about\ncognitive disabilities—a view that regards them as fundamentally\ndifferent from other kinds of impairment (see\n Related Entries below).\n Our reason for limiting ourselves to cognitive impairment is\ndialectical: there is currently no debate about the moral status of\nindividuals with non-cognitive disabilities. We know of no serious\nphilosopher who argues that people who cannot see, hear, or use their\nlegs, or who experience frequent depression or hallucinations, have\nlower moral status than people without such disabilities. Admittedly,\nsome philosophers claiming to regard humans with physical or\npsychiatric disabilities as having the same moral status as\nnondisabled humans also take positions that other philosophers see as\ninconsistent with a commitment to equal moral status. One notable\nexample is Rawls’ (1971) exclusion of people with physical\ndisabilities from the Original Position on the assumption that they\nare not fully cooperating members of society. Another example is the\ndefense of “quality adjustment” in allocating scarce\nhealthcare resources, which discounts the life-years of people with\ndisabilities to reflect their supposedly lower quality of life\n(Williams 1987). But whether or not these positions are consistent\nwith the recognition of full moral status, their proponents insist\nthat they are; they do not attempt to argue against the equal moral\nstatus of people with physical or (most) psychiatric disabilities. By\ncontrast, the moral status of human beings with cognitive disabilities\nhas become a subject of intense debate among philosophers, applied\nethicists, and disability scholars (for a recent discussion, see\nCarlson and Kittay 2009).\n\n\nWe will proceed as follows. We will first characterize the human\nbeings who are the subject of the debate on moral status—those\nwith what we will call “radical cognitive disabilities.”\nAfter discussing the ways in which humans are classified as\ncognitively disabled, we will describe the narrower category of humans\nwhom the debate concerns. To be clear, this is a group of humans\nstipulated to exist rather than classified by empirical procedures. We\nwill note the difficulty of separating claims about such stipulated\nindividuals from claims that some actual individuals satisfy that\nstipulation. Next, we will characterize the concept of moral status,\ndescribing its structure and function. We will then outline the\nprincipal differences in how that concept is understood, particularly\nits “inclusion criteria”—the criteria for ascribing\nwhat we will call “full moral status,” the status\nattributed to cognitively nondisabled adult human beings. (In calling\nthat moral status “full,” we do not intend to take sides\nin the debates over whether there can be any higher moral status.) We\nwill identify one family of moral-status accounts—those basing\npossession on individual attributes—as the primary, though not\nthe exclusive, source of the challenge addressed in this entry: the\nclaim that some human beings lack full moral status. After outlining\nthose accounts, we will review several ways of meeting the challenge:\n1) basing full moral status on individual attributes shared by a\ngreater proportion of human beings; 2) adopting secondary grounds for\nthe possession of full moral status—by “courtesy” or\nby “proxy”; 3) rejecting individual attribute accounts in\nfavor of accounts that base the full moral status of all human beings\non their species membership or their humanity. \n\nThere is, not surprisingly, disagreement about how to define cognitive\nor intellectual disability. (We will use these terms interchangeably,\nignoring, unless specifically relevant, their apparent differences in\nbreadth and emphasis.) There are competing psychometric and functional\ndefinitions, based respectively on standard deviations from the mean\nscore on intelligence tests and on “significant limitations both\nin intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers\nmany everyday social and practical skills” (American Association\nof Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2011). For this entry,\nwe will consider individuals defined as cognitively disabled in\nfunctional terms, because our interest is in the moral relevance, if\nany, of the absence or substantial limitation of critical cognitive\nfunctions. These limitations are more likely to be captured by\nfunctional than psychometric tests, though as we discuss later, the\nformer as well as the latter may fail to detect significant\nintellectual capacities. We will not assume that, or examine whether,\nindividuals with psychometrically-defined “severe” or\n“profound” intellectual disabilities are functionally\ndisabled in this way. \nAs noted, this entry will focus on human beings with “radical\ncognitive\n disabilities”[2]\n — disabilities in intellectual function and capacity that limit\nor preclude the development of one or more attributes believed to\nconfer full moral status. Among those attributes are the consciousness\nof oneself as a temporally-extended being; practical\nrationality—the capacity to govern one’s actions by\nreasoning about how to act; and the capacity to make and respond to\nmoral demands. (We will often abbreviate the list to\n“self-consciousness or practical rationality” without\nmaking any assumptions about the centrality or relationship of the two\nattributes.) These attributes, as well as others held to be required\nfor full moral status, may be possessed by different subsets of human\nbeings, and the relationship among such attributes is a matter of\nconsiderable dispute. This dispute, however, is best deferred to a\nfuller treatment of the grounds of moral status; we will discuss them\nonly to the extent that they bear on the moral status of human beings\nwith significant cognitive disabilities. \nThe category of “radical cognitive disability” is\nstipulative. We do not start with the assumption that any specific\nhuman being falls into that category, or even that some human beings\ndo. Eva Kittay (2005) has argued that there is no reason to assume\nthat any human beings are radically cognitively disabled, in the sense\nwe are using the term. Jeff McMahan (2009) has countered that the\nexistence of such human beings is very likely: given the continuous\nnature of fetal and infant neurological development, it is very likely\nthat some human beings are radically disabled because their\ndevelopment has ceased or been interrupted at points where they have\nnot yet acquired morally relevant capacities. Even if McMahan’s\n“existence argument” for radical impairment is correct,\nhowever, it does not remove the daunting uncertainty of attributing\nradical cognitive impairment to any actual human being. \nThis uncertainty arises in part from a lack of clarity and consensus\nabout what would count as adequate evidence of self- and\nother-awareness and practical rationality. To resolve that question,\nit is necessary to confront not only interpretive ambiguities in\nmaking inferences about the content of other minds, but conceptual\nissues about what it means to possess critical cognitive functions.\nSimilar issues are raised in the debate about animal consciousness\n(see the Entry on\n animal consciousness),\n but there is also disagreement about whether the kinds of evidence\nadduced for and against the cognitive capacities of animals are\nequally relevant in assessing the cognitive capacities of human beings\n(Kittay 2005; McMahan 2002, 2005, 2008). \nThe primary reason for restricting the entry to radical cognitive\ndisability, like the reason for restricting it to cognitive\ndisability, is dialectical. Few contemporary philosophers would deny\nthat human beings with mild or moderate cognitive disabilities have\nthe attributes required for what we call “full moral\nstatus.” Philosophers who see self-consciousness and practical\nrationality as necessary for that status generally recognize that\nmildly and moderately disabled humans possess those attributes, and\npossess them to the extent necessary to reach the threshold set by\ntheir accounts of full moral status (see\n Sec. 2.1). \nBy stipulating a category of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities, we seek to avoid difficult empirical issues about the\nextent to which individuals classified as having serious cognitive\ndisabilities actually lack the psychological functions held to confer\nmoral status. Even the most direct assessments of these functions may\nfail to recognize atypical, especially nonverbal, forms of cognitive\nfunctioning. And with the possible exception of extreme cases like\nanencephaly, there are formidable difficulties in inferring a lack of\ncognitive capacity from a lack of specific behavior or brain activity.\nAs recent work on intellectually conscious states has revealed (Wannez\net al. 2017, Real et al. 2015), some psychological capacities are\ndifficult to detect neurologically or behaviorally. \nWe recognize that there are objections to the use of stipulation to\nsidestep these difficult empirical issues. Disability scholars insist\nthat philosophers must recognize that the terms they use will\ninevitably be taken to refer to actual human beings, so that they\ncannot stipulate away concerns about hurt and misinterpretation\n(Kittay 2005; Wong 2007). Moreover, the prevalence of individuals who\nactually satisfy their stipulations has relevance to morally\nsignificant policy issues, such as the costs and benefits of more\ninclusive educational practices. Nevertheless, we will rely on the\nstipulation that we have made about radical cognitive disability, in\npart because the assumption that some human beings are radically\ndisabled is shared by many of those who argue for the full\nmoral status of all human beings.  \nWe will discuss only radical cognitive disabilities that are\ncongenital or early-onset. The question of how moral status is\naffected by the loss of important cognitive functions is a\ndistinct one, both for those who believe such functions confer moral\nstatus and those who do not. Concerning the former, the question is\nwhether moral status can survive the loss of the functions on the\nbasis of which it was conferred. For those who deny that moral status\nrequires the possession of those functions, their loss may still raise\nimportant questions about personal identity, and about the\nfirst-person authority of the earlier, nondisabled self over the\nlater, disabled self. The treatment of “once-competent”\nindividuals in minimally conscious states, or with severe dementia,\nthus raises distinct issues about the impact of psychological\ndiscontinuity or loss of mental function on the relationship of human\nindividuals to their past or future selves. There has been a\nprotracted controversy, and a large literature, on these issues\n(Dresser 1995; Dworkin 1994; Stone 2007); they deserve separate\ndiscussion. \n“Moral status” is not part of the shared vocabulary of all\nethical theories. An act utilitarian, for example, has no more use for\nthat concept than for “respect,” “rights,” or\n“inviolability.” For a theory that accorded weight to\nbeings only in proportion to the utility they enjoyed or produced, the\nconcept of moral status would be relevant only in the indirect sense\nthat its use would affect aggregate utility in various ways. For\nexample, the negative utility that might result from denying some\nhuman beings full moral status might support a policy of treating all\nhuman beings as if they had full moral status (see\n Sec. 4).\n On such a theory, the most salient moral property of an individual is\nher capacity to occupy states that can be characterized as\n“good” or “bad,” the most obvious being\npleasure and pain. The possession of such a capacity gives an\nindividual a morally considerable interest in occupying or avoiding\nsuch states. Moral considerability is: 1) continuous, in that the\ndegree of moral considerability that a being possesses varies in\nproportion to the strength, character, and number of its interests;\nand 2) asymmetrical, in the sense that a being might have moral claims\non others without others having moral claims on it. \nWhen non-utilitarian philosophers discuss “moral status”\nof a type of being, they are generally using a more categorical notion\nthan moral considerability. They generally understand moral status as\na threshold concept and a range concept. Beings that fall below a\nminimum level—the threshold—of a status-conferring\nattribute like rationality lack a certain kind of moral status despite\npossessing the attribute to some degree. And all beings that fall\nwithin the “range”—that reach the threshold level of\nthe attribute—have the same moral status regardless of how far\nthey exceed that threshold. (The term “range concept”\ncomes from Rawls; his example is of points within a circle, all of\nwhich are equally “inside” despite varying distances from\nthe circumference.) More controversially, moral status is sometimes\nregarded as symmetrical: a being must be able to have moral claims\nmade on it (and hence be capable of responsibility) as well as being\nable to make moral claims on others. A symmetry condition would\nexclude any human being lacking the capacity to have moral claims made\non them—not only individuals with radical cognitive impairments,\nbut infants and young children as well. \nNot all writers on moral status treat it as both a threshold and range\nconcept. Both features of the concept have been challenged, and the\nconcept itself has been criticized as hierarchical and elitist (Birch\n1993). Several philosophers have argued for treating moral status as a\nmatter of degree, so that a being’s moral status varies\nproportionately with its morally-relevant attributes (Perring 1997;\nDeGrazia 2008). These proposals avoid uncomfortably sharp dichotomies,\nbut they have a revisionary character. Even if commonsense morality\nrecognizes some gradations in moral status, well-established social\npractices such as animal research assume discontinuities. Moreover,\neven if common sense could be reconciled to gradations below the\nthreshold (which would thereby become less of a threshold), it would\nbalk at recognizing gradations above it, thereby abandoning moral\nstatus as a range concept. \nMore comprehensively, Mary Ann Warren has proposed a multi-criterial\naccount of moral status, in which it is neither a range nor a\nthreshold concept. For Warren, the moral status of a being varies with\nthe degree that it possesses the status-conferring attribute (Warren\n 1997).[3]\n But Warren maintains that “full moral status” is both a\nthreshold and a range concept; beings with moral agency enjoy the\nsame, highest moral status regardless of the degree to which they\npossess the attributes needed for moral agency. As noted earlier, we\nwill use the term “full moral status” to refer to the\nmoral status that is generally accorded to cognitively nondisabled\nhuman adults, without assuming that there can be no higher status.\n“Full moral status” is thus roughly synonymous with\n“personhood” as that term is used in debates about whether\nfetuses, or higher primates, are persons. \nThe issue of moral status, and which beings have full moral status,\nhas become important because of its bearing on the rights and\ntreatment of those beings. “Moral status” and “full\nmoral status” are not intended as honorifics; their ascription\nto a being entails that it enjoys rights that other beings, lacking\nthat status, do not. The particular rights entailed by full moral\nstatus may, however, differ on different moral theories. Two theories\nwith the same concept of moral status and the same criteria for\nassigning it (see\n Sec. 2.2)\n may associate full moral status with different rights or rights of\ndifferent strength. One theory might, for example, hold that beings\nwith full moral status may never be used as mere means, whereas\nanother might hold that they may be so used in certain emergencies.\nThere is, though, only partial independence between the formal\ncharacter of and criteria for moral status, on the one hand, and the\nrights entailed by such status, on the other. For example, it would\nseem implausible for a theory to recognize a categorical notion of\nmoral status while rejecting any notion of rights. An account of moral\nstatus need not deny all rights to beings falling below the threshold\nit sets; they will merely lack the same package of rights possessed by\nbeings above that threshold. \nTwo philosophers (Sachs, 2011; Silvers, 2011) have questioned the\nutility of the concept of “moral status.” Sachs argues\nthat claims about moral status are unnecessary and confusing, because\nthe debate is really about the specific attributes needed to justify\nor ground specific rights. Silvers offers an even harsher critique.\nShe charges that proponents of both psychologically and biologically\nbased criteria (see\n Sec. 4,\n Sec. 5, below) neglect gradations in relevant characteristics\nand overlook the potential to display or develop those\ncharacteristics, resulting in unwarranted exclusion. As an\nalternative, Silvers proposes an account of justice that, avoiding\nprior assumptions about capacity, seeks to include as many beings as\npossible within a scheme of social cooperation. \nAlthough moral status claims may well obscure more often than they\nenlighten, they do not, however, merely concern the grounding of\nspecific rights in specific attributes. First, as noted above,\ntheories that share the same criteria for full moral status may differ\nin the rights they associate with that status, and vice-versa.\nMoreover, even if Silvers is correct about the exclusionary tendencies\nof moral status notions, the prior question remains of whether their\nthreshold and range features can be justified. How can the small\ndifferences in morally-relevant attributes that place a being above or\nbelow the threshold ground large differences in the package of rights\nand immunities that being possesses? How can all cognitively normal\nhumans have the same package of rights and immunities despite\ndiffering greatly in the attributes that place them above the\nthreshold? Those who defend the standard concept of moral status need\na moral theory to underwrite its range and threshold features; those\nwho attack it need to deny that any plausible theory could do so. \nThe central question in the debate over the full moral status of human\nbeings with radical cognitive disabilities concerns the type of\nattributes on which moral status is based. Most of those who deny or\nquestion the full moral status of all human beings insist that moral\nstatus must be based exclusively on attributes or properties of the\nindividual; those attributes must be identifiable by a biological or\npsychological inventory of that individual, with no reference to the\nbiological or social environment it inhabits. For example, it would be\npossible to assess an individual’s self-consciousness or\npractical rationality knowing nothing about its fellow creatures\n(although the assessment itself might have to be done by\nself-conscious and practically rational creatures). In contrast, we\ncould not ascertain an individual’s species membership or social\nrelationships without knowing a great deal about the world it\ninhabited. We will call accounts based solely on individual attributes\n“individually-based”; we will label\n“group-based” those accounts based on facts about the\nindividual’s membership in a biological or social group, or her\nrelationship with other members of that group. Those facts may concern\nthe individual’s biological origins, the typical or average\ncharacteristics of a biological or social group to which she belongs,\nor her actual relationships with other individuals. Although some\nindividually-based accounts concern an individual’s capacity or\npotential to form relationships of certain kinds with other\nindividuals, it is that capacity or potential which confers moral\nstatus, not the existence of such relationships. \nThose who insist that moral status must be based on an\nindividual’s own attributes, that it cannot depend on the\naccidents of birth or the vagaries of biological classification, are\nalso likely to insist that an individual’s claims on others\ncannot depend on whether those others happen to be members of the same\nspecies or communities. In this view, full moral status must not only\nbe independent of external circumstances, but must be universally\nrecognized. Although some group-based accounts may require that a\nbeing’s full moral status be universally recognized, others see\nfull moral status as group-relative (see\n Sec. 5.1). \nIn comparing accounts of moral status, it is important to note two\npossible differences between such accounts. First, they may propose\ndifferent conditions as sufficient for full moral status. Some\naccounts, for example, claim that membership in the human species is\nsufficient for that status. Second, they may offer different\nexplanations of how the satisfaction of those conditions grounds or\nwarrants full moral status. For example, even if being a Homo sapiens\nsuffices for possessing full moral status, there may be different\nrationales for why it is sufficient: 1) because it is in the\nnature of Homo sapiens to be rational; 2) because the\nrational nature of the species requires respect for all of its\nmembers, rational or not; or 3) because members of the same species\nhave a duty of partiality to each other, regardless of their\nindividual attributes. Thus, the two accounts ground moral status in\nthe same relational property—membership in the human\nspecies—and they make membership a sufficient condition for full\nmoral status. But they use the fact of species membership differently\nin justifying moral status. They might also associate different rights\nwith full moral status, in accordance with their different ways of\ngrounding it. And, as discussed in\n Sec. 4,\n they may have different implications about who is required to\nrecognize or respect an individual’s status. \nIndividually-based accounts generally take cognitively normal adult\nhuman beings as their paradigm and pick out one or more of their\nattributes as sufficient for the moral status they\n enjoy.[4]\n These accounts identify overlapping clusters of psychological and\ncognitive attributes—self-consciousness, awareness of and\nconcern for oneself as a temporally-extended subject; practical\nrationality, rational agency, or autonomy; moral responsibility; a\ncapacity to recognize other selves and to be motivated to justify\none’s actions to them; the capacity to be held, and hold others,\nmorally accountable. These attributes pick out different subsets of\nhuman beings. Some self-conscious humans, for example, may lack the\ncapacity to be held morally accountable. But individually-based\naccounts may differ less in the range of beings to whom they accord\nfull moral status than in the ways they regard those attributes as\ngrounding that status. \nOne approach holds that psychological attributes confer moral status\nby virtue of the interests to which they give rise. This approach\ntreats psychological attributes as the basis of interests that we have\na prima facie obligation to advance, or at least not to\nthwart—an obligation whose strength varies with the strength and\nother features of those interests. The capacity to feel pain grounds\nan obligation to avoid its infliction; the capacity to anticipate and\ndread as well as feel pain may ground a stronger obligation. But if\nadditional psychological capacities merely increased the strength of\nthe interest, and the corresponding obligation to advance or not\nthwart it, an interest account would not provide a basis for a moral\nstatus threshold (McMahan 2002). \nAn account that accorded interests moral weight in proportion to their\nstrength would not require a notion of moral status, even if beings of\na particular type tended to have stronger interests. Thus,\nphilosophers who account for our differing obligations to beings of\ndifferent species in terms of their unequal interests tend to regard\n“moral status” as an unnecessary or inert notion (Harman,\n2003, 187), or to conclude that all beings with interests (for which\nsentience is often thought necessary) have equal moral status (Rossi,\n2010). This denial of different levels of moral status, however,\nlicenses the unequal treatment of human beings with the most severe\ncognitive impairments if they are assumed to have weaker interests,\nespecially in survival. Thus, it offers cold comfort to defenders of\nthe moral equality of all human beings. \nMore categorical interest-based approaches ground moral status in the\ncapacity to experience oneself as a temporally-extended being whose\nlife can go better or worse (Singer 1993; Tooley 1983) or to value\none’s own existence (Harris 1985; Newson 2007). Individuals\nhaving such capacities can care about and value their future lives in\nways that individuals lacking those capacities cannot, giving them a\nqualitatively weightier interest in those lives (McMahan 2002).\nWhether or not such capacities can account for the threshold and range\nfeatures of full moral status, their adoption as criteria appears to\ndeny that status to human beings with the most significant cognitive\nimpairments. \nA second approach, derived from or inspired by Kant, sees moral status\nin terms of the respect demanded by the possession of one or more\nattributes, such as autonomy or moral responsibility (e.g., Korsgaard\n1996). This approach regards the possession of an autonomous will as\nconferring dignity and demanding respect, so that a being with such a\nwill must not be treated as a mere means, but as an end. This Kantian\nconception of full moral status is often regarded as a paradigm, in\nidentifying an attribute that does not vary\n continuously,[5]\n and whose possession appears to have clear moral implications. The\nthreshold for moral status set by many Kantian accounts is a high one.\nIf those accounts regard the capacity for autonomy as the threshold\nfor full moral status, and if they understand that capacity as\ngrounding moral status in moral responsibility, then since\n“there is nothing for which we would hold human infants or\nseverely cognitively disabled adults morally responsible, it is\nargued, such humans must lack Kantian moral status” (Kain 2009,\n 66).[6]\n Even if humans need not be held morally responsible to enjoy full\nmoral status, many would still lack the capacity for autonomy that\nseems essential on any Kantian account. \nA third approach, associated with contractualism, sees moral status in\nterms of the attributes needed for membership in a moral community, or\nfor participation in relationships of mutual recognition and\n concern.[7]\n It is the capacity for forming such relationships, not their actual\nformation, which grounds full moral status. A cognitively normal human\nbeing would have such status even if he were abandoned on a desert\nisland. This approach, the most clearly symmetrical, treats certain\nattributes as necessary for moral status not because their mere\npossession generates moral obligations, but because they are\nrequisites for the kind of relationships in terms of which the\nproponents of this approach understand moral obligations. This\nrequirement may appear to give cognitive and psychological attributes\na more instrumental role than they are assigned by the second\napproach. It’s not that their mere possession demands respect,\nbut that they enable their possessors to form relationships of which\nmutual respect is an integral part. \nThough relationship-based accounts differ conceptually from\nrespect-based accounts, they differ little in practical terms. They\nwill identify different human beings as having full moral status only\nif humans can have the cognitive or other psychological capacities\nnecessary for respect while lacking the empathy or motivation\nnecessary for membership in a moral community (or vice-versa). For\nexample, a moral-relationship account might exclude psychopaths. But\nso might a respect-based account, if it denied psychopaths autonomy\nbecause they lacked the capacity to be motivated by a sense of duty,\nor more broadly, a capacity to recognize and act on moral reasons (see\nShoemaker 2007). A respect-based account might also exclude\npsychopaths if it attributed their moral deficits to severe\ndisabilities in practical rationality. Relationship-based accounts\nwould, like Kantian ones, appear to set a very high threshold for full\nmoral status. The greater the moral accountability demanded by the\nrelationship, the more difficult it may be to claim that human beings\nwith radical cognitive impairments are capable of participation. \nOne challenge for all of these accounts is to identify an attribute or\nattributes that can explain, or at least be reconciled with, the\nthreshold and range features of the prevailing concept of moral\nstatus. The difficulty presented by a threshold is that it imposes\nmoral discontinuity over psychologically continuous attributes. In\ncontrast to the possession of a soul, for example, practical\nrationality, moral responsibility, and most other individual\nattributes claimed by contemporary accounts to ground moral status,\nappear to come in degrees. Looking at the development of an infant,\nthe acquisition of these attributes appears to be gradual, even if its\npace is uneven. And yet our judgment of moral status appears\ncategorical—an individual either has full moral status or lacks\nit. The categorical character of moral status is also clear above the\nthreshold. We do not think that the more highly intelligent, more\ndeeply self-conscious, or more fully autonomous among us have a higher\nmoral status than the rest, even those near the edge. The challenge of\njustifying this range feature of full moral status is closely related\nto the challenge of justifying the threshold—why should\ndifferences above the threshold be morally insignificant when the\nthreshold itself is so significant? \nIf full moral status is determined by the possession of any of the\ncognitive attributes discussed in the last section, then that status\nwill be enjoyed by some non-human animals and—more\nproblematically—almost certainly lacked by some humans. Most\nproponents of individually-based attribute accounts welcome the\nimplication that we cannot justify existing disparities between our\ntreatment of “higher” animals and cognitively disabled\nhuman beings, and many argue that those disparities are better reduced\nby raising our standards for non-human animals than by lowering them\nfor cognitively disabled humans. \nThe optimal point of convergence … requires that traditional\nbeliefs about animals be more extensively revised than traditional\nviews about the severely retarded. (McMahan 2002, 230) \nBut full convergence, as McMahan recognizes, would have disturbing\nimplications even if it were achieved entirely by upgrading the\ntreatment of nonhuman animals:  \n[T]he preservation of the traditional view [that it is seriously wrong\nto kill an anencephalic infant] will commit us to the conclusion that\nit is seriously wrong to kill an animal that altogether lacks the\ncapacity for consciousness. And this is unacceptable. (2002, 230)  \nConvergence at a significantly lower level would have equally\nunacceptable implications. For example, it would permit the use of\nradically impaired human beings in any research, however harmful, for\nwhich the use of animals with comparable cognitive capacities was\npermitted. Any view about moral status that aspires to reflective\nequilibrium with our deeply held moral convictions must confront the\nabhorrence with which most thoughtful people would regard the\npractical implications of treating humans with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as having even slightly lower moral status than the rest\nof us. \nA variety of approaches seek to address that abhorrence: by\nidentifying criteria for full moral status that include a wider range\nof humanity\n (Sec. 4.1);\n by expanding the ways in which an individual can possess or achieve\nfull moral status without denying the primacy of individual attributes\n (Sec. 4.2);\n and by rejecting individual attribute accounts of moral status\n (Sec. 5). \nSeveral accounts identify attributes, such as the capacity to value or\ncare, that are shared by a greater proportion of human beings than\nself-consciousness, practical rationality, autonomy, or moral\naccountability. These accounts seek to recognize the full and equal\nmoral status of all, or almost all, human beings, including children,\nand of adults with significant cognitive and psychological\ndisabilities. Among the more inclusive criteria proposed are the\ncapacities to communicate, or for minimal communication with other\nhumans (respectively, Berube 1996; Francis and Norman 1978); to value\nor care (Jaworska 1999, 2007); and to give and receive love (Kittay\n1999); to form relationships characterized by reciprocity of care\n(Mullin 2011). Jaworska and Tannenbaum (2016 a, 2016b offer perhaps\nthe most detailed account that grounds moral status in the capacity to\nform morally significant relationships. They maintain that “a\nbeing merits higher moral status” if it has the capacity to\nachieve, through a rearing relationship, “incomplete\nrealizations of activities characteristic of” humans with\ntypical psychological attributes (whom they call “self-standing\npersons” (SSP)) (2016b, 1098). An actual rearing relationship is\nnot necessary, but only beings who can model Characteristic SSP\nactivities have the requisite capacity. This excludes humans\n“capable of rudimentary conscious activity who nonetheless are\nnot yet capable of modeling SSP activities in any form” (2016b,\n1101)—not only early fetuses but children and adults with the\nmost significant cognitive impairments, who will never have that\ncapacity. \nThese accounts are attractive in identifying attributes that may offer\na more intuitively appealing basis for moral status than practical\nrationality or self-awareness, and in reducing, to varying extents,\nthe proportion of humanity excluded from full moral status. But\nbecause they exclude some humans, and may include some non-human\nanimals, they do not fully capture commonsense views about moral\nstatus and will be unacceptable to some philosophers. Moreover, these\nalternative attributes do not resolve, but merely relocate, the\nproblem of accounting for the threshold and range features of full\nmoral status. \nOne attribute—the potential for any other individual\nattribute held to suffice for full moral status—comes much\ncloser to full inclusion (Kumar 2008). But it faces three formidable\nproblems. As Joel Feinberg (1986) famously argued, the fact that\nsomeone has the mere potential for an attribute does not warrant\ntreating him as if he actually possessed it. If potential has moral\nsignificance, it cannot be directly inferred from the moral\nsignificance of that which it actualizes. Further, some human beings\nnever have the potential for any individual attribute held to suffice\nfor full moral status, in any sense of “potential” that\nwould distinguish them from many non-human animals (McMahan 2008,\n91–92). As debates about the moral status of the fetus suggest,\nit is not at all clear when a being has the “potential”\nfor an attribute. The claim that someone has potential is a\ncounterfactual: in some other circumstances, perhaps a later\nlife-stage of the individual, the person would have the attribute.\nThis brings in difficult questions about the scope of such\ncounterfactuals. On a broad enough construal, every living being has\nthe potential to develop the relevant attributes in a sufficiently\ndifferent possible world, and so has full moral\n status.[8]\n  \nMatthew Liao has argued for “the genetic basis for moral\nagency” as a sufficient condition for full moral status that is\nmore plausible and inclusive than a potentiality criterion (Liao\n2010). It accords full moral status to humans who have lost the\npotential for agency, and to radically disabled humans who never had\nsuch potential, in any conventional sense of that term. But it\nincludes these individuals at the cost of including almost all human\nembryos—a cost many would consider excessive. Moreover,\nLiao’s account requires a conceptually difficult, morally\nuncertain distinction between genomes that have and lack “the basis\nfor moral agency” (e.g., Wasserman 2002; McMahan 2002, 2008).\nPotentiality accounts face similar line-drawing problems; the question\nis whether the shift from “potential” to “genetic basis” makes\nthose problems any more tractable. The genetic basis account also\nshares what many would regard as a problem of “over\ninclusiveness”—they confer moral status on early embryos, which\nhave the genetic basis for moral agency, at least as clearly as they\nhave the potential for it. To justify abortion, proponents of either\naccount must rely on a woman’s right to withdraw gestational\naid. \nThese challenges are inherited by two accounts that seek to base moral\nstatus on the possession of a “modal property.” Shelley Kagan\n(2016) and Jonathan Surovell (forthcoming) argue that beings who had,\nor could have had, the psychological capacities of typical human\nbeings are their moral equals. According to both accounts, human\nbeings who lost, or never had, those capacities due to illness or\nimpairment still have the modal property that they could have had\nthem, and this property confers full moral status. That property is\nnot possessed by members of most other species, who could only have\nacquired those capacities in quite distant possible worlds. As\nSurovell puts it, “[d]isability but not species membership is a\nmatter of luck” (21). \nThese accounts face much the same challenge as Liao’s, of\ndetermining whether a given being “could have” developed the\npsychological capacities of human beings when their failure to do so\nresults from genetic differences. They also face the challenge posed\nby members of other species capable of identity-preserving cognitive\nupgrades (DeGrazia, 2016; McMahan, 2016). But perhaps the strongest\nobjection to grounding moral status in modal properties is raised by\nDeGrazia: even if human beings with profound cognitive impairments are\naptly characterized as victims of bad luck, why does their victimhood\nconfer moral status? Surely that status cannot be justified as a\nconsolation prize for a near miss. While this objection does not\ndirectly apply to the genetic-basis account, that account faces the\nquestion of why the biological basis for morally significant\nattributes itself has moral significance. \nA second general way of accommodating the powerful intuitions about\nthe full moral status of all human beings is to recognize alternatives\nto the actual possession of the status-conferring attributes. One\nversion of this approach treats human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as, in effect, capable of acquiring the necessary\nattributes by proxy, through their relationships with other human\nbeings. Thomas Scanlon (1998), for example, affirms the full moral\nstatus of all human beings while basing full moral status (“the\nrequirement of justifiability”) on the individual capacity for\n“judgment-sensitive” attitudes. Although he recognizes\nthat radically-impaired humans lack those attributes, he suggests that\nthey can acquire them vicariously, through trustees: \nThe tie of birth gives us good reason to want to treat [human beings\nlacking the capacity for judgment-sensitive attitudes] “as\nhumans” despite their limited capacities. Because of these\nlimitations, the idea of justifiability to them must be understood\ncounterfactually, in terms of what they could reasonably reject if\nthey were able to understand such a question. This makes the idea of\ntrusteeship appropriate in their case, whether it is appropriate in\nthe case of nonhuman animals or not. It also indicates a basis on\nwhich such a trustee could object to proposed principles. Severely\ndisabled humans have reason to want those things that any human being\nhas reason to want, insofar as those are things that they are capable\nof benefiting from. (185–186) \nScanlon himself may understand trusteeship merely as a way of\nrealizing or respecting the full moral status of human beings with\nradical impairments, a status that is based on “the ties of\nbirth.” Other philosophers, however, suggest that trusteeship\ncan secure full moral status by helping to satisfy criteria that could\nnot otherwise be met. Thus, Francis and Silvers (Francis 2009; Silvers\nand Francis 2009) argue that cognitively normal human beings can\nfunction as “mental prostheses” for radically impaired\nones: \n[A]s a prosthetic arm or leg executes some of the functions of a\nmissing fleshly limb without being confused with or supplanting the\nusual fleshly limb, so, we propose, a trustee’s reasoning and\ncommunicating can execute part or all of a subject’s own\nthinking processes without substituting the trustee’s ideas as\nif it were the subject’s own. (485) \nFor example, trustees can help the subject fashion her own conception\nof the good by carefully eliciting and extrapolating her attitudes and\npreferences. \nFrancis and Silvers do not claim that the moral status of human beings\nwith the most significant cognitive impairments could rest on such\ntrusteeship, or on the potential for it. But it is useful to consider\ntwo challenges facing their proposal, which they acknowledge. The\nfirst is the question of authorship or authenticity: It is not clear\nhow a trustee’s reasoning could be said to “execute”\nall, as opposed to part, of “a subject’s own\nthinking.” It is not clear how the thinking can be the\nsubject’s if it was wholly executed by a trustee (Wasserman and\nMcMahan, 2012). The second challenge, shared by the notion of mental\nprostheses and Scanlon’s notion of the vicarious expression of\njudgment-sensitive attitudes, is the possibility of providing such\nsupport for nonhuman animals—a possibility Scanlon leaves open\nin the above passage. If it could be extended to animals, the\npotential for such representation would ground the full moral status\nof vast numbers of primates and other mammals. To close the\nfloodgates, it would seem necessary to argue that this support was\nless feasible for intelligent animals, even domesticated ones, than it\nwas for radically impaired human beings. Clearly, an argument would be\nneeded that, in Francis and Silvers’ terms, it would be far more\ndifficult to fashion a mental prosthesis for the former. \nA proxy approach also raises the difficult question of how the trustee\ncan acquire the moral and epistemic authority to speak for an\nindividual with radical cognitive disabilities. Legal systems assign\ntrustees or guardians to represent the “best interests” of\nindividuals too immature or impaired to make, or to have made, their\nown judgments. But it is not clear how someone gets\n“appointed” as a trustee for purposes of securing moral\nstatus. Moreover, even those closest and most committed to an\nindividual with radical cognitive impairments may find it hard to\ndiscern his interests, and distinguish them from their own\n“judgment-sensitive” attitudes. \nAnother way of accommodating strong convictions about the full moral\nstatus of all human beings grounds that status in actual relationships\nbetween cognitively normal and radically-disabled human beings.\nBecause of their duties of partiality, the close relatives of\nradically impaired individuals must treat them as if they had full\nmoral status. This could be regarded as an agent-relative status: for\nclose relatives and no one else, radically disabled humans actually\nhave full moral status. But because of the full moral status of those\nclose relatives, other human beings must respect their duty to regard\ntheir disabled kin as full moral equals. They do not, however, have to\nassume that duty themselves. Some proponents of individual-attribute\naccounts—McMahan, for example—appear to take this view. In\ncontrast, some of the group-based accounts in the next section hold\nthat the “tie of birth” requires all cognitively\nnondisabled human beings to accord full moral status to\nradically-impaired human beings, regardless of their relationship. A\nweaker version of this derivative or courtesy position does not claim\nthat a human being with radical cognitive disabilities actually has\nfull moral status even for close family members, merely that they must\ntreat her as if she did. This reduces somewhat (but does not\neliminate) the disparity between family members and third parties, but\nonly by downgrading the moral status of radically-impaired humans even\nfor their most significant others. \nFor some philosophers, either version of this view is unsatisfactory,\nfor two related reasons. First, it is too narrow, since it does not\noffer radically impaired human beings complete moral equality. Only a\nsmall subset of other humans need to treat them as moral equals; the\nrest merely need to respect this special relationship. Second, it is\ntoo contingent—a human with radical cognitive impairments owes\neven his partial equality to the existence of close relationships. If\nhis parents and other relatives abandon him or die, he has only a very\ntenuous claim to being treated by the rest of humanity any better than\na non-human animal with similar attributes. \nWe would suggest yet another “evidentiary” approach to\naccommodating the conviction that every human being has full moral\nstatus, one that calls for the adoption of a strong, even\n“irrebuttable” presumption of full moral status for all\nhuman beings. This approach is based on the difficulty of assessing\nthe cognitive potential of human beings, the powerful tendency to\nunderestimate the capacity and potential of human beings with any\ndegree of cognitive abnormality, and the terrible cost to individuals\nwho warrant but are denied full moral status. This approach can be\nregarded as rule-consequentialist, in requiring that we sometimes\ndisregard our case-specific judgment because of the high probability\nand substantial costs of error. But it may appeal to many who reject\nrule-consequentialism as a general approach. At the same time, this\nrationale for full moral status may seem uncomfortably grudging and\ncontingent. It appears to imply that, with sufficiently accurate\nassessment tools and sufficiently reliable assessors, we could deny\nmoral status to many human beings whom we now are constrained to treat\nas having it. Moreover, their exclusion would represent moral\nprogress. \nSuch a presumption of full moral status for humans with radical\ncognitive disabilities could be given a more robust justification.\nThat justification would treat biological differences, species norms,\nor “ties of birth” not as providing independent grounds\nfor full moral status, but as providing very strong reasons for\npresuming it. Perhaps part of the reason we presume this is epistemic,\nbecause it is so difficult to conclude that individuals who look human\nreally lack human capacities. But that is not the whole explanation.\nWhen cognitively nondisabled humans encounter another being with human\nappearance, they customarily respond to that being in ways they do not\nto non-human animals; they use distinctive gestures, facial\nexpression, touch, speech, and other behavior. Such responses assume a\ncapacity for reciprocal exchange that may not always be present. But\neven when it is not, those responses are not idle gestures. They may\nenable communication, and provoke cognitive and social development,\nthat would otherwise not occur. Family members, friends,\nprofessionals, and scholars who work with people who have cognitive\ndisabilities report that the more time they spend with individuals who\ninitially seemed unable to communicate or respond meaningfully, the\nmore they could discern about their interests, desires, and moods\n(Brown and Gothelf 1996; Goode 1994). Indeed, those people often\ndisplay species-typical preferences in clothing, food, socializing,\nand other activities. In sustained interaction with nondisabled humans\nwho treat them as members of the same moral community, cognitively\ndisabled individuals develop socially and psychologically along the\nlines of other human beings. Treating people with cognitive\ndisabilities as if they had potential for typically human feelings,\ndesires and responses, then, can thus become self-fulfilling. This\napproach offers a pragmatic (and consequentialist) justification for\npresuming that all human beings have full moral status: not merely\nbecause of the terrible costs of mistakenly denying that status, but\nbecause treating fellow human beings as capable of joining our moral\ncommunity makes it more likely that they will be able to do so. \nThis proposal does not claim that such treatment could never be\neffective if directed toward a dolphin or chimpanzee. But we have\nstronger reasons to treat our fellow human beings this way, however\nsignificant their cognitive disabilities. Our shared embodiment and\ngenetic endowment facilitate our treating them as having the capacity\nor potential for typical human interaction and activity, and make it\nlikely that they will be more responsive to our treatment than a\nnon-human animal with similar cognitive abilities. Other intelligent\nbeings, differently embodied than we are, would have the same reasons\nto treat their fellow beings this way. In recognizing such a\nlimited partiality, we do not treat species as having a moral\nsignificance akin to that of families or even nations. Nor, clearly,\ndo we assume that human beings in particular have special moral\nstatus. \nDespite its resolute optimism, this proposal still excludes some human\nbeings from full moral status. It assumes a minimum level of social\nresponsiveness which is almost certainly lacking in human beings with\nanencephaly, and perhaps lacking in human beings with other radical\ncognitive impairments. Yet in its pragmatic justification of a limited\npartiality towards members of the same species, it sets the stage for\nviews that give a more central role to species membership. \nA number of philosophers have argued for the full moral status of all\nhuman beings, without seeking to identify any attribute possessed by\nall humans that would ground that status. These philosophers can be\nroughly divided into two groups. Those in the first group regard\nmembership in the species Homo sapiens as sufficient for full\nmoral status and ground that status in a species-based attribute (See\n Sec. 5.1).\n For some philosophers within this first group, all homo sapiens\nbelong to a kind whose nature or norm it is to possess rationality or\nsimilar attributes\n (Sec. 5.1.1).\n For others, all homo sapiens are connected through “ties of\nbirth” to other human beings\n (Sec. 5.1.2).\n For the former, any being of a kind whose nature it is to be\nrational, etc. has full moral status; for the latter, any human\nrelated by birth to other human beings has full moral status. Although\nthe two approaches pick out the same individual human beings, the way\nin which they ground moral status gives them different implications\nfor the status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments. \nThe former way of grounding moral status gives it a wider\n“writ,” because the individual’s moral status is not\nbased on his relationship to specific others. Rather, it is based on\nthe norm of a group to which she belongs. That norm demands\nrecognition by anyone, whether a member of the group or not, capable\nof recognizing it. If human beings with radical cognitive impairments\nhave full moral status by virtue of belonging to a group with the norm\nof rationality, a rational Martian, no less than a rational human,\nshould recognize the full moral status of humans with those\nimpairments. It might be possible to argue that the morally-relevant\nnorms of a group are not binding on those outside the group, but we\nhave not seen such an argument. \nIn contrast, ties of birth may not bind those lacking the same\nbiological connection; members of other species need not recognize the\nfull moral status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments.\nIn that sense, the moral status of those human beings is not as\n“full” as that of other human beings, since it must be\nrecognized only by other humans. If full moral status is based on\nduties of partiality toward members of the same group, it will be\ngroup-relative, not binding on members of other groups. \nThe second type of group-based account\n (Sec. 5.2)\n acknowledges the moral significance of the group-based attributes\nrelied on by the first type of group-based accounts. But it denies\nthat the full and equal moral status of human beings can be grounded\nin any specific attribute, even indirectly, that can be described in\nmorally neutral terms. These accounts regard “human being”\nas a thick normative concept, grounded in language and social\npractice, that is not necessarily coextensive with the biological\ncategory of “Homo sapiens,” and that has moral content\nthat cannot be derived from any descriptive attribute associated with\nit. The judgment that a being is human and therefore must be treated\nrespectfully does not consist of a value-neutral biological\nclassification and an argument that establishes the moral status of\nbeings so classified. The requirement for certain kinds of treatment,\nand the prohibition of others, is part of the meaning of “human\nbeing” and implicit in the recognition that a given individual\nis a human\n being.[9]\n Proponents of these accounts thus reject the very attempt to identify\na criterial attribute possessed by all beings with the moral status of\ncognitively normal human adults (Diamond 1978; Edwards 1997; Byrne\n2000). These philosophers reject the treatment of cognitively\nnondisabled adults as a paradigm for full moral status, and of\ninfants, young children, and radically cognitively disabled adults as\n“marginal cases” whose moral status needs to be justified\nby\n extension.[10] \nFor both types of group-based accounts, the categorical nature of full\nmoral status is explained by the way in which that status is grounded.\nMembership in the human species, a sufficient condition of that status\nfor accounts of both types, is a categorical rather than a continuous\n“variable” (although there may be some vagueness or\nambiguity due to imprecise or conflicting membership criteria). And\nfor both types of account, the grounding of full moral status is the\nsame for all human beings, regardless of their individual\nattributes. \nOn the first relational approach, some of the properties identified by\nintrinsic-attribute accounts as sufficient for full moral status can\nalso play a distinct role in attaining it. Although, on this view,\nself-consciousness and practical rationality are not necessary for\nfull moral status, they are the norm for human beings. This norm\ncannot be understood statistically; it would not change if most or all\nhumans ceased to be self-conscious or practically rational. Rather,\nthe norm captures what is characteristic of the species. A normal\nattribute is not, however, an essence that each member must possess.\nRather, it is a relational property: each individual has moral status\nas the member of a group for which that attribute is the norm.\nScanlon, for example, claims that the class of those to whom we must\njustify our actions “includes at least those beings who are of a\nkind that is normally capable of judgment-sensitive attitudes”\n(1998, 186). \nSpecies-norm accounts focus on the human species, but they are not\nlimited to humans. Presumably, if we discovered that dolphins or\nMartians were a species with a similar cognitive norm, members of that\nspecies would possess full moral status whether or not they satisfied\nthat norm. We would be bound to recognize (if they could) the full\nmoral status of all dolphins or Martians, and they would be bound to\nrecognize the full moral status of all humans. \nThere may appear to be a tension in grounding full and equal moral\nstatus in norms to which some but not all members conform. Even if the\nnorm of practical rationality gives all group members equal moral\nstatus, it might seem that those members actually possessing that\nattribute would be “more equal” than those lacking it. The\nresponse to this concern, which we discuss in\n Sec. 5.2,\n is that those possessing the attribute have better fortune but no\ngreater moral status. \nNot surprisingly, proponents of intrinsic attribute accounts, such as\nMcMahan, are unsympathetic with the claim that “facts about the\nnature of some individuals could determine how other individuals that\nlack that nature ought to be treated” (McMahan 2008, 85). Like\nother critics, McMahan sees this claim as requiring a kind of\n“moral alchemy” that transmutes factual claims about some\nindividuals into moral demands concerning others. But for those who\nregard humanity as a “thick” concept\n (5.2),\n no alchemy is required. The concept of a human being is a normative\none, conferring rights on all those who fall under it and imposing\nmoral demands on those who understand and apply it. \nA second kind of species-relationship claimed to confer moral status\nis not between the individual human and the species norm, but between\nthe individual human and other human beings, in particular, those who\nare cognitively normal. The claim is that human beings have a reason,\nbased on co-membership in the species, to regard each other as moral\nequals. As Scanlon (1998) asserts, \n[T]he mere fact that a being is ‘of human born’ provides a\nstrong reason for according it the same status as other humans. This\nhas sometimes been characterized as prejudice, called speciesism. But\nit is not prejudice to hold that our own relation to these beings\ngives us reason to accept the requirement that our actions be\njustifiable to them. (185)  \nThis position grounds full moral status in the kinship of all human\nbeings—what used to be called “the family of man.”\nAlthough this kinship currently depends on birth to a human mother, it\nis shared by all human beings and does not vary with degree of\n consanguinity.[11] \nThis approach avoids the questionable notion of a species norm as a\nsource of moral status. But unlike a species-norm account, it requires\nno one but human beings to recognize the full moral status of all\nhumans. On the species norm account, McMahan (2002) observes,  \n[I]ntelligent and morally sensitive Martians would be required to\ntreat severely retarded human beings in the same way they would be\nrequired to treat us. … But if the reason we have to accord the\nseverely retarded the same moral status as other human beings is that\nwe are related to them through the ‘tie of birth,’ then\nMartians would not have this reason. (217)  \nThis is a practically insignificant limitation at present, but an\nexpressively significant one for those who insist that moral status be\nuniversally recognized. \nA defender of a human kinship approach might readily accept this\nlimitation, especially since we and the Martians would still be\nconstrained by the attachments of the cognitively normal members of\nthe other species to their radically impaired relations (as discussed\nin\n Sec. 4.2\n above). But she would still have to defend the claim that\nco-membership in the species established the sort of kinship that\nrequired even this species-relative full moral status. McMahan (2002)\nargues that even if membership in some groups, like nations, could\nconfer full and equal status on its members, membership in the same\nspecies could not: \nUnlike membership in a nation, membership in a species is not a focus\nof collective identity. Being human does not significantly\ndifferentiate us from anything else; it therefore fails to engage our\npride or enhance our sense of identity. Just as no one’s sense\nof identity is enlarged by the recognition that one is an animal\nrather than a plant, so no one’s sense of identity is\nimportantly shaped by an awareness of being human rather than being,\nfor example, a rabbit. (221) \nThe defender of a “ties of birth” account could respond in\ntwo ways. First, she might deny that species identity and pride were\nnecessary to ground the full moral status of species members. Rather,\nthat status was grounded in similarities among human beings, even\nradically disabled ones, that arose from their distinctive embodiment\nand that created a strong sense of fellowship (among those\nself-conscious enough to feel fellowship) overshadowing even vast\ndifferences in mental capacity. These similarities include ways of\nfeeling, communicating, moving, and reacting to and interacting with\nother members of the species. These affinities are refracted by\nculture, members of other species share some of them, and not all\nmembers of the species—even cognitively normal ones—share\nall of them. Nevertheless, they may be a distinctive enough ensemble\nto provide a basis for partiality. Or a defender might argue, as\nBernard Williams (2006) does (see\n Sec. 5.2),\n that species-identity and pride could play a role in human\nfellowship now obscured by the lack of a suitable comparison class.\nAlthough, as Robert Nozick (1974) observed, no contemporary human\nboasts about having an opposable thumb or speaking a language, our\nsense of species pride and identity might crystallize in the presence\nof another advanced species, which would highlight our distinctive\nshared history and achievements. \nStanding alone, however, both responses seem vulnerable to the claim\nthat similarities associated with species membership may explain, but\ncannot justify, the treatment of all other human beings as moral\nequals. Why should a sense of fellowship, however strong, be a source\nof moral status? If our sense of fellowship reflected what mattered\nmorally, why wouldn’t we feel greater fellowship with\nMcMahan’s intelligent, morally sensitive Martian than with a\nhuman infant whose developmental disabilities make him apparently\nunresponsive to other humans? \nOne response is that what justifies intra-species partiality is not\nthe capacity to share but the capacity to benefit. Thus, Gunnarson\n(2008) suggests that members of our own species have a capacity to\nderive unique, intrinsic benefits from their relationship to other\nhuman beings. Reliance on such a capacity may provide an intuitively\nmore appealing basis for full moral status than biologically-based\nsimilarities. But it might still deny full moral status to some\nhumans—not only anencephalic infants but others lacking the\ncapacity to benefit from relations with other humans. Moreover, some\nnon-human animals, especially domesticated ones, may derive immense\nbenefits that are intrinsic and unique to their relationship to humans\n(Townley 2010). And the members of other cognitively advanced species\nmight well benefit in highly specific, possibly unique ways, from\ninteraction with human beings. \nTo explain the moral significance of species co-membership, some\nphilosophers embrace a strongly anthropocentric view, which denies\nthat we can step outside of our humanity to assess the moral status of\nthe world’s inhabitants. On this view, the concept of a human\nbeing is prior to, and inseparable from, that of a\n person.[12]\n As Stephen Mulhall (2002) argues: \n[O]ur concept of a person is an outgrowth or aspect of our concept of\na human being; and that concept is not merely biological but rather a\ncrystallisation of everything we have made of our distinctive species\nnature. To see another as a human being is to see her as a\nfellow-creature—another being whose embodiment embeds her in a\ndistinctive form of common life with language and culture, and whose\nexistence constitutes a particular kind of claim on us. (7) \nThis view, which, following Williams (2006), we will call\n“humanist,” has two variants. The first, per Mulhall, is\nlinguistic or conceptual, influenced by Wittgenstein (1958). We come\nto understand notions like thinking, deciding, and feeling in terms of\nthe behavior of other human beings, and, although we can attribute\nsome of these capacities or states to other beings, it is only by\nextension or analogy (Hanfling 2001). We also learn the appropriate\nways of acting toward fellow human beings in learning the very\nconcept: for example, human beings are to be named, and not eaten even\nwhen they are dead. We do not conclude that human beings must\nbe treated this way; the recognition that they must is already part of\nthe meaning of the concept (Diamond 1978; Gleeson\n 2008).[13]\n This “thick” concept of human being is not a biological\none, and need not have the same extension as the class of Homo\n sapiens[14].\n For some humanists of this type, a newly-created embryo is not a\nhuman being, and it is not part of the meaning of human being that the\nlife of a newly-fertilized embryo must be protected to the same extent\nas the life of a newborn human infant (Crary 2007). But the very fact\nthat other humanists do regard early embryos as human beings\nsuggests the need for an account of how such a deeply-embedded concept\ncan be so vague or debatable at the margins. \nBecause of the role of our language and concepts in our moral\nunderstanding, the justification and criticism of our moral practices\ncan only be internal to them, on humanist accounts. As Byrne\nmaintains, \nreason operates in ethics properly when it functions immanently.\nOffering a sound moral argument in criticism of any one of our moral\npractices would be a matter of drawing upon insight from some other\npart of our moral life. (2000, 70–71) \nThe case against eating animals, for example, cannot be made by citing\nattributes they share with us, but only by exposing tensions or\ncontradictions with our other practices (Diamond 1978). Presumably,\nsimilar but more acute tensions would confront any view of humanity\nthat excluded some biological human beings or denied some of them full\nmoral status, making racism and sexism untenable without placing any\npressure on the concept of humanity itself. \nThe second variant denies the possibility of an impartial basis for\nassessing moral status. To attempt to grade or evaluate the\nworld’s inhabitants in absolute terms is to treat the universe\nas having a point of view—the perspective of a deity or a\nutilitarian Ideal Observer (Williams 2006). Without such a vantage\npoint, human beings can judge the rest of the world only in terms of\ntheir own concerns, values and civilization. Indeed, it is only in\nthose terms that we value those characteristics, like rationality and\nself-consciousness, regarded by individual-attribute theorists as\ncriteria for full moral status (Grau, 2016). Our humanity thus gives\nus an indispensable frame of reference for evaluating the rest of the\nworld. It also grounds a defensible partiality toward each other that\nhas little in common with racism or sexism. Not only do almost all of\nus accept naked appeals to the humanity of another being, as opposed\nto her sex or race, as the basis for action or restraint, we appeal to\nhumanity in rejecting racism and sexism. Naked appeals to race or sex,\nunsupported by claims about morally relevant attributes, are rarely\nmade by the most unapologetic racist or sexist. The “human\nprejudice” is more akin to the affinity and loyalty of\nparticipants in a shared culture. If it is difficult to see “the\nhuman prejudice” this way, it may be because “[h]uman\nbeings do not have to deal with any other creature that, in terms of\nargument, principle, worldview, or whatever, can answer back”\n(Williams 2006, 148). A distinctively human “culture” is\nboth pervasive and barely visible in a world that offers no rivals.\nWilliams does not claim that our commitment to that culture would\nnecessarily trump an appeal to participate in a more advanced\nuniversal community and relinquish cherished but parochial aspects of\nour own culture. Nevertheless, that commitment would give us a morally\ndefensible reason, not just a prejudice, against such\nassimilation. \nHumanist accounts recognize that species norms have moral\nsignificance, but they do not assign them the criterial role they play\nin accounts that ground moral status in relational attributes. In the\npassage from which we quoted earlier, Mulhall regards radically\ndisabled humans as suffering a grave misfortune in lacking\ncharacteristically human capacities: \nWe do not strive (when we do strive) to treat human infants and\nchildren, the senile and the severely disabled as fully human because\nwe mistakenly attribute capacities to them that they lack, or because\nwe are blind to the merely biological significance of a species\nboundary. We do it (when we do) because they are fellow human beings,\nembodied creatures who will come to share, or have already shared, in\nour common life, or whose inability to do so is a result of the shocks\nand ills to which all human flesh and blood is heir—because\nthere but for the grace of God go I. (Mulhall 2002, 7) \nFor a humanist like Mulhall, the capacity to participate in\ndistinctively human forms of life is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor full moral status (as McMahan (2005) appears to assume). That\nstatus is established merely by our recognition of an individual as a\nhuman being, heir to the same “shocks and ills” as we are.\nHuman beings with radical cognitive disabilities suffer “grave\nmisfortune,” not reduced status if they are unable to share in\nthe distinctive forms of our common life in which their embodiment has\n“embedded” them. Non-human animals with similar attributes\nhave lower moral status but suffer no comparable estrangement or loss.\nTheir participation in their own species’ distinctive forms of\nlife—if there are any—does not depend upon, and might well\nbe impaired by, their possession of the cognitive attributes of normal\nadult humans.  \nA critic might concede that we in fact hold these divergent attitudes\ntoward humans and non-human animals but would question their moral\nsignificance: why should we regard the congenital absence of certain\ncapacities as a tragedy for the individual lacking them if\nand only if that individual is human (McMahan 1996)? A humanist would\nrespond that the question itself reveals that the critic simply is not\nclear on the concept of “human being”—a concept that\nincludes the notion of a common life, based on shared embodiment, from\nwhich radically impaired humans are excluded. \nHumanists are wary of grounding the full moral status of\nradically-impaired humans in their relationship to a species-norm like\nrationality. Thus, Byrne (2000) argues that appeal to the rational\nnature of human beings as the basis for respect is too reliant on\nexternal justification and too narrow. It is too reliant on claims\nabout the respect owed to beings that are rational-by-nature, which\nByrne doubts are any more self-evident or plausible than claims about\nthe respect owed human beings. It is too narrow because it ignores\nother aspects of humanity that make the concept of “human\nbeing” so rich and powerful. \nThe position of humanists on the species-relativity of moral status is\nuncertain. Given the critical role they assign to “the\ndistinctive form of common life” of human beings for moral\nrecognition and obligation, it is not obvious that Mulhall or Diamond\nwould require an intelligent Martian to recognize and respect the\nmoral status of cognitively normal human beings, let alone of human\nbeings with radical cognitive impairments. Indeed, it is not clear how\nhumans could confidently impute intelligence to Martians if their\nembodiment was sufficiently different from ours, let alone whether we\ncould regard them as subject to moral obligations of any kind.\nSimilarly, it is not clear whether Mulhall and Diamond would hold that\nhumans were required to treat Martians as moral equals, even if they\ncould attribute intelligence and moral sensitivity to them. The role\nthey assign to distinctively human forms of life raises doubts about\nthe possibility of mutual comprehension, recognition, and respect. \nIn contrast, Williams’ account, and others less wedded to a\nWittgenstinian view of language and concepts, can more readily address\nthe prospect of close encounters with other intelligent beings.\nWilliams himself considers such encounters, and acknowledges the\npossibility of mutual recognition, though he thinks it might be\nreasonably qualified by partiality towards the members of one’s\nown species and its culture. \nThese two humanist accounts leave critical questions about the\nboundaries of the thick concept of “human being.” Does\nthat concept encompass early embryos, or human-like beings produced by\na future synthetic biology? Can we answer such questions in terms of\nthe “fit” of a proposed boundary with the other beliefs\nand practices associated with the concept, or are such questions\ndecided less self-consciously by gradual shifts in our actual\npractices? Without a better sense of how boundary questions can be\nresolved, it is not clear how humanist accounts will meet the\nchallenges of exclusion. \nThere seems to be little prospect for consensus on the moral status of\npeople with the most severe cognitive disabilities. There are sharp\ndisagreements about how, or even whether, the moral status of humans\ncan be grounded, and about the weight to be given our strongest and\nmost considered, moral convictions. Accounts that ground full moral\nstatus in an individual’s possession of psychological attributes\ninevitably exclude some portion of humanity, and appear to have\nimplications for the treatment of the excluded human beings that few\nof us are willing to accept. Those implications are avoided by\naccounts that ground full moral status in our species\nmembership—in the nature of the species or in our biological\nrelationships to other members. Those implications are also avoided by\naccounts that deny the need to ground the moral status of human beings\nin any attribute we or our group possesses. But these ways of avoiding\nexclusion have significant costs. They require a strong partiality\ntoward those with shared biological features, physical appearances, or\norigins, a partiality that conflicts with equally strong, if more\nabstract convictions about the justification for our conduct towards\nothers. And they leave deep uncertainty about the moral constraints on\nour treatment of other living beings and about the boundaries of\nhumanity itself. \nDespite the serious challenges facing both approaches, and the\nformidable obstacles to reaching any sort of consensus, the discussion\nabout the moral status of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities is a central one for applied ethics. It needs to\ncontinue.","contact.mail":"dtwasserm@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2012-07-06","date.changed":"2017-08-11","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-disability/","author1":"David Wasserman","author2":"Adrienne Asch","author1.info":"https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/people/daniel-putnam","entry":"cognitive-disability","body.text":"\n\n\nWhy are cognitive disability and moral status thought to be\nsufficiently connected to warrant a separate entry? The reason is that\nindividuals with cognitive disabilities have served as test cases in\ndebates about the moral relevance of possessing such intellectual\nattributes as self-consciousness and practical rationality. If a\nsignificant portion of human beings lacks self-consciousness and\npractical rationality, then those attributes cannot by themselves\ndistinguish the way we treat cognitively developed human beings from\nthe way we treat non-human animals and human fetuses. If we cannot\nexperiment on or kill human beings who lack those attributes, then the\nlack of those attributes alone cannot be what justifies animal\nexperimentation or abortion.\n\n\nFor the most part, the philosophers who have considered these claims\nwere not primarily concerned with the treatment or moral status of\ncognitively disabled human beings—they sought to challenge\nexisting practices toward fetuses or animals, or the rationales for\nsuch practices. But those claims have significant practical\nimplications for cognitively disabled human beings. If the\njustification for treating living beings in certain ways does\nrest to some extent on their possession or lack of intellectual\nattributes, then it may be acceptable to treat cognitively disabled\nhuman beings in ways that it would be unacceptable to treat\ncognitively nondisabled humans. This implication, a kind of\nphilosophical blowback from the debates on animal rights and abortion,\nhas become the subject of sustained controversy in applied ethics.\n\n\nPhilosophers who question the moral status of human beings with the\nmost significant cognitive disabilities often compare them to animals\nclaimed to have similar or greater cognitive abilities (McMahan 1996,\n2002, 2009; Singer 1993, 2009; and Wilkinson 2008 in Other Internet\nResources). Some critics find these comparisons unnecessary and\noffensive (e.g., Carlson 2009; Carlson and Kittay 2009). The\nphilosophers who make such comparisons emphasize contrasts like the\nfollowing: Vast numbers of chimpanzees and other “higher”\nprimates are used in painful and often lethal research for the benefit\nof human beings. Although there are strong objections to specific\nprimate research programs and research on specific primates, there is\nbroad agreement that most primate research is acceptable if it has the\npotential to contribute significantly to human health, and if the\nharms and risks to the animal subjects are minimized. In contrast,\ncognitively disabled human beings cannot be enrolled in potentially\nharmful research unless they are likely to benefit, the risk of harm\nis negligible, and their legal representatives consent to their\nparticipation. They enjoy these protections even if they are no better\nable than non-human primates to understand the aims of the research or\nto consent to\n participation.[1]\n \n\nThe debate over the moral status of individuals with the most severe\ncognitive disabilities also raises difficult methodological issues\nconcerning the reliance on intuitions, convictions, and considered\njudgments in assessing moral arguments. Some philosophers would deny\nthat any argument should persuade us to abandon our conviction that it\nwould be terribly wrong to subject a human being cognitively incapable\nof consent to painful and dangerous experimentation of no possible\nbenefit to him (e.g., Kittay 2008). Two philosophers have adapted G.E.\nMoore’s “proof” of the existence of the external world (see\nEntry on\n George Edward Moore)\n to claim that we are more confident of the truth of the proposition\nthat all human beings are morally equal, and morally superior to other\nanimals than of the validity of the arguments denying it (Curtis and\nVehmas, 2016a, 2016b). Other philosophers reject the application of\nMoore’s argument to moral status (Lachlan, 2016; Roberts\nforthcoming); more broadly, they insist that even firm convictions\nabout moral status cannot be immune from critical scrutiny, especially\nif they appear to conflict with other deeply held convictions (McMahan\n2007). Still others deny such convictions any presumptive weight or\nauthority (Singer 2005).\n\n\nFinally, in addressing the moral status of cognitively disabled humans\nin a separate entry, rather than in a general entry on disability, we\nare not endorsing a controversial “exceptionalism” about\ncognitive disabilities—a view that regards them as fundamentally\ndifferent from other kinds of impairment (see\n Related Entries below).\n Our reason for limiting ourselves to cognitive impairment is\ndialectical: there is currently no debate about the moral status of\nindividuals with non-cognitive disabilities. We know of no serious\nphilosopher who argues that people who cannot see, hear, or use their\nlegs, or who experience frequent depression or hallucinations, have\nlower moral status than people without such disabilities. Admittedly,\nsome philosophers claiming to regard humans with physical or\npsychiatric disabilities as having the same moral status as\nnondisabled humans also take positions that other philosophers see as\ninconsistent with a commitment to equal moral status. One notable\nexample is Rawls’ (1971) exclusion of people with physical\ndisabilities from the Original Position on the assumption that they\nare not fully cooperating members of society. Another example is the\ndefense of “quality adjustment” in allocating scarce\nhealthcare resources, which discounts the life-years of people with\ndisabilities to reflect their supposedly lower quality of life\n(Williams 1987). But whether or not these positions are consistent\nwith the recognition of full moral status, their proponents insist\nthat they are; they do not attempt to argue against the equal moral\nstatus of people with physical or (most) psychiatric disabilities. By\ncontrast, the moral status of human beings with cognitive disabilities\nhas become a subject of intense debate among philosophers, applied\nethicists, and disability scholars (for a recent discussion, see\nCarlson and Kittay 2009).\n\n\nWe will proceed as follows. We will first characterize the human\nbeings who are the subject of the debate on moral status—those\nwith what we will call “radical cognitive disabilities.”\nAfter discussing the ways in which humans are classified as\ncognitively disabled, we will describe the narrower category of humans\nwhom the debate concerns. To be clear, this is a group of humans\nstipulated to exist rather than classified by empirical procedures. We\nwill note the difficulty of separating claims about such stipulated\nindividuals from claims that some actual individuals satisfy that\nstipulation. Next, we will characterize the concept of moral status,\ndescribing its structure and function. We will then outline the\nprincipal differences in how that concept is understood, particularly\nits “inclusion criteria”—the criteria for ascribing\nwhat we will call “full moral status,” the status\nattributed to cognitively nondisabled adult human beings. (In calling\nthat moral status “full,” we do not intend to take sides\nin the debates over whether there can be any higher moral status.) We\nwill identify one family of moral-status accounts—those basing\npossession on individual attributes—as the primary, though not\nthe exclusive, source of the challenge addressed in this entry: the\nclaim that some human beings lack full moral status. After outlining\nthose accounts, we will review several ways of meeting the challenge:\n1) basing full moral status on individual attributes shared by a\ngreater proportion of human beings; 2) adopting secondary grounds for\nthe possession of full moral status—by “courtesy” or\nby “proxy”; 3) rejecting individual attribute accounts in\nfavor of accounts that base the full moral status of all human beings\non their species membership or their humanity. \n\nThere is, not surprisingly, disagreement about how to define cognitive\nor intellectual disability. (We will use these terms interchangeably,\nignoring, unless specifically relevant, their apparent differences in\nbreadth and emphasis.) There are competing psychometric and functional\ndefinitions, based respectively on standard deviations from the mean\nscore on intelligence tests and on “significant limitations both\nin intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers\nmany everyday social and practical skills” (American Association\nof Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2011). For this entry,\nwe will consider individuals defined as cognitively disabled in\nfunctional terms, because our interest is in the moral relevance, if\nany, of the absence or substantial limitation of critical cognitive\nfunctions. These limitations are more likely to be captured by\nfunctional than psychometric tests, though as we discuss later, the\nformer as well as the latter may fail to detect significant\nintellectual capacities. We will not assume that, or examine whether,\nindividuals with psychometrically-defined “severe” or\n“profound” intellectual disabilities are functionally\ndisabled in this way. \nAs noted, this entry will focus on human beings with “radical\ncognitive\n disabilities”[2]\n — disabilities in intellectual function and capacity that limit\nor preclude the development of one or more attributes believed to\nconfer full moral status. Among those attributes are the consciousness\nof oneself as a temporally-extended being; practical\nrationality—the capacity to govern one’s actions by\nreasoning about how to act; and the capacity to make and respond to\nmoral demands. (We will often abbreviate the list to\n“self-consciousness or practical rationality” without\nmaking any assumptions about the centrality or relationship of the two\nattributes.) These attributes, as well as others held to be required\nfor full moral status, may be possessed by different subsets of human\nbeings, and the relationship among such attributes is a matter of\nconsiderable dispute. This dispute, however, is best deferred to a\nfuller treatment of the grounds of moral status; we will discuss them\nonly to the extent that they bear on the moral status of human beings\nwith significant cognitive disabilities. \nThe category of “radical cognitive disability” is\nstipulative. We do not start with the assumption that any specific\nhuman being falls into that category, or even that some human beings\ndo. Eva Kittay (2005) has argued that there is no reason to assume\nthat any human beings are radically cognitively disabled, in the sense\nwe are using the term. Jeff McMahan (2009) has countered that the\nexistence of such human beings is very likely: given the continuous\nnature of fetal and infant neurological development, it is very likely\nthat some human beings are radically disabled because their\ndevelopment has ceased or been interrupted at points where they have\nnot yet acquired morally relevant capacities. Even if McMahan’s\n“existence argument” for radical impairment is correct,\nhowever, it does not remove the daunting uncertainty of attributing\nradical cognitive impairment to any actual human being. \nThis uncertainty arises in part from a lack of clarity and consensus\nabout what would count as adequate evidence of self- and\nother-awareness and practical rationality. To resolve that question,\nit is necessary to confront not only interpretive ambiguities in\nmaking inferences about the content of other minds, but conceptual\nissues about what it means to possess critical cognitive functions.\nSimilar issues are raised in the debate about animal consciousness\n(see the Entry on\n animal consciousness),\n but there is also disagreement about whether the kinds of evidence\nadduced for and against the cognitive capacities of animals are\nequally relevant in assessing the cognitive capacities of human beings\n(Kittay 2005; McMahan 2002, 2005, 2008). \nThe primary reason for restricting the entry to radical cognitive\ndisability, like the reason for restricting it to cognitive\ndisability, is dialectical. Few contemporary philosophers would deny\nthat human beings with mild or moderate cognitive disabilities have\nthe attributes required for what we call “full moral\nstatus.” Philosophers who see self-consciousness and practical\nrationality as necessary for that status generally recognize that\nmildly and moderately disabled humans possess those attributes, and\npossess them to the extent necessary to reach the threshold set by\ntheir accounts of full moral status (see\n Sec. 2.1). \nBy stipulating a category of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities, we seek to avoid difficult empirical issues about the\nextent to which individuals classified as having serious cognitive\ndisabilities actually lack the psychological functions held to confer\nmoral status. Even the most direct assessments of these functions may\nfail to recognize atypical, especially nonverbal, forms of cognitive\nfunctioning. And with the possible exception of extreme cases like\nanencephaly, there are formidable difficulties in inferring a lack of\ncognitive capacity from a lack of specific behavior or brain activity.\nAs recent work on intellectually conscious states has revealed (Wannez\net al. 2017, Real et al. 2015), some psychological capacities are\ndifficult to detect neurologically or behaviorally. \nWe recognize that there are objections to the use of stipulation to\nsidestep these difficult empirical issues. Disability scholars insist\nthat philosophers must recognize that the terms they use will\ninevitably be taken to refer to actual human beings, so that they\ncannot stipulate away concerns about hurt and misinterpretation\n(Kittay 2005; Wong 2007). Moreover, the prevalence of individuals who\nactually satisfy their stipulations has relevance to morally\nsignificant policy issues, such as the costs and benefits of more\ninclusive educational practices. Nevertheless, we will rely on the\nstipulation that we have made about radical cognitive disability, in\npart because the assumption that some human beings are radically\ndisabled is shared by many of those who argue for the full\nmoral status of all human beings.  \nWe will discuss only radical cognitive disabilities that are\ncongenital or early-onset. The question of how moral status is\naffected by the loss of important cognitive functions is a\ndistinct one, both for those who believe such functions confer moral\nstatus and those who do not. Concerning the former, the question is\nwhether moral status can survive the loss of the functions on the\nbasis of which it was conferred. For those who deny that moral status\nrequires the possession of those functions, their loss may still raise\nimportant questions about personal identity, and about the\nfirst-person authority of the earlier, nondisabled self over the\nlater, disabled self. The treatment of “once-competent”\nindividuals in minimally conscious states, or with severe dementia,\nthus raises distinct issues about the impact of psychological\ndiscontinuity or loss of mental function on the relationship of human\nindividuals to their past or future selves. There has been a\nprotracted controversy, and a large literature, on these issues\n(Dresser 1995; Dworkin 1994; Stone 2007); they deserve separate\ndiscussion. \n“Moral status” is not part of the shared vocabulary of all\nethical theories. An act utilitarian, for example, has no more use for\nthat concept than for “respect,” “rights,” or\n“inviolability.” For a theory that accorded weight to\nbeings only in proportion to the utility they enjoyed or produced, the\nconcept of moral status would be relevant only in the indirect sense\nthat its use would affect aggregate utility in various ways. For\nexample, the negative utility that might result from denying some\nhuman beings full moral status might support a policy of treating all\nhuman beings as if they had full moral status (see\n Sec. 4).\n On such a theory, the most salient moral property of an individual is\nher capacity to occupy states that can be characterized as\n“good” or “bad,” the most obvious being\npleasure and pain. The possession of such a capacity gives an\nindividual a morally considerable interest in occupying or avoiding\nsuch states. Moral considerability is: 1) continuous, in that the\ndegree of moral considerability that a being possesses varies in\nproportion to the strength, character, and number of its interests;\nand 2) asymmetrical, in the sense that a being might have moral claims\non others without others having moral claims on it. \nWhen non-utilitarian philosophers discuss “moral status”\nof a type of being, they are generally using a more categorical notion\nthan moral considerability. They generally understand moral status as\na threshold concept and a range concept. Beings that fall below a\nminimum level—the threshold—of a status-conferring\nattribute like rationality lack a certain kind of moral status despite\npossessing the attribute to some degree. And all beings that fall\nwithin the “range”—that reach the threshold level of\nthe attribute—have the same moral status regardless of how far\nthey exceed that threshold. (The term “range concept”\ncomes from Rawls; his example is of points within a circle, all of\nwhich are equally “inside” despite varying distances from\nthe circumference.) More controversially, moral status is sometimes\nregarded as symmetrical: a being must be able to have moral claims\nmade on it (and hence be capable of responsibility) as well as being\nable to make moral claims on others. A symmetry condition would\nexclude any human being lacking the capacity to have moral claims made\non them—not only individuals with radical cognitive impairments,\nbut infants and young children as well. \nNot all writers on moral status treat it as both a threshold and range\nconcept. Both features of the concept have been challenged, and the\nconcept itself has been criticized as hierarchical and elitist (Birch\n1993). Several philosophers have argued for treating moral status as a\nmatter of degree, so that a being’s moral status varies\nproportionately with its morally-relevant attributes (Perring 1997;\nDeGrazia 2008). These proposals avoid uncomfortably sharp dichotomies,\nbut they have a revisionary character. Even if commonsense morality\nrecognizes some gradations in moral status, well-established social\npractices such as animal research assume discontinuities. Moreover,\neven if common sense could be reconciled to gradations below the\nthreshold (which would thereby become less of a threshold), it would\nbalk at recognizing gradations above it, thereby abandoning moral\nstatus as a range concept. \nMore comprehensively, Mary Ann Warren has proposed a multi-criterial\naccount of moral status, in which it is neither a range nor a\nthreshold concept. For Warren, the moral status of a being varies with\nthe degree that it possesses the status-conferring attribute (Warren\n 1997).[3]\n But Warren maintains that “full moral status” is both a\nthreshold and a range concept; beings with moral agency enjoy the\nsame, highest moral status regardless of the degree to which they\npossess the attributes needed for moral agency. As noted earlier, we\nwill use the term “full moral status” to refer to the\nmoral status that is generally accorded to cognitively nondisabled\nhuman adults, without assuming that there can be no higher status.\n“Full moral status” is thus roughly synonymous with\n“personhood” as that term is used in debates about whether\nfetuses, or higher primates, are persons. \nThe issue of moral status, and which beings have full moral status,\nhas become important because of its bearing on the rights and\ntreatment of those beings. “Moral status” and “full\nmoral status” are not intended as honorifics; their ascription\nto a being entails that it enjoys rights that other beings, lacking\nthat status, do not. The particular rights entailed by full moral\nstatus may, however, differ on different moral theories. Two theories\nwith the same concept of moral status and the same criteria for\nassigning it (see\n Sec. 2.2)\n may associate full moral status with different rights or rights of\ndifferent strength. One theory might, for example, hold that beings\nwith full moral status may never be used as mere means, whereas\nanother might hold that they may be so used in certain emergencies.\nThere is, though, only partial independence between the formal\ncharacter of and criteria for moral status, on the one hand, and the\nrights entailed by such status, on the other. For example, it would\nseem implausible for a theory to recognize a categorical notion of\nmoral status while rejecting any notion of rights. An account of moral\nstatus need not deny all rights to beings falling below the threshold\nit sets; they will merely lack the same package of rights possessed by\nbeings above that threshold. \nTwo philosophers (Sachs, 2011; Silvers, 2011) have questioned the\nutility of the concept of “moral status.” Sachs argues\nthat claims about moral status are unnecessary and confusing, because\nthe debate is really about the specific attributes needed to justify\nor ground specific rights. Silvers offers an even harsher critique.\nShe charges that proponents of both psychologically and biologically\nbased criteria (see\n Sec. 4,\n Sec. 5, below) neglect gradations in relevant characteristics\nand overlook the potential to display or develop those\ncharacteristics, resulting in unwarranted exclusion. As an\nalternative, Silvers proposes an account of justice that, avoiding\nprior assumptions about capacity, seeks to include as many beings as\npossible within a scheme of social cooperation. \nAlthough moral status claims may well obscure more often than they\nenlighten, they do not, however, merely concern the grounding of\nspecific rights in specific attributes. First, as noted above,\ntheories that share the same criteria for full moral status may differ\nin the rights they associate with that status, and vice-versa.\nMoreover, even if Silvers is correct about the exclusionary tendencies\nof moral status notions, the prior question remains of whether their\nthreshold and range features can be justified. How can the small\ndifferences in morally-relevant attributes that place a being above or\nbelow the threshold ground large differences in the package of rights\nand immunities that being possesses? How can all cognitively normal\nhumans have the same package of rights and immunities despite\ndiffering greatly in the attributes that place them above the\nthreshold? Those who defend the standard concept of moral status need\na moral theory to underwrite its range and threshold features; those\nwho attack it need to deny that any plausible theory could do so. \nThe central question in the debate over the full moral status of human\nbeings with radical cognitive disabilities concerns the type of\nattributes on which moral status is based. Most of those who deny or\nquestion the full moral status of all human beings insist that moral\nstatus must be based exclusively on attributes or properties of the\nindividual; those attributes must be identifiable by a biological or\npsychological inventory of that individual, with no reference to the\nbiological or social environment it inhabits. For example, it would be\npossible to assess an individual’s self-consciousness or\npractical rationality knowing nothing about its fellow creatures\n(although the assessment itself might have to be done by\nself-conscious and practically rational creatures). In contrast, we\ncould not ascertain an individual’s species membership or social\nrelationships without knowing a great deal about the world it\ninhabited. We will call accounts based solely on individual attributes\n“individually-based”; we will label\n“group-based” those accounts based on facts about the\nindividual’s membership in a biological or social group, or her\nrelationship with other members of that group. Those facts may concern\nthe individual’s biological origins, the typical or average\ncharacteristics of a biological or social group to which she belongs,\nor her actual relationships with other individuals. Although some\nindividually-based accounts concern an individual’s capacity or\npotential to form relationships of certain kinds with other\nindividuals, it is that capacity or potential which confers moral\nstatus, not the existence of such relationships. \nThose who insist that moral status must be based on an\nindividual’s own attributes, that it cannot depend on the\naccidents of birth or the vagaries of biological classification, are\nalso likely to insist that an individual’s claims on others\ncannot depend on whether those others happen to be members of the same\nspecies or communities. In this view, full moral status must not only\nbe independent of external circumstances, but must be universally\nrecognized. Although some group-based accounts may require that a\nbeing’s full moral status be universally recognized, others see\nfull moral status as group-relative (see\n Sec. 5.1). \nIn comparing accounts of moral status, it is important to note two\npossible differences between such accounts. First, they may propose\ndifferent conditions as sufficient for full moral status. Some\naccounts, for example, claim that membership in the human species is\nsufficient for that status. Second, they may offer different\nexplanations of how the satisfaction of those conditions grounds or\nwarrants full moral status. For example, even if being a Homo sapiens\nsuffices for possessing full moral status, there may be different\nrationales for why it is sufficient: 1) because it is in the\nnature of Homo sapiens to be rational; 2) because the\nrational nature of the species requires respect for all of its\nmembers, rational or not; or 3) because members of the same species\nhave a duty of partiality to each other, regardless of their\nindividual attributes. Thus, the two accounts ground moral status in\nthe same relational property—membership in the human\nspecies—and they make membership a sufficient condition for full\nmoral status. But they use the fact of species membership differently\nin justifying moral status. They might also associate different rights\nwith full moral status, in accordance with their different ways of\ngrounding it. And, as discussed in\n Sec. 4,\n they may have different implications about who is required to\nrecognize or respect an individual’s status. \nIndividually-based accounts generally take cognitively normal adult\nhuman beings as their paradigm and pick out one or more of their\nattributes as sufficient for the moral status they\n enjoy.[4]\n These accounts identify overlapping clusters of psychological and\ncognitive attributes—self-consciousness, awareness of and\nconcern for oneself as a temporally-extended subject; practical\nrationality, rational agency, or autonomy; moral responsibility; a\ncapacity to recognize other selves and to be motivated to justify\none’s actions to them; the capacity to be held, and hold others,\nmorally accountable. These attributes pick out different subsets of\nhuman beings. Some self-conscious humans, for example, may lack the\ncapacity to be held morally accountable. But individually-based\naccounts may differ less in the range of beings to whom they accord\nfull moral status than in the ways they regard those attributes as\ngrounding that status. \nOne approach holds that psychological attributes confer moral status\nby virtue of the interests to which they give rise. This approach\ntreats psychological attributes as the basis of interests that we have\na prima facie obligation to advance, or at least not to\nthwart—an obligation whose strength varies with the strength and\nother features of those interests. The capacity to feel pain grounds\nan obligation to avoid its infliction; the capacity to anticipate and\ndread as well as feel pain may ground a stronger obligation. But if\nadditional psychological capacities merely increased the strength of\nthe interest, and the corresponding obligation to advance or not\nthwart it, an interest account would not provide a basis for a moral\nstatus threshold (McMahan 2002). \nAn account that accorded interests moral weight in proportion to their\nstrength would not require a notion of moral status, even if beings of\na particular type tended to have stronger interests. Thus,\nphilosophers who account for our differing obligations to beings of\ndifferent species in terms of their unequal interests tend to regard\n“moral status” as an unnecessary or inert notion (Harman,\n2003, 187), or to conclude that all beings with interests (for which\nsentience is often thought necessary) have equal moral status (Rossi,\n2010). This denial of different levels of moral status, however,\nlicenses the unequal treatment of human beings with the most severe\ncognitive impairments if they are assumed to have weaker interests,\nespecially in survival. Thus, it offers cold comfort to defenders of\nthe moral equality of all human beings. \nMore categorical interest-based approaches ground moral status in the\ncapacity to experience oneself as a temporally-extended being whose\nlife can go better or worse (Singer 1993; Tooley 1983) or to value\none’s own existence (Harris 1985; Newson 2007). Individuals\nhaving such capacities can care about and value their future lives in\nways that individuals lacking those capacities cannot, giving them a\nqualitatively weightier interest in those lives (McMahan 2002).\nWhether or not such capacities can account for the threshold and range\nfeatures of full moral status, their adoption as criteria appears to\ndeny that status to human beings with the most significant cognitive\nimpairments. \nA second approach, derived from or inspired by Kant, sees moral status\nin terms of the respect demanded by the possession of one or more\nattributes, such as autonomy or moral responsibility (e.g., Korsgaard\n1996). This approach regards the possession of an autonomous will as\nconferring dignity and demanding respect, so that a being with such a\nwill must not be treated as a mere means, but as an end. This Kantian\nconception of full moral status is often regarded as a paradigm, in\nidentifying an attribute that does not vary\n continuously,[5]\n and whose possession appears to have clear moral implications. The\nthreshold for moral status set by many Kantian accounts is a high one.\nIf those accounts regard the capacity for autonomy as the threshold\nfor full moral status, and if they understand that capacity as\ngrounding moral status in moral responsibility, then since\n“there is nothing for which we would hold human infants or\nseverely cognitively disabled adults morally responsible, it is\nargued, such humans must lack Kantian moral status” (Kain 2009,\n 66).[6]\n Even if humans need not be held morally responsible to enjoy full\nmoral status, many would still lack the capacity for autonomy that\nseems essential on any Kantian account. \nA third approach, associated with contractualism, sees moral status in\nterms of the attributes needed for membership in a moral community, or\nfor participation in relationships of mutual recognition and\n concern.[7]\n It is the capacity for forming such relationships, not their actual\nformation, which grounds full moral status. A cognitively normal human\nbeing would have such status even if he were abandoned on a desert\nisland. This approach, the most clearly symmetrical, treats certain\nattributes as necessary for moral status not because their mere\npossession generates moral obligations, but because they are\nrequisites for the kind of relationships in terms of which the\nproponents of this approach understand moral obligations. This\nrequirement may appear to give cognitive and psychological attributes\na more instrumental role than they are assigned by the second\napproach. It’s not that their mere possession demands respect,\nbut that they enable their possessors to form relationships of which\nmutual respect is an integral part. \nThough relationship-based accounts differ conceptually from\nrespect-based accounts, they differ little in practical terms. They\nwill identify different human beings as having full moral status only\nif humans can have the cognitive or other psychological capacities\nnecessary for respect while lacking the empathy or motivation\nnecessary for membership in a moral community (or vice-versa). For\nexample, a moral-relationship account might exclude psychopaths. But\nso might a respect-based account, if it denied psychopaths autonomy\nbecause they lacked the capacity to be motivated by a sense of duty,\nor more broadly, a capacity to recognize and act on moral reasons (see\nShoemaker 2007). A respect-based account might also exclude\npsychopaths if it attributed their moral deficits to severe\ndisabilities in practical rationality. Relationship-based accounts\nwould, like Kantian ones, appear to set a very high threshold for full\nmoral status. The greater the moral accountability demanded by the\nrelationship, the more difficult it may be to claim that human beings\nwith radical cognitive impairments are capable of participation. \nOne challenge for all of these accounts is to identify an attribute or\nattributes that can explain, or at least be reconciled with, the\nthreshold and range features of the prevailing concept of moral\nstatus. The difficulty presented by a threshold is that it imposes\nmoral discontinuity over psychologically continuous attributes. In\ncontrast to the possession of a soul, for example, practical\nrationality, moral responsibility, and most other individual\nattributes claimed by contemporary accounts to ground moral status,\nappear to come in degrees. Looking at the development of an infant,\nthe acquisition of these attributes appears to be gradual, even if its\npace is uneven. And yet our judgment of moral status appears\ncategorical—an individual either has full moral status or lacks\nit. The categorical character of moral status is also clear above the\nthreshold. We do not think that the more highly intelligent, more\ndeeply self-conscious, or more fully autonomous among us have a higher\nmoral status than the rest, even those near the edge. The challenge of\njustifying this range feature of full moral status is closely related\nto the challenge of justifying the threshold—why should\ndifferences above the threshold be morally insignificant when the\nthreshold itself is so significant? \nIf full moral status is determined by the possession of any of the\ncognitive attributes discussed in the last section, then that status\nwill be enjoyed by some non-human animals and—more\nproblematically—almost certainly lacked by some humans. Most\nproponents of individually-based attribute accounts welcome the\nimplication that we cannot justify existing disparities between our\ntreatment of “higher” animals and cognitively disabled\nhuman beings, and many argue that those disparities are better reduced\nby raising our standards for non-human animals than by lowering them\nfor cognitively disabled humans. \nThe optimal point of convergence … requires that traditional\nbeliefs about animals be more extensively revised than traditional\nviews about the severely retarded. (McMahan 2002, 230) \nBut full convergence, as McMahan recognizes, would have disturbing\nimplications even if it were achieved entirely by upgrading the\ntreatment of nonhuman animals:  \n[T]he preservation of the traditional view [that it is seriously wrong\nto kill an anencephalic infant] will commit us to the conclusion that\nit is seriously wrong to kill an animal that altogether lacks the\ncapacity for consciousness. And this is unacceptable. (2002, 230)  \nConvergence at a significantly lower level would have equally\nunacceptable implications. For example, it would permit the use of\nradically impaired human beings in any research, however harmful, for\nwhich the use of animals with comparable cognitive capacities was\npermitted. Any view about moral status that aspires to reflective\nequilibrium with our deeply held moral convictions must confront the\nabhorrence with which most thoughtful people would regard the\npractical implications of treating humans with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as having even slightly lower moral status than the rest\nof us. \nA variety of approaches seek to address that abhorrence: by\nidentifying criteria for full moral status that include a wider range\nof humanity\n (Sec. 4.1);\n by expanding the ways in which an individual can possess or achieve\nfull moral status without denying the primacy of individual attributes\n (Sec. 4.2);\n and by rejecting individual attribute accounts of moral status\n (Sec. 5). \nSeveral accounts identify attributes, such as the capacity to value or\ncare, that are shared by a greater proportion of human beings than\nself-consciousness, practical rationality, autonomy, or moral\naccountability. These accounts seek to recognize the full and equal\nmoral status of all, or almost all, human beings, including children,\nand of adults with significant cognitive and psychological\ndisabilities. Among the more inclusive criteria proposed are the\ncapacities to communicate, or for minimal communication with other\nhumans (respectively, Berube 1996; Francis and Norman 1978); to value\nor care (Jaworska 1999, 2007); and to give and receive love (Kittay\n1999); to form relationships characterized by reciprocity of care\n(Mullin 2011). Jaworska and Tannenbaum (2016 a, 2016b offer perhaps\nthe most detailed account that grounds moral status in the capacity to\nform morally significant relationships. They maintain that “a\nbeing merits higher moral status” if it has the capacity to\nachieve, through a rearing relationship, “incomplete\nrealizations of activities characteristic of” humans with\ntypical psychological attributes (whom they call “self-standing\npersons” (SSP)) (2016b, 1098). An actual rearing relationship is\nnot necessary, but only beings who can model Characteristic SSP\nactivities have the requisite capacity. This excludes humans\n“capable of rudimentary conscious activity who nonetheless are\nnot yet capable of modeling SSP activities in any form” (2016b,\n1101)—not only early fetuses but children and adults with the\nmost significant cognitive impairments, who will never have that\ncapacity. \nThese accounts are attractive in identifying attributes that may offer\na more intuitively appealing basis for moral status than practical\nrationality or self-awareness, and in reducing, to varying extents,\nthe proportion of humanity excluded from full moral status. But\nbecause they exclude some humans, and may include some non-human\nanimals, they do not fully capture commonsense views about moral\nstatus and will be unacceptable to some philosophers. Moreover, these\nalternative attributes do not resolve, but merely relocate, the\nproblem of accounting for the threshold and range features of full\nmoral status. \nOne attribute—the potential for any other individual\nattribute held to suffice for full moral status—comes much\ncloser to full inclusion (Kumar 2008). But it faces three formidable\nproblems. As Joel Feinberg (1986) famously argued, the fact that\nsomeone has the mere potential for an attribute does not warrant\ntreating him as if he actually possessed it. If potential has moral\nsignificance, it cannot be directly inferred from the moral\nsignificance of that which it actualizes. Further, some human beings\nnever have the potential for any individual attribute held to suffice\nfor full moral status, in any sense of “potential” that\nwould distinguish them from many non-human animals (McMahan 2008,\n91–92). As debates about the moral status of the fetus suggest,\nit is not at all clear when a being has the “potential”\nfor an attribute. The claim that someone has potential is a\ncounterfactual: in some other circumstances, perhaps a later\nlife-stage of the individual, the person would have the attribute.\nThis brings in difficult questions about the scope of such\ncounterfactuals. On a broad enough construal, every living being has\nthe potential to develop the relevant attributes in a sufficiently\ndifferent possible world, and so has full moral\n status.[8]\n  \nMatthew Liao has argued for “the genetic basis for moral\nagency” as a sufficient condition for full moral status that is\nmore plausible and inclusive than a potentiality criterion (Liao\n2010). It accords full moral status to humans who have lost the\npotential for agency, and to radically disabled humans who never had\nsuch potential, in any conventional sense of that term. But it\nincludes these individuals at the cost of including almost all human\nembryos—a cost many would consider excessive. Moreover,\nLiao’s account requires a conceptually difficult, morally\nuncertain distinction between genomes that have and lack “the basis\nfor moral agency” (e.g., Wasserman 2002; McMahan 2002, 2008).\nPotentiality accounts face similar line-drawing problems; the question\nis whether the shift from “potential” to “genetic basis” makes\nthose problems any more tractable. The genetic basis account also\nshares what many would regard as a problem of “over\ninclusiveness”—they confer moral status on early embryos, which\nhave the genetic basis for moral agency, at least as clearly as they\nhave the potential for it. To justify abortion, proponents of either\naccount must rely on a woman’s right to withdraw gestational\naid. \nThese challenges are inherited by two accounts that seek to base moral\nstatus on the possession of a “modal property.” Shelley Kagan\n(2016) and Jonathan Surovell (forthcoming) argue that beings who had,\nor could have had, the psychological capacities of typical human\nbeings are their moral equals. According to both accounts, human\nbeings who lost, or never had, those capacities due to illness or\nimpairment still have the modal property that they could have had\nthem, and this property confers full moral status. That property is\nnot possessed by members of most other species, who could only have\nacquired those capacities in quite distant possible worlds. As\nSurovell puts it, “[d]isability but not species membership is a\nmatter of luck” (21). \nThese accounts face much the same challenge as Liao’s, of\ndetermining whether a given being “could have” developed the\npsychological capacities of human beings when their failure to do so\nresults from genetic differences. They also face the challenge posed\nby members of other species capable of identity-preserving cognitive\nupgrades (DeGrazia, 2016; McMahan, 2016). But perhaps the strongest\nobjection to grounding moral status in modal properties is raised by\nDeGrazia: even if human beings with profound cognitive impairments are\naptly characterized as victims of bad luck, why does their victimhood\nconfer moral status? Surely that status cannot be justified as a\nconsolation prize for a near miss. While this objection does not\ndirectly apply to the genetic-basis account, that account faces the\nquestion of why the biological basis for morally significant\nattributes itself has moral significance. \nA second general way of accommodating the powerful intuitions about\nthe full moral status of all human beings is to recognize alternatives\nto the actual possession of the status-conferring attributes. One\nversion of this approach treats human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as, in effect, capable of acquiring the necessary\nattributes by proxy, through their relationships with other human\nbeings. Thomas Scanlon (1998), for example, affirms the full moral\nstatus of all human beings while basing full moral status (“the\nrequirement of justifiability”) on the individual capacity for\n“judgment-sensitive” attitudes. Although he recognizes\nthat radically-impaired humans lack those attributes, he suggests that\nthey can acquire them vicariously, through trustees: \nThe tie of birth gives us good reason to want to treat [human beings\nlacking the capacity for judgment-sensitive attitudes] “as\nhumans” despite their limited capacities. Because of these\nlimitations, the idea of justifiability to them must be understood\ncounterfactually, in terms of what they could reasonably reject if\nthey were able to understand such a question. This makes the idea of\ntrusteeship appropriate in their case, whether it is appropriate in\nthe case of nonhuman animals or not. It also indicates a basis on\nwhich such a trustee could object to proposed principles. Severely\ndisabled humans have reason to want those things that any human being\nhas reason to want, insofar as those are things that they are capable\nof benefiting from. (185–186) \nScanlon himself may understand trusteeship merely as a way of\nrealizing or respecting the full moral status of human beings with\nradical impairments, a status that is based on “the ties of\nbirth.” Other philosophers, however, suggest that trusteeship\ncan secure full moral status by helping to satisfy criteria that could\nnot otherwise be met. Thus, Francis and Silvers (Francis 2009; Silvers\nand Francis 2009) argue that cognitively normal human beings can\nfunction as “mental prostheses” for radically impaired\nones: \n[A]s a prosthetic arm or leg executes some of the functions of a\nmissing fleshly limb without being confused with or supplanting the\nusual fleshly limb, so, we propose, a trustee’s reasoning and\ncommunicating can execute part or all of a subject’s own\nthinking processes without substituting the trustee’s ideas as\nif it were the subject’s own. (485) \nFor example, trustees can help the subject fashion her own conception\nof the good by carefully eliciting and extrapolating her attitudes and\npreferences. \nFrancis and Silvers do not claim that the moral status of human beings\nwith the most significant cognitive impairments could rest on such\ntrusteeship, or on the potential for it. But it is useful to consider\ntwo challenges facing their proposal, which they acknowledge. The\nfirst is the question of authorship or authenticity: It is not clear\nhow a trustee’s reasoning could be said to “execute”\nall, as opposed to part, of “a subject’s own\nthinking.” It is not clear how the thinking can be the\nsubject’s if it was wholly executed by a trustee (Wasserman and\nMcMahan, 2012). The second challenge, shared by the notion of mental\nprostheses and Scanlon’s notion of the vicarious expression of\njudgment-sensitive attitudes, is the possibility of providing such\nsupport for nonhuman animals—a possibility Scanlon leaves open\nin the above passage. If it could be extended to animals, the\npotential for such representation would ground the full moral status\nof vast numbers of primates and other mammals. To close the\nfloodgates, it would seem necessary to argue that this support was\nless feasible for intelligent animals, even domesticated ones, than it\nwas for radically impaired human beings. Clearly, an argument would be\nneeded that, in Francis and Silvers’ terms, it would be far more\ndifficult to fashion a mental prosthesis for the former. \nA proxy approach also raises the difficult question of how the trustee\ncan acquire the moral and epistemic authority to speak for an\nindividual with radical cognitive disabilities. Legal systems assign\ntrustees or guardians to represent the “best interests” of\nindividuals too immature or impaired to make, or to have made, their\nown judgments. But it is not clear how someone gets\n“appointed” as a trustee for purposes of securing moral\nstatus. Moreover, even those closest and most committed to an\nindividual with radical cognitive impairments may find it hard to\ndiscern his interests, and distinguish them from their own\n“judgment-sensitive” attitudes. \nAnother way of accommodating strong convictions about the full moral\nstatus of all human beings grounds that status in actual relationships\nbetween cognitively normal and radically-disabled human beings.\nBecause of their duties of partiality, the close relatives of\nradically impaired individuals must treat them as if they had full\nmoral status. This could be regarded as an agent-relative status: for\nclose relatives and no one else, radically disabled humans actually\nhave full moral status. But because of the full moral status of those\nclose relatives, other human beings must respect their duty to regard\ntheir disabled kin as full moral equals. They do not, however, have to\nassume that duty themselves. Some proponents of individual-attribute\naccounts—McMahan, for example—appear to take this view. In\ncontrast, some of the group-based accounts in the next section hold\nthat the “tie of birth” requires all cognitively\nnondisabled human beings to accord full moral status to\nradically-impaired human beings, regardless of their relationship. A\nweaker version of this derivative or courtesy position does not claim\nthat a human being with radical cognitive disabilities actually has\nfull moral status even for close family members, merely that they must\ntreat her as if she did. This reduces somewhat (but does not\neliminate) the disparity between family members and third parties, but\nonly by downgrading the moral status of radically-impaired humans even\nfor their most significant others. \nFor some philosophers, either version of this view is unsatisfactory,\nfor two related reasons. First, it is too narrow, since it does not\noffer radically impaired human beings complete moral equality. Only a\nsmall subset of other humans need to treat them as moral equals; the\nrest merely need to respect this special relationship. Second, it is\ntoo contingent—a human with radical cognitive impairments owes\neven his partial equality to the existence of close relationships. If\nhis parents and other relatives abandon him or die, he has only a very\ntenuous claim to being treated by the rest of humanity any better than\na non-human animal with similar attributes. \nWe would suggest yet another “evidentiary” approach to\naccommodating the conviction that every human being has full moral\nstatus, one that calls for the adoption of a strong, even\n“irrebuttable” presumption of full moral status for all\nhuman beings. This approach is based on the difficulty of assessing\nthe cognitive potential of human beings, the powerful tendency to\nunderestimate the capacity and potential of human beings with any\ndegree of cognitive abnormality, and the terrible cost to individuals\nwho warrant but are denied full moral status. This approach can be\nregarded as rule-consequentialist, in requiring that we sometimes\ndisregard our case-specific judgment because of the high probability\nand substantial costs of error. But it may appeal to many who reject\nrule-consequentialism as a general approach. At the same time, this\nrationale for full moral status may seem uncomfortably grudging and\ncontingent. It appears to imply that, with sufficiently accurate\nassessment tools and sufficiently reliable assessors, we could deny\nmoral status to many human beings whom we now are constrained to treat\nas having it. Moreover, their exclusion would represent moral\nprogress. \nSuch a presumption of full moral status for humans with radical\ncognitive disabilities could be given a more robust justification.\nThat justification would treat biological differences, species norms,\nor “ties of birth” not as providing independent grounds\nfor full moral status, but as providing very strong reasons for\npresuming it. Perhaps part of the reason we presume this is epistemic,\nbecause it is so difficult to conclude that individuals who look human\nreally lack human capacities. But that is not the whole explanation.\nWhen cognitively nondisabled humans encounter another being with human\nappearance, they customarily respond to that being in ways they do not\nto non-human animals; they use distinctive gestures, facial\nexpression, touch, speech, and other behavior. Such responses assume a\ncapacity for reciprocal exchange that may not always be present. But\neven when it is not, those responses are not idle gestures. They may\nenable communication, and provoke cognitive and social development,\nthat would otherwise not occur. Family members, friends,\nprofessionals, and scholars who work with people who have cognitive\ndisabilities report that the more time they spend with individuals who\ninitially seemed unable to communicate or respond meaningfully, the\nmore they could discern about their interests, desires, and moods\n(Brown and Gothelf 1996; Goode 1994). Indeed, those people often\ndisplay species-typical preferences in clothing, food, socializing,\nand other activities. In sustained interaction with nondisabled humans\nwho treat them as members of the same moral community, cognitively\ndisabled individuals develop socially and psychologically along the\nlines of other human beings. Treating people with cognitive\ndisabilities as if they had potential for typically human feelings,\ndesires and responses, then, can thus become self-fulfilling. This\napproach offers a pragmatic (and consequentialist) justification for\npresuming that all human beings have full moral status: not merely\nbecause of the terrible costs of mistakenly denying that status, but\nbecause treating fellow human beings as capable of joining our moral\ncommunity makes it more likely that they will be able to do so. \nThis proposal does not claim that such treatment could never be\neffective if directed toward a dolphin or chimpanzee. But we have\nstronger reasons to treat our fellow human beings this way, however\nsignificant their cognitive disabilities. Our shared embodiment and\ngenetic endowment facilitate our treating them as having the capacity\nor potential for typical human interaction and activity, and make it\nlikely that they will be more responsive to our treatment than a\nnon-human animal with similar cognitive abilities. Other intelligent\nbeings, differently embodied than we are, would have the same reasons\nto treat their fellow beings this way. In recognizing such a\nlimited partiality, we do not treat species as having a moral\nsignificance akin to that of families or even nations. Nor, clearly,\ndo we assume that human beings in particular have special moral\nstatus. \nDespite its resolute optimism, this proposal still excludes some human\nbeings from full moral status. It assumes a minimum level of social\nresponsiveness which is almost certainly lacking in human beings with\nanencephaly, and perhaps lacking in human beings with other radical\ncognitive impairments. Yet in its pragmatic justification of a limited\npartiality towards members of the same species, it sets the stage for\nviews that give a more central role to species membership. \nA number of philosophers have argued for the full moral status of all\nhuman beings, without seeking to identify any attribute possessed by\nall humans that would ground that status. These philosophers can be\nroughly divided into two groups. Those in the first group regard\nmembership in the species Homo sapiens as sufficient for full\nmoral status and ground that status in a species-based attribute (See\n Sec. 5.1).\n For some philosophers within this first group, all homo sapiens\nbelong to a kind whose nature or norm it is to possess rationality or\nsimilar attributes\n (Sec. 5.1.1).\n For others, all homo sapiens are connected through “ties of\nbirth” to other human beings\n (Sec. 5.1.2).\n For the former, any being of a kind whose nature it is to be\nrational, etc. has full moral status; for the latter, any human\nrelated by birth to other human beings has full moral status. Although\nthe two approaches pick out the same individual human beings, the way\nin which they ground moral status gives them different implications\nfor the status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments. \nThe former way of grounding moral status gives it a wider\n“writ,” because the individual’s moral status is not\nbased on his relationship to specific others. Rather, it is based on\nthe norm of a group to which she belongs. That norm demands\nrecognition by anyone, whether a member of the group or not, capable\nof recognizing it. If human beings with radical cognitive impairments\nhave full moral status by virtue of belonging to a group with the norm\nof rationality, a rational Martian, no less than a rational human,\nshould recognize the full moral status of humans with those\nimpairments. It might be possible to argue that the morally-relevant\nnorms of a group are not binding on those outside the group, but we\nhave not seen such an argument. \nIn contrast, ties of birth may not bind those lacking the same\nbiological connection; members of other species need not recognize the\nfull moral status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments.\nIn that sense, the moral status of those human beings is not as\n“full” as that of other human beings, since it must be\nrecognized only by other humans. If full moral status is based on\nduties of partiality toward members of the same group, it will be\ngroup-relative, not binding on members of other groups. \nThe second type of group-based account\n (Sec. 5.2)\n acknowledges the moral significance of the group-based attributes\nrelied on by the first type of group-based accounts. But it denies\nthat the full and equal moral status of human beings can be grounded\nin any specific attribute, even indirectly, that can be described in\nmorally neutral terms. These accounts regard “human being”\nas a thick normative concept, grounded in language and social\npractice, that is not necessarily coextensive with the biological\ncategory of “Homo sapiens,” and that has moral content\nthat cannot be derived from any descriptive attribute associated with\nit. The judgment that a being is human and therefore must be treated\nrespectfully does not consist of a value-neutral biological\nclassification and an argument that establishes the moral status of\nbeings so classified. The requirement for certain kinds of treatment,\nand the prohibition of others, is part of the meaning of “human\nbeing” and implicit in the recognition that a given individual\nis a human\n being.[9]\n Proponents of these accounts thus reject the very attempt to identify\na criterial attribute possessed by all beings with the moral status of\ncognitively normal human adults (Diamond 1978; Edwards 1997; Byrne\n2000). These philosophers reject the treatment of cognitively\nnondisabled adults as a paradigm for full moral status, and of\ninfants, young children, and radically cognitively disabled adults as\n“marginal cases” whose moral status needs to be justified\nby\n extension.[10] \nFor both types of group-based accounts, the categorical nature of full\nmoral status is explained by the way in which that status is grounded.\nMembership in the human species, a sufficient condition of that status\nfor accounts of both types, is a categorical rather than a continuous\n“variable” (although there may be some vagueness or\nambiguity due to imprecise or conflicting membership criteria). And\nfor both types of account, the grounding of full moral status is the\nsame for all human beings, regardless of their individual\nattributes. \nOn the first relational approach, some of the properties identified by\nintrinsic-attribute accounts as sufficient for full moral status can\nalso play a distinct role in attaining it. Although, on this view,\nself-consciousness and practical rationality are not necessary for\nfull moral status, they are the norm for human beings. This norm\ncannot be understood statistically; it would not change if most or all\nhumans ceased to be self-conscious or practically rational. Rather,\nthe norm captures what is characteristic of the species. A normal\nattribute is not, however, an essence that each member must possess.\nRather, it is a relational property: each individual has moral status\nas the member of a group for which that attribute is the norm.\nScanlon, for example, claims that the class of those to whom we must\njustify our actions “includes at least those beings who are of a\nkind that is normally capable of judgment-sensitive attitudes”\n(1998, 186). \nSpecies-norm accounts focus on the human species, but they are not\nlimited to humans. Presumably, if we discovered that dolphins or\nMartians were a species with a similar cognitive norm, members of that\nspecies would possess full moral status whether or not they satisfied\nthat norm. We would be bound to recognize (if they could) the full\nmoral status of all dolphins or Martians, and they would be bound to\nrecognize the full moral status of all humans. \nThere may appear to be a tension in grounding full and equal moral\nstatus in norms to which some but not all members conform. Even if the\nnorm of practical rationality gives all group members equal moral\nstatus, it might seem that those members actually possessing that\nattribute would be “more equal” than those lacking it. The\nresponse to this concern, which we discuss in\n Sec. 5.2,\n is that those possessing the attribute have better fortune but no\ngreater moral status. \nNot surprisingly, proponents of intrinsic attribute accounts, such as\nMcMahan, are unsympathetic with the claim that “facts about the\nnature of some individuals could determine how other individuals that\nlack that nature ought to be treated” (McMahan 2008, 85). Like\nother critics, McMahan sees this claim as requiring a kind of\n“moral alchemy” that transmutes factual claims about some\nindividuals into moral demands concerning others. But for those who\nregard humanity as a “thick” concept\n (5.2),\n no alchemy is required. The concept of a human being is a normative\none, conferring rights on all those who fall under it and imposing\nmoral demands on those who understand and apply it. \nA second kind of species-relationship claimed to confer moral status\nis not between the individual human and the species norm, but between\nthe individual human and other human beings, in particular, those who\nare cognitively normal. The claim is that human beings have a reason,\nbased on co-membership in the species, to regard each other as moral\nequals. As Scanlon (1998) asserts, \n[T]he mere fact that a being is ‘of human born’ provides a\nstrong reason for according it the same status as other humans. This\nhas sometimes been characterized as prejudice, called speciesism. But\nit is not prejudice to hold that our own relation to these beings\ngives us reason to accept the requirement that our actions be\njustifiable to them. (185)  \nThis position grounds full moral status in the kinship of all human\nbeings—what used to be called “the family of man.”\nAlthough this kinship currently depends on birth to a human mother, it\nis shared by all human beings and does not vary with degree of\n consanguinity.[11] \nThis approach avoids the questionable notion of a species norm as a\nsource of moral status. But unlike a species-norm account, it requires\nno one but human beings to recognize the full moral status of all\nhumans. On the species norm account, McMahan (2002) observes,  \n[I]ntelligent and morally sensitive Martians would be required to\ntreat severely retarded human beings in the same way they would be\nrequired to treat us. … But if the reason we have to accord the\nseverely retarded the same moral status as other human beings is that\nwe are related to them through the ‘tie of birth,’ then\nMartians would not have this reason. (217)  \nThis is a practically insignificant limitation at present, but an\nexpressively significant one for those who insist that moral status be\nuniversally recognized. \nA defender of a human kinship approach might readily accept this\nlimitation, especially since we and the Martians would still be\nconstrained by the attachments of the cognitively normal members of\nthe other species to their radically impaired relations (as discussed\nin\n Sec. 4.2\n above). But she would still have to defend the claim that\nco-membership in the species established the sort of kinship that\nrequired even this species-relative full moral status. McMahan (2002)\nargues that even if membership in some groups, like nations, could\nconfer full and equal status on its members, membership in the same\nspecies could not: \nUnlike membership in a nation, membership in a species is not a focus\nof collective identity. Being human does not significantly\ndifferentiate us from anything else; it therefore fails to engage our\npride or enhance our sense of identity. Just as no one’s sense\nof identity is enlarged by the recognition that one is an animal\nrather than a plant, so no one’s sense of identity is\nimportantly shaped by an awareness of being human rather than being,\nfor example, a rabbit. (221) \nThe defender of a “ties of birth” account could respond in\ntwo ways. First, she might deny that species identity and pride were\nnecessary to ground the full moral status of species members. Rather,\nthat status was grounded in similarities among human beings, even\nradically disabled ones, that arose from their distinctive embodiment\nand that created a strong sense of fellowship (among those\nself-conscious enough to feel fellowship) overshadowing even vast\ndifferences in mental capacity. These similarities include ways of\nfeeling, communicating, moving, and reacting to and interacting with\nother members of the species. These affinities are refracted by\nculture, members of other species share some of them, and not all\nmembers of the species—even cognitively normal ones—share\nall of them. Nevertheless, they may be a distinctive enough ensemble\nto provide a basis for partiality. Or a defender might argue, as\nBernard Williams (2006) does (see\n Sec. 5.2),\n that species-identity and pride could play a role in human\nfellowship now obscured by the lack of a suitable comparison class.\nAlthough, as Robert Nozick (1974) observed, no contemporary human\nboasts about having an opposable thumb or speaking a language, our\nsense of species pride and identity might crystallize in the presence\nof another advanced species, which would highlight our distinctive\nshared history and achievements. \nStanding alone, however, both responses seem vulnerable to the claim\nthat similarities associated with species membership may explain, but\ncannot justify, the treatment of all other human beings as moral\nequals. Why should a sense of fellowship, however strong, be a source\nof moral status? If our sense of fellowship reflected what mattered\nmorally, why wouldn’t we feel greater fellowship with\nMcMahan’s intelligent, morally sensitive Martian than with a\nhuman infant whose developmental disabilities make him apparently\nunresponsive to other humans? \nOne response is that what justifies intra-species partiality is not\nthe capacity to share but the capacity to benefit. Thus, Gunnarson\n(2008) suggests that members of our own species have a capacity to\nderive unique, intrinsic benefits from their relationship to other\nhuman beings. Reliance on such a capacity may provide an intuitively\nmore appealing basis for full moral status than biologically-based\nsimilarities. But it might still deny full moral status to some\nhumans—not only anencephalic infants but others lacking the\ncapacity to benefit from relations with other humans. Moreover, some\nnon-human animals, especially domesticated ones, may derive immense\nbenefits that are intrinsic and unique to their relationship to humans\n(Townley 2010). And the members of other cognitively advanced species\nmight well benefit in highly specific, possibly unique ways, from\ninteraction with human beings. \nTo explain the moral significance of species co-membership, some\nphilosophers embrace a strongly anthropocentric view, which denies\nthat we can step outside of our humanity to assess the moral status of\nthe world’s inhabitants. On this view, the concept of a human\nbeing is prior to, and inseparable from, that of a\n person.[12]\n As Stephen Mulhall (2002) argues: \n[O]ur concept of a person is an outgrowth or aspect of our concept of\na human being; and that concept is not merely biological but rather a\ncrystallisation of everything we have made of our distinctive species\nnature. To see another as a human being is to see her as a\nfellow-creature—another being whose embodiment embeds her in a\ndistinctive form of common life with language and culture, and whose\nexistence constitutes a particular kind of claim on us. (7) \nThis view, which, following Williams (2006), we will call\n“humanist,” has two variants. The first, per Mulhall, is\nlinguistic or conceptual, influenced by Wittgenstein (1958). We come\nto understand notions like thinking, deciding, and feeling in terms of\nthe behavior of other human beings, and, although we can attribute\nsome of these capacities or states to other beings, it is only by\nextension or analogy (Hanfling 2001). We also learn the appropriate\nways of acting toward fellow human beings in learning the very\nconcept: for example, human beings are to be named, and not eaten even\nwhen they are dead. We do not conclude that human beings must\nbe treated this way; the recognition that they must is already part of\nthe meaning of the concept (Diamond 1978; Gleeson\n 2008).[13]\n This “thick” concept of human being is not a biological\none, and need not have the same extension as the class of Homo\n sapiens[14].\n For some humanists of this type, a newly-created embryo is not a\nhuman being, and it is not part of the meaning of human being that the\nlife of a newly-fertilized embryo must be protected to the same extent\nas the life of a newborn human infant (Crary 2007). But the very fact\nthat other humanists do regard early embryos as human beings\nsuggests the need for an account of how such a deeply-embedded concept\ncan be so vague or debatable at the margins. \nBecause of the role of our language and concepts in our moral\nunderstanding, the justification and criticism of our moral practices\ncan only be internal to them, on humanist accounts. As Byrne\nmaintains, \nreason operates in ethics properly when it functions immanently.\nOffering a sound moral argument in criticism of any one of our moral\npractices would be a matter of drawing upon insight from some other\npart of our moral life. (2000, 70–71) \nThe case against eating animals, for example, cannot be made by citing\nattributes they share with us, but only by exposing tensions or\ncontradictions with our other practices (Diamond 1978). Presumably,\nsimilar but more acute tensions would confront any view of humanity\nthat excluded some biological human beings or denied some of them full\nmoral status, making racism and sexism untenable without placing any\npressure on the concept of humanity itself. \nThe second variant denies the possibility of an impartial basis for\nassessing moral status. To attempt to grade or evaluate the\nworld’s inhabitants in absolute terms is to treat the universe\nas having a point of view—the perspective of a deity or a\nutilitarian Ideal Observer (Williams 2006). Without such a vantage\npoint, human beings can judge the rest of the world only in terms of\ntheir own concerns, values and civilization. Indeed, it is only in\nthose terms that we value those characteristics, like rationality and\nself-consciousness, regarded by individual-attribute theorists as\ncriteria for full moral status (Grau, 2016). Our humanity thus gives\nus an indispensable frame of reference for evaluating the rest of the\nworld. It also grounds a defensible partiality toward each other that\nhas little in common with racism or sexism. Not only do almost all of\nus accept naked appeals to the humanity of another being, as opposed\nto her sex or race, as the basis for action or restraint, we appeal to\nhumanity in rejecting racism and sexism. Naked appeals to race or sex,\nunsupported by claims about morally relevant attributes, are rarely\nmade by the most unapologetic racist or sexist. The “human\nprejudice” is more akin to the affinity and loyalty of\nparticipants in a shared culture. If it is difficult to see “the\nhuman prejudice” this way, it may be because “[h]uman\nbeings do not have to deal with any other creature that, in terms of\nargument, principle, worldview, or whatever, can answer back”\n(Williams 2006, 148). A distinctively human “culture” is\nboth pervasive and barely visible in a world that offers no rivals.\nWilliams does not claim that our commitment to that culture would\nnecessarily trump an appeal to participate in a more advanced\nuniversal community and relinquish cherished but parochial aspects of\nour own culture. Nevertheless, that commitment would give us a morally\ndefensible reason, not just a prejudice, against such\nassimilation. \nHumanist accounts recognize that species norms have moral\nsignificance, but they do not assign them the criterial role they play\nin accounts that ground moral status in relational attributes. In the\npassage from which we quoted earlier, Mulhall regards radically\ndisabled humans as suffering a grave misfortune in lacking\ncharacteristically human capacities: \nWe do not strive (when we do strive) to treat human infants and\nchildren, the senile and the severely disabled as fully human because\nwe mistakenly attribute capacities to them that they lack, or because\nwe are blind to the merely biological significance of a species\nboundary. We do it (when we do) because they are fellow human beings,\nembodied creatures who will come to share, or have already shared, in\nour common life, or whose inability to do so is a result of the shocks\nand ills to which all human flesh and blood is heir—because\nthere but for the grace of God go I. (Mulhall 2002, 7) \nFor a humanist like Mulhall, the capacity to participate in\ndistinctively human forms of life is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor full moral status (as McMahan (2005) appears to assume). That\nstatus is established merely by our recognition of an individual as a\nhuman being, heir to the same “shocks and ills” as we are.\nHuman beings with radical cognitive disabilities suffer “grave\nmisfortune,” not reduced status if they are unable to share in\nthe distinctive forms of our common life in which their embodiment has\n“embedded” them. Non-human animals with similar attributes\nhave lower moral status but suffer no comparable estrangement or loss.\nTheir participation in their own species’ distinctive forms of\nlife—if there are any—does not depend upon, and might well\nbe impaired by, their possession of the cognitive attributes of normal\nadult humans.  \nA critic might concede that we in fact hold these divergent attitudes\ntoward humans and non-human animals but would question their moral\nsignificance: why should we regard the congenital absence of certain\ncapacities as a tragedy for the individual lacking them if\nand only if that individual is human (McMahan 1996)? A humanist would\nrespond that the question itself reveals that the critic simply is not\nclear on the concept of “human being”—a concept that\nincludes the notion of a common life, based on shared embodiment, from\nwhich radically impaired humans are excluded. \nHumanists are wary of grounding the full moral status of\nradically-impaired humans in their relationship to a species-norm like\nrationality. Thus, Byrne (2000) argues that appeal to the rational\nnature of human beings as the basis for respect is too reliant on\nexternal justification and too narrow. It is too reliant on claims\nabout the respect owed to beings that are rational-by-nature, which\nByrne doubts are any more self-evident or plausible than claims about\nthe respect owed human beings. It is too narrow because it ignores\nother aspects of humanity that make the concept of “human\nbeing” so rich and powerful. \nThe position of humanists on the species-relativity of moral status is\nuncertain. Given the critical role they assign to “the\ndistinctive form of common life” of human beings for moral\nrecognition and obligation, it is not obvious that Mulhall or Diamond\nwould require an intelligent Martian to recognize and respect the\nmoral status of cognitively normal human beings, let alone of human\nbeings with radical cognitive impairments. Indeed, it is not clear how\nhumans could confidently impute intelligence to Martians if their\nembodiment was sufficiently different from ours, let alone whether we\ncould regard them as subject to moral obligations of any kind.\nSimilarly, it is not clear whether Mulhall and Diamond would hold that\nhumans were required to treat Martians as moral equals, even if they\ncould attribute intelligence and moral sensitivity to them. The role\nthey assign to distinctively human forms of life raises doubts about\nthe possibility of mutual comprehension, recognition, and respect. \nIn contrast, Williams’ account, and others less wedded to a\nWittgenstinian view of language and concepts, can more readily address\nthe prospect of close encounters with other intelligent beings.\nWilliams himself considers such encounters, and acknowledges the\npossibility of mutual recognition, though he thinks it might be\nreasonably qualified by partiality towards the members of one’s\nown species and its culture. \nThese two humanist accounts leave critical questions about the\nboundaries of the thick concept of “human being.” Does\nthat concept encompass early embryos, or human-like beings produced by\na future synthetic biology? Can we answer such questions in terms of\nthe “fit” of a proposed boundary with the other beliefs\nand practices associated with the concept, or are such questions\ndecided less self-consciously by gradual shifts in our actual\npractices? Without a better sense of how boundary questions can be\nresolved, it is not clear how humanist accounts will meet the\nchallenges of exclusion. \nThere seems to be little prospect for consensus on the moral status of\npeople with the most severe cognitive disabilities. There are sharp\ndisagreements about how, or even whether, the moral status of humans\ncan be grounded, and about the weight to be given our strongest and\nmost considered, moral convictions. Accounts that ground full moral\nstatus in an individual’s possession of psychological attributes\ninevitably exclude some portion of humanity, and appear to have\nimplications for the treatment of the excluded human beings that few\nof us are willing to accept. Those implications are avoided by\naccounts that ground full moral status in our species\nmembership—in the nature of the species or in our biological\nrelationships to other members. Those implications are also avoided by\naccounts that deny the need to ground the moral status of human beings\nin any attribute we or our group possesses. But these ways of avoiding\nexclusion have significant costs. They require a strong partiality\ntoward those with shared biological features, physical appearances, or\norigins, a partiality that conflicts with equally strong, if more\nabstract convictions about the justification for our conduct towards\nothers. And they leave deep uncertainty about the moral constraints on\nour treatment of other living beings and about the boundaries of\nhumanity itself. \nDespite the serious challenges facing both approaches, and the\nformidable obstacles to reaching any sort of consensus, the discussion\nabout the moral status of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities is a central one for applied ethics. It needs to\ncontinue.","contact.mail":"jblustein@ccny.cuny.edu","contact.domain":"ccny.cuny.edu"},{"date.published":"2012-07-06","date.changed":"2017-08-11","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-disability/","author1":"David Wasserman","author2":"Adrienne Asch","author1.info":"https://philosophy.dartmouth.edu/people/daniel-putnam","entry":"cognitive-disability","body.text":"\n\n\nWhy are cognitive disability and moral status thought to be\nsufficiently connected to warrant a separate entry? The reason is that\nindividuals with cognitive disabilities have served as test cases in\ndebates about the moral relevance of possessing such intellectual\nattributes as self-consciousness and practical rationality. If a\nsignificant portion of human beings lacks self-consciousness and\npractical rationality, then those attributes cannot by themselves\ndistinguish the way we treat cognitively developed human beings from\nthe way we treat non-human animals and human fetuses. If we cannot\nexperiment on or kill human beings who lack those attributes, then the\nlack of those attributes alone cannot be what justifies animal\nexperimentation or abortion.\n\n\nFor the most part, the philosophers who have considered these claims\nwere not primarily concerned with the treatment or moral status of\ncognitively disabled human beings—they sought to challenge\nexisting practices toward fetuses or animals, or the rationales for\nsuch practices. But those claims have significant practical\nimplications for cognitively disabled human beings. If the\njustification for treating living beings in certain ways does\nrest to some extent on their possession or lack of intellectual\nattributes, then it may be acceptable to treat cognitively disabled\nhuman beings in ways that it would be unacceptable to treat\ncognitively nondisabled humans. This implication, a kind of\nphilosophical blowback from the debates on animal rights and abortion,\nhas become the subject of sustained controversy in applied ethics.\n\n\nPhilosophers who question the moral status of human beings with the\nmost significant cognitive disabilities often compare them to animals\nclaimed to have similar or greater cognitive abilities (McMahan 1996,\n2002, 2009; Singer 1993, 2009; and Wilkinson 2008 in Other Internet\nResources). Some critics find these comparisons unnecessary and\noffensive (e.g., Carlson 2009; Carlson and Kittay 2009). The\nphilosophers who make such comparisons emphasize contrasts like the\nfollowing: Vast numbers of chimpanzees and other “higher”\nprimates are used in painful and often lethal research for the benefit\nof human beings. Although there are strong objections to specific\nprimate research programs and research on specific primates, there is\nbroad agreement that most primate research is acceptable if it has the\npotential to contribute significantly to human health, and if the\nharms and risks to the animal subjects are minimized. In contrast,\ncognitively disabled human beings cannot be enrolled in potentially\nharmful research unless they are likely to benefit, the risk of harm\nis negligible, and their legal representatives consent to their\nparticipation. They enjoy these protections even if they are no better\nable than non-human primates to understand the aims of the research or\nto consent to\n participation.[1]\n \n\nThe debate over the moral status of individuals with the most severe\ncognitive disabilities also raises difficult methodological issues\nconcerning the reliance on intuitions, convictions, and considered\njudgments in assessing moral arguments. Some philosophers would deny\nthat any argument should persuade us to abandon our conviction that it\nwould be terribly wrong to subject a human being cognitively incapable\nof consent to painful and dangerous experimentation of no possible\nbenefit to him (e.g., Kittay 2008). Two philosophers have adapted G.E.\nMoore’s “proof” of the existence of the external world (see\nEntry on\n George Edward Moore)\n to claim that we are more confident of the truth of the proposition\nthat all human beings are morally equal, and morally superior to other\nanimals than of the validity of the arguments denying it (Curtis and\nVehmas, 2016a, 2016b). Other philosophers reject the application of\nMoore’s argument to moral status (Lachlan, 2016; Roberts\nforthcoming); more broadly, they insist that even firm convictions\nabout moral status cannot be immune from critical scrutiny, especially\nif they appear to conflict with other deeply held convictions (McMahan\n2007). Still others deny such convictions any presumptive weight or\nauthority (Singer 2005).\n\n\nFinally, in addressing the moral status of cognitively disabled humans\nin a separate entry, rather than in a general entry on disability, we\nare not endorsing a controversial “exceptionalism” about\ncognitive disabilities—a view that regards them as fundamentally\ndifferent from other kinds of impairment (see\n Related Entries below).\n Our reason for limiting ourselves to cognitive impairment is\ndialectical: there is currently no debate about the moral status of\nindividuals with non-cognitive disabilities. We know of no serious\nphilosopher who argues that people who cannot see, hear, or use their\nlegs, or who experience frequent depression or hallucinations, have\nlower moral status than people without such disabilities. Admittedly,\nsome philosophers claiming to regard humans with physical or\npsychiatric disabilities as having the same moral status as\nnondisabled humans also take positions that other philosophers see as\ninconsistent with a commitment to equal moral status. One notable\nexample is Rawls’ (1971) exclusion of people with physical\ndisabilities from the Original Position on the assumption that they\nare not fully cooperating members of society. Another example is the\ndefense of “quality adjustment” in allocating scarce\nhealthcare resources, which discounts the life-years of people with\ndisabilities to reflect their supposedly lower quality of life\n(Williams 1987). But whether or not these positions are consistent\nwith the recognition of full moral status, their proponents insist\nthat they are; they do not attempt to argue against the equal moral\nstatus of people with physical or (most) psychiatric disabilities. By\ncontrast, the moral status of human beings with cognitive disabilities\nhas become a subject of intense debate among philosophers, applied\nethicists, and disability scholars (for a recent discussion, see\nCarlson and Kittay 2009).\n\n\nWe will proceed as follows. We will first characterize the human\nbeings who are the subject of the debate on moral status—those\nwith what we will call “radical cognitive disabilities.”\nAfter discussing the ways in which humans are classified as\ncognitively disabled, we will describe the narrower category of humans\nwhom the debate concerns. To be clear, this is a group of humans\nstipulated to exist rather than classified by empirical procedures. We\nwill note the difficulty of separating claims about such stipulated\nindividuals from claims that some actual individuals satisfy that\nstipulation. Next, we will characterize the concept of moral status,\ndescribing its structure and function. We will then outline the\nprincipal differences in how that concept is understood, particularly\nits “inclusion criteria”—the criteria for ascribing\nwhat we will call “full moral status,” the status\nattributed to cognitively nondisabled adult human beings. (In calling\nthat moral status “full,” we do not intend to take sides\nin the debates over whether there can be any higher moral status.) We\nwill identify one family of moral-status accounts—those basing\npossession on individual attributes—as the primary, though not\nthe exclusive, source of the challenge addressed in this entry: the\nclaim that some human beings lack full moral status. After outlining\nthose accounts, we will review several ways of meeting the challenge:\n1) basing full moral status on individual attributes shared by a\ngreater proportion of human beings; 2) adopting secondary grounds for\nthe possession of full moral status—by “courtesy” or\nby “proxy”; 3) rejecting individual attribute accounts in\nfavor of accounts that base the full moral status of all human beings\non their species membership or their humanity. \n\nThere is, not surprisingly, disagreement about how to define cognitive\nor intellectual disability. (We will use these terms interchangeably,\nignoring, unless specifically relevant, their apparent differences in\nbreadth and emphasis.) There are competing psychometric and functional\ndefinitions, based respectively on standard deviations from the mean\nscore on intelligence tests and on “significant limitations both\nin intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers\nmany everyday social and practical skills” (American Association\nof Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, 2011). For this entry,\nwe will consider individuals defined as cognitively disabled in\nfunctional terms, because our interest is in the moral relevance, if\nany, of the absence or substantial limitation of critical cognitive\nfunctions. These limitations are more likely to be captured by\nfunctional than psychometric tests, though as we discuss later, the\nformer as well as the latter may fail to detect significant\nintellectual capacities. We will not assume that, or examine whether,\nindividuals with psychometrically-defined “severe” or\n“profound” intellectual disabilities are functionally\ndisabled in this way. \nAs noted, this entry will focus on human beings with “radical\ncognitive\n disabilities”[2]\n — disabilities in intellectual function and capacity that limit\nor preclude the development of one or more attributes believed to\nconfer full moral status. Among those attributes are the consciousness\nof oneself as a temporally-extended being; practical\nrationality—the capacity to govern one’s actions by\nreasoning about how to act; and the capacity to make and respond to\nmoral demands. (We will often abbreviate the list to\n“self-consciousness or practical rationality” without\nmaking any assumptions about the centrality or relationship of the two\nattributes.) These attributes, as well as others held to be required\nfor full moral status, may be possessed by different subsets of human\nbeings, and the relationship among such attributes is a matter of\nconsiderable dispute. This dispute, however, is best deferred to a\nfuller treatment of the grounds of moral status; we will discuss them\nonly to the extent that they bear on the moral status of human beings\nwith significant cognitive disabilities. \nThe category of “radical cognitive disability” is\nstipulative. We do not start with the assumption that any specific\nhuman being falls into that category, or even that some human beings\ndo. Eva Kittay (2005) has argued that there is no reason to assume\nthat any human beings are radically cognitively disabled, in the sense\nwe are using the term. Jeff McMahan (2009) has countered that the\nexistence of such human beings is very likely: given the continuous\nnature of fetal and infant neurological development, it is very likely\nthat some human beings are radically disabled because their\ndevelopment has ceased or been interrupted at points where they have\nnot yet acquired morally relevant capacities. Even if McMahan’s\n“existence argument” for radical impairment is correct,\nhowever, it does not remove the daunting uncertainty of attributing\nradical cognitive impairment to any actual human being. \nThis uncertainty arises in part from a lack of clarity and consensus\nabout what would count as adequate evidence of self- and\nother-awareness and practical rationality. To resolve that question,\nit is necessary to confront not only interpretive ambiguities in\nmaking inferences about the content of other minds, but conceptual\nissues about what it means to possess critical cognitive functions.\nSimilar issues are raised in the debate about animal consciousness\n(see the Entry on\n animal consciousness),\n but there is also disagreement about whether the kinds of evidence\nadduced for and against the cognitive capacities of animals are\nequally relevant in assessing the cognitive capacities of human beings\n(Kittay 2005; McMahan 2002, 2005, 2008). \nThe primary reason for restricting the entry to radical cognitive\ndisability, like the reason for restricting it to cognitive\ndisability, is dialectical. Few contemporary philosophers would deny\nthat human beings with mild or moderate cognitive disabilities have\nthe attributes required for what we call “full moral\nstatus.” Philosophers who see self-consciousness and practical\nrationality as necessary for that status generally recognize that\nmildly and moderately disabled humans possess those attributes, and\npossess them to the extent necessary to reach the threshold set by\ntheir accounts of full moral status (see\n Sec. 2.1). \nBy stipulating a category of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities, we seek to avoid difficult empirical issues about the\nextent to which individuals classified as having serious cognitive\ndisabilities actually lack the psychological functions held to confer\nmoral status. Even the most direct assessments of these functions may\nfail to recognize atypical, especially nonverbal, forms of cognitive\nfunctioning. And with the possible exception of extreme cases like\nanencephaly, there are formidable difficulties in inferring a lack of\ncognitive capacity from a lack of specific behavior or brain activity.\nAs recent work on intellectually conscious states has revealed (Wannez\net al. 2017, Real et al. 2015), some psychological capacities are\ndifficult to detect neurologically or behaviorally. \nWe recognize that there are objections to the use of stipulation to\nsidestep these difficult empirical issues. Disability scholars insist\nthat philosophers must recognize that the terms they use will\ninevitably be taken to refer to actual human beings, so that they\ncannot stipulate away concerns about hurt and misinterpretation\n(Kittay 2005; Wong 2007). Moreover, the prevalence of individuals who\nactually satisfy their stipulations has relevance to morally\nsignificant policy issues, such as the costs and benefits of more\ninclusive educational practices. Nevertheless, we will rely on the\nstipulation that we have made about radical cognitive disability, in\npart because the assumption that some human beings are radically\ndisabled is shared by many of those who argue for the full\nmoral status of all human beings.  \nWe will discuss only radical cognitive disabilities that are\ncongenital or early-onset. The question of how moral status is\naffected by the loss of important cognitive functions is a\ndistinct one, both for those who believe such functions confer moral\nstatus and those who do not. Concerning the former, the question is\nwhether moral status can survive the loss of the functions on the\nbasis of which it was conferred. For those who deny that moral status\nrequires the possession of those functions, their loss may still raise\nimportant questions about personal identity, and about the\nfirst-person authority of the earlier, nondisabled self over the\nlater, disabled self. The treatment of “once-competent”\nindividuals in minimally conscious states, or with severe dementia,\nthus raises distinct issues about the impact of psychological\ndiscontinuity or loss of mental function on the relationship of human\nindividuals to their past or future selves. There has been a\nprotracted controversy, and a large literature, on these issues\n(Dresser 1995; Dworkin 1994; Stone 2007); they deserve separate\ndiscussion. \n“Moral status” is not part of the shared vocabulary of all\nethical theories. An act utilitarian, for example, has no more use for\nthat concept than for “respect,” “rights,” or\n“inviolability.” For a theory that accorded weight to\nbeings only in proportion to the utility they enjoyed or produced, the\nconcept of moral status would be relevant only in the indirect sense\nthat its use would affect aggregate utility in various ways. For\nexample, the negative utility that might result from denying some\nhuman beings full moral status might support a policy of treating all\nhuman beings as if they had full moral status (see\n Sec. 4).\n On such a theory, the most salient moral property of an individual is\nher capacity to occupy states that can be characterized as\n“good” or “bad,” the most obvious being\npleasure and pain. The possession of such a capacity gives an\nindividual a morally considerable interest in occupying or avoiding\nsuch states. Moral considerability is: 1) continuous, in that the\ndegree of moral considerability that a being possesses varies in\nproportion to the strength, character, and number of its interests;\nand 2) asymmetrical, in the sense that a being might have moral claims\non others without others having moral claims on it. \nWhen non-utilitarian philosophers discuss “moral status”\nof a type of being, they are generally using a more categorical notion\nthan moral considerability. They generally understand moral status as\na threshold concept and a range concept. Beings that fall below a\nminimum level—the threshold—of a status-conferring\nattribute like rationality lack a certain kind of moral status despite\npossessing the attribute to some degree. And all beings that fall\nwithin the “range”—that reach the threshold level of\nthe attribute—have the same moral status regardless of how far\nthey exceed that threshold. (The term “range concept”\ncomes from Rawls; his example is of points within a circle, all of\nwhich are equally “inside” despite varying distances from\nthe circumference.) More controversially, moral status is sometimes\nregarded as symmetrical: a being must be able to have moral claims\nmade on it (and hence be capable of responsibility) as well as being\nable to make moral claims on others. A symmetry condition would\nexclude any human being lacking the capacity to have moral claims made\non them—not only individuals with radical cognitive impairments,\nbut infants and young children as well. \nNot all writers on moral status treat it as both a threshold and range\nconcept. Both features of the concept have been challenged, and the\nconcept itself has been criticized as hierarchical and elitist (Birch\n1993). Several philosophers have argued for treating moral status as a\nmatter of degree, so that a being’s moral status varies\nproportionately with its morally-relevant attributes (Perring 1997;\nDeGrazia 2008). These proposals avoid uncomfortably sharp dichotomies,\nbut they have a revisionary character. Even if commonsense morality\nrecognizes some gradations in moral status, well-established social\npractices such as animal research assume discontinuities. Moreover,\neven if common sense could be reconciled to gradations below the\nthreshold (which would thereby become less of a threshold), it would\nbalk at recognizing gradations above it, thereby abandoning moral\nstatus as a range concept. \nMore comprehensively, Mary Ann Warren has proposed a multi-criterial\naccount of moral status, in which it is neither a range nor a\nthreshold concept. For Warren, the moral status of a being varies with\nthe degree that it possesses the status-conferring attribute (Warren\n 1997).[3]\n But Warren maintains that “full moral status” is both a\nthreshold and a range concept; beings with moral agency enjoy the\nsame, highest moral status regardless of the degree to which they\npossess the attributes needed for moral agency. As noted earlier, we\nwill use the term “full moral status” to refer to the\nmoral status that is generally accorded to cognitively nondisabled\nhuman adults, without assuming that there can be no higher status.\n“Full moral status” is thus roughly synonymous with\n“personhood” as that term is used in debates about whether\nfetuses, or higher primates, are persons. \nThe issue of moral status, and which beings have full moral status,\nhas become important because of its bearing on the rights and\ntreatment of those beings. “Moral status” and “full\nmoral status” are not intended as honorifics; their ascription\nto a being entails that it enjoys rights that other beings, lacking\nthat status, do not. The particular rights entailed by full moral\nstatus may, however, differ on different moral theories. Two theories\nwith the same concept of moral status and the same criteria for\nassigning it (see\n Sec. 2.2)\n may associate full moral status with different rights or rights of\ndifferent strength. One theory might, for example, hold that beings\nwith full moral status may never be used as mere means, whereas\nanother might hold that they may be so used in certain emergencies.\nThere is, though, only partial independence between the formal\ncharacter of and criteria for moral status, on the one hand, and the\nrights entailed by such status, on the other. For example, it would\nseem implausible for a theory to recognize a categorical notion of\nmoral status while rejecting any notion of rights. An account of moral\nstatus need not deny all rights to beings falling below the threshold\nit sets; they will merely lack the same package of rights possessed by\nbeings above that threshold. \nTwo philosophers (Sachs, 2011; Silvers, 2011) have questioned the\nutility of the concept of “moral status.” Sachs argues\nthat claims about moral status are unnecessary and confusing, because\nthe debate is really about the specific attributes needed to justify\nor ground specific rights. Silvers offers an even harsher critique.\nShe charges that proponents of both psychologically and biologically\nbased criteria (see\n Sec. 4,\n Sec. 5, below) neglect gradations in relevant characteristics\nand overlook the potential to display or develop those\ncharacteristics, resulting in unwarranted exclusion. As an\nalternative, Silvers proposes an account of justice that, avoiding\nprior assumptions about capacity, seeks to include as many beings as\npossible within a scheme of social cooperation. \nAlthough moral status claims may well obscure more often than they\nenlighten, they do not, however, merely concern the grounding of\nspecific rights in specific attributes. First, as noted above,\ntheories that share the same criteria for full moral status may differ\nin the rights they associate with that status, and vice-versa.\nMoreover, even if Silvers is correct about the exclusionary tendencies\nof moral status notions, the prior question remains of whether their\nthreshold and range features can be justified. How can the small\ndifferences in morally-relevant attributes that place a being above or\nbelow the threshold ground large differences in the package of rights\nand immunities that being possesses? How can all cognitively normal\nhumans have the same package of rights and immunities despite\ndiffering greatly in the attributes that place them above the\nthreshold? Those who defend the standard concept of moral status need\na moral theory to underwrite its range and threshold features; those\nwho attack it need to deny that any plausible theory could do so. \nThe central question in the debate over the full moral status of human\nbeings with radical cognitive disabilities concerns the type of\nattributes on which moral status is based. Most of those who deny or\nquestion the full moral status of all human beings insist that moral\nstatus must be based exclusively on attributes or properties of the\nindividual; those attributes must be identifiable by a biological or\npsychological inventory of that individual, with no reference to the\nbiological or social environment it inhabits. For example, it would be\npossible to assess an individual’s self-consciousness or\npractical rationality knowing nothing about its fellow creatures\n(although the assessment itself might have to be done by\nself-conscious and practically rational creatures). In contrast, we\ncould not ascertain an individual’s species membership or social\nrelationships without knowing a great deal about the world it\ninhabited. We will call accounts based solely on individual attributes\n“individually-based”; we will label\n“group-based” those accounts based on facts about the\nindividual’s membership in a biological or social group, or her\nrelationship with other members of that group. Those facts may concern\nthe individual’s biological origins, the typical or average\ncharacteristics of a biological or social group to which she belongs,\nor her actual relationships with other individuals. Although some\nindividually-based accounts concern an individual’s capacity or\npotential to form relationships of certain kinds with other\nindividuals, it is that capacity or potential which confers moral\nstatus, not the existence of such relationships. \nThose who insist that moral status must be based on an\nindividual’s own attributes, that it cannot depend on the\naccidents of birth or the vagaries of biological classification, are\nalso likely to insist that an individual’s claims on others\ncannot depend on whether those others happen to be members of the same\nspecies or communities. In this view, full moral status must not only\nbe independent of external circumstances, but must be universally\nrecognized. Although some group-based accounts may require that a\nbeing’s full moral status be universally recognized, others see\nfull moral status as group-relative (see\n Sec. 5.1). \nIn comparing accounts of moral status, it is important to note two\npossible differences between such accounts. First, they may propose\ndifferent conditions as sufficient for full moral status. Some\naccounts, for example, claim that membership in the human species is\nsufficient for that status. Second, they may offer different\nexplanations of how the satisfaction of those conditions grounds or\nwarrants full moral status. For example, even if being a Homo sapiens\nsuffices for possessing full moral status, there may be different\nrationales for why it is sufficient: 1) because it is in the\nnature of Homo sapiens to be rational; 2) because the\nrational nature of the species requires respect for all of its\nmembers, rational or not; or 3) because members of the same species\nhave a duty of partiality to each other, regardless of their\nindividual attributes. Thus, the two accounts ground moral status in\nthe same relational property—membership in the human\nspecies—and they make membership a sufficient condition for full\nmoral status. But they use the fact of species membership differently\nin justifying moral status. They might also associate different rights\nwith full moral status, in accordance with their different ways of\ngrounding it. And, as discussed in\n Sec. 4,\n they may have different implications about who is required to\nrecognize or respect an individual’s status. \nIndividually-based accounts generally take cognitively normal adult\nhuman beings as their paradigm and pick out one or more of their\nattributes as sufficient for the moral status they\n enjoy.[4]\n These accounts identify overlapping clusters of psychological and\ncognitive attributes—self-consciousness, awareness of and\nconcern for oneself as a temporally-extended subject; practical\nrationality, rational agency, or autonomy; moral responsibility; a\ncapacity to recognize other selves and to be motivated to justify\none’s actions to them; the capacity to be held, and hold others,\nmorally accountable. These attributes pick out different subsets of\nhuman beings. Some self-conscious humans, for example, may lack the\ncapacity to be held morally accountable. But individually-based\naccounts may differ less in the range of beings to whom they accord\nfull moral status than in the ways they regard those attributes as\ngrounding that status. \nOne approach holds that psychological attributes confer moral status\nby virtue of the interests to which they give rise. This approach\ntreats psychological attributes as the basis of interests that we have\na prima facie obligation to advance, or at least not to\nthwart—an obligation whose strength varies with the strength and\nother features of those interests. The capacity to feel pain grounds\nan obligation to avoid its infliction; the capacity to anticipate and\ndread as well as feel pain may ground a stronger obligation. But if\nadditional psychological capacities merely increased the strength of\nthe interest, and the corresponding obligation to advance or not\nthwart it, an interest account would not provide a basis for a moral\nstatus threshold (McMahan 2002). \nAn account that accorded interests moral weight in proportion to their\nstrength would not require a notion of moral status, even if beings of\na particular type tended to have stronger interests. Thus,\nphilosophers who account for our differing obligations to beings of\ndifferent species in terms of their unequal interests tend to regard\n“moral status” as an unnecessary or inert notion (Harman,\n2003, 187), or to conclude that all beings with interests (for which\nsentience is often thought necessary) have equal moral status (Rossi,\n2010). This denial of different levels of moral status, however,\nlicenses the unequal treatment of human beings with the most severe\ncognitive impairments if they are assumed to have weaker interests,\nespecially in survival. Thus, it offers cold comfort to defenders of\nthe moral equality of all human beings. \nMore categorical interest-based approaches ground moral status in the\ncapacity to experience oneself as a temporally-extended being whose\nlife can go better or worse (Singer 1993; Tooley 1983) or to value\none’s own existence (Harris 1985; Newson 2007). Individuals\nhaving such capacities can care about and value their future lives in\nways that individuals lacking those capacities cannot, giving them a\nqualitatively weightier interest in those lives (McMahan 2002).\nWhether or not such capacities can account for the threshold and range\nfeatures of full moral status, their adoption as criteria appears to\ndeny that status to human beings with the most significant cognitive\nimpairments. \nA second approach, derived from or inspired by Kant, sees moral status\nin terms of the respect demanded by the possession of one or more\nattributes, such as autonomy or moral responsibility (e.g., Korsgaard\n1996). This approach regards the possession of an autonomous will as\nconferring dignity and demanding respect, so that a being with such a\nwill must not be treated as a mere means, but as an end. This Kantian\nconception of full moral status is often regarded as a paradigm, in\nidentifying an attribute that does not vary\n continuously,[5]\n and whose possession appears to have clear moral implications. The\nthreshold for moral status set by many Kantian accounts is a high one.\nIf those accounts regard the capacity for autonomy as the threshold\nfor full moral status, and if they understand that capacity as\ngrounding moral status in moral responsibility, then since\n“there is nothing for which we would hold human infants or\nseverely cognitively disabled adults morally responsible, it is\nargued, such humans must lack Kantian moral status” (Kain 2009,\n 66).[6]\n Even if humans need not be held morally responsible to enjoy full\nmoral status, many would still lack the capacity for autonomy that\nseems essential on any Kantian account. \nA third approach, associated with contractualism, sees moral status in\nterms of the attributes needed for membership in a moral community, or\nfor participation in relationships of mutual recognition and\n concern.[7]\n It is the capacity for forming such relationships, not their actual\nformation, which grounds full moral status. A cognitively normal human\nbeing would have such status even if he were abandoned on a desert\nisland. This approach, the most clearly symmetrical, treats certain\nattributes as necessary for moral status not because their mere\npossession generates moral obligations, but because they are\nrequisites for the kind of relationships in terms of which the\nproponents of this approach understand moral obligations. This\nrequirement may appear to give cognitive and psychological attributes\na more instrumental role than they are assigned by the second\napproach. It’s not that their mere possession demands respect,\nbut that they enable their possessors to form relationships of which\nmutual respect is an integral part. \nThough relationship-based accounts differ conceptually from\nrespect-based accounts, they differ little in practical terms. They\nwill identify different human beings as having full moral status only\nif humans can have the cognitive or other psychological capacities\nnecessary for respect while lacking the empathy or motivation\nnecessary for membership in a moral community (or vice-versa). For\nexample, a moral-relationship account might exclude psychopaths. But\nso might a respect-based account, if it denied psychopaths autonomy\nbecause they lacked the capacity to be motivated by a sense of duty,\nor more broadly, a capacity to recognize and act on moral reasons (see\nShoemaker 2007). A respect-based account might also exclude\npsychopaths if it attributed their moral deficits to severe\ndisabilities in practical rationality. Relationship-based accounts\nwould, like Kantian ones, appear to set a very high threshold for full\nmoral status. The greater the moral accountability demanded by the\nrelationship, the more difficult it may be to claim that human beings\nwith radical cognitive impairments are capable of participation. \nOne challenge for all of these accounts is to identify an attribute or\nattributes that can explain, or at least be reconciled with, the\nthreshold and range features of the prevailing concept of moral\nstatus. The difficulty presented by a threshold is that it imposes\nmoral discontinuity over psychologically continuous attributes. In\ncontrast to the possession of a soul, for example, practical\nrationality, moral responsibility, and most other individual\nattributes claimed by contemporary accounts to ground moral status,\nappear to come in degrees. Looking at the development of an infant,\nthe acquisition of these attributes appears to be gradual, even if its\npace is uneven. And yet our judgment of moral status appears\ncategorical—an individual either has full moral status or lacks\nit. The categorical character of moral status is also clear above the\nthreshold. We do not think that the more highly intelligent, more\ndeeply self-conscious, or more fully autonomous among us have a higher\nmoral status than the rest, even those near the edge. The challenge of\njustifying this range feature of full moral status is closely related\nto the challenge of justifying the threshold—why should\ndifferences above the threshold be morally insignificant when the\nthreshold itself is so significant? \nIf full moral status is determined by the possession of any of the\ncognitive attributes discussed in the last section, then that status\nwill be enjoyed by some non-human animals and—more\nproblematically—almost certainly lacked by some humans. Most\nproponents of individually-based attribute accounts welcome the\nimplication that we cannot justify existing disparities between our\ntreatment of “higher” animals and cognitively disabled\nhuman beings, and many argue that those disparities are better reduced\nby raising our standards for non-human animals than by lowering them\nfor cognitively disabled humans. \nThe optimal point of convergence … requires that traditional\nbeliefs about animals be more extensively revised than traditional\nviews about the severely retarded. (McMahan 2002, 230) \nBut full convergence, as McMahan recognizes, would have disturbing\nimplications even if it were achieved entirely by upgrading the\ntreatment of nonhuman animals:  \n[T]he preservation of the traditional view [that it is seriously wrong\nto kill an anencephalic infant] will commit us to the conclusion that\nit is seriously wrong to kill an animal that altogether lacks the\ncapacity for consciousness. And this is unacceptable. (2002, 230)  \nConvergence at a significantly lower level would have equally\nunacceptable implications. For example, it would permit the use of\nradically impaired human beings in any research, however harmful, for\nwhich the use of animals with comparable cognitive capacities was\npermitted. Any view about moral status that aspires to reflective\nequilibrium with our deeply held moral convictions must confront the\nabhorrence with which most thoughtful people would regard the\npractical implications of treating humans with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as having even slightly lower moral status than the rest\nof us. \nA variety of approaches seek to address that abhorrence: by\nidentifying criteria for full moral status that include a wider range\nof humanity\n (Sec. 4.1);\n by expanding the ways in which an individual can possess or achieve\nfull moral status without denying the primacy of individual attributes\n (Sec. 4.2);\n and by rejecting individual attribute accounts of moral status\n (Sec. 5). \nSeveral accounts identify attributes, such as the capacity to value or\ncare, that are shared by a greater proportion of human beings than\nself-consciousness, practical rationality, autonomy, or moral\naccountability. These accounts seek to recognize the full and equal\nmoral status of all, or almost all, human beings, including children,\nand of adults with significant cognitive and psychological\ndisabilities. Among the more inclusive criteria proposed are the\ncapacities to communicate, or for minimal communication with other\nhumans (respectively, Berube 1996; Francis and Norman 1978); to value\nor care (Jaworska 1999, 2007); and to give and receive love (Kittay\n1999); to form relationships characterized by reciprocity of care\n(Mullin 2011). Jaworska and Tannenbaum (2016 a, 2016b offer perhaps\nthe most detailed account that grounds moral status in the capacity to\nform morally significant relationships. They maintain that “a\nbeing merits higher moral status” if it has the capacity to\nachieve, through a rearing relationship, “incomplete\nrealizations of activities characteristic of” humans with\ntypical psychological attributes (whom they call “self-standing\npersons” (SSP)) (2016b, 1098). An actual rearing relationship is\nnot necessary, but only beings who can model Characteristic SSP\nactivities have the requisite capacity. This excludes humans\n“capable of rudimentary conscious activity who nonetheless are\nnot yet capable of modeling SSP activities in any form” (2016b,\n1101)—not only early fetuses but children and adults with the\nmost significant cognitive impairments, who will never have that\ncapacity. \nThese accounts are attractive in identifying attributes that may offer\na more intuitively appealing basis for moral status than practical\nrationality or self-awareness, and in reducing, to varying extents,\nthe proportion of humanity excluded from full moral status. But\nbecause they exclude some humans, and may include some non-human\nanimals, they do not fully capture commonsense views about moral\nstatus and will be unacceptable to some philosophers. Moreover, these\nalternative attributes do not resolve, but merely relocate, the\nproblem of accounting for the threshold and range features of full\nmoral status. \nOne attribute—the potential for any other individual\nattribute held to suffice for full moral status—comes much\ncloser to full inclusion (Kumar 2008). But it faces three formidable\nproblems. As Joel Feinberg (1986) famously argued, the fact that\nsomeone has the mere potential for an attribute does not warrant\ntreating him as if he actually possessed it. If potential has moral\nsignificance, it cannot be directly inferred from the moral\nsignificance of that which it actualizes. Further, some human beings\nnever have the potential for any individual attribute held to suffice\nfor full moral status, in any sense of “potential” that\nwould distinguish them from many non-human animals (McMahan 2008,\n91–92). As debates about the moral status of the fetus suggest,\nit is not at all clear when a being has the “potential”\nfor an attribute. The claim that someone has potential is a\ncounterfactual: in some other circumstances, perhaps a later\nlife-stage of the individual, the person would have the attribute.\nThis brings in difficult questions about the scope of such\ncounterfactuals. On a broad enough construal, every living being has\nthe potential to develop the relevant attributes in a sufficiently\ndifferent possible world, and so has full moral\n status.[8]\n  \nMatthew Liao has argued for “the genetic basis for moral\nagency” as a sufficient condition for full moral status that is\nmore plausible and inclusive than a potentiality criterion (Liao\n2010). It accords full moral status to humans who have lost the\npotential for agency, and to radically disabled humans who never had\nsuch potential, in any conventional sense of that term. But it\nincludes these individuals at the cost of including almost all human\nembryos—a cost many would consider excessive. Moreover,\nLiao’s account requires a conceptually difficult, morally\nuncertain distinction between genomes that have and lack “the basis\nfor moral agency” (e.g., Wasserman 2002; McMahan 2002, 2008).\nPotentiality accounts face similar line-drawing problems; the question\nis whether the shift from “potential” to “genetic basis” makes\nthose problems any more tractable. The genetic basis account also\nshares what many would regard as a problem of “over\ninclusiveness”—they confer moral status on early embryos, which\nhave the genetic basis for moral agency, at least as clearly as they\nhave the potential for it. To justify abortion, proponents of either\naccount must rely on a woman’s right to withdraw gestational\naid. \nThese challenges are inherited by two accounts that seek to base moral\nstatus on the possession of a “modal property.” Shelley Kagan\n(2016) and Jonathan Surovell (forthcoming) argue that beings who had,\nor could have had, the psychological capacities of typical human\nbeings are their moral equals. According to both accounts, human\nbeings who lost, or never had, those capacities due to illness or\nimpairment still have the modal property that they could have had\nthem, and this property confers full moral status. That property is\nnot possessed by members of most other species, who could only have\nacquired those capacities in quite distant possible worlds. As\nSurovell puts it, “[d]isability but not species membership is a\nmatter of luck” (21). \nThese accounts face much the same challenge as Liao’s, of\ndetermining whether a given being “could have” developed the\npsychological capacities of human beings when their failure to do so\nresults from genetic differences. They also face the challenge posed\nby members of other species capable of identity-preserving cognitive\nupgrades (DeGrazia, 2016; McMahan, 2016). But perhaps the strongest\nobjection to grounding moral status in modal properties is raised by\nDeGrazia: even if human beings with profound cognitive impairments are\naptly characterized as victims of bad luck, why does their victimhood\nconfer moral status? Surely that status cannot be justified as a\nconsolation prize for a near miss. While this objection does not\ndirectly apply to the genetic-basis account, that account faces the\nquestion of why the biological basis for morally significant\nattributes itself has moral significance. \nA second general way of accommodating the powerful intuitions about\nthe full moral status of all human beings is to recognize alternatives\nto the actual possession of the status-conferring attributes. One\nversion of this approach treats human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities as, in effect, capable of acquiring the necessary\nattributes by proxy, through their relationships with other human\nbeings. Thomas Scanlon (1998), for example, affirms the full moral\nstatus of all human beings while basing full moral status (“the\nrequirement of justifiability”) on the individual capacity for\n“judgment-sensitive” attitudes. Although he recognizes\nthat radically-impaired humans lack those attributes, he suggests that\nthey can acquire them vicariously, through trustees: \nThe tie of birth gives us good reason to want to treat [human beings\nlacking the capacity for judgment-sensitive attitudes] “as\nhumans” despite their limited capacities. Because of these\nlimitations, the idea of justifiability to them must be understood\ncounterfactually, in terms of what they could reasonably reject if\nthey were able to understand such a question. This makes the idea of\ntrusteeship appropriate in their case, whether it is appropriate in\nthe case of nonhuman animals or not. It also indicates a basis on\nwhich such a trustee could object to proposed principles. Severely\ndisabled humans have reason to want those things that any human being\nhas reason to want, insofar as those are things that they are capable\nof benefiting from. (185–186) \nScanlon himself may understand trusteeship merely as a way of\nrealizing or respecting the full moral status of human beings with\nradical impairments, a status that is based on “the ties of\nbirth.” Other philosophers, however, suggest that trusteeship\ncan secure full moral status by helping to satisfy criteria that could\nnot otherwise be met. Thus, Francis and Silvers (Francis 2009; Silvers\nand Francis 2009) argue that cognitively normal human beings can\nfunction as “mental prostheses” for radically impaired\nones: \n[A]s a prosthetic arm or leg executes some of the functions of a\nmissing fleshly limb without being confused with or supplanting the\nusual fleshly limb, so, we propose, a trustee’s reasoning and\ncommunicating can execute part or all of a subject’s own\nthinking processes without substituting the trustee’s ideas as\nif it were the subject’s own. (485) \nFor example, trustees can help the subject fashion her own conception\nof the good by carefully eliciting and extrapolating her attitudes and\npreferences. \nFrancis and Silvers do not claim that the moral status of human beings\nwith the most significant cognitive impairments could rest on such\ntrusteeship, or on the potential for it. But it is useful to consider\ntwo challenges facing their proposal, which they acknowledge. The\nfirst is the question of authorship or authenticity: It is not clear\nhow a trustee’s reasoning could be said to “execute”\nall, as opposed to part, of “a subject’s own\nthinking.” It is not clear how the thinking can be the\nsubject’s if it was wholly executed by a trustee (Wasserman and\nMcMahan, 2012). The second challenge, shared by the notion of mental\nprostheses and Scanlon’s notion of the vicarious expression of\njudgment-sensitive attitudes, is the possibility of providing such\nsupport for nonhuman animals—a possibility Scanlon leaves open\nin the above passage. If it could be extended to animals, the\npotential for such representation would ground the full moral status\nof vast numbers of primates and other mammals. To close the\nfloodgates, it would seem necessary to argue that this support was\nless feasible for intelligent animals, even domesticated ones, than it\nwas for radically impaired human beings. Clearly, an argument would be\nneeded that, in Francis and Silvers’ terms, it would be far more\ndifficult to fashion a mental prosthesis for the former. \nA proxy approach also raises the difficult question of how the trustee\ncan acquire the moral and epistemic authority to speak for an\nindividual with radical cognitive disabilities. Legal systems assign\ntrustees or guardians to represent the “best interests” of\nindividuals too immature or impaired to make, or to have made, their\nown judgments. But it is not clear how someone gets\n“appointed” as a trustee for purposes of securing moral\nstatus. Moreover, even those closest and most committed to an\nindividual with radical cognitive impairments may find it hard to\ndiscern his interests, and distinguish them from their own\n“judgment-sensitive” attitudes. \nAnother way of accommodating strong convictions about the full moral\nstatus of all human beings grounds that status in actual relationships\nbetween cognitively normal and radically-disabled human beings.\nBecause of their duties of partiality, the close relatives of\nradically impaired individuals must treat them as if they had full\nmoral status. This could be regarded as an agent-relative status: for\nclose relatives and no one else, radically disabled humans actually\nhave full moral status. But because of the full moral status of those\nclose relatives, other human beings must respect their duty to regard\ntheir disabled kin as full moral equals. They do not, however, have to\nassume that duty themselves. Some proponents of individual-attribute\naccounts—McMahan, for example—appear to take this view. In\ncontrast, some of the group-based accounts in the next section hold\nthat the “tie of birth” requires all cognitively\nnondisabled human beings to accord full moral status to\nradically-impaired human beings, regardless of their relationship. A\nweaker version of this derivative or courtesy position does not claim\nthat a human being with radical cognitive disabilities actually has\nfull moral status even for close family members, merely that they must\ntreat her as if she did. This reduces somewhat (but does not\neliminate) the disparity between family members and third parties, but\nonly by downgrading the moral status of radically-impaired humans even\nfor their most significant others. \nFor some philosophers, either version of this view is unsatisfactory,\nfor two related reasons. First, it is too narrow, since it does not\noffer radically impaired human beings complete moral equality. Only a\nsmall subset of other humans need to treat them as moral equals; the\nrest merely need to respect this special relationship. Second, it is\ntoo contingent—a human with radical cognitive impairments owes\neven his partial equality to the existence of close relationships. If\nhis parents and other relatives abandon him or die, he has only a very\ntenuous claim to being treated by the rest of humanity any better than\na non-human animal with similar attributes. \nWe would suggest yet another “evidentiary” approach to\naccommodating the conviction that every human being has full moral\nstatus, one that calls for the adoption of a strong, even\n“irrebuttable” presumption of full moral status for all\nhuman beings. This approach is based on the difficulty of assessing\nthe cognitive potential of human beings, the powerful tendency to\nunderestimate the capacity and potential of human beings with any\ndegree of cognitive abnormality, and the terrible cost to individuals\nwho warrant but are denied full moral status. This approach can be\nregarded as rule-consequentialist, in requiring that we sometimes\ndisregard our case-specific judgment because of the high probability\nand substantial costs of error. But it may appeal to many who reject\nrule-consequentialism as a general approach. At the same time, this\nrationale for full moral status may seem uncomfortably grudging and\ncontingent. It appears to imply that, with sufficiently accurate\nassessment tools and sufficiently reliable assessors, we could deny\nmoral status to many human beings whom we now are constrained to treat\nas having it. Moreover, their exclusion would represent moral\nprogress. \nSuch a presumption of full moral status for humans with radical\ncognitive disabilities could be given a more robust justification.\nThat justification would treat biological differences, species norms,\nor “ties of birth” not as providing independent grounds\nfor full moral status, but as providing very strong reasons for\npresuming it. Perhaps part of the reason we presume this is epistemic,\nbecause it is so difficult to conclude that individuals who look human\nreally lack human capacities. But that is not the whole explanation.\nWhen cognitively nondisabled humans encounter another being with human\nappearance, they customarily respond to that being in ways they do not\nto non-human animals; they use distinctive gestures, facial\nexpression, touch, speech, and other behavior. Such responses assume a\ncapacity for reciprocal exchange that may not always be present. But\neven when it is not, those responses are not idle gestures. They may\nenable communication, and provoke cognitive and social development,\nthat would otherwise not occur. Family members, friends,\nprofessionals, and scholars who work with people who have cognitive\ndisabilities report that the more time they spend with individuals who\ninitially seemed unable to communicate or respond meaningfully, the\nmore they could discern about their interests, desires, and moods\n(Brown and Gothelf 1996; Goode 1994). Indeed, those people often\ndisplay species-typical preferences in clothing, food, socializing,\nand other activities. In sustained interaction with nondisabled humans\nwho treat them as members of the same moral community, cognitively\ndisabled individuals develop socially and psychologically along the\nlines of other human beings. Treating people with cognitive\ndisabilities as if they had potential for typically human feelings,\ndesires and responses, then, can thus become self-fulfilling. This\napproach offers a pragmatic (and consequentialist) justification for\npresuming that all human beings have full moral status: not merely\nbecause of the terrible costs of mistakenly denying that status, but\nbecause treating fellow human beings as capable of joining our moral\ncommunity makes it more likely that they will be able to do so. \nThis proposal does not claim that such treatment could never be\neffective if directed toward a dolphin or chimpanzee. But we have\nstronger reasons to treat our fellow human beings this way, however\nsignificant their cognitive disabilities. Our shared embodiment and\ngenetic endowment facilitate our treating them as having the capacity\nor potential for typical human interaction and activity, and make it\nlikely that they will be more responsive to our treatment than a\nnon-human animal with similar cognitive abilities. Other intelligent\nbeings, differently embodied than we are, would have the same reasons\nto treat their fellow beings this way. In recognizing such a\nlimited partiality, we do not treat species as having a moral\nsignificance akin to that of families or even nations. Nor, clearly,\ndo we assume that human beings in particular have special moral\nstatus. \nDespite its resolute optimism, this proposal still excludes some human\nbeings from full moral status. It assumes a minimum level of social\nresponsiveness which is almost certainly lacking in human beings with\nanencephaly, and perhaps lacking in human beings with other radical\ncognitive impairments. Yet in its pragmatic justification of a limited\npartiality towards members of the same species, it sets the stage for\nviews that give a more central role to species membership. \nA number of philosophers have argued for the full moral status of all\nhuman beings, without seeking to identify any attribute possessed by\nall humans that would ground that status. These philosophers can be\nroughly divided into two groups. Those in the first group regard\nmembership in the species Homo sapiens as sufficient for full\nmoral status and ground that status in a species-based attribute (See\n Sec. 5.1).\n For some philosophers within this first group, all homo sapiens\nbelong to a kind whose nature or norm it is to possess rationality or\nsimilar attributes\n (Sec. 5.1.1).\n For others, all homo sapiens are connected through “ties of\nbirth” to other human beings\n (Sec. 5.1.2).\n For the former, any being of a kind whose nature it is to be\nrational, etc. has full moral status; for the latter, any human\nrelated by birth to other human beings has full moral status. Although\nthe two approaches pick out the same individual human beings, the way\nin which they ground moral status gives them different implications\nfor the status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments. \nThe former way of grounding moral status gives it a wider\n“writ,” because the individual’s moral status is not\nbased on his relationship to specific others. Rather, it is based on\nthe norm of a group to which she belongs. That norm demands\nrecognition by anyone, whether a member of the group or not, capable\nof recognizing it. If human beings with radical cognitive impairments\nhave full moral status by virtue of belonging to a group with the norm\nof rationality, a rational Martian, no less than a rational human,\nshould recognize the full moral status of humans with those\nimpairments. It might be possible to argue that the morally-relevant\nnorms of a group are not binding on those outside the group, but we\nhave not seen such an argument. \nIn contrast, ties of birth may not bind those lacking the same\nbiological connection; members of other species need not recognize the\nfull moral status of human beings with radical cognitive impairments.\nIn that sense, the moral status of those human beings is not as\n“full” as that of other human beings, since it must be\nrecognized only by other humans. If full moral status is based on\nduties of partiality toward members of the same group, it will be\ngroup-relative, not binding on members of other groups. \nThe second type of group-based account\n (Sec. 5.2)\n acknowledges the moral significance of the group-based attributes\nrelied on by the first type of group-based accounts. But it denies\nthat the full and equal moral status of human beings can be grounded\nin any specific attribute, even indirectly, that can be described in\nmorally neutral terms. These accounts regard “human being”\nas a thick normative concept, grounded in language and social\npractice, that is not necessarily coextensive with the biological\ncategory of “Homo sapiens,” and that has moral content\nthat cannot be derived from any descriptive attribute associated with\nit. The judgment that a being is human and therefore must be treated\nrespectfully does not consist of a value-neutral biological\nclassification and an argument that establishes the moral status of\nbeings so classified. The requirement for certain kinds of treatment,\nand the prohibition of others, is part of the meaning of “human\nbeing” and implicit in the recognition that a given individual\nis a human\n being.[9]\n Proponents of these accounts thus reject the very attempt to identify\na criterial attribute possessed by all beings with the moral status of\ncognitively normal human adults (Diamond 1978; Edwards 1997; Byrne\n2000). These philosophers reject the treatment of cognitively\nnondisabled adults as a paradigm for full moral status, and of\ninfants, young children, and radically cognitively disabled adults as\n“marginal cases” whose moral status needs to be justified\nby\n extension.[10] \nFor both types of group-based accounts, the categorical nature of full\nmoral status is explained by the way in which that status is grounded.\nMembership in the human species, a sufficient condition of that status\nfor accounts of both types, is a categorical rather than a continuous\n“variable” (although there may be some vagueness or\nambiguity due to imprecise or conflicting membership criteria). And\nfor both types of account, the grounding of full moral status is the\nsame for all human beings, regardless of their individual\nattributes. \nOn the first relational approach, some of the properties identified by\nintrinsic-attribute accounts as sufficient for full moral status can\nalso play a distinct role in attaining it. Although, on this view,\nself-consciousness and practical rationality are not necessary for\nfull moral status, they are the norm for human beings. This norm\ncannot be understood statistically; it would not change if most or all\nhumans ceased to be self-conscious or practically rational. Rather,\nthe norm captures what is characteristic of the species. A normal\nattribute is not, however, an essence that each member must possess.\nRather, it is a relational property: each individual has moral status\nas the member of a group for which that attribute is the norm.\nScanlon, for example, claims that the class of those to whom we must\njustify our actions “includes at least those beings who are of a\nkind that is normally capable of judgment-sensitive attitudes”\n(1998, 186). \nSpecies-norm accounts focus on the human species, but they are not\nlimited to humans. Presumably, if we discovered that dolphins or\nMartians were a species with a similar cognitive norm, members of that\nspecies would possess full moral status whether or not they satisfied\nthat norm. We would be bound to recognize (if they could) the full\nmoral status of all dolphins or Martians, and they would be bound to\nrecognize the full moral status of all humans. \nThere may appear to be a tension in grounding full and equal moral\nstatus in norms to which some but not all members conform. Even if the\nnorm of practical rationality gives all group members equal moral\nstatus, it might seem that those members actually possessing that\nattribute would be “more equal” than those lacking it. The\nresponse to this concern, which we discuss in\n Sec. 5.2,\n is that those possessing the attribute have better fortune but no\ngreater moral status. \nNot surprisingly, proponents of intrinsic attribute accounts, such as\nMcMahan, are unsympathetic with the claim that “facts about the\nnature of some individuals could determine how other individuals that\nlack that nature ought to be treated” (McMahan 2008, 85). Like\nother critics, McMahan sees this claim as requiring a kind of\n“moral alchemy” that transmutes factual claims about some\nindividuals into moral demands concerning others. But for those who\nregard humanity as a “thick” concept\n (5.2),\n no alchemy is required. The concept of a human being is a normative\none, conferring rights on all those who fall under it and imposing\nmoral demands on those who understand and apply it. \nA second kind of species-relationship claimed to confer moral status\nis not between the individual human and the species norm, but between\nthe individual human and other human beings, in particular, those who\nare cognitively normal. The claim is that human beings have a reason,\nbased on co-membership in the species, to regard each other as moral\nequals. As Scanlon (1998) asserts, \n[T]he mere fact that a being is ‘of human born’ provides a\nstrong reason for according it the same status as other humans. This\nhas sometimes been characterized as prejudice, called speciesism. But\nit is not prejudice to hold that our own relation to these beings\ngives us reason to accept the requirement that our actions be\njustifiable to them. (185)  \nThis position grounds full moral status in the kinship of all human\nbeings—what used to be called “the family of man.”\nAlthough this kinship currently depends on birth to a human mother, it\nis shared by all human beings and does not vary with degree of\n consanguinity.[11] \nThis approach avoids the questionable notion of a species norm as a\nsource of moral status. But unlike a species-norm account, it requires\nno one but human beings to recognize the full moral status of all\nhumans. On the species norm account, McMahan (2002) observes,  \n[I]ntelligent and morally sensitive Martians would be required to\ntreat severely retarded human beings in the same way they would be\nrequired to treat us. … But if the reason we have to accord the\nseverely retarded the same moral status as other human beings is that\nwe are related to them through the ‘tie of birth,’ then\nMartians would not have this reason. (217)  \nThis is a practically insignificant limitation at present, but an\nexpressively significant one for those who insist that moral status be\nuniversally recognized. \nA defender of a human kinship approach might readily accept this\nlimitation, especially since we and the Martians would still be\nconstrained by the attachments of the cognitively normal members of\nthe other species to their radically impaired relations (as discussed\nin\n Sec. 4.2\n above). But she would still have to defend the claim that\nco-membership in the species established the sort of kinship that\nrequired even this species-relative full moral status. McMahan (2002)\nargues that even if membership in some groups, like nations, could\nconfer full and equal status on its members, membership in the same\nspecies could not: \nUnlike membership in a nation, membership in a species is not a focus\nof collective identity. Being human does not significantly\ndifferentiate us from anything else; it therefore fails to engage our\npride or enhance our sense of identity. Just as no one’s sense\nof identity is enlarged by the recognition that one is an animal\nrather than a plant, so no one’s sense of identity is\nimportantly shaped by an awareness of being human rather than being,\nfor example, a rabbit. (221) \nThe defender of a “ties of birth” account could respond in\ntwo ways. First, she might deny that species identity and pride were\nnecessary to ground the full moral status of species members. Rather,\nthat status was grounded in similarities among human beings, even\nradically disabled ones, that arose from their distinctive embodiment\nand that created a strong sense of fellowship (among those\nself-conscious enough to feel fellowship) overshadowing even vast\ndifferences in mental capacity. These similarities include ways of\nfeeling, communicating, moving, and reacting to and interacting with\nother members of the species. These affinities are refracted by\nculture, members of other species share some of them, and not all\nmembers of the species—even cognitively normal ones—share\nall of them. Nevertheless, they may be a distinctive enough ensemble\nto provide a basis for partiality. Or a defender might argue, as\nBernard Williams (2006) does (see\n Sec. 5.2),\n that species-identity and pride could play a role in human\nfellowship now obscured by the lack of a suitable comparison class.\nAlthough, as Robert Nozick (1974) observed, no contemporary human\nboasts about having an opposable thumb or speaking a language, our\nsense of species pride and identity might crystallize in the presence\nof another advanced species, which would highlight our distinctive\nshared history and achievements. \nStanding alone, however, both responses seem vulnerable to the claim\nthat similarities associated with species membership may explain, but\ncannot justify, the treatment of all other human beings as moral\nequals. Why should a sense of fellowship, however strong, be a source\nof moral status? If our sense of fellowship reflected what mattered\nmorally, why wouldn’t we feel greater fellowship with\nMcMahan’s intelligent, morally sensitive Martian than with a\nhuman infant whose developmental disabilities make him apparently\nunresponsive to other humans? \nOne response is that what justifies intra-species partiality is not\nthe capacity to share but the capacity to benefit. Thus, Gunnarson\n(2008) suggests that members of our own species have a capacity to\nderive unique, intrinsic benefits from their relationship to other\nhuman beings. Reliance on such a capacity may provide an intuitively\nmore appealing basis for full moral status than biologically-based\nsimilarities. But it might still deny full moral status to some\nhumans—not only anencephalic infants but others lacking the\ncapacity to benefit from relations with other humans. Moreover, some\nnon-human animals, especially domesticated ones, may derive immense\nbenefits that are intrinsic and unique to their relationship to humans\n(Townley 2010). And the members of other cognitively advanced species\nmight well benefit in highly specific, possibly unique ways, from\ninteraction with human beings. \nTo explain the moral significance of species co-membership, some\nphilosophers embrace a strongly anthropocentric view, which denies\nthat we can step outside of our humanity to assess the moral status of\nthe world’s inhabitants. On this view, the concept of a human\nbeing is prior to, and inseparable from, that of a\n person.[12]\n As Stephen Mulhall (2002) argues: \n[O]ur concept of a person is an outgrowth or aspect of our concept of\na human being; and that concept is not merely biological but rather a\ncrystallisation of everything we have made of our distinctive species\nnature. To see another as a human being is to see her as a\nfellow-creature—another being whose embodiment embeds her in a\ndistinctive form of common life with language and culture, and whose\nexistence constitutes a particular kind of claim on us. (7) \nThis view, which, following Williams (2006), we will call\n“humanist,” has two variants. The first, per Mulhall, is\nlinguistic or conceptual, influenced by Wittgenstein (1958). We come\nto understand notions like thinking, deciding, and feeling in terms of\nthe behavior of other human beings, and, although we can attribute\nsome of these capacities or states to other beings, it is only by\nextension or analogy (Hanfling 2001). We also learn the appropriate\nways of acting toward fellow human beings in learning the very\nconcept: for example, human beings are to be named, and not eaten even\nwhen they are dead. We do not conclude that human beings must\nbe treated this way; the recognition that they must is already part of\nthe meaning of the concept (Diamond 1978; Gleeson\n 2008).[13]\n This “thick” concept of human being is not a biological\none, and need not have the same extension as the class of Homo\n sapiens[14].\n For some humanists of this type, a newly-created embryo is not a\nhuman being, and it is not part of the meaning of human being that the\nlife of a newly-fertilized embryo must be protected to the same extent\nas the life of a newborn human infant (Crary 2007). But the very fact\nthat other humanists do regard early embryos as human beings\nsuggests the need for an account of how such a deeply-embedded concept\ncan be so vague or debatable at the margins. \nBecause of the role of our language and concepts in our moral\nunderstanding, the justification and criticism of our moral practices\ncan only be internal to them, on humanist accounts. As Byrne\nmaintains, \nreason operates in ethics properly when it functions immanently.\nOffering a sound moral argument in criticism of any one of our moral\npractices would be a matter of drawing upon insight from some other\npart of our moral life. (2000, 70–71) \nThe case against eating animals, for example, cannot be made by citing\nattributes they share with us, but only by exposing tensions or\ncontradictions with our other practices (Diamond 1978). Presumably,\nsimilar but more acute tensions would confront any view of humanity\nthat excluded some biological human beings or denied some of them full\nmoral status, making racism and sexism untenable without placing any\npressure on the concept of humanity itself. \nThe second variant denies the possibility of an impartial basis for\nassessing moral status. To attempt to grade or evaluate the\nworld’s inhabitants in absolute terms is to treat the universe\nas having a point of view—the perspective of a deity or a\nutilitarian Ideal Observer (Williams 2006). Without such a vantage\npoint, human beings can judge the rest of the world only in terms of\ntheir own concerns, values and civilization. Indeed, it is only in\nthose terms that we value those characteristics, like rationality and\nself-consciousness, regarded by individual-attribute theorists as\ncriteria for full moral status (Grau, 2016). Our humanity thus gives\nus an indispensable frame of reference for evaluating the rest of the\nworld. It also grounds a defensible partiality toward each other that\nhas little in common with racism or sexism. Not only do almost all of\nus accept naked appeals to the humanity of another being, as opposed\nto her sex or race, as the basis for action or restraint, we appeal to\nhumanity in rejecting racism and sexism. Naked appeals to race or sex,\nunsupported by claims about morally relevant attributes, are rarely\nmade by the most unapologetic racist or sexist. The “human\nprejudice” is more akin to the affinity and loyalty of\nparticipants in a shared culture. If it is difficult to see “the\nhuman prejudice” this way, it may be because “[h]uman\nbeings do not have to deal with any other creature that, in terms of\nargument, principle, worldview, or whatever, can answer back”\n(Williams 2006, 148). A distinctively human “culture” is\nboth pervasive and barely visible in a world that offers no rivals.\nWilliams does not claim that our commitment to that culture would\nnecessarily trump an appeal to participate in a more advanced\nuniversal community and relinquish cherished but parochial aspects of\nour own culture. Nevertheless, that commitment would give us a morally\ndefensible reason, not just a prejudice, against such\nassimilation. \nHumanist accounts recognize that species norms have moral\nsignificance, but they do not assign them the criterial role they play\nin accounts that ground moral status in relational attributes. In the\npassage from which we quoted earlier, Mulhall regards radically\ndisabled humans as suffering a grave misfortune in lacking\ncharacteristically human capacities: \nWe do not strive (when we do strive) to treat human infants and\nchildren, the senile and the severely disabled as fully human because\nwe mistakenly attribute capacities to them that they lack, or because\nwe are blind to the merely biological significance of a species\nboundary. We do it (when we do) because they are fellow human beings,\nembodied creatures who will come to share, or have already shared, in\nour common life, or whose inability to do so is a result of the shocks\nand ills to which all human flesh and blood is heir—because\nthere but for the grace of God go I. (Mulhall 2002, 7) \nFor a humanist like Mulhall, the capacity to participate in\ndistinctively human forms of life is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor full moral status (as McMahan (2005) appears to assume). That\nstatus is established merely by our recognition of an individual as a\nhuman being, heir to the same “shocks and ills” as we are.\nHuman beings with radical cognitive disabilities suffer “grave\nmisfortune,” not reduced status if they are unable to share in\nthe distinctive forms of our common life in which their embodiment has\n“embedded” them. Non-human animals with similar attributes\nhave lower moral status but suffer no comparable estrangement or loss.\nTheir participation in their own species’ distinctive forms of\nlife—if there are any—does not depend upon, and might well\nbe impaired by, their possession of the cognitive attributes of normal\nadult humans.  \nA critic might concede that we in fact hold these divergent attitudes\ntoward humans and non-human animals but would question their moral\nsignificance: why should we regard the congenital absence of certain\ncapacities as a tragedy for the individual lacking them if\nand only if that individual is human (McMahan 1996)? A humanist would\nrespond that the question itself reveals that the critic simply is not\nclear on the concept of “human being”—a concept that\nincludes the notion of a common life, based on shared embodiment, from\nwhich radically impaired humans are excluded. \nHumanists are wary of grounding the full moral status of\nradically-impaired humans in their relationship to a species-norm like\nrationality. Thus, Byrne (2000) argues that appeal to the rational\nnature of human beings as the basis for respect is too reliant on\nexternal justification and too narrow. It is too reliant on claims\nabout the respect owed to beings that are rational-by-nature, which\nByrne doubts are any more self-evident or plausible than claims about\nthe respect owed human beings. It is too narrow because it ignores\nother aspects of humanity that make the concept of “human\nbeing” so rich and powerful. \nThe position of humanists on the species-relativity of moral status is\nuncertain. Given the critical role they assign to “the\ndistinctive form of common life” of human beings for moral\nrecognition and obligation, it is not obvious that Mulhall or Diamond\nwould require an intelligent Martian to recognize and respect the\nmoral status of cognitively normal human beings, let alone of human\nbeings with radical cognitive impairments. Indeed, it is not clear how\nhumans could confidently impute intelligence to Martians if their\nembodiment was sufficiently different from ours, let alone whether we\ncould regard them as subject to moral obligations of any kind.\nSimilarly, it is not clear whether Mulhall and Diamond would hold that\nhumans were required to treat Martians as moral equals, even if they\ncould attribute intelligence and moral sensitivity to them. The role\nthey assign to distinctively human forms of life raises doubts about\nthe possibility of mutual comprehension, recognition, and respect. \nIn contrast, Williams’ account, and others less wedded to a\nWittgenstinian view of language and concepts, can more readily address\nthe prospect of close encounters with other intelligent beings.\nWilliams himself considers such encounters, and acknowledges the\npossibility of mutual recognition, though he thinks it might be\nreasonably qualified by partiality towards the members of one’s\nown species and its culture. \nThese two humanist accounts leave critical questions about the\nboundaries of the thick concept of “human being.” Does\nthat concept encompass early embryos, or human-like beings produced by\na future synthetic biology? Can we answer such questions in terms of\nthe “fit” of a proposed boundary with the other beliefs\nand practices associated with the concept, or are such questions\ndecided less self-consciously by gradual shifts in our actual\npractices? Without a better sense of how boundary questions can be\nresolved, it is not clear how humanist accounts will meet the\nchallenges of exclusion. \nThere seems to be little prospect for consensus on the moral status of\npeople with the most severe cognitive disabilities. There are sharp\ndisagreements about how, or even whether, the moral status of humans\ncan be grounded, and about the weight to be given our strongest and\nmost considered, moral convictions. Accounts that ground full moral\nstatus in an individual’s possession of psychological attributes\ninevitably exclude some portion of humanity, and appear to have\nimplications for the treatment of the excluded human beings that few\nof us are willing to accept. Those implications are avoided by\naccounts that ground full moral status in our species\nmembership—in the nature of the species or in our biological\nrelationships to other members. Those implications are also avoided by\naccounts that deny the need to ground the moral status of human beings\nin any attribute we or our group possesses. But these ways of avoiding\nexclusion have significant costs. They require a strong partiality\ntoward those with shared biological features, physical appearances, or\norigins, a partiality that conflicts with equally strong, if more\nabstract convictions about the justification for our conduct towards\nothers. And they leave deep uncertainty about the moral constraints on\nour treatment of other living beings and about the boundaries of\nhumanity itself. \nDespite the serious challenges facing both approaches, and the\nformidable obstacles to reaching any sort of consensus, the discussion\nabout the moral status of human beings with radical cognitive\ndisabilities is a central one for applied ethics. It needs to\ncontinue.","contact.mail":"daniel.m.putnam@dartmouth.edu","contact.domain":"dartmouth.edu"}]
