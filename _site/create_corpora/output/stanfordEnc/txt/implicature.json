Implicatures can be determined by sentence meaning or by\nconversational context, and can be conventional (in different senses)\nor unconventional. Figures of speech such as metaphor and irony\nprovide familiar examples, as do loose use and damning with faint\npraise. Implicature serves a variety of goals: communication,\nmaintaining good social relations, misleading without lying, style,\nand verbal efficiency. Knowledge of common forms of implicature is\nacquired along with one’s native language.\n\n\nConversational implicatures have become one of the principal subjects\nof pragmatics. An important conceptual and methodological issue in\nsemantics is how to distinguish senses and entailments from\ngeneralized conversational implicatures. A related issue is the degree\nto which sentence meaning determines what is said. Historical\nlinguistics traces the evolution of conversational implicatures into\nidioms.\n\n\nH. P. Grice developed an influential theory to explain and predict\nconversational implicatures, and describe how they arise and are\nunderstood. The Cooperative Principle and associated maxims play a\ncentral role. Neo-Gricean theories modify Grice’s principles to\nsome extent, and Relevance theories replace them with a principle of\ncommunicative efficiency. Problems for such principle-based theories\ninclude overgeneration, lack of determinacy, clashes, and the fact\nthat speakers often have other goals. An alternative approach\nemphasizes that implicatures can be explained and predicted in all the\nways intentions and conventions can be.\n\nH. P. Grice (1913–1988) was the first to systematically study\ncases in which what a speaker means differs from what the\nsentence used by the speaker means. Consider (1). \nIf this was a typical exchange, Barb meant that she is not\ngoing to Paul’s party by saying that she has to work.\nShe did not say that she is not going to Paul’s party, and the\nsentence she uttered does not mean that. Grice introduced the\ntechnical terms implicate and implicature for the\ncase in which what the speaker said is distinct from what the speaker\nthereby meant or\n implied.[1]\n Thus Barb implicated that she is not going; that she is not going was\nher implicature. \nIn (2), Carla is a dispatcher in Denver, where it is sunny and dry.\nDon is a truck driver trying to get over the continental divide during\na blizzard. \nDon is using irony. He said that the weather is lovely, but he thereby\nmeant that the weather is terrible. So he implicated that the weather\nis terrible. Implicating is an illocutionary speech act,\nsomething done in or by uttering words (Austin 1962: 98–103).\nSince it involves meaning one thing by saying something else,\nit is an indirect speech act, albeit not one that Searle\n(1975: 265–6)\n analyzed.[2] \nBy “saying”, Grice meant not the mere utterance of words,\nbut saying that something is the case, another illocutionary\nspeech act. Barb could have said the same thing by uttering different\nwords. As Grice realized, “say” is used more or less\n strictly.[3]\n Thus if Ed says “The largest planet is a gas giant”, we\nwill sometimes count him as saying that Jupiter is a gas giant. We\nwill follow Grice in using “say” more narrowly, requiring\nthat what a speaker says be something that the sentence uttered\nconventionally means (except when an indexical or ellipsis is\n used).\n So we will take Ed to have implicated that Jupiter is a gas giant by\nsaying that the largest planet is. Stating or\nasserting that p entails both saying and meaning that\n p.[4]\n When Yogi Berra, famous for his malapropisms, said “Texas has a\nlot of electrical votes”, he said that Texas has a lot of\nelectrical votes; but since that was not something he meant, it was\nnot something he asserted. Don did not mean what he said for a\ndifferent reason. So he too said but did not assert that the weather\nis lovely. \nIt is not possible to fully understand speakers without knowing what\nthey have implicated as well as what they have said. Unless we know\nwhat Barb meant by saying that she has to work, we will not know that\nshe has answered Alan’s question. Unless Carla knows what Don\nmeant by saying that the weather is lovely, she might mistakenly infer\nthat he will arrive on time. The difference between saying and\nimplicating also affects how we evaluate speakers. If Barb knew she\ndid not have to work, then she was lying in dialogue\n (1).\n If she knew she was going to Paul’s party, she might be guilty\nof misleading Alan, but not of lying or making a false\n statement.[5]\n In court, witnesses are typically required to answer questions\ndirectly. They cannot avoid perjury by implicating a falsehood rather\nthan saying it. \nWhat someone implicates is not given to us directly. We have to\ninfer it from evidence. We would typically infer in\n (1)\n that Barb meant she is not going from what she said, what Alan asked,\nand our assumption that Barb was responding to Alan’s question.\nAn implicature can be characterized as an inference (“something\ninferred”), but implicating is not itself inferring. To\nimplicate something is to express a belief in a particular way. To\ninfer something is to acquire or possess a belief in a particular way.\nHearers have to infer what speakers implicate. This is not what makes\nimplicating an indirect speech act. Implicature is indirect\nbecause to implicate something is to mean it by saying\nsomething else. Even though it requires an inference, our\nrecognition of what is meant is commonly automatic and effortless,\nwhether it is said or implicated. In\n (1),\n for example, competent speakers will grasp immediately that Barb\nmeant both that she has to work and that she is not going to\nPaul’s party. All speech acts have to be inferred from\ncontextual evidence, including what was said and what words were\nuttered. Whether there is any significant difference in the kind of\ninference required to recognize an implicature is a matter of some\ndebate, and may depend on the type of\n implicature.[6] \nThe implicatures in\n (1)\n and\n (2)\n are conversational. They depend on features of the\nconversational context, and are not determined by the conventional\nmeaning of the sentences uttered. A key feature in (1) was\nAlan’s question. Had he asked “What are you going to do\ntoday?”, Barb could have implicated something completely\ndifferent (that she is going to work) by saying the same thing (that she has to work). Grice (1975: 25) contrasted a conversational\nimplicature with a conventional implicature, by which he\nmeant one that is determined by the meaning of the sentence\n used.[7]\n Here’s a variant of Grice’s example. \nWe will use parentheses to refer to the sentences in an example like\n(3), and brackets to refer to what the sentences express. So (3c) is\nthe sentence “Being brave follows from being English” and\n[3c] is the proposition that being brave follows from being English.\nBy using (3a) to say and mean [3a], speakers implicate [3c]. That is,\nby using (3a) to say and mean that the queen is English and therefore\nbrave, speakers implicate that being brave follows from being English.\nThey imply rather than say that being brave follows\nfrom being English. In contrast, (3b) would rarely if ever be used to\nimplicate [3c]. The meaning of “therefore” generates the\nimplicature of (3a). Other words “triggering” conventional\nimplicatures are but, even, too, still, yet, already, again, stop,\nstart, know, and\n regret.[8] \nWhile Grice’s examples were triggered lexically, other\nconventional implicatures are triggered syntactically. Speakers who\nassert Ravel, a Spaniard, wrote Spanish-style music implicate\nthat Ravel was a Spaniard—they imply but do not say that Ravel\nwas a Spaniard. Hence their utterance is misleading but not a lie if\nthey know Ravel was French. The implicature is conventional in that it\nis determined by the meaning of the sentence via the appositive\nconstruction. Other constructions that generate conventional\nimplicatures are as-parentheticals (as a Spaniard) and\nparenthetical relative clauses (who was Spanish). \nAs\n (1)\n illustrates, when a conversational implicature is false, the\nspeaker’s statement is misleading. Barb’s utterance would\nnonetheless be linguistically flawless. Because [3c] is false, on the\nother hand, the use of\n (3a)\n to make a statement is infelicitous and improper as\nwell as misleading. The truth of [3c] is a precondition of properly\nusing\n (3a)\n to assert what it says. Conventional implicatures like [3c] are\npresuppositions in the non-technical sense in which the\nquestion “Have you cheated again?” presupposes that you\ncheated before. The question is inappropriate, and cannot be given a\nstraight “Yes” or “No” answer, unless you did\ncheat before. For the same reason, the question Is the queen\nEnglish and therefore brave? is improper; answering either\n“Yes” or “No” implies a connection between\nbeing English and\n brave.[9] \nNot all conventional implicatures are presuppositions in the same way.\nFor example, Jack knows that 51 is prime entails and\nimplicates that 51 is prime. It is false and possibly misleading, but\nnot at all linguistically improper. Other words that trigger\nconventional implicatures but not presuppositions are start\nand stop applied to gerunds like cheating (Simons\n2001:\n 432–3).[10] \nGrice (1975: 25) said that conventional implicatures are\ndetermined by the meaning of a sentence. Potts’s (2005:\n35–6; 2007: 669) stronger claim that a sentence cannot be\nused with its conventional meaning without implicating its\nconventional\n implicatures[11]\n is implausible given examples like\n (4).[12] \n\n (3a)\n is used with its conventional meaning in (4a) as the consequent of a\nconditional. But because\n (3c)\n is a conjunct of the antecedent of that conditional, (4a) itself does\nnot imply in any way that being brave follows from being English. A\nspeaker asserting [4a] does not say [3a] and does not mean [3c]. So\nthe speaker does not implicate that being brave follows from being\nEnglish. The antecedent of [4a] prevents the conversational\nimplicature of its consequent from “projecting”. The\nimplicature triggered by the appositive is not implicated for a\ncompletely different reason in (4b). When this sentence is used\nironically, the speaker uses it with its conventional meaning and says\nthat Trump, the stable genius, started a trade war. But because it is\nused to mock Trump’s claim that he is a stable genius, the\nspeaker does not implicate that Trump is a stable genius. Indeed, he\nimplicates the very opposite. The meaning of a sentence determines its\nconventional implicatures, but whether a speaker implicates them\ndepends on how the sentence is used. The speaker does implicate them\nwhen the sentence is used to assert what the sentence\nmeans. The same is not always true for conversational\nimplicatures. \nWhile Grice used “conventional” to denote an implicature\ndetermined by linguistic meaning, W. Davis (1998: Chs. 5–6) and\nLepore & Stone (2015: Pt. II) argue that even conversational\nimplicatures can be conventional in the non-technical sense in which\nit is conventional for women to wear a sari in India but not Mongolia,\nand for German speakers to use rot to mean “red”\nbut not English\n speakers.[13]\n Conventions in this sense are common practices that serve a social\ninterest, perpetuate themselves in certain ways, and are arbitrary in\nthat other practices could have served the same purposes and\nperpetuated themselves. New speakers pick up conventions from prior\nspeakers, often with no instruction. Consider (5): \nIt would be unconventional (unusual, idiosyncratic, even\nunprecedented) for people who say “Some athletes smoke” to\nconversationally implicate that some physically fit people will\ndevelop bladder cancer, but conventional (customary, normal, standard\npractice) for them to implicate that not all athletes smoke. The\ncustomary implicature is not conventional in Grice’s sense,\nthough. For “Not all athletes smoke” is not determined by\nthe meaning of “Some athletes smoke”. Speakers can and\noften do use\n (5a)\n while implicating something other than\n [5b],\n as\n (6)\n will illustrate. The practice of using sentences of the form\n“Some NP VP” to mean “Not all\nNP VP” is not a semantic or syntactic convention. It is\na pragmatic convention. To avoid confusion, I will describe\nimplicatures that are conventional in Grice’s sense as\nsemantic. When not modified by “in Grice’s\nsense”, “conventional” will have the broader sense\nof customary. \nGrice (1975: 37ff) called implicatures like\n [5b]\n generalized conversational implicatures\n(“GCIs”). The term is appropriate because\n (5a)\n can be used to implicate\n [5b]\n in a wide variety of contexts. Grice characterized generalized\nimplicatures as those that “would normally (in the absence of\nspecial circumstances)” be carried by “the use of a\ncertain form of words”. Levinson’s (2000: 11–12,\n16–22, 42–46) characterized GCIs similarly as\n“default inferences”—implicatures we normally and\nautomatically infer in the absence of evidence to the\n contrary.[14]\n These characterizations are too strong in one respect. There is\nnothing abnormal about the use of\n (5a)\n in (6), where Gina would normally implicate [6a] rather than\n [5b]. \nThe fact that “Some athletes smoke” implicates\n [5b]\n in some contexts and\n [6a]\n in others shows that neither is a conventional implicature in\nGrice’s sense. Having more than one GCI is compatible with them\nall being conventional in the broad sense. The word bank has\nseveral meanings in English, including “row”, as in\nbank of switches. So it is conventional to use bank\nto mean “row”, even though this cannot be described as its\nnormal or default use. \nFollowing Grice (1975: 39), it is widely accepted that generalized\nconversational implicatures differ from semantic implicatures in being\ncancelable. Whereas [3a] cannot be asserted without\nimplicating [3c],\n [5a]\n can be asserted without implicating\n [5b].\n The speaker may do this explicitly by adding “Indeed, all\ndo” after uttering “Some athletes smoke”.\nAlternatively, an implicature may be cancelled implicitly by the\nutterance context, as when it is obvious to all that the speaker is\nengaging in understatement. Whereas Some athletes smoke, indeed\nall do could well be true, The queen is English and therefore\nbrave, but being brave does not follow from being English is\ncontradictory. We saw above, though, that even semantic implicatures\ncan be cancelled by figures of speech or conditionals. \nWhereas semantic implicatures are generally entailed by what is said,\nmany believe that conversational implicatures cannot\n be.[15]\n As\n (1),\n (2),\n (5),\n and\n (6)\n illustrate, conversational implicatures are typically not\nentailments. But exceptions have been\n observed.[16]\n When a speaker gives an affirmative answer to “Did you drive\nsomewhere yesterday?” by saying “I drove to Aspen”,\nwhat is implicated (“I did drive somewhere”) is entailed\nby what is said (“I drove to Aspen”). The same is true in\nhyperbole and loose use\n (§4).\n Neale (1992: 529) believes the cancelability of conversational\nimplicatures prevents them from being entailments. But while an\nentailed implicature cannot be explicitly canceled without\ncontradiction (“I drove to Aspen but did not drive\nanywhere”), it can be implicitly canceled. If a blizzard makes\nit obvious that no one could have driven to Aspen yesterday, “I\ndrove to Aspen” may implicate that I did not drive anywhere. \nGrice observed that conversational implicatures are typically\nconnected to what is said rather than the way it is said, so that\n“it is not possible to find another way of saying the same\nthing, which simply lacks the implicature in question” (1975:\n39). The implicature of\n (1)\n is thus said to be nondetachable. Grice allowed exceptions,\nthough, “where some special feature of the substituted version\nis itself relevant to the determination of an implicature” (see\nGrice’s “maxim of Manner” in\n §6).\n Metalinguistic implicatures—those that refer to the particular\nwords the speaker\n used[17]—are\n also clearly detachable. \nIn example (7), Irene used “This is a widgeon” to\nimplicate that the English word for the species is\n“widgeon”. Had Irene used a German sentence with the same\nmeaning (Dies ist eine Pfeife) she would have said the same\nthing while implicating something different (that it is called\n“Pfeife”). Semantic implicatures, in contrast, are\nnondetachable because they are determined by what the sentence\nmeans. \nAs we observed in\n §1,\n Grice defined implicating as a form of speaker meaning. But Grice and\nothers nevertheless began applying “implicate” to\nsentences, analogous to the way “imply”,\n“presuppose”, and “mean” apply to sentences as\nwell as people.\n [18]\n If an implicature is conventional in either sense (that is, either\nsemantic or generalized), we may say that the sentence\nimplicates it, or has the\n implicature.[19]\n Even though Barb implicates that she is not going to Paul’s\nparty, “I have to work” does not itself implicate this.\nBut “Some athletes smoke” implicates that not all do even\nthough speakers can use the sentence without implicating this.\n(Analogy: plane means “airplane” even though\nspeakers can use plane without meaning\n“airplane”.) Similarly,\n (4b)\n implies that Trump is a stable genius even though speakers can use it\nwithout implying that. \nWhereas knowledge of what speakers implicate is essential to fully\nunderstand speakers, knowledge of what sentences implicate is a\ncritical component of our knowledge of a language. This is obvious for\nsentences with semantic implicatures like\n (3a).\n But speakers are not fully competent with “some” unless\nthey know that it is related to “all” in a way it is not\nrelated to “several” or “two”. A man using\n (5a)\n may mislead others if he does not realize that it implicates\n [5b],\n and fail to communicate if he thinks it implicates “It is not\nthe case that several athletes smoke”. \nMany forms of conversational implicature occur frequently in everyday\nspeech and literature, with a wide variety of sentences and in all\nknown languages. They are common ways of both using and understanding\nlanguage. The forms are differentiated in part by the relationship\nbetween what is said and what is implicated. Knowledge of them is an\nimportant component of our linguistic competence, and is acquired at\nan early\n age.[20] \nThe most widely recognized forms of implicature use figures of\nspeech (tropes). Irony, overstatement (hyperbole),\nunderstatement (meiosis and litotes), and metaphor have been known at\nleast since Aristotle. They are taught in school as elements of style.\nWhen Don said in\n (2)\n The weather is lovely, he used irony and implicated that the\nweather is awful. Don did so in part to make light of the awful\nweather. Don could have implicated the same thing by saying The\nweather is not good (litotes) or The weather is the worst in\nhistory (hyperbole). \nFigurative speech is non-literal: users generally do not mean\nwhat they say, and expect their audience to recognize that. (Litotes\nis an exception.) Don did not mean that the weather is lovely. A\ntypical clue that speech is figurative is the obvious falsity of what\nis said. Some figures also tend to be marked intonationally, including\nirony and hyperbole. Others are not, including metaphor and\nunderstatement. They are all used to make speech lively, interesting,\nand stylish\n (§10). \nMany forms of implicature are not figures of speech, and have become\nwidely recognized only since Grice (1975). (1)\n illustrates relevance implicature: the speaker implicates an\nanswer to an expressed or implied question by stating something\nrelated to it by implication or explanation.\n [5b]\n is a quantity (or scalar) implicature: the speaker\nimplicates the denial of a proposition stronger than the one said.\n (6)\n illustrates ignorance implicature: the speaker implicates\nthat something stronger than what was said is unknown.\n (7)\n illustrates metalinguistic implicature: the speaker\nimplicates that something has a certain name by using that name to\ndescribe it. These \"modes of speech\" (non-figurative forms of implicature) are\nnot taught in school, and names for them are not in general use.\nNevertheless, they are as frequent and natural as figurative speech,\nand are learned at the same time. Modes of speech are not marked\nintonationally, and the speech is literal. They are not used to make\nspeech or writing lively. Speakers do not intend what they say to be\nobviously false, and generally do mean what they say. \nTwo modes of speech do have common names. One is damning with\nfaint praise. Grice’s example has become classic: \nA is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a\nphilosophy job, and his letter reads as follows: “Dear Sir, Mr.\nX’s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at\ntutorials has been regular. Yours, etc”. (Grice 1975: 33) \nBy saying so little, A implicated that Mr. X is a poor candidate for\nthe job. The other named mode is loose use, or speaking\nloosely, illustrated by (8): \nIf Mike’s response is typical, what he meant is only that dinner\nwill be served close enough to six o’clock for current\npurposes. That would be typically be true if dinner will be\nserved at 6:01. What Mike said, though, is that dinner will be served\nat 6:00, which would be false if dinner is served at\n 6:01.[21]\n If Mike gave the same response to a question about when a swimmer\ntouched the wall in the final lap of an Olympic event, 6:01 may not be\nclose enough. \nThe figures and modes of speech are common, socially useful practices.\nThey perpetuate themselves through precedent following, social\nacceptance, individual habit and association, and traditional\ntransmission from one generation of speakers to another. Precedent\noperates when hearers call on their knowledge of the forms speakers\ncommonly use to either interpret speakers in new contexts, or to\npredict what hearers will understand. The forms are less arbitrary\nthan lexical or syntactic conventions, but no one has to implicate\nrather than say things, or use one form of implicature rather than\nothers. \nSince these conventions do not attach implicatures to particular\nsentence forms, they do not give rise to sentence implicatures. \nAs our examples make clear, semantics, conceived as the study\nof the meaning of words and sentences, does not exhaust the study of\nmeaning. The study of speaker meaning and implicature is included in\npragmatics, which covers the broad range of speech acts\nperformed by using words and sentences. Applied pragmatics\narose from the recognition that second language learners cannot become\nfully proficient without mastering more than grammar and literal\nmeaning (Kasper 2003). Clinical pragmatics studies\ncommunication disorders that arise from failure to master pragmatic\nrules (Cummings 2009, 2014). Formal pragmatics uses formal\nmodels of utterances, contexts, and discourse to state precise rules\nspecifying the interpretation of an utterance in a context, including\nwhat is both said and implicated (Roberts 2006). \nThe phenomenon of Gricean conventional implicature\n (§2)\n shows further that standard truth conditional semantics does not\nexhaust semantics. For example, Ravel, a Spaniard, wrote\nSpanish-style music and Ravel was a Spaniard and wrote\nSpanish-style music have the same entailments. Yet they differ in\nmeaning in such a way that the former but not the latter is\ninfelicitous and improper because Ravel was French.\n“False” clearly applies to the latter but not to the\nformer. \nImplicature is important even in truth conditional semantics. For\nexample, logicians customarily take sentences of the form\n“p or q” to be true provided\n“p” or “q” or both\nare true. Thus “It is not the case that cats meow or purr”\nwould be counted as false. But there are also cases in which speakers\nuse “p or q” to mean that\n“p” or “q” is true but\nnot both. This would be the natural way to interpret someone who\nsaid “John is going to invite Mary or Jane to the prom”.\nSome maintain that “or” is ambiguous in English,\nwith an inclusive and an exclusive sense. But another possibility is\nthat the exclusive interpretation is a generalized conversational\nimplicature. One piece of evidence supporting the implicature\nhypothesis is that the exclusive interpretation seems cancelable. Thus\n“Jane will visit France or Germany this summer; indeed, she will\ndrive through both on her way to Poland” has no contradictory\ninterpretation. A methodological issue is to describe the evidence\nnecessary to decide whether a particular interpretation is a sense or\na generalized conversational implicature. A foundational issue to is\ndescribe exactly what the difference consists in. \nImplicature continues to be invoked in this way to defend\ncontroversial semantic claims: \nBut there is another interpretation, marked by\n intonation[23]\n and other features, on which the negation in (9) denies the\n“not all” implicature of “The boy ate some of the\ncookies”, and is thus consistent. The question is how to account for the two different\ninterpretations of negations given that the word “not”\nseems unambiguous (Geurts 1998). Horn (1989: 362–4;\n370–5) and Burton-Roberts (1989) propose that the marked\ninterpretation of (9) is an implicature. W. Davis (2016a: Ch. 6)\nargues that it is an idiom that plausibly evolved from a generalized\nconversational implicature. \nImplicature plays a well-attested diachronic role in\ngrammaticalization and the origin of new meanings and\n idioms.[24]\n For example, metaphors have a typical life cycle: beginning as\nsomething a speaker means on a particular occasion; being picked up by\nothers; catching on, which means becoming self-perpetuating and\nspreading through the population; and finally, dying and becoming a\nnew lexical meaning or idiom. When dead, what used to be indirectly\nexpressed is directly expressed. The term virus as applied to\ncomputers went through this evolution in the last few decades,\noriginally denoting a biological organism that spreads from host to\nhost, now having another meaning on which it denotes computer programs\nthat spread from computer to computer in a similar fashion. When a\ndead metaphor has syntactic structure like go viral, it is an\nidiom. When metaphors become widespread and\nself-perpetuating, but are not yet idioms, they generate generalized\nconversational\n implicatures.[25] \nIn addition to identifying the phenomenon of implicature, and\nclassifying its types, Grice developed a theory designed to explain\nand predict conversational implicatures and to describe how they are\nunderstood. Grice (1975: 26–30) postulated a general\nCooperative Principle and four maxims specifying how\nto be cooperative. It is common knowledge, he asserted, that people\ngenerally follow these rules for efficient communication. \nCooperative Principle. Contribute what is required by\nthe accepted purpose of the conversation. \nGrice viewed these not as arbitrary conventions, but as instances of\ngeneral rules governing rational, cooperative behavior. For example,\nif Jane is helping Kelly build a house, she will hand Kelly a hammer\nrather than a tennis racket (relevance), more than one nail when\nseveral are needed (quantity), and straight nails rather than bent\nones (quality); she will do all this quickly and efficiently\n(manner). \nRelevance implicatures like\n (1)\n are thought to arise from the maxim of Relation. Barb would have\ninfringed this maxim unless her contribution were relevant to the\npurpose of the conversation. If Barb was being cooperative, then she\nwas trying to answer Alan’s question. Given that working is\nincompatible with partying, it is inferred that Barb must have\nintended to communicate that she is not going to the party. Grice\n(1975: 34) thought other implicatures arise by flouting\nmaxims. This happens when what a cooperative speaker says so patently\nviolates a maxim that the hearer must infer that the speaker means\nsomething different. Irony is thought to arise from flouting the maxim\nof Quality\n (§9). \nGeneralizing from such examples, Grice provided a theoretical account\nof conversational implicature that has been widely\n adopted.[26]\n A representative formulation goes as follows, with S the\nspeaker and H the hearer. \nTheoretical Definition: S conversationally\nimplicates p iff S implicates p when: \nThis says that an implicature is conversational provided conditions\n(i)–(iii) are satisfied, where (ii) is the condition that\nS’s believing p is required for\nS to be in conformity with the Cooperative Principle. The\nTheoretical Definition does not entail that S implicated p is\ninferable from (i)–(iii). Calculability does that. \nCalculability: Conversational implicatures must be\ncapable of being worked\n out.[27] \nGrice’s calculability principle says more than that hearers are\ngenerally able to infer what speakers implicate on the basis of the\nlinguistic meaning of what they utter. The same is true of what people\n say.[28]\n To work out an implicature is to infer it in a specific way\nfrom the Cooperative Principle using particular facts about the\nmeaning of the sentence uttered and the context of utterance. \nTo work out that a particular conversational implicature is present,\nthe hearer will rely on the following data: (1) the conventional\nmeaning of the words used, together with the identity of any\nreferences that may be involved; (2) the Cooperative Principle and its\nmaxims; (3) the context, linguistic or otherwise, of the utterance;\n(4) other items of background knowledge; and (5) the fact (or supposed\nfact) that all relevant items falling under the previous headings are\navailable to both participants and both participants know or assume\nthis to be the case. A general pattern for the working-out of a\nconversational implicature might be given as follows: He has said\nthat q; there is no reason to suppose that he is not observing the\nmaxims, or at least the Cooperative Principle [Cooperative\nPresumption]; he could not be doing this unless he thought that\np [Determinacy]; he knows (and knows that I know that he knows)\nthat I can see that the supposition that he thinks that p is\nrequired [Mutual Knowledge]; he has done nothing to stop me thinking\nthat p; he intends me to think, or is at least willing to allow\nme to think, that p; and so he has implicated that\np”. (Grice 1975: 31; my emphasis and insertions) \nKey steps of the working out schema have been named in brackets,\ncorresponding to (i)–(iii) in the Theoretical\n Definition.[29] \nIn addition to postulating that the conversationality of an\nimplicature depends on the Cooperative Presumption, Determinacy, and\nMutual Knowledge conditions, and that the implicature can be inferred\nin part from their satisfaction, Grice claimed that the conditions\ngive rise to or generate the implicatures.\nThe implicatures exist because conditions\n(i)–(iii) are\n satisfied.[30]\n From his assumption that conversational implicatures can be explained\nand predicted on the basis of the Cooperative Principle, Grice drew a\nmethodological conclusion: \nGrice’s Razor: Other things equal, it is\npreferable to postulate conversational implicatures rather than\nsenses, semantic implicatures, or semantic presuppositions because\nconversational implicatures can be derived from independently\nmotivated psycho-social\n principles.[31] \nThe pithy formulation is “Senses are not to be multiplied beyond\nnecessity”, alluding to Ockham. If a phenomenon can be explained\nand predicted in terms of psycho-social principles, then it is\ntheoretically more economical to do so than to posit senses and the\nlike, which cannot be so explained. Grice’s Razor is often\ninvoked to support classifying the exclusive interpretation of\n“p or q” as an implicature rather than\nas a second sense\n (§5). \nFollowing Grice, “conversational implicature” was defined\nin\n §2\n to mean an implicature that depends on features of the\nconversational context and is not determined by the conventional\nmeaning of the sentence uttered. On this definition,\nGrice’s Theoretical Definition and Calculability are empirical\nhypotheses that may turn out to be false. Indeed, we will review\nevidence against these hypotheses below. Many linguists and\nphilosophers, however, take Calculability to be true by definition.\nThey take “conversational implicature” to mean an\nimplicature that can be worked out from what is said and the\nCooperative Principle or its\n maxims.[32]\n If this definition is adopted, then what the evidence would show is\nthat the implicatures illustrated in\n §§1–4\n are not conversational, even those that are not conventional in\nGrice’s sense (cf. Lepore & Stone 2015: 6, 83, 148). \nWhile Grice viewed his ideas as tentative and exploratory, followers\nhave taken the theory to be well established. Indeed, it has served as\na paradigm for research in pragmatics. Serious difficulties have\nemerged. \nAccording to Grice’s Theoretical Definition\n (§6),\n conversational implicatures depend on a presumption that the speaker\nis observing the Cooperative Principle. W. Davis (1998: §2.5)\nnotes, however, that speakers can engage in implicature when there is\nno conversation. All the figures and modes of speech can appear in\nprivate journals or in manuscripts that have little hope of being\nread.\n [33] \nThe Cooperative Principle further assumes that the participants in\nevery conversation strive only to achieve common goals. From the\nperspective of social psychology, evolutionary biology, and game\ntheory, Pinker (2007) observes that pure cooperation is generally an\nunrealistic idealization or naive assumption. Conversations are often\namong adversaries, whose goals beyond communication are opposed. It\nwould be foolhardy and possibly dangerous for an interrogator to\npresume that a prisoner of war or terrorism suspect is being\ncooperative. Even when participants are friends or relatives, they\noften have some divergent goals, and may give priority to other\nprinciples\n (§10).\n To the extent that they diverge, the speaker’s goals may be\npromoted and the hearer’s goals thwarted by withholding\ninformation, providing misinformation, going off on a tangent, or\nbeing obscure. Even when it is correctly presumed that a speaker is\nnot being cooperative, the speaker may use all the figures and modes\nof speech. If the prosecuting attorney asks the defendant whether he\nwas in the bank on the day of the robbery, the defendant might answer\n“I took my mother to the hospital that day”, thereby\nimplicating that he was not at the bank. He may do this in the hope of\nmisleading the jury as well as the prosecutor. The official purpose of\nthe conversation is to get at the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\nbut the truth. But the defendant’s purpose is to hide it. \nMany conversations have goals other than the exchange of information.\nOne is amusement, which speakers often pursue by making jokes (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: §11.3). Because the goal is not to provide\ninformation, the maxims of Quality, Quantity, and Relation do not\napply. If for any of these reasons the Cooperative Principle does not\napply, reasoning based on it will be unsound. \nMany have observed that for every implicature that appears to be\ncorrectly predicted by Gricean theory, others appear to be falsely\n predicted.[34]\n The schema used to “work out” observed implicatures can\nusually be used just as well to work out nonexistent implicatures. So\nthe schema as formulated is invalid—an unreliable\nmethod of inferring implicatures. By a simple application of\nMill’s Methods, it follows that the observed implicatures do not\nexist because of the Gricean factors. \nWe will illustrate using the case that has been most extensively\nstudied, and is generally considered a paradigm application of Gricean\ntheory: the derivation of quantity implicatures from the maxim of\nQuantity. Adapted to\n (5),\n here is Huang’s (2014: 34) formulation. \nSince the speaker has used a semantically weaker expression (i.e.,\nsome) where a semantically stronger one (e.g., all)\nis available, he would contradict Grice’s Quantity Maxim if the\nsemantically stronger sentence held. Consequently, he believes that\nthe semantically stronger statement does not hold. Furthermore, he has\nnot done anything to stop the addressee thinking that he so thinks,\ntherefore he conversationally implicates that not all athletes\n smoke.[35] \nIn the typical case represented by\n (5),\n S says “Some athletes smoke” and implicates\n“Not all athletes smoke”. The stronger statement\nS does not make is “All athletes smoke”. There\nare countless statements more informative than what S said, however,\nwhose negations were not implicated, including Several athletes\nsmoke, Some athletes smoke regularly, I know some athletes smoke,\nand 13% of all athletes smoke. The Gricean reasoning could be\nrepeated using any of these stronger statements, with fallacious\nresults. For example: \nS said “Some athletes smoke”. If S were\nin a position to assert the stronger statement “Several athletes\nsmoke” but did not, S would be in a breach of the maxim\nof Quantity unless S wished to convey that it does not hold.\nSo S implicated that it is not the case that several athletes\nsmoke. \nBut speakers who utter sentences of the form “Some S\nare P” rarely if ever implicate the denial of\n“Several S are\n P”.[36]\n Among the infinity of statements stronger than “Some athletes\nsmoke”, “All athletes smoke” is highly unusual in\nthat people commonly implicate its denial. Since the derivations have\nthe same form whether or not their conclusions are observed to be\ntrue, Lepore & Stone (2015: 143ff) call this the\n“symmetry” problem. The Gricean derivation seems plausible\nonly because we knew antecedently that the conclusion is\n true.[37] \nAn irony underscoring the ex post facto character of the\nGricean calculation is that Grice himself derived an\nignorance implicature from the maxim of Quantity. \nA is planning with B an itinerary for a holiday in France. Both know\nthat A wants to see his friend C, if to do so would not involve too\ngreat a prolongation of his journey: \nA: Where does C live?\n\nB: Somewhere in the South of France. \n(Gloss: There is no reason to suppose that B is opting out; his answer\nis, as he well knows, less informative than is required to meet\nA’s needs. This infringement of the first maxim of Quantity can\nbe explained only by the supposition that B is aware that to be more\ninformative would be to say something that infringed the second maxim\nof Quality. “Don’t say what you lack adequate evidence\nfor”, so B implicates that he does not know in which town C\nlives.) (Grice 1975: 32–33; example number\n deleted)[38] \nIt is plausible that B would have implicated this. But if\nGrice’s reasoning is valid, why shouldn’t Huang assume\nthat someone uttering “Some athletes smoke” must be\nignorant of whether all athletes smoke? If Huang’s reasoning is\nvalid, why shouldn’t Grice assume that B knows a stronger\nstatement does not hold, such as that A lives in the southernmost city\nin France? \nAccounting for the differences in implicature described in this\nsection is an outstanding problem for pragmatic theory. \nGrice’s Determinacy condition states that S\nconversationally implicates p only if S has to\nbelieve (and implicate) p if S’s utterance is\nto be consistent with the Cooperative Principle. Determinacy is a key\npremise in the working-out schema, so Calculability depends on it. As\n §8\n illustrated, however, there are normally many alternative ways to be\ncooperative, and contribute what is required by the conversation, even\nwhen the meanings and referents of the words used are taken as\ngiven. \nGrice believed irony involves flouting Quality. Here is Grice’s\noft-repeated “gloss” applied to\n (2),\n in which Don said “The weather’s lovely” during a\nblizzard. \nIt is perfectly obvious to Don and his audience (Carla) that what Don\nhas said is something he does not believe, and the audience knows that\nDon knows that is obvious to the audience. So … Don must be\ntrying to get across some other proposition than the one he purports\nto be putting forward. This must be some obviously related\nproposition; the most obviously related proposition is the\ncontradictory of the one he purports to be putting forward. (After\nGrice 1975:\n 34).[39] \nWhile irony often involves saying something obviously false, it need\nnot have been obvious to Carla in\n (2)\n that Don believed the weather was unlovely. She may have had no\nindependent source of information about his weather. Don would also\nhave made a suitable contribution to the conversation if he had meant\nand believed that the weather is lovely. So Determinacy is unsatisfied\nin irony when the speaker could have been speaking literally,\nbelieving what was said (W. Davis 1998: §3.3; see even Grice\n1978: 53). \nMany have observed that the obvious falsity of what speakers say\nmay signal that they mean something else, but it does not tell us what\nelse they mean (e.g., Levinson 1983: 157–8; Lepore & Stone\n2015: 38–9). Indeed, metaphor is another case in which Grice\n(1975: 34) takes the speaker to be flouting\n Quality.[40]\n So the flouting of Quality does not tell us which figure of speech\nDon is using. He would have made a suitable contribution to the\nconversation if he had been engaging in metaphor instead of irony,\nmeaning and believing that relations between he and his partner (the\n“weather” in the cabin) are fine. \nMetaphors are often difficult to interpret. Suppose a commentator says\n“Iraq was Bush’s Vietnam”, referring to George W.\nBush and the second Gulf War. Did she mean that the U.S. lost in Iraq\nthe way it lost in Vietnam? That the reasons for going to war in Iraq\nwere as misguided as those that got the U.S. into Vietnam? Or did she\nperhaps mean that even though the U.S. did not secure all its\nobjectives, the Iraq war was still worth fighting? She could mean and\nbelieve any of these things and still be making a useful contribution.\nLepore & Stone (2015: Ch. 10) describe such metaphors as inviting\nhearers to imagine all the things the speaker might have meant. Grice\n(1975: 39–40) himself acknowledged such cases when he said that\n \nthere may be many possible specific explanations … ; and if the\nlist of these is open, the implicatum will have just the kind of\nindeterminacy that many implicata do in fact\n have.[41] \nBut to say this is to deny Determinacy and\n Calculability.[42] \nRysiew (2000: 577–8) suggested weakening the determinacy\ncondition by replacing “has to believe (and implicate)\np” with “is likely to believe (and\nimplicate) p”. As he notes, hearers commonly use\nabduction to figure out what speakers have implicated (cf. Hobbs et\nal. 1993). Abduction is a specific form of inductive or\nnon-demonstrative reasoning in which a hypothesis is inferred to be\ntrue from the fact that it provides the best explanation of the data.\nBy their nature, non-demonstrative methods are not guaranteed to\nsucceed. This fact of life is no reason to shun induction when seeking\nto discover implicatures. W. Davis (1998: 66–8) had observed, though, that an\nimplicature can exist and be conversational even though the available\nevidence does not make that implicature (or belief) more likely than\nothers. Examples like those above with more than two equally likely alternatives show this. \nSaul (2001, 2002, 2010) and M. S. Green (2002) suggested that\n“implicature” be defined normatively, as\nproperly implicating something. W. Davis\n(2007a) replied that while determinacy is more plausible\nas a norm, similar considerations show that it is not required\neven for properly meaning one thing by saying something else. For example, a speaker who says “I ate some of the\ncookies” could properly be meaning either “I ate them\nall” (engaging in understatement), or “I did not eat them\nall” (quantity implicature), or “I do not know whether I\nate them all” (ignorance implicature). None of these\ncontributions is required given that all would be appropriate. \nGrice (1975: 30) recognized that his maxims may “clash”.\nWhen they do, there is no way to determine what is required for\nconformity to the Cooperative Principle. In the case of irony, for\nexample, Manner clashes with Quality. When Don said “The\nweather’s lovely”, we cannot interpret him as meaning what\nhe said because on that interpretation he would be violating Quality.\nBut we cannot interpret him as meaning the opposite because then he\nwould be violating Manner (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 18–9). It\nis more perspicuous to explicitly state something than to implicate\nit. \nWe use irony and other figures in part because we have conversational\ngoals other than the efficient communication of information (Lakoff\n1977; Sainsbury 1984: 427–9). We observe not only the\nCooperative Principle, but also the Principle of Style. \nPrinciple of Style: Be stylish, so be beautiful,\ndistinctive, entertaining, and interesting. \nClear and simple prose—”just the facts,\nplease”—can be boring, tedious and dull. We liven up our\nwriting with figures of speech. Metaphor in\nparticular makes speech more interesting and insightful by engaging\nour imagination (Lepore & Stone 2015: Ch. 10). In the process, we\nsacrifice perspicuity (violating Manner). We sometimes\n“embellish” a narration to make it more interesting\n(violating Quality) and delete boring or ugly details even when they\nare important (violating Quantity). \nThe Gricean maxims often clash with the Principle of Politeness,\nemphasized by Leech\n (1983).[43] \nPrinciple of Politeness: Be polite, so be tactful,\nrespectful, generous, praising, modest, deferential, and\nsympathetic. \nSpeakers frequently withhold information that would be offensive or\ndisappointing to the hearer, violating Quantity. Speakers often\nexaggerate in order to please or flatter, and utter “white\nlies” in order to spare the hearer’s feelings, violating\nQuality. People pick “safe topics” (e.g., the weather) to\nstress agreement and communicate an interest in maintaining good\nrelations, violating Relation. Euphemisms avoid mentioning the\nunmentionable, but in the process violate Manner. \nOne common motive for implicating something is that it is often\nperceived to be more polite than asserting it (Pinker 2007; Huang\n2014: 142). In case\n (1),\n Barb may have answered Alan’s question indirectly because she\nthinks it is less likely to hurt his feelings, even if she realizes he\nwill assume that is what she is doing. \nProminent linguists have sought to improve on Grice’s\nformulation of the conversational principles, and provide a solution\nto the problem of clashes. Horn (2004: §4) replaces Quantity,\nRelevance, and Manner with two interrelated\n principles.[44] \nQ Principle: Say as much as you can [given Quality\nand R]. \nR Principle: Say no more than you must [given Q]. \nLevinson (2000: 76, 114, 137) adopts similar principles, which he\ncalls “Q” and “I” (for\n “Informativeness”).[45]\n Since Horn believes that interpretations like [10a] are derivable\nfrom the R-principle, he calls them “R-based\nimplicatures”. The assumption is that there is no reason to make\na stronger statement (say more) if the extra information can be\ncontributed by implicature. Implicature [11b] is similarly described\nas “Q-based”. The assumption is that if the speaker did\nnot make a stronger statement (say more), its denial was\nimplicated. \nHorn has clearly identified two distinct and very general patterns of\nmeaning and interpretation. Critics maintain, however, that\nHorn’s two principles provide no reason to expect the two\nindicated interpretations rather than those we do not observe (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: §3.1; W. Davis 2016a: §4.7). They ask how\nQ can predict [11b] without predicting [10b], and how [10a] can be\nderivable from R if [11a] is not. What in R predicts [10a] rather than\nother strengthenings, such as “He broke someone else’s\nfinger”?\n [46] \nHorn goes on to formulate what he calls the Division of\nPragmatic Labor: \nGiven two expressions covering the same semantic ground, a relatively\nunmarked form—briefer and/or more lexicalized—tends to be\nR-associated with a particular unmarked, stereotypical meaning, use,\nor situation, while the use of the periphrastic or less lexicalized\nexpression, typically more complex or prolix, tends to be Q-restricted\nto those situations outside the stereotype, for which the unmarked\nexpression could not have been used appropriately. (Horn 2004: 16) \nHorn illustrates this division with the contrast between (12) and\n(13). \nHorn appears to be assuming, plausibly, that “stopped” and\n“got to stop” have the same meaning. If so, then it is\ndifficult to see how either implicature could be derived from Q or R,\nwhich refer to what is said, not how it is said.\n(Recall Grice’s nondetachability criterion.) Levinson (2000:\n136–7) therefore reinstated a version of\n Manner.[47] \nM Principle: Indicate abnormal, nonstereotypical\nsituations by using marked expressions that contrast with those you\nwould use to describe the corresponding normal, stereotypical\nsituations. \nLevinson describes “got to stop” as “marked”\nbecause it is more complex and less lexicalized than\n“stopped”. W. Davis (2016a: 160) notes, though, that when\nwe look at clear cases in which a single word is synonymous with a\nless lexicalized phrase, we often find no difference in implicature\n(e.g., mare versus adult female horse). And the word\noften connotes an unusually good example of the kind (e.g.,\nstallion in common parlance connotes an especially fast or\ndominant uncastrated adult male horse). \nHorn sometimes describes Q and R as “antinomic forces”\n(e.g., Horn 2004: 14), which would be appropriate if the bracketed\nconditions were omitted. Without the conditions, Horn’s\nprinciples would clash as often as\n Grice’s.[48]\n Without independent means of determining antecedently which force\nwill “prevail” in a given case, Horn’s principles\nwould lack predictive or explanatory value. Lepore & Stone (2015:\n§3.1) suggest treating Horn’s principles as\n“simultaneous equations”, constraining but not determining\nthe conversational implicatures. But this assumes the equations have a\nsolution. Not all simultaneous equations do. \nLevinson (2000: 157–64) sought to avoid clashes by stating an\norder of precedence: Q > M > R. Huang (2014: 49) reverses the\nordering, saying that  \nthe R-principle generally takes precedence until the use of a\ncontrastive linguistic form induces a Q-implicature to the\nnon-applicability of the pertinent R-implicature….  \nSuch orderings make sense only if the bracketed clauses in Q and R are omitted.\nW. Davis (2016a: 159) responds that Levinson’s ordering makes it\nis hard to see why\n (10)\n or\n (12)\n should have an R implicature rather than a Q implicature, while\nHuang’s ordering makes it hard to explain why\n (11)\n and\n (13)\n have Q\n implicatures.[49] \nThe most influential alternative to Gricean and neo-Gricean theory,\ncalled “Relevance theory”, was developed by Sperber and\n Wilson.[50] \nWe have proposed a definition of relevance and suggested what factors\nmight be involved in assessments of degrees of relevance. We have also\nargued that all Grice’s maxims can be replaced by a single\nprinciple of relevance—that the speaker tries to be as relevant\nas possible in the circumstances—which, when suitably\nelaborated, can handle the full range of data that Grice’s\nmaxims were designed to explain. (Wilson & Sperber 1986: 381) \n“Relevance” is given a highly technical sense, in which\nthe relevance of a proposition in a context is directly related to how\nmany positive cognitive effects it has and inversely related to how\nmuch effort is required to process it (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 6,\n62–3,\n 219).[51]\n “Positive cognitive effects” are “improvements in\nknowledge”, including “true contextual implications, or\nwarranted strengthenings or weakenings of existing assumptions”.\nContextual implications are propositions logically implied by the\nproposition and the cognitive context together but from neither alone.\nPropositions or assumptions are objects of belief or\nknowledge—cognitive representations. Wilson and Sperber\nillustrate their concept by imagining a doctor whose choice of true\nstatements is confined to the alternatives in (14). \nThey conclude that [14b] would be maximally relevant on the grounds\nthat it entails everything [14a] does and more, while being as easy to\nprocess; [14c] has the same cognitive effects as\n [14b],[52]\n but is harder to process. \nExample (14) is a special case in that either the effects or the\neffort are equal between alternative contributions. To know what is\nmaximally relevant in other cases, a particular function of effects\nand effort must be specified (Hinkelman 1987). Sperber and Wilson\nspecify one when describing the theory of cognition on which they\nground their theory of communication. “Our claim is that all\nhuman beings automatically aim at the most efficient information\nprocessing possible” (Sperber & Wilson 1986a: 49).\n“Efficiency in cognition … involves processing inputs\nthat offer the best possible cost/benefit ratio at the\ntime”(Wilson & Sperber 2012:\n 62).[53]\n Selecting this function and formulating a principle in the style of\nGrice’s yields: \nPrinciple of Maximal Relevance (Cognitive\nEfficiency): Contribute that which has the maximum ratio of\npositive cognitive effects to processing\n cost.[54] \nWe will see that Relevance theorists qualify this idea, but many\nimportant points can be made with the simpler principle. \nWhile Grice’s maxims enjoin the speaker to contribute the\nrequired information and do so perspicuously and briefly, they do not\nrequire the speaker to maximize information, perspicuity, or brevity\nwhen other things are equal. For example, Grice’s maxims do not\npredict that Barb implicated I am not going anywhere in\n (1)\n even though it is more informative than I am not going to\nPeter’s party, and may have a greater effects/cost ratio.\nOr suppose that in a discussion of a new prescription drug benefit,\nsomeone comments “It will take some money to fund that\nprogram”. The speaker would normally be engaging in\nunderstatement, implicating “The program will be very\nexpensive”. Relevance theorists account for this by saying that\nbecause the proposition explicitly conveyed is trivial, and thus has\nfew positive cognitive effects, the hearer will “recover”\nthe more informative\n proposition.[55]\n Critics respond that countless propositions are more informative than\nthe one implicated, such as “The program will cost\ntrillions”, and seem as easy to process.\n [56] \nConversely, Maximal Relevance does not imply or subsume Grice’s\nprinciples. For instance, nothing guarantees that the contribution\nwith the most positive cognitive effects per unit processing cost is\ngermane to the topic of the conversation or as informative as required\n(less informative contributions might have more positive cognitive\neffects per unit processing cost). As a result, Maximal Relevance does\nnot predict what Barb implicated in example\n (1).\n The proposition I am not going to Peter’s party will\nhave different effects than I am not going to Paul’s\nparty, but seems as easy to process and could well have as many\npositive cognitive\n effects.[57]\n Only the proposition about Paul is relevant in the ordinary sense to\nwhat Alan asked, but this does not entail that it is maximally\nrelevant in the technical sense of Relevance\n theory.[58] \nSperber and Wilson observe that Gricean theory provides no explanation\nfor why Don would say in\n (2)\n that the weather is lovely if he wanted to express the opposite\nbelief.[59]\n Maximal Relevance has the same problem: Don’s simply saying\nwhat he means would seem easier to process and thus more efficient.\nWilson & Sperber (2004: 621) think saying something in order to\nmean the opposite would be “patently irrational”. Adler\n(1987: 710) observed, however, that it need not be irrational given\nhow readily hearers recognize when speakers do so. Moreover, speakers\nengaging in irony are doing more than meaning the opposite of what\nthey said. As Grice (1978: 53–4) later recognized, they are also\npretending to mean and assert what they\n said,[60]\n and are expressing more than disbelief of what is said. Sperber and\nWilson call it a “dissociative attitude—wry, skeptical,\nbitter, or\n mocking”.[61]\n Hearers readily recognize and commonly enjoy the performance of this\ncomplex speech act. The observation that irony involves expressing a\ndissociative attitude does not lessen the theoretical problem,\nhowever. There is no reason to think, for example, that “The\nweather is terrible and anyone who thinks it lovely is foolish”\nhas the maximum effects/cost ratio. Processing just what Don actually\nsaid (that the weather is lovely) would seem to require even less\neffort; so that proposition could conceivably have a greater\neffect/cost ratio. And there is no reason to think an ironic\ninterpretation has a greater effect/cost ratio than a hyperbolic or\nmeiotic interpretation. If expressing a dissociative attitude involves\nsomething other than expressing a proposition, as seems plausible (cf.\nM. S. Green 2018: §5), it would not be a positive cognitive\neffect as defined, and thus would not affect the relevance ratio. For\nreasons such as these, Levinson (1989: 463–4) charged that the\naccounts offered by Relevance theorists are as ex post facto\nas Gricean accounts. \nThe explanations of loose use offered by Relevance theorists are\nproblematic in another way. In\n (8),\n where Mike said “Dinner will be at six”, they explain why\nMike did not say something true like “Dinner will be at six or\nshortly after” by saying that the strictly false statement has\nthe same positive cognitive effects but is easier to process and so\nmore\n relevant.[62]\n But that would erroneously imply that Mike did not mean and\nimplicate that dinner will be at six or shortly after.\nAnother reason the explanation is unsatisfactory is that there are\nother things Mike did not say with the same positive contextual\neffects that seem as easy to process as “Dinner will be\nat six”. including “Dinner will be\naround six”. This proposition has some true cognitive\neffects that “Dinner will be at six” lacks, including\n“Dinner may not be exactly at six”. \nThe recital example in\n §10\n illustrates on reason why Relevance theories adopt Optimal rather than Maximal\nRelevance (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 64–5):\n \nthe communicator is manifestly limited by her own abilities (to\nprovide appropriate information, and to present it in the most\nefficient way). Nor can she be expected to go against her own\npreferences (e.g., against the goal she wants to achieve in\ncommunicating, or the rules of etiquette she wishes to follow).  \nHowever:  \nSince it is also manifest that the audience will tend to pay\nappropriate attention only to an utterance that seems relevant enough,\nit is manifest that the communicator wants her audience to assume that\nthe utterance is indeed relevant enough. There is thus a minimal level\nof relevance that the audience is encouraged to expect: the utterance\nshould be relevant enough to be worth the effort needed for\ncomprehension. \nPresumption of Optimal Relevance: \nBecause of its preference provision, Optimal Relevance does not clash\nwith Politeness and Style the way Maximal Relevance does. The parents\nmay say “Your performance wasn’t perfect” rather\nthan “It was horrendous” because they strongly prefer not\nto hurt their daughter’s\n feelings.[64]\n This means, however, that Optimal Relevance would not predict that\nBarb meant I am not going to Paul’s party in\n (1)\n even if it is relevant enough to process and more relevant than the\nother alternatives. For Barb might have preferred to dodge\nAlan’s question. In\n (2),\n Don may have preferred an ironic utterance to ones with higher E/C\nratios (Millikan 1987: 725). \nThe ratio of positive cognitive effects to processing cost is zero\nwhen there are no positive cognitive effects at all. Given the\ndefinition of contextual implication, any proposition that is part of\nthe cognitive context has no contextual implications. So both Maximal\nand Optimal Relevance seem to imply that speakers cannot mean or\nimplicate anything already known, and must mean something else. Gerrig\n(1987: 718) and McCawley (1987: 724) find this implausible. If A and B\nare walking in torrential rain, A might well say “It is raining\nreally hard”, stating the obvious, and B might respond\n“There is indeed some rain coming down”, engaging in\nunderstatement and implicating exactly what A said. \nMany critics have observed, and Sperber and Wilson have acknowledged,\nthat relevance as defined is not\n measurable.[65]\n Positive cognitive effects are non-denumerable. Anything a speaker\nmight say or implicate will have infinitely many true contextual\nimplications if it has\n any.[66]\n We do not know whether processing cost is measured by time, mental\neffort, electro-chemical energy, inferential steps, or some function\nof them all. We have no unit of measurement for mental effort, and do\nnot yet know how to measure the energy consumed in processing an\nutterance. If relevance is not well defined and knowable, it cannot be\nused to account for specific implicatures. \nWe have looked at Relevance theory as an alternative attempt to\npredict and explain what speakers implicate. The main focus of\nRelevance theorists, however, is the process by which hearers\ninterpret utterances. The hearer’s aim, on their view,\nis “to find an interpretation of the speaker’s meaning\nthat satisfies the presumption of optimal relevance”. They infer\nthat the hearer “should follow a path of least effort, and stop\nat the first overall interpretation that satisfies his expectations of\nrelevance” (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 7). Discussion of this\npart of Relevance theory is beyond the scope of this entry. \nAs observed in\n §1,\n Grice (1975: 24) introduced the technical term\n“implicature” to denote either (i) the act of meaning or\nimplying one thing by saying something else, or (ii) what the speaker\nmeant or implied. Grice (1975: 87ff) used “say” quite\nstrictly, requiring what a speaker says to be closely related to what\nthe sentence uttered means on that occasion. Indexicals provide cases\nin which what a speaker says is not what the sentence used means. When\nBarb uttered “I have to work” in\n (1),\n she said that she, Barb, has to work; but the sentence she used does\nnot mean “She, Barb, has to work” even on that occasion.\nEllipsis allows people to say things without even uttering sentences.\nIf John asks “Where did Mary go?” and Sue answers\n“To the gym”, then Sue said that Mary went to the gym. The\ninfinitive phrase she uttered was elliptical for a sentence meaning\n“Mary went to the gym” but does not itself mean that. \nSperber and Wilson (1986a: 182–3) introduced the parallel term\nexplicature to mean what is “explicitly\ncommunicated”. Carston (1988: 33) initially identified this with\n“what is said, in Grice’s\n terms”.[67]\n On this definition, Barb’s explicature in\n (1)\n was that she has to work, and her implicature was that she is not\ngoing to Paul’s party”. Carston’s (1988: 40)\nparadigm case is less clear. \nAfter saying or observing that Alice ran to the edge of the cliff, a\nspeaker would typically use (15a) “Alice jumped” to mean\nthat Alice jumped off the cliff [15b]. Carston counts this an\nexplicature. It does resemble ellipsis, but a speaker who used (15a)\nto mean that Alice jumped up to the rescue helicopter said the\nsame thing while meaning something different. And if the speaker\nknew that Alice jumped up to safety, the speaker might be accused of\nmisleading the hearer but not of lying. \nCarston’s (1988: 45; 2004a: 646–8) most influential\nargument is based on what are commonly called “embedded\nimplicatures”. She would claim that if “Alice jumped off\nthe cliff” were an implicature of “Alice jumped”,\nthen we should not understand (16a) and (16b) as having the same truth\nconditions. Yet we do, Carston believes. The alleged implicature seems\nto fall within the scope of the logical operator, something she\nbelieves an implicature would not\n do.[68] \nW. Davis (2016a: §5.3) replies as follows.  A speaker who used\n (15a)\n to mean\n [15b]\n would just as naturally use (16a) to mean [16b], and hearers would\nunderstand the speaker accordingly. But what the speaker said\nis not entailed by [16b]. What the speaker of (16a) said would be\nfalse in circumstances in which Alice was unlikely to jump off the\ncliff if she jumped. Hearers would focus on what the speaker meant,\nthough, which would be true even in those circumstances. Since the\nspeaker meant one thing [16b] by saying something else [16a], the\nspeaker implicates [16b]. The speaker does not\nimplicate anything by uttering the antecedent of (16a). The speaker\nsays something only by uttering the whole conditional. So there is\nreally no embedding of implicatures when (16a) is uttered. The relationship between\n (15)\n and (16) is special. In many other cases in which a sentence\n“p” conversationally implicates\n“q”, the conditional “If p then\nr” does not implicate “If p and\nq then r”. For example, If Bill got some\nproblems wrong, he might have gotten them all wrong does not\nimplicate “If Bill got some but not all problems wrong, he might\nhave gotten them all wrong”. \nA lively debate between Relevance theorists and neo-Griceans concerns\nnumerical claims. \nAll parties agree that a speaker can use (17) to mean either [17a] or\n[17b]. Horn (1972) and Levinson (2000: 87–90) further agree with\nCarston that (17) itself is unambiguous. But whereas the neo-Griceans\nhold that (17) means [17a] rather than [17b], Carston (1988:\n46–7) maintains that (17) means neither but can be used to say\nboth. So the neo-Griceans hold that (17) always says [17a] while\nsometimes implicating [17b]. Carston holds that (17) is sometimes used\nto explicate [17a] and sometimes [17b]; neither is an implicature. The\nthesis that sentence meaning leaves open what is said to this extent\nis called semantic underdetermination. \nWhile still doubting that Carston’s view can fully account for\ncardinals, Horn (1989: 250–1; 2010: 314–5) now concludes\nthat they do not behave like quantifiers. For example, if you know\nthat everyone passed, you must answer “Did some students\npass?” with “Yes”. But if you know that Peter has\ntwo children, you cannot answer “Does Peter have one\nchild?” without knowing whether the speaker meant “at\nleast” or “exactly”. Indeed, a strong case can be\nmade that (17) is ambiguous, so that\nNeo-Gricean and Relevance accounts are both wrong. \nFollowing Sperber & Wilson (1986a: 182), Carston (2004b: 635)\nlater defines an explicature as a development of a logical form\nencoded by the sentence uttered, and an implicature as any proposition\ncommunicated by an utterance that is not an\n explicature.[69]\n The technical terms “development” and “logical\nform” are understood in such a way that [15b] is a development\nof [15a]. Thus understood, “explicature” covers much more\nthan what is said, and “implicature” covers much less than\nwhat is implicated as defined in\n §1. \nBach (1994: 160) uses “say” even more strictly than Grice,\nmeaning “strictly, literally, and explicitly\nsay”. Since the speaker of\n (15a)\n did not explicitly say\n [15b],\n Bach counts “The speaker said that Alice jumped off the\ncliff” as false. Bach (1994: 125–6, 140–1; 2006:\n28–9) agrees with Carston, though, in withholding the term\n“implicature” when what the speaker means is an\n“expansion” or “completion” of what is said.\nBach introduces the term impliciture (with “i”\nrather than “a” after soft “c”) to cover such\ncases. Bach restricts “implicature” to cases in which what\nis meant is “completely separate” from what is said. \nA thesis attributed to Grice is that what S says is\ndetermined by “decoding”, while what S\nconversationally implicates is determined by what S says\ntogether with an inferential, pragmatic mechanism (see, e.g., Sperber\n& Wilson 1986a: 182). An alleged problem, called\n“Grice’s Circle” (Levinson 2000: 173–4,\n186–7), is that many of the processes involved in figuring out\nwhat is said, such as reference identification and ambiguity\nresolution, “involve exactly those inferential mechanisms that\ncharacterize Gricean\n pragmatics”.[70]\n Grice never talked about decoding however, and observed himself that\nconversational principles are involved in determining what is said\n(Grice 1957: 222). For example, if an ambiguous term is used, we\nnaturally assume—in the absence of specific\ncounterevidence—that the intended meaning is the one relevant to\nthe conversation. In a discussion of snow, “There is a large\nbank on Main Street” is naturally interpreted as referring to a\nsnow bank. \nThere is no circle on Grice’s view because what is said is the\nconclusion of one pragmatic inference, and is one of the premises in a\nfurther pragmatic inference to what is\n implicated.[71]\n The process is serial rather than parallel, although later\nconclusions may always lead to adjustment of earlier conclusions. \nW. Davis (2016a: Ch. 2) describes ways of\nexplaining and inferring conversational implicatures that do not rely\non conversational principles. The methods he proposes for speaker\nimplicature are described in this section and for sentence implicature\nin the next. \nFor a speaker to implicate something is for the speaker to mean\nsomething by saying something else\n (§1).\n It is generally agreed that what a speaker means is determined by the\nspeaker’s intentions. When Steve utters “Kathryn\nis a Russian teacher”, whether Steve means that Kathryn is a\nteacher of Russian nationality or a teacher of the Russian language,\nand whether he is speaking literally or ironically, depends entirely\non what Steve intends to convey. What “convey” means\nprecisely is controversial, but is an independent\n issue.[72] \nWe most commonly explain why people do A with the intention\nof doing B by explaining why they believe they will do\nB by doing A, or why they want to do B. We\ncan explain why speakers intend to convey a thought by uttering a\nsentence that says something else in the same ways. Why do speakers\nbelieve they can convey thoughts by means of the various figures and\nmodes of speech identified in\n §4?\n One reason is that they have seen others doing so. Knowledge of the\ncommon forms of implicature is acquired along with knowledge of the\nsemantics and syntax of our native language. Speakers pick up figures\nand modes of speech from other speakers, as they learn vocabulary and\ngrammar. After speakers have become proficient, their own past success\nin using figures and modes of speech is a reason for them to believe\nthey will succeed again. Knowledge of both figures and modes is as\ntacit as our knowledge of syntax and semantics. It is not knowledge of\nfacts that define a language, but of how a language is used and\nunderstood. Since the figures and modes do not depend on a particular\nlanguage, they can be used with any language. \nWhy do speakers want to engage in implicature? The main reasons are\nthe reasons speakers make statements: to communicate, express\nthemselves, and record their thoughts. These goals may serve to\ncooperate with others, or to oppose them. What goals are served by\nimplicating rather than saying something? One is verbal efficiency\n(Levinson 2000: 28–31; Camp 2006: 3; Wilson & Sperber 2012:\n62): through implicature we express two or more thoughts by uttering\njust one sentence. Another is to mislead without lying (Horn 2010:\n§4; 2017). People often wish others to believe things that are\nfalse, and not only in situations of conflict and competition. And\nthey nearly always prefer misleading to\n lying.[73]\n The greater deniability of implicature, and the fact that it enables\nus to veil our intentions, are often motivating factors (Brown &\nLevinson 1978: 137; Pinker 2007). We observed in\n §10\n how implicature promotes the goals of style and politeness. \nIt should also be recognized that people perform many even highly\nskilled actions automatically, spontaneously, or habitually. Such\nactions are done without deliberation or conscious planning. What\nspeakers implicate as well as what they say commonly falls in this\ncategory. \nGiven that speaker meaning is a matter of speaker intention, it\nfollows that speaker implicatures can be recognized or predicted by\nthe methods we use to infer intentions from behavior, including\nabduction, analogy, and testimony. In example\n (2),\n Carla may suspect that Don means the weather is bad because irony is\na common linguistic device\n (§4),\n and Don has been ironic in similar situations before. Don’s\nintonation may be a clue. On the other hand, if Don rarely speaks\nfiguratively when reporting in, Carla may infer that he meant what he\n said.[74] \nConversational principles can play the same indirect role in\nimplicature recognition that known tendencies or goals play in\ninductive inference generally. Since speakers commonly observe the\nCooperative Principle, and hearers know this in a vague and tacit sort\nof way, hearers tend to assume that particular speakers are\ncooperating, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. If the\nhypothesis that Barb means she is not going to Paul’s party in\n example (1)\n fits better with the assumption that she is being cooperative than\nthe hypothesis that she is not answering the question, Alan may by abduction infer\nshe is implicating that. Further support for the\nhypothesis may be provided by the recollection that other speakers\nhave implicated similar things in similar circumstances before. The\nfact that relevance implicature is a common practice thus provides\nanalogical evidence\n (§4).\n Recognition of an unconventional form of implicature is more\ndifficult, but no harder than recognizing when a speaker is using a\nsentence with an unconventional meaning. As Sterelny (1982:\n192–3) observed, knowledge of the particular speaker is\nultimately more important than knowledge of non-universal\ngeneralizations. \nWhen S is being uncooperative, we have to use other\ngeneralizations or analogies. We are familiar with the ways defendants\nmanipulate language in an effort to avoid self-incrimination. \nWhereas what a speaker implicates depends on the particular\nspeaker’s intentions, what a sentence implicates on\nDavis’s theory depends on the conventions of the community of\nspeakers who use the language. To know or explain sentence\nimplicatures is to know or explain the relevant conventions. This is\nas true of generalized conversational implicatures as it is of\nimplicatures that are conventional in Grice’s sense\n(§2). \nWhen Grice talked about conventional implicatures he was referring to\nsemantic implicatures, like [3c]. These exist because of\nconventions that give individual words or syntactic structures their\nmeanings. The queen is English and therefore brave implicates\n“Being brave follows from being English” because it is\nconventional for English speakers to use “therefore” with\na certain meaning, which determines the implicature. A\nconversational sentence implicature is not determined by the\nmeaning of the sentence used, even when sentences with the same form\nare conventionally used with that implicature. It is a second-order\nconvention: a convention to use a sentence of a given form with an\nimplicature that is not part of its meaning. The common modes and\nfigures of speech are also second-order conventions, but not\nrestricted to sentences with a particular form. A language is defined\nby first-order lexical and syntactic conventions, not by second-order\nimplicature conventions. In this respect conversational implicature\nconventions are like naming conventions, word formation rules,\nintonation rules, speech act rituals (e.g., saying “This is\nN” when answering a telephone), and indirect speech act\nconventions (e.g., asking “Can I get an N?” to\nrequest an\n N).[75]\n Second-order conventions are not as arbitrary, though, because there\nis always some antecedent relation between what the sentence means and\nthe implicature that makes it natural to use one to convey the other.\nImplicature conventions promote style, politeness, and efficiency as\nwell as communication. \nLike other second-order linguistic conventions, conversational\nimplicature conventions differ in their cross-linguistic spread.\nWhereas the quantity implicature of “some” has been found\nin all observed languages (Horn 1989), common metaphors differ as much\nfrom language to language as the idioms that evolve from them do. The\nfact that regularities in implicature obtain cross-linguistically is\ncompatible with their being arbitrary and conventional. Witness the\npractice of using “?” and rising intonation to mark\nquestions. Why some implicatures are common to more languages than\nothers is an open question on any view. To the extent that\nimplicatures are conventional, it is a question for historical\nlinguistics. \nKnowledge of sentence implicatures is a crucial component of\nlinguistic\n competence.[76]\n Speakers unaware of them are likely to mislead their audience.\nImagine the possibilities if an oblivious speaker said Your\nhusband saw a woman to the subject’s wife. Hearers without\nsuch knowledge are likely to either misinterpret or fail to fully\nunderstand the speaker. Sentence implicatures, both semantic and\nconversational, resemble idioms and figures of speech in being picked\nup by native speakers from other speakers in the course of learning\nthe language. Sentence implicatures thus perpetuate themselves from\none generation to the next as sentence meanings do. Recent metaphors\nare special in being picked up by adults, and are liable to become\nidioms if they pass on to new generations. \nAn impressive body of research has attempted to discern general\nregularities in the multitude of conversational implicature\nconventions associated with a language. Wierzbicka (1985, 2003) has\nstudied how implicature conventions reflect broader “cultural\nscripts”. Others study how the implicatures of a sentence are\nrelated to the implicatures of compound sentences in which the\nsentence is embedded (Gazdar 1979; Levinson 2000: §2.5.1;\nSauerland & Stateva 2007)—the question raised by example\n (16). \nThe most influential work on conversational implicature conventions\ndescribes “Horn scales”.[77]\n Horn (1972, 1989) observed that the quantifiers all, most, many,\nsome form a scale with the following properties. Instances of\n“___ S are P” with one term entail\ninstances with any term to the right, but not to the left; the terms\nare thus ordered by logical strength. Moreover, the result of\nsubstituting one term implicates the denial of the result of\nsubstituting any term to the left, but not to the right. In the\nnegative context “It is not the case that ___ S are\nP”, the logical and pragmatic relations are reversed.\nOther Horn scales are 〈necessarily, actually,\npossibly〉, 〈certainly, probably,\npossibly〉, and 〈must, should, may〉. Horn\n(1989: §4.5) correlates the existence of scales with the absence\nof certain lexical items, such as a quantifier meaning “not\n all”.[78]\n Levinson (2000: 156) looked for a generalization that would cover\nthese cases but not scales like 〈Over 90%, over 10%,\nsome〉 which have the same logical relations as Horn scales\nbut not the pragmatic relations. One generalization is that the items\non a Horn scale are widely and frequently used monolexemes. A\ncompanion problem is to explain why some common monolexemes with\nsimilar logical relations lack the pragmatic relations, as\nseveral illustrates. Given the conventional nature of\ngeneralized conversational implicatures, there may be no systematic\n(“synchronic”) explanation. All languages are\n“irregular” to some extent. For example, the regular\npattern for adjectives in English is that of tall, taller,\ntallest. But there are exceptions, such as good, better,\nbest. No one expects that anything other than a historical\n(“diachronic”) explanation exists for these facts. \nThe literature on implicature is enormous and still growing. This\nentry, regrettably, had to ignore many valuable contributions.","contact.mail":"davisw@georgetown.edu","contact.domain":"georgetown.edu"}]
