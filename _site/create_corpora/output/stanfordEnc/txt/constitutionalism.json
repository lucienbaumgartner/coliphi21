This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of\ninterest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the\nlegal and philosophical foundations of the state. How can a government\nbe legally limited if law is the creation of government? Does this\nmean that a government can be ‘self-limiting’? Is this\neven possible? If not, then is there some way of avoiding this\nimplication? If meaningful limitation is indeed to be possible,\nperhaps constitutional constraints must somehow be\n‘entrenched’, that is, resistant to change or removal by\nthose whose powers are constrained? Perhaps they must not only be\nentrenched, but enshrined in written rules. If so, how are these rules\nto be interpreted? In terms of their original, public meaning or the\nintentions of their authors, or in terms of the, possibly\never-developing, values and principles they express? How, in the end,\none answers these questions depends crucially on how one conceives the\nnature, identity and authority of constitutions. Must a constitution\nestablish a stable framework for the exercise of public power which is\nin some way fixed by factors like original public meaning or\nauthorial intentions? Or can it be a living entity which\ngrows and develops in tandem with changing political values and\nprinciples? These and other such questions are explored below.\n\nIn some minimal sense of the term, a constitution consists of a set of\nnorms (rules, principles or values) creating, structuring, and\npossibly defining the limits of, government power or authority.\nUnderstood in this way, all states have constitutions and all states\nare constitutional states. Anything recognizable as a state must have\nsome means of constituting and specifying the limits (or lack thereof)\nplaced upon the three basic forms of government power: legislative\npower (making new laws), executive power (implementing laws) and\njudicial power (adjudicating disputes under\n laws).[1]\n Take the extreme case of an absolute sovereign, Rex, who combines\nunlimited power in all three domains. Suppose it is widely\nacknowledged that Rex has these powers, as well as the authority to\nexercise them at his pleasure. The constitution of this state might\nthen be said to contain only one rule, which grants unlimited power to\nRex. He is not legally answerable for the wisdom or morality\nof his decrees, nor is he bound by procedures, or any other kinds of\nlimitations or requirements, in exercising his powers. Whatever Rex\ndecrees is constitutionally valid. \nWhen scholars talk of constitutionalism, however, they normally mean\nsomething that rules out Rex’s case. They mean not only that there are\nnorms creating legislative, executive and judicial powers, but that\nthese norms impose significant limits on those\n powers.[2]\n Often these limitations are in the form of civil rights against\ngovernment, rights to things like free expression, association,\nequality and due process of law. But constitutional limits come in a\nvariety of forms. They can concern such things as the scope\nof authority (e.g., in a federal system, provincial or state\ngovernments may have authority over health care and education while\nthe federal government’s jurisdiction extends to national defence and\ntransportation); the mechanisms used in exercising the\nrelevant power (e.g., procedural requirements governing the form and\nmanner of legislation); and of course civil rights (e.g., in\na Charter or Bill of Rights). Constitutionalism in this richer sense\nof the term is the idea that government can/should be limited in its\npowers and that its authority depends on its observing these\nlimitations. In this richer sense of the term, Rex’s society has not\nembraced constitutionalism because the rule conferring his powers\nimpose no constitutional limits on them. Compare a second state in\nwhich Regina has all the powers possessed by Rex except that she lacks\nauthority to legislate on matters concerning religion. Suppose further\nthat Regina also lacks the power to implement, or to adjudicate on the\nbasis of, any law which exceeds the scope of her legislative\ncompetence. We have here the seeds of constitutionalism as that notion\nhas come to be understood in Western legal thought. \nIn discussing the history and nature of constitutionalism, a\ncomparison is often drawn between Thomas Hobbes and John Locke who are\nthought to have defended, respectively, the notion of constitutionally\nunlimited sovereignty (e.g., Rex) versus that of sovereignty limited\nby the terms of a social contract containing substantive limitations\n(e.g.,\n Regina).[3]\n But an equally good focal point is the English legal theorist John\nAustin who, like Hobbes, thought that the very notion of limited\nsovereignty is incoherent. For Austin, all law is the command of a\nsovereign person or body of persons, and so the notion that the\nsovereign could be limited by law requires a sovereign who is\nself-binding, who commands him/her/itself. But no one can command\nhimself, except in some figurative sense, so the notion of limited\nsovereignty is, for Austin (and Hobbes), as incoherent as the idea of\na square\n circle.[4]\n Though at one time this feature of Austin’s theory had some surface\nplausibility when applied to the British system of government, where\nParliament was often said to be supreme and constitutionally\n unlimited,[5]\n it faces obvious difficulty when applied to most other constitutional\ndemocracies such as one finds in the United States, Canada, Mexico and\nGermany, where it is abundantly clear that the powers of government\nare legally limited by a constitution. Austin’s answer to this\napparent weakness in his theory was to appeal to popular\nsovereignty, the idea that sovereign power ultimately resides in\n‘the people’, that is, the population at large.\nGovernment bodies—e.g., Parliament, the President or\nthe judiciary—can be limited by constitutional law, but the\nsovereign people remain unlimited in their powers to command. Whether\nthis appeal to popular sovereignty provides Austin with an adequate\nmeans of dealing with constitutional democracies is questionable. For\nAustin’s sovereign is supposed to be a determinate individual or group\nof individuals whose commands to the bulk of the population\nconstitute law. But if we identify the commanders with the people\nthemselves, then we seem inexorably led to the paradoxical result\nidentified by H.L.A. Hart—the commanders are commanding the\ncommanders. In short, we lapse into incoherence (Hart 1994,\n73–78; Austin 1995, Lecture VI). \nThough there are serious difficulties inherent in Austin’s attempt to\nmake sense of the people’s ultimate sovereignty, his account, with all\nits weaknesses, does reveal the need to distinguish between two\ndifferent concepts: sovereignty and government. Roughly speaking, we\nmight define sovereignty as the possession of supreme (and\npossibly unlimited) normative power and authority over some domain,\nand government as those persons or institutions through whom\nthat sovereignty is exercised. Once some such distinction is drawn, we\nsee immediately that sovereignty might lie somewhere other than with\nthe government and those who exercise the powers of government. And\nonce this implication is accepted, we can coherently go on to speak of\nlimited government coupled with unlimited\nsovereignty. Arguably this is what one should say about constitutional\ndemocracies where the people’s sovereign authority is thought to be\nultimate and unlimited but the government bodies—e.g.,\nlegislatures, Presidents and courts—through whom that\nsovereignty is exercised on the people’s behalf are constitutionally\nlimited and subordinate. As Locke might have said, unlimited\nsovereignty remains with the people who have the normative power to\nvoid the authority of their government (or some part thereof) if it\nexceeds its constitutional limitations. \nThough sovereignty and government are different notions, and normally\napply to different entities, it nevertheless seems conceptually\npossible for them to apply to one and the same individual or\ninstitution. It is arguable that Hobbes insisted on the identification\nof sovereign and government insofar as he seemed to require a\n(virtually) complete transfer of all rights and powers from sovereign\nindividuals to a political sovereign whose authority was to be\nabsolute, thus rendering it possible to emerge from the wretched state\nof nature in which life is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\n short.”[6]\n In Hobbes’ theory, ultimate, unlimited sovereignty must reside in the\nsupreme governmental person or body who enjoys unlimited power and\nauthority to rule the commonwealth. Anything less than such an\nultimate, unlimited sovereign would, given human nature and the world\nwe inhabit, destroy the potential for stable government and all that\nit makes possible. So even if ‘sovereignty’ and\n‘government’ express different notions, this neither means\nnor implies that the two could not pertain to one and the same\nentity. \nAccording to most theorists, another important feature of\nconstitutionalism is that the norms imposing limits upon government\npower must be in some way, and to some degree, be entrenched,\neither legally or by way of constitutional\n convention.[7]\n In other words, those whose powers are constitutionally\nlimited—i.e., the institutions of government—must not be\nconstitutionally at liberty to change or expunge those limits at their\npleasure. Most written constitutions contain amending formulae which\ncan be triggered by, and require the participation of, the government\nbodies whose powers they limit. But these formulae invariably require\nsomething more than a simple decision on the part of the present\ngovernment, through e.g., Presidential fiat or simple majority vote in\nthe legislature, to invoke a change. Sometimes constitutional\nassemblies are required, or super-majority votes, referendums, or the\nagreement of not only the central government in a federal system but\nalso some number or percentage of the governments or regional units\nwithin the federal\n system.[8]\n Entrenchment not only facilitates a degree of stability and\npredictability over time (a characteristic aspiration of\nconstitutional regimes), it is arguably a requirement of the very\npossibility of constitutionally limited government. Were a\ngovernment institution entitled, at its pleasure, to change the very\nterms of its constitutional limitations, we might begin to question\nwhether there would, in reality, be any such limitations. Consider\nRegina once again. Were she entitled, at her discretion, to remove\n(and perhaps later reinstate) the constitutional restriction\npreventing her from legislating on some religious matter on which she\nhad strong views, then it is perhaps questionable whether Regina could\nsensibly be said to be bound by this\n requirement.[9]\n On the other hand, were there a constitutional rule or convention\nspecifying that Regina is entitled to remove this restriction only if\nshe succeeds in convincing two thirds of her subjects to vote for the\nchange, then one might feel more comfortable speaking of\nconstitutional limitation. Of course this constitutional meta-rule or\nconvention is itself subject to change or elimination—a fact\nthat raises a host of further puzzles. For example, does such an act\nrequire application of the very rule in question—i.e., two\nthird’s majority vote—or are the sovereign people of Regina’s\nsociety at liberty to change or expunge it at their pleasure?\nIf we accept (a) the distinction between government and sovereignty\nurged above; (b) that ultimate sovereignty resides in the people whom\nRegina governs; and (c) that sovereignty cannot be self-limiting,\n(X cannot limit X) then we might sensibly be led to\nconclude that the constitutional meta-rule—and hence the\nconstitutional regime of which it is an integral part—both exist\nat the pleasure of the general population of Regina’s society.\nEntrenchment may be an essential element of constitutional regimes,\nbut it would seem that constitutions neither can nor should be\nentrenched against the actions of a sovereign people. \nSome scholars believe that constitutional norms do not exist unless\nthey are in some way enshrined in a written document (e.g., Rubenfeld\n1998). But most accept that constitutions (or elements of them) can be\nunwritten, and cite, as an obvious example of this possibility, the\nconstitution of the United Kingdom. One must be careful here, however.\nThough the UK has nothing resembling the American Constitution and its\nBill of Rights, it nevertheless contains a number of written\ninstruments which have, for many centuries, formed central elements of\nits constitution. Magna Carta (1215 C.E.) is perhaps the earliest\ndocument of the British constitution, while others include The\nPetition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689). Furthermore,\nconstitutional limits are also said to be found in certain principles\nof the common law, explicitly cited in landmark cases concerning the\nlimits of government power. The fact remains, however, that\nhistorically the constitution of the UK has largely taken unwritten\nform, suggesting strongly that writtenness is not a defining feature\nof constitutionalism. \nWhy, despite the existence of seemingly obvious counter-examples,\nmight someone be led to think that constitutional norms must be\nwritten rules, as opposed to more informal conventions or social\nrules? One possible\n reason[10]\n is that unwritten rules and conventions are sometimes less precise\nand therefore more open to interpretation, gradual change, and\nultimately avoidance, than written ones. If this were true, then one\nmight question whether an unwritten rule could, at least as a\npractical matter, serve adequately to limit government power. But\nthere is no reason to accept this line of argument. Long standing\nsocial rules and conventions are often clear and precise, as well as\nmore rigid and entrenched than written ones, if only because their\nelimination, alteration or re-interpretation typically requires\nwidespread changes in traditional attitudes, beliefs and behaviour.\nAnd these can be very difficult to bring about. \nDoes the idea of constitutionalism require, as a matter of conceptual\nor practical necessity, the division of government powers urged by\nMontesquieu and celebrated by Americans as a bulwark against abuse of\nstate power? In Regina’s case, there is no such separation:\nlegislative, executive and judicial power all reside in her person.\nBut how, it might be asked, can she be the one (qua judge) who\ndetermines whether her legislation satisfies the prescribed\nconstitutional limitation? Even if, in theory, Regina’s\nconstitution prohibits her from removing her constitutional\nrestriction at will (because she must observe the 2/3rds meta-rule)\ncan she not always choose to ignore her restrictions, or to interpret\nthem so as to escape their binding force? Perhaps Bishop Hoadly was\nright when he said (1717) in a sermon before the English King:\n“Whoever hath an ultimate authority to interpret any written or\nspoken laws, it is he who is truly the Law-giver to all intents and\npurposes, and not the person who first wrote or spoke them.”\n(quoted in Gray 1986, p.12). Although some constitutional limits,\ne.g., the one which restricts the Mexican President to a single term\nof office, seldom raise questions of interpretation, many others\n(particularly those that concern civil rights) are ripe for such\nquestions. Regina might argue that a decree requiring all shops to\nclose on Sundays (the common Sabbath) does not concern a religious\nmatter because its aim is a common day of rest, not religious\nobservance. Others might argue, with seemingly equal plausibility,\nthat it does concern a religious matter and therefore lies outside\nRegina’s legislative competence.  \nThat constitutions often raise such interpretive questions gives rise\nto an important question: Does the possibility of constitutional\nlimitation on legislative and executive power require, as a matter of\npractical politics, that the judicial power by which such limitations\nare interpreted and enforced reside in some individual or group of\nindividuals distinct from that in which these legislative and\nexecutive powers are vested? In modern terms, must constitutional\nlimits on a legislative body like Parliament, the Duma or Congress, or\nan executive body like the President or her Cabinet, be subject to\ninterpretation and enforcement by an independent judiciary?\nMarbury v Madison settled this question in the affirmative as\na matter of American law, and most nations follow Marbury\n(and Montesquieu) in accepting the practical necessity of some such\narrangement. But it is not clear that the arrangement truly is\npractically necessary, let alone conceptually so. Bishop Hoadly\nnotwithstanding, there is nothing nonsensical in the suggestion that\nX might be bound by an entrenched rule, R, whose\ninterpretation and implementation is left to X. This is,\narguably, the situation in New Zealand where the courts are forbidden\nfrom striking down legislation on the ground that it exceeds\nconstitutional limits. Observance and enforcement of these limits are\nleft to the legislative bodies whose powers are nonetheless recognized\nas constitutionally limited (and subject to whatever pressures might\nbe imposed politically when state actions are generally believed to\nviolate the constitution). It is important to realize that what rule,\nR, actually requires is not necessarily identical with what\nX believes or says that it requires. Nor is it identical with\nwhatever restrictions X actually observes in practice. This\nis so even when there is no superior institution with the power and\nauthority to enforce compliance or to correct X’s judgment\nwhen it is, or appears to be, wrong. \nThat constitutional limits can sometimes be avoided or interpreted so\nas to avoid their effects, and no recourse be available to correct\nmistaken interpretations and abuses of power, does not, then, imply\nthe absence of constitutional limitation. But does it imply the\nabsence of effective limitation? Perhaps so, but even here\nthere is reason to be cautious in drawing general conclusions. Once\nagain, we should remember the long-standing traditions within British\nParliamentary systems (including New Zealand’s) according to which\nParliament alone possesses final authority to create, interpret and\nimplement its own constitutional limits. And whatever their faults,\nthere is little doubt that many Parliaments modeled on the British\nsystem typically act responsibly in observing their own constitutional\nlimits. \nThe idea of constitutionalism requires limitation on government power\nand authority established by constitutional law. But according to most\nconstitutional scholars, there is more to a constitution than\nconstitutional law. Many people will find this suggestion puzzling,\nbelieving their constitution to be nothing more (and nothing less)\nthan (usually) a formal, written document, possibly adopted at a\nspecial constitutional assembly, which contains the nation’s supreme,\nfundamental law. But there is a long-standing tradition of conceiving\nof constitutions as containing much more than constitutional law.\nDicey is famous for proposing that, in addition to constitutional law,\nthe British constitutional system contains a number of constitutional\nconventions which effectively limit government in the absence of legal\nlimitation. These are, in effect, social rules arising within the\npractices of the political community and which impose\nimportant, but non-legal, limits on government powers. An\nexample of a British constitutional convention is the rule that the\nQueen may not refuse Royal Assent to any bill passed by both Houses of\nthe UK Parliament. Perhaps another example lies in a convention that\nindividuals chosen to represent the State of Florida in the American\nElectoral College (the body which actually chooses the American\nPresident by majority vote) must vote for the Presidential candidate\nfor whom a plurality of Floridians voted on election night. Owing to\nthe fact that they are political conventions, unenforceable in courts\nof law, constitutional conventions are said to be distinguishable from\nconstitutional laws, which can indeed be legally enforced. If we\naccept Dicey’s distinction, we must not identify the constitution with\nconstitutional law. It includes constitutional conventions as well. We\nmust further recognize the possibility that a government, though\nlegally within its power to embark upon a particular course\nof action, might nevertheless be constitutionally prohibited\nfrom doing\n so.[11]\n It is possible that, as a matter of constitutional law, Regina might\nenjoy unlimited legislative, executive and judicial powers which are\nnonetheless limited by constitutional conventions specifying how those\npowers are to be exercised. Should she violate one of these\nconventions, she would be acting legally, but unconstitutionally, and\nher subjects might well feel warranted in condemning her actions,\nperhaps even removing her from office—a puzzling result only if\none thinks that all there is to a constitution is constitutional\nlaw. \nAs we have just seen, there is often more to a constitution than\nconstitutional law. As we have also seen, constitutional norms need\nnot always be written rules. Despite these important observations, two\nfacts must be acknowledged: (1) the vast majority of constitutional\ncases hinge on questions of constitutional law; and (2) modern\nconstitutions consist primarily of written\n documents.[12]\n Consequently, constitutional cases often raise theoretical issues\nconcerning the proper approach to the interpretation of written\ninstruments—colored, of course, by the special role\nconstitutions play – or ought to play – in defining and limiting the\nauthority and powers of government. Differences of view on these\nmatters come to light most forcefully when a case turns on the\ninterpretation of a constitutional provision that deals with abstract\ncivil rights (e.g., the right to due process of law, or to\n equality).[13]\n How such provisions are to be interpreted has been subject to intense\ncontroversy among legal practitioners and theorists. As we shall see,\nstark differences of opinion on this issue are usually rooted in\ndifferent views on the aspirations of constitutions or on the\nappropriate role of judges within constitutional democracies. \nTheories of constitutional interpretation come in a variety of forms,\nbut they all seem, in one way or another, to ascribe importance to a\nnumber of key factors: textual or semantic meaning; political, social\nand legal history; intention; original understanding; and\nmoral/political theory. The roles played by each of these factors in a\ntheory of constitutional interpretation depend crucially on how the\ntheorist conceives of a constitution and its role in limiting\ngovernment power. Simplifying somewhat, there are two main rival views\non this question. On the one side, we find theorists who view a\nconstitution as foundational law whose principal point is to\nfix a long-standing framework within which legislative,\nexecutive and judicial powers are to be exercised by the various\nbranches of government. Such theorists will tend towards\ninterpretative theories which accord pride of place to factors like\nthe intentions of those who created the\nconstitution, or the original public understandings\nof the words chosen for inclusion in the constitution. On such a\nfixed view of constitutions, it is natural to think that\nfactors like these should govern whenever they are clear and\nconsistent. And the reason is quite straight forward. From this\nperspective, a constitution not only aspires to establish a framework\nwithin which government powers are to exercised, it aspires to\nestablish one which is above, or removed from, the deep disagreements\nand partisan controversies encountered in ordinary, day to day law and\npolitics. It aspires, in short, to be both stable and morally\nand politically neutral. To be clear, in saying that a\nconstitution aspires, on a fixed view, to be morally and politically\nneutral, I in no way mean to deny that those who take this stance\nbelieve that it expresses a particular political vision or a set of\nfundamental commitments to certain values and principles of political\nmorality. Quite the contrary. All constitutional theorists will agree\nthat constitutions typically enshrine, indeed entrench, a range of\nmoral and political commitments to values like democracy, equality,\nfree expression, and the rule of law. But two points need to be\nstressed. \nFirst, fixed views attempt to transform questions about the moral and\npolitical soundness of these commitments into historical questions,\nprincipally concerning beliefs about their soundness. The\ntask is not to ask: What do we now think about values like\nequality and freedom of expression? Rather, it is to ask: What did\nthey—the authors of the constitution or those on whose\nauthority they created the constitution—in fact think about\nthose values? What was their original understanding of them,\nor the understanding among most members of the general population that\nexisted at the time of the constitution’s creation (or amendment, if\nthe provision in question was introduced at a later time)? So\nstability and neutrality are, on fixed views, served to the extent\nthat a constitution is capable of transforming questions of political\nmorality into historical ones. \nSecond, no proponent of the fixed view will deny that the abstract\nmoral commitments expressed in a constitution tend to be widely, if\nnot universally shared among members of the relevant political\ncommunity. In that sense, then, the constitution, despite the moral\ncommitments it embodies, is neutral as between citizens and their many\nmore partisan differences of opinion on more particular moral\nquestions. Not everyone in a modern, constitutional democracy like the\nUS or Germany agrees on the extent to which the right to free\nexpression demands the liberty to express opinions that display and\npromote hatred toward an identifiable religious or racial group. But\nvirtually no one would deny the vital importance of expressive freedom\nin a truly free and democratic society. On fixed views, then,\nconstitutions can be seen as analogous to the ground rules of a\ndebating society. Each sets the mutually agreed, stable framework\nwithin which controversial debate (and action) is to take place. And\njust as a debating society could not function if its ground rules were\nconstantly open to debate and revision at point of application, a\nconstitution could not serve its role if its terms were constantly\nopen to debate and revision by participants within the political and\nlegal processes it aspires to govern. We avoid this result, according\nto those whose espoused the fixed view, to the extent that we are able\nto replace controversial moral and political questions with historical\nquestions about the intentions of constitutional authors in creating\nwhat they did, or about how the language they chose to express a\nconstitutional requirement was publicly understood at the time it was\nchosen. \nTo sum up: the desire for stability and neutrality leads modern\nproponents of the fixed view to view constitutional interpretation as\nan exercise which, when undertaken properly, focuses on authors’\nintentions or on original understandings of the meaning and import of\nthe words chosen to express agreed limits on government power and\nauthority. Only if interpreters restrict themselves to such factors,\nand do not attempt to insert their own contentious views under the\nguise of ‘interpretation’, can the role of a constitution\nbe secured. Only then can it serve as the politically neutral, stable\nframework its nature demands. Theorists who espouse this particular\nview of constitutional interpretation are generally called\n‘originalists’. \nNot all constitutional theorists believe that the sole or overriding\nrole of a constitution is to set a stable, neutral framework for the\nrough and tumble of partisan law and politics. Nor do all theorists\nbelieve that constitutional interpretation consists of an attempt to\nascertain original understandings or authorial intentions. On the\ncontrary, many constitutional scholars embrace living\nconstitutionalism, an approach that sees a constitution as an\nevolving, living entity which, by its very nature, is capable of\nresponding to changing social circumstances and new (and it is hoped\nbetter) moral and political beliefs. Along with this very different\nview of constitutions come very different theories regarding the\nnature and limits of legitimate constitutional interpretation. One\nstrand within living constitutionalism, upon which we will be focus\nbelow, stresses the extent to which constitutional interpretation\nresembles the kind of reasoning that takes place in other areas of the\nlaw pertaining to common law legal systems, such as the law of\ncontracts and torts. Just as the law of contributory negligence\nemerged and evolved in common law countries in a case-by-case,\nincremental manner, over many decades and as the product of many\njudicial decisions, the law of equal protection, free expression, due\nprocess and the like has evolved in modern western democracies as\nconstitutional cases have been decided over the years. \nDisputes between originalists and living constitutionalists are among\nthe liveliest and most contentious to have arisen in constitutional\nscholarship over the past several decades. Debates have tended to\nfocus on abstract civil rights provisions of constitutions, such as\nthe due process clause of the American Constitution, or Section 7 of\nthe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which “guarantees\nthe right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right\nnot to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of\nfundamental\n justice.”[14]\n Given the fixed view to which they are committed, contemporary\noriginalists view anything more than an attempt to discover, so as to\npreserve and apply, original understandings of such provisions as\nconstitutional revision or ‘construction’, often masquerading as the\ninterpretation of an unchanged\n original.[15]\n On the other side, we find the living constitutionalists who view\noriginalism as a reactionary, overly conservative theory serving only\nto tie a democratic community to the ‘dead hand of the\npast.’ Originalists, their opponents claim, render us incapable\nof responding rationally and responsibly to changing social\ncircumstances and improved moral views concerning the requirements of\nthe abstract values and principles articulated in modern\nconstitutions. Living constitutionalists, the originalist counters,\nrecommend constitutional practices that threaten a number of cherished\nvalues, among them the rule of law and the separation of powers. They\nare, in effect, happy to place the constitution in the hands of\ncontemporary judges who are licensed, under the guise of interpreting\nit, to change the constitution to suit their own political\ninclinations and moral preferences. And this, originalists claim, only\nserves to thwart cherished values secured by having a stable,\npolitically neutral constitution, and may render all talk of genuine\nconstitutional constraint meaningless. \n Originalism[16]\n comes in a wide variety of forms (Bork 1990; Scalia 1997; Whittington\n1999b; Barnett 2004; Solum 2008). An originalist might claim that her\nview follows necessarily from a more general theory of interpretation:\nto interpret is necessarily to retrieve something that\nexisted at the time of authorship—an original object. Another\nmight be happy to acknowledge that interpretation could,\ntheoretically, take the form of an innovative or\ncreative interpretation that evaluates or in some way changes\nan original, as might be the case with a revolutionary interpretation\nof a play or work of art. But such a theorist might go on to add that,\nfor reasons of political morality having to do with, e.g., the\nprinciples of democracy, the rule of law, and values underlying the\nseparation of powers, such innovative interpretations ought never be\npursued by constitutional interpreters. The object of constitutional\ninterpretation should, to the greatest extent possible, remain fixed\nby factors like original public understandings or authorial\nintentions. Yet another originalist might be content to leave a little\nleeway here, suggesting something like the following: though there is\na presumption, perhaps a very heavy one, in favor of interpretation as\nretrieval of an original, it is one which can, on very rare occasions,\nbe overcome. For example, this originalist might say that the\npresumption in favor of retrieval can be defeated when there is a\ndiscernible and profound sea change in popular views on some important\nissue of political morality implicated by an abstract constitutional\nprovision. This was arguably the case in the United States with\nrespect to slavery and equal protection. Presumably ‘equal\nprotection’ was originally understood, both by the authors of\nthe 14th Amendment and by the people on whose behalf they\nacted, as fully consistent with segregation. This concrete\nunderstanding of equal protection is now, of course, widely condemned.\nIts wholesale rejection served as the main inspiration behind\nBrown v. Board of Education, whose innovative interpretation\nof the equal protection clause arguably changed or replaced the\noriginal understanding of the\n notion.[17]\n Yet another concession, in this case one that seems embraced by all\noriginalists, concerns the force and effect of authoritative court\ninterpretations of the constitution. Many originalists believe that\nRoe v.\n Wade[18]\n rested on a mistaken interpretation of the United States\nConstitution, one that flew in the face of original understandings and\nintentions; but virtually no originalist will go so far as to deny\nthat any contemporary interpretation of the First, Fourth, Fifth,\nNinth and Fourteenth Amendments is justified only if it can be\nreconciled with that decision. In other words, virtually all\noriginalists agree that established precedent can sometimes trump\noriginal understanding. Whether this apparent concession is in the end\nconsistent with the spirit of originalism is, perhaps, questionable.\nSuch “faint-hearted originalism” (Scalia 1989) may reduce,\nin the end, to a form of living\n constitutionalism.[19]\n Indeed, as we shall see in the next section, the role of judicial\ninterpretations of abstract constitutional provisions is central to\nthat prominent form of living constitutionalism which views\nconstitutional interpretation as resting on a form of common-law\nreasoning. \nAnother way in which originalists have split is over the identity of\nthe original object of interpretation. One originalist might focus on\nthe retrieval of original public understandings of key constitutional\nphrases like ‘freedom of speech’, ‘the principles of fundamental\njustice’ or ‘cruel and unusual punishment’, while another might wish\ninterpreters to zero in on the original intentions of the relevant\nconstitutional authors. But one must be careful here. Original public\nunderstanding is likely to matter to this second originalist because\nthe primary means of conveying one’s intentions in the context of\nlegal enactment are the words one chooses to express one’s intentions.\nAnd those words cannot convey one’s intentions unless some standard\nmeaning or common understanding is assumed, a standard public meaning\nto which both authors and readers have access and in terms of which\nthe latter can, and are expected to, grasp the former’s intentions.\nBut that meaning or understanding cannot be anything other than the\noriginal one because authors do not have crystal balls and therefore\nhave no access to future understandings. So an original intention\ntheorist will inevitably have interpreters pay considerable attention\nto original public understandings – perhaps to the point that her\ntheory actually collapses into a form of public understanding\noriginalism. Similar things will be true of an originalist whose\nprincipal focus is original public understanding: she need not dismiss\nentirely the relevance of original intentions, at least in some cases.\nShould it turn out, for instance, that original public understanding\nleads to unforeseen applications or results that we have good\nhistorical evidence to believe the authors did not intend, or would\nhave flatly rejected had they known what we now know, an originalist\nmight allow such actual or hypothetical intentions to override\noriginal public understandings. \nAmong the ways in which one might be able to determine that\nconstitutional authors did not intend, or would not have wished to\nendorse, a particular concrete application or result suggested by the\noriginal public understanding of a constitutional provision is by\nappeal to the general goals or purposes we have\nreason to believe they intended to achieve in enacting what they did.\nSometimes these goals and purposes, often called further\nintentions, are explicitly expressed in the preamble to a\nconstitution, as is often true in the case of ordinary statutes. But\nsuch statements of purpose in constitutions tend to be very broad and\nhighly abstract and are often of very limited use in dealing with the\nmore specific questions that arise under particular constitutional\n provisions.[20]\n So appeal is sometimes made to official (and nonofficial) debates and\ndiscussions surrounding the drafting, adoption or ratification of the\nconstitution or of the particular provision in question. Sometimes\nappeal is even made to widely shared beliefs at the time on the\nrelevant issue. It’s virtually certain that hanging, for example, was\nwidely held in eighteenth-century America to be a quick and relatively\nhumane form of execution. Thus one might have very good historical\nreason to believe that it could not have been among the intentions of\nthe Eighth Amendment’s drafters to ban such a practice. An originalist\ninterpretation of that Amendment might draw support from this fact in\nan argument purporting to demonstrate the constitutional validity of\nhanging. \nBut perhaps things are not quite this simple. Suppose we agreed that\nthe goal of the Eighth Amendment’s authors was to ban cruel and\nunusual punishments, and that they, along with virtually every other\nAmerican of the day, believed that hanging did not fall within the\nextension of that phrase. In other words, what we might call their\nconcrete understanding of the abstract notion\n‘cruel and unusual punishment’, was such as to permit the\nuse of hanging. If so, and if a contemporary interpreter believes that\nall forms of capital punishment, including hanging, is in actual\nfact cruel and unusual, then she might fashion an argument of the\nfollowing sort, one which has, at least superficially, an originalist\nflavor. Respecting the general intentions of the authors—to ban\ncruel and unusual punishment—actually requires that\nhanging be deemed unconstitutional, even though the authors (and those\non whose authority they acted) would have rejected this claim.\nRecognizing the fallibility of their own moral views, the intentions\nof the authors of the Eighth Amendment might have been that government\nbodies observe an abstract, partly moral standard forbidding\ngovernments from acting in a manner properly characterized as cruel\nand unusual. This might actually have been their purpose in framing\nthe Eighth Amendment in the way that they did, as expressing an\nabstract principle as opposed to a more detailed provision listing the\nspecific kinds of concrete practices they wished to forbid, that is,\ntheir concrete understanding of ‘cruel and unusual\npunishment’. This is a concrete understanding they fully\nrealized could be wrong, and their aim or intention was not to\nenshrine this possibly erroneous understanding but to prohibit what\ntruly is cruel and unusual. Respecting their intentions under these\nconditions would, therefore, require holding as unconstitutional\nwhatever truly does come within the extension of the relevant\nprovision, that is, whatever truly does constitute penal behaviour\nthat is cruel and unusual. Imagine now that one could bring the\nauthors of the Eighth Amendment to life and that one could convince\nthem, via sound empirical and moral argument, that capital punishment\nin all its forms is in actual fact cruel and unusual. How might they\nrespond to the claim that the only way to respect their intentions is\nto continue to accept, as constitutional, the practice of hanging?\nTheir likely response would be to say: “We meant to ban\npunishments that are in actual fact cruel and unusual, not what we can\nnow see that we, along with virtually everyone else at the time,\nincorrectly understood that ban to entail. If we had wanted\nspecifically to ban only the things we thought at the time constitute\ncruel and unusual punishment, we would have chosen our words\ndifferently. We would have explicitly banned those things.”\nWhether appeal to intentions in this way is enough to render one an\noriginalist—if only a faint-hearted one—is perhaps\nquestionable, however. Such an appeal may well transform the resultant\ntheory of constitutional interpretation into something very close to a\nform of living\n constitutionalism.[21] \nIn any event, originalists can differ on the role, in constitutional\ninterpretation, of goals and purposes, often referred to as\nfurther intentions. An originalist might be prepared to allow\nsome further intentions to override original concrete understandings\nin some cases, while another might reject the use of such intentions\naltogether. One reason for the latter’s reluctance—and for the\nfocus by most contemporary originalists on ordinary public meaning, as\nopposed to original intentions—is likely to be that the\nhistorical evidence concerning the existence and content of such\nintentions tends to be highly unreliable or inaccessible to later\ninterpreters. One of the essential functions of law is the guidance of\nbehavior. Yet one cannot be guided by a law unless one understands it,\nknows what it means. And if its meaning depends on factors about which\nthere is great dispute, or which are largely inaccessible, as is quite\noften the case when it comes to the intentions of long-dead authors,\nthen one cannot be guided by the law. Hence, rule-of-law arguments can\nbe used to justify precluding (significant) appeal to authors’\nintentions (further or otherwise) in all but exceptional cases. A\nsecond reason for rejecting appeal to further intentions is the fact\nthat there is an important difference between what a constitution\nactually says or means and what those who created it might have wanted\nor intended to achieve in creating it. Interpretation is an attempt to\nretrieve so as to conserve or enforce the former, not the latter. \nOriginalism, as a general family of theories which ties constitutional\ninterpreters to original understandings and/or intentions, is subject\nto a number of objections. For example, original intentions and\nunderstandings are often very unclear, if not largely indeterminate,\nleaving the interpreter with the need to appeal to other\n factors.[22]\n Sometimes the only things upon which joint authors can agree are the\nwords actually chosen. Yet another serious difficulty faced by\noriginalism is one alluded to above: contemporary life is often very\ndifferent from the life contemplated by those who lived at the time of\nthe constitution’s adoption. As a result, many concrete applications\nor results suggested by original intentions and understandings may now\nseem absurd or highly undesirable in light of new scientific and\nsocial developments and improved moral understanding. Furthermore,\nmodern life includes countless situations that our predecessors could\nnot possibly have contemplated, let alone intended or meant to be\ndealt with in a particular way. The right to free speech that found\nits way into many constitutions in the early modern period could not\npossibly have been understood (or intended) by its defenders to\nencompass, e.g., pornography on the internet. \nIn response to this latter difficulty, an originalist might appeal to\nwhat might be called hypothetical intent or understanding.\nThe basic idea is that an interpreter should always consider, in cases\ninvolving new, unforeseen circumstances, the hypothetical question of\nwhat her predecessors would have intended or wanted\nto be done in the case at hand had they known what we now\nknow to be true. We are, on this view, to put ourselves imaginatively\nin the shoes of those who went before us. We are to determine, perhaps\nin light of their general beliefs, values and intended goals and\npurposes, and perhaps by way of analogy with concrete applications we\nhave reason to believe they clearly accepted at the time, what they\nwould have wanted done in the new circumstances we now face. But this\nmove is problematic. First, it presupposes that we can single out one,\nconsistent set of purposes, values and concrete applications\nattributable to our predecessors. Yet people invariably have different\nthings in mind even when they agree on a constitutional text. Some\nmight have believed that the right to free expression protects hate\nspeech, while others might thought that banning such speech\nconstitutes a justifiable limit on that right. Second, even if we\ncould single out an acceptable set of purposes, values and\napplications from which our hypothetical inquiry could proceed, it\nseems unlikely that there will always be a uniquely correct answer to\nthe counterfactual question of what the authors would have wanted or\nintended to be done in light of these factors. If so, then it is\nlikely that a modern interpreter will, in the end, have to be guided\nby his own moral views is selecting an answer to this counter-factual\nquestion. What the interpreter believes the authors would\nhave decided may well end up being nothing over and above what he\nbelieves they should decide were they with us today. \nSo we are left with the question of why we should speculate about what\na long-dead group of individuals might have intended or\nwanted done were they apprised of what we now know. The main appeal of\noriginalism is that it appears to tie constitutional interpretation to\nmorally neutral, historical facts about actual\nbeliefs, intentions and decisions of individuals with the\nlegitimate authority to settle fundamental questions concerning the\nproper shape and limits of government powers. If we are now to\nconsider, not what they did decide, believe or understand,\nbut what they should decide were they to exist today and know\nwhat we now know, then the main appeal of originalism vanishes. And so\nthe question naturally arises: Why not just forget this theoretically\nsuspect, counterfactual exercise and make the decisions ourselves? \nBut if we are not to be tied in these ways to the so-called dead hand\nof the past when we engage in constitutional interpretation, how are\nwe to proceed? The dominant alternative, living constitutionalism,\ntakes its inspiration from the difficulties in originalism sketched in\nthe preceding paragraphs. It does so by construing a\nconstitution—or at least those parts of it that incorporate\nabstract\n principles[23]—as\n a living entity whose limitations are sometimes open to revisiting\nand revision in light of those changing times and (one hopes) improved\nmoral/political understandings that tend to cause originalists so much\ntrouble. \nWhatever else might be said of law, this much is undeniably true:\nwhere law exists, our conduct is subject to various forms of\nrestriction. But in many instances, the relevant restrictions can be\nremoved or changed with minimal effort, as when a problematic\ncommon-law precedent is overturned because of changing social\ncircumstances, or a statute is repealed or amended because it no\nlonger serves useful purposes. Not so with constitutions. As noted\nabove, they tend to be heavily entrenched. Constitutions are also\nmeant to be long lasting, so as to serve the values of continuity and\nstability in the basic framework within which the contentious affairs\nof law and politics are conducted. The entrenched nature of\nconstitutions is largely unproblematic when we consider provisions dealing with\nsuch matters as the length of term of a senator or which branch of\ngovernment is responsible for regulating public education. But things\nget much more complicated and contentious when we turn to the highly\nabstract, moral provisions of most modern constitutions which have the\neffect of limiting the powers of government bodies in significant\nways. These special features of constitutions combine to give rise to\na fundamental question, one that causes the originalist so much\ndifficulty and to which living constitutionalism purports to provide a\nbetter answer: How can one group of people justifiably place\nentrenched constitutional impediments of a decidedly moral nature in\nthe way of a second group of people who might live in radically\ndifferent circumstances and perhaps with radically different moral\nviews? How, in short, can one generation legitimately bind the moral\nchoices of another? A satisfactory answer to this\nintergenerational problem, living constitutionalists contend,\nrequires that we recognize that constitutions can grow and adapt to\never-changing circumstances without losing their identity or their\nlegitimacy. \nAccording to living constitutionalists, the meaning or content of an\nentrenched provision like section 3(1) of the German Basic Law, which\nproclaims that “All persons shall be equal before the\nlaw,” consists in the rights or principles of political morality\nthey express, not what those rights or principles were generally\nunderstood to require at the time of enactment or were believed or\nintended to require by those who chose to include them in the\nconstitution. The choice to employ abstract moral terms (e.g.,\n‘cruel and unusual punishment’) instead of more concrete,\nnon-moral terms (e.g., ‘public hanging’ or ‘drawing\nand quartering’), is presumably made in recognition of at least\nfour crucial facts: (1) it’s important that governments not violate\ncertain important rights of political morality; (2) constitutional\nauthors do not always agree fully on what concretely is required in\nthe many scenarios and cases in which those rights are, or will later\nbe seen to be, relevant; (3) constitutional authors can anticipate\nneither the future nor the many scenarios and cases in which these\nimportant rights will be in some way relevant; and (4) even when they\ndo agree on what those rights concretely require at the moment of\nadoption, and are comfortable binding themselves and their\ncontemporaries to these concrete understandings, they are not\nparticularly comfortable doing so in respect of future generations who\nwill live in very different times and may think very differently. And\nso the decision is made to express constitutional commitments in very\nabstract terms—‘cruel and unusual punishment’ versus\n‘drawing and quartering’—leaving it to later\ngenerations to substitute their possibly different concrete\nunderstandings for those of the authors or those who lived at the time\nof authorship. The result is that as concrete understandings of the\nentrenched constitutional-rights provisions evolve, the results\nwarranted by these provisions can legitimately change right along with\nthem. And importantly for the living constitutionalist who does not\nwish to surrender to the charge that she counsels infidelity to the\nconstitution, these changes can occur without the constitution having\nchanged, as would be true were a process of formal amendment\nsuccessfully invoked and an abstract, rights provision removed from\nthe constitution. \nDespite its undoubted appeal, (at least to many) living\nconstitutionalism is subject to a number of significant objections.\nPerhaps the most prominent ones are these: (a) the theory renders all\ntalk of constitutional interpretation, properly understood as the\nretrieval of existing meaning, utterly senseless: constitutional\ninterpretation becomes nothing more than unconstrained, constitutional\ncreation or construction masquerading as interpretation; (b) living\nconstitutionalism robs the constitution of its ability to serve its\nguidance function—how can individuals be guided by a\nconstitution whose application to their conduct and choices will be\ndetermined by the unconstrained views of later so-called\ninterpreters?; and (c) living constitutionalism violates the\nseparation of powers doctrine—if the constitution and its limits\nbecome whatever contemporary interpreters take them to mean, and if\nthose interpreters tend to be found almost exclusively in courts\npopulated by individuals who were appointed not elected, then\ndemocratically unaccountable judges end up deciding what the proper\nlimits of government power shall be, a task for which they are\neminently unqualified and which ought to be reserved for individuals\n(e.g., the authors of the constitution) with the democratic authority\nto serve that function. Hence the appeal of originalism. \nLiving constitutionalists have a number of responses to these\nobjections. For instance, it might be argued that the theory in no way\nresults in the unconstrained, arbitrary exercise of judicial power its\nopponents often portray it to be. Living constitutionalists like\nStrauss (2010) and Waluchow (2007a) suggest that the ongoing\ninterpretation of a constitution’s abstract rights provisions is a\nprocess much like the process by which judges develop equally\nabstract, common-law notions like ‘negligence’ and\n‘the reasonable use of force.’ According to Strauss, the\nU.S. constitutional system \nOn this view, constitutional interpretation must accommodate itself to\nprevious attempts to interpret and apply the abstract rights\nprovisions expressed in the constitution’s text. These prior\ninterpretive decisions serve as constitutional precedents. And just as\nthe traditional rules of precedent combine respect for the (albeit\nlimited) wisdom and authority of previous decision makers (legislative\nand judicial) with an awareness of the need to allow adaptation in the\nface of changing views, and new or unforeseen circumstances, so too\nmust constitutional interpreters respect the wisdom and authority of\nprevious interpreters, while allowing the constitution to adapt so as\nto respond to changing views, and new or unforeseen circumstances.\nLiving constitutional interpretation, though flexible and adaptive, is\nno less constrained and disciplined than reasoning under common\nlaw. \nAnother response open to living constitutionalists is to deny that\ntheir theory of interpretation ignores the special role played by a\nconstitution’s text and its authors. The text plays a key role insofar\nas any constitutional interpretation, innovative as it may be, must be\nconsistent with that text, until such time as it is formally changed\nvia some acknowledged process of constitutional amendment. There is no\nreason to deny that original understandings of a constitution’s\nabstract provisions can also be highly relevant to later\ninterpretations. This is especially so for interpretations that occur\nshortly after the constitution’s adoption, when worries about binding\nfuture generations is not in play. Original understandings simply\ncannot be dispositive, at least not in perpetuity. In the end, the\nrelative importance of factors like textual meaning, original\nunderstandings, later interpretations, and intended purposes, may be,\nas Joseph Raz suggests (1996, 176–91), fundamentally a question\nof political morality which cannot be answered in the abstract and\nwithout considering what it is that justifies, at that particular\nmoment of interpretation, having an entrenched constitution at all,\nlet alone one with such and such particular content. Sometimes,\nretrieval of an existing concrete understanding will be required,\nespecially when the constitution is in its infancy and was partly\nmeant to settle a range of concrete moral questions as to the proper\nlimits of government power, at least for a while. But if an\ninterpreter has good reason to believe that this settlement function\nhas been overtaken by other more pressing concerns, perhaps the need\nto adapt in light of dramatically changed circumstances or much better\nmoral understanding, then a more innovative interpretation may be\ncalled for. And once again, to say that constitutional interpreters\nmust sometimes be innovative is not to say that a constitution can be\ninterpreted to mean whatever the interpreter wants it to mean. \nAlthough constitutionalism has been widely embraced round the world,\nit is by no means without its detractors. This is especially true when\nwe turn to those constitutions that not only create and regulate the\noffices of government but also purport to protect abstract rights of\npolitical morality. Some critics—we’ll call these the hard\ncritics—assert that such apparently rights-protective\nconstitutions cannot effectively and legitimately serve to protect\nindividuals against the oppressive forces of\n governments.[24]\n On the contrary, they only serve to mask legal and political practice\nin a false cloak of legitimacy. Other critics—we’ll call these\nthe democratic critics—are not so utterly dismissive of\nrights-protecting constitutions. Rather, their main concern is to\nchallenge the role that democratically unaccountable judges typically\nplay in the interpretation and application of such constitutions. \nAccording to hard critics, factors like original understandings and\nthe supposed discipline of common law reasoning seldom, if ever,\nsucceed in fixing meaningful limits upon government power. As a\nresult, reliance on such factors in constitutional adjudication only\nserves: (a) to rationalize the purely political decisions of judges\npursuing, consciously or not, their own political ideologies. Further\nconsequences include: (b) a serious affront to democracy. In most\nconstitutional democracies, the judges who ultimately decide\nconstitutional cases are appointed, not elected. That is, they hold\noffice not because they were selected to do so by the democratic\ncommunity, but because of a decision on the part of a President, a\nPrime Minister, a small group of fellow judges, or a judicial\ncommittee of Parliament. Furthermore, these appointed judges tend to\ncome from the privileged classes of society. The end result is that a small\ngroup of unelected, elitist judges with the power to substitute their\nown, highly contentious views about the proper limits of government\npower for the considered judgments of the people’s representatives,\ne.g., those members of Congress or Parliament duly elected to\nexercise, on behalf of the people, the latter’s sovereign right to\nparticipate in political decisions affecting their basic rights. And\npossibly (c): suppression of those—women, minority racial\ngroups, the poor, and so on—whose interests are not adequately\nrecognized and protected by the dominant, mainstream ideologies to\nwhich these elite judges have an affinity. Instead of the curbing of\nrights-threatening government power for which the idea of\nconstitutionalism is supposed to stand, we have political suppression\ndisguised in a cloak of false constitutional legitimacy. \nSo hard critics are highly skeptical of constitutional practice and of\nthose theories that applaud constitutionalism as a bulwark against\n oppression.[25]\n As noted at the outset of this entry, a key element in the idea of\nconstitutionalism is that government can/should be limited in its\npowers and that its authority depends on observance of those limits.\nIt was further noted that the authority of constitutions in\nconstitutional democracies is generally thought to rest with\n‘the people’. One further implication of hard critical\ntheories is: (d) that the concept of ‘the people’ is very\nmuch a fabrication. Instead of being composed of a group of\nindividuals united in their concern for basic rights, western\nsocieties are comprised of various groups competing either for\ndomination (e.g., white males and the wealthy) or for recognition and\nthe elimination of oppression (e.g., the poor, women, and racial\nminorities). The law, including constitutional law, is a powerful tool\nwhich has, historically, been utilized by dominant groups to secure\nand maintain their superior status. \nA particularly vivid example of this last consequence is arguably\nfound in Lochner v New York, a notorious case in which the\nUnited States Supreme Court ruled that a New York State law requiring\nthat bakery employees work no more than ten hours per day and sixty\nhours per week violated the Fourteenth Amendment, which asserts that\nno State may “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of\n law.”.[26]\n The Fourteenth Amendment, the Court held, entails “the right and\nliberty of the individual to contract” for a longer work week. The\nLochner decision gave rise to what is commonly called “the\nLochner era”, a period stretching roughly from 1905 till 1937\nin which the Supreme Court struck down numerous Federal and State\nstatutes aimed at improving the working conditions of employees. As\nsuch, it may well have been a period during which the United States\nConstitution, in the hands of an elitist Court, served only to\n“legitimize” overt political suppression. According to hard critics,\nthe Lochner era is but one small piece of a much larger\npicture. \nTo sum up, according to hard critics, a constitution is anything but\nthe protection from unwarranted government power that its champions\nhave heralded over the centuries. What is taken to be the obvious\nmeaning of a key term like ‘equal before the law’ is what\nthe dominant group understands or claims it to be. What is taken to be\nthe obvious original understandings or historical intentions of the\nconstitution’s authors are whatever understandings or intentions fit\nthe ideologies of the dominant groups. What is taken to be the best\narticulation of the right to equality emerging from a fair and\ndisciplined common-law analysis of that right, is nothing but a\nrationalization of current social structures, all of which\nsystematically oppress the interests of women, minorities and the\npoor. \nAs noted above, democratic critics tend not to be as utterly\ndismissive of constitutions and constitutional rights protections as\ntheir more hard-line cousins. Their principal objections revolve\naround a practice with which these aspects of modern constitutional\nregimes are typically associated: judicial or constitutional\nreview. This is the practice whereby courts are sometimes called\nupon to review a law or some other official act of government (e.g.,\nthe decision of an administrative agency like the US Food and Drug\nAdministration or the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications\nCommission) to determine its compatibility with the\n constitution.[27]\n Particular instances of this practice vary considerably. In some\njurisdictions, such as the United States, judicial review includes the\npower to ‘strike down’ or nullify a law duly passed by a\nlegislature body or administrative body and the decision is final and\nirreversible. In other jurisdictions, the courts either do not have\nthe power to strike down or nullify, or a decision to do so is\nreversible by some other body of government. For example, courts in\nthe United Kingdom do not have the power to invalidate Parliament’s\nlegislation, that is, declare it void and of no force and effect. But\nthey do have the authority, under section 4 of the Human Rights Act\n1998, officially to declare legislation incompatible with The\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. Upon such a declaration,\nParliament usually undertakes to amend or repeal the offending\nlegislation. But should it chose not to do so, the legislation remains\nvalid and the courts have no further legal recourse. In Canada, the\nSupreme Court has the power to strike down a law which it believes\nunjustifiably infringes a right guaranteed in Sections 2 or 7–15 of\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but Section 33\nof that same Charter grants Parliament or the legislature of\na province the power to override that decision. This co-called\n“notwithstanding clause” allows Parliament or a provincial legislature\nto declare that, notwithstanding its unjustifiable infringement of an\nenumerated right, the offending legislation will stand as\nconstitutionally valid. The more robust form of constitutional review\npracticed in the United States has come to be known as “strong-form\nreview,” while the less robust versions embraced by the United Kingdom\nand Canada are called “weak-form\n review.”[28]\n Insofar as weak-form review leaves the final decision regarding the\nmeaning and scope of a constitutional right and the limits it imposes\non government powers in the hands of the legislature, it is touted by\nits defenders as consistent with democratic principle. According to\nits critics, however, it strips the constitution of one of its most\nvital functions: the protection of individual and minority rights\nagainst what Mill, following de Tocqueville, famously called “the\ntyranny of the majority.”\n [29] \nAmong the most influential of contemporary democratic critics is\nJeremy Waldron. Waldron is, to put it mildly, no fan of constitutional\nreview. Nor is he enamored of the grandiose constitutional charters\nand bills of rights which serve as the most contentious ground in\nterms of which that power is often exercised by courts. According to\nWaldron and his fellow democratic critics, constitutional review under\nan entrenched charter or bill of rights is fraught with both\ntheoretical and practical difficulty. It threatens democracy and is\nboth fundamentally unfair and politically dangerous. It also relies on\noutmoded views about the nature of moral rights—that there are\nobjective, universal rights of political morality to which charters or\nbills of rights make reference, upon which there is widespread\nagreement within democratic communities, and to which judges can\nsensibly and justifiably be asked to appeal in protecting citizens\nagainst recalcitrant exercises of government power. While it is true\nthat constitutional review need not be based on an appeal to abstract\nrights of political morality—it could, for example, be\nrestricted to questions such as whether Congress or a provincial\nlegislature has followed proper procedure—and true that it need\nnot include the ability actually to strike down legislation, the main\nfocus of democratic critics has been on strong-form constitutional\nreview which exemplifies these two features. \nAccording to democratic critics it is difficult to underestimate the\nconsiderable power which constitutional review under an entrenched\ncharter or bill of rights places in the hands of judges who are, in\nmodern constitutional democracies, typically unelected and hence not\ndirectly accountable to the democratic community. Despite their lack\nof accountability, these judges are assigned the task of providing\nauthoritative answers to the deeply controversial questions of\npolitical morality that arise under constitutional review and with respect\nto which there is so much deep disagreement. Examples can range from\nthe permissibility of abortion or physician-assisted suicide, to the\nbanning of hate speech or the publication of violent and degrading\npornography on the intenet. On the basis of these highly controversial\nanswers they end up determining what shall be deemed lawful in the\ncommunity. This is far too much political power for a small group of\nunelected people to wield over an entire democratic community, no\nmatter how learned and wise they might happen to be. But perhaps more\nimportantly, the granting of such power is fundamentally undemocratic\nin principle: individual citizens have, in effect, been\ndisenfranchised by this arrangement. Each citizen of voting age should\nhave an equal right, in a democratic society, to contribute to the\ncreation of the laws by which she is governed. This she exercises\ndirectly via the ballot box and by whatever contributions to public\ndiscourse and debate about controversial issues she chooses to make.\nShe also does so indirectly via the legislative votes of her elected\nrepresentatives, whose task is to represent her interests and\nopinions. Yet with strong-form constitutional review all this has been\nreplaced by subjection to the pronouncements of judges. The duly\nconsidered views of citizens and their representatives about the laws\nby which they are to be governed, arrived at (it is hoped) through\nfair processes of democratic decision-making, have, in effect, been\nset aside in favour of the contentious moral pronouncements of a\nhandful of democratically unaccountable, elite judges. This unhappy\nsituation is further exacerbated by the undeniable fact that judges on\nappeal courts often disagree vehemently among themselves about rights\nof political morality and must often, in the end, rely on majority\nvoting to settle their own disagreements. It is not at all uncommon to\nsee split votes when a court deals with a contentious issue of moral\nprinciple like affirmative action, abortion or pornography. And often\nthese split votes follow patterns which are closely correlated with\nthe all too discernible political leanings of\n judges.[30]\n Add to this the fact that judges render decisions which all too often\nappear to conflict not only with views widely shared in the community\nat large, but also with their own previous decisions in earlier cases,\nand what might seem like a marvelous idea in the\nabstract—constitutionally guaranteeing moral rights and\nfundamental interests against the abuse of government power—is\ntransformed into a living nightmare. A nightmare in which democracy,\nfairness and the rule of law have, in effect, been abandoned and\nreplaced by the rule of a few men and women, by a kind of\n‘judicial oligarchy’. And no matter the high esteem in\nwhich we tend to hold our judges in modern constitutional democracies,\nthis is not a form of government to be eagerly embraced. \nCritical theories, both hard and democratic, represent a serious\nchallenge not only to conventional theories and established practices\nof constitutional interpretation, but to the very idea of\nconstitutionalism itself—the idea that government can and should\nbe limited in ways that serve to protect us from unwarranted state\npower. According to originalism, the constitution protects us from\njudges and other officials by restricting them (largely) to\npolitically and morally uncontroversial, neutral decisions about\nhistorical intentions and understandings. According to one strand of\nliving constitutionalism, our evolving constitution can do the same\nwhile at the same time allowing the constitution to grow and adapt to\nchanging circumstances and (it is hoped) better moral understandings.\nIt can effect this balancing act so long as the judges, in whom the\npower of constitutional interpretation and enforcement has largely\nbeen placed, are willing to subject their deliberations to the\ndiscipline of common law reasoning. Critics, however, remain highly\nskeptical. Ordinary judges are not, critical theorists will insist,\nPlatonic kings and queens, dispensing justice in the light of\nobjective moral truth. We must always remember, critics insist, that\nour judges are ordinary, flawed human beings with all the intellectual\nand moral shortcomings, weaknesses and biases of their fellow human\nbeings. They are also, more often than not, members of a dominant\ngroup (e.g., wealthy, white males) who share the social background,\neducation, perspective, and values of that group. But if constitutions\nare all at the mercy of dominant ideologies and the whims and\nconvictions of elite judges, then the kind of protections heralded by\nthe idea of constitutionalism may be a myth, and a harmful one at\nthat. \nSo what is the solution according to critical theorists? The proffered\nsolutions can vary considerably, depending on how hard-line the\ntheorist tends to be. A theocrat might advocate the complete overthrow\nof constitutional, democratic government, while a liberal feminist\ncritic might be content to work within existing constitutional systems\nto eradicate the vestiges of patriarchy which have survived recent\nfeminist movements (MacKinnon, 1989; Strossen 1995). Waldron and his\nfellow democratic critics ague that we should abandon the practice of\nconstitutional review of legislation under entrenched charters or\nbills of rights and leave political decisions where they belong: the\npeople and their elected and accountable representatives (Waldron,\n1992, 2006; Marmor, 2007). Yet another avenue of response is to\nhighlight the extent to which the critics’ most powerful objections\napply only to strong-form review, where judicial decisions are final\nand can have the effect of nullifying the efforts of democratically\naccounted legislatures. Having pointed this out, the next move is to\nrecommend weaker forms of review which arguably reflect a healthier\nbalance between respect for fundamental rights, on the one hand, and\nthe importance of democratic procedure on the other (Gardbaum, 2013).\nWere an effective version of something like Canada’s Section 33\noverride included within a constitution, the courts might well be able\nmaintain their intended role as defenders of rights, while leaving the\nfinal word to the legislature in cases where intractable differences\nof opinion run\n deep.[31]\n But whatever the preferred solution, all critics of constitutionalism\nseem to agree that progress can be made only if the myths surrounding\nconstitutional protection—the constraining force of original\nunderstanding, intention, history, the discipline of common law, and\nso on— are all exposed, and that the true political forces at\nwork in constitutional practice are acknowledged and dealt with\nopenly. Whether the idea of constitutionalism can survive the lessons\nof such critical scrutiny is a very good\n question.","contact.mail":"walucho@mcmaster.ca","contact.domain":"mcmaster.ca"}]
