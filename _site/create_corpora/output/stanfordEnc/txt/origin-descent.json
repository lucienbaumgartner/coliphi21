The latter has been split into two separate\nentries.]\n\n\n\nThis entry intends to give a broad historical review of the origin and\ndevelopment of Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection\nthrough the initial Darwinian phase of the “Darwinian\nRevolution” up to the publication of the Descent of Man\nin 1871. The development of evolutionary ideas before Darwin’s\nwork has been treated in the separate entry\n evolutionary thought before Darwin.\n Several additional aspects of Darwin’s theory of evolution and\nhis biographical development are dealt with in other entries in this\nencyclopedia (see the entries on\n Darwinism;\n species;\n natural selection;\n creationism). The remainder of this entry will focus on the following\npoints in relation to Darwin’s theory not developed in the other\nentries. It will also maintain a historical and textual approach.\nOther entries in this encyclopedia cited at the end of the article and\nthe bibliography should be consulted for discussions beyond this\npoint. The issues will be examined under the following headings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharles Darwin’s version of transformism has been the subject of\nmassive historical and philosophical scholarship almost unparalleled\nin any other area of the history of science. This includes the\ncontinued flow of monographic studies and collections of articles on\naspects of Darwin’s theory (Richards and Ruse 2016; Ruse 2013a,\n2009a,b, 2008; Ruse & Richards 2008; Hodge & Radick 2003\n[2009]; Hösle & Illies [eds] 2005; Gayon 1998; Bowler 1996;\nDepew & Weber 1995; Kohn 1985a). The continuous production of\npopular and professional biographical studies on Darwin provide ever\nnew insights (Ruse et al.  2013a; Johnson 2012; Desmond & Moore\n1991, 2009; Browne 1995, 2002; Bowlby 1990; Bowler 1990). In addition,\nmajor editing projects on Darwin’s manuscripts and\nCorrespondence, now completed through 1878, continue to reveal details\nand new insights into the issues surrounding Darwin’s own\nthought (Keynes [ed.] 2000; Burkhardt et al. [eds] 1985–; Darwin\n1836–1844 [1987]). The Cambridge Darwin Online website (see Other Internet Resources) serves as an international\nclearinghouse for this worldwide Darwinian scholarship. \nA long tradition of scholarship has interpreted Darwin’s theory\nto have originated from a framework defined by endemic British natural\nhistory, a British tradition of natural theology defined particularly\nby William Paley (1743–1805), the methodological precepts of\nJohn Herschel (1792–1871), and the geological theories of\nCharles Lyell (1797–1875). His conversion to the uniformitarian\ngeology of Charles Lyell and to Lyell’s thesis of gradual change\nover time during the voyage of the HMS Beagle (December\n1831–October 1836) has been seen as fundamental in his formation\n(Norman 2013; Herbert 2005; Hodge 1983a). Complementing this\npredominantly anglophone historiography has been the\nsocial-constructivist analyses emphasizing the origins of\nDarwin’s theories in British Political Economy (Young, 1985:\nchps. 2, 4, 5). Recently, it has been argued that a primary generating\nsource of Darwin’s inquiries was his involvement with the\nBritish anti-slavery movement, a concern reaching back to his\nrevulsion against slavery developed during the Beagle years\n(Desmond & Moore 2009). \nA strain of revisionist historiography, on the other hand, has\nde-emphasized some of the novelty of Darwin’s views; questions\nhave been raised regarding the validity of the standard biographical\npicture of the early Darwin; new emphasis has been placed on\nDarwin’s relations to the German Romantic movement, to British\nand Scottish medical developments, and to his early formation in\nScottish science and philosophy (R.J. Richards 1999, 2002; Desmond\n1989; Manier 1978). Such revisions to a long-standing historiography\nin the understanding of the genesis of Darwinian theory are indebted\nto the wealth of manuscripts and correspondence that have become\navailable since the 1960s and which are now electronically accessible\nat the Darwin Online “Papers and Manuscripts” section (see\nOther Internet Resources). \nThese materials have drawn attention to previously ignored aspects of\nDarwin’s biography. In particular, the importance of his\nEdinburgh period from 1825–27, largely discounted in importance\nby Darwin himself in his late Autobiography, has been seen as\ncritical for his subsequent development (Desmond & Moore 1991;\nHodge 1985). As a young medical student at the University of Edinburgh\n(1825–27), Darwin developed a close relationship with the\ncomparative anatomist Robert Edmond Grant (1793–1874) through\nthe student Plinian Society, and in many respects Grant served as\nDarwin’s first mentor in science in the pre-Beagle\nyears (Desmond & Moore 1991, chp. 1). Through Grant he was exposed\nto the transformist theories of Jean Baptiste Lamarck and the\nCuvier-Geoffroy debate centered on the Paris Muséum\nnationale d’histoire naturelle (see entry on \nevolutionary thought before Darwin,\nSection 4). This Scottish period also developed in Darwin an abiding\ninterest in invertebrate zoology that would later emerge in full in\nhis important work on the barnacles (Stott 2004; Love 2002; Sloan\n1985). \nSimilarly, there has been a new appreciation of the importance of\nDarwin’s work in physiological botany and entomology during his\nstudies in Cambridge from 1827–31 under the guidance of his\nmentor John Stevens Henslow (1795–1861), who exposed him to the\nphysiological botany of Swiss botanist Alphonse De Candolle\n(1806–93). Through Henslow he was also led to the writings of\nJohn Herschel, Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), and Charles\nLyell. Deeper understanding is now possible concerning Darwin’s\nwork in geology at Cambridge with Adam Sedgwick (1795–1873). All\nof this has considerably deepened the understanding of his scientific\nand intellectual preparation for the theoretical work that transpired\nduring the voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle (Sloan 2003b\n[2009]). Some scholars now interpret Darwin’s initial\nreflections on transformism to have developed from lines of thought\nstimulated by Humboldt’s version of German philosophy of nature\nas much as from the traditional sources usually assumed in Lyell,\nHerschel and British natural theology (R.J.  Richards 2005, 2002:\nchp. 14). This scholarly work, while not rejecting the importance of\ntraditional British sources, has revealed the multiplicity of origins\nof Darwin’s reflections that display the interaction of British\ntraditions with Continental developments in life science and\nphilosophy, including those of German origin (R.J.  Richards 2002;\nSloan 2003a, 2007). \nThe continued scholarly interest in the origins of Darwin’s\ntheory reflects not only the concerns of historians of science, but\nalso those who see a continued relevance of Darwin’s own\nwritings as sources of creative reflection for contemporary work in\nevolutionary biology (Gayon 2003). This phenomenon, however, presents\ndifficulties for the historical understanding of Darwinism.\nParticularly within anglophone philosophy of biology, the emphasis on\nthe lines of the development of Darwin’s evolutionary theory\nthat have led to the consensus position achieved in the so-named\n“Synthetic” theory of evolution of the 1930s (Smocovitis\n1996; Mayr & Provine [ed.] 1980; Provine 1971), has tended to\nobscure the complex history of Darwin’s own theoretical\nreflections and the history of Darwinian theory since 1859 (Depew\n& Weber 1995; Bowler 1983). \nThese internal complexities in the heritage of Darwin’s works\nhave shaped Darwinism into more than one tradition, with pre-existing\nsocial and intellectual contexts playing a critical role in the\ninterpretation of Darwin’s achievement. French biology, for\nexample, still pays greater respect to Lamarck than is true in\nanglophone literature (Laurent [ed.] 1997). Several commentators\ncurrently seek to de-emphasize the contrasts between the presumably\nfailed theories of Lamarck and those of Darwin that figure largely in\nBritish and American literature, or else see some greater\ncompatibility between a “molecularized” understanding of\nevolution and Lamarckianism (Gissis & Jablonka [eds] 2011). The\nlong heritage of Kantianism and German Idealism has influenced lines\nof the German interpretations of Darwin up to the present (Hösle\n& Illies [eds] 2005). The general importance of prior social and\nintellectual context in the reception of Darwin’s work is a\ntopic of active research that will be summarized in greater detail\nbelow. \nIn its historical origins, Darwin’s theory was different in kind\nfrom its main predecessors in important ways (Ruse 2013b; see also the\nentry on \n evolutionary thought before Darwin).\n Viewed against a longer historical scenario,\nDarwin’s theory does not deal with cosmology or the origins of\nthe world and life through naturalistic means, and therefore was more\nrestricted in its theoretical scope than its main predecessors\ninfluenced by the reflections of Buffon, Herder, and German\nNaturphilosophen. It also differed from the historical\ndevelopmentalism of his German contemporary, the paleontologist\nHeinrich G. Bronn (Gliboff 2008, 2007). This restriction also\ndistinguished Darwin’s work more immediately from the grand\nevolutionary cosmology put forth anonymously in 1844 by the Scottish\npublisher Robert Chambers (1802–71) in his immensely popular\nVestiges of the Natural History of Creation, a work which in\nmany respects prepared Victorian society in England, and pre-Civil War\nAmerica for general evolutionary theories (Secord 2000; MacPherson\n2015). It also distinguished it from the theories of his contemporary\nHerbert Spencer (1820–1903) summarized below. \nDarwin’s theory first took written form in reflections in a\nseries of notebooks begun during the latter part of the\nBeagle voyage and continued after the return of the\nBeagle in October of 1836. His reflections on the possibility\nof species change are first entered in March of 1837 (“Red\nNotebook”) and are developed in the other notebooks (B–E)\nthrough July of 1839 (Darwin 1836–1844 [1987]; Hodge 2013a,\n2003). Beginning with the reflections of the third or “D”\nNotebook, composed between July and October of 1838, Darwin first\nworked out the rudiments of what was to become his theory of natural\nselection. In the parallel “M” and “N”\nNotebooks, dating between July of 1838 and July of 1839, and in a\nloose collection called “Old and Useless Notes”, dating\nfrom approximately 1838–40, he also developed many of his main\nideas on human evolution that would only be made public in the\nDescent of Man of 1871 (see below).  To summarize a complex issue, these Notebook reflections show\nDarwin proceeding through a series of stages in which he first\nformulated a general theory of the transformation of species from\ncommon ancestry.  He then attempted to work out a causal theory of\nlife that would explain the tendency of life to complexify and\ndiversify (Hodge 2013a, 2003, 1985; Sloan 1986). This causal inquiry\ninto the underlying nature of life , and the explanation of\nlife’s innate tendency to develop and complexify, was then\nreplaced by a shift in focus away from inner tendencies of life. It\nwas replaced by a concern with external forces controlling population,\nwhich was, following Thomas Malthus’s (1766–1834), assumed\nto expand geometrically.  This shift allowed him to develop the\nimplications of population increase for the transformation of\nspecies. \nBy universalizing the Malthusian “principle of\npopulation”, Darwin introduced an “inertial”\nprinciple into his theory, although such language is never used in his\ntext. Newton’s first law, for example, established his physical\nsystem upon the tendency of a body in motion to persist either at rest\nor in uniform motion in a straight line, requiring a causal\nexplanation for any deviations from this initial state. But Newton did\nnot seek a deeper metaphysical explanation for this tendency.\nSimilarly, the principle of population supplied Darwin with the\nassumption of an initial dynamic state of affairs that was not itself\nexplained within the theory—there is no attempt to account\ncausally for this tendency of living beings universally to reproduce\ngeometrically. The principle of population might therefore be regarded\nas functioning axiomatically, defining a set of initial conditions\nfrom which any deviance from this ideal state demands explanation.\nThis theoretical shift enabled Darwin to bracket his earlier efforts\nto develop a causal theory of life, and focus instead on the means by\nwhich the dynamic force of population was controlled. This allowed him\nto emphasize how this control on population worked in company with the\nphenomenon of slight individual variation and changing conditions of\nlife to produce a gradual change of form and function. Darwin would\nlater claim that he was able empirically to support the claim that\nliving populations do tend to increase in this way, but he does not\noffer a causal theory of life to explain this tendency\n(Origin 1859: chp. 3, 63–68). \nThe primary distinguishing feature of Darwin’s theory that separates it\nfrom previous explanations of species change centers on the causal\nexplanation he offered for how this process occurred. Prior theories,\nsuch as that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, relied on the inherent dynamic\nproperties of matter, or in some of the German reflections, on special\ndynamic forces, such as those building upon the “Formative\nDrive” (Bildungstrieb) theory of Johann Blumenbach\n(1752–1840) (Zammito 2018: chps. 7–9). The change of\nspecies was not, in these pre-Darwinian efforts, explained through an\nadaptive process. Darwin’s emphasis after Notebook D on the\nfactors controlling population increase, rather than on a dynamic\ntheory of life grounded in vital forces, however, accounts for many of\nthe differences between Darwin’s theory and those of his\npredecessors and contemporaries. \nThese differences can be summarized in the concept of natural\nselection as a central ingredient of Darwinian theory. However, the\nexact meaning of this concept, and the varying ways he stated the\nprinciple in the Origin over its six editions\n(1859–1872), has given rise to multiple interpretations of the\nmeaning of this principle in the history of Darwinism. \nOne way to see the complexity of Darwin’s own thinking on these\nissues is to follow the textual development of this concept between\nthe close of the Notebook period (1839) and the publication of the\nOrigin of Species in 1859. This period of approximately\ntwenty years involved Darwin in a series of reflections that form\nsuccessive strata in the final version of his theory of the evolution\nof species. Understanding the historical sequence of these\ndevelopments also has significance for subsequent controversies over\nthis concept and the different readings of the Origin as it\nwent through successive editions, and as it was received in other\ncultural contexts (see below,\n Section 3).\n It also has some bearing on assessing Darwin’s relevance for\nmore general philosophical questions, such as those surrounding the\nteleology of nature. \nThe earliest set of themes in the manuscript elaboration of natural\nselection theory can be characterized as those developed through a\nstrong analogy between human art and the workings of nature\n(Theunissen 2013). As this was expressed in the first coherent draft\nof the theory, a 39-page manuscript written in 1842, this discussion\ntransferred the concept of selection of forms by human agency in the\ncreation of the varieties of domestic animals and plants, to the\nactive selection in the natural world by an almost conscious agency, a\n“being more sagacious than man (not an omniscient\ncreator)” (Darwin 1842 [1909: 6] [1996: 91]). This agency\nselects out those features most beneficial to organisms in relation to\nconditions of life, analogous in its action to the selection by man on\ndomestic forms in the production of different breeds. Interwoven with\nthese references to an almost Platonic demiurge are appeals to the\nselecting  power of an active “Nature”: \nNature’s variation far less, but such selection far more rigid\nand scrutinizing[.…] Nature lets [an] animal live, till on\nactual proof it is found less able to do the required work to serve\nthe desired end, man judges solely by his eye, and knows not whether\nnerves, muscles, arteries, are developed in proportion to the change\nof external form. (1842 [1909: 9] [1996: 93]) \nThese themes were continued in the 230 page draft of his theory of\n1844. Again he referred to the selective action of a wise imaginary\nbeing whose selection was made with greater foresight and wisdom than\nhuman selection. This agency worked as a secondary cause in a larger\nplan of a superintending creator, allowing that  \nthe process of selection could go on adapting, nicely and wonderfully,\norganisms, if in ever so small a degree plastic, to diverse ends. I\nbelieve such secondary means do exist. (Darwin 1844a [1909: 87] [1996:\n103]) \nDarwin returned to these issues in 1856, following a twelve-year\nperiod in which he published his Geological Observations on the\nVolcanic Islands (1844b), the second edition of his Journal\nof Researches (1845), Geological Observations on South\nAmerica (1846), the four volumes on fossil and living barnacles\n(1851, 54, 55), and Geological Observations on Coral Reefs\n(1851). In addition, he had published several smaller papers on\ninvertebrate zoology, on geology, and had reported on his experiments\non the resistance of seeds to salt water, a topic that would be of\nimportance in his explanation of the population of remote islands. \nThese intervening inquiries, conducted between 1844 and 1856,\npositioned Darwin to deal with the question of species permanence\nagainst an extensive empirical background. The initial major synthesis\nof these investigations takes place in his long manuscript, or\n“Big Species Book”, commenced in 1856, known in current\nscholarship as the “Natural Selection” manuscript. This\nformed the immediate background text behind the published\nOrigin. Although incomplete, “Natural Selection”\nprovides insights into many critical issues in Darwin’s\nthinking. It was also prepared with an eye to the scholarly community.\nThis distinguishes its form of argument from that of the subsequent\n“abstract” which became the published Origin of\nSpecies. “Natural Selection” contained tables of\ndata, references to scholarly literature, and other apparatus expected\nof a non-popular work, none of which survived in the published\nOrigin. \nThe “Natural Selection” manuscript also contained some new\ntheoretical developments of relevance to the concept of natural\nselection that are not found in earlier manuscripts. Scholars have\nnoted the introduction in this manuscript of the “principle of\ndivergence”, the thesis that organisms under the action of\nnatural selection will tend to radiate and diversify within their\n“conditions of life”—the contemporary name for the\ncomplex of environmental and species-interaction relationships (Kohn\n1985b, 2008). Although the concept of group divergence under the\naction of natural selection might be seen as an implication of\nDarwin’s theory from his earliest formulations of the 1830s,\nnonetheless Darwin’s explicit definition of this as a\n“principle”, and its discussion in a long later insertion in the\n“Natural Selection” manuscript, suggests its importance\nfor Darwin’s mature theory. The principle of divergence was now\nseen by Darwin to form an important link between natural variation and\nthe conditions of existence under the action of the driving force of\npopulation increase. \nStill evident in the “Natural Selection” manuscript is\nDarwin’s implicit appeal to some kind of teleological ordering\nof the process. The action of the “wise being” of the\nearlier manuscripts, however, has now been given over entirely to the\naction of a selective “Nature”, now referred to in the\ntraditional feminine gender. This Nature, \n…cares not for mere external appearance; she may be said to\nscrutinise with a severe eye, every nerve, vessel & muscle; every\nhabit, instinct, shade of constitution,—the whole machinery of\nthe organisation. There will be here no caprice, no favouring: the\ngood will be preserved & the bad rigidly destroyed.… Can we\nwonder then, that nature’s productions bear the stamp of a far\nhigher perfection than man’s product by artificial selection.\nWith nature the most gradual, steady, unerring, deep-sighted\nselection,—perfect adaption [sic] to the conditions of\nexistence.… (Natural Selection 1856 [1974:\n224–225]) \nThe language of this passage, directly underlying statements about the\naction of “natural selection” in the first edition of the\npublished Origin, indicates the complexity in the exegesis of\nDarwin’s meaning of “natural selection” when viewed\nin light of its historical genesis (Ospovat 1981). The parallels\nbetween art and nature, the intentionality implied in the term\n“selection”, the notion of “perfect”\nadaptation, and the substantive conception of “nature” as\nan agency working toward certain ends, all render Darwin’s views\non teleological purpose more complex than they are typically\ninterpreted from the standpoint of contemporary Neo-selectionist\ntheory (Lennox 1993, 2013). As will be discussed below, the changes\nDarwin subsequently made in his formulations of this concept over the\nhistory of the Origin lead to different conceptions of what\nhe meant by this principle and underlie most contemporary meanings of\nnatural selection. \nThe hurried preparation and publication of the Origin between\nthe summer of 1858 and November of 1859 was prompted by the receipt on\nJune 18 of 1858 of a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace that outlined\nhis remarkably similar views on the possibility of continuous species\nchange under the action of a selection upon natural variation. This\nevent had important implications for the subsequent form of\nDarwin’s published argument. Rapidly condensing the detailed\narguments of the “Natural Selection” manuscript into\nshorter chapters, Darwin also universalized several claims that he had\nonly developed with reference to specific groups of organisms, or\nwhich he had applied only to more limited situations in the\nmanuscript. This resulted in a presentation of his theory at the level\nof broad generalization. The absence of tables of data, detailed\nfootnotes, and references to the secondary literature in the published\nversion also resulted in predictable criticisms which will be\ndiscussed below in\n Section 3. \nThe structure of the argument of the Origin has been the\ntopic of considerable literature and can only be summarized here\n (Darwinism,\n this encyclopedia; Hodge 2013b; Hoquet 2013; Waters 2003; Depew 2008; Ruse 2008;\nLennox 2005). Darwin himself described his book as “one long\nargument”. The exact nature of this argument is, however, not\nimmediately transparent, and alternative interpretations have been\nmade of his reasoning and rhetorical strategies in formulating his\nevolutionary theory. \nThe scholarly reconstruction of Darwin’s methodology employed in\nthe Origin has taken two primary forms. One approach has been\nto reconstruct it from the standpoint of currently accepted models of\nscientific explanation, sometimes presenting it as a formal deductive\nmodel (Sober 1984). Another, more historical, approach interprets his\nmethodology in the context of accepted canons of scientific\nexplanation found in Victorian discussions of the period (Ruse 2013b;\nWaters 2003; Hull 2003; Lewens 2008; Ruse 2008; Lennox 2005; Hodge\n1983b). The degree to which Darwin did in fact draw from the available\nmethodological discussions of his contemporaries—John Herschel,\nWilliam Whewell, John Stuart Mill—is not fully clear from\navailable documentary sources. The claim most readily documented, and\ndefended particularly by M. J. S. Hodge (1977, 1983a), has emphasized\nthe importance of John Herschel’s A Preliminary Discourse on\nthe Study of Natural Philosophy (1830), which Darwin read as a\nyoung student at Cambridge prior to his departure on the HMS\nBeagle in December of 1831. In Herschel’s writings he would\nhave encountered the claim that science seeks to determine “true\ncauses”—verae causae. This concept Newton had\nspecified in the Principia as the third of his “Rules\nof Reasoning in Philosophy” (see the entry on\n Newton’s philosophy, \n  Section 4). This was\nto be the goal of scientific explanation. Such causes, in\nHerschel’s formulation, were those necessary to produce the\ngiven effects; they were truly active in producing the effects; and\nthey adequately explained these effects (Herschel 1830; Lennox 2005;\nWaters 2003). These criteria distinguished a satisfactory scientific\naccount from the simple “saving of phenomena” by plausible\nexplanations in the tradition of scientific conventionalism. The\nimpact of Herschel’s arguments on Darwin’s intellectual\ndevelopment was evidently profound, although there is no direct\ntextual reference to Herschel’s concept of a vera causa\nitself in the Notebooks and other early writings. \nThe other plausible methodological source for Darwin’s mature\nreasoning was the work of his older contemporary and former Cambridge\nmentor, the Rev. William Whewell (1794–1866), whose three-volume\nHistory of the Inductive Sciences (1837) Darwin read with\ncare after his return from his round-the-world voyage. Again, the\nimpact of Whewell’s explicit theory of scientific method, as set\nforth in his Philosophy of Inductive Science (first ed. 1840)\nin the pre-Origin period is difficult to document, with no\ndirect evidence of the reading of Whewell’s Philosophy\nin the Darwin reading Notebooks or Correspondence from his\nformative years before the publication of the Origin. \nNevertheless, a plausible argument has been made that the actual\nstructure of Darwin’s text is more closely similar to a\n“Whewellian” rather than to a “Herschelian”\nmodel of argument (Ruse 1975, 2013c). In Whewell’s 1840 account, the emphasis of\nscientific inquiry is, as Herschel had also argued, to be placed on\nthe discovery of “true causes”. But evidence for the\ndetermination of a vera causa was to be demonstrated by the\nability of disparate phenomena to be drawn together under a single\nunifying “Conception of the Mind”, exemplified for Whewell\nby Newton’s universal law of gravitation. This\n“Consilience of Inductions”, as Whewell termed this\nprocess of theoretical unification under a few simple concepts, was\nachieved only by true scientific theories employing true causes\n(Whewell 1840: xxxix). In a restatement of this principle in a revised\nedition of his Philosophy of Inductive Science published only\na year before the Origin, Whewell argued that  \nthe cases in which inductions from classes of facts altogether\ndifferent have thus jumped together, belong only to the best\nestablished theories which the history of science contains. (Whewell\n1858: 88)  \nIt has therefore been argued that Darwin’s theory fundamentally\nproduces this kind of consilience argument, and that his methodology is more properly aligned with that of Whewell. \nIn rhetorical structure, the Origin more evidently develops\nwhat can be termed a “constructive” argument, with a\ncomplex style of presentation indebted to what has been called\n“situated argumentation”, similar to the views developed\nby contemporary Oxford logician and rhetorical theorist Richard\nWhately (1787–1863) (Depew 2008). It proceeds by drawing the\nreader into Darwin’s world by personal narration as it presents\na series of limited issues for acceptance in the first three chapters,\nnone of which required of the reader a considerable leap of\ntheoretical assent, and most of which, such as natural variation and\nMalthusian population increase, had already been recognized in some\nform in the literature of the period. \nThese ingredients are then assembled together in chapter four into a\nremarkable synthesis that rapidly extends the claims by generalization\nto cover the full range of life, both in time and in space. With\nDarwin’s carefully-designed rhetorical strategy of presentation,\nonly by chapter four would the reader know the full character and\nbroad implications of the claims being developed in the early\nchapters. By the end of that chapter, the reader would be presented\nwith a remarkably comprehensive theory of the relations of living\nforms, and the mode of their origin, both in the present and in the\npast history of the planet. \nOpening with a pair of chapters that draw upon the art-nature analogy\ndeveloped in the manuscripts, Darwin framed the argument with an\naccount of the probable origin of domestic animals, and by inference,\nof domesticated plants (Theunissen 2013). These forms are presumed to\nhave arisen through the action of human selection on the slight\nvariations existing between individuals within the same species. A\npossible interpretation of this process as implying directional, and\neven intentional, selection, was at the same time downplayed in the\npublished work through the importance given by Darwin to the role of\n“unconscious” selection, a concept not encountered in the\nNatural Selection manuscript. This denotes the selection practiced\neven by aboriginal peoples who simply seek to maintain the integrity\nof a breed by preserving the best forms. The domestic breeding analogy\nis, however, more than a decorative rhetorical strategy. It repeatedly\nfunctions for Darwin as the principal empirical example to which he\ncould appeal at several places in the text as a means of visualizing\nthe working of natural selection in nature, and this appeal remains\nintact through the six editions of the Origin. \nFrom this model of human selection working on small natural variations\nto produce the domestic forms, Darwin then developed in the second\nchapter the implications of “natural” variation, delaying\ndiscussion of the concept of natural selection until chapter four. The\nfocus of the second chapter introduces another important issue. Here\nhe extends the discussion of variation developed in chapter one into\nan attack on the traditional “Linnaean” understanding of\nclassification as a sorting out of species by means of essential\ndefining properties. It is in this chapter that Darwin most explicitly\ndevelops his own position on the nature of organic species in relation\nto his theory of descent. It is also here that he sets forth the\ningredients for his attack on species “essentialism”. \nDarwin’s analysis of the “species question” is a\ncomplex issue that has many implications for how his work was read by\nhis contemporaries and successors. This still forms a topic of\nextensive discussion in the literature (see\n species\n and\n Darwinism,\n this encyclopedia; Mallet 2013; Hodge 2013b; R.A. Richards 2010; Wilkins 2009;\nStamos 2007; Sloan 2008, 2013). His sometimes contradictory statements\non this issue—alternating between overt denials of the reality\nof species in some places, and clear affirmation of the reality of\nspecies in others—have been seen by some scholars as an\nintentional rhetorical strategy (Stamos 2007; Beatty 1985). \nPrior tradition had been heavily affected by Buffon’s\nnovel conception of biological species in which he made a sharp\ndistinction between “natural” species defined by such\nproperties as fertile interbreeding, and “artificial”\nspecies and varieties defined by morphological traits and measurements\nupon these (see the entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin,\n Section 3.3). This distinction was utilized selectively by Darwin. Particularly as\nconceptualized by German natural historians of the early\nnineteenth-century, “Buffonian” species were defined by\nthe unity of common descent, and distinguished by their historical and\nontological character from the taxonomic species of Linnaean natural\nhistory. This distinction between “natural” and\n“logical” species had maintained a distinction between\nproblems of practical classification of preserved specimens, and those\nrelating to the unity of natural species, which most maintained as\nfixed on the basis of reproductive unity and the sterility criterion\n(Sloan 2008). \nRemarkable in Darwin’s argument, however, is the way in which he\ndraws selectively from these preexistent traditions to undermine the\nspecies “realism” assumed within these. One\ntradition—what can be considered in his immediate context the\nLinnaean tradition—regarded species in the sense of universals\nof logic or class concepts, whose “reality” rested in many\ncases on divine creation. The alternative “Buffonian”\ntradition viewed species in the sense of material lineages of descent\nwhose fixity was determined by some kind of immanent principle, such\nas an “internal mold” or specifying vital force (see\n evolutionary thought before Darwin\n 3.3). The result in Darwin’s hands is a complex interweaving of\nconcepts of varieties, races, sub-species, tribes, and natural\nfamilies that can be shown to represent different traditions of\ndiscussion in the literature of the period. This creative conflation\nalso led to many confusions about how Darwin actually did conceive of\nspecies and species change in time (Sloan 2008). \nDarwin addresses the species question by raising the problems caused\nby natural variation in the practical discrimination of taxa at the\nspecies and varietal levels. Although the difficulty of taxonomic\ndistinctions at this level was a well-recognized problem in the\nliterature of the time, he subtly transforms this practical\nproblem into a metaphysical ambiguity—the fuzziness of\nformal taxonomic distinctions is seen to imply a similar ambiguity of\n“natural” species boundaries. \nFor example, natural variation is employed by Darwin in chapter two of\nthe Origin to break down the distinction between species and\nvarieties as these concepts were commonly employed in the practical\ntaxonomic literature. The arbitrariness apparent in making\ndistinctions, particularly in plants and invertebrates, meant that\nsuch species were only what “naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience” defined them to\nbe (Origin 1859: 47). These arguments form the basis for\nclaims by his contemporaries that Darwin was a species\n“nominalist”, who defined species only as conventional and\nconvenient divisions of a continuum of individuals. \nBut this feature of Darwin’s discussion of species only in part\ncaptures the complexity of his argument. Drawing also on the tradition\nof species realism developed within the Buffonian tradition, Darwin\nalso affirmed that species and varieties are defined by common descent\nand material relations of interbreeding. Darwin then employed the\nambiguity of the distinction between species and varieties created by\ntaxonomic variation in practical taxonomy to undermine the ontological\nfixity of “natural” species. Varieties are not simply the\nformal taxonomic subdivisions of a natural species as conceived in the\nLinnaean tradition. They are, as he terms them,\n“incipient” species (Origin 1859: 52). This\nsubtly transformed the issue of local variation and adaptation to\ncircumstances into a primary ingredient for historical evolutionary\nchange. The conclusions to be drawn from this argument were, however,\nonly to be revealed in chapter four of the text. \nBefore assembling the ingredients of these first two chapters, Darwin\nthen introduced in chapter three the concept of a “struggle for\nexistence”. This concept is introduced in a “large and\nmetaphorical sense” that included different levels of organic\ninteractions, from direct struggle for food and space to the struggle\nfor life of a plant in a desert. Although described as an application\nof Thomas Malthus’s parameter of geometrical increase of\npopulation in relation to the arithmetical increase of food supply,\nDarwin’s use of this concept in fact reinterprets\nMalthus’s principle, which was formulated only with reference to\nhuman population in relation to food supply. It now becomes a general\nprinciple governing all of organic life. Thus the organisms comprising\nfood itself would also be included. Through this universalization, the\ncontrols on population becomes only in the extreme case grounded\ndirectly on the traditional Malthusian limitations of food and space.\nNormal controls are instead exerted through a complex network of\nrelationships of species acting one on another in predator-prey,\nparasite-host, and food-web relations. This profound revision of\nMalthus’s arguments rendered Darwin’s theory deeply\n“ecological” as this term would later be employed. The abundance of red clover in England Darwin sees as dependent on the numbers of  pollinating humble bees  which are controlled by mice, and these are controlled by the number of cats, making cats the determinants of clover abundance. The\nabundance of Scotch Firs is limited by the number of cattle, to cite\ntwo examples employed by Darwin (Origin 1859: 72–74).\nThis recognition of complex species-species interactions as the\nprimary means of population control also prevents one from reading the\nOrigin as a simple extension of British political economy and\nthe competition embedded in Victorian industrialization to the natural\nworld. \nWith the ingredients of the first three chapters in place, Darwin was\npositioned to assemble these together in his culminating fourth\nchapter on natural selection. In this long discussion, Darwin develops\nthe main exposition of his central theoretical concept. For his\ncontemporaries and for the subsequent tradition, however,\nDarwin’s concept of “natural” selection was not\nunambiguously clear for reasons we have outlined above, and these\nunclarities were to be the source of several persistent lines of\ndisagreement and controversy. It is not clear, for example, whether\nDarwin conceives of natural selection as an efficient or as a\nfinal cause; whether it is an emergent result of\nother causes; or if it is a simple description of the working\ntogether of several independent causal factors without its own causal\nstatus. Judging from the text of the Origin itself, it is\ndifficult to verify the claim that natural selection was itself\nconsidered by Darwin to be a vera causa in Herschel’s\nsense. The importance of the vera causa principle for\nDarwin’s argument has been claimed by several scholars (Hodge\n2013b; Waters 2003 [2009:\n124–27]). But from textual evidence, Darwin  reserved this designation in the\nOrigin for “community of descent”, for the causes\nof “ordinary generation”, or even for the mistaken beliefs\nof “special creationists” (Origin 1859: 159, 352,\n482; Depew 2008: 243). \nIn the initial definition of natural selection presented in the first\nedition of Darwin’s text, it is characterized as\n“preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of\ninjurious variations” (Origin 1859: 81). When Darwin\nelaborated on this concept in chapter four of the first edition, he\ncontinued to describe natural selection in language suggesting that it\ninvolved intentional selection, continuing the strong art-nature\nparallel found in the manuscripts. For example: \nAs man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature\neffect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature\ncares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful\nto any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of\nconstitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects\nonly for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she\ntends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the\nbeing is placed under well-suited conditions of life. (Origin\n1859: 83) \nThe manuscript history behind such passages prevents the simple\ndiscounting of these statements as mere rhetorical imagery. As we have\nseen, the parallel between intentional human selectivity and that of\n“nature” formed the original model upon which the concept\nof natural selection was originally constructed. \nCriticisms that quickly developed over the overt intentionality\nembedded in such passages, however, led Darwin to revise the argument\nin editions beginning with the third edition of 1861. From this point\nonward he explicitly downplayed the intentional and teleological\nlanguage of the first two editions, denying that his appeals to the\nselective role of “nature” were anything more than a\nliterary figure, and he moved decisively in the direction of defining\nnatural selection as the description of the action of natural laws\nworking upon organisms rather than as an efficient or final cause of\nlife. He also regrets in his Correspondence his mistake in\nnot utilizing the designation “natural preservation”\nrather than “natural selection” to characterize his\nprinciple (letter to Lyell 28 September 1860,  Burkhardt et al. 1993 8:\n397; also see\n Darwin Correspondence Project in Other Internet Resources).\n The adoption in the fifth edition of 1869 of contemporary Herbert\nSpencer’s designator, “survival of the fittest”\n(Spencer 1864: 444–445; Origin 1869: 72), as a synonym\nfor “natural selection”, further emphasized this shift of\nmeaning away from the concept that can be extracted from the early\ntexts and drafts. Thus the formulations of the principle in the final\nstatements of the late 1860s and early 70s underlie the tradition of\nlater “mechanistic” and non-teleological understandings of\nnatural selection, a reading developed by his disciples who, in the\nwords of David Depew, “had little use for either his natural\ntheodicy or his image of a benignly scrutinizing selection”\n(Depew 2008: 253). \nThe conceptual synthesis of chapter four also introduced discussions\nof such matters as the conditions under which natural selection most\noptimally worked, the role of isolation, the causes of the extinction\nof species, and the principle of divergence. Many of these points were\nmade through the imaginative use of “thought experiments”\nin which Darwin constructed possible scenarios through which natural\nselection could bring about substantial change. Although these were\nnot regarded by his critics as empirical evidence for his claims, it\nhas been argued that these assisted Darwin in satisfying certain\ncriteria of adequacy as set forth by John Herschel’s\nmethodological canons (Lennox 2005). One prominent way Darwin captured the complexity of this process is reflected in the single diagram to appear in all the\neditions of the Origin (Velasco 2013). In this illustration\nwas summarized the image of gradual change from common ancestral\npoints, the depiction of the frequent extinction of most lineages, the\ngeneral tendency of populations to diverge and fragment under the\npressure of population increase, and a way of envisioning relations of\ntaxonomic affinity to time. It also depicted the persistence of some\nforms that are unchanged over long geological periods in which stable\nconditions prevail. \nFigure: Tree of life diagram from\nOrigin of Species (Origin 1859: between pages 116\nand 117). \nRemarkable about Darwin’s diagram of the tree of life is the\nrelativity of its coordinates. It is first presented as applying only\nto the divergences taking place at the varietal level, with varieties\nrepresented by the small lower-case letters within species A–L\nof a “wide ranging genus”, with the horizontal time\ncoordinates measured in terms of a limited number of generations.\nHowever, the attentive reader could quickly see that Darwin’s\ndestructive analysis of the distinction between “natural”\nand “artificial” species and the relativity of the\nspecies-variety distinction, worked out in chapter two, allowed this\ndiagram to represent eventually all organic relationships, from those\nat the non-controversial level of diverging varieties within fixed\nspecies, to those of the relations of species within different genera.\nLetters A–L could also represent taxa at the level of Genera,\nFamilies or Orders. The diagram can thus be applied to relationships\nbetween all levels of the Linnaean hierarchy with the vertical\ncoordinates representing potentially vast expanses of time, and the\nhorizontal coordinates the degree of taxonomic divergence over time.\nIn a very few pages of argument, the diagram was generalized to\nrepresent the most extensive group relations, encompassing the whole\nof geological time. Extension of the dotted lines at the bottom could\neven suggest, as Darwin argues in the last paragraph of the book, that\nall life was a result of “several powers, having been originally\nbreathed into a few forms or into one” (Origin 1859:\n490). This could suggest a naturalistic origin of original forms\neither by material emergence, or through the action of a vitalistic\npower of life. It could also be read as implying the action of a\nsupernatural cause. \nIn response to criticisms of his unclarity on this latter point,\nDarwin quickly added to the final paragraph in the second edition of\n1860 the phrase “by the Creator” (1860: 484), which\nremained in all subsequent editions. Coupled with the quotations on\nthe frontispiece that remained in all editions of the work, this could\nimply for some readers Darwin’s intent to locate work within the\ntradition of British natural theology and the long tradition running\nback to the Scholastics that conceptualized creation by secondary law.\nConceptual space was thereby created for a reading of the\nOrigin by some contemporaries, notably by the Harvard\nbotanist Asa Gray (1810–88), as compatible with traditional\nnatural theology (Gray 1860; Lennox 2013). \nThe sweep of the theoretical generalization that closed the natural\nselection chapter, one restated even more generally in the final\nparagraph of the book, required Darwin to deal with several obvious\nobjections to the theory that would occupy him through the numerous\nrevisions of the text between 1859 and 1872. As suggested by David\nDepew, the rhetorical structure of the original text developed in an\nalmost “objections and response” structure that resulted\nin a constant stream of revisions to various editions of the original\ntext as Darwin engaged his opponents (Depew 2008; Peckham 1959\n[2006]). Anticipating at first publication several obvious lines of\nobjection, Darwin devoted much of the text of the original\nOrigin to offering a solution in advance to predictable\ndifficulties. As Darwin outlined these main lines of objection, they\nincluded first the apparent absence of numerous slight gradations\nbetween species, both in the present and in the fossil record, of the\nkind that would seem to be predictable from the gradualist workings of\nthe theory (chps. 6, 9). Second, the existence of organs and\nstructures of extreme complexity, such as the vertebrate eye,\nstructures that had since the writings of Galen in Hellenistic\nantiquity served as a mainstay of the argument for external\nteleological design, needed some plausible explanation (chp. 6).\nThird, the evolution of the elaborate instincts of animals and the\npuzzling problem of the evolution of social insects that developed\nsterile neuter castes, proved to be a particularly difficult issue for\nDarwin in the manuscript phase of his work and needed some account\n(chp. 7). As a fourth major issue needing attention, the traditional\ndistinction between natural species defined by interfertility, and\nartificial species defined by morphological differences, first dealt\nwith in Chapter Two, required an additional chapter of analysis in\nwhich he sought to undermine the absolute character of the\ninterbreeding criterion as a sign of fixed natural species (chp.\n8). \nAs a fifth topic, in chapter ten, Darwin developed his position on the\nfossil record. At issue was whether the known fossil record displays a\ngradual progression of forms from simple to complex, as might be\nargued by Lamarckian transformists, or whether it supported the claim\nfor the persistence of major groups throughout the record as might be\nheld by someone endorsing the tradition of Cuvier (see the entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin,\n Section 4.1). The thesis of geological progressionism had in fact\nbeen denied by none other than Darwin’s great mentor in geology,\nCharles Lyell in his Principles of Geology (1830–33;\nDesmond 1984; Bowler 1976). Darwin defended the progressionist view in\nthis chapter. \nTo each of the lines of objection to his theory, Darwin offered his\ncontemporaries plausible, if not for many critics compelling, replies\n(Hull 1973). Additional arguments were worked out through the\ninsertion of numerous textual insertions over the five revisions of\nthe Origin between 1860 and 1872, including the addition of a\nnew chapter to the sixth edition dealing with\n“miscellaneous” objections. For reasons related both to\nthe condensed and summary form of public presentation, and also as a\nreflection of the bold conceptual sweep of the theory, the primary\nargument of the Origin could not gain its force from the data\npresented by the book itself. Instead, it presented an argument from\nunifying simplicity, gaining its force from the ability of\nDarwin’s theory to draw together a wide variety of issues in\ntaxonomy, comparative anatomy, paleontology, biogeography, and\nembryology under the simple principles worked out in the first four\nchapters (chps. 11–13). In important respects, this\n“consilience” argument might be seen as best reflecting\nthe impact of William Whewell’s methodology (see above),\nalthough Whewell is not cited in any of the editions. \nThe explanatory methodology of Darwin’s theory also provided him\nwith a means of defeating certain major objections, such as those\ndrawn from the existence of organs of great complication and function.\nTo deal with the question of the vertebrate eye in chapter six, for\nexample, Darwin offered a few speculations on how such a structure\ncould have developed by the gradual selection upon the rudimentary\neyes of invertebrates. But the primary solution offered was the\nability of his theory to draw together in its total argument numerous\nlines of inquiry that would not otherwise receive a coherent\nexplanation. In such a case one would  \nadmit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be\nformed by natural selection, although in this case he does not know\nany of the transitional grades. (Origin 1859: 188)  \nHere again, one might see Whewell’s notion of a\n“consilience of inductions” at work. \nAs Darwin envisioned it, with the acceptance of his theory, “a\ngrand untrodden field of inquiry will be opened”\n(Origin 1859: 486) in biology and natural history. The\nlong-standing issues of species origins, if not the ultimate origins\nof life, as well as the causes of their extinction, had been brought\nwithin the domain of naturalistic explanation. It is in this context\nthat he makes the sole reference in the text to the claim that\n“light will be thrown on the origin of man and his\nhistory” (Origin 1859: 488). \nThe broad sweep of Darwin’s claims, the brevity of the empirical\nevidence actually supplied in the text, and the implications of his\ntheory for several more general philosophical and theological issues,\nimmediately opened up a controversy over Darwinian evolution that has\nwaxed and waned over more than 150 years. As is well-known, Darwin\ndeveloped his argument rhetorically with the claims of its explanatory\nsuperiority over the doctrine of “special creation”, which\nhe posed as the main alternative to his account. This stylized\nopposition to “creationism”, rather than to the arguments\nraised by the traditions of Cuvier, Buffon, and Lyell that\ndemonstratively formed the basis of the scientific opposition to\ntransformism before Darwin (see the entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin),\n was a point of considerable criticism by contemporaries such as\nRichard Owen, who held no such theory of special creationism (Bowler\n2013a). But the rhetorical strategy of opposing his theory to theistic\ncreationism served to define much of the popular debate over\nDarwin’s theory in the succeeding period, and continues to\ndefine it in the present. \nOn the level of popular culture, Darwin’s theory fell into a\ncomplex social situation that took on different features in different\nnational traditions. In the anglophone world, the great popularity of\nthe anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation of\n1844, which had reached 11 editions and sold 23,350 copies by December\nof 1860 (Secord “Introduction” to Chambers 1844 reprint\n[1994: xxvii]), with several more editions to appear by the end of the\ncentury, certainly prepared the groundwork for the general notion of\nthe evolutionary origins of species by natural law. The\nVestiges’s grand schema of a teleological development\nof life from the earliest beginnings of the solar system in a gaseous\nnebula to the emergence of humanity under the action of a great\n“law of development”, had also been popularized for\nVictorian readers by Alfred Lord Tennyson’s epic poem In\nMemoriam (1850). This provided a context in which some could read\nDarwin as supplying additional support for the belief in an optimistic\nhistorical development of life under teleological guidance with the\npromise of ultimate historical redemption. Such readings also rendered\nthe Origin seemingly compatible with the progressive\nevolutionism of Herbert Spencer (1820–1903; see the entry on\n Herbert Spencer).\n Spencer’s writings have been shown to be an important vehicle\nby which Darwin’s views, modified to fit the progressivist views\nexpounded by Spencer, were first introduced in non-Western contexts\n(Jin 2019a,b; Yang 2013; Lightman [ed.] 2015; Pusey 1983; Elshakry\n2013) Most of this popular reception ignored or revised Darwin’s\nconcept of evolution by natural selection to fit these progressivist\nalternatives (Bowler 1983). The popular image often depicted of a\ngreat public outcry against Darwin’s work has been shown by\ncareful historical analysis to be generally mythical, or at least in\nneed of careful discrimination by social group, national tradition,\nand religious affiliation (Bowler 2013a; Ellegård 1958). \nAnalysis of the various European receptions of Darwin’s work\ncurrently forms a scholarly industry in its own right (Bowler 2013a;\nGayon 2013; Glick 1974 [1988], 2013; Glick & Shaffer 2014; Engels\n& Glick 2008; Gliboff 2008; Numbers 1998; Pancaldi, 1983 [1991];\nTodes 1989; Kelly 1981; Hull 1973). Studies of non-Western receptions\nis a newer area in Darwin studies. These display similar patterns, but\nalso important differences, from the reception in European contexts\n(Jin 2019a,b; Yang 2013; Shen 2016; Elshakry 2013; Glick 1988\n“Preface”; Pusey 1983). These studies continue to display\na common pattern in which the general reception of Darwin’s\ntheories was conditioned, if not determined, by the pre-existing\nintellectual, scientific, social, and political contexts into which\nDarwin’s theories were inserted. \nThree examples—France, Germany, and China—can be\nelaborated upon. In France, Darwin’s theory was received against\nthe background of the prior debates over transformism of the 1830s\nthat pitted the theories of Lamarck and Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire\nagainst Cuvier (Gayon 2013; entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin,\n 4.1). At least within official Parisian science, these debates had\nbeen resolved in favor of Cuvier’s anti-transformism. Darwin\nwas, as a consequence, viewed as endorsing rejected science by leading\nfigures of French science. As the leading physiologist and\nmethodologist of French Science, Claude Bernard (1813–78) put\nthis in 1865, Darwin’s theory was to be regarded with those of\n“a Goethe, an Oken, a Carus, a Geoffroy Saint Hilaire”,\nlocating it within speculative philosophy of nature rather than\ngranting it the status of “positive” science (Bernard\n1865: 158–159 [1957: 91–92]). The intellectual framework\nprovided by the “positive philosophy” of Auguste Comte\n(1798–1857) also worked both for and against Darwin. On one\nhand, Comte’s emphasis on the historical progress of science\nover superstition and metaphysics allowed Darwin to be summoned in\nsupport of a theory of the progress of science. The Origin\nwas so interpreted in the preface to the first French translation of\nthe Origin made by Clémence Royer (Harvey 2008). On\nthe other hand, the Comtean three stages view of history, with its\nclaim about the historical transcendence of speculative and\nmetaphysical periods of science by a final period of experimental\nscience governed by determinate laws, placed Darwinism in a\nmetaphysical phase of speculative nature philosophy, as captured in\nthe above quotation from Claude Bernard. \nIn the Germanies, Darwin’s work entered a complex social,\nintellectual and political situation in the wake of the failed efforts\nto establish liberal democracy in 1848. It also entered an\nintellectual culture strongly influenced by the pre-existent\nphilosophical traditions of Kant, of Schelling’s\nNaturphilosophie, German Romanticism, and the Idealism of\nFichte and Hegel (R.J. Richards 2002, 2008, 2013; Gliboff 2008, 2007;\nMullen 1964). These factors formed a complex political and\nphilosophical environment into which Darwin’s developmental view\nof nature and theory of the transformation of species was quickly\nassimilated, if also altered. Many readings of Darwin consequently\ninterpreted his arguments against a background of Schelling’s\nphilosophy of nature. Darwin’s role in debates over scientific\nmaterialism were also brought to the fore by the enthusiastic advocacy\nof Darwinism in Germany by University of Jena professor of zoology\nErnst Heinrich Haeckel (1834–1919). More than any other\nindividual, Haeckel made Darwinismus a major player in the\npolarized political and religious disputes of Bismarckian Germany\n(R.J. Richards 2008). Through his polemical writings, such as the\nNatural History of Creation (1868), Anthropogeny\n(1874), and Riddle of the Universe (1895–99), Haeckel\nadvocated a materialist monism in the name of Darwin, and used this as\na stick with which to beat traditional religion. Much of the\nhistorical conflict between religious communities and evolutionary\nbiology can be traced back to Haeckel’s polemical writings,\nwhich went through numerous editions and translations, including\nseveral English and American editions that appeared into the early\ndecades of the twentieth century. \nTo turn to a very different context, that of China, Darwin’s\nworks entered Chinese discussions by a curious route. The initial\ndiscussions of Darwinian theory were generated by the translation of\nThomas Henry Huxley’s 1893 Romanes Lecture “Evolution and\nEthics” by\nthe naval science scholar Yan Fu (1854–1921) who had encountered Darwinism while  being educated at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich from 1877 to 1899.  This translation was  accompanied by Huxley’s\n“Prolegomena”, and was accompanied  with an extensive\ncommentary by Yan Fu drawing heavily upon the writings of Herbert\nSpencer. This translation, published under the name of Tianyan\nLun in 1898, has been shown to have been the main vehicle by\nwhich the Chinese learned of Darwin’s work (Jin 2019a,b; Yang\n2013; Pusey 1983). Beginning in 1902 with a partial translation by Ma\nJunwu (1881–1940), a Chinese scientist, trained in chemistry and metallurgy in\nJapan and Germany, the early chapters of the Origin itself\nwere made available to a Chinese audience. This initial translation of the first five chapters between 1902 and 1906  by\nMa Junwu modified the text to agree with the progressive evolutionism\nof Spencer and with Yan Fu’s popular Tianyan Lun. Only\nin September of 1920 did the Chinese have Ma Junwu’s full\ntranslation of Darwin’s sixth edition. This gave a more faithful\nrendering of Darwin’s text, including an accurate translation of\nDarwin’s final views on natural selection (Jin 2019a,b). As a\npolitical reformer and close associate of democratic reformer Sun\nYat-Sen (1866–1925), Junwu’s concern with Darwin also was\ninvolved in revolutionary Chinese politics (Jin 2019a). \nOne cannot always distinguish between “popular” and\n“professional” receptions of Darwin. The simplest solution\nis to confine the latter designation to those who embraced\nDarwin’s version of a general theory of descent with\nmodification by people with professional research and teaching\npositions in universities and scientific societies, those who were\nintimately familiar with the empirical evidence and the technical\nscientific issues under debate in the 1860s in geology, comparative\nanatomy, embryology, biogeography, and classification theory. This\ngroup can usually be distinguished from lay interpreters who may not\nhave made distinctions between the views of Lamarck, Chambers,\nSchelling, Spencer, and Darwin on the historical development of life.\nBut this only gives a crude instrument of analysis. \nThe case of Ernst Haeckel displays this imprecision. He was a leading\nprofessor of zoology at an important German university (Jena), and he\nformed a generation of scientific workers in embryology and natural\nhistory who had major impact on the history of the life sciences. From\nhis position, Haeckel was able to develop Darwinism both as a popular\nmovement with social and political extensions, and also as a\nscientific research program that pursued the study of morphology and\ncomparative embryology in the light of Darwin’s general theory\n(R.J. Richards 1992: chp. 6, 2008, 2013; Nyhart 1995). \nIf we concentrate on the reception by workers holding professional\npositions in museums, laboratories, and research and teaching\npositions in universities and membership in elite scientific\nsocieties, Darwin’s reception was varied (Bowler 1996; Hull\n1973). Many prominent members of Darwin’s immediate intellectual\ncircle—Adam Sedgwick, William Whewell, Charles Lyell, Richard\nOwen, and Thomas Huxley—had previously been highly critical of\nChambers’s Vestiges in the 1840s for its speculative\ncharacter and its scientific incompetence (Secord 2000). Darwin\nhimself feared a similar reception, and he recognized the substantial\nchallenge facing him in convincing this group and the larger community\nof scientific specialists with which he interacted and corresponded\nwidely. With this group he was only partially successful. \nHistorical studies have revealed that only rarely did members of the\nscientific elites accept and develop Darwin’s theories exactly\nas they were presented in his texts. Statistical studies on the\nreception by the scientific community in England in the first decade\nafter the publication of the Origin have shown a complicated\npicture in which there was neither wide-spread conversion of the\nscientific community to Darwin’s views, nor a clear generational\nstratification between younger converts and older resisters, counter\nto Darwin’s own predictions in the final chapter of the\nOrigin (Hull et al. 1978). These studies also reveal a\ndistinct willingness within the scientific community to separate\nacceptance of Darwin’s more general claim of species descent\nwith modification from common ancestors from the endorsement of his\nexplanation of this descent through the action of natural selection\n(Bowler 1983, 2013a). To utilize the categories of a Lakatosian\n“research program” analysis of scientific theories in\ntheir historical extension, one can distinguish between a “hard\ncore” of defining central assumptions, a “protective\nbelt” of auxiliary hypotheses that protect this central core\nfrom refutations, and a “positive heuristic” of applied\nresearch applications that are subject to continued revision and even\nrefutation (Lakatos 1970). With these distinctions in mind, it is\ndifficult to claim that anything more than the belief in descent from\ncommon ancestry was maintained by a broadly international scientific\ncommunity at the “hard core” level in the period between\n1870–1930. This meant that the historical impact of\nDarwin’s theories on the professional scientific community must\nconsider the important deviations from his own formulations (Bowler\n1983, 2003). \nOf central importance in analyzing this complex professional reception\nwas the role assigned to normal individual variation and its causes.\nIn the initial public presentation of his theory, Darwin had relied on\nthe novel claim that small individual variations—the kind of\ndifferences considered by an earlier tradition as merely\n“accidental”—formed the raw material upon which, by\nunlimited addition through the action of natural selection, major\nchanges could be produced sufficient to explain the origin and\nsubsequent differences in all the various forms of life over time.\nDarwin, however, left the specific causes of this variation unspecified beyond some effect of the environment on the sexual organs.\nVariation was presented in the Origin with the statement that\n“the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown” (Darwin\n1859: 13). In keeping with his commitment to the\ngradualism of Lyellian geology, Darwin also rejected the role of major\n“sports” or other sources of discontinuous change in this\nprocess. \nAs critics focused their attacks on the claim that such\nmicro-differences between individuals could be accumulated over time\nwithout natural limits, Darwin began a series of modifications and\nrevisions of the theory through a back and forth dialogue with his\ncritics that can be followed by revisions to the text of the\nOrigin. In the fourth edition of 1866, for example, Darwin\ninserted the claim that the continuous gradualism illustrated by his\nbranching diagram was misleading, and that transformative change does\nnot necessarily go on continuously. “It is far more probable\nthat each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then again\nundergoes modification” (Origin 1866: 132 [Peckham 1959\n[2006: 213]). This change-stasis-change model presumably allowed\nvariation to stabilize for a period of time around a mean value from\nwhich additional change could then resume. Such a model would,\nhowever, presumably require even more time for its working than the\nmulti-millions of years assumed in the original presentation of the\ntheory. \nThe difficulties in Darwin’s arguments that had emerged by 1866\nwere highlighted in a lengthy and telling critique in 1867 by the\nScottish engineer Henry Fleeming Jenkin (1833–85) (typically\nFleeming Jenkin). Using an argument previously raised in the 1830s by\nCharles Lyell against Lamarck, Fleeming Jenkin cited empirical\nevidence from domestic breeding that suggested a distinct limitation\non the degree of variation, and denied that selection upon this could\nbe taken to the extent assumed by Darwin (Fleeming Jenkin 1867; Hoquet\n2013). Using a loosely mathematical argument, Fleeming Jenkin argued\nthat the effects of intercrossing would continuously swamp deviations\nfrom the mean values of characters and result in a tendency of the\nvariation in a population to return to mean values over time. For\nFleeming Jenkin, Darwin’s reliance on continuous additive\ndeviation was presumed to be undermined by this argument, and only\nmore dramatic and discontinuous change—something Darwin\nexplicitly rejected—could account for the origin of new\nspecies. \nFleeming Jenkin also argued that the time needed by Darwin’s\ntheory was simply inadequate, supporting this claim by an appeal to\nthe physical calculations of the probable age of the earth presented\nin publications by Fleeming Jenkin’s mentor, the Glasgow\nphysicist William Thompson (Lord Kelvin, 1824–1907; Burchfield,\n1975). On the basis of Thompson’s quantitative physical\narguments, Fleeming Jenkin judged the time since the origin of the\nsolar system to be insufficient for the Darwinian gradualist theory of\nspecies transformation to take place. Jenkin’s multi-pronged\nargument gave Darwin considerable difficulties and set the stage for\nmore detailed empirical inquiries into variation and its causes. The\ntime difficulties were only resolved in the twentieth-century with the\ndiscovery of radioactivity. \nAs a solution to the variation question, Darwin developed his\n“provisional hypothesis” of pangenesis, which he presented\nthe year after the appearance of the Fleeming Jenkin review in his\ntwo-volume Variation of Plants and Animals Under\nDomestication (1868, second edition 1875; Olby 2013). Although\nthis theory had been formulated independently of the Jenkin review\n(Olby 1963), in effect it functioned as his reply to it. This offered\na causal theory of variation and inheritance through a return to a\ntheory resembling Buffon’s theory of the organic molecules of\nthe previous century (see entry on\n evolutionary thought before Darwin\n section 3.2). Invisible material “gemmules” were presumed\nto exist within the cells, and according to theory, these were subject\nto possible external alteration by environment and circumstance. The\ngemmules were then shed continually into the blood stream (the\n“transport” hypothesis) and assembled by “mutual affinity for each other, leading to their aggregation into buds or into the sexual elements”\n(Variation 1875: vol. 2: 370). In this form they were then\ntransmitted—the details were not explained—by sexual\ngeneration to the next generation to form the new organism out of\n“units of which each individual is composed” (ibid.). In\nDarwin’s view, this hypothesis united together numerous issues\ninto a coherent and causal theory of inheritance and explained the\nbasis of variation. It also explained how use-disuse inheritance, a\ntheory which Darwin never abandoned, could work. \nThe pangenesis theory, although not specifically referred to, seems to\nbe behind an important distinction he inserted into the fifth edition\nof the Origin of 1869 where he made a direct reply to the\ncriticisms of Jenkin. In this textual revision, Darwin distinguished\n“certain variations, which no one would\nrank as mere individual differences”, from ordinary variations\n(Origin 1869: 105) [Peckham 1959\n[2006: 178–179]]). This revision shifted Darwin’s emphasis\naway from his early reliance on normal slight individual variation,\nand gave new status to what he termed by the sixth edition of 1872 “strongly\nmarked” variations. The latter were now the form of variation to\nbe given primary evolutionary significance, and presumably this was\nmore likely to be transmitted to the offspring, although details are\nleft unclear. In this form it presumably could be maintained in a\npopulation against the tendency to swamping by intercrossing.\nDarwin’s struggles over this issue defined a set of problems\nthat British life scientists in particular were to deal with into the\n1930s. The debates over variation placed Darwinism in a defensive\nposture that forced its supporters into major revisions in the\nDarwinian research program (Gayon 1998; Vorzimmer 1970). The long\nperiod between 1870 and 1930, sometimes characterized as the\n“Eclipse” of Darwinism, or at least of his natural\nselection theory, was the outcome of these debates (Bowler 1983,\n2013a). \nDarwin had retained his own conclusions on human evolution quietly in\nthe background while the defense of his general theory was conducted\nby advocates as diverse as Thomas Henry Huxley (1825–95) in\nEngland, Asa Gray (1810–88) in the United States, and Ernst\nHaeckel (1834–1919) in Germany. Darwin’s own position on\nthe “human question” remained unclear, and his rhetorical\nsituating of the Origin within a tradition of divine creation\nby secondary law, captured in the frontispiece quotations from William\nWhewell and Francis Bacon, retained in all editions, in some degree\nallowed many before 1871 to see Darwin as more open to religious views\nthan those of some of his popularizers. \nIt was in February of 1867 that Darwin decided to remove material from\nhis massive manuscript of the Variation of Plants and Animals\nUnder Domestication and create a “very small volume,\n‘an essay on the origin of mankind’” (Darwin to\nHooker, 8 February 1867 and CD to Turner, 11 February 1867, Burkhardt\net al. 2006 15: 74, 80). At this time he also sent to several\ncorrespondents a questionnaire asking for information on human\nemotional expression. This expanded into a major enterprise in which\nhe became deeply engaged with the issue of the implications of his\ntheory for ethics, writing to Asa Gray that “the difficulties of\nthe Moral sense has [sic] caused me much labor” (CD to Gray, 15 March\n1870, Burkhardt et al. 2010 18: 68). This was expanded into a two volume\nwork by the time it was sent to the printer in June of 1870. By this\ndate he had also pulled out a separate section from the\nVariation manuscript that was to become the Expression of\nthe Emotions in Man and the Animals,published in 1872. \nThe dual publication of the Descent of Man, and Selection in\nRelation to Sex (1871) and the Expression of the\nEmotions (1872) created a watershed in the public reception of\nDarwin’s views (Radick 2013). Although Darwin had first worked\nout many of his views on human evolution in the early “M”\nand “N” Notebooks of 1838–40, public knowledge of\nDarwin’s own conclusions on human evolution rested on the one\nvague sentence on the issue in the Origin itself. The\nDescent, however, made public his more radical conclusions,\nand seemed to many of his readers, even those previously sympathetic\nto the Origin, to throw Darwin’s weight behind\nmaterialist and anti-religious forces spearheaded by such individuals\nas German physiologist Friederich Ludwig Büchner\n(1824–1899), Dutch physiologist Jacob Moleschott\n(1822–93), English socialist and Darwin popularizer Edward\nAveling (1849–98), and German zoologist Ernst Haeckel. Although\nthe question of human evolution had already been dealt with in part by\nThomas Huxley in the Man’s Place in Nature of 1863, by\nCharles Lyell in the same year in his Geological Evidences of the\nAntiquity of Man, by Alfred Russel Wallace in articles in 1864\nand 1870 (Wallace 1864, 1870 and online), and by Haeckel in\nhis Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte of 1868, these\nauthors had either not dealt with the full range of questions\npresented by the inclusion of human beings in the evolutionary process\n(Huxley), or they had emphasized the moral and mental discontinuity\nbetween humans and animals (Lyell, Wallace). Only Haeckel had drawn\nout a more general reductive conception of humanity from evolutionary\ntheory and he had not ventured into the specific issues of ethics,\nsocial organization, the origins of human races, and the relation of\nhuman mental properties to those of animals, all of which are dealt\nwith in the Descent. Darwin’s two-volume treatise\npresented, as one commentator has put it, “a closer resemblance\nto Darwin’s early naturalistic vision than anything else he ever\npublished” (Durant 1985: 294). \nDarwin’s extension of his theory to a range of questions\ntraditionally discussed within philosophy, theology, and social and\npolitical theory, hardened the opposition of many religiously-based\ncommunities to evolutionary theory, although here again, distinctions\nmust be made between different communities (Ellegård 1958: chp.\n14). Such opposition was not simply based upon the denial of the\nliteral scriptural account of the origins of humankind, an issue that\nplayed out differently within the main religious communions (Haught\n2013; Finnegan 2013; Swetlitz 2013; Artigas, Glick, & Martinez\n2006; Moore 1979). The more fundamental opposition was due to the\ndenial of distinctions, other than those of degree, between\nfundamental human properties and those of animals. Furthermore, the\napparent denial of some kind of divine guidance in the processes\nbehind human evolution and the non-teleological character of\nDarwin’s final formulations of the natural selection theory in\nthe fifth and sixth editions of the Origin, hardened this\nopposition. His adoption from Herbert Spencer of designator\n“survival of the fittest” as a synonym for “natural\nselection” in the fifth edition added to this growing\nopposition. As a consequence, the favorable readings that many\ninfluential religious thinkers—John Henry Newman\n(1801–1890) is a good example—had given to the original\nOrigin, disappeared. The rhetoric of the Descent,\nwith its conclusion that “man is descended from a hairy\nquadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears” (1871: vol.\n2: 389), presented to the public a different Darwin than many had\nassociated with the author of the Journal of Researches and\nthe early editions of the Origin. \nMost striking in comparing the Origin to the Descent\nwas the strong emphasis on the workings of the secondary process of\nsexual selection in the animal kingdom (E. Richards 2017;\nR.A. Richards 2013). Sexual selection—the selection of females\nby males or vice versa for breeding purposes—had given a general\nstatement of this principle in chapter four of the Origin,\nbut this played a minor role in the original argument, and its\nimportance was denied by contemporaries like A. R. Wallace. Darwin now\ndeveloped this secondary form of selection in extensive detail as a\nfactor in evolution that could even work against ordinary natural\nselection. Sexual selection could now be marshaled to explain both\nsexual dimorphism and also those character and properties of\norganisms—elaborate feeding organs, bright colors on fish and\nbirds, and seemingly maladaptive structures such as the great horn on\nthe Rhinoceros beetle—, that might appear to be anomalous\noutcomes of ordinary natural selection working to the optimal survival\nof organisms in nature. In a dramatic extension of this principle to\nhuman beings, the combination of natural and sexual selection is used\nto explain the origins of the human beings from simian ancestors. It\nalso explains the sexual dimorphism displayed by human beings, and is\nthe main factor accounting for the origin of human races. \nThe many dimensions of “social” Darwinism that were\naffected by the Descent demand separate articles, as does the\nseparate impact of the Expression of the Emotions, a treatise\nthat in many respects is different in tone and content from the\nDescent. It is also the case that many of the social\nimplications of evolutionary theory were due more to the influence of\nHerbert Spencer than to Darwin’s own writings, and for this\nreason what has been termed “social Darwinism” may have\ndeveloped independently of Darwin (Bowler 2013b). In this closing\nsubsection the author will focus exclusively on one important aspect\nof this broader social impact of the Descent, the Darwinian\ntreatment of ethics. This will be examined within its specific\nVictorian context, rather than in light of more recent discussions of\naltruism within contemporary sociobiology that may owe some filiation\nwith these Darwinian discussion (see entries on\n morality and evolutionary biology\n and\n biological altruism). \nAs can be seen from the letter to Asa Gray of March 1870 (Burkhardt et\nal. 2010 18: 68) , Darwin was\nparticularly exercised by the issue of ethics in preparing the\nDescent. His published treatment focused the long chapter\nthree of the Descent on the issue of the “moral\nsense”. In approaching ethics “exclusively from the side\nof natural history” (Descent 1871: vol 1: 71), he\noffered some innovations that do not easily map on to standard ethical\npositions formulated around the familiar categories of Utilitarianism\nand the Kantian heritage of Deontology. The closest connections might\nbe drawn with certain aspects of contemporary virtue ethics and some\naspects of Natural Law theory, although there are many specific\ndifferences that prevent assimilation to these traditions as well\n(Sloan 1999). His closest historical affinities are with the Scottish\nmoral sense tradition of Adam Smith, David Hume, and particularly as\nthis was developed in the writings of Darwin’s distant relative,\nSir James Macintosh (1765–1832) (R.J. Richards\n1987, 1999, 2003,\n. \nTraditional moral sense theory linked ethical behavior to an innate\nproperty or instinct that was considered universal in human beings,\neven though it required education and cultivation to reach its highest\nexpression (see\n moral sentimentalism\n in this encyclopedia). This inherent property, or “moral\nsense”, presumably explained such phenomena as ethical\nconscience, and it also accounted for altruistic actions that could\nnot be reduced to a hedonic seeking of pleasure and avoiding pain. It\nalso did not involve the rational calculation of advantage by the\nindividual prior to action. \nDarwin’s reinterpretation of the moral sense tradition within\nhis evolutionary framework, however, implied important\ntransformations. The moral sense, for Darwin, was derived by\nbiological descent from animal instinct, and particularly from the\nsocial instincts developed by natural selection. From this\nperspective, Darwin could then argue for a genuine\n“homology” of ethical foundations holding between humans\nand animals, with the precursors of human ethical behavior found in\nthe behavior of other animals, particularly those with social\norganization. Natural and sexual selection then shaped these ethical\ninstincts in ways that favored group survival rather than immediate\nindividual benefit (Descent 1871: vol. 1: 98). Human ethical\nbehavior is therefore grounded in a natural property, and ethical\naction can occur without moral calculus or rational deliberation.\nBecause he considered ethical action to be grounded on a biologically\ninnate property, Darwin criticized John Stuart Mill’s\nUtilitarian theory because it relied on acquired habits rather than\nsomething present in humans from the beginning (1871: vol. 1: 71n5).\nThe innate moral sense is his explanation for self-sacrifice and other\naltruistic acts that cannot be attributed to individual self-survival\n(1871: vol. 1: 86). Humans can be  \nimpelled by the same instinctive motive, which made the heroic little\nAmerican monkey…attack the great and dreaded baboon, to save\nhis keeper. (Descent 1871: vol. 1: 87) \nWhen moral conflict occurs, this is generally attributed to a conflict\nof instincts, with the stronger of two conflicting instincts favored\nby natural selection insofar as it favors group benefit\n(Descent 1871: vol. 1: 84). In human beings the “more\nenduring Social Instincts” thus come to override the less\npersistent “individual” instincts (1871: vol. 1: 87). \nThe adequacy of evolutionary ethical naturalism as a foundation for\nethical realism has been a point of contention for Darwin’s\ncontemporaries and successors since the publication of the\nDescent. For some moral philosophers, Darwin had simply\nreduced ethics to a property subject to the relativizing tendencies of\nnatural selection (Farber 1994: chp. 5). It was, in the view of\nDarwin’s philosophical critics, to reduce ethics to biology and\nin doing so, to offer no way to distinguish ethical goods from\nsurvival advantages. Not even for some strong supporters of Darwinism,\nsuch as Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace, was Darwin’s\naccount adequate (Farber 1994: chp. 4). Much of subsequent moral\nphilosophy was to be grounded upon the canonical acceptance of the\n“is-ought” distinction,  which developed from this critique of\n“evolutionary” ethical theory. Receiving its most\ninfluential expression in G. E. Moore ’s (1873–1958)\nPrincipia Ethica (1903)—itself an attack on\nSpencer’s version of evolutionary ethics—, the debate over\nthe adequacy of evolutionary ethics has continued (Hauser 2006; Katz\n(ed.) 2000; Maienschein & Ruse (eds.) 1999). \nThe historiography adopted in this article rejects a simple linear\nstory of the development of Darwinian theory as a history of\nincreasingly true theories leading to a present consensus. Instead it\nfavors a more complicated “competing research programs”\nanalysis (Lakatos 1970), programs which through historical competition\nhave resulted in more adequate accounts of the relation of living\nbeings to historical time and naturalistic processes, but which show\nrepeated historical competition with one another . \nMore general philosophical issues associated with evolutionary\ntheory—those surrounding natural teleology, ethics, the relation\nof evolutionary naturalism to the claims of religious traditions, the\nimplications for the relation of human beings to the rest of the\norganic world—continue as issues of scholarly inquiry. If\ncontemporary neo-selectionist evolutionary theory displays continuity\nwith select features of the theories of Darwin, alternative\ninterpretations, such as the current movement known as evolutionary\ndevelopmental theory or “evo-devo”, mark a return to\npresumably discarded traditions of the nineteenth and twentieth\ncentury that considered it essential to link evolution with embryonic\ndevelopment and with the effects of external conditions on inheritance\n(Gilbert 2015; Newman 2015; Laubichler & Maienschein 2013, [eds]\n2007; Gissis & Jablonka [eds] 2011; Pigliucci & Müller\n[eds] 2010; Amundson 2005; Gilbert, Opitz, & Raff 1996). Such\ndevelopments suggest that there are still substantial theoretical\nissues at stake that may alter the future understanding of\nevolutionary theory in important ways (Sloan, McKenny, & Eggleson\n[eds] 2015).","contact.mail":"sloan.1@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
