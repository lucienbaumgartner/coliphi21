Locke’s monumental An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding (1689) is one of the first great\ndefenses of modern empiricism and concerns itself with determining the\nlimits of human understanding in respect to a wide spectrum of topics.\nIt thus tells us in some detail what one can legitimately claim to\nknow and what one cannot. Locke’s association with Anthony\nAshley Cooper (later the First Earl of Shaftesbury) led him to become\nsuccessively a government official charged with collecting information\nabout trade and colonies, economic writer, opposition political\nactivist, and finally a revolutionary whose cause ultimately triumphed\nin the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Among Locke’s political\nworks he is most famous for The Second Treatise of Government\nin which he argues that sovereignty resides in the people and explains\nthe nature of legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the\nsocial contract. He is also famous for calling for the separation of\nChurch and State in his Letter Concerning Toleration. Much of\nLocke’s work is characterized by opposition to authoritarianism.\nThis is apparent both on the level of the individual person and on the\nlevel of institutions such as government and church. For the\nindividual, Locke wants each of us to use reason to search after truth\nrather than simply accept the opinion of authorities or be subject to\nsuperstition. He wants us to proportion assent to propositions to the\nevidence for them. On the level of institutions it becomes important\nto distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate functions of\ninstitutions and to make the corresponding distinction for the uses of\nforce by these institutions. Locke believes that using reason to try\nto grasp the truth, and determine the legitimate functions of\ninstitutions will optimize human flourishing for the individual and\nsociety both in respect to its material and spiritual welfare. This in\nturn, amounts to following natural law and the fulfillment of the\ndivine purpose for humanity.\n\nJohn Locke (1632–1704) was one of the greatest philosophers in\nEurope at the end of the seventeenth century. Locke grew up and lived\nthrough one of the most extraordinary centuries of English political\nand intellectual history. It was a century in which conflicts between\nCrown and Parliament and the overlapping conflicts between\nProtestants, Anglicans and Catholics swirled into civil war in the\n1640s. With the defeat and death of Charles I, there began a great\nexperiment in governmental institutions including the abolishment of\nthe monarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican church, and the\nestablishment of Oliver Cromwell’s Protectorate in the 1650s.\nThe collapse of the Protectorate after the death of Cromwell was\nfollowed by the Restoration of Charles II—the return of the\nmonarchy, the House of Lords and the Anglican Church. This period\nlasted from 1660 to 1688. It was marked by continued conflicts between\nKing and Parliament and debates over religious toleration for\nProtestant dissenters and Catholics. This period ends with the\nGlorious Revolution of 1688 in which James II was driven from England\nand replaced by William of Orange and his wife Mary. The final period\nduring which Locke lived involved the consolidation of power by\nWilliam and Mary, and the beginning of William’s efforts to\noppose the domination of Europe by the France of Louis XIV, which\nlater culminated in the military victories of John Churchill—the\nDuke of Marlborough.  \nLocke was born in Wrington to Puritan parents of modest means. His\nfather was a country lawyer who served in a cavalry company on the\nPuritan side in the early stages of the English Civil War. His\nfather’s commander, Alexander Popham, became the local MP, and\nit was his patronage which allowed the young John Locke to gain an\nexcellent education. In 1647 Locke went to Westminster School in\nLondon.  \nFrom Westminster school he went to Christ Church, Oxford, in the\nautumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. As Westminster school was the\nmost important English school, so Christ Church was the most important\nOxford college. Education at Oxford was medieval. Locke, like Hobbes\nbefore him, found the Aristotelian philosophy he was taught at Oxford\nof little use. There was, however, more at Oxford than Aristotle. The\nnew experimental philosophy had arrived. John Wilkins,\nCromwell’s brother in law, had become Warden of Wadham College.\nThe group around Wilkins was the nucleus of what was to become the\nEnglish Royal Society. The Society grew out of informal meetings and\ndiscussion groups and moved to London after the Restoration and became\na formal institution in the 1660s with charters from Charles II. The\nSociety saw its aims in contrast with the Scholastic/Aristotelian\ntraditions that dominated the universities. The program was to study\nnature rather than\n books.[1]\n Many of Wilkins associates were people interested in pursuing\nmedicine by observation rather than the reading of classic texts.\nBacon’s interest in careful experimentation and the systematic\ncollection of facts from which generalizations could be made was\ncharacteristic of this group. One of Locke’s friends from\nWestminster school, Richard Lower, introduced Locke to medicine and\nthe experimental philosophy being pursued by the virtuosi at\nWadham. \nLocke received his B.A. in February 1656. His career at Oxford,\nhowever, continued beyond his undergraduate days. In June of 1658\nLocke qualified as a Master of Arts and was elected a Senior Student\nof Christ Church College. The rank was equivalent to a Fellow at any\nof the other colleges, but was not permanent. Locke had yet to\ndetermine what his career was to be. Locke was elected Lecturer in\nGreek at Christ Church in December of 1660 and he was elected Lecturer\nin Rhetoric in 1663. At this point, Locke needed to make a decision.\nThe statutes of Christ Church laid it down that fifty five of the\nsenior studentships should be reserved for men in orders or reading\nfor orders. Only five could be held by others, two in medicine, two in\nlaw and one in moral philosophy. Thus, there was good reason for Locke\nto become a clergyman. Locke decided to become a doctor. \nJohn Wilkins had left Oxford with the Restoration of Charles II. The\nnew leader of the Oxford scientific group was Robert Boyle. He was\nalso Locke’s scientific mentor. Boyle (with the help of his\nastonishing assistant Robert Hooke) built an air pump which led to the\nformulation of Boyle’s law and devised a barometer as a weather\nindicator. Boyle was, however, most influential as a theorist. He was\na mechanical philosopher who treated the world as reducible to matter\nin motion. Locke read Boyle before he read Descartes. When he did read\nDescartes, he saw the great French philosopher as providing a viable\nalternative to the sterile Aristotelianism he had been taught at\nOxford. In writing An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke adopted Descartes’ ‘way of ideas’; though it\nis transformed so as to become an organic part of Locke’s\nphilosophy. Still, while admiring Descartes, Locke’s involvement\nwith the Oxford scientists gave him a perspective which made him\ncritical of the rationalist elements in Descartes’\nphilosophy. \nIn the Epistle to the Reader at the beginning of the Essay\nLocke remarks: \nThe commonwealth of learning is not at this time without\nmaster-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will\nleave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity: but every one\nmust not hope to be a Boyle or a Sydenham; and in an age that produces\nsuch masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton,\nwith some others of that strain, it is ambition enough to be employed\nas an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing\nsome of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge …. (N:\n9–10; all quotations are from the Nidditch edition of An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding [N])  \nLocke knew all of these men and their work. Locke, Boyle and Newton\nwere all founding or early members of the English Royal Society. It is\nfrom Boyle that Locke learned about atomism (or the corpuscular\nhypothesis) and it is from Boyle’s book The Origin of Forms\nand Qualities that Locke took the language of primary and\nsecondary qualities. Sydenham was an English physician and Locke did\nmedical research with him. Locke read Newton’s Principia\nMathematica Philosophiae Naturalis while in exile in Holland, and\nconsulted Huygens as to the soundness of its mathematics. Locke and\nNewton became friends after Locke’s return from Holland in 1688.\nIt may be that in referring to himself as an\n‘under-labourer’, Locke is not only displaying a certain\nliterary modesty, he is contrasting the positive discoveries of these\nmen, with his own attempt to show the inadequacies of the Aristotelian\nand Scholastic and to some degree the Cartesian philosophies. There\nare, however, many aspects of Locke’s project to which this\nimage of an under-labourer does not do justice (see Jolley 1999:\n15–17). While the corpuscular philosophy and Newton’s\ndiscoveries clearly influenced Locke, it is the Baconian program of\nproducing natural histories that Locke makes reference to when he\ntalks about the Essay in the Introduction. He writes:  \nIt shall suffice to my present Purpose, to consider the discerning\nFaculties of a Man, as they are employ’d about the Objects,\nwhich they have to do with: and I shall imagine that I have not wholly\nmisimploy’d my self in the Thoughts I shall have on this\nOccasion, if in this Historical, Plain Method, I can give any Account\nof the Ways, whereby our Understanding comes to attain those Notions\nof Things, and can set down any Measure of the Certainty of our\nKnowledge…. (I.1.2, N: 43–4—the three numbers, are\nbook, chapter and section numbers respectively, followed by the page\nnumber in the Nidditch edition)  \nThe ‘Historical, Plain Method’ is apparently to give a\ngenetic account of how we come by our ideas. Presumably this will\nreveal the degree of certainty of the knowledge based on such ideas.\nLocke’s own active involvement with the scientific movement was\nlargely through his informal studies of medicine. Dr. David Thomas was\nhis friend and collaborator. Locke and Thomas had a laboratory in\nOxford which was very likely, in effect, a pharmacy. In 1666 Lord\nAshley, one of the richest men in England, came to Oxford in order to\ndrink some medicinal waters there. He had asked Dr. Thomas to provide\nthem. Thomas had to be out of town and asked Locke to see that the\nwater was delivered. As a result of this encounter, Ashley invited\nLocke to come to London as his personal physician. In 1667 Locke did\nmove to London becoming not only Lord Ashley’s personal\nphysician, but secretary, researcher, political operative and friend.\nLiving with him Locke found himself at the very heart of English\npolitics in the 1670s and 1680s.  \nLocke’s chief work while living at Lord Ashley’s\nresidence, Exeter House, in 1668 was as Ashley’s physician, and he organized a successful operation on Ashley that saved his life and thus changed English history. He also worked as secretary of the\nBoard of Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords Proprietors\nof the Carolinas. Lord Ashley was one of the advocates of the view\nthat England would prosper through trade and that colonies could play\nan important role in promoting trade. Ashley persuaded Charles II to\ncreate a Board of Trade and Plantations to collect information about\ntrade and colonies, and Locke became its secretary. In his capacity as\nthe secretary of the Board of Trade Locke was the collection point for\ninformation from around the globe about trade and colonies for the\nEnglish government. Among Ashley’s commercial projects was an\neffort to found colonies in the Carolinas. In his capacity as the\nsecretary to the Lords Proprietors, Locke was involved in the writing\nof the fundamental constitution of the Carolinas. There is some\ncontroversy about the extent of Locke’s role in writing the\n constitution.[2]\n In addition to issues about trade and colonies, Locke was involved\nthrough Shaftesbury in other controversies about public policy. There\nwas a monetary crisis in England involving the value of money, and the\nclipping of coins. Locke wrote papers for Lord Ashley on economic\nmatters, including the coinage crisis.  \nWhile living in London at Exeter House, Locke continued to be involved\nin philosophical discussions. He tells us that: \nWere it fit to trouble thee with the history of this Essay, I should\ntell thee, that five or six friends meeting at my chamber, and\ndiscoursing on a subject very remote from this, found themselves\nquickly at a stand, by the difficulties that rose on every side. After\nwe had awhile puzzled ourselves, without coming any nearer a\nresolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it came into my\nthoughts that we took a wrong course; and that before we set ourselves\nupon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to examine our own\nabilities, and see what objects our understandings were, or were not,\nfitted to deal with. This I proposed to the company, who all readily\nassented; and thereupon it was agreed that this should be our first\ninquiry. Some hasty and undigested thoughts, on a subject I had never\nbefore considered, which I set down against our next meeting, gave the\nfirst entrance into this Discourse; which having been thus begun by\nchance, was continued by intreaty; written by incoherent parcels; and\nafter long intervals of neglect, resumed again, as my humour or\noccasions permitted; and at last, in a retirement where an attendance\non my health gave me leisure, it was brought into that order thou now\nseest it. (Epistle to the Reader, N: 7)  \nJames Tyrrell, one of Locke’s friends was at that meeting. He\nrecalls the discussion being about the principles of morality and\nrevealed religion (Cranston 1957: 140–1). Thus the Oxford\nscholar and medical researcher came to begin the work which was to\noccupy him off and on over the next twenty years.  \nIn 1674 after Shaftesbury had left the government, Locke went back to\nOxford, where he acquired the degree Bachelor of medicine, and a\nlicense to practice medicine, and then went to France (Cranston 1957:\n160). In France Locke went from Calais to Paris, Lyons and on to\nMontpellier, where he spent the next fifteen months. Much of\nLocke’s time was spent learning about Protestantism in France.\nThe Edict of Nantes (promulgated by Henry IV in 1598) was in force,\nand so there was a degree of religious toleration in France. Louis XIV\nwas to revoke the edict in 1685 and French Protestants were then\nkilled while some 400,000 went into exile. \nWhile Locke was in France, Shaftesbury’s fortunes fluctuated. In\n1676 Shaftesbury was imprisoned in the tower. His imprisonment lasted\nfor a year. In 1678, after the mysterious murder of a London judge,\ninformers (most notably Titus Oates) started coming forward to reveal\na supposed Catholic conspiracy to assassinate the King and put his\nbrother on the throne. This whipped up public anti-Catholic frenzy.\nThough Shaftesbury had not fabricated the conspiracy story, nor did he\nprompt Oates to come forward, he did exploit the situation to the\nadvantage of his party. In the public chaos surrounding the\nsensational revelations, Shaftesbury organized an extensive party\nnetwork, exercised great control over elections, and built up a large\nparliamentary majority. His strategy was to secure the passage of an\nExclusion bill that would prevent Charles II’s openly Catholic\nbrother from becoming King. Although the Exclusion bill passed in the\nCommons it was rejected in the House of Lords because of the\nKing’s strong opposition to it. As the panic over the Popish\nplot receded, Shaftesbury was left without a following or a cause.\nShaftesbury was seized on July 21, 1681 and again put in the tower. He\nwas tried on trumped-up charges of treason but acquitted by a London\ngrand jury (filled with his supporters) in November. \nAt this point some of the Country Party leaders began plotting an\narmed insurrection which, had it come off, would have begun with the\nassassination of Charles and his brother on their way back to London\nfrom the races at Newmarket. The chances of such a rising occurring\nwere not as good as the plotters supposed. Memories of the turmoil of\nthe civil war were still relatively fresh. Eventually Shaftesbury, who\nwas moving from safe house to safe house, gave up and fled to Holland\nin November 1682. He died there in January 1683. Locke stayed in\nEngland until the Rye House Plot (named after the house from which the\nplotters were to fire upon the King and his brother) was discovered in\nJune of 1683. Locke left for the West country to put his affairs in\norder the very week the plot was revealed to the government and by\nSeptember he was in exile in\n Holland.[3] \nWhile in exile Locke finished An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding and published a fifty page advanced notice of it in\nFrench. (This was to provide the intellectual world on the continent\nwith most of their information about the Essay until Pierre\nCoste’s French translation appeared in 1704.) He also wrote and\npublished his Epistola de Tolerentia in Latin. Richard\nAshcraft in his Revolutionary Politics and Locke’s Two\nTreatises of Government (1986) suggests that while in Holland\nLocke was not only finishing An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding and nursing his health, he was closely associated\nwith the English revolutionaries in exile. The English government was\nmuch concerned with this group. They tried to get a number of them,\nincluding Locke, extradited to England. Locke’s studentship at\nOxford was taken away from him. In the meanwhile, the English\nintelligence service infiltrated the rebel group in Holland and\neffectively thwarted their efforts—at least for a while. While\nLocke was living in exile in Holland, Charles II died on Feb. 6, 1685\nand was succeeded by his brother—who became James II of England.\nSoon after this the rebels in Holland sent a force of soldiers under\nthe Duke of Monmouth to England to try to overthrow James II. The\nrevolt was crushed, Monmouth captured and executed (Ashcraft 1986).\nFor a meticulous, if cautious review, of the evidence concerning\nLocke’s involvement with the English rebels in exile see Roger\nWoolhouse’s Locke: A Biography (2007). \nUltimately, however, the rebels were successful. James II alienated\nmost of his supporters and William of Orange was invited to bring a\nDutch force to England. After William’s army landed, James II,\nrealizing that he could not mount an effective resistance, fled the\ncountry to exile in France. This became known as the Glorious\nRevolution of 1688. It is a watershed in English history. For it marks\nthe point at which the balance of power in the English government\npassed from the King to the Parliament. Locke returned to England in\n1688 on board the royal yacht, accompanying Princess Mary on her\nvoyage to join her husband. \nAfter his return from exile, Locke published An Essay Concerning\nHuman Understanding and The Two Treatises of Government.\nIn addition, Popple’s translation of Locke’s A Letter\nConcerning Toleration was also published. It is worth noting that\nthe Two Treatises and the Letter Concerning\nToleration were published anonymously. Locke took up residence in\nthe country at Oates in Essex, the home of Sir Francis and Lady Masham\n(Damaris Cudworth). Locke had met Damaris Cudworth in 1682 and became\ninvolved intellectually and romantically with her. She was the\ndaughter of Ralph Cudworth, the Cambridge Platonist, and a philosopher\nin her own right. After Locke went into exile in Holland in 1683, she\nmarried Sir Francis Masham. Locke and Lady Masham remained good\nfriends and intellectual companions to the end of Locke’s life.\nDuring the remaining years of his life Locke oversaw four more\neditions of the Essay and engaged in controversies over the\nEssay most notably in a series of published letters with\nEdward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester. In a similar way, Locke\ndefended the Letter Concerning Toleration against a series of\nattacks. He wrote The Reasonableness of Christianity and\nSome Thoughts on Education during this period as well. \nNor was Locke finished with public affairs. In 1696 the Board of Trade\nwas revived. Locke played an important part in its revival and served\nas the most influential member on it until 1700. The new Board of\nTrade had administrative powers and was, in fact, concerned with a\nwide range of issues, from the Irish wool trade and the suppression of\npiracy, to the treatment of the poor in England and the governance of\nthe colonies. It was, in Peter Laslett’s phrase “the body\nwhich administered the United States before the American\nRevolution” (Laslett 1954 [1990: 127]). During these last eight\nyears of his life, Locke was asthmatic, and he suffered so much from\nit that he could only bear the smoke of London during the four warmer\nmonths of the year. Locke plainly engaged in the activities of the\nBoard out of a strong sense of patriotic duty. After his retirement\nfrom the Board of Trade in 1700, Locke remained in retirement at Oates\nuntil his death on Sunday 28 October 1704. \nLocke is often classified as the first of the great English\nempiricists (ignoring the claims of Bacon and Hobbes). This reputation\nrests on Locke’s greatest work, the monumental An Essay\nConcerning Human Understanding. Locke explains his project in\nseveral places. Perhaps the most important of his goals is to\ndetermine the limits of human understanding. Locke writes:  \nFor I thought that the first Step towards satisfying the several\nEnquiries, the Mind of Man was apt to run into, was, to take a Survey\nof our own Understandings, examine our own Powers, and see to what\nThings they were adapted. Till that was done, I suspected that we\nbegan at the wrong end, and in vain sought for Satisfaction in a quiet\nand secure Possession of Truths, that most concern’d us whilst\nwe let loose our Thoughts into the vast Ocean of Being, as if\nall the boundless Extent, were the natural and undoubted Possessions\nof our Understandings, wherein there was nothing that escaped its\nDecisions, or that escaped its Comprehension. Thus Men, extending\ntheir Enquiries beyond their Capacities, and letting their Thoughts\nwander into those depths where they can find no sure Footing;\n’tis no Wonder, that they raise Questions and multiply Disputes,\nwhich never coming to any clear Resolution, are proper to only\ncontinue and increase their Doubts, and to confirm them at last in a\nperfect Skepticism. Wheras were the Capacities of our Understanding\nwell considered, the Extent of our Knowledge once discovered, and the\nHorizon found, which sets the boundary between the enlightened and the\ndark Parts of Things; between what is and what is not comprehensible\nby us, Men would perhaps with less scruple acquiesce in the\navow’d Ignorance of the one; and employ their Thoughts and\nDiscourse, with more Advantage and Satisfaction in the other. (I.1.7,\nN: 47)  \nSome philosophers before Locke had suggested that it would be good to\nfind the limits of the Understanding, but what Locke does is to carry\nout this project in detail. In the four books of the Essay\nLocke considers the sources and nature of human knowledge. Book I\nargues that we have no innate knowledge. (In this he resembles\nBerkeley and Hume, and differs from Descartes and Leibniz.) So, at\nbirth, the human mind is a sort of blank slate on which experience\nwrites. In Book II Locke claims that ideas are the materials of\nknowledge and all ideas come from experience. The term\n‘idea’, Locke tells us “…stands for\nwhatsoever is the Object of the Understanding, when a man\nthinks” (I.1.8, N: 47). Experience is of two kinds, sensation\nand reflection. One of these—sensation—tells us about\nthings and processes in the external world. The\nother—reflection—tells us about the operations of our own\nminds. Reflection is a sort of internal sense that makes us conscious\nof the mental processes we are engaged in. Some ideas we get only from\nsensation, some only from reflection and some from both. \nLocke has an atomic or perhaps more accurately a corpuscular theory of\n ideas.[4]\n There is, that is to say, an analogy between the way atoms or\ncorpuscles combine into complexes to form physical objects and the way\nideas combine. Ideas are either simple or complex. We cannot create\nsimple ideas, we can only get them from experience. In this respect\nthe mind is passive. Once the mind has a store of simple ideas, it can\ncombine them into complex ideas of a variety of kinds. In this respect\nthe mind is active. Thus, Locke subscribes to a version of the\nempiricist axiom that there is nothing in the intellect that was not\npreviously in the senses—where the senses are broadened to\ninclude reflection. Book III deals with the nature of language, its\nconnections with ideas and its role in knowledge. Book IV, the\nculmination of the previous reflections, explains the nature and\nlimits of knowledge, probability, and the relation of reason and\nfaith. Let us now consider the Essay in some detail. \nAt the beginning of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke says that since his purpose is “to enquire into the\nOriginal, Certainty and Extent of human knowledge, together with the\ngrounds and degrees of Belief, Opinion and Assent” he is going\nto begin with ideas—the materials out of which knowledge is\nconstructed. His first task is to “enquire into the Original of\nthese Ideas…and the ways whereby the Understanding comes to be\nfurnished with them” (I.1.3, N: 44). The role of Book I of the\nEssay is to make the case that being innate is not a way in\nwhich the understanding is furnished with principles and ideas. Locke\ntreats innateness as an empirical hypothesis and argues that there is\nno good evidence to support it. \nLocke describes innate ideas as “some primary\nnotions…Characters as it were stamped upon the Mind of Man,\nwhich the Soul receives in its very first Being; and brings into the\nworld with it” (I.2.1, N: 48). In pursuing this enquiry, Locke\nrejects the claim that there are speculative innate principles (I.2),\npractical innate moral principles (I.3) or that we have innate ideas\nof God, identity or impossibility (I.4). Locke rejects arguments from\nuniversal assent and attacks dispositional accounts of innate\nprinciples. Thus, in considering what would count as evidence from\nuniversal assent to such propositions as “What is, is” or\n“It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be”\nhe holds that children and idiots should be aware of such truths if\nthey were innate but that they “have not the least apprehension\nor thought of them”. Why should children and idiots be aware of\nand able to articulate such propositions? Locke says:  \nIt seems to me a near Contradiction to say that there are truths\nimprinted on the Soul, which it perceives or understands not;\nimprinting if it signify anything, being nothing else but the making\ncertain Truths to be perceived. (I.2.5, N: 49)  \nSo, Locke’s first point is that if propositions were innate they\nshould be immediately perceived—by infants and idiots (and\nindeed everyone else)—but there is no evidence that they are.\nLocke then proceeds to attack dispositional accounts that say,\nroughly, that innate propositions are capable of being perceived under\ncertain circumstances. Until these circumstances come about the\npropositions remain unperceived in the mind. With the advent of these\nconditions, the propositions are then perceived. Locke gives the\nfollowing argument against innate propositions being\ndispositional: \nFor if any one [proposition] may [be in the mind but not be known];\nthen, by the same Reason, all Propositions that are true, and the Mind\nis ever capable of assenting to, may be said to be in the Mind, and to\nbe imprinted: since if any one can be said to be in the Mind, which it\nnever yet knew, it must be only because it is capable of knowing it;\nand so the Mind is of all Truths it ever shall know. (I.2.5, N: 50)\n \nThe essence of this argument and many of Locke’s other arguments\nagainst dispositional accounts of innate propositions is that such\ndispositional accounts do not provide an adequate criterion for\ndistinguishing innate propositions from other propositions that the\nmind may come to discover. Thus, even if some criterion is proposed,\nit will turn out not to do the work it is supposed to do.  \nWhen Locke turns from speculative principles to the question of\nwhether there are innate practical moral principles, many of the\narguments against innate speculative principles continue to apply, but\nthere are some additional considerations. Practical principles, such\nas the Golden Rule, are not self-evident in the way such speculative\nprinciples as “What is, is” are. Thus, one can clearly and\nsensibly ask reasons for why one should hold the Golden Rule true or\nobey it (I.3.4, N: 68). There are substantial differences between\npeople over the content of practical principles. Thus, they are even\nless likely candidates to be innate propositions or to meet the\ncriterion of universal assent. In the fourth chapter of Book I, Locke\nraises similar points about the ideas which compose both speculative\nand practical principles. The point is that if the ideas that are\nconstitutive of the principles are not innate, this gives us even more\nreason to hold that the principles are not innate. He examines the\nideas of identity, impossibility and God to make these points. \nIn Book I Locke says little about who holds the doctrine of innate\nprinciples that he is attacking. For this reason he has sometimes been\naccused of attacking straw men. John Yolton has persuasively argued\n(Yolton 1956) that the view that innate ideas and principles were\nnecessary for the stability of religion, morality and natural law was\nwidespread in England in the seventeenth century, and that in\nattacking both the naive and the dispositional account of innate ideas\nand innate principles, Locke is attacking positions which were widely\nheld and continued to be held after the publication of the\nEssay. Thus, the charge that Locke’s account of innate\nprinciples is made of straw, is not a just criticism. But there are\nalso some important connections with particular philosophers and\nschools that are worth noting and some points about innate ideas and\ninquiry. \nAt I. 4. 24. Locke tells us that the doctrine of innate principles\nonce accepted “eased the lazy from the pains of search”\nand that the doctrine is an inquiry stopper that is used by those who\n“affected to be Masters and Teachers” to illegitimately\ngain control of the minds of their students. Locke rather clearly has\nin mind the Aristotelians and scholastics at the universities. Thus\nLocke’s attack on innate principles is connected with his\nanti-authoritarianism. It is an expression of his view of the\nimportance of free and autonomous inquiry in the search for truth.\nUltimately, Locke holds, this is the best road to knowledge and\nhappiness. Locke, like Descartes, is tearing down the foundations of\nthe old Aristotelian scholastic house of knowledge. But while\nDescartes focused on the empiricism at the foundation of the\nstructure, Locke is focusing on the claims that innate ideas provide\nits first principles. The attack on innate ideas is thus the first\nstep in the demolition of the scholastic model of science and\nknowledge. Ironically, it is also clear from II.1.9. that Locke sees\nDescartes’ claim that his essence is to be a thinking thing as\nentailing a doctrine of innate ideas and principles.  \nIn Book II of the Essay, Locke gives his positive account of\nhow we acquire the materials of knowledge. Locke distinguishes a\nvariety of different kinds of ideas in Book II. Locke holds that the\nmind is a tabula rasa or blank sheet until experience in the\nform of sensation and reflection provide the basic\nmaterials—simple ideas—out of which most of our more\ncomplex knowledge is constructed. While the mind may be a blank slate\nin regard to content, it is plain that Locke thinks we are born with a\nvariety of faculties to receive and abilities to manipulate or process\nthe content once we acquire it. Thus, for example, the mind can engage\nin three different types of action in putting simple ideas together.\nThe first of these kinds of action is to combine them into complex\nideas. Complex ideas are of two kinds, ideas of substances and ideas\nof modes. Substances are independent existences. Beings that count as\nsubstances include God, angels, humans, animals, plants and a variety\nof constructed things. Modes are dependent existences. These include\nmathematical and moral ideas, and all the conventional language of\nreligion, politics and culture. The second action which the mind\nperforms is the bringing of two ideas, whether simple or complex, by\none another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting\nthem. This gives us our ideas of relations (II.12.1, N: 163). The\nthird act of the mind is the production of our general ideas by\nabstraction from particulars, leaving out the particular circumstances\nof time and place, which would limit the application of an idea to a\nparticular individual. In addition to these abilities, there are such\nfaculties as memory which allow for the storing of ideas. \nHaving set forth the general machinery of how simple and complex ideas\nof substances, modes, relations and so forth are derived from\nsensation and reflection, Locke also explains how a variety of\nparticular kinds of ideas, such as the ideas of solidity, number,\nspace, time, power, identity, and moral relations arise from sensation\nand reflection. Several of these are of particular interest.\nLocke’s chapter on power gives rise to a discussion of free will\nand voluntary action (see the entry on\n Locke on freedom).\n Locke also made a number of interesting claims in the philosophy of\nmind. He suggested, for example, that for all we know, God could as\neasily add the powers of perception and thought to matter organized in\nthe right way as he could add those powers to an immaterial substance\nwhich would then be joined to matter organized in the right way. His\naccount of personal identity in II. xxvii was revolutionary. Both of\nthese topics and related ones are treated in the supplementary\ndocument:\n Some Interesting Issues in Locke’s Philosophy of Mind\n  \nIn what follows, we focus on some central issues in Locke’s\naccount of physical objects. (See also the entry\n Locke’s philosophy of science,\n which pursues a number of topics related to Locke’s account of\nphysical objects that are of considerable importance but largely\nbeyond the scope of this general account of Locke’s philosophy.)\nThese include Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy, the\nlimitations of the corpuscular philosophy and Locke’s relation\nto Newton. \nLocke offers an account of physical objects based in the mechanical\nphilosophy and the corpuscular hypothesis. The adherents of the\nmechanical philosophy held that all material phenomena can be\nexplained by matter in motion and the impact of one body on another.\nThey viewed matter as passive. They rejected the “occult\nqualities” and “causation at a distance” of the\nAristotelian and Scholastic philosophy. Robert Boyle’s\ncorpuscularian hypothesis treated the material world as made up of\nparticles. Some corpuscularians held that corpuscles could be further\ndivided and that the universe was full of matter with no void space.\nAtomists, on the other hand, held that the particles were indivisible\nand that the material world is composed of atoms and the void or empty\nspace in which the atoms move. Locke was an atomist. \nAtoms have properties. They are extended, they are solid, they have a\nparticular shape and they are in motion or rest. They combine together\nto produce the familiar stuff and physical objects, the gold and the\nwood, the horses and violets, the tables and chairs of our world.\nThese familiar things also have properties. They are extended, solid,\nhave a particular shape and are in motion and at rest. In addition to\nthese properties that they share with the atoms that compose them,\nthey have other properties such as colors, smells, tastes that they\nget by standing in relation to perceivers. The distinction between\nthese two kinds of properties goes back to the Greek atomists. It is\narticulated by Galileo and Descartes as well as Locke’s mentor\nRobert Boyle. \nLocke makes this distinction in Book II Chapter 8 of the\nEssay and using Boyle’s terminology calls the two\ndifferent classes of properties the primary and secondary qualities of\nan object. This distinction is made by both of the main branches of\nthe mechanical philosophy of the seventeenth and early eighteenth\ncentury. Both the Cartesian plenum theorists, who held that the world\nwas full of infinitely divisible matter and that there was no void\nspace, and the atomists such as Gassendi, who held that there were\nindivisible atoms and void space in which the atoms move, made the\ndistinction between these two classes of properties. Still, the\ndifferences between these two branches of the mechanical philosophy\naffect their account of primary qualities. In the chapter on Solidity\n(II.4) Locke rejects the Cartesian definition of body as simply\nextended and argues that bodies are both extended and impenetrable or\nsolid. The inclusion of solidity in Locke’s account of bodies\nand of primary qualities distinguishes them from the void space in\nwhich they move.  \nThe primary qualities of an object are properties which the object\npossesses independent of us—such as occupying space, being\neither in motion or at rest, having solidity and texture. The\nsecondary qualities are powers in bodies to produce ideas in us like\ncolor, taste, smell and so on that are caused by the interaction of\nour particular perceptual apparatus with the primary qualities of the\nobject. Our ideas of primary qualities resemble the qualities in the\nobject, while our ideas of secondary qualities do not resemble the\npowers that cause them. Locke also distinguishes a second class of\nsecondary properties that are the powers that one substance has to\neffect another, e.g. the power of a fire to melt a piece of wax. \nThere has been considerable scholarly debate concerning the details of\nLocke’s account of the distinction. Among the issues are which\nqualities Locke assigns to each of the two categories. Locke gives\nseveral lists. Another issue is what the criterion is for putting a\nquality in one list rather than another. Does Locke hold that all the\nideas of secondary qualities come to us by one sense while the ideas\nof primary qualities come to us through two or is Locke not making the\ndistinction in this way? Another issue is whether there are only\nprimary qualities of atoms or whether compounds of atoms also have\nprimary qualities. And while Locke claims our ideas of primary\nqualities resemble the primary qualities in objects, and the ideas of\nsecondary qualities do not resemble their causes in the object, what\ndoes ‘resemble’ mean in this context? Related to this\nissue is how we are supposed to know about particles that we cannot\nsense. It seems clear that Locke holds that there are certain\nanalogies between the middle sized macroscopic objects we encounter in\nthe world, e.g. porphyry and manna for example, and the particles that\ncompose these things. Maurice Mandelbaum called this process\n‘transdiction’. These analogies allow us to say certain\nthings about the nature of particles and primary and secondary\nqualities. For example we can infer that atoms are solid and that heat\nis a greater rate of motion of atoms while cold is a slower motion.\nBut these analogies may not get us very far in grasping the necessary\nconnections between qualities in nature. Yet another issue is whether\nLocke sees the distinction as reductionistic. If what we mean by\nreductionistic here is that only the primary qualities are real and\nthese explain the secondary qualities then there does not seem to be a\nclear answer. Secondary qualities surely are nothing more than certain\nprimary qualities that affect us in certain ways. This seems to be\nreductionistic. But on Locke’s account of “real\nideas” in II.30 both the ideas of primary and secondary\nqualities count as real. And while Locke holds that our ideas of\nsecondary qualities are caused by primary qualities, in certain\nimportant respects the primary qualities do not explain them. Locke\nholds that we cannot even conceive how the size, figure and motion of\nparticles could cause any sensation in us. So, knowing the size,\nfigure and motion of the particles would be of no use to us in this\nregard (see IV.3.11–40, N: 544–546). \nLocke probably holds some version of the representational theory of\nperception, though some scholars dispute this. On such a theory what\nthe mind immediately perceives are ideas, and the ideas are caused by\nand represent the objects which cause them. Thus perception is a\ntriadic relation, rather than simply being a dyadic relation between\nan object and a perceiver. Such a dyadic relational theory is often\ncalled naive realism because it suggests that the perceiver is\ndirectly perceiving the object, and naive because this view is open to\na variety of serious objections. Some versions of the representational\ntheory are open to serious objections as well. If, for example, one\ntreats ideas as things, then one can imagine that because one sees\nideas, the ideas actually block one from seeing things in the external\nworld. The idea would be like a picture or painting. The picture would\ncopy the original object in the external world, but because our\nimmediate object of perception is the picture we would be prevented\nfrom seeing the original just as standing in front of a painting on an\neasel might prevent us from seeing the person being painted. Thus,\nthis is sometimes called the picture/original theory of perception.\nAlternatively, Jonathan Bennett called it “the veil of\nperception” to emphasize that ‘seeing’ the ideas\nprevents us from seeing the external world. One philosopher who\narguably held such a view was Nicholas Malebranche, a follower of\nDescartes. Antoine Arnauld, by contrast, while believing in the\nrepresentative character of ideas, is a direct realist about\nperception. Arnauld engaged in a lengthy controversy with Malebranche,\nand criticized Malebranche’s account of ideas. Locke follows\nArnauld in his criticism of Malebranche on this point (Locke, 1823,\nVol. IX: 250). Yet Berkeley attributed the veil of perception\ninterpretation of the representational theory of perception to Locke\nas have many later commentators including Bennett. A.D. Woozley puts\nthe difficulty of doing this succinctly:  \n…it is scarcely credible both that Locke should be able to see\nand state so clearly the fundamental objection to the picture-original\ntheory of sense perception, and that he should have held the same\ntheory himself. (Woozley 1964: 27)  \nJust what Locke’s account of perception involves, is still a\nmatter of scholarly debate. A review of this issue at a symposium\nincluding John Rogers, Gideon Yaffe, Lex Newman, Tom Lennon, and Vere\nChappell at a meeting of the Pacific Division of the American\nPhilosophical Association in 2003 and later expanded and published in\nthe Pacific Philosophical Quarterly (2004, volume 85, issue\n3) found most of the symposiasts holding the view that Locke holds a\nrepresentative theory of perception but that he is not a skeptic about\nthe external world in the way that the veil of perception doctrine\nmight suggest.  \nAnother issue that has been a matter of controversy since the first\npublication of the Essay is what Locke means by the term\n‘substance’. The primary/secondary quality distinction\ngets us a certain ways in understanding physical objects, but Locke is\npuzzled about what underlies or supports the primary qualities\nthemselves. He is also puzzled about what material and immaterial\nsubstances might have in common that would lead us to apply the same\nword to both. These kinds of reflections led him to the relative and\nobscure idea of substance in general. This is an “I know not\nwhat” which is the support of qualities which cannot subsist by\nthemselves. We experience properties appearing in regular clumps, but\nwe must infer that there is something that supports or perhaps\n‘holds together’ those qualities. For we have no\nexperience of that supporting substance. It is clear that Locke sees\nno alternative to the claim that there are substances supporting\nqualities. He does not, for example, have a theory of tropes (tropes\nare properties that can exist independently of substances) which he\nmight use to dispense with the notion of substance. (In fact, he may\nbe rejecting something like a theory of tropes when he rejects the\nAristotelian doctrine of real qualities and insists on the need for\nsubstances.) He is thus not at all a skeptic about\n‘substance’ in the way that Hume is. But, it is also quite\nclear that he is regularly insistent about the limitations of our\nideas of substances. Bishop Stillingfleet accused Locke of putting\nsubstance out of the reasonable part of the world. But Locke is not\ndoing that. \nSince Berkeley, Locke’s doctrine of the substratum or substance\nin general has been attacked as incoherent. It seems to imply that we\nhave a particular without any properties, and this seems like a notion\nthat is inconsistent with empiricism. We have no experience of such an\nentity and so no way to derive such an idea from experience. Locke\nhimself acknowledges this point (I.4.18, N: 95). In order to avoid\nthis problem, Michael Ayers has proposed that we must understand the\nnotions of ‘substratum’ and ‘substance in\ngeneral’ in terms of Locke’s distinction between real and nominal essences and particularly his doctrine of real essences\ndeveloped in Book III of the Essay rather than as a separate\nproblem from that of knowing real essences. The real essence of a\nmaterial thing is its atomic constitution. This atomic constitution is\nthe causal basis of all the observable properties of the thing, from which we create nominal essences. Were the real essence known, all the observable properties could be deduced\nfrom it. Locke claims that the real essences of material things are\nquite unknown to us. Locke’s concept of substance in general is\nalso a ‘something I know not what’. Thus, on Ayers’\ninterpretation ‘substance in general’ means something like\n‘whatever it is that supports qualities’ while the real essence means ‘this particular atomic constitution that explains this set of observable qualities’. Thus, Ayers wants to treat\nthe unknown substratum as picking out the same thing as the real\nessence—thus eliminating the need for particulars without\nproperties. This proposed way of interpreting Locke has been\ncriticized by scholars both because of a lack of textural support, and\non the stronger grounds that it conflicts with some things that Locke\ndoes say (see Jolley 1999: 71–3). As we have reached one of the\nimportant concepts in Book III, let us turn to that Book and\nLocke’s discussion of language. \nLocke devotes Book III of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding to language. This is a strong indication that Locke\nthinks issues about language were of considerable importance in\nattaining knowledge. At the beginning of the Book he notes the\nimportance of abstract general ideas to knowledge. These serve as\nsorts under which we rank all the vast multitude of particular\nexistences. Thus, abstract ideas and classification are of central\nimportance in Locke’s discussion of language and its importance for knowledge. Without general terms and classes we would be faced with the impossible task of trying to know a vast world of particulars. \nThere is a clear connection between Books II and III in that Locke\nclaims that words stand for ideas. In his discussion of language Locke\ndistinguishes words according to the categories of ideas established\nin Book II of the Essay. So there are ideas of substances,\nsimple modes, mixed modes, relations and so on. It is in this context\nthat Locke makes the distinction between real and nominal essences\nnoted above. Perhaps because of his focus on the role that kind terms\nplay in classification, Locke pays vastly more attention to nouns than\nto verbs. Locke recognizes that not all words relate to ideas. There\nare also the many particles, words that “…signify the\nconnexion that the Mind gives to Ideas, or Propositions, one with\nanother” (II.7.1, N: 471). Still, it is the relation of words\nand ideas that gets most of Locke’s attention in Book III. \nNorman Kretzmann calls the claim that “words in their primary or\nimmediate signification signify nothing but the ideas in the mind\nof him that uses them” (III.2.2) “Locke’s main semantic thesis” (see Kretzmann 1968:179). This\nthesis has often been criticized as a classic blunder in semantic\ntheory. Thus Mill, for example, wrote, “When I say, ‘the\nsun is the cause of the day’, I do not mean that my idea of the\nsun causes or excites in me the idea of day” (Mill 1843: bk 1,\nch. 2, § 1). This criticism of Locke’s account of language\nparallels the “veil of perception” critique of his account\nof perception and suggests that Locke is not distinguishing the\nmeaning of a word from its reference. Kretzmann, however, argues\npersuasively that Locke distinguishes between meaning and reference\nand that ideas provide the meaning but not the reference of words.\nThus, the line of criticism represented by the quotation from Mill is\nill founded. \nIn addition to the kinds of ideas noted above, there are also\nparticular and abstract ideas. Particular ideas have in them the ideas\nof particular places and times which limit the application of the idea\nto a single individual, while abstract general ideas leave out the\nideas of particular times and places in order to allow the idea to\napply to other similar qualities or things. There has been\nconsiderable philosophical and scholarly debate about the nature of\nthe process of abstraction and Locke’s account of it. Berkeley\nargued that the process as Locke conceives it is incoherent. In part\nthis is because Berkeley is an imagist—that is he believes that\nall ideas are images. If one is an imagist it becomes impossible to\nimagine what idea could include both the ideas of a right and\nequilateral triangle. Michael Ayers has recently argued that Locke too\nwas an imagist. This would make Berkeley’s criticism of Locke\nvery much to the point. Ayers’ claim, however, has been disputed\n(see, for example, Soles 1999). The process of abstraction is of\nconsiderable importance to human knowledge. Locke thinks most words we\nuse are general (III.1.1, N: 409). Clearly, it is only general or\nsortal ideas that can serve in a classificatory scheme. \nIn his discussion of names of substances and in the contrast between\nnames of substances and names of modes, a number of interesting\nfeatures of Locke’s views about language and knowledge emerge.\nPhysical substances are atoms and things made up of atoms. But we have\nno experience of the atomic structure of horses and tables. We know\nhorses and tables mainly by secondary qualities such as color, taste\nand smell and so on and primary qualities such as shape, motion and\nextension. So, since the real essence (the atomic constitution) of a\nhorse is unknown to us, our word ‘horse’ cannot get its\nmeaning from that real essence. What the general word signifies is the\ncomplex of ideas we have decided are parts of the idea of that sort of\nthing. These ideas we get from experience. Locke calls such a general\nidea that picks out a sort, the nominal essence of that sort. \nOne of the central issues in Book III has to do with classification.\nOn what basis do we divide things into kinds and organize those kinds\ninto a system of species and genera? In the Aristotelian and\nScholastic tradition that Locke rejects, necessary properties are\nthose that an individual must have in order to exist and continue to\nexist. These contrast with accidental properties. Accidental\nproperties are those that an individual can gain and lose and yet\ncontinue in existence. If a set of necessary properties is shared by a\nnumber of individuals, that set of properties constitutes the essence\nof a natural kind. The borders between kinds is supposed to be sharp\nand determinate. The aim of Aristotelian science is to discover the\nessences of natural kinds. Kinds can then be organized hierarchically\ninto a classificatory system of species and genera. This\nclassification of the world by natural kinds will be unique and\nprivileged because it alone corresponds to the structure of the world.\nThis doctrine of essences and kinds is often called Aristotelian\nessentialism. Locke rejects a variety of aspects of this doctrine. He\nrejects the notion that an individual has an essence apart from being\ntreated as belonging to a kind. He also rejects the claim that there\nis a single classification of things in nature that the natural\nphilosopher should seek to discover. He holds that there are many\npossible ways to classify the world each of which might be\nparticularly useful depending on one’s purposes. \nLocke’s pragmatic account of language and the distinction\nbetween nominal and real essences constitute an anti-essentialist\nalternative to this Aristotelian essentialism and its correlative\naccount of the classification of natural kinds. He claims that there\nare no fixed boundaries in nature to be discovered—that is there\nare no clear demarcation points between species. There are always\nborderline cases. There is debate over whether Locke’s view is\nthat this lack of fixed boundaries is true on both the level of\nappearances and nominal essences, and atomic constitutions and real\nessences, or on the level of nominal essences alone. The first view is\nthat Locke holds that there are no Aristotelian natural kinds on\neither the level of appearance or atomic reality. The second view\nholds that Locke thinks there are Aristotelian natural kinds on the\natomic level, it is simply that we cannot get at them or know what\nthey are. On either of these interpretations, the real essence cannot\nprovide the meaning to names of substances. A.O. Lovejoy in the\nGreat Chain of Being, and David Wiggins are proponents of the\nsecond interpretation while Michael Ayers and William Uzgalis argue\nfor the first (Uzgalis 1988; Ayers 1991: II. 70). \nBy contrast, the ideas that we use to make up our nominal essences\ncome to us from experience. Locke claims that the mind is active in\nmaking our ideas of sorts and that there are so many properties to\nchoose among that it is possible for different people to make quite\ndifferent ideas of the essence of a certain substance. This has given\nsome commentators the impression that the making of sorts is utterly\narbitrary and conventional for Locke and that there is no basis for\ncriticizing a particular nominal essence. Sometimes Locke says things\nthat might suggest this. But this impression should be resisted. Peter\nAnstey has characterized Locke’s conventionalism about\nclassificatory terms as both constrained and convergent (Anstey 2011:\n209, 212). Locke claims that while the making of nominal essences is\nthe work of the understanding, that work is constrained both by usage\n(where words stand for ideas that are already in use) and by the fact\nthat substance words are supposed to copy the properties of the\nsubstances they refer to. Locke says that our ideas of kinds of\nsubstances have as their archetype the complex of properties that\nproduce the appearances we use to make our nominal essences and which\ncause the unity of the complex of ideas which appear to us regularly\nconjoined. The very notion of an archetype implies constraints on what\nproperties (and hence what ideas) can go together. If there were no\nsuch constraints there could be no archetype.  \nLet us begin with the usage of words. It is important in a\ncommunity of language users that words be used with the same meaning.\nIf this condition is met it facilitates the chief end of language\nwhich is communication. If one fails to use words with the meaning\nthat most people attach to them, one will fail to communicate\neffectively with others. Thus one would defeat the main purpose of\nlanguage. It should also be noted that traditions of usage for Locke\ncan be modified. Otherwise we would not be able to improve our\nknowledge and understanding by getting more clear and determinate\nideas. \nIn the making of the names of substances there is a period of\ndiscovery as the abstract general idea is put together (e.g. the\ndiscovery of violets or gold) and then the naming of that idea and\nthen its introduction into language. Language itself is viewed as an\ninstrument for carrying out the mainly prosaic purposes and practices\nof every day life. Ordinary people are the chief makers of\nlanguage. \nVulgar Notions suit vulgar Discourses; and both though confused\nenough, yet serve pretty well for the Market and the Wake. Merchants\nand Lovers, Cooks and Taylors, have Words wherewith to dispatch their\nordinary affairs; and so, I think, might Philosophers and Disputants\ntoo, if they had a mind to understand and to be clearly understood.\n(III.11.10, N: 514)  \nThese ordinary people use a few apparent qualities, mainly ideas of\nsecondary qualities to make ideas and words that will serve their\npurposes.  \nNatural philosophers (i.e. scientists) come along later to try to determine if the connections\nbetween properties which the ordinary folk have put together in a\nparticular idea in fact holds in nature. Scientists are seeking to\nfind the necessary connections between properties. Still, even\nscientists, in Locke’s view, are restricted to using observable\n(and mainly secondary) qualities to categorize things in nature.\nSometimes, the scientists may find that the ordinary folk have erred,\nas when they called whales ‘fish’. A whale is not a fish,\nas it turns out, but a mammal. There is a characteristic group of\nqualities which fish have which whales do not have. There is a\ncharacteristic group of qualities which mammals have which whales also\nhave. To classify a whale as a fish therefore is a mistake. Similarly,\nwe might make an idea of gold that only included being a soft metal\nand gold color. If so, we would be unable to distinguish between gold\nand fool’s gold. Thus, since it is the mind that makes complex\nideas (they are ‘the workmanship of the understanding’),\none is free to put together any combination of ideas one wishes and\ncall it what one will. But the product of such work is open to\ncriticism, either on the grounds that it does not conform to already\ncurrent usage, or that it inadequately represents the archetypes that\nit is supposed to copy in the world. We engage in such criticism in\norder to improve human understanding of the material world and thus\nthe human condition. This is the convergent character of Locke’s\nconventionalism. In becoming more accurate the nominal essence is\nconverging on the real essence. \nThe distinction between modes and substances is surely one of the most\nimportant in Locke’s philosophy. In contrast with substances\nmodes are dependent existences—they can be thought of as the\nordering of substances. These are technical terms for Locke, so we\nshould see how they are defined. Locke writes:  \nFirst, Modes I call such complex Ideas, which\nhowever compounded, contain not in themselves the supposition of\nsubsisting by themselves; such are the ideas signified by the Words\nTriangle, Gratitude, Murther, etc. (II.12.4, N: 165)  \nLocke goes on to distinguish between simple and mixed modes. He\nwrites: \nOf these Modes, there are two sorts, which deserve distinct\nconsideration. First, there are some that are only variations, or\ndifferent combinations of the same simple Idea, without the\nmixture of any other, as a dozen or score; which are nothing but the\nideas of so many distinct unities being added together, and\nthese I call simple Modes, as being contained within the\nbounds of one simple Idea. Secondly, There are others,\ncompounded of Ideas of several kinds, put together to make\none complex one; v.g. Beauty, consisting of a certain\ncombination of Colour and Figure, causing Delight to the Beholder;\nTheft, which being the concealed change of the Possession of\nany thing, without the consent of the Proprietor, contains, as is\nvisible, a combination of several Ideas of several kinds; and\nthese I call Mixed Modes. (II.12.5, N: 165)  \nWhen we make ideas of modes, the mind is again active, but the\narchetype is in our mind. The question becomes whether things in the\nworld fit our ideas, and not whether our ideas correspond to the\nnature of things in the world. Our ideas are adequate. Thus we define\n‘bachelor’ as an unmarried, adult, male human being. If we\nfind that someone does not fit this definition, this does not reflect\nbadly on our definition, it simply means that that individual does not\nbelong to the class of bachelors. Modes give us the ideas of\nmathematics, of morality, of religion and politics and indeed of human\nconventions in general. Since these modal ideas are not only made by\nus but serve as standards that things in the world either fit or do\nnot fit and thus belong or do not belong to that sort, ideas of modes\nare clear and distinct, adequate and complete. Thus in modes, we get\nthe real and nominal essences combined. One can give precise\ndefinitions of mathematical terms (that is, give necessary and\nsufficient conditions) and one can give deductive demonstrations of\nmathematical truths. Locke sometimes says that morality too is capable\nof deductive demonstration. Though pressed by his friend William\nMolyneux to produce such a demonstrative morality, Locke never did so.\nThe entry\n Locke’s moral philosophy\n provides an excellent discussion of Locke’s views on morality\nand issues related to them for which there is no room in this general\naccount. The terms of political discourse also have some of the same\nmodal features for Locke. When Locke defines the states of nature,\nslavery and war in the Second Treatise of Government, for\nexample, we are presumably getting precise modal definitions from\nwhich one can deduce consequences. It is possible, however, that with\npolitics we are getting a study which requires both experience as well\nas the deductive modal aspect.  \nIn the fourth book of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke tells us what knowledge is and what humans can know and what\nthey cannot (not simply what they do and do not happen to know). Locke\ndefines knowledge as “the perception of the connexion and\nagreement or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our Ideas”\n(IV.1.1, N: 525). This definition of knowledge contrasts with the\nCartesian definition of knowledge as any ideas that are clear and\ndistinct. Locke’s account of knowledge allows him to say that we\ncan know substances in spite of the fact that our ideas of them always\ninclude the obscure and relative idea of substance in general. Still,\nLocke’s definition of knowledge raises in this domain a problem\nanalogous to those we have seen with perception and language. If\nknowledge is the “perception of … the agreement or\ndisagreement … of any of our Ideas”—are we not\ntrapped in the circle of our own ideas? What about knowing the real\nexistence of things? Locke is plainly aware of this problem, and very\nlikely holds that the implausibility of skeptical hypotheses, such as\nDescartes’ Dream hypothesis (he doesn’t even bother to\nmention Descartes’ malin genie or Evil Demon\nhypothesis), along with the causal connections between qualities and\nideas in his own system is enough to solve the problem. It is also\nworth noting that there are significant differences between\nLocke’s brand of empiricism and that of Berkeley that would make\nit easier for Locke to solve the veil of perception problem than\nBerkeley. Locke, for example, makes transdictive inferences about\natoms where Berkeley is unwilling to allow that such inferences are\nlegitimate. This implies that Locke has a semantics that allows him to\ntalk about the unexperienced causes of experience (such as atoms)\nwhere Berkeley cannot. (See Mackie’s perceptive discussion of\nthe veil of perception problem, in Problems from Locke, 1976:\n51 through 67.) \nWhat then can we know and with what degree of certainty? We can know\nthat God exists with the second highest degree of assurance, that of\ndemonstration. We also know that we exist with the highest degree of\ncertainty. The truths of morality and mathematics we can know with\ncertainty as well, because these are modal ideas whose adequacy is\nguaranteed by the fact that we make such ideas as ideal models which\nother things must fit, rather than trying to copy some external\narchetype which we can only grasp inadequately. On the other hand, our\nefforts to grasp the nature of external objects are limited largely to\nthe connection between their apparent qualities. The real essence of\nelephants and gold is hidden from us: though in general we suppose\nthem to be some distinct combination of atoms which cause the grouping\nof apparent qualities which leads us to see elephants and violets,\ngold and lead as distinct kinds. Our knowledge of material things is\nprobabilistic and thus opinion rather than knowledge. Thus our\n“knowledge” of external objects is inferior to our knowledge of mathematics and morality, of ourselves, and of God. We do\nhave sensitive knowledge of external objects, which is\nlimited to things we are presently experiencing. While Locke holds\nthat we only have knowledge of a limited number of things, he thinks\nwe can judge the truth or falsity of many propositions in addition to\nthose we can legitimately claim to know. This brings us to a\ndiscussion of probability. \nKnowledge involves the seeing of the agreement or disagreement of our\nideas. What then is probability and how does it relate to knowledge?\nLocke writes:  \nThe Understanding Faculties being given to Man, not barely for\nSpeculation, but also for the Conduct of his Life, Man would be at a\ngreat loss, if he had nothing to direct him, but what has the\nCertainty of true Knowledge… Therefore, as God has set\nsome Things in broad day-light; as he has given us some certain\nKnowledge…So in the greater part of our Concernment, he has\nafforded us only the twilight, as I may say so, of Probability,\nsuitable, I presume, to that State of Mediocrity and Probationership,\nhe has been pleased to place us in here, wherein to check our\nover-confidence and presumption, we might by every day’s\nExperience be made sensible of our short sightedness and liableness to\nError… (IV.14.1–2, N: 652)  \nSo, apart from the few important things that we can know for certain,\ne.g. the existence of ourselves and God, the nature of mathematics and\nmorality broadly construed, for the most part we must lead our lives\nwithout knowledge. What then is probability? Locke writes:  \nAs Demonstration is the shewing of the agreement or disagreement of\ntwo Ideas, by the intervention of one or more Proofs, which have a\nconstant, immutable, and visible connexion one with another: so\nProbability is nothing but the appearance of such an Agreement or\nDisagreement, by the intervention of Proofs, whose connection is not\nconstant and immutable, or at least is not perceived to be so, but is\nor appears, for the most part to be so, and is enough to induce the\nMind to judge the Proposition to be true, or false, rather than the\ncontrary. (IV.15.1, N: 654)  \nProbable reasoning, on this account, is an argument, similar in\ncertain ways to the demonstrative reasoning that produces knowledge\nbut different also in certain crucial respects. It is an argument that\nprovides evidence that leads the mind to judge a proposition true or\nfalse but without a guarantee that the judgment is correct. This kind\nof probable judgment comes in degrees, ranging from near\ndemonstrations and certainty to unlikeliness and improbability in the\nvicinity of impossibility. It is correlated with degrees of assent\nranging from full assurance down to conjecture, doubt and distrust.\n \nThe new science of mathematical probability had come into being on the\ncontinent just around the time that Locke was writing the\nEssay. His account of probability, however, shows little or\nno awareness of mathematical probability. Rather it reflects an older\ntradition that treated testimony as probable reasoning. Given that\nLocke’s aim, above all, is to discuss what degree of assent we\nshould give to various religious propositions, the older conception of\nprobability very likely serves his purposes best. Thus, when Locke\ncomes to describe the grounds for probability he cites the conformity\nof the proposition to our knowledge, observation and experience, and\nthe testimony of others who are reporting their observation and\nexperience. Concerning the latter we must consider the number of\nwitnesses, their integrity, their skill in observation, counter\ntestimony and so on. In judging rationally how much to assent to a\nprobable proposition, these are the relevant considerations that the\nmind should review. We should, Locke also suggests, be tolerant of\ndiffering opinions as we have more reason to retain the opinions we\nhave than to give them up to strangers or adversaries who may well\nhave some interest in our doing so. \nLocke distinguishes two sorts of probable propositions. The first of\nthese have to do with particular existences or matters of fact, and\nthe second that are beyond the testimony of the senses. Matters of\nfact are open to observation and experience, and so all of the tests\nnoted above for determining rational assent to propositions about them\nare available to us. Things are quite otherwise with matters that are\nbeyond the testimony of the senses. These include the knowledge of\nfinite immaterial spirits such as angels or things such as atoms that\nare too small to be sensed, or the plants, animals or inhabitants of\nother planets that are beyond our range of sensation because of their\ndistance from us. Concerning this latter category, Locke says we must\ndepend on analogy as the only help for our reasoning. He writes:  \nThus the observing that the bare rubbing of two bodies violently one\nupon the other, produce heat, and very often fire it self, we have\nreason to think, that what we call Heat and Fire consist of the\nviolent agitation of the imperceptible minute parts of the burning\nmatter…. (IV.16.12, N: 665–6)  \nWe reason about angels by considering the Great Chain of Being;\nfiguring that while we have no experience of angels, the ranks of\nspecies above us is likely as numerous as that below of which we do\nhave experience. This reasoning is, however, only probable. \nThe relative merits of the senses, reason and faith for attaining\ntruth and the guidance of life were a significant issue during this\nperiod. As noted above James Tyrrell recalled that the original\nimpetus for the writing of An Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding was a discussion about the principles of morality\nand revealed religion. In Book IV Chapters 17, 18, and 19 Locke deals\nwith the nature of reason, the relation of reason to faith and the\nnature of enthusiasm. Locke remarks that all sects make use of reason\nas far as they can. It is only when this fails them that they have\nrecourse to faith and claim that what is revealed is above reason. But\nhe adds:  \nAnd I do not see how they can argue with anyone or even convince a\ngainsayer who uses the same plea, without setting down strict\nboundaries between faith and reason. (IV.18.2, N: 689)  \nLocke then defines reason as  \nthe discovery of the certainty or probability of such propositions or\ntruths, which the mind arrives at by deduction made from such ideas,\nas it has got by the use of its natural faculties; viz, by the use of\nsensation or reflection. (IV.18.2, N: 689)  \nFaith, on the other hand, is assent to any proposition\n“…upon the credit of the proposer, as coming from God, in\nsome extraordinary way of communication”. That is we have faith\nin what is disclosed by revelation and which cannot be discovered by\nreason. Locke also distinguishes between the original\nrevelation by God to some person, and traditional\nrevelation which is the original revelation\n“…delivered over to others in Words, and the ordinary\nways of our conveying our Conceptions one to another” (IV.18.3,\nN: 690).  \nLocke makes the point that some things could be discovered both by\nreason and by revelation—God could reveal the propositions of\nEuclid’s geometry, or they could be discovered by reason. In\nsuch cases there would be little use for faith. Traditional revelation\ncan never produce as much certainty as the contemplation of the\nagreement or disagreement of our own ideas. Similarly revelations\nabout matters of fact do not produce as much certainty as having the\nexperience oneself. Revelation, then, cannot contradict what we know\nto be true. If it could, it would undermine the trustworthiness of all\nof our faculties. This would be a disastrous result. Where revelation\ncomes into its own is where reason cannot reach. Where we have few or\nno ideas for reason to contradict or confirm, these are the proper\nmatters for faith.  \n…that Part of the Angels rebelled against GOD, and thereby lost\ntheir first happy state: and that the dead shall rise, and live again:\nThese and the like, being Beyond the Discovery of Reason, are purely\nmatters of Faith; with which Reason has nothing to do. (IV.18.8, N:\n694)  \nStill, reason does have a crucial role to play in respect to\nrevelation. Locke writes: \nBecause the Mind, not being certain of the Truth of that it evidently\ndoes not know, but only yielding to the Probability that appears to\nit, is bound to give up its assent to such Testimony, which, it is\nsatisfied, comes from one who cannot err, and will not deceive. But\nyet, it still belongs to Reason, to judge of the truth of its being a\nRevelation, and of the significance of the Words, wherein it is\ndelivered. (IV.18.8, N: 694)  \nSo, in respect to the crucial question of how we are to know whether a\nrevelation is genuine, we are supposed to use reason and the canons of\nprobability to judge. Locke claims that if the boundaries between\nfaith and reason are not clearly marked, then there will be no place\nfor reason in religion and one then gets all the “extravagant\nOpinions and Ceremonies, that are to be found in the religions of the\nworld…” (IV.18.11, N: 696).  \nShould one accept revelation without using reason to judge whether it\nis genuine revelation or not, one gets what Locke calls a third\nprinciple of assent besides reason and revelation, namely enthusiasm.\nEnthusiasm is a vain or unfounded confidence in divine favor or\ncommunication. It implies that there is no need to use reason to judge\nwhether such favor or communication is genuine or not. Clearly when\nsuch communications are not genuine they are “the ungrounded\nFancies of a Man’s own Brain” (IV.19.2, N: 698). This kind\nof enthusiasm was characteristic of Protestant extremists going back\nto the era of the civil war. Locke was not alone in rejecting\nenthusiasm, but he rejects it in the strongest terms. Enthusiasm\nviolates the fundamental principle by which the understanding\noperates—that assent be proportioned to the evidence. To abandon\nthat fundamental principle would be catastrophic. This is a point that\nLocke also makes in The Conduct of the Understanding and\nThe Reasonableness of Christianity. Locke wants each of us to\nuse our understanding to search after truth. Of enthusiasts, those who\nwould abandon reason and claim to know on the basis of faith alone,\nLocke writes:  \n…he that takes away Reason to make way for Revelation, puts out\nthe Light of both, and does much what the same, as if he would\nperswade a Man to put out his eyes, the better to receive the remote\nLight of an invisible Star by a Telescope. (IV.19.4, N: 698)  \nRather than engage in the tedious labor required to reason correctly to judge of the genuineness of their revelation, enthusiasts persuade themselves that they are possessed of immediate revelation. This leads to “odd Opinions and extravagant\nactions” that are characteristic of enthusiasm and which should\nwarn that this is a wrong principle. Thus, Locke strongly rejects any\nattempt to make inward persuasion not judged by reason a legitimate\nprinciple. \nWe turn now to a consideration of Locke’s educational works.\n \nLocke’s Some Thoughts Concerning Education and his\nConduct of the Understanding form a nice bridge between\nAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding and his political\nworks. Ruth Grant and Nathan Tarcov write in the introduction to their\nedition of these works:  \nThe idea of liberty, so crucial to all of Locke’s writings on\npolitics and education, is traced in the Essay to reflection on the\npower of the mind over one’s own actions, especially the power\nto suspend actions in the pursuit of the satisfaction of one’s\nown desires until after a full consideration of their objects\n(II.21.47, N: 51–52). The Essay thus shows how the independence\nof mind pursued in the Conduct is possible. (G&T 1996:\nxvi)  \nSome Thoughts Concerning Education was first published in\n1693. This book collected together advice that Locke had been giving\nhis friend Edward Clarke about the education of Clarke’s son\n(and also his daughters) since 1684. In preparing the revision for the\nfourth edition of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\nLocke began writing a chapter called “The Conduct of the\nUnderstanding”. This became quite long and was never added to\nthe Essay or even finished. It was left to Locke’s\nliterary executors to decide what to do with it. The Conduct\nwas published by Peter King in his posthumous edition of some of\nLocke’s works in 1706. As Locke was composing these works, some\nof the material from the Conduct eventually made its way into\nthe Thoughts. Grant and Tarcov write that the\nThoughts and the Conduct “complement each\nother well: the Thoughts focuses on the education of children by their\nparents, whereas the Conduct addresses the self-education of\nadults” (G&T 1996: vii). Though they also note tensions\nbetween the two that illustrate paradoxes in liberal society. The\nThoughts is addressed to the education of the sons and\ndaughters of the English gentry in the late seventeenth century. It is\nin some ways thus significantly more limited to its time and place\nthan the Conduct. Yet, its insistence on the inculcating such\nvirtues as  \njustice as respect for the rights of others, civility, liberality,\nhumanity, self-denial, industry, thrift, courage, truthfulness, and a\nwillingness to question prejudice, authority and the biases of\none’s own self-interest  \nvery likely represents the qualities needed for citizens in a liberal\nsociety (G&T 1996: xiii). \nLocke’s Thoughts represents the culmination of a\ncentury of what has been called “the discovery of the\nchild”. In the Middle Ages the child was regarded as  \nonly a simple plaything, as a simple animal, or a miniature adult who\ndressed, played and was supposed to act like his elders…Their\nages were unimportant and therefore seldom known. Their education was\nundifferentiated, either by age, ability or intended occupation.\n(Axtell 1968: 63–4)  \nLocke treated children as human beings in whom the gradual development\nof rationality needed to be fostered by parents. Locke urged parents\nto spend time with their children and tailor their education to their\ncharacter and idiosyncrasies, to develop both a sound body and\ncharacter, and to make play the chief strategy for learning rather\nthan rote learning or punishment. Thus, he urged learning languages by\nlearning to converse in them before learning rules of grammar. Locke\nalso suggests that the child learn at least one manual trade.  \nIn advocating a kind of education that made people who think for\nthemselves, Locke was preparing people to effectively make decisions\nin their own lives—to engage in individual\nself-government—and to participate in the government of their\ncountry. The Conduct reveals the connections Locke sees\nbetween reason, freedom and morality. Reason is required for good\nself-government because reason insofar as it is free from partiality,\nintolerance and passion and able to question authority leads to fair\njudgment and action. We thus have a responsibility to cultivate reason\nin order to avoid the moral failings of passion, partiality and so\nforth (G&T 1996: xii). This is, in Tarcov’s phrase,\nLocke’s education for liberty.  \nWe turn now to Locke’s political writings. (See the entry on\n Locke’s political philosophy,\n which focuses on five topics (the state of nature, natural law,\nproperty, consent and toleration) and goes into these topics in more\ndepth than is possible in a general account and provides much useful\ninformation on the debates about them.) \nLord Shaftsbury had been dismissed from his post as Lord Chancellor in 1673 and had become one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Country Party.  In 1679 the chief issue was the attempt by the Country Party leaders to exclude James, Duke of York from succeeding his brother Charles II to the throne.  They wanted to do this because James was a Catholic, and England by this time was a firmly Protestant country. They had acquired a majority in the House of Commons through serious grass roots election campaigns, and passed an exclusion bill, but given the King’s unwillingness to see his brother excluded from the throne, the bill failed in the House of Lords.  They tried a couple of more times without success.  Having failed by parliamentary means, some of the Country Party leaders started plotting armed rebellion. The Two Treatises of Government were published in 1688, long after the rebellion plotted by the Country party leaders had failed to materialize and after Shaftsbury had fled the country for Holland and died. The introduction of the Two Treatises was written after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and gave the impression that the book was written to justify the Glorious Revolution. We now know that the Two Treatises of Government were written during the Exclusion crisis in 1681 and may have been intended in part to justify the general armed rising which the Country Party leaders were planning.  \n\nThere were serious obstacles to a rebellion to force James’ exclusion\nfrom the throne.  The English Anglican gentry needed to support such\nan action.  But the Anglican church from childhood on taught that:\n“…men’s political duties were exhaustively determined by their\nterrestrial superiors, that under grave conscientious scruples they\nmight rightly decline to carry out those decrees of authority which\nwere in direct breach of divine law, they could under no circumstances\nhave a right to resist such authority”. (Dunn, 1968, 48) Since by 1679\nit was abundantly clear that the King opposed excluding his brother\nfrom the throne, to favor exclusion implied “explicit and\nself-conscious resistance to the sovereign”.  Passive resistance would\nsimply not do.  On the other hand, the royal policy “outraged their\ndeepest religious prejudices and stimulated their most obscure\nemotional anxieties.”  So, the gentry were deeply conflicted and\nneither of the choices available to them looked very palatable.  John\nDunn goes on to remark: “To exert influence upon their choice it\nwas above all necessary to present a more coherent ordering of their\nvalues, to show that the political tradition within which the\ndissenters saw their conduct was not necessarily empirically absurd or\nsocially subversive.  The gentry had to be persuaded that there could\nbe reason for rebellion which could make it neither blasphemous or\nsuicidal.” (Dunn, 1968, 49)\n\nTo achieve this goal Locke picked the most relevant and extreme of the supporters of the divine right of Kings to attack.  Sir Robert Filmer (c 1588–1653), a man of the generation of Charles I and the English Civil War, who had defended the crown in various works.  His most famous work, however, Patriarcha, was published posthumously in 1680 and represented the most complete and coherent exposition of the view Locke wished to deny. Filmer held that men were born into helpless servitude to an authoritarian family, a social hierarchy and a sovereign whose only constraint was his relationship with God.  Under these circumstances, anything other than passive obedience would be “vicious, blasphemous and intellectually absurd.” So, Locke needed to refute Filmer and in Dunn’s words: “rescue the contractarian account of political obligation from the criticism of impiety and absurdity. Only in this way could he restore to the Anglican gentry a coherent basis for moral autonomy or a practical initiative in the field of politics.” (Dunn, 1968, 50) \n  \nThe First Treatise of Government is a polemical work aimed at\nrefuting the theological basis for the patriarchal version of the Divine Right of Kings doctrine put forth by Sir Robert Filmer. Locke singles out Filmer’s\ncontention that men are not “naturally free” as the key issue, for that is the “ground” or premise on which Filmer erects his argument for the claim that all “legitimate”\ngovernment is “absolute monarchy”—kings being descended from the first man, Adam, and their subjects being naturally slaves. Early in the First Treatise Locke denies that either\nscripture or reason supports Filmer’s premise or arguments. In\nwhat follows in the First Treatise, Locke minutely examines\nkey Biblical passages. \nWhile The Second Treatise of Government provides\nLocke’s positive theory of government, it also continues his\nargument against Sir Robert Filmer’s claims that monarchs\nlegitimately hold absolute power over their subjects. Locke holds that\nFilmer’s view is sufficiently incoherent to lead to governments\nbeing established by force and violence. Thus, Locke claims he must\nprovide an alternative account of the origin of government “lest\nmen fall into the dangerous belief that all government in the world is\nmerely the product of force and violence” (Treatises II,1,4). Locke’s account involves several devices which were common in seventeenth and eighteenth century political philosophy—natural rights theory and the social contract. Natural rights are those rights which we are\nsupposed to have as human beings before ever government comes into\nbeing. We might suppose, that like other animals, we have a natural\nright to struggle for our survival. Locke will argue that we have a\nright to the means to survive. When Locke comes to explain how\ngovernment comes into being, he uses the idea that people agree that\ntheir condition in the state of nature is unsatisfactory, and so agree\nto transfer some of their rights to a central government, while\nretaining others. This is the theory of the social contract. There are\nmany versions of natural rights theory and the social contract in\nseventeenth and eighteenth century European political philosophy, some\nconservative and some radical. Locke’s version belongs on the\nradical side of the spectrum. These radical natural right theories\ninfluenced the ideologies of the American and French revolutions. \nLocke’s strategy for refuting Filmer’s claims that monarchs have absolute power over their subjects is to show that\nFilmer is conflating a whole variety of limited powers, all of which\nmight be held by one man and thus give the false appearance that\na king has absolute power over wives, children, servants and slaves as\nwell as subjects of a commonwealth. When properly distinguished,\nhowever, and the limitations of each displayed, it becomes clear that\nmonarchs have no legitimate absolute power over their subjects.  \nAn important part of Locke’s project in the Second\nTreatise is to figure out what the role of legitimate government\nis, thus allowing him to distinguish the nature of illegitimate\ngovernment. Once this is done, the basis for legitimate revolution\nbecomes clear. Figuring out what the proper or legitimate role of\ncivil government is would be a difficult task indeed if one were to\nexamine the vast complexity of existing governments. How should one\nproceed? One strategy is to consider what life is like in the absence\nof civil government. Presumably this is a simpler state, one which may\nbe easier to understand. Then one might see what role civil government\nought to play. This is the strategy which Locke pursues, following\nHobbes and others. So, in the first chapter of the Second\nTreatise Locke defines political power.  \nPolitical power, then, I take to be a right of\nmaking laws with penalties of death, and consequently all less\npenalties, for the regulating and preserving of property, and of\nemploying the force of the community, in the execution of such laws,\nand in the defence of the common-wealth from foreign injury; and all\nthis only for the public good. (Treatises, II, 1,3) \nIn the second chapter of The Second Treatise Locke describes\nthe state in which there is no government with real political power.\nThis is the state of nature. It is sometimes assumed that the state of\nnature is a state in which there is no government at all. This is only\npartially true. It is possible to have in the state of nature either\nno government, illegitimate government, or legitimate government with\nless than full political power. (See the section on the\n state of nature\n in the entry on Locke’s political philosophy.) \nIf we consider the state of nature before there was government, it is\na state of political equality in which there is no natural superior or\ninferior. From this equality flows the obligation to mutual love and\nthe duties that people owe one another, and the great maxims of\njustice and charity. Was there ever such a state? There has been\nconsiderable debate about this. Still, it is plain that both Hobbes\nand Locke would answer this question affirmatively. Whenever people\nhave not agreed to establish a common political authority, they remain\nin the state of nature. It’s like saying that people are in the\nstate of being naturally single until they are married. Locke clearly\nthinks one can find the state of nature in his time at least in the\n“inland, vacant places of America” (Second\nTreatise V. 36) and in the relations between different peoples.\nPerhaps the historical development of states also went though the\nstages of a state of nature. An alternative possibility is that the\nstate of nature is not a real historical state, but rather a\ntheoretical construct, intended to help determine the proper function\nof government. If one rejects the historicity of states of nature, one\nmay still find them a useful analytical device. For Locke, it is very\nlikely both. \nAccording to Locke, God created man and we are, in effect, God’s\nproperty. The chief end set us by our creator as a species and as\nindividuals is survival. A wise and omnipotent God, having made people\nand sent them into this world:  \n…by his order and about his business, they are his property\nwhose workmanship they are, made to last during his, not one\nanother’s pleasure: and being furnished with like faculties,\nsharing all in one community of nature, there cannot be supposed any\nsubordination among us, that may authorize us to destroy one another,\nas if we were made for one another’s uses, as the inferior ranks\nof creatures are for our’s. (Treatises II,2,6) \nIt follows immediately that “he has no liberty to destroy\nhimself, or so much as any creature in his possession, yet when some\nnobler use than its bare possession calls for it”\n(Treatises II.2.6). So, murder and suicide violate the divine\npurpose.  \nIf one takes survival as the end, then we may ask what are the means\nnecessary to that end. On Locke’s account, these turn out to be\nlife, liberty, health and property. Since the end is set by God, on\nLocke’s view we have a right to the means to that end. So we\nhave rights to life, liberty, health and property. These are natural\nrights, that is they are rights that we have in a state of nature\nbefore the introduction of civil government, and all people have these\nrights equally. \nThere is also a law of nature. It is the Golden Rule, interpreted in\nterms of natural rights. Thus Locke writes:  \nThe state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges\neveryone: and reason which is that law, teaches all mankind who will\nbut consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to\nharm another in his life, health, liberty or possessions….\n(Treatises II.2.6)  \nLocke tells us that the law of nature is revealed by reason. Locke\nmakes the point about the law that it commands what is best for us. If\nit did not, he says, the law would vanish for it would not be obeyed.\nIt is in this sense that Locke means that reason reveals the law. If\nyou reflect on what is best for yourself and others, given the goal of\nsurvival and our natural equality, you will come to this conclusion.\n(See the section on\n the law of nature\n in the entry on Locke’s Political Philosophy.) \nLocke does not intend his account of the state of nature as a sort of\nutopia. Rather it serves as an analytical device that explains why it\nbecomes necessary to introduce civil government and what the\nlegitimate function of civil government is. Thus, as Locke conceives\nit, there are problems with life in the state of nature. The law of\nnature, like civil laws can be violated. There are no police,\nprosecutors or judges in the state of nature as these are all\nrepresentatives of a government with full political power. The\nvictims, then, must enforce the law of nature in the state of nature.\nIn addition to our other rights in the state of nature, we have the\nrights to enforce the law and to judge on our own behalf. We may,\nLocke tells us, help one another. We may intervene in cases where our\nown interests are not directly under threat to help enforce the law of\nnature. This right eventually serves as the justification for legitimate rebellion. \nStill, in the state of nature, the person who is most likely to enforce the law under these circumstances is the person who has been wronged. The basic principle of justice is\nthat the punishment should be proportionate to the crime. But when the\nvictims are judging the seriousness of the crime, they are more likely\nto judge it of greater severity than might an impartial judge. As a\nresult, there will be regular miscarriages of justice. This is perhaps\nthe most important problem with the state of nature. \nIn chapters 3 and 4, Locke defines the states of war and slavery. The\nstate of war is a state in which someone has a sedate and settled\nintention of violating someone’s right to life (and thus all their other rights). Such a person puts themselves into a state of war with the person whose life they intend to take. In such a war the person who intends to violate\nsomeone’s right to life is an unjust aggressor. This is not the\nnormal relationship between people enjoined by the law of nature in\nthe state of nature. Locke is distancing himself from Hobbes who had\nmade the state of nature and the state of war equivalent terms. For\nLocke, the state of nature is ordinarily one in which we follow the\nGolden Rule interpreted in terms of natural rights, and thus love our\nfellow human creatures. The state of war only comes about when someone\nproposes to violate someone else’s rights. Thus, on\nLocke’s theory of war, there will always be an innocent victim\non one side and an unjust aggressor on the other. \nSlavery is the state of being in the absolute or arbitrary power of\nanother. On Locke’s definition of slavery there is only one\nrather remarkable way to become a legitimate slave. In order to do so\none must be an unjust aggressor defeated in war. The just victor then\nhas the option to either kill the aggressor or enslave them. Locke\ntells us that the state of slavery is the continuation of the state of\nwar between a lawful conqueror and a captive, in which the conqueror\ndelays to take the life of the captive, and instead makes use of him.\nThis is a continued war because if conqueror and captive make some\ncompact for obedience on the one side and limited power on the other,\nthe state of slavery ceases and becomes a relation between a master\nand a servant in which the master only has limited power over his\nservant. The reason that slavery ceases with the compact is that\n“no man, can, by agreement pass over to another that which he\nhath not in himself, a power over his own life”\n(Treatises II.4.24). Legitimate slavery is an important\nconcept in Locke’s political philosophy largely because it tells\nus what the legitimate extent of despotic power is and defines and\nilluminates by contrast the nature of illegitimate slavery.\nIllegitimate slavery is that state in which someone possesses absolute\nor despotic power over someone else without just cause. Locke holds\nthat it is this illegitimate state of slavery which absolute monarchs\nwish to impose upon their subjects. It is very likely for this reason\nthat legitimate slavery is so narrowly defined. This shows that the\nchapter on slavery plays a crucial role in Locke’s argument\nagainst Sir Robert Filmer and thus could not have been easily\ndispensed with. Still, it is possible that Locke had an additional\npurpose or perhaps a quite different reason for writing about\nslavery. \nThere have been a steady stream of articles over the last forty years\narguing that given Locke’s involvement with trade and colonial\ngovernment, the theory of slavery in the Second Treatise was\nintended to justify the institutions and practices of Afro-American\nslavery. If this were the case, Locke’s philosophy would not\ncontradict his actions as an investor and colonial administrator.\nHowever, there are strong objections to this view. Had he intended to\njustify Afro-American slavery, Locke would have done much better with\na vastly more inclusive definition of legitimate slavery than the one\nhe gives. It is sometimes suggested that Locke’s account of\n“just war” is so vague that it could easily be twisted to justify the institutions and practices of Afro-American slavery. This,\nhowever, is also not the case. In the chapter “Of\nConquest” Locke explicitly lists the limits of the legitimate\npower of conquerors. These limits on who can become a legitimate slave\nand what the powers of a just conqueror are ensure that this theory of\nconquest and slavery would condemn the institutions and practices of\nAfro-American slavery in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth\ncenturies. Nonetheless, the debate continues. One element of the\ndebate has to do with Locke’s role in the writing of the\nFundamental Constitutions of the Carolinas. David Armitage in\nhis 2004 article “John Locke, Carolina and the Two Treatises of\nGovernment” argues that Locke was involved in a revision of the\nFundamental Constitution of the Carolinas at the very time he\nwas writing The Two Treatises of Government. The provision\nthat “Every Freedman of the Carolinas has absolute power and\nauthority over his negro slaves” remained in the document\nunchanged. In his 2016 book The Ashley Cooper Plan Thomas\nWilson gives a detailed account of Ashley Cooper’s intentions\nfor the Carolina colony and how Cooper’s intent was thwarted by\nBarbadian slave owners who changed Carolina society from a society\nwith slaves to a slave society. James Farr’s article\n“Locke, Natural Law and New World Slavery” (2008) is one of the best statements of the position that Locke intended his\ntheory of slavery to apply to English absolutism and not Afro-American\nslavery, while noting that Locke’s involvement with slavery has\nruined his reputation as the great champion of liberty (see also\nUzgalis 2017). Roger Woolhouse in his recent biography of Locke\n(Woolhouse 2007: 187) remarks that “Though there is no consensus\non the whole question, there certainly seems to be ‘a glaring\ncontradiction between his theories and Afro-American\nslavery’”. \nChapter 5 “Of Property” is one of the most famous,\ninfluential and important chapters in the Second Treatise of\nGovernment. Indeed, some of the most controversial issues about\nthe Second Treatise come from varying interpretations of it.\nIn this chapter Locke, in effect, describes the evolution of the state\nof nature to the point where it becomes expedient for those in it to\nfound a civil government. So, it is not only an account of the nature\nand origin of private property, but leads up to the explanation of why\ncivil government replaces the state of nature (see the section on\n property\n in the entry on Locke’s political philosophy). \nIn discussing the origin of private property Locke begins by noting\nthat God gave the earth to all men in common. Thus there is a question\nabout how private property comes to be. Locke finds it a serious\ndifficulty. He points out, however, that we are supposed to make use\nof the earth “for the best advantage of life and\nconvenience” (Treatises II.5.25). What then is the\nmeans to appropriate property from the common store? Locke argues that\nprivate property does not come about by universal consent. If one had\nto go about and ask everyone if one could eat these berries, one would\nstarve to death before getting everyone’s agreement. Locke holds\nthat we have a property in our own person. And the labor of our body\nand the work of our hands properly belong to us. So, when one picks up\nacorns or berries, they thereby belong to the person who picked them\nup. There has been some controversy about what Locke means by\n“labor”. Daniel Russell claims that for Locke, labor is a\ngoal-directed activity that converts materials that might meet our\nneeds into resources that actually do (Russell 2004). This\ninterpretation of what Locke means by “labor” connects\nnicely with his claim that we have a natural law obligation first to\npreserve ourselves and then to help in the preservation and\nflourishing of others. \nOne might think that one could then acquire as much as one wished, but\nthis is not the case. Locke introduces at least two important\nqualifications on how much property can be acquired. The first\nqualification has to do with waste. Locke writes:  \nAs much as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it\nspoils, so much by his labor he may fix a property in; whatever is\nbeyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others.\n(Treatises II.5.31)  \nSince originally, populations were small and resources great, living\nwithin the bounds set by reason, there would be little quarrel or\ncontention over property, for a single man could make use of only a\nvery small part of what was available. \nNote that Locke has, thus far, been talking about hunting and\ngathering, and the kinds of limitations which reason imposes on the\nkind of property that hunters and gatherers hold. In the next section\nhe turns to agriculture and the ownership of land and the kinds of\nlimitations there are on that kind of property. In effect, we see the\nevolution of the state of nature from a hunter/gatherer kind of\nsociety to that of a farming and agricultural society. Once again it\nis labor which imposes limitations upon how much land can be enclosed.\nIt is only as much as one can work. But there is an additional\nqualification. Locke says: \nNor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by\nimproving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still\nenough, and as good left; and more than the as yet unprovided could\nuse. So that, in effect, there was never the less for others because\nof his inclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another\ncan make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could\nconsider himself injured by the drinking of another man, though he\ntook a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left to\nquench his thirst: and the case of land and water, where there is\nenough, is perfectly the same. (Treatises II.5.33)  \nThe next stage in the evolution of the state of nature involves the\nintroduction of money. Locke remarks that:  \n… before the desire of having more than one needed had altered\nthe intrinsic value of things, which depends only on their usefulness\nto the life of man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow\nmetal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be worth a\ngreat piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn; though men had a right\nto appropriate by their labor, each one of himself, as much of the\nthings of nature, as he could use; yet this could not be much, nor to\nthe prejudice of others, where the same plenty was left to those who\nwould use the same industry. (Treatises II.5.37)  \nSo, before the introduction of money, there was a degree of economic\nequality imposed on mankind both by reason and the barter system. And\nmen were largely confined to the satisfaction of their needs and\nconveniences. Most of the necessities of life are relatively short\nlived—berries, plums, venison and so forth. One could reasonably\nbarter one’s berries for nuts which would last not weeks but\nperhaps a whole year. And says Locke:  \n…if he would give his nuts for a piece of metal, pleased with\nits color, or exchange his sheep for shells, or wool for a sparkling\npebble or diamond, and keep those by him all his life, he invaded not\nthe right of others, he might heap up as much of these durable things\nas he pleased; the exceeding of the bounds of his property not lying\nin the largeness of his possessions, but the perishing of anything\nuselessly in it. (Treatises II.5.146)  \nThe introduction of money is necessary for the differential increase\nin property, with resulting economic inequality. Without money there\nwould be no point in going beyond the economic equality of the earlier\nstage. In a money economy, different degrees of industry could give\nmen vastly different proportions.  \nThis partage of things in an inequality of private possessions, men\nhave made practicable out of the bounds of society, and without\ncompact, only by putting a value on gold and silver, and tacitly\nagreeing to the use of money: for in governments, the laws regulate\nthe rights of property, and the possession of land is determined by\npositive constitutions. (Treatises II.5.50)  \nThe implication is that it is the introduction of money, which causes\ninequality, which in turn multiplies the causes of quarrels and\ncontentions and increased numbers of violations of the law of nature.\nThis leads to the decision to create a civil government. Before\nturning to the institution of civil government, however, we should ask\nwhat happens to the qualifications on the acquisition of property\nafter the advent of money? One answer proposed by C. B. Macpherson in The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism is that the qualifications are completely set aside, and we now have a system for the unlimited acquisition of private property. This does\nnot seem to be correct. It seems plain, rather, that at least the\nnon-spoilage qualification is satisfied, because money does not spoil.\nThe other qualifications may be rendered somewhat irrelevant by the\nadvent of the conventions about property adopted in civil society.\nThis leaves open the question of whether Locke approved of these\nchanges. Macpherson, who takes Locke to be a spokesman for a\nproto-capitalist system, sees Locke as advocating the unlimited\nacquisition of wealth. James Tully, on the other side, in A Discourse of Property\nholds that Locke sees the new conditions, the change in values and the economic\ninequality which arise as a result of the advent of money, as the fall\nof man. Tully sees Locke as a persistent and powerful critic of\nself-interest. This remarkable difference in interpretation has been a\nsignificant topic for debates among scholars over the last forty\nyears. Though the Second Treatise of Government may leave\nthis question difficult to determine, one might consider Locke’s\nremark in Some Thoughts Concerning Education that  \nCovetousness and the desire to having in our possession and our\ndominion more than we have need of, being the root of all evil, should\nbe early and carefully weeded out and the contrary quality of being\nready to impart to others inculcated. (G&T 1996: 81)  \nLet us then turn to the institution of civil government.  \nJust as natural rights and natural law theory had a florescence in the\nseventeenth and eighteenth century, so did the social contract theory.\nWhy is Locke a social contract theorist? Is it merely that this was\none prevailing way of thinking about government at the time which\nLocke blindly adopted? The answer is that there is something about\nLocke’s project which pushes him strongly in the direction of\nthe social contract. One might hold that governments were originally\ninstituted by force, and that no agreement was involved. Were Locke to\nadopt this view, he would be forced to go back on many of the things\nwhich are at the heart of his project in the Second Treatise,\nthough cases like the Norman conquest force him to admit that citizens\nmay come to accept a government that was originally forced on them.\nRemember that the Second Treatise provides Locke’s\npositive theory of government, and that he explicitly says that he\nmust provide an alternative to the view  \nthat all government in the world is merely the product of force and\nviolence, and that men live together by no other rules than that of\nthe beasts, where the strongest carries it …\n. (Treatises II, 1, 4)  \nSo, while Locke might admit that some governments come about through\nforce or violence, he would be destroying the most central and vital\ndistinction, that between legitimate and illegitimate civil\ngovernment, if he admitted that legitimate government can come about\nin this way. So, for Locke, legitimate government is instituted by the\nexplicit consent of those governed. (See the section on\n consent, political obligation, and the ends of government\n in the entry on Locke’s political philosophy.) Those who make\nthis agreement transfer to the government their right of executing the\nlaw of nature and judging their own case. These are the powers which\nthey give to the central government, and this is what makes the\njustice system of governments a legitimate function of such\ngovernments.  \nRuth Grant has persuasively argued that the establishment of\ngovernment is in effect a two step process. Universal consent is\nnecessary to form a political community. Consent to join a community\nonce given is binding and cannot be withdrawn. This makes political\ncommunities stable. Grant writes: “Having established that the\nmembership in a community entails the obligation to abide by the will\nof the community, the question remains: Who rules?” (1987:\n114–115). The answer to this question is determined by majority\nrule. The point is that universal consent is necessary to establish a\npolitical community, majority consent to answer the question who is to\nrule such a community. Universal consent and majority consent are thus\ndifferent in kind, not just in degree. Grant writes: \nLocke’s argument for the right of the majority is the\ntheoretical ground for the distinction between duty to society and\nduty to government, the distinction that permits an argument for\nresistance without anarchy. When the designated government dissolves,\nmen remain obligated to society acting through majority rule. (1987:\n119)  \nIt is entirely possible for the majority to confer the rule of the\ncommunity on a king and his heirs, or a group of oligarchs or on a\ndemocratic assembly. Thus, the social contract is not inextricably\nlinked to democracy. Still, a government of any kind must perform the\nlegitimate function of a civil government.  \nLocke is now in a position to explain the function of a legitimate\ngovernment and distinguish it from illegitimate government. The aim of\nsuch a legitimate government is to preserve, so far as possible, the\nrights to life, liberty, health and property of its citizens, and to\nprosecute and punish those of its citizens who violate the rights of\nothers and to pursue the public good even where this may conflict with\nthe rights of individuals. In doing this it provides something\nunavailable in the state of nature, an impartial judge to determine\nthe severity of the crime, and to set a punishment proportionate to\nthe crime. This is one of the main reasons why civil society is an\nimprovement on the state of nature. An illegitimate government will\nfail to protect the rights to life, liberty, health and property of\nits subjects, and in the worst cases, such an illegitimate government\nwill claim to be able to violate the rights of its subjects, that is\nit will claim to have despotic power over its subjects. Since Locke is\narguing against the position of Sir Robert Filmer who held that\npatriarchal power and political power are the same, and that in effect\nthese amount to despotic power, Locke is at pains to distinguish these\nthree forms of power, and to show that they are not equivalent. Thus\nat the beginning of chapter 15 “Of Paternal, Political and\nDespotic Power Considered Together” he writes:  \nTHOUGH I have had occasion to speak of these before, yet the great\nmistakes of late about government, having as I suppose arisen from\nconfounding these distinct powers one with another, it may not be\namiss, to consider them together.  \nChapters 6 and 7 give Locke’s account of paternal and political\npower respectively. Paternal power is limited. It lasts only through\nthe minority of children, and has other limitations. Political power,\nderived as it is from the transfer of the power of individuals to\nenforce the law of nature, has with it the right to kill in the\ninterest of preserving the rights of the citizens or otherwise\nsupporting the public good. Legitimate despotic power, by contrast,\nimplies the right to take the life, liberty, health and at least some\nof the property of any person subject to such a power.  \nAt the end of the Second Treatise we learn about the nature\nof illegitimate civil governments and the conditions under which\nrebellion and regicide are legitimate and appropriate. As noted above,\nscholars now hold that the book was written during the Exclusion\ncrisis, and may have been written to justify a general insurrection\nand the assassination of the king of England and his brother. The\nargument for legitimate revolution follows from making the distinction\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate civil government. A legitimate\ncivil government seeks to preserve the life, health, liberty and\nproperty of its subjects, insofar as this is compatible with the\npublic good. Because it does this it deserves obedience. An\nillegitimate civil government seeks to systematically violate the\nnatural rights of its subjects. It seeks to make them illegitimate\nslaves. Because an illegitimate civil government does this, it puts\nitself in a state of nature and a state of war with its subjects. The\nmagistrate or king of such a state violates the law of nature and so\nmakes himself into a dangerous beast of prey who operates on the\nprinciple that might makes right, or that the strongest carries it. In\nsuch circumstances, rebellion is legitimate as is the killing of such\na dangerous beast of prey. Thus Locke justifies rebellion and regicide\nunder certain circumstances. Presumably this justification was going\nto be offered for the killing of the King of England and his brother\nhad the Rye House Plot succeeded. Even if this was not Locke’s\nintention, it still would have served that purpose admirably. \nThe issue of religious toleration was of widespread interest in Europe\nin the seventeenth century. The Reformation had split Europe into\ncompeting religious camps, and this provoked civil wars and massive\nreligious persecutions. The Dutch Republic, where Locke spent time,\nhad been founded as a secular state which would allow religious\ndifferences. This was a reaction to Catholic persecution of\nProtestants. Once the Calvinist Church gained power, however, they\nbegan persecuting other sects, such as the Remonstrants who disagreed\nwith them. In France, religious conflict had been temporarily quieted\nby the edict of Nantes. But in 1685, the year in which Locke wrote the\nFirst Letter concerning religious toleration, Louis XIV had revoked\nthe Edict of Nantes, and the Huguenots were being persecuted and though prohibited from doing so, emigrated on mass. People in England were keenly aware of the\nevents taking place in France.  \nIn England itself, religious conflict dominated the seventeenth\ncentury, contributing in important respects to the coming of the\nEnglish Civil War, and the abolishing of the Anglican Church during\nthe Protectorate. After the Restoration of Charles II, Anglicans in\nparliament passed laws which repressed both Catholics and Protestant\nsects such as Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers and Unitarians who did\nnot agree with the doctrines or practices of the state Church. Of\nthese various dissenting sects, some were closer to the Anglicans,\nothers more remote. One reason among others why King Charles may have\nfound Shaftesbury useful was that they were both concerned about\nreligious toleration. They parted when it became clear that the King\nwas mainly interested in toleration for Catholics, and Shaftesbury for\nProtestant dissenters. \nOne widely discussed strategy for reducing religious conflict in\nEngland was called comprehension. The idea was to reduce the doctrines\nand practices of the Anglican church to a minimum so that most, if not\nall, of the dissenting sects would be included in the state church.\nFor those which even this measure would not serve, there was to be\ntoleration. Toleration we may define as a lack of state persecution.\nNeither of these strategies made much progress during the course of\nthe Restoration. \nWhat were Locke’s religious views and where did he fit into the\ndebates about religious toleration? This is a quite difficult question\nto answer. Religion and Christianity in particular is perhaps the most\nimportant influence on the shape of Locke’s philosophy. But what\nkind of Christian was Locke? Locke’s family were Puritans. At\nOxford, Locke avoided becoming an Anglican priest. Still, Locke\nhimself claimed to be an Anglican until he died and Locke’s\nnineteenth century biographer Fox Bourne thought that Locke was an\nAnglican. Others have identified him with the Latitudinarians—a\nmovement among Anglicans to argue for a reasonable Christianity that\ndissenters ought to accept. Still, there are some reasons to think\nthat Locke was neither an orthodox Anglican or a Latitudinarian. Locke\ngot Isaac Newton to write Newton’s most powerful\nanti-Trinitarian tract. Locke arranged to have the work published\nanonymously in Holland though in the end Newton decided not to publish\n(McLachlan 1941). This strongly suggests that Locke too was by this\ntime an Arian or unitarian. (Arius, c. 250–336, asserted the\nprimacy of the Father over the Son and thus rejected the doctrine of\nthe Trinity and was condemned as a heretic at the Council of Nicaea in\n325. Newton held that the Church had gone in the wrong direction in\ncondemning Arius.) Given that one main theme of Locke’s\nLetter on Toleration is that there should be a separation\nbetween Church and State, this does not seem like the view of a man\ndevoted to a state religion. It might appear that Locke’s\nwriting The Reasonableness of Christianity in which he argues\nthat the basic doctrines of Christianity are few and compatible with\nreason make him a Latitudinarian. Yet Richard Ashcraft has argued that\ncomprehension for the Anglicans meant conforming to the existing\npractices of the Anglican Church; that is, the abandonment of\nreligious dissent. Ashcraft also suggests that Latitudinarians were\nthus not a moderate middle ground between contending extremes but part\nof one of the extremes—“the acceptable face of the\npersecution of religious dissent” (Ashcraft 1992: 155). Ashcraft\nholds that while the Latitudinarians may have represented the\n“rational theology” of the Anglican church, there was a\ncompeting dissenting “rational theology”. Thus, while it\nis true that Locke had Latitudinarian friends, given Ashcraft’s\ndistinction between Anglican and dissenting “rational\ntheologies”, it is entirely possible that The Reasonableness\nof Christianity is a work of dissenting “rational\ntheology”. \nLocke had been thinking, talking and writing about religious\ntoleration since 1659. His views evolved. In the early 1660s he very\nlikely was an orthodox Anglican. He and Shaftesbury had instituted\nreligious toleration in the Fundamental Constitutions of the\nCarolinas (1669). He wrote the Epistola de Tolerantia in\nLatin in 1685 while in exile in Holland. He very likely was seeing\nProtestant refugees pouring over the borders from France where Louis\nXIV had just revoked the Edict of Nantes. Holland itself was a\nCalvinist theocracy with significant problems with religious\ntoleration. But Locke’s Letter does not confine itself to the\nissues of the time. Locke gives a principled account of religious\ntoleration, though this is mixed in with arguments which apply only to\nChristians, and perhaps in some cases only to Protestants. He excluded\nboth Catholics and atheists from religious toleration. In the case of\nCatholics it was because he regarded them as agents of a foreign\npower. Because they do not believe in God, atheists, on Locke’s\naccount: “Promises, covenants and oaths, which are the bonds of\nhuman society, can have no hold upon an atheist” (Mendus 1991:\n47). He gives his general defense of religious toleration while\ncontinuing the anti-Papist rhetoric of the Country party which sought\nto exclude James II from the throne. \nLocke’s arguments for religious toleration connect nicely to his\naccount of civil government. Locke defines life, liberty, health and\nproperty as our civil interests. These are the proper concern of a\nmagistrate or civil government. The magistrate can use force and\nviolence where this is necessary to preserve civil interests against\nattack. This is the central function of the state. One’s\nreligious concerns with salvation, however, are not within the domain\nof civil interests, and so lie outside of the legitimate concern of\nthe magistrate or the civil government. In effect, Locke adds an\nadditional right to the natural rights of life, liberty, health and\nproperty—the right of freedom to choose one’s own road to\nsalvation. (See the section on\n Toleration\n in the entry on Locke’s Political Philosophy.) \nLocke holds that the use of force by the state to get people to hold\ncertain beliefs or engage in certain ceremonies or practices is\nillegitimate. The chief means which the magistrate has at her disposal\nis force, but force is not an effective means for changing or\nmaintaining belief. Suppose then, that the magistrate uses force so as\nto make people profess that they believe. Locke writes: \nA sweet religion, indeed, that obliges men to dissemble, and tell lies\nto both God and man, for the salvation of their souls! If the\nmagistrate thinks to save men thus, he seems to understand little of\nthe way of salvation; and if he does it not in order to save them, why\nis he so solicitous of the articles of faith as to enact them by a\nlaw&quest; (Mendus 1991: 41)  \nSo, religious persecution by the state is inappropriate. Locke holds\nthat “Whatever is lawful in the commonwealth cannot be\nprohibited by the magistrate in the church”. This means that the\nuse of bread and wine, or even the sacrificing of a calf could not be\nprohibited by the magistrate.  \nIf there are competing churches, one might ask which one should have\nthe power? The answer is clearly that power should go to the true\nchurch and not to the heretical church. But Locke claims this amounts\nto saying nothing. For every church believes itself to be the true\nchurch, and there is no judge but God who can determine which of these\nclaims is correct. Thus, skepticism about the possibility of religious\nknowledge is central to Locke’s argument for religious\ntoleration. \nFinally, for an account of the influence of Locke’s works, see\nthe supplementary document:\n Supplement on the Influence of Locke’s Works\n ","contact.mail":"buzgalis@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
