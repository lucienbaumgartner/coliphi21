What is beauty? Is there is a\nstandard of taste and of beauty? What is the relation between the\nbeauty of nature and that of artistic representation? What is the\nrelation between one fine art and another? How ought the fine arts be\nranked one against another? What is the nature of the sublime and\nought it be ranked with the beautiful? What is the nature of genius\nand what is its relation to taste?\n\n\nAlthough none of these questions was peripheral to\n18th-century British aesthetics, not all were equally\ncentral. The question on which the others tended to turn was the\nquestion concerning the nature of taste. But this question was not\nsimply how best generally to define taste. Everyone seems to have been\nin at least rough agreement with Joseph Addison’s early\ndefinition of taste as “that faculty of soul, which discerns the\nbeauties of an author with pleasure, and the imperfections with\ndislike” (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). But agreeing with\nAddison meant agreeing only to use “taste” to refer to\nthat faculty and to acknowledge that such discerning has something of\nthe phenomenology of sensation. The central question was how to think\nof taste so defined. Is taste a higher, cognitive faculty, akin\nperhaps to reason, with objects of a primarily intellectual nature? Or\nis it a lower, bodily faculty, more akin to the five bodily senses,\nand with objects of a primarily material nature? The major theories\nthat arose in response to this question can be grouped into three main\nlineages: (a) internal-sense theories, of which the theories of\nShaftesbury (1711), Hutcheson (1725), Hume (1739–40, 1751, and\n1757) and Reid (1785) are representative; (b) imagination theories, of\nwhich theories of Addison (1712) and Burke (1757/59) are\nrepresentative; and (c) association theories, of which the theories of\nGerard (1757) and Alison (1790) are representative. \n\nShaftesbury takes up aesthetic questions from time to time across his\nCharacteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times\n(first published in 1711), particularly within its third, fourth, and\nfifth Treatises. But it is perhaps only within this last\ntreatise—the dialogue The Moralists, a Philosophical\nRhapsody—that he can be said to develop a theory of taste.\nNear the beginning of the dialogue’s climactic section (Section\nII of Book III) Shaftesbury’s spokesman, Theocles, issues a pair\nof imperatives: one ought “never to admire the\nRepresentative-Beauty, except for the sake of the\nOriginal; nor aim at other Enjoyment than of the\nrational kind” (Cooper 1711/2001, 221). It is largely\nin the subsequent explication of these imperatives that\nShaftesbury’s highly influential theory of taste emerges. \nShaftesbury does not intend the force of these imperatives to be\nnegative merely. He clearly thinks that one ought to admire the\noriginal beauty referred to in the first imperative; indeed he later\nidentifies it with the beauty of the divine mind. Moreover, the\nadmiration of beauty referred to in the first imperative just is the\nenjoyment of the rational kind referred to in the second. Hence the\ntwo imperatives, reversing their order, might be paraphrased as\nfollows: one ought to seek the enjoyment of beauty as opposed to the\nrival enjoyments that one might mistake for the enjoyment of beauty;\nand the enjoyment of beauty that one ought to seek ought always to be\nfor the sake of the original as opposed to the sake of the\nrepresentative merely. To say that the rival enjoyments that one might\ntake for the enjoyment of beauty are not “of the\nrational kind” is to say that they are merely sensory\nor bodily in nature. Such non-rational enjoyments, moreover, are\n“interested” in the sense that they depend on the thought\nof, and beget a desire for, the use or possession of their objects.\nTheocles illustrates this point with a series of examples culminating\nin that of sexual pleasure taken at the sight of a human body.\n“I … was apprehensive,” says his interlocutor,\nPhilocles, that \nAn example surfacing a bit later serves both to reinforce the\ndistinction between such non-rational enjoyments and the rational\nenjoyment of beauty and to introduce the distinction between the\nadmiration of representative beauty for its own sake and that for the\nsake of the original. Enjoyment taken in the sight of a coin is\nenjoyment taken in its beauty only if it arises not from any thought\nof what the coin may buy, but merely from the contemplation of the\ndesign or form of the coin’s inscription. Whether in addition\nthis is admiration of the coin’s representative beauty for the\nsake of the original depends on whether one recognizes the\nrepresentative nature of the coin’s beauty. Because the coin is\nbeautiful in virtue of its design or form, it is beautiful not in\nvirtue of its material properties but in virtue of the effect that\nsome mind has had upon it. But if the coin is beautiful in virtue of\nthe effect of some mind upon it, this can only be because that mind is\nitself beautiful, the beauty of the coin being representative merely\nof the original beauty of that mind. Hence to admire the beauty of the\ncoin (or the beauty of any material object) without acknowledging that\nits beauty merely shadows the beauty of the mind that designed it is\nto fail to admire representative beauty for the sake of the original\n(Cooper 1711/2001, 225–226). \nBut there is a complication. If the mind that formed the coin is a\nhuman mind, then, while its beauty is original relative to the coin,\nit is representative relative to the beauty of the mind that formed\nit. Hence there are “Three Degrees or Orders of\nBeauty”: \nHence all beauty ultimately “resolves it-self” (Cooper\n1711/2001, 228) into the beauty of the divine mind: \nThus admiring the representative beauty of the coin for the sake of\nthe original requires tracing its beauty not merely to the mind that\ndesigned it, but also to the mind that designed that mind. \nA consequence of the view that the divine mind is the source of all\nbeauty is that beauty is not relative to human nature merely, but is\nabsolute and real. Indeed, given Shaftesbury’s pantheistic\nleanings, things turn out, on his view, to be beautiful quite\nliterally from the point of view of the universe. A further\nconsequence is that beauty, inhering only in mind or in its\nreflection, cannot be grasped by any bodily sense, but only by the\nmind itself: \nBut Shaftesbury does not rest with the claim that it is the mind that\ngrasps beauty: he adds the claim that it is by a “mental”\nor “internal” sense that the mind does so. Though it is\ndifficult to know just what Shaftesbury takes this momentous claim to\ncome to, the general idea is that the faculty by which the mind\ndiscerns beauty has enough in common with external sense to warrant\nthe term “sense” and to be regarded as no less natural (or\nbasic) than external sense. In The Moralists he observes that\nthe discernment of beauty has the immediacy of external sensation and\nso must be regarded as natural as external sensation. No sooner is an\nobject of the right kind placed before the mind \nAnd, in a famous passage from An Inquiry concerning Virtue and\nMerit (Treatise IV), Shaftesbury observes that the discernment of\nbeauty has the necessity or will-independence of external sensation\nand so again must be regarded as natural on a par with external\nsensation. Once an object of the right kind is placed before the mind,\na verdict as to its beauty cannot be withheld: \nOn the title page of the first edition of his An Inquiry into the\nOriginal of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue (1725), Francis\nHutcheson acknowledges a deep debt to Shaftesbury, announcing that\n“The Principles of the late Earl of Shaftsbury” would be\nexplained and defended therein. But it is open to question whether\nHutcheson overstates his debt. The debt is deepest with regard to the\nnotion of internal sense, but Hutcheson can fairly be said to make\nthis notion his own. That is certainly the judgment of history: anyone\nundertaking to explain, defend, or refute the notion of internal sense\nafter 1725 took himself to be explaining, defending, or refuting the\nprinciples of Dr. Hutcheson. \nHutcheson gives one argument for the sensibility, and another for the\ninternality, of the power by which we discern beauty. His argument for\nits sensibility is largely a systematization and amplification of\nShaftesbury’s. That the discernment of beauty is sensible\nfollows from the immediacy, necessity, and disinterestedness of the\narising of the pleasure by which beauty is discerned: \nIt is in arguing for the internality of the power of discerning beauty\nthat Hutcheson’s departure from Shaftesbury begins to show.\nShaftesbury, it will be recalled, argues that the discernment of\nbeauty is internal (or mental) on the grounds that the objects of\nbeauty necessarily are: mind alone can discern beauty because mind\nalone is beautiful, external objects managing a degree of beauty only\nby having a bit of mind imprinted on them. But Hutcheson cannot make\nthis argument because he does not think that objects of beauty are\nnecessarily internal. Hutcheson does follow Shaftesbury in\nmaintaining that things are beautiful in virtue of their proportion or\norder (Hutcheson’s preferred and more precise term is\n“uniformity amidst variety”) and he may follow\nShaftesbury in thinking all proportion or order to be the effect of\nmind. But he importantly does not follow Shaftesbury in\ninferring from the premise that things are beautiful owing to the\neffect of mind to the conclusion that mind alone is beautiful. \nHutcheson begins his argument for the internality of the power of\ndiscerning beauty by observing that the five external senses are\ninsufficient for that discernment—one could have all five in\nperfect working order and yet be insensible to beauty (Hutcheson\n1726/2004, 23). This observation, however, does not seem to show the\ndiscernment of beauty to be internal. It seems to show merely that\nsuch discernment cannot be identified with any known external power.\nBut Hutcheson continues: \nHere the reasoning is that the power of discerning beauty must be\ninternal because some objects of beauty are. But given that\nHutcheson concedes that many objects of beauty are not internal, the\nproper conclusion seems to be that the power of discerning beauty is\nneither exclusively internal nor exclusively external. In any case,\nthe power of discerning beauty cannot be internal after\nShaftesbury’s manner. \nBut after what manner is it internal then? Hutcheson simply never says\nin An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and\nVirtue, though he wastes no time supplying this deficiency in the\nimmediately subsequent An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the\nPassions and Affections (first published in 1727). An internal\nsense, he there clarifies, is one whose ideas arise only if certain\nother ideas have already arisen. Sight is not an internal sense since\nthe arising of the idea of blue, for example, does not depend upon the\nprevious arising of any other idea. But the sense of beauty is\ninternal because the arising of the pleasurable idea of beauty depends\n“upon the previous Reception and Comparison of various sensible\nPerceptions … or intellectual ideas, when we find Uniformity\n… among them” (Hutcheson 1742/2002, 16). Another way of\nputting the point is to say that internal senses depend for their\nobjects on the operation of other powers while external senses do not.\nHence in point of internality internal senses are apparently on a par\nwith the powers of reason and memory, for example: unless some other\npower or powers has operated to place an object before the mind, there\nis nothing about which to reason, nothing to remember, and nothing\ninternally to sense. This use of “internal” and\n“external” may be thought misleading, given that it allows\nboth external and internal powers to operate on objects both bodily\nand intellectual, both from within and from without. Hutcheson came to\nagree with this criticism apparently. In later works, he replaces\n“internal” with “reflex” or\n“subsequent” to refer to powers that depend on others for\ntheir objects, and “external” with “direct” or\n“antecedent” to refer to powers that do not. (Hutcheson\n1747, 12–13 and 1744, 48). \nThis transformation of Shaftesbury’s notion of an internal sense\nis not the only consequence of Hutcheson’s rejection of the view\nthat mind alone is beautiful. It will be recalled that it is this\nview—or, more particularly, the view that all beauty reduces to\nthe beauty of the divine mind—that undergirds\nShaftesbury’s aesthetic realism and hence his absolutism. But\nHutcheson has neither this nor any substitute view by which to prop up\nan alternative version of realism, and settles hesitantly on a version\nof idealism, and hence relativism, that understands the idea of beauty\non the model of an idea of a Lockean secondary quality: \nMoreover there seems to be no necessity that the idea of beauty should\narise, as it does, in response to objects having uniformity amidst\nvariety. Had it pleased him to do so, God might have given us a sense\nof beauty responsive to irregularity amidst simplicity (Hutcheson\n1726/2004, 80). \nBut that God might not have given us a sense of beauty responsive to\nuniformity amidst variety raises the question why he did. Though it is\na question that never arises for Shaftesbury, Hutcheson gives it an\nanswer that narrows the distance between the two. As Shaftesbury had\nfamously stressed, the universe is highly ordered—at least\n“Uniformity, Proportion, and Similitude [are diffused] thro all\nthe Parts of Nature which we can observe” (Hutcheson 1726/2004,\n81). In such a universe, “[t]he manner of Knowledge by universal\nTheorems … must be most convenient for Beings of limited\nUnderstanding and Power” (Hutcheson 1726/2004, 79). But if such\nis the manner of knowledge most convenient for beings such as us, a\nbenevolent God may be expected to provide some immediate\nmotive—a motive, that is, that does not require that we reflect\non what is most convenient for us—to our pursuit of it. Because\na theorem by nature possesses uniformity amidst variety—a\ntheorem simply is the unification of various particulars under a\nsingle principle (Hutcheson 1726/2004, 36)—it stands to reason\nthat \nSo it is in the perception of objects of intellect—theorems,\nnamely—that the internal sense of beauty has its raison\nd’etre, and it is by resembling theorems in point of\nuniformity that other objects, including material objects, are\nbeautiful. In this way Hutcheson recovers an element of\nShaftesbury’s theory that had apparently been lost in his\ntransformation of Shaftesbury’s notion of internal\nsense—he recovers a priority of the intellectual over the\nmaterial as object of beauty. This is not to say that Hutcheson\nrecovers Shaftesbury’s priority exactly. Shaftesbury’s\npriority is reductive, having its ground in the distinction between\nrepresentative and original beauty. By contrast Hutcheson draws no\nsuch distinction and so allows material objects to be beautiful in\ntheir own right. \nHume takes his notion of taste over from Hutcheson. He regards taste\nas an “internal sense” which depends on the operation of other\nmental faculties to “pave the way” for its pronouncements by\nsupplying it with an object upon which to pronounce (Hume 1751/1986,\n173). Which mental faculties must operate, and which operations those\nfaculties must perform, varies from object to object:  \nHume shows less interest than Hutcheson does in determining which\nfeature or features of objects result in our finding them beautiful.\nHutcheson, it will be recalled, argues that we take the pleasure of\nbeauty in response to all and only objects in which we find uniformity\namidst variety. Hume resists any such tidy formula, speaking of\nmultiple principles of taste. The only time he elaborates on any\nparticular principle is in The Treatise, where he holds, contra\nHutcheson, that the beauty we find in many objects owes, at least in\npart, to their usefulness. Hutcheson had denied that the usefulness of\nan object could play any role in our finding it beautiful, on the\ngrounds that judgments of taste are necessarily disinterested whereas\njudgments of usefulness are necessarily interested. Against this Hume\nobserves that judgments of taste are necessarily disinterested only in\nthe sense that they are necessarily non-self-interested, and that I\nmight therefore judge a chair to be beautiful on the basis of its\nbeing useful to someone, though not on the basis that it is useful to\nme (Hume 1739-40/1987, 363-365). \nHume follows Hutcheson in regarding the idea of beauty as analogous to\na Lockean secondary quality, and so follows Hutcheson in holding\nbeauty to be subjective, having no existence outside of the mind that\ncontemplates it (Hume 1757/1987, 230). But Hume reckons more directly\nthan Hutcheson does with the price such a subjectivism exacts, namely,\nits apparent inconsistency with our practice of counting some\njudgments of beauty as correct and others as incorrect. This reckoning\nstarts with the observation that the subjectivity of colors is no\nbarrier to our counting some color judgments correct and some\nincorrect. Anyone who has the idea of redness can recognize the\nconditions under which we count an object as veridically manifesting\nredness, namely, “its appearance in day-light to the eye of a\nman in health” (Hume 1757/1987, 233-234). Similarly, Hume holds\nthat anyone with the idea of beauty can recognize the conditions under\nwhich we count an object as veridically manifesting beauty (Hume\n1757/1987, 233-234). These conditions are the appearance of beauty to\nthose (1) whose taste is delicate (Hume 1757/1987, 234-237), (2) who\nhave practiced (Hume 1757/1987, 237-238), (3) who have made certain\ncomparisons (Hume 1757/1987, 238), (4) who lack prejudice (Hume\n1757/1987, 239-240), and (5) whose understanding is sound (Hume\n1757/1987, 240-241). Conditions (1), (2), and (5) are evidently\nsupposed to guarantee that the object is grasped as having all and\nonly the aesthetically relevant properties it has, whereas conditions\n(3) and (4) are evidently supposed to guarantee that a properly\ncalibrated sentiment arises from the object as grasped. In sum, we\ntake an object’s beauty to appear as it is, according to Hume,\nwhen and only when the right sentiment arises from the object rightly\ngrasped.  \nThomas Reid’s theory of taste, as developed in the final essay\nof his Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (first\npublished in 1785), makes use of a range of theoretical resources that\nhad become available by the last decades of the Eighteenth Century.\nIts account of sublimity owes to Burke; its treatment of novelty owes\nto Addison and to Gerard; the use it makes of association may owe to\nGerard as well. But as an internal-sense theory its debt is\nprincipally to Hutcheson and to Shaftesbury. \nReid adheres to Hutcheson’s notion of internal sense rather than\nto Shaftesbury’s. Indeed Reid’s account of\nHutcheson’s notion is arguably sharper than any Hutcheson ever\ngives: \nBut while Reid agrees with Hutcheson about what makes the sense of\nbeauty internal, he disagrees with Hutcheson about what is\n“ingredient” to that sense (Reid 1785/1969, 782).\nHutcheson, as Reid understands him, posits but one ingredient: an\nagreeable feeling or emotion resembling nothing in the object. But it\nis in restricting himself to this single affective ingredient, Reid\nthinks, that Hutcheson puts himself on the path to Lockean\nanti-realism with respect to beauty, since it may be thought that if\nthe sensation of beauty consists merely in such a feeling it refers to\nnothing in the object, and if it refers to nothing in the object then\nit must refer merely to “the perception of some Mind”\n(Hutcheson 1726/2004, 27). \nReid takes this position to be “not so much an error in\njudgment, as an abuse of words” (Reid 1785/1969, 782). There are\nwords by which one may say of Virgil’s Georgics that it\nis the cause of a feeling, but these are not the words The\nGeorgics is beautiful; there is no reason to think they say\nanything of The Georgics other than that it has the property\nof beauty (Reid 1785/1969, 759). Hence a theory of taste that does not\ncontradict “the universal sense of mankind, as expressed by\ntheir language” (Reid 1785/1969, 760) must allow the internal\nsense of beauty to have, in addition to its affective ingredient, a\ncognitive one—a judgment ascribing a property to the object. \nReid appears to acknowledge that allowing the sense of beauty this\ncognitive dimension does not commit one to realism regarding beauty:\nhe appears to acknowledge that it is one thing to allow that the\ndeliverances of internal sense comprise judgments and yet another to\nallow that the positive judgments they sometimes comprise are\nsometimes true (Reid 1785/1969, 783). The case Reid makes for realism\nregarding beauty (and sublimity) is complex. He makes a\nstraightforward appeal to common sense (Reid 1785/1969, 770). He\nargues, after Descartes, that our possession of an inherently\nfallacious sense would make a deceiver of God (Reid 1785/1969, 783).\nBut his deepest and most complicated reason for thinking beauty real\nhas to do with the nature of the properties that he takes to ground\nbeauty. Following Burke, Reid identifies the affect properly inspired\nby beautiful objects as love (this contrasts with the affect properly\ninspired by sublime objects, which he identifies as admiration). Since\nwe properly love only what is good, the properties that properly\ninspire love must be perfections or excellences of some kind. It\nfollows that the beauty of an object has its ground in whatever\nperfections properly inspire our love for it, and so has whatever\nreality those perfections have. \nReid concedes that we are only sometimes able to specify the\nperfections in virtue of which we judge things beautiful. He refers to\njudgments in which the perfection cannot be specified as\n“instinctive” and judgments in which it can be as\n“rational” (Reid 1785/1969, 785–787). Hence it is\nnecessarily from an incomplete set of data that his enquiry into\nbeauty-grounding perfections proceeds. That enquiry begins with a\nconsideration of those perfections in virtue of which we judge minds\nbeautiful, that is, the perfections that inspire love for the minds\nthat possess them. Reid finds that these perfections divide into three\nclasses: first, the amiable moral virtues, which include\n“[i]nnocence, gentleness, condescension, humanity, natural\naffection, public spirit”; second, the amiable intellectual\ntalents, which include, “knowledge, good sense, wit, humour,\ncheerfulness, good taste, excellence in any of the fine arts”;\nand, third, certain perfections pertaining to the mind’s active\npowers—perfections that “render the body a fit instrument\nfor the mind”—including “health, strength, and\nagility” (Reid 1785/1969, 792). Reid finds further that these\nperfections are not relative to human nature but absolute: \nThus Reid concludes that “[t]here is therefore a real intrinsic\nexcellence in some qualities of mind, as in power, knowledge, wisdom,\nvirtue, magnanimity,” and that a mind in possession of such\nqualities is therein really beautiful (Reid 1785/1969, 771). \nWhen Reid enquires next after the perfections in virtue of which we\nascribe beauty to material objects, his account takes a Shaftesburian\nturn. Reid revives Shaftesbury’s distinction between original\nand representative beauty (though he prefers the term\n“derived” to “representative”) and also\nShaftesbury’s claim that the beauty of material objects derives\nfrom the original beauty of minds. This allows him to maintain that\nthe perfections in virtue of which we attribute beauty to material\nobjects just are the perfections in virtue of which we attribute\nbeauty to minds. But whereas Shaftesbury simply infers without further\nargument the reduction of material to mental beauty from the premise\nthat material beauty is the effect of mind, Reid takes up instance\nafter instance of material beauty, arguing with respect to each that\nit is best understood as a “sign” of some instance of\nmental beauty. The beauty we attribute to inanimate nature signifies\nthe wisdom and goodness of the mind that fashioned it for our use\n(Reid 1785/1969, 799–800); the beauty we attribute to animals,\ninsofar as we regard them as minded, signifies “their instincts,\ntheir appetites, their affections, their sagacity” (Reid\n1785/1969, 794); the beauty we attribute to the human form signifies\neither “some perfection of the body, as a part of the man, and\nan instrument of the mind” or “some amiable quality or\nattribute of the mind itself” (Reid 1785/1969, 806). \nIt may be objected that such a reduction of material to mental beauty\ncannot serve Reid’s case for realism, at least as it applies to\nmaterial objects. For it may seem that the beauty we attribute to\nmaterial objects can never be real, by Reid’s lights, given that\nno material object ever can have any of the mental perfections capable\nof grounding beauty. But such an objection misses a subtlety of\nReid’s position. Strictly speaking, material objects never are\nbeautiful. But this does not imply that the beauty that we attribute\nto them never is real. It is real, at least generally, though strictly\nspeaking it belongs only to the minds that the material objects in\nquestion signify. If it seems to us that these objects themselves\npossess beauty, this is because beauty is prone to be\n“transferred” or “communicated” from the minds\nthat really have it to the material objects that merely signify it\n(Reid 1785/1969, 788). Reid never uses the term\n“association” to refer to the mechanism by which beauty is\nthus communicated from mental signified to material sign. But that he\ndoes not distance himself from association—the mechanism by then\nat the center of a great deal of theorizing about taste—makes it\nhard to deny that it has found a positive role in his own theory. \nJoseph Addison’s theory of taste resides principally in the work\nAddison refers to as his “essay on the pleasures of the\nimagination” (Addison and Steele 1879, nos. 409 and 421). It\ncomprises eleven papers—nos. 411 through 421—appearing in\nthe journal The Spectator on successive days during the\nsummer of 1712. The timing of the essay’s publication raises\nquestions about its relation to Shaftesbury’s\nCharacteristics, which had appeared one year earlier. But it\nis difficult to detect even a hint of Shaftesbury’s theory of\ntaste in Addison’s. That the two theories deeply oppose one\nanother might suggest that Addison’s is a reaction against\nShaftesbury’s. But Addison does not engage Shaftesbury: rather\nhe tends simply to assume what Shaftesbury simply denies and\nvice-versa. Moreover Addison understood himself to be undertaking\nsomething “entirely new” in advancing a theory of taste\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). It seems best to conclude,\ntherefore, that there are two original British theories of taste.\nWhile it would be hard to say which was more influential, it is easy\nto say that each was greatly so: every subsequent British theory of\ntaste, at least until the close of the Eighteenth Century, shows the\nstrong influence of one, the other, or both. \nAddison’s fundamental idea is that the pleasures of taste are\npleasures of the imagination. This should not be taken to imply that\nAddison identifies taste with the imagination. Taste is a faculty of\njudgment: it discerns the perfections of an author with pleasure\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 409). Imagination is a faculty of\nrepresentation: it represents things in images; it is the faculty of\nvisual representation (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 411). Hence\nAddison’s fundamental idea comes to this, apparently: taste\njudges what the imagination represents; the perfections that taste\ndiscerns with pleasure are perfections that things have as objects of\nvisual representation. But if objects of taste are objects of visual\nrepresentation, then objects of taste are first and foremost material\nobjects: mountain ranges, waterfalls, sexually attractive bodies are\namong the paradigms Addison offers (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412).\nIt is here that the contrast with Shaftesbury becomes plain. It will\nbe recalled that Shaftesbury holds objects of taste to be first and\nforemost objects of intellect, and that the fundamental difficulty\nthat his theory must overcome is to explain our intuition that\nmaterial objects are also capable of beauty. With Addison it is just\nthe reverse. \nAddison distinguishes two classes of pleasures of the imagination:\nprimary pleasures, which derive from images of objects currently\npresent to sight; and secondary pleasures, which derive from images of\nobjects currently absent from sight and so called up before the mind\nin some other way. He then divides primary pleasures into three\nclasses: those proceeding from the sight of what is great (or\nsublime); those proceeding from the sight of what is novel; and those\nproceeding from the sight of what is beautiful. A great object is one\nso large as to strain the imagination’s capacity to render it:\nits apprehension flings the mind into a “pleasing\nastonishment” and a “delightful stillness and\namazement” (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). A novel object is\none new or strange to their viewer; its apprehension “fills the\nsoul with an agreeable surprise” and “gratifies its\ncuriosity” (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). A beautiful\nobject is either an object of sexual attraction or one possessing a\n“gaiety or variety of colors” or “a symmetry or\nproportion of parts” (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412); the\napprehension of beautiful objects strikes the mind with a\n“secret [i.e., inexplicable] satisfaction and complacency”\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). \nAddison’s chief interest in secondary pleasures owes to their\ncomprising the pleasures of artistic representation: representational\nartworks, he maintains, function centrally to call up mental images of\nobjects that are great, novel, or beautiful. So Homer excels in the\nrepresentation of great things, Virgil in the representation of\nbeautiful things, Ovid in the representation of novel things, and\nMilton in the representation of all three (Addison and Steele 1879,\nno. 417). But Addison acknowledges that this account of the pleasures\nof artistic representation is so far incomplete; indeed he devotes a\ngood portion the latter part of the essay to its supplementation. \nIt seems clear, for starters, that our interest in artistic\nrepresentations is not exhausted by our interest in what they\nrepresent: we take pleasure in the representations themselves as\nrepresentations. To supply this deficiency Addison proposes a “a\nnew principle of pleasure, which is nothing else but the action of the\nmind, which compares the ideas that arise from [the representation],\nwith the ideas that arise from the objects themselves” (Addison\nand Steele 1879, no. 418). The description of a beautiful scene\npleases us, according to this proposal, both for the beauty of the\nscene and for “the aptness of the description to excite its\nimage” (Addison and Steele 1879, no 418). But Addison himself\nseems less than fully convinced by this proposal, since there is no\nreason to think of a pleasure arising from an act of comparison as a\npleasure of the imagination; such a pleasure, he concedes, “may\nbe more properly called the pleasure of the understanding”\n(Addison and Steele 1879, no. 418). \nA second deficiency concerns our interest in the artistic\nrepresentations of things positively disagreeable, such as our\ninterest in the performances of tragedies. The difficulty is that it\nseems we ought always to prefer representations of the agreeable,\nsince they alone are capable of pleasing according to both principles\nso far advanced. Hence Addison recruits a third principle of pleasure:\nrepresentations of the disagreeable please us by the contrast they\npresent between the disagreeable scene they represent and the\ncomparatively agreeable situation in which we find ourselves: \nA third perceived deficiency derives from the common intuition that\nsome pleasures of artistic representation derive from the\nrepresentation of purely intellectual objects, such as abstract moral,\ncritical, or scientific truths. Addison concedes the truth of this\nintuition, but maintains that pleasures derived from the\nrepresentation of such intellectual objects are pleasures of taste\nonly insofar as the objects are represented metaphorically as having\nmaterial form: \nThe materialist basis of Addison’s theory disposes it to a\nrelativism and so to an anti-realism with respect to the perfections\nof taste, much as the intellectualist basis of the theories of\nShaftesbury and Reid disposes them to an absolutism and so to a\nrealism. Because the pleasures of taste are pleasures taken merely in\nthe visual representation of material objects, there is no reason to\nthink any creature capable of visual representation incapable of such\npleasures. But there is also no reason to think all creatures capable\nof such pleasures capable of all the same pleasures from all the same\nobjects. Indeed there is every reason to think that \nHence Addison concludes that “[t]here is not perhaps any real\nbeauty … more in one piece of matter than another” and\nthat beauty—and also greatness and novelty,\npresumably—exists in the mind merely merely (Addison and Steele\n1879, nos. 412 and 413). \nThe conception of imagination at work in Edmund Burke’s A\nPhilosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and\nthe Beautiful (published in 1757/1759) is a successor to\nAddison’s, though it has undergone expansion along one dimension\nand contraction along another. \nThe expansion presumably responds to a problem arising from the\napplication Addison’s fundamental idea—the idea that the\npleasures of taste are pleasures of visual representation—to\nobjects that do not present themselves visually, such as literary and\nmusical works. With respect to such objects Addison is forced to\nmaintain either that they function mainly to prompt mental images of\nobjects that do present themselves visually, or that the pleasures\nthey afford are not mainly pleasures of taste (he takes the former\nline with respect to literary works and the latter, apparently, with\nrespect to music (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 416)). It is presumably\nto mitigate this difficulty that Burke adopts a conception of the\nimagination that encompasses all five sense modalities. Thus whereas\nfor Addison one can imagine merely how things look, for Burke one can\nalso imagine how they sound, taste, smell, and feel. Though this\nbroadened conception is not unique to Burke, it is unlikely that any\nother theorist of taste so fully exploits its breadth: each sense\nmodality has its moment in A Philosophical Enquiry,\nfrom a section on the beauty of surfaces as revealed by touch (Burke\n1990, 110–111) to one on the sublimity of “Bitters and\nStenches” (Burke 1990, 78–79). \nThe contraction also presumably responds to problem in Addison, this\ntime to an apparent inconsistency in the conception of imagination\nitself. Addison opposes the pleasures of the imagination to the\npleasures of sense, on one hand, and to the pleasures of the\nunderstanding, on the other (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 411). But he\nalso defines the pleasures of the imagination as those arising from\nthe visual representation of things, and allows that some of those\npleasures—those he calls “the primary pleasures of the\nimagination”—arise from things present to vision (Addison\nand Steele 1879, no. 411). Thus it becomes hard to say what the\nopposition between the pleasures of sense and the pleasures of the\nimagination can amount to. It is presumably to relieve this tension\nthat Burke recasts Addison’s distinction between primary and\nsecondary pleasures of the imagination as a distinction between\n“the primary pleasures of sense” and “the secondary\npleasures of the imagination” (Burke 1990, 22). \nIt is a complicated question whether Burke takes the primary pleasures\nof sense and the secondary pleasures of the imagination jointly to\nexhaust the pleasures of taste. In the 1759 addition to A\nPhilosophical Enquiry (the “Introduction on Taste”)\nBurke allows that objects of the understanding constitute “a\nvery considerable part of what are considered objects of Taste”\n(Burke 1990, 22). But that objects of the understanding cannot be\nobjects of taste seems a guiding assumption of much of the rest of the\nEnquiry: consider, for example, Burke’s claim that it\nis only as an object of the imagination, and specifically not as an\nobject of the understanding, that God can be found sublime (Burke\n1990, 62). It is worth noting, moreover, that in other respects\nBurke’s theory is more thoroughly materialist than\nAddison’s. Although Addison maintains that the pleasures of\ntaste are pleasures of the imagination, his explanations as to why\ncertain objects of imagination please are not particularly\nmaterialist. He traces the pleasure we take in “an unbounded\nview,” for example, to our regarding it as “an image of\nliberty” (Addison and Steele 1879, no. 412). Burke’s\ntendency, by contrast, is to explain the pleasures of sense and\nimagination by appeal merely to our physical constitution. He holds\nthe delight we take in the viewing very large objects, for example, to\nbe a consequence of the retina’s being struck, all at once or in\nquick succession, by the relatively many light rays that very large\nobjects reflect (Burke 1990, 124–125). \nBut Burke’s chief innovation consists neither in his conception\nof the imagination, nor in the extent of his materialism, but in his\ntheory of the perfections of taste. It will be recalled that Addison\nposits three such perfections—sublimity (or greatness), novelty,\nand beauty—though he offers no explanation as to why there\nshould be just these three. Burke argues, briefly, that novelty is too\nsuperficial and ubiquitous to keep rightful company with sublimity and\nbeauty (Burke 1990, 29). And he argues, at length, that sublimity\nkeeps rightful and exclusive company with beauty on the grounds that\nit stands to one great class of human passions as beauty stands to the\nother (Burke 1990, 30–50). According to Burke’s account of\nthe passions—which owes much to Hume’s—most all\npassions answer either to the ends of society or to the ends of\nself-preservation (Burke 1990, 35-36). Moreover, all societal passions\n“turn” on pleasure, that is, each has either pleasure or\nits felt absence as a constituent (Burke 1990, 37). The societal\npassion of love has pleasure as a constituent, for example, while the\nsocietal passion of grief has the felt absence of pleasure as a\nconstituent (Burke 1990, 34–35, 39). All self-preservative\npassions, by contrast, “turn” on pain, that is, each has\neither pain or its felt absence of pain as a constituent (Burke 1990,\n37). The self-preservative passion of simple terror has pain as a\nconstituent, for example, while the self-preservative passion of\nastonishment—a passion which arises when pain threatens though\nfrom a relatively safe distance, and which combines feelings of\nsobriety, awe, and “tranquility shadowed with\nhorror”—has the felt absence of pain as a constituent\n(Burke 1990, 32, 36–37, 53). Thus there are both desirable and\nundesirable societal passions and desirable and undesirable\nself-preservative passions. The beautiful is that which excites the\ndesirable societal passion of love, the sublime that which excites the\ndesirable self-preservative passion of astonishment (Burke 1990,\n36-37, 39, 53). The objective foundations of beauty and sublimity turn\nout to be largely opposing: whereas the beautiful tends to the small,\nthe smooth, the various, the delicate, the clear, and the bright, the\nsublime tends to the great, the uniform, the powerful, the obscure,\nand the somber. Hence Burke concludes that: \nThe impact of Burke’s aesthetic dualism was immediate. Before\nits appearance, the sublime could be ignored: there is almost no\nmention of it in Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, or Hume. Afterward it could\nnot be: indeed the major theorists of the second half of the\ncentury—Reid, Alison, and Kant—all advance substantial\ntheories of the sublime. But toward the century’s end\nBurke’s dualism began to come under pressure, not from those who\nthought two perfections too many, but from those who thought it too\nfew. Uvedale Price, following suggestions in the writings of William\nGilpin, argued that there are objects—landscapes,\nparadigmatically—which please the eye, but which can be\nconsidered neither beautiful nor sublime. These objects cannot be\nconsidered sublime because they need not be grand (Price 1796,\n106–107); they cannot be considered beautiful because they are\nnot smooth, their pleasure depending on “sudden protuberance,\nand lines that cross each other in a sudden and broken manner”\n(Price 1796, 61–62). Because the play of form, color, light, and\nshadow afforded by such objects renders them ideal subjects for\npainting and drawing, Gilpin referred to them as\n“picturesque” (Gilpin 1794, 3–5). By the end of the\ncentury, the picturesque came to be regarded widely as occupying the\nposition vacated by the novel, i.e., that of a third perfection of\ntaste. \nAlexander Gerard’s theory of taste, advanced in his 1759\nEssay on Taste, is an attempt to mediate, or perhaps to\ntranscend, the dispute between internal-sense and imagination\ntheorists. \nGerard accepts as sound Hutcheson’s argument for the internal\nsensibility of taste: that the perceptions of taste are simple, that\nthey arise immediately, and that they arise necessarily, show taste to\nbe a sense; that they are separate from and consequent upon those of\nexternal sense and reflection show taste to be internal (Gerard 1759,\n160–161). But Gerard rejects what Hutcheson regards as a\ncorollary—that taste is an ultimate or irreducible power.\nHutcheson may have taken the irreducibility of taste to follow from\nthe simplicity of its perceptions. Or he may have taken the\nirreducibility of taste to follow, by analogy, from the irreducibility\nof the external senses. But whether taste is irreducible depends\nmerely on whether its perceptions can be traced to some more basic\nmental power. Gerard believes that they can be: in fact he believes\nthat they can all be traced to “certain exertions” of the\nmore basic power of the imagination (Gerard 1759, 167). Thus while\ntaste is “itself a species of sensation … in respect of\nits principles, [it is] justly reduced to imagination” (Gerard\n1759, 160). \nBut what Gerard means by “imagination” is not what either\nAddison or Burke means, though it is not wholly unrelated either.\nOfficially at least, Gerard follows Addison and Burke in regarding\nimagination as a representational power and in opposing imagination to\nsense. But Gerard breaks from Addison and Burke crucially in also\nopposing imagination to memory. This allows him to group sense and\nmemory together as representational powers that purport to present\nideas in correspondence with reality and to isolate imagination as the\nrepresentational power that does not. That imagination is thus\nuntethered from reality does not, however, imply its utter\nlawlessness. It is governed by roughly Humean laws of association,\naccording to which it \nHence another way of putting the contrast between sense and memory, on\nthe one hand, and imagination, on the other, is to say that the former\npresent ideas according to “real bonds of union” whereas\nthe latter presents ideas according to laws of association (Gerard\n1759, 167). In this way association becomes an essential element of\nimagination. Indeed on Gerard’s view there seems, unofficially\nat least, to be no real difference between association and\nimagination—at most imagination is the locus of association. \nSo when Gerard claims that the perceptions of taste can be traced to\n“certain exertions of imagination,” the exertions\nhe has in mind are acts of association. The idea, roughly, is this.\nThe reducibility of taste implies that the perceptions of taste, which\nare pleasures, are not natural to their objects in the way Hutcheson,\nfor example, supposed. Objects of taste must, in other words, acquire\ntheir pleasurability, and association is the mechanism by which they\ndo so. Just how they do so varies, and the variations are too numerous\nfor cataloguing here. There is, however, a basic mechanism to which\nGerard recurs often in his explanations. It seems that the mind forges\nvery strong associations between its own processes and their objects,\nsuch that any pleasure natural to a mental process will transfer to\nits object. It also seems that any process that requires the mind\n“to exert its activity, and put forth its strength, in order to\nsurmount any difficulty,” is naturally pleasurable, as is the\nmind’s consciousness of its success in surmounting any\ndifficulty (Gerard 1759, 3). Hence any object whose processing is\ndifficult enough to require the relevant exertion, but not so\ndifficult as to prevent its success, will give pleasure (Gerard 1759,\n3–4). Novel objects give pleasure because their unfamiliarity\nrenders their conception just difficult enough (Gerard 1759,\n5–6). Sublime objects give pleasure because their sheer scale\nrenders their conception just difficult enough (Gerard 1759, 14).\nImitations give pleasure because marking resemblances between them and\ntheir originals is just difficult enough (Gerard 1759, 49–51).\nAnd ridiculous (that is, humorous) objects give pleasure because\nmarking dissonance or inconsistency amongst their elements is just\ndifficult enough (Gerard 1759, 66–69). \nIn these and similar ways Gerard reduces internal sense to\nimagination. An important consequence of the reduction is that it\nallows Gerard to be neutral on the question of the primacy of the\nintellectual or the material with respect to objects of taste, over\nwhich internal-sense theorists and imagination theorists had divided.\nGerard, unique among the major British theorists of his century, shows\nno inclination to make one sort of object prior to the other. Indeed,\nwithin the essay’s first pages he offers a rural prospect, a\nscientific discovery, a philosophical theory, a poem, and a painting,\nall as equally uncontroversial examples of objects of taste (Gerard\n1759, 6). \nArchibald Alison, whose Essays on the Nature and Principles of\nTaste first appeared in 1790, follows after Gerard in several\nrespects. He follows after Gerard in holding that objects of taste are\nnot naturally pleasurable, as Hutcheson had supposed, and so follows\nafter Gerard in holding that objects of taste must acquire their\npleasurability from something else that is naturally pleasurable. He\nfollows after Gerard, moreover, in holding that this acquisition\ndepends centrally on association, and follows after Gerard, finally,\nin holding that the naturally pleasurable something else is—at\nleast typically and at least in part—a mental operation of some\nsort. But he departs from Gerard regarding both the role of\nassociation and the identity of the naturally pleasurable mental\noperation. Whereas Gerard holds association merely to be a vehicle by\nwhich pleasurability is transmitted from the naturally pleasurable\nmental operation to the object of taste, Alison holds association also\nto be the central mental operation from which pleasurability is\ntransmitted to the object taste. \nThe process by which Alison takes the object of taste to acquire its\npleasurability is complicated. It begins with the object’s\neliciting some simple emotion, such as, cheerfulness, tenderness,\nmelancholy, solemnity, elevation, terror, delicacy, grace, dignity, or\nmajesty (Alison 1811, 57–58, 66). This simple emotion then\nawakens a train of associated ideas such that each idea is emotionally\ncharged and each is united to each by a single associative principle,\nusually the principle of resemblance (Alison 1811, 53–57). The\nawakening of such a train of ideas is commonly known as “the\nseizing of the imagination” and is naturally attended with a\nsimple pleasure (Alison 1811, 8, 103). This pleasure combines with the\npleasure attending the emotion that awakens the train, and with the\npleasures attending the emotions that arise from the ideas\nconstituting the train, to form the complex pleasures attending the\ncomplex emotions of taste, namely, the emotions of beauty and of\nsublimity. The claim that the pleasures of beauty and sublimity are in\nthis way complex is an important one, in that it obviates any need to\nposit a special internal sense by which the pleasures of taste\narise: \nWhen the object of taste is a material object the process by which it\nbecomes pleasurable is more complicated still. The complication is\nthat material objects are not naturally productive of any emotion;\nthey are often naturally productive of simple pleasures and pains, but\nthese are sensations merely. Yet it cannot be doubted that material\nobjects often do produce the complex emotions of beauty and sublimity,\nand so must also produce the simple emotions that initiate unified\ntrains of ideas of emotion. Hence, material objects, in order to\nacquire the capacity to produce the complex pleasures of taste, must\nfirst acquire the capacity to produce simple emotions. They do so,\naccording to Alison, by coming to signify, through association,\nqualities of mind that are naturally productive of emotion (Alison\n1811, 105–107). These include both active and passive qualities\nof mind, \nJust how material qualities come to be associated, and hence to\nsignify, such qualities of mind is a topic Alison considers in great\ndetail, devoting separate and sometimes lengthy chapters to the\nsublimity and beauty of sounds (Alison 1811, 113–163), of colors\n(Alison 1811, 163–176), of forms (Alison 1811, 176–310),\nof motion (Alison 1811, 310–315), and of the human countenance\nand form (Alison 1811, 315–417). \nOf course the doctrine that the beauty of matter derives from the\nbeauty of mind is not new to Alison, who acknowledges a particular\ndebt to Reid: \nWhat is perhaps new, at least to eighteenth-century Britain, is\nAlison’s thorough uncoupling of this Platonic doctrine from that\nof internal sense. \nAlison’s theory of taste, perhaps more than any other here\nconsidered, is apt to strike the present-day aesthetician as alien to\nher concerns. But it is perhaps not so alien. Alison differs from his\npresent-day counterpart by defining the qualities she now terms\n“aesthetic” according to the distinctive emotions he takes\neach to produce. Hence many of Alison’s claims about the\nemotions of beauty and sublimity and about the simple emotions on\nwhich these depend can be translated into claims about aesthetic\nqualities. Consider, for example, the claim—central and\ndistinctive to Alison’s theory—that the emotions of beauty\nand sublimity depend on simple emotions such as delicacy, grace,\ndignity, and majesty. Surely it is a precursor to present-day claims\nabout the dependence—e.g., the supervenience—of\ncomparatively evaluative aesthetic qualities on comparatively\ndescriptive aesthetic qualities.","contact.mail":"shelljr@auburn.edu","contact.domain":"auburn.edu"}]
