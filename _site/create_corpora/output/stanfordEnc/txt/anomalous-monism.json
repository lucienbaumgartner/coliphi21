It claims that\npsychology cannot be a science like basic physics, in that it cannot\nin principle yield exceptionless laws for predicting or explaining\nhuman thoughts and actions (mental anomalism). It also holds that\nthoughts and actions must be physical (monism, or token-identity).\nThus, according to Anomalous Monism, psychology cannot be reduced to\nphysics, but must nonetheless share a physical ontology.\n\n\nWhile neither of these claims, on its own, is novel, their relation,\naccording to Anomalous Monism, is. It is precisely because\nthere can be no such strict laws governing mental events that those\nevents must be identical to physical events. Previous\nidentity theories of mind had held that claims concerning the identity\nof particular mental and physical events (tokens) depended upon the\ndiscovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical properties\n(types). Empirical evidence for psychophysical laws was thus held to\nbe required for particular token-identity claims. Token-identity\nclaims thus depended upon type-identity. Davidson’s position is\ndramatically different—it requires no empirical evidence and\ndepends on there being no lawlike relations between mental\nand physical properties. It in effect justifies the token-identity of\nmental and physical events through arguing for the impossibility of\ntype-identities between mental and physical properties. (For\ndiscussion of philosophical positions related to Anomalous Monism, see\nthe supplement on\n Related Views.)\n \n\nThe appeal of Anomalous Monism is due to these enigmatic features, a\nfairly straightforward argumentative structure, and its attempt to\nbring together an intuitively acceptable metaphysics (monism) with a\nsophisticated understanding of the relation between psychological and\nphysical explanatory schemes (anomalism). Its explicit assumptions are\neach intended, on their own, to be acceptable to positions opposing\nmonism, but, when taken together, to show that monism is in fact\nrequired.\n\nThe basic structure of the argument for Anomalous Monism is as\nfollows. We start with the plausible assumption that some mental\nevents, such as believing that it is raining, are caused by certain\nphysical events, in this case the rain. Similarly, it is assumed that\nsome physical events, such as one’s arm rising, are caused by\ncertain mental events, such as deciding to scratch one’s head.\nDavidson calls this the Principle of Causal Interaction; we shall call\nit the interaction principle: \nThe Interaction Principle: Some mental events causally\ninteract with some physical events \nDavidson presents this assumption as obvious and not in need of\njustification, but we shall see that motivations for it can be found\nin parts of his writings\n (2.2).\n To this interaction principle is added the requirement that all\nsingular causal interactions are covered by strict laws—laws\nwith fully articulated antecedents which guarantee some fully\narticulated consequence (for caveats and details,\n see 3.1).\n Davidson calls this the Principle of the Nomological Character of\nCausality; we shall call it the cause-law principle: \nThe Cause-Law Principle: Events related as cause and effect\nare covered by strict laws \nThis cause-law principle was also initially assumed without argument\nby Davidson, though we shall see below\n (3.2)\n how he later came to try to justify it. Now, the assumptions so far\nseem to point directly to the existence of strict psychophysical\nlaws—if some particular mental event m1 is\ncaused by some particular physical event p1, then,\ngiven the cause-law principle, it seems to follow that there must be a\nstrict law of the form\n‘P1 → M1’.\nThat is, whenever events of kind P1 occur, events\nof kind M1 must follow. However, Davidson then\nclaims that there can be no such laws. He calls this the Principle of\nthe Anomalism of the Mental, and it holds that mental properties are\nnot suitable for inclusion in strict laws of any kind; we shall call\nit the anomalism principle: \nThe Anomalism Principle: There are no strict laws on the\nbasis of which mental events can predict, explain, or be predicted or\nexplained by other events \nDavidson offered loose ruminations concerning rationality and\nrationalizing explanations, which purportedly constitute the very\nnature of mental properties, in support of the anomalism principle\n (4.2).\n All of this will be discussed in detail below. \nWith the interaction principle, the cause-law principle, and the\nanomalism principle now in place, we can see that there is a tension\nin need of resolution. From the interaction and cause-law principles\nit follows that there must be strict laws covering the interaction\nbetween mental and physical events. But the anomalism principle\nentails that there are no strict psychophysical laws. How can all\nthree principles be held simultaneously? \nTo resolve the tension, Davidson noted that while the cause-law\nprinciple requires that there be strict covering laws, it\ndoesn’t specify the vocabulary in which those laws must be\nformulated. If particular physical event p1 causes\nparticular mental event m1, and there must be some\nstrict law covering this interaction, but there is no strict law of\nthe form\n‘P1 → M1’,\nthen there must be some other law,\n‘?1 → ?2’, which\ncovers the causal relation between p1 and\nm1. That is, m1 and\np1 must instantiate properties suitable for\ninclusion in strict laws; but since we know that\nM1 is not a property of this kind,\nm1 must instantiate some other property.\nDavidson’s ingenious deduction at this point was that this\nproperty must be physical, since only the physical sciences hold out\nthe promise of a closed system of strict laws (Davidson 1970,\n223–24; on the notion of a closed system, see\n 5.1\n and the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Monism).\n Therefore, every causally interacting mental event must be\ntoken-identical to some physical event—hence, monism\n (5.1): \nMonism: Every causally interacting mental event is\ntoken-identical to some physical event \nIn arguing in this way, Davidson relies upon a key distinction between\nexplanation and causation. While explanation is, intuitively, an\nintensional notion—one sensitive to how events are\ndescribed—causation is extensional, obtaining between pairs of\nevents independently of how they are described. For example, a\nbridge’s collapse is explained by the explosion of a bomb. That\nexplosion, let us suppose, was the most newsworthy event of the day.\nWhile the most newsworthy event of the day caused the\nbridge’s collapse, ‘the most newsworthy event of the\nday’ does not explain that collapse. Telling someone\nthat it was the most newsworthy event of the day that explained the\nbridge’s collapse wouldn’t provide an explanation—it\nwouldn’t make the bridge’s collapse intelligible to the\naudience—though it would pick out its actual cause. How the\ncause is described is relevant to whether an explanation occurs.\nCauses and effects can be accurately picked out using a variety of\nexpressions, many of which are not explanatory. As we shall see, the\ndistinction between causation and explanation is crucial to Anomalous\nMonism\n (6.1–6.3; \nsee also related discussion of the intensionality\nof deterministic relations in \n Related Issues: 3.1 Anomalous Monism and Kant’s Theory of Freedom).\n \nFinally, to alleviate certain concerns about the adequacy of the form\nof physicalism he was endorsing, Davidson endorsed a dependency\nrelation of supervenience of the mental on the physical, and claimed\nthat it was consistent with Anomalous Monism\n (5.1,\n 5.3) (Davidson 1970, 214; 1993; 1995a, 266): \nSupervenience of the Mental on the Physical: if two events\nshare all of their physical properties, they will share all of their\nmental properties \nIn what follows (2–5), each step of this argument will be\nanalyzed and discussed separately, but always with an eye to the\noverall argument. In 6, a central objection to Anomalous\nMonism—that it appears unable to account for the\ncausal/explanatory power of mental events and properties—will be\nexplained and discussed. (For discussion of the relationship between\nAnomalous Monism and two other pillars of Davidson’s\nphilosophy—his rejection of conceptual relativism and commitment\nto semantic externalism—see the supplement on\n Related Issues.) \nThe interaction principle states that some mental events causally\ninteract with some physical events. In this section we will look\nbriefly at a number of issues related to this principle: how mental\nand physical events are demarcated, the nature of events themselves,\nthe scope of the interaction principle, the relationship between\nmental events and causation, and the use of the interaction principle\nin establishing one component of mental\nanomalism—psychological anomalism, according to which\nthere can be no strict, purely psychological laws. Psychological\nanomalism is to be distinguished from psychophysical\nanomalism, which holds that there can be no strict psychophysical\nlaws. This latter thesis will be explored in detail in our discussion\nof the anomalism principle\n (4). \nDavidson restricts the class of mental events with which Anomalous\nMonism is concerned to that of the propositional\nattitudes—states and events with psychological verbs such as\n‘believes’, ‘desires’, ‘intends’\nand others that subtend ‘that-’ clauses, which relate\nsubjects to propositional contents such as ‘it is raining\noutside’. Anomalous Monism thus does not address the status of\nmental events such as pains, tickles and the\nlike—‘conscious’ or sentient mental events. It is\nconcerned exclusively with sapient mental events—thoughts with\npropositional content that appear to lack any distinctive\n‘feel’. \nThough traditional and intuitive, this way of dividing up the domain\nof the mental isn’t without controversy. Generally, Davidson\nexpresses some skepticism about the possibility of formulating a clear\nand general definition of the class of mental phenomena (Davidson\n1970, 211). And he is suspicious about the idea of mental states given\nto, but uninterpreted by, concepts (Davidson 1974a), which is how\nphilosophers have often thought of conscious phenomena. But for\ncurrent purposes the class of propositional attitudes will suffice as\na criterion for the mental. One key reason for so limiting the reach\nof Anomalous Monism, as we shall see\n (4.2),\n is that it is the rational status of the relevant mental\nevents that Davidson usually cites as responsible for mental\nanomalism. Conscious events have traditionally been thought to occur\nin non-rational animals, a position with which Davidson shows some\nsympathy (Davidson 1985a). Such events thus appear to fall outside of\nthe domain of the rational, and thus outside of the purview of\nDavidson’s argument. \nDavidson is even less helpful about offering a criterion for the\n‘physical’ (Davidson 1970, 211). One half-hearted attempt\ncomes in the statement that \n[p]hysical theory promises to provide a comprehensive closed system\nguaranteed to yield a standardized, unique description of every\nphysical event couched in a vocabulary amenable to law. (Davidson\n1970, 224)  \nThis is at best a promissory note about some future language of\n‘physics’—the ‘true’ physics—and\nit incorporates a requirement of the causal closure of the physical\ndomain that creates problems for certain aspects of Anomalous Monism\n(see the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Anomalous Monism).\n It is probably best to take a ‘physical’ description\nsimply to be one that occurs in the language of a future science that\nis similar to what we call ‘physics’ today but with none\nof its inadequacies. One important component of such descriptions is\ntheir capacity to figure in strict laws of nature (see\n 3.1).\n While this is non-negotiable for physical terms, it is an open\nquestion for mental terms, and Davidson will be arguing\n (4)\n for a negative answer. \nWhen Davidson first argued for Anomalous Monism he subscribed to a\ncausal criterion of event-individuation, according to which two events\n(event-descriptions) are identical (co-refer) if they share all the\nsame causes and effects (Davidson 1969). He much later came to reject\nthat criterion in favor of one according to which events are identical\nif and only if they occupy the same spatiotemporal region (Davidson\n1985b). The difference between these views will not, however, be\nreflected in our discussion. It does not appear to affect either the\nderivation or the essential nature of Anomalous Monism. For our\npurposes, Davidson’s central claims are that what makes an event\nmental (or physical) is that it has a mental (or physical)\ndescription, and the extensionalist thesis that events are concrete\nentities that can be described in many different ways (‘the\nflipping of the light switch’, ‘the illuminating of the\nroom’ and ‘the alerting of the burglar that someone is\nhome’ can all pick out the same one event in different terms).\n(For controversies concerning extensionalism, see\n 5.2\n and the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism).) \nThe interaction principle states that at least some mental events\ncause and are caused by physical events (Davidson 1970, 208). This\nleaves open the possibility of mental events that do not causally\ninteract with physical events. However, given Davidson’s early\nviews about event-individuation (the causal criterion) it is unclear\nthat this possibility can be realized. His later views on\nevent-individuation appear to leave this possibility open, but his\ngeneral claims about the causal individuation of mental contents and\nattitudes (see\n 4.3\n and\n 6.3\n below) also stand in some tension with this possibility. In any case,\nDavidson goes on to say that he in fact believes that all mental\nevents causally interact with physical events (Davidson 1970, 208),\nbut he restricts his argument only to those that actually do. Given\nthe pressures just noted in favor of the inclusive reading of the\ninteraction principle, we shall assume it in what follows. \nThe interaction claim itself should be understood as follows: some\nevents that have a mental description or instantiate a mental property\ncause and are caused by events that have a physical description or\ninstantiate a physical property. Formulating the interaction principle\nin this way both clears the way for an extensional reading of the\ncausal relation (events are causally related no matter how they are\ndescribed), and also leaves open the possibility, which Davidson will\nsubsequently argue for, that mental events in particular must have\nsome non-mental description/instantiate some non-mental property. At\nthis stage that possibility is left as an open question, but it is\nimportant to notice that for it to be an open question we need to at\nleast allow for a distinction between events and the ways in which\nthey are picked out in language. \nThough this will be focused on separately below\n (6),\n it is also important to recognize that we are beginning with the\nassumption that mental events cause and are caused by physical events.\nMany critics of Anomalous Monism have claimed that it is difficult to\nsee how the position avoids epiphenomenalism—the view that\nmental events are causally/explanatorily impotent—and that\nAnomalous Monism is therefore unacceptable as an account of the place\nof the mental in the physical world. However, since Anomalous Monism\nis based upon the interaction principle, Davidson can claim\nin response that if Anomalous Monism is true, then mental events are\nalready known to have a kind of causal efficacy. As we shall see, this\npoint is not by itself sufficient to ward off all epiphenomenalist\nconcerns about Anomalous Monism. But it does serve to remind us of the\nfull framework within which challenges to Anomalous Monism must be\nassessed, and in particular brings out the reliance of that framework\non specific assumptions about causality (see Sections\n 4.3,\n 6, and Yalowitz 1998a). \nWhat needs to be noted at this point is that Davidson argued early on\nfor the claim that mental events have causal efficacy, through noting\na problem for non-causal accounts of action explanation (Davidson\n1963). Mental events and states explain action by making it\nintelligible—rational—in light of the agent’s\nbeliefs and purposes. The challenge that Davidson raised for\nnon-causal theories of action explanation was to account for the fact\nthat, for any action performed, there may well be a large number of\nmental events and states true of the agent, and capable of\nrationalizing the action, but that don’t thereby\nexplain that action. The agent acted because of some\nspecific beliefs and purposes, but other beliefs and purposes of his\ncould just as easily rationalize that action, and thus be cited in its\nexplanation. Was the agent moving his hand as he did because he wanted\nto swat the fly, relieve a cramp, or wave in greeting? He may well\nhave wanted to achieve all three of these aims, but still only in fact\nperformed the action because of one of these reasons. How do\nwe understand ‘because’ so as to rule out the pretenders?\nDavidson’s claim was that it is only if we understand\n‘because’ as ‘was caused by’ that we can\njustifiably pick out the genuine explanans—thereby\nimputing causal potency to mental events. \nWhat exactly does this argument show? It is intended to tell against\nnon-causal theories of action, which deny that reasons explain actions\nby causing them. There have been sophisticated attempts, on the behalf\nof non-causal theories of action explanation, to respond to this\nchallenge (von Wright 1971; Wilson 1985; Ginet 1995; for a good\noverview, see Stoutland 1976; and see related discussion in\n 6.3.)\n However, assuming the argument is successful, while it does establish\nmental efficacy of a kind, it does not by itself establish the\ninteraction principle. Establishing that reasons explain actions by\ncausing them, and that therefore reasons causally interact with\nactions, does not establish that reasons causally interact\nwith physical events. Dualists who reject the identity of\nmental and physical events will surely object. \nA key point to grasp in many of the issues raised by Anomalous Monism\nis that there is an important distinction between action and behavior.\nAccording to Davidson, action is intentionally described\nbehavior—the moving of a hand through space in a certain way\nmay, but need not, be an action of waving or swatting or any action at\nall. It may simply be mere bodily behavior—as happens as the\nresult of a muscle twitch or a strong gust of wind. The behavior must\nbe caused by an agent’s beliefs and desires in order to be\naction. However, while this is necessary for action, it is not,\naccording to Davidson, sufficient. The behavior must be caused in\nthe right way by the beliefs and desires. Davidson notes the\npossibility of cases where an agent’s beliefs and desires cause\nbehavior which is not rationalized by those states, and thus not\naction. A mountain climber might become so unnerved by his desire to\nrid himself of an annoying second climber sharing his rope and belief\nthat jiggling the rope is a means for doing so that he unintentionally\njiggles the rope, leading to the loss of the second climber. This is\nnot an action—it is mere behavior that happens to him, no\ndifferent than if caused by a muscle twitch or gust of wind. It is\ncaused in the wrong way—a “deviant causal\nchain”—by the belief and desire, and so is not an action.\nDavidson is skeptical about the possibility of cashing out what it\nmeans to be caused in the right way (Davidson 1973b,\n78–9), for reasons relating to mental anomalism (Davidson 1973b,\n80; see\n 4\n for explicit discussion). The key point for now is that because\nDavidson rejects the possibility of analyzing action in terms of\nbehavior caused in a particular way by reasons, the point made by the\n‘because’ argument cannot be used to establish that mental\nevents cause physical events. It does not follow from the fact that\nreasons must cause actions in order to explain them that\nreasons must cause behavior or (the interaction principle)\nthat reasons do cause behavior. It does not entail that\nactions are physical behavior. \nThis point is important when one considers the wider framework to\nwhich the interaction principle contributes. Since Davidson is\nattempting to derive monism from it and other principles that are\nthemselves neutral about the metaphysics of mind, he cannot assume\nthat action is (identical with) behavior on pain of circularity. Once\nmonism has been established, Davidson will be in a position to deploy\nthe ‘because’ point in order to argue for the claim that\nmental events are causally efficacious with respect to physical\nevents. How this relates to the wave of epiphenomenalist criticism\nabout Anomalous Monism will be explored in detail below\n (6,\n and see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance).\n To summarize, the interaction principle is an unargued assumption in\nthe Davidsonian framework, one that does not assume monism, and the\n‘because’ argument, while important for ruling out\nnon-causal theories of action, does not itself establish the\ninteraction principle. \nDavidson uses the interaction principle to establish directly one part\nof mental anomalism—psychological anomalism, which\ndenies the possibility of strict, purely psychological laws of the\nform\n‘M1 & M2 → M3’\n(Davidson 1970, 224; 1974b, 243). For if physical events causally\nimpact on mental events, then the mental domain is ‘open’,\nand any laws in which mental predicates figure will have to take this\ninto account (for related discussion, see the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Anomalous Monism).\n More generally, physical conditions will always play some role in any\nplausible psychological generalizations, because physical intervention\n(e.g., injury) is always a possibility and can prevent the occurrence\nof the consequent ‘M3’. Thus, the only\npotentially true and strict laws in which psychological\npredicates can figure are variants of the psychophysical form\n‘P1 & M1 & M2 → M3’.\nPsychophysical anomalism, the other component of mental\nanomalism and the one that denies the possibility of such strict laws,\nis thus the view that Davidson focuses on establishing. \nThe cause-law principle states that events related as cause and effect\nare covered by strict laws. In the earliest formulations of Anomalous\nMonism, Davidson assumed but did not argue for this principle. His\nlater argument in support of it will be considered below\n (3.2),\n along with objections to the principle\n (3.3).\n But we need to consider the nature of the requirement contained in\nthis claim, and how it relates to the framework out of which Anomalous\nMonism is deduced. \nThe nature of the strict laws required by the cause-law principle is\nas follows. For any causal relationship between particular events\ne1 and e2, there must be a law\nof the form\n‘(C1 & D1) → D2’,\nwhere ‘C1’ states a set of standing\nconditions, and ‘D1’ is a description\nof e1 that is sufficient, given\nC1, for the occurrence of an event of the kind\n‘D2’, which is a description of\ne2. Traditionally, a strict law has been thought\nof as one where the condition and event-types specified in the\nantecedent are such as to guarantee that the condition or\nevent-types specified in the consequent occur—the latter\nmust occur if the former in fact obtain. But indeterministic\nor probabilistic versions of strict laws are possible as well\n(Davidson 1970, 219). The point that distinguishes strict laws is not\nso much the guaranteeing of the effect by satisfaction of the\nantecedent as the inclusion, in the antecedent, of all conditions and\nevents that can be stated that could possibly prevent the\noccurrence of the effect. A strict indeterministic law would\nbe one that specified everything required in order for some effect to\noccur. If the effect does not occur when those conditions obtain,\nthere is nothing else that could be cited in explanation of this\nfailure (other than the brute fact of an indeterministic universe).\nFor reasons of simplicity, we will assume determinism in this\ndiscussion, though what is said about strict laws could be carried\nover without remainder to strict indeterministic laws. \nThe cause-law principle is aimed, in the first instance, at laws of\nsuccession, which cover singular causal relationships between\nevents at distinct times. However, as will become clearer below,\nmental anomalism also takes in bridge laws that would\ncorrelate simultaneous instantiations of mental and physical\npredicates as well—such as\n‘P1 → M1’,\n‘M1 → P1’,\nor\n‘P1 ↔ M1’.\nIndeed, mental anomalism rejects the possibility of any\nstrict law in which mental predicates figure (where those predicates\nfigure essentially, and are not redundant)—including (as we have\nseen\n (2.3))\n laws formulated with purely mental predicates\n(‘(M1 & M2) → M3’),\nas well as laws with mental predicates in either the antecedent or\nconsequent, such as\n‘(M1 & M2) → P1’\nand\n‘(P1 & P2) → M1’\nand mixed variants of these (see\n 4). \nThe denial of strict laws of these forms is consistent with allowing\nhedged versions of them which are qualified by a ceteris\nparibus clause. ‘All things being equal’ or\n‘under normal conditions’, such psychological and\npsychophysical generalizations can, according to Davidson, be\njustifiably asserted (Davidson 1993, 9). As will be discussed below\n (4),\n denying the strict version of these generalizations amounts to\ndenying that the qualifying clause ‘ceteris\nparibus’ can be fully explicated. That is,\n‘ceteris paribus,\n((M1 & \nM2) → P1)’\ncannot be transformed into something like\n‘(P2 & P3 & \nM1 & M2 & M3) → \nP1’ (for a related discussion of this\nparticular issue, see the debate between Schiffer 1991 and Fodor\n1991). \n(Davidson organizes his discussion of this transformation process, and\nAnomalous Monism more generally, around a distinction between\n‘homonomic’ and ‘heteronomic’ generalizations\n(Davidson 1970, 219). That distinction is extremely problematic for\nthe purposes of establishing Anomalous Monism, and is set aside here\nin favor of the related (but by no means identical) distinction\nbetween strict and ceteris paribus generalizations. For\ndiscussion of the former distinction, see the supplement on\n Homonomic and Heteronomic Generalizations.) \nDavidson argues for the cause-law principle—that singular causal\nrelations require strict covering laws—on the basis of a\nconceptual interconnection between the concepts of physical\nobject, event and law. As he says, “our\nconcept of a physical object is the concept of an object whose changes\nare governed by laws” (Davidson 1995a, 274). The\ninterconnections are established partly in response to C.J.\nDucasse’s attempt, in reaction to Hume’s regularity theory\nof causation, to define singular causal relations without appeal to\ncovering laws (Ducasse 1926). \nSimply put, Ducasse defined some particular event c as the\ncause of some effect e if and only if c was the only\nchange occurring in the immediate environment of e just prior\nto e. The striking of the match is the cause of the flaming\nmatch just insofar as the striking is the only change occurring in the\nimmediate vicinity of the flaming match just prior to the flaming of\nthe match. Ducasse intended this definition to rebut Hume’s\nclaim that singular causal relations between particular events must be\nanalyzed in terms of regularities between types of events (and thus\nlaws). Indeed, Ducasse claimed that Hume was wrong to deny that we\nhave the ability to perceive singular causal relations—this\ndenial being the basis for Hume’s subsequent regularity account\n (see 3.3).\n For, according to Ducasse, we can perceive that some event is the\nonly change in the immediate environment of some subsequent event just\nprior to that event’s occurrence. (We can, of course, be wrong\nin thinking that this is what we have in fact perceived. But as\nDucasse points out, the same problem plagues Hume’s own\naccount—we can be wrong that what we have perceived are\ninstances of types which bear a regular relation to each other. But\nthis does not lead Hume to hold that since we can’t infallibly\nperceive that some succession is an instance of a regularity, we\ncannot form the concept of causality in terms of regularity. The same\nthus applies to Ducasse’s own account.) \nDavidson notes the heavy dependence, in Ducasse’s account, on\nthe notion of a ‘change’. And he asks whether we really\nhave a purchase on this concept absent appeal to laws. There are two\naspects of this concern. First, the notion of ‘change’ is\nshort for ‘change of predicate’—a change occurs when\na predicate true of some object (or not true of that object) ceases to\nbe true (or comes to be true) of that object. And this leads directly\nto questions about how predicates are individuated and their\nrelationship to laws (see below). Second, and at a more general level,\nthe notion of ‘change’ has itself changed over\ntime—for instance, Newtonian mechanics defines a change\ndifferently than Aristotelian physics, so that continuous motion\ncounts as a change, and thus requires an explanation, according to the\nlatter but not the former. Thus, the very notion of\n‘change’ is theory dependent, and therefore (Davidson\nholds) presupposes the notion of ‘law’, in the sense that\nsomething counts as a change, and thus as having a cause, only against\na background of theoretical principles. \nThis second point does not appear to deliver the result Davidson is\nafter—establishing that each causal interaction must be covered\nby a particular strict law. The claim that something is a change, and\nthus has a cause, only if certain theoretical assumptions are in place\nis consistent with the claim that those assumptions (for instance,\nthat uniform rectilinear motion does not count as a change) cannot\nplay the explanatory role for specific causal interactions that strict\nlaws are supposed to play. They are simply of too general a\nnature—they don’t enable predictions or explanations of\nany particular events. And in any case, there appears to be nothing in\nDavidson’s considerations here that forces the requirement that\nthe covering laws be strict as opposed to irreducibly ceteris\nparibus. (As we have already seen\n (3.1),\n Davidson himself has insisted upon the legitimacy and ubiquity of\nsuch laws in scientific explanation.) \nReturning to the first point about predicate-individuation, Davidson\nclaims that “it is just the predicates which are projectible,\nthe predicates that enter into valid inductions, that determine what\ncounts as a change” (Davidson 1995a, 272). We know from Nelson\nGoodman’s ‘new riddle of induction’ (Goodman 1983)\nthat we can invent predicates, such as ‘grue’ and\n‘bleen’ (where an object is grue if it is green and\nexamined before 2020 or otherwise blue, and an object is bleen if it\nis blue and examined before 2020 or otherwise green) so that a green\nobject goes from being grue to bleen over the course of time without\nhaving changed in any intuitive sense. It will continue to be green,\nthough it will also be true that it ceases to be grue and comes to be\nbleen. Contrary to much discussion of Goodman’s riddle, Davidson\nholds that such unusual predicates can be projectible, and figure in\nlaws, but only when appropriately paired with other such predicates (\n“All emeralds are grue” is not lawlike, but “All\nemerires are grue” is (where “emerire” is true of\nemeralds examined before 2020 or otherwise sapphires ). What is\ncrucial for Davidson is that to understand the notion of change, which\nis so closely tied to the notion of causation, one must understand the\nnotion of a projectible predicate—one appropriate for use in\nscience—and this notion inevitably brings in the notion of law.\nChanges are described by predicates suitable for inclusion within\nlaws. But how does this relate to the cause-law principle? Once again,\nit is unclear why Davidson would think that it is the notion of a\nstrict law in particular that this line of argument\nmotivates. \nA related line of argument that Davidson offers (see\n 4.3)\n appears to suggest that dispositional predicates—those defined\nin terms of the effects they tend to bring about—are not\nsuitable for inclusion in strict laws (generalizations in which they\nfigure are always qualified by a ceteris paribus clause), but\nthere must be strict laws at the bottom, so to speak, of the\ndispositional vocabulary. Davidson’s discussion of this issue\nrefers back to an older debate about the status of dispositional\nterms—specifically, whether they are ‘place-holders’\nfor predicates that are non-dispositional (‘intrinsic’ or\n‘manifest’) (see Goodman 1983, 41ff). Whatever one’s\nview about that issue, it again does not appear that Davidson has\nprovided adequate argument for establishing that strict laws\n(as opposed to ceteris paribus laws) are required for our\ndispositional vocabulary to operate as it does. So Davidson does not\nappear to have provided the cause-law principle with a plausible\nrationale (for skepticism about the principle, see Anscombe 1971,\nCartwright 1983, McDowell 1985, Hornsby 1985 and 1993, and\n 3.3 below).\n This is not to say that it is false, or even that it is implausible\nto assume it in his argument for Anomalous Monism. Many find the\nprinciple highly intuitive, and it is worthwhile to explore its\nrelation to the other central claims in Davidson’s\nframework. \nThe cause-law principle has come in for a lot of criticism since it\nreceived its canonical formulation in Hume’s regularity theory\nof causation, and it is worth briefly reviewing some of the central\nobjections relevant to Davidson’s own discussions. This will\nmake clear how important it is, for an argument such as\nDavidson’s for Anomalous Monism, that some justification for the\nthesis ultimately be provided. \nAn initial objection is that Hume’s analysis of singular causal\nstatements (‘a caused b’ is true if and\nonly if ‘whenever an A occurs, it is followed by an\noccurrence of a B’), which articulates his own version\nof the cause-law principle, is not an accurate rendering of the way in\nwhich we typically use the term ‘cause’. We are confident\nin judgments such as ‘Harry’s smoking caused his lung\ncancer’ while knowing that in fact not all smokers are stricken\nby lung cancer. This point is entirely general—we make singular\ncausal judgments all the time without believing in (indeed, while\nknowing the falsity of) the associated universal generalization (see\nAnscombe 1971). However, Davidson’s extensionalism about\ncausality provides a straightforward response to this concern. His\nview is that while we may not believe in the associated universal\ngeneralization, that is consistent with there being some\nuniversal generalization, stated in a different vocabulary than the\nsingular causal statement, which ‘covers’ that statement.\n(It is worth noting that Davidson rejects Hume’s\nanalysis of singular causal statements in terms of universal\ngeneralizations—he holds that the requirement of such a covering\ngeneralization is necessary but not sufficient for the truth of such a\nstatement (Davidson 1967).) \nWhile this response does appear to meet the objection, it raises the\nfollowing concern, which is behind a related objection to the\ncause-law principle: no one in fact seems to know any true predictive\n‘strict’ laws (in the literal sense of that term). Now,\nwhile it is certainly consistent with this point that there are or\neven must be such laws, it becomes more pressing to know why we should\nthink this if we cannot even offer any examples. It is well and good\nfor Davidson to point to the possibility of strict covering laws that\ntranscend our current knowledge, but we need to know why we should\nbelieve in such things. Science seems to have done well for itself\nwithout any apparent use of them. \nAnother objection to the cause-law principle comes from the state of\ncontemporary physics. According to quantum mechanics, it is not simply\ndifficult or impossible for us to state such laws for quantum\nphenomena. Rather, quantum theory appears to entail that determinism\nfails to obtain at the level of microparticles. What the theory and\nthe behavior of such particles tells us is that causation, at least at\nthe level of micro phenomena, is indeterministic. And this\nindeterminism is claimed to be inconsistent with the requirement of\nstrict laws. This objection to the cause-law principle, then, is that\nphilosophy should never dictate to science on empirical matters.\nObservation of the world tells us that strict laws are impossible in\nthis domain even while causation is present, in direct contradiction\nof the cause-law principle. \nNow, we have already seen Davidson’s own response to this sort\nof objection\n (3.1).\n As traditionally construed, strict laws are supposed to guarantee the\nconsequent condition on the basis of the antecedent condition. But\nthey do not need to provide such a guarantee. What strict laws require\nis that the antecedent include all conditions and events that could\npossibly prevent the occurrence of the consequent. If the consequent\ndoes not occur when all these conditions have been accounted for,\nthere is nothing else to be cited in explanation of the non-occurrence\nother than the sheer brute fact of an indeterministic universe. So\nindeterministic causation is entirely consistent with the cause-law\nprinciple (Davidson 1970, 219). The determinist/indeterminist and\nstrict/nonstrict law distinctions do not map neatly onto each other.\nAn indeterministic law can be universal, exceptionless and true. This\npoint does not appear to be recognized by central proponents of the\nindeterministic objection to strict laws (see Cartwright 1983). \nA final objection to the cause-law principle which is more internal to\nthe wider framework of Anomalous Monism has been put forth in McDowell\n1985. McDowell sees a tension between Davidson’s allegiance to\nthe cause-law principle and his rejection of ‘the dualism of\nscheme and content’ (Davidson 1974a). Briefly, the dualism\nDavidson opposes is the idea that, for instance, a perceptual judgment\nis the rational upshot of an interaction between a concept and an\nnonconceptualized experiential element—the sensory input. Given\nDavidson’s systematic rejection of this idea, McDowell believes\nhe ought to disavow the cause-law principle. McDowell doesn’t\nthink the principle is required for a minimal version of materialism\n(see the supplement on\n Related Views\n (Bare Materialism), and without the need to justify materialism\nMcDowell sees the principle as lacking any motivation in\nDavidson’s framework. For discussion of this issue and others\nrelated to scheme-content dualism and Anomalous Monism, see the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues\n (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism). \nThe anomalism principle states that there are no strict laws on the\nbasis of which mental events can predict, explain, or be predicted or\nexplained by other events. In this section we look at different\ninterpretations of the argument for this principle. Davidson’s\nown formulations, while suggestive, are notoriously vague and often\nappeal to very different sorts of considerations, including aspects of\nlanguage and interpretation, questions about psychological\nexplanation, and the nature of causality and dispositions. We shall be\nlooking at specific interpretations as well as the problems they face\nin providing a compelling rationale for both the anomalism principle\nand Anomalous Monism. \nWhile differing in important ways, the various formulations of the\nargument, as well as the objections to them, exhibit a discernible\npattern: proponents of mental anomalism highlight some feature of\nmental properties that is claimed to (1) sharply individuate them from\nphysical properties and (2) create a conceptual tension with physical\nproperties that precludes the possibility of strict lawful relations\nbetween these properties. According to the objections, however, the\nhighlighted feature of mental properties either does not serve to\ndistinguish it from physical properties or does not actually stand in\nany conceptual tension with physical properties that rules out lawlike\nrelations. We will consider each interpretation, and its problems, in\nturn. In a later section\n (5.3)\n we will look at another objection related to the anomalism\nprinciple—that it is inconsistent with Davidson’s\ninvocation of the doctrine that mental properties stand in a relation\nof supervenience to physical properties. For discussion of the\nrelation between the anomalism principle and Davidson’s views\nabout scheme-content dualism and semantic externalism, see the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues. \nMental anomalism, as initially formulated by Davidson, holds that\nthere can be no strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be\npredicted and explained (Davidson 1970, 208). It is thus restricted to\nruling out strict laws of succession with mental predicates occurring\nin the consequent—laws such as\n‘P1 → M1’,\n‘(M1 & P1) → M2’,\nor\n‘M1 → M2’.\nIt thus denies that the occurrence of particular mental events such as\ncoming to believe or intend something, or intentionally acting in some\nway, can be explained by appeal to strict covering laws. But as\nbecomes clear, Davidson’s considered position rejects the\npossibility of any strict laws in which mental predicates\nfigure—and this includes, in particular, bridge laws of the form\n‘P1 ↔ M1’,\nwhich form the basis of type-identity theories of mind, as well as any\nstrict laws with mental antecedents. We have already seen how strict\npurely psychological laws are ruled out by the interaction principle\n (2.3).\n And, at a more general level, it rules out purported solutions to the\nproblem of deviant causal chains noted in\n 2.2,\n which would spell out, in terms of some required physical and also,\nperhaps, mental conditions, how behavior must be caused by reasons\n(“caused in the right way”) in order to be action. (That\nsome physical conditions are necessary in such an analysis is\nguaranteed, as we have seen\n (2.3),\n by the open nature of the mental and subsequent psychological\nanomalism.) Any such adequate analysis of action would entail\nparticular psychophysical laws of the form\n‘(M1 & M2 & M3 & P1) → P2’.\nFor such an analysis would state that whatever behavior\n(P2) which in fact is caused in the right way\n(M3 & P1) by\nreasons\n(M1 & M2) would\nbe the action that is rationalized by those reasons. This\nprovides a schema for generating strict psychophysical laws: by\nplugging in particular reasons and the causal conditions\nP1 and M3 proffered by the\nanalysis, we get a strict predictive psychophysical law simply by\nnoting what effect is produced by these causes. (In the course of an\nextended discussion of the problem of deviant causal chains, Bishop\n1989, 125–75, fails to see this connection between it and mental\nanomalism—see 164.) With strict purely psychological laws thus\nalready ruled out, the focus now is on strict psychophysical laws. \nIt is useful to view Davidson’s attack against psychophysical\nlaws in light of an argument, in vogue in the 1950s and 1960s, against\nthe claim that reasons are causes of the actions they explain. This\nargument was referred to as the “Logical Connection\nArgument” (see Stoutland 1970). According to this argument,\nreasons cannot be held to explain actions by causing them because (1)\ncauses and effects must be logically distinct from each other (one of\nHume’s requirements on causality) but (2) reasons and the\nactions they explain bear a quasi-logical connection to each other, by\nvirtue of the rationalizing relation between them. That relationship\nis quasi-logical because not just any reason can explain any\naction—only those reasons which actually rationalize (make\nintelligible) an action can explain it. Davidson’s own\ninfluential response to this argument was to distinguish between\ncausal relations, which obtain between events no matter how they are\ndescribed, and logical relations, which obtain between particular\ndescriptions of events. The Logical Connection Argument fails to\nrecognize this simple distinction. The distinction allowed Davidson to\nmerge two key ideas in his theory of action—that reasons explain\nby causing, and that they explain by rationalizing (Davidson 1963,\n13–17). As we shall see below, however, Davidson appears to\naccept a basic distinction at the heart of the Logical Connection\nArgument—that the rationalizing relationship bears a certain key\nproperty (quasi-logical status) that is at odds with the relationship\nbetween physically described, causally related events. \nDavidson’s explicit considerations in favor of mental anomalism\nappeal to factors about the interpretation of action (linguistic as\nwell as non-linguistic) and the ascription of mental states and events\nto persons. Several distinguishable features are noted—holism\nwith respect to particular ascriptions, indeterminacy with respect to\nsystematic interpretative frameworks, and the responsiveness of mental\nascription to an ideal of rationality. According to holism, particular\nmental states can be cited in explanation of behavior only in the\ncontext of other mental states, which in turn depend upon others.\nDavidson claims that this dependency and holistic interrelatedness is\n“without limit” (Davidson 1970, 217). This echoes a\nrelated point he makes about the impossibility of definitional\nreduction of mental states in purely behavioristic terms, because of\nthe ineliminable need for mental caveats (e.g., that the person\nunderstands, or notices or cares….) qualifying any attempt to\nstate non-mental conditions for mental states. \nDavidson presents these claims about definitional reduction as facts\nwhich “provide at best hints of why we should not expect\nnomological connections between the mental the physical”\n(Davidson 1970, 217). If definitional reduction of this kind were in\nfact impossible, it would rule out the possibility of a subclass of\nstrict psychophysical laws—those relating mental states with\nnon-intentionally described behavior—but the basis for this\nimpossibility would not have been explained. In fact, however, without\nknowing what that basis is supposed to be, we have no reason to accept\nDavidson’s claim that definitional reduction is indeed\nimpossible. What prevents us from articulating all the required\ncaveats? Without a rationale in hand, nothing prevents a reductionist\nfrom simply offering us detailed definitions and challenging us to\ncome up with counterexamples. Something both principled and convincing\nis clearly needed. Davidson’s concerns about definitional\nreduction are ‘hints’ concerning nomological reduction\nonly in the sense that they draw out our intuitions about something\nstanding in the way of formulating such laws. What that obstacle is\nneeds clear formulation. \nAt times, Davidson appeared to flirt with the idea that the missing\nlink was provided by the thesis of the indeterminacy of translation,\ndeveloped by W.V Quine (1960) and endorsed by Davidson (1970, 222;\n1979). This thesis claims that there are empirically adequate but\nnon-equivalent complete frameworks for assigning linguistic meanings\nand mental states to a person on the basis of his behavior, and that\nthere is no fact of the matter that determines that one but not other\nsuch frameworks is correct. In particular, there are no physical\nfacts, inside a person’s body or head or outside in the external\nworld, that could settle whether a person’s words refer to some\ndeterminate range of objects rather than some other range, or whether\none rather than another systematically interdependent set of mental\nstates, with distinct distributions of truth values, is true of that\nperson (see Davidson 1979). If the indeterminacy thesis is true, then\non the face of it there would be some rationale for rejecting the\npossibility of psychophysical laws. For if all physical facts are\nconsistent with different psychological/semantic assignments, then it\nseems that knowing all the physical facts could not tell us whether\nsome mental states were true of some person, or some meaning true of\nher words—neither could be exceptionlessly predicted or\nexplained, just as mental anomalism maintains. \nThere are two problems with this, however. First, this would do\nnothing to rule out certain psychophysical laws, such as those of the\nform\n‘M1 → P1’.\nAnd so it couldn’t ground the completely general thesis\nof mental anomalism. But more importantly, Davidson himself holds that\nthe least controversial versions of indeterminacy, having to do with\ndiverging reference schemes, amount to mere notational\nvariance—as he puts it, meaning is what is invariant between\nempirically adequate translation schemes (Davidson 1977, 225; 1999a,\n81). And given that such schemes are generated through a purely\nmechanical permutation function (Davidson 1979, 229–30) it is a\nrelatively simple technical trick to take these different schemes into\naccount when formulating psychophysical laws. The laws, for instance,\ncould be formulated with disjunctive predicates\n(‘P1 → (M1 ∨ M2 ∨ M3’).\nOr, if such predicates are considered problematic, the laws could be\nof the form\n‘P1 → M*’,\nwhere ‘M*’ picks out the invariant element\nbetween the empirically equivalent theories. So it is not at all clear\nthat indeterminacy in and of itself is capable of supporting an\nacross-the-board rejection of strict psychological or psychophysical\nlaws. And Davidson ultimately acknowledges this, in stating that\nanomalism would hold even if indeterminacy didn’t (Davidson\n1970, 222). \nWhat is responsible for the possibility of indeterminacy, however, is\nthe role of the principle of charity in formulating a theory of\nanother person’s behavior (Davidson 1970, 222–23). And\nthis principle is closely aligned for Davidson with mental anomalism.\nAccording to this principle, we must “try for a theory that\nfinds him consistent, a believer of truths, and a lover of the good\n(all by our own lights, it goes without saying)” (Davidson 1970,\n222). In the process of coming to understand another, by ascribing\nmental states and events to him and meanings to his words, we must,\nDavidson claims, stand ready to adjust previous assignments of\nmeanings and mental states and events based upon new evidence about\nthe person and how it relates to the overall project of finding him\nand his behavior intelligible. There are two key points here that for\nDavidson suggest mental anomalism. First, we never have all possible\nevidence—we must maintain an openness to better interpretations\nof previous behavior as new evidence becomes available. Interpretation\nis always ongoing. And second, ‘better’ interpretations\nare those made in light of the constitutive ideal of rationality.\nConsequently, Davidson claims,  \nthere cannot be tight connections between the realms [of the mental\nand the physical] if each is to retain allegiance to its proper source\nof evidence. (Davidson 1970, 222) \nRationality is claimed by Davidson to be constitutive of the\nmental in the sense that something only counts as being a\nmind—and thus an appropriate object of psychological\nattributions—if it meets up to certain rational standards. This\nconstitutive idea is open to weaker and stronger interpretations. The\nweaker interpretation sees only very basic logical, semantic or\nconceptual constraints on understanding others—and thus what is\nconstitutive of minds—which allows for significant variation as\none moves further out from these to more substantive principles of\npractical reasoning and theoretical reasoning, and even more when\nextending out further to desires and values. The stronger\ninterpretation appears to be suggested in the quote from Davidson\nimmediately above. In requiring consistency, true beliefs and\nappropriate desires, it appears to require maximizing agreement\nbetween interpreter and interpreted, and thus a maximal conception of\nwhat is constitutive of minds. The weaker interpretation instead\nrequires merely minimizing inexplicable error on the part of the\ncreature being interpreted, thus allowing for significant deviations\nfrom psychological assignments that might be required by the stronger\ninterpretation. On this view, the interpreter puts himself into the\nshoes of the interpreted, acknowledging evidential and cognitive\nlimitations that might prevent her from achieving maximal rationality\n(Grandy 1973). As we will see in this section, how one interprets the\nnotion of rationality as constitutive directly affects how the\nargument for mental anomalism is interpreted to work. \nWhile Davidson never offers any substantive account of what the proper\nsource of evidence is for the physical, he often invokes the notion of\nrationality as constraining mental ascription, and it is clear that\nwhatever constrains physical ascription is supposed to pull in a\ndifferent and potentially conflicting direction. One suggestive way of\ngetting at Davidson’s idea here is through the traditional\ndistinction between ‘normative’ and\n‘descriptive’ concepts. When we look to uncover\ngeneralizations in the physically described world, what we find to\nfollow from a certain set of physical conditions is a brute\nfact; our world is constituted in certain ways (in its governing\nlaws) that we could imagine to be different. We may come to an\nempirical investigation with certain theoretical commitments that\ninevitably lead us to read the data in some ways rather than others;\nand there may indeed, as Davidson himself suggests, be constitutive\na priori principles that govern very basic physical concepts\nsuch as ‘object’ and ‘event’ (Davidson 1970,\n220; 1974b, 239; 1973a, 254; see\n 3.2\n above). However, the constraints are far looser and allow for a wide\nvariation in terms of empirical content—of what physical events\nand states can follow from others. This is contrasted with mental\nascription, where the normative notion of rationality rules out the\npossibility of certain mental states following from others. This line\nof thinking is suggestive, but it is in need of considerable\ntightening. \nJaegwon Kim’s account of Davidson’s position (Kim 1985)\nattempts to do just this. Kim argues that if there were strict lawlike\nrelations between mental and physical predicates, the ‘brute\nfactness’ and contingency of the physical would\n‘infect’ the mental. For instance, rationality\nconsiderations will typically lead us to attribute a belief that q to\na person if we attribute a belief that p and also attribute a\nbelief that p entails q. According to Kim’s account, beliefs\ninvolving very basic logical, semantic or conceptual relations like\nthis hold of necessity—we cannot make sense of possible worlds\nwhere beliefs of the first two kinds are attributed but not the\nthird. \nNow, this may appear to be too strong a claim, in light of\nDavidson’s rejection of strict, purely psychological\nlaws—mental anomalism rejects the possibility of any strict laws\nin which mental predicates figure, but Kim here appears to be\ndeploying laws of the form\n‘M1 & M2 → M3’.\nKim would reply that Davidson is only interested in rejecting strict\ndescriptive (i.e., explanatory, predictive) laws, not strict normative\nlaws (see below).  \nIf physical predicates stood in strict lawful relations to mental\npredicates, this contingency would ‘infect’ the mental in\nthe following sense. Suppose that there were strict bridge laws\ncorrelating the instantiation of mental and physical properties,\n‘P1 ↔ M1’\nand\n‘P2 ↔ M2’.\nThen, Kim argues, rational principles of the form\n‘M1 → \nM2’ would enable the logical derivation of\nphysical laws like\n‘P1 → P2’.\nIndeed, the reverse would be true as well; starting with the physical\nlaw\n‘P1 → P2’,\nand assuming the psychophysical bridge laws, one could derive the\nrational principle\n‘M1 → M2’.\nHowever, the metaphysical status of the rational principle and the\nphysical law are importantly different—rational principles are\nnecessary, true in all possible worlds, while physical laws, being\ncontingent, are not. In particular, with the bridge laws in place, a\ncontingent physical law could explain (through derivation) the\nrational principle, undermining its status as necessary. Since it is\nthe bridge laws that enable these troublemaking derivations,\nthey—and thus strict psychophysical laws—are to be\nrejected. This is how Kim makes sense of Davidson’s suggestive\nclaim that mental anomalism is grounded in the fact that mental and\nphysical explanation owe their allegiance to different sources of\nevidence. (For related discussion, see the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.) \nKim’s argument rests upon two central assumptions. First, it\nassumes that no distinction between strict and ceteris\nparibus laws need play any role in reconstructions of\nDavidson’s argument. It is, purportedly, not the scope\nof a psychological law which accounts for an asymmetry with physical\nlaws, but rather the point of each type of law (Kim 1985,\n381). Second, it assumes that there is a firm distinction between\ndescriptive laws and relations, on the one hand, and normative laws\nand relations, on the other, that can bear the weight of mental\nanomalism (Kim 1985, 383) The first assumption is clearly mistaken; as\nalready noted, Davidson heavily emphasizes the focus on strict laws in\nhis own discussions of Anomalous Monism, and explicitly allows for the\npossibility of hedged laws incorporating mental predicates.\nKim’s reductio strategy, then, would fail to uniquely\nidentify the culprit responsible for producing the trouble as the\nbridge laws rather than the rational principle, all of which\nare strict. And while Davidson does emphasize the normative status of\nmental predicates, he also recognizes, as we have already noted\n (3.2\n and\n 4.2),\n a normative component to the physical realm, in constitutive a\npriori principles. There does not appear to be a significant\ndistinction between descriptive and normative principles in\nDavidson’s framework that can bear the burden of mental\nanomalism, as required on Kim’s interpretation. (For further\ndiscussion of Kim’s interpretative strategy, see the supplement\non\n Kim’s Reductio Strategy for Establishing Mental Anomalism.) \nJohn McDowell also focuses on the normative nature of rationality, but\nemphasizes a very strong conception of rationality as an ideal\nconstitutive of the mental, taking in more than merely the familiar\ndeductive relations—logical, semantic or\nconceptual—deployed in Kim’s reading (McDowell 1985,\n391–4). McDowell appears to be guided by some of\nDavidson’s broader formulations and discussions of the principle\nof charity\n (4.2),\n which extend to more general principles governing action and belief\nformation, highlighted in Davidson’s discussions of\nirrationality (see Davidson 1982). For example, the principle of\ncontinence requires one to act on the basis of all available\nconsiderations, and the principle of total evidence requires one to\nbelieve the hypothesis supported by all of one’s evidence. And\nthe broad formulations entail that our conception of rationality\nincludes conceptions of the Good, and so the formation of rationally\nappropriate desires, thus extending beyond constraints on belief and\naction. According to McDowell, those inclined to think that mere\ndeductive relations can be captured in physical terms (see Loar 1981)\nwill find mental anomalism much more difficult to deny when taking\ninto account this stronger conception of rationality.  \nThis stronger conception of rationality puts McDowell in a position to\nexploit a crucial gap between rational norms and actual explanations\nof behavior: \nFinding an action or propositional attitude intelligible, after\ninitial difficulty, may not only involve managing to articulate for\noneself some hitherto merely implicit aspect of one’s conception\nof rationality, but actually involve becoming convinced that\none’s conception of rationality needed correcting, so as to make\nroom for this novel way of being intelligible. (McDowell 1985,\n392) \nJust as our beliefs about empirical matters can be mistaken in any\ngiven case, and we can make genuine discoveries about empirical\nreality, just so with rationality. Clearly this claim is much more\nplausible with the stronger conception of rationality that McDowell is\nurging than the weaker conception limited to mere deductive relations.\nMcDowell goes on to argue that because of this feature, we must be\nopen to the possible reinterpretation of a person’s behavior and\npsychological states in light of our changing conception of\nrationality, and how it changes cannot be anticipated in advance so\nthat rationality could be captured in a permanent set of principles\nfrom which strict laws could be fashioned. For this reason,\nrationality is uncodifiable. According to McDowell, this is\nwhat underlies mental anomalism. \nOne might understand the reasoning here in the following way: because\nit is built into our conception of rationality that our own particular\ngrasp of rationality may be mistaken on any given occasion and is also\ninherently limited, no statement of psychological or psychophysical\ngeneralizations could exhaust, and therefore explain, our conception\nof rationality. If the concept of rationality does not simply\nconsist in one’s conception, at any given time, of\nrationality, then it cannot be captured in terms of the\nactual goings on in one’s brain (the same point applies\nif we substitute “everyone’s” for\n“one’s”). Therefore, strict lawlike relations\nbetween the mental and the physical are impossible. This contrasts\ninterestingly with Kim’s strategy: on McDowell’s reading,\nit is partly because no detailed statement of a rational principle\ncould be claimed to be necessarily true that there can be no\npsychophysical laws. \nA number of questions arise in considering McDowell’s argument.\nIt appears to be heavily influenced by Davidson’s remarks about\nthe ongoing nature of interpretation (Davidson 1970, 223;\n see 4.2).\n However, Davidson appeals to the fact that new\nevidence—in the form of behavior and environmental\ncontext—is always coming in that can force us to revise existing\ninterpretations of an agent. There is no mention of shifting\nstandards, or unarticulated or inarticulable conceptions of\nrationality. Indeed, the implication is that a stable\nstandard, when taking into account new evidence, can lead to revised\ninterpretations of prior behavior. So McDowell appears to be going\nbeyond Davidson’s own views about the concept of rationality.\nIndeed, the idea that one is not able to fully articulate a concept in\nthe way suggested by McDowell—that it is in effect\nineffable –does not clearly sit comfortably with\nDavidson’s views about conceptual relativism and rejection of\nthe idea of untranslatable languages (see further the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism). \nFurther, and more importantly, McDowell’s distinctive\nuncodifiability claim, which rests on this view of rationality, looks\nto be too general to underwrite a specific thesis like mental\nanomalism. This becomes apparent when one asks why the very same\nfeatures that he is insisting are true of our conception of\nrationality aren’t also true of the key concepts that figure in\nexplanations of the physical world. Surely our concepts of physical\nreality outstrip any particular conception we have at any given time,\nand the possibility of mistaken application is built into them. And\nscientists are in the same position as interpreters in terms of the\npossibility of new evidence and its bearing on how previous evidence\nwas understood. So far this looks to be nothing more than a\ncombination of a completely general point about concepts together with\nthe familiar problem of induction, which plagues all empirical\nenquiry. McDowell’s assertion that “someone who aims at\nexplanations of the ideal-involving kind must be alive to the thought\nthat there is sure to be a gap between actual current conception and\nideal structure in his own case as well as others” (McDowell\n1985, 392) doesn’t appear to uniquely pick out any particular\nexplanatory framework. It therefore cannot tell us anything\ndistinctive about the metaphysical status of psychology. \nIf, however, the emphasis here falls on constitutive\nprinciples in particular—as surely it must—then two other\nproblems arise. First, McDowell’s reasoning doesn’t tell\nus what exactly it is about such principles that makes them resistant\nto reduction, since, as we’ve just seen, that reasoning has\nfailed to distinguish them from empirical concepts in the physical\nsciences. And second, as noted in\n 4.2,\n Davidson holds that there are constitutive a priori\nprinciples underlying the physical sciences which play a similar role\nthere that rationality plays in psychological explanation. So we are\nstill in need of an explanation of why psychology and physics cannot\nstand in strict lawlike relations. Now, we did note there that such\nphysical constitutive principles are far more lenient than\nrationality, allowing for a greater variety of empirical\ncontent—of what can follow from what. This indeed accounts for\nan important asymmetry between mental and physical explanation. And\nMcDowell heavily emphasizes this point in his discussion: that it is\nnot merely a brute fact that rationality marks the limits of\nintelligibility, while physical explanations do bottom out in brute\nfacts (McDowell 1985, 394). However, this point appears to be entirely\nseparable from the distinctive feature of McDowell’s reading of\nthe argument for mental anomalism—it has nothing especially to\ndo with the idea of rationality as uncodifiable in\nMcDowell’s specific sense. In fact, it is the key point behind\nKim’s strategy, and it appears to have no essential connection\nto McDowell’s stronger views about rationality. One can think of\nrationality as constitutive, as normative and as asymmetrical to the\nphysical in the way just noted—as Kim does—without buying\ninto McDowell’s distinctive picture of it. So it looks like the\nsalvageable part of McDowell’s actual argument for mental\nanomalism ultimately reduces to Kim’s. Uncodifiability appears\nto be a red herring. \nTherefore, despite McDowell’s extremely subtle and interesting\nviews about the nature of the ideal of rationality, in the end those\nviews do not appear to provide a secure foundation for mental\nanomalism. It is only what is shared in common with Kim’s\nstrategy—the modal asymmetry between rational and physical\nexplanation—that bears directly on mental anomalism. And that\nleaves McDowell’s reading facing the sorts of concerns raised in\n 4.2.1. \nAs we have seen above, Kim thinks that mental anomalism is susceptible\nof a kind of proof. This seems to be something stronger than Davidson\nhimself claims (Davidson 1970, 215). In light of Davidson’s\nmodesty about provability, and lack of explicit argumentation, some\ncommentators (Child 1992; see also McDowell 1979) have suggested that\nmere reflection on the kinds of generalizations that we draw upon in\ncoming to understand each other supports (but cannot prove) mental\nanomalism. Such generalizations are rules of thumb that hold only for\nthe most part, and require, for their application to a given case,\ndetailed contextual supplementation that cannot, by its nature, be\nincluded in anything like a universal generalization. The suggestion\nis that the sheer amount of contextual detail that would need to be\naccounted for in any statement with even a hope of being true is\ninappropriate for inclusion in strict lawful statements. A related\nstrategy is to point to a lack of fixed, predetermined ends that all\nhumans (or even any particular human over the course of her life) aim\nfor in situations of choice, or values to maximize when deciding what\nto believe (such as simplicity, scope, and consistency in the case of\ntheory choice) (Child 1992). The thought here is that if there are no\nsuch fixed ends or values, then no psychological generalization could\nbe complete—since in particular contexts such ends or values\nplay a crucial explanatory role in determining what to do or\nbelieve. \nIt would seem, however, that reflection on the level of detail\nrequired for strict laws in the physical sciences fails to provide for\nan interesting asymmetry here. If one considers the number of factors\nthat would have to be taken in to account in order to state conditions\nthat guarantee that when a match is struck it will produce a flame,\nthe resulting strict law would be quite complex, and in a way not\nobviously different from any putative strict laws in which mental\npredicates figure, with contextual features included. And if there are\nindeed no fixed ends or values in the realm of choice and a decision,\nthis can be accommodated in the same way—the contextual ends or\nvalues could themselves be included in the putative strict laws. This\nwould complicate and expand the set of such laws, but as already noted\nthis is not something that would set mental generalizations apart from\nphysical ones. (For further discussion of rationality and the argument\nfor Anomalous Monism see Yalowitz 1997 and Latham 1999.) \nWe have been looking at different ways of making sense of and\njustifying Davidson’s claim that mental anomalism stems from the\nconstitutive role of rationality in mental ascription. In\nDavidson’s writings, however, another line of argument often\nsurfaces which focuses less on the rational nature of mental events\nand more on their causal nature. As we have already seen, in his\nearliest work on action Davidson argued that reasons explain actions\nby causing them, and he later came to emphasize that what makes mental\nstates and events what they are is determined in part by their causes\nand effects. Particular psychological explanations are causal (they\ninvoke causes—Davidson 1963), and are formulated in terms of\ncausally defined concepts (for propositional attitudes, see Davidson\n1987b, 41; for mental contents, see Davidson 1987a, 44). In later work\nhe frequently notes the anomic nature of causal concepts and causal\nexplanations, and how mental properties and reasons explanations are\nanomic because of this—“reason-explanations…are in\nsome sense low-grade; they explain less than the best explanations in\nthe hard sciences because of their heavy dependence on causal\npropensities” (Davidson 1987b, 42; see also Davidson 1991, 162).\nIf mental concepts are causally defined, and strict laws do not employ\ncausally defined concepts, then mental anomalism appears to follow\nstraight away, without need of any detour through issues concerning\nthe rationality of mental concepts. \nExtending this reasoning, Davidson writes that \n[m]ental concepts…appeal to causality because they are\ndesigned, like the concept of causality itself, to single out from the\ntotality of circumstances which conspire to cause a given event just\nthose factors that satisfy some particular explanatory interest.\n(Davidson 1991, 163) \nThis appears to ground the causal definition of anomic properties\n(whether mental or otherwise) in the fact that they answer to\nparticular explanatory interests. This is contrasted with the case of\n‘ultimate physical’ properties: “Explanation in\nterms of the ultimate physics, though it answers to various interests,\nis not interest relative” (Davidson 1987b, 45). This seems to\ncollapse the distinction between psychology and all the other special\nsciences with respect to the question of anomalism. All of the latter\nanswer to particular explanatory interests, and are thus\nselective with respect to the total sufficient condition for\nan effect-type (see Davidson 1987b, 45); the causal definition, and\nthus anomalism, of their vocabularies is owed to this\ninterest-relativity and selectivity. ‘Ultimate physics’,\non the other hand, “treats everything without exception as a\ncause of an event if it lies within physical reach (falls within the\nlight cone leading to the effect)” (Davidson 1987b, 45). \nDavidson repeats these sorts of claims about the anomic nature of\ncausally defined properties in a number of places in later writings,\nbut at no point does he clearly bring them into contact with his early\nremarks concerning the constitutive role of rationality in\npsychological ascription. And he never provides argument in support of\nthis general thesis concerning causality. It is natural to wonder why,\ngiven this general thesis about causally defined concepts, rationality\nshould be thought to underwrite mental anomalism. And it becomes\nimperative to know why that general thesis is plausible (for\ndiscussion, see Yalowitz 1998a). \nWith regard to the first issue, there is some evidence that Davidson\nis confusing two distinct questions: why mental concepts cannot stand\nin lawlike relation to physical concepts, and why mental concepts\ncannot be eliminated in favor of physical concepts in the explanation\nof human behavior. Given the general thesis about causally defined\nproperties, we have an understanding of why mental concepts are\nanomic. But this leaves open the question whether we ought to continue\nto traffic in anomic concepts generally, and mental concepts in\nparticular. Why not eliminate them in favor of the nomic physical\nconcepts? Here, the rationality of mental concepts may be thought to\nprovide an answer. If we wish to understand why an agent performed the\naction that she did, as opposed to having a full sufficient causal\nexplanation of why her body moved as it did, we are interested in a\nselective explanation—that part of the total sufficient\ncondition that satisfies the particular explanatory interests behind\nreasons-explanations (Davidson 1991, 163). Those interests highlight\nthe normative nature of reason and action—their responsiveness\nto the principle of charity and ideal of rationality. Rationality, on\nthis line of thinking, does not account for mental anomalism; but it\ndoes speak to the question of mental realism (see further\n 6.2).\n (For further discussion of the anomic nature of causally defined\nconcepts and its bearing on Anomalous Monism, see Yalowitz 1998a. For\nmore on the relation between rational explanation and mental realism,\nsee the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.\n For discussion of issues closely related to the causal definition\nargument, see\n 6.3\n and the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism). \nSo far we have looked at Davidson’s three premises in support of\nAnomalous Monism—the interaction, cause-law and anomalism\nprinciples. In this section, we examine the conclusion that Davidson\ndraws on the basis of these principles—the token-identity theory\nof mental events, according to which every causally interacting mental\nevent is token-identical to some physical event. We will look at the\nderivation and nature of this theory, some questions about its\nadequacy, as well as the additional thesis that mental properties\nsupervene on physical properties. As we shall see, both the\ntoken-identity and supervenience claims turn out to be controversial,\nin their motivation as well as in their consistency with mental\nanomalism. One key point to keep in mind at this point is that monism\nis supposed to be derived from the principles and other assumptions\nthat, taken individually, could be acceptable to positions opposing\nmonism. \nTo begin with, it is worth pointing out that Davidson is concerned\nonly with the ontological status of events, and not substances.\nDescartes, for instance, argued for the claim that mind and body are\ndistinct entities. While Descartes’ position has implications\nfor accounts of mental events, the issues concerning event and\nsubstance identity are distinct (see Latham 2001). Davidson clearly\ntakes himself to be establishing something that is inconsistent with\nCartesian dualism, however, and it is useful briefly to look at how\nAnomalous Monism bears upon substance dualism. \nAccording to Descartes, mind and body are distinct substances in part\nbecause they do not share essential properties in common. In\nparticular, minds do not occupy a spatial location, while bodies\nnecessarily do. Since mental events thus constitute changes occurring\nin a nonspatially-located entity, they also do not occupy a spatial\nregion. Bodily events, on the other hand, do occupy spatial locations\nby virtue of being changes in material substances, which themselves\nare spatially located. On Descartes’ view, then, particular\nmental and physical events cannot be token-identical, since they fail\nto share a crucial property in common without which identity is\nunintelligible. While Anomalous Monism is not officially concerned\nwith the ontological status of substances, it thus appears to have\nconsequences that are inconsistent with Descartes’ substance\ndualism—though it doesn’t by itself establish substance\nmonism, it does rule out the Cartesian thought that mental and\nphysical events fail to be identical, and so conflicts with one of the\nbases for Cartesian substance dualism. \nThe structure of Davidson’s derivation of the token-identity of\ncausally interacting mental events with physical events appears to be\nstraightforward: causally interacting mental events (the interaction\nprinciple) must instantiate some strict law property (the cause-law\nprinciple) but mental properties are not suitable for inclusion in\nstrict laws (the anomalism principle). So mental events must\ninstantiate some other property, which is suitable for such inclusion.\nGiven Davidson’s invocation of the causal closure of the\nphysical domain, according to which every physical event has a\nphysical explanation, he moves rather quickly to the conclusion that\nthis other property must be physical, since closure entails that\nphysical properties have a privileged status, which suggests that they\nhold out the promise of strict laws. (Davidson also has a tendency\nsimply to identify as ‘physical’ those properties that\nfigure in strict laws (Davidson 1970, 224; 1995a, 266), but this would\nof course beg the question of mental anomalism.) Consequently,\ncausally interacting mental events must be token-identical with\nphysical events, ruling out Cartesian as well as other forms of\ndualism. \nThere are serious problems with the assumption of causal closure of\nthe physical in Davidson’s framework (for discussion, see the\nsupplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Anomalous Monism).\n It is difficult, however, to see how Davidson can move from the claim\nthat mental events must instantiate non-mental, strict law properties\nto the claim that these properties must be physical without assuming\nclosure. Why assume that only ‘physical’ properties are\nnomic? This raises interesting issues about the nomic status of other\nspecial sciences—the relevant ones here being biology and\nchemistry—but there do not appear to be explicit, conclusive\nresources in Davidson’s own thinking for addressing this.\nYalowitz 1998a has, however, provided an interpretation of Anomalous\nMonism stressing Davidson’s views on causality and the nomic\nstatus of dispositions (see\n 4.3)\n in which causal closure is derived from the\ncause-law principle, token-identity and the anomalism of causally\ndefined properties. On this interpretation, the strict law properties\nthat mental events must instantiate turn out to be physical because\nonly physical properties are non-causally individuated—all\nspecial science properties are causally individuated, and all such\nproperties are anomic. \nDavidson’s token-identity theory is dramatically different than\nprevious identity theories of mind, in both it’s a\npriori status as well as its stance towards the role of laws in\njustifying monism. Previous theories had argued that claims concerning\nthe identity of particular mental and physical events depended upon\nthe discovery of lawlike relations between mental and physical\nproperties. These theories thus held that empirical evidence\nsupporting such laws was required for particular identity claims.\nAccording to Anomalous Monism, however, it is precisely\nbecause there can be no such strict laws that causally\ninteracting mental events must be identical to some physical\nevent. The token-identity thesis thus requires no empirical evidence\nand depends on there being no lawlike relations. It in effect\njustifies the token-identity of mental and physical events through\narguing for the impossibility of type-identities between mental and\nphysical properties or kinds (Davidson 1970, 209, 212–13; see\nJohnston 1985). \nAn important point to recognize in Davidson’s version of\ntoken-identity is that he is not simply deriving the conclusion that\nmental events bear some property that we would intuitively acknowledge\nas ‘physical’ (such as spatial location). As pointed out\nin\n 2.1,\n the relevant ‘physical’ properties would more likely have\nto resemble the sorts of properties currently invoked in physics, our\nmost mature science and the one closest to issuing in strict laws.\nThis point has generated numerous objections to Davidson’s\ntoken-identity theory, but it also has been overlooked by some\nobjectors (see below). Davidson’s central claim is that what\nmakes a mental event identical to a physical event is that the mental\nevent has a physical description. In Davidson’s original\nformulation, monism entailed that every mental event can be\nuniquely singled out using only physical concepts (1970,\n215). It is this position that became the target of some\nDavidson’s critics\n (5.2).\n However, Davidson eventually came to explicitly deny that his monism\ncommits him to the possibility of providing descriptions of mental\nevents or actions in physical terms suitable for strict laws (Davidson\n1999d, 639; 1999b, 653–4). He noted that strict laws will say\nsomething to the effect that “whenever there is a certain\ndistribution of forces and matter in a field of a certain size at time\nt, it will be followed by a certain distribution of forces\nand matter in a field of a certain size at time\nt′” (Davidson 1999d, 639). And he claimed that\nboth the antecedents and consequents of such laws, when covering\nparticular mental events and actions, will cover much larger regions\nof space than merely the agent or her action. Why? Because while\nsingular causal statements are singular, and therefore select\nfrom a complete set of causal factors those that are salient or in\nline with our particular explanatory interests, strict laws\ndon’t themselves select—“that’s what makes\nthem strict” (Davidson 1999d, 640; see Yalowitz 1998a for an\nextended discussion of this issue and its bearing on the argument for\nboth mental anomalism as well as monism). Davidson soft-pedals how\nthis view bears on the uniqueness claim in the official statement of\nAnomalous Monism, parsing away that claim in favor of the blander idea\nthat “some physical description applies to each mental\nevent” (Davidson 1999b, 654). As subtle as it seems, this\nappears to be a fundamental shift in Davidson’s thinking about\nmonism, though it goes unexplored in his later work and has failed to\nattract the attention of his critics. \nIn any case, Anomalous Monism thus does not inherit the problem of how\nto justify specific identifications between mental and physical\nevents, because the claim that there is a physical description for\neach mental event is established purely a priori. And the\nphysical descriptions are not (indeed, cannot be) specifiable in\nprecise and uniquely identifying spatial and temporal terms. As we are\nabout to see\n (5.2),\n each of these points is overlooked by many of Davidson’s\ncritics. That the latter is overlooked is understandable, given its\nlate appearance. However, the former point has always been\nfundamental, and critics’ failure to appreciate it is\ncurious. \nDavidson additionally claims that the relation between the mental and\nphysical properties is not merely haphazard or coincidental. A\nrelationship of supervenience obtains between the two (Davidson 1970,\n214; 1973a, 253; 1993; 1995a, 266). (Davidson never argues for\nsupervenience. For discussion, see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical.)\n A working statement of this relationship is that if two events fail\nto share a mental property, they will fail to share at least one\nphysical property (Davidson 1995a, 266)—or, equivalently, if two\nevents share all of their physical properties, they will share all of\ntheir mental properties. It is meant to articulate a kind of\ndependency of the mental on the physical, and correlatively a kind of\nexplanatory primacy to the physical, but without claiming any kind of\nreductive relation between the mental and the physical. The working\nstatement’s truth depends, it seems, on the thought that the\ndistribution of physical properties somehow explains the\ndistribution of mental properties—failure to share a mental\nproperty depends upon/is explained by failure to share at\nleast one physical property. The supervenience relation is usually\nunderstood to issue in generalizations of the following kind:\n‘P1 → M1’,\n‘P2 → M1’,\netc. (where antecedent and consequent occur at the same time). This\nallows for the empirical possibility that a number of different\nphysical state kinds underlie the same mental state kind (for more on\nthis, see the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). However, it also\nappears to suggest the existence of lawlike relations between physical\nand mental properties, and so to be in tension with mental anomalism.\nThis issue will be explored in\n 5.3. \nThe token-identity thesis has been the subject of a number of\ninteresting criticisms. Many of them, however, are difficult to bring\nfully into contact with Davidson’s own particular version of the\nthesis, primarily because Davidson’s version is derived a\npriori from the other premises in his framework. So, for\ninstance, it has been argued that mental events do not bear the burden\nof the spatiotemporal precision of physical events that they would\nneed to if the former were genuinely identical to the latter (Hornsby\n1981; Leder 1985). For example, it would seem arbitrary to identify\nthe deduction of some conclusion from a chain of reasoning with some\nparticular neural event or set of neural events occurring at a\nspecific time and place in the brain—especially given the\nmicro-precision of the neural framework. Compare attempting to provide\nphysical description for the action of paying back a debt—how\ndoes one determine the spatial and temporal parameters with the\nprecision demanded by the language of physics? Distinguishing between\n“the” physical event, as opposed to its causes and its\neffects, can seem daunting if not outright nonsensical (Leder 1985;\nsee also di Pinedo 2006). Further, it has been argued that the only\npossible empirical evidence for specific token-identity claims could\nbe type-identities between either those or other mental and physical\nproperties, because evidence needs to be drawn from variant cases in\norder to sort out merely coincident from identical events (Leder\n1985). \nSuch criticisms become difficult to evaluate given Davidson’s\na priori procedure for establishing the token-identity\nthesis. He can respond that we already know, a priori, that\nany particular mental event must instantiate some physical property if\nit causally interacts with any mental or physical event, given the\ncause-law and anomalism principles. Questions about how this physical\nproperty, whatever it is, relates to properties currently invoked in\nneuroscience come later and are necessarily secondary to this monistic\nconclusion. And there is no guarantee (indeed, it is quite unlikely)\nthat neuroscientific properties currently in vogue are candidates for\nstrict-law properties. As we have just seen\n (5.1),\n Davidson eventually came to explicitly associate the physical\nproperties that cover mental events with broad descriptions covering\nlarge space-time regions. Further, it would confuse epistemology with\nmetaphysics to insist that, because we can only establish which\nphysical property some mental token event instantiates by leaning on\nsome type-correlations between other mental and physical properties,\ntoken-identity claims presuppose type-identity. How we discover the\nparticular physical properties is one thing; whether there can be\npsychophysical laws is quite another, and not settled by the method of\ndiscovery. \nWe also need to keep in mind that Davidson embraces the possibility of\nsubstantive mental-physical correlations (ceteris paribus\npsychophysical laws), which directly address these epistemological\nissues. More generally, Davidson’s token-identity claim is that\nthe predicates that come to form the vocabulary of the as-yet unknown\nstrict-law science will be capable of being used to describe mental\nevents. While we cannot judge this claim by appealing to features of\ncurrent neuroscience, it also seems that it should be possible to\nadjudicate conceivability concerns. And, putting aside\nDavidson’s later views, while we are not currently in the\nbusiness of assigning fine-grained spatiotemporal parameters to mental\nevents, it does not seem obvious that we couldn’t come to accept\nsuch assignments on the basis of theoretical considerations without\nthereby committing ourselves to the existence of type-identities.\nHowever, Davidson’s official position, early and late, has\nalways been that we do not need to be capable of making such\nassignments in order to assert token-identity—there must simply\nbe such true assignments, and this is something we know on the basis\nof a purely a priori argument. (Davidson 1999b; for further\ndiscussion of this issue, see the supplement on\n Related Views\n (Bare Materialism); for a different criticism of token-identity, see\nthe supplement on\n Related Views\n (Other Positions). For a criticism based upon Davidson’s own\ntreatment of causal explanation, see Horgan and Tye 1985. For\ndiscussion of the criticism that Davidson’s monism is too weak\nto warrant the label ‘materialism’, see the supplement on\n Token-Identity and Minimal Materialism). \nWe have seen that Davidson supplements his monism with a claim of\nsupervenience. There are many different conceptions of the\nsupervenience relation (see Kim 1993b), and Davidson ultimately came\nto identify his version with what is called “weak”\nsupervenience, in contrast to “strong” and\n“global” supervenience. Briefly, the basic differences\nbetween these positions are as follows. Weak supervenience links\nspecific mental and physical properties within but not across possible\nworlds, while strong supervenience links those properties across\nworlds. Global supervenience links the class of mental properties as a\nwhole with the class of physical properties as a whole within but not\nacross worlds, but does not constrain relations between specific pairs\nof mental and physical properties. Weak supervenience comes down to\nthe view that mental properties depend upon those physical properties\nthey are correlated with within a particular possible world, but those\nvery same physical properties may, in another possible world,\ncorrelate with very different (or even no) mental properties. Weak\nsupervenience is thus stronger than global supervenience, in that it\nposits correlations between particular pairs of mental and physical\nproperties, but weaker than strong supervenience in that it recognizes\nthe possibility that these correlations can fail to obtain in other\npossible worlds. (It should be noted that Davidson never brought his\nviews on supervenience into contact with his later views, noted above,\nabout the broad nature of the physical properties that mental events\nmust instantiate according to Anomalous Monism. It is not at all clear\nwhether or how these views can be combined. In the following\ndiscussion of supervenience, this complication will be ignored, and it\nwill be assumed that the physical properties in question are not of\nthis broad nature, since this is how Davidson’s own discussions\nof supervenience seem to proceed, and certainly what his critics\npresuppose.) \nThe puzzling aspect of Davidson’s doctrine of supervenience\narises independently of fine points of the disagreement between the\ncompeting conceptions of supervenience sketched above. Whether the\ndependency is between particular mental and physical properties, or\nsets of the two, and whether or not the dependency holds only within\nor also across possible worlds, it appears that it entails that there\nwill exist strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be\npredicted and explained that were supposed to be ruled out by the\nanomalism principle. Davidson sometimes claims (Davidson 1995a, 266)\nthat supervenience is actually entailed by Anomalous Monism,\nin which case it would appear to follow that Anomalous Monism itself\nis an inconsistent theory—entailing both that there cannot be\nany strict psychophysical laws (the anomalism principle) and that\nthere must be such laws (supervenience). But generally his position\nappears to be that Anomalous Monism is simply consistent with\nsupervenience (Davidson 1993, 7). If supervenience and Anomalous\nMonism are indeed inconsistent, and the former is rejected, the\nquestion of the plausibility of a materialist position with no\ndiscernible relation between mental and physical properties arises\n(see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n (The caveat about the relation between Davidson’s later views\nabout physical descriptions and supervenience noted at the end of\n 5.1.\n should be kept in mind here.) \nWhy does supervenience appear to generate strict laws? When Davidson\nfirst stated the supervenience claim, he articulated it in the\nfollowing terms: “there cannot be two events alike in all\nphysical respects but differing in some mental respects”\n(Davidson 1970, 214)). This formulation appears to entail strict\npsychophysical laws of the form\n‘P1 → \nM1’. Davidson later came to focus on the\ninversion of this formulation: “if two events fail to share a\nmental property, they will fail to share at least one physical\nproperty” (Davidson 1995a, 266). The advantage of this\nreformulation is that it brings out the fact that the requisite\nphysical differences need not be the same in each case of\nmental difference (see Davidson 1973a, 253–4). As Davidson says,\n \nalthough supervenience entails that any change in a mental property\np of a particular event e will be accompanied by a\nchange in the physical properties of e, it does not entail\nthat a change in p in other events will be accompanied by an\nidentical change in the physical properties of those other events.\nOnly the latter entailment would conflict with [Anomalous Monism].\n(Davidson 1993, 7) \nThere seem to be two problems here, however. First, the inverted\nreformulation actually entails the original thesis—that if two\nevents share all physical properties they will share all mental\nproperties—and so once again generates strict psychophysical\nlaws. Second, even if the accompanied physical changes can be\ndifferent, that simply generates more strict psychophysical\nlaws—‘\nP1 → M1’,\n‘P2 → M1’,\nand so on. So it is hard to see why Davidson thinks that the second\nformulation is consistent with the anomalism principle. \nSome defenders of Davidson (Child 1992, 224; see also Davidson 1973,\n258) have responded to the apparent tension between supervenience and\nmental anomalism by emphasizing that the degree of detail that would\nhave to go into the formulation of such laws would make them useless\nfor prediction, since it is unlikely that the relevant initial\nconditions will repeat. But as we have seen\n (4.2.3),\n this seems to be true of any candidate for a strict law—it must\ntake into account all possible interfering conditions, and doing so\nbecomes quite unwieldy for generating predictions. And in any case,\nsuch laws would still provide strict explanations of mental\nevents, contrary to Davidson’s own formulation of mental\nanomalism. So the problem that supervenience ‘laws’ seem\nto pose for the anomalism principle remains. \nOther defenders of Davidson (see Macdonalds 1986) have responded to\nthis problem by arguing that the existence of strict supervenience\nlaws is compatible with mental anomalism so long as we are not\nactually able to state any such laws and thus be in a position to use\nthem to predict and explain actual mental events—which is\ncertainly the case currently and likely for the foreseeable future.\nThis suggestion exploits a literal reading of Davidson’s\nofficial statement of the anomalism principle, which denies the\npossibility of strict laws on the basis of which mental events can\nbe explained or predicted. But in doing so, it makes Anomalous\nMonism into a much weaker position, dependent on the cognitive\nlimitations of human beings. It in effect becomes a contingent\nepistemological position rather than the necessary metaphysical\ndoctrine it purports to be. \nDavidson in one place offers a very different suggestion in response\nto the problem. He claims that the supervenient relations between\nmental and physical predicates that he envisages are of a ceteris\nparibus nature. He accepts the requirement that any satisfactory\naccount of the relation between mental and physical properties must\npermit appeal to local correlations and dependencies between specific\nmental and physical properties (Davidson 1993, 9). But he blocks any\nentailment from this requirement to strict psychophysical laws,\nsuggesting that such ‘correlations’ and\n‘dependencies’ are of a ceteris paribus form. \nSuch a ceteris paribus conception of supervenience has not\nbeen discussed in the extensive literature on the topic (its\npossibility is recognized and endorsed by Kim 1995, 136; however, see\nKim 1993, 24–25) and it is unclear whether it can deliver a\nsuitably strong notion of dependency to satisfy materialist\nintuitions. But it does seem to be an attractive way of reconciling\nsupervenience with mental anomalism so that Anomalous Monism remains a\nconsistent theory. \nIt has been widely held that Anomalous Monism cannot avoid\nepiphenomenalism—the view that mental events lack\ncausal/explanatory powers. At a first approximation, the concern\nderives from a tension between mental anomalism and the apparently\nprivileged status assigned to physical properties in Davidson’s\nframework—in particular, that all events are physical, and all\nphysical events have a strict explanation in terms of other physical\nevents. It then becomes an important question what sort of\ncausal/explanatory role mental properties can play when all events\nalready have a physical explanation. \nSome welcome this result, holding that mental events explain actions\nin a sui generis way not accountable for in the terms of\ntypical scientific explanations (see von Wright 1971; Stoutland 1976;\nWilson 1985; Ginet 1995; Campbell 1998 and 2005 and related discussion\nin the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism).\n Many, however, see this charge as devastating to the prospects of\nAnomalous Monism’s attempt to occupy a position between\nreductionist materialism and dualism. Without a distinctive causal\nrole for mental events to play in the explanation of action, many\nthink that they would lack the sort of robust reality needed to\ncompete with reductionism and dualism. On this way of thinking, only\ncausal powers can justify mental realism. So if Anomalous Monism\ncannot avoid epiphenomenalism, it appears to open the door to\neliminativist materialism, which holds that mental vocabulary and\nexplanations are vacuous and ought to be thrown out and replaced by\nneuroscience (assuming, which seems extremely doubtful, that\nneuroscience can itself supply strict laws—if not, then this\nline of thought would lead to throwing out all but\n‘physical’ strict law properties and explanations). \nAs noted, the epiphenomenalist worry arises from two points that are\nabsolutely basic to Anomalous Monism—first, that mental events\nare at the same time physical events, and, second, that while mental\npredicates cannot figure into strict causal laws, physical predicates\nmust. Early critics moved quickly from these points to the\nepiphenomenalist conclusion that mental properties are causally\nirrelevant, because there are always strict law\nproperties—physical properties—to causally explain the\noccurrence of an event. (For detailed discussion of this line of\nargument, see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance.)\n Among many other problems with this line of argument, however, there\nis the one immediately capitalized on by Davidson: that within the\nextensionalist metaphysical framework in which Anomalous Monism is\ndeveloped\n (2.1\n above), properties don’t cause anything, and so can be neither\ncausally relevant nor irrelevant. According the Davidson, only events\nare causal relata. He expresses general skepticism about\nepiphenomenalist objections to Anomalous Monism that depend on the\nidea that events cause ‘by virtue’ of the properties they\ninstantiate (Davidson 1993, 6, 13). This is closely connected to his\nsharp distinction between causation—a metaphysical relation\nbetween particular events independently of how they are\ndescribed—and explanation—which relates events only as\nthey are described in particular ways. But as we will now see, this\ndoesn’t end the concerns about epiphenomenalism. (For related\ndiscussion concerning epiphenomenalism and its bearing on the\nrelationship between Anomalous Monism and human freedom, see \n Related Issues: 3.2 Anomalous Monism and Contemporary Compatibilism.) \nCritics of this extensionalist line of defense insisted that related\nquestions remained about Anomalous Monism even taking into account the\ndistinction between causation and explanation. In particular, they\nquestioned whether mental properties could play any genuine\nexplanatory role—whether they had explanatory\nrelevance—given the priority assigned to physical\nproperties in Davidson’s framework. Why think that mental\nproperties explain anything given that the events which instantiate\nthem always also instantiate physical properties that figure in causal\nlaws? One thought here is that genuine explanations require laws, and\nmental anomalism, in ruling out psychological and psychophysical laws,\ncannot account for any explanatory role for mental properties vis a\nvis physical or mental events. \nIn response, Davidson notes that while Anomalous Monism rejects the\npossibility of strict laws in which mental predicates can figure, it\nallows for ceteris paribus psychological and psychophysical\nlaws (Davidson 1993, 9–12). His point appears to be that if\nbacking by law is sufficient for explanatory relevance, then mental\nproperties are explanatorily relevant. (Davidson and his critics often\nslide between the issues of causal and explanatory relevance, but the\nlatter issue is clearly what is at stake given Davidson’s views\nabout causal efficacy and properties.) Second, Davidson appeals to the\nsupervenience of mental properties on physical properties in order to\nground the explanatory role of mental properties. Davidson says\nthat \nproperties are causally efficacious if they make a difference to what\nindividual events cause, and supervenience ensures that\nmental properties do make a difference to what mental events cause.\n(Davidson 1993, 15) \nThe first point does not get developed by Davidson in any systematic\nway, though it has been explored by others interested in defending\nnonreductive monism from epiphenomenalist concerns. Some have focused\non exploiting ceteris paribus covering laws for\npsychophysical causal relations, claiming that this allows mental\nproperties to be sufficient for their effects, thus providing the\nneeded type of explanatory role (McLaughlin 1989; Fodor 1989, 1991).\nOthers have attempted to sidestep the issue of covering laws entirely\nby appealing directly to the truth of psychological and psychophysical\ncounterfactuals in grounding the explanatory role of mental properties\n(LePore and Loewer 1987, 1989; Horgan 1989). Davidson himself instead\nfocused on supervenience (although as we are about to see, the\npossibility of ceteris paribus laws enters into his\naccount). \nSupervenience implies that \nif two events differ in their psychological properties, they differ in\ntheir physical properties (which we assume to be causally\nefficacious). If supervenience holds, psychological properties make a\ndifference to the causal relations of an event, for they matter to the\nphysical properties, and the physical properties matter to causal\nrelations. (Davidson 1993, 14)  \nThe point here is not simply that mental properties inherit or\npiggyback on the causal powers of the physical properties on which\nthey supervene. Rather, Davidson appears to be claiming that mental\nproperties influence the causal powers of their subvenient\nphysical properties. \nOne problem with Davidson’s response here is its reversal of the\ndependency relationship between mental and physical properties\ntypically claimed in supervenience relationships. A central rationale\nfor positing supervenience is to mark a kind of explanatory primacy to\nthe subvenient properties (see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n And this is reflected in the first part of Davidson’s\nformulation above—surely a difference in psychological\nproperties entails (requires) a difference in physical properties\nbecause the difference in physical properties is needed in\norder to explain the difference in psychological properties.\nSo the sense in which psychological properties ‘matter’ to\nphysical properties is that changing the former amounts to a change in\nthe latter because a change in the latter explains a change\nin the former. This does not appear to be helpful in establishing the\nexplanatory relevance of mental properties. Another problem, discussed\nabove\n (5.3),\n is that it is difficult to see how a supervenience relation of\nsufficient power to make mental properties explanatory of an\nevent’s physical properties in the way Davidson seems to suggest\ndoes not issue in strict laws. So it is unclear how supervenience is\nconsistent with the anomalism principle, and thus how it can help\nblock epiphenomenalist concerns, although we did previously note one\npotentially worthwhile but unexplored possibility—a ceteris\nparibus supervenience relation—which Davidson endorses. \nKim has explored a related but different route from Anomalous Monism\nto mental epiphenomenalism—the problem of explanatory exclusion\n(Kim 1989, 44). A causal explanation of an event cites a sufficient\ncondition for that event’s occurrence. This seems to exclude the\npossibility of other independent causes or explanations of that event.\nSo if, as Anomalous Monism entails, physics can provide a sufficient\nexplanation of any particular event, there appears to be no room for\nan independent and irreducible mental explanation of an event\n(Davidson 1993, 15). It is because the cause instantiated some\nparticular physical property that the effect (which happens to\ninstantiate a mental property) came about. Any mental properties that\nthe cause instantiates seem superfluous in explaining why the effect\noccurred—unless those properties are identical or related in\nsome strict lawlike way to the physical properties, something ruled\nout by the anomalism principle. \nDavidson responds by arguing that citing only the physical properties\nof the cause to provide a sufficient explanation of an action does not\naddress the particular interests that psychological explanations of\nactions serve—providing the reasons of the agent in light of\nwhich she performed the action that she did. Serving these explanatory\ninterests compensates for the fact that such explanations cannot be\nsharpened into strict laws or folded neatly into physical laws\n(Davidson 1991, 163). We only understand why the agent waved her\nhand—why the effect is of the mental kind ‘waving\none’s hand’ (as opposed to merely ‘one’s hand\ngoing up and down’)—by citing mental properties\nof the causing event, such as her wanting to greet her friend. The\ncitation of physical properties of the causing event and the\nassociated mere bodily movement will not bring about such\nunderstanding, assuming mental anomalism, because of the lack of any\nreductive relationship between either the physical properties of the\ncause and the agent’s reasons or the physical properties of the\neffect and the agent’s action. \nHere we see the interest-relativity of explanation and its bearing on\nexplanatory relevance (see the supplement on\n Mental Properties and Causal Relevance)\n playing an important role for Davidson. Mental properties must be\ncited if we want a rational explanation of mental\neffects. Davidson’s response to epiphenomenalist concerns can\nthus be described as a kind of ‘dual explananda’\ntheory of the explanatory role of mental properties. According to this\ntheory, for every (causally interacting) mental event there are two\ndistinct explananda in need of explanation: an event of a\ncertain physical type and an event of a certain mental type. Mental\nproperties are accorded an ineliminable and (given Anomalous Monism)\nirreducible explanatory role by virtue of their singular capacity to\nmake intelligible the occurrence of other mental properties through\nthe sui generis relation of rationalization. This reflects\nthe point made at the end of\n 4.3\n by the causal definition interpretation of the argument for mental\nanomalism: that rationality underlies, not mental anomalism, but\nrather mental realism. (For related discussion of the dual\nexplananda approach, see Macdonalds 1995 and Gibbons\n2006.) \nIt should be noted, however, that it is not the case that\nonly mental properties can explain and be explained by the\noccurrence of mental properties. That would lead to an\n“outlet” problem, with mental properties being\nexplanatorily insulated from physical properties—something\ninconsistent with the way in which we ordinarily think of\nmental-physical interaction. A blow to the head can, for instance,\nexplain the occurrence of a thought. And a thought can explain the\nmovement of an object, as when my decision to quench my thirst leads\nto the movement of a glass of water to my lips. However, the blow\ncannot rationalize the thought, and the decision cannot rationalize\nthe movement of the glass (though it can rationalize the\naction of moving the glass). Davidson’s dual\nexplananda strategy provides no account of such phenomena\n(for discussion of the outlet problem, see Gibbons 2006). Nonetheless,\nso long as there are occurrences of mental properties in need of the\ndistinctive kind of explanation provided by rationalization, mental\nproperties occupy an ineliminable explanatory role. And given\nAnomalous Monism, that role is irreducible. It is worth noting that\nthis dual explananda strategy is consistent with\nDavidson’s commitment to the causal closure of the physical\ndomain (Crane 1995 seems to miss this point)—every physical\nevent can have a physical explanation, even if the mental component of\nsome physical events can be rationally explained only through appeal\nto mental components of the causing event. Therefore, however causal\nclosure ultimately enters into Anomalous Monism (see the supplement on\n Causal Closure of the Physical and Anomalous Monism),\n it does not appear to create any further problems for Anomalous\nMonism’s ability to account for the ineliminable, irreducible\nexplanatory role of mental properties. \nThe interest-relativity of causal explanation is thus crucial in\nDavidson’s grounding of the ineliminable explanatory role of\nmental properties within the framework of Anomalous Monism. If, as\nAnomalous Monism contends, mental event-types such as actions are not\nreducible to physical-event types, then the only way to explain\nactions (as opposed to mere bodily movements) so as to make them\nintelligible is by appeal to the mental properties of the\ncause—reasons. (For discussion of whether, in light of this,\nreason explanations can still be maintained to be causal\nexplanations within the framework of Anomalous Monism, see the\nsupplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.) \nA final point to consider in evaluating the epiphenomenalist\nobjections to Anomalous Monism is the way in which causality enters\ninto the constitution of reasons and reasons-explanations according to\nDavidson. Before we have established the anomalism principle, or go on\nto derive monism, we already know that reasons explain actions by\ncausing them (the ‘because’ problem discussed in\n 2.2).\n And, as we have seen\n (4.3),\n we know that propositional attitudes and mental contents are\nindividuated, and thus defined, partially in terms of what they are\ncaused by and cause (for attitudes, see Davidson 1987b, 41; for\ncontents, see Davidson 1987a, 444, and extended discussion in the\nsupplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism)). But if something cannot\neven be recognized as a reason unless it is a cause, then the charge\nthat mental properties are causally impotent appears to have\ndifficulty getting any traction. And since these claims are prior to\nthe argument for monism, they are neutral about whatever else reasons\nmust be in order to be causes. So reasons must be recognized as causes\nprior to any discovery that they are also physical events. This\nappears to secure the causal potency of reasons in a way entirely\nindependent of the claim of token-identity. Within Davidson’s\nframework, reasons can only play the rationalizing and explanatory\nrole that they do by virtue of their causal nature. \nMany of Anomalous Monism’s epiphenomenalist critics do not\naddress this rich causal background. As we have seen, the background\nis not sufficient by itself to silence all epiphenomenalist concerns.\nBut it does significantly affect how those concerns can be formulated\nand addressed. Anomalous Monism is clearly deeply committed, at a\nnumber of levels, to the causal explanatory relevance of the mental,\nand so charity suggests that we try to understood it in a way such\nthat these commitments are respected. The dual explananda\nstrategy discussed above\n (6.2)\n provides one promising framework for doing this, while at the same\ntime displaying sensitivity to the sorts of concerns driving the\nepiphenomenalist objections. \nDespite the initial appearance of simplicity in its assumptions,\nstructure and argumentation, we have turned up several important\nproblems and lacunae that stand in the way of any overall final\nassessment of the plausibility of Anomalous Monism. While the central\nobjections it has faced have derived from epiphenomenalist concerns,\nthe force of these objections is not clear. Arguably, the most serious\ndifficulties for Anomalous Monism are not with its adequacy but with\nits justification. We still stand in need of a clear argument for how\nrationality leads to the anomalism principle; there are the\nsubstantial problems surrounding the status of the causal closure of\nthe physical and its bearing on monism; and the cause-law\nprinciple’s strictness requirement is still in need of a\ncompelling rationale. Even with these problems, Anomalous Monism\ncontinues to provide an extremely useful framework for exploring\nfundamental issues and problems in the philosophy of mind, and has\nearned a central place on the rather short list of important positions\non the relation between mental and physical events and properties.","contact.mail":"yalowitz@umbc.edu","contact.domain":"umbc.edu"}]
