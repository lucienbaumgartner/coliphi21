Du Bois was an activist and a journalist, a historian\nand a sociologist, a novelist, a critic, and a philosopher—but it\nis the race problem that unifies his work in these many\ndomains. \n\n\n\nDu Bois contributes to our specifically philosophical understanding\nof race and the race problem, because he treats these themes as objects\nof philosophical consideration—indeed, it is largely through an\nengagement with Du Bois’s work that many contemporary\nphilosophers have come to appreciate race and race-related concerns as\nfruitful topics of philosophical reflection. Through his work in social\nphilosophy, political philosophy, and the philosophy of art, Du Bois,\nfor all intents and purposes, invented the field of philosophy and\nrace, thereby unsettling and revising our views of the proper scope and\naims of philosophical inquiry.\n\n\nOver the course of his career, Du Bois’s social philosophy\ncomprised contributions to social ontology, social theory, the\nphilosophy of the human and social sciences, and the diagnosis of\nsocial\n problems.[1]\nHis analysis\nof the nature of a social problem and, specifically, his diagnosis of\nthe Negro problem; his social constructionist accounts of race and\nracial differences; his ongoing reflection on the methods, purposes,\nand sometimes moral significance of social inquiry; and his elaboration\nof the claim that the concept of race, operating as a mechanism of\npower, structures relations of social domination, all played a critical\nrole in what he ultimately came to call his “evolving program for\nNegro freedom” (1944, 31). The present section bears on Du\nBois’s analysis of the Negro problem and his contributions to the\nphilosophy of race. Section 3, below, focuses on his\ncontributions to the philosophy of the social sciences. \n\nDu Bois considers the Negro Problem both objectively and\nsubjectively—both from the standpoint of science and from the\nstandpoint of lived experience. \n\nIn “The Study of the Negro Problems” (1898), one of his\nearliest publications, Du Bois responded to then contemporary\ndiscussions of America’s “Negro problem” by\nconceptualizing the problem as an object of social scientific\ninquiry. Sociology studies social phenomena, and the social\nphenomena that interest Du Bois are the cluster of social problems\naffecting American Negroes (the Negro is not a problem, in his view,\nalthough problems affect the Negro [see Gordon, 2000]). In the\nperspective of sociology, the Negro problem just is a cluster\nof social problems (1898,\n 77–78).[2] \nBut what is a social\n problem?[3] \n\nDu Bois answers this question by defining a social problem as\n“the failure of an organized social group to realize its group\nideals, through the inability to adapt a certain desired line of action\nto given conditions of life” (1898, 78). One example is the\nfailure to enact the ideal of a luxurious home life due to prevailing\nmarriage customs. Another is the failure to enact the ideal of\neconomic and social development due to crime and lawlessness.  \n\nThe historical evolution of the social problems that Du Bois\nidentifies as Negro problems has been a “baffling adjustment of\naction and condition which is the essence of progress”\n(1898,\n 82).[4] \nTurning to the\npresent, Du Bois characterizes the then current (circa 1898) Negro\nproblems as so many failures to enact the ideal of incorporating the\nNegro masses into the group life of the American people. Du Bois\nattributes these failures to two causes: white racial prejudice towards\nNegroes and Negro cultural backwardness. Racial prejudice is the\nconviction “that people of Negro blood should not be admitted\ninto the group life of the nation no matter what their condition may\nbe” (1898, 82). Cultural backwardness is economic\ndisadvantage, ignorance, and deficiency with regard to the art of\norganized social life. Each of these causes accounts for one of\ntwo distinct classes of Negro problems (1898,\n 82–3).[5] \n\nDu Bois’s social ontology and causal explanation of Negro\nproblems lay the basis for his research agenda. The study of the\nNegro as a social group focuses on Negro problems that have\narisen independently of racial prejudice in the Negro’s social\nenvironment. In turn, the study of the Negro’s social\nenvironment considers Negro problems that have resulted from\nracial prejudice. Du Bois’s program for studying the Negro\nas a social group includes historical study, statistical investigation,\nanthropological measurement, and sociological\n interpretation.[6] \n\nIn Du Bois’s view, the Negro Problem is a subjectively lived\nand felt social condition, not only an object of social scientific\ninquiry. In “Strivings of the Negro People” (1897b)\nand The Souls of Black Folk (1903a), Du Bois adduces the\nconcept of double-consciousness to characterize the subjectively lived\nand felt experience of the Negro problem. Ascribing double\nconsciousness specifically to the Negro, Du Bois characterizes it as a\n“sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others,\nof measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in\namused contempt and pity” (1903a, 3). In Du Bois’s\nview, double-consciousness obtains when blacks see themselves through\nthe pitying and contemptuous eyes of the racially prejudiced whites\nwhose racial prejudice is one of the causes of the Negro problem. \n\nThe concept of double-consciousness is the most extensively\ndiscussed concept in the humanities and social sciences secondary\nliterature on Du Bois, and it has received substantial attention from\nphilosophers. The present, brief discussion of the concept is\nintended simply to situate it within the larger context of Du\nBois’s social philosophy. For a more detailed account of Du\nBois’s understanding of double consciousness and a survey of\ncontemporary philosophical disputes about the content and significance\nof the concept, see the entry on\n double consciousness.\n \n\nIn “The Study of the Negro Problems,” Du Bois predicates\nhis analysis of Negro problems on his analysis of social problems\nas such; in another early essay, “The Conservation of\nRaces” (1897a), he similarly predicates his answer to the\nquestion, “What is a Negro?” on an answer to a more\nfundamental question, “What is a race?” Du Bois turns\nto the human sciences to say what a race is, but also to account for\nthe existence of spiritually distinct races. Du Bois’s\nhistorical-sociological definition of race overlaps his\nhistorical-sociological explanation of the existence of\nspiritually distinct races. To put the point more precisely, and\nin an idiom that is familiar to contemporary philosophers, Du Bois\nholds that the same sorts of historical and social factors construct\nrace both constitutively and\n causally.[7] \n\nWe begin by analyzing Du Bois’s explanation of the\ndistinctiveness of distinct races. We then turn to his definition\nof race, which he introduces to counter the objection that, because\nspiritually distinct races cannot be identified as races from\nthe perspective of the natural sciences, they cannot be identified as\nraces at all. After considering contemporary philosophers’\nongoing debates about Du Bois’s definition of race in\n“Conservation,” we turn to Du Bois’s later treatments\nof race and the notion of whiteness in Dusk of Dawn (1940),\nBlack Reconstruction (1935), and “The Souls of White\nFolk” (in Darkwater (1920)). \n\nIn explaining and defining race, Du Bois participates in a\nturn-of-the-century conversation in German philosophy about the\nsubjects and methods that distinguish the human from the natural\nsciences—that is, the Geisteswissenschaften from the\nNaturwissenschaften. Responding to Auguste Comte’s\nand J.S. Mill’s efforts to reform the human sciences on the model\nof the natural sciences, German scholars addressed a variety of\nquestions as to the human sciences’ cognitive aims, possible\nmethodological autonomy, and dependence on psychology. When Du\nBois arrived in Berlin in 1892, the conversation was well underway and\nhad already benefitted from the significant contributions of Wilhelm\nDilthey and Wilhelm Wundt several years earlier. During the 1890s there\nwere further contributions, in particular the writings of Georg Simmel,\nWilhelm Windelband, and Heinrich Rickert. Although Du Bois\ninitially presented “The Conservation of Races” as an\naddress to the American Negro Academy, the essay was a significant\naddition to the German debate, for it marks Du Bois’s turn from\nthe Naturwissenschaften to the Geisteswissenschaften\nto explain the differences between races and to conceptualize\nracial\n identities.[8] \n\nAlthough Du Bois’s essay acknowledges, as the “final\nword of science, so far,” that physical differences distinguish\n“at least two, perhaps three, great families of human\nbeings—the whites and Negroes, possibly the yellow race”\n(1897a, 52), it more importantly maintains that that there exist eight,\nspiritually distinct races. It also maintains that each\nspiritually distinct race, as such, is causally constructed by\nhistorical and social factors, for it asserts that each spiritually\ndistinct race causally owes its spiritual distinctiveness (its peculiar\nmessage, which dictates its particular historical role) to such\nfactors—specifically, to the common histories, laws, religions,\nhabits of thought, and conscious strivings that have caused it to be\nthe cohesive, spiritually distinct race it is (1897, 54–56). \n\nDu Bois also holds that the spiritual distinctiveness of a\nsocio-historical race cannot be explained in terms of physical,\nbiological facts. Like Wilhelm Dilthey, whose Introduction to\nthe Human Sciences (1883) had appeared a decade before Du Bois\nheard him lecture in Berlin, he expressly questions the possibility of\ncausal explanations that reduce spiritual facts and differences to\nbiological facts and\n differences.[9] \nThus, Du Bois rejects\nthe physio-biological reductionism characteristic of nineteenth century\nracial science: the thesis that physical racial differences causally\nexplain the spiritual and cultural differences between racial\ngroups. Spiritual differences have historical and social causes\n(law, religion, and so on), which Du Bois takes to be causally\nindependent of biological racial facts (1897a,\n 54–55).[10] \n\nHaving sketched a preliminary account of the “subtle\nforces” that have causally divided human beings into spiritually\ndistinct races, Du Bois writes that, while these races “perhaps\ntranscend scientific definition, nevertheless, [they] are clearly\ndefined to the eye of the Historian and Sociologist” (1897a,\n53).  \n\nThat spiritually distinct groups may not be readily identified as\nraces if one adopts the perspective of the natural sciences does not\nentail that they cannot be identified as races at all. Reminiscent of\nDilthey, again, Du Bois holds that the natural sciences and the human\nsciences have distinct subject matters (physical facts, on the one\nhand, spiritual facts on the other), and suggests that the former,\nbecause they conceptualize human beings exclusively in physical terms,\ncannot conceptualize them in terms of social and historical facts, and\nthus cannot conceptualize them in terms of the social and historical\nfacts that define spiritually distinct groups as races (Du Bois’s\nreason for claiming that social and historical facts “transcend\nscientific definition”). If, however, one adopts the\nperspective of the human sciences; if, in other words, one adopts the\nconceptual “eyes” of the historian and the sociologist,\nthen one sees these social and historical facts standing “clearly\ndefined” to one’s point of view. From this point of\nview, Du Bois proposes, it is possible to identify spiritually distinct\n races as races,[11]\nand\nthus to state a definition of race—or, in other words, to specify\nthe historical and social factors that constitute a group of human\nbeings as a race. \n\nHere, Du Bois’s distinguishes between the factors that\ngenerally (usually) characterize a race and the factors that must\nalways characterize a race; that is, the factors that\nconstitute a group of people as a race. Du Bois’s\ndefinition proposes that a group of human beings counts as a\nspiritually distinct race if, and only if, the members of the group\nhave a common history, common traditions and impulses, and common\n(voluntary and involuntary) strivings; counting as members of a\nspiritually distinct race does not require a common blood or a common\nlanguage, however, although the members of a spiritually distinct race\nmay indeed speak the same language or have the same blood coursing\nthrough their veins (see Lott, 1992–93; Gooding-Williams, 1996 and 2009;\nand Sundstrom, 2003). Du Bois’s definition asserts that\neach spiritually distinct race is, as such, constitutively\nconstructed by the historical and social factors the definition\nspecifies as making a race a race. \n\nIt has not escaped notice that the list of historical and social\nfactors that Du Bois identifies as causally constructing (as\nexplaining) the existence and cohesiveness of spiritually distinct\nraces—common histories, laws, religions, habits of thought, and\nconscious strivings—echoes the list of factors he identifies as\nconstitutively constructing (as defining) a group of human beings as a\nspiritually distinct race—common history, traditions, impulses,\nand strivings (see Gooding-Williams, 2009, 51). To be sure, the\nlists are not identical. Still, we can reasonably assume that Du\nBois means them to capture the same content, supposing that the\ntraditions and impulses indicated in the second list include legal and\nreligious traditions as well as persistent habits of thought. Du\nBois holds not only that historical and social factors constitutively\nand causally construct spiritually distinct races, but, likewise, that\nthe same kinds of historical and social factors constitutively\nand causally construct spiritually distinct races. \n\nWhat, then, is a Negro? To be a Negro, Du Bois replies, is 1)\nto be a member of one of three biologically distinct races, and 2) to\nbe a member of one of eight constitutively and causally constructed\nspiritually distinct races. The Negro is spiritually\ndistinguished from other spiritually distinct races by its distinctive\nmessage, the content of which, Du Bois argues, is not yet fully\narticulated (1897, 55–56). \n\nContemporary philosophers have devoted considerable attention to Du\nBois’s explanation and definition of race in “The\nConservation of Races;” indeed, they have given more attention to\nDu Bois’s definition than to his treatment of any other\nphilosophical issue. Nearly all that attention can be traced to\nKwame Anthony Appiah’s engagement with Du Bois in “The\nUncompleted Argument: Du Bois and the Illusion of Race” (Appiah,\n1985), an expanded version of which Appiah published as the second\nchapter (“Illusions of Race”) of In My Father’s\nHouse (Appiah, 1992). \n\nAppiah’s critique of Du Bois (see Appiah, 1985 and\nAppiah,\n 1992[12])\nargues for three, key\nclaims: 1) that Du Bois’s definition of race fails to state\ncriteria that serve to individuate his eight, spiritually distinct\nraces; 2) that, notwithstanding Du Bois’s intention to\nconceptualize race in socio-historical terms, the criteria he in fact\nuses to individuate spiritually distinct races comprise a physical,\nbiological component—specifically, the idea of a common ancestry;\nand 3) that, notwithstanding his ongoing,\npost-“Conservation” efforts to substitute “a\nsociohistorical conception of race for the biological one,” the\nlogic of his argument “leads naturally to the final repudiation\nof race as a term of difference” (Appiah, 1985, 34–35). \nAppiah endorses this conclusion, stating that “[t]he truth is\nthat there are no races,” and that “the notion [of race]\nthat Du Bois required, and that underlies the most hateful racisms of\nthe modern era, refers to nothing in the world at all” (Appiah,\n1992, 45). \n\nFor the most part, philosophical criticism of Appiah’s reading\nof Du Bois has targeted his analysis of Du Bois’s definition and\nhis antirealism about race. In an early response to Appiah,\nLucius Outlaw (1996, 28) argues that Du Bois’s definition of race\nis the articulation of a cluster concept, and not, as Appiah presumes,\nthe statement of a set of conditions individually necessary and jointly\nsufficient to constitute a group of people as a\n race.[13] \nIn addition, Outlaw (1996, 21–22, 28)\ndefends, and attributes to Du Bois, a version of racial realism,\naccording to which biological ancestry and physical characteristics\nplay a role in defining race. \n\nOther critics of Appiah’s reading of Du Bois have been less\ninclined than Outlaw to defend or to attribute to Du Bois a definition\nof race involving biological characteristics; rather they have tended\nto argue that, Appiah’s arguments to the contrary, Du Bois\nsucceeded in advancing a plausible, non-biological, socio-historical\ndefinition of race. Paul Taylor (2000), for example, takes issue\nwith Appiah’s claim that Du Bois’s appeal to “common\nhistory” as a criterion of individuation is circular, arguing\nthat Appiah misconstrues Du Bois’s understanding of what it means\nfor two individuals to have a history in\n common.[14] \nRonald Sundstrom (2003) also defends Du\nBois’s socio-historical definition, arguing that, on a\nmetaphysical pluralist reading, it can do the work of individuation\nthat Appiah says it cannot do. For Taylor and Sundstrom, Du Bois\nwas a racial realist who cogently defended the thesis that race is a\nsocial kind. \n\nMore recently, Chike Jeffers and Robert Bernasconi have productively\nre-oriented the philosophical discussion of “Conservation”\naway from debates stemming from Appiah’s interpretation of\nthe\n essay.[15] \nOn\nBernasconi’s account, these debates have tended to anachronism,\nand so tended to overlook the context-specific intentions animating Du\nBois’s essay. In Jeffers’s view, the Appiah-inspired\ndebates have missed a key distinction shaping Du Bois’s social\nconstructionism.  \n\nAccording to Bernasconi, recent philosophical discussions of Du\nBois’s explanation and definition of race “have tended to\ndistort its meaning by imposing an alien question on it” (2009,\n519). Rather than read “The Conservation of Races” in\nlight of contemporary arguments about racial eliminativism (about\nwhether, in Appiah’s words, race should be repudiated as a term\nof difference) and the proper referent of the concept of race,\nBernasconi places Du Bois’s essay in its immediate political and\nhistorical setting. Specifically, he emphasizes Du Bois’s\nengagements with the thought of Edward Wilmot Blyden, Alexander\nCrummell and Frederick Douglass and argues that the intended point of\nthe essay was “to give hope to blacks at a time when scientists\nwere questioning their future on the basis of suspicions about the\nimpact of race mixing on their capacity to survive the struggle for\nexistence” (2009,\n 536).[16] \nWith Bernasconi’s intervention, debate\nabout Du Bois’s 1897 essay has turned to the metaphilosophical\nquestion of the relative value of anachronistic (presentist) and\nantiquarian (historicist) approaches to the study of the history of\nAfrican American philosophy (see, e.g., Taylor, 2013 and\nGooding-Williams, 2017). \n\nAccording to Jeffers (2013), the Appiah-inspired discussion of Du\nBois has ignored the distinction Du Bois draws between political and\ncultural versions of the thesis that race is\nconstitutively\n constructed.[17]\nThe political\nversion of the thesis, which Du Bois rejects, Jeffers argues, holds\nthat “‘racialized subordination’…constitutes\nits [race’s] very existence” (2013,\n 413).[18] \nThe cultural version, which Du Bois\nendorses, Jeffers argues, holds that the cultural factors mentioned in\nDu Bois’s definition (traditions, ideals of life, and so on)\nconstitutively construct races as “distinct\ncultures” (2013, 411). Jeffers describes the cultural\nversion of socio-historical constructionism that he attributes to Du\nBois as Du Bois’s “cultural theory of\n race.”[19] \n\nJeffers advances criticisms of Du Bois’s definition of race\nand, unlike most other philosopher commentators, of his causal\nexplanation of the existence of spiritually and culturally distinct\nraces. Regarding the latter, he questions the reliability of Du\nBois’s general, historical account of the genesis of the social\nfactors to which Du Bois attributes the existence of these races\n(Jeffers, 2013, 417). Regarding the former, he adduces an\nimportant conceptual point: namely, that Du Bois neglects to justify\nthe assumption that the historical and social facts that define and\ndistinguish the spiritually distinct groups that the historian and the\nsociologist identify as races should be thought to constitute\n(constitutively to construct) those groups as races.\n Perhaps they serve simply to constitute them as cultural\nentities, or, as Du Bois himself sometimes writes, as nations (Jeffers,\n2013, 416). Absent that assumption, neither the historian nor the\nsociologist is entitled to identify the clearly defined, spiritually\ndistinct groups he or she observes as races. And, absent\nthat assumption, Du Bois is hardly entitled to present the definition\nthat he bases on what the historian and the sociologist observe as\nanswering the question, “What, then, is a\n race?”[20] \n\nNotwithstanding his criticisms of Du Bois, Jeffers, following Outlaw\n(1996), endorses and defends Du Bois’s “strong commitment\nto the preservation and cultivation of black cultural difference”\n(Jeffers, 2013,\n 419).[21] \nJeffers has also shown that Du Bois maintains that commitment\nthroughout his intellectual career (Jeffers, 2017). \n\nPhilosophers interested in Du Bois’s thinking about race in\nwritings he essayed after the publication of “The Conservation of\nRaces” have tended to focus on Dusk of Dawn\n(1940). In this connection, both Paul Taylor (2000, 2004a, 2004b,\nand 2014) and Robert Gooding-Williams (2014) have elaborated detailed\naccounts of the notion of race that Du Bois sketches in the book he\nsubtitled “An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race\nConcept.” In a related vein, Joel Olson (2004), Shannon\nSullivan (2006), and Terrance Macmullen (2009) have examined Du\nBois’s conceptualization of whiteness, giving particular\nattention to Dusk of Dawn but also to Du Bois’s earlier\nworks. Olson reads Dusk of Dawn as advancing an argument\nDu Bois initiates in Black Reconstruction (1935). \nSullivan and Macmullen read it as advancing an argument Du Bois\ninitiates in “The Souls of White Folk” (see\nDarkwater (1920)). \n\nIn chapter 6 of Dusk of Dawn, entitled “The White\nWorld,” Du Bois imagines a dialogue between himself and a\nfictional interlocutor, Roger Van Dieman. Near the conclusion of\nthe exchange, Du Bois says that “[r]ace is a cultural, sometimes\nan historical fact,” to which Van Dieman responds “But what\nis this group [the black race] and how do you differentiate it”\n(1940, 77). Du Bois rejoins his interlocutor, remarking that he\nrecognizes “it [the black race] quite easily and with full legal\nsanction; the black man is a person who must ride Jim Crow in\nGeorgia” (1940, 77). \n\nHere, Du Bois seems to reject biological concepts of race, and while\nhe asserts that race is a cultural and sometimes an historical fact,\nhis reference to the Jim Crow car suggests that he is no longer\nconceptualizing the Negro or any race as a group united by a distinct\nspiritual message. But if the cultural and sometimes historical\nfact of race is neither a biological nor a spiritual fact, what sort of\nfact is it? \n\nOn Taylor’s account, Du Bois means to answer this question by\nproposing that race is an institutional fact. Following\nJohn Searle (1995), Taylor understands institutional facts, like\nmarriage and money, to be ontologically subjective and\nepistemologically objective (2000, 110; 2004a, 109; 2004b, 91). \nRealizing that “collective intentionality can bring certain facts\ninto being” (2000, 110), Taylor’s Du Bois, like Searle,\nunderstood race to be constitutively constituted by human mental\nstates\n (2004, 109).[22] \n\nGooding-Williams interprets Dusk of Dawn as defending a\ngenealogical concept of race. Taking Du Bois’s subtitle as\nindicative of his larger philosophical aims, he argues that Du\nBois’s essay toward the autobiography of a race concept is a mode\nof conceptual analysis that historicizes the concept of race. Due\nto the affinity of Du Bois’s philosophical strategy to Friedrich\nNietzsche’s approach to the analysis of concepts,\nGooding-Williams describes that strategy as\n“genealogical.” \n\nNietzsche thought that making sense of the concept of punishment\nmust be a matter of unpacking the dense, synthesis of meanings\n(purposes, functions) that, over time, have been willfully interpreted\ninto and forcibly imposed on specific procedures for inflicting harm\n(Nietzsche, 1998, 50–54). More generally, he understood that conceptual\nanalysis can take the form of genealogy—that is, of historical\ninquiry that separates the distinct meanings that have been joined\ntogether and even conflated through episode after episode of\nreinterpreting one and the same, more or less stable set of phenomena\n(procedures, complexes of habits, feeling, ways of perceiving, and\nso\n forth).[23] \nIn sum,\nNietzsche held that historically formed concepts, like our notion of\npunishment, “are like ropes held together by the intertwining of\nstrands, rather than by a single strand running through the whole\nthing” (Clark, 1994, 22). To analyze such concepts, he argued,\n“is not to find necessary and sufficient conditions for their use\nbut to disentangle the various strands that have become so tightly\nwoven together by the process of historical development that they seem\ninseparable” (Clark, 1994, 22) \n\nOn Gooding-Williams’s account, Du Bois 1) treats differences\nin the color of men as the more or less stable set of phenomena\nundergirding the concept of race, and 2) characterizes the concept of\nrace as an intricate web of manifold and often conflicting\ninterpretations of those differences formed over the course of his\nlifetime. Autobiography, a narrative form of historical inquiry, is the\nvehicle through which Du Bois genealogically analyzes that web of\ninterpretations, for to reconstruct the story of his life is, in his\nview, to disentangle these interpretations, one from the other, in\norder to show that and how they have been exemplified in his life\n(Gooding-Williams, 2014,\n 166–167).[24] \n\nThus, Du Bois worries that what he has called a “race\nconcept” is not, strictly speaking, a concept, for he sees that\nit is not the sort of concept that can be defined by specifying a set\nof non-contradictory and hence logically coherent conditions for its\nproper application. Contradiction can inhabit the race concept,\nbecause Du Bois, like Nietzsche, allows that historically formed\nconcepts may comprise discordant interpretations of the meaning of one\nand the same set of phenomena. The race concept is\n“illogical,” but is not for that reason without the\nefficacy characteristic of “forces,” “facts,”\nand “tendencies” (Du Bois, 1940, 67). Indeed, the\nefficacy of the concept is such that, internal inconsistencies\nnotwithstanding, it has dominated Du Bois’s life. Du\nBois’s exemplification of the race concept is his subjection to\nit. Reminiscent, again, of Nietzsche, he holds that historically\nformed concepts can function as mechanisms of power and control\n(Gooding-Williams, 2014,\n 167).[25] \n\nAccording to Joel Olson (2004), Du Bois’s understanding of\nwhiteness belongs to the political theory of race he begins to sketch\nin Black Reconstruction. Specifically, Du Bois\nconceptualizes whiteness as a privileged position of social standing\nthat has 1) afforded white workers a public and psychological wage\ncompensating them for their low economic wages; and 2) formed the basis\nof a cross-class, political alliance uniting white workers and\ncapitalists against black workers (black slaves included). More\ngenerally, he maintains that whiteness has historically functioned as a\nmechanism of power for recruiting white workers to police and reinforce\nthe economic exploitation of black workers. On Olson’s\naccount, Du Bois explains the “splendid failure” of\nReconstruction and the genesis of the American racial order through his\nanalysis of the cross-class political alliance of white workers and\ncapitalists (Olson, 16, 30). \n\nIn Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois further develops his understanding\nof whiteness by interpreting racial oppression as, in Olson’s\nwords, “a political problem of dark and white worlds arrayed\nagainst each other, with the white world determined to subordinate the\ndark one” (Olson, 22). Placing the conceptual opposition\nbetween white and dark (or non-white) worlds at the center of his\nanalysis, Du Bois especially emphasizes the role whiteness plays in\nlegitimizing the “domination of white Europe over black Africa\nand yellow Asia” (Du Bois, 1940, 48; see, also, Du Bois, 1940,\n85–87; and Olson 26, 155, fn.60). \n\n“The Souls of White Folk” can be read as Du Bois’s\ncentral contribution to the moral psychology of white supremacy; that\nis, as his account of the affective, motivational, and cognitive\ndispositions that constitute white supremacism as a morally vicious\ncharacter trait—including, e.g., the dispositions passionately to\nhate black folk; to slander and murder black folk; and to believe that\nwhite folk are inherently better than black\n folk.[26] \nIn “The White World”\nchapter of Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois complicates this earlier\npsychological portrait of the white supremacist, stressing the deeply\ningrained persistence of her or his racist behavior. Du Bois\nargues, for example, that “the present attitude and action of the\nwhite world…is a matter of conditioned reflexes; of long\nfollowed habits, customs and folkways; of subconscious trains of\nreasoning and unconscious nervous reflexes” (Du Bois, 1940,\n87). Productively building on Du Bois’s moral psychology,\nShannon Sullivan (2006) and Terrance Macmullen (2009) have recently\nbrought Du Bois into conversation with John Dewey to develop\npragmatist, habit-centered accounts of the workings of white\nprivilege. \n\nIn “A Program for a Sociological Society” (ca. 1897), an\nearly essay belonging to the same period as “The Study of the\nNegro Problems” and “The Conservation of Races,” Du\nBois places the emergence of the science of sociology in historical\nperspective. Prior to the industrial revolution, he argues, there\nwas but one science that studied the phenomenon of human action:\nnamely, political economy. Political economy focused on the\nproduction, distribution, and exchange of goods under stable social\nconditions, but gave no attention to the intensification of problems of\ncrime, disease, poverty, prostitution, and ignorance that came with\n“the new concentration of industrys [sic], crowded into centers\nof population.” Sociology addresses these problems,\ndemanding a “wider inquiry into the causes and scope of human\naction.” More generally, “[s]ociology is…the name\ngiven to that vast field of inquiry into human action as manifested in\nmodern organized life.” \n\nBut what is the point of sociological inquiry—that is, of a\nsociological science of human action? Du Bois distinguishes\nbetween the immediate and the mediate aims of scientific inquiry; that\nis, between the aims of science itself and the uses of scientific\nresults by “merchants, physicians, men of letters, and\nphilanthropists”—indeed, by “all men” (Du Bois\n1897, 89; see also Du Bois, ca.1897, 1–10). For Du Bois, the\nimmediate aim of science is knowledge; the mediate aims may vary, but\nsocial reform is the mediate aim upon which Du Bois focuses throughout\nhis career (see Green and Driver, 312–313; Lewis, 1993, 225–26; Reed,\n47; and, especially, Bright, 5–7). But how can scientific\nknowledge advance social reform? Du Bois sketches at least three\ndistinct answers to this question, each of which corresponds to a\ndifferent conception of the object of social\nscientific\n knowledge.[27] \nKnowledge\nof social laws and regularities can help the reformer to settle on\neffective plans of action; knowledge of the scope and limits of chance\ncan help her to hedge her bets—that is, to guard against the\npossibility that her plans of action will fail; finally, knowledge of\nmoral facts can help the reformer to caution her fellow citizens\nagainst the disaster and sorrow that await them should they persist in\nan immoral course of action. \n\nIn an early statement (Du Bois, ca. 1897), Du Bois maintains that the\norganization of modern society is a function of social laws and\nregularities that sociology identifies through detailed, statistical\nresearch that “generalizes[s]” a “mass of\nfacts,” showing how various social phenomena, including, e.g.,\nthe “degree of poverty, the prevalence of suicide, [and] the\nextent and kinds of crime,” tend “to a certain rhythm and\nregularity which we call the social group” (ca. 1897,\n4). Knowledge of these social rhythms, regularities and, sometimes,\nlaws (sociology studies “human action which by its regularity\ngives evidence of the presence of laws”) is the “first\nstep” in modern social reform (ca. 1897, 3, 8). Such knowledge\ncan contribute to social reform, Du Bois’s examples suggest, for\nit enables the reformer to explain causally the conditions she wishes\nto transform and rationally to chart plans to alter those conditions:\ne.g., the death rate of children in the slums, the treatment of\nprisoners, and pauperism (ca. 1897,\n9–11).[28] Such knowledge, presumably, empowers Du Bois\nin his capacity as a social reformer to explain the existence of the\nNegro problem and rationally to identify means to eradicate the Negro\nproblem (see 2.1 above and 4.1.1 below). \n\nIn “Sociology Hesitant” (ca. 1905), perhaps his most\ntheoretically rich contribution to the philosophy of the human\nsciences, Du Bois takes issue with Comte’s and Spencer’s\ncollectivist\n holism[29]—the\nthesis that society is a concrete whole\n(for Du Bois, a “mystical whole”) formed of discrete\nunits—and he again defends the view that society comprises the\n“deeds of men,” as well as the “law, rule, and\nrythm” [sic] governing those deeds (ca. 1905, 274). For Du\nBois, sociology is the science of human action, not the science of\nsociety as such, or the science of society as a whole. \n\nWhy, Du Bois asks, did Comte “hesitate so strangely”\nbefore the prospect of treating human action as the proper object of\nsociological inquiry? The answer, Du Bois claims, is the\n“Great Assumption…that in the deeds of men there lies\nalong with rhythm and rule…something\nincalculable”—an assumption in light of which the prospect\nof launching a science that “would discover and formulate the\nexact laws of human action…seemed to be and was preposterous”\n(ca. 1905, 274). Comte wavered before what Du Bois calls\n“Paradox:” on one hand, “The evident rhythm of human\naction;” on the other, “The evident incalculability of\nhuman action” (ca. 1905, 275). Where Comte wavers, however,\nDu Bois sallies forth, writing “[w]hy not…flatly face the\nParadox? frankly state the Hypothesis of Law and the Assumption of\nChance and seek to determine by study and measurement the limits of\neach” (ca. 1905, 276). \n\nHuman conduct is subject to the “primary” rhythms of\nphysical law, as well as to the “secondary” rhythms of\nsocial regularities; social regularities exhibit “nearly”\nthe same uniformity as physical law, and they are also “liable to\nstoppage and change” (ca. 1905, 278). Aspiring to unite the\nGeisteswissenschaften and the\nNaturwissenschaften—“the science of man and\nphysical science”—Du Bois characterizes sociology as\n“assuming the data of physics and studying within these that\nrealm where determinate force is acted on by human wills, by\nindeterminate force” (ca. 1905, 277–278). \n\nPhysical laws and social regularities alike limit the scope of\nchance, which is to say that they limit the scope of\n“indeterminate” force, or “undetermined”\nchoice, or, as Du Bois likewise puts the point, of “free”\nand “inexplicable” will (ca. 1905, 276–278). In\npresupposing chance, sociology presupposes free will. \nSociology’s attempt to measure chance and free will is its\nattempt to measure the degree to which physical and social regularities\nlimit and constrain the range of choice and action that is\n“undetermined by and independent of actions gone\nbefore”(ca. 1905, 278). \n\nSome forty years after Du Bois wrote “Sociology\nHesitant,” he appears to allude to the earlier, then unpublished\nessay; indeed, he reflects at length on the argument of the essay,\nsuggesting that it marked the beginning of a shift in his “whole\nattitude towards the social sciences” (1944, 56): \nThen, too, for what Law was I searching? In accord with what\nunchangeable scientific law was the world of interracial discord around\nme working? I fell back upon my Royce and James and deserted\nSchmoller and Weber. I saw the action of physical law in the\nactions of men; but I saw more than that: I saw rhythms and tendencies;\ncoincidence and probabilities; and I saw that, which for want of\nanother word, I must in accord with strict tenets of Science, call\nChance. I went forward to build a sociology, which I conceived as\nthe attempt to measure the element of Chance in human conduct. \nThis was the Jamesian pragmatism, applied not simply to ethics, but to\nall human action, beyond what seemed to me, increasingly, the distinct\nlimits of physical law. \n\nMy work assumed from now on a certain tingling challenge of risk; what\nthe “Captain of Industry” of that day was experiencing in\n“kick,” from money changing, railway consolidation and\ncorporation floating, I was, in what appeared to me on a large scale,\nessaying in the relations of men of daily life (1944,\n 57–58).[30] \n\nDu Bois’s references to Weber, Schmoller, Royce, James, and\nJamesian pragmatism tie his earlier critique of Comte to an engagement\nwith what James dubbed “the dilemma of determinism” (James,\n1884). Weber was methodologically agnostic with regard to\nthe dispute between metaphysical determinists and indeterminists,\narguing that neither position entailed consequences bearing on the\nresearch practices of the historical and cultural sciences, and taking\nSchmoller to task for his profession of faith in metaphysical\ndeterminism (see Weber, 1905a, 197–196, 278; Ringer, 1997, 57–58,\n91). Thus, Du Bois breaks with both his German teachers in\ninsisting that chance—again, incalculable actions (and choices)\nundetermined by and independent of actions gone before—exists in\nthe world and in explicitly endorsing “the assumption of\nchance” as a principle of sociological\n method.[31] \nDu Bois’s contention that the\nindividual is free to the extent that her choices escape explanation in\nterms of physical and social laws and regularities echoes Royce’s\nargument that, because “the individual as such is never the mere\nresult of law,” no causal explanation can\n“predetermine” what she “uniquely wills”\n(Royce, 1899, 467–468). Du Bois misleads, however, when he\nretrospectively suggests that the argument of “Sociology\nHesitant” aligned him with James.  \n\nTo be sure, Du Bois’s language and analysis owe a\ndebt to James’s “The Dilemma of Determinism”\n(1884) and, in particular, to James’s conceptualization of the\nwill’s independence (its ability to choose courses of action not\nfixed “by parts of the universe already laid down” (1884,\n150)) in terms of the concept of chance—a debt Du Bois\nacknowledges when he describes his view as “Jamesian\npragmatism.” James explains the ethical implications of his\nindeterminism when he takes issue with Schopenhauer, “who\nenforces his determinism by the argument that with a given fixed\ncharacter only one reaction is possible under given\ncircumstances” (1879, 13). Schopenhauer forgets, James\nargues, that “in these critical ethical moments, what\nconsciously seems to be in question is the very\ncomplexion of the character” (1879, 13). As a sociologist,\nDu Bois’s purports to have applied Jamesian pragmatism beyond the\nsphere of ethics, to “all human action,” but it is\nprecisely here that he breaks with James; for notwithstanding his\ndefense of indeterminism, James is skeptical of the possibility of\nmeasuring the degree to which the will is free (James, 1890,\n572). In addition, James insists that the science of psychology\nmust methodologically reject the assumption of chance. Psychology\n“abstracts from free-will without necessarily denying its\nexistence” (James, 1892,\n 457).[32] \n\nDu Bois was no less interested in determining (again, “by\nstudy and measurement”) the limits of law than he was in\ndetermining the limits of chance. Law, he believed, marked the\nlimit of chance, and chance, he believed, marked the limit of law.\nKnowledge of social laws and regularities can contribute to social\nreform by enabling the social reformer causally to explain social\nproblems and rationally to chart plans to solve those problems. \nKnowledge of the element of chance—or, more exactly, of the scope\nand limits of chance in organized, modern social life—can\ncontribute to social reform by enabling the reformer to gauge the\nextent to which implementing his ideas would entail experimenting\nwith (“essaying”) plans of action that, due to the\nplay of chance, carry a significant risk of failure—plans that he\ncould not confidently endorse, despite his knowledge of the social laws\nand regularities shaping modern social life. Just as knowledge of\nthe scope and limits of chance could provide the “Captain of\nIndustry” who speculates in currency and trades in floated,\ncorporate stock a reason to modify his investment decisions, so too\ncould it provide the reformer a reason to modify his plans of action\nand similarly to meet the “tingling challenge\nof\n risk.”[33] \n\nIn “The Propaganda of History,” the final chapter of\nBlack Reconstruction (1935), Du Bois maintains that\n“scientific” historiography—that is, historiography\nthat “set[s] down” the record of “human\naction” with “accuracy and faithfulness of\ndetail”—can serve the ends of social reform; it can be\nused, he writes, “as a measuring rod and guidepost for the\nfuture of nations” (Du Bois, 1935, 584). Du Bois’s\nargument for this claim proceeds through a defense of four theses: 1)\nthat the study of history, so far as it belongs to the science of\nhuman action, cannot model itself exclusively on the natural sciences;\n2) that accuracy in chronicling and explaining human action requires\nthat the historian rely on the method of interpretive\nunderstanding—what Max Weber called\nVerstehen; 3) that, contra Weber, accurate, empirically sound\nhistoriography reports moral knowledge; and 4) that the knowledge of\nmorality and moral responsibility yielded by the scientific study of\nhuman history (by accurate historiography) can contribute to social\nreform, for the philosopher and the prophet can use that knowledge to\nguide mankind in the solution of social problems (1935, 591). \n\nDu Bois criticizes histories that discuss slavery with moral\n“impartially,” depicting America as helpless and the south\nas blameless, while explaining the difference in development, North and\nSouth, as “a sort of working out of cosmic social and economic\nlaw” (1935, 585). An example of this sort of history is Charles\nand Mary Beard’s The Rise of American Civilization,\nwhich treats the clash between north and south as if it were a clash\nbetween winds and waters. In the Beard’s “sweeping\nmechanistic interpretation” of history, Du Bois writes,\n“there is no room for the real plot of the story, for the clear\nmistake and guilt of rebuilding a new slavery of the working class in\nthe midst of a fateful experiment in democracy; for the triumph of\nsheer moral courage and sacrifice in the abolition crusade; and for the\nhurt and struggle of degraded black millions in their fight for freedom\nand their attempt to enter democracy. Can all this be omitted and\nhalf suppressed in a treatise that calls itself scientific?”\n(1935, 585). \n\nAt issue here, again, as in “The Conservation of Races”\nand “Sociology Hesitant,” is the relation between the human\nsciences and the natural sciences.  For the Du Bois of\nBlack Reconstruction, historians who model their inquiry\nexclusively on the natural sciences (historians like the Beards) seek\nto identify the causal uniformities (“cosmic” laws)\ngoverning human events, which events they conceptualize by analogy to\nthe behavior of the winds, waters and other forces of nature. The\nproblem here, Du Bois believes, is not with the effort to identify the\ncausal uniformities governing human events. Rather it is with the\ntendency in that effort to neglect the human meaning of human events,\nand thus to treat those events as inhuman, natural forces that lend\nthemselves to a purely “mechanistic” explanation—by\nwhich Du Bois means explanation in terms that make no reference to the\nmeanings that the human subjects who participate in those events\nattach to them. \n\nIf history is to be a science of human action and not to pretend to\nbe a science of nature, then, Du Bois believes, it must take account of\nthe subjective meanings of actions and events. Du Bois implies\nthat the historian cannot truly tell the story of “the mightiest\neffort of the mightiest century” (the struggle of enslaved blacks\nto achieve democracy) without taking account of the\n“psychology” of the agents whose actions sustained that\neffort—for to take psychology into account is to take subjective\nmeaning into account (1935, 586). More generally, Du Bois insists\nthat the historian of slavery ask: “Just what did [slavery] mean\nto the owner and the owned”(1935, 585).  \n\nTo understand slavery, knowing what it meant to the owned is no less\nimportant than knowing what it meant to the owners. In demanding that\nthe historian of slavery attend to the slaves’ stories about\nslavery in order to know what slavery meant to the slaves, Du Bois\npresupposes the fundamental, methodological tenet that the\nhistorian’s primary charge is what Max Weber called\nVerstehen, or “interpretive understanding,”\nnot mechanical explanation. According to Weber, the\nsciences of human action, including history and sociology, “speak\nof ‘action’ insofar as the acting individual attaches\nsubjective meaning to his behavior—be it overt or covert”\n(1922, 38, 41). One of the aims of Verstehen, he argues,\nis rationally to make sense of the motivation prompting an action by\nplacing that action “in an intelligible and more inclusive\ncontext of meaning”—as when, for example, we interpret a\nwoodchopper’s chopping of wood as an act undertaken to secure a\nwage; or, alternatively, to provide a supply of firewood for the\nwoodchopper’s use (1922, 42). \n\nDu Bois stresses the importance of interpretive understanding\nbecause he is committed to the view that moral judgment is a critical\ncomponent of historiography. Thus, while Du Bois methodologically\naligns himself with Weber in stressing the importance of interpretive\nunderstanding to the scientific study of history, he methodologically\nrejects Weber’s claim that “concern on the part of history\nto judge of historical actions as responsible before the conscience of\nhistory…would suspend its character as empirical science”\n(Weber, 1905b,\n 123).[34] \n\nUnlike Weber, Du Bois is a moral realist who believes that\nhistorical inquiry can afford us knowledge of moral\nfacts—knowledge, that is, of the proper distribution of moral\nresponsibility and of the extent to which actions are right or\nwrong. But to obtain that knowledge, historians must understand\nhuman action in terms of subjective meanings, for they require some\nsuch understanding of human action to render intelligible their\napplication of the vocabulary of moral evaluation—for Du Bois, a\nvocabulary that includes the language of “guilt,” of\n“moral courage and sacrifice,” and of “the degraded\nblack millions.” Du Bois argues that a necessary condition\nof the possibility of acquiring knowledge of moral facts through the\nhistorian’s practice of the science of human action is a\nVerstehen-centered approach to that practice—or, more\nexactly, an approach that explains human actions in terms of\nsubjects’ motives. Du Bois sketches a similar line of\nargument, five years later, in Dusk of Dawn (1940, 70). \n\nFor Du Bois, the function of the historian, “posing” as\na scientist of human action, is “to make clear the\nfacts…to know, as far as possible…the things that\nactually happened in the world” without regard to her personal\ndesires and wishes (1935, 591). But the function of the\nphilosopher and the prophet, he argues, is “to interpret these\nfacts” —that is, to consider them in the perspective of our\ndesire to guide mankind to undertake the social reforms needed to\naddress social problems (1935, 591).  \n\nA prophet, a Jeremiah, for example, might well adduce facts of moral\nwrongdoing and guilt to alert his fellow citizens that their actions\nrisk God’s wrath. And a philosopher, a philosopher of\nhistory, for example, might adduce those facts in order to instruct\nthem as to the meaning, writ large, of the plot that the historian has\nchronicled—precisely as Du Bois instructs his fellow citizens\nthat the story of slavery and reconstruction he has chronicled (in his\ncapacity as an historian) exhibits “the clear mistake and\nguilt” that characterizes the “plot” of Aristotelian\ntragedy (1935, 585, 595). In both cases, the point would be the\nsame: namely, to use moral knowledge to warn one’s fellow\ncitizens of the fateful consequences (God’s wrath, tragedy) that\nawait them lest they refuse to heed the lessons of the past and\nchange—reform—their ways. \n\nDu Bois’s political philosophy belongs to the Afro-modern\ntradition of political thought, an impressively rich body of non-ideal\npolitical theory that is bound together by certain thematic\npreoccupations—e.g., the political and social organization of\nwhite supremacy, the nature and effects of racial ideology, and the\npossibilities of black emancipation— and that includes the\nwritings of Ottabah Cugoano, David Walker, Edward Blyden, Martin\nDelany, Frederick Douglass, and Alexander Crummell (Gooding-Williams,\n2009). Du Bois’s most famous book, The Souls of Black\nFolk (1903a), is his earliest contribution to that\ntradition. Du Bois’s subsequent contributions to political\nphilosophy and political theory appear in several different places and\nhave been variously taken up by contemporary scholars. \n\nSouls is Du Bois’s still influential answer to the\nquestion, “What kind of politics should African Americans conduct\nto counter white supremacy?” Historically rooted in the\nsegregationist era of Jim Crow, Souls authority has reached\nwell beyond its origins, so much so that its compelling ideas and\narguments continue to be taken up by contemporary theorists of black\npolitics. \n\nIn Souls, Du Bois contends that a politics fit to respond\nto the American, Jim Crow version of racial apartheid must satisfy two\nconditions. The first relates to Du Bois’s description of\nAfrican Americans as “masses:” to wit, to his\ncharacterization of African Americans as an aggregate of uncultured,\npre-modern slaves or former slaves. The second relates to his\ndescription of African Americans as a “folk:” that is, to\nhis characterization of African Americans as a group united by a\ncollectively shared ethos, or spirit.  \n\nFor Du Bois, a politics suitable to counter Jim Crow had to uplift\nthe black masses—to assimilate them to the constitutive norms of\nmodernity—and to heed the ethos of the black folk. In\nshort, it had to be a politics that embraced and promoted the core\nvalues of modern life while expressing the spiritual identity of the\nfolk. Du Bois envisions black elites—the so-called\n“talented tenth” (1903b)—as deploying a politics of\nexpressive modernization to uplift the black masses. Elite\ncontrol of black politics can be authoritative and effective, he\nargues, only if it expresses a collective spirit that unites black\npeople.  \n\nThe young Du Bois’s political philosophy rests on the social\nphilosophy he outlines in “The Conservation of Races” and\n“The Study of Negro Problems.” In arguing that talented\ntenth elites could enjoy political legitimacy and efficacy only if\ntheir actions expressed a distinctive message that spiritually\ndistinguished the Negro from other spiritually distinct races and that\nunited all African Americans, he presupposes his earlier answer to the\nquestion, “What is a Negro?” In arguing that talented\ntenth elites needed to attack racial prejudice and cultural\nbackwardness alike in order to uplift and modernize the black masses,\nhe presupposes his earlier, causal analysis of Negro problems\n(Gooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 1). \n\nDu Bois’s extended critique of Booker T. Washington’s\npolitical thought (see Souls, chapter 3) likewise presupposes\nhis earlier, causal analysis of Negro problems. Du Bois’s\nargument immediately drew attention, for when Du Bois published\nSouls Washington had securely established himself “as an\neducational statesman, the primary spokesman of black America, and the\nleader of a large network of disciples—the ‘Tuskegee\nMachine’—who edited newspapers, owned businesses, and\ndirected schools modeled on Tuskegee”(Blight and\nGooding-Williams, 1997, 16). \n\nWashington held that if blacks endeavored to help\nthemselves—to discipline their bodies, to cultivate\nentrepreneurial virtues (e.g. thrift, spirit of industry, and economy),\nand to acquire the knowledge of a trade—they would thrive in the\ncapitalist market and, due to their business success, bring an end to\nJim Crow and win the franchise. In short, he believed that black\nself-help efforts were sufficient to engender business success, and\nthat business success was sufficient to persuade whites to extend to\nblacks the civil and political rights they required for incorporation\ninto the mainstream of American society (Washington,\n 1901).[35] \n\nContra Washington, Du Bois argued that self-help efforts, while\nnecessary for black social progress, were not sufficient. Assuming that\nboth racial prejudice and cultural backwardness cause Negro problems,\nDu Bois claims that a self-help politics that attends to the\nbackwardness of the Negro group itself without attacking racial\nprejudice is doomed to fail. Washington had argued that there was\nno need to attack prejudice for the present, because self-help efforts\nthat contended with entrepreneurial-economic backwardness (for Du Bois,\na form of cultural backwardness) would suffice to defeat it. Du\nBois rejects this argument on the grounds that the persistent,\nprejudice-sustained denial of rights to blacks undermines their\nself-help efforts and prospects for business success. \nWashington’s program amounts to a partial, one-sided attack on\nthe Negro problems. In Du Bois’s view, black uplift and\nsocial progress required that black political elites attack both prongs\nof the Negro problem—racial prejudice no less than\nbackwardness. It also required institutions of higher learning to\ntrain these elites. Thus, Du Bois takes Washington to task for\npromoting an educational philosophy that emphasized vocational\neducation at the expense of higher, liberal arts education (Du Bois,\n1903a, chapter 3). \n\nIn Souls, Du Bois sketches a biographical portrait of his\nmentor, Alexander Crummell, and a fictional portrait of a tragic hero,\nJohn Jones, to show how double-consciousness can compromise black elite\npolitical\n leadership.[36]\nSpecifically, Du Bois represents double-consciousness as a form of\nalienation that estranges black elites from their followers, thereby\neroding their ability to promote ends expressing the collectively\nshared spirit of the black folk and undermining their legitimacy and\nefficacy as leaders (Du Bois, 1903a, chapters 1, 12–13;\nGooding-Williams, 2009, chapter 3). \n\nThe early Du Bois’s defense of a black elite-led politics of\nexpressive modernization has exerted considerable influence on post-Jim\nCrow political philosophical appraisals of black American\npolitics. Indeed, it is all but impossible to grasp the point of\nthose appraisals without taking account of their engagements, both\nexplicit and implicit, with key elements of Du Bois’s early\npolitical thought. For extended discussion of the issues central\nto the post-Jim Crow inheritance of Du Bois’s early political\nthought, see, especially, Reed, 1999 and Gooding-Williams, 2009,\nchapter 6. \n\nAs Lawrie Balfour has argued, Du Bois wrote\n“prolifically” on a broad array of topics, so that his\nwritings can usefully be read as an extended series of essayistic,\nexperimental efforts to address the various issues that engaged him\n(2011, 17–18). The reception of Du Bois by contemporary political\ntheorists attests to the extraordinary, topical scope of his political\nthought, especially as it evolved after the publication of\nSouls. \n\nIn several post-Souls writings, Du Bois returns to the\ntheme of black political leadership. In Dusk of Dawn,\nfor example, he reaffirms his belief that “the Talented\nTenth” should determine “the present field and demand for\nracial action and the method by which the masses may be guided along\nthis line” (1940, 159). And several years later, after\ncritically reflecting on his earlier thinking about group leadership,\nhe proposes a “new idea for a Talented Tenth” (1948,\n168). Whether or not Du Bois ultimately rejected his earlier\nconception of elite black leadership (Du Bois, 1903b) is an issue of\nscholarly dispute. Joy James holds that Du Bois eventually\nrepudiates the idea of a black intelligentsia vanguard (James,\n1997). Cornel West contends that Du Bois’s later revisions\nof his concept of the talented tenth were “piecemeal”\n(West, 1996, 71). Adolph Reed, by way of a meticulous reading of\nDu Bois’s later writings and speeches, argues that Du Bois\nadvanced an elite-centered notion of black politics throughout his\nintellectual and activist career (Reed, 1997). Tommie Shelby and\nPaul Taylor provide especially nuanced reconstructions of Du\nBois’s evolving understanding of black political leadership\n(Shelby, 2007, chapter 2; Taylor, 2010, 907–910.). \n\nAn important and still underappreciated strand of Du Bois’s\npost-Souls political thought is his engagement with Marxist\nsocial and political theory. A key text, here, is Black\nReconstruction (1935), Du Bois’s monumental critique of the\nDunning School’s interpretation of\n Reconstruction.[37] \nLike Joel Olson (2004; see\n2.2.4.3 above), Cedric Robinson (1983) and Anthony Bogues (2003) have\nargued that Black Reconstruction should be read as historical\nand political theory, not simply as revisionist historiography. \nOn Robinson’s reading, Du Bois developed “a theory of\nhistory, which by its emphasis on mass action was both a critique of\nthe ideologies of American socialist movements and a revision of\nMarx’s theory of revolution and class struggle” (Robinson,\n277). Bogues agrees that Du Bois breaks with Marx and Marxist\northodoxy, and adds that, like other black radical theorists, Du Bois\nreorients the radical critique of modernity away from “issues of\npolitical obligation, sovereign self and citizenship…to\nquestions of domination, oppression, and politics as a practice of\nfreedom” (Bogues, 93). Building on Du Bois and on Robinson’s\nengagement with Du Bois, the historian, Walter Johnson (2016) has more\nrecently argued that the history of slavery and racial capitalism\nprovides a standpoint from which “to rethink our idea of\njustice” (Johnson, 29). \n\nFeminist theorists’ appraisals of Du Bois’s political\nthought have been mixed, ranging from criticisms of his masculinist\nfailure to regard black women as intellectuals and race leaders (e.g.\nCarby, 1998 and James, 1997) to praise for his advocacy of\nwomen’s equality and his contributions to our understanding of\nthe oppression of black women (e.g., James, 1997 and Griffin,\n2000).  \n\nFeminist theorists’ commentary on Du Bois’s political\nthought has tended to concentrate on chapter 7 of Darkwater\n(1920),  “The Damnation of Women.” \nWomen are damned, Du Bois proposes, for “only at the sacrifice of\nintelligence and the chance to do their best work can the majority of\nwomen bear children” (1920, 78–79). While Farah Griffin\ninterprets “Damnation” in the perspective of a still\npersistent “politics of protection” that threatens the\nautonomy of black women, arguing that Du Bois recognized the limits of\nthat politics (2000, 34–36), Lawrie Balfour reads the essay as\ncontributing to a “feminist theory of citizenship” (2011,\n99–100). Taking issue with Balfour, Shatema Threadcraft argues\nthat “Damnation” reprises and elaborates\nSouls’ masculinist treatment of manliness as an\nappropriate norm of citizenship (2017, 92–94). \n\nConsidering Du Bois in light of black feminist and more general\nforms of contemporary intersectionality theory (which considers\nintersections between race, gender and class), Ange-Marie\nHancock examines Souls, Darkwater, and Dusk of\nDawn to identify insights in Du Bois’s thinking that link\n“his political theory with that of today’s\nintersectionality theorists” (2005, 82). It would be\nanachronistic to describe Du Bois as an intersectionality theorist,\nHancock admits, but she still claims that Du Bois anticipates recent\nintersectionality theory in arguing “that more than one category\nof difference should be attacked simultaneously, and, more importantly,\nthat the structures of society operate such that these categories\nmutually reinforce social stratification for its least empowered\ninhabitants” (2005, 79). \n\nHow did Du Bois conceptualize democracy?  \n\nDu Bois mentions democracy just once in Souls, where he\nstates that the “soul of democracy and the safeguard of modern\nsociety” is “[h]onest and earnest criticism from those\nwhose interests are most nearly touched,—criticism of writers by\nreaders, of government by those governed, of leaders by those\nled” (1903a, 23). Du Bois defines democracy in terms of\ncriticism when he attacks Booker T. Washington for “hushing\ncriticism” (1903a, 23). In exploring the implications of Du\nBois’s statement for the picture of black politics he defends in\nSouls, Gooding-Williams raises a question as to whether elite\nleadership of backwards, black masses not competent to criticize their\nleaders could both satisfy Du Bois’s definition of democracy and\nsuccessfully promote an uplift agenda (Gooding-Williams, 2009, chapters\n1 and 4.) \n\nDu Bois’s most thoroughgoing contribution to democratic theory\nis chapter 6 of Darkwater, “Of The Ruling of\nMen.”  In that essay, Du Bois engages familiar,\nTocquevillian worries about the tyranny of the majority; envisions\ndemocratic decision making in deliberative democratic terms; and\ndefends not only a broadly inclusive form of political democracy, but\nthe idea that modern industry should be subject to democratic decision\nmaking—in essence, the idea of democratic socialism. His\nargument for inclusiveness, for extending the right of democratic\nparticipation to women and blacks, for example, is essentially\nepistemic: “only the sufferer knows his suffering\nand…no state can be strong which excludes from its expressed\nwisdom the knowledge possessed by mothers, wives, and\ndaughters…The same arguments apply to other excluded\ngroups” (1920, 69; see, also, Bright, 2017, 14–15).  \n\nIn Black Reconstruction, no less than in “Of the\nRuling of Men,” Du Bois characterizes democracy in economic as\nwell as political terms; that is, as the legitimate transfer of\npolitical and economic power from the ruling classes to the working\nmasses. Cornel West interprets Black Reconstruction as\npromoting a Deweyan notion of creative democracy (West, 1988). \nGooding-Williams (1991) disputes that interpretation, arguing that it\nobscures the connotations of class struggle that attach to Du\nBois’s account of black workers’ efforts to reconstruct\ndemocracy. In Color and Democracy, which Du Bois\npublished just more than a decade after Black Reconstruction,\nhe writes that “[m]ore important than political democracy is\nindustrial democracy; that is, the voice which the actual worker,\nwhether his work be manual or mental, has in the organization and\nconduct of industry” (1946,\n 300).[38] \n\nThe ongoing importance of Du Bois’s contributions to\ndemocratic theory has been well established by the recent work of\nLawrie Balfour and Tommie Shelby.  \n\nIn her essays on Darkwater, Dusk of Dawn, and other\nwritings, for example, Balfour subtly brings Du Bois’s political\nthought into conversation with the work of contemporary political\ntheorists. To reorient democratic theory in dark times, Balfour argues,\nwe would do well to think politically with Du Bois. To that end,\nshe examines the political-theoretical ramifications of Du Bois’s\nliterary choices; his use of history to highlight the implication of\nAmerica’s slave past in its post-Civil Rights present; his\ndepiction of African American lives as exemplary representatives of\ndemocratic possibility; and his globally expansive political\nimagination, which, Balfour argues, reveals the racial politics of\nrecent defenses of cosmopolitanism and civic nationalism (Balfour,\n2010,\n 2011).[39] \n\nIn Shelby’s view, Du Bois took African-Americans to be the\nbearers of a world-historical mission to perfect the ideals of American\ndemocracy. Du Bois endorsed black political solidarity, Shelby\nargues, as a temporary and, possibly, long-term strategy for\nestablishing a multiracial, culturally pluralist American polity that\nembodied those ideals. Shelby follows Du Bois in maintaining that\nblack political solidarity in the pursuit of a racial justice that is\nconsonant with American democratic and liberal ideals requires a\nmotivational foundation that unites self-interest, moral principle, and\nracial identification (Shelby, 2007, 6–7, 67, 87).  \n\nIn chapter 1 of Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois describes his thought\nregarding the causes of the oppression of the darker races as evolving\nthrough three stages—roughly, from thinking that racial\noppression was caused by ignorance; to thinking that it was caused by\nignorance and ill-will; to thinking that it was caused by\nignorance and ill-will and a conjunction of economic\nmotives and unconscious, irrational acts and reactions. \nCorresponding to each stage, Du Bois tells us, was an increasingly\ncomplex account of the political strategies the darker races require to\nupend racial oppression. Where ignorance is the problem, science\nand education is needed to fight racial injustice; where ill-will is\nthe issue, the black world must fight for its freedom, relying on\ntruth, boycott, propaganda and mob frenzy as instruments of sudden and\nimmediate assault. Where, finally, economic interest and/or\nunconscious, irrational motive sustain racial oppression, “not\nsudden assault but long siege was indicated; careful planning and\nsubtle campaign with the education of growing generations and\npropaganda” (1940, 2–3). \n\nPrior to 1940, some consideration of each of these causes of\noppression and related strategies of resistance is evident in Du\nBois’s writings. Still, Dusk of Dawn is remarkable\nfor the prominence it gives to the role of unconscious and irrational\npsychological forces in accounting for the existence and perpetuation\nof racial oppression. Du Bois attributes this new emphasis to the\n“new psychology” of the “Freudian era.” \nHis “study of psychology under William James” had prepared\nhim for the Freudian turn, he remarks, and its “meaning and\nimplications…had begun slowly to penetrate his thought”\n(1940, 148).  \n\nContemporary political theorists have, for the most part, tended to\nignore Du Bois’s Freud-inspired account of racial\noppression. An exception is Shannon Sullivan, for whom Du Bois\nsuggests “a powerful psychoanalytic-pragmatist model for\nsurveying the unconscious operations of white domination”\n(Sullivan, 2006, 23). A second exception is Ella Myers, who has\nbegun to build on Du Bois’s arguments to reflect on the visceral\nand affective registers of antiblack racism (Myers,\n 2017).[40] \nRobert Gooding-Williams\n(2011) has adapted Du Bois’s idea of a “long siege”\nagainst racial oppression—against what Du Bois also calls\n“the strongholds of color caste”—to a critical\nanalysis of some recent discussions of racial politics (1940, 148). \n\nPaul Taylor has persuasively sketched a general framework for\nunderstanding Du Bois’s philosophy of art. According to\nTaylor, Du Bois endorses an expressivist picture of the world, the key\nto which “is a determination to think of things as determinate\nbut provisional expressions of an evolving world.” On this\nview, “the world unfolds into new forms the way a seed unfolds\ninto a tree…by clarifying, over time, what was inchoate and\nimplicit: by actualizing in history what formerly existed only in\npotentia.” Considered in the perspective of\nMarx’s and Dewey’s revisions of Hegel’s expressivism,\nTaylor’s Du Bois envisions ethical life as a\nwork-in-progress—that is, as an ongoing project of holistic\nself-cultivation, of individuals artistically forming themselves by\ncreatively responding to the histories, languages, and economic\nstructures that constrain them (Taylor, 2016, 91–93). \n\nDu Bois’s articulation of his commitment to the ideal of\nholistic self-cultivation is perhaps most explicit when, in amplifying\nhis criticism of Booker T. Washington, he defends the importance of\nliberal arts education (Gooding-Williams, 2009, 133–139). \nExplicitly echoing Matthew Arnold, Du Bois advocated liberal arts\neducation as a means to self-cultivation or, as he sometimes writes,\nself-development, through “getting to know…the best that\nhas been said and thought in the world” (Arnold, 1869,\n5). Self-development through the acquisition of culture is\nthe purpose of the education elites require to uplift the masses. \nThe Negro college, Du Bois writes, “must develop men…Above\nour modern socialism, and out of the worship of the mass, must persist\nthat higher individualism which centres of culture protect; there must\ncome a loftier respect for the sovereign human souls that seeks to know\nitself and the world about it; that seeks a freedom for expansion and\nself-development” (1903a, 52). \n\nFor the Du Bois of Souls, the art that sovereign souls\nappreciate is high art—or, in other words, art that shares with\nthe sovereign souls that appreciate it the property of holistic\nself-development. In “The Sorrow Songs,” the final\nchapter of Souls, Du Bois represents the group spirit that\nunites black Americans as clarifying its distinctive message through\nthe medium of the folk song. Considered in historical\nperspective, the musically embodied spirit of the black folk, as it\nactualizes itself through time, in folk song after folk song, acquires\na spiritually comprehensive breadth that overcomes racial prejudice and\nprovincialism. To these songs, which manifest a developing folk\nspirit and that constitute an evolving tradition of black musical art,\nDu Bois contrasts a “mass” of spiritually inert minstrel\nsongs, gospel hymns and coon songs (1903a, 124). In essence, he\nargues that, no less than Wagner’s operas, which he admired, the\nspiritually-inspired black folk song belongs to the canon of high art\nfrom which the low arts of the minstrel song and the like are\nexcluded. \n\nOn this view, Du Bois’s early political expressivism is of a\npiece with his broadly expressivist philosophy of art, for it asserts\nthat, to be legitimate and effective, black political leaders must take\ntheir bearing not from the uninspired mass of popular song that the\nmasses might enjoy, but from the spirit and spiritual message embodied\nin the black folk song (Gooding-Williams, 2009, 139–147). \n\nDu Bois’s essay, “Criteria of Negro Art” (1925),\nis his most important contribution to the philosophy of art. The\nessay is Du Bois’s clearest statement of his disagreement with\nthe philosopher and Dean of the Harlem Renaissance, Alain Locke, about\nthe relation between art and propaganda. Against Locke’s\nview that genius and talent “must choose art and put aside\npropaganda,” Du Bois held “that all art is propaganda and\never must be” (Locke, 1928, par. 1; Du Bois, 1926, par.\n29). At issue in Du Bois’s “great debate” with\nLocke is the role of the arts “in creating respect for a people\nsuffering from humiliation and self-loathing” (Harris, 15). \n\nDu Bois claims that artists rely on beauty to communicate truth and\ngoodness (in all its aspects of justice, honor, and right)—in the\nfirst case to promote universal understanding, and in the second to\ngain sympathy and human interest. The “apostle of\nBeauty,” he writes, “thus becomes the apostle of truth and\nright not by choice but by inner and outer compulsion. Free he\nis, but his freedom is ever bounded by Truth and Justice” (par.\n28). \n\nConsidering these claims in the perspective of Du Bois’s\nexpressivism, Taylor plausibly interprets Du Bois as arguing that,\nbecause artists “are dialectically enmeshed in wider webs of\nmeaning concerning the true and the just, and must create themselves as\nindividuals by working out their orientation to these networks,”\nall art is propaganda. On this account, no work of art can\nreasonably claim to derive its content from “a distinct and\ninviolate domain of aesthetic value,” for all art derives its\ncontent from a public domain of ethico-political value to which the\nartist must creatively respond. The artist is at once\noutwardly and inwardly compelled by the webs of meaning that encumber\nher, for while these webs of meaning impose themselves from\n“without,” the artist suffers them as parameters\nconstituting her “within” as a subject. The freedom\nthat the apostle of truth and right can claim in relation to these\nparameters is akin to self-legislation—it is the freedom she\nenjoys in creatively responding to them, in working out her\nrelationship to them and, in effect, making them her own (Taylor, 2016,\n96–99).  \n\nBy exercising her freedom, finally, by creating beautiful works of\nart that promote the ends of sympathy and universal understanding, the\nartist may undertake to widen the ethical and cognitive horizons of her\nintended addressees, and thus to expand their capacity for judgment.\n In writing a book like Souls, for example, Du Bois\nundertook to widen his white counterparts’ capacities to\nsympathize with and evaluate the suffering in the souls of black\nAmericans (Rogers, 2012, 193–198). \n\nWhat is the nature of beauty such that it can achieve these ends\nthrough the communication of truth and goodness? Du Bois never\nstates a clear answer to this\n question.[41] \nBut he offers clues to an answer in\n“Of Beauty and Death,” chapter 9 of\nDarkwater.  In that essay, his most sustained reflection\non the nature of beauty, Du Bois contrasts beauty to “ugliness\nand hate and ill…with all their contradiction and\nillogic;” beauty, he writes, “is fulfillment. It\nsatisfies. It is always new and strange. It is the\nreasonable thing” (1920, 120). Perhaps Du Bois’s\npoint is an expressivist one: that beauty satisfies by clarifying our\nideas of truth (at once consistent and reasonable) and goodness (the\nopposite of hate and ill); that is, by embodying those ideas in novel\nand unsettling works of art. \n\nWe conclude this entry by noting that an ongoing feature of scholarly\ndebate about Du Bois is sometimes contentious disagreement as to his\nproper place in intellectual history and/or the history of\nphilosophy. A brief survey of the variety of interpretive\norientations that usefully have been brought to bear in appraising Du\nBois as a philosopher, or as a thinker, suggests that, in studying his\nwritings, we might do well to heed Nietzsche’s suggestion that\nthe multiplication of perspectives can often enhance our knowledge of\nthe subject matter under consideration (Nietzsche, 1887, 85). \n\nThe relevant categories tend to be geographic, racial, thematic, or\nsome combination of the three. Du Bois’s philosophical books and\nessays have been read as contributions to American thought (Zamir,\n1995) and to American political thought (Reed, 1997). More\nnarrowly and more broadly, they have been read as statements\nof Afro-American exceptionalist thought (West, 1982); as key\nconstituents of the black nationalist tradition (Moses, 1978); as\nimportant additions to the black natural law tradition (Lloyd, 2016);\nas a part of the history of African American prophetic political\ncritique (Marshall, 2011); and as critical contributions to Africana\nand Afro-Modern thought (Gordon, 2008; Gooding-Williams, 2009).\n Intending to correct the tendency evident in these works to\nposition Du Bois as an American, black American, Africana, and/or\nAfro-modern thinker, Appiah (2014) has highlighted the late\n19th century, German intellectual milieu that shaped Du\nBois’s thinking. Contra Appiah, Tommy Curry (2014) has\nargued that we lose sight of the philosophical substance of Du\nBois’s thought if, like Appiah, we scant the influence of other\nAfrican American writers on his thinking. \n\nAmong critics wishing to situate Du Bois within a well-defined,\nwestern philosophical tradition, the main tendencies have been to\ncharacterize Du Bois either as a pragmatist (see West, 1989, Taylor,\n2004b, and Kahn, 2009) or as an Hegelian of sorts. Much of the\nliterature following this second line of interpretation has considered\nDu Bois’s writings, and especially Souls, in the\nperspective of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit (see,\ne.g., Gooding-Williams, 1987 and 1991; Zamir, 1995; and, most\nrecently, Shaw, 2013). In this connection, Paul Taylor (2004b)\nhas persuasively argued that we need not choose between an Hegelian Du\nBois and a pragmatist Du Bois. More recently, Nahum\nChandler has proposed to read Du Bois neither as an Hegelian, nor as a\npragmatist, but in parallel to several of his European contemporaries,\nincluding Husserl, Weber, Durkheim, Boas and Freud (Chandler,\n2014). \n\nTo be sure, it would be false to claim that all of the\nabove-mentioned interpretive perspectives have yielded genuine insight\nand illumination. But more have than have not, a fact that\nprimarily attests to the range, depth, and fecundity of Du Bois’s\nphilosophical thought.","contact.mail":"rg2944@columbia.edu","contact.domain":"columbia.edu"}]
