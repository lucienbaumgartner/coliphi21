Davis","entry":"kyoto-school","body.text":"\n\n\nThe Kyoto School (Kyōto-gakuha) is a group of\n20th century Japanese thinkers who developed original\nphilosophies by creatively drawing on the intellectual and spiritual\ntraditions of East Asia, those of Mahāyāna Buddhism in\nparticular, as well as on the methods and content of Western\nphilosophy.\n\n\nAfter an introductory section, this article will focus on four\nquestions: How should the Kyoto School be defined? What is meant by\nits central philosophical concept of “absolute\nnothingness,” and how did the Kyoto School philosophers\nvariously develop this Eastern inspired idea in dialogue and debate\nwith Western thought and with one another? What are the basics of\ntheir political writings, and the basis of the controversy surrounding\nthem? What is the legacy of the Kyoto School for cross-cultural\nthinking?\n\nThe unintentional founder of the Kyoto School is\n Nishida Kitarō[1]\n (1870–1945). In the Meiji period (1868–1912), when Japan\nreopened itself to the world after more than two centuries of national\nisolation, a generation of scholars devoted themselves to importing\nWestern academic fields of inquiry, including\n“philosophy.” After many years of studying Western\nphilosophy and Eastern classics, alongside a dedicated practice of Zen\nBuddhism, Nishida was the first major modern Japanese thinker to\nsuccessfully go beyond learning from the West to construct his own\noriginal system of thought. This he began to do in his maiden work,\nAn Inquiry into the Good, published in 1911 (Nishida 1990).\nOn the basis of this work he obtained a position in the Philosophy\nDepartment of Kyoto University, where he went on to ceaselessly\ndevelop his thought and to decisively influence subsequent generations\nof original philosophers, including the two other most prominent\nmembers of the Kyoto School, Tanabe Hajime (1885–1962)\nand Nishitani Keiji (1900–1990). \nAs is reflected in the name of the School, its founding members were\nassociated with Kyoto University, the most prestigious university in\nJapan next to Tokyo University. It is perhaps no coincidence that the\nSchool formed in Kyoto, the ancient capital and center of traditional\nJapanese culture, rather than Tokyo, the new capital and center of\nmodernization, which also meant, Westernization. While the Kyoto\nSchool philosophers all devoted themselves to the study of Western\nphilosophy (indeed they made lasting contributions to the introduction\nof Western philosophy into Japan), they also kept one foot firmly\nplanted in their native traditions of thought. One scholar of the\nKyoto School writes in this regard: “The keynote of the Kyoto\nschool, as persons educated in the traditions of the East despite all\nthey have learned from the West, has been the attempt to bring the\npossibilities latent in traditional culture into encounter with\nWestern culture” (Minamoto 1994, 217). \nIt would be misleading, however, if we were to think of the Kyoto\nSchool as merely putting a Western rational mask over Eastern\nintuitive wisdom. Nor would it be entirely accurate to think of them\nas simply using Western philosophical idioms and modes of thought to\ngive modern expression to East Asian Buddhist thought. For not only is\nthe Western influence on their thought more than skin deep, their\nphilosophies are far too original to be straightforwardly equated with\npreexisting Eastern thought. Insofar as they can be identified as East\nAsian or Mahāyāna Buddhist thinkers, this must be understood\nin the sense of having critically and creatively developed\nthese traditions in philosophical dialogue with Western thought. It\nshould be kept in mind that their primary commitment is not to a\ncultural self-expression, or even to a dialogue between world\nreligions, but rather to a genuinely philosophical search for\ntruth. \nThe Kyoto School has become most well known, especially in the West,\nfor its philosophies of religion. Indeed the initial reception of the\nKyoto School in North America in particular took place in university\ndepartments of Religious Studies, where their philosophies of religion\nhave frequently been viewed as representative of Mahāyāna\nBuddhism, specifically of the latter’s Zen and Shin (True Pure Land)\n schools.[2]\n While the exchange on these terms has been fruitful, this view can be\nmisleading in two respects. First of all, even if, for most of the\nKyoto School thinkers, a philosophy of religion is the ultimate\narche and telos of their thought, it is hardly their\nsole concern. They address a full array of philosophical issues:\nmetaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, philosophical\nanthropology, philosophy of history, philosophy of culture, philosophy\nof language, ethics, political theory, philosophy of art, etc. \nSecondly, even when their focus is on the philosophy of religion, they\napproach this topic in a non-dogmatic and often surprisingly\nnon-sectarian manner, drawing on and reinterpreting, for example,\nChristian sources along with Buddhist ones. Even Nishitani, who did in\nfact come to identify his thought with “the standpoint of\nZen,” adamantly refused the label of a “natural theologian\nof Zen.” He claimed that: “If I have frequently had\noccasion to deal with the standpoints of Buddhism, and particularly\nZen Buddhism, the fundamental reason is that [the original form of\nreality and the original countenance of human being] seem to me to\nappear there most plainly and unmistakably” (NKC X, 288;\nNishitani 1982, 261). \nKyoto School philosophy, therefore, should be understood neither as\nBuddhist thought forced into Western garb, nor as universal discourse\n(which the West happened to have invented or discovered) dressed up in\nJapanese garb. Rather, it is best understood as a set of unique\ncontributions from the perspective of modern Japan—that is, from\na Japan that remains substantially determined by its historical layers\nof traditional culture at the same time as being decisively\nconditioned by its most recent layer of contact with the West—to\na nascent worldwide dialogue of cross-cultural philosophy. \nThis article will proceed as follows. In the following section, I will\nconsider the preliminary issues of how to define the Kyoto School and\nwho to include as its members. The name “Kyoto School” has\nbeen used in the past, in some cases rather loosely, to refer to a\nvariety of sets of thinkers. It is therefore necessary to begin by\ndiscussing the question: Just who belongs to exactly what? The third\nand central section of this article will treat what is generally\nconsidered to be the central philosophical concept and contribution of\nthe Kyoto School, namely, its ideas of “absolute\nnothingness.” After discussing the ostensible contrast between\n“Western being” and “Eastern nothingness,” and\nafter looking at some of the Eastern sources of the idea of absolute\nnothingness, I will discuss the topological, dialectical,\nphenomenological, and existential philosophies of absolute nothingness\ndeveloped by Nishida Kitarō, Tanabe Hajime, Nishitani Keiji, and\nthe central figure of the third generation of the Kyoto School, Ueda\nShizuteru (b. 1926). The fourth section will address the political\ncontroversy surrounding the wartime writings and activities of the\nKyoto School. The first wave of attention paid to the Kyoto School in\nthe West in the 1980s largely ignored the political debate that had\nlong surrounded the School in Japan. While this lacuna in Western\nscholarship was amended in the 1990s, notably with the publication of\nRude Awakenings: Zen, the Kyoto School and the Question of\nNationalism (Heisig & Maraldo 1994), the political ventures and\nmisadventures of the Kyoto School remain a highly contentious subject\n(see Maraldo 2006 and Goto-Jones 2008). In the final section of this\narticle I will return to the question of the cross-cultural legacy of\nthe Kyoto School as a group of thinkers that stood between—or\nperhaps moved beyond—East and West. \nThere has been considerable discussion surrounding the question of how\nto define the Kyoto School, and who to include as its members. By all\naccounts Nishida Kitarō is the School’s originator. (See\nthe entry on\n Nishida Kitarō.) \n Yet it was \nnever his intention to institute a “school” based on his\nown thought; in fact he is reported to have always encouraged\nindependent thinking in his students. Moreover, unlike Plato’s Academy\nor the Frankfurt School’s Institute for Social Research, the Kyoto\nSchool thinkers never founded an academic institution or formed an\nofficial organization (at least until The Nishida Philosophy\nAssociation was founded in 2003; see the website listed below). Their\nassociation was initially based merely on the fact that they studied\nand taught at Kyoto University and developed their thinking under the\ninfluence of Nishida as well as in dialogue and debate with him and\nwith one another. Indeed the name “Kyoto School” only came\ninto use by the “members” themselves much later, when at\nall. \nNames do not only tell us who or what something is; they also tell us\nwho or what something is not. Definitions not only seek to reveal an\ninternal essence; they also draw a line of demarcation between inside\nand outside. It is thus not surprising that names and definitions\noften have their origin in labels appended from without. These labels\nmay subsequently degenerate into stereotypes; or, conversely, they may\nbe positively appropriated and redefined by the group itself. Both of\nthese processes can be seen in the history of the “Kyoto\nSchool.” \nThe name “Kyoto School,” in fact, originated from without;\nor, more precisely speaking, it originated from the fringes of the\nSchool itself. Tosaka Jun (1900–1945), a student of Nishida\nand Tanabe, coined the expression in 1932 in reference to Nishida,\nTanabe and Miki Kiyoshi (1897–1945) as purportedly\nrepresentative of the epitome of “bourgeois philosophy in\nJapan” (see Heisig 2001, 4). Tosaka’s own developing thought had\nan explicitly materialist and Marxist orientation, and in his article\nhe criticized the School as promulgating a bourgeois idealism that\nignores material historical conditions and issues of social praxis.\nTosaka’s critique had an impact on the subsequent development of the\nKyoto School’s philosophies, and ironically Tosaka himself is today\nconsidered by some to belong, together with Miki, to the “left\nwing” of the Kyoto School (see Hattori 2004). \nThe second significant moment in the naming (or\n“labeling”) of the Kyoto School came more clearly from\nwithout, and in an even more politically charged context. As Nishitani\nwas to recollect years later: “The name ‘Kyoto\nSchool’ is a name journalists used in connection with\ndiscussions that friends of mine and I held immediately before and\nduring the war” (NKC XI, 207; see Heisig 2001, 277). Nishitani\nis referring here to a series of symposia that addressed the question\nof the meaning and direction of the Pacific War and another symposium\non the question of “overcoming modernity.” These\ncontroversial symposia will be discussed in subsection 4.3 of this\narticle. In his retrospective comments, penned in 1977, Nishitani goes\non to say that by that time the name “Kyoto School” had\ncome to be used by Americans and others to “indicate purely a\nschool of thought.” \nSince the 1970s the name “Kyoto School” has gradually\nrecovered its underlying philosophical ring, which for several decades\nin Japan (especially outside of Kyoto) had been drowned out by its\npolitical overtones. This recovery happened first of all in the West,\nwhere scholars neglected the political controversies in their\nenthusiastic reception of the School’s philosophies of religion. While\nthe political controversies returned with a vengeance to Western\nacademia a couple of decades later, in a kind of pendulum swing to the\nhypercritical, the initial positive attention from the West had by\nthen helped to rehabilitate the image of the Kyoto School back home in\nJapan. \nFujita Masakatsu suggests that the question of defining the identity\nof the Kyoto School has often been a more pressing issue for Western\nscholars than for the Japanese themselves. He speculates that there\nare two reasons for this. One is that the Kyoto School never really\nhad any noteworthy competing schools of original thought within Japan\nwith which to contrast itself, and over against which to explicitly\ndefine its own identity. The second reason is that, while Westerners\ntend to draw out and focus on the shared general characteristics of\nthe School’s thinkers, usually in contrast with the general\ncharacteristics of Western thought, for Japanese scholars of the Kyoto\nSchool the differences between the various thinkers often appear in\nsharper relief than do their shared commonalities (Fujita 2001,\nii). \nIn any case, just as the formation of the Kyoto School’s ideas\ntook place between Western and Eastern horizons of thought, so has the\nscholarly study and, to some extent, even the defining of the Kyoto\nSchool taken place between scholars in Japan on the one hand and those\nin Europe and North America on the other. Since one of the common\ncharacteristics of the Kyoto School philosophers is their attempt to\nset Japan and their own thought in the context of the wider world, it\nis fitting that, with the increasingly international study of the\nKyoto School, their thought is finally becoming what it always\nintended to be, namely, “Japanese philosophy in the world”\n(see Heisig 2004; Fujita & Davis 2005; Davis & Schroeder &\nWirth 2011). \nAt the start of the twenty-first century, two important volumes\nappeared in Japanese with the name “Kyoto School” in their\ntitles: The Philosophy of the Kyoto School, edited by Fujita\nMasakatsu (2001; translated into English as Fujita 2018), which\nconsists of an anthology of texts by eight Kyoto School thinkers\ntogether with an essay on each one by a contemporary scholar; and\nThe Thought of the Kyoto School, edited by Ōhashi\nRyōsuke (2004), which contains five essays detailing the\ncontroversial history of the name “Kyoto School” as well\nas seven essays on potential contributions of their thought to various\nfields of contemporary philosophy. While the two books complement one\nother in many respects, they nevertheless suggest somewhat different\napproaches to defining the school. \nFujita agrees with Takeda Atsushi’s working definition of the Kyoto\nSchool as: “the intellectual network that was centered on\nNishida and Tanabe, and mutually formed by those who were directly\ninfluenced in both a personal and scholarly manner by them”\n(Fujita 2001, ii and 234–35). Accordingly, Fujita’s book\nfeatures such thinkers as Tosaka and Miki, as well as unanimously\naccepted figures such as Hisamatsu Shinichi (1889–1980) and\nNishitani. As Fujita points out, the relatively open definition of the\nKyoto School as such a scholarly and interpersonal\n“network” has the advantage of highlighting the mutuality\nof the flow of influence between its members, as well as the fact that\n“membership” in the unofficial group did not preclude\nserious disagreement with the thought of Nishida or Tanabe. While\ncritical exchanges did sometimes lead to severed personal relations\n(Nishida and Tanabe infamously stopped speaking to one another), this\nwas not always the case (Nishitani and Tosaka remained on good\npersonal terms despite their political and philosophical differences).\nIn either case mutual criticism was philosophically taken seriously,\nand it frequently provided impetus to further developments in each\nmember’s thought. In this sense, according to Fujita, an acceptance of\nmutual criticism could well be considered one of the defining\ncharacteristics of the School. \nOne point made by Tosaka early on, a point often repeated today, is\nthat without Tanabe’s critical appropriation of Nishida’s\nthought there would be no tradition of the Kyoto School; we would have\nonly successors of “Nishida Philosophy” and not a genuine\nschool of mutually related yet independent thinkers. The question\nremains, however, just how independent a thinker can be with respect\nto Nishida’s thought and still be considered a member of the School.\nFor even when subsequent figures in the School sharply questioned\ncertain aspects of Nishida’s thought, they tended at the same time to\nappropriate and creatively develop other shared concepts and motifs.\n(A movement of self-critical development can in fact be seen in the\nceaseless progression of Nishida’s own thinking. Nishida considered\nhimself to be a “miner” who never managed to stay put in\none place long enough to “refine the ore” he had\nunearthed.) \nHence the Kyoto School, like many other vibrant schools of thought, should\nbe seen as a cluster of original thinkers who, while not uncritically\nsubscribing to any prescribed dogma, nevertheless came to share, and\ndebate, a number of common motifs as well as basic concepts and\nterminology. As we shall see, the most fundamental of their shared and\ndisputed concepts is that of “absolute nothingness,” a\nconcept that has, in fact, most often been used as a thematic axis for\ndefining the School. \nIn contrast to Fujita, Ōhashi explicitly questions the\nappropriateness of defining the Kyoto School merely in terms of a\nnetwork of personal and scholarly relations. According to Ōhashi,\nin order for a group of thinkers to form a genuine\n“school” of philosophy, “there must be the common\npossession or formation of a thought” (Ōhashi 2004, 9). For\nŌhashi, this common thought of the Kyoto School is that of\nabsolute nothingness, and he accordingly suggests the following as a\ndefinition of the School: “a group of philosophers spanning\nseveral generations who developed their thought in several areas of\nphilosophy with the idea of ‘nothingness’ as a\nbasis” (ibid., 10; see Ōhashi 2001, 13). While he does\ninclude Hattori Kenji’s essay on the “left wing of the Kyoto\nSchool” as the opening chapter of his The Thought of the\nKyoto School, previously Ōhashi explicitly excluded Miki\nfrom the School on account of his principally Marxists orientations\n(Ōhashi 1990, 12). (We might note here in passing that, in his\nmajor later period work, The Logic of Imagination, Miki does\naffirm the Nishida-inspired idea that “nothingness is what\ntranscends the subjective and the objective and envelopes them”\n(quoted in Fujita 2011, 315).) \nAmong Western scholars, John Maraldo has most thoroughly probed the\nquestion of Kyoto School identity and membership. He isolates six\ncriteria that scholars have used to include and exclude thinkers from\nthe Kyoto School: (1) connection with Nishida; (2) association with\nKyoto University; (3) stance toward Japanese and Eastern intellectual\ntraditions; (4) stance toward the interrelated matters of Marxism, the\nnation state, and the Pacific War; (5) stance toward Buddhism and\ntoward religion in general; and (6) stance toward the notion of\nabsolute nothingness. Maraldo shows how each one of these criteria\nhave been used in various ways, consciously or unconsciously, since\nthe 1930s to either promote the philosophical significance or\ndisparage the political ideology of the Kyoto School (Maraldo 2005,\n33–38). \nI would add two more related and interrelated criteria. One is an\nessentially ambivalent stance (i.e., neither simple rejection\nnor simple acceptance) toward Western philosophy and the West in\ngeneral. For example, Nishida and others undertake a critical\nreception of Western ontology in order to develop an Eastern\nmeontology or “logic of nothingness,” and attempt to\ncombine a Western “logic of things” with an Eastern\n“logic of heart-mind.” I will discuss such issues in\nsection 3 of this article. \nAnother criterion that could be used to define the School is an\nessentially ambivalent attitude toward Western modernity (or\ntoward modernization as Westernization). A critical stance toward a\nunilateral globalization of Western modernity, a stance which at the\nsame time accepts in part its unavoidability and in some respects even\naffirms its necessity, gave rise to the idea of “overcoming\nmodernity”—an overcoming that would take place not by\nretreating from Western modernity, but by going through and\nbeyond it. This going through and beyond, moreover, would not simply\nbe a matter of going further down the road of linear progress; it\nwould entail a hermeneutical as well as ultimately a (me)ontological\nand existential re-gress, a radical “step back.” For the\nKyoto School, a critical and creative retrieval of the traditions of\nthe East, those of East Asian Mahāyāna Buddhism in\nparticular, is thought to enable the radical religious and\nphilosophical “trans-descendence” necessary to move\nthrough and beyond the limits and problems of Western modernity. \nThis idea of “overcoming modernity” has proven to be both\none of the more stimulating and one of the more controversial\naspects of their thought. For some it promises to contribute an\nimportant East Asian perspective to debates over postmodernism in\nphilosophy and postcolonialism in culture studies. Yet because the\nKyoto School’s ideas of “overcoming modernity” developed\nin conjunction with their wartime political theories, theories which\ntypically saw the nation of Japan as playing a key role in the\nhistorical movement through and beyond Western modernity, it has also\nproven to be one of the more often criticized aspects of their\nthought. (It is noteworthy in this regard that contemporary Japanese\nepigones of [Western] postmodernism have for the most part eschewed\nmaking the connection between their adoption of recent Western\nself-criticism of modernity/Eurocentrism and the Kyoto School’s\nearlier critique of these.) In any case, it is true that even after\nthe Kyoto School ceased formulating the idea of overcoming modernity\nin political terms, the idea lives on in their postwar philosophies of\nreligion and culture. Hence, a radical problematization of Western\nmodernity can be considered an important aspect of their identity as a\nschool of thought. \nAnother significant Western contributor to the question of the Kyoto\nSchool’s identity is James Heisig, who succeeded Jan Van Bragt as the\nhead of the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture in Nagoya, an\ninstitute which has for several decades now been at the center of\ninternational research on the Kyoto School. In his book,\nPhilosophers of Nothingness: An Essay on the Kyoto School,\nHeisig suggests that we follow the lead of Takeuchi Yoshinori\n(1913–2002) and define the School by “triangulating”\nit around the three leading figures of Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani\n(Heisig 2001, 3–7 and 275–78). \nIt is indeed these three figures that form the core of what has become\nknown as the Kyoto School, and in this article I will accordingly\nfocus my attention primarily on them, if also at times on Ueda\nShizuteru as the current leading figure of the School. It should\nnevertheless be kept in mind that these are only four of a much wider\ngroup of original thinkers, some squarely within and some more or less\non the periphery of the Kyoto School. \nŌhashi Ryōsuke’s thesis, advanced already in his landmark\nGerman anthology, Die Philosophie der Kyōto-Schule\n(1990, revised edition 2012; see also Ōhashi and Akitomi 2018),\nis that the Kyoto School should be understood as a group of thinkers\ninvolved in a pluralistic yet cooperative and sustained attempt to\nthink on the basis of an idea of “nothingness” or\n“absolute nothingness.” This distinguishes their thought\nfrom that of traditional Western onto-logy based on the concept of\n“being.” With this definition in mind, Ōhashi lists\nthe central members of the Kyoto School according to generation as\nfollows: Nishida and Tanabe make up the first generation; Hisamatsu,\nNishitani, Kōsaka Masaaki (1900–1969), Shimomura\nToratarō (1900–1995), Kōyama Iwao (1905–1993),\nand Suzuki Shigetaka (1907–1988) make up the second generation;\nand Takeuchi Yoshinori (1913–2002), Tsujimura Kōichi\n(1922–2010), and Ueda Shizuteru make up the third generation.\nElsewhere he also suggests that the psychologist Kimura Bin (b. 1931)\ncould be considered part of the third generation of the School,\nparticularly if we shift the criterion of definition from\ninterpersonal relations to a genealogy of thought (Ōhashi 2004,\n9). \nUeda, who has developed an original philosophy of Zen in relation to\nMeister Eckhart and Nishida, is the most prominent figure of the third\ngeneration. Takeuchi wrote important works on the philosophy of\nreligion from a Shin Buddhist perspective. Tsujimura, who studied\nunder Heidegger as well as under Hisamatsu and Nishitani, has\nprovocatively and influentially written on Heidegger’s thought from a\nZen and Kyoto School perspective. Abe Masao (1915–2006), a\nformer student of Hisamatsu’s, was an important representative of the\nKyoto School and contributor to inter-religious dialogue in North\nAmerica, although he is somewhat less well known in Japan itself. If\nwe were to view the Kyoto School as living past its third generation,\nŌhashi Ryōsuke (b. 1944), a prolific philosopher in his own\nright, whose works in both Japanese and German address a broad range\nof philosophical issues, would undoubtedly count as a central figure\nof its fourth generation. Other recent affiliates of the School, who\ncould be seen as belonging to its fourth generation, include Hase\nShōtō, Horio Tsutomu, Ōmine Akira, Fujita Masakatsu,\nMori Tetsurō, Hanaoka (Kawamura) Eiko, Matsumura Hideo, Nakaoka\nNarifumi, Okada Katsuaki, and Keta Masako. If the\nSchool shows promise of living on to future generations, it is with\ncurrently active Japanese scholars such as Akitomi Katsuya, Minobe\nHitoshi, Itabashi Yūjin, Uehara Mayuko, Inoue Katsuhito, Mine Hideki, Kosaka Kunitsugu, Tanaka Yū, and Tanaka Kyūbun,\nand as well as with a number of Japanese and non-Japanese philosophers living outside of Japan, some of\nwhom have studied extensively with members of the third and fourth\ngenerations of the School. \nWe appear to be at a turning point in the history of the Kyoto School,\nas is reflected in current retrospective attempts to define it. With\nUeda’s and then Hase’s retirements from Kyoto University, on the one\nhand, and with the creation in 1996 of a Department of the History of\nJapanese Philosophy at Kyoto University (see the website listed below)\nunder the head of Fujita Masakatsu and now Uehara Mayuko on the other,\nthe Kyoto School is becoming as much an object of scholarship as it is\na living tradition. However, as with most schools of philosophy, the\nline between critical scholarship and creative development is hardly a\nclear one, and in practice the retrospective study of the Kyoto School\noften blends together with its further unfolding as a still vibrant\nschool of thought. \nIt is also important to point out that today in Japan the Kyoto School\nis not only studied in Kyoto. Since the appearance of Tokyo-based\nphilosopher Nakamura Yūjiō’s first book on Nishida in 1983,\nNishida and the Kyoto School have steadily begun to receive serious\nattention once again from scholars and students in areas of Japan\nbeyond Kyoto. Worth special mention in this regard is Kosaka\nKunitsugu, whose lucid and prolific scholarship on Nishida and others\nhas done a great deal for the sympathetic yet sober textual analysis\nof the Kyoto School. The creation of the Nishida Philosophy\nAssociation in 2003 (see the website listed below) has helped\ninaugurate a new era of cooperative exchange between scholars from\nvarious areas of Japan as well as from abroad. \nOne final point on the question of membership: consideration should\nalso be given to those who could be referred to as “related\nthinkers” or “associate members” of the Kyoto\nSchool. The widest understandings (or\n misunderstandings[3])\n of the Kyoto School include in it a number of thinkers who have a\nmore or less peripheral relation to the inner circle of the School. On\nthe one hand, there is the case of the well-known Zen figure, D. T.\nSuzuki (Suzuki Daisetsu) (1870–1966). Suzuki maintained a long\npersonal relationship with Nishida since their days as schoolmates.\nSuzuki not only helped introduce the young Nishida to the practice of\nZen, his articulation of Mahāyāna Buddhist thought is also\nacknowledged by Nishida as having influenced the formation of certain\nkey ideas in his last essay on the philosophy of religion. But\nSuzuki—who is justifiably famous in his own right for, among\nother things, helping introduce Zen to the West—was neither\ntrained as a philosopher nor was he associated with Kyoto University;\nand thus he is perhaps best thought of as a “closely related\nthinker” to the School. \nThen there are the cases of Watsuji Tetsurō (1889–1960) and\nKuki Shūzō (1888–1941). Both of these philosophers\nwere brought to Kyoto University by Nishida, and both developed\nphilosophies which were more or less influenced by Nishida’s thought\n(see Maraldo 2005, 34 and 52). And yet, both their thought and their\nactivities remained too independent to count them among the inner\ncircle of the School. It should be kept in mind, however, that these\ntwo “associates” in particular are first rate philosophers\nin their own right, whose original work outshines that of many of the\nless original though full-fledged members of the School. Watsuji’s\nnovel theory of “culture and climate”\n(fūdo), together with his major work on the ethics of\n“betweenness” (aidagara), and Kuki’s combination\nof logical rigor and existential insight in his major writings on the\nproblem of contingency, together with his provocative works on\nJapanese aesthetics (notably his hermeneutical phenomenology of\n“iki”), have each made lasting contributions to\nphilosophy and are worthy of international scholarly attention. \nFinally, there is the matter of thinkers who have developed their\nideas more or less under the influence of Nishida and other members of\nthe Kyoto School. A complete list of this group of “influenced\nthinkers” would be long, but it would include such names as\nTakahashi Satomi, Takizawa Katsumi, Mutai Risaku, Yuasa Yasuo, Kimura\nBin, Sakabe Megumi, Nakamura Yūjirō, and Noe Keiichi. A\nnumber of non-philosophers, such as the world-famous architect\nAndō Tadao (Tadao Ando), who designed the Ishikawa Nishida Kitaro\nMuseum of Philosophy (see the website listed below), have also been\ninfluenced by Nishida and the Kyoto School. \nHaving discussed issues of definition and membership of the Kyoto\nSchool, we are now prepared to pursue the question of what unifies\ntheir thought as a school of philosophy. I will here follow the\nsuggestion of Ōhashi, Nishitani, and other representatives of the\nKyoto School itself, and focus on the shared—and at times\ndisputed—idea of “absolute nothingness”\n (zettai-mu).[4] \nNishitani wrote the following with regard to Nishida and Tanabe:\n“[Their] philosophies share a distinctive and common basis that\nsets them apart from traditional Western philosophy: absolute\nnothingness. … Clearly the idea of absolute nothingness came to\nawareness in the spirituality of the East; but the fact that it has\nalso been posited as a foundation for philosophical thought represents\na new step virtually without counterpart in the history of Western\nphilosophy” (NKC IX, 225–26; Nishitani 1991, 161). \n“First philosophy” in the Western tradition is ontology,\nwhich asks the question of “being qua being,” and tends to\nanswer this question either in terms of the most universal\n“being-ness” or in terms of the “highest\nbeing.” For Aristotle, the primary category of being is\n“substance,” ambiguously thought in its primary sense as\nthe particular entity (e.g. Socrates) and in its secondary sense the\nuniversal that makes that entity what it is (e.g. human being), and\nthe highest being was the “unmoved mover.” Greek ontology\nlater influenced the Christian theological tradition to think of God\nas the “highest being,” such that the dual threads of the\nWestern tradition as a whole took shape as what Heidegger calls\n“onto-theology.” Hence, the fundamental philosophical\nquestion of the onto-theological mainstream of the West is,\n“What is being?” On the other hand, the counter-question\nwhich the Kyoto School finds in the East is, “What is\nnothingness?” In place of an ontology, first philosophy in the\nEast is more often a “meontology”: a philosophy of\nnon-being or nothingness. \nPerhaps we should say “mu-logy” rather than\n“meontology”; for, strictly speaking, the Greek\nmeon, “non-being,” should be translated into\nJapanese as hi-u. What I am translating as\n“nothingnesss,” mu, is written with a single\ncharacter rather than as a negation (hi) of being\n(u). This is crucial since the nothingness with which they\nare concerned is not the simple negation or privation of being. It is\ncloser to what Heidegger means by “being.” Attentive to\nwhat he calls the “ontological difference” between being\n(das Sein) and beings (das Seiende), Heidegger notes\nthat with respect to beings, understood as determinate things, being\ncan only appear as “no-thing.” We fail to attend to the\nno-thing of being when we think only of things, and especially when we\nthink of thinking as a mere calculation of predetermined beings.\nHeidegger thus calls “the nothing” (das Nichts)\nthe “veil of being.” Being cannot but appear to us as\nnothing, insofar as we know only of beings. Yet it is das\nSein or das Nichts which grants an open place, a\nclearing (Lichtung), for beings to show themselves in the\nfirst place. But this clearing lets beings be by withdrawing itself\nfrom view. Just as “nature (phusis) loves to\nhide” (Heraclitus), being lets determinate beings come to\npresence by withdrawing its indeterminate abundance into absence or\nself-concealment (see Heidegger 1975, Vol. 9, 103–22; and Vol.\n65, 246–47). \nTanabe studied with Heidegger in the early 1920s. (In fact, upon\nreturning to Japan in 1924, Tanabe was the first scholar in the world\nto write an article on Heidegger’s thought.) When he later wrote the\nfollowing, Tanabe no doubt had Heidegger’s 1929 “What is\nMetaphysics?” lecture in mind: “All science needs to take\nsome entity or other as its object of study. The point of contact is\nalways in being, not in nothing. The discipline that has to do with\nnothingness is philosophy” (THZ VI, 156; see Heisig 2001,\n121). \nHeidegger was of course not the first Western philosopher to ask after\nthat which is radically other than beings or “beyond\nbeing” as\n such.[5]\n For example, Tanabe could have also found support for the idea that\nphilosophy investigates nothingness in the following passage from\nHegel: “Das Erste der Philosophie aber ist, das\nabsolute Nichts zu erdenken” [Yet the first task of\nphilosophy is to conceive of absolute nothingness] (quoted\nfrom Hegel’s “Glauben und Wissen” in Ōhashi 1984,\n203). The Kyoto School might even be thought of as recovering a\nsuggestion from one of the first Presocratic philosophers,\nAnaximander: namely, to think finite beings as determinations, or\ndelimitations, of “the indefinite” or “the\nunlimited” (to apeiron). \nMoreover, as Kyoto School thinkers frequently do point out, Christian\nnegative theologians and mystics, most notably Meister Eckhart, at\ntimes make use of the notion of “the nothing” to refer to\nthat which transcends all concepts and all oppositions. For Eckhart,\n“nothing” (niht) was one way of indicating the\n“Godhead” (gōtheit) beyond “God”\ndelimited as a personal being (see Eckehart 1963, 328). Niht\nhere is an expression, at the limits of language, which attempts to\nindicate “the nothingness of indistinct fullness from which flow\n… all oppositions and relations” (Schürmann 1978,\n168). Eckhart speaks of a breakthrough, not only beyond the ego, but\nalso beyond God Himself, a breakthrough, that is, to an abyssal\nGodhead understood as “the silent desert into which no\ndistinction ever gazed, of Father, Son, or Holy Ghost” (Eckehart\n1963, 316). Analogously, Nishida writes that “when we truly\nenter thoroughly into the consciousness of absolute nothingness, there\nis neither I nor God” (NKZ V, 182; see Nishida 1958, 137). \nNishitani affirms Eckhart’s intimations of a Godhead of absolute\nnothingness, even though he notes that this is “markedly distant\nfrom orthodox Christian faith,” which limits the concept of\nnothingness to the relative nothingness expressed in the\nnihilum of creatio ex nihilo, that is, to the\nabsolute privation of being out of which the highest being creates\nlesser beings (NKC X, 75; Nishitani 1982, 66; also see NKC VII). Yet\nNishitani’s student and Eckhart scholar Ueda Shizuteru, despite\nprofound appreciation for Eckhart’s thought and its nearness to Zen,\nargues in the end that Eckhart’s nothingness, like that of negative\ntheology in general, still points to an inexpressibly higher\nbeing (see USS VIII, 146). Critically adapting Heidegger’s\nexpression, we might say that the nothing is still understood as\n“the veil” of this inexpressibly higher being. Both\nNishitani and Ueda ultimately look to Zen for a nothingness so\nabsolute that, in thoroughly negating any traces of opposition to\nbeings (i.e., as a higher being transcending worldly beings), it is\nparadoxically found fully in the concrete facts and activities of the\nhere and now (see USS VIII, 5ff.). \nŌhashi stresses, however, that neither the Buddhist tradition nor\nthe Kyoto School should be thought of as having a patent on the\nradical “thinking of nothingness.” In fact, he argues,\n“this thought slowly came to the fore within Western philosophy\nitself,” a process that indeed set the stage for Kyoto School\ncontributions to contemporary philosophy (Ōhashi 2004,\n12–13). Nishitani had already explored a number of resonant\nnotions of nothingness, not only in the Neoplatonic and Christian\nmystical traditions, but also in 19th and 20th\ncentury Western philosophers such as Nietzsche and Heidegger (see NKC\nVIII; Nishitani 1990). And yet, here again Nishitani finds residues of\nan ontological bias, where a kind of “relative\nnothingness” is posited as either a simple negation of or as a\nveil for being. Nishitani ultimately concludes that Nietzsche\nsucceeded only in expressing a “standpoint of relative absolute\nnothingness”; and even in Heidegger, he critically suggests,\n“traces of the representation of nothingness as some\n‘thing’ that is nothingness still remain” (NKC X, 75\nand 108; Nishitani 1982, 66 and\n 96).[6] \nIn any case, it is fair to say that the Kyoto School thinkers\ngenerally consider the purest sources for the idea of absolute\nnothingness to lie in the traditions of the East. Hisamatsu went so\nfar as to speak of absolute nothingness as “oriental\nnothingness” (Hisamatsu 1960); though it is important to bear in\nmind that his claim is that this idea was first clearly\ndiscovered in the traditions of East. Absolute nothingness is\nby no means only relevant to Eastern cultures, anymore than in 1500 CE\nthe earth was only round in the West. Moreover, if the idea\nof absolute nothingness “came to awareness in the spirituality\nof the East,” as Nishitani says, the philosophy of\nabsolute nothingness is generally considered to be the Kyoto School’s\nown contribution to the contemporary world of thought opened up by the\nmeeting of East and West. \nNishida—who could hardly be accused of underestimating what\nJapan had to learn from Western philosophy—also spoke at times\nin very general terms of Eastern nothingness in contrast with Western\nbeing. In his essay, “The Types of Culture of the Classical\nPeriods of East and West Seen from a Metaphysical Perspective,”\nhe wrote: “How then are we to distinguish between the types of\nculture of the West and East from a metaphysical point of view? I\nthink we can do this by dividing them into that [i.e., the culture of\nthe West] which considers the ground of reality to be being, and that\n[i.e., the culture of the East] which considers this ground to be\nnothingness.” In Greek philosophy, he goes on to say,\n“that which has form and determination was regarded as the\nreal”; or even, as in Plato, reality, that which has true being,\nwas understood as the Forms. Judeo-Christian culture, however\nradically different in various ways it was from Greek culture, and\ndespite negative theology’s indications of a Deus absconditus\nas a kind of nothingness, nevertheless primarily considered the\nperson of God as “the most perfect being” to be\nthe basis of reality. In radical contrast to both the Greek and\nJudeo-Christian origins of Western culture, Indian culture, like that\nof China and Japan, took “the profoundest idea of nothingness as\nits basis” (NKZ VII, 429–33; see Nishida 1970,\n237–40). \nIn the closing lines of the preface to his 1926 book, From That\nWhich Acts to That Which Sees, a book many scholars view as the\nbeginning of “Nishidan Philosophy” proper, we find the\nfollowing famous and programmatic lines: “It goes without saying\nthat there is much to admire, and much to learn from, in the\nimpressive achievements of Western culture, which thought form as\nbeing and the giving of form as good. However, does there not lie\nhidden at the base of our Eastern culture, preserved and passed down\nby our ancestors for several thousand years, something which sees the\nform of the formless and hears the voice of the voiceless? Our hearts\nand minds endlessly seek this something; and it is my wish to provide\nthis quest with a philosophical foundation” (NKZ IV, 6). \nBefore looking more specifically at how Nishida and other members of\nthe Kyoto School attempt to give philosophical form to the formless,\nit will be helpful to look at some of the threads in Eastern\ntraditions on which the Kyoto School thinkers are explicitly and\nimplicitly drawing as they weave their texts on absolute\nnothingness. \nTheir explicit references are primarily to Mahāyāna\nBuddhism, especially to the East Asian Buddhist schools of Zen\n(predominantly the Rinzai tradition but also notably Dōgen of\nSōtō) and Pure Land (predominantly Shinran’s Shin)\nBuddhism. The key Sanskrit term in Mahāyāna Buddhism here is\nśūnyatā (“emptiness”;\nkū in Japanese). With the noteworthy exception of the\nlater Nishitani, however, the Kyoto School tends to favor the Chinese\nglyph mu (“nothingness”; wu in Chinese),\nwhich is found predominantly in Zen, and which reflects the early\nattempt to “match terms” with Daoism in the translation\nand interpretive development of Buddhism in China. Let us briefly\nexamine both of these Asian sources for the Kyoto School’s\nphilosophies of absolute nothingness, śūnyatā\nand\n wu/mu.[7] \nIn Mahāyāna Buddhism śūnyatā refers\nfirst of all to the fact that all things come into being in\n“interdependent origination” (Sanskrit:\npratītya-samutpāda; Japanese: engi), and\nthey are therefore “empty” of any independent substantial\nself-nature or “own-being” (Sanskrit:\nsvabhāva). This thought is closely tied to the basic\nBuddhist thesis of “no-self” or “non-ego”\n(Sanskrit: anātman; Japanese: muga). All\nbeings, including the ego, are interconnected and in flux.\nPsychologically, śūnyatā refers also to the\nreleasement from all attachment to beings, from all\nreification and willful appropriation of them. Such attachments are\nboth based on and in turn support the primary attachment to the\nfabricated ego, since the ego both strives to possess and is\nunwittingly possessed by its reification of beings. To awaken to the\nemptiness of all things, to their lack of substantial own-being or\negoity (Japanese: shogyōmuga), therefore, is to free oneself from both an ego-centered and reified view of things as well as from the illusion of\nthe substantial ego itself. \nYet, if the movement of negation stops here at a one-sided\nnegation of being (i.e., at negation of the illusory independent\nsubstantial reality of things and the ego), then the idea of\n“emptiness” is not itself\n emptied.[8]\n That would leave us with either a pessimistic nihilism or, ironically,\na reified view of śūnyatā itself. These\nare what the Buddhist tradition calls\n“śūnyatā-sickness” (Japanese:\nkūbyō). True śūnyatā must\nbe understood to dynamically negate the very opposition of being and\n(relative) nothingness (see Nakamura 1975, Vol. 1, 278). Hence, in\nMahāyāna we find an explicit return—through a\n“great negation” of a reified misunderstanding of\nbeing—to a “great affirmation” of a non-reified\nunderstanding of being. Emptiness thoroughly understood is nothing\nseparate from or opposed to “being” properly understood.\nAs the often chanted lines of the Heart Sutra put it:\n“[phenomenal] form is emptiness; emptiness is also [phenomenal]\nform; emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than\nemptiness” (see Bercholz & Kohn 1993, 155). The famous\nMahāyāna Buddhist philosopher of\nśūnyatā Nāgārjuna (ca. 150–250\nCE) went so far as to provocatively state: “The limits (i.e.,\nrealm) of nirvāna are the limits of\nsamsāra. Between the two, also, there is not the\nslightest difference whatsoever” (Inada 1993, 158). In other\nwords, nirvāna is neither a nihilistic extinction of nor\na transcendent escape from the phenomenal world\n(samsāra); it is rather an enlightened manner of\nbeing-in-the-world here and now (see Garfield 1995, 332). This radical\nreaffirmation of the phenomenal world was particularly stressed in\nEast Asian developments of Mahāyāna Buddhism, where we find\nsuch remarkably affirmative phrases as: “true emptiness,\nmarvelous being” (Japanese: shinkū-myōu). \nIn his mature writings Nishitani explicitly employs the\nMahāyāna term śūnyatā (even though\nhe never disavows the term Nishida coined, “absolute\nnothingness”) in his attempt to think a way beyond both the\nexacerbated attachment to being and the reactive nihilism that\ntogether plague the modern world (see Ueda 2011a). Nishitani writes as\nfollows: On the one hand, śūnyatā or emptiness\ncan be termed “an absolute negativity, inasmuch as it is a\nstandpoint that has negated and thereby transcended nihility, which\nwas itself the transcendence-through-negation of all being.” In\nthis sense, “emptiness can well be described as\n‘outside’ of and absolutely ‘other’ than the\nstandpoint shackled to being, provided we avoid the misconception that\nemptiness is some ‘thing’ distinct from being and\nsubsisting ‘outside’ it.” On the other hand, then,\nemptiness is truly emptiness “only when it empties itself even\nof the standpoint that represents it as some ‘thing’ that\nis emptiness. … [True emptiness] is to be realized as something\nunited to and self-identical with being” (NKC X, 109–10;\nNishitani 1982, 97). Following in the wake of Nishida’s topological\nthinking of absolute nothingness (see subsection 3.3 below), Nishitani\nalso thinks of śūnyatā as a\n“place” or “field” wherein beings can appear\nas they truly are in their proper basis or “home-ground”\n(moto). \nThe idea of a nothingness that radically transcends, or underlies,\nboth being and its simple negation can also be traced back to\npre-Buddhist Chinese thought. A recent Chinese scholar laments the\nphilosophical ambiguity inherent in the Chinese character wu\n(nothingness). He writes that “in Chinese\n‘wu’ can mean both the contrasting pair of\n‘you’ [i.e., ‘being’] and the\nmetaphysical source of both ‘you’ and\n‘wu’” (Zhang 2002, 150). In the terminology\nof the Kyoto School, the former sense of wu (mu in\nJapanese) is a matter of “relative nothingness,” while the\nlatter sense is akin to what they call “absolute\nnothingness.” The latter sense of wu is expressed in\nchapter 40 of the Laozi (Daodejing) as follows:\n“The myriad things under heaven are generated from being. Being\nis generated from nothingness (wu).” This unnamable\nnon-dualistic source of all being and relative non-being is also\nreferred to as the Way (dao). Of the latter it is said, in\nchapter 14 of the Laozi: “It is called the shapeless\nshape, the image of no-thing” (see Izutsu 2001, 50–51 and\n104). It is not hard to link this thought with Nishida’s professed\nintention of giving philosophical foundation to the “form of the\nformless” that lies at the heart of the traditions of the\nEast. \nIn the Daoist tradition we also find an idea of nothingness used in\nthe context of radically emptying the mind in order to attune the\nfinite self to the\n in-finite[9]\n rhythm of the Way. The Zhuangzi speaks in this regard of the\npractice of “sitting down and forgetting everything” and\nof “being empty like a mirror” (see Watson 1968, 90 and\n97). When Zen talks of returning to one’s “original face before\none’s parents were born,” we find the Daoist ideas of\n“forgetting the ego” and “returning to the\nroot” linked together with the Mahāyāna Buddhist\nnotion of the “original purity of the mind.” The original\nbrightness and purity of the mind, which lies hidden beneath the\nclouds of defiling passion, is also frequently expressed in\nMahāyāna texts with the analogy of a mirror that is able to\nspontaneously reflect the world without egoistic discriminations. \nZen presumably inherits this analogy of the original mind as mirror\nfrom both Mahāyāna and Daoist sources. In the traditional\nedition of The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch,\nhowever, all residues of dualistic discrimination—including\nthose that remain even in the notion of a mirror that needs to be\ncontinually wiped clean of impurities—are swept away in the\nfamous lines: “Originally there is not a single thing”\n(Chinese: benlai wu-yi-wu; Japanese: honrai\nmu-ichi-motsu). In this quintessential Zen expression are wedded\ntogether the meontological and psychological senses of\nwu/mu: a rejection of an ontology of independent\nsubstances, a declaration of an originary (self-negating) nothingness,\nand an expression of a radical freedom from egoistic attachment as well as freedom for spontaneous creativity and compassion. \nIn Zen we find the Mahāyāna Buddhist notion of emptiness and\nthe Daoist notion of nothingness fully intertwined and developed into\na practice of living both completely unattached and completely engaged\nin the world of “true emptiness, marvelous being.” In the\nfamous wu or mu kōan that opens the\nGateless Barrier, Wumen (Mumon) urges those who wish to reach\nenlightenment, that is, those who wish to pass through the\n“barrier of the gate of nothingness,” to concentrate their\nentire life force on this wu (mu), taking care to\nunderstand it neither as “nihilistic nothingness” nor\n“in terms of being and non-being” (Nishimura 1994, 22; see\nCleary 1999, 71). This was the kōan that Nishida finally\npassed after nearly a decade of intense practice of Zen (see Yusa\n2002, 45ff.). And as Nishida confided many years later to Nishitani,\nit was from early on his “impossible desire” to somehow\nbring Zen and philosophy together (NKZ XIX, 224–25; see Davis\n2004b, 256ff.). \nBesides contrasting Western being with Eastern nothingness, in his\nlater writings Nishida also at times makes a broad distinction between\na Western “logic of things” and an Eastern “logic of\nthe heart-mind (kokoro).” While Western thought tends\nto begin with an objective logic of substances (be these physical or\nmental), he claims that in Buddhism one can find the germ of a logic\nof the heart-mind, even if traditionally this remained largely at the\nlevel of an expression of personal experience rather than being fully\ndeveloped into a genuinely philosophical logic (see Nishida 1964,\n356). (Scholars of Buddhism may want to argue that it was Nishida’s\nown knowledge of Buddhism that remained too much at the level of\npersonal experience, rather than the sophisticated teachings of the\nMādhyamaka, Yogācāra, Tiantai, and Huayan traditions of\nMahāyāna philosophy.) \nIn any case, in the development of Nishida’s thought,\n“being” is thought of in terms of the objectivity of\ndeterminate things, “relative nothingness” is understood\nas a mere privation or simple negation of being, and an enveloping\nsense of “nothingness” is provisionally associated with a\nkind of transcendental subjectivity of consciousness or the\nheart-mind. Ultimately, however, Nishida comes to posit absolute\nnothingness as the “place” (basho) that embraces\nboth subjective (noetic) and objective (noematic) dimensions\nof reality. Thus, he relegates not only privation of being but also\nsubjective nothingness, in the sense of the “field of\nconsciousness,” to a type of “relative\n nothingness.”[10] \nIn 1934 Nishida writes: “Reality is being and at the same time\nnothingness; it is being-and-nothingness [u-soku-mu],\nnothingness-and-being; it is both subjective and objective, noetic and\nnoematic. Reality is the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, and\nthus the self-identity of what is absolutely contradictory. Or rather,\nit is not that [the separate spheres of] subjectivity and objectivity\ncome to unite, and then we first have reality. [The opposition of]\nsubjectivity and objectivity must instead be thought from out of a\ndynamically dialectical reality that is self-determining” (NKZ\nVII, 441; see Nishida 1970, 29). Reality, as the dialectical\n“self-determination of absolute nothingness,” is in\nNishida’s later works understood as a dynamic “identity of the\nabsolute contradiction” between subjective (relative)\nnothingness and objective being. Absolute nothingness is the temporal\nand spatial “place” wherein individual persons and things\ndetermine one another in their mutual interactions. \nThe “place of absolute nothingess” (zettai-mu no\nbasho) first became the central concept of Nishida’s thought in\nthe mid-1920s, though he continued to develop and rethink the idea up\nuntil his last completed essay in 1945, “The Logic of Place and\nthe Religious World-View.” Nishida first explicitly worked out\nan idea of absolute nothingness in his 1926 book, From That Which\nActs to That Which Sees (NKZ IV), a book which inaugurated his\nmiddle-period of thought. In this work, which includes an important\nessay entitled “Place” (“Basho”),\nNishida’s topological reasoning develops in rough outline as\n follows[11]: \nJust as all events must “take place” somewhere, all beings\nmust be situated in some place. Beings always exist in relation to\nother beings, and any relation requires a third term, namely, the\nplace or medium wherein they are related. In other words, for A and B\nto be related, there must be some place, C, in which their relation is\nsituated. To begin with, we can understand this C as the spatial\n“context” in which objects are situated in relation to one\nanother. But the context in which things are defined is more than\nspatial; a thing is not only here as opposed to there. Things are\ndetermined according to a number of criteria, each of which operates\nwithin its own field of judgment. Hence, the place C can be further\nunderstood as a “category” of judgment, such as the\nquality “color.” Red and blue are revealed, and contrasted\nwith one another, as colors within the same color field. \nIn order to let concrete things reveal themselves yet more fully,\nhowever, we should think of C as “consciousness.” Our\nminds are able to correlate various categories of judgment, such as\ncolor, size, shape, location, etc., and therefore to perceive\nindividual things as composed of unique combinations of various\nqualities and relations. For example, we are conscious of a certain\nthing as a round, soft, red, sweet, apple sitting on a table. The\nfield of consciousness is the field in which these different\ncategories are unified in the perception and judgment of the qualities\nof a particular thing in relation to other particular things and their\nqualities. \nUltimately, however, there is a crucial limit to the subjective\n“field of consciousness.” As Kant demonstrated, subjective\nconsciousness cannot reflect things as they are in themselves, but\nonly as they appear when schematized according to subjective\ncategories. What, then, is the ultimate place wherein the encounter\nbetween subjects and objects takes place, wherein persons and things\ncoexist? According to Nishida, this must be the place wherein persons\nand things not only undergo changes in accidental categorical\nqualities, but wherein they essentially and existentially “come\nto be and pass away.” It is the place, not just of intellectual\njudgments, but of birth and death. This ultimate “groundless\nground,” which “envelopes” all beings, yet which\ndoes so in such a way that lets them contain their own principle of\nself-determination, Nishida calls “the place of true\nnothingness.” Although in no sense a determinate being, neither\nis this place of true or absolute nothingness a mere static vacuity.\nIt must be thought of as both the epistemic source of consciousness\nand the ontological origin of beings. \nAlthough Nishida comes to the idea of the place of absolute\nnothingness most directly through his confrontations with Kant and\nNeo-Kantianism, he does not shy from thinking this place in\nmetaphysical as well as epistemological terms: nothingness is not\nmerely a reflective, but is also a creative principle (NKZ IV,\n238–39). As he writes much later, “absolute nothingness at\nonce transcends everything and is that by which everything is\nconstituted” (NKZ IX, 6). And yet, Nishida repeatedly tells us\nthat, as no-thing outside of or other than the place of the coming to\nbe and passing away of truly individual beings, absolute nothingness\nis not to be thought of as a “transcendent\nbeing.” Nor is it to be understood as the processional unfolding\nof a “potential being,” that is to say, as a kind of\nHegelian “world Spirit” with its own cunning reason at\nwork behind the scenes of its historical march toward\nself-realization. The absolute, according to Nishida, must be thought\nof as nothingness in order to distinguish it from all ontologies that\nwould reduce the uniqueness and autonomy of truly individual beings\neither to a transcendent being or to an underlying teleological\nprocess. \nOne of the driving concerns behind Nishida’s repeated insistence that\nthe absolute be thought of in the meontological terms of a formless,\nindeterminate place of absolute nothingness, is that only therein can\nself-determining and irreducibly singular individuals be given their\ndue (see Davis 2011b). All ontologies of universal being fail to allow\nfor the existence of the “true individual,” or for the\ngenuine encounter between such individuals. Since “there is no\nuniversal [of being] whatsoever that subsumes the I and the\nthou” (NKZ VI, 381), the locus of genuine interpersonal\nencounter must be thought of in terms of the place of absolute\nnothingness (see Davis 2014). \nIt should be pointed out that the Japanese term for\n“absolute,” zettai, literally means a\n“severing of opposition,” which implies the sense of\n“without an opposing other.” The contrasting term is\nsōtai, which indicates “relativity” in the\nliteral sense of “mutual opposition.” The true absolute\nmust embrace, rather than stand over against, the relative. The\nabsolute, therefore, must not oppose itself to relative beings;\nrather, its self-determination must be such as to allow their mutually\nautonomous relations to take place. According to Nishida, it is only a\nphilosophy of the place of absolute nothingness that can do justice to\nthe notion of the absolute as well as account for both the autonomy\nand the mutual relativity of individuals. \nWhile on the one hand Nishida becomes increasingly concerned with\nallowing for radical interpersonal alterity within the place of\nabsolute nothingness, on the other hand he also consistently argues\nfrom early on that “consciousness” should not be thought\nto entail an unbridgeable epistemological subject-object split.\nAlthough he initially adopted, and adapted, the notion of “pure\nexperience” from William James to express this nondual basis of\nknowledge (see Nishida 1990), Nishida later drops this expression in\nfavor of the notion of “self-awareness” (jikaku).\nAccording to Nishida, self-awareness can be defined as a “self\nreflecting itself within itself” (NKZ IV,\n 215).[12]\n Since absolute nothingness is not a “self” in the sense\nof a subject standing over against an object, any more than it is an\nego with its own interested categories of perception, the\nself-awareness of absolute nothingness must be that of a “seeing\nwithout a seer” or a “knowing without a knower.”\n“Since there is no-thing that reflects, it is like a mirror\nreflecting the mirror itself” (ibid., 181). \nIn Nishida’s middle period, the paradigm for knowing is a “pure\nseeing” (tada miru) beyond all acting and volition.\nNishida claims that as finite individuals we can approach this ideal\nby way of thoroughly negating or emptying the ego. “By truly\nemptying the self, the field of consciousness can reflect an object\njust as it is” (NKZ IV, 221). The self reaches the place of\nabsolute nothingness, and therefore first truly comes into contact\nwith other beings, by way of thoroughly emptying itself in a movement\nof “immanent transcendence” that takes it back\nthrough the depths of the field of consciousness. \nIn his last completed text, “The Logic of Place and the\nReligious Worldview,” Nishida most fully developed the religious\nimplications of the idea of absolute nothingness. There he suggests\nthat absolute nothingness is the best way to understand God or the\nabsolute, which he defines as that which “contains its own\nabsolute self-negation within itself” (NKZ XI, 397). As absolute\nnothingness, God is the dynamic principle of affirmation by way of\nabsolute self-negation. The true absolute essentially negates its\ntranscendent divinity and expresses itself in the forms of the\n relative.[13] \nNishida insists that this idea of God can be understood no more in\nterms of an immanent pantheism than in terms of a transcendent theism.\nIt may perhaps best be called “panentheism”; but for\nNishida this too remains a static term of “objective\nlogic” and fails to capture the necessity of thinking God as\nboth irreducibly transcendent and thoroughly immanent. As\nNishida is fond of saying, God or the Buddha is “immanently\ntranscendent.” It is the paradoxical logic one finds in the\nPrajñāpāramitā Sutras of\nMahāyāna Buddhism (i.e., what D. T. Suzuki called the\n“logic of soku-hi,” a logic of “is and is\nnot”) that Nishida thinks most profoundly expresses the\n“absolute dialectic” of the divine as the dynamic\nprinciple of absolute nothingness (NKZ XI, 399; see Nishida 1987,\n69–71). \nIf we as finite relative beings can and do touch the infinite\nabsolute, it is only by way of a mutual self-negation. Nishida calls\nthis mutual self-negation “inverse correspondence”\n(gyakutaiō). By way of radically emptying ourselves, we\ncan touch that which is the radical origin of self-emptying, the\nabsolute as an essentially self-negating absolute nothingness.\nAccording to Nishida, an immanent principle of self-negation is, in\nfact, the very essence of life. “True life (seimei)\nmust contain within itself an absolute nothingness, a [principle of]\nabsolute negation” (NKZ VIII, 341). It is such a life that can\ntruly be self-determining as a “creative element of a creative\nworld.” \nIn his middle period, inaugurated by the first formulations of the\nidea of “the place of absolute nothingness” in From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees, Nishida’s thought was\ncharacterized by a shift from his earlier voluntarism to a kind of\nintuitionism of pure seeing without a seer (see NKZ IV, 3–6). In\nhis later period, however, Nishida’s epistemology became much more\ndynamic and dialectical; rather than “pure seeing,” his\nkey epistemological phrase then becomes “action-intuition”\n(kōi-teki chokkan). Although self-emptying still plays a\nvital role, this is understood not as preparation for a passive\nintuition, but rather as an active process of “seeing a thing by\nbecoming it.” In other words, intuition happens only in the\nmidst of the dialectical process of acting upon and in turn being\nacted upon by things. \nIn his later period, the place of absolute nothingness is accordingly\nreconceived much more dynamically as the “self-determination of\nthe dialectical world,” a world which continually moves\naccording to the principle of “from created to creating.”\nThe absolute finds expression now only in the midst of the mutual\ninteraction of individuals and things, and true individuals are both\ndetermined by and “counter-determine” (gyaku-gentei\nsuru) the movement of the dialectical world (see NKZ VII, 305ff.;\nVIII, 313–14). Although one can trace an immanent unfolding of\nNishida’s thought in this direction, it is also clear that a major\nimpetus for his dialectical development of the idea of absolute\nnothingness can be found in the criticism he received from his junior\ncolleague, Tanabe Hajime. \nIt is Tanabe’s declaration of partial independence from Nishida’s\nthought in an essay written in 1930, “Requesting Instruction\nfrom Professor Nishida” (THZ IV, 305–328), that many see\nas the origin of the Kyoto School as more than a group of disciples of\n“Nishidan Philosophy.” In this essay Tanabe sharply\ncriticizes Nishida’s middle-period philosophy of the “place of\nabsolute nothingness,” claiming that it falls into kind of\nPlotinian “emanationism” that ultimately rests on a\nreligious or mystical intuition. For Tanabe, this posed two serious\nproblems for a genuine philosophy of absolute nothingness. \nTo begin with, in crossing the line between philosophical reason,\nbased on ordinary experience, and supra-rational intuition, based on\nextra-ordinary religious experience, Nishida had purportedly committed\na methodological transgression. Here Tanabe poses a question that\nstill resounds through (some would say haunts) the halls of Kyoto\nSchool studies to this day. As James Heisig puts it, the Kyoto School\nthinkers in general do not share an important assumption of Western\nphilosophy as a whole, namely, a “clear delineation between\nphilosophy and religion” (Heisig 2001, 13–14). This is a\ncomplex issue, since the Western concept of “religion” was\njust as much an import to Japan as was “philosophy.” The\nproblems faced and the possibilities opened up by a Zen Buddhist\n“philosophy of religion” in particular differ in\nsignificant ways from a Judeo-Christian one, insofar as the former\ncalls for extending rational thought in the direction of a\n“practice of awakening” rather than in the direction of a\nleap of faith. \nI have addressed the provocative methodological ambivalences involved\nin Nishida’s and Nishitani’s philosophies of Zen in detail elsewhere\n(Davis 2004b). Let it suffice to point out here that Tanabe too later\ncrisscrosses the line between philosophy and religion as much as any\nKyoto School thinker, although his Shin Buddhist inclinations took him\nin the direction of “faith” rather than\n “intuition.”[14]\n After this religious turn in his thinking, Tanabe claimed that\nphilosophy and faith must be mediated by a personal act of metanoesis\n(Tanabe 2000, 34; Tanabe 1986, 29) and that, in order to develop a\ngenuine philosophy of religion, “in the end one must have faith\nand become self-aware by means of religious faith” (Tanabe 2003,\n27). \nFor his part, Nishida responded to Tanabe’s early critique by\naffirming that his idea of the self-awareness of absolute nothingness\ndoes indeed entail the profound significance of religious experience.\nYet he claims that this is neither mystical in the sense of\n“religious ecstasy” nor “is it thought in the\ndirection of substance, as is Plotinus’ One.” He denied the\ncharge of emanationism, claiming that in his thought “it is not\na matter of the self-determination of being, but rather the\nself-determination of nothingness” (NKZ VI, 154). For Nishida,\nonly if the absolute is thought in terms of a self-negating\nnothingness, rather than in terms of a transcendent plenum of the One,\nis it possible to truly affirm the world of the many. The absolute is\nfound in the very midst of beings, not beyond them. It is\n“because this is absolute nothingness,” Nishida writes in\nthe parlance of Zen, “that the mountain is mountain, the river\nis river, and all beings are just as they are” (NKZ V, 182; see\nNishida 1958, 137). \nBut the other major concern of Tanabe’s critique of Nishida was that,\ninsofar as absolute nothingness is made into an unchanging basis or\nenveloping “place” of a system of reality, and insofar as\nit is seen as transcending the dialectical interactions among beings,\nthen such a philosophy ends up falling back into a metaphysics of\nbeing after all. In order to radically think the idea of absolute\nnothingness, Tanabe argues, we must conceive of it rather in terms of\n“absolute mediation” or “absolute dialectic.”\nabsolute nothingness must be thought, not as an enveloping place, but\nas the very movement of “absolute negation,” a movement\nwhich originates in the self-negation of absolute nothingness itself.\nTanabe writes: “Since the absolute, as nothingness, must act as\nan absolute mediating force, it presupposes relative being as its\nmedium. In contrast with the doctrine of the creation of the world\nmaintained by the theist, or the theory of emanation propounded by the\npantheist, [for] historical thinking the absolute and the relative,\nnothingness and being, are interrelated each with the other as\nindispensable elements of absolute mediation” (Tanabe 2000, 27;\nTanabe 1986, 23). \nIn this later text, Philosophy as Metanoetics, written around\nthe same time as Nishida was elaborating his own kenotic idea of a\nself-negating absolute nothingness, Tanabe, in a putative critique of\nNishida, also writes: “Because the absolute subject of\nOther-power is absolute nothingness … it must be thoroughly\nmediated by the relative self. In contrast to a mere\n‘self-identity of absolute contradictories’, only that\nwhich entails the absolute existential mediation of the death and\nresurrection of the self can be called absolute nothingness”\n(Tanabe 2000, 13; Tanabe 1986, 8). Tanabe’s passing dismissal of\nNishida’s terminology here is hardly convincing, since in fact Nishida\ntoo speaks of the absolute self-negation of absolute nothingness and\nof the existential death and resurrection of the finite self. In any\ncase, Tanabe’s philosophy as the “way of metanoetics”\n(zangedō) entails a ceaseless movement of what he calls\n“absolute critique,” where the self-power of finite reason\nagain and again runs up against antinomies, and is reborn only by way\nof absolute nothingness as what he calls, in the parlance of Shinran’s\nShin Buddhism, the workings of Other-power (tariki). \nAs Nishitani and others have pointed out (see NKC IX, 212ff.;\nNishitani 1991, 161ff.), Tanabe’s criticisms often fail to do justice\nto Nishida’s thought, and we should not forget the impetuses Tanabe\nacknowledges having received from his erstwhile mentor. Yet, on the\nother hand, his criticisms were not without their point, and his\nprovocations certainly did serve as counter-impetuses that spurred\nNishida on, not just to clarify, but also to further develop his\nphilosophy of absolute nothingness (see Sugimoto 2011; Kopf 2004). No\ndoubt in large part due to the persistent attention given by Tanabe to\nthe historical world, to the irrational element of the specific\nthrough which the individual and the universal must be mediated, and\nto the dialectical relations between finite beings, Nishida gradually\nmoved toward a much more dynamic conception of absolute nothingness as\nthe self-determination of the dialectical world, a self-determination\nwhich takes place only by way of the mutual interactions between\nindividual persons and things. \nIn the tradition of the Kyoto School, Tanabe’s role has often been\nseen, justly or unjustly, as more of a dialectical counterpoint than\nan independent alternative to Nishida. Following the lead of Nishida’s\nown creative appropriation of Tanabe’s critique of his middle-period\nphilosophy of place, subsequent Kyoto School figures have often tended\nto incorporate Tanabe’s dialectical thinking into, rather than seeing\nit as a replacement for, Nishida’s topological thinking of absolute\nnothingness. To be sure, such thinkers as Takeuchi Yoshinori and Hase\nShōtō were profoundly influenced by Tanabe who, inspired by\nShin Buddhism, understands absolute nothingness in terms of the\nabsolute mediation of Other-power. Yet many others, including\nNishitani, Ueda, Abe, and Ōhashi, received their primary impetus\nfrom Nishida who, inspired by Zen (as well as Shin) Buddhism, thinks\nin terms of a kenotic and dialectical self-determination of the place\nof absolute nothingness. \nTanabe’s method of thinking, as we have seen, was intensely\ndialectical, a method he developed through his prolonged study of\nHegel. Nishitani, on the other hand, began his study of Western\nthought by focusing on Bergson, Schelling, Nietzsche and the German\nmystics. Between 1937 and 1939 Nishitani studied with Heidegger, who\nwas at the time beginning to grapple with the question of nihilism,\nand whose phenomenology had developed into a thinking of the\n“clearing of being” or what he would later characterize as\na “topology of being” (Heidegger 1975, Vol. 15, 335).\nInfluenced no doubt in part by his contact with Heidegger (and perhaps\nin turn influencing Heidegger, who frequently invited him to his house\nto learn about Zen), Nishitani developed, in his own highly original\nmanner, existential and phenomenological aspects of Nishida’s topology\nof absolute nothingness. \nThe problem of nihilism gradually became the major focus of\nNishitani’s personal and scholarly attention. Nishitani understood the\nhistorical phenomenon of nihilism as a vacuous nothingness that\nassaults the modern world, a world bereft of its ethical and religious\nmoorings. Despite the profundity of his mentor Nishida’s philosophy,\nit failed to adequately address this crucial modern problem (see Ueda\n2011a). According to Nishitani, Nishida’s philosophy, whether it be\nhis early thought of “pure experience” or the later notion\nof “action-intuition,” begins already from a standpoint\nwhere the dualistic consciousness of the ego has already been broken\nthough (see NKC IX 247–48; Nishitani 1991, 184–85). For\nhis part, Nishitani was concerned with the question of how to think\nthe topological pathway leading to such a breakthrough to\nnon-duality. \nThe question of how to open up an existential path to the place of\nabsolute nothingness was particularly acute given the prevalence of\nthe pendulum swing between two extremes endemic to modernity: on the\none hand, an extreme reification of the subjective ego together with a\ncorresponding objectification and technological manipulation of\nthings; and, on the other hand, a reactive nihilism which threatens to\nnullify the very reality of both the self and things. For Nishitani,\nhumanism and science were incapable of overcoming this dilemma of\nreification vs. nullification; in fact, they had helped create it. In\nan age of secular egoism and nihilism, how could an experience of the\nplace of absolute nothingness take place? \nTo begin with, Nishitani says we must heed the call of Nietzsche’s\nmadman and cease fleeing from the experience of nihilism. God as the\nhighest being is dead, and it remains an open question whether he can\nbe reborn as absolute nothingness. In any case, the venture of\nNishitani’s philosophy of Zen is more concerned with the existential\nimperative of letting go of attachments than it is with immediately\ngrasping hold of a new concept for God. In order to finally free\nhumans from their egoistic obsessions and manipulative\nobjectifications in the dualistic “field of being and\nconsciousness,” Nishitani argued for the necessity of first\nboldly stepping back into the “field of nihility.” \nYet the real breakthrough to a non-dualistic reaffirmation of self and\nworld only occurs when the relative nothingness of nihility is in turn\nbroken through to a genuine experience of absolute nothingness or true\nemptiness on the “field of\nśūnyatā.” Nishitani thus explained the\npersonal encounter with nihilism as an experience of the extreme\nrelative nothingness of “nihility” or “vacuous\nnothingness” (kyomu), and for him the central task of\n“overcoming nihilism by way of passing through nihilism”\nentailed transgressing beneath (i.e., “trans-descending”)\nthe “field of nihility” to the “field of\nśūnyatā” (see NKC X, 109 and 122ff.;\nNishitani 1986, 97 and\n 108ff.).[15]\n As mentioned earlier (subsection 3.2), the “field of\nśūnyatā” is not a vacuum of relative\nnothingness that assaults beings from without; it is an open clearing\nwherein beings are neither nullified nor reified but rather let be in\nthe mutual freedom of their coming to be and passing away. It is also\nthe place in which a genuine interpersonal encounter can take place\n(Nishitani 2004; Davis 2017). \nWhile Nishitani’s “field of\nśūnyatā” (kū no\nba) corresponds in many respects to what Nishida calls the\n“place of absolute nothingness” (zettai-mu no\nbasho), Nishitani takes the peculiar problems that beset the\nmodern secular and technological world, as well as postmodern\ncritiques of metaphysics and subjectivity (especially those of\nNietzsche and Heidegger), far more seriously than did Nishida.\nNishitani also connects his thought much more explicitly with the\ntradition of Mahāyāna Buddhism than did Nishida, writing on,\nand writing from, what he calls the “standpoint of Zen”\n(see NKC XI; and Nishitani 2009). \nUeda Shizuteru—a student of Nishitani’s who has since the 1980s\nbeen at the center of the revival of Nishida studies—also takes\na topological, phenomenological, and existential approach to the idea\nof absolute nothingness; and he also explicitly orients himself to and\nfrom the standpoint of Zen (Ueda 2011c). Following in the tradition of\nthe Kyoto School’s dialogue with Western philosophers, in one of his\ninfluential works Ueda engages the work of Husserl, Heidegger and\nother phenomenologists to articulate a religiously charged philosophy\nof what he calls “twofold being-in-the-world”\n(nijūsekainaisonzai) (USS IX; see also Döll\n2010). \nWhile the first layer in which the self is located is the historical\nhorizon of the everyday life-world, this horizon itself is ultimately\nfound to rest in an absolutely “empty-expanse,” a place of\nabsolute nothingness that both enfolds the everyday world as well as\ngrounds the radical freedom of the individual “self-negating\nself” (see USS IX, 22–24 and 324ff.). Ueda finds this idea\nof returning, by way of absolute self-negation, to a primordial\nwellspring of existence that is “empty and free”\n(ledig und frei) in Meister Eckhart, and, in an even more\nrarified form, in Zen Buddhism (see Davis 2008a). It is from the\nlatter that he borrows the term “empty-expanse”\n(kokū) as a topological expression for\nśūnyatā. \nFor Ueda, then, the two-layered-world is inhabited by a\ntwo-layered-self, or, more precisely, by a “self that is not a\nself.” The self, as being-in-the-world, ultimately realizes\nitself in a moment of absolute self-negation where it dies to itself\nand stands as a “non-ego” or “hollow-being” in\nthe “hollow-expanse” which envelopes the horizonal\nlife-world. The true self, as a self that becomes itself by passing\nthrough the absolute negation of its ego, is a two-layered\nbeing-in-and-beyond-the-world; it stands in the horizon of the world\nwhich, in turn, rests in the empty-expanse of absolute\nnothingness. \nThis hollow-expanse is, to be sure, beyond conceptual understanding,\ninsofar as concepts have as their medium the world of language and its\ndeterminations of meaning. Nevertheless, what lies beyond the reach of\nlanguage is not to be understood as an ineffable mystical realm to\nwhich one ascends and remains, but rather is to be experienced in\nextreme moments from the limits of language as that which at once\ntears through and mends, exceeds and encompasses, transcends and\ntransforms our linguistic horizons of intelligibility. Insofar as we\ndo not close in on ourselves and rigidify our linguistic delimitations\nof the world, we can open ourselves up to the silence of this\nsurrounding expanse of unlimited openness, which in turn allows us to\nspeak and act more freely and responsibly in the world of linguistic\nsignificance (see Ueda 2011b; Davis 2019a). \nUeda argues that both the ego of the Cartesian cogito, as\nwell as the non-ego (Sanskrit: anātman; Japanese:\nmuga) of Buddhism, must ultimately be comprehended on the\nbasis of an understanding of the self as a repeated movement\nthrough a radical self-negation to a genuine self-affirmation. Ueda’s\nformula for this movement is: “I, not being I, am I.” Even\nwhen one says “I am I,” if we listen closely there is a\npause, a breath, between the first and the second “I.”\nPrecisely that opening—which necessarily occurs as a moment in\nthe ceaseless movement by which the identity of the self is\nconstituted—is the “ecstatic space” wherein an open\nencounter with another person is possible. \nSuch a genuine encounter with another person no longer takes place\nsimply within my, or your, or even our world-horizon. Ueda uses the\ngreeting of the bow as a concrete example to illustrate how mutual\nself-negation—the emptying of all ego-centered presumptions and\nagendas—returns us to a communal place where we, paradoxically,\nshare “nothing” in common. “There, by way of making\noneself into a nothingness, one returns into the infinite depths of\nthat ‘between’ where there is neither an I nor a you.\n… Then, when we rise again so as to come back to life anew and\nface one another, this becomes a matter of, as Dōgen puts it:\nthus am I; thus are you” (Ueda 1991, 67; see USS X, 107ff.).\nOpen to others, and to the hollow-expanse in which together we dwell,\nI am I (USS X, 23–24). \nNishitani had earlier used the expression, “the self that is not\na self,” to characterize the shared endeavor of Nishida and\nTanabe to think “a ‘self that is not a self’ turning\non the axis of absolute nothingness” (NKC IX, 238; Nishitani\n1991, 175). The idea of the true self as a “self that is not a\nself” expresses an essential aspect of what Nishida and other\nKyoto School thinkers call—following D. T. Suzuki, who in turn\ngleaned the idea from the Diamond Sutra—the\n“logic of soku-hi,” a logic of “is and is\nnot” or affirmation by way of negation (see Akizuki 1996,\n109–152; NKZ XI, 398–99; Nishida 1987, 70). The self finds\nits most originary freedom, and its most open engagement with others,\nthrough a radical self-negation which returns it, not to a higher Will\nor encompassing Being, but to an essentially self-negating absolute\nnothingness that, in turn, finds expression only in the interaction of\ntruly self-determining individuals. For Nishida, the true individual\nis an interpersonal self-determining focal point of the\nself-determination of absolute nothingness, in other words, an\ninteractive and creative element of a creative world (see NKZ VIII,\n343ff.). \nNishitani’s first book, The Philosophy of Radical\nSubjectivity, sought a more originary conception of the human\nsubject than had been developed in modern Western philosophy. In\ngeneral, for Nishitani, modern “subjectivity” remains\nbound by a reifying attachment to things and ultimately to the ego.\nNishitani did recognized certain advances in the direction of a truly\n“radical subjectivity” in modern ideas such as that of\nindividual “autonomy.” For example, the Kantian idea of\nthe ethical “person,” which opens itself to a universal\nstandpoint by way of a negation of the self-will of the ego, suggested\nfor Nishitani a “kind of standpoint of\n‘non-ego’” (see NKC I, 60). However, the autonomy of\nthe Kantian ethical subject can also be seen as asserting a sublated\nform of self-will, namely in its will to form as well as to conform to\nthe universal. Nishitani finds profounder intimations of a truly\nradical subjectivity in both Meister Eckhart’s mystical theology and\nNietzsche’s radical atheism, which each in their own way go beyond, or\ndig beneath, attachments to and sublations of egoity. Ultimately\nNishitani returns to the language of Zen Buddhism to express his\nconception of the “radical subjectivity of non-ego\n[muga]” as a “subjective nothingness”\n(shutai-teki mu) (NKC I, 88). \nThis radical subjective nothingness is not to be confused with the\nrelative nothingness of a “subjective consciousness” which\nsets itself over against, and objectifies, the world. As with Zen’s\nkōan of nothingness (mu), a realization of the\nradical subjectivity of non-ego (mu-ga) entails breaking\nthrough the dualistic barrier that artificially separates self and\nworld. For Nishitani, this breakthrough is expressed as “the\nself-awareness of the bottom dropping out” (NKC I, iii). It is a\nradical return, or “trans-descendence,” to “the\nbackground of our own selves,” to the Ungrund on which\nwe originally possess “not a single thing”\n(mu-ichi-motsu) (NKC XI, 243). \nWith Nishitani’s conception of a radical “subjective\nnothingness,” understood as a “standpoint of\nśūnyatā” realized on the “field of\nśūnyatā,” we find an explicit\nappropriation of both the psychological and the meontological (or\nmu-logical) paradigms of nothingness found in the traditions\nof East Asia. The notions of non-ego (muga) and\n“no-mind” or “mind of nothingness”\n(mushin) are thought in terms of the spontaneous openness of\nthe heart-mind that stands within the field of emptiness, an open\nplace which grants beings the free space needed for their unobstructed\n(muge) interactivity. \nAs we have seen, Nishida, Nishitani, and Ueda each conceived of\nabsolute nothingness in both an existential and a topological sense.\nAlthough Tanabe eschewed the topological conception of absolute\nnothingness, by understanding both the relative self and the absolute\nin terms of a ceaseless movement of affirmation by way of radical\nnegation, he too, in his own way, philosophically appropriated the\nEast Asian paradigms of psychological and meontological\nnothingness. \nIt should be clear by this point that the philosophical stakes\ninvolved in the Kyoto School’s thought are high—indeed they\ninvite us to rethink many of our most basic concepts and ways of\nexperiencing the world and ourselves. For this very reason Kyoto\nSchool thinkers promise to be especially valuable partners in any\npost-Eurocentric forum of philosophical dialogue. Genuine philosophy,\nafter all, thrives on the opportunity to call its fundamental\npresuppositions into question, even if stubbornly Eurocentric\nphilosophers fail to heed this crucial calling of their discipline.\nUnfortunately, the world of politics tends to be a far less\nself-critical and thus less genuinely dialogical forum of\nintercultural relations. The history of Western imperial domination of\nAsia is well documented (see Panikkar 1969), and post-colonial\ncritique of Western imperialism plays a prominent role in contemporary\nacademia. At the same time, in the field of East Asian studies, Kyoto\nSchool thinkers are frequently accused of contributing to the\npolitical ideology of Japanese imperialism in the 1930s and early\n1940s. However, we need to carefully examine the sense in which and\nthe extent to which the political thought of the Kyoto School is\ndeserving of its tainted reputation in this regard. \nThe political ventures and misadventures of philosophers—from\nSocrates and Plato to Marx and Heidegger in the West, and from\nConfucius and Hanfeizi to Gandhi and Nishida in the\nEast—represent an often enduring though hardly always endearing\naspect of their legacies. Relating the “ideal” world of\nphilosophy to the “real” world of political action is a\nperilous, if arguably obligatory, undertaking. \nThe pitfalls of political intervention are particularly deep when\nphilosophers find themselves in a nation headed down a road toward\ninjustice and disaster. What is a philosopher to do in such a\nsituation? Barring straightforward complicity, there appear to be\nthree choices: withdraw into reclusion, stand up in overt\nresistance, or attempt to negotiate a reorientation by means\nof immanent critique or cooperative correction.\nWhile many intellectuals in wartime Japan took the first course, some\ncourageous Leftists braved the second course. Both Tosaka Jun and Miki\nKiyoshi, the key figures of what is sometimes called the “left\nwing of the Kyoto School,” died in prison in 1945 as a result of\ntheir intellectual resistance. The majority of the Kyoto School\nthinkers, however, including Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani, took the\nthird course of action. \nIn retrospect Nishitani wrote: “My attempt was, on the one hand,\nto explain where Japan was situated within the world to those\nintellectuals remaining on the sidelines [of politics]; and, on the\nother hand, with respect to the extremely nationalistic thought that\nwas becoming increasingly prevalent at the time, I attempted from\nwithin to open up a path for overcoming this extreme\nnationalism” (NKC IV, 384). Rather than either stand up and die,\nor sit out and wait, Nishitani and other members of the Kyoto School\nattempted to walk the razor’s edge of what Ōhashi Ryōsuke\nhas called “anti-establishment cooperation” or\n“cooperative resistance” (hantaiseiteki\nkyōryoku) (see Ōhashi 2001, 20ff.). \nTo be sure, the question of how successfully the Kyoto School managed\nto carry out this “cooperative resistance” (and the\nquestion of whether they cooperated more than resisted, or vice versa)\nis debatable, especially given the fact that they hardly succeeded in\naltering the disastrous orientation of the regime. Their intentions of\ncooperative resistance notwithstanding, the fact is that their\npolitical writings were more or less successfully co-opted by the\nextreme nationalism that they were trying to reorient or overcome from\nwithin. Nevertheless, we must take care to separate their ideals from\nthe reality they were attempting to influence, and bear in mind the\nconstraints of their chosen path of immanent critique. \nWhatever the political failings of the Kyoto School thinkers may be,\nit is clear that certain crudely one-sided condemnations are at least\nas simplistic and misleading as are the occasional attempts of\noverzealous acolytes to whitewash everything they ever said or wrote.\nIt is, for example, highly misleading to refer to the Kyoto School’s\nphilosophy of history as “a thinly disguised justification\n… for Japanese aggression and continuing imperialism,” or\nto claim that “no group helped defend the state more\nconsistently and enthusiastically … and none came closer\n… to defining the philosophic contours of Japanese\nfascism” (Najita & Harootunian 1998, 238–39; for a severe\ncritique of such polemical claims, see Parkes 1997 and 2011). The\nlatter dishonor, namely that of attempting to give quasi-philosophical\nexpression to Japanese fascism, surely goes to the proponents of\n“Imperial Way Philosophy,” who in fact harshly attacked\nthe “world-historical philosophy” of the Kyoto School for\nbeing insufficiently Japan-centric (see Ōhashi 2001,\n71–72). \nJudicious critics of the wartime political writings of the Kyoto\nSchool must surely try to steer a middle course between and beyond\nwhat James Heisig aptly calls the “side-steppers and the\nside-swipers” (see Heisig 1990, 14). With this balance in mind,\nin the following sections let me highlight some of the key points and\nepisodes of the Kyoto School’s wartime political ventures and\nmisadventures. \nIn 1943 Yatsugi Kazuo, a member of the Center for National Strategy,\napproached Nishida and asked him to contribute a scholarly account of\nJapan’s role in East Asia, that is, to help provide a rationale for\nthe creation of the so-called “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity\nSphere.” Nishida is said to have burst out in anger, shouting\nsomething like: “What on earth do government officials and\nmilitarists think these days, that scholars are like artisans from\nwhom they can order something to be tailor made?” And yet\nYatsugi apparently countered to the effect that not only prominent\nJapanese scholars, such as Fukuzawa Yukichi, but also Western\nphilosophers, such as Kant and Adam Smith, did not neglect to apply\ntheir theoretical insights to practical social and political\ncircumstances (see Ōhashi 2001, 47). In the end Nishida did agree\nto write an essay, “Principles for a New World Order” (NKZ\nXII, 426–434; see Arisaka 1996), though his original text was\nedited and “simplified” by a sociologist serving as a\ngo-between. Nishida was even then disappointed that his attempt to\n“bring out the dimension of universality present in the Japanese\nspirit” seemed to have had no effect on Prime Minister\nTōjō Hideki and his bellicose regime (see Yusa 1994,\n124). \nFrom today’s vantage point, Nishida’s political writings appear highly\nambivalent. On the one hand, his resistance to fascism and\ntotalitarianism is unmistakable. Indeed it comes as no surprise that\nhe was in danger of being arrested—and apparently only his\npublic stature and the fact that he had influential sympathizers\nwithin the moderate ranks of the government kept this from\nhappening—when one reads the warning given in his 1941 speech\ndelivered directly to the emperor: “Any totalitarian system that\nnegates outright the role of the individual is but an\nanachronism” (NKZ XII, 271; see Yusa 1994, 111). Even in his\nmost compromised text, “Principles for a New World Order,”\nNishida urgently claims that the “co-prosperity sphere”\nmust not entail either ethnocentrism, expansionism,\nimperialism, colonialism, or totalitarianism (see NKZ XII,\n432–33). Elsewhere Nishida made clear that his vision was of a\nmulticultural world where neither the West would subsume the East nor\nvice versa (NKZ XIV, 404–5), where “various cultures,\nwhile maintaining their own individual standpoints, would develop\nthemselves through the mediation of the world” (NKZ VII,\n452–53). \nOn the other hand, Nishida did think that nations—and in\nparticular the Japanese nation with the emperor at its spiritual\ncenter—had a special role to play in the historical formation of\nthis truly “worldly world” (sekai-teki sekai).\nMoreover, in his writings he did affirmatively employ such problematic\nphrases as “all the world under one roof”\n(hakkō-ichiu) and the “imperial way”\n(kōdō). While there is certainly room for criticism\nhere in light (and hindsight) of the historical record of Japan’s\npolitical and cultural “leadership” (in fact, domination)\nof East Asia at this time, the issue of how to critically evaluate\nNishida’s theoretical interventions is complicated by the\nhermeneutical fact that today we read such catchwords and phrases\nthrough the semantic lenses of the right wing ideologues who in the\nend succeeded in carving their definitions into the annals of history.\nIt must be kept in mind that, at the time, the precise meaning of\nthese phrases was still in dispute. Ueda Shizuteru has aptly spoken of\nNishida’s “tug-of-war over meaning,” a struggle which he\nultimately lost (Ueda 1994, 97; also see Goto-Jones 2005). Yusa\nMichiko writes in this regard: “Rather than invent a new\nvocabulary that would rise above the fray, [Nishida] took up the\njargon and slogans of the day and sought to redeem them from their\npetty provincialism by opening them up to a more universal\nperspective” (Yusa 1994, 131). \nNevertheless, even after we have carried out a hermeneutically\nsensitive reconstruction of the context, and after we have finished\nreading between and behind the lines of his political texts, there\nundoubtedly remain a number of controversial aspects of Nishida’s\npolitical thought. Affirming the central place of the emperor in Japan\nas “an identity of contradictions,” Nishida cryptically\nwrites: “Our [i.e., Japan’s] national polity is not simply a\ntotalitarianism. The Imperial House is the beginning and the end of\nour world, as the absolute present that embraces past and\nfuture” (NKZ XII,\n 430).[16]\n And with regard to the central role of Japan in East Asia, he claims\nthat “in order to build a particular world, a central figure\nthat carries the burden of the project is necessary. In East Asia\ntoday there is no other but Japan” (NKZ XII, 429; Arisaka 1996,\n102). \nCritics may argue that Nishida’s universalism is still plagued by an\nexemplary\n particularism,[17]\n and that he succeeds in questioning Eurocentrism only by way of\nshifting the locus of the concrete universal to Japan. Yoko Arisaka\nargues that “the chief claim of the defenders—that\nNishida’s philosophical ‘universalism’ is incompatible\nwith nationalist ideology—fails because universalist discourse\nwas used both as a tool of liberation and oppression in Japan’s\ncase” (Arisaka 1999, 242). Arisaka critically adds, however,\nthat “the idea that a particular nation may be the bearer of a\nuniversal principle, such as freedom or democracy, and that,\ntherefore, its actions in history serve a higher end, should be\nfamiliar from recent American experience” (ibid., 244; also see\nMaraldo 1994, 355). \nTo be fair to Nishida, we should confess that we today have yet to\nsolve the post-Enlightenment aporia of how to reconcile universal\nhumanism with cultural particularity (a debate we inherit in part from\nthe Kant-Herder controversy). In other words, the question remains of\nhow to configure a multicultural world of dialogue instead of either\nan imperialistic monoculture or a clash of civilizations. In our\nsearch for an answer to this urgent question, we may still have much\nyet to learn from a critical appropriation of Nishida’s thought (see\nFeenberg 1995; Maraldo 1995; Kopf 2011; Davis 2013b; Elberfeld 1999;\nand Goto-Jones 2002, 2005, 2008, 2009). \nNishida’s ambivalent political stance—between a\npost-imperialistic vision of a multicultural new world order on the\none hand and an assertion of Japan’s destined world-historical role in\nrealizing this vision on the other—was carried forth into even\nmore controversial political engagements by his students Nishitani\nKeiji, Kōyama Iwao, Kōsaka Masaaki, Suzuki Shigetaka, and to\na lesser extent Shimomura Toratarō. As mentioned in subsection\n2.1, a significant, if stigmatizing, stage in the formation of the\nidentity of the Kyoto School involved the participation of several of\nits members in two wartime symposia, the Literary World’s\n1942 symposium on “Overcoming Modernity” (reprinted in\nKawakami & Takeuchi 1979; English translation in Calichman 2008) and the\n1941–43 roundtable discussions published serially in the journal\nChūōkōron and later as a monograph, The\nStandpoint of World History and Japan (Kōsaka et al 1943;\nEnglish translation in Williams 2014). \nThe Overcoming Modernity symposium has been aptly\ncharacterized as “a premature challenge to the questions that\nhave yet to be answered today” (Minamoto 1994, 200). Even one of\nthe most critical accounts of this symposium—an account which\nargues that the “only destination reached by the symposium on\novercoming modernity was the place where Japan itself had been\novercome by modernity”—concedes that: “It is,\nnevertheless, important to point out that the very critique mounted by\nJapanese against modernity prefigured precisely all of those doubts\nand obsessions concerning subjectivity, cultural difference, and even\nracism that have become the signatures of a Western and putatively\nglobal discourse that marks our own historical conjuncture\ntoday” (Harootunian 2000, 94). \nAs discussed in subsection 2.2, the Kyoto School participants spoke of\nan overcoming of modernity that can take place only by way of passing\nthrough modernity, a stance that represented a\ncountertendency to the rejection of modern Western rationality by the\nJapanese Romantic School and other participants in the symposium. In\nother words, the Kyoto School participants did not lament the\nmodernization/Westernization of Japan, nor did they nostalgically plea\nfor a return to a pre-modern age; rather, they called for a further\nstep forward, but one that would involve creatively recovering viable\nelements of Japanese tradition at the same time as building on the\nbest of what could be learned from the West. This stance shows up\nclearly in Nishitani’s debate with Kobayashi Hideo, who argued for a\nrejection of modernity and a return to the pre-modern Japanese\nclassics (see Kawakami & Takeuchi 1979, 217ff.). Throughout his career\nNishitani consistently spoke of overcoming modernity only by way of\npassing through it, and in this process tradition was to be creatively\nappropriated, not conservatively retreated to. He wrote: “There\nis no turning back to the way things were. … Our tradition must\nbe appropriated from the direction in which we are heading, as a new\npossibility” (NKC VIII, 183; Nishitani 1990, 179); and:\n“Simply put, the backward looking return to tradition is\nstraightaway to be forward looking” (NKC XIX, 104). Later in\nlife Nishitani continued to stress that Japanese Buddhist\norganizations need to embrace their historcality, which means to\nmodernize and then postmodernize; only in this way can they continue\nto play a vital role in Japanese society as well as offer the\npossibilities of their ways of life to the wider world (Nishitani\n2006, 36–38). \nIn the Chūōkōron discussions as well the Kyoto\nSchool resolutely attempted to think from the “standpoint of\nworld history.” Problematically, however, they asserted a\nleadership role for Japan in the present moment, which they viewed as\na turning point in world history. If the standpoint of world history\nhad indeed been first opened up by both Western universalism\nand imperialism, they argued, it was the non-Western nation\nof Japan that was in a unique position to free the world from the\nchains of the latter in order to realize the true potential of the\nformer. \nIn his book written around the same time, View of the World and\nthe Nation, Nishitani went so far as to claim that this was the\nmoment in time when the “focal point of world history” was\nto become the Japanese nation, just as previously world history had\ncentered on the Roman Empire and then later on the British Empire.\nHowever, Nishitani argued, unlike the former two empires Japan’s\nhistorical mission was to bring about a world that has “no\nspecific center” but rather consists of various\n“politically and culturally unified spheres” (NKC IV,\n298–300). The Japanese nation would be able to carry out this\nmission, he crucially adds, only if it incorporates a religious spirit\nof self-negation, thus becoming what he calls a “nation of\nnon-ego” rather than a self-centered aggressive empire (NKC IV,\n285–86). In this idealistic vision, which unfortunately had\nlittle to do with the cruel realities of Japanese expansionism, Japan\nwas to be an altogether new kind of empire, a self-negating and\ncompassionate one that would help other nations to cooperatively form\ntheir own identities, rather than an aggressive and\n“imperialistic” one that would remold others into inferior\nreplicas of itself. (It remains for us to ask how best to characterize\ntoday’s political superpowers and economic empires, and how to relate\ntheir ideologies to their realities.) \nIf there is a lasting merit to Nishitani’s wartime political writings\nand the Chūōkōron discussions, it might be\nfound in part in their critique of the contradictions and hypocrisies\nof Western imperialism (see, for example, Kōsaka et al. 1943,\n348ff.), together with their insistence that Japan’s “leading\nrole” in Asia not become that of an imperialist or colonizer\n(see ibid., 204–5; also see Nishitani’s “My View of\n‘Overcoming Modernity’,” reprinted in\nKawakami & Takeuchi 1979, 32). The lasting infamy of the\nChūōkōron discussions, on the other hand, can\nbe found not only in their idealistic political naïveté,\nbut also in their idealization and even whitewashing of political\nrealities (such as Japanese aggression in China and other parts of\nAsia), as well as in such disturbing specific suggestions as that of\n“Japanizing” or “half-Japanizing” some of the\n“more superior” ethnic groups in Asia in order to assist\nin instituting the Japanese led “Co-Prosperity Sphere”\n(Kōsaka et al. 1943, 262–63, 337). \nIt is now evident that the political activities of the Kyoto School\nduring the war were even more involved—and even more filled with\nambiguity—than was previously thought. Ōhashi Ryōsuke\ndiscovered and published in 2001 some wartime notebooks of Ōshima\nYasuma, a student of Tanabe’s (Ōhashi 2001). These notebooks\ndocument in detail secret meetings regularly held by Kyoto School\nmembers at the bequest of the Japanese navy between February 1942 and\njust before the end of the war. While on the one hand the existence of\nthese secret meetings demonstrates an even more intimate connection\nbetween the Kyoto School and the military than was previously known,\non the other hand it is crucially significant that they were in\ncooperation with a certain moderate faction of the navy, a faction\nthat was opposed to the extremists that dominated the army. There had\nlong existed a considerable tension between the bellicose arrogance of\nthe army and the comparatively more moderate and worldly stance of the\nnavy. As the politically more powerful army was setting a war-bound\ncourse for Pearl Harbor, some reticent navy officials evidently\npetitioned the Kyoto School to shed light on the political situation\nfrom their “world-historical standpoint,” presumably in\norder to sway public sentiment in a more prudent direction. \nIn short, the “Ōshima Memos” help reveal how the\nKyoto School found themselves in a position where they were called on\nto fight a “war of thought” on two fronts: against Western\nimperialism, they felt called on to delineate a world-historical role\nfor Japan in freeing itself and other Asian peoples from colonization\nand exploitation by the Western empires; and, against Japanese\nultra-nationalism, they felt that it was up to them to convince the\npublic and the military of the illegitimacy of an imperialistic\nresponse to Western imperialism. \nŌshima Yasuma had himself published, in 1965, an often overlooked\naccount of these meetings under the title, “The Pacific War and\nthe Kyoto School: On the Political Participation of\nIntellectuals” (Ōshima 2000, 274–304; also see Horio\n1994, 301ff.). In this article, Ōshima summarized the evolving\npurpose of the secret Kyoto School meetings in three stages: In the\nvery first meetings (which apparently took place prior to those\ndocumented in the recovered notebooks), the main theme was “how\nto avoid the outbreak of war.” Since war in fact broke out very\nsoon thereafter, the theme quickly switched to “how to bring the\nwar to a favorable end as soon as possible, by way of rationally\npersuading the army.” To do this they reportedly agreed that it\nwould be necessary to overthrow the cabinet of Tōjō Hideki.\nHowever, according to Ōshima, all criticism of Tōjō and\nthe army had to be expurgated in the discussions published in the\npages of Chūōkōron, and the statements of the\nKyoto School had to be “veiled in two or three layers of\ncloth” in order to avoid censorship and persecution. Towards the\nend of the war, the theme of the secret meetings is said to have\nchanged to that of “how to handle the postwar\nsituation.” \nAmong these three themes only the second is recorded in any detail in\nthe notebooks that were recently discovered and published by\nŌhashi as the “Ōshima Memos.” Although there may\nwell have been preliminary discussions on how to avoid war, more\nexplicit references to overthrowing Tōjō Hideki, and more\nlengthy discussions about postwar issues, these do not in fact show up\nin the recovered notebooks. Nevertheless, the “Ōshima\nMemos” do show us a more detailed and uncensored account of the\nKyoto School’s “war of thought” on two fronts during a\ntumultuous and tragic time of what was, in fact, Japan’s imperialistic\nresponse to Western imperialism. \nTheir ambivalent wartime stance between supporting the nationalistic\nideology and subjecting it to critique from a pluralistic and global perspective—in other words, their attempt to walk a razor’s edge of\n“cooperative resistance”—ironically earned the Kyoto\nSchool a suspect reputation in Japan both before and\nafter the end of the war. As Nishitani confided later to a\nstudent: “During the war we were struck on the cheek from the\nright; after the war we were struck on the cheek from the\nleft.” \nDuring the war, the stance of the Kyoto School was considered too\ncosmopolitan and insufficiently nationalistic, even anti-war. The\ndiscussions published in The Standpoint of World History and\nJapan were branded by the Imperial Way ideologues as\n“ivory-tower speculations that risked reducing the Empire to\nsimply one more category of world history,” and further\nprintings of the book were reportedly stopped by the government\ncensors (see Horio 1994, 291). After the war, the Kyoto School’s\nidealistic attempts to impart meaning and direction to Japan’s\n“world historical mission” were seen—especially by\nliberals and leftists that had at long last been freed from repression\nand persecution—as support for its de facto\nmilitaristic fascism. Nishitani and others were purged for several\nyears from their university positions. Even when they were later\nreinstated, the stigma of the Kyoto School as having “cooperated\nin the war” was hardly erased. Their political thought in\nparticular was dismissed in toto, and it was not until\ndecades later that the topic of “overcoming modernity” was\nonce again given serious critical attention (see Kawakami &\nTakeuchi 1979; Hiromatsu 1989; and Ōhashi 1992, 143ff.). \nThe Kyoto School thinkers rarely responded directly to their critics\nafter the war, and we can only speculate on the reasons for this (see\nHorio 1994, 300). They accepted suspension from their posts without\ncomment or complaint, and continued on with their philosophizing,\nalbeit without the overtly political element of their thought.\nNishitani, for example, came into his own as a philosopher of religion\nin the postwar era. He continued to philosophically develop Eastern\nideas, those of Zen Buddhism in particular, in dialogue with medieval\nChristian mysticism as well as postmodern existentialism and\nphenomenology and in response to what he saw as the central problem of\nmodernity, namely, nihilism. In his mature attempts to “overcome\nnihilism by way of passing through nihilism” (NKC XX, 192), we\nfind a significant thread of continuity with his pre-war and wartime\nattempts to overcome (Western) modernity by way of passing through it.\nBut it is nevertheless possible to mark a crucial and self-critical\n“turn” in his thinking with regard to the question of the\npolitical role—or, as it turns out, the lack of one—to be\nplayed by the Japanese state in this overcoming of modernity and\nnihilism by way of passing through them (see Davis 2008b). \nTanabe got a head start on the postwar critics and toward the end of\nthe war began thinking his way through a radical crisis of\nself-critique. Hardly less controversial than the roundtable\ndiscussions of the younger members of the Kyoto School have been\nTanabe’s application—or misapplication—of his “logic\nof the specific” to a discourse on the legitimacy of the\nself-assertion of the Japanese nation-state as an archetype for\nothers. The “logic of the specific” had originally been\nconceived, in critique of Bergson and Nishida, as a reappraisal of the\nlogical and ethical role that ethnic specificity plays in mediating\nthe particular individual and universal humanity. Adapting Hegel’s\npolitical philosophy, Tanabe thought that the nation-state could both\nembody the ethnic specificity of the people and raise it out of its\ninherent irrationality. As a concrete universal, the nation-state was,\nif not the absolute itself, in some sense the dialectical\nmanifestation of the absolute on earth. \nThe critical lapse came when Tanabe irrationally proposed that the\n“relative absolute” of the Japanese nation-state could\nserve as a kind of “supreme archetype” for other nations\n(see THZ VI, 232–33). James Heisig writes that, in so doing,\nTanabe “took a step that was fatal but really unnecessary, if\nnot outright inconsistent with the principles of his logic….\nAccording to his own logic, the community of the human race is to be\nmade up of a community of nations that have found a way to transcend\ntheir specificity without transcending time and culture. Each nation\nmay come about as an instance of the generic universal, but nothing in\nthe logic of the specific allows any one instance to become an\narchetype for the others. It is as if Tanabe were quoting himself out\nof context” (Heisig 2001, 136–37; also see Heisig\n1994). \nTanabe finally came to his senses and, in a striking metanoetic turn,\nrenounced these political assertions and dove into the philosophy of\nreligion. Philosophy as Metanoetics, the first parts of which\nwere delivered as lectures in 1944 before the end of the war, was\ncomposed not only as a personal self-critique, but also as a call to\nself-critique on the part of the entire nation, and indeed ultimately\nas a call for an “absolute critique” of human rationality\nas such (see the Preface to THZ X; Tanabe 1986). It is the last of\nthese that is the central theme of the book: the idea that the human\nreason is inevitably driven to antinomies through which it must\nrepeatedly die to its own self-power in order to be reborn again\nthrough the workings of an Other-power. It is nevertheless true that\n“one looks through that work in vain for any admission of guilt\nfor particular actions or statements that he had made” (Heisig\n2001, 151). In any case, Tanabe’s public (if vague) repentance was no\nmore successful than the silence of other Kyoto School thinkers in\nconvincing the majority of postwar Japanese academics to refrain from\nthrowing the baby of their philosophical insights out with the\nbathwater of their political misadventures. \nOnly in the past few decades has the reputation of the Kyoto School\nbeen significantly rehabilitated in Japan, due in part to a general\nrecovery of the nation from immersion in the march of postwar economic\nprogress and evasion of unresolved cultural aporias, in part to a\ngeneral reaffirmation of cultural identity (including all too often a\npendulum swing back to ethnocentric reassertions of “Japanese\nuniqueness”), and in part to the positive attention the School\nhas received from Western scholars. It is worthwhile noting, as Fujita\nMasakatsu does in his preface to The Philosophy of the Kyoto\nSchool, that prior to 2001 surprisingly few articles or books had\nappeared in Japan with a thematic focus on the “Kyoto\nSchool” as such, even though hundreds of studies had treated\n“Nishida Philosophy.” Yet there are promising signs that\nwe are standing on the brink of a new academic era in which critical\nyet appreciative work on the Kyoto School can be cooperatively\nundertaken in Japan, in the West, and recently even in other parts of\nEast Asia (see Fujita et al. 2003; Heisig 2004; Synthesis\nPhilosophica 2004; Fujita & Davis 2005; Hori & Curley\n2008; Heisig & Uehara 2008; Lam & Cheung 2009; Bouso &\nHeisig 2009; Davis, Schroeder, & Wirth 2011; Elberfeld &\nArisaka 2014; Yusa 2017; Davis 2019b). \nDespite the persistence of a faction of polemical intellectual\nhistorians, perhaps we are reaching a point where philosophers\nworldwide are beginning to see the political misadventures of the\nKyoto School as questionable footnotes to their central philosophical\nendeavors, rather than the other way around. While research into their\npolitical thought—regarding what it tried to say then and\nregarding what it can or cannot help us to think now—remains\nnecessary and important, at the end of the day many are likely to\nagree with James Heisig when he emphatically writes: “One\nhas … to ignore the greatest bulk of the writings of these\nthinkers to arrive at the conclusion that anything approaching or\nsupporting the imperialistic ideology of wartime Japan belongs to the\nfundamental inspiration of their thought” (Heisig 2001, 6).\nThe philosophical and cross-cultural legacy of the Kyoto School lies\nelsewhere. \nIn this concluding section, let us return to the question of the\nlegacy of the Kyoto School with regard to comparative or\ncross-cultural philosophy. As mentioned at the outset, the Kyoto\nSchool thinkers were all dedicated scholars of various fields and\nfigures of Western philosophy; and yet, at the same time they kept one\nfoot firmly in touch with their native East Asian traditions, those of\nMahāyāna Buddhism in particular. This bipedal stance placed\nthem in an extraordinary position “between East and\nWest.” \nHowever, their philosophies do not simply drift impartially on the\nseas of academic comparison, nor do they see themselves primarily as\nmediators of inter-religious dialogue. As existentially engaged\nphilosophers, they are above all seekers after truth, and they argue\npassionately for the validity of seeing the self and the world in\ncertain ways. As we have seen, while each member of the Kyoto School\nhas his own vision of the truth, they share certain fundamental ideas,\nsuch as one or another version of the core notion of absolute\nnothingness and the idea of coming to a genuine self-awareness by way\nof emptying the ego. And however much their texts reflect an intimate\ndialogue with and critical appropriation of ideas from Western\nphilosophers, it can be said that many of their main theses\nnevertheless reflect a distinctly Eastern influence. \nNevertheless, this does not mean that they merely gave modern\nexpression to traditional East Asian Buddhist thought. It would be\nmore accurate to say that their philosophies are critical and\ncreative developments of that tradition. But even this way of\nputting it would not do justice to the influence exerted on their\nthought by the Western philosophies with which they grappled so\nintensely. Although Hisamatsu, Nishitani, Ueda and others do\nexplicitly philosophize from the standpoint of Zen, and although\nTakeuchi, Hase, and others do so from the standpoint of Shin Buddhism,\nit would be misleading to simply and without qualification\ncharacterize either Nishida’s or Tanabe’s multifaceted philosophies as\n“Eastern” or “Buddhist.” \nFor example, Tanabe’s early “logic of the specific,” with\nits concern for the manner in which ethnic specificities mediate\nparticular individuals and universal humanity, can be read more as a\ncritical appropriation of Hegelian dialectical logic and political\nphilosophy than as any straightforward development of East Asian or\nBuddhist thought. And in his various later writings on the philosophy\nof religion, Tanabe wanders between a preference for Shin Buddhism,\nChristianity, and finally Zen Buddhism (see Himi 1990, 129–341).\nWith regard to Nishida, an acute concern with questions of\nepistemology, logic, individual autonomy, creativity, and the\nhistoricity of the world are essential to his thought in ways that are\nmore “modern Western” than “traditional\nEastern”; and Nishida at times explicitly indicates his\ndissatisfaction with what he sees as related weaknesses in traditional\nEastern thought. \nOf course, one might respond: even if Nishida methodologically takes\nhis questions from Western philosophy, his responses to these\nquestions reflect his East Asian roots at least as much as his Western\nstudies. To the Western ontological question of being, his answer is a\nmeontology of absolute nothingness. And even if his systematic\nphilosophical articulations of the idea of absolute nothingness owe\nmore to Western than Eastern texts, he nevertheless understands\nhimself to have autonomously (i.e., in the process of engaging in a\nnonsectarian philosophical search for truth) given expression to the\nformless origin that is harbored in the traditions of the East. In\nretrospect Nishida wrote: “It is not that I conceived of my way\nof thinking in dependence on Mahāyāna Buddhism; and yet it\nhas come into accord with it” (NKZ XIV, 408). Nishitani could\nhave said something similar of his career path through the study of\nWestern philosophy and mysticism and “back” to the\nstandpoint of Zen. Other Kyoto School thinkers took even less of an\nOccidental excursion before making what Hölderlin called a\n“homecoming though the foreign.” And some, like Hisamatsu\nand Takeuchi, began their scholarly pursuits with a self-understanding\nas a Zen or Shin Buddhist thinker. \nWhat is perhaps most controversial, from a cross-cultural political\npoint of view, is Nishida’s and other Kyoto School thinkers’\nsuggestion that it is modern Japanese culture and philosophy in\nparticular that has the potential to be developed so as to make room\nfor the cooperative meeting of the strengths of East and West (see NKZ\nXIV, 416–17; also Nishida 1964, 365). What are we to make of\nsuch bold claims? There appear to be two problematical assertions\ninvolved: first, an overly generalized, if not at times hypostatized,\nsplit of cultural spheres into “East” and\n“West”; and second, a claim that an idea with deeper roots\nin the East, namely absolute nothingness, can be developed so as to\nprovide the philosophical meeting place of both East and\n West.[18] \nEven sympathetic readers of the Kyoto School are often highly critical\nof this type of comparative thinking in terms of “East”\nand “West.” Although he affirms that “the\nKyoto-school philosophers give the west a way into the east like none\nother,” James Heisig complains that “the East” which\nthe Kyoto School sets up over against “the West” is\nsomething of an invention: “At best, it is one constellation of\na heritage too long and too plural to be represented fairly by\nJapan” (Heisig 2001, 271–72). John Maraldo goes further\nand claims that “the problems Nishida deals with are universal,\nand his way of dealing with them contrasts as much with other Asian\nphilosophers as with philosophers of the so-called West”\n(Maraldo 1995, 196). Is it necessary and are we ready to do as Maraldo\nsuggests, and “put ‘East’ and ‘West’ to\nrest”? \nI myself am somewhat ambivalent regarding this complex issue. While I\ncertainly agree with the wish to avoid overgeneralizations and\npolitically charged polarizations, and while I think the writings of\nthe Kyoto School do need to be read critically in this regard, I am\nequally wary of a “globalization of thought” that amounts\nto a colonization of “non-Western” traditions by\n“Western” methods and categories of thinking. I also\ncontinue to believe that the threads of the\nGreco-Roman-Judeo-Christian-Euro-American traditions and cultures are\nwoven tightly enough together to warrant provisionally\nand in certain contexts speaking of “the West.”\nIt is true that “the East” is a more problematic concept\nsince it is a less tightly woven set of traditions and cultures,\nespecially from the perspective of India (which, of course, did not\nappropriate any Chinese tradition the way China appropriated\nBuddhism). From Japan’s perspective, however, especially from a\nJapanese Buddhist perspective which intimately weaves together\nIndo-Sino-Japanese threads, it may still make some sense\nprovisionally and in certain contexts to speak in\nterms of “the East.” \nAs Thomas Kasulis reminds us (Kasulis 2018, 36 and 41),\ngeneralizations are not universalizations; by definition there are\nexceptions to any general definition of something. The bigger the\ngeneralization, the more exceptions will it have. Nevertheless, we\ncannot think without generalities, and it is no doubt a matter of\n“practical wisdom” (phronesis) to know when to\nconstruct and when to deconstruct them. Thus, even though we must be\ncareful to discern the appropriate contexts in which it makes sense to\nspeak in such vast and abstract terms, it is no more advisable to\nunequivocally annihilate the concepts of “West” and\n“East” than it is to narrowly define or absolutize their\nrespective coherences and mutual differences. \nWith regard to the hermeneutics of modern cross-cultural thinking, in\ngeneral I believe that the attempt to obliterate the borders that\nseparate cultural spheres is as pernicious as is the attempt to\nhermetically seal them up. Of course, this goes for intra- as well as\ninter-traditional differences. Needless to say, defining, comparing,\ncontrasting, and above all evaluating the relative worth of various\ntraditions, remain undertakings fraught with theoretical, ethical and\npolitical pitfalls. The theoretical and cultural legacies of\ncolonialism and Orientalism remain with us long after the political\nEmpires have receded. Moreover, in these postcolonial times we all too\noften experience reactive fabrications of homogeneous cultural\nidentity and assertions of counter-superiority, reactions which\nironically reinforce the same kind of colonial divisions and\nobsessions with unadulterated self-identity that were in part imposed\nby, or imported from, the worst of the West. \nIn Japan, certain retroactive constructions of identity and reactive\ncounter-assertions of superiority have taken the form of what is\ncalled nihonjin-ron: theories of “Japaneseness”\nor “Japanese uniqueness” (see Dale 1986). In modern\nJapanese history, such reactive cultural self-obsession and\nself-assertion has taken either the form of denying Japan’s\ndeep-rooted traditional connections with its East Asian neighbors, or\nthe form of claiming that Japan has uniquely embodied and perfected\n“the essence of the East.” If the former type of claim is\nmost in evidence in postwar and contemporary Japan, the latter is\nfound, for example, in the Meiji thinker Okakura Tenshin’s declaration\nthat, while “Asia is one,” Japan alone is “the real\nrepository of the trust of Asiatic thought and culture” (Okakura\n2000, 1 and 5). \nWhere do the Kyoto School thinkers stand with respect to such culture\nwars? To be sure, the Chūōkōron discussions in\nparticular often asserted that modern Japan was uniquely suited to\ninstitute and represent the “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity\nSphere,” and this undoubtedly reflected a widespread post-Meiji\nJapanese conflation of political, industrial, and military development\nwith cultural superiority. Nishida also felt that modern Japan was in\na unique political and cultural position to host a fruitful marriage\nof East and West, and Tanabe went so far as to set the nation of Japan\nup as an archetype for others. In the Kyoto School’s wartime political\nwritings, there indeed remains much grist for the mills of\ncontemporary cultural critics, especially for those with hermeneutical\nblindfolds or purportedly perfect hindsight vision. Yet a critique of\ntheir political misadventures, as necessary as it is, may in fact\nreveal something more peripheral than central to the cross-cultural\nthinking of the Kyoto School. It is at least necessary to keep both\neyes open: one ready to criticize and the other willing to learn. \nWe should note that even when Nishida broadly contrasts “Western\nbeing” with “Eastern nothingness,” he in fact\nimmediately goes on to explore finer distinctions between the Greek,\nRoman, and Judeo-Christian threads of the Western tradition, and\nbetween the Indian, Chinese, and Japanese threads of the Eastern\ntradition. If his essentializing or overgeneralizing of these threads\ndoes remain in various respects problematic, it is nevertheless hardly\nthe case that he and the other Kyoto School thinkers never questioned\nthe homogeneity of either “the East” or “the\nWest.” Secondly, although they have been accused both of\ncontributing to the “myth of Japanese uniqueness” and of\n“reverse Orientalism” (see Dale 1986 and Faure 1995), the\ncase is far from this simple. In a time of uncritical cultural\nself-adulation by the Japanese ultranationalists in power, Nishida\nboldly urged that “both the strong points and weaknesses of our\nculture should be openly and honestly pointed out,” for\n“we cannot take any one culture and call it the\nculture” (Nishida 1964, 351 and 353). \nFighting a conceptual war simultaneously on two fronts, against\nWestern and Japanese ethnocentrisms, Nishida wrote that\n“until now Westerners have thought that their own culture is the\nmost superior human culture that exists, and that human culture\ninevitably develops in the direction of their own culture—hence,\nas Easterners and other peoples who are lagging behind advance\nforward, they must become the same as [Westerners].” Even some\nJapanese, he regrets, think this way. And yet, he objects,\n“there is something radically different in [the culture of] the\nEast.” According to Nishida, the development of the West will\nsubsume this difference no more than the East will subsume the West.\nEven if humanity does share a common root (what he calls, adapting an\nexpression from Goethe, an “ur-culture” of multiple\npossibilities), the development of its branches and leaves is a matter\nof diversification, not homogenization. Globalization should thus be\nthought of, in Nishida’s vision, as many branches of the same tree\nsupplementing one other on the basis of both their deep-rooted\ncommonality and their irreducible diversity (NKZ XIV,\n402–6 and 417). \nTo be sure, there inevitably remains for us the question of the\n“place” and manner in which this global communication\nbetween cultures should take place. But without a “view from\nnowhere,” can we not only ever attempt to critically and\ncreatively take up ideas that have particular genealogies and\ndialogically develop them into what are provisionally more universally\nviable forms? Just as concepts of democracy, hermeneutics, and indeed\nphilosophia itself have particular cultural lineages, so do\nthe ideas of śūnyatā, mu, and the\ntrue self as a non-ego that opens itself to an encounter with others\nby radically emptying itself. Nevertheless, all of these ideas may\nvery well contribute something to an intercultural dialogue concerning\nthe very place and manner in which a genuine encounter between\ncultures and individuals can and should take place. \nIt is not, therefore, necessarily ethnocentric for Japanese thinkers\nto suggest the potential efficacy of introducing into a global\nphilosophical dialogue ideas that derive from Japanese or Eastern\ntraditions. The “Japanese philosophy” of the Kyoto School\nis best understood as a contribution to such an intercultural\nconversation, and not merely as a reactive opposition to philosophical\nEurocentrism. In any case, we must be careful in how we understand the\nnoun “philosophy” and the modifier “Japanese”\nwhen we speak of “Japanese philosophy.” \nThe Kyoto School has never doubted that “philosophy,” in\nthe historically specific sense, is originally a cultural product of\nthe Western tradition. But they also recognize that it, like Western\nscience and technology, has universal implications that can be\ndeveloped by peoples around the globe. This does not mean that they\nthink Western philosophy is free of unrecognized cultural biases and\nlimitations, or that traditional Eastern thought has nothing essential\nto offer the development of philosophy in a post-Eurocentric world.\nThey recognize the difference between the global potentialities and\nthe still parochial actualities of philosophy, and their Japanese\ncontributions aim to make philosophy more, not less, worldly. \nIn an illuminating study of the debates surrounding the concept of\n“philosophy” in Japan since the Meiji period\n(1868–1912), John Maraldo has isolated four senses in which the\nnotion of “Japanese philosophy” has been used: (1) Western\nphilosophy as it happens to be practiced by Japanese scholars; (2)\ntraditional Japanese thought (Confucian, Nativist, Buddhist, etc.) as\nit was formulated prior to the introduction of Western philosophy; (3)\na form of inquiry which has methods and themes that are Western in\norigin, but that can be applied to pre-modern, pre-Westernized,\nJapanese thinking; and (4) a kind of reverse Orientalism that asserts\nthe superiority of specifically Japanese ways of thinking. \nMaraldo argues for the superior viability of the third of these\nconceptions, in part because it pays due hermeneutical attention to\nthe Greek origins of the heretofore prevailing methods and themes of\n“philosophy.” And yet, crucially, he also stresses that\nthe very methods and themes of philosophy are essentially always\n“in the making,” and that the production of\n“Japanese philosophy” will have to “strike a balance\nbetween reading (pre-defined) philosophy into [Japan’s traditional]\ntexts and reading alternatives out of them, constructing contrasts to\nthat [pre-defined] philosophy [of the West]” (Maraldo 2004,\n238–44). The Kyoto School in particular can be understood to\nhave taken up the challenge of critically and creatively appropriating\nphilosophy so as to free up for questioning many of its pre-defined\nWestern conceptions. \nA text by Ueda on Nishitani’s philosophy insightfully addresses the\nquestion of the adjective, “Japanese,” as follows:\n“If we are to use the characterization ‘Japanese’,\nthis does not signify merely a particularity of Japan, but rather must\nbe understood in the sense that a certain area of universal primal\nhuman possibility has been historically realized particularly in\nJapan. Hence, ‘European’ does not straightaway mean\n‘global’, but rather that a certain area of universal\nprimal human possibility has been historically realized particularly\nin Europe. … If we understand ourselves as the\nparticularization of something universal, this means, at the same\ntime, that we can understand others as different particularizations of\nsomething universal. Only then, with the communication between\nparticular and particular, can something universal come to be\nrealized” (Ueda 1996, 309). \nIn this passage, which recalls Nishida’s vision of communication\nbetween diversely determined branches of a shared yet essentially\nindeterminate root ur-culture, Ueda gives us a clue as to how we might\nbest understand the cross-cultural contributions of the Kyoto School.\nThey are philosophers who strive to express something universal from a\nparticular standpoint. But this does not at all mean that they attempt\nto reduce universality to their own particularity; for the latter is\nin turn understood as one particular expression of the formless\nur-culture, the indeterminate source of possibilities for individual\nand cultural determination, that is to say, the originary nothingness\nthat we all share. The Kyoto School thus presents us with a unique set\nof attempts to give philosophical form to this formless wellspring of\nboth commonality and singularity. \nThe degree to which the Kyoto School thinkers were successful in their\nboldly paradoxical quest to give philosophical form to the formless\ncan be debated. It is less easy to deny the exigency of the quest\nitself. If philosophy today is to mature beyond its Eurocentric\npubescence, then it is necessary to deepen its quest for universality\nby way of radically opening it up to a diversity of cultural\nperspectives. If cultural pluralism, for its part, is to avoid falling\ninto a relativistic antagonism or isolationism, it must entail a\nmetamorphosis rather than an abandonment of the philosophical quest\nfor universality (see Fujita 2013; Maraldo 2013). In any case, we\nshould understand the thought of the Kyoto School, not as exclusively\nJapanese versions of philosophy, but rather as Japanese contributions\nto the content of—and indeed to the very formation of the forum\nof—a global dialogue of philosophy in the making.","contact.mail":"bwdavis@loyola.edu","contact.domain":"loyola.edu"}]
