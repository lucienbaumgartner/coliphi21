It sank into\nan almost complete oblivion during the twentieth, when it was eclipsed\nby neopositivism. However, Comte’s decision to develop\nsuccessively a philosophy of mathematics, a philosophy of physics, a\nphilosophy of chemistry and a philosophy of biology, makes him the\nfirst philosopher of science in the modern sense, and his constant\nattention to the social dimension of science resonates in many\nrespects with current points of view. His political philosophy, on the\nother hand, is even less known, because it differs substantially from\nthe classical political philosophy we have inherited.\n\n\nComte’s most important works are (1) the Course on Positive\nPhilosophy (1830–1842, six volumes, translated and condensed by\nHarriet Martineau as The Positive Philosophy of Auguste\nComte); (2) the System of Positive Polity, or Treatise on\nSociology, Instituting the Religion of Humanity, (1851–1854, four\nvolumes); and (3) the Early Writings (1820–1829), where one\ncan see the influence of Saint-Simon, for whom Comte served as\nsecretary from 1817 to 1824. The Early Writings are still the\nbest introduction to Comte’s thought. In the Course, Comte\nsaid, science was transformed into philosophy; in the \nSystem, philosophy was transformed into religion. The second\ntransformation met with strong opposition; as a result, it has become\ncustomary to distinguish, with Mill, between a “good\nComte” (the author of the Course) and a “bad\nComte” (the author of the System). Today’s common\nconception of positivism corresponds mainly to what can be found in\nthe Course.  \n\n\nIt is difficult today to appreciate the interest Comte’s thought\nenjoyed a century ago, for it has received almost no notice during the\nlast five decades. Before the First World War, Comte’s movement was\nactive nearly everywhere in the world (Plé 1996; Simon\n1963). The best known case is that of Latin America: Brazil, which\nowes the motto on its flag ‘Ordem e Progresso’ (Order and\nProgress) to Comte (Trindade 2003), and Mexico (Hale 1989) are two\nprominent examples. The positivists, i.e., the followers of Comte,\nwere equally active in England (Wright 1986), the United States\n(Cashdollars 1989; Harp 1994) and India (Forbes 1975). And in the case\nof Turkey, its modern secular character can be traced to Comte’s\ninfluence on the Young Turks.  None of this activity survived the First World War. The new\nbalance of power created by the Russian Revolution left no room for\npositive polity, and Comtean positivism was taken over by\nneo-positivism in philosophy of science. The term\n‘post-positivism’, used in the second half of the 20th\ncentury, demonstrates the complete disappearance of what one might\ncall, in retrospect, “paleo-positivism”. As a matter of\nfact, post-positivism is a kind of “post-neo-positivism”,\nsince the well-known criticisms launched by Kuhn and Feyerabend were\ndirected at Carnap’s neopositivism, not Comte’s positivism, about\nwhich they seem to have known very little.  This shows that their use\nof “positivism” forgets totally Comte, who is nevertheless\nthe man who coined the term. Moreover, in a number of cases, the\npost-positivists simply rediscovered points that were well established\nin paleo-positivism (such as the need to take into account the context\nof justification and the social dimension of science) but subsequently\nforgotten. \nThis unexpected agreement between the paleo- and post-positivists\nshows that there is some enduring substance to Comte’s original\nthinking and partially explains why Comtean studies have seen a strong\nrevival of late (Bourdeau 2007). Philosophers and sociologists have\nbegun to draw attention to the interesting views defended over a\ncentury and a half ago by the founder of positivism.  It thus seems\nthat the eclipse of the original positivism is nearing its end.\n \nOne quickly notices the gap between the meaning that\n‘positivism’ had for Comte in the 19th century and the\nmeaning that it has come to have in our times.  Thus, contrary to what\nis usually thought, Comte’s positivism is not a philosophy of science\nbut a political philosophy.  Or, if one prefers, Comte’s positivism is\na remarkable philosophy that doesn’t separate philosophy of science\nfrom political philosophy. The title of what Comte always regarded as\nhis seminal work (written in 1822 when he was only 24 years old)\nleaves no doubt as to the bond between science and politics: it is\nPlan for the Scientific Work Necessary to Reorganize Society,\nalso called First System of Positive Polity. Its goal is the\nreorganization of society. Science gets involved only after politics,\nwhen Comte suggests calling in scientists to achieve that goal.  So,\nwhile science plays a central role in positive polity, positivism is\nanything but a blind admiration for science. From 1847, positivism is\nplaced under the ‘continuous dominance of the heart’\n(la préponderance continue du coeur), and the motto\n‘Order and Progress’ becomes ‘Love as principle,\norder as basis, progress as end’ (L’amour pour principe,\nl’ordre pour base et le progrès pour but). This turn,\nunexpected for many of his contemporaries, was in fact well motivated\nand is characteristic of the very dynamics of Comte’s thought. \nThe ‘complete positivism’ of what Comte himself called his\n‘second career’ has on the whole been judged\nseverely. Very quickly, the most famous admirers of the\nearly Course of Positive Philosophy (1830–1842), such\nas Mill and Littré, disavowed the author of the\nlater System of Positive Polity (1851–1854), thereby\ngiving substance to the idea that there is a good and a bad\nComte. Nevertheless, if his early writings call for a revision of the\nstandard interpretation of positivism, this is even more the case for\nthe works of his ‘second career’. \nFrom these introductory remarks, some of the main threads of what\nfollows can already be seen. First, whatever the exact worth of the\ntwo groups of writings that surround it may be, the Course of\nPositive Philosophy (hereafter Course) remains Comte’s\nmajor contribution. Second, an interpretation of the whole of Comte’s\nwork is confronted with two problems. The first problem concerns the\nunity of Comte’s thought: do the first and the second career form a\ncontinuum, or is there a break? The second problem concerns Comte’s\nrelationship to Saint-Simon (see below 3.2.): is the founder of\npositivism merely one Saint-Simonian among others, as Durkheim\nmaintained, or should one, as Gouhier (1933) proposed, follow Comte\nhimself, who on this matter spoke of a ‘disastrous\ncontact’ that had, at best, merely hindered his\n‘spontaneous development’ (1830 (56), v. 2,\n 466)?[1].  \nAs an approach to Comte’s philosophy, the chronological order\nseems the most appropriate guide. After a quick review of some\nbiographical facts, we will deal first with the Saint-Simonian period\nand the early writings, and then with the two great works that stand\nout: the Course of Positive Philosophy (six volumes,\n1830–1842), and the System of Positive Polity (four\nvolumes, 1851–1854). \n\nComte was born in Montpellier on January 20, 1798 (‘le 1er\npluviôse de l’an VI’, according to the Revolutionary\ncalendar then in use in France). Having displayed his brilliance in\nschool, he was ranked fourth on the admissions list of the\nÉcole Polytechnique in Paris in 1814. Two years later, the\nBourbons closed that institution, and its students were dismissed. In\nAugust 1817, Auguste Comte met Henri de Saint-Simon, who appointed him\nas his secretary to replace Augustin Thierry. The young Comte was thus\ninitiated into politics and was able to publish a great number of\narticles, which placed him very much in the public eye. (The most\nimportant of these articles were republished by him in 1854 and remain\nthe best introduction to his oeuvre as a whole.) In April 1824, he\nbroke with Saint-Simon. Shortly afterward, in a civil wedding, he\nmarried Caroline Massin, who had been living with him for several\nmonths. In April 1826, Comte began teaching a Course of Positive\nPhilosophy, whose audience included some of the most famous\nscientists of the time (Fourier, A. von Humboldt,\nPoinsot). It was suddenly interrupted because of a ‘cerebral\ncrisis’ due to overwork and conjugal sorrows. Comte was then\nhospitalized in the clinic of Dr. Esquirol. Upon leaving, he was\nclassified as ‘not cured’.  He recovered gradually, thanks\nto the devotion and patience of his wife. \nThe resumption of the Course of Positive Philosophy in\nJanuary 1829, marks the beginning of a second period in Comte’s life\nthat lasted 13 years and included the publication of the six volumes\nof the Course (1830, 1835, 1838, 1839, 1841, 1842). In\naddition, during this period, more and more of his ties with the\nacademic world were severed. After being named tutor in analysis and\nmechanics at the École Polytechnique in 1832, in 1833 he sought\nto create a chair in general history of science at the Collège\nde France, but to no avail. Two unsuccessful candidacies for the rank\nof professor at the École Polytechnique led him in 1842 to\npublish a ‘personal preface’ to the last volume of\nthe Course, which put him at odds with the university world\nforever. The two years that followed mark a period of transition. In\nquick succession, Comte published an Elementary Treatise on\nAnalytic Geometry (1843), his only mathematical work, and\nthe Philosophical Treatise on Popular Astronomy (1844), the\nfruit of a yearly course, begun in 1830, for Parisian workers. The\nDiscourse on the Positive Spirit, also from 1844, which he\nused as the preface to the treatise on astronomy, marked a sharp\nchange of direction by its emphasis on the moral dimension of the new\nphilosophy: now that the sciences had been systematized, Comte was\nable to return to his initial interest, political philosophy. Public\nrecognition of the positivist Comte, as opposed to the saint-simonian,\ntwenty years earlier, came with Émile Littré’s articles\nin Le National.  \nThe year 1844 also marked his first encounter with Clotilde de Vaux.\nWhat followed was the ‘year like none other’ that launched\nwhat Comte himself called his ‘second career’. The main\ntheme of the second career was the ‘continuous dominance of the\nheart’. An abundant correspondence testifies to Comte’s passion,\nwho, in spite of a heavy teaching load, found the time to start\nworking on the System of Positive Polity, which he had\nannounced at the end of the Course. After Clotilde’s death,\nin April 1846, Comte began to idolize her, to such an extent that it\nbecame a true cult. A few months later, his correspondence with Mill,\nbegun in December 1841, came to an end. The next year, Comte chose the\nevolution of Humanity as the new topic for his public course; this was\nan occasion to lay down the premises of what would become the new\nReligion of Humanity. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the\nrevolution of 1848: he founded the Positivist Society, modelled after\nthe Club of the Jacobins, and published the General View of\nPositivism, conceived of as an introduction to\nthe System to come, as well as the Positivist\nCalendar. In 1849, he founded the Religion of Humanity. \nThe years 1851–1854 were dominated by the publication of the\nfour-volume System of Positive Polity, which was\ninterrupted for a few months in order for him to write the\nCatechism of Positive Religion (1852). Relieved of all his\nduties at the École Polytechnique, Comte now lived off of the\n‘voluntary subsidy’ begun by the followers of his in England and\nnow also granted to him from various countries. In December\n1851, Comte applauded the coup d’état by Napoleon III, who put\nan end to the parliamentary ‘anarchy’. Littré refused\nto follow Comte on this point, as on the question of religion, and\nbroke with him shortly after. Soon disappointed by the Second Empire,\nComte shifted his hopes to Czar Nicholas I, to whom he wrote. In 1853,\nHarriet Martineau published a condensed English translation of the\nCourse of Positive Philosophy. \nDisappointed by the unenthusiastic response his work got from the\nworkers, Comte launched an Appeal to Conservatives in\n1855. The next year, he published the first volume of a work on the\nphilosophy of mathematics announced in 1842, under the new title\nof Subjective Synthesis, or Universal System of the Conceptions\nAdapted to the Normal State of Humanity. Increasingly occupied by his\nfunction as High Priest of Humanity, he sent an emissary to the\nJesuits in Rome proposing an alliance with the\n‘Ignacians’. \nComte died on September 5, 1857, without having had time to draft\nthe texts announced up to 35 years before: a Treatise of Universal\nEducation, which he thought he could publish in 1858, a System\nof Positive Industry, or Treatise on the Total Action of Humanity on\nthe Planet, planned for 1861, and, finally, for 1867, a\nTreatise of First Philosophy. He is buried in the\nPère-Lachaise cemetery, where his Brazilian followers erected a\nstatue of Humanity in 1983. \nThe early writings remain the required starting point for everyone who\nwishes to understand the goal that Comte incessantly pursued. It is\nnot without reason that on the first page of the System Comte\napplied to himself Alfred de Vigny’s words: ‘What is a great\nlife? A thought of youth, executed by mature age.’ His formative\nyears were dominated by his relationship with Saint-Simon. When\nmeeting him in 1817, Comte, like his fellow students at the\nÉcole Polytechnique, had just been dismissed by Louis XVIII and\nwas therefore looking for a job. He even thought of emigrating to the\nUnited States to teach at a school that Jefferson was planning to open\nand which was to be modeled on the École Polytechnique. The\nÉcole Polytechnique, whose faculty included the likes of Arago,\nLaplace, Cauchy, and Poisson, had been for Comte what\nthe Evangelisches Stift in Tübingen had been for\nHegel. There, he got an education in science that was second to none\nin all of Europe; it left a permanent imprint on him. But he was\nequally a typical representative of the generation of Tocqueville and\nGuizot that saw itself confronted with the question of how to stop the\nRevolution after the collapse of the Empire. ‘How,’ as\nComte would put it in 1848, ‘does one reorganize human life,\nirrespectively of God and king’? (1851, v. 1, 127; E.,\nv. 1, 100) It is from this perspective that his profound\nhostility towards classical political philosophy —philosophy\nthat we continue to respect today— has to be understood. With\nits insistence on freedom of conscience and on the sovereignty of the\npeople (souveraineté populaire), the revolutionary\ndoctrine had no other function than to destroy the Ancien\nRégime (founded on papal authority and monarchy by divine\nright). But in that task it had now succeeded. The moment had come for\nreconstruction, and it was hard to see how these weapons could be of\nuse in such work. \nUnder these circumstances, it is not surprising that the young Comte\nturned to Saint-Simon. The latter, taking advantage of the relative\nfreedom of the press granted by Louis XVIII, published more and more\npamphlets and magazines, and therefore needed a collaborator. Comte\ntook over three ideas from the complex thought of\nSaint-Simon: \nComte quickly assimilated what Saint-Simon had to offer him. But Comte\naspired to free himself of a tutelage that weighed ever heavier on\nhim, as he found the unmethodical and fickle mind of the self-taught,\nphilanthropic aristocrat barely tolerable. The break occurred in 1824,\noccasioned by a shorter work of Comte that would prove to be\nfundamental. Aware of already possessing the main ideas of his own\nphilosophy, Comte accused his teacher of trying to appropriate his\nwork and furthermore, he pointed out that he had not contented himself\nwith giving a systematic form to borrowed\nconcepts. The Philosophical Considerations on the Sciences and the\nScientists (1825) contains the first and classical formulations\nof the two cornerstones of positivism: the law of the three stages,\nand the classification of the sciences. The Considerations on\nSpiritual Power that followed some months later presents\ndogmatism as the normal state of the human mind. It is not difficult\nto find behind that statement, which may seem outrageous to us, the\nanti-Cartesianism that Comte shares with Peirce and that brings their\nphilosophies closer to one another. As the mind spontaneously stays\nwith what seems true to it, the irritation of doubt ceases when belief\nis fixed; what is in need of justification, one might say, is not the\nbelief but the doubt. Thus the concept of positive faith is brought\nout, that is to say, the necessity of a social theory of belief and\nits correlate, the logical theory of authority. \nIn the year 1826 two major events take place. First, Comte’s program\nwas reshaped. The first System of 1822 was unfinished, and\nwriting the remaining part was one of Comte’s priorities. But in 1826\nhe postponed that project for an indeterminate period. To provide a\nmore solid base for the social science and its resulting positive\npolity, he decided first to go through the whole of positive knowledge\nagain and to begin a course on positive philosophy. It should be kept\nin mind that the Course does not belong to Comte’s initial\nprogram and that it originally was meant as a parenthesis, or prelude,\nthat was supposed to take a few years at most. The second major event\nof 1826, the famous ‘cerebral crisis’ which occurred\nimmediately after the opening lecture of the course forced Comte to\nstop his public lessons; but it also had longstanding effects. Thus it\nis customary to say that Comte received public acknowledgement only\nbelatedly: in 1842, with the first letter from Mill, and in 1844, with\nthe articles of Littré in Le National. But that\namounts to forgetting that in 1826 Comte was a well-known personality\nin the intellectual circles of Paris. Guizot\nand Lamennais held him in high esteem. The\nCourse’s attendance list included prestigious names such as\nA. von Humboldt, Arago, Broussais or Fourier.  Mill, who had visited\nSaint-Simon in 1820–21, was deeply impressed by the first\nSystem, which one of Comte’s pupils had introduced him to in\n1829 (Mill 1963, v. 12, 34).  Finally, even though Comte had broken\nwith Saint-Simon, the general public saw him as one of the master’s\nmost authoritative spokesmen. This earned him the somewhat peculiar\nanimosity of the Saint-Simonians: they, with few exceptions, had the\ndistinctive characteristic of never having personally known the one\nthey called ‘the father’, whereas Comte had been on\nintimate terms with him. However, the cerebral crisis made Comte\nunable to take advantage of the high regard he enjoyed: he disappeared\nfrom the public scene until 1844. \nAs said in its first lesson, the Course pursues two goals.\nThe first, a specific one, is a foundation for sociology, then called\n‘social physics’. The second, a general goal, is the\ncoordination of the whole of positive knowledge. The structure of the\nwork reflects this duality: the first three volumes examine the five\nfundamental sciences then in existence (mathematics, astronomy,\nphysics, chemistry, biology), and the final three volumes deal with\nthe social sciences. Executing the two parts did not require the same\namount of work. In the first case, the sciences had already been\nformed and it was just a matter of summarizing their main doctrinal\nand methodological points.  In the other case, however, all was still\nto be done, and Comte was well aware that he was founding a new\nscience. \nThe structure of the Course explains why the law of the three\nstages (which is often the only thing known about Comte) is stated\ntwice. Properly speaking, the law belongs to dynamic sociology or\ntheory of social progress, and this is why it serves as an\nintroduction to the long history lessons in the fifth and sixth\nvolumes. But it equally serves as an introduction to the work as a\nwhole, to the extent that its author considers this law the best way\nto explain what positive philosophy is. \nThe law states that, in its development, humanity passes through three\nsuccessive stages: the theological, the metaphysical, and the\npositive. The first is the necessary starting point for the human\nmind; the last, its normal state; the second is but a transitory stage\nthat makes possible the passage from the first to the last. In the\ntheological stage, the human mind, in its search for the primary and\nfinal causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the\nuniverse as interventions of supernatural agents. The second stage is\nonly a simple modification of the first: the questions remain the\nsame, but in the answers supernatural agents are replaced by abstract\nentities. In the positive state, the mind stops looking for causes of\nphenomena, and limits itself strictly to laws governing them;\nlikewise, absolute notions are replaced by relative ones.  Moreover,\nif one considers material development, the theological stage may also\nbe called military, and the positive stage industrial; the\nmetaphysical stage corresponds to a supremacy of the lawyers and\n jurists.[2]. \nThis relativism of the third stage is the most characteristic property\nof positivism.  It is often mistakenly identified with scepticism, but\nour earlier remark about dogmatism prevents us from doing so. \nFor Comte, science is a “connaissance approchée”:\nit comes closer and closer to truth, without reaching it. There is no\nplace for absolute truth, but neither are there higher standards for\nthe fixation of belief. Comte is here quite close to Peirce in his\nfamous 1877 paper.  \nThe law of the three stages belongs to those grand philosophies of\nhistory elaborated in the 19th century, which now seem quite alien to\nus (for a different opinion, see Schmaus (1982)). The idea of progress\nof Humanity appears to us as the expression of an optimism that the\nevents of the 20th century have done much to reduce (Bourdeau\n2006). More generally, the notion of a law of history is problematic\n(even though it did not seem so to Mill (1842, bk. VI,\nchap. X)). Already Durkheim felt forced to exclude social\ndynamics from sociology, in order to give it a truly scientific\nstatus.  \nThese difficulties, however, are far from fatal to this aspect of\nComte’s thought. Putting aside the fact that the idea of moral\nprogress is slowly regaining some support, it is possible to interpret\nthe three stages as forms of the mind that co-exist whose relative\nimportance varies in time. This interpretation seems to be offered by\nComte himself, who gives several examples of it in his history\nlessons. The germs of positivity were present from the beginning of\nthe theological stage; with Descartes, the whole of natural philosophy\nreaches the positive stage, while moral philosophy remains in the\nmetaphysical stage (1830 (58), v. 2, 714–715). \nThe second pillar of positive philosophy, the law of the\nclassification of the sciences, has withstood the test of time much\nbetter than the law of the three stages. Of the various\nclassifications that have been proposed, it is Comte’s that is still\nthe most popular today. This classification, too,\nstructures the Course, which examines each of the six\nfundamental sciences—mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry,\nbiology, sociology—in turn. It provides a way to do justice to\nthe diversity of the sciences without thereby losing sight of their\nunity. This classification also makes Comte the founder of the\nphilosophy of science in the modern sense. From Plato to Kant,\nreflection on science had always occupied a central place in\nphilosophy, but the sciences had to be sufficiently developed for\ntheir diversity to manifest itself. It was thanks to his education at\nthe École Polytechnique that Comte, from 1818, began to develop\nthe concept of a philosophy of science. At about the same time Bolzano\nwrote his Wissenschaftslehre (1834) and Mill his System\nof Logic (1843), Comte’s Course presented in sequence a\nphilosophy of mathematics, of astronomy, of physics, of chemistry, of\nbiology, and of sociology. Comte’s classification is meant not to\nrestore a chimerical unity, but to avoid the fragmentation of\nknowledge. Thanks to it, the sciences are related to one another in an\nencyclopedic scale that goes from the general to the particular, and\nfrom the simple to the complex: moving from mathematics to sociology,\ngenerality decreases and complexity increases. \nThe law of classification of the sciences also has a historical\naspect: it gives us the order in which the sciences develop.  For\nexample, astronomy requires mathematics, and chemistry requires\nphysics. Each science thus rests upon the one that precedes it. As\nComte puts it, the higher depends on the lower, but is not its\nresult. The recognition of an irreducible diversity already contains a\ndisavowal of reductionism (in Comte’s wording:\n‘materialism’), which the classification allows one to\nmake explicit. The positivist clearly sees that the tendency towards\nreductionism is fed by the development of scientific knowledge itself,\nwhere each science participates in the evolution of the next; but\nhistory also teaches us that each science, in order to secure its own\nsubject matter, has to fight invasions by the preceding\none. ‘Thus it appears that Materialism is a danger inherent in\nthe mode in which the scientific studies necessary as a preparation\nfor Positivism were pursued. Each science tended to absorb the one\nnext to it, on the grounds of having reached the positive stage\nearlier and more thoroughly.’ (1851, v. 1, 50; E.,\nv. 1, 39) \nWhile philosophers of science have always recognized the place of\nComte in the history of their discipline, the philosophy of science\npresented in the Course, and a fortiori the one in\nthe System, have hardly been studied (Laudan 1981). Comte’s\nphilosophy of science is based on a systematic\ndifference between method and doctrine. These are, to use Comtean\nterminology, opposed to one another, as the logical point of view and\nthe scientific point of view. Method is presented as superior to\ndoctrine: scientific doctrines change (that is what\n“progress” means), but the value of science lies in its\nmethods. At the level of doctrine, mathematics has a status of its\nown, well indicated in the second lesson, where it is presented last,\nand as if to make up for something forgotten. As much as it is itself\na body of knowledge, it is an instrument of discovery in the other\nsciences, an ‘organon’ in the Aristotelian sense. Among\nthe remaining sciences, leaving sociology aside for the moment, two\noccupy a pre-eminent place: \nThe positive method comes in different forms, according to the science\nwhere it is applied: in astronomy it is observation, in physics\nexperimentation, in biology comparison. The same point of view is also\nbehind the general theory of hypotheses in the 28th lesson, a\ncenterpiece of the positive philosophy of science. \nFinally, classification is the key to a theory of technology. The\nreason is that there exists a systematic connection between complexity\nand modifiability: the more complex a phenomenon is, the more\nmodifiable it is. The order of nature is a modifiable order. Human\naction takes place within the limits fixed by nature and consists in\nreplacing the natural order by an artificial one. Comte’s\neducation as an engineer had made him quite aware of the links between\nscience and its applications, which he summarized in an oft-quoted\nslogan: ‘From science comes prevision, from prevision comes\naction’. Only death prevented him from writing the System of\nPositive Industry, or Treatise on the Total Action of Humanity on the\nPlanet, announced as early as 1822. \nSociology has a double status. It is not just one science among the\nothers, as though there is the science of society just as there is a\nscience of living beings.  Rather, sociology is the science that comes\nafter all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the\ntask of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge. With\nsociology, positivity takes possession of the last domain that had\nheretofore escaped it and had been considered forever inaccessible to\nit. Many people thought that social phenomena are so complex that\nthere can be no science of them. Dilthey’s idea\nof Geisteswissenschaft, for instance, is explicitly directed\nagainst positivism and maintains the difference between natural\nphilosophy and moral philosophy. On the contrary, according to Comte,\nthis distinction, introduced by the Greeks, is abolished by the\nexistence of sociology, and the unity that was lost with the birth of\nmetaphysics restored (1830 (58), v. 2, 713–715).  \nFounding social science therefore constitutes a turn\nin the history of humanity. Until then, the positive spirit was\ncharacterized by the objective method, which works its way from the\nworld to man; but as this goal has now been reached, it becomes\npossible to invert that direction and go from man to world, to adopt,\nin other words, the subjective method, which so far had been\nassociated with the anthropomorphism of theology. To legitimize that\nmethod, it suffices to substitute sociology for theology, —\nwhich is equivalent to substituting the relative for the absolute:\nwhereas God may say to the soul, as in the Imitatio, “I\nam necessary to you and you are useless to me”,\n Humanity[3]\n is the most dependent of all beings. In the first case, to say that\nGod need us is blasphemy: it would be denying his perfection. The\nsecond case is in some respects a mere consequence of the\nclassification of sciences, if we agree to consider humanity as the\nproper object of sociology. Each science depends on the precedent; as\nthe final science, sociology is the most dependent one. Human life\ndepends for instance on astronomical conditions. Humanity depends also\non each of us, on what we do and not do; on another sense, of course,\neach of us depends on humanity, as said by the law of human\norder: les vivants sont nécessairement et de plus en plus\ngouvernés par les morts.  \nTo bring out this eminent place of sociology is the\nprincipal aim of the General Conclusions of\nthe Course. The 58th lesson raises the question of which\nscience presides over the others on the encyclopedic scale. To\nguarantee the harmonious development of the various sciences taken\ntogether, the dominance of one among them has to be assumed. Until\nrecently, that role had been played by mathematics, but ‘it will\nnot be forgotten that a cradle is not a throne’ (1830 (58),\nv. 2, 718; E., v. 2, 510) (Bourdeau 2004). One should\ndistinguish the first blossoming of the positive spirit from its\nsystematic development. The human point of view, that is to say, the\nsocial point of view, is the only one that is truly universal; now\nthat sociology is born, it is up to it to be in charge of the\ndevelopment of knowledge. \nIt goes without saying that Comte’s idea of sociology was very\ndifferent from the current one. To ensure the positivity of their\ndiscipline, sociologists have been quick to renounce its coordinating\nfunction, also known as encyclopedic or architectonic function, which\ncharacterizes philosophy.  With its place at the top of the scale, the\nsociology of the Course recapitulates the whole of knowledge,\nwhile the sciences that precede it are but one immense introduction to\nthis final science. As a consequence, no one can become a sociologist\nwithout having had a solid encyclopedic education, one that has no\nplace for economics or social mathematics, but, on the contrary,\nemphasizes biology, the first science that deals with organized\nbeings. How far removed this is from today’s sociology curriculum! \nIf sociology merges at places with philosophy, it is also closely\nrelated to history. Comte was thus led to take a stand on a question\nthat deeply divides us today: how should the relations among\nphilosophy of science, history of science, and sociology of science be\nseen?  In the Course, history is at once everywhere and\nnowhere: it is not a discipline, but the method of sociology. Dynamic\nsociology is ‘a history without names of men, or even of\npeople’ (1830 (52), v. 2, 239). It is easy to understand,\nthen, that positivism has always refused to separate the philosophy of\nscience from the history of science. According to positivism, one does\nnot really know a science until one knows its history; indeed, it was\na chair in the general history of science that Comte had asked Guizot\nto create for him at the Collège de France. Mill’s position was\nnot quite the same, for he took the author of the Course to\ntask for neglecting the production of proof, or, to use modern\nvocabulary, for being more interested in the context of discovery than\nin the context of justification (Mill 1865). The criticism is only\npartly legitimate: from the second lesson in the Course,\nComte carefully distinguishes between the doctrinal and the historical\nstudy of science, opting for the first while leaving the second for\nthe lessons in sociology. Just as for Comte the philosophy of science\nis not a philosophy of nature but of the mind, he likewise values the\nhistory of science less as a subject in its own right than as the\n‘most important, yet so far most neglected part’ of the\ndevelopment of Humanity (1830 (2), v. 1, 53). Each science is\ntherefore examined twice in the Course: for its own sake, in\nthe first three volumes; in its relations to the general development\nof society, in the final three. In this way, Comte succeeds in\nreconciling the internalist and externalist points of view, usually\nconsidered to be incompatible. \nThe Course’s first readers were in Great Britain; the\nreform projects of the English Radicals had many points in common with\nthe positivist concerns. A reading of the first volumes made enough of\nan impression on Mill to induce him to write to their author. The\ncorrespondence that followed, which lasted from 1841 to 1846, is of\nconsiderable philosophical interest. In his first letter, Mill\npresents himself almost as a follower of Comte and recalls how, some\nten years before, it had been Comte’s 1822 work that had\nliberated him from Bentham’s influence.[4] But the tone of the\nletters, while remaining friendly, changes shortly thereafter. Mill\ndoes not hesitate to voice objections to Comte’s conception of biology\nand his excluding psychology from the sciences. In particular, Mill\nhad strong reservations about Gall’s phrenology, which Comte\nendorsed, and proposed to replace it with ethology. Their\ndisagreements crystallize around ‘la question\nféminine’—that is, the status of women in\nsociety— where it is possible to see how epistemological and\npolitical considerations are linked (Guillin 2007). \nAfter 1846, Mill quickly distanced himself from his correspondent. He\neven went so far to describe the Système as “the\ncompletest system of spiritual and temporal despotism which ever yet\nemanated from a human brain, unless possibly that of Ignatius\nLoyola” (Autobiography, 213). Such judgments—and\nthere are many— represent an extreme in a much more balanced\nglobal assessment. Comte’s later philosophy deserves criticism,\nbut Mill was able to see its strong points and mention them. The last\nsentences of Mill’s 1865 book give a good example of the unique\nway he manages to mix approval and harsh criticism: \nAnd earlier, he said: \nEven though each new edition of Mill’s System of Logic\nsaw fewer references to the Course than the previous one (in\nthe first edition there had been more than a hundred), Comte’s\ninfluence on Mill ran deep, the extent to which is greatly\nunderestimated today (Raeder 2002). Mill’s\nAutobiography is quite explicit on this point as Comte\nfigures much more prominently in it than Tocqueville with whom Mill\nhad been in contact for a longer time. Conversely, Mill contributed\nmuch to the spreading of positivism. His book on Comte (Mill 1865)\nenjoyed considerable success, and Mill himself was sometimes\nconsidered a positivist.[5] \nSoon after finishing the Course, Comte returned to his\ninitial project and began outlining the System of Positive\nPolity. The Discourse on the Positive Spirit, which had\nserved as the preface to the Philosophical Treatise on Popular\nAstronomy (1844), had already emphasized the social purpose of\npositivism and its aptitude to replace theology in politics and\nmorality. But his encounter with Clotilde de Vaux would turn his life\nupside down and give Comte’s second career an unexpected twist. \nAfter Clotilde’s death in 1846, positivism was transformed into\n“complete positivism”, which is ‘continuous\ndominance of the heart’ (la prépondérance\ncontinue du Coeur). ‘We tire of thinking and even of\nacting; we never tire of loving’, as the dedication to\nthe System put it. Positivism transformed science into\nphilosophy; complete positivism now transforms philosophy\ninto religion. The question whether such a move is consistent with\nComte’s former ideas and more generally with positivism was asked very\nearly. Mill and Littré answered negatively and complete\npositivism was never very popular.  \nThe transformation of philosophy into religion does not yield a\nreligion of science because, having overcome modern prejudices, Comte now\nunhesitatingly ranks art above science. Now that the break-up with the\nacademic world was complete, the positivists placed their hopes on an\nalliance with women and proletarians. Comte (who after Clotilde’s\ndeath obsessively, even cultishly, devoted himself to her) reserved a\ndecisive role in the positive era for women. However, this aspect of\nhis work is difficult to accept for a contemporary reader, in\nparticular because it involves the utopian idea of the virgin mother,\nwhich means parthenogenesis for human beings. As for the proletarians,\nhe saw them as spontaneous positivists, just as the positivists were\nsystematic proletarians! \nThe mind, then, is not destined to rule but to serve, not, however, as\nthe slave of the heart, but as its servant (Bourdeau 2000). Science\nthus retains an essential function. The dominance of the heart is\nfounded biologically in the ‘positive classification of the\neighteen internal functions of the brain, or systematic view of the\nsoul’ (1851, v. 1, 726; E., v. 1, 594–95). The\ncerebral table distinguishes ten affective forces, five intellectual\nfunctions, and three practical qualities; these correspond to the\nheart, mind, and character, respectively. The functions being ordered\naccording to increasing energy and decreasing dignity, the dominance\nof the heart can be considered a datum from positive biology. This\nclassification is indispensable for an understanding of\nthe System. It should be mentioned in passing that it shows\nthat the exclusion of psychology does not at all have the meaning\nusually given to it: Comte had never refused to study man’s higher\nfunctions, be they intellectual or moral, but for him this belongs to\nbiology (the classification is sometimes also referred to as the\n‘cerebral table’), and so does not require the creation of\na new science (1830 (45)).  Historically, the conception of\nthe System began with this table, of which different versions\nwere elaborated in succession from 1846. Conceptually, it is the first\napplication of the subjective method, understood as feedback from\nsociology to the sciences that precede it, starting with the\nnearest. In this way, the sociologist helps the biologist define the\ncerebral functions, a task in which, most often, the biologist simply\ntakes up again the divisions of folk psychology. Later, in what has\nbecome known as the ‘letters on illness’, Comte likewise\nproposes a sociological definition of the brain, as the organ through\nwhich dead people act on living ones. Today, we no longer associate positivism with politics. However,\nthe connection was present from the outset when Comte served as\nsecretary of Saint-Simon, and positive politics was quite influential\nat the end of the nineteenth century. The two main tenets of positive\npolitics are: there is no society without government; the proper\nfunctioning of society requires a spiritual power independent from the\ntemporal power. The first principle has two sides. The negative side expresses\nComte’s lack of interest in the concept of State. The positive\nside argues we must consider how social life works in order to\nunderstand why there must be a government. Surprisingly, Comte’s\nstarting point is the same as Hayek’s, namely the existence of a\nspontaneous order. The title of the fiftieth lesson of the\nCourse reads: Social statics, or theory of spontaneous\norder of human society. But, for positivism, spontaneous order\ncovers all natural phenomena and is neither perfect nor immutable. In\ngeneral, human action aims to substitute natural order with an\nartificial one more in line with our desires. Government action is\nonly a special case, applied to the spontaneous order intrinsic to\nhuman society, which is determined by division of labor. Increasing\nspecialization, which accompanies division of labor, threatens the\ncohesion of society even if it is the sine qua non condition of\nprogress. That is why a government is needed: its function is\n‘to check the disorganizing and to foster the converging\ntendencies’ of the agents (1852, 205; E. 277). Regarding the second principle: a spiritual power can only be\nunderstood in its relation to temporal power. A spiritual power, by\nnature, is a moderating power, and it presupposes the existence of a\ntemporal power, which in contrast does not presuppose the existence of\na spiritual power. Furthermore, Comte strongly disagrees with\nhistorical materialism: it is ideas that rule the world, in the sense\nthat there is no sustainable social order without a minimal consensus\non the principles that govern life in society. Initially, Comte\nplanned to entrust this new spiritual power to scientists, because he\nsaw science not only as the rational basis for our action upon nature,\nbut also as the spiritual basis of social order. For at least the last 50 years, positive politics has been\nunfavorably viewed as reactionary and totalitarian. And it is true\nthat, in many respects, Comte was resolutely anti-modern but,\nespecially in his later writings, he also held ideas which are in\nkeeping with contemporary concerns. For instance, he had an acute\nfeeling for the way humanity is dependent on astronomical conditions:\nassume small changes in the elliptical orbit of Earth, in the\ninclination of Ecliptic, and life, at least life as we know it, would\nhave been impossible. Humanity, the proper study of sociology, is\nclosely connected to the Earth, the human planet, ‘with its\ngaseous and liquid envelopes’ (Comte 1851 [1875], 429). In spite\nof the Copernican revolution, Earth remains for each of us the firm,\nunshakable ground upon which everything stands. See for instance what\nComte says about fatherland and the way ‘the Tent, the Car or\nthe Ship are to the nomad family a sort of moveable Country,\nconnecting the Family or the Horde with its material basis, as with us\nthe [Roma] in his van’ (1851, v. 2 285, E. 2 237). Politics is\ngrounded in geopolitics, where  geo  retains its etymological\nmeaning, Gaia, and where Earth is understood as a planet in the solar\nsystem.  This cosmic character of positive politics helps to understand what\ncould appear as an inconsistency. After 1851, Comte proposed to divide\nFrance into nineteen ‘intendances’. Such a suggestion is\nquite puzzling since it is incompatible with the received view that he\nwas a supporter of centralisation. However, the inconsistency\ndisappears as soon as we take into account the distinction between\ntemporal power and spiritual power. Centralisation applies only to\nspiritual power (Comte had clearly in mind the Papacy) and temporal\npower is by nature local. There are many passages where the\ncorrelation is clearly stated. This follows from the fact that the\nmind is not limited by boundaries; a spiritual power has no choice but\nto be catholic, that is, universal. Its domain is the planet\nEarth. From this, we have at least two consequences. The first one is a\nstrong interest in European reconstruction, a political priority\nbetween 1815 and 1820, but not anymore in 1850, after the triumph of\nnationalism. The second one is the realization that State as a concept\nis a historical product which did not exist before 1500, and there is\nno reason to believe that States will exist for ever. Hence his\nproposal to divide France into nineteen ‘intendances’: the\nextension of temporal power is not allowed to go beyond territories\nlike Belgium or Corsica. Comte was also one of the first anti-colonialists. As the place\nwhere positive thinking appeared and developed, Comte considered\nEurope a leader of humanity (1851 [1875], 313), but the way it took\npossession of the planet in modern times contradicts the very idea\npositivism had of Europe’s place in history. Much before\nsocialists, English positivists objected to Victorian imperialism (see\nClaeys 2008). In this context, Comte and his followers also discussed\nextensively the respective merits of Christianity and Islam. Turks\nwere greatly appreciative of Comte and his followers’\nsecularism, which represented a solution to many of the problems of\nthe Ottoman Empire. Ahmed Reza, an influent politician, was overtly\npositivist. Atatürk and the Young Turks were strongly influenced\nby them. \nThe System’s subtitle is Treatise on Sociology\nInstituting the Religion of Humanity. While the different forms\nof deism preserve the idea of God and dissolve religion into a vague\nreligiosity, Comte proposes exactly the contrary: a religion with\nneither God nor the supernatural. His project had little success; he\neven accomplished a tour de force by uniting both believers and\nnon-believers against him. The many ridiculous details of Comte’s\nreligion made the task of his opponents even easier.  But this aspect\nof Comte’s thought deserves better than the discredit into which it\nhas fallen (Wernick 2000; de Lubac 1945). \nComte defines religion as ‘the state of complete harmony\npeculiar to human life […] when all the parts of Life are\nordered in their natural relations to each other’ (1851,\nv. 2, 8; E.,v. 2, 8).  Comte also defines religion as a\nconsensus, analogous to what health is for the body.  Religion has two\nfunctions, according to the point of view from which one considers\nexistence: in its moral function, religion should govern each\nindividual; in its political function, it should unite all\nindividuals. Religion also has three components, corresponding to the\nthreefold division of the cerebral table: doctrine, worship, and moral\nrule (discipline).  Comte’s discussion is mainly about the\nfirst two. If one considers the first to be related to faith and the\nsecond to love, their relation takes two forms: ‘Love comes\nfirst and leads us to the faith, so long as the growth is spontaneous;\nbut when it becomes systematic, then the belief is constructed in\norder to regulate the action of love’ (1852, v. 2, 152; E.,\nv. 2, 83). At first, Comte had followed the traditional order and\npresented doctrine before worship, but he soon gave priority to\nworship, and saw this change as a considerable step forward. \nIn the positivist religion, worship, doctrine and moral rule all have\nthe same object, namely Humanity, which must be loved, known, and\nserved. Already the General Conclusions of\nthe Course compared the concept of Humanity to that of God,\naffirming the moral superiority of the former. But only in 1847 does\nComte make the substitution explicitly; sociological synthesis comes\nto replace theological synthesis. Membership of Humanity is\nsociological, not biological. In order to belong to what is defined as\nthe continuous whole of convergent beings — Comte’s term for\n(mainly human) beings who tend to agree — one has to be worthy\nof it. All ‘producers of dung’ are excluded; conversely,\nanimals that have rendered important services can be\nincluded. Strictly speaking, it is to sociology that one should turn\nfor knowledge of the laws of the human order but, as the final science\nrecapitulates all others, it is the whole encyclopedic scale\n(échelle ; it is the result of the classification of\nsciences), that constitutes the doctrine of the new religion, which\nthereby becomes demonstrated and is no longer revealed or\ninspired. \nThe principal novelty of Comte’s religion therefore resides in\nworship, which is both private (taking place within the family) and\npublic. The positivists set up a whole system of prayers, hymns, and\nsacraments (Wright 1986). As these were all largely inspired by\nCatholic worship, it was said that it was ‘catholicism without\nChrist’, to which the positivists replied that it was\n‘catholicism plus science’. The best known and most\noriginal aspects of Comte’s religion are found in its public worship,\nand in the positivist liturgical calendar.  As Humanity consists more\nof dead than living beings, positivism designed a whole system of\ncommemorations, which were to develop the sense of Humanity’s\nhistorical continuity. Thus, the worship of Humanity takes is the\nworship of great men. Unlike the French revolutionary calendar, which\nfollowed the rhythm of the seasons, the positivist calendar takes its\ninspiration from history and pays homage to great men from all nations\nand all times. \nThe wish to maintain the distinction between temporal and spiritual\npowers led Comte and his followers to demand the separation of Church\nand State. It has been noticed less often, however, that the two forms\nof power stand in differing relations to space. The religious society\nis by its nature catholic, in the sense of universal, and therefore\nhas no boundaries other than those of the planet; the surface of a\nState meets different demands, which impose rather strict geographic\nlimits. The contrast between French political history and English\npolitical history, which was a common place in Comte’s time (see for\ninstance Tocqueville or Guizot; it is already present in Montesquieu\nand Voltaire) illustrates the point: there is no separation of Church\nand State in Great Britain, in that sense that the Queen is also the\nhead of the Anglican Church. Nevertheless, its main application is\nrelated to the issue: centralization against local powers, which is\nanother aspect of the spatial dimension of politics. Of the two\npolitical models constantly confronted in the\nCourse, Comte clearly prefers the French one. Its\ncharacteristic alliance of the monarchy with the people against the\naristocracy was accompanied by a centralization that the Revolution\ncontented itself with consolidating. One might therefore be led to\nbelieve that Comte was a partisan of centralized political (that is:\ntemporal) power, whereas the contrary was in fact the case, as he\nproposed to divide France into seventeen administrative regions, more\nor less equivalent to the old provinces (1851, v. 4, 421; Vernon\n1984). Centralization applies only to the spiritual power.  \nPositivism asserted very early its wish to construct a moral doctrine\nthat owes nothing to the supernatural. If we need a spiritual power,\nit is because social questions are quite often moral rather than\npolitical. The reforms of society must be made in a determined order:\none has to change ideas, then morals (les moeurs; the word is\ndifficult to translate: it is something like ways of acting,\nhabits, les us et coutumes), and only then institutions. But\nwith the System, the moral doctrine (ethics) changes status\nand becomes a science, whose task is to extend sociology in order to\ntake individual phenomena into account, in particular affective\nones. \nThe terms of the problem as well as its solution are given by a saying\nto be found in the margin of the cerebral table: “Act from\naffection and think in order to act” (1851, v. 1, 726; E.,\nv. 1, 594). The first part of this “systematic verse”\nis guaranteed by the dominance of the heart; but, among the ten\n“affective forces”, the first seven correspond to egoism,\nthe final three to altruism. The whole question is knowing which ones\nwould prevail, those of “personality” or those of\n“sociability”. While it is important to acknowledge the\ninnateness of the sympathetic instincts, one is forced to admit their\nnative weakness: the supremacy of the egoistic tendencies is so clear\nthat it is itself one of the most striking traits in our nature. The\ngreat human problem is to reverse the natural order and to teach\nourselves to live for others. \nThe solution consists in ‘regulating the inside through the\noutside’ and depends, as a consequence, on a good use of the\nmind. The only way in which altruism can win, is to ally itself with\nthe mind, to make it its servant and not its slave. The heart, without\nthe light of reason, is blind. Left to itself, affectivity is\ncharacterized by its inconsistency and instability. That is why the\ninside has to be regulated, that is, disciplined. And this task is\nassigned to the outside, because exterior reality is the best of\nregulators. Whatever its own defects may be, the order that science\ndiscloses in nature is, by its indifference to our desires, a source\nof discipline. The recognition of an unchanging external order thus\nbecomes ‘the objective base of true human wisdom’, and\n‘in the obligation to conform themselves to it’ our\naffections find ‘a source of fixedness appropriate for\ncontrolling their spontaneous capriciousness, and a direct stimulation\nto the dominance of the sympathetic instincts’ (1851, v. 1,\n322; E., v. 1, 257). Science now finds itself vested with a moral\nfunction; but that also means that ‘thoughts must be\nsystematized before feelings’ (1851, v. 1, 21; E.,\nv. 1, 17) and that, if moral ascendancy is the primary attribute\nof the spiritual power, that power would not be able to carry out its\nduties without the aid of a superior intellect. \nWhile developing a science of morals founded on moral doctrine,\nDurkheim and Lévy-Bruhl were heavily dependent upon this aspect\nof the System. Like the word ‘sociology’, the\nword ‘altruism’ was coined by Comte. Being deeply aware of\nwhat man and animals have in common, Comte was close to what is known\ntoday as ‘evolutionary ethics’: he saw cooperation between\nmen as continuous with phenomena of which biology gives us further\nexamples. The same interest in biology led him to link medicine to\nmoral doctrine and even to religion. In our modern societies, the\nstudy of the human being ‘is now irrationally parcelled out\namongst three classes of thinkers: the Physicians, who study only the\nbody; the Philosophers, who imagine to study the mind; and the\nPriests, who specially study the heart’ (1852, v. 2, 437;\nE., v. 2, 356). To remedy this and to respect the unity of our\nnature, he proposed giving the new clergy a role in medicine,\nconsidering for example that there is no better endorsement of a rule\nof hygiene than a religious decree. Before dying, he still had the\ntime to outline, in his letters to Audiffrent, the rudiments of a\nsociological theory of diseases. \nAfter his death, Comte’s influence depended more on dissident\nfollowers than on orthodox positivists such as Pierre Lafitte in\nFrance and Richard Congreve and Frederic Harrison in England. \nOn the whole, the System was not well received.  Almost\nimmediately, Mill and Littré put forward the idea that there\nwere a good Comte, the author of the Course, and a bad Comte,\nthe author of the System.  However, it is impossible to\nconfine oneself merely to the Course. The early works had\nmade a strong impression on some of the best minds of the time; they\nremain required reading for everyone wishing to understand positive\nphilosophy, as they are still among the best introductions to the\nsubject. The Course was not part of the initial project,\nwhich Comte never lost sight of; the work is best considered as a\nparenthesis, admittedly open for twenty years, but which Comte had\nmeant to close very quickly. The reason why Comte had always presented\nthe Plan of 1822 as fundamental is that, beginning with the\nvery title, one finds the two themes that he planned to think through\nin their relation to one another: science and society. The foremost\nquestion is a political one: how should society be reorganized?\nScience, although present from the beginning, plays a secondary role\nas the means to achieve the chosen goal. All of Comte’s work aims at\nthe foundation of a discipline in which the study of society will\nfinally become positive, scientific. His idea of sociology is not\nquite the one we are used to today; but the current meaning of the\nterm ‘positivism’, according to which it is merely a\nphilosophy of science, is even more misleading as a clue to Comte’s\nthought. Even though the founder of positivism is rightly considered\nto be one of the great philosophers of science, along with\nPoincaré and Carnap, his natural place is elsewhere, along with\nsociologists such as his contemporaries Marx and Tocqueville. Only\nwhen the question arises of what distinguishes Comte from the latter\ndoes science enter into the picture. \nThe limits of Comte’s philosophy of science are easily seen, but this\ndoes not diminish their value, which remains considerable. Yet the\nsame cannot be said of the positive polity. Given that the separation\nof spiritual power and temporal power rests on the separation between\ntheory and practice, Comte abstained from any direct political action,\nand, for example, condemned Mill’s decision to stand in\nparliament. But his own project for the reorganization of society\npresents a similar problem. In his writings, it is difficult to\ndistinguish that which concerns objective social science from a reform\nprogram that reflects only a personal stand. \nApart from that difficulty, the weaknesses of the positive polity are\nnumerous. Among them, those that are the most conspicuous (criticism\nof human rights, praise of dictatorship) are not necessarily the most\nserious, for objections to the former are easily answered. For\nexample, while Comte criticizes freedom of conscience, he is always\nhighly supportive of freedom of expression. We should also find his\ndeep respect for spontaneity reassuring, considering that it is an\nimportant part of our idea of freedom. More serious, perhaps, seem to\nbe the consequences of the rejection of psychology. The moral\nquestion, ‘What should I do?’, is no longer asked in the\nfirst person, and is transformed into an engineering problem:\n‘What should be done to make men more ethical?’ Similarly,\nthe positivists were invited to live openly, whereby the distinction\nbetween private and public lives disappears. \nHowever, considering only the weaknesses of the positive polity would\nnot be fair. Even if Comte was often mistaken, his theory of\nconsensus, as well as the seriousness with which he considered the\nquestion ‘What religion after the death of God?’ (to give\nbut two examples) are likely to help us resolve certain problems\nconfronting our society. Comte’s thought is resolutely oriented toward\nthe future. The order of time, he said, is not past-present-future,\nbut rather past-future-present. The latter, being only ‘a vague\nand fleeting span which fills the interval between two immensities of\nduration, and binds them together […], can only be properly\nconceived with the aid of the two extremes which it unites and\nseparates’ (1851, v. 2, 364; E., v. 2, 296). He who\nwrote ‘from out of an anticipated grave’ (1857, ix)\nconcluded that positive utopias were useful (De Boni 1997). Various\nsigns lead one to think that, in the near future, we will witness a\nbetter reception of this aspect of Comte’s philosophy.","contact.mail":"Michel.Bourdeau@ehess.fr","contact.domain":"ehess.fr"}]
