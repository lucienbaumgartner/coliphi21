Perhaps the most important notion in pragmatics is Grice's\n(1967) conversational implicature. It is based on the\ninsight that by means of general principles of rational cooperative behavior\nwe can communicate more with the use of a sentence than the\nconventional semantic meaning associated with it. Grice has argued,\nfor instance, that the exclusive interpretation of\n‘or’—according to which we infer from ‘John or Mary\ncame’ that John and Mary didn't come both—is not due to the\nsemantic meaning of ‘or’ but should be accounted for by a theory\nof conversational implicature. In this particular example,—a typical\nexample of a so-called Quantity implicature—the hearer's implication is\ntaken to follow from the fact that the speaker could have used a contrasting,\nand informatively stronger expression, but chose not to. Other implicatures\nmay follow from what the  hearer thinks that the speaker takes to be normal\nstates of affairs, i.e., stereotypical interpretations. For both types of\nimplicatures, the hearer's (pragmatic) interpretation of an expression\ninvolves what he takes to be the speaker's reason for using this expression.\nBut obviously, this speaker's reason must involve assumptions about the\nhearer's reasoning as well.\n\n\n\nIn this entry we will discuss formal accounts of conversational implicatures\nthat explicitly take into account the interactive reasoning of speaker and\nhearer (e.g., what speaker and hearer believe about each other, the relevant\naspects of the context of utterance etc.) and that aim to reductively explain\nconversational implicature as the result of goal-oriented, economically\noptimized language use.\n\n\n\nOptimality Theory (OT) is a linguistic theory which assumes that linguistic\nchoices are governed by competition between a set of candidates, or\nalternatives. In standard OT (Prince & Smolensky, 1993) the optimal\ncandidate is the one that satisfies best a set of violable constraints. After\nits success in phonology, OT has also been used in syntax, semantics and\npragmatics. The original idea of optimality-theoretic semantics was to model\ninterpretation by taking the candidates to be the alternative interpretations\nthat the hearer could assign to a given expression, with constraints\ndescribing general preferences over expression-interpretation pairs. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) extended this original version by taking also alternative\nexpressions, or forms, into account that the speaker could have used,\nbut did not. The reference to alternative expressions/forms is standard in\npragmatics to account for Quantity implicatures. Optimization should thus be\nthought of from two directions: that of the hearer, and that of the speaker.\nWhat is optimal, according to Blutner's Bidirectional-OT (Bi-OT), is not just\ninterpretations with respect to forms, but rather form-interpretation pairs.\nIn terms of a ‘better than’ relation ‘>’ between\nform-interpretation pairs, the pair 〈f,i〉  is\nsaid to be (strongly) optimal iff it satisfies the following two\nconditions:  \n\nThe first condition requires that i is an optimal interpretation of\nform f. In Bi-OT this condition is thought of as optimization from\nthe hearer's point of view. Blutner proposed that\n〈f,i′〉 >\n〈f,i〉  iff i′ is a more likely, or\nstereotypical, interpretation of f than i is:  P(i′ | ⟦ f ⟧)\n>  P(i | ⟦ f \n⟧)  (where ⟦ f ⟧  denotes the\nsemantic meaning of f, and\nP(B | A) the conditional probability\nof B given A, defined as\nP(A∩B)/P(A)). The second\ncondition is taken to involve speaker's optimization: \nfor\n 〈f,i〉\n to be optimal for the speaker, it has to be the case that she cannot\nuse a more optimal form f ′ to express\ni.\n 〈f ′,i〉\n >\n 〈f,i〉\n iff either (i)\n P(i | ⟦f ′⟧)\n >\n P(i | ⟦ f ⟧),\n or (ii)\n P(i | ⟦f ′⟧)\n =\n P(i | ⟦ f ⟧)\n and f ′ is a less complex form to express\ni than f is.\n\n \n\nBi-OT accounts for classical Quantity implicatures. A convenient (though\ncontroversial) example is the ‘exactly’-interpretation of number\nterms. Let us assume, for the sake of example, that number terms semantically\nhave an ‘at least’-meaning.[1] Still, we want to account for the intuition that\nthe sentence “Three children came to the party” is normally\ninterpreted as saying that exactly three children came to the party.\nOne way to do this is to assume that the alternative expressions that the\nspeaker could use are of the form “(At least) n\nchildren came to the party”, while the alternative interpretations for\nthe hearer are of type in meaning that\n“Exactly n children came to the \nparty”.[2]\nIf we assume, again for the sake of example, that all relevant\ninterpretations are considered equally likely and that it is already\ncommonly assumed that some children came, but not more than four, the\nstrongly optimal form-interpretation pairs can be read off the\nfollowing table: \n\nIn this table the entry\n P(i3 | ⟦‘two’⟧) =\n 1⁄3 because\n P(i3 | {i2,i3,i4})\n = 1⁄3. Notice that according to this\nreasoning ‘two’ is interpreted as ‘exactly 2’\n(as indicated by an arrow) because (i)\n P(i2 | ⟦‘two’⟧)\n = 1⁄3 is higher than\n P(i2 | ⟦‘n’⟧)\n for any alternative expression ‘n’, and (ii) all\nother interpretations compatible with the semantic meaning of the\nnumeral expression are blocked: there is, for instance,\nanother expression for which i4 is a better\ninterpretation, i.e., an interpretation with a higher conditional\nprobability. \n\nWith numeral terms, the semantic meanings of the alternative expressions\ngive rise to a linear order. This turns out to be crucial for the Bi-OT\nanalysis, if we continue to take the interpretations as specific as we have\ndone so far. Consider the following alternative answers to the question\n“Who came to the party?”: \n\nSuppose that John and Bill are the only relevant persons and that it is\npresupposed that somebody came to the party. In that case the table that\nillustrates bidirectional optimality reasoning looks as follows (where\nix is the interpretation that only x\ncame): \n\nThis table correctly predicts that (1) is interpreted as saying that\nonly John came. But now consider the disjunction (2). Intuitively,\nthis answer should be interpreted as saying that either only John, or only\nBill came. It is easy to see, however, that this is predicted only if\n‘John came’ and ‘Bill came’ are not taken to be\nalternative forms. Bi-OT predicts that in case also ‘John came’\nand ‘Bill came’ are taken to be alternatives, the disjunction is\nuninterpretable, because the specific interpretations\nij, ib, and\nijb all can be expressed better by other forms.\nIn general, one can see that in case the semantic meanings of the alternative\nexpressions are not linearly, but only partially ordered, the derivation of\nQuantity implicatures sketched above gives rise to partially wrong\npredictions. \n\nAs it turns out, this problem for Bi-OT seems larger than it really is.\nIntuitively, an answer like (2) suggests that the speaker has incomplete\ninformation (she doesn't know who of John or Bill came). But the\ninterpretations that we considered so far are world states that do not encode\ndifferent amounts of speaker knowledge. So, to take this into account in Bi-OT\n(or in any other analysis of Quantity implicatures) we should allow for\nalternative interpretations that represent different knowledge states of the\nspeaker. Aloni (2007) gives a Bi-OT account of ignorance implicatures\n(inferences, like the above, that the speaker lacks certain bits of possibly\nrelevant information), alongside indifference implicatures (that the\nspeaker does not consider bits of information relevant enough to convey).\nMoreover, it can be shown that, as far as ignorance implicatures are\nconcerned, the predictions of Bi-OT line up with the pragmatic interpretation\nfunction called ‘Grice’ in various (joint) papers of\nSchulz and Van Rooij (e.g. Schulz & Van Rooij, 2006). In these papers it\nis claimed that Grice implements the Gricean maxim of Quality and the\nfirst maxim of Quantity, and it is shown that in terms of it (together with an\nadditional assumption of competence) we can account for many conversational\nimplicatures, including the ones of (1) and (2). \n\nBi-OT can also account for Horn's division of pragmatic labor\nor M-implicatures, as they are alternatively sometimes called\nafter Levinson (2000)—according to which an (un)marked\nexpression (morphologically complex and less lexicalized) typically\ngets an (un)marked interpretation—which Horn (1984) claimed to\nfollow from the interaction between both Gricean submaxims of\nQuantity, and the maxims of Relation and Manner.  To illustrate,\nconsider the following well-known example: \n\nWe typically interpret the unmarked (3) as meaning stereotypical\nkilling (on purpose), while the marked (4) suggests that John killed\nthe sheriff in a more indirect way, maybe unintentionally. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) shows that this can be accounted for in Bi-OT.  Take\nist to be the more plausible\ninterpretation where John killed the sheriff in the stereotypical way,\nwhile i¬st is the interpretation\nwhere John caused the sheriff's death in an unusual way. Because (3)\nis less complex than (4), and ist is the\nmore stereotypical interpretation compatible with the semantic meaning\nof (3), it is predicted that (3) is interpreted as\nist.  Thus, in terms of his notion of\nstrong optimality, i.e., optimality for both speaker and\nhearer, Blutner can account for the intuition that sentences typically\nget the most plausible, or stereotypical, interpretation. In terms of\nthis notion of optimality, however, Blutner is not able yet to explain\nhow the more complex form (4) can have an interpretation at all, in\nparticular, why it will be interpreted as non-stereotypical killing.\nThe reason is that on the assumption that (4) has the same semantic\nmeaning as (3), the stereotypical interpretation would be\nhearer-optimal not only for (3), but also for (4). \n\nTo account for the intuition that (4) is interpreted in a\nnon-stereotypical way, Blutner (2000) introduces a weaker notion of\noptimality that also takes into account a notion of blocking:\none form's pragmatically assigned meaning can take away, so to speak,\nthat meaning from another, less favorable form.  In the present case,\nthe stereotypical interpretation is intuitively blocked for the\ncumbersome form (4) by the cheaper alternative expression\n(3). Formally, a form-interpretation pair\n〈f,i〉 is weakly\n optimal[3]\n iff there is neither a strongly optimal\n〈f,i′〉 such that\n〈f,i′〉 >\n〈f,i〉 nor a strongly optimal\n〈f ′,i〉 such that\n〈f ′,i〉 >\n〈f,i〉.  All form-interpretation pairs that\nare strongly optimal are also weakly optimal.  However, a pair that is\nnot strongly optimal like\n〈(4),i¬st〉 can still be\nweakly optimal: since neither\n〈(4),ist〉 nor\n〈(3),i¬st〉 is strongly\noptimal, there is no objection for\n〈(4),i¬st〉 to be a (weakly)\noptimal pair. As a result, the marked (4) will get the\non-stereotypical interpretation. In general, application of the above\ndefinition of weak optimality can be difficult, but Jäger (2002)\ngives a concise algorithm for computing weakly optimal\nform-interpretation pairs. \n\nDavid Lewis (1969) introduced signaling games to explain how messages can\nbe used to communicate something, although these messages do not have a\npre-existing meaning. In pragmatics we want to do something similar:\nexplain what is actually communicated by an expression whose actual\ninterpretation is underspecified by its conventional semantic meaning. It\nis therefore a natural idea to base pragmatics on Lewisian signaling games. \n\nA signaling game is a game of asymmetric information between a sender\ns and a receiver r. The sender observes the state\nt that s and r are in, while the receiver\nhas to perform an action. Sender s can try to influence the\naction taken by r by sending a message.  T is the\nset of states, F the set of forms, or messages. We assume\nthat the messages already have a semantic meaning, given by the\nsemantic interpretation function ⟦·⟧ which\nassigns to each form a subset of T.  The sender will send a\nmessage/form in each state, a sender strategy S is\nthus a function from T to F. The receiver will\nperform an action after hearing a message with a particular semantic\nmeaning, but for present purposes we can think of actions simply as\ninterpretations. A receiver strategy R is then a\nfunction that maps a message to an interpretation, i.e., a subset of\nT. A utility function for speaker and hearer\nrepresents what interlocutors care about, and so the utility function\nmodels what speaker and hearer consider to be relevant information\n(implementing Grice's Maxim of Relevance). For simplicity, we assume\nthat the utility functions of s and r\n(Us and Ur) are the same\n(implementing Grice's cooperative principle), and that they depend on\n(i) the actual state t, (ii) the receiver's interpretation,\ni, of the message f sent by s in t\naccording to their respective strategies R and S,\ni.e., i = R(S(t)), and (iii) (in\nsection 2.3) the form f = S(t) used by the\nsender.  We assume that Nature picks the state according to some\n(commonly known) probability distribution P over T.\nWith respect to this probability function, we can determine the\nexpected, or average, utility of each sender-receiver strategy\ncombination 〈S,R〉 for player e\n∈ {s,r} as follows: \n\nA signaling game is then a (simplified, abstract) model of a single\nutterance and its interpretation, which includes some of the arguably\nmost relevant features of a context for pragmatic reasoning: an\nasymmetry of information (speaker knows the world state, hearer does\nnot), a notion of utterance alternatives (in the set of\nmessages/forms) with associated semantic meaning, and a flexible\nrepresentation of what counts of relevant information (via utility\nfunctions). If this is not enough, e.g., if we want the listener to\nhave partial information not shared by the speaker as well (such as\nwhen the speaker is uncertain about what is really relevant for the\nlistener), that can easily be accommodated into a more complex game\nmodel, but we refrain from going more complex here. The strategies of\nsender and receiver encode particular ways of using and interpreting\nlanguage. The notion of expected utility evaluates how good ways of\nusing and interpreting language are (in the given\ncontext). Game-theoretic explanations of pragmatic phenomena aim to\nsingle out those sender-receiver strategy pairs that correspond to\nempirically attested behavior as optimal and/or rational solution of\nthe game problem. \n\nThe standard solution concept of game theory is Nash\nequilibrium. A Nash equilibrium of a signaling game is a pair of\nstrategies 〈S*,R*〉\nwhich has the property that neither the sender nor the receiver could\nincrease his or her expected utility by unilateral deviation. Thus,\nS* is a best response to R*\nand R* is a best response to\nS*. There are plenty of refinements of Nash\nequilibrium in the game-theoretic literature. Moreover, there are\nalternatives to equilibrium analyses, the two most prominent of which\nare: (i) explicit formalizations of agents' reasoning processes, such\nas is done in epistemic game theory (e.g., Perea 2012), and (ii)\nvariants of evolutionary game theory (e.g., Sandholm 2010) that study\nthe dynamic changes in agents' behavioral disposition under gradual\noptimization procedures, such as by imitation or learning from\nparents. These issues are relevant for applications to linguistic\npragmatics as well, as we will demonstrate presently with the example\nof M-implicatures/Horn's division of pragmatic labor. \n\nWe would like to account for the meaning difference between (3) and\n(4), as before in the context of Bi-OT. Suppose we have 2 states,\ntst and t¬st, and\n2 messages, fu and\nfm. As before, the semantic meaning of\nboth messages is\n{tst,t¬st}, but\ntst is more stereotypical, or probable,\nthan t¬st:\nP(tst) >\nP(t¬st). We decompose the sender's\nutility function into a benefit and a cost function,\nUs(t,f,i) =\nBs(t,i) −\nC(f), where i is an interpretation. We\nadopt the following benefit function:\nBs(t,i) = 1 if\ni = t, and\nBs(t,i) = 0\notherwise. The cost of the unmarked message\nfu is lower than the cost of the marked\nmessage fm. We can assume without loss of\ngenerality that C(fu) = 0 <\nC(fm). We also assume that it is\nalways better to have successful communication with a costly message\nthan unsuccessful communication with a cheap message, which means that\nC(fm), though greater than\nC(fu), must remain reasonably\nsmall.  The sender and receiver strategies are as before. The\ncombination of sender and receiver strategies that gives rise to the\nbijective mapping\n{〈tst,fu〉,\n〈t¬st,fm〉}\nis a Nash equilibrium of this game. And this equilibrium encodes\nHorn's division of pragmatic labor: the unmarked (and lighter) message\nfu expresses the stereotypical\ninterpretation tst, while the\nnon-stereotypical state t¬st is expressed by\nthe marked and costlier message\nfm. Unfortunately, also the mapping\n{〈tst,fm〉,\n〈t¬st,fu〉}\n—where the lighter message denotes the non-stereotypical\nsituation—is a Nash equilibrium of the game, which means that on\nthe present implementation the standard solution concept of game\ntheory cannot yet single out the desired outcome. \n\nThis is were considerations of equilibrium refinements and/or alternative\nsolution concepts come in. For example, Parikh (1991, 2001) argues that we\nshould use an equilibrium refinement. He observes that, of the two equilibria\nmentioned above, the first one Pareto-dominates the second, and that for this\nreason the former should be preferred. Van Rooij (2004) suggests that because\nHorn's division of pragmatic labor involves not only language use but also\nlanguage organization, one should look at signaling games from an evolutionary\npoint of view, and make use of those variants of evolutionary game theory that\nexplain the emergence of Pareto-optimal solutions. As a third alternative,\nfollowing some ideas of De Jaegher (2008), van Rooij (2008) proposes that one\ncould also make use of forward induction (a particular game-theoretic way of\nreasoning about surprising moves of the opponent) to single out the desired\nequilibrium. As an example of an approach that draws on detailed modelling of\nthe epistemic states of interlocutors, Franke (2014a) suggests that we should\ndistinguish cases of M-implicature that involve rather clear ad hoc\nreasoning, such as (5) and (6), from cases with a possibly more\ngrammaticalized contrast, such as between (3) and (4).\n Franke suggests that the game model for reasoning about (5) and (6)\nshould contain an element of asymmetry of alternatives: whereas it is\nreasonable (for a speaker to expect that) a listener would consider\n(5) to be an alternative utterance when hearing (6), it is quite\nimplausible that (a speaker believes that) a listener will consider\n(6) a potential alternative utterance when hearing (5). This asymmetry\nof alternatives translates into different beliefs that the listener\nwill have about the context after different messages. The speaker can\nanticipate this, and a listener who has actually observed (6) can\nreason about his own counterfactual context representation that he\nwould have had if the speaker had said (5) instead. Franke shows that,\nwhen paired with this asymmetry in context representation, a simple\nmodel of iterated best response reasoning, to which we turn next,\ngives the desired result as well. \n\nUnlike the case of M-implicatures, many Quantity implicatures hinge on the\nfact that alternative expressions differ with respect to logical strength: the\ninference from ‘three’ to the pragmatically strengthed\n‘exactly three’-reading, that we sketched in Section 1.1, draws on\nthe fact that the alternative expression ‘four’ is semantically\nstronger, i.e., ‘four’ semantically entails\n‘three’, but not the other way around, under the assumed ‘at\nleast’-semantics. In order to bring considerations of semantic strength\nto bear on game-theoretic pragmatics, we must assign conventional meaning some\nrole in either the game model or the solution concept. In the following, we\nlook at two similar, but distinct possibilities of treating semantic meaning\nin approaches that spell out pragmatic reasoning as chains of (higher-order)\nreasoning about interlocutors' rationality.  \n\nA straightforward and efficient way of bringing semantic meaning into\ngame-theoretic pragmatics is to simply restrict the set of viable\nstrategies of sender and receiver in a signaling game to those\nstrategies that conform to conventional meaning: a sender can only\nselect forms that are true of the actual state, and the receiver can\nonly select interpretations which are in the denotation of an observed\nmessage. This may seem crude and excludes cases of non-literal\nlanguage use, lying, cheating and error from the start, but it may\nserve to rationalize common patterns of pragmatic reasoning among\ncooperative, information-seeking interlocutors. Based on such a\nrestriction to truth-obedient strategies, it has been shown\nindependently by Pavan (2013) and Rothschild (2013) that there is an\nestablished non-equilibrium solution concept that nicely rationalizes\nQuantity implicatures, namely iterated admissibility, also\nknown as iterated elimination of weakly dominated\nstrategies. Without going into detail, the general idea of this\nsolution concept is to start with the whole set of viable strategies\n(all conforming to semantic meaning) and then to iteratively eliminate\nall strategies X for which there is no cautious\nbelief about which of the opponent's remaining strategies the\nopponent will likely play that would make X a rational thing\nto do. (A cautious belief is one that does not exclude any opponent\nstrategy that has not been eliminated so far.) The set of strategies\nthat survive repeated iterations of elimination are then compatible\nwith (a particular kind of) common belief in rationality. In sum,\niterated admissibility is an eliminative approach: starting from the\nset of all (truth-abiding) strategies, some strategies are weeded out\nat every step until we remain with a stable set of strategies from\nwhich nothing can be eliminated anymore. \n\nAn alternative to restricting attention to only truthful strategies is\nto use semantic meaning to constrain the starting point of pragmatic\nreasoning.  Approaches that do so are the optimal assertions\napproach (Benz 2006, Benz & van Rooij 2007), iterated\nbest response models (e.g., Franke 2009, 2011, Jäger 2014),\nand related probabilistic models (e.g., Frank & Goodman\n2012, Goodman & Stuhlmüller 2013, Franke & Jäger\n2014). The general idea that unifies these approaches can be traced\ndirectly to Grice, in particular the notion that speaker's should\nmaximize the amount of relevant information contained in their\nutterances. Since information contained in an utterance is standardly\ntaken to be semantic information (as opposed to pragmatically\nrestricted or modulated meaning), a simple way of implementing Gricean\nspeakers is to assume that they choose utterances by considering how a\nliteral interpreter would react to each alternative. Pragmatic\nlisteners then react optimally based on the belief that the speaker is\nGricean in the above sense. In other words, these approaches define a\nreasoning scheme of higher-order rational reasoning: starting with a\n(non-rational, dummy) literal interpreter, a Gricean speaker acts\n(approximately) rationally based on literal interpretation, while a\nGricean listener interpret (approximately) rationally based on the\nbehavior of a Gricean speaker. Some contributions allow for\nhigher-order iterations of best responses, others do not; some\ncontributions also look at reasoning sequences that start with literal\nsenders; some contributions assume that agents are strictly rational,\nothers allow for probabilistic approximations to classical rational\nchoice (see Franke & Jäger 2014 for overview and comparison). \n\nA crucial difference between iterated best response approaches and the\npreviously mentioned approach based on iterated admissibility is that\nthe former does not shrink a set of strategies but allows for a\ndifferent set of best responses at each step. This also makes it so\nthat (some) iterated best response approaches can deal with pragmatic\nreasoning in cases where interlocutors' preferences are not aligned,\ni.e., where the Gricean assumption of cooperativity does not hold, or\nwhere there are additional incentives to deviate from semantic meaning\n(for more about game models for reasoning in non-cooperative contexts,\nsee, e.g., Franke, de Jager & van Rooij 2012, de Jaegher & van\nRooij 2014). Another difference between iterated best response models\nand iterated admissibility is that the latter do not by itself account\nfor Horn's division of pragmatic labor (see Franke 2014b and Pavan\n2014 for discussion).  To illustrate how iterated best response reasoning works in a simple\n(cooperative) case, let us look briefly at numerical expressions again. Take a\nsignaling game with 4 states, or worlds, W = {w1,\nw2, w3, w4} where\nthe indices give the exact/maximal number of children that came to our party,\nand four messages F =\n{‘one’,‘two’,‘three’, ‘four’},\nas shorthand for ‘n children came to our party’. On a\nneo-Gricean ‘at least’-interpretation of numerals, the meanings of\nthe numeral expressions form an implication chain:\n⟦‘four’⟧ ⊂ ⟦‘three’⟧\n⊂ ⟦‘two’⟧ ⊂\n⟦‘one’⟧, because, for instance,\n⟦‘three’⟧ = {w3,\nw4}. A literal interpreter, who is otherwise oblivious to\ncontextual factors, would respond to every message by choosing any true\ninterpretation with equal probability. So, for instance, if the literal\ninterpreter hears ‘three’, he would choose w3\nor w4, each with probability ½. But that means that\nan optimal choice of expression for a speaker who wants to communicate that\nthe actual world is w3 would be ‘three’,\nbecause this maximizes the chance that the literal interpreter selects\nw3. Concretely, if the speaker chooses ‘one’,\nthe chance that the literal listener chooses w3 is\n¼; for ‘two’ it's &frac13;; for ‘three’ it's\n½, and for ‘four’ it's zero, because w3\nis not an element of ⟦‘three’⟧. So, a rational\nGricean speaker selects ⟦‘three’⟧ in\nw3 and nowhere else, as is easy to see by a parallel\nargument for all other states. But that means that a Gricean interpreter who\nhears ‘three’ will infer that the actual world must be\nw3. \n\nA particularly promising recent expansion of this pragmatic reasoning\nscheme is to include probabilistic choice functions to model agents'\napproximately rational choices, so as to allow for a much more direct\nlink with experimental data (cf., Franke & Jäger 2016 for\noverview). Such probabilistic pragmatic models have been applied to a\nnumber of phenomena of interest, including reasoning about referential\nexpressions in context (Frank & Goodman 2012), ignorance\nimplicatures (Goodman & Stuhlmüller 2013), non-literal\ninterpretation of number terms (Kao et al. 2014), or Quantity\nimplicatures in complex sentences (Potts et al. to appear). \n\nBidirectional Optimality Theory and Game Theory are quite natural, and\nsimilar, frameworks to formalize Gricean ideas about interactive,\ngoal-oriented pragmatic reasoning in context. Recent developments turn\ntowards epistemic or evolutionary game theory or to probabilistic\nmodels for empirical data.","contact.mail":"R.A.M.vanRooij@uva.nl","contact.domain":"uva.nl"},{"date.published":"2006-12-01","date.changed":"2015-11-09","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature-optimality-games/","author1":"Robert van Rooij","author2":"Michael Franke","entry":"implicature-optimality-games","body.text":"\n\n\n\nLinguistic pragmatics studies the context-dependent use and interpretation of\nexpressions.  Perhaps the most important notion in pragmatics is Grice's\n(1967) conversational implicature. It is based on the\ninsight that by means of general principles of rational cooperative behavior\nwe can communicate more with the use of a sentence than the\nconventional semantic meaning associated with it. Grice has argued,\nfor instance, that the exclusive interpretation of\n‘or’—according to which we infer from ‘John or Mary\ncame’ that John and Mary didn't come both—is not due to the\nsemantic meaning of ‘or’ but should be accounted for by a theory\nof conversational implicature. In this particular example,—a typical\nexample of a so-called Quantity implicature—the hearer's implication is\ntaken to follow from the fact that the speaker could have used a contrasting,\nand informatively stronger expression, but chose not to. Other implicatures\nmay follow from what the  hearer thinks that the speaker takes to be normal\nstates of affairs, i.e., stereotypical interpretations. For both types of\nimplicatures, the hearer's (pragmatic) interpretation of an expression\ninvolves what he takes to be the speaker's reason for using this expression.\nBut obviously, this speaker's reason must involve assumptions about the\nhearer's reasoning as well.\n\n\n\nIn this entry we will discuss formal accounts of conversational implicatures\nthat explicitly take into account the interactive reasoning of speaker and\nhearer (e.g., what speaker and hearer believe about each other, the relevant\naspects of the context of utterance etc.) and that aim to reductively explain\nconversational implicature as the result of goal-oriented, economically\noptimized language use.\n\n\n\nOptimality Theory (OT) is a linguistic theory which assumes that linguistic\nchoices are governed by competition between a set of candidates, or\nalternatives. In standard OT (Prince & Smolensky, 1993) the optimal\ncandidate is the one that satisfies best a set of violable constraints. After\nits success in phonology, OT has also been used in syntax, semantics and\npragmatics. The original idea of optimality-theoretic semantics was to model\ninterpretation by taking the candidates to be the alternative interpretations\nthat the hearer could assign to a given expression, with constraints\ndescribing general preferences over expression-interpretation pairs. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) extended this original version by taking also alternative\nexpressions, or forms, into account that the speaker could have used,\nbut did not. The reference to alternative expressions/forms is standard in\npragmatics to account for Quantity implicatures. Optimization should thus be\nthought of from two directions: that of the hearer, and that of the speaker.\nWhat is optimal, according to Blutner's Bidirectional-OT (Bi-OT), is not just\ninterpretations with respect to forms, but rather form-interpretation pairs.\nIn terms of a ‘better than’ relation ‘>’ between\nform-interpretation pairs, the pair 〈f,i〉  is\nsaid to be (strongly) optimal iff it satisfies the following two\nconditions:  \n\nThe first condition requires that i is an optimal interpretation of\nform f. In Bi-OT this condition is thought of as optimization from\nthe hearer's point of view. Blutner proposed that\n〈f,i′〉 >\n〈f,i〉  iff i′ is a more likely, or\nstereotypical, interpretation of f than i is:  P(i′ | ⟦ f ⟧)\n>  P(i | ⟦ f \n⟧)  (where ⟦ f ⟧  denotes the\nsemantic meaning of f, and\nP(B | A) the conditional probability\nof B given A, defined as\nP(A∩B)/P(A)). The second\ncondition is taken to involve speaker's optimization: \nfor\n 〈f,i〉\n to be optimal for the speaker, it has to be the case that she cannot\nuse a more optimal form f ′ to express\ni.\n 〈f ′,i〉\n >\n 〈f,i〉\n iff either (i)\n P(i | ⟦f ′⟧)\n >\n P(i | ⟦ f ⟧),\n or (ii)\n P(i | ⟦f ′⟧)\n =\n P(i | ⟦ f ⟧)\n and f ′ is a less complex form to express\ni than f is.\n\n \n\nBi-OT accounts for classical Quantity implicatures. A convenient (though\ncontroversial) example is the ‘exactly’-interpretation of number\nterms. Let us assume, for the sake of example, that number terms semantically\nhave an ‘at least’-meaning.[1] Still, we want to account for the intuition that\nthe sentence “Three children came to the party” is normally\ninterpreted as saying that exactly three children came to the party.\nOne way to do this is to assume that the alternative expressions that the\nspeaker could use are of the form “(At least) n\nchildren came to the party”, while the alternative interpretations for\nthe hearer are of type in meaning that\n“Exactly n children came to the \nparty”.[2]\nIf we assume, again for the sake of example, that all relevant\ninterpretations are considered equally likely and that it is already\ncommonly assumed that some children came, but not more than four, the\nstrongly optimal form-interpretation pairs can be read off the\nfollowing table: \n\nIn this table the entry\n P(i3 | ⟦‘two’⟧) =\n 1⁄3 because\n P(i3 | {i2,i3,i4})\n = 1⁄3. Notice that according to this\nreasoning ‘two’ is interpreted as ‘exactly 2’\n(as indicated by an arrow) because (i)\n P(i2 | ⟦‘two’⟧)\n = 1⁄3 is higher than\n P(i2 | ⟦‘n’⟧)\n for any alternative expression ‘n’, and (ii) all\nother interpretations compatible with the semantic meaning of the\nnumeral expression are blocked: there is, for instance,\nanother expression for which i4 is a better\ninterpretation, i.e., an interpretation with a higher conditional\nprobability. \n\nWith numeral terms, the semantic meanings of the alternative expressions\ngive rise to a linear order. This turns out to be crucial for the Bi-OT\nanalysis, if we continue to take the interpretations as specific as we have\ndone so far. Consider the following alternative answers to the question\n“Who came to the party?”: \n\nSuppose that John and Bill are the only relevant persons and that it is\npresupposed that somebody came to the party. In that case the table that\nillustrates bidirectional optimality reasoning looks as follows (where\nix is the interpretation that only x\ncame): \n\nThis table correctly predicts that (1) is interpreted as saying that\nonly John came. But now consider the disjunction (2). Intuitively,\nthis answer should be interpreted as saying that either only John, or only\nBill came. It is easy to see, however, that this is predicted only if\n‘John came’ and ‘Bill came’ are not taken to be\nalternative forms. Bi-OT predicts that in case also ‘John came’\nand ‘Bill came’ are taken to be alternatives, the disjunction is\nuninterpretable, because the specific interpretations\nij, ib, and\nijb all can be expressed better by other forms.\nIn general, one can see that in case the semantic meanings of the alternative\nexpressions are not linearly, but only partially ordered, the derivation of\nQuantity implicatures sketched above gives rise to partially wrong\npredictions. \n\nAs it turns out, this problem for Bi-OT seems larger than it really is.\nIntuitively, an answer like (2) suggests that the speaker has incomplete\ninformation (she doesn't know who of John or Bill came). But the\ninterpretations that we considered so far are world states that do not encode\ndifferent amounts of speaker knowledge. So, to take this into account in Bi-OT\n(or in any other analysis of Quantity implicatures) we should allow for\nalternative interpretations that represent different knowledge states of the\nspeaker. Aloni (2007) gives a Bi-OT account of ignorance implicatures\n(inferences, like the above, that the speaker lacks certain bits of possibly\nrelevant information), alongside indifference implicatures (that the\nspeaker does not consider bits of information relevant enough to convey).\nMoreover, it can be shown that, as far as ignorance implicatures are\nconcerned, the predictions of Bi-OT line up with the pragmatic interpretation\nfunction called ‘Grice’ in various (joint) papers of\nSchulz and Van Rooij (e.g. Schulz & Van Rooij, 2006). In these papers it\nis claimed that Grice implements the Gricean maxim of Quality and the\nfirst maxim of Quantity, and it is shown that in terms of it (together with an\nadditional assumption of competence) we can account for many conversational\nimplicatures, including the ones of (1) and (2). \n\nBi-OT can also account for Horn's division of pragmatic labor\nor M-implicatures, as they are alternatively sometimes called\nafter Levinson (2000)—according to which an (un)marked\nexpression (morphologically complex and less lexicalized) typically\ngets an (un)marked interpretation—which Horn (1984) claimed to\nfollow from the interaction between both Gricean submaxims of\nQuantity, and the maxims of Relation and Manner.  To illustrate,\nconsider the following well-known example: \n\nWe typically interpret the unmarked (3) as meaning stereotypical\nkilling (on purpose), while the marked (4) suggests that John killed\nthe sheriff in a more indirect way, maybe unintentionally. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) shows that this can be accounted for in Bi-OT.  Take\nist to be the more plausible\ninterpretation where John killed the sheriff in the stereotypical way,\nwhile i¬st is the interpretation\nwhere John caused the sheriff's death in an unusual way. Because (3)\nis less complex than (4), and ist is the\nmore stereotypical interpretation compatible with the semantic meaning\nof (3), it is predicted that (3) is interpreted as\nist.  Thus, in terms of his notion of\nstrong optimality, i.e., optimality for both speaker and\nhearer, Blutner can account for the intuition that sentences typically\nget the most plausible, or stereotypical, interpretation. In terms of\nthis notion of optimality, however, Blutner is not able yet to explain\nhow the more complex form (4) can have an interpretation at all, in\nparticular, why it will be interpreted as non-stereotypical killing.\nThe reason is that on the assumption that (4) has the same semantic\nmeaning as (3), the stereotypical interpretation would be\nhearer-optimal not only for (3), but also for (4). \n\nTo account for the intuition that (4) is interpreted in a\nnon-stereotypical way, Blutner (2000) introduces a weaker notion of\noptimality that also takes into account a notion of blocking:\none form's pragmatically assigned meaning can take away, so to speak,\nthat meaning from another, less favorable form.  In the present case,\nthe stereotypical interpretation is intuitively blocked for the\ncumbersome form (4) by the cheaper alternative expression\n(3). Formally, a form-interpretation pair\n〈f,i〉 is weakly\n optimal[3]\n iff there is neither a strongly optimal\n〈f,i′〉 such that\n〈f,i′〉 >\n〈f,i〉 nor a strongly optimal\n〈f ′,i〉 such that\n〈f ′,i〉 >\n〈f,i〉.  All form-interpretation pairs that\nare strongly optimal are also weakly optimal.  However, a pair that is\nnot strongly optimal like\n〈(4),i¬st〉 can still be\nweakly optimal: since neither\n〈(4),ist〉 nor\n〈(3),i¬st〉 is strongly\noptimal, there is no objection for\n〈(4),i¬st〉 to be a (weakly)\noptimal pair. As a result, the marked (4) will get the\non-stereotypical interpretation. In general, application of the above\ndefinition of weak optimality can be difficult, but Jäger (2002)\ngives a concise algorithm for computing weakly optimal\nform-interpretation pairs. \n\nDavid Lewis (1969) introduced signaling games to explain how messages can\nbe used to communicate something, although these messages do not have a\npre-existing meaning. In pragmatics we want to do something similar:\nexplain what is actually communicated by an expression whose actual\ninterpretation is underspecified by its conventional semantic meaning. It\nis therefore a natural idea to base pragmatics on Lewisian signaling games. \n\nA signaling game is a game of asymmetric information between a sender\ns and a receiver r. The sender observes the state\nt that s and r are in, while the receiver\nhas to perform an action. Sender s can try to influence the\naction taken by r by sending a message.  T is the\nset of states, F the set of forms, or messages. We assume\nthat the messages already have a semantic meaning, given by the\nsemantic interpretation function ⟦·⟧ which\nassigns to each form a subset of T.  The sender will send a\nmessage/form in each state, a sender strategy S is\nthus a function from T to F. The receiver will\nperform an action after hearing a message with a particular semantic\nmeaning, but for present purposes we can think of actions simply as\ninterpretations. A receiver strategy R is then a\nfunction that maps a message to an interpretation, i.e., a subset of\nT. A utility function for speaker and hearer\nrepresents what interlocutors care about, and so the utility function\nmodels what speaker and hearer consider to be relevant information\n(implementing Grice's Maxim of Relevance). For simplicity, we assume\nthat the utility functions of s and r\n(Us and Ur) are the same\n(implementing Grice's cooperative principle), and that they depend on\n(i) the actual state t, (ii) the receiver's interpretation,\ni, of the message f sent by s in t\naccording to their respective strategies R and S,\ni.e., i = R(S(t)), and (iii) (in\nsection 2.3) the form f = S(t) used by the\nsender.  We assume that Nature picks the state according to some\n(commonly known) probability distribution P over T.\nWith respect to this probability function, we can determine the\nexpected, or average, utility of each sender-receiver strategy\ncombination 〈S,R〉 for player e\n∈ {s,r} as follows: \n\nA signaling game is then a (simplified, abstract) model of a single\nutterance and its interpretation, which includes some of the arguably\nmost relevant features of a context for pragmatic reasoning: an\nasymmetry of information (speaker knows the world state, hearer does\nnot), a notion of utterance alternatives (in the set of\nmessages/forms) with associated semantic meaning, and a flexible\nrepresentation of what counts of relevant information (via utility\nfunctions). If this is not enough, e.g., if we want the listener to\nhave partial information not shared by the speaker as well (such as\nwhen the speaker is uncertain about what is really relevant for the\nlistener), that can easily be accommodated into a more complex game\nmodel, but we refrain from going more complex here. The strategies of\nsender and receiver encode particular ways of using and interpreting\nlanguage. The notion of expected utility evaluates how good ways of\nusing and interpreting language are (in the given\ncontext). Game-theoretic explanations of pragmatic phenomena aim to\nsingle out those sender-receiver strategy pairs that correspond to\nempirically attested behavior as optimal and/or rational solution of\nthe game problem. \n\nThe standard solution concept of game theory is Nash\nequilibrium. A Nash equilibrium of a signaling game is a pair of\nstrategies 〈S*,R*〉\nwhich has the property that neither the sender nor the receiver could\nincrease his or her expected utility by unilateral deviation. Thus,\nS* is a best response to R*\nand R* is a best response to\nS*. There are plenty of refinements of Nash\nequilibrium in the game-theoretic literature. Moreover, there are\nalternatives to equilibrium analyses, the two most prominent of which\nare: (i) explicit formalizations of agents' reasoning processes, such\nas is done in epistemic game theory (e.g., Perea 2012), and (ii)\nvariants of evolutionary game theory (e.g., Sandholm 2010) that study\nthe dynamic changes in agents' behavioral disposition under gradual\noptimization procedures, such as by imitation or learning from\nparents. These issues are relevant for applications to linguistic\npragmatics as well, as we will demonstrate presently with the example\nof M-implicatures/Horn's division of pragmatic labor. \n\nWe would like to account for the meaning difference between (3) and\n(4), as before in the context of Bi-OT. Suppose we have 2 states,\ntst and t¬st, and\n2 messages, fu and\nfm. As before, the semantic meaning of\nboth messages is\n{tst,t¬st}, but\ntst is more stereotypical, or probable,\nthan t¬st:\nP(tst) >\nP(t¬st). We decompose the sender's\nutility function into a benefit and a cost function,\nUs(t,f,i) =\nBs(t,i) −\nC(f), where i is an interpretation. We\nadopt the following benefit function:\nBs(t,i) = 1 if\ni = t, and\nBs(t,i) = 0\notherwise. The cost of the unmarked message\nfu is lower than the cost of the marked\nmessage fm. We can assume without loss of\ngenerality that C(fu) = 0 <\nC(fm). We also assume that it is\nalways better to have successful communication with a costly message\nthan unsuccessful communication with a cheap message, which means that\nC(fm), though greater than\nC(fu), must remain reasonably\nsmall.  The sender and receiver strategies are as before. The\ncombination of sender and receiver strategies that gives rise to the\nbijective mapping\n{〈tst,fu〉,\n〈t¬st,fm〉}\nis a Nash equilibrium of this game. And this equilibrium encodes\nHorn's division of pragmatic labor: the unmarked (and lighter) message\nfu expresses the stereotypical\ninterpretation tst, while the\nnon-stereotypical state t¬st is expressed by\nthe marked and costlier message\nfm. Unfortunately, also the mapping\n{〈tst,fm〉,\n〈t¬st,fu〉}\n—where the lighter message denotes the non-stereotypical\nsituation—is a Nash equilibrium of the game, which means that on\nthe present implementation the standard solution concept of game\ntheory cannot yet single out the desired outcome. \n\nThis is were considerations of equilibrium refinements and/or alternative\nsolution concepts come in. For example, Parikh (1991, 2001) argues that we\nshould use an equilibrium refinement. He observes that, of the two equilibria\nmentioned above, the first one Pareto-dominates the second, and that for this\nreason the former should be preferred. Van Rooij (2004) suggests that because\nHorn's division of pragmatic labor involves not only language use but also\nlanguage organization, one should look at signaling games from an evolutionary\npoint of view, and make use of those variants of evolutionary game theory that\nexplain the emergence of Pareto-optimal solutions. As a third alternative,\nfollowing some ideas of De Jaegher (2008), van Rooij (2008) proposes that one\ncould also make use of forward induction (a particular game-theoretic way of\nreasoning about surprising moves of the opponent) to single out the desired\nequilibrium. As an example of an approach that draws on detailed modelling of\nthe epistemic states of interlocutors, Franke (2014a) suggests that we should\ndistinguish cases of M-implicature that involve rather clear ad hoc\nreasoning, such as (5) and (6), from cases with a possibly more\ngrammaticalized contrast, such as between (3) and (4).\n Franke suggests that the game model for reasoning about (5) and (6)\nshould contain an element of asymmetry of alternatives: whereas it is\nreasonable (for a speaker to expect that) a listener would consider\n(5) to be an alternative utterance when hearing (6), it is quite\nimplausible that (a speaker believes that) a listener will consider\n(6) a potential alternative utterance when hearing (5). This asymmetry\nof alternatives translates into different beliefs that the listener\nwill have about the context after different messages. The speaker can\nanticipate this, and a listener who has actually observed (6) can\nreason about his own counterfactual context representation that he\nwould have had if the speaker had said (5) instead. Franke shows that,\nwhen paired with this asymmetry in context representation, a simple\nmodel of iterated best response reasoning, to which we turn next,\ngives the desired result as well. \n\nUnlike the case of M-implicatures, many Quantity implicatures hinge on the\nfact that alternative expressions differ with respect to logical strength: the\ninference from ‘three’ to the pragmatically strengthed\n‘exactly three’-reading, that we sketched in Section 1.1, draws on\nthe fact that the alternative expression ‘four’ is semantically\nstronger, i.e., ‘four’ semantically entails\n‘three’, but not the other way around, under the assumed ‘at\nleast’-semantics. In order to bring considerations of semantic strength\nto bear on game-theoretic pragmatics, we must assign conventional meaning some\nrole in either the game model or the solution concept. In the following, we\nlook at two similar, but distinct possibilities of treating semantic meaning\nin approaches that spell out pragmatic reasoning as chains of (higher-order)\nreasoning about interlocutors' rationality.  \n\nA straightforward and efficient way of bringing semantic meaning into\ngame-theoretic pragmatics is to simply restrict the set of viable\nstrategies of sender and receiver in a signaling game to those\nstrategies that conform to conventional meaning: a sender can only\nselect forms that are true of the actual state, and the receiver can\nonly select interpretations which are in the denotation of an observed\nmessage. This may seem crude and excludes cases of non-literal\nlanguage use, lying, cheating and error from the start, but it may\nserve to rationalize common patterns of pragmatic reasoning among\ncooperative, information-seeking interlocutors. Based on such a\nrestriction to truth-obedient strategies, it has been shown\nindependently by Pavan (2013) and Rothschild (2013) that there is an\nestablished non-equilibrium solution concept that nicely rationalizes\nQuantity implicatures, namely iterated admissibility, also\nknown as iterated elimination of weakly dominated\nstrategies. Without going into detail, the general idea of this\nsolution concept is to start with the whole set of viable strategies\n(all conforming to semantic meaning) and then to iteratively eliminate\nall strategies X for which there is no cautious\nbelief about which of the opponent's remaining strategies the\nopponent will likely play that would make X a rational thing\nto do. (A cautious belief is one that does not exclude any opponent\nstrategy that has not been eliminated so far.) The set of strategies\nthat survive repeated iterations of elimination are then compatible\nwith (a particular kind of) common belief in rationality. In sum,\niterated admissibility is an eliminative approach: starting from the\nset of all (truth-abiding) strategies, some strategies are weeded out\nat every step until we remain with a stable set of strategies from\nwhich nothing can be eliminated anymore. \n\nAn alternative to restricting attention to only truthful strategies is\nto use semantic meaning to constrain the starting point of pragmatic\nreasoning.  Approaches that do so are the optimal assertions\napproach (Benz 2006, Benz & van Rooij 2007), iterated\nbest response models (e.g., Franke 2009, 2011, Jäger 2014),\nand related probabilistic models (e.g., Frank & Goodman\n2012, Goodman & Stuhlmüller 2013, Franke & Jäger\n2014). The general idea that unifies these approaches can be traced\ndirectly to Grice, in particular the notion that speaker's should\nmaximize the amount of relevant information contained in their\nutterances. Since information contained in an utterance is standardly\ntaken to be semantic information (as opposed to pragmatically\nrestricted or modulated meaning), a simple way of implementing Gricean\nspeakers is to assume that they choose utterances by considering how a\nliteral interpreter would react to each alternative. Pragmatic\nlisteners then react optimally based on the belief that the speaker is\nGricean in the above sense. In other words, these approaches define a\nreasoning scheme of higher-order rational reasoning: starting with a\n(non-rational, dummy) literal interpreter, a Gricean speaker acts\n(approximately) rationally based on literal interpretation, while a\nGricean listener interpret (approximately) rationally based on the\nbehavior of a Gricean speaker. Some contributions allow for\nhigher-order iterations of best responses, others do not; some\ncontributions also look at reasoning sequences that start with literal\nsenders; some contributions assume that agents are strictly rational,\nothers allow for probabilistic approximations to classical rational\nchoice (see Franke & Jäger 2014 for overview and comparison). \n\nA crucial difference between iterated best response approaches and the\npreviously mentioned approach based on iterated admissibility is that\nthe former does not shrink a set of strategies but allows for a\ndifferent set of best responses at each step. This also makes it so\nthat (some) iterated best response approaches can deal with pragmatic\nreasoning in cases where interlocutors' preferences are not aligned,\ni.e., where the Gricean assumption of cooperativity does not hold, or\nwhere there are additional incentives to deviate from semantic meaning\n(for more about game models for reasoning in non-cooperative contexts,\nsee, e.g., Franke, de Jager & van Rooij 2012, de Jaegher & van\nRooij 2014). Another difference between iterated best response models\nand iterated admissibility is that the latter do not by itself account\nfor Horn's division of pragmatic labor (see Franke 2014b and Pavan\n2014 for discussion).  To illustrate how iterated best response reasoning works in a simple\n(cooperative) case, let us look briefly at numerical expressions again. Take a\nsignaling game with 4 states, or worlds, W = {w1,\nw2, w3, w4} where\nthe indices give the exact/maximal number of children that came to our party,\nand four messages F =\n{‘one’,‘two’,‘three’, ‘four’},\nas shorthand for ‘n children came to our party’. On a\nneo-Gricean ‘at least’-interpretation of numerals, the meanings of\nthe numeral expressions form an implication chain:\n⟦‘four’⟧ ⊂ ⟦‘three’⟧\n⊂ ⟦‘two’⟧ ⊂\n⟦‘one’⟧, because, for instance,\n⟦‘three’⟧ = {w3,\nw4}. A literal interpreter, who is otherwise oblivious to\ncontextual factors, would respond to every message by choosing any true\ninterpretation with equal probability. So, for instance, if the literal\ninterpreter hears ‘three’, he would choose w3\nor w4, each with probability ½. But that means that\nan optimal choice of expression for a speaker who wants to communicate that\nthe actual world is w3 would be ‘three’,\nbecause this maximizes the chance that the literal interpreter selects\nw3. Concretely, if the speaker chooses ‘one’,\nthe chance that the literal listener chooses w3 is\n¼; for ‘two’ it's &frac13;; for ‘three’ it's\n½, and for ‘four’ it's zero, because w3\nis not an element of ⟦‘three’⟧. So, a rational\nGricean speaker selects ⟦‘three’⟧ in\nw3 and nowhere else, as is easy to see by a parallel\nargument for all other states. But that means that a Gricean interpreter who\nhears ‘three’ will infer that the actual world must be\nw3. \n\nA particularly promising recent expansion of this pragmatic reasoning\nscheme is to include probabilistic choice functions to model agents'\napproximately rational choices, so as to allow for a much more direct\nlink with experimental data (cf., Franke & Jäger 2016 for\noverview). Such probabilistic pragmatic models have been applied to a\nnumber of phenomena of interest, including reasoning about referential\nexpressions in context (Frank & Goodman 2012), ignorance\nimplicatures (Goodman & Stuhlmüller 2013), non-literal\ninterpretation of number terms (Kao et al. 2014), or Quantity\nimplicatures in complex sentences (Potts et al. to appear). \n\nBidirectional Optimality Theory and Game Theory are quite natural, and\nsimilar, frameworks to formalize Gricean ideas about interactive,\ngoal-oriented pragmatic reasoning in context. Recent developments turn\ntowards epistemic or evolutionary game theory or to probabilistic\nmodels for empirical data.","contact.mail":"mchfranke@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
