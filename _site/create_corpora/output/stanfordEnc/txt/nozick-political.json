Despite his highly acclaimed work in\nmany other fields of philosophy, Nozick remained best known for the\nlibertarian doctrine advanced in Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia.\n\nRobert Nozick was born in Brooklyn in 1938 to a Russian Jewish\nimmigrant family. He earned an undergraduate Philosophy degree from\nColumbia University in 1959 and a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton\nUniversity in 1963. He taught for a couple of years at Princeton,\nHarvard, and Rockefeller Universities before moving permanently to\nHarvard in 1969. He became widely known through his 1974\nbook, Anarchy, State, and Utopia, which shocked the\nphilosophical world with its robust and sophisticated defense of the\nminimal state—the state that restricts its activities to the\nprotection of individual rights of life, liberty, property, and\ncontract and eschews the use of state power to redistribute income, to\nmake people moral, or to protect people from harming themselves.\nNozick went on to publish important works that ranged over\nmetaphysics, epistemology, the philosophy of science, and\naxiology—Philosophical Explanations (1981), The\nExamined Life (1989), The Nature of Rationality\n(1993), Socratic Puzzles (1997), and Invariances\n(2001).  Nozick’s always lively, engaging, audacious, and\nphilosophically ambitious writings revealed an amazing knowledge of\nadvanced work in many disciplines including decision theory,\neconomics, mathematics, physics, psychology, and religion. Robert\nNozick died in 2002 from stomach cancer for which he was first treated\nin 1994.  As an undergraduate student at Columbia and at least in his early\ndays as a graduate student at Princeton, Nozick endorsed socialism. At\nColumbia, he was a founder of what was to become the local chapter of\nStudents for a Democratic Society. The major force in his conversion\nto libertarian views was his conversations at Princeton with his\nfellow philosophy graduate student, Bruce Goldberg. It was through\nGoldberg that Nozick met the economist Murray Rothbard who was the\nmajor champion of “individualist anarchism” in the later\ndecades of the twentieth century (Raico 2002, Other Internet\nResources). Nozick’s encounter with Rothbard and Rothbard’s\nrights-based critique of the state (Rothbard 1973 and\n1978)—including the minimal state—lead Nozick to the\nproject of formulating a rights-based libertarianism that would\nvindicate the minimal state. There is, however, an intriguing lacuna\nin this story. Goldberg himself and the economists whose writings are\noften said to have influenced Nozick’s conversion to\nlibertarianism—F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman—were not at\nall friends of natural rights theory. So, we have no account of why\nthe libertarianism that Nozick himself adopted came in the form of\nnatural rights theory (and an associated doctrine of acquired property\nrights). This account of the political philosophy of Robert Nozick is\nfundamentally an account of the rights-oriented libertarian doctrine\nthat Nozick presents in Anarchy, State, and Utopia. That\ndoctrine is the Nozickean\ndoctrine.[2]\nNozick never attempted to further develop the views that he expressed\nin\nASU,[3]\nand he never responded to the extensive critical reaction to those\nviews. Nozick did seem to repudiate at least some aspects of\nthe ASU doctrine in The Examined Life and The\nNature of Rationality (Nozick 1989: 286–296). Nozick’s real\nor apparent repudiation in these works turned on his doctrine of\nsymbolic utility which cannot be examined\nhere.[4] \n At later yet points in his life Nozick downplayed his \napparent repudiation of political\nlibertarianism.[5]\nIn a 2001 interview, he said:  \n… the rumors of my deviation (or apostasy!) from libertarianism\nwere much exaggerated. I think [Invariances] makes clear the\nextent to which I still am within the general framework of\nlibertarianism, especially the ethics chapter and its section on the\n“Core Principle of Ethics”. (Sanchez 2001, Other Internet\nResources) According to that chapter, there are a number of layers of\nethics. The first of these is the ethics of respect which consists of\na set of negative rights. This layer and only this layer may be made\nmandatory in any society. “All that any society should\n(coercively) demand is adherence to the ethics of respect”\n(Nozick 2001: 282). There are four main topics that most deserve discussion with\nrespect to Anarchy, State, and Utopia. They are: (1) the\nunderpinning (if any) and the character and robustness of the moral\nrights that constitute the basic normative framework for most\nof Anarchy, State, and Utopia; (2) the character and degree\nof success of Nozick’s defense of the minimal state against the charge\nby the individualist anarchist that “the state itself is\nintrinsically immoral” (ASU 51); (3) Nozick’s\narticulation and defense of his historical entitlement doctrine of\njustice in holdings and his associated critique of end-state and\npatterned doctrines of distributive justice, especially John Rawls’\ndifference principle (as defended in A Theory of Justice);\nand (4) Nozick’s argument that utopian aspirations provide a\ncomplementary route to the vindication of the minimal state. Our\ndiscussion of the first two topics focuses on Part I of ASU,\nentitled “State-of-Nature Theory or How to Back into a State\nwithout Really Trying”. Our investigation of the third topic,\nthe historical entitlement doctrine of just holdings and competing\nconceptions of distributive justice, focuses on chapter 7,\n“Distributive Justice” of Part II of ASU,\n“Beyond the Minimal State?” Our discussion of the fourth\ntopic, the utopian route to the minimal state, focuses on chapter 10,\n“A Framework for Utopia”, which is the whole of Part III\nof ASU, “Utopia”. Focusing on these four core\ntopics leaves aside many of Nozick’s rich and intriguing side\ndiscussions. Anarchy, State, and Utopia opens with the famously bold\nclaim that “Individuals have rights, and there are things no\nperson or group may do to them (without violating their rights)”\n(ix). These moral rights are understood as state of nature rights.  That\nis, they are rights that precede and provide a basis for assessing and\nconstraining not only the actions of individuals and groups but also\nthe conduct of political and legal institutions. These rights also\nprecede any social contract; they morally constrain the conduct of\nindividuals, groups, and institutions even in the absence of any\nsocial contract. In Locke’s language, these rights constitute a law of\nnature—or an especially important part of a law of\nnature—that governs the pre-political and pre-contractual state\nof nature (Locke 1690: Second Treatise §6).  Moreover, to possess such a right is not merely to be in some\ncondition the promotion or maintenance of which is socially\nexpedient. Part of the message of that opening proclamation is that\nthere are certain things that may not be done to individuals even if,\nby some standard, they are socially optimizing. The rights that\nindividuals have are moral bulwarks against behavior that promotes\neven the most radiant—or apparently radiant—social end.\nIn addition, these state of nature moral rights are taken to be\nnegative. They specify types of conduct that may not be done to\nindividuals rather than types of conduct that must be done for\npeople.  Finally, since these rights are not granted by institutions,\ncreated by any contractual process, or accorded to individuals for the\nsake of advancing some optimal social outcome, if they have any\nfoundation, that foundation must consist in some morally impressive\nfact about the nature of individuals qua individuals. Some\nmorally impressive fact about the nature of individuals—e.g.,\nthat they each have ends or projects of their own to which they\nrationally devote themselves—must provide others with reason to\nnot treat them certain ways, e.g., as beings who ought to serve the\nends of others. We shall see that Nozick advances a claim of this sort\nin his account of why agents should abide by moral side-constraints in\ntheir conduct toward others. Recourse to the familiar distinction between claim-rights and\nliberty-rights will enable us to be somewhat more precise about the\nstate of nature rights that Nozick ascribes to each individual.\nLiberty-rights are absences of obligations. You have a liberty-right\nto scratch your nose as long as you have no obligation not\nto. Claim-rights are moral (and enforceable) claims against others to\ntheir acting or not acting in certain ways. You have a claim-right\nagainst others not to be interfered with in the scratching of your\nnose if and only if others have an (enforceable) obligation\nnot to interfere with you in this way.  Standardly, when we speak of\nrights we are speaking of composites of liberty-rights and\nclaim-rights. For instance, standardly, your right to scratch your\nnose consists in your having no obligation not to do so and others\nhaving (enforceable) obligations not to interfere with your doing\nso. Your moral liberty to scratch your nose is morally protected by\nyour (enforceable) claim against others that they not interfere with\nyour doing so.  When Nozick asserts that individuals possess pre-political,\npre-contractual moral rights against certain things being done to\nthem—even for the sake of ends that are or purport to be\nsocially optimal—he is most obviously ascribing claim-rights to\nindividuals correlative to which are pre-political and pre-contractual\nmoral obligations of each agent not to do certain\nthings to other individuals. Since, all state of nature obligations\n(that are rights-correlative and, hence, enforceable) are negative, in\nthe state of nature individuals are morally at liberty to engage\nin any conduct that does not transgress others’ state of\nnature claim-rights. Thus, Nozick’s opening proclamation of rights\naffirms for each individual extensive liberty-rights—extensive\nfreedom from obligations, especially positive obligations—that\nare systematically protected against interference by moral\nclaim-rights. It needs to be mentioned that these moral rights are\ntaken to be people’s baseline rights; they are rights that are subject\nto contraction or expansion through an individual’s actions and\ninteractions. So, e.g., although each individual has a natural right\nagainst all others not to be struck in her nose, each may waive that\nright by agreeing to take place in a boxing match, and each may\nacquire a liberty-right to strike the other party to the boxing\ncontract. It is a commonplace to say that in ASU Nozick provides no\nfoundation for his affirmation of such Lockean natural rights (Nagel\n1975). And, not many pages after Nozick proclaims these rights, he\nhimself points out that his book provides no “precise theory of\nthe moral basis of individual rights” (xiv). Nevertheless,\nNozick does have important things to say about the underpinning of\nthese rights and about their deontic character and their\nstringency. Indeed, it is striking that, when Nozick seeks to motivate\nhis opening affirmation of rights, he starts with the same\nunderstanding and critique of utilitarianism that Rawls offers\nin A Theory of Justice when Rawls begins to motivate his\ncontractarian doctrine. What separates Nozick from Rawls at this very\nbasic level is a difference in their construal of the implications of\nthis common critique. Nozick may, in this way, offer as much of a\nfoundation for adopting his natural rights stance as Rawls offers\nin A Theory of Justice for adopting his contractarian\nstance. As is well known, Rawls starts by ascribing to the utilitarian the\nclaim that the rationality of a certain principle of social choice can\nbe inferred from the rationality of a certain principle of individual\nchoice. The principle of individual choice is that, at least if no\nother party is affected, it is rational for an individual to incur\ncosts for herself (or to forego benefits for herself) if doing so will\nspare her greater costs (or provide her with greater\nbenefits). According to Rawls, the utilitarian holds that by parity of\nreasoning it is rational for a member of society to incur costs for\nherself (or to forego benefits for herself) if doing so will\nspare any member of society greater costs (or\nprovide any member of society with greater benefits). This is\nthe purported rational principle of social choice. Thus, we get to the\nutilitarian conclusion that each agent as a member of society has\nreason to maximize the aggregate social good even at the expense of\nthe individual good of herself (or others).  As is also well-known, Rawls rejects this reasoning on the grounds\nthat it does not take seriously the separateness and distinctness of\npersons. Persons are markedly more separate and distinct from one\nanother than are the different phases or time-slices of a given\nperson’s life. Because of this, one cannot proceed from its being\nworthwhile for a given person to incur costs for herself in order to\nspare herself greater costs to its being worthwhile for a given person\nas a member of society to incur costs for herself in order to spare\nany member of society greater costs. According to Rawls, only if we\nconflate individuals—only if we mistakenly conceive of them as\nparts of a single person-like being, will the utilitarian principle of\nsocial choice be on a par with the principle of individual choice\n(Rawls 1971: 26–7). Rawls summarizes his primary case against utilitarianism by\nsaying, … if we assume that the correct regulative principle for\nanything depends on the nature of that thing, and the plurality of\ndistinct persons with separate systems of ends is an essential feature\nof human societies, we should not expect the principles of social\nchoice to be utilitarian. (Rawls 1971: 29) This summation goes well beyond the dismissal of the utilitarian\nregulative principle. For it strongly suggests a criterion for\nidentifying the correct regulative principle (or set of principles)\nfor the governance of social interaction. Such regulative principles\nmust differ significantly from the utilitarian principle by being\nresponsive to or reflective of the plurality of distinct persons with\nseparate systems of ends. We should note here that what is crucial is\nnot the bare normatively neutral fact that individuals have separate\nsystems of ends but, rather that individuals rationally seek to\npromote their own ends. It is the rational propriety of each person’s\npursuit her own good that basic regulative principles need to be\nresponsive to or reflect. Rawls then offers his crucial contractarian\nconstrual of how regulative principles qualify as being responsive to\nor reflective of the plurality of persons.  According to Rawls, they\nso qualify by being principles that all individuals concerned with the\npromotion of their own systems of ends would agree to under\ncircumstances suitable for such agreement. It is striking that Nozick proceeds through a highly similar\ncritical treatment of utilitarianism when he asks why persons may not\nbe violated for the greater social good. Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or\nsacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm… In\neach case, some cost is borne for the sake of the greater overall\ngood. Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some\ncosts that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall\nsocial good? (ASU 32) Nozick’s response to this question is, But there is no social entity with a good that undergoes\nsome sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people,\ndifferent individual people, with their own individual lives. Using\none of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits\nthe others. Nothing more. What happens is that something is done to\nhim for the sake of others. Talk of an overall social good covers this\nup. (32–3) Here Nozick makes things too easy for himself by ascribing to the\nutilitarian a belief in a social entity—as Rawls makes things\ntoo easy for himself by saying that the utilitarian argument depends\non fusing or conflating persons. For the utilitarian may simply hold\nthat the best explanation for the rationality of a given person\nincurring some cost for herself in order to avoid some greater cost\nfor herself is the unrestricted rationality of minimizing net costs\n(or maximizing net benefits). According to this utilitarian, we do not\nhave to move from the principle of individual choice to the principle\nof social choice. For, we start with the unrestricted rationality of\nminimizing costs (or maximizing benefits); and the principle of\nindividual choice is simply the application of that principle of\nsocial choice to the special case in which there is only one agent who\nis also the one subject of benefits and costs. To counter the contention that, at the outset, practical\nrationality calls for the minimization of net costs (or the\nmaximization of net benefits), Rawls and Nozick need to hold that what\nmakes it practically rational for a given individual to incur some\ncost to herself (or forego some benefit for herself)\nis the avoidance of some greater cost to herself (or the\nattainment of some greater benefit for herself). They need to\nhold that (at least absent further argument) the rational balancing of\ncosts incurred (or benefits foregone) and costs avoided (or benefits\nattained) must take place within lives and not across lives. And this\ndoes seem to be part of the intended force of Rawls’ invocation of a\n“plurality of distinct persons with separate systems of\nends”[6] and\nof Nozick’s insistence that there are “only individual people,\ndifferent individual people, with their own individual lives”\n(33). In Nozick this stance is most explicit when he parses “the\nfact of our separate existences” as, … the fact that no moral balancing act can take place among\nus; there is no moral outweighing of one of our lives by others so as\nto lead to a great overall social good. There is no justified\nsacrifice of some of us for others. (33) Note, however, that this last sentence is ambiguous. It may mean\nsimply that there is no moral balancing across individuals that\nrequires individuals to sacrifice for others or that justifies others\nin imposing such sacrifices. However, that sentence may also mean that\n“no one may be sacrificed for others” (33) in the sense\nthat those who impose such sacrifices wrong the individuals\nwho are subjected to those losses. That is, it may also mean that\nthere is (in Rawls’ terminology) a “correct regulative\nprinciple” that forbids and condemns the imposition of such\nsacrifices. It is clear that Nozick intends to assert this further\nclaim even though he does not explicitly recognize that it is a\nfurther and distinct proposition. For, according to Nozick, one will\nnot “sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he\n[i.e., any given individual] is a separate person, that his is the\nonly life he has” (33) unless one morally condemns and eschews\nuses of that person—in particular, impositions of losses on that\nperson for the sake of (what purports to be) the social good. The “fact of our separate existences” is “the\nfact that that no moral balancing act can take place among us”\n(because costs and benefits add up within persons’ lives and not\nacross them). In contrast, the further fact that there are moral\nside-constraints against imposing sacrifices on some to serve the\ninterests of others is a reflection of the “fact of\nour separate existences”. We come to the affirmation of those\nside-constraints when we sufficiently respect and take account of the\nseparateness of\n persons.[7]\nThis is what Nozick must mean when he says\nthat “The moral side constraints upon what we may do…\nreflect the fact of our separate existences” (33). The fact of\nour separate existences—as Nozick parses that fact—is the\nmorally impressive fact about the nature of individuals that provides\nus with reason to be circumspect in our conduct toward one\nanother. We respect or honor others as agents with rational ends of\ntheir own not by promoting their ends as we do our own but, rather,\nby not sacrificing them to our ends. If correct regulative principles for social interaction must\nsufficiently respect and take account of the plurality of distinct\npersons with separate systems of ends, those regulative principles\nmust not treat persons as means for the attainment of any\n(putatively) choice-worthy social outcome. Regulative principles that\nendorse the use of persons for the sake of (purportedly)\nchoice-worthy social outcomes—e.g., the social outcome of there\nbeing a choice-worthy distribution of goods among\nindividuals—too much resemble the utilitarian regulative\nprinciple. They share the failure of the utilitarian principle to\nsufficiently respect and take account of the plurality of distinct\npersons with separate systems of ends. Thus, Nozick contends, correct\nregulative principles must take the form of moral side constraints\nupon what may be done to individuals even for the sake of really\nvaluable, choice-worthy social outcomes. Rawls reads the willingness\nof utilitarianism to impose losses on individuals for the sake of the\naggregate good as a mark of utilitarianism’s failure to recognize the\nstatus of individuals as ends-in-themselves and not merely means to\nthe ends of others.  Nozick follows suit in appropriating this\nKantian language (see Cohen 1995: 238–243). But, contrary to\nRawls, Nozick maintains that the endorsement of the imposition of\nsacrifices on individuals for the sake of any (non-trivial)\nconception of the social good—even, e.g.,\ndistribution-sensitive conceptions of the social good—fails to\nrecognize the status of individuals\n as ends-in-themselves.[8] So, Nozick offers very much the same type of argument for the\nexistence of some correct regulative principle for social\ninteraction as Rawls does in A Theory of Justice. The\ndifference is that Nozick does not hold that the mark of principles\nbeing responsive to or reflective of the fact of our separate\nexistences is that they would be agreed to by everyone under suitable\nagreement circumstances. Rather, he supposes that we can identify\ntypes of treatment of persons as not sufficiently respecting and\ntaking account of the rationality of individuals pursuing of their own\ngood without having to appeal to any actual or hypothetical agreement.\nIn particular, the imposition of sacrifices upon individuals does not\nsufficiently take account of their being agents who rationally pursue\ntheir own systems of ends. The key “moral content gotten by this\nargument which focuses upon the fact that there are distinct\nindividuals each with his own life to lead” is that\n“sacrificing one person to benefit another” is morally\nprohibited (34). For Nozick, a paradigmatic natural moral right is the right not to\nbe subjected to (unprovoked) killing. Correlative to this right is the\nmoral side constraint to which all individuals are naturally subject\nnot to engage in the (unprovoked) killing of others. As Nozick\nunderstands this right, it forbids A’s (unprovoked) killing\nof B even if A can prevent W from\nkilling X, Y, and Z only by\nkilling B. Although it may in some sense be less\nbad for B to be killed than for X, Y,\nand Z to be killed, A remains bound not to\nkill B. A may not prevent the wrong that W\nwill do in killing X, Y, and Z by\nkilling B. For Nozick, rights express the moral inviolability\nof individuals; and B would not be morally\ninviolable—nor would any of us be—were B open to\nuse by A even for the purpose of preventing the violation of\nthe rights of X, Y, and Z. Not even the\nminimization of the violation of the right against being killed can\njustify the violation of that right. According to Nozick, our core reason for abstaining from murder is\nnot that abstention advances the goal of minimizing murders.  Indeed,\nif that were our reason to eschew murder, A should not eschew\nmurdering B if that is the only way that he can\nprevent W from murdering X, Y,\nand Z.  Rather, Nozick’s deontological claim is that the\nstatus that each individual has as an end-in-himself morally\nconstrains each other agent’s conduct toward those\nindividuals. Both A and W are morally precluded from\nthe (unprovoked) killing of B, X, Y,\nand Z (and of each other). W triply violates this\nside constraint when he kills X, Y, and Z;\nbut A abides by this constraint only if he abstains\nfrom killing B—even if A’s killing\nof B would (somehow) prevent W’s killing\nof X, Y, and Z. It is often thought that there is something paradoxical about\ndeontological propositions like the assertion that everyone is bound\nto abstain from the (unprovoked) killing of\nothers.[9] This\nthought rests on two standard consequentialist ideas. The first is\nthat the wrongness of a given sort of action—e.g., (unprovoked)\nkilling—must derive from the badness of the (typical)\nconsequences of actions of that sort. The second is that the badness\nof the consequences of multiple actions of a given sort can be\naggregated so that (typically) the total badness of the results of a\nbunch of wrongful actions of that sort will be greater than the\nbadness of the results of one action of that sort. For example, the\ntotal badness associated with W’s (unprovoked) killings\nof X, Y, and Z will (typically) be greater\nthan the badness associated with A’s (unprovoked) killing\nof B. It follows that it will (typically) be wrong\nfor A to abstain from killing B if that is the only\nway to prevent W’s (unprovoked) killings\nof X, Y, and Z. The supposed paradox is\nthat the wrongfulness of (unprovoked) killing must rest on the\nbadness of the (typical) results of such killings; but recourse to\nthe badness of results in the assessment of actions (typically) leads\nto the endorsement of (unprovoked) killings in precisely those cases\nin which the advocate of deontic constraints wants to insist upon\ntheir wrongfulness.  However, the construction of this paradox of\ndeontology rests firmly upon ideas that Nozick has rejected on his\nway to asserting deontic side constraints. Nozick also provides a further and seemingly more conventional discussion of\nthe bases for moral constraints in which various lofty capacities that\nhuman beings (usually) possess or are thought to possess are cited. He\nmentions being [S]entient and self-conscious; rational (capable of using abstract\nconcepts, not tied to responses to immediate stimuli); possessing free\nwill; being a moral agent capable of guiding its behavior by moral\nprinciples and capable of engaging in mutual limitation of conduct;\nhaving a soul. (48) To these he adds “the ability to regulate and guide its life\nin accordance with some overall conception it chooses to\naccept” (49). But, does the presence of these non-moral\nfeatures underwrite moral constraints against preventing individuals\nfrom exercising these capacities in their own chosen ways? Nozick\nseeks to bolster the significance of these features by contending\nthat a person can give meaning to his life only by exercising these\ncapacities in accordance with some overall plan of his own (50). The suggestion is that it is not meaningfulness at large that is crucial for each individual but, rather the meaningfulness for him of the life that arises through his exercise of an overall plan for his life.[10] However, Nozick then asks  \nwhy not replace ‘happiness’ with ‘meaningfulness’\nwithin utilitarian theory, and maximize the total\n‘meaningfulness’ score of the persons in the\nworld? (50) Nozick’s account of rights takes a surprising turn in his very\ncomplex chapter 4 on “Prohibition, Compensation, and\nRisk” (Mack 1981). Employing the language of rights as moral\nboundaries, Nozick asks whether all actions that cross boundaries may\nbe prohibited, i.e., may permissibly be\npunished.[11]\nHis unexpected answer is that not all boundary crossings may be\nprohibited. Some boundary crossings are to be allowed—without\nthe consent of those subject to them—as long as due\ncompensation is paid to those subjects.  Nozick’s\npresumption within this chapter is that it does\nnot follow from B’s having a right\nagainst A to A’s not inflicting\ntreatment T on B that A’s\ninflicting T on A may be prohibited (59). All\nthat follows from B’s having that right is\nthat A may not inflict T on B\nunless A also duly compensates\nB.[12]\nAll that follows is that B has a claim\nagainst A that A’s infliction of T\non B not leave B’s utility or welfare on net diminished. We can describe Nozick’s position here by utilizing the now common\ndistinction between claims that are protected by property rules and\nclaims that are protected by liability rules (338n6). One’s claim with\nrespect to some object O is protected by a property rule if\none must be allowed to do as one sees fit with O—as\nlong as one abides by the applicable side constraints. Others may not\ndeprive one of one’s choice with respect to O—even if\nthey also compensate one for the utility or welfare loss of being\nprecluded from doing as one sees fit with O. In contrast,\none’s claim with respect to O is merely protected by a\nliability rule if others may determine (without one’s consent) what is\ndone with O as long as they duly compensate one for the\nassociated utility or welfare loss. In chapter 4, Nozick’s\npresumption seems to be that all that follows from one’s\nhaving a right is that one has a claim that is protected by a\nliability rule.  Of course, it may be impossible or severely difficult\nfor A to duly compensate B for inflicting\ntreatment T—as when T consists in\nkilling B.  Moreover, if it is impossible or severely\ndifficult for A to duly compensate B for a given\nboundary crossing, A must not cross that boundary\nwithout B’s consent.  The conjunction of the\nliability rule claim and the impossibility or difficulty of due\ncompensation yields (the equivalent of) a property rule claim\nfor B against A’s imposing T\non B. The further conditions that render due compensation\nimpossible or difficult boost what would otherwise merely be a\nliability rule claim against being subject to T into (the\nequivalent of) a property rule claim against being subject\nto T. As we see in the next section, Nozick thinks that such\nboosting conditions are pervasive. So, one of the things that Nozick\nis doing in his intricate chapter 4 is arguing that, even if we start\nwith the relatively modest liability rule conception of rights, we can\nreach the conclusion that most rights have the force of claims that\nare protected by property rules.  Perhaps, we ought not to be too surprised by Nozick’s chapter 4\npresumption that in themselves rights are merely claims that are\nprotected by liability rules. For recall the crucial role ascribed to\nnatural rights within Nozick’s separateness of persons argument. That\nrole is to provide individuals with moral protection against having\nsacrifices (i.e., net losses) imposed upon them. All that rights must\ndo in order to play this role is to require that all\nboundary-crossings be accompanied by due compensation (and that they\nnot be done if the provision of due accompanying compensation is not\nfeasible). However, Nozick’s focus on rights having the role of protecting\nindividuals from net losses being imposed upon them raised concerns\nfor him about whether invocations of rights would deliver the strong\nanti-paternalism that he\n favored.[13]\nIf rights are in themselves merely\nclaims against having one’s utility or welfare on net lowered by\ncertain interferences, then one will have no right against\ninterferences that on net raise one’s utility or welfare. Arguments\nthat “will prohibit sacrificing one person to benefit\nanother” will not themselves deliver “a prohibition on\npaternalist aggression” (34). Rights against paternalist\ninterventions that really do serve interests of the paternalized\nparty must protect the choices of that party—even choices that\nwill lower her utility or welfare. Moreover, the view that rights in themselves are claims protected\nby liability rules does not comport well with the overall tone\nof Anarchy, State, and Utopia. Nozick does not begin this\nwork by declaring that there are things that may not be done to\nindividuals unless, of course, they are duly compensated. Nor\ndoes the liability rule construal of rights fit well with Nozick’s\naffirmation of the inviolability of individuals, the Kantian claim\nthat individuals “may not be sacrificed or used for the\nachieving of other ends without their consent” (31,\nemphasis added), or the moral sovereignty of individuals (34). Indeed,\nat one point Nozick himself says that “a system permitting\nboundary crossing, provided compensation is paid, embodies the use\nof persons as means…” (71, emphasis added). It\nembodies the use of persons as means because it allows such use as\nlong as the utility or welfare of the used party is not on net\ndiminished. The provision of due compensation counteracts the imposed\nloss of utility or welfare; but it does not counteract the use. In the next section, we shall focus on Nozick’s use of this\nliability rule attenuation of rights in his response to the\nanarchist. We should note, however, that after disposing of the\nanarchist Nozick reverts to the more robust property rule\nunderstanding of rights. Thus, in chapter 7, on “Distributive\nJustice”, Nozick says that, The central core of the notion of a property rights in X\n… is the right to determine what shall be done with X,\nthe right to choose which of the constrained set of options\nconcerning X shall be realized or attempted. (171) To have a right in X is to have a claim protected by a\nproperty rule. Others’ interference with one’s doing as one sees fit\nwith X is impermissible—even if one is duly compensated\nfor imposed utility or welfare losses. And Nozick goes on to extend\nthis property rule construal to people’s rights in themselves and\ntheir labor. This notion of property helps us understand why earlier theorists\nspoke of people as having property in themselves and their labor.\nThey viewed each person as having a right to decide what would become\nof himself and what he would do… (171) Indeed, in chapter 7, Nozick argues that seizing the fruits of a\nperson’s labor is impermissible because this involves taking the time\nthat this person devoted to this labor without that person’s\nconsent. There is no hint that the taking of that time without that\nparty’s consent would be permissible if only that party were duly\ncompensated. There is no hint that the requirement that this\nindividual consent to any taking depends upon due compensation for\nsuch a taking being impossible or severely difficult. We should also note that this passage about earlier theorists\nspeaking of people as having property in themselves is the closest\nNozick ever comes to formulating his own position in terms of a\ndoctrine of self-ownership. Contrary to common presentations\nof Nozick’s doctrine, there is no mention of self-ownership within\nhis Part I discussion of state of nature\ntheory.[14]\nThroughout Part I, Nozick is content to have his readers fill in the\ncontent of moral side constraints by drawing on their intuitions\nthat, if there are any moral side constraints, they must include\nconstraints against (unprovoked) killing, assaulting, maiming,\nenslaving. There is, at most, a hint that all of these constraints\ncan be subsumed under a general constraint against aggression\n(34). (It seems, however, that aggression itself requires explication\non the basis of a prior and independent specification of persons’\nrights.) Overall, Nozick maintains that there is something about the\nseparateness of persons—something about the propriety of each\nseeking his own good in his own chosen way—that does not merely\nundermine the view that individuals should sacrifice themselves (and\nothers) for the social good. Beyond that undermining, the separateness\nof persons positively supports each individual’s possession of\nfundamental, broad, natural, and negative moral claims that hold\nagainst all other agents. What Nozick needs is a clearly articulated\nand persuasive transition from each individual having ends of his own\nthat he is rational to pursue (and, hence, there being no proper moral\nbalancing across persons) to each individual having a moral\nstatus vis-á-vis others that provides others with reason not\nto interfere with his chosen pursuits even in ways that would be on\nnet beneficial to that individual. Nozick provides material that is\nsuggestive of this transition but certainly not a compelling case for\nit. Nozick also fails to address the hard question of why—except\nperhaps to avoid “catastrophic moral horror” (29\nfootnote*)—rights always trump considerations of personal or social\nwell-being. The official purpose of Part I of ASU is to rebut the\nindividualist anarchist’s claim that no state, not even the minimal,\nnightwatchman, state can be\n justified.[15]\nIn this way, Part I is devoted to what\nNozick takes to be the fundamental question of political philosophy,\nviz., “whether there should be any state at all”\n(4). Nozick seeks to counter the anarchist’s claim by showing how a\nminimal state—essentially a state that is limited to the\nprotection of the rights of person, property, and\ncontract—could arise without violating rights. At a later point\nwithin this section, we shall have to consider why Nozick focuses\nupon whether a minimal state could arise without violating\nrights rather than whether a minimal state could function\nwithout violating rights. Nozick expects that it will take a considerable effort to answer\nthe individualist anarchist precisely because this form of\nanti-statism is itself rooted in the moral rights that Nozick\nproclaims. Indeed, immediately following his ascription to individuals\nof pre-political, pre-contractual, negative moral rights Nozick tells\nus that these rights may so extensively limit the permissible use of\nforce that no room is left for a morally acceptable\nstate.  So strong and far-reaching are these rights\nthat they raise the question of what, if anything the state and its\nofficials may do. How much room do individual rights leave for the\nstate? (ix)  To be clear about Nozick’s response, we first need to be clear\nabout what alternative structure for the protection of rights is\nenvisioned by the individualist anarchist. Second, we need to clearly\nidentify the precise challenge that Nozick needs to overcome. First, then, Nozick and the individualist anarchist agree that it\nis one thing for individuals to have rights and another thing for them\nto have rights to the protection of their rights. It is one thing to\nhave a right against others that they not aggress against one; it is\nanother thing to have rights against others that they protect one\nagainst aggression. Being a positive right, the right to protection\nagainst violations of one’s rights must arise through some special\ninteraction between the agent who acquires the right and the agent who\nacquires the correlative obligation. The most common kind of special\ninteraction that gives rise to one agent having a positive right\nagainst another is contract. However, the individualist anarchist and\nNozick agree that there has never been any general social contract\nwhereby individuals at large acquire from one another positive rights\nto the protection of their pre-contractual rights. And,\n“… tacit consent isn’t worth the paper it’s not written\non” (287). Hence, if people are to acquire rights to have their\nrights protected, they must (at least for the most part) go shopping\nfor them. Moreover, the individualist anarchist asserts—and Nozick is\nstrongly disposed to agree—that shoppers for any sort of service\nwill do best when there is a competitive market in the supply of that\nsort of service. Competition among good-willed providers of the\nservice of rights protection will induce lower prices and/or higher\nquality rights protection—including protection against\n“outlaw” agencies that seek to assist or protect rights\nviolators. The interest of good-willed purchasers of rights protection\nin non-violent dispute resolution will press competing suppliers of\nrights protection to join in agreements that more sharply define the\nboundaries of their clients and establish procedures for resolving\ndisputes among them. Any protective agency that is not part of a\nnetwork of established conflict diminishing agreements and resolution\nprocedures will be at a huge competitive disadvantage.  Nozick refers\nto the resulting network as the dominant protective association; and\nhe treats the question of whether the minimal state can arise without\nviolating rights as a matter of whether such a dominant protective\nassociation can develop into a minimal state without violating\nrights. Second, anarchists like Rothbard assert that the creation and\nmaintenance of even the minimal state will violate rights in two\nfundamental ways. First, even the minimal state will arise through\nand sustain itself through imposed taxation. Second, even the minimal\nstate will arise through and sustain itself through the coercive\nsuppression or control of competing protective agencies.  However,\nthe minimal state that Nozick seeks to defend is simply not subject\nto the first of these challenges. For, despite some ill-chosen\nlanguage that suggests the contrary (26–7), Nozick’s minimal\nstate does not impose taxation—even to fund its rights\nprotective\n activities.[16]\nNozick’s minimal state does prohibit\nindividuals who interact with its clients from becoming clients of\ncompeting agencies (that are not subject to supervision and\nconstraint by the minimal state).  However, it does not require\nanyone to subscribe to its services.  Principled anarchists and even\nindividuals who hope to free-ride on the minimal state’s overall\nsuppression of rights\n violations[17]\nare morally at liberty to take their\nchances. However, to be a state—even a minimal state—an\ninstitution has to have some sort of monopoly on the use of coercive\nforce over a sufficiently large territory or set of people. To rise to\nstatehood within a given territory or with respect to a set of people,\na protective agency must fairly successfully fulfill its aspiration to\nbe the suppressor of other actors who seek to engage in rights\nviolating force and (at least) to be the controller of other actors\nwho seek to engage in rights protecting force. Hence, to rise to\nstatehood, a protective agency must either shut down or exercise\nsubstantial control over other non-outlaw agencies. In short,\nit seems that it must act toward its non-outlaw competitors in ways\nthat Nozick would declare to be impermissible among competitors in the\ndelivery of any other sort of service. Nozick must attempt to meet the\nanarchist’s second challenge by arguing that the dominant protective\nagency’s establishment of a monopoly in protective services differs\nmarkedly from the standard suppression or control of competitors. Before considering how and how successfully Nozick meets this\nchallenge, we need to take note of a questionable preliminary move on\nhis part. When Nozick mentions the agreements that competing agencies\nwould enter into in order to assure their prospective clients smooth\nand non-violent dispute resolution, he speaks of the emergence of\n“a system of appeals courts and agreed upon rules of\njurisdiction and the conflict of laws”. He acknowledges that the\nemergence of this system allows for the continued operation of\n“different agencies”. Yet he then says that the result is\n“one unified federal judicial system of which they [presumably\nthe various agencies] all are components” (16). On the basis of\nthis description of the outcome of the networking process Nozick\nallows himself to speak of the rise of a dominant protective\nassociation that is united and federal.  This language seems to paper over the continued existence of\n“different agencies” which may well compete with one\nanother not merely in terms of prices but also in terms of the\npackages of protective services they offer in response to diverse\nconsumer demand for such services. So Nozick faces a problem even if\nhe succeeds in showing that the confederation of agencies\nthat emerges from such networking may permissibly eliminate its\nnon-outlaw competitors. For, there may still be too much\ncompetition among the confederates that make up the dominant\nassociation for it to qualify as a state (Childs 1977 and Mack\n1978). Putting that initial problem aside, one possible way for Nozick to\nmeet the anarchist’s challenge is to maintain that the dominant\nprotective association will eliminate its\ncompetitors without using coercive force. Perhaps something\nabout the production and delivery of rights protection makes that\nenterprise a natural monopoly. Nozick seems to be pursuing\nthis route when he asks and answers the question, “Why would a\nvirtual monopoly arise in this market without the government\nintervention that elsewhere creates and maintains it?”\n(17). His answer is that the value of the protective services offered\nby any agency will increase with the size of its\nclientele—presumably because disputes among clients of the same\nagency will be more cheaply or readily resolved than disputes among\nclients of competing agencies. So, clients of competing agencies will\nmigrate to the dominant association and that migration will increase\nthe incentive for yet others to follow the same\npath.[18] However, this claim about the propensity for “virtual”\nmonopoly to arise within the rights protection business is only\nintended by Nozick to explain the emergence of a dominant protective\nassociation; it is not intended to explain that association’s\npermissible suppression or control of its remaining non-outlaw\ncompetitors. Nozick accepts the anarchist contention that, for an\nagency to rise to or sustain itself as a state, it must suppress or\ncontrol actual (or potential) non-outlaw competitors. To meet the\nanarchist’s challenge, Nozick sets out to show how the dominant\nassociation’s suppression or control of non-outlaw competitors is not\na violation of the rights of those competitors—even though they\nare non-outlaws. Nozick’s case relies upon the surprising attenuation of rights that\nwe noted in the previous section, viz., the idea that in themselves\nrights are claims that are protected by liability rules. Absent\nfurther conditions that make due compensation for infringements\nimpossible or severely difficult, rights are merely claims to be duly\ncompensated for losses imposed by certain interferences. Given this\nconstrual of rights, the basic structure of Nozick’s response to the\nanarchist is quite simple. The rights of non-outlaw protective\nagencies (and non-outlaw independent self-protectors) to engage in\ntheir chosen procedures are merely claims that are protected by\nliability rules. Hence, those procedures may be interfered with as\nlong as those subject to this interference are duly compensated. The\nanarchist is correct in saying that these non-outlaw agencies and\nindividuals have rights against being interfered with; but he is\nmistaken in thinking that these rights forbid that interference.  Of course, a further premise is needed for this argument. This is\nthat it will not be impossible or severely difficult to duly\ncompensate those non-outlaw agencies and individuals for interference\nwith their own protective activities and, hence, their claims against\nsuch interference do not acquire the force of claims protected by\nproperty rules. (If the claims do acquire that force, the anarchist\ncorrectly condemns the dominant association’s interference with those\nagencies or individuals.) To support this further premise, Nozick\nneeds to survey the conditions that do made it impossible or severely\ndifficult to supply due compensation for boundary crossings. A\nboundary will have the force of a claim protected by a property rule\nif and only if such a condition is present. Much of the intricacy (and\nopacity) of ASU’s chapter 4 resides within this survey. There are some boundary crossings—like killings, maiming, or\nand lifetime enslaving—for which due compensation is simply\nimpossible.  If some injuries are not compensable, they would not fall\nunder a policy of being allowed as long as compensation is paid.\n(Rather, they would be allowed provided compensation was paid, but\nsince the compensation could not be paid by anyone, in effect they\nwould be unallowed.) (65–6) However, Nozick focuses on two factors that severely complicate the\ntask of identifying due compensation for boundary crossings. The\nfirst is fear (65–71). Here is one way that fear complicates\nthe identification of due compensation. Suppose we treat the right\nthat each individual has not to have her forearm broken as a claim\nprotected by a liability rule. And suppose further that we know what\nthe due compensation is for having one’s forearm broken. On this\nbasis we decide to allow unconsented to forearm breaking as long as\nthe forearm breaker duly compensates the subject of his\nministrations. The effect of this will be to make many people fearful\nof having their arms broken who will never receive compensation for\nthat fear because their arms will not in fact be\nbroken.[19] Or\nif people are to be compensated simply for their fear,\nindividuals whose conduct induces fear may be required to make\ncompensation payments even though they never in fact break\nforearms. These sorts of problems are mitigated if the right not to\nhave one’s forearm broken is treated as a claim\nprotected by a property right.  The second factor that complicates recourse to due compensation for\nunconsented to boundary crossings is the fact that the best procedure\nfor identifying the due compensation for a crossing is to require\nantecedent negotiation with and consent by the party who will be\nsubject to the crossing (63–65). The best way to identify the\ndue compensation for A for having her forearm broken\nby B is to see what payment A will accept to\nallow B to break her arm. However, this requires\nthe prohibition of the boundary crossing under discussion\nunless the subject of the action agrees to it. When antecedent\nnegotiation between subject A and actor B is\nfeasible, the best route to due compensation for A (which is\nrequired under the liability rule construal of A’s right)\nconsists in treating A’s right against B’s proposed\naction as a claim that is protected by a property rule. Especially\nsince antecedent negotiation between subjects and actors is usually\nfeasible, even rights that are in themselves only protected by\nliability rules are usually to be treated as boundaries that may not\nwithout consent be crossed.  Nozick describes the task of identifying the compensation due\nto A for undergoing B’s chosen action as the task of\nidentifying the just division of the benefits generated\nby B’s action. B gains through his action; but\njustice requires that he share those gains\nwith A—especially since the immediate effect\nof B’s action is a loss for A. The just division of\nthe benefits is the division that A and B would\nsettle upon in conjunction with A’s agreement to be subject\nto the action in question. And the best procedure for identifying what\nterms would be settled upon is to require antecedent negotiation and\nconsent—when antecedent negotiation and consent is feasible. We can now return to Nozick’s core argument against the anarchist’s\nchallenge. Nozick calls for a three-fold distinction among agencies\nand individuals who operate outside of the dominant protective\nassociation. At one end of the spectrum are outlaw agencies or rogue\nindividuals who either aim to perform actions that cross boundaries\nor pose substantial risks of crossing boundaries through their\nrecklessness or negligence. The actions of such agencies or\nindividuals may simply be suppressed to protect the rights that they\nthreaten.[20]\nAt the other end of the spectrum are agencies or individuals who are\nknown to the dominant association to pursue rights protection in ways\nthat are not markedly more likely to violate the rights of the\nassociation’s clients than the procedures of the association is\nlikely to violate rights. Given its own procedures, the association\ncannot honestly proclaim that its clients have rights against the\nactivities of these well-behaved agencies and individuals. (But the\nassociation may know that they are well-behaved precisely through its\nmonitoring of those agencies and individuals.) In the middle of the\nspectrum are agencies and individuals whose procedures are not so\nrisky as to justify straight-forward prohibition but are risky enough\nso that those whose rights are threatened seem to have some\nrights-based justification for suppressing those procedures. According to Nozick, there would be no good answer to the question\nof how the dominant association should act toward agents in the middle\nof the spectrum if the association had to choose between\nstraight-forward suppression and securing the voluntary consent of\nthose agents to cease or modify their procedures. But, fortunately, an\nintermediate mode of action is available to the dominant association,\nviz., crossing the boundaries that protect those unacceptably risky\nprocedures while duly compensating the subjects of those\ncrossings.  It might be objected that either you have the right to forbid these\npeople’s risky activities or you don’t. If you do, you needn’t\ncompensate the people for doing to them what you have a right to do;\nand if you don’t … you ought simply to stop [the\nforbidding]… . But the dilemma, “either you have a right\nto forbid it so that you needn’t compensate, or you don’t have a right\nto forbid it so you should stop,” is too short. It may be that\nyou do have a right to forbid an action but only provided you\ncompensate those to whom it is forbidden. (83) Nozick’s crucial move against the anarchist depends, then, on\nconstruing the claims to non-interference of agents who engage in\nactions that pose moderate risk to others’ rights as claims that are\nmerely protected by liability rules. Since, they are merely protected\nby liability rules, those actions may be interfered with as long as\nthose subject to that interference are duly compensated.  Why, though, do the rights of those who pose moderate risk to\nothers’ rights not acquire the force of claims protected by property\nrules? With respect to the fear factor, Nozick seems simply to assume\nthat the dominant association’s measures to suppress or control the\nactivities of those moderately dangerous (but non-outlaw) agencies\nand individuals generate no complicating fear. With respect to the\ndivision of benefits factor, Nozick seems to hold that those who\nsuppress (or mitigate) risky conduct by others should not be thought\nof as thereby benefiting.  Presumably a mark of this is that\nit would be illicit for a previously fastidious independent\nprotective agency to shift to moderately risky procedures against the\ndominant association’s clients in order to sell to the association\nits return to fastidious\n conduct.[21]\nThus, there is no need for antecedent\nnegotiation to determine the just division of the benefits generated\nby the dominant association’s suppression or mitigation of the\nmoderately risky procedures of independent agencies or\nindividuals. Everything else being equal, it seems to follow that\nmoderately risky procedures by those independents may be suppressed\nor mitigated without any compensation. (Rather, it seems\nthat they can be suppressed or mitigated with due compensation; but\nthe due compensation is no compensation.) However, according to Nozick, everything else is not quite\nequal. Some of these independents (or agencies) may have adopted\nmoderately risky procedures because they (or their clients) cannot\nafford more fastidious procedures. According to Nozick, if we\nhad “a theory of disadvantage” (82), it would tell us that\nthese independents (or these clients) will be disadvantaged by the\ndominant association’s interference with those moderately risky\nprocedures. They will be disadvantaged even though they are only\nengaged in (or subscribing to) procedures that might infringe on\nothers’ rights. So, Nozick concludes, the suppression or mitigation of\nthe procedures engaged in (or subscribed to) by these individuals must\nbe accompanied by compensation for disadvantages imposed upon\nthem. Thus, we arrive at Nozick’s principle of\ncompensation:  \nthose who are disadvantaged by being forbidden to do actions\nthat only might harm others must be compensated for these\ndisadvantages foisted upon them in order to provide security for the\nothers. (82–3)  This principle of compensation explains (or expresses)\nthe justification for the dominant association stepping in to suppress\nor exercise mitigating control over the procedures of moderately risky\n(but non-outlaw) agencies and individuals.  How does the principle of compensation get us to the minimal state?\nAccording to Nozick, through its enforced oversight over others’\nprovision of protective services the association exercises enough of a\nmonopoly over the provision of those services to become\nan ultra-minimal state. However, under the principle of\ncompensation, the dominant association’s interference with moderately\nrisky independents who are disadvantaged by this interference will be\npermissible only if the association compensates those independents for\nthose disadvantages. Nozick envisions that compensation naturally\ntaking the form of the ultra-minimal state providing free or\nsubsidized protective services to those who will (otherwise) be\ndisadvantaged by its interferences.  When the ultra-minimal state\nsecures the permissibility of its monopoly oversight by providing free\nor subsidized protection to those who are (otherwise) disadvantaged by\nits oversight it becomes a (legitimate) minimal state.  In asserting the permissibility of its enforced oversight, the\ndominant association does not maintain that it has some unique claim\nto suppress or control moderately risky agencies or\nindividuals. Nevertheless, by being the dominant association, it alone\nis in position to act under the aegis of the principle of compensation\n(108–110). Nozick’s minimal state provides free or subsidized\nprotective services to some parties. To pay for those free or\nsubsidized services, the minimal state charges its paying customers\nmore than it otherwise would. This may appear to be enforced\nredistribution; but it is not. For, the additional charges incurred by\nthe minimal state’s paying clients simply are payments that are needed\nto fund compensation that must be paid if the oversight that is\nimposed on behalf of the clients’ security is to be permissible.  Nozick provides an important second argument on behalf of the\ndominant association’s monopolistic oversight and constraint of other\nprotective agencies. This argument focuses on procedural\nrights. Do the clients of the dominant association have (natural)\nprocedural rights against having moderately risky protective measures\ndirected against them? Nozick recognizes that it seems implausible to\naffirm procedural rights in the state of nature. Yet he seeks to back\ninto such rights by starting with the proposition that even in the\nstate of nature C acts wrongly and impermissibly\ntoward D if C extracts restitution payments\nfrom D or punishes D without knowing (or having a\nwell-justified belief) that D has violated C’s\nrights; C acts wrongly and impermissibly even if D\nhas in fact violated those rights and the restitution or punishment\nimposed by C is appropriate for that violation (106). Nozick\ntakes the wrongness and impermissibility of C’s\nepistemically ill-grounded reaction to justify the prohibition\nof C’s action against the guilty D. So D\nhas at least the equivalent of a procedural right\nagainst C’s epistemically ill-grounded conduct (107). The\ndominant association can permissibly rise to statehood by enforcing\nits clients’ (equivalent of) procedural rights against those\nmoderately risky\n competitors.[22]\nThe problem here seems to be that, if\nsaying that C’s ill-grounded reaction is\n“impermissible” is merely another way of saying that it\nis morally defective, one cannot infer from its impermissibility that\nit may be prohibited. It seems that one can only infer\nthat C’s reaction may be prohibited if that reaction is\nimpermissible in the much stronger sense of being (equivalent to)\nrights-violating. But one cannot assert that the reaction is\nimpermissible in this stronger sense unless one already assumes what\nNozick is purporting to show, viz., that there is a procedural right\n(or something equivalent to such a right) that the ill-grounded\nreaction violates.  We have already noted that Nozick’s minimal state differs from\ncommon depictions of the minimal state because it does not impose\ntaxation to finance its services. In many other ways as well, it is\nmore like a business enterprise than a state. There are no rulers, no\nlegislative body, no political elections, no contending parties and\ncitizens. There is no sovereignty and no state territory. There are,\ninstead, executives, a board of directors, shareholders, clients, and\nthe assets of the enterprise. But the fly in the enterprise ointment\nis the absence of competitive market constraints on the price or the\nquality of the services offered by this monopoly. (If there is enough\nmarket competition to keep prices of protective services down and\ntheir quality up, there will be too much competition for this\nenterprise to count as a state.) It appears that the only other way to\nkeep this monopoly in check would be through some sort of\npolitical-constitutional constraints.  However, Nozick makes no\nmention of these. Of course, a protective association in pursuit of\ncustomers might commit itself to constitution-like\nconstraints on its decisions and conduct as a way of reassuring\npotential clients. (Mack 2018 110-124) It is striking that a more direct route to a more conventional\nminimal state—i.e., one that would fund the production of rights\nprotection through taxes—is available to Nozick. (Mack 2011) That\nroute is opened by his shift to the liability rule construal of\nrights. On that construal each individual’s right to her financial\nassets is at base merely a right to receive due compensation for the\nseizure of those assets. So, if the dominant association taxes\nindividuals—seizes some of their financial assets without their\nconsent—but provides compensating benefits for each of those\nindividuals in the form of protective services, the association’s\nconduct will be perfectly permissible. On Nozick’s view, such\nnon-negotiated accompanying compensation will be inferior to\nantecedently negotiated terms of exchange if such prior\nnegotiation would have been feasible. However, Nozick could have\nadvanced the common argument that such prior negotiation of payment\nfor protective services would not be feasible. That argument turns on the special public good feature of a system\nof rights protection, viz., that, if such a good is produced, if will\nbe difficult to exclude individuals who do not voluntarily pay for\nthat system from enjoying (many of) the benefits generated by the\nsystem. Perhaps the police whom I have not voluntarily paid won’t\nrespond to my calls for assistance. But they will respond to\nthe calls of my paying neighbors and, as a result, I will enjoy a\nlower level of neighborhood crime. Accordingly, antecedent\nnegotiations about payment for protection will not be feasible\nbecause a significant number of individuals would decline to offer\npayment in the hope that they would to get (most of) the benefits of\nthe production of those services even if they do not contract for\nthem.[23]\nHence, assuming that the taxation to fund the public good of rights\nprotection is not itself feared, the rights to the financial assets\nthat are seized in that taxation remain claims that are merely\nprotected by liability rules. According to his argument, since the provision of that protection\nduly compensates for the seizures, the imposition of those taxes is\npermissible.[24] One strand that runs throughout ASU is Nozick’s interest\nin invisible-hand explanations—explanations of complex orders\nlike the adjustment of supply and demand in market economies that do\nnot appeal to anyone’s intention to bring about the explained order\n(18–22). For Nozick, part of the charm of his story about the\nemergence of the minimal state is that it is an invisible hand\nstory. The dominant association backs into being a state without\nreally trying (to be a state) (118–119). This contrasts with the\nvisible hand quality of social contract explanations or justifications\nof the state. Of course, no actual minimal state is explained\nor justified by Nozick’s invisible hand explanation. This is no\nphilosophical problem because there is no actual minimal state that\nNozick sets out to justify.  However, Nozick does seem to be committed to the view that the\nlegitimacy of any actual minimal state that might arise will depend\nupon its having arisen through permissible, rights respecting\nactivities; and this seems to be a problem. Consider a minimal state\nthat comes into existence when some aggressive individuals seize\ncontrol of a powerful coercive apparatus that has been built up\nthrough many years of murder and plunder but then immediately undergo\nconversion into conscientious libertarians. As quickly as they can\nthose individuals redirect the coercive power at their disposal from\naggressions against life, liberty, and property to the suppression of\nrights violations by non-violating means. It seems that our judgment\nabout the legitimacy of this minimal state should turn at least\nprimarily on how it now conducts itself and not on the permissibility\nof the actions that lead to its existence (Paul 1979). A new angle on this topic is presented in Ralf Bader’s ingenious explanation of how Nozick’s account of the way in which minimal states would arise without violating rights supports a demand in justice that actual more-than-minimal states be transformed into minimal states. (Bader 2017) The key is Bader’s idea that the rectification of economic injustice and the rectification of (what might be called) political justice are isomorphic. Economic rectification requires the transition from an array of holdings that is at least in part the product of rights violations to the array of holdings that would have arisen had holdings arisen justly. In parallel fashion, political rectification requires the transition from political institutions that are at least in part the product of rights violations to the political institutions that would have arisen had political institutions arisen justly. Nozick’s counterfactual account of the minimal state reveals that this is sort of political institution into which actual more-than-minimal states must, as a matter of justice, be transformed. While the core official purpose of Part I of ASU is the\ndefense of the minimal state against the anarchist critique, the core\nofficial purpose of Part II of ASU, is to argue that\n“no more extensive state can be justified” (xi). In\nchapter 8 of Part II, “Equality, Envy, Exploitation,\nEtc.”, Nozick seeks to counter the force of a series of\nconsiderations that are invoked on behalf of a more extensive\nstate. These include equality, equal opportunity, meaningful work,\nworkers’ control, and exploitation. In chapter 9 of part II,\n“Demoktesis”, he constructs an invisible hand account of\nthe rise of an unconstrained democratic state. The intention seems to\nbe to undercut the appeal of such a state by showing what sorts of\nunattractive, albeit permissible, actions individuals would have to\nengage in to arrive at such a state. Nozick needs, then, to explain\nwhy a hypothetical invisible hand explanation of the minimal state\nmuch more legitimates it than a hypothetical invisible hand\nexplanation of the unconstrained democratic state legitimates it\n(292–294).  Still, by far the most philosophically important chapter of Part II\nis chapter 7, “Distributive Justice” in which Nozick seeks\nto counter the view that a more extensive state is justified as an\ninstrument of distributive justice. This chapter has been the subject\nof the bulk of the philosophical commentary on ASU. In this\nchapter, Nozick sketches his “historical entitlement”\nconception of justice in holdings, provides a number of quite general\narguments against all alternative conceptions of justice in holdings,\nendorses a Lockean Proviso that adds a bit of complexity to the\nentitlement doctrine, and provides a powerful critique of Rawls’ case\nin A Theory of Justice for his strongly redistributive\n“difference principle”. This section focuses on the first\nthree of these topics. Nozick’s approach to justice in holdings has to be seen as emerging\nfrom his broad construal of the implications of the Rawlsian-Nozickean\ncritique of utilitarianism. Whereas Rawls concludes that a due respect\nfor the separateness of persons precludes imposing losses on\nindividuals for the sake of the general welfare, Nozick concludes that\nit precludes imposing losses upon individuals for the sake\nof any conception of the overall social good—including\ndeeply distribution-sensitive conceptions. The justice of a given\nindividual’s possession of and discretionary control over certain\neconomic goods cannot be a function of that possession and control\ncontributing to the general welfare or to any other overall\nsocial end-state or pattern. All such consequentialist assessments of\nholdings are ruled out of court.  So, if there is any acceptable\naccount of the justice of individual holdings, it must be a\nbackward-looking account. The justification must depend upon how the\nholdings in question have arisen.  If the holding came about by permissible and title-conferring modes\nof action, the possessor will be entitled to it. If the holding came\nabout by modes of action that are not permissible (or are permissible\nbut not title-conferring) the possessor will not be entitled to\nit. Thus, entitlements are historical. Individual A will have\nan entitlement to holding H if and only if A’s\npossession of H has the right sort of history. This stance\naccords with the common-sense intuition that an agent’s acquiring\neconomically valuable objects in certain ways—e.g., creating\nthose objects out of unowned natural materials—generates\nentitlements for that agent over those objects while an agent’s\nacquiring objects in other ways—e.g., seizing those objects from\nanother who has created them out of unowned natural\nmaterials—does not generate entitlements for that agent over\nthose objects. A distribution of holdings across individuals will be\njust insofar as the particular holdings that constitute that\ndistribution are just—rather than the justice of any particular\nindividual’s holding depending on the holistic justice of the\ndistribution of which it is a part. Just acquisition takes the form of just initial acquisition, just\ntransfer, or just rectification of an unjust taking. An existing\nholding will be just if it arises from an act of just initial\nacquisition or an act of just initial acquisition followed by one or\nmore acts of just transfer, or an act of just rectification that\ncounteracts an unjust taking of a just holding. An adequate theory of\njustice in holdings will specify the processes that constitute just\ninitial acquisitions, just transfers, and just acts of\nrectification. Nozick tells us that each of these principles is a\n“complicated truth” (150) that he will not attempt to\nformulate. Thus, we never get statements from Nozick of what specific\ninitial acquisition or transfer or rectification processes that result\nin agent C’s possession of H generate or convey\nto C an entitlement over H. Nozick never\ndirectly seeks to explain why certain specific processes—certain\nspecific means of acquisition—have the power to generate or\nconvey entitlements. He never addresses the ways in which historical contingency and convention may select (from among morally eligible procedures) the specific procedures that count as entitlement conferring within a given society. (Mack 2010 and Bryan 2017) Nozick’s lack of specification and explanation has mislead\ncommentators such as Cohen into thinking that, for Nozick, any not\nunjust process that results in C’s possession\nof H generates or conveys an entitlement for C\nover H. “’[J]ust steps, for Nozick, are human\nactions that are free of injustice…” (Cohen 1995:\n39). Consider Cohen’s example of D’s rolling pin accidentally\nrolling downhill from D’s kitchen into C’s kitchen\nwhere C innocently mistakes it for his long-lost rolling\npin. Cohen thinks that, since nothing within this transfer process is\nunjust, Nozick is committed to the transfer being just and entitlement\nconveying and, hence, is committed to the implausible conclusion\nthat C would acquire a just claim to the rolling\npin. Although this sort of criticism rests on the mistaken idea that,\nfor Nozick, just processes are simply not unjust processes, it does\nhighlight how little Nozick does offer in the way of a positive\naccount of the nature and power of entitlement generating or conveying\nprocesses.  Nozick thinks we are pushed to adopt some set of\nhistorical entitlement principles by the dethronement of\nconsequentialist doctrines of justice in holdings; and he then\nimplicitly relies on his readers’ intuitions about what the content of\nthose principles will be. Such intuitions will, e.g., count against\nthe thought that one can engage in the initial just acquisition\nof H by wanting H or by intensely focusing one’s\nattention on H and will support the thought that some sort of\nphysical engagement with unowned materials is necessary for acquiring\nan entitlement to them. Similarly, such intuitions will count against\nthe thought that an accidental transfer of a rolling pin\nfrom D’s kitchen to C’s kitchen will convey the\nright to the pin from D to C and will support the\nthought that such a conveyance requires some sort of informed and\nvoluntary interaction between D and C. Nozick discerns two types of principles concerning justice in\nholdings other than the historical entitlement type. These are\nend-state principles and patterned principles. To a considerable\nextent, Nozick’s argument on behalf of his historical entitlement\napproach consists in his critiques of end-state and patterned\ndoctrines. End-state principles hold that justice in the distribution\nof income (or economically valuable goods) is a matter of some\narithmetical feature of one of the available distributions.  Consider\nthree available distributions of income among three individuals (or\namong three positions to be occupied by individuals): A utilitarian (or income maximization) theory will\nselect D2 as the just distribution on the ground\nthat it has the greatest total income. An egalitarian theory will\nselect D1 as the just distribution on the ground\nthat it is the most equal distribution. Rawls’ difference principle\nwill select D1 on the distinct ground that within\nit the lowest payoff is greater than the lowest payoff within any\nother available distribution. What makes each of these doctrines an\nend-state view is their shared conviction that the information\nprovided by this sort of matrix is sufficient for determining which of\nthe available distributions is the just one.  According to Nozick, a major problem for all end-state doctrines is\nprecisely the falsity of this shared conviction. For surely\ninformation that cannot appear within such a matrix is essential to a\nsensible judgment about which of these available distributions is\njust. Consider, e.g., the following information.\nD2 is the distribution of income that obtains when\nA is enslaved to B who employs C as his\neffective overseer. D1 is the distribution that\nobtains when A is partially emancipated and is only subject\nto slavery-like exploitation by B and C one week per\nmonth. And D3 is the distribution that obtains\nwhen A is entirely emancipated. Given the obvious relevance\nof this sort of information for any responsible selection of one of\nthese distributions as the just one, any doctrine that asserts or\npresumes that the information available in the matrix suffices has to\nbe deeply flawed.  Patterned theories of distributive justice escape this problem\nbecause they hold that the just distribution is the available\ndistribution in which the income accorded to individuals most tracks\nsome feature of those individuals—e.g., their moral desert or\ntheir economic effort—and the incidence of that feature is not\nreported in that income matrix. Hence, one cannot say which of the\ndistributions presented in the above table is to be selected until one\nalso knows what the distribution of the to-be-tracked feature is\namong A, B, and C. In addition, plausible\npatterned doctrines will focus on features of individuals that are\nhistorical—e.g., how much moral desert particular individuals\nhave amassed or how much economic effort they have evinced. So,\nplausible patterned doctrines will be historical. However, unlike\nhistorical entitlement doctrines, historical patterned theories will\nnot determine the justice of the particular holdings of individuals on\nthe basis of whether those individuals acquired those holdings through\nentitlement generating or conveying processes. Nozick offers a series of arguments each of which is supposed to\ndiscredit all (non-trivial) end-state and patterned principles.  (At\nthis point, Nozick employs the term “patterned” to refer\nboth to end-state principles and track-the-feature principles.) We\nmust focus here on two of those arguments.  The first, most famous,\nand most misunderstood of these arguments appears in the section\nof ASU that is entitled “How Liberty Upsets\nPatterns” (160–164). The second appears in the section\nentitled “Redistribution and Property Rights”\n(167–174). In “How Liberty Upsets Patterns”, Nozick asks each of\nhis readers to envision an income distribution that accords with her\nfavorite patterning principle. Then Nozick points out that more or\nless as soon as that pattern P1 is instituted,\nindividuals will engage in highly innocuous dispositions of what has\nbeen assigned to them in the name of justice that will engender a\ndifferent pattern P2. For instance, a million\nfans will each pay Wilt Chamberlain 25 cents to see him play\nbasketball. However, this new pattern P2 will\nalmost certainly be convertible through fine-tuned social engineering\ninto another pattern P3 that better realizes the\nfavored patterning principle. Imagine, e.g., that the $250,000 that\nis concentrated in Wilt’s hands within P2 can be\neffectively redistributed downward whereas it could not be\neffectively redistributed downward when it was still spread out among\nWilt’s moderately prosperous fans.  Thus, if we continue to assess\ndistributions on the basis of the selected patterning principle, we\nwill have to declare P2 to be unjust and maintain\nthat justice requires its conversion\ninto P3. And, more or less as soon\nas P3 is instituted, individuals will engage in\nhighly innocuous dispositions of what has just been assigned to them\nin the name of renewed justice that will engender a different\npattern P4 … and so on. Nozick then\nidentified two problems with this continued application of the\nfavored patterned rule. This first problem is that, if (as stipulated) the holdings of\nindividuals under P1 were just and if (as\nstipulated) interactions that converted P1\ninto P2 were all just, it is difficult to see\nhow P2 can become infected with injustice. Of\ncourse, P2 (almost certainly) must be judged to be\nunjust if one continues to assess the justice of distributions on the\nbasis of the adopted patterned principle. But it seems reasonable to\ndemand an explanation of how that asserted injustice could\nhave entered P2 given the justice\nof P1 and of the processes through\nwhich P2 emerges\nfrom P1.   By what process could\nsuch a transfer among two persons give rise to a legitimate claim of\ndistributive justice on a portion of what was transferred, by a third\nparty who has no claim of justice on any holding of the\nothers before the transfer? (161–2)  It does not seem to be a sufficient answer to say that\ninjustice must have entered in P2 because, after\nall, when we apply the operative distributive principle\nto P2 we reach the conclusion\nthat P2 is unjust. The second problem is that the endorsement of redistributive\ninterference with the outcomes of persons’ innocuous deployments of\ntheir assigned holdings seems to be inconsistent with the justice of\nthat assignment of holdings. For surely one may dispose as one chooses\nof one’s just holdings as long as one does not unjustly impinge upon\nothers and their just holdings. \nIf the people were entitled to dispose of the resources to which they\nwere entitled (under D1), didn’t this include\ntheir being entitled to give it to, or exchange it with Wilt\nChamberlain? (161)  To endorse redistributive interference with the\noutcomes of persons’ non-impinging dispositions of the holdings that\nhave been assigned to them seems to rescind the justice of that\nassignment of holdings. \nPatterned distributional principles do not give people what\nentitlement principles do, only better distributed. They do not give\nthe right to choose what to do with what one has… (167)  This aspect of Nozick’s critique is nicely summed up\nin Hillel Steiner’s quip that patterned theories of justice\n“create rights to interfere with the rights that they have\ncreated” (Steiner 1977:\n 43).[25] It is important to note that the problems that Nozick’s identifies\nare problems internal to the ongoing application of any\npatterned principle. Nozick should not be read as making the\nquestion-begging external argument that, since conforming to liberty\nis the standard by which theories of justice in holdings should be\nassessed and patterned theories often call for interferences with\nliberty, patterned theories must be dismissed. Nevertheless, Nozick\nbears considerable responsibility for this reading when he\nsays,  \nThe general point… is that no end-state principle or\ndistributional patterned principle of justice can be continually\nrealized without continuous interference with people’s\nlives. (163)  Nor should Nozick be pictured as holding that the\nproblem with patterned theories is that they would forbid any\ndeparture from a P1 that is instituted because, at\nthe time it is instituted, it is the available distribution that best\nrealizes some favored pattern. Nozick is not charging patterning\ntheorists with forbidding the exchange between Wilt and his fans. An important response to Nozick’s “How Liberty Upsets\nPatterns” arguments is that they rely upon a mistaken picture of\nthe patterned theorist’s program. According to this response, Nozick\nrepresents the patterned theorist as aiming at the daily (or weekly or\nmonthly) fullest available realization of her favorite pattern. On\nthis representation, at the end of each day (or week or month) the\nadvocate of, e.g., the Rawlsian difference principle will determine\nwhether the existing distribution can be transformed into one that\nprovides a higher income for those in the lowest income positions for\nthe next day (or week or month); if such a transformation is available\nthen (on this representation) the difference principle advocate will\nrequire it as a matter of justice. Hence, the continuous interference\nin the name of justice with the results of people acting as they\nchoose with their purported just holdings. However, the advocate of\nthe difference principle will maintain that this principle guides the\ndesign of the basic institutional structure of society; it provides\nthe basic structure with the aim of raising the lifetime income of the\nrepresentative lowest income individual as much as possible. What is\nassigned to individuals as a matter of distributive justice is a\nlifetime stream of income that arises through some combination of\npermitted and protected modes of income acquisition, tax and\nregulatory structures, and tax-funded assistance. Wilt does not have a\nclaim in justice to his holdings on the day before the fans transfer\n$250,000 to him or to his holdings on the following day. He has a\nclaim in justice to the lifetime income that will accrue to him when a\nbasic structure is in place which, through enabling income\nacquisition, taxing, regulating, and subsidizing income yields\n(something like) the highest possible lifetime income for the least\nadvantaged. That claim in justice is not violated when the IRS seizes,\nsay, 70% of his $250,000 windfall. Hence, in his most direct response to Nozick’s challenge, Rawls\ndeclares, There are no unannounced and unpredictable interferences\nwith citizens’ expectations and acquisitions. Entitlements are earned,\nand honored as the public system declares.  Taxes and\nrestrictions are all in principle foreseeable, and holdings\nare acquired on the known condition that certain transfers\nand redistributions will be made. (Rawls 1993: 283, emphasis\nadded) It would seem, however, that Nozick can insist that any ongoing\nattempt to maximize lifetime incomes for the worst off (or to sustain\nany other non-trivial pattern) will require unannounced and\nunpredictable interferences with citizens’ expectations and\nacquisitions. For, as economic preferences, needs, opportunities,\nbeliefs, insights, and capacities change in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways, the public system will similarly have to change if\nit is going to continue to aim at maximizing lifetime incomes for the\nworst off. And as further unannounced and unpredictable changes occur,\nthe basic structure will again have to be changed in unannounced and\nunpredictable ways. As Rawls himself says, “… even in a\nwell-ordered society, adjustments in the basic structure are always\nnecessary” (Rawls 1993: 284, Mack 2018: 124-129). The institution of those\nadjustments will almost certainly have to dishonor some of the\nentitlements proclaimed under the previous public system and treat\nsome of people’s previously earned holdings to previously unannounced\nand unpredictable transfers and redistributions (Mack 2002a,\n85–91). In “Redistribution and Property Rights” Nozick offers a\nmore external argument against all patterned theories of justice.  The\nargument is that the institutional operation of any (non-trivial)\npatterned doctrine amounts to the institution of partial ownership of\nsome people by other people.  Whether it is done through taxation on wages or on wages over a\ncertain amount, or through seizure of profits, or through there being\na big social pot so that it’s not clear what’s coming from where and\nwhat’s going where, patterned principles of distributive justice\ninvolve appropriating the actions of other persons. Seizing the\nresults of someone’s labor is equivalent to seizing hours from him and\ndirecting him to carry on various activities… . This process\n… makes [those who carry it out] a part-owner of you; it gives\nthem a property right in you. Just as having such partial control and\npower of decision, by right, over an animal or inanimate object would\nbe to have a property right in it. (172) Nozick distances himself from a Lockean labor-mixing account of\njust initial holdings by jokingly asking whether one comes to own the\nocean by pouring one’s can of tomato juice into it (175). And, in the\npassage above, he carefully avoids saying that the operation of any\npatterned doctrine infringes upon one’s self-ownership by way of\nappropriating one’s labor.  Nevertheless, the argument in this passage seems to be quite\nLockean in its basic structure. Rather than focusing on particular\nexpropriations of this or that labor infused object, the argument\nattends to the configuration of control over individuals’ actions,\ntime, and decisions that the institution of any (non-trivial)\ndistributive pattern will require. According to Nozick, such a\nconfiguration of control wrongly treats the individuals who are\nsubject to it without their consent as though they are in part the\nproperty of those who establish and exercise that control. Note that\neven here Nozick does not seem to be proposing specific content for\nthe principles of just initial acquisition and just transfer. Rather,\nthe goal is to provide a general vindication of the historical\nentitlement approach by undercutting the end-state and patterned\napproaches. Nozick follows Locke in adopting a version of the claim that an\nindividual will have a complaint in justice against otherwise\nperfectly just acquisitions by others if those acquisitions do not\nleave that individual with “enough, and as good”\n(174–182). Although Nozick’s discussion of his Lockean proviso\nis somewhat murky, we can identify three important features of that\nproviso doctrine.  First, whether an individual has a complaint under Nozick’s Lockean\nproviso will not be a matter of whether too little natural material\nhas been left in common by others or too little material has been left\nfor that individual to initially acquire. Rather, that individual will\nhave a just complaint against others’ acquisitions if and only if\nthose acquisitions leave her on net worse off in terms of utility or\nwelfare. The individual will have no just complaint even if her\nutility or welfare is diminished by a decrease in what remains in\ncommon or a decrease in what remains available for her initial\nacquisition as long as she is duly compensated in terms of utility or\nwelfare by other effects of the acquisitive actions of\nothers. The claim at the core of Nozick’s “enough, and as good” proviso is only protected by\na liability rule. Second, in his main discussion of it, Nozick maintains that this\nproviso is readily satisfied in free market\neconomies.[26]\nThis is in part due to the strong tendency of the rising tide of such\neconomies to raise up all those who are willing to swim with it\n(177). It is also in part due to the low baseline set by the\nproviso. Nozick never carefully spells out that baseline. But it must\nbe something like how well off the individual under consideration\nwould have been had all natural stuff remained in the common or,\nperhaps, how well off that individual would be (over his lifetime)\nwere all natural stuff (or even all owned stuff) now returned to the\ncommon.  Third, the proviso adds “an additional bit of complexity\ninto the structure of the entitlement theory” (174). It\nspecifies a way in which things could go especially badly for an\nindividual even if the acquisitions of others are entirely in accord\nwith the principles of justice in acquisition and it asserts that\nindividuals would have a complaint in justice should things go that\nbadly for them in that way. For Nozick, the primary case for the\njustice of any holding continues to turn on its having arisen through\nprocesses that accord with the principles of just initial acquisition,\njust transfer, and (if relevant) just rectification. (This is why it\nis such a serious problem that Nozick never spells out those\nprinciples and never explains why acquisition in accordance with them\nhas the power to engender or convey entitlements.) For Nozick, even if\nthe proviso is violated, those who have acquired justly do not have to\nsurrender their holdings—albeit they need to provide\ncompensation to those whose situations are on net worsened by the\nexisting system of holdings.[27] Nozick recognizes that even in relatively free societies the\nhistorical processes that have yielded existing holdings have been\nshot through with injustices. The history of almost all existing\nholdings includes lots of appropriation by way of murder, plunder,\nenslavement, fraudulent dealings, and other illicit coercive\ntransfers (usually on behalf of the rich and powerful). We do not\nneed a delicately worked out theory of rectification in order to\nsay that, if A has grabbed B’s goat yesterday, he\ncan be required to return it to B today. But we do need a\nhighly elaborate theory to inform us about what rectification\npayments (if any) should now be required of whom on behalf of who\nelse because of injustices performed 20 or 50 or 200 years ago.\nPresumably any acceptable doctrine will require that only current\nvictims of past injustices have just claims to rectification payments\nand that they only have just claims against current beneficiaries of\nthose past injustices. Perhaps, then, bygones should be treated as\nbygones when we lack the information that a well-developed \ndoctrine of rectification would require us to have to justly rectify long past injustices.[28] Nozick closes chapter 7 with two thoughts concerning\nrectification. The first is that proper rectification may have to take\nthe form of rough and ready payments to classes of people whose\nmembers are likely to be worse off than they otherwise would be\nbecause of historical injustices—payments that would be funded\nby taxes upon classes of people whose members are likely to be better\noff than they otherwise would be because of those historical\ninjustices.  The second is that some end-state principle might come\ninto play as a guide for these required payments—albeit\n“it may well be implausible” (231) to select the\ndifference principle as this guide. The official purpose of Part III of ASU,\n“Utopia”, is to show that the minimal state is not merely\nlegitimate and just; it is also inspiring. This purpose is advanced by\nsketching a framework for utopia that is inspiring and noting that\nthis framework is highly akin to—Nozick actually says\n“equivalent to” (333)—the minimal state. Yet Nozick\nalso says that the framework might not have any “central\nauthority” (329). Still, the framework is akin to the minimal\nstate because it is an institutional structure that enforces peaceful\nco-existence among voluntarily formed communities. It protects the\nindependence of such communities and their freedom to recruit members\nand also protects the liberty of individuals to enter and exit\ncommunities as they respectively choose. Although Nozick is not\nexplicit about this, we have to presume that the framework enforces\nthe same norms of personal freedom, property, and contractual\ncompliance that the minimal state enforces except insofar as\nindividuals voluntarily relinquish such rights within the communities\nthey enter. The framework is inspiring because of the way it contributes to\npersons’ identification of and participation in communities (and other\nnetworks of relationships) through which they will find meaning and\nwell-being. It is inspiring to anyone who appreciates how little each\nof us knows about what sorts of communities best suit human beings in\nall their depth and diversity and how much the operation of the\nframework assists individuals in their discovery of and engagement in\ncommunities that enhance their respective well-being.  Moreover, many\npersons may value the framework not merely for the way it enhances\ntheir own good but, also, for the ways in which it allows them to\nparticipate vicariously in others’ achievement of their different\nmodes of flourishing (Lomasky 2002). The framework is—or, more precisely, sustains—a\ndiscovery procedure. Under the protective umbrella of the framework,\nindividuals are presented with and can try out diverse communities\nwhile communities themselves arise and modify themselves in their\ncompetitive search to sustain, improve, or increase their\nmembership. A wide range of communities will continually arise out of\nand in response to the evolving perceptions that diverse individuals\nwill have about what modes of sociality will best suit them and will\nbest attract welcome partners. Communities will survive and perhaps\nexpand or be imitated insofar as they actually embody modes of\nrelationship that serve well their actual or prospective membership or\ninsofar as they successfully refine their offerings in the market\nplace of communities. The framework also insures that those who are\nalready confident that they know what sort of community is best for\nthem will be free to form those communities by voluntary subscription\nand, thereby, to manifest their actual value (or disvalue) to\nthemselves and to other seekers of well-being. Part of Nozick’s sub-text here is a message to socialist utopians\nthat nothing in the framework (or the minimal state) precludes their\nnon-coercive pursuit of their ideal communities. How, therefore, can\nsocialists object to the framework (or the minimal state)? This\ngeneralizes Nozick’s earlier claims in ASU that that\nadvocates of meaningful work and workers’ control of productive\nenterprises ought not to be hostile to the minimal state since the\nminimal state is fully tolerant of non-coercive endeavors to establish\nsuch conditions (246–253). In a short essay in Reason magazine published four years\nafter ASU, Nozick asked, “Who Would Choose\nSocialism?” (Nozick 1978). More precisely, his question was:\nWhat percent of the adult population would choose “to\nparticipate in socialist interpersonal relations of equality and\ncommunity” were they in position to choose between “a\nreasonably attractive socialist option and also a reasonably\nattractive non-socialist one?” (Nozick 1978: 277). Nozick takes\nthe choice available to Israelis between membership and non-membership\nin kibbutzim to be a good instance of a choice between such options\nand notes that around six percent of the adult population of Israel in\nthe 1970s had chosen the socialist option. He speculates that\nsocialists are at least “tempted” to be imperialists\nprecisely because they sense that there will be too few volunteers\n(Nozick 1978: 279). The discovery procedure that the framework sustains is a version of\nMillian experiments in living—albeit it is a version that places\nmuch more emphasis on the role of a marketplace of communities in\nproviding individuals with experimental options. This discovery\nprocedure (like Millian experiments in living) is, of course, a\nHayekian invisible hand process. Given the enormous diversity among\nindividuals, we do not know what one form of community would be\nbest. The idea that there is one best composite answer to all of these\nquestions [about what features utopia has], one best society for\neveryone to live in, seems to me to be an incredible one. (And the\nidea that, if there is one, we now know enough to describe it is even\nmore incredible.) (311) Nor do we know what distinct modes of community would be best for\ndistinct types of persons. Thus, we cannot design an inclusive utopia;\nnor can we design an array of mini-utopia such that some significantly\nfulfilling community will be available to everyone—or even to\nmost.  It is helpful to imagine cavemen sitting together to think up what,\nfor all time, will be the best possible society and then setting out\nto institute it. Do none of the reasons that make you smile at this\napply to us? (313–314) Given our ignorance, the best way to realize utopia—almost\ncertainly many distinct utopia—is through the discovery\nprocedure that the framework sustains. (We should note, however, an\nimplicit, somewhat puzzling, and wholly unnecessary presupposition of\nNozick’s discussion, viz, that individuals with utopian aspirations\nwill generally seek out communities that are made up of other\nindividuals like themselves. The suggestion is that chosen communities\nwill be internally homogeneous with heterogeneity existing only across\nthese communities.) The role of the framework in sustaining a discovery procedure\nbrings us to the second main purpose of “Utopia”. This is\nthe provision of an independent vindication of the minimal\nstate—one that specifically does not depend on “the moral\narguments for individual liberty” (309 footnote*) offered in Parts I\nand II of Anarchy, State, and Utopia. Although the activities\nof the framework are described in terms of protecting the rights that\nare affirmed in early parts of the book, the utopian advocacy of the\nframework does not rely upon the validity of those rights. Rather,\nthat advocacy turns on a general endorsement of utopian aspiration\ncombined with the core epistemic claim that, given our ignorance, the\nonly sensible route to utopia is the discovery procedure that the\nframework sustains. There is, however, an apparent problem with Nozick’s independence\nclaim. Nozick distinguishes among three sorts of utopians. There are\n“existential utopians” who have a particular utopia in\nmind for themselves and others who will be drawn to it but have no\nproblem with yet others being drawn to different utopia. There are\n“missionary utopians” who hope “to persuade or\nconvince everyone to live in one particular kind of community, but\nwill not force them to do so”. And there are\n“imperialistic utopians” who countenance “the\nforcing of everyone into one pattern of community”\n(319–320).  While existential utopians will embrace the\nframework and missionary utopians will (less heartily) support it,\nimperialistic “will oppose the framework as long as some others\ndo not agree with them” (320). Nozick’s response to the\nimperialist is to say “Well you can’t satisfy everyone,\nespecially if there are those who will be dissatisfied unless not\neverybody is satisfied” (320). The suggestion—never\nexplicitly stated by Nozick—is that the imperialist pursuit of\nutopia is to be suppressed by the framework precisely because it\nis impermissibly coercive. But, if so, the justification for\nthis crucial operation of the framework must appeal to some of\n“the moral arguments for individual liberty” from which\nNozick wants his utopia argument to be independent. However, Nozick may be able to escape from this problem by\nemphasizing that imperialists are being excluded on epistemic rather\nthan moral grounds. The question is, on what procedures will\nepistemically sensible utopians—utopians with a due appreciation\nfor the difficulties involved in identifying and instituting\nutopia—converge? And the answer is, on the processes of\nvoluntary association and dissociation and adjustment that the\nframework aims to sustain. Imperialist utopian coercion is simply not\npart of the process that all utopians have reason to favor because of\nits epistemic fecundity. Moreover, the operation of the framework does\nnot preclude the establishment—for some people or for\nall—of the mode of community favored by any\nutopian. \nSince any particular community may be established within the\nframework, it is compatible with all particular utopian visions, while\nguaranteeing none. (320)  Any utopian who wants her (current) vision to be guaranteed by\nbeing forced upon others has good epistemic reasons to shed that\ndesire. Still, it might be maintained that the most informative discovery\nprocedure is one that embodies no-holds-barred competition among\ncommunities. For surely we want to know which communities or\nassociations of communities, if any, will be capable of defending\nthemselves against the imperialists. Since it seems that the most\ninformative discovery procedure would not exclude imperialist\nutopians, it seems that the real basis for the exclusion of\nimperialists must be moral. Hence, it appears that their exclusion\ndoes undercut Nozick’s goal of providing an independent vindication of\nthe minimal state. However, this problem also may be just a matter of appearance.\nAfter all, the framework proposed by Nozick does not exclude\nimperialists in the sense of stipulating their non-existence.  Rather,\none of the core roles of the framework is precisely to protect\nnon-imperialists and their voluntary modes of association and\ndissociation from those epistemically short-sighted, albeit still\nexisting, imperialists. The operation of the framework should,\ntherefore, be seen as a two-level discovery procedure. On one level it\noperates as Nozick explicitly describes—as a competitive market\nplace of communities serving individuals who are becoming more\ninformed about their taste for community. However, on another level,\nthe operation of the framework is a procedure through which\nnon-imperialist communities and non-imperialist individuals who do not\nenter any utopian community discover how, if at all, they can\ncooperate in maintaining and operating the framework so as to protect\nthemselves and their epistemic quest from the imperialists.","contact.mail":"emack@tulane.edu","contact.domain":"tulane.edu"}]
