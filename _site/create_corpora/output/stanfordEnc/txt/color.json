One of\nthe most important reasons is that color raises serious metaphysical\nissues, concerning the nature both of physical reality and of the\nmind. Among these issues are questions concerning whether color is\npart of a mind-independent reality, and what account we can give of\nexperiences of color. These issues have been, and continue to be,\ninextricably linked with important epistemological and semantic\nissues. \n\nIn this section, we consider some central puzzles that arise in the\nphilosophy of color, concerning the nature of colors and how they fit\ninto scientific accounts of the world. \nThe visual world, the world as we see it, is a world populated by\ncolored objects. Typically, we see the world as having a rich tapestry\nof colors or colored forms—fields, mountains, oceans, skies,\nhairstyles, clothing, fruit, plants, animals, buildings, and so on.\nColors are important in both identifying objects, i.e., in locating\nthem in space, and in re-identifying them. So much of our perception\nof physical things involves our identifying objects by their\nappearance, and colors are typically essential to an object’s\nappearance, that any account of visual perception must contain some\naccount of colors. Since visual perception is one of the most\nimportant species of perception and hence of our acquisition of\nknowledge of the physical world, and of our environment, including our\nown bodies, a theory of color is doubly important. \nOne of the major problems with color has to do with fitting what we\nseem to know about colors into what science (not only physics but the\nscience of color vision) tells us about physical bodies and their\nqualities. It is this problem that historically has led the major\nphysicists who have thought about color, to hold the view that\nphysical objects do not actually have the colors we ordinarily and\nnaturally take objects to possess. Oceans and skies are not blue in\nthe way that we naively think, nor are apples red, (nor green). Colors\nof that kind, it is believed, have no place in the physical account of\nthe world that has developed from the sixteenth century to this\ncentury. \nNot only does the scientific mainstream tradition conflict with the\ncommon-sense understanding of color in this way, but as well, the\nscientific tradition contains a very counter-intuitive conception of\ncolor. There is, to illustrate, the celebrated remark by David\nHume: \nSounds, colors, heat and cold, according to modern philosophy are not\nqualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind. (Hume 1738: Bk III,\npart I, Sect. 1, [1911: 177]; Bk I, IV, IV, [1911: 216])  \nPhysicists who have subscribed to this doctrine include the\nluminaries: Galileo, Boyle, Descartes, Newton, Thomas Young, Maxwell\nand Hermann von Helmholtz. Maxwell, for example, wrote: \nIt seems almost a truism to say that color is a sensation; and yet\nYoung, by honestly recognizing this elementary truth, established the\nfirst consistent theory of color. (Maxwell 1871: 13 [1970: 75])  \nThis combination of eliminativism—the view that physical objects\ndo not have colors, at least in a crucial sense—and\nsubjectivism—the view that color is a subjective\nquality—is not merely of historical interest. It is held by many\ncontemporary experts and authorities on color, e.g., Zeki 1983, Land\n1983, and Kuehni 1997. Palmer, a leading psychologist and cognitive\nscientist, writes: \nPeople universally believe that objects look colored because they are\ncolored, just as we experience them. The sky looks blue because it is\nblue, grass looks green because it is green, and blood looks red\nbecause it is red. As surprising as it may seem, these beliefs are\nfundamentally mistaken. Neither objects nor lights are actually\n“colored” in anything like the way we experience them.\nRather, color is a psychological property of our visual experiences\nwhen we look at objects and lights, not a physical property of those\nobjects or lights. The colors we see are based on physical properties\nof objects and lights that cause us to see them as colored, to be\nsure, but these physical properties are different in important ways\nfrom the colors we perceive. (Palmer 1999: 95)  \nThis quote, however, needs unpacking. Palmer is obviously challenging\nour ordinary common-sense beliefs about colors. Specifically, he is\ndenying that objects and lights have colors in the sense of\ncolors-as-we-experience-them (or colors as we see them), As far as\nthis goes, it is compatible with objects and lights having colors in\nsome other sense, e.g., colors, as defined for scientific purposes.\nSecondly, he is saying that color (i.e., color-as-we-experience it) is\na psychological property, which in turn, might be interpreted in\ndifferent ways. Accordingly, the view is quite complex (see the next\nsection). If we examine the writings of others in the scientific\ntradition, we find that their views are also complex. The view maybe\ncolor-eliminativism, but it is not merely that. \nThere has been a strong resistance among philosophers, both to the\nEliminativist tendency within the scientific tradition, and the\nrelated subjectivism. One form this resistance takes reflects the fact\nthat each component of this traditional view is very puzzling. A\ncommon response is to say that our color terms—red, blue,\npurple, orange, yellow, green, brown, etc.—are in order: we have\nparadigms of colors to which the color terms apply: ripe lemons are\nyellow, tomatoes and rubies are red, and so on. We have no trouble, by\nand large, in learning these terms and teaching them in ostensive\npractices to children and others. In the second place, it is hard to\nmake sense of the claim that colors are properties of sensations or\nare psychological properties: if they are anything they are properties\nof material objects and light sources—of peaches, and emeralds,\nof skies, of rainbows, of glasses of wine, of headlamps, and so\non. \nIt should be noted, however, that things are more complex than the\nearlier remarks of Hume and Maxwell suggest. Descartes and Locke, for\nexample, think that there are no colors in the physical world—no\ncolors, as we ordinarily and naively understand them to be. But they\nare also widely interpreted as holding a secondary quality view of\ncolors, i.e., holding the view that colors are powers or dispositions\nto cause experiences of a certain type. It is instructive to try to\nunderstand this dual position. We find, for example, this passage in\nDescartes’ Principles of Philosophy: \nIt is clear then that when we say we perceive colors in objects,\nit is really just the same as saying that we perceived in\nobjects something as to whose nature we are ignorant but which\nproduces in us a very clear and vivid sensation, what we call the\nsensation of color. (Descartes 1644 [1988]: para. 70; see also paras\n68–70)  \nThe implication of “it is really just the same as saying”\nis that this is not what it is ordinarily taken to be saying. As\nDescartes later explains, the ordinary way involves the mistake of\n“judging that the feature of objects that we call\n‘color’ is something ‘just like the color in our\nsensation’”. However, Descartes is not implying that we\nshould dispense with our ordinary talk. Instead, it is being\nsuggested, we should go on using our ordinary color talk, but give it\na novel interpretation: when we say “X”, then it is\nas though we said “Y”. That is to say, we should\nnot understand the sentences literally, but rather translate them into\nother more appropriate sentences. Descartes, here, is following the\nprinciple common to many thinkers of the time, the principle of\n“talking with vulgar, and thinking with the learned”. The\njustification for this proposal is that it acknowledges that our color\nlanguage serves very useful purposes: the reconstruction allows the\nlanguage to continue to serve those purposes, while avoiding\nmetaphysical error. Thus, there is at least a partial response to the\ncommon-sense criticism: the reconstruction central to this form of\neliminativism embraces a principle of respect for our ordinary\nlanguage. \nThere are also complications with respect to the subjectivist\ncomponent of the traditional view. When philosophers such as Descartes\nand Locke wrote of sensations of color, or of (sensory) ideas of\ncolor, there are different interpretations of what is meant by the\nterms. The common interpretation is that a sensation of red is a\nsensory experience in which a certain subjective quality is presented.\nExpressed in modern terms, the subjective qualities are construed as\nqualia, or as qualities of sensory individuals such as sensa or\nsense-data or as sensational properties. There is, however, an\nalternative interpretation: a sensation of color is a sensory\nexperience, which represents something as having a certain quality\n(the experience has a certain intentional content). On this second\ninterpretation, Descartes’ view would be that the relevant\nquality our color experience represents objects as having is one that\nno object possesses. Accordingly, it would not be inappropriate to\ncall the theory fictionalist (rather than subjectivist). This\ninterpretation, we should note, allows for qualia or sensa, but does\nnot mandate them. And some Cartesian scholars deny that Descartes, in\nparticular, was committed to qualia.  \nFinally, there is yet another complication. It is in fact possible to\ncombine the two versions in a single interpretation. That is to say,\nthe representationalist view does not rule out a version with\nsubjectivist elements. For such a view allows for a type of\nprojectivism, whereby the experience both presents a sensory quality,\nand represents a physical object as having that quality. The\nexperience is said to “project” the subjective, sensory\nqualities onto the physical objects. A model for this would be the\nexperience of pain: the supposition is that when one has a toothache,\nthe experience represents the pain as being in the tooth. (This\nprojectivist view seems to suit Hume’s thought, but in any case,\nit fits modern projectivist accounts.) \nWe might note the it is common to find, in authoritative texts,\ndefinitions like “Color attributes are attributes of visual\nsensations, e.g., hue, saturation and brightness”; “hue:\nattribute of color perception denoted by the terms yellow, red, blue,\ngreen and so forth”; “Brightness is the attribute of a\nvisual sensation according to which a given visual stimulus appears to\nbe more or less intense”. There is a range of ways we might\ninterpret these definitions: \nColor attributes are: \nSeveral of these ways understanding the definitions leave it open\nwhether physical objects actually have the attributes or not, and\nwhether the attributes (that form part of the representational content\nof the experiences) might have subjective components. \nFrom our discussion of the scientific tradition on colors, it is clear\n(enough) that two questions face us: \nFor obvious reasons, these questions present us with what we might\ncall “the Problem of Color Realism”. The discussion also\nindicates that finding answers may be a little tricky. (We should also\nnote that there are complexities associated with our understanding of\nRealism, that we will need to slide over—see the entry\non\n realism.) \nLet us turn to a more recent description of the problem. Byrne and\nHilbert (2003) say, of the problem of color realism, that it\n“concerns various especially salient properties that objects\nvisually appear to have”. By way of clarification, they say: \nIf someone with normal color vision looks at a tomato in good light,\nthe tomato will appear to have a distinctive property—a property\nthat strawberries and cherries also appear to have, and which we call\n“red” in English. The problem of color realism is posed by\nthe following two questions. First, do objects like tomatoes,\nstrawberries and radishes really have the distinctive property that\nthey do appear to have? Second, what is this property? (Byrne &\nHilbert 2003: 3–4)  \nIt would seem that Byrne and Hilbert give us another\nexpression—“the color things appear to be” or\n“the color things look to have”—to go with our\nearlier expressions, “colors-as-we-experience-them”,\n“colors as-we-see-them”. (As we shall see, with each\nexpression, there is an ambiguity which will need to be taken care\nwith, but, it would seem, the same ambiguity apples to each\nexpression.) \nThe use of the expression“colors-as-we-see-them” has\ncertain advantages, in that it brings out certain important features\nof colors. The first is that it implies that a comprehensive account\nof color is going to depend on an account of perceptual experience.\nGiven the controversies on that topic, it is likely to mean that\nsimilar disputes will spill over to the subject of color. For example,\non some views, colors-as-we-see-them will be certain properties\npresented in experience. According to other views, they will be\ncertain properties that material things are represented as having. On\na third view, Color Projectivism, the qualities presented in visual\nexperiences are subjective qualities, which are\n‘projected’ on to material objects: the experiences\nrepresent material objects as having the subjective qualities. Those\nqualities are taken by the perceiver to be qualities instantiated on\nthe surfaces of material objects (the perceiver does not ordinarily\nthink of them as subjective qualities). \nDeciding the question will depend on theories of representational\ncontent (intentional content) perceptual experiences carry; see the\nentry\n the problem of perception.\n Some important readings that delve, extensively, into these areas are\nByrne & Hilbert 1997 Introduction, Shoemaker 1994 [1997], Chalmers\n2006. \nBefore proceeding, there is an important point to clarify. Byrne and\nHilbert, in their characterization of the problem of Color\nRealism, draw attention to the importance of our theories of\nperception in providing an account of colors. There is another aspect\nto their characterization, though the authors tend to downplay its\nimportance. When Byrne and Hilbert introduce the problem, they take\npains to emphasize that it does not concern, at least in the first\ninstance, color language or color concepts. \nHardin seems to adopt a different approach, in his highly influential\nbook, Color for Philosophers (1988 [1993]): \nWhat’s essential to chromatic phenomena, and what’s\naccidental? What might we safely dispense with? Rather than\nundertaking to identify, characterise and then sort through all of the\nfolk notions of color, I shall say what it is that I have in mind when\nI think and talk about colors. Primarily, what I have in mind are red\nand yellow and green and blue, though I am also inclined to include\nwhite and black and gray as well, along, perhaps, with a special place\nfor brown. (Hardin 1993: xx)  \nThe disagreement is, however, less than it first appears. When they\nintroduce the problem of color realism, Byrne and Hilbert say: \nIf someone with normal color vision looks at a tomato in good light,\nthe tomato will appear to have a distinctive property—a property\nthat strawberries and cherries also appear to have, and which we call\n“red” in English. The problem of color realism is posed by\nthe following two questions. First, do objects like tomatoes,\nstrawberries and radishes really have the distinctive property that\nthey do appear to have? Second, what is this property? (Byrne &\nHilbert 2003: 3–4)  \nIt will be noted that I have re-instated their characterization of the\nproperty as “one that we call ‘red’ in\nEnglish”. The point is that we need this clause to identify the\nproperty in question. So, among other things, the enquiry is\ndirected at uncovering the property which our ordinary color terms,\nsuch as ‘red’, designate. So, it cannot entirely avoid\nissues to do with color language and color concepts. We can reinforce\nthe point by referring to the fact that it is common to find color\nauthorities explain central aspect of color, the property of having\nhue, as follows: “Hue: attribute of color perception denoted by\nthe terms yellow, red, blue, green and so forth” (Kuehni 2005:\n187; see also Byrne & Hilbert 1997b: 447, Hardin 1988 [1993:\n212]). \nThe upshot is that it is hard to see how we can avoid questions\nconcerning how our color terms are ordinarily used and understood. One\nimportant approach to answering the questions is that followed by Mark\nJohnston, in a highly influential paper (Johnston 1992). In that\npaper, he implicitly acknowledges the existence of a set of linguistic\nand conceptual practices that underpin what might be called “our\nordinary thinking about color”. This thinking is not meant to\ncomprise theoretical thinking or theorizing about color, or at least,\nit is much more than that. It comprises our thinking and talking that\ninvolves our exercise of concepts of color. Johnston asks the question\nof which principles such thinking about color must consist in, in\norder to count as exercising those concepts of color. \nLike David Lewis and Frank Jackson, he endorses the view that our\nordinary color concepts are captured in those that those with mastery\nof the concept possess. Johnston says that the ordinary concept of\ncolor is a “cluster concept”, which incorporates a wide\nset of beliefs. There are, he points out, many beliefs about color to\nwhich we are susceptible, beliefs resulting from our visual experience\nand our tendency to take that visual experience in certain ways.\nJohnston says that some of these beliefs are “core”\nbeliefs, which we can contrast with the more “peripheral”\nbeliefs. The point about the core beliefs is this: were such beliefs\nto turn out not to be true, we would then have trouble saying what\nthey were false of, i.e., we would be deprived of a subject matter,\nrather than having our views changed about a given subject matter. By\ncontrast, the peripheral beliefs are such that “as they change\nwe are simply changing our mind about a stable subject matter”\n(Johnston 1992 [1997: 137]). \nTaking canary yellow as an illustrative example, he writes that\nbeliefs with a legitimate title to be included in a core of beliefs\nabout canary yellow include: \nCanary yellow is an example. More generally, for each color property\nF, beliefs that are legitimately included in the core of\nbeliefs concerning F, will include the relevant instances of\nthe beliefs (1) to (5). Johnston goes on to argue that in fact there\nare no properties for which all of these beliefs hold true.\nAccordingly, “speaking ever so inclusively”, the world is\nnot colored. However, he maintains, “speaking more or less\ninclusively”, the world is colored, for there are properties\nwhich make true enough of these beliefs, so as to deserve to be called\ncolors. Johnston then goes on to defend the view that the closest\ncandidates for the various colors are the dispositional properties,\ndispositions to look yellow, to look blue, etc. The item in the list\nthat provides most trouble is item (5) the doctrine of Revelation. To\ndrop this from the list, he thinks, is a price worth paying, to\npreserve that claim that there really are colors. \nIt is of course an important question as to whether the list is\naccurate or complete. To make progress on that question, however,\nthere is, a prior question to answer: what are the criteria for\ninclusion in the list? (Whose beliefs are they supposed to be?) On the\nface of it, they are beliefs of those who have mastery of the concepts\nof color, i.e., including the many ordinary people who lack detailed\nscientific knowledge. This is certainly the view of Lewis and Jackson,\nwho use the term “folk concept” in referring to the\nordinary concept and who, in addition, see the possession of the\nconcept as involving having a theory, e.g., a folk theory of color: a\nset of beliefs or platitudes about color.  \nHowever, when we look at the items of Johnston’s list, it seems\ndifficult to maintain this view about the status of the various items.\nTake item (5), Revelation. Whatever its status, it doesn’t look\nlike a folk belief. It looks more like something a philosopher might\ncome up with. In the second place, it seems to have a peculiar status.\nExperiences of color, it is claimed, are enough to inform us of the\nnature of color. If it is true or if it is a folk belief, it is hard\nto see what need there is of the other items in the list. Perhaps,\nthough, this formulation of the doctrine is misleading, and there is a\nbetter formulation available. One possibility is that the doctrine\nshould be interpreted as addressing certain necessary conditions,\nrather than all necessary conditions, or all necessary and sufficient\nconditions. This point is important since there is group of\nphilosophers who are sympathetic to Primitivism and/or Naïve\nRealism, who seem to favor a principle that differs in this way from\nJohnston’s formulation\n (see section 2.1).\n \nBut let us concentrate on item, (3), which Johnston labels\n“Unity”. What it points to is the fact that the various\ncolors can be ordered systematically, in a structured array of all the\ncolors, where that array is based on the system of relations of\nsimilarity, difference and exclusion holding among the colors. The\ncolor “yellow” is said to have a unique place in this\narray. Johnston explains the principle in more detail: \nThink of the relations exemplified along the axes of hue, saturation\nand brightness in the so-called color solid. The color solid captures\ncentral facts about the colors, e.g., that canary yellow is not as\nsimilar to the shades of blue as they are similar among themselves,\ni.e., that canary yellow is not a shade of blue. (Johnston 1992 [1997:\n138])  \nThere is little doubt that this is an important principle, one which\nplays a central part in the reasoning of many philosophers who have\nwritten on color, e.g., Wittgenstein 1977, Harrison 1973, Hardin 1988,\nThompson 1995, Maund 1995. It is regarded as an important factor which\nphysicalist-realist theories of color must explain, and have a problem\nin explaining. However, whatever the status of this principle, it is\nnot a folk belief (and few of these last-mentioned theorists say that\nit is). Nor is it plausibly a tacit belief. For example, it does not\nseem a belief it is necessary to have, in order to have mastery of\nconcepts of color and, in particular, of a concept of yellow. It is\nsurely quite a sophisticated belief, which requires considerable\nexperience with colors. For one thing, the dimensions mentioned by\nJohnston—hue, saturation and brightness—apply to aperture\ncolors or film colors, which few folk would be aware of, and not to\nsurface colors. Aperture colors are colors perceived under a special\nmode of viewing: one views the objects or light sources through a\nsmall aperture in a screen (of an achromatic color). The appearance of\nthese colors differs from that of colors seen under more usual\ncircumstances. “Surface colors” are the colors of\nilluminated samples seen under conditions in which it is possible for\nthe viewer to distinguish the color of the surface from that of the\nambient light. Indeed, for surface colors, there are two sets of\ndimensions: hue, chroma, and lightness (the Munsell system) and hue,\nchromaticness and whiteness/blackness (the Swedish Natural Color\nsystem, NCS). Nevertheless, Unity (or a set of Unities) is an\nimportant principle and it has something to do with our concepts of\ncolor. Wittgenstein, for example, thought it was central to our having\nthe concepts of color that we do, but he says that “we do not\nwant to find a theory of color … but rather the logic of color\nconcepts” (Wittgenstein 1977:43e). (We are touching on deep issues of philosophical methodology, which we are\nnot going to settle here; see the entry\n analysis,\n which, interestingly, discusses Jackson’s analysis of\ncolor.) \nThere is another explanation for why Johnston’s principles (1)\nto (5) are important, besides their being folk beliefs. It is more\nplausible to see them as items of knowledge: of facts or truths, that\nare readily accessible to someone who has the relevant concepts. For\nexample, once we are fluent with color names, and are competent in the\nexercise of color concepts, we are then in a position to come to know\nthat Unity holds with respect to the colors. We won’t discover\nthis, however, until we have familiarity with a wide range of colors\nand can see the various colors ordered in suitable arrays. Likewise,\nwith the other items in Johnston’s list, e.g., (5), the doctrine\nof Revelation. Indeed, if we look at item (1), in Johnston’s\nlist, the item he labels “Paradigms”, it explicitly states\none such sort of fact: it states that there are paradigms of canary\nyellow, things that are canary yellow.  \nThese considerations are not trivial, for when we examine the examples\nthat Lewis and Jackson give of the relevant constraints on color, we\nfind that they function as items of knowledge, rather than as mere\nbeliefs. Indeed Lewis often refers to the folk beliefs as items of\n“common knowledge” (Lewis 1997).\nIn Jackson’s case, consider\nwhat he says, concerning what he calls “the prime intuition\nabout colour” (1998: 88): “red” denotes the property\nof an object putatively presented in visual experience when that\nobject looks red. This he also calls “a subject-determining\nplatitude for ‘red’” (1998:89). What is particularly\ninteresting is what Jackson does with this “prime\nintuition”. He says that it seems trivial, but its significance\nis that it tells us \nsomething important about the metaphysics of colour, when we combine\nit with plausible views about what is required for an experience to be\nthe presentation of a property: a necessary condition for experience\nE to be the presentation of property P is that there be\na causal connection in normal cases. (Jackson 1998: 89)  \nThat is to say, in arguing to a substantive metaphysical\nconclusion—namely, that color is a certain microphysical\nproperty—Jackson is combining the result of his intuitions\n(which he claims to share with the “folk”) with a certain\npiece of knowledge.  \nA useful way of thinking of the methodology for the philosophy of\ncolor is that given by Hilbert in an early work: \n[T]he question of the objectivity of color is in the end a conceptual\none. To settle the question, we need to discover which way of\nconceptualising color allows us to account for both pre-theoretical\nintuitions regarding color and the wide range of known color\nphenomena. (Hilbert 1987: 16)  \nThis view seems to accommodate a modified version of Johnston’s\napproach. It also allows the possibility that a theorist might defend\na theory of color by rejecting some of the “pre-reflective\nintuitions”, while explaining why those intuitions might be\nheld. A recent work that addresses some these issues is Adams 2016.\nAdams argues that the modern debate between certain\ncolor-eliminativists and Oxford color-dispositionalists is affected by\nthe fact that members of each side are guided by different\ncolor-intuitions, ones that have historical sources. One does not have\nto agree with Adams to appreciate that he raises a serious issue for\nthought about the metaphysics of color. \nThe issues raised in this section involve complex issues of\nphilosophical methodology, about which there is much contemporary\ndispute. No short discussion of such issues can hope to be\ncomprehensive. Different philosophers hold sharply differing views\nabout both the nature of conceptual analysis and its significance.\nPart of the aim of this section was to bring out that the practice of\ndifferent groups of philosophers is closer than one would expect from\ntheir official views. \nOne of the most important issues for the philosophy of color to\naddress concerns the phenomenal character of color experiences. This\nissue, in turn, raises general questions of whether the experiences\nhave representational content and if so, of what type, and questions\nabout whether there are non-intentional aspects to the phenomenal\ncharacter. The question of phenomenal character is related to what\naccount one’s theory can give (or require) of what it is for\nsomething to look a certain color: to look blue, to look yellow, to look\nred, and so on. This notion plays a central role in most accounts,\neither in giving an account of what color is, or for raising problems\nthat the theory needs to resolve. \nThe most notable example is the most common version of the\ndispositional account: for something to be yellow is to be such as to\nlook yellow—to normal observers, in standard conditions (McGinn\n1983; Johnston 1992 [1997]; Levin 2000). Another example is the\nrelational view of Jonathan Cohen (2009) and Edward Averill (1992),\nthe view that implies that colors are relational properties, defined\nin terms of the object’s capacity to look a certain way, in\ncontextually defined circumstances, to contextually defined observers.\n  But the notion also plays a central role in theories of\nphysicalist objectivists such as McLaughlin (2003) and Jackson\n(1998). According to McLaughlin, colors are the “occupants of a\ncertain functional role-description” (2003: 479), where the\nfunctional role is specified in terms of the ways things look, that\nare peculiar to colors. Jackson makes crucial use of what he calls\n“the prime intuition about colour”: The prime intuition is\nsimply that red is the property objects look to have when they look\nred (Jackson 1998: 89). Finally, both Byrne & Hilbert 2003 and\nBoghossian & Velleman 1991 [1997] characterize the dispute between\nrealists and non-realists on color, to concern “certain\nproperties that objects visually appear [i.e., look] to have”\n(Boghossian & Velleman 1991 [1997: 117]). As Boghossian and\nVelleman put it, \nWhat philosophers want to know is whether the properties that objects\nthus appear to have are among the ones that they are generally agreed\nto have in reality. (Boghossian & Velleman 1991 [1997: 106])  \nThe centrality of this notion raises the question of what exactly is\nit for something to look blue, look yellow, look pink, etc.\nUnfortunately, despite its apparent simplicity, this question is not\neasily settled. It is usual for theorists to rely upon what is called\n“the phenomenological use” of “looks\nF”, where this use can be distinguished from the\nperceptual-epistemic (and epistemic) and the comparative uses of the\nsame phrase. However, different theorists take the phenomenological\nuse in different ways. For some, it is connected with the idea that\nthe experience or state carries representational content, while others\ntake it to refer to non-intentional aspects of experience. And of\nthose who connect it with representational content, there are some who\nhold that the content is conceptual, and others who think it is\nnon-conceptual. Finally, it is not at all unusual for some theorists\nto hold that experiences have two aspects, i.e., non-intentional and\nintentional characteristics, and/or conceptual and non-conceptual\naspects, and that “looks yellow”, say, can be used, on\ndifferent occasions to refer to these different aspects. (For further\ndiscussion, see Shoemaker 1994 [1997], Chalmers 2006, Glüer 2012, the entry on\n the problem of perception.) \nThe commonest way to think of “looks blue” is to think of\nthe phrase as having a semantic structure, with “blue”\nhaving its usual sense. This use, which is found in common practice,\ncan be contrasted with an unstructured sense of\n“looks-blue”, in which the term “blue” does\nnot make the same contribution. For X to look-blue in this\nsense is usually taken to mean that X causes a certain type of\nexperience (or type of visual state), a type that is not defined by\nreference to the property of being blue, and whose occurrence does not\nrequire the subject to have the concept of being blue. It is often\nthought of in these terms: for X to look-blue to S is\nfor X to induce in S a blue-ish-appearance—or\nappearing. (For further discussion, see Chisholm 1966: 95–99,\nCornman 1975: 73–77.) This use of “looks” is usually\nintroduced by philosophers for theoretical purposes, though some argue\nthat it is implicit in the ordinary use of “looks blue”,\n“looks square”, etc.  \nUnfortunately, there is more than one way different philosophers\nunderstand the innocuous-looking structured use. Many philosophers\ntake it as obvious that for something to look blue is for it to be\nrepresented as being blue, and that, given that this is so, it is\nperfectly understandable that it could look blue to me without my\nbelieving, or even being inclined to believe, that it is blue, e.g.,\nJackson 2000, 2007. The claim is that for X to look blue is\nfor it to cause a visual experience or visual state that represents\nthe object as blue. Furthermore, thinking in these representational\nterms explains why it is that some perceivings are veridical, and\nothers non-veridical. In veridical cases, the representation is\naccurate—things are as they are represented as being—in\nthe other case, they are not accurate.  \nIn recent times, however, there has emerged a growing minority\nposition that challenges this view. Martin 2002 has been the most\ninfluential, but there are many others: Snowdon 1981, Hacker 1987,\nMcDowell 1994, Travis 2004. As Martin points out, both the view known\nas naïve realism, and the disjunctivist account of perceptual\nexperiences, offer a different way of understanding “looks\nF”. On the disjunctivist account, we do not have to take\nveridical experiences and non-veridical ones as being of a uniform\ntype: they can be subjectively indistinguishable, yet different in\nnature (see the entry on\n the disjunctivist theory of perception.\n On this view, in the case of veridical perceiving, we do not have an\nexperience which represents an object as having colors, shape, size,\netc. Instead we should think of these qualities as being presented to the\nperceiver in having the experience. On the naïve realist view,\n“looks blue” is still structured: the property of being\nblue is presented in the experience. This issue is particularly\nimportant for a theory of color, for one way of explaining the\nPrimitivist theory is to connect it with a naïve realist view of\ncolor\n (see section 2.1).\n One might defend the Primitivist view and also claim that the\nprimitivist properties are part of the representational content.  \nThere is an added complication. Of those philosophers who assume that\nvisual experiences have representational content, some, like Jackson,\ndo so within a framework in which the content is conceptual, while\nothers such as Tye, Byrne, and Hilbert, take it to be non-conceptual.\nFurthermore, there are yet others, such as Peacocke 1984/1997, \nwho hold that there are two\ndistinct aspects to color experiences, one non-conceptual, the other\nconceptual. Peacocke defends a theory in which “looks red”\nis confined to the conceptual, representing sense. On this account, we\nmust distinguish between two aspects to the visual experience had,\nwhen S sees a red object, and where it looks red to her; (1) a\nsensational property red* is presented to S, in a region of her\nvisual field; (2) S is in (or has) a state which represents,\nconceptually, to S that X (or at least something) is\nred. \nThere are two issues concerning color realism: (1) what sort of\nproperties are colors? (2) do objects really possess those properties?\nWith respect to the first question, there is deep division between\ndifferent color realists (as well as between them and eliminativists).\nSetting out the views of major realists and eliminativists, we have\nthe following major rival theories: \nNote:  \nFor further details, see the supplementary document on\n Color Science: Some Complexities. \nIn an earlier section,\n 1.6,\n the major rival theories of color were set out. They comprise\nvarieties of color realism and color eliminativism/fictionalism. In\nthis section, we will examine specific versions of these theories.\nMany of the general issues that have been touched upon will come up\nfor discussion. \nOne of the most prominent views of color is that color is an\nobjective, i.e., mind-independent, intrinsic property, one possessed\nby many material objects (of different kinds) and light sources. (By\n“objective” here, I mean “ontologically\nobjective”, i.e., mind-independent—see Searle 2015: 16.)\nThis view, call it Color Objectivism, takes different forms,\nhowever. One form it takes is that colors are simple qualities, which\nshow their natures on their face: they are sui generis,\nsimple, qualitative, sensuous, intrinsic, irreducible properties.This\nview has come to be called “Color Primitivism”. Another\ncommon form is that colors are objective (mind-independent),\nproperties of material bodies and light sources, whose natures are\n“hidden” from us, and require empirical investigation to\ndiscover. I shall use the term “Reductive Color\nPhysicalism” to refer to it. \nColor Primitivism comes in two forms: a realist vision and an\neliminativist version. Color Primitivist Realism is the view that\nthere are in nature colors, as ordinarily understood, i.e., colors are\nsimple intrinsic, non-relational, non-reducible, qualitative\nproperties. They are qualitative features of the sort that stand in\nthe characteristic relations of similarity and difference that mark\nthe colors; they are not micro-structural properties or reflectances,\nor anything of the sort. There is no radical illusion, error or\nmistake in color perception (only commonplace illusions): we perceive\nobjects to have the colors that they really have. Such a view has been\npresented by Hacker 1987 and by J. Campbell 1994, 2005, and has become\nincreasingly popular: McGinn 1996; Watkins 2005; Gert 2006, 2008. This\nview is sometimes called “The Simple View of Color” and\nsometimes “The Naive Realist view of Color”. Primitivist\nColor realism contains a conceptual (and semantic) thesis about our\nordinary understanding of color, and a metaphysical thesis, namely,\nthat physical bodies actually have colors of this sort. It is possible\nto accept the conceptual thesis but deny the metaphysical thesis. This\ngives us an eliminativist form of Color Primitivism. \nOne major criticism with Primitivism concerns whether the arguments\nfor it depends on a questionable form of the doctrine of Revelation.\n(See Byrne & Hilbert 2007a, for an expression of this criticism, among a set of other\ncriticisms.) In response, many authors argue that the form of\nRevelation set out by Johnston is too strong, and there is a more\nmoderate form of the doctrine that is more plausible (see J. Campbell\n2005; Gert 2008; Allen 2011). It is worth noting that while Johnston\nand others cite Bertrand Russell and Galen Strawson as advocates of\nthe doctrine, these two authors actually say very different things, in\nthe quotes given to illustrate the doctrine. Russell, for example,\nplaces stress on the perceiver being acquainted with instances of\ncolor. The suggestion implicit in modest versions of the doctrine\nis that the appeal to Revelation needs little more than that. \nOne of the major problem, historically, concerns whether it is\npossible to reconcile the putative character of the intrinsic color\nfeatures with such features having a causal role in our experiences of\ncolors. The properties that do the causing of these experiences seem\nto be complex, micro-structural properties of surfaces of bodies (and\nsimilar properties for seeing volume colors, diffraction colors,\nscattering colors, etc). This problem is addressed by Hacker in his\ndefense of the claim that colors are intrinsic features of physical\nbodies. He insists that colors are properties that are used to provide\ncausal explanations. There is no more reason to deny this, he says,\nthan there is to deny the parallel claim for solidity and liquidity.\nThe explanation is not vitiated by the discovery that microstructural\nprocesses are involved, any more than explanations concerning solidity\nand liquidity are rendered otiose by the discovery of the\nmicrostructural base for these properties. A possible criticism of\nthis analogy would be that, in the case of solidity and liquidity, it\nis plausible to analyze these properties functionally: to be solid is\nto have some structure that is the causal basis for such and such ways\nof behaving. This is not the sort of analysis that the Primitivist\nrequires (see also Campbell 1994). \nThe Primitivist Realist needs to have some view about how colors are\nrelated to the physical properties of material objects, e.g., spectral\nreflectances, that are necessary in order for us to have experiences\nof color. That is to say, it is vital that they have some theory on\nthe matter. The standard view has come to be that colors are\nsupervenient on these physical properties. On some accounts, the\nsupervenience relations are nomological ones; on other accounts, they\nare metaphysical (rather than logical)—see Hacker 1987, Campbell\n1994, Yablo 1995, McGinn 1996, Watkins 2005. Appeals to supervenience are fine as far as\nthey go but, as often been pointed out, they mark the start of an\nexplanation, rather than the end (see entry on\n supervenience).\n We need to specify which kind of supervenience is involved:\nnomological, logical or metaphysical (where and if the latter can be\ndistinguished from the logical form). Secondly, we need to give some\naccount of what it is that grounds the supervenience relation. Byrne\nand Hilbert, in a complex paper specifically on Primitivism (2007a), argue that appeals to both\nnomological and metaphysical supervenience face formidable\nobjections. \nAnother major problem for the realist version of Color Primitivism is\none that Hardin (2004, 2008) and Cohen (2009) have especially\nstressed. They draw attention to a vast range of facts concerning the\nvariety of conditions under which objects appear to have the colors\nthey do, and the variety of classes of observers for whom the colors\nappear. Since the only way to determine what primitivist color a body\nhas is by the way it appears, this raises the question of which is the\nbody’s real color. Normal perceivers, for example, divide into\ndifferent groups on whether a body’s color is, say, unique blue,\nor rather, a slightly reddish-blue, an even more reddish blue, or,\nalternatively, a greenish blue. Cohen and Hardin argue that there is\nno non-arbitrary way to pick out one group of perceivers as\nidentifying the “real” color. At most, one group is\ncorrect, but we would not know which; for all we know, none of the\ngroups is identifying the real color. Averill (1992) presents a pair\nof arguments that also depend on difficulties that stem from trying to\ngive a non-arbitrary account of normal observers and standard viewing\nconditions. We can easily suppose changes in either our eyes (and\nhence in normal observers) or in standard viewing conditions, such\nthat some objects that previously were yellow would look red, and\nothers would still look yellow—while remaining otherwise\nphysically unchanged. If primitive colors are supposed to be\nsupervenient on physical microstructures, then it is difficult to see\nhow we could accommodate this sort of change. A possible, but radical,\nresponse to this problem is to modify the Realist position and to hold\nthat objects can have more than one color (indeed have many colors).\nSee Kalderon 2007 and Mizrahi 2006 for a defense of this view. \nAnother common form of Color Objectivism is that colors are objective\n(mind-independent), properties of material bodies and light sources,\nwhose natures are “hidden” from us, and require empirical\ninvestigation to discover. This theory is commonly known as\nPhysicalist Color Realism  but I shall use the title\nReductive Color Physicalism. (The properties that constitute\nthe colors, for Color Primitivism, are “physical” in one\ngood sense of the term.) \nPerhaps the earliest defender of this second form of Color Objectivism\nwas Thomas Reid, the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher. More\nrecent examples are Armstrong 1969; Hilbert 1987; Matthen 1988;\nJackson 1996, 1998, 2007; Tye 2000; Byrne & Hilbert 2003; and\nMcLaughlin 2003. Reid thought that the folk did not think as\nphilosophers such as Hume and Descartes and others said that they did.\nReid wrote that: \nBy colour, all men who have not been tutored by modern philosophy\nunderstand, not a sensation of the mind, which can have no existence\nwhen it is not perceived, but a quality or modification of bodies,\nwhich continues to be the same whether it is seen or not. (Reid 1764:\nch. 6, sect. 4 [1970: 99]) \nIt would seem that, so far, Reid is simply displaying the common sense\nfor which he is famous. More controversially, however, he goes on to\nsay that when we perceive the color of body,  \nThat idea, which we have called the appearance of colour, suggests the\nconception and belief of some unknown quality in the body\nwhich occasions the idea, and it is to this quality and not\nthe idea, that we give the name of colour. (Reid 1764:\nch. 6, sect. 4 [1970: 100])  \nOn the face of it, this view of Reid seems counter-intuitive. Many of\n“those men not tutored by modern philosophy”, have a lot to say\nabout colors, and would be surprised to be told that colors are\nunknown qualities. Red, for example, is the color used by many\nrevolutionary parties, good for annoying bulls, my favorite color, the\ncolor of my true love’s lips, and so on. We can give paradigms\nof blue, red, yellow, turquoise, mauve, etc. We often say things such\nas “that is a better blue than this”. One suspects that\nthey (the untutored) would be puzzled by the remark that red is some\nunknown quality (for more on this, see Hacker 1987: 186). \nReid’s view may be extreme but it helps us appreciate the\nsignificance of the view of a contemporary color physicalist,\nMcLaughlin, who singles Reid out as anticipating his account of color.\nMcLaughlin explicitly endorses this view of Reid though, in fact, his\nposition is subtly different. He defends a functionalist analysis of\ncolor, according to which a color, say redness, is the occupant of a\ncertain functional role: \nRedness is that property which disposes its bearers to look red, to\nstandard visual perceivers in standard conditions of visual\nobservation, and which must (as a matter of nomological necessity) be\nheld by everything so disposed. (McLaughlin 2003: 479)  \nMcLaughlin adds that this proposal is intended as providing a\nconceptual analysis: \nThe proposal is intended as a functional or topic neutral analysis of\nthe concept of redness. The role description “that property\nwhich …” is intended not only to fix the referent of the\nconcept, but also to express a condition that is necessary and\nsufficient for satisfying it. Thus, if the proposal is correct, then\nall it takes for a property to be redness is for it to fill the\nredness role. (McLaughlin 2003: 479) \nMcLaughlin’s proposal is different, in a crucial respect, from\nReid’s. It does not explicitly state that the property, which is\nthe occupant of the functional role, is a property\n“unknown” to the observer. His proposal is designed to be\n“topic-neutral”. This means that colors could either be\nsome complex physical properties, that could only be discovered by\nscientific investigation, or they could be the sort of properties\ndescribed by Primitivists: sui generis, simple, intrinsic,\nqualitative, non-relational, non-reducible properties of physical\nbodies. McLaughlin argues that scientific investigation makes it\nhighly plausible that the occupant of the role is some complex\nphysical property—that is, that Color Physicalism is\ntrue—and that no good reason favors the Primitivist option. \nMcLaughlin’s topic-neutral proposal is a proposal about our\nordinary understanding of color. Most Primitivists would accept this\ncondition as capturing, at best, only one element of that\nunderstanding. (Some would say that the proposal expresses a truth\nthat we can recognize, but it is not part of the ordinary\nunderstanding.) Other elements, they would contend, rule out the\ncomplex physical properties that McLaughlin indicates. A plausible\ncandidate for one of these elements is the doctrine of Revelation,\nitem (5) of the list that, as we saw, Johnston provides, in his\n“cluster” of core color beliefs. \nThis would explain the Primitivist account of the character of the\ncolors, as being revealed in our perceptual experience. McLaughlin\naddresses the status of Revelation in his argument. He thinks that\nthis doctrine, once we reflect on it, has little to recommend it. What\nappeal it has depends on the fact that it is easily confused with\nanother principle, which has some intuitive appeal (though it too is\nfalse). He does not have an explicit argument against the doctrine,\nalthough he draws a consequence that he thinks we would all find\nunwelcome: \nAll we have learned, and indeed, all we can ever hope to learn by\nscientific investigation will contribute not one whit to our knowledge\nof the nature of colors themselves. For Revelation entails that there\nis nothing more that we can learn about the nature of colors than what\nvisual experience teaches us. (McLaughlin 2003: 477.)  \nHe thinks that there is a basic mistake behind the commitment to the\ndoctrine of Revelation: the failure to distinguish colors from what it\nis like to see them. Revelation, he concedes, is more plausible with\nrespect to the phenomenal character of color experiences—the\nwhat-it-is-like aspect—though, here, too, it is false. \nOne of the virtues of this form of Color Physicalism is that it offers\na plausible explanation for the phenomenon of color constancy, the\nfact that there is strong tendency for the same object to look to have\nthe same color in a wide variety of illuminations. Against this claim,\nhowever, it has been argued that other theories have the resources to\nexplain the phenomenon (to the extent that it occurs, for which there\nare certain limits—see Hardin 1988, Cohen 2009, Chirimuuta\n2008.) \nAn initial problem is “the problem of multiple\nrealizations”: there is a wide range of different types of\nbodies that have colors—light sources, illuminants, surfaces\n(e.g., of apples, cars, cloths, paintings, …), volumes (e.g.,\nwine, glass, atmospheres, …), bodies that scatter light, bodies\nthat diffract light, films, and luminescent bodies. The causes of the\ncolors objects appear to have, are many and varied. For most\ntheorists, however, the most plausible physicalist candidates for the\ncolors are light-related properties, e.g., capacities to emit,\nreflect, absorb, transmit or scatter light to varying degrees. For\nphysical surfaces, the color is taken to be related to the\nobject’s reflectance profile, i.e., the capacity to\ndifferentially reflect wavelengths from different regions of the\nincident illumination. It turns out, however, that, for each surface\ncolor, there is no single reflectance curve associated with that\ncolor, but many. The situation is similar, in the case of film colors\nor aperture colors. That is to say, for each color, there is a set of\nmetamers. (Two stimuli—bodies, sources of light, etc.—that\ndiffer in their physical characteristics, but are matched in\nappearance under a certain illumination, by the same observer, are\nmetamers for that observer, in that illumination. Two bodies that are\nmetamers in one illumination need not be metamers under a different\nillumination, or for a different observer.)  \nThe favored response to this problem is to say, for example, that a\ngiven color, red, say, is not a specific color reflectance, but a type\nof reflectance, i.e., one that is a member of a certain group.\nHowever, there are still problems. Averill (1992, 2005), for example,\npresents some interesting arguments, which are based on plausible\nconjectures about how normal observers and standard conditions might\neasily enough change, with consequent metameric change. The color\nphysicalist seems to be committed to a very arbitrary grouping of\nreflectances into the various types. \nThis problem is related to one that Hardin (1988, 2004) and Cohen\n(2009) have drawn attention to. It has to do with the problem of\nidentifying, in a non-arbitrary way, normal conditions, and\nstandard observers. The objectivist account requires that we\nidentify the “real” color for object X as a certain\ncausal basis (e.g., the reflectance profile) for the way it appears,\nto normal observers and in standard conditions. The problem is that,\nas Hardin has persuasively pointed out, particularly, in Hardin 2004,\nthis cannot be done except in a highly arbitrary way. Not only is\nthere a minority of color perceivers who are anomalous (only slightly,\nbut appreciably so) with respect to normal observers, but there is a\nconsiderable statistical spread even within the group of normal\nobservers. For example, the reflectance profile for unique green will\ndiffer for different members of the “normal group”. One\ncan decide, of course, on a standard and fix one reflectance profile\nas green, but the procedure is highly arbitrary. As we have seen,\nthere are few interesting causal powers associated with colors apart\nfrom the way objects affect perceivers. (This argument has led to a\nvigorous debate in the pages of Analysis, see Byrne &\nHilbert 2007b; Cohen, Hardin & McLaughlin 2006a,b; and Tye 2006a,b, 2007.) \nTo counter this problem, McLaughlin suggests that we extend a\nproposal, which Jackson and Pargetter (1987) made, originally to\novercome the problem of multiple realizations. They proposed\nrelativising the concept of color, to kinds of objects and\ncircumstances. McLaughlin’s suggestion is that we could extend\nthe objectivist concept of color, by relativising it to individual\nobservers.  \nAnother major objection to the physicalist (reductive) account\nconcerns whether the properties can satisfy the principle of\n“Unity”, as described by Johnston,\n (see section 2.2).\n This principle points to the fact that the various colors, it would\nseem, are the kinds of properties that fit together in characteristic\nways to form structured color arrays, with a distinctive 3-dimensional\ncharacter, built on attributes such as hue/saturation/brightness (or\nhue, chroma, lightness). The principle of Unity would seem to pose a\nserious problem for the Color Physicalist (see Hardin 1988; Thompson\n1995; Maund 1995, 2011). As McLaughlin concedes, the problem is  \nthat no physical properties that are even remotely plausible\ncandidates for being the properties essentially participate in these\npatterns of relationships. (McLaughlin 2003: 487) \nHis solution to the problem is that the comparative claims, e.g.,\nabout red, orange and blue—orange is more similar to red than to\nblue—are true in virtue of a comparative fact about the visual\nexperiences in question.  \nColors themselves participate in the similarity and difference\nrelationships derivatively—in virtue of the participation of the\nvisual experiences that they dispose their bearers to produce.\n(McLaughlin 2003: 487)  \nThe claim, here, is that what it is like to for something to look red\nis more similar to what it is like for something to look\norange than it is to what it is like for something to look\nblue. This solution, however, raises the question of what features of\nthe experience are relevant ones, i.e., are the features which stand\nin the relations of similarity and difference. There seem to be two\npossibilities: (i) they are features of the experiences themselves;\n(ii) they are features presented in experience or represented in them,\ni.e., they are features of regions of visual fields, or of sensa, or\nof material objects. There are some prima facie problems which ensue.\nAssuming the former possibility, then our color experiences involve\nmassive error. The judgments of similarity and difference are applied\nto the colors and not to our experiences. If the second possibility is\nadopted, i.e., it is held that there are certain features, presented\nin, or represented in, experience, then they stand in the relations of\nsimilarities and differences. These features are different from\nreflectances, so the color physicalist needs to say what they are. \nTye and Byrne and Hilbert have proposed a solution to this last\nproblem, one that depends on exploiting the opponent-processing model\nof color vision (see Supplement Color Science: Some Complexities.). It\nis to specify the relevant groups of spectral reflectances, associated\nwith each color, in terms of their capacity to produce suitable\nresponses of the visual system. The argument, by Byrne and Hilbert,\nproceeds in two steps: (1) it is argued that color experience are\ncharacterized as having a certain representational content: they\nrepresent objects as having what Byrne and Hilbert call\n“hue” magnitudes; (2) the hue-magnitudes are explained in\nterms of being certain physical properties. As they argue, if we can\ngive the right account of how the magnitudes contribute to the\nrepresentational content, then we can explain the similarity relations\namong the hues and the binary/unique distinction, in terms of the\ncontent of color experience. \nThis proposal, in turn, has been subject to criticism from several\nauthors, e.g., Hardin 2003, Pautz 2006, Maund 2011, and Allen\n2015. \nThere is a group of views about color, which come under one or all of\nthe labels, Color Irrealism, Color Eliminativism, Color Fictionalism.\nThese titles are a little misleading, since some theorists also talk\nof there being colors in the sense of being dispositions to cause\nexperiences of a characteristic type, and/or being (attributes in/of)\nsensations. Following our earlier discussion, in\n section 1.2,\n we may take it that what the color-Eliminativist is denying is that\nmaterial objects and lights have colors of a certain kind: colors that\nwe ordinarily and unreflectingly take the bodies to have. That is to\nsay, these views are usually committed to an “Error\ntheory” of visual color experience. Indeed the theories are\noften referred to as “Error theories” of color. Prominent\ncontemporary defenders of variants of this view are Hardin (1988),\nBoghossian & Velleman (1989), Averill (2005), and Maund (1995,\n2006, 2011). Earlier defenders were Galileo, Descartes, Locke and\nothers.  \nThe most general argument for Color Irrealism/Eliminativism is\naddressed to the ordinary conception of color (and the use of ordinary\ncolor terms.) The argument, in brief is that Color Primitivism gets it\nright about the kinds of properties colors are:simple, qualitative,\nintrinsic properties, typically possessed by surfaces of material\nbodies. Only, material bodies do not actually have them. Thus there\nare two crucial steps in the argument for Color Irrealism/Eliminativism: the first\nis to argue that bodies do not actually have the sort of colors\ndescribed by Primitivism; the second is to argue against Reductive\nColor Physicalism and Color Dispostionalism. The second step is to the\neffect that these theories are phenomenally inadequate, as well as\nfailing to account for a range of color phenomena. \nNeither the properties posited by the Primitivist, nor those posited\nby the Color Physicalist, it is argued, can satisfy all the required\nconstraints for being colors. As we saw in the last two sections, both\nsorts of theorists have a response to this objection. The debate\nbetween the Color Eliminativists and their opponents will thus depend\non the plausibility of such responses, and counter-responses (see the\nearlier sections\n 2.1,\n 2.2). As far as Primitivist Realism is concerned, one central\nissue is this. The defense of this position, it seems, would need to\nappeal to some version of Naïve Realism, and/or Disjunctivism,\nand there are strong arguments against these accounts. For example, it\nis not clear how these accounts can handle the fact that many of our\nexperiences have both veridical and illusory elements: the Muller-Lyer\nlines look unequal, when they are not; but they also look thin, and\nlook to be in front of me, and look black (see the entry on\n perception: the disjunctivist theory of perception).\n Another important issue is the one Hardin (2004, 2008) and Cohen\n(2009) raise: that it depends on some non-arbitrary identification of\nstandard conditions, and normal observers, one that cannot be\nsatisfied (see\n section 2.1,\n above). \nMost versions of Color Eliminativism/Irrealism commit one to an error\ntheory of visual experience. As Boghossian and Velleman (1989 [1997:\n93]) put it: “visual experience is ordinarily naively realistic,\nin the sense that the qualities presented in it are represented as\nqualities of the external world” (see also Averill 2005 and\nMaund 2011). This leads them to explain how this happens by adopting a\nProjectivist account of color experience: \nThe projection posited by this account has the result that the\nintentional content of visual experience represents external objects\nas possessing qualities that belong, in fact, only to regions of the\nvisual field. By “gilding or staining all natural objects with\nthe colors borrowed from internal sentiments”, as Hume puts it,\nthe mind “raises in a manner a new creation”. (Boghossian\n& Velleman 1989 [1997: 95])  \nIn ordinary color experience, it is implied, physical objects are\nrepresented (or presented) as having certain qualities that are\nillusory, and accordingly, that experience involve errors. It is\nimportant to keep in mind that such claims are not simply negative.\nIllusions and errors can serve positive functions. The claim that\nexperiences represent objects as having qualities with a certain\ncharacter, can explain why we form the concepts we do, why we identify\nand recognize objects, and so on. This means that it is still the case\nthat there are important reasons for retaining our ordinary color\nconcepts, even though they are not actualized. This fact motivates the\nthought that the proper attitude to adopt towards our color language\nis a fictionalist one: for many purposes we should think of the color\nsentences with their ordinary meaning—but treat them only as if they are\ntrue (see Gatzia 2007, 2008). \nBeing an error theory of visual experience, Color Eliminativism is\nsometimes thought to leave us with a severe problem (see Byrne &\nHilbert 2007a). If there are\nno properties that satisfy the requirements for being colors: how did\nthe ordinary concept develop? A plausible answer to this problem is\nfound in the fact that the way that the concepts of color operate, to\nserve their various functions and roles, is through the way colors\nappear. For these purposes and roles, objects do not need to have\ncolors. It will be sufficient if they appear to have them. For these\npurposes, it is sufficient that “it is as if they have the\ncolors”. We should also bear in mind that errors and illusions\nand misrepresentations can be beneficial and not deleterious,\nespecially if the errors are systematic. Consider, for example, the\nhighly useful illusions that mirrors produce. Part of the point of\nProjectivist theories of color experience is that the errors are\nsystematic ones. Putting it crudely, tomatoes give us, regularly the\nsame kind of error, just as bananas give us their distinctive kind of\nerror. Angela Mendelovici has developed an account of reliable\nmisrepresentation. Interestingly, she argues that one of the\nobjections to tracking theories of representation, favored by\nReductive Color Physicalists, is that they cannot explain reliable\nmisrepresentation. \nFinally, the reason why color vision evolved might be quite complex.\nAkins and Hahn (2014) have a long, detailed, paper about the\nevolutionary implications of color vision. They argue the reasons\noften assumed doesn’t stack up: they are based on the notion\nthat the function of color vision is “to detect the\ncolors”. Things are far more complex, they argue. \nColor-Dispositionalism is the view that colors are dispositional\nproperties: powers to appear in distinctive ways to perceivers (of the\nright kind), in the right kind of circumstances; i.e., to cause\nexperiences of an appropriate kind in those circumstances. Because\nthey involve responses on the part of color-perceivers, such theories\nare often called “subjectivist”. \nThis theory takes different forms. One form it takes is that\nassociated with people in the scientific tradition, e.g., Descartes,\nBoyle, Newton and Locke. This is the view that colors are secondary\nqualities. However, as we saw earlier, in\n section 1.2,\n this form of the dispositionalist view was part of a complex package,\nrelated to the emerging scientific world-view. For our current\npurposes, there are two crucial components to this package. The first\nis the idea that we should distinguish between two notions of color:\ncolor as a property of physical bodies, and color as it is in\nsensation (or, as it is sometimes described,\n“color-as-we-experience-it”). The second is that the\nsecondary quality view is not thought of as capturing the\ncommon-sense, or “vulgar”, way of thinking of color.\nRather, it is thought of as a revision or reconstruction of the\nordinary concept.  \nThere is a different form the dispositionalist view of colors has more\nrecently taken, and which has many philosophical defenders, e.g.,\nBennett (1971), Dummett (1979), McDowell (1985), McGinn (1983),\nPeacocke (1984), Johnston (1992), and Levin (2000). These philosophers\nreject the claim that the dispositionalist view is in conflict with\nany commonsense view of color. It is held by some that\ndispositionalism can be defended as an analytic thesis, concerning the\nmeaning of color terms; it is held, or implied, by others that\npossession of the concept of color is neutral on the precise nature of\nthe colors, a nature which consists in being dispositional. One virtue\nof this account is that, if it is correct, there is no need to agree\nthat science is in conflict with our intuitive notions of color, or\nthat it shows that ordinary color talk is mistaken, or in need of\nreconstruction. Another virtue would be that it would explain what\nseems to be an important feature of color concepts, as opposed to\nprimary quality concepts: that in order to grasp, fully, color\nconcepts, it is necessary to have color experiences. (It is\ninteresting that, as Adams (2016) points out, Aristotle’s\naccount of color rejects this assumption: For Aristotle, the function\nof vision is to detect colors, perceiver-independent colors.) \nA prominent defender of dispositionalism is Johnston (1992), whose\naccount of the major constraints upon a theory of color we examined in\nan earlier section. He concedes that dispositionalism has difficulty\nhandling the constraint imposed by commitment to the doctrine of\nRevelation but, he thinks, giving this up is a small price to pay. He\nmaintains that, nevertheless, the theory can handle all the other\nconstraints, and in so doing has major advantage over rival accounts.\nOne of the theory’s merits is that it can account for the\nPrinciple of Unity, item (3) in his list, although as we have seen,\nthis principle needs to be extended. Another merit of Johnston’s\nversion of dispositionalism is that it handles what seems to be a\ndifficulty for other versions, the problem of explaining the causal\nrole of color in the perception of colors, that is to say, the problem\nof meeting constraint (2) on his list: \nIt has been argued that dispositionalist accounts of color cannot\nhandle this causal requirement, e.g., Jackson 1998. Johnston’s\nreply to this objection is that the dispositions do not have to be\nthought of as bare dispositions. We can, instead, think of them as\n“constituted dispositions”, which are thought of as\nfollows:  \nA constituted disposition is a higher-order property of having some\nintrinsic properties which, oddities aside, would cause the\nmanifestation of the disposition in the circumstances of\nmanifestation. (Johnston 1992 [1997: 147])  \nThus it is part of what it is to have a constituted disposition to\nhave some property, which is the causal ground of the manifestation of\nthe disposition. \nThere have been two major objections to dispositionalism. These have\nbeen discussed (and rejected) by J. Levin (2000). One objection is that\nthe dispositionalist theory cannot give a satisfactory account of the\nphenomenology of visual color experiences.  Let us come back to this\nobjection. The second major problem is that it cannot dissolve what\nmany think is the central problem of dispositionalism, the problem of\ncharacterizing just what the colors of objects are supposed to be,\n“without vacuity, circularity, regress or any other such\ndamaging vice” (Levin 2000: 162). The circularity problem\nreflects the way the dispositionalist thesis is usually\nformulated: \nX is red = X has the disposition to look red to normal\nperceivers, in standard conditions.  \nIf we understand the phrase “to look red”, on the right\nhand side, to mean “to look to be red”, then it would seem\nwe have troubles. As Levin puts it: \nIf an object is red iff it’s disposed to look red (under\nappropriate conditions), then an object must be disposed to look red\niff it’s disposed to look to be disposed to look red …\nand so on, ad infinitum. (Levin 2000: 163)  \nThere is a range of techniques that Dispositionalists have devised to\navoid the circularity problem. They include proposals to understand\n“looks red” differently from that assumed above, and\nproposals to characterize the disposition differently. In addition, it\nis sometimes argued that the circularity is benign. (For further\ndiscussion, see Levin 2000, and Byrne & Hilbert 2011.) \nOne particularly interesting solution to the circularity problem is\nthat provided by Peacocke 1984/1997. Peacocke defends what he calls an\n“experientialist’s version” of the theory, one which\nrequires the introduction of a third property, besides those of being\nred, and looking red—a sensational property, that of being red*.\nAccording to this account, the property red is explained not in terms\nof looking red, but in terms of causing the perceiver to have\npresented to him, sensational properties in a visual field. (For\ndiscussion, see Boghossian and Velleman 1989/1997) \nThe more pressing problem, however, for Color Dispositionalism is\nwhether it can give an adequate account of the phenomenology of visual\nexperience. The phenomenological problem, as McGinn describes it, is\nthat color properties do not look much like dispositions to produce\ncolor experiences, so that an error theory of color perception comes\nto seem inescapable. Colors turn out not to look the way they are said\ndispositionally to be, “which is to say that ordinary color\nperception is intrinsically and massively misleading” (McGinn\n1996: 537). Rather than adopting a dispositionalism with that\nconsequence, McGinn falls back on a Primitivist view of color, a view\nthat resists both criticisms leveled at dispostionalism. \nLevin 2000 has provided a powerful reply, on behalf of the\ndispositionalist, to McGinn’s argument. Her challenge is\ncomplex, highlighting the assumptions that underpin McGinn’s\ncriticism (and has a detailed discussion of the relevance of the\ndoctrine of Revelation). An important question seems to remain,\nhowever. In McGinn’s formulation of the phenomenological\nproblem, there are two distinct claims, each of which is crucial: (1)\nColors do not look like the sorts of dispositional properties they\nwould have to be if the dispositional thesis were correct:\n“Colors turn out not to look the way they are said\ndispositionally to be”. (2) colors look like non-dispositional\nproperties: when we see an object as red we see it as having a simple,\nmonadic, local property of the object’s surface. \nThe second claim is expanded as follows: \nWhen we see an object as red … [the] color is perceived as\nintrinsic to the object, in much the same way that shape and size are\nperceived as intrinsic. No relation to perceivers enters into how the\ncolor appears; the color is perceived as wholly on the object, not as\nsomehow straddling the gap between it and the perceiver. (McGinn 1996:\n541–542)  \nOne possibility that this claim raises is that even if it is true, as\nLevin argues, that our visual experiences are such that objects look\nto have dispositional properties of the sort the\ncolor-dispositionalist is committed to, it will also be the case\n(often at least) that the colored objects look to be manifesting that\ndisposition. McGinn’s claim (2) may then apply to the\nmanifestation of the disposition. If so, the dispositionalism would\nseem to be allied to an error theory, as he suggests. \nByrne and Hilbert (2011) provide a detailed examination of Color\nDispositionalism, which they stress, can take different forms. They\nthink that several of these forms can escape both the circularity and\nphenomenological problems, highlighted by McGinn, in part because they\ndisagree with him on the phenomenology. They have different criticism\nof the theory: that there is no good reason for accepting the theory.\nThey argue that the best reasons for accepting it depend on a highly\nimplausible theory of perception. \nFinally, another difficulty with dispositionalism, as it is standardly\nexpressed, is the one that Hardin (1988/1993, 2004) has stressed. As our knowledge of color vision\nhas grown, it has become increasingly more difficult to specify normal\nobservers, and standard viewing conditions in any but an arbitrary\nway, arbitrary from the point of view of metaphysics. To be sure,\nthere are conventional reasons for picking out some observers and some\nviewing conditions as special, but we can, without too much trouble,\nimagine these changing. And with respect to normal observers, we have\nfound that in fact, as things stand, there is a wide range of\nvariation among competent color perceivers. As we shall see in the\nfollowing section, these considerations have led Cohen to modify the\nstandard dispositionalist account in favor of a “more\necumenical” color relationalist theory, one that relativizes the\ndispositions to groups of perceivers, and types of viewing\nconditions. \nOne of the most important developments in recent philosophy of color\nhas been the emergence of a radical relationalist view of colors.\nAverill (1992) proposed a relational view of color, one that involves\na strong modification of the standard dispositional position. He\npresents two arguments against both physicalist and dispositionalist\naccounts, which depend on raising difficult questions for their\ndependence on normal observers and standard viewing conditions. In\ntheir place, he offers an account according to which colors of bodies\nare relational properties. In explanation, he asks us to:  \nSuppose that “yellow” is regarded as a relational term\nhaving two suppressed argument places, one argument takes populations\nas values and ties any instance of being yellow to the normal\nobservers of a population, the other takes environments as values and\nties any instance of being yellow to the optimal viewing conditions of\nan environment. (Averill 1992: 555)  \nCohen (2004, 2009) holds a similar position, though he has produced a\nmore general argument. For Cohen, Color Relationalism is the\nmetaphysical thesis that colors are relational properties of a certain\nsort—relational with respect to perceivers and circumstances of\nviewing. According to Color Relationalism, there are no such\nproperties as blue, red, yellow,\norange, etc. To be more precise, there are no such properties\nas blue simpliciter, red simpliciter, and so on. What there\nare, instead, are relational properties: blue-for-perceiver\nA-in-circumstances C1, red-for-perceiver\nB-in-circumstances C2, yellow-for-perceiver\nD-in-circumstances C3, and so on. \nAt the heart of Cohen’s account is a certain argument, which he\ncalls his “Master Argument”. This argument depends on\npointing out the extent to which the colors things look to have, vary\nwith different viewing conditions, different classes of perceivers,\nand different types of animals. In short, it is built upon the premise\nthat there is a vast range of situations in which there are variations\nin the way something looks, either to the same subject under different\nviewing conditions, or to different subjects under the same\nconditions. \nThen follows the crucial question: Can we select one amongst these\nperceptual variants that should be regarded as veridically\nrepresenting the color of the object (where this would mean that the\nother variants are representing the object’s color erroneously)?\nIt is just this question, Cohen suggests, to which it is difficult to\nimagine a well-motivated, principled, and non-question-begging answer,\nand thus leads to the formulation of the Master Argument. Given that\nthere is no well-motivated reason for singling out any single variant\n(at the expense of the others), he argues, an ecumenical\nreconciliation of the variants is preferable to an unmotivated\nstipulation in favor of just one of them. He concludes: the best way\nto implement such an ecumenical reconciliation between apparently\nincompatible variants is to view them as the result of relativizing\ncolors to different values of different parameters (Cohen 2009:\n24). \nThe thrust of the Master Argument, powerful as it is, is largely\nnegative. It seems to rebut all objectivist theories of color, whether\nthe objectivist theory is one of the standard forms of color\nrealism—physicalist realism or primitivist realism—or\nwhether it is framed in terms of a disposition to appear, in\ncharacteristic ways, to normal perceivers in standard circumstances.\nOn the face of it, only two candidates remain: Color Relationalism and\nColor Irrealism. Cohen holds that Color Relationalism provides the\nbest solution to the problem outlined, but he concedes that Color\nIrrealism also offers a solution. He thinks that that view ought to be\nrejected, on independent grounds. The argument against Color Irrealism\nis that it is a “theory of last resort”, one that we\nshould accept only after all other candidates have been rejected, when\nno other alternative remains. The crucial issue between these two\ntheories, it would seem, is when Color Relationalism can account\nadequately for the phenomenology of visual experience. Cohen’s\nresponse to this problem is similar to that of Levin, in her defense\nof Color Dispositionalism (see Maund 2012). \nThere are other forms of color relationalism which deserve a section\nof their own. They tend to see colors as hybrid properties combining\naspects of the perceiver’s environment and phenomenology. \nOne form has links to action-based theories of perception, as\ndeveloped principally by the psychologist, J. J. Gibson. A leading\nexample is the theory defended by Evan Thompson, The Ecological\nView of Colors. On this account, colors are taken to be\ndependent, in part, on the perceiver and so are not intrinsic\nproperties of a perceiver-independent world. Being colored, instead,\nis construed as a relational property of the environment, connecting\nthe environment with the perceiving animal. In the case of the color\nof physical surfaces, “being coloured corresponds to the surface\nspectral reflectance as visually perceived by the animals”\n(Thompson 1995: 240; see also Ch. 5, pp. 242–250).\n \nIn more detail this account is spelled out in the following way:  \nbeing coloured a particular determinate colour or shade … is\nequivalent to having a particular spectral reflectance, illuminance,\nor emittance that looks that colour to a particular perceiver in\nspecific viewing conditions. (1995: 245)  \nThompson insists that this account is to be distinguished from both a\nLockean dispositionalist account and an error theory of colors.\nWhether it is or not will depend on what account he can give of\n“as visually perceived by the animal”. \nAnother important example of an action-based approach to perception is\nthe theory in Noë 2004. Noë defends what he calls the\nenactive approach to perception. As in the case of Thompson, his\ntheory is guided by Gibson’s work, albeit with modification.\nNoë sets his view of color within this account, arguing that\ncolor is a relational property, involving the object and the\nenvironment, and crucially related to perceivers. In his theory of\nperception, Noë emphasizes the role of perspectival properties.\nHe distinguishes, for example, between size and perspectival size,\ni.e., size in the visual field or how things look with\nrespect to size from here. \nSize in the visual field is distinct property from size. It\ncorresponds to the size of the patch that one must fit in on given\nplane perpendicular to the line sight in order to perfectly occlude an\nobject from view. (Noë 2004: 83)  \nActually, Noë makes a distinction between three kinds of\nproperties. Associated with the shape (and size) of an object, say, a\ncube, is its visual potential: \nThe visual potential of a cube (at least with respect to\nshape) is the way its aspect changes as a result of movement (of the\ncube itself or of the perceiver around the cube). Any movement\ndetermines a set of changes in perceived aspect; any set of changes in\nperceived aspects determines equivalent classes of possible movements,\n(Noë 2004: 77)  \nAccordingly, in the case of shape and size, we can distinguish between\nthree kinds of properties: e.g., vision-independent shape,\nshape’s visual potential and perspectival shape. Noë models\nhis theory of color on the second kind of property: “colors are\nways colored things change their appearances as color-critical\nconditions change” (Noë 2004: 141). This is an intriguing\ntheory. What isn’t so clear is what exactly perspectival color\nis. \nMore recently, other forms of relational theories have emerged:\ntheories defended by Brogaard (2012), Chirimuuta (2015), and\nChirimuuta & Kingdom (2015). Chirimuuta advocates a version of\ncolor relationalism which she calls Color Adverbialism: \nOn this last account, colors are not properties of external physical\nobjects, or of brains, or of our mental states; instead, they are\nproperties of perceptual processes or interactions which involve\nobjects, brains and mental states. So, according to colour\nadverbialism, “seeing the colours” means “seeing in\na colourful way”. (Chirimuuta & Kingdom 2015: 226)  \nShe appeals, with Kingdom, to recent research on color vision, relied\nto the function of color vision, to argue that it provides great\ndifficulties for Objectivist color realism—both Primitivist and\nReductionist Physicalist—(see also Akins & Hahn 2014). While\nthey admit that anti-realism, especially the form favored by Hardin,\nis in a better position, they think that Color Adverbialism presents\nthe best explanation. \nAnother important recent contributions to the philosophy of color is\nthe book by Matthen (2005). In this work, Matthen articulates a theory\nof sense-perception in which color plays a prominent role. The work is\nsignificant for the theory of color that he presents, one that draws\nheavily on comparative studies of color vision among different\nspecies. Matthen replaces his earlier objectivist views on color by an\naccount that has more in common with the ecological theory favored by\nThompson. Matthen agrees with Hardin, Thompson and others that the\nphenomenology of color is not captured, or accounted for, by any of\nthe standard objectivist accounts. Nevertheless, he claims to be\ndefending a realist theory of color and to be rejecting standard\nirrealist theories, including Hardin’s. Matthen’s account\nis complex. The idea is that the senses (the visual sensory system) do\ncategorize objects as “blue”, “yellow”, etc.,\nbut these qualities are related to actions that perceivers can\nperform, and in particular, to “epistemic affordances”.\nThe sensory systems are held to be devices that are in the business of\nclassifying distal stimuli (physical objects) as having certain\nproperties, which stand in similarity and difference relations with\neach other. These categories are constructed by the system and do not,\nat least in the case of color, correspond to any objective properties\nthat are independent of perceivers.","contact.mail":"barry.maund@uwa.edu.au","contact.domain":"uwa.edu.au"}]
