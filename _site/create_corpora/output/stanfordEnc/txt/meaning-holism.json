Holism draws much of its appeal from the way in which\nthe usage of all our words seems interconnected, and runs into many\nproblems because the resultant view can seem to conflict with (among\nother things) the intuition that the meanings of individual words are\nby and large shared and stable.\n\n\nThis entry will examine the strengths of the arguments for and against\nmeaning holism.\n\nThe label “meaning holism” is generally applied to views\nthat treat the meanings of all of the words in a language as\ninterdependent. Meaning holism is typically contrasted with\natomism about meaning (where each word’s meaning is\nindependent of every other word’s\n meaning),[1]\n and molecularism about meaning (where a word’s meaning\nis tied to the meanings of some comparatively small subset of other\nwords in the language—such as “kill” being tied to\n“cause” and “die” or “if …\nthen…” being tied to “not” and\n“or”). \nThe view is often traced to Quine’s claims that “It is\nmisleading to speak of the empirical content of an individual\nstatement” (Quine 1951: 43), and that “the unit of\nempirical significance is the whole of science” (Quine 1951:\n42), and one finds an even earlier statement of it in Hempel’s\nassertion that \nthe cognitive meaning of a statement in an empirical language is\nreflected in the totality of its logical relationships to all other\nstatements in the language. (Hempel 1950: 59) \nThe interdependence associated with meaning holism is usually taken to\nfollow from the meaning of each word (or sentence) being tied to its\nuse, with this “use” typically being understood in terms\nof (1) all of the beliefs that could be expressed with (the words in)\nit (Bilgrami 1992; Davidson 1984), or (2) all of the inferences it is\ninvolved in (Block 1986, 1998; Harman 1973; Sellars 1974). The\n“belief-focused” and “inference-focused” ways\nof characterizing use-based holism are often treated as\n interchangeable,[2]\n and will be so treated here unless the distinction is particularly\nrelevant in a\n context,[3]\n and so for our purposes here, meaning holism will be understood as\nthe following general view: \nThe determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a\nway that leads a change in the meaning of any single term to produce a\nchange in the meanings of each of the rest. \nSome arguments for meaning holism are “direct” in that\nthey provide a substantive account of what meaning is, and then argue\nthat if that is what meaning is, then meaning holism must follow.  \nFor instance, meaning holism seems to result from radical\n use-theories[4]\n that attempt to identify meaning with some aspects of our\nuse. Examples of this could be: \nIdentifying meaning with the beliefs associated with a word or its\ninferential/functional role leads quickly to a type of meaning holism\nbecause of the way that the connections between such beliefs and\ninferences spread through a language. For instance, a word like\n“squirrel” might be inferentially connected to, say,\n“animal” which is in turn connected to “Koala”\nwhich is connected to “Australia”, and through similar\nchains, every word will be related inferentially to (and thus\nsemantically entangled with) every other term in the language\n(especially when one considers connections like that between, say,\n“is a squirrel” and “is not a building” or any\nother thing we take squirrels not to be). Changing the meaning of one\nword thus changes the content of at least some of the inferences and\nbeliefs that constitute the meaning of other terms in the language,\nand so a change in the meaning of one term quickly leads to a change\nin the meaning of the rest. \nSuch fine-grained conceptions of meaning are often motivated by the\nthought that only holistically structured meanings that were so tied\nto our beliefs or to the inferences that we were disposed to make\ncould adequately serve the purposes of psychological explanation\n(either to deal with Frege-cases (Bilgrami 1992, 1998), to match the\nfact that understanding itself is holistic (Brandom 2011: 24; Heal\n1994), or to just specify an internalistically determined\n“narrow” content (Block\n 1995)).[5]\n Most such arguments crucially rely on a sub-argument with something\nlike the following general form: \nSemantic atomists usually deny the first premise of this argument, and\nsemantic molecularists deny the second, and so “indirect”\narguments for meaning holism usually take the form of arguing against\natomism and molecularism.  \nAs stated above, indirect arguments try to bolster the case for\nmeaning holism by undermining the case for its most obvious rivals.\nMolecularism about meaning may initially be the most appealing\nalternative to holism, and indeed, finding a principled way of trying\nto stop the “spreading effect” that seems to follow from\ntaking inferences as relevant to meaning has long been one of the main\nobjectives for molecularists about meaning (Devitt 1993, 1996; Dummett\n1973). Molecularist theories typically try to keep the idea that\nmeaning is tied to inferential role, but insist that only\nsome of the inferences involved with a term constitute its\nmeaning. However, drawing a clear line between the\nmeaning-constitutive and non-meaning-constitutive inferences/beliefs\nseems to commit one to a version of the analytic/synthetic distinction\nthat has been out of favor since Quine’s attack on it (Quine\n 1951),[7]\n and it is a familiar criticism of molecularism that it is an unstable\nresting point between atomism and holism, so that once you give up the\nformer, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find compelling reasons\nnot to move all the way to the latter (Fodor and Lepore 1992, but see\nDevitt 1996). \nWhile there have been some attempts to make the distinction without\nbuying into the analytic/synthetic distinction, or to argue that some\nversion of the analytic/synthetic distinction isn’t that bad\nafter all (Boghossian 1996, 2001, 2003; Devitt 1996; Horwich 2005;\nPacherie 1994; Peacocke 1995, 1997; Russell 2008), such views remain\ncontroversial, and an obvious way to avoid the slippery slope into\nmeaning holism is to not even make the first step towards molecularism\nand just keep one’s semantics atomistic (Fodor and Lepore\n1992). \nAtomistic semantic theories tend to be causal theories, and\nthese tend to fall into two types: backward and forward looking.\nHolists (and other critics of atomism) typically argue that both types\nof causal account face serious difficulties if they are to remain\natomistic. \nBackward looking causal theories inspired by Kripke (1972) and Putnam\n(1975) might have initially seemed like candidates for an atomistic\nsemantics. If what I meant by “cat” were determined by a\ncausal chain leading back to the kind that prompted the first\n“that’s a cat” utterance, then one might think that\nthe determinants of the meaning of each term could be distinct in the\nway that atomism requires. However, this initial attempt to restrict\nthe determinants to a set of initial baptisms quickly ran aground on\nvarious counterexamples (such as the discussion of\n“Madagascar” (Evans 1973)), and the realization that some\nbeliefs about sortals were needed (since the objects we would\nencounter at any “baptism” could be counted as instances\nof any number of\n kinds),[8]\n resulted in a the view sliding increasingly towards something that\nwas at least molecularist in\n structure.[9] \nForward looking causal theories (which look ahead to the items that\nour concepts cause us to apply terms to rather than back to the ones\nthat first caused us to form the concept), such as those presented by\nwriters working in what can roughly be called “Information\nSemantics” (Dretske 1981; Fodor 1987, 1990; Stampe 1979), also\nattempt to develop semantic theories that are typically atomistic. The\ntype of use that such atomistic theories must take meaning to be\ndetermined by are typically single applications like “cat”\nor at best “That’s a cat”, since any more complex\nexamples of use (such as sentences like “cats are mammals”\nor “cats like milk”) run the risk of tying the meaning of\n“cat” to our use of other words in the language (and thus\nto the factors that determine their meaning). However, underwriting a\ndistinction between correct and incorrect use while appealing only to\nsuch simple assertions has proved to be extremely difficult, and there\nis no consensus even among the proponents of such atomistic approaches\nabout what is the most promising way to tackle the problem (see the\ndiscussion of “the disjunction problem” in Adams &\nAizawa 2010). It has been tried in terms of optimal conditions\n(Papineau 1987), contexts where the term was learned (Dretske 1981)\nasymmetric causal dependence (Fodor 1990), but no such account has\ndone a convincing job of preventing classifications that intuitively\nseem to be errors from being built into the purported extensions of\nour terms. Indeed, it has been argued that the checks on our\ndispositions that these atomistic theories need to get\ntruth-conditions right must include the collateral commitments that\nspeakers have in particular contexts, and that appealing to these will\nlead away from atomism (Boghossian 1989, 1990 (drawing on Kripke\n1982); Jackman 2003b; Podlaskowski 2010).  \nFurthermore, both the backward and forward looking causal theories run\ninto trouble when dealing with parts of the language other than the\nsorts of kind terms upon which their defenders typically focus. For\ninstance, both sorts of causal theories seem ill-suited for dealing\nwith parts of the language like “big”, “of”,\n“quickly”, or “unless”, none of which invite\nthe same sort of isolated use that “red” or\n“cat”\n might.[10]\n The atomist might seem to require a different semantic\ntheory for these others parts of speech, while the holist and\nmolecularist can allow that the story about how every word acquires\nits value is uniform throughout the language. \nThe meaning holist thus can argue that both atomism and molecularism\nabout meaning face serious\n problems.[11]\n However, unlike the direct arguments, which can establish meaning\nholism in virtue of giving a substantive account of meaning, indirect\narguments typically just make holism seem more plausible by ruling out\nsome of the major alternatives. In particular, meaning holism in the\nsense focused on here isn’t simply entailed by the denial of\natomism and molecularism. The denial of atomism and molecularism leads\nto, at best, the following view: \nThe determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a\nway that leads a change in the determinants the meaning of\nany single term to produce a change in the determinants of the\nmeanings of each of the\n rest.[12] \nTo get from this view to full-fledged meaning holism, namely, \nThe determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a\nway that leads a change in the meaning of any single term to\nproduce a change in the meanings of each of the rest. \nOne needs to add the assumption that the function from the\ndeterminants of meaning to the meanings themselves is one-to-one (that\nis, not only does any change to a word’s meaning require some\nchange in the determinants of its meaning, but also that any change to\nthe determinants of a word’s meaning must produce a change to\nits meaning), and doing that will probably require something more like\na “direct” argument, since it is unlikely that one could\nargue that the function from use to meaning had to be one-to-one\nwithout some sort of substantial account of how use determined\nmeaning. \nThe most common objections to meaning holism relate to three topics:\ncompositionality, instability and objectivity.  \nAn initial problem with meaning holism is that it seems to conflict\nwith the presumed compositionality of language (Fodor & Lepore\n2002). Semantics is supposed to explain, among other things, how the\nmeanings of sentences and complex terms are a function of the meanings\nof their parts, and meaning holism appears to stand in the way of such\nan approach. If meaning were, say, inferential role, then the\ninferential role of, for instance, “pet fish” would follow\nfrom the inferential roles of “pet” and\n“fish”, but while one can typically infer “weighs\nless than three ounces” from “is a pet fish”, this\ninference follows neither from “is a pet” or “is a\nfish” nor from a combination of those two sets of inferences. In\nshort, they argue: \nHolists have a number of responses to this argument.  \nOne of these is to insist (following Block 1993: 42) that as long as\nwe can count “weighs less than three ounces if it’s a\nfish” as part of the inferential role of “it’s a\npet” then inferential roles would compose in just the way that\nFodor and Lepore deny. Block argues that any attempt to keep\n“weighs less than three ounces if it’s a fish” out\nof the inferential role of “pet” would already presuppose\nthe denial of holism, so the compositionality argument isn’t an\nindependent argument against holism since it already presupposes its\ndenial.  \nAnother is to follow Brandom in arguing that although, properly\nunderstood, a holistic semantics is “not\ncompositional”, it can still be “fully\nrecursive” (Brandom 2008: 135).  That is to\nsay, while Brandom denies that the meanings of complex expressions can\nbe determined solely from the meanings of their components, he still\ninsists that the meanings of expressions at one level of complexity\nare determined by the meanings of the expressions at the level below,\nand that this recursivity can be used to explain the facts about\nsystematicity and language learning that compositionality is often\ninvoked to\n explain.[13]\n Of course, one could still insist that a language whose semantics was\nactually compositional might be still more systematic, and\neasier to learn. However, the compositionality argument\nagainst meaning holism needs to show more than just that it would be\neasier for us if our semantics were compositional, it needs\nto show that our semantics must be compositional, and this\nassumption is what Brandom’s argument hopes to undercut. \nBoth of these responses suggest that while meaning holism may make\ngiving a compositional/recursive semantics hard, it does not\nmake it impossible. However, this leads to a related argument against\nmeaning holism that stresses (with Stanley 2008) that the project of\nproviding a semantics for our language within an atomistic framework\n(in which, say, the semantic value of “dog” is tied to the\nset of dogs), has been noticeably more productive than any attempt to\ndo so within a molecular or holistic framework (where, say, the\nsemantic value of “dog” is a set of inferences or some\nother property of the word’s\n use).[14]\n While it may be possible that a holistic inferential semantics may\neventually catch up with the results achieved by more traditional\natomistic truth-conditional semantics (see the discussion in and\nfollowing Stanley 2006, Other Internet Resources), the results of the\nsemantic programs thus far may suggest that we should favor meaning\natomism over meaning holism unless given good reasons to do\notherwise. \nWorries about compositionality aside, most of the problems associated\nwith meaning holism are tied to the way in which it seems to make\nmeaning idiosyncratic and\n unstable.[15]\n If what one meant by a term were individuated in terms of, say,\nall of the beliefs or inferences that one was disposed to\nmake with it, then two people (or one person at two times) would only\nmean the same thing by any of their terms if all of\ntheir beliefs or inferential dispositions were identical. In\neffect, meaning holism threatens to erase the distinction between\nchange/differences of meaning and change/differences of belief, so\nthat every time I change any one my beliefs, I change the meanings of\nall of my terms, and any time two people fail to share a single\nbelief, the meaning of all their terms and the content of all of their\nbeliefs must\n differ.[16] \nInstability presents problems for the meaning holist in the following\nareas: \nChange of Mind. I can’t, strictly speaking,\nchange my mind about any particular proposition, since if I went from\nbelieving, say, “Dogs are good pets” to believing\n“Dogs are not good pets”, what I mean by\n“Dog” and “Pet” would have changed. As a\nresult, there is no proposition that I previously thought to be true\nthat I now treat as false. However, since the most natural way to make\nsense of changing one’s mind about something is in terms of\nchanging the truth-value one assigns to a single proposition, the\nintuitive notion of change of mind seems lost. (Fodor and Lepore\n2002) \nDisagreement. In much the same way, it’s\nnatural to think of disagreement in terms of two people assigning\ndifferent truth values to the same proposition, but if meaning holism\nis true, no two people could disagree over a single proposition, since\nif they didn’t both accept a particular sentence, then they must\ndiffer in what they mean by it, in which case their differing\nattitudes don’t constitute a disagreement. (Fodor and Lepore\n 2002)[17] \nCreative Inference. Creative inference also seems\nproblematic for the meaning holist. One could rehearse the inferential\nrelations between things one already believed, but one couldn’t\nvalidly draw new conclusions, since if the conclusion of the inference\nis something that one didn’t believe already, then the terms in\nthat conclusion will mean something different than what the seemingly\nidentical terms meant in the premises, making the inference\n invalid.[18]\n (The inference could, of course, later be recapitulated as a valid\none, since at that point the meaning of the terms in the premises\nwould have changed as well, but this is just to say that the\nrecapitulation doesn’t capture the transitions that were\nactually going on when the inference was first taking place.) \nLanguage Learning. Learning a language would be\nproblematic, since it seems as if one couldn’t learn any\npart of a given language until one had mastered all of\nit. (Dummett 1973: 597–600, 1976: 44, 1991: 221, see also Bilgrami\n1986, Dresner 2002, Jönsson 2014) Of course, one could argue that on\nthis holistic view, there are no “languages” to learn,\njust a series of changing idiolects, and at any point in one’s\nacquisition period, one would have mastered some idiolect.\nHowever, this in turn leads to the following problem. \nCommunication. Strictly speaking, informative\ncommunication would be impossible. No one would mean the same thing by\nany of their terms unless they shared all the same beliefs, in which\ncase, communication would be possible, but uninformative, and truly\nunderstanding the utterances of others would be impossible unless you\nalready knew everything that they believed. (Fodor 1987; Fodor and\nLepore 1992). \nPsychological Explanation. No intentional laws or\npsychological generalizations would be possible, since no two subjects\nwould, as a matter of fact, have beliefs with the same content. We\nassume that generalizations like “If someone is thirsty, and\nthey believe that there is a glass of water in front of them, then\n(all else being equal), they will try to drink from it” are well\nsupported, but this would require “believing that there is a\nglass of water in front of them” is an attitude that lots of\npeople have, and for the meaning holist, there are, strictly speaking,\nno such shared attitudes. (Fodor, 1987; Fodor and Lepore\n 1992)[19] \nThe Incredulous Stare. Finally, there is the plain\nfact that most people take it to be “obvious” that there\ncan be changes of belief without changes of meaning, and that when I\ncome to believe that there are four elephants in the Seattle Zoo, I\nhaven’t changed what I mean by “Elephant”. The\nincredulous stare is hardly a knockdown argument (especially in\nphilosophy), but it suggests that meaning holism comes with a\nsubstantial conceptual cost, and so requires equally substantial\nbenefits to compensate for it. \nThere are a number of ways that the meaning holist can attempt to\nanswer the objection that the view erases the distinction between\ndifferences/change of meaning and differences/changes of belief. These\ninclude: \nBiting the bullet. One could simply say that, in\nfact, there isn’t any real difference between\nchange of meaning and change of belief and that we never\nreally communicate, disagree, or change our mind, but\nit’s hard to imagine someone simply biting that bullet and\nleaving it at that. Nevertheless, some have endorsed a modified\nversion of the above, arguing that, at least strictly\nspeaking, we never communicate, disagree or change our mind, and\nthen providing an explanation of why things might appear otherwise,\nand how loosely speaking we do manage to communicate,\ndisagree, change our minds, etc. Which leads us to… \nSimilarity. Many holists have argued that while none\nof us ever mean precisely what our compatriots and former\nselves do by our terms, we can still explain communication, change of\nmind etc. in terms of the fact that the different things that we mean\nare still extremely similar, so while I don’t mean\nprecisely what my wife means by “cat”, I still\nmean something extremely similar to what she does because we share\nmost of our beliefs and inferences where that term is\nconcerned. (For versions of something like this approach, see Harman\n1973; Block 1986; Churchland 1998; Fultner 1998; Brandom 2007;\nSchroeder 2007; Jorgensen 2009; Rovane 2013, Dresner 2019; Pollock\n2020).  \nHowever, even if such an appeal to similarity worked for the case\nabove, there is the problem that for many terms, our total belief sets\nsimply aren’t all that similar. After all, the similarity\nresponse presupposes that most of the beliefs and inferences\nassociated with a particular word are shared, but even in a generous\nsense of sharing, one might think that the total belief set that I\nassociate with my name for Omaha, a city which I’ve never\nvisited, will not be even remotely similar to the belief set of\nsomeone who grew up there. \nFurthermore, while the appeal to similarity is very natural, it can be\nhard to spell out in detail since the intuitive sense in which, say,\nmy wife and I “share most of our beliefs and inferences”\nseems to presuppose just the sort of content identity that meaning\nholism makes problematic. One would like to say that I mean something\nsimilar to my wife by “cat” because, in spite of our\ndifferences, we both believe things like “cats make good\npets”, “cats are mammals”, “cats are typically\nsmaller than dogs”, etc. However, to say that we\n“share” these beliefs would be to assume that we mean the\nsame thing by “pet”, “mammal” and\n“dog”, which is something that the meaning holist is\ncommitted to denying. Strictly speaking, for the meaning holist, I\ndon’t share any beliefs and inferences with my\ncompatriots and past selves, and so similarity can’t be\nexplained in terms of shared beliefs and inferences (Fodor\n1998; Fodor and Lepore 1992, 1999).  \nOf course there may be other ways to pin down similarity, and one of\nthese can be seen to flow out from the approach found immediately\nbelow. \nNarrow Content and Wide Content. Another way of\nmaking biting the bullet more palatable is by arguing that what we\nmean by any word involves two parts, a “wide” meaning that\nis understood in terms of something atomistic like reference, and a\n“narrow” meaning that is closer to something holistic like\ninferential role (Block 1986, 1993, 1995; Field 1977). \nIf meaning holism is true only of the “narrow” meaning\nused for psychological explanation (Block 1993), then communication,\ndisagreement, change of mind etc. can be explained in terms of the\n“wide” truth-conditional meaning. In spite of our\ndifferent narrow meanings, I can communicate with a compatriot because\nour sentences like, say, “Pork chops are generally better in\nMemphis than in Portland” will have the same wide truth\nconditions in spite of their having different narrow meanings. In much\nthe same way, disagreement could be explained by the fact that a\nsingle sentence will have the same truth conditions for both me and my\ninterlocutor (even though we each tie it to different narrow\nmeanings), and so if I affirm it, and they deny it, then only one of\nus can be correct. \nThe “two factor” theory would also help support something\nlike the similarity response mentioned above in that narrow meanings\ncould be treated as similar if they embodied most of the\n“same” inferences where those inferences were themselves\ntyped in terms of having the same wide content. This would allow one\nto say that the narrow meanings of “cat” between my wife\nand I are very similar, since most of our “cat”-beliefs\nhave the same\n truth-conditions.[20] \nOf course, appeals to narrow content are not uncontroversial. The\nnotion seems more natural with belief content than linguistic meaning,\nand even for the former, there have been doubts raised about whether\nit really is a coherent notion of content at all (Bilgrami 1992;\nMcDowell 1986). Further, even if one accepts that there are these two\nsorts of content, we are left with the question of what holds the two\ntypes of meaning together. As Fodor and Lepore put it, why\ncouldn’t something have the same “narrow” meaning as\n“water” and at the same time refer to the number four?\n(Fodor and Lepore 1992: 170). This worry is most pronounced for\ntheories that, unlike the more traditional Fregean account where the\nmode of presentation is expected to determine reference,\nfollow those who “tend to suppose that a concept’s\nidentification procedure has nothing to do with its reference”\n(Margolis & Laurence 1999: 72). Such psychological factors making\nup the narrow content would thus be “merely associated”\nwith a wide content rather than helping determine\n it.[21] \nContextualism. Yet another way of dealing with the\nsort of instability associated with meaning holism is to appeal to\ncontext, rather than similarity, to ensure that\ncommunication, change of mind and the rest are possible. For instance,\nBilgrami (1992) argues that critics of meaning holism fail to\ndistinguish aggregate contents (which are tied to all of the\nagent’s beliefs) and local contents (which are only\ntied to those belief relevant in a particular communicative context).\nWhile meaning holism would have all the instability-related problems\nmentioned above at an aggregate level, at a local\nlevel (which is where communication and psychological explanation\nactually takes place), content identity can be\n preserved.[22]\n On such an account, only some of the beliefs/inferences\nassociated with a particular word will be active in any particular\ncontext, and so two people who might (indeed, will inevitably) mean\nsomething different at an aggregate level (at which we\nconsider all their beliefs) may still mean the same thing in\nany particular context, since the beliefs that they take to be\nrelevant in that context could be identical. In effect, one has\nsomething that looks like a type of molecularist view in each context,\nbut unlike the standard molecularist, who treats the\nmeaning-constitutive beliefs/inference as invariant across contexts,\nthe contextualist allows the relevant subset to change from situation\nto situation. \nFor instance, while the total set of beliefs associated with\n“sugar” varies greatly from person to person, if someone\nasks me whether I would like some sugar with my coffee, most of our\nidiosyncratic sugar-beliefs would be irrelevant, and in that context,\nonly the beliefs that sugar is sweet, has a certain color, texture and\ntaste will be active. Since those beliefs are probably shared, I am\nable to communicate with that person about sugar in that context even\nif we mean something different by the term at the\n“aggregate” level. \nHowever, this presupposes a lot about the contexts involved, and the\nassumption that even within a particular context, two people would\ntake the same beliefs/inferences to be relevant is not\nuncontroversial. Indeed, if I’m communicating novel information\nthat my interlocutor doesn’t know, this might always entail that\nI start off meaning something different than they do (though they may\ncome to share a meaning by accepting the claim). This worry would be\neven more pronounced when we try to move from communication to\ndisagreement, where, by hypothesis, there is a contextually relevant\nsentence involving the words in question that my interlocutor and I\ndon’t both accept. This problem could be avoided by insisting\nthat the focus of a conversation not be included in the context, and\nthat the local content simply be stipulated to only include what the\ntwo parties agree on (Bilgrami 1992: 146). However, such a restriction\nwould seem to make the resulting contents less suitable for\npsychological explanation, since the behavior of the speakers involved\nin a disagreement would likely be sensitive to their opinions on the\nissue about which they\n disagree.[23] \nStill, the appeal to context might be viewed as a supplement to,\nrather than alternative to, the similarity response. If the beliefs\nwere restricted to those relevant in a particular context, then even\nif they aren’t identical, it’s quite likely that the\nbelief sets will be similar even when, as in the case of\n“Omaha” above, the two speakers have very different total\nbeliefs sets associated with the word. Context would thus make appeals\nto ubiquitous similarity more plausible, and similarity could be used\nas a back up for those contexts which fail to produce context-relative\nidentity. \nAnti-Individualism. As stated above, instability\narises not from meaning holism per se, but from versions of\nmeaning holism motivated by an identification of meaning with some\naspect of use, and some of the problems relating to instability can be\nmitigated if the meaning holist loosens the connection between meaning\nand individual use. One natural way to do this is to take it\nto be the beliefs and inferences endorsed by a group rather\nthan an individual that determine a word’s meaning\n(Brandom 1994, 2000). On such an account, two different individuals\n(or one individual at two times) could mean the same thing by a word\neven if they endorse different inferences provided that both were\nmembers of a single social group that collectively endorses a single\nset of inferences or beliefs. Disagreement, communication, inference,\nand change of mind would all thus seem initially less puzzling for the\nmeaning holist if they happens to be an anti-individualist as\nwell. \nThis sort of anti-individualism might seem independently motivated by\nthe considerations raised in Tyler Burge’s “Individualism\nand the\n Mental”,[24]\n and it shares with Burge’s account the challenges of (1)\ndetermining just what beliefs or inferences are endorsed by a group or\nsociety (those of the majority, the experts, etc.) and (2)\nindividuating the relevant groups themselves. \nFurthermore, given that what is believed about anything even at a\nsocial level undoubtedly changes over time, and given the spreading\neffect endemic to meaning holism that leads a change in one element to\nultimately produce changes in the rest, one might expect that most of\nour terms will end up changing their meaning each day even for the\nanti-individualist meaning holist. For instance, if we allow that,\nsay, the experts determine what inferences or beliefs are tied to the\nmeaning of any particular term, then any changes to their\nterm-specific belief set will not only change the meaning of that\nterm, but also cascade down through the language to ultimately affect\nevery word just as it did in the individual case. Since some change in\nexpert belief about something happens every day, one might\nthink that we are still left in a state of comparative flux.\nConsequently, while the appeal to the social-determination of meaning\nallows for synchronic communication, disagreement, etc., the\ndiachronic sense of all of these are still undermined\n(unless, of course, this appeal to anti-individualism is combined with\nsome of the appeals to similarity, wide contents, or context discussed\n above).[25] \nFinally, this sort of answer to instability worries would not be\navailable to many meaning holists, who, like Block (1986, 1995), seem\ndriven to meaning holism by an interest in supplying a semantics for\nan explicitly individualistic psychology.  \nNormativity. The anti-individualistic response\npresented above, like most holistic accounts of meaning, focuses on\nthe inferences that speakers (or social groups) do make,\nrather than the ones that they should make. However, just as\nextensional accounts of meaning tie the meaning of a term to what we\nshould apply it to, not what we simply do apply it\nto, one might think that the holist could take a similar normative\napproach from the inferential side. If one takes this more normative\napproach to the inferences involved, many of the instability-based\nworries disappear. The inferences I do make with the term,\nsay, “gold” change over time and differ from those that my\ncompatriots make, but the inferences I should make with the\nterm are considerably more stable and shared. I may change what\ninferences I do make about gold’s atomic number, but the ones\nthat I should make with respect to it are stable (Brandom 1994, 2000:\n29). \nThere will, nevertheless, still be some instability even with this\nnormative account if we merely identify the inferences we should make\nwith all of the ones that are truth\n preserving.[26]\n For instance on such an account, while I should infer\n“is worth less per ounce than platinum” from “is\ngold”, if the price of gold were to go up enough, the validity\nof that inference would change. However, intuitively the meaning of\n“gold” should not be changing in a case like this. A\nsignificant change in gold’s price shouldn’t cause me to\nbe unable to understand gold-utterances of people before the price\nwent up, or view the meaning of “Susan loves gold” as\nopaque if I don’t know whether it was uttered before or after\nthe price\n spike.[27]\n That said, if the holist is making an appeal to similarity and\nwide-contents as well, then an isolated sentence like that would not\nbe much of a problem, since the vast majority of the inferences we\nshould make with the term would still be both constant and shared. \nOf course, like the anti-individualist response discussed above, the\nnormative response won’t be available to those meaning holists\nwho, like Block, motivate their holism in terms of a type of\nindividualistic functionalist psychology. \nA final group of objections to meaning holism stem from the assumption\nthat theories that tie what we mean by a term to some of the beliefs\nor inferences associated with it can seem to make the all of the\nmeaning-constitutive beliefs or inferences “true in virtue of\nmeaning”, and thus in a sense “analytically\n true”.[28]\n The meaning molecularist’s claim that their proposed\nmeaning-constitutive inferences need to be valid (say, if the meaning\nof “&” were identified with its elimination and\nintroduction rules, then one would need to treat “\\((A \\ \\&\\\nB) \\rightarrow A\\)” as true in virtue of meaning) isn’t\nentirely uncontroversial, but the assumption that meaning-constitutive\ninferences will be valid isn’t taken to be problematic even by\nthe critics of meaning molecularism (who argue instead that particular\ncandidates for meaning constitutive inferences can’t be\naccepted, since we can coherently doubt their validity (Burge 1986;\nWilliamson 2003)). However, while the meaning molecularist can at\nleast allow that we can make many mistakes, since most of our beliefs\nare not meaning constitutive, the meaning holist may seem to be\ncommitted to all of our beliefs being true, since all of them\ndetermine what we\n mean.[29]\n The issue isn’t so much that all such beliefs are true\n“in virtue of meaning”, but rather that they are all\ntreated by the meaning holist as simply true at all. Whether\nthe truth involved is analytic or not, it doesn’t seem like we\nshould have to treat all of any speaker’s beliefs as\ntrue. There are a number of responses to this worry, all of which\nappeal to strategies already canvassed in describing the meaning\nholist’s response to worries about instability. \nFor instance, one way to cut worries about objectivity short is to\nappeal to the narrow/wide content distinction discussed in\n 3.2.2,\n and claim that the meanings for which meaning holism holds are not\nthe sort that relate to truth.  Block, in particular, has\ninsisted that, since the contents for which meaning holism holds\ninvolve narrow meanings, the question of their truth\ndoesn’t come up. The “narrow analog” of analyticity\ndoesn’t produce analyticity in the traditional sense, and thus\nBlock can reject what he calls “The Plausible Sounding\nPrinciple”, namely: \nInferences that are part of inferential roles must be regarded by the\ninferential role theorist as analytic. For these inferences are what\nare taken to constitute meaning, and inferences that constitute\nmeaning are analytic. (Block 1993: 51) \nSince “determinate meaning facts about narrow meaning\ndo not engender analyticities” (Block 1993: 54), the analyticity\nworry won’t plague this sort of holist. Since narrow contents\nhave no truth values, “and hence have no truth\nconditions”, they simply aren’t the type of thing that\ncould be true in virtue of meaning, and thus “aren’t even\nthe sort of things that can be analytic” (Block 1993:\n61). \nAnother way for the meaning holist to mitigate worries about\nobjectivity is to adopt a version of the “contextualist”\napproach also mentioned in\n 3.2.2.\n On that view, since only some of one’s beliefs are relevant to\na term’s meaning in any context, one’s other beliefs can\nturn out to be false when evaluated from that context. However, while\nthis would allow for some false beliefs, one might worry whether it\ngoes far enough. Beliefs that speakers in a context didn’t agree\non could turn out to be false, but other inferences, inferences that\nintuitively seem fallible, turn out to be effectively analytic within\nthe relevant contexts. For instance if both my interlocutor and I\nbelieve “All sugar comes from sugarcane” in a context\nwhere that belief is relevant (we are, for instance, asked “Name\na product that comes exclusively from a single type of plant”)\nit would seem as if my answer “sugar” would have to be\ncorrect on the contextualist version of meaning holism, which it\ndoesn’t seem to\n be.[30] \nThe “anti-individualistic” and “normative”\nresponses to instability discussed in\n 3.2.2\n can also both do service in defending the meaning holist from worries\nabout objectivity. The anti-individualist strategy would do a good job\naccounting for individual error, since individual inferences\ncan be understood as mistaken in virtue of being out of line with the\npreferred social usage. Nevertheless, understanding how the preferred\nsocial usage (be it expert usage, majority usage, or something else)\ncould be mistaken would still be a problem on such an account. The\nnormative strategy, on the other hand, build’s a notion of\nobjectivity directly into the use appealed to, and so seems best\nplaced to respect the purported objectivity of our claims (the fact\nthat the inferences that we should make couldn’t turn\nout to be mistaken on such an account doesn’t seem particularly\ntroubling). However, as discussed in\n 3.2.2,\n both of the anti-individualistic and normative responses detach\nmeaning from individual use in a way that many meaning holists would\nfind unacceptable. \nMeaning holism thus comes with a number of costs (particularly\nrelating to instability and objectivity), and while there are a\nvariety of strategies available to make these costs more bearable, no\nsingle approach to doing so seems problem-free. That said, these\nstrategies can be complementary, and it may be the case that a\ncombination of them can do the work in a way that no single one of\nthem would be able to. In any case, being completely problem free is a\nvery high bar to set for a philosophical theory, and meaning holists\nare free to argue not only that the benefits that come with their view\noutweigh the costs, but also that the atomistic and molecularist\ntheories face equally severe problems of their own.","contact.mail":"hjackman@yorku.ca","contact.domain":"yorku.ca"}]
