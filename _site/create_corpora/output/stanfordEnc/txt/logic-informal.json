Informal logic is the attempt to build a logic suited to\nthis purpose. It combines the study of argument, evidence, proof and\njustification with an instrumental outlook which emphasizes its\nusefulness in the analysis of real life arguing.\n\n\nInformal logic is usually understood narrowly, as a contemporary field\nof study which emerged in the last half century, when many\nphilosophers and logicians turned their attention to the analysis,\nevaluation and improvement of real life argument. This contemporary\nendeavor can be understood much more broadly, as the continuation of\nmany older attempts by philosophers and others who have (since ancient\ntimes) proposed methods for understanding and assessing actual\n(“real life,” “everyday”) arguments.\n\n\nContributions to informal logic often address specific aspects of\nscientific, legal, and other specialized instances of reasoning, but\nthe overriding aim has been a general account of argument that can be\nused to explain and evaluate it in contexts of reflection, inquiry,\nsocial and political discussion, news, blogs and editorials,\nadvertising, corporate and institutional communication, and\ninterpersonal exchange.\n\n\nIn developing an account of argument, informal logicians have studied\ninference and a broad range of other relevant topics. The latter\ninclude, to take only a few examples: competing accounts of the nature\nof argument; criteria for argument evaluation; argument schemes;\nfallacies; deductive, inductive, and conductive models of inference;\nrhetorical and dialectical approaches to argument; onus and burden of\nproof; the empirical study of argument; argument diagramming (or\n“mapping”); cognitive biases; the history of argument\nanalysis; the role of emotion in argument; and the rules that govern\nargumentative exchange in different communicative contexts. \n\n\nHansen 2011 provides a survey of the methods of informal logic which\nemphasizes different approaches to the study and evaluation of\ninference in informal argument. Blair 2015 identifies two key tasks\nfor informal logic: the attempt to develop ways to identify (and\n“extract”) arguments from natural language discourse and\nthe attempt to develop methods and guidelines for assessing their\ncogency. \n\nThe pedagogical and practical interests that characterize informal\nlogic are already evident in ancient times. The First Sophistic is a\nmovement motivated by the notion that one can teach the art of\nlogos in a way that can be useful in public discussion and\ndebate. Aristotle’s rhetorical and logical works are especially\nnotable for their systematic attempts to understand and teach the\nprinciples of real life arguing. Within informal logic and\nargumentation theory, his views and general outlook remain relevant\ntoday. \nSignificant attempts to develop a systematic approach to informal\narguments emerge in early modern times. The Port Royal Logic\n(Arnauld & Nicole 1662), initially titled Logic or the Art of\nThinking, was first published in French in 1662. It quickly\nestablished itself as an often celebrated and sometimes disdained\nintroduction to the art of argument. Since its first publication, it\nhas enjoyed more than fifty French editions and five popular English\ntranslations. Describing logic as “the art of directing reason\naright, in obtaining the knowledge of things, for the instruction both\nof ourselves and others” (25), it provides a practical account\nof good and poor argument. Its account of logical methods discusses\nfallacies, syllogisms, definitions, deductive and probable reasoning,\namong other topics, emphasizing the discussion of real rather than\nconcocted examples of arguing (see Finocchiaro 1997). \nOne finds other analogues of today’s approaches to informal reasoning\nin nineteenth century textbooks which aim to improve everyday\nreasoning via public education that emphasizes logical and rhetorical\nconcerns. Richard Whatley is of special note in this regard. He began\nhis career as a professor of political economy at Oxford and was then\nappointed Archbishop of Dublin for the Church of Ireland. During his\ntime in office, he attempted to establish a national and non-sectarian\nsystem of education, writing texts on reasoning that could serve this\npurpose. In many ways, his Elements of Logic and Elements\nof Rhetoric (Whately 1826, 1830) are rough analogues of\ncontemporary textbooks of informal logic and argumentation theory. \nThe trends that give rise to informal logic as a unique discipline of\nstudy coalesce in North America in the late 1960s. This was a time\nwhen social upheaval and protests against the War in Vietnam\npopularized calls for an education that was relevant to the issues of\nthe day. In universities and colleges, this stimulated an interest in\nthe logic of everyday argument. One question this raised was the\nextent to which informal arguments could be studied and analyzed using\nthe methods of formal logic: propositional logic, truth tables,\nsyllogisms, and the predicate calculus. Many of those teaching\neveryday arguments criticized treatments like the ones found in Irving\nCopi’s popular (1953) Introduction to Logic (see Johnson 1996\nand Blair 2015). \nIn Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric: The Use of Reason in Everyday\nLife, Kahane 1971 embraced real life argument in a broad way,\nincluding a wide range of examples of real life arguing taken from\nnewspapers, the mass media, advertisements, books and political\ncampaigns. In comparison with Copi’s many concocted examples, other\nauthors did a better job melding classical formal logic with everyday\narguments. Harrison 1969 is a notable example. Pospesel published a\nnumber of texts which illustrate how the patterns of inference that\ncharacterize propositional and syllogistic logic appear in real life\ncontexts (see Pospesel and Marans 1978, Rodes and Pospesel 1991, and\nPospesel 2002). Little 1980 developed a critical thinking methodology\nfor everyday argument analysis and decision making which included\npropositional and syllogistic reasoning as critical components.  \nIn part because they wanted a much broader account of naturally\noccurring argument that they found in classical logic, Toulmin’s\nThe Uses of Argument (1958) and Hamblin’s Fallacies\n(1970) moved in new directions, developing alternative accounts of\nargument. Hamblin attempted to reinvigorate fallacies as an approach\nto understanding ordinary argument. In the development of informal\nlogic, their views have become theoretical touchstones for many\nseeking to develop an informal logic.  \nOne important catalyst for a systematic approach to informal argument\nwas the Critical Thinking Movement (described in Siegel 1988, Ennis\n2011). It argued that the critical scrutiny of our beliefs and\nassumptions should be a fundamental goal of education. What this means\nhas been variously interpreted (sometimes in ways that imply problem\nsolving, so called “lateral thinking”, and/or information\nliteracy), but a recurring theme is the importance of understanding\nargument and argument assessment. In 1980, a California State\nUniversity Executive Order required post secondary institutions in the\nstate include formal instruction in critical thinking in their\ncurriculum. According to the order: “Instruction in critical\nthinking is to be designed to achieve an understanding of the\nrelationship of language to logic, which should lead to the ability to\nanalyze, criticize, and advocate ideas, to reason inductively and\ndeductively and to reach factual or judgmental conclusions based on\nsound inferences drawn from unambiguous statements of knowledge or\nbelief” (Dumke 1980, Executive Order 338). \nThe idea that the analysis of ordinary arguing could best be furthered\nby creating an “informal logic” originated in the work of\nJohnson and Blair at the University of Windsor. Their textbook,\nLogical Self-Defense (1977), was an attempt to provide a\nsystematic approach to the study and teaching of informal argument.\nThe Informal Logic Newsletter they conceived and edited (now\nthe journal Informal Logic) successfully established informal\nlogic as a field for discussion, development and research. Forty years\nlater, the result is an established body of literature and a standard\n(but evolving) set of topics, problems, and issues. \nOther journals that have played a role in the rise of informal logic\ninclude Argumentation, Philosophy and Rhetoric,\nArgumentation and Advocacy (formerly the Journal of the\nAmerican Forensic Association), Teaching Philosophy,\nInquiry: Critical Thinking Across the Disciplines and, more\nrecently, Cogency and Argument and Computation. The\njournals ProtoSociology (1999) and Studies in Logic,\nGrammar, and Rhetoric (2009) have published special issues\ndevoted to topics in informal logic. \nSince its inception, the development of informal logic has been\nintertwined with pedagogical attempts to improve the ways in which\nstudents are taught to reason well. These attempts have given rise to\nhundreds (possibly thousands) of textbooks used to teach argumentation\nskills to university and college students in Canada, the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, and a growing number of other countries.\nThe available texts take many different approaches to the subject and\noffer many theoretical as well as pedagogical innovations. Currently\npopular texts include Govier 2014 (7th ed.); Groarke & Tindale\n2013 (5th ed.); Bowell and Kemp, 2010 (3rd ed.); Browne & Keeley\n2010 (10th ed.); Fisher 2011 (2nd ed.); Seay & Nuccetelli 2012\n(2nd ed.); Battersby 2016 (2nd ed.); Weston 2009 (4th edition); and\nHughes, Lavery & Doran 2014 (7th ed.). \nOutside of the English speaking world, the goals of informal logic\nhave been pursued in the Polish tradition of “pragmatic\nlogic”, which promotes the tools of logic as a component of\ngeneral education which can ensure that students think more clearly\nand consistently; express their thoughts and ideas systematically and\nprecisely; and justify their claims with proper inferences (see\nKoszowy 2010 and Ajdukiewicz, K. 1974). \nIncreasingly, the development of informal logic incorporates\napproaches to discourse and argumentation found in cognate disciplines\nand fields like Formal Logic, Speech Communication, Rhetoric,\nLinguistics, Artificial Intelligence, Semiotics, Cognitive Psychology,\nand Computational Modelling. Considered from this perspective,\ninformal logic is one component of a much broader multi-disciplinary\nattempt to develop an argumentation theory that can provide a\ncomprehensive account of real life reasoning.  \nIn the course of their development, both informal logic and\nargumentation theory have been nurtured and highlighted at a number of\ninternational conferences. They include eleven Windsor conferences\nhosted by the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA);\nseven Amsterdam conferences hosted at four-year intervals by the\nInternational Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA); five\nTokyo Conferences on Argumentation hosted by the Japanese Debate\nAssociation; seven COMMA conferences on computational models of\nargument; four Chilean conferences on Argumentation, Psychology of\nReasoning and Critical Thinking; and a Polish series of\n“ArgDiaP” workshops (dealing with argumentation, critical\nthinking, dialogue and persuasion). \nThe relationship between formal and informal logic is complex, and in\nsome ways controversial. As it is practiced today, informal logic is\nan offshoot of classical logic which shares a premise and conclusion\nconception of argument, many theoretical notions, and a similar\nconception of the elements of good argument. The relationship is too\ncomplex to be discussed in detail here, though some general comments\nmay help situate it and the controversies it sometimes gives rise to.\n \nHistorically, some key informal logicians have suggested it as a\ntheoretical alternative to formal logic. In his list of features that\ncharacterize informal logic, Johnson 1996 [2014] (p. 11) lists\n“dissatisfaction with formal logic as the vehicle for teaching skill\nin argument evaluation and argument formation” and “A desire to\nprovide a complete theory of reasoning that goes beyond formal\ndeductive and inductive logic.”  \nOne might take a different view. Informal logic is “informal” insofar\nas it studies arguments as they occur in natural language discourse\nrather than formal languages of the sort that characterize\npropositional logic, the predicate calculus, modal logic, etc.\n(languages which have rigorously specified syntax, semantics and\ngrammar, and clearly defined proof procedures). This is an important\npoint but it does not negate informal logic’s connections to formal\nlogic, especially as there is no consensus on the question how to best\npursue the study of such arguments and informal logicians sometimes\ndeploy formal methods of analysis (or mix formal and informal\nmethods).  \nCertainly there are aspects of everyday reasoning and argument which\ncan usefully be analyzed and studied using formal methods. Syllogistic\nlogic is one of the first formal approaches to argument and is,\nhistorically and today, frequently used to analyze everyday\nargumentation. Within informal logic, the general idea that logic\nshould focus on the logical form of an argument rather than its\nspecific content manifests itself in the common notion that informal\nlogic should assess ordinary arguments by treating them as instances\nof different argument schemes (schemes that include standard deductive\nforms of argument like modus ponens, modus tollens\nand disjunctive syllogism).  \nThe broader theoretical question posed by those who see formal and\ninformal logic as competing approaches to informal argument may be put\nas the question: “Does Informal Logic deal with the issues of the\nanalysis and assessment of informal argument better than Formal Logic\nby avoiding translation to artificial formal languages and the use of\nmathematics?” This is a question which raises complex issues which lie\nbeyond the scope of the present article, but it may help to say that\nthe proper answer to it varies depending on at least three variables:\none’s purpose in studying informal argument; the kinds of informal\narguments one considers; and the kinds of formal systems in question.\n \nThe purpose of informal logic is a broadly disseminated understanding\nof the difference between strong and weak argument which focuses on\nteaching and on argument in public discourse and interpersonal\ninteractions. Formal methods can play a role in this regard,\nespecially in cases in which they provide a more precise account of\nparticular kinds of argument (e.g., deductive arguments, arguments in\ndialogue, and probabilistic arguments). But even in these cases, the\nultimate aim of informal logic is ordinary language argument\ncharacterized by careful language and the principles of good\nreasoning.  \nThere are many informal arguments which are difficult to translate\ninto formal languages like those that characterize classical logic,\nbut the possibility of formally studying and analyzing such arguments\ngrows as formal logic develops formal frameworks that include\ndefeasible (non-monotonic) logic and probability theory (which is\nemerging as one theoretical approach to informal reasoning -- see\nZenker 2013). Some of the issues that this raises are evident in\ninformal logic’s interaction with AI and computational modeling, which\ndepend for their development on ways in which ordinary language\narguing can be understood within formal systems. Some now common\naspects of informal logic’s approach to argument (for example,\nargumentation schemes) have already influenced their attempts to\naccount for ordinary reasoning. \nThe broader interdisciplinary study of real life argument is often\ncalled “argumentation theory.” Above and beyond the study\nof arguments, it studies the broader contexts in which arguments are\nembedded and the conditions (institutional, psychological,\neducational, etc.) which give rise to disagreement, arguing and\nargument. In addition to informal logic, argumentation theory\nincorporates studies and insights from the fields of formal logic,\ncognitive psychology, rhetoric, dialectics, computational modeling,\nsemiotics, communication studies, Artificial Intelligence and other\nrelated disciplines. In the study of actual argument, these various\nfields frequently intersect and influence one another.  \nAlready in ancient times, the broader study of argument encompassed\nlogic, rhetoric, and dialectics. Each approached argument from a\nparticular point of view and gave rise to a distinct tradition within\nargumentation theory. Rhetoric continues to see arguing as a vehicle\nfor persuasion; dialectic understands arguing as an exchange between\ntwo or more arguers; and logic emphasizes the probative or epistemic\nmerit of an argument, making a good argument an argument which\njustifies the point of view that it proposes.  \nThough it emphasizes the epistemic merit of an argument, informal\nlogic has evolved in a way that incorporates elements of rhetoric\nand/or dialectics. The move in this direction has been motivated by\nthe same goal that motivates informal logic in the first place, i.e.\nthe desire to have an adequate theory of real life arguing. This\nrequires some account of the rhetorical and dialectical features of\nargument, for they can be key components of an argument’s success. \nIn real life arguing, most arguments function as a response to\ndisagreement. Arguers aim to justify the standpoint they defend in a\nway that convinces an intended audience or interlocutor. As rhetoric\nemphasizes, the former is more readily accomplished when one\nrecognizes and responds to the beliefs and attitudes of the audience\none addresses. As dialectics holds, successful arguments consider (as\nJohnson 2000 emphasizes) and respond to the likely objections to their\npoint of view. For this and other reasons, informal logic is a field\nof argumentation theory which borrows from, and intersects with,\nrhetoric, dialectics, and with many other argumentation disciplines\n(Bermejo Luque 2011 proposes a theory of argument that usefully\nillustrates the intersection of these various fields).  \nIn view of its pedagogical goals, informal logic has additional ties\nto educational movements which aim to make arguing and reasoning a\ncentral component (or the very cornerstone) of education. This has\nmade informal logic a key element of the Critical Thinking\nMovement, which promotes models of education which emphasize\nreasoning skills, critical self-reflection and the scrutiny of\nstudents’ assumptions, beliefs and decisions. \nOne might compare North American approaches to informal logic to\npragmatic logic as it has been developed in the Polish\nlogical tradition (Koszowy 2010), where it is one component of the\nPolish School of Argumentation. The latter brings together a multitude\nof formal and informal approaches to argument. It has outlined its\nresearch program in a Polish Manifesto (Budzynska et al. 2014). One\nmight easily describe informal logic as it has developed in North\nAmerica and pragmatic logic as it has developed in Poland as two\ndistinct (but in many ways, similar) attempts to create a satisfactory\ninformal logic. \nBlair 2015 divides the work of informal logic in two, comprising the\ninterpretive task of recognizing arguments (and\n“extracting” them from the discourse in which they are\nembedded), and the evaluative task of assessing them. Both tasks\nassume some account of what counts as argument. \nIn ordinary discourse, the word “argue” often means\n“to disagree” (usually it carries the implication that\nsomeone does so insistently or aggressively). In argumentation theory,\nargument in the sense of disagreement is often called\n“argument-2” (see Goodwin 2001). Like other logics,\ninformal logic focuses on arguing in a narrower sense, understanding\nan argument as an attempt to provide evidence in favour of some point\nof view. This can usefully be called an evidentiary account\nof argument. It makes arguing an intentional act (a speech or\ncommunication act) which is usually embedded in argument in the\nbroader sense, functioning as an attempt to resolve the disagreement\nthis implies. \nInformal logic understands arguments in the evidentiary sense as\ncollections of premises and conclusions. The premises provide the\nevidence that supports the conclusion. Hitchcock 2007 defines an\nargument as “a claim-reason complex” consisting of (1) an\nact of concluding, (2) one or more acts of premising (which assert\npropositions in favour of the conclusion), and (3) a stated or\nimplicit inference word that indicates that the conclusion follows\nfrom the premises. This makes arguments intentional acts that\nincorporate (1), (2) and (3).  \nA simple example that illustrates what this means in practice is the\nfollowing excerpt from an opinion article in the Western\nCourier (25/10/08), which criticized conservative groups\nunwilling to support any kind of embryonic research. \nWe may analyze this argument as the following claim-reason\ncomplex. \nThe following two examples are simple arguments that illustrate some\nof the issues that arise when we try to identify and extract arguments\nfrom their naturally occurring contexts. Both are (slightly amended)\nreports of arguments taken from a front page article in the New\nHampshire Rockingham News (30/8/2002) which discusses a court\ncase which sent the organizer of a series of dog fights to jail for\ncruelty to animals.  \nEXAMPLE 2: The attorney for the defendant asserted that the sentence\nhanded down by Judge Abrahamson did not fit the crime because it was\nunprecedented in length. \nEXAMPLE 3: A co-ordinator for the Humane Society supported a prison\nsentence, claiming that the minor penalties normally associated with\nmisdemeanour convictions are not a sufficient deterrent in this\ncase. \nIn the first case (EXAMPLE 2) we can summarize the reported argument\nas follows. \nHere the word “because” functions as an inference\nindicator, more precisely a premise indicator, which indicates\npremises in support of a conclusion. One sign of argument in ordinary\ndiscourse is an inference indicator (a word like “so,”\n“hence,” “therefore,” “because,”\n“thus,” etc.), but indicator words are used in other ways\nas well. Words like “because” may, for example, signal an\nexplanation rather than an argument, a causal connection, emphasis of\nsome sort, a temporal order, and so on. In the process of recognizing\nmany arguments, this means that a theory of argument needs to\ndistinguish the different uses of indicator words. \nIn other cases (as in EXAMPLE 1 and EXAMPLE 3) arguments are\ncommunicated without using inference indicators. In ordinary\ndiscourse, a list of statements may be understood as a series of\nclaims or as an attempt to justify one of the statements with the\nothers. The statements “Small businesses are major contributors\nto the economy. They account for over two-thirds of employment\nopportunities.” (EXAMPLE 4) are from a Chamber of Commerce\nstatement on small business. They can be understood as two of a series\nof claims that someone is making about small businesses or,\nalternatively, as a conclusion followed by a premise that supports it.\nIn deciding when we have an instance of argument, we must usually rely\non context to determine which interpretation is correct. \nStill other issues arise because important aspects of an argument may\nbe implicit or unclear in ordinary discourse. Statements may be\nconveyed by (rhetorical) questions like: “Can anyone seriously\nbelieve...?” “Are you joking?” “Could the\ndefendant have been in two places at once?” Often, the\ncomponents of an argument are interspersed with digressions and\nrepetitious remarks that are not relevant to it or its assessment. In\nthe process of extracting an argument from its context, this may mean\nthat we must recognize what is implicit but relevant to the argument\nat the same time that we discard what is explicit but redundant or\nirrelevant. \nIn examples 2 and 3, arguments depend on implicit claims which need to\nbe considered when assessing the arguments. In the process of\nidentifying the components of an argument, such claims are standardly\nidentified as “implicit” premises (or conclusions). In our\ntwo examples, this means that we can identify the components of the\narguments as: \nEXAMPLE 2:\nPremise: The sentence (handed down by Judge Abrahamson) was\nunprecedented in length.\nImplicit Premise: Sentences for crimes should not be of\nunprecedented length.\nInference Indicator: ...because...\nConclusion: The sentence handed down did not fit the\ncrime. \nEXAMPLE 3:\nPremise: The minor penalties normally associated with\nmisdemeanour convictions are not a sufficient deterrent in this case.\nImplicit Premise: Penalties for crimes should have a\ndeterrent effect.\nInference Indicator: (implicit: (...therefore...)\nConclusion: The prison sentence is appropriate. \nIt is important to recognize implicit premises and conclusions because\nthey are elements of argument that need to be analyzed and assessed in\nany attempt to evaluate the arguments that contain them. In EXAMPLE 3,\nfor example, the question whether punishments should be assigned by\nconsidering their deterrent effects is a key issue that needs to be\nconsidered in deciding whether the argument provides convincing\nevidence for its conclusion. In cases in which implicit premises or\nconclusions play a role in arguments, a comprehensive theory of\nargument must tell us how to choose between the competing alternatives\nthat might be proposed (by, e.g., postulating implicit premises with a\nbroader or narrower scope). \nHitchcock’s account of argument is purposely broad, in a way that\nhighlights an expansion of the notion of argument that has\ncharacterized the evolution of informal logic. Originally, paradigm\nexamples of argument were taken to be arguments which attempt to\nestablish some conclusion as plausibly true. As does the following\nargument for plate techtonics: “South America and Africa\nprobably began as a single continent, for the Eastern and Western\ncontours are remarkably symmetrical.” It can still be said that\narguments that provide evidence for the truth of their conclusions are\nan important subset of real life arguments, but the study of actual\narguing has underscored the point that arguments are used in many\nother ways. \nArguments are, for example, often used in situations of negotiation\n(in collective bargaining, e.g.), in which the aim of arguers is not\ntruth so much as agreement (and the promotion of their own interests).\nIn other cases arguing may be an attempt to establish consensus, to\ninstill fear or hope or some other emotional state, or to incite\npeople to behave in a certain way (to take up arms against a foe, or\nto support social change). Hoffman 2016 emphasizes the role that\nargument plays in stimulating reflection and raising questions about\none’s own reasoning. \nHitchcock’s account of argument accommodates most of these uses,\nsubsuming the possibility that premises and conclusions may be speech\nacts of different sorts. In particular, it allows a premise to be\nforwarded by any communication act which asserts a proposition\n(including, e.g., suggesting, hypothesizing, insulting and boasting);\nand allows a conclusion to be a request for information (“You\nwere there, so what was it like?”); a request to do something\n(“The children are shivering, so please close the door.”);\na commissive (“I know it matters to you, so I promise to go\ntomorrow.”), an expressive (“What we did was inexcusable,\nso we apologize.”) or a declarative (“The evidence shows\nthat you committed an assault, so I find you guilty as\ncharged.”). This broadening of the notion of argument is an\nessential way to recognize and distinguish the diverse roles that\nargument and inference actually play in real life contexts. \nIn a different way, the conception of argument informal logic assumes\nhas been broadened even further as informal logicians expand its scope\nto include the frequent instances of argument that utilize non-verbal\nelements. Kjeldsen 2015 provides a comprehensive overview of the study\nof visual arguments – arguments which employ non-verbal visuals\n(which may include photographs, film, art, cartoons, graphs, diagrams,\nand architecture). As Hitchcock notes, “a poster with a giant\nphotograph of a starving emaciated child and the words ‘make\npoverty history’ can reasonably be construed as an\nargument”. Drawings in a geometric proof, diagrams and\ndocumentary film provide many other examples of visual argument. One\nmight compare the expansion of informal logic to account for such\narguments to the attempt to expand formal logic to allow visual\ndeductions (see Barwise and Etchemendy 1998). \nConsidered from the point of view of the evidentiary account of\nargument, visual arguments are common, for visuals are often invoked\nin order to provide evidence for some conclusion (that someone is\nguilty of a crime, that a particular house is worth buying, or that a\nwork of art is a masterpiece). Consider the following two photographs,\ntaken by the NASA Mars rover Curiosity, which were heralded as the\nfirst proof that the planet Mars has water. Example 5 \nThe first photo shows the results of an initial dig by the rover, the\nsecond provides a view of the same dig four Mars days (sols) later.\nThe sequence shows white areas of the surface receding or (in the\nbottom left hand corner) entirely disappearing, an observation which\nwas taken to show that these surfaces are water in the form of ice\n(ice which begins to evaporate when the dig exposes it to the sun).\n \nLike most visual arguments, this example mixes visual and verbal cues\n(i.e. visuals and verbal claims). We might identify the key components\nof one elaboration of the argument (presented in a news exchange) as\nfollows. \nIn a case like this, the arguing is inherently visual because our\nlooking at the photographs is an essential element of the\nreasoning. It is this looking (combined with the attendant\nexplanation) which is supposed to convince us of the conclusion. \nThe use of visual images in arguments suggests that the traditional\nassumption that arguments are sets of sentences -- or the propositions\nthat sentences refer to -- is too limiting. More deeply, it raises the\nfundamental question whether arguments are best understood as\ncollections of propositions (the bearers of truth-value that\ndeclarative sentences refer to). One way to maintain this account is\nby understanding the images in visual arguments as another way to\nforward propositions or sets of propositions. However one understands\nvisual arguments, there is no easy way to reduce them to sets of\nsentences, for there is no exact way to translate what we see into\nwords (in part because it is difficult to choose between the many\ndifferent ways in which we can describe most visual images).  \nLike verbal arguments, visual arguments may take many different forms.\nA further example is the advertisement below (EXAMPLE 5). In this\ncase, the title “Just Add Vodka” is superimposed over a\nbottle of vodka spilling its contents onto a hamlet below. Outside the\nsplash of vodka, the time of day (dusk), the inactivity, and the\ndarkness suggest a sleepy hamlet where there is nothing to do at\nnight. This contrasts sharply with the bustling city scape that\nsprings life in the places where the vodka splashes to the ground\n— a cityscape that boasts a nightlife with skyscrapers and\nactivity: lights, people, nightclubs, bars, and restaurants. Example 6 \nIf we try to understand this image as a literal depiction of reality,\nit makes no sense: bottles of vodka are not so absurdly large, they do\nnot pour their contents on sleepy hamlets, and would not create\nManhattan streetscapes if they did. This tells us that the image is a\nvisual metaphor, another common way to use visuals in arguing. In this\ncase the metaphor is readily understood as one of transformation, the\nvodka being featured as a liquid catalyst for change. \nWe might summarize the argument as follows.  \nOne might add to this summary of the argument the implicit premise\nthat a life of cosmopolitan excitement is desirable, for this is a key\nclaim the argument assumes: and one that would need to be discussed in\nan assessment of the argument. As with many visuals, one could analyze\nthe meaning of the image in much greater detail by discussing the\nsemiotic aspects of visuals (one might, for example, discuss the\nimage’s apparent sexual innuendo). Once one recognizes the\nadvertisement (and many other advertisements) as an attempt to provide\na reason for buying something, we can analyze and assessed it using\nstandard techniques developed by informal logic.  \nInformal logicians have extended their account of argument to include\nvisual arguments for the same reason they have tried to extend logical\nmethods to the analysis of ordinary argument: because their goal is an\naccount of the kinds of arguing that play an important role in real\nlife arguing. Visual arguments are especially important at a time in\nwhich digital communication makes it so much easier to create and\ntransmit images. In the world of real life arguing, this is ushering\nin an era in which arguments increasing employ photographs, videos,\npolitical cartoons, 3D modeling and other visuals to prove matters in\ncourts, in social and political debate, in medical diagnosis, and so\non. \nStudies of visual argument are increasingly tied to discussions of\n“multimodal” arguing. Multimodality is a key notion in\nsocial semiotics, which suggests that there are many different modes\nof communication which can be used to make meaning. In argumentation\ntheory, multimodality has emerged as the idea that there are different\nmodes that can be employed in constructing arguments. Within informal\nlogic, Gilbert 1997 was the first to suggest that there are different\nmodes of arguing that need to be distinguished in a theoretical\nanalysis of argument (his modes are discussed below).  \nMaintaining informal logic’s standard focus on arguments in the\npremise and conclusion sense, Groarke 2015 expands the realm of\nargument to include, not only visuals, but tastes, smells, musical\nnotes and other non-verbal phenomenon. On this account, these\nnon-verbal entities may be key components of an argument (typically as\npremises). An argument constructed using a particular mode employs\nconstituents in that mode (which may be words, non-verbal sounds,\nvisuals, tastes, and so on). On battlefields, for example, doctors\nhave traditionally diagnosed infections using a mode of arguing that\ncan be described as “argument by smell.” In such cases,\nthe scent they smell functions as evidence (as an olfactory premise)\nfor the conclusion that the infection is (or is not) anaerobic. \nEXAMPLE 7 describes a different instance of multimodal argument which\nemploys arguing “by taste.” \nOne strand of this argument is a standard appeal to authority (the\nauthority of the wine guide) which is composed of words. The other is\nan argument by taste which uses taste to support the proposed\nconclusion -- that Frogs Leap PS 2015 is an exceptional Petite Syrah.\nWe can summarize this second strand of argument as: \nAn approach to informal argument that recognizes different modes of\narguing further expands the realm of argument, in a way that makes the\nanalysis of argument bear on a much broader range of reasoning. Modes\nare typically defined in a manner which highlights and draws attention\nto the different kinds of components which may be used in building\narguments. Some have suggested that it is important to distinguish\nbetween modes of spoken and written arguing because the sound of a\nspeakers voice is a key ingredient of the former which has no exact\nequivalent in the latter. Making this distinction is one way to\nrecognize the important role that an accent, a scream, a sobbing tone,\nor other prosodic elements may (as Kišiček forthcoming\nshows) play in argument. \nThe idea that there are different modes of arguing is one way to\naccount for new forms of argument that the development of\ncommunication technology makes possible. Virtual reality is, for\nexample, emerging as a powerful vehicle for political argument. One of\nthe first VR productions by the New York Times is\n“Kiya,” which recreates an incidence of domestic abuse in\norder to demonstrate the need to address the issue of domestic\nviolence. Its producer describes it as an attempt to use “the\nimmersive power of virtual reality: its ability to generate intense\nempathy on the part of the viewer; to wring from the audience the\nintense emotional connection that these stories deserve” (NYT,\nJan 21, 2016). In constructing arguments, this kind of emotional\nconnection can be a key element of the attempt to successfully\nconvince an audience of some conclusion. \nExtending the notion of argument so that it encompasses different\nmodes of arguing can be done without giving up the evidentiary notion\nof argument or the idea that evidence is presented in a set of\npremises that support some conclusion. One finds a more radical\napproach to the definition of argument in the work of Gilbert 1997,\n2014 (cf. Carozza 2007). According to his account, arguing occurs when\nclusters of attitudes, beliefs, feelings and intuitions produce\ndisagreement. An argument is an attempt to identify the points of\nagreement that characterize different arguers, in a way that brings\ntogether (the “coalescence” of) their different points of\nview. This approach expands the scope of argument to include whatever\ncan be used to bring about the coalescence that is the aim of\nargument. This allows the substance of argument to be, not only\nreasons in the traditional sense, but also emotional or physical or\nother means of coalescence.  \nGilbert develops his account by recognizing argument as it is\ntraditionally conceived as the “logical” mode of argument,\nand by adding to it “emotional,” intuitive\n(“kisceral”), and physical (“visceral”) modes\nof argument. According to this account, a hug, a forlorn look, or\ntears may count as argument. In real life situations, this underscores\nthe point that they may be a more effective method of resolving\ndisagreement than premises as they have been traditionally\nconceived. \nWhen we analyze real life arguments, our first task is the\nidentification of its component parts. Following Woods 1995b, doing so\nis sometimes called the “dressing” of an argument. This\ninvokes a comparison with the butcher’s craft, where one takes animals\n“on the hoof” and dresses them to produce meat for\nconsumption. In the case of arguments, arguments on the hoof are\narguments as they appear in their real life contexts. One dresses them\nto identify and isolate their key components in a way that prepares\nthe way for argument evaluation. Depending on the circumstances, and\nhow extensive an analysis one wants to carry out, the following are\nkey aspects of an argument that may need to be identified in the\nprocess of dressing it. \nThe most obvious task in dressing an argument is the identification of\nits premises and conclusion. Whether one analyzes an argument from a\nformal or an informal point of view, this is the starting point for\nargument evaluation. Like formal logic, informal logic understands\npremises and conclusions as the core components of an argument. In\nsimple cases, they are clearly and explicitly indicated and easily\nidentified. \nDressing arguments is a key aspect of the analysis of arguments that\noccur in ordinary discourse because such arguments are frequently\nunclear or open to interpretation. In isolating their premises and\nconclusions this means that we may have to:  \nThe analysis of examples in this article illustrates how this can be\ndone in a wide variety of cases.  \nThe possibility of implicit (sometimes called “hidden”)\npremises or conclusions is already recognized in ancient times, most\nnotably in the discussion of enthymemes. Some examples have already\nbeen noted. Another is the following argument, by then American\nVice-President Dick Cheney, defending the decision by the Bush\nadministration to try foreigners charged with terrorism offenses in\ntribunals located outside the United States -- locations not\nencumbered by protections of the accused guaranteed in American\ncourts.  \nWe can plausibly summarize this argument as:  \nHere the implicit premise identifies the link that ties the explicit\npremise to the conclusion. In dressing the argument it needs to be\nmade explicit because it needs to be assessed in any attempt to\nevaluate the argument. Recognizing it raises the question how a\n“lawful combatant” should be defined, especially as\ncombatants who illegally enter a country for the purpose of war (in\nundertaking surveillance or going behind enemy lines, for example) are\nwidely recognized as prisoners of war. \nThe task of identifying implicit premises or conclusions raises\ntheoretical questions because there are many circumstances in which\ndifferent implicit premises or conclusions can be attributed to an\nargument. One common principle used in such circumstances is the\n“Principle of Charity,” which directs us to look for an\nimplicit component premise that makes the argument as strong as\npossible. An alternative approach ascribes an argument the\n“logical minimum” -- i.e. the weakest premise necessary in\norder to connect the argument’s premises to its conclusion. \nA full account of the components of an argument must recognize aspects\nof their external as well as their internal components. In ordinary\ndiscourse, arguments often function as a way to convince a specific\naudience of some point of view, making audience a key feature of the\nargument. \nA successful argument for the conclusion that the United Nations\nshould be supported will, for example, need to address different\nissues when it is directed at a Chinese, Norwegian, or Swiss audience.\nAs successful arguers have always known (and as rhetoric emphasizes)\nsuccessful arguers address the beliefs, attitudes and values of their\nintended audience (they in this sense‘speak’ to it). In\nthe world of actual argument, this frequently means that true premises\nand a valid inference are not sufficient for successful argument. This\nis why Tindale (1999, 2004, 2010) and others advocate an approach to\ninformal logic that incorporates the analysis of audience.  \nThe simplest way to build audience into the analysis and assessment of\ninformal argument is in the way Aristotle suggests in his\nRhetoric. Taking his approach, we must evaluate an argument\nnot only by considering its logical strength (its logos, but\nalso the pathos of the audience to whom an argument is\naddressed, and the character (the ethos) of the arguer as it\nimpresses itself on the audience. The latter because, as Aristotle\nsays, an audience will be more easily convinced by someone who they\nperceive to be a good person. \nAnother external component of arguments is the kind of dialogue in\nwhich they are embedded. In a dialogue of inquiry, arguments are used\nas tools in an attempt to establish what is true. So understood,\narguments must adhere to strict standards that determine what counts\nas evidence and counter-evidence for some point of view. In\nnegotiation dialogue, arguments function in a different way. Here the\naim is an agreed settlement between two parties who have conflicting\ninterests and different, possibly irreconcilable, points of view. One\ncan summarize these differences by saying that the expectations, norms\nand procedures for arguing depend on the kind of dialogue in which an\nargument is proposed. \nWalton 2007 understands a dialogue as an exchange made up of an\nopening stage, an argumentation stage, and a closing stage. In the\nopening stage, the arguers in the dialogue agree to participate. The\nrules for the dialogue define what types of moves are allowed, what\nkinds of questions and responses are permitted, and what norms must be\nadhered to. The seven basic types of dialogue he distinguishes can be\nsummarized as follows. \nWithin these general categories, more specific kinds of dialogue may\nbe governed by strict rules. One subspecies of negotiation dialogue\nis, for example, collective bargaining, which legally prohibits\n“bargaining in bad faith” -- i.e. bargaining which takes\nplace outside the bargaining table. In this kind of negotiation, the\nuse of threats (to strike or lock employees out) are a key part of the\nprocess. In sharp contrast, threats are not acceptable in critical\ninquiry, where they are classed as instances of the fallacy ad\nbacculum. \nThe question whether there are other kinds of dialogue which need to\nbe recognized remains open, as does the question whether there are\ntypes of argumentation which cannot be categorized in terms of any of\nthe standard forms of dialogue (because they are a hybrid of different\nkinds of dialogue, or some new form of dialogue which is not clearly\ndefined). Recognizing a dialogue in which an argument is embedded is\nan important part of dressing when this imposes standards for\nargumentative exchange which arguers may not have properly adhered\nto. \nDialectics highlights the extent to which argumentation is an exchange\nbetween (real or imagined) interlocutors who argue for opposing points\nof view. It positions argument within the broader scope of dispute and\ndebate. In argumentation theory, this approach to argument has been\nhighlighted in pragma-dialectics, a theory which originates in Van\nEemeren and Grootendorst 1992. It has been elaborated by “the\nAmsterdam School”, which has extended the different aspects of\ntheir theoretical perspective (see Feteris et al. 2011). It\nunderstands argumentation as a means of resolving differences of\nopinion according to the rules of critical discussion (a particular\nkind of dialogue that aims at the rational resolution of differences\nof opinion). \nWithin informal logic, the dialectical aspects of argument are\nmanifest in the notion that arguers have “dialectical\nobligations” which are an essential component of proper argument\n(see Johnson 2000). As arguers, this suggests that our fundamental\ndialectical obligation is an obligation to respond to (and, where\npossible, anticipate) alternative points of view. In particular, we\nmust respond to objections to our own views that are likely to be\nraised by our opponents in the dispute in which we are engaged.  \nTo emphasize this point, Johnson distinguishes between the\n“illative” core of an argument and its\n“dialectical” tier. The illative core is the set of\npremises offered in support of the conclusion; the dialectical tier\nconsists of alternative points of view, likely objections to the\nconclusion, and the premises and whatever assumptions characterize\ndebate about the conclusion. According to Johnson, all genuine\narguments are dialectical and all arguers are obligated to discharge\ndialectical obligations. This suggests that the standard account of\nargument assumed in the history of logic — a giving of reasons\nfor some conclusion — can, without such elaboration, be\nclassified only as a “proto-argument.” \nWhether or not one goes as far as Johnson, one of the external\ncomponents of argument that needs to be taken into account in dressing\nmany real life arguments is the extent to which it is dialectical and\nthe objections of interlocutors (real or potential) who have different\npoints of view. This is another aspect of argument which may need to\nbe noted in preparing it for assessment. \nDressing arguments is a precursor to argument evaluation. It aims to\nidentify and isolate their premises and conclusions, the inferences\nthey contain, and other components which may be relevant to their\nassessment. Dressing can be a complex endeavour which requires the\ndiscarding of irrelevant aspects of communication, an interpretation\nof a situation in which premises and conclusions are not clearly\ndemarcated, the identification of implicit premises or conclusions;\nand/or a recognition of multimodal premises or conclusions. In many\ncases, it requires a recognition that it is embedded in a particular\nkind of dialogue, is part of an exchange with some identifiable\nargumentative opponent, or is addressed to a specific audience an\narguer is trying to convince. In this way, a full dressing of an\nargument requires a detailed account of its internal and external\nfeatures. \nAs Blair 2015 has emphasized, the ultimate goal of informal logic is\nnormative. Its aim is an account of argument that can be used to\ndecide when arguments are strong and weak; good and bad; and plausible\nand implausible. Informal logicians dress arguments to prepare them\nfor evaluation. In view of this much of informal logic is an attempt\nto develop standards, criteria and processes for judging arguments.\nParticular arguments may be assessed in terms of general criteria for\ngood argument; or as an instance of a fallacy or a particular scheme\nof argument.  \nOne way to assess arguments in ordinary discourse is by translating\nthem into a formal language and assessing them accordingly. This is a\nmethod which informal logicians sometimes use, especially in\ndiscussions of artificial intelligence, game theoretic approaches to\ndialogue, and formal accounts of various kinds of reasoning. More\ninformal methods have been emphasized in the teaching of arguments and\nreasoning. in the use of informal logic in public discourse (to argue\nfor or against, or in the analysis of particular points of view) and\nin the study of arguments which are not easily accommodated by formal\nmethods.  \nIn classical logic, an argument is (deductively) valid if its\nconclusion follows from its premises -- if it is impossible for its\npremises to be true and its conclusion false. The ultimate aim of\narguing is a “sound” argument: a valid argument with true\npremises. Many issues arise if one tries to apply these criteria to\ninformal arguments without adapting them in a number of ways, but they\nusefully make the point that the strength of an argument is a function\nof two things: (i) the viability of its premises, and (ii) the\nstrength of the inference from these premises to its conclusion.  \nWithin informal logic the simplest criteria for judging arguments is\nan informal analogue of soundness. It requires that an argument’s\npremises be acceptable and that its conclusion follow from these\npremises. We may call the latter “informal” validity\n(leaving open the question how it is best understood) and these two\ncriteria the “AV” (Acceptability, Validity) criteria for\nassessing arguments.  \nFollowing Johnson & Blair (1977, 1994) many informal logicians\nunderstand informal validity in terms of relevance and sufficiency,\nmaking the criteria for good argument acceptability, relevance and\nsufficiency (the “ARS” criteria). The premises of an\nargument count as relevant to its conclusion when they provide some\nsupport for the conclusion and sufficient when they provide enough\nsupport to establish it as plausible. Relevance can be contrasted with\nirrelevance, which occurs in various instances of non\nsequitur, as occurs in the case of “straw man” and\n“red herring” arguments, which are common in ordinary\ndiscourse. \nIn contrast with classical logic, both the AV and ARS criteria assess\npremises as acceptable or unacceptable rather than true or false.\nInformal logic evaluates premises in this way for many reasons. As\nPinto 2001 points out, the aim of many arguments does not appear to be\nassent to the truth of a proposition but the withholding of assent (or\nfull assent) or a particular attitude or emotional state. An argument\nmay, for example, function as a means of instilling fear or hope or\ndisapprobation. In order to leave room for these kinds of examples, he\ndefines an argument as “an invitation to inference”\n(68–69) which need not have as its aim justifying the truth of\nsome proposition. \nInformal logic favors acceptability over truth as a criteria for\njudging premises for other reasons as well. Because real life arguing\ntends to take place in contexts characterized by uncertainty which\nmake it difficult to make judgments of truth or falsity. Because such\narguments frequently revolve around ethical and aesthetic judgments\nwhich are not easily categorized as true or false. Because there are\ncontexts (e.g., bargaining) in which good arguments do not depend on\npremises that can clearly be categorized as true or false. Because\nthere are other contexts (in dealing with specific audiences, e.g.) in\nwhich truth may not, in itself, make a premise acceptable for informal\nargument. And, more generally, because philosophical discussions of\ntruth which have raised many questions about what counts as true and\nfalse. \nUnderstanding argument strength in terms of truth is also problematic\nin case of multimodal arguments which employ images and other\nnon-verbal kinds of evidence. In these kinds of cases, it is not\ndifficult to understand multimodal elements (photographs, diagrams,\netc.) as misleading or not (and hence acceptable or unacceptable)\nthough they are not naturally described as true or false.  \nWithin argument evaluation, one of the key questions raised by\ninformal logic is the question how we should understand the informal\nvalidity which is a key component of strong arguments. Though informal\nlogicians commonly distinguish between deductive and various\nalternative kinds of validity, some have (as Govier 1987 points out)\nassumed an alternative view, which she calls “Natural Language\nDeductivism” (NLD). It maintains that all informal arguments can\nbest be interpreted as attempts to create deductively valid\ninferences, and should be analyzed and assessed accordingly. \nTo understand how NLD operates, we must see past the traditional use\nof deductive proof in logical and mathematical reasoning, which has\nencouraged the common misconception that deductive arguments are\narguments with certain or necessary conclusions (like those\ntraditionally associated with logical and mathematical reasoning). In\ngeneral, a deductive conclusion is as certain as the premises it is\nfounded on. This is an important point in informal contexts, where\narguments rely on premises which are reasonable or plausible rather\nthan certain. In such contexts, deductive arguments yield conclusions\nwhich are not certain, but reasonable or plausible.  \nThe following example is taken from a radio commentary on population\ngrowth.  \nThis is an obviously deductive argument but one which depends on a\npremise which is not certain, but reasonable (because it is backed by\nother reasoning that extrapolates from established population trends).\nThe argument is deductively valid, but it follows that its conclusion\nis reasonable rather than certain. \nIn dealing with arguments which are not explicitly deductive, the NLD\napproach interprets an argument as a deductive argument by attributing\nit implicit premises that make it so. The following argument is a\nfrequently criticized pattern of popular reasoning which appeals to\nthe authority of the television personality Dr. Oz, who provides\nnutritional and lifestyle advice. \nIf one judges only by the explicit premise (“Dr. Oz Says\nIt”) this is not a deductively valid argument for the premise\ncould be true and the conclusion false (Dr. Oz could be wrong). NLD\ncircumvents this issue by ascribing the argument an implicit premise\nwhich renders it deductive. So understood the argument can be\nsummarized as:  \nThis is a plausible reconstruction of the argument. For we cannot draw\nthe conclusion from the stated premise without accepting the implicit\npremise. Once it is explicit, the argument is clearly deductive.  This\ndoes not make it a good argument and instead suggests that we must\nevaluate its strength, not by evaluating its validity, but by\nevaluating the plausibility of its premises. Because the implicit\npremise is implausible -- as could be shown by citing many examples\nwhere Dr. Oz’s advice can be shown to be questionable -- an NLD\nanalysis entails the (correct) conclusion that the argument is\nweak. \nBecause NLD reconstructs informal arguments as deductively valid\narguments, Govier describes it as a theory of\n“reconstructive” deductivism. It makes argument assessment\na two step process which (i) reconstructs an argument (by adding\nimplicit premises) to make it a clearly deductive inference, and (ii)\nthen evaluates the argument by assessing the strength of its (explicit\nand implicit) premises. The pragma-dialectical account of indirect\nspeech acts (Eemeren and Grootendorst 2002, Groarke 1999) is well\nsuited to the first of these two tasks. Deductive reconstruction\nalways seems possible because one can always assign the claim that an\nargument’s conclusion follows from its explicit premises as an\nimplicit premise that renders the inference deductively valid. \nThe following inductive generalization can serve to show how NLD deals\nwith what would otherwise be thought to be paradigm examples of\ninformal arguments which are not deductively valid. \nTaking an NLD approach, this argument can be understood as a\ndeductively valid argument which can be dressed as: \nWhen the argument is analyzed in this way, its strength can be\nevaluated by assessing the strength of its explicit and implicit\npremise. This is a productive approach to evaluation because the\nfundamental issue the argument raises is whether the French the arguer\nhas met are a representative sample of the French in general (rather\nthan, say, those in their own profession), i.e. the question raised\nwhen one assesses the proposed implicit premise. \nDeductivist reconstruction is an approach to argument assessment which\nmakes explicit some of the key claims and assumptions that individual\narguments depend on. Because it analyzes all arguments as instances of\none well understood form of inference it eliminates the need to\ndistinguish between arguments which are deductive, inductive,\nconductive, abductive, etc. -- a distinction which can be difficult to\nmake in dealing with informal arguments which can be interpreted in\ndifferent ways. Aristotle is a key figure who adopts a deductivist\napproach (see Groarke 2009). \nThose who reject deductivism argue that it is an artificial theory\nwhich forces informal arguments to adhere to an overly restrictive\nmodel of inference that is too narrow to account for the richness of\nordinary reasoning (see Johnson 2000 and Godden 2004). \nOther approaches to informal logic understand informal validity in a\nvariety of ways. They see deductive reasoning as one variant of such\nvalidity, but distinguish other ways in which premises may entail\nconclusions. In doing so, they assess the strength of an argument by\nassessing the acceptability of its premises and the strength of the\nlink between its premises and its conclusion. The ARS criteria provide\none basic way to distinguish between arguments that provide no, some\nand strong support for their conclusions. \nMany treatments of informal arguments assume the distinction between\ndeductive and inductive arguments, a distinction which Govier 1987\ndubs “the great divide,” emphasizing the latter over the\nformer. Sometimes inductive arguments are understood narrowly, as\ninductive generalizations, but they are more commonly said to be\narguments in which the premises of the argument are only probable or\nplausible, leaving open the possibility that the premises are\nfalse. \nIn their categorization of basic forms of inference, informal logic\nalso countenances other forms of validity: notably\n“conductive” and “abductive” arguments.\nConductive arguments accumulate non-decisive reasons in favour of a\nconclusion. Different pieces of evidence may merely suggest (and not\nprove) that someone charged with murder is guilty. But accumulated\n(the witness said he pulled the trigger, the ballistics report shows\nthat the bullet came from a gun he owned, he was overheard saying he\nwould “get” the victim, etc.) these different reasons may\nprovide a strong, though not conclusive, conductive argument for the\nconclusion that the accused is guilty. \nAbductive arguments are inferences to the best explanation. They\ntypically recognize some facts, point out that they are entailed by\nsome hypothesis, and conclude that the hypothesis is true. Taken at\nface value, abductive arguments appear to be instances of the\ndeductive fallacy “affirming the consequent,” and might on\nthese grounds be dismissed, but it is clear that they play a central\nrole in medical, scientific and legal reasoning (see Walton 2004). \nIn its search for more nuanced ways to deal with informal logic,\ninformal logic initially turned to fallacy theory. In its treatment of\nthe fallacies, it revives a tradition which can be traced to\nAristotle. In the history of logic and philosophy, its significance is\nreflected in the writings of Locke, Whately, and Mill. Today, this\ntradition manifests itself in textbooks and websites which attempt to\nteach good informal reasoning by teaching students how to detect the\nstandard fallacies. One can find a detailed discussion in the article\non\n fallacies\n in this encyclopedia. \nTheoretical discussions of fallacies have not produced an agreed-upon\ntaxonomy, but there is a common set of fallacies which are frequently\nused in the analysis of informal arguments. They include formal\nfallacies like affirming the consequent and denying the antecedent;\nand informal fallacies like ad hominem (“against the\nperson”), slippery slope, ad bacculum (“appeal to\nforce”), ad misericordiam (“appeal to\npity”), “hasty generalization,” and “two\nwrongs” (as in “two wrongs don’t make a right”). In\ninformal logic textbooks, authors may devise their own nomenclature to\nhighlight the properties of particular instances of fallacious\nargument (“misleading vividness” designates the misuse of\nvivid anecdotal evidence, and so on.) \nIn the research literature, Woods and Walton have discussed the\ndefinition, analysis and assessment of a variety of fallacies in a\nseries of articles and books, first as co-authors and then\nindividually (see Woods and Walton 1989, Walton 1989, Woods 1995,\nWalton 2000). Van Eemeren and Grootendorst 1992 have proposed a\n“pragma-dialectical” theory which analyses fallacies as\nviolations of the rules of critical discussion dialogues. A\nrepresentative collection of classical and contemporary essays on the\nfallacies is found in Hansen and Pinto 1995. \nFallacy theory has been criticized on the grounds that there is no\nagreed way to define what a fallacy is; because there is considerable\ndisagreement over the definition of particular fallacies; and because\none may evaluate most arguments without having to rely on an account\nof fallacies (see, e.g., Feldman 2009). Approaches to ordinary\nargument that do focus on fallacies emphasize examples of poor\nreasoning rather than good argument. Hitchcock (1995, 324), e.g.,\nwrites that the idea that we should teach reasoning by fallacies is\n“like saying that the best way to teach somebody to play tennis\nwithout making the common mistakes … is to demonstrate these\nfaults in action and get him to label and respond to them.” \nThe issues with fallacy theory are compounded by many instances of\ntraditional fallacies which seem to have some merit real life\nargument. The following are examples: \nEXAMPLE 12:\n\nA remark from a Danish television debate over the question whether the\nDanish church should be separated from the Danish state (Jorgensen\n1995, 369): “You should not listen to my opponent. He wants to\nsever the Danish church from the state for his own personal\nsake.” This appears to be a classic example of ad\nhominem, Kahane 1995 (p. 65), describing it as a fallacy that\noccurs when an arguer attacks “his opponent rather than his\nopponent’s evidence and arguments.” In this case the issue\nraised is the speaker’s motivation for his position rather than the\nposition itself. But if there is good reason to believe that he wants\nto sever the church from the state for his own personal gain, this may\nbe a legitimate reason not to take his arguments seriously (because he\nhas a conflict of interest). \nEXAMPLE 13:\n\nMartin Luther King Jr., influenced by Gandhi, argued that we can\njustifiably break laws if our goal is just change. Such arguments play\na central role in the civil rights movement. They are not obviously\nfallacious, but they seem to be a clear case of “two wrongs make\na right” suggesting that we can justifiably do something wrong\n(break a law) because it is a response to another wrong. \nEXAMPLE 14:\n\nThe argument that “the attempt to use military might to put an\nend to terrorism is wrong because it will take us down a slippery\nslope that will end in improper interference in the affairs of\nindependent states” cannot be dismissed by saying that it is an\ninstance of the fallacy slippery slope. If the slippery slope is\nplausible, then the argument has some merit. \nEXAMPLE 15:\n\nThe argument “No one with a history of heart disease should take\nup running, for running is a strenuous form of exercise, and no one\nwith a history of heart disease should engage in strenuous\nexercise” is deductively valid. One cannot accept the premises\nwithout accepting the conclusion. But this suggests that all deductive\narguments commit the fallacy begging the question, which occurs when\nan argument assumes what it attempts to prove. \nIn the wake of many examples and discussions of this sort, careful\naccounts of fallacies increasingly recognize that there can be\nreasonable arguments which have the form of traditional fallacies. \nOne way to deal with the issues such examples raise is by\ndistinguishing fallacies which do and do not have non-fallacious\ninstances. Equivocation, post hoc ergo propter hoc, false\ndilemma, non sequitor and hasty generalization are, for\nexample, patterns of argument that are inherently mistaken. In\ncontrast, fallacies like ad hominem, two wrongs reasoning,\nguilt by association, and appeal to pity are fallacies which appear to\nhave legitimate uses in real life reasoning.  \nIf one analyzes ad hominem as a particular kind of move in\ndialectical exchange, for example, then one may recognize rules of\ndialogue which distinguish circumstances in which such moves are and\nare not acceptable.  \nThough some of the issues with the traditional fallacies have\ndiminished their significance in the theory of argument, they continue\nto be a popular way to analyze everyday reasoning and argument,\nintroductions to fallacies sometimes listing hundreds of variants\n(Dowden 2016 (Other Internet Resources), Bennett 2013, Paul and Elder\n2012). Battersby and Bailin 2011 have suggested that fallacies be\nunderstood as argument patterns “whose persuasive (rhetorical)\npower greatly exceeds its probative value (i.e., evidential\nworth),” making fallacies errors in reasoning that are rooted in\ntheir rhetorical appeal.  \nArgument schemes are recurring patterns of argument. Once identified\nthey can be used to evaluate an instance of arguing, or as recipes\nwhich tell us how to construct strong arguments. Walton, Reed &\nMacagno 2008 provide a significant compendium of 96 schemes. Within\ninformal argument, commonly used schemes include Argument by Sign,\nArgument by Analogy, Argument by Example, and Slippery Slope\nArgument. \nOne standard approach to argument schemes combines a particular\npattern of argument with a set of “critical questions”\nthat it raises. Consider the scheme “Appeal to Authority”\n(also called “Appeal to Expert Opinion”), which might be\nsummarized as follows.  \nThe following student comment is an example of an argument from\nauthority. \nWe can summarize this as an instance of the argument from authority\nscheme, where A=Einstein, D=politics (of nuclear weapons), T=The\nproliferation of nuclear weapons will lead to terrible destruction. We\ncan then assess the argument by asking whether there are satisfactory\nanswers to the critical questions the argument raises. In this case,\nquestions of particular importance are question 2 (“Is Einstein\nan authority on the politics of nuclear weapons?”) and question\n5 (“Is the claim that the proliferation of nuclear weapons will\nlead to terrible destruction with what other experts on the politics\nof nuclear weapons assert?”). Because it is not clear that\neither question has a positive answer, example 16 is a weak\nargument. \nOne way to understand schemes is as moves in argument which are backed\nby the warrants implied by the critical questions that accompany them.\nAlternatively, one may understand a scheme as a kind of inference rule\n(see Prakken 2010b), some critical questions ensuring the truth of the\npremises, others ensuring that the context of the inference is\nappropriate. Deductive schemes are commonly codified in standard rules\nof inference like modus ponens (“Affirming the\nAntecedent”), double negation, modus tollens, etc. \nGroarke & Tindale 2013 use traditional fallacies as a basis for a\nset of schemes, treating ad hominem, guilt by association,\nappeals to ignorance, two wrongs reasoning, etc. not as fallacies, but\nas legitimate patterns of reasoning. If an arguer has, for example,\nrepeatedly shown poor judgment, bias or clearly lacks the requisite\nknowledge to make reasonable judgments about some issue, then this is\na plausible reason to dismiss their point of view on ad\nhominem grounds. This is especially true in informal contexts, in\nwhich arguers frequently do not have the time or ability to\ninvestigate and assess all the arguments behind the various positions\ndirected at them. On this account of schemes, fallacies turn out to be\ndeviations from an inherently correct norm.  \nMuch remains to be said about the assessment of multimodal arguments\nthat include non-verbal elements. That said, the different techniques\ninformal logic uses to assess informal arguments can in many cases be\napplied to visual and other multimodal arguments. Even when the\npremises of an argument are not verbal, one can judge them as\nacceptable or not. A photograph or an image presented as evidence for\na conclusion may be unacceptable because it presents a situation in a\nmisleading way -- because it cuts out essential context, because it\nhas been tampered with, and so on. In advertising, many photographs\nare purposely ‘doctored’ to present things in ways that do not\naccurately reflect what is photographed. \nIn evaluating multimodal argument, the AV and RSA criteria for good\nargument can be applied. In an election campaign, a political cartoon\nwhich depicts a politician as a liar may invite the inference that\nvoters should not vote for him/her. In assessing the argument\npresented, we may ask whether this portrayal fairly or unfairly\ncharacterizes the politician in question, and whether the suggested\nconclusion that one should not vote for them follows (possibly not if\nother candidates have more serious shortcomings). \nIn many instances, multimodal arguments are instances of fallacies of\nparticular argument schemes. Visuals used in argumentation are, for\nexample, often instances of “hasty generalization,” using\nemotionally powerful pictures of some behavior to promote\ngeneralizations which are not founded on a proper, representative\nsample. Dove 2016 has discussed the application of argument schemes to\ncases of visual argument, showing how this is easily accomplished. He\nsuggests one scheme, “argument from fit” as a uniquely\nvisual scheme that applies to arguments in which the borders of two\nobjects are visually inspected to determine whether the objects are\npart of a larger whole (as when one tries to piece together fragments\none might find in an archaeological dig). \nLike any field of study, informal logic is constantly evolving. Its\nattempt to understand argument as it occurs in a broad range of real\nlife situations continues to push it toward a broader account of\nargument which recognizes more ways in which arguing can occur and how\nand when it should be judged successful. The following are some\ncurrent topics of discussion. \nWhen one understands an argument as a collection of premises and a\nconclusion with an inference structure one may illuminate and analyze\nthis structure with argument diagrams or “maps.” Mapping\nof this sort has a long history. It is already used in Whatley 1826\nand in the early twentieth century, by Wigmore 1913, who develops a\nform of mapping (“evidence charts”) to portray and analyze\ncomplex chains of judicial reasoning. \nAs interest in the analysis of informal reasoning has intensified, it\nhas been accompanied by a renewed interest in argument mapping. In\nsome ways this has revived the practice of mapping, but in a new way\nthat allows for much more complex and sophisticated approaches to\nmapping. Most significantly, it has been accompanied by the\ndevelopment of software (Rationale, Reason!Able, Araucaria, Athena,\nCompendium, Theseus) and online aids (Debate Mapper, TruthMapping.Com,\nArgunet, Agora) designed to assist in the mapping of real life\narguing.  \nOne of the catalysts for the development of informal logic has been\nthe desire to extend theories of argument so that they can account for\naspects of arguing which are not accounted for in traditional accounts\nof argument. The study of the argumentative use of visuals\n(photographs, video, drawings, etc.) is a case in point. A more recent\ntopic is the study of the role of narratives in arguing. This is a\nrole that is already highlighted in ancient times -- most famously in\nPlato. His version of “The Ring of Gyges” is, for example,\na story used to support a particular conception of human nature. In\nthe case of fables, parables, and morality plays, narratives seem to\nbe explicitly designed to be effectively used in argument.  \nOne can understand the narratives used in argument in different ways:\nas embellishments, analogies, or as veiled generalizations. Current\ndiscussions are influenced by Fisher 1987, who argues that argument\nitself is best understood as narrative, and by Nussbaum 1990, who\nlooks to literature as a way to better understand complex moral\nsituations. The significance of narratives in arguments is recognized\nin argument schemes that Walton, Reed, & Macagno 2008 identify as\n“narrative-based” schemes. \nBut the extent and usefulness of analyses of narratives as argument\nremains a matter of debate (see Govier & Ayer 2013, Olmos 2014,\nPlumer 2015). Certainly it is clear that stories, including fictional\nstories, can play a key role in establishing conclusions, but this\nleaves open the questions whether they should be understood as\npremises and/or conclusions, and whether they are in some way\nirreducibly narrative (and need to be analyzed and evaluated with\nalternative standards for good argument). \nIt seems obvious that an argument cannot succeed without being\nrecognized and paid attention to. The best argument in the world\ncannot convince someone of its conclusion if everyone ignores it. In\nthe world of public argument, this is a serious issue, for the public\nhas a great many arguers and arguments competing for its attention. In\na world in which a quick search for information produces thousands of\ncompeting arguments on virtually any topic, it is constantly\noverwhelmed by many more arguments and points of view than anyone can\nconsider seriously. \nArgument “flags” operate as one solution to this problem,\nfunctioning as a way to draw attention to an argument. A successful\nflag may be a stunning photograph of a tragedy, a provocative act (of\nthe sort that draws attention to Greenpeace campaigns), a large\nnewspaper headline, or a question that peaks an audience’s curiosity.\nMany flags are not a part of the premise and conclusion structure of\nan argument, only serving to draw attention to it. In cases such as\nthese, a flag does not add to the epistemic merit of an argument, but\nit may still play a key role achieving argument success by ensuring\nthat an argument is taken seriously. \nTraditionally, emotional appeals have been seen as fallacious moves in\nargument. This is too simple a view of the role of emotion within\ninformal discourse, where appeals to emotion play a significant role\nthat cannot be rejected out of hand. In a discussion of nuclear\npolicy, the emotion inherent in a description of the consequences of\nnuclear war (say, the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima) can play a\nlegitimate role in argument. In legal proceedings, there is explicit\nroom for a victim’s emotional account of the impact of a crime, which\nis usually considered in sentencing. \nGilbert 1997,2014 has emphasized emotional arguments, investigating\nthe role that different kinds of emotion and expressions of emotion\nplay in real life arguments, where they often function as a way to\nconvince an audience of a particular point of view. When a student (to\ntake one of Gilbert’s examples) cries in a professor’s office as they\nplead for a higher mark, their emotional outpouring is a key component\nof their attempt to convince the professor that their mark should be\nchanged. In real interchange, such appeals are frequently successful.\nIn distinguishing between appeals which should be accepted and\nrejected, Gilbert suggests a re-conception of argument that recognizes\nemotional arguments as a unique genre of argument that needs to be\nevaluated in a different way than traditional approaches to argument\nsuggest. \nCritical thinking tests attempt to measure argumentation skills. They\nhave been used to test the abilities of students or others, but also\nas a way to test the success of attempts to teach informal reasoning.\nThough they can provide an important way to empirically measure the\nskills that informal logic teaches, many of the tests are inconclusive\nand beset by many problems. \nWhat should count as good reasoning and critical thinking (or, even\nmore so, creative thinking) is not easily assessed using standardized\ntests designed for large scale use, which typically rely on multiple\nchoice question and answers (see Sobocan et al. 2007). The California\nCritical Thinking Test reflects the (outdated) view of critical\nthinking elaborated in “The Delphi Report,” commissioned\nby the American Philosophical Association in 1987. It focuses on a\nvery narrow range of critical thinking skills (one of many\npossibilities) which in many ways oversimplifies the competencies\nrequired for good informal reasoning (see Groarke 2007).  \nIn real life contexts, good arguing (and thinking) is in many ways\nopen ended and unpredictable, dialectical, and influenced by pragmatic\nand contextual considerations which are difficult to incorporate\nwithin standard tests. Ennis 2013 provides a comprehensive proposal\nfor dealing with this and the other complex issues that are raised by\nattempts to teach critical thinking.  \nThe assumptions of informal logic have been tested in a different way\nby commentators who study argument “corpora” -- large\ncollections of argument drawn from natural language discourse. In an\nearly study of this sort, Jorgenson, Kock and Rorbech 1991 analyzed a\nseries of 37 one-hour televised debates from Danish public TV. The\ndebates featured well-known public figures arguing for and against\ncurrent policy proposal. A representative audience of 100 voters voted\nbefore and after the debate, in an attempt to statistically establish\nwhat moves and properties are likely to win votes in a representative\naudience. These conclusions were then compared with commonly held\nnotions about “proper” or “valid”\nargumentation. Other studies consider corpora made up of large\ndatabases of selected written texts (see, e.g., Goodwin & Cortes\n2010, and Mochales & Ieven 2009). In principle, corpora made up of\nwhole libraries may be tested. \nArgument mining has emerged as a subfield of data mining, or text\nmining (or computational linguistics). It uses software and algorithms\nthat automatically process text looking for argument structures -- for\npremises, conclusions, argumentation schemes, and extended networks of\nargument. Researchers have investigated methods for argument mining in\nlegal documents , on-line debates, product reviews, academic\nliterature, user comments on proposed regulations, newspaper articles\nand court cases, as well as dialogical domains.\n Arg-tech,\n the Centre for Argument Technology, plays a central role in such\ndevelopments. \nVirtue-based approaches to informal argument extend virtue-based\napproaches to ethics and epistemology to the realm of informal\nargument. Doing so shifts attention from a focus on acts or objects of\narguing toward the agents who create them. Looking at arguments from a\nvirtue point of view, one might say that the wise person (the person\nwho embodies virtues) is the best judge and provides the ultimate\ncriterion for whether something is a good or bad argument or should be\nbelieved. This makes the epistemological criterion the lived reality\nof someone judicious rather than a fixed formula or algorithm. A list\nof works on virtue approaches to argument is available at\n Virtues and Arguments: A Bibliography. \nLike informal logic, the development of artificial intelligence\nrequires theoretical models that can account for informal arguing in\nwidely diverse contexts. Informal logic models of argument have,\ntherefore, influenced the attempt to model argumentation between\nagents in multi-agent systems which mimic or assist human reasoning.\nComputational applications have been applied to large-scale webs of\ninter-connected arguments, and to reasoning about medical decisions,\nlegal issues, chemical properties and other complex systems. Automated\nargument assistance functions as a computational aid that can assist\nin the construction of an argument. Verheij 2014 provides a good\noverview of the issues. \nInsofar as informal logic remains an attempt to develop a logic that\nis accessible to the everyday reasoner, it and computational modeling\nwill remain distinct endeavors. But both assume a theoretical\nunderstanding of the way in which informal reasoning works and should\nbe assessed. In the long run, the formal modeling AI requires may\nreestablish stronger links between formal and informal logic. The\nresults may foster the development of informal logic within a more\nintegrated logic (or argumentation theory) that acknowledges the\ndifferences between formal and informal logic, but recognizes an\noverarching model of argument that accounts for both. \nAs a field of study and research, informal logic has evolved into a\ncomplex attempt to understand the nature and assessment of informal\narguments. Though a list of informal logic issues cannot be\ndefinitive, the development already outlined suggest that a\ncomprehensive theory of informal argument (an “informal\nlogic”) should be made up of answers to a significant, cohesive\nsubset of the following questions. \nTo some extent, the relationship between informal logic and philosophy\nflows both ways. The practice of philosophy inevitably assumes (and\noften develops) some account of argument as it assembles evidence for\ndifferent philosophical perspectives. Informal logic assumes (and\noften develops) some view of the nature of reason, rationality and\nwhat counts as evidence and knowledge as it develops its theory of\nargument. The philosophical issues in play are tied to complex,\nunsettled questions about knowledge and evidence. \nInformal logic’s ties to epistemology are reflected in Mercier and\nSperber (2011), which argues that reasoning is a practice which has\nevolved from, and needs to be understood in terms of, the practice of\nargumentation. Johnson 2000 pushes in the opposite direction, arguing\nthat a comprehensive account of argument must be built upon a\nphilosophical account of rationality. The account of knowledge that\nGoldman 1999 develops situates it in the social interactions that take\nplace within interpersonal exchange and knowledge institutions. In\ndeveloping this account he pays considerable attention to informal\nargument and the constraints which make it a valuable practice.\nInformal logic’s relationship to the epistemological principles of\npragmatism is discussed in a 2002 volume of Philosophica\nwhich discusses informal logic in the context of Hilary Putnam’s\nphilosophy.  \nDespite these overlapping interests, informal logic has had limited\ninfluence on core philosophical disciplines. Woods 2000 speculated on\nthe reasons why. In part, informal logic’s position within philosophy\nreflects the broader fragmentation of philosophy in North America,\nRescher 2005 (p. 4) concluding that “The most striking aspect of\ncontemporary American philosophy is its fragmentation. The scale and\ncomplexity of the enterprise is such that if one seeks in contemporary\nAmerican philosophy for a consensus on the problem agenda, let alone\nfor agreement on the substantive issues, then one is predestined to\nlook in vain.” In a context characterized by increasingly\nindependent subdisciplines rather than shared interests, Rescher (p.\n9) notes that “The rapid growth of ‘applied philosophy’ …\nis a striking structural feature of contemporary North American\nphilosophy.” Informal logic is one aspect of this growth. \nTo some extent, informal logic’s relevance to philosophy does not lie\nin its influence on key philosophical disciplines so much as their\ninfluence on it. In North American and elsewhere, informal logic is a\nfield in which philosophers apply their theories of argument\n(rationality, knowledge, etc.) to everyday argument. In keeping with\nthis, philosophers continue to be the core contributors to informal\nlogic, and philosophy departments in colleges and universities are the\ncore department which teach the courses which are informal logic’s\nfocus. The influence of these courses on enormous numbers of students\nrequires that we at least qualify Rescher’s remark (p. 22) that:\n“The fact is that philosophy has little or no place in American\npopular (as opposed to academic) culture… …philosophy\nnowadays makes virtually no impact on the wider culture of North\nAmerica.” \nOutside of philosophy, informal logic has been increasingly influenced\nby -- and has exerted its own influence on -- Rhetoric, Communication\nStudies, Discourse Analysis, Semiotics, Linguistics, and Artificial\nIntelligence. Inside and outside of philosophy, its attempt to build a\ncomprehensive theory of reasoning and argument has important\nimplications for our view of rationality, the nature of the mind and\nits processes, and the social, political and epistemological role of\nreasoning and argument. At this point, explorations of its\nimplications for philosophy of mind, ethics and epistemology remain\nrare and its focus continues to be the development for a broad theory\nof argumentation that can be a basis for the analysis and assessment\nof argument in a much broader range of contexts than those that have\ncharacterized traditional logic. Its growing relationship to\ncomputational modeling aims to provide this in a formal as well as\ninformal way, in machine as well as human reasoning.","contact.mail":"leogroarke@trentu.ca","contact.domain":"trentu.ca"}]
