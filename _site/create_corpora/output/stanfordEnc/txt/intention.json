As Elizabeth Anscombe wrote in a\nsimilar context, ‘it is implausible to say that the word is\nequivocal as it occurs in these different cases’ and from the\nfact that ‘we are tempted to speak of “different\nsenses” of a word which is clearly not equivocal, we may infer\nthat we are pretty much in the dark about the character of the concept\nwhich it represents’ (Anscombe 1963, p. 1).\n\n\n\nThe principal task of the philosophy of intention is to uncover and\ndescribe the unity of these three forms. This project matters for\nquestions in the philosophy of mind, but also for ethics, where it is\ninvolved in the doctrine of double effect, for epistemology, and most\nobviously, for the nature of practical reason.\n\n\n\nWe can classify theories of intention roughly but usefully on two\naxes. First, how do they find unity in the guises of intention? Do they\nexplain one in terms of another? Which, if any, do they treat as\nprimary? There is a deep opposition here between accounts that take\nintention to be a mental state in terms of which we can explain\nintentional action, and those that do not. Second, how do they\nunderstand the relation between intention and evaluative thought, which\nbears on the possibility of akrasia, and the relation between\nintention and belief, which bears on the nature and scope of\nself-knowledge? These questions arise whatever the relation between\nintending and doing. Sections 1 and 2 address the first axis of\ndisagreement, while sections 3 to 5 primarily address the second.\n\n\n\nIn ‘Actions, Reasons and Causes,’ Donald Davidson gave a\nreductive theory of ‘intention with which’ as\n‘syncategorematic’: the phrase does not refer to an event\nor state of the agent, but is a way of redescribing what she is doing\nin terms of a ‘primary reason,’ where this is understood\nas a pro-attitude towards actions having some feature, F,\nalong with the belief that the original action has that feature\n(Davidson 1963, pp.  5–8). It is in virtue of its relation to a\nprimary reason that the action counts as intentional, and this reason\ngives the intention with which the action is done. Davidson thereby\nunified, or took himself to have unified, intentional action and\nintention-with-which. \n\nAs he came to see, however, this story neglects and cannot easily\nincorporate prospective intention or intention for the future\n(Davidson 1978). There are apparent cases of ‘pure\nintending’ in which no steps of any kind are taken. Suppose that\nI intend to write a book review but have yet to open the book. On the\nface of it, such pure intending cannot be reduced to intentional\naction. What is more, once we recognize the existence of pure\nintending, ‘there is no reason not to allow that intention of\nexactly the same kind is also present when the intended action\neventuates’ (Davidson 1978, p. 89). If what I am doing\nintentionally takes time, as almost everything does, there will be\nearly phases in which I stand to the completion of the deed just as I\nstand to future actions I intend to perform but have yet to begin. \n\nThe majority of work since Davidson’s conversion has followed\nhim in acknowledging the state of prospective intention as\nirreducible to action, and has been led to seek unity in the forms of\nintention by explaining the others—intentional action and\nintention-with-which—in terms of intending as a mental state.\nRecently, however, philosophers inspired by Anscombe’s\nIntention have offered resistance to this move. Anscombe\ndenies that there is a sharp distinction between ‘I am doing\nA’ and ‘I am going to do A’\noffered as answers to the question ‘Why are you\ndoing B?’ (Anscombe 1963, pp. 39–40). Nor does she regard\nintention for the future as needing further explanation once\nintentional action and intention-with-which have been understood\n(Anscombe 1963, pp. 90–4). Thus, Anscombe appears\nto solve the problem of unity without acknowledging intention as a\nmental state. \n\nThe simplest version of this approach would emphasize the\n‘openness’ of the progressive, that ‘He is doing\nA’ does not imply that he will succeed in\ndoing A, or that he has or will get very far with it. (That I\nam crossing the road is consistent with being hit by a car the moment\nI step off the curb.) It then identifies the fact that S\nintends to do A with the fact that S is\ndoing A intentionally, though perhaps he has barely begun. If\nI intend to visit the zoo next Thursday, I am already on the way to\ndoing so. Here it is striking that we sometimes employ the present\nprogressive in anticipation: ‘Kieran is visiting the zoo next\nThursday’ sounds perfectly fine when said today, before I have\ntaken any overt steps (see Falvey 2000 pp. 25–6; Thompson 2008,\npp. 140–1; Moran and Stone 2009, pp. 145–6). \n\nA more subtle line would concede that we do not always use the\nprogressive quite so liberally, but insist that doing so carves nature\nat its joints. According to Michael Thompson (2008, pp. 91–2,\n133–46), intending to do A is not a mental state\nbecause it is not static; instead it is a form of imperfectivity or\nbeing in progress towards the intentional completion of an act, where\nthe progress may be so vestigial or ineffectual or interrupted that it\nwould be odd to remark, ‘He is doing A.’ (See\nThompson 2008, pp. 91–2, 133–45; Moran and\nStone 2009, pp. 146–8; Ferrero 2017.) The unity of prospective intention and\n‘doing A intentionally’ is that the latter, too,\nconsists of being in progress, though perhaps with the implication of\nsome success. \n\nAlong with this unity, and the hint supplied by the use of the\nprogressive in anticipation, there are two main arguments for the\ntheory of intending as being embarked on intentional action. First, it\nreadily explains why intending is always intending to do\nsomething. (For this argument, see Thompson 2008, pp. 120–3,\n127–8, 130–1, drawing on Baier 1970; Moran and Stone 2009,\npp. 143, 147.)  Although we sometimes report intention as a\npropositional attitude—‘I intend\nthat p’—such reports can always be recast as\n‘intending to…’ as when I intend to bring about\nthat p. By contrast, it is difficult to rephrase such mundane\nexpressions as ‘I intend to walk home’ in propositional\nterms. ‘I intend that I am (will be) walking home’\nsuggests indifference to getting there. ‘I intend that I (will)\nhave walked home’ suggests indifference to my present\nagency. ‘I intend that I walk home’ can only be read as an\nintention with a habitual object, describing a general practice of\ngetting home on foot; it is not directed at a particular action. If\nintending is being on the way to intentional action, it is no surprise\nthat its proper object—what one is on the way to doing—is\nnot a mere proposition or state of affairs, but something one might do. \n\nSecond, the theory of intending as being embarked on intentional\naction explains the unity of what Thompson calls\n‘naïve’ and ‘sophisticated’\nrationalization. (For this argument, see Thompson 2008,\npp. 97–9, 118–9, 132–4.) As well as explaining\naction by intention—‘He is doing A because he\nintends to do B’—we explain action by\naction—‘He is doing A because he is\ndoing B’—intention by intention—‘He\nintends to do A because he intends to\ndo B’—and intention by action—‘He\nintends to do A because he is doing B.’ On the\nface of it, moreover, ‘naïve’ explanations in terms\nof what someone is doing entail ‘sophisticated’\nexplanations that appeal to intention. At least when we are using the\n‘because’ of rationalization, ‘He is\ndoing A because he is doing B’ arguably\nentails ‘He is doing A because he intends to\ndo B.’ The same point holds for what is explained:\n‘He is doing A because…’ entails ‘He\nintends to do A because…’ If intending is being\non the way to intentional action, these are all forms of explanation\nby, and of, such progress. So, again, it is no surprise that they are\nbound together in just the way that they appear to be. \n\nIf we help ourselves to the ‘because’ of\nrationalization, we can further exploit the unity of its\n‘naïve’ and ‘sophisticated’ forms to give\na simple theory of intention-with-which. An intention with which one is\ndoing A is an intentional-action-in-progress that explains one’s\ndoing it. We thus complete the task of unification that was set by the\nthreefold division of intention for the future, intention-with-which,\nand intentional action, all of which are modes of, or modes of\nexplanation by, being embarked on intentional action. \n\nA final virtue of this account is that it captures the element of\ncommitment in intention, emphasized by Michael Bratman, among others\n(Bratman 1987, pp. 18–20). Intention is not merely predominant\ndesire.  When I decide to do something, and so intend to do it, I am\nembarked upon doing it. This vindicates the Aristotelian view that\naction itself is the conclusion of practical thought. \n\nBecause of its relatively recent recovery, and the prevalent\nacceptance of intention as a mental state, there has been little\nexamination of the present alternative. But some initial observations\ncan be made. First, it is in fact controversial that intending to\ndo A is necessary for doing A intentionally, as the\npresent theory predicts. This raises complications best considered\nlater on, in sections 2 and 4. (They are briefly discussed at Thompson\n2008, pp. 102–3.) \n\nSecond, and more obviously, there is room to doubt whether intending\nto do A is sufficient for me to count as doing it\nintentionally, even when we admit that I can be doing what I will\nnever successfully do. Isn’t there a distinction between taking\npreparatory steps towards doing A and beginning to do it, as\nin the contrast between buying flour and eggs with the intention of\nbaking, and turning on the oven the following week? This distinction\nmay be significant in ethics and the criminal law (Paul 2014). There\nis also the prospect of plans that require no preparatory steps, as\nfor instance, to blink tomorrow at 3:00pm. Isn’t some intending\nutterly pure, as Davidson thought? Once we move away from the simple\ntheory of intending as doing, however, and introduce the abstract\nnotion of imperfectivity or being in progress, it is more difficult to\nsay what such examples show. That the theory is false? Or just how\nliminal being in progress can be? \n\nMore telling, perhaps, is the possibility of making a mistake, as when\nI intend to walk home by the shortest possible route, but have taken a\nwrong turn. Do I count as being embarked on walking home by the\nshortest route? If not, the theory stands refuted. If so, I can be on\nthe way not only to doing something I will never do, because I will be\ninterrupted at the earliest moment, but something it is now impossible\nfor me to do. Can we explain how my doings are directed at that\nimpossible outcome except by appeal to the intention with which they\nare performed? \n\nThe arguments that motivate the theory of intending as being embarked\non intentional action are in any case inconclusive. As to the second,\nwhile it is a constraint on any theory of intention to show the unity\nof ‘naïve’ and ‘sophisticated’\nrationalization, insofar as they are really unified, it would take\nmuch further argument to show that this cannot be done while thinking\nof intention as a mental state (cf. Setiya 2007a,\npp. 51–2). Further demands for unity push towards that view. So,\nfor instance, if we hope to bring out what is common to the\nexplanations ‘He is doing A because he is\ndoing B’ and ‘He is doing A because\np’ where these entail, respectively, ‘He is doing\nA because he intends to do B’ and ‘He is\ndoing A because he believes that p,’ we will\nhave to relate intention to the mental state of belief. If intention\nis not itself a mental state, but a way of being in progress, such\nrelations are more puzzling.  They are taken up again in section\n5. \n\nAs to the first, those who think of intention as a mental state could\nexplain why its objects are restricted to actions by saying more about\nthe kind of state it is. For instance, if intention is a\nrepresentation that is such as to guide and control what it\nrepresents, its object must be as such as to be guided: it must be the\nsort of thing that can be in progress and move towards completion,\nsomething that can be done, not a mere proposition or state of\naffairs.  Alternatively, the restriction could be denied (as it is by\nDavis 1984, pp. 131–2; Ferrero 2013). Intending that p\nis fundamental, and intending to walk home can be explained in terms\nof it: I intend that I will have walked home by walking home. \n\nFinally, whatever view we take about the basic objects of\nintention—actions or propositions—it is a problem for the\ntheory of intending as being embarked on intentional action that these\nobjects can be logically complex. I intend not to be hit by a car as I\nwalk home. I intend to drink with dinner or have dessert, but not both. I intend to\nread a book tonight if there’s nothing on the radio. In none of these\ncases can we say, without contrivance, what action I am\nnow on the way to performing. Until it is supplied with an account of\nthese cases, and of the relation between intention and the mental\nstates with which it interacts, the theory of intending as being\nembarked on intentional action remains incomplete. \n\nIf prospective intention cannot be explained in terms of intentional\naction, or both in terms of being in progress, how can we preserve the\nunity of our three divisions? In particular, how does intentional\naction relate to prospective intention and intention-with-which? There\nare two obvious thoughts. The first is that doing A\nintentionally is doing it with some further intention, or doing\nsomething with the intention of thereby doing A. The second\nis that both phenomena are to be explained in terms of intention as a\nmental state. Let us take these possibilities in turn. \n\nThe idea of explaining intentional action through intention-with-which\nis associated with resistance to causal accounts of acting for a\nreason. It begins instead with intentional\nteleology—doing A in order to do B, or with\nthe intention of doing B—treating this as primitive and\nnot involving intention as efficient cause. If we assume that every\nintentional action is done for a reason, and that this reason can be\ncast in teleological form, we can identify doing A\nintentionally with doing A in order to do something else. We\nthereby unify two guises of intention. Difficulties arise, however,\nfrom the case of idle behaviour, in which I am doing A\nintentionally for no particular reason (Anscombe 1963, p. 25), and\nfrom the possibility—or necessity—that teleological\nseries come to an end. I am doing A in order to do B\nin order to do C … in order to do Z, which I\nam doing for its own sake. Not all intentional actions are performed\nwith a further end. The purported unity fades. In order to solve this\nproblem, George Wilson (1989) and Carl Ginet (1990, Ch. 6) appeal to\nintention de re. One need not intend one’s doing A\nto promote some further end in order to count as doing A\nintentionally. It is sufficient to intend, of something one is doing,\nthat it promote or constitute one’s doing\nA. \n\nThis way of putting things prompts the objection that merely having\nthat intention is not enough. If the intention is idle or ineffective,\none will not, despite one’s wishes, count as doing A\nintentionally, or as acting in order to do A (Mele 1992,\npp. 248–55).  We need to add a causal relation, after all. But\nthis objection misunderstands the teleological view. It is not that\nthe mere presence of a mental state—intending of … that\nit …—constitutes acting with an intention, or acting\nintentionally, but that intention-with-which is a basic form of\nteleology, distinct from causation, out of which we can construct the\nunity of intention. \n\nA deeper problem for the teleological approach is how to complete this\nconstruction with an account of prospective intention in terms of\nintention-with-which. In cases of pure intending, there is no\nintention with which I am doing anything yet. It is thus no accident\nthat Wilson (1989, pp. 222–30) is led to deny the possibility of\npure intention. When I intend to do A in the future, I am\ndoing something now with the intention of doing A, in that I\nintend, of what I am doing, that it promote or constitute my\ndoing A. The action in question may be overt, but it may be\nas minimal as keeping track of opportunities for doing A, or\nbiding my time. \n\nFinally, the teleological theorist must account for the connection\nbetween intentions with which one acts and psychological states of\nbelief and desire. Why does it follow from the fact that one intends,\nof what one is doing, that it promote or constitute one’s\ndoing A that one wants to do A and that one\nbelieves, of what one is doing, that it is a means to that end? These\nimplications make sense if intention is a species of desire that\ninteracts with means-end belief when one does A with the\nintention of doing B. They are more difficult to explain if\nintention-with-which is the basic material from which intention and\nintentional action are built. (This argument is developed at greater\nlength in Setiya 2011, pp. 146–9.) \n\nPressures of this kind push us towards the second approach, now\northodox in action theory, which aims to explain both intentional\naction and intention-with-which in terms of intention as a mental\nstate. According to the simplest possible view, an intentional action\nof doing A is the execution of a prior intention to\ndo A, and doing A with the intention of\ndoing B is intending, of one’s doing A, that it\npromote or constitute one’s doing B. \n\nThere are two immediate difficulties. First, although we sometimes\nform an intention prior to acting, this is not essential. I can wave\nmy arm intentionally without planning in advance. This fact elicits a\nrefinement often credited to Searle (1983, pp. 84–5): the\ndistinction between prospective intention and intention in action. In\nthe former case, one intends to do A, perhaps at some point\nin the future. In the latter, one intends to be doing it\nnow. When S is doing A intentionally, she is doing\nit in execution of an intention in action, though except in very\nunusual cases she also intends to do A: to complete the\naction she is in the midst of performing. \n\nThis refinement preserves the idea that doing A intentionally\nrequires an intention whose object is doing A. This is what\nBratman (1987, p. 112) has dubbed ‘the Simple View.’ It is\nopen to serious objections, the more subtle of which will be examined\nin section 4. For now, it is sufficient to note that I sometimes count\nas doing A intentionally when it is a merely foreseen and\nunintended consequence of what I intend to do. (See Harman 1976,\npp. 151–2; Bratman 1987, pp. 123–5.) Thus if I am paid to\npump water into the cistern of a house, and I continue to do so even\nwhen I realize that the water is poisoned, I poison the inhabitants of\nthe house intentionally, despite the fact that I did not intend or\ndesire such harm (cf. Anscombe 1963, pp. 41–2). Even here,\nhowever, an intention is executed: I intend to pump water into the\nhouse. In general, when it is not the execution of a directly\ncorresponding intention, doing A intentionally is a foreseen\nor desired consequence of an action that is. Admittedly, this\ncondition is necessary, not sufficient, for intentional action, a\nconcept whose vagaries are hard to map. But the execution of intention\nremains the core phenomenon from which all instances of intentional\naction are derived. \n\nAlong with such matters of detail, two problems of principle can be\nraised against the present approach. The first contends that it is\ntacitly circular, because the content of intention always includes the\nconcept of intentionality (Wilson 1989, pp. 274–5; Ginet 1990,\npp.  34–5). In prospective intention, I intend not only to\ndo A, but to do A\nintentionally, and the same point holds for the object of\nintention in action. This prevents us from explaining what it is to act\nintentionally in terms of intention as a mental state. \n\nThe force of this objection is unclear. While there is something wrong\nwith an account of what it is to φ that appeals to being or doing\nφ, it is not so obviously problematic to appeal to mental states\nthat represent something as being or doing φ. Our task is\nnot to introduce the concept of intentional action to someone who\nlacks that concept, but to spell out the metaphysics of\ndoing A intentionally. It is an open question whether\n‘metaphysical definition’—saying what it is to\nφ—can be permissibly circular, so long as the circularity is\ncontained in the scope of an attitude. Such circularity is\ncharacteristic of ‘response-dependent’ accounts of\nevaluative and other properties. (This response may fail if the\nattitude in question is knowledge; see Ford 2011, §4.) \n\nA more direct response to the challenge would deny its premise.  While\nit is true that the execution of intention is intentional action, it\ndoes not follow that the object of intention is\ndoing A intentionally (cf. Searle 1983, pp. 85–6.) If I\nintend to be smiling and am doing so involuntarily, I am doing what I\nintend, though not intentionally. Likewise, if I intend to skip\nbreakfast and do so because I forget about it, my intention was\nfulfilled, though not by intentional action. (These claims are\nconsistent with the view that, when I act for reasons, those reasons\nfigure in my intention as a Kantian ‘maxim’. In that case,\nmy intention is fulfilled, in its entirety, only if I act on them and\nthereby act intentionally. See Wallace 1999, pp. 60–2; Setiya\n2007a, pp. 39–49; Korsgaard 2008; Schapiro 2011; and, for resistance, Sinhababu 2013,\n§3. On the content of intention, more generally, see Harman 1976,\npp. 156–8; Velleman 1989, pp. 94–7; Mele 1992, Ch. 11; and\nRoss, pp.  255–7, Appendix B.) \n\nThe second problem is more a question: whether ‘the relation\nof being done in execution of a certain intention, or\nbeing done intentionally, is a causal relation between act\nand intention.’ (Anscombe 1983, p. 95) Anscombe denies that it\nis.  When she writes of ‘practical knowledge’ as\n‘the cause of what it understands’ she means formal not\nefficient cause, and then only when ‘the description of the\naction is of a type to be formally the description of an executed\nintention.’ (See Anscombe 1963, pp. 87–8, and for\nconflicting interpretations: Hursthouse 2000; Vogler 2002; Moran 2004;\nNewstead 2006; Velleman 2007; Paul 2011; Ford 2015; Schwenkler 2015;\nLavin 2016; Setiya 2016a; Campbell 2018a; Campbell 2018b.)  One source of\nconcern about intention as efficient cause is that intention need not\nprecede intentional action, while causes must precede their\neffects. But causal theorists may deny that claim about the\ntemporality of causes, conceiving intention as the simultaneous,\nsustaining cause of what one is doing (Thalberg 1984, pp.\n257–8). They can also accommodate the case in which intention is\nessential to, and thus not fully distinct from, the action it causes:\nfor things that cannot be done except intentionally, as perhaps\ngreeting and promising (Anscombe 1963, pp. 84–5). Even here,\nintention could play an efficient-causal role in its own execution\n(Setiya 2007a, pp 56–9). \n\nA more familiar anxiety turns on ‘causal deviance’\n(Davidson 1973, p. 79). If we are trying to say what it is to act\nintentionally, the condition of doing A because one so\nintends looks insufficient. For it says nothing about the causal path\nfrom intention to action. If I intend to be shaking in order to signal\nmy confederate, and this intention makes me nervous, so that I shake,\nI am shaking because I intend to do so—though not\nintentionally. My intention did not cause me to shake ‘in the\nright way.’ Nor is the ‘right way’ obviously a\nmatter of ‘proximate’ causation or the absence of causal\nintermediaries, since a causal theorist may well allow for neural\nintermediaries, and further intentions, in the causal path from\nintention to action. There is a failure of intentional action only\nwhen intermediaries are of the wrong kind. \n\nReactions to causal deviance vary widely. Some are convinced that the\nproblem is hopeless (Anscombe 1989, pp. 110–1; Wilson 1989,\nCh. 9; O’Brien 2007, Ch.  8); others that it can be solved by\nappeal to such phenomena as causal direction and guidance, which are\nfound outside the province of intentional action and therefore\nintroduce no circularity. (See Thalberg 1984; Mele 1992, Ch. 11;\nSetiya 2007a, pp. 31–2; and, for objections, Lavin 2013.) A\nrecent development finds a problem of causal deviance in the\nmanifestation of dispositions, even when they are dispositions of\ninanimate objects. Suppose I attach a fragile glass to an explosive\ndevice that detects whether it is attached to something fragile and if\nit is, shatters the object when it is struck. When the glass is\nstruck, it will break in part because it is fragile without\nmanifesting its fragility: the causal connection is wrong. Because the\nphenomenon deviance is in this way general, there is reason to hope we\ncan solve it for intentional action by appeal to resources we need\nelsewhere. (See Hyman 2014 on dispositions and desires.) \n\nIt is in any case unclear how the dispute about causal deviance bears on the\nproject of explaining intentional action through intention as a mental\nstate. Would that project survive if the relation of execution and the\ncorresponding ‘because’ were taken as primitive? Or in a\n‘disjunctive’ theory according to which intention in\naction has two distinct forms: doing A intentionally and\n‘mere’ intending, frustrated by the world? Like the\ntheory of intending as being embarked upon intentional action, the\ndisjunctive conception agrees with Aristotle that action is, or can\nbe, the conclusion of practical thought.  \n\nCorresponding issues have been pursued in the philosophy of\nperception, where causal and disjunctive theories are often opposed\n(as by Snowdon 1980–1), and in epistemology more\nbroadly. Instead of explaining knowledge as belief that meets further\nconditions, some epistemologists treat knowledge as basic, explaining\nmere belief as its defective form (McDowell 1995; Williamson\n2000). The parallel view of intentional action treats mere intending\nas a defective form of intentional action (O’Brien 2007;\nRödl 2007, Ch. 2; McDowell 2010, §7; Marcus 2012, Ch. 2). A\nquestion for this view is how the state of intending can be a form of\nsomething dynamic: the event or process of acting. To answer this\nquestion, we need to say more about the kind of state intention\nis. \n\nIf intention is a mental state in relation to which doing A\namounts to doing A intentionally, or with the further\nintention of doing B, that fact would unify the modes of\nintention with which we began. It would, however, tell us little about\nintending itself.  Does this state involve desire? Belief about what\none is doing or what one is going to do? Evaluative judgement? Similar\nquestions arise for those who deny that intention is a mental state\nand explain it as being on the way to intentional action. Must I want\nto perform an action I am thus embarked upon?  Believe that I am\nengaged in it? Hold it to be in some way good? \n\nIt is a matter of consensus in the philosophy of intention that\nintending to do A entails wanting to do A, in the\nmotivational sense for which the ‘primitive sign of wanting\nis trying to get’ (Anscombe 1963, p. 68). Doubts about\nthis entailment are attributed to ambiguities in ‘desire.’\nWhen I intend to do A reluctantly, from the motive of duty, I\nmay deny that I want to do it, but what I lack is\n‘appetite’ not ‘volition’ (Davis 1984,\npp. 135–40; Thompson 2008, pp.  103–5). \n\nIntending is thus a ‘pro-attitude’ of some\nkind—assuming, for simplicity, that intention is a mental\nstate. In his later work, Davidson specified this pro-attitude as\n‘an all-out, unconditional judgement that the action is\ndesirable’ (Davidson 1978, p. 99). He made two further\nrefinements. First, when one is doing A intentionally,\n‘at least when the action is of brief duration, nothing seems to\nstand in the way of an Aristotelian identification of the action with\n[all-out evaluative judgement]’ (Davidson 1978, p. 99). Second,\none counts as intending an action only if one’s beliefs are consistent\nwith one’s performing it; one cannot intend to do what one believes to\nbe impossible (Davidson 1978, pp. 100–1). \n\nIn an influential critique, Bratman objects that choice is possible\neven when one knows that neither option is more desirable than the\nother; one can decide between options that are equivalent or on a par\n(Bratman 1985, §V). If unconditional judgement presents its\nobject as more desirable than any alternative, Davidson’s theory\nwrongly prohibits such choice. If the judgement is merely that a given\naction is no less desirable than others, it permits me to\nintend A and intend B, even if I know that\nthey are incompatible. Against this, Bratman claims that it is\nirrational to intend A and intend B if one cannot\nrationally intend A-and-B, as when doing both is\ninconsistent with one’s beliefs. \n\nA related objection is that we can fail to act, or intend, in\naccordance with our evaluations. In a typical case of akrasia,\nI conclude that I ought to quit, but decide to continue smoking\ninstead. Davidson (1970) replied to this by distinguishing ‘all\nthings considered’ from ‘unconditional’ evaluative\njudgement. In ‘conditional’ or ‘prima facie’\njudgement one takes some body of considerations, r, to support\nA over B. All things considered judgement is the\nspecial case of this in which r includes all the\nconsiderations one holds relevant.  There is no inconsistency in\njudging that the sum of these particular considerations\nfavours A over B while judging that B is\nbetter than A, perhaps in light of other considerations one\nhas not specifically considered. Since it is the latter judgement that\nconstitutes intention, one can act intentionally against the\nformer. This is how Davidson makes sense of my continuing to\nsmoke. \n\nFew have been convinced by Davidson’s account. (A recent critic is\nMcDowell 2010.) Can’t we act—intentionally and without\nself-contradiction—against an unconditional evaluative\njudgement? Or fail to intend in accordance with one? Davidson himself\nconcedes that ‘A is better than B, all things\nconsidered’ entails ‘A is better\nthan B’ if ‘all things considered’ means\n‘all truths, moral and otherwise’ (Davidson 1970,\np. 40). He may intend this to be trivial, counting that fact\nthat A is better than B among the relevant\ntruths. But it is both plausible and non-trivial to claim\nthat A is better than B, in the relevant sense, if\nand only if the balance of reasons favours A over B,\nwhere the reasons are distinct from that evaluative fact. Since it is\npossible to grasp this connection, to hold that the balance of reasons\nfavours quitting, and still not intend to quit, Davidson’s theory must\nbe false. (A consequence of this fact is the need to distinguish\nweakness as akrasia from weakness as failure of will; see\nHolton 2009, Ch. 4.) \n\nIf we hope to defend an evaluative theory of intention, despite this\npossibility, we will have to equate intending with judgement of some\nother evaluative proposition, not entailed by claims about the balance\nof reasons (as in Rödl 2007, Ch. 2), distinguish kinds of\njudgement or ways of representing an action as to be done, one of\nwhich constitutes intending, the other of which we act against\nin akrasia (as in Tenenbaum 2007, Ch. 7), or otherwise weaken\nthe relationship between intention and the good (as in Shah\n2008). Whichever way we go, we will need to motivate the evaluative\ntheory. What is it about the role of intention in intentional action,\nor in practical reasoning, that requires it to take an evaluative\nshape? What is missing from theories of intention on which it does\nnot? \n\nHaving criticized Davidson’s theory, Bratman offers a diagnosis\nof his mistake that appeals to the functional role of intention as a\nmental state. According to Bratman (1985, §VI), Davidson neglects\nthe place of prospective intentions in cross-temporal and\ninter-personal coordination, and as inputs to further practical\nthought. There is room for doubt about this verdict, since all-out\nevaluative judgement may well appear as a premise of practical\nsyllogism (‘I ought to do A; doing B is a\nmeans to that; so I ought to do B’) and since it may\nsustain ‘diachronic autonomy,’ at least to some extent,\njust through the working of memory (a point emphasized by Ferrero\n2006). But Bratman is right to indicate a gap in Davidson’s\nstory, which he has done more than anyone to fill.\n \n\nFor Bratman (1987), intention is a distinctive practical attitude\nmarked by its pivotal role in planning for the future. Intention\ninvolves desire, but even predominant desire is insufficient for\nintention, since it need not involve a commitment to act: intentions\nare ‘conduct-controlling pro-attitudes, ones which we are\ndisposed to retain without reconsideration, and which play a\nsignificant role as inputs to [means-end] reasoning’ (Bratman\n1987, p. 20). The plans for action contained in our intentions are\ntypically partial and must be filled out in accordance with changing\ncircumstances as the future comes. \n\nAmong the advantages of being able to commit ourselves to action in\nadvance, albeit defeasibly, are: (i) the capacity to make rational\ndecisions in circumstances that leave no time to deliberate, or lend\nthemselves to deliberative distortion; (ii) the capacity to engage in\ncomplex, temporally extended projects that require coordination with\nour future selves; and (iii) the capacity for similar coordination with\nothers. \n\nBratman (1987, Ch. 3) argues that these advantages are best secured if\nour intentions are consistent with one another and with our beliefs,\nand if they conform to principles of means-end coherence—for\ninstance, that when we intend E and believe that\nintending M is necessary to achieve E, we also\nintend M. There is, he claims, a ‘pragmatic\nrationale’ for such requirements, ‘one grounded in [their]\nlong-run contribution to getting what we (rationally) want’\n(Bratman 1987, p. 35). \n\nResponses to Bratman’s theory have focused largely on the nature\nof these alleged requirements. Bratman (1987, §2.5) argues that\nintentions do not provide inputs to practical reasoning by providing\nadditional reasons. This conception is, on the one hand, too weak,\nsince it treats the fact that I have settled on doing A as\njust one consideration among many in favour of doing it, whereas\nmeans-end coherence is a strict or peremptory demand. And it is, on\nthe other hand, too strong, since it permits a form of illicit\nbootstrapping in which an irrational decision can generate a reason\nthat tips the balance in favour of acting on it. (Do intentions ever\nprovide reasons? Many deny this; see, for instance, Broome 2001;\nBrunero 2007; Cullity 2008; Kolodny 2011. But Bratman’s argument\nleaves room for such reasons, so long as the actions they support\nwould be rational without them. For versions of this point, see Chang\n2009; Ferrero 2010; Smith 2016.) \n\nBratman’s pragmatic theory gives intentions a substantive role\nin practical thought without treating them as reasons. But it faces\nproblems of its own. In structure, Bratman’s theory is akin to\nthe variety of rule-utilitarianism on which we have utilitarian\ngrounds for adopting a practice of punishment or promising that\nsometimes goes against considerations of utility. This structure\nprompts a serious dilemma. If reasons for adopting a practice or\npattern of reasoning transmit to the actions or inferences that fall\nunder it, as Rawls (1955) once argued, the problems of bootstrapping\nand peremptoriness return. All we have is a theory of why\nintentions provide reasons. But if reasons do not transmit in this\nway, the picture appears to be one of ‘rational\nirrationality’: having reason to adopt or sustain an irrational\npattern of reasoning, on the ground that the results of doing so are\nmostly for the best. Neither option is appealing. \n\nIn his 1987 book, Bratman in effect pursued the second path, hoping to\nsoften its peculiarity by distinguishing ‘internal’ and\n‘external’ perspectives on rationality and deliberation\n(Bratman 1987, §3.5). More recently, he has argued that the\nbenefits of consistency and coherence are more than pragmatic, since\nthey allow for a form of self-governance that is of non-instrumental\nvalue (Bratman 2009b), and that they are closely tied to the\nfunctional role of intentions as plans (Bratman 2009c,\n§§VIII–IX). He also adopts John Broome’s (2004)\nidea that the relevant norms take ‘wide scope.’ For\ninstance, it is irrational to [intend E, believe that\nintending M is necessary to achieve E, and not\nintend M]. It does not follow from this that, if one\nintends E, one is under rational pressure to intend the\nnecessary means, since one can just as well avoid the forbidden\ncombination of attitudes by giving up one’s intention for the\nend. By the same token, there is no need to admit that intentions\nprovide reasons for acting. We thus avoid both horns of the dilemma\nsketched above. How far this strategy succeeds is a matter of ongoing\ndispute (Setiya 2007b; Bratman 2009b; Brunero 2010; Way 2010). There\nis also a question how far Bratman’s functional explanation of\nmeans-end rationality commits him to a wider form of rationalism or\n‘constitutivism’ about practical reason (Setiya 2014;\nBratman 2018). \n\nA further objection to the demands for consistency and coherence in\nintention turns on an implication that Bratman (1987, Ch. 8) himself\ndraws out.  According to the Simple View, doing A\nintentionally involves an intention whose object is A. As\nBratman argues, however, it is sometimes rational to attempt\nboth A and B, hoping to achieve one or the other,\nwhen I know that I cannot do both. If I succeed in doing A, I\nwill have done so intentionally, and thus, on the Simple View, I must\nhave intended to do A. Considerations of symmetry imply that\nI also intended to do B. But then my intentions are not\njointly consistent with my beliefs. Bratman concludes that the Simple\nView is false, since it would be irrational to have such\nintentions. Instead, I intend to try doing A and to try\ndoing B, knowing that I can make both attempts, though both\ncannot succeed. Bratman admits that, when I try to do A, I\ntake the relevant means ‘with the intention’ of doing it.\nBut he finds this phrase ambiguous. On one reading, it ascribes the\nintention to do A, but in the present case it does\nnot. Instead, I merely ‘endeavour’ to do A, where\nthis is a matter of ‘guiding desire’ (Bratman 1987,\nCh. 9). \n\nThe main objection to this view, pressed forcefully by Hugh McCann\n(1991), is that it generates an unhappy proliferation of\nintention-like states, and that, by finding ambiguity in\n‘intention with which,’ it fails to unify the guises of\nintention. What is more, there are natural alternatives. One equates\nintention with guiding desire, defends the Simple View, and finds the\nrequirement of consistency defeasible. There is rational pressure to\nconform to it, in general, but this pressure can be outweighed, as\nwhen it makes sense to intend both A and B, despite\ntheir manifest inconsistency, hoping to achieve just one. Another\nalternative appeals to partial intention, by analogy with partial\nbelief (see Holton 2009; Goldstein 2016; Shpall 2016; Archer 2017;\nMuñoz 2018). There is also room for a more radical view, on\nwhich the reasons for being consistent in one’s intentions, or\nconforming to means-end coherence, reduce to the reasons for acting in\none way or another: Bratman’s alleged requirements are a\n‘myth.’ (See Raz 2005; Kolodny 2008; and for a qualified\nview that speaks to the persistence of intention, Tenenbaum 2014;\nTenenbaum 2018). \n\nA final objection to Bratman’s theory is more general, and would apply\nas well to the theory of intention as guiding desire. The question is\nwhether such accounts reveal the unity of intentional action,\nintention for the future, and intention-with-which.  McCann’s\nobjection concerned the latter. The more basic objection is about the\nrole of intention in intentional action. Bratman (1987, Ch. 8) does\nnot ignore this connection: he proposes necessary and sufficient\nconditions for doing A intentionally that rely on the state\nof intending, though not always the intention of doing A\nitself. But it is open to question how deep the envisaged unity\ngoes. Why must there be intention in intentional action, if intentions\nare plans? (See Velleman 2007, §3.)  \n\nA partial answer cites the need for direction and guidance in doing\nanything that takes time or requires the selection of means. But it is\nnot clear that such guidance requires intention (see Bratman 1987,\npp. 126–7 on spontaneous action). Nor would this forge a general\nconnection between the state of intending and the phenomenon of acting\nfor reasons or the application of Anscombe’s (1963, p. 9) question\n‘Why?’ If S is doing A on the ground\nthat\np, she is doing it intentionally. Bratman’s conditions do not\nexplain why intention must be involved in the antecedent of this\nconditional. Why must reasons attach to what I am doing by way of\nplans or guiding desires? One response is to admit that they may not:\nthere can be intentional action without intention (see Bratman 2000,\npp. 51–2). But if we hope to unify intention with intentional\naction, we cannot accept this. Intention must figure in the correct\naccount of acting for a reason, and thus intentionally. In order to\navoid disunity, the theory of intentions as plans (or as guiding\ndesires) needs such an account. \n\nAcknowledging these problems, some philosophers turn back to Davidson\nand the project of reducing intention to desire and means-end belief\n(see, especially, Ridge 1998; Sinhababu 2013; and, for discussion,\nMulder 2018). But others see a promise of unity in the\nidea—influentially proposed by Elizabeth Anscombe (1963,\npp. 11–15) and Stuart Hampshire (1959, pp. 95, 102)—that\nwhen S is doing A intentionally, S knows\nthat she is doing A. What is more, acting for a reason, in a\nsense that contrasts with mere purposive behavior (of the sort\ncharacteristic of other animals), essentially involves such knowledge:\nin acting for a reason, I know an explanation of what I am doing that\ncites that reason, and therefore know that I am doing it. That is why,\nfor Anscombe, the question ‘Why?’ is ‘given\napplication’ by the agent. Intentional action turns on knowing\nthe answer to that question. \n\nThis picture raises many difficulties, and needs considerable\nrefinement and defence. (For variations, see Velleman 1989; Velleman\n2000; Setiya 2007a, Part One; Rödl 2007, Ch. 2; Setiya 2016b.)\nSome will resist the claim that acting for a reason is acting with\nself-knowledge—though it is important to stress that the\nknowledge attributed here need not involve conscious belief. There is\nalso disagreement about the kind of explanation involved in giving the\nreasons for which one acts (Wilson 1989, Ch. 7; Ginet 1990, Ch. 6;\nDancy 2000; Davis 2005; Alvarez 2010; Setiya 2011). But if the picture\nis basically right, it suggests that the unity of intention can be\nfound in knowledge or belief about action.  Assuming that knowledge\nentails belief, the basic thought is that intention in action involves\nthe belief that one is doing A. Doing something for a reason\ninvolves a belief about one’s reason for doing it that\nconstitutes intention in action. And prospective intention, or\nintention for the future, involves a belief about what one is going to\ndo and why. The idea that intention involves belief is what unifies\nintentional action, prospective intention, and\nintention-with-which. (On an alternative view, which may be\nAnscombe’s, intention contrasts with belief: they correspond to\nradically different kinds of knowledge. See the treatment of mistakes\nbelow.) \n\nThe claim that intention entails belief—most commonly, that if\none intends to do A, one believes that one is going to\ndo it—is widespread among those who draw no\nparticular inspiration from Anscombe. (See Audi 1973; Harman 1976;\nDavis 1984; Ross 2009.) As Grice (1971, pp. 264–6) observed,\nthere is peculiarity of some sort in asserting ‘I intend to\ndo A, but I might not do it,’ a peculiarity readily\nexplained if intention is a species of belief. It is equally striking\nthat the ordinary expression of intention for the future is ‘I\nam going to do A’ (Anscombe 1963, p. 1), which looks like the\nassertoric expression of belief. The same point holds for intention in\naction: ‘What are you up\n to?’; ‘I am\ndoing A.’ Although such evidence is suggestive,\nhowever, it might be explained in other ways. (See Davidson 1978,\npp. 91, 100; for criticism, Pears 1985; and for more recent\ndiscussion, Levy 2018.) \n\nSo far, we have only the fragment of a theory, an alleged condition of\nintending, not an adequate account of what intention is. Here there\nare several possibilities. On the simplest proposal, to intend an\naction is to believe that one will perform it and to have an\nappropriate guiding desire (Audi 1973, p. 395). But a mere conjunction\nseems insufficient: the desire and belief could be utterly unrelated\n(Davis 1984, pp. 141–2). This prompts the suggestion that,\nwhen S intends to do A, his belief rests on his\ndesire: to intend an action is to believe that one will perform it on\nthe ground that one wants to do so (Davis 1984, p. 147; see also Grice\n1971, pp. 278–9). The principal defect of this account is that\nit makes the belief component of intention epiphenomenal. This belief\nmerely registers one’s activity: the motivational work is done by a\nprior desire. (Something similar is true on more subtle theories that\ndivorce the motivational role of intention from belief; as, for\ninstance, Ross 2009, pp. 250–1.)  If the claim that intention\ninvolves belief is to capture the essence of the will, not a\nsuperficial fact about the word ‘intend,’ the belief must\nbe implicated in the functions of intending and the explanation of\naction.  (For objections of this kind, see Bratman 1987,\npp. 19–20 and Mele 1992, Ch. 8 on ‘intention*’; on\nthe role of beliefs in planning for the future, see Velleman 1989,\nCh. 8; Velleman 2007.) \n\nThere is variation even among those accounts that give a motivational\nrole to belief. On Velleman’s early view, intentions are\n‘self-fulfilling expectations that are motivated by a desire for\ntheir fulfillment and that represent themselves as such’\n(Velleman 1989, p. 109). Such expectations interact with a general\ndesire for self-knowledge to motivate action by which they are\nconfirmed. More recently, Velleman has replaced the desire for\nself-knowledge with a sub-personal aim or disposition (Velleman 2000:\n19–21). Either way, his view threatens to generate what Bratman (1991,\npp. 261–2) calls ‘the problem of promiscuity’: in\nattributing a general desire for self-knowledge that motivates us to\nconform to our own expectations, it predicts that we will be just as\nstrongly motivated by beliefs that do not constitute intentions, like\nthe belief that I am going to trip over the step, or mispronounce a\nword. \n\nA different proposal, due to Harman (1976, p. 168) is that intentions\nare ‘conclusion[s] of practical reasoning’ (see also Ross\n2009, pp. 270–2). But it seems possible to intend an action\nspontaneously, for no particular reason. In later work, Harman looks\ndownstream of intention, rather than upstream: an intention is a\nbelief about what one is doing or what one is going to do that has the\npower to guide and motivate action through practical thought (Harman\n1986, pp. 375–6; Setiya 2007a, pp. 48–53). This claim\ninteracts with the question about ‘disjunctive’ theories\nleft unanswered at the end of section 2. If intention involves belief,\nthose who treat knowledge as basic, with mere belief its defective\nform, will take a similar view of ‘knowledge in intention’\n(Rödl 2007; Ch. 2; McDowell 2010, §7; Marcus 2012,\nCh. 2). In the good case, one’s intention in action involves\nknowledge of what one is doing: it entails, so cannot cause or\nmotivate, one’s action. In the bad case, one merely intends to\nact. If not its causal role, however, what distinguishes knowledge in\nintention from knowledge of other kinds? \n\nFinally, there is Anscombe’s own view, on which there is a\nnormative contrast between intention and ordinary belief. If one fails\nto act as one intends, and not through a mistaken belief about the\nmeans or possibilities for action, ‘the mistake is not one of\njudgment but of performance’ (Anscombe 1963, pp. 56–7).\nIntention sets a standard of success for what does. (For discussions\nof this point, see Frost 2014; Setiya 2016a; Campbell 2018a; Campbell\n2018b.) What is more, there is ‘a difference of form between\nreasoning leading to action and reasoning for the truth of a\nconclusion’ (Anscombe 1963, p. 60). Intention is justified by\nthe former, not the latter: by practical not theoretical reasoning\n(Anscombe 1963, pp. 57–62). \n\nIn this respect, Anscombe’s doctrine differs most sharply from\nVelleman’s. As well as thinking of intention as a kind of belief,\nVelleman holds that ‘practical reasoning is a kind of theoretical\nreasoning’ (Velleman 1989, p. 15; see also Ross 2009). In a\nreview of Velleman’s book, Bratman (1991, pp. 250–1) dubbed the\nconjunction of these claims ‘cognitivism about practical\nreason.’ It prompts what Davidson (1978, p. 95) called ‘the\nstrongest argument against identifying [intention] with\n[belief],’ that ‘reasons for intending to do something are\nin general quite different from reasons for believing one will do\nit.’ Though Velleman (1989, pp. 122–5) defends that\nidentification, one need not do so in order to accept the theory of\nintention as belief or the idea of ‘practical\nknowledge’ as ‘knowledge in intention.’ \n\nA more modest ‘cognitivism’ would hold that intention\nentails belief, that practical reasoning does not reduce to\ntheoretical, but that some requirements that govern intention are best\nunderstood as requirements of theoretical reason. It is often regarded\nas a virtue of such cognitivism that it explains why there should be\nan indefeasible requirement of consistency among intentions and\nbeliefs (Ross 2009, pp. 244–7). It has also been argued that the\nrequirement of means-end coherence follows from requirements of\ntheoretical reason on the beliefs that figure in our intentions\n(Harman 1976, p. 153; Wallace 2001; Setiya 2007b; Ross 2009,\npp. 261–5). If I intend to do E and thus believe that I\nwill do it, and I believe that doing M is a necessary means\nto doing\nE, but do not intend or believe that I am going to\ndo M, I fail to believe a practically salient logical\nconsequence of what I believe.  The principal challenge for a\ncognitivist account of means-end coherence is to explain why one must\navoid such theoretical failures by forming the relevant intention, not\njust the corresponding belief (Bratman 2009a). But once again, one\nneed not defend cognitivism, even in its less ambitious form, in\nconceiving intention as a kind of belief. \n\nThere are two main arguments against this conception. The first turns\non apparent cases of intention without belief. According to Davidson,\n‘[a] man may be making ten carbon copies as he writes, and this\nmay be intentional; yet he may not know that he is; all he knows is\nthat he is trying’ (Davidson 1971, p. 50; see also Davidson\n1978, pp.  91–4). Or imagine I am recovering from paralysis, and\nmovement slowly returns to my hand. At a certain point, I am not sure\nthat I can clench my fist. As it happens, I can. But if I try to do so\nbehind my back, under anesthesia, I may not believe that I am\nclenching my fist, even though—on the face of it—I am\ndoing so intentionally, and that is just what I intend (Setiya 2008, pp. 390–1). Something\nsimilar crops up in planning for the future. I intend to mail the\nbills on the way to work, but I know that I am forgetful, and don’t\nbelieve that I will do it (see Bratman 1987, pp. 37–8). \n\nSuch examples can be dealt with in various ways. One strategy insists\nthat, when I do not believe that I am clenching my fist, or that I\nwill mail the bills, I do not intend the corresponding actions, I\nmerely intend to try (Harman 1986, pp. 364–5; Velleman\n1989, pp. 115–6). But do I really act as I intended if I try and\nfail? (See Pears 1985, p. 86; McCann 1991, p. 212.) And when I know\nthat I am forgetful, do I even believe that I will try to mail the\nbills? A more radical theory points to the simplifying assumption,\noften made in epistemology, that belief\nis binary and does not come by degree. On that assumption, it may be\nharmless to claim that intention involves belief. But the truth is\nbound to be more complex: that in forming an intention one becomes\nmore confident than one would otherwise be (Setiya 2008,\npp. 391–2); or that the will is a capacity to know what one is\ndoing, or what one is going to do, whose exercise may be impeded,\nyielding mere belief or partial belief instead of knowledge (Pears\n1985, pp. 78–81; Setiya 2009, pp. 129–31; Setiya 2012, pp. 300–303). \n\nA final response casts doubt on the examples. When we recall the\n‘openness’ of the progressive, we can insist that\nDavidson’s carbon-copier knows that he is making ten copies,\neven if he is not sure the copies are going through first time (see\nThompson 2011). It is not a condition of being embarked on intentional\naction that one will in fact succeed. The same might be said when I am\nclenching my first, if what I know is merely that I am in progress\ntowards doing so, in some liminal way. (This points back to the theory\nof intending as doing, discussed in section 1.) This strategy\nstruggles with prospective intention and the belief that I am going to\nact. But its advocates may insist that the content of prospective\nintention is also imperfective (Thompson 2008, pp. 142–5). We\nhave practical knowledge only of what is in progress, not what has\nhappened, or what will. \n\nThe second objection is epistemic. If forming an intention is, among\nother things, coming to believe that one is doing A, or that\none is going to do A, what entitles us to form such beliefs?\nNot, or not ordinarily, that we have sufficient evidence of their\ntruth. Forming an intention is not predicting the future on the basis\nof what one takes to be, or what ought to be, adequate grounds. That\nis why Anscombe calls practical knowledge ‘knowledge without\nobservation,’ meaning to exclude not only observation in the\nnarrow sense but knowledge by inference (Anscombe 1963, p. 50). And it\nis why Velleman (1989) writes about ‘spontaneous’\nknowledge of action. Even though he hopes to reduce practical to\ntheoretical reasoning, and holds that intention involves belief, he\ndenies that intentions are formed on the basis of sufficient prior\nevidence. Anscombe and Velleman concede that knowledge in intention\noften rests in part on observation; the claim is that it goes beyond\nwhat observation, or inference from prior evidence, can support. (For\ndiffering views of the role of perception in practical knowledge, see\nPickard 2004; Gibbons 2010; Schwenkler 2011; Ford 2016.) \n\nThe postulation of beliefs formed without sufficient prior evidence is\nsometimes taken as a fatal flaw. In a memorable formulation, Grice\n(1971, p. 268) wrote that it makes decision ‘a case of licensed\nwishful thinking.’ According to Grice, we are not epistemically\npermitted to form beliefs about what we are doing, or what we are\ngoing to do, without sufficient prior evidence. Instead, we know what\nwe are doing, or what we are going to do, by inference from the\ncondition of our will, along with premises about our own abilities\n(Grice 1971, pp. 275–9; Paul 2009). The condition of the will\ncannot itself involve belief. \n\nReactions to this problem vary widely. Those who restrict the content\nof intention to what is in progress and emphasize how little is\ninvolved in being embarked on intentional action may suggest that the\nbeliefs in question verify themselves. It is sufficient for\ndoing A intentionally, in the relevant sense, that one\nintends to do it. As we saw in section 1, however, there are reasons\nto doubt this sufficiency. And the view seems to deflate the interest\nof practical knowledge. Anscombe warns against the ‘false avenue\nof escape’ on which ‘I really “do” in the\nintentional sense whatever I think I am doing’ (Anscombe 1963,\np. 52), and seems to allow for practical knowledge of what I will\nactually do (Moran 2004: 146; Setiya 2016a). \n\nOther views account for knowledge in intention in reliabilist terms:\nwhere one’s intention to do A reliably issues in\ndoing A, it may amount to knowledge of what one is doing, or\nwhat one is going to do (Newstead 2006, §2; Velleman 2007,\n§5). Non-reliabilists may dismiss the need for prior evidence,\nholding that we are entitled to form a belief if we know that it will\nbe true, and that we will have sufficient evidence for its truth, once\nformed; this condition can be met when we form an intention to act\n(Harman 1976, p. 164, n. 8; Velleman 1989, pp.  56–64). So long\nas I know what I intend, and that my intention will be effective, I\nhave sufficient evidence for what I am doing, or what am I going to\ndo, even though this evidence did not precede the forming of my\nintention. \n\nCritics may object to the necessity of these conditions. According to\nBerislav Maruši&cacute; (2015), I can form the ‘practical\nbelief’ that I will do A without knowing that my\nintention will be effective, so long as I know that its execution is\nup to me. A more common objection is that the conditions are not\nsufficient. They assimilate intention to faith, as when I form the\nbelief that I can leap a great chasm even though I have no evidence of\nmy ability to do so, knowing that the belief itself will ensure\nsuccess. It is not clear that such acts of faith are possible, that\nthey are epistemically rational, or that they provide a plausible\nmodel for intention (Langton 2004; Setiya 2008, §III). On an\nalternative view, there is a general demand for prior evidence in\nforming beliefs, but our intentions are sometimes exempt from it, as\nperhaps when we know how to perform the relevant acts (Setiya 2008;\nSetiya 2009; Setiya 2012). It is know-how that explains why the\nexecution of our intentions, and thus the truth of the beliefs that\nthey involve, can be credited to us. \n\nAnscombe’s position on the matter is elusive, and may have to do\nwith her normative claims about intention and belief. Is practical\nknowledge exempt from ordinary requirements of evidence because there\nis a mistake of performance, not of judgement, when its object is\nfalse? (See Anscombe 1963, pp. 4–5, 56–7; Campbell 2018a.)\nWould it then amount to knowledge of what is not the case? Anscombe\nmay seem to suggest as much (Anscombe 1963, p. 82), but it is unclear\nwhether she accepts or merely entertains this prospect. \n\nImplicit these debates is a question about the scope of\ngroundless (non-perceptual, non-inferential) self-knowledge. A blanket\nobjection to beliefs formed without sufficient prior evidence cannot\nbe sustained: I often know what I believe without having come to know\non the basis of perception or inference. Is groundless knowledge of\nthis kind restricted to our mental states? Or can it extend to what we\nare doing and what we are going to do? Compare externalism about\ncontent: at least typically, believing that p has\nimplications for the constitution of the world outside one’s skin; but\nit remains accessible to self-knowledge (Burge 1988). Why should that\nnot be true of intentional action? On any reading, part of the aim of\nAnscombe’s Intention was to break the Cartesian prejudice\nagainst self-knowledge of what is happening in the world. If she\nfailed in that endeavour, she at least prescribed a task for future\nwork: to say whether it is indeed a prejudice or a decisive obstacle\nto the possibility of practical knowledge and the theory that\nintention involves belief.","contact.mail":"ksetiya@mit.edu","contact.domain":"mit.edu"}]
