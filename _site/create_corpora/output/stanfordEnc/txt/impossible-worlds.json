Yet\n Hegel\n complained that it is “one of the fundamental prejudices of\nlogic as hitherto understood” that “the contradictory\ncannot be imagined or thought” (Hegel 1931: 430). On this\napproach, our representational capabilities are not limited to the\npossible: we are able to conceive, describe, and sometimes even\nbelieve, impossibilities.\n\n\nThis entry is about impossibilities. In order to read it fruitfully,\nyou might also want to consult the entry on\n possible worlds.\n Many accounts of impossible worlds are best understood against the\nbackground of possible worlds theories — although symmetries and\nsimilarities can sometimes break down in important respects. (We will\nsee one in\n section 4\n below.) You might also want to look at the entry on\n modal logic\n to grasp some basic notions of worlds semantics.\n\n\nWe commonly speak of things being impossible in a relative\nsense. If you are stuck in a traffic jam in Paris Montparnasse at 2\nPM, and your flight is leaving from airport Charles De Gaulle at 2:30\nPM, you may moan: “There is no way that I can make it to the\nairport in time”. What you mean is that, given the timing, the\nmeans of transport available, and other circumstances, it is\nimpossible for you to reach the airport in time. It is not absolutely\nimpossible: if you had Star Trek’s transporter, you could make it.\n\n\nThis entry is about worlds that are not possible, with\n“possible” understood in an unrestricted sense. Start with\nthe intuitive idea of the totality of possible worlds, which capture\nall and only the genuine possibilities. The worlds we are interested\nin are not in there. These worlds are often called logically\nimpossible worlds, as logical laws such as the Law of\nNon-Contradiction or the Law of Excluded Middle are assumed to be the\nmost general and topic-neutral: they are supposed to hold at all\npossible worlds. From now on, we are talking of impossible worlds\nsimpliciter, meaning worlds that are not possible with\nrespect to an unrestricted notion of possibility, however this is\nfurther characterized.\n\n\nA look at the rapidly growing literature on impossible worlds (see\nNolan 2013 for a survey) presents us with a number of definitions.\nThese can be reduced to four main items:\n\n\nImpossible Ways: just as possible worlds are often introduced\nintuitively by characterising them as ways things could have been, so\nare impossible worlds often characterized as ways things could not\nhave been. The initial insight is that not everything is possible,\nthat is, some things just (absolutely) cannot happen. Anything that\njust can’t happen must be an absolute impossibility; and these\nways the world just couldn’t be are impossible worlds (see e.g.\nSalmon 1984; Yagisawa 1988; Restall 1997; Beall & van Fraassen\n2003). \n\n\nLogic Violators: another definition has it that impossible\nworlds are worlds where the laws of logic fail. This depends on what\nwe take the laws of logic to be. Given some logic L, an impossible\nworld with respect to the L-laws is one in which some of those laws\nfail to hold (see e.g. Priest 2001, Chapter 9). An impossible world in\nthis second sense will be an impossible world in the first sense,\ngiven that logical necessity is unrestricted. But not vice versa.\nSuppose it’s metaphysically necessary that the Mona Lisa (if it\nexists) was painted by da Vinci. Then a world in which the Mona Lisa\nwas painted by Neil Buchanan on Art Attack is an impossible\nworld in the first sense but not in the second, for it does not\nviolate any logical law.\n\n\nClassical Logic Violators: another definition has it that\nimpossible worlds are worlds where the laws of classical\nlogic fail (see e.g. Priest 1997a). A world complying with\n intuitionistic logic,\n and where instances of the Law of Excluded Middle fail, will be\nimpossible in the third sense.\n\n\nContradiction-Realizers: a still more specific definition has\nit that an impossible world is a world where sentences of the form\n\\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold, against the Law of\nNon-Contradiction (see e.g. Lycan 1994). Impossible worlds of the\nfourth kind will be impossible in the third sense, but not vice versa.\nOur intuitionistic world above will have the Law of Non-Contradiction\nhold unrestrictedly: it will be impossible in the third, but not in\nthe fourth sense.\n\nWhy might one believe in impossible worlds? One argument is the\nso-called “argument from ways” (Vander Laan 1997), which\nis related to the first definition of impossible world given above.\nThis draws on the analogy with\n David Lewis’s\n notorious argument concerning our quantifying over ways things could\nhave been (see Lewis 1973: 84). The world could have been different in\nso many ways: Hilary Clinton could have won the 2016 US election, I\ncould be dancing on the ceiling, and Fermat’s Last Theorem could have\nremained without proof. Our belief in possible worlds is just a\nparaphrase of our belief that there are many ways the world could have\nbeen. \nAren’t there also ways the world could not have been? Some\nauthors endorse the claim that anything is possible (e.g.\nMortensen 1989). However, the majority of philosophers believe that\nnot everything is possible, in the sense that some things just\ncan’t happen. If I tell you that my college has a cupola\nwhich is both fully round and fully square, you are likely to reply,\n“it can’t be that way!”. So it seems that\n“‘ways’ talk goes both ways” (Beall and van\nFraassen 2003: 86). If quantification on ways the world could have\nbeen should be taken at face value as providing evidence for possible\nworlds, then quantification on ways the world could not have been\nshould be taken at face value as providing evidence for impossible\nworlds. \nThe argument as such is hardly convincing. Firstly, one author’s\nmodus ponens is another’s modus tollens. Some have\nused similar considerations to argue against Lewis’s modal realism\n(see Skyrms 1976; Naylor 1986): if one believes in possible worlds (of\nthe Lewisian kind) as ways things could have been, then by parity of\nreasoning one should believe in impossible worlds (ditto) as ways\nthings could not have been. But impossible worlds are too much to\nswallow, so (by modus tollens) one should not believe in\nLewis’s modal realism. \nSecondly, taking quantification over any kind of entity whatsoever at\nface value, just because it is embedded in ordinary language, doesn’t\nlook like a promising general strategy. Lewis’s case for accepting\ncommitment to possible worlds did not consist just in an argument from\nways. He also provided independent motivation for taking\nquantification over possible worlds at face value. A non-reductive\naccount of possible worlds, according to Lewis, brings net theoretical\nutility. The ontological cost is compensated by a theoretical gain,\ngiven the variety of ontological, semantic, and conceptual\nexplanations allowed by our taking the notion of possible world\nseriously. This is likely to be the main motivation for believing in\nimpossible worlds. As we will see below, defenders of impossible\nworlds claim that they are are theoretically useful. \nAnother argument on behalf of impossible worlds, quite pervasive in\nthe literature, comes from counterpossible reasoning (e.g.\nBeall & van Fraassen 2003, Chapter 4; Nolan 1997; Restall 1997;\nBrogaard & Salerno 2013). This is reasoning from suppositions,\nassumptions, or conditional antecedents which are not only false, but\nimpossible. We can reason non-trivially from impossible suppositions,\nby asking what would be the case, were (say) the Law of\nExcluded Middle false. To say that we reason non-trivially\nfrom an assumption means just that we accept some conclusions but\nreject others on the basis of that assumption. If we hypothetically\nsuppose the Law of Excluded Middle to be false, for example, then we\nwould likely conclude that intuitionistic logic would be preferable to\nclassical logic, given that supposition. We are unlikely to conclude\nthat classical logic would be a satisfactory logic, or that scarlet\nwould be a shade of green, given that supposition. The point readily\ngeneralizes to reasoning about entire theories and to serious\nphilosophical and logical debates. We often reason from suppositions\nabout the truth of certain logical, mathematical, or metaphysical\ntheories which, if in fact false, are necessarily false, because of\nthe very nature of their subject matter. \nThis kind of reasoning is related to our assessment of certain\nconditional statements with impossible antecedents, often called\ncounterpossible conditionals or, more simply,\ncounterpossibles. These include statements such as, if\nExcluded Middle were false, classical logic would not be an acceptable\nlogic. Let’s call a conditional like this trivially true\nwhen it is true and the conditional with the same antecedent and\nopposite (negated) consequent is also true. Consider these\nexamples: \nThe first is intuitively true, the second intuitively false. If that’s\ncorrect, then there are non-trivially true counterpossibles. These\nconsiderations impact on our preferred semantics for such\nconditionals, for the possible worlds semantics for conditionals has\ntrouble accommodating this position. Yet the analysis in terms of\nworlds does a good job for conditionals with possible antecedents.\nThis motivates a semantics for counterpossibles in terms of impossible\n(as well as possible) worlds. We will get into more detail in\n section 2.5. \nThese kinds of argument highlight the usefulness of impossible worlds\nas devices for analyzing particular linguistic, logical, and\nphilosophical issues. The point can be expanded into the general\n“argument from utility” mentioned above: we should believe\nin impossible worlds because they are useful tools for logicians and\nphilosophers. Whether that general argument is acceptable depends on\nhow persuasive the specific impossible worlds analyses are. Let’s look\nat some. \nThis section briefly describes various applications of impossible\nworlds, which collectively provide the main motivation for introducing\nthem. \nModelling intentional states, such as knowledge and belief, is a\nprominent motivation for introducing impossible worlds. The intuitive\nidea is that one gains knowledge or belief by ruling out would-be\npossibilities (the epistemic/doxastic possibilities for that\nagent). An agent’s knowledge is whatever is true according to all\nepistemically possible worlds accessible to that agent, i.e., the\nworlds which represent ways things could be, for all the agent knows\n(and similarly for belief). \nImpossible worlds are useful within this approach because these\nwould-be possibilities often turn out to be impossible. Our beliefs\nare often (covertly) inconsistent with one another. Moreover, our\nknowledge and belief is not closed under (classical) logical\nconsequence: we do not know or believe all consequences of what we\nknow or believe. It is hard to accommodate these features using only\npossible worlds. Possible worlds models usually generate the problem\nof logical omniscience (see\n epistemic logic),\n which we will discuss in\n section 5.3. \nOne feature of rational agents’ intentional states is that they\ntypically reject obvious impossibility or absurdity whilst\nbeing subject to subtle inconsistency (Lewis 2004). One\nattempt to capture this feature is developed through Jago 2006, 2007,\n2009, 2014a. The idea is that only genuine possibilities and\nnon-obvious impossibilities should be epistemically accessible to\nrational (but imperfect) agents such as us. For some agents, it may be\nepistemically possible that Fermat’s Last Theorem’s is false, but 0\nbeing 1 shouldn’t be epistemically possible for anyone. That’s why we\nknow the latter but may fail to know the former, says Jago. One worry\nwith this approach is that it is in part proof theoretic, whereas it\nisn’t clear that proof length correlates well with obviousness.\nBjerring (2013) presents other objections to the view. A strategy\nsimilar to Jago’s is adopted in Berto 2014, 2017. \nA quite different application of impossible worlds to epistemic states\nhas been proposed by JC Beall 2009, in relation to the\n Church-Fitch knowability paradox.\n The Church-Fitch reasoning is supposed to show that is contradictory\nto suppose that any truth can be known (as some anti-realists\nclaim). The reasoning is this. Suppose all truths are knowable but\nsome are not in fact known. Then some truth \\(A\\), is not known:\n\\(A \\wedge \\neg KA\\). By assumption, it’s possible to\nknow this: \\(\\Diamond K(A \\wedge \\neg KA)\\). Seemingly\ngood reasoning (in classical epistemic logic) implies that it’s\npossible both to know and not know that \\(A\\):\n\\(\\Diamond(KA \\wedge \\neg KA)\\), which of course\nisn’t possible at all. The usual moral to draw is that not all\ntruths are knowable. Beall’s idea, by contrast, is that the\nknowability principle can be maintained (and the corresponding kind of\nanti-realism along with it). His suggestion is to deny\ndistribution of knowledge over conjunction: the principle\nthat knowing that \\(A \\wedge B\\) implies knowing that\n\\(A\\) and knowing that \\(B\\). He achieves this using\nimpossible worlds in which conjunctions may be true even if their\nconjuncts are not. \nClosely connected with inconsistent information is the issue of\nmodelling inconsistent databases (see Barwise 1997). These\nmay consist, for instance, in sets of data supplied by different\nsources which are inconsistent with each other, such as incompatible\nevidence presented by different witnesses in a trial. Intuitively, we\nare allowed to draw the logical consequences of data fed in by a\nsingle source, but should not conjoin data from distinct\nsources which may be inconsistent with each other. The data base is\n“compartimentalized”: occasional inconsistencies are\nplaced in separate sectors and should not be asserted conjunctively\n(see e.g., Hyde 1997, Brown & Priest 2004). Impossible worlds are\nuseful in such models—particularly non-adjunctive\nworlds, where a conjunction may be false even if both conjuncts are\ntrue. (We discuss such worlds further in\n section 5.2.) \nInconsistent information is at issue also in certain works of\nfiction.\nLewis’s classic 1978 paper proposed an analysis of the expression\n“true in such-and-such fiction” in terms of possible\nworlds. What holds in a certain fictional work is what holds at a set\nof possible worlds, properly selected via a series of (quite subtle\nand complex) clauses. But fiction can be occasionally inconsistent.\nSometimes, this happens unintentionally: Conan Doyle’s The Sign of\nthe Four describes Watson as limping because of a war wound at\nhis leg. In A Study in Scarlet, however, Watson has no wound\nat his leg (for his wound is in his shoulder and he doesn’t limp). One\nmay claim that the set of worlds that make such stories true has to be\nsplit into disjoint subsets, making true consistent fragments of the\nfiction. This strategy won’t always work, however, for inconsistencies\nin fiction may be intentional (as stressed in Proudfoot 2006). Suppose\nwe write a novel, and in its first chapter we have the Mad\nMathematician produce a round square. If the intentional inconsistency\nis excised, the fact that mathematicians all over the world are amazed\nby this result in the second chapter becomes unexplainable. A natural\ntreatment of these cases, then, is obtained by admitting\n(appropriately selected) impossible worlds in the set of situations\nthat realize what is told in the story (see e.g. Priest 1997b; Woods\n2003, Chapter 6; Berto 2012, Chapters 7 and 8, Badura and Berto\nforthcoming). \nClosely connected to belief is the notion of propositional\ncontent. Within possible worlds semantics,\n propositions\n can be defined as functions from worlds to truth values, or as sets\nof worlds: a proposition is the set of worlds at which it is true. The\naccount is notoriously too coarse-grained (Barwise 1997). Intuitively\ndistinct impossible propositions (that swans are blue and not blue;\nthat Fermat’s Last Theorem is false; that Charles is a married\nbachelor) all hold at precisely no possible worlds. And we have a dual\nproblem with (unrestrictedly) necessary propositions, which are all\nidentified with the set of all possible worlds. Treating propositions\nas set-theoretic constructions out of possible worlds leads to a very\ncoarse individuation of propositions, and because of this it has been\nsubject to seemingly devastating attacks, for instance, by Scott\nSoames 1987. However, impossible worlds allow for fine-grained\ndistinctions unavailable in standard possible worlds semantics. An\nimpossible proposition need not be equated with the empty set of\nworlds, for it may be a set which includes (only) impossible worlds.\nWe can have an impossible world \\(w_1\\) with impossibly\ncoloured swans, a distinct impossible world \\(w_2\\) at\nwhich Fermat’s Last Theorem is false, and a further impossible world\n\\(w_3\\) at which bachelors are married (but at which\nswans and Diophantine equations behave correctly). Ripley (2013)\nargues that an account along these lines is a better strategy for\naddressing the coarse-grainedness problem than resorting to\n structured propositions. \nOne other application of impossible worlds concerns\nperceptual impossibilities. When we see an Escher drawing or\na Penrose triangle, our experience has content. But that content is\nimpossible: such structures cannot be realised. The content of our\nexperience in such cases is naturally captured using impossible\nworlds. Splitting that content into smaller internally consistent\nparts would lose the essential feature of the whole. This issue is\nexplored in Mortensen 1997. \nPerhaps the most important application of impossible worlds has to do\nwith counterpossible reasoning, understood as counterfactual reasoning\nfrom impossible antecedents. As we saw in\n section 1,\n this kind of reasoning is often taken to provide independent\nmotivation for believing in impossible worlds. In Lewis-Stalnaker\ntheories of counterfactuals, a conditional of the form, “if it\nwere the case that \\(A\\), then it would be the case that\n\\(B\\)” is true if and only if, at the closest world (or\nclosest worlds) at which \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is also true.\n(This is a simplification of the truth conditions provided in the\nfull-fledged semantics of Lewis 1973.) \nWhile the standard conditional logics based on this idea have been\nquite successful in the treatment of counterfactuals, the approach\nentails that any counterfactual whose antecedent is impossible is\nvacuously true. For if there are no possible worlds at which\n\\(A\\) is true, then trivially, all closest \\(A\\)-worlds\n(worlds where \\(A\\) is true) are \\(B\\)-worlds. This is\nunsatisfying in many respects, for we often need to reason\nnontrivially about theories that (perhaps unbeknownst to us) cannot\npossibly be correct; and we often need to reason from antecedents that\nmay turn out to be not only false, but necessarily so. (Compare the\nexample conditionals (1.1) and (1.2) in\n section 1\n for an example.) \nThree contexts in which theories of this kind show up are discourses\non (1) alternative logics, (2) mathematical conjectures, and (3)\nmetaphysical views. We will now say a few words on each of them. \n(1) A famous Quinean motto has it that “to change the logic is\nto change the subject”: apparently disagreeing logical parties\nare actually speaking of different things. So when intuitionists deny\nthat the Law of Excluded Middle holds in non-finitary contexts, they\nare actually changing the meaning of logical operators; when\nparaconsistentists claim that some formula can be true (in some weird\ncircumstances) together with its negation, they are not talking\nof negation anymore (see e.g., Berto 2008). \nBut this does not make good sense of many disputes between\nintuitionists, classical logicians, paraconsistentists, quantum\nlogicians, etc. It is more fruitful to assume that each party\ngenerally understands the rival logics as intelligible, albeit\nnecessarily false, theories. Even if classical logic actually is the\none true logic, one can reason counterpossibly about what would be the\ncase if a certain non-classical logic were the correct one (e.g.,\n“if intuitionistic logic were correct, then the Law of Excluded\nMiddle would fail” is true and “if intuitionistic logic\nwere correct, then the Law of Explosion would fail” is false).\nOne can take into account situations in which the Law of Excluded\nMiddle fails and argue about what would and would not be the case in\nthem. These situations are, by classical standards, just impossible\nworlds (of the third kind: Classical Logic Violators). \n(2) Similar claims can be made for mathematical conjectures. Different\nset theorists have different views on controversial subjects such as\nnon-well-founded sets, the\n Continuum Hypothesis,\n the Axiom of Choice, the set/(proper-)class distinction, etc. If one\nembraces the Platonic view (subscribed to, at least implicitly, by\nmany set theorists) that there is One True Universe of sets, then at\nmost one of the alternative set theories can be correct: the others\nare wrong, and necessarily so. But people can work under the\nhypothesis that a necessarily false basic mathematical principle\nholds, and reason coherently from this: \nField takes this as an argument to the effect that mathematical\nnecessity is not coextensive with logical necessity. But we can turn\nthe tables around: mathematical necessity is unrestricted and false\nmathematical theories are just impossible theories. \n(3) The third area in which counterpossible reasoning comes into play\nare metaphysical disputes (and more broadly, any philosophical dispute\nwhose subject matter is necessarily true or necessarily false). Much\nmetaphysical talk is made with our quantifiers “wide\nopen”, that is, aiming at stating truths about all that there\nwas, is, or could possibly be. This is evident in modal ontology, when\npeople advance a theory on the totality of worlds and on their nature.\nBut other metaphysical debates easily come to mind. Suppose a\nphilosopher wants to evaluate metaphysical theories which she\nconsiders wrong (say, in order to draw unpalatable consequences by way\nof criticism), such as Spinoza’s monism or Hegel’s metaphysics of the\nAbsolute. She must envisage situations where such metaphysics are\ncorrect and wonder what would be the case according to them:\nsituations at which there is only one substance, or at which the\nAbsolute Geist necessarily shapes the teleological\ndevelopment of history. These situations will be, under the hypotheses\nwe have made, impossible worlds. \nSemantic structures for counterfactual conditionals involving\nimpossible worlds were first introduced by Routley 1989, and have been\nproposed e.g. by Read 1995, Mares & Fuhrmann 1995, Mares 1997,\nNolan 1997, Brogaard & Salerno 2013, Bjerring 2014, Berto et al.\n2018. Most of these are natural extensions of Lewis’s 1973 semantics\nfor counterfactuals and capture several intuitions about\ncounterpossible reasoning. The main task for such theories consists in\naccounting for the concepts of closeness and qualitative similarity\nbetween worlds once impossible worlds enter the stage. How to\nfine-tune these notions is not a trivial matter (for an extensive\ndiscussion, see Vander Laan 2004; we will say more in\n section 4.2). \nNon-trivial treatments of counterpossibles require the failure of\nseveral logical principles which hold in the standard Lewis-Stalnaker\napproach to counterfactuals (Williamson 2007 chapter 5, Brogaard &\nSalerno 2013). (Williamson uses these failures to argue that\ncounterpossibles are always trivially true.) One important principle\nthat fails is the entailment from a strict conditional, “if\n\\(A\\) then-strictly \\(B\\)”, to the corresponding\ncounterfactual, “if it were the case that \\(A\\) then it\nwould be the case that \\(B\\)”. Normally, the former entails\nthe latter. A strict conditional is true when all the (accessible)\npossible worlds where the antecedent is true also make the consequent\ntrue. If all the possible \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds,\nthen in particular all the closest possible \\(A\\)-worlds are\n\\(B\\)-worlds. In an account which admits impossible worlds,\nhowever, we can have closest impossible worlds where \\(A\\)\nobtains and \\(B\\) fails, making the counterpossible false even\nthough the corresponding strict conditional is true. \nThe ensuing anarchy can be mitigated to some extent, e.g., by assuming\nwhat Nolan 1997 calls the Strangeness of Impossibility\nCondition (SIC): any possible world, however weird, should be\ncloser to any possible world \\(w\\) than any impossible world is\nto \\(w\\). Reality will be turned upside down before logical laws\nor mathematical truths abandon us. Then it is plausible that the\nLewis-Stalnaker principles will still hold whenever the relevant\nantecedent is possible. For then we will consider only the\nclosest antecedent-worlds when we evaluate the conditional, all of\nwhich will be possible worlds: the impossible ones will be too far\naway (Berto et al. 2018). \nSupporters of impossible worlds disagree over their metaphysical\nnature, just as supporters of possible worlds do. If one accepts\nontological commitment to worlds of any kind, then one faces the\nfollow-up question: just what are they, metaphysically speaking?  \nThe two main options among modal realists (philosophers who\naccept possible worlds in their ontology) are David Lewis’s\nextreme or genuine modal realism and\nersatzism (or actualism or abstractionism:\nthese terms all have slightly different connotations, which we’ll\nignore here). It is a common thought among impossible worlds theorists\nthat impossible worlds should just inherit the ontological status of\ntheir possible mates: whatever your favorite metaphysics of possible\nworlds is, impossible worlds are of the same kind. This has been\ncalled the Parity Thesis (see Rescher & Brandom 1980). As\nGraham Priest puts it: \nYagisawa’s extended modal realism proposes a Lewis-inspired\nrealist account of impossible worlds and impossibilia (the\nobjects exemplifying absolute impossibilities which inhabit impossible\nworlds). On this view, impossible worlds are concrete mereological\nsums of real individuals, which are causally and spatiotemporally\ninterrelated within each world but never across worlds (see Yagisawa\n1988). Yagisawa exploits the “argument from ways” we met\nabove: if quantification on ways the world might be or have been\ncommits us to possible worlds, then, by parity of reasoning,\nquantification on ways the world might not be commits us to impossible\nworlds. The argument is backed by Yagisawa’s considerations on the\nadditional logical and philosophical applications allowed by\nimpossible worlds, which are not available, in his view, to\ntraditional Lewisian modal realism. Extended modal realism is a strong\nposition: concrete impossible worlds represent absolute and logical\nimpossibilities directly, by instantiating them. So\nimpossibilities and, in particular, logical inconsistencies, are\n“out there” in reality. \nIn his 2010 book, Yagisawa is more distant from Lewisian modal\nrealism. He still admits impossible worlds and impossibilia,\nand he rejects ersatz accounts of them. However, he now takes worlds\nto be points in modal space. Worlds are modal indices for truth, just\nlike times are temporal indices for it; and modal matters are treated\nin a way similar to how four-dimensionalist philosophers, who believe\nin\n temporal parts,\n treat temporal matters. According to four-dimensionalists, material\nobjects are like temporal worms extended across time: an object has a\nproperty at time \\(t\\) by having a temporal stage at time\n\\(t\\) which has that property. Analogously, for Yagisawa an\nobject has a modal property, a property at world \\(w\\), by having\na modal stage at world \\(w\\) which has that property. \nMore moderate (Yagisawa would say: too moderate) realists\ntreat impossible worlds as ersatz constructions: abstract\nentities on a par with ersatz possible worlds (see e.g. Mares 1997,\nVander Laan 1997). Modal ersatzism comes in various shapes (Divers\n2002, Part III, is by far the best critical evaluation in the\nliterature). If one takes possible worlds as maximally consistent sets\nof propositions (as per Adams 1974), impossible worlds could be sets\nof propositions that are inconsistent and/or incomplete. Similarly,\nPlantingan ersatzism (possible worlds are particular states of\naffairs) or Stalnakerian ersatzism (possible worlds are world-natures\nor maximal properties) could be easily extended to accommodate\nimpossible worlds. All hands agree that such worlds come at no great\nontological or theoretical cost, once one has accepted ersatz possible\nworlds. After all, ersatz worlds are abstract: they account for\nimpossibilities, not by instantiating them as Lewisian worlds do, but\nby representing them in some way or other. Jago (2012) takes both\npossible and impossible worlds to be constructions out of positive and\nnegative facts, such as Barack Obama’s not being French (see the entry\non\n facts). \nThe extension of ersatzism from possible to impossible worlds appears\nto be particularly straightforward for linguistic ersatzism.\nOn this approach, possible worlds are world-books: sets of\nsentences of a special “worldmaking” language. (Carnap’s\n(1947) state-descriptions and Jeffrey’s (1983) complete consistent\nnovels are examples of this strategy.) It is easy to admit impossible\nworlds of the same kind, that is, world-books which are locally\ninconsistent or incomplete, which fail to comply with some logical law\nor to be closed under some notion or other of logical consequence. \nHowever, there may be reasons to reject the Parity Thesis. If Lewis’s\ncriticisms of ersatzism in On the Plurality of Worlds are\nright, then each ersatz account of impossible worlds inherits the\nlimits of ersatz theories of possible worlds: each of these theories\nhas to resort to intensional entities taken as primitive (such as\npropositions or states of affairs) in its explanation of what ersatz\nworlds are, or to primitive modal notions (most often, to both).\nSuppose that, instead, one wants to retain the advantages of both\nworlds (no pun intended), ersatz and genuine, when it comes to\nimpossibilities. Suppose, that is, that (a) one wants to employ a\nmodal framework including both possible and impossible worlds to\nretain the theoretical benefits provided by the latter; and (b) one\nwants to stick to Lewis’s project of a reductive account of\nintensional and modal notions to fully extensional ones\n(contra ersatzism); but also (c) one wants to avoid the\nunwelcome consequences of concrete impossible worlds instantiating\nimpossibilities, such as having true contradictions “out\nthere” in reality (contra Yagisawa’s extended modal\nrealism). One could then try the following hybrid solution: (1) go\nrealist about possible worlds, and (2) exploit the set-theoretic\nmachinery of modal realism to represent different impossible worlds as\ndistinct ersatz, abstract constructions. \nTo fulfil these desiderata, Berto 2010 sketches an intermediate\naccount, labeled as Hybrid Modal Realism (HMR), which\ndispenses with the Parity Thesis. The account follows suggestions from\nDivers 2002, Chapter 5, and is similar to a strategy pursued in\nKiourti 2010, Chapter 3. On this view, genuine, concrete possible\nworlds are the basic stuff. Atomic propositions are taken as sets of\npossible worlds. Distinct impossible situations can then be\nrepresented by distinct world-books, taken as set-theoretic\nconstructions from atomic propositions. Krakauer 2013 gives a similar\naccount in terms of\n structured propositions\n built out of ordinary possible worlds. Jago 2012 and Sendłak\n2015 criticise Berto’s approach on the basis that it cannot\ndistinguish the proposition that Hesperus is the second planet\nfrom the sun from the proposition that Phosphorus is the\nsecond planet from the sun. Reinert 2018 attempts to do better by\ncombining Lewisian possible worlds with an ersatz situation-based\naccount of impossible worlds. \nA metaphysical account of impossible worlds, alternative both to\nersatzism and to Lewisian realism, has been proposed in Zalta 1997.\nZalta’s powerful theory of abstract objects is based upon his logic of\nencoding, whose core idea consists in postulating an\nambiguity in the copula of predication: “\\(x\\) is\n\\(P\\)” can mean that object \\(x\\) exemplifies property\n\\(P\\), as per ordinary predication; but it may also mean that\n\\(x\\) encodes \\(P\\), encoding being a special mode of\npredication. An object which encodes a property is determined by it,\nbut without instantiating or exemplifying it. Abstract objects encode\nproperties, besides exemplifying them; in particular, they can encode\nproperties they do not exemplify (see Zalta 1983). Within this theory,\nsituations are defined as abstract objects that encode states\nof affairs (taken as 0-ary properties); and impossible worlds are\ntaken as maximal situations that are not possible, that is, such that\nit is not possible that all the states of affairs encoded by them\nsimultaneously obtain. \nZalta claims that, despite treating worlds as abstract objects, this\nis not an ersatz conception of worlds. A given state of affairs\n\\(p\\)’s obtaining at world \\(w\\) (no matter whether\n\\(w\\) is possible or impossible) is analyzed as: \nand so being-such-that-p is ascribed, in the encoding sense,\nto \\(w\\). As such, \\(w\\) is (in the encoding sense\nof the copula, at least) such that \\(p\\). Thus, according to\nZalta’s theory of encoding, worlds are in some sense metaphysically\ncharacterized or determined by such states of affairs. And according\nto Zalta nothing of the sort can be claimed of ersatz conceptions of\nworlds. \nAll the ontological accounts of impossible worlds presented so far are\nin a broad sense realist. They all accept that sentences referring to\nor quantifying over impossible worlds can be literally true, and take\nthe entailed ontological commitment at face value, although they\ndisagree with each other about the metaphysical status of worlds. A\ndeeply anti-realist alternative to modal metaphysics has also been\ndeveloped:\n modal fictionalism.\n The view is fictionalist (or anti-realist) about worlds. Its\nkey claim is that talk of and quantification over worlds ought to be\nunderstood as literally false: it is only true within a “worlds\nfiction”. We make-believe in the fiction because it delivers\nuseful results in the explanation of modal notions. Modal fictionalism\npromises the theoretical benefits of modal realism without the\nontological costs. We should not include worlds (other than the actual\nworld) in our ontological catalogue. But talking as if there\nwere worlds is useful. Gideon Rosen (1990), a major proponent of the\nview, takes Lewisian modal realism to be the relevant fiction. But it\nis relatively easy to extend such modal fictionalist accounts into\nfictional treatments of possible and impossible worlds,\ntaking e.g. Yagisawa’s extended modal realism as the fiction which we\nmake-believe. JC Beall (2008) proposes an approach to\nimpossible worlds (see\n section 5.1),\n which can be motivated by the idea that these are worlds where\n“logical fictions” take place. \nAnother issue which theories of impossible worlds disagree on concerns\nthe amount of logical structure such worlds have. This issue\naffects impossible worlds specifically: there is no correlative issue\nconcerning possible worlds (beyond our choice of logic). Various\nclasses of impossible worlds display different degrees of anarchic\nlogical behavior: as we shall see, non-normal worlds for non-normal modal logics\n (section 5.1),\n for instance, are such that only modal sentences behave in a\nnon-standard fashion at them, whereas sentences that include just the\nBoolean operators of classical logic get the standard treatment. Such\nworlds appear to be logically more structured than fully anarchic\n“open” worlds\n (section 5.3).\nFor, we shall see, even principles of classical logic involving only\nthe extensional, truth-functional connectives can fail at open worlds:\ntheir openness consists in their not being closed under any\nnon-trivial logical consequence principle. \nShould we require impossible worlds to comply with any\nlogical rules? And if we allow different classes of impossible worlds,\neach exhibiting different degrees of logical structure, can these\nclasses be ordered in a meaningful way? This section focuses on these\ntwo issues. \nAre there any logical principles which impossible worlds must obey?\nMore precisely, is there any logical inference such that, for any\n(impossible) world \\(w\\), if the premises are all true according\nto \\(w\\), then so is the conclusion? There is at least one such\ninference: the trivial inference from \\(A\\) to \\(A\\). (For\nif \\(A\\) is true at world \\(w\\), then \\(A\\) is true at\nworld \\(w\\)!) Are there any others? This is the granularity\nissue. \nIn addressing the issue, a good starting place is Nolan’s\nPrinciple (Nolan 1997: 542): \n(This is not an ‘if and only if’, since the converse is\nclearly false: some impossible world represents your reading this\narticle, yet that’s not at all impossible. Impossible worlds\nrepresent possible and impossible situations. The things they\nrepresent make for an impossible bunch, but might each be possible\nwhen taken individually.) \nThe principle has some intuitive force. Nolan thinks of it as a kind\nof unrestricted ‘comprehension principle’ for\nimpossibilities. It tells something about which impossible worlds\nthere are. There will be worlds which represent that water is not\nH\\(_2\\)O, that \\(2+2=5\\), and that snow both is and is not white.\nOne might think that (NP) entails that ‘anything goes’\nwith regard to impossible worlds: that any logical principle (except\n\\(A \\vDash A)\\) will be broken by some impossible\nworld. If so, then (NP) delivers the open worlds mentioned above.\nHowever, to apply (NP), we need a single object-language sentence\n\\(A\\) which describes an impossibility. Logical laws, by\ncontrast, are stated as relationships between multiple\nobject-language sentences. So it is not clear that (NP) does its\nintended work. \nPriest (2016) adopts two principles that are similar to, but stronger\nthan, (NP): ‘everything holds at some worlds, and everything\nfails at some worlds’ (Priest 2016, 5) and, for any distinct\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), ‘there are worlds where \\(A\\) holds and \\(B\\)\nfails’ (Priest 2016, 7). More specifically, in our terminology:\n \nPriest calls these the ‘primary directive’ and\n‘secondary directive’ on impossible worlds, respectively.\nThe latter implies the former, which in turn implies (NP), but neither\nconverse holds.  \nTo illustrate the extra power (4.2) gives us (over (4.1) and (NP)),\nconsider Simplification, the inference from \\(A \\wedge B\\) to\n\\(A\\), or Disjunction Introduction, from \\(A\\) to \\(A \\vee\nB\\). (4.2) directly entails that there are worlds where these rules\nfail. So, if we find (4.2) plausible, we can infer that impossible\nworlds are not, in general, governed by standard\n paraconsistent logics. \nA paraconsistent logic is any one in which cont radictory\npremises \\(A\\), \\(\\neg A\\) do not entail arbitrary\nconclusions. But standardly, paraconsistent logics maintain the\nprinciple that conjunctions are true just in case both conjuncts are;\ndisjunctions are true just in case at least one disjunct is; and\ndouble negations \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) are true just in case \\(A\\)\nis. If we accept (4.2), then these relationships will break down in\nsome impossible worlds. \nYet even with (4.2) in play, it doesn’t follow that\n‘anything goes’ with impossible worlds. No principle so\nfar entails that some impossible world breaks the Adjunction rule,\nfrom \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to \\(A \\wedge B\\), simply\nbecause 4.2 doesn’t apply to inferences with multiple premises.\n(We discuss Adjunction-violating worlds further in\n section 5.2\n below.) To infer the ‘anything goes’ conclusion, that for\nany logically valid inference there is some impossible world that\nbreaks it, we’ll need this principle: \nHowever, we can hardly claim that we’ve derived the\n‘anything goes’ picture of impossible worlds from this\nprinciple, for it is, in effect, an explicit statement of that very\nview. Whilst the original (NP) has a good deal of intuitive force,\nit’s much harder to feel that way about (NP\\(^+)\\). \nThere may be no completely general, intuitively motivated principle\n(along the lines of (NP)) from which we can ascertain just how\nfine-grained impossible worlds should be. Nevertheless, there are\narguments which support the ‘anything goes’ picture, on\nwhich there exist open worlds (those closed under no valid inferences\nexcept \\(A \\vDash A)\\). We’ll briefly consider\nthree such arguments. \nThe first is simple. If impossible worlds can break some logical rule,\nthen why can’t they break all of them? Suppose we fix on\nstandard proof rules for the connectives. Each such rule is as closely\ntied to the meaning of the associated connective as the others are (to\ntheir associated connectives). Yet, as each logically impossible world\nbreaks at least one of those rules, what’s to stop some other\nimpossible world from breaking any of the other rules? This argument\nhas some intuitive force, but is clearly far from conclusive. \nThe second argument is from epistemic states. When we consider\nreal-world finite and fallible epistemic agents, there seem to be no\nrules of the form: if someone believes \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\), then they\nmust believe (distinct) \\(B\\) (that’s why the logical\nomniscience problem discussed in 2.3 is hard!). If we model their\nepistemic states in terms of worlds, then at least one of the worlds\nmust break the inference from \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) to \\(B.\\) So each\nlogical inference (except \\(A \\vDash A)\\) is broken by some world\n(Jago 2014a; Priest 2016). \nThe third argument is from counterpossible reasoning. Suppose, in a\nclass on alternative logics, we consider what would happen if Excluded\nMiddle \\((\\vDash A \\vee \\neg A)\\), Double-Negation Elimination \\((\\neg\n\\neg A \\vDash A)\\), or the Law of Explosion \\((A, \\neg A \\vDash B)\\)\nwere to fail. If classical logic is the one true logic, and logical\nnecessity is absolute, we’re then reasoning counterpossibly. If\nwe want to analyse counterpossibles in general using impossible\nworlds, then we’ll need worlds where these principles fail. But\nwe seem to be able to reason this way, non-trivially, for any kind of\nlogical principle, and so our analysis will require open worlds\n(Priest 2016). \nWhy have we spared \\(A \\vDash A\\) so far? Well, it\nseems that in order to break this, an impossible world would\nsimultaneously have to represent that \\(A\\) and not represent\nthat \\(A\\). Such a world would itself be an impossible object,\none with inconsistent features. Since most impossible worlds theorists\nmaintain that impossible worlds (actually) exist and that actuality is\nnot inconsistent, this position is ruled out. It is available to\ndialethists and others who allow reality to have inconsistent\nfeatures. There seems to be no theoretical cost in requiring\n\\(A \\vDash A\\) to hold at all worlds (impossible or\notherwise). Going back to epistemic states, for example, we want to\nrepresent inconsistent beliefs, such as someone’s believing both that\n\\(A\\) and that \\(\\neg A\\) at the same time; but it would be\na mistake to infer that she both believes and does not believe that\n\\(A\\). \nIf impossible worlds display different degrees of logical structure\n(or lack thereof), it may make sense to order them. A natural way to\ndo this is via an extension of the traditional “closeness”\nrelations between possible worlds. How to spell out the ordering in\ndetail, though, is far from straightforward. Within standard\nconditional logics, and in the treatment of counterfactual\nconditionals in terms of possible worlds due to Robert Stalnaker\n(1968) and David Lewis (1973), worlds stand in similarity relations;\nand similarity comes in degrees. This is usually represented by having\neach possible world, \\(w\\), come with a system of\n“spheres”. If \\(W\\) is the set of all worlds, let \\(\\$\\) be a\nfunction from worlds to sets of subsets of \\(W\\), so that \\(\\$w =\n\\{S_1, S_2 , \\ldots \\}\\), with \\(w \\in S_1 \\subseteq S_2 \\subseteq\n\\ldots = W\\). Worlds within a given sphere \\(S_i\\) are more similar to\n\\(w\\) than worlds outside it. \nIf we take the special case in which \\(w =\\) the actual world\n(call it “@”), we get a natural arrangement of possible\nworlds in a system of spheres that mirrors their degree of\n(dis)similarity with respect to @, according to the different kinds of\npossibilities and (relative) impossibilities they represent. For\ninstance, a world which is exactly like @, except that Franz wears a\nwhite t-shirt instead of the black one he’s actually wearing while\nwriting these lines, is, intuitively, closer to @ than a world at\nwhich the laws of physics are turned upside down. Some people have a\ngeneral, intuitive depiction of such closeness relations, and set out\na hierarchy of modalities accordingly: possible worlds where the laws\nof physics are different from ours are naturally seen as more\neccentric than worlds where only biological, but not physical, laws\nare different; and these are more eccentric than possible worlds with\nminimal factual changes with respect to @, such as the white t-shirt\nworld. \nCan such a natural view be extended to impossible worlds? First, it is\nintuitive to claim that some impossible worlds are more similar to the\nactual world @ than others. For instance, the “explosion”\nworld (call it \\(e)\\) at which everything is the case (every\nsentence is true) seems to be as far from @ as one can imagine, if one\ncan actually imagine or conceive such an extremely absurd situation.\nNow, pick the impossible world, \\(t\\), at which everything is as\nin @, except that Franz wears an impossible t-shirt which is white all\nover and black all over. Intuitively, \\(t\\) is closer to @ than\n\\(e\\). \nNext, some authors (e.g. Mares 1997) favor Nolan’s SIC principle\n(introduced in\n section 2.5).\n This implies that any possible world is closer to @ than any\nimpossible world is to @. A system of spheres for impossible worlds\ncentered on @ will just extend the intuitive possible worlds spheres\ndescribed above, by adding further, larger spheres where worlds\noutside (logical, or more generally unrestricted) possibility stand.\nBut how are these latter to be internally ordered? \nOne very general option is the following. Even though we subscribe to\nsome unrestricted comprehension principle for impossible worlds, we\nmay admit that worlds where only the intensional operators, e.g., the\nbox and diamond of necessity and possibility, behave in a non-standard\nfashion are less deviant than worlds where also the extensional\noperators, like classical conjunction and disjunction, do. Let us call\nworlds of the former kind intensionally impossible and worlds\nof the latter kind\nextensionally impossible. This picture (inspired by Priest\n2005, Chapter 1) has some intuitive force to recommend it. Kripkean\nnon-normal worlds, where only the behaviour of the modal operators is\nnon-standard (see\n section 5.1),\n are intuitively less deviant than open worlds, where all formulas may\nbehave arbitrarily. Generalizing, the view would entail arranging the\nrespective spheres in such a way that any intensionally impossible\nworld is closer to @ than any extensionally impossible one. \nThis very general ordering of impossibilities, albeit intuitive, may\nnot be fully satisfying. A general qualm concerns the SIC principle\nitself. For one may claim that, intuitively, some slightly deviant\nimpossible worlds may be more similar to the actual world @\nthan some possible but very weird worlds. For instance, the impossible\nworld \\(t\\) above, which is like @ except for Franz’s wearing an\ninconsistent T-shirt, may look more familiar than a world which is\nlogically possible, but where the laws of physics are turned upside\ndown. Several authors (Nolan 1997, Vander Laan 2004, Bernstein 2016)\nhave proposed putative counterexamples to SIC along these lines. \nAlthough we cannot pursue this topic further within the limits of this\nentry, the discussion developed so far should show that the issue of\nthe structure, closeness, and ordering of impossible worlds is quite\nopen. \nThis section is a bit more technical than the others. None\nof the other sections presuppose this material. \n\n Possible worlds semantics\n is celebrated for providing suitable interpretations for different\naxiomatic systems of\n modal logic,\n such as\n C.I. Lewis’s\n systems \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\). In each model, sentences are\nevaluated as true or false relative to a possible world. Modal\nsentences \\(\\Box A\\) and \\(\\Diamond A\\) (usually read as\n‘it is necessary that \\(A\\)’ and ‘it is\npossible that \\(A\\)’, respectively) are evaluated in terms\nof \\(A\\)’s truth at all or some of the accessible\nworlds. By placing various conditions on the accessibility relation\nbetween worlds, different modal logics can be accommodated. (Readers\nunfamiliar with modal logic are advised again to read the entities on\n possible worlds\n and\n modal logic\n before going further in this section.) \nThis approach validates the Necessitation inference rule: \nIf \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(\\Box A\\). (In symbols: if\n\\(\\vDash A\\) then \\(\\vDash \\Box A\\).)\n \nTo see why, suppose \\(A\\) is a logical truth. Then in any model,\nit is true at all possible worlds. So given any world \\(w\\) in an\narbitrary model, \\(A\\) is true at all worlds accessible from\n\\(w\\), hence \\(\\Box A\\) is true at \\(w\\), and so\n\\(\\Box A\\) too is valid. \nLogics in which the Necessitation rule is valid are called normal\nmodal logics. But historically, not all of the modal logics of\ninterest are normal logics. C.I. Lewis’s systems \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S3}\\) are non-normal logics, for example. These logics are\nweaker than normal modal logics, in the sense that they\nsupport fewer valid inferences. To give a worlds-based semantics for\nsuch logics, we need to look beyond possible worlds. \nIn 1965, Saul Kripke introduced a special kind of world, the\nnon-normal worlds, in order to provide semantics for\nnon-normal modal logics. Let us introduce some simple semantic\nmachinery for propositional modal logic. Take a non-normal\ninterpretation of a propositional modal language, \\(\\langle W, N, R,\nv\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds; \\(N\\) is a proper subset\nof \\(W\\), the set of normal worlds; \\(R\\) is a binary\naccessibility relation between worlds; and \\(v\\) is a valuation\nfunction assigning truth values to formulas at worlds:\n“\\(v_w(A)\\)” denotes the truth value of \\(A\\) at world\n\\(w\\). Worlds in \\(W - N\\) are the non-normal worlds. The truth\nconditions for the extensional logical vocabulary (negation,\nconjunction, disjunction, the material conditional) are given the\nusual way. The same holds for the modal operators of necessity\n\\(\\Box\\) and possibility \\(\\Diamond\\), but only at normal\nworlds. If \\(w\\) is non-normal, the truth conditions for the\nmodalizers go as follows: \nwhere 1 stands for true, 0 for false. At non-normal\nworlds, formulas of the form £\\(A\\), with £ a modal,\nare not evaluated depending on the truth value of \\(A\\) at other\n(accessible) worlds, but get assigned their truth value directly: all\nbox-formulas are false and all diamond-formulas are true. In a sense,\nat non-normal worlds nothing is necessary, and anything is possible.\nThese worlds, however, are deviant only in this respect: their\nbehavior, as far as the extensional connectives are concerned, is\nquite regular. \nIn some (though not all) worlds semantics, logical validity and\nconsequence are defined relative to just the normal worlds.\nThe idea is that the normal worlds behave ‘appropriately’\nwith respect to the logic in question, whereas the non-normal worlds\ndo not. For example, \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A\\) is valid\nin \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\), but (by definition) it is false at the\nnon-normal worlds. So we need to ignore the non-normal worlds when\ndefining validity and consequence, which we do as follows: \n\\(A\\) is valid \\((\\vDash A)\\) if and only if, for\nall normal worlds \\(w\\) in all models, \\(v_w (A) = 1\\). \nPremises \\(S\\) entail \\(A (S \\vDash A)\\) if and only if, for\nall normal worlds \\(w\\) in all models: if \\(v_w (B) = 1\\) for\nall premises \\(B \\in\\) S, then \\(v_w (A) = 1\\). \nEven though we have ignored the non-normal worlds in this definition,\nthey still play a role in invalidating Necessitation. For take any\nclassical propositional tautology, say \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\). This holds\nat all worlds of all models, so \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds at all\nnormal worlds and hence is valid. But \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds at\nno non-normal world. Now suppose \\(w\\) is a normal world that has\naccess to any non-normal world. Then \\(\\Box \\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) is\nfalse at \\(w\\) and so (since \\(w\\) is normal) \\(\\Box \\Box(A \\vee \\neg\nA)\\) is not valid. That’s a counterexample to Necessitation. \nIn these semantics for non-normal modal logics such as \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S3}\\), the valuation function assigns the same truth value to all\nbox formulas (false) and all diamond formulas (true) at non-normal\nworlds. But we can do things differently. In Cresswell’s (1966)\nsemantics for the modal system S0.5 (due to E.J. Lemmon\n(1957)), sentences beginning with a modality are assigned\narbitrary truth values. The valuation function \\(v\\) treats\nmodal sentences as if they were atomic sentences.  (Interpretations\nfor \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\) are thus special cases of the\ninterpretations for S0.5.) The idea of considering\nimpossible (non-normal) worlds as worlds at which complex formulas are\ntreated as atomic one is a popular one, as we will see below. \nKripke introduced non-normal worlds as a technical device in order to\ntreat C.I. Lewis’ non-normal modal logics; the question of the\ninterpretation of such structures (particularly, of the\nontological status of impossible worlds), then, makes perfect sense\n— and the answer is not straightforward, as have seen in\n section 3. \nIn 1980, Nicholas Rescher and Robert Brandom published The Logic\nof Inconsistency. A Study in Non-Standard Possible-Worlds Semantics\nand Ontology. They introduced a modal semantics including,\nbesides ordinary possible worlds (taken as maximally consistent\ncollections of states of affairs), also non-standard worlds that are\nlocally inconsistent (such that, for some \\(A\\), both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg\nA\\) hold at them), and incomplete (such that for some \\(A\\), neither\n\\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold at them).  These are obtained\ncombinatorially, via two recursive operations having standard worlds\nas their base, and called schematization \\((\\cap)\\)\nand superposition \\((\\cup)\\).  Given two worlds \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(w_2\\), a schematic world \\(w_1 \\cap w_2\\) is one at which all and\nonly the states of affairs obtain, which obtain both at \\(w_1\\) and at\n\\(w_2\\). Dually, a “superposed” or inconsistent world\n\\(w_1 \\cup w_2\\) is one at which all and only the states of affairs\nobtain, which obtain at \\(w_1\\) or at \\(w_2\\). Rescher and\nBrandom’s inconsistent-superposed worlds are, therefore,\nimpossible worlds of the fourth kind: Contradiction Realizers making\nboth \\(A\\) and its negation true, for some \\(A\\) (just superpose, for\ninstance, a possible world, \\(w_1\\), at which I am 1.70m tall, and\nanother possible world, \\(w_2\\), at which I am 1.90m tall). \nThe assignment of truth values at such worlds is not (obviously)\ncompositional with respect to conjunction. The standard semantic\nclause interprets the ‘\\(\\wedge\\)’ symbol using our world\n‘and’: \nBut the right-to-left direction will have to go, if \\(w\\) is one\nof Rescher and Brandom’s impossible worlds. These worlds are\nnonadjunctive: they allow two sentences to be true even\nthough their conjunction is not true. (Adjunction is the\nprinciple that the truth of a conjunction follows from the truth of\nits conjuncts.) Rescher and Brandom’s worlds can also be\nnonprime: a disjunction may hold at them even though neither\ndisjunct does. They may also make some \\(A\\) and its negation\n\\(\\neg A\\) both true. But the corresponding conjunction,\n\\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\), doesn’t follow. These impossible\nworlds retain a certain amount of logical structure. They are closed\nunder any classically valid, essentially single-premised inference\n(such as Disjunction Introduction); but they are not closed\nunder essentially multiple-premised inferences (such as\nAdjunction). \nRescher and Brandom’s approach falls in the nonadjunctive tradition\n(see Berto 2007, Chapter 6) of\n paraconsistent logics:\n a tradition started by Jaskowksi’s discussive logic\n\\(\\mathbf{D}_2\\) (also labeled as \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) in the literature), and\nbased on the idea of rejecting or limiting the Adjunction principle.\nSuch an approach has been revived in works by Hyde (1997), and Varzi\n(1997 and 2004). \nTo model a concept such as knowledge, we can use a modality\n‘\\(K\\)’ for ‘knows that’, with semantics\nalong the lines of ‘\\(\\Box\\)’, quantifying over all\nepistemically possible worlds: worlds which are ways things could be,\nfor all one knows, or given the information or evidence one has\navailable. This is epistemic modal logic. (See the entry on\n epistemic logic\n for background material.) \nThis approach has proved to be very useful. However, when\nepistemically possible worlds confirm to the rules of logically\npossible worlds, the following principle is valid: \n(Closure) If \\(KA\\) and \\(A\\) entails \\(B\\), then \\(KB\\)\n \nThis principle says that one knows all the logical consequences of the\nthings one knows. A special case of this principle says that all valid\nformulas are known: \n(Validity) If \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(KA\\)\n \nBut these principles seem false. You don’t know all the logical and\nmathematical truths, and there are truths which follow from what you\nknow which you don’t know. (You might be indifferent to those truths;\nyou might even disbelieve them.) This is the problem of logical\nomniscience (see\n epistemic logic\n again). There is a rich literature on the problem (Alechina et al.\n2004, Duc 1997, Hintikka 1975, Jago 2014a,b, Rantala 1982a), including\nsome who defend these seemingly false principles (Stalnaker 1991,\n1999). \nExactly the same holds for belief (treated with a modality\n‘\\(B\\)’ along the lines of ‘\\(K\\)’).\nThe modal epistemic approach tells us that, as well as believing all\nconsequences of what we believe, we must hold a perfectly consistent\nset of beliefs: \n(Consistency) \\(\\vDash \\neg(BA \\wedge B\\neg A)\\).\n \nThis is a hard principle to defend, as anyone who has reflected on\ntheir own beliefs will appreciate. \nA popular method of avoiding these principles (beginning with\nCresswell 1973 and Hintikka 1975) is to allow impossible worlds into\nthe account. Consider again Rescher and Brandom’s nonadjunctive and\nnonprime worlds, at which conjunction and disjunction behave\nanarchically. Rantala (1982a) takes the idea further, introducing\nworlds at which any connective may behave anarchically. \nRantala’s approach divides the worlds into normal and\nnon-normal ones. Normal worlds behave like possible worlds\nwhereas at non-normal worlds, every sentence is assigned an\narbitrary truth value. In effect, complex sentences \\(\\neg A, A \\vee\nB\\), and so on, are treated as if they were atomic sentences. The\ntruth value of \\(\\neg A\\) is independent of \\(A\\); the value of \\(A\n\\vee B\\) is independent of the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at a\nnon-normal world; and so on for the other complex sentences. These\nnon-normal worlds are thus a very anarchic form of impossible\nworld. Priest (2005, 2016) calls them\nopen worlds, since they are not closed under any rule of\ninference (other than the trivial rule allowing one to infer\n\\(A\\) from \\(A\\); see also Jago 2014a). \nLogical consequence and validity are defined with respect to possible\n(normal) worlds only. Impossible worlds come into play only when\nevaluating knowledge claims, \\(KA\\). So, ignoring\n\\(K\\)-sentences, the logic is classical. But the logic of\n\\(K\\)-sentences is not closed under any non-trivial rule of\ninference, thereby dispensing with Closure, Validity, and (in the case\nof belief) Consistency. An agent is modelled as having inconsistent\nbeliefs, for example, simply by treating an impossible world where\nboth \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true as being epistemically\naccessible (from the actual world) for that agent. \nThe approach has been generalized to quantified modal logics (Rantala\n1982b) and developed into a unified framework for epistemic logics\n(Wansing 1989, 1990). Wansing has shown that various logics for\nknowledge and belief developed in Artificial Intelligence can find\nequivalent models in structures including impossible worlds. Further\nequivalence results in this area have been obtained in Sillari 2008,\nwhere it is shown that impossible worlds structures using binary\nepistemic accessibility relations are equivalent to structures using\nMontague-Scott neighborhood semantics. \nThis kind of approach faces problems, however. If there’s no logical\nstructure to impossible worlds, then we might do as well to model an\nagent’s knowledge using an arbitrary set of sentences, as in Konolige\n1986. The worry is that unconstrained impossible worlds semantics\nmakes no real progress over this purely syntactic approach (Jago 2007,\n2009). \nOne may instead adopt impossible worlds that retain some\nlogical structure, e.g., worlds closed under some\nweaker-than-classical logical consequence. One approach of this kind\nis found in Levesque 1984 (see also Cresswell 1973). This employs\nimpossible worlds of the kind used in paraconsistent relevant logics,\nwhich can be locally inconsistent and incomplete but are well-behaved\nwith respect to conjunction and disjunction, that is, they are\nadjunctive and prime. Laws of classical logic fail at them, and by\naccessing them a cognitive agent can have inconsistent beliefs.\nHowever, we still have a weakened form of logical omniscience: the\nbeliefs of an agent are closed under the weaker\nparaconsistent-relevant logic at issue. This seems incorrect as an\nattempt to model finite agents. \nRasmussen 2015 and Bjerring and Skipper (forthcoming) present a\ndynamic impossible worlds solution to the logical omniscience\nproblem. Agents’ beliefs evolve over time due to epistemic\nactions, on this approach (see the entry on\n dynamic epistemic logic\n for background). Bjerring and Skipper focus on deductive\nactions. Agents count as competent insofar as they unfold the\nconsequences of their beliefs, up to a certain depth of reasoning.\nTheir operator “\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\)”, says:\n“After some \\(n\\)-step chain of logical reasoning, the agent\ncomes to know that \\(A\\)”. The agent can update its epistemic\nstate by kicking out choices of impossible worlds which were epistemic\npossibilities before the deduction took place. One can show that if a\nformula \\(A\\) follows from formulas \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) in \\(n\\)\nsteps of reasoning, then \\(KA_1, \\ldots, KA_n\\) together entail\n\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\). \n\n Relevance logic\n (or relevant logic) is an attempt to capture the idea that good\nreasoning requires a genuine condition between premises and\nconclusions. This should go beyond a mere guarantee of truth\npreservation. For when a conclusion \\(A\\) is guaranteed to be\ntrue (for example, when it is a logical truth), any argument\nconcluding in \\(A\\) will preserve truth from premises to\nconclusions. But those premises may have no genuine connection\nwhatsoever to what \\(A\\) is about. The same consideration applies\nwhen taking a conditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) to be valid:\nthere should be a genuine connection between \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\). \nWith this in mind, relevance logic attempts to avoid the\n‘fallacies of relevance’ (also called ‘paradoxes of\nthe material conditional’). These are conditionals that are\nvalid in classical and modal logic, simply because the antecedent is a\nnecessary falsehood or the consequent is a necessary truth, but\nwithout a guarantee of any real connection between them. Examples\ninclude \\(A \\wedge \\neg A \\rightarrow B\\) (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet, or the Law of Explosion), \\(A\n\\rightarrow B \\vee \\neg B\\), and \\(A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow B)\\)\n(verum ex quolibet). \nContradiction-realizing impossible worlds can help us avoid ex\ncontradictione quodlibet, if they are worlds where some\ncontradiction \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) is true but some other\n\\(B\\) is not true. For that reason, various systems of relevant\nlogic have been given semantics which include (things naturally\nthought of as) impossible worlds. \nA Routley-Meyer interpretation (see Routley & Routley\n1972; Routley & Meyer 1973, 1976; Routley 1979) for relevant\n(propositional) logics is a structure \\(\\langle W, N,\nR, {}^*, v\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds;\n\\(N\\) is a proper subset of \\(W\\) including the normal or\npossible worlds (the remaining worlds are the non-normal or impossible\nworlds); \\(R\\) is a ternary accessibility relation\nbetween worlds, and \\({}^*\\) (the Routley star) is a function from\nworlds to worlds. \\({}^*\\) and \\(R\\) figure prominently in the truth\nconditions for negation and the (relevant) conditional. Their task is\nprecisely to provide a semantics for negation that allows for the\ntruth of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) at some worlds, and a\nsemantics for the conditional that frees it from the fallacies of\nrelevance. \nIn order to get rid of such entailments as \\(A \\rightarrow \n(B \\rightarrow B)\\), we need some world at which \\(A\\)\nholds but \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) fails. One way to achieve this\nmay be to admit “partial” or incomplete situations of the\nkind studied in\n situation semantics,\n at which \\(A\\) holds but \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) fails to\nhold, just because they carry no information about \\(B\\). Another\nway is via impossible worlds: an understanding of such worlds, as we\nhave seen, is as scenarios where logical laws may fail, and the Law of\n(propositional) Identity, stating that any formula entails itself, is\none of them. At possible worlds, we still require for the truth of\nconditionals \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) that at every accessible\nworld where \\(A\\) holds, \\(B\\) holds, too. Consequently,\n\\(A \\rightarrow(B \\rightarrow B)\\) is not logically\nvalid. Technically, when \\(w\\) is an impossible world, we state\nthe truth conditions for the conditional, by means of the ternary\n\\(R\\), as follows: \nThe key difference between \\((\\rightarrow)\\) and the standard modal clause for\nthe strict conditional (which is true at a world if and only if, at\nall accessible worlds where the antecedent is true, the consequent is\ntrue), is that the worlds of the antecedent and the consequent have\nbeen “split”. Specifically, \\(B \\rightarrow B\\)\nfails at impossible worlds \\(w\\) when there are worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that\nR\\(ww_1 w_2, B\\)\nholds at the former, but fails at the latter. Since we do not want\n\\(B \\rightarrow B\\) to fail at normal/possible worlds, we can\nadd a Normality Condition, saying that the accessible worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) are one and the\nsame: \nUsing the ternary relation \\(R\\), one can build models for\ndifferent relevant logics. Starting with the basic relevant system\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), one obtains models for stronger logics such as \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), the\nsystem of relevant implication, by adding additional conditions on\n\\(R\\). (This is similar to the way we may move on from basic\nmodal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) to the systems \\(\\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{S4}\\), and\n\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), by adding extra conditions on the accessibility relation.)\nThe constraints to be added to the ternary \\(R\\) are more complex\nthan those of standard modal logic and some involve the star operator\n\\({}^*\\) (which we’ll address shortly). \nIt isn’t easy to provide an intuitive reading for the ternary relation\n\\(R\\). The basic idea is that the truth of an entailment\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) at a world \\(w\\) depends on\n\\(w\\)’s “seeing an accessibility” (Bremer 2005: 67)\nbetween two other worlds \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(w_2\\), such that if \\(A\\) is true at the former,\n\\(B\\) is true at the latter. But what does this mean? This is\nperhaps the most important philosophical issue facing semantics for\nrelevant logics. One approach is the information-based account of\nMares (2004, 2009, 2010) and (Restall 1995b), based on\n situation semantics.\n Another approach draws on various interpretations of\nconditionality, such as those found in the literature on\nconditional logics (Beall et al. 2012). (See the entry on\n relevance logic\n or Jago 2013c for further discussion.)  \nGiven a world \\(w\\), the Routley star function outputs a world\n\\(w^*\\) which is, in a sense, its “reverse twin”. The\ntruth conditions for negation within the Routley-Meyer semantics\nare: \nSo \\(\\neg A\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if and only if\n\\(A\\) is false, not at \\(w\\) itself (as it happens with\nstandard negation), but at its twin \\(w^*\\). Relevant negation is\ntherefore an intensional operator: in order to evaluate\nnegated sentences at \\(w\\), we may need to check the goings on at\nsome other world. \nAdding appropriate constraints provides this negation with many\nintuitive inferential features. If \\(w^{**} = w\\) for all\nworlds \\(w\\), for example, Double Negation introduction and\nelimination is valid. This is often called De Morgan\nnegation, for De Morgan’s Laws hold of it. But it does not validate\nthe Law of Explosion (that a contradiction entails any sentence). For\na counterexample, take a model where \\(A\\) holds at \\(w,\nB\\) doesn’t hold at \\(w\\), and \\(A\\) doesn’t hold at\n\\(w^*\\). Then, both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold at\n\\(w\\), whereas \\(B\\) doesn’t: \\(w\\) is an inconsistent\nbut non-trivial world. \nWhat is the intuitive connection between \\(w\\) and \\(w^*\\)?\nThe idea is that the twins are “mirror images one of the other\nreversing ‘in’ and ‘out’” (Dunn 1986:\n191). If \\(w\\) is \\(A\\)-inconsistent (both \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\) hold), then \\(w^*\\) is \\(A\\)-incomplete\n(neither \\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold), and vice versa. The \\({}^*\\)\ntakes local inconsistency into local incompleteness and vice versa. It\nmay also be the case that \\(w = w^*\\): the twins are in\nfact one. In that case, \\(w\\) must be a maximal and consistent\nworld, where negation behaves classically: \\(\\neg A\\) is true if\nand only if \\(A\\) is false there. \nThis last section discusses some difficulties for impossible worlds\ntheories.  \nSuppose that the expression ‘at world \\(w\\)’ works as\na restricting modifier: its main task consists in restricting the\nquantifiers within its scope to parts of \\(w\\) (Lewis 1986). If\nso, then it should distribute through the truth-functional\nconnectives. This means in particular that \nwill entail the contradiction  \nThis is the exportation principle. It is disastrous for any\ntheory of impossible worlds. It implies that an inconsistency at some\nimpossible world will spill over into an overt inconsistency. A true\ncontradiction at some \\(w\\) implies that there are true\ncontradictions, full stop. This is hard to swallow, unless one is a\ndialetheist. (And even\n dialethists\n may want to reject the exportation principle for impossible worlds:\nsee Jago 2013b.) \nAvoiding the exportation principle is not difficult, however (Kiourti\n2010, Chapter 4; Jago 2013b). For it to be valid, it seems to require\ngenuine worlds, as in Lewis’s (1986) genuine modal realism or\nYagisawa’s (1988, 2010) extended modal realism. Adopting an\nersatz conception of worlds blocks the principle. If a world\nrepresents that \\(A\\) (say, by containing a sentence or proposition\nexpressing that A), but is not in itself such that \\(A\\),\nthen the principle is blocked. ‘At \\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg\nA)\\)’ will be interpreted as: \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or\nproposition) that A \\(\\wedge \\neg A\\), whereas ‘at \\(w:\nA\\)’ will mean that \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or proposition)\nthat A, and ‘not at \\(w: A\\)’ will\nmean that \\(w\\) does not contain the sentence (or proposition)\nthat A. But an impossible world may contain both, or neither,\nof \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), so that containing one implies\nnothing about containing the other. An impossible world may (depending\non how fine-grained we take them to be) also contain the conjunction\n\\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) independently of whether it contains\nboth \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A.\\) So the inference from ‘at\n\\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg A)\\)’ to ‘(at\n\\(w: A) \\wedge \\neg\\)(at \\(w: A)\\)’\nis blocked (possibly twice over).  \nIt is controversial whether any genuine account of worlds can block the\nexportation principle. Jago 2013a,b argues not; Yagisawa 2015 responds\nin defence of genuine impossible worlds. \nIf there are impossible worlds, then we cannot accept the simple\nclause for possibility: \nOnce impossible worlds enter the stage, (P) becomes false from right\nto left. We therefore need a principle that restricts the\nquantification in the right half of the biconditional to\npossible worlds. How to do that, without appealing to modal\nnotions, is not straightforward. The hybrid account (Berto 2010) has\nthe advantage here. If possible worlds are all and only the genuine\nones, with impossible worlds as ersatz constructions of some kind,\nthen we can capture the intent of (P) as: \nNote that it doesn’t matter if the hybrid account accepts the\nexistence of ersatz possible worlds in addition to her genuine\npossible worlds: (P\\({}^*\\)) will still give the right result. \nThe ersatzist may respond by biting the bullet. Even without admitting\nimpossible worlds, most possible worlds accounts do not aim at\nproviding a reductive and complete analysis of modality.\n(Lewis’s modal realism does. But it may not succeed, when\nso-called ‘alien’ properties, not instantiated by anything\nat the actual world nor obtainable as constructions out of actually\ninstantiated properties, enter the stage. See Divers 2002, Chapter 7;\nDivers & Melia 2002.)  \nStalnaker (1996) argues that, whilst there is nothing wrong in\nadmitting impossible worlds, not much explanatory work can be expected\nfrom them. For instance, if one takes worlds as sets of propositions,\nthen one cannot then analyze propositions as sets of worlds. But the\nsame point can be made against any account of possible worlds (such as\nAdams’s) that takes them to be maximally consistent sets of\npropositions. And, just as ersatz possible worlds needn’t be\nconstructed in this way, nor need ersatz impossible worlds. Impossible\nworlds have found many uses in the recent literature, as we have\nabundantly seen. So we don’t find Stalnaker’s worry\nconvincing. \nThe standard semantic clause for negation has it that \\(\\neg A\\)\nis true if and only if \\(A\\) is not true. So there could not be\nworlds at which both or neither of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are\ntrue, unless we revise the semantics of negation. Stalnaker (1996)\nargues that negation is such a basic operator, whose semantics is\n‘learned in a first logic class’ that it had better be\nleft alone.  \nTo this, the impossible world theorist can reply that it is in fact\nthe case that \\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is not\ntrue; for this concerns truth simpliciter, that is, truth at\nthe actual world. She may also agree that the same holds for any\npossible world. But it is precisely impossible worlds that we\nare talking about here; how negation works at any possible world need\nnot be affected by the fact that, at some impossible world or other,\nsome sentence can hold together with its negation: this is one of the\nthings that makes them impossible, after all.  \nTimothy Williamson (2007, Chapter 5) has objected to non-trivial\ntreatments of counterpossibles, in particular (though not perforce)\nwhen they resort to impossible worlds. Consider the claim:  \nPrima facie, this is a non-trivially true counterpossible.\nHowever, Williamson argues, other non-trivial consequences of the\nsupposition would then be that \\(5 + 5 = 11\\), and \\(5 + 4 = 10\\), and\n… , and \\(0 = 1\\). Therefore,  \nBut (2) is clearly false.  \nBrogaard & Salerno (2007) pose a dilemma for Williamson: either we\nhold the context fixed in this kind of counterpossible reasoning, or\nwe don’t. If we don’t, then (2) does not follow from (1).\nIn particular, the context at which (2) comes out false is one at\nwhich the closest antecedent worlds are possible and, to be sure, at\nthose worlds, 0 is not 1. But if we hold the context fixed, then what\ndoes follow is just the following counterpossible:  \nNow this is intuitively true, and non-trivially so.  \nWilliamson (2007) also argues that non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles create opaque contexts, in which the substitutivity\nof co-referential terms fails. Supporters of non-trivial\ncounterpossibles will take the following conditional as false:  \nGiven the necessity of identity, (4) is a counterpossible: as Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, its antecedent can only be true at impossible worlds.\nThat’s false, supposedly, because even if Hesperus and\nPhosphorus had been distinct, Phosphorus would have remained\nself-identical. However, all accept that \nsince it is an instance of ‘if it had been that \\(A\\), then\nit would have been that \\(A\\)’. Yet substituting\n‘Phosphorus’ for the first occurrence of\n‘Hesperus’ in the consequent of (5) gives (4). Since (5)\nis true and (4) is (supposedly) false, substitution of identicals has\nfailed. This failure of substitutivity, Williamson claims, is a bad\nresult, for counterfactuals should not create opaque\ncontexts.  \nBrogaard and Salerno (2013) accept that counterpossibles do create\nopaque contexts. They argue that the impossible worlds similarity\nsemantics for counterpossibles should be “partially\nepistemic” (Brogaard & Salerno 2013: 654), and this\nepistemic component explains the failure of substitution. \nAn alternative reply to Williamson is that the objection is\nquestion-begging. It is clearly false that counterfactuals allow\nsubstitution of identical terms (of any type). ‘Had Aristotle\nnever taught, Aristotle would still have been Aristotle’ is\ntrue, and Aristotle is the teacher of Alexander, yet ‘had\nAristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been the teacher of\nAlexander’ is clearly false. The substitution principle must be\nrestricted to rigid designators: terms that denote the same\nentity in all metaphysically possible worlds. But one may\nthen reply: what’s so special about the class of metaphysically\npossible worlds, when it comes to evaluating counterfactuals? It seems\nquestion-begging (against an account in terms of both possible and\nimpossible worlds) to insist the metaphysically possible worlds play a\nspecial role here. (Note that if we consider terms that are rigid with\nrespect to the nomically possible worlds, or to all worlds, then no\nproblem arises for the account.)  \nBerto et al. 2018 is an extensive discussion of a number of\nWilliamsonian objections to non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles. \nCompositionality is the principle that the meaning or content\nof a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its\nconstituent expressions. It’s commonly taken to be a mandatory\nfeature of any adequate theory of meaning and content. The argument is\nthat, as competent speakers of a language, we are in principle capable\nof grasping the meanings of a potentially infinite number of\nsentences. And since we’ve learnt the meanings of a limited\nnumber of words, this is possible only if the meanings of complex\nsentences are obtainable recursively from the meanings of their\nconstituent parts (Davidson 1965).  \nThe worry is that a theory of meaning or content which includes\nimpossible worlds will not be compositional. Consider what we said\nabove about the exportation principle (Section 6.1) and the semantics\nof negation (Section 6.4). An impossible world may represent that\n\\(\\neg A\\) independently of whether it represents that\n\\(A\\). But then, for such worlds, the truth-value of\n\\(\\neg A\\) is not a function of the truth-value of \\(A\\).\nSo, the worry goes, the content or proposition that \\(\\neg A\\),\nunderstood as a set of possible and impossible worlds, will not be a\nfunction of the proposition that \\(A\\). (Certainly, the latter is\nnot the set-theoretic complement of the former, as it is on the\npossible worlds account.) The same goes for all the other logically\ncomplex sentences. This is perhaps the most serious objection to the\nimpossible worlds approach. If it can’t be met, it may well be\nfatal. \nTo address the worry, defenders of impossible worlds must show that\ntheir notion of content is compositional. Note that that’s\nnot obviously the same as giving compositional\ntruth-conditions for the connectives and operators. An impossible\nworlds account can’t do the latter in a uniform way, for at least some\ntruth-conditions (as necessary truths) will not be respected by some\nimpossible worlds. \nThe only attempt we know of to address the compositionality worry is\nBerto and Jago 2019, Chapter 8. They view impossible worlds as sets of\nsentences (of some ‘worldmaking’ language), where those\nsentences have a compositional structure. They then argue that, given\nany semantic content, a grammatical structure can be recovered and\nanalysed in terms of the syntactic structure of the underlying\nworldmaking sentences. Whether this provides an acceptable notion of\ncompositionality (as they claim) remains to be seen.  \nUndoubtedly, other objections to impossible worlds can and are likely\nto be raised. The current debate on impossible worlds appears to be at\nthe same stage as the one on possible worlds was, some forty\nyears ago. At that time, people struggled to make sense of the concept\nof a possible world. Many declared it meaningless. Nowadays, the\nvariety of its applications has placed the notion firmly at the core\nof much philosophical and logical practice (see e.g., Divers 2002,\nChapter 4). Impossible worlds may undergo the same fate, should they\nprove as useful as they appear to be in the treatment of\nimpossibilities of various kinds.","contact.mail":"fb96@st-andrews.ac.uk","contact.domain":"st-andrews.ac.uk"},{"date.published":"2009-09-17","date.changed":"2018-08-31","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impossible-worlds/","author1":"Francesco Berto","author2":"Mark Jago","author1.info":"http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/philosophy/people/fb96","entry":"impossible-worlds","body.text":"\n\n\nAccording to\n David Hume,\n the impossible cannot be conceived.\n Moritz Schlick\n claimed that the logically impossible, such as an explicit\ninconsistency, is simply unthinkable. Yet\n Hegel\n complained that it is “one of the fundamental prejudices of\nlogic as hitherto understood” that “the contradictory\ncannot be imagined or thought” (Hegel 1931: 430). On this\napproach, our representational capabilities are not limited to the\npossible: we are able to conceive, describe, and sometimes even\nbelieve, impossibilities.\n\n\nThis entry is about impossibilities. In order to read it fruitfully,\nyou might also want to consult the entry on\n possible worlds.\n Many accounts of impossible worlds are best understood against the\nbackground of possible worlds theories — although symmetries and\nsimilarities can sometimes break down in important respects. (We will\nsee one in\n section 4\n below.) You might also want to look at the entry on\n modal logic\n to grasp some basic notions of worlds semantics.\n\n\nWe commonly speak of things being impossible in a relative\nsense. If you are stuck in a traffic jam in Paris Montparnasse at 2\nPM, and your flight is leaving from airport Charles De Gaulle at 2:30\nPM, you may moan: “There is no way that I can make it to the\nairport in time”. What you mean is that, given the timing, the\nmeans of transport available, and other circumstances, it is\nimpossible for you to reach the airport in time. It is not absolutely\nimpossible: if you had Star Trek’s transporter, you could make it.\n\n\nThis entry is about worlds that are not possible, with\n“possible” understood in an unrestricted sense. Start with\nthe intuitive idea of the totality of possible worlds, which capture\nall and only the genuine possibilities. The worlds we are interested\nin are not in there. These worlds are often called logically\nimpossible worlds, as logical laws such as the Law of\nNon-Contradiction or the Law of Excluded Middle are assumed to be the\nmost general and topic-neutral: they are supposed to hold at all\npossible worlds. From now on, we are talking of impossible worlds\nsimpliciter, meaning worlds that are not possible with\nrespect to an unrestricted notion of possibility, however this is\nfurther characterized.\n\n\nA look at the rapidly growing literature on impossible worlds (see\nNolan 2013 for a survey) presents us with a number of definitions.\nThese can be reduced to four main items:\n\n\nImpossible Ways: just as possible worlds are often introduced\nintuitively by characterising them as ways things could have been, so\nare impossible worlds often characterized as ways things could not\nhave been. The initial insight is that not everything is possible,\nthat is, some things just (absolutely) cannot happen. Anything that\njust can’t happen must be an absolute impossibility; and these\nways the world just couldn’t be are impossible worlds (see e.g.\nSalmon 1984; Yagisawa 1988; Restall 1997; Beall & van Fraassen\n2003). \n\n\nLogic Violators: another definition has it that impossible\nworlds are worlds where the laws of logic fail. This depends on what\nwe take the laws of logic to be. Given some logic L, an impossible\nworld with respect to the L-laws is one in which some of those laws\nfail to hold (see e.g. Priest 2001, Chapter 9). An impossible world in\nthis second sense will be an impossible world in the first sense,\ngiven that logical necessity is unrestricted. But not vice versa.\nSuppose it’s metaphysically necessary that the Mona Lisa (if it\nexists) was painted by da Vinci. Then a world in which the Mona Lisa\nwas painted by Neil Buchanan on Art Attack is an impossible\nworld in the first sense but not in the second, for it does not\nviolate any logical law.\n\n\nClassical Logic Violators: another definition has it that\nimpossible worlds are worlds where the laws of classical\nlogic fail (see e.g. Priest 1997a). A world complying with\n intuitionistic logic,\n and where instances of the Law of Excluded Middle fail, will be\nimpossible in the third sense.\n\n\nContradiction-Realizers: a still more specific definition has\nit that an impossible world is a world where sentences of the form\n\\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold, against the Law of\nNon-Contradiction (see e.g. Lycan 1994). Impossible worlds of the\nfourth kind will be impossible in the third sense, but not vice versa.\nOur intuitionistic world above will have the Law of Non-Contradiction\nhold unrestrictedly: it will be impossible in the third, but not in\nthe fourth sense.\n\nWhy might one believe in impossible worlds? One argument is the\nso-called “argument from ways” (Vander Laan 1997), which\nis related to the first definition of impossible world given above.\nThis draws on the analogy with\n David Lewis’s\n notorious argument concerning our quantifying over ways things could\nhave been (see Lewis 1973: 84). The world could have been different in\nso many ways: Hilary Clinton could have won the 2016 US election, I\ncould be dancing on the ceiling, and Fermat’s Last Theorem could have\nremained without proof. Our belief in possible worlds is just a\nparaphrase of our belief that there are many ways the world could have\nbeen. \nAren’t there also ways the world could not have been? Some\nauthors endorse the claim that anything is possible (e.g.\nMortensen 1989). However, the majority of philosophers believe that\nnot everything is possible, in the sense that some things just\ncan’t happen. If I tell you that my college has a cupola\nwhich is both fully round and fully square, you are likely to reply,\n“it can’t be that way!”. So it seems that\n“‘ways’ talk goes both ways” (Beall and van\nFraassen 2003: 86). If quantification on ways the world could have\nbeen should be taken at face value as providing evidence for possible\nworlds, then quantification on ways the world could not have been\nshould be taken at face value as providing evidence for impossible\nworlds. \nThe argument as such is hardly convincing. Firstly, one author’s\nmodus ponens is another’s modus tollens. Some have\nused similar considerations to argue against Lewis’s modal realism\n(see Skyrms 1976; Naylor 1986): if one believes in possible worlds (of\nthe Lewisian kind) as ways things could have been, then by parity of\nreasoning one should believe in impossible worlds (ditto) as ways\nthings could not have been. But impossible worlds are too much to\nswallow, so (by modus tollens) one should not believe in\nLewis’s modal realism. \nSecondly, taking quantification over any kind of entity whatsoever at\nface value, just because it is embedded in ordinary language, doesn’t\nlook like a promising general strategy. Lewis’s case for accepting\ncommitment to possible worlds did not consist just in an argument from\nways. He also provided independent motivation for taking\nquantification over possible worlds at face value. A non-reductive\naccount of possible worlds, according to Lewis, brings net theoretical\nutility. The ontological cost is compensated by a theoretical gain,\ngiven the variety of ontological, semantic, and conceptual\nexplanations allowed by our taking the notion of possible world\nseriously. This is likely to be the main motivation for believing in\nimpossible worlds. As we will see below, defenders of impossible\nworlds claim that they are are theoretically useful. \nAnother argument on behalf of impossible worlds, quite pervasive in\nthe literature, comes from counterpossible reasoning (e.g.\nBeall & van Fraassen 2003, Chapter 4; Nolan 1997; Restall 1997;\nBrogaard & Salerno 2013). This is reasoning from suppositions,\nassumptions, or conditional antecedents which are not only false, but\nimpossible. We can reason non-trivially from impossible suppositions,\nby asking what would be the case, were (say) the Law of\nExcluded Middle false. To say that we reason non-trivially\nfrom an assumption means just that we accept some conclusions but\nreject others on the basis of that assumption. If we hypothetically\nsuppose the Law of Excluded Middle to be false, for example, then we\nwould likely conclude that intuitionistic logic would be preferable to\nclassical logic, given that supposition. We are unlikely to conclude\nthat classical logic would be a satisfactory logic, or that scarlet\nwould be a shade of green, given that supposition. The point readily\ngeneralizes to reasoning about entire theories and to serious\nphilosophical and logical debates. We often reason from suppositions\nabout the truth of certain logical, mathematical, or metaphysical\ntheories which, if in fact false, are necessarily false, because of\nthe very nature of their subject matter. \nThis kind of reasoning is related to our assessment of certain\nconditional statements with impossible antecedents, often called\ncounterpossible conditionals or, more simply,\ncounterpossibles. These include statements such as, if\nExcluded Middle were false, classical logic would not be an acceptable\nlogic. Let’s call a conditional like this trivially true\nwhen it is true and the conditional with the same antecedent and\nopposite (negated) consequent is also true. Consider these\nexamples: \nThe first is intuitively true, the second intuitively false. If that’s\ncorrect, then there are non-trivially true counterpossibles. These\nconsiderations impact on our preferred semantics for such\nconditionals, for the possible worlds semantics for conditionals has\ntrouble accommodating this position. Yet the analysis in terms of\nworlds does a good job for conditionals with possible antecedents.\nThis motivates a semantics for counterpossibles in terms of impossible\n(as well as possible) worlds. We will get into more detail in\n section 2.5. \nThese kinds of argument highlight the usefulness of impossible worlds\nas devices for analyzing particular linguistic, logical, and\nphilosophical issues. The point can be expanded into the general\n“argument from utility” mentioned above: we should believe\nin impossible worlds because they are useful tools for logicians and\nphilosophers. Whether that general argument is acceptable depends on\nhow persuasive the specific impossible worlds analyses are. Let’s look\nat some. \nThis section briefly describes various applications of impossible\nworlds, which collectively provide the main motivation for introducing\nthem. \nModelling intentional states, such as knowledge and belief, is a\nprominent motivation for introducing impossible worlds. The intuitive\nidea is that one gains knowledge or belief by ruling out would-be\npossibilities (the epistemic/doxastic possibilities for that\nagent). An agent’s knowledge is whatever is true according to all\nepistemically possible worlds accessible to that agent, i.e., the\nworlds which represent ways things could be, for all the agent knows\n(and similarly for belief). \nImpossible worlds are useful within this approach because these\nwould-be possibilities often turn out to be impossible. Our beliefs\nare often (covertly) inconsistent with one another. Moreover, our\nknowledge and belief is not closed under (classical) logical\nconsequence: we do not know or believe all consequences of what we\nknow or believe. It is hard to accommodate these features using only\npossible worlds. Possible worlds models usually generate the problem\nof logical omniscience (see\n epistemic logic),\n which we will discuss in\n section 5.3. \nOne feature of rational agents’ intentional states is that they\ntypically reject obvious impossibility or absurdity whilst\nbeing subject to subtle inconsistency (Lewis 2004). One\nattempt to capture this feature is developed through Jago 2006, 2007,\n2009, 2014a. The idea is that only genuine possibilities and\nnon-obvious impossibilities should be epistemically accessible to\nrational (but imperfect) agents such as us. For some agents, it may be\nepistemically possible that Fermat’s Last Theorem’s is false, but 0\nbeing 1 shouldn’t be epistemically possible for anyone. That’s why we\nknow the latter but may fail to know the former, says Jago. One worry\nwith this approach is that it is in part proof theoretic, whereas it\nisn’t clear that proof length correlates well with obviousness.\nBjerring (2013) presents other objections to the view. A strategy\nsimilar to Jago’s is adopted in Berto 2014, 2017. \nA quite different application of impossible worlds to epistemic states\nhas been proposed by JC Beall 2009, in relation to the\n Church-Fitch knowability paradox.\n The Church-Fitch reasoning is supposed to show that is contradictory\nto suppose that any truth can be known (as some anti-realists\nclaim). The reasoning is this. Suppose all truths are knowable but\nsome are not in fact known. Then some truth \\(A\\), is not known:\n\\(A \\wedge \\neg KA\\). By assumption, it’s possible to\nknow this: \\(\\Diamond K(A \\wedge \\neg KA)\\). Seemingly\ngood reasoning (in classical epistemic logic) implies that it’s\npossible both to know and not know that \\(A\\):\n\\(\\Diamond(KA \\wedge \\neg KA)\\), which of course\nisn’t possible at all. The usual moral to draw is that not all\ntruths are knowable. Beall’s idea, by contrast, is that the\nknowability principle can be maintained (and the corresponding kind of\nanti-realism along with it). His suggestion is to deny\ndistribution of knowledge over conjunction: the principle\nthat knowing that \\(A \\wedge B\\) implies knowing that\n\\(A\\) and knowing that \\(B\\). He achieves this using\nimpossible worlds in which conjunctions may be true even if their\nconjuncts are not. \nClosely connected with inconsistent information is the issue of\nmodelling inconsistent databases (see Barwise 1997). These\nmay consist, for instance, in sets of data supplied by different\nsources which are inconsistent with each other, such as incompatible\nevidence presented by different witnesses in a trial. Intuitively, we\nare allowed to draw the logical consequences of data fed in by a\nsingle source, but should not conjoin data from distinct\nsources which may be inconsistent with each other. The data base is\n“compartimentalized”: occasional inconsistencies are\nplaced in separate sectors and should not be asserted conjunctively\n(see e.g., Hyde 1997, Brown & Priest 2004). Impossible worlds are\nuseful in such models—particularly non-adjunctive\nworlds, where a conjunction may be false even if both conjuncts are\ntrue. (We discuss such worlds further in\n section 5.2.) \nInconsistent information is at issue also in certain works of\nfiction.\nLewis’s classic 1978 paper proposed an analysis of the expression\n“true in such-and-such fiction” in terms of possible\nworlds. What holds in a certain fictional work is what holds at a set\nof possible worlds, properly selected via a series of (quite subtle\nand complex) clauses. But fiction can be occasionally inconsistent.\nSometimes, this happens unintentionally: Conan Doyle’s The Sign of\nthe Four describes Watson as limping because of a war wound at\nhis leg. In A Study in Scarlet, however, Watson has no wound\nat his leg (for his wound is in his shoulder and he doesn’t limp). One\nmay claim that the set of worlds that make such stories true has to be\nsplit into disjoint subsets, making true consistent fragments of the\nfiction. This strategy won’t always work, however, for inconsistencies\nin fiction may be intentional (as stressed in Proudfoot 2006). Suppose\nwe write a novel, and in its first chapter we have the Mad\nMathematician produce a round square. If the intentional inconsistency\nis excised, the fact that mathematicians all over the world are amazed\nby this result in the second chapter becomes unexplainable. A natural\ntreatment of these cases, then, is obtained by admitting\n(appropriately selected) impossible worlds in the set of situations\nthat realize what is told in the story (see e.g. Priest 1997b; Woods\n2003, Chapter 6; Berto 2012, Chapters 7 and 8, Badura and Berto\nforthcoming). \nClosely connected to belief is the notion of propositional\ncontent. Within possible worlds semantics,\n propositions\n can be defined as functions from worlds to truth values, or as sets\nof worlds: a proposition is the set of worlds at which it is true. The\naccount is notoriously too coarse-grained (Barwise 1997). Intuitively\ndistinct impossible propositions (that swans are blue and not blue;\nthat Fermat’s Last Theorem is false; that Charles is a married\nbachelor) all hold at precisely no possible worlds. And we have a dual\nproblem with (unrestrictedly) necessary propositions, which are all\nidentified with the set of all possible worlds. Treating propositions\nas set-theoretic constructions out of possible worlds leads to a very\ncoarse individuation of propositions, and because of this it has been\nsubject to seemingly devastating attacks, for instance, by Scott\nSoames 1987. However, impossible worlds allow for fine-grained\ndistinctions unavailable in standard possible worlds semantics. An\nimpossible proposition need not be equated with the empty set of\nworlds, for it may be a set which includes (only) impossible worlds.\nWe can have an impossible world \\(w_1\\) with impossibly\ncoloured swans, a distinct impossible world \\(w_2\\) at\nwhich Fermat’s Last Theorem is false, and a further impossible world\n\\(w_3\\) at which bachelors are married (but at which\nswans and Diophantine equations behave correctly). Ripley (2013)\nargues that an account along these lines is a better strategy for\naddressing the coarse-grainedness problem than resorting to\n structured propositions. \nOne other application of impossible worlds concerns\nperceptual impossibilities. When we see an Escher drawing or\na Penrose triangle, our experience has content. But that content is\nimpossible: such structures cannot be realised. The content of our\nexperience in such cases is naturally captured using impossible\nworlds. Splitting that content into smaller internally consistent\nparts would lose the essential feature of the whole. This issue is\nexplored in Mortensen 1997. \nPerhaps the most important application of impossible worlds has to do\nwith counterpossible reasoning, understood as counterfactual reasoning\nfrom impossible antecedents. As we saw in\n section 1,\n this kind of reasoning is often taken to provide independent\nmotivation for believing in impossible worlds. In Lewis-Stalnaker\ntheories of counterfactuals, a conditional of the form, “if it\nwere the case that \\(A\\), then it would be the case that\n\\(B\\)” is true if and only if, at the closest world (or\nclosest worlds) at which \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is also true.\n(This is a simplification of the truth conditions provided in the\nfull-fledged semantics of Lewis 1973.) \nWhile the standard conditional logics based on this idea have been\nquite successful in the treatment of counterfactuals, the approach\nentails that any counterfactual whose antecedent is impossible is\nvacuously true. For if there are no possible worlds at which\n\\(A\\) is true, then trivially, all closest \\(A\\)-worlds\n(worlds where \\(A\\) is true) are \\(B\\)-worlds. This is\nunsatisfying in many respects, for we often need to reason\nnontrivially about theories that (perhaps unbeknownst to us) cannot\npossibly be correct; and we often need to reason from antecedents that\nmay turn out to be not only false, but necessarily so. (Compare the\nexample conditionals (1.1) and (1.2) in\n section 1\n for an example.) \nThree contexts in which theories of this kind show up are discourses\non (1) alternative logics, (2) mathematical conjectures, and (3)\nmetaphysical views. We will now say a few words on each of them. \n(1) A famous Quinean motto has it that “to change the logic is\nto change the subject”: apparently disagreeing logical parties\nare actually speaking of different things. So when intuitionists deny\nthat the Law of Excluded Middle holds in non-finitary contexts, they\nare actually changing the meaning of logical operators; when\nparaconsistentists claim that some formula can be true (in some weird\ncircumstances) together with its negation, they are not talking\nof negation anymore (see e.g., Berto 2008). \nBut this does not make good sense of many disputes between\nintuitionists, classical logicians, paraconsistentists, quantum\nlogicians, etc. It is more fruitful to assume that each party\ngenerally understands the rival logics as intelligible, albeit\nnecessarily false, theories. Even if classical logic actually is the\none true logic, one can reason counterpossibly about what would be the\ncase if a certain non-classical logic were the correct one (e.g.,\n“if intuitionistic logic were correct, then the Law of Excluded\nMiddle would fail” is true and “if intuitionistic logic\nwere correct, then the Law of Explosion would fail” is false).\nOne can take into account situations in which the Law of Excluded\nMiddle fails and argue about what would and would not be the case in\nthem. These situations are, by classical standards, just impossible\nworlds (of the third kind: Classical Logic Violators). \n(2) Similar claims can be made for mathematical conjectures. Different\nset theorists have different views on controversial subjects such as\nnon-well-founded sets, the\n Continuum Hypothesis,\n the Axiom of Choice, the set/(proper-)class distinction, etc. If one\nembraces the Platonic view (subscribed to, at least implicitly, by\nmany set theorists) that there is One True Universe of sets, then at\nmost one of the alternative set theories can be correct: the others\nare wrong, and necessarily so. But people can work under the\nhypothesis that a necessarily false basic mathematical principle\nholds, and reason coherently from this: \nField takes this as an argument to the effect that mathematical\nnecessity is not coextensive with logical necessity. But we can turn\nthe tables around: mathematical necessity is unrestricted and false\nmathematical theories are just impossible theories. \n(3) The third area in which counterpossible reasoning comes into play\nare metaphysical disputes (and more broadly, any philosophical dispute\nwhose subject matter is necessarily true or necessarily false). Much\nmetaphysical talk is made with our quantifiers “wide\nopen”, that is, aiming at stating truths about all that there\nwas, is, or could possibly be. This is evident in modal ontology, when\npeople advance a theory on the totality of worlds and on their nature.\nBut other metaphysical debates easily come to mind. Suppose a\nphilosopher wants to evaluate metaphysical theories which she\nconsiders wrong (say, in order to draw unpalatable consequences by way\nof criticism), such as Spinoza’s monism or Hegel’s metaphysics of the\nAbsolute. She must envisage situations where such metaphysics are\ncorrect and wonder what would be the case according to them:\nsituations at which there is only one substance, or at which the\nAbsolute Geist necessarily shapes the teleological\ndevelopment of history. These situations will be, under the hypotheses\nwe have made, impossible worlds. \nSemantic structures for counterfactual conditionals involving\nimpossible worlds were first introduced by Routley 1989, and have been\nproposed e.g. by Read 1995, Mares & Fuhrmann 1995, Mares 1997,\nNolan 1997, Brogaard & Salerno 2013, Bjerring 2014, Berto et al.\n2018. Most of these are natural extensions of Lewis’s 1973 semantics\nfor counterfactuals and capture several intuitions about\ncounterpossible reasoning. The main task for such theories consists in\naccounting for the concepts of closeness and qualitative similarity\nbetween worlds once impossible worlds enter the stage. How to\nfine-tune these notions is not a trivial matter (for an extensive\ndiscussion, see Vander Laan 2004; we will say more in\n section 4.2). \nNon-trivial treatments of counterpossibles require the failure of\nseveral logical principles which hold in the standard Lewis-Stalnaker\napproach to counterfactuals (Williamson 2007 chapter 5, Brogaard &\nSalerno 2013). (Williamson uses these failures to argue that\ncounterpossibles are always trivially true.) One important principle\nthat fails is the entailment from a strict conditional, “if\n\\(A\\) then-strictly \\(B\\)”, to the corresponding\ncounterfactual, “if it were the case that \\(A\\) then it\nwould be the case that \\(B\\)”. Normally, the former entails\nthe latter. A strict conditional is true when all the (accessible)\npossible worlds where the antecedent is true also make the consequent\ntrue. If all the possible \\(A\\)-worlds are \\(B\\)-worlds,\nthen in particular all the closest possible \\(A\\)-worlds are\n\\(B\\)-worlds. In an account which admits impossible worlds,\nhowever, we can have closest impossible worlds where \\(A\\)\nobtains and \\(B\\) fails, making the counterpossible false even\nthough the corresponding strict conditional is true. \nThe ensuing anarchy can be mitigated to some extent, e.g., by assuming\nwhat Nolan 1997 calls the Strangeness of Impossibility\nCondition (SIC): any possible world, however weird, should be\ncloser to any possible world \\(w\\) than any impossible world is\nto \\(w\\). Reality will be turned upside down before logical laws\nor mathematical truths abandon us. Then it is plausible that the\nLewis-Stalnaker principles will still hold whenever the relevant\nantecedent is possible. For then we will consider only the\nclosest antecedent-worlds when we evaluate the conditional, all of\nwhich will be possible worlds: the impossible ones will be too far\naway (Berto et al. 2018). \nSupporters of impossible worlds disagree over their metaphysical\nnature, just as supporters of possible worlds do. If one accepts\nontological commitment to worlds of any kind, then one faces the\nfollow-up question: just what are they, metaphysically speaking?  \nThe two main options among modal realists (philosophers who\naccept possible worlds in their ontology) are David Lewis’s\nextreme or genuine modal realism and\nersatzism (or actualism or abstractionism:\nthese terms all have slightly different connotations, which we’ll\nignore here). It is a common thought among impossible worlds theorists\nthat impossible worlds should just inherit the ontological status of\ntheir possible mates: whatever your favorite metaphysics of possible\nworlds is, impossible worlds are of the same kind. This has been\ncalled the Parity Thesis (see Rescher & Brandom 1980). As\nGraham Priest puts it: \nYagisawa’s extended modal realism proposes a Lewis-inspired\nrealist account of impossible worlds and impossibilia (the\nobjects exemplifying absolute impossibilities which inhabit impossible\nworlds). On this view, impossible worlds are concrete mereological\nsums of real individuals, which are causally and spatiotemporally\ninterrelated within each world but never across worlds (see Yagisawa\n1988). Yagisawa exploits the “argument from ways” we met\nabove: if quantification on ways the world might be or have been\ncommits us to possible worlds, then, by parity of reasoning,\nquantification on ways the world might not be commits us to impossible\nworlds. The argument is backed by Yagisawa’s considerations on the\nadditional logical and philosophical applications allowed by\nimpossible worlds, which are not available, in his view, to\ntraditional Lewisian modal realism. Extended modal realism is a strong\nposition: concrete impossible worlds represent absolute and logical\nimpossibilities directly, by instantiating them. So\nimpossibilities and, in particular, logical inconsistencies, are\n“out there” in reality. \nIn his 2010 book, Yagisawa is more distant from Lewisian modal\nrealism. He still admits impossible worlds and impossibilia,\nand he rejects ersatz accounts of them. However, he now takes worlds\nto be points in modal space. Worlds are modal indices for truth, just\nlike times are temporal indices for it; and modal matters are treated\nin a way similar to how four-dimensionalist philosophers, who believe\nin\n temporal parts,\n treat temporal matters. According to four-dimensionalists, material\nobjects are like temporal worms extended across time: an object has a\nproperty at time \\(t\\) by having a temporal stage at time\n\\(t\\) which has that property. Analogously, for Yagisawa an\nobject has a modal property, a property at world \\(w\\), by having\na modal stage at world \\(w\\) which has that property. \nMore moderate (Yagisawa would say: too moderate) realists\ntreat impossible worlds as ersatz constructions: abstract\nentities on a par with ersatz possible worlds (see e.g. Mares 1997,\nVander Laan 1997). Modal ersatzism comes in various shapes (Divers\n2002, Part III, is by far the best critical evaluation in the\nliterature). If one takes possible worlds as maximally consistent sets\nof propositions (as per Adams 1974), impossible worlds could be sets\nof propositions that are inconsistent and/or incomplete. Similarly,\nPlantingan ersatzism (possible worlds are particular states of\naffairs) or Stalnakerian ersatzism (possible worlds are world-natures\nor maximal properties) could be easily extended to accommodate\nimpossible worlds. All hands agree that such worlds come at no great\nontological or theoretical cost, once one has accepted ersatz possible\nworlds. After all, ersatz worlds are abstract: they account for\nimpossibilities, not by instantiating them as Lewisian worlds do, but\nby representing them in some way or other. Jago (2012) takes both\npossible and impossible worlds to be constructions out of positive and\nnegative facts, such as Barack Obama’s not being French (see the entry\non\n facts). \nThe extension of ersatzism from possible to impossible worlds appears\nto be particularly straightforward for linguistic ersatzism.\nOn this approach, possible worlds are world-books: sets of\nsentences of a special “worldmaking” language. (Carnap’s\n(1947) state-descriptions and Jeffrey’s (1983) complete consistent\nnovels are examples of this strategy.) It is easy to admit impossible\nworlds of the same kind, that is, world-books which are locally\ninconsistent or incomplete, which fail to comply with some logical law\nor to be closed under some notion or other of logical consequence. \nHowever, there may be reasons to reject the Parity Thesis. If Lewis’s\ncriticisms of ersatzism in On the Plurality of Worlds are\nright, then each ersatz account of impossible worlds inherits the\nlimits of ersatz theories of possible worlds: each of these theories\nhas to resort to intensional entities taken as primitive (such as\npropositions or states of affairs) in its explanation of what ersatz\nworlds are, or to primitive modal notions (most often, to both).\nSuppose that, instead, one wants to retain the advantages of both\nworlds (no pun intended), ersatz and genuine, when it comes to\nimpossibilities. Suppose, that is, that (a) one wants to employ a\nmodal framework including both possible and impossible worlds to\nretain the theoretical benefits provided by the latter; and (b) one\nwants to stick to Lewis’s project of a reductive account of\nintensional and modal notions to fully extensional ones\n(contra ersatzism); but also (c) one wants to avoid the\nunwelcome consequences of concrete impossible worlds instantiating\nimpossibilities, such as having true contradictions “out\nthere” in reality (contra Yagisawa’s extended modal\nrealism). One could then try the following hybrid solution: (1) go\nrealist about possible worlds, and (2) exploit the set-theoretic\nmachinery of modal realism to represent different impossible worlds as\ndistinct ersatz, abstract constructions. \nTo fulfil these desiderata, Berto 2010 sketches an intermediate\naccount, labeled as Hybrid Modal Realism (HMR), which\ndispenses with the Parity Thesis. The account follows suggestions from\nDivers 2002, Chapter 5, and is similar to a strategy pursued in\nKiourti 2010, Chapter 3. On this view, genuine, concrete possible\nworlds are the basic stuff. Atomic propositions are taken as sets of\npossible worlds. Distinct impossible situations can then be\nrepresented by distinct world-books, taken as set-theoretic\nconstructions from atomic propositions. Krakauer 2013 gives a similar\naccount in terms of\n structured propositions\n built out of ordinary possible worlds. Jago 2012 and Sendłak\n2015 criticise Berto’s approach on the basis that it cannot\ndistinguish the proposition that Hesperus is the second planet\nfrom the sun from the proposition that Phosphorus is the\nsecond planet from the sun. Reinert 2018 attempts to do better by\ncombining Lewisian possible worlds with an ersatz situation-based\naccount of impossible worlds. \nA metaphysical account of impossible worlds, alternative both to\nersatzism and to Lewisian realism, has been proposed in Zalta 1997.\nZalta’s powerful theory of abstract objects is based upon his logic of\nencoding, whose core idea consists in postulating an\nambiguity in the copula of predication: “\\(x\\) is\n\\(P\\)” can mean that object \\(x\\) exemplifies property\n\\(P\\), as per ordinary predication; but it may also mean that\n\\(x\\) encodes \\(P\\), encoding being a special mode of\npredication. An object which encodes a property is determined by it,\nbut without instantiating or exemplifying it. Abstract objects encode\nproperties, besides exemplifying them; in particular, they can encode\nproperties they do not exemplify (see Zalta 1983). Within this theory,\nsituations are defined as abstract objects that encode states\nof affairs (taken as 0-ary properties); and impossible worlds are\ntaken as maximal situations that are not possible, that is, such that\nit is not possible that all the states of affairs encoded by them\nsimultaneously obtain. \nZalta claims that, despite treating worlds as abstract objects, this\nis not an ersatz conception of worlds. A given state of affairs\n\\(p\\)’s obtaining at world \\(w\\) (no matter whether\n\\(w\\) is possible or impossible) is analyzed as: \nand so being-such-that-p is ascribed, in the encoding sense,\nto \\(w\\). As such, \\(w\\) is (in the encoding sense\nof the copula, at least) such that \\(p\\). Thus, according to\nZalta’s theory of encoding, worlds are in some sense metaphysically\ncharacterized or determined by such states of affairs. And according\nto Zalta nothing of the sort can be claimed of ersatz conceptions of\nworlds. \nAll the ontological accounts of impossible worlds presented so far are\nin a broad sense realist. They all accept that sentences referring to\nor quantifying over impossible worlds can be literally true, and take\nthe entailed ontological commitment at face value, although they\ndisagree with each other about the metaphysical status of worlds. A\ndeeply anti-realist alternative to modal metaphysics has also been\ndeveloped:\n modal fictionalism.\n The view is fictionalist (or anti-realist) about worlds. Its\nkey claim is that talk of and quantification over worlds ought to be\nunderstood as literally false: it is only true within a “worlds\nfiction”. We make-believe in the fiction because it delivers\nuseful results in the explanation of modal notions. Modal fictionalism\npromises the theoretical benefits of modal realism without the\nontological costs. We should not include worlds (other than the actual\nworld) in our ontological catalogue. But talking as if there\nwere worlds is useful. Gideon Rosen (1990), a major proponent of the\nview, takes Lewisian modal realism to be the relevant fiction. But it\nis relatively easy to extend such modal fictionalist accounts into\nfictional treatments of possible and impossible worlds,\ntaking e.g. Yagisawa’s extended modal realism as the fiction which we\nmake-believe. JC Beall (2008) proposes an approach to\nimpossible worlds (see\n section 5.1),\n which can be motivated by the idea that these are worlds where\n“logical fictions” take place. \nAnother issue which theories of impossible worlds disagree on concerns\nthe amount of logical structure such worlds have. This issue\naffects impossible worlds specifically: there is no correlative issue\nconcerning possible worlds (beyond our choice of logic). Various\nclasses of impossible worlds display different degrees of anarchic\nlogical behavior: as we shall see, non-normal worlds for non-normal modal logics\n (section 5.1),\n for instance, are such that only modal sentences behave in a\nnon-standard fashion at them, whereas sentences that include just the\nBoolean operators of classical logic get the standard treatment. Such\nworlds appear to be logically more structured than fully anarchic\n“open” worlds\n (section 5.3).\nFor, we shall see, even principles of classical logic involving only\nthe extensional, truth-functional connectives can fail at open worlds:\ntheir openness consists in their not being closed under any\nnon-trivial logical consequence principle. \nShould we require impossible worlds to comply with any\nlogical rules? And if we allow different classes of impossible worlds,\neach exhibiting different degrees of logical structure, can these\nclasses be ordered in a meaningful way? This section focuses on these\ntwo issues. \nAre there any logical principles which impossible worlds must obey?\nMore precisely, is there any logical inference such that, for any\n(impossible) world \\(w\\), if the premises are all true according\nto \\(w\\), then so is the conclusion? There is at least one such\ninference: the trivial inference from \\(A\\) to \\(A\\). (For\nif \\(A\\) is true at world \\(w\\), then \\(A\\) is true at\nworld \\(w\\)!) Are there any others? This is the granularity\nissue. \nIn addressing the issue, a good starting place is Nolan’s\nPrinciple (Nolan 1997: 542): \n(This is not an ‘if and only if’, since the converse is\nclearly false: some impossible world represents your reading this\narticle, yet that’s not at all impossible. Impossible worlds\nrepresent possible and impossible situations. The things they\nrepresent make for an impossible bunch, but might each be possible\nwhen taken individually.) \nThe principle has some intuitive force. Nolan thinks of it as a kind\nof unrestricted ‘comprehension principle’ for\nimpossibilities. It tells something about which impossible worlds\nthere are. There will be worlds which represent that water is not\nH\\(_2\\)O, that \\(2+2=5\\), and that snow both is and is not white.\nOne might think that (NP) entails that ‘anything goes’\nwith regard to impossible worlds: that any logical principle (except\n\\(A \\vDash A)\\) will be broken by some impossible\nworld. If so, then (NP) delivers the open worlds mentioned above.\nHowever, to apply (NP), we need a single object-language sentence\n\\(A\\) which describes an impossibility. Logical laws, by\ncontrast, are stated as relationships between multiple\nobject-language sentences. So it is not clear that (NP) does its\nintended work. \nPriest (2016) adopts two principles that are similar to, but stronger\nthan, (NP): ‘everything holds at some worlds, and everything\nfails at some worlds’ (Priest 2016, 5) and, for any distinct\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), ‘there are worlds where \\(A\\) holds and \\(B\\)\nfails’ (Priest 2016, 7). More specifically, in our terminology:\n \nPriest calls these the ‘primary directive’ and\n‘secondary directive’ on impossible worlds, respectively.\nThe latter implies the former, which in turn implies (NP), but neither\nconverse holds.  \nTo illustrate the extra power (4.2) gives us (over (4.1) and (NP)),\nconsider Simplification, the inference from \\(A \\wedge B\\) to\n\\(A\\), or Disjunction Introduction, from \\(A\\) to \\(A \\vee\nB\\). (4.2) directly entails that there are worlds where these rules\nfail. So, if we find (4.2) plausible, we can infer that impossible\nworlds are not, in general, governed by standard\n paraconsistent logics. \nA paraconsistent logic is any one in which cont radictory\npremises \\(A\\), \\(\\neg A\\) do not entail arbitrary\nconclusions. But standardly, paraconsistent logics maintain the\nprinciple that conjunctions are true just in case both conjuncts are;\ndisjunctions are true just in case at least one disjunct is; and\ndouble negations \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) are true just in case \\(A\\)\nis. If we accept (4.2), then these relationships will break down in\nsome impossible worlds. \nYet even with (4.2) in play, it doesn’t follow that\n‘anything goes’ with impossible worlds. No principle so\nfar entails that some impossible world breaks the Adjunction rule,\nfrom \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to \\(A \\wedge B\\), simply\nbecause 4.2 doesn’t apply to inferences with multiple premises.\n(We discuss Adjunction-violating worlds further in\n section 5.2\n below.) To infer the ‘anything goes’ conclusion, that for\nany logically valid inference there is some impossible world that\nbreaks it, we’ll need this principle: \nHowever, we can hardly claim that we’ve derived the\n‘anything goes’ picture of impossible worlds from this\nprinciple, for it is, in effect, an explicit statement of that very\nview. Whilst the original (NP) has a good deal of intuitive force,\nit’s much harder to feel that way about (NP\\(^+)\\). \nThere may be no completely general, intuitively motivated principle\n(along the lines of (NP)) from which we can ascertain just how\nfine-grained impossible worlds should be. Nevertheless, there are\narguments which support the ‘anything goes’ picture, on\nwhich there exist open worlds (those closed under no valid inferences\nexcept \\(A \\vDash A)\\). We’ll briefly consider\nthree such arguments. \nThe first is simple. If impossible worlds can break some logical rule,\nthen why can’t they break all of them? Suppose we fix on\nstandard proof rules for the connectives. Each such rule is as closely\ntied to the meaning of the associated connective as the others are (to\ntheir associated connectives). Yet, as each logically impossible world\nbreaks at least one of those rules, what’s to stop some other\nimpossible world from breaking any of the other rules? This argument\nhas some intuitive force, but is clearly far from conclusive. \nThe second argument is from epistemic states. When we consider\nreal-world finite and fallible epistemic agents, there seem to be no\nrules of the form: if someone believes \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\), then they\nmust believe (distinct) \\(B\\) (that’s why the logical\nomniscience problem discussed in 2.3 is hard!). If we model their\nepistemic states in terms of worlds, then at least one of the worlds\nmust break the inference from \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) to \\(B.\\) So each\nlogical inference (except \\(A \\vDash A)\\) is broken by some world\n(Jago 2014a; Priest 2016). \nThe third argument is from counterpossible reasoning. Suppose, in a\nclass on alternative logics, we consider what would happen if Excluded\nMiddle \\((\\vDash A \\vee \\neg A)\\), Double-Negation Elimination \\((\\neg\n\\neg A \\vDash A)\\), or the Law of Explosion \\((A, \\neg A \\vDash B)\\)\nwere to fail. If classical logic is the one true logic, and logical\nnecessity is absolute, we’re then reasoning counterpossibly. If\nwe want to analyse counterpossibles in general using impossible\nworlds, then we’ll need worlds where these principles fail. But\nwe seem to be able to reason this way, non-trivially, for any kind of\nlogical principle, and so our analysis will require open worlds\n(Priest 2016). \nWhy have we spared \\(A \\vDash A\\) so far? Well, it\nseems that in order to break this, an impossible world would\nsimultaneously have to represent that \\(A\\) and not represent\nthat \\(A\\). Such a world would itself be an impossible object,\none with inconsistent features. Since most impossible worlds theorists\nmaintain that impossible worlds (actually) exist and that actuality is\nnot inconsistent, this position is ruled out. It is available to\ndialethists and others who allow reality to have inconsistent\nfeatures. There seems to be no theoretical cost in requiring\n\\(A \\vDash A\\) to hold at all worlds (impossible or\notherwise). Going back to epistemic states, for example, we want to\nrepresent inconsistent beliefs, such as someone’s believing both that\n\\(A\\) and that \\(\\neg A\\) at the same time; but it would be\na mistake to infer that she both believes and does not believe that\n\\(A\\). \nIf impossible worlds display different degrees of logical structure\n(or lack thereof), it may make sense to order them. A natural way to\ndo this is via an extension of the traditional “closeness”\nrelations between possible worlds. How to spell out the ordering in\ndetail, though, is far from straightforward. Within standard\nconditional logics, and in the treatment of counterfactual\nconditionals in terms of possible worlds due to Robert Stalnaker\n(1968) and David Lewis (1973), worlds stand in similarity relations;\nand similarity comes in degrees. This is usually represented by having\neach possible world, \\(w\\), come with a system of\n“spheres”. If \\(W\\) is the set of all worlds, let \\(\\$\\) be a\nfunction from worlds to sets of subsets of \\(W\\), so that \\(\\$w =\n\\{S_1, S_2 , \\ldots \\}\\), with \\(w \\in S_1 \\subseteq S_2 \\subseteq\n\\ldots = W\\). Worlds within a given sphere \\(S_i\\) are more similar to\n\\(w\\) than worlds outside it. \nIf we take the special case in which \\(w =\\) the actual world\n(call it “@”), we get a natural arrangement of possible\nworlds in a system of spheres that mirrors their degree of\n(dis)similarity with respect to @, according to the different kinds of\npossibilities and (relative) impossibilities they represent. For\ninstance, a world which is exactly like @, except that Franz wears a\nwhite t-shirt instead of the black one he’s actually wearing while\nwriting these lines, is, intuitively, closer to @ than a world at\nwhich the laws of physics are turned upside down. Some people have a\ngeneral, intuitive depiction of such closeness relations, and set out\na hierarchy of modalities accordingly: possible worlds where the laws\nof physics are different from ours are naturally seen as more\neccentric than worlds where only biological, but not physical, laws\nare different; and these are more eccentric than possible worlds with\nminimal factual changes with respect to @, such as the white t-shirt\nworld. \nCan such a natural view be extended to impossible worlds? First, it is\nintuitive to claim that some impossible worlds are more similar to the\nactual world @ than others. For instance, the “explosion”\nworld (call it \\(e)\\) at which everything is the case (every\nsentence is true) seems to be as far from @ as one can imagine, if one\ncan actually imagine or conceive such an extremely absurd situation.\nNow, pick the impossible world, \\(t\\), at which everything is as\nin @, except that Franz wears an impossible t-shirt which is white all\nover and black all over. Intuitively, \\(t\\) is closer to @ than\n\\(e\\). \nNext, some authors (e.g. Mares 1997) favor Nolan’s SIC principle\n(introduced in\n section 2.5).\n This implies that any possible world is closer to @ than any\nimpossible world is to @. A system of spheres for impossible worlds\ncentered on @ will just extend the intuitive possible worlds spheres\ndescribed above, by adding further, larger spheres where worlds\noutside (logical, or more generally unrestricted) possibility stand.\nBut how are these latter to be internally ordered? \nOne very general option is the following. Even though we subscribe to\nsome unrestricted comprehension principle for impossible worlds, we\nmay admit that worlds where only the intensional operators, e.g., the\nbox and diamond of necessity and possibility, behave in a non-standard\nfashion are less deviant than worlds where also the extensional\noperators, like classical conjunction and disjunction, do. Let us call\nworlds of the former kind intensionally impossible and worlds\nof the latter kind\nextensionally impossible. This picture (inspired by Priest\n2005, Chapter 1) has some intuitive force to recommend it. Kripkean\nnon-normal worlds, where only the behaviour of the modal operators is\nnon-standard (see\n section 5.1),\n are intuitively less deviant than open worlds, where all formulas may\nbehave arbitrarily. Generalizing, the view would entail arranging the\nrespective spheres in such a way that any intensionally impossible\nworld is closer to @ than any extensionally impossible one. \nThis very general ordering of impossibilities, albeit intuitive, may\nnot be fully satisfying. A general qualm concerns the SIC principle\nitself. For one may claim that, intuitively, some slightly deviant\nimpossible worlds may be more similar to the actual world @\nthan some possible but very weird worlds. For instance, the impossible\nworld \\(t\\) above, which is like @ except for Franz’s wearing an\ninconsistent T-shirt, may look more familiar than a world which is\nlogically possible, but where the laws of physics are turned upside\ndown. Several authors (Nolan 1997, Vander Laan 2004, Bernstein 2016)\nhave proposed putative counterexamples to SIC along these lines. \nAlthough we cannot pursue this topic further within the limits of this\nentry, the discussion developed so far should show that the issue of\nthe structure, closeness, and ordering of impossible worlds is quite\nopen. \nThis section is a bit more technical than the others. None\nof the other sections presuppose this material. \n\n Possible worlds semantics\n is celebrated for providing suitable interpretations for different\naxiomatic systems of\n modal logic,\n such as\n C.I. Lewis’s\n systems \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S5}\\). In each model, sentences are\nevaluated as true or false relative to a possible world. Modal\nsentences \\(\\Box A\\) and \\(\\Diamond A\\) (usually read as\n‘it is necessary that \\(A\\)’ and ‘it is\npossible that \\(A\\)’, respectively) are evaluated in terms\nof \\(A\\)’s truth at all or some of the accessible\nworlds. By placing various conditions on the accessibility relation\nbetween worlds, different modal logics can be accommodated. (Readers\nunfamiliar with modal logic are advised again to read the entities on\n possible worlds\n and\n modal logic\n before going further in this section.) \nThis approach validates the Necessitation inference rule: \nIf \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(\\Box A\\). (In symbols: if\n\\(\\vDash A\\) then \\(\\vDash \\Box A\\).)\n \nTo see why, suppose \\(A\\) is a logical truth. Then in any model,\nit is true at all possible worlds. So given any world \\(w\\) in an\narbitrary model, \\(A\\) is true at all worlds accessible from\n\\(w\\), hence \\(\\Box A\\) is true at \\(w\\), and so\n\\(\\Box A\\) too is valid. \nLogics in which the Necessitation rule is valid are called normal\nmodal logics. But historically, not all of the modal logics of\ninterest are normal logics. C.I. Lewis’s systems \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S3}\\) are non-normal logics, for example. These logics are\nweaker than normal modal logics, in the sense that they\nsupport fewer valid inferences. To give a worlds-based semantics for\nsuch logics, we need to look beyond possible worlds. \nIn 1965, Saul Kripke introduced a special kind of world, the\nnon-normal worlds, in order to provide semantics for\nnon-normal modal logics. Let us introduce some simple semantic\nmachinery for propositional modal logic. Take a non-normal\ninterpretation of a propositional modal language, \\(\\langle W, N, R,\nv\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds; \\(N\\) is a proper subset\nof \\(W\\), the set of normal worlds; \\(R\\) is a binary\naccessibility relation between worlds; and \\(v\\) is a valuation\nfunction assigning truth values to formulas at worlds:\n“\\(v_w(A)\\)” denotes the truth value of \\(A\\) at world\n\\(w\\). Worlds in \\(W - N\\) are the non-normal worlds. The truth\nconditions for the extensional logical vocabulary (negation,\nconjunction, disjunction, the material conditional) are given the\nusual way. The same holds for the modal operators of necessity\n\\(\\Box\\) and possibility \\(\\Diamond\\), but only at normal\nworlds. If \\(w\\) is non-normal, the truth conditions for the\nmodalizers go as follows: \nwhere 1 stands for true, 0 for false. At non-normal\nworlds, formulas of the form £\\(A\\), with £ a modal,\nare not evaluated depending on the truth value of \\(A\\) at other\n(accessible) worlds, but get assigned their truth value directly: all\nbox-formulas are false and all diamond-formulas are true. In a sense,\nat non-normal worlds nothing is necessary, and anything is possible.\nThese worlds, however, are deviant only in this respect: their\nbehavior, as far as the extensional connectives are concerned, is\nquite regular. \nIn some (though not all) worlds semantics, logical validity and\nconsequence are defined relative to just the normal worlds.\nThe idea is that the normal worlds behave ‘appropriately’\nwith respect to the logic in question, whereas the non-normal worlds\ndo not. For example, \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A\\) is valid\nin \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\), but (by definition) it is false at the\nnon-normal worlds. So we need to ignore the non-normal worlds when\ndefining validity and consequence, which we do as follows: \n\\(A\\) is valid \\((\\vDash A)\\) if and only if, for\nall normal worlds \\(w\\) in all models, \\(v_w (A) = 1\\). \nPremises \\(S\\) entail \\(A (S \\vDash A)\\) if and only if, for\nall normal worlds \\(w\\) in all models: if \\(v_w (B) = 1\\) for\nall premises \\(B \\in\\) S, then \\(v_w (A) = 1\\). \nEven though we have ignored the non-normal worlds in this definition,\nthey still play a role in invalidating Necessitation. For take any\nclassical propositional tautology, say \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\). This holds\nat all worlds of all models, so \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds at all\nnormal worlds and hence is valid. But \\(\\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) holds at\nno non-normal world. Now suppose \\(w\\) is a normal world that has\naccess to any non-normal world. Then \\(\\Box \\Box(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) is\nfalse at \\(w\\) and so (since \\(w\\) is normal) \\(\\Box \\Box(A \\vee \\neg\nA)\\) is not valid. That’s a counterexample to Necessitation. \nIn these semantics for non-normal modal logics such as \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{S3}\\), the valuation function assigns the same truth value to all\nbox formulas (false) and all diamond formulas (true) at non-normal\nworlds. But we can do things differently. In Cresswell’s (1966)\nsemantics for the modal system S0.5 (due to E.J. Lemmon\n(1957)), sentences beginning with a modality are assigned\narbitrary truth values. The valuation function \\(v\\) treats\nmodal sentences as if they were atomic sentences.  (Interpretations\nfor \\(\\mathbf{S2}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{S3}\\) are thus special cases of the\ninterpretations for S0.5.) The idea of considering\nimpossible (non-normal) worlds as worlds at which complex formulas are\ntreated as atomic one is a popular one, as we will see below. \nKripke introduced non-normal worlds as a technical device in order to\ntreat C.I. Lewis’ non-normal modal logics; the question of the\ninterpretation of such structures (particularly, of the\nontological status of impossible worlds), then, makes perfect sense\n— and the answer is not straightforward, as have seen in\n section 3. \nIn 1980, Nicholas Rescher and Robert Brandom published The Logic\nof Inconsistency. A Study in Non-Standard Possible-Worlds Semantics\nand Ontology. They introduced a modal semantics including,\nbesides ordinary possible worlds (taken as maximally consistent\ncollections of states of affairs), also non-standard worlds that are\nlocally inconsistent (such that, for some \\(A\\), both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg\nA\\) hold at them), and incomplete (such that for some \\(A\\), neither\n\\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold at them).  These are obtained\ncombinatorially, via two recursive operations having standard worlds\nas their base, and called schematization \\((\\cap)\\)\nand superposition \\((\\cup)\\).  Given two worlds \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(w_2\\), a schematic world \\(w_1 \\cap w_2\\) is one at which all and\nonly the states of affairs obtain, which obtain both at \\(w_1\\) and at\n\\(w_2\\). Dually, a “superposed” or inconsistent world\n\\(w_1 \\cup w_2\\) is one at which all and only the states of affairs\nobtain, which obtain at \\(w_1\\) or at \\(w_2\\). Rescher and\nBrandom’s inconsistent-superposed worlds are, therefore,\nimpossible worlds of the fourth kind: Contradiction Realizers making\nboth \\(A\\) and its negation true, for some \\(A\\) (just superpose, for\ninstance, a possible world, \\(w_1\\), at which I am 1.70m tall, and\nanother possible world, \\(w_2\\), at which I am 1.90m tall). \nThe assignment of truth values at such worlds is not (obviously)\ncompositional with respect to conjunction. The standard semantic\nclause interprets the ‘\\(\\wedge\\)’ symbol using our world\n‘and’: \nBut the right-to-left direction will have to go, if \\(w\\) is one\nof Rescher and Brandom’s impossible worlds. These worlds are\nnonadjunctive: they allow two sentences to be true even\nthough their conjunction is not true. (Adjunction is the\nprinciple that the truth of a conjunction follows from the truth of\nits conjuncts.) Rescher and Brandom’s worlds can also be\nnonprime: a disjunction may hold at them even though neither\ndisjunct does. They may also make some \\(A\\) and its negation\n\\(\\neg A\\) both true. But the corresponding conjunction,\n\\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\), doesn’t follow. These impossible\nworlds retain a certain amount of logical structure. They are closed\nunder any classically valid, essentially single-premised inference\n(such as Disjunction Introduction); but they are not closed\nunder essentially multiple-premised inferences (such as\nAdjunction). \nRescher and Brandom’s approach falls in the nonadjunctive tradition\n(see Berto 2007, Chapter 6) of\n paraconsistent logics:\n a tradition started by Jaskowksi’s discussive logic\n\\(\\mathbf{D}_2\\) (also labeled as \\(\\mathbf{J}\\) in the literature), and\nbased on the idea of rejecting or limiting the Adjunction principle.\nSuch an approach has been revived in works by Hyde (1997), and Varzi\n(1997 and 2004). \nTo model a concept such as knowledge, we can use a modality\n‘\\(K\\)’ for ‘knows that’, with semantics\nalong the lines of ‘\\(\\Box\\)’, quantifying over all\nepistemically possible worlds: worlds which are ways things could be,\nfor all one knows, or given the information or evidence one has\navailable. This is epistemic modal logic. (See the entry on\n epistemic logic\n for background material.) \nThis approach has proved to be very useful. However, when\nepistemically possible worlds confirm to the rules of logically\npossible worlds, the following principle is valid: \n(Closure) If \\(KA\\) and \\(A\\) entails \\(B\\), then \\(KB\\)\n \nThis principle says that one knows all the logical consequences of the\nthings one knows. A special case of this principle says that all valid\nformulas are known: \n(Validity) If \\(A\\) is valid, then so is \\(KA\\)\n \nBut these principles seem false. You don’t know all the logical and\nmathematical truths, and there are truths which follow from what you\nknow which you don’t know. (You might be indifferent to those truths;\nyou might even disbelieve them.) This is the problem of logical\nomniscience (see\n epistemic logic\n again). There is a rich literature on the problem (Alechina et al.\n2004, Duc 1997, Hintikka 1975, Jago 2014a,b, Rantala 1982a), including\nsome who defend these seemingly false principles (Stalnaker 1991,\n1999). \nExactly the same holds for belief (treated with a modality\n‘\\(B\\)’ along the lines of ‘\\(K\\)’).\nThe modal epistemic approach tells us that, as well as believing all\nconsequences of what we believe, we must hold a perfectly consistent\nset of beliefs: \n(Consistency) \\(\\vDash \\neg(BA \\wedge B\\neg A)\\).\n \nThis is a hard principle to defend, as anyone who has reflected on\ntheir own beliefs will appreciate. \nA popular method of avoiding these principles (beginning with\nCresswell 1973 and Hintikka 1975) is to allow impossible worlds into\nthe account. Consider again Rescher and Brandom’s nonadjunctive and\nnonprime worlds, at which conjunction and disjunction behave\nanarchically. Rantala (1982a) takes the idea further, introducing\nworlds at which any connective may behave anarchically. \nRantala’s approach divides the worlds into normal and\nnon-normal ones. Normal worlds behave like possible worlds\nwhereas at non-normal worlds, every sentence is assigned an\narbitrary truth value. In effect, complex sentences \\(\\neg A, A \\vee\nB\\), and so on, are treated as if they were atomic sentences. The\ntruth value of \\(\\neg A\\) is independent of \\(A\\); the value of \\(A\n\\vee B\\) is independent of the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) at a\nnon-normal world; and so on for the other complex sentences. These\nnon-normal worlds are thus a very anarchic form of impossible\nworld. Priest (2005, 2016) calls them\nopen worlds, since they are not closed under any rule of\ninference (other than the trivial rule allowing one to infer\n\\(A\\) from \\(A\\); see also Jago 2014a). \nLogical consequence and validity are defined with respect to possible\n(normal) worlds only. Impossible worlds come into play only when\nevaluating knowledge claims, \\(KA\\). So, ignoring\n\\(K\\)-sentences, the logic is classical. But the logic of\n\\(K\\)-sentences is not closed under any non-trivial rule of\ninference, thereby dispensing with Closure, Validity, and (in the case\nof belief) Consistency. An agent is modelled as having inconsistent\nbeliefs, for example, simply by treating an impossible world where\nboth \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are true as being epistemically\naccessible (from the actual world) for that agent. \nThe approach has been generalized to quantified modal logics (Rantala\n1982b) and developed into a unified framework for epistemic logics\n(Wansing 1989, 1990). Wansing has shown that various logics for\nknowledge and belief developed in Artificial Intelligence can find\nequivalent models in structures including impossible worlds. Further\nequivalence results in this area have been obtained in Sillari 2008,\nwhere it is shown that impossible worlds structures using binary\nepistemic accessibility relations are equivalent to structures using\nMontague-Scott neighborhood semantics. \nThis kind of approach faces problems, however. If there’s no logical\nstructure to impossible worlds, then we might do as well to model an\nagent’s knowledge using an arbitrary set of sentences, as in Konolige\n1986. The worry is that unconstrained impossible worlds semantics\nmakes no real progress over this purely syntactic approach (Jago 2007,\n2009). \nOne may instead adopt impossible worlds that retain some\nlogical structure, e.g., worlds closed under some\nweaker-than-classical logical consequence. One approach of this kind\nis found in Levesque 1984 (see also Cresswell 1973). This employs\nimpossible worlds of the kind used in paraconsistent relevant logics,\nwhich can be locally inconsistent and incomplete but are well-behaved\nwith respect to conjunction and disjunction, that is, they are\nadjunctive and prime. Laws of classical logic fail at them, and by\naccessing them a cognitive agent can have inconsistent beliefs.\nHowever, we still have a weakened form of logical omniscience: the\nbeliefs of an agent are closed under the weaker\nparaconsistent-relevant logic at issue. This seems incorrect as an\nattempt to model finite agents. \nRasmussen 2015 and Bjerring and Skipper (forthcoming) present a\ndynamic impossible worlds solution to the logical omniscience\nproblem. Agents’ beliefs evolve over time due to epistemic\nactions, on this approach (see the entry on\n dynamic epistemic logic\n for background). Bjerring and Skipper focus on deductive\nactions. Agents count as competent insofar as they unfold the\nconsequences of their beliefs, up to a certain depth of reasoning.\nTheir operator “\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\)”, says:\n“After some \\(n\\)-step chain of logical reasoning, the agent\ncomes to know that \\(A\\)”. The agent can update its epistemic\nstate by kicking out choices of impossible worlds which were epistemic\npossibilities before the deduction took place. One can show that if a\nformula \\(A\\) follows from formulas \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) in \\(n\\)\nsteps of reasoning, then \\(KA_1, \\ldots, KA_n\\) together entail\n\\(\\langle n\\rangle KA\\). \n\n Relevance logic\n (or relevant logic) is an attempt to capture the idea that good\nreasoning requires a genuine condition between premises and\nconclusions. This should go beyond a mere guarantee of truth\npreservation. For when a conclusion \\(A\\) is guaranteed to be\ntrue (for example, when it is a logical truth), any argument\nconcluding in \\(A\\) will preserve truth from premises to\nconclusions. But those premises may have no genuine connection\nwhatsoever to what \\(A\\) is about. The same consideration applies\nwhen taking a conditional \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) to be valid:\nthere should be a genuine connection between \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\). \nWith this in mind, relevance logic attempts to avoid the\n‘fallacies of relevance’ (also called ‘paradoxes of\nthe material conditional’). These are conditionals that are\nvalid in classical and modal logic, simply because the antecedent is a\nnecessary falsehood or the consequent is a necessary truth, but\nwithout a guarantee of any real connection between them. Examples\ninclude \\(A \\wedge \\neg A \\rightarrow B\\) (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet, or the Law of Explosion), \\(A\n\\rightarrow B \\vee \\neg B\\), and \\(A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow B)\\)\n(verum ex quolibet). \nContradiction-realizing impossible worlds can help us avoid ex\ncontradictione quodlibet, if they are worlds where some\ncontradiction \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) is true but some other\n\\(B\\) is not true. For that reason, various systems of relevant\nlogic have been given semantics which include (things naturally\nthought of as) impossible worlds. \nA Routley-Meyer interpretation (see Routley & Routley\n1972; Routley & Meyer 1973, 1976; Routley 1979) for relevant\n(propositional) logics is a structure \\(\\langle W, N,\nR, {}^*, v\\rangle\\), where \\(W\\) is a set of worlds;\n\\(N\\) is a proper subset of \\(W\\) including the normal or\npossible worlds (the remaining worlds are the non-normal or impossible\nworlds); \\(R\\) is a ternary accessibility relation\nbetween worlds, and \\({}^*\\) (the Routley star) is a function from\nworlds to worlds. \\({}^*\\) and \\(R\\) figure prominently in the truth\nconditions for negation and the (relevant) conditional. Their task is\nprecisely to provide a semantics for negation that allows for the\ntruth of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) at some worlds, and a\nsemantics for the conditional that frees it from the fallacies of\nrelevance. \nIn order to get rid of such entailments as \\(A \\rightarrow \n(B \\rightarrow B)\\), we need some world at which \\(A\\)\nholds but \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) fails. One way to achieve this\nmay be to admit “partial” or incomplete situations of the\nkind studied in\n situation semantics,\n at which \\(A\\) holds but \\(B \\rightarrow B\\) fails to\nhold, just because they carry no information about \\(B\\). Another\nway is via impossible worlds: an understanding of such worlds, as we\nhave seen, is as scenarios where logical laws may fail, and the Law of\n(propositional) Identity, stating that any formula entails itself, is\none of them. At possible worlds, we still require for the truth of\nconditionals \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) that at every accessible\nworld where \\(A\\) holds, \\(B\\) holds, too. Consequently,\n\\(A \\rightarrow(B \\rightarrow B)\\) is not logically\nvalid. Technically, when \\(w\\) is an impossible world, we state\nthe truth conditions for the conditional, by means of the ternary\n\\(R\\), as follows: \nThe key difference between \\((\\rightarrow)\\) and the standard modal clause for\nthe strict conditional (which is true at a world if and only if, at\nall accessible worlds where the antecedent is true, the consequent is\ntrue), is that the worlds of the antecedent and the consequent have\nbeen “split”. Specifically, \\(B \\rightarrow B\\)\nfails at impossible worlds \\(w\\) when there are worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) such that\nR\\(ww_1 w_2, B\\)\nholds at the former, but fails at the latter. Since we do not want\n\\(B \\rightarrow B\\) to fail at normal/possible worlds, we can\nadd a Normality Condition, saying that the accessible worlds\n\\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\) are one and the\nsame: \nUsing the ternary relation \\(R\\), one can build models for\ndifferent relevant logics. Starting with the basic relevant system\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\), one obtains models for stronger logics such as \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), the\nsystem of relevant implication, by adding additional conditions on\n\\(R\\). (This is similar to the way we may move on from basic\nmodal logic \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) to the systems \\(\\mathbf{T}, \\mathbf{S4}\\), and\n\\(\\mathbf{S5}\\), by adding extra conditions on the accessibility relation.)\nThe constraints to be added to the ternary \\(R\\) are more complex\nthan those of standard modal logic and some involve the star operator\n\\({}^*\\) (which we’ll address shortly). \nIt isn’t easy to provide an intuitive reading for the ternary relation\n\\(R\\). The basic idea is that the truth of an entailment\n\\(A \\rightarrow B\\) at a world \\(w\\) depends on\n\\(w\\)’s “seeing an accessibility” (Bremer 2005: 67)\nbetween two other worlds \\(w_1\\) and\n\\(w_2\\), such that if \\(A\\) is true at the former,\n\\(B\\) is true at the latter. But what does this mean? This is\nperhaps the most important philosophical issue facing semantics for\nrelevant logics. One approach is the information-based account of\nMares (2004, 2009, 2010) and (Restall 1995b), based on\n situation semantics.\n Another approach draws on various interpretations of\nconditionality, such as those found in the literature on\nconditional logics (Beall et al. 2012). (See the entry on\n relevance logic\n or Jago 2013c for further discussion.)  \nGiven a world \\(w\\), the Routley star function outputs a world\n\\(w^*\\) which is, in a sense, its “reverse twin”. The\ntruth conditions for negation within the Routley-Meyer semantics\nare: \nSo \\(\\neg A\\) is true at a world \\(w\\) if and only if\n\\(A\\) is false, not at \\(w\\) itself (as it happens with\nstandard negation), but at its twin \\(w^*\\). Relevant negation is\ntherefore an intensional operator: in order to evaluate\nnegated sentences at \\(w\\), we may need to check the goings on at\nsome other world. \nAdding appropriate constraints provides this negation with many\nintuitive inferential features. If \\(w^{**} = w\\) for all\nworlds \\(w\\), for example, Double Negation introduction and\nelimination is valid. This is often called De Morgan\nnegation, for De Morgan’s Laws hold of it. But it does not validate\nthe Law of Explosion (that a contradiction entails any sentence). For\na counterexample, take a model where \\(A\\) holds at \\(w,\nB\\) doesn’t hold at \\(w\\), and \\(A\\) doesn’t hold at\n\\(w^*\\). Then, both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold at\n\\(w\\), whereas \\(B\\) doesn’t: \\(w\\) is an inconsistent\nbut non-trivial world. \nWhat is the intuitive connection between \\(w\\) and \\(w^*\\)?\nThe idea is that the twins are “mirror images one of the other\nreversing ‘in’ and ‘out’” (Dunn 1986:\n191). If \\(w\\) is \\(A\\)-inconsistent (both \\(A\\) and\n\\(\\neg A\\) hold), then \\(w^*\\) is \\(A\\)-incomplete\n(neither \\(A\\) nor \\(\\neg A\\) hold), and vice versa. The \\({}^*\\)\ntakes local inconsistency into local incompleteness and vice versa. It\nmay also be the case that \\(w = w^*\\): the twins are in\nfact one. In that case, \\(w\\) must be a maximal and consistent\nworld, where negation behaves classically: \\(\\neg A\\) is true if\nand only if \\(A\\) is false there. \nThis last section discusses some difficulties for impossible worlds\ntheories.  \nSuppose that the expression ‘at world \\(w\\)’ works as\na restricting modifier: its main task consists in restricting the\nquantifiers within its scope to parts of \\(w\\) (Lewis 1986). If\nso, then it should distribute through the truth-functional\nconnectives. This means in particular that \nwill entail the contradiction  \nThis is the exportation principle. It is disastrous for any\ntheory of impossible worlds. It implies that an inconsistency at some\nimpossible world will spill over into an overt inconsistency. A true\ncontradiction at some \\(w\\) implies that there are true\ncontradictions, full stop. This is hard to swallow, unless one is a\ndialetheist. (And even\n dialethists\n may want to reject the exportation principle for impossible worlds:\nsee Jago 2013b.) \nAvoiding the exportation principle is not difficult, however (Kiourti\n2010, Chapter 4; Jago 2013b). For it to be valid, it seems to require\ngenuine worlds, as in Lewis’s (1986) genuine modal realism or\nYagisawa’s (1988, 2010) extended modal realism. Adopting an\nersatz conception of worlds blocks the principle. If a world\nrepresents that \\(A\\) (say, by containing a sentence or proposition\nexpressing that A), but is not in itself such that \\(A\\),\nthen the principle is blocked. ‘At \\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg\nA)\\)’ will be interpreted as: \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or\nproposition) that A \\(\\wedge \\neg A\\), whereas ‘at \\(w:\nA\\)’ will mean that \\(w\\) contains the sentence (or proposition)\nthat A, and ‘not at \\(w: A\\)’ will\nmean that \\(w\\) does not contain the sentence (or proposition)\nthat A. But an impossible world may contain both, or neither,\nof \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), so that containing one implies\nnothing about containing the other. An impossible world may (depending\non how fine-grained we take them to be) also contain the conjunction\n\\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) independently of whether it contains\nboth \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A.\\) So the inference from ‘at\n\\(w: (A \\wedge \\neg A)\\)’ to ‘(at\n\\(w: A) \\wedge \\neg\\)(at \\(w: A)\\)’\nis blocked (possibly twice over).  \nIt is controversial whether any genuine account of worlds can block the\nexportation principle. Jago 2013a,b argues not; Yagisawa 2015 responds\nin defence of genuine impossible worlds. \nIf there are impossible worlds, then we cannot accept the simple\nclause for possibility: \nOnce impossible worlds enter the stage, (P) becomes false from right\nto left. We therefore need a principle that restricts the\nquantification in the right half of the biconditional to\npossible worlds. How to do that, without appealing to modal\nnotions, is not straightforward. The hybrid account (Berto 2010) has\nthe advantage here. If possible worlds are all and only the genuine\nones, with impossible worlds as ersatz constructions of some kind,\nthen we can capture the intent of (P) as: \nNote that it doesn’t matter if the hybrid account accepts the\nexistence of ersatz possible worlds in addition to her genuine\npossible worlds: (P\\({}^*\\)) will still give the right result. \nThe ersatzist may respond by biting the bullet. Even without admitting\nimpossible worlds, most possible worlds accounts do not aim at\nproviding a reductive and complete analysis of modality.\n(Lewis’s modal realism does. But it may not succeed, when\nso-called ‘alien’ properties, not instantiated by anything\nat the actual world nor obtainable as constructions out of actually\ninstantiated properties, enter the stage. See Divers 2002, Chapter 7;\nDivers & Melia 2002.)  \nStalnaker (1996) argues that, whilst there is nothing wrong in\nadmitting impossible worlds, not much explanatory work can be expected\nfrom them. For instance, if one takes worlds as sets of propositions,\nthen one cannot then analyze propositions as sets of worlds. But the\nsame point can be made against any account of possible worlds (such as\nAdams’s) that takes them to be maximally consistent sets of\npropositions. And, just as ersatz possible worlds needn’t be\nconstructed in this way, nor need ersatz impossible worlds. Impossible\nworlds have found many uses in the recent literature, as we have\nabundantly seen. So we don’t find Stalnaker’s worry\nconvincing. \nThe standard semantic clause for negation has it that \\(\\neg A\\)\nis true if and only if \\(A\\) is not true. So there could not be\nworlds at which both or neither of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are\ntrue, unless we revise the semantics of negation. Stalnaker (1996)\nargues that negation is such a basic operator, whose semantics is\n‘learned in a first logic class’ that it had better be\nleft alone.  \nTo this, the impossible world theorist can reply that it is in fact\nthe case that \\(\\neg A\\) is true if and only if \\(A\\) is not\ntrue; for this concerns truth simpliciter, that is, truth at\nthe actual world. She may also agree that the same holds for any\npossible world. But it is precisely impossible worlds that we\nare talking about here; how negation works at any possible world need\nnot be affected by the fact that, at some impossible world or other,\nsome sentence can hold together with its negation: this is one of the\nthings that makes them impossible, after all.  \nTimothy Williamson (2007, Chapter 5) has objected to non-trivial\ntreatments of counterpossibles, in particular (though not perforce)\nwhen they resort to impossible worlds. Consider the claim:  \nPrima facie, this is a non-trivially true counterpossible.\nHowever, Williamson argues, other non-trivial consequences of the\nsupposition would then be that \\(5 + 5 = 11\\), and \\(5 + 4 = 10\\), and\n… , and \\(0 = 1\\). Therefore,  \nBut (2) is clearly false.  \nBrogaard & Salerno (2007) pose a dilemma for Williamson: either we\nhold the context fixed in this kind of counterpossible reasoning, or\nwe don’t. If we don’t, then (2) does not follow from (1).\nIn particular, the context at which (2) comes out false is one at\nwhich the closest antecedent worlds are possible and, to be sure, at\nthose worlds, 0 is not 1. But if we hold the context fixed, then what\ndoes follow is just the following counterpossible:  \nNow this is intuitively true, and non-trivially so.  \nWilliamson (2007) also argues that non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles create opaque contexts, in which the substitutivity\nof co-referential terms fails. Supporters of non-trivial\ncounterpossibles will take the following conditional as false:  \nGiven the necessity of identity, (4) is a counterpossible: as Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, its antecedent can only be true at impossible worlds.\nThat’s false, supposedly, because even if Hesperus and\nPhosphorus had been distinct, Phosphorus would have remained\nself-identical. However, all accept that \nsince it is an instance of ‘if it had been that \\(A\\), then\nit would have been that \\(A\\)’. Yet substituting\n‘Phosphorus’ for the first occurrence of\n‘Hesperus’ in the consequent of (5) gives (4). Since (5)\nis true and (4) is (supposedly) false, substitution of identicals has\nfailed. This failure of substitutivity, Williamson claims, is a bad\nresult, for counterfactuals should not create opaque\ncontexts.  \nBrogaard and Salerno (2013) accept that counterpossibles do create\nopaque contexts. They argue that the impossible worlds similarity\nsemantics for counterpossibles should be “partially\nepistemic” (Brogaard & Salerno 2013: 654), and this\nepistemic component explains the failure of substitution. \nAn alternative reply to Williamson is that the objection is\nquestion-begging. It is clearly false that counterfactuals allow\nsubstitution of identical terms (of any type). ‘Had Aristotle\nnever taught, Aristotle would still have been Aristotle’ is\ntrue, and Aristotle is the teacher of Alexander, yet ‘had\nAristotle never taught, Aristotle would still have been the teacher of\nAlexander’ is clearly false. The substitution principle must be\nrestricted to rigid designators: terms that denote the same\nentity in all metaphysically possible worlds. But one may\nthen reply: what’s so special about the class of metaphysically\npossible worlds, when it comes to evaluating counterfactuals? It seems\nquestion-begging (against an account in terms of both possible and\nimpossible worlds) to insist the metaphysically possible worlds play a\nspecial role here. (Note that if we consider terms that are rigid with\nrespect to the nomically possible worlds, or to all worlds, then no\nproblem arises for the account.)  \nBerto et al. 2018 is an extensive discussion of a number of\nWilliamsonian objections to non-trivial treatments of\ncounterpossibles. \nCompositionality is the principle that the meaning or content\nof a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its\nconstituent expressions. It’s commonly taken to be a mandatory\nfeature of any adequate theory of meaning and content. The argument is\nthat, as competent speakers of a language, we are in principle capable\nof grasping the meanings of a potentially infinite number of\nsentences. And since we’ve learnt the meanings of a limited\nnumber of words, this is possible only if the meanings of complex\nsentences are obtainable recursively from the meanings of their\nconstituent parts (Davidson 1965).  \nThe worry is that a theory of meaning or content which includes\nimpossible worlds will not be compositional. Consider what we said\nabove about the exportation principle (Section 6.1) and the semantics\nof negation (Section 6.4). An impossible world may represent that\n\\(\\neg A\\) independently of whether it represents that\n\\(A\\). But then, for such worlds, the truth-value of\n\\(\\neg A\\) is not a function of the truth-value of \\(A\\).\nSo, the worry goes, the content or proposition that \\(\\neg A\\),\nunderstood as a set of possible and impossible worlds, will not be a\nfunction of the proposition that \\(A\\). (Certainly, the latter is\nnot the set-theoretic complement of the former, as it is on the\npossible worlds account.) The same goes for all the other logically\ncomplex sentences. This is perhaps the most serious objection to the\nimpossible worlds approach. If it can’t be met, it may well be\nfatal. \nTo address the worry, defenders of impossible worlds must show that\ntheir notion of content is compositional. Note that that’s\nnot obviously the same as giving compositional\ntruth-conditions for the connectives and operators. An impossible\nworlds account can’t do the latter in a uniform way, for at least some\ntruth-conditions (as necessary truths) will not be respected by some\nimpossible worlds. \nThe only attempt we know of to address the compositionality worry is\nBerto and Jago 2019, Chapter 8. They view impossible worlds as sets of\nsentences (of some ‘worldmaking’ language), where those\nsentences have a compositional structure. They then argue that, given\nany semantic content, a grammatical structure can be recovered and\nanalysed in terms of the syntactic structure of the underlying\nworldmaking sentences. Whether this provides an acceptable notion of\ncompositionality (as they claim) remains to be seen.  \nUndoubtedly, other objections to impossible worlds can and are likely\nto be raised. The current debate on impossible worlds appears to be at\nthe same stage as the one on possible worlds was, some forty\nyears ago. At that time, people struggled to make sense of the concept\nof a possible world. Many declared it meaningless. Nowadays, the\nvariety of its applications has placed the notion firmly at the core\nof much philosophical and logical practice (see e.g., Divers 2002,\nChapter 4). Impossible worlds may undergo the same fate, should they\nprove as useful as they appear to be in the treatment of\nimpossibilities of various kinds.","contact.mail":"mark.jago@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"}]
