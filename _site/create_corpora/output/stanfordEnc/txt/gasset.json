In the\ncourse of his career as philosopher, social theorist, essayist,\ncultural and aesthetic critic, educator, politician and editor of the\ninfluential journal, Revista de Occidente, he has written on\na broad range of themes and issues. Among his many books are:\nMeditations on Quixote (1914), Invertebrate Spain\n(1921), The Theme of Our Time (1923), Ideas on the\nNovel (1925), The Dehumanization of Art (1925), What\nis Philosophy? (1929), The Revolt of the Masses (1930),\nEn Torno a Galileo [Man and Crisis] (1933),\nHistory as a System (1935), Man and People\n(1939–40), The Origin of Philosophy (1943), The\nIdea of Principle in Leibnitz and the Evolution of Deductive\nTheory (1948). In addition to these books, he also wrote hundreds\nof essays and newspaper and magazine articles, the most important of\nwhich are collected in twelve volumes, several of which have been\ntranslated into English, French and German. His major writings reveal\nan intellectual development that traversed the life-world experiences\narticulated in the perspectives of phenomenology, historicism and\nexistentialism.\n\n\nOrtega's perception of human life as fundamental reality and as a\n“happening”, his analysis of the ontological distinction\nbetween “being” and “authentic being”, his\ndescription of the intersubjective interaction of the “I”\nand “Others” in the social world, his concepts of\n“generation”, “contemporaries” and\n“co-evals”, and his ideas of “perspectivism”,\n“vital” and “historical reason”, all combine\nto broaden and advance his philosophy of human social and historical\nrealities. Through these intellectual orientations, Ortega became\nconcerned with the epistemological status of historical knowledge, and\napproached the critical philosophy of history as the interpenetration\nof philosophical and historical attitudes. Critical philosophy of\nhistory thus refers to the position that characterizes the world we\nknow and in which we act as a product of human activity and mind.\nAccordingly, Ortega represented the “modern” reflective\nthinker who approached history from philosophy, and whose theories of\nhistory as a source of human knowledge have epitomized the tendency to\nconnect concepts of historical temporality and mind. He challenged\npositivist approaches to history and contributed an important aspect\nto the modern concept of history: the tenet that there is connection\nand meaning in human history which emanates from a principle of\ncontinuity inherent in individual human lives.\n\nJosé Ortega y Gasset was born on May 9, 1883, in Madrid, the\nsecond of four children by José Ortega Munilla and Dolores\nGasset Chinchilla. Eduardo Ortega y Gasset, his brother, was born in\nApril 1882, and after José, Rafaela in 1884 and Manuel in 1885.\nHis mother was the daughter of Eduardo Gasset y Artime, founder of\nEl Imparcial, the eminent liberal daily newspaper; Ortega\ndivided his time between creative writing and serving as the editor of\nthe family enterprise from 1900 to 1906. From September 1891 to 1897,\nOrtega and his brother Eduardo were enrolled in the Jesuit Collegio de\nSan Estanislao de Kostka in Miraflores del Palo in Málaga,\nwhere he studied Greek and other subjects under the tutelage of Father\nGonzalo Colomer and received his bachillerato. In November\n1897, young Ortega enrolled in the Jesuit University of Deusto, in\nBilbao, accompanied by Father Colomer, for the purpose of studying\nphilology and Greek under the renowned scholar Julio Cejador y Frauca.\nHe remained in Deusto, studying philosophy, letters, and law, until\nMay 13, 1898, when he was awarded distinction in his first-year\nexaminations at the University of Salamanca. Miguel de Unamuno, an\neminent figure in Spanish intellectual circles and dean of the\nfaculty, served on the panel of examiners. The following year, Ortega\ntransferred to the Central University of Madrid from which he received\nhis licenciatura in philosophy and letters in June 1902, and\nhis doctorate in December 1904. He wrote his thesis on The Terrors\nof the Year One Thousand in which an early interest in a general\ninterpretive approach to history, with a view toward the sociological\nmanifestations of a historical period, became evident. While at the\nCentral University of Madrid, Ortega developed a close friendship with\nRamiro de Maeztu with whom he shared an enthusiasm for Nietzsche's\nphilosophy. In 1904, the year prior to his departure for Germany,\nOrtega wrote his first article for the El Imparcial, the\nfamily newspaper, on the Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck. \nIn late February 1905, Ortega left Spain for Germany\n“fleeing”, he described later, “the vulgarity of my\ncountry to stuff myself with whatever I can get out of it”\n(El Imparcial, 19 January, 1908, p. 1; Obras, X:\n24). This first trip to Germany resulted in an eight-month stay at the\nUniversity of Leipzig where he pursued the study of classical\nphilology and philosophy. Ortega's proficiency in German proved\ninadequate to study philology, but this linguistic deficiency did not\ndeter his enthusiasm: he enrolled in the Indo-European language and\nlinguistic courses taught by professors Brugmann and Meyer. Although\nthe time devoted to philological studies somewhat distracted him from\nthe philosophical training he sought initially, Ortega was introduced\nto the writings of Wilhelm von Humboldt, Ernest Renan, Hippolyte\nTaine, Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Charles Darwin,\nand audited anatomy, physiology and psychology courses of Wilhelm\nWundt who, despite having been appointed the chair of philosophy,\nserved as professor of physiology and psychology at Leipzig. He\nreturned to Madrid in the summer of 1906, where he received word that\nhe had been granted a state stipend to resume his study in Germany for\nanother year. Within a few weeks, he left for the University of\nBerlin, where Wilhelm Dilthey, Friedrich Paulsen, Eduard Meyer,\nHeinrich Wölfflin, Georg Simmel, Carl Stumpf, Max Planck, and\nAlois Riehl were teaching. However, Ortega only attended Riehl's\nlectures while in Berlin, which he later came to regret as he missed\nthe opportunity to encounter two thinkers he would subsequently\nadmire: Dilthey and Simmel. Six months later, Ortega left Berlin for\nthe University of Marburg, where he began his philosophical studies,\njoining Nicolai Hartmann, Paul Scheffer, and Heinz Heimsoeth under the\nNeo-Kantian philosophers Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp. Once ensconced\nin “the citadel of Neo-Kantianism” (Obras, VIII:\n32), Ortega studied Kant and the history of philosophy with Cohen and\npsychology and pedagogy with Natorp. The University of Marburg, with\nits inquiry into the logical foundation of the natural sciences and\nits emphasis on the epistemological and methodological facets of\nphilosophy, provided Ortega with the kind of philosophical grounding\nand training he had been seeking. \nIn February 1908, Ortega returned to Madrid where his appointment to\nthe staff of El Imparcial and his founding Faro, a\nweekly magazine, became the first of several publishing ventures. They\nserved as the vehicle through which he conveyed his critical\nassessment of Spanish and European cultures. Upon his departure for\nGermany in 1905, the dominant intellectual issue among the\nintelligentsia had been the regeneration of Spain and the fundamental\nquestion, “what is to be done: ‘Hispanization or\nEuropeanization?’” Upon his return in 1908, the question\nremained the central theme of protracted discussions, the only\naddition being the critical ideas of Ortega. In a 1908 issue of\nFaro, the Conservative historian and politician Gabriel Maura\ny Gamazo (1879–1963) first coined the designation\n“Generation of 1898”, which was popularized by the\nnovelist Azorín (José Martínez Ruíz,\n1873–1967), a member of the group, in subsequent newspaper\narticles in 1910 and 1913. On February 23, 1908, Maura engaged in\npolemical exchanges with Ortega and referred to “the generation\nthat arrives today; a generation born intellectually at the root of\nthe disaster” (Obras, X: 31–38). The Generation\nof 1898 acquired their name as the events of the Spanish American War\nunfolded, which presented the perception of national catastrophe and\nprovided a context for their national and social criticisms. Spaniards\nperceived the war as a national disaster, and the Generation of 1898\ncame together to discuss what they considered to be the degeneration\nof Spain. \nIn June 1908 Ortega was appointed professor of ethics, logic and\npsychology at La Escuela Superior del Magisterio (Normal School),\nwhich he had helped found. In late October, at the Assembly for the\nProgress of Science held in Zaragoza, he spoke vehemently in favor of\nregenerating Spain by broadening her horizons within European thought.\nOrtega pursued these issues with his former professor of Greek at the\nUniversity of Salamanca, Unamuno, but reproached him for preferring to\n“Africanize” Europe than to “Europeanize”\nSpain, a conviction that led to a parting of ways the following year\n(Obras, I: 64). On October 8, 1910, in an open competition,\nOrtega appeared before a jury established to select a successor to the\nchair of metaphysics, left vacant after the death of Nicolás\nSalmerón (1838–1908). A month later, he received the\nprofessorship at the Central University of Madrid, at the remarkable\nage of twenty-seven. Six months earlier, on April 7, 1910, Ortega\nmarried his fiancée, Rosa Spottorno y Topete, and from January\nto October 1911, the couple spent a delayed honeymoon in Germany,\nassisted by a grant issued through the Ministry of Public Education\nfor further study and research. His first son, Miguel Germán,\nwas born in Marburg on May 28, 1911. The symbolic name reveals the\nimportance of Germany for Ortega. At the end of December 1911, Ortega\nreturned to Madrid to assume his teaching duties, and in January 1912,\ntook up the position of professor of metaphysics, a chair he occupied\nfor twenty-four years, with only two brief interruptions: once in\n1929, when he resigned to protest the encroachments on academic\nfreedom during the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera; and again,\nin 1931, when Ortega become one of the first members of the\nConstituent Cortes at the beginning of the second Spanish Republic\nuntil he was exiled from Spain at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil\nWar in 1936. \nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Ortega began to contribute to\nthe “European cultural mission” of Spain through his\nlectures on some of the major trends within the currents of European\nthought. Biological thoughts of Hans Driesch, August Weissmann, and\nJakob von Uexküll, and the philosophical, economic and social\nthoughts of Max Scheler, Georg Simmel and Werner Sombart were\nintroduced to Spanish university students for the first time. In July\n1916, Ortega, his father and several other Spanish intellectuals\ndeparted Spain for Argentina where, between August and October, Ortega\ngave a series of lectures at the University of Buenos Aires on Kant\nand the currents in contemporary Continental philosophy. These\nlectures followed the recent arrival of Julio Rey Pastor, a noted\nSpanish mathematician, who immigrated to Argentina to elevate the\nmathematical and scientific level of instruction at the University of\nBuenos Aires. Ortega's residence in Buenos Aires kept him away from\npolitical affairs, save for an article in June 1917 in which he\ncriticized the role of the military in politics. The political\ncommentary precipitated his definitive departure from El\nImparcial and prompted his move with his brother, Eduardo, to\njoin a new daily newspaper El Sol, founded by a close friend,\nNicolás María de Urgoiti of La Papelera Española.\nThe first issue appeared on December 1, 1917. Five years later, Ortega\nalso assisted in establishing the publishing house Calpe (later named\nEspasa-Calpe), which immediately made available Spanish and European\nclassic and contemporary literature in reasonably priced paperback\neditions. Between these activities, Ortega became the founder and\ndirector of the monthly Revista de Occidente, publishing the\nfirst issue in July 1923. The Revista, which was directed\ntoward an educated readership, quickly became one of Europe's renowned\nintellectual journals. The organ became a veritable “Review of\nthe West” as several of the articles, which were translations of\nworks previously published abroad, were important philosophic and\nscientific trends representative of “our epoch”: Spengler,\nHuizinga, Simmel, Uexküll, Brentano, Heimoseth, Driesch,\nPfänder, Müller and Russell. The journal also became the\nprincipal medium of the intelligentsia and, in conjunction with\nOrtega's tertulias in the offices on the Avenue Pi y Margall,\nassisted in fostering the poetic generation of young intellectuals,\nthe “Generation of 1927”. The Generation of 1927\noriginated as a term to characterize a certain similarity of poets and\nwriters in 1920s Spain. The year signaled the moment when\nintellectuals and students began to resist the dictatorship of General\nMiguel Primo de Rivera as a prelude to the Second Republic. As with\ntheir predecessors, the Generation of 1898, the perceived national\ncrisis created a spirit of collective mentality, or at least a shared\nidentity, in the years preceding the Spanish Civil War. Several of the\nyounger vanguard poets were first published by Índice,\nfounded and directed by Juan Ramón Jiménez\nMantecón (1881–1958), a nineteenth-century follower of\nKarl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781–1832), who had been one of\nthe first to reintroduce modernist themes in Spanish literature. Other\nmembers of the Generation of 1927 found expression through the\nRevista de Occidente. Ortega, whose major works were\npublished in the 1920s, served as one of the most important links\nbetween the two generations by giving editorial assistance to the\nyounger poets and addressing The Dehumanization of Art (1925)\nto their concerns. Along with Américo Castro (1885–1972),\nRamón Pérez de Ayala (1880–1962), and Eugenio\nd'Ors y Rovira (1882–1954), he provided an intellectual\nleadership that inspired the younger Spaniards to develop fully their\nown creative endeavors. \nThese young artists and poets were marking their careers on the crest\nof a new wave that swept intellectual circles in Europe and Spain.\nPolitics appeared to pursue culture and art. As these young poets and\nartists matured and identified with the Generation of 1927, they\nbecame more daring and willing to experiment with new techniques and\nmedia to produce a much wider vivid impact. Federico García\nLorca's (1898–1936) friendly collaboration with painter Salvador\nDalí (1904–1989), film director Luis Buñuel\n(1900–1983) and composer Manuel de Falla (1876–1946)\ndemonstrated an appreciation for combining new techniques to extract\nmysterious essences from human experience. Their works offered vivid\nimages of the new abstract aesthetic mysticism and surrealism in the\n1920s. These new art forms and novel methods of perceiving hidden\nessences were immediately associated with the aesthetic expressions\nthat rejected old moralities and traditional values, developed a\ngreater interest in politics and represented an ever-increasing\ncreative sensitivity. Indeed, this new found freedom in aesthetic\nexpression was extended to the realm of politics. In April 1929, after\nOrtega resigned his chair of metaphysics at the Central University of\nMadrid in protest of Primo de Rivera's repressive educational\npolicies, several of these young intellectuals representing diverse\npolitical positions turned to him for political counsel and implored\nhim to guide their reform movement on behalf of a “modern”\nand “intellectual” orientation toward\n“freedom” in Spain. Ortega declined the leadership role\nproposed by García Lorca and the group of young intellectuals\nand offered, instead, his “sympathy, support, and\ncomradeship”. \nIn February 1931, the government summoned municipal elections,\npreparing for the general parliamentary elections. During the same\nperiod, Ortega, together with the physician and writer Gregorio\nMarañón (1887–1960) and the novelist and poet\nPerez de Ayala, published the manifesto of the “Agupación\nal Servicio de la República” (“Group in the Service\nof the Republic”), appealing for an association of intellectuals\nand professionals dedicated to the implementation of the goal that\nwould unite all classes and geographical regions under a national\nbanner. The Agrupación proposed to pursue the path between the\n“dead ends” of Communism and Fascism: a Republic. Ortega's\npolitical vision and intellectual style provided the inspiration and\nleadership sought by La Agrupación and Lorca's intellectual\ncohort after the sudden abdication of Alfonso XIII and the\nproclamation of the Republic on April 14, 1931. Though limited through\nlegal restrictions, La Agrupación supported the platform of\nSocialist Republican candidates. Fourteen members of the group,\nincluding Ortega, Marañón and Ayala, were elected in the\nparliamentary elections in June. Ortega was elected to the Constituent\nCortes in the provinces of León and Jaén; he demitted\nthe latter seat. The election returns revealed that Republican\ncandidates received three times as many votes as the Monarchists. The\nConstituent Cortes convened on July 14, a date chosen consciously to\nsymbolize the Second Republic's identity with the French Revolution of\n1789. The Second Republic, when observed in the broader context of\nEuropean history, was the fifteenth and last of a series of republics\nwhich had been installed during the first decades of the twentieth\ncentury. \nAs a member of the Cortes, Ortega experienced the practical\ndifficulties inherent in the nature of political leadership. Manuel\nAzaña y Díaz (1880–1940), a dominant figure in\ngovernment at the time, and his political following continually\nopposed the ideas and leadership of Ortega and his associates of La\nAgrupación. In the fall of 1932, Ortega left active politics\nwhen communication became virtually impossible due to incessant\narguments and conflicts between the followers of Ortega and\nAzaña. Daunted but not distressed, Ortega returned to his chair\nof metaphysics at the Central University of Madrid. Between the time\nof his return to the university and the outbreak of the Spanish Civil\nWar, Ortega continued writing political articles in El Sol,\nidentifying and criticizing politicians he thought were primarily\nresponsible for veering the Republic in the wrong direction. \nOrtega's acrid comments failed to shield him from the Republic's\npolitical turmoil. Thus, on August 31, 1936, during the early phases\nof the Spanish Civil War, stricken with serious gall bladder issues\nand not knowing what to expect from his political enemies, Ortega, his\nwife, his three children and his brother Eduardo embarked on a French\nboat from Alicante to Merseilles with the assistance of the French\nEmbassy. They settled in La Tronche, near Grenoble, until November\nwhen they moved to Paris where they remained, the winter of 1937 to\nAugust 1939, except for short trips to the Netherlands and Portugal.\nAt the invitation of Johann Huizinga, from late November 1937 to\nFebruary 1938,Ortega presented lectures in Rotterdam, Amsterdam,\nDelft, Leiden and The Hague. After the lectures in the Netherlands,\nOrtega returned to Paris where he underwent a gallbladder operation in\nOctober. In February, 1939, he traveled to the south of Portugal to\nrecuperate from the operation. While in Portugal, Ortega's mother died\non April 21, 1939 in a small town (Puente Genil) near Córdoba;\non November 12 of the following year, his sister, Rafaela, died.\nEventually, at the end of August, Ortega left for Argentina\naccompanied by his wife and daughter. He remained in Argentina during\nthe major part of the Second World War, lecturing at the University of\nBuenos Aires until late February/early March in 1942, when he, his\nwife and daughter settled in Estoril, Portugal. \nIn August 1945, Ortega returned to Spain for the first time since the\noutbreak of the Spanish War. He passed the remainder of the summer in\nZumaya before returning to Portugal for the winter. Ortega's return to\nhis native country in 1945 marked the end of nine years in exile.\nHowever, to several of his Republican compatriots who remained in\nexile, a return to Franco Spain called into question his intellectual\nintegrity. The supporters of Franco, on the other hand, considered him\na former enemy and untrustworthy. Unable to republish issues of the\nRevista de Occidente because of governmental intervention,\nOrtega published extensively in German periodicals. Though his chair\nin metaphysics was officially restored, Ortega never resumed his\nteaching at the university. However, in 1948, with the assistance of\nhis former student and disciple, Julián Marías\n(1914–2005), Ortega established El Instituto de Humanidades\n(“Institute of Humanities”), in Madrid, at which he\nlectured and succeeded in attracting many students and liberal\nintellectuals. Despite its success, the government rarely allowed the\nInstitute to function freely and eventually shut down their activities\nin 1950. \nBetween 1949 and 1955, Ortega avoided the pressure of the Spanish\nGovernment by reactivating his cultural interests in conferences and\nmeetings abroad where he lectured and received honors. In early July\n1949, he visited Aspen, Colorado, with his good friend Ernst R.\nCurtius, the cultural historian, to attend and participate in the\nbicentennial commemoration of Goethe's birth under of the auspices and\ndirection of Robert M. Hutchins and the University of Chicago. In\nSeptember, he visited Hamburg, Berlin, Darmstadt and Munich for\nsimilar reasons. In August 1951, he returned to Germany to participate\nin a conference at Darmstadt (where he met Heidegger) and to receive\nan honorary doctorate from the University of Marburg. The conference,\nwhich Ortega was invited to attend in Darmstadt, was sponsored by\nscientists and architects to discuss “Man and Space”. This\nbrief meeting was apparently pleasant, as neither philosopher broached\nthe sensitive issue of originality or similarities of certain aspects\nof their thought during the course of their private conversations. In\n1951, he received another honorary doctorate from the University of\nGlasgow. Failing health due to stomach and liver cancer curtailed his\ntraveling after his last lecture given in May 1955 at Venice. On\nOctober 18, 1955, in Madrid, Ortega died in his apartment on the sixth\nfloor at Calle Monte Esquinza 28. \nOrtega dissociated himself from any particular school of thought,\nthough he would have been the first to acknowledge that a\nphilosopher's ideas become linked with previous philosophical\ntraditions. His attitude toward this intrinsic aspect of thought\nbecomes apparent when he remarked:  \nIn our present philosophical posture and in the doctrine that is\nproduced by it, we view and take into account a substantial portion of\nprevious thought and themes relating to our discipline. This is\ntantamount to saying that past philosophies are our collaborators,\nwhich survive and are present in our own philosophy. (Obras,\nIX: 360)  \nThe most important and obvious connection between intellectual\ncurrents in Europe and Ortega's thought, then, was the influence of\nGerman philosophy and, in particular, his studies at the University of\nMarburg. Neo-Kantianism in general and Hermann Cohen in particular\nprovided broad influence on the intellectual development of Ortega. He\nstudied closely with both Cohen and Paul Natorp, and the former served\nas Ortega's primary mentor. Ortega recalled this relationship in his\n“Prologue for Germans” (Obras, VIII: 13-58) where\nhe referred to Cohen, in retrospect, as “my teacher”. Some\nof the critical influence of Marburg Neo-Kantianism is discernible in\nOrtega's writings. An attempt to distinguish philosophy from the\nassumptions and assertions—whether idealistic or\npositivistic—of speculative metaphysics characterized his\ngeneral philosophical position. Ortega rejected speculative\nmetaphysical systems and, like Cohen, repudiated natural science's\napproach to epistemology with its naturalistic and psychophysical\nexplanations of sensible reality of the “subjective”\nidealists. Although Ortega hesitates to proceed as far as Cohen, that\nis, to postulate the “facts” of science to be determined\ncompletely by thought, a sort of Neo-Kantian metaphysics remains in\nhis fundamental philosophical point of view. For instead of positing\npure thought as solely real, Ortega replaced Cohen's logic with the\nnotion of “human life”. In other words, Ortega's\ngeneralized view of existence contains human life in place of human\nlogic as the underlying unifying principle of reality. Ortega's major\nwritings were concerned with the idea of life as the “dynamic\ndialogue between the individual and the world”; he was not\nconcerned, as was Cohen, with assigning to external experience a\nreality that is contingent upon the principles of logic and\nmathematical physics. “The structure of life is\nfuturition”, he wrote,  \nthe most persistent leit motif of my writings, inspired\ncertainly by questions—raised by the logic of Cohen—which\nare very remote from the vital problem to which I apply it.\n(Obras, IV: 403–4)  \nThis distinction drawn by Ortega between his vitalistic perspective\nand Cohen's all-embracing logic suggests that Ortega's experience at\nMarburg brought him closer to a critical Neo-Kantianism than to an\nabsolute Neo-Kantianism. The critical approach to philosophical issues\nbecame an important factor in influencing Ortega's thought and in the\nphilosophical training that he received. In his “Reflections on\nKant's Centenary” in 1929, Ortega, in retrospect, referred\nmetaphorically to his struggle with Kant and Neo-Kantian philosophy as\nhaving occurred in a “Kantian prison”, (Obras,\nIV: 25) ; and in his “Prologue for Germans”, he\nacknowledged his experience at the University of Marburg to have been\nan important factor in influencing his intellectual development.\n“In this city”, he reflected, “I passed the equinox\nof my youth; to it I owe half, at least, of my hopes and almost all my\ndiscipline” (Obras, II: 558–59, VIII: 20-21). \nOrtega's return to Marburg in 1911 signaled another turn in his\nintellectual interests and his philosophical development: introduction\nto phenomenology. He recalled in his later writing that, while\nstudying at Marburg during those months, he and his fellow students of\nCohen and Natorp were deeply immersed in Neo-Kantian idealism. Ortega,\nNicolai Hartmann, Heinz Heimsoeth and Paul Scheffer often discussed\namongst themselves their agreements, disagreements, and\ndissatisfaction with the Neo-Kantianism of their mentors. The critical\nspirit of their intellectual “spontaneity” became evident\nin their reactions to all the reading they had undertaken on Kant,\nParmenides, and ancient philosophy in general. In recognizing the\nlimits of the Kantian revival and reflecting upon the current\ntendencies in art, literature and philosophy, Ortega and his\nintellectual cohort proceeded beyond Neo-Kantian idealism toward\n“the imaginary coast”. Like any journey along imaginary\ncoasts, the uncertainty of the horizon demands a nautical device for\nthe means of navigation. For Ortega and his intellectual peers in\nsearch of a system, the intellectual ambiance provided them “the\ngift of a prodigious instrument: phenomenology” (Obras,\nVIII: 20, 42). This “common awakening” of the young\ncohort, however, also signaled their separate paths. In 1911, they, as\na group of students, collectively challenged the positions of their\nteachers; on leaving Marburg, they had to pursue as individuals\nwhatever intellectual autonomy they were able to discover in\nphenomenology, and to put together whichever architectonic of a system\nwas attainable from it. \nAfter 1911, evidence points to how both Ortega and Hartmann pursued\nparticular interests of phenomenology. Hartmann, who succeeded Natorp\nas Chair at Marburg in 1924, eventually became important in the\nphilosophical developments of Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer.\nIn 1912, Ortega began to study phenomenology “seriously”\nand in 1913, he recollected years later, the Jahrbuch für\nPhilosophie und Phänomenologische Forschung, Husserl's\nIdeen (Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology,\n[1913, 1982]), and Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of\nValues of Scheler were published. Later that year, in a series of\narticles which were published in the Revista de Libros,\nOrtega wrote a long review of Heinrich Hoffman's dissertation,\nStudies on the Concept of Sensation, which had been presented\nto the University of Göttingen during the same year. In the\nessay, which discussed the descriptive psychology of one of the lesser\nknown students of the Göttingen Circle, Ortega remarked that  \nthe influence—each time greater—of\n“phenomenology” on psychology tends to separate in the\nlatter, in the most fundamental and salubrious manner, description\nfrom explanation. (Obras, VIII: 43, 47; I: 244–45)  \nThree of the five sections of the review elaborated on certain aspects\nof Husserl's phenomenology, in a general sense, as the pure\ndescription of essences. In view of this characterization of\nphenomenology as “descriptive psychology,” Ortega\nemphasized the importance of distinguishing the essential individual\nintuition of Husserl's “pure description” of essence in\nthe Ideas from what he termed the mistaken definition of\nphenomenology as a descriptive psychology that some philosophers tend\nto interpret in Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen\n(Obras, I: 249, 251). Psychological statements, for Ortega,\nhave to be distinguished from the purely descriptive statements of\nphenomenology on the grounds that psychology concerns itself with\nfacts and statements and are therefore empirical; on the other hand,\nphenomenology, as formulated in a clearer formula in Husserl's\nIdeas, concerns itself with “consciousness”,\nhuman consciousness. Through this formulation, Ortega contended, it\n \nis very clear that the new science [phenomenology] is not psychology,\nif by psychology we mean a descriptive empirical science or a\nmetaphysical science. (Obras, I: 253)  \nOrtega's dissatisfaction with this psychological understanding of\ntheIdeas anticipated, in part, statements made by Husserl in\n1935. In his Crisis for European Sciences and Transcendental\nPhenomenology (1936), Husserl remarked in passing that several of\nthe paragraphs and locutions of transcendental phenomenology may have\nmisled several readers to understand his thesis in a psychological\nsense. This becomes as much the case of consciousness as what remains\nafter all transcendence has been bracketed, as of the thesis of\nnoesis-noema correlation. The transcendental nature of the\nconcept of noema easily could have been misperceived in favor\nof a psychological understanding, particularly in view of the fact\nthat the radical feature of both the epoché and the\n“constitution” thesis was not developed fully to his\nsatisfaction. The exposition of the epoché in the\nIdeas, Husserl recalled in the Crisis, appeared too\nCartesian, implying that one may shift suddenly from the natural to\nthe transcendental viewpoint (1936 [1970: 154–5]). According to\nOrtega, Husserl presented phenomenology as a descriptive manner in\nwhich one philosophizes without presuppositions and without empirical\nstatements. The phenomenological reduction, in the Ideas,\nprovided the principal theme of this “new science” as it\naccounted for the reflexive process of “consciousness”, a\nconsciousness that comprises consciousness of perceptions of the\nnatural world. Thus, for Ortega, Husserl's position reduces phenomena\nas entities in the natural posture of our world: \nThere is a “natural manner” of carrying out acts of\nconsciousness, whatever they may be. That natural manner is\ncharacterized by the executive value which those acts have. Thus the\n“natural posture” in the act of perception consists in\naccepting as existing in truth before us a thing that belongs to a\ngroup of things which we consider in fact to be real and which we call\n“world”…. \nThus, all the acts of consciousness and all the objects of those acts\ncan be placed in parentheses. The whole “natural” world or\nscience insofar as it is a system of judgments carried out in a\n“natural manner”, is reduced to phenomenon. And here, a\nphenomenon does not mean what it does in Kant, for example, something\nthat suggests another substantial something beyond it. Phenomenon here\nis simply the virtual character that every thing acquires when from\nits natural executive value one passes to contemplate it in a\nspectacular and descriptive posture, without giving it a definite\ncharacter. \nThat pure description is phenomenology. (Obras, I:\n252–53) \nThis sympathetic discussion of Husserl's Ideas inspired\nOrtega to pursue the new science of phenomenology as a method of\ninquiry. This method of inquiry became crucial especially in view of\nhis expressed objective to make a distinction between descriptive and\nexplanatory psychology and, thereby, to clarify the concept of the\nmental status of consciousness. After the 1912 paper and a paper\ndelivered at the Fourth Congress of the Spanish Association for the\nAdvancement of Science in 1913 on “Sensation, Construction and\nIntuition”, he presented a series of lectures for the course,\n“Systematic Psychology”, in 1915. Ortega expanded these\nlectures into a manuscript entitled Psychological\nInvestigations, which has been published posthumously. These\npsychological investigations constituted for him a philosophical basis\nupon which to define mental phenomena, very much in the manner Husserl\nhad set out to perform in his Logical Investigations.\nInspired by Franz Brentano's reformist vision of philosophy as an\nexact science, Husserl adopted the viewpoint of his mentor to posit\nphilosophy as a “rigorous science”. Husserl's early work\non presupposition-less descriptive psychology was also concerned with\nBrentano's concept of presentation and the intentional inexistence of\nan object. Following Brentano and Carl Stumpf, he regarded the\nessential nature of psychic acts as having content and, normally, an\nobject. In the First Edition of the Logical Investigations,\n1900–1901, Husserl understood Phenomenology to mean\n“descriptive psychology”, which had its origins in\nBrentano's earlier efforts. At the turn of the twentieth century, the\nemergence of psychology as an independent discipline, liberated from\nthe traditional tutelage of philosophy, led to intense investigations\nof human behavior which soon revealed the need for subtler methods of\nanalysis than those provided by the physical sciences. Gradually, a\nnew conception of the individual emerged, different from the\ntraditional conceptions as new mathematical physics was different from\nits mechanistic predecessor. \nFor certain authorities, knowledge attains legitimacy when it has been\ninvested with the power of tradition. The need to make an appeal to\ntradition represents one of the characteristics that grants authority\nto classical authors. In his quest for a scientific methodology with\nthe objective of tackling new problems, Ortega asked whether\nphilosophical legitimacy was attainable without appealing to\ntraditional authority. The formal principles for discursive\njustification provide the procedural basis for distinguishing new\nscience from the classical. For, he writes,  \nanyone who seriously wants to establish a new science will have to\npractice the self-denial required in prolonging a long time this\nperiods of schooling, of apprenticeship, of studying the classics.\n(Obras, XII: 340)  \nTo be sure, he contended, \nScientific research, as a way of expanding knowledge, obliges us to\novercome classicism. The very process of apprenticeship carries within\nitself the requirement that it come to an end and yield to independent\ncreation. To study or to learn from a classic ultimately impels us to\nemulate what its author did: to surpass the previous classical stance,\nto transform, to extend, and to renew science itself. (Obras,\nXII: 340–41) \nFrom this stance, Ortega maintained that classical or traditional\nscience possessed an aura of privilege, distance and permanence about\nit, but the new science, in challenging this privilege and claims of\npermanence with an alternative perception of reality, disintegrated\nthat aura and allowed the inquirer to encounter reality in terms of\nhis or her own time and place. In view of this characterization,\nOrtega formulated his philosophical objective within the context of\nthe early twentieth century. \nMy purpose is to study the fundamental problems of psychology with the\npurpose of making systematic psychology possible. These problems\n… do not allow for vague treatment; in fact, they demand a most\ndetailed and, if possible, exhaustive inquiry. (Obras, XII:\n42) \nOrtega maintains that once the problem concerning the distinction\nbetween mental and physical phenomena have been established, other\nquestions will also be resolved: those pertaining to the object and\nmethod of psychology and logic; the nature of inner perception and of\nintrospection; the possibility or impossibility of a straightforward\ndescriptive psychology of thinking; the meaning of intuition; and\n“consequently, whether or not nonnutritive thought is\npossible” (Obras, XII: 342–43). \nSubsequent to the 1912 essay and the 1915 lectures, the influence of\nthe language of phenomenology becomes discernible in the works of\nOrtega through the usage of such terms as “apodictic\nappearance”, philosophy as “a science”, and\nphilosophy “as a science without supposition”\n(Obras, I: 318–19; VII: 335). Since 1914, Ortega\nremarked in his work The Idea of Principle in Leibnitz and the\nEvolution of Deductive Theory (1947), which was published\nposthumously in 1958, a  \nreflection on the phenomenon “human life” is the basis of\nall my thought. At that time I formulated it—in order to expound\nHusserl's phenomenology during various courses—correcting, in an\nessential manner, the description of the phenomenon\n“consciousness of…”. which, as is known,\nconstituted, at that time, the basis of his doctrine. (Obras,\nVIII: 273, n.2)  \nIn 1925, he wrote a short section in his essay, The Dehumanization\nof Art entitled “A Few Drops of Phenomenology”, in\nwhich he discussed the “perspectivism” motif of variegated\nexperiences (Obras, III: 360–64). The discrepancy\nbetween science and experience, though extreme for some of his\ncontemporaries, became one of his central concerns during this period.\nHe maintained that the different perspectival perceptions of an\nidentical event illuminated for us the fact that “one and the\nsame reality may split into many diverse realities when it is beheld\nfrom different points of view”. Modern physics, while leaving\nmechanistic explanations of certain natural phenomena intact,\nshattered the overall mechanistic conception of nature. It demolished\nthe notion of an objective reality with all that it implied: the unity\nof nature, both human and physical, the universality of natural laws,\nthe determination of physical processes, and the ability of science to\nsolve all problems of the natural world. The findings of modern\nphysics, therefore, were bound to have had an enormous impact on\ngeneral culture, even greater than that, according to Ortega, of\nbiology in the mid-nineteenth century. Albert Einstein, he argued,\nstruck the first telling blow against the concept of an objective\nreality—a concept that assumes the existence of universal time\nand space into which nature fits, independently of the observer.\nEinstein demonstrated that there is no single spatial and\nchronological frame of reference. Every observer is confined to a\nspecific and relative time-space system. Ortega perceived, in this\nsystem, the “human point of view” as that reality in which\nwe live: situations, persons and things. To establish distance between\nourselves and reality as a manner of understanding these lived\nexperiences—which are by no means absolute—we have to\nproject ourselves into the place of another person and situation. In\ndoing so, we may come to distinguish among persons, things and\nsituations and thereby come to observe reality more closely\n(Obras, III: 361, 363, 362). \nIn 1925, Ortega presented Husserl's phenomenological approach to his\nstudents at the University of Madrid, wherein he projected his program\nto study the “restatement of the problem of Being” for a\nseries of publications. Specifically, Ortega oriented himself towards\nthe possible adoption of a systematic method within which the problem\nof “Being” might have resolved the issue of human reality\nfor him in the development of his thought. “In 1925”, he\nrecounted: \nIn this account of his quest for “synthetic thinking”,\nOrtega proceeded to explain how he  \nabandoned Phenomenology at the very moment of accepting it. Instead of\nwithdrawing from consciousness, as has been done since Descartes, we\nbecome firm in the radical reality which is for every one his [or her]\nlife. (Obras, VIII: 273)  \nIn this manner, by 1925, Ortega's ambivalence towards adopting a\nphenomenological method became apparent in his search for a coherent\nmethod of analysis. He was willing to retain the\n“synthetic” (or “intuitive”) function of\nphenomenological analysis provided that this function in turn becomes\nintegrated into the systematic phenomenon of “human life”.\nThrough this connection, the phenomenological method of analysis, and\nthe analysis of human life experiences, performed interchangeable\nfunctions for Ortega in the systematic apprehension of the traditional\nproblem of being. This explains the positive side of the ambivalence\nwhich prompted him to approach and accept phenomenology. However, on\nthe other side of the ambivalence, he avoided phenomenology where the\nemphasis appears to be more abstract and in the tradition of idealism.\nHis response to Husserl's Formal and Transcendental Logic\n(1929) [1969] points to his criticism of this tendency in\nphenomenology. \nSeveral European thinkers who were influenced in one way or another by\nconcepts of the phenomenological movement, but were not necessarily\nmembers of the movement, became dissatisfied with the alleged\nsolipsistic standpoint of Husserl's transcendental phenomenology in\nthe Formal and Transcendental Logic. Ortega was one of these\nthinkers, although he did not explicitly express any dissatisfaction\nwith what he perceived as the solipsistic implications of the\ntranscendental idealism in the latter work until twelve years later.\nAs indicated earlier, Husserl expressed dissatisfaction as well in his\nCrisis, saying that his transcendental epoché\nmay have been misread by others. Indeed, Husserl insisted that his\nefforts attempted to point away from the solipsistic path of the\n“Cartesian way”. In two lectures delivered at the Sorbonne\nin 1929, Husserl introduced ideas which transformed his earlier\nposition on transcendental phenomenology from a world of isolated\nideas into a world community of intersubjective individuals. The\nobservations and insights made in the lectures were amplified later in\nhis Cartesian Meditations (1933) and Crisis. In\nthese later writings, Descartes' ego lost its abstract, absolute\nstatus as it became correlative to the world of experience (1933\n[1964: 1–8, 157]; 1936 [1970: 154–55, 188, 257–63]).\nIn his Notes on Thinking (1941), Ortega found Husserl's\napproach to the problem of genesis of reason to be “tantamount\nto being absolute”, particularly where Husserl expounded his\n“genetic phenomenology” as “consciousness of”\nreality, thereby designating “consciousness of itself” as\nbeing “immediate to itself”. He criticized further the\nanalysis and definitions of reason given by Husserl in Formal and\nTranscendental Logic as not incorporating “the themes of\nhumanity, life and the functional character of reason”.\nAccordingly, “the phenomenological attitude as formulated in\nFormal and Transcendental Logic is diametrically opposed to\nthe attitude that I call living reason”. He opposed this\ntendency toward transcendental idealism in Formal and\nTranscendental Logic but refused to completely reject\nphenomenology (Obras, V: 545). \nOur discussion thus far makes manifest Ortega's ambivalence toward\nphenomenology. After he learned of Husserl's Crisis of European\nSciences, Ortega did not argue that his later general position\nand that of phenomenology were “diametrically opposed”.\nIndeed, in a long footnote at the conclusion of Notes on\nThinking, Ortega invited a comparison between himself and\nHusserl. In 1935, Husserl presented a series of four lectures in\nPrague on “Philosophy in the Crisis of European Mankind”,\nall of which were incorporated into theCrisis. At the time of\nhis Cartesian Meditations and Crisis of European\nSciences, Husserl proclaimed that scientific knowledge can be\nunderstood only to the extent that we first understand the notion,\nLebenswelt. The Crisis became famous for its\nthematic treatment of the concept, life-world. The study of that lived\nworld and of our experience of it, of\n“ego-and-life-relatedness”, becomes the primary\nconsideration of phenomenology. Lebenswelt philosophy is\nprimarily engaged in the elaboration of the broader question posed in\nLogical Investigations: what is meant by “truth”?\nTruth has been defined here as lived experience of truth—that\nis, evidence. Evidence is revealed exclusively in present experience,\nand thereby truth is always and exclusively tested in present\nexperience as one cannot relive the flux of experience. There is no\nabsolute truth, as postulated by either dogmatism or skepticism.\nRather, truth defines itself in process, as revision, correction, and\nself-surpassing. This dynamic process occurs at the heart of the\nliving present. Consequently, as individuals living in the world, we\nrespond correctly to the question of truth by describing the\nexperience of the true and insisting on the genetic development of the\n“ego”: truth consists not as an object but as a movement,\nand exists only insofar as this movement is actually carried out\nby the ego. Also, in regard to the life-world, the innovative\ncontribution of Crisis lies in Husserl's attempt to provide a\nthematic account of history, the historicity of the life-world and\nsubjectivity within the overall framework of transcendental\nphenomenology. History, however, as Husserl came to understand it,\nconsists from the outset, in “nothing other than the living\nmoment of being-with-one-another and in-one-another of original\nmeaning-constitution and meaning-sedimentation”. This has also\nbeen referred to as “intentional history”. Furthermore,\nthe concepts of history, the historicity of the life-world, are made\npossible by the inner historicity of every human being living in it.\nHistory thereby exhibits an historical “a priori”\nitself which, for him, assures objectivity of history. The historical\na priori itself presupposes a certain idealization in that\nthe “insights of principle” are historical.\nHistory becomes mastered not by an a-historical apriorism, but by a\ntranscendental stance which demonstrates that the process of\nconstitution developed in history may be, in its essential structure,\ndeciphered in reflective thinking by the reflecting ego, like the\nconstitution of modern science. Thus, the truths of science are\nfounded neither in Divine Providence, as Descartes thought, nor on the\na priori conditions of possibility, as Kant thought. Rather,\nthey are grounded in lived experiences on which the truth of the\ntheoretical consciousness is based (Husserl 1936 [1970: 349–51,\n369–78, 389–95]). \nOrtega found this kind of reflection on the historical manner of\nbeing, and the life-world, compatible with his own notion of\n“historical reason” presented in History as a\nSystem. Upon insisting that he arrived at this position\nindependently of Husserl, Ortega made clear his favorable response to\nthe innovative contribution made by Husserl in the Crisis.\n“Personally”, Ortega commented concerning his reaction to\nthe 1935 publication,  \nthis leap of the phenomenological doctrine has been extremely\nsatisfactory for me because it consists in nothing less than a resort\nto “historical reason”. (Obras, V: 546–7,\nn.1)  \nTherefore, Husserl's later works, particularly Cartesian\nMeditations and the Crisis, which were attempts to\nresolve the difficulties inherent in transcendental phenomenology and\nrepresentative of his phenomenological philosophy, were not\ndiametrically opposed to the themes of human life. Nor did they\nneglect the importance of postulating the epistemological and\nontological functions of the experience of human life. The orientation\nof these later writings has contributed to the theory that Husserl\nperceived the Crisis as the “definitive”\nintroduction to phenomenology. \nClearly, Husserl's idea of Lebenswelt was the kind of notion\nthat Ortega discussed in his own philosophy of human life. But this\naffinity in thought does not negate minor differences between the two\nthinkers. Discussions in Cartesian Meditations of the problem\nof other people, or intersubjectivity, and of the world as a world\nessentially inhabited by “others” was conceivably the part\nof Heidegger's philosophy which had the profoundest effect on the\ndevelopment of Existential Phenomenology and Ortega's thought. Ortega\ntook issue with a small point on the role of the notion\n“analogical transposition” concerning the\n“Other”, which was made in the fifth meditation, yet he\ndid not consider this point to be diametrically opposed to his notion\nof human life. “Husserl”, he remarked at one point in his\nMan and People (1939–40),  \nwas the first who clearly defined the radical and not merely\npsychological problem that I call “The Appearance of the\nOther”. Husserl's development of the problem is, in my opinion,\nmuch less successful than his definition of it, although there are\nmany admirable discoveries in his development. (Obras, VII:\n160–61) \nMan and People feature essays which Ortega developed and\npresented in several lectures and courses over a period of\napproximately twenty years. In The Origin of Philosophy, in a\nfootnote, Ortega referred to the occasion in which he presented for\nthe first time his concept of a “new sociology” under the\ntitle, “Man and People” in Valladolid in 1934\n(Obras, IX: 355, n.1). The first chapter was published as\n“Being in and Beside One's Self” by Espasa-Calpe\nArgentina, Buenos Aires, 1939 (Obras, V: 291–315; 7:,\n72–73, 79). In a Prologue to his Ideas and Beliefs,\nOrtega announced in 1940 the forthcoming appearance of two major\nworks: a philosophical exposition, Dawn of Historical Reason,\nand the corpus of his social doctrine, Man and People. These\nvariegated expositions were compiled and published posthumously from\n1948–50. In 1929, Ortega wrote an essay titled “The\nPerception of One's Fellowman” (Obras, VI:\n153–163) that may explain his attempt to distinguish his concept\nof “the other” from Husserl's notion of the\n“appearance of the other”in Man and People in\nview of the inevitable comparisons made between the two. \nThe foregoing discussion should not suggest an absence of shared\nviewpoints between Ortega and Husserl, and Husserl's intellectual\ninfluence on Ortega. Although Ortega disagreed with Husserl's notion\nof “analogical transposition”, he did view the latter's\nphenomenological approach to knowledge as having been “the\ngreatest influence of this last half-century”. Ortega also\nconsidered the notion of the appearance of the other—that is,\nthe other's presence both as an object (i.e., the physical structure\nof its body) and as a subject (i.e., as an alter ego that experiences\nthe same world that is experienced by the “I”)—and\nlife experience as analyses which helped avert solipsism and the\nenclosure of the “I” within itself. Through this\nconnection, Ortega aligns himself with Husserl's repudiation of the\nCartesian distinction between the interior (in the mind) and the\nexterior (in the world) (Obras, V: 545). Although Ortega's\nown independence of thought remains controversial, his intellectual\ndevelopment exhibits a consistent emphasis on discerning the boundary\ndrawn between extra-historical and historical coherence in\ntranscendental phenomenology. Ortega discussed, in his later writings,\nsuch phenomenological notions as actions which are directed toward\nobjects when the “I” encounters its environment; ego/alter\nego interaction in the world of intersubjective communities as the\nrealm of lived experiences; and the position of entering the\ntranscendental attitude of phenomenological reduction in order to\napprehend the alter ego, all of which are notions similar to those\ndiscussed by Husserl. In these authoritative writings, his criterion\nof “openness to experience” led him to an acceptance of\nhistorical variegation, and to the principle that a human being's\nrelation to the world consists in a total relation of one entity among\nother entities. \nFrom the viewpoint of this characterization of phenomenology, Ortega\nreached back to “I am I and my circumstances” as his\nstarting point of analysis. For Ortega, the individual ego is\nconscious of itself through the awareness of both its physiological\nfeatures and behavioral gestures, and those of “others” in\nreciprocal human interaction, a consciousness of self that proceeds\nthrough self-analysis of the inner essence of the being of the\n“I” and the “I's” awareness of other selves as\nsimilar beings in the “circumstances” of the world of\nlived experience. In short, he attempted to characterize the nature of\nan individual's experience of his world and himself. There is an\nattempt to distinguish between the facts that one's relationship to an\norganism is different from one's relation to a person qua being, and\nthat one's actions toward an organism are different from the way that\none acts toward a person. “Living”, he said, “is to\nreach outside of oneself, devoted ontologically, to what is\nother, be it called world or circumstances”\n(Obras, V: 545). \nIn an edition of his work (1932), Ortega proclaimed: \nThe first book to which Ortega referred was his Meditations on\nQuixote (1914), a work of essays he thought propelled\nphilosophical aspirations. According to some commentators, the nucleus\nof Ortega's basic philosophical principle—the notion that human\nlife is the ultimate reality—is formulated in the\nMeditations on Quixote through the instrumentality of his\nwell known expression, “I am I and my circumstances”. A\nclose and critical reading of the Meditations on Quixote and\nOrtega's later writings reveals that albeit “I am I and my\ncircumstances” appeared in this early work, we fail to perceive\na systematic elaboration of “I am I and my circumstances”\nas an analytical and ontological statement in his general philosophic\npoint of view before his later works. The psychological interpretation\nof external and internal excitation, as discussed by Freud in the\nOutline of Psychoanalysis (1940) and The Psychopathology\nof Everyday Life (1904), arrested Ortega's attention on this new\nscientific method between 1911 and 1915. Husserl and the\nphenomenological movement, and Freud and the psychoanalytical\nmovement, presented for Ortega the new “intellectual tendency of\nour times—subjectivism, or subjectivistic relativism”\n(Obras, XII: 417). This intellectual tendency became his\nphilosophic concern during the succeeding years. This concern became\napparent in his lectures of 1921–22, subsequently published as\nThe Theme of Our Time (1923). For Ortega, the\n“principal theme of our time”, the essence of which\n“modernity” had to confront, comprised the concept that\n“human life is in an eminent degree psychological life”\n(Obras, III: 152–156). \nThe phenomenon of human life thus possesses a “double\ncharacter”: the physiological and the psychological. In the\nmodern movement of culture, each dimension of human character has to\nfind its expression within the “spirit of the time”\n(Obras, III: 165–66, 68, 297–98). The\ntransformation of the modern sense of human life may be understood\nbest from the new art of his time. Ortega perceived the artists of his\nday as creating a much more radical alteration in the subjective\nattitude of art. From the point of view of the new sense of art, human\nreality possesses its inner perception. This shift of emphasis in the\nrealm of aesthetics countervailed the earlier emphasis on\n“naturalist”, “materialist” or\n“realist” factors in human life. The transition in\naesthetic sensibility from nineteenth-century “realism”,\nand its corresponding concern with human reality, to the\n“new” perceptions of the early twentieth century\ncreativity, marked for him the “dehumanization of art”.\nThe “modern” movement culminated in a new aesthetic\nsensitivity—what Ortega labeled a “pure”,\n“artistic art”—which consciously separated its\naudience into groups: the “specially gifted minority” who\ncomprehended modern art and the majority of those who found it\nincomprehensible. The new aesthetic sensibility of modernity, which\ncalled for the “progressive elimination of the human, all too\nhuman elements” predominant in romantic and naturalistic\nproduction, resulted in creating an art of figures instead of an art\nof adventures, an art that refused solely to report the world, and\nvowed to create it (Obras, III: 358, 355–56). This\nmodern group of artists and critics who produced art and possessed\n“an organ of comprehension” denied to the majority\nconstituted “a specially gifted minority”. A pronounced\nemphasis on the “psychic structure of the individual” thus\nbecame one of the primary consequences of modernity's shift from\nrealism and human representation. \nIf Ortega's notion that the “psychic” depictions of modern\nart were only accessible to a gifted minority were extended to\nincorporate the notion that every individual intellectual activity\napprehends reality from a point of view accessible only to itself, his\nphilosophy of “perspectivism” as the synthetic principle\nwhich “regulated the world from the point of view of life”\nbecomes intelligible. The “theme of our time” reflected\nthe absolutist tendencies of rationalism and the skeptical\ninclinations of relativism, proposing Ortega's doctrine of “the\npoint of view as a third view of the process of knowledge, which is a\nperfect synthesis of the two” (Obras, III: 179,\n198). \nThe doctrine of perspectivism expounds the proposition that all\nhistorical epochs participate in contributing an element of truth to\nreality. That is, each individual and each collection of individuals\napprehend reality from the point of view of their respective\nperceptions of reality. The varying perceptions of reality are all\nlegitimate and account for the postulate that different individuals\ninterpret the same “horizon” differently so that\n“every life is a point of view directed upon the\nuniverse” (Obras, III: 200). Ortega's\n“perspectivist” postulate thus promised to perform the\nfunction of unifying reality. From the assumption that\n“perspective” comprises both “one of the component\nparts of reality and its organizing element”, Ortega arrived at\nthe position that “all knowledge is knowledge from a definite\npoint of view” (Obras, III: 199). Hence every truth\nconnects to a place in space and time. In locating truth in space and\ntime, he derived both the mode of perception and the essence of\nreality. \nOrtega perceived in his perspectivist mode of apprehending reality a\nphilosophical analogue to Einstein's physics and, subsequently,\ninvited a comparison of his philosophy of perspectivism to Einstein's\nSpecial Theory of Relativity. Ortega's essay on “The Historical\nSignificance of Einstein's Theory” pointed to parallel\ntendencies in new modes of twentieth century thinking and in\nEinstein's theory of relativity, which he characterized as “the\nmost important intellectual fact that the present can show”\n(Obras, III: 231). In dissolving the entire edifice of\nclassical mechanics, Einstein's theory ushered in the twentieth\ncentury (the “present time”) very much in the manner that\nDescartes' philosophy prepared thought for the modern era\n(Obras, III: 231–34). Ortega's ideas on the historical\nsignificance of relativity were derived primarily from Einstein's\ndiscussion of the Special Theory. He was drawn to comparing the theory\nof relativity to his philosophy of “perspectivism” because\nrelativity appeared to furnish scientific “proof” of his\nown “perspectivist truths”, which were formulated in El\nEspectador in 1916 (Obras, III: 235; see also II:\n15–21). \nOrtega's perspectivist doctrine, as a synthetic principle, also\nimplied for him a doctrine by which one may “attempt to order\nthe world from the point of view of life” (Obras, III:\n179). The principle of human life, which constituted the reality of\nhuman experience, became the philosophical category through which\nOrtega synthesized the universe. Correspondingly, the “sign of\nthe times” also pointed to the important role played by\nNietzsche, Croce, Dilthey and Heidegger, as well as Freud and Husserl,\nin the formation of twentieth-century thought. The emphasis placed\nupon the vital world of life took Ortega a step beyond the Neo-Kantian\ntranscendental logic of Cohen. Ortega combined his idea of human life\nwith an emphasis on history as constituting the vital dynamics of its\nexpression, and this viewpoint carried him closer to the humanistic\nside of the Naturwissenschaften-Geisteswissenschaften\ndistinction made by the Southwest German or Baden School and Dilthey\nthan to Cohen's Neo-Kantianism. \nThe striking similarities in the historicist focus of Windelband,\nRickert and Dilthey, the early historical thought of Croce, and the\nhistorical thought of Ortega suggest that Ortega was influenced by\ntheir ideas both directly and indirectly. The historical ideas of\nWindelband and Rickert reflected the European intellectual currents\nthat paralleled Ortega's intellectual development, Dilthey had been\nacknowledged by Ortega as having influenced his intellectual focus\ndirectly, and Croce's early historical ideas appeared to have exerted\ninfluence on the historical thought of Ortega. \nIn his essay, “Wilhelm Dilthey and the Idea of Life”,\ntwenty–seven years after his studies in Berlin, Ortega wrote of\nDilthey's importance in his intellectual development and his\nmisfortune of not having been exposed to the ideas of Dilthey earlier\nas a student:  \nI became acquainted with Dilthey's work as late as 1929, and it took\nme four more years before I knew it sufficiently well. This ignorance,\nI do not hesitate to maintain, has caused me to lose about ten years\nof my life—ten years, in the first place of intellectual\ndevelopment, but that of course, means an equal loss in all other\ndimensions of life…. When I studied in Berlin in\n1906…Dilthey happened to have given up lecturing in\nthe university building a few years before and admitted to courses he\nheld in home for only a few specially prepared students. Thus\nchance had it that I did not come in touch with him.\n(Obras, VI: 171–72)  \nBy the late 1920s and the early 1930s, however, Ortega did incorporate\nthe idea of human life into his philosophic viewpoint. During these\nyears, he labeled his own philosophy as “the metaphysics of\nvital reason” to signify his continuous search for a structure\nof life that would be transcendent in its relation to every existing\nreality, and yet itself located within the framework of temporal and\nspatial reality. Like Dilthey, whom he considered “the most\nimportant thinker of the second half of the nineteenth century”,\nhe denied truth to any constant principle that establishes itself as\nsuperior to the flux of life, including that of the physical and\nbiological sciences. Dilthey's Lebensphilosophie, which\nemphasizes openness to experience, not only denies the notion of an\nabstract transcendental reality, but also considers life to be more\nthan mere biological organism. His concept of life is not biological,\nand in this sense, Ortega's notion of human life is quite similar to\nDilthey's. For Ortega, “my life”—in the\n“biographical” not in the “biological”\nsense—is the question of what to do with it and that of what\nhappens to me as I find myself “shipwrecked” in the\nprecarious sea of “circumstances”. The individual, from\nthis point of view, saves himself by sinking into the inner depths of\nhis being as he makes an effort to hold on to consciousness and to the\nvery essence of his life. “To live”, he maintained,\n“is to deal with the world, aim at it, act in it, be occupied\nwith it” (Obras, V: 26, 33–34, 35, 44–45,\nVII: 103–04). For Dilthey, life is realized empirically within\nthe experiential process of consciousness, as lived experience, which\ngives the experience of the individual life and reality. Dilthey's\nposition, like Bergson's, contains the vitalist viewpoint that our\nexperience of the life of our own minds is a direct experience of that\nlife, as it exists, and therefore cannot be perceived as some\nmechanistic physiological explanation of human organism or as some\nsubjective neo-idealistic logical principle. The emphasis on the\nactive, dynamic, and historical dimensions of human and social\nphenomena, as realized within the lived experiences of life, reveal\nthe vitalization of philosophy and the historicization of life\nperspective that are reflective of historicism and the attitude that\nhistorical knowledge is unique to the realm of human affairs. \nThis historicism comprises the perspective perceived in Ortega's\nnotion of the “dynamic dialogue” in the\n“drama” of the life-world of the individual. Historicism\nis not used here in the polemical extreme characterized by Karl\nPopper's charge that historicism is incompatible with any form of\n“genuine science”. In his The Poverty of\nHistoricism (1957), which describes and criticizes both\n“anti-naturalist” and “pro-naturalist”\ndoctrines of historicism, Popper charges the former doctrine with\n“theology” and “holism” and charges the latter\ndoctrine of advancing the notion that “historical\nprediction” is their principal objective, something that\nbecomes  \nattainable in discovering the “rhythms”,\n“patterns”, “laws” or “trends”\nthat underlie the evolution of history. (1957 [1964: 2–4, 39,\n128–30])  \nPopper's title alludes to Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy\n(1847), which, in turn, responded to Proudhon's The Philosophy of\nPoverty (1847). Ortega thereby signaled his intention to\nformulate a philosophico-methodological criticism of Marxist and, by\nextension, Hegelian philosophy of history. The term\n“historicism”signifies here both “historism”\n(in the German sense of Historismus in connection with\nWindelband, Rickert, Dilthey, Meinecke—by way of Herder and\nGoethe—Mannheim and Troeltsch), and “historicism”\n(in the Italian sense of Storicismo as formulated by\nBenedetto Croce). In tracing the term to both Herder and Goethe,\nMeinecke perceived their emphasis on the “concrete”, the\n“unique” and the “individual” as constituting\nthe core of historicism. Through this emphasis, historicism,\nunderstood as an outlook on the world (Weltanschauung),\nemphasizes the historical quality of human existence; as an\ninterpretation of history and life, it concerns itself with concepts\nof individuality and with individual development. Historicism seeks to\ndescribe and interpret the unsystematic variety of the reality of\nsociety and history, for the concept of individuality not only\nembraces individual persons but also includes the variety of\nhistorical forms, such as different peoples, customs, cultures,\ninstitutions, nation-states and the like; and the concept of\ndevelopment includes the historical process—at a particular time\nand place—within which individuality manifests itself not by\nabstract, general laws or principles but by the living expressions of\nthe multiplicity of these unique historical forms. Individuality, the\n“fact of change”, and the historical process, the\nWeltanschauung of historicism, combine to formulate a sort of\nhistorical relativism. This signification of historical phenomena\nentails the sense in which historical knowledge and reality are\nexplained by Dilthey:  \nThe historical consciousness of the finitude of every historical\nphenomenon, every human or social state, of the relativity of every\nsort of belief, is the last step toward the liberation of man. With\nit, man attains the sovereign power to wring from every experience its\ncontent, to surrender wholly to it without prepossession….\nEvery beauty, every sanctity, every sacrifice, re-lived and expounded,\nopens up perspectives which disclose a reality…. And, in\ncontrast with the relativity, the continuity of the creative force\nmakes itself feel as the central historical fact. (quoted in Hodges\n1944: 33-34). \nThe historicist orientation of Croce contributed to Ortega's shift\nfrom the historicization of life to the historicization of philosophy.\nOrtega's aspirations concerning the interpenetration of history and\nphilosophy were conveyed in his 1929 lectures:  \nI hope, for very concrete reasons, that in our age the curiosity for\nthe eternal and invariable which is philosophy and the curiosity for\nthe inconstant and changeable which is history, for the first time\njoin each other and embrace. (Obras, VII: 285)  \nOrtega's view that “historical thinking proceeds with respect to\nhuman phenomena”, which combined with his notion of the vital\ndimensions of “historical reason”, reveals some of the\naffinities in their historical thought. Croce and Ortega both viewed\nhuman life as embodying an essentially historical process within which\nthe realm of human reality is perceived and understood. Historical\nknowledge is found in the flow of the historical process, and\nknowledge of this very process provides an essential understanding of\nhuman reality. Where history, for Croce, consists in the\n“inseparable synthesis of individual and universal”,\nhistory, for Ortega, embodies the “inexorable chain” of\nhuman experiences and is constituted by the synthetic function of\n“historical reason”. Traversing from philosophy to history\nand then back again to philosophy, Croce presented his systematic\n“Philosophy of the Spirit” as absolute historicism. He\nformulated his systematic treatment of the “Philosophy of the\nSpirit” in four volumes and devoted one volume of this general\nposition to historical thought (Croce 1917 [1920: 60–61]).\nHistory, in this connection, provides the important function of\nsynthesizing the theoretical and practical levels of human activity,\nthe universal and the particular, as well as thought and action. From\nthe point of view of these levels of human activity, historical\nknowledge provides information about what actually happened on\nparticular occasions at a particular place and under a clearly\nspecified period of time. History encompasses not only concrete\nindividual developments and concepts of individuality, but also\nencompasses the “universal”. For Croce, individuality\nconstitutes the historical process within which an advance towards the\nuniversal occurs and, in this context, the general is identified with\nwhat the individual experiences directly. The historical process\nbecomes the expression of the “inseparable synthesis of\nindividual and universal” and, as such, establishes for Croce\nthe “identity of philosophy with history”. Croce viewed\nany philosophical problem identical to historical synthetic judgments\nwhen restored to the historical context that gave rise to the question\nwe attempt to answer. As the synthesis of the individual and the\nuniversal, history possesses the most complete form of knowledge.\nIndeed, for Croce, as well as for Collingwood, “history is\nthought”. From the theoretical perspective, thought establishes\nconnections between sensory-perception, intuition, and concepts,\nwhereas history synthesizes the aesthetic, logical and practical\nlevels of human activity. Theoretic activity consists of knowledge\nwhile practical activity is characterized by volition, and thereby\nwithin this perspective knowledge is the precondition of action (Croce\n1917 [1920: 60–61; 94–107]; 1909 [1913: 33]). \nIn the early 1930s Ortega formulated, in a systematic fashion, his\ngeneral philosophical standpoint—positing human life as the\nultimate reality—which contains philosophy within history. He\npresents it in his book En Torno a Galileo (1933), by way of\nhis theory of generations, and in his essay History as a\nSystem (1935). The “concept of being” or “human\nlife”, for Ortega, “is the very root of philosophy”,\nand, therefore “any reform of the idea of being means a radical\nreform in philosophy”. At this point, he abandoned the\n“biological organism” content of his earlier notion of\nlife in The Theme of Our Time to incorporate a concept of\nlife—“the life of each one of us”—as a\nbeing-that-lives-in-the-world. “Biologists”, he averred,\n \nuse the word “life” in order to designate the phenomena of\norganic beings…but…when we give this word a meaning\nwhich is more immediate, broader and more decisive. (Obras,\nIII: 166).  \nIn this broader connection, Ortega's concept of human life comprised a\ndimension which was similar to the Fundamentalontologie of\nHeidegger's Daseinanalyse. Ortega's analysis of human\nexistence and human life characterized “I am I and my\ncircumstances” as the interchangeable interaction of the\n“I” and “the world”. That is, “I am\nalways with myself…the world is always linked with me and my\nbeing is a being with the world” (Obras, VII: 394, 405,\n402). Ortega wanted to liberate the “I” from the\n“internal prison” of “subjectivism” and\nproposed that we “save ourselves in the world”, in\n“that vital horizon”. This sense of being as having been\n“thrown into” the “world” further\ncharacterizes the authentic reality of life as “finding oneself\nface to face with the world” and “inside the world”\n(Obras, VII: 411, 416–17, 430; compare Heidegger 1927\n[1962: 236, 399]). To “escape from idealism”, then,\n“life includes both the subject [the conscious self] and the\nworld”. Living is “finding oneself in the\nworld”. Hence:  \nLife always finds itself in certain circumstances, in an arrangement\nsurrounding it—circum—filled with things and other people.\nOne does not live in a world which is vague, except that the vital\nworld is circumstance [the things and the people around one]; it is\nthis world, here and now. (Obras, VII: 422, 431) \nOrtega considered Dilthey one of the “first discoverers”\nof “the new great Idea of life”, who has “taught us\nmore radically than any of his predecessors—Hegel,\nComte—to see historicity as a constitutive feature of the human\nbeing” (Obras, VI: 166; IX: 396). After the posthumous\npublication of Dilthey's Gesammelte Schriften in 1928 and\nOrtega's subsequent “acquaintance” with Dilthey's\nphilosophical work, we begin to observe the eventual unfolding of a\ngeneral systematic statement of human life in Ortega's philosophy and\nhistorical thought. The years surrounding Ortega's absorption of\nDilthey's writings suggest that he derived from Dilthey a sense of\nhistoricity, which he previously had never possessed. He assigned, as\ndid Dilthey, history the task of supplying human life's only\n“fixed, pre-established, and given line”, of converting\nitself into the “historical reason” which secures the one\nkind of continuous, empirical progress of which the individual is\ncapable. We also observe that, in addition to the influences of\nhistoricism and phenomenology, Ortega also integrated existential\nphilosophy into his general philosophical orientation. During the late\n1920s and 1930s, of his intellectual development, Ortega incorporated\nthe idea of human life into his fundamental philosophical outlook, and\nthe discernible transition from “vital reason” to\n“historical reason” occurred in his thought. That is, once\nhuman life was established as the basis of his philosophical\nstandpoint, “vital reason” and “historical\nreason” became interchangeable terms for Ortega (Obras,\nV: 538, VI: 39–41). Though he spoke of a parallelism between the\nideas of Dilthey and his own, during the period 1914 and 1929, and\nalthough his insistence on the fact that he discussed the notion of\n“vial reason” prior to the early 1930s remains accurate,\nthere was no such discussion of “historical reason” in the\nmanner in which one has become familiar with its usage in his mature\nwritings of the 1930s. After the publication of his lectures, What\nIs Philosophy? (1929) and his essay on Dilthey,\n“life” and “reason” and “vital\nreason”—or “living reason”—and\n“historical reason” were central concepts in the fusion of\nhis systematic analysis of man, society and history. Through the\ninfluence of the basic idea of Dilthey's Lebensphilosophie,\nOrtega was able to link his ontological point of view with his\nexistentialist and historicist viewpoints. The correlation of these\nconcepts, which placed a common emphasis upon the actions and the\ncreations of the individual, the facticity and the uniqueness of\nindividual human existence, makes explicit Ortega's connectedness to\nLebensphilosophie: “ Life”, Dilthey averred, “ is\nthe inner relationship of mental processes within a person. Knowledge\nof life is growing awareness of, and reflection on, life.”\n(Dilthey [1976: 125]). “The significance of life,” he\ncontended further, “lies in its shaping and its\ndevelopment.” (Dilthey [1962: 88]. Existential philosophy, in a\nvariety of ways, had been an outgrowth of Lebensphilosophie\nand phenomenology, and Ortega, with the complement of the historicist\nviewpoint of the “unique individual” and of “human\nlife” as the ultimate reality, appears to have pursued the path\nwhich had been directed by both Dilthey and Heidegger (Misch 1931:\n5–197, 216–37). \nIn his works in the 1930s, Ortega posited “human life” as\nultimate reality and, from this standpoint, connected the historicist\nphilosophical point of view that of existential phenomenology. The\nexistentialist perspective of Ortega closely resembles the\nFundamentalontologie or existentiale Analytik in\nHeidegger's Sein und Zeit. (Heidegger 1927 [1962: 21–83\n; Spiegelberg 1960: 62–74; Spiegelberg 1965: vol. 1,\n408–413). Through the epistemological standpoint of “I am\nI and my circumstances”, the individual, in realizing the\n“vital possibilities” of the essence of his being, engages\nactively in the human world. The process of the realization of man's\n“vital possibilities”—through the\n“circumstances” of his being—as a\nbeing-in-the-making and as a being-that-goes-on-being-in-the-world,\nOrtega characterized as a “drama” which\n“happens”. Ortega's notions of “life as a\nhappening”, the insecurity of human life in the face of death,\nthe ontological distinction between human life and things and between\n“being” and “authentic being”, are strikingly\nsimilar to ideas which had been formulated by Heidegger in 1927. In\nWhat Is Philosophy? he aligned his philosophical position\nwith that of Heidegger and the “new philosophy” of being,\nexistence, and human life: \nThese common words, finding oneself, world, occupying oneself, are now\ntechnical words in this new philosophy. One would be able to talk for\na long time on each one of them, but I will limit myself to observe\nthat this definition, “to live is to find oneself in a\nworld”, like all the principal ideas in these lectures, is\nalready in my published work. It is important to me to observe this,\nespecially, with regard to the idea of existence, for which I claim\nchronological priority. For that very reason I am pleased to\nacknowledge that the person who has gone deepest into the analysis of\nlife is the new German philosopher, Martin Heidegger.  \n…To live is to find oneself in the world. Heidegger, in a very\nrecent work of genius, has made us take notice of all the enormous\nsignificance of these words. (Obras, VI: 40-41; VII:\n415–16) \nOrtega was quite sensitive to implications drawn on the affinities\nbetween his work and Heidegger's, which, in part, explains his efforts\nto trace the originality of his formulations to his\nMeditations. Apart from a general discussion in his Idea\nof Principle in Leibniz and the Evolution of Deductive Theory\n(Obras, VIII: 270–300), and the essay\n“Martin Heidegger and Language of the\nPhilosophers”(Universitas, 7(9) [1952]: 897-903, Obras,\nIX: 625–44), Ortega referred to Heidegger only in passing in a\nlong footnote in his essay, “Goethe from Within” (1932)\nObras, 4: 403–04, 541. Whatever the context in which\nthis controversy over Ortega's intellectual indebtedness to Heidegger\nmay have been initiated, it was during this decisive period of the\n1930s that he turned to the systematic formulation of the philosophy\nof Lebensphilosophie, and it was also in this period that\nOrtega's explicit postulation of the notion “I am I and my\ncircumstances”, as radical reality, reflected the influence of\nexistential and phenomenological points of view in his philosophy of\nexistence, man and society. \nWhile Ortega's general ontological position does bear some\nsimilarities to Heidegger's existentiale Analytik, and while\nhis idea of human life shows some affinities with Dilthey's\nLebensphilosophie, there are also differences between these\nphilosophies and Ortega's fundamental philosophical position. The\nimportant difference to point out pertains to the observation that\nOrtega proceeded beyond the distinctive positions of\nDaseinanalyse and Lebensanalyse by incorporating the\ntwo concepts. That is, for Ortega, analysis of being and the analysis\nof human life constituted at once the systematic analysis of the\nexistence of man in his “lived-relations” and his\n“being-in-the-world”. Furthermore, Ortega makes explicit\nthe connection between the concept of historical time and the concept\nof everyday reality in that temporality constitutes the basic relation\nbetween human beings and their activities in the world. \nHistory narrates the actions of individuals in society. In the world\nof physical objects, things change, but in the social world of\nindividuals, events happen. References to historical reality, or to\nhistorical time, then, are defined in terms of human motives, actions,\nand reactions and therefore as unique events. What, then, are\nhistorical facts? To Ortega, “all knowledge of facts” as\n“isolated” data, “is, to be precise,\nincomprehensible and can be justified only when used in the service of\ntheory”. Our capacity to comprehend the connectedness in the\nexternal world is served best “in the synthesis of facts”,\nfor “the unity of facts” is “found not in\nthemselves” but is found “in the mind of an\nindividual” (Obras, I: 316–17). For Ortega,\nhistorical reasoning thus has a specific form of narration.  \nIn short, the reasoning, the reason, which sheds light here,\nconsists in a narrative reason. In order to comprehend anything human,\nbe it personal, or collective, it is necessary to tell its\nhistory…. Life only returns a small degree of transparency in\nthe presence of historical reason. (Obras, VI:\n40) \nThese statements were based on the recognition that historical time\ndiffers from time in nature. Clearly, any natural phenomenon occurs in\ntime. Nevertheless, references to historical reality or to a\nhistorical time often have been defined in terms of human motives,\nactions and reactions. For this reason, historical events have often\nbeen characterized as unique events, in contrast to the laws of nature\nwhere similar elements meet under similar circumstances. The history\nof the individual therefore means more than mere change in time.\nHistorical time becomes meaningful through human actions. In\nconnecting historical reasoning to human actions, critical philosophy\nof history sought to disclose the mind's activity as a tangible\nprocess. As with Dilthey, Croce, and later, Collingwood, Ortega in his\nphilosophical orientation was affiliated with the tradition which, by\nway of contrast with classical British empiricism, portrayed the human\nmind in active terms; in other words, the Neo-Kantian tradition\ntreated mental activity as creative and self-determining, displaying a\nconstructive role in human experience rather than passively responding\nin mechanical fashion to the promptings of external stimuli. Kant had\nalready established that all knowledge is a function of the human\nmind. The mind, by means of its own a priori forms,\nstructures the entire domain of knowledge. This formal extension of\nthe domain of mental activity appealed to Ortega. The particular\nimportance Ortega ascribed to history, and his contention that the\nmind's character had been radically misinterpreted by empiricist\nphilosophers, reflected the presupposition underlying his portrayal of\nthe individual as an autonomous historical agent. He viewed the\nempirical, or positivistic, objective of formulating a theory of human\nnature in accordance with principles drawn from the physical sciences\nas providing faulty findings. In adopting this position, one assumes\nthat human behavior becomes subject to invariant, universal\nregularities, and that explanations necessarily consist in subsuming\nwhat occurs beneath “a general law of nature”. Against\nsuch a view, Ortega argued that human nature involves a continual\nprocess of reflective self-transformation which reveals individuals to\nbe continually modifying and reformulating their experiences. In this\nconnection, the notion of a fixed human character, conforming to\nimmutable principles which are valid for all individuals during all\nhistorical periods, was unacceptable to him. \nTo explain reality, Ortega continued, the natural sciences, in their\nconcern with the existence of objects in natural phenomena, aim at\ndiscovering the general concepts or the natural laws under which these\nobjects may be subsumed. In order to understand the relationship\nbetween human life and reality, therefore, the individual must escape\nfrom what he labels, “the terrorism of the laboratory”.\nThrough his various readings of Kant, Ortega learned that the\nautonomous mind must liberate the self from the enslavement of our\nempirical existence by nature. To avert compounding the ontological\ndistinctions he thought should be made between a philosophy of\nphysical nature and a philosophy of human nature, Ortega maintained\nthat “man has no nature”. The individual must liberate\nhimself or herself from the shackles of the natural scientists for the\nlatter are too involved with general, abstract concepts of nature, and\n“man has no nature”. In this sense, according to Ortega,\nthe generalized interpretations of the natural scientists exclude the\nmost essential element of human reality: the life of the individual.\nIn denaturalizing “man”, a question still remains for us:\nif the individual has no nature, what does he or she have? “Man\nhas history” Ortega replies. “Man lives”, he\ncontinues, and, as a “living being”, the individual\nrelates to other “living beings” so that vital, operative\nfactors are set in motion—the “living experience of\nman”. Ortega's departure from physics and mathematics' universal\nperspective of reality shows us that his dictum, “man, in word,\nhas no nature; what he has is …history”, completes the\nalienation of the individual from nature and nature from the\nindividual. This abrupt separation of individual and nature, in\naddition to his rejection of rational concepts as producing any valid\nknowledge of reality, reaffirms Ortega's denial of universal,\nfundamental principles of reality and thus aligns him on the\nhumanistic side of the natural sciences—human sciences\ndichotomy. What is real and what has history comprises what has been\ndisclosed by human beings. History, therefore, “sensu\nstricto” constitutes “human history”. For\nhistory “is the reality of man. He has no other. Through history\nhe has made himself such as he is”. To Ortega, human life is\n“not a thing” but “a drama”; human life\n“is a gerund, not a participle: a faciendum, not a\nfactum”. Finally, as expressed differently by\nCollingwood: “what nature is to things, history, as res\ngestae, is to man…. Man finds that he has no nature other\nthan what he has done himself”. For Collingwood, history is the\nstudy of “res gestae: actions of human beings done in\nthe past”; and, because it studies human activity, it is the\nstudy of purposive activity (Obras, VI: 32–33, 41;\nCollingwood 1948 [1956: 9]; 1921 [1966:19-20]). \nThe individual thus lives in an active and disclosing way. The\ndisclosure concerns first and foremost the individual himself or\nherself. The individual basically understands his or her own being, an\nunderstanding which, according Ortega, does not belong to the common\nlife of man in general; rather, it belongs solely to each unique\nindividual (Obras, VI: 25). It is only within his or her own\nfactual existence that the individual can fathom “I am I and my\ncircumstances”. The individuation of the individual's being is\nthat which identifies what he or she may become. If the\n“circumstances” of the individual connote, for Ortega, any\nsituation toward which an act may be directed by the “I”,\nthen circumstances, for the most part, constitute more a condition,\nand not a denial, of the individual's freedom of action. That is to\nsay, once it is established that freedom entails choice, a choice must\nbe made with respect to the variety of possibilities which arise out\nof the “circumstances” of the individual. To create his\ndestiny so that he may become “the novelist of himself”,\nthe individual “must choose among these possibilities”.\n“Therefore”, Ortega argued, “I am free. But\nunderstand it well, I am free by coercion, whether I want to be or\nnot”. The conditions of freedom evolve within given alternatives\nand freedom of action, and thereby result in the ability to choose and\nact under whatever confronting circumstances that may arise. Thus, for\nOrtega, how an individual constitutes himself or herself becomes\ndetermined very much by the way in which one allows for the possession\nof his or her being. The individual has not chosen freely his or her\n“circumstances;” nevertheless, each can freely take over\nthe responsibility of his or her being and allow it to disclose itself\nas uniquely his or hers. “Man's destiny, then”, he\nposited, “is primarily action. We do not live to think, on the\ncontrary: we think in order that we may succeed in surviving”\n(Obras, VI: 34; 5: 304). For once given his life, man's being\nor essence becomes an ever-changing reality. As man's essence becomes\ncharacterized in conjunction with the conditions of his\n“circumstances”, individual man is placed into and\ndelivered over to the being which is his and which he has to be. In\nthis manner, the burden of action and decision-making is placed upon\nthe individual as the very essence of one's being consists in an\never-changing reality in the making. One's ability to be this or that\nbeing is contingent upon his or her actions, and thus for Ortega, the\nindividual is fundamentally different from animals and stones: \nThis life that is given to us is given to us empty, and man has to go\non filling it for himself, occupying it. Such is our occupation. This\nis not the case with the stone, the plant, and the animal. Their being\nis given already to them predetermined and resolute…But man is\ngiven the necessity of having to be doing something always, upon pain\nof succumbing, yet what he has to do is not present to him from the\noutset and once and for all. Because the most strange and most\nconfounding thing about this circumstance or world in which we have to\nlive consists in the fact that it always presents to us, within its\ninexorable circle or horizon, a variety of possibilities for our\naction, a variety in the face of which we are obliged to choose and,\ntherefore, to exercise our freedom. The circumstance—I\nrepeat—the here and now within which we are inexorably inscribed\nand imprisoned, does not at each moment impose on us a single act or\nactivity but various possible acts or activities and cruelly leaves us\nto our own initiative and inspiration, hence to our own responsibility\n(Obras, VII: 102–03). \nExistentialist philosophers are noted for their emphasis on freedom of\naction and the necessity for the individual to choose what he or she\nwill be; it becomes apparent, from the above statement, that Ortega\nhas absorbed this intellectual tradition into his own philosophy.\nClearly, other philosophers have been concerned with the nature of\nhuman freedom preceding the philosophical activity in Europe from the\nlate 1920s to the 1950s. However, the central interest which unites\nOrtega and existential philosophy concerns not only the issue of human\nfreedom, but also an emphasis on the experience and practice of it.\nThis being the case, the essence of man's being takes on a dual\ncharacteristic in Ortega's philosophy of human life, the\ndifferentiation between the internal trait of the individual—the\n“I”—and its external manifestation within the\nenvironment of physical entities. He views the “I” both as\nconstituting and as being constituted by the tangible reality of the\nworld. Life as the confrontation of the “I” with its\nenvironment—environments in which various possibilities\nexist—places man outside himself. As we observed,\n“possibility” connotes, for Ortega, that which possesses\npotential actuality (from the viewpoint of the individual's\n“circumstances”). From this point of view of the\ncircumstantialities of life, taking into account the “I”\nas the prime human reality is not sufficient unto itself since the\nrealization of this factor of life spurs the individual into action\nand thereby confronts him or her with external reality\n(Obras, V: 72–73). Thus, continual confrontation with\nhis “circumstances” demonstrates the essential factor that\nprevents the individual from being isolated, locked in his or her ego.\nThe individual must act in life and, under such conditions, the living\nexperience becomes a task and the individual becomes what the\npotential possibilities of his or her finite being exhibit him or her\nto be. \nThe essential finitude of the individual is experienced at the very\nheart of life itself. “Life is anguish”, he remarked,\n“and enthusiasm and delight and bitterness and innumerable\nthings”. According to Ortega, at a certain point during his or\nher experience, the individual may plunge into the mood of\nanxiety—as if he or she were “between the sword and the\nwall”—when death becomes imminent. “Death”, he\ncontinued, “is certain, there is no escaping it! Could there be\nless choice?” (Obras, VIII: 297; VII: 104). Ortega\nperceived the reality and the fact of death as essential in revealing\nthe very essence and contingency of the individual's being, which\nresembles similar views expressed by Heidegger. For, in the face of\n“possible death”, to experience life as being also implies\nan awareness of the possibility of life as not being. The acceptance\nof death, therefore, as a possible here-and-now discloses the\nradical—basic—finitude of human life. \nThe perceptible factual occurrence of death also characterizes human\nlife as an occurrence of time as well as reality. As the individual\nbecomes aware of the reality of death, through experience, his or her\nfiniteness discloses itself essentially in time: \nOur vital knowledge of other men and of ourselves is open knowledge\nthat is never stable…. Our vital knowledge is open, floating\nbecause the theme for this knowledge, life, Man, is already in itself\na being ever open to new possibilities. \nOur past undoubtedly weighs on us; it inclined us to be more this than\nthat in the future, but it does not chain us nor drag us…. Life\nis change; it is at every new moment becoming something distinct from\nwhat it was, therefore, it never becomes definitely itself.\nOnly death, by preventing any new change, changes man into the\ndefinitive and immutable himself…from the moment we begin to\nbe, death may intervene into the very substance of our life,\ncollaborate in it, compress it and densify it, may make it urgency\nimminence and the need of doing our best at every instant.\n(Obras, VII: 186–87) \nThis characterization of human life, then, posits the notion that time\nis in man, for the events in men's lives are related by their position\nin time. “I am I and my circumstances”, as the starting\npoint of the human condition, also expresses the fact that the living\nexperience of the individual consists of something that takes place\ntemporally as well as spatially. What does “I am I and my\ncircumstances” imply, then, in this sense? Ortega's emphasis on\nman as a being-that-lives-in-the-world may suggest something like a\npurpose, an end; however, a specific end was never his intended\npurpose. The here-and-now of the individual becomes his primary\nconcern. Indeed, he tended to define individuals'\n“circumstances” in terms of “certain elemental,\nbasic phenomena that involve human society” and that in actual\nfact imposes themselves from the outside on the historical process\nthat he theoretically followed from within. As the temporality of man\nis very much a part of the here-and-now, man's being-in-the-making,\nfor Ortega, constitutes a “happening” toward the future.\nThe future is not-here-yet and the past is no-longer-here and these\ntwo features tend to permeate the very center of man's being as their\npositions are related to each other in time. As death relates to the\nindividual's internal finitude, the past and present relate to his or\nher finitude in its external, temporal manifestation. The\npresent—the here-and-now—becomes understood as that moment\nduring which the past and future are divided. The life of the present\nmoment—when “some men are born and when some men\ndie”—in its very essence “is boxed in”, Ortega\naverred, “between other lives which came before or which are to\ncome after…” (Obras, V: 35–37). Once an\nindividual becomes aware of himself or herself as a being based on the\nfacts of his or her past (such facts as where one was born or who\none's parents were), and also as projected towards the future which he\nor she chooses, the individual will assume full responsibility for his\nor her life and choices. Ortega viewed the future as the more\nimportant aspect of temporality because it is the “open\narea” toward which man directs himself and in which man\nmanifests his own being. The individual directs himself or herself\ntoward the future and, accordingly, takes upon himself or herself the\ninheritance of the past, thereby becoming oriented to his or her\nactual and present predicament. In short, the present originates from\nthe past so as to engender the future. \nOrtega's schematization of the past, present and future is sustained\nin the unity of a temporality that assumes peculiar features in the\nexperience of the individual's vital dimensions. Through living\nexperiences, “man goes on being and un-being”. Hence, the\ntemporal experience of living is not structured in a one-dimensional\nprogression. Rather, as a continual process of being and not-being, it\nhas to be viewed from the three-dimensional perspective of past,\npresent and future. The individual reflects upon the past as he or she\nconfronts continually the situation of having to make conscious\ndecisions with respect to the present and the future. As we have\nlearned, life, death, free choice, and finitude dwell together in the\nliving experiences of individuals. Man's choice and\n“destiny”, then, are contemporaneous—embedded in the\nhere-and-now. Accordingly, the contemporaneity of man presupposes the\nauthentic temporality of man: \nThe past is the moment of identity in man, the inexorable and fatal.\nBut, for the same reason, if man's only Eleatic being is what\nhe has been, this means that his authentic being, what, in effect, he\nis—and not merely “has been”—is distinct from\nthe past, and consists precisely and formally in “being what one\nhas not been”, in non-Eleatic being. And since the term\n“being” is occupied irresistibly by its traditional static\nsignification, one should agree to liberate oneself of it. Man is not,\nsave the he “goes on being” this and that.\n(Obras, VI: 39) \nAuthentic being, thus understood, has its essential weight not solely\nin the past, nor in the future, but in the individual's\nhere-and-now—the present in its reflexive connection with the\npast. Hence, as an authentic being, man is as contemporary as he is\nhistorical, and thereby the historicity of man makes explicit the\ntemporal manifestations of his vital dimensions. \nThrough the “I” and its “circumstances”,\nOrtega balanced the principle of individual variety with his\nphilosophy of human life. However, in considering the individual to be\na historical being occasioned by his or her temporality, Ortega began\nto pursue a line of thought that would eventually position him to\nestablish a principle of coherence for the realities of the\nindividual, society and history; this theme would be borne out of the\nphenomenological thrust of Ortega's philosophy of human society and\nhis theory of generations. For life, as the process of happening and\nthe temporality of the individual, makes implicit the assumption that\n“man goes on being” and thus has a discernible principle\nof coherence. \nOnce human life has been established as the fundamental standpoint of\nreality, for Ortega,  \nwe are ipso facto given two terms or factors that are equally\nprimary and, moreover, inseparable: Man, who lives, and the\ncircumstances or world in which man lives.  \nAs a being that lives, the individual relates to other living beings.\nFor Ortega, “all realities must in some way make themselves\npresent, or at least announce themselves within the shaken boundaries\nof our human life”. Hence, the basic reality of human life\nconstitutes the life of an individual with the lives of other\nindividuals as well as situations that pertain to the confrontation of\nthe individual with the existent realities of physical objects. In\naccordance with this viewpoint, man—as a\nbeing-that-lives-in-the-world—does not perceive the world from\nthe isolation of his ego, for the very essence of his being consists\nin living in an actively disclosing manner. For Ortega,\nbeing-in-the-world has a dual characteristic: as it relates to\n“I am I”, being-in-the-world functions as\nbeing-for-itself; but as it relates to “my circumstances”,\nbeing-in-the-world functions as being-for-and-with-others. “Our\nworld”, he explained,  \nthe world of each one of us, is not totum revolutum, but is\norganized in “pragmatic fields”. Each thing belongs to one\nor some of these fields, in which it articulates its\nbeing-for with that of others, and so on successively.\n(Obras, VII: 130)  \nThrough an approach reminiscent of Kant and Husserl, Ortega posited\nthe fact that “all men live in one and the same world”. He\ncontinued,  \nThis is the attitude that we may call the natural, normal and everyday\nattitude in which we live; and, because of it, because of living\nwith others in a presumed world—hence our\nworld—our living is co-living, living together.\n(Obras, VII: 152) \nAny meaningful interaction with the other “consists in my\nrelation with becoming active, in my acting on him and his on me. In\npractice, the former usually follows upon the latter”. In this\nmanner, then, the discovery of the body of the other, as an object in\nreality, becomes a reverse revelation of the “I” and its\nbeing. The being which is subsequently revealed to the “I”\nis revealed as being-for-and-with-others. This component of\nbeing-for-itself-and-others is an integral part of being-in-the-world\nand being-for-itself and, thereby provided Ortega with the\nphenomenological perspective through which he developed his idea of\nindividuals interacting in human society. He explains: \nThis means that the appearance of the Other is a fact that always\nremains as it were at the back of our life, because on becoming aware\nfor the first time that we are living, we already find ourselves, not\nonly with others and among others, but accustomed to others. Which\nleads us to formulate this first social theorem: Man is a\nnativitate open to the other, to the alien being; or, in\nother words: before each one of us became aware of himself,\nhe had already had the basic experience that there are others who are\nnot “I”, the Others; that is to say, again, Man, on being\na nativitate open to the other, to the alter who is\nnot himself is a nativitate, like it or not…. Being\nopen to the other, to others, is a permanent and constitutive state of\nMan, not a definite action in respect to them. … This state is\nnot yet properly a “social relation”, because it is not\nyet defined in any concrete act. It is simple co-existence, matrix for\nall possible “social relations”. It is simple presence\nwithin the horizon of my life—a presence which is, above all,\nmore compresence of the Other, singular or plural. (Obras,\nVII: 149–50) \nFor Ortega, the notion of the social world as a horizon connotes a\nmanner quite similar to that of Husserl, the context in which the\nexperience of human interaction (among “I”, and\n“We” and “Other”) occurs. The various\n“I's” constitute the fundamental units of the structure\nand content of the social world. “Husserl says very well”,\nOrtega recalled, “the meaning of the term man implies a\nreciprocal existence of one for the other, hence, a community of\nmen, a society” (Obras, VII: 148). As we saw\npreviously, in describing reality, Ortega postulated the distinction\nbetween things (i.e., plants, stones and animals) and man through the\nfact that things exist and man lives. By dint of his unique\nindividuality, man has an essence that is peculiarly his own, which\nmeans that man, for Ortega, is not only split off from\nnature—plants, stones, minerals and the like. All individual\nhuman acts, for him, are directed toward some object and, as such, the\nactions of the individual are manifested in accord with the nature of\nthe objects toward which they are directed and in accord with their\nphysical, spatial context. If the object is a stone, the individual's\nactions would be unilateral; if the object is an animal, on the other\nhand, the individual discovers that his actions would be manifested\ntoward an anticipated reaction by the animal to which they are\ndirected: \nWe know that a stone is not aware of our action on it…. But as\nsoon as we begin dealing with an animal, the relation changes….\nThere is, then, no doubt that, in my relation with the animal, the act\nof my behavior toward it is not, as it was in the case of the stone,\nunilateral; rather, my act, before being performed, when I am planning\nit, already calculates with the probable act of reaction on the\nanimal's part, in such a manner that my act, even in the state of pure\nproject, moves toward the animal but returns to me in an inverted\nsense, anticipating the animal's reply. (Obras, VII:\n133–34) \nWe find this sort of transcendental reflection—by way of action,\nresponses and reciprocal responses—to be fundamental in the kind\nof description made by Ortega of the social world. With an animal as\nan object toward which an individual may direct his or her acts, one\nfinds more of a reciprocal response than occurs with stones and other\ninanimate objects. Individual man and an animal, according to Ortega,\nexist-for-each-other but not to the same degree as between man and\nman, as the latter relate to one another as\nbeing-with-and-for-the-other. Yet the question remains: what kind of\nbehavior can be constituted as being social and what are the\ncontingencies implicit in this behavior? The contingency, for Ortega,\nrelates to the fact that social behavior entails interaction between\nindividuals, in contrast to acts between men and animals—for he\nviews human life as the ultimate reality—and this human\ninteraction has to be reciprocal. It is a kind of reciprocity of\naction that can only arise and occur amongst individual men: \nDoes not the word “social” immediately point to a reality\nconsisting in the fact that man conducts himself in confrontation with\nother beings which, in their turn, conduct themselves with respect to\nhim—therefore, to actions in which, in one way or another, the\nreciprocity intervenes…in short, to say the same thing in\nanother way, that the two actors mutually respond to each other, that\nis, they correspond? (Obras, VII: 135–37) \nOrtega holds that upon experiencing the others as other men, the\n“I” understands and relates to them as units that are\nanalogous to the “I” and are inextricably connected, as\nfundamental units of reality, to their “circumstances” as\nwell. This interaction manifests itself in such a manner that the\n“I”, for Ortega, apprehends the world-about-the-others and\nthe world-about-the-“I” as one and the same\nworld—from an objective, empirical standpoint—that differs\nin each individual case only insofar as it affects consciousness\ndifferently. For we all perceive reality through our sense-perception,\nalbeit our individual perceptions of this very reality are registered\ndifferently. For Ortega, as we have seen, I am the only one who is an\n“I”. All the other “I's” are similar to\nobjects (in the sense that they are perceived solely as physical\norganisms) and, once viewed as being “an other\nperson” (that is, a being perceived as possessing both a\nbody and an inwardness, an other “I”), are\nreferred to as the “others”. My own place in this\nworld—in time and space—is related to my “I”\nand my body. Therefore, when the “ego” (which is my\n“I”) encounters an “alien ego”, it is\nessential for it (the “ego”) to transcend itself and\nthereby make possible meaningful attempts to understand and perceive\nthe existence of other “egos”, or “I's”. The\n“other”, as “I”, according to Ortega, embodies\nan “ego” that possesses a similar quality of\nconsciousness, inwardness and solitude: an ego that will be related to\nas also possessing both primary and secondary qualities and whose\nfundamental essence and structure will also be encountered as existent\nwithin the “I”. Thus, for Ortega, in order to attempt to\nenter this sphere of the “other's inwardness”, it becomes\nessential to strive toward attaining the transcendental attitude.\n“In this sense of radical reality”, he explained, \n“human life” means strictly and exclusively the life of\neach individual, that is, always and only my life…. If, by\nchance—I added—appears in this my world something that\nmust also be called “human life” in another sense, neither\nradical nor primary nor patent, but secondary, derivative and more or\nless latent and hypothetical… What is decisive in this step and\nin this appearance is that when my life and everything in it, on being\npatent to me, on being mine, have immanent character—hence the\ntruism that my life is immanent to itself, that it is all within\nitself—the indirect presentation, or compresence, of the alien\nhuman life startles and confronts me with something transcendent to my\nown life…. (Obras, VII: 141) \nThrough the mediacy of a human world, then, the “I” and\nthe other, as collective human lives, communicate. The radical reality\nof the “I”, as the inwardness of human life, is unique to\nthe individual “I”, and, to the extent possible, relates\ntranscendentally to the “I” of the other. The\nconsciousness of the “I” becomes separated from the\nconsciousness of the other by the very distinction that separates, in\nthe first instance, the “I's” consciousness of its own\nbody, and secondly, the distinction that separates the body of the\n“I” from the body of the other, and finally, the\ndistinction that separates the other's body from its consciousness.\nAlternatively, the bodies of the “I” and the other, as\nexistent physical structures in the common world of “human\nlives”, are necessary “broadcasting centers”, as\nOrtega calls it, between the consciousness of the “I” and\nthe others. In this connection, the relations between the bodies of\nthe “I” and the other consists of a relation of\ntranscendental exteriority. “What is certainly patent in my\nlife”, he explained,  \nis the notification, the signal, that there are other human lives; but\nsince human life in its radicality is only mine, and these\nwill be lives of others like myself, each the life of each, it follows\nthat, because they are others, all their lives will be situated\noutside of or beyond or trans-mine. Hence they are\ntranscendent. (Obras, VII: 142) \nExpressed in this manner, the individual, as a\nbeing-who-lives-in-the-world and as a being-for-and-with-others, is an\nempirically finite being who has to transcend the finitude of his\n“radical reality”. As we have seen, from the perspective\noften associated with existential philosophy, Ortega averred that for\nthe individual to transcend the determinacy of his or her being and\nattain individual consciousness, he or she has to make free choices\nand decisions. From an ontological point of view, Ortega makes a case,\nlike Husserl, for the necessity of entering the transcendental\nattitude so that the individual may bring himself closer to an\nunderstanding and consciousness of the experience of the\n“other”. The phenomenological and existential philosophies\nare thus linked together, for the individual remains an empirical,\nfinite, concrete, and unique being in his particular\n“circumstances” who has been placed decisively within the\nspatiotemporal context of the world of his here-and-now. From this\nperspective, man transcends his “radical reality” in its\nevery detail (Obras, V: 545–47). Although he called\ninto question the “abstract analogical transposition” of\nHusserl's “transcendental reduction”, Ortega's\nphenomenological approach to the importance of transcending individual\nexperience—as the fundamentals basis for understanding the very\nexperience of reality—still remains very much within the\ntradition of Husserl and his students of the phenomenological method:\nHeidegger, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. When Ortega presented the\nontological ramifications of reality, clearly he considered the human\nbody to be connected to the totality of what he called human life or\nradical reality and, as such, to be the foundation of its vital\nstructure. More specifically: the body is a body of an individual\ninsofar as it exists in the indissoluble unity of its radical reality.\nBut, he questioned, “what do we mean when we say that an Other\nis before us, that is, an other like myself, another Man?” His\nanswer,  \n…I, ego, means for us no more than “human life”,\nand human life…is properly, originally, and radically only the\nlife of each of us, hence, my life. (Obras, VII:\n158–59) \nTo some, it would appear to be an obvious fact that man is able to\nunderstand others in their being and essence, both as alike and other\nthan himself. From a phenomenological standpoint, however, this fact\nis a problem which is neither obvious nor easy to explain, and it is a\nproblem whose solution was viewed differently by both Ortega and\nHusserl. For Husserl, the solution to this problem was found in his\nnotion of Einfühlung (“empathy”, or\nliterally, “feeling oneself into another”). Husserl's\nconcept of the Einfühlung in Lebenswelt\nresembles Hume's idea of “sympathy”, and its philosophical\nfunction (as a propensity “to sympathize with others”, and\nas a “transcendental theory of experiencing someone else”)\nwas to establish, as thoroughly as possible, a way of presenting the\n“other” to us. (see Hume 1739 [1985: 367–69]).\nOrtega renounced the supposition inherent in this solution to the\nproblem because the notion of Einfühlung assumes that\nthe “other” is “analogous” to my\n“I”; it is assumed, for him, that it is a double of my\n“I” and still does not serve the function of explaining\nthe most difficult question—namely, how is it possible that this\n“double” of myself continues to appear to me as\nconstituting the other? The main thrust of Ortega's argument is\ndirected against Husserl's formulation of the alter ego as\n“an analogue” of the ego in Cartesian\nMeditations. The solution of “an analogical transposition\nor projection”, therefore proved inadequate for Ortega, and the\nnotion of the “appearance of the Other” became the problem\nto which he extended his existential-phenomenological position of\nbeing-for-itself and being-for-and-with-others. Ortega replaced\nHusserl's notion of “in [my] every intentionality”, in\norder to clarify the problem somewhat, with his own idea of “my\nlife as radical reality” (see especially Husserl 1933 [1964:\n89–100, 104–11]; ZPI: vol. 14, 3–11, 429–33;\nvol. 15, 40–50; see also, Scheler 1923 [1954: 6–50];\nObras, VII: 161–63). As man is never a wordless\n“I”—for, as radical reality his life is\nbeing-in-the-world—also he is never an isolated (other-less)\n“I”. For Ortega, this manifestation of “radical\nrealty” constitutes the fundamental feature of\nbeing-for-and-with-others and consequently cannot be explained as an\nisolated “I” that somehow discovers a way of confronting\nanother equally isolated “I”. Man does not have to find\nhis way to another man for, with the disclosure of his own being as\nbeing-for-and-with-others, the being of other “I's”\nbecomes disclosed to him as possessing this identical feature: \nObserve then: being the other does not represent an accident or\nadventure that may or may not befall Man, but is an original\nattribute. I, in my solitude, could not call myself by a generic name\nlike “man”. The reality represented by this name appears\nto me only when there is another being who responds or reciprocates to\nme. Husserl says very well: “The meaning of the term\n‘man’ implies a reciprocal existence of one for the other,\nhence a community of men, a society”. And conversely:\n“It is equally clear that men cannot be apprehended unless there\nare (really or potentially) other men around them”.\nHence—I add—to speak of man outside and apart from a\nsociety is to say something that is self-contradictory and\nmeaningless…. Man does not appear in\nsolitude—although his ultimate truth is solitude; man appears in\nsociality as the Other, frequenting the One, as the reciprocator\n(Obras, VII: 148). \nThe “I” and the other, then, are constituted by their\nappearance before each other, in the common world of society, and as\neach engages in reciprocal interaction. In this connection, Ortega was\nin basic agreement with Husserl as he attempted to reconcile the\nrealms of “I” and other, solitude and society, by\nestablishing the fact that a referral to the other (on the part of the\n“I”) is an indispensable condition for the constitution of\nbeing-in-the-world. \nThus, in the social world of being-for-and-with-others, an individual\ndirects himself away from the possibilities that may be viewed as\nbeing exclusively his own and attempts to broaden his understanding of\nhimself by relating to the common world possibilities of others. The\nsocial world in which the individual lives—as one who remains\nlinked with other individuals through manifold relations—becomes\na realm that he apprehends and interprets to be meaningful for his\npossibilities, his “circumstances” and his here-and-now.\nAdopting this standpoint, Ortega contended that as individuals who are\nrooted in our radical realities, we must “make an attempt at\ninterpenetration, at de-solitudinizing\nourselves…” (Obras, VII: 140). This being the\ncase, as the spatiotemporal dimension of man's radical reality become\npart and parcel of his here-and-now, the reality of the social world\n(as the context and mediacy through which groups of individuals\ninteract) is also enmeshed in his here-and-now. Through his own\nfinitude, the individual's temporality revealed itself as the\nconsciousness of the intrasubjective structure of his life. The\nreality of the social world, conversely, reveals itself to the\nindividual as an intersubjectively structured world which the\n“I” shared with the others. The spatiotemporal\nmanifestations of this intersubjectivity connect the “I”\nto the others and, at the same time, sharply differentiate the world\nof the “I” from the social world of the others. “The\nfirst thing”, he explained,  \nI fall foul of in my proper and radical world is Other Men, the Other\nsingular and plural, among whom I am born and begin to live. From the\nbeginning, then, I find myself in a human world or society.\n(Obras, VII: 177) \nIn the context of social reality, the individual therefore measures\nhis “I” by what constitutes the Others and what they have\nachieved and failed to achieve in the social world. The experience of\nthe social world by the “I” thereby justifies and\ncorroborates itself (as a being-in-the-world) through the experience\nof the others with whom the “I” interacts. The\npossibilities of the individual and his subsequent understanding of\nhimself can be broadened after his encounter with the\n“others” in the social world that is common to all\n“I's”. However, Ortega also views the social world as\nconstricting, and not expanding, man's possibilities in several\naspects. As an empirically finite being whose radical reality\ncontinually confronts the possibility of death, man, for Ortega, can\nmake efforts to transcend the determinacy of his being on making,\nexistentially, free choices and decisions. Conversely, man, as a\nsocial and empirically finite being interrelated to other individuals,\nfinds it difficult to transcend and recoil from the process of the\nreciprocity of human interaction in the context of social reality and,\nhence, becomes conditioned (by society) to act with a view toward what\nothers have done and are currently doing. Once given this social world\nthat may be interpreted to signify the possible realm of action for\nall of us (as “all men find themselves among men”), in\nOrtega's view, the individual must discriminate between what\nconstitutes the possibilities of the others—men in general in\nthe social world—and what constitutes the possibilities inherent\nin the uniqueness of his own finite being. “What is\nyours”, he said,  \ndoes not exist for me—your ideas and convictions do not exist\nfor me. I see them as alien and something as opposed to me….\nAll Yous are such—because they are different from me—and\nwhen I say I, I am only a minute portion of the world, the tiny part\nof it that I now begin accurately to call “I”.\n(Obras, VII: 178, 189–90) \nIn this connection, the individual must live neither as an isolated\n“I” nor as a conformist to the common social world of the\nothers. Rather, the individual must live the existence of a unique\n“I”. That is to say, the unique individual consists of he\nwho lives in an actively disclosing manner and has the ability both to\ncome out of and to withdraw into the possibilities which are permitted\nwithin the realm of the “yous” and\n“wes” that he confronts in the reality of the\nsocial world. “It is in the world of the yous, and by virtue of\nthem”, he exclaimed,  \nthat the thing I am, my I, gradually takes shape for me. I discover\nmyself, then, as one of countless yous, but as different from\nthem all, with gifts and defects of my own, with a unique character\nand conduct, that together draw my authentic and correct profile for\nme—hence as another and particular you, as alter tu.\n(Obras, VII: 196)  \nAt this point of our analysis, it is apparent that the term\n“social world”, or society, for Ortega, connotes merely\nthe term which is used to describe the phenomenological interaction\nbetween individual “I's” both as unique individuals and as\nsocial individuals. In other words, the social world entails the realm\nin which the interactive process of the “I” and its\n“circumstances” becomes extended to the inclusion of other\n“I's”. From this perspective, Ortega became concerned with\nthe fundamental patterns of human interaction that underlie the larger\ncontext of social reality. The reduction of the whole of what\nconstitutes social reality into its component elements discloses the\nphenomenological basis of Ortega's analysis of human society. Hence,\nthe social relation of individuals identifies the distinctive unity\nwhich is defined by the reciprocal interaction of its unique\nindividual components. As he explained: \n…the basic structure that is social relation, in which man\nmoves appearing and defining himself in front of the other man, and\nfrom being the pure other, the unknown man, the not-yet-identified\nindividual, becomes the unique individual—the You and I. But now\nwe have become aware of something that is a constituent factor in all\nthat we have called “social relation”…namely, that\nall these actions of ours and all these reactions of others in which\nthe so-called “social relation” consists, originate in an\nindividual as such, I [myself] for example, and are directed to\nanother individual as such. Therefore, the “social\nrelation”, as it has so far appeared to us, is always explicitly\na reality between individuals, a reality formally inter-individual.\n(Obras, VII: 202–3) \nThe behavior and interaction of individuals in the social world, for\nOrtega, comprise a reality which becomes tangible and open to\nobjective analysis. This analysis reflects the perspective of social\nreality as the realm in which we may perceive and interpret the\nconcrete functions of human interactions. The substance of Ortega's\nobjective analysis of social relations was structured around his\ntheories of “creative, select minorities”, “mass\nman”, and “mass society”. For Ortega, “mass\nman” and “mass society” are manifestations of social\nand historical phenomena that are perceptible, in part, through the\nobjective factor of their vast numbers and magnitude in the social\nworld. But, he points out immediately, the argument of sheer quantity\nhardly explains accurately or adequately the fact that “we see\nthe multitude, as such, in possession of the places and instruments\ncreated by civilization”. More importantly, he averred, a sharp\nfocus on the intrinsic features of mass man and mass society would\nbring us much closer to discerning the essence of this concept than\nits external manifestations of agglomeration and plenitude\n(Obras, VII: 144, 143). The philosophical dimensions of mass\nman, mass society and select minorities, as a theory of social\nrelations and human interaction and also as an analysis of social\nreality, must focus more attention on its qualitative characteristics\nthan its quantitative characteristics. That is, while making\nreferences to the quantitative factor of the concepts of masses and\nselect minorities as descriptive indicators of the coherence of one\ngroup of individuals vis-à-vis another group remains important\nand useful, references to the qualitative features of identifying what\nconstitute masses and select minorities becomes even more essential\ntoward an understanding not solely of unique individuals in society\nbut also of how these unique persons remain together as a dynamic\nunity. \nThe concept of the multitude is quantitative and visual. If we\ntranslate the concept into sociological terminology without changing\nits character, then we find the idea of social mass. Society is always\na dynamic unity of two component factors: minorities and masses. The\nminorities are individuals or groups of individuals who are specially\nqualified. The mass is an aggregate of persons not especially\nqualified. By masses, then, it is not to be understood, solely nor\nprincipally, “the working masses”. The mass is “the\naverage man”. In this manner, what was mere quantity—the\nmultitude—is converted into a qualitative determination: it\nbecomes the common social quality, man as undifferentiated from other\nmen, but as repeating in himself a generic type…To form a\nminority, whatever it may be, it is necessary beforehand that each\nmember separate himself from the multitude for special,\nrelatively individual reasons…. This coming together of the\nminority precisely in order to separate themselves from the majority\nis always introduced into the formation of every minority.\n(Obras, IV: 145–46) \nFor Ortega, the “specially qualified”, “select\nman”, must separate himself from the common values of everyone\nby placing greater demands on himself and by drawing upon the\nuniqueness of his radical reality. As we saw, to realize one's\npossibilities as a unique individual, one must occasionally withdraw\nfrom the social reality of others to the radical reality of his\n“I”. According to Ortega, in such circumstances, the\nindividual has to ignore momentarily the objective values of the\nsocial world and create the increasingly subjective values derived\nfrom the uniqueness of his being. This subjective withdrawal into the\n“solitude” of one's radical reality provides the necessary\nretreat of the select minorities whenever confronted with the\nconstraints of the masses, a process which resembles Nietzsche's\nconcept of the übermensch. For Nietzsche, the\nübermensch (over man) must liberate himself from the\nressentiment of “slave morality” by setting his\nown standards and by creating his own values (Nietzsche 1887 [1969:\n36–43]). We previously observed that in order to attempt to\ndevelop individual consciousness and realize the vital possibilities\nof his being, Ortega thinks the individual has to become absorbed\nwithin the circumstances of the social world and interact actively\nwith other individuals in the world. However, the development of\nindividual consciousness and the realization of one's vital\npossibilities also entail an occasional withdrawal from social reality\ninto the solitude of one's self (without remaining “hermetically\nenclosed” and locked in the ego), with the purpose of possessing\nboth the unique individuality of the “I” (against the\nconstraints of society) and the positive process of reciprocal human\ninteraction. Although Ortega opined that “there is no creation\nwithout withdrawal into one's self”, he also maintained that the\n“I” has to confront others actively and collide in the\nstrife he designates as “social relations”. The dynamics\nof “de-solitudinizing” through actions and creations of\nthe individual in the social world, then, project the realm of\npossibilities not only from the “I” to the other and from\nthe other to the I, but also from our social world (in the\nhere-and-now) to their social world (in the future)—in short,\nfrom one generation to the next. The individual, for Ortega, must\nwithdraw from the social world not solely to realize the vital\npossibilities of his own being, but also to attempt to create and\nactualize the vital possibilities of the social world through which\nthe circumstances of his very being (and the being of the others) are\ndefined. In this context, the individual, by engaging actively in the\nsocial reality surrounding his circumstances, contributes\nsubstantively to the making of the essence of society and history as\nwell as the essence of his own being (Obras, V: 79–80).\nThe spatio-temporality of man and his circumstances—by way of\nhis life, society, consciousness of time and history—will take\nus into Ortega's concept of the “generation” and its role\nin his philosophy of history. \nThe social world and the conscious process of the individual, however,\ndisclose more than the experiences of other individuals that are\ndirectly given in the common, vivid present of the here-and-now. For\nOrtega, the social world also contains an implicit feature of social\nreality that remains inexperienced directly (in the broader sense of\nimmediate confrontation) by the individual—in the\nhere-and-now—but becomes contemporaneous with the life of the\nindividual and subsequently may be made available to him as an\nexperience in the future. Hence, the here-and-now of the individual,\nas an immediate direct experience, extends itself (both as a process\nof consciousness and as a perceptible factual occurrence in space)\ninto the broader social context of living and interacting as\n“contemporaries” (Obras, V: 36–42). In this\ncontext, the explicit features of the social reality of\n“contemporaries” reveal the conscious process of a\ngeneration of individuals as a temporal process. \nThe temporality of the lives of individuals (as\n“contemporaries” and also as what Ortega called\n“coevals”) is central to the concept of the generation. In\nthis sense, for Ortega, ultimate reality as the reality of human life\nalso signifies the explicit manifestation of time (for time is in man\nas the events of his life are connected to their placements in time)\nand thus provides him with the basic structure of his concept of\ngeneration and the basis of historic changes. The life of man, as\nbeing-in-the-making, is life as a happening, life as a changing\nstructure. With each fleeting moment of the here-and-now, man's inner\nstream of consciousness of the flow of time relates to the fact that\nhis life changes as he grows older and ages with each reference to the\nno-longer-here and the not-yet-here. “The most elemental fact of\nhuman life”, he said, \nis that some men die and others are born—that lives succeed each\nother. All human life, in its very essence, is enclosed in between\nother lives which came before or which are to come after—it\nproceeds out of one life and goes into one which is to follow. Well\nthen, it is on this most fundamental fact that I establish the\ninevitable necessity of change in the structure of the world….\nThis is not to say, heedlessly, that the youth of today—that is,\nhis soul and his body—is different from the youth of yesterday;\nbut it is inevitable that his life should have a different framework\nthan that of yesterday. \nWell then, this is nothing but to find the reason and the period for\nhistorical changes in the fact joined essentially to human life, that\nthis human life always has an age [a period of time]. Life is\ntime—as Dilthey already made us see and Heidegger repeats to us\ntoday; and not imaginary cosmic time because imaginary time is\ninfinite, but limited time, time which grows toward an end, which is\nthe true time, the irreparable time. For this reason man has age. Age\nis man's being always in a certain part of his limited\ntime-span—whether it is to be the beginning of his vital life's\ntime, to be the ascension toward the middle, to be its center, or to\nbe approaching toward its end—or, as one is accustomed to say,\nwhether he is a child, a youth, a mature man, or an old man.\n(Obras, V: 37) \nAfter having established this principle of change, Ortega's concept of\ngeneration becomes the principle through which the no-longer-here, the\nhere-and-now, and the not-yet-here converge in the temporal reality of\nthe social world. Thus, when Ortega referred to one's “life\ntime” as consisting youth, maturity and old age, we are able to\ndiscern that: in the first instance, his concept of generation entails\na horizontal reference to living individuals as being\n“contemporaries”; and, secondly, it refers to the vertical\ndifferentiation, in age, among youth, maturity and old age—in\nshort, as being “coevals”. Ortega's view of three distinct\nlife times, as manifestations of the concept of generation, resides in\nhis notions of “coevals” (which refers to the interaction\nof individuals of approximately the same age) and of\n“contemporaries” (which refers to the interaction between\nall individuals of whatever age) and their appositeness with regard to\ntime and to space (Obras, V: 37–38). As the active\nengagement in the social world persists in importance for both the\ndevelopment of the individual and society, the inner dynamics of vital\nhuman interaction, for Ortega, are also important insofar as the\nconcept of generation has any significance in illuminating the human\ncondition. Yet we ask ourselves: how do we characterize those\nindividuals who do engage actively in the “circumstances”\nof their reality but whose social worlds differ from those of other\ngroups of individuals? They may possess the same age as these other\ngroups of individuals and their activities are contemporaneous, but\nthe “vital contact” of one group of individuals who belong\nto a particular social setting does not necessarily interact with that\nof another social group, as their social worlds are different in space\nthough not in time. This question takes us into the broader historical\nimplications of Ortega's concept of generation. \nThe historical nature of human reality and social thought sheds light\non Ortega's notion that “there is no spontaneous\ngeneration”, for the “series of the generations”\nfunction through the continuity of the historical process. Social\nthought and ideas of individuals reflect “the minds of\nmen” together with the particular generations within which they\ndevelop and, if constituted as “coming from” and\n“going toward”, they become part and parcel of the\n“happening” of the historical process (Obras, VI:\n202–4). As we have seen, man's being-in-the-making, for Ortega,\n“is in man mere happening, happening to him” and,\naccordingly, a happening toward the future: the present evolves out of\nthe past and, as the reality exigent to man, veers toward the future\n(Obras, VI: 37, 40-41). This historical sense of continuity\nbetween the minds of men and the succession of generations recalls for\nus Ortega's assertion that the individual cannot live solely within\nthe isolation of his ego (whether he is a “mass” or a\n“select” man). Social thought in general, and individuals'\nideas in particular, fail to develop and expand within the solipsistic\nvacuum of the “I” by their very essence. As a being of the\nsocial world, the individual and his ideas are influenced by the\nhistorical context and the very social world within which they\nemerged, and, similarly, formed by the past. From this perspective,\nman, time, thought and society are disclosed in reality as being\nessentially historical. For Ortega, the individual is not born in some\ngeneral place and moment; rather, he or she is born in a particular\nmoment in time and at a particular place in space. Human life has a\nbeginning and an end and, on entering the world, man enters a social\nworld that is given to him in conjunction with the historical process\nof its temporal dimension. As we saw, for Ortega, “man has no\nnature…what he has is history” for, he says, “man\nis the entity that makes itself…the causa sui”.\n(Obras, VI: 33). History, then, provides the process through\nwhich the essence of man becomes manifest both as an individual and a\nsocial being. As an individual being, man undergoes the stream of\nconsciousness of an internal occurrence as a historical process; as a\nbeing-that-lives-in-the-world, man experiences the succession of\ngenerations as an external occurrence within the historical process.\nOrtega posited the “theme of history” and\n“historical thought” as proceeding “with respect to\nthe human phenomena” through the prisms of these internal and\nexternal occurrences. History, through the succession of generations,\nnot only provides us with the basic features of the individual at a\nparticular time and place, but also provides us with “a\nregulative principle” of coherence for human phenomena. The\nunity of the past and the present in history, for Ortega, constitutes\na reality which becomes identified with the experiences of\nindividuals. Like Croce, Ortega perceived history qua history as being\n“contemporary” and “living”, whereas mere\nfacts are relegated to the realm of “dead chronicle”.\nThrough the relationship of history to life, he defined history, as\ncontrasted with chronicle, by its vitality and present-mindedness\nrather than by connectedness as such, though he did acknowledge that\nthose who defined it by the latter quality pursued the correct path.\nThe contemporaneity of history, then, proffers a dynamic process that\nis ever changing and continuously absorbed by the past. The relations\nthat past events bear to other events and to the present are\nsignificant in that they are continually changing and, according to\nOrtega, the function of the philosopher becomes not only to describe\nand analyze the past but also to attempt to understand these relations\nin conjunction with human life. The underlying concept of the\nindividual ultimately determines the critical character of historical\ninterpretations, which results from both a reading of the past and\nsimultaneous self-analysis by the observer. In this critical revival\nof the past, the contemporary generation achieves a higher historical\nconsciousness of its own being. Internal consciousness of temporal\nchange within the individual coupled with an awareness of the external\nmanifestations of change in the social world of human reality dispose\none to see how Ortega's concept of the generation constitutes a\nconcept of historical methodology: \nHistorical study, thus, constitutes a humanistic enterprise.\nCurrently, history can be our approach to knowledge of the individual\nand of humanity, and through history we acquire the wealth and wisdom\nof past cultures. The critical awareness of the potentialities of the\nindividual enables us to act in our own historical time with deeper\ninsights and active commitment. History depends on what the\nconsciousness of the historian brings to it, and therefore, the\nhumanistic aspects of historical consciousness stems from the\nrealization that our lives constitute time. For the “past is\npast”, Ortega remarked,  \nnot because it happened to others but because it forms part of our\npresent, of what we are in the form of having been: in short, because\nit is our past. Life as reality is absolute presence: one\ncannot say that there is anything if it is not present, of\nthis moment. If, then, there is a past, it must be as\nsomething present, something active in us now.\n(Obras, V: 40, 55; 6: 33)  \nIn this connection, Ortega was in accord with Croce's notion that\n“we know that history is in all of us and that its sources are\nin our breasts”. According to this notion, the recordings of\n“chronicle's dead data” of the past fail to register the\nreality of history and human life, which is the “vital”,\nliving action of the present, and one with the past and the future.\nHistory characterizes what we are, instead of something that\nwe possess. Through history we learn who we are by examining\nwhat we have done. In view of this position that we are what\nwe have done, history shapes itself in and through ourselves\n(Obras, VII: 178–79). \nHence historical time carves the essence of individual configurations.\nFor Ortega, “historical reason” perceives and registers\nthe tangible facts of historical reality through the demonstrative\nprocess of how the present originated from the past in order to\nengender the future. By the term “historical reason”,\nOrtega intended to make a clearer distinction between the\n“cultural sciences” and the “natural sciences”\nto namely posit the notion that history has its\n“autochthonous” reason; history remains in a realm\nentirely its own. Ortega's notion of history's\n“autochthonous” reason establishes for history its\nautonomy from both the abstract concepts of philosophy and the logic\nof “physico-mathematical reason”. His invocation of\nhistory as humanity's appropriate science, and his overt emphasis on\nthe “original, autochthonous” basis of “historical\nreason”, point to his insistence on the systematic quality of\nhistory and on the “transcendent” character of physical\nand mathematical reason. History becomes autonomous in that history\nalone consists of the essence of human reality, and historical\nknowledge provides us with the essential understanding of this human\nreality. Every concept “claiming to represent human\nreality”, he explains, “every concept referring to human\nlife, specifically, is a function of historical time”\n(Obras, VI: 40–41). In conjunction with the\nhistoricization of the individual, historical reason became the medium\nthat circumscribed and eventually supplanted physical and mathematical\nreason as the unitary principle of ultimate reality: human life, and\nthereby “historical reason” was now viewed as possessing,\nat once, the principle of diversity and unity. Hence, history was\nrationalized and reason was historicized, as with the individual: \n…Man alienated from himself encounters himself as reality, as\nhistory. And, for the first time, he sees himself compelled to occupy\nhimself with his past, not from curiosity nor in order to find\nnormative examples, but because he has no other thing. Things\nare never done seriously but when, truly, they are absolutely\nnecessary. For this reason, the present hour is the time for history\nto re-establish itself as historical reason. \nUntil now history has been contrary to reason. In Greece the two terms\n“reason” and “history” were opposed. And until\nnow, in effect, hardly anyone has been concerned to search in history\nfor its rational substance…. Hence the expression\n“historical reason” must be understood in all the rigor of\nthe term. Not an extrahistorical reason which appears to fulfill\nitself in history but, literally, a substantive reason constituted\nby what has happened to man, the revelation of reality\ntranscending man's theories and which is himself, the self underlying\nhis theories (Obras, VI: 49–50). \nIn one of his essays on Hegel, Ortega remarked on the change in\nEuropean intellectual sensitivity that  \nthe “modern” spirit has experienced in the last\nyears…. The “modern” [spirit] does not believe as\nnaively in the final age any more. (Obras, II: 565–66)\n \nThis modern stance epitomized what Ortega had come to understand as\none of the distinctive characteristics of modernity: the consciousness\nof human life's increasing depreciation, and the subsequent\nreaffirmation of life through the expression of creative freedom.\nOrtega perceived the early twentieth century as a world emptied of\nmeaning and sought to elude the despair provoked by its\nmeaninglessness. To transform this sense of despair, he affirmed\n“our life, human life”, as the “radical\nreality”. Human life thus constitutes constancy and change or,\nas Ortega proclaimed, “historical reality”\n(Obras, VII: 99–100; 2: 540–41). Through the\ndiscussion of historical reality and historical reason, the ground\nupon which historical knowledge has been based for Ortega becomes\napparent. Speculative philosophies of history, the “owl of\nMinerva”, began its flight at dusk; for Ortega, and for certain\ntwentieth century philosophers of history, “historical\nreason” proclaims the dawn of human history. \nIndividual lives are historical. Where human life has a beginning and\nan end, in view of Ortega's reading of Hegel, history has neither a\nfirst beginning nor a final end. It can only be conceived of as the\nrealization of the potentialities of the individual in historical\ntime. In retracing the individual's struggle to control nature and in\nreviving the thoughts and conscious life of the past, historical study\noffers the contemporary generation the challenge of making its own\nvital decisions on the basis of critical knowledge of the full scope\nof former human experiences and achievements. History is understood\nhere in its dual meaning as a factual world of phenomena and as\ndiscipline concerned with only its relevance of life in the\npresent. \nStarting from the premise that consciousness, in the sense of\ncognitive awareness, always should be consciousness of something,\nOrtega and modern thinkers have perplexed themselves with questions of\nwhat consciousness is in itself and how it is related to the thing, or\nthe facts, which are its objects. It does not appear to be identical\nwith its objects, yet, neither does perception. Historical\nconsciousness constitutes a concern with the past as being relevant to\nour understanding and apprehending of the human condition. Its key\nattribute consists of our awareness of ourselves as\n“being-in-time”. It implies that the temporal ordering of\nevents refers to the very nature of human existence. Historical\nconsciousness thus enables the individual, a civilization and the\nphilosopher of history to expand their experiences beyond their actual\nhistoric time frame to absorb the results of events in which they had\nno part. The study of history thereby opens the horizon to\nparticipation in the completeness of human history. \nThis participation in human history has to be understood as being\ndirect and active. Where the physical scientist perceives phenomena\nwhich have a reality independent of the observer, history has the\ncharacter of being real in the consciousness of the historian. The\nword “history” means both history as actuality—the\nres gestae of Ortega and Collingwood—and written\nhistory; history as what has happened in the past. Clearly, any\nattempt to distinguish between historical reality and historical\naccounts of reality implies the interpreter knowing what constitutes\nhistorical reality. The past is present only insofar as it is relived\nby the historian through sympathy and understanding. The central\nproblems of historical epistemology and methodology revolve around the\nunderstanding that an objective knowledge of the past can be attained\nsolely through the subjective experiences of the investigator. Thus to\nunderstand an action, or past actions, implies comprehending it as an\nexpression or process of meaning conceptually connected to some\nunderlying pattern of thought or intention, rather than as a\ncompletely contingent relation. Moreover, such an underlying pattern\npresupposes a background structure of established rules or practices\nof the sort that may prove to be integral to human life and experience\nas we apprehend them. For to claim, as does Collingwood, that such an\naccount of historical understanding requires the re-enactment of past\nthinking merely directs attention to the method, admittedly familiar\namong historians, of imaginatively projecting oneself into another's\nposition for the purpose of arriving at an explanatory hypothesis.\nOrtega also claims that, \nman invents for himself a program of life, a static form of being,\nthat responds satisfactorily to the difficulties planned for him by\ncircumstance. He essays this figure of life, attempts to realize this\nimaginary character he has resolved to be. He embarks on this essay\nillusioned and creates, completely, the experience of it…. But\non experimenting with it, the limits of this vital program make\napparent its insufficiencies. It does not resolve all the\ndifficulties, and it creates new ones (Obras, VI: 41).  \nThe claim was to demonstrate that the explanations historians provide\nare similar in their structural analysis to those put forward in other\nareas of investigation in the social sciences; this demonstrates that\nan explanation of past historical actions, by reference to\nmotivational factors, is possible when presupposing the validity of\npertinent cognitive generalizations. Ortega, together with Croce,\nDilthey, Collingwood and others who associated with the tradition of\nhistoricism, expressed sympathy with those who claimed that the\ninterpretation of human actions raised difficulties for standard\nempiricist accounts and explanations of the human and social world.\nFor the most part, they were wholly committed to universal human\nobjectives and placed a very high value on the uniqueness of the\nindividual. They were concerned with the philosophical implications of\nhistorical knowledge and made attempts to develop systematically the\nproblem of relating presuppositions to the problem of historical\nknowledge. They sought to identify their specialty, philosophy and the\nphilosophy of history, with historical knowledge.\n“History”, Ortega averred,  \nis perfect continuity. Every idea of mine comes from another idea of\nmine or from the ideas of some other man… [Therefore]\nhistorical thinking proceeds with respect to human\nphenomena—philosophy, law, society, arts and letters, language,\nreligion—the same thing began with the natural sciences, as\nestablished in the works of Kepler and Galileo, when they proceeded to\nbring together empirically the simple facts of material phenomena.\n(Obras, VI: 167, 184)  \nOrtega's contribution to this area of study has been to emphasize what\nhe considered the epistemological implications of historical\nknowledge. In the company of such phenomenologists as Husserl,\nHeidegger and Scheler, Ortega was challenged to continually emphasize\nthe strict and accurate observation of the various elements of human\nexperience. Ortega was persuaded by the argument that isolated\nempirical facts, apart from any understanding of their interior\nmeaning, their inner connection to human life and the meaning of the\nsocial and historical process were limited, if not futile. In adopting\nthese orientations, philosophers, historians and philosophers of\nhistory may learn from philosophical and cultural anthropology that\nconstructive comparisons can be made between understanding what\nindividuals do and understanding what they say. Through this\nconnection the philosopher of history may reconstruct historical time\nas a form of human understanding and, if so inclined, as the process\nthrough which self-analysis may be attempted. As we saw, for Ortega,\nthe interpretation of human actions raises difficulties for standard\nempiricist accounts of explanation of the human and social world. The\nresults of Ortega's studies in existential phenomenology, historicism\nand the philosophy of history allured him to the approach of choice\nand knowledge of the individual and of humanity. This approach\nadvances the notion that, through history, the epistemological break\noccurs not with the past but with empirical accounts of the past. The\nphilosophical historian's approach and attitudes toward the past, when\nhoned successfully, can result in his or her ability to comprehend and\ncommunicate with the past on its own terms. The historical approach\nthus serves as a communicative link between the past and the present,\nand the philosopher, in making such communication possible, serves as\na mediator between the worlds of the past and present. The historical\nlines connecting the past and the present also connect temporal\nreality and the observer. To attain this end, Ortega eventually\ngrounded historical knowledge in a thorough knowledge of the\nindividual. “History”, he explained,  \nis the systematic science of that radical reality which is my\nlife…. There is no actio in distans. The past is not\nthere, at the date when it happened, but here, in me. The past is\nI—by which I understand, my life. (Obras, VI:\n40–41) \nThe historical act of reconstructing past human creations and\nprojecting oneself into the thoughts of others makes salient critical\nphilosophy of history's synthetic function of connecting temporal\nreality and mind through the process and consciousness of time.\nThrough this form of communication with the past and present, the\nphenomenological aspect of Ortega's thought thereby combines with his\nexistential and historicist perspectives. The synthetic function of\nthese perspectives becomes actualized in individual behavior, in\nsocial relations and in history. It is the fusion of these approaches\nthat mark Ortega's contribution to philosophy. “Very deep is the\nwell in the past”, Thomas Mann wrote at the beginning of his\nnovel, Joseph and His Brothers. In bringing human\nconnectedness and meaning to historical time and mind, Ortega's\ncritical philosophy of history has provided a synthesis that serves to\nprevent the deep well of the past from becoming bottomless.","contact.mail":"oholmes@wesleyan.edu","contact.domain":"wesleyan.edu"}]
