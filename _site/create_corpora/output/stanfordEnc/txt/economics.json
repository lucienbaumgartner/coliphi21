Although these\ninquiries overlap in many ways, it is useful to divide philosophy of\neconomics in this way into three subject matters which can be regarded\nrespectively as branches of action theory, ethics (or normative social\nand political philosophy), and philosophy of science. Economic\ntheories of rationality, welfare, and social choice defend substantive\nphilosophical theses often informed by relevant philosophical\nliterature and of evident interest to those interested in action\ntheory, philosophical psychology, and social and political philosophy.\nEconomics is of particular interest to those interested in\nepistemology and philosophy of science both because of its detailed\npeculiarities and because it possesses many of the overt features of\nthe natural sciences, while its object consists of social\nphenomena.\n\nBoth the definition and the precise domain of economics are subjects\nof controversy within philosophy of economics. At first glance, the\ndifficulties in defining economics may not appear serious. Economics\nis, after all, concerned with aspects of the production, exchange,\ndistribution, and consumption of commodities and services. But this\nclaim and the terms it contains are vague; and it is arguable that\neconomics is relevant to a great deal more. It helps to approach the\nquestion, “What is economics?” historically, before\nturning to comments on contemporary features of the discipline. \nPhilosophical reflection on economics is ancient, but the conception\nof the economy as a distinct object of study dates back only to the\n18th century. Aristotle addresses some problems that most would\nrecognize as pertaining to economics, mainly as problems concerning\nhow to manage a household. Scholastic philosophers addressed ethical\nquestions concerning economic behavior, and they condemned usury\n— that is, the taking of interest on money. With the increasing\nimportance of trade and of nation-states in the early modern period,\n‘mercantilist’ philosophers and pamphleteers were largely\nconcerned with the balance of trade and the regulation of the\ncurrency. There was an increasing recognition of the complexities of\nthe financial management of the state and of the possibility that the\nway that the state taxed and acted influenced the production of\nwealth. \nIn the early modern period, those who reflected on the sources of a\ncountry’s wealth recognized that the annual harvest, the\nquantities of goods manufactured, and the products of mines and\nfisheries depend on facts about nature, individual labor and\nenterprise, tools and what we would call “capital goods”,\nand state and social regulations. Trade also seemed advantageous, at\nleast if the terms were good enough. It took no conceptual leap to\nrecognize that manufacturing and farming could be improved and that\nsome taxes and tariffs might be less harmful to productive activities\nthan others. But to formulate the idea that there is such a thing as\n“the economy” with regularities that can be investigated\nrequires a bold further step. In order for there to be an object of\ninquiry, there must be regularities in production and exchange; and\nfor the inquiry to be non-trivial, these regularities must go beyond\nwhat is obvious to the producers, consumers, and exchangers\nthemselves. Only in the eighteenth century, most clearly illustrated\nby the work of Cantillon, the physiocrats,\n David Hume,\n and especially Adam Smith (see the entry on \n Smith’s moral and political philosophy),\n does one find the idea that there are laws to be discovered that\ngovern the complex set of interactions that produce and distribute\nconsumption goods and the resources and tools that produce them\n(Backhouse 2002). \nCrucial to the possibility of a social object of scientific inquiry is\nthe idea of tracing out the unintended consequences of the intentional\nactions of individuals. Thus, for example, Hume traces the rise in\nprices and the temporary increase in economic activity that follow an\nincrease in currency to the perceptions and actions of individuals who\nfirst spend the additional currency (1752). In spending their\nadditional gold imported from abroad, traders do not intend to\nincrease the price level. But that is what they do nevertheless. Adam\nSmith expands and perfects this insight and offers a systematic\nInquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.\nFrom his account of the demise of feudalism (1776, Book II, Ch. 4) to\nhis famous discussion of the invisible hand, Smith emphasizes\nunintended consequences. “[H]e intends only his own gain; and he\nis in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to\npromote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always\nthe worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his\nown interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more\neffectually than when he really intends to promote it” (1776,\nBook IV, Ch. 2). The existence of regularities, which are the\nunintended consequences of individual choices gives rise to an object\nof scientific investigation. \nOne can distinguish the domain of economics from the domain of other\nsocial scientific inquiries either by specifying some set of causal\nfactors or by specifying some range of phenomena. The phenomena with\nwhich economists are concerned are production, consumption,\ndistribution and exchange—particularly via markets. But since so\nmany different causal factors are relevant to these, including the\nlaws of thermodynamics, metallurgy, geography and social norms, even\nthe laws governing digestion, economics cannot be distinguished from\nother inquiries only by the phenomena it studies. Some\nreference to a set of central causal factors is needed. Thus, for\nexample,\n John Stuart Mill\n maintained that, “Political economy…[is concerned with]\nsuch of the phenomena of the social state as take place in consequence\nof the pursuit of wealth. It makes entire abstraction of every other\nhuman passion or motive, except those which may be regarded as\nperpetually antagonising principles to the desire of wealth, namely\naversion to labour, and desire of the present enjoyment of costly\nindulgences.” (1843, Book VI, Chapter 9, Section 3) In\nMill’s view, economics is mainly concerned with the consequences\nof individual pursuit of tangible wealth, though it takes some account\nof less significant motives such as aversion to labor. \nMill takes it for granted that individuals act rationally in their\npursuit of wealth and luxury and avoidance of labor, rather than in a\ndisjointed or erratic way, but he has no theory of consumption, or\nexplicit theory of rational economic choice, and his theory of\nresource allocation is rather thin. These gaps were gradually filled\nduring the so-called neoclassical or marginalist revolution, which\nlinked choice of some object of consumption (and its price) not to its\ntotal utility but to its marginal utility. For example, water is\nobviously extremely useful, but in much of the world it is plentiful\nenough that another glass more or less matters little to an agent. So\nwater is cheap. Early “neoclassical” economists such as\nWilliam Stanley Jevons held that agents make consumption choices so as\nto maximize their own happiness (1871). This implies that they\ndistribute their expenditures so that a dollar’s worth of water\nor porridge or upholstery makes the same contribution to their\nhappiness. The “marginal utility” of a dollar’s\nworth of each good is the same. \nIn the Twentieth Century, economists stripped this theory of its\nhedonistic clothing (Pareto 1909, Hicks and Allen 1934). Rather than\nsupposing that all consumption choices can be ranked by how much they\npromote an agent’s happiness, economists focused on the ranking\nitself. All that they suppose concerning evaluations is that agents\nare able consistently to rank the alternatives they face. This is\nequivalent to supposing first that rankings are complete — that\nis, for any two alternatives x and y that the agent\nconsiders, either the agent ranks x above y (prefers\nx to y), or the agent prefers y to\nx, or the agent is indifferent. Second, economists suppose\nthat agent’s rankings of alternatives (preferences) are\ntransitive. To say that an agent’s preferences are transitive is\nto claim that if the agent prefers x to y and\ny to z, then the agent prefers x to\nz, with similar claims concerning indifference and\ncombinations of indifference and preference. Though there are further\ntechnical conditions to extend the theory to infinite sets of\nalternatives and to capture further plausible rationality conditions\nconcerning gambles, economists generally subscribe to a view of\nrational agents as at least possessing complete and transitive\npreferences and as choosing among the feasible alternatives whichever\nthey most prefer. In the theory of revealed preference, economists\nhave attempted unsuccessfully to eliminate all reference to subjective\npreference or to define preference in terms of choices (Samuelson\n1947, Houtthaker 1950, Little 1957, Sen 1971, 1973, Hausman 2012,\nchapter 3). \nIn clarifying the view of rationality that characterizes economic\nagents, economists have for the most part continued to distinguish\neconomics from other social inquiries by the content of the motives or\npreferences with which it is concerned. So even though people may seek\nhappiness through asceticism, or they may rationally prefer to\nsacrifice all their worldly goods to a political cause, economists\nhave supposed that such preferences are rare and unimportant to\neconomics. Economists are concerned with the phenomena deriving from\nrationality coupled with a desire for wealth and for larger bundles of\ngoods and services. \nEconomists have flirted with a less substantive characterization of\nindividual motivation and with a more expansive view of the domain of\neconomics. In his influential monograph, An Essay on the Nature\nand Significance of Economic Science, Lionel Robbins defined\neconomics as “the science which studies human behavior as a\nrelationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative\nuses” (1932, p. 15). According to Robbins, economics is not\nconcerned with production, exchange, distribution, or consumption as\nsuch. It is instead concerned with an aspect of all human action.\nRobbins’ definition helps one to understand efforts to\napply economic concepts, models, and techniques to other subject\nmatters such as the analysis of voting behavior and legislation, even as\neconomics maintains its connection to a traditional domain. \nContemporary economics is diverse. There are many schools and many\nbranches. Even so-called “orthodox” or\n“mainstream” economics has many variants. Some mainstream\neconomics is highly theoretical, though most of it is applied and\nrelies on rudimentary theory. Theoretical and applied work can be\ndistinguished as microeconomics or macroeconomics. There is also a\nthird branch, econometrics which is devoted to the empirical\nestimation, elaboration, and to some extent testing of microeconomic\nand macroeconomic models (but see Summers 1991 and Hoover 1994). \nMicroeconomics focuses on relations among individuals (with firms and\nhouseholds frequently counting as honorary individuals and little said\nabout the idiosyncrasies of the demand of particular individuals).\nIndividuals have complete and transitive preferences that govern their\nchoices. Consumers prefer more commodities to fewer and have\n“diminishing marginal rates of substitution” — i. e.\nthey will pay less for units of a commodity when they already have\nlots of it than when they have little of it. Firms attempt to maximize\nprofits in the face of diminishing returns: holding fixed all the\ninputs into production except one, output increases when there is more\nof the remaining input, but at a diminishing rate. Economists idealize\nand suppose that in competitive markets, firms and individuals cannot\ninfluence prices, but economists are also interested in strategic\ninteractions, in which the rational choices of separate individuals\nare interdependent. Game theory, which is devoted to the study of\nstrategic interactions, is of growing importance in economics.\nEconomists model the outcome of the profit-maximizing activities of\nfirms and the attempts of consumers optimally to satisfy their\npreferences as an equilibrium in which there is no excess\ndemand on any market. What this means is that anyone who wants to buy\nanything at the going market price is able to do so. There is no\nexcess demand, and unless a good is free, there is no excess\nsupply. \nMacroeconomics grapples with the relations among economic aggregates,\nsuch as relations between the money supply and the rate of interest or\nthe rate of growth, focusing especially on problems concerning the\nbusiness cycle and the influence of monetary and fiscal policy on\neconomic outcomes. Many mainstream economists would like to unify\nmacroeconomics and microeconomics, but few economists are satisfied\nwith the attempts that have been made to do so, especially via so\ncalled “representative agents” (Kirman 1992, Hoover\n2001a). Macroeconomics is immediately relevant to economic policy and\nhence (and unsurprisingly) subject to much more heated (and\npolitically-charged) controversy than microeconomics or econometrics.\nSchools of macroeconomics include Keynesians (and\n“new-Keynesians”), monetarists, “new classical\neconomics” (rational expectations theory — Begg 1982,\nCarter and Maddock 1984, Hoover 1988, Minford and Peel 1983), and\n“real business cycle” theories (Kydland and Prescott 1991,\n1994; Sent 1998). \nBranches of mainstream economics are also devoted to specific\nquestions concerning growth, finance, employment, agriculture,\nhousing, natural resources, international trade, and so forth. Within\northodox economics, there are also many different approaches, such as\nagency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976, Fama 1980), the\nChicago school (Becker 1976), or public choice theory\n(Brennan and Buchanan 1985, Buchanan 1975). These address questions\nconcerning incentives within firms and families and the ways that\ninstitutions guide choices. \nAlthough mainstream economics is dominant and demands the most\nattention, there are many other schools. Austrian economists\naccept orthodox views of choices and constraints, but they emphasize\nuncertainty and question whether one should regard outcomes as\nequilibria, and they are skeptical about the value of mathematical\nmodeling (Buchanan and Vanberg 1989, Dolan 1976, Kirzner 1976, Mises\n1949, 1978, 1981, Rothbard 1957, Wiseman 1983, Boettke 2010, Holcombe\n2014, Nell 2014a, 2014b, 2017, Boettke and Coyne 2015, Hagedorn 2015,\nHorwitz 2015, Dekker 2016, Linsbichler 2017 ). \nTraditional institutionalist economists question the value of\nabstract general theorizing and emphasize evolutionary concepts\n(Dugger 1979, Wilber and Harrison 1978, Wisman and Rozansky 1991,\nHodgson 2000, 2013, 2016, Hodgson and Knudsen 2010, Delorme 2010,\nRichter 2015). They emphasize the importance of generalizations\nconcerning norms and behavior within particular institutions. Applied\nwork in institutional economics is sometimes very similar to applied\northodox economics. More recent work in economics, which is also\ncalled institutionalist, attempts to explain features of institutions\nby emphasizing the costs of transactions, the inevitable\nincompleteness of contracts, and the problems “principals”\nface in monitoring and directing their agents (Coase 1937; Williamson\n1985; Mäki et al. 1993, North 1990; Brousseau and\nGlachant 2008). \nMarxian and socialist economists traditionally articulated\nand developed Karl Marx’s economic theories, but recently many\nsocialist economists have revised traditional Marxian concepts and\nthemes with tools borrowed from orthodox economic theory (Morishima\n1973, Roemer 1981, 1982, Bowles 2012, Piketty 2014, Lebowitz 2015,\nAuerbach 2016, Beckert 2016, Jacobs and Mazzucato 2016). \nThere are also socio-economists, who are concerned with the\nnorms that govern choices (Etzioni 1988, 2018),\nbehavioral economists, who study the nitty-gritty\nof choice behavior (Winter 1962, Thaler 1994, Ben Ner and\nPutterman 1998, Kahneman and Tversky 2000, Camerer 2003, Camerer and\nLoewenstein 2003, Camerer et al. 2003, Loewenstein 2008,\nThaler and Sunstein 2008, Saint-Paul 2011, Oliver 2013),\npost-Keynesians, who look to Keynes’s work and especially\nhis emphasis on demand (Dow 1985, Kregel 1976, Harcourt and Kriesler\n2013 Rochon and Rossi 2017), evolutionary economists, who \nemphasize the importance of institutions (Witt\n2008, Hodgson and Knudsen 2010, Vromen 2009, Hodgson 2013, 2016,\nCarsten 2013, Dopfer and Potts 2014, Wilson and Kirman 2016),\nneo-Ricardians, who emphasize relations among economic\nclasses (Sraffa 1960, Pasinetti 1981, Roncaglia 1978),\nand even neuroeconomists, who study neurological concomitants\nof choice behavior (Camerer 2007, Camerer et\nal. 2005, Camerer et al. 2008, Glimcher et al.\n2008, Loewenstein et al. 2008, Rusticinni 2005, 2008,\nGlimcher 2010). Economics is not one homogeneous enterprise. \nAlthough the different branches and schools of economics raise a wide\nvariety of epistemological and ontological issues concerning\neconomics, six problems have been central to methodological reflection\n(in this philosophical sense) concerning economics: \nPolicy makers look to economics to guide policy, and it seems\ninevitable that even the most esoteric issues in theoretical economics\nmay bear on some people’s material interests. The extent to\nwhich economics bears on and may be influenced by normative concerns\nraises methodological questions about the relationships between a\npositive science concerning “facts” and a\nnormative inquiry into values and what ought to be. Most\neconomists and methodologists believe that there is a reasonably clear\ndistinction between facts and values, between what is and what ought\nto be, and they believe that most of economics should be regarded as a\npositive science that helps policy makers choose means to accomplish\ntheir ends, though it does not bear on the choice of ends itself. \nThis view is questionable for several reasons (Mongin 2006, Hausman,\nMcPherson, and Satz 2017). First, economists have to interpret and\narticulate the incomplete specifications of goals and constraints\nprovided by policy makers (Machlup 1969b). Second, economic\n“science” is a human activity, and like all human\nactivities, it is governed by values. Those values need not be the\nsame as the values that influence economic policy, but it is debatable\nwhether the values that govern the activity of economists can be\nsharply distinguished from the values that govern policy makers.\nThird, much of economics is built around a normative theory of\nrationality. One can question whether the values implicit in such\ntheories are sharply distinguishable from the values that govern\npolicies. For example, it may be difficult to hold a maximizing view\nof individual rationality, while at the same time insisting that\nsocial policy should resist maximizing growth, wealth, or welfare in\nthe name of freedom, rights, or equality. Fourth, people’s views\nof what is right and wrong are, as a matter of fact, influenced by\ntheir beliefs about how people in fact behave. There is evidence that\nstudying theories that depict individuals as self-interested leads\npeople to regard self-interested behavior more favorably and to become\nmore self-interested (Marwell and Ames 1981, Frank et al.\n1993). Finally, people’s judgments are clouded by their\ninterests. Since economic theories bear so centrally on people’s\ninterests, there are bound to be ideological biases at work in the\ndiscipline (Marx 1867, Preface). Positive and normative are especially\ninterlinked within economics, because economists are not all\nresearchers and teachers. In addition, economists work as commentators\nand as it were “hired guns” whose salaries depend on\narriving at the conclusions their employers want. The bitter polemics\nconcerning macroeconomic policy responses to the great recession\nbeginning in 2008 testify to the influence of ideology. \nOrthodox theoretical microeconomics is as much a theory of rational\nchoices as it a theory that explains and predicts economic outcomes.\nSince virtually all economic theories that discuss individual choices\ntake individuals as acting for reasons, and thus in some way rational,\nquestions about the role that views of rationality and reasons should\nplay in economics are of general importance. Economists are typically\nconcerned with the aggregate results of individual choices rather than\nwith the actions of particular individuals, but their theories in fact\noffer both causal explanations for why individuals choose as they do\nand accounts of the reasons for their choices. See also the\nentries on\n methodological individualism and\n reasons for action: justification, motivation, explanation. \nExplanations in terms of reasons have several features that\ndistinguish them from explanations in terms of causes. Reasons purport to\njustify the actions they explain, and indeed so called\n“external reasons” (Williams 1981) only justify action,\nwithout purporting to explain it. Reasons can be evaluated, and they\nare responsive to criticism. Reasons, unlike causes, must be\nintelligible to those for whom they are reasons. On grounds such as\nthese, many philosophers have questioned whether explanations of human\naction can be causal explanations (von Wright 1971, Winch 1958). Yet\nmerely giving a reason — even an extremely good reason —\nfails to explain an agent’s action, if the reason was not in\nfact “effective.” Someone might, for example, start\nattending church regularly and give as his reason a concern with\nsalvation. But others might suspect that this agent is deceiving\nhimself and that the minister’s attractive daughter is in fact\nresponsible for his renewed interest in religion. Donald Davidson\n(1963) argued that what distinguishes the reasons that explain an\naction from the reasons that fail to explain it is that the former are\nalso causes of the action. Although the account of rationality within\neconomics differs in some ways from the\n folk psychology\n people tacitly invoke in everyday explanations of actions, many of\nthe same questions carry over (Rosenberg 1976, ch. 5; 1980, Hausman\n2012). \nAn additional difference between explanations in terms of reasons and\nexplanations in terms of causes, which some economists have\nemphasized, is that the beliefs and preferences that explain actions\nmay depend on mistakes and ignorance (Knight 1935). As a first\napproximation, economists can abstract from such difficulties caused\nby the\n intentionality\n of belief and desire. They thus often assume that people have perfect\ninformation about all the relevant facts. In that way theorists need\nnot worry about what people’s beliefs are. (If people have\nperfect information, then they believe and expect whatever the facts\nare.) But once one goes beyond this first approximation, difficulties\narise which have no parallel in the natural sciences. Choice depends\non how things look “from the inside”, which may be very\ndifferent from the actual state of affairs. Consider for example the\nstock market. The “true” value of a stock depends on the\nfuture profits of the company, which are of course uncertain. In 2006\nhouse prices in the U.S. were extremely inflated. But whether they\nwere “too high” depended at least in the short run, on\nwhat people believe. They were excellent investments if one could sell\nthem to others who would be willing to pay even more for them.\nEconomists disagree about how significant this subjectivity is.\nMembers of the Austrian school argue that these differences are of\ngreat importance and sharply distinguish theorizing about economics\nfrom theorizing about any of the natural sciences (Buchanan and\nVanberg 1989, von Mises 1981). \nOf all the social sciences, economics most closely resembles the\nnatural sciences. Economic theories have been axiomatized, and\narticles and books of economics are full of theorems. Of all the\nsocial sciences, only economics boasts an ersatz Nobel Prize.\nEconomics is thus a test case for those concerned with the extent of\nthe similarities between the natural and social sciences. Those who\nhave wondered whether social sciences must differ fundamentally from\nthe natural sciences seem to have been concerned mainly with three\nquestions: \n(i) Are there fundamental differences between the structure or\nconcepts of theories and\n explanations\n in the natural and social sciences? Some of these issues were already\nmentioned in the discussion above of reasons versus causes. \n(ii) Are there fundamental differences in goals? Philosophers and\neconomists have argued that in addition to or instead of the\npredictive and explanatory goals of the natural sciences, the social\nsciences should aim at providing us with understanding. Weber\nand others have argued that the social sciences should provide us with\nan understanding “from the inside”, that we should be able\nto empathize with the reactions of the agents and to find what happens\n“understandable” (Weber 1904, Knight 1935, Machlup 1969a).\nThis (and the closely related recognition that explanations cite\nreasons rather than just causes) seems to introduce an element of\nsubjectivity into the social sciences that is not found in the natural\nsciences. \n(iii) Owing to the importance of human choices (or perhaps free will),\nare social phenomena too irregular to be captured within a framework\nof laws and theories? Given human free will, perhaps human behavior is\nintrinsically unpredictable and not subject to any laws. But there\nare, in fact, many regularities in human action, and given the\nenormous causal complexity characterizing some natural systems, the\nnatural sciences must cope with many irregularities, too. \nEconomics raises questions concerning the legitimacy of severe\nabstraction and idealization. For example, mainstream economic models\noften stipulate that everyone is perfectly rational and has perfect\ninformation or that commodities are infinitely divisible. Such claims\nare exaggerations, and they are clearly false. Other schools of\neconomics may not employ idealizations that are this extreme, but\nthere is no way to do economics if one is not willing to simplify\ndrastically and abstract from many complications. How much\nsimplification, idealization, abstraction or “isolation”\n(Mäki 2006) is legitimate? \nIn addition, because economists attempt to study economic phenomena as\nconstituting a separate domain, influenced only by a small number of\ncausal factors, the claims of economics are true only ceteris\nparibus — that is, they are true only if there are no\ninterferences or disturbing causes. What are ceteris paribus\nclauses, and when if ever are they legitimate in science? Questions\nconcerning ceteris paribus clauses are closely related to\nquestions concerning simplifications and idealizations, since one way\nto simplify is to suppose that the various disturbing causes or\ninterferences are inactive and to explore the consequences of some\nsmall number of causal factors. These issues and the related question\nof how well supported economics is by the evidence have been\nthe central questions in economic methodology. They will be\ndiscussed further below mainly in\n Section 3. \nMany important generalizations in economics are causal claims. For\nexample, the law of demand asserts that a price increase will\n(ceteris paribus) diminish the quantity demanded. (It does\nnot merely assert an inverse relationship between price and demand.\nWhen demand increases for some other reason, such as a change in\ntastes, price increases.) Econometricians have also been\ndeeply concerned with the possibilities of determining causal\nrelations from statistical evidence and with the relevance of causal\nrelations to the possibility of consistent estimation of parameter\nvalues. Since concerns about the consequences of alternative policies\nare so central to economics, causal inquiry is unavoidable. \nBefore the 1930s, economists were generally willing to use causal\nlanguage explicitly and literally, despite some concerns that there\nmight be a conflict between causal analysis of economic changes and\n“comparative statics” treatments of equilibrium states.\nSome economists were also worried that thinking in terms of causes was\nnot compatible with recognizing the multiplicity and mutuality of\ndetermination in economic equilibrium. In the anti-metaphysical\nintellectual environment of the 1930s and 1940s (of which logical\npositivism was at least symptomatic), any mention of causation became\nsuspicious, and economists commonly pretended to avoid causal\nconcepts. The consequence was that they ceased to reflect carefully on\nthe causal concepts that they continued implicitly to invoke (Hausman\n1983, 1990, Helm 1984, Runde 1998). For example, rather than\nformulating the law of demand in terms of the causal consequences of\nprice changes for quantity demanded, economists tried to confine\nthemselves to discussing the mathematical function relating price and\nquantity demanded. There were important exceptions (Haavelmo 1944,\nSimon 1953, Wold 1954), and during the past generation, this state of\naffairs has changed dramatically. \nFor example, in his Causality in Macroeconomics (2001b) Kevin\nHoover develops feasible methods for investigating large scale causal\nquestions, such as whether changes in the money supply (M)\ncause changes in the rate of inflation P or accommodate\nchanges in P that are otherwise caused. If changes in\nM cause changes in P, then the conditional\ndistribution of P on M should remain stable with\nexogenous changes in M, but should change with exogenous\nchanges in P. Hoover argues that historical investigation,\nbacked by statistical inquiry, can justify the conclusion that some\nparticular changes in M or P have been exogenous.\nOne can then determine the causal direction by examining the stability\nof the conditional distributions. Econometricians have made vital\ncontributions to the contemporary revival of philosophical interest in\nthe notion of causation. In addition to Hoover’s work, see for\nexample Geweke (1982), Granger (1969, 1980), Cartwright (1989), Sims\n(1977), Zellner and Aigner (1988), Pearl (2000), Spirtes, Glymour and\nScheines (2001). \nOne relatively secure way to determine causal relations is via\nrandomized controlled experiments. If the experimenters sort subjects\nrandomly into experimental and control groups and vary just one\nfactor, then, unless by bad luck the two groups differ in some unknown\nway, changes in the outcomes given the common features of the control\nand treatment groups should be due to the difference in the one\nfactor. Indeed, in the case of quantitative variables, one can\ncalculate average causal effects (Deaton 2010). This makes randomized\ncontrolled trials very attractive, though no panacea, since the\ntreatment and control groups may not be representative of the\npopulation in which policy-makers hope to apply the causal\nconclusions, and the causal consequences of the intervention might\ndiffer across different subgroups within the control and treatment\ngroups (Worrall 2007, Cartwright and Hardie 2013). \nFor both practical and ethical reasons, it is often hard to experiment\nin economics (though, as discussed in section 4.5, far from\nimpossible). But with some ingenuity and with far greater enthusiasm\nfor experimentation than had been the case previously, economists are\nexperimenting much more frequently both in the laboratory and in the\nfield. In addition, as a substitute for experimentation, or as a way\nof stretching the limits on experimentation, economists in recent\nyears have become very enthusiastic about so-called\n“instrumental variable” techniques. For example, merely\nexamining the correlation between economic growth and development aid,\neven controlling for other factors known to influence economic growth\nis unlikely to reveal the causal influence of aid on growth, because\naid may reciprocally depend on growth and well as many factors that\nare hard to measure that also influence growth. These problems can be\nto some extent circumvented if economists can find an\n“instrumental” variable x upon which aid depends\nthat influences growth (if at all) only by its influence on aid and\nwhich is probabilistically independent of all other determinants of\ngrowth. In that case, one can use the effect of x on growth\nto estimate the effect of aid on growth. Instrumental variable\ntechniques, policy experimentation, and reliance on “natural\nexperiments” have become widespread, though they bring with them\nnew problems extrapolating experimental results to the target\npopulation (Deaton 2010; Cartwright and Hardie 2013). \nIn the wake of the work of\n Kuhn\n (1970) and Lakatos (1970), philosophers are much more aware of and\ninterested in the larger theoretical structures that unify and guide\nresearch within particular research traditions. Since many theoretical\nprojects or approaches in economics are systematically unified, they\npose questions about what guides research, and many economists have\napplied the work of Kuhn or Lakatos in the attempt to shed light on\nthe overall structure of economics (Baumberg 1977, Blaug 1976, de\nMarchi and Blaug 1991, Bronfenbrenner 1971, Coats 1969, Dillard 1978,\nHands 1985b, Hausman 1992, ch. 6, Hutchison 1978, Latsis 1976,\nJalladeau 1978, Kunin and Weaver 1971, Stanfield 1974, Weintraub 1985,\nWorland 1972). Whether these applications have been successful is\ncontroversial, but the comparison of the structure of economics to\nKuhn’s and Lakatos’ schema served to highlight distinctive\nfeatures of economics and may have contributed to some of the changes\nthat economics has undergone. For example, asking what the\n“positive heuristic” of mainstream economics consists in\npermits one to see that mainstream theoretical models typically\nattempted to demonstrate that an economic equilibrium will obtain, and\nthus that mainstream models were unified in more than just their\ncommon assumptions. Since the success of research projects in\neconomics is controversial, understanding their global structure and\nstrategy helped to clarify their drawbacks as well as their\nadvantages. \nAs mentioned in the previous section, the most important\nmethodological issue concerning economics involves the very\nconsiderable simplification, idealization, and abstraction that\ncharacterizes economic theory and the consequent doubts these features\nof economics raise concerning whether economics is well supported.\nClaims such as, “Agents prefer larger commodity bundles to\nsmaller commodity bundles,” raise serious questions, because if\nthey are interpreted as universal generalizations, they are false; and\nphilosophy of science has traditionally supposed that science is\ndevoted to the discovery of genuine laws—that is, true universal\ngeneralizations. Even though it is false that everyone always prefers\nlarger commodity bundles to smaller, the generalization seems\ninformative and useful. Can a science rest on false generalizations?\nIf these claims are not universal generalizations, then what is their\nlogical form? And how can claims that appear in this way to be false\nor approximate be tested and confirmed or disconfirmed? These problems\nhave bedeviled economists and economic methodologists from the first\nmethodological reflections to the present day. \nThe first extended reflections on economic methodology appear in the\nwork of Nassau Senior (1836) and John Stuart Mill (1836). Their essays\nmust be understood against the background of both the economic theory\nand the philosophy of science of their times. Like Smith’s\neconomics (to which it owed a great deal) and modern economics, the\n“classical” economics of the middle decades of the 19th\ncentury traced economic regularities to the choices of individuals\nfacing social and natural constraints. But, as compared to Smith, more\nreliance was placed on severely simplified models. David\nRicardo’s Principles of Political Economy (1817), draws\na portrait in which wages above the subsistence level lead to\nincreases in the population, which in turn require more intensive\nagriculture or cultivation of inferior land. The extension of\ncultivation leads to lower profits and higher rents; and the whole\ntale of economic development leads to a gloomy stationary state in\nwhich profits are too low to command any net investment, wages slide\nback to subsistence levels, and only the landlords are affluent. \nFortunately for the world, but unfortunately for economic theorists of\nthe mid 19th century, the data consistently contradicted the trends\nthe theory predicted (de Marchi 1970). Yet the theory continued to\nhold sway for more than half a century, and the consistently\nunfavorable data were explained away as due to various\n“disturbing causes.” It is consequently not surprising\nthat Senior’s and Mill’s accounts of the method of\neconomics emphasize the relative autonomy of theory. \nMill distinguishes between two main kinds of inductive methods. The\nmethod a posteriori is a method of direct experience. In his\nview, it is only suitable for phenomena in which few causal factors\nare operating or in which experimental controls are possible.\nMill’s famous methods of induction provide an articulation of\nthe method a posteriori. In his method of difference, for\nexample, one holds fixed every causal factor except one and checks to\nsee whether the effect ceases to obtain when that one factor is\nremoved. The goal is to identify exceptionless causal laws. \nMill maintains that direct inductive methods cannot be used to study\nphenomena in which many causal factors are in play. If, for example,\none attempts to investigate whether tariffs enhance or impede\nprosperity by comparing the prosperity of nations with high tariffs\nand nations without high tariffs, the results will be uninformative,\nbecause prosperity depends on so many other causal factors. So, Mill\nargues, one needs instead to employ the method a priori.\nDespite its name, this too is an inductive method. However, unlike the\nmethod a posteriori, the method a priori is an\nindirect inductive method. Scientists first determine the\nlaws governing individual causal factors in domains in which\nMill’s methods of induction are applicable. Having then\ndetermined the laws of the individual causes, they investigate their\ncombined consequences deductively. Finally, there is a role for\n“verification” of the combined consequences, but owing to\nthe causal complications, this testing has comparatively little\nweight. The testing of the conclusions serves only as a check on the\nscientist’s deductions and as an indicator of whether there are\nsignificant disturbing causes that scientists have not yet accounted\nfor. \nMill gives the example of the science of the tides. Physicists\ndetermined the law of gravitation by studying planetary motion, in\nwhich gravity is the only significant causal factor. Then physicists\ndevelop the theory of tides deductively from that law and information\nconcerning the positions and motions of the moon and sun. The\nimplications of the theory will be inexact and sometimes badly\nmistaken, because many subsidiary causal factors influence tides.\nTesting theories of tides can uncover mistakes in the deductions\nphysicists made, and it may uncover evidence concerning the role of the\nsubsidiary factors. But because of the causal complexity, such testing\ndoes little to confirm or disconfirm the law of gravitation, which has\nalready been established. Although Mill does not often use the\nlanguage of “ceteris paribus”, his view that the\nprinciples or “laws” of economics hold in the absence of\n“interferences” or “disturbing causes”\nprovides an account of how the principles of economics can be true\nceteris paribus (Hausman 1992, ch. 8, 12). \nBecause economic theory includes only the most important causes and\nnecessarily ignores minor causes, its claims, like claims concerning\ntides, are inexact. Its predictions will be imprecise, and sometimes\nfar off. Mill maintains that it is nevertheless possible to develop\nand confirm economic theory by studying in simpler domains the laws\ngoverning the major causal factors and then deducing their\nconsequences in more complicated circumstances. For example, the\nstatistical data are ambiguous concerning the relationship between\nminimum wages and unemployment of unskilled workers; and since the\nminimum wage has never been extremely high, there are no data about\nwhat unemployment would be in those circumstances. On the other hand,\neveryday experience teaches economists that firms can choose among\nmore or less labor-intensive processes and that a high minimum wage\nwill make more labor-intensive processes more expensive. On the\nassumption that firms try to keep their costs down, economists have\ngood (though not conclusive) reason to believe that a high minimum\nwage will increase unemployment. \nIn defending a view of economics as in this way inexact and employing\nthe method a priori, Mill thought he was able to reconcile his\nempiricism and his commitment to Ricardo’s economics. Although\nMill’s views on economic methodology were challenged later in\nthe nineteenth century by economists who believed that theory was too\nremote from the contingencies of policy and history (Roscher 1874,\nSchmoller 1888, 1898), Mill’s methodological views dominated the\nmainstream of economic theory for a century (for example, Cairnes\n1875). Mill’s vision survived the so-called neoclassical\nrevolution in economics beginning in the 1870s and is clearly\ndiscernible in the most important methodological treatises concerning\nneoclassical economics, such as John Neville Keynes’ The\nScope and Method of Political Economy (1891) or Lionel\nRobbins’ An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic\nScience (1932). Hausman (1992) argues that current methodological\npractice closely resembles Mill’s methodology, despite the fact\nthat few economists explicitly defend it. \nAlthough this way of interpreting Mill and the methodology of\neconomics is coherent and conforms to an old-fashioned empiricist\nphilosophy of science that finds the nomological force of\ngeneralizations in their universality, it is not faithful to the way\nin which economists see their theories. Rather than regarding\ngeneralizations such as acquisitiveness as universal laws carrying\nimplicit ceteris paribus qualifications in their antecedents,\neconomists are much more likely to regard these generalizations as\n“tendencies” that continue to operate even when defeated\nby interferences and that need to be studied separately (Woodward\n2003). Even Mill speaks of tendencies, though without reconciling his\ntalk of tendencies with his empiricism. If one sets aside metaphysical\nqualms about tendencies and counterfactuals, the most natural way to\nsee economic theorizing is as the counterfactual investigation of\ncombinations of tendencies. As the discussion below of models\nconfirms, such views are congenial to economists and puzzling to\nphilosophers with empiricist scruples. \nConceptualizing of economic inquiry as the study of models and\ntendencies, seems to shift the terms of the problems posed by\ninexactness rather than to offer a solution. Julian Reiss has, in\neffect, rediscovered the problem in an influential essay, “The\nExplanation Paradox.” (2013), where he argues that the following\nthree propositions are inconsistent: (1) Economic models are false.\n(2) Economic models are explanatory. (3) Explanation requires\ntruth.The formulation is a bit obscure, since models are not single\nsentences or propositions that can be true or false, but it should be\nclear that Reiss’s putative paradox is a reformulation of the\nproblem posed by the inexactness of economic theories or models. \nAlthough some contemporary philosophers have argued that Mill’s\nmethod a priori is largely defensible (Bhaskar 1975,\nCartwright 1989, and Hausman 1992), by the middle of the Twentieth\nCentury Mill’s views appeared to many economists out of step\nwith their understanding of contemporary philosophy of science.\nWithout studying Mill’s text carefully, it was easy for\neconomists to misunderstand his terminology and to regard his method\na priori as opposed to empiricism. Others took seriously\nMill’s view that the basic principles of economics should be\nempirically established and found evidence to cast doubt on some of\nthe basic principles, particularly the view that firms attempt to\nmaximize profits (Hall and Hitch 1938, Lester 1946, 1947).\nMethodologists who were well-informed about contemporary developments\nin philosophy of science, such as Terence Hutchison (1938), denounced\n“pure theory” in economics as unscientific. \nPhilosophically reflective economists proposed several ways to replace\nthe old-fashioned Millian view with a more up-to-date methodology that\nwould continue to justify much of current practice (see particularly\nMachlup 1955, 1960 and Koopmans 1957). By far the most influential of\nthese efforts was Milton Friedman’s 1953 essay, “The\nMethodology of Positive Economics.” This essay has had an\nenormous influence, far more than any other work on methodology. \nFriedman begins his essay by distinguishing in a conventional way\nbetween positive and normative economics and conjecturing that policy\ndisputes are typically really disputes about the consequences of\nalternatives and can thus be resolved by progress in positive\neconomics. Turning to positive economics, Friedman asserts (without\nargument) that correct prediction concerning phenomena not yet\nobserved is the ultimate goal of all positive sciences. He\nholds a practical view of science and finds the value of science in\npredictions that will guide policy. \nSince it is difficult and often impossible to carry out experiments\nand since the uncontrolled phenomena economists observe are difficult\nto interpret (owing to the same causal complexity that bothered Mill),\nit is hard to judge whether a particular theory is a good basis for\npredictions or not. Tendencies are not universal laws. A claim such as\n“firms attempt to maximize profits” will be\n“unrealistic” in the sense that it is not a true universal\ngeneralization. Although not in these terms, Friedman objects to\ncriticisms of tendencies that in effect complain that they are merely\ntendencies, rather than universal laws. If his criticism stopped\nthere, it would be sensible, although it would avoid the problems of\nunderstanding and appraising claims about tendencies. \nBut Friedman draws a much more radical conclusion. In his terminology,\nthe mistake economists make who criticize claims such as “firms\nattempt to maximize profits” lies in the attempt to test\ntheories by the “realism” of their\n“assumptions” rather than by the accuracy of their\npredictions. He maintains that the realism of a theory’s\nassumptions is irrelevant to its predictive value. It does not matter\nwhether the assumption that firms maximize profits is realistic.\nTheories should be appraised exclusively in terms of the accuracy of\ntheir predictions. What matters is exclusively whether the theory of\nthe firm makes correct and significant predictions. \nAs critics have pointed out (and almost all commentators have been\ncritical), Friedman refers to several different things as\n“assumptions” of a theory and means several different\nthings by speaking of assumptions as “unrealistic”\n(Brunner 1969). Since Friedman aims his criticism to those who\ninvestigate empirically whether firms in fact attempt to maximize\nprofits, he must take “assumptions” to include central\neconomic generalizations, such as “Firms attempt to maximize\nprofits,” and by “unrealistic,” he must mean, among\nother things, “false.” In arguing that it is a mistake to\nappraise theories in terms of the realism of assumptions, Friedman is\narguing at least that it is a mistake to appraise theories by\ninvestigating whether their central generalizations are true or\nfalse. \nIt would seem that this interpretation would render Friedman’s\nviews inconsistent, because in testing whether firms attempt to\nmaximize profits, one is checking whether predictions of theory\nconcerning the behavior of firms are true or false. An\n“assumption” such as “firms maximize profits”\nis itself a prediction. But there is a further wrinkle. Friedman is\nnot concerned with every prediction of economic theories. In\nFriedman’s view, “theory is to be judged by its predictive\npower exclusively for the class of phenomena which it is intended\nto explain” (1953, p. 8 [italics added]). Economists are\ninterested in only some of the implications of economic theories.\nOther predictions, such as those concerning the results of surveys of\nmanagers, are irrelevant to policy. What matters is whether economic\ntheories are successful at predicting the phenomena that economists\nare interested in. In other words, Friedman believes that economic\ntheories should be appraised in terms of their predictions concerning\nprices and quantities exchanged on markets. In his view, what matters\nis “narrow predictive success” (Hausman 2008a), not\noverall predictive adequacy. \nSo Friedman permits economists to ignore the disquieting findings of\nsurveys, or the fact that people do not always prefer larger bundles\nof commodities to smaller bundles of commodities. Nor do economists\nneed to be concerned about whether there is a tendency to prefer more\ncommodities to fewer. They need not be troubled that some of their\nmodels suppose extravagantly that all agents know the prices of all\npresent and future commodities in all markets. All that matters is\nwhether the predictions concerning market phenomena turn out to be\ncorrect. And since anomalous market outcomes could be due to any\nnumber of uncontrolled causal factors, while experiments are difficult\nto carry out, it turns out that economists need not worry about ever\nencountering evidence that would strongly disconfirm fundamental\ntheory. Detailed models may be confirmed or disconfirmed, but\nfundamental theory is safe. In this way one can understand how\nFriedman’s methodology, which appears to justify the eclectic\nand pragmatic view that economists should use any model that appears\nto “work” regardless of how absurd or unreasonable its\nassumptions might appear, has been deployed in service of a rigid\ntheoretical orthodoxy. For other discussions of Friedman’s\nessay, see Bear and Orr 1969, Boland 1979, Hammond 1992, Hirsch and de\nMarchi 1990, Mäki 1990a, Melitz 1963, Rotwein 1959, and Samuelson\n1963. \nOver the last two decades there has been a surge of experimentation in\neconomics, and Friedman’s methodological views probably do not\ncommand the same near unanimity that they used to. But they are still\nenormously influential, and they still serve as a way of avoiding\nawkward questions concerning simplifications, idealizations, and\nabstraction in economics rather than responding to them. \nA century ago economists talked of their work in terms of\n“principles,” “laws,”, and\n“theories.” That language has not disappeared altogether:\neconomists still talk of “game theory”, “consumer\nchoice theory”, or the “law of demand”. But nowadays\nthe standard intellectual tool or form in economics is a\n“model.” Econometricians speak of models and structures.\nEconomists are more comfortable describing the axioms concerning\nrational choice as constituting a model of rational choice than as\ndelineating a theory of rational choice. Many of the most\ndistinguished commentators on models regard them as fictional worlds,\nwhose study informs our understanding of actual phenomena (Frigg,\n2010). “Creating models is ‘world-making.’”\n(Morgan 2012, pp. 95, 405). In their view, economists are able to\ninvestigate how causal factors would operate in the absence of\ninterferences by constructing models —that is fictional\neconomies—in which the interferences are absent. Uskali\nMäki maintains that “Models are experiments. Experiments\nare models.” (2005). Dani Rodrik (2015) argues that economics\nconsists of a collection of models, and that doing economics consists in\nselecting or customizing a model from this collection. Is the ubiquity\nof talk of models just a change in terminological fashion, or does the\nconcern with models (which is by no means unique to economics) signal\na methodological shift? What are models? These questions have been\ndiscussed by Cartwright 1989, 1999, Godfrey Smith 2006,\nGrüne-Yanoff 2009, Hausman 1992, 2015a, Kuorikoski and Lehtinen\n2009, Mäki, ed. 1991, Mäki 2005, 2009a, 2009b, Morgan 2001,\n2004, 2012, Morgan and Morrison 1999, Rappaport 1998, Sugden 2000,\n2009, Weisberg 2007, and Lehtinen, Kuorikoski and Ylikoski 2012. \nThe view of models to which economists are most attracted is\nphilosophically problematic, because it is apparently committed to the\nexistence of fictional entities whose properties and causal\npropensities economists can investigate. In experiments, whether\ncarried out in a laboratory or in the field, experimenters interact\ncausally with flesh and blood experimental subjects, and the outcome\nmay contradict the economist’s predictions. In investigating a\nmodel, in contrast, the economist “interacts” with\nfictional entities, which are arguably nothing other than his or her\nown thoughts, and the logical implications of the axioms that define\nthe model are never disappointed. This is not to say that the logical\ninvestigation of models never results in surprises. Humans are not\nlogically omniscient, and discovering the implications of a set of\naxioms may be an arduous task. But it is a different task than\ncarrying out an experiment in the laboratory or the field, and\nontology of the “worlds” that economists allegedly\n“create” and then study is deeply puzzling. Although less\nfaithful to economic practice, it is far more intelligible\nphilosophically to regard models as predicates or as definitions of\npredicates (Hausman 1992). For example, when economists write down\na model of a firm with a single output and just two inputs,\nthey are defining a concept that they can use to describe\nactual firms. \nThe past half century has witnessed the emergence of a large\nliterature devoted to economic methodology. That literature explores\nmany methodological approaches and applies its conclusions to many\nschools and branches of economics. Much of the literature has focused\non the fundamental theory of mainstream economics — the theory\nof the equilibria resulting from constrained rational individual\nchoice — but the tremendous importance of macroeconomics in\ndetermining the proper responses to the great recession beginning in\n2008, coupled with the rapidly increasing role of empirical and\nexperimental inquiries in the day-to-day work of economists have seen\nechoes in methodological inquiries (Backhouse 2010). Since 1985, there\nhas been a journal Economics and Philosophy devoted\nspecifically to philosophy of economics, and since 1994 there has also\nbeen a Journal of Economic Methodology. This section will\nsample some of the methodological approaches of the past two\ndecades. \n\n Karl Popper’s\n philosophy of science has been influential among economists, as among\nother scientists. Popper defends what he calls a falsificationist\nmethodology (1968, 1969). Scientists should formulate theories that\nare “logically falsifiable” — that is, inconsistent\nwith some possible observation reports. “All crows are\nblack” is logically falsifiable; it is inconsistent with (and\nwould be falsified by) an observation report of a red crow.\n(Probabilistic claims are obviously not in this sense falsifiable.)\nPopper insists on falsifiability on the grounds that unfalsifiable\nclaims that rule out no observations are uninformative. They provide\nno guidance concerning what to expect, and there is nothing to be\nlearned from testing them. Second, Popper maintains that scientists\nshould subject theories to harsh test and should be willing to reject\nthem when they fail the tests. Third, scientists should regard\ntheories as at best interesting conjectures. Passing a test does not\nconfirm a theory or provide scientists with reason to believe it. It\nonly justifies on the one hand continuing to employ the hypothesis\n(since it has not yet been falsified) and, on the other hand, devoting\nincreased efforts to attempting to falsify it (since it has thus far\nsurvived testing). Popper has defended what he calls\n“situational logic” (which is basically rational choice\ntheory) as the correct method for the social sciences (1967, 1976).\nThere appear to be serious tensions between Popper’s\nfalsificationism and his defense of situational logic, and his\ndiscussion of situational logic has not been as influential as his\nfalsificationism. For discussion of how situational logic applies to\neconomics, see Hands (1985a). \nGiven Popper’s falsificationism, there seems little hope of\nunderstanding how extreme simplifications can be legitimate or how\ncurrent economic practice could be scientifically reputable. Economic\ntheories and models are almost all unfalsifiable, and if they were,\nthe widespread acceptance of Friedman’s methodological views\nwould insure that they are not subjected to serious test. When models\napparently fail tests, they are rarely repudiated. Economists conclude\ninstead merely that they chose the wrong model for the task, or that\nthere were disturbing causes. Economic models, which have not been\nwell tested, are often taken to be well-established guides to policy,\nrather than merely conjectures. Critics of neoclassical economics have\nmade these criticisms (Eichner 1983), but most of those who have\nespoused Popper’s philosophy of science have not repudiated\nmainstream economics and have not been harshly critical of its\npractitioners. \nMark Blaug (1992) and Terence Hutchison (1938, 1977, 1978, 2000), who\nare the most prominent Popperian methodologists, criticize particular\nfeatures of economics, and they both call for more testing and a more\ncritical attitude. For example, Blaug praises Gary Becker (1976) for\nhis refusal to explain differences in choices by differences in\npreferences, but criticizes him for failing to go on and test his\ntheories severely (1980a, chapter 14). However, both Blaug and\nHutchison understate the radicalism of Popper’s views and take\nhis message to be little more than that scientists should be critical\nand concerned to test their theories. \nBlaug’s and Hutchison’s criticisms have sometimes been\nchallenged on the grounds that economic theories cannot be\ntested, because of their ceteris paribus clauses and the many\nsubsidiary assumptions required to derive testable implications\n(Caldwell 1984). But this response ignores Popper’s insistence\nthat testing requires methodological decisions not to attribute\nfailures of predictions to mistakes in subsidiary assumptions or to\n“interferences.” For views of Popper’s philosophy\nand its applicability to economics, see de Marchi (1988), Caldwell\n(1991), Boland (1982, 1989, 1992, 1997), and Boylan and O’Gorman\n(2007), Backhouse (2009), and Thomas (2017). \nApplying Popper’s views on falsification literally would be\ndestructive. Not only neoclassical economics, but all significant\neconomic theories would be condemned as unscientific, and there would\nbe no way to discriminate among economic theories. One major problem\nwith a naive reading of Popper’s views is that\none cannot derive testable implications from theories by themselves.\nTo derive testable implications, one also needs subsidiary assumptions\nconcerning probability distributions, measurement devices, proxies for\nunmeasured variables, the absence of interferences, and so forth. This\nis the so-called “Duhem-Quine problem” (Duhem 1906, Quine\n1953, Cross 1982). These problems arise generally, and Popper proposes\nthat they be solved by a methodological decision to regard a failure\nof the deduced testable implication to be a failure of the theory. But\nin economics the subsidiary assumptions are dubious and in many cases\nknown to be false. Making the methodological decision that Popper\nrequires is unreasonable and would lead one to reject all economic\ntheories. \nImre Lakatos (1970), who was for most of his philosophical career a\nfollower of Popper, offers a broadly Popperian solution to this\nproblem. Lakatos insists that testing is always comparative. When\ntheories face empirical difficulties, as they always do, one attempts\nto modify them. Scientifically acceptable (in Lakatos’\nterminology “theoretically progressive”) modifications\nmust always have some additional testable implications; otherwise they\nare purely ad hoc. If some of the new predictions are\nconfirmed, then the modification is “empirically\nprogressive,” and one has reason to reject the unmodified theory\nand to employ the new theory, regardless of how unsuccessful in\ngeneral either theory may be. Though progress may be hard to come by,\nLakatos’ views do not have the same destructive implications as\nPopper’s. Lakatos appears to solve the problem of how to\nappraise mainstream economic theory by arguing that what matters is\nempirical progress or retrogression rather than empirical success or\nfailure. Lakatos’ views have thus been more attractive to\neconomic methodologists than Popper’s. \nDeveloping Thomas Kuhn’s notion of a “paradigm”\n(1970) and some hints from Popper, Lakatos also presented a view of\nthe global theory structure of whole theoretical enterprises, which he\ncalled “scientific research programmes.” Lakatos\nemphasized that there is a “hard core” of basic\ntheoretical propositions that define a research programme and that are\nnot to be questioned within the research programme. In addition\nmembers of a research programme accept a common body of heuristics\nthat guide them in the articulation and modification of specific\ntheories. These views have also been attractive to economic\nmethodologists, since theory development in economics is sharply\nconstrained and since economics appears at first glance to have a\n“hard core.” The fact that economists do not give up basic\ntheoretical postulates that appear to be false might be explained and\njustified by regarding them as part of the “hard core” of\nthe “neoclassical research programme”. \nYet Lakatos’ views do not provide a satisfactory account of how\neconomics can be a reputable science despite its reliance on extreme\nsimplifications. For it is questionable whether the development of\nneoclassical economic theory has demonstrated empirical progress. For\nexample, the replacement of “cardinal” utility theory by\n“ordinal” utility theory (see below\n Section 5.1)\n in the 1930s, which is generally regarded as a major step forward,\ninvolved the replacement of one theory by another that had no\nadditional empirical content. Furthermore, despite his emphasis on\nheuristics as guiding theory modification, Lakatos still emphasizes\ntesting. Science is for Lakatos more empirically driven than\nmainstream economics has been (Hands 1992). It is also doubtful whether\nresearch enterprises in economics have “hard cores”\n(Hoover 1991, Hausman 1992, ch. 6). For attempts to apply\nLakatos’ views to economics see Latsis (1976), and Weintraub\n(1985). As is apparent in de Marchi and Blaug (1991), writers on\neconomic methodology have in recent years become increasingly\ndisenchanted with Lakatos’ philosophy (Backhouse 2009). \nThere is a second major problem with Popper’s philosophy of\nscience, which plagues Lakatos’ views as well. Both maintain\nthat there is no such thing as empirical confirmation (for some late\nqualms, see Lakatos 1974). Popper and Lakatos maintain that evidence\nnever provides reason to believe that scientific claims are true, and\nboth also deny that results of tests can justify relying on statements\nin practical endeavours or in theoretical inquiry. There is no better\nevidence for one unfalsified proposition than for another. On this\nview, someone who questions whether there is enough evidence for some\nproposition to justify relying on it in theoretical studies or for\npolicy purposes would be making the methodological “error”\nof supposing that there can be evidence in support of hypotheses. With\nthe notable exception of Watkins (1984), few philosophers within the\nPopperian tradition have faced up to this challenging consequence. \nOne radical reaction to the difficulties of justifying the reliance on\nsevere simplifications is to deny that economics passes methodological\nmuster. Alexander Rosenberg (1992) maintains that economics can only\nmake imprecise generic predictions, and it cannot make progress,\nbecause it is built around folk psychology, which is a mediocre theory\nof human behavior and which (owing to the irreducibility of\nintentional notions) cannot be improved. Complex economic theories are\nscientifically valuable only as applied mathematics, not as empirical\ntheory. Since economics does not show the same consistent progress as\nthe natural sciences, one cannot dismiss Rosenberg’s suggestion\nthat economics is an empirical dead end. But his view that it has made\nno progress and that it does not permit quantitative\npredictions is hard to accept. For example, contemporary economists\nare much better at pricing stock options or designing auctions than\neconomists were even a generation ago. \nAn equally radical but opposite reaction is Deirdre McCloskey’s,\nwho denies that there are any non-trivial methodological standards\nthat economics must meet (1985, 1992, 1994, 2000, McCloskey and Ziliak\n2003, Ziliak and McCloskey 2008). In her view, the only relevant and\nsignificant criteria for assessing the practices and products of a\ndiscipline are those accepted by the practitioners. Apart from a few\ngeneral standards such as honesty and a willingness to listen to\ncriticisms, the only justifiable criteria for any conversation are\nthose of the participants. Economists can thus dismiss the arrogant\npretensions of philosophers to judge economic discourse. Whatever a\ngroup of respected economists takes to be good economics is\nautomatically good economics. Philosophical standards of empirical\nsuccess are just so much hot air. Those who are interested in\nunderstanding the character of economics and in contributing to its\nimprovement should eschew methodology and study instead the\n“rhetoric” of economics — that is, the means of\nargument and persuasion that succeed among economists. \nMcCloskey’s studies of the rhetoric of economics have been\nvaluable and influential (1985, esp. ch. 5–7, McCloskey and\nZiliak 2003, Ziliak and McCloskey 2008), but a great deal of her work\nduring the 1980s and 1990s consists of philosophical critiques of\neconomic methodology rather than studies of the rhetoric of economics.\nHer philosophical critiques are problematic, because the position\nsketched in the previous paragraph is hard to defend and potentially\nself-defeating. It is hard to defend, because epistemological\nstandards have already influenced the conversation of economists. The\nstandards of predictive success which lead one to have qualms about\neconomics are already standards that many economists accept. The only\nway to escape these doubts is to surrender the standards that gave\nrise to them. But McCloskey’s position undermines any principled\nargument for a change in standards. Furthermore, as Rosenberg has\nargued (1988), it seems that economists would doom themselves to\nirrelevance if they were to surrender standards of predictive success,\nfor it is upon such standards that policy decisions are made. \nMcCloskey does not, in fact, want to preclude the possibiity that\neconomists are sometimes persuaded when they should not be or are not\npersuaded when they should be. For she herself criticizes the bad\nhabit some economists have of conflating statistical significance with\neconomic importance (1985, ch. 9, McCloskey and Ziliak 2003, Ziliak\nand McCloskey 2008). McCloskey typically characterizes rhetoric\ndescriptively as the study of what in fact persuades, but sometimes\nshe instead characterizes it normatively as the study of what ought to\npersuade (1985, ch. 2). And if rhetoric is the study of what\nought rationally to persuade, then it is methodology, not an\nalternative to methodology. Questions about whether economics is a\nsuccessful empirical science cannot be conjured away. \nEconomic methodologist have paid little attention to debates within\nphilosophy of science between realists and anti-realists (van Fraassen\n1980, Boyd 1984, Psillos 1999, Niniluoto 2002, Chakravarty 2010,\nDicken 2016), because economic theories rarely postulate the existence\nof unobservable entities or properties, apart from variants of\n“everyday unobservables,” such as beliefs and desires.\nMethodologists have, on the other hand, vigorously debated the goals\nof economics, but those who argue that the ultimate goals are\npredictive (such as Milton Friedman) do so because of their interest\nin policy, not because they seek to avoid or resolve epistemological\nand semantic puzzles concerning references to unobservables. \nNevertheless there are two important recent realist programs in\neconomic methodology. The first, developed mainly by Uskali Mäki,\nis devoted to exploring the varieties of realism implicit in the\nmethodological statements and theoretical enterprises of economists\n(see Mäki 1990a, b, c, 2007, and Lehtinen, Kuorikoski and\nYlikoski 2012). The second, which is espoused by Tony Lawson and his\nco-workers, mainly at Cambridge University, derives from the work of\nRoy Bhaskar (1975) (see Lawson 1997, 2015, Bhaskar et al.\n1998, Fleetwood 1999, Brown and Fleetwood 2003, Ackroyd and Fleetwood\n2004, Edwards, Mahoney, and Vincent 2014). In Lawson’s view, one\ncan trace many of the inadequacies of mainstream economics (of which\nhe is a critic) to an insufficient concern with ontology. In\nattempting to identify regularities on the surface of the phenomena,\nmainstream economists are doomed to failure. Economic phenomena are in\nfact influenced by a large number of different causal factors, and one\ncan achieve scientific knowledge only of the underlying mechanisms and\ntendencies, whose operation can be glimpsed intermittently and\nobscurely in observable relations. Mäki’s and\nLawson’s programs have little to do with one another, though\nMäki (like Mill, Cartwright, and Hausman) shares Lawson’s\nand Bhaskar’s concern with underlying causal mechanisms. See\nalso the entry on\n scientific realism. \nThroughout its history, economics has been the subject of sociological\nas well as methodological scrutiny. Many sociological discussions of\neconomics, like Marx’s critique of classical political economy,\nhave been concerned to identify ideological distortions and thereby to\ncriticize particular aspects of economic theory and economic policy.\nSince every political program finds economists who testify to its\neconomic virtues, there is a never-ending source of material for such\ncritiques. For example, in the wake of the near collapse of the\ninternational financial system in 2008, American economists who argued\nfor austerity were mostly Republicans, while those who defended\nefforts to increase aggregate demand were mostly Democrats. \nThe influence of contemporary sociology of science and social studies\nof science, coupled with the difficulties methodologists have had\nmaking sense of and rationalizing the conduct of economics, have led\nto efforts at fusing economics and sociology (Granovetter 1985,\nSwedberg 1990, 2007) as well as to a sociological turn within\nmethodological reflection itself. Rather than showing that there is\ngood evidence supporting developments in economic theory or that those\ndevelopments have other broadly epistemic virtues, methodologists and\nhistorians such as D. Wade Hands (2001); Hands and Mirowski 1998),\nPhilip Mirowski (1990, 2002, 2004, 2013), and E. Roy Weintraub (1991)\nhave argued that these changes reflect a wide variety of non-rational\nfactors, from changes in funding for theoretical economics, political\ncommitments, personal rivalries, attachments to metaphors, or\nmathematical interests. \nFurthermore, many of the same methodologists and historians have\nargued that economics is not only an object of social inquiry, but\nthat it can be a tool of social inquiry into science. By studying the\nincentive structure of scientific disciplines and the implicit or\nexplicit market forces impinging on research (including of course\nresearch in economics), it should be possible to write the economics\nof science and the economics of economics itself (Hands 1995, Hull\n1988, Leonard 2002, Mirowski and Sent 2002). \nExactly how, if at all, this work is supposed to bear on questions\nconcerning how well supported are the claims economists make is not\nclear. Though eschewing traditional methodology, Mirowski’s\nmonograph on the role of physical analogy in economics (1990) is often\nvery critical of mainstream economics. In his Reflection without\nRules (2001) D. W. Hands maintains that general methodological\nrules are of little use. He defends a naturalistic view of methodology\nand is skeptical of prescriptions that are not based on detailed\nknowledge. But he does not argue that no rules apply. \nThe above survey of approaches to the fundamental problems of\nappraising economic theory is far from complete. For example, there\nhave been substantial efforts to apply structuralist views of\nscientific theories (Sneed 1971, Stegmüller 1976, 1979) to\neconomics (Stegmüller et al. 1981, Hamminga 1983, Hands 1985c,\nBalzer and Hamminga 1989). The above discussion documents the\ndiversity and disagreements concerning how to interpret and appraise\neconomic theories. It is not surprising that there is no consensus\namong those writing on economic methodology concerning the overall\nempirical appraisal of specific approaches in economics, including\nmainstream microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. When\npractitioners cannot agree, it is questionable whether those who know\nmore philosophy but less economics will be able to settle the matter.\nSince the debates continue, those who reflect on economic methodology\nshould have a continuing part to play. \nMeanwhile, there are many other more specific methodological questions\nto address, and it is a sign of the maturity of the subdiscipline that\na large and increasing percentage of work on economic methodology\naddresses more specific questions. There is plethora of work, as a\nperusal of any recent issue of the Journal of Economic\nMethodology or Economics and Philosophy will confirm.\nSome of the range of issues currently under discussion were mentioned\nabove in\n Section 2.\n Here is a list of three of the many areas of current interest: \n1. Although more concerned with the content of economics than with its\nmethodology, the recent explosion of work on feminist economics is\nshot through with methodological and sociological self-reflection. The\nfact that a considerably larger percentage of economists are men than\nis true of any of the other social sciences and indeed than most of\nthe natural sciences raises questions about whether there is something\nparticularly masculine about the discipline. Important texts are\nFerber and Nelson (1993, 2003), Nelson (1995, 1996, 2001), Barker and\nKuiper (2003). Since 1995, there has been a journal, Feminist\nEconomics, which pulls together much of this work. \n2. During the past decades, laboratory experimentation in economics\nhas expanded rapidly. Laboratory experimentation has many different\nobjectives (see Roth 1988) and apparently holds out the prospect of\nbridging the gulf between fundamental economic theory and empirical\nevidence. Some of it casts light on the way in which methodological\ncommitments influence the extent to which economists heed empirical\nevidence. A good deal of laboratory experimentation in contemporary\neconomics is in the service of behavioral economics, which prides\nitself on heeding experimental evidence concerning the structure and\ndeterminants of individual choices. Although behavioral economics has\nsecured a foothold within mainstream economics, it remains\ncontroversial substantively and methodologically, and its implications\nfor normative economics, discussed below in section 6, are\ncontroversial. \nFor example, in the case of preference reversals, discussed briefly\nbelow in Section 5.1, economists devoted considerable attention to the\nexperimental findings and conceded that they disconfirmed central\nprinciples of economics. But economists have been generally unwilling\nto pay serious attention to the theories proposed by psychologists\nthat predicted the phenomena before they were observed. The reason\nseems to be that these psychological theories do not have the same\nwide scope as the basic principles of mainstream economics (Hausman\n1992, chapter 13). Hesitation concerning neuroeconomics (Camerer\net al. 2005, Camerer 2009, Marchionni and Vromen 2014,\nRustichini 2005, 2009, Glimcher and Fehr 2013, Reuter and Montag 2016,\nVromen and Marchionni 2018) is also common. In an extremely\ninfluential essay, “The Case for Mindless Economics.” Gul\nand Pesandorfer (2008) argue that the findings of behavioral economics\n(and neuroeconomics) are irrelevant to economics. They are at most of\nheuristic value. They maintain that the findings of behavioral\neconomics are irrelevant to economics, because they do not concern\nmarket choices and their consequences, which are the only germane\ndata. Sometimes Gul and Pesandorfer appear to identify economic theory\nwith the empirical\nconsequences economists are concerned with, while at other points they\necho Milton Friedman (see section 3.2) and deny that the\n“realism” of the “assumptions” of economic\nmodels matters. They do not address sophisticated defenses of realism\nconcerning mental states like Dietrich and List (2016). It seems to me\nthat theoretical resistance to engaging\nwith behavioral economists like that one finds in Gul and\nPesandorfer’s essay is weakening. But it is clear that the\nmethodological commitments governing theoretical economics are much\nmore complex and more specific to economics than the general rules\nproposed by philosophers such as Popper and Lakatos. \nThe relevance of laboratory experimentation remains controversial.\nBehavioral economists are enthusiastic, while more traditional\ntheorists question whether experimental findings can be generalized to\nnon-experimental contexts and, more generally, concerning the\npossibilities of learning from experiments (Caplin and Schotter 2008).\nFor discussions of experimental economics, see Guala (2000a, b, 2005),\nHey (1991), Kagel and Roth (1995, 2016), Plott (1991), Smith (1991),\nStarmer (1999), Camerer (2003), Bardsley and Cubitt 2009, Durlauf and\nBlume (2009), Branas-Garza and Cabrales (2015), Fréchette and\nSchotter (2015), Jacquemet and L’Haridon (2018), and the June,\n2005 special issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology. Al\nRoth’s Game Theory, Experimental Economics, and Market Design\nPage (http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/alroth.html) is a useful\nsource. For recent work on behavioral economics see the Journal of\nBehavioral Economics, the Review of Behavioral\nEconomics, and Behavioural Public Policy. \n3. During the past generation, there has been a radical transformation\nin the attitudes of economists toward empirical causal inquiry,\nespecially in the form of field experiments and natural experiments,\noften employing instrumental variables. For example, about two-thirds\nof the articles in the February, 2018 American Economic\nReview are based on empirical studies. The titles of the first\nfour entries in the table of contents are: “The Effects of\nPretrial Detention on Conviction, Future Crime, and Employment:\nEvidence from Randomly Assigned Judges,” “Implications of\nUS Tax Policy for House Prices, Rents, and Homeownership,”\n“The Welfare Cost of Perceived Policy Uncertainty: Evidence from\nSocial Security,” “The Economic Consequences of Hospital\nAdmissions.” If one goes back twenty-five years, only about\none-eighth of the first issue of the 1993 American Economic\nReview appear to rely on any empirical studies. The first four\nentries are: “Today’s Task for Economists,”\n“Trigger Points and Budget Cuts: Explaining the Effects of\nFiscal Austerity,” “Economic Policy, Economic Performance,\nand Elections,” “The Macroeconomics of Dr.\nStrangelove.” A Rip Van Winkle who had gone to sleep in 1983\nreading the principal economics journals would be staggered when he\nawoke in 2018. \nField experiments have been especially important in development\neconomics where the results of various foreign aid projects have too\noften provided meagre benefits. One can find good introductions to\nthis work in Carpenter et al. (2005), Duflo and Banerjee\n(2011, 2017), Gugerty and Karlan (2018), Karlan and Appel (2011,\n2016), Kremer and Glennerster (2011), List and Samek (2018), and\nMullainathan and Shafir (2013). See also the\n Poverty Action Lab.\n Although field experiments appear to be hard-nosed inquiries that\nestablish what works and what does not work, matters are not so simple\n(Deaton 2010, Cartwright and Hardie 2013). Without knowledge of the\nmechanisms, it is all too easy for an intervention that works\nsplendidly at a specific time and place to fail abysmally when tried\nelsewhere. Atheoretical inquiry, even when methodologically\nsophisticated, has severe limits as a tactic of knowledge\nacquisition. \nThe empirical turn in economics has also had the effect of increasing\nthe importance of economic history. With some ingenuity, especially in\nidentifying possible instrumental variables, history is full of\n“natural experiments.” For example (J. Hausman 2016), in\n1936, the American Congress voted to pay pensions to veterans of World\nWar I eight years before they were due to be paid. Because the\npercentages of veterans differed across states, Hausman can use the\ndiffering economic performances of states to estimate the effects of\nthe economic stimulus the pensions provided. Although less decisive\nthan randomized controlled trials (which are often impossible to carry\nout), examination of historical episodes such as this one provide\nsignificant evidence concerning economic hypotheses. \nInsofar as economics explains and predicts phenomena as consequences\nof individual choices, which are themselves explained in terms of alleged\nreasons, it must depict agents as to some extent rational.\nRationality, like reasons, involves evaluation, and just as one can\nassess the rationality of individual choices, so one can assess the\nrationality of social choices and examine how they are and ought to be\nrelated to the preferences and judgments of individuals. In addition,\nthere are intricate questions concerning rationality in strategic\nsituations in which outcomes depend on the choices of multiple\nindividuals. Since rationality is a central concept in branches of\nphilosophy such as action theory, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy\nof mind, studies of rationality frequently cross the boundaries\nbetween economics and philosophy. \nThe barebones theory of rationality discussed above in\n Section 1.1\n takes an agent’s\n preferences\n (rankings of states of affairs) to be rational if they are complete\nand transitive, and it takes the agent’s choice to be rational\nif the agent does not prefer any feasible alternative to the one he or\nshe chooses. Such a theory of rationality is clearly too weak, because\nit says nothing about belief or what rationality implies when agents\ndo not know (with certainty) everything relevant to their choices. But\nit may also be too strong, since, as Isaac Levi in particular has\nargued (1986), there is nothing irrational about having incomplete\npreferences in situations involving uncertainty. Sometimes it is\nrational to suspend judgment and to refuse to rank alternatives that\nare not well understood. On the other hand, transitivity is a\nplausible condition, and the so-called “money pump”\nargument demonstrates that if one’s preferences are intransitive\nand one is willing to make exchanges, then one can be exploited.\n(Suppose an agent A prefers X to Y,\nY to Z and Z to X, and that\nA will pay some small amount of money $P to exchange\nY for X, Z for Y, and X\nfor Z. That means that, starting with Z, A\nwill pay $P for Y, then $P again for\nX, then $P again for Z and so on. Agents\nare not this stupid. They will instead refuse to trade or adjust their\npreferences to eliminate the intransitivity (but see Schick 1986). \nOn the other hand, there is considerable experimental evidence that\npeople’s preferences are not in fact transitive. Such evidence\ndoes not establish that transitivity is not a requirement of\nrationality. It may show instead that people are sometimes irrational.\nIn the case of so-called “preference reversals,” for\nexample, it seems plausible that people in fact make irrational\nchoices (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971, Tversky and Thaler 1990).\nEvidence of persistent violations of transitivity is disquieting,\nsince standards of rationality should not be impossibly high. \nA further difficulty with the barebones theory of rationality concerns\nthe individuation of the objects of preference or choice. Consider,\nfor example, data from multistage ultimatum games. Suppose A\ncan propose any division of $10 between A and B.\nB can accept or reject A’s proposal. If\nB rejects the proposal, then the amount of money drops to $5,\nand B gets to offer a division of the $5 which A can\naccept or reject. If A rejects B’s offer, then\nboth players get nothing. Suppose that A proposes to divide\nthe money with $7 for A and $3 for B. B\ndeclines and offers to split the $5 evenly, with $2.50 for each.\nBehavior such as this is, in fact, common (Ochs and Roth 1989, p.\n362). Assuming that B prefers more money to less, these\nchoices appear to be a violation of transitivity. B prefers\n$3 to $2.50, yet declines $3 for certain for $2.50 (with some slight\nchance of A declining and B getting nothing). But\nthe objects of choice are not just quantities of money. B is\nturning down $3 as part of “a raw deal” in favor of $2.50\nas part of a fair arrangement. If the objects of choice are defined in\nthis way, there is no failure of transitivity. \nThis plausible observation gives rise to a serious problem. Unless\nthere are constraints on how the objects of choice are individuated,\nconditions of rationality such as transitivity are empty.\nA’s choice of X over Y, Y\nover Z and Z over X does not violate\ntransitivity if “X when the alternative is\nY” is not the same object of choice as\n“X when the alternative is Z”. John\nBroome (1991) argues that further substantive principles of\nrationality are required to limit how alternatives are individuated or\nto require that agents be indifferent between alternatives such as\n“X when the alternative is Y” and\n“X when the alternative is Z.” \nTo extend the theory of rationality to circumstances involving\n risk\n (where the objects of choice are lotteries with known probabilities)\nand uncertainty (where agents do not know the probabilities or even\nall the possible outcomes of their choices) requires further\nprinciples of rationality, as well as controversial technical\nsimplifications. Subjective Bayesians suppose that individuals in\ncircumstances of uncertainty have well-defined subjective\nprobabilities (degrees of belief) over all the payoffs and thus that\nthe objects of choice can be modeled as lotteries, just as in\ncircumstances involving risk, though with subjective probabilities in\nplace of objective probabilities. See the entries on\n Bayes’ theorem\n and\n Bayesian epistemology.\n The most important of the axioms needed for the theory of rational\nchoice under conditions of risk and uncertainty is the independence\ncondition. It says roughly that the preferences of rational agent\nbetween two lotteries that differ in only one outcome should match\ntheir preferences between the differing outcomes. Although initially\nplausible, the independence condition is very controversial. See\nAllais and Hagen (1979) and McClennen (1983, 1990). \nA considerable part of rational choice theory is concerned with\nformalizations of conditions of rationality and investigation of their\nimplications. When an agent’s preferences are complete and\ntransitive and satisfy a further continuity condition, then they can\nbe represented by a so-called ordinal utility function. What this\nmeans is that it is possible to define a function that represents an\nagent’s preferences so that U(X) >\nU(Y) if and only if the agent prefers X to\nY, and U(X) = U(Y) if and\nonly if the agent is indifferent between X and Y.\nThis function merely represents the preference ranking. It contains no\ninformation beyond the ranking. Any order-preserving transformation of\n“U” would represent the agent’s preferences\njust as well. \nWhen an agent’s preferences in addition satisfy the independence\ncondition and some other technical conditions, then they can be\nrepresented by an expected utility function (Harsanyi 1977b, ch. 4,\nHernstein and Milnor 1953, Ramsey 1926, and Savage 1972). Such a\nfunction has two important properties. First, the expected utility of\na lottery is equal to the sum of the (expected) utilities of its\nprizes weighted by their probabilities. Second, expected utility\nfunctions are unique up to a positive affine transformation. What this\nmeans is that if U and V are both expected utility\nfunctions representing the preferences of an agent, then for all\nobjects of preference, X, V(X) must be\nequal to aU(X) + b, where\na and b are real numbers and a is positive.\nIn addition, the axioms of rationality imply that the agent’s\ndegrees of belief will satisfy the axioms of the probability\ncalculus. \nA great deal of controversy surrounds the theory of rationality, and\nthere have been many formal investigations into weakened or amended\ntheories of rationality. For further discussion, see Allais and Hagen\n1979, Barberà, Hammond and Seidl 1999, Kahneman and Tversky\n1979, Loomes and Sugden 1982, Luce and Raiffa 1957, Machina\n1987, and Gilboa and Schmeidler 2001. \nAlthough societies are very different from individuals, they have\nmechanisms to evaluate alternatives and make choices, and their\nevaluations and choices may be rational or irrational. It is not,\nhowever, obvious, what principles of rationality should govern the\nchoices and evaluations of society. Transitivity is one plausible\ncondition. It seems that a society that chooses X when faced\nwith the alternatives X or Y, Y when faced\nwith the alternatives Y or Z and Z when\nfaced with the alternatives X or Z either has had a\nchange of heart or is choosing irrationally. Yet, purported\nirrationalities such as these can easily arise from standard\nmechanisms that aim to link social choices and individual preferences.\nSuppose there are three individuals in the society. Individual One\nranks the alternatives X, Y, Z. Individual\nTwo ranks them Y, Z, X. Individual Three\nranks them Z, X, Y. If decisions are made\nby pairwise majority voting, X will be chosen from the pair\n(X, Y), Y will be chosen from (Y,\nZ), and Z will be chosen from (X,\nZ). Clearly this is unsettling, but are possible cycles in\nsocial choices irrational? \nSimilar problems affect what one might call the logical coherence of\nsocial judgments (List and Pettit 2002). Suppose society consists of\nthree individuals who make the following judgments concerning the\ntruth or falsity of the propositions P and Q and\nthat social judgment follows the majority. \nThe judgments of each of the individuals are consistent with the\nprinciples of logic, while social judgments violate them. How\nimportant is it that social judgments be consistent with the\nprinciples of logic? \nAlthough social choice theory in this way bears on questions of social\nrationality, most work in social choice theory explores the\nconsequences of principles of rationality coupled with explicitly\nethical constraints. The seminal contribution is Kenneth\nArrow’s impossibility theorem (1963, 1967). Arrow assumes that\nboth individual preferences and social preferences are complete and\ntransitive and that the method of forming social preferences (or making\nsocial choices) issues in some social preference ranking or social\nchoice for any possible profile of\nindividual preferences. In addition, Arrow imposes a weak unanimity\ncondition: if everybody prefers X to Y, then\nY must not be socially preferred. Third, he requires that there be no\ndictator whose preferences determine social preferences or choices irrespective of\nthe preferences of anybody else. Lastly, he imposes the condition that\nthe social preference between X and Y should depend on\nhow individuals rank X and Y and on nothing else.\nArrow then proved the surprising result that no method of relating\nsocial and individual preferences can satisfy all these\nconditions! \nIn the sixty years since Arrow wrote, there has been a plethora of\nwork in social choice theory, a good deal of which is arguably of\ngreat importance to ethics. For example, John Harsanyi proved that if\nindividual preferences and social evaluations both satisfy the axioms\nof expected utility theory (with shared or objective probabilities)\nand that social preferences conform to unanimous individual\npreferences, then social evaluations are determined by a weighted sum\nof individual utilities (1955, 1977a). Matthew Adler (2012) has\nextended an approach like Harsanyi’s to demonstrate that a form\nof weighted utilitarianism, which prioritizes the interests of those\nwho are worse off, uniquely satisfies a longer list of rational and\nethical constraints. When there are instead disagreements in\nprobability assignments, there is an impossibility result: the\nunanimity condition implies that for some profiles of individual\npreferences, social evaluations will not satisfy the axioms of\nexpected utility theory (Hammond 1983, Seidenfeld, et al.\n1989, Mongin 1995). For further discussion of social choice theory and\nthe relevance of utility theory to social evaluation, see the entry on\n social choice theory, Sen (1970)\nand for recent reappraisals Fleurbaey (2007) and Adler (2012). \nWhen outcomes depend on what several agents do, one agent’s best\nchoice may depend on what other agents choose. Although the principles\nof rationality governing individual choice still apply, arguably there\nare further principles of rationality governing expectations of the\nactions of others (and of their expectations concerning your actions\nand expectations, and so forth). Game theory occupies an increasingly\nimportant role within economics, and it is also relevant both to\ninquiries concerning rationality and inquiries concerning ethics. For\nfurther discussion see the entries on\n game theory,\n game theory and ethics, and\n evolutionary game theory. \nAs discussed above in\n Section 2.1\n most economists distinguish between positive and normative economics,\nand most would argue that economics is relevant to policy mainly\nbecause of the (positive) information it provides concerning the\nconsequences of policy. Yet the same economists also offer their\nadvice concerning how to fix the economy, and there is a whole field\nof normative economics. \nEconomic outcomes, institutions, and processes may be better or worse\nin several different ways. Some outcomes may make people better off.\nOther outcomes may be less unequal. Others may restrict individual\nfreedom more severely. Economists typically evaluate outcomes\nexclusively in terms of welfare. This does not imply that they believe\nthat only welfare is of moral importance. They focus on welfare,\nbecause they believe that economics provides an excellent set of tools\nto address questions of welfare and because they hope that questions\nabout welfare can be separated from questions about equality, freedom,\nor justice. As sketched below, economists have had some things to say\nabout other dimensions of moral appraisal, but welfare takes center\nstage. Indeed normative economics is standardly called “welfare\neconomics.” \nOne central question of moral philosophy has been to determine what\nthings are intrinsically good for human beings. This is a central\nquestion, because all plausible moral views assign an important place\nto individual welfare or\n well-being.\n This is obviously true of utilitarianism (which holds that what is\nright maximizes total or average welfare), but even non-utilitarian\nviews are concerned with welfare, if they recognize the virtue of\nbenevolence, or if they are concerned with the interests of\nindividuals or with avoiding harm to individuals. \nThere are many ways to think about well-being, and the prevailing view\namong economists has shifted from hedonism (which takes the good to be\na mental state such as pleasure or happiness) to the view that welfare\nshould be measured by the satisfaction of preferences. A number of\nprominent economists are currently arguing for a return to hedonism,\nbut they remain a minority. (See Bavetta et al. 2014. Clark\nFlèche 2018, Dolan and Kahneman 2014, Frey 2010, 2018, Frey and\nStutzer 2001, Kahneman 1999, 2000a, 2000b, Kahneman and Krueger 2006,\nKahneman and Sugden 2005, Kahneman and Thaler 2006, Layard 2006,\nOrmerod 2008, Radcliff 2013, Weimann and Knabe 2015 and for criticism\nDavies 2015, Etzioni 2018, and Hausman 2010.) Unlike hedonism, taking\nwelfare to be preference satisfaction specifies how to find out what\nis good for a person rather than committing itself to any substantive\nview of a person’s good. Note that equating welfare with the\nsatisfaction of preferences is not equating welfare with any\nfeeling of satisfaction. If welfare can be measured by the\nsatisfaction of preferences, then a person is better off if what he or\nshe prefers comes to pass, regardless of whether that occurrence makes\nthe agent feel satisfied. \nSince mainstream economics attributes a consistent preference ordering\nto all agents, and since more specific models typically take agents to\nbe well-informed and self-interested, it is easy for economists to\naccept the view that an individual agent A will prefer\nX to Y if and only if X is in fact better\nfor A than Y is. This is one place where positive\ntheory bleeds into normative theory. In addition, the identification\nof welfare with the satisfaction of preferences is attractive to\neconomists, because it prevents questions about the justification of\npaternalism (to which most economists are strongly opposed) from even\narising. \nWelfare and the satisfaction of preferences may coincide because the\nsatisfaction of preferences constitutes welfare or because people are\nself-interested and good judges of their own interests and hence\nprefer what is good for them. There are many obvious objections to the\nview that the satisfaction of preferences constitutes welfare.\nPreferences may be based on mistaken beliefs. People may prefer to\nsacrifice their own well-being for some purpose they value more\nhighly. Preferences may reflect past manipulation or distorting\npsychological influences (Elster 1983). In addition, if preference\nsatisfaction constitutes welfare, then policy makers can make people\nbetter off by molding their wants rather than by improving conditions.\nFurthermore, it seems unreasonable that social policy should attend to\nextravagant preferences. Rather than responding to these objections\nand attempting to defend the view that preference satisfaction\nconstitutes well-being, economists can blunt these objections by\ntaking preferences in circumstances where people are self-interested\nand good judges of their interests to be merely good evidence of what\nwill promote welfare (Hausman and McPherson 2009, Hausman 2012). There\nare some exceptions, most notably Amartya Sen (1987a,b,c, 1992), but\nmost economists take welfare to coincide with the satisfaction of\npreference. \nBecause the identification of welfare with preference satisfaction\nmakes it questionable whether one can make interpersonal welfare\ncomparisons, few economists defend a utilitarian view of policy as\nmaximizing total or average welfare. (Harsanyi is one exception, for\nanother see Ng 1983). Economists have instead explored the possibility\nof making welfare assessments of economic processes, institutions,\noutcomes, and policies without making interpersonal comparisons.\nConsider two economic outcomes S and R, and suppose\nthat some people prefer S to R and that nobody\nprefers R to S. In that case S is\n“Pareto superior” to R, or S is a\n“Pareto improvement” over R. Without making any\ninterpersonal comparisons, one can conclude that people’s\npreferences are better satisfied in S than in R. If\nthere is no state of affairs that is Pareto superior to S,\nthen economists say that S is “Pareto optimal” or\n“Pareto efficient.” Efficiency here is efficiency with\nrespect to satisfying preferences rather than minimizing the number of\ninputs needed to produce a unit of output or some other technical\nnotion (Le Grand 1991). If a state of affairs is not Pareto efficient,\nthen society is missing an opportunity costlessly to satisfy some\npeople’s preferences better. A Pareto efficient state of affairs\navoids this failure, but it has no other obvious virtues. For example,\nsuppose nobody is satiated and people care only about how much food\nthey get. Consider two distributions of food. In the first, millions\nare starving but no food is wasted. In the second, nobody is starving,\nbut some food is wasted. The first is Pareto efficient, while the\nsecond is not. \nThe notions of Pareto improvements and Pareto efficiency might seem\nuseless, because economic policies almost always have both winners and\nlosers. Mainstream economists have nevertheless found these concepts\nuseful in two ways. First, they have proved two theorems concerning\nproperties of perfectly competitive equilibria (Arrow 1968). The first\ntheorem says that equilibria in perfectly competitive markets are\nPareto optimal, and the second says that any Pareto optimal\nallocation, with whatever distribution of income policy makers might\nprefer, can be achieved as a perfectly competitive market equilibrium,\nprovided that one begins with just the right distribution of\nendowments among economic agents. The first theorem has been regarded\nas underwriting Adam Smith’s view of the invisible hand (Arrow\nand Hahn 1971, preface; Hahn 1973). This interpretation is\nproblematic, because no economy has ever been or will ever be in\nperfectly competitive equilibrium. The second theorem provides some\njustification for the normative division of labor economists prefer,\nwith economists concerned about efficiency and others concerned about\njustice. The thought is that the second theorem shows that theories of\njust distribution are compatible with reliance on competitive markets.\nThe two fundamental theorems of welfare economics go some way toward\nexplaining why mainstream economists, whether they support\nlaissez-faire policies or government intervention to remedy\nmarket imperfections, think of perfectly competitive equilibria as\nideals. But the significance of the theorems is debatable, since\nactual markets differ significantly from perfectly competitive markets\nand, when there are multiple market imperfections, the “theory\nof the second best” shows that fixing some of the imperfections\nmay lead the society away from a perfectly competitive equilibrium\n(and diminish efficiency and welfare) rather than toward one (Lipsey\nand Lancaster 1956–7). \nThe other way that economists have found to extend the Pareto\nefficiency notions leads to cost-benefit analysis, which is a\npractical tool for policy analysis (Mishan 1971; Sugden and Williams\n1978; Adler and Posner 2000, 2006; Broadman et al. 2010;\nBoadway 2016). Suppose that S is not a Pareto improvement\nover R. Some members of the society would be losers in a\nshift from R to S. Those losers prefer R to\nS, but there are enough winners — enough people who\nprefer S to R — that the winners\ncould compensate the losers and make the preference for\nS′ (S with compensation paid) over R\nunanimous. S is a “potential Pareto improvement”\nover R. In other terms, the amount of money the winners would\nbe willing to pay to bring about the change is larger than the amount\nof money the losers would have to be compensated so as not to object\nto the change. (Economists are skeptical about what one learns from\nasking people how much they would be willing to pay, and they attempt\ninstead to infer how much individuals are willing to pay indirectly\nfrom market phenomena.) When S is a potential Pareto\nimprovement over R, there is said to be a “net\nbenefit” to the policy of bringing about S. According\nto cost-benefit analysis, among eligible policies (which satisfy legal\nand moral constraints), one should, other things being equal, employ\nthe one with the largest net benefit. Note that the compensation is\nentirely hypothetical. Potential Pareto improvements result in winners\nand losers, the justice or injustice of which is irrelevant to\ncost-benefit analysis. Justice or beneficence may require that the\nsociety do something to mitigate distributional imbalances. Because\nthere is a larger “pie” of goods and services to satisfy\npreferences (since compensation could be paid and everybody’s\npreferences better satisfied), selecting policies with the greatest\nnet benefit serves economic efficiency (Hicks 1939, Kaldor 1939). \nDespite the practical importance of cost-benefit analysis, the\ntechnique and the justification for it sketched in the previous\nparagraph are problematic. One technical difficulty is that it is\npossible for S to be a potential Pareto improvement over\nR and for R to be a potential Pareto improvement\nover S (Scitovsky 1941, Samuelson 1950)! That means that the\nfact that S is a potential Pareto improvement over R\ndoes not imply that there is a larger economic “pie” in\nS than in R, because there cannot, of course, be a\nlarger economic pie in S than in R and a larger\neconomic pie in R than in S. A second problem is\nthat willingness to pay for some policy and the amount one would\nrequire in compensation if one opposes the policy depend on how much\nwealth one has as well as on one’s attitude to the policy.\nCost-benefit analysis weights the preferences of the rich more than\nthe preferences of the poor (Baker 1975). It is possible to compensate\nroughly for the effects of income and wealth (Harburger 1978,\nFankhauser et al. 1997), but it is bothersome to do so, and\ncost-benefit analysis is commonly employed without any adjustment for\nwealth or income. \nA further serious difficulty for traditional welfare economics, which\nhas been as it were hiding in plain sight, is the fact that choices\nare imperfect indicators of preferences, which are in turn imperfect\nindicators of what enhances well-being. The same facts that show that\npreference satisfaction does not constitute well-being (false beliefs,\nlack of information, other-directed and non-rational preferences) show\nthat choices and preferences are sometimes misleading indicators of\nwell-being. Moreover, once one recognizes that preferences are good\nindicators of welfare only if agents are good judges of what will\nbenefit them, one is bound to recognize that agents are not always\ngood judges of what will benefit themselves, even when they have all\nthe information they need. In some contexts, these problems may be\nminor. For example, people’s preferences among new automobiles\nare largely self-interested, thoughtful, and well-informed. In other\ncontexts, such as environmental protection, preferences for ignoring\nthe problems are often badly informed, while preferences to take\naction are typically not self-interested. Either way, popular\npreferences among policies to address environmental problems are\nunlikely to be a good guide to welfare. \nIgnoring these problems has been a great convenience to normative\neconomics. If what people choose reveals their preferences, which in\nturn indicate what is good for them, then, as noted before, government\naction to steer someone’s choices can never make that person\nbetter off, and so questions about whether to endorse paternalistic\npolicies cannot arise. But whether or not it is advisable, successful\npaternalism is not impossible; and recent work by behavioral\neconomists, which document a wide variety of systematic deliberative\nfoibles, has put questions concerning paternalism back on the table\n(Ariely 2009, Kahneman 2011). Some economists have searched for ways to\nidentify an agent’s “true” preferences (as described\nby Infante et al. 2016). Others have argued that policy\nmakers must respect the preferences of agents among their ends or\nobjectives, while overruling preferences among means when these are\ndistorted by bad judgment or false beliefs (Thaler and Sunstein 2008,\nLe Grand and New 2015). Moreover, Thaler and Sunstein’s proposal\nthat government explore non-coercive methods of influencing people to\nmake better choices (“nudges”) has been popular among\npolicy makers and has arguably shifted philosophical discussion of\npaternalism away from Mill’s (1859) focus on avoiding coercion\n(Shiffrin 2000, Hausman and Welch 2010, Le Grand and New 2015). \nAlthough welfare economics and concerns about efficiency dominate\nnormative economics, they do not exhaust the subject, and in\ncollaboration with philosophers, economists have made important\ncontributions to contemporary work in ethics and normative social and\npolitical philosophy.\n Section 5.2\n and\n Section 5.3\n gave some hint of the contributions of social choice theory and game\ntheory. In addition economists and philosophers have worked on the\nproblem of providing a formal characterization of freedom so as to\nbring tools of economic analysis to bear (Pattanaik and Xu 1990, Sen\n1988, 1990, 1991, Carter 1999, Sugden 2018). Others have developed\nformal characterizations of social welfare functions that prioritize\nthe interests of those who are less well off or that favor equality of\nresources, opportunity, and outcomes and that separate individual and\nsocial responsibility for inequalities (Pazner and Schmeidler 1974,\nVarian 1974, 1975, Roemer 1986b, 1987, Fleurbaey 1995, 2008, Fleurbaey\nand Maniquet 2014, Greaves 2015, McCarthy 2015, 2017). John Roemer has\nput contemporary economic modeling to work to offer precise\ncharacterizations of exploitation (1982). Amartya Sen and Martha\nNussbaum have not only developed novel interpretations of the proper\nconcerns of normative economics in terms of capabilities (Sen 1992,\nNussbaum and Sen 1993, Nussbaum 2000), which Sen has linked to\ncharacterizations of egalitarianism and to operational measures of\ndeprivation (1999). There are many lively interactions between\nnormative economics and moral philosophy. See also the entries on\n libertarianism,\n paternalism,\n egalitarianism,\n and\n economic justice. \nThe frontiers between economics and philosophy concerned with\nmethodology, rationality, ethics and normative social and political\nphilosophy are buzzing with activity. This activity is diverse and\nconcerned with very different questions. Although many of these are\nrelated, philosophy of economics is not a single unified enterprise.\nIt is a collection of separate inquiries linked to one another by\nconnections among the questions and by the dominating influence of\nmainstream economic models and techniques.","contact.mail":"dhausman@cplb.rutgers.edu","contact.domain":"cplb.rutgers.edu"}]
