This crisis flared up just as \nuniversities were being founded. Thomas, after early studies at \nMontecassino, moved on to the University of Naples, where he met \nmembers of the new Dominican Order. It was at Naples too that Thomas \nhad his first extended contact with the new learning. When he joined \nthe Dominican Order he went north to study with Albertus Magnus, \nauthor of a paraphrase of the Aristotelian corpus. Thomas \ncompleted his studies at the University of Paris, which had been \nformed out of the monastic schools on the Left Bank and the cathedral\nschool at Notre Dame. In two stints as a regent master Thomas \ndefended the mendicant orders and, of greater historical importance, \ncountered both the Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle and the \nFranciscan tendency to reject Greek philosophy. The result was a new \nmodus vivendi between faith and philosophy which survived\nuntil the rise of the new physics. The Catholic Church has over the\ncenturies regularly and consistently reaffirmed the central importance\nof Thomas's work, both theological and philosophical, for\nunderstanding its teachings concerning the Christian revelation, and\nhis close textual commentaries on Aristotle represent a cultural\nresource which is now receiving increased recognition. The following\naccount concentrates on Thomas the philosopher. \n\n\n\nThomas was born in 1225 at Roccasecca, a hilltop castle from which \nthe great Benedictine abbey of Montecassino is not quite visible, \nmidway between Rome and Naples. At the age of five, he was entered at\nMontecassino where his studies began. When the monastery became a \nbattle site—not for the last time—Thomas was transferred \nby his family to the University of Naples. It was here that he came \ninto contact with the “new” Aristotle and with the Order \nof Preachers or Dominicans, a recently founded mendicant order. He \nbecame a Dominican over the protests of his family and eventually \nwent north to study, perhaps first briefly at Paris, then at Cologne \nwith Albert the Great, whose interest in Aristotle strengthened \nThomas's own predilections. Returned to Paris, he completed his \nstudies, became a Master and for three years occupied one of the \nDominican chairs in the Faculty of Theology. The next ten years were \nspent in various places in Italy, with the mobile papal court, at \nvarious Dominican houses, and eventually in Rome. From there he was \ncalled back to Paris to confront the controversy variously called \nLatin Averroism and Heterodox Aristotelianism. After this second \nthree year stint, he was assigned to Naples. In 1274, on his way to \nthe Council of Lyon, he fell ill and died on March 7 in the \nCistercian abbey at Fossanova, which is perhaps twenty kilometers \nfrom Roccasecca.  \n\nLittle is known of Thomas's studies at Montecassino, but much is \nknown of the shape that the monastic schools had taken. They were one\nof the principal conduits of the liberal arts tradition which \nstretches back to Cassiodorus Senator in the 6th century. \nThe arts of the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic) and those of the \nquadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy) were fragments\npreserved against the ruinous loss of classical knowledge. They \nconstituted the secular education that complemented sacred doctrine \nas learned from the Bible. When Thomas transferred to Naples, his \neducation in the arts continued. Here it would have been impressed \nupon him that the liberal arts were no longer adequate categories of \nsecular learning: the new translations of Aristotle spelled the end \nof the liberal arts tradition, although the universities effected a \ntransition rather than a breach.  \n\nTaking Thomas's alma mater Paris as reference point, the Faculty of \nArts provided the point of entry to teen-aged boys. With the \nattainment of the Master of Arts at about the age of 20, one could go\non to study in a higher faculty, law, medicine or theology. The \ntheological program Thomas entered in Paris was a grueling one, with \nthe master's typically attained in the early thirties. Extensive and \nprogressively more intensive study of the scriptures, Old and New \nTestament, and of the summary of Christian doctrine called the \nSentences which was compiled by the twelfth century Bishop \nof Paris, Peter Lombard. These close textual studies were \ncomplemented by public disputations and the even more unruly \nquodlibetal questions. With the faculty modeled more or less on the \nguilds, the student served a long apprenticeship, established his \ncompetence in stages, and eventually after a public examination was \nnamed a master and then gave his inaugural lecture. \n\nThomas's writings by and large show their provenance in his teaching\nduties. His commentary on the Sentences put the seal on his\nstudent days and many of his very early commentaries on Scripture have\ncome down to us. But from the very beginning Thomas produces writings\nwhich would not have emerged from the usual tasks of the theological\nmaster. On Being and Essence and The Principles of\nNature (the latter a very useful summary for students of the\nprinciples that Aristotle develops in his Physics) date from\nhis first stay at Paris, and unlike his commentaries on\nBoethius' On the Trinity and\nDe hebdomadibus, are quite obviously philosophical works. \nSome of his disputed questions date from his first stint as regius \nmaster at Paris. When he returned to Italy his productivity \nincreased. He finished the Summa contra gentiles, wrote \nvarious disputed questions and began the Summa theologiae. \nIn 1268, at Rome, he began the work of commenting on Aristotle with \nOn the Soul, and during the next five or six years commented\non eleven more Aristotelian works (not all of these are\ncomplete). During this time he was caught up in magisterial duties of\nunusual scope and was writing such polemical works as On the\nEternity of the World and\nOn There Being Only One Intellect.  \n\nAt Naples, he was given the task of elevating the status of the\nDominican House of Studies. His writing continued until he had a\nmystical experience which made him think of all he had done as\n“mere straw.” At the time of his death in 1274 he was\nunder a cloud in Paris.  219 propositions were condemned in 1277 by a\ncommission appointed by the Bishop of Paris, among them some tenets of\nThomas. This was soon lifted, he was canonized and eventually was\ngiven the title of Common Doctor of the Church. But the subtle and\ndelicate assimilation of Aristotle that characterized his work in both\nphilosophy and theology did not survive his death, except in the\nDominican Order, and has experienced ups and downs ever since. \n\nMany contemporary philosophers are unsure how to read Thomas. He was \nin his primary and official profession a theologian. Nonetheless, we \nfind among his writings works anyone would recognize as philosophical\nand the dozen commentaries on Aristotle increasingly enjoy the \nrespect and interest of Aristotelian scholars. Even within \ntheological works as such there are extended discussions that are \neasily read as possessing a philosophical character. So his best \nknown work, the Summa theologiae, is often cited by \nphilosophers when Thomas's position on this or that issue is sought. \nHow can a theological work provide grist for philosophical mills? How\ndid Thomas distinguish between philosophy and theology?  \n\nSometimes Thomas puts the difference this way: “… the \nbeliever and the philosopher consider creatures differently. The \nphilosopher considers what belongs to their proper natures, while the\nbeliever considers only what is true of creatures insofar as they are\nrelated to God, for example, that they are created by God and are \nsubject to him, and the like.” (Summa contra gentiles,\nbk II, chap. 4) Since the philosopher too, according to Thomas, \nconsiders things as they relate to God, this statement does not put \nthe difference in a formal light. \n\nThe first and major formal difference between philosophy and theology\nis found in their principles, that is, starting points. The\npresuppositions of the philosopher, that to which his discussions and\narguments are ultimately driven back, are in the public domain, as it\nwere. They are things that everyone in principle can know upon\nreflection; they are where disagreement between us must come to an\nend. These principles are not themselves the products of deductive\nproof—which does not of course mean that they are immune to\nrational analysis and inquiry—and thus they are said to be known\nby themselves (per se, as opposed to per alia). This\nis proportionately true of each of the sciences, where the most common\nprinciples just alluded to are in the background and the proper\nprinciples or starting points of the particular science function\nregionally as the common principles do across the whole terrain of\nthought and being.  The fact that they are known per se does\nnot imply that they are easily known to just anyone who considers\nthem.  A good deal of experience of the world and inquiry, not to\nmention native intelligence, and the ability to avoid intellectual\ndistraction, may be required for anyone in particular to actually\napprehend their truth. \n\nBy contrast, the discourse of the theologian is ultimately driven \nback to starting points or principles that are held to be true on the\nbasis of faith, that is, the truths that are authoritatively conveyed\nby Revelation as revealed by God. Some believers reflect on these \ntruths and see other truths implied by them, spell out their \ninterrelations and defend them against the accusation of being \nnonsense. Theological discourse and inquiry look like any other and \nis, needless to say, governed by the common principles of thought and\nbeing; but it is characterized formally by the fact that its \narguments and analyses are taken to be truth-bearing only for one who\naccepts Scriptural revelation as true. \n\nThis provides a formal test for deciding whether a piece of discourse\nis philosophical or theological. If it relies only on truths anyone \ncan be expected upon sufficient reflection to know about the world, and if it \noffers to lead to new truths on the basis of such truths, and only on\nthat basis, then it is philosophical discourse. On the other hand, \ndiscourse whose cogency—not formal, but \nsubstantive—depends upon our accepting as true such claims as \nthat there are three persons in one divine nature, that our salvation\nwas effected by the sacrifice of Jesus, that Jesus is one person but \ntwo natures, one human, one divine, and the like, is theological \ndiscourse. Any appeal to an authoritative scriptural source as the \nnecessary nexus in an argument is thereby other than philosophical \ndiscourse. \n\nMore will be said of this contrast later, but this is the essential \ndifference Thomas recognizes between philosophy and theology. To \nconclude, consider a passage in which Thomas summarizes his\nposition. He is confronting an objection to there being any need for \ntheological discourse. Whatever can be the object of inquiry will \nqualify as a being of one sort or another; but the philosophical \ndisciplines seem to cover every kind of being, indeed there is even a\npart of it which Aristotle calls theology. So what need is there for \ndiscourse beyond philosophical discourse? \n\nFor Thomas theological discourse begins with what God has revealed \nabout Himself and His action in creating and redeeming the world.\nThe world is understood in that light. Philosophical discourse begins\nwith knowledge of the world.  If it speaks of God what it says is\nconditioned by what is known of the world. But even given the \ndistinction between the two, Aquinas suggests here that there are in \nfact elements of what God has revealed that are formally speaking \nphilosophical and subject to philosophical discussion—though \nrevealed they can be known and investigated without the precondition \nof faith. In other words, even something that is as a matter of fact revealed\nis subject to philosophical analysis, if religious faith is not \nnecessary to know it and accept it as true. So it may happen that \nconcerning certain subjects, as for example the nature of God, the \nnature of the human person, what is necessary for a human being to be\ngood and to fulfill his or her destiny, and so on, there can be both \na theological and a philosophical discussion of those subjects, \nproviding for a fruitful engagement between the theological and the \nphilosophical. For this reason, Thomas' theological works are \nvery often paradigms of that engagement between theological and \nphilosophical reflection, and provide some of his very best \nphilosophical reflection. \n\nIt will be observed that the formal distinction between philosophical\nand theological discourse leaves untouched what has often been the \nmark of one who is at once a believer and a philosopher. It is not \nsimply that he might on one occasion produce an argument that is \nphilosophical and at another time one that is theological; his \nreligious beliefs are clearly not put in escrow but are very much in \nevidence when he functions as a philosopher. Many of the questions \nthat can be raised philosophically are such that the believer already\nholds a position on the answers to them from his religious faith. How then can he be \nthought to be ready to follow the argument whither it listeth, as an \nobjector might put it? Furthermore, the inquiries in which the \nbeliever who philosophizes engages will often indicate his religious \ninterests.  \n\nWhen such observations turn into objections, perhaps into the \naccusation that a believer cannot be a proper philosopher, there is \noften an unexamined notion of what a proper philosopher looks like. \nThe proper philosopher may be thought to be someone—perhaps \nmerely some mind—without antecedents or history who first comes\nto consciousness posing a philosophical question the answer to which \nis pursued without prejudice. But of course no human being and thus \nno philosopher is pure reason, mind alone, without previous history \nas he embarks on the task of philosophizing. One has necessarily \nknocked about in the world for a long time before he signs up for \nPhilosophy 101. He has at hand or rattling around in his mind all \nkinds of ready responses to situations and questions. He very likely \nengaged in some kind of inquiry about whether or not to begin the \nformal study of philosophy in the first place. This may be \nacknowledged, but with the proviso that step one in the pursuit of \nphilosophy is to rid the mind of all such antecedents. They must be \nput in the dock, put in brackets, placed in doubt, regarded with \nsuspicion. Only after appropriate epistemological cleansing is the \nmind equipped to make its first warranted knowledge claim. Knowledge \nthus becomes a deliverance of philosophy, a product of \nphilosophizing. Outside of philosophy there is no knowledge. \n\nThe preceding paragraph has been meant to capture the salient note of\nmuch modern philosophy since Descartes. Philosophy is first of all a \nsearch for defensible knowledge claims, and for the method according \nto which it will be found. As opposed to what? \n\nAs opposed to the view of philosophy described in paragraph 2, Thomas\nunderstands philosophizing to depend upon antecedent knowledge, to \nproceed from it, and to be unintelligible unless, in its \nsophisticated modes, it can be traced back to the common truths known\nto all. But this tracing back will pass through very different \nterrains, depending on the upbringing, culture and other vagaries and\naccidents of a given person's experience. The \npre-philosophical—I refer to the formal study of \nphilosophy—outlook of the believer will be characterizable in a\ngiven way, a way suggested above. It is more difficult to \ncharacterize the pre-philosophical attitudes and beliefs out of which\nthe non-believer philosophizes. Let us imagine that he holds in a \nmore or less unexamined way that all events, including thinking, are \nphysical events. If as a philosopher he should happen take up the question\nof the immortality of the soul, he is going to regard with suspicion \nthose classical proofs which rely on an analysis of thinking as a \nnon-physical process. The Christian, on the other hand, will be \nwell-disposed towards efforts to prove the immortality of the human \nsoul and will accordingly approach descriptions of thinking as \nnon-physical sympathetically. He is unlikely to view with equanimity \nany claim that for human beings death is the utter end. \n\nThe importance of this is that a believer runs the risk of accepting\nbad proofs of the non-physical character of thinking and thus of the\nhuman soul. On the other hand, a committed physicalist may be too\nquick to accept a bad proof that thinking is just a physical process.\nHe may be just as likely to run the risk of accepting bad proofs of\nthe entirely physical character of thought as is the believer of the\nopposed claim. Such antecedent stances are often the reason why\nphilosophical agreement is so hard to reach. Does it make it\nimpossible? Do such considerations destroy any hope of philosophical\nobjectivity on either side? Surely not in principle. Believers and\nnon-believers should be able to agree on what counts as a good proof\nin a given area even if they expect different results from such a\nproof.  Thinking either is or is not merely a physical process and\nantecedent expectations do not settle the question, however much they\ninfluence the pursuit of that objective resolution. But the important\npoint is that antecedent dispositions and expectations are the common\ncondition of philosophers, believers and unbelievers alike. Of course\nbelievers hold that they have an advantage here, since the antecedents\nthat influence them are revealed truths, not just hearsay, received\nopinion, the zeitgeist, or prejudice.  In addition they may\nbe much more likely to be aware of and acknowledge those antecedents,\ninsofar as they are explicitly held and inquired into. \n\nGiven the distinction between philosophy and theology, one can then\ndistinguish between philosophical and theological sources and\ninfluences in Aquinas' work. As a philosopher Thomas is emphatically\nAristotelian. His interest in and perceptive understanding of the\nStagyrite is present from his earliest years and did not await the\nperiod toward the end of his life when he wrote his close textual\ncommentaries on Aristotle. When Thomas referred to Aristotle as the\nPhilosopher, he was not merely adopting a façon de\nparler of the time. He adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical\nobjects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime\nmover, his cosmology. He made his own Aristotle's account of sense\nperception and intellectual knowledge. His moral philosophy is closely\nbased on what he learned from Aristotle and in his commentary on\nthe Metaphysics he provides a cogent and coherent account of\nwhat is going on in those difficult pages.  Quite often deep insight\ninto Thomas' philosophical thought can be gained from a close\nattention to the ways in which he comments upon and interpretively\nclarifies difficult passages in Aristotle that can be otherwise very\nobscure.  \n\nBut to acknowledge the primary role of Aristotle in Thomas's philosophy is \nnot to deny other philosophical influences. Augustine is a massively \nimportant presence. Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Proclus were \nconduits through which he learned Neo-platonism. There is nothing \nmore obviously Aristotelian about Thomas than his assumption that \nthere is something to be learned from any author and not only mistakes to\nbe avoided. He definitely adopted many features from non-Aristotelian \nsources.  \n\nThis has led some to suggest that what is called Thomistic philosophy\nis an eclectic hodgepodge, not a set of coherent disciplines. Others,\nstruck by the prominence in Thomas of such Platonic notions as \nparticipation, have argued that his thought is fundamentally \nPlatonic, not Aristotelian. Still others argue that that there is a \nradically original Thomistic philosophy which cannot be characterized\nby anything it shares with earlier thinkers, particularly Aristotle. \n\nThe recognition that Thomas is fundamentally an Aristotelian is not \nequivalent to the claim that Aristotle is the only influence on him. \nIt is the claim that whatever Thomas takes on from other sources is \nheld to be compatible with what he already holds in common with \nAristotle. And, of course, to draw attention to the sources of \nThomas's philosophy is not to say that everything he holds \nphilosophically can be parsed back into historical antecedents, or \nthat he never disagrees with his sources, Aristotle in particular. \n\nThomas takes “philosophy” to be an umbrella term which \ncovers an ordered set of sciences. Philosophical thinking is \ncharacterized by its argumentative structure and a science is taken \nto be principally the discovery of the properties of kinds of things.\nBut thinking is sometimes theoretical and sometimes practical. The \npractical use of the mind has as its object the guidance of some \nactivity other than thinking—choosing in the case of moral \naction, some product in the case of art. The theoretical use of the \nmind has truth as its object.  It seeks not to change the world but to\nunderstand it. Like Aristotle, Thomas holds that there is a plurality\nof both theoretical and practical sciences. Ethics, economics and \npolitics are the practical sciences, while physics, mathematics and \nmetaphysics are the theoretical sciences.  \n\nThat is one way to lay out the various philosophical disciplines. But\nthere is another that has to do with the appropriate order in which \nthey should be studied. That order of learning is as follows: logic, \nmathematics, natural philosophy, moral philosophy, metaphysics. The \nprimacy of logic in this order stems from the fact that we have to know what \nknowledge is so we will recognize that we have met its demands in a \nparticular case. The study of mathematics comes early because little \nexperience of the world is required to master it. But when we turn to\nknowledge of the physical world, there is an ever increasing \ndependence upon a wide and deep experience of things. Moral \nphilosophy requires not only experience, but good upbringing and the \nordering of the passions. Metaphysics or speculative wisdom is the culminating \nand defining goal of philosophical inquiry: it is such knowledge as \nwe can achieve of the divine, the first cause of all else. \n\nThomas commented on two logical works of Aristotle: On\nInterpretation (incomplete) and Posterior Analytics. On\nmathematics, there are only glancing allusions in Thomas's writings.\nThomas describes logic as dealing with “second\nintentions,” that is, with formal relations that attach to\nconcepts expressive of the natures of existent things, first\nintentions.  The concepts come to be in us as a result of our\nengagement with the sensible world.  So it is important to stress that\nlogic concerns formal relations between concepts.  It is not concerned\nwith the sort of developmental and causal relations studied within the\nthe discipline of psychology. Thomas does not advocate a kind of\nproto-psychological account of logic as one might see in various 19th\ncentury accounts. \n\nThis means that logic rides piggy-back on direct \nknowledge of the world and thus incorporates the view that what is \nprimary in our knowledge is the things of which we first form \nconcepts. Mathematical entities are idealizations made by way of \nabstraction from our knowledge of sensible things. It is knowledge of\nsensible things which is primary and thus prior to the “order \nof learning” the philosophical sciences. \n\nThis epistemological primacy of knowledge of what we grasp by our \nsenses is the basis for the primacy of the sensible in our language. \nLanguage is expressive of knowledge, and thus what is first and most \neasily knowable by us will be what our language first expresses. That\nis the rule. It is interesting to see its application in the \ndevelopment of the philosophy of nature. \n\nThe concern of natural science is of course natural things, physical \nobjects, which may be described as “what come to be as the \nresult of a change and undergo change.” The first task of \nnatural philosophy, accordingly, is to define and analyze physical \nobjects.  \n\nThe first thing to notice about this is the assumption that we begin \nour study of the natural world not with the presumed ultimate \nalphabet with which macrocosmic things are spelled, but with a vague \nand comprehensive concept which encompasses whatever has come to be \nas the result of a change and undergoes change. The reader of Aquinas\nbecomes familiar with this assumption. Thomas learned it from the \nbeginning of Aristotle's Physics. \n\nNow what is to us plain and clear at first is rather confused masses,\nthe elements and principles of which become known to us later by\nanalysis. Thus we must advance from universals to particulars; it is a\nwhole that is more knowable to sense-perception, and a universal is a\nkind of whole, comprehending many things within it, like parts.  Much\nthe same thing happens in the relation of the name to the formula. A\nname, e.g. ‘Circle’, means vaguely a sort of whole: its\ndefinition analyses this into particulars. Similarly a child begins by\ncalling all men father and all women mother, but later on\ndistinguishes each of them. (Physics, 1, 1.) \n\nSo, for example, in giving the 1st way of proving the existence of a\ngod in the Summa Theologiae, Thomas will explicitly abide by\nthis order when he says that we should begin with what is most\nmanifest to us, namely, motion. \n\nThomas calls the movement from the more to the less general in a\nscience the “order of determination” or specification of\nthe subject matter. The first purchase on natural things is via\n“physical object” or “natural thing.” The\n“order of demonstration” involves finding the properties\nof things as known through this general concept. Then, specifying the\nsubject further, one seeks properties of things known through the less\ncommon concepts. For example, in plane geometry, one would begin with\nplane figure and discover what belongs to it as such. Then one would\nturn to, say, triangle and seek its properties, after which one would\ngo on to scalene and isosceles. So one will, having determined what is\ntrue of things insofar as they are physical objects, go on to seek the\nproperties of things which are physical objects of this kind or that,\nfor example, living and non-living bodies. \n\nThomas emphasizes those passages in the Aristotelian natural writings\nwhich speak of the order of determination, that is, of what \nconsiderations come first and are presupposed to those that come \nlater. In several places, Thomas takes great pains to array the \nAristotelian natural writings according to this Aristotelian \nprinciple, most notably perhaps at the outset of his commentary on \nSense and sensibilia. The Physics is the first step\nin the study of the natural world and exhibits the rule that what is \nfirst and most easily known by us are generalities. The language used\nto express knowledge of such generalities will have, as we shall \nemphasize, a long career in subsequent inquiries, both in natural \nphilosophy and beyond. What is sometimes thought of as a technical \nvocabulary, perhaps even as Aristotelian jargon, is seen by Thomas \nAquinas as exemplifying the rule that we name things as we know them \nand that we come to know more difficult things after the easier \nthings and extend the language used to speak of the easier, adjusting\nit to an ever expanding set of referents. \n\nThomas points out that the characteristic features of how we\nknow some subject should not in general be attributed to that subject\nas if elements of what we know of it.  So, although natural\nthings are first thought of and analyzed in the most general of terms,\nthere are not any general physical objects, only particular\nones. Thus, in seeking to discern what is true of anything that has\ncome to be as a result of a change and is subject to change until it\nceases to be, Aristotle had to begin with a particular example of\nchange, one so obvious that we would not be distracted by any\ndifficulties in accepting it as such. “A man becomes\nmusical.” Someone acquires a skill he did not previously\nhave. Thomas pores over the analysis Aristotle provides of this\ninstance of change and its product.  \n\nThe change may be expressed in three ways: \n\nThese are three different expressions of the same change and they all\nexhibit the form A becomes B. But change can also be expressed as From\nA, B comes to be. Could 1, 2 and 3 be restated in that second form? To\nsay “From the not-musical the musical comes to be” and\n“From a not-musical man the musical comes to be” seem\nacceptable alternatives, but “From a man musical comes to\nbe” would give us pause. Why? Unlike “A becomes B”\nthe form “From A, B comes to be” suggests that in order\nfor B to emerge, A must cease to be. This grounds the distinction\nbetween the grammatical subject of the sentence expressing a change\nand the subject of the change. The definition of the subject of the\nchange is “that to which the change is attributed and which\nsurvives the change.” The grammatical subjects of 2 and 3 do not\nexpress the subject of the change.  Only in 1 is the grammatical\nsubject expressive of the subject of the change. \n\nThis makes clear that the different expressions of the change involve\ntwo things other than the subject of the change, namely, the characteristics \nof the subject before (not-musical) and after (musical) the change. \nThese elements of the change get the names that stick from another \nexample, whittling wood. The term for wood in Greek is hyle \nand the term for shape, the external contours of a thing, is \nmorphe. In English, form, a synonym of shape, is used to \nexpress the characteristic that the subject acquires as the result of\nthe change, e.g. musical. The characterization of the subject prior \nto the change as not having the form is called privation. Using this \nlanguage as canonical, Aristotle speaks of the subject of the change \nas its hyle or matter, the character it gains as its \nmorphe or form, and its prior lack of the form as its \nprivation. Any change will involve these three elements: matter, form\nand privation. The product of a change involves two things: matter \nand form. \n\nChange takes place in the various categories of quality, quantity,\nplace, and so on.  In all cases the terminology of matter, form, and\nprivation comes to be used. So the terms applied in these different\ncategories will be used analogously. The terms bind together similar\nbut different kinds of change—a subject changing temperature is\nlike a subject changing place or size. \n\nThe analysis of change and the product of change begins with surface \nchanges. Some enduring thing changes place or quality or quantity. \nBut enduring things like men and trees and horses and the like have \nalso come into being and are destined some day to cease to be. Such \nthings are called substances. It is a given that there are substances\nand that they come to be and pass away. The question is: Can the \nanalysis of surface change be adjusted and applied to substantial \nchange? What would its subject be? The subject of substantial change \nis known on an analogy with the subject of incidental or surface \nchange. That is, if substances come to be as the result of a change, \nand if our analysis of change can apply, there must be a subject of \nthe change. The subject of a surface or incidental change is a \nsubstance. The subject of a substantial change cannot be a substance;\nif it were, the result would be a modification of that substance, \nthat is, an incidental change. But we are trying to understand how a \nsubstance itself comes into being as the result of a change. There \nmust be a matter or subject but it cannot be matter in the sense of a\nsubstance. In order to signal this, we can call the matter prime \nmatter, first matter. But it is important to recognize that this\nprime matter is not a substance, and does not exist apart from any \nparticular substance. It is always the matter of some substance that \nexists.  \n\nWhen the discussion moves on from what may be said of all physical\nobjects as such to an inquiry into living physical things, the\nanalyses build upon those already completed. Thus, “soul”\nwill be defined as the form of living bodies. The peculiar activities\nof living things will be grouped under headings like nutrition,\ngrowth, sense perception, knowing, and willing.  Since a living thing\nsometimes manifests an instance of such activities and sometimes does\nnot, they relate to it in the manner of the incidental forms of any\nphysical object. But they are not incidental in the way that we might\nthink of the shade of color of one's skin at any particular time, or\nthe particular height or weight of an individual, since as activities\nthe ability or power to engage in them proceeds from what the\nsubstance in question is. Thomas at times will call the powers through\nwhich they are achieved necessary accidents, using accident in a sense\ndifferent from more recent philosophy. While the abilities need not be\nexercised at any particular time or may be impeded from exercise by\nsome condition, the substance nonetheless possesses them in principle\nas long as it exists. \n\nThe form such a subject takes on as the result of the change cannot \nbe an incidental form like size or location or temperature. \nSubstances do not become or cease to be substances as a result of \nchanges in these incidental features. As the analysis of incidental \nchange makes clear, the substance previously existed without the form\nit acquires in the change and it could lose it and still be itself. \nIn a substantial change, the substance itself simply comes to be, or \nceases to be. The form in a substantial change must be that which \nmakes the substance to be what it is. Call it substantial \nform.  \n\nHere we see the semantic plasticity of the term 'matter'.  Initially\nin the analysis of change, 'matter' refers to the substance that takes\non or loses some incidental categorical modification of that\nsubstance.  Then the term is extended by analogy to cover whatever is\nthe subject of a change of substance.  Recognizing the analogical\nextension, Thomas avoids “reifying” what he identifies\nas principles of change and nature.  Although form and matter\nwill be “reduced” in a substantial change to the category\nof substance as principles of substance, they should not be thought of\nas substances or quasi-substances in their own right.  Socrates or\nBucephalus is a substance strictly speaking.  The forms and matter of\nSocrates and Bucephalus are not.  They are substantial principles\nwithout being substances or quasi-substances in their own right. \n\nSo the point to notice about this analysis is that substantial change is\nspoken of on an analogy with incidental change. The analysis of \nincidental change is presupposed and regulative. Moreover, the \nlanguage used to speak of the elements of incidental change are \nextended to substantial change and altered in meaning so as to avoid \nequivocation. The philosophical vocabulary arises out of analysis of \nwhat is most obvious to us and is then progressively extended to more\nand more things insofar as the later is made known by appeal to the \nprior. We see that matter and form apply in an analogous way\nto the various kinds of incidental change and then to substantial \nchange. The analysis of form and matter provides a rule for knowing \nand naming that will characterize Thomas's use of Latin in philosophy\nand in theology as well. \n\nFocusing specifically upon perception—seeing, feeling,\nhearing, and the like—how can we best analyze it? In continuity\nwith what has gone before, the questions are put in this form: How \nbest to analyze coming to see, coming to feel, coming to hear, and \nthe like? Seeing these on the analogy of change as already analyzed, \nwe look for a subject, a privation, and a form. The sensing subject \nis the animal, but the proximate subjects to which they are \nattributed are the powers of sight, touch, hearing, and the like. An \ninstance of seeing is describable as the power's moving from not \nseeing to seeing. Since the object of seeing is color, the change \nfrom not seeing to seeing issues in the power having the form of \ncolor. \n\nConsider an ordinary physical change, a substance acquiring a color.\nComing to see a color is not the same kind of physical change as a\nsubstance acquiring a color. To be sure, while there are physical\nchanges involved in sensation—the organs are altered in the way\nphysical bodies are—that is not the change involved in\nperception as such. Consider again that in feeling a warm or cold body\nthe hand's own temperature is altered by the contact. But feeling\ncannot be just that, since any two physical bodies that come into\ncontact undergo a similar alteration of temperature. But not all\nphysical bodies feel the temperature. Feeling the temperature,\nbecoming aware of it, is another sort of change, however much it\ninvolves a contemporaneous change in the organs of sense similar to\nordinary physical change. Having the color or temperature in this\nfurther sense is thus made known and named by reference to physical\nchange.  The fundamental difference between the two ways of acquiring\na form is this: in a physical change of color, the change produces a\nnew numerical instance of the color. In grasping or sensing a color, a\nnumerically new instance of color does not result.  And yet what was\npotentially visible becomes actually visible.  There is actuality in\nthe world where before there was only potentiality--an actuality of\nthe seen color, and an actuality of color not in the mode of existence\nthat color has in physical things. \n\nWe have here the basis for talk of immateriality in perception. If \nthe acquiring of a form by matter in physical change results in a new\ninstance of the form and this is not the case with perception, we can\nmake the point that acquiring the form in sensation is not identical \nto the acquiring of the form by matter in the primary sense.\nThus, we both want to speak of the subject of sensation on an analogy\nwith physical change and to distinguish the former from the \nlatter. This is done by speaking of the immaterial reception of a \nform. Nonetheless, the sense power is implemented in a physical \norgan, and thus matter for the change of form in sensation in an \nanalogous sense. Because in sensation the sense organ is physically \naltered and the matter of sensation in this analogous sense, we can \nsay that actual sensation is in some respects physical, and in \nanother not. \n\nIt is important to pay attention again to the order of learning and\nnaming, and what we are justified in saying at this point about the\nuse of the words involved in describing this change.  Specifically,\nthe use of ‘immaterial’ is introduced simply to mark the\ninadequacy of any analysis of sensation confined solely to the\nphysical terms that are fully adequate for analyzing ordinary physical\nchange that does not involve sensation. ‘Immaterial’ means\n‘not-material’. But the mere applicability of such a\nnegative term (what Aristotle calls a “negative infinite”\nterm) does not justify us in thinking we have discovered a new\nproperty that would be referred to by the term\n‘immateriality’—it does not pick out and name a\nparticular kind of property—any more than the mere applicability\nof ‘not-human’ justifies us in thinking we have discovered\na new particular kind of substance. \n\nNow, in his interpretation of Aristotle's De anima Thomas \ndefends a view that was as contested in his own time as it is almost \nan orphan in our own. Among the tenets of so-called Latin Averroism \nwas the view, first held by Averroes, that the move from perceptive \nacts to intellection is not one from a lower to a higher set of \ncapacities or faculties of the human soul. Aristotle contrasts \nintellection with perception, and argues that the former does not \nemploy a sense organ because it displays none of the characteristics \nof perception which does employ an organ. Thus insofar as sensation \ncan be said to be in some respects material and in others immaterial,\nintellection is said to be completely immaterial. But on the \nLatin-Averroistic view, Aristotle is not thus referring to another \ncapacity of the human soul, the intellect, but, rather, referring to \na separate entity thanks to whose action human beings engage in what \nwe call thinking. But the cause of this, the agent intellect, is not \na faculty of the soul. (Aristotle had distinguished at least two intellects, a \npossible and an agent.) The proof for incorruptibility which results from \nan activity that does not employ a corporeal organ is therefore a statement about the \nincorruptibility of this separate entity, not a basis for arguing \nthat each human soul is incorruptible because it has the capacity to \nperform incorporeal activities. The Latin-Averroists consequently \ndenied that Aristotle taught personal immortality. \n\nGiven this consequence, Thomas's adoption of the opposite\ninterpretation—viz. that the agent intellect is, like the\npossible intellect, a faculty of the human soul—may seem merely\nan interested desire to enlist Aristotle's support for a position in\nharmony with Christian belief. Thomas is frequently said to have\nbaptized Aristotle, which seems to mean that he fitted him to the\nProcrustean bed of Christian doctrine. Of course, the full Christian\nview is not simply that the soul survives death but that it will be\nreunited with body, and Thomas nowhere suggests that there is any\nintimation of this in Aristotle. Oddly enough, it is often friends of\nThomas who suggest that he merely used Aristotle and was not\nchiefly concerned with what Aristotle might actually have\nintended. \n\nHowever, this is an extraordinary approach to reading Thomas. It would\nbe less of an accusation to say that he got a passage wrong than that\nhe pretended it meant something he knew it did not. However, the\nimportant point is whether Thomas's reading is or is not supported by\nthe text. When he commented on the De anima, he seems not to\nbe concerned with the flare up in Paris over Latin Averroism. This is\nthe basis for dating the commentary in 1268, before Thomas returned to\nParis. The commentary, accordingly, cannot be read as though it were\nprompted by the controversy. Of course, some might still say that\nThomas had long term interests in taming Aristotle to behave in a\nChristian way. On the contrary, as it happens, during the second\nParisian period in the thick of the Latin-Averroist controversy,\nThomas wrote an opusculum dedicated to the question: what did\nAristotle actually teach? The work is called in the Latin, De\nunitate intellectus contra averroistas, On there being only\none intellect contra the Averroists. This little work is\nabsolutely essential for assessing the nature of Thomas's\nAristotelianism. He provides us with an extended textual analysis to\nshow that the rival interpretation cannot be sustained by the text and\nthat the only coherent reading of the De anima must view the\nagent and possible intellects as faculties of the human soul. His\ninterpretation may be right or wrong, but the matter must be decided\non the basis of textual interpretation, not vague remarks about\nThomas's intentions. \n\nPhilosophers nowadays will want to know how this account of substance\nplaces Aquinas on the question of the relation of body and soul with\nrespect to Dualism and Physicalism. Not easily. Aquinas maintains that\nthe soul is capable of existing apart from the living body after the\ndeath of the body, because the soul is incorruptible. This might\nsuggest that he is a kind of Substance Dualist, the soul being one\nsubstance and the body another, with the soul\n“interacting” as it were with the other substance, the\nbody. However this picture fails to recognize the Aristotelian terms\nof the account that Aquinas provides of soul and body.  Thomas knows\nand accepts Aristotle's assertion in De anima II.1 that it is\nas pointless to ask whether soul and body are one as it is to ask\nwhether the seal and the wax are one--they are. \n\nThe soul is indeed capable of existence apart from the body at death.\nThis incorruptibility results from the actualities of understanding\nand willing that are not the actualities of any bodily organ, but of\nthe human animal as such distinguished by the rational form. However,\nThomas merely concludes from this fact that the soul is a\n“particular thing” and thus a subsistent after the death\nof the body. He argues that what belongs to the notion of “this\nparticular thing” is only that it be a subsistent, and not that\nit be a substance complete in a nature.  A subsistent is something\nwith an operation of its own, existing either on its own or in another\nas an integral part, but not in the way either accidental or material\nforms exist in another.  Existing on its own is not\ndistinctive of substances alone. A chair is a particular thing, and\nthus a subsistent.  But on Aquinas' account it is not a substance; it\nis rather an accidental unity of other subsistents which may or may\nnot be substances. A hand has an operation distinctive of it as an\nintegral part of a living body, an operation different from the\noperation of the stomach; it is a particular thing and also a\nsubsistent. (Summa Theologiae Ia.75.2 ad1;\nalso Quaestiones Disputate de Anima 2.)  And yet being an\nintegral and functional part of a substance, it does not have the\ncomplete nature of a substance. \n\nA substance, on the other hand, is something that is both subsistent\nand complete in a nature—a nature being an intrinsic principle\nof movement and change in the subject.  A human soul is a constitutive\nelement of the nature of a human substance. It is the formal principle\nof a human substance. It is what is specified when we say what the\nsubstance is. But it is incomplete. What it is for a soul to be is to\nbe the form of some substance. In that sense it is a principle of a\nsubstance, ‘principle’ being a technical term that refers\nback to the first entry, arche, in Aristotle's philosophical\nlexicon in the Metaphysics, as well as Thomas' commentary on\nit, and Thomas' On the Principles of Nature. As the principle\nof a nature, its nature is to be the formal element of a complete\nsubstance. Consequently, it doesn't have its own nature and is not a\nsubstance in its own right, even if it is capable of subsisting apart\nfrom the living body. It is because it is naturally incomplete as\nsubsisting apart from the body that Thomas sees this state as\nunnatural for it, and an intimation of, but not an argument for, the\nresurrection of the body.  \n\nQuestion Ia.75 of the Summa Theologiae is the best place to\nlook for Thomas' discussion of the subsistent reality of the human\nsoul, although the Quaestiones Disputatae De Anima and the\ncommentary on Aristotle's De anima provide important\nsupplementary material to that discussion.  Thomas begins 75 by\npointing out that his concern is the concern of a theologian, and that\nthe theologian is concerned with human nature primarily in relation to\nthe soul. He is concerned with the body only in its relation to the\nsoul.  The body of the question is filled with philosophical argument,\nand yet its order and point is theological.  That theological order\nand point, however, can lead to certain philosophical distortions\nconcerning the soul if one isn't careful.  So Thomas is very\ncareful. \n\nConsidered as a substantial form of a material body, the soul exists\nin a living being as the substantial form of an animal.  Here it is\nimportant to clarify.  'Immaterial' can be said in two ways of forms.\nIn the first way, any form as such is immaterial because it\nis not a material principle.  It is distinguished as a principle of\nactuality in a being from the material principle which is a principle\nof potentiality and change in corporeal beings.  In that sense, any\nsubstantial form whatsoever will be immaterial, including the\nsubstantial form of an oak tree or the substantial form of a dog.  And\nso also is the substantial form of the human immaterial in\nthat sense.  Aquinas is explicit about this when he proves that the\nhuman soul is immaterial in Summa Theologiae Ia.75.5.  It is\nimmaterial in just the way in which any form whatsoever is immaterial.\nBut in the second way, 'immaterial' is said of subsistent\nforms—forms that subsist without matter like angels or spiritual\nsubstances in general.  \n\nIn 75.1 Thomas had argued against the ancient materialists, that the\nsoul is not a body; it is incorporeal.  In 75.2 he proved that the\nhuman soul is a subsistent because it has an activity that pertains to\nit without the use of a corporeal organ, namely, the activity of\nunderstanding in intellect.  But then immediately in 75.3 he proved\nthat the souls of other animals are not subsistent, because they do\nnot have an operation that does not employ a corporeal organ.  The\nsouls of other animals are incorporeal in the sense of 75.1, but they\nare not subsistent as in 75.2 In 75.4, Thomas proves that the soul is\nnot the man.  Socrates, the man, has vital activities that are the\nactivities of a living animal, like sensation, nutrition,\nreproduction, and so on, activities that are not distinctive\nactivities of the soul itself as intellect is in the human case.\nSince these are activities of Socrates and not activities of the soul,\nSocrates and the soul are not identical.  And so Socrates, if\nanything, is a living animal just like the other animals.  Tacitly\nthis leaves open the possibility that there might be an animal soul\nfor Socrates that is not identical to the intellectual soul, and as\nshown in 75.3 that this animal soul of Socrates would not be\nsubsistent.  This possibility of two souls in Socrates, an animal soul\nand an intellectual soul will only be excluded later in question 76.\nIn 75.5 Thomas proves that the human intellectual soul is immaterial\njust like the souls of other animals.  But in conjunction with the\nresult of 75.2, now we have a soul that is an immaterial subsistent,\nwhere in conjunction with 75.3 the souls of other animals are not\nimmaterial subsistents. \n\nIn 75.6, relying upon all that has gone before, Thomas argues that the\nhuman soul is a subsistent that is incorporeal, and thus does not\ncease to exist as a result of the death of the body.  This result\nshows the soul to be a subsistent form that can exist without out\nmatter.  And so it is now seen to be an immaterial subsistent in the\nsecond sense described above, not just the first sense.  Now\n'immaterial' characterizes its mode of existence, not just the\nnegative fact that it is immaterial like all other forms are\nimmaterial. \nSo the difference between the human intellectual soul and the souls of\nother animals is that while both are immaterial in the first sense,\nthe sense of not being material principles, the intellectual soul is\nan immaterial subsistent in the second sense while the souls of other\nanimals are not immaterial subsistents.  And it is the second sense of\n'immaterial' that gives us a key for understanding what Thomas means\nby a “material form,” particularly a material substantial\nform.  A material form is a form that is not an immaterial subsistent;\nit exists either as an accident in a corporeal subject or as a\nsubstantial form in a corporeal subject, and does not subsist.  So the\nsubstantial forms of bodies, particularly the souls of living bodies,\nare in general material forms with the exception of the intellectual\nsoul.  The souls of other animals are immaterial in the first sense\nand material with regard to the second sense, while the human soul is\nboth immaterial in the first sense and immaterial in the second\nsense. \n\nConfirmation of this distinction of senses of 'immaterial' comes when\nin the very last article of the question, 75.7, Thomas asked whether\nthe human intellectual soul is an angel.  In 75.6 Thomas used the\nresult of 75.5 and 75.2 to prove that the human soul is incorruptible,\nwhere something is corruptible if it can cease to exist through\ncorruption, that is, by the separation of form from matter as we see\nit in the death of living things.  The souls of other animals are\nnot directly generated and do not directly corrupt.\nIt is the living animal that corrupts.  But their souls can be said to\ncorrupt with the animal. (Quaestiones Disputatae De\nAnima 2) However, the human soul, because it is a subsistent\nimmaterial form, does not corrupt with the death of the human\nbeing.  So when all these results are put together the intellectual\nsoul is an incorporeal, immaterial, incorruptible subsistent, an\nimmaterial form in the second sense, which looks an awful lot like an\nangel, since angels are also incorporeal, immaterial, incorruptible\nsubsistents, and immaterial forms in the second sense.  This is the\npotentially distorting view of the theologian--to see the human\nintellectual soul as something like an angel, and we are reminded of\nShakespeare, “how like an angel.” Notice, however, that\nthe potential distortion is premised on the soundness of the\nphilosophical arguments that have been employed throughout the\nquestion by the theologian, driven by his primary interest in the\nsoul.   \n\nIn 75.7, Thomas argues that the intelletual soul is not of the same\nspecies as an angel, because it is a substantial form of an animal.\nAngels are complete in their natures as incorporeal, immaterial,\nincorruptible subsistent forms—they are thus substances properly\nspeaking.  But Thomas had insisted all along that the soul is\nincomplete in its nature, even as it is an incorporeal, immaterial,\nincorruptible subsistent form—it is not a substance properly\nspeaking.  Still, the soul can be called substance by\nanalogy, insofar as it is the formal principle of a substance. In\nEnglish it might be better to call it “substantial” rather\nthan “substance.” And in that regard, it cannot be\nconsidered as forming the basis for a kind of substance dualism in\nThomas. \n\nThe argument of 75.7 leads naturally to the subject of the next major\nquestion, Ia.76, on the union of soul and body.  We've already seen\nthat Thomas, following Aristotle, thinks asking questions about the\nunion of soul and body makes little sense for the philosopher.  But\nbecause of the potentially distorting view of the theologian, the\nlatter in a sense is forced to do so; the theologian has to ask\nphilosophical questions the philosopher need not ask, in order to\navoid a distorted view of the soul.  So in question 76 Thomas argues\nfor the complete unity of soul with body against various alternative\npositions to be found among his contemporary theological\ninterlocutors.  Thus question 75, proceeding as it does from the\ntheological perspective, gives rise to philosophical aporiae\nto be solved in question 76.  And just as it was the theologian's use\nof philosophical arguments in 75 that threatened a distorted view, it\nis the theologian's use of philosophical arguments in 76 that solves\nthe aporiae, and avoids the distortion.  Apart from anything\nelse Thomas does in the two questions, taken together they provide an\nexemplar of the use of philosophy within theology, not just to advance\ncertain theological positions but to assist the theologian in avoiding\nerror given the exclusivity of his theological perspective.  Thomas\nfulfills what he himself had said is one of the roles of philosophy\nwithin theology in the first question of the Summa.  \n\nThere are at least three important results of Ia.75-76 for thinking\nabout human nature.  In the first place, in 76.3-4 Thomas argues\nagainst the pluralist position on the Plurality of Substantial Forms.\nIt might be tempting to think of the human substantial form as a kind\nof layering of quasi substantial forms or as composed out of them.\nOne substantial form for the corporeality of the body, perhaps one to\naccount for the vegetative activities of the human being, yet another\nfor the animal activities, and then a final one for the intellectual\nactivities of the human being.  Recall that 75.4, in arguing that\nSocrates is not identical to the intellectual soul, tacitly leaves\nopen the possibility that Socrates might have a soul as principle for\nthese vital animal activities in addition to the intellectual soul\nwith which he is not identical.  However, Thomas decisively rejects\nthis plurality on the basis of the manifest unity of the human being\nin his acts.  If there were multiple substantial forms there would be\nno unity to being human—multiple substantial forms implies\nmultiple substances and multiple beings.  And yet the human being is\none, a single substantial unity manifested in his or her acts. Here\nThomas is relying upon the substantial unity that is obvious to the\nphilosopher to reject a kind of substance plurality, not just\nsoul-body dualism. \n\nIn particular he relies upon the fact that it is Socrates himself who\nengages in intellectual activity.  Again, in 75.4 he had rejected the\nview that Socrates is identical with his soul because Socrates engages\nin vital animal activities that do not belong to the soul as such.\nHowever, what he did not claim in 75.4 is that the activity of\nintellect that characterizes the soul is not one of Socrates\nactivities.  In fact, now in 76 he claims it is Socrates' activity.\nSocrates has vital activities that do not belong to the soul alone,\nand yet the activity that belongs to the soul alone, understanding, is\none of Socrates' activities.  But the soul is the principle of\nactivity in living things.  Thus the animal soul (and for similar\nreasons the vegetative soul) is identical in Socrates with the\nrational soul.  There is no plurality of substantial forms because of\nthe unity of Socrates' activities, including both animal activities\nand reason.  Neither is the human soul composed of any\nquasi-substantial forms.  This is the second striking result of 76.  Socrates and his soul,\nwhile not being identical, are subjects of the same activity—not\nsubjects of the same type of activity, but subjects of the\nsame token instance of an activity.  In 75, the soul as a\nsubsistent with its own operation of understanding was said to be the\nsubject of existence (esse) per se.  In the case of\nother animals it is the animal itself, the living substance, that is\nthe subject of the act of existence, and both soul and body have\nexistence through the substance.  Here in the human case, the soul is\nsaid to be the subject of the act of existence because it has its own\noperation.  Of course, Socrates is a substance with operations that\npertain to him, animal activities, but also the operation of\nintellect; it is Socrates who thinks in virtue of his intellect.  So\nhe too is the subject of the act of existence.  And yet the operation\nin virtue of which the soul is the subject of the act of existence,\nintellectual activity, is the operation in virtue of which Socrates is\nthe subject of the act of existence, again, not the same type of\noperation but the same token of operation.  So Socrates and his soul\nhave the same act of existence.  The principle for drawing this latter\nconclusion is that the operation of a subject follows from the act of\nexisting of that subject, as the actuality of a power follows from the\nactuality of the being.  (Quaestiones Disputatae De Anima\n2)  \n\nSo Socrates, as a living animal substance, is not identical to his\nsoul.  Anima mea non est ego Thomas asserts in his Commentary\non St. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians.  “I am not my\nsoul.” And yet Socrates and his soul share as subjects the very\nsame act of existence.  It is because Socrates' soul's act of\nexistence is Socrates' act of existence that the soul's intellectual\noperation is Socrates' intellectual operation.  It is also because of\nthis sharing in the act of existence, that the soul can be the\nsubstantial form of the living human animal.  Because the soul is a\nsubstantial form, it is not complete in its nature, and cannot be a\nspiritual substance like an angel, properly speaking.  Thus the soul\nreceives its act of existence as the soul of a human being,\nand cannot pre-exist the human being whose soul it is.  And yet, as\nThomas argued in 75.6, the soul is not subject to the corruptibility\nof the human being who is subject to death, and can thus survive the\ndeath of the human being. \n\nThe third significant result is that the soul is not composed from its\npowers as if a unified collection of them.  Thomas will often speak of\nthe “parts of the soul,” the appetitive part or the\nrational part, for example.  However, this way of speaking is for the\npurposes of classifying the powers.  It does not signal actual\nontological parts of the soul.  As the first act of a body, the soul\nis, like all act, ontologically simple, undivided, and un-composed.\nThe powers “flow” from the essence of the soul as\nnecessary accidents of the substance.  And Thomas tells us they are\nformally related to the soul as their principle in what Aristotle\ncalls in the Posterior Analytics the second mode of per\nse predication—that mode in which the subject of a\npredication enters into the definition of the predicate, were one to\ndefine the predicate.  From this it follows that if the human soul is\nincorruptible, the powers of Socrates that are powers of corporeal\norgans cease to exist with the death of Socrates.  And yet the power\nof intellect as a power of the soul without a corporeal organ remains\nincorruptible with the human soul.  However, Thomas is clear in\ndenying that only the intellect survives the death of the human; one\ncannot have a free floating incorruptible power in existence without\nthe subject of the power in existence.  The soul is other than the\npowers, and thus the intellectual power is incorruptible as a power of\nan incorruptible soul as its subject, and even the other powers remain\n“in” the soul as “in their principle.” \n\nAll of this emphasis upon the unity of the human being comes out\nclearly in Aquinas' understanding of the mode of human activity as\nacting knowingly and willingly. Such acting knowingly and willingly is\nexpressed as the rational activity of an animal, that is, as animal\nactivity distinguished formally as rational. Rationality is the\ndistinctive form that intelligence takes in human beings as\nanimals. Rationality involves the back and forth of argument moving\nfrom one thing known to another, and advancing in knowledge by such\nmovement. Thus, for Thomas, while angels and God can be said to be\nintelligent, they are not rational.   \n\nThis movement in understanding is necessary for human beings because\nas animals they only ever have a partial grasp of the natures of\nthings, insofar as their knowledge depends upon always incomplete and\npartial sensible experience of the world. But it is sense experience,\nas well as the self movement that springs from it, that places human\nbeings within the genus animal. So human understanding and willing is\nintrinsically bound up with the sensate activity of an animal; as a\nresult, rational is the form that it takes in that animal.\nReason does not cause eating as something separate from it, and as an\nefficient cause; on the contrary, human eating is not adequately\ndescribed formally unless it is described as rational eating. To fail\nto eat rationally is not a failure in its cause, but in the eating\nitself. And the human animal is not adequately described except as a\nrational animal, rational providing not another substance or\nexpression of a fissure between soul or mind and body, but the fully\nadequate description of the human substance. Reason does not\ndistinguish us from animals; it distinguishes us as animals.  So\naccording to Aquinas, while it is true that the activities of\nintellect and will are not the actualities of any physical organs,\nthey are nonetheless the activities of the living human animal. It is\nSocrates the animal who knows and wills, not his mind interacting with\nhis body. \n\nAnother consequence of this insistence on Aquinas' part is that it is\ninadequate and inaccurate to speak of activities we share in common\nwith other kinds of creatures. To be sure, there are descriptions that\napply equally to what we do and what other animals do, for example the\ndescription “eating” or the description\n“reproducing.” But these are generic descriptions that do\nnot adequately capture the human act as opposed to the act of a horse\nor dog, until the human acts are specified formally as rational. So\nthe goods that are the objects of human powers are not specified\nadequately by such generic descriptions as pursuing eating,\nreproducing, friendship, etc., as if human beings and other animals\npursue the same goods, only humans bring reason to bear upon those\nidentical type goods. \n\nAll of this might lead one to think then that, not being a dualist,\nAquinas must be a physicalist, there being only two broad possible\npositions. Now, the difficulties of providing an adequate account of\njust what Physicalism is are well known. But suppose we take a minimal\ncharacterization of Physicalism as involving the claim that there is\nsome privileged physical science or set of physical sciences, using\nthe term ‘physical’ merely nominally and sociologically as\nwe use it of certain sciences today, that ideally will provide a fully\nadequate account of all that exists and the fundamental\ncharacteristics of reality. Then Aquinas cannot be understood to be a\nphysicalist, since the result of his analysis of perception and\nthought was to say that these activities are “immaterial,”\nwhich was to say, not adequately captured by the kinds of physical\ndescriptions that do adequately account for much of the being and\nchange we observe in the world. There are actually many variations on\nDualism and Physicalism in play in recent philosophy. However, the\ndifficulty of placing Aquinas in the broad outlines of that setting\nought now to be clear.  And without an actual demonstration that\nAquinas' view is incoherent, one lasting contribution of his thought\nis to show that the supposed exclusive disjunction between Physicalism\nand Dualism is inadequate.  He poses to us a challenge to think more\nbroadly and deeply about human existence than such an easy dichotomy\nallows. \n\nTo be immortal is not to be subject to death.  Living corporeal\nsubstances are subject to death through the corruption of their\nsubstantial unity—not so much the separation of soul from body,\nbut the dissolution of the soul as the substantial form of the body.\nThis dissolution of the soul is brought about by destructive natural\ncauses acting upon the living body.  Living things themselves have\nvarious capacities to preserve themselves in existence against the\nravages of the natural world around them; that is, in part, what it is\nfor them to live—to sustain their existence in and through their\nown natural activities.  And yet nature teaches us that corruptible\nthings inevitably corrupt. \n\nWhat of Socrates?  Socrates is an animal.  Thomas is unambiguous about\nthis fact in 75.4 when he argues that Socrates is not identical to his\nsoul because of his animal acts.  But, if Socrates is an animal he\nshould be as subject to corruption as is any corporeal substance, and\nas subject to death as any animal.  Here it is important to make an\ninitial distinction.  As we've seen, living things act to preserve\ntheir existence through their vital activities, and succeed in doing\nso for a time, even if they eventually succumb to the reaper.  So we\nmay say they are naturally subject to death because of their composed\ncorporeal natures.  And yet, it does not follow that they must corrupt\nand die; by and large their lives consist in preventing the corruption\nto which they are subject.  This fact alone shows that there are\ncauses with the power to fend off death, even if not to fend it off\npermanently.  However, it is then at least possible that some other\ncause, a cause with much greater power than the natural causes of\nliving things possess, could fend off death for them without end and\npreserve them alive without end.  The obvious candidate for this cause\nis God by miraculous intervention; if living things have limited power\nto fend off their own deaths, presumably God has unlimited power to do\nso for them.  So what is corruptible by nature may not in fact\ncorrupt.  While animals are naturally subject to death, they could be\nsupernaturally immortal.   \n\nSo also even if human beings are naturally subject to death, it may\nwell be within the power of God to keep them from dying by a\npreternatural gift.  This condition of having been given a\npreternatural gift preserving them from death would be the condition\nof the first human beings in the biblical account of Eden, the\npreternatural gift lost by Original Sin through which death entered\ninto the world, however else one understands those data of revelation.\nBut philosophically we can say no more of them than that human beings\nare naturally subject to death but need not die. \n\nHowever, the world we live in is not an Edenic paradise into which\ndeath has not entered.  Living things die.  Human beings die.\nSocrates died.  On the other hand, according to Thomas, Socrates' soul\nis incorruptible where the souls of other animals are not.  It is not\neven naturally subject to death by corruption.  Is there a possibility\nfor immortality, particularly personal immortality, here in the\nincorruptibility of Socrates' soul? \n\nOne might be tempted to say yes.  One might say that in the first\nplace the incorruptible soul of Socrates looks like a person in the\ncurrent sense of that term.  It is a thinking or conscious thing,\nsince it is clearly a thing at least in the sense of a subsistent, and\nit has the power of intellect, even if it has no other conscious\ncognitive powers of the animal for which it formally was a soul.  What\n“we” mean by person is a “thinking or conscious\nthing.” So Socrates' soul is a person.  What person?  Well\nSocrates was a person in that very sense as well, although he had more\nconscious cognitive capacities than does his soul after death.  It\nseems incongruous to suggest that we have two persons—Socrates\nand Socrates' soul.  After all that would seem to strike against the\nunity Thomas was at pains to maintain.  While Socrates was alive, were\nthese two persons present?  No.  There is but one person, and it is\nSocrates.  But then upon the death of Socrates, what happens?  Does\nthe person who is Socrates cease to exist, and a new person that is\nSocrates' soul come to exist? But, it seems much easier and simpler to\nsay that upon Socrates' death the person that was Socrates survives as\nSocrates's soul.  Before death Socrates was composed of a soul and a\nbody.  After death he is composed simply of a soul.  If we hold that\nposition then, because of the incorruptibility of the soul, while the\nanimal that Socrates was dies, the soul that Socrates becomes\nsurvives, and thus Socrates himself is immortal, and not subject to\ndeath, not subject to death even by nature as the animal is.  Socrates\nis simply immortal.  On this proposed account when Thomas wrote\n“anima mea non est ego,” he was merely speaking\nof this life.  He should then have added “anima mea ero\nego,” “I will be my soul.” \n\nHowever as an interpretation of Thomas this approach will suffer\nseveral severe difficulties.  First, on its own terms it is hard to\navoid the conclusion that before Socrates' death, there are two\npersons present.  The argument of 75.2 was not that the intellectual\nsoul becomes a particular thing and subsistent upon the death\nof the human being.  It was that the intellectual soul as such is a\nparticular thing and subsistent, and that includes while it is the\nsoul of a living thing.  So if we are going to take the recent\nminimalist account of person that the term expresses in this proposed\ninterpretation, a thinking or conscious thing, then we have\nthe person that is the particular and subsistent thing that is the\nsoul before the death of Socrates.  But Thomas thinks Socrates thinks,\nand is thus a thinking thing.  So we also have the person Socrates.\nIs the person that is the soul identical to the person that is\nSocrates?  It seems not, given the argument of 75.4 that Socrates is\nnot identical to his soul.  So this interpretation suggests that even\nif after death there is only one person, Socrates, before death there\nare two persons, Socrates and Socrates' soul.  In the second place, this interpretation explicitly relies upon an\nequivocation on the term 'person'.  Thomas accepts from Boethius the\ndefinition of a person as  an individual substance of a rational\nnature.  (Summa Theologiae IIIa.2.2) But Thomas insists\nthat the soul is incomplete in its nature.  It does not have\na nature, but is one of the principles of a corporeal nature along\nwith matter.  It can only be said to “have” a nature\nimproperly and by analogy.  And when we do so speak, what is meant is\nthat its nature is to be the substantial form of an animal.  Again,\nthat is why it is not an angel.  So strictly speaking, the human soul,\neven as a subsistent, is not and cannot be a person, unless one\nequivocates on the term, and in so doing abandons the Philosophy of\nNature and Metaphysics within which Thomas thinks. \n\nIn the third place, this interpretation would make hay of Thomas'\nargument in 75.4 that Socrates is not identical to his soul.  There\nThomas relied upon the vital activities of Socrates to make that\nargument--Socrates has vital activities that the soul does not possess\nas a subject or subsistent.  But they are Socrates' activities as\nagent just as much as is the operation of intellect.  The powers that\nthose activities manifest are powers of Socrates in just the way the\npower of intellect is.  Again this resolves into the\n“nature” of the soul as substantial form.  All of\nSocrates' powers “flow from” the soul as their formal\nprinciple, even as one of them, intellect, also has the soul as its\nsubject along with Socrates.  So if one were to ask which of the\npowers might be thought to be not quite Socrates' power in the full\nsense, one ought to opt for the intellect, not the vital powers of the\nliving body, since it seems that intellect belongs to something other\nthat Socrates and is at best shared with Socrates.  But then why would\nSocrates become identical to the subject in virtue of a power that is\nnot quite his, rather than cease to be with the powers that are\nproperly his?  Such questions, and the answers one might give to them,\nare again senseless if we situate what Thomas thinks back in what he\nwrote.  The reason that intellectual power is no less Socrates' power\nthan it is the soul's is because the act of being of Socrates is the\nact of being of his soul.  It is a mistake to think that because\nSocrates is not identical to his soul, his soul forms some other being\nwith which he would share some power. Again, this has to do with the\nsoul being his substantial form. \n\nIn the fourth place, this interpretation would suggest, in Thomas'\nterms, that the body with its powers is per accidens related\nto Socrates' being.  If Socrates is a substance, and the body\nis per accidens to his being, then the body is per\naccidens to his substance.  In which case he is not a corporeal\nsubstance or animal at all, even in this life.  The interpretation\nseems to return to giving the appearance that the intellectual soul is\na kind of angel, only now adding that this angel is Socrates for a\ntime associated with bodily powers.  But recall Thomas' rejection of\nthe Plurality of Substantial Forms position.  His own account of the\nsoul is that the animal powers of the soul are as much powers of the\nhuman soul as is the intellectual power—they are all powers in\nthe second mode of per se predication.  In that respect they\nare all alike, and the human soul is thus per se the\nsubstantial form of a living body, not per accidens, and the\nperson Socrates is that living body.  When that living body ceases to\nexist through death, so also does the person who is Socratres.\n“Anima mea non est ego” simply.   \n\nFinally, Thomas clearly understands and accepts the implications of\nhis view that Socrates is the living animal, namely, that the\ncontinued existence of the human soul after death is not sufficient\nfor the continued existence of the human person.  If the living animal\nno longer exists after death, then neither does Socrates.  If the\nliving animal is not immortal, then neither is Socrates.  Consider\nthese objections that Thomas himself considers.  There is no\nresurrection of the body; only the souls of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob\nlive after death.  Thomas writes in response that the soul of Abraham\nis not Abraham, and the life of Abraham's soul is not sufficient for\nthe life of Abraham.  The whole composite of Abraham's soul and body\nmust live for Abraham to live. Thus if only Abraham's soul lives after\ndeath, Abraham does not.  (Summa Theologiae 75.1 ad 2)\nSimilarly when in the Commentary on First Corinthians Thomas writes\n“anima mea non est ego,” it is precisely to\nemphasize the importance of the resurrection of the body for human\nsalvation.  He writes that “hence allowing that the soul gains\nsalvation in another life, neither I nor any other human being\ndoes,” (unde licet anima consequatur salutem in alia vita,\nnon tamen ego vel quilibet homo.) because “anima mea non\nest ego.” The importance of the theological doctrine of Christ's\nResurrection is that it affirms that it is I who am ultimately saved\nthrough my resurrection from the dead, which involves me coming to\nexist when my body rises from the dead. \n\nOf course Thomas does not think that the resurrection of the body is\ndemonstrable in philosophy.  For him it is a revealed truth, not one\nof the praeambula fidei.  Nonetheless he thinks it is\nrationally fitting for God to bring it about, since otherwise there\nwould be these very odd beings in existence for all time, incorporeal,\nimmaterial, incorruptible subsistent forms the “nature” of\nwhich is to be the substantial forms of living bodies.  Earlier we saw\nhow Thomas' use of philosophical analysis helped to avoid the\npotentially distorting view of the theologian upon the nature of the\nsoul.  Here, we see how a revealed truth helps the philosopher avoid\nan equally distorting philosophical account of the soul and personal\nidentity that would skew the philosophical books toward a personal\nhuman immortality without having to live as a human animal. \n\nWhen Aristotle rejected the Platonic Ideas or Forms, accepting some of\nthe arguments against them that Plato himself had devised in the\nParmenides, he did not thereby reject the notion that the \ntelos of philosophical enquiry is a wisdom which turns on what man \ncan know of God. The magnificent panorama provided at the beginning \nof the Metaphysics as gloss on the claim that all men \nnaturally desire to know rises to and culminates in the conception of\nwisdom as knowledge of all things in their ultimate or first causes.  \n\nFor much of the twentieth century, Aristotelian studies had been \nconducted under the influence of Werner Jaeger's (1934) evolutionary \nhypothesis. On this view, Aristotle began as an ardent Platonist for \nwhom the really real lay beyond sensible reality. With maturity, \nhowever, came the sober Macedonian empiricism which trained its \nattention on the things of this world and eschewed all efforts to \ntranscend it. As for the Metaphysics, Jaeger saw it as an \namalgam of both theories. The passage just alluded to at the \nbeginning of the work is ascribed to the Platonic phase. Other \npassages have a far more modest understanding of the range and point \nof a science over and above natural philosophy and mathematics. \nPlatonice loquendo, there are entities which exist \nseparately from sensible things and they constitute the object of the\nhigher science. The more sober view finds a role for a science beyond\nnatural philosophy and mathematics, but it will deal with things \nthose particular sciences leave unattended, e.g. defense of the first\nprinciple of reasoning. But these tasks do not call for, and do not \nimply, a range of beings over and above sensible things. \n\nJaeger (1934) found both these conceptions of metaphysics juxtaposed\nin a crucial passage of Book Six. \n\nJaeger invites us to see here a monument to a lost hope and an \nabiding reluctance to bid it a definitive farewell. Aristotle \nmentions the possibility of an immovable substance, something \nexisting apart from the natural realm. Without such a separate \nsubstance, natural philosophy will be first philosophy. If there is \nsuch a substance, it will be a kind of being different from material \nbeing. The science that studies it will bear on a certain kind of \nbeing, immovable substance, immaterial being, not on being as being. \nIt will be a special, not a universal, science. Jaeger sees Aristotle\nseeking to glue on to the special science the tasks that belong to a \nuniversal science, to make a theology into an ontology.  \n\nJaeger's hypothesis dominated interpretations of the \nMetaphysics until very recently. Giovanni Reale's book (1961)\nhad to await English translation before it could have any impact in\nEnglish circles of interpretation. By that time, people were turning\nfrom Jaeger's account and toward a more direct reading of\nAristotle. When we reconsider Thomas as a commentator on\nthe Metaphysics, it becomes clear that his reading is in\nstark opposition to Jaeger's claims. \n\nBut let us first lay out Thomas's view of metaphysics. His question \nis Aristotle's: is there any science beyond natural science and \nmathematics? If to be and to be material are identical, then the \nscience of being as being will be identical with the science of \nmaterial being. That is what Aristotle rejects in the passage just \nquoted. It is in the course of doing natural philosophy that one \ngains certain knowledge that not everything that is is material. At \nthe end of the Physics, Aristotle argues from the nature of \nmoved movers that they require a first unmoved mover. If successful, \nthis proof establishes that there is a first mover of all moved \nmovers which is not itself material. Furthermore, the discussion of \nintellect in On the Soul III, to which we alluded in the \npreceding paragraph, points beyond the material world. If the \nactivity of intellect provides a basis for saying that, while the \nhuman soul is the substantial form of the body, it can exist apart \nfrom the body, that is, survive death, it is an immaterial existent. \nThe Prime Mover and the immortal souls of human beings entail that to\nbe and to be material are not identical. Since these are acquisitions\nat the limit of natural philosophy, they represent possible objects \nof inquiry in their own right. This is pre-eminently the case with \nthe Prime Mover. It seems inevitable that there should be a \ndiscipline whose principal aim is to know more about the divine. How \ncan it be described? \n\nThomas discusses early the way theoretical sciences are distinguished\nfrom one another in the course of his exposition of the tractate of\nBoethius On the Trinity. The text speaks of three kinds of\ntheoretical science, physics, mathematics and theology, and Thomas\ninvokes the methodology of the Posterior\nAnalytics. A scientia is constituted by a demonstrative\nsyllogism. From a formal point of view, a conclusion follows\nnecessarily from the premises in a well-formed syllogism. Still the\nconclusion may state a merely contingent truth. What is needed in a\ndemonstrative syllogism is not just the necessity of the consequence\nbut a necessary consequent, and this requires that the premises\nexpress necessary truths. That which is necessary cannot be otherwise\nthan as it is; it cannot change.  Science thus requires that it bear\non immobile things. There is another requirement of the object of\nspeculative or theoretical knowledge which stems from\nintellection. The activity of the mind, as has been mentioned, is not\na material event; it is immaterial. Since it is the mind that knows,\nscience is a mode of its knowing, and will share its nature. Thomas\nthus states two essential characteristics of the object of\nspeculation, the speculabile: it must be removed both from\nmatter and from motion. If that is the case then insofar as there are\nformally different ways in which\nspeculabilia can be removed from matter and motion, there \nwill be formally different speculative sciences. \n\nBy this analysis, Thomas has provided the necessary background for \nunderstanding the text of Boethius but also more importantly that of \nAristotle as it is developed in the chapter from which Werner Jaeger \nquoted in order to display the failure of the Aristotelian project. \n“Now we must not fail to notice the nature of the essence and \nof its formula, for, without this, inquiry is but idle. Of things \ndefined, i.e. of essences, some are like snub, and some like concave.\nAnd these differ because snub is bound up with matter (for what is \nsnub is a concave nose), while concavity is independent of \nperceptible matter.” (1025a28–32) The objects of natural \nphilosophy are defined like ‘snub’ and the objects of \nmathematics like ‘concave’. This makes it clear that the \nway in which natural things are separated from sensible matter is the\nway in which the definition common to many things abstracts from the \nsingular characteristics of each. But it is the matter as singular \nthat is the principle of change in things, so the common definition \nhas the requisite necessity for science. This or that man comes to \nbe, but what-it-is-to-be-a-man does not come to be or pass away. \n\nMathematical things, on the analogy of ‘concave’, do not \nhave sensible matter in their definitions. Lines, points, numbers, \ntriangles—these do not have sensible qualities whether stated \nuniversally or singularly. The fact that we define mathematicals \nwithout sensible matter does not commit us to the view that \nmathematicals actually exist apart from sensible matter. \n\nIn the commentary on Boethius to which reference has been made, \nThomas has early on recalled another fundamental aspect of \nAristotle's thought. The objects of thought are either simple or \ncomplex, where complex means that one thing is affirmed or denied of \nanother. Knowledge of simples is expressed in a definition, that of \nthe complex in a proposition. Thinking of human nature without \nthinking of singular characters of this man or that is a matter of \ndefinition, not of assertion, as if one were denying that human \nnature is found in singular matter. So too defining mathematicals \nwithout sensible matter is not tantamount to the judgment that \nmathematicals exist apart from sensible matter. These are both \ninstances of abstraction, where abstraction means to think apart what\ndoes not exist apart. Thus it is that the question of metaphysics \nturns on what Thomas calls separatio. To separate differs \nfrom abstraction in this that separation is expressed in a negative \njudgment, an asserted proposition: this is not that, that \nthis exists apart from that. The relevant \nseparation for metaphysics is the negative judgment that to be and to\nbe material are not the same. That is, there are things which exist \napart from matter and motion—not just are defined without, but \nexist without matter and motion. \n\nWhat then is the subject of metaphysics? “Subject” here \nmeans the subject of the conclusion of the demonstrative syllogism. \nThe discussion of definition in effect bore on the middle terms of \ndemonstrative syllogisms. The suggestion is that formally different \nmodes of defining, with respect to removal from matter and motion, \nground the formal difference between types of theoretical science. \nThe subject of a demonstration in natural philosophy is defined \nwithout singular but with common or universal sensible matter; the \nsubject of a mathematical demonstration is defined without any \nsensible matter. How can the subject of metaphysics be expressed? The\npossibility of the science depends on our knowing that some things \nexist apart from matter and motion. Mathematics does not presuppose \nthe separate existence of its objects; metaphysics does. Why not then\nsay that metaphysics deals with things separated from matter and \nmotion, that is with a particular kind of being? But that is not \nthe subject ever assigned to this effort by Aristotle. The \nmethodological reasons can be found in chapter 17 of Book Seven of \nthe Metaphysics: the subject of a science must always be a \ncomplex. That is why the subject of this discipline is being \nas being. \n\nWhy should we say that, in our desire to learn more about separate \nsubstances, we should take as our subject all the things that are? \nThe short answer is this: in order to be a theology, metaphysics must\nfirst be an ontology. Separate substance, divine being, is not \ndirectly accessible for our inspection or study. We come upon our \nfirst secure knowledge of a god in the proof of the Prime Mover. \nTantalizingly, once seen as a necessary requirement for there being \nany moved movers, the Prime Mover does not become a thematic object \nof inquiry in natural philosophy. One obvious reason for this is that\nsuch an entity is not an instance of the things which fall under the \nscope of the science. Knowledge of it comes about obliquely and \nindirectly. The same restriction is operative when the philosopher \nturns his culminating attention to a deity. How can he know more \nabout the first cause of things? If the Prime Mover is known through \nmoved movers as his effects, any further knowledge of him must be \nthrough his effects. It is by describing the effect as widely as \npossible that one seeks to come to a knowledge of the first cause \nunrestricted by the characteristics of mobile things. That \ncharacterization is being as being. The subject of metaphysics is \nbeing in all its amplitude in order to acquire a knowledge of the \ncause of being that will be correspondingly unbounded. \n\nEarlier we indicated the difference between philosophy and theology \nin the writings of St. Thomas. That distinction takes theology to \nmean discourse that takes its rise from the revealed truths of the \nBible. But there is also a theology which constitutes the defining \ntelos of philosophical inquiry. In the following passage, Thomas \ncontrasts the two theologies in a way which throws light on what was \nsaid in the preceding paragraph.  \n\nPhilosophical theology is not some science distinct from metaphysics;\nit is simply the name that can be given to metaphysics because it \nappeals to a god as the cause of its subject. This may make it seem \nthat knowledge of a god is merely a bonus, a tangential consideration; \non the contrary, it is the chief aim of the science. But the divine \ncan only be known indirectly, through its effects. For this reason, \nmetaphysics can be viewed as an extended effort to examine substance \nin order to come to knowledge of the first cause. And given the \nprinciple that we name things as we know them (ST Ia.13.1), this can \nbe regarded as a prolonged effort to develop the language with which \nwe speak of a god.  \n\nThomas says that the truth of the proposition a god exists is\nknowable in itself, because the predicate is included in the essence \nof the subject. But it is not knowable to us, because the essence of \na god is unknowable to us. He also says that the essence of a god is \nexistence, that such a being is ipsum esse subsistens, and yet that we\ncannot know this essence. How is any of this coherent? Mustn't one \nknow what one is talking about to deny anything of it, in particular \nto deny that it is knowable to us? How can Thomas simultaneously assert \nwhat the essence of a god is and deny that we know it?  \n\nIn order to understand why his claims about the existence and essence\nof a god are not incoherent, we need to place them within the context\nof Aristotle's Posterior Analytics. According to Aristotle,\none mode of per se predication, the first, is that in which\nthe predicate of the proposition is included within the definition of\nthe subject.  We've already seen the second, where the subject is\nincluded in the defintion of the predicate, the mode appropriate to\nthe powers of a subject. So in the first mode, if one immediately knew\nthe essential definition of the subject, one would immediately know\nthat a particular proposition is per se true simply by\nknowing that its predicate is included within that essential\ndefinition. Any proposition in which the predicate is included in the\nessential definition of the subject is knowable in itself. For\ninstance, Thomas thinks that anyone who knows the language will know\nthe truth of a proposition like a whole consists of the sum of its\nparts. Because the terms are related in this fashion and so\nfundamental in the language, no special knowledge is necessary to\ngrasp its truth. Such a proposition is thus knowable in itself but\nalso to us. \n\nHowever, clearly this account leaves open the possibility of subjects\nin which the essential definition is either unknown or even\nunknowable. For instance, if we suppose that H2O is the essential\ndefinition of water, we have to recognize that there will be many who\nwill not know it. It will not be immediately “known to\nus,” but require learning. No doubt we can still refer to water\nin statements about it because the term ‘water’ has a\nnominal definition, clear-potable-odorless etc., used by the community\nto refer to what is in fact H2O. So that water is H2O will be\nknowable in itself, even if unknowable to us, until we engage in\nChemistry. Consider the mind. Clearly we use the term 'mind'\nmeaningfully in any number of sentences. But perhaps, as Colin McGinn\nhas argued, the actual nature of mind is incomprehensible to limited\nminds such as ours. In that case it might be knowable in itself, and\nyet strictly unknowable to us. Thus the distinction between what is\nknowable in itself and what is knowable to us is not incoherent. \n\nWhat of the claims that the essence of a god is not just unknown to\nus, but unknowable to us, that the essence of a god is His existence,\nand that it is ipsum esse subsistens? Don't these remain\njointly inconsistent and thus incoherent, even if the underlying\ndistinction is not? No. In claiming that the essence of a god is not\nknowable to us, Thomas is talking about its accessibility to\nphilosophical inquiry. The human mind of itself is proportioned to\nknowing material things. It can only know immaterial things insofar as\ncausal arguments can be made to posit the existence of such things as\nnecessary to the explanation of material things—causes that are\nonly appealed to when one has excluded the possibility of a material\nexplanation of the phenomenon. But we've already seen that to claim\nthat something is immaterial is not to know any property of it, much\nless its essence. Still, it remains available to Thomas to claim that\nwhile the knowledge of the essence of a god is unknowable to\nphilosophy, it is known to us by Revelation. Indeed, he appeals to\nGod's revelation to Moses on Sinai to establish the claim that God's\nessence is ipsum esse subsistens—that is to say, the\nbeing who reveals Himself to Moses identifies Himself as what the\nphilosophers are looking for but cannot find in its essence.  And\nChristians believe that God further discloses Himself in the\nIncarnation of Christ and the Gospel narratives as a Trinity of\nPersons in Unity of Substance. (Summa theologiae Ia.31.1 ad\n4) Here, in knowing the essence of God as trinitarian we have another\nexample, like the Resurrection, of something that can only be known by\nfaith in God's Revelation. It is not something that can be known by\nboth Revelation and Philosophy. So the essence of God is knowable in\nitself, and also to the learned. But the learned are not the\nphilosophers. Rather they are all those who know it by faith in God's\nrevelation. \n\nSo, can the existence of God be philosophically demonstrated? If God's\nessence is His existence, and His essence remains in principle\nphilosophically unknowable to us, how could it be demonstrated? In\nfact, Aquinas claims that it can be demonstrated that there\nis a god, and that there is only one god. That God's\nessence remains in principle philosophically unknowable to us is the\nbasis for Aquinas' denial that the existence of God can be\ndemonstrated a priori. And any reliance upon knowledge of the\nessence that is only known to us by faith would by that fact cease to\nbe properly philosophical. However, we have seen that Aquinas relies\nupon the distinction between nominal definitions of terms and\nessential definitions of the subjects referred to by those terms. To\ndemonstrate the existence of a god one may use nominal definitions\nthat appeal to a god as the cause of various phenomena. This is to\nargue a posteriori. The appeal to these nominal definitions\nforms the basis for Aquinas' Five Ways (Summa Theologiae,\nIa.2.3) all of which end with some claim about how the term\n‘god’ is used. \n\nAgain, some will claim that Aquinas isn't really interested in proving\nthe existence of God in these Five Ways. After all, he already knows\nthe existence of God by faith, and he is writing a theological work\nfor beginners. What need is there of proving the existence of\nsomething he already knows exists? The Ways are very sketchy, and\ndon't even necessarily conclude to a single being, much less God or\nthe Christian God. In addition, Aquinas claims that God's essence is\nhis existence and that we cannot know His essence, so we cannot know\nHis existence. Aquinas must really intend the Five Ways as less than\nproofs; they are more like incomplete propaedeutic considerations for\nthinking adequately about God in Sacred Theology.  In effect, Aquinas\ndoesn't think philosophy can in fact demonstrate the existence of\nGod. \n\nBut as elsewhere these claims are ambiguous and suffer at the hands of\nThomas' own texts. In the first place, the objection that he already\nknows by faith that God exists has some merit in it, if we understand\nit as directed at a reading of Thomas that would have him attempting a\nfoundational enterprise of grounding religious faith in what is\nrationally demonstrable by Philosophy. But that reading is\nanachronistic, and does not attend to the context of the Summa\nTheologiae. There is no reason to think that Thomas thinks the\nproofs are necessary for the rationality of religious faith. They are\npart of the enterprise of showing that Sacra Doctrina meets\nthe condition of a science as described by Aristotle in the\nPosterior Analytics, which he had argued in the first\nquestion of the Summa, an issue that is different from the\nquestion of the broad rationality of religious faith. \n\nIn addition, the objections end up denying what Aquinas writes\nimmediately before the Five Ways—that the existence of a god is\n“demonstrable.” (Summa Theologiae Ia.2.2) And his\nintroduction of the Five Ways begins by saying that the existence of a\ngod can be “proved” in Five Ways. To counter the objection\nthat he must mean something informal here by “demonstrate”\nand “prove,” one need only recognize the explicit use of\nAristotle's Posterior Analytics to sort through the\nquestion. He cites Aristotle's distinction between demonstrating the\nexistence of some subject, and going on to demonstrate properties of\nthat subject by appeal to the essence of the subject as cause of those\nproperties. The first kind of demonstration is called\ndemonstration quia, the second demonstration propter\nquid. In order to have any science at all, the subject matter\nmust exist. So demonstration quia must precede\ndemonstration propter quid. If you want to have a science of\nunicorns, you have to show me that there is at least one unicorn to be\nstudied. There is no science of what does not exist. So there are two\ndemonstrative stages in any science, the demonstration of the\nexistence of the subject (quia), and the demonstration of the\nproperties of the subject through its essence (propter\nquid). Aquinas' denial that the essence of God can be known\nphilosophically is a denial that one can have propter quid\nscientific understanding of a god through philosophy. It is not a\ndenial that there can be demonstration quia of the existence\nof a god. There is no reason to deny that Thomas thinks the Five Ways\nare proofs or demonstrations in the most robust sense, namely that\nwhich he appeals to as set out by Aristotle in the Posterior\nAnalytics. \n\nNotice however the back and forth between the use of ‘God’\nas a proper name and the use of ‘god’ as a common\nnoun. One source of the ambiguity in the objections comes about\nbecause it is claimed that Aquinas does not think one can demonstrate\nthe existence of God. But in terms of the Posterior Analytics\none cannot demonstrate the existence of anything under a proper\nname. One can point at Socrates, and say “see, Socrates is\nalive.” One cannot do that with God. In addition, one cannot\ngive a formal argument for Socrates existence using\n‘Socrates’. One can only demonstrate in the relevant sense\nusing common nouns, since such nouns are the only ones that have\ndefinitions, either nominal or essential. So strictly speaking it is\ntrue that Thomas doesn't think one can demonstrate the existence\nof God in the Five Ways.  He recognizes the difference\nbetween ‘God’ used as a proper noun, and ‘god’\nused as a common noun. (Summa Theologiae Ia.13.9) The\nambiguity is pronounced in Latin which lacks the indefinite article\n‘a’, where in English we can disambiguate between\n‘God’ and ‘a god’. The situation is\nexacerbated by translations that simply translate ‘deus’\nin the Ways as ‘God’ in English. In the Five Ways, he does\nnot use ‘god’as a proper name, but as a common noun having\nfive different nominal definitions. So each of the ways concludes that\nthere is “a god.” Thus, it is also true that the Five Ways\ndo not as such prove that there is only one god. It is for that reason\nthat Thomas himself thinks one must actually argue additionally that a\ngod must be utterly unique, and thus that there can be only one, which\nhe does several questions after the Five Ways (Summa\nTheologiae Ia.11). Of course, once the utter uniqueness of a god\nhas been shown, one can begin to use “God” as a proper\nname to refer to that utterly unique being, as he subsequently argues\nin Summa Theologiae Ia.13 does happen. \n\nIt is the utter uniqueness and singularity of a god that undermines\nthe objection that whatever the philosophical arguments terminate in,\nit is not the god of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, a god who is\nonly known by faith. That is simply to deny Thomas' claim that the god\nJews, Christians, and Muslims believe in can be known, but only\npartially by philosophical analysis. If the demonstrations work, as\nThomas thinks they do, what other god would the Jews, Christians, and\nMuslims believe in? There is no other god.  Given God's revelation, He\nmust be identified with the utterly unique being the philosopher's\nargument terminates in. \n\nFinally, the sketchy character of the Ways reflects the fact that they\nare directed at beginning students. However the audience of beginners\nthat Thomas has in mind are not beginners in Philosophy.  They are\nbeginners in Sacra Doctrina. As we have seen, in the medieval\neducational setting such beginners would be thoroughly steeped in the\nphilosophical disciplines before ever being allowed to study Sacra\nDoctrina. So Aquinas could expect his readers to know the much\nmore extensive and complete arguments he was gesturing at with the\nFive Ways, arguments to be found in detail in other figures like\nAristotle, Avicenna, and so on, as well as in other works of his own,\nthe Summa Contra Gentiles for example. In short, even if the\nFive Ways are judged to be unsound demonstrations, a judgment that\nrequires close analysis and examination of the filled out arguments,\nthere is no reason to suggest that Thomas took them any less seriously\nas demonstrations or proofs in the fullest sense. \n\nNow, even though there can be no demonstration propter quid\nof God's essence or nature, this does not mean that philosophical\ntheology is left with a bare knowledge of the existence of God, and\nnothing more. The second stage of science will go on, but it will go\non in a mode deeply indebted to Pseudo-Dionysius and Neoplatonism with\nthe approach often called the “via negativa.” Instead of\narguing positively from the essence of God to His properties, one will\nargue from God's effects, particularly the perfections of creatures\nthat do not of necessity involve material embodiment, to the\naffirmation that God possesses these perfections. However, recognizing\nthat the way in which God possesses these perfections must be\ndifferent from the way in which creatures possess them, one must deny\nthat God has them in the creaturely mode. Instead He must possess them\nin a “super eminent” fashion that we cannot\ncomprehend. So, while on the basis of effect to cause arguments we can\nsay that God is just, wise, good, perfect, and so on, we do not know\nwhat it is for God to be just, wise, good, and perfect. We end up\ndenying of God the creaturely mode of these perfections. In this way\nGod is approached negatively by denying things of Him rather than by\ndirectly knowing what God is. This account relies heavily upon the use\nof analogous names in talking about God and creatures.  \n\nAristotle spoke of “things said in many ways,” a notable\ninstance of which is “being.” One of the difficulties with\nassigning being, or being qua being as the subject of a science is\nthat a subject must be univocally common to the things that fall under\nit. But ‘being’ is not univocal, as it has a plurality of\nmeanings. Aristotle solved this problem with his account of\n“things said in many ways,” by observing that while they\nhave many meanings, these form an ordered set with one of the meanings\nas primary and regulative. Substance is being in the primary sense,\nwhich is why the science of being as being is effectively a science of\nsubstance. Thomas's term for such names is analogy:\n‘being’ is an analogous term and its primary analogate is\nsubstance.  \n\nIn the crucial middle books of the Metaphysics—Seven\nand Eight—we have an analysis of substance which takes off from\nmaterial substance, which is a compound of matter and form, and\narrives at a notion of substance as form alone. This definition does\nnot fit material substance, of course, but it is devised in order to\nbe able to apply the term substance to the immaterial things whose\nexistence has been established in natural philosophy. This extension\nof names, whose natural habitat is sensible things, to God is another\ninstance of analogous naming for Thomas. Names common to God and\ncreatures bring out another feature of our knowing. If we ask what the\nprimary analogate of names common to God and creatures is, the answer\nis: the meaning of the term as it applies to creatures. The word must\nbe refined before it can be applied to God and this means the\nformation of an extended meaning which leans on the primary meaning\nfor its intelligibility. \n\nConsider the example of ‘wise’. Both men and God are said\nto be wise. What can we mean when we say that God is wise? Not the\nsame thing as when we say that Socrates is wise. Socrates became wise\nand wisdom is a trait which with age and forgetfulness he could lose.\nThus to be Socrates and to be wise are not the same thing. But in the\ncase of God, ‘wise’ does not signify some incidental\nproperty He might or might not have. This is captured by noting that\nwhile we say God is wise, we also say he is wisdom. This\nsuffices to indicate the way in which the meaning of the term as\napplied to God involves negating features of its meaning as it applies\nto men. \n\nIf God is thus named secondarily by the common name, so that the\ncreature is primarily named by it, nonetheless God's wisdom is the\ncause and source of human wisdom. Ontologically, God is primary and\nthe creature secondary. Names analogously common to God and creature\nthus underscore the way in which what comes to be known first for us\nis not first in reality, and what is first in reality is not first in\nour knowledge. \n\nIt is evident that material substances exist contingently. They come\ninto being and they pass out of being. While they exist, their\nexisting is not what they are. Thomas accepts from Boethius that it is\nself-evident that what a thing is and its existing differ\n(diversum est esse et id quod est). Material things depend\nupon causes to exist, both to become and to be. There is no need to\ndwell on this except insofar as it provides a springboard to speak of\nimmaterial substance. Only in God is it the case that what he is and\nhis existing are identical: God is His own existence. The phrase\nThomas uses to express this is ipsum esse subsistens. Of\ncourse this is paradoxical. Existence is the actuality of a substance,\nnot itself something subsistent. This is true with material\nsubstances. But when we ask what we mean by saying that God exists, we\nhave to negate aspects of material existence in order to avoid\nspeaking of Him as if he were a contingent being.  \n\nThe problem that Thomas now faces is how to speak of the immaterial\nsubstances which are less than God although superior to material\nsubstances, that is, angels. For a material thing to exist is for its\nform actually to inhere in its matter. But what is it for a pure form\nto exist? Since immaterial substances less than God are dependent on\nthe divine causality in order to exist, existing cannot be what they\nare of their essence. In short, in angels too there is a distinction\nof essence and existence. Thomas notes that a created separate\nsubstance is what it is and not another thing: that is, it has the\nperfection it has, but not unlimited perfection. It is a being of a\nkind, not being as such. Gabriel is perfect as to his nature, but he\nlacks the perfection of being Raphael or Michael. Form thus operates\nas a restriction on existence as such. In God alone is there\nunrestricted existence; He is existence, ipsum esse\nsubsistens. Here we have an argument for the fact that God's\nessence is his existence, because His essence is not a\nrestriction of esse to a finite expression or character. And\nyet it remains true that while we know the fact, we do not know the\nwhy of the fact because the knowledge of God's essence remains unknown\nto us. \n\nThomas' Moral Doctrine is primarily eudaimonistic and virtue based.\nHuman beings always act for an end that is conceived of as good.  A\ndesired good provides the motive for initiating and completing some\nact.  Action begins in desire and ends in satisfaction or joy in\ncompletion— the achievement or acquisition of the good\napprehended and desired.  Properly human action proceeds from and is\nunder the control of intellect and will.  While human beings have many\nappetites informed by sense cognition of the world, they also have\nrational appetite that is informed by an intellectual apprehension of\nthe world and the goods within it appropriate to human flourishing.\nErrors of apprehension are certainly possible, and yet a human action\nalways originates in the apprehension of some apparent good by\nintellect and the desire for it by the will informed by the\napprehension.  Will is rational appetite.  Actions are judged to be\ngood or bad in relation to real human goods for which they are either\nconducive (good) or detrimental (bad).  Given the complexity of human\nlife and the goods appropriate to it, it may well happen that a\nparticular action may be judged to be good in many ways, and yet also\nbad in others.  For one to have acted well simply is for one to have\ndone something that is good in every respect.  There is one single\nultimate human good that provides an ordering of all other human goods\nas partial in relation to it, namely, happiness or better in the\nLatin beatitudo. \n\nWhen Aristotle sought to isolate the human good, he employed the \nso-called function argument. If one knows what a carpenter is or does\nhe has the criteria for recognizing a good carpenter. So too with \nbank-tellers, golfers, brain surgeons and locksmiths. If then man as \nsuch has a function, we will have a basis for deciding whether \nsomeone is a good human being. But what could this function be? Just \nas we do not appraise carpenters on the basis of their golf game or \ngolfers on the basis of their being able to pick locks, we will not \nwant to appraise the human agent on an incidental basis. So too we do\nnot appraise the carpenter in terms of his weight, the condition of \nhis lungs, or his taste buds. No more would we appraise a human being \non the basis of activities similar to those engaged in by non-human \nanimals. The activity that sets the human agent apart from all others\nis rational activity. The human agent acts knowingly-willingly. \nIf this is the human function, the human being who performs it well \nwill be a good person and be happy. \n\nThomas argues that there is one single end for all human beings, and\nthat it is happiness.  However, that is a formal description of the\nend, leaving open the material specification of just what that\nhappiness is for a human being.  Thomas distinguishes in the Summa\nTheologiae between the imperfect happiness of this life and the\nperfect happiness of the next life in beatitude or union with God. And\non the basis of this distinction some will argue that Aquinas\nultimately finds Aristotle's function argument unsatisfying, insofar\nas the result of the function argument is supposed to be the claim\nthat happiness consists in a complete life lived in accord with reason\nand virtue. And here again it will be claimed that Aquinas in some\nsense rejects the fundamentals of the Aristotelian account. Insofar as\nhe describes the life in accord with reason and virtue in this life as\nimperfect, he must be suggesting that it is in some sense faulty, not\ntrue or real happiness. Real happiness is something other.  \n\nBut such an interpretation fails on a number of counts. In the first\nplace it misunderstands Aquinas' use of ‘imperfect’ which\ndoes not mean faulty or false. It can mean not\nas great by comparison, as in the claim that human beings are\nimperfect with regard to the angels. This claim is not meant to\nsuggest that human beings are faulty or false angels; it simply means\nthat their perfection is not as great in the scale of being as that of\nthe angels. It can also mean incomplete in the constitution of some\noverall good. So the pursuit of some limited good, say education, is\nimperfect because not the complete human good, even though it is\npartially constitutive of the human good. But it is certainly not a\nfaulty or false human good. \n\nIn the second place, such a claim about Aquinas has to confront his\nown understanding of Aristotle. Aquinas claims that Aristotle\nunderstood that a complete life in accord with reason and virtue in\nthis life is incomplete or imperfect happiness. (See his commentary on\nthe Nichomachean Ethics, Book 1, lect. 16,\n#200–202). Indeed, Aristotle himself says that perfect happiness\nis to be associated with the divine. (Nichomachean Ethics,\n1099b9–13) Thus Aquinas does not claim for himself the\ndistinction between imperfect and perfect happiness, but attributes it\nto Aristotle. And so his use of it in the Summa Theologiae\ncannot be taken to be a rejection of the analysis Aristotle provides\nof the formal characteristics of happiness. \n\nObviously, one may fault Thomas for his understanding of Aristotle.\nBut the claim that he misinterprets Aristotle is no argument that he\nrejects Aristotle. In fact, his interpretation of Aristotle on\nimperfect and perfect happiness embodies the thesis he expresses in\nthe Summa Theologiae that we saw above. The philosophers are\ncapable of grasping some of the things that are constitutive of or\nnecessary for perfect happiness in beatitude. Revelation concerning\neven those matters they can grasp is necessary, because what they have\ngrasped takes a long time, is very difficult, and may be filled with\nerrors. God in his mercy makes these things known in revelation in\norder that perfect happiness may be attained. And yet, Thomas never\nabandons the fundamental affirmation of the human capacity to\nunderstand apart from revelation the nature of happiness in formal\nterms and what constitutes its imperfect material status in this life,\neven as its perfect embodiment in the next remains unattainable to\nphilosophy without the resources of faith.  \n\nMany have come to this point, pulse quickened by the possibilities of\nthe function-argument, only to be gripped with doubt at this final\napplication of it. Rational activity seems too unmanageable a\ndescription to permit a function-analysis of it. Of course Aristotle\nagrees, having made the point himself. Rational activity is said in\nmany ways or, as Thomas would put it, it is an analogous term. It\ncovers an ordered set of instances. There is the activity of reason as\nsuch, there is the activity of reason in its directive or practical\ncapacity, and there are bodily movements and the like which are\nrational insofar as rational provides the adequate formal description\nof them. If the virtue of a function is to perform it well, the\nanalogy of “rational activity” makes clear that there is a\nplurality of virtues. Moral virtues are habits of appetite brought\nabout by the direction of reason. Temperance is to seek pleasure\nrationally; courage is to react to the threat of harm rationally. The\nvirtues of practical intellect are art and prudence; the virtues of\ntheoretical intellect are insight, science and wisdom. \n\nAll this and much more enters into Thomas's moral teaching. Thomas\nwill distinguish acts of a human from human acts, the former being\nactivities truly found in human agents, but also found in other\nnon-human agents too. For example, the act of a human might be as\nimportant as the beating of his heart or or as trivial as the nervous\ntapping of his fingers. The human act is one which proceeds from and\nis under the control of reason and will. Since the human act by\ndefinition is the pursuit of a known good, the question arises as to\nthe relationship between the objects of the myriad acts that humans\nperform. Is there some over-all good sought by human agents? Is there\nan ultimate end of human action? \n\nIn commenting on chapter two of Book One of the Nicomachean\nEthics where Aristotle argues for there being an ultimate end,\nThomas points out that the argument is actually a series of\nreductiones ad absurdum. That is, the denial of an ultimate \nend of human action reduces to the claim that there is no end to \nhuman seeking at all, that it is pointless. This analysis has not \ngotten the attention it deserves: the implication is that it is \nself-evident that there is an ultimate end which is why denials of it\nmust flounder in incoherence. The argument for an ultimate end that \nThomas puts forth in the Summa Theologiae is somewhat \ndifferent. Any action aims at some good. A particular good by \ndefinition shares in and is not identical with goodness itself. What \nbinds together all the acts that humans perform is the overarching \ngoodness they seek in this, that, and the other thing. That over \narching goodness, what Thomas calls the ratio bonitatis, is \nthe ultimate end. It follows that anything a human agent does is done\nfor the sake of the ultimate end. \n\nThis dissatisfies because we feel we are owed a richer account of\ngoodness. After all, human agents differ insofar as they have\ndifferent notions of what goodness is. Fame, wealth, pleasure, power,\nand so on seem to function as the dominant purpose of different\npersons. Thomas could scarcely overlook this, let alone deny it. Can\nhis earlier position on the unity of the ultimate end still stand?\nThe fact that there are false or inadequate identifications of\ngoodness does not mean that there is not a true and adequate account\nof what is perfecting or fulfilling of human agents. Everyone acts on\nthe supposition that what he does will contribute to his overall good;\none's overall good is the ultimate reason for doing anything.  But not\neverything one does under this aegis actually contributes to one's\noverall good. Thus in one sense there is one and the same ultimate end\nfor every human agent—the integral human good—and there\nare correct and mistaken notions of what actually constitutes this\nintegral good. \n\nThis may seem like an empty claim, but it provides a basis on which to\nproceed. If indeed every human agent acts for the sake of his overall\ngood, the discussion can turn to whether or not what he here and now\npursues, or his general theory of what constitutes the overall good,\ncan withstand scrutiny. It is not necessary to persuade anyone that he\nought to pursue the ultimate end in the sense of his overall\ngood. What else would he pursue? But if one is persuaded that what he\npursues does not contribute to his overall good, he already has\nreasons for changing his ways. Thomas' broad account of virtues as excellences or perfections of\nthe various human powers formally echoes Aristotle, both with regard\nto the nature of a virtue and many specific virtues.  Virtues are\ndeveloped habits of powers disposing agents to good actions.  Because\nhuman actions are those acts that are subject to the rule of human\nreason and will, the human virtues reside in the various powers that\nare subject to the rule of reason and will.  As developed dispositions\nthey stand as intermediate states between the powers simply and the\nfull blown exercises of those powers.  A virtue is a kind of mean\nbetween excess and defect in the exercise of a power.  For example,\nwith regard to eating a temperate person eats what is appropriate to\nhim or her, pursuing neither too much which would lead to gluttony nor\nto little which would lead to starvation. However, it is a mistake to think that Thomas simply repeats\nAristotle.  In the first place, he discusses a wide array of both\nparticular virtues and vices never discussed by Aristotle.  More\nimportantly the theological setting of his work results in a number of\ndistinctions concerning the virtues that pertain to human life and\nhappiness.  Thomas first distinguishes a twofold happiness for human\nbeings.  One is the sort of happiness that is achievable by a human\nagent in this life through the exercise of the powers he or she is\nendowed with by nature.  He says this is a happiness that is\n“proportionate” to human nature.  It may well include the\nsort of contemplation of the nature of divinity the philosophers\naspire to.  However, Thomas adds that there is “another”\nhappiness that cannot be achieved simply by the exercise of the human\npowers without divine supernatural assistance. (Summa\ntheologiae Ia-IIae.62.1) This is a happiness not to be found\nperfectly in this life, but only in the next.  It\nis beatitudo or blessedness strictly speaking.  It consists\nin the intellectual vision of God and all things “in” God.\nWhile the kind of contemplation of God the philosophers aspire to in\nthis life consists in knowing God through His effects and the ways in\nwhich they represent Him as cause, this beatitudo of the next\nlife Thomas describes as a participation in the life of divinity\nitself as the essence of God Himself is united by the “light of\nglory” to the intellect of the human being (Summa\ntheologiae Ia.12), a union with God that results in the\nexperience of ultimate and final joy or delight of the\nwill. (Summa theologiae IIa-IIae.11.3-4) However, even though\nthis beatitudo is brought about supernaturally by the power\nof God, it is not utterly foreign to human nature.  In effect, the\nsupernatural power of God elevates or expands the powers of intellect\nand will to a kind of completion beyond themselves and yet not foreign\nto them.  So this distinction of a “twofold happiness”\nshould not be thought of as involving two fundamentally distinct goals\nor ends of human life.  The second supernatural happiness is seen as a\nkind of surpassing perfection of the first. This distinction of a twofold happiness in human life leads to a\ndistinction between the natural virtues and the theological virtues.\nNatural virtues are virtues that pertain to the happiness of this life\nthat is “proportionate” to human nature.  Theological\nvirtues pertain to the beatitudo that is not proportionate to\nhuman nature, the supernatural good of life with God.  Natural virtues\nare divided into moral virtues and intellectual virtues.  The\nintellectual virtues perfect the intellect and confer an aptness for\nthe good work of the intellect which is the apprehension of truth.\nThe moral virtues are the habits that perfect the various powers\nconcerned with human appetites, including rational appetite,\nconferring upon them an aptness for the right use of those\nappetites. The cardinal natural virtues are Prudence, Justice, Courage, and\nTemperance.  Prudence is an intellectual virtue since it bears upon\nthe goal of truth in the good ordering of action.  In addition,\nbecause there are two specific powers of the generic sensitive\nappetite, the concupiscent and the irascible, there are two cardinal\nvirtues that pertain to them.  The concupiscent appetite inclines one\ntoward what is suitable and away from what is harmful to human bodily\nlife.  Temperance is the cardinal virtue that pertains to it.  The\nirascible appetite inclines one toward resisting those things that\nattack human bodily life.  Courage is the cardinal virtue that\npertains to it.  Finally, Justice is a virtue of the rational appetite\nor will.  These virtues are called “cardinal” both because\nof their specific importance, but also as general headings under which\nthe wide array of particular virtues are classed.  Temperance and\nCourage are ordered toward and perfect the good of the individual as\nsuch, while Justice is ordered toward and perfects the good of others\nin relation to the individual. The theological virtues are Faith, Hope, and Love.  They bear upon\neternal beatitude and are simply infused by God's gift of grace.  They\ncannot be acquired by human effort.  However, as noted above the\n“second” supernatural happiness is not foreign to the\nfirst natural happiness, but a kind of surpassing perfection of it.\nSo along with the infusion of the theological virtues, Thomas holds\nthat natural virtues are infused along with them.  Thus there is a\ndistinction between “infused natural virtues” and\n“acquired natural virtues.” As infused, the natural\nvirtues cannot be acquired by human effort, although they may be\nstrengthened by it.  Acquired natural virtues, on the other hand, are\nthe corresponding virtues that can be acquired by human effort without\nthe gift of divine grace.  While Thomas acknowledges that these\nacquired natural virtues can in principle be developed by human effort\nwithout grace, he thinks that their actual acquisition by human effort\nis very difficult due to the influence of sin. \nIn addition, the infused natural virtues spring from Charity as its\neffects, and thus bear upon its object, which is the love of God and\nthe love of neighbor in God.  A primary example for Thomas\nis Misericordia which is the virtue that pertains to\nsuffering with others and acting to alleviate their suffering.  It\nlooks like Justice because it bears upon the good of another.  And yet\nit is different from Justice because it springs from the natural\nfriendship that all human beings bear to one another, and requires\nthat one take upon oneself the sufferings of other human beings.\nThomas explicitly but unconvincingly claims that Aristotle recognized\nit.  And yet in the Summa Theologiae he says that it is an\neffect of Charity.  In that case there is an acquired form of it and\nan infused form of it.  As infused, it is informed by the love of God\nand the love of neighbor in God which is beatitude. \nThe infused natural virtues differ in important respects\nfrom the corresponding acquired virtues because as infused they point\ntoward the supernatural end, and the mean in acquired virtue is fixed\nby human reason while the mean in the infused virtue is according to\ndivine rule.  Thomas gives as an example the difference between\nacquired and infused Temperance.  Acquired temperance is a mean\ninclining a human being to eat enough food to sustain his or her\nhealth and not harm the body.  Infused temperance is a mean inclining\nthe human being through abstinence to castigate and subject the\nbody. \nEven one mortal or grave sin destroys both Charity and all the infused\nmoral virtues that proceed from it, while leaving Hope and Faith as\nlifeless habits that are no longer virtues.  On the other hand, a\nsingle sin, whether venial or mortal, does not destroy the acquired\nnatural virtues. \nCharity, as we've seen, is the love of God and neighbor in God. It\nresides in the will. Hope is the desire for the difficult but\nattainable good of eternal happiness or beatitude.  It too resides in\nthe will.  Faith is intellectual assent to revealed supernatural\ntruths that are not evident in themselves or through demonstration\nfrom truths evident in themselves. So it resides in the intellect. It\nis divided into believing that there is a god and other truths\npertaining to that truth, believing God, and believing\n“in” God.  The distinction between the last two is subtle.\nIt is one thing to say you believe me.  It is a different thing to say\nyou believe in me.  The latter connotes the relation of your intellect\nto the will's desire to direct yourself to me in love. Thus believing\nin God goes well beyond believing that there is a god.  It suggests\nthe other theological virtues of Charity and Hope. In beatitude and felicity, the fulfillment of intellect and will\nrespectively, the virtues of Faith and Hope fall away, and do not\nexist, for one now sees with the intellect what one believed, and has\nattained what one hoped for with the will.  Only Charity abides. \n\nThomas's reading of Aristotle's argument for the ultimate end as a\nreductio and his own claim that in one sense of it everyone \npursues the ultimate end since one chooses whatever he chooses \nsub ratione boni and as conducive to or a constituent of his\nfulfillment and perfection, tell us something important about \nThomas's mode of procedure. We said earlier that philosophy begins \nfrom pre-philosophical principles already had by everyone. In the \nmoral order, it is essential that one uncover the starting point, the\nlatent presupposition of any action, clarify it and proceed from \nthere. This procedure is equally manifest in Thomas's treatment of \nwhat he calls natural law.  \n\nWhat is natural law? One description of it is: the peculiarly human\nparticipation in the eternal law, in providence. All creatures are\nordered to an end, have natures whose fulfillment is what it is\nbecause of those natures. It is not peculiar to man that he is\nfashioned so as to find his good in the fulfillment of his nature.\nThat is true of anything. But other things are ordered to ends of\nwhich they themselves are not conscious. It is peculiar to man that he\nbecomes aware of the good and freely directs himself to it. Of course\nman is not free to choose the good—any choice is a choice under\nthe aspect of the good. And as to what is really as opposed to only\napparently his good, he is not free to make that what it is. He is,\nhowever, free to direct himself or not to his true end. \n\nA second description of natural law is: the first principles or\nstarting points of practical reasoning. To indicate what he means by\nthis, Thomas invokes the analogy of the starting points of reasoning\nas such. We have already mentioned the distinction between knowledge\nof the simple and knowledge of the complex. The former is a concept\nand is expressed in a definition or description. The latter is an\naffirmation or negation of one thing of another. There is something\nwhich is first in each of these orders. That is, Thomas holds that\nthere is a conception which is prior to and presupposed by all other\nconceptions and a judgment that is prior to and presupposed by all\nother judgments. Since knowledge is expressed by language, this seems\nto come down to the assertion that there is a first word that everyone\nutters and a first statement that would appear in everyone's baby book\non the appropriate page. But surely that is false. So what does Thomas\nmean? \n\nHe says that our first conception is of being, of that which is, and\nour first judgment is that you cannot affirm and deny the same thing\nin the same sense simultaneously. Since few if any humans first utter\n‘being’ or its equivalent and no one fashions as his first\nenunciation the principle of contradiction, facts as known to Thomas\nas ourselves, his meaning must be more subtle. It is that whatever\nconcept one first forms and expresses verbally—Mama, hot,\nwhatever,is a specification or an instance of that which\nis, being. Aristotle had observed that children at first call\nall men father and all women mother. The terms then function as\ngeneric for any male or female. Even more basically, each presupposes\nthat what is generically grasped is an instance of being. Being is\nprior not because it is grasped absolutely, without reference to this\nbeing or that. It is some particular being that is first of all\ngrasped, and however it is named it will mean minimally something that\nis. \n\nSo too with regard to the first judgment. Children express their\nrecognition of this principle when they disagree over the location of\nsome quite specific thing, say a baseball mitt. One accuses the other\nof taking it. You did. I didn't. You did. I didn't. A fundamental\ndisagreement. But what they are agreed on is that if it were true that\none did it could not simultaneously and in the same sense be true that\nhe did not. The principle is latent in, implicit in, any concrete\njudgment just as being is involved in any other conception. \n\nIt is on an analogy with these starting points of thinking as such\nthat Thomas develops what he means by natural law. In the practical\norder there is a first concept analogous to being in the theoretical\norder and it is the good. The good means what is sought as fulfilling\nof the seeker. The first practical judgment is: the good should be\ndone and pursued and evil avoided. Any other practical judgment is a\nspecification of this one and thus includes it. Natural Law consists\nof this first judgment and other most general ones that are beyond\ncontest. These will be fashioned with reference to constituents of our\ncomplete good—existence, food, drink, sex and family, society,\ndesire to know. We have natural inclinations to such goods.  Natural\nlaw precepts concerning them refer the objects of natural inclinations\nto our overall or integral good, which they specify. \n\nMost moral judgments are true, if true, only by and large. They\nexpress means to achieve our overall good. But because there is not a\nnecessary connection between the means and end, they can hold only for\nthe most part. Thus there are innumerable ways in which human beings\nlead their lives in keeping with the ultimate end. Not all means are\nnecessarily related to the end. Moral philosophy reposes on natural\nlaw precepts as common presuppositions, but its advice will be true\nonly in the main.  So the lives of human beings will show a great deal\nof variation in the ways they pursue the human end in accord with\nthese general principles.  Thus the need for the virtues bearing upon\nthe contingencies of life, Prudence in particular. \n\nIt might be noted that when Thomas, following Aristotle, says that man\nis by nature a social or political animal, he does not mean that each\nof us has a tendency to enter into social contracts or the like.  The\nnatural in this sense is what is not chosen, but given, and what is\ngiven about human life is that we are in the first place born into the\ncommunity of the family, are dependent on it for years in order to\nsurvive, and that we flourish as human beings within various larger\nsocial and political communities. The moral consists in behaving well\nin these given settings. \n\nThomas's teaching came under attack, largely by Franciscans,\nimmediately after his death. Dominicans responded. This had the effect\nof making Dominicans Thomists and Franciscans\nnon–Thomists—Bonaventurians, Scotists, Ockhamists. The\nJesuits were founded after the Reformation and they tended to be\nThomists, often with a Suarezian twist.  \n\nWhen in 1879 Leo XIII issued the encyclical Aeterni Patris\ncalling for the revival of the study of Thomas Aquinas, he was not\ndirecting his readers to one school as opposed to others. Thomas was\nput forward as the paladin of philosophy in its true sense, as over\nand against the vagaries of modern thought since Descartes. The\nresponse to Leo's call was global and sustained. New journals and\nlearned societies were founded, curricula were reshaped to benefit\nfrom the thought of Thomas and this not simply in seminaries and\npontifical universities but throughout the world in colleges and\nuniversities. Such giants as Jacques Maritain and Etienne Gilson may\nbe taken to symbolize the best of this Thomistic revival. \n\nVatican II, the ecumenical council that met from 1962–1965 drew\nthis stage of the Thomistic Revival to a close. It was widely held\nthat the Council had dethroned Thomas in favor of unnamed contemporary\nphilosophers. (When they were named, quarrels began.) In the\npost-conciliar period, Catholics have adopted many contemporary\nphilosophical trends with mixed results, as the speed with which such\ntrends come and go has appeared to accelerate, without obvious lasting\nresults. Now with the vogue of the notion that modernity has failed\nand the Enlightenment Project come a cropper, many, Catholics and\nnon-Catholics alike, are turning to Thomas as a spur or foil for their\nthinking. In 1998 John Paul II issued an encyclical called\nFides et Ratio. In its reaffirmation of the importance of \nThomas, it may be regarded as the charter of the Thomism of the \nthird millennium.","contact.mail":"jocalla1@nd.edu","contact.domain":"nd.edu"}]
