Thus set theory has served\nquite a unique role by systematizing modern mathematics, and\napproaching in a unified form all basic questions about admissible\nmathematical arguments—including the thorny question of\nexistence principles. This entry covers in outline the convoluted\nprocess by which set theory came into being, covering roughly the\nyears 1850 to 1930.\n\n\nIn 1910, Hilbert wrote that set theory is \n\n\n\n\nthat mathematical discipline which today occupies an outstanding role\nin our science, and radiates [ausströmt] its powerful\ninfluence into all branches of mathematics. [Hilbert 1910, 466; \ntranslation by entry author] \n\n\n\nThis already suggests that, in order to discuss the early history, it\nis necessary to distinguish two aspects of set theory: its role as a\nfundamental language and repository of the basic principles of modern\nmathematics; and its role as an independent branch of mathematics,\nclassified (today) as a branch of mathematical logic. Both aspects are\nconsidered here. \n\n\nThe first section examines the origins and emergence of set\ntheoretic mathematics around 1870; this is followed by a discussion of\nthe period of expansion and consolidation of the theory up to\n1900. Section 3 provides a look at the critical period in the\ndecades 1897 to 1918, and Section 4 deals with the time from Zermelo to\nGödel (from theory to metatheory), with special attention to the\noften overlooked, but crucial, descriptive set theory. \n\nThe concept of a set appears deceivingly simple, at least to the\ntrained mathematician, and to such an extent that it becomes difficult\nto judge and appreciate correctly the contributions of the pioneers.\nWhat cost them much effort to produce, and took the mathematical\ncommunity considerable time to accept, may seem to us rather\nself-explanatory or even trivial. Three historical misconceptions that\nare widespread in the literature should be noted at the outset:  \nAll of these points shall become clear in what follows. \nThe notion of a collection is as old as counting, and logical ideas\nabout classes have existed since at least the “tree of\nPorphyry” (3rd century CE). Thus it becomes difficult\nto sort out the origins of the concept of set. But sets are neither\ncollections in the everyday sense of this word, nor\n“classes” in the sense of logicians before the\nmid-19th century. The key missing element is objecthood\n— a set is a mathematical object, to be operated upon just like\nany other object (the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is as much ‘a\nthing’ as number 3). To clarify this point, Russell employed the\nuseful distinction between a class-as-many (this is the traditional\nidea) and a class-as-one (or set).  \nErnst Zermelo, a crucial figure in our\nstory, said that the theory had historically been “created by\nCantor and Dedekind” [Zermelo 1908, 262]. This suggests a good\npragmatic criterion: one should start from authors who have\nsignificantly influenced the conceptions of Cantor, Dedekind, and\nZermelo. For the most part, this is the criterion adopted here.\nNevertheless, as every rule calls for an exception, the case of\nBolzano is important and instructive, even though Bolzano did not\nsignificantly influence later writers. \nIn 19th century German-speaking areas, there were some\nintellectual tendencies that promoted the acceptance of the actual\ninfinite (e.g., a revival of Leibniz’s thought). In spite of\nGauss’s warning that the infinite can only be a manner of\nspeaking, some minor figures and three major ones (Bolzano, Riemann,\nDedekind) preceded Cantor in fully accepting the actual infinite in\nmathematics. Those three authors were active in promoting a\nset-theoretic formulation of mathematical ideas, with Dedekind’s\ncontribution in a good number of classic writings (1871, 1872,\n1876/77, 1888) being of central importance. \nChronologically, Bernard Bolzano was the first, but he exerted almost\nno influence. The high quality of his work in logic and the\nfoundations of mathematics is well known. A book entitled\nParadoxien des Unendlichen was posthumously published in\n1851. Here Bolzano argued in detail that a host of paradoxes\nsurrounding infinity are logically harmless, and mounted a forceful\ndefence of actual infinity. He proposed an interesting argument\nattempting to prove the existence of infinite sets, which bears\ncomparison with Dedekind’s later argument (1888). Although he\nemployed complicated distinctions of different kinds of sets or\nclasses, Bolzano recognized clearly the possibility of putting two\ninfinite sets in one-to-one correspondence, as one can easily do,\ne.g., with the intervals \\([0, 5]\\) and \\([0, 12]\\) by the function\n\\(5y = 12x\\). However, Bolzano resisted the conclusion that both sets\nare “equal with respect to the multiplicity of their\nparts” [1851, 30–31]. In all likelihood, traditional ideas\nof measurement were still too powerful in his way of thinking, and\nthus he missed the discovery of the concept of cardinality (however,\none may consider Non-Cantorian ideas, on which see Mancosu 2009).  \nThe case of Bolzano suggests that a liberation from metric concepts\n(which came with the development of theories of projective geometry\nand especially of topology) was to have a crucial role in making\npossible the abstract viewpoint of set theory. Bernhard Riemann\nproposed visionary ideas about topology, and about basing all of\nmathematics on the notion of set or “manifold” in the\nsense of class (Mannigfaltigkeit), in his celebrated\ninaugural lecture “On the Hypotheses which lie at the\nFoundations of Geometry” (1854/1868a). Also characteristic of\nRiemann was a great emphasis on conceptual mathematics,\nparticularly visible in his approach to complex analysis (which again\nwent deep into topology). To give but the simplest example, Riemann\nwas an enthusiastic follower of Dirichlet’s idea that a function\nhas to be conceived as an arbitrary correspondence between\nnumerical values, be it representable by a formula or not; this meant\nleaving behind the times when a function was defined to be an analytic\nexpression. Through this new style of mathematics, and through his\nvision of a new role for sets and a full program for developing\ntopology, Riemann was a crucial influence on both Dedekind and\nCantor (see Ferreirós 1999). \nThe five-year period 1868–1872 saw a mushrooming of\nset-theoretic proposals in Germany, so much so that we could regard it\nas the birth of set-theoretic mathematics. Riemann’s geometry\nlecture, delivered in 1854, was published by Dedekind in 1868, jointly\nwith Riemann’s paper on trigonometric series (1854/1868b, which\npresented the Riemann integral). The latter was the starting point for\ndeep work in real analysis, commencing the study of\n“seriously” discontinuous functions. The young Georg\nCantor entered into this area, which led him to the study of\npoint-sets. In 1872 Cantor introduced an operation upon point sets\n(see below) and soon he was ruminating about the possibility to\niterate that operation to infinity and beyond: it was the first\nglimpse of the transfinite realm. \nMeanwhile, another major development had been put forward by Richard\nDedekind in 1871. In the context of his work on algebraic number\ntheory, Dedekind introduced an essentially set-theoretic viewpoint,\ndefining fields and ideals of algebraic numbers. These ideas were\npresented in a very mature form, making use of set operations and of\nstructure-preserving mappings (see a relevant passage in\nFerreirós 1999: 92–93; Cantor employed Dedekind’s\nterminology for the operations in his own work on set theory around\n1880 [1999: 204]). Considering the ring of integers in a given field\nof algebraic numbers, Dedekind defined certain subsets called\n“ideals” and operated on these sets as new objects. This\nprocedure was the key to his general approach to the topic. In other\nworks, he dealt very clearly and precisely with equivalence relations,\npartition sets, homomorphisms, and automorphisms (on the history of\nequivalence relations, see Asghari ‎2018). Thus, many of the usual\nset-theoretic procedures of twentieth-century mathematics go back to\nhis work. Several years later (in 1888), Dedekind would publish a\npresentation of the basic elements of set theory, making only a bit\nmore explicit the operations on sets and mappings he had been using\nsince 1871. \nThe following year, Dedekind published a paper [1872] in which he\nprovided an axiomatic analysis of the structure of the set\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) of real numbers. He defined it as an ordered field\nthat is also complete (in the sense that all Dedekind-cuts on\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) correspond to an element in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\));\ncompleteness in that sense has the Archimedean axiom as a consequence.\nCantor too provided a definition of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) in 1872,\nemploying Cauchy sequences of rational numbers, which was an elegant\nsimplification of the definition offered by Carl Weierstrass in his\nlectures. The form of completeness axiom that Weierstrass preferred\nwas Bolzano’s principle that a sequence of nested closed\nintervals in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) (a sequence such that\n\\([a_{m+1},b_{m+1}] \\subset [a_{m},b_{m}]\\)) “contains” at\nleast one real number (or, as we would say, has a non-empty\nintersection). \nThe Cantor and Dedekind definitions of the real numbers relied\nimplicitly on set theory, and can be seen in retrospect to involve the\nassumption of a Power Set principle. Both took as given the set of\nrational numbers, and for the definition of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) they relied\non a certain totality of infinite sets of rational numbers (either the\ntotality of Cauchy sequences, or of all Dedekind cuts). With this,\ntoo, constructivistic criticism of set theory began to emerge, as\nLeopold Kronecker started to make objections to such infinitary\nprocedures. Simultaneously, there began a study of the topology of\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\), in particular in the work of Weierstrass, Dedekind,\nand Cantor. The set-theoretic approach was also exploited by several\nauthors in the fields of real analysis and complex analysis (e.g.,\nHankel, du Bois-Reymond, H.J.S. Smith, U. Dini) and by Dedekind in\njoint work with Weber (1882), pioneering algebraic geometry. \nCantor’s derived sets are of particular interest (for the\ncontext of this idea in real analysis, see e.g., Dauben 1979, Hallett\n1984, Lavine 1994, Kanamori 1996, Ferreirós 1999). Cantor took\nas given the “conceptual sphere” of the real numbers, and\nhe considered arbitrary subsets \\(P\\), which he called\n‘point sets’. A real number \\(r\\) is called a\nlimit point of \\(P\\), when all neighbourhoods of \\(r\\)\ncontain points of \\(P\\). This can only happen if \\(P\\) is\ninfinite. With that concept, due to Weierstrass, Cantor went on to\ndefine the derived set \\(P'\\) of \\(P\\), as the set of\nall the limit points of \\(P\\). In general \\(P'\\) may be infinite\nand have its own limit points (see Cantor’s paper in Ewald\n[1996, vol. 2, 840ff], esp. p. 848). Thus one can iterate the\noperation and obtain further derived sets \\(P''\\), \\(P'''\\)…\n\\(P^{(n)}\\) … It is easy to give examples of a set \\(P\\) that\nwill give rise to non-empty derived sets \\(P^{(n)}\\) for all finite\n\\(n\\). (A rather trivial example is \\(P = \\mathbf{Q}_{[0,1]}\\), the\nset of rational numbers in the unit interval; in this case \\(P' =\n[0,1] = P''\\).) Thus one can define \\(P^{(\\infty)}\\) as the\nintersection of all \\(P^{(n)}\\) for finite \\(n\\). This was\nCantor’s first encounter with transfinite iterations. \nThen, in late 1873, came a surprising discovery that fully opened the\nrealm of the transfinite. In correspondence with Dedekind (see Ewald\n1996, vol. 2), Cantor asked the question whether the infinite sets\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of the natural numbers and \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) of\nreal numbers can be placed in one-to-one correspondence. In reply,\nDedekind offered a surprising proof that the set \\(A\\) of all\nalgebraic numbers is denumerable (i.e., there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence with \\(\\mathbf{N}\\)). A few days later, Cantor was\nable to prove that the assumption that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is\ndenumerable leads to a contradiction. To this end, he employed the\nBolzano-Weierstrass principle of completeness mentioned above. Thus he\nhad shown that there are more elements in \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) than in\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) or \\(A\\), in the precise\nsense that the cardinality of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is strictly greater\nthan that of \\(\\mathbf{N}\\). \nSet theory was beginning to become an essential ingredient of the new\n“modern” approach to mathematics. But this viewpoint was\ncontested, and its consolidation took a rather long time.\nDedekind’s algebraic style only began to find followers in the\n1890s; David Hilbert was among them. The soil was better prepared for\nthe modern theories of real functions: Italian, German, French and\nBritish mathematicians contributed during the 1880s. And the new\nfoundational views were taken up by Peano and his followers, by Frege\nto some extent, by Hilbert in the 1890s, and later by Russell. \nMeanwhile, Cantor spent the years 1878 to 1885 publishing key works\nthat helped turn set theory into an autonomous branch of mathematics.\nLet’s write \\(A \\equiv B\\) in order to express that the two sets\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\) can be put in one-to-one correspondence (have\nthe same cardinality). After proving that the irrational numbers can\nbe put in one-to-one correspondence with \\(\\mathbf{R}\\), and,\nsurprisingly, that also \\(\\mathbf{R}^{n} \\equiv \\mathbf{R}\\), Cantor\nconjectured in 1878 that any subset of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) would be\neither denumerable \\((\\equiv \\mathbf{N})\\) or \\(\\equiv \\mathbf{R}\\).\nThis is the first and weakest form of the celebrated Continuum\nHypothesis. During the following years, Cantor explored the world\nof point sets, introducing several important topological ideas (e.g.,\nperfect set, closed set, isolated set), and arrived at results such as\nthe Cantor-Bendixson theorem. \nA point set \\(P\\) is closed iff its derived set \\(P'\n\\subseteq P\\), and perfect iff \\(P = P'\\). The\nCantor-Bendixson theorem then states that a closed point set can be\ndecomposed into two subsets \\(R\\) and \\(S\\), such that\n\\(R\\) is denumerable and \\(S\\) is perfect (indeed,\n\\(S\\) is the \\(a\\)th derived set of \\(P\\),\nfor a countable ordinal \\(a\\)). Because of this, closed sets are\nsaid to have the perfect set property. Furthermore, Cantor was able to\nprove that perfect sets have the power of the continuum (1884). Both\nresults implied that the Continuum Hypothesis is valid for all closed\npoint sets. Many years later, in 1916, Pavel Aleksandrov and Felix\nHausdorff were able to show that the broader class of Borel sets have\nthe perfect set property too. \nHis work on points sets led Cantor, in 1882, to conceive of the\ntransfinite numbers (see Ferreirós 1999:\n267ff). This was a turning point in his research, for from\nthen onward he studied abstract set theory independently of\nmore specific questions having to do with point sets and their\ntopology (until the mid-1880s, these questions had been prominent in\nhis agenda). Subsequently, Cantor focused on the transfinite cardinal\nand ordinal numbers, and on general order types, independently of the\ntopological properties of \\(\\mathbf{R}\\). \nThe transfinite ordinals were introduced as new numbers in an\nimportant mathematico-philosophical paper of 1883, Grundlagen\neiner allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (notice that Cantor\nstill uses Riemann’s term Mannigfaltigkeit or\n‘manifold’ to denote sets). Cantor defined them by means\nof two “generating principles”: the first (1) yields the\nsuccessor \\(a+1\\) for any given number \\(a\\), while the second (2)\nstipulates that there is a number \\(b\\) which follows immediately\nafter any given sequence of numbers without a last element. Thus,\nafter all the finite numbers comes, by (2), the first transfinite\nnumber, \\(\\omega\\) (read: omega); and this is followed by\n\\(\\omega+1\\), \\(\\omega+2\\), …, \\(\\omega+\\omega = \\omega \\cdot\n2\\), …, \\(\\omega \\cdot n\\), \\(\\omega\\cdot n +1\\), …,\n\\(\\omega^{2}\\), \\(\\omega^{2}+1\\), …, \\(\\omega^{\\omega}\\),\n… and so on and on. Whenever a sequence without last element\nappears, one can go on and, so to say, jump to a higher stage by\n(2). \nThe introduction of these new numbers seemed like idle speculation to\nmost of his contemporaries, but for Cantor they served two very\nimportant functions. To this end, he classified the transfinite\nordinals as follows: the “first number class” consisted of\nthe finite ordinals, the set \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) of natural numbers;\nthe “second number class” was formed by ω and all\nnumbers following it (including \\(\\omega^{\\omega}\\), and many more)\nthat have only a denumerable set of predecessors. This\ncrucial condition was suggested by the problem of proving the\nCantor-Bendixson theorem (see Ferreirós 1995). On that basis,\nCantor could establish the results that the cardinality of the\n“second number class” is greater than that of\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\); and that no intermediate cardinality exists. Thus,\nif you write \\(\\textit{card}(\\mathbf{N}) = \\aleph_{0}\\) (read: aleph\nzero), his theorems justified calling the cardinality of the\n“second number class” \\(\\aleph_{1}\\). \nAfter the second number class comes a “third number class”\n(all transfinite ordinals whose set of predecessors has cardinality\n\\(\\aleph_{1}\\)); the cardinality of this new number class can be\nproved to be \\(\\aleph_{2}\\). And so on. The first function of the\ntransfinite ordinals was, thus, to establish a well-defined scale of\nincreasing transfinite cardinalities. (The aleph notation used above\nwas introduced by Cantor only in 1895.) This made it possible to\nformulate much more precisely the problem of the continuum;\nCantor’s conjecture became the hypothesis that\n\\(\\textit{card}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\aleph_{1}\\). Furthermore, relying on\nthe transfinite ordinals, Cantor was able to prove the\nCantor-Bendixson theorem, rounding out the results on point sets that\nhe had been elaborating during these crucial years. The\nCantor-Bendixson theorem states: closed sets of \\(\\mathbf{R}^n\\)\n(generalizable to Polish spaces) have the perfect set property, so\nthat any closed set \\(S\\) in \\(\\mathbf{R}^n\\) can be written uniquely\nas the disjoint union of a perfect set \\(P\\) and a countable set\n\\(R\\). Moreover, \\(P\\) is \\(S^α\\) for α countable\nordinal. \nThe study of the transfinite ordinals directed Cantor’s\nattention towards ordered sets, and in particular well-ordered\nsets. A set \\(S\\) is well-ordered by a relation < iff\n< is a total order and every subset of \\(S\\) has a least\nelement in the <-ordering. (The real numbers are not well-ordered\nin their usual order: just consider an open interval. Meanwhile,\n\\(\\mathbf{N}\\) is the simplest infinite well-ordered set.) Cantor\nargued that the transfinite ordinals truly deserve the name of\nnumbers, because they express the “type of order”\nof any possible well-ordered set. Notice also that it was easy for\nCantor to indicate how to reorder the natural numbers so as to make\nthem correspond to the order types \\(\\omega+1\\), \\(\\omega+2\\),\n…, \\(\\omega \\cdot 2\\), …, \\(\\omega \\cdot n\\), …,\n\\(\\omega^2\\), …, \\(\\omega^{\\omega}\\), … and so on. (For\ninstance, reordering \\(\\mathbf{N}\\) in the form: 2, 4, 6,\n…, 5, 15, 25, 35, …, 1, 3, 7, 9, … we obtain a\nset that has order type \\(\\omega\\cdot 3\\).) \nNotice too that the Continuum Hypothesis, if true, would entail that\nthe set \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) of real numbers can indeed be well-ordered.\nCantor was so committed to this viewpoint, that he presented the\nfurther hypothesis that every set can be well-ordered as\n“a fundamental and momentous law of thought”. Some years\nlater, Hilbert called attention to both the Continuum Hypothesis and\nthe well-ordering problem as Problem 1 in his celebrated list of\n‘Mathematische Probleme’ (1900). Doing so was an\nintelligent way of emphasizing the importance of set theory for the\nfuture of mathematics, and the fruitfulness of its new methods and\nproblems. \nIn 1895 and 1897, Cantor published his last two articles. They were a\nwell-organized presentation of his results on the transfinite numbers\n(cardinals and ordinals) and their theory, and also on order types and\nwell-ordered sets. However, these papers did not advance significant\nnew ideas. Unfortunately, Cantor had doubts about a third part he had\nprepared, which would have discussed very important issues having to\ndo with the problem of well-ordering and the paradoxes (see below).\nSurprisingly, Cantor also failed to include in the 1895/97 papers a\ntheorem which he had published some years before which is known simply\nas Cantor’s Theorem: given any set \\(S\\), there exists another\nset whose cardinality is greater (this is the power set\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(S)\\), as we now say—Cantor used instead the set of\nall functions of the form \\(f\\): \\(S \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\), which is\nequivalent). In the same short paper (1892), Cantor presented his\nfamous proof that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) is non-denumerable by the method of\ndiagonalisation, a method which he then extended to prove\nCantor’s Theorem. (A related form of argument had appeared\nearlier in the work of P. du Bois-Reymond [1875], see among others\n[Wang 1974, 570] and [Borel 1898], Note II.) \nMeanwhile, other authors were exploring the possibilities opened by\nset theory for the foundations of mathematics. Most important was\nDedekind’s contribution (1888) with a deep presentation of the\ntheory of the natural numbers. He formulated some basic principles of\nset (and mapping) theory; gave axioms for the natural number system;\nproved that mathematical induction is conclusive and recursive\ndefinitions are flawless; developed the basic theory of arithmetic;\nintroduced the finite cardinals; and proved that his axiom system is\ncategorical. His system had four axioms. Given a function φ\ndefined on \\(S\\), a set \\(N \\subseteq S\\), and a distinguished\nelement \\(1 \\in N\\), they are as follows: \nCondition (β) is crucial since it ensures minimality for the set\nof natural numbers, which accounts for the validity of proofs by\nmathematical induction. \\(N = \\phi_{o}\\{1\\}\\) is read: \\(N\\) is\nthe chain of singleton {1} under the function φ, that is,\nthe minimal closure of {1} under the function φ. In general, one\nconsiders the chain of a set \\(A\\) under an arbitrary mapping\nγ, denoted by \\(\\gamma_{o}(A)\\); in his booklet Dedekind\ndeveloped an interesting theory of such chains, which allowed him to\nprove the Cantor-Bernstein theorem. The theory was later generalized\nby Zermelo and applied by Skolem, Kuratowski, etc. \nIn the following years, Giuseppe Peano gave a more superficial (but\nalso more famous) treatment of the natural numbers, employing the new\nsymbolic language of logic, and Gottlob Frege elaborated his own\nideas, which however fell prey to the paradoxes. An important book\ninspired by the set-theoretic style of thinking was Hilbert’s\nGrundlagen der Geometrie (1899), which took the\n“mathematics of axioms” one step beyond Dedekind through a\nrich study of geometric systems motivated by questions concerning the\nindependence of his axioms. Hilbert’s book made clear the new\naxiomatic methodology that had been shaping up in connection with the\nnovel methods of set theory, and he combined it with the axiomatic\ntrends coming from projective geometry. \nNevertheless, as we said before, there was quite a lot of criticism of\nset-theoretic, infinitarian methods.  As early as 1870, Kronecker had\nbegun to voice critical remarks of a constructivist bent that, many\nyears later, would be echoed by prominent thinkers like Brouwer or\nWittgenstein. Kronecker’s critical orientation pointed in the\nway of renouncing the real number system and classical analysis, in\nfavor of some more stringent form of analysis — twentieth\ncentury examples of this would be predicative analysis (H. Weyl\nbuilding on basic notions of Poincaré, see Feferman 1988) and\nintuitionistic analysis (Brouwer). Even Weierstrass had objections (in\n1874, at least) against the idea of distinguishing sizes of infinity,\nand that on the face of Cantor’s proofs. Examples abound, and so\nduring the 1900s many mathematicians expressed doubts about key ideas\nand methods of set theory. A prototype case is E. Borel, who after\nintroducing the ideas of Cantor in France [1898], became increasingly\nsuspicious of set theory (the five letters exchanged by him and Baire,\nLebesgue, Hadamard in 1905 have become famous; see Ewald [1996,\nvol. 2]). But there are also the cases of Poincaré, Weyl,\nSkolem, and so on. Among philosophers, the most prominent example is\nWittgenstein, who condemned set theory for building on the \"nonsense\"\nof fictitious symbolism, suggesting “wrong imagery”, and\nso on.\n  \nIn the late nineteenth century, it was a widespread idea that pure\nmathematics is nothing but an elaborate form of arithmetic. Thus it\nwas usual to talk about the “arithmetisation” of\nmathematics, and how it had brought about the highest standards of\nrigor. With Dedekind and Hilbert, this viewpoint led to the idea of\ngrounding all of pure mathematics in set theory. The most\ndifficult steps in bringing forth this viewpoint had been the\nestablishment of a theory of the real numbers, and a set-theoretic\nreduction of the natural numbers. Both problems had been solved by the\nwork of Cantor and Dedekind. But precisely when mathematicians were\ncelebrating that “full rigor” had been finally attained,\nserious problems emerged for the foundations of set theory. First\nCantor, and then Russell, discovered the paradoxes in set theory. \nCantor was led to the paradoxes by having introduced the\n“conceptual sphere” of the transfinite numbers. Each\ntransfinite ordinal is the order type of the set of its predecessors;\ne.g., ω is the order type of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}\\), and\n\\(\\omega+2\\) is the order type of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, \\omega,\n\\omega +1\\}\\). Thus, to each initial segment of the series of\nordinals, there corresponds an immediately greater ordinal. Now, the\n“whole series” of all transfinite ordinals would form a\nwell-ordered set, and to it there would correspond a new ordinal\nnumber. This is unacceptable, for this ordinal \\(o\\) would have\nto be greater than all members of the “whole series”, and\nin particular \\(o < o\\). This is usually called the\nBurali-Forti paradox, or paradox of the ordinals (although\nBurali-Forti himself failed to formulate it clearly, see Moore &\nGarciadiego 1981). \nAlthough it is conceivable that Cantor might have found that paradox\nas early as 1883, immediately after introducing the transfinite\nordinals (for arguments in favour of this idea see Purkert &\nIlgauds 1987 and Tait 2000), the evidence indicates clearly that it\nwas not until 1896/97 that he found this paradoxical argument and\nrealized its implications. By this time, he was also able to employ\nCantor’s Theorem to yield the\nCantor paradox, or paradox of the alephs: if there existed a\n“set of all” cardinal numbers (alephs), Cantor’s\nTheorem applied to it would give a new aleph \\(\\aleph\\), such that\n\\(\\aleph < \\aleph\\). The great set theorist realized perfectly well\nthat these paradoxes were a fatal blow to the “logical”\napproaches to sets favoured by Frege and Dedekind. Cantor emphasized\nthat his views were “in diametrical opposition”\nto Dedekind’s, and in particular to his “naïve\nassumption that all well-defined collections, or systems, are\nalso ‘consistent systems’ ” (see the letter\nto Hilbert, Nov. 15, 1899, in Purkert & Ilgauds 1987: 154).\n(Contrary to what has often been claimed, Cantor’s ambiguous\ndefinition of set in his paper of 1895 was intended to be\n“diametrically opposite” to the logicists’\nunderstanding of sets—often called “naïve” set\ntheory, which could more properly be called the dichotomy conception of\nsets, following a suggestion of Gödel.) \nCantor thought he could solve the problem of the paradoxes by\ndistinguishing between “consistent multiplicities” or\nsets, and “inconsistent multiplicities”. But, in the\nabsence of explicit criteria for the distinction, this was simply a\nverbal answer to the problem. Being aware of deficiencies in his new\nideas, Cantor never published a last paper he had been preparing, in\nwhich he planned to discuss the paradoxes and the problem of\nwell-ordering (we know quite well the contents of this unpublished\npaper, as Cantor discussed it in correspondence with Dedekind and\nHilbert; see the 1899 letters to Dedekind in Cantor 1932, or Ewald\n1996: vol. 2). Cantor presented an argument that relied on the\n“Burali-Forti” paradox of the ordinals, and aimed to prove\nthat every set can be well-ordered. This argument was later\nrediscovered by the British mathematician P.E.B. Jourdain, but it is\nopen to criticism because it works with “inconsistent\nmultiplicities” (Cantor’s term in the above-mentioned\nletters). \nCantor’s paradoxes convinced Hilbert and Dedekind that there\nwere important doubts concerning the foundations of set theory.\nHilbert formulated a paradox of his own (Peckhaus & Kahle 2002),\nand discussed the problem with mathematicians in his Göttingen\ncircle. Ernst Zermelo was thus led to discover the paradox of the\n“set” of all sets that are not members of themselves (Rang\n& Thomas 1981). This was independently discovered by Bertrand\nRussell, who was led to it by a careful study of Cantor’s\nTheorem, which conflicted deeply with Russell’s belief in a\nuniversal set. Some time later, in June 1902, he communicated the\n“contradiction” to Gottlob Frege, who was completing his\nown logical foundation of arithmetic, in a well-known letter [van\nHeijenoort 1967, 124]. Frege’s reaction made very clear the\nprofound impact of this contradiction upon the logicist program.\n“Can I always speak of a class, of the extension of a concept?\nAnd if not, how can I know the exceptions?” Faced with this,\n“I cannot see how arithmetic could be given a scientific\nfoundation, how numbers could be conceived as logical objects”\n(Frege 1903: 253). \nThe publication of Volume II of Frege’s Grundgesetze\n(1903), and above all Russell’s work The Principles of\nMathematics (1903), made the mathematical community fully aware\nof the existence of the set-theoretic paradoxes, of their impact and\nimportance. There is evidence that, up to then, even Hilbert and\nZermelo had not fully appreciated the damage. Notice that the\nRussell-Zermelo paradox operates with very basic\nnotions—negation and set membership—concepts that had\nwidely been regarded as purely logical. The “set” \\(R =\n\\{x: x \\not\\in x\\}\\) exists according to the principle of\ncomprehension (which allows any open sentence to determine a class),\nbut if so, \\(R \\in R \\textit{ iff } R \\not\\in R\\). It is a direct\ncontradiction to the principle favoured by Frege and Russell. \nIt was obviously necessary to clarify the foundations of set theory,\nbut the overall situation did not make this an easy task. The\ndifferent competing viewpoints were widely divergent. Cantor had a\nmetaphysical understanding of set theory and, although he had one of\nthe sharpest views of the field, he could not offer a precise\nfoundation. It was clear to him (as it had been, somewhat\nmysteriously, to Ernst Schröder in his Vorlesungen über\ndie Algebra der Logik, 1891) that one has to reject the idea of a\nUniversal Set, favoured by Frege and Dedekind. Frege and Russell based\ntheir approach on the principle of comprehension, which was shown\ncontradictory. Dedekind avoided that principle, but he postulated that\nthe Absolute Universe was a set, a “thing” in his\ntechnical sense of Gedankending; and he coupled that\nassumption with full acceptance of arbitrary subsets. \nThis idea of admitting arbitrary subsets had been one of the deep\ninspirations of both Cantor and Dedekind, but none of them had\nthematized it. (Here, their modern understanding of analysis played a\ncrucial but implicit background role, since they worked within the\nDirichlet-Riemann tradition of “arbitrary” functions.) As\nfor the now famous iterative conception there were some elements of it\n(particularly in Dedekind’s work, with his iterative development\nof the number system, and his views on “systems” and\n“things”), but it was conspicuously absent from many of\nthe relevant authors. Typically, e. g., Cantor did not iterate the\nprocess of set formation: he tended to consider sets of\nhomogeneous elements, elements which were taken to belong\n“in some conceptual sphere” (either numbers, or points, or\nfunctions, or even physical particles—but not intermingled). The\niterative conception was first suggested by Kurt Gödel in [1933],\nin connection with technical work by von Neumann and Zermelo a few\nyears earlier; Gödel would insist on the idea in his well-known\npaper on Cantor’s continuum problem. It came only post\nfacto, after very substantial amounts of set theory had been\ndeveloped and fully systematized. \nThis variety of conflicting viewpoints contributed much to the overall\nconfusion, but there was more. In addition to the paradoxes discussed\nabove (set-theoretic paradoxes, as we say), the list of\n“logical” paradoxes included a whole array of further ones\n(later called “semantic”). Among these are paradoxes due\nto Russell, Richard, König, Berry, Grelling, etc., as well as the\nancient liar paradox due to Epimenides. And the diagnoses and proposed\ncures for the damage were tremendously varied. Some authors, like\nRussell, thought it was essential to find a new logical system that\ncould solve all the paradoxes at once. This led him into the ramified\ntype theory that formed the basis of Principia Mathematica (3\nvolumes, Whitehead and Russell 1910–1913), his joint work with Alfred\nWhitehead. Other authors, like Zermelo, believed that most of those\nparadoxes dissolved as soon as one worked within a restricted\naxiomatic system. They concentrated on the “set-theoretic”\nparadoxes (as we have done above), and were led to search for\naxiomatic systems of set theory. \nEven more importantly, the questions left open by Cantor and\nemphasized by Hilbert in his first problem of 1900 caused heated\ndebate. At the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg,\n1904, Gyula (Julius) König proposed a very detailed proof that\nthe cardinality of the continuum cannot be any of\nCantor’s alephs. His proof was only flawed because he had relied\non a result previously “proven” by Felix Bernstein, a\nstudent of Cantor and Hilbert. It took some months for Felix Hausdorff\nto identify the flaw and correct it by properly stating the special\nconditions under which Bernstein’s result was valid (see\nHausdorff 2001, vol. 1). Once thus corrected, König’s\ntheorem became one of the very few results restricting the possible\nsolutions of the continuum problem, implying, e.g., that\n\\(\\textit{card}(\\mathbf{R})\\) is not equal to \\(\\aleph_{\\omega}\\).\nMeanwhile, Zermelo was able to present a proof that every set can be\nwell-ordered, using the Axiom of Choice [1904]. During the following\nyear, prominent mathematicians in Germany, France, Italy and England\ndiscussed the Axiom of Choice and its acceptability. \nThe Axiom of Choice states: For every set \\(A\\) of non-empty sets, there exists a set that has exactly one element in common with each set in \\(A\\).\nThis started a whole era during which the Axiom of Choice was treated\nmost carefully as a dubious hypothesis (see the monumental study by\nMoore 1982). And that is ironic, for, among all of the usual\nprinciples of set theory, the Axiom of Choice is the only one that\nexplicitly enforces the existence of some arbitrary subsets. But,\nimportant as this idea had been in motivating Cantor and Dedekind, and\nhowever entangled it is with classical analysis, infinite arbitrary\nsubsets were rejected by many other authors. Among the most\ninfluential ones in the following period, one ought to emphasize the\nnames of Russell, Hermann Weyl, and of course Brouwer.  Choice was, for a long time, a controversial axiom. On the one\nhand, it is of wide use in mathematics and, indeed, it’s key to\nmany important theorems of analysis (this became gradually clear with\nworks such as Sierpiński [1918]). On the other hand, it has\nrather unintuitive consequences, such as the Banach-Tarski Paradox,\nwhich says that the unit ball can be partitioned into finitely-many\n‘pieces’ (subsets), which can then be rearranged to form\ntwo unit balls (see Tomkowicz & Wagon [2019]). The objections to\nthe axiom arise from the fact that it asserts the existence of sets\nthat cannot be explicitly defined. During the 1920s and 1930s, there\nexisted the ritual practice of mentioning it explicitly, whenever a\ntheorem would depend on the axiom. This stopped only after\nGödel’s proof of relative consistency, discussed\nbelow.  \nThe impressive polemics which surrounded his Well-Ordering Theorem,\nand the most interesting and difficult problem posed by the\nfoundations of mathematics, led Zermelo to concentrate on axiomatic\nset theory. As a result of his incisive analysis, in 1908 he published\nhis axiom system, showing how it blocked the known paradoxes and yet\nallowed for a masterful development of the theory of cardinals and\nordinals. This, however, is the topic of another entry (on the life\nand work of Zermelo, see Ebbinghaus [2015]). \nIn the period 1900–1930, the rubric “set theory” was\nstill understood to include topics in topology and the theory of\nfunctions. Although Cantor, Dedekind, and Zermelo had left that stage\nbehind to concentrate on pure set theory, for mathematicians at large\nthis would still take a long time. Thus, at the first International\nCongress of Mathematicians, 1897, keynote speeches given by Hadamard\nand Hurwitz defended set theory on the basis of its importance for\nanalysis. Around 1900, motivated by topics in analysis, important work\nwas done by three French experts: Borel [1898], Baire [1899] and\nLebesgue [1902] [1905]. Their work inaugurated the development of\ndescriptive set theory by extending Cantor’s studies on\ndefinable sets of real numbers (in which he had established that the\nContinuum Hypothesis is valid for closed sets). They introduced the\nhierarchy of Borel sets, the Baire hierarchy of functions, and the\nconcept of Lebesgue measure—a crucial concept of modern\nanalysis. \nDescriptive set theory (DST) is the study of certain kinds of\ndefinable sets of real numbers, which are obtained from simple kinds\n(like the open sets and the closed sets) by well-understood operations\nlike complementation or projection. The Borel sets were the\nfirst hierarchy of definable sets, introduced in the 1898 book of\nÉmile Borel; they are obtained from the open sets by iterated\napplication of the operations of countable union and complementation.\nIn 1905 Lebesgue studied the Borel sets in an epochal memoir, showing\nthat their hierarchy has levels for all countable ordinals, and\nanalyzing the Baire functions as counterparts of the Borel sets. The\nmain aim of descriptive set theory is to find structural properties\ncommon to all such definable sets: for instance, the Borel sets were\nshown to have the perfect set property (if uncountable, they have a\nperfect subset) and thus to comply with the continuum hypothesis (CH).\nThis result was established in 1916 by Hausdorff and by Alexandroff,\nworking independently. Other important “regularity\nproperties” studied in DST are the property of being Lebesgue\nmeasurable, and the so-called property of Baire (to differ from an\nopen set by a so-called meager set, or set of first category). \nAlso crucial at the time was the study of the analytic sets,\nnamely the continuous images of Borel sets, or equivalently, the\nprojections of Borel sets. The young Russian mathematician Mikhail\nSuslin found a mistake in Lebesgue’s 1905 memoir when he\nrealized that the projection of a Borel set is not Borel in general\n[Suslin 1917]. However, he was able to establish that the analytic\nsets, too, possess the perfect set property and thus verify CH. By\n1923 Nikolai Lusin and Wacław Sierpiński were studying the\nco-analytic sets, and this was to lead them to a new\nhierarchy of projective sets, which starts with the analytic\nsets \\((\\Sigma^{1}_{1})\\), their complements (co-analytic,\n\\(\\Pi^{1}_{1}\\) sets), the projections of these last\n(\\(\\Sigma^{1}_{2}\\) sets), their complements (\\(\\Pi^{1}_{2}\\) sets),\nand so on. During the 1920s much work was done on these new types of\nsets, mainly by Polish mathematicians around Sierpiński and by\nthe Russian school of Lusin and his students. A crucial result\nobtained by Sierpiński was that every \\(\\Sigma^{1}_{2}\\) set is the\nunion of \\(\\aleph_{1}\\) Borel sets (the same holds for\n\\(\\Sigma^{1}_{1}\\) sets), but this kind of traditional research on the\ntopic would stagnate after around 1940 (see Kanamori [1995]). \nSoon Lusin, Sierpiński and their colleagues were finding extreme\ndifficulties in their work. Lusin was so much in despair that, in a\npaper of 1925, he came to\nthe “totally unexpected” conclusion that “one does\nnot know and one will never know” whether the projective sets\nhave the desired regularity properties (quoted in Kanamori 1995: 250).\nSuch comments are highly interesting in the light of later\ndevelopments, which have led to hypotheses that solve all the relevant\nquestions (Projective Determinacy, in particular). They underscore the difficult\nmethodological and philosophical issues raised by these more recent\nhypotheses, namely the problem concerning the kind of evidence that\nbacks them. \nLusin summarized the state of the art in his 1930 book\nLeçons sur les ensembles analytiques (Paris,\nGauthier-Villars), which was to be a key reference for years to come.\nSince this work, it has become customary to present results in DST for\nthe Baire space \\( ^{\\omega}\\)\\(\\omega\\) of infinite sequences of natural\nnumbers, which in effect had been introduced by René Baire in a\npaper published in 1909. Baire space is endowed with a certain\ntopology that makes it homeomorphic to the set of the irrational\nnumbers, and it is regarded by experts to be “perhaps the most\nfundamental object of study of set theory” next to the set of\nnatural numbers [Moschovakis 1994, 135]. \nThis stream of work on DST must be counted among the most important\ncontributions made by set theory to analysis and topology. But what\nhad begun as an attempt to prove the Continuum Hypothesis could not\nreach this goal. Soon it was shown using the Axiom of Choice that\nthere are non-Lebesgue measurable sets of reals (Vitali 1905), and\nalso uncountable sets of reals with no perfect subset (Bernstein\n1908). Such results made clear the impossibility of reaching the goal\nof CH by concentrating on definable and “well-behaved”\nsets of reals. \nAlso, with Gödel’s work around 1940 (and also with forcing\nin the 1960s) it became clear why the research of the 1920s and 30s\nhad stagnated: the fundamental new independence results showed that\nthe theorems established by Suslin (perfect set property for analytic\nsets), Sierpinski (\\(\\Sigma^{1}_{2}\\) sets as unions of \\(\\aleph_{1}\\)\nBorel sets) and a few others were the best possible results on the\nbasis of axiom system ZFC. This is important philosophically: already\nan exploration of the world of sets definable from the open (or\nclosed) sets by complement, countable union, and projection had\nsufficed to reach the limits of the ZFC system. Hence the need for new\naxioms, that Gödel emphasized after World War II [Gödel\n1947]. \nLet us now turn to Cantor’s other main legacy, the study of\ntransfinite numbers. By 1908 Hausdorff was working on uncountable\norder types and introduced the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis\n\\((2^{\\aleph_{a}} = \\aleph_{a+1})\\). He was also the first to consider\nthe possibility of an “exorbitant” cardinal, namely a\nweakly inaccessible, i.e., a regular cardinal that is not a successor\n(a cardinal \\(\\alpha\\) is called regular if decomposing \\(\\alpha\\)\ninto a sum of smaller cardinals requires \\(\\alpha\\)-many such\nnumbers). Few years later, in the early 1910s, Paul Mahlo was studying\nhierarchies of such large cardinals in work that pioneered what was to\nbecome a central area of set theory; he obtained a succession of\ninaccessible cardinals by employing a certain operation that involves\nthe notion of a stationary subset; they are called Mahlo cardinals.\nBut the study of large cardinals developed slowly. Meanwhile,\nHausdorff’s textbook Grundzüge der Mengenlehre\n(1914) introduced two generations of mathematicians into set theory\nand general topology. \nThe next crucial steps into the “very high” infinite were\ndone in 1930. The notion of strongly inaccessible cardinals was then\nisolated by Sierpiński & Tarski, and by Zermelo [1930]. A\nstrong inaccessible is a regular cardinal \\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(2^x\\)\nis less than \\(\\alpha\\) whenever \\(x < \\alpha\\). While weak\ninaccessibles merely involve closure under the successor operation,\nstrong inaccessibles involve a much stronger notion of closure under\nthe powerset operation. That same year, in a path-breaking paper on\nmodels of ZFC, Zermelo [1930] established a link between the\nuncountable (strongly) inaccessible cardinals and certain\n“natural” models of ZFC (in which work he assumed that the\npowerset operation is, so to say, fully determinate). \nIn that same year, Stanislaw Ulam was led by considerations coming out\nof analysis (measure theory) to a concept that was to become central:\nmeasurable cardinals. It turned out that such cardinals, defined by a\nmeasure-theoretic property, had to be (strongly) inaccessible. Indeed,\nmany years later it would be established (by Hanf, working upon\nTarski’s earlier work) that the first inaccessible cardinal is\nnot measurable, showing that these new cardinals were even more\n“exorbitant”. As one can see, the Polish school led by\nSierpiński had a very central role in the development of set\ntheory between the Wars. Measurable cardinals came to special\nprominence in the late 1960s when it became clear that the existence\nof a measurable cardinal contradicts Gödel’s axiom of\nconstructibility (\\(V = L\\) in the class notation). This again\nvindicated Gödel’s convictions, expressed in what is\nsometimes called “Gödel’s program” for new\naxioms. \nSet-theoretic mathematics continued its development into the powerful\naxiomatic and structural approach that was to dominate much of the\n20th century. To give just a couple of examples,\nHilbert’s early axiomatic work (e.g., in his arch-famous\nFoundations of Geometry) was deeply set-theoretic; Ernst\nSteinitz published in 1910 his research on abstract field theory,\nmaking essential use of the Axiom of Choice; and around the same time\nthe study of function spaces began with work by Hilbert, Maurice\nFréchet, and others. During the 1920s and 30s, the first\nspecialized mathematics journal, Fundamenta Mathematicae, was\ndevoted to set theory as then understood (centrally including topology\nand function theory). In those decades structural algebra came of age,\nabstract topology was gradually becoming an independent branch of\nstudy, and the study of set theory initiated its metatheoretic turn. \nEver since, “set theory” has generally been identified\nwith the branch of mathematical logic that studies transfinite sets,\noriginating in Cantor’s result that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\) has a\ngreater cardinality than \\(\\mathbf{N}\\). But, as the foregoing\ndiscussion shows, set theory was both effect and cause of the rise of\nmodern mathematics: the traces of this origin are indelibly stamped on\nits axiomatic structure.","contact.mail":"josef@us.es","contact.domain":"us.es"}]
