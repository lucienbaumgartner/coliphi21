Any\ncomprehensive history of mathematics will mention him for his\ninvestigation of the notions of algebraic number, field, group,\nmodule, lattice, etc., and especially for the invention of his theory\nof ideals (see, e.g., Dieudonné 1985, Boyer & Merzbach\n1991, Stillwell 2000, Kolmogorov & Yushkevich 2001, Wussing 2012).\nDedekind’s more foundational work in mathematics is also widely known.\nOften acknowledged in that connection are: his analysis of the notion\nof continuity, his introduction of the real numbers by means of\nDedekind cuts, his formulation of the Dedekind-Peano axioms for the\nnatural numbers, his proof of the categoricity of these axioms, and\nhis contributions to the early development of set theory\n(Grattan-Guinness 1980, Ferreirós 1996, 1999, 2016b, Jahnke\n2003, Corry 2015).\n\n\nWhile many of Dedekind’s contributions to mathematics and its\nfoundations are thus common knowledge, they are seldom discussed\ntogether. In particular, his foundational writings are often treated\nseparately from his other writings. This entry provides a broader and\nmore integrative survey. The main focus will be on Dedekind’s\nfoundational writings, but they will be related to his mathematical\nwork as a whole. Indeed, it will be argued that foundational concerns\nare at play throughout, so that any attempt to distinguish sharply\nbetween his “mathematical” and his\n“foundational” work is artificial and misleading. Another\ngoal of the entry is to establish the continuing relevance of his\ncontributions to the philosophy of mathematics. Their full\nsignificance has only started to be recognized, as should become\nevident. This is especially so with respect to methodological and\nepistemological aspects of Dedekind’s approach, which ground the\nlogical and metaphysical views that emerge in his writings.\n\nRichard Dedekind was born in Brunswick (Braunschweig), a city in\nnorthern Germany, in 1831. Much of his education took place in\nBrunswick as well, where he first attended school and then, for two\nyears, the local technical university. In 1850, he transferred to the\nUniversity of Göttingen, a main center for scientific research in\nEurope. Carl Friedrich Gauss, one of the greatest mathematicians of\nall time, taught in Göttingen, and Dedekind became his last\ndoctoral student. He wrote a dissertation under Gauss, finished in\n1852. As was customary, he also wrote a second dissertation\n(Habilitation), completed in 1854, shortly after that of his\ncolleague and friend Bernhard Riemann. Dedekind stayed in\nGöttingen for four more years, as an unsalaried lecturer\n(Privatdozent). During that time he was strongly influenced\nby P.G.L. Dirichlet, Gauss’s successor in Göttingen, and by\nRiemann, then a rising star. (Dedekind did important editorial\nwork for Gauss, Dirichlet, and Riemann.) In 1858, he moved to the\nPolytechnic in Zürich (later ETH Zürich), Switzerland, to\ntake up his first salaried position. He returned to Brunswick in 1862,\nwhere he became professor at the local university and taught until his\nretirement in 1896. He published most of his major works in this later\nperiod. He also had interactions with important mathematicians\nelsewhere; thus he was in correspondence with Georg Cantor,\ncollaborated with Heinrich Weber, and developed an intellectual\nrivalry with Leopold Kronecker. He stayed in his hometown until the\nend of his life, in 1916. (Cf. Landau 1917, ch. 1 of Dugac 1976,\nScharlau 1981, Mehrten 1982, ch. 1 of Ferreirós 1999, Harborth\net al. 2007, Sonar 2017, for biographical information.) \nDedekind’s main foundational writings are: Stetigkeit und\nirrationale Zahlen (1872) and Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen? (1888a). Equally important, especially in the eyes of\nhistorians of mathematics, is his work in algebraic number theory.\nThat work was first presented in an unusual manner: as supplements to\nDirichlet’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie. The latter\nwas based on Dedekind’s notes from Dirichlet’s lectures, edited\nfurther by him, and published in a series of editions. It is in his\nsupplements to the second edition, from 1871, that Dedekind’s famous\ntheory of ideals was first presented. He modified and expanded it\nseveral times, with a fourth edition published in 1893\n(Lejeune-Dirichlet 1893, Dedekind 1964) and an unfinished fifth\nedition later found in his Nachlass (Scheel 2020). An\nintermediate version of Dedekind’s theory appeared separately in a\nFrench translation (Dedekind 1877). Further works by him include: a\nlong and influential article on the theory of algebraic functions,\nwritten jointly with Heinrich Weber (Dedekind 1882, Dedekind &\nWeber 2012); and a variety of shorter pieces in algebra, number\ntheory, complex analysis, probability theory, etc. All of these works\nwere re-published, together with selections from his\nNachlass, in Dedekind (1930–32). Finally, lecture notes\nfrom some of his own classes were made available later (Dedekind 1981,\n1985), as were further selections from his Nachlass (Dedekind\n1982, also Dugac 1976, Sinaceur 1990, Schlimm 2000) and from his\ncorrespondence (Noether & Cavaillès 1937, Lipschitz 1986,\nMeschkowski & Nilson 1991, Scheel 2014). \nAs this brief chronology indicates, Dedekind was a wide-ranging and\ncreative mathematician, although he tended to publish slowly and\ndeliberately. It also shows that he was part of a distinguished\ntradition in mathematics, extending from Gauss and Dirichlet through\nRiemann, Dedekind himself, Weber, and Cantor in the nineteenth\ncentury, on to David Hilbert, Ernst Zermelo, Emmy Noether, B.L. van\nder Waerden, Nicolas Bourbaki, and others in the twentieth and\ntwenty-first centuries. With some partial exceptions, these\nmathematicians did not publish explicitly philosophical treatises. At\nthe same time, all of them were very sensitive to foundational issues\nin mathematics understood in a broad sense, including the choice of\nbasic concepts, the kinds of reasoning to be used, and the\npresuppositions build into them. Consequently, one can find\nphilosophically pregnant remarks sprinkled through their works, as\nexemplified by Dedekind works. \nNot much is known about other influences on Dedekind, especially\nphilosophical ones. While a student in Göttingen, he did attend a\nlecture class by Hermann Lotze, called “Deutsche Philosophie\nseit Kant” (“German philosophy since Kant”), as is\nclear from notes he took that are preserved in his Nachlass. In his\nshort biography of Riemann (Dedekind 1876a), there is a reference to\nthe post-Kantian philosopher and educator J.F. Herbart, professor in\nGöttingen from 1833 to 1841, as an influence on Riemann; and in\nhis correspondence, Dedekind mentions the German Idealist J.G. Fichte\nin passing (Scharlau 1981, Reck 2017). However, he does not aligns\nhimself explicitly with either of them, nor with any other philosopher\nor philosophical school.  Little is known about which philosophical\ntexts might have shaped Dedekind’s views, especially early on. A rare\npiece of information we have in this connection is that he became\naware of Gottlob Frege’s most philosophical work, Die Grundlagen\nder Arithmetik (published in 1884), only after having settled on\nhis own basic ideas; similarly for Bernard Bolzano’s Paradoxien\ndes Unendlichen (Dedekind 1888a, preface to the second\nedition). Then again, several of Dedekind’s mathematical role models\nhad strong philosophical interests, especially Gauss, Riemann, and\nCantor; and German intellectual life at the time was saturated with\ndiscussions of Kantian and German Idealist views, including debates\nabout the role of intuition for mathematics, and there is evidence\nthat Dedekind was familiar with at least some of them. \nThe issues addressed in Dedekind’s Stetigkeit und irrationale\nZahlen (Continuity and Irrational Numbers) grow out of\nthe “rigorization” and “arithmetization” of\nanalysis (the mathematical theory) in the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury. Yet their roots go deeper, all the way down, or back, to the\ndiscovery of incommensurable magnitudes in Ancient Greek geometry,\ne.g., diagonals in unit squares that have length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (Jahnke\n2003, ch. 1). The Greeks’ response to this startling discovery\nculminated in Eudoxos’ theory of ratios and proportionality, presented\nin Chapter V of Euclid’s Elements (Mueller 1981, ch. 3,\nCorry, ch. 3). This theory brought with it a sharp distinction between\ndiscrete multitudes (numbers) and continuous magnitudes,\nwhich led to the long dominant view of mathematics as the science of\nnumber, on the one hand, and of magnitude, on the other hand.\nDedekind’s first foundational work concerns, at bottom, the\nrelationship between the two sides of this dichotomy. \nAn important part of the dichotomy, as traditionally understood, was\nthat magnitudes and ratios of them were not thought of as numerical\nentities, with arithmetic operations defined on them, but in a more\nconcrete way based on geometry (as lengths, areas, volumes, angles,\netc. and as relations between them). More particularly, while Eudoxos’\ntheory provides a contextual criterion for the equality of ratios, it\ndoes not include a definition of the ratios themselves, so that they\nare not conceived of as independent objects (Stein 1990, Cooke 2005).\nSuch features do little harm with respect to basic applications of the\ntheory; but they lead to inner-mathematical tensions, e.g., when\nsolutions to various algebraic equations are considered (some of which\ncould be represented numerically, others only geometrically). This\ntension came increasingly to the fore in the early modern period,\nespecially after Descartes’ integration of algebra and geometry. What\nwas called for, then, was a unified treatment of discrete and\ncontinuous quantities. \nMore directly and explicitly, Dedekind’s essay was tied to the\narithmetization of analysis in the nineteenth century—pursued by\nCauchy, Bolzano, Weierstrass, and others—which in turn was a\nreaction to tensions within the differential and integral calculus,\nintroduced earlier by Newton, Leibniz, and their followers (Jahnke\n2003, chs. 3–6). As is well known, the inventors of the calculus\nrelied on appeals to “infinitesimal” quantities, typically\nbacked up by geometric or even mechanical considerations, although\nthis was seen as questionable from early on. The nineteenth-century\n“arithmetizers” found a way to avoid infinitesimals (in\nterms of the epsilon-delta characterization of limits familiar from\ncurrent introductions to the calculus). Yet this again, or even more,\nled to the need for a systematic characterization of various\nquantities conceived of as numerical entities, now in the form of a\nunified treatment of rational and irrational numbers. \nDedekind faced this need directly, also from a pedagogical\nperspective, when he started teaching classes on the calculus at\nZürich in 1858 (Dedekind 1872, preface). Consequently, the goal\nfor him was not just to supply a unified and rigorous account of\nrational and irrational numbers; he also wanted to do so in a way that\nestablished the independence of analysis from mechanics and geometry,\nindeed from intuitive considerations more generally. This indicates an\nunderlying philosophical motivation for Dedekind’s work on the\nfoundations of analysis, beyond the pedagogical needs at issue, and it\nis natural to see an implicit anti-Kantian thrust in it. Finally, the\nway in which to achieve all of these objectives was to relate\narithmetic and analysis closely to each other, indeed to reduce the\nlatter to the former. \nWhile the general idea of reducing analysis to arithmetic, as opposed\nto geometry, was not new at the time—Dedekind shared it with and\nadopted it from his teachers Gauss and Dirichlet (Ferreirós\n1999, ch. 4, Merzbach 2018)—the particular manner in which he\nproceeded was quite original. The crucial issue, or the linchpin, for\nhim was the notion of continuity. To get clearer about that notion, he\ncompared the system of rational numbers to the points on a geometric\nline. Once a point of origin, a unit length, and a direction have been\npicked for the latter, the two systems can be correlated\nsystematically: each rational number corresponds, in a unique and\norder-preserving way, to a point on the line. But a further question\narises: Does each point on the line correspond to a rational number?\nCrucially, this question can be reformulated in terms of Dedekind’s\nidea of “cuts” \ndefined directly on the rational numbers,\nso that any geometric intuition concerning continuity can be put\naside. Namely, if we divide the whole system of rational numbers into\ntwo disjoint parts while preserving their order, is each such division\ndetermined by a rational number? The answer is no, since some\ncorrespond to irrational numbers (e.g., the cut consisting of \\(\\{x :\nx^2 \\lt 2\\}\\) and \\(\\{x : x^2 \\gt 2\\}\\) which corresponds to\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)). In this explicit, purely arithmetic, and precise sense,\nthe system of rational numbers is not continuous, i.e. not\nline-complete. \nFor our purposes several aspects of Dedekind’s procedure, at the start\nand in its subsequent steps, are important (cf. Ferreirós \n1999, ch. 4). To begin with, Dedekind starts by considering the\nsystem of rational numbers seen as a whole. Noteworthy here are two\naspects: Not only does he accept this system as an “actual\ninfinity”, i.e. a complete infinite set that is treated as a\nmathematical object in itself; he also considers it\n“structurally”, as an example of a linearly ordered set\nclosed under addition and multiplication (an ordered field). In his\nnext step—and proceeding further along set-theoretic and\nstructuralist lines—Dedekind introduces the set of arbitrary\ncuts on his initial system, thus working essentially with the bigger\nand more complex infinity of all subsets of the rational numbers (the\nfull power set). It is possible to show that the set of those cuts can\nin turn be endowed with a linear ordering and with operations of\naddition and multiplication, thus constituting a totally new\n“number system”. \nIt is not the cuts themselves with which Dedekind wants to work in the\nend, however. Instead, for each cut—those corresponding to\nrational numbers, but especially those corresponding to irrational\nquantities—he “creates” a new object, a “real\nnumber” determined by the cut (cf. Dedekind 1876b, 1888b). Those\nobjects, together with an order relation and arithmetic operations\ndefined on them (in terms of the corresponding cuts), form the crucial\nsystem for him. Next, two properties of the new system are\nestablished: The rational numbers can be embedded into it, in a way\nthat respects the order and the arithmetic operations (a corresponding\nfield homomorphism exists); and the system is continuous, or\nline-complete, with respect to its order. What we get overall is the\nlong missing, unified criterion of identity for rational and\nirrational numbers, both of which are now treated as elements in an\nencompassing number system (isomorphic to but distinct from the\nsystem of cuts). Finally Dedekind indicates how explicit, rigorous,\nand straightforward proofs of various facts about the real numbers can\nbe given along such lines, including ones that had been accepted\nwithout proof so far. These include: basic rules of operation with\nsquare roots; and the theorem that every increasing bounded sequence\nof real numbers has a limit value (a result equivalent to, among\nothers, the more well-known intermediate value theorem.) \nDedekind’s published this account of the real numbers only in 1872,\nfourteen years after developing the basic ideas on which it relies. It\nwas not the only account proposed at the time; indeed, various\nmathematicians addressed this issue, including: Weierstrass, Thomae,\nMéray, Heine, Hankel, Cantor, and, somewhat later, Frege\n(Dieudonné 1985, ch. 6, Boyer & Merzbach 1991, ch. 25,\nJahnke 2003, ch. 10). Most familiar among their alternative approaches\nis probably Cantor’s, also published in 1872. Instead of using\n“Dedekind cuts”, Cantor works with (equivalence classes\nof) Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. The system of such (classes\nof) sequences can also be shown to have the desired properties,\nincluding continuity. Like Dedekind, Cantor starts with the infinite\nset of rational numbers; Cantor’s construction again relies\nessentially on the full power set of the rational numbers, here in the\nform of arbitrary Cauchy sequences; and the two resulting systems are\nisomorphic, as is well known. In these set-theoretic respects the two\ntreatments are thus equivalent. What sets apart Dedekind’s treatment\nof the real numbers, from Cantor’s and all the others, is the clarity\nhe achieves with respect to the central notion of continuity. His\ntreatment is also more elegantly and maturely structuralist, in a\nsense to be spelled out further below. \nProviding an explicit and precise definition of the real numbers\nconstitutes a major step towards completing the arithmetization of\nanalysis. But further reflection on Dedekind’s procedure (and similar\nones) leads to a new question: What is involved in it if thought\nthrough fully, i.e., what does this account of the real numbers rely\non ultimately? As noted, Dedekind starts with the system of rational\nnumbers; he uses a set-theoretic procedure to construct, in a central\nstep, the new system of cuts out of them; and finally, the real\nnumbers are “created” on that basis. This suggests three\nsub-questions: First, how exactly are we to think about the rational\nnumbers in this connection? Second, can anything further be said about\nthe set-theoretic procedures that have been used? And third, how is\nthe creation at issue to be understood? \nIn his published writings, Dedekind does not provide an explicit\nanswer to our first sub-question. What suggests itself from a\ncontemporary point of view is that he relied on the assumption that\nthe rational numbers can be dealt with in terms of the natural numbers\ntogether with some set-theoretic techniques. And in fact, in\nDedekind’s Nachlass explicit sketches of two now familiar\nconstructions can be found: that of the integers as (equivalence\nclasses of) pairs of natural numbers; and that of the rational numbers\nas (equivalence classes of) pairs of integers (Sieg & Schlimm\n2005, earlier Dugac 1976). It seems that these constructions were\nfamiliar enough at the time for Dedekind not to feel the need to\npublish his sketches. (There is also a direct parallel to the\nconstruction of the complex numbers as pairs of real numbers, known to\nDedekind from W.R. Hamilton’s works, and a more general connection to\nthe use of residue classes in developing modular arithmetic. For the\nformer cf. Ferreirós 1999, ch. 7, for the latter Dedekind 1857\nand Dugac 1976.) \nAll the material needed for analysis, including both the rational and\nall the real numbers, can thus be constructed out of the natural\nnumbers by set-theoretic means. At this point the question arises: Do\nwe have to take the natural numbers themselves as given; or can\nanything further be said about those numbers, perhaps by reducing them\nto something even more fundamental? Many mathematicians in the\nnineteenth century were willing to assume the former. A well-known\nexample is Leopold Kronecker, for whom the natural numbers are\n“given by God” while the rest of arithmetic and analysis\nis “made by mankind” (Ferreirós 1999, ch. 4). In\ncontrast Dedekind, and independently Frege, pursued the latter option:\nthey attempted to reduce arithmetic and the natural numbers to\n“logic”. This is the main goal of Was sind und was\nsollen die Zahlen? (The Nature and Meaning of Numbers,\nor more literally, What are the numbers and what are they\nfor?). Another goal is to answer the related second sub-question\nabove: whether more can be said about the set-theoretic procedures\nused. For Dedekind, again similar to Frege, those procedures are part\nof logic. Along the way, Dedekind also attempts to clarify his notion\nof creation. But then, what are the basic notions of\nlogic? \nDedekind’s answer to this last question is: Basic for logic are the\nnotions of object (“Ding”), set (or system,\n“System”), and function (mapping,\n“Abbildung”). \nThese notions are fundamental for human\nthought, as he emphasizes especially for the notion of function. They\nare “logical” \nin the sense of being applicable in all\ndomains, indispensable for exact reasoning, and not reducible further.\n(This interpretation of Dedekind, and with it whether he should\nbe understood as a logicist, is not uncontroversial. For the\ncorresponding controversy, cf. Klev 2017, Reck 2019, and\nFerreirós forthcoming, on the one hand, and Benis-Sinaceur\n2008, 2015, 2017, on the other hand. We will come back to this issue\nin Section 3.) While not analyzable in terms of anything even more\nbasic, the fundamental logical notions are nevertheless capable of\nbeing elucidated, thus of being understood better. Part of their\nelucidation consists in observing what can be done with them,\nincluding how arithmetic can be reconstructed in terms of them (also\nanalysis etc.). For Dedekind that reconstruction starts with the\nconsideration of infinite sets, like in the case of the real numbers,\nbut now in a generalized, more explicit, and more systematic\nmanner. \nDedekind does not just assume, or simply postulate, the existence of\ninfinite sets; he tries to prove it. For that purpose, he considers\n“the totality of all things that can be objects of my\nthought” and argues that this “set” is infinite\n(Dedekind 1888a, section v). He also does not just presuppose the\nconcept of infinity; he defines it (in terms of his three basic\nnotions of logic, as well as the definable notions of subset, union,\nintersection, etc.). The definition is as follows: A set of objects is\ninfinite—“Dedekind-infinite”, as we now say—if\nit can be mapped one-to-one onto a proper subset of itself. (A set can\nthen be defined to be finite if it is not infinite in this sense.)\nMoving a step closer to arithmetic, this leads to the notion of a\n“simple infinity” (or “inductive set”). A\nrigorous introduction of that notion involves Dedekind’s innovative\nidea of a “chain”. As one would say in contemporary\nterminology, a chain is the minimal closure of a set A in a\nset B containing A under a function f on\nB (where being “minimal” is captured of in terms\nof the general notion of intersection). \nWhat it means to be simply infinite can now be captured in four\nconditions: Consider a set S and a subset N of\nS (possibly equal to S). N is called simply\ninfinite if there exists a function f on S and an\nelement 1 of N such that: (i) f maps N into\nitself; (ii) N is the chain (minimal closure) of \\(\\{1\\}\\) in\nS under \\(\\,f\\); (iii) 1 is not in the image of N\nunder \\(f\\); and (iv) \\(f\\) is one-to-one. While at first unfamiliar,\nit is not hard to see that these Dedekindian conditions are a\nnotational variant of Peano’s well-known axioms for the natural\nnumbers. In particular, condition (ii) is a version of the axiom of\nmathematical induction. These axioms are thus properly called the\nDedekind-Peano axioms. (Peano, who published his corresponding work in\n1889, acknowledged Dedekind’s priority; cf. Ferreirós 2005.) As\nis also not hard to see, any simple infinity will consist of a first\nelement corresponding to 1, a second element corresponding to\n\\(f(1)\\), a third corresponding to \\(f(f(1))\\), and so on, just like\nany model of the Dedekind-Peano axioms. \nGiven these preparations, Dedekind introduces the natural numbers as\nfollows: First, he proves that every infinite set contains a simply\ninfinite subset. Then he establishes that any two simply infinite\nsystems (any two models of the Dedekind-Peano axioms) are isomorphic\n(so that the axiom system is categorical). Third, he observes that, as\na consequence, exactly the same arithmetic truths hold for all simple\ninfinities; or closer to Dedekind’s actual way of stating this point,\nany truth about one of them can be translated, via the isomorphism,\ninto a truth about the other. (That is to say, all models of the\nDedekind-Peano axioms are “logically \nequivalent”, which\nmeans that the axiom system is “semantically \ncomplete”;\ncf. Awodey & Reck 2002). In those respects, \neach simply infinity\nis as good as any other. \nAs a further step, Dedekind appeals again to the notion of\n“creation”. \nStarting with some simple infinity constructed\ninitially—it doesn’t matter which one we start with, given their\nisomorphism—he “creates” new objects corresponding\nto its elements, thereby introducing a distinguished simple infinity\nDedekind calls “the natural \nnumbers”. \nAs we saw, this last\nstep is parallel to his introduction of “the real \nnumbers”\n(a parallel confirmed in Dedekind 1888b); but some aspects are clearer in the\npresent case. Namely, the newly created objects are characterized\ncompletely by all arithmetic truths, i.e., by those truths\ntransferable, or invariant, in the sense explained above. In other\nwords, their identity depends on relational or structural\nproperties alone, unlike for the elements of other simple infinities\nwhere intrinsic, non-arithmetic, or \n“foreign” properties\nare built in. In passing, Dedekind also uses the name\n“abstraction” \nfor the step from the initially constructed\nsimple infinity to the newly introduced one. (If Dedekind is\ninterpreted along such lines, his position is a form of\nnon-eliminative structuralism; cf. Reck 2003; but see Sieg &\nMorris 2018 and Benis-Sinaceur 2008, 2015, 2017, respectively, for two\nalternative interpretations. We will again come back to this issue in\nSection 3.) \nConsidered more generally, what Dedekind has introduced is the natural\nnumbers conceived of as finite “ordinal” numbers (or\ncounting numbers: the first, the second, etc.). Later he adds an\nexplanation of how their usual employment as finite\n“cardinal” numbers (answering to the question: how many?)\ncan be recovered. This is done by using initial segments of the number\nseries as tallies: for any set we can ask which such segment, if any,\ncan be mapped one-to-one onto it, thus measuring its\n“cardinality”. (A set turns out to be finite in the sense\ndefined above if and only if there exists such an initial segment of\nthe natural numbers series.) Dedekind rounds off his essay by showing\nhow several basic and so far merely assumed facts in arithmetic can\nnow be proved as well. Especially significant is his purely\n“logical” justification of proofs by mathematical\ninduction and definitions by recursion (based on his theory of\nchains). \nSet-theoretic assumptions and procedures already inform Dedekind’s\nStetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen, as we saw. In particular,\nthe system of rational numbers is assumed to be an infinite set; the\ncollection of arbitrary cuts of rational numbers is treated as another\ninfinite set; and when supplied with an order relation and arithmetic\noperations on its elements, the latter gives rise to a new complete\nordered field. Parallel moves can be found in the sketches, from\nDedekind’s Nachlass, on how to introduce the integers and the\nrational numbers. Once more we start with an infinite system, here\nthat of all the natural numbers, and new number systems are\nconstructed out of it set-theoretically (although the full power set\nis not needed in those cases). Finally, Dedekind uses set-theoretic\ntechniques in his other mathematical work as well (e.g. in his\ntreatment of modular arithmetic and his construction of ideals as\ninfinite sets, to be discussed further below). It should be emphasized\nthat the application of such techniques was novel and bold at the\ntime. While a few mathematicians, such as Cantor, used them as well,\nmany others, like Kronecker, rejected them. In fact, by working\nseriously with actual infinities Dedekind took a stance incompatible\nwith that of his teacher Gauss, who had allowed for the infinite only\nas a “manner of speaking” (cf. Ferreirós 1999, ch.\n7, also Edwards 1983). \nWhat happens in Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?, in the\ncontext of Dedekind’s logicist reconstruction of the natural numbers,\nis that the adoption of set-theoretic techniques is raised to a new\nlevel of clarity and generality. Dedekind not only presents\nset-theoretic definitions of various mathematical notions, he also\nadds a systematic reflection on the means used thereby and he expands\nthat use in certain respects. For those reasons, the essay constitutes\nan important step in the emergence of modern set theory. In addition,\nwe already saw that Dedekind presents the notion of set, together with\nthose of object and function, as basic. Here an object is anything for\nwhich it is determinate how to reason about it, including having\nappropriate criteria of identity (Tait 1996). Sets are\nobjects about which we reason by considering their elements, and this\nis all that matters about them. In other words, sets are to be\nidentified extensionally, as Dedekind is one of the first to\nemphasize. (Even as important a contributor to set theory as Bertrand\nRussell struggles with this point well into the twentieth century.)\nDedekind is also among the first to consider, not just sets of\nnumbers, but sets of other kinds of objects as well. \nFunctions are to be conceived of extensionally too, as ways of\ncorrelating the elements of sets. But unlike in later axiomatic set\ntheory, Dedekind does not reduce functions to sets of tuples. (Not\nunreasonably, he takes the ability to map one thing onto another, or\nto represent one by the other, to be fundamental for human thought;\nDedekind 1888a, preface, cf. Klev 2017). Another important aspect of\nDedekind’s views about functions is that, with respect to their\nintended range, he allows for arbitrary functional correlations\nbetween sets of numbers, indeed between sets of objects more\ngenerally. (For the gradual development of his views in this\nconnection, see Sieg & Schlimm 2005.) He thus rejects previous,\noften implicit restrictions of the notion of function to, e.g.,\nfunctions presented by familiar formulas, functions representable in\nintuition via their graphs, or functions decidable by a formal\nprocedure. In other words, he works with a generalized notion of\nfunction. In this respect he adopts, and expands on, the position of\nanother of his teachers: Dirichlet (Stein 1988, Ferreirós 1999,\nch. 7). Dedekind’s notion of set is general in the same sense. \nSuch generalized notions of set and function, together with the acceptance\nof the actual infinite, were soon attacked by\nfinitistically and constructively oriented mathematicians like\nKronecker. Dedekind defended his approach by pointing to its\nfruitfulness (Dedekind 1888a, first footnote, cf. Edwards 1983,\nFerreirós 1999, ch. 7). But eventually he came to see one\nfeature of it as problematic: his implicit acceptance of a general\ncomprehension principle (another sense in which his notion of set is\nunrestricted). We already touched on a specific way in which this\ncomes up in Dedekind’s work. Namely, in Was sind und was sollen\ndie Zahlen? he introduces “the totality of all things that\ncan be objects of my thought” (his “universal set”),\ntogether with arbitrary subsets of that totality (a general\nAussonderungsaxiom is used). But then, any collection of\nobjects counts as a set. \nAs just noted, Dedekind goes beyond considering only sets of numbers\nin his 1888 essay. This is a significant extension of the notion of\nset, or of its application, an extension about which one might be\nconcerned. An even more worrisome aspect consists of the particular\nway in which Dedekind’s all-encompassing totality is introduced,\nnamely by reference to “human thought”, since this leads\nto the question of whether crude psychologistic features are involved\n(more on that topic in Section 3). But the most problematic\nfeature—and the one Dedekind came to take seriously\nhimself—is a third one: his set theory is subject to the\nset-theoretic antinomies, including Russell’s antinomy. (If any\ncollection of objects counts as a set, then also Russell’s collection\nof all sets that do not contain themselves, and this leads quickly to\na contradiction.) Dedekind seems to have found out about such problems\nfrom Cantor in the late 1890s (who informed him that the collection of\nall ordinal numbers is an “inconsistent totality”, as is\nthe collection of all “objects of thought”). This news\nshocked him initially, so much that he delayed republication of\nWas sind und was sollen die Zahlen?; he even expressed doubts\nabout “whether human thinking is fully rational” (Dedekind\n1930–32, Vol. 3, p. 449, Dedekind 1996a, p. 836). Later he\nregained belief in the “inner harmony” of his approach,\nbut without providing a solution to these problems himself (Dedekind\n1930–32, Vol. 3, p. 343, Preface to the third edition, published in\n1911). \nRussell’s antinomy and related ones establish that Dedekind’s original\nconception of set is untenable. Yet they do not invalidate his other\ncontributions to set theory. His analysis of continuity, the use of\nDedekind cuts in the introduction of the real numbers, the definition\nof being Dedekind-infinite, the formulation of the Dedekind-Peano\naxioms, the proof of their categoricity, the analysis of the natural\nnumbers as finite ordinal numbers, the justification of mathematical\ninduction and recursion, and most basically, the insistence on\nextensional, general notions of set and function, as well as the\nacceptance of the actual infinite—all of these contributions can\nbe isolated from the set-theoretic antinomies. As such, they have been\nbuilt into the very core of axiomatic set theory, model theory,\nrecursion theory, and other parts of current logic. \nAnd there are further contributions to set theory we owe to Dedekind.\nSome of these do not appear in his published writings, but in his\ncorrespondence. Especially significant is his exchange of letters,\nstarting in 1872, with Cantor (Noether & Cavaillès 1937,\nMeschkowski & Nilson 1991). These letters contain a discussion of\nCantor’s and Dedekind’s respective treatments of the real numbers.\nBeyond that, they amount to a joint exploration of the notions of set\nand infinity. Among Dedekind’s specific contributions in this context\nare the following: He impresses Cantor with a proof that not only the\nset of rational numbers but also the set of all algebraic numbers is\ncountable (Ferreirós 1999, ch. 6). This result led, at least in\npart, to Cantor’s further study of infinite cardinalities and to his\ndiscovery, soon thereafter, that the set of all real numbers is not\ncountable. Dedekind also provides a proof of\nthe Cantor-Bernstein Theorem (that between any two sets which can be\nembedded one-to-one into each other there exists a bijection, so that\nthey have the same cardinality). This is another basic result in the\ntheory of transfinite cardinals (Ferreirós 1999, ch. 7). \nFinally, in the development of set theory during the twentieth century\nit became clear that several of Dedekind’s results and procedures can\nbe generalized in important ways. Perhaps most significantly, Zermelo\nand von Neumann succeeded in extending his analysis of mathematical\ninduction and recursion to the higher infinite, thus expanding on, and\nestablishing more firmly, Cantor’s theory of transfinite ordinals and\ncardinals. Looking back on all of these contributions, it is no wonder\nthat Zermelo—who knew the relevant history well—considered\nthe modern theory of sets as having been “created by Cantor and\nDedekind” (quoted in Ferreirós 2016b). \nSo far we have focused on Dedekind’s contributions in his overtly\nfoundational writings. We reviewed his innovative approaches to the\nnatural and real numbers; we also reconsidered his role in the rise of\nmodern set theory. Along the way, some philosophical issues have come\nup. A more extended reflection on them seems called for, however,\nespecially concerning Dedekind’s \n“logicism” and\n“structuralism” \n(both topics that have led to some controversies in the\nsecondary literature, as already indicated parenthetically). \nLike for Frege, the other main logicist in the nineteenth century,\n“logic” is \nmore encompassing for Dedekind than often\nassumed today (as comprising only first-order logic). Both thinkers\ntake the notions of object, set, and function to be fundamental for\nhuman thought and, as such, to fall within the range of logic. Each of\nthem then develops a version of set theory (a theory of\n“systems”, “extensions”, or\n“classes”) \nseen as part of logic. Also for both, logic in\nthis encompassing sense is independent of intuitive considerations\nand, specifically, of traditional Euclidean geometry (understood to be \ngrounded in pure or empirical intuition). A main goal in reducing\nanalysis and arithmetic to logic is, thus, to establish that those\nfields too are independent of intuition (cf. Demopoulos & \nClark 2005). \nThe view that analysis is not dependent on geometry, since it falls\nwithin the realm of arithmetical and basic logical thought, was not\nentirely new at the time—Gauss and Dirichlet already held such a\nview, as mentioned above (cf. also Ferreirós 2007). What\nFrege’s and Dedekind’s new contributions consisted in were original,\ndetailed reductions of, on the one hand, analysis to arithmetic and,\non the other hand, arithmetic to logic. Moreover, each of them\ncomplemented these reductions with systematic elaborations of logic.\nAs Dedekind’s work was better known than Frege’s at the time, probably\nbecause of his greater reputation as a mathematician, he was seen as\nthe main representative of \n“logicism” \nby interested contemporaries, such as C.S. Pierce, Ernst \nSchröder, and David Hilbert (cf. \nFerreirós 1999, ch. 7, \nFerreirós 2009). \nIn addition to these general commonalities in Dedekind’s and Frege’s\nversions of logicism, the two thinkers also agreed on a methodological\nprinciple encapsulated in the following remark by Dedekind: In\nscience, and especially in mathematics, “nothing capable of\nproof ought to be accepted without proof” (Dedekind 1888a,\npreface). This principle ought to be adhered to not so much because it\nincreases certainty. Rather, it is often only by providing an\nexplicit, detailed proof for a result that the assumptions on which it\ndepends become evident and, thus, its range of applicability\nestablished. Both Frege and Dedekind had learned that lesson from the\nhistory of mathematics, especially developments in geometry, algebra,\nand the calculus (see Reck 2013, building on Wilson 1992,\n2010, Tappenden 1995, 2006, Ferreirós 1999, and Detlefen\n2011). \nBesides where they are in agreement, it is instructive to consider\nsome of the differences between Dedekind and Frege too. First and put\nin modern terminology, a major difference is that, while Frege’s main\ncontributions to logic concern syntactic, proof-theoretic aspects,\nDedekind tends to focus on semantic, model-theoretic aspects. Thus,\nnothing like Frege’s revolutionary analysis of deductive inference, by\nmeans of his “Begriffsschrift”, \ncan be found in Dedekind’s\nworks. Dedekind, in turn, is much more explicit and clear than Frege\nabout issues such as categoricity, completeness, independence, etc. \nThis allows, among others, to\nsee him as a precursor of the “formal \naxiomatic” approach\nchampioned later by Hilbert and Bernays (Hallett 1994, 1995, Sieg\n& Schlimm 2005, 2014, Sieg 2010, 2014). \nCompared to Frege, Dedekind also has much more to say about the\ninfinite, not just by formulating a definition of that notion, but\nalso by exploring the possibility of different infinite cardinalities\nwith Cantor. And he shows more awareness of the challenge posed by\nKroneckerian computational and constructivist strictures to logicism.\nThe differences between Frege’s and Dedekind’s respective treatments\nof the natural and real numbers are noteworthy too. As we saw,\nDedekind conceives of the natural numbers primarily as ordinal\nnumbers; he also identifies them purely \n“structurally”.\nFrege makes their application as cardinal numbers central; and he\ninsists on building this application into the very nature of the\nnatural numbers, thus endowing them with non-structural,\n“intrinsic” properties. \nThe case of the real numbers\nillustrates this divergence further. Finally, Frege’s and Dedekind’s\nunderlying conceptions of logic and language differ significantly. \n(The latter is one of the main reasons for why Dedekind is not \ninterpreted as a logicist in Sinaceur 2008, 2015,\n2017.) \nApart from Frege, it is illuminating to compare Dedekind’s approach\nmore with later set-theoretic ones. We noted in the last section that\nmany of his innovations have been built into axiomatic set theory. Yet\nhere too, several differences emerge if one looks more closely. To\nbegin with, Dedekind does not start with an axiom of infinity as a\nfundamental principle; instead, he tries to prove the existence of\ninfinite sets. This can be seen as another application of the\nmethodological rule to prove everything “capable of\nproof”, as well as a crucial aspect of his logicism. \nHowever, few set theorists today will want to go back to this aspect of Dedekind’s\napproach. (Dedekind’s argument in this connection is similar to an\nearlier one in Bolzano’s posthumously published work; cf.\nFerreirós 1999, ch. 7, Klev 2019.)  \nA second marked difference between Dedekind and current set theory has\nalready come up too, but deserves further comment. This is his appeal\nto “abstraction”, and \n“creation”,\nin the last step of his introduction of both the natural and the real\nnumbers (“Dedekind-abstraction”, \nas it is called in Tait 1996). For the real numbers, the\nstandard procedure in axiomatic set theory is to follow Dedekind up to\nthis last step, but then to work with the Dedekind-cuts themselves as\n“the real numbers”. \nWhile aware of this option (Dedekind 1876b, 1888b), Dedekind tells us to \napply “abstraction” to\nthe cuts insofar as they consist of complex sets, thus to\n“create” additional \nmathematical objects determined by\nbut not identical with them. Likewise, in the case of the natural\nnumbers it is standard today to construct a particular simple\ninfinity, usually the set of finite von Neumann ordinals, and then to\nidentify the natural numbers with them (thus: \\(0 = \\emptyset\\), \\(1 =\n\\{0\\}\\), \\(2 = \\{0, 1\\}\\), etc.). Once again, the step involving\n“abstraction” and “creation” of Dedekind’s\nprocedure is avoided by such identification. \nIn current approaches it is sometimes added that any other\nset-theoretically constructed system that is isomorphic to the system\nof Dedekind cuts or to the system of finite von Neumann ordinals,\nrespectively, would do as well, i.e. be usable mathematically as\n“the real numbers” or “the natural numbers”\nfor most practical purposes. This means that contemporary set theory\nis, often implicitly and without further elaboration, supplemented by\na “set-theoretic structuralist” \nview about the nature of\nmathematical objects (Reck & Price 2000). The resulting\nphilosophical position is different from Dedekind’s. (But see again\nSieg & Morris 2018; in it Dedekind is interpreted as \nchanging his position over time, i.e., as having adopted a position close to\nset-theoretic structuralism by 1888.) Nor does Dedekind’s position\ncoincide with several other forms of structuralism prominent in\ncontemporary philosophy of mathematics, e.g., those defended by\nGeoffrey Hellman, Michael Resnik, and Stewart Shapiro. \nWhy do most mathematicians and philosophers not follow Dedekind more\nclosely in this respect? Here the following difficulties play a role\n(cf. Boolos 1990, Müller-Stach 2017, among others): How exactly\nshould his notions of “abstraction” and\n“creation” be understood, if they can be made sense of at\nall? And why did Dedekind insist on their use in the first place,\nsince we seem to be able to do without them as axiomatic set theory\nshows? A partial answer to the latter question is: For Dedekind, the\nreal numbers should not be identified with the corresponding cuts\nbecause those cuts have “wrong properties”; namely, as\nsets they contain elements, something that seems “foreign”\nto the real numbers themselves. Similarly, the natural numbers should\nnot be ascribed set-theoretic or other “foreign”\nproperties; they too should be conceived of “purely\narithmetically” (see again Dedekind 1876b, 1888b). Can anything\nfurther be said in this connection? \nBy philosophical critics, Dedekind’s procedure is often interpreted as\nfollows: As his language of “abstraction” \nand “creation” \nsuggests, he is appealing to psychological\nprocesses. And the resulting entities—“the real\nnumber” and “the natural numbers”—must then be\npsychological or mental entities (existing in people’s subjective\nconsciousness). If that was correct, his position would amount to a form of\npsychologism about mathematics that is deeply problematic, as Frege,\nHusserl, and others have taught us (cf. Dummett 1995). Partly to avoid\nsuch a damning conclusion, partly to attribute more philosophical\ndepth to Dedekind, the following reply can be found in the literature:\nWhile he does not say so explicitly, Dedekind’s\npsychologistic-sounding language indicates a commitment to Kantian\nassumptions, in particular to Kant’s transcendental psychology\n(Kitcher 1986, McCarty 1995, Klev 2019, cf. also Benis-Sinaceur 2008,\n2015, 2018, Floyd 2013). Then again, it is not clear that this takes\ncare of the psychologism charge fully (often also directed against\nKant), so that such a response would have to be spelled out further\n(cf. Yap 2017, Reck 2020, building on Cassirer 1907,\n1910). In itself, it also leaves unexplained the precise form of\nDedekind’s “abstraction”. \nRecently another suggestion for how to get clearer about the nature of\n“Dedekind abstraction” \nand, at the same time, avoid crude\nforms of psychologism has become prominent. Namely, instead of taking\nsuch abstraction to amount to a psychological process, it should be\nunderstood as a logical procedure (cf. Tait 1996, earlier Cassirer 1910). \nConsider again the case of the natural\nnumbers, where Dedekind is most explicit about this issue. What we are\nprovided with by him is this: First, the language and logic to be used\nare specified, thus the kinds of assertions and arguments that can be\nmade concerning the natural numbers; second, a particular simple\ninfinity is constructed; third, this simple infinity is used to\ndetermine the truth values of all arithmetic sentences (by equating\nthem with the truth values of corresponding sentences for the given\nsimple infinity); and fourth, this determination is justified by\nshowing that all simple infinities are isomorphic (so that, if a\nsentence holds for one of them, it holds for all). \nThe core of the procedure just described is the following: Something\nis true for the natural numbers exactly when the corresponding\nstatement holds for all simple infinities (i.e., is a semantic\nconsequence of the Dedekind-Peano axioms). What, then, are the natural\nnumbers? They are those mathematical objects whose properties are\ndetermined by all arithmetic truths; we “abstract\naway” from everything else in terms of a logical procedure.\nMoreover, this procedure can be spelled out, precisely and consistently, in terms of\n“structural abstraction principles” \n(cf. Linnebo &\nPettigrew 2014, Reck 2018 for details). Along such lines, all that\nmatters about mathematical objects, indeed all that is built into\ntheir identity and nature, is what the corresponding mathematical\ntruths determine. Consequently, it is by specifying those truths that\nwe “create”, or better \nfully characterize, them. The\nresulting position seems clearly not psychologistic, and it might be\ncalled “logical \nstructuralism” (Reck 2003, Yap 2009a). \nInterpreted as such, Dedekind’s approach is related to that of the\n“American Postulate Theorists”, \nE. Huntington, O. Veblen,\netc. (cf. Awodey & Reck 2002).\nThere is also a close connection to, and a clear influence on, the\nformal axiomatics developed by Hilbert and Bernays later (cf. Sieg\n2010, 2014, also Hallett 1994, 1995, 2003). For all of these thinkers,\nwhat is crucial in, and sufficient for, mathematics is that the\ncompleteness and consistency of certain basic concepts, or of the\ncorresponding systems of axioms, are established. In Dedekind’s case,\ncompleteness is to be understood in a semantic sense, as based on\ncategoricity; likewise, consistency is to be understood semantically,\nas satisfiability (Dedekind 1890); and both are tied to his distinctive\ncombination of logicism and structuralism. \nThe syntactic study of such issues, especially of consistency, that\nbecame a core part of Hilbertian “proof theory” is not\npresent in Dedekind’s work. As already noted, the proof-theoretic side\nof logic is not pursued much by him. Nor is the “finitism”\ncharacteristic of Hilbert & Bernays’ later work present in\nDedekind (an aspect developed in response to the set-theoretic\nantinomies and to intuitionist challenges), especially if it is\nunderstood in a metaphysical sense. Such finitism might have been\nacceptable to Dedekind as a methodological stance, but in other\nrespects his position is strongly infinitary. In fact, the finite is\nexplained in terms of the infinite in his work: the notion of finitude\nby that of infinity, the natural numbers in terms of infinite sets,\netc. (cf. Hilbert 1922). \nThe summary of Dedekind’s position in this section highlighted logical\nissues (his basic logical notions and procedures, compared both to\nFrege and to axiomatic set theory) and metaphysical issues\n(Dedekindian abstraction and creation, the structural nature of\nmathematical objects). However, there is another dimension of his\nposition—another sense in which Dedekind’s approach represents a\nunique combination of logicism and structuralism—that deserves\nphilosophical attention. That side involves primarily methodological\nand epistemological aspects. Some of those aspects already played a\nrole in our discussions of his overtly foundational writings; but in\norder to shed more light on them, it helps to turn to his other\nmathematical work, starting with algebraic number theory. \nWhile historians of mathematics have long emphasized the influence\nthat Dedekind’s contributions to algebraic number theory had on the\ndevelopment of twentieth-century mathematics, the philosophical\nsignificance of these contributions has only started to be probed\nrecently (with some early exceptions: Dugac 1976, Sinaceur 1979,\nEdwards 1980, 1983, Stein 1988). We should begin here by reviewing two\nrelated aspects: the roots of Dedekind’s number-theoretic\ninvestigations in the works of Gauss, Dirichlet, and Ernst Kummer; and\nthe contrast between Dedekind’s approach and that of Leopold\nKronecker. \nThe starting point for these number theorists is the solution of\nalgebraic equations, especially their solution in terms of integers. A\nfamous example is Fermat’s Last Theorem, which concerns the\n(non-)solubility of the equation \\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) by integers, for\ndifferent exponents \\(n\\). The approach to the problem developed by\nGauss, clarified and refined by Dirichlet, and pushed further by\nKummer involves considering extensions of the (field of) rational\nnumbers, as well as of the (ring of) “integers” contained\nin such extensions. Thus, Gauss studied the “Gaussian\nintegers” (\\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are regular\nintegers and \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\)) within the field of all complex\nnumbers; Kummer considered more complicated “cyclotomic\nintegers” in corresponding cyclotomic number fields (Edwards\n1977, Stillwell 2000, Gray 2018). \nWhat became clear along such lines is that in some of these extensions\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic—asserting the unique\nfactorization of all integers into powers of primes—fails. If it\nhad been available generally, solutions to important problems would\nhave been within reach, including Fermat’s Last Theorem. The question\nbecame, then, whether a suitable alternative to the Fundamental\nTheorem could be found. Kummer’s response, obtained in a close study\nof certain particular cases, was to introduce “ideal\ndivisors” in terms of which unique factorization could be\nrecovered. While this move led to striking progress, the precise\nnature of these new mathematical objects was left unclear, as were the\nbasis for their introduction and the range of applicability of the\ntechnique. \nBoth Dedekind and Kronecker knew this earlier work well, especially\nKummer’s, and they tried to build on it. Kronecker’s strategy was to\nexamine in concrete detail, and by exploiting computational aspects,\ncertain kinds of extensions. Crucial for him was to proceed\nfinitistically and constructively, thus in a self-consciously\nrestricted way. This led to his “divisor theory”, an\nextension of Gauss’ and Kummer’s “theory of forms”\n(Edwards 1980, 1990). Dedekind, in contrast, approached the issue in a\nmore encompassing and abstract way. He considered algebraic number\nfields in general, thereby introducing the notion of a\n“field” for the first time (Edwards 1983, Haubrich 1992,\nStillwell 1996, 1999, Ullrich 2017, Gray 2018). \nDedekind also replaced Kummer’s “ideal \nnumbers” by his\n“ideals”—set-theoretically constructed objects\nintended to play the same role with respect to unique factorization.\nDedekindian ideals are infinite subsets of the number fields in\nquestion, or of the ring of integers contained in them, which again\ngives his approach an infinitary character. (An ideal I in a\nring R is a subset such that the sum and difference of any\ntwo elements of I and the product of any element of\nI with any element of R are also in I.)\nThis led him to introduce other fruitful notions as well, such as that of a\n“module”. A particular \nproblem Dedekind struggled with for\nquite a while, in the sense of finding a fully satisfactory solution,\nwas to specify a suitable version, not only of the notion of\n“integer”, but also of “prime number”\n(Ferreirós 1999, ch. 3, Avigad 2006, Haffner 2014). \nBoth Kronecker, with his divisor theory, and Dedekind, with his ideal\ntheory, were able to obtain important results. Each theory also had a\nstrong influence on later developments—Dedekind’s by shaping the\napproaches to modern algebra (field theory, ring theory, etc.) of\nHilbert, Emmy Noether, B.L. van der Waerden, Emil Artin, Nicolas\nBourbaki, and others (Alten et al. 2003, Corry 2004, McLarty 2006,\nGray 2008, 2018); Kronecker’s by influencing Hilbert’s work as well,\nand by being revived later in, among others, André Weil’s and\nAlexander Grothendieck’s work (class field theory, algebraic geometry)\n(Weil 1950, Edwards 1990, Reed 1995, Corfield 2003). The contrast\nbetween their approaches provides a clear example—historically\nthe first significant example—of the opposition between\n“classical” and “constructivist” conceptions\nof mathematics. \nNot infrequently this opposition is debated in terms of which approach\nis “the right one”, \nwith the implication that only one of\nthem but not the other is legitimate. (This started with Dedekind and\nKronecker. We already noted that Dedekind explicitly rejected\nconstructivist strictures on his work, although he did not rule out\ncorresponding projects as illegitimate in themselves. Kronecker, with\nhis strong opposition to the use of set-theoretic and infinitary\ntechniques, went further in the other direction.) But another question\nis more basic: Can the contrast between the two approaches to\nalgebraic number theory, or to mathematics more generally, be captured\nmore sharply and insightfully; and in particular, what is its\nmethodological and epistemological significance? \nAn initial, rough answer to that question is already contained in our\ndiscussion so far: Dedekind’s approach is set-theoretic and\ninfinitary, while Kronecker’s is constructivist and finitary. However,\nthat leaves us with a deeper issue: What exactly is it that a\nset-theoretic and infinitary methodology allows us to accomplish that\nKronecker’s doesn’t, and vice versa? The specific strength of\na Kroneckerian approach is often summed up thus: It provides us with\ncomputational, algorithmic information (Edwards 1980, 1990, Avigad\n2008). But what is the characteristic virtue of a Dedekindian\napproach? Here an informative and articulate answer is harder to find,\nespecially one that is philosophically satisfying. \nWhat tends to get in the way is that the set-theoretic and infinitary\nmethodology Dedekind championed was so successful, and shaped\ntwentieth-century mathematics so much, that it is hard to reach the\nanalytic distance needed. Often all one gets, then, are platitudes:\nthat it is very “general” and “abstract”. Or\none is left with negative characterizations: that it fails to be\nfinitistically and constructively acceptable. Beyond that, there is\nthe suggestion that Dedekind’s approach is\n“structuralist”. \nBut as this term is now used to\ncharacterize a methodology, rather than a metaphysical position, one\nwonders what exactly it involves. Before attempting a clarification and\nelaboration, let us briefly consider some of Dedekind’s other\nmathematical works, since this will make certain crucial features\nstand out more. \nFor our purposes, three additional areas in which Dedekind applied his\nset-theoretic, infinitary, and structuralist approach are relevant:\nthe theory of algebraic functions, group theory, and lattice\ntheory. \nDedekind realized early on that several of the notions and techniques\nhe had introduced in algebraic number theory could be transferred to\nthe study of algebraic functions (algebraic function fields, in later\nterminology), especially the set-theoretic introduction of ideals and\nways of calculating with them (cf. Haffner 2014, 2015, 2017 for\nemphasizing the latter). This realization came to fruition in\n“Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen einer\nVeränderlichen”, \na substantive article co-written with\nHeinrich Weber and published in 1882. The approach in it led, among\nothers, to a better understanding of Riemann surfaces, including a\npurely algebraic proof of the celebrated Riemann-Roch Theorem (Geyer\n1981, Kolmogorov & Yushkevich 2001, ch. 2, Stillwell 2012). As\nthese were issues of wide interest among mathematicians, the success\ngave Dedekind’s approach significant legitimacy and publicity (cf.\nEdwards 1983, Dieudonné 1985). \nSecond, Dedekind’s contributions to algebraic number theory were\nconnected, in a natural and fruitful way, with Evariste Galois’\nrevolutionary group-theoretic approach to algebra. In fact, Dedekind’s\nearly and systematic study of Galois theory—he was \nthe first to lecture on it at a German university, already during his time as a\nPrivatdozent in Göttingen—led \nto a transformation\nof that theory itself. It turned from the study of substitutions in\nformulas and of functions invariant under such substitutions into the\nstudy of field extensions and corresponding automorphisms, which deep\nconnections to algebraic number theory (Mehrtens 1979b, Stein 1988,\nFerreirós & Reck 2020). \nDedekind also introduced additional\napplications of Galois theory, e.g., in the study of modular equations\nand functions (Gray 2000, ch. 4, Alten et al. 2003, ch. 8). \nAs a third spin-off, Dedekind’s number-theoretic investigations led to\nthe introduction of the notion of a “lattice” (under the\nname “Dualgruppe”). He examined that notion\nfurther, also as a topic in itself, in two relatively late articles:\n“Über Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre größten\ngemeinsamen Teiler” (1897) and “Über die von drei\nModuln erzeugte Dualgruppe” (1900). While these articles did not\nhave the same immediate and strong impact that several of his other\npublications had, they were later recognized as original, systematic\ncontributions to lattice theory, especially to the study of modular\nlattices (Mehrtens 1979a, ch. 2, Burris 1983, Alten et al. 2003, ch.\n10) and to an axiomatic approach to mathematics more generally\n(Schlimm 2000, 2011, 2017). \nNone of these contributions by Dedekind can be treated in any detail\nhere (and various others have to be ignored completely), but some\ngeneral observations about them can be made. While they again\nexemplify a set-theoretic and infinitary perspective, they also\ndisplay the following related features: the focus on entire systems of\nobjects and on general laws for them; the move away from particular\nformulas, or from particular symbolic representations, to more general\ncharacterizations of the underlying systems of objects, specifically\nin terms of relational and functional properties; the consideration of\nhomomorphisms, automorphisms, isomorphisms, and features invariant\nunder such mappings; and the investigation of novel, abstract\nconcepts, introduced in connection with specific cases but then\nstudied in themselves. \nThese features are, in fact, characteristic for Dedekind’s works\noverall, including his studies in algebraic number theory and his\nfoundational investigations. It is by taking them into account that\ncalling his methodology, not just “general” \nand “abstract”, but “structuralist” starts to\nacquire further content. It also helps us to recognized in which way\nDedekind’s approach played a crucial role in the emergence of\n“modern” mathematics, as shaped by a structuralist\nmethodology (cf. Reck & Schiemer 2020). Looking back on the\ncorresponding history of algebra, B.L. van der Waerden, himself a\nmajor contributor to this field, concluded: “It was Evariste\nGalois and Richard Dedekind who gave modern algebra its structure;\nthat is where its weight-bearing skeleton comes from” (Dedekind\n1964, foreword, quoted in Mehrtens 1979b; cf. also Gray 2008). \nIn earlier sections we considered Dedekind’s overtly foundational\nworks. This led to a discussion of the logicist and metaphysical\nstructuralist views emerging in them. In the last few sections, the\nfocus shifted to his other mathematical contributions and the\nmethodological structuralism they embody. Now we are in a position to\nprovide a more explicit and systematic elaboration of the latter.\nBeyond just calling Dedekind’s approach set-theoretic, infinitary, and\nnon-constructive, the methodology that informs it can be analyzed as\nconsisting of three parts. \nThe first part is closely tied to Dedekind’s employment of\nset-theoretic tools and techniques. He uses these to construct new\nmathematical objects (the natural and real numbers, ideals, modules,\netc.) or whole classes of such objects (algebraic number fields,\nrings, lattices, etc.), usually in terms of infinite sets. Closely\nrelated but even more characteristic, both in foundational and other\ncontexts, is the following: These sets are then endowed with general\nstructural features (order relations, arithmetic and other operations,\netc.); and the resulting systems are studied in terms of corresponding\nhigher-level concepts (continuity for the real number system, simple\ninfinity for the natural numbers, unique factorization in algebraic\nnumber fields and function fields, etc.). Once more, philosophically\nrelevant is not just that this procedure is infinitary (his acceptance\nof actual infinities) and non-constructive (the added features are not\nnecessarily grounded in algorithms). A whole variety of relational\nsystems, including many new ones, can now be investigated; and this\nbrings with it a significant extension of the subject matter of\nmathematics. Mathematics is no longer tied to what is given\nintuitively or even empirically (concrete numbers of things, geometric\nmagnitudes, physical processes that are observable, etc.); it has\nbecome the study of relational systems much more generally (based on a\nnew “logic of relations”, \nas Russell and Cassirer will later put it). \nThe second characteristic part of Dedekind’s methodology consists of\npersistently (and from early on, cf. Dedekind 1854) attempting to\nidentify and clarify fundamental concepts, including the higher-level\nconcepts just mentioned (continuity, infinity, generalized concepts \nof integer and of prime number, also the\nnew concepts of ideal, module, lattice, etc.). In this context, it is\ncrucial for him to find “the right \ndefinitions”; and this\ninvolves not just basic adequacy, but also desiderata such as:\nfruitfulness, generality, simplicity, and \n“purity”, i.e.,\nthe elimination of “foreign” \naspects. (Geometric notions\nare foreign to the natural and real numbers, the definition of prime\nnumber must be at just the right level of generality, etc.). Moreover,\nonce Dedekind has identified them, he studies the most important ones\nalso in themselves, i.e., in terms of a separate part of the theory.\nThis gives his approach a distinctive \n“conceptual”\ncharacter (cf. Stein 1988, Avigad 2006), and it points forward\ntowards an axiomatic approach (Sieg & Schlimm 2014, Schlimm 2017,\nalso Haffner 2014, 2015, 2017) \nThe third main part of Dedekind’s approach connects and complements\nthe first two. Not only does he study infinite systems of objects or\nwhole classes of such systems; and not only does he attempt to\nidentify basic concepts applicable to them, especially higher-level\nconcepts. He also tends to do both, often in conjunction, by\nconsidering mappings on the systems studied, especially\nstructure-preserving mappings (homomorphisms, isomorphisms, implicitly\nalso category-theoretic functors, etc.). This implies that what is\ncrucial about a mathematical phenomenon may not lie on the surface\n(concrete features of examples, particular symbolisms, etc.) but go\ndeeper. And while the deeper features are often captured\nset-theoretically (Dedekind cuts, ideals, quotient structures, etc.),\nthis points beyond set theory in the end, towards category theory,\nespecially in Dedekind’s later works (Corry 2004, McLarty 2006,\nFerreirós 2017a, 2017b). \nThese three parts of Dedekind’s approach may not seem extraordinary to\na contemporary mathematician. But that is just testimony to how much\nmodern mathematics has been shaped by his work. His approach was\ncertainly seen as novel, even revolutionary, at the time. Some\nnegative reactions to it, by finitist and constructivist thinkers,\nhave already been mentioned. The extent to which Dedekind’s approach\ndiverged from what had been common stands out further if we remember\ntwo traditional, widely shared assumptions: that mathematics is the\nscience of number and magnitude; and that it has essentially to do\nwith calculating and other algorithmic procedures. Relative to such\nassumptions, Dedekind’s approach to mathematics involves a radical\ntransformation and liberation (Stein 1988, Tait 1996). \nAnother way to bring out the radical character of Dedekind’s work is\nby returning to his treatment of the infinite. It starts with taking\nwhat was long seen as a paradoxical property (to be equinumerous with\na proper subset) to be a defining characteristic of infinite sets.\nDedekind then adds a systematic and wide-ranging analysis of the\nfinite in terms of the infinite, again a rather bold idea. For\nconceptual and methodological innovations like these to become\naccepted, they not only had to open up novel realms for mathematics;\nthe resulting approach also had to lead to progress\nin more traditional realms (as it did: the clarification of continuity\nand of mathematical induction and recursion, results in algebra,\nalgebraic number theory, the theory of algebraic functions, etc.). \nWhile Dedekind was a great innovator, he was, of course, not alone in\nmoving large parts of mathematics in a set-theoretic, infinitary, and\nstructuralist direction. There was a whole group of \nmathematicians who promoted a more\n“conceptual” \napproach at the time, including several of\nhis teachers in Göttingen. Within that group, Dirichlet has\nsometimes been picked out as the leader, or the “poet’s\npoet”, among others by being a big influence on Dedekind (Stein\n1988, see also Merzbach 2018). As\nHermann Minkowski, a major figure in this tradition himself, put it\nlater (on the occasion of Dirichlet’s 100th birthday): he impressed on\nother mathematicians “to conquer the problems with a minimum\namount of blind calculation, a maximum of clear-seeing thought”\n(quoted in Stein 1988). \nRiemann was another influential figure in this context. He too had a\nstrong influence on Dedekind, in two ways: by emphasizing (in his\ndevelopment of complex function theory) the importance of using\nsimple, characteristic, and \n“intrinsic” concepts, in\ncontrast to “extrinsic” \nproperties tied to, say,\nparticular symbolisms (Mehrtens 1979b, Laugwitz 1999, Tappenden 2005a,\n2006, Ferreirós & Reck 2020); \nand by exploring new\n“conceptual possibilities”, \nincluding the systematic study\nof Riemannian geometries (Stein 1988). A further example of such\nconceptual exploration, again very familiar to Dedekind, was the study\nof transfinite ordinal and cardinal numbers by his correspondent\nCantor (Ferreirós 1999, chs. 2 and 6). And of course, later\nmathematicians influenced by Dirichlet, Riemann, Dedekind, and Cantor\npushed their innovations further, including Ernst Zermelo, Emmy\nNoether, and Nicolas Bourbaki (Corry 2004, 2017, McLarty 2006, Kahle\n2017). \nCan the significance of Dedekind’s methodology be brought out even\nfurther? Or can it be articulated more in different terms? One way to\ndo the latter, already touched on above, is by highlighting the\nmethodological values embodied in it: systematicity, generality,\npurity, etc. (Avigad 2006, also Haffner 2014, 2015, 2017). Another is\nby focusing on the kind of reasoning involved:\n“conceptual” or “structural” reasoning (Stein\n1988, Ferreirós 1999), or in\nterminology often associated with Hilbert, \n“axiomatic”\nreasoning (Sieg & Schlimm 2005, 2017, Schlimm 2000, 2011, 2017).\nWe might even want to talk about a novel “reasoning \nstyle”\nin this connection, where “style” \nis to be understood in\nan epistemological sense, not in an aesthetic, psychological, or\nsociological sense. Such a style brings with it, not just new theorems\nand proofs, but a distinctive kind of “understanding” of\nmathematical facts (Reck 2009, cf. also Tappenden 2005b,\nMüller-Stach 2017). \nThese attempts to reveal the full significance of Dedekind’s approach\nare initial forays and in need of further elaboration. However, one\naspect seems clear enough: The methodological and epistemological\nperspective that shapes Dedekind’s mathematical works is not\nindependent of the logical and metaphysically views emerging in his\nmore foundational writings. This is no accident; if one adopts his\nmethodological stance, it is hardly possible to hold on to narrowly\ncomputational, formalist, empiricist, or intuitionist views about\nmathematics. More specifically, a structuralist methodology along\nDedekindian lines calls for a structuralist metaphysics, as two sides\nof the same coin. Dedekind seems to have been keenly aware of this\nfact, even if he did not elaborate it much in his writings. \nWe started out by considering Dedekind’s contributions to the\nfoundations of mathematics in his overtly foundational writings: the\ntwo booklets, Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen (1872) and\nWas sind und was sollen die Zahlen? (1888). We then added a\nsketch and preliminary analysis of the methodological innovations in\nhis more mainstream mathematical writings, from his work in algebraic\nnumber theory to other areas. We also noted that the logical and\nmetaphysical position in his foundational work is closely tied to his\nmore general methodological and epistemological perspective. In this\nsense, any attempt to distinguish sharply between his\n“foundational” and his \nother “mathematical”\nwritings is misguided; Dedekind made foundationally relevant\ncontributions throughout his work. In fact, his case provides a good\nargument and illustration for a more general lesson. Namely, any\nstrict distinction between \n“foundational” or\n“philosophical” \nquestions about mathematics, on the one hand, and \n“inner-mathematical” or\n“practice-based” questions, \non the other hand, is\ncounterproductive in the end, especially if one does not want to\nimpoverish both sides. \nIf we look at Dedekind’s contributions from such a perspective, the\nsum total is impressive. He was not only one of the greatest\nmathematicians of the nineteenth century, but also one of its subtlest\nphilosophers of mathematics. With his structuralist views about the\nnature of mathematical entities and about how to investigate them, he\nwas far ahead of his time. He was even ahead of much current\nphilosophy of mathematics, especially with his sensitivity to both\nsides. This is not to say that his position is without problems.\nDedekind himself was troubled by the set-theoretic antinomies,\nespecially initially. And the twentieth century produced additional\nsurprises, such as Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, that \nare difficult to accommodate for everyone. Moreover, the methodology of\nmathematics has developed further since his time, including attempts\nto reconcile and integrate “conceptual” and\n“computational” thinking, e.g., \nin computer-assisted\nproofs. Then again, is there a philosophical position available today\nthat answers all important questions about mathematics in a\nsatisfactory way? If not, updating and reviving a Dedekindian position\nmay be a worthwhile project.","contact.mail":"erich.reck@ucr.edu","contact.domain":"ucr.edu"}]
