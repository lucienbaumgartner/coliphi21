But feminist philosophers\nare rarely wedded to one tradition over the other; quite the contrary:\ntheir work presents a good case for the theoretical advantages of\ncrossing the lines between analytic and continental philosophy and\nbetween the two branches of continental feminism. Indeed, feminists\noriented by German philosophical traditions are often closer to those\noriented by Anglo-American traditions than they are to those oriented\nby French ones. Moreover, both analytic and continental feminists look\nto the French philosopher, Simone de Beauvoir’s work and both find\ntheoretical resources in the works of J.L. Austin and Michel Foucault.\nAlthough this entry distinguishes broadly analytic and broadly\ncontinental feminist traditions, it also tries to clarify\nintersections, overlaps and the ways in which analytic and continental\nfeminists build on one another’s work. The entry focuses on\nthree topics common to the two traditions: problems of who or what\nwomen are, issues pertaining to freedom and domination, and questions\nof epistemic injustice.\n\nFor contemporary feminists, the question of who or what women are is\nnot easily answered. Both analytic and continental traditions find a\nclear articulation of the problem in Simone de Beauvoir’s 1949\nbook, The Second Sex where she famously claims that\n“One is not born, but rather becomes a woman” (1953, 281).\nElizabeth Spelman’s consideration of this claim (1988) can serve\nas a basis for the analytic tradition’s reflections on the\nquestion of who or what women are meant to be while Judith\nButler’s analysis (1990) can do the same for the continental\ntradition.  \nThe claim that “One is not born, but rather becomes a\nwoman” signals a distinction between sex, comprising physical\nand biological aspects of bodies, and gender, comprising learned\nbehaviors, attitudes and aspirations. While this distinction is\ncomplex and controversial enough (see the entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender)\n de Beauvoir’s claim also raises what are now termed\nintersectional issues. Spelman notes that in parts of The Second\nSex de Beauvoir recognizes that if one is not born but rather\nbecomes a woman, it is not the same to become a white woman as it is\nto become a black one, for example, and not the same to become a\nbourgeois woman as it is to become a proletarian one. Indeed, de\nBeauvoir bemoans the effect this difference has for women’s struggles\nfor freedom and equality. Women “live dispersed among the\nmales,” she writes, “attached through residence,\nhousework, economic condition, and social standing to certain men\n– fathers or husbands – more firmly than they are to other\nwomen. If they belong to the bourgeoisie, they feel solidarity with\nmen of that class, not with proletarian women; if they are white,\ntheir allegiance is to white men, not to Negro women” (1953,\nxix). Not only are women’s allegiances class and race bound but their\nclasses and races can lead to tensions and conflicts. Among other\nobservations De Beauvoir makes, Spelman notes, are that bourgeois\nwomen can be hostile to their working class male and female servants;\nthat upper-class girls are brought up to believe in their superiority\nto working class men and that during the American Civil War white\nSouthern women defended slavery even more fiercely than their male\ncounterparts.  \nIn other parts of The Second Sex, however, de Beauvoir\nignores the consequences of intersections of gender with class and\nrace, and talks about women in general. In this regard, Spelman points\nto her contrast between women, on the one hand, and proletarians,\naborigines, blacks and Jews, on the other, as well as to her\nascription of women’s failure historically to reject their\nsubordinate social position to the advantages they gain from their\nalliance with “a superior caste.” Here de Beauvoir seems\nto forget that many women are proletarians, aborigines, blacks and\nJews and she writes as if all women shared the same relation to the\ncast of white bourgeois men she calls the “superior\ncaste”(1953, xxi). Spelman also notes the contrast de Beauvoir\nsets up between men defined as citizens and women depicted as wives\n“shut up in the home;” the way she refers appreciatively\nto August Bebel’s comparison of women and the proletariat in his\nWomen under Socialism; the use she makes of Hegel’s\ndiscussion of the relationship between master and slave to describe\nthe relationship between men and women; and her comparison of\n“Negro slavery” with female slavery (Spelman 1988, 64–5).\n \nDe Beauvoir’s work thus contains a contradiction in its thinking about\nwomen: Sometimes it conceives of women as a homogenous group,\nuniformly subordinate to men, and sometimes it conceives of women as\n“dispersed,” with different relations of solidarity with,\nand subordination to, different groups of men. Both conceptions have\nproblems. In conceiving of women as dispersed according to race and\nclass de Beauvoir’s work raises the question of what similarities in\nexperience, interest or concern might underwrite feminist struggles.\nSally Haslanger calls this the commonality problem (2000, 37). What\nexperiences does a black Sudanese Muslim woman displaced by ethnic\ncleansing in Dafur share with the Queen of England (Mikkola 2007,\n363)? What connects white middle-class women pursuing professional\ncareers with, say, poorer women or women of color who may take over\ntheir domestic chores (Ehrenreich 2002)? Indeed, might interests in a\nliving wage by female childcare workers not oppose interests of more\nprivileged women in affordable day care (Collins 1998, 223)? Moreover,\nin conceiving of women as a homogeneous group and contrasting them to\nproletarians, aborigines, blacks and Jews de Beauvoir betrays her\nidentification of women in general with a certain group of women,\nnamely those that are not proletarian, aboriginal, black or Jewish.\nHaslanger calls this the normativity problem. Talk of women as a\nsingle group falsely generalizes the interests, characteristics and\nconcerns of specific women – mainly those that are middle-class,\nEuropean, white and heterosexual – and makes them the norm for\nall. \nKimberlé Crenshaw (1991) draws the consequences of this false\ngeneralization for combatting violence against African American women.\nCivil rights groups often downplay statistics about domestic violence\nin African American neighborhoods because they do not want to feed\nstereotypes about the violence of African American men. Likewise,\nfeminists often downplay the statistics because they do not want\ndomestic violence to appear to be simply a crime against women of\ncolor. To this extent, African American men are the norm for civil\nrights advocates and white women are the norm for women’s rights\nadvocates. Women of color simply disappear from view. \nIn making this point, Crenshaw underscores concerns about exclusion\nvoiced by the Combahee River Collective, founded in 1974 as well as by\nwriters such as bell hooks (1981, 7), Aída Hurtado (1989,\n849–50) and the contributors to such influential anthologies as\nThis Bridge Called My Back (Moraga and Anzaldua 1981) and\nAll the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us\nAre Brave: Black Women’s Studies (Hull, Scott and Smith 1982).\nThese concerns cannot be accommodated by what Chandra Mohanty calls\nthe “add and stir” approach (2003, 518), which tries to\ncounter the exclusion of many women but still takes the experiences of\nwhite European heterosexual women as the base while mixing in the\nexperiences of others, say, Indonesian Nike workers, as if they were\nmere seasoning. Nor can the concerns be accommodated by taking\nIndonesian Nike workers as normative for non-Western women any more\nthan the concerns of mid-twentieth century Parisian women can be taken\nas normative for Western ones (2003, 34). \nAnn Garry (2011) looks to a Wittgensteinian family resemblance\nanalysis. We can give up on the existence of some property,\nexperience, or interest that all women share without giving up on\noverlapping and crisscrossing characteristics that become clear within\nspecific social contexts. For her part, Haslanger proposes an\n“ameliorative” concept of women, one that can help with\nattempts to end sexist oppression. If gender cannot be defined in\nterms of characteristics or concerns common to members of a particular\ngender, she thinks it can nonetheless be defined “in terms of\nhow one is socially positioned, where this is a function of, e.g., how\none is viewed, how one is treated, and how one’s life is\nstructured socially, legally, and economically.” On this\naccount, gender categories represent hierarchical relations in which\none group maintains a subordinate relation to another and the\ndifference between the two groups is marked by “sexual\ndifference” (2000, 38). Thus: \nHaslanger acknowledges that this definition excludes some we might\nintuitively think of as women such as women of inordinate privilege\nwho are not marked for subordination by their observed or imagined\nbodily features. Nevertheless, she thinks that if we tailor our\ndefinition to the feminist purposes of overcoming subordination these\n“women” are not the ones who matter (2000, 46).  \nYet Mari Mikkola (2009) claims that the confusion Haslanger’s terms\nwould create by excluding many commonly defined as women “is\nunlikely to help in the task of challenging existing social\nconditions.” For her part, Katharine Jenkins (2016) thinks the\ndefinition excludes some trans women. Indeed, she argues it probably\nincludes only those trans women whose gender presentation is respected\nbecause they are perceived as possessing bodily features associated\nwith a female’s role in reproduction and hence are perceived as either\ncisgender or as having undergone medical interventions that have\naltered some of their bodily features so that they now are understood\nas the same sort of features cis women possess (400). According to\nJenkins, Haslanger’s ameliorative project can be rescued by\nconsidering gender in terms not only of class, as Haslanger does in\ntalking about gender, but also as identity, as Haslanger does in\ntalking about race. Here gender and racial identities involve\nnavigating the norms associated with those identities. There are thus\ntwo concepts that need to be the focus of an ameliorative inquiry:\nbeing classed as a woman and having a female gender identity (415–6).\n \nThe concern with which Butler opens her 1990 and now-classic book,\nGender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, is\nthe relation between construction and representation. As a political\nmovement, feminism supposes that it represents a set of pre-existing\nsubjects, namely women, who are uniformly oppressed by a uniform\npatriarchy. Yet if we follow Foucault, we have to ask who these\npre-existing subjects are. More specifically, if we return to de\nBeauvoir’s claim that “One is not born, but rather becomes\na women” we have to ask who or what it is that becomes a woman.\nIt is misleading to think of oppression in terms of structures of\npower over against the subjects that precede them because subjects, as\nthe particular subjects they are, are first constituted through\nspecific authorizations “through the forms of power that\nregulate, control, represent and protect them.” Hence,\n“the juridical formation of language and politics that\nrepresents women as ‘the subject’ of feminism is itself a\ndiscursive formation and effect of a given version of representational\npolitics” (1990, 2). While de Beauvoir’s claim assumes a\npre-existing female sexed person who acquires the attitudes, behaviors\nand aspirations of a feminine gender through socialization, Butler\nmaintains that it is through regimes of gender that we first conceive\nof bodies as sexed. “Gender is … the discursive/cultural\nmeans by which ‘sexed nature’ or ‘a natural\nsex’ is produced and established as\n‘prediscursive’” (1990, 7). This discursive\nformation of both gender and sex is not only inevitably exclusionary\nand not only “the mark imposed by the oppressor” (Wittig\n1992, 11) but also inconsistent and incoherent both across different\nhistorical contexts (see Riley 1988) and in relation to race, class,\nsexual identities and so on.  \nAs Butler points out, Luce Irigaray (1985) complicates matters\nfurther. Here Irigaray’s reference is de Beauvoir’s claim that a woman\n“is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he\nwith reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as\nopposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute\n– she is the Other” (1953, 13). De Beauvoir insists that\nthere is no time in history in which women were not the Other: men are\nalways the One and women are always the Other. Moreover, as the Other,\nthey live only in relation to the One and have no free human existence\nor subjectivity on their own. They occupy space in a man’s world\nonly as relative and inessential aspects of it. Yet Irigaray explains\nthat if women are the Other to men they cannot be defined\nindependently of a definition of men. To define women as the Other of\nmen is to articulate their identity within a vocabulary that takes men\nas its norm. But if they cannot be defined independently of men, how\nare they be Other from them? If women can be articulated only within a\nmale-normed language, then language cannot get at their otherness at\nall. They are always, instead, part of a language system expressing\nthe One. The “exclusion” of women, Irigaray writes,\n“is internal to an order from which nothing escapes: the order\nof (man’s) discourse. To the objection that this discourse is\nperhaps not all there is, the response will be that it is women who\nare ‘not-all’” (1985, 88). Julia Kristeva agrees.\n“A woman cannot be,” she writes. “It is something\nwhich does not even belong in the order of being” (1981, 137).\nIf women disappear into various nodes of intersectionality in the\nanalytic tradition, in the continental they cannot be thought in the\nfirst place.  \nIs there any way to rescue them? Butler is not wedded to the idea that\nwe need a stable conception of women. Rather, she wonders whether we\nshould entertain “a radical critique that seeks to free feminist\ntheory from the necessity of having to construct a single or abiding\nground,” and she asks whether “the construction of the\ncategory of women as a coherent and stable subject” is “an\nunwitting regulation and reification of gender relations” (1990,\n5). Other feminists making use of continental sources are less sure\nabout this conclusion. Iris Marion Young (1994) turns to Jean-Paul\nSartre’s distinction between a series and a group. For Sartre, a\ngroup is a collection of people who consciously undertake a common\nproject together where the project typically is one best taken up by\nthis sort of group (1994, 724). Storming the Bastille is an example.\nIn contrast, a series is less organized and not at all self-conscious;\nhere the example is people waiting for a bus. These individuals\npossess a common interest in traveling along a certain route, but they\nhave, or need have, no direct relation to one another. This series\ncould become a group were individuals within it to start complaining\nabout the length of time they wait for the bus, and they could\nundertake together some sort of collective protest. Nonetheless,\nwithout this move toward collective action, they remain isolated from\none another and focused on the bus, which Sartre and Young call a\npractico-inert reality, rather than on each other.  \nWomen, for Young, are a series, where one practico-inert reality is an\neffect of a compulsory heterosexuality that focuses on the features of\na body connected to sexual reproduction. Other practico-inert\nrealities include pronouns, verbal and visual representations,\nclothes, cosmetics, social spaces, and spaces associated with the\nsexual division of work and other activities. In each case, these\nrealities describe structures or objects to which individuals relate\nthemselves serially, as they relate themselves to a bus. Conceiving of\nwomen as a series thus allows for the sense in which they share\ncertain features but in which they can also possess striking\ndifferences in their relation to the realities that make them part of\nthat series. Women are “a serial collective defined neither by\nany common identity nor by a common set of attributes that all\nindividual in the series share” (1994, 737).  \nIn another attempt to rescue women, Linda Martín Alcoff (2005)\nappeals to Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Hans-Georg Gadamer to anchor\nwomen’s identity in embodiment. Bodies and bodily experiences differ\nfor men and women. These differences can stem from cultural practices\nthat promote different ways of moving, siting, standing, running,\nspeaking, and throwing a ball, for instance. Moreover, because of\ndifferences in physical strength, men and women also approach the same\ntask differently, using different parts of their bodies to do the same\nthings. Finally, in distinction from men, women’s bodily experiences\ninclude the “experience of breasts, menses, lactation and\npregnancy” (Alcoff 2005, 106). For Alcoff, these differences\nlead to differences in women’s orientations or what, following\nGadamer, she calls horizons on themselves and their world. Alcoff does\nnot deny that these horizons vary according to the traditions and\ncultures to which various women belong; nor does she deny that\nhorizons also vary according to intersections with other factors, such\nas race and class. At the same time, she argues, “The\npossibility of pregnancy, childbirth, nursing, and in many societies,\nrape are parts of females’ horizons … and they exist there\nbecause of the ways we are embodied” (2005, 176). Yet, Stephanie\nJulia Kapusta (2016) questions Alcoff’s emphasis on biological\ndifferences and pregnancy given the way in which it can marginalize\nand inflict psychological, moral, or political harms on certain\nindividuals, including trans people. Georgia Warnke (2007) proposes a\ndifferent hermeneutic approach. Identities, she claims, are\ninterpretations of, or ways of understanding, who we and others are.\nAs such they necessarily comply with the conditions of understanding:\nthey are culturally and historically situated, motivated by particular\nconcerns and interests and inevitably partial. We can thus understand\npeople as women in particular contexts without requiring their\nidentities or commonalities to extend beyond them. Lauren Barthold\n(2016) takes up both Alcoff’s and Warnke’s accounts to conceive of\nwomen’s identity in Gadamerian terms as a dialogic one.  \nIn de Beauvoir’s work, both broadly analytic and broadly continental\nfeminist approaches find resources for raising questions about who\nwomen are, how they might be defined and for what purposes. Both\napproaches are interested in developing a definition of women that is\ninclusive, sensitive to intersecting oppressions and useful to\nfeminist struggles. There are affinities in some of the ways theorists\nin each tradition try to accomplish these goals: for example between\nGarry’s appeal to family resemblances and Young’s appeal to series\nthat can become groups. Critics within each tradition also overlap in\nquestioning the exclusions proffered definitions involve.  \nWith regard to questions of freedom and domination, the distinction\nbetween continental feminists in the (French) post-structuralist\ntradition and those in the (German) tradition of critical theory is\nperhaps more pronounced than that between the latter and those in the\nanalytic tradition.  \nButler (1990) begins her analysis by returning to Irigaray and\nKristeva’s criticism of de Beauvoir and arguing that their insights\ninto the closed nature of a gendered linguistic system raise issues\nabout a substance-accident metaphysics as a whole. According to this\nmetaphysics, both sex and gender are meant to be accidental attributes\nattached to a substantial subject. One is essentially a subject and\nonly accidentally a male or female, masculine or feminine one. Yet, if\nwomen can be defined only in terms of men, as the Other of men, then\nsex and gender are not as much accidents as they are relations –\nnot attributes a subject possesses but oppositions between linguistic\nterms: male versus female and masculine versus feminine. Furthermore,\nif sex and gender are not attributes, perhaps we should rethink the\nsubject or substance to which they are meant to attach. Perhaps there\nis only language which, in articulating a relation between male and\nfemale, masculine and feminine, posits a substance on which to erect\nthose terms. Butler quotes Michel Haar’s commentary on Nietzsche: \nIn other words, language inspires us to add substantial identities to\nactions because verbs need subjects. Turning from Nietzsche to J.L.\nAustin, Butler conceives of women (and men) as\n“performatives.” Performative speech acts for Austin are\nutterances such as “the meeting is now open” or “I\nnow pronounce you husband and wife” in which, uttered under\nappropriate circumstances, the speech act does something by saying\nsomething. The speech act thus brings a state of affairs into\nexistence. Likewise, according to Butler, the language of sex and\ngender, appropriately institutionalized, creates men and women. \nWhat is meant by appropriately institutionalized? For Foucault (1978)\nthe most important sites of power lie in everyday social practices\nsuch as social work, medicine and psychiatry, in scientific and social\nscientific disciplines that type individuals and create categories of\nidentity, and in institutions such as prisons, schools and hospitals.\nSuch power is productive: social institutions and practices create\nmodern identities such as gays, “blacks,” and\nmanic-depressives. For Butler and others, the construction of men and\nwomen takes a similar path, as the result of compulsory\nheterosexuality. As a form of power, compulsory heterosexuality\nimposes a set of norms about how and whom we should desire and\nestablishes a set of sanctions from this set. By doing so, it divides\nhuman populations into two genders that are in turn supposed to be\nconnected to two sexes with two directions of sexual desire. Thus, one\nis a man with a male body and a desire for women or one is a woman\nwith a female body and a desire for men. “The\nheterosexualization of desire,” Butler writes, “requires\nand institutes the production of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions\nbetween ‘feminine’ and ‘masculine,’ where\nthese are understood as expressive attributes of ‘male’\nand ‘female’” (1990, 17). \nThis account of identities as effects of power is obviously skeptical\nof our capacities for critical agency and rational reflection to which\nMarxists and other social critics have traditionally appealed for a\npurchase on relations of power and subordination. If the subject, as a\nwoman or gay person for example, is an effect of power, the structure\nof oppression is already built into the identity. How can women or gay\npeople be agents for the emancipation of, or equal justice for, women\nor gay people if their identity is itself an effect of unequal power\nrelations? Indeed, if we become subjects at all only within everyday\ndisciplinary practices, then subjects are always already effects of\npower. To emancipate ourselves from power would be to emancipate\nourselves from ourselves. How then are we to address issues of freedom\nand autonomy? Butler looks to resignification. Power not only produces\nbut reproduces itself and this constant production and reproduction\nserves as the opening for “resignification, redeployment,\nsubversive citation from within, and interruption and inadvertent\nconvergences with other [power/discourse] networks” (1995, 135).\nYet other continental feminists find this approach unsatisfying. Nancy\nFraser finds the positive connotations that Butler associates with\nresignification “puzzling.” “Why,” she asks,\n“is resignification good? Can’t there be bad (oppressive,\nreactionary) resignifications?”(1995, 67–8). If all subjectivity\nis a construction of power/discourse networks, why should we not\nsimply be content with the subjects that our current disciplinary\npractices enforce? Or, if some resignifications are good, which ones?\nHow do we determine which sort we should endorse? \nIn general, Fraser thinks feminists too eagerly turned to\npoststructuralist theories in the 1990s and that this turn has\nconsequences: not only does it leave women with no prospects for\nchange other than resignification but it also reduces gender\ninequality to a matter of language and culture and neglects\nsocio-economic issues such as female poverty (2013). Here her\ncriticism is directed at what she calls Lacanianism in feminism. The\nwork of Lacanian feminists has some merit, she says, in that it shows\ngender to be a discursive construction. Sexual identity is based on\nthe process of identification, language, and socialization in which\nthe child enters into the symbolic order, governed by the incest taboo\nor what Lacan calls “the law of the Father.” Subjugation\nto that law and becoming a subject are thus one and the same. Given\nthe law’s phallocentric tilt, women are pretty much\ncondemned. Nevertheless this analysis remains too historically\nunspecific for Fraser. What we need from discourse theory, she\nmaintains, are insights into how our social identities are formed and\naltered over time, how social groups form and disintegrate, how\ndominant groups retain their cultural dominance and what the prospects\nare for emancipatory change. \nSeyla Benhabib (1995), Amy Allen (2008) and Allison Weir (2013) also\nquestion equations between identity, law and power. Benhabib\ndistinguishes between a stronger and a weaker version of the claim\nthat identities such as women and gay people are constructions of\npower (1995, 20). The stronger version insists that subjects are\nentirely the effects of power, particularly of a compulsory\nheterosexuality, and that as effects they can only accept their mode\nof being a subject or try to subvert it from within. A weaker version\nof the claim, however, would simply emphasize that infants are born\ninto a world of existing gendered relations, hierarchies and\ndistributions of power and are acculturated into this world by\nparents, teachers and the like. To say that infants are born into\nprevailing structures of power, however, is not to say that they are\nalready entirely constituted by them. Hence, Benhabib claims, there\nremain capacities for reflection and accountability that are not simply\nthemselves effects of power. While more sympathetic to Foucault and\nButler, Allen uses Jessica Benjamin’s (1988) account of recognition to\nmake a similar point. There may be “no outside to power, in the\nsense that there is no possible human social world from which power\nhas been completely eliminated.” Nevertheless, we need not deny\n“moments of mutual recognition…within ongoing,\ndynamically unfolding, social relationships” that can provide\nfor both the constitution of autonomous selves and a reference point\nfor social and political critique (2008, 91). Weir likewise stresses\nrelations of recognition, as well as of “identification, of\nflourishing, of meaning, of love, of different kinds of power,\nincluding empowerment and solidarity” (2013, 91). Again,\nresistance to domination is not just a matter of resignifying within\noppressive structures. Rather it is a matter of transforming women.\nIndeed, she asks “What have we been doing in our women’s studies\nprograms, associations of feminist philosophers and academics,\nfeminist movements, lesbian communities, women’s cooperative, and\nculture building and other alternative communities if we haven’t been\n…producing women as something other than subjected?”\n(2013, 94).  \nWorking from an Anglo-American liberal tradition, Martha Nussbaum has\nraised questions similar to those that Allen, Benhabib, Fraser and\nWeir raise about a post-structuralist feminism. Indeed, she thinks the\nlatter is irretrievably self-involved and needs to be rejected in\nfavor of the kind of theoretical and practical work that can end\noppressive practices and institutions (1999a). Her own starting point\nis what she calls the “capabilities approach,” an approach\nthat is rooted in “respect for the dignity of persons as\nchoosers” (2000, 71–2) and that asks what individuals within a\ngiven society are able to do and to be – what their capabilities\nor freedoms are. Following Rawls here Nussbaum focuses on the\ndistribution of resources and opportunities within a country or\npolitical entity. Like Amartya Sen, she adds to Rawls’ view, first,\nthe question of what individuals’ needs for resources are and, second,\nthe question of how they are able to convert these resources into\nhuman functionings (1999, 34). By human functionings, Nussbaum means\nthe realization of one or more capability – the enjoyment of\ngood health, for example. She is interested in both the basic\nfunctionings, without which we would not regard a life as human or\nfully human, and the less basic functionings, without which we would\nnot regard a human life as flourishing. \nThe “we” here is not meant to be ethnocentric. The claim\nis, rather, that a just society provides individuals with capabilities\nfor human functionings where the idea of the important capabiliities\nis one to which people from different traditions with different\nconceptions of the good could agree as necessary to the pursuit of\ntheir conception. This idea provides a checklist of capabilities\nagainst which to measure forms of oppression and discrimination in\nparticular countries. Thus, inequalities based on gender hierarchies\nas well as practices such as female genital mutilation will be\nprecluded and a defense of such practices as part of the cultural\ntradition will not work. If cultural tradition confines women to the\nhouse, even if widowed and without means of support, then such\npractices are to be condemned as violating capabilities for even basic\nfunctioning. Indeed, while egregious practices such as female genital\nmutilation and female confinement violate capabilities for life,\nnutrition and bodily integrity, all inequalities based on gender\nhierarchies, in Nussbaum’s view, undermine capabilities for\nself-respect and emotional development that are part of human\nfunctioning. Ultimately, Nussbaum’s concerns are the same as Fraser’s:\nthat a focus on genealogy and resignification cannot do the work of\nundoing the social, political and economic discrimination that women\nsuffer in far too many cultures and countries and that it is this\ndiscrimination that feminism must try to combat.  \nOther feminists have concerns about Nussbaum’s approach, however.\nSusan Moller Okin objects to the narrative approach that Nussbaum\nintroduces in Women and Human Development insofar as it\nrelies on retelling the experiences of two poor Indian women, Vasanti\nand Jayamma. Okin points out that despite the sort of cross-cultural\ndialogue in which Nussbaum thinks feminists should engage (Nussbaum\n2000, 7), she rarely quotes these women directly and refracts their\nviews through her own (Okin 2003, 295). From where, then, does\nNussbaum’s checklist of capabilities come? Okin calls her idea\nof a fully human life “highly intellectualized” and\nmaintains that the capacities central to it “seem to derive far\nmore from an Aristotelian ideal than from any deep or broad\nfamiliarity with the lives of women in the less developed world”\n(203, 296). Likewise, while Alison Jagger thinks the narrative\napproach may be anodyne as long as it is meant simply heuristically,\nshe argues that there is little evidence that Nussbaum’s list of\ncapabilities reflects anything like a consensus or even overlapping\nconsensus of “people across the world who are reasonably\nwell-informed and uncoerced” (2006, 313). Rather, in spite of a\nlong list of interlocutors, Jagger thinks Nussbaum pays insufficient\nattention to questions of inclusiveness and representation.  \nFeminists in both the analytic and continental traditions raise\nconcerns about a post-structuralist identification of the subject,\nincluding the feminist subject, with power. If women, like gay people\nand others, are the effects of discourses of power how can they also\nbe the agents of their own emancipation? Some feminists find this\nquestion to be so removed from the horrific lives many women live as\nto be farcical. For example, Nussbaum asks that we attend to\ncapacities and functionings and Fraser likewise insists that we\nmove away from what she sees as purely cultural concerns to\nsocio-economic ones. Others try to secure theoretical grounds for\nagency and autonomy outside of power. \nFeminism has an obvious relation to epistemology insofar as it must\njustify the legitimacy of its claims and the credibility of those\nmaking them. Miranda Fricker’s book, Epistemic Injustice:\nPower and Ethics of Knowing (2007) has grounded much of the\ncurrent discussion in the analytic tradition, which has largely\nfocused on cataloguing and categorizing instances of epistemic\ninjustice. The continental tradition traces this issue back to\nconcerns with ideology and power/knowledge regimes that have long been\na part of emancipatory discussions. \nFricker takes up two varieties of epistemic injustice: testimonial and\nhermeneutical. Her account of the former can be seen as a development\nof claims Jennifer Hornsby and Rae Langton (1998) made about silencing\nwith reference to Catharine MacKinnon’s claim that pornography\ninterferes with women’s freedom of speech (1993). Freedom of\nspeech involves not simply the ability to make claims but, more\nimportantly, the ability to have illocutionary effects in which one’s\naudience takes up those claims. MacKinnon focuses on the ability to\nrefuse sex by saying no. Under the influence of pornography one’s\naudience may not recognize what one is trying to do with one’s words\nand may fail to take this no as a refusal. For Fricker, structural\nidentity prejudices in general affect one’s credibility as a\nspeaker and conveyor of knowledge. Her example is the way, in the\nscreenplay of “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” Marge Sherwood is\nunable to communicate her suspicions about Ripley to her\nfather-in-law, Herbert Greenleaf, because of the identity prejudices\nhe holds about women. Assuming that women tend to respond emotionally\ninstead of rationally to a situation, he downgrades her credibility\nand effectively silences her. The testimonial injustice here excludes\nSherwood from the social practice of pooling information.  \nKristie Dotson (2011) distinguishes two different kinds of silencing\npractices: testimonial quieting and testimonial smothering. While\ntestimonial quieting characterizes a failure to recognize the speaker\nas a knower and thus to offer the speaker appropriate uptake, Dotson\ndescribes testimonial smothering as a coerced truncation by speakers\nof their own testimony. Speakers recognize that their audiences are\nunwilling or unable to offer appropriate uptake to their testimony,\nand in response, limit and shape their testimony in order to\n“insure that the testimony contains only content for which\none’s audience demonstrates testimonial competence” (2011,\n244). Dotson characterizes both of these silencing practices as forms\nof epistemic violence, and both have dramatic effects for the\nepistemic pursuits of individuals and communities alike. \nWith regard to hermeneutical injustice, Fricker focuses on gaps in the\ncollective hermeneutical resources that make it difficult for members\nof particular groups, including women, to make sense out of and\narticulate important areas of their experience. The available\nresources are either not adequate for expressing these areas of\nexperience or they are misleading. Where this failure or inadequacy\naffects people differentially it is unjust, Fricker argues. As an\nexample she points to the damage done to many women’s lives and\ncareers after they suffered unwanted sexual advances on the job before\nsexual harassment was a hermeneutical resource available to make sense\nout of their experience (2007, 152). Fricker thinks it would be a\nmistake to see this gap in the collective hermeneutic resources as\nmerely bad timing, as might be the case if one suffered from a disease\nthat had not yet been diagnosed or understood. Rather, to the extent\nthat the gap affected women and their sexual harassers differentially\nit led to an injustice. It also derived from one. Fricker argues that\nthe hermeneutical gap was the result of “unequal hermeneutical\nparticipation” in which women were left out of or barred from\nengaging in the formation of the relevant collective understandings\n(Fricker 2007: 152). This marginalization, she argues, results from a\ncombination of two forms of power: identity power that downgrades a\nspeaker’s credibility and material power. In a social world in\nwhich men have more power than women, men also have more say over\ndefining what experiences mean and the result is to render “the\ncollective hermeneutical resource structurally prejudiced”\n(2007, 154–5). \nShelley Tremain (2017) finds a problem with Fricker’s distinction\nbetween hermeneutical gaps due to diseases not yet diagnosed and\nhermeneutical gaps that reflect hermeneutical injustice. While Fricker\nwants to see the former as a case of mere bad luck, Tremain points to\nthe lack of hermeneutical resources many disabled people suffer\nbecause of social, cultural and political norms that are as inadequate\nand misleading as those distorting attempts to articulate the\nexperience of sexual harassment. As she writes, “Until the\nrelatively recent formation and rise of ‘the mad pride\nmovement’ and related social movements, the hermeneutical\nresources that such disabled people required in order to collectively\nunderstand the political character of their situation were unavailable\nto them” (178).  \nOther feminists add to Fricker’s account of hermeneutical injustice\njust as they do to her account of testimonial injustice. Following up\non Charles Mills’ account of white ignorance (1998), Gaile Pohlhaus,\nJr. (2012), for example, conceives of the consequence of this\nstructural prejudice as a willful hermeneutical ignorance in which\n“dominantly situated knowers…continue to misunderstand\nand misinterpret the world” (2012, 716). Dotson uses this idea\nof willful hermeneutical ignorance to identify a third feature of\nepistemic injustice along with testimonial and hermeneutical\ninjustice: namely contributory injustice in which willful\nhermeneutical ignorance compromises a speaker’s epistemic agency\nand obstructs the capacity to contribute to a community’s\ncollective hermeneutical resources (2012, 31). Fricker now\ndistinguishes between “in-group intelligibility” within\nmarginalized groups and their “frustratingly failed attempts to\ncommunicate” (2016, 167) with dominant groups.  \nFricker’s solution to epistemic injustice looks to a sort of virtuous\nlistening that can undo prejudiced judgments of credibility. Feminists\nin the continental tradition appreciate her work but try to go beyond\ndyadic instances of epistemic injustice. Allen (2017) makes three\nrecommendations. First, we can look at what Jose Medina “complex\nhistories and chains of social interactions that go beyond particular\npairs and clusters of subjects” (Medina 2013, 60). Second, we\ncan look at Foucault’s account of power/knowledge regimes for a robust\naccount of collective hermeneutical resources and the exclusions they\nenforce as well of the institutional mechanisms that determine what is\nand is not to count as knowledge and who is and who is not to count as\na knower. Finally, we can look at Foucault’s development of genealogy\nas a form of critique that allows for the disruption of epistemic\nhierarchies that may be inherited but that are nonetheless contingent.\n \nOther feminists have sought an expanded version of deliberative theory\nthat can take what they see as better account of impediments to the\nparticipation of women and other marginalized groups. Thus, Young\nsubstitutes communicative for deliberative democracy in order to\nexpand the scope of considerations beyond the exchange of reasons to\ninclude story-telling as well as argumentation on grounds close to\nFricker’s and Dotson’s concerns: namely that power relations can\nstifle speech (1996, 123). Likewise Simone Chambers looks to a melding\nof deliberative and diversity theory (2003, 322) while Noelle McAfee\n(2008) looks beyond a Habermasian proceduralism to an integrative\nmodel of public deliberation that respects the importance of multiple,\npartial views.  \nThe concept of epistemic injustice has proved a fruitful one for\nfeminists, as for critical race theorists, disability theorists and\nothers.  Those in the analytic tradition have focused on mapping its\ncontours, nailing down the precise form of injustice it involves and\nexposing forms of socially positioned ignorance in which dominant\ngroups continue to misapprehend the world. Those in the continental\ntradition conceive of such ignorance as ideology and, like those in\nthe analytic tradition, understand it as a mechanism of both\ndistortion and silencing. They have also probed the conditions for\nforms of public communication and discourse free of coercion. Moving\non from Fricker’s work, feminists in both analytic and continental\ntraditions remain interested in expanding the concept of epistemic\ninjustice beyond dyadic relations to examine is systemic reach and\nconsequences.  \nAnalytic and continental feminists share interests in avoiding\nexclusion in attempts to define women, in overcoming patriarchal forms\nof oppression and in securing the claims of women to know and to\nparticipate in epistemic projects. Analytic and continental feminists\nsometimes pursue these interests in different ways, sometimes in\nsimilar ways and sometimes in conversation with one another.\nCollectively they take up and further develop a rich history of\nliberal, Marxist, post-structuralist, hermeneutic and linguistic\nthought.","contact.mail":"georgia.warnke@ucr.edu","contact.domain":"ucr.edu"}]
