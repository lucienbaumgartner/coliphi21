BCE,\nauthored a difficult metaphysical poem that has earned him a\nreputation as early Greek philosophy’s most profound and\nchallenging thinker. His philosophical stance has typically been\nunderstood as at once extremely paradoxical and yet crucial for the\nbroader development of Greek natural philosophy and metaphysics. He\nhas been seen as a metaphysical monist (of one stripe or another) who\nso challenged the naïve cosmological theories of his predecessors\nthat his major successors among the Presocratics were all driven to\ndevelop more sophisticated physical theories in response to his\narguments. The difficulties involved in the interpretation of his poem\nhave resulted in disagreement about many fundamental questions\nconcerning his philosophical views, such as: whether he actually was a\nmonist and, if so, what kind of monist he was; whether his system\nreflects a critical attitude toward earlier thinkers such as the\nMilesians, Pythagoreans, and Heraclitus, or whether he was motivated\nsimply by more strictly logical concerns, such as the paradox of\nnegative existentials that Bertrand Russell detected at the heart of\nhis thought; whether he considered the world of our everyday\nawareness, with its vast population of entities changing and affecting\none another in all manner of ways, to be simply an illusion, and thus\nwhether the lengthy cosmological portion of his poem represented a\ngenuine attempt to understand this world at all. This entry aims to\nprovide an overview of Parmenides’ work and of some of the major\ninterpretive approaches advanced over the past few decades. It\nconcludes by suggesting that understanding his thought and his place\nin the development of early Greek philosophy requires taking due\naccount of the fundamental modal distinctions that he was the first to\narticulate and explore with any precision.\n\nThe dramatic occasion of Plato’s dialogue, Parmenides,\nis a fictionalized visit to Athens by the eminent Parmenides and his\nyounger associate, Zeno, to attend the festival of the Great\nPanathenaea. Plato describes Parmenides as about sixty-five years old\nand Socrates, with whom he converses in the first part of the\ndialogue, as “quite young then,” which is normally taken\nto mean about twenty. Given that Socrates was a little past seventy\nwhen executed by the Athenians in 399 BCE, one can infer from this\ndescription that Parmenides was born about 515 BCE. He would thus\nappear to have been active during the early to mid-fifth century BCE.\nSpeusippus, Plato’s successor as head of the Academy, is said to\nhave reported in his On Philosophers that Parmenides\nestablished the laws for the citizens of his native Elea, one of the\nGreek colonies along southern Italy’s Tyrrhenian coast (Speus.\nfr. 3 Tarán ap. D.L. 9.23; cf. Plu. Col.\n1126A), though Elea was founded some 30 years before Parmenides’\nbirth. The ancient historiographic tradition naturally associates\nParmenides with thinkers such as Xenophanes and the Pythagoreans\nactive in Magna Graecia, the Greek-speaking regions of southern Italy,\nwhom he may well have encountered. A 1st c. CE portrait head of\nParmenides was discovered at Castellamare della Bruca (ancient Elea)\nin the 1960s with an inscription—“Parmeneides, son of\nPyres, Ouliadês, Natural Philosopher”—that\nassociates him with a cult of Apollo Oulios or Apollo the Healer. \nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, Parmenides composed only a single work\n(D.L. 1.16). This was a metaphysical and cosmological poem in the\ntraditional epic medium of hexameter verse. The title “On\nNature” under which it was transmitted is probably not\nauthentic. The poem originally extended to perhaps eight hundred\nverses, roughly one hundred and sixty of which have survived as\n“fragments” that vary in length from a single word (fr.\n15a: “water-rooted,” describing the earth) to the\nsixty-two verses of fragment 8. That any portion of his poem survives\nis due entirely to the fact that later ancient authors, beginning with\nPlato, for one reason or another felt the need to quote some portion\nof it in the course of their own writings. Sextus Empiricus quotes\nthirty of the thirty-two verses of fragment 1 (the opening Proem of\nthe poem), though apparently from some sort of Hellenistic digest\nrather than from an actual manuscript copy, for his quotation of fr.\n1.1–30 continues uninterruptedly with five and a half verses\nfrom fragments 7 and 8. The Alexandrian Neoplatonist Simplicius (6th\nc. CE) appears to have possessed a good copy of the work, from which\nhe quoted extensively in his commentaries on Aristotle’s\nPhysics and De Caelo. He introduces his lengthy\nquotation of fr. 8.1–52 as follows: “Even if one might\nthink it pedantic, I would gladly transcribe in this commentary the\nverses of Parmenides on the one being, which aren’t numerous,\nboth as evidence for what I have said and because of the scarcity of\nParmenides’ treatise.” Thanks to Simplicius’ lengthy\ntranscription, we appear to have the entirety of Parmenides’\nmajor metaphysical argument demonstrating the attributes of\n“What Is” (to eon) or “true reality”\n(alêtheia). \nWe are much less well informed about the cosmology Parmenides\nexpounded in the latter part of the poem and so must supplement the\nprimary evidence of the fragments with testimonia, that is,\nwith various reports or paraphrases of his theories that we also find\nin later authors. (A number of these testimonia are collected\namong the fifty-four “A-Fragmente” in the Parmenides\nsection of Diels and Kranz’s Die Fragmente der\nVorsokratiker. A more comprehensive collection of\ntestimonia, with English translations, is to be found in\nCoxon 2009, 99–267. Many of these testimonia are\npresented and translated together with the verbatim fragments in the\nD section of Laks and Most 2016.) As always when dealing with\nan ancient philosopher whose work has not survived entire, one must\ntake into account how the philosophical and other concerns of later\nauthors thanks to whom we know what we do of Parmenides’\noriginal poem are likely to have shaped the transmission of the extant\nfragments and testimonia. Certainly the partial and imperfect\npreservation of his poem is one factor that complicates understanding\nof his thought. \nParmenides’ poem began with a proem describing a journey he\nfiguratively once made to the abode of a goddess. He described how he\nwas conveyed on “the far-fabled path of the divinity” (fr.\n1.3) in a chariot by a team of mares and how the maiden daughters of\nHelios, the sun-god, led the way. These maidens take Parmenides to\nwhence they themselves have come, to “the halls of Night”\n(fr. 1.9), before which stand “the gates of the paths of night\nand day” (fr. 1.11). The maidens gently persuade Justice,\nguardian of these gates, to open them so that Parmenides himself may\npass through to the abode within. Parmenides thus describes how the\ngoddess who dwells there welcomed him upon his arrival: \nParmenides’ proem is no epistemological allegory of\nenlightenment but a topographically specific description of a mystical\njourney to the halls of Night. In Hesiod, the “horrible dwelling\nof dark Night” (Th. 744) is where the goddesses Night\nand Day alternately reside as the other traverses the sky above the\nEarth. Both Parmenides’ and Hesiod’s conception of this\nplace have their precedent in the Babylonian mythology of the sun\ngod’s abode. This abode also traditionally served as a place of\njudgment, and this fact tends to confirm that when Parmenides’\ngoddess tells him that no ill fate has sent him ahead to this place\n(fr. 1.26–27a), she is indicating that he has miraculously\nreached the place to which travel the souls of the dead. \nIn the proem, then, Parmenides casts himself in the role of an\ninitiate into the kind of mysteries that were during his day part of\nthe religious milieu of Magna Graecia. The motif of the initiate is\nimportant, for it informs Parmenides’ portrayal of himself as\none whose encounter with a major divinity has yielded a special\nknowledge or wisdom. The divinity in this instance would seem to be\nNight herself: Parmenides goes to “the halls of Night”\n(fr. 1.9), and the goddess who greets him welcomes him to “our\nhome” (fr. 1.25). The goddess Night serves as counselor to Zeus\nin some of the major Orphic cosmologies, including the Derveni\ncosmology (col. XI.10). In the closely related Orphic\nRhapsodies, Night instructs Zeus on how to preserve the unity\nproduced by his absorption of all things into himself as he sets about\ninitiating a new cosmogonic phase. It is thus appropriate that Night\nshould be the source of Parmenides’ revelation, for Parmenidean\nmetaphysics is very much concerned with the principle of unity in the\ncosmos. \nImmediately after welcoming Parmenides to her abode, the goddess\ndescribes as follows the content of the revelation he is about to\nreceive: \nThis programmatic announcement already indicates that the\ngoddess’ revelation will come in two major phases. The goddess\nprovides some further instruction and admonition before commencing the\nfirst phase, the demonstration of the nature of what she here\nmysteriously calls “the unshaken heart of well-rounded\nreality” (fr. 1.29). She then follows this first phase of her\nrevelation with what in the originally complete poem was a much longer\naccount of the principles, origins, and operation of the cosmos and\nits constituents, from the heavens and the sun, moon, and stars right\ndown to the earth and its population of living creatures, including\nhumans themselves. This second phase, a cosmological account in the\ntraditional Presocratic mold, is what she here refers to as “the\nnotions of mortals, in which there is no genuine\ntrustworthiness” (fr. 1.30). \nThe governing motif of the goddess’ revelation is that of the\n“ways of inquiry.” In the all-important fragment 2, she\nspecifies two such ways: \nThe second way of inquiry is here set aside virtually as soon as it is\nintroduced. The goddess goes on to refer back to the first way of\ninquiry and then speaks of another way as characteristic of mortal\ninquiry: \nHere the goddess again articulates the division of her revelation into\nthe two major phases first announced at the end of fragment 1. Compare\nher subsequent pronouncement at the point of transition from the first\nphase’s account of reality to the second phase’s\ncosmology: “At this point I cease for you the trustworthy\naccount and meditation/ regarding true reality; from this point on\nmortal notions/ learn, listening to the deceptive order of my\nverses” (fr. 8.50–2). \nClearly, the goddess’ account of “true reality”\nproceeds along the first way of inquiry introduced in fragment 2. Some\nhave thought the cosmology proceeds along the second way of inquiry\nintroduced at fr. 2.5, on the ground that the two ways introduced in\nfragment 2 appear to be presented as the only conceivable ways of\ninquiry. However, the way presented in fragment 6, as that along which\nwanders the thought of mortals “who have supposed that it is and\nis not the same and not the same” (fr. 6.7–8a), involves\nan intermingling of being and not-being altogether different from what\none sees in the way of inquiry earlier specified as “that [it]\nis not and that [it] must not be” (fr. 2.5). Fragment 6 thus\nappears to be introducing a third and different way, one not to be\nidentified with fragment 2’s second way, which has already been\nset aside. The same mixture of being and non-being likewise features\nin the goddess’ warning to Parmenides in fragment 7 not to allow\nhis thought to proceed along the way typical of mortal inquiries:\n“…for this may never be made manageable, that things that\nare not are./ But you from this way of inquiry restrain your\nunderstanding,/ and do not let habit born of much experience force you\nalong this way,/ to employ aimless sight and echoing hearing/ and\ntongue. But judge by reason the strife-filled critique/ I have\ndelivered” (fr. 7). Some have thought that here the\ngoddess’s last directive signals that some argument, with\nidentifiable premises and conclusion, has been presented in the\npreceding verses. She in fact appears to be indicating that her harsh\ncriticism of the inapprehension of ordinary humans, resulting from\ntheir exclusive reliance on the senses, has been designed to keep\nParmenides firmly planted on the first way of inquiry. \nThe goddess begins her account of “true reality,” or what\nis to be discovered along this first path, as follows: “As yet a\nsingle tale of a way/ remains, that it is; and along this path markers\nare there/ very many, that What Is is ungenerated and deathless,/\nwhole and uniform, and still and perfect” (fr. 8.1–4).\nWhat Is (to eon) has by this point become a name for what\nParmenides will form a fuller conception of by following the\ngoddess’ directions. These now include the programmatic\ndescription here in fr. 8.3–4 of the attributes What Is will be\nshown to have in the ensuing arguments. Thanks primarily to\nSimplicius’ transcription, we still possess in its entirety the\nportion of Parmenides’ poem comprising the goddess’s\nrevelation of the nature of “true reality.” This account\nconstitutes one of the philosophical tradition’s earliest, most\nextensive, and most important stretches of metaphysical reasoning. \nThe arguments here proceed methodically in accordance with the program\nannounced at fr. 8.3–4. The goddess begins by arguing, in fr.\n8.5–21, that What Is must be “ungenerated and\ndeathless”: \nFr. 8.5–6a, at the outset here, have often been taken as a\ndeclaration that What Is has some type of timeless existence. Given,\nhowever, that this verse and a half opens a chain of continuous\nargumentation, claiming that What Is does not come to be or pass away,\nthese words are probably better understood as a declaration of What\nIs’s uninterrupted existence. \nContinuing on, in fr. 8.22–5 the goddess presents a much briefer\nargument for What Is’s being “whole and\nuniform”: \nThen, at fr. 8.26–33, she argues that it is “still”\nor motionless: \nFinally, at fr. 8.42–9 (which Ebert 1989 has shown originally\nfollowed immediately after fr. 8.33, verses 34–41 having\nsuffered transposition from their original position following verse\n52), the goddess concludes by arguing that What Is must be\n“perfect,” before transitioning to the second phase of her\nrevelation: \nWe have decidedly less complete evidence for the revelation’s\nsecond phase, Parmenides’ cosmology. The direct evidence\nprovided by the last lines of fragment 8 (50–64) and by the\nother fragments plausibly assigned to this portion of the poem (frs. 9\nthrough 19) originally accounted for perhaps only ten percent of the\ncosmology’s original length. Since a number of these fragments\nare programmatic, we still have a good idea of some of the major\nsubjects it treated. From the end of fragments 8 and fragments 9\nthrough 15a we know that these included accounts of the cosmos’\ntwo basic principles, light and night, and then of the origin, nature,\nand behavior of the heavens and their inhabitants, including the\nstars, sun, moon, the Milky Way, and the earth itself. Witness the\nprogrammatic remarks of fragments 10 and 11: \nYou will know the aether’s nature, and in the aether all the/\nsigns, and the unseen works of the pure torch/ of the brilliant sun,\nand from whence they came to be,/ and you will learn the wandering\nworks of the round-eyed moon/ and its nature, and you will know too\nthe surrounding heaven,/ both whence it grew and how Necessity\ndirecting it bound it/ to furnish the limits of the stars. (Fr.\n10) \n…how the earth and sun and moon/ and the shared aether and the\nheavenly milk and Olympos/ outermost and the hot might of the stars\nbegan/ to come to be. (Fr. 11) \nA few fragments, including one known only via Latin translation, show\nthat Parmenides also dealt with the physiology of reproduction (frs.\n17–18) and with human thought (fr. 16). Fortunately, the sketchy\npicture of the cosmology furnished by the fragments is significantly\nimproved by the testimonia. The impression given by the\nfragments of the range of subjects is confirmed by both Simplicius,\nwho comments after quoting fr. 11 that Parmenides’ account of\nthe genesis of things extended down to the parts of animals (Simp.\nin Cael. 559.26–7), and likewise by Plutarch’s\njudgment that Parmenides’ cosmology has so much to say about the\nearth, heaven, sun, moon, and stars, right down to the genesis of\nhuman beings, that it omits none of the major subjects typically\ntreated by ancient natural philosophers (Plu. Col. 1114B-C).\nA particularly important testimonium in the doxographer\nAëtius paraphrases, explicates, and supplements fr. 12 in ways\nthat give us a better picture of the structure of Parmenides’\ncosmos (Aët. 2.7.1 = 28A37a Diels-Kranz). Likewise,\nTheophrastus’ comments on fragment 16 at De Sensibus\n1–4 appear to provide more information about Parmenides’\nviews on cognition. The ancient testimonia tend to confirm\nthat Parmenides sought to explain an incredibly wide range of natural\nphenomena, including especially the origins and specific behaviors of\nboth the heavenly bodies and the terrestrial population. One\nfundamental problem for developing a coherent view of\nParmenides’ philosophical achievement has been how to understand\nthe relation between the two major phases of the goddess’\nrevelation. \nWhile Parmenides is generally recognized as having played a major role\nin the development of ancient Greek natural philosophy and\nmetaphysics, fundamental disagreement persists about the upshot of his\nphilosophy and thus about the precise nature of his influence.\nSections 3.1 through 3.3 of what follows describe in brief outline the\ntypes of interpretation that have played the most prominent roles in\nthe development of broader narratives for the history of early Greek\nphilosophy. These sections do not purport to present a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of modern interpretations, nor do they make any attempt to\nreference all the representatives and variants of the principal types\nof interpretation here described. They are not meant to be a history\nof modern Parmenides interpretation, as worthy and fascinating a topic\nas that is. Since some advocates of the interpretations outlined in\nsections 3.1 to 3.3 have claimed to find ancient authority for their\nviews via selective appeal to certain facets of the ancient Parmenides\nreception, it will also be worthwhile indicating what was in fact the\nprevailing view of Parmenides in antiquity. After doing so in section\n3.4, the final section of this article will outline a type of\ninterpretation that takes the prevailing ancient view more seriously\nwhile responding to at least one major problem it encounters in the\nfragments. \nIf one wishes to adjudicate among the various types of interpretation,\none may start by recognizing some of the requirements upon a\nsuccessful interpretation, or an interpretation offering a\nhistorically plausible account of Parmenides’ thought in its\nplace and time. A successful interpretation must take account of\nadvances in the understanding of the text and transmission of the\nfragments of Parmenides’ poem, such as Theodor Ebert’s\nidentification of a transposition in fr. 8 (Ebert 1989) and the\nresults of Leonardo Tarán’s reexamination of the\nmanuscripts of Simplicius’s commentary on Aristotle’s\nPhysics (Tarán 1987). A successful interpretation\nshould attend to the fr. 1 proem’s indications of the\npoem’s cultural context. It should attend to the poem’s\nepistemology as well as to its logical and metaphysical dimensions.\nPerhaps most importantly, it should take full and proper account of\nParmenides’ cosmology (and not try to explain it away or else\nsimply ignore it). Attention in recent years to some of the most\ninnovative features of the cosmology have confirmed what should have\nbeen evident in any case, namely, that the cosmology that originally\ncomprised the greater part of his poem is Parmenides’ own\nexplanation of the world’s origins and operation (see especially\nMourelatos 2013, Graham 2013, and Mansfeld 2015). A successful\ninterpretation must explain the relation between the two major\nphases of the goddess’s revelation so that the existence of what\nis described in one is compatible with the existence of what is\ndescribed in the other. To this end, it should avoid attributing to\nParmenides views that are patently anachronistic or, worse, views that\ncannot be coherently asserted or maintained. A successful\ninterpretation also needs to attend carefully to the structure of\nParmenides’ argumentation in the path of conviction and to\nfollow it through to the end without lapsing into understanding his\nclaims that what is is \"ungenerated and deathless,/ whole and uniform,\nand still and perfect\" (fr. 8.3–4) as mere metaphors. \nA good many interpreters have taken the poem’s first major phase\nas an argument for strict monism, or the paradoxical view that there\nexists exactly one thing, and for this lone entity’s being\ntotally unchanging and undifferentiated. On this view, Parmenides\nconsiders the world of our ordinary experience non-existent and our\nnormal beliefs in the existence of change, plurality, and even, it\nseems, our own selves to be entirely deceptive. Although less common\nthan it once was, this type of view still has its adherents and is\nprobably familiar to many who have only a superficial acquaintance\nwith Parmenides. \nThe strict monist interpretation is influentially represented in the\nfirst two volumes of W. K. C. Guthrie’s A History of Greek\nPhilosophy, where it is accorded a critical role in the\ndevelopment of early Greek natural philosophy from the purported\nmaterial monism of the early Milesians to the pluralist physical\ntheories of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the early atomists, Leucippus\nand Democritus. On Guthrie’s strict monist reading,\nParmenides’ deduction of the nature of reality led him to\nconclude “that reality [is], and must be, a unity in the\nstrictest sense and that any change in it [is] impossible” and\ntherefore that “the world as perceived by the senses is\nunreal” (Guthrie 1965, 4–5). Finding reason and sensation\nto yield wildly contradictory views of reality, Parmenides presumed\nreason must be preferred and sensory evidence thereby rejected as\naltogether deceptive. His strict monism, on Guthrie’s view, took\nparticular aim at the monistic material principles of Milesian\ncosmology: \nA particular focus of Parmenides’ criticism, on this view, was\nAnaximander’s idea that the opposites are initially latent\nwithin the originative principle he called “the Boundless”\n(to apeiron) prior to being separated out from it: if these\nopposite characteristics existed prior to being separated out, then\nthe Boundless was not a true unity, but if they did not exist prior to\nbeing separated out, then how could they possibly come into existence?\nIt is thus illegitimate to suppose that everything came into being out\nof one thing (Guthrie 1962, 86–7). In addition to thus\ncriticizing the theoretical viability of the monistic material\nprinciples of the early Milesian cosmologists, Parmenides also is\nsupposed to have criticized the Milesian union of the material and\nmoving cause in their principles by arguing that motion and change are\nimpossible and inadmissible conceptions (Guthrie 1965, 5–6,\n52). \nAs we have seen, Parmenides’ insistence on the point that\nwhatever is, is, and cannot ever not be leads him to be harshly\ncritical of the ordinary run of mortals who rely on their senses in\nsupposing that things are generated and undergo all manner of changes.\nParmenides directs us to judge reality by reason and not to trust the\nsenses. Reason, as deployed in the intricate, multi-staged deduction\nof fragment 8, reveals what attributes whatever is must possess:\nwhatever is must be ungenerated and imperishable; one, continuous and\nindivisible; and motionless and altogether unchanging, such that past\nand future are meaningless for it. This is “all that can be said\nabout what truly exists,” and reality is thus revealed as\n“something utterly different from the world in which each one of\nus supposes himself to live,” a world which is nothing but a\n“deceitful show” (Guthrie 1965, 51). Parmenides\nnonetheless proceeded in the second part of his poem to present an\nelaborate cosmology along traditional lines, thus presenting readers\nwith the following crux: “Why should Parmenides take the trouble\nto narrate a detailed cosmogony when he has already proved that\nopposites cannot exist and there can be no cosmogony because plurality\nand change are inadmissible conceptions?” (Guthrie 1965, 5).\nGuthrie suggests that Parmenides is “doing his best for the\nsensible world…by giving as coherent an account of it as he\ncan,” on the practical ground that our senses continue to\ndeceive us about its existence: “His account of appearances will\nexcel those of others. To ask ‘But if it is unreal, what is the\npoint of trying to give an account of it at all?’ is to put a\nquestion that is not likely to have occurred to him” (Guthrie\n1965, 5 and 52). \nOne problem with Guthrie’s view of Parmenides is that the\nsupposition that Parmenides’ strict monism was developed as a\ncritical reductio of Milesian material monism sits\nuncomfortably with the notion that he actually embraced this wildly\ncounter-intuitive metaphysical position. There is the same type of\ntension in the outmoded proposals that Parmenides was targeting\ncertain supposedly Pythagorean doctrines (a view developed in Raven\n1948 and ensconced in Kirk and Raven 1957). Even as Guthrie was\nwriting the first two volumes of his History, a shift was\nunderway toward understanding Parmenides’ arguments as driven by\nstrictly logical considerations rather than by any critical agenda\nwith respect to the theories of his Ionian or Pythagorean\npredecessors. Here the watershed event was the publication of G. E. L.\nOwen’s “Eleatic Questions” (Owen 1960). Owen found\ninspiration in Bertrand Russell for his positive interpretation of\nParmenides’ argument in fragment 2, the essential point of which\nOwen took to be that what can be talked or thought about exists. \nRussell’s treatment of Parmenides in his A History of\nWestern Philosophy was conditioned by his own abiding concern\nwith the problems of analysis posed by negative existential\nstatements. The essence of Parmenides’ argument, according to\nRussell, is as follows: \nHere the unargued identification of the subject of Parmenides’\ndiscourse as “whatever can be thought of or spoken of”\nprefigures Owen’s identification of it as “whatever can be\nthought and talked about,” with both proposals deriving from fr.\n2.7–8. There follows in Russell’s History an\nexposition of the problems involved in speaking meaningfully about\n(currently) non-existent subjects, such as George Washington or\nHamlet, after which Russell restates the first stage of\nParmenides’ argument as follows: “if a word can be used\nsignificantly it must mean something, not nothing, and\ntherefore what the word means must in some sense exist” (Russell\n1945, 50). So influential has Russell’s understanding been,\nthanks in no small part to Owen’s careful development of it,\nthat it is not uncommon for the problem of negative existential\nstatements to be referred to as “Parmenides’\nparadox.” \nThe arguments of fragment 8, on this view, are then understood as\nshowing that what can be thought and talked about is, surprisingly,\nwithout variation in time and space, that is, absolutely one and\nunchanging. Owen adapted an image from Wittgenstein in characterizing\nthese arguments, ones which “can only show the vacuousness of\ntemporal and spatial distinctions by a proof which employs\nthem,” as “a ladder which must be thrown away when one has\nclimbed it” (Owen 1960, 67). Owen also vigorously opposed the\nassumption that “Parmenides wrote his poem in the broad\ntradition of Ionian and Italian cosmology,” arguing that\nParmenides claims no measure of truth or reliability for the cosmogony\nin the latter part of his poem and that his own arguments in the\n“Truth” (i.e., the “Way of Conviction”)\nneither derive from this earlier tradition nor depict the cosmos as\nspherical in shape (Owen 1960, 48). On Owen’s reading, not so\nvery differently from Guthrie’s, Parmenides’ cosmology is\n“no more than a dialectical device,” that is, “the\ncorrect or the most plausible analysis of those presuppositions on\nwhich ordinary men, and not just theorists, seem to build their\npicture of the physical world,” these being “the existence\nof at least two irreducibly different things in a constant process of\ninteraction,” whereas Parmenides’ own arguments have by\nthis point shown both the plurality and change this picture\npresupposes to be unacceptable (Owen 1960, 50 and 54–5). \nOwen’s view of Parmenidean metaphysics as driven by primarily\nlogical concerns and of his cosmology as no more than a dialectical\ndevice would have a deep influence on two of the most important\nsurveys of Presocratic thought since Guthrie—Jonathan\nBarnes’s The Presocratic Philosophers\n(19791, 19822) and Kirk, Raven, and\nSchofield’s The Presocratic Philosophers\n(19832). While abandoning the idea that Parmenidean monism\nwas a specific reaction to the theories of any of his predecessors,\nthese two works continue to depict his impact on later Presocratic\nsystems as decisive. On their Owenian line, the story becomes that the\narguments of Parmenides and his Eleatic successors were meant to be\ngenerally destructive of all previous cosmological theorizing, in so\nfar as they purported to show that the existence of change, time, and\nplurality cannot be naively presumed. Parmenides’ arguments in\nfragment 8 effectively become, for advocates of this line, a\ngeneralized rather than a specific reductio of early Greek\ncosmological theorizing. Barnes, furthermore, responded to an\nobjection that had been raised against Owen’s identification of\nParmenides’ subject as whatever can be talked and thought\nabout—namely, that this identification derives from the reason\ngiven at fr. 2.7–8 for rejecting the second path of inquiry,\nwhereas an audience could not be expected to understand this to be the\ngoddess’ subject when she introduces the first two ways of\ninquiry in fr. 2.3 and 2.5. Barnes modified Owen’s\nidentification of Parmenides’ subject so that it might be found\nin the immediate context, specifically in the implicit object of fr.\n2.2’s description of the paths as “ways of inquiry”;\nthus, according to Barnes, the first path “says that\nwhatever we inquire into exists, and cannot not exist”\n(Barnes 1982, 163). Barnes’s modified Owenian line has since\nbeen endorsed by prominent interpreters (including Schofield in Kirk,\nRaven, and Schofield 1983, 245; cf. Brown 1994, 217). Barnes also\nadvanced the more heterodox proposal that Parmenides was not\nnecessarily a monist at all, arguing that the fragments are compatible\nwith the existence of a plurality of “Parmenidean Beings”\n(Barnes 1979, cf. Untersteiner 1955). While this proposal has had\nfewer adherents among other interpreters favoring the Russell-Owen\nline, it has been taken up by certain advocates of the next type of\ninterpretation. \nOne influential alternative to interpretations of Parmenides as a\nstrict monist, certainly among scholars working in America, has been\nthat developed by Alexander Mourelatos in his 1970 monograph, The\nRoute of Parmenides. (See Mourelatos 1979 for a succinct\npresentation of this alternative in response to perceived shortcomings\nin Owen’s logical-dialectical reading.) Mourelatos saw\nParmenides as utilizing a specialized, predicative sense of the verb\n“to be” in speaking of “what is”, a sense used\nto reveal a thing’s nature or essence. This sense of the verb,\ndubbed by Mourelatos “the ‘is’ of speculative\npredication,” is supposed to feature in statements of the form,\n“X is Y,” where the predicate\n“belongs essentially to, or is a necessary condition for, the\nsubject” and thus gives X’s reality, essence,\nnature, or true constitution (Mourelatos 1970, 56–60). Alexander\nNehamas would likewise propose that Parmenides employs\n“is” in the very strong sense of “is what it is to\nbe,” so that his concern is with “things which are\nF in the strong sense of being what it is to be\nF” (Nehamas 1981, 107; although Nehamas cites Owen as\nwell as Mourelatos as an influence, Owen himself took\nParmenides’ use of the verb “to be” in “what\nis” as existential [see Owen 1960, 94]). On the resulting type\nof interpretation, the first major phase of Parmenides’ poem\nprovides a higher-order account of what the fundamental entities of\nany ontology would have to be like: they would have to be F,\nfor some F, in this specially strong way. As such, it is not\nan account of what there is (namely, one thing, the only one that\nexists) but, rather, of whatever is in the manner required to be an\nontologically fundamental entity—a thing that is F, for\nsome F, in an essential way. Thus Nehamas has more recently\nwritten: \nA variant of the meta-principle interpretation, one that also draws\nupon Barnes’s suggestion that nothing in the “Truth”\nprecludes there being a plurality of Parmenidean Beings, has been\ndeveloped by Patricia Curd. On her view, Parmenides was not a strict\nmonist but, rather, a proponent of what she terms “predicational\nmonism,” which she defines as “the claim that each thing\nthat is can be only one thing; it can hold only the one predicate that\nindicates what it is, and must hold it in a particularly strong way.\nTo be a genuine entity, a thing must be a predicational unity, with a\nsingle account of what it is; but it need not be the case that there\nexists only one such thing. Rather, the thing itself must be a unified\nwhole. If it is, say, F, it must be all, only, and completely\nF. On predicational monism, a numerical plurality of such\none-beings (as we might call them) is possible” (Curd 1998,\n66). \nMourelatos, Nehamas, and Curd all take Parmenides to be concerned with\nspecifying in an abstract way what it is to be the nature or essence\nof a thing, rather than simply with specifying what there in fact is,\nas he is presumed to be doing on both the logical-dialectical and the\nmore traditional strict monist readings. Since the meta-principle\nreading takes Parmenides’ major argument in fragment 8 to be\nprogrammatic instead of merely paradoxical or destructive, it suggests\na somewhat different narrative structure for the history of early\nGreek philosophy, one where the so-called “post-Parmenidean\npluralists”—Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the early\natomists, Leucippus and Democritus—were not reacting against\nParmenides, but were actually endorsing his requirements that what\nreally is be ungenerated, imperishable, and absolutely changeless,\nwhen they conceived of the principles of their respective physical\nsystems in these terms. The meta-principle reading has also seemed to\nre-open the possibility that Parmenides was engaged in critical\nreflection upon the principles of his predecessors’ physical\nsystems. \nIf the first phase of Parmenides’ poem provides a higher-order\ndescription of the features that must belong to any proper physical\nprinciple, then one would naturally expect the ensuing cosmology to\ndeploy principles that meet Parmenides’ own requirements. The\ngoddess describes the cosmology, however, as an account of “the\nbeliefs of mortals, in which there is no genuine conviction”\n(fr. 1.30, cf. fr. 8.50–2) and commences this part of her\nrevelation by describing how mortals have wandered astray by picking\nout two forms, light and night, to serve as the basis for an account\nof the cosmos’ origin and operation (fr. 8.53–9).\nAdvocates of the meta-principle reading here face a dilemma. On the\none hand, they cannot plausibly maintain that the cosmology is what\ntheir overall interpretation would lead one to expect, namely,\nParmenides’ effort at developing a cosmology in accordance with\nhis own strictures upon what the principles of such an account must be\nlike. The cosmological principles light and night do not in fact\nconform to those strictures. But then why should Parmenides have\nbothered to present a fundamentally flawed or\n“near-correct” cosmology, founded upon principles that\nfail to satisfy the very requirements he himself has supposedly\nspecified? If one falls back on the position that the cosmology in the\npoem is not Parmenides’ own (which remains implausible given the\ncosmology’s innovations), then it becomes even more puzzling why\nhe should have described what the principles of an adequate cosmology\nmust be like and then failed to try to present one. \nThe presence of the cosmology in Parmenides’ poem continues to\nbe problematic for advocates of the meta-principle interpretation,\njust as it is for advocates of the other major types of interpretation\ndiscussed thus far. Guthrie views the cosmology as Parmenides’\nbest attempt at giving an account of the sensible world, given that we\nwill continue to be deceived into thinking it exists despite his\narguments to the contrary. Not only is this an unstable interpretive\nposition, it imputes confusion to Parmenides rather than acknowledge\nits own difficulties. It is hardly more satisfying to be told by Owen\nthat Parmenides’ cosmology has a purpose that is “wholly\ndialectical” (Owen 1960, 54–5; cf. Long 1963 for a more\ndetailed development of this interpretive line). \nAlthough they repeat the essentials of Owen’s view, Kirk, Raven,\nand Schofield finally acknowledge that the presence of the elaborate\ncosmology remains problematic for this line of interpretation:\n“Why [the cosmology] was included in the poem remains a mystery:\nthe goddess seeks to save the phenomena so far as is possible, but she\nknows and tells us that the project is impossible” (Kirk, Raven,\nand Schofield 1983, 262, after echoing Owen’s line on the\ncosmology’s dialectical character at 254–6). While the\nmeta–principle interpretation raises the expectation, which\nfails to be met, that the principles of Parmenides’ cosmology\nwill conform to the requirements he has supposedly specified earlier\nin the poem, the strict monist and logical-dialectical interpretations\nleave even some of their own advocates wondering why Parmenides\ndevoted the bulk of his poem to an account of things his own reasoning\nis supposed to have shown do not exist. \nThe idea that Parmenides’ arguments so problematized the\nphenomenon of change as to make developing an adequate theoretical\naccount of it the central preoccupation of subsequent Presocratic\nnatural philosophers is a commonplace of modern historical narratives.\nUnfortunately, this notion has no real ancient authority.\nAristotle’s account at Physics\n1.8.191a23–33 of the wrong turn he claims earlier\nnatural philosophers took in trying to understand the principles of\nchange has often been thought to legitimate this view, given the\nEleatic-sounding argument it records. But Aristotle mentions\nParmenides nowhere in the passage, and his complaint is in fact\nbroadly directed against all the early Greek philosophers whose views\nhe has been surveying previously in the book. He complains that they\nnaively adopted the view that no fundamental entity or substance comes\nto be or perishes, the result being that they are unable to account\nfor, because they disavow, substantial change, which is the very\nphenomenon Aristotle is most interested in explaining. Aristotle\nactually understands Parmenides’ thesis that what is is one\n(hen to on) and not subject to generation and change as\nbelonging, not to natural philosophy, but to first philosophy or\nmetaphysics (Cael. 3.1.298b14–24; cf.\nMetaph. 1.5.986b14–18, Ph.\n1.2.184a25-b12). \nIn the complex treatment of Parmenides in Physics\n1.2–3, Aristotle introduces Parmenides together with Melissus as\nrepresenting the position – within the doxographical schema\nadapted from that in Gorgias's On Nature, or On What is\nNot that structures his own examination of earlier\narchê-theories – that there is a single and\nunchanging archê or principle (Ph.\n1.2.184b15–16). Aristotle recognizes, however, that\nthis grouping obscures very real differences between the two\nthinkers’ views. According to Aristotle, Melissus held that\neverything is a single, i.e. continuous or indivisible, and unlimited\nquantity (or extension). Parmenides, on Aristotle’s\nreconstruction, recognized only a use of “being”\nindicating what something is in respect of its substance or essence;\nhe accordingly supposed that everything that is is substance, and he\nsupposed everything to be one in the sense that the account of the\nessence of everything is identical. Furthermore, on Aristotle’s\nview of Parmenides, whatever might differentiate what is cannot do so\nwith respect to its essence but only accidentally. But no accident of\nwhat just is can belong to its essence, and since Parmenides admits\nonly a use of “being” indicating what something is in\nrespect of its substance or essence, no differentiating accident of\nwhat is can be said to be. Such is the thrust of Aristotle’s\nreconstruction of Parmenides’ reasoning at Physics\n1.3.186a34-b4 and, likewise, of his summary\nallusion to this passage at Metaphysics\n1.5.986b28–31. \nThe only point where Aristotle’s representation of Parmenides in\nMetaphysics 1.5 appears to differ from the major treatment in\nPhysics 1.2–3 is in following up this summary with the\nqualification that, being compelled to go with the phenomena, and\nsupposing that what is is one with respect to the account (sc. of its\nessence) but plural with respect to perception, he posited a duality\nof principles as the basis for his account of the phenomena\n(986b27–34, reading to on hen men at\n986b31, as per Alexander of\nAphrodisias’s paraphrase). This is only a superficial\ndifference, given how at Physics\n1.5.188a19–22 Aristotle points to the Parmenidean\nduality of principles to support his thesis that all his predecessors\nhad made the opposites principles, including those who maintained that\neverything is one and unchanging. Nonetheless, the representation of\nParmenides’ position in Metaphysics 1.5, according to\nwhich what is is one with respect to the account of its essence but\nplural with respect to perception, is more indulgent than the\nreconstruction of Parmenides’ reasoning in Physics 1.3\nin that it allows for a differentiated aspect of what is. By allowing\nthat what is may be differentiated with respect to its phenomenal\nqualities, Aristotle seems to have recognized at some level the\nmistake in assuming that Parmenides’ failure to distinguish\nexplicitly among the senses of “being” entails that he\ncould only have employed the term in one sense. \nDespite the assimilation of Melissus and Parmenides under the rubric\ninherited from Gorgias, Aristotle recognized that grouping the two\nfigures together under this convenient label obscured fundamental\ndifferences in their positions. The fact is that “monism”\ndoes not denote a unique metaphysical position but a family of\npositions. Among its species are strict monism or the position that\njust one thing exists. This is the position Melissus advocated, one\nwhich no serious metaphysician should want to adopt. More familiar\nspecies include both numerical and generic substance monism, according\nto which, respectively, there is a single substance or a single kind\nof substance. Aristotle seems ultimately to have inclined toward\nattributing this first type of “generous” monism to\nParmenides. In viewing Parmenides as a generous monist, whose position\nallowed for the existence of other entities, rather than as a\n“strict” monist holding that only one thing exists,\nAristotle is in accord with the majority view of Parmenides in\nantiquity. \nThat some in antiquity viewed Parmenides as a strict monist is evident\nfrom Plutarch’s report of the Epicurean Colotes’ treatment\nof Parmenides in his treatise, That One Cannot Live According to\nthe Doctrines of Other Philosophers. Colotes’ main claim\nappears to have been that Parmenides prevents us from living by\nmaintaining that “the universe is one” (hen to\npan), a tag which Colotes apparently took to mean that Parmenides\ndenied the existence of fire and water and, indeed, “the\ninhabited cities in Europe and Asia”; he may also have claimed\nthat if one accepts Parmenides’ thesis, there will be nothing to\nprevent one from walking off a precipice, since on his view there are\nno such things (Plut. Col. 1114B). In short, as Plutarch\nreports, Colotes said that “Parmenides abolishes everything by\nhypothesizing that being is one” (1114D). Plutarch himself,\nhowever, takes strong issue with Colotes’ view, charging him\nwith imputing to Parmenides “disgraceful sophisms” (1113F)\nand with deliberately misconstruing his position (1114D). Plutarch\nexplains that Parmenides was in fact the first to distinguish between\nthe mutable objects of sensation and the unchanging character of the\nintelligible: “Parmenides…abolishes neither nature.\nInstead, assigning to each what is appropriate, he places the\nintelligible in the class of what is one and being—calling it\n‘being’ in so far as it is eternal and imperishable, and\n‘one’ because of its likeness unto itself and its not\nadmitting differentiation—while he locates the perceptible among\nwhat is disordered and changing” (1114D). Plutarch insists that\nParmenides’ distinction between what really is and things which\nare what they are at one time, or in one context, but not another\nshould not be misconstrued as an abolition of the latter class of\nentities: “how could he have let perception and doxa\nremain without leaving what is apprehended by perception and\ndoxa?” (1114E-F). Plutarch’s discussion of\nParmenides in Against Colotes is particularly significant in\nthat it is a substantial discussion of the relation between his\naccount of Being and his cosmology by an ancient author later than\nAristotle that is not overtly influenced by Aristotle’s own\ndiscussions. In many ways it anticipates the Neoplatonic\ninterpretation, represented in Simplicius, according to which, broadly\nspeaking, the two accounts delivered by Parmenides’ goddess\ndescribe two levels of reality, the immutable intelligible realm and\nthe plural and changing sensible realm (see especially\nSimplicius’s commentary on Arist. Cael.\n3.1.298b14–24; cf. Procl. in Ti.\n1.345.18–24). \nLater Platonists naturally understood Parmenides as thus anticipating\nPlato, for Plato himself seems to have adopted a\n“Platonist” understanding of this thinker whose influence\non his own philosophy was every bit as profound as that of Socrates\nand the Pythagoreans. Aristotle attributes to both Parmenides and\nPlato the recognition that knowledge requires as its objects certain\nnatures or entities not susceptible to change—to Parmenides in\nDe Caelo 3.1, and to Plato, in remarkably similar language,\nin Metaphysics 13.4. The arguments at the end of\nRepublic 5 that confirm Aristotle’s attribution of this\nline of reasoning to Plato are in fact suffused with echoes of\nParmenides. Plato likewise has his fictionalized Parmenides present\nsomething very close to this line of argument in the dialogue bearing\nhis name: “if someone will not admit that there are general\nkinds of entities…and will not specify some form for each\nindividual thing, he will have nowhere to turn his intellect, since he\ndoes not admit that there is a character for each of the things that\nare that is always the same, and in this manner he will destroy the\npossibility of discourse altogether” (Prm. 135b5-c2).\nThe Platonic “natures” Aristotle has in mind are clearly\nthe Forms that Plato himself is prone to describing in language that\nechoes the attributes of Parmenidean Being, most notably at\nSymposium 210e-211b and Phaedo 78d and 80b. That\nPlato’s Forms are made to look like a plurality of Parmenidean\nBeings might seem to supply Platonic authority for the meta-principle\ninterpretation. This would be a rash conclusion, however, for Plato\nconsistently represents Parmenides as a monist in later dialogues\n(see, e.g., Prm. 128a8-b1, d1, Tht. 180e2–4,\n183e3–4, Sph. 242d6, 244b6). Determining just what type\nof monism Plato means to attribute to Parmenides in these dialogues\nultimately requires plunging into the intricacies of the examination\nof Parmenides’ thesis in the latter part of the\nParmenides. \nPlato’s understanding of Parmenides is best reflected in that\ndialogue’s exploration of his thesis in the Second Deduction\n(Prm. 142a9 ff.). There the One is shown to have a number of\nproperties that reflect those Parmenides himself attributed to Being\nin the course of fr. 8: that it is in itself and the same as itself,\nthat it is at rest, that it is like itself, that it is in contact with\nitself, etc. In the Second Deduction, all these properties prove to\nbelong to the One in virtue of its own nature and in relation to\nitself. This deduction also shows that the One has apparently contrary\nattributes, though these prove to belong to it in other aspects, that\nis, not in virtue of its own nature and/or not in relation to itself.\nPlato would have found a model for his complex account of the various\nand seemingly conflicting properties of the One in the two\nmajor phases of Parmenides’ poem if he, too, subscribed to\nan “aspectual” interpretation of Parmenides, according to\nwhich the Way of Conviction describes the cosmos in its intelligible\naspect qua being, while allowing that this description is\ncompatible with an alternate description of this self-same entity as a\nworld system comprised of differentiated and changing objects. These\ntwo perspectives are notably reflected, respectively, in the\nTimaeus’s descriptions of the intelligible living\ncreature and of the visible cosmos modelled upon it, both of which are\nsuffused with echoes of Parmenides (see especially Ti. 30d2,\n31a7-b3, 32c5-33a2, 33b4-6, d2-3, 34a3–4, b1–2, and\n92c6–9). \nThat Aristotle also viewed the two major phases of Parmenides’\npoem as dual accounts of the same entity in different aspects is\nperhaps most apparent in his characterization of Parmenides, in the\ncourse of the discussion at Metaphysics\n1.5.986b27–34, as having supposed that “what is\nis one in account but plural with respect to perception.”\nTheophrastus likewise seems to have adopted such a line. Alexander of\nAphrodisias quotes him as having written the following of Parmenides\nin the first book of his On the Natural Philosophers: \nMany of Theophrastus’s points here can be traced back to\nAristotle, including the identification of Parmenides’ elemental\nlight and night as, respectively, fire functioning as an efficient\nprinciple and earth functioning as a material principle (cf. Arist.\nPh. 1.5.188a20–2, GC\n1.3.318b6–7, 2.3.330b13–14,\nMetaph. 1.5.986b28–987a2). The\npassage on the whole suggests that, like Plato and Aristotle,\nTheophrastus understood Parmenides as furnishing dual accounts of the\nuniverse, first in its intelligible and then in its phenomenal\naspects. \nWhile it would be going too far to claim that Plato, Aristotle,\nTheophrastus, and the ancient thinkers who follow their broad view of\nParmenides as a generous monist got Parmenides right on all points,\nnonetheless the impulse toward “correcting” (or just\nignoring) the ancient evidence for Presocratic thought has in this\ncase gone too far. Both Plato and Aristotle understood Parmenides as\nperhaps the first to have developed the idea that apprehension of what\nis unchanging is of a different order epistemologically than\napprehension of things subject to change. More fundamentally, Plato\nand Aristotle both came to understand Parmenides as a type of generous\nmonist whose conception of what is belongs more to theology or first\nphilosophy than to natural science. This involved understanding\nParmenides’ cosmology as his own account of the world in so far\nas it is subject to change. It also involved understanding the first\npart of Parmenides’ poem as metaphysical, in the proper\nAristotelian sense of being concerned with what is not subject to\nchange and enjoys a non-dependent existence. Most importantly, both\nPlato and Aristotle recognized that a distinction between the\nfundamental modalities or ways of being was central to\nParmenides’ system. None of these major points is tainted by the\nkind of obvious anachronism that rightly makes one suspicious, for\ninstance, about Aristotle’s identification of Parmenides’\nlight and night with the elements fire and earth. None of these broad\npoints, in other words, involves Plato or Aristotle viewing Parmenides\nthrough the distorting lens of their own concepetual apparatus. The\nnext section will outline the view of Parmenides’ philosophical\nachievement that results from attending to his modal distinctions and\nto the epistemological distinctions he builds upon them. \nNumerous interpreters have variously resisted the idea that Parmenides\nmeant to deny the very existence of the world we experience. They have\nconsequently advocated some more robust status for the cosmological\nportion of his poem. (See, e.g., Minar 1949, Woodbury 1958, Chalmers\n1960, Clark 1969, Owens 1974, Robinson 1979, de Rijk 1983, and\nFinkelberg 1986, 1988, and 1999, and Hussey 1990.) Unfortunately, too\nmany interpretations of this type deploy the terms\n“reality,” “phenomena,” and\n“appearance” so ambiguously that it can be difficult to\ntell whether they intend to attribute an objective or merely some\nsubjective existence to the inhabitants of the\n“phenomenal” world. More positively, a number of these\ninterpreters have recognized the important point that the two parts of\nthe goddess’ revelation are presented as having different\nepistemic status. (See also the proposal at Kahn 1969, 710 and n. 13,\nto identify Parmenides’ subject in the Way of Conviction as\n“the object of knowing, what is or can be known.”) They\nhave nonetheless failed to take proper account of the modal\ndistinctions that define Parmenides’ presentation of the ways of\ninquiry. In this omission they are not alone, of course, since none of\nthe types of interpretation reviewed so far recognizes that Parmenides\nwas the first philosopher rigorously to distinguish what must be, what\nmust not be, and what is but need not be. \nIn the crucial fragment 2, the goddess says she will describe for\nParmenides “which ways of inquiry alone there are for\nunderstanding” (fr. 2.2). The common construal of this phrase as\ntantamount to the only conceivable ways of inquiry has been\none of the principal spurs for readings according to which only two,\nnot three, paths feature in the poem, for it is natural to wonder how\nthe goddess can present fragment 2’s two paths as the only\nconceivable paths of inquiry and nonetheless in fragment 6 present\nstill another path, that along which mortals are said to wander.\nTwo-path interpretations respond to this apparent difficulty by\nidentifying the path of mortal inquiry with fragment 2’s second\npath (though implausibly so, as noted above, sect. 2.2).\nParmenides’ goddess in fact has good reason to distinguish the\ntwo ways of inquiry presented in fragment 2 from the way subsequently\npresented in fragment 6. The two ways of fragment 2, unlike the third\nway, are marked as ways “for understanding,” that is, for\nachieving the kind of understanding that contrasts with the\n“wandering understanding” the goddess later says is\ncharacteristic of mortals. The use of the Greek datival infinitive in\nthe phrase, “there are for understanding” (eisi\nnoêsai, fr. 2.2b; cf. Empedocles fr. 3.12 for the identical\nconstruction) distinguishes the two ways introduced in this fragment\nfrom the one subsequently introduced in fragment 6, as ways\nfor understanding. That the goal is specifically\nunderstanding that does not wander becomes clear when she\nsubsequently presents the third way as one followed by “mortals\nwho know nothing” (fr. 6.4), which leads to “wandering\nunderstanding” (plagkton nöon, fr. 6.6).\nComparison with fr. 8.34–6a’s retrospective indication\nthat “understanding” (noêma, to\nnoein), by which is apparently meant trustworthy thought (cf. fr.\n8.50), has itself been a major goal of the inquiry suggests that a way\nfor understanding is one along which this goal of attaining\ntrustworthy understanding might be achieved. \nThe two ways of inquiry that lead to thought that does not wander are:\n“that [it] is and that [it] is not not to be” (fr.\n2.3)—i.e., “that [it] is and that [it] cannot not\nbe”—and “that [it] is not and that [it] must not\nbe” (fr. 2.5). Each verse appears to demarcate a distinct\nmodality or way of being. One might find it natural to call these\nmodalities, respectively, the modality of necessary being and the\nmodality of necessary non-being or impossibility. Parmenides conceives\nof these modalities as ways of being or ways an entity might be rather\nthan as logical properties. If one respects the organizing metaphor of\nthe ways of inquiry, one can, even at this stage of the goddess’\nrevelation, appreciate what it means for “that [it] is and that\n[it] cannot not be” to define a way of inquiry. This\nspecification indicates that what Parmenides is looking for is what is\nand cannot not be—or, more simply, what must be. Pursuing this\nway of inquiry requires maintaining a constant focus on the modality\nof the object of his search as he tries to attain a fuller conception\nof what an entity that is and cannot not be, or that must be, must be\nlike. To remain on this path Parmenides must resolutely reject any\nconception of the object of his search that proves incompatible with\nits mode of being, as the goddess reminds him at numerous points. \nWhat one looks for along this path of inquiry is what is and cannot\nnot be, or, more simply, what must be. It is therefore appropriate to\nthink of the first path as the path of necessary being and of what\nlies along it as what is (what it is) necessarily. What is and cannot\nnot be will be whatever is (what it is) actually throughout the\nhistory of this world. Likewise, what is not and must not be will be\nwhatever is not (anything) actually at any moment in the world’s\nhistory. There are of course other ways for things to be, but not,\naccording to Parmenides, other ways for things to be such that\napprehension of them will figure as understanding that does not\nwander. The second way is introduced alongside the first because the\nmodality of necessary non-being or impossibility specified in fr. 2.5\nis just as constant and invariable as the modality of necessary being\nspecified in fr. 2.3. Whatever thought there may be about what lies\nalong this second way will be unwavering and, as such, will contrast\nwith the wandering thought typical of mortals. Even if the effort to\nthink about what lies along the second way ends (as it does) in a\ntotal failure of apprehension, this non-apprehension remains\nunwavering. Inquiry along the second way involves, first, keeping in\nmind that what one is looking for is not and must not be, and thereby\ntrying to discover what an entity that is in this way must be like. It\nis immediately evident, though, what an entity that is not and must\nnot be is like: nothing at all. The goddess warns Parmenides not to\nset out on the second way because there is no prospect of finding or\nforming any conception of what must not be. She thus tells Parmenides\nat fr. 2.6 that this is a path where nothing at all can be learned by\ninquiry. \nPaying proper attention to the modal clauses in the goddess’\nspecification of the first two ways of inquiry enables us to\nunderstand the last two verses of fragment 2 as making a sound\nphilosophical point. She says, again, at fr. 2.7–8:\n“neither could you apprehend what is not, for it is not to be\naccomplished,/ nor could you indicate it.” Here she is warning\nParmenides against proceeding along the second way, and it should be\nclear that “what is not” (to mê eon) is the\ngoddess’ way of referring to what is in the manner specified\njust two verses above: “that [it] is not and that [it] must not\nbe” (fr. 2.5). She declares that Parmenides could neither know\nnor indicate “what is not” by way of explaining her\nassertion in the preceding verse that the second way is a way wholly\nwithout report. Thus here “what is not” (to mê\neon) serves as shorthand for “what is not and must not\nbe.” (Given the awkwardness of having to deploy the phrase\n“what is not and must not be” whenever referring to what\nenjoys the second way’s mode of being, one would expect\nParmenides to have employed such a device even if he had written in\nprose.) One cannot, in fact, form any definite conception of what is\nnot and must not be, and a fortiori one cannot indicate it in\nany way. (Try to picture a round square, or to point one out to\nsomeone else.) Parmenides has not fallen prey here to the purportedly\nparadoxical character of negative existential statements but makes a\nperfectly acceptable point about the inconceivability of what\nnecessarily is not. Any philosopher with an interest in the relation\nbetween conceivability and possibility should be prepared to recognize\nin Parmenides’ assertion that you could neither apprehend nor\nindicate what is not (and must not be) one of the earliest instances\nof a form of inference—that from inconceivability to\nimpossibility—that continues to occupy a central position in\nmetaphysical reasoning. \nBefore undertaking to guide Parmenides toward a fuller conception of\nwhat is and cannot not be, the goddess properly warns him away from a\nthird possible path of inquiry in fragments 6 and 7, while at the same\ntime reminding him of the imperative to think of what is in the manner\nspecified in fr. 2.3 only as being (what it is). Fragment 6 begins\nwith the goddess instructing Parmenides that it is necessary to say\nand think that “What Is” (to eon) is,\nand that he is not to think of it as not being. (Here to eon\nfunctions as a shorthand designation for what is in the way specified\nin fr. 2.3, that is, what is and cannot not be, paralleling fr.\n2.7’s use of to mê eon or “what is\nnot” as shorthand for what is in the way specified in fr. 2.5,\nthat is, what is not and must not be.) This is her essential directive\nto Parmenides regarding how to pursue the first path of inquiry. The\ngoddess also indicates in this fragment that the second major phase of\nher revelation will proceed along the path typically pursued by\nmortals whose reliance upon sensation has yielded only wandering\nunderstanding. She provides what amounts to a modal specification of\nthis path of inquiry when she describes mortals as supposing\n“that it is and is not the same/ and not the same” (fr.\n6.8–9a). The sense of this difficult clause seems to be that\nmortals mistakenly suppose that an object of genuine understanding may\nbe subject to the variableness implicit in their conception of it as\nbeing and not being the same, and being and not being not the same.\nThis is not to say that the things upon which ordinary humans have\nexclusively focused their attention, because of their reliance upon\nsensation, do not exist. It is merely to say that they do not\nenjoy the mode of necessary being required of an object of unwandering\nunderstanding. The imagery in fr. 6.4–7 that paints mortals as\nwandering blind and helpless portrays them as having failed entirely\nto realize that there is something that must be that is available for\nthem to apprehend if only they could awaken from their stupor. Even\nso, the goddess does not say that mortals have no apprehension.\nUnderstanding that wanders is still understanding. \nThe goddess reveals to Parmenides, however, the possibility of\nachieving understanding that does not wander or that is stable and\nunchanging, precisely because its object is and cannot not be (what it\nis). The third way of inquiry can never lead to this, and thus it is\nnot presented by the goddess as a path of inquiry for understanding.\nIt directs the inquirer’s attention to things that are (what\nthey are) only contingently or temporarily: they are and then again\nare not, or they are a certain way and then again are not that way.\nThe problem with this path is not, as too many interpreters have\nunderstood it to be, that nothing exists to be discovered\nalong this way. There are innumerably many things that are (and exist)\nin the manner specified at fr. 6.8–9a (and fr. 8.40–1).\nHowever, since their being is merely contingent, Parmenides thinks\nthere can be no stable apprehension of them, no thoughts about them\nthat remain steadfast and do not wander, and thus no true or reliable\nconviction. According to Parmenides, genuine conviction cannot be\nfound by focusing one’s attention on things that are subject to\nchange. This is why he has the goddess repeatedly characterize the\ncosmology in the second phase of her revelation as deceptive or\nuntrustworthy. The modal interpretation thus makes it relatively\nstraightforward to understand the presence of the poem’s\ncosmology. It is an account of the principles, origins, and operation\nof the world’s mutable population. It is Parmenides’ own\naccount, the best he was able to provide, and one firmly in the\ntradition of Presocratic cosmology. At the same time, however,\nParmenides supposed there was more to the world than all those things\nthat have grown, now are, and will hereafter end (as he describes them\nin fragment 19). There is also what is (what it is) and cannot not be\n(what it is). \nThe first major phase of the goddess’ revelation in fragment 8\nis, on the modal interpretation, a meditation on the nature of what\nmust be. The goddess leads Parmenides to form a conception of the\nattributes whatever must be has to possess just in virtue of its mode\nof being. If one appreciates that Parmenides is concerned with\ndetermining what can be inferred about the nature or character of What\nIs simply from its mode of being, one can see that he is in fact\nentitled to the inferences he draws in the major deductions of\nfragment 8. Certainly what must be cannot have come to be, nor can it\ncease to be. Both possibilities are incompatible with its mode of\nbeing. Likewise, what must be cannot change in any respect, for this\nwould involve its not being what it is, which is also incompatible\nwith its mode of being, since what must be must be what it is. On the\nassumption, inevitable at the time, that it is a spatially extended or\nphysical entity, certain other attributes can also be inferred. What\nmust be must be free from any internal variation. Such variation would\ninvolve its being something or having a certain character in some\nplace(s) while being something else or having another character in\nothers, which is incompatible with the necessity of its (all) being\nwhat it is. For much the same reason, it must be free from variation\nat its extremity. Since the only solid that is uniform at its\nextremity is a sphere, what must be must be spherical. \nIt is difficult to see what more Parmenides could have inferred as to\nthe character of what must be simply on the basis of its modality as a\nnecessary being. In fact, the attributes of the main program have an\nunderlying systematic character suggesting they are meant to exhaust\nthe logical possibilities: What Is both must be (or exist), and it\nmust be what it is, not only temporally but also spatially. For What\nIs to be (or exist) across times is for it to be ungenerated and\ndeathless; and for it to be what it is across times is for it\nto be “still” or unchanging. For What Is to be (or exist)\neverywhere is for it to be whole. For it to be what it is at\nevery place internally is for it to be uniform; and to be so\neverywhere at its extremity is for it to be “perfect” or\n“complete.” Taken together, the attributes shown to belong\nto what must be amount to a set of perfections: everlasting existence,\nimmutability, the internal invariances of wholeness and uniformity,\nand the invariance at its extremity of being optimally shaped. What Is\nhas thus proven to be not only a necessary but, in many ways, a\nperfect entity. \nOn the modal interpretation, Parmenides may be counted a\n“generous” monist. While he reasons that there is only one\nentity that must be, he also sees that there are manifold entities\nthat are but need not be (what they are). Parmenides was a\n“generous” monist because the existence of what must be\ndoes not preclude the existence of all the things that are but need\nnot be. There are at least two options for envisaging how this is\nsupposed to be the case. Some who have understood Parmenides as a\ngenerous monist have adopted a view similar to Aristotle’s. In\nMetaphysics 1.5, Aristotle remarks that Parmenides seems to\nhave had a conception of formal unity (986b18–19),\nand he gives a compressed account of the reasoning by which he takes\nParmenides to have arrived at such a conception\n(986b27–31). Then, as already noted, he adds the\ncomment that Parmenides, being compelled to go with the phenomena, and\nsupposing that what is is one with respect to the account (sc. of\nits essence) but plural with respect to perception, posited a\nduality of principles as the basis for his account of the phenomena\n(986b27–34). Thus, for Aristotle, Parmenides held\nthat what is is one, in a strong and strict sense, but it is\nalso many (in and for perception). A number of modern interpreters\nhave also advocated some form of what amounts to the ancient\n“aspectual” view of the relation between the two phases of\nthe goddess’ revelation. (See Owens 1974 and Finkelberg 1999,\nwho explicitly position their views as heirs to that at Arist.\nMetaph. 1.5.986b27–34.) Parmenides would\ncertainly have been a generous monist if he envisioned What Is as\nconsubstantial with the cosmos’s perceptible and mutable\npopulation. But an apparently insurmountable difficulty for this\nresponse comes in the suggestive verses of fr. 4: “but behold\nthings that, while absent, are steadfastly present to thought:/ for\nyou will not cut off What Is from holding fast to What Is,/ neither\ndispersing everywhere every way in a world-order (kata\nkosmon)/ nor drawing together.” \nIt thus seems preferable to understand What Is as coterminous but not\nconsubstantial with the perceptible cosmos: it is in exactly the same\nplace where the perceptible cosmos is, but is a separate and distinct\n“substance.” (Note the parallels between fr. 8.30b-31 and\nfr. 10.5-7, as well as between fr. 8.24 and fr. 9.3.) On this view,\nWhat Is imperceptibly interpenetrates or runs through all things while\nyet maintaining its own identity distinct from theirs. Something like\nthis seems to be how Anaxagoras envisioned the relation between Mind\nand the rest of the world’s things: Mind, he says, “is now\nwhere also all the others are, in that which surrounds many things and\nin those which have accreted and in those which have separated\nout” (Anaxag. fr. 14). Parmenides’ vision of the relation\nbetween What Is and the developed cosmos, as coterminous but not\nconsubstantial, also has its analogue in Xenophanes’ conception\nof the relation between his one greatest god and the cosmos, as well\nas in Empedocles’ conception of the divinity that is the\npersistent aspect of the cosmos’ perfectly unified condition,\ndarting throughout the cosmos with its swift thought. Both appear to\nbe coterminous but not consubstantial with the cosmos they\npenetrate. \nAlthough What Is in Parmenides has its nearest analogue in these\ndivine principles, Parmenides himself never in the extant fragments\ncalls What Is divine or otherwise suggests that it is a god. Instead,\nhe develops an exhaustive conception of the attributes what must be\nhas to possess, by systematically pursuing the fundamental idea that\nwhat must be both must be or exist, and must be what it is, not only\ntemporally but also spatially. Whatever other attributes it might have\nthat cannot be understood to belong to it in one of these ways do not\nenter into Parmenides’ conception of What Is. Thus it has none\nof the features of the religious tradition’s heavenly gods that\npersist as attributes of Xenophanes’ greatest god, despite\nresembling it in other respects. If Xenophanes can be seen as a\nfounder of rational theology, then Parmenides’ distinction among\nthe principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that\nmust belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as\nthe founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct\nfrom theology.","contact.mail":"jpalmer@phil.ufl.edu","contact.domain":"phil.ufl.edu"}]
