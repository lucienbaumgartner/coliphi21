So another person cannot understand the\nlanguage.” This is not intended to cover (easily imaginable)\ncases of recording one’s experiences in a personal code, for such a\ncode, however obscure in fact, could in principle be deciphered. What\nWittgenstein had in mind is a language conceived as\nnecessarily comprehensible only to its single originator\nbecause the things which define its vocabulary are necessarily\ninaccessible to others. \n\n\nImmediately after introducing the idea, Wittgenstein goes on to argue\nthat there cannot be such a language. The importance of drawing\nphilosophers’ attention to a largely unheard-of notion and then\narguing that it is unrealizable lies in the fact that an unformulated\nreliance on the possibility of a private language is arguably\nessential to mainstream epistemology, philosophy of mind and\nmetaphysics from Descartes to versions of the representational theory\nof mind which became prominent in late twentieth century cognitive\nscience.\n\nWittgenstein’s main attack on the idea of a private language is\ncontained in §§244–271 of Philosophical\nInvestigations (though the ramifications of the matter are\nrecognizably pursued until §315). These passages, especially\nthose from §256 onwards, are now commonly known as ‘the\nprivate language argument’, despite the fact that he brings\nfurther considerations to bear on the topic in other places in his\nwritings; and despite the fact that the broader context, of\n§§243–315, does not contain a singular critique of\njust one idea, namely, a private language—rather, the passages\naddress many issues, such as privacy, identity, inner/outer relations,\nsensations as objects, and sensations as justification for sensation\ntalk, amongst others. \nNevertheless, the main argument of §§244–271 is,\napparently, readily summarized. The conclusion is that a language in\nprinciple unintelligible to anyone but its originating user is\nimpossible. The reason for this is that such a so-called language\nwould, necessarily, be unintelligible to its supposed originator too,\nfor he would be unable to establish meanings for its putative\nsigns. \nWe should, however, note that Wittgenstein himself never employs the\nphrase ‘private language argument’. And a few commentators\n(e.g., Baker 1998, Canfield 2001 pp. 377–9, Stroud 2000 p. 69)\nhave questioned the very existence in the relevant passages of a\nunified structure properly identifiable as a sustained argument. This\nsuggestion, however, depends for its plausibility on a tendentiously\nnarrow notion of argument—roughly, as a kind of proof, with\nidentifiable premisses and a firm conclusion, rather than the more\ngeneral sense which would include the exposure of a confusion through\na variety of reasoned twists and turns, of qualifications,\nweighings-up and re-thinkings—and is a reaction against some\ndrastic and artificial reconstructions of the text by earlier writers.\nNevertheless, there is a point to be made, and the summary above\nconceals, as we shall see, a very intricate discussion. \nEven among those who accept that there is a reasonably self-contained\nand straightforward private language argument to be discussed, there\nhas been fundamental and widespread disagreement over its details, its\nsignificance and even its intended conclusion, let alone over its\nsoundness. The result is that every reading of the argument (including\nthat which follows) is controversial. Some of this disagreement has\narisen because of the notorious difficulty and occasional elusiveness\nof Wittgenstein’s own text (sometimes augmented by problems of\ntranslation). But much derives from the tendency of philosophers to\nread into the text their own preconceptions without making them\nexplicit and asking themselves whether its author shared them. Some\ncommentators, for instance, supposing it obvious that sensations are\nprivate, have interpreted the argument as intended to show they cannot\nbe talked about; some, supposing the argument to be an obvious but\nunsustainable attempt to wrest special advantage from scepticism about\nmemory, have maintained it to be unsound because it self-defeatingly\nimplies the impossibility of public discourse as well as private; some\nhave assumed it to be a direct attack on the problem of other minds;\nsome have claimed it to commit Wittgenstein to behaviourism or\nverificationism; some have thought it to imply that language is, of\nnecessity, not merely potentially but actually social (this has come\nto be called the ‘community view’ of the argument). \nThe early history of the secondary literature is largely one of\ndisputation over these matters. Yet what these earlier commentators\nhave in common is significant enough to outweigh their differences and\nmake it possible to speak of them as largely sharing an Orthodox\nunderstanding of the argument. After the publication in 1982 of Saul\nKripke’s definitely unorthodox book, however, in which he suggested\nthat the argument poses a sceptical problem about the whole notion of\nmeaning, public or private, disputation conducted by Orthodox rules of\nengagement was largely displaced by a debate on the issues arising\nfrom Kripke’s interpretation. (However, there is overlap: Kripke\nhimself adheres to the community view of the argument’s implications,\nwith the result that renewed attention has been paid to that issue,\ndispute over which began in 1954.) Both debates, though, show a\ntendency to proceed with only the most cursory attention to the\noriginal argument which started them off. \nThis rush to judgment about what is at stake, compounded by a\nwidespread willingness to discuss commentators’ more accessible\naccounts of the text rather than confront its difficulties directly,\nhas made it hard to recover the original from the accretion of more or\nless tendentious interpretation which has grown up around it. Such a\nrecovery is one of the tasks attempted in this article. The criterion\nof success in this task which is employed here is one of coherence: a\ngood account should accommodate all of Wittgenstein’s remarks in\n§§244–271, their (not necessarily linear) ordering as\nwell as their content, and should make clear how these remarks fit\nwith the context provided by the rest of the book. (One of the\nproblems with many of the commentaries on this matter, especially the\nearlier ones, is that their writers have quarried the text for\nindividual remarks which have then been re-woven into a set of views\nsaid to be Wittgenstein’s but whose relation to the original is\ntenuous. A striking example of this approach is Norman Malcolm’s\nfamous and influential 1954 review of Philosophical\nInvestigations, which was commonly taken as an accurate\nrepresentation of Wittgenstein’s own thinking and formed the target of\nmany “refutations”.) \nInterpretation of Wittgenstein started to become even more complex at\nthe close of the twentieth century, as commentators began to focus on\nbroad questions of method. In both Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus and Philosophical\nInvestigations there is a tension between some statements that\nseem to be stating controversial philosophical positions and others\nthat seem to be saying that philosophy ought not to offer\ncontroversial theses but only work with what we already know by being\ncompetent language users embedded in human circumstances. In the\nlatter book there are passages that seem to support an\nanti-philosophical position and others that seem to offer interesting\nnew philosophical views in the process of criticizing more traditional\nphilosophical doctrines such as foundationalism and Cartesianism.\nAlong these lines, two overlapping distinctions concerning how to read\nPhilosophical Investigations have arisen: the\nresolute–substantial distinction, and the\nPyrrhonian–non-Pyrrhonian distinction. In general, the resolute\nand Pyrrhonian readings make Wittgenstein out to be an\nanti-philosopher, one who is not offering positive philosophical\ntheses to replace false ones; rather, his goal is to show the\nnonsensical nature of traditional philosophical theorizing. It is this\ngoal that is partly responsible for the unique style of\nPhilosophical Investigations (its dialogical and, at\nleast at times, anti-dogmatic, therapeutic character). On the\nsubstantial and non-Pyrrhonian readings, Wittgenstein is not only\npresenting a method for exposing the errors of traditional\nphilosophers, but also showing how philosophy should rightly be done\nand thereby offering positive philosophical views, views which must\noften be inferred or reconstructed from an elusive text.  \nThere is neither a single resolute/Pyrrhonian nor a single\nsubstantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading of Wittgenstein. Moreover, there is\nan important difference between the resolute–substantial and\nPyrrhonian–non-Pyrrhonian distinctions. The former distinction\narises from a continuing debate on how to read Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, both on its own and in relation to\nPhilosophical Investigations (see, e.g., Conant 2004 and\nMulhall 2007), and is associated with the so-called New\nWittgensteinians (see, e.g., Crary and Read 2000). The Pyrrhonian and\nnon-Pyrrhonian discussion is to be found, for example, in Fogelin\n(1994), Sluga (2004), and Stern (2004, 2007), and concerns the ways in\nwhich Wittgenstein might be considered as writing in the tradition of\nthe ancient Pyrrhonian sceptics, who were philosophically sceptical\nabout the very possibility of philosophy (see Fogelin 1994, pp. 3ff\nand 205ff). These distinctions cut across the distinction between\nOrthodox and Kripkean non-orthodox readings of the text: both Orthodox\nand Kripkean non-orthodox interpreters have tended to offer\nsubstantial or non-Pyrrhonian readings of Wittgenstein—though\nthe line may not always be clear and some (e.g., Hacker, 1990) move\nfrom a resolute/Pyrrhonian to a substantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading\nwithout remarking the fact. \nSome (Fogelin, Stern, and Mulhall, for example) have come to question\nwhether it makes sense to suppose that either one or the other,\nresolute/Pyrrhonian or substantial/non-Pyrrhonian, must be\nthe correct way to read Wittgenstein. Fogelin and Stern see\nthe tension in the text of Philosophical Investigations\nas the expression of a tension, indeed a struggle, within its\nauthor, between his wanting to uncover the ‘disguised\nnonsense’ of philosophical theses and his being tempted and\ndrawn into still other philosophical positions on the nature of\nlanguage, reference, private experience, and philosophy itself. In\nwhat is surely a reference to §133c—which reads: ‘The\nreal discovery is the one that enables me to break off philosophizing\nwhen I want to. — The one that gives philosophy peace, so that\nit is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself in\nquestion’—Wittgenstein is reported by Rush Rhees to have\nsaid ‘In my book I say that I am able to leave off with a\nproblem in philosophy when I want to. But that’s a lie; I can’t’\n(Rhees, 1984, p. 219 n. 7). According to Stern, the Wittgenstein of\nthe Philosophical Investigations is more Pyrrhonian than\nnot, while understanding all too acutely the attraction of philosophy\nand the difficulty of giving it up. One’s stance on these matters\naffects how one reads the private language sections, in particular by\nraising the question whether Wittgenstein intends to argue that the\npositive claim of the possibility of a private language is false, or\nis some kind of nonsense.  \nIf someone were to insist that a private language is possible, one way\nto argue against him would be by employing the method of reductio\nad absurdum: assume that it is true that a private language is\npossible, show that that assumption leads to certain absurdities or a\ncontradiction, and then conclude that it is actually false that a\nprivate language is possible. This is the way in which the argument\nwas typically understood. But this understanding has come into\nquestion. In contrast to his earlier commentaries, for example, Gordon\nBaker has since called into question whether the private language\nsections should not be read as attempting to show that the notion of a\nprivate language is intelligible but false, but rather that it is\nnonsense masquerading as an important possibility (Baker, 1998). \nThere is, however, in Wittgenstein’s thinking an inclination to think\nof contradiction in terms of the disintegration of sense, so that even\nargument by reductio might be understood not in terms of\nfalsehood. (The appearance of this inclination in Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, for example, is well mapped by Fogelin\n[1995, Ch. IV].) And it is characteristic of Wittgenstein to talk of\nphilosophical error in terms of nonsense. In §119 of\nPhilosophical Investigations he writes, e.g., ‘The\nresults of philosophy are the discovery of some piece of plain\nnonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running up\nagainst the limits of language. They — these bumps —\nmake us see the value of that discovery.’ And in §464:\n‘What I want to teach is: to pass from unobvious nonsense to\nobvious nonsense.’ In the discussion of the possibility of a\nprivate language it may well at first seem as though we understand the\npossibility under consideration. After all we seem to understand the\nquestion in §256, ‘Now, what about the language which\ndescribes my inner experiences and which only I myself can\nunderstand?’ But is Wittgenstein suggesting we only\nseem to understand this question?  \nThe matter may not be clear. Shortly after the main private language\nsections, the following remark occurs as part of a dialogue, ‘It\namounts to this: that only of a living human being and what resembles\n(behaves like) a living human being can one say: it has sensations; it\nsees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious’\n(§281). The dialogue continues in §282: \n“But in a fairy tale a pot too can see and hear!”\n(Certainly; but it can also talk.) \n“But a fairy tale only invents what is not the case: it does not\ntalk nonsense, does it?” — It’s not as simple as\nthat. Is it untrue or nonsensical to say that a pot talks? Does one\nhave a clear idea of the circumstances in which we’d say of a pot that\nit talked? (Even a nonsense poem is not nonsense in the same way as\nthe babble of a baby.) \nHere the question of how the Investigations is to be read\nintrudes. For example, part of the distinction between what Mulhall\ncalls resolute and substantial readings of Wittgenstein concerns the\nsense in which Wittgenstein aimed to ‘overcome our attraction to\nthe idea that there is something that we cannot do in\nphilosophy’ (Mulhall, 2007, p. 8; cf. Philosophical\nInvestigations §374). Mulhall claims that that idea goes\nagainst the moral of Investigations §500:\n‘When a sentence is called senseless, it is not, as it were, its\nsense that is senseless. Rather, a combination of words is being\nexcluded from the language, withdrawn from circulation.’\nFurther, this substantial reading attributes to Wittgenstein an\nimplicit philosophical theory of meaning, ‘of the (now\ngrammatical) conditions of sense—quite as if our everyday\nabilities to distinguish sense from nonsense require at the very least\na philosophical grounding or foundation (perhaps a criterial\nsemantics, or a theory of language-games, or an anthropology of the\nhuman life form’ (Mulhall, 2007, p. 9). By contrast, on a\nresolute reading of Philosophical Investigations,\nWittgenstein’s appeal to the notion of a grammatical investigation\ninvolves the deployment of ‘our everyday capacity to distinguish\nsense from nonsense in a philosophical context, and hence as depriving\nitself of any claim to expertise or authority that exceeds that form\nof practical ability—an ability that can equally well be laid\nclaim to by any competent speaker, and hence by any philosophical\ninterlocutor’ (ibid., p. 10). Further, the resolute reading is\nespecially firm in rejecting the idea that there is something\ndeterminate that we cannot do, the idea that there is something,\nnamely, a private language, that cannot be achieved; there is not a\nlimitation on language. Rather, the idea is simply nonsense, or as\nMulhall later puts it (ibid. p. 18): no sense can be given to the idea\nof a philosophically substantial private language. \nThough Mulhall claims that the private language sections can\njustifiably be read either resolutely or substantially—because\n‘each reading can … point to an aspect of the text that\nit fully acknowledges, and whose proper acknowledgment by the other is\nat the very least an issue for it, it would seem profitless to insist\nthat one reading is essentially faithful to Wittgenstein’s text and\nthe other intrinsically faithless’ (ibid., p. 20)—it is\nplain that he thinks the resolute reading is to be preferred. However,\nwe may not need to choose. We might view the private language sections\nas Wittgenstein’s asking, ‘Do we have a clear picture of the\ncircumstances in which we should say that someone spoke a private\nlanguage?’ The line of reasoning that follows §243 can be\nread as various attempts to achieve a clear picture of what it might\nmean to speak a private language, where the attempts ultimately fail,\nwith the result that what at first sight seemed intelligible (‘a\nlanguage which describes my inner experiences and which only I myself\ncan understand’) turns out not to be intelligible after all. And\nin so far as we cannot make intelligible the circumstances in which\nthere could be a private language, we should say that the idea of a\nprivate language is nonsense. However, as we saw above, in §282\nWittgenstein seems to suggest that the border between nonsense and\nfalsehood is itself unclear; and moreover, in trying to make sense of\nthe possibility of a private language, we may find, in different parts\nof the chain of reasoning, suggestions of falsehood as well as of\nnonsensicality.  \nThe issue’s significance can be seen by considering how the argument\nis embedded in the structure of Philosophical Investigations.\nImmediately prior to the introduction of the argument\n(§§241f), Wittgenstein suggests that the existence of the\nrules governing the use of language and making communication possible\ndepends on agreement in human behaviour—such as the uniformity\nin normal human reaction which makes it possible to train most\nchildren to look at something by pointing at it. (Unlike cats, which\nreact in a seemingly random variety of ways to pointing.) One function\nof the private language argument is to show that not only actual\nlanguages but the very possibility of language and concept formation\ndepends on the possibility of such agreement. \nAnother, related, function is to oppose the idea that metaphysical\nabsolutes are within our reach, that we can find at least part of the\nworld as it really is in the sense that any other way of conceiving\nthat part must be wrong (cf. Philosophical Investigations\np. 230). Philosophers are especially tempted to suppose that numbers\nand sensations are examples of such absolutes, self-identifying\nobjects which themselves force upon us the rules for the use of their\nnames. Wittgenstein discusses numbers in earlier sections on rules\n(185–242). Some of his points have analogues in his discussion\nof sensations, for there is a common underlying confusion about how\nthe act of meaning determines the future application of a formula or\nname. In the case of numbers, one temptation is to confuse the\nmathematical sense of ‘determine’ in which, say, the\nformula y = 2x determines the numerical value of\ny for a given value of x (in contrast with\ny > 2x, which does not) with a causal sense in\nwhich a certain training in mathematics determines that normal people\nwill always write the same value for y given both the first\nformula and a value for x—in contrast with creatures\nfor which such training might produce a variety of outcomes (cf.\n§189). This confusion produces the illusion that the result of an\nactual properly conducted calculation is the inevitable outcome of the\nmathematical determining, as though the formula’s meaning itself were\nshaping the course of events. \nIn the case of sensations, the parallel temptation is to suppose that\nthey are self-intimating. Itching, for example, seems like this: one\njust feels what it is directly; if one then gives the sensation a\nname, the rules for that name’s subsequent use are already determined\nby the sensation itself. Wittgenstein tries to show that this\nimpression is illusory, that even itching derives its identity only\nfrom a sharable practice of expression, reaction and use of language.\nIf itching were a metaphysical absolute, forcing its identity upon me\nin the way described, then the possibility of such a shared practice\nwould be irrelevant to the concept of itching: the nature of itching\nwould be revealed to me in a single mental act of naming it (the kind\nof mental act which Russell called ‘acquaintance’); all\nsubsequent facts concerning the use of the name would be irrelevant to\nhow that name was meant; and the name could be private. The private\nlanguage argument is intended to show that such subsequent facts could\nnot be irrelevant, that no names could be private, and that the notion\nof having the true identity of a sensation revealed in a single act of\nacquaintance is a confusion. \nThe suggestion that a language could be private in the way described\nappears most openly in the second of Bertrand Russell’s published\nlectures ‘The Philosophy of Logical Atomism’, where\nRussell says: \nIn a logically perfect language, there will be one word and no more\nfor every simple object, and everything that is not simple will be\nexpressed by a combination of words, by a combination derived, of\ncourse, from the words for the simple things that enter in, one word\nfor each simple component. A language of that sort will be completely\nanalytic, and will show at a glance the logical structure of the facts\nasserted or denied. … A logically perfect language, if it could\nbe constructed, would not only be intolerably prolix, but, as regards\nits vocabulary, would be very largely private to one speaker. That is\nto say, all the names that it would use would be private to that\nspeaker and could not enter into the language of another speaker. \n… A name, in the narrow logical sense of a word whose meaning\nis a particular, can only be applied to a particular with which the\nspeaker is acquainted, because you cannot name anything you are not\nacquainted with. \n… One can use ‘this’ as a name to stand for a\nparticular with which one is acquainted at the moment. We say\n‘This is white’. … But if you try to apprehend the\nproposition that I am expressing when I say ‘This is\nwhite’, you cannot do it. If you mean this piece of chalk as a\nphysical object, then you are not using a proper name. It is only when\nyou use ‘this’ quite strictly, to stand for an actual\nobject of sense [i.e., a sense-datum], that it is really a proper\nname. And in that it has a very odd property for a proper name, namely\nthat it seldom means the same thing two moments running and does not\nmean the same thing to the speaker and to the hearer. \n… [I]n order to understand a name for a particular, the only\nthing necessary is to be acquainted with that particular. When you are\nacquainted with that particular, you have a full, adequate and\ncomplete understanding of the name, and no further information is\nrequired. \nAlthough Wittgenstein does not explicitly say so, it is likely that\nthis is the inspiration of his argument: his writing is marked in many\nplaces by criticism of Russell, both explicit and otherwise.  \nIn this context, we should take a moment to note a set of issues of\nincreasing interest, namely, ones found in Cora Diamond’s claim in\n‘Does Bismarck Have a Beetle In His Box’ that: \nThe Tractatus provides us with arguments against the\nRussellian idea of someone else’s private object, the beetle in\nBismarck’s box. It lets us see that any such beetle would have no role\nin language or thought, but it left unmolested the beetle in one’s own\nbox. Russell’s conception of how we can think about things in the\nminds of others was subjected to a critique, but the\nTractatus left unexamined a questionable conception of what\nit is for our words to be about things in our own minds. (p. 283) \nIt would not be until post-Tractarian work that Wittgenstein would\nturn his attention to question of private objects in one’s own\nmind.  Regarding Russell, as Diamond sees it, his commitment both to\nprivate objects and their possibility/admissibility comes primarily\nfrom his views on knowledge by acquaintance in contrast to knowledge\nby description, an important part of which is his holding that\n“…the chief importance of knowledge by description is\nthat it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private\nexperience. In spite of the fact that we can only know truths which\nare wholly composed of terms which we have experienced in\nacquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by description of things which\nwe have never experienced” (quoted in Diamond [2000],\np. 267). Further, according to Diamond, it is Russell’s\nunderstanding and use of quantification that he employs to provide a\nway to get around the problem of not being acquainted with the\n‘private’ objects in the minds of others. While Bismarck\nknows by direct acquaintance the meaning of ‘This is\nexcruciating’ said of his sensation, another can only say,\n‘Bismarck’s sensation is excruciating’. However,\nthis can be meaningful once we understand that the its meaning is to\nbe analyzed in terms of, ‘Something is a sensation, had now by\nBismarck, and it is excruciating’ (p. 273). Once she has\nidentified the importance of the issue of privacy for Russell, and\nlaid out the details of his position, she is primarily concerned to\nshow how Wittgenstein’s views in the Tractatus\n(particularly on quantification, logical space, and there not being\nlogical objects that serve as the referents of terms such as\n‘some’ and ‘all’) undermine Russell’s\nposition on quantification and private objects in other people’s\nminds. Further, she argues, briefly, for the importance of there being\na ‘private language argument’ in the\nTractatus along two main lines. First, she takes it to be\nimportant for our understanding of Wittgenstein’s work and its\ndevelopment (and here her argument is firmly in line with her\nPyrrhonian and resolute reading of the Tractatus and its\ncontinuity with Wittgenstein’s later work). Second, she takes it to\nhave implications for Michael Dummett’s way of framing the realism and\nanti-realism issue, especially as it relates to the\nTractatus. Against Dummett, she sees the Tractatus\nas putting forward an anti-realist position, “…at any\nrate about other people’s private objects” (p. 284). \nAs this entry is focused on the private language considerations found\nprimarily in the Philosophical Investigations, we will not go\ninto further detail regarding Diamond’s argument. However, as\nnoted above, the issues she raises are of increasing interest both\ndirectly and indirectly. Directly, they are engaged by William\nChild’s recent ’Does the Tractatus contain a\nprivate language argument?’ in which he argues that Diamond is\nmore or less wrong across the board in her main contentions regarding\nthere being a private language argument in the Tractatus and\nher assessment of the Tractatus as anti-realist. His central\ncontention is that Diamond projects views attributable to the later\nWittgenstein into the Tractatus, particularly those\nconcerning naming and use. However, he also argues that\nWittgenstein’s 1929 views on sensation language\n‘challenge’ ‘new’ readings of\nthe Tractatus, such as Diamond’s, where by ‘new\nreadings’ he means ones that, “find in\nthe Tractatus an absence of positive philosophical doctrines,\na kind of quietism, and an explicitly therapeutic approach that have\ntraditionally been associated with Wittgenstein’s later\nphilosophy” (p. 143).  \nIndirectly, Diamond’s piece is in line with an increasing interest in\nquestions of how to read Wittgenstein, such as those we noted above in\nour discussion of the resolute-substantial and\nPyrrhonian-non-Pyrrhonian ‘Wittgensteins’. The issues raised in these\ncontexts have further relevance for understanding other central\nWittgensteinian themes such as how best to respond to the temptations\nof solipsism (see Stern [2010] for a helpful overview of many of these\nissues; he does not discuss Diamond directly, but he does focus on the\nquestion of the development of Wittgenstein’s thought and, for\nexample, the question of solipsism in the context of private language\nconsiderations. Another recent example of interest in Wittgenstein’s\nphilosophical development, and explicitly one that concerns private\nlanguage, is Nielson [2008]).  \nTo return to our exposition of the private language concerns found in\nthe Philosophical Investigations, in distinction from\nRussell’s work, for example, the idea of a private language is more\nusually hidden: the confusions supposed to belong to it allegedly\nunderlie a range of articulated philosophical notions and theories,\nwithout themselves being so articulated. The argument is thus perhaps\nmost profitably read as targeting, not any particular theory, but\nrather the motivation for considering a range of apparently\nindependent or even competing theories along with their associated\ntasks, problems and solutions. \nFor example, a still very common idea, often attributed to John Locke\nand openly embraced by Jerry Fodor in the nineteen seventies, is that\ninterpersonal spoken communication works by speakers’ translation of\ntheir internal mental vocabularies into sounds followed by hearers’\nre-translation into their own internal vocabularies. Again, Descartes\nconsidered himself able to talk to himself about his experiences while\nclaiming to be justified in saying that he does not know (or not until\nhe has produced a reassuring philosophical argument) anything at all\nabout an external world conceived as something independent of them.\nAnd he and others have thought: while I may make mistakes about the\nexternal world, I can infallibly avoid error if I confine my judgments\nto my immediate sensations. (Compare The Principles of\nPhilosophy, I, 9.) Again, many philosophers, including John\nStuart Mill, have supposed there to be a problem of other minds,\naccording to which I may reasonably doubt the legitimacy of applying,\nsay, sensation-words to beings other than myself. \nIn each of these examples, the implication is that the internal\nvehicle of my musings could in principle be private (as Kenny [1966,\np. 369] showed, this vehicle does not have to be a language\nfor the argument to apply to it): for these problems and theories even\nto make sense, sharability must be irrelevant to meaning and it must\nbe at least conceivable that my knowledge, even my understanding, is\nnecessarily confined to my own case. The implication is of course\noften denied. The terms of Fodor’s language of thought, for example,\nare supposed to be able to refer to public objects. But the question\nis, on what basis does this ability rest? However this question should\nbe answered, Fodor himself was concerned enough about Wittgenstein’s\nargument to try to show both that it did not apply to his views\nand—apparently superfluously—that it is not a good\nargument anyway (Fodor pp. 68–73). The matter is clearer with\nDescartes (compare Kenny 1966): for his sceptical question to be\nraised without being immediately self-defeating, he must hold it\npossible to identify his experiences inwardly—where\n‘inwardly’ means without relying on resources supplied by\nhis essential embodiment in a world whose existence is independent of\nhis own mind and accessible to others (e.g., such resources as the\nconcepts acquired in a normal upbringing). The question which\naccordingly looms large in the private language argument is: How is\nthis identification of one’s experiences to be achieved? \nHowever, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the significance of\nthe private language argument does not rest on the scholarly detail of\nwhether this or that thinker can be correctly described as committed\nto the idea. The target is a way of thinking which generates\nphilosophical theories, not the theories themselves. \nAs already noted, the private language sections of Philosophical\nInvestigations are usually held to begin at §243 (though\nwe shall see that Wittgenstein relies on points made much earlier in\nthe book). The methodological issues canvassed above arise at the\noutset, in the interpretation of §243’s crucial second\nparagraph. \nOn a substantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading, Wittgenstein begins to\nclarify what kind of philosophically important notion of private\nlanguage is to be examined, i.e., one that is necessarily private and\nwhich refers to one’s immediate private sensations. In the remarks\nthat follow, Wittgenstein argues that the idea of such a private\nlanguage is nonsensical or incoherent because it is a violation of\ngrammar (i.e., Wittgenstein draws on his substantive views on\nmeaning).  \nOn a resolute/Pyrrhonian reading, it is emphasized that the reader is\nasked in the first sentence of the second paragraph whether one can\nactually imagine a language for one’s inner experiences, for\nprivate use. Wittgenstein at this point reminds the interlocutor that\nwe already use ordinary language for that. But the interlocutor\nquickly replies in the last three lines of §243 that what he is\nasking is whether we can imagine a private language that refers to\nwhat only the speaker can know. In the following sections,\nWittgenstein examines ‘whether there is a way of meaning the\nwords of the penultimate sentence [of §243] that does not simply\nreturn us to a banality, whether in fact his interlocutor means\nanything in particular with those words’ (Mulhall 2007, p. 18).\nThe question is whether the notion of a language ‘which only I\nmyself can understand’ can be given any substantial meaning to\nbegin with. On this latter reading, §§258 and 270, for\nexample, are attempts to give the interlocutor what he says he wants,\nbut which, in the end, amount to nothing (in the case of 258) or bring\nus back to a publicly understandable language (in the case of\n270). \nAs we saw above, in section 1.2, it is not clear that we must choose\nbetween these two readings. On either, the point of the private\nlanguage argument is that the idea is exposed as unintelligible when\npressed—we cannot make sense of the circumstances in which we\nshould say that someone is using a private language. \nSo, having introduced the idea of a private language in the way\nalready quoted, Wittgenstein goes on to argue in a preliminary\ndiscussion (§§244–255) that there are two senses of\n‘private’ which a philosopher might have in mind in\nsuggesting that sensations are private, and that sensations as they\nare talked about in natural languages (such as English and German) are\nin fact private in neither of them. He then turns, at §256, to\nthe question whether there could be a private language at all. He\ncontinues to talk of sensations, and of pain as an example, but one\nshould remember that these are not our sensations, the\neveryday facts of human existence, but the supposed exemplars of\nphilosophical accounts of the everyday facts. Thus, for\ninstance, they might be the sensations of something like a Cartesian\nsoul (perhaps one associated with a physical body, as indicated in\n§§257 and 283), something which has no publicly available\nmental life and whose “experiences” are accordingly\nprivate. (It is worth noting that the earlier Anscombe translation is\nmisleading here: in §243, for example, where the idea of a\nprivate language is introduced, it loses the crucial contrast, so\nevident in the original German, between the ordinary human beings\ndescribed as solitary speakers in the first paragraph and the second\nparagraph’s mysterious ‘one’ who is the\n‘speaker’ of a private language and whose nature is\ncarefully left unclear. See the recent 4th edition translation of this\nparagraph, a relevant part is in the first sentence of this article,\nto find a version closer to the original German.) Consistent with this\npoint is that in §256 Wittgenstein suggests that one cannot\narrive at the idea of a private language by considering a natural\nlanguage: natural languages are not private, for our sensations are\nexpressed. But neither can we arrive at the idea by starting with a\nnatural language and just subtracting from it all expression of\nsensations (temporary paralysis is clearly not in question), as he\nconsiders next, for as he says in §257, even if there could be\nlanguage in such a situation as this where teaching is impossible, the\nearlier argument of Philosophical Investigations\n(§§33–35), concerning ostensive definition, has shown\nthat mere “mental association” of one thing with another\nis not alone enough to make the one into a name of the other. Naming\none’s sensation requires a place for the new word: that is, a notion\nof sensation. The attempt to name a sensation in a conceptual vacuum\nmerely raises the questions of what this business is supposed to\nconsist in, and what is its point. But, for the sake of\ngetting to the heart of the matter, Wittgenstein puts the first of\nthese questions on one side and pretends that it is sufficient for the\nsecond to imagine himself in the position of establishing a private\nlanguage for the purpose of keeping a diary of his sensations. \nHowever, to investigate the possibility of the imagined diary case by\nexploring it from the inside (the only way, he thinks, really to\nexpose the confusions involved) requires him to use certain words when\nit is just the right to use these words which is in question. Thus he\nis forced to mention in §258 examples like ostensive definition,\nconcentrating the attention, speaking, writing, remembering, believing\nand so on, in the very process of suggesting that none of these can\nreally occur in the situation under consideration (§261). \nThis difficulty has often gone unnoticed by commentators on the\nargument, with particularly unhappy results for the understanding of\nthe discussion of the diary example. Fogelin [1976], for instance, a\nparadigm representative of Orthodoxy, treats this as a case where\nhe himself, a living embodied human being, keeps a diary and\nrecords the occurrences of a sensation which he finds it impossible to\ndescribe to anyone else. But we are not to assume that the description\nof the keeping of the diary is a description of a possible or even\nultimately intelligible case. In particular, we are not to think of\nsuch a human being’s keeping a real diary, but of something like the\nCartesian internal equivalent. It is thus vital to the argument that\nthe diary case is presented in the first person, without our pressing\nthe question, ‘Who is speaking?’ At this stage we are\nsimply not to worry about whether the diary story ultimately makes\nsense or not. But the fact that it may not make sense must be\nremembered in reading what follows, which in strictness should\nconstantly be disfigured with scare quotes. (We shall, as we have\nalready, occasionally supply them as a reminder, reserving double\nquotes for this purpose.) \nTo summarize the argument’s preliminary stage: In §256\nWittgenstein asked of the “private language”,\n‘How do I use words to signify my sensations?’,\nand reminded us in §257 that we cannot answer ‘As we\nordinarily do’. So this question, which is the same question as\n‘How do I obtain meaning for the expressions in a “private\nlanguage”?’ is still open; and the answer must be\nindependent of our actual connections between words and\nsensations. In the attempt to arrive at an answer, and explore the\nquestion in its full depth, he temporarily allows the use of the\nnotions of sensation and diary-keeping (despite the objections of\n§257), and imagines himself in the position of a private linguist\nrecording his sensations in a diary. The aim is to show that even if\nthis concession is made, meaning for a sensation-word still cannot be\nsecured and maintained by such a linguist. The crucial central part of\nthe argument begins here, at §258. \nWittgenstein points out in the diary case ‘I first want to\nobserve that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated’.\n(The translation here obscures the reason why. Wittgenstein’s word is\n‘aussprechen’, better translated as\n‘expressed’ than ‘formulated’: the point\nfollows by definition from the fact that the case is one where the\ndefinition is private.) So if meaning is to be obtained for the\n“sign”, this must be achieved through a private exercise\nof ostensive definition, where I concentrate on the sensation and\nproduce the sign at the same time. (In these circumstances, meaning\ncannot be extracted from a pre-existing practice of private use, since\nwhat is in question is how such a use could be established in the\nfirst place.) But if this exercise is to be genuine and successful\nostensive definition, it must establish the connection\nbetween sign and sensation, and this connection must persist.\nAs Wittgenstein says, ‘“I commit [the connection] to\nmemory” can only mean: this process brings it about that I\nremember the connection correctly in the future’. For I\ndo not define anything, even to myself let alone anyone else, by\nmerely attending to something and making a mark, unless this episode\nhas the appropriate consequences. \nAt this point we should suspend our exposition of the argument, in\norder to examine closely the remark ‘this process brings it\nabout that I remember the connection correctly in the\nfuture’. \nThis remark has usually been interpreted as a demand that, for the\nsign ‘S’ to have been given a meaning, it must\nalways figure thereafter (if used affirmatively and sincerely) as a\ntrue statement: that is, I must use the sign ‘S’\naffirmatively only when I really do have the sensation S. And\nit has usually been thought that the subsequent argument concerns the\nadequacy of memory to ensure that I do not later misidentify my\nsensations and call a different kind of sensation\n‘S’ in the future. This account of the argument\nand its history is summed up by Anthony Kenny as follows: \nMany philosophers have taken ‘I remember the connection\nright’ to mean ‘I use “S” when and\nonly when I really have S’. They then take\nWittgenstein’s argument to be based on scepticism about memory: how\ncan you be sure that you have remembered aright when next you call a\nsensation ‘S’? … \nCritics of Wittgenstein have found the argument, so interpreted, quite\nunconvincing. Surely, they say, the untrustworthiness of memory\npresents no more and no less a problem for the user of a private\nlanguage than for the user of a public one. No, Wittgenstein’s\ndefenders have said, for memory-mistakes about public objects may be\ncorrected, memory-mistakes about private sensations cannot; and where\ncorrection is impossible, talk of correctness is out of place. At this\npoint critics of Wittgenstein have either denied that truth demands\ncorrigibility, or have sought to show that checking is possible in the\nprivate case too. (Kenny[ 1973] pp. 191–2) \nThis interplay of criticism and defence characterizes the Orthodox\ninterpretation of the argument. (See Fogelin [1976], pp. 162–4,\nfor a good example.) There seem to be at least two reasons why this\ninterpretation should have become established. First, philosophers\ncommitted to the idea of a private language are often looking for an\narrangement in which mistakes of fact are impossible; that is, they\nare trying to overcome scepticism by finding absolute certainty.\n(Descartes is the example usually cited.) And this would make\nsceptical arguments appear to be natural weapons to use in reply to\nthem. (See, e.g., Fogelin [1976] p. 153.) Secondly, it is\nplausible—which is not the same as correct—to suppose that\none cannot be mistaken concerning the natures of one’s present\nsensations, and a supposed proof that the idea of a private language\nentails that one is just as fallible on this subject as on any other\ncould thus seem crippling to that idea. \nBut, as Kenny first showed, the question of factual infallibility in\nfuture uses of the sign ‘S’ is not the issue. If\nwe look closely at §258, we see that ‘I remember the\nconnection correctly’ refers to remembering a\nmeaning, namely, the meaning of the sign\n‘S’, not to making sure that I infallibly apply\n‘S’ only to S’s in the future. (Nor does\nthe private language argument depend on taking the latter to be an\neffect of the former.) \nNow that we are clearer about what the connection is which has to be\nremembered right, we can return to the exposition of the argument. I\nam to imagine that I am a private linguist. I have a sensation, and\nmake the mark ‘S’ at the same time, as I might in\nan ordinary case introduce a sign by ostensive definition. Afterwards,\nI “believe” myself to have established a meaning for this\nsign ‘S’, and I now use it to judge that I am\nagain experiencing the same sensation. What do I mean by\n‘S’ on this second occasion? Wittgenstein\nconsiders two possible answers. \nOne of the answers is that what I mean by ‘S’ is\njust the sort of sensation I am now having. Of this Wittgenstein says\nmerely: \nThe point is highly condensed. Here is a more explicit version. For\nthere to be factual assertion, there must be the distinction between\ntruth and falsehood, between saying what is the case and saying what\nis not. For there to be the distinction between truth and falsehood,\nthere must be a further distinction between the source of the meaning,\nand the source of the truth, of what is said. Suppose that I confront\nsome object and say of it ‘This is S’. If I must\nalso appeal to this very object to make this utterance intelligible to\nmyself, I deprive it of any claim to the status of factual\nassertion—it becomes, at best, ostensive definition. (The\n‘at best’ is important here, for the same reason that the\ndiary example is not to be assumed genuinely possible.) \nThe second answer Wittgenstein considers to the question of what I\nmean by ‘S’ is this: I mean by\n‘S’, not this current sensation, but the\nsensation I named ‘S’ in the past. We have\nalready seen, in Kenny’s rejection of the Orthodox reading of the\nargument, that scepticism about memory has no place in the discussion\nof “private language”; the text simply does not support\nit. But at this point we must break with Kenny too. For according to\nhis account the crucial claim becomes: ‘If it is possible for me\nto misremember my previous ostensive definition of\n“S”, then I do not really know what\n“S” means.’ (See, e.g., Kenny [1973] p.\n194.) This is just conventional scepticism about memory extended to\ninclude meanings as well as judgments. And it is an elementary point\nof epistemology that knowing something does not obviously entail just\nas a result of the definition of knowledge that it is\nimpossible for one to be wrong about that thing, only that\none is not in fact wrong. \nWhat has gone wrong? The answer is that Kenny’s and the Orthodox\naccounts share an unnoticed assumption: that even in the circumstances\nof the “private language” there is actually an application\nof a sign to a private sensation by a private linguist. The problem as\nKenny then conceives it is one of later remembering this earlier\napplication in order that ‘S’ should have\nretained its meaning. The question then seems to be whether one’s\nadmittedly fallible memory is adequate for the maintenance of meaning.\nBut why should this assumption be allowed? What entitles us to assume\nthat a private linguist could even ostensively define his sign to\nhimself in the first place? As we have seen, this is one of the\nmatters in question; and §§260 and 261 show that\nWittgenstein was not prepared to let an argument in favour of private\nlanguage proceed from this assumption. In these two sections\nWittgenstein reminds us that his arguments in the earlier sections\n(e.g., 33–35) of Philosophical Investigations showed\nthat ostensive definition was not achieved by any performance unless\ncertain circumstantial conditions are fulfilled; and nothing about the\ndiary case as so far described shows them to be fulfilled. It is only\nlater (§§270–271) that Wittgenstein imagines a partial\nfulfilment of them, and the result there is to render the language\npublic. \nOne cause of the muddle is Wittgenstein’s insistence that there must\nbe a distinction between obeying a rule and merely thinking that one\nhas. This does not result, as the Orthodox have supposed, in a demand\nfor, and eventual rejection of, ‘memory-infallibility in a\nprivate language’: demand and rejection being based respectively\non the grounds that without infallibility one could always be going\nwrong and would never know if one were, and with infallibility one\nwould collapse the distinction between obeying a rule and merely\nthinking one was obeying it. Rather, the argument is this. The private\nlinguist cannot legislate a meaning for a sign by “private\nostensive definition” merely—for this has to\nestablish a technique of using the sign (§260). The technique\ncannot function by means of repeated “ostensive\ndefinitions”, as we saw in examining the first answer, since\nthis collapses the distinction between meaning and truth and thus\ndestroys the possibility of making factual judgments. So the so-called\n“definition” has on some other basis to establish a\nconstancy in use of the sign. \nBut this is just what is in question. What would be constancy\nhere? What would be using the sign in the same way as before?\nHow was the sign used in the first place? As there cannot be\nassumed to be a way of using the sign which the linguist succeeds even\nin determining, let alone establishing, and which is the correct way,\nindependent of the linguist’s later impression of the correct way,\nthen a defender of “private language” would have to show\nthat there was. It might now seem as if one could show this by\nappealing to the private linguist’s memory. He simply remembers how he\nused the sign before. And this looks straightforward enough, because\none thinks: he certainly did something before, for he remembers it.\nAnd we do not require his memory to be infallible. But the memory does\nat least have to be a memory: that is, accurate or not, it\nhas to be of something determinate which existed independently of the\nmemory of it; and the “memory” alone cannot bring such a\nthing into existence. \nThis is the argument of §265, which has often been mistakenly\ngiven an epistemological interpretation. Again we cannot assume that\nthere has been an actual table (even a mental one) of meanings in the\ncase of the private linguist, a table which is now recalled and about\nwhich the linguist must rely on recall since the original has gone.\nRather, as §§260–264 show, there may be nothing\ndeterminate other than this “remembering of the table”. So\nwhen we think that a private linguist could remember the meaning of\n‘S’ by remembering a past correlation of the sign\n‘S’ with a sensation, we are supposing what needs\nto be itself established—that there was indeed some independent\ncorrelation to be remembered. Fallibility of memory, even of memory of\nmeaning, is neither here nor there: the point is not that there is\ndoubt now about the trustworthiness of memory, but that there\nwas doubt then about the status of what occurred. And this\noriginal, non-epistemological, doubt cannot later be removed\nby “recollections” of a status inherently dubious in the\nfirst place. That is, if there was no genuine original correlation in\nthe first place, a “memory” will not create one. But if,\nalternatively, we do not suppose that there was something independent\nof the memory to be remembered, again ‘what seems right is\nright’; the “memory” of the\n“correlation” is being employed to confirm itself, for\nthere is no independent access to the “remembered\ncorrelation”. (Not even the independent access that we have as\nposers of the example, since the question is, can we pose such an\nexample? The typical mistake commentators make here is to disguise the\nproblem by thinking of S in terms of some already established\nconcept, such as  pain, which they bring to the example\nthemselves.) This is why Wittgenstein says in §265, ‘As if\nsomeone were to buy several copies of today’s morning paper to assure\nhimself that what it said was true’. \nSo far the argument has been conducted in terms of an ‘I’\nnot essentially related to body or related only to an inert body. At\n§269, however, it moves to examples where there is bodily\nbehaviour but despite this there is still the temptation to think of\nprivate meanings for words independent of their public use. This\nsuggests a further chance for a defender of the idea of a private\nlanguage: that a private linguist might secure a meaning for his sign\n‘S’ by correlating its private use with some\npublic phenomenon. This would apparently serve to provide a function\nfor the noting of ‘S’ in the diary (§260)\nand thus give a place for ostensive definition, and would give as well\na guarantee that there is some constancy in the linguist’s use of the\nterm ‘S’ independent of his impression of such\nconstancy. Wittgenstein uses the example of the manometer in\n§§270–271 to consider this idea, and his criticism of\nit is in effect that this method of securing meaning works, but that\nthe secured meaning is public: the so-called “private\nobject”, even if there were such a thing, is revealed to be\nirrelevant to meaning. Presumably a defender of “private\nlanguage” would hope that the example would work like this: if I\nkeep saying, on the basis of my sensation, that my blood pressure is\nrising, and the manometer shows that I am right, then this success in\njudging my own blood pressure shows that I had in fact established a\nprivate meaning for the sign ‘S’ and was using\nthe sign in the same way each time to judge that my sensation was the\nsame each time. However, all the example really shows is that just\nthinking that I have the same sensation now as I had when my blood\npressure rose formerly, can be a good guide to the rising of my blood\npressure. Whether in some “private sense” the sensation\nwas “actually the same” or not becomes completely\nirrelevant to the question of constancy in the use of\n‘S’—that is, there is no gap between the\nactual nature of the sensation and my impression of it, and\n‘S’ in this case could mean merely\n‘sensation of the rising of the blood pressure’; indeed,\nfor all we are told of the sign’s role, it could even mean just\n‘blood pressure rising’. \nDoes the ruling out of memory-scepticism as irrelevant to the private\nlanguage argument mean that two associated Orthodox objections to it\nare likewise irrelevant? The first of these is that the argument,\nself-defeatingly, rules out a public language as well. The second\nrelies on the ‘community view’ interpretation: it is that\nthe argument, equally self-defeatingly, rules out as impossible\nsomething perfectly conceivable: namely, the case of a so-called\n‘Robinson Crusoe’, a human being who, unlike Defoe’s\noriginal Crusoe, is isolated from birth but devises a language for his\nown purposes without his having first been taught another language by\nsomeone else. Wittgenstein’s Orthodox defenders, faced with this\nsecond objection, looked to be on shaky ground, often being forced\ninto the position of conceding that the argument did indeed exclude\nthe case, but claiming (not very plausibly) that such a Crusoe is\nafter all impossible so that the concession was not damaging. \nThe question as it concerns the first objection has already been\nanswered. The supposed threat to public language arose entirely from\nthe claim that memory-scepticism could not be confined to the private\ncase. But since scepticism concerning memory is no part of the\nargument, there is no reason to suppose that any question of such\nconfinement arises, and thus there is no question of the argument’s\nbeing self-defeating by excluding the possibility of something we know\nto be actual, i.e., the language we already have. Now showing the\nabsence of any appeal to memory-scepticism involved transferring the\nburden of the argument from the question of whether or not an\nostensive definition could be remembered or not to the question of\nwhether there could be an ostensive definition in the first place. \nThis enables us to answer the question as it concerns the second\nobjection. It is clear that an argument which has as its focus the\nquestion of ostensive definition is not committed to ruling out in\nadvance all hypothetical cases of ‘Robinson Crusoes’. For\nthere is no a priori barrier to imagining a form of life\ncomplex enough for us to be assured that a determinate ostensive\ndefinition had been accomplished by such a being. Such a Crusoe,\nunlike a private linguist, lives in a world independent of his\nimpressions of it, and thus there could be definite occurrences in it\nwhich he could remember or forget; and some of those occurrences could\nbe correlations of signs with objects. It is easy to describe such\nhypothetical cases (a clear example appears in pages 486–8 of\nCanfield [1996]), and difficult to give a plausible denial that in\nsome sense they are possible. There are, however, further\ncomplications here, described briefly in section 4 below. \nThe Orthodox domination of the secondary literature on private\nlanguage was largely ended by Saul Kripke’s account of Wittgenstein’s\ntreatment of rules and private language, in which Wittgenstein appears\nas a sceptic concerning meaning. Kripke (p. 5) denies commitment to\nthe identity of this sceptical figure with its historical source, and,\nappropriately, his account has spawned a literature of its own in\nwhich discussion often proceeds largely independently of the original\nprivate language argument: Kripke’s Wittgenstein, real or fictional,\nhas become a philosopher in his own right, and for many people, it is\nnot an issue whether the historical Wittgenstein’s original ideas\nabout private language are faithfully captured in this version. The\ncomplexities of the subsequent discussion of the\nphilosophical—as opposed to interpretative—questions\nraised by Kripke’s Wittgenstein need a separate article to themselves.\n(For a survey, see Boghossian [1989].) All that will be settled here\nis the interpretative question. \nKripke’s account resembles that given here in its rejection of\nOrthodoxy and in its emphasis on the logical priority of\nWittgenstein’s discussion of rule-following to that of private\nlanguage. It differs in the prominence it gives to the opening\nsentence of Philosophical Investigations §201:\n‘This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined\nby a rule, because every course of action can be brought into accord\nwith the rule.’ Kripke says of this (p. 68), ‘The\nimpossibility of private language emerges as a corollary of\n[Wittgenstein’s] sceptical solution of his own paradox’.\nWittgenstein himself immediately brushed this “paradox”\naside in his very next paragraph: ‘That there is a\nmisunderstanding here …’; but Kripke takes the paradox to\npose a genuine and profound sceptical problem about meaning. \nThe example Kripke chooses to illustrate the problem is that of\naddition. What is it to grasp the rule of addition? The application of\nthe rule is potentially infinite, and bizarre interpretations of the\nrule, as well as the standard use of it, are compatible with any\nfinite set of applications of the usual sort such as 7 + 14 = 21. So\nwhat is it which makes it true that when I say ‘plus’ I\nmean the usual addition function and not some other? Kripke (pp.\n62–71) understands this question as containing a Humean problem\nto which, he claims, Wittgenstein gives a Humean,\n‘sceptical’ solution. \nWhat Kripke means by this comparison with a Humean problem is that\nWittgenstein is questioning the nexus between a past act of meaning\nand subsequent practice in a way analogous to that in which Hume\nquestions the causal nexus between a single past event and a\nsubsequent one. And what he means by a Humean solution is that there\nis a corresponding analogy between the ways in which Hume and\nWittgenstein handle their respective problems. Kripke’s view is that,\njust as Hume says, in effect, “Unique causation is\nunintelligible; A’s causing B consists in\nA’s being embedded in a pattern of the following of\nA-type-events by B-type-events which inclines us to\nassert that A caused B”, so, comparably,\nWittgenstein says, in effect, “Unique meaning is unintelligible;\nrather, someone’s meaning the usual addition function when saying\n‘plus’ consists in their being considered by a community\nto have passed the community’s test for employing that\nfunction.” \nKripke formulates the so-called Humean problem in two different\nways. \nThe first way is this: “[T]here is no fact about me that\ndistinguishes my meaning a definite function by ‘plus’\n… and my meaning nothing at all” (p. 21). The absence of\nthis fact, in Kripke’s view, leads Wittgenstein to abandon the\nexplanation of the meanings of statements like “By\n‘plus’, I meant addition” in terms of\ntruth-conditions, and to replace it with explanation in terms of\nassertibility-conditions, which involve actual (not merely potential)\ncommunity agreement. (Hence the claim that this is a ‘sceptical\nsolution’: Wittgenstein is supposed to concede to the sceptic\nthe absence of truth-conditions for such statements.) This agreement,\non Kripke’s account, legitimizes the assertion that I meant addition\nby ‘plus’ despite there having been no fact of the\nmatter. \nThis requirement of community agreement for meaning (the\n‘community view’) obviously rules out the possibility of\nprivate language immediately, thereby rendering the argument of\nPhilosophical Investigations §§256–271\nsuperfluous. This superfluity makes for an odd reading of the text;\nand the oddness is highlighted by the observation that this first\nformulation of the sceptical problem relies on Kripke’s assumption\nthat we have some idea of what a fact is, independent of a statement’s\nbeing true. For one of the themes of Philosophical\nInvestigations is that there is no such idea, that the only\nroute to the identification of facts is through the uses of the\nexpressions in which those facts are stated, uses which give us the\ntruth-conditions. These uses are often very different from what we\nwould expect—hence the impression that truth-conditions are\nlacking—and it is a matter of some philosophical difficulty to\nsee them clearly. \nThe other formulation of the problem is this (Kripke p. 62):\n“Wittgenstein questions the nexus between past\n‘intention’ or ‘meanings’ and present\npractice: for example, between my past ‘intentions’ with\nregard to ‘plus’ and my present computation …\n.” The idea is that my grasp of the rule governing the use of\n‘plus’ does not determine that I shall produce a unique\nanswer for each of indefinitely many new additions in the future. The\nimpression that something is missing here, though, is a result of just\nthat kind of confusion about determination identified in the section\nheaded ‘The Significance of the Issue’ above. \nKripke’s account of the private language argument is thus vitiated by\nhis unargued reliance on ideas which Wittgenstein argued against. This\nof course does not show that he has not hit upon a new and more\ninteresting notion of private language than that expounded here.\nFurther, his reading of the argument gave new life to the debate over\nthe community view. \nAlthough, as was just said, the community view is not easily\nreconciled with part of Wittgenstein’s text, the matter is less clear\nthan has been indicated so far. Significantly, even the most careful,\ninsightful and sympathetic of Wittgenstein’s commentators have divided\non this matter (for example, Malcolm for the community view, and Baker\nand Hacker against it). The dispute is partly explained by the fact\nthat the original texts (including some from Wittgenstein’s\nmanuscripts) seem to point two ways, some supporting the account given\nabove (that the burden of the argument is that language must be\npotentially social), others the community view that language is\nessentially social. \nThat is, textual support can be found for two apparently conflicting\nexegetical claims: \nAnd the contending parties share the assumption that the conflict is\ngenuine. \nThere is, however, reason to believe that this assumption is false,\nfor investigation of Wittgenstein’s notions of essential,\npossible and lifelong Crusoe shows that admission of\nthe first claim does not commit him to the denial of the second. To\ntake the first notion: on Wittgenstein’s view, while chess is\nessentially a game for two players, this does not exclude the\npossibility of playing it against oneself provided such solitary games\nare not regarded as paradigm instances of chess. Similarly, he can\nclaim that language is essentially social, but still allow the\npossibility of exceptions provided these are peripheral cases. The\nissue is complex, and its pursuit would lead away from the current\narticle’s purpose of articulating the central text. For a detailed\naccount, the reader is referred to Canfield [1996] (to which this\nsection is indebted, and which also contains a useful bibliography of\nthe debate over the community view), and to Hacker [2010].","contact.mail":"gwrisley3@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
