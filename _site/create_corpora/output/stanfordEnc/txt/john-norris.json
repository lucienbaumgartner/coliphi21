Norris wrote on\nnumerous topics, including politics, religion, philosophy and the\nChristian life. He also composed poetry. This entry describes several\nof Norris' most noteworthy advances and insights.\n\n\n\nOne important goal of his philosophical writing was the completion of\nMalebranche's project. Norris believed Malebranche did not prove the\nexistence of the intelligible world, viz. the mind of God.  Nor did\nMalebranche offer a full account of the nature of the intelligible\nworld. Norris adopted Descartes' view of the structure of thought, and\na Malebranchean view of the contents of thought. He also elaborated a\nversion of Descartes' real distinction proof in order to weaken\nLocke's thinking matter hypothesis. Proving the existence and\nimmortality of the soul was a prime concern for Norris. Moreover, he\nwas troubled by the heterodox theological views of the Enthusiasts\n(Quakers) and Socinians. He constructed numerous arguments against\ntheir doctrines by utilizing the “divine light,”\ncharacterized within what he called his “Ideal\nPhilosophy.”\n\n\n\nJohn Norris was born on January 2, 1657 in Collingbourne Kingston,\nWiltshire. His father was a minister, and Norris was the second of\nfour siblings. His early training was a Puritan one. In 1671, he began\na course of study at Winchester School, where he received a classical\neducation; the curriculum included Greek and Latin literature, and the\nyoung Norris excelled at his studies. He matriculated at Exeter\nCollege, at Oxford, spending the years from 1676 – 1680 studying\nthe Scholastic and ancient authors. In 1680, Norris was elected a\nFellow of All Souls College, a distinction he enjoyed for nine years\nand would always recall fondly. He was ordained in 1684 and sometime\nbefore 1688 he also discovered the works of Malebranche, who would\nbecome one of his philosophical heroes. \n\nIt was during his stay at All Souls that Norris published several of\nhis most popular works. He published the first edition of A\nCollection of Miscellanies in 1687, which would culminate in a\nninth edition printed in 1730. At this time he also published\n“The Root of Liberty,” a sermon in which he defended human\nfreedom by an appeal to the Augustinian concept of attention. In these\npublications, Norris' own thought is pronounced; they exhibit an\nindependence from the heavy influence Malebranchean doctrine would\nexert upon Norris' subsequent works. The Theory and Regulation of\nLove, a piece characterizing love as the summons of God, was\npublished in 1688, and the first text in which Norris clearly adopted\nMalebranchean arguments. Norris appended to this text his\ncorrespondence with Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist. Finally in\n1689, he published Reason and Religion, which would be\nreissued seven times until 1724. \n\nHe resigned the fellowship in 1689, married, and began a two-year\noccupation as rector at Newton St. Loe in Somersetshire. There, he\npublished one of his most popular texts, Christian\nBlessedness, in 1690. One year later, Locke appealed to the Earl\nof Pembroke on Norris' behalf; consequently, Norris assumed the duties\nof rector at Bemerton near Salisbury. In general, he preferred study\nand meditation, and found his duties as rector to impinge upon his\nscholarly activities. Nonetheless, he maintained various\ncorrespondences. He engaged in correspondences with Elizabeth Thomas\n(“Corinna”), Damaris Cudworth (Lady Masham), Mary Astell\nand Locke, among others. In 1695, Norris published his correspondence\nwith Astell and entitled it, Letters concerning the Love of God,\nbetween the Author of the Proposal to the Ladies and Mr. John\nNorris. Moreover, he found the time to publish pamphlets and\ntreatises on a variety of topics including the Toleration Act,\nChristian morality, the immortality of the soul, and the difference\nbetween the Ideal Philosophy he endorsed and the enthusiasm of the\nQuakers. Norris made clear these differences in an addendum to\nReflections upon the Conduct of Human Life in 1691. Richard\nVickris, the Quaker, replied irately to this addendum. This generated\na heated reply from Norris, in which he further elucidated the\ndifferences between the “divine light” of his own\nphilosophy and that of the Quaker doctrines. This work was entitled\nTwo Treatises concerning the Divine Light and was issued in\n1692. Locke and Norris shared the objective of debunking the Quakers'\nclaim to direct enlightenment from God. But their differences far\noutweighed their similarities. \n\nIn 1690, Norris issued criticisms of Locke's An Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding¸ the first edition of which was\npublished in December 1689. Norris' review, entitled Cursory\nReflections upon a Book called An Essay concerning Human\nUnderstanding, prompted Locke to modify the second edition of the\nEssay at 2.10.2. Otherwise, Locke did not reply publicly to\nNorris' criticisms. It was only after Locke and Norris quarreled that\nLocke published his estimation of Norris' works. Lady Masham had\nentrusted a letter for Locke to Norris, but news reached Locke that\nNorris had opened the letter. Locke suspected Norris in spite of his\nprotests, and from that time forward, which was the end of 1692, they\nwere not on friendly terms (Cranston 1957, 364–365). Shortly thereafter\n(1693), Locke wrote Remarks upon some of Mr. Norris' Books,\nWherein he asserts P. Malebranche's Opinion of seeing all Things in\nGod and  Examination of Malebranche. Charlotte Johnston has\nargued that the impetus and target for Locke's critical evaluation of\nMalebranche's thought was Norris, whom he viewed as reiterating\nMalebranche's thought (1958). In the Cursory Reflections,\nNorris stated that he would soon publish a treatise, in which he would\npresent his own philosophy at length. \n\nBut it was not until 1701 that Norris completed the first volume of\nhis magnum opus, An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or\nIntelligible World. The second volume was issued in\n1704. (Hereafter, Theory I and Theory II,\nrespectively.)  Norris examines the divine nature in Theory I\nand in Theory II he details the nature of creation,\nspecifically the nature of humanity and animals. These highly\ntheoretical works did not enjoy the popular success of his other\nwritings. One of these, An Account of Reason and Faith, in\nRelation to the Mysteries of Christianity, was so well-read that\nit was issued in a fourteenth edition as late as 1790. His last two\ntheoretical works concerned the nature of the soul: A\nPhilosophical Discourse concerning the Natural Immortality of the\nSoul, published in 1708, and A Letter to Mr. Dodwell\nconcerning the Immortality of the Soul of Man, issued in 1709. It\nwould seem that his many duties as rector did not hinder him\ncompletely from engaging in his beloved intellectual pursuits, as his\npublication record demonstrates. His final publication within his own\nlifetime, A Treatise concerning Christian Prudence, was\nprinted just a year before his death. He died in February of 1711,\naged fifty-six years, at Bemerton, and was interred there. \n\nIt is puzzling that a figure as popular and widely-read as Norris has\nreceived such little recognition from intellectual historians of the\nearly modern period. Perhaps Norris has not been paid much attention\nbecause his philosophical writings appear to contain an eclectic\nmixture of many divergent, incompatible sources rather than a coherent\nsynthesis of those sources. Charles McCracken notes that Norris has\nbeen dubbed in a variety of ways, but that the “English\nMalebranche” seems most appropriate (179). Norris was heavily\ninfluenced by Malebranche, and goes so far as advising his own\nchildren that Malebranche's Search after Truth should\n“always be read, studied, dwelt and fed upon till it be\ndigested, made your own, and converted as it were into the very\nSubstance of your Souls” (Spiritual Counsel\n501). Norris was also a follower of Descartes, whom Norris viewed as\nconstructing “the only intelligible Frame of Natural Science\nthat has yet appear'd in the World, and the only intire System that\ndeserves the name of Philosophy” (500). Norris also\ndraws liberally from his Scholastic background, and frequently uses\ntheoretical tools borrowed from the canonical thinkers taught at the\nuniversities, such as Aquinas, Augustine and Suarez. His heavy\nreliance on diverse intellectual sources, especially Descartes and\nMalebranche, is apparent in his writings. Nonetheless, his arguments\nare tremendously valuable for understanding better the debates of his\ntime.  His rehearsal of Descartes' real distinction proof and his\nevaluation of Locke's thinking matter hypothesis exposes some critical\nLockean assumptions, bringing into sharp relief the disagreements\nbetween the rationalists and empiricists of that era. He also\ninfluenced the views of other minor figures, most notably, Mary Astell\nand Arthur Collier. Finally, Norris' adaptation and expansion\nof Malebranche's twin doctrines of Vision in God and occasionalism are\nalso central to understanding the continuation of the Cartesian\nproject in late 17th and early 18th century\nEngland. \n\nThe intelligible world is the realm of Platonic objects that\nconstitutes the source and grounds of human knowledge.  Malebranche's\naccount of the intelligible world is incomplete according to\nNorris: \n\nNorris considers his Theories I and II to be the\ncompletion of Malebranche's project. In Theory I, Norris\ndiscusses the nature of God, and in Theory II he discusses\nhow creation is related to God. The most substantial expansion upon\nMalebranche's thought occurs in the first part of this treatise, where\nNorris spends a great deal of time arguing that God is truth. The\nintelligible world is the mind of God, a “kind of Terra\nIncognita, a more Intellectual America” (3). \n\nNorris first argues for the existence of an ideal counterpart to\nnature. Since the world is created, “it must of necessity\nreceive its Being from some other Being that was when it self was\nnot” (18). He considers the nature of a being that is capable of\nbringing existence from absolute privation, and concludes such a being\nmust be infinitely powerful. Relying upon the premise that all action\nis guided by thought, and that God could not have thought about the\nworld because it did not exist at the time, Norris concludes the ideas\nthat guided God's thought in the creation of the world and its\ninhabitants must be “their essential Reasons and Natures before\nthey had any in this, nay even from all Eternity…and that there\nis an Intelligible as well as a Sensible World,\ntruly representative and exhibitive of this,” or “ a fair\nintelligible Mirrour” (26). The intelligible world is the\npattern or model of nature, “since it could no more be its own\nExemplary or Formal, than Efficient\nCause” (30). \n\nHis second argument for the intelligible world is from the existence\nof natural kinds. Norris asks “Why is not the Body of one Man as\nbig as the Globe of the Sun, while that of another is too small to be\nseen without a Microscope?” and answers “'tis not\naccording to the Idea of that Creature that he should be\neither so big, or so little” (39). This stance marks a\nnoteworthy departure from Malebranche, who claims God does not have\nparticular ideas of bodies in Elucidation 10 of the\nSearch. Norris' next argument begins with our understanding\nof perfect, geometrical objects. Norris says when he views “a\nglobular Body I have naturally excited in me an Idea of a\nperfect Globe or Sphere” (51). This implies the existence of an\nideal sphere because “the effect cannot have more perfection\nthan its Cause…because the Cause cannot give that to the effect\nwhich it has not it self” (52). Norris concludes that human\nthought of perfect circles proves an ideal circle exists as the cause\nof thought because there are none in nature. \n\nHis fourth argument comes from the nature of truth. Norris considers\nthe skeptic's claim that there is no absolute truth and turns the\ntable on the skeptic. If the skeptic is right, then there is no truth,\nwhich is itself an absolute truth. As such, the claim, ‘There is\nno truth’, would be a necessary and eternal truth: \n\nThere are eternal truths, as even the skeptic must admit, so there are\nalso eternal relations of ideas because truth relates ideas. In\nNorris' view, it is the divine ideas that are related. Truth is\ngrounded “upon this necessity of Union and Connexion of Ideas in\ncertain Propositions” (67). Norris adapts Suarez' view that all\nrelations are accidental, hence require a subject. Nonetheless, Norris\nargues that the eternal truths “are Real, and have an\nexistence out of, and independent upon the understanding”\n(70). The eternal truths derive their reality from the “Simple\nEssences of things” and these are the eternal divine ideas,\nwhich stand in Suarezian accidental relations to one another\n(71). Norris' fifth argument for the existence of divine ideas is that\nthere are objective sciences concerning universals, such as\nmetaphysics and geometry. These disciplines concern necessary\nknowledge, “to speak more conformably to the School-language, in\na knowledge acquired by Demonstration” (128–129). Since\nall science concerns the necessary and unchanging, science cannot be\nabout contingent things, but about universals. These universals are\nthe intelligible objects, or the divine ideas. \n\nNorris' final and sixth argument for the existence of the intelligible\nworld derives from the existence of God. Indeed, Norris views his own\nwork as the culmination of the project begun by Plato. A proper\nreading of the Timaeus will reveal Plato meant “the\nExemplaria rerum in mente Divina to be the Original Forms or\nPatterns of things in the divine Understanding” rather than the\nstandard interpretation, which is that the creator consult and not be\nthe locus of abstract objects (139). If God has the ideas, then the\nintelligible world exists because God exists. God has the ideas in an\neminent manner (‘eminent’ is discussed further below), and\nthese ideas are the objects of His thought. Relying upon the principle\nthat all knowledge is knowledge of something, Norris concludes that\nthe divine ideas are real objects in the mind of God. These ideas are\n“really Coessential with and indistinct from the Essence of\nGod” (155) so when God considers ideas, God considers\nhimself. God considers himself adequately and inadequately, \n\nHe concludes his arguments for the existence of the intelligible world\nby stating that the ideal world is better known than the natural world\nbecause it is necessary, eternal and immutable. As Descartes had\nargued, the senses are part of the natural world and are designed to\nassist in preserving the union of soul and body, or to keep one alive,\nnot for delivering knowledge. The nature and existence of the\nintelligible world is discovered by intellectual activity; the highest\ndegree of intellectual activity is the clear and distinct\nperception. \n\nWhen one clearly and distinctly cognizes the nature of God, one\nperceives God as simple, immaterial and infinite. In traditional\nChristian doctrine, these attributes are of paramount importance. Any\nphilosophical theory compromising them must be rejected. Norris\nexplains: \n\nSome critics, including Arnauld, had charged Malebranche with\nSpinozism because he claimed God has the idea of intelligible\nextension. Such critics reasoned that the only way for God to contain\nextension is for God to be extended. Norris reconciles God's\npossession of intelligible extension with the immateriality of God by\nusing the notion of eminent containment. There are two ways a thing\ncan be contained in another, formally or eminently. Norris notes\nformal and eminent containment are usually discussed in the context of\ncausation. Generally, formal containment explains cause and effect\nsequences amongst similar causes and effects. For example, the cause\nof a child's fear might be the recollection of a frightening\nimage. The child's fear is formally contained in the\nrecollection. Eminent containment explains dissimilar causes and\neffects. When an architect designs a building, and several months\nlater the architect's vision is realized in a physical structure, that\nphysical structure was eminently contained, or contained in a higher\nmanner, in the mind of the architect. All human actions, as long as\nthey are planned, are eminently contained in the human\nmind. Analogously, Norris states God eminently contains extension as a\ndivine idea just as the architect eminently contains the\nbuilding. Intelligible extension, then, is a divine idea. Norris\nbelieves that the ideal philosophy can settle the meaning of\n‘eminent containment’, and thus settle the dispute about\nintelligible extension. This view is found in “POSTSCRIPT,\nConcerning the Distinction of Formaliter and Eminenter,\nas applied to the manner of the Perfection of Things being in\nGod,” appended to Theory I. \n\nNorris derives the “divine ideality,” or the divine ideas,\nfrom the infinitude of God, and he derives God's infinity from the\ndivine ideas (Norris argues this is non-circular as we shall see\nbelow): \n\nOne objection Norris raises concerns how the infinite can represent\nthe finite. His answer again relies upon the thought of Suarez, whom\nNorris reread carefully before writing his Theories I and\nII. Suarez had distinguished two ways of being finite. An\nitem can be finite according to its “esse\nformale” or its “esse reale” (300). If\na thing is positively finite, it is limited in such a way that can\nnever be infinite. If a thing is negatively finite, it is finite\n“though there be no repugnance in its having it [infinitude]\nfrom elsewhere” (301–302, brackets added). A divine idea,\naccording to its esse formale is negatively finite whereas\naccording to its esse reale is infinite. Norris believes\n“Ideas are really Identical with the Divine Nature, and so\npartake of the same real Infinity and Incomprehensibility that\nessentially belongs to it” (302). If each idea is identical to\nGod, then each idea is really infinite, and negatively finite. A\nfurther consequence is that an idea can be called both infinite and\nfinite without contradiction. Norris also notes there is no\nmultiplication of infinities in God on his view. Here Norris diverges\nfrom Malebranche's view as stated in the second dialogue of\nDialogues on Metaphysics and Religion that God is\n“infinitely infinite,” which strikes the reader as\ncomparable to Spinoza's infinite attributes. \n\nOne might wonder how God's ideality could be proven from his infinity\nand his infinity from his ideality because such an argument appears\ncircular. Norris explains why this need not concern us: \n\nIndeed, Norris proves the existence of God from the nature of truth,\nwhich is another divine attribute. (See A Metaphysical\nEssay 193–207 in Miscellanies.) Norris also proves the\nmany attributes of God beginning with God's attribute of necessary\nexistence, revealed in His proclamation to Moses that He is “I\nAm.” In Reason and Religion Norris interprets this\nproclamation as Being. These various demonstrations proceed by proving\n“the same by the same” since any and all attributes are\n“really the same” with one another, the attributes are\nidentical to God. \n\nThese arguments preserve the divine attribute of simplicity. If God is\nsimple, then proofs utilizing different attributes must be proofs that\nutilize the same subject. The diversity of the attributes are\nexplained as various ways of cognizing the same divine essence: \n\nNorris proceeds to explain how an attribute such as omnipotence can be\naccounted for because it is “displayed according to the\ndiversity of objects” and “Modes of operation”\n(34). In the mode of creating, God is the omnipotent Creator. The\nrelevant object here is all of creation. In the mode of legislator,\nGod is the Supreme Lawgiver, and the relevant object is the moral\nrealm. The diverse ways of considering the natural world are also the\nmany ways we can conceive of God's attributes. In the end, humanity\nhas partial, imperfect views of God according to his operations. A\nlesser being, such as a human, can also be known under many\noperations. One might be a parent, spouse, writer and teacher. But\nthat person is defined in those roles because of the objects that\nthese titles refer to; in the case of the teacher, the person is a\nteacher only with respect to the students taught. One is a parent only\nwith respect to the role played towards offspring, but the person is\n“really one and the same.” Just as we might come to know\nan individual better and better as we come to know more of the\nperson's roles, so we come to know God better by conceiving of his\nmany attributes. Norris believes that all attributes are one in God,\ndifferently conceived according to the roles played and objects\nconsidered. \n\nFurthermore, Norris reduces the eternal truths, which are the\naccidental relations amongst the divine ideas to the ideas themselves,\nand then reduces the ideas to God: \n\nSo it is odd that, after laying out these arguments for the simplicity\nof God, Norris states that the flaw in Descartes' account of\nvoluntarism is that Descartes had attributed to the divine will what\nbelongs to another attribute of God – the divine ideality. If\nthe attributes are all one, it is difficult to argue for a priority\namongst attributes. Nonetheless, Norris argues that Descartes was\ncorrect to claim truth must depend on God alone, but incorrectly\nbelieved God arbitrarily creates the eternal truth, for this renders\ntruth as mutable as any other creature. What Descartes missed,\naccording to Norris, was the distinction between God as\nintelligible, or exhibitive, and God as intelligent,\nor conceptive (Miscellanies 440, Theory I 357–358).\nTo understand God as conceptive is to understand God as a thinker, who\nreflects upon his own ideas. To understand God as exhibitive is to\nunderstand God qua divine ideas. The complexity arising from\nincluding ideas in the divine mind is a further difficulty for divine\nsimplicity. In the end, if Norris is to be read as consistent, he must\nclaim that the divine ideality is another attribute of God. Norris\nmight have taken Malebranche's lead, who wrote, concerning divine\nsimplicity, “I long stopped worrying about problems that are\nbeyond me” (qtd. in Schmaltz 2000 62). But it is noteworthy that\nNorris did not; concerning the topic of divine simplicity, Norris\nadvances the work of his predecessors, in particular the work of\nMalebranche. In a passage reminiscent of Thomistic analogical\npredication, Norris suggests that God as intelligent, or as\nengaging in thought, must be radically different from our experiences\nof cogitation: \n\nThe extent of humanity's knowledge of the essence of God is a problem\nthat has preoccupied many thinkers in the history of Western\nphilosophy. Unlike other areas of inquiry, questions concerning the\nnature of God, even if they are unanswerable now, receive answers in\nthe next life. Although Norris believes that we can answer many\nimportant questions about the divine essence, our view of the\nintelligible world is dim indeed. He concedes that certain mysteries\nare temporarily beyond our ken. Norris would agree with what Descartes\nwrote in his First Replies: \n\nHumanity does have some reliable knowledge about some subject-matter,\nand Norris offers an account of this partial enlightenment. Norris\nbelieves, for example, that we know enough to clearly and distinctly:\n1. Accept Descartes' real distinction proof and 2. Refute Locke's\nthinking matter hypothesis. \n\nQuestions about the form and content of human thought occupied the\nphilosophers of the early modern period. One helpful way to draw the\nline between the empiricists and the rationalists of this time period\nis along issues concerning human cognition. Norris believes the object\nof thought is always God and the structure of thought facilitates\nobjective, indubitable knowledge. For these reasons, he belongs squarely\nin the rationalist camp. \n\nNorris espouses a Cartesian theory of human thought, which he\ndelineates in Theory II and Reason and Religion.\nNorris says that all thought exhibits a certain structure –\nformal thought, which is the act of thinking, and objective thought,\nwhich is the object of the thinking. Like Descartes, Norris claims all\nthought is about some thing. Formal thought is always the same,\nwhether we are perceiving or “willing, desiring, loving, hating,\nhoping, fearing…even sensation it self”\n(Theory II 109). Thoughts differ based upon content. Like\nMalebranche and unlike Descartes, the object of thought is always God,\nand “'tis the diversity of this Ideal Object that makes all the\ndiversity and distinction that is to be found in our Thought, whether\nNatural or Moral” (113). God's omniform essence is always the\ncontent of perception, intellection and passion. Indeed, all knowledge\nis always of God qua divine ideas. When perceiving the ideas,\nwe are viewing “the very same Divine Nature it self, as\n‘tis variously imitable or Participable ad extra,\naccording to such or such intelligible Degrees of Being or\nPerfection” (Theory I 294). Hence, the sole object of\nour perceptions, both intellectual and sensory, is God. When humans\nthink, we think and conduct proofs in mental propositions, but “\nto Speak exactly ‘tis not the mental Proposition that it [our\nthought] demonstrates, but ‘tis the mental Proposition\nthat demonstrates the real. The former belonging to the Act, as the\nlatter does to the Object of Science” (311,\nbrackets added). Our thoughts are always about the ideal propositions,\nconstituted by the divine ideas as they are related to one\nanother. \n\nWhen we think in propositions, we usually think directly; direct\nthinking is everyday cognition such as knowing to proceed at green\nlights or knowing dentists' chairs are frightening. All humanity\nthinks directly, or in these ordinary ways, but some persons engage in\nreflexive thought, or about the mind itself and its contents. In\nreflexive thought, there is a return of the mind onto itself, or an\nattending to the contents of the mind; such reflexive thoughts are\nmore attentive perceptions of the divine ideas, and these thoughts are\ncontemplations of the eternal truths. Norris states along with Locke\n(Essay 4.3.2) that knowledge is perceiving “those\nRelations of agreement or disagreement that are between Ideas, which\nwhoever clearly and rightly perceives, is truly said to\nknow” (Theory II 147–148). Knowledge of the\neternal truths, of course, is the highest grade of knowledge, or\nscientia. By engaging in reflexive thought, we can align our\nmental propositions with the ideal ones. The ultimate intellectual\ngoal is this alignment of our thought with the eternal truths. \n\nNorris adopts the Malebranchean doctrine of Vision in God, which\nstates that all intellectual and sensory perception is perception of\nGod. Norris significantly augments neither Malebranche's account nor\nargument for Vision in God with respect to sensory perception.  Norris\nlimits himself to reproducing Malebranche's eliminative argument from\nthe Search after Truth for why our sensory perception must be\nof ideas in God. The eliminative argument is found in chapters VII\nthrough XI in Theory II. Yet Norris does offer a more\ndetailed account of abstract thought (which is an intellectual\nperception of God) than does Malebranche. Norris meticulously conveys\nhow we come to have knowledge of the essences of created things. God\nis revealed through degrees of being (i.e. divine ideas), such as the\ndegrees of being exhibited by bodies and minds, and we can come to\nknow their essences by attending carefully to our perceptions of\ndivine ideas. Careful attention requires thinking abstractly for\nNorris, and Norris offers us a definition of abstraction: \n\nAbstraction serves to make the intellect's “View of things more\nclear and distinct. As Spectacles, tho' in him that uses them they\nargue weakness of Sight, yet when used they do very much assist the\nAct of Vision” (176–177).  Abstraction is the\nkey to understanding how we come to know about minds and bodies. When\nconsidering the ideas of body, we understand that \n\nThis sort of abstraction Norris calls “modal abstraction.”\nSince we cannot imagine a body without some shape and some dimensions,\nshape and dimensions are determinables, or modes, of extension. Shape\nis not an independently existing thing, but is always a modification\nof an independently existing thing. Since Norris holds that our clear\nand distinct mental propositions track ideal propositions, we can\nconclude that shape and dimensions are not substances, but\nmodes. Modal abstraction turns out to underscore Norris' rehearsal of\nreal distinction. His account is noteworthy because it offers an\nalternative understanding of the real distinction proof. When we are\ncertain that the two items under consideration are not distinct by\nmodal abstraction, we can be sure the two items are really\ndistinct. \n\nAnother question preoccupying the early moderns concerned the\nconstitution of the human being. Is the human being a union of an\nimmortal soul and a mortal body? Or is the human being a mere body\nwith mentality somehow added? Descartes, in connection with the\nversion of the real distinction proof in the Sixth\nMeditation, argues that we can know clearly and distinctly that a\nhuman being is a union of two really distinct substances, a soul and a\nbody. Locke, at 4.3.6 of the Essay, states we might be bodies\nwith thought superadded. Norris perceives Locke's hypothesis as\ncontradicting Cartesian real distinction, so he reestablishes real\ndistinction in his Theory II. His reconstruction of\nDescartes' proof begins with the realization that the distinction\nbetween the mind and body is not at all like the distinction between\nthe body and shape: \n\nThe fact that we can clearly and distinctly conceive of the body\nexisting without the mind and vice versa entails that the body is\nreally distinct from the mind. Ontological relationships are reflected\nin human thought when we are thinking clearly and distinctly, and if a\nmodal abstraction is present, we can be certain that the items under\nconsideration are the modes of a substance. On the other hand, when\none thing can be thought while considering the other as not existing,\nthe things are not modes after all, but really distinct substances.\nOtherwise, there is no criterion of intelligibility, and for Norris\n“all Truth is intelligible” (30). If we\ndo not accept the standard of clarity and distinctness, no standard\nfor human judgment remains. \n\nIn Cursory Reflections, Norris presses Locke about the nature\nof an idea. Locke's account of ideas as originating in sensation and\nreflection found at 2.1 of the  Essay is met by Norris with:\n“These indeed are pretty Smiling Sentences. But before\nwe go a step further I would willingly know of the Author what kind of\nthings these Ideas are which are thus let in at the Gate of the\nSenses” (22). Norris infers that Lockean ideas must be either\nmental substances or modifications, and then presents difficulties for\neither option. For Norris, the foundation of intelligibility can never\nhave an empirical basis. The foundation must be the true nature of\nideas: \n\nIn addition to the defense of real distinction, Norris questions\nLocke's suggestion that we might be thinking matter. Norris, along\nwith many of his contemporaries, questions the mechanisms by which\nmatter could be endowed with thought. Mary Astell, with whom Norris\ncorresponded, is as confounded when she wonders whether God “may\naccording to the good Pleasure of His Omnipotency, give it [a\ntriangle] a good speaking, a walking, or a\ndancing Faculty, and make it able to Eat and Drink”\n(Christian Religion 254–255, brackets added). Astell's\nassumption here is shared by Norris; things are what they are\naccording to their essences, which are determined by God's\nideas. Extended bodies cannot reveal mental states through walking and\ndancing, only minds are capable of initiating such acts. Norris\nutilizes this assumption in one of his arguments against the thinking\nmatter hypothesis: \n\nSince bodies are sometimes separately produced from minds, God does\nnot create them from the same idea. Body and mind are created from\ndifferent ideas; they have separate essences. \n\nWhereas Locke argues that the human being might, for all we know, be\nmatter with thought superadded, Norris claims in no uncertain terms\nthat the human being is a substantial union. However, Norris can only\nargue for his claim within his ideal philosophy, which Locke rejects.\nBut the grounds for rejection spring from the very view of\n‘idea’ Locke espouses; an idea is generated and formed by\nsensation and reflection. This debate concerns, fundamentally, the\nontological status of ideas, and how far ideas can guarantee a\ncorrespondence to reality external to thought. In this debate, the\nreader can fully appreciate one main difference between Cartesian\nrationalism and Lockean empiricism in late 17th Century\nEngland. For Locke, propositions about ideas are themselves mere\nmental propositions. As such, their certainty does not guarantee\ntruth. For Norris, clear and distinct mental propositions reflect\nideal propositions. Certainty about mental propositions does guarantee\ntruth. \n\nNorris offers an important insight into how the real distinction proof\ndepends on abstractive processes. However, like Malebranche, Norris\nclaims that we have no access to God's idea of the mind.  The mind's\nexistence is known only by inner consciousness, or sentiment. This\nraises the same problems for Norris that Malebranche has defending the\nproof. (See Nolan and Whipple 2005.) If humanity is ignorant about the\nessence of the soul, then there can be no proof using the essence of\nthe soul as a premise; we cannot know if the proposition, ‘The\nmind is a substance’, is true or false.  At best, it is\nindeterminate. So, whether Norris can fully defend the proof is\nquestionable. Nonetheless, Norris argues for the immortality of the\nsoul in A Philosophical Discourse concerning the Natural\nImmortality of the Soul in response to a work published by Henry\nDodwell. Dodwell held that all souls are material, and only a few\nsouls are granted immortality. Norris, relying upon the essence of the\nsoul as immaterial, draws a distinction between the indissolvible and\nthe imperishable (33–34). The soul is naturally indissolvible because\nit is indivisible, but it is not imperishable. If God ceased his\nconstant creation, all things would immediately cease to exist. \n\nNorris dedicates a chapter in Theory II to the topic of\nanimals. Descartes and Malebranche had held that animals are mere\nmachines. Norris agrees there are good reasons to believe that animals\nare machines, but it is possible that they have souls because\n“'tis easy to err in the Dark.” Norris discourages\n“any practices of Cruelty, upon the Bodies of these Creatures,\nwhich the Lord of Creation has…subjected to our Power.”\nHe advises us to treat animals “with as much tenderness and\npitiful regard, as if they had all that Sense and Perception, which is\ncommonly…attributed to them” (100). \n\nA recurring theme in Norris' writings is the importance of solitude and\nmeditation. Christianity, for Norris, was a highly personal\nrelationship with one's God. Being a good Christian involves the\nopening of one's mind to a comprehension of God. “For Passion is\nthe great Contrariety to Reason, and will draw a cloud over the\nbrightest Mind. The quiet and sedate Soul is most fit for the\nContemplation of Truth, as the calmest Weather is commonly the most\nserene” (Two Treatises in Treatises upon Several\nSubjects 353). \n\nOne truth the meditative Christian comes to understand is that God is\nlove. Norris believes love is a natural tendency of the soul, and\nanalogizes love to motion in The Theory and Regulation of\nLove. There he writes: “So that upon the whole to speak\nmore explicitly the most general and Comprehensive Notion of\nLove will be found to be, a motion of the Soul towards\nGod” (12). Regarding the objects of love, one can love the\ngeneral, universal good, viz. God, or particular goods, which reflect\nthe goodness of God, “For God having unfolded his Perfections in\nthe Creation with almost infinite Variety, and as it were drawn out\nhimself into a numerous issue of Secondary goods, our Love\nbecomes also Multiplied” (12). Regarding the act of love, one\ncan love with benevolence or with desire. Concupiscence, or loving\nwith desire, is a general tendency towards good. Benevolent love is\nwilling a specific good for a person. Benevolent love is further\ndivided into self-love and other-love, which Norris also calls the\n“love of charity.” All concupiscence proceeds from\nindigence so it is rooted in self-love, whereas love of charity does\nnot have to proceed from self-love. He explains why God is a\nnarcissistic God: “For as GOD is to himself his own good, his\nown Center and Beatifick Object, so the Love of GOD can be no other\nthan Love of himself” (Letters 226). Since God wants\nnothing, God cannot exhibit concupiscence, but only love of charity\nfor humanity. The correct object of our love is also God, especially\ngiven the occasionalism thesis that God is the genuine cause of all\nthe secondary goods we might desire. It is only in God that one finds\nfull satisfaction of desire, “he is also the true final Cause of\nthe Will of Man; which I take to be nothing else but that continual\nImpression whereby the Author of Nature moves him towards\nhimself” (227). It is important to keep in mind that God is\ninfinite love; echoing again the Thomistic theme running throughout\nNorris' works, it is impossible to understand exactly how God\nloves. \n\nContrary to this Thomistic theme, the Socinians believed all Christian\ndoctrine should be comprehensible. Socinianism was advanced in John\nToland's 1696 Christianity not Mysterious.  Socinianism\nrejected inexplicable Christian doctrine, such as the divinity of\nChrist as man. Norris believed Socinianism to be a dangerous view\nbecause it leads to either deism or atheism. This threatening\nentailment led him to respond to the doctrine in An Account of\nReason and Faith, which he published in 1697. In the piece,\nNorris defines some truths as above reason, such as the existence of\nthe Trinity. Other claims are blatantly “Contrary to Reason when\nwe do positively comprehend that it cannot be” (117); these\nclaims should be rejected. However, there are many claims we should\nnot reject so quickly: \n\nNeither option presents itself as true, but Norris proceeds to ask the\nSocinian if he would accept it as an article of faith if God were to\nreveal the correct option. Human ignorance does not entail falsity.\nMoreover, human ignorance does not entail divine ignorance just as a\nneophyte mathematician's inability to demonstrate “the\nDiameter of a Square is incommensurable to the Side” does\nnot entail the lack of a demonstration (321). Norris concludes that\nthe Socinians improperly hold the human intellect to be the standard\nfor truth. Truth is understood and determined by God, who possesses an\ninfinite intellect. The fact that the Trinity is incomprehensible does\nnot warrant its rejection: \n\nReason is reliable, but limited. The Socinians have gone too far in\ntheir support of reason. On the other hand, Norris believes that the\nQuakers have gone too far in the other direction. \n\nNorris was familiar with Roger Barclay and George Keith's expositions\nof Quakerism, and argued against the view in Reflections upon the\nConduct of Human Life. The Quakers had an affinity for the ideal\nphilosophy because they believed the divine light that enlightens the\nhuman mind supported their view. Norris delineates the many\ndifferences between Quaker thought and his own, but perhaps the main\ndifference is: “The Quakers represent this light within as a\nsort of Extraordinary Inspiration (whence they have the name\nof Enthusiasts) whereas I suppose it to be a Man's\nNatural and Ordinary way of Understanding”\n(Two Treatises 365). Also, Norris identifies their\ninspiration as limited to moral and spiritual truths. Norris also\nconcludes that the Quakers render the divine light a creature because\nit cannot be God on the Quakers' view. God and creatures are the only\ntwo possibilities for existing things, hence, the divine light of the\nQuakers is a creature. Also, the divine light must be considered\nmaterial since it is described as a “Vehiculum\nDei” and it is “divisible into Measures and\nPortions” (437). These attributes cannot be maintained;\ndivisibility and motion cannot “with any tolerable Congruity\nagree to a Spiritual Substance, strictly so call'd” (438).\nFinally, Norris argues that the Quakers' divine light is contingent\nbecause it is a creature, so it cannot convey necessary and eternal\ntruths; only an infinite being can be the source of the eternal truths\n(453–454). The proper way to live a good Christian life, morally and\nintellectually, is to engage one's intellect, “the greatest\nadvantage of thinking is yet behind, that it improves our Morals as\nwell as our Intellectuals; and serves to make us Better, as well as\nWiser” (Miscellanies 151). The Quakers, by emphasizing\nthe passions, takes the Christian far from the intelligible world. \n\nNorris also believed that the Quakers were guilty of the sin of\nschism. Certain nonconformist Christian groups were exempted from\nprosecution by the Toleration Act of 1689, and the Quakers were\namongst these. Norris firmly believed that schism from the Anglican\nChurch was a sin, and believed the Toleration Act merely removed the\nearthly punishment. In The Charge of Schism Continued, Norris\ncites Ephesians 4.3–6, and emphasizes St. Paul's words to the\nEphesians to preserve unity. God commands unity, and schism is a sin\nwhere there is an established Church. Norris divides a law into a\npreceptive and a punitive element. The basis of the punishment is the\nrationale of a law, or the preceptive aspect of a law. The Toleration\nAct merely removes the punitive aspect, leaving the rationale of the\nlaw, which is God's commandment. Furthermore, the justification of all\nhuman law lies in divine law, “If it be further askt, whence has\nthe Law-giver his Authority? I answer, if he be a Creature, he has it\nfrom God, whom I suppose to be the sole Fountain of all Power. But if\nthe Law-giver be God, he has it Originally and Independently in\nhimself” (The Charge 312). Norris held the Toleration\nAct to be a violation of divine law. \n\nOther than his writings on toleration, his sole other published\npolitical work is A Murnival of Knaves issued in 1683 against\nthe Parliamentarians. Norris was a Royalist, but he was not much\nengaged in the volatile politics of his day. A poem in his\nMiscellanies reveals his attitude towards politics: \n\nThe ruination of one's soul for the chance to achieve temporary\ngreatness runs against Norris' basic convictions, the foremost of\nwhich was a life dedicated to the service of God focused upon the\nafterlife. This dearth of political writings reveals a philosopher who\nengaged in intellectual activity because it reveals an orderly\nuniverse governed by the Christian God. Humility is also an important\nvirtue for the Christian, as Norris explains in A Practical\nTreatise concerning Humility published in 1707. In Creation,\nhumanity has a humble role to play – to love and serve\nGod. Political and intellectual endeavors are tools to achieve that\nend. All human thought and institutions should be utilized to serve\nGod's purposes. This theme is also reflected in Norris' 1705 The\nDistinction between High Church and Low Church, distinctly considered\nand fairly treated. \n\nNorris integrates the thought of his predecessors—Descartes,\nMalebranche, Suarez, Augustine, Aquinas and Plato—in a manner\ncentering on the Christian God. God is truth, love and the aim of all\nreligious and practical life. Norris' ambition of completing\nMalebranche's project is reflected in his arguments to establish the\nexistence of the divine ideas and their locus in the mind of God, or\nthe intelligible world. His detailed discussion of the eternal truths\nis a further expansion upon Malebranche's philosophy. The defense of\nDescartes' real distinction proof is enlightening because it renders\ntransparent the assumption of abstractive knowledge that might have\naided contemporary readers' understanding of the proof. If Norris did\nnot venture further into the philosophical, political and scientific\ndebates of his own time, the explanation lies in his advice to never\nstudy out of vanity. Worldly knowledge, such as knowledge of history\nor languages, is a waste of one's time.  Norris was dedicated to the\ncause of knowledge for Christianity's sake, and he saw his own work,\nas well as his predecessors', as attempting to realize fully knowledge\nof the Pauline Doctrine, stated at Acts 17:28, that in God\n“we live, move and have our being.”","contact.mail":"june.yang@gcccd.edu","contact.domain":"gcccd.edu"}]
