Her work continues to strongly\ninfluence philosophers working in action theory and moral\nphilosophy. Like the work of her friend Ludwig Wittgenstein,\nAnscombe’s work is marked by a keen analytic sensibility.\n\n\n\nShe was born in Limerick, Ireland 18 March 1919 to Allen Wells\nAnscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Anscombe (née Thomas). At\nthe time of her birth her father was serving in the British Army.\nThe family later returned to England where Allen Anscombe resumed his\ncareer as a schoolmaster. \n\nAnscombe attended the Sydenham School, graduating in 1937, and went\non to St. Hugh’s College, Oxford. She received a First in\nLiterae Humaniores (Classics and Philosophy) in 1941. After her\ngraduation in 1941 she remained for a while at St. Hugh’s as a\nresearch student, later moving to Newnham College, Cambridge in\n1942. In 1946 she was offered a Research Fellowship at Somerville\nCollege, Oxford and then was appointed to a teaching Fellowship there\nin 1964. She moved from Oxford to Cambridge in 1970 when she was\nawarded a Chair of Philosophy at Cambridge—the Chair formerly\noccupied by Ludwig Wittgenstein. She remained at Cambridge until\nher retirement in 1986. \n\nIn 1938, at Oxford, she met the philosopher Peter Geach. They\nwere both receiving instruction from the same Dominican priest. They\nwere married in 1941. They had three sons and four daughters. \n\nAnscombe did not avoid controversy. In 1956 she publicly\nopposed Oxford University’s decision to award an honorary degree\nto Harry Truman, whom she considered a mass murderer for his decision\nto use atomic weapons against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\nJapan. She also courted controversy with some of her colleagues\nby coming out in print against contraception (see below). \n\nAnscombe continued to produce original work beyond her\nretirement. Peter Geach, for example, reported in\nAnalysis that she had constructed a novel paradox (Geach\n2006, 266–7). \n\nAnscombe died in Cambridge on 5 January 2001. \n\nAnscombe met Wittgenstein at Cambridge, after her graduation from\nOxford. She attended his lectures and became one of his most\ndevoted students. She believed that it was Wittgenstein’s\nlectures, for example, that freed her from the trap of phenomenalism\n(MPM, ix). When she returned to Oxford she continued to travel to\nCambridge to study with Wittgenstein. \n\nAnscombe also became one of Wittgenstein’s good friends and then,\nafter his death in 1951, one of the executors of his literary\nwork. Ray Monk wrote that Anscombe was “…one of\nWittgenstein’s closest friends and one of his most trusted students,\nan exception to his general dislike of academic women and especially\nof female philosophers. She became, in fact, an honorary male,\naddressed by him affectionately as ‘old man’.” (Monk\n1991, 498). \n\nAnscombe translated Wittgenstein’s Philosophical\nInvestigations (1953), and wrote an introduction to the\nTractatus in 1959 (the work had originally been published in\n1921). She organized major publications of Wittgenstein’s\nlater work in, for example, Remarks on Color and\nZettel. She also translated a number of his other works. \n\nSome of Anscombe’s most influential work was on the nature of\ncausation. The relation between cause and effect has been\nnotoriously difficult to analyze. Anscombe’s work in\n“Causality and Determination” challenged some of the\nempiricist orthodoxy of Hume’s account. For example, she\nchallenged the view that the causal relation is characterized by\nconstant conjunction in discussing Feynman’s Geiger counter\ncase: \n\nAnd yet, if the bomb explodes it was caused by the Geiger counter\narrangement. Causation does not involve determination, or\nnecessity. Since the radioactive decay was not sufficient for\nthis effect, the case tells against viewing causes as sufficient\nconditions. There is no general causal connection between cause\nand effect. \n\nThis challenge to the Humean account would turn out to be very\ninfluential—it helped push philosophers towards the development\nof probabilistic accounts of causation to account for the above type of\ncase. \n\nIn terms of categorization, she falls into the singularist camp on\ncausation, since she further rejected the Humean view that causation is\nnot observable in a single instance. On her view the particular cause\nproduces the particular effect. Anscombe produced examples from\nordinary language that seemed to show that we do perceive\ncausation. Such examples are abundant. “I saw her\nclean the dishes” reports the perception of a causal\nprocess. The critic could point out that when we utter\nexpressions such as this we are speaking loosely. Hume certainly\nwouldn’t deny that we say things like this. Rather, the\nclose, probing, examination of a process alone cannot account for\ncausation. \n\nHer work on causation demonstrated reliance on ordinary language\nmethodology. Anscombe also directly contributed to the development of\nkey themes in ordinary language philosophy itself—she influenced\nits content, not simply reliance on it methodologically. This is\nevident in her work on first-person expression. In her paper\n“The First Person” she focuses on Descartes’ use of\n‘I’ in developing his philosophical arguments regarding\nthe existence of the self. On the same grounds as Descartes argues\nthat he can doubt ‘I have a body’ but cannot doubt\n‘I exist’ he can doubt ‘I am Descartes’ but\nnot ‘I exist.’ ‘I am Descartes’, then, is not\nan identity statement.  ‘I’ does not refer like a\nname. In doubting “I am Descartes” he must have\nthe thought “I am not Descartes.” So, in using\n“I,” in this context he is not referring to himself. \n\nWe do tend to think of ‘I’ as simply being that\nexpression people use to refer to themselves. However,\nagain, \n\nThe problem with the reference view of ‘I’ is that when\nsomeone is ignorant of his or her own identity, ‘I’ does\nnot capture what the person has in mind. When a person\n‘speaks of himself’ when he says ‘John drank the\npoison’ not knowing that he himself is John, then he speaks of\nhimself in a purely external way, devoid of self-consciousness that we\nassociate with ‘I’ utterances. So ‘John drank\nthe poison’ does not come off as the same as ‘I drank the\npoison’—John would affirm the first but not the\nsecond. \n\nAgain, this discussion of self-expression would have a great deal of\ninfluence in philosophy of language and mind. How indexicals work\nand function in language, the nature of self-knowledge and\nself-consciousness, and self-identity. \n\nAnscombe’s Intention (1957) is one of the classics of\n20th century philosophy. Indeed, it continues to be a\nstandard point of reference for those working in action theory and\nphilosophical psychology. Like Wittgenstein, Anscombe presented her\nideas in succinct points and numbered sections. However, Anscombe\ndeveloped her own distinctive approach to philosophical analysis.\nHer writing is more direct and argumentative than\nWittgenstein’s. \nIntention is a work on the nature of agency through an\nunderstanding of intention. John Haldane reports that Anscombe wrote\nIntention after puzzling over supporters of Truman:  Anscombe notes that ‘intention’ figures into our\nlanguage in a variety of ways, through different locutions. The three\nshe notes are: \n\nLocution (3) has to do with intention, and one of Anscombe’s concerns\nwas to articulate the distinction between intention\n“simpliciter” and acting intentionally. One of\nthe really interesting questions she considers has to do with the\ndifference between intentions and predictions. Both are future\ndirected. Both seem to require a belief that a future state\nof affairs will occur. Yet, a crucial difference, it seems, is that\nwhen we justify a prediction—such as “It will rain\ntomorrow” we use evidence. On the other hand when we justify an\nintention, such as “I will go to the ice cream shop\ntomorrow,” we give reasons, i.e., “…reasons why it\nwould be useful or attractive if the description came true, not by\nevidence that it is true.” (Intention, 6) \n\nThis passage raises some very deep issues regarding the nature of\nintention. For example, Anscombe seems to indicate that one kind\nof reason relates to the agent’s desires for a certain\nstate of affairs. If I intend to do y must it be the case that I,\nall things considered, want y to come about; or merely that I all\nthings considered want to do y? Michael Bratman (1987) would\nquery this by noting that the belief/desire model of intention fails to\nadequately model the organizational role intentions play in practical\ndeliberation. \n\nAnother of her insights is that when we describe intentional action\nwe are pointing to something for which reasons can be given, and by\n‘reasons’ we do not mean ‘causes.’ So,\nher example is that when someone knocks a glass off of a table he may\ngive an explanation that he saw a face in the window and that made him\njump. This provides a causal explanation for why he knocked the\nglass off the table, but it doesn’t give a reason. The\nknocking of the glass off the table was not intentional, though it was\ncaused by his being startled. \n\nOn Anscombe’s view a particular action can be intentional\nunder one description, but not intentional under\nanother. When I turn on the coffee machine in the\nmorning it is intentional under the description of ‘turn on the\ncoffee machine’ that’s what I intend to do. I will\nalso, let’s say, as a side effect, get my husband to come into\nthe kitchen when he hears the coffee machine go on. That is not\nintentional though. The movement of my hand that turns on\nthe coffee machine is not intentional under the description ‘get\nhusband to come into the kitchen.’ For a bodily movement to\nbe an action it must be intentional under some description. \n\nFurther, on her view intentional action is prior to\nintention to act. That is, to understand what it is to\nintend to act one must understand intentional action. In\nperforming an intentional act we act on reasons (specified by\n‘why?’ questions, as described above). Anscombe herself\nuses the example of someone who is sawing a plank. In sawing the\nplank his action is intentional under one description, that of\n‘sawing the plank,’ though not under the description\n‘making noise.’ So, he is intentionally sawing\nthe plank, though not intentionally making noise since he has no\nintention to make the noise (his reasons for performing the action have\nnothing to do with making noise). We get the claim that\nintentions are necessary for intentional action.\nNonetheless there can be unintentional action, but it will be\nintentional under some other description. \n\nAnscombe’s account of intention and intentional\naction has informed much of the subsequent literature on the\ntopic. Donald Davidson (1980) expanded on her claims regarding\nact identification and agreed that: \n\nThis is known as the Davidson/Anscombe thesis (Wilson, 1989; see also\nthe entry on action).  Davidson, however,\ndisagreed with Anscombe on the issue of reasons as causes. Davidson,\nunlike Anscombe, argued that reason explanation of an action is also a\nkind of causal explanation of the action.  When one explains an action\none cites the belief and the desire that caused the action. The\nreason, in the sense cited by Anscombe, corresponds to what the agent\ndesired. When I go to the ice cream shop to get an ice cream cone I\ndesire an ice cream cone and I believe that I can get one at the ice\ncream shop. This is what causes the intentional action of going to the\nice cream shop. \n\nGeorge Wilson follows Anscombe in that he too believes that an\nexplanation of an action in terms of the reasons for the action is\ngrounded in the intention behind the action (Wilson 1989). This will\nprove problematic when we look at the connection between philosophy of\npsychology and moral psychology. \n\nOne of the most significant ideas elaborated on in\nIntention is ‘direction of fit.’ Though the\nnotion seems to have originated with J.L. Austin, Anscombe is credited\nwith a clear explication of it. ‘Direction of fit’ was how\nJohn Searle referred to Anscombe’s idea that there are two things\nthat we can do with words—sometimes we try to get the\nwords to match, or fit with, what’s in the world, and other times\nwe try to get the world to fit with the words. This turned out to\nbe important in speech act theory since speech acts exemplify one\ndirection of fit. When one utters a command, for example, one is\nnot trying to describe the world or make an assertion that is supposed\nto match with what is in the world. Rather, the point is to bring\nabout a state of affairs in the\n world.[1] \n\nConsider this famous passage from Intention: \n\n‘Direction-of-fit’ has proven useful to understanding the difference\nbetween mental states like belief and desire. Beliefs describe the\nworld, desires are not descriptive. Desires effect change in the\nworld. Thus, desires themselves are not true or false, though they may\nbe based on beliefs which are true or false.  Thus intuitive way of\ndemarcating the function of belief and desire helps to clarify\ndifferent theories of normativity and what is at stake between those\ntheories. A desire based theory, for example, might not be committed\nto truth or falsity of moral claims.  This is important, too, in\naccounting for differences between speculative, or theoretical,\nknowledge and reasoning and practical knowledge and reasoning. \n\nAnscombe applied her views on intention to clarify her own\npositions on controversial claims, such as the condemnation of\ncontraception. One puzzle in Catholic doctrine condemning\ncontraception, and yet allowing for the ‘rhythm method’ of\navoiding pregnancy, is to reconcile the rationales in a consistent\nway. Many charged the Church with inconsistency, since the\nintention to not get pregnant during intercourse is present in both\ncases. Anscombe claims the intentions differ. \n\nHer claim is that the further intentions that accompany these actions\nare the same, but that the kind of intentional act one is performing\nin each case differs in a very significant way. Her claim is that use\nof contraception, unlike timing intercourse to coincide with infertile\nperiods, is a bad sort of action because in the case of sexual\nintercourse “…to intend such an act is not to intend a\nmarriage act at all, whether or no we’re married” (CC, 136). When one\nengages in sexual intercourse using contraceptives one has the\nintention of rendering oneself infertile, one is not acting with the\nintention of engaging in normal sexual intercourse, just at an\ninfertile time. Even though both types of action have the further aim\nof limiting family size, the basic intentions are different. That is,\nthe intentions that define the acts themselves are different. The\nperversion of the sex act in marriage is, in this one way, like\nwriting a forged check for a good cause, she claims. The further\nintention of, let’s say, helping the needy is a worthy one but does\nnot vindicate the action of forging the check. Needless to say, this\nview was enormously controversial. \n\nBernard Williams and Michael Tanner criticized her argument\nfor failing to consider one of her own theses—that actions,\nincluding sorts of actions, can fall under a variety of\ndescriptions. On their view, she is picking and choosing\ndescriptions of actions in order to get the outcome she wants—a\ndistinction between rhythm method and contraception that isn’t\njust a trivial distinction. But, they argue, she cannot do this\nconvincingly. They argue that couples who employ the rhythm\nmethod are taking steps to achieve infertility just as those who take\ncontraception are. Those steps are central to understanding the\nacts themselves, not simply the further purpose of the acts. (Williams\nand Tanner 1972) \n\nAnscombe’s views on intention also figured largely in her defense and\narticulation of the Doctrine of Double Effect, which will be discussed\nin more detail below. \n\nAnscombe’s article “Modern Moral Philosophy”\nstimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to\nUtilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her\nprimary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral\ntheory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as\n‘morally ought,’ ‘morally obligated,’\n‘morally right,’ and so forth that are legalistic and\nrequire a legislator as the source of moral authority. In the\npast God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part\nof the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful\nemployment of those concepts. \n\nThere are two ways to read this article. The first is to read it\nstraightforwardly as an indictment of the moral theories prevalent in\nthe 1950s and a subsequent argument for the development of an\nalternative theory of morality that does not postulate a legislator,\nbut then also does not try to keep the defunct legislative structure\nthat naturally falls out of religiously based ethics. On this view we\nneed to develop an alternative that is based on moral psychology,\nmoral virtue, facts of human nature, and an account of the good for\nhumans based on this approach. A major mistake made by modern moral\nphilosophers is that they try to provide an account of ‘morally\nright or morally wrong’ that really has no content outside of\nthe legislative arena provided by the divine. Anscombe writes:\n“It would be most reasonable to drop it. It has no reasonable\nsense outside a law conception of ethics; they are not going to\nmaintain such a conception; and you can do ethics without it, as is\nshown by the example of Aristotle. It would be great improvement if,\ninstead of ‘morally wrong,’ one always named a genus such\nas ‘untruthful’, ‘unchaste’,\n‘unjust’ ” (MMP, 8–9). \n\nThus, many take her to be arguing for this alternative—the\nalternative that, like Aristotle’s account, relies on richer, or\n‘thick’ concepts such as ‘just’ as opposed to\n‘thin’ concepts such as ‘morally wrong’\nwhich—outside of a certain metaphysical perspective—lacks\ncontent. \n\nThis quite naturally then leads to an emphasis on developing a\nvirtue ethics that would be distinct from the modern approaches\nAnscombe attacks in MMP. \n\nThis is the prevalent reading of MMP and the reason why it is widely\ninterpreted as encouraging a virtue ethical approach to moral\ntheory. For example, Crisp and Slote note that Anscombe suggests\nthe alternative that “…ethics can be based, instead, on\nthe idea of a virtue…”, but, as they also note, this idea\nitself is also not clear and that what we need to be doing is some\nbasic moral psychology to get clarity on notions such as\n‘intention,’ ‘desire,’ ‘action,’\nand so forth (1997, 4). Yet another crucial notion, for the sake\nof understanding virtue, is ‘human flourishing.’\nAnscombe is doubtful we will be able to reach a satisfactory\nunderstanding of this notion. \n\nAn alternative reading is as a modus tollens argument\nintended to establish the superiority of a religious based ethics. (For\nmore on a skeptical reading of MMP, see Crisp 2004.) Assume for the\nsake of argument there is no God, and religiously based moral theory is\nincorrect. On Anscombe’s view modern theories such as\nKantian ethics, Utilitarianism, and social contract theory are sorely\ninadequate for a variety of reasons, but one major worry is that they\ntry to adopt the legalistic framework without the right background\nassumptions to ground it. An alternative would be to develop a\nkind of naturalized approach where we carefully consider moral\npsychology as it relates to the human good. However, this\napproach itself is problematic. The prospect of articulating a\ncomplete and plausible account of the human good along these lines is\ndim. \n\nHere is the straightforward interpretation in simple modus\nponens form: \n\nBut one person’s modus ponens is another\nperson’s modus tollens: \n\nThus, according to the alternative reading, one can conclude that\nAnscombe is arguing that the only suitable and really viable\nalternative is the religiously based moral theory that keeps the\nlegalistic framework and the associated concepts of\n‘obligation.’ This interpretation is more in keeping with\nAnscombe’s religious views and with her other ethical views\nregarding absolute prohibitions. There were plenty of actions she\ntook to be morally wrong, so it seems clear—as Simon Blackburn\nnoted—that she herself was not out to jettison these\nterms. But one can defend an even stronger claim. MMP is a\ncarefully crafted argument intended to show the absurdity of rejecting\nthe religious framework—along with it’s metaphysical\nunderpinnings—when it comes to moral\n authority.[2]\nBut many readers simply\nstuck to the straightforward modus ponens reading of the\nargument. Support for (2b) is provided by her doubts that\nvirtue ethics can really get off the ground as a normative theory using\na distinctly ‘moral’ ought. In MMP she writes about\npursuing the project of ethics as Plato and Aristotle pursued it, along\nvirtue ethical lines: \n\nBut, by and large, MMP was read against a backdrop in which a\nreligious basis for ethics had been discredited. Thus many\nwriters took up the challenge to develop a psychologically rich virtue\nethics rather than abandon secular morality. \n\nThe article has clearly had an impact on the development of virtue\nethics. Part of its influence can be traced to its negative\nassessment of the leading theories of the day, particularly\nUtilitarianism and Kantian Ethics. On her view,\nUtilitarianism commits one to endorsing evil deeds, and Kantian ethics,\nwith its notion of ‘self-legislation’ is just\nincoherent. If the main choices are either evil or incoherent,\nthat’s a serious problem and calls for the development of some\nalternative approach. Unfortunately, perhaps, for\nAnscombe’s overall project, her audience regarded the\nsupernaturalized approach as more problematic than the naturalized . If\nwe are to go back to very early approaches, such as Aristotle’s,\nthen the natural approach to developing the alternatives is as a\n‘virtue ethics’ and digging into the messy issue of human\nflourishing and good. \n\nMMP also touched a nerve with philosophers who advocated one or the\nother of the condemned views. One reason for this was the rather\ndismissive or moralistic tone she took in some of her criticisms.\nPerhaps one of the more well known is given in the following passage\nwhen she condemns Utilitarianism—or, more\ngenerally—Consequentialism, for leaving open the possibility\nthat it may be morally right in some context to advocate the execution\nof an innocent person. \n\nShe wrote: \n\nAnscombe is not making a subtle point here, and this comment prodded\nphilosophers such as Jonathan Bennett to defend the view that\nconsequences certainly mattered in determining the moral\nquality of an action—indeed, he questions the adequacy of\naccounts that rely on a dubious act/consequence distinction. This does\nnot by itself get one to Consequentialism. Indeed, Anscombe’s comment\nhere goes beyond a mere condemnation of Consequentialism to a further\ncondemnation of any view in which consequences are weighed in\ndetermining moral rightness or wrongness. She is a moral\nabsolutist. Some things are wrong and ought not to be done, whatever\nthe consequences. So, for example, Bennett was concerned to undercut a\npopular distinction between killing versus letting die which was made\non the basis that killing is just the sort of act that is wrong,\nperiod, no matter what the consequences, whereas letting die is not as\nbad as killing, even if the consequences were the same and were known\nto be the same. \n\nThus, a person’s doing a results in an upshot x and\nat one end of the action scale a is the one action that can\nresult in x; refraining from a is compatible with a whole\nrange of alternative actions—walking to the grocery store,\nweeding in the garden, reading a book—all of which\nhave x as a result.  But there is no morally relevant\ndifference, here. There is nothing in the ‘act itself’ of\nkilling that distinguishes it, in a morally relevant way, from letting\ndie when things like immediacy, intention, and so forth are held\nconstant. \n\nAnscombe’s comment on Bennett’s criticism comprises one of the\nbriefest philosophical essays, which I quote in its entirety here: \nAside from the profound problem of commending vicious acts, Anscombe\nalso believed that consequentialism failed to capture, indeed, must\nfail to capture, crucial elements of moral psychology.  The theory\ncannot account for backward looking justifications, or reasons, for\nperforming certain actions. Teichmann notes, in his work on Anscombe,\nthat, though it seems superficially intuitive that reasons are\nunderstood in causal terms, this does not, in Anscombe’s opinion,\nwithstand scrutiny. In response to “Why did you kill him?”\n(using Anscombe’s own example), Teichmann holds that though one\nintuitive reason might be “In order to get revenge”, it is\nalso the case, in Anscombe’s view, “…the sense of\n‘In order to get revenge’ in fact presupposes the force of\nsuch reasons as ‘Because he killed my brother’, and\nnot vice versa” (Teichmann, 124). \nThe absolutist stance informed a good deal of her other work in moral\nphilosophy. In her famous pamphlet Mr. Truman’s Degree\n(1958), Anscombe protested Oxford’s decision to award Harry Truman an\nhonorary doctorate. Her view was that Truman murdered large numbers of\ninnocent persons, civilians, with nuclear weapons in order to get\nJapan to surrender. On her view, the end does not justify the\nmeans. It is not permissible to kill innocents for the sake of some\ngreater good to be realized as a consequence of such action. Some,\nthough it is worth pointing out not all, consequentialists will\ndisagree that such cases are just out of the question (and many\nstraightforward consequentialists could well agree that Truman was not\nan example of someone using means/end reasoning in a justifiable way).\nAnscombe’s discussion, though, informed later discussions of absolute\nprohibitions in wartime such as Thomas Nagel’s discussion of the\nattractive features of the absolutist position in “War and\nMassacre” (1972).  Anscombe’s work in ethics dovetailed, in many ways, with the\nwork of contemporaries Philippa Foot and Iris Murdoch.  All were\nopposed to Utilitarianism, and were suspicious of the\n’thin’ evaluative terms that were adopted by the\ntheory. Of course, this criticism was not restricted to\nUtilitarianism.  Any theory predominantly employing thin moral\nconcepts such as ’right’ and ’wrong’ were\nsubject to this line of criticism.  Thin moral concepts are opposed to\n’thick’ ones.  Bernard Williams famously characterized\nthick concepts this way:  Virtue terms are thick. To describe an action as\n’cowardly’ provides much more information than to describe\nit as ’wrong’. Further, thin terms can lead us astray. In\nMMP, after describing the Utilitarian commitment to be open, in\nprinciple, to “… judicially punishing a man for what he is\nclearly understood not to have done …”, which is clearly\n’unjust’, she writes: \n\nAnscombe also defended a version of the doctrine of double effect, and\nher commitment to this Doctrine provided a principle she used to try\nto show what was corrupt about Truman’s action. The basic idea is that\nthere is a morally relevant distinction between intended versus merely\nforeseen outcomes. To intend harm is worse than to merely foresee harm\nas a result of one’s action.  This can sometimes be combined with a\nkind of absolutism to hold that intended harms are forbidden whereas\nthe merely foreseen may not be. It is frequently used to try to\nunderwrite a moral distinction between a strategic bomber and a terror\nbomber. What a strategic bomber does in dropping a bomb may be\npermissible because he does not intend to kill innocent civilians even\nthough he foresees that they will die as a result of the bombing. A\nterror bomber, on the other hand, does intend to kill innocent\ncivilians as a way to achieve his aims. \n\nAnscombe’s own position varied somewhat over the course of her\ncareer. \n\nIn “War and Murder,” published in 1961, Anscombe notes that\nthe moral permissibility of coercive authority requires a principle\nthat can be used to differentiate the just imposition of harms from\nthe unjust. The Doctrine of Double Effect is one such principle. At\nthe root of the principle is the distinction between intended and\nforeseen consequences of an action. While there is some debate on the\ncorrect specification of the Doctrine, the basic idea is that it is\nworse to intend harm than to merely foresee it. In Anscombe’s opinion,\nsome actions are absolutely forbidden because they involve intentions\nto harm whereas if the harm in question was merely foreseen the action\nwould not be forbidden. \n\nBut she was also concerned that the Doctrine of Double Effect was\noften abused. For example, one constraint on the Doctrine holds\nthat one cannot intend the means to the desired end. So, a doctor\nmay administer a drug to alleviate pain though knowing that another\neffect of the drug will be the death of the patient. This is\npermitted. One way to understand how this works is by employing a\ncounterfactual test—if the doctor could alleviate the pain of\nthe patient without administering such strong medication she\nwould. What is not permitted by Double Effect is using the bad\neffect as a means to achieving one’s goal. \n\nSome have held the view that one can direct one’s intentions a certain\nway to achieve the desired result with moral impunity. If, for\nexample, one tells oneself that one is only intending x by\ndoing y, then one is off the hook even if y is\nimmoral—and this strikes Anscombe as quite absurd. Her example\nis that of a servant who holds the ladder for his master who is a\nthief and justifies it by telling himself that his intention is simply\nto avoid getting fired. Holding the ladder is his means of avoiding\nthe loss of his job. It is still immoral. Because of the means/end\nconstraint on Double Effect, holding the ladder is not justified. And\nthis misunderstanding of Double Effect was at the basis of Anscombe’s\nproblem with wartime bombing and the flagrant misuse of Double Effect\nto justify it. \n\nAgain, in order to employ DDE one needs the distinction between\nintended and merely foreseen consequences of the ‘act\nitself.’ On Anscombe’s view some actions are in and of\nthemselves immoral, regardless of the consequences one intends to bring\nabout in the performance of the action, and certainly regardless of\nwhat one foresees as a result of the action. But many\nconsequentialists don’t recognize a morally relevant\ndistinction between intention and foresight. Jonathan Bennett,\nfor example, was highly critical of this distinction. \n\nThere’s no doubt that it can be extremely difficult to parse\ndouble effect. It is often presented in the following way.\nThere is an action that the agent performs which has two effects, one\ngood, one bad. The action may still be permissible given that the\nintended effect that is desired by the agent is good, and given that\nthe bad effect is merely foreseen, and not intended. It appears\nthat the agent voluntarily chooses both effects, but is only fully\naccountable for one. And this strikes some as odd, since it just\nseems obvious that foreseen consequences have to be weighed—it\nwould be irresponsible not to weigh them. So surely they count\ntoo? \n\nBut Joseph Boyle makes a maneuver that might help Anscombe\nhere. He argues that the unintended effect is not voluntarily\nchosen (in the morally relevant sense of ‘chosen’\nfor which we hold people responsible) even though the agent knows that\nit will occur as a result of his actions.  The reason for Boyle is\nthat the foreseen consequences—though definitely factored into\ndeliberation—are not factored in the right way to count as\nvoluntarily chosen. The foreseen effects are not reasons for\naction; rather, as Boyle notes, “…they are sometimes\nconditions in spite of which one acts” (1980,\n535). We can consider another of Anscombe’s famous cases to\nillustrate this. Anscombe publicly protested Oxford University’s\nawarding to an honorary degree to Harry Truman. Truman, on her view,\nwas a mass murderer. As we noted earlier, she was disgusted by the\nattempts of some individuals to excuse Truman by using double\neffect. Truman, she argued, dropped the bomb on those\ncities, not in spite of the civilian population, but at least\nin part because of that population. He could have chosen an isolated\nlocation for a demonstration. There was evidence that the Japanese did\nwant to negotiate. On Anscombe’s view Truman was using the innocent\ncivilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to achieve his ends. She believed\nthat their presence entered into his deliberation as a positive\nfactor, not as a detracting factor. This, then, would be a case of\nterror bombing, and of outright murder. \n\nWhile it is true that there is a big difference between terror bombing\nand strategic bombing, some question, however, that DDE accounts for\nthat difference. One might argue that to the extent Truman desired the\nevil outcome of the deaths of innocent civilians what he did was\nmurder. This does not rely on acceptance of DDE to account for a\ndifference. Jonathan Bennett points out that it can be really\ndifficult to parse a meaningful difference using DDE. For example, the\ncounterfactual test so many proponents of DDE use doesn’t work to\ndistinguish the terror from the strategic cases. As Bennett notes,\n“The tactical bomber’s wish for the civilian deaths is a\nreluctant one: if he could, he would destroy the factory without\nkilling civilians. But the terror bomber too, if he could, would drop\nhis bombs in such a way as to lower enemy morale without killing\ncivilians” (Bennett 1995, 222).  If Truman wanted to kill\ncivilians, what he did was wrong, but not\nbecause of a violation of DDE. It was wrong because he\nintentionally and knowingly caused immense suffering that could have\nbeen avoided through an alternative course of action. Of course, one\ncould still argue that DDE is a very useful heuristic—it tracks\njustification even if it doesn’t itself underwrite that\njustification. However, even this picture of DDE has been attacked by\nresearchers studying our reactions to moral dilemma cases, who hold\nthat we do not consciously employ anything like DDE in making moral\ndecisions (Greene, et al., 2009). \n\nG. E. M. Anscombe’s work ranged over many years and many\ndifferent areas in philosophy. The breadth of her work is\nimpressive. She was systematic in her thinking, seeing and\ndeveloping connections between metaphysics, moral psychology, and\nethics that exhibited not simply a grasp of one particular\nproblem, but a world view. Her legacy is one of the broadest and\ndeepest left by a 20th century philosopher."}]
