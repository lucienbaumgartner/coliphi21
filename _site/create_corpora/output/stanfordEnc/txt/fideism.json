In contrast to the\nmore rationalistic tradition of natural theology, with its arguments\nfor the existence of God, fideism holds—or at any rate\nappears to hold (more on this caveat shortly)—that\nreason is unnecessary and inappropriate for the exercise and\njustification of religious belief. The term itself derives from\nfides, the Latin word for faith, and can be rendered\nliterally as faith-ism. “Fideism” is thus to be\nunderstood not as a synonym for “religious belief,” but as\ndenoting a particular philosophical account of faith’s appropriate\njurisdiction vis-a-vis that of reason.\n\nAlvin Plantinga has noted that fideism can be defined as an\n“exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a\nconsequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the\npursuit of philosophical or religious truth” (87).\nCorrespondingly, Plantinga writes, a fideist is someone who\n“urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters\nphilosophical and religious” and who “may go on to\ndisparage and denigrate reason” (87). Notice, first, that what\nthe fideist seeks, according to this account, is truth.\nFideism claims that truths of a certain kind can be grasped only by\nforegoing rational inquiry and relying solely on faith. Insofar as\nfideism insists that knowledge of these truths is possible, it must be\ndistinguished from various forms of skepticism with which it otherwise\nshares certain common features. Notice too that this definition is\nlargely formal; the plausibility of fideism as a philosophical\ndoctrine and the proper extension of the term will therefore depend on\nthe content given to the terms “faith” and\n“reason.” \nThe formality of definitions like the one cited by Plantinga is likely\nto conceal underlying disagreements about what counts as a concrete\ninstance of fideism. Indeed, there is little agreement among\nphilosophers about which thinkers can properly be subsumed under this\nrubric. To offer a straight “history of fideism” would\nthus require one to take up a particular position with respect to a\nseries of ongoing philosophical disputes. This section thus\nattempts—somewhat less ambitiously, though perhaps more\ncharitably—to sketch a brief history not of fideism but of\n“fideism”—i.e., of the term’s (contested) usage\nwithin the philosophical literature. \nThe term “fideism” appears to have entered the\nphilosophical lexicon by way of theology in the late nineteenth\ncentury. It was originally used in reference to a movement within\nRoman Catholic thought, also known as traditionalism, which\nemphasized, over against rationalism, the role of tradition as the\nmedium by means of which divine revelation is communicated, and which\nwas sometimes conjoined with a conservative social and political\nagenda. Although of late modern vintage, the term\n“fideism” has since been applied retrospectively to\nthinkers at least as far back as the second century C.E. \nTertullian is frequently cited in this connection as a textbook\nfideist. Developing a theme articulated by Paul in his First Letter to\nthe Corinthians, Tertullian insisted that the truth of Christianity\ncould be disclosed only by revelation, and that it must necessarily\nremain opaque to unregenerate philosophical\n reason.[1]\n In an oft-quoted passage he maintains (against Marcion) that the\nBiblical narrative of Christ’s death and resurrection “is by all\nmeans to be believed, because it is absurd…[T]he fact is\ncertain, because it is impossible” (525). \nHowever, the conception of Tertullian as anti-rational is not\nsupported by contemporary scholarship. Contrary to popular belief,\nwhat Tertullian said is not credo quia absurdum but\ncredible est quia ineptum est. Tertullian’s point seems to\nhave been that the incarnation represents a paradox: salvation\nrequires both that God become human and that God remain wholly other.\nHis quarrel was not with reason per se, but with\nphilosophical hubris. Eric Osborne writes, “Not only did he\nnever say ‘credo quia absurdum’, but he never\nmeant anything like it and never abandoned the claims of Athens upon\nJerusalem” (28). Tertullian, Osborne concludes, was a\n“most improbable fideist” (29). \nDuring the Middle Ages, efforts to reconcile Christian doctrine with\nAristotelian logic—newly reintroduced into European thought via\nthe translation of Aristotle’s corpus from Greek and Arabic—gave\nrise to a family of positions that Sheila Delany groups together under\nthe label “skeptical fideism.” By distinguishing the\nrevealed truths of the Christian religion, which can be accepted only\nvia what they posited as a distinct faculty of faith, from the\nknowledge-claims to which the dialectical method is relevant,\nthirteenth-century thinkers like Boetius of Dacia and his colleague\nSiger de Brabant sought a theo-philosophico rapprochement (Delany,\n13-17). Pragmatically, this appeal to faith was in the service less of\nsafeguarding Christian faith than of loosening ecclesiastical\nconstraints on philosophy. Summarizing these developments, Delany\nwrites: \nThe freedom claimed for philosophy was nevertheless a “limited\nfreedom”: “Indeed logic was still restrained by the very\ndevice that freed it, for as long as doctrine was acknowledged to be\nsupreme, and God’s will the highest cause, then reason and experience\ncould attain only relative validity” (Delany, 21). \nMoreover, theology had reasons of its own to be suspicious of\nexperience and (what passes for) reason. Of central importance in this\nregard is the idea that one’s rational faculties can be damaged by\nsin. Although this idea was articulated by a variety of early\nChristian theologians including Tertullian and Augustine (and has\nobvious analogues in classical virtue theory), it came to be given\nspecial attention within the Protestant tradition. The reformers held\nthat the human intellect had been corrupted by humanity’s fall from\ngrace, and that consequently the truth of Christianity could be\napprehended only by faith. Protestant theologians from Luther and\nCalvin to Karl Barth have thus affirmed the priority of faith not only\nto “works” but also to natural theology. \nWithin Roman Catholicism, by contrast, greater weight has\ncharacteristically been given to the classic arguments for God’s\nexistence. (It is, however, doubtful that these arguments were\nhistorically ever intended as freestanding proofs that would be\nconvincing to atheists. For an illuminating discussion of the\nfunctions of such arguments in pre-modern and early-modern contexts,\nsee Clayton, Parts II and III.) This theological division thus\nrepresents part of the context for the debate over fideism. It is\ninteresting in this connection to note that the Roman Catholic\nMagisterium has repeatedly condemned fideism. Absent from the\ndocuments of Vatican I, the term makes what seems to be its first\nappearance in a papal encyclical in 1907, in Pius X’s Pascendi\nDominici Gregis (see Other Internet Resources), where fideism is\nreferenced in the context of a more sweeping critique of\n“modernist”\n theology.[2]\n More recently, in the 1998 encyclical Fides et Ratio (see\nOther Internet Resources), John Paul II warned of “a resurgence\nof fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of\nrational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding\nof faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God”\n(§55), and in Caritas In Veritate (2009, see Other\nInternet Resources), his third encyclical, Benedict XVI writes,\n“Truth frees charity from the constraints of an emotionalism\nthat deprives it of relational and social content, and of a fideism\nthat deprives it of human and universal breathing-space”\n(§3). This emphasis on reason in general, and on natural theology\nin particular, may help in part to explain how the term\n“fideism” has come to function within Roman Catholic\ntheology largely as a term of opprobrium. \nOn the other hand—and in a sort of ironic twist—the\ncounter-Reformation also launched a defense of Catholicism that some\nhistorians have described as fideistic. The Protestant Reformation\ncoincided with the re-discovery in Europe of the ancient skeptical\narguments of Sextus Empiricus, Cicero, and Diogenes Laertius, and as\nRichard H. Popkin has demonstrated, these arguments were quickly\nappropriated by sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Catholic\nphilosophers and theologians—including Erasmus, Montaigne,\nPierre Charron, and Petrus Gassendi (as well as by Protestant thinkers\nlike Pierre Bayle)—who deployed them in the religious\ncontroversies of the\n period.[3]\n Their contention was simple, if something of an ignoratio\nelenchi: since skepticism undermines any reason for becoming a\nProtestant, one should remain a Catholic on the basis of faith alone\n(Popkin 1992, 122–123). \nBut although the Protestant reformers and these “nouveaux\nPyrrhoniens” both relied on skeptical arguments to deflate the\npretensions of philosophical “reason,” they tended to draw\nsomewhat different conclusions about the role and nature of faith. In\nthe face of uncertainty the latter counseled their readers to remain\nloyal to the prevailing religious conventions of the time—in\nthis case Roman Catholicism. But they tended to eschew the religious\nenthusiasm characteristic of the more pietistic Protestant sects.\nTheirs was thus a temperate and tentative faith, grounded in action\nrather than doctrine. If they were fideistic, they were nevertheless\nnot dogmatic. According to the reformed view, by contrast, the domain\nof faith is characterized by fervor and passionate commitment:\nskepticism thus ultimately gives way to certainty and religious\nassurance of a kind unassailable by philosophical doubt. In his book\nGod and Skepticism, Terence Penelhum calls the latter view\n“evangelical fideism,” and he distinguishes it from the\n“conformist fideism” that identifies faith with loyalty to\na tradition (15–16). \nThe theological developments in the nineteenth century in reference to\nwhich the term “fideism” was first used had their\nphilosophical inspiration not simply in the skepticism of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, however, but also, and more\nimmediately, in Immanuel Kant’s critical philosophy. For Kant, God’s\nexistence was a postulate of practical—rather than\npure—reason. Accordingly, Kant rejected the traditional\n“proofs” of God’s existence—the cosmological,\nteleological, and ontological arguments—in favor of a moral\nargument. Thus, although Kant famously championed the conception of a\nthoroughly “rational” (i.e., moral) version of\nChristianity—a “religion within the limits of reason\nalone”—he also placed religious belief outside the domain\nof what can be known by means of speculative philosophy. In this way,\nhe “found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to\nmake room for faith” (1929, 29). \nThe earliest documented uses of the term “fideism” are to\nbe found in French theology. Thomas D. Carroll has located references\nto fidéisme from as early as 1854 (2008, 10); however,\nthe term appears to have entered into broader circulation in the\nliterature a quarter-century later, when it came to be used\npejoratively in reference to Catholic traditionalism by theologians\nseeking to revive the Thomistic synthesis of reason and faith. \nAt around the same time or shortly thereafter, Carroll argues, the\nterm appears to have originated independently in the work of the\nFrench Protestant theologians Eugèene Ménégoz\n(1838–1921) and Auguste Sabatier (1839–1901), who (unlike\nthe Catholic traditionalists of whom it was predicated by their\ncritics) applied it to themselves. Ménégoz and Sabatier\nboth sought to distinguish faith—understood in terms of\nsomething akin to Schleiermacher’s feeling of absolute\ndependence—from propositional belief, arguing that salvation\ndepends on the former, rather than on assent to any particular\ndoctrine. Because of Sabatier’s emphasis on religious symbols, this\nview was sometimes called\n “symbolo-fideism.”[4] \nAs Carroll observes, the projection of the term “fideism”\nahistorically—onto thinkers as removed from the context in which\nit originated as Tertullian—is potentially the source of much\nconfusion, given that the meanings of key terms like\n“faith” and “reason” vary dramatically from\none context to another. Moreover, the term’s presently widespread\npejorative connotations render “fideism” problematic as a\ndescriptive category. \nToday the term “fideism” is perhaps most commonly\nassociated with four philosophers: Pascal, Kierkegaard, James, and\nWittgenstein. In order to assess how well the label fits, it will be\nhelpful to discuss their respective views in slightly more detail.\nNote, however, that each is also treated at greater length elsewhere\nin this encyclopedia. \nWhereas Montaigne’s followers, though significant theological figures\nin their day, “showed no particular fervor in their religious\nviews” and practiced a “tepid, if sincere” form of\nCatholicism (Popkin 1992, 124), the same could not be said of Blaise\nPascal (1623–1662), whose Pensées attest to a\nmore “evangelical” brand of Pyrrhonian piety. Following a\ntransformative mystical experience in 1654, Pascal spent much of the\nremainder of his life in the monasteries of Port-Royal, working out a\ndefense of his faith. \nCentral to this defense, seemingly paradoxically, is the conviction\nthat belief in God cannot be defended by means of the usual apologetic\narguments. The very nature of what is believed in—namely, an\n“infinitely incomprehensible” being—is such as to\nrender these arguments necessarily inadequate. \nThe most the philosophical arguments could prove, Pascal suggests, is\nthe “god of the philosophers”—not the “God of\nAbraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” \nPascal insists that faith can nevertheless be rational in the absence\nof proof—i.e., that it is rational in a prudential rather than\nan epistemic sense. It is here that he introduces his celebrated\n“Wager” arguments. Pascal’s first move in the argument is\na skeptical one. He argues that although God either exists or does not\nexist, we cannot settle the issue on the basis of reason alone. The\nproofs of God’s existence are not conclusive, but neither are the\nproofs of God’s non-existence. “Reason can determine\nnothing” (201). \nGranting that reason is indeed neutral with respect to the question of\nwhether or not God exists, it might at first be thought that the\nsafest and most rational course of action would be to refuse to take a\nstand one way or the other—to remain agnostic about the\nexistence of God. However, Pascal argues that this is not possible:\nnot choosing to believe is equivalent to choosing\nnot to believe. If you do not choose for God, you in\neffect choose against God. But on what basis, then, should\none decide? \nThe solution, Pascal argues, is to weigh the potential rewards of\nbelieving in God against the potential rewards of failing to believe\nin God—i.e., to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the relative\nmerits of “wagering” for or against God’s existence. The\noptions, as Pascal construes them, can be outlined in the form of a\ntable: \nThese options can be assessed in terms of what is known within\ncontemporary decision theory as the Expected Value Principle (EVP).\nThe EVP states that when one is faced with a choice among competing\ncourses of action, one should choose whichever has the highest\n“expected value.” Expected value can be calculated by (a)\nmultiplying the probability of a successful outcome by the value of\nthat outcome; (b) multiplying the probability of an unsuccessful outcome by\nthe cost of that outcome; and (c) taking the sum of the results\nof (a) and (b). In light of the EVP it can be rational to gamble on an\nimprobable outcome given a sufficiently high potential payoff. \nOf course, in the case of God, it is hard to determine what the\nchances of a successful outcome might be: we cannot justifiably\nassume, for example, that the likelihood of God existing is equal to\nthe likelihood of God not existing. But that is irrelevant, Pascal\nargues, because the payoff if God exists is an infinite\npayoff. Thus, the potential for infinite gain makes it rational to bet\nthat God exists, however slim the actual chances of this might be: as\nlong as one is willing to grant that there is “one chance of\nwinning against a finite number of chances of losing,” it is a\nbetter deal to bet on God (202–203). \nAlthough Pascal’s argument seems to be valid—that is, its\nconclusion follows logically from its premises—Pascal’s critics\nhave raised a number of other objections to it. In the first place, it\nhas been said that any argument which seeks to justify faith entirely\nin such crassly prudential terms is necessarily impious or improper.\nTo be sure, it is hard to avoid feeling, as William James put it,\n“that when religious faith expresses itself thus, in the\nlanguage of the gaming-table, it is put to its last trumps” (6).\nJames went on to remark that “if we were ourselves in the place\nof the Deity, we should probably take particular pleasure in cutting\noff believers of this pattern from their infinite reward” (6).\nIn fairness, however, it should be noted that Pascal’s use of the\n“Wager” is merely instrumental. It is intended simply as a\nfirst step toward, and not as a substitute for, genuine religious\nfaith. Furthermore, the claim that it is somehow improper to base such\na decision on prudential reasons seems to presuppose precisely what\nPascal denies—namely, that there are epistemic reasons on which\none’s decision might more appropriately be made to rest. It is\nimportant to appreciate that Pascal is not urging his readers to\nbelieve something they otherwise have reason to doubt. As he puts it,\n“Your reason is not more deeply wounded by choosing one rather\nthan the other because it is bound to choose” (202). \nBut can one choose to believe for purely instrumental reasons? A\nsecond worry is that Pascal’s argument seems to presuppose a\nproblematic version of doxastic voluntarism, the view that\nbelieving is subject to the will. Believing in God, unlike raising\none’s arm, it might be objected, is not open to direct voluntary\ncontrol. However, Pascal anticipates this objection, arguing that a\nwould-be believer should begin by imitating the motions of a believer.\nBy, for instance, attending Mass and taking holy water, a would-be\nbeliever may succeed in cultivating genuine belief. This argument\nsuggests that Pascal is committed to the less controversial thesis of\nindirect doxastic voluntarism—the view that a person\ncan indirectly control his or her beliefs by directly controlling his\nor her epistemic situation. Still, the prospect of voluntarily\ninducing belief for purely non-epistemic reasons has struck many\ncommentators as manipulative and self-deceptive. \nA third problem is that Pascal’s argument depends upon an overly\nnarrow construal of one's religious options. It is of course the case,\nas Pascal claims, that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob either\nexists or does not exist, but the same is true of a seemingly endless\nnumber of other possible deities. If we assume the possibility of\ninfinite reward in each case, it is no longer clear that Catholicism\nis any more rational than its religious alternatives. In reply, Jeff\nJordan recently has argued that the “Wager” can be\nreconfigured to show, not that one religion is more rational than\nanother, but simply that atheism and agnosticism are irrational. \nJordan follows Pascal in treating religious belief as a necessary\nprerequisite for eternal happiness. However, some critics have\nquestioned this assumption. How do we know—it might be\nasked—that if he or she exists, God would make salvation\ncontingent on correct belief? Pascal seems to vacillate between a\nprofessed ignorance of God’s nature and some rather doctrinaire\nassumptions about it. Indeed, if one grants that there is even a small\nchance of achieving infinite bliss by pursuing a\nnon-religious path, then the EVP suggests that such a path\nwould be just as rational in light of its expected value.  \nAlthough Pascal’s “Wager” is widely regarded as having\nbeen discredited, within the past few years there has been a revival\nof philosophical interest in the argument, and some contemporary\nphilosophers have attempted to rehabilitate a version of it. In\nRationality and Religious Theism, for instance, Joshua L.\nGolding adopts a broadly Pascalian strategy in defense of what he\ncalls “religious theism.” Whereas Pascal focused his\nattention on the question of whether it is rational to believe in\nGod, Golding is primarily concerned with the question of whether\nit is rational to pursue a religious way of life—one in\nwhich beliefs about God’s existence might play a relatively minor and\nnon-foundational role. To qualify as a religious theist, Golding\nexplains, one must seek to enter into a good relationship with God,\nand for this it is sufficient to believe simply that God’s existence\nis not impossible (i.e., that the concept of “God” is not\ncontradictory) and that it is at least slightly more likely that one\ncan achieve a good relationship with God by adopting a religious way\nof life than by not doing so. Arguing on the basis of the EVP, Golding\ncontends that it is rational to be a religious theist if one conceives\nof the value of a good relationship with God as “qualitatively\nsuperior” to any other value. \nWhereas Pascal held that the payoff of believing in God would be\ninfinite, if God exists, Golding is careful to insist that the value\nof a good relationship with God is finite. Otherwise, as he notes, we\nare faced with the problem—alluded to above—that more than\none path might be equally rational for a person in light of its\nexpected value. If, however, the value of a good relationship with God\nis finite, then whichever path is deemed to have the greatest chance\nof success at achieving this reward will have the highest expected\nvalue, other things being equal. Of course, the expected value of the\ngood relationship with God must be higher than the expected value of\nany non-religious pursuit, however likely the latter is to result in a\nmundane payoff. Thus, Golding holds that the value of a good\nrelationship with God should be understood “not merely as\n‘a lot better’ or ‘vastly better’ than any\nother goal,” but as qualitatively different. Given this\ndifference in kind, Golding concludes that “no quantitative\namount of other goods added together would equal the value” of\nthe good relationship with God (66). \nHowever, it is unclear whether Golding’s version of the\n“Wager” argument is ultimately more successful than\nPascal’s. The problem is that the EVP requires a single index of value\nin accordance with which gambles can be compared, whereas Golding’s\ncontention that the value of the good relationship with God is\ndifferent in kind from other values seems to suggest the\nincommensurability of two different indices. Thus, although the\nargument purports to show that religious theism is a more rational\nchoice, it seems ultimately to hinge not on an objective comparison of\ntwo commensurable quantities but on a preference for goods of a\ncertain type. It might well be the case that certain goods are\npreferable to others, even though there is no single scale of value by\nmeans of which to rank them, but showing this would seem to require a\ndifferent sort of argument than the one Golding presents. In other\nwords, Golding’s quantitative argument in favor of the\nreligious life over the non-religious life seems to be undercut by his\ninsistence that the outcomes being compared are qualitatively\ndifferent. \nIn any event, it is worth noting that Pascal and his intellectual\nheirs, though frequently characterized as fideists, are not\nantagonistic to reason tout court. In the first place, as\nPascal sees it, it is reasonable to acknowledge limits to\nreason. “Reason’s last step is the recognition that there are an\ninfinite number of things which are beyond it” (209). It is in\nthis spirit that he suggests, somewhat more elliptically, that\n“[t]here is nothing which is so much in conformity with reason\nas the rejection of reason” (209). Thus, Pascal invokes reason\nto justify what might otherwise appear to be its antithesis. Moreover,\nthe aim of the “Wager” argument is precisely to secure the\nrational respectability of faith in the face of an apparent antinomy.\nIn this respect, Pascal’s approach anticipates Kant’s contention that\nGod’s existence is a question for practical—as opposed\nto theoretical—reason. \nAny discussion of Søren Kierkegaard’s thought is complicated by\nthe fact that he wrote pseudonymously, attributing most of his\nwritings to a variety of fictional authors whose “views”\nmay or may not have corresponded to his own. In The Point of View\nfor My Work as an Author—one of the few works to which\nKierkegaard (1813–1855) was willing to append his own\nsignature—he explains his use of the pseudonyms by noting that\nphilosophical and religious confusion can be addressed only\nindirectly: “one must approach from behind the person who is\nunder an illusion” (1848, 24–25). He adds that the\nillusion against which his pseudonymous writings are directed is an\nillusion about what Christianity requires, and that these writings,\nthough employing philosophical tools, thus subserve a religious\nintent. According to this retrospective self-assessment, the whole of\nKierkegaard’s work “is related to Christianity, to the problem\n‘of becoming a Christian,’ with a direct or indirect\npolemic against the monstrous illusion we call Christendom, or against\nthe illusion that in such a land as ours all are Christians of a\nsort” (1848, 5–6).  \nAlthough it is a subject of debate whether to take at face value\nKierkegaard’s claim that his entire work serves a religious\nend—after all, it seems to be contradicted by other remarks of\nhis—it is nevertheless clear that combating confusion, including\nillusions about faith, was central to his\n work.[5]\n Kierkegaard suggests that speculative philosophy contributes to this\nconfusion by transforming Christianity into a sort of philosophical\ntheory or system. (Hegel is frequently—if not always entirely\nfairly—parodied in this connection.) In so doing, it imports\ninto religion modes of inquiry that distort the essential nature of\nfaith.  \nIt is perhaps tempting to imagine that the relation between evidence\nand belief is purely epistemological, a question of justification. On\nthis account, beliefs mean what they do irrespective of their relation\nto “the evidence”; what a consideration of the latter\nreveals is whether or not they are justified. But one of the\nimplications of Kierkegaard’s thought is that entitlement is a social\nstatus, and that the various social practices within which it is\nconferred or withheld contribute to the meaning of the beliefs in\nquestion. There are different kinds of beliefs, logically speaking,\nand different ways in which entitlement to such beliefs is vindicated.\nThe basic error to which philosophical systematizers are prone, he\nargues, is assuming that the criteria for evaluating a belief in one\ncontext are equally appropriate in other contexts. He writes,\n“in our own age everything is mixed together: the aesthetic is\ntreated ethically, faith is dealt with intellectually, and so forth.\nPhilosophy has answered every question; but no adequate consideration\nhas been given the question concerning what sphere it is within which\neach question finds its answer” (Anthology, 229). \nWithin the sphere of the “intellectual”—e.g., within\nscientific or historical scholarship—inquiry is conceived in\nterms of a process of “approximation” to reality. When it\ncomes to religion, however, what matters, according to Kierkegaard, is\nnot the “object to which the knower relates himself” but\nthe relationship itself: the accent falls not on “what is\nsaid” but on “how it is said” (1846, 199\nand 202). For Kierkegaard, as for the so-called evangelical fideists,\nfaith is characterized by passionate commitment and thus requires a\ndecision or “qualitative leap” (1846, 384). His\nclaim is not simply that having evidence is unnecessary in\nthis context, but that it would, so to speak, destroy the whole\nendeavor, since it would alter the meaning of the beliefs in\nquestion and the spirit in which they could be believed. “If I\nam able to apprehend God objectively, I do not have faith; but because\nI cannot do this, I must have faith. If I want to keep myself in\nfaith, I must continually see to it that I hold fast the objective\nuncertainty, see to it that in the objective uncertainty I am\n‘out on 70,000 fathoms of water’ and still have\nfaith” (1846, 204). Any belief that depended on the outcome of\nhistorical or scientific approximation—and which could be\nundermined by its results—would not be genuine faith, and\nanything whose existence could be established purely on the basis of\nphilosophical argument—and so could be believed in\n“indifferently,” without this belief making a significant\ndifference in one’s life—would by definition not be God.\n“Anyone who wants to demonstrate the existence of\nGod…proves something else instead, at times something that\nperhaps did not even need demonstrating, and in any case never\nanything better” (1844, 43). \nKierkegaard’s point is not that it is somehow permissible to neglect\none’s epistemic duties where belief in God is concerned, but that one\ncannot separate the question of “what” is believed from\nthe question of “how” it is believed. (For a contemporary\ndefense of this point, see Strandberg (2011), especially Chapters 1\nand 4.) Here the “how” refers to “the relationship\nsustained by the existing individual, in his own existence, to the\ncontent of his utterance” (Anthology, 214).\nReligion, for Kierkegaard, is a matter of what one does with one’s\nlife, a matter of “inwardness.” In this context, to\nobserve that religious believers lack evidence for their beliefs is\nnot to render a negative verdict on their entitlement but to comment\nconceptually on the kind of beliefs they are. \nWas Kierkegaard a fideist? Critics have argued that in recoiling from\nnatural theology, Kierkegaard transformed belief into a matter of will\nand emotion, and that a decision as monumental as a leap of\nfaith—made seemingly arbitrarily, in the absence of any rational\nassurance—might just as easily have disastrous results. J.L.\nMackie, for instance, claims that “what Kierkegaard himself is\nadvocating is a sort of intellectual Russian roulette” (216). So\nfar, it might be argued, Kierkegaard has done little to show that a\nleap in the direction of Christianity is a better bet than any of its\nalternatives, and that a wiser tack—as Hume counseled in\nconnection with alleged miracles—would be to proportion belief\n(and passion) to the available evidence. Kierkegaard’s defenders might\nreply that it is only from the “outside”—from the\npoint of view, e.g., of the dispassionate pseudonyms—that\nChristianity appears ungrounded and “absurd,” and that\nKierkegaard’s point is really that those already in possession of\nfaith need not be embarrassed by the fact that it is not the\nineluctable outcome of reasoning from an imagined set of neutral and\nuncontested premises. \nAlthough he relentlessly criticized what he perceived as the\noverweening ambitions of academic philosophy and an unwarranted\nreliance on foundationalist tendencies in theology, Kierkegaard held\nthat faith and reason are not mutually incompatible, and that\nphilosophy—when practiced with respect for the “conditions\nof existence” within which human beings necessarily do their\nthinking—can ultimately help to clarify the nature of Christian\ncommitment. For Kierkegaard, faith is incomprehensible, in\nthe sense that it demands a willingness to venture beyond the purview\nof philosophical reason, but it is not unreasonable or\nirrational. Thus, although he describes faith as\n“believing against the understanding,” he is careful to\ndistinguish the content of religious belief from mere\n“nonsense.” The believer “cannot believe nonsense\nagainst the understanding, which one might fear, because the\nunderstanding will penetratingly perceive that it is nonsense and\nhinder him in believing it”; however, the believer “uses\nthe understanding so much that through it he becomes aware of the\nincomprehensible”—i.e., of the logical limits of\nspeculative thought—“and now, believing, he relates\nhimself to it against the understanding” (1992, 568). By\ndiscriminating between those cases in which it is competent to judge\nand those in which it is not, philosophy thus plays a self-critical\nrole: mindful of its own limits, it allows religion to be itself. \nMackie’s contention that fideism is intellectually irresponsible was\nanticipated in the nineteenth century by W.K. Clifford, who famously\ndeclared that “[i]t is wrong always, everywhere, and for every\none, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence” (346). The\nAmerican pragmatist William James (1842–1910) called Clifford\n“that delicious enfant terrible,” and in his\nessay “The Will to Believe” he argued that Clifford had\noverstated the case against faith (8). In the paper, James delineates\na set of conditions under which, he argues, it can be reasonable to\nbelieve in the absence of proof. \nThese conditions are met whenever we are confronted by what James\nterms a “genuine option”—i.e., a choice between two\n(or more) “hypotheses” (or candidates for belief) which is\n“live,” “forced,” and\n“momentous”—and that option cannot be decided on\nintellectual grounds. An option is live (as opposed to dead) just in\ncase each of the hypotheses at issue is “among the mind’s\npossibilities” (2). Insofar as it depends upon an individual’s\nwillingness or ability to entertain it, a hypothesis’\n“liveliness” is an extrinsic, agent-specific property. By\ncontrast, an option is forced (rather than avoidable) just in case the\ncandidate hypotheses are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive of the\npossibilities. Finally, an option is momentous (as opposed to trivial)\njust in case the opportunity is unique, the stakes are significant, or\nthe decision is irreversible. \nJames points out that as people who hold beliefs, we generally have\ntwo goals: to avoid error, and to believe the truth. Though related,\nthese aims are in fact distinct: one can, for example, avoid error by\nsuspending belief. James argues that the scientific method is\noriented around the goal of avoiding error, but that in other aspects\nof life, the avoidance of error is\n inadequate.[6]\n For instance, in our relationships with others, we first have to\nbelieve that others will meet us half-way in order for this\nto be true. If we refused to interact with others until we had\n“sufficient evidence” of their willingness to reciprocate,\nwe would no doubt appear stand-offish and unapproachable, thus cutting\nourselves off altogether from the possibility of entering into\nmutually rewarding relationships. \nAccording to James, something similar is true in the case of religion.\nReligion, he says, teaches two things: (1) that “the best things\nare the more eternal things” and (2) that we are better off now\nif we believe (1) (25–26). These two assertions together\ncomprise what James refers to as the “religious\nhypothesis.” He contends that if the religious hypothesis is a\nlive hypothesis, the option with which it confronts us is\nnecessarily also a genuine option—i.e., it is momentous\nand forced. In cases like this, James contends, it is not enough\nsimply to avoid error; we also have to seek truth. “We cannot\nescape the issue by remaining sceptical and waiting for more light,\nbecause, although we do avoid error in that way if religion be\nuntrue, we lose the good, if it be true, just as\ncertainly as if we positively chose to disbelieve” (26). As in\nthe social example, the religious hypothesis must, as it were, be met\nhalf-way. \nJames acknowledges that choosing under such circumstances entails\nrisk—one might, after all, be wrong—but he denies that one\ncan avoid or reduce this risk by refusing to choose.\nSkepticism—i.e., the refusal to choose—is just as risky as\ncommitment. Furthermore, all such postures are inevitably—and,\nindeed, completely appropriately—shaped by one’s passions: not\ndeciding is just as much a matter of emotion as deciding, insofar as\nit is motivated by the fear of being wrong rather than the hope of\nbeing right. But, James contends, there is no rational basis for\npreferring fear over hope. \nLike Pascal, James insists that when it comes to religion, we cannot\navoid taking sides and incurring risks. James also agrees with Pascal\nthat faith can be rational in the absence of epistemic\njustification—at least in certain circumstances. However,\nJames’s argument differs from Pascal’s insofar as it purports to show,\nnot that religious belief is more rational, but only that in\nthe absence of definitive evidence it is not less rational,\nthan unbelief or agnosticism (at least with respect to those for whom\nthe religious hypothesis is live). \nAlthough he disagrees with Clifford about the justifiability of\nbelieving without conclusive proof, James appears to share Clifford’s\nview that—at least in certain cases—belief is subject to\nthe will (hence the title of his essay). In other words, James’s\nargument in “The Will to Believe,” like Pascal’s wager\nargument, seems to imply some version of doxastic voluntarism. But\ndepending on how this latter notion is understood, certain worries may\nhere arise. If belief is understood as a function of one’s total\nepistemic situation, rather than an independent judgment which that\nsituation might or might not warrant, then James’s analogy between\nbelieving and entering into a relationship appears problematic: only\nthe latter is subject to direct voluntary control. Of course,\nbelieving is subject to indirect voluntary control. In other\nwords, one can change one’s beliefs by changing one’s epistemic\ncircumstances; the latter, even if not the former, are susceptible to\ndirect control by the will. James himself acknowledges that, in the\nvast majority of cases, beliefs are not modifiable at will: “Can\nwe, by just willing it, believe that Abraham Lincoln’s existence is a\nmyth, and that the portraits of him in McClure’s Magazine are\nall of someone else? Can we, by any effort of our will, or by any\nstrength of wish that it were true, believe ourselves well and about\nwhen we are roaring with rheumatism in bed, or feel certain that the\nsum of the two one-dollar bills in our pocket must be a hundred\ndollars?” (4-5) James appears to take the position that it is\nonly with respect to live hypotheses that the will can play a\nrole. \nA related objection is that James does not appear to take account of\nthe possibility of “partial beliefs,” and that doing so\nundermines his notion of a forced option. If believing admits of\ndegrees, then choices of the kind James describes seem less stark.\nResponding to this kind of anticipated objection to his own work\n(described in Section 4 below), John Bishop has argued that a forced\nchoice is required whenever one is confronted by the rival\n“framing principles” of alternative doxastic practices.\n“One either ‘buys into’ the framework by commitment\nto its principles or one does not” (139). \nJames’s essay is intended as a “defence of our right to adopt a\nbelieving attitude in religious matters, in spite of the fact that our\nmerely logical intellect may not have been coerced” (1–2).\nSome critics have worried that the argument leads down a slippery\nslope to irrationalism. John Hick has claimed that James’s conclusion\n“constitutes an unrestriced license for wishful thinking…\nIf our aim is to believe what is true, and not necessarily what we\nlike, James’s universal permissiveness will not help us” (60).\nHowever, this seems unfair. James insists that in defending the\n“lawfulness of voluntarily adopted faith” he is not\nthereby opening the door to what he calls “patent\nsuperstition” (2, 29). Faith, on James’s account, is not a\nmatter of believing against the evidence; the “will to\nbelieve” is justified only when the option is genuine and the\nevidence is inconclusive. “In concreto,” James\nwrites, “the freedom to believe can only cover living options\nwhich the intellect of the individual cannot by itself resolve; and\nliving options never seem absurdities to him who has them to\nconsider” (29).  \nIt is important to appreciate that James is not claiming that\nit is morally permissible to believe something to which one is not\nepistemically entitled. Rather, he is claiming that there are beliefs\nto which one can be epistemically entitled even in the absence of\ndefinitive evidence—that, pace Clifford, entitlement is\nnot always a function of evidential support. Although James’s argument\nis often classified as a pragmatic argument for belief, he is not\noffering a prudential, as opposed to an epistemic,\njustification. Rather, he is comparing the relative merits of rival\nepistemic strategies (oriented respectively toward the goals of\navoiding error and believing truth). In this respect his argument\ndiffers importantly from Pascal’s “wager” arguments. It\ncan thus be argued that James is not disparaging reason in favor of\nfaith, but attempting rather to carve out a sphere for faith within\nwhat is rationally respectable. \nWidely regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth\ncentury, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) was also one of the\nmost controversial and difficult. Wittgenstein famously argued that\n“meaning is use”—that our words mean what they do by\nvirtue of the role they play in our discourse. Moreover, he argued\nthat words are used in more than one way, and that it is a mistake to\n“sublime the logic” of our language—i.e., to treat\nany single function of language as paradigmatic. “Think of the\ntools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver,\na rule, a glue-pot, nails and screws.—The functions of words are\nas diverse as the functions of these objects” (1958, I,\n§11). \nIn his later writings, Wittgenstein calls these diverse phenomena\nlanguage-games, in order, he explains, “to bring into\nprominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of\nan activity, or a form of life” (1958, I, §23). Renouncing\nhis own earlier quest for a general form of propositions, his later\nwritings suggest that these language-games “have no one thing in\ncommon which makes us use the same word for all,—but that they\nare related to one another in many different ways”\n(1958, I, §65). \nAlthough Wittgenstein was not by conventional standards\nreligious, his philosophical remarks and journal entries\nreveal what might be described as a religious sensibility and are\ninformed by a definite sympathy toward at least certain features of\nreligion. For Wittgenstein, as for Kierkegaard, whom he admired,\nreligion was less a matter of theory than of practice. “I\nbelieve that one of the things Christianity says is that sound\ndoctrines are all useless. They have to change your life. (Or\nthe direction of your life.)…Wisdom is passionless.\nBut faith by contrast is what Kierkegaard calls a\npassion” (1980, 53e). \nIt has been argued that Wittgenstein’s later thought, though perhaps\nnot overtly fideistic, nevertheless lends itself to fideistic\ninterpretation. According to this interpretation, religion is a\nself-contained and primarily expressive enterprise, governed by its\nown internal logic or “grammar.” This view—commonly\ncalled Wittgensteinian Fideism—is variously\ncharacterized as entailing one or more of the following distinct (but\narguably inter-related) theses: (1) that religion is logically cut off\nfrom other aspects of life; (2) that religious discourse is\nessentially self-referential and does not allow us to talk about\nreality; (3) that religious beliefs can be understood only by\nreligious believers; and (4) that religion cannot be\n criticized.[7] \nIt is highly doubtful, however, whether Wittgenstein would have\nendorsed any of these claims, let alone all four of them. Their\nattribution to Wittgenstein seems in fact to depend on a narrowly\nselective reading of what he actually said. As Richard Bell has\npointed out, \nIt is true that Wittgenstein cautioned against the tendency to assume\na unity of logical form behind the diversity of actual usage. He\nwrites, “Don’t say: ‘There must be something\ncommon…’—but look and see” (1958, I,\n§66). However, it is by no means clear that he intended to\nadvance any equally a priori thesis about the discontinuity\nand incommensurability of our discursive practices. \nIndeed, he suggests that the result of “looking” is that\n“we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and\ncriss-crossing” (1958, I, §66). A metaphor to which he\nreturns periodically is of language as an ancient city:\n“a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses,\nand of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded\nby a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and\nuniform houses” (1958, I, §18). Remarks such as these seem\nto militate against the balkanized view of language implied by\nWittgensteinian Fideism. \nIt also should be noted that the term “Wittgensteinian\nFideism” appeared after Wittgenstein’s death but prior to the\npublication in English of some of his most important writings on\nreligion, including Lectures on Religious Belief (1967),\nRemarks on Frazer’s Golden Bough (1979), and Culture and\nValue (1980) —i.e., at a time when Wittgenstein’s legacy\nwas particularly vulnerable to misinterpretation.  \nThe origins of the term “Wittgensteinian Fideism” derive\nfrom an essay of that name by Kai Nielsen, which appeared in the July\n1967 issue of Philosophy. There Nielsen suggested that\nWittgensteinian Fideism might in fact constitute a misrepresentation\nof Wittgenstein’s writings—not, interestingly enough, by his\ncritics, but by his followers—and that\n“Wittgenstein might well wish to say of Wittgensteinians what\nFreud said of Freudians” (194). Accordingly, Nielsen directed\nthe brunt of his critique not against Wittgenstein himself, but\nagainst Wittgensteinians like Norman Malcolm and Peter Winch. More\nrecently, the charge of Wittgensteinian Fideism has become associated\nespecially with the work of the philosopher of religion D.Z.\nPhillips. \nAlthough it is impossible here to explore these allegations in any\ndetail, it is worth noting that Wittgensteinians generally regard\n“Wittgensteinian Fideism” as a caricature not only of\nWittgenstein’s views but also of their own. In defending himself and\nother Wittgensteinian philosophers of religion against the charge of\nfideism, Phillips writes: \nIn the last decade of his life, Phillips in fact devoted considerable\nattention to what, following his teacher Rush Rhees, he called the\nunity—i.e., the interlocking intelligibility—of\ndiscourse. He argued that religious beliefs depend for their sense and\nimportance on non-religious features of human existence, but that the\nrelation between the former and the latter is not generally the\nrelation between conclusions and their justification. \nPhillips’s longstanding debate with Nielsen is commonly portrayed as a\nmodern-day contest between faith and reason, but Phillips never\nregarded it that way himself. Whereas Nielsen treats Phillips’s\n“contemplative” approach to philosophy of religion as\nessentially an apologetic strategy meant to shield belief in God from\ncriticism, Phillips contended that “it casts a liberating light\non both belief and atheism. Both are rescued from\nphilosophical distortion” (2005, 75). As Phillips saw it, his\ndisagreement with Nielsen was a disagreement not between the advocates\nof competing first-order commitments, but between Nielsen’s atheism\nand his own professed desire to do conceptual justice to rival points\nof view, both religious and anti-religious—an asymmetry that the\nterm “fideism,” with its pietistic connotations, seemed to\nhim to obscure. \nOne lesson to be gleaned from the preceding cases is that\n“fideism” is a term that is seldom self-applied. This is\nno doubt largely because it has come to function primarily as a term\nof abuse as opposed to a genuinely descriptive term. In this respect,\nits de facto role is similar to that played by terms like\n“relativism” and, perhaps, “anti-realism.”\nSuch labels generally say at least as much about the philosophical\ncommitments of those who use them as they do about the positions to\nwhich they are applied. \nPopkin argues that the skepticism introduced into theology in the\nsixteenth century eventually led to the atheism and irreligious\n“free-thinking” of the Enlightenment. After all, Hume says\nessentially the same thing as the so-called fideists when he writes\nthat “[o]ur most holy religion is founded on faith, not\non reason” (140), except that by the eighteenth century this had\nbeen transformed into an implicit—if\nnot-so-subtle—reproach. Thus, Hume proceeds to add that\nsince “[m]ere reason is insufficient to convince us of its\nveracity…whoever is moved by faith to assent to\n[Christianity] is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person\nwhich subverts all the principles of his understanding and gives him a\ndetermination to believe what is most contrary to custom and\nexperience” (141). The sarcasm here is hard to miss. \nHence, by the time the term “fideism” entered the\nphilosophical vocabulary, the position it denoted was already highly\nsuspect. In an Age of Reason, faith-ism is inevitably going\nto sound irrational. However, the conception of reason which\nthe putative fideist is accused of transgressing is almost invariably\none the latter would reject as insufficiently robust. Thus, the\nopposition to reason said to characterize fideism is perhaps better\nconceived as a rejection of a particular account of\nreason—one the so-called fideist regards as overly narrow and\nrestrictive—or of the applicability to religion of a particular\nway of reasoning. To be sure, the thinkers described as\n“fideists” have sometimes expressed their objections in\nways that contribute to the impression of irrationalism. Looked at\nfrom this point of view, however, it is the critic of fideism who\nfails to appreciate the irony with which the putative fideist uses the\nterm “reason.” In effect, the putative fideist can\ngenerally more charitably be interpreted as claiming that it can be\nrational to refuse to subject certain of one’s beliefs to\nwhat is popularly (though misleadingly, from the point of view of the\nputative fideist) called “reason”— reason, so to\nspeak, in “scare quotes.” \nTo generalize, what the thinkers labeled “fideists” have\ntended to find objectionable is not reason per se, but\nevidentialism—i.e., the doctrine (expressed forcefully\nby Clifford) that beliefs can be rational only if they are supported\nby evidence. Since evidentialism might otherwise seem to give rise to\na regress problem, it is generally conjoined with some version of\nfoundationalism which purports to delineate a criterion of\n“proper basicality”—i.e., a set of conditions under\nwhich beliefs can rationally be held without further evidential\nsupport. Whereas some putative fideists—like Pascal—argue\nthat religious beliefs can be given non-evidential support, others can\nbe interpreted as suggesting that such beliefs are themselves properly\nbasic, or (as Plantinga has argued more recently) that no criterion of\nproper basicality that would exclude religious beliefs can itself be\nshown to be justified. Their contention in either case is that the\nbeliever can be rationally justified—or at least cannot be shown\nto be behaving irrationally—in holding certain beliefs,\neven if these beliefs themselves are not supported by evidence.\nConceived of in this way, the putative fideist’s position—though\nnot uncontroversial—is hardly the brazenly paradoxical doctrine\nit might at first appear to be. \nIn recent years, a small number of philosophers of religion has\nembraced the term fideism and sought to reclaim its\nnon-pejorative use. These thinkers are rare among philosophers in\ntheir willingness to take up a gauntlet that is usually\nrefused—even by those with views in many respects similar to\ntheir own.  \nOne of the most carefully argued contemporary defenses of fideism is\nC. Stephen Evans’s book Faith Beyond Reason. Evans attempts\nto rehabilitate—or perhaps habilitate—the term by\ndistinguishing “responsible” forms of fideism from various\nirrationalistic alternatives. Whereas the latter pit faith directly\nagainst reason, the former contend that faith can\nappropriately take over where reason leaves matters of ultimate\nconcern unresolved. Drawing on Kierkegaard’s thought, Evans contends\nthat while there are limits to reason, they are limits which it is\nreasonable for reason to acknowledge. \nLike the Protestant Reformers, Evans suggests that the customary\nexercise of human reason is limited not merely by finitude but also by\npride and self-centeredness. For this reason, faith and reason can\nfind themselves in tension. For Evans, however, “faith is\nagainst reason only in the sense that it runs into conflict with a\nconcrete form of reason that is damaged” (153). Moreover, Evans\ninsists that the defects in reason—though substantial—are\nnevertheless not such as to render us completely oblivious to them.\nThus, he does not reject reason altogether. In his preferred\nterminology, faith is not so much against as beyond\nreason, since it is ultimately compatible, in his view, with a duly\nself-critical intellect. \nAnother recent defense of fideism can be found in John Bishop’s book\nBelieving by Faith: An Essay in the Epistemology and Ethics of\nReligious Belief. Where Evans draws on Kierkegaard, Bishop builds\non James’s argument in “The Will to Believe” to develop\nwhat he terms a “modest, moral coherentist,\n‘supra-evidential’ fideism” (3).  \nA crucial premise in Bishop’s argument is what he terms the\n“thesis of evidential ambiguity,” which holds that, under\n“rational empiricist evidential practice,” our overall\nexperience of the world is equally plausibly interpreted on either a\ntheistic or an atheistic reading, thereby leaving open the question of\nGod’s existence (70–1). He argues that under appropriate\nconditions—essentially those comprising what James called a\n“genuine option,” together with evidential indeterminacy,\non the one hand, and the satisfaction of certain moral constraints on\none’s passional motivations and the content of one’s faith-commitment,\non the other—it is morally permissible to make a “doxastic\nfaith-venture”—that is, to take belief in God to be true\nin one’s practical reasoning, while recognizing that it is not\ncertified by one’s total available evidence (147). The brand of\nfideism for which Bishop argues is thus ‘supra-evidential’\nin the sense that it defends the permissibility of reasoning on the\nbasis of commitments that outrun what is warranted on purely\nevidential grounds. Like Evans, and in keeping with James and Pascal,\nhowever, Bishop is careful to distinguish supra-evidential fideism\nfrom counter-evidential fideism: unlike the latter, the former, he\nargues, cannot be shown to violate any epistemic obligations.\nAlthough, unlike some putative fideists, Bishop does not regard\nevidentialism as incoherent or epistemically irresponsible, he argues\nthat fideism of the kind he defends is preferable on broadly moral\ngrounds, suggesting, for instance, that fideism’s tolerance for\npassional commitments conduces to a more balanced acceptance of human\nnature as more than purely rational (216–220). \nOne difference between these two contemporary versions of fideism is\nthat Evans focuses primarily on what is permissible in an epistemic\nsense, whereas Bishop begins with the ethics of fideistic\nbelief, by considering the justifiability in moral terms of taking\nreligious beliefs to be true in one’s practical reasoning. Unlike\nholding beliefs to be true, taking them to be true\nin practical reasoning, Bishop argues, is subject to direct voluntary\ncontrol and an appropriate subject for moral evaluation. Yet, insofar\nas such faith-ventures are not counter-evidential, he argues, they\ncarry epistemic entitlement too. \nAnother difference is that Evans regards faith as justifiable in light\nof inherent limits to human rationality as such, whereas on Bishop’s\naccount, evidential ambiguity is a feature of the world viewed\nrelative to what he calls “our rational empiricist evidential\npractice.” The latter qualification seems to leave room for\nother practices to which ambiguity about God’s existence might be\nforeign. Bishop raises this possibility in a discussion of\n“isolationist” epistemologies (such as Wittgensteinian\nFideism, if such a thing exists), which attempt to segregate questions\nof evidential support for religious claims from the standards of a\n“wider, generally prevailing, evidential practice” (79).\nFrom within what the isolationist regards as the appropriate practice,\nthe “evidence” may seem to point incontrovertibly toward,\ne.g., theistic conclusions (or certain propositions about God may\ncount as basic). However, Bishop contends that insofar as questions\nmay still arise for the reflective believer about the justifiability\nof commitment to the framework principles of the theistic\ndoxastic practice, isolationism cannot avoid the need for doxastic\nventures that outrun the available evidence. Some version of fideism\nthus seems unavoidable for the reflective believer. But granting, for\nthe sake of the argument, that Bishop is right about the options\navailable to the contemporary reflective believer, it might\nnevertheless be argued that a very different situation obtained prior\nto the development of rational empiricist evidential practice (and\nperhaps continues to obtain where that practice has not taken root).\nArguably for premodern thinkers there was no question of\n“isolating” belief in God from any “wider, generally\nprevailing, evidential practice,” and thus no existential\n“choice” to be made about which standards to employ. If\nthis is right, it provides additional support for the claim that it is\nanachronistic to describe someone like Tertullian as a fideist. Put\ndifferently, starting from the thesis of evidential ambiguity allows\nfor the historicizing of fideism, in a way that encourages us to view\nthe possibility to which the descriptive use of the term refers as\ncontingent on particular historical developments, rather than as\nperennially available—i.e., as a distinctively modern response\nto a distinctively modern problem. \nWhere Bishop and Evans agree is that some version of fideism\nis justifiable—on moral and/or rational grounds—even if\nwhat is believed by faith itself requires no external\nevidential support. Their quarrel is thus not with reason tout\ncourt, but with certain philosophical assumptions about belief\nentitlement. \nAs we saw above, Evans and Bishop seek to rehabilitate fideism by\nidentifying spaces inaccessible to (some form of) reason: faith is\nwarrantable where reason reaches its limit. But suppose there is no\nsuch limit. This is the counter-fideistic suggestion made by the\ncontemporary French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux, who seeks to\nundercut religious theism by denying it a conceptual sphere of its\nown. If there is no distinction to be made between faith and reason\nthat would constitute a limit to the latter, then philosophy need not\nyield to religious claims to extra-rational revelation. \nAccording to Meillassoux, the attractions of fideism can be traced to\nwhat he takes to be a basic dogma of philosophical thought since Kant,\nwhich he calls correlationism. According to correlationism,\nthinking and being go hand in hand, such that there can be no\nconception of the world independent of human experience: things in\nthemselves are thus unknowable (and on a strong reading unthinkable).\nCorrelationists embrace finitude as part of the human condition; it is\nwithin this finitude that post-metaphysical thought, including\nphenomenology and analytic philosophy, operates. So understood,\nphilosophy seeks to describe what is given in experience, but\nit can furnish these facts with no ultimate ground or necessity.\nAccording to post-metaphysical philosophy, the principle of sufficient\nreason—whatever its utility in the phenomenal world—is\nthus circumscribed within a more fundamental abyss of contingency. \nMeillassoux argues that this drawing of a boundary to reason within\npost-metaphysical philosophy is what authorizes fideistic\nreligion: Accordingly, facticity entails a specific and rather remarkable\nconsequence: it becomes rationally illegitimate to disqualify\nirrational discourses about the absolute on the pretext of their\nirrationality. From the perspective of the strong model, in effect,\nreligious belief has every right to maintain that the world was\ncreated out of nothingness from an act of love, or that God’s\nomnipotence allows him to dissolve the apparent contradition between\nhis complete identity and His difference with his Son. These\ndiscourses continue to be meaningful—in a mythological or\nmystical register—even though they are scientifically and\nlogically meaningless (41). \nFar from abolishing the value of the absolute, the process that\ncontinues to be referred to today as “the end of\nabsolutes” grants the latter an unprecedented\nlicence—philosophers seem to ask only one thing of these\nabsolutes: that they be devoid of the slightest pretensions to\nrationality. The end of metaphysics, understood as the\n“de-absolutization of thought,” is thereby seen to consist\nin the rational legitimation of any and every variety of religious (or\n“poetico-religious”) belief in the absolute, so long as\nthe latter invokes no authority beside itself. To put it in other\nwords: by forbidding reason any claim to the absolute, the end of\nmetaphysics has taken the form of an exacerbated return of the\nreligious (45). \nMeillassoux concludes that, insofar as it cedes the absolute—the\ndomain once claimed by metaphysics—to religion, strong\ncorrelationsim is “merely the other name” for\nfideism (48). \nFor his part, Meillassoux advocates not a return to pre-critical\nmetaphysics, but a critique of Critique, which would re-open\nphilosophical access to what he calls the “great\noutdoors”—i.e., Kant’s “thing in itself” or,\nto put it in Meillassoux’s terms, the “thing without me.”\nWhile conceding that sensory concepts imply a human relation to the\nworld, Meillassoux argues that mathematics offers privileged access to\n“primary qualities,” thus breaking philosophy out of\ncorrelationism. Rather than simply describing what is given in\nexperience, speculative philosophy can venture alongside the physical\nsciences into an account of the world before human beings existed,\nwhich Meillassoux calls “ancestrality.” \nThe ensuing account is one in which Meillassoux rejects any idea of\nnecessary being, whether religious or metaphysical. Where\ncorrelationism attributes the apparent absence of any sufficient\n(metaphysical) reason for the existence of things to an\nepistemological limit, Meillassoux argues that it points to something\nontological: \nThe only absolute, on this understanding, is the principle of\nunreason – i.e., the necessity of contingency. \nInstead of retiring the concept of God, however, Meillassoux wants to\nclaim it for philosophy: what takes the place of revealed religion, on\nthis account, is not straightforwardly atheism, but the God of the\nphilosophers. God’s inexistence belongs, Meillassoux argues, to the\ngeneral contingency he takes to be the condition of all being. Put the\nother way around, this means that it is necessarily the case that\nGod’s existence is possible (Watkin, 149). On Christopher Watkin’s\nreading, “Meillassoux comes tantalisingly close here to implying\nthat the only way to be rid of God is rationally to prove his\nexistence, but we shall have to wait a little while longer for his\nconclusion on the existence of God” (137). \nGiven its contrarian approach to nearly the whole of modern\nphilosophy, Meillassoux’s thought is at least as controversial as the\n“fideism” it challenges, and its plausibility depends on\none’s position on a host of fundamental issues which it is beyond the\nscope of this article to discuss. (For useful critical discussions of\nMeillassoux’s thought, see Sparrow and Watkin.) In this respect, it\nhelps to show how the question of fideism, far from being a peripheral\nissue in the philosophy of religion, leads directly into the very\ndeepest questions of modern metaphysics and epistemology.","contact.mail":"richard.amesbury@asu.edu","contact.domain":"asu.edu"}]
