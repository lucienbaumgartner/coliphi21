Its definition is thus to some extent one of historical\nconvenience. The term was explicitly adopted as a self-description by\nJean-Paul Sartre, and through the wide dissemination of the postwar\nliterary and philosophical output of Sartre and his\nassociates—notably Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty,\nand Albert Camus—existentialism became identified with a\ncultural movement that flourished in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s.\nAmong the major philosophers identified as existentialists (many of\nwhom—for instance Camus and Heidegger—repudiated the\nlabel) were Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and Martin Buber in\nGermany, Jean Wahl and Gabriel Marcel in France, the Spaniards\nJosé Ortega y Gasset and Miguel de Unamuno, and the Russians\nNikolai Berdyaev and Lev Shestov. The nineteenth century philosophers,\nSøren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, came to be seen as\nprecursors of the movement. Existentialism was as much a literary\nphenomenon as a philosophical one. Sartre’s own ideas were and\nare better known through his fictional works (such as Nausea\nand No Exit) than through his more purely philosophical ones\n(such as Being and Nothingness and Critique of\nDialectical Reason), and the postwar years found a very diverse\ncoterie of writers and artists linked under the term: retrospectively,\nDostoevsky, Ibsen, and Kafka were conscripted; in Paris there were\nJean Genet, André Gide, André Malraux, and the\nexpatriate Samuel Beckett; the Norwegian Knut Hamsun and the Romanian\nEugene Ionesco belong to the club; artists such as Alberto Giacometti\nand even Abstract Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Arshile\nGorky, and Willem de Kooning, and filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard\nand Ingmar Bergman were understood in existential terms. By the mid\n1970s the cultural image of existentialism had become a cliché,\nparodized in countless books and films by Woody\n Allen.[1]\n\n\nIt is sometimes suggested, therefore, that existentialism just is this\nbygone cultural movement rather than an identifiable philosophical\nposition; or, alternatively, that the term should be restricted to\nSartre’s philosophy\n alone.[2]\n Two recent books, both of them sustained\nattempts to engage critically and constructively with existentialism\nin the context of contemporary philosophical debates, adopt versions\nof these stances.  Jonathan Webber argues that “as originally\ndefined by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, existentialism is\nthe ethical theory that we ought to treat the freedom at the core of\nhuman existence as intrinsically valuable and the foundation of all\nother values” (2018: 2). If we stick to this definition, we can\nboth recognize the fissures within what is called\n“existentialism” in the expansive sense and also see how\nexistentialism can “ground sophisticated contributions to social\npsychology, philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, cultural theory, and\npsychotherapy” (2018: 19). Taking up the other stance, Noreen\nKhawaja notes the perennial difficulty in specifying just who is\nsupposed to belong to the “movement” of existentialism,\ngiven that the term itself was either unknown to some who are\nconscripted or outright rejected by others. But, she argues, this is a\nproblem only if existentialism is taken to be a movement. Though\naspects of such a movement can be found in the historical record,\nexistentialism itself “is a tradition, not a movement”;\nthat is, “a pattern of intergenerational influence, in which\nlater figures read and appropriated the work of earlier figures”\n(Khawaja 2016: 4). What animates this tradition—exemplified here\nby Kierkegaard, Heidegger, and Sartre—is its struggle with\nreligion and the fact that the writing of even so-called\n“atheist” existentialists “feels religious\nto its readers” (2016: 16). Interestingly, taking either stance\nleads to the same place: For Khawaja, “the idea of personal\nauthenticity [is] at the center of existential thought” (2016:\n24), while for Webber, the existentialism of Sartre, Beauvoir, and\nFranz Fanon begins with “eudaimonist arguments for the virtue of\nauthenticity” and finally affirms “a categorial moral\nimperative of authenticity” (2018: 19).\n\n\nIn this entry, I will employ elements of both approaches. Like\nKhawaja, I take existentialism to be a usefully broad term of\nintellectual history that can illuminate the work of philosophers and\nothers who preceded the rise of the “movement” or rejected\nthe label. In this sense, “existentialism” picks out a\ndistinctive cluster of philosophical problems and a relatively\ndistinct current of twentieth- and now twenty-first-century\nphilosophical inquiry, one that has had significant impact on fields\nsuch as theology (through Rudolf Bultmann, Paul Tillich, Karl Barth,\nand others) and psychology (from Ludwig Binswanger and Medard Boss to\nOtto Rank, R. D. Laing, and Viktor Frankl). On the other hand, I do\nnot think that the “tradition” of existential thought\nshould be approached exclusively in terms of the (very real) struggle\nwith religion that gives some of the works of existential philosophy a\nreligious “feel” (but see Westphal 2012). I agree with\nWebber that there is a core of philosophical (categorial) content to\nexistential thought that can be understood independently of the sort\nof religious “rhetoric” (Khawaja 2016: 16) characteristic\nof many of the classics of existentialism. Unlike Webber, however, I\nthink that this categorial content is quite widely shared—beyond\nSartre, Beauvoir, and Fanon—and must be understood as grounded\nin the phenomenological approach that so excited Sartre (see\nCrowell 2012b). The phenomenological approach gave philosophical shape\nto the basic existential insight that thinking about human\nexistence requires new categories not found in the conceptual\nrepertoire of ancient or modern thought; human beings can be\nunderstood neither as substances with fixed properties, nor as\nsubjects interacting with a world of objects.\n\n\nOn the existential view, to understand what a human being is it is not\nenough to know all the truths that natural science—including the\nscience of psychology—could tell us. The dualist who holds that\nhuman beings are composed of independent\nsubstances—“mind” and “body”—is no\nbetter off in this regard than is the physicalist who holds that\nhuman existence can be adequately explained in terms of the\nfundamental physical constituents of the universe. Existentialism does\nnot deny the validity of the basic categories of physics, biology,\npsychology, and the other sciences (categories such as matter,\ncausality, force, function, organism, development, motivation, and so\non). It claims only that human beings cannot be fully understood in\nterms of them. Nor can such an understanding be gained by\nsupplementing our scientific picture with a moral one.\nCategories of moral theory such as intention, blame, responsibility,\ncharacter, duty, virtue, and the like do capture important\naspects of the human condition, but neither moral thinking (governed\nby the norms of the good and the right) nor scientific thinking\n(governed by the norm of truth) suffices. \n\n\n“Existentialism”, therefore, may be defined as the\nphilosophical theory which holds that a further set of categories,\ngoverned by the norm of authenticity, is necessary to grasp\nhuman existence. To approach existentialism in this categorial way may\nseem to conceal what is often taken to be its “heart”\n(Kaufmann 1968: 12), namely, its character as a gesture of protest\nagainst academic philosophy, its anti-system sensibility, its flight\nfrom the “iron cage” of reason. But while it is true that\nthe major existential philosophers wrote with a passion and urgency\nrather uncommon in our own time, and while the idea that philosophy\ncannot be practiced in the disinterested manner of an objective\nscience is indeed central to existentialism, it is equally true that\nall the themes popularly associated with existentialism—dread,\nboredom, alienation, the absurd, freedom, commitment, nothingness, and\nso on—find their philosophical significance in the context of\nthe search for a new categorial framework, together with its governing\nnorm.\n\nSartre’s existentialism drew its immediate inspiration from the\nwork of the German philosopher, Martin Heidegger. Heidegger’s\n1927 Being and Time, an inquiry into the “being that we\nourselves are” (which he termed “Dasein,” a German\nword for existence), introduced most of the motifs that would\ncharacterize later existentialist thinking: the tension between the\nindividual and the “public”; an emphasis on the worldly or\n“situated” character of human thought and reason; a\nfascination with liminal experiences of anxiety, death, the\n“nothing” and nihilism; the rejection of science (and\nabove all, causal explanation) as an adequate framework for\nunderstanding human being; and the introduction of\n“authenticity” as the norm of self-identity, tied to the\nproject of self-definition through freedom, choice, and commitment.\nThough in 1946 Heidegger would repudiate the retrospective labelling\nof his earlier work as existentialism, it is in that work that the\nrelevant concept of existence finds its first systematic\nphilosophical\n formulation.[3] \nAs Sartre and Merleau-Ponty would later do, Heidegger pursued these\nissues with the somewhat unlikely resources of Edmund Husserl’s\nphenomenological method. And while not all existential philosophers\nwere influenced by phenomenology (for instance Jaspers and Marcel),\nthe philosophical legacy of existentialism is largely tied to the form\nit took as an existential version of phenomenology. Husserl’s\nefforts in the first decades of the twentieth century had been\ndirected toward establishing a descriptive science of consciousness,\nby which he understood not the object of the natural science of\npsychology but the “transcendental” field of\nintentionality, i.e., that whereby our experience is\nmeaningful, an experience of something as something.\nThe existentialists welcomed Husserl’s doctrine of\nintentionality as a refutation of the Cartesian view according to\nwhich consciousness relates immediately only to its own\nrepresentations, ideas, sensations. According to Husserl,\nconsciousness is our direct openness to the world, one that is\ngoverned categorially (normatively) rather than causally; that is,\nintentionality is not a property of the individual mind but the\ncategorial framework in which mind and world become\n intelligible.[4] \nA phenomenology of consciousness, then, explores neither the\nmetaphysical composition nor the causal genesis of things, but the\n“constitution” of their meaning. Husserl employed this\nmethod to clarify our experience of nature, the socio-cultural world,\nlogic, and mathematics, but Heidegger argued that he had failed to\nraise the most fundamental question, that of the “meaning of\nbeing” as such. In turning phenomenology toward the question of\nwhat it means to be, Heidegger insists that the question be raised\nconcretely: it is not at first some academic exercise but a\nburning concern arising from life itself: the question of what it\nmeans for me to be. Existential themes take on salience when\none sees that the general question of the meaning of being involves\nfirst becoming clear about one’s own being as an inquirer.\nAccording to Heidegger, the categories bequeathed by the philosophical\ntradition for understanding a being who can question his or\nher being are insufficient: traditional concepts of a substance decked\nout with reason, or of a subject blessed with self-consciousness,\nmisconstrue our fundamental character, \n“being-in-the-world.” In his phenomenological pursuit of\nthe categories that govern being-in-the-world, Heidegger became the\nreluctant father of existentialism because he drew inspiration from\ntwo seminal, though in academic circles then relatively unknown,\nnineteenth-century writers, Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich\nNietzsche. One can find anticipations of existential thought in many\nplaces (for instance, in Socratic irony, Augustine, Pascal, or the\nlate Schelling), but the roots of the problem of existence in its\ncontemporary significance lie in the work of Kierkegaard and\nNietzsche. \nKierkegaard developed this problem in the context of his radical\napproach to Christian faith; Nietzsche did so in light of his thesis\nof the death of God. Subsequent existential thought reflects this\ndifference: while some writers—such as Sartre and\nBeauvoir—were resolutely atheist in outlook, others—such\nas Heidegger, Jaspers, Marcel, and Buber—variously explored the\nimplications of the concept “authentic existence” for\nreligious consciousness. Though neither Nietzsche’s nor\nKierkegaard’s thought can be reduced to a single strand, both\ntook an interest in what Kierkegaard termed “the single\nindividual.” Both were convinced that this singularity, what is\nmost my own, “me,” could be meaningfully reflected upon\nwhile yet, precisely because of its singularity, remain invisible to\ntraditional philosophy, with its emphasis either on what follows\nunerring objective laws of nature or else conforms to the universal\nstandards of moral reason. A focus on existence thus led, in both, to\nunique textual strategies quite alien to the philosophy of their\ntime. \nIn Kierkegaard, the singularity of existence comes to light at the\nmoment of conflict between ethics and religious faith. Suppose it is\nmy sense of doing God’s will that makes my life meaningful. How\ndoes philosophy conceive this meaning? Drawing here on Hegel as\nemblematic of the entire tradition, Kierkegaard, in his book Fear\nand Trembling, argues that for philosophy my life becomes\nmeaningful when I “raise myself to the universal” by\nbringing my immediate (natural) desires and inclinations under the\nmoral law, which represents my “telos” or what I\nought to be. In doing so I lose my singularity\n(since the law holds for all) but my actions become meaningful in the\nsense of understandable, governed by a norm. Now a person whose sense\nof doing God’s will is what gives her life meaning will be\nintelligible just to the extent that her action conforms to the\nuniversal dictates of ethics. But what if, as in case of\nAbraham’s sacrifice of his son, the action contradicts what\nethics demands?\n Kierkegaard[5]\n believes both that Abraham’s life is supremely\nmeaningful (it is not simply a matter of some immediate desire or\nmeaningless tic that overcomes Abraham’s ethical consciousness;\non the contrary, doing the moral thing is itself in this case\nhis tempting inclination) and that philosophy cannot\nunderstand it, thus condemning it in the name of ethics. God’s\ncommand here cannot be seen as a law that would pertain to all; it\naddresses Abraham in his singularity. If Abraham’s life is\nmeaningful, it represents, from a philosophical point of view, the\n“paradox” that through faith the “single individual\nis higher than the universal.” Existence as a philosophical\nproblem appears at this point: if there is a dimension to my being\nthat is both meaningful and yet not governed by the rational standard\nof morality, by what standard is it governed? For unless\nthere is some standard, it is idle to speak of\n“meaning.” \nTo solve this problem there must be a norm inherent in singularity\nitself, and, in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript,\nKierkegaard tries to express such a norm in his claim that\n“subjectivity is the truth,” an idea that prefigures the\nexistential concept of authenticity. Abraham has no objective reason\nto think that the command he hears comes from God; indeed, based on\nthe content of the command he has every reason, as Kant pointed out in\nReligion Within the Limits of Reason Alone, to think that it\ncannot come from God. His sole justification is what\nKierkegaard calls the passion of faith. Such faith is,\nrationally speaking, absurd, a “leap,” so if there is to\nbe any talk of truth here, it is a standard that measures not the\ncontent of Abraham’s act but the way in which he\naccomplishes it. To perform the movement of faith\n“subjectively” is to embrace the paradox as normative for\nme, in spite of its absurdity, rather than to seek an escape from it by\nmeans of objective textual exegesis, historical criticism, or some\nother strategy for translating the singularity of my situation into\nthe universal. Because my reason cannot help here, the normative\nappropriation is a function of my “inwardness” or passion.\nIn this way I “truly” become what I nominally already am.\nTo say that subjectivity is the truth is to highlight a way of being,\nthen, and not a mode of knowing; truth measures the attitude\n(“passion”) with which I appropriate, or make my own, an\n“objective uncertainty” (the voice of God) in a\n“process of highest inwardness.” \nIn contrast to the singularity of this movement, for Kierkegaard,\nstands the crowd: “the crowd is untruth.” The crowd is,\nroughly, public opinion in the widest sense—the ideas that a\ngiven age takes for granted; the ordinary and accepted way of doing\nthings; the complacent attitude that comes from the conformity\nnecessary for social life—and what condemns it to\n“untruth” in Kierkegaard’s eyes is the way that it\ninsinuates itself into an individual’s own sense of who she is,\nrelieving her of the burden of being herself: if everyone is a\nChristian, there is no need for me to “become” one. Since\nit is a measure not of knowing but of being, one can see how\nKierkegaard answers those who object that his concept of subjectivity\nas truth is based on an equivocation: the objective truths of science\nand history, however well-established, are in themselves matters of\nindifference; they belong to the crowd. It is not insofar as\ntruth can be established objectively that it takes on meaning, but\nrather insofar as it is appropriated “passionately” in its\nvery uncertainty. To “exist” is always to be confronted\nwith this question of meaning. The truths that matter to who one is\ncannot, like Descartes’ morale definitif, be something\nto be attained only when objective science has completed its task. \nFor Kierkegaard, existence emerges as a philosophical problem in the\nstruggle to think the paradoxical presence of God; for Nietzsche it is\nfound in the reverberations of the phrase “God is dead,”\nin the challenge of nihilism. \nResponding in part to the cultural situation in nineteenth-century\nEurope—historical scholarship continuing to erode fundamentalist\nreadings of the Bible, the growing cultural capital of the natural\nsciences, and Darwinism in particular—and in part driven by his\nown investigations into the psychology and history of moral concepts,\nNietzsche sought to draw the consequences of the death of God, the\ncollapse of any theistic support for morality. Like his contemporary,\nFyodor Dostoevsky, whose character, Ivan, in The Brothers\nKaramazov, famously argues that if God does not exist then\neverything is permitted, Nietzsche’s overriding concern is to\nfind a way to take the measure of human life in the modern world.\nUnlike Dostoevsky, however, Nietzsche sees a complicity between\nmorality and the Christian God that perpetuates a life-denying, and so\nultimately nihilistic, stance. Nietzsche was not the first to\nde-couple morality from its divine sanction; psychological theories of\nthe moral sentiments, developed since the eighteenth century, provided\na purely human account of moral normativity. But while these earlier\ntheories had been offered as justifications of the normative\nforce of morality, Nietzsche’s idea that behind moral\nprescriptions lies nothing but “will to power” undermined\nthat authority. On the account given in On the Genealogy of\nMorals, the Judeo-Christian moral order arose as an expression of\nthe ressentiment of the weak against the power exercised over\nthem by the strong. A tool used to thwart that power, it had over time\nbecome internalized in the form of conscience, creating a\n“sick” animal whose will is at war with its own vital\ninstincts. Thus Nietzsche arrived at Kierkegaard’s idea that\n“the crowd is untruth”: the so-called autonomous,\nself-legislating individual is nothing but a herd animal that has\ntrained itself to docility and unfreedom by conforming to the\n“universal” standards of morality. The normative is\nnothing but the normal. \nYet this is not the end of the story for Nietzsche, any more than it\nwas for Kierkegaard. If the autonomous individual has so far signified\nnothing but herd mentality—if moral norms arose precisely to\nproduce such conformists—the individual nevertheless has the\npotential to become something else; the sick animal is “pregnant\nwith a future.” Nietzsche saw that in the nineteenth century the\n“highest values” had begun to “devalue\nthemselves.” For instance, the Christian value of truth-telling,\ninstitutionalized in the form of science, had undermined the belief in\nGod, disenchanting the world and excluding from it any pre-given moral\nmeaning. In such a situation the individual is forced back upon\nhimself. On the one hand, if he is weakly constituted he may fall\nvictim to despair in the face of nihilism, the recognition that life\nhas no intrinsic meaning. On the other hand, for a\n“strong” or creative individual nihilism presents a\nliberating opportunity to take responsibility for meaning, to exercise\ncreativity by “transvaluing” her values, establishing a\nnew “order of rank.” Through his prophet, Zarathustra,\nNietzsche imagined such a person as the “overman”\n(Übermensch), the one who teaches “the meaning of\nthe earth” and has no need of otherworldly supports for the\nvalues he embodies. The overman represents a form of life, a mode of\nexistence, that is to blossom from the communalized, moralized\n“last man” of the nineteenth century. He has understood\nthat nihilism is the ultimate meaning of the moral point of view, its\nlife-denying essence, and he reconfigures the moral idea of autonomy\nso as to release the life-affirming potential within it. \nThus, for Nietzsche, existence emerges as a philosophical problem in\nhis distinction between moral autonomy (as obedience to the moral law)\nand an autonomy “beyond good and evil.” But if one is to\nspeak of autonomy, meaning, and value at all, the mode of being beyond\ngood and evil cannot simply be a lawless state of arbitrary and\nimpulsive behavior. If such existence is to be thinkable there must be\na standard by which success or failure can be measured. Nietzsche\nvariously indicates such a standard in his references to\n“health,” “strength,” and “the meaning\nof the earth.” Perhaps his most instructive indication, however,\ncomes from aesthetics, since its concept of style, as\nelaborated in The Gay Science, provides a norm appropriate to\nthe singularity of existence. To say that a work of art has style is\nto invoke a standard for judging it, but one that cannot be specified\nin the form of a general law of which the work would be a mere\ninstance. Rather, in a curious way, the norm is internal to the work.\nFor Nietzsche, existence falls under such an imperative of style: to\ncreate meaning and value in a world from which all transcendent\nsupports have fallen away is to give unique shape to one’s\nimmediate inclinations, drives, and passions; to interpret, prune, and\nenhance according to a unifying sensibility, a ruling instinct, that\nbrings everything into a whole that satisfies the non-conceptual,\naesthetic norm of what fits, what belongs, what is appropriate. \nAs did Kierkegaard, then, Nietzsche uncovers an aspect of my being\nthat can be understood neither in terms of immediate drives and\ninclinations nor in terms of a universal law of behavior, an aspect\nthat is measured not in terms of an objective inventory of\nwhat I am but in terms of my way of being it.\nNeither Kierkegaard nor Nietzsche, however, developed this insight in\na fully systematic way. That would be left to their twentieth-century\nheirs. \nSartre’s slogan—“existence precedes\nessence”—may serve to introduce what is most distinctive\nof existentialism, namely, the idea that no general, non-formal\naccount of what it means to be human can be given, since that meaning\nis decided in and through existing itself. Existence is\n“self-making-in-a-situation” (Fackenheim 1961: 37). Webber\n(2018: 14) puts the point this way: “Classical existentialism is\n... the theory that existence precedes essence,” that is,\n“there is no such thing as human nature” in an\nAristotelian sense. A “person does not have an inbuilt set of\nvalues that they are inherently structured to pursue. Rather, the\nvalues that shape a person’s behavior result from the choices\nthey have made” (2018: 4). In contrast to other entities, whose\nessential properties are fixed by the kind of entities they\nare, what is essential to a human being—what makes her\nwho she is—is not fixed by her type but by what she\nmakes of herself, who she\n becomes.[6]\n The fundamental contribution of existential thought lies in the idea\nthat one’s identity is constituted neither by nature nor by\nculture, since to “exist” is precisely to constitute such\nan identity. It is in light of this idea that key existential notions\nsuch as facticity, transcendence (project), alienation, and\nauthenticity must be understood. \nAt first, it seems hard to understand how one can say much about\nexistence as such. Traditionally, philosophers have connected the\nconcept of existence with that of essence in such a way that the\nformer signifies merely the instantiation of the latter. If\n“essence” designates what a thing is and\n“existence” that it is, it follows that what is\nintelligible about any given thing, what can be thought about it, will\nbelong to its essence. It is from essence in this sense—say,\nhuman being as rational animal or imago Dei—that\nancient philosophy drew its prescriptions for an individual’s\nway of life, its estimation of the meaning and value of existence.\nHaving an essence meant that human beings could be placed within a\nlarger whole, a kosmos, that provided the standard for human\nflourishing. Modern philosophy retained this framework even as it\nabandoned the idea of a “natural place” for man in the\nface of the scientific picture of an infinite, labyrinthine universe.\nIn what looks like a proto-existential move, Descartes rejected the\ntraditional essential definitions of man in favor of a radical,\nfirst-person reflection on his own existence, the “I am.”\nNevertheless, he quickly reinstated the old model by characterizing\nhis existence as that of a substance determined by an essential\nproperty, “thinking.” In contrast, Heidegger proposes that\n“I” am “an entity whose what [essence] is precisely\nto be and nothing but to be” (Heidegger 1925 [1985, 110]; 1927 [1962, 67]).\nSuch an entity’s existing cannot, therefore, be thought as the\ninstantiation of an essence, and consequently what it means to be such\nan entity cannot be determined by appeal to pre-given frameworks or\nsystems—whether scientific, historical, or philosophical. \nOf course, there is a sense in which human beings do instantiate\nessences, as Heidegger’s phrase already\n admits.[7]\n But what matters for existential thought is the manner of\nsuch instantiation, the way of existing. What this means can\nbe seen by contrasting human existence with the modes of being\nHeidegger terms the “available” (or\n“ready-to-hand,” zuhanden) and the\n“occurrent” (or “present-at-hand,”\nvorhanden). Entities of the first sort, exemplified by tools\nas they present themselves in use, are defined by the social practices\nin which they are employed, and their properties are established in\nrelation to the norms of those practices. A saw is sharp, for\ninstance, in relation to what counts as successful cutting. Entities\nof the second sort, exemplified by objects of perceptual contemplation\nor scientific investigation, are defined by the norms governing\nperceptual givenness or scientific theory-construction. An available\nor occurrent entity instantiates some property if that property is\ntruly predicated of it. Human beings can be considered in this way as\nwell. However, in contrast to the previous cases, the fact that\nnatural and social properties can truly be predicated of human beings\nis not sufficient to determine what it is for me to be a\nhuman being. This, the existentialists argue, is because such\nproperties are never merely brute determinations of who I am but are\nalways in question. Who I am depends on what I make of my\n“properties”; they matter to me in a way that is\nimpossible for merely available and occurrent entities. As Heidegger\nputs it, existence is “care” (Sorge): to exist is\nnot simply to be, but to be an issue for oneself. In\nSartre’s terms, while other entities exist “in\nthemselves” (en soi) and “are what they\nare,” human reality is also “for itself” (pour\nsoi) and thus is not exhausted by any of its determinations. It\nis what it is not and is not what it is (Sartre 1943 [1992, 112]).  \nHuman existence, then, cannot be thought through categories\nappropriate to things: substance, event, process. There is something\nof an internal distinction in existence that undermines such attempts,\na distinction that existential philosophers try to capture in the\ncategories of “facticity” and “transcendence.”\nTo be is to co-ordinate these opposed moments in some way, and who I\nam, my essence, is nothing but my manner of co-ordinating\nthem. In this sense, human beings make themselves in situation: what I\nam cannot be separated from what I take myself to be. In\nCharles Taylor’s phrase, human beings are\n“self-interpreting animals” (Taylor 1985: 45), where the\ninterpretation is constitutive of the interpreter. If such a view is\nnot to collapse into contradiction, the notions of facticity and\ntranscendence must be elucidated. Risking some oversimplification,\nthey can be approached as the correlates of the two attitudes I can\ntake toward myself: the attitude of third-person theoretical observer\nand the attitude of first-person practical agent. \nFacticity includes all those properties that third-person\ninvestigation can establish about me: natural properties such as\nweight, height, and skin color; social facts such as race, class, and\nnationality; psychological properties such as my web of belief,\ndesires, and character traits; historical facts such as my past\nactions, my family background, and my broader historical milieu; and\nso\n on.[8]\n I am not originally aware of my facticity in this third-person way;\nrather, it is manifest in my moods as a kind of burden, the weight of\n“having to be.” However, I can adopt a\nthird-person or objectifying stance toward my own being, and then\nthese aspects of my facticity may appear precisely as that which\ndefines or determines who I am. From an existential point of view,\nhowever, this would be an error—not because these\naspects of my being are not real or factual, but because the kind of\nbeing that I am cannot be defined in factual, or\nthird-person,\n terms.[9]\n These elements of facticity cannot be said to belong to me in the way\nthat the color of an apple belongs to the apple, for as\nbelonging to me, as “determining” me, they have\nalways already been interpreted by me. Though third-person\nobservation can identify skin color, class, or ethnicity, the minute\nit seeks to identify them as mine it must contend with the\ndistinctive character of the existence I possess. There is no sense in\nwhich facticity is both mine and merely a matter of fact,\nsince my existence—the kind of being I am—is also defined\nby the stance I take toward my facticity. The ability to take such a\nstance is what existential philosophers call\n“transcendence.” \nTranscendence refers to that attitude toward myself characteristic of\nmy practical engagement in the world, the agent’s perspective.\nAn agent is oriented by the task at hand as something to be brought\nabout through its own will or agency. Such orientation does not take\nitself as a theme but loses itself in what is to be done. Thereby,\nthings present themselves not as indifferent givens, facts, but as\nmeaningful: salient, expedient, obstructive, and so on. To speak of\n“transcendence” here is to indicate that the agent\n“goes beyond” what simply is toward what can be: the\nfactual—including the agent’s own properties—always\nemerges in light of the possible, where the possible is not a function\nof anonymous forces (third-person or logical possibility) but a\nfunction of the agent’s choice and\n decision.[10]\n Just as this suddenly empty pen is either a nettlesome impediment to\nmy finishing this article, or a welcome occasion for doing something\nelse, depending on how I determine my behavior in relation to it, so\ntoo my own factic properties—such as irrascibility, laziness, or\nbourgeois workaholism—take on meaning, become motivating or\nnormative reasons, on the basis of how I endorse or disavow\nthem in the present action. \nExistentialists tend to describe the perspective of engaged agency in\nterms of “choice,” and they are sometimes criticized for\nthis. It may be—the argument runs—that I can be said to\nchoose a course of action at the conclusion of a process of\ndeliberation, but there seems to be no choice involved when, in the\nheat of the moment, I toss the useless pen aside in frustration. Can\nits being useless be traced back to my “choice” to be\nfrustrated? But the point in using such language is simply to insist\nthat in the first-person perspective of agency I cannot\nconceive myself as determined by anything that is available\nto me only in third-person terms. Behind the existentialist’s\ninsistence that facticity and transcendence remain irreducible aspects\nof one and the same being is the insight that, for a being who can say\n“I,” the third-person perspective on who one is has no\nmore authority than the first-person (agent’s)\n perspective.[11] \nBecause existence is co-constituted by facticity and transcendence,\nthe self cannot be conceived as a Cartesian ego but is embodied\nbeing-in-the-world, a self-making in situation. It is through\ntranscendence—or what the existentialists also refer to as my\n“projects”—that the world is revealed, takes on\nmeaning; but such projects are themselves factic or\n“situated”—not the product of some antecedently\nconstituted “person” or intelligible character but\nembedded in a world that is decidedly not my representation. Because\nmy projects are who I am in the mode of engaged agency\n(unlike plans that I merely represent to myself in reflective\ndeliberation), the world in a certain sense reveals to me who I am.\nFor reasons to be explored in the next section, the meaning of my\nchoice is not always transparent to me. Nevertheless, because it\nnecessarily reveals the world in a certain way, that meaning, my own\n“identity,” can be discovered by what Sartre calls\n“existential psychoanalysis.” By understanding an\nindividual’s patterns of behavior—that is, by\nreconstructing the meaningful world that such behavior\nreveals—one can uncover the “fundamental project” or\nbasic choice of oneself that gives distinctive shape to an individual\nlife. Existential psychoanalysis represents a kind of compromise\nbetween the first- and third-person perspectives: like the latter, it\nobjectifies the person and treats its open-ended practical horizons as\nin a certain sense closed; like the former, however, it seeks to\nunderstand the choices from the inside, to grasp the identity of the\nindividual as a matter of the first-person meaning that haunts him,\nrather than as a function of inert psychic mechanisms with which the\nindividual has no\n acquaintance.[12] \nThe anti-Cartesian view of the self-in-situation yields the familiar\nexistential theme of the “alienated” self, the\nestrangement of the self both from the world and from itself. In the\nfirst place, while it is through my projects that the world takes on\nmeaning, the world itself is not brought into being through my\nprojects; it retains its otherness and thus can come forth as utterly\nalien, as unheimlich. Sometimes translated as\n“uncanny,” this Heideggerian word’s stem\n(Heim, “home”) points to the strangeness of a\nworld in which I precisely do not feel “at home.”\n(see the section on\n The Ideality of Values\n below). This experience, basic to existential thought, contrasts most\nsharply with the ancient notion of a kosmos in which human\nbeings have a well-ordered place, and it connects existential thought\ntightly to the modern experience of a meaningless universe. \nIn the second place, the world includes other people, and as a\nconsequence I am not merely the revealer of the world but something\nrevealed in the projects of those others. Thus, who I am is not merely\na function of my own projects but is also a matter of my\n“being-for-others.” Sartre (1992: 340-58) brings out this\nform of alienation in his famous analysis of “the Look.”\nSo long as I am engaged unreflectively in a certain practice, I am\nnothing but that first-person perspective which constitutes things as\nhaving a distinctive salience in light of what I am doing. I am\nabsorbed in the world and do not experience myself as having an\n“outside”; that is, I do not understand my action through\nsome third-person description, as an instance of some general\nbehavior. However, when I become aware of being looked at (that is,\nwhen my subjectivity is invaded by the subjectivity of another for\nwhom I am merely part of the world, an item for her projects ), I\nbecome aware of having a “nature,” a\n“character,” of being or doing something. I am\nnot merely looking through a keyhole; I am a voyeur. I cannot\noriginally experience myself as something—a voyeur, for\ninstance. Only the other can give rise to this mode of my being, a\nmode that I acknowledge as mine (and not merely the\nother’s opinion of me) in the shame in which I register\nit. It is because there are others in the world that I can take a\nthird-person perspective on myself, but this reveals the extent to\nwhich I am alienated from a dimension of my being: who I am\nin an objective sense can be originally revealed only by the Other.\nThis has implications for existential social theory (see the section\non\n Sartre: Existentialism and Marxism\n below). \nFinally, the self-understanding, or project, thanks to which the world\nis there for me in a meaningful way, already belongs to that world,\nderives from it, from the tradition or society in which I find myself.\nThough it is “me,” it is not me “as my own.”\nMy very engagement in the world alienates me from my authentic\npossibility. This theme is brought out most clearly by Heidegger: the\nanti-Cartesian idea that the self is defined first of all by its\npractical engagement entails that this self is not properly individual\nbut rather indisinguishable from anyone else (das Man) who\nengages in such practices. Such a “they-self” does what\n“one” does. The idea is something like this: Practices can\nallow things to show up as meaningful—as hammers, dollar bills,\nor artworks—because practices involve aims that carry with them\nnorms, satisfaction conditions, for what shows up in them. But norms\nand rules, as Wittgenstein has shown, are essentially public, and that\nmeans that when I engage in a practice I must be essentially\ninterchangeable with anyone else who does: I eat as one eats, I drive\nas one drives, I even protest as one protests. To the extent that my\nactivity is to be an instance of such a practice, I must do it in the\nnormal way. Deviations can be recognized as (perhaps salutary)\ndeviations only against this norm, but if they deviate too much they\ncan’t be recognized at\n all.[13]\n Thus, if who I am is defined through existing, this “who”\nis normally pre-defined by what is average, by the roles available to\nme in my culture. The “I” that gets defined is thereby\n“anonymous,” or “anyone”; self-making is\nlargely a function of not distinguishing myself from\nothers. \nIf there is nevertheless good sense in talk of the singularity of\nmy existence, it will not be as something with which one starts but as \nsomething that gets achieved in recovering oneself from\nalienation or lostness in the “crowd.” If the normative is\nfirst of all the normal, however, it might seem that talk about a norm\nfor the singularity of existence, a standard for thinking\nabout what is my ownmost just as I myself, would be\nincoherent. It is here that the idea of “authenticity”\ncomes into focus. \nBy what standard are we to think our efforts “to be,” our\nmanner of being a self? If such standards traditionally derive from\nthe essence that a particular thing instantiates—this hammer is\na good one if it instantiates what a hammer is supposed to\nbe—and if there is nothing that a human being is, by its\nessence, supposed to be, can the meaning of existence at all\nbe thought? Existentialism arises with the collapse of the idea that\nphilosophy can provide substantive norms for existing, ones that\nspecify particular ways of life. Nevertheless, there remains the\ndistinction between what I do “as” myself and as\n“anyone,” so in this sense existing is something at which\nI can succeed or fail. Authenticity—in German,\nEigentlichkeit—names that attitude in which I engage in\nmy projects as my own (eigen). \nWhat this means can perhaps be brought out by considering moral\nevaluations. In keeping my promise, I act in accord with duty; and if I\nkeep it because it is my duty, I also act morally (according\nto Kant) because I am acting for the sake of duty. But\nexistentially there is still a further evaluation to be made. My moral\nact is inauthentic if, in keeping my promise for the sake of\nduty, I do so because that is what “one” does (what\n“moral people” do). But I can do the same thing\nauthentically if, in keeping my promise for the sake of duty,\nacting this way is something I choose as my own, something to\nwhich, apart from its social sanction, I commit myself. Similarly,\ndoing the right thing from a fixed and stable character—which\nvirtue ethics considers a condition of the good—is not beyond\nthe reach of existential evaluation: such character may simply be a\nproduct of my tendency to “do what one does,” including\nfeeling “the right way” about things and betaking myself\nin appropriate ways as one is expected to do. But such character might\nalso be a reflection of my choice of myself, a\ncommitment I make to be a person of this sort. In both cases\nI have succeeded in being good; only in the latter case, however, have\nI succeeded in being\n myself.[14] \nThus the norm of authenticity refers to a kind of\n“transparency” with regard to my situation, a recognition\nthat I am a being who can be responsible for who I am. In\nchoosing in light of this norm I can be said to recover myself from\nalienation, from my absorption in the anonymous “one-self”\nthat characterizes me in my everyday engagement in the world.\nAuthenticity thus indicates a certain kind of integrity—not that\nof a pre-given whole, an identity waiting to be discovered, but that\nof a project to which I can either commit myself (and thus\n“become” what it entails) or else simply occupy for a\ntime, inauthentically drifting in and out of various roles. Some\nwriters have taken this notion a step further, arguing that the\nmeasure of an authentic life lies in the integrity of a\nnarrative, that to be a self is to constitute a story in\nwhich a kind of wholeness prevails, to be the author of oneself as a\nunique individual (Nehamas 1998; Ricoeur 1992). In contrast, the\ninauthentic life would be one without such integrity, one in which I\nallow my life-story to be dictated by the world. Be that as it may, it\nis clear that one can commit oneself to a life of chameleon-like\nvariety, as does Don Juan in Kierkegaard’s version of the\nlegend. Even interpreted narratively, then, the norm of authenticity\nremains a formal one. As with Kierkegaard’s Knight of Faith, one\ncannot tell who is authentic by looking at the content of their\n lives.[15] \nAuthenticity defines a condition on self-making: do I succeed in\nmaking myself, or will who I am merely be a function of the\nroles I find myself in? Thus to be authentic can also be thought as a\nway of being autonomous. In choosing\n“resolutely”—that is, in commiting myself to a\ncertain course of action, a certain way of being in the world—I\nhave given myself the rule that belongs to the role I come to adopt.\nThe inauthentic person, in contrast, merely occupies such a\nrole, and may do so “irresolutely,” without commitment.\nBeing a father in an authentic way does not necessarily make me a\nbetter father, but what it means to be a father has become\nexplicitly my concern. It is here that existentialism locates\nthe singularity of existence and identifies what is irreducible in the\nfirst-person stance. At the same time, authenticity does not hold out\nsome specific way of life as a norm; that is, it does not distinguish\nbetween the projects that I might choose. Instead, it governs the\nmanner in which I am engaged in such projects—either as\n“my own” or as “what one does,” transparently\nor opaquely. \nThus existentialism’s focus on authenticity leads to a\ndistinctive stance toward ethics and value-theory generally. The\npossibility of authenticity is a mark of my freedom, and it\nis through freedom that existentialism approaches questions of value,\nleading to many of its most recognizable doctrines. \nExistentialism did not develop much in the way of a normative ethics;\nhowever, a certain approach to the theory of value and to moral\npsychology, deriving from the idea of existence as self-making in\nsituation, is a distinctive mark of the existentialist\n tradition.[16]\n In value theory, existentialists tend to emphasize the\nconventionality or groundlessness of values, their\n“ideality,” the fact that they arise entirely through the\nprojects of human beings against the background of an otherwise\nmeaningless and indifferent world. Existential moral psychology\nemphasizes human freedom and focuses on the sources of mendacity,\nself-deception, and hypocrisy in moral consciousness. The familiar\nexistential themes of anxiety, nothingness, and the absurd must be\nunderstood in this context. At the same time, there is deep concern to\nfoster an authentic stance toward human, groundless, values\nwithout which no project is possible, a concern that gets expressed in\nthe notions of “engagement” and\n “commitment.”[17] \nAs a predicate of existence, the concept of freedom is not initially\nestablished on the basis of arguments against determinism; nor is it\ntaken, in Kantian fashion, simply as a given of practical\nself-consciousness. Rather, it is located in the breakdown of\ndirect practical activity. The “evidence” of freedom is a\nmatter neither of theoretical nor of practical consciousness but\narises from the self-understanding that accompanies a certain\nmood into which I may fall, namely, anxiety (Angst,\nangoisse). Both Heidegger and Sartre believe that\nphenomenological analysis of the kind of intentionality that belongs\nto moods does not merely register a passing modification of the psyche\nbut reveals fundamental aspects of the self. Fear, for instance,\nreveals some region of the world as threatening, some element in it as\na threat, and myself as vulnerable. In anxiety, as in fear, I grasp\nmyself as threatened or as vulnerable; but unlike fear, anxiety has no\ndirect object, there is nothing in the world that is threatening. This\nis because anxiety pulls me altogether out of the circuit of those\nprojects thanks to which things are there for me in meaningful ways; I\ncan no longer “gear into” the world. And with this\ncollapse of my practical immersion in roles and projects, I also lose\nthe basic sense of who I am that is provided by these roles. In thus\nrobbing me of the possibility of practical self-identification,\nanxiety teaches me that I do not coincide with anything that I\nfactically am. Further, since the identity bound up with such roles\nand practices is always typical and public, the collapse of this\nidentity reveals an ultimately first-personal aspect of myself that is\nirreducible to das Man. As Heidegger puts it, anxiety\ntestifies to a kind of “existential solipsism.” It is this\nreluctant, because disorienting and dispossessing, retreat into myself\nin anxiety that yields the existential figure of the outsider, the\nisolated one who “sees through” the phoniness of those\nwho, unaware of what the breakdown of anxiety portends, live their\nlives complacently identifying with their roles as though these roles\nthoroughly defined them. While this “outsider” stance may\nbe easy to ridicule as adolescent self-absorption, it is also solidly\nsupported by the phenomenology (or moral psychology) of first-person\nexperience. \nThe experience of anxiety also yields the existential theme of the\nabsurd, a version of what was previously introduced as\nalienation from the world (see the section on\n Alienation\n above). So long as I am gearing into the world practically, in a\nseamless and absorbed way, things present themselves as meaningfully\nco-ordinated with the projects in which I am engaged; they show me the\nface that is relevant to what I am doing. But the connection between\nthese meanings and my projects is not itself something that I\nexperience. Rather, the hammer’s usefulness, its value as a\nhammer, appears simply to belong to it in the same way that its weight\nor color does. So long as I am practically engaged, in short, all\nthings appear to have reasons for being, and I, correlatively,\nexperience myself as fully at home in the world. The world has an\norder that is largely transparent to me (even its mysteries are\ngrasped simply as something for which there are reasons that are there\n“for others,” for “experts,” merely beyond my\nlimited horizon). In the mood of anxiety, however, it is just this\ncharacter that fades from the world. Because I am no longer\npractically engaged, the meaning that had previously inhabited the\nthing as the density of its being now stares back at me as a mere\nname, as something I “know” but which no longer\nclaims me. As when one repeats a word until it loses meaning, anxiety\nundermines the taken-for-granted sense of things. They become\nabsurd. Things do not disappear, but all that remains of them\nis the blank recognition that they are—an experience\nthat informs a central scene in Sartre’s novel Nausea.\nAs Roquentin sits in a park, the root of a tree loses its character of\nfamiliarity until he is overcome by nausea at its utterly alien\ncharacter, its being en soi. While such an experience is no\nmore genuine than my practical, engaged experience of a world\nof meaning, it is no less genuine either. An existential\naccount of meaning and value must recognize both\npossibilities (and their intermediaries). To do so is to acknowledge a\ncertain absurdity to existence: though reason and value have a\nfoothold in the world (they are not, after all, my arbitrary\ninvention), they nevertheless lack any ultimate foundation. Values are\nnot intrinsic to being, and at some point reasons give\n out.[18] \nAnother term for the groundlessness of the world of meaning is\n“nothingness.” Heidegger introduced this term to indicate\nthe kind of self- and world-understanding that emerges in anxiety:\nbecause my practical identity is constituted by the practices I engage\nin, when these collapse I “am” not anything. In a manner\nof speaking I am thus brought face-to-face with my own finitude, my\n“death,” as the possibility in which I am no longer able to\nbe anything. This experience of my own death, or\n“nothingness,” in anxiety can act as a spur to\nauthenticity: I come to see that I “am” not anything but\nmust “make myself be” through my choice. In\ncommiting myself in the face of death—that is, aware of\nthe nothingness of my identity if not supported by me right up to the\nend—the roles that I have hitherto thoughtlessly engaged in as\none does now become something that I myself own up to, become\nresponsible for. Heidegger termed this mode of\nself-awareness—awareness of the ultimate nothingness of my\npractical identity—“freedom,” and Sartre developed\nthis existential concept of freedom in rich detail. This is not to say\nthat Heidegger’s and Sartre’s views on freedom are\nidentical. Heidegger, for instance, will emphasize that freedom is\nalways “thrown” into an historical situation from which it\ndraws its possibilities, while Sartre (who is equally aware of the\n“facticity” of our choices) will emphasize that such\n“possibilities” nevertheless underdetermine choice. But\nthe theory of radical freedom that Sartre develops is nevertheless\ndirectly rooted in Heidegger’s account of the nothingness of my\npractical identity. \nSartre (1943 [1992, 70]) argues that anxiety provides a lucid experience of\nthat freedom which, though often concealed, characterizes human\nexistence as such. For him, freedom is the dislocation of\nconsciousness from its object, the fundamental\n“nihilation” or negation by means of which consciousness\ncan grasp its object without losing itself in it: to be conscious of\nsomething is to be conscious of not being it, a\n“not” that arises in the very structure of consciousness\nas being for-itself. Because “nothingness” (or nihilation)\nis just what consciousness is, there can be no objects in\nconsciousness, but only objects for\n consciousness.[19]\n This means that consciousness is radically free, since its structure\nprecludes that it either contain or be acted on by\nthings. For instance, because it is not thing-like, consciousness is\nfree with regard to its own prior states. Motives, instincts, psychic\nforces, and the like cannot be understood as inhabitants of\nconsciousness that might infect freedom from within, inducing one to\nact in ways for which one is not responsible; rather, they can exist\nonly for consciousness as matters of choice. I must either\nreject their claims or avow them. For Sartre, the ontological freedom\nof existence entails that determinism is an excuse before it\nis a theory: though through its structure of nihilation consciousness\nescapes that which would define it—including its own past\nchoices and behavior—there are times when I may wish to deny my\nfreedom. Thus I may attempt to constitute these aspects of my being as\nobjective “forces” which hold sway over me in the manner\nof relations between things. This is to adopt the third-person stance\nin which what is originally structured in terms of freedom\nappears as a causal property of myself. I can try to look upon myself\nas the Other does, but as an excuse this flight from freedom is shown\nto fail, according to Sartre, in the experience of\nanguish. \nFor instance, Sartre writes of a gambler who, after losing all and\nfearing for himself and his family, retreats to the reflective\nbehavior of resolving never to gamble again. This motive thus enters\ninto his facticity as a choice he has made; and, as long as he retains\nhis fear, his living sense of himself as being threatened, it may\nappear to him that this resolve actually has causal force in keeping\nhim from gambling. However, one evening he confronts the gaming table\nand is overcome with anguish at the recognition that his resolve,\nwhile still “there,” retains none of its power: it is an\nobject for consciousness but is not (and never could have\nbeen) something in consciousness that was determining his\nactions. In order for it to influence his behavior he must avow it\nafresh, but this is just what he cannot do; indeed, just this is what\nhe hoped the original resolve would spare him from having to do. He\nwill have to “remake” the self who was in the original\nsituation of fear and threat. At this point, perhaps, he will try to\nrelieve himself of the anguish of freedom by giving in to the urge to gamble and\nchalking it up to “deeper” motives that overcame the\ninitial resolve, problems from his childhood perhaps. But anguish can\nrecur with regard to this strategy as well—for instance, if he\nneeds a loan to continue gambling and must convince someone that he is\n“as good as his word.” The possibilities for\nself-deception in such cases are\n endless.[20] \nAs Sartre points out in great detail, anguish, as the consciousness of\nfreedom, is not something that human beings welcome; rather, we seek\nstability, identity, and adopt the language of freedom only when it\nsuits us: those acts are considered by me to be my free acts which\nexactly match the self I want others to take me to be. We are\n“condemned to be free,” which means that we can never\nsimply be who we are but are separated from ourselves by the\nnothingness of having perpetually to re-choose, or re-commit,\nourselves to what we do. Characteristic of the existentialist outlook\nis the idea that we spend much of lives devising strategies for\ndenying or evading the anguish of freedom. One of these strategies is\n“bad faith.” Another is the appeal to values. \nThe idea that freedom is the origin of value—where freedom is\ndefined not in terms of acting rationally (Kant) but rather in\nexistential terms, as choice and transcendence—is the idea\nperhaps most closely associated with existentialism. So influential\nwas this general outlook on value that Karl-Otto Apel (1973: 235) came\nto speak of a kind of “official complementarity of\nexistentialism and scientism” in Western philosophy, according\nto which what can be justified rationally falls under the\n“value-free objectivism of science” while all other\nvalidity claims become matters for an “existential subjectivism\nof religious faith and ethical decisions.” Positivism attempted\nto provide a theory of “cognitive meaning” based on what\nit took to be the inner logic of scientific thought, and it relegated\nquestions of value to cognitive meaninglessness, reducing them to\nissues of emotive response and subjective preference. While it does\nnot explain evaluative language solely as a function of affective\nattitudes, existential thought, like positivism, denies that values\ncan be grounded in being—that is, that they can become the theme\nof a scientific investigation capable of distinguishing true (or\nvalid) from false\n values.[21]\n In this regard Sartre speaks of the “ideality” of values,\nby which he means not that they have some sort of timeless\nvalidity but that they have no real authority and cannot be used to\nunderwrite or justify my behavior. For Sartre, “values derive\ntheir meaning from an original projection of myself which stands as my\nchoice of myself in the world.” But if that is so, then I\ncannot, without circularity, appeal to values in order to justify this\nvery choice: “I make my decision concerning them—without\njustification and without excuse” (Sartre 1943 [1992, 78]). This\nso-called “decisionism” has been a hotly contested legacy\nof existentialism and deserves a closer look here. \nHow is it that values are supposed to be grounded in freedom? By\n“value” Sartre means those aspects of my experience that\ndo not merely causally effectuate something but rather make a\nclaim on me: I do not just see the homeless person but\nencounter him as “to be helped”; I do not just hear the\nother’s voice but register “a question to be answered\nhonestly”; I do not simply happen to sit quietly in church but\n“attend reverently”; I do not merely hear the alarm clock\nbut am “summoned to get up.” Values, then, as Sartre\nwrites, appear with the character of demands and as such they\n“lay claim to a foundation” or justification (Sartre 1943 [1992,\n76]). Why ought I help the homeless, answer honestly, sit\nreverently, or get up? Sartre does not claim that there is no answer\nto these questions but only that the answer depends, finally, on my\nchoice of “myself”, which cannot in turn be justfied by\nappeal to a value. As he puts it, “value derives its being from\nits exigency and not its exigency from its being.” The exigency\nof value cannot be grounded in being itself, since it would thereby\nlose its character as an ought; it would “cease even to be\nvalue” since it would have the kind of exigency (contrary to\nfreedom) possessed by a mere cause. Thus, against\nthen-current value-theoretical intuitionism, Sartre denies that value\ncan “deliver itself to a contemplative intuition which would\napprehend it as being value and thereby would derive from it\nits right over my freedom.” Instead, “it can be revealed\nonly to an active freedom which makes it exist as a value by\nthe sole fact of recognizing it as such” (Sartre 1943 [1992.\n76]). \nFor instance, I do not grasp the exigency of the alarm clock (its\ncharacter as a demand) in a kind of disinterested perception but only\nin the very act of responding to it, of getting up. If I fail to get\nup the alarm has, to that very extent, lost its exigency. Why\nmust I get up? At this point I may attempt to justify its\ndemand by appeal to other elements of the situation with which the\nalarm is bound up: I must get up because I must go to work. From this\npoint of view the alarm’s demand appears—and\nis—justified, and such justification will often suffice\nto get me going again. But the question of the foundation of value has\nsimply been displaced: now it is my job that, in my active engagement,\ntakes on the unquestioned exigency of a demand or value. But it too\nderives its being as a value from its exigency—that is, from my\nunreflective engagement in the overall practice of going to work.\nOught I go to work? Why not be “irresponsible”?\nIf a man’s got to eat, why not rather take up a life of crime?\nIf these questions have answers that are themselves exigent it can\nonly be because, at a still deeper level, I am engaged as having\nchosen myself as a person of a certain sort: respectable, responsible.\nFrom within that choice there is an answer about what I ought to\ndo, but outside that choice there is none—why should I be\nrespectable, law-abiding?—for it is only because some\nchoice has been made that anything at all can appear as compelling, as\nmaking a claim on me. Only if I am at some level\nengaged do values (and so justification in terms of them)\nappear at all. The more I pull out of engagement toward reflection on,\nand questioning of, my situation, the more I am threatened by ethical\nanguish—“which is the recognition of the ideality of\nvalues” (Sartre 1943 [1992, 76]). And, as with all anguish, I do not\nescape this situation by discovering the true order of values but by\nplunging back into action. If the idea that values are without\nfoundation in being can be understood as a form of nihilism, the\nexistential response to this condition of the modern world is to point\nout that meaning, value, is not first of all a matter of contemplative\ntheory but a consequence of engagement and commitment. \nThus value judgments can be justified, but only relative to some\nconcrete and specific project. The “pattern of behavior”\nof the typical bourgeois defines the meaning of\n“respectability” (Sartre 1943 [1992, 77]), and so it is true of\nsome particular bit of behavior that it is either respectable or not.\nFor this reason I can be in error about what I ought to do. It may be\nthat something that appears exigent during the course of my\nunreflective engagement in the world is something that I ought not to\ngive in to. If, thanks to my commitment to the Resistance, a given\nofficial appears to me as to be shot, I might nevertheless be wrong to\nshoot him—if, for instance, the official was not who I thought\nhe was, or if killing him would in fact prove counter-productive given\nmy longer-term goals. Sartre’s fictional works are full of\nexplorations of moral psychology of this sort. But I cannot extend\nthese “hypothetical” justifications to a point where some\npurely theoretical consideration of my obligations—whether\nderived from the will of God, from Reason, or from the situation\nitself—could underwrite my freedom in such a way as to relieve\nit of responsibility. For in order for such considerations to\ncount I would have to make myself the sort of person for whom\nGod’s will, abstract Reason, or the current situation is\ndecisive. For existentialists like Sartre, then, I am\n“the one who finally makes values exist in order to determine\n[my] actions by their\n demands.”[22] \nCommitment—or “engagement”—is thus ultimately\nthe basis for an authentically meaningful life, that is, one that\nanswers to the existential condition of being human and does not flee\nthat condition by appeal to an abstract system of reason or divine\nwill. Yet though I alone can commit myself to some way of life, some\nproject, I am never alone when I do so; nor do I do so in a social,\nhistorical, or political vacuum. If transcendence represents my\nradical freedom to define myself, facticity—that other aspect of\nmy being—represents the situated character of this\nself-making. Because freedom as transcendence undermines the idea of a\nstable, timeless system of moral norms, it is little wonder that\nexistential philosophers (with the exception of Simone de Beauvoir)\ndevoted scant energy to questions of normative moral theory. However,\nbecause this freedom is always socially (and thereby historically)\nsituated, it is equally unsurprising that their writings are greatly\nconcerned with how our choices and commitments are concretely\ncontextualized in terms of political struggles and historical\nreality. \nFor the existentialists, engagement is the source of meaning and\nvalue; in choosing myself I in a certain sense make my world. On the\nother hand, I always choose myself in a context where there are others\ndoing the same thing, and in a world that has always already been\nthere. In short, my acting is situated, both socially and\nhistorically. Thus, in choosing myself in the first-person singular, I\nam also choosing in such a way that a first-person plural, a\n“we,” is simultaneously constituted. Such choices make up\nthe domain of social reality; they fit into a pre-determined context\nof roles and practices that go largely unquestioned and may be thought\nof as a kind of collective identity. In social action my identity\ntakes shape against a background (the collective identity of the\nsocial formation) that remains fixed. On the other hand, it can happen\nthat my choice puts this social formation or collective identity\nitself into question, and so who I am to be is thus inseparable from the\nquestion of who we are to be. Here the first-person plural is\nitself the issue, and the action that results from such choices\nconstitutes the field of the political. \nIf authenticity is the category by which I am able to think about what\nit means to “exist,” then the account of authenticity\ncannot neglect the social, historical, and political aspects of that\nexistence. Thus it is not merely because twentieth-century\nexistentialism flourished at a time when European history appeared to\ncollapse and political affairs loomed especially large that\nexistential philosophers devoted much attention to these matters;\nrather, the demand for an account of the “situation” stems\nfrom the very character of existence itself, which, unlike the\nclassical “rational subject,” is what it is only in\nrelation to its “time.” This is not to say, however, that\nexistential philosophers are unanimous in their account of the\nimportance of historical factors or in their estimation of the\npolitical in relation to other aspects of existence. Emmanuel Levinas,\nfor example, whose early phenomenological work belonged within the\norbit of existential philosophy, opposed to the\n“horizontal” temporality of political history a\n“vertical” or eschatological temporality that radically\nchallenged all historical meaning, while Sartre, in contrast, produced\na version of Marxist historical materialism in which existentialism\nitself became a mere ideology. But we cannot stop to examine all such\ndifferences here. Instead, we shall look at the positions of Heidegger\nand Sartre, who provide opposing examples of how an authentic relation\nto history and politics can be understood. \nFor Heidegger, to exist is to be historical. This does not mean that\none simply finds oneself at a particular moment in history, conceived\nas a linear series of events. Rather, it means that selfhood has a\npeculiar temporal structure that is the origin of that\n“history” which subsequently comes to be narrated in terms\nof a series of events. Existential temporality is not a sequence of\ninstants but instead a unified structure in which the\n“future” (that is, the possibility aimed at in my project)\nrecollects the “past” (that is, what no longer needs to be\ndone, the completed) so as to give meaning to the\n“present” (that is, the things that take on significance\nin light of what currently needs doing). To act, therefore, is, in\nHeidegger’s terms, to “historize”\n(geschehen), to constitute something like a narrative unity,\nwith beginning, middle, and end, that does not so much take place\nin time as provide the condition for linear time. To\nexist “between birth and death,” then, is not merely to be\npresent in each of a discrete series of temporal instants but to\nconstitute oneself in the unity of a history, and an authentic\nexistence is one in which the projects that give shape to\nexistence are ones to which I commit myself in light of this history.\nThough it belongs to, and defines, a “moment,” choice\ncannot be simply “of the moment”; to be authentic I must\nunderstand my choice in light of the potential wholeness of\nmy\n existence. \nThat this choice has a political dimension stems from the fact that\nexistence is always being-with-others. Though authenticity arises on\nthe basis of my being alienated, in anxiety, from the claims made by\nnorms belonging to the everyday life of das Man, any concrete\ncommitment that I make in the movement to recover myself will enlist\nthose norms in two ways. First, what I commit myself to will\nalways be derived from (though not reducible to) some\n“possibility of Dasein that has been there” (Heidegger 1927\n[1962, 438]): I cannot make my identity from whole cloth; I will always\nunderstand myself in terms of some way of existing that has been\nhanded down within my\n tradition.[23]\n I “choose my hero” (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 437]) by, for\ninstance, committing myself to a philosophical life, which I\nunderstand on the model of Socrates, or to a religious life, which I\nunderstand on the model of St. Francis. The point is that I must\nunderstand myself in terms of something, and these\npossibilities for understanding come from the historical heritage and\nthe norms that belong to it. Heidegger thinks of this historical\ndimension as a kind of “fate” (Schicksal): not\nsomething inevitable that controls my choice but something that,\ninherited from my historical situation, claims me, holds a\nkind of authority for me. \nThe second way in which the everyday norms of das Man are\nenlisted in authentic choice stems from the fact that when I commit\nmyself to my “fate” I do so “in and with my\n‘generation’” (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 436]). The idea here\nseems roughly to be this: To opt for a way of going on is to affirm\nthe norms that belong to it; and because of the nature of normativity,\nit is not possible to affirm norms that would hold only for\nme. There is a kind of publicity and scope in the normative\nsuch that, when I choose, I exemplify a standard for others as well.\nSimilarly, Heidegger holds that the sociality of my historizing\nrestricts what can be a genuine “fate” or choice for me.\nActing is always with others—more specifically, with a\n“community” or a “people”\n(Volk)—and together this “co-historizing”\nresponds to a “destiny” (Geschick) which has\nguided our fates in advance (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 436]). Not everything is\nreally possible for us, and an authentic choice must strive to respond\nto the claim that history makes on the people with whom one belongs,\nto seize its “destiny.” Along this communitarian axis,\nthen, existential historicality can open out onto the question of\npolitics: who are “we” to be? \nHeidegger suggests that it was this concept of historicality that\nunderwrote his own political engagement during the period of National\nSocialism in Germany. Disgusted with the political situation in Weimar\nGermany and characterizing it as especially irresolute or inauthentic,\nHeidegger looked upon Hitler’s movement as a way of recalling\nthe German people back to their “ownmost”\npossibility—i.e., a way for Germany to constitute itself\nauthentically as an alternative to the political models of the Soviet\nUnion and the United States. Heidegger’s choice to intervene in\nuniversity politics at this time was thus both a choice of\nhimself—in which he chose his hero: Plato’s\n“philosopher-king” (see Arendt 1978)—and a choice\nfor his “generation.” Much is controversial about\nHeidegger’s engagement for National Socialism (not least whether\nhe drew the appropriate consequences from his own concept of\n authenticity),[24]\n but it provides a clear example of a kind of existential politics\nthat depends on an ability to “tell time”—that is,\nto sense the imperatives of one’s factic historical situation.\nHeidegger later became very suspicious of this sort of existential\npolitics. Indeed, for the idea of authenticity as resolute commitment\nhe substituted the idea of “releasement”\n(Gelassenheit) and for engagement the stance of\n“waiting.” He came to believe that the problems that face\nus (notably, the dominance of technological ways of thinking) have\nroots that lie deeper than can be addressed through politics directly.\nHe thus famously denied that democracy was sufficient to deal with the\npolitical crisis posed by technology, asserting that “only a god\ncan save us” (Heidegger 1966 [1981, 55, 57]). But even here, in keeping\nwith the existential notion of historicity, Heidegger’s\nrecommendations turn on a reading of history, of the meaning of our\ntime. \nA very different reading, and a very different recommendation, can be\nfound in the work of Sartre. The basis for Sartre’s reading of\nhistory, and his politics, was laid in the section of Being and\nNothingness that describes the birth of the social in the\n“Look”(le regard) of the other. In making me an\nobject for his projects, the other alienates me from myself, displaces\nme from the subject position (the position from which the world is\ndefined in its meaning and value) and constitutes me as\nsomething. Concretely, what I am constituted “as” is a\nfunction of the other’s project and not something that I can\nmake myself be. I am constituted as a “Frenchman” in and\nthrough the hostility emanating from that German; I am constituted as\na “man” in this woman’s resentment; I am constituted\nas a “Jew” on the basis of the other’s\nanti-semitism; and so on. This sets up a dimension of my being that I\ncan neither control nor disavow, and my only recourse is to wrench\nmyself away from the other in an attempt to restore myself to the\nsubject-position. For this reason, on Sartre’s model, social\nreality is in perpetual conflict—an Hegelian dialectic in which,\nfor ontological reasons, no state of mutual recognition can ever be\nachieved. The “we”—the political subject—is\nalways contested, conflicted, unstable. \nBut this instability does have a certain structure, one which Sartre,\nsteeped in the Marxism of inter-war French thought (Alexandre\nKojève, Jean Hyppolite), explored in terms of a certain\nhistorical materialism. For social relations take place not only\nbetween human beings but also within institutions that have developed\nhistorically and that enshrine relations of power and domination. Thus\nthe struggle over who will take the subject position is not carried\nout on equal terms. As Simone de Beauvoir demonstrated in detail in\nher book, The Second Sex, the historical and institutional\nplace of women is defined in such a way that they are consigned to a\nkind of permanent “object” status—they are the\n“second” sex, since social norms are defined in male terms.\nThis being so, a woman’s struggle to develop self-defining\nprojects is constrained by a permanent institutional\n“Look” that already defines her as “woman,”\nwhereas a man need not operate under constraints of gender; he feels\nhimself to be simply “human,” pure subjectivity. Employing\nsimilar insights in reflection on the situations of racial and\neconomic oppression, Sartre sought a way to derive political\nimperatives in the face of the groundlessness of moral values entailed\nby his view of the ideality of values. \nAt first, Sartre argued that there was one value—namely freedom\nitself—that did have a kind of universal authority. To\ncommit oneself to anything is also always to commit oneself to the\nvalue of freedom. In “Existentialism is a Humanism” Sartre\ntried to establish this by way of a kind of transcendental argument,\nbut he soon gave up that strategy and pursued the more modest one of\nclaiming that the writer must always engage “on the\nside of freedom.” According to the theory of “engaged\nliterature” expounded in What is Literature?, in\ncreating a literary world the author is always acting either to\nimagine paths toward overcoming concrete unfreedoms such as racism and\ncapitalist exploitation, or else closing them off. In the latter case,\nhe contradicts himself, since the very idea of writing\npresupposes the freedom of the reader, and that means, in principle,\nthe whole of the reading public. Whatever the merits of this argument,\nit does suggest the political value to which Sartre remained committed\nthroughout his life: the value of freedom as self-making. \nThis commitment finally led Sartre to hold that existentialism itself\nwas only an “ideological” moment within Marxism, which he\ntermed “the one philosophy of our time which we cannot go\nbeyond” (Sartre 1960 [1968, xxxiv]). As this statement suggests,\nSartre’s embrace of Marxism was a function of his sense of\nhistory as the factic situation in which the project of self-making\ntakes place. Because existing is self-making (action),\nphilosophy—including existential philosophy—cannot be\nunderstood as a disinterested theorizing about timeless essences but\nis always a form of engagement, a diagnosis of the past and a\nprojection of norms appropriate to a different future in light of\nwhich the present takes on significance. It therefore always arises\nfrom the historical-political situation and is a way of intervening in\nit. Marxism, like existentialism, makes this necessarily practical\norientation of philosophy explicit. \nFrom the beginning existentialism saw itself in this activist way,\nproviding the basis for the most serious disagreements among French\nexistentialists such as Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Camus, many of\nwhich were fought out in the pages of the journal founded by Sartre\nand Merleau-Ponty, Les Temps \nModernes).[25]\n But the later Sartre came to hold\nthat a philosophy of self-making could not content itself with\nhighlighting the situation of individual choice; an authentic\npolitical identity could only emerge from a theory that\nsituated such choice in a practically oriented analysis of its\nconcrete situation. Thus it appeared to him that the “ideology\nof existence” was itself merely an alienated form of the deeper\nanalysis of social and historical reality provided by Marx’s\ndialectical approach. In focusing on the most important aspects of the\nmaterial condition in which the existential project of self-making\ntakes place—namely, economic relations under conditions of\nscarcity—Marx’s critique of capital offered a set of\nconsiderations that no “philosophy of freedom” could\nignore, considerations that would serve to orient political engagement\nuntil such time as “there will exist for everyone a\nmargin of real freedom beyond the production of life”\n(Sartre 1968: 34). Marxism is unsurpassable, therefore, because it is\nthe most lucid theory of our alienated situation of concrete\nunfreedom, oriented toward the practical-political overcoming of that\nunfreedom. \nSartre’s relation to orthodox Marxism was marked by tension,\nhowever, since he held that existing Marxism had abandoned the promise\nof its dialectical approach to social reality in favor of a dogmatic\n“apriorism” that subsumed historical reality under a\nblanket of lifeless abstractions. He thus undertook his Critique\nof Dialectical Reason to restore the promise of Marxism by\nreconceiving its concept of praxis in terms of the\nexistential notion of project. What had become a rigid\neconomic determinism would be restored to dialectical fluidity by\nrecalling the existential doctrine of self-making: it is true that man\nis “made” by history, but at the same time he is making\nthat very history. This attempt to “reconquer man within\nMarxism” (Sartre 1960 [1968, 83])—i.e., to develop a method which\nwould preserve the concrete details of human reality as lived\nexperience—was not well received by orthodox Marxists.\nSartre’s fascination with the details of Flaubert’s life,\nor the life of Baudelaire, smacked too much of “bourgeois\nidealism.” But we see here how Sartre’s politics, like\nHeidegger’s, derived from his concept of history: there are no\niron-clad laws that make the overthrow of capitalism the inevitable\noutcome of economic forces; there are only men in situation who make\nhistory as they are made by it. Dialectical materialism is the\nunsurpassable philosophy of those who choose, who commit themselves\nto, the value of freedom. The political claim that Marxism has on us,\nthen, would rest upon the ideological enclave within it: authentic\nexistence as choice. \nAuthentic existence thus has an historical, political dimension; all\nchoice will be attentive to history in the sense of contextualizing\nitself in some temporally narrative understanding of its place. But\neven here it must be admitted that what makes existence authentic is\nnot the correctness of the narrative understanding it adopts.\nAuthenticity does not depend on some particular substantive\nview of history, some particular theory or empirical story. From this\npoint of view, the substantive histories adopted by existential\nthinkers as different as Heidegger and Sartre should perhaps be read\nless as scientific accounts, defensible in third-person terms, than as\narticulations of the historical situation from the perspective of what\nthat situation is taken to demand, given the engaged commitment of\ntheir authors. They stand, in other words, less as\njustifications for their authors’ existential and\npolitical commitments than as themselves a form of politics:\ninvitations to others to see things as the author sees them, so that\nthe author’s commitment to going on in a certain way will come\nto be shared. \nAs a cultural movement, existentialism belongs to the past. As a\nphilosophical inquiry that introduced a new norm, authenticity, for\nunderstanding what it means to be human—a norm tied to a\ndistinctive, post-Cartesian concept of the self as practical,\nembodied, being-in-the-world—existentialism has continued to\nplay an important role in contemporary thought in both the continental\nand analytic traditions. The Society for Phenomenology and Existential\nPhilosophy and societies devoted to Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty,\nJaspers, Beauvoir, and other existential philosophers, provide a forum\nfor ongoing work—both of a historical, scholarly nature and of\nmore systematic focus—that continues what Khawaja called the\n“tradition” of existentialism, often bringing it into\nconfrontation with more recent movements such as structuralism,\ndeconstruction, hermeneutics, and feminism. \nIn the area of gender studies, Judith Butler (1990) draws importantly\non existential sources, as does Lewis Gordon (1995) in the area of\nrace theory (see also Bernasconi 2003). Matthew Ratcliffe (2008) and\nKevin Aho (2019) develop existential approaches to psychopathology.\nInterest in a narrative conception of self-identity—for\ninstance, in the work of Charles Taylor (1999), Paul Ricoeur, David\nCarr (1986), or Charles Guignon—has its roots in the existential\nrevision of Hegelian notions of temporality and its critique of\nrationalism. Hubert Dreyfus (1979) developed an influential criticism\nof the Artificial Intelligence program drawing essentially upon the\nexistentialist idea, found especially in Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty,\nthat the human world, the world of meaning, must be understood first\nof all as a function of our embodied practices and cannot be\nrepresented as a logically structured system of representations.\nCalling for a “new existentialism,” John Haugeland (1998)\nhas explored the role of existential commitment in scientific\npractices as truth-tracking practices. In metaphysics, Markus Gabriel\n(2018) has adopted the term “neo-existentialism” to\ndescribe a non-naturalistic view of mind in the “universe”\nthat does away with idealism’s “ontological\nasymmetry” in favor of a view in which mind is defined as the\nstruggle to make sense of the fact that it is not simply part of the\nuniverse, and that the familiar “worlds” it inhabits in\nthis struggle do not make up a whole. In a series of books, Michael\nGelven (e.g., 1990, 1997) has reflected upon the distinctions between\nexistential, moral, and epistemological or logical dimensions of\nexperience, showing how the standards appropriate to each intertwine,\nwithout reducing to any single one. A revival of interest in moral\npsychology finds many writers who are taking up the question of\nself-identity and responsibility in ways that recall the existential\nthemes of self-making and choice—for instance, Christine\nKorsgaard (1996) appeals crucially to notions of\n“self-constitution” and “practical identity”;\nRichard Moran (2001) emphasizes the connection between self-avowal and\nthe first-person perspective in a way that derives in part from\nSartre; and both Thomas Nagel and Bernard Williams pursued the\nexistentialist line that connects meaning to the finitude of our\nexistence. Even if such writers often proceed with more confidence in\nthe touchstone of rationality than did the classical existentialists,\ntheir work cultivates the terrain first glimpsed by the latter. And\ntoday, as we have noted, we can find fully-rounded arguments for an\nexistentialist ethics in writers like Webber and McMullin. \nIn addition, after years of being out of fashion in France,\nexistential motifs have once again become prominent in the work of\nleading thinkers. Foucault’s embrace of a certain concept of\nfreedom, and his exploration of the “care of the self,”\nrecall debates within existentialism, as does Derrida’s work on\nreligion without God and his reflections on the concepts of death,\nchoice, and responsibility. In very different ways, the books by\nCooper (1999) and Alan Schrift (1995) suggest that a re-appraisal of\nthe legacy of existentialism is an important agenda item of\ncontemporary philosophy. There are, in fact, reasons to think that\nsuch a re-evaluation is currently underway. Reynolds (2006), for\ninstance, concludes his introduction to existentialism with a\nconsideration of how post-structuralists such as Derrida, Deleuze, and\nFoucault extend certain reflections found in Sartre, Camus, and\nHeidegger, while Reynolds (2004) does the same, in more detail, for\nDerrida and Merleau-Ponty. Several further publications take up the\nchallenge of bringing existential thought into dialogue with items on\nthe contemporary philosophical agenda. Edward Baring (2011) exhumes\nthe historical relation between Derrida and existentialism and finds a\nkind of “‘Christian’ existentialism” in\nDerrida’s work prior to 1952, traces of which are discernible in\nhis later thinking. The collection edited by Judaken and Bernasconi\n(2012) explores the historical context of existentialist writings\ninformed by contemporary critiques of canonization. Feminist thought\nhas led to an explosion of work that re-evaluates the Beauvoir/Sartre\nrelationship and its significance for the origins of existentialism\nitself, for instance Kruks (1990, 1912), Bergoffen (1997), Arp (2001),\nHeinämaa (2003), Deutscher (2008) and Simons (2013). In 2011 The\nContinuum Companion to Existentialism appeared (Joseph, Reynolds,\nand Woodward 2011), followed by The Cambridge Companion to\nExistentialism (Crowell 2012a). Articles in both volumes are\ncommitted to showing the systematic relevance of existential concepts\nand approaches for contemporary work in philosophy and other fields.\nAs Kevin Aho remarks, in areas as diverse as cognitive science,\npsychiatry, health care, and environmental philosophy, “the\nlegacy of existentialism is alive and well” (2014: 140). If\nexistentialism’s very notoriety as a cultural movement may have\nimpeded its serious philosophical reception, it may be that what we\nhave most to learn from existentialism still lies before us.","contact.mail":"crowell@rice.edu","contact.domain":"rice.edu"}]
