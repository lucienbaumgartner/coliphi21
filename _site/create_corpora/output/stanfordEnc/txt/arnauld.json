He had a long and\nhighly controversial career as a theologian, and was an able and\ninfluential philosopher. His writings were published and widely read\nover a period of more than fifty years and were assembled in\n1775–1782 in forty-two large folio volumes.\n\n\nEvaluations of Arnauld’s work as a theologian vary. Ian Hacking,\nfor example, says that Arnauld was “perhaps the most brilliant\ntheologian of his time” (Hacking 1975a, 25). Ronald Knox, on the\nother hand, says, “It was the fashion among the Jansenists to\nrepresent Antoine Arnauld as a great theologian; he should be\nremembered, rather as a great controversialist… A theologian by\ntrade, Arnauld was a barrister by instinct” (Knox 1950, 196). It\nis agreed on all sides, however, that Arnauld was acute and learned in\ntheology as well as in philosophy.\n\n\nArnauld was an important participant in the philosophical debates of\nhis century, and carried out famous intellectual exchanges with\nDescartes, Malebranche, and Leibniz. In addition, the Port-Royal\nLogic, l’Art de penser, which he co-authored with\nPierre Nicole, was a standard text in the field for two centuries.\nLess attention has been paid to Arnauld’s lifelong efforts to\nreconcile the doctrine of grâce efficace par\nelle-même with freedom of will, though they have many\nconnections with the debate about determinism and free will that\ncontinues to this day.\n\nAntoine Arnauld was born in Paris on February 6, 1612, the twentieth\nand last child of an important French family. He is often referred to\nin the French literature as Le Grand Arnauld. Another famous\nmember of the family was his sister, Mère Angélique\nArnauld. Installed by her wealthy and powerful father as abbess of the\nconvent of Port-Royal in 1602 at the age of eleven, she later reformed\nthe convent and it became a center of intense religious life. Several\nof Arnauld’s sisters were nuns at Port-Royal, where his mother\njoined them after the death of his father in 1621. \nThe young Antoine attended the Collège de\nCalvi-Sorbonne, where one of his fellow students was his nephew,\nIsaac Lemaître de Sacy. Arnauld went on to study philosophy at\nthe Collège de Lisieux, and then decided to follow in\nhis father’s steps as a lawyer. However, under the influence of\nhis mother and her confessor, Jean Duvergier, the abbé de\nSaint-Cyran¸ he changed his mind and began studies in\ntheology in 1633. \nAbout 1640, he joined a small group of solitaires who lived\nin the countryside near Port-Royal and were associated with the\nconvent. They included Pierre Nicole, Claude Launcelot, and Sacy. The\nsolitaires initiated the petites écoles de\nPort-Royal which continued in various locations from the late\n1630s until 1660. Their students included the dramatist Jean Racine.\nLater on, Arnauld cooperated with Sacy in the first important French\ntranslation of the\n Bible.[1]\n He also co-authored the Grammaire générale et\nraisonnée with Lancelot and La Logique ou l’Art\nde penser (hereinafter Logic), with Nicole. All of these\ncollaborative projects had their origins in the petites\nécoles. Blaise Pascal was closely associated with the\nsolitaires beginning in 1655. \nThe year 1641 was an eventful one for Arnauld. He was ordained a\npriest on September 21. During the year, he completed the\n“Fourth Objections” to Descartes’\nMeditations and wrote De la Fréquente\ncommunion (published in 1643). The first work established his\nreputation as a philosopher. The second went through many editions and\nhad an effect on Catholic sacramental practice up to the end of the\nnineteenth century. Jansen’s Augustinus was also\npublished in Paris in 1641, having been published posthumously in the\nNetherlands a year earlier. It was attacked by the official theologian\nof Paris, Isaac Habert, who preached a series of sermons against\nJansen in the cathedral of Paris during Lent, 1643. Arnauld, who had\narrived at an interpretation of Augustine similar to, though not\nidentical with, that of Jansen, undertook, at the request of\nSaint-Cyran, to defend Jansen against the accusation of heresy. This\nhe did in his Première Apologie pour Jansénius,\n1644, and Seconde Apologie, 1645. Although Arnauld did not\nagree with important details of Jansen’s view, he continued to\ndefend Jansen against the charge of heresy off and on for the rest of\nhis life. \nIn 1653 the famous five propositions attributed to Jansen were\ndeclared to be heretical by Pope Innocent X in the Constitution\n“Cum Occasione.” Arnauld and most of the\nPort-Royal group claimed that the five propositions, although\nheretical on their most likely interpretation, were not in fact in\nJansen’s work. The dispute led to Arnauld’s expulsion from\nthe Sorbonne after a celebrated trial, which lasted from December 1,\n1655 to January 30, 1656. Pascal came to Arnauld’s defense with\nthe Provincial Letters, published in installments from\nJanuary 23, 1656 to May, 1657. The dispute lasted until 1669, when the\nFrench bishops who supported Arnauld worked out a compromise with Pope\nClement IX, and Arnauld enjoyed almost a decade in the good graces of\nboth the court and the Pope. During this time, Arnauld wrote\nvoluminously on the Eucharist, but he also found time to co-author the\nPort-Royal Grammar and Logic, and to write his\nNouveaux éléments de géométrie.\nHowever, in the late 1670s, the attacks on Port-Royal by civil and\nreligious authorities resumed, and in 1679 Arnauld fled to the\nNetherlands, where he remained until his death, in Liège, on\nAugust 8, 1694. \nThe last fifteen years of Arnauld’s life, spent in self-imposed\nexile, were among his most fruitful in philosophy. During this period,\nhe carried on his debates with Malebranche and Leibniz, and also\nreexamined his position on human free will. Arnauld’s published\ncriticism of Malebranche began in 1683 with On True and False\nIdeas (hereinafter Ideas). But the central topic of the\nexchange was Malebranche’s use of occasionalism to explain how\nit is that not all human beings are saved. Arnauld provided a\nsystematic criticism of that position in the three volumes of\nRéflexions philosophiques et théologiques sur le\nnouveau système de la nature et de la grâce\n(hereinafter Réflexions), published in 1685 and 1686.\nArnauld’s famous correspondence with Leibniz was initiated by\nLeibniz in 1686, when he sent Arnauld the section headings of his\nprojected Discourse on Metaphysics. \nArnauld considered it important to be clear about the distinction\nbetween philosophy and theology. This concern is present in his work\nfrom the beginning, in 1641, to the end of his published writings.\nThus, he divides the “Fourth Objections” to\nDescartes’ Meditations into “the possible\nphilosophical objections regarding the major issues of the nature of\nour mind and of God” and “the problems which a theologian\nmight come up against in the work as a whole”\n(Descartes, 2:169). One of Arnauld’s criticisms of\nMalebranche is that he does not establish many of the principles in\nhis system of nature and grace either by the proper methods of\nphilosophy or of theology. Again, in Règles du bon\nsens, written the year before his death, Arnauld warns, “Be\nvery careful about the nature of the question in dispute, whether it\nis philosophical or theological. For if it is theological, it must be\ndecided principally by authority, whereas if it is philosophical, it\nmust be decided principally by\n reason.”[2] \nAccording to Arnauld, the chief purpose of theology is to defend the\ntruths revealed by God through Sacred Scripture and the teaching\ntradition of the Church. Part of the ceremony in which he received the\ndoctorate in theology from the Sorbonne was a vow, made before the\naltar of the Holy Martyrs, “that we will give our life before\nleaving the truth undefended.” In the speech he gave on that\noccasion, Arnauld emphasized the vow, which he said was instituted\nbecause “the obligation to defend the truth with force and\ncourage is so indispensable in a theologian that those whose courage\nin this regard could weaken, should be committed to it by the holiness\nand piety of a solemn public vow” (Traduction du Discours\nlatin prononcé par M. Arnauld en recevant le Bonnet de\nDocteur, OA, 43:12). This intense religious commitment to his\nrole as a theologian continued throughout his life. Combined with his\ncombative personality, it helps to explain the passion with which he\ndefended individual theologians, especially Saint-Cyran and Jansen, as\nwell as what he took to be the truths of revelation. \nRegarding philosophy, Arnauld, like Descartes, held that its purpose\nwas to acquire useful knowledge through reason. That reason ought to\nbe employed only in the pursuit of useful knowledge is emphasized in\nthe opening pages of the Logic. Arnauld and Nicole say that\n“speculative sciences, such as geometry, astronomy, and\nphysics” can be used as instruments for perfecting judgment and\nreason. This provides a use for some of the “nooks and\ncrannies” of those sciences, which would otherwise be\n“completely worthless.” They go on to say, “People\nare not born to spend their time measuring lines, examining the\nrelations between angles, or contemplating different motions of\nmatter. The mind is too large, life too short, time too precious to\noccupy oneself with such trivial objects. But they are obligated to be\njust, fair, and judicious in all their speech, their actions, and the\nbusiness the conduct. Above all they ought to train and educate\nthemselves for this” (Logic, 5). Arnauld did not think,\nhowever, that philosophical sciences are useful only as instruments\nfor acquiring virtues. Natural philosophy or physics can be made to\nserve the good of human life in many ways and even metaphysics is\nuseful in that it can help the theologian in the task of defending the\ntruth. \nAn outstanding example of that sort of usefulness, in Arnauld’s\nview, was Descartes’ argument for the distinction of the soul or\nmind from the body. Arnauld refers to Descartes as a “Christian\nphilosopher,” echoing Descartes’ own use of the phrase in\nthe letter dedicating the Meditations on First Philosophy to\nthe Faculty of Theology of the Sorbonne, where Descartes says that he\ncarried out the injunction of the Fourth Lateran Council\n(1513–17) that “Christian philosophers” should try\nto prove the immateriality of the soul (Descartes, 2:4). \nThe authorities most often cited by Arnauld are Augustine and Aquinas\nin theology, and Augustine, Aquinas, and Descartes in philosophy.\nArnauld’s attitude toward these predecessors is complex. From\nthe outset of his published work in philosophy, he claimed that\nAugustinian themes were present in Descartes. However, in his late\nwork, beginning with On True and False Ideas in 1683, he\nbegan to cite Aquinas frequently, as well as Augustine, both in\nphilosophy and theology. Thus, in the 181 folio pages of\nIdeas, which Arnauld describes as dealing with a purely\nphilosophical topic, he cites Augustine twenty times and Aquinas six\ntimes, always claiming that they agree with Descartes and with his own\nposition. Similarly, in the theological part of\nRéflexions, Arnauld relies heavily on Aquinas’s\nChristology while arguing that Malebranche’s theodicy leads him\ninto heterodox, if not downright heretical, positions (OA\n39:777). Again, in his late work on the problem of human free will and\ngrâce efficace par elle-même, Arnauld took over\nwhat he says is the Thomistic position that the will is free when it\nis a potestas ou facultas ad opposita. And in the controversy\nwith Nicole and others over Nicole’s theory of a grâce\ngénérale, Arnauld relied heavily on Aquinas’s\naccount of cognition. So frequently did Arnauld rely on Thomistic\nformulations in his late work that his friends reproached him for\n“abandoning Augustine in order to follow Aquinas, thus\npreferring the disciple to the master” (Règles du bon\nsens, OA, 10:154). This reproach had to do directly with\nArnauld’s rejection of the “Platonism” in Augustine\nand Jansen. But as shown below, Arnauld, late in his career, also\nparted company with Augustine and Jansen on the nature of human free\nwill, and with Jansen’s account of the nature of actual\ngrace. \nArnauld had a scholarly knowledge of the history of philosophy and\ntheology, and was certainly aware of the important differences among\nAugustine, Aquinas, and Descartes on such issues as the role of sense\nperception in human knowledge, the relation of the mind to the body,\nand the nature of human freedom. But Arnauld wanted to emphasize the\ncontinuity of Descartes with the Christian past. Arnauld feared that\nDescartes’ philosophy would be made into a weapon against the\nChristian tradition. Emphasizing those elements in Descartes’\nphilosophy that are in continuity with Augustine and Aquinas was part\nof Arnauld’s effort to make of Cartesianism an ally, rather than\nan enemy, of the faith. \nUnlike Saint-Cyran, Jansen, and most of the Port-royalists, Arnauld\nhad a positive appreciation of philosophy, and a lively interest in\nthe subject (See Nadler 1989, 18 ff.). His philosophy is typically,\nand correctly, classified as Cartesian. Indeed, Leibniz said, in 1691,\nthat Arnauld had been “in all ways for Descartes for a long\n time.”[3]\n Arnauld enthusiastically endorsed Descartes’ physics and the\napproach to mind-body dualism to which it gave rise. He also adopted\nsome parts of Descartes’ views on philosophical method. \nArnauld’s Descartes, however, is unlike the Descartes who is\nseen as the father of the enlightenment and who anticipated many of\nthe preoccupations of recent analytical philosophy. Arnauld claims to\nset forth the gist of Descartes’ philosophy, but he did not\nhesitate to replace parts of Descartes’ philosophy with\ndifferent though related propositions, especially when doing so made\nDescartes a more reliable ally in what Arnauld took to be his primary\ntask, to defend the truths of the faith. \nIn the Fourth Part of the Logic, “On Method,”\nArnauld and Nicole present an account of the distinction between\nanalysis and synthesis that they say is taken from a manuscript of\nDescartes lent to them by Clerselier. What they present is a free\ntranslation of Rule Thirteen of the Rules for the Direction of the\nMind. They then paraphrase the four rules given by Descartes in\nPart Two of the Discourse on the Method, saying that although\nthe rules are “often difficult to follow,” yet “it\nis always helpful to bear them in mind, and to heed them as much as\npossible whenever we try to find the truth by means of reason”\n(Logic, 234–39). But Arnauld developed the Cartesian\nposition on philosophical method in a distinctive way. In particular,\nhe reshaped the notion of an idea, of a confused idea, of a clear and\ndistinct idea, and of methodic doubt. \nAn idea, according to Arnauld, is the same thing as a perception (in\nthe broad sense of the term characteristic of seventeenth-century\nphilosophy), and every perception has an object distinct from the\nperception itself. Every idea, i.e., every perception, is, in\naddition, a consciousness of itself. But this “implicit\nreflexion” makes present to the mind a perception that is, in\nthe first place, of an object distinct from itself. As Arnauld puts\nit, “I know myself in knowing other things”\n(Ideas, 6). It is obviously true, he says, that we can know\nobjects only through the mediation of our perceptions, i.e., our\nideas, of them: “But if, by not knowing them\nimmediately, is meant being able to know them only by\nrepresentative beings distinct from perceptions, I hold that\nin this sense we can know material things, as well as God and our\nsoul, not only mediately but also immediately, i.e.,\nthat we can know them without there being any intermediary between our\nperceptions and the object” (Ideas, 31). \nArnauld says that the object of any perception has objective\nbeing in the perception. Furthermore, the object has objective\nbeing in the perception as having properties. If an object\nexists objectively in a given perception as having a given property,\nthen Arnauld says that the perception represents the object\nas having that property, that is, makes the object known to the mind\nas having that\n property.[4]\n Furthermore, an idea (or perception) can represent its object to the\nperceiving mind as having this or that property contingently or\nnecessarily. Arnauld cites the dictum, “it is in the idea of\neach thing that we see its properties,” and takes it to refer to\nan explicit reflection upon an idea that represents its object as\nhaving certain properties necessarily. \nArnauld argues at length that this theory of ideas was also held by\nDescartes (Ideas, 26ff.). This claim has puzzled philosophers\nfrom Thomas Reid to the present. (Reid 1785, 169.) A good example of\nthe more common interpretation of Descartes’ theory is provided\nby Ian Hacking, who also attributes the theory, as he understands it,\nto the Port-Royal Logic. Hacking begins with the first\nsentence of the First Part of the Logic: “We have no\nknowledge of what is outside us except by the mediation of\nthe ideas within us,” and continues, “The Cartesian ego\nhas set the stage. The ego able to contemplate what is within it\nponders what lies outside …There are some objects that we can\ncontemplate without being logically committed to the existence of\nanything other than the ego. These objects are ideas.” Borrowing\nan example from Elizabeth Anscombe’s comment on Berkeley,\nHacking says that in the Cartesian (and Port-royalist) theory,\n“Ideas [in the mind] are paradigm ‘objects’ and\ncoins [in a man’s pocket] are not” (Hacking 1975b,\n28–30). But the sentence that Hacking quotes from the First Part\nof the Logic does not demand the interpretation he gives it.\nIt is consistent with the position Arnauld develops in Ideas\n(published in the same year as the fifth and last edition of the\nLogic), according to which ideas are primarily perceptions of\nexternal objects distinct from the perceiver, objects.like coins in a\nman’s pocket; and only secondarily objects of reflexive\nperception. Arnauld makes a good case for the claim that this position\nwas also held by Descartes, but the claim is not universally\naccepted. \nArnauld’s account of clarity and distinctness, obscurity and\nconfusion of ideas can be found in the First Part, Chapter 9, of the\nLogic. The discussion proceeds by way of examples, rather\nthan general definitions, but it can be summarized as follows: The\nbasic properties of ideas are clarity and confusion. Clarity of ideas\nis the same as vividness, and this is a matter of degree; the opposite\nof clarity is obscurity. Confusion of ideas results when a number of\nideas are connected by false judgments, and confusion produces\nobscurity. Opposite to confusedness of ideas is distinctness. Arnauld\nand Nicole apply these distinctions to the idea of pain: “We can\nsay that all ideas are distinct insofar as they are clear, and that\ntheir obscurity derives only from their confusion, just as in pain the\nsimple sensation which strikes us is clear and also distinct. But what\nis confused, namely that the sensation is in the hand, is by no means\nclear in us” (Logic, 48). Again, Arnauld and Nicole\nspeak of “the obscure and confused ideas we have of sensible\nqualities, the soul adding its false judgments to what nature causes\nus to know” (Logic, 49–50). The simple idea of\npain, for example, is a clear and distinct idea of a sensory state in\nthe mind, and the idea of the pain in the hand is a compound and\nconfused idea of something in the hand that exactly resembles pain.\nBeing confused, the idea is also obscure, because what it is in the\nhand that exactly resembles pain is “by no means clear to\nus.” \nThese comments on the idea of pain are part of a larger position on\n“ideas of sensation.” In a famous passage in the\n“Fourth Objections,” Arnauld objected to Descartes’\nstatement, “If cold is merely the absence of heat, the idea of\ncold which represents it to me as a positive thing will be materially\nfalse” (Descartes, 2:145). As part of his reply,\nDescartes says, “If cold is simply an absence, the idea of cold\nis not coldness itself as it exists objectively in the intellect, but\nsomething else, which I erroneously mistake for this absence, namely a\nsensation which in fact has no existence outside the intellect”\n(Descartes, 2:163). Arnauld developed a general account of\nsensory ideas that builds on this part of Descartes’ reply. He\nsets out his account clearly in Ideas: Sensory ideas, like\nthe idea of pain and the idea of cold, are perceptions of mental\nstates. Taken apart from the judgments in which we falsely identify\nthese mental states with states of material things, sensory ideas are\nclear and distinct. They become confused, and hence obscure, only as a\nresult of the precipitous, false judgments of childhood. Arnauld\nquotes Descartes’ Principles of Philosophy, Part I, #68\nin support of his account: “We know pain, color and the other\nsensations clearly and distinctly when we consider them simply as\nthoughts, but when we would judge that color, pain, etc., are things\nwhich subsist outside our thought, we do not conceive in any way what\nthat color, that pain, etc., is” (Quoted by Arnauld in\nIdeas, 132). \nArnauld’s theory of clear and confused ideas implies that ideas,\nas they are given to us by nature, and thus by God, are clear and\ndistinct, and therefore cannot be deceptive, or “materially\nfalse.” Any deceptiveness in our ideas derives from their\nconfusedness and is the result of our misuse of freedom. It is not God\nwho confuses us, but we who confuse ourselves. \nArnauld also gave a distinctive interpretation of Descartes’\nmethod of doubt. In the “Fourth Objections,” Arnauld\noffers, as the first of “the problems which a theologian might\ncome up against in the work as a whole,” the following: “I\nam afraid that the author’s somewhat free style of\nphilosophizing, which calls everything into doubt, may cause offence\nto some people” (Descartes, 2:151). Arnauld recommends\nthat the First Meditation be “furnished with a brief preface\nwhich explains that there is no serious doubt cast on these matters\nbut that the purpose is to isolate temporarily those matters which\nleave room for even the ‘slightest’ and most\n‘exaggerated’ doubt,” and that the clause\n“since I did not know the author of my being” be replaced\nby “since I was pretending that I did not know the author of my\nbeing.” \nArnauld was asking Descartes to make clear that his method did not\ninvolve real doubt, but only a consideration of what would happen\nif one were to doubt. Consider this passage from the\nPort-Royal Logic: “If there were people able to doubt\nthat they were not sleeping or were not mad, or who could even believe\nthat the existence of everything external is uncertain … at\nleast no one could doubt, as St. Augustine says, that one exists, that\none is thinking, or that they are alive… From this clear,\ncertain, and indubitable knowledge one can form a rule for accepting\nas true all thoughts found to be as clear as this one appears to\nbe” (Logic, p.\n 228).[5]\n This is as close as Arnauld comes to using methodic doubt, but it\ndoes not imply that one can really doubt the existence of an external\nworld, much less that one ought to do so, even once in one’s\nlifetime. \nIt is not clear to what extent Descartes would have agreed with that\ninterpretation of methodic doubt. He did not adopt the first of\nArnauld’s two suggested revisions. Perhaps he thought that the\npoint was covered in the “Synopsis” of the\nMeditations. But he did adopt Arnauld’s second\nrecommendation by adding some words in parentheses in the Sixth\nMeditation, thus: “The second reason for doubt was that since I\ndid not know the author of my being (or at least was pretending not\nto), I saw nothing to rule out the possibility that my natural\nconstitution made me prone to error even in matters which seemed to me\nmost true” (Descartes, 2:53). On the other hand,\nDescartes begins the Principles of Philosophy with the\nremark, “It seems that the only way of freeing ourselves from\nthese [prejudices of childhood] is to make the effort, once in the\ncourse of our life, to doubt everything which we find to contain even\nthe smallest suspicion of error” (Descartes, 1:193).\nHere Descartes advocates an effort to develop a real doubt on a wide\nscale, the sort of advocacy that had aroused Arnauld’s\ntheological concern in the “Fourth\n Objections.”[6] \nIn sum, Arnauld adopted the Cartesian method that seeks to develop\nclear and distinct ideas and to limit assent to what is represented by\nthem. But he gave his own distinctive interpretation of the key\nconcepts in the method, and eliminated from it anything that he saw as\nbeing theologically dangerous. \nIf there is one part of Descartes’ philosophy that met with\nArnauld’s enthusiastic approval, it is Descartes’\nmind-body dualism. Yet even here Arnauld’s version of the\nCartesian philosophy departed in important ways from Descartes’\nown views. Arnauld’s departure did not have to do with the\ndistinction between mind and body; here he largely contents himself\nwith endorsing what Descartes\n says.[7]\n It had to do rather with the union of the mind and body in a human\nbeing. Arnauld rejected a claim at the core of Descartes’\nposition, namely, that the union of a person’s mind and body\nmakes it possible for the mind and the body to exercise real causal\naction on one another. Arnauld explicitly says that a person’s\nbody cannot act causally on his mind, and had at least some difficulty\nwith the notion that a person’s mind can act causally on his\nbody. \nIn 1680 Arnauld wrote an extended defense of the “the philosophy\nof Descartes” regarding “the essence of body and the union\nof the soul with the body,” against an attack by Fr. Etienne Le\n Moine.[8]\n Throughout this work, Arnauld quotes Malebranche as representative of\nthe Cartesian position, and what he defends under the heading,\n“the philosophy of Descartes,” is actually a modified\nversion of\n Malebranche.[9]\n According to the Cartesian philosophy, says Arnauld, “All the\nunion (alliance) of the mind and the body which is known to\nus consists in a natural and mutual correspondence of thoughts in the\nsoul with traces in the brain and of emotions in the soul with\nmovements of the [animal] spirits.” “It is not\ndenied,” he adds, “that there may be something unknown to\nus in the union God has brought about between our soul and our\nbody”; what we do know, however, suffices to show that the mind\nis not related to the body as a pilot to his ship, but rather that the\ntwo are united in “a greater and more intimate union” by\nwhich they form a single whole (Examen, OA,\n38:141). \nArnauld next takes up a criticism raised by Le Moine against the\nCartesian account of sense perception, and this leads to the question,\n“whether it is the bodily movements [in the eye] that cause the\nperceptions in the soul; or whether they are only the occasion on\nwhich the soul forms [the perceptions] in itself; or whether God gives\n[the perceptions] to [the soul]” (Examen, OA,\n38:146). Arnauld says that it is “easy” to eliminate the\nfirst alternative: “For since the motion of a body can at best\nhave no other effect than to move another body (I say at best\nbecause it may have not even that), who does not see that it can have\nno effect on a spiritual soul?” He adds that St. Augustine\nconsidered it beyond doubt that a body can have an effect only on our\nbody, and not on our soul. Arnauld rules out the second of his three\nalternatives on the grounds that the soul cannot form sensible\nperceptions in itself on the occasion of particular motions in the\nbodily sensory apparatus because the soul is not aware of those\nmotions. This leaves Arnauld with the third alternative, which he\naccepts, adding that God voluntarily undertakes to cause in our soul\nperceptions of sensible qualities whenever the corresponding motions\noccur in the sensory organs “according to the laws He himself\nhas established in nature” (Examen, OA,\n38:148). He summarizes this conclusion by saying that our body does\nnot act on our soul as a “physical cause (cause\nphysique)” but only as a “moral cause (cause\nmorale)” (Examen, OA, 38:150). \nArnauld had a quite different position regarding the causation of\nvoluntary movements in the body. He held that, in general, it is\npossible for immaterial, thinking beings to act causally on material\nthings, and that, in fact, God has on occasion given angels the power\nto do so. He also held that the mind of Adam and of Eve had the power\nto bring about voluntary motions in their bodies before the Fall, and\nthat the minds of the blessed in heaven will enjoy that power. He\nsuggests that the voluntary bodily motions of human beings in this\nlife here below are not caused by the person’s volitions. His\nreason for this negative position is that post-lapsarian human beings\ndo not know how to bring about the movements of the animal spirits\nthat cause the motions of their muscles and limbs. Thus he says,\n“If one can say [that God has not given our soul a real\npower to determine the course of the animal spirits toward the muscles\nof the parts of our body that we want to move], it is not [on the\ngrounds of a general occasionalism like Malebranche’s]…\nIt is only because our soul does not know what must be done in order\nto move our arm by means of the animal spirits” (My italics;\nDissertation sur les Miracles de l’ancienne loi,\nOA, 38:690). Steven Nadler cites this text while arguing that\nArnauld was an “occasionalist” both about the causation of\nsensory perceptions by bodies, and about the causation of voluntary\nmovements by the human mind (Nadler 1995, 138). Nadler recognizes that\nArnauld had quite different attitudes toward the two cases, but\nnevertheless says that Arnauld “alone among Cartesians”\nrecognized mind-body interaction as a specific problem in\nDescartes’ metaphysics, and “used an occasionalist\nsolution” (Nadler 1995, 144). \nArnauld’s treatment of the union of mind and body shows that he\nwas not a docile follower of Descartes, and indeed was prepared to\ndevelop “the philosophy of Descartes” in ways that\nDescartes would probably not have accepted. It also shows that Arnauld\nwas prepared to modify Descartes’ philosophy in a way that\nincreased its similarity to Augustine. It is well known that Arnauld\npointed out similarities between Augustine and Descartes from the\nbeginning of his published work, in the “Fourth\nObjections.” In the present case, however, Arnauld changes the\nphilosophy of Descartes in a way that increases its similarity to\nAugustine. Arnauld did not mention Aquinas, though he could have done\nso, as another authority who held that a material thing cannot produce\nan immaterial effect. It was only a few years later, in On True\nand False Ideas, that Arnauld began to claim an affinity between\nthe views of Descartes and those of Aquinas. But in his development of\nthe Cartesian position on the union of mind and body, one can already\nsee Arnauld attempting to make of Descartes a Christian philosopher\nstanding in continuity with his great patristic and scholastic\npredecessors. This attempt on Arnauld’s part is explored in the\njournal Dix-Septieme Sciecle, 2013/2 no. 259.  \nThere is a continuing discussion of Arnauld’s attitude toward\nthe view which Descartes expressed in answer to Mersenne’s\nquestion “by what kind of causality God established the eternal\ntruths.” Descartes replied, “by the same kind of causality\nas he created all things, that is to say, as their efficient and total\ncause” (Descartes, p.\n 25).[10]\n The debate has been greatly influenced by Jean-Luc Marion’s\ninterpretation, in La théologie blanche de Descartes,\naccording to which Descartes’ position on the matter is\nfundamental to his metaphysics. Consequently, to the extent that\nArnauld, in his mature writings, adopted Descartes’ metaphysics,\nit has seemed reasonable to say that Arnauld agreed with Descartes\nabout “the creation of the eternal truths.” Various\nattempts have been made to to explain why Arnauld never made his\nposiiton explicit. The discussion is complicated by the difficulty of\ninterpreting Descartes’ own view. \nNicolas Malebranche was born in 1638, when Arnauld was twenty-six\nyears old. In 1660, Malebranche joined the Oratory, a center for\npriests in Paris that had many connections with Port-Royal.\nMalebranche and Arnauld were on friendly terms in the early 1670s, but\nlate in the decade they had a falling out over Malebranche’s\nexplanation of the fact that not all men are saved, and related\n matters.[11]\n In 1680, Malebranche published his position, against Arnauld’s\nadvice, in the Treatise of Nature and Grace (hereinafter\nTNG). The ensuing public controversy between the two was a\ncentral event in the intellectual life of Europe in the late\nseventeenth century. \nArnauld’s attack on TNG began in a surprising way, with\nthe publication of On True and False Ideas in 1683. In it,\nArnauld presents his own position on the nature of ideas, which was\ndescribed above, and argues that Malebranche’s view that we see\nall things (or at least all bodily things) in God and by means of\nGod’s ideas is not only mistaken, but thoroughly confused and\nwrong-headed. This work engendered a preliminary debate that lasted\nfor two years. The publication of Réflexions in\n1685–86, preceded in 1685 by the publication of Arnauld’s\n Dissertation sur les miracles de l’ancien loi,\nprovoked further exchanges between the two in 1687, with a last gasp\non Arnauld’s part in 1694, the year of his death, and on\nMalebranche’s part ten years later, in\n 1704.[12] \nTNG provides a general account of God’s reasons for\ncreating a world with the evils that the world contains. But\nMalebranche is mainly interested in one particular evil, namely, that\nnot all men are saved. That not all men are saved he took to be a\ndatum of revelation, plainly expressed in the Scriptures. But he\ndenied that it follows that God does not want all men to be saved.\nIndeed, he says his motive in writing TNG was to refute those\nwho concluded that God did not have a “sincere will” to\nsave all men: \nIf God wants to save all men, something must prevent Him from doing\nwhat He wants to do. In the “Troisième\nEclaircissement” to TNG, Malebranche says that\nsince God is omnipotent, He can bring about whatever He wants to bring\nabout. But because His will is “the love He bears for His own\nattributes,” He cannot, by a “practical”\n will,[14]\n will anything or will in any way that is not wise: “The wisdom\nof God renders Him impotent in this sense that it does not permit him\nto will certain things, or to act in certain ways” (OM,\n5:180). What prevents God from carrying out His will to save all men,\nMalebranche concludes, must be that doing so would require ways or\nmanners of willing that are unwise. As he puts it a few pages later,\nGod’s wisdom “holds His volitions in check, in the sense\nthat not all of His volitions are practical volitions”\n(OM, 5:184). \nMalebranche argues that God’s wisdom restrains Him from\nsanctifying and saving all men because it directs Him not only to\ncreate a world that is good, but also to create “in a way worthy\nof Him, by ways (par des voyes) that are simple, general,\nconstant, and uniform” (OM, 5:49). More precisely,\nGod’s wisdom directs Him to an act of creating that best\ncombines goodness or perfection of the created world with simplicity\nof ways of creating. An analogy may help explain Malebranche’s\nposition. Suppose that someone sets out to buy a car and wants to do\nthe best possible job of car-buying. Suppose further that the\nsecond-best car is available at a much better price than the best car.\nIn this case, doing the best job of car-buying might require buying\nless than the best car. In a somewhat similar way, Malebranche holds\nthat the best job of creating, the one most worthy of God, involves\ncreating a world less perfect than He might have made it, in\nparticular, a world in which not all human beings are saved. \nMalebranche’s notion of the simplicity of God’s ways of\ncreating depends on his occasionalism. According to that theory of\nefficient causality, God is the only true efficient cause. When\ncreatures appear to be efficient causes, they are really only\noccasional causes. That is, the events in which the apparent created\ncauses take part are followed by other events in accordance with laws\nof nature, which are God’s general volitions. But the created\n“causes” do not really cause the events that follow. These\nevents, like every created reality, are really caused by\n God.[15]\n For Malebranche, the simplicity of God’s ways depends on there\nbeing a small number of laws of nature, and on there being few\nexceptions to the laws. Malebranche maintains that in order to do the\njob of creating that best combines goodness of the world created with\nsimplicity of ways of creating, God had to make a world with precisely\nthe natural evils (misshapen animals, human suffering, ugly\nlandscapes, etc.) that that are present in the world as it is. \nThe anomalies in the order of grace are explained in a similar way.\nMalebranche divides grace, the divine assistance given to human\nbeings, into two kinds, which he calls “grace of light\n(lumière)” and “grace of feeling\n(sentiment)” (OM, 5:96–97; 131). The\nformer is, quite simply, knowledge. Malebranche also calls it\n“the grace of the Creator,” because it is given, in\ndifferent forms, both to Adam and Eve and to human beings after their\nFall. Grace of feeling is “the grace of Jesus Christ,” and\nwas merited for human beings by the life and death of Jesus.\nMalebranche also describes it as a “pleasure\n(délectation)” which makes a person love God\n(TNG, OM, 5:135). According to Malebranche, the\ngrace of the Creator is “dry, abstract, entirely pure and\nentirely intelligible” and does not lead us to love God. The\ngrace of Christ, in contrast, is “efficace par\nelle-même” in that it “always has its effect, always\ncarries us toward God” (OM, 5:132). Human beings, after\nthe fall of Adam, are unable to grow in holiness, or even to be saved\nfrom damnation, without the grace of Christ. But the love of God\nproduced by grace is a sort of instinctive love, which is not\nmeritorious and is not sufficient for salvation. Whether the person\nwho receives the grace of Christ is saved depends on the\nperson’s free consent to the movement toward God that grace\nproduces, which converts the instinctive love of God into a\n“free and rational” love. This consent is not produced by\ngrace. \nNow Malebranche holds that God could give to each person grace that\nwould assure the person’s salvation: “God is the master of\nhearts. He can give to the impious a grace such that it will convert\nhim, since God knows what degree of grace to give, and when it must be\ngiven, in order that it bring about the conversion of the\nsinner” (OM, 5:186). Similarly, God knows what sort of\ngrace would ensure that any person is not only saved, but also attain\nthe maximum holiness of which he or she is capable. But many who\nreceive grace do not grow in holiness and are not saved. For example,\nmany who enter the Church later fall away. On the other hand, many\nfail to receive the grace that would ensure their holiness or even\ntheir salvation. For Malebranche, this is a troubling disorder in the\ndistribution of grace parallel to the disorder found in nature:\n“God often distributes graces, without their having the effect\nthat His goodness makes us believe He would make them have. He makes\nthe piety of some people increase right up to the end of their life,\nbut sin overcomes them at death and throws them into Hell. He makes\nthe rain of grace fall upon hardened hearts as well as on earth that\nis prepared: people resist it and make it useless for their salvation.\n… How can that be reconciled with wisdom?” (OM,\n5:48) \nMalebranche’s answer is that God’s wisdom dictates that He\nact, in the distribution of both sorts of grace, according general\nvolitions determined by created occasional causes to particular\neffects. In the case of the grace of the Creator, the general\nvolitions are laws of nature and the occasional causes are “the\ndiverse movements of our will” and “the encounter of\nsensible objects that act on our mind” (TNG, 5:102).\nFor the grace of Jesus Christ, the occasional cause if Jesus Christ,\nin his human nature, and the general volition is that grace be given\nto human beings if and only if Jesus Christ, in his human nature, asks\nthat it be given. Jesus’ requests for grace are made in view of\nthe needs of the Church. But Jesus, in his human nature, does not\nalways think of “the future determination of the will” of\nthose for whom he requests grace. The result is that, often enough,\npeople receive grace that does not lead to their holiness and\nsalvation, or fail to receive the grace that would have done so\n(TNG, OM, 5:83). \nArnauld thought that Malebranche’s position was dangerous, and\nthat if accepted it would have ruinous consequences for the Catholic\nfaith. He was “furious,” as Denis Moreau has aptly said,\n“and decided to leave nothing standing in a philosophy that\nclearly frightened him” (Moreau 1999, 240). Here only the\ngeneral lines of Arnauld’s attack are clarified. First, two\npervasive themes in Arnauld’s criticism are described: (1) that\nMalebranche often did not proceed by the proper method of either\nphilosophy or theology; and (2) that Malebranche speaks of God in\nanthropomorphic terms, as if He were subject to the limitations of a\nhuman\n agent.[16]\n Then we turn to Arnauld’s main criticisms of\nMalebranche’s position that God acts vis-a-vis creatures by\n“general volitions.” \n1. Throughout Réflexions, beginning with the\n“Avant-Propos” to the work, Arnauld challenges Malebranche\nto make clear whether his claims are based on reason or on Scripture\nand\n tradition.[17]\n He had mounted this sort of challenge even earlier, in\nIdeas: “He does not say that he learned those grand\nmaxims on which all of that [Treatise of Nature and Grace]\nturns by the revelation of God: that if God wills to act\nexternally, it is because He wills to obtain an honor worthy of\nHimself; that He acts by the simplest ways; that He does not act by\nparticular volitions; but by general volitions which are determined by\noccasional causes” (Ideas, 174). Nor could all of\nthose maxims be demonstrated, in Malebranche’s sense of the\nterm, for Malebranche says that only necessary truths can be\ndemonstrated, and yet he admits that God does sometimes act by\nparticular volitions, namely, when He performs miracles. Hence\nMalebranche himself would have to admit that the third maxim, at\nleast, is not demonstrable. In Arnauld’s view, Malebranche came\nto accept such principles because he thought they made God more\nloveable and hence were favorable to the cause of religion. Thus he\nintroduces, on the basis of religious considerations, principles that\nare not found in Scripture and tradition. \nArnauld thought that this unholy introduction of religion into what\nought to be treated as philosophical questions began with\nMalebranche’s theory of ideas, according to which “we see\nall things in God.” Thus, in the “Conclusion” of his\nDéfense contre la Réponse au livre des vraies et des\nfausses Idées (OA, hereafter\nDéfense), Arnauld takes up “two or three\nobjections” that might be raised against Ideas. The\nsecond objection is one that had been raised by Nicole: “I could\nhave avoided this philosophical topic [of the nature of ideas] so as\nnot to interrupt what I had begun to write about the Treatise of\nNature and Grace.” In reply, Arnauld says, “What was\nat the outset a question of philosophy … is not such for\n[Malebranche]. For him it is a question of theology, very sublime and\nvery elevated. He considers it a religious duty to devote his whole\nmind to its defense. He finds it bad that others should disagree with\nhim, and even says that anyone who is not of his opinion must be\n‘either an unenlightened philosopher or a man insensitive to his\nduties.’ Thus he has changed the form of the dispute. He has\ninvolved religion, and has become so devoted to his novel thoughts as\nto hold that anyone who does not approve of them lacks respect for the\nwisdom of God Himself” (Défense, OA,\n39:666). \nIn Arnauld’s direct attack on TNG, he says again and\nagain that Malebranche relies on principles that have neither a proper\ntheological basis in Scripture and tradition, nor a proper\nphilosophical basis in reason. Clearly he thought that this criticism\napplied as well to Malebranche’s theory of ideas. But if Arnauld\ntook seriously the remark at the beginning of the Logic,\n“The reflections we can make on our ideas are perhaps the most\nimportant part of logic, since they are the foundation of everything\nelse,” he may well have thought that Malebranche’s theory\nof ideas was an important source of the confusion of theology with\nphilosophy that plagues TNG. That, in turn, would help to\nexplain his decision to begin his attack on TNG with a\ntreatise on the nature of\n ideas.[18] \n2. Arnauld agreed with Malebranche that God’s will is\nreasonable, but he disagreed with Malebranche’s way of\nconceiving God’s\n reasonableness.[19]\n In both Book I and Book II of Réflexions, he tries to\nshow that Malebranche conceives of God’s reasonableness as if it\nwere the reasonableness of a human being. In the second chapter of\nBook I, he reports a series of arguments given by Malebranche early in\nTNG for the conclusion that God acts in the order of nature\nonly by general volitions. These arguments, says Arnauld, are\n“only comparisons with men, which … cannot prove anything\nwith regard to God; or popular thoughts not worthy … of a\nphilosopher” (OA, 39:188). For example, Malebranche\nsays that God decides to create that which can be produced and\nconserved by the simplest laws because he is an excellent workman, and\n“an excellent workman … does not do by complicated ways\nwhat he could carry out by simpler ones” (TNG,\nOM, 5:28). Arnauld objects that there is no similarity\nbetween an excellent human workman and God, “since all the ways\nof executing His plans are equally easy for Him, and ‘His\npower,’ as the author [Malebranche] recognizes, ‘makes Him\nso much the master of all things, and so independent of help from\nelsewhere, that it suffices that He will, in order for His volitions\nto be carried out’ (OA, 39;189–90). Hence\nGod’s volitions are not based on reasoning about the means to\nachieve a desired end. \nBook II of Réflexions, which deals with God’s\nway of acting in the order of grace, opens with a related criticism.\nArnauld begins by analyzing a line of thought that Malebranche\npresents in the ”Troisième\nEclaircissement“ to TNG ” (OA,\n39:425–51). The line of thought begins with two claims: that\n“God can act only for Himself. If He wills to act, it is because\nHe wills to procure an honor worthy of Himself” and that\n“God can receive an honor worthy of Himself only from\nHimself.” Yet I am created, so I must be able to render to God\nan honor worthy of Him. This I can do, says Malebranche, only by\nbecoming a part of the Church, of which the Incarnate Second Person of\nthe Trinity is the cornerstone. More generally, “God’s\ngreat plan is to build in His own honor a spiritual temple, of which\nJesus Christ is the cornerstone … His plan is that this Temple\nshould be as large and perfect as possible.” Malebranche then\ndraws an important conclusion: “God wills that all men enter\ninto this spiritual building, to enlarge it. God wills that all\nmen be saved … God also hopes that men will merit\noutstanding degrees of glory: His will is our\nsanctification” (OM, 5:183). But although God\nwants the salvation and sanctification of all men, “He loves His\nwisdom infinitely more,” and His wisdom requires that He act in\nthe way that is wisest and most worthy of Himself, that is, in\n“general, constant and uniform way,” with the result that\n“He does not save all men, although He truly wills that they all\nbe saved” (OM, 5:185). \nArnauld has much to say against that line of thought, and he begins be\nattacking its very first step, the claim that God “can act\nexternally only in order to procure an honor worthy of Himself”\n(OA,\n 39:428–40).[20]\n He objects that this is not a proper way to speak about an infinitely\nperfect being. Once again, Malebranche is guilty of anthropomorphism.\nFor he says, in effect, “that [God] could resolve to create me,\nme and the other creatures, only for some advantage He wanted to\nobtain for Himself by creating us…. That is how [Malebranche]\nlowers [God], by claiming that He cannot decide to create anything\nexternally, except to procure an honor worthy of Himself”\n(OA, 39:429). Arnauld goes on to contrast Malebranche’s\nway of describing God’s creation with that of St. Thomas, who\nsay that the reason God creates is that His goodness tends to overflow\nand communicate itself to other\n things.[21] \nArnauld also says that to speak about God as consulting His\nwisdom before acting is to speak about God as one would about a human\nbeing who wills an end and is thereby caused to will the means to that\nend (OA, 39:432). It is to compare God to a man who consults\nhis wisdom about everything he wants to do “as if he were afraid\nof not acting well, and his will needed to be ruled by something other\nthan itself in order to do only what is good” (OA,\n39:599–600). “Is it an expression of rigorous\nexactitude to say of God that He consults His wisdom,\nand that is how it comes about that everything He wills is\nwise,” Arnauld asks, “as if the word consult is\nsuitable for an infinitely perfect being when one professes not to\nspeak in popular language? As if God needed to consult His wisdom so\nthat what He wills should be wise? As if His will were not His wisdom?\nAs if everything He wills were not essentially wise, by virtue of the\nfact that He wills it?” (OA, 39:578). God’s will\nis not a force that needs to be tamed. The truth, according to\nArnauld, is that it is impossible that God should have an actual\n(sincere) will for something that is not in fact wise. \nIn a related criticism, Arnauld chides Malebranche for allowing\n“very little freedom and indifference” in God’s\ncreative action. Arnauld quotes Malebranche: “Assuming that God\nwills to produce outside of Himself a work worthy of Himself, He is\nnot indifferent in the choice; He ought to produce\nthe most perfect work possible by relation to the simplicity of the\nways by which He acts; He owes it to Himself to follow the rules of\nhis wisdom” (Quoted by Arnauld at Réflexions,\nOA, 39:598, from TNG, OM, 5: 110).\nMalebranche tries to save for God at least freedom and indifference\nwith regard to creating or not creating. But Arnauld suggests that\nthis move is ruled out by “the way in which he conceives\nGod’s action,” for supposedly, on Malebranche’s\nview, God would consult His wisdom before deciding whether to create\nor not, and just as His wisdom advises Him to create this world rather\nthan a less perfect one, assuming that the two could be created in an\nequally simple way, His wisdom would also advise Him that it is better\nto create than not to create (OA,\n 39:599–600).[22] \nArnauld devoted much of Réflexions to\nMalebranche’s position that God acts by general volitions and\nnot by particular volitions. In Book I of Réflexions,\nhis focus is on the order of nature and he tries to show that\nMalebranche’s claim that God acts only by general volitions is\nconfused and even self-contradictory. In Book II, his focus is on the\norder of grace and he attacks Malebranche’s claim that God does\nnot distribute grace by particular volitions. \nArnauld begins his criticism in Book I by claiming that Malebranche\nconfuses acting by general volitions and acting according\nto general laws. Arnauld grants that God acts according to\ngeneral laws. But against the claim that God acts by general\nvolitions, he provides an argument that is simple, and, his view,\ndecisive: “Whatever [God] does, He does in particular, and not\nin general. But since to will and to do, in God, are the same\nthing, given that He creates each soul by a particular action, He must\nalso will to create it by a particular will” (OA,\n39:175). \nIn some passages, Malebranche’s language suggests that\nGod’s wisdom dictates that He engage in the act of creating that\nbest combines the goodness of the world created with the simplicity of\nthe laws according to which the world is created, and not\nwith simplicity of the volition whereby God creates\n(TNG, OM, 5:147). This suggests that for Malebranche\nGod does will particular created effects, though He wills that they\ntake place according to certain laws. But Arnauld did not think that\nthis was Malebranche’s view. For suppose that God creates the\nworld according to a simple set of laws. Let these laws, as regards\nbodies, be the laws of motion. A world created according to such laws\nmight be more perfect than a world not created according to general\nlaws, or created according to a different set of laws. But that would\nbe of no help to Malebranche. For he does not say that a world\nregulated by simpler laws is a more perfect world. Rather he maintains\nthat creating such a world is a simpler act of creation in God\nHimself. But it is not at all clear how simplicity of laws according\nto which the world is created would make God’s way of creating\nsimpler, especially if God’s creative activity includes the will\nto create every particular part of the creative world.\nMalebranche’s real position, according to Arnauld, emerges in\nthose passages in which he identifies the “ways” in which\nthe word is created with the actions whereby God creates. For example,\nin the passage, “An excellent workman ought to proportion his\naction to his work; he does not accomplish by highly complex ways\n(voyes) what He can execute by simpler ones” (TNG,\nOM, 5:28). To this Arnauld objects that the volitions by which\nGod creates are particular. \nArnauld next points out that Malebranche does not say, without\nqualification, that God creates by general volitions. Rather,\nMalebranche says that God’s creative will is “the cause of\na particular effect; but he calls it general, because he holds that\nGod has this will only when He is determined to have it by an\noccasional cause, which must be a creature” (OA,\n39:176). In other words, according to Malebranche, God causes\nparticular effects in creation, but the contribution of God’s\nvolition, as opposed to the contribution of created occasional causes,\nis general. Later on, Arnauld says that, on Malebranche’s view,\nit is really only the free volitions of creatures that can be said to\ndetermine God, in view of His general volitions, to produce a\nparticular effect. For, according to Malebranche, God is the cause of\nevery bodily event, including those which, together with the general\nlaws, are supposed to determine any given consequent event.\n(OA, 39:230). But Malebranche is committed, so Arnauld\nargues, to the position that the free volitions of creatures are not\ncaused by God (OA,\n 39:248–57).[23] \nArnauld goes further and says that Malebranche’s position on\nGod’s creative will is, in fact, self-contradictory. For\nMalebranche “was not of the opinion of those philosophers who\nbelieve that God originally created all things, gave them the\nqualities necessary for their conservation and the powers they needed\nin order to act, and then left them to act without further involving\nHimself.” On the contrary, Malebranche insists that “God\nis the sole cause of everything in the world, up to the smallest\nmovement of the smallest atom.” But he also holds that God\n“acts in the world only as a universal cause, whose general\nvolitions are determined by the … changes … in\ncreatures, as by so many occasional causes.” Arnauld tries to\nshow that these two positions are inconsistent with one another\n(OA, 39:231–37). \nNear the end of Book II of Réflexions, Arnauld takes\nup Malebranche’s arguments for the claim, “God does not\nact, in the order of grace, by particular volitions,” as\nsummarized by Malebranche in the Premier Eclaircissement to\nTNG (OA, 39:621). Malebranche says that the\nproposition in question can be proved by reason “in two ways;\nà priori & à posteriori; that is, by our\nidea of God, and by the effects of grace.” The chief “a\npriori” argument involves the claim that “to choose\noccasional causes, and to establish general laws for carrying out some\nwork, indicates an infinitely more extensive knowledge than to act by\nparticular volitions.” Arnauld retorts, “Is it something\nto be put up with, that human beings … should have the temerity\nto make themselves judges of what is a sign in God of greater\nintelligence and wisdom?” (OA, 39:624). \nArnauld quotes Malebranche’s statement, “The à\npriori proofs are too abstract to convince most people of the\ntruth I am proposing. It is more à propos to prove it\nà posteriori,” and goes on to consider the a\nposteriori arguments (OA, 39:625–43). He is less\nsarcastic in dealing with these arguments than with the a priori ones.\nHe says that there are “three or four of them, but they all\namount to the same thing: There are graces that are inefficacious, and\nthis would not occur if God gave His graces by particular\nvolitions.” He mentions three such arguments, based on the\npremise that graces are given to sinners who are not entirely\nconverted; on the premise that grace often falls upon hearts disposed\nin such a way that the grace does not bear fruit; and, finally, on the\npremise that graces given to sinners sometimes end up making them even\nmore guilty. \nArnauld assumes that these arguments have to do with “the true\ngrace of Jesus Christ, as defined by St. Augustine: Inspiratio\ndilectionis, ut cognita sancto amore faciamus, an inspiration of\nlove given to us so that we should do the good with holy\naffection.” Such grace is efficacious if it infallibly has its\neffect. But the effect in question may be either proximate\n(prochain) or remote (éloigné). As in\nthe famous example of Augustine, a grace may be efficacious in that it\nproduces the desire to be chaste, and yet not efficacious in that it\nfails to produces chastity itself. Similarly, Malebranche’s\narguments assume that “Every grace has the effect for which God\ngives it.” But once again, this phrase may refer to the effect\nfor which God gives the grace by His absolute will, or to the effect\nthat grace tends to produce by its nature and which for which God\ngives the grace by His antecedent will. Arnauld grants that if God\ngives efficacious graces by particular volitions, then there are none\nthat fail to have the proximate effect, which God intends they have by\nHis absolute will. But they may well fail to have remote effects to\nwhich they tend by their nature and which God wills only by His\nantecedent will. For example, if an efficacious grace has the effect\nthat a sinner repents, only to lapse back into sin, then the grace had\nthe proximate effect God intended it to have by His absolute will,\neven though it failed to have all the effect to which it tended by its\nnature and which God willed by His antecedent will. In this way, he\ndisposes of Malebranche’s three a posteriori arguments. \nArnauld ends Book II with a consideration of what he takes to be\nMalebranche’s master argument. It is a fourth a posteriori\nargument. He quotes from the Troisième\nEclaircissement: “There is no other way than [by saying\nthat God does not act by particular volitions] to reconcile the\nproposition in Holy Scripture, ‘God wants to save all\nmen,’ with this proposition, ‘Not all men are\nsaved’” (OA, 39:637). Arnauld rejects this\nargument mainly because, like the other three a posteriori ones, it\nassumes that “God wills, by a true volition, the salvation of\nall men, and the conversion of sinners” (OA,\n39:641). \nArnauld agreed with Malebranche that God could have brought it about\nthat all men are saved and did not do so. But he favored an\nAugustinian view that “all men” in this context means\n“all sorts of men,” that is, men of all races,\noccupations, etc. He did not entirely reject the Thomistic view that\nGod’s will for the salvation of all men is God’s\n“antecedent will” rather than His “consequent\nwill,” that is, God’s will other things being equal rather\nthan God’s will all things considered. Arnauld points out that\nMalebranche’s position might be thought to be a version of the\nThomistic one, but adds that according to St. Thomas God’s\nantecedent will is a wish rather than an absolute volition (une\nvelleité plutôt qu’une volonté absolue)\n(Réflexions, OA, 39:198, cf.\n 39:576).[24]\n Arnauld firmly rejects any notion that God wills the sanctification\nand salvation of each and every person in a strong sense of\n“will” such that His will would be carried out unless\nthere were something to prevent it, or, in Malebranche’s words,\nto hold it in\n check.[25] \nArnauld opened a different line of attack in his Dissertation sur\nles miracles le l’ancien loi. This new attack is directed\nagainst the occasionalism which is assumed in Malebranche’s\naccount of the wisdom of God’s ways of creating. In a foreword\nto the Dissertation, Arnauld says that he had completed his\ntreatment of the first two books of the Reflexions, and was\nbeginning work on the third, when he received the fourth edition of\nthe\n Treatise:[26] \nArnauld interrupted his work on the Reflexions to write the\nDissertation, which was published in 1685 together with the\nfirst chapter of Book Three of the Reflexions, a chapter\ndealing with Malebranche’s position that Jesus Christ, in his\nhuman nature, is the occasional cause of the distribution of grace.\nArnauld raises theological objections to both positions, but also\nattacks the underlying occasionalism. The Dissertation\ntouched off a rapid series of replies and ounter-replies in 1685. The\nfirst volume of Reflexions was published later in 1685, and\nthe second and third volumes in 1686.  \nArnauld begins his attack by citing the opening sentence of the\nDernier Eclaircissement, in which Malebranche says that he\nexpects his readers to agree with the principle that “God causes\n(fait) everything, and hence He communicates His power to\ncreatures only by establishing them as occasional\ncauses…” (OM, 5, 197). Arnauld adds that Malebranche\n“does not understand ‘God causes everything’ as\nordinary philosophers do, who say that the creature does not act at\nall unless God acts with it, which they call ‘concurrence’\n… But what he means when he says that God causes everything is\nthat He causes everything that one imagines the creature causes, and\nthat the creature causes nothing at all.” It is not difficult,\nArnauld says, to show that the first conjunct, so understood, is\nfalse. For “it destroys the nature of intelligent beings, who\nwould not be free if they did not, as real causes, form in themselves\nthe determination of their will toward particular\ngoods”. (As Arnauld points out, the italicized words are\nMalebranche’s.) The second conjunct of the principle is\ndispatched in a similar way: “For intelligent beings receive\nfrom God their power to form the determination of their will toward\nparticular goods. But it is not only as occasional causes but as real\ncauses that they form in themselves that determination of their\nwill” (OA, 5, 198). \nHaving established to his satisfaction that the principle “taken\ngenerally” is false, Arnauld goes on to say that there is no\nreason to deny that God has given angels power to move bodies and that\nthey are real, not mere occasional, causes of the miraculous events\nattributed to them. Again, “it is not so easy to\ndemonstrate” that our soul does not have the real power to move\nthe parts of the body to which it is united. \nIn the exchange of publications that grew out of the\nDissertation, Arnauld objects in a similar way to\nMalebranche’s use of occasionalism to explain “how grace\nacts in us without wounding [liberty]” (OM, 5, 8). In his\nexplanation, Malebranche distinguishes the effect of grace, which is\nfrom God and is not free, from the recipient’s free response,\nwhich is from the recipient and not from God. Arnauld says that\nMalebranche would have done well to heed Aquinas’s advice that\none should not distinguish “between what is from grace and what\nis from free will, as if the same thing could not be from both”\n(OA, 39, 114). \nBoth Malebranche and Arnauld continued to write about divine causality\nand human freedom in their later work. Arnauld’s late work on\nthe topic is describe in Section 6 below. Malebranche’s last\neffort on the topic was his Reflexions sur la Premotion\nPhysique, published in 1715, the year of his death. \nOn February 11, 1686, while the controversy between Arnauld and\nMalebranche was at a peak of intensity, Leibniz wrote to Landgrave\nErnst von Hessen-Rheinfels, asking that the Landgrave send Arnauld a\nsummary of “a short discourse” on “questions of\ngrace, the concourse of God and creatures, the nature of miracles, the\ncause of sin and the origin of evil, the immortality of the soul,\nideas, etc.” (The Leibniz-Arnauld Correspondence,\nDie Philosophischen Schriften von Leibniz, herausgegeben von K. I.\nGerhardt, Vol. 2, hereinafter LA, 11). The ensuing\ncorrespondence occurred at a crucial point in the development of\nLeibniz’s philosophy. The Discourse on Metaphysics, the\nfinal version of the short discourse, marks the beginning of\nLeibniz’s mature metaphysics, and it shows the influence of the\ncorrespondence with Arnauld. \nLeibniz had corresponded with Arnauld some fifteen years earlier, in\nconnection with Leibniz’s efforts to reunite the Christian\nchurches. These efforts took a new turn in March, 1672, when Leibniz,\nthen just 25 years old, left Mainz for Paris on a secret political\nmission for his patron, Baron Johann Christian von Boineburg, who was\nin turn minister to Johann Philipp von Schönborn, the Elector of\nMainz. Both men were converts from Lutheranism to Catholicism.\nLeibniz’s diplomatic mission was a failure, but he had other\nreasons for wanting to visit Paris. He was eager to enter into the\nbrilliant intellectual life of the French capital, and he stayed\nthere, with a brief sojourn in England, until 1676, making the\nacquaintance of a number of leading intellectuals. During this time,\nhe undertook for the first time the serious study of mathematics. But\nhe also continued to work toward a philosophical position that he\nhoped would help reunify the churches. \nBefore coming to Paris, he had discussed the project of reunifying the\nchurches with his patron Boineburg, and had corresponded with Arnauld,\nin 1671, about the Eucharist, proposing an account of the real\npresence that he thought would be acceptable to both Lutherans and\nCatholics. But it was Leibniz’s interest in theodicy, and\nrelated problems about justification, that flourished in Paris. There,\nin 1673, he composed Confessio Philosophi, a dialogue in\nLatin between a theologian and a philosopher that is sometimes\nreferred to as “his first theodicy.” Thirty-seven years\nlater in the Theodicy, Leibniz says, “While I was in\nFrance, I communicated to M. Arnauld a dialogue I had written in Latin\non the cause of evil and the justice of God. This was not only before\nhis disputes with R. P. Malebranche, but even before the book on\nThe Search after Truth had appeared. The principle that I\nhere maintain, that sin was permitted because it was involved in the\nbest plan for the universe, was already employed there, and M. Arnauld\ndid not seem hostile to it” (Theodicy, #211). \nSoon after Leibniz’s arrival in Paris, both Boineborg and von\nSchönborn died, and Leibniz turned for support to another\nimportant German noble and convert from Lutheranism to Catholicism,\nJohann Friedrich von Braunschweig-Lüneberg (Hannover). On 26\nMarch 1673, Leibniz wrote as follows to Johann Friedrich: \nThere is no record of any response by Arnauld to the Confessio\nPhilosophi, but when Leibniz returned to the problems of\ntheodicy, in 1686, he once again sought Arnauld’s cooperation by\nsending Arnauld the outline of the Discourse on Metaphysics\nthat was mentioned above. The outline sent to Arnauld was no more than\na list of the propositions that were to appear as the titles of the\nthirty-seven sections of the Discourse; the entire\ncorrespondence was carried out through the intermediary of\nHessen-Rheinfels; and the copies of letters received by the two major\ncorrespondents were sometimes defective. These facts, together with\nthe extreme subtlety of the philosophical contents of the letters,\nhave made interpretation of the correspondence very difficult. \nProposition 8 in Leibniz’s outline is: “In order to\ndistinguish the actions of God from those of creatures, it is\nexplained wherein consists the notion of an individual\nsubstance” (LA,8). The notion of a substance is, for\nLeibniz, the notion of a thing that acts. To explain the notion of a\ncreated individual substance, therefore, he has to explain the notion\nof a created agent, which requires that he distinguish correctly\nbetween the actions of creatures and the actions of God. Part of\nLeibniz’s account of the notion of an individual substance is\ngiven in Proposition 13: “The individual notion of each person\nincludes once and for all everything that will ever happen to\nhim,” so that “one sees in [that notion] a priori\nproofs of the truth of each event, that is, why one [event] has\noccurred rather than another” (LA, 8). The debate\nbetween Arnauld and Leibniz begins here. Proposition 13, Arnauld said\nin his first letter to Leibniz, implies that “once God decided\nto create Adam, everything that has happened since and will ever\nhappen to the human race was and is obliged to happen with a more than\nfatal necessity” (LA, 27). For example, given\nproposition 13, if Adam exists, then necessarily Adam is father of\nCain and Abel as sons, grandfather of their children,\ngreat-grandfather of their children, etc., and everything that will\never happen to all of them is already determined. \nAfter a complicated three-way exchange of letters, Arnauld withdrew\nhis complaint in a letter dated September 28, 1686. At the outset,\nArnauld assumed that according to Leibniz whatever is contained in the\nindividual notion of a person is contained there as a necessary\nproperty of the person. But in response to Arnauld, Leibniz says that\nhe does not “ask for more of a connection here” than that\nwhich obtains between an individual substance and its “external\ndenominations” (LA, p. 56). Given this understanding of\nthe way that individual notion of a person contains everything that\nwill ever happen to him, Arnauld was prepared to concede that\nLeibniz’s position did not involve fatalism (LA,\n63–64). \nArnauld adds that he continues to have difficulty with Leibniz’s\naccount of “the possibility of things” and his conception\nof God as choosing the actual world out of an infinity of possible\nworlds, a point on which Leibniz agreed with Malebranche. But Arnauld\nsays he does not want to go into that difficulty. Instead, he asks\nLeibniz to clarify his “hypothesis of concomitance or agreement\nbetween substances,” and his statement that if a material thing\nis not merely an appearance, like a rainbow, or an accidental\naggregation of parts, like a pile of stones, it must have a\n“substantial form.” Leibniz had mentioned both of these\npoints in his immediately preceding letter (LA, 64–66,\n58). According to the hypothesis of concomitance no created substance\never acts upon any other created substance. But every later state of\nany given created substance is caused by an earlier state of the same\nsubstance, and the histories of the individuals are coordinated by God\nso that they fit together into the history of the actual world.\nLeibniz also says that one substance, x, may\n“express” another substance, y, more distinctly\nthan y expresses x, and in that case, one may say\nthat x causes changes to occur in y. He uses this\nposition to explain the relation of mind and body. Arnauld asked him\nto explain his view further by applying it to the example of a man who\nfeels pain when his arm is wounded, and the example of a man wants to\ntake off his hat and raises his arm. Arnauld also raises seven\nobjections to Leibniz’s claims about substantial forms\n(LA, 66–67) and defends the Cartesian view that\nextension is the real nature of matter, which he takes to imply that\nbodies have only varying degrees of “improper unity”\n(LA, 88). \nLeibniz provided the further clarification Arnauld requested in\nseveral long letters, which drew two replies from Arnauld. Arnauld\ncontinued to find Leibniz’s position unclear. “I have no\nclear notion,” says Arnauld, “of what you mean by the word\n‘expression’, when you say that our soul expresses more\ndistinctly (all other things being equal) what pertains to its body,\nsince it is an expression even of the whole universe in a certain\nsense” (LA, 105). He takes Leibniz’s views about\nsubstantial forms to be a strange and unsuccessful attempt “to\nascribe true unity to bodies [in particular the bodies of animals]\nwhich would not otherwise have it” (LA, 107). \nArnauld’s last letter to Leibniz is dated August 28, 1687.\nLeibniz tried to get Arnauld to continue the discussion, but Arnauld\nwas fully occupied with other projects. On August 31, 1687, Arnauld\nwrote to Hessen-Rheinfels, saying, “It would be preferable if\n[Leibniz] gave up, at least for a time, this sort of speculation, and\napplied himself to the greatest business he can have, the choice of\nthe true religion… a decision that is of such importance for\nhis salvation” (LA, 110). \nEvidently Arnauld had less interest in Leibniz’s philosophy than\nMalebranche’s, and less patience with it. This is not\nsurprising, given that Arnauld considered his work in philosophy\nsubordinate to his work as a theologian. The fact that Malebranche was\na Catholic made his philosophically motivated departures from the\ntradition all the more dangerous in Arnauld’s eyes. It also gave\nArnauld some hope that he could lever Malebranche out of his position\nby pointing out its heterodox implications. Leibniz did not pose a\nsimilar danger, nor were there grounds for a similar hope in his\nregard, unless, of course, he heeded Arnauld’s advice and\nconverted to Catholicism. \nThroughout his enormously active life as a philosopher and theologian,\nArnauld was above all concerned to defend the doctrine that human\nbeings, after the fall of Adam, can perform meritorious actions, but\nonly if the actions are the result of a supernatural grâce\nefficace par elle-même. Arnauld claimed to find this\ndoctrine in the writings of Augustine; he defended Jansen’s\nversion of the doctrine against the charge of heresy, even though\nJansen’s version was significantly different from that espoused\nby Arnauld himself; and he attributed the doctrine to Aquinas. But\nArnauld, like Augustine, Aquinas, and Jansen, also held that actions\nare meritorious only if they are free. For this reason,\nArnauld is sometimes said to be a “compatibilist.” For\nexample, Robert Sleigh says, “It is worth noting that Leibniz\nand Arnauld both ascribed compatibilism to St. Thomas and that both\naccepted compatibilism as well” (Sleigh 1990, 29). \nThere is, however, a case to be made that the position Arnauld\ndefended and attributed to St. Thomas is in fact quite different from\nwhat is nowadays referred to as “compatibilism.” The\nposition is connected with Arnauld’s treatment of free will\nduring the last decade of his life, at the time when he was wrestling\nwith Malebranche’s theory of nature and grace. At that time,\nArnauld adopted the position that the human will is free when and only\nwhen it is a “potestas ou facultas ad\nopposita.” But first, it is necessary to provide some\nbackground for the notion of grâce efficace par\nelle-même. \nThe point of departure for the disputes about grace and free will in\nseventeenth-century Europe was the inconclusive ending of the\nCongregationes de Auxiliis Divinae\n Gratiae.[27]\n These were ad hoc committees of Cardinals convoked to\nresolve a dispute between the Jesuits and Dominicans about grace,\npredestination, and free will. The dispute was concerned with a work\nby the Jesuit Luis de Molina, whose lengthy title indicates the scope\nand complexity of the dispute: Concordia Liberi Arbitrii\ncum Gratia Donis, Divina Praescientia, Providentia, Praedestinatione\net Reprobatione ad Nonnullos Primae Partis Divi Thomae Articulos\n(The Agreement of Free will with the Gift of Grace, Divine\nForeknowledge, Providence, Predestination and Reprobation, according\nto several articles in the First Part of St. Thomas). The work\nwas published in 1588 and was immediately attacked by the Dominican\nschool of Salamanca, led by Domingo Bañez. The\nCongregationes were convoked by Pope Clement VIII with the\naim of resolving what had become a widespread struggle between the two\norders. His hope was frustrated; the meetings began on January 2, 1598\nand were terminated on August 28, 1607 (the feast day of St.\nAugustine!) by Pope Paul V, who declared that neither side was\nheretical and that both sides had merit. \nA central question at the meetings of the Congregationes had\nto do with the relation of supernatural grace to meritorious, free\nacts of will. It was assumed on both sides that a human being cannot\nperform a meritorious act of will without supernatural assistance from\nGod, that God sometimes gives this assistance, and that it is\nsometimes part of God’s providential plan that the recipient\nfreely cooperate and thus perform the act in question. Meritorious\nacts of will include, among others, the decision to pray, to seek\nforgiveness for past sins, and to perform a good action for the love\nof God. It was assumed by both Jesuits and Dominicans that God’s\nprovidential plan is infallibly realized. Hence both sides agreed that\nsupernatural grace is, in at least some cases, infallibly\nefficacious (Vansteenberghe 1928, #2140). The issue was\nwhether the supernatural grace in question is efficacious by\nitself, in other words, intrinsically efficacious, or\nwhether it is efficacious only by virtue of the independent, divinely\nforeknown cooperation of the one who receives the grace\n(Vansteenberghe 1928, #2154–65). Several sorts of supernatural\ngrace were distinguished. For our purposes, the most important\ndistinctions are (a) between habitual grace (especially the\ntheological virtues of faith, hope, and charity) and actual grace; (b)\nbetween external actual grace (e.g., hearing a good sermon) and\ninternal actual grace (grace consisting in internal, mental acts); and\n(c) between internal actual grace of the intellect and internal actual\ngrace of the will. The question was whether the actual grace of the\nwill that infallibly produces a meritorious act of will is efficacious\nby itself, or whether instead its efficaciousness is explained in part\nby God’s knowledge that the recipient would cooperate with the\ngrace. \nJansen and Arnauld, like Bañez, defended the position that\nactual grace of the will is sometimes intrinsically\n efficacious.[28]\n But they disagreed about the nature of such grace. According to\nBañez, efficacious grace is the supernatural counterpart of\n“physical premotion.” The elusive notion of physical\npremotion is part of a general account of God’s causation of the\nactions of creatures. According to this account, God is a cause of a\ncreature’s action by bringing about in the creature a\n“premotion” that results in the creature’s carrying\nout the action in question. For Bañez, then, the actual grace\nin question is a sort of supernatural beginning of volition that is\nproduced in the human being by God and that infallibly results in a\nmeritorious act of will. Jansen rejected this notion, arguing that it\nis an obscure hypothesis that explains nothing. He held that\nefficacious grace is, instead, a feeling of love, which he called a\n“delectatio victrix (victorious pleasure)” and\nwhich infallibly leads to a meritorious act. \nArnauld accepted neither of those views. In a work published in 1656,\nhe considers two positions on the nature of efficacious grace, in so\nfar as it is the principle of good will: “Some say that such\ngrace consists in the mercy of God and in an inherent form [in the\ncreature],” while others say that it consists “only in the\nmercy of God, which brings about (operatur) the interior\nmovement of the mind.” Arnauld says “I am not far”\nfrom the second position, which he attributes to “Bradwardine,\nEstius, Tiphanius, and many other [Thomists]” (Dissertatio\ntheologica quadripartita, OA, 20:237). \nWhen Arnauld returned to questions about efficacious grace and free\nwill toward the end of his life, he was more categorical: “The\ntrue opinion of St. Augustine, St. Bernard, and St. Thomas concerning\nactual grace, is that of Estius, who posits nothing created by God in\nthe will in between the will of God, which he calls uncreated grace,\nand the free movement of the human will which the uncreated grace\nproduces in the human will.” Jansen was “surely\nmistaken,” Arnauld adds, when he defined actual grace as a\nnon-deliberate “victorious pleasure” (Letter to du Vaucel,\n8 May 1693, OA,\n 3:636).[29]\n In a short treatise on human freedom written almost a decade earlier,\nArnauld illustrates his criticism of Jansen (without mentioning him by\nname) with an example: “Suppose that a man who is not very\ngenerous is approached by a beggar who asks him for alms. He\ndeliberates, proposes to himself the commandment of Christ, and gives\nalms for the sake of God” (De la liberté de\nl’homme, OA, 10:620). Hereinafter\nLiberté). Jansen assumes that there is a\nnon-deliberate act of victorious pleasure in between the man’s\ndeliberation and his decision to give alms for the sake of God, and\nthat this non-deliberate pleasure is the actual grace that enables him\nto act in a meritorious way. Arnauld rejects this position and instead\nidentifies the efficacious grace with God’s merciful will that\nthe man arrive at the deliberate decision to give alms for the sake of\nGod. \nYet Arnauld also assumed that the man’s decision, like any\nmeritorious act of will, was free. Arnauld’s basic position on\nthe compatibility of the intrinsic efficacy of grace with the freedom\nof the volitions produced by the grace, is that we know from Scripture\nand Tradition, supported by philosophical reflection on God’s\nomnipotence (a) that the grace of Christ is intrinsically efficacious;\nand we know “from our own experience” (b) that our\nvolitions of the relevant kind are free. Hence we know that (a) and\n(b) are consistent, even though we have “great difficulty”\nin seeing how they fit together (OA, 10:436). \nArnauld was, then, a compatibilist of sorts. The compatibilism he\nespoused, and attributed to St. Thomas, however, was limited, and\ndiffers in a number ways from the sort of position philosophers now\nlabel “compatibilism.” \n1. Arnauld was not a determinist, nor did he attribute determinism to\nSt. Thomas. Arnauld cites Aquinas (Summa Theologicae I, 19,\n3) as an authority in favor of his own view that God’s will with\nregard to creatures are not necessary (OA, 39:598). \n2. Arnauld held that freedom of human volitions is\nincompatible with the determination of the choices by laws of\nnature together with temporally antecedent events. Thus he responds to\nMalebranche’s statement that the destruction of Jerusalem by the\nRomans some seventy years after the death of Jesus was “a\nnecessary outcome of the laws of nature,” by saying, “It\nis clear … that a long series of diverse events, that depended\non an infinity of free movements of the wills of men, could have been,\nand indeed were, regulated by the providence of Him who has an\nalmighty power to move the hearts of men, and to direct them as He\npleases … But it cannot be said that it was a necessary\nconsequence of the laws of nature without degrading human beings,\nmaking them act like lower animals, and depriving them of their\nliberty, a position that has been declared anathema by the\nCouncil of Trent” (OA, 39:301). He repeats the\ncriticism a few pages later: “As I have shown above, to hold\nthat events that depended on an infinity of free volitions of human\nbeings were a necessary consequence of laws of nature is to\ndeprive human beings of their freedom, after the example of\nWycliffe” (OA,\n 39:316).[30] \n3. According to the position Arnauld attributes to Aquinas, the\nsinful choices of human beings are not determined by any\ncause exterior to the sinner. Arnauld agreed with Aquinas that God is\nthe sole exterior cause of the volitions of a human being, that is,\nthe only efficient cause of volitions outside the human being himself\nor herself, but God never causes a person to sin. Arnauld cites\nSumma Theologiae, I-IIae, 9, 6, ad 3, in which Aquinas\nanswers the objection that God cannot be the sole exterior cause of\nsinful choices. Aquinas says, “God, as the universal mover,\nmoves the will of man to the universal object of the will, which is\nthe good. And without this universal movement man cannot will\nanything; but man through reason determines himself to will this or\nthat, whether it be a true or only an apparent good. Nevertheless God\nsometimes moves some men especially to will something determinate that\nis good (interdum movet Deus specialiter aliquos ad aliquid\ndeterminatè volendum quod est bonum), as in those He moves\nby grace” (Vera S. Thomae de gratia sufficiente et efficaci\ndoctrina dilucide explanata, OA,\n 20:63).[31]\n Arnauld’s purpose in citing this text is to show that,\naccording to Aquinas, when one sins, one is not moved by\n grace.[32]\n But the text, together with the premise that there is no exterior\ncause of human volition other than God, implies that sinful choices\nare not determined by any cause outside the sinner. \nIn several letters toward the end of his life, Arnauld recommends a\n“little Latin text” on human freedom that he wrote at the\ntime he was wrestling with Malebranche’s theory of nature and\ngrace, saying that it is particularly helpful in connection with the\nproblem of reconciling intrinsically efficacious grace with freedom of\n will.[33]\n The core of Arnauld’s new theory is that the human soul has\nfreedom of will with respect to a true or apparent good when it has\nthe power to will that good and the power not to will it. In such\ncases, the soul “determines itself” to will or not will\nthe good in question. The human soul is said to have this power with\nrespect to any particular good it apprehends, as long as the\nparticular good does not encompass all the good toward which the will\ntends. Arnauld cites I-IIae, 13, 6 as part of the Thomistic origin of\nhis theory: \nArnauld follows Aquinas in saying that the will is not free with\nregard to two objects, first, happiness, apprehended as the ultimate\nobject of volition, and, second, God, seen face to face by the blessed\nin heaven. In these two cases, one wills (or loves) the object with\n“necessity of nature,” and hence not freely. In all other\ncases, the will is free, and when one wills, one does so\n freely.[34]\n Arnauld provides a compact formula for this theory: “The best\nand shortest notion one can have of free will is to say with St.\nThomas that it is potestas ou facultas ad opposita”\n(Letter to Bossuet, juillet 1693, OA,\n 3:662).[35] \nArnauld claims a number of advantages for his theory of free will over\nthat of Jansen. In particular, he claims that, when combined with the\naccount of the nature of grace that he found in Estius, it makes it\neasier to reconcile the intrinsic efficacy of grace with freedom.\n“In following [Estius’s opinion regarding efficacious\ngrace], it is much easier to explain the efficacy of the grace, and to\nreconcile it with freedom, especially when we define free will,\nfollowing St. Thomas, as a facultas ad opposita”\n(Letter to Bossuet, juillet 1694, OA, 3:664). \nExplaining the efficacy of grace is easier on Estius’s theory\nthan on the competing theories, because it is simpler. On the\ncompeting theories, which include Jansen’s, the efficacy of\nactual grace of the will depends on a connection of some sort, within\nthe mind of a creature, between a created grace, like Jansen’s\n“victorious pleasure,” and a meritorious choice.\nEstius’s theory is simpler: The efficacy of actual grace is a\ndirect consequence of the general principle that God’s absolute\nwill is infallibly realized. \nBut how does Estius’s theory, combined with the account of free\nwill that Arnauld derived from St. Thomas, help to reconcile the\nefficacy of grace with free will? According to Jansen, freedom of will\nis the same as spontaneity, and so every act of will is essentially\nfree. Jansen qualifies that position by adding that during life here\non earth, human beings have another kind of freedom: “The\nfreedom of man the pilgrim is not only exempt from constraint, but\neven from immutable voluntary necessity (necessitatis\nimmutabilis voluntariae), that it, this freedom is indifferent\nbetween doing good and doing evil, between acting and not\nacting” (Quoted by Arnauld in Seconde Apologie,\nOA, 17:242). When he says that the will is indifferent as\nbetween doing good and doing evil, and between acting or not acting,\nduring this life here below, Jansen means that during life on Earth,\nthe will remains mutable or “flexible” between doing good\nand doing evil, and again, willing or not willing any particular\naction or end. In other words, the will is not confirmed in good or\nevil during this life in such a way that it could not fall away from\nwilling the good or be converted from willing what is evil, and again\nin such a way that it could not cease willing what it does will or\nbegin willing what it does not will. \nNow on theories like those of Jansen and Bañez, the intrinsic\nefficacy of grace involves the determination of a person’s\nvolition by an antecedent state of his or her mind, and this seems to\nconflict with the proposition that the volition is free. On\nEstius’s view, on the other hand, a person’s meritorious\nvolition is determined not by an antecedent state of his or her mind,\nbut rather by the will of God. Is this an improvement, with respect to\nexplaining the compatibility of efficacious grace with free will?\nArnauld says it is, “especially when we define free will,\nfollowing St. Thomas, as a facultas ad opposita.” \nHere Arnauld appeals to the Thomistic principle that when God causes a\ncreature to act, He always causes the creature to act in accordance\nwith its nature. Paraphrasing Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, I,\n82, 1, ad 3), Arnauld says, \nArnauld’s line of thought seems to be as follows: Human beings\nare attracted to limited goods only as means to the unlimited good of\nhappiness. Therefore, whenever a human being is attracted to a limited\ngood, he or she can attend to its goodness and will it, or attend to\nsome way in which it falls short of the unlimited good and refrain\nfrom willing it. Which of these options is realized is determined by\nthe human being, or more precisely, the human being’s mind;\nthus, in willing or not willing any limited good, the human mind is\nself-determining and free. All this is part of the nature of the human\nmind. So if God moves the human mind to will a limited good, He moves\nit to will in a self-determining and free way. \nIf pressed for more details about how God by His merciful will\n(uncreated grace) moves a human being to will a particular good, while\nyet leaving it up to the human being whether he or she wills that\ngood, Arnauld would surely say that we human beings cannot understand\nGod’s causality well enough to supply such details. Our\ninability to understand God’s causality with regard to the\ncreated world is a common theme in Arnauld. It is expressed forcefully\nin his first contribution to the Leibniz-Arnauld exchange, written in\n1686, not long after Liberté. Arnauld says that\nalthough we are certain that God, “by a single and very simple\nact, which is His essence,” knows all things, including things\nthat might not have been, and wills things that He might not have\nwilled by His will, which is also His essence, nevertheless we cannot\nunderstand how God does these things, because “as far\nas we are concerned (à notre égard) God dwells\nin inaccessible light” (LA, p.\n 31–32).[37] \nBefore presenting the above theory of free will in\nLiberté, Arnauld prepares the ground by presenting two\nexamples in which a person’s volition occurs\n“infallibly” and yet freely, in the sense of freedom\n“that is necessary and sufficient for merit or demerit”\n(Liberté, OA, 10:620). The examples are preceded by\nthe statement, “However infallible be the determination by which\nthe will is determined with the attention of reason, to objects to\nwhich it is not naturally determined, freedom suffers no damage\n(préjudice); because the infallible determination does\nnot prevent the soul from willing because it wills; and hence it is\nmaster of its action” (Liberté, OA,\n10:615–16). The first example is that of a prince who is in love\nwith a woman and has “a vehement passion for the pleasures of\nthe flesh.” If the woman offers herself to the prince, “he\nwill infallibly satisfy his passion.” The second example is that\nof a cruel and revengeful king, who has been offended by one of his\nsubjects and has the subject in his power: “Infallibly he will\ndestroy\n him.”[38]\n Everyone who is not “entirely barbarian,” says Arnauld,\nwill agree that the prince and the king have acted demeritoriously and\ndeserve punishment. Thus all such people agree that the king and the\nprince acted in a relevantly free way. \nOne might take these passages to suggest that the freedom necessary\nand sufficient for merit and demerit is compatible with determination\nof the will by psychological causes. But this misses Arnauld’s\npoint, and is an unlikely interpretation. To begin with, Arnauld\nsurely realized that neither the lascivious prince nor the cruel\ntyrant infallibly act in the ways described, in any strict\nsense of the term. People do sometimes act out of character. Arnauld\nseems to think of infallibility, like its cousin, certainty, as a\nmatter of degree. This is indicated by the phrase, “However\ninfallible be the determination by which the will is determined with\nthe attention of reason …” The certainty that the cruel\nking and the lascivious prince will act in the ways indicated is so\nhigh that one would say, in a loose and popular sense of the word,\nthat infallibly the king will revenge himself and the prince\nsatisfy his passion. \nArnauld’s point is not that the actions of the prince and the\nking are causally determined by psychological states antecedent to\ntheir volitions. In both cases he says that the action is free because\nthe person could have willed not to perform the action, or again,\nbecause the person’s will was a potestas ad opposita.\nArnauld’s point is that our certainty that the prince and the\nking will act in the ways described does not lessen our certainty that\nthey will act freely. The same, he says, is true of our certainty that\na meritorious act will be carried out as a result of efficacious\ngrace, that is, as a result of God’s merciful will moving a\nperson to that act. Arnauld claims that our certainty about the\nfreedom of the act produced by efficacious grace, like our certainty\nabout the freedom of the actions of the prince and the kind, is well\ngrounded because in all of these cases, the person had the power to\nrefrain from the act in question; in all of these cases, the\nperson’s will is a facultas ad opposita. \nThere is, of course, an important difference between examples like\nthose of the prince and the king, and example of an action to which\none is moved by efficacious grace. In examples of the former sort, the\naction occurs only with very great, but not absolute, certainty,\nwhereas in the case of efficacious grace, the action follows with\nabsolute certainty upon God’s intention that it take place. This\ndifference may seem to damage Arnauld’s case: One can plausibly\nsay that it was within the power of the prince, for example, not to\nwill to satisfy his lust, precisely because it was not absolutely\ncertain that, in the given circumstances, he would do so. But no\nsimilar claim can be made about the person whom God moves, by\nefficacious grace, to elicit a meritorious volition. Yet Arnauld\ninsists that in the latter case also, it is within the power of the\nperson not to elicit the volition. It is at this point that\nArnauld’s views about the mysteriousness of divine causality\ncome into play. Our inability to understand how God moves a person to\na meritorious volition, while leaving it within the person’s\npower not to elicit the volition, thus moving the person to will in a\nself-determining way, is not, in Arnauld’s view, surprising, for\nwe are unable, in general, to understand how God produces effects\noutside of Himself. \nArnauld’s work between 1682 and 1694 is a testament to his\nintellectual vitality. It is remarkable that he was hard at work,\nuntil his death at the age of 82, on a set of connected controversies\nand issues, both philosophical and theological, having to do with\ncreation, grace, and free will. Though he did not construct a\nphilosophical system, he stands out in a century of geniuses for the\nvigorous and penetrating way in which he dealt with many of the\nimportant philosophers and philosophical problems of the time.","contact.mail":"elmar.kremer@utoronto.ca","contact.domain":"utoronto.ca"}]
