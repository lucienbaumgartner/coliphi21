As a logician, he was at the forefront of the movement that\nexpanded the analysis of language based on the properties of terms,\nespecially their reference (in Latin: suppositio), but also\nin the exploration of new fields of logic, especially the theory of\nconsequences. As a natural philosopher, he worked, along with Buridan, in the context of the new Parisian physics, contributing to its spread throughout Italy and central Europe.\n\n\n\n\nIn the later Middle Ages Albert of Saxony (Albertus de\nSaxonia) was sometimes called Albertucius (Little\nAlbert), to distinguish him from the thirteenth-century theologian\nAlbert the Great. He is however a master of great importance in his own right. He was born at Rickensdorf, in the region of\nHelmstedt (Lower Saxony) in present-day Germany, around 1316. After\ninitial schooling in his native area, and possibly a sojourn at Erfurt,\nhe made his way to Prague and then on to Paris. He was member of the\nEnglish-German Nation and became a master of arts in 1351. He was\nRector of the University of Paris in 1353. He remained in Paris until\n1362, during which time he taught arts and studied theology at the\nSorbonne, apparently without obtaining a degree in the latter\ndiscipline. His logical and philosophical works were composed during\nthis period. After two years of carrying out diplomatic missions\nbetween the Pope and the Duke of Austria, he was charged with founding\nthe University of Vienna, of which he became the first Rector in 1365.\nAppointed canon of Hildesheim in 1366, he was also named Bishop of\nHalberstadt the same year, serving in that office until his death on\nJuly 8, 1390.  \n\nNot having left any theological writings or a commentary on\nAristotle’s Metaphysics (at least none that we know of),\nAlbert is primarily known for his works on logic and natural\nphilosophy, though he also wrote commentaries on Aristotle’s\nNicomachean Ethics and Economics, as well as several\nshort mathematical texts (the Treatise on Proportions,\nQuestion on the Squaring of the Circle, Question on the\nminimum and maximum). \n\nAlbert’s masterwork in logic is a summa entitled the\nPerutilis logica (Very Useful Logic). He also composed a\nvoluminous collection of Sophismata, which examines numerous\nsentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence\nof syncategorematic words — i.e., terms such as quantifiers and\ncertain prepositions, which, according to medieval logicians, do not\nhave a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the\nsignification of the other terms in the propositions in which they\noccur. He also wrote several question commentaries:\nQuaestiones on the Ars Vetus or Old Logic (i.e., the\nIsagoge of Porphyry and Aristotle’s Categories and\nDe Interpretatione), Quaestiones on the Posterior\nAnalytics, and a series of 25 Quaestiones logicales\n(Logical Questions), addressed to semantic problems and the status of\nlogic. Of dubious authenticity are the treatises De\nconsequentiis (On Consequences) and De locis dialecticis\n(On Dialectical Topics), which have been attributed to him in a\nParisian manuscript. \n\nThe most renowned philosopher when Albert studied and taught in the\nFaculty of Arts at Paris was John Buridan. Albert was one of several masters contemporary with or immediately following Buridan whose work transformed logic and natural\nphilosophy in the later Middle Ages. For a long time he was thought to\nhave been a pupil or follower of Buridan, but this idea is now widely questioned. Some of his works on logic and physics were composed before Buridan had lectured on these subjects for the last time, and Buridan clearly takes notice of them, whether for criticizing or for adopting Albert’s views. In logic, he seems to have been influenced by certain ideas\nand methods imported from England. His logic depends very much on\nOckham’s, but the influence of William Heytesbury is also evident in\nhis\nSophismata.\nWalter Burley was another important influence on Albert, though this is\nsomewhat puzzling in view of the fact that they had opposing views on\nthe nature of universals. In any case, Burley seems to have been on\nAlbert’s mind when he wrote his commentary on the Nicomachean\nEthics as well as when he was developing his theory of\nconsequences. \n\nThese different influences have sometimes made Albert seem no more\nthan an eclectic compiler of the views of others. But, in addition to\nproviding the context for some of his own contributions, Albert’s\nfluency with the views of his contemporaries gives him a unique place\nin the development of logic and philosophy at the University of Paris\nin the fourteenth century. \n\nOn most topics the Perutilis logica (a text based on lectures first given before 1356 and finally revised for publication before 1360) is influenced by Ockham’s\nSumma logicae, though it offers an independent approach in the\ntreatises on obligations, insolubles, and consequences, which had\nassumed greater importance during this period. As has been known for\nsome time, this work is a remarkable handbook organized into six\ntreatises: the first defines the elements of propositions; the second\ntreats of the properties of terms; the third of the truth conditions of\ndifferent types of proposition; the fourth of consequences (including\nsyllogisms, and in fact adding to it the theory of topics); the fifth\nof fallacies; and the sixth of insolubles and obligations.  \n\nIn the first part of the Perutilis logica, which sets out the\nterminology of the entire text, Albert returns to the Ockhamist\nconception of the sign and in so doing distances himself from the\nposition defended by Buridan. After clearly including the term (an\nelement of the proposition) in the genus of signs — by which he\nprovides, in the tradition of Ockham, a semiotic approach to\nlogico-linguistic analysis — he establishes signification\nthrough a referential relation to a singular thing, defining the\nrelation of spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of\nsubordination. He is also an Ockhamist in his conception of universals,\nwhich he regards as spoken or conceptual signs, and in his theory of\nsupposition, which essentially restates the Ockhamist divisions of\nsupposition, despite of some refinements as descensus\ncopulatim, perhaps influenced by Heytesbury. In particular, he\nrestores the notion of simple supposition — i.e., the reference\nof a term to the concept to which it is subordinated, when it\nsignifies an extra-mental thing — which had been criticized and\nrejected by Buridan. Finally, Albert is close to the Venerabilis\nInceptor in his theory of the categories, where he refuses to consider quantity as something absolutely real,\nreducing it instead to a disposition of substance and quality. Albert\nin fact contributed as much as Ockham to the spread of this conception\nof the relation between substance and quantity in natural philosophy\nin Paris and Italy. \n\nAlbert’s treatment of relations is, on the other hand, highly\noriginal. Although (like Ockham) he refuses to make relations into\nthings distinct from absolute entities, he clearly ascribes them to an\nact of the soul by which absolute entities are compared and placed in\nrelation to each other, an “act of the referring soul [actus animae\nreferentis]”. This leads him to reject completely certain\npropositions Ockham had admitted as reasonable, even if he did not\nconstrue them in quite the same way, e.g., ‘Socrates is a\nrelation’. Both Ockham and Buridan had allowed that the term\n‘relation’ could refer to the things signified or connoted\nby concrete relative terms (whether collectively or not). \n\nSo Albert was not content with merely repeating Ockhamist arguments.\nMore often than not, he developed and deepened them, e.g., in\nconnection with the notion of the appellation of form. This property of\npredicates, which had previously been used by the Venerabilis\nInceptor, was employed by Albert in an original manner when he\nadopted it instead of Buridan’s appellation of reason (appellatio\nrationis) to analyze verbs expressing propositional attitudes.\nEvery proposition following a verb such as ‘believe’ or\n‘know’ appellates its form. In other words, it must be\npossible to designate the object of the belief via the expression\nunderstood as identical to itself in its material signification and\nwithout reformulation. Another area in which Albert deviates from\nOckham is his rejection of the idea that any distinction with multiple\nsenses must have an equivocal proposition as its object. According to\nAlbert, equivocal propositions can only be conceded, rejected, or left\nin doubt. \n\nHe adopts the same position as Burley about the issue of the complex subject-term (including an oblique case) in a categorical proposition, as in ‘Any man’s donkey is running [Cuiuslibet hominis asinus currit]’. He supports a logico-semantical model in which ‘man [homo]’ is the logical subject while ‘a man’s donkey [hominis asinus]’ is the grammatical one. He will be criticized on that point by Buridan, for whom the logical subject is always the grammatical subject. \n\nAlbert’s semantics becomes innovative when he admits that\npropositions have their own proper significate, which is not identical\nto that of their terms (see especially his Questions on the\nPosterior Analytics I, qq. 2, 7, 33). Like syncategorematic terms\n(see his Questions on the Categories, qu. 1 ‘On\nNames’), propositions signify the “mode of a thing\n[modus rei]”. This position is not repeated in the\nLogical Questions. In any case, Albert avoids hypostatizing\nthese modes by explaining them as relations between the things to which\nthe terms refer. It cannot be said here that Albert is moving towards\nthe “complexly signifiable [complexe\nsignificabile]” of Gregory of Rimini, although his remarks\nare reminiscent of the latter theory. Still, he uses the idea of the\nsignification of a proposition to define truth and to explain\n‘insolubles’, i.e., propositions expressing paradoxes of\nself-reference. On Albert’s view, every proposition signifies that it\nis true by virtue of its form. Thus, an insoluble proposition is always\nfalse because it signifies at the same time that it is true and that it\nis false. \n\nThe Questiones circa logicam (Questions on Logic)\nwere written at roughly the same time as the Perutilis logica\nand the Questiones circa artem veterem, that is to say about\n1356. They explore in a series of disputed questions the status of\nlogic and semantics on topics such as the relation of words to\nconcepts, the difference between natural and conventional\nsignification, etc., as well as the theory of reference and truth.\nAlbert defines signification by representation. He\ndistinguishes two ways of understanding suppositio, the first\nas the act of the mind itself; the second as an operation constituting one\nof the properties of terms. \n\nIn his Sophismata, Albert usually follows Heytesbury. The\ndistinction between compounded and divided senses, which is presented\nin a highly systematic way in Heytesbury’s Tractatus de sensu\ncomposito et diviso, is the primary instrument (besides the\nappellation of form) for resolving difficulties connected with\nepistemic verbs and with propositional attitudes more generally. This\nis abundantly clear in his discussion of infinity. Rather than\nappealing to the increasingly common distinction between the\ncategorematic and syncategorematic uses of the term\n‘infinite’ and then indicating the different senses it can\nhave depending on where it occurs in a proposition, he treats the\ninfinite itself as a term. Albert’s approach involves analyzing the\nlogical and linguistic conditions of every proposition involving the\nterm ‘infinite’ that is significant and capable of being\ntrue. This leads him to sketch a certain number of possible\ndefinitions (where he appears to take into account the teachings of\nGregory of Rimini), as well as to raise other questions, e.g., on the\nrelation between finite and infinite beings (in propositions such as\n‘Infinite things are finite [infinita sunt\nfinita]’), on the divisibility of the continuum, and on\nqualitative infinity. There are echoes in Albert not only of the\napproach Buridan had systematically implemented in his\nPhysics, but also of the analyses of English authors —\nagain, especially Heytesbury. As is often the case, the treatment\nproposed by Albert in the Sophismata provides good evidence\nof the extent to which philosophers were gripped by questions about\ninfinity at that time. \n\nFinally, one of the fields in which Albert is considered a major\ncontributor is the theory of consequences. In the treatise of the\nPerutilis Logica devoted to consequences, Albert often seems\nto follow Buridan. But whereas Buridan maintained the central role of\nAristotelian syllogistic, Albert, like Burley, integrated syllogistic\nand the study of conversions into the theory of consequences.\nConsequence is defined as the impossibility of the antecedent’s being\ntrue without the consequent’s also being true — truth itself being\nsuch that howsoever the proposition signifies things to be, so they\nare. The primary division is between formal and material consequences,\nthe latter being subdivided into consequences simpliciter and\nut nunc. A syllogistic consequence is a formal consequence\nwhose antecedent is a conjunction of two quantified propositions and\nwhose consequent is a third quantified proposition. Albert is thus led\nto present a highly systematic theory of the forms of inference,\nwhich represents a major step forward in the medieval theory of logical\ndeduction. \n\nIt is this analysis of language together with a particularist ontology\nthat places Albert in the tradition of nominalism. This is combined\nwith an epistemological realism that emerges, e.g., in his analysis of\nthe vacuum. In certain respects, Albert’s work is an extension of\nphysical analysis to imaginary cases. Distinguishing, as Buridan did,\nbetween what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is\nimpossible “in the common course of nature” (Questions\non De Caelo I, qu. 15), he considers hypotheses under\ncircumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given\nGod’s absolute power (e.g., the existence of a vacuum and the plurality\nof worlds). However, even if we can imagine a vacuum existing by divine\nomnipotence, no vacuum can occur naturally (Questions on the\nPhysics IV, qu. 8). Albert refuses to extend the reference of\nphysical terms to supernatural, purely imaginary possibilities. In the\nsame way, one can certainly use the concept of a point, although this\nwould only be an abbreviation of a connotative and negative expression.\nThere is no simple concept of a point, a vacuum, or the infinite, and\nalthough imaginary hypotheses provide an interesting detour, physics\nmust in the end provide an account of the natural order of things.  \n\nHistorically, Albert’s reputation in natural philosophy is at least as\nhigh as the one he had in logic. His commentaries on the\nPhysics and De caelo are close to Buridan’s, but in some questions on De generatione et corruptione he rather follows Oresme. He\nappeals to the authority of his “revered masters from the\nFaculty of Arts at Paris” at the beginning of his questions\non De caelo. Even so, it should be noted that\nhis Physics was composed soon after 1351, before the final\nversion of Buridan’s Questions on the Physics (between 1355\nand 1358). On some points we see that Buridan modifies his positions\nbetween the third and the final versions of his commentary,\nand we can presume that this is in response to Albert’s ideas. \n\nOn some other issues, the oppositions remain strong between the two\nmasters. We have already seen that on the question of the status of\nthe category of quantity, then at the border of logic and physics,\nAlbert followed Ockham and distanced himself from Buridan by reducing\nquantity to a disposition of substance or quality. This move becomes\nevident in certain physical questions, e.g., in the study of\ncondensation and rarefaction, where Albert openly disagrees with\nBuridan by arguing that condensation and rarefaction are possible only\nthrough the local motion of the parts of a body, and without needing\nto assume some quantity that would have a distinct reality on its\nown. Nevertheless, he defines the concept of a “lump of matter\n[materie massa]” without giving it any autonomous\nreality, although it does help fill out the idea of a ‘quantity\nof matter’, which Giles of Rome had already distinguished from\nsimple extension. \n\nSimilarly, Albert is sometimes seen as standing alongside Ockham on\nthe nature of motion, rejecting the idea of motion as a flux\n(fluxus), which is the position Buridan had adopted. In\ncontrast to Buridan, Albert treats locomotion in the same way as\nalteration (movement according to quality): in neither case is it\nnecessary to imagine local motion as a res successiva distinct\nfrom permanent things, at least if the common course of nature holds\nand one does not take into account the possibility of divine\nintervention. \n\nConcerning the motion of projectiles, gravitational acceleration,\nand the motion of celestial bodies, Albert adopts Buridan’s major\ninnovation, i.e., the theory of impetus, a quality acquired by\na moving body (see Buridan’s Questions on the Physics VIII,\nqu. 13, on projectile motion). Like Buridan, he extends this approach\nto celestial bodies in his commentary on De caelo, clearly\nfollowing its consequences in rejecting intelligences as agents of\nmotion and in treating celestial and terrestrial bodies using the same\nprinciples. Nevertheless, he formulates the idea of impetus in\nmore classical terms as a virtus impressa (impressed force)\nand virtus motiva (motive force). Albert makes no\npronouncements about the nature of this force, claiming that this is a\nquestion for the metaphysician. His work also mentions the mean speed\ntheorem, a method of finding the total velocity of a uniformly\naccelerated (or decelerated) body, which had been stated (though\nwithout being demonstrated) in Heytesbury’s Tractatus de motu,\nand also adopted by Nicole Oresme. Albert was part of a general\nscientific trend which sought the first formulations of the principles\nof dynamics. He explained a number of curious natural phenomena, taking\nparticular interest in earthquakes, tidal phenomena, and geology. \n\nAlbert wrote a treatise on proportions dedicated to the analysis of\nmotion, highly influenced by the treatise De proportionibus\nvelocitatum in motibus of Thomas Bradwardine. He explains in a\nsynthetic way the elements of the theory of proportions, applying this\ntheory to different motions (local motion, alteration, augmentation,\nand diminution). Motion is to be studied “from the point of view\nof the cause” and “from the point of view of the\neffect”. Like Oresme, Albert adopts the idea that motion varies\naccording to a geometrical progression when the relation of motive\nforce to resistance varies arithmetically. His treatise is less\ninnovative than Oresme’s, but it is a clear exposition that was very\nwidely read. \n\nAlbert was interested in certain\nmathematical problems. To this end, he wrote a question on the squaring\nof the circle as well as questions on John of Sacrobosco’s Treatise\non the Sphere. In addition to authoritative arguments and purely\nempirical justifications, his question on the squaring of the circle\nuses properly mathematical arguments appealing to both Euclid (in the\nversion of Campanus of Novarra) and Archimedes (translated by Gerard of\nCremona). His most original contribution is a proposal to dispense with\nEuclid’s proposition X.1, replacing it with a postulate stating that if\nA is less than B, then there exists a quantity C such that\nA<C<B. \n\nFinally, a treatise De maximo et minimo, considering the\nlimits of active and passive potencies, written in the tradition\nof the Oxford Calculators, at the frontiers of logic and natural\nphilosophy. \n\nAlbert of Saxony’s teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely\ninfluential. Although Buridan remained the predominant figure in\nlogic, Albert’s Perutilis logica was destined to serve as a\npopular text because of its systematic nature and also because it\ntakes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. But\nit was his commentary on Aristotle’s Physics that was\nespecially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France\nand Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Thanks to Albert of Saxony, many new\nideas raised in Parisian physics and cosmology in the later Middle\nAges became widespread in Central Europe. Albert’s Physics,\nmuch more than Oresme’s and even Buridan’s, basically guaranteed the\ntransmission of the Parisian tradition also in Italy, where it was\nauthoritative along with the works of Heytesbury and John\nDumbleton. His commentary on Aristotle’s\nDe caelo was also influential, eclipsing Buridan’s commentary\non this text. Blasius of Parma read it in Bologna between 1379 and\n1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna.\nHis Treatise on Proportions was often quoted in Italy where,\nin addition to the texts of Bradwardine and Oresme, it influenced the\napplication of the theory of proportions to motion.  \n\nAlbert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy\nand central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan’s\nteachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert’s own grasp of\nEnglish innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler\nof the work of others. He manifests an undeniable\noriginality on many topics in logic and physics.","contact.mail":"joel.biard@univ-tours.fr","contact.domain":"univ-tours.fr"}]
