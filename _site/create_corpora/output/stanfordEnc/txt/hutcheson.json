While Hutcheson was educated, and completed\nhis career, at the University of Glasgow, he was Irish by birth, and\nreturned to Scotland only after his major writings (including the\nInquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue,\nthe Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions, with\nIllustrations on the Moral Sense) had been published, and in some\ncases extensively revised. Nevertheless, he had a tremendous influence\non the Scottish intellectual scene, in part due to his interactions\nwith important Scottish figures of the day, including Adam Smith,\nThomas Reid, and David Hume.\n\n\nLeaving aside his influence on the Scottish enlightenment,\nHutcheson’s contribution to the broader development of modern\nBritish moralism cannot be overstated. His chief philosophical\ncontributions, upon which this entry will concentrate, include his\naforementioned sentimentalism, his complex moral\npsychology, his proto-utilitarianism, his critique of\nself-interest theorists (such as Hobbes and Mandeville), his\ncritique of rationalists (such as Clarke and Wollaston), and\nhis attempted reconciliation of virtue and self-interest.\n\n\nOne brief note. Though this entry will concentrate on\nHutcheson’s contributions to moral philosophy, Hutcheson also\noffers views on the nature of human perception (broadly derived from\nLocke’s Essay), first- and second-order theories of\naesthetics (see Kivy 1976 [2003]), logic (Hutcheson 1756),\nassociationism about human cognition (cf. Gill 1995, 1996; Kallich\n1946), religion (Elton 2008; Harris 2008), and many other topics that\nmust be foregone for lack of space.\n\n\nThis entry will proceed in two stages, the first focusing on\nHutcheson’s metaethics, including his sentimentalism and moral\npsychology; the second concentrating on his normative ethics,\nincluding his anticipation of some strains in utilitarian thought, and\nhis argument that virtue and self-interest are aligned.\n\nHutcheson’s most detailed statement of his sentimentalism and\nsubstantive moral and aesthetic theory is to be found in his 1725 (and\nsubsequently revised) work, An Inquiry into the Original of our\nIdeas of Beauty and Virtue. Indeed, at least in early editions of\nthe Inquiry, Hutcheson considered this essay an attempt to\ndefend the (broadly considered) sentimentalist doctrines of Lord\nShaftesbury, as expressed in the Characteristiks of Men, Manners,\nOpinions, Times (1711). Indeed, the subtitle of the book’s\nfirst edition runs as follows:  \nIn which the principles of the late Earl of Shaftesbury are\nExplain’d and Defended, against the Author of the Fable of\nthe Bees: and the Ideas of Moral Good and Evil are\nestablish’d, according to the Sentiments of the Antient\nMoralists. With an Attempt to introduce a Mathematical Calculation in\nSubjects of Morality. (Inquiry) \nThe reference to Mandeville is significant here. In the\nInquiry, Hutcheson considered it his task to defend, not the\nexact details of Shaftesbury’s scheme, but rather his general\nsentimentalism against the “self-interest” theories of\nMandeville and Thomas Hobbes. But leaving aside his rejection of\nself-interest theorists for the moment (see\n §2.1),\n what is the nature of Hutcheson’s overall metaethic? \nIn the Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions,\nHutcheson defines his sentimentalism in the following terms:  \n“Objects, Actions, or Events obtain the Name of Good,\nor Evil, according as they are Causes, or Occasions,\nmediately, or immediately, of a grateful, or ungrateful\nPerception to some sensitive Nature”. To understand\ntherefore the several Kinds of Good, or Evil, we\nmust apprehend the several Senses natural to us.\n(Essay, 15)  \nThis passage reveals a number of features of Hutcheson’s\nsentimentalism. First, he admits of a wide variety of what might be\ncalled evaluative modes: there are several kinds of good or\nevil, according to Hutcheson, which arise given the “grateful or\nungrateful” perceptions in people, or other “sensitive\nNatures”. These evaluative modes will correspond to the various\nsenses that are apt to receive such perceptions. \nBut what, for Hutcheson, is a “sense”? (For a very\nthorough introduction, see Schmitter 2016.) In the Essay, he\ndefines this notion as follows:  \nevery Determination of our Minds to receive Ideas independently on\nour Will, and to have Perceptions of Pleasure and Pain.\n(Essay, 17)  \nNow, this account of the nature of senses permits of a fairly broad\nrange—any “determination” of our mind to receive\nideas involuntarily is to be understood as a sense. And, indeed,\nHutcheson takes this breadth seriously. He recognizes not just the\n“five senses”—which he dubs “external”\nsenses (Inquiry, I.X; Essay I.1)—but a broad\nrange of “internal” senses. Hutcheson writes:  \nIn Musick we seem universally to acknowledge something like a distinct\nSense from the External one of Hearing, and call it a good Ear; and\nthe like distinction we should probably acknowledge in other Objects,\nhad we also got distinct Names to denote these Powers of Perception\nby. (Inquiry, I.X)  \nFor Hutcheson, the ideas, and pleasures, received via the\n“good ear”—as opposed to the simple external sense\nof hearing—are the products of an internal sense. \nIndeed, in Hutcheson’s psychology, we get a very wide array of\ninternal “senses”. While this is not an exhaustive list,\nhe lists or at least suggests senses of: \nIn Hutcheson’s psychology there is a key difference between the\nexternal and internal senses. According to Hutcheson, the external\nsenses have the power to perceive simple ideas—notes,\ncolors, sounds, tastes, etc. (Inquiry, 23). But the\ninternal senses are those, according to Hutcheson, that arise\n“only upon some previous Idea, or Assemblage,\nor Comparison of Ideas” (Essay, 15–16).\nThe internal senses, then, will proliferate under Hutcheson’s\ngeneral account—any capacity to generate pleasure or pain\ninvoluntarily given the comparison of ideas will, on Hutcheson’s\nview, be a sense. And hence it should not at all be surprising that\nHutcheson gives the diverse accounting of senses that he does. \nHowever, despite there being a difference, in Hutcheson, between the\nexternal and internal senses concerning their operation on simple or\ncomplex ideas, they are nevertheless justly grouped together\nas senses: \nSince then there are such different Powers of Perception, where what\nare commonly called the External Senses are the same; since the most\naccurate Knowledge of what the External Senses discover, often does\nnot give the Pleasure of Beauty or Harmony, which yet one of a good\nTaste will enjoy at once without much Knowledge; we may justly use\nanother Name of these higher, and more delightful Perceptions of\nBeauty and Harmony, and call the power of receiving such Impressions,\nan Internal Sense…This superior Power of Perception is justly\ncalled a Sense, because of its Affinity to other Senses in this, that\nthe Pleasure does not arise from any Knowledge of Principles,\nProportions, Causes or of the Usefulness of the Object; but strikes us\nat first with the Idea of Beauty: nor does the most accurate Knowledge\nincrease this Pleasure of Beauty, however it may super-add a distinct\nrational Pleasure from prospects of Advantage, or from the Increase of\nKnowledge. (Inquiry, 24–25) \nHere Hutcheson appears to be defending his use of the term\n“sense” to describe the internal senses as well as the\nexternal. According to Hutcheson, the fundamental similarity is the\ngeneration of pleasures and ideas immediately, without\nintervening cognitive work—the sense of taste “strikes us\nat first with the Idea of Beauty”, along with its accompanying\npleasure. \nAccording to Hutcheson’s metaethic, evaluations are specifically\nlinked to the senses, in particular the internal senses. So, for\ninstance, aesthetic goodness will be determined (in a sense to be\ndiscussed in\n §1.3)\n by the operation of the sense of imagination. Honorable actions will\nbe determined by the operation of the sense of honor. Morally good\nactions will be determined by the operation of the moral sense, and so\non. But one might wonder whether there is such a ready distinction\nbetween the internal senses. Given that we can form new ideas given\ntheir comparison, and derive pleasure from them, why believe that\nthere is such a sharp distinction between, e.g., the sense of\nimagination and the moral sense? Put another way, what\nindividuates these senses, sufficient to distinguish\nevaluative modes? \nGenerally, Hutcheson appears to individuate senses by the sorts of\nthings that generate the particular ideas/pleasures involved. For\ninstance, he suggests that “Harmony” “denotes our\npleasant Ideas arising from Composition of Sounds”\n(Inquiry 23). Here we know it is the sense of harmony, rather\nthan, e.g., the moral sense, because the pleasure we take is given\nrise by the “composition of sounds”. The pleasures of the\npublick sense arise as a result of the consideration of others’\nhappiness and misery (Essay, 17). The pleasures of the sense\nof dignity arise from others’ assessment of us, and so on. \nHowever, the moral sense has a further characteristic feature that the\nother internal senses, and hence other evaluative modes, do not.\nHutcheson’s earliest reference to the moral sense runs as\nfollows: \n[S]ome Actions have to Men an immediate Goodness; …by a\nsuperior Sense, which I call a Moral one, we perceive pleasure in the\nContemplation of such Actions in others, and are determin’d to\nlove the Agent, (and much more do we perceive Pleasure in being\nconscious of having done such Actions our selves) without any View of\nfurther natural Advantage from them. (Inquiry, 88) \nHere it appears that Hutcheson holds that the moral sense is that\nwhich takes pleasure in actions. But it is also the case that\nthe moral sense, aside from a distinctive input, as it were, maintains\na distinctive output: love of the agent. Later editions of\nthe Inquiry also identify this output as “the simple\nideas of Approbation and Condemnation” (Inquiry,\n217n45) (see Darwall 1995: 210). \nBut it would appear that, for Hutcheson, the senses—and with\nthem the evaluative modes—are distinguished by the object\nsortals to which they apply. \nGiven Hutcheson’s insistence that the operation of our various\nsenses “determines” the various evaluative modes,\nit’s clear that he is marked out as a sentimentalist in some\nform or other. But how should we understand Hutcheson’s\nsentimentalism more precisely? Several questions arise. \nFirst, we might ask a semantic question. Can we take Hutcheson, in\nexpressing his view, to be a proto-non-cognitivist? In other words, is\nit the case that when people make moral utterances, they are simply\nexpressing their attitudes? Second, we might ask an ontological or\nmetaphysical question. Can we take Hutcheson to regard his moral\nmetaphysics as response-dependent (i.e., that moral properties just\nare the properties of eliciting certain responses), or is his view\ncompatible (or does it even express) some kind of realism about moral\nproperties? \nLet’s begin with the question of whether Hutcheson is a\nnon-cognitivist. Now, of course, much depends on what one means by\nthis. But for the purpose of fixing our discussion, treat\nnon-cognitivism as a sematic thesis, according to which moral terms do\nnot refer to specific properties or objects, but are rather the\nexpression of a particular non-cognitive (such as conative, affective,\nand so on) attitude. And, indeed, there are some who read Hutcheson in\njust this way. Perhaps most famously, William Frankena writes: \nAs I read Hutcheson, then, his position is this: in passing moral\napprobation as such on an action I am not cognizing and ascribing any\nidentifiable property of goodness, etc., in or to the action, and I am\nnot cognizing or asserting any fact about the actual or possible\nreactions of any spectators to the action. I am simply feeling a\nunique sort of pleasure in contemplating the action, and I am\nexpressing this feeling by my verbal utterance, perhaps also\nexpressing (but not asserting) a conviction that others will feel this\npleasure if similarly situated, and almost certainly intending to\nevoke similar feelings in my hearers. That is, my moral approbation as\nsuch is wholly non-cognitive, very much as it is on Ayer’s more\nrecent view, except that Ayer does not bring in a unique unacquired\nmoral sense as the source of the feelings involved. (Frankena 1955:\n372) \nWhy think this? Frankena mentions that Hutcheson specifically notes\nthat our moral sense is a determination to “receive\npleasure” independently of any further ideas:  \nWe are not to imagine, that this moral Sense, more than the other\nsenses, supposes any innate Ideas, Knowledge, or practical\nProposition: We mean by it only a Determination of our Minds to\nreceive amiable or disagreeable Ideas of Actions, when they occur to\nour Observation, antecedent to any Opinions of Advantage or loss to\nredound to our selves from them. (Inquiry, 100)  \nHere it would appear that Hutcheson identifies the “amiable or\ndisagreeable Ideas” as the “immediate Pleasure”\ngained as a result of the operation of the moral sense. If so, it\nwould make some sense to say that Hutcheson holds that when making\nmoral judgments, one is simply expressing the affective attitudes,\ni.e., pleasure, that one gains as a result of the operation of the\nmoral sense. \nHowever, on balance Hutcheson’s text does not permit of this reading.\n(For a much more thorough rejection of such a reading, see Darwall\n1995: ch. 8; esp. 215–16; Kupperman 1985) Recall again his\npassage from the opening of the Essay:  \nObjects, Actions, or Events obtain the Name of Good, or\nEvil, according as they are the Causes, or Occasions,\nmediately, or immediately, of a grateful, or ungrateful\nPerception to some sensitive Nature.  \nHutcheson does not claim that the property, say,\n“goodness”, or our expressions of such a property just\nare expressions of our sensitive responses to such objects.\nBut, rather, the property of goodness identified in such objects is\nthe property of being a “Cause or Occasion” of such\nreactions. A similar thought is expressed in the opening passages of\nthe Inquiry:  \nThe Word Moral Goodness, in this Treatise, denotes our Idea of some\nQuality apprehended in Actions, which procures Approbation, and Love\ntoward the Actor, from those who receive no Advantage by the Action.\n(Inquiry, 85)  \nFrankena dismisses this passage by noting that Hutcheson, in the next\nsentence, holds that these are “Imperfect Descriptions”\n(Frankena 1955: 368). But Hutcheson does not believe that they are\n“Imperfect” in the sense of being\nincorrect—rather, he holds that these descriptions are\nimperfect in the sense requiring additional evidence and argument,\ni.e.,  \nuntil we discover whether we really have such Ideas, and what general\nFoundation there is in Nature for this Difference of actions, as\nmorally Good or Evil. \nThus it seems that we shouldn’t accept that Hutcheson is a\nnon-cognitivist in the sense meant by Frankena. For Hutcheson, moral\ngoodness (and, presumably, the other evaluative modes) refers to\nparticular properties. However, at this point we may wish to turn to\nthe nature of these properties. What sort of property is moral\ngoodness or evil? The key question is the manner in which the moral\nsense “determines” moral distinctions (Radcliffe 1986).\nThough this is a bit of a coarse-grained division, one could\ndistinguish what we might call “constitutive\nsentimentalism”, according to which the property referred to by\nthe term “good” just is the property of causing the\nrelevant sentiments in observers. Contrast this with “epistemic\nsentimentalism”, according to which the properties referred to\nby the term “good” are independent of the moral sense, but\nit is nevertheless the operation of the moral sense that allows us to\nascertain or recognize these properties (Raphael 1947). \nIndeed, it is not immediately clear from the Inquiry how we\nare to read Hutcheson on this matter. As already quoted, he holds that\nthe moral sense is the source of the ideas of moral good and\nbad (Inquiry 86). But this would appear to be neutral\nconcerning whether Hutcheson is a constitutive or epistemic\nsentimentalist. However, the passage from the Essay is less\nambiguous. As noted, he holds that objects, actions, and so on\n“obtain the name Good” insofar as they are\ncauses of the relevant perceptions (Essay, 15). And\nhence this would appear to be a constitutive sentimentalism: moral\nproperties just are those properties that cause a particular\nsentimental reaction. On this reading (or so it would seem), if our\npsychology were different, then it may be that those things that\n“procure Approbation” would be substantially different\nthan what they are now. This consequence was a key contemporary\ncriticism of Hutcheson. John Balguy, for instance, writes  \nIn the first place, it seems an insuperable difficulty in our\nauthor’s scheme, that virtue appears in it to be of an arbitrary\nand positive nature, as entirely depending upon instincts,\nthat might originally have been otherwise, or even contrary to what\nthey now are, and may be at any time altered or inverted, if the\nCreator pleases. (Balguy 1728 [BM: 390]) \nHowever, there are two further points worth making here, as we come to\nunderstand Hutcheson’s moral ontology. First, even if it were\nthe case that Hutcheson accepted a kind of constitutive\nsentimentalism, Hutcheson nevertheless believes that the property of\ngoodness could not have been otherwise. This is for two\nreasons. First, Hutcheson believes that our capacity for approbation,\nand our capacity to take pleasure in particular actions given the\nmoral sense is firmly rooted in the universal principles of human\nnature: \nBut if we call “that State, those Dispositions\nand Actions, natural, to which we are inclined by\nsome part of our Constitution, antecedently to any Volition of our\nown; or which flow from some Principles in our Nature,\nnot brought upon us by our own Art, or that of others;”\nthen it may appear, from what has been said above, that “a State\nof Good-will, Humanity, Compassion, mutual Aid, propagating and\nsupporting Offspring, Love of a Community or Country, Devotion, or\nLove and Gratitude to some governing Mind, is our natural\nState”. (Essay, 130) \nFurthermore, Hutcheson seems to believe that only the fundamental\nprinciples of human nature maintain moral authority. He writes, in the\nInquiry: \nAll Men seem persuaded of some Excellency in the Possession of good\nmoral Qualitys, which is superior to all other Enjoyments; and on the\ncontrary, look upon a State of moral Evil, as worse and more wretched\nthan any other whatsoever. We must not form our Judgment in this\nmatter from the Actions of Men; for however they may be\ninfluenc’d by moral Sentiments, yet it is certain, that\nSelf-interested Passions frequently overcome them, and partial Views\nof the Tendency of Actions, make us do what is really morally evil,\napprehending it to be good. But let us examine the Sentiments which\nMen universally form of the State of others, when they are no way\nimmediately concern’d; for in these Sentiments human Nature is\ncalm and undisturb’d, and shews its true Face.\n(Inquiry, 163–4) \nAnd the root of our moral sentiments in human nature is further\nevidence that morality is not, as suggested by Balguy, arbitrary. This\nis because, after all, we are created by a benevolent deity (Rauscher\n2003). And no benevolent deity would have chosen to impart a\ndisposition to praise, e.g., ill-will, cruelty, pain, hatred, and so\nforth as principles of human nature (Essay 132). (Indeed,\nthis passage reveals a key error in Frankena’s criticism of a\n“subjectivist”, rather than non-cognitivist, approach to\nHutcheson’s metaethics. According to Frankena, the subjectivist\nview is  \nincomplete. For it should include a statistical investigation into the\nactual or possible incidence of feelings of pleasure or pain at\ncontemplating the act in question among the preliminaries to a moral\njudgment. (Frankena 1955: 371)  \nBut Frankena fails to recognize that Hutcheson does conduct\nthis statistical inquiry. He holds that the sentiments he is\ndescribing are universal principles of human nature, implanted by a\nbenevolent deity.) Of course, that’s not to say that the deity\ncouldn’t have made us different than we are\n(Inquiry, 80; Radcliffe 1986)—just that the deity\nwouldn’t have. \nSo if Hutcheson is a constitutive sentimentalist, it appears that his\nbrand of constitutive sentimentalism has at least had some responses\nto some common objections. After all, our responses are fixtures of\nhuman nature, so there needn’t be any sort of problematic\ncontingency in the application of moral predicates. \nHowever, there is one slight complication that can and should be\nraised for the constitutive interpretation of Hutcheson. (Further to\nthis discussion, see Kail 2001.) Recall how we distinguish senses,\ni.e., via their subject matter. Now, as noted before, the\nmoral sense takes pleasure in actions. But so does, e.g., the sense of\ndignity or decency. Of course, this isn’t any particular problem\nfor his account of sense individuation. After all, Hutcheson holds, in\nthe latter case, that it is the suitableness to human nature\nupon which the sense of dignity operates. This indicates that whether\nan action is suitable to human nature is independent of the operation\nof the sense of dignity. But note that Hutcheson also (at least\noccasionally) refers to the moral sense as a quality that perceives\nand operates upon virtue and vice (Essay, 17). Now,\nwere Hutcheson a constitutive sentimentalist, this would create a\nserious problem. After all, on a constitutive sentimentalist view,\nvirtue and vice is logically posterior to the operation of the moral\nsense, rendering any attempt at individuating that particular sense\ncircular. It would appear a better reading to hold that, as a\nperceptive quality, the moral sense is perceiving and reacting to\nsomething, viz., virtue and vice, telling in favor of an\nepistemic rather than constitutive reading of Hutcheson’s\nsentimentalism. \nIn further support of an epistemic reading, consider the following\npassage from Hutcheson’s A System of Moral Philosophy.\nHere, Hutcheson writes the following: \nTho’ the approbation of moral excellence is a grateful action or\nsensation of the mind, ’tis plain the good approved is not this\ntendency to give us a grateful sensation. As, in approving a beautiful\nform, we refer to the beauty of the object; we do not say that it is\nbeautiful because we reap some little pleasure in viewing it, but we\nare pleased in viewing it because it is antecedently beautiful. Thus,\nwhen we admire the virtue of another, the whole excellence, or that\nquality which by nature we are determined to approve, is conceived to\nbe in that other; we are pleased in the contemplation because the\nobject is excellent, and the object is not judged to be therefore\nexcellent because it gives us pleasure. (System, 54; see also\nNorton 1985: 410) \nNow, this seems to be a direct rejection of his view, expressed in the\nEssay, that goodness just is the cause or occasion\nof a “grateful Perception”. Rather, or so it would appear\nhere, Hutcheson seems to be holding that the goodness is a real\nproperty of the object, which we feel pleasure upon contemplating,\njust as beauty is a real property of a particular object, which we\nfeel pleasure upon seeing or appreciating. This clearly tells in favor\nof an epistemic rather than a constitutive sentimentalism. \nOne might hold that Hutcheson, by the time he wrote the\nSystem, had changed his view. Indeed, the\nEssay’s first edition was published in 1728, and the\nSystem was a much later book, left unpublished at the time of\nhis death. A standard view is that Hutcheson’s thinking changed\nsubstantially once we reach the System (Carey 2005:\nv–vi; Scott 1900: 214). However, this explanation is\nsomewhat unsatisfactory, for at least one reason. Hutcheson was a\nperennial tinkerer. The Essay underwent no fewer than three\nseparate revised editions during Hutcheson’s lifetime. The\nfinal, third, edition of the Essay was completed and\npublished in 1742. But the System, while it was not published\nuntil after Hutcheson’s death in 1755, was substantially\ncomplete by 1737, five years earlier than the final revised\nedition of the Essay. And hence were Hutcheson to have\nchanged his view concerning the nature of the property of goodness,\none would certainly expect to see this change reflected in the text of\nthe Essay, which was revised as of 1742. But one\ndoesn’t. (This is especially striking given that Hutcheson was\nnot shy about making very substantive changes in later editions of his\nwork; this is especially true of the four editions of the\nInquiry.) \nThis, therefore, is an exegetical puzzle.  However, progress may be made by reconsidering Hutcheson’s passage from the Essay. He writes\nthat objects, etc.,“obtain the Name of Good”\ngiven their capacity to cause pleasurable sensations. Notice the word\n“obtain”. We might read Hutcheson as saying not that the\nproperty of goodness is the tendency to cause feelings of\napprobation or feelings of pleasure, but rather the property of\ngoodness is one to which we have access given our feelings of\npleasure, just in the sense that beauty is a property to which we have\naccess given our feelings of pleasure in contemplation of the\nbeautiful object. Our feelings of pleasure, in this way, serve to\nfix the reference of the term “goodness”, but do\nnot constitute the referent of that term. In other words,\nmoral goodness just is the property of XYZ, but we\n“apprehend” that property given our affective responses\nand the operation of the moral sense. For Hutcheson, the pleasure\ngenerated by the moral sense operates in an analogous way that the\ndescription of an object operates in a causal theory of reference.\n“The author of The Shining” fixes the reference\nof “Stephen King”, but the property of being Stephen\nKing is not the property of being the author of The\nShining. Similarly, that which has a tendency to cause\napprobation fixes the reference of moral goodness, but being the\nproperty of moral goodness is not the same as being the disposition to\ncause approbation. For Hutcheson, the property is independent. \nHowever we understand the ontological status of moral properties in\nHutcheson’s sentimentalism, it is clear that Hutcheson made it\nhis business to insist that the foundation of morality is not\nto be found in our rational capacities, or capacities for the\ndetermination of truth and reason (see Gill 2006: ch. 12). This put\nHutcheson at odds with his rationalist contemporaries, most\nimportantly John Balguy, Samuel Clarke, and William Wollaston. In the\nIllustrations on the Moral Sense (which was published with\nthe Essay), Hutcheson offers a sustained critique of these\nauthors and other forms of rationalism (cf. Essay,\n137–155). \nAt this point, however, it would\ndo to say a little bit about how rationalism is understood by\nHutcheson’s interlocutors. According to Clarke, the virtue\nand/or vice of particular actions is determined by the “eternal\nrelations” of “fitness and unfitness”. More\nspecifically, Clarke writes:  \nthere is a fitness or suitableness of certain circumstances to certain\npersons, and an unsuitableness of others; founded in the nature of\nthings and the qualifications of persons, antecedent to all positive\nappointment whatsoever; also that from the different relations of\ndifferent person one to another, there necessarily arises a fitness or\nunfitness of certain manners of behaviour of some persons towards\nothers: it is as manifest, as that the properties which flow from the\nessences of different mathematical figures, have different congruities\nor incongruities between themselves; or that, in mechanics, certain\nweights or powers have very different forces…. (Clarke 1706\n[BM: 192–3])  \nOne way in which this “fitness” seems to work, for Clarke,\nis that there is a “fitness” in humans worshiping God;\nthere is a “fitness” in behaving benevolently toward\nothers, and so forth. But these “fitnesses” are not known\nvia, nor are they the product of, any moral sense—they\nare “eternal and immutable” and are discoverable by\nrational inquiry. \nBalguy, another rationalist, takes a somewhat different approach.\nAccording to Balguy,  \nVIRTUE, or moral goodness, is the conformity of our moral\nactions to the reasons of things. VICE the contrary…The\nCONFORMITY of such actions to REASON, or the RECTITUDE of them, is\ntheir agreeableness to the nature and circumstances of the agents and\ntheir objects.—A social action is then right,\nwhen it is suitable to the nature and relations of the person\nconcerned. Thus a person obliged acts rightly and\nreasonably, when his actions are answerable to the relation\nof gratitude between him and his benefactor. (Balguy 1728 [BM:\n398])  \nFinally, Wollaston suggests a different variety of rationalism,\naccording to which the rightness and wrongness of action is determined\nby their interference or otherwise with “truth”. Wollaston\nwrites: \nI lay this down then as as fundamental maxim, that whoever acts as\nif things were so, or not so, doth by his acts declare, that they are\nso, or not so; as plainly as he could by words, and with more\nreality…No act (whether word or deed) of any\nbeing, to whom moral good and evil are imputable, that interferes with\nany true proposition, or denies any thing to be as it is, can be\nright…Every act therefore of such a being, as\nis before described, and all those omissions, which interfere with\ntruth (i.e., deny any proposition to be true, which is true; or\nsuppose any thing not to be what it is, in any regard) are morally\nevil, in some degree or other: the forbearing such acts, and the\nacting in opposition to such omissions are morally good: and when any\nthing may be either done, or not done, equally without the violation\nof true, that thing is indifferent. (Wollaston 1724 [BM: 243, 250]) \nIn each case, the rationalist seems to suggest that there are certain\nactions that, antecedent to our approval of them, or\nsentiments toward them, have certain qualities, i.e., they are\nreasonable, fit, true, and so forth. However, Hutcheson believes that\nall such positions are fundamentally confused. His general line of\nattack on rationalism is to disambiguate a number of potential\nreadings of rationalism, showing that each is either absurd on its\nface, or else surreptitiously relies on the existence of a moral sense\nor sentiment. “But what”, asks Hutcheson, “is this\nConformity of Actions to Reason?” (Here he clearly has\nin mind the view championed by Balguy.) And here he provides two\npossible answers.  \nWhen we ask the Reason of an Action we sometimes mean, “What\ntruth shews a Quality in the Action, exciting the Agent to do\nit?” Thus, why does a Luxurious Man pursue\nWealth? The Reason is given by this Truth, “Wealth is\nuseful to purchase Pleasures”. (Essay, 138)  \nAlternatively, Hutcheson distinguishes another way an action might be\nconformable to reason:  \nSometimes for a Reason of Actions we shew the truth expressing a\nQuality, engaging our Approbation. Thus the Reason of\nhazarding Life in just War, is, that ‘it tends to preserve our\nhonest Countrymen, or evidences publick Spirit…The former sort\nof Reasons we will call exciting, and the latter\njustifying. (Essay, 138)  \nHere Hutcheson is making reference to the, now commonplace,\ndistinction between explanatory reasons (i.e., why did a person do\nsuch a thing? what was her motivation?) and normative reasons (i.e.,\nwhy should this person have done that thing? what does this thing have\nto say for itself?, and so on). \nIn examining the nature of exciting reasons, Hutcheson rejects the\nclaim that such reasons could be antecedent to our sentiments or\naffections. For Hutcheson, our motivations must be a result of our\naffections, and cannot arise without them. \nWhen it comes to justifying reasons, Hutcheson believes that one\ncannot genuinely justify an action without reference to a moral sense.\nAs Hutcheson notes, one cannot justify an action simply by noting that\nit conforms to a true proposition, as this would justify every\npossible action (Essay, 144). Furthermore, even if we focus\non particular truths that may be said about particular\nactions (such as, e.g., “a Truth shewing an Action to be fit to\nattain an End”), these truths do not genuinely justify\nwithout some reference to the moral quality of the end\nitself. But for this we must advert to a moral sense. Simply\ndiscerning truths about particular ends will not tell us whether those\nends are morally justified: \nWe have got some strange Phrases, “that some things are\nantecedently reasonable in the Nature of the thing”, which\nsome insist upon: “That otherwise, they say, if before Man was\ncreated, any Nature without a moral Sense had existed, this\nNature would not have approved as morally good in the Deity, his\nconstituting our Sense as it is as present”. Very true; and what\nnext? If there had been no moral Sense in that Nature, there\nwould have been no Perception of Morality. But “could\nnot such Natures have seen something reasonable in one\nConstitution more than in another?”…They would have\nreasoned about both, and found out Truths:\nare both Constitutions alike reasonable to these Observers?\nNo, they say, “the benevolent one is\nreasonable, and the malicious unreasonable:”\nAnd yet these Observers reasoned and discovered\nTruths about both: An Action then is called by us\nreasonable when ’tis benevolent, and\nunreasonable when malicious. This is plainly making\nthe Word reasonable denote whatever is approved by\nour moral Sense, without Relation to true Propositions.\n(Essay, 153–4) \nHutcheson also spends considerable time examining the positions of\nClarke and Wollaston in detail. For Clarke, moral distinctions derive\nfrom the relations of fitness and unfitness, which are themselves\neternal. For Hutcheson, any construal of such relations as morally\nsignificant must presuppose a moral sense. As Hutcheson notes, we do\nnot morally praise the relations between, e.g., the natural numbers as\nin mathematics, or the fitness of certain chemical compositions. The\nfitness of a sword to end someone’s life is in and of itself\nmorally neutral. And the fitness of an action to its end is also\nmorally neutral—some actions are just as fit to human misery as\nother actions are fit to human happiness. Of course, one might hold\nthat the fitness relation is simply to be applied (in a morally\ninteresting sense) to the ultimate end of action. Happiness, in other\nwords, is “fit”; misery “unfit”. But,\naccording to Hutcheson, what does this mean? It cannot be\n“fit” to, say, give rise to some other\nthing—that’s what makes it an ultimate end. But\nany explication that would render some particular end as\n“fit” seems, according to Hutcheson to presuppose an\nindependent evaluation beyond its “fitness”.\n(Though for a reading of Hutcheson that suggests significant\ncontinuity between Hutcheson and Clarke, see Sheridan 2007.) \nHutcheson saves his most biting criticism for Wollaston’s view,\nhowever. According to Hutcheson, there is no plausibility to be had\nthat moral distinctions can be derived by the tendencies of our\nactions to signify truth or falsity. Depending upon what one\nunderstands to be “significance”, or how one understands\nWollaston’s “[acting] as if things were so, or not\nso”, we would declare as immoral such benign acts as leaving\none’s lights on at night, or traveling, as a noble,\n“without Coronets”, or walking in plainclothes despite\nbeing clergy, or writing plays or “Epicks”\n(Essay, 164–66). In addition, according to Hutcheson,\nWollaston’s system cannot distinguish between degrees of virtue\nor vice. Assuming it makes some sense to say that particular actions\nsignify truth or falsehood, this appears to be a binary\nproperty—it either does or does not. But virtue is scalar: some\nactions are horribly vicious, others are heroic, others are relatively\nmorally insignificant (Essay, 170; see also\n §2.2).\n Ultimately, then, Hutcheson concludes that Wollaston (and every other\nrationalist he considers) is really smuggling in some sort of moral\nsense in disguise, whether this is by means of a reference to the\n“reasonableness” of particular actions, a reference to\ntheir “fitness” or reference to their “significance\nof truth or falsity”. \nMost of the scholarly attention paid to Hutcheson concerns his\nmetaethics—the nature of his moral psychology, his understanding\nof the ontological status of moral facts, his critique of rationalism,\nand so forth. But equally interesting is his\nnormative ethics, which features a striking critique of\n“self-interest” theories, a unification of virtue and\nhappiness, and a view that clearly anticipates later British\nutilitarianism. \nTo begin, Hutcheson believed that the most important contribution of\nthe Inquiry was a rejection of the\n“self-interest” theories of Hobbes and Mandeville (see\nGill 2006: ch. 11). Famously, Hobbes and Mandeville placed the\nfoundation of morality on the individual self-interest of every moral\nagent. Now, Hutcheson thinks that a crass reduction of morality to\nself-interest is thoroughly untenable—else we would assign moral\nproperties to “a fruitful Field, or commodious Habitation”\n(Inquiry, 89). \nHowever—as Hutcheson clearly understands—the reduction\nmorality to self-interest proposed by the self-interest theorists is\nclearly more sophisticated than this. To see this, consider the\nargument connecting morality and self-interest from Hobbes. Hobbes\nbegins with a psychological claim. According to Hobbes, humans are\nmotivated by their own good. (Note that this is something of an\noversimplification. Hobbes believes that individuals are motivated by\nwhatever they in fact desire—but that their desires\nconstitute the nature of their good; Leviathan, VI,\nIX.) This leads them into conflict, as each person desires greater\npower to satisfy their desires, which inevitably interferes with the\ndesires of others. The result is violence, and “the life of man,\nsolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” (Leviathan,\nXIII). Notice, however, that Hobbes thinks that these tendencies in\npeople—their tendencies toward self-interest and\nself-preservation, resulting in violence—are not themselves\nmorally problematic. He writes:  \nThe desires, and other passions of man, are in themselves no sin. No\nmore are the actions, that proceed from those passions, till they know\na law that forbids them: which till laws be made they cannot know: nor\nany law be made, till they have agreed upon the person that shall make\nit. (Leviathan, XIII)  \nHobbes thus seems to think that moral normativity has an essential\nconnection to the motivations of agents. But because the motivations\nof agents are fundamentally self-directed, moral normativity cannot\nextend beyond what is in the fundamental interest of agents. \nHobbes, then, develops his self-interest theory by means of two\npremises. The first, psychological, premise is that human\nmotivation is essentially self-directed. The second,\nnormative, premise is that moral obligation is determined\nsimply given what agents will be motivated to do. \nHutcheson concentrates his attack on the first premise of this\nargument (see Bishop 1996). According to Hutcheson, we are not simply\nguided by our self-interest, but possess a form of\n“disinterested benevolence” toward others. His most\nstriking example of this comes from the following thought\nexperiment: \nTo make this yet clearer, suppose that the Deity should declare to a\ngood Man that he should be suddenly annihilated, but at the Instant of\nhis Exit it should be left to his Choice whether his Friend, his\nChildren, or his Country should be made happy or miserable for the\nFuture, when he himself could have no Sense of either Pleasure or Pain\nfrom their State. Pray would he be any more indifferent about their\nState now, that he neither hoped or feared any thing to himself from\nit, than he was in any prior Period of his Life? Nay, is it not a\npretty common Opinion among us, that after our Decease we know nothing\nof what befalls those who survive us? How comes it then that we do not\nlose, at the Approach of Death, all Concern for our Families, Friends,\nor Country? Can there be any Instance given of our desiring any Thing\nonly as the Means of private Good, as violently when we know that we\nshall not enjoy this Good many Minutes, as if we expected the\nPossession of this good for many Years? (Inquiry, 228n33) \nInsofar as our self-interest is not affected by what happens after our\ndeath, at least according to Hutcheson, it seems strange to say that\nindividuals are concerned only for their self-interest. After all, we\nappear to be concerned not just with ourselves, but with, e.g., our\nchildren, friends, and compatriots. (Note also that Hutcheson uses a\nvery similar argument against Hume’s reliance on the\nmotivational significance of sympathy. See System,\n48–49.) \nNow, as Hutcheson argues here, we may have a certain form of\npartial benevolence toward others. But Hutcheson also argues\nthat we in fact maintain “a universal Determination to\nBenevolence in Mankind, even toward the most distant parts of the\nSpecies” (Inquiry, 147; Essay, 34). He\nwrites: \nEvery one at present rejoices in the Destruction of Pirates; and yet\nlet us suppose a Band of such Villains cast upon some desolate Island,\nand that we were assur’d some Fate would confine them there\nperpetually, so that they should disturb Mankind no more. Now let us\ncalmly reflect that these Persons are capable of Knowledge and\nCounsel, may be happy, and joyful…[L]et us ask ourselves, when\nSelf-Love or regard to the Safety of better Men, no longer makes us\ndesire their Destruction…whether we would wish them the Fate of\nCadmus’s Army, by plunging their Swords in each others\nBreast…or rather that they should recover the ordinary\nAffections of Men, become Kind, Compassionate, and Friendly…and\nform an honest happy Society, with Marriages, and Relations dear, and\nall the Charities of Father, Son, and Brother—I fancy the latter\nwould be the Wish of every Mortal. (Inquiry,\n105–106) \nFurthermore, it is crucial for Hutcheson that motivations of\nself-interest should play no role in the esteem of actions as\nvirtuous. And hence According to Hutcheson, our moral sense approves\nonly actions motivated by benevolence, not self-interest: \nIf we examine all the Actions which are counted amiable any where, and\nenquire into the Grounds upon which they are approv’d, we shall\nfind, that in the Opinion of the Person who approves them, they always\nappear as Benevolent, or flowing from Love of others, and a Study of\ntheir Happiness, whether the Approver be one of the Persons\nbelov’d, or profited, or not; so that all those kind Affections\nwhich incline us to make others happy, and all Actions suppos’d\nto flow from such Affections, appear morally Good, if while they are\nbenevolent toward some Persons, they be not pernicious to others.\n(Inquiry, 116) \nIndeed, for Hutcheson,  \nthe Perfection of Virtue consists in ‘having the universal\ncalm Benevolence, the prevalent Affection of the Mind, so as to\nlimit and counteract not only the selfish Passions, but even\nthe particular kind Affections. (Essay, 8)  \nIndeed, even if a particular action is beneficent in its\neffects—that is, it benefits other people to some extent or\nother—Hutcheson holds that such an action cannot be esteemed as\nvirtuous if we presume that the action was motivated by\nself-interest: \nNor shall we find any thing amiable in any Action whatsoever, where\nthere is no Benevolence imagin’d; nor in any Disposition, or\nCapacity, which is not suppos’d applicable to, and\ndesign’d for benevolent Purposes. Nay, as was before\nobserv’d, the Actions which in fact are exceedingly useful,\nshall appear void of moral Beauty, if we know they proceeded from no\nkind Intentions toward others; and yet an unsuccessful Attempt of\nKindness, or of promoting publick Good, shall appear as amiable as the\nmost successful, if it flow’d from as strong Benevolence.\n(Inquiry, 116) \nHutcheson is often recognized as an early figure in the development of\ncontemporary utilitarianism. Indeed, it was Hutcheson who first used\nthe phrase, in identifying the nature of moral goodness, that acts\nshould promote “the greatest happiness for the greatest\nnumber”. He writes, in the Inquiry, that  \nthat Action is best, which procures the greatest Happiness for the\ngreatest Numbers; and that, worst, which, in like manner, occasions\nMisery. (Inquiry, 125) \nBut is Hutcheson really a utilitarian? And if so, what sort of\nutilitarian is he? \nTo begin, there are passages in Hutcheson that sound quite\nutilitarian, indeed. In the early editions of the Inquiry,\nHutcheson suggests a quasi-mathematical principle by which to  \ncompute the Morality of any Actions, with all their Circumstances,\nwhen we judge of the Actions done by our selves, or by others.\n(Inquiry, 128)  \nHe holds that  \nThe moral Importance of any Agent, or the Quantity of publick Good\nproduced by him, is in a compound Ratio of his Benevolence and\nAbilitys: or (by substituting the Letters for the Words, as M = Moment\nof Good, and μ = Moment of Evil) M = B × A.\n(Inquiry, 128)  \nDeriving, then, that a person’s benevolence is determined by\nM/A, Hutcheson declares that  \nmust be the Perfection of Virtue where M = A, or when the Being acts\nto the utmost of his Power for the public Good. (Inquiry,\n130)  \n(It should be noted that the fourth edition of the Inquiry\nrefrains from this technical language, but the general idea remains\nthe same. See Inquiry, 234n56.) \nNow this sounds as if Hutcheson is espousing a relatively\nstraightforward utilitarianism. After all, the morality of an action\nis determined, on this view, by whether or not an agent produces the\ngreatest “publick Good” he or she can. In addition,\n“Publick Good”, here, is understood by Hutcheson to mean\nthe “natural Good of Mankind” (Inquiry, 91) where\n“natural good” (more on this later) is understood to mean\na person’s happiness, defined in hedonistic terms\n(Inquiry, 86; Essay, 87). Putting this all together,\nwe get a standard, run-of-the-mill, hedonistic utilitarianism. \nHowever, there are major deviations from a straightforward\nutilitarianism as we might understand it from, e.g., Bentham or\nSidgwick (see Albee 1896: 32–35). First, Hutcheson appears to\noffer us something like a scalar utilitarianism. On a scalar\nview, there is no absolute rightness or wrongness, but rather degrees\nof rightness or wrongness that an action may display (see Norcross\n2020). And while Hutcheson does discuss the notion of “perfect\nvirtue”—achieved when the good one has the ability to do\nis equal to the good one does—he admits that there will be\ndegrees of virtue (which simply follows given his mathematical\ncalculations), and does not describe the perfection of virtue as any\nsort of absolute obligation (see Darwall 1997: 87–88). (Indeed,\nthis point is essential to his critique of Wollaston,\n §1.4.) \nSecond, Hutcheson clearly intends his moral “calculation”\nto refer, at least in part, to the motivation of a given\naction. Only actions motivated by benevolence will be perfectly\nvirtuous. If one is motivated by self-interest, or has a mixed\nmotivation, the extent to which the action was motivated by\nself-interest will be deducted from the overall moral character of an\naction:  \nwhen the Moment of Good, in an Action partly intended for the Good of\nthe Agent, is but equal to the Moment of Good in the Action of another\nAgent, influenc’d only by Benevolence, the former is less\nvirtuous; and in this Case the Interest must be deducted to find he\ntrue Effect of the Benevolence. (Inquiry, 129)  \nSo Hutcheson clearly means to hold that any “publick good”\nthat is to be credited to the moral quality of an act must be\nintended. \nThird, Hutcheson holds that the consequences of a particular act will\nhave no bearing on its moral quality not just if it is not intended,\nbut also if it is not foreseen:  \nIt is true indeed, that that publick Evil which I neither certainly\nforesee, nor have actual Presumptions of, as the Consequence of my\nAction, does not make my present Action Criminal, or Odious; even\naltho I might have foreseen this Evil by a serious Examination of my\nown Actions; because such actions do not, at present, evidence either\nMalice, or want of Benevolence…In like manner, no good Effect\nwhich I did not actually foresee and intend, makes my Action morally\nGood. (Inquiry, 131). \nThe second and third deviations from a standard utilitarianism might\nbe expected given his affirmed belief that the motivation of virtuous\nactors is paramount in understanding the virtue of their action. As\nalready noted, Hutcheson holds that the moral sense approves actions\ninsofar as they are motivated by disinterested benevolence. Thus far\none might state his version of utilitarianism as a kind of scalar\nmotivational utilitarianism (which we should think of as clearly\ndistinct from a “motive” utilitarianism (see Adams 1976),\naccording to which morally appropriate actions are motivated by\ndispositions the possession of which leads to the best consequences),\naccording to which an act is virtuous insofar as the agent\naims at the greatest overall good. \nBut there is one interesting twist that is briefly suggested by\nHutcheson that is also worth mentioning. Hutcheson holds that the\nperfectly benevolent, and hence perfectly virtuous, agent will aim at\nthe greatest public good they can achieve. But the “publick\ngood” here should not be understood as a straightforward\naggregate of happiness across persons. In describing his understanding\nof public good, Hutcheson says this: \nIn comparing the moral Qualitys of Actions, in order to regulate our\nElection among various Actions propos’d, or to find which of\nthem has the greatest moral Excellency, we are led by our moral Sense\nof Virtue to judge thus; that in equal Degrees of Happiness, expected\nto proceed from the Action, the Virtue is in proportion to the Number\nof Persons to whom the Happiness shall extend; (and here the Dignity,\nor moral Importance of Persons, may compensate Numbers) and in equal\nNumbers, the Virtue is as the Quantity of the Happiness, or natural\nGood; or that the Virtue is in a compound Ratio of the Quantity of\nGood, and Number of Enjoyers…Again, when the Consequences of\nActions are of a mix’d Nature, partly Advantageous, and partly\nPernicious; that Action is good, whose good Effects preponderate the\nevil, by being useful to many, and pernicious to few; and that, evil,\nwhich is otherwise. Here also the moral Importance of Characters, or\nDignity of Persons may compensate Numbers; as may also the Degrees of\nHappiness or Misery: for to procure an inconsiderable Good to many,\nbut an immense Evil to few, may be Evil; and an immense Good to few,\nmay preponderate a small Evil to many. (Inquiry, 125) \nTwo things are worth noting here. First, and less interestingly, the\nphrase “compound Ratio of the Quantity of Good, and Number of\nEnjoyers” suggests that Hutcheson is inclined toward a form of\naverage utilitarianism, rather than total\nutilitarianism (see Smart & Williams 1974: 27–28; Parfit\n1984: 420–421). Furthermore, and compatible with this form of\naverage utilitarianism, Hutcheson holds that small benefits spread\nover many persons need not compensate for massive evils subjected to\nfew, and that small evils spread over many may be a price worth paying\nfor large benefits for a small number. All this is compatible with\nstandard forms of utilitarian aggregation. \nBut, more interestingly, Hutcheson suggests that the “Dignity,\nor moral Importance of Persons, may compensate Numbers”. How to\nunderstand this passage? One might interpret it as a proto version of\na view according to which the moral virtue of individuals is\nintrinsically significant, the happiness of two people, one of whom is\nvirtuous, the other vicious, are not of equal value. (One might\ncompare this to a form of “luckism” as advocated by, e.g.,\nRichard Arneson [2004].) But Hutcheson explicitly denies this reading\none paragraph earlier. He writes: \nThe moral Beauty, or Deformity of Actions, is not alter’d by the\nmoral Qualitys of the Objects, any further than the Qualitys of the\nObjects increase or diminish the Benevolence of the Action, or the\npublick Good intended by it. Thus Benevolence toward the worst\nCharacters, or the Study of their Good, may be as amiable as any\nwhatsoever; yea often more so than that toward the Good, since it\nargues such a strong Degree of Benevolence as can surmount the\ngreatest Obstacle, the moral Evil in the Object. (Inquiry,\n124) \nFor Hutcheson, any “compensation” the moral worth of\nindividuals is allowed in comparison to numbers must be understood to\nbe pragmatic:  \nYet when our Benevolence to the Evil, encourages them in their bad\nIntentions, or makes them more capable of Mischief; this diminishes or\ndestroyes the Beauty of the Action, or even makes it evil, as it\nbetrays a Neglect of the Good of others more valuable.\n(Inquiry, 124)  \nIn addition, in the System, Hutcheson holds that it is more\nimportant to benefit friends, family, and people “of eminent\nvirtue” in comparison to strangers, but notice that only when\nall other circumstances are equal is one permitted to favor such\nindividuals (see System, 247–8). \nBut this is puzzling. It would appear that any attention we pay to the\nmoral worth of the objects of our beneficence is simply given the\ngeneral consequences such beneficence may produce. And hence it would\nappear that the “moral Importance of Persons” is not\nactually “compensating” numbers at all. Rather, the moral\nimportance of persons is or perhaps could be an important causal\nfactor in the overall production of happiness or the overall\ndistribution of happiness, but is not itself a compensatory\naxiological variable. But this is also puzzling, insofar as Hutcheson\nseems to treat the moral importance of persons as such a variable\ntwice. At this point Hutcheson’s embrace, or\nlack thereof, of luckism must be left as an interpretive puzzle. \nThe first sentence of Hutcheson’s System of Moral\nPhilosophy runs this way:  \nThe intention of moral philosophy is to direct men to that course of\naction which tends most effectually to promote their greatest\nhappiness and perfection; as far as it can be done by observations and\nconclusions discoverable from the constitution of nature, without aids\nof supernatural revelation. (System, 1)  \nPut another way, Hutcheson holds that his aim in discussing the very\nnature of virtue, benevolence, and the moral sense, is to persuade\npeople to act in such a way as to develop “their greatest\nhappiness and perfection” (see Heydt 2009). And to this end, it\nis important to note that Hutcheson steadfastly maintains that\nvirtuous behavior is in the interest of the virtuous. Of course, given\nthat Hutcheson holds that behavior is virtuous insofar as it is\nmotivated by benevolence and not self-interest, it is\nimpossible (on Hutcheson’s view) to pursue one’s\nself-interest through virtuous behavior. To be motivated by self-love\ndiminishes, to that extent, the virtue of one’s action. \nBut it is nevertheless the case, for Hutcheson, that virtue\nis in one’s self-interest. Notice, however, that\nHutcheson’s argument for this claim is not straightforward. As\nhas already been indicated, Hutcheson is a hedonist:  \nBecause we shall afterwards frequently use the Words Interest,\nAdvantage, natural Good, it is necessary here to fix their Ideas. The\nPleasure in our sensible Perceptions of any kind, gives us our first\nIdea of natural Good, or Happiness; and then all Objects which are apt\nto excite this Pleasure are call’d immediately Good…Our\nSense of Pleasure is antecedent to Advantage or Interest, and is the\nFoundation of it. (Inquiry, 86)  \nBut how could it be that a hedonist, of all things, believes\nthat benevolent acts—acts that are motivated for the good of\nothers—are always in our self-interest? Surely such acts can\ninvolve sacrifice of our own pleasure, as when a father dutifully endures the\npainful duration of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: the Live\nMusical!” for the sake of his daughter’s delight in\nwatching it. \nThe simple story, to be complicated shortly, runs this way. Hutcheson\nholds that the moral sense is a greater repository of pleasure than\nthe other senses. He says, in many places, that the operation of the\nmoral sense provides more pleasure than the operation of the\nother senses, internal and external. Hutcheson states, in the\nInquiry, that the moral sense “gives us more Pleasure\nand Pain that all our other Facultys” (Inquiry, 163).\nIn the Essay, Hutcheson writes:  \nOur moral Sense thus regulated, and constantly followed in our\nActions, may be the most constant Source of the most stable\nPleasure. (Essay, 126) \nHutcheson offers a number of arguments for this, generally appealing\nto our own intuitions about the nature of happiness:  \nNow should we imagine a rational Creature in a sufficiently happy\nState, though his Mind was, without interruption, wholly\noccupy’d with pleasant Sensations of Smell, Taste, Touch,\n&c., if at the same time all other Ideas were excluded? Should we\nnot thing the State low, mean and sordid, if there were no Society, no\nLove or Friendship, no good Offices? (Inquiry, 163)  \nSo much for the external senses. But he goes on:  \nWould we ever wish to be in the same Condition with a wrathful,\nmalicious, revengeful, or envious Being, tho we were at the same time\nto enjoy all the Pleasures of the external and internal\nsenses?…What Castle-builder, who forms to himself imaginary\nScenes of Life, in which he thinks he should be happy, ever made\nacknowledg’d Treachery, Cruelty, or Ingratitude, the Steps by\nwhich he mounted to his wish’d for Elevation, or Parts of his\nCharacter, when he had attain’d it? We always conduct our selves\nin such Reveries, according to the Dictates of Honour, Faith,\nGenerosity, Courage…. (Inquiry, 163–4) \nNow, this is fine as far as it goes. But notice that Hutcheson does\nnot explain why it should be that, e.g., our Castle-building friends\ntend to imagine that they are virtuous rather than vicious. And why\nshould it be that in every case, the virtuous are better-off than the\nvicious? \nA key mechanism here is the notion of a “reflex Act”. Lord\nShaftesbury—borrowing Locke’s notion of\n“reflection”—introduces the idea this way (see Baier\n& Luntley 1995): \nIn a Creature capable of forming general Notions of Things, not only\nthe outward Beings which offer themselves to the Sense, are the\nObjects of the Affection; but the very Actions themselves,\nand the Affections of Pity, Kindness, Gratitude, and their\nContrarys, being brought into the Mind by Reflection, become Objects.\nSo that, by means of this reflected Sense, there arises another kind\nof Affection towards those very Affections themselves, which have been\nalready felt, and are now become the subject of new Liking or Dislike.\n(Shaftesbury 1711, v. 2, 16) \nFor Hutcheson, while we do not immediately receive pleasure from our\nown virtuous actions, we nevertheless can take the part of a spectator\nto ourselves. When we do this, our virtuous actions will trigger our\nmoral sense, itself—as Hutcheson is insistent upon—the\nfount of the most valuable pleasures. (Hutcheson details this in the\n“D” (i.e., final, 1738) edition of the Inquiry.)\nHe writes:  \nevery Spectator is persuaded that the reflex Acts of the virtuous\nAgent upon his own Temper will give him the highest pleasures.\n(Inquiry, 217n47) \nAgain, this is fine as far as it goes. But we may still wonder why it\nis that such “reflex Acts”, even if engaging the moral\nsense, necessarily produce the “highest pleasures?” And\nwhat is exactly meant by such a phrase? \nOne solution to this puzzle, opted for by some commentators, holds\nthat Hutcheson is a kind of qualitative hedonist—a view\naccording to which some pleasures are of higher quality, and therefore\nmore valuable, pleasurableness held equal (Edwards 1979: 30; Riley\n2008: 275; Strasser 1987: 518; Crisp 2020: 124). And there are some\nvery tantalizing passages that suggest just this: \nAs to pleasures of the same kind, ’tis manifest their values are\nin a joint proportion of their intenseness and duration. In estimating\nthe duration, we not only regard the constancy of the object, or its\nremaining in our power, and the duration of the sensations it affords,\nbut the constancy of our fancy or relish: for when this changes it\nputs an end to the enjoyment. In comparing pleasures of different\nkinds, the value is as the duration and dignity of the kind jointly.\nWe have an immediate sense of a dignity, a perfection, or beatifick\nquality in some kinds, which no intenseness of the lower kinds can\nequal, were they also as lasting as we could wish. No intenseness or\nduration of any external sensation gives it a dignity or worth equal\nto that of the improvement of the soul by knowledge, or the ingenious\narts; and much less is it equal to that of virtuous affections and\nactions. (System, 117) \nHere it would seem that Hutcheson’s justification for treating\nvirtuous conduct as in the interest of the virtuous is as plain as\nday. In conducting our “reflex Acts” concerning our own\nvirtuous conduct, we trigger our “virtuous affections”,\nwhich themselves have a “worth” that no intenseness or\nduration of any external sensation could match. If we interpret\nHutcheson as a qualitative hedonist, the explanation of the benefits\none maintains as a result of virtue are straightforward. \nWhat is less straightforward is whether or not Hutcheson genuinely is\nthis form of qualitative hedonist. And there is very good reason to\ndoubt it. (Much more detailed argument for this point is available in\nDorsey 2010.) Nowhere in this passage is the “dignity” of\na pleasure thought an axiologically significant variable. In the\nEssay, Hutcheson writes explicitly that:  \nThe Value of any Pleasure, and the Quantity or\nMoment of any Pain, is in a compounded proportion of the\nIntenseness and Duration. (Essay, 87)  \nIn the Inquiry, he seems especially clear that the\nsuperiority of the moral sense is quantitative rather than\nqualitative: it produces “more” pleasure than our other\nsenses (Inquiry, 162). Furthermore, while the System\npassage cited above is extremely suggestive when it comes to\ninterpreting Hutcheson as a qualitative hedonist, a mere chapter\nearlier in the System he seems to commit to a straightforward\nquantitative hedonism:  \nsupreme happiness must consist in the most constant enjoyment of the\nmost intense and durable pleasures. (System, 100)  \nOn a quantitative reading of Hutcheson’s hedonism, rather than\nbeing an axiological guarantee that the pleasures of the moral sense\nare more valuable, it is simply a matter of psychological fact that\nhuman beings take more intense and durable pleasures from the moral\nsense, sufficient to override whatever joys may be taken in the low\nroad.","contact.mail":"ddorsey@ku.edu","contact.domain":"ku.edu"}]
