Although one can debate about entities such\nas viruses, there is little debate that cells are living. Cells\nperform all the activities critical to life, from metabolism to\nreproduction. All cells alive today maintain themselves far from\nthermodynamic equilibrium with their environment and are part of a\ncontinuous lineage of cell division that goes back approximately 4\nbillion years. The study of cells has required developing means of\nmaterially manipulating them and our contemporary understanding of\ncellular phenomena integrates results from a wide range of material\ninterventions. In introducing a special issue of Studies in\nHistory and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences on\nthe cell, O’Malley and Müller-Wille assert \n\n\n\n\nThe cell, we suggest, is a nexus: a connection point between\ndisciplines, methods, technologies, concepts, structures and\nprocesses. Its importance to life, and to the life sciences and\nbeyond, is because of this remarkable position as a nexus, and because\nof the cell’s apparently inexhaustible potential to be found in\nsuch connective relationships. (2010: 169) \n\n\n\nThe examination of cell biology, in turn, is a potent nexus for\nproductive interactions between philosophers, historians, and social\nscientists, each of whom raises questions about the study of cells\nrelevant to the others.\n\n\nDuring the period when philosophy of science focused primarily on\nlaws, cell biology was largely neglected. Although it is important to\ncell biologists to discover useful generalizations, these are seldom\ncharacterized as laws. Once philosophers of science turned their\nattention from laws to mechanisms, from representational realism to\nmodels and their functionality, and from concepts and theories to\nexperiments and instrumentation, more philosophers of science have\nturned their attention to the practices of cell biology. These\npractices are epistemically challenging. Due to the fact that cells\nare mostly microscopic, they raise traditional philosophical issues\nconcerning the status of unobservables and the trustworthiness of\nevidence. Since a major concern of cell biology is to relate functions\n(e.g., biochemical reactions) to cell structures, cell biologists need\nnot just to observe but also to physically manipulate cells and their\nconstituent structures and to develop informative representations.\nTheir activities thus provide rich examples for philosophers. Although\na great deal of cell biology has yet to be tapped for philosophical\nanalysis, we provide examples in which philosophers (as well as\nhistorians) have investigated and analyzed material practices in cell\nbiology. We start, however, closer to theoretical interests, examining\nhow the discipline of cell biology developed and how metaphors have\nplayed crucial roles in shaping how scientists have conceptualized\ncells. Subsequently we turn to controversies over whether cells can be\nunderstood mechanistically or require a vitalist or holist\nperspective. After that, we turn to questions of epistemology,\nincluding strategies for representing cells visually and for\ndeveloping mechanistic accounts of cell functioning.\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that scientific disciplines are\nsharply-delineated and can be defined by their subject matter. In\nfact, however, they are dynamically changing, shaped in large part by\nscientists, their research tools, and academic and research\ninstitutions. This is clearly true in the case of cell biology.\nScientists began investigating cells in the seventeenth century after\nHooke and van Leeuwenhoek reported what they saw with newly invented\nmicroscopes. Hooke (1665) gave cells their name. But the cell did not\nbecome a focal unit for studying biological processes until Schleiden\n(1838) and Schwann (1839) advanced the cell theory according to which\ncells are the basic living units. The term cytology was\nwidely used for the studies that ensued, which focused mainly on\ndescribing cells as seen under the light microscope. Although Wilson\nused the phrase cellular biology in his introduction to\nCowdry’s General Cytology (Cowdry 1924), and many of\nits contributors aspired to integrate disciplines studying cells, the\nterm cell biology was only introduced in the years\nimmediately after World War II. Those adopting the term cell\nbiology advocated complementing new higher-resolution images\ncreated with the electron microscope with results from biochemical,\nbiophysical, and molecular approaches to cells. This transition is\nexemplified in the naming of what would become the flagship journal in\nthe field. The working title used in discussions about founding a new\njournal was Journal of Cytology. By the time of the first\nissue in 1955, it was called the Journal of Biophysical and\nBiochemical Cytology, a title chosen to emphasize the integration\nof multiple approaches to the study of cells. In 1962 it was\nre-christened The Journal of Cell Biology, by which time the\nInternational Society for Cell Biology and the American Society for\nCell Biology had also been established and the term cell\nbiology had acquired general currency for an integrated approach\nto cells. (Bechtel 2006: chapter 7, examines the establishment and\nrenaming of the journal as well as the creation of the American\nSociety for Cell Biology.) \nThe introduction of new research techniques, especially cell\nfractionation and electron microscopy, figured centrally in the\nefforts to establish cell biology as a distinct discipline in the\npost-World War II period as they enabled constructing what Palade\n(1987) termed a bridge between morphological observations and\nbiochemistry. Cell fractionation employs the ultracentrifuge to\nseparate cell contents into fractions that contain the enzymes\nresponsible for distinct cell activities while electron microscopy\nenables these fractions to be linked to organelles identifiable in\ncells. Matlin (2018) describes how Claude employed centrifugation to\nidentify microsomes which exhibited high concentrations of RNA.\nPorter’s (1953) complementary micrographs of these particles in\nfractions and tissue slices (Figure 1) linked microsomes to the\nintracellular structure he had named the endoplasmic\nreticulum. As Matlin describes, this cycling between cell\nfractionation to establish function and electron microscopy to\nlocalize it to a structure was pursued repeatedly in cell biology. \nFigure 1: Micrographs of a fraction\ncontaining microsome and of a thin-sliced preparation from a cell\nshowing the endoplasmic reticulum (marked as er). From Porter\n(1953), plate 48. \nIn terms of content, however, the break between cytology and cell\nbiology was nowhere near as sharp as the founders of cell biology\nportrayed. Cowdry’s General Cytology (1924) clearly had\nsimilar aspirations of linking studies of morphology and studies of\ncellular chemistry (see discussions by historians, philosophers, and\nbiologists of Cowdry’s project in Matlin, Maienschein, &\nLaubichler 2018). But in terms of the institutions in which scientists\nconducted their research, the break was quite significant. With the\ncreation of professional societies using the name “cell\nbiology”, biologists began to self-identify as cell biologists.\nLaboratories and academic departments adopted the name cell\nbiology and funding agencies recognized cell biology as a\nsupported field of research. \nAlthough cell biologists actively courted biochemists and to some\ndegree biophysicists to join their new discipline, these efforts\nlargely failed. The most enduring connections were with molecular\nbiology, which was established as a new discipline in the same period\n(see the entry on\n molecular biology).\n While molecular biology began with a focus on bacterial phage\n(viruses that infect bacteria) and cell biology with eukaryotic cells\nfrom mammals and plants, by the 1970s each discipline had broadened\nits focus and soon many cell biologists were adopting a molecular\napproach to cell structure and function. (A continuing point of\ndifference between cell biology and molecular biology is that cell\nbiology placed high value on linking chemical and molecular processes\nto cell structure; see Matlin 2016). Academic departments began to\ninclude both cell and molecular in their names. In\nNovember 1989 the American Society for Cell Biology created a new\njournal, Cell Regulation, but with its third volume in\nJanuary 1992, the name was changed to Molecular Biology of the\nCell. Although there are textbooks that reference just cell\nbiology in their title, several of the most prominent textbooks\nfeature both cell and molecular. These include\nAlberts’ Molecular Biology of the Cell (Alberts,\nJohnson, Lewis et al. 2015) , Cooper and Hausman’s The Cell:\nA Molecular Approach (2007), and Iwasa and Marshall’s\nKarp’s Cell and Molecular Biology (2016). The first\nedition of Alberts’ Molecular Biology of the Cell\n(Alberts, Bray, Lewis et al. 1983) was modeled in part on\nWatson’s Molecular Biology of the Gene (1976) and\nincluded Watson as a co-editor. Alberts attributes the vision of\nintegrating cell and molecular biology to Watson (see interview with\nAlberts in the Oral History Collection at Cold Springs Harbor\nLaboratory linked in\n Other Internet Resources below) \nNot only have the disciplines studying cells undergone historical\ntransformations, so has the understanding of what cells are. As Hesse\n(1966) argued, in many fields the objects of study are characterized\nthrough metaphors to more familiar objects. In examining the different\nmetaphors that have been invoked for cells, Reynolds argues that the\nchoice of metaphor has consequences for how cells are understood:  \nMetaphorical language … has been essential not only to the\nactivity of describing cells but also to seeing and\nunderstanding them, and has played no less a fundamental role\nthan the literal and material lenses of the microscope. (2018: 4)  \nReynolds distinguishes two fundamental classes of metaphors: cells\nas human artifacts and cells as organisms. Each has\ntaken on a variety of more specific forms. Among artifacts, cells have\nbeen characterized as spaces enclosed by solid walls, building blocks,\nfactories, various types of machines, and electronic computers. The\norganismal metaphors have suggested a conceptualization of cells as\nelementary organisms (like unicellular amoebae) or citizens in a state\nor society in which there is a division of labor and in which cells\nmake decisions that determine their own developmental\n‘fates’, including the ultimate decision to initiate\nprogrammed cell death (Reynolds\n 2014).[1]\n These metaphors have given rise to distinctive research agendas that\nfocus on specific aspects of cells and their relationship to other\ncells and their environment. \nWhen Hooke introduced the term cell in Micrographia\nin 1665 to describe the microscopic structure of cork that he observed\nusing a compound microscope\n (Figure 2A),\n he was comparing cells to the polygonal cells of beeswax and the\nsmall rooms occupied by monks in a monastery. (Hooke 1665: 116, also\ncommented on the fluid content of cells, labeling them\n“succus nutritus, or appropriate juices of\nvegetables”. As discussed below, the fluid content of cells took\non new importance with the advent of the protoplasm theories in the\nmid-nineteenth century.) Although researchers who focused on plants\ntended to find Hooke’s metaphor appropriate, since plant cells\nhave clearly observable walls, others, beginning with van Leeuwenhoek,\nwho examined spermatozoa\n (Figure 2B),\n animal tissues, and bacteria, tended to adopt other terms such as\ncorpuscle or globule.  \nA. Hooke’s (1665: Schem: XI, fig.\n1 facing page 115) drawing of his observations of cells in cork. \nB.Van Leeuwenhoek’s drawing of\nspermatozoa from his Letter to Nehemiah Grew, 18 March 1678.  \nFigure 2: Hooke’s drawing clearly\nshows cells as areas enclosed by walls whereas van Leeuwenhoek’s\npresents what we call cells as simple organisms. \nMost of these early investigators focused on describing what they saw\nin the microscope. But some, such as Buffon (1749), began to view\ncells as basic living units. Nicholson characterizes this as the\nbeginning of an atomist tradition in biology that identified  \na basic indivisible unit of life and [sought] to explain the\nmorphological constitution and physiological operation of all living\nbeings in terms of these fundamental units. (2010: 203)  \nThis more theoretically committed conception of cells is exemplified\nin the publications of Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839), who are\ngenerally credited with establishing the cell theory, the fundamental\ntenet of which is that cells are the basic units of living things. \nFocusing exclusively on plants, Schleiden asserted that\n“… every plant … is an aggregate of fully\nindividualized, independent, separate beings, the cells\nthemselves” (1838 [1847: 231–2]). In addition to their\nwalls, Schleiden appealed to the nucleus, which had been identified\nwith improved microscopes by Brown (1833), to identify plant\ncells. The nucleus figured centrally in Schleiden’s account of\ncell formation according to which a new cell formed through a process\nlike crystal formation—one type of material is deposited around\nthe nucleolus to form the nucleus and then other material was\ndeposited to form the cell body. The metaphor comparing cell formation\nto crystal formation played a yet larger role when Schwann confronted\nthe challenge that animal cells differ vastly in their\nappearance. Schwann argued that they were nonetheless all cells since\nthey all formed through a process analogous to crystal formation:  \nThe elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an\nanalogous, though very diversified manner, so that it may be asserted\nthat there is one universal principle of development for the\nelementary parts of organisms, however different, and that this\nprinciple is the formation of cells. (Schwann 1839 [1847: 165])\n \n(For discussion of this and other uses of the crystal metaphor in\nbiology, see Haraway 1976.) \nGiven that Schwann and Schleiden were masters of microscopy (as\nwitnessed by their drawings based on their microscopic observations),\nand that other equally competent microscopists reported cells\ndividing, their claim that cells form like crystals seems anomalous.\nBechtel (1984) argues that Schwann’s strong commitment to\ndeveloping mechanistic accounts of vital processes may have played a\nmajor role in how he interpreted what he saw—the crystal\nformation metaphor provided a mechanistic model whereas at the time\nthere were no mechanical models for cell division. In any case,\nSchleiden’s and Schwann’s accounts of cell formation were\nsoon set aside as more researchers reported on cell division and\nSchwann’s concerns with mechanism were supplanted by other\nconcerns. Virchow (1855), a pathologist, offered a theoretic argument\nthat only a process like cell division could explain the transmission\nof disease and coined the oft-cited dictum “omnis cellula e\ncellula” (all cells come from cells). \nSchwann’s “theory of the cell”, however, was much\nricher than his soon rejected view of cell formation. He argued that\ncells were the basic units in which the processes of life (he coined\nthe term metabolism) occurred. He viewed metabolic processes\nas catalyzed by the specific materials that were deposited in cells as\nthey formed. Schwann (1836) had himself recently discovered pepsin, a\ncatalyst that breaks down egg albumin. (Pepsin operates, however, not\nwithin cells but after being secreted into digestive fluid.) When a\nyear later he argued that fermentation could not occur without the\ninvolvement of a whole living yeast cell (Schwann 1837), some critics\ntook Schwann to be claiming that living systems exhibited mysterious\nvital properties. But for Schwann this was consistent with his\nmechanist approach—the metabolic processes only occurred when\nthe responsible catalysts were brought together in cells. \nIn the mid- to late-nineteenth century theorizing about cells went in\na number of directions. One direction focused even more than Schwann\non the material stuff constituting the cell. In the same period as\nSchwann was advancing his theory of the cell, von Mohl (1835), a plant\nresearcher, introduced the name protoplasm for the fluid\nmaterial in cells. Animal researchers such as Dujardin (1835) called\nthe fluid seen in animal cells sarcode. Remak (1852) proposed\nthe protoplasm theory according to which the basic material of plants\nand animal was identical and T. H. Huxley (1869) took this a step\nfurther, arguing that protoplasm was the “physical basis of\nlife”. As discussed by Reynolds, protoplasm theory offered a\ndifferent fundamental biological theory—whereas Schleiden and\nSchwann  \nsought to unify all the various forms of life through a common\nmorphological type and developmental principle, the protoplasm theory\nattempted to achieve this through the identification of a common\nsubstance or material. (2018: 32)  \nAccordingly, some supporters of protoplasm sought to dislodge the cell\nas a basic living unit. The botanist Julius Sachs (1892), for example,\nasserted “to call the protoplasm unit a cell was about as\nappropriate as calling a live bee in a honeycomb a cell” (as\ntranslated by Welch & Clegg 2010: C1281). Since protoplasm appears\nas a viscous substance that is only artificially constrained by cell\nboundaries, some protoplasm theorists viewed it as supplanting the\ncell as an organizing unit. Where Schwann understood the cell to be\nthe fundamental unit of biological development, protoplasm theorists\nunderstood protoplasm to drive ontogeny and cells to be merely\nsecondary structures deposited in the course of this primary\nsubstance’s development. Recently a few biologists (Welch &\nClegg 2010, 2012) and philosophers (Nicholson, 2010) have argued for\nreviving protoplasm theory. Their argument is that protoplasm theory\npresents a more holistic systems or organismal perspective. (We\ndiscuss holism and organicism in\n Section 3.) \nThe characterization of protoplasm as just a viscous substance\nexisting on its own was complicated by the identification of the cell\nmembrane as a structure distinct from the cell wall and, as discussed\nbelow, of membrane-bound organelles. In the end, most biologists\nacquiesced in some version of Schultze’s (1861: 11; as\ntranslated by Hall, 1951: 451) compromise position that raised\nprotoplasm to be one defining feature of cells when he defined a cell\nas “a lump of protoplasm inside of which lies a\nnucleus”. Those who adopted such a compromise position often\ninvoked a metaphor, originating with Raspail, according to which the\ncell is “a kind of laboratory within which all tissues organize\nand grow” (1843: 28; as translated by Harris, 1999: 32). The\nlaboratory metaphor encouraged attempts to develop chemical\nexplanations for all the reactions occurring in cells. There were a\nnumber of variants on this theme. Unger analogized the plant cell with\na “mächtige chemische Werkstätte” (powerful\nchemical workshop) (1851: 23) and Virchow stated that “starch is\ntransformed into sugar in the plant and animal just as it is in a\nfactory” (1858: 107).  \nEmbracing this chemical perspective, several chemists sought to\nidentify the chemical catalysts needed for the reactions to occur.\nFermentation was a common focus and Kühne (1877) coined the term\nenzyme (Greek for “in yeast”) for the putative\ncatalyst operative in yeast. Enthusiasm for this effort was\ntemporarily dampened by Pasteur (1860). A noted chemist, he\nnonetheless maintained that fermentation could only be carried out in\nwhole living cells. This reflects a conception of the cell as an\nexplanatorily irreducible unit of life—a conception associated\nwith vitalism (discussed in more detail below). Enthusiasm for the\nfactory conception, though, was rekindled by Buchner (1897). Guided by\nPasteur’s contention that fermentation could not occur in the\nabsence of cells, he added sugar to an extract he prepared by\ndestroying all whole cells, thinking it would serve as a preservative.\nWhen he observed the emission of bubbles, indicating fermentation in\nthe absence of living cells, he changed course and galvanized the\npursuit of chemical investigations of metabolism that resulted in the\nestablishment of modern biochemistry in the first decades of the\ntwentieth century (Kohler 1971; Cornish-Bowden 1997). One of its early\nsuccesses was the characterization in the 1930s of a pathway of enzyme\ncatalyzed reactions responsible for fermentation (Bechtel 1986). \nAt first the factory metaphor simply identified the cell as the place\nin which chemical reactions occur, but over time researchers began to\nfocus on the different machines within the factory. The focus on\nseparate machines in the factory was promoted in the late nineteenth\nand early twentieth century when, using improved microscopes and\napplying stains to enhance contrast, investigators began to identify\nstructures within cells and theorize about their functional\nsignificance. Researchers were particularly successful in\ncharacterizing the nuclear events in cell division and fertilization.\nFlemming (1879, 1882) described in detail how the threads that he\ncalled chromatin (due to their absorption of dye), later\nnamed chromosomes, divided longitudinally, with the two\nhalves moving apart so that one of each would end up in each daughter\ncell\n (Figure 3).\n Soon after researchers such as Weismann and Correns pointed to links\nbetween chromosome transmission and heredity, but it was Boveri (1902)\nand Sutton (1903) who provided the compelling evidence that\nMendel’s factors (what would soon be called genes) are\nin or on chromosomes. Darden and Maull (1977) analyze the linking of\ngenes to chromosomes as a major example of what they termed\ninterfield theories, theories that do not try to reduce one\naccount to another but integrate the findings of different fields in a\ntheory that bridges them. \nFigure 3: Flemming’s (1882)\ndrawings of the stages of mitosis that highlights the formation of\nspindles and their role in segregating chromosomes. Images 1–3 \nare from Tafel IIIa; 4–7 from Tafel IIIb. (Figure from\n wiki commons.) \nLate in the nineteenth century cytologists also succeeded in\nidentifying membrane-enclosed structures in the cytoplasm that came to\nbe known as organelles. Altmann (1890), using new stains he\ndeveloped, observed filaments within cells that he took to be\nelementary organisms (a view he explicitly set in opposition to the\nprotoplasm theory). Although many researchers challenged\nAltmann’s observations, Benda (1899) confirmed the existence of\nfilaments using a different stain and gave them the name\nmitochondria (Greek for “thread” and\n“granule”). Because of their reactivity with oxidative\nstains, Michaelis (1899) proposed that they figured in oxidative\nreactions in cells. Yet other researchers identified other organelles\nsuch as the Golgi apparatus (Golgi 1898) and ergastoplasm (Garnier\n1897), which was ultimately identified as the endoplasmic\nreticulum. \nIn the early decades in the twentieth century biochemists and\ncytologists developed their own research techniques and pursued their\ninvestigations independently of the other. Most biochemists implicitly\nembraced the assumption that the cell was a bag of chemicals that\ncould be studied in the extracts remaining after cell structure was\ndestroyed whereas those pursuing cytological inquiries tended to\nembrace the factory metaphor in which organelles were distinct\nmachines. As witnessed by Cowdry’s (1924) General\nCytology and Bourne’s (1942) Cytology and Cell\nPhysiology, there were researchers who desired to build bridges\nbetween biochemistry and cytology. There were some techniques, albeit\nlimited, for determining the chemical composition of organelles\n(essentially, those of cytochemistry and histochemistry, which relied\non determining to which chemicals various stains bound). The nearly\nsimultaneous introduction of cell fractionation and electron\nmicroscopy in the late 1940s provided the needed research techniques\nand, as noted in\n Section 1,\n helped establish modern cell biology (Bechtel 2006; Matlin 2018). In\naddition to the linkage of microsomes to the endoplasmic reticulum,\ndescribed above, researchers linked oxidative metabolism to the inner\nmembrane of the mitochondrion. New structures were also discovered and\nconnected to functions, such as the lysosome which was linked to the\nbreakdown and recycling of disrupted cell components (de Duve\n1958). \nThe process of advancing new conceptions of cells continues. We note\njust one example here. The pioneers of cell biology in the 1940s and\n1950s embraced the machines in a factory metaphor, treating cell\norganelles as compartments in which different chemical reactions were\ncatalyzed by the enzymes housed there. Once formed, the compartments,\non this view, did not change—the crucial activities occurred\nwithin them. Over time, however, some researchers within cell biology\nbegan to identify cell structures that executed mechanical movements,\nas anticipated by Flemming’s (1882) characterization of the cell\nspindle as pulling chromosomes apart in mitosis. Of particular\nimportance was research on the cytoskeleton (consisting of actin\nfibres and microtubules). The term cytoskeleton was invoked\nin the 1930s and 1940s to denote a rigid structure, and indeed it does\nhelp give cells their shape. But it was soon found to be the locus of\nmovement. H. E. Huxley (1969) advanced an account of muscle\ncontraction as resulting from myosin molecules forming bridges that\npull on actin filaments. Both actin filaments and microtubules were\nfound to continually extend themselves at one end by incorporating new\nproteins while removing them from the other, a process characterized\nas treadmilling (Cleveland 1982). Video observations of\norganelles moving along microtubules (R. Allen et al. 1982) led to the\ndiscovery of kinesins (Vale, Reese, & Sheetz 1985), molecular\nmotors that walk along microtubules carrying cargo. It also\nfocused new attention on dyneins (Paschal & Vallee 1987),\npreviously only known for their roles in cilia and flagella, as\ncarrying cargo in the opposite direction. Recognition of this\ncontinual movement of material within cells gave rise to a new\nmetaphor of the cell as a city with bustling traffic (Vale &\nMilligan 2000). \nAlmost all of those pursuing the various metaphors discussed in the\nprevious section embraced a view that had its origins in Descartes,\nwho maintained both non-living and living systems (with the exception\nof the human mind) operated like machines. But a significant number of\nresearchers rejected this perspective and maintained that living\norganisms, including cells, are fundamentally different from ordinary\nphysical, mechanical systems. They argued that in one way or another\ncomposition from material components is insufficient to account for\nthe phenomena associated with cells. We begin with these opponents of\nmechanistic conceptions of cells and then examine how those advocating\nmechanistic approaches responded. \nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth century the opponents of mechanism\nwere typically referred to as vitalists. The various\nvitalists all rejected mechanism, taken as the view that organisms are\ncomposed of physical parts that operate in accord with the same\nprinciples as processes in the non-living world. Their positive views\nvaried. Some vitalists adopted a position much like that of substance\ndualists with respect to the mind, arguing that some non-material\ncomponent—a vital force (vis vitalis)—operates in\nliving beings and accounts for their distinctive activities. Others\navoided positing an extra component but maintained that different laws\napply in living organisms than in non-living systems (for discussions\nof these different versions of vitalism, see contributions in\nNormandin & Wolfe 2013). Regardless of how they expressed their\npositive views, vitalists commonly pointed to activities of living\norganisms that they claimed could not be accounted for in the same\nmanner as physical processes. This is well illustrated in Bichat\n(1805), who focused first on the apparent lack of determinism in the\nbehavior of biological organisms and second on the fact that organisms\nseemed to oppose physical processes that threatened to destroy them\n(in his words, they resist death). As noted above, Schwann\nand Pasteur both claimed that living yeast are needed to produce\nfermentation. While for Schwann this only entailed that fermentation\ndepended on the specific combination of materials found in cells, for\nvitalists it entailed that living cells perform activities that could\nnot be performed by the collection of component molecules. Bichat and\nPasteur, as well as other prominent vitalists such as Müller\n(1837–1840), embraced empirical and experimental research, but\ndrew limits with respect to what could be explained by appeal to the\nmaterial components of an organism alone. \nIn many cases, mechanists did not explicitly respond to vitalists but\nsimply moved forward with their research. Bernard (1865), was an\nexception. He addressed Bichat’s challenges by introducing a\ndistinction between an organism’s internal and external\nenvironment. Mechanistic operations within organisms are carried out\nin the internal environment and jointly serve to maintain that\nenvironment in a constant state. Because mechanistic operations\nrespond to conditions in the internal environment, they appear\nindeterminate when considered only in relation to external stimuli.\nMoreover, because these mechanisms work to maintain a constant\ninternal environment, one could explain the ability of organisms to\nresist physical processes that might otherwise destroy them (for\ndiscussions of Bernard see Holmes 1974 and LaFollette & Shanks\n1994). Bernard’s approach was the foundation for Cannon’s\nlater well-known work on homeostasis (1929). \nBy the beginning of the twentieth century few biologists investigating\ncells (Driesch, 1914,\nbeing a notable exception) espoused vital forces and vitalism per\nse ceased to be regarded as a tenable position. But many\nbiologists were still concerned to account for differences between\nliving cells and ordinary material systems. A prominent position\nadopted by many investigators (Haldane 1929, 1931; Lillie 1934;\nNeedham 1936; Russell 1945, 1930; Von Bertalanffy 1952; Weiss 1963;\nWoodger 1929) was holism, sometimes referred to as\norganicism. (See Nicholson and Gawne 2015, for a discussion\nof how the organicists differentiated their position from both\nvitalism and mechanism.) Holists accepted that living systems were\nbuilt out of material parts. They insisted, however, that the\nactivities performed by components of living systems depended not just\non those components and their composition but on their organization.\nAccordingly, one cannot just add together the activities of the\ncomponents to account for the whole (“the whole is not just the\nsum of its parts”). The organized whole in part determines how\nthe parts behave. This attitude is manifest, for example, in J. S.\nHaldane’s opposition to investigating the origins of life from\nnon-living matter: “There is and can be no origin of life out of\nmechanical conditions. Such an origin is inconceivable” (Haldane\n1930: 12). \nThe organization of cellular systems plays a central role in the\ndialectic between mechanistic biologists and holists. Holists often\nconstrue mechanistic biologists as downplaying the importance of\norganization, but many mechanistic biologists deny this. Bernard had\nemphasized the role of organization in allowing components to maintain\nthe constancy of the internal environment and those seeking to explain\nhomeostasis appealed to feedback loops. Recognizing that mechanistic\naccounts are not limited to a simple, additive view of organization,\nJ. S. Haldane’s son, J. B. S. Haldane, abandoned his\nfather’s commitment to holism and embraced a mechanistic\nframework that emphasized how biological components are affected by\nbeing incorporated within organized systems. In making this break with\nhis father he was heavily influenced by working with the biochemist\nHopkins (1913), who likewise made organization central to his accounts\nof biochemical processes. Accordingly, J. B. S. Haldane became one of\nthe pioneers in formulating biological inquiry into the origins of\nlife while still insisting that complex organization figured centrally\nin activities of living organisms (Martin 2010). \nPhilosophers and scientists often invoke the word emergent\nfor phenomena that are different from the phenomena generated by their\ncomponents (see the entry on\n emergent properties).\n Sometimes emergent phenomena are viewed as incapable of being\nexplained in terms of their constituents. In the context of\ncharacterizing systems biological accounts of cell phenomena, Boogerd\net al. (2005) develop an account according to which emergent phenomena\nare ones that are fully explicable in terms of how their constituents\nbehave in the organized system, but not in terms of how they behave in\nsimpler (less complexly organized) systems. This recognizes that many\ncellular constituents behave differently when incorporated into\nparticular systems in which they receive distinctive inputs. For other\nrecent treatments of emergence and its applications to cell biology,\nsee (Hooker 2011a; S.\nMitchell 2012; Mossio, Bich, & Moreno 2013; Winning & Bechtel\n2019). \nThe desire to understand how the organization in cells and\nmulticellular organisms differs from that found in most naturally\noccurring systems or human-made artifacts motivated a body of research\nin theoretical biology in the 1970s and 1980s. Among the most\nprominent contributors to theoretical biology were Pattee (many of his\nmost important papers have been collected in Pattee 2012), Rosen\n(1985, 1991), Polanyi (1968), and Waddington (1961). Philosophy of\nbiology, as it developed as a specialty in philosophy of science in\nthe 1970s and 1980s, largely ignored this tradition. Today however a\nnumber of philosophers concerned with cell biology are drawing upon\nits insights. Here we focus on one key conceptual tool theoretical\nbiologists provide for understanding the distinctive activities of\nliving systems such as cells: constraints. The notion of constraint is\ndrawn from classical mechanics, where constraints serve to constitute\nmacro-scale objects from their micro-scale particles. Constraints thus\naccount for why macro-scale objects exhibit different properties than\ntheir constituents. Constraints are not explained by laws but rather\nserve as boundary conditions that must be ascertained empirically.\nAccordingly, to the degree constraints explain biological activities\nof cells, these activities cannot be reduced, in the sense of being\nderived from the principles of chemistry or physics. Instead,\nresearchers must, on the basis of empirical inquiry, identify the\nconstraints actually realized in living cells. \nThe importance of constraints for understanding cellular and other\nbiological phenomena has been developed recently by Hooker (2011b, 2013) and Moreno and Mossio\n(2015). Hooker makes clear that, although the term constraint\nsuggests limitations, constraints also extend possibilities—to\noffer a cellular example, microtubules that run from the cell center\nto the periphery restrict the movement of the kinesin and dynein\nmotors that move on them but also provide a possibility for transport\nof organelles to distant locations. Moreno and Mossio in particular\ndevelop a perspective that links the focus on constraints to the idea\nthat living cells are autopoietic. Drawing upon Maturana and\nVarela’s (1980) conception of living systems as autopoietic\nmachines—machines that provide a network of production that\nenables the construction of the living system—Moreno and Mossio\nadd a focus on the thermodynamic requirements of cells. Cells, as\nhighly organized systems, are far from equilibrium and require a\ncontinual source of free energy to carry out the operations required\nto synthesize new components and resist the tendency towards\nequilibrium. What constraints do in organisms, on their account, is\ndirect flows of free energy to perform the work of building,\nrepairing, and reproducing the organism. \nSome constraints are flexible, and these make possible an important\nfeature of living systems—the ability of organisms to control\nproduction mechanisms (such as those involve in fermentation or muscle\ncontraction) through the actions of \ncontrol mechanisms. On Pattee’s account, control mechanisms\nchange the flexible constraints in production mechanisms in\nlight of information that is procured by making measurements. Negative\nfeedback control mechanisms, such as thermostats, are simple examples:\nthe thermostat makes a measurement of a variable (temperature in the\nroom) that is affected by the operation of the production\nmechanisms—the furnace—and based on the measurement\nexecutes action on the constraints in the furnace mechanism. Examples\nof feedback control mechanisms are widespread in cells. Some of the\nbest-known examples are the lac operon (Jacob & Monod\n1961) and feedback control of glycolysis by ATP (Ghosh & Chance\n1964). The measurements used by control systems need not be restricted\nto states affected by the activity of the production mechanism; they\ncan also measure states in the organism or states in its environment.\nUsing such measurements, production mechanisms can be controlled so as\nto operate only in particular circumstances, enabling the organism,\nfor example, to navigate to a food source or avoid a predator as\nneeded. \nMoreno and Mossio (2015) offer an account in which appropriately\norganized productive and control mechanisms enable cells, and by\nextension multi-cellular organisms, to achieve what they refer to as\nbiological autonomy:  \na distinctive regime of causation, able not only of producing and\nmaintaining the parts that contribute to the functioning of the system\nas an integrated, operational, and topologically distinct whole but\nalso able to promote the conditions of its own existence through its\ninteraction with the environment. (2015: xvi–xvii)  \nNote that mechanisms, on this view, are contained within cells and\nthat it is cells, not mechanisms that are autonomous. What becomes\ncrucial for understanding the autonomy of cells is the organization of\ncontrol mechanisms that orchestrate the activities of various\nproductive mechanisms so as to maintain the cell (or the multicellular\norganism). One notable feature of this focus on the organization\nneeded to maintain autonomy is that it is compatible with the more\ntraditional philosophical accounts of mechanism (discussed in\n section 5)\n but emphasizes a feature not prominent in them—that production\nmechanisms are subject to control mechanisms. To understand the\nbehavior of cellular mechanisms, researchers must not only look inside\nmechanisms to their organized parts and operations but outside to how\nthey are situated in cells and organisms in such a way that they can\nbe controlled by other mechanisms (Winning & Bechtel 2018; Bechtel\nin press). Such an ontological framework for understanding cells (as\nwell as multicellular organisms) integrates insights from traditional\nmechanists in biology and their vitalist/organicist/holist critics,\ncapturing what is distinctive of living organisms within a framework\nthat accepts them as consisting of mechanisms, but mechanisms\norganized in appropriate ways. \nWe turn now from questions about the ontological status of cells to\nepistemic questions about how scientists study them. We begin with how\nscientists represent cells and information about them. Traditionally,\nphilosophy of science has focused on linguistic representations of\nscientific knowledge. But in many fields of biology and especially in\ncell biology, information is often presented in images.\nScientists’ very familiarity with cells results from visual\nrepresentations generated using microscopes. Developing microscopes\nand techniques for using them to produce interpretable images\npresented a number of challenges. We begin in section 4.1 with the\nchallenges in generating images (micrographs) at all and in section\n4.2 consider challenges in evaluating the reliability of the resulting\nimages. Beyond these replete (highly detailed) representations, cell\nbiologists rely on a variety of less replete diagrams. (The\ncharacterization of images as “replete” is due to Perini,\n2013. Drawing on Goodman, she uses relative repleteness to\ndifferentiate diagrams from pictures.) In particular, as discussed in\n section 4.3,\n when they are developing mechanistic hypotheses about cells, cell\nbiologists rely on cell diagrams that represent types of cell\ncomponents and mechanism diagrams that represent select components\nwithin cells that are hypothesized to constitute parts of the\nmechanism responsible for a given phenomenon (Downes 1992). \nAs discussed above, in the seventeenth century both Hooke and van\nLeeuwenhoek pioneered the use of light microscopes to observe cells.\nSubsequent investigators often designed their own microscopes. The\nvariations in these designs contributed to variability in the\nresulting images. (Before photography, microscopists drew what they\nsaw using the microscope, introducing another source of variation.)\nThe variability of the images different researchers produced was one\nfactor that led biologists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nto examine more carefully the processes through which microscopes\ngenerate images (Schickore 2001, 2007). In his theoretical studies of\nlenses, Newton (1704) characterized two types of aberrations created\nby lenses: spherical aberrations, resulting from light rays coming\ninto focus at different points, and chromatic aberrations, resulting\nfrom light of different wavelengths being refracted at different\nangles. Schickore (2007) describes the many efforts by microscope\ndevelopers to correct for these aberrations and the creation of test\nobjects for evaluating the reliability of particular microscopes.\nDuring the same time enthusiasts were advancing many claims about what\nthey saw, some of which were shown later to be artifacts. For example,\nboth Milne-Edwards (1823) and Dutrochet (1824) reported round\nstructures of a constant size similar to that reported for cells,\nwhich they termed globules. (See Schickore 2009 for a\ndetailed examination of the reports of globules and an argument that\nit was the variability in these reports that contributed to the\ngrowing sense that something was amiss in the practices of the\nmicroscopists.) Globules were, however, soon shown to be the products\nof spherical aberrations. In the early nineteenth century several lens\nmakers developed strategies for eliminating spherical aberrations and\ngreatly limiting chromatic aberration (chromatic aberrations were not\nfully eliminated until the introduction of the apochromatic lenses in\nmid-century). As a result, the observations by Schleiden, Schwann, and\nothers discussed above were largely free of these distortions. \nLight microscopes faced another limit, that on magnification (a\nlimitation imposed by the wave length of light). For cell researchers\nto obtain higher-resolution images that could reveal constituents of\ncells, a microscope relying on different physical principles was\nrequired. The most important alternative to the light microscope for\nstudying cells was the (transmission) electron microscope, which\nemploys beams of electrons to create images in a manner comparable to\nphotography: locations on the photographic plate hit by many electrons\nare black in the negative and white in the positive image. When\nstructures in the cell scatter electrons, the location in the negative\nremains white and appears dark in the positive image. Although\nelectron microscopes were available in the early 1930s, only in the\nyears just before and during World War II did biologists begin to\nexplore their potential. One difficulty they confronted is that most\neukaryotic cells are too thick to be penetrated by the 50kV electron\nbeam available in the first electron microscopes. Microtomes had been\ndeveloped for cutting slices of cells for light microscopy, but new\napproaches to microtome design were required to slice cells\nsufficiently thinly without creating distortions. This problem was not\nsolved until the early 1950s (Porter & Blum 1953). Accordingly,\nsome of the first electron micrograph studies focused on fibrous\nmaterial such as collagen (Schmitt, Hall, & Jakus 1942) or on\nbacteria (Stanley & Anderson 1941). Porter, Claude, and Fullam\n(1945) created the first electron micrograph of a eukaryotic cell by\nculturing it under conditions where the periphery spread very thinly,\nallowing electrons to penetrate. They generated an image\n (Figure 4)\n that showed at the periphery  \nfilamentous mitochondria of various lengths and fairly constant width;\nscattered, small elements of high density especially abundant around\nthe nucleus and presumably representing Golgi bodies; and a delicate\nlace-work extending throughout the cytoplasm. (1945: 246) \nFigure 4: Comparison of images of\nfibroblast from a tissue cultured chick embryo as seen with electron\nmicroscope (left) and light microscope (right). From Porter, Claude,\nand Fullam (1945: plate 10). \nBesides the challenge of creating preparations sufficiently thin to be\npenetrated by the electron beam, researchers confronted a number of\nother challenges in preparing biological material for electron\nmicroscopy. For example, specimens must be placed in vacuum, and this\nrequires first removing all water, the primary constituent of cells,\nwithout inducing to many distortions. Several historians and\nphilosophers (Rheinberger 1995, Rasmussen 1997, and Bechtel 2006) have\nexamined how biologists confronted these challenges and evaluated the\nreliability of the resulting micrographs. How they addressed one\nchallenge—that of creating sufficient contrast in the\nimages—greatly affected the images that were produced. This was\nalready a challenge with light microscopy: cell material is mostly\ntranslucent so that the light transmitted is mostly of the same\nwavelength, making it hard to differentiate the various structures in\nthe image. To address the challenge, light microscopists in the\nmid-nineteenth century began experimenting with dyes used for fabrics.\nAs noted in\n Section 2,\n Flemming named the nuclear structures he observed chromatin since\nthey bound the aniline dye he was using. The problem for electron\nmicroscopy was similar—cell components differ little in their\nability to block electron transmission. Electron microscopists found\nthat several of the fixatives used in light microscopy, especially\nthose involving heavy metals, enhanced the ability to block electrons,\nand accordingly the contrast in the resulting images. Given that there\nwas little knowledge about what given chemicals would bind to within\nthe cell, the investigation of these stains was mostly pursued by\nresearchers trying out different compounds and procedures for applying\nthem (exemplified in Palade’s 1952, study of osmium tetroxide)\nto see what images they could generate. Indeed, different stains\n(osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, etc.) did yield different\nimages. \nSince there was little understanding about what stains bound to,\nskeptics often raised doubts that they were revealing actual\nstructures in cells. Bechtel (2000, 2006) highlights three\nconsiderations that often figured in scientists’ evaluation of\nwhether micrographs were informative about cells or only artifacts of\nthe methods of preparation: (1) the quality of the micrographs\nthemselves—do they exhibit distinct patterns? (2) the robustness\nof the results—can comparable results be generated with\ndifferent techniques (e.g., with light and electron microscopy or with\nmultiple stains)? and (3) the theoretical plausibility of the\nresults—do they fit into a coherent theoretical account? While\nthe first is seldom commented on in philosophical accounts, it is\nnotable that scientists are inclined to assume that if an image\nreveals a distinct, replicable pattern, it reflects something in the\nsource (although this assessment may be retracted if, for example, a\nresearcher shows how the pattern could be generated by other means).\nThere has been extensive philosophical discussion of the\nsecond—the inference that when the same result is generated by\nindependent means, it reflects a preexisting entity in the world\n(Hacking 1983; Culp 1995; Stegenga & Menon 2017). However, this\ncriterion proves insufficient at just the point at which results with\nnew techniques, such as the electron microscope, are most\ncontroversial—when the images contain structures beyond those\nthat can be detected with other existing techniques. In these cases,\nthe distinctness of the patterns together with considerations as to\nthe theoretical plausibility of the findings are the criteria\nresearchers can use. Appeal to theoretical plausibility, however,\nwould seem to be circular since in traditional philosophical accounts,\ntheories are tested by the evidence generated by the technique. But\ndeveloping a plausible theory that fits with an experimental finding\nand other evidence is not easy and when they are able to do so,\nscientists view it as buttressing their judgments that the images\nreflect real structures. To illustrate how these considerations have\nbeen invoked in in cell biology, we present two examples philosophers\nhave examined of conflicts over whether the structure shown in\nmicroscopic images was real or an artifact. The cases ended\ndifferently, one with the acceptance of the structure, one with its\nrejection. \nThe first case involves the Golgi apparatus, first described by Golgi\n(1898) in light microscope studies using the silver nitrate stain he\nhad introduced. Palade and Claude (1949a,b), two of the pioneers of\nmodern cell biology, who would ultimately share the Nobel Prize,\nargued that it was an artifact of staining, including with osmium\ntetroxide (which Palade helped establish as a primary stain for\nelectron microscopy). They appealed not only to the variable\nappearance of the Golgi bodies, as had some earlier skeptics\n(Strangeways & Canti 1927; Parat 1928; Baker 1944), but also to\ntheir own ability to create myelin figures similar in appearance to\nthe Golgi bodies by adding osmium to egg white. As discussed by\nBechtel (2006), this is compelling evidence for the claim that the\nGolgi apparatus is an artifact, but in this case the evidence was\neventually set aside without being refuted. Although Palade remained a\nskeptic about the Golgi apparatus for 15 years (researchers in his lab\nreported that they were not allowed to mention it during that\ninterval), he finally accepted its reality when researchers in his\nlaboratory demonstrated that many newly synthesized proteins pass\nthrough the region of the cell where the Golgi apparatus appeared on\ntheir way to being secreted. He did not, however, explain why he\nchanged his mind. This later research on the Golgi apparatus, but not\nhis earlier skepticism about the existence of the Golgi apparatus, was\nnoted in Palade’s Nobel Prize citation in 1974. Palade himself\nlater contributed to two reviews (Farquhar & Palade 1981, 1998)\nthat discuss earlier researchers who cast doubts on the reality of the\nGolgi apparatus, but he never mentions his own claims that it was an\nartifact. What seems particularly salient is that, as a result of\nresearch in his laboratory, the Golgi apparatus was associated with a\nfunction in the cell in a manner that it had not been previously. It\nnow fit into a plausible theory in which it figured in packaging\nproteins for export from the cell. Bechtel argues that this is often a\nmajor factor in researchers’ acceptance of the reality of\nentities identified through new techniques. \nThe second example stems from early electron microscopy of bacterial\ncells. Chapman and Hillier (1953) observed invaginations of the plasma\nmembrane in gram-negative bacteria, which they called peripheral\nbodies. Robertson (1958) renamed them mesosomes and they\nwere implicated by many researchers in a variety of cell functions\nbefore being rejected as artifacts in the 1970s (Silva et al. 1976).\nAnalyzing this example, Rasmussen (1993) argues that philosophical\ncriteria for distinguishing real entities from artifacts, such as\nrobustness, are insufficient to explain scientists’ changing\njudgments about the mesosome. When Chapman and Hillier first made\ntheir case for the existence of mesosomes, they had to explain away\ndifferences between their micrographs and the observations of light\nmicroscopists by arguing that a membrane that only appeared in images\nwith the light microscope was in fact due to the mesosomes being\nimaged under low resolution. Rasmussen contends they offered this\nconvoluted argument rather than treating the mesosomes as an artifact\nbecause they were promoting the new electron microscopes. He further\ndescribes how their claims motivated research programs aimed at\npurifying and biochemically characterizing the mesosome so as to\nevaluate proposals regarding their function. This initially supported\nclaims to the mesosome’s reality, but other biochemists offered\nconflicting evidence. In addition, another new technique for preparing\nspecimens for electron microscopy by freezing them, which had its own\npassionate advocates, generated micrographs that did not show\nmesosomes. According to Rasmussen, these competing findings, not\nrobustness, determined scientists’ judgments about\nmesosomes. \nThe case of the mesosome has attracted substantial interest from other\nphilosophers of science. Culp (1994) challenged Rasmussen’s\ninterpretation of the history of mesosomes, contending that the\nrejection of mesosomes as an artifact is in fact best explained on\ngrounds of robustness. In particular, she points to the combined data\nfrom biochemists that revealed few differences between cytoplasmic\nmembranes and specimens supposedly from mesosomes and from a new\ngeneration of electron microscopists that suggested that mesosomes\nresulted from the fixative, glutaraldehyde, used to generate the\nmicrographs purporting to show them. These robustness considerations,\nshe claims, sufficed to lead the community to reject mesosomes. In a\nlater paper, Rasmussen responds to Culp’s analysis, continuing\nto maintain that local details, not principles like robustness,\ndetermine scientists’ judgments about artifacts:  \ngeneral principles like robustness are too vague to warrant anything\nwhatsoever, because when described in sufficient detail it emerges\nthat the way such principles are instantiated is in flux—and the\ndevil is in the details. (2001: 643)  \nSeveral other philosophers have also taken up the case of the\nmesosome. Allchin (2000) characterizes the initial evidence for the\nmesosome as robust and describes how subsequent research showing how\nparticles were generated by degeneration of the membrane in\npreparation for electron microscopy led to a reassessment, culminating\nin mesosomes being recognized as artifacts. Weber (2005) argues that\nthe process of evaluating claims about artifacts employs causal\nreasoning of the same sort as used in testing theoretical hypotheses.\nAccording to him, mesosomes were judged to be artifacts when evidence\nsupported the claim that they were produced by chemical fixation.\nHudson (2014: chapter 2) advances yet another alternative: according\nto which what mattered most to researchers was whether they regarded\nthe process for generating evidence for or against mesosomes as a\nreliable process. \nMicroscopic images, whether hand-drawn, as they were in the nineteenth\ncentury, or captured in photographs, are highly detailed. However, the\nknowledge cytologists and cell biologists seek to develop is more\nabstract and general—they seek to identify the types of\nstructures found in cells, not all their instances. Accordingly, cell\nbiologists frequently generate diagrams that leave out details.\nMaienschein (1991) examines the origin of this practice in\nWilson’s (1896) classic text, The Cell in Development and\nInheritance. Early in the book Wilson provided a diagram\n (Figure 5A)\n which abstracts from the much more replete photographs he had\npresented just a year earlier (Wilson 1895). Instead of showing all\nthe instances of different organelles, he presents just a few\ninstances of each type. Organelles are shown using icons that are\nsuggestive of their shapes. Such diagrams serve to convey the types of\norganelles found in cells and their typical location, but falsely\nsuggest that most of the space in the cell is empty. Maienschein\ncontends that this transition from photographs to abstract diagrams\nreflects Wilson’s growing confidence in the correctness of his\ninterpretation of what he was seeing through the microscope and a\ntransition “from presenting data to representing\ntheory” (Maienschein 1991: 252). A\nsign of their theoretical status is that such figures, unlike\nmicrographs or data plots, often undergo numerous revisions as\nscientists develop their account. Revising these diagrams is a means,\nin fact, of developing theory. With the development of biochemical and\nmolecular accounts of cell phenomena, researchers often make what\nSerpente (2011) characterizes as a transition from the iconic to the\nsymbolic. He presents protein-protein interaction maps and gene\nregulatory diagrams as examples of symbolic representations. \nA. Wilson’s (1896: 14, figure 5)\ncell diagram that leaves out much of the detail that would be seen\nthrough the microscope to focus on  \nB. A mechanism diagram of the processes\nof heterophagy and autophagy from de Duve and Wattiaux (1966: 468,\nfigure 6). \nFigure 5  \nSimilar points also apply to another type of diagram that appears\nfrequently in cell biology—diagrams of hypothesized mechanisms\nthat are taken to be responsible for a particular phenomenon (Sheredos\net al. 2013; Abrahamsen, Sheredos, & Bechtel 2018). Such diagrams\ndo not try to show all the organelle types but, as in\n Figure 5B,\n only those thought to be involved in generating a particular\nphenomenon—in this case, the breakdown of materials taken into\nthe cell (heterophagy) or of cell components themselves (autophagy).\nOne challenge with mechanism diagrams is that they are static whereas\nmechanisms are engaged in change (the digestion of organelles and the\nexpulsion of the remaining material). One common strategy is to use\narrows to represent activities, although often within the same diagram\narrows may have multiple different meanings. Ultimately, however, it\nis up to the viewer to animate a mechanism diagram (Hegarty\n1992)—to rehearse mentally the different activities that are\nrepresented and to imagine the changes that are being produced by\ndifferent parts. \nOne might think that diagrams are only important as a means of\nillustrating results that are presented textually. But examination of\nthe practices of scientists reveals that they are far more central to\ntheir reasoning. Early in the development of a mechanistic hypothesis\nscientists sketch their ideas. Often mechanism diagrams (as well as\nthe other figures that show data or the workflow of the research) are\ncrafted long before text is drafted. Diagrams are commonly presented\nin lab meetings and revised multiple times as scientists are refining\ntheir claims. Researchers often generate the text of the paper only at\nthe end of this process. Taking advantage of access to the draft\nfigures and text for two research projects, Sheredos and Bechtel\n(2017, in press) examined the process of interactive engagement in\nwhich the investigators modified diagrams, changed text, and then\nfurther modified the diagram. What this process suggests is that\nsketching and resketching mechanisms plays a central role as\nresearchers seek to identify what they can conclude from their\nexperimental studies. In one of the cases they examined, an early\nversion of a diagram serves to pose a question that was addressed\nthrough the experimental studies, resulting in a final diagram that\noffers an answer to the question posed. Beyond supporting the\nempirical claims of a research project, Jones and Wolkenhauer (2012)\nprovide an illuminating discussion of how diagrams serve to locate\ninformation required for a computational model in a representation of\nthe cellular mechanism that is being modeled, \nHistorically prominent philosophers of science such as Popper and\nReichenbach rejected inquiries into how scientific theories are\ndiscovered as not philosophical (see the entry on\n scientific discovery).\n Beginning with Hanson (1958), though, discovery has attracted the\ninterest of many philosophers of science. Investigations into\ndiscovery in cell biology (and related fields such as biochemistry,\nmolecular biology, and neuroscience) inspired Bechtel and Richardson\n(1993 [2010]) to argue that the goal in these fields was not to\nconstruct nomological explanation (Hempel 1965) but rather to identify\nthe mechanism responsible for a phenomenon and determine how it\nworked. Examples from cell biology have also figured prominently in\naccounts of mechanistic explanation by Machamer, Darden, and Craver\n(2000), Craver and Darden (2013), Bechtel (2006), and others (see\nGlennan & Illari, 2018, for a compendium of contemporary accounts\nof mechanisms and mechanistic explanation, and the entry\n mechanisms in science).\n The concept mechanism figures both in discussion of\nontological issues and epistemic issues, but the two uses can be\ndistinguished in the manner proposed by G. Allen (2005). In this\nsection we are concerned with what he called “operative or\nexplanatory mechanism” (2005: 261; the thesis that for\nexplanatory purposes components of cells should be conceived to\nfunction as if they were machines);\n Section 3\n concerned “philosophical mechanism” (2005: 261; the\nontological thesis that organisms are or are constituted by\nmachines). \nOne of the central objectives of many philosophers of science focused\non mechanistic explanations is to characterize reasoning strategies or\nheuristics that scientists use to develop mechanistic explanations\n(Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010]; Craver & Darden 2013; Gross\n2018). We discuss reasoning strategies that figure in different phases\nof developing mechanistic explanations in cell biology: delineating\nphenomena and situating them in responsible mechanisms, identifying\nand characterizing the components of mechanisms (a reductionistic\nphase), and determining the organization within mechanisms and between\nmechanisms and their contexts (a more holistic phase). \nChallenging the common characterization of explanations as explaining\ndata, Bogen and Woodward advanced the claim that scientific\nexplanations are targeted at phenomena. Instead of defining what\nphenomena are, they give examples: “weak neutral currents, the\ndecay of the proton, and chunking and recency effects in human\nmemory” (1988: 306). From these examples, it is clear that Bogen\nand Woodward understand phenomena to be repeatable processes that can\nbe observationally or experimentally detected in multiple ways. On\nthis characterization, cell activities such as protein synthesis or\ncell division count as cellular phenomena. Although phenomena are\noften construed as the starting point of research, Craver and Darden\n(2013: Chapter 4) identify some of the experimental tasks involved in\ncharacterizing phenomena such as identifying precipitating conditions,\nmanifestations, inhibiting conditions, modulating conditions, and\nnonstandard conditions that alter the manifestation of the phenomenon.\nThey also emphasize the role of multiple experimental techniques in\nspecifying features of phenomena. A good deal of research in cell\nbiology is devoted to determining conditions under which cell\nphenomena such as programmed cell death are initiated or inhibited and\ncell biologists have been inventive in developing experimental\ntechniques needed to produce these phenomena. Bechtel (forthcoming)\npoints out that phenomena that are the target of explanation range\nfrom highly specific (protein synthesis in liver cells under low\noxygen conditions) to much more general (protein synthesis\ngenerically). Individual research projects often address highly\nspecific phenomena whereas textbooks or review articles discuss more\ngeneral phenomena. \nWhile some account of the phenomenon under study is generally adopted\nbefore researchers set out to identify the responsible mechanism, the\ncharacterization often changes radically as research on the\nresponsible mechanism proceeds (Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010],\nrefer to researchers reconstituting the phenomenon). This is\nillustrated with an example from the study of cells. A starting point\nfor early inquiries into how animals store energy for their activities\nfocused on the heat generated by metabolizing foodstuffs. This heat\nwas assumed to power other activities and approximately a hundred\nyears of research was devoted to explaining animal heat (see\nMendelsohn 1964). However, after Lohmann (1929) and Fiske and Subbarow\n(1929) had identified adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and demonstrated\nthat when hydrolyzed it would release considerable energy, heat was\ndetermined to be just a waste product of metabolism and researchers\ninstead focused on the synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP. This became\nthe reconstituted phenomenon to which much of the older research was\nnow applied. \nWhat is distinctive of mechanistic explanations is that they decompose\nmechanisms into parts or entities and the operations or activities\nthat contribute to realizing the phenomenon. Although sometimes\nresearchers can proceed by reasoning a priori about what\ncomponent activities would be required to produce a given phenomenon,\nmost often the decomposition is developed on the basis of experiments.\nWhile the goal is to identify both parts and operations and to link\nthem, a given group of researchers may only have research techniques\nthat allow them to identify one or the other. This was the case in\ncell biology. As discussed in\n Section 1,\n microscopic research enabled researchers to identify component parts\n(organelles) of cells, but except for indirect clues such as shape or\nthe ability of an organelle to take up a stain, these researchers were\nunable to procure information about the functions they performed.\nBiochemists on the other hand were able to identify reactions involved\nin many cell activities, but since they studied these in chemical\nsoups made by grinding up the cell, they were not able to link these\nto cell structures. Cell biology developed with the introduction of\nnew techniques such as cell fractionation and electron microscopy that\nopened up the possibility of localizing biochemical reactions in\norganelles. \nIt is worth emphasizing that the sense in which decomposition is\nreductionistic is very different from that involved in more\ntraditional philosophical accounts of theory reduction, which involves\nthe derivation of one theory from another (Nagel 1961; see the entries\non\n scientific reduction\n and\n reductionism in biology).\n Researchers pursue decomposition without assuming the existence of\nfull theories at either level or that a theory at one level can be\nderived from one at a lower level. Moreover, in pursuing decomposition\nresearchers typically do not assume that knowledge of the lower-level\ncomponents is sufficient for explaining the phenomena—at a\nminimum, they recognize that how the components are organized is also\nimportant. The association of a cell process with a specific enzyme is\nnot the end of the explanatory process—the activity of enzymes\nis often affected by the context in which the enzyme exists, for\nexample, in a membrane. For this reason, researchers value in\nvitro reconstitution experiments in establishing that they have\ncorrectly accounted for a phenomenon. \nAllchin (1996, 2007) and Weber (2002), analyze an important\nreconstitution experiment at the interface of cell biology and\nbiochemistry that played a major role in resolving a conflict between\ntwo opposing accounts of the synthesis of ATP in oxidative metabolism.\nBiochemists spent a couple decades trying to identify a purely\nchemical pathway that used the energy released in oxidative metabolism\nto synthesize ATP (as happens in glycolysis). P. Mitchell (1961)\nadvanced an alternative, chemiosmotic hypothesis according to which\nenergy was transferred via the creation of a proton gradient over a\nmembrane. Kagawa and Racker (1966) had already linked ATP synthase to\nsmall knobs on the inner mitochondrial membrane but it was an\nin vitro chimeric system combining fragments from bacteria,\nplants, and animals created by Racker and Stoeckenius (1974) that\ndemonstrated that energy could first be captured in a proton gradient\nand then used in mitochondria to synthesize ATP. Unlike purely\nbiochemical accounts that discounted cell structure, this research\nshowed the importance of not just enzymes but how they are situated\nwith respect to cell structures in explaining cellular phenomena.  \nEven in chemical soups individual molecules are arranged in a\nparticular pattern. This pattern affects, for example, which molecule\nencounters another. When analyzing such soups, however, chemists do\nnot try to decipher the arrangement but instead rely on statistical\nmeasures about the likelihood of encounters. But cells are\ndifferent—different molecules are segregated in different\nlocations and how they are organized affects the resulting behavior\n(this is true even in prokaryotic cells that lack internal membranes,\nwith molecules segregated in different parts of the cell, sometimes\nchanging location over the course of a day; see Cohen, Erb,\nSelimkhanov, et al., 2014). Organization is also important in\nmanufactured products. If the parts of your computer were distributed\non your desk, and each part was provided with some input so that it\nwas performing an operation, the parts would still not carry out the\nsame activities as they do when they are in their proper arrangement.\nOrganization ensures that the outputs of one component are passed to\nthe appropriate others as inputs. The importance of organization is\nfurther recognized when one considers that what human designers do is\nimpose new organization on existing components to achieve novel\ndesired effects. Evolution often does the same in biology. \nOrganization is especially important for attempts to understand the\nactivities of cells but, until recently, cell biologists have had\nlimited tools for determining organization. At a coarse-grained level,\nthe combination of cell fractionation and electron microscopy provided\ninformation about organization and this provided insight into how\ncells perform their activities. For example, recognizing that enzymes\nthat can break apart cell components are segregated from the rest of\nthe cell within the lysosome explains why they only carry out their\nactivities on structures that are first transported into the lysosome.\nAnd knowing that a collection of enzymes is localized in an adjacent\nmembrane explains how products of one reaction are readily taken up in\nanother. In these cases the organization realized in cells and its\nconsequences can be characterized qualitatively and presented in a\nmechanism diagram, as discussed in\n section 4.3.\n In other cases, however, the organization is more complex than can be\ndescribed in such qualitative terms. Especially when components are\norganized into feedback loops, and the individual operations are\ncharacterized in nonlinear functions, cell biologists turn to\ncomputational models to understand their behavior. Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen (2010) and Brigandt (2013) describe a number of examples\nfrom recent research on cell phenomena that require computational\nmodels and refer to the resulting explanations that apply dynamical\nanalysis to mechanistic accounts as “dynamical mechanistic\nexplanations”. Using computational modeling of spindle formation\nin cell division as an example, Gross (2018) shows how computational\nmodels can go beyond what has been established experimentally and\nserve as heuristics guiding further research. \nIn recent years cell biologists have acquired new tools for studying\norganization, many of these advanced in systems biology (Green 2017;\nsee the entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n One approach in systems biology seeks to develop comprehensive\ndetailed models of the numerous components identified as involved in\nspecific phenomena (Gross & Green 2017). High-throughput data\nabout, for example, which proteins in a cell can bind to each other or\nwhich pairs of genes, when mutated together, are lethal, has massively\nincreased the number of cell components associated with any given\nphenomenon. To make sense of this cell researchers often seek abstract\nmodels by constructing networks in which nodes stand for entities and\nedges for interactions between entities (Green et al. 2018). The\nchallenge researchers face is to make sense of these\nnetworks—given the large number of entities involved and their\nmany interactions, these networks can often appear as hairballs. We\nbriefly consider two strategies for analyzing networks in cell biology\nthat philosophers have analyzed. \nAlon and his collaborators, focusing on gene transcription networks and metabolic\nnetworks in bacteria and yeast, identified “recurring,\nsignificant patterns of interconnections” involving two, three, or four\nnodes, which they called motifs (Milo et al., 2002: 824). One example, occurring in\n“hundreds of non-homologous gene systems” (Mangan,\nZaslaver, & Alon 2003: 197) in the transcription network of E.\ncoli, is the feedforward loop. In a feedforward loop\n (Figure 6),\n one unit sends inputs to two other units, the first of which also\nsends an input to the other, which serves as the final output unit.\nUsing Boolean models, Alon and his colleagues demonstrated that\ndepending on whether the connections are excitatory or inhibitory,\nsuch a motif can perform a number of different functions. For example,\nif all the connections are excitatory and the final output unit is\nonly active when it receives input from both of the other units (the\nconnections to it constitute an AND-gate, as shown on the left in\n Figure 6),\n then the feedforward loop functions as a persistence\ndetector—the output unit only becomes active when the input to\nthe first unit endures at least until the second unit becomes active.\nThis, as Mangan et al. explain, protects the output (which might serve\nto start the transcription of a gene) from being generated in response\nto random noise presented to the input unit. The feedforward loop and\nAlon’s other motifs are characterized abstractly without\nspecific reference to what entities and interactions correspond to the\nnodes and edges. Philosophers who have examined this research refer to\nthese organizational patterns as design principles (Green\n2015; Green, Levy, & Bechtel 2015; Levy & Bechtel 2013). \nFigure 6: Three examples of feedforward\nloops studied by Alon and his colleagues \nThe second strategy employs computational tools such as cluster\nanalysis to find collections of nodes that are especially highly\ninterconnected. To interpret these clusters in terms of mechanisms\noperative in the cell, researchers often align them with Gene Ontology\n(GO), a resource that was developed to represent published information\nabout cell components, molecular functions, and biological processes\nin directed acyclic graphs so as to facilitate communication between\nresearchers working on different species (Ashburner et al. 2000).\nLeonelli (2016) examines many of the epistemic issues the developers\nof GO confronted in developing such a resource. Beyond its original\nfunction, GO is now widely used to interpret network graphs\nmechanistically. By annotating nodes in cellular networks with\ninformation from GO when it is available researchers interpret these\nclusters as corresponding to known mechanisms or sometimes as\nconstituting previously unknown mechanisms. Researchers make\ninferences about nodes for which such information is lacking using\nprinciples such as guilt by association—the entity is\ninferred to occur in the same location or to contribute to the same\nprocess as those with which it clusters (Bechtel 2017 analyzes several examples). \nAs a result of computational models and analyses of large networks,\ncell biology in the twenty-first century is much more focused on\norganization and appears much less reductionistic than it did in the\nmid twentieth century. For some philosophers, this reliance on network\nanalyses represents a move away from mechanistic explanations towards\na process view (Théry 2015; Nicholson 2018; Dupré 2012).\nHuneman (2010, 2018) construes the explanations resulting from network\nanalysis as a distinct type of explanation he labels topological\nexplanation. Others, however, argue that since these analyses\nstill draw upon the components constituting the system and the\nbiologists developing them continue to think of them as mechanistic,\nwe should extend the conception of mechanistic explanation to include\nthe holistic focus on organization developed in computational and\nnetwork analyses (Baetu 2015; Bechtel 2015; Levy 2014). \nWe have focused on core domains of cell biology, concerned with\nexplaining the basic activities of cells. There are, though, many\nspecialized fields concerned with cells. Some of these have become\nactive areas for philosophical inquiry in their own right. Here we\nmerely identify some of these and point readers to relevant work by\nphilosophers, including in several cases entries in the SEP. One such\ndomain is microbiology, concerned with single-cell organisms, whether\nprokaryotic (lacking a nucleus and other organelles) or eukaryotic.\nO’Malley (2014) has identified distinctive features of\nmicroorganisms (e.g., lateral gene transfer) and explores how features\nof microorganismal life challenge major assumptions about living\norganisms that have resulted from focusing predominantly on\nmulti-cellular organisms. In other work (O’Malley 2010), she has\nexamined from a philosophical perspective the competing hypotheses\nabout the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells. Much of\ncell biology has focused on mature cells of specific types and has\nattended less to the processes by which cells in multi-cellular\norganisms differentiate from a common cell, known as a stem\ncell. Fagan (2013) has pioneered the philosophical examination of\nstem-cell research, including the advent of techniques to revert\nmature cells to stem cells. Cells are not only transformed in\ndevelopmental processes in multi-cell organisms, but also in diseases\nsuch as cancer in which cells not only proliferate in uncontrolled\nways but also defeat many normally operating cellular mechanisms that\nnormally prevent proliferation. Plutynski (2018) has identified many\nof the philosophical challenges arising in the efforts to explain\ncancer (see the entry on cancer). An important\ncapability of many multicell organisms is the ability to detect\npathogens, viruses, and other threats and defend against them. Such\nimmune responses require, among other things, the capacity to\ndistinguish cells that belong to the organism itself from others (see\nthe entry on\n philosophy of immunology).\n A fundamental issue that arises in many of these contexts as well as\ntopics raised above is whether and how one should conceptualize cells\nas individuals or agents (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual). \nIn addition to approaching cells as objects of scientific study,\ncontemporary researchers often adopt an engineering approach to cells.\nOne context is in the domain of synthetic biology in which researchers\nengineer cells, sometimes for research ends but other times to\ngenerate products society finds useful (see the entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n The recent development of gene editing tools such as CRISPR opens up\nboth epistemic and ethical issues (for the ethical issues, see the\nentry on\n neuroethics).\n One context in which attempts to synthesize cells has played a\ncentral role is in the attempt to understand the origins of life. Much\nof the research on origins of life involves the development of\nprotocells—self-organized, spherical systems composed of lipids\n(Rasmussen et al. 2009). This has become a prominent topic of inquiry\nfor both theoretically minded biologists and philosophers of biology\n(see the entry on\n life;\n Bedau 2012; Moreno 2016; Dunér, Malaterre, and Geppert\n2016).","contact.mail":"bechtel@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"},{"date.published":"2019-10-15","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cell-biology/","author1":"William Bechtel","author2":"Andrew Bollhagen","entry":"cell-biology","body.text":"\n\n\nAmong biological entities, cells are regarded as of special importance\nsince they are widely viewed as the simplest organized systems that\nare unambiguously alive. Although one can debate about entities such\nas viruses, there is little debate that cells are living. Cells\nperform all the activities critical to life, from metabolism to\nreproduction. All cells alive today maintain themselves far from\nthermodynamic equilibrium with their environment and are part of a\ncontinuous lineage of cell division that goes back approximately 4\nbillion years. The study of cells has required developing means of\nmaterially manipulating them and our contemporary understanding of\ncellular phenomena integrates results from a wide range of material\ninterventions. In introducing a special issue of Studies in\nHistory and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences on\nthe cell, O’Malley and Müller-Wille assert \n\n\n\n\nThe cell, we suggest, is a nexus: a connection point between\ndisciplines, methods, technologies, concepts, structures and\nprocesses. Its importance to life, and to the life sciences and\nbeyond, is because of this remarkable position as a nexus, and because\nof the cell’s apparently inexhaustible potential to be found in\nsuch connective relationships. (2010: 169) \n\n\n\nThe examination of cell biology, in turn, is a potent nexus for\nproductive interactions between philosophers, historians, and social\nscientists, each of whom raises questions about the study of cells\nrelevant to the others.\n\n\nDuring the period when philosophy of science focused primarily on\nlaws, cell biology was largely neglected. Although it is important to\ncell biologists to discover useful generalizations, these are seldom\ncharacterized as laws. Once philosophers of science turned their\nattention from laws to mechanisms, from representational realism to\nmodels and their functionality, and from concepts and theories to\nexperiments and instrumentation, more philosophers of science have\nturned their attention to the practices of cell biology. These\npractices are epistemically challenging. Due to the fact that cells\nare mostly microscopic, they raise traditional philosophical issues\nconcerning the status of unobservables and the trustworthiness of\nevidence. Since a major concern of cell biology is to relate functions\n(e.g., biochemical reactions) to cell structures, cell biologists need\nnot just to observe but also to physically manipulate cells and their\nconstituent structures and to develop informative representations.\nTheir activities thus provide rich examples for philosophers. Although\na great deal of cell biology has yet to be tapped for philosophical\nanalysis, we provide examples in which philosophers (as well as\nhistorians) have investigated and analyzed material practices in cell\nbiology. We start, however, closer to theoretical interests, examining\nhow the discipline of cell biology developed and how metaphors have\nplayed crucial roles in shaping how scientists have conceptualized\ncells. Subsequently we turn to controversies over whether cells can be\nunderstood mechanistically or require a vitalist or holist\nperspective. After that, we turn to questions of epistemology,\nincluding strategies for representing cells visually and for\ndeveloping mechanistic accounts of cell functioning.\n\nIt is sometimes assumed that scientific disciplines are\nsharply-delineated and can be defined by their subject matter. In\nfact, however, they are dynamically changing, shaped in large part by\nscientists, their research tools, and academic and research\ninstitutions. This is clearly true in the case of cell biology.\nScientists began investigating cells in the seventeenth century after\nHooke and van Leeuwenhoek reported what they saw with newly invented\nmicroscopes. Hooke (1665) gave cells their name. But the cell did not\nbecome a focal unit for studying biological processes until Schleiden\n(1838) and Schwann (1839) advanced the cell theory according to which\ncells are the basic living units. The term cytology was\nwidely used for the studies that ensued, which focused mainly on\ndescribing cells as seen under the light microscope. Although Wilson\nused the phrase cellular biology in his introduction to\nCowdry’s General Cytology (Cowdry 1924), and many of\nits contributors aspired to integrate disciplines studying cells, the\nterm cell biology was only introduced in the years\nimmediately after World War II. Those adopting the term cell\nbiology advocated complementing new higher-resolution images\ncreated with the electron microscope with results from biochemical,\nbiophysical, and molecular approaches to cells. This transition is\nexemplified in the naming of what would become the flagship journal in\nthe field. The working title used in discussions about founding a new\njournal was Journal of Cytology. By the time of the first\nissue in 1955, it was called the Journal of Biophysical and\nBiochemical Cytology, a title chosen to emphasize the integration\nof multiple approaches to the study of cells. In 1962 it was\nre-christened The Journal of Cell Biology, by which time the\nInternational Society for Cell Biology and the American Society for\nCell Biology had also been established and the term cell\nbiology had acquired general currency for an integrated approach\nto cells. (Bechtel 2006: chapter 7, examines the establishment and\nrenaming of the journal as well as the creation of the American\nSociety for Cell Biology.) \nThe introduction of new research techniques, especially cell\nfractionation and electron microscopy, figured centrally in the\nefforts to establish cell biology as a distinct discipline in the\npost-World War II period as they enabled constructing what Palade\n(1987) termed a bridge between morphological observations and\nbiochemistry. Cell fractionation employs the ultracentrifuge to\nseparate cell contents into fractions that contain the enzymes\nresponsible for distinct cell activities while electron microscopy\nenables these fractions to be linked to organelles identifiable in\ncells. Matlin (2018) describes how Claude employed centrifugation to\nidentify microsomes which exhibited high concentrations of RNA.\nPorter’s (1953) complementary micrographs of these particles in\nfractions and tissue slices (Figure 1) linked microsomes to the\nintracellular structure he had named the endoplasmic\nreticulum. As Matlin describes, this cycling between cell\nfractionation to establish function and electron microscopy to\nlocalize it to a structure was pursued repeatedly in cell biology. \nFigure 1: Micrographs of a fraction\ncontaining microsome and of a thin-sliced preparation from a cell\nshowing the endoplasmic reticulum (marked as er). From Porter\n(1953), plate 48. \nIn terms of content, however, the break between cytology and cell\nbiology was nowhere near as sharp as the founders of cell biology\nportrayed. Cowdry’s General Cytology (1924) clearly had\nsimilar aspirations of linking studies of morphology and studies of\ncellular chemistry (see discussions by historians, philosophers, and\nbiologists of Cowdry’s project in Matlin, Maienschein, &\nLaubichler 2018). But in terms of the institutions in which scientists\nconducted their research, the break was quite significant. With the\ncreation of professional societies using the name “cell\nbiology”, biologists began to self-identify as cell biologists.\nLaboratories and academic departments adopted the name cell\nbiology and funding agencies recognized cell biology as a\nsupported field of research. \nAlthough cell biologists actively courted biochemists and to some\ndegree biophysicists to join their new discipline, these efforts\nlargely failed. The most enduring connections were with molecular\nbiology, which was established as a new discipline in the same period\n(see the entry on\n molecular biology).\n While molecular biology began with a focus on bacterial phage\n(viruses that infect bacteria) and cell biology with eukaryotic cells\nfrom mammals and plants, by the 1970s each discipline had broadened\nits focus and soon many cell biologists were adopting a molecular\napproach to cell structure and function. (A continuing point of\ndifference between cell biology and molecular biology is that cell\nbiology placed high value on linking chemical and molecular processes\nto cell structure; see Matlin 2016). Academic departments began to\ninclude both cell and molecular in their names. In\nNovember 1989 the American Society for Cell Biology created a new\njournal, Cell Regulation, but with its third volume in\nJanuary 1992, the name was changed to Molecular Biology of the\nCell. Although there are textbooks that reference just cell\nbiology in their title, several of the most prominent textbooks\nfeature both cell and molecular. These include\nAlberts’ Molecular Biology of the Cell (Alberts,\nJohnson, Lewis et al. 2015) , Cooper and Hausman’s The Cell:\nA Molecular Approach (2007), and Iwasa and Marshall’s\nKarp’s Cell and Molecular Biology (2016). The first\nedition of Alberts’ Molecular Biology of the Cell\n(Alberts, Bray, Lewis et al. 1983) was modeled in part on\nWatson’s Molecular Biology of the Gene (1976) and\nincluded Watson as a co-editor. Alberts attributes the vision of\nintegrating cell and molecular biology to Watson (see interview with\nAlberts in the Oral History Collection at Cold Springs Harbor\nLaboratory linked in\n Other Internet Resources below) \nNot only have the disciplines studying cells undergone historical\ntransformations, so has the understanding of what cells are. As Hesse\n(1966) argued, in many fields the objects of study are characterized\nthrough metaphors to more familiar objects. In examining the different\nmetaphors that have been invoked for cells, Reynolds argues that the\nchoice of metaphor has consequences for how cells are understood:  \nMetaphorical language … has been essential not only to the\nactivity of describing cells but also to seeing and\nunderstanding them, and has played no less a fundamental role\nthan the literal and material lenses of the microscope. (2018: 4)  \nReynolds distinguishes two fundamental classes of metaphors: cells\nas human artifacts and cells as organisms. Each has\ntaken on a variety of more specific forms. Among artifacts, cells have\nbeen characterized as spaces enclosed by solid walls, building blocks,\nfactories, various types of machines, and electronic computers. The\norganismal metaphors have suggested a conceptualization of cells as\nelementary organisms (like unicellular amoebae) or citizens in a state\nor society in which there is a division of labor and in which cells\nmake decisions that determine their own developmental\n‘fates’, including the ultimate decision to initiate\nprogrammed cell death (Reynolds\n 2014).[1]\n These metaphors have given rise to distinctive research agendas that\nfocus on specific aspects of cells and their relationship to other\ncells and their environment. \nWhen Hooke introduced the term cell in Micrographia\nin 1665 to describe the microscopic structure of cork that he observed\nusing a compound microscope\n (Figure 2A),\n he was comparing cells to the polygonal cells of beeswax and the\nsmall rooms occupied by monks in a monastery. (Hooke 1665: 116, also\ncommented on the fluid content of cells, labeling them\n“succus nutritus, or appropriate juices of\nvegetables”. As discussed below, the fluid content of cells took\non new importance with the advent of the protoplasm theories in the\nmid-nineteenth century.) Although researchers who focused on plants\ntended to find Hooke’s metaphor appropriate, since plant cells\nhave clearly observable walls, others, beginning with van Leeuwenhoek,\nwho examined spermatozoa\n (Figure 2B),\n animal tissues, and bacteria, tended to adopt other terms such as\ncorpuscle or globule.  \nA. Hooke’s (1665: Schem: XI, fig.\n1 facing page 115) drawing of his observations of cells in cork. \nB.Van Leeuwenhoek’s drawing of\nspermatozoa from his Letter to Nehemiah Grew, 18 March 1678.  \nFigure 2: Hooke’s drawing clearly\nshows cells as areas enclosed by walls whereas van Leeuwenhoek’s\npresents what we call cells as simple organisms. \nMost of these early investigators focused on describing what they saw\nin the microscope. But some, such as Buffon (1749), began to view\ncells as basic living units. Nicholson characterizes this as the\nbeginning of an atomist tradition in biology that identified  \na basic indivisible unit of life and [sought] to explain the\nmorphological constitution and physiological operation of all living\nbeings in terms of these fundamental units. (2010: 203)  \nThis more theoretically committed conception of cells is exemplified\nin the publications of Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839), who are\ngenerally credited with establishing the cell theory, the fundamental\ntenet of which is that cells are the basic units of living things. \nFocusing exclusively on plants, Schleiden asserted that\n“… every plant … is an aggregate of fully\nindividualized, independent, separate beings, the cells\nthemselves” (1838 [1847: 231–2]). In addition to their\nwalls, Schleiden appealed to the nucleus, which had been identified\nwith improved microscopes by Brown (1833), to identify plant\ncells. The nucleus figured centrally in Schleiden’s account of\ncell formation according to which a new cell formed through a process\nlike crystal formation—one type of material is deposited around\nthe nucleolus to form the nucleus and then other material was\ndeposited to form the cell body. The metaphor comparing cell formation\nto crystal formation played a yet larger role when Schwann confronted\nthe challenge that animal cells differ vastly in their\nappearance. Schwann argued that they were nonetheless all cells since\nthey all formed through a process analogous to crystal formation:  \nThe elementary parts of all tissues are formed of cells in an\nanalogous, though very diversified manner, so that it may be asserted\nthat there is one universal principle of development for the\nelementary parts of organisms, however different, and that this\nprinciple is the formation of cells. (Schwann 1839 [1847: 165])\n \n(For discussion of this and other uses of the crystal metaphor in\nbiology, see Haraway 1976.) \nGiven that Schwann and Schleiden were masters of microscopy (as\nwitnessed by their drawings based on their microscopic observations),\nand that other equally competent microscopists reported cells\ndividing, their claim that cells form like crystals seems anomalous.\nBechtel (1984) argues that Schwann’s strong commitment to\ndeveloping mechanistic accounts of vital processes may have played a\nmajor role in how he interpreted what he saw—the crystal\nformation metaphor provided a mechanistic model whereas at the time\nthere were no mechanical models for cell division. In any case,\nSchleiden’s and Schwann’s accounts of cell formation were\nsoon set aside as more researchers reported on cell division and\nSchwann’s concerns with mechanism were supplanted by other\nconcerns. Virchow (1855), a pathologist, offered a theoretic argument\nthat only a process like cell division could explain the transmission\nof disease and coined the oft-cited dictum “omnis cellula e\ncellula” (all cells come from cells). \nSchwann’s “theory of the cell”, however, was much\nricher than his soon rejected view of cell formation. He argued that\ncells were the basic units in which the processes of life (he coined\nthe term metabolism) occurred. He viewed metabolic processes\nas catalyzed by the specific materials that were deposited in cells as\nthey formed. Schwann (1836) had himself recently discovered pepsin, a\ncatalyst that breaks down egg albumin. (Pepsin operates, however, not\nwithin cells but after being secreted into digestive fluid.) When a\nyear later he argued that fermentation could not occur without the\ninvolvement of a whole living yeast cell (Schwann 1837), some critics\ntook Schwann to be claiming that living systems exhibited mysterious\nvital properties. But for Schwann this was consistent with his\nmechanist approach—the metabolic processes only occurred when\nthe responsible catalysts were brought together in cells. \nIn the mid- to late-nineteenth century theorizing about cells went in\na number of directions. One direction focused even more than Schwann\non the material stuff constituting the cell. In the same period as\nSchwann was advancing his theory of the cell, von Mohl (1835), a plant\nresearcher, introduced the name protoplasm for the fluid\nmaterial in cells. Animal researchers such as Dujardin (1835) called\nthe fluid seen in animal cells sarcode. Remak (1852) proposed\nthe protoplasm theory according to which the basic material of plants\nand animal was identical and T. H. Huxley (1869) took this a step\nfurther, arguing that protoplasm was the “physical basis of\nlife”. As discussed by Reynolds, protoplasm theory offered a\ndifferent fundamental biological theory—whereas Schleiden and\nSchwann  \nsought to unify all the various forms of life through a common\nmorphological type and developmental principle, the protoplasm theory\nattempted to achieve this through the identification of a common\nsubstance or material. (2018: 32)  \nAccordingly, some supporters of protoplasm sought to dislodge the cell\nas a basic living unit. The botanist Julius Sachs (1892), for example,\nasserted “to call the protoplasm unit a cell was about as\nappropriate as calling a live bee in a honeycomb a cell” (as\ntranslated by Welch & Clegg 2010: C1281). Since protoplasm appears\nas a viscous substance that is only artificially constrained by cell\nboundaries, some protoplasm theorists viewed it as supplanting the\ncell as an organizing unit. Where Schwann understood the cell to be\nthe fundamental unit of biological development, protoplasm theorists\nunderstood protoplasm to drive ontogeny and cells to be merely\nsecondary structures deposited in the course of this primary\nsubstance’s development. Recently a few biologists (Welch &\nClegg 2010, 2012) and philosophers (Nicholson, 2010) have argued for\nreviving protoplasm theory. Their argument is that protoplasm theory\npresents a more holistic systems or organismal perspective. (We\ndiscuss holism and organicism in\n Section 3.) \nThe characterization of protoplasm as just a viscous substance\nexisting on its own was complicated by the identification of the cell\nmembrane as a structure distinct from the cell wall and, as discussed\nbelow, of membrane-bound organelles. In the end, most biologists\nacquiesced in some version of Schultze’s (1861: 11; as\ntranslated by Hall, 1951: 451) compromise position that raised\nprotoplasm to be one defining feature of cells when he defined a cell\nas “a lump of protoplasm inside of which lies a\nnucleus”. Those who adopted such a compromise position often\ninvoked a metaphor, originating with Raspail, according to which the\ncell is “a kind of laboratory within which all tissues organize\nand grow” (1843: 28; as translated by Harris, 1999: 32). The\nlaboratory metaphor encouraged attempts to develop chemical\nexplanations for all the reactions occurring in cells. There were a\nnumber of variants on this theme. Unger analogized the plant cell with\na “mächtige chemische Werkstätte” (powerful\nchemical workshop) (1851: 23) and Virchow stated that “starch is\ntransformed into sugar in the plant and animal just as it is in a\nfactory” (1858: 107).  \nEmbracing this chemical perspective, several chemists sought to\nidentify the chemical catalysts needed for the reactions to occur.\nFermentation was a common focus and Kühne (1877) coined the term\nenzyme (Greek for “in yeast”) for the putative\ncatalyst operative in yeast. Enthusiasm for this effort was\ntemporarily dampened by Pasteur (1860). A noted chemist, he\nnonetheless maintained that fermentation could only be carried out in\nwhole living cells. This reflects a conception of the cell as an\nexplanatorily irreducible unit of life—a conception associated\nwith vitalism (discussed in more detail below). Enthusiasm for the\nfactory conception, though, was rekindled by Buchner (1897). Guided by\nPasteur’s contention that fermentation could not occur in the\nabsence of cells, he added sugar to an extract he prepared by\ndestroying all whole cells, thinking it would serve as a preservative.\nWhen he observed the emission of bubbles, indicating fermentation in\nthe absence of living cells, he changed course and galvanized the\npursuit of chemical investigations of metabolism that resulted in the\nestablishment of modern biochemistry in the first decades of the\ntwentieth century (Kohler 1971; Cornish-Bowden 1997). One of its early\nsuccesses was the characterization in the 1930s of a pathway of enzyme\ncatalyzed reactions responsible for fermentation (Bechtel 1986). \nAt first the factory metaphor simply identified the cell as the place\nin which chemical reactions occur, but over time researchers began to\nfocus on the different machines within the factory. The focus on\nseparate machines in the factory was promoted in the late nineteenth\nand early twentieth century when, using improved microscopes and\napplying stains to enhance contrast, investigators began to identify\nstructures within cells and theorize about their functional\nsignificance. Researchers were particularly successful in\ncharacterizing the nuclear events in cell division and fertilization.\nFlemming (1879, 1882) described in detail how the threads that he\ncalled chromatin (due to their absorption of dye), later\nnamed chromosomes, divided longitudinally, with the two\nhalves moving apart so that one of each would end up in each daughter\ncell\n (Figure 3).\n Soon after researchers such as Weismann and Correns pointed to links\nbetween chromosome transmission and heredity, but it was Boveri (1902)\nand Sutton (1903) who provided the compelling evidence that\nMendel’s factors (what would soon be called genes) are\nin or on chromosomes. Darden and Maull (1977) analyze the linking of\ngenes to chromosomes as a major example of what they termed\ninterfield theories, theories that do not try to reduce one\naccount to another but integrate the findings of different fields in a\ntheory that bridges them. \nFigure 3: Flemming’s (1882)\ndrawings of the stages of mitosis that highlights the formation of\nspindles and their role in segregating chromosomes. Images 1–3 \nare from Tafel IIIa; 4–7 from Tafel IIIb. (Figure from\n wiki commons.) \nLate in the nineteenth century cytologists also succeeded in\nidentifying membrane-enclosed structures in the cytoplasm that came to\nbe known as organelles. Altmann (1890), using new stains he\ndeveloped, observed filaments within cells that he took to be\nelementary organisms (a view he explicitly set in opposition to the\nprotoplasm theory). Although many researchers challenged\nAltmann’s observations, Benda (1899) confirmed the existence of\nfilaments using a different stain and gave them the name\nmitochondria (Greek for “thread” and\n“granule”). Because of their reactivity with oxidative\nstains, Michaelis (1899) proposed that they figured in oxidative\nreactions in cells. Yet other researchers identified other organelles\nsuch as the Golgi apparatus (Golgi 1898) and ergastoplasm (Garnier\n1897), which was ultimately identified as the endoplasmic\nreticulum. \nIn the early decades in the twentieth century biochemists and\ncytologists developed their own research techniques and pursued their\ninvestigations independently of the other. Most biochemists implicitly\nembraced the assumption that the cell was a bag of chemicals that\ncould be studied in the extracts remaining after cell structure was\ndestroyed whereas those pursuing cytological inquiries tended to\nembrace the factory metaphor in which organelles were distinct\nmachines. As witnessed by Cowdry’s (1924) General\nCytology and Bourne’s (1942) Cytology and Cell\nPhysiology, there were researchers who desired to build bridges\nbetween biochemistry and cytology. There were some techniques, albeit\nlimited, for determining the chemical composition of organelles\n(essentially, those of cytochemistry and histochemistry, which relied\non determining to which chemicals various stains bound). The nearly\nsimultaneous introduction of cell fractionation and electron\nmicroscopy in the late 1940s provided the needed research techniques\nand, as noted in\n Section 1,\n helped establish modern cell biology (Bechtel 2006; Matlin 2018). In\naddition to the linkage of microsomes to the endoplasmic reticulum,\ndescribed above, researchers linked oxidative metabolism to the inner\nmembrane of the mitochondrion. New structures were also discovered and\nconnected to functions, such as the lysosome which was linked to the\nbreakdown and recycling of disrupted cell components (de Duve\n1958). \nThe process of advancing new conceptions of cells continues. We note\njust one example here. The pioneers of cell biology in the 1940s and\n1950s embraced the machines in a factory metaphor, treating cell\norganelles as compartments in which different chemical reactions were\ncatalyzed by the enzymes housed there. Once formed, the compartments,\non this view, did not change—the crucial activities occurred\nwithin them. Over time, however, some researchers within cell biology\nbegan to identify cell structures that executed mechanical movements,\nas anticipated by Flemming’s (1882) characterization of the cell\nspindle as pulling chromosomes apart in mitosis. Of particular\nimportance was research on the cytoskeleton (consisting of actin\nfibres and microtubules). The term cytoskeleton was invoked\nin the 1930s and 1940s to denote a rigid structure, and indeed it does\nhelp give cells their shape. But it was soon found to be the locus of\nmovement. H. E. Huxley (1969) advanced an account of muscle\ncontraction as resulting from myosin molecules forming bridges that\npull on actin filaments. Both actin filaments and microtubules were\nfound to continually extend themselves at one end by incorporating new\nproteins while removing them from the other, a process characterized\nas treadmilling (Cleveland 1982). Video observations of\norganelles moving along microtubules (R. Allen et al. 1982) led to the\ndiscovery of kinesins (Vale, Reese, & Sheetz 1985), molecular\nmotors that walk along microtubules carrying cargo. It also\nfocused new attention on dyneins (Paschal & Vallee 1987),\npreviously only known for their roles in cilia and flagella, as\ncarrying cargo in the opposite direction. Recognition of this\ncontinual movement of material within cells gave rise to a new\nmetaphor of the cell as a city with bustling traffic (Vale &\nMilligan 2000). \nAlmost all of those pursuing the various metaphors discussed in the\nprevious section embraced a view that had its origins in Descartes,\nwho maintained both non-living and living systems (with the exception\nof the human mind) operated like machines. But a significant number of\nresearchers rejected this perspective and maintained that living\norganisms, including cells, are fundamentally different from ordinary\nphysical, mechanical systems. They argued that in one way or another\ncomposition from material components is insufficient to account for\nthe phenomena associated with cells. We begin with these opponents of\nmechanistic conceptions of cells and then examine how those advocating\nmechanistic approaches responded. \nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth century the opponents of mechanism\nwere typically referred to as vitalists. The various\nvitalists all rejected mechanism, taken as the view that organisms are\ncomposed of physical parts that operate in accord with the same\nprinciples as processes in the non-living world. Their positive views\nvaried. Some vitalists adopted a position much like that of substance\ndualists with respect to the mind, arguing that some non-material\ncomponent—a vital force (vis vitalis)—operates in\nliving beings and accounts for their distinctive activities. Others\navoided positing an extra component but maintained that different laws\napply in living organisms than in non-living systems (for discussions\nof these different versions of vitalism, see contributions in\nNormandin & Wolfe 2013). Regardless of how they expressed their\npositive views, vitalists commonly pointed to activities of living\norganisms that they claimed could not be accounted for in the same\nmanner as physical processes. This is well illustrated in Bichat\n(1805), who focused first on the apparent lack of determinism in the\nbehavior of biological organisms and second on the fact that organisms\nseemed to oppose physical processes that threatened to destroy them\n(in his words, they resist death). As noted above, Schwann\nand Pasteur both claimed that living yeast are needed to produce\nfermentation. While for Schwann this only entailed that fermentation\ndepended on the specific combination of materials found in cells, for\nvitalists it entailed that living cells perform activities that could\nnot be performed by the collection of component molecules. Bichat and\nPasteur, as well as other prominent vitalists such as Müller\n(1837–1840), embraced empirical and experimental research, but\ndrew limits with respect to what could be explained by appeal to the\nmaterial components of an organism alone. \nIn many cases, mechanists did not explicitly respond to vitalists but\nsimply moved forward with their research. Bernard (1865), was an\nexception. He addressed Bichat’s challenges by introducing a\ndistinction between an organism’s internal and external\nenvironment. Mechanistic operations within organisms are carried out\nin the internal environment and jointly serve to maintain that\nenvironment in a constant state. Because mechanistic operations\nrespond to conditions in the internal environment, they appear\nindeterminate when considered only in relation to external stimuli.\nMoreover, because these mechanisms work to maintain a constant\ninternal environment, one could explain the ability of organisms to\nresist physical processes that might otherwise destroy them (for\ndiscussions of Bernard see Holmes 1974 and LaFollette & Shanks\n1994). Bernard’s approach was the foundation for Cannon’s\nlater well-known work on homeostasis (1929). \nBy the beginning of the twentieth century few biologists investigating\ncells (Driesch, 1914,\nbeing a notable exception) espoused vital forces and vitalism per\nse ceased to be regarded as a tenable position. But many\nbiologists were still concerned to account for differences between\nliving cells and ordinary material systems. A prominent position\nadopted by many investigators (Haldane 1929, 1931; Lillie 1934;\nNeedham 1936; Russell 1945, 1930; Von Bertalanffy 1952; Weiss 1963;\nWoodger 1929) was holism, sometimes referred to as\norganicism. (See Nicholson and Gawne 2015, for a discussion\nof how the organicists differentiated their position from both\nvitalism and mechanism.) Holists accepted that living systems were\nbuilt out of material parts. They insisted, however, that the\nactivities performed by components of living systems depended not just\non those components and their composition but on their organization.\nAccordingly, one cannot just add together the activities of the\ncomponents to account for the whole (“the whole is not just the\nsum of its parts”). The organized whole in part determines how\nthe parts behave. This attitude is manifest, for example, in J. S.\nHaldane’s opposition to investigating the origins of life from\nnon-living matter: “There is and can be no origin of life out of\nmechanical conditions. Such an origin is inconceivable” (Haldane\n1930: 12). \nThe organization of cellular systems plays a central role in the\ndialectic between mechanistic biologists and holists. Holists often\nconstrue mechanistic biologists as downplaying the importance of\norganization, but many mechanistic biologists deny this. Bernard had\nemphasized the role of organization in allowing components to maintain\nthe constancy of the internal environment and those seeking to explain\nhomeostasis appealed to feedback loops. Recognizing that mechanistic\naccounts are not limited to a simple, additive view of organization,\nJ. S. Haldane’s son, J. B. S. Haldane, abandoned his\nfather’s commitment to holism and embraced a mechanistic\nframework that emphasized how biological components are affected by\nbeing incorporated within organized systems. In making this break with\nhis father he was heavily influenced by working with the biochemist\nHopkins (1913), who likewise made organization central to his accounts\nof biochemical processes. Accordingly, J. B. S. Haldane became one of\nthe pioneers in formulating biological inquiry into the origins of\nlife while still insisting that complex organization figured centrally\nin activities of living organisms (Martin 2010). \nPhilosophers and scientists often invoke the word emergent\nfor phenomena that are different from the phenomena generated by their\ncomponents (see the entry on\n emergent properties).\n Sometimes emergent phenomena are viewed as incapable of being\nexplained in terms of their constituents. In the context of\ncharacterizing systems biological accounts of cell phenomena, Boogerd\net al. (2005) develop an account according to which emergent phenomena\nare ones that are fully explicable in terms of how their constituents\nbehave in the organized system, but not in terms of how they behave in\nsimpler (less complexly organized) systems. This recognizes that many\ncellular constituents behave differently when incorporated into\nparticular systems in which they receive distinctive inputs. For other\nrecent treatments of emergence and its applications to cell biology,\nsee (Hooker 2011a; S.\nMitchell 2012; Mossio, Bich, & Moreno 2013; Winning & Bechtel\n2019). \nThe desire to understand how the organization in cells and\nmulticellular organisms differs from that found in most naturally\noccurring systems or human-made artifacts motivated a body of research\nin theoretical biology in the 1970s and 1980s. Among the most\nprominent contributors to theoretical biology were Pattee (many of his\nmost important papers have been collected in Pattee 2012), Rosen\n(1985, 1991), Polanyi (1968), and Waddington (1961). Philosophy of\nbiology, as it developed as a specialty in philosophy of science in\nthe 1970s and 1980s, largely ignored this tradition. Today however a\nnumber of philosophers concerned with cell biology are drawing upon\nits insights. Here we focus on one key conceptual tool theoretical\nbiologists provide for understanding the distinctive activities of\nliving systems such as cells: constraints. The notion of constraint is\ndrawn from classical mechanics, where constraints serve to constitute\nmacro-scale objects from their micro-scale particles. Constraints thus\naccount for why macro-scale objects exhibit different properties than\ntheir constituents. Constraints are not explained by laws but rather\nserve as boundary conditions that must be ascertained empirically.\nAccordingly, to the degree constraints explain biological activities\nof cells, these activities cannot be reduced, in the sense of being\nderived from the principles of chemistry or physics. Instead,\nresearchers must, on the basis of empirical inquiry, identify the\nconstraints actually realized in living cells. \nThe importance of constraints for understanding cellular and other\nbiological phenomena has been developed recently by Hooker (2011b, 2013) and Moreno and Mossio\n(2015). Hooker makes clear that, although the term constraint\nsuggests limitations, constraints also extend possibilities—to\noffer a cellular example, microtubules that run from the cell center\nto the periphery restrict the movement of the kinesin and dynein\nmotors that move on them but also provide a possibility for transport\nof organelles to distant locations. Moreno and Mossio in particular\ndevelop a perspective that links the focus on constraints to the idea\nthat living cells are autopoietic. Drawing upon Maturana and\nVarela’s (1980) conception of living systems as autopoietic\nmachines—machines that provide a network of production that\nenables the construction of the living system—Moreno and Mossio\nadd a focus on the thermodynamic requirements of cells. Cells, as\nhighly organized systems, are far from equilibrium and require a\ncontinual source of free energy to carry out the operations required\nto synthesize new components and resist the tendency towards\nequilibrium. What constraints do in organisms, on their account, is\ndirect flows of free energy to perform the work of building,\nrepairing, and reproducing the organism. \nSome constraints are flexible, and these make possible an important\nfeature of living systems—the ability of organisms to control\nproduction mechanisms (such as those involve in fermentation or muscle\ncontraction) through the actions of \ncontrol mechanisms. On Pattee’s account, control mechanisms\nchange the flexible constraints in production mechanisms in\nlight of information that is procured by making measurements. Negative\nfeedback control mechanisms, such as thermostats, are simple examples:\nthe thermostat makes a measurement of a variable (temperature in the\nroom) that is affected by the operation of the production\nmechanisms—the furnace—and based on the measurement\nexecutes action on the constraints in the furnace mechanism. Examples\nof feedback control mechanisms are widespread in cells. Some of the\nbest-known examples are the lac operon (Jacob & Monod\n1961) and feedback control of glycolysis by ATP (Ghosh & Chance\n1964). The measurements used by control systems need not be restricted\nto states affected by the activity of the production mechanism; they\ncan also measure states in the organism or states in its environment.\nUsing such measurements, production mechanisms can be controlled so as\nto operate only in particular circumstances, enabling the organism,\nfor example, to navigate to a food source or avoid a predator as\nneeded. \nMoreno and Mossio (2015) offer an account in which appropriately\norganized productive and control mechanisms enable cells, and by\nextension multi-cellular organisms, to achieve what they refer to as\nbiological autonomy:  \na distinctive regime of causation, able not only of producing and\nmaintaining the parts that contribute to the functioning of the system\nas an integrated, operational, and topologically distinct whole but\nalso able to promote the conditions of its own existence through its\ninteraction with the environment. (2015: xvi–xvii)  \nNote that mechanisms, on this view, are contained within cells and\nthat it is cells, not mechanisms that are autonomous. What becomes\ncrucial for understanding the autonomy of cells is the organization of\ncontrol mechanisms that orchestrate the activities of various\nproductive mechanisms so as to maintain the cell (or the multicellular\norganism). One notable feature of this focus on the organization\nneeded to maintain autonomy is that it is compatible with the more\ntraditional philosophical accounts of mechanism (discussed in\n section 5)\n but emphasizes a feature not prominent in them—that production\nmechanisms are subject to control mechanisms. To understand the\nbehavior of cellular mechanisms, researchers must not only look inside\nmechanisms to their organized parts and operations but outside to how\nthey are situated in cells and organisms in such a way that they can\nbe controlled by other mechanisms (Winning & Bechtel 2018; Bechtel\nin press). Such an ontological framework for understanding cells (as\nwell as multicellular organisms) integrates insights from traditional\nmechanists in biology and their vitalist/organicist/holist critics,\ncapturing what is distinctive of living organisms within a framework\nthat accepts them as consisting of mechanisms, but mechanisms\norganized in appropriate ways. \nWe turn now from questions about the ontological status of cells to\nepistemic questions about how scientists study them. We begin with how\nscientists represent cells and information about them. Traditionally,\nphilosophy of science has focused on linguistic representations of\nscientific knowledge. But in many fields of biology and especially in\ncell biology, information is often presented in images.\nScientists’ very familiarity with cells results from visual\nrepresentations generated using microscopes. Developing microscopes\nand techniques for using them to produce interpretable images\npresented a number of challenges. We begin in section 4.1 with the\nchallenges in generating images (micrographs) at all and in section\n4.2 consider challenges in evaluating the reliability of the resulting\nimages. Beyond these replete (highly detailed) representations, cell\nbiologists rely on a variety of less replete diagrams. (The\ncharacterization of images as “replete” is due to Perini,\n2013. Drawing on Goodman, she uses relative repleteness to\ndifferentiate diagrams from pictures.) In particular, as discussed in\n section 4.3,\n when they are developing mechanistic hypotheses about cells, cell\nbiologists rely on cell diagrams that represent types of cell\ncomponents and mechanism diagrams that represent select components\nwithin cells that are hypothesized to constitute parts of the\nmechanism responsible for a given phenomenon (Downes 1992). \nAs discussed above, in the seventeenth century both Hooke and van\nLeeuwenhoek pioneered the use of light microscopes to observe cells.\nSubsequent investigators often designed their own microscopes. The\nvariations in these designs contributed to variability in the\nresulting images. (Before photography, microscopists drew what they\nsaw using the microscope, introducing another source of variation.)\nThe variability of the images different researchers produced was one\nfactor that led biologists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nto examine more carefully the processes through which microscopes\ngenerate images (Schickore 2001, 2007). In his theoretical studies of\nlenses, Newton (1704) characterized two types of aberrations created\nby lenses: spherical aberrations, resulting from light rays coming\ninto focus at different points, and chromatic aberrations, resulting\nfrom light of different wavelengths being refracted at different\nangles. Schickore (2007) describes the many efforts by microscope\ndevelopers to correct for these aberrations and the creation of test\nobjects for evaluating the reliability of particular microscopes.\nDuring the same time enthusiasts were advancing many claims about what\nthey saw, some of which were shown later to be artifacts. For example,\nboth Milne-Edwards (1823) and Dutrochet (1824) reported round\nstructures of a constant size similar to that reported for cells,\nwhich they termed globules. (See Schickore 2009 for a\ndetailed examination of the reports of globules and an argument that\nit was the variability in these reports that contributed to the\ngrowing sense that something was amiss in the practices of the\nmicroscopists.) Globules were, however, soon shown to be the products\nof spherical aberrations. In the early nineteenth century several lens\nmakers developed strategies for eliminating spherical aberrations and\ngreatly limiting chromatic aberration (chromatic aberrations were not\nfully eliminated until the introduction of the apochromatic lenses in\nmid-century). As a result, the observations by Schleiden, Schwann, and\nothers discussed above were largely free of these distortions. \nLight microscopes faced another limit, that on magnification (a\nlimitation imposed by the wave length of light). For cell researchers\nto obtain higher-resolution images that could reveal constituents of\ncells, a microscope relying on different physical principles was\nrequired. The most important alternative to the light microscope for\nstudying cells was the (transmission) electron microscope, which\nemploys beams of electrons to create images in a manner comparable to\nphotography: locations on the photographic plate hit by many electrons\nare black in the negative and white in the positive image. When\nstructures in the cell scatter electrons, the location in the negative\nremains white and appears dark in the positive image. Although\nelectron microscopes were available in the early 1930s, only in the\nyears just before and during World War II did biologists begin to\nexplore their potential. One difficulty they confronted is that most\neukaryotic cells are too thick to be penetrated by the 50kV electron\nbeam available in the first electron microscopes. Microtomes had been\ndeveloped for cutting slices of cells for light microscopy, but new\napproaches to microtome design were required to slice cells\nsufficiently thinly without creating distortions. This problem was not\nsolved until the early 1950s (Porter & Blum 1953). Accordingly,\nsome of the first electron micrograph studies focused on fibrous\nmaterial such as collagen (Schmitt, Hall, & Jakus 1942) or on\nbacteria (Stanley & Anderson 1941). Porter, Claude, and Fullam\n(1945) created the first electron micrograph of a eukaryotic cell by\nculturing it under conditions where the periphery spread very thinly,\nallowing electrons to penetrate. They generated an image\n (Figure 4)\n that showed at the periphery  \nfilamentous mitochondria of various lengths and fairly constant width;\nscattered, small elements of high density especially abundant around\nthe nucleus and presumably representing Golgi bodies; and a delicate\nlace-work extending throughout the cytoplasm. (1945: 246) \nFigure 4: Comparison of images of\nfibroblast from a tissue cultured chick embryo as seen with electron\nmicroscope (left) and light microscope (right). From Porter, Claude,\nand Fullam (1945: plate 10). \nBesides the challenge of creating preparations sufficiently thin to be\npenetrated by the electron beam, researchers confronted a number of\nother challenges in preparing biological material for electron\nmicroscopy. For example, specimens must be placed in vacuum, and this\nrequires first removing all water, the primary constituent of cells,\nwithout inducing to many distortions. Several historians and\nphilosophers (Rheinberger 1995, Rasmussen 1997, and Bechtel 2006) have\nexamined how biologists confronted these challenges and evaluated the\nreliability of the resulting micrographs. How they addressed one\nchallenge—that of creating sufficient contrast in the\nimages—greatly affected the images that were produced. This was\nalready a challenge with light microscopy: cell material is mostly\ntranslucent so that the light transmitted is mostly of the same\nwavelength, making it hard to differentiate the various structures in\nthe image. To address the challenge, light microscopists in the\nmid-nineteenth century began experimenting with dyes used for fabrics.\nAs noted in\n Section 2,\n Flemming named the nuclear structures he observed chromatin since\nthey bound the aniline dye he was using. The problem for electron\nmicroscopy was similar—cell components differ little in their\nability to block electron transmission. Electron microscopists found\nthat several of the fixatives used in light microscopy, especially\nthose involving heavy metals, enhanced the ability to block electrons,\nand accordingly the contrast in the resulting images. Given that there\nwas little knowledge about what given chemicals would bind to within\nthe cell, the investigation of these stains was mostly pursued by\nresearchers trying out different compounds and procedures for applying\nthem (exemplified in Palade’s 1952, study of osmium tetroxide)\nto see what images they could generate. Indeed, different stains\n(osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, etc.) did yield different\nimages. \nSince there was little understanding about what stains bound to,\nskeptics often raised doubts that they were revealing actual\nstructures in cells. Bechtel (2000, 2006) highlights three\nconsiderations that often figured in scientists’ evaluation of\nwhether micrographs were informative about cells or only artifacts of\nthe methods of preparation: (1) the quality of the micrographs\nthemselves—do they exhibit distinct patterns? (2) the robustness\nof the results—can comparable results be generated with\ndifferent techniques (e.g., with light and electron microscopy or with\nmultiple stains)? and (3) the theoretical plausibility of the\nresults—do they fit into a coherent theoretical account? While\nthe first is seldom commented on in philosophical accounts, it is\nnotable that scientists are inclined to assume that if an image\nreveals a distinct, replicable pattern, it reflects something in the\nsource (although this assessment may be retracted if, for example, a\nresearcher shows how the pattern could be generated by other means).\nThere has been extensive philosophical discussion of the\nsecond—the inference that when the same result is generated by\nindependent means, it reflects a preexisting entity in the world\n(Hacking 1983; Culp 1995; Stegenga & Menon 2017). However, this\ncriterion proves insufficient at just the point at which results with\nnew techniques, such as the electron microscope, are most\ncontroversial—when the images contain structures beyond those\nthat can be detected with other existing techniques. In these cases,\nthe distinctness of the patterns together with considerations as to\nthe theoretical plausibility of the findings are the criteria\nresearchers can use. Appeal to theoretical plausibility, however,\nwould seem to be circular since in traditional philosophical accounts,\ntheories are tested by the evidence generated by the technique. But\ndeveloping a plausible theory that fits with an experimental finding\nand other evidence is not easy and when they are able to do so,\nscientists view it as buttressing their judgments that the images\nreflect real structures. To illustrate how these considerations have\nbeen invoked in in cell biology, we present two examples philosophers\nhave examined of conflicts over whether the structure shown in\nmicroscopic images was real or an artifact. The cases ended\ndifferently, one with the acceptance of the structure, one with its\nrejection. \nThe first case involves the Golgi apparatus, first described by Golgi\n(1898) in light microscope studies using the silver nitrate stain he\nhad introduced. Palade and Claude (1949a,b), two of the pioneers of\nmodern cell biology, who would ultimately share the Nobel Prize,\nargued that it was an artifact of staining, including with osmium\ntetroxide (which Palade helped establish as a primary stain for\nelectron microscopy). They appealed not only to the variable\nappearance of the Golgi bodies, as had some earlier skeptics\n(Strangeways & Canti 1927; Parat 1928; Baker 1944), but also to\ntheir own ability to create myelin figures similar in appearance to\nthe Golgi bodies by adding osmium to egg white. As discussed by\nBechtel (2006), this is compelling evidence for the claim that the\nGolgi apparatus is an artifact, but in this case the evidence was\neventually set aside without being refuted. Although Palade remained a\nskeptic about the Golgi apparatus for 15 years (researchers in his lab\nreported that they were not allowed to mention it during that\ninterval), he finally accepted its reality when researchers in his\nlaboratory demonstrated that many newly synthesized proteins pass\nthrough the region of the cell where the Golgi apparatus appeared on\ntheir way to being secreted. He did not, however, explain why he\nchanged his mind. This later research on the Golgi apparatus, but not\nhis earlier skepticism about the existence of the Golgi apparatus, was\nnoted in Palade’s Nobel Prize citation in 1974. Palade himself\nlater contributed to two reviews (Farquhar & Palade 1981, 1998)\nthat discuss earlier researchers who cast doubts on the reality of the\nGolgi apparatus, but he never mentions his own claims that it was an\nartifact. What seems particularly salient is that, as a result of\nresearch in his laboratory, the Golgi apparatus was associated with a\nfunction in the cell in a manner that it had not been previously. It\nnow fit into a plausible theory in which it figured in packaging\nproteins for export from the cell. Bechtel argues that this is often a\nmajor factor in researchers’ acceptance of the reality of\nentities identified through new techniques. \nThe second example stems from early electron microscopy of bacterial\ncells. Chapman and Hillier (1953) observed invaginations of the plasma\nmembrane in gram-negative bacteria, which they called peripheral\nbodies. Robertson (1958) renamed them mesosomes and they\nwere implicated by many researchers in a variety of cell functions\nbefore being rejected as artifacts in the 1970s (Silva et al. 1976).\nAnalyzing this example, Rasmussen (1993) argues that philosophical\ncriteria for distinguishing real entities from artifacts, such as\nrobustness, are insufficient to explain scientists’ changing\njudgments about the mesosome. When Chapman and Hillier first made\ntheir case for the existence of mesosomes, they had to explain away\ndifferences between their micrographs and the observations of light\nmicroscopists by arguing that a membrane that only appeared in images\nwith the light microscope was in fact due to the mesosomes being\nimaged under low resolution. Rasmussen contends they offered this\nconvoluted argument rather than treating the mesosomes as an artifact\nbecause they were promoting the new electron microscopes. He further\ndescribes how their claims motivated research programs aimed at\npurifying and biochemically characterizing the mesosome so as to\nevaluate proposals regarding their function. This initially supported\nclaims to the mesosome’s reality, but other biochemists offered\nconflicting evidence. In addition, another new technique for preparing\nspecimens for electron microscopy by freezing them, which had its own\npassionate advocates, generated micrographs that did not show\nmesosomes. According to Rasmussen, these competing findings, not\nrobustness, determined scientists’ judgments about\nmesosomes. \nThe case of the mesosome has attracted substantial interest from other\nphilosophers of science. Culp (1994) challenged Rasmussen’s\ninterpretation of the history of mesosomes, contending that the\nrejection of mesosomes as an artifact is in fact best explained on\ngrounds of robustness. In particular, she points to the combined data\nfrom biochemists that revealed few differences between cytoplasmic\nmembranes and specimens supposedly from mesosomes and from a new\ngeneration of electron microscopists that suggested that mesosomes\nresulted from the fixative, glutaraldehyde, used to generate the\nmicrographs purporting to show them. These robustness considerations,\nshe claims, sufficed to lead the community to reject mesosomes. In a\nlater paper, Rasmussen responds to Culp’s analysis, continuing\nto maintain that local details, not principles like robustness,\ndetermine scientists’ judgments about artifacts:  \ngeneral principles like robustness are too vague to warrant anything\nwhatsoever, because when described in sufficient detail it emerges\nthat the way such principles are instantiated is in flux—and the\ndevil is in the details. (2001: 643)  \nSeveral other philosophers have also taken up the case of the\nmesosome. Allchin (2000) characterizes the initial evidence for the\nmesosome as robust and describes how subsequent research showing how\nparticles were generated by degeneration of the membrane in\npreparation for electron microscopy led to a reassessment, culminating\nin mesosomes being recognized as artifacts. Weber (2005) argues that\nthe process of evaluating claims about artifacts employs causal\nreasoning of the same sort as used in testing theoretical hypotheses.\nAccording to him, mesosomes were judged to be artifacts when evidence\nsupported the claim that they were produced by chemical fixation.\nHudson (2014: chapter 2) advances yet another alternative: according\nto which what mattered most to researchers was whether they regarded\nthe process for generating evidence for or against mesosomes as a\nreliable process. \nMicroscopic images, whether hand-drawn, as they were in the nineteenth\ncentury, or captured in photographs, are highly detailed. However, the\nknowledge cytologists and cell biologists seek to develop is more\nabstract and general—they seek to identify the types of\nstructures found in cells, not all their instances. Accordingly, cell\nbiologists frequently generate diagrams that leave out details.\nMaienschein (1991) examines the origin of this practice in\nWilson’s (1896) classic text, The Cell in Development and\nInheritance. Early in the book Wilson provided a diagram\n (Figure 5A)\n which abstracts from the much more replete photographs he had\npresented just a year earlier (Wilson 1895). Instead of showing all\nthe instances of different organelles, he presents just a few\ninstances of each type. Organelles are shown using icons that are\nsuggestive of their shapes. Such diagrams serve to convey the types of\norganelles found in cells and their typical location, but falsely\nsuggest that most of the space in the cell is empty. Maienschein\ncontends that this transition from photographs to abstract diagrams\nreflects Wilson’s growing confidence in the correctness of his\ninterpretation of what he was seeing through the microscope and a\ntransition “from presenting data to representing\ntheory” (Maienschein 1991: 252). A\nsign of their theoretical status is that such figures, unlike\nmicrographs or data plots, often undergo numerous revisions as\nscientists develop their account. Revising these diagrams is a means,\nin fact, of developing theory. With the development of biochemical and\nmolecular accounts of cell phenomena, researchers often make what\nSerpente (2011) characterizes as a transition from the iconic to the\nsymbolic. He presents protein-protein interaction maps and gene\nregulatory diagrams as examples of symbolic representations. \nA. Wilson’s (1896: 14, figure 5)\ncell diagram that leaves out much of the detail that would be seen\nthrough the microscope to focus on  \nB. A mechanism diagram of the processes\nof heterophagy and autophagy from de Duve and Wattiaux (1966: 468,\nfigure 6). \nFigure 5  \nSimilar points also apply to another type of diagram that appears\nfrequently in cell biology—diagrams of hypothesized mechanisms\nthat are taken to be responsible for a particular phenomenon (Sheredos\net al. 2013; Abrahamsen, Sheredos, & Bechtel 2018). Such diagrams\ndo not try to show all the organelle types but, as in\n Figure 5B,\n only those thought to be involved in generating a particular\nphenomenon—in this case, the breakdown of materials taken into\nthe cell (heterophagy) or of cell components themselves (autophagy).\nOne challenge with mechanism diagrams is that they are static whereas\nmechanisms are engaged in change (the digestion of organelles and the\nexpulsion of the remaining material). One common strategy is to use\narrows to represent activities, although often within the same diagram\narrows may have multiple different meanings. Ultimately, however, it\nis up to the viewer to animate a mechanism diagram (Hegarty\n1992)—to rehearse mentally the different activities that are\nrepresented and to imagine the changes that are being produced by\ndifferent parts. \nOne might think that diagrams are only important as a means of\nillustrating results that are presented textually. But examination of\nthe practices of scientists reveals that they are far more central to\ntheir reasoning. Early in the development of a mechanistic hypothesis\nscientists sketch their ideas. Often mechanism diagrams (as well as\nthe other figures that show data or the workflow of the research) are\ncrafted long before text is drafted. Diagrams are commonly presented\nin lab meetings and revised multiple times as scientists are refining\ntheir claims. Researchers often generate the text of the paper only at\nthe end of this process. Taking advantage of access to the draft\nfigures and text for two research projects, Sheredos and Bechtel\n(2017, in press) examined the process of interactive engagement in\nwhich the investigators modified diagrams, changed text, and then\nfurther modified the diagram. What this process suggests is that\nsketching and resketching mechanisms plays a central role as\nresearchers seek to identify what they can conclude from their\nexperimental studies. In one of the cases they examined, an early\nversion of a diagram serves to pose a question that was addressed\nthrough the experimental studies, resulting in a final diagram that\noffers an answer to the question posed. Beyond supporting the\nempirical claims of a research project, Jones and Wolkenhauer (2012)\nprovide an illuminating discussion of how diagrams serve to locate\ninformation required for a computational model in a representation of\nthe cellular mechanism that is being modeled, \nHistorically prominent philosophers of science such as Popper and\nReichenbach rejected inquiries into how scientific theories are\ndiscovered as not philosophical (see the entry on\n scientific discovery).\n Beginning with Hanson (1958), though, discovery has attracted the\ninterest of many philosophers of science. Investigations into\ndiscovery in cell biology (and related fields such as biochemistry,\nmolecular biology, and neuroscience) inspired Bechtel and Richardson\n(1993 [2010]) to argue that the goal in these fields was not to\nconstruct nomological explanation (Hempel 1965) but rather to identify\nthe mechanism responsible for a phenomenon and determine how it\nworked. Examples from cell biology have also figured prominently in\naccounts of mechanistic explanation by Machamer, Darden, and Craver\n(2000), Craver and Darden (2013), Bechtel (2006), and others (see\nGlennan & Illari, 2018, for a compendium of contemporary accounts\nof mechanisms and mechanistic explanation, and the entry\n mechanisms in science).\n The concept mechanism figures both in discussion of\nontological issues and epistemic issues, but the two uses can be\ndistinguished in the manner proposed by G. Allen (2005). In this\nsection we are concerned with what he called “operative or\nexplanatory mechanism” (2005: 261; the thesis that for\nexplanatory purposes components of cells should be conceived to\nfunction as if they were machines);\n Section 3\n concerned “philosophical mechanism” (2005: 261; the\nontological thesis that organisms are or are constituted by\nmachines). \nOne of the central objectives of many philosophers of science focused\non mechanistic explanations is to characterize reasoning strategies or\nheuristics that scientists use to develop mechanistic explanations\n(Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010]; Craver & Darden 2013; Gross\n2018). We discuss reasoning strategies that figure in different phases\nof developing mechanistic explanations in cell biology: delineating\nphenomena and situating them in responsible mechanisms, identifying\nand characterizing the components of mechanisms (a reductionistic\nphase), and determining the organization within mechanisms and between\nmechanisms and their contexts (a more holistic phase). \nChallenging the common characterization of explanations as explaining\ndata, Bogen and Woodward advanced the claim that scientific\nexplanations are targeted at phenomena. Instead of defining what\nphenomena are, they give examples: “weak neutral currents, the\ndecay of the proton, and chunking and recency effects in human\nmemory” (1988: 306). From these examples, it is clear that Bogen\nand Woodward understand phenomena to be repeatable processes that can\nbe observationally or experimentally detected in multiple ways. On\nthis characterization, cell activities such as protein synthesis or\ncell division count as cellular phenomena. Although phenomena are\noften construed as the starting point of research, Craver and Darden\n(2013: Chapter 4) identify some of the experimental tasks involved in\ncharacterizing phenomena such as identifying precipitating conditions,\nmanifestations, inhibiting conditions, modulating conditions, and\nnonstandard conditions that alter the manifestation of the phenomenon.\nThey also emphasize the role of multiple experimental techniques in\nspecifying features of phenomena. A good deal of research in cell\nbiology is devoted to determining conditions under which cell\nphenomena such as programmed cell death are initiated or inhibited and\ncell biologists have been inventive in developing experimental\ntechniques needed to produce these phenomena. Bechtel (forthcoming)\npoints out that phenomena that are the target of explanation range\nfrom highly specific (protein synthesis in liver cells under low\noxygen conditions) to much more general (protein synthesis\ngenerically). Individual research projects often address highly\nspecific phenomena whereas textbooks or review articles discuss more\ngeneral phenomena. \nWhile some account of the phenomenon under study is generally adopted\nbefore researchers set out to identify the responsible mechanism, the\ncharacterization often changes radically as research on the\nresponsible mechanism proceeds (Bechtel & Richardson 1993 [2010],\nrefer to researchers reconstituting the phenomenon). This is\nillustrated with an example from the study of cells. A starting point\nfor early inquiries into how animals store energy for their activities\nfocused on the heat generated by metabolizing foodstuffs. This heat\nwas assumed to power other activities and approximately a hundred\nyears of research was devoted to explaining animal heat (see\nMendelsohn 1964). However, after Lohmann (1929) and Fiske and Subbarow\n(1929) had identified adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and demonstrated\nthat when hydrolyzed it would release considerable energy, heat was\ndetermined to be just a waste product of metabolism and researchers\ninstead focused on the synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP. This became\nthe reconstituted phenomenon to which much of the older research was\nnow applied. \nWhat is distinctive of mechanistic explanations is that they decompose\nmechanisms into parts or entities and the operations or activities\nthat contribute to realizing the phenomenon. Although sometimes\nresearchers can proceed by reasoning a priori about what\ncomponent activities would be required to produce a given phenomenon,\nmost often the decomposition is developed on the basis of experiments.\nWhile the goal is to identify both parts and operations and to link\nthem, a given group of researchers may only have research techniques\nthat allow them to identify one or the other. This was the case in\ncell biology. As discussed in\n Section 1,\n microscopic research enabled researchers to identify component parts\n(organelles) of cells, but except for indirect clues such as shape or\nthe ability of an organelle to take up a stain, these researchers were\nunable to procure information about the functions they performed.\nBiochemists on the other hand were able to identify reactions involved\nin many cell activities, but since they studied these in chemical\nsoups made by grinding up the cell, they were not able to link these\nto cell structures. Cell biology developed with the introduction of\nnew techniques such as cell fractionation and electron microscopy that\nopened up the possibility of localizing biochemical reactions in\norganelles. \nIt is worth emphasizing that the sense in which decomposition is\nreductionistic is very different from that involved in more\ntraditional philosophical accounts of theory reduction, which involves\nthe derivation of one theory from another (Nagel 1961; see the entries\non\n scientific reduction\n and\n reductionism in biology).\n Researchers pursue decomposition without assuming the existence of\nfull theories at either level or that a theory at one level can be\nderived from one at a lower level. Moreover, in pursuing decomposition\nresearchers typically do not assume that knowledge of the lower-level\ncomponents is sufficient for explaining the phenomena—at a\nminimum, they recognize that how the components are organized is also\nimportant. The association of a cell process with a specific enzyme is\nnot the end of the explanatory process—the activity of enzymes\nis often affected by the context in which the enzyme exists, for\nexample, in a membrane. For this reason, researchers value in\nvitro reconstitution experiments in establishing that they have\ncorrectly accounted for a phenomenon. \nAllchin (1996, 2007) and Weber (2002), analyze an important\nreconstitution experiment at the interface of cell biology and\nbiochemistry that played a major role in resolving a conflict between\ntwo opposing accounts of the synthesis of ATP in oxidative metabolism.\nBiochemists spent a couple decades trying to identify a purely\nchemical pathway that used the energy released in oxidative metabolism\nto synthesize ATP (as happens in glycolysis). P. Mitchell (1961)\nadvanced an alternative, chemiosmotic hypothesis according to which\nenergy was transferred via the creation of a proton gradient over a\nmembrane. Kagawa and Racker (1966) had already linked ATP synthase to\nsmall knobs on the inner mitochondrial membrane but it was an\nin vitro chimeric system combining fragments from bacteria,\nplants, and animals created by Racker and Stoeckenius (1974) that\ndemonstrated that energy could first be captured in a proton gradient\nand then used in mitochondria to synthesize ATP. Unlike purely\nbiochemical accounts that discounted cell structure, this research\nshowed the importance of not just enzymes but how they are situated\nwith respect to cell structures in explaining cellular phenomena.  \nEven in chemical soups individual molecules are arranged in a\nparticular pattern. This pattern affects, for example, which molecule\nencounters another. When analyzing such soups, however, chemists do\nnot try to decipher the arrangement but instead rely on statistical\nmeasures about the likelihood of encounters. But cells are\ndifferent—different molecules are segregated in different\nlocations and how they are organized affects the resulting behavior\n(this is true even in prokaryotic cells that lack internal membranes,\nwith molecules segregated in different parts of the cell, sometimes\nchanging location over the course of a day; see Cohen, Erb,\nSelimkhanov, et al., 2014). Organization is also important in\nmanufactured products. If the parts of your computer were distributed\non your desk, and each part was provided with some input so that it\nwas performing an operation, the parts would still not carry out the\nsame activities as they do when they are in their proper arrangement.\nOrganization ensures that the outputs of one component are passed to\nthe appropriate others as inputs. The importance of organization is\nfurther recognized when one considers that what human designers do is\nimpose new organization on existing components to achieve novel\ndesired effects. Evolution often does the same in biology. \nOrganization is especially important for attempts to understand the\nactivities of cells but, until recently, cell biologists have had\nlimited tools for determining organization. At a coarse-grained level,\nthe combination of cell fractionation and electron microscopy provided\ninformation about organization and this provided insight into how\ncells perform their activities. For example, recognizing that enzymes\nthat can break apart cell components are segregated from the rest of\nthe cell within the lysosome explains why they only carry out their\nactivities on structures that are first transported into the lysosome.\nAnd knowing that a collection of enzymes is localized in an adjacent\nmembrane explains how products of one reaction are readily taken up in\nanother. In these cases the organization realized in cells and its\nconsequences can be characterized qualitatively and presented in a\nmechanism diagram, as discussed in\n section 4.3.\n In other cases, however, the organization is more complex than can be\ndescribed in such qualitative terms. Especially when components are\norganized into feedback loops, and the individual operations are\ncharacterized in nonlinear functions, cell biologists turn to\ncomputational models to understand their behavior. Bechtel and\nAbrahamsen (2010) and Brigandt (2013) describe a number of examples\nfrom recent research on cell phenomena that require computational\nmodels and refer to the resulting explanations that apply dynamical\nanalysis to mechanistic accounts as “dynamical mechanistic\nexplanations”. Using computational modeling of spindle formation\nin cell division as an example, Gross (2018) shows how computational\nmodels can go beyond what has been established experimentally and\nserve as heuristics guiding further research. \nIn recent years cell biologists have acquired new tools for studying\norganization, many of these advanced in systems biology (Green 2017;\nsee the entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n One approach in systems biology seeks to develop comprehensive\ndetailed models of the numerous components identified as involved in\nspecific phenomena (Gross & Green 2017). High-throughput data\nabout, for example, which proteins in a cell can bind to each other or\nwhich pairs of genes, when mutated together, are lethal, has massively\nincreased the number of cell components associated with any given\nphenomenon. To make sense of this cell researchers often seek abstract\nmodels by constructing networks in which nodes stand for entities and\nedges for interactions between entities (Green et al. 2018). The\nchallenge researchers face is to make sense of these\nnetworks—given the large number of entities involved and their\nmany interactions, these networks can often appear as hairballs. We\nbriefly consider two strategies for analyzing networks in cell biology\nthat philosophers have analyzed. \nAlon and his collaborators, focusing on gene transcription networks and metabolic\nnetworks in bacteria and yeast, identified “recurring,\nsignificant patterns of interconnections” involving two, three, or four\nnodes, which they called motifs (Milo et al., 2002: 824). One example, occurring in\n“hundreds of non-homologous gene systems” (Mangan,\nZaslaver, & Alon 2003: 197) in the transcription network of E.\ncoli, is the feedforward loop. In a feedforward loop\n (Figure 6),\n one unit sends inputs to two other units, the first of which also\nsends an input to the other, which serves as the final output unit.\nUsing Boolean models, Alon and his colleagues demonstrated that\ndepending on whether the connections are excitatory or inhibitory,\nsuch a motif can perform a number of different functions. For example,\nif all the connections are excitatory and the final output unit is\nonly active when it receives input from both of the other units (the\nconnections to it constitute an AND-gate, as shown on the left in\n Figure 6),\n then the feedforward loop functions as a persistence\ndetector—the output unit only becomes active when the input to\nthe first unit endures at least until the second unit becomes active.\nThis, as Mangan et al. explain, protects the output (which might serve\nto start the transcription of a gene) from being generated in response\nto random noise presented to the input unit. The feedforward loop and\nAlon’s other motifs are characterized abstractly without\nspecific reference to what entities and interactions correspond to the\nnodes and edges. Philosophers who have examined this research refer to\nthese organizational patterns as design principles (Green\n2015; Green, Levy, & Bechtel 2015; Levy & Bechtel 2013). \nFigure 6: Three examples of feedforward\nloops studied by Alon and his colleagues \nThe second strategy employs computational tools such as cluster\nanalysis to find collections of nodes that are especially highly\ninterconnected. To interpret these clusters in terms of mechanisms\noperative in the cell, researchers often align them with Gene Ontology\n(GO), a resource that was developed to represent published information\nabout cell components, molecular functions, and biological processes\nin directed acyclic graphs so as to facilitate communication between\nresearchers working on different species (Ashburner et al. 2000).\nLeonelli (2016) examines many of the epistemic issues the developers\nof GO confronted in developing such a resource. Beyond its original\nfunction, GO is now widely used to interpret network graphs\nmechanistically. By annotating nodes in cellular networks with\ninformation from GO when it is available researchers interpret these\nclusters as corresponding to known mechanisms or sometimes as\nconstituting previously unknown mechanisms. Researchers make\ninferences about nodes for which such information is lacking using\nprinciples such as guilt by association—the entity is\ninferred to occur in the same location or to contribute to the same\nprocess as those with which it clusters (Bechtel 2017 analyzes several examples). \nAs a result of computational models and analyses of large networks,\ncell biology in the twenty-first century is much more focused on\norganization and appears much less reductionistic than it did in the\nmid twentieth century. For some philosophers, this reliance on network\nanalyses represents a move away from mechanistic explanations towards\na process view (Théry 2015; Nicholson 2018; Dupré 2012).\nHuneman (2010, 2018) construes the explanations resulting from network\nanalysis as a distinct type of explanation he labels topological\nexplanation. Others, however, argue that since these analyses\nstill draw upon the components constituting the system and the\nbiologists developing them continue to think of them as mechanistic,\nwe should extend the conception of mechanistic explanation to include\nthe holistic focus on organization developed in computational and\nnetwork analyses (Baetu 2015; Bechtel 2015; Levy 2014). \nWe have focused on core domains of cell biology, concerned with\nexplaining the basic activities of cells. There are, though, many\nspecialized fields concerned with cells. Some of these have become\nactive areas for philosophical inquiry in their own right. Here we\nmerely identify some of these and point readers to relevant work by\nphilosophers, including in several cases entries in the SEP. One such\ndomain is microbiology, concerned with single-cell organisms, whether\nprokaryotic (lacking a nucleus and other organelles) or eukaryotic.\nO’Malley (2014) has identified distinctive features of\nmicroorganisms (e.g., lateral gene transfer) and explores how features\nof microorganismal life challenge major assumptions about living\norganisms that have resulted from focusing predominantly on\nmulti-cellular organisms. In other work (O’Malley 2010), she has\nexamined from a philosophical perspective the competing hypotheses\nabout the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells. Much of\ncell biology has focused on mature cells of specific types and has\nattended less to the processes by which cells in multi-cellular\norganisms differentiate from a common cell, known as a stem\ncell. Fagan (2013) has pioneered the philosophical examination of\nstem-cell research, including the advent of techniques to revert\nmature cells to stem cells. Cells are not only transformed in\ndevelopmental processes in multi-cell organisms, but also in diseases\nsuch as cancer in which cells not only proliferate in uncontrolled\nways but also defeat many normally operating cellular mechanisms that\nnormally prevent proliferation. Plutynski (2018) has identified many\nof the philosophical challenges arising in the efforts to explain\ncancer (see the entry on cancer). An important\ncapability of many multicell organisms is the ability to detect\npathogens, viruses, and other threats and defend against them. Such\nimmune responses require, among other things, the capacity to\ndistinguish cells that belong to the organism itself from others (see\nthe entry on\n philosophy of immunology).\n A fundamental issue that arises in many of these contexts as well as\ntopics raised above is whether and how one should conceptualize cells\nas individuals or agents (see the entry on\n the biological notion of individual). \nIn addition to approaching cells as objects of scientific study,\ncontemporary researchers often adopt an engineering approach to cells.\nOne context is in the domain of synthetic biology in which researchers\nengineer cells, sometimes for research ends but other times to\ngenerate products society finds useful (see the entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n The recent development of gene editing tools such as CRISPR opens up\nboth epistemic and ethical issues (for the ethical issues, see the\nentry on\n neuroethics).\n One context in which attempts to synthesize cells has played a\ncentral role is in the attempt to understand the origins of life. Much\nof the research on origins of life involves the development of\nprotocells—self-organized, spherical systems composed of lipids\n(Rasmussen et al. 2009). This has become a prominent topic of inquiry\nfor both theoretically minded biologists and philosophers of biology\n(see the entry on\n life;\n Bedau 2012; Moreno 2016; Dunér, Malaterre, and Geppert\n2016).","contact.mail":"abollhag@ucsd.edu","contact.domain":"ucsd.edu"}]
