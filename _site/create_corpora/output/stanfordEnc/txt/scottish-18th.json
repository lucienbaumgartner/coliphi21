The movement included major figures, such\nas Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid and Adam\nFerguson, and also many others who produced notable works, such as\nGershom Carmichael, Archibald Campbell, George Turnbull, George\nCampbell, James Beattie, Alexander Gerard, Henry Home (Lord Kames) and\nDugald Stewart. I discuss some of the leading ideas of these thinkers,\nthough paying less attention than I otherwise would to Hume, Smith and\nReid, who have separate Encyclopedia entries. Amongst the topics\ncovered in this entry are aesthetics (particularly Hutcheson’s),\nMoral philosophy (particularly Hutcheson’s and Smith’s),\nTurnbull’s providential naturalism, Kames’s doctrines on\ndivine goodness and human freedom, Campbell’s criticism of the\nHumean account of miracles, the philosophy of rhetoric,\nFerguson’s criticism of the idea of a state of nature, and\nfinally the concept of conjectural history, a concept especially\nassociated with Dugald Stewart. \n\nThe major figures in Scottish eighteenth century philosophy were\nFrancis Hutcheson, David Hume, Adam Smith, Thomas Reid and Adam\nFerguson. Others who produced notable works included Gershom\nCarmichael, Archibald Campbell, George Turnbull, George Campbell,\nJames Beattie, Alexander Gerard, Henry Home (Lord Kames) and Dugald\nStewart. \nGershom Carmichael (1672–1729) studied at Edinburgh University\n(1687–1691), taught at St Andrews University (1693–1694),\nand spent the rest of his life at Glasgow, first as a regent in arts\nand then as professor of moral philosophy. He was a main conduit into\nScotland of the European natural law tradition, a tradition of\nscientific investigation of human nature with a view to constructing\nan account of the principles that are morally binding on us. Among the\ngreat figures of that tradition were Hugo Grotius (1583–1645)\nand Samuel Pufendorf (1632–1694), thinkers whose writings played\na major role in moral philosophical activity in Scotland during the\nAge of Enlightenment.  \nIn 1718, during the first stirrings of the Scottish Enlightenment,\nCarmichael published Supplements and Observations upon the two\nbooks of the distinguished Samuel Pufendorf’s On the Duty of Man\nand Citizen. In 1724 he published a second edition containing\nextensive additional material. Carmichael affirms: “when God\nprescribes something to us, He is simply signifying that he requires\nus to do such and such an action, and regards it, when offered with\nthat intention, as a sign of love and veneration towards him, while\nfailure to perform such actions, and, still worse, commission of the\ncontrary acts, he interprets as an indication of contempt or\nhatred” (Carmichael, [NR], p. 46). Hence we owe God love and\nveneration, and on this basis Carmichael distinguishes between\nimmediate and mediate duties. Our immediate duty is formulated in the\nfirst precept of natural law, that God is to be worshipped. He seeks a\nsign of our love and veneration for him, and worship is the clearest\nmanifestation of these feelings.  \nThe second precept, which identifies our mediate duties, is:\n“Each man should promote, so far as it is in his power, the\ncommon good of the whole human race, and, so far as this allows, the\nprivate good of individuals” ([NR], p. 48). This relates to our\n‘mediate’ duties since we indirectly signify our love and\nveneration of God by treating his creatures well. On this basis,\nCarmichael deploys the distinction between self and others in two\nsubordinate precepts: “Each man should take care to promote his\nown interest without harming others” and “Sociability is\nto be cultivated and preserved by every man so far as in him\nlies.” These precepts, concerning duties to God, to self and to\nothers, are the fundamental precepts of natural law, and though the\nprecept that God is to be worshipped is prior to and more evident than\nthe precept that one should live sociably with men, the requirement\nthat we cultivate sociability is a foundation of the well-lived life.\n \nCarmichael therefore rejects an important aspect of Pufendorf’s\ndoctrine on the cultivation of sociability, for the latter argues that\nthe demand “that every man must cultivate and preserve\nsociability so far as he can” is that to which all our duties\nare subordinate. Yet for Carmichael the precept that we worship God is\nnot traceable back to the duty to cultivate sociability, and therefore\nthe requirement that we cultivate and preserve sociability cannot\nprecede the laws binding us to behave appropriately towards God.  \nFor instance, God is central to the narrative concerning the duty to\ncultivate our mind, for performance of this duty requires that we\ncultivate in ourselves the conviction that God is creator and governor\nof the universe and of us. Carmichael criticises Pufendorf for paying\ntoo little attention to the subject of cultivation of the mind, and\nindicates some features that might profitably have been considered by\nPufendorf, for example the following.  \nDue cultivation of the mind involves filling it with sound opinion\nregarding our duty, learning to judge well the objects which commonly\nstimulate our desires, and acquiring rational control of our passions.\nIt also involves our learning to act on the knowledge that, as regards\nour humanity, we are neither superior nor inferior to other people.\nFinally, a person with a well cultivated mind is aware of how little\nhe knows of what the future holds, and consequently is neither\narrogant at his present happy circumstances nor excessively anxious\nabout ills that might yet assail him.  \nThe Stoic character of this text is evident, as is Carmichael’s\ninjunction that we not be disturbed on account of evils which have\nbefallen us, or which might befall us, due to no fault of ours. The\ndeliberate infringement of the moral law is said however to be another\nmatter; it prompts a discomfort peculiarly hard to bear. In full\nconcord with the Stoic tendency here observed, we find him supporting,\nunder the heading ‘duty to oneself’, a Stoic view of\nanger. Though not expressing unconditional disapproval of anger, he\ndoes point out that it is difficult to keep an outburst of anger\nwithin just limits, and that such an outburst is problematic in\nrelation to natural law, for: “it must be regarded as one of the\nthings which most of all makes human life unsocial, and has pernicious\neffects for the human race. Thus we can scarcely be too diligent in\nrestraining our anger” ([NR], p. 65). Anger conflicts with\nsociability and it is only by due cultivation of the mind that our\nsociability can be fortified and enhanced.  \nThe first of the major philosophers was Francis Hutcheson\n(1694–1746). His reputation rests chiefly on his earlier\nwritings, especially An Inquiry into the Original of our Ideas of\nBeauty and Virtue (London 1725), Reflections upon Laughter\nand Remarks on the Fable of the Bees (both in the Dublin Journal\n1725–1726), and Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the\nPassions with Illustrations on the Moral Sense (London 1728). His\nmagnum opus, A System of Moral Philosophy, was published\nposthumously in Glasgow in 1755; a modern critical edition is awaited.\nDuring his period as a student at Glasgow University (c.\n1711–1717) Gershom Carmichael taught moral philosophy and\njurisprudence there and there are clear signs in Hutcheson’s\nwritings of Carmichael’s influence though it is not known\nwhether he studied under Carmichael during his student days. In 1730\nhe took up the moral philosophy chair left vacant on\nCarmichael’s death. Hutcheson is known principally for his ideas\non moral philosophy and aesthetics. First moral philosophy. \nHutcheson reacted against both the psychological egoism of Thomas\nHobbes and the rationalism of Samuel Clarke and William Wollaston. As\nregards Hobbes, Hutcheson thought his doctrine was both wrong and\ndangerous; wrong because by the frame of our nature we have\ncompassionate, generous and benevolent affections which owe nothing at\nall to calculations of self-interest, and dangerous because people may\nbe discouraged from the morally worthy exercise of cultivating\ngenerous affections in themselves on the grounds that the exercise of\nsuch affections is really an exercise in dissimulation or pretence. As\nagainst Hobbes Hutcheson held that a morally good act is one motivated\nby benevolence, a desire for the happiness of others. Indeed the wider\nthe scope of the act the better, morally speaking, the act is;\nHutcheson was the first to speak of “the greatest happiness for\nthe greatest numbers”. \nHe believed that moral knowledge is gained via our moral sense. A\nsense, as the term is deployed by Hutcheson, is every determination of\nour minds to receive ideas independently of our will, and to have\nperceptions of pleasure and pain. In accordance with this definition,\nthe five external senses determine us to receive ideas which please or\npain us, and the will does not intervene — we open our eyes and\nby natural necessity see whatever it is that we see. But Hutcheson\nthought that there were far more senses than the five external ones.\nThree in particular play a role in our moral life. The public sense is\nthat by which we are pleased with the happiness of others, and are\nuneasy at their misery. The moral sense is that by which we perceive\nvirtue or vice in ourselves or others, and derive pleasure, or pain,\nfrom the perception. And the sense of honour is that which makes the\napprobation, or gratitude of others, for any good actions we have\ndone, the necessary occasion of pleasure. In each of these cases the\nwill is not involved. We see a person acting with the intention of\nbringing happiness to someone else, and by the frame of our nature\npleasure wells up in us. \nHutcheson emphasises both the complexity of the relations between our\nnatural affections and also the need, in the name of morality, to\nexercise careful management of the relations between the affections.\nWe must especially be careful not to let any of our affections get too\n‘passionate’, for a passionate affection might become an\neffective obstacle to other affections that should be given priority.\nAbove all the selfish affections must not be allowed to over-rule\n‘calm universal benevolence’. \nHutcheson’s opposition to Hobbesian egoism is matched by his\nopposition to ethical rationalism, an opposition which emerges in the\nIllustrations upon the Moral Sense, where he demonstrates\nthat his account of the affections and the moral sense makes sense of\nthe moral facts whereas the doctrines of Clarke and Wollaston totally\nfail to do so. Hutcheson’s main thesis against ethical\nrationalism is that all exciting reasons presuppose instincts and\naffections, while justifying reasons presuppose a moral sense. An\nexciting reason is a motive which actually prompts a person to act; a\njustifying reason is one which grounds moral approval of the act.\nHutcheson demonstrates that reason, unlike affection, cannot furnish\nan exciting motive, and that there can be no exciting reason previous\nto affection. Reason does of course play a role in our moral life, but\nonly as helping to guide us to an end antecedently determined by\naffection, in particular the affection of universal benevolence. On\nthis basis, an act can be called ‘reasonable’, but this is\nnot a point on the side of the rationalists, since they hold that\nreason by itself can motivate, and in this case it is affection, not\nreason that motivates, that is, that gets us doing something rather\nthan nothing. \nIf we add to this the fact, as Hutcheson sees it, that it has never\nbeen demonstrated that reason is a fit faculty to determine what the\nends are that we are obliged to seek, we shall see that\nHutcheson’s criticism of rationalism is that it can account for\nneither moral motivation nor moral judgment. On the other hand our\nnatural affections, in particular benevolence, account fully for our\nmoral motivation and our faculty of moral sense accounts fully for our\nability to make an assessment of actions whether our own or\nothers’. \nCertain features of Hutcheson’s moral philosophy appear in his\naesthetic theory also. Indeed the two fields are inextricably related,\nas witness Hutcheson’s reference to the ‘moral sense of\nbeauty’. Two features especially work hard. He contends that we\nsense the beauty, sublimity or grandeur of a sight or of a sound. The\nsense of the thing’s beauty, so to say, wells up unbidden. And\nassociated with that sense, and perhaps even part of it —\nHutcheson does not give us a clear account of the matter — is a\npleasure that we take in the thing. We enjoy beautiful things\nand that enjoyment is not merely incidental to our sensing their\nbeauty. \nA question arises here regarding the features of a thing that cause us\nto see it as beautiful and to take pleasure in it. Hutcheson suggests\nthat a beautiful thing displays unity (or uniformity) amidst variety.\nIf a work has too much uniformity it is simply boring. If it has too\nmuch variety it is a jumble. An object, whether visual or audible,\nrequires therefore to occupy the intermediate position if it is to\ngive rise to a sense of beauty in the object. But if Hutcheson is\nright about the basis of aesthetic judgment how does disagreement\narise? Hutcheson’s reply is that our aesthetic response is\naffected in part by the associations that the thing arouses in our\nmind. If an object that we had found beautiful comes to be associated\nin our mind with something disagreeable this will affect our aesthetic\nresponse; we might even find the thing ugly. Hutcheson gives an\nexample of wines to which men acquire an aversion after they have\ntaken them in an emetic preparation. On this matter his position may\nseem extreme, for he holds that if two people have the same experience\nand if the thing experienced carries the same identical associations\nfor the two people, then they will have the same aesthetic response to\nthe object. The position is however difficult to disprove, since if\ntwo people do in fact disagree about the aesthetic merit of an object,\nHutcheson can say that the object produces different associations in\nthe two spectators. \nNevertheless, Hutcheson does believe aesthetic misjudgments are\npossible, and in the course of explaining their occurrence he deploys\nLocke’s doctrine of association of ideas, a doctrine according\nto which ideas linked solely by chance or custom come to be associated\nin our minds and become almost inseparable from each other though they\nare ‘not at all of kin’. Hutcheson holds that an art\nconnoisseur’s judgment can be distorted through his tendency to\nassociate ideas, and notes in particular that a connoisseur’s\naesthetic response to a work of art is likely to be affected by the\nfact that he owns it, for the pleasure of ownership will tend to\nintermix with and distort the affective response he would otherwise\nhave to the object. Hutcheson, it should be added, is equally\nsensitive to the danger to our moral judgments that is posed by our\nassociative tendency. And in both types of case the best defence\nagainst the threat is reflection, understood as a mental probing, an\nexamination and then cross-examination, whether of a work of art or of\nan action, and of the elements in and aspects of our situation that\nmotivate our judgments, all this with a view to factoring out\nirrelevant considerations. Without such mental exercises we cannot, in\nhis view, obtain what he terms ‘true liberty and\nself-command’. This position, which he presents several times,\npoints to a doctrine of free will not otherwise readily discernible in\nhis writings. Our free will, on this account, is a habit of reflection\nthrough which we form a judgment which we are in a position to defend.\nWe stand back from the object of reflection, do not allow ourselves to\nbe overwhelmed by it, but instead adjudicate it in the light of\nwhatever considerations we judge it appropriate to bring to bear\n(Broadie 2016). \nA philosopher of the early period of the Scottish Enlightenment with\nwhom Hutcheson may helpfully be compared and contrasted is his close\ncontemporary Archibald Campbell (1691–1756), professor of\ndivinity and church history at St Andrews University. Both men studied\nat Glasgow University under John Simson, a professorial divine much\nharassed by conservative Reformists in the Kirk on account of his\nrejection of the Kirk’s doctrine that, since the Fall, human\nnature through the generations has suffered from total depravity. In\ndue course Hutcheson and Campbell were both harassed by the Kirk on\naccount of their claim that human beings are by nature inclined to\nvirtue, for the Kirk took that claim to imply that the two men did not\nfully embrace the doctrine of total depravity. However, beyond this\nagreement Campbell opposes Hutcheson on certain essential points. Most\nespecially, in his Enquiry into the Original of Moral Virtue\n(1733) Campbell rejects Hutcheson’s claim that for an action to\nbe virtuous it must be motivated by a disinterested benevolence, and\nargues to the contrary that all human acts are and can only be\nmotivated by self-love. From which Campbell concludes that all\nvirtuous human acts also are motivated by self-love. This claim,\nthough at first sight Hobbesian, is however not at all of a Hobbesian\nstripe, for Campbell holds that the self-love that motivates us to\nperform a virtuous act takes the form of a desire for esteem, where\nthe desired esteem derives from our gratification of another\nperson’s self-love. As well as writing against Hobbes and\nHutcheson, Campbell also directs his fire at Bernard Mandeville, who\nheld that a virtuous act must involve an exercise of self-denial, in\nthe sense that to act virtuously we have to cut across, or frustrate\nour natural principles, whereas for Campbell, as also for Hutcheson,\nvirtuous acts are performed in realisation of, and not at all in\nconflict with, our nature. The Kirk set up a committee of purity of\ndoctrine to investigate the teachings of Campbell, a Kirk minister who\npainted such a distressingly agreeable picture of human nature. The\nconservatively orthodox Reformists on the Committee wished to move\nagainst him, but the Kirk’s General Assembly, which was already\nbeginning to display an Enlightenment spirit, prevented such a move,\nand Campbell retained his professorship of divinity and his position\nas minister of the Kirk. Campbell’s ideas, till now neglected,\nare at last beginning to receive serious consideration (Maurer 2012,\n2016). \nHutcheson influenced most of the Scottish philosophers who succeeded\nhim, perhaps all of them, whether because he helped to set their\nagenda or because they appropriated, in a form suitable to their\nneeds, certain of his doctrines. In the field of aesthetics for\nexample, where Hutcheson led, many, including Hume, Reid, and\nArchibald Alison, followed. But influences can be hard to pin down and\nthere is much dispute in particular concerning his influence on David\nHume (1711–1776). It is widely held that Hume’s moral\nphilosophy is essentially Hutchesonian, and that Hume took a stage\nfurther Hutcheson’s projects of internalisation and of grounding\nour experience of the world on sentiment or feeling. For Hume agreed\nwith Hutcheson that moral and aesthetic qualities are really\nsentiments existing in our minds, but he also argued that the\nnecessary connection between any pair of events E1 and E2 which are\nrelated as cause to effect is also in our minds, for it is nothing\nmore than a determination of the mind, due to custom or habit, to have\na belief (a kind of feeling) that an event of kind E2 will occur next\nwhen we experience an event of kind E1. Furthermore Hume argues that\nwhat we think of as the ‘external’ world is almost\nentirely a product of our own imaginative activity. As against these\nreasons for thinking Hume indebted to Hutcheson there are the awkward\nfacts that Hutcheson greatly disapproved of the draft of\nTreatise Book III that he saw in 1739 and that Hutcheson did\nhis best to prevent Hume being appointed to the moral philosophy chair\nat Edinburgh University in 1744–1745. In addition many of their\ncontemporaries, such as Adam Smith and Thomas Reid, held that\nHume’s moral philosophy was significantly different from\nHutcheson’s (Moore 1990). \nOne close contemporary of Hutcheson, who also stands in interesting\nrelations to Hume, is George Turnbull (1698–1748), regent at\nMarischal College, Aberdeen (1721–1727), and teacher of Thomas\nReid at Marischal. He describes Hutcheson as “one whom I think\nnot inferior to any modern writer on morals in accuracy and\nperspicuity, but rather superior to almost all” (Principles\nof Moral Philosophy, p. 14), and no doubt Hutcheson was an\ninfluence on Turnbull in several ways. But it has to be borne in mind\nthat the earliest of Turnbull’s writings, Theses\nphilosophicae de scientiae naturalis cum philosophia morali\nconjunctione (Philosophical theses on the unity of natural\nscience and moral philosophy), a graduation oration delivered in 1723\n(Education for Life, pp. 45–57), shows Turnbull already\nworking on a grand project that might be thought of as roughly\nHutchesonian, but doing so several years before Hutcheson’s\nearliest published work (Turnbull [EL]). As regards Turnbull’s\nrelationship with Hume, we should recall that the subtitle of\nHume’s Treatise of Human Nature is “An attempt to\nintroduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral\nsubjects”. As with Hume’s Treatise, so also\nTurnbull’s Principles of Moral Philosophy, published in\n1740 (the year of publication of Bk. III of the Treatise) but\nbased on lectures given in Aberdeen in the mid-1720s, contains a\ndefence of the claim that natural and moral philosophy are very\nsimilar types of enquiry. When Turnbull tells us that all enquiries\ninto fact, reality, or any part of nature must be set about, and\ncarried on in the same way, he is bearing in mind the fact, as he sees\nit to be one, that there are moral facts and a moral reality, and that\nour moral nature is part of nature and therefore to be investigated by\nthe methods appropriate to the investigation of the natural world. As\nthe natural philosopher relies on experience of the external world, so\nthe moral philosopher relies on his experience of the internal world.\nLikewise, writing in Humean terms, but uninfluenced by Hume, Turnbull\naffirms: “every Enquiry about the Constitution of the human\nMind, is as much a question of Fact or natural History, as Enquiries\nabout Objects of Sense are: It must therefore be managed and carried\non in the same way of Experiment, and in the one case as well as in\nthe other, nothing ought to be admitted as Fact, till it is clearly\nfound to be such from unexceptionable Experience and\nObservation” (Education for Life, pp. 342–3). It\nis, in Turnbull’s judgment, the failure to respect this\nexperimental method that led to the moral scepticism (as Turnbull\nthought it to be) of Hobbes and Mandeville, whose reduction of\nmorality to self-love flies in the face of experience and shocks\ncommon sense. \nThe experience in question is of the reality of the public affection\nin our nature, the immediate object of which is the good of others,\nand the reality of the moral sense by which we are determined to\napprove such affections. This moral sense, of whose workings we are\nall aware, is the faculty by which, without the mediation of rational\nactivity, we approve of virtuous acts and disapprove of vicious ones;\nand the approval and disapproval rise up in us without any regard for\nself-love or self-interest. In a very Hutchesonian way Turnbull\ninvites us to consider the difference we feel when faced with two acts\nwhich are the same except for the fact that one of them is performed\nfrom love of another person and the other act is performed from\nself-interest. These facts about our nature have to be accommodated\nwithin moral philosophy just as the fact that heavy bodies tend to\nfall has to be accommodated within natural philosophy. \nTurnbull is committed to a form of reliabilism according to which the\nfaculties that we have by the frame or constitution of our nature are\ntrustworthy. It is not simply that we are so constructed that we\ncannot but accept their deliverances; it is that we are also entitled\nto accept them. Turnbull, a deeply committed Christian, believed that\nthe author of our nature would not have so constituted us as to accept\nthe deliverances of our nature if our nature could not be relied upon\nto deliver up truth. We are in the hands of providence, and live\ndirected towards the truth for that reason. This doctrine has been\ntermed ‘providential naturalism’, and bears a marked\nresemblance to the language and also to the substance of the position\nheld by Turnbull’s pupil Thomas Reid. \nHenry Home, Lord Kames, likewise taught a version of providential\nnaturalism. In his Essays on the Principles of Morality and\nNatural Religion he has a good deal to say about the senses\nexternal and internal, treating them as enabling us, by the original\nframe of our nature, to gain access, without the use of reasoning\nprocesses, to the realities in the corresponding domains, including\nthe moral domain. Kames’s moral sense has as much to do with\naesthetics as with morality; or rather, for Kames, no less than for\nHutcheson, virtue is a kind of beauty, moral beauty, as vice is moral\ndeformity. Beauty itself is ascribed to anything that gives pleasure.\nAnd as there are degrees of pleasure and pain, so also there are\ndegrees of beauty and ugliness. In the lowest rank are things\nconsidered without regard to an end or a designing agent. The\npossibility of greater pleasure, and of the ascription of greater\nbeauty, arises when an object is considered with respect to the\nobject’s end. A house, considered in itself, might be beautiful,\nbut how much more beautiful is it judged to be if it is seen to be\nwell designed for human occupancy. \nApprobation, as applied to works of art, is our pleasure at them when\nwe consider them to be well fitted or suited to an end. The\napprobation is greater if the end for which the object is well suited\nalso gives pleasure. A ship may give pleasure because it is so\nshapely, and also give pleasure because it is well suited to trade,\nand also give pleasure because trade also is a fine thing. If these\nfurther thing are taken into account the beauty of the ship is\nenhanced. Kames argues that these kinds of pleasure can also be taken\nin human actions, and that human acts can cause pleasure additionally\nby the special fact about them that they proceed from intention,\ndeliberation and choice. In the case of, for example, an act of\ngenerosity towards a worthy person, the act is intentionally well\nsuited, or fitted, to an end whose beauty is recognised by the agent.\nThe fact that observation of acts displaying generosity, and other\nvirtues, gives us pleasure is due to the original constitution of our\nnature. The pleasure arises unbidden, and no exercise of will or\nreason is required, any more than we require to use our reason to see\nthe beauty of a landscape or a work of art. \nKames wrote extensively on revealed and natural theology. As regards\nthe latter, he often has Hume in his sights, particularly Hume’s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779), with whose\ncontents Kames was familiar decades before the work’s\npublication. Hume held that in an inference from effect to cause no\nmore should be assigned to the cause than is sufficient to explain the\neffect. In particular, if we argue from the existence of the natural\nworld to the existence of God we should ascribe to God only such\nattributes as are requisite for the explanation of the world. And\nsince the world is imperfect, why not say that we are not constrained\nby the facts in the natural order to ascribe perfection to God? Kames,\non the other hand, holds that there are principles implanted in our\nnature that permit us to draw conclusions that reason alone does not\nsanction. If something is a tendency of our nature then we have to\nrely on it as a source of truth. Invoking just such a tendency Kames\naffirms that though we see both good and evil around us we do not\nconclude that the cause of the world must also be a mixture of good\nand evil: “it is a tendency of our nature to reject a mixed\ncharacter of benevolence and malevolence, unless where it is\nnecessarily pressed home upon us by an equality of opposite effects;\nand in every subject that cannot be reached by the reasoning faculty,\nwe justly rely on the tendency of our nature” (Essays,\np. 353). In any case Kames sees a world which is predominantly good\neven though it has ‘a few cross instances’. But the few\ncross instances might not look so cross, or even at all cross, if we\nhad a fuller perspective, and Kames anticipates the time when that\nperspective will be granted us. \nThis latter position did not raise the hackles of the zealots among\nthe Presbyterian clergy in Scotland, but Kames’s position on\nfree will caused a furore and he had to defend himself from attempts\nto expel him from the Kirk. Kames, accepting the concept of history,\nnatural and human, as the gradual realisation of a divine plan,\nbelieved in universal necessity. The laws ordained by God\n“produce a regular train of causes and effects in the moral as\nwell as material world, bringing about those events which are\ncomprehended in the original plan, and admitting the possibility of\nnone other” (Essays, p. 192). On the other hand, if we\nare to fulfill our role in the grand scheme we must see ourselves as\nable to initiate things, that is, to be the free cause of their\noccurrence. God has therefore, according to Kames, concealed from us\nthe necessity of our acts and he is therefore a deceitful God. Kames\nsought to explain how this divine deceit enables us to live as morally\naccountable beings, but this latter part of his philosophy did nothing\nto placate those in the Kirk for whom the affirmation of a deceitful\nGod was a sacrilege. Kames, however, could not see any difference\nbetween the deception by which we believe ourselves to be free when in\nfact we are necessitated and the deception by which we believe\nsecondary qualities, such as colours and sounds, to be in the external\nworld and able to get along without us, when in fact they depend for\ntheir existence upon the exercise of our own sensory powers. \nKames did not dedicate an entire book to an attack on Hume on\nreligion, but George Campbell (1719–1796) did. This interesting\nman, a student at Marischal College, Aberdeen, of which in 1759 he\nbecame Principal, was a founder-member of the Aberdeen Philosophical\nSociety, the ‘Wise Cub’, which also included Thomas Reid,\nJohn Gregory, David Skene, Alexander Gerard, James Beattie and James\nDunbar. It is probable that many of Campbell’s writings began\nlife as papers to the Club. In 1763 he published A Dissertation on\nMiracles which was intended as a demolition of Hume’s essay\n‘On miracles’, Chapter Ten in An Enquiry Concerning\nHuman Understanding. Miracles were commonly discussed in\neighteenth century Scotland. On the one hand the Kirk required people\nto accept miracle claims on the basis either of eyewitness reports or\nof reports of such reports, and on the other hand the spirit of\nEnlightenment required that claims based on the authority of others be\nput before the tribunal of reason. Hume focuses especially on the\ncredibility of testimony, and argues that the credence we place in\ntestimony is based entirely on experience, the experience of the\noccasions when testimony has turned out to be true as against those\nexperiences where it has not. Likewise it is on the basis of\nexperience that we judge whether a reported event occurred. If the\nreported event is improbable we ask how probable it is that the\neyewitness is speaking truly. We have to balance the probability that\nthe eyewitness is speaking truly against the improbability of the\noccurrence of the event. Hume held that the improbability of a miracle\nis always so great that no testimony could tell effectively in its\nfavour. The wise man, proportioning his belief to the evidence, would\nbelieve that the testimony in favour of the miracle is false. \nCampbell’s opening move against this argument is to reject\nHume’s premiss that we believe testimony solely on the basis of\nexperience. For, according to Campbell, there is in all of us a\nnatural tendency to believe other people. This is not a learned\nresponse based on repeated experience but an innate disposition. In\npractice this principle of credulity is gradually finessed in the\nlight of experience. Once testimony is placed before us it becomes the\ndefault position, something that is true unless or until proved false,\nnot false unless or until proved true. The credence we give to\ntestimony is much like the credence we give to memory. It is the\ndefault position as regards beliefs about the past, even though in the\nlight of experience we might withhold belief from some of its\ndeliverances. \nBecause our tendency to accept testimony is innate, it is harder to\noverturn than Hume believes it to be. Campbell considers the case of a\nferry that has safely made a crossing two thousand times. I, who have\nseen these safe crossings, meet a stranger who tells me solemnly that\nhe has just seen the boat sink taking with it all on board. The\nlikelihood of my believing this testimony is greater than would be\nimplied by Hume’s formula for determining the balance of\nprobabilities. Reid, a close friend of Campbell’s, likewise gave\nmassive emphasis to the role of testimony, stressing both the innate\nnature of the credence we give to testimony and also the very great\nproportion of our knowledge of the world that we gain, not through\nperception or reason, but through the testimony of others.\nReid’s comparison of the credence we naturally give to the\ntestimony of others and the credence we naturally give to the\ndeliverances of our senses, is one of the central features of his\nInquiry into the Human Mind (1764). \nA number of eighteenth century Scots, including James Burnett (Lord\nMonboddo), Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, Hugh Blair and James Dunbar, made\nsignificant contributions in the field of language and rhetoric.\nGeorge Campbell’s The Philosophy of Rhetoric (London\n1776) is a large-scale essay in which he takes a roughly Aristotelian\nposition on the relation between logic and rhetoric, since he holds\nthat convincing an audience, which is the province of rhetoric or\neloquence, is a particular application of the logician’s art.\nThe central insight from which Campbell is working is that the orator\nseeks to persuade people, and in general the best way to persuade is\nto produce perspicuous arguments. Good orators have to be good\nlogicians. Their grammar also must be sound. This double requirement\nof orators leads Campbell to make a sharp distinction between logic\nand grammar, on the grounds that though both have rules, the rules of\nlogic are universal and those of grammar particular. Though there are\nmany natural languages there is but one set of rules of logic, and on\nthe other hand different languages have different rules of grammar. It\nis against a background of discussion by prominent writers on language\nsuch as Locke and James (‘Hermes’) Harris that Campbell\ntakes his stand with the claim that there cannot be such a thing as a\nuniversal grammar. His argument is that there cannot be a universal\ngrammar unless there is a universal language, and there is no such\nthing as a universal language, just many particular languages. There\nare, he grants, collections of rules that some have presented under\nthe heading ‘universal grammar’. But, protests, Campbell,\n“such collections convey the knowledge of no tongue\nwhatever”. His position stands in interesting relation to\nReid’s frequent appeals to universals of language in support of\nthe claim that given beliefs are held by all humankind. \nCampbell was a leading member of the school of common sense\nphilosophy. For him common sense is an original source of knowledge\ncommon to humankind, by which we are assured of a number of truths\nthat cannot be evinced by reason and “it is equally impossible,\nwithout a full conviction of them, to advance a single step in the\nacquisition of knowledge” (Philosophy of Rhetoric, vol.\n1, p. 114). His account is much in line with that of his colleague\nJames Beattie: “that power of the mind which perceives truth, or\ncommands belief, not by progressive argumentation, but by an\ninstantaneous, instinctive, and irresistible impulse; derived neither\nfrom education nor from habit, but from nature; acting independently\non our will, whenever its object is presented, according to an\nestablished law, and therefore properly called Sense; and acting in a\nsimilar manner upon all, or at least upon a great majority of mankind,\nand therefore properly called Common Sense” (An\nEssay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, p. 40). We are\nplainly in the same territory as Reid’s account: “there\nare principles common to [philosophers and the vulgar], which need no\nproof, and which do not admit of direct proof”, and these common\nprinciples “are the foundation of all reasoning and\nscience” (Reid [EIP]). \nThese philosophers do however disagree about substantive matters. In\nparticular, Reid lists as the first principle of common sense:\n“The operations of our minds are attended with consciousness;\nand this consciousness is the evidence, the only evidence which we\nhave or can have of their existence” (Reid [EIP], p. 41).\nCampbell on the other hand lists three sorts of intuitive evidence.\nThe first concerns our unmediated insight into the truth of\nmathematical axioms and the third concerns common sense principles.\nThe second concerns the deliverances of consciousness, consciousness\nbeing the faculty through which we learn directly of the occurrence of\nmental acts — thinking, remembering, being in pain, and so on.\nWhat is listed as a principle of common sense by Reid is, therefore,\naccording to Campbell, to be contrasted with such principles. Aside\nfrom this, however, it is clear that Campbell is philosophically very\nclose to Reid, even if Reid is unquestionably the greater\nphilosopher. \nReid and Hume both owed an immense debt to Hutcheson. So also did Adam\nSmith (1723–1790) who, unlike the others, studied under\nHutcheson at Glasgow University. In 1751 Smith was appointed to the\nchair of logic and rhetoric at Glasgow and the following year\ntransferred to the chair of moral philosophy that Hutcheson had\noccupied. Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of\nthe Wealth of Nations appeared in 1776. Essays on\nPhilosophical Subjects appeared posthumously in 1795. He also\npublished an essay on the first formation of languages, and student\nnotes of his lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres, and on\njurisprudence have survived. But much his most important work in\nphilosophy is the Theory of Moral Sentiments which appeared\nin 1759 and of which six authorised editions appeared during\nSmith’s lifetime. \nThe concepts of sympathy and spectatorship, central to the doctrine of\nTMS, had already been put to work by Hutcheson and Hume, but\nSmith’s account is distinct. As spectator of an agent’s\nsuffering we form in our imagination a copy of such ‘impression\nof our own senses’ as we have experienced when we have been in a\nsituation of the kind the agent is in: “we enter as it were into\nhis body, and become in some measure the same person with the\nagent” (Smith 1790, p. 9). Smith gives two spectacular examples\nof cases where the spectator has a sympathetic feeling that does not\ncorrespond to the agent’s. The first concerns the agent who has\nlost his reason. He is happy, unaware of his tragic situation. The\nspectator imagines how he himself would feel if reduced to this same\nsituation. In this imaginative experiment, in which the spectator is\noperating on the edge of a contradiction, the spectator’s idea\nof the agent’s situation plays a large role while his idea of\nthe agent’s actual feelings has a role only in that the\nagent’s happiness is itself evidence of his tragedy. The second\nof Smith’s examples is the spectator’s sympathy for the\ndead, deprived of sunshine, conversation and company. Again Smith\nemphasises the agent’s situation, and asks how the spectator\nwould feel if in the agent’s situation, deprived of everything\nthat matters to people. \nSmith relates sympathy to approval. For a spectator to approve of an\nagent’s feelings is for him to observe that he sympathises with\nthe agent. This account is used as the basis of the analysis of\npropriety. For a spectator to judge that an agent’s act is\nproper or appropriate is for him to approve of the agent’s act.\nThe agent’s act lacks propriety, in the judgment of the\nspectator, if the spectator does not sympathise with the agent’s\nperformance. \nPropriety and impropriety are based on a bilateral relation, between\nspectator and agent. Smith attends also to a trilateral relation,\nbetween a spectator, an agent who acts on someone, and the person who\nis acted on, the ‘recipient’ of the act. There are several\nkinds of response that the recipient may make to the agent’s\nact, and Smith focuses on two, gratitude and resentment. If the\nspectator judges the recipient’s gratitude proper or appropriate\nthen he approves of the agent’s act and judges it meritorious,\nor worthy of reward. If he judges the recipient’s resentment\nproper or appropriate then he disapproves of the agent’s act and\njudges it demeritorious, or worthy of punishment. Judgments of merit\nor demerit concerning a person’s act are therefore made on the\nbasis of an antecedent judgment concerning the propriety or\nimpropriety of another person’s reaction to that act. Sympathy\nunderlies all these judgments, for in the cases just mentioned the\nspectator sympathises with the recipient’s gratitude and with\nhis resentment. He has direct sympathy with the affections and motives\nof the agent and indirect sympathy with the recipient’s\ngratitude; or in judging the agent’s behaviour improper the\nspectator has indirect sympathy with the agent’s resentment\n(Smith 1790, p. 74). \nWe have supposed, in each of these cases, that the recipient really\ndoes have the feeling in question, whether of gratitude or resentment.\nHowever, in Smith’s account the spectator’s belief about\nwhat the recipient actually feels about the agent is not important for\nthe spectator’s judgment concerning the merit and demerit of the\nagent. The recipient may, for whatever reason, resent an act that was\nkindly intentioned and in all other ways admirable, and the spectator,\nknowing the situation better than the recipient does, puts himself\nimaginatively in the shoes of the recipient while taking with him into\nthis spectatorial role information about the agent’s behaviour\nthat the recipient lacks. The spectator judges that were he himself in\nthe recipient’s situation he would be grateful for the\nagent’s act; and on that basis, and independently of the\nrecipient’s actual reaction, he approves of the agent’s\nact and judges it meritorious. Here the spectator considers himself as\na better (because better informed) spectator of the agent’s act\nthan the recipient is. \nAs regards judgments of merit and demerit, Smith sets up a model of\nthree people, but the three differ in respect of the weight that has\nto be given to their work, for the recipient does almost nothing. He\nis acted on by the agent, but apart from that he is no more than a\nplace holder for the spectator who will imaginatively occupy his shoes\nand make a judgment concerning merit or demerit on the basis solely of\nhis conception of how he would respond to the agent if he were in the\nplace of the recipient. He does not judge on the basis of the actual\nreaction of the recipient, who might approve of the agent’s act\nor disapprove or have no feelings about it one way or the other. \nUp to this point we have attended to the spectator’s moral\njudgment of the acts of others. What of his judgment of his own acts?\nIn judging the other the spectator has the advantage of disinterest,\nbut he may lack requisite information and much of the work of creative\nimagination goes into his rectifying the lack. In judging himself he\nhas, or may be presumed to have, the requisite information but he has\nthe problem of overcoming the tendency to a distorted judgment caused\nby self-love or self-interest. He must therefore factor out of his\njudgment those features that are due to self-love. He does this by\nsetting up, by an act of creative imagination, a spectator, an\nother who, qua spectator, is at a distance from\nhim.The point about the distance is that it creates the possibility of\ndisinterest or impartiality, but it is still necessary to ask how\ndisinterest or impartiality is achieved if it is the agent himself who\nimagines the spectator into existence. \nLet us move to an answer by wondering who or what it is that is\nimagined into existence? Is it the voice of society, representing\nestablished social attitudes? At times in the first edition of The\nTheory of Moral Sentiments Smith comes close to saying that it\nis. In the second edition Smith is clear that this is not the role of\nthe impartial spectator for the latter can, and occasionally does,\nspeak against established social attitudes. Nor can the judgment of\nthe impartial spectator be reduced to the judgment of society, even\nwhere those two judgments coincide. Nevertheless the impartial\nspectator exists because of real live spectators. Were it not for our\ndiscovery that while we are judging other people, those same people\nare judging us, we would not form the idea of a spectator judging us\nimpartially. \nThe impartial spectator is a product of the imagination, and its mode\nof existence is therefore intentional — it has what medieval\nphilosophers termed esse intentionale as against esse\nnaturale. In one sense therefore it should be thought of not as a\nreal spectator who has the merit of being impartial, but as an ideal\nspectator in the sense of one that exists as an idea. In another sense\nthe impartial spectator is real, for it is no other than the agent who\nis imagining it into existence. \nSmith’s account of justice is built upon his account of the\nspectator’s sympathetic response to the recipient of an\nagent’s act. If a spectator sympathises with a recipient’s\nresentment at the agent’s act then he judges the act\ndemeritorious and the agent worthy of punishment. In the latter case\nthe moral quality attributed to the act is injustice. An act of\ninjustice “does a real and positive hurt to some particular\npersons, from motives which are naturally disapproved of” (Smith\n1790, p. 79). Since a failure to act justly has a tendency to result\nin injury, while a failure to act charitably or generously does not, a\ndistinction is drawn by Smith, in line with Humean thinking, between\njustice and the other social virtues, on the basis that it is so much\nmore important to prevent injury than promote positive good that the\nproper response to injustice is punishment, whereas we do not feel it\nappropriate to punish someone who does not act charitably or\ngratefully. In a word, we have a stricter obligation to justice than\nto the other virtues. \nThough there are important points of contact between Smith’s\naccount of justice and Hume’s, the differences are considerable,\nchief of them being the fact that Hume grounds our approval of justice\non our recognition of its utility, and Smith does not. We do sometimes\ntake it into account in coming to a judgment, but more often than not\nit is something of a quite different nature that wells up in us:\n“All men, even the most stupid and unthinking, abhor fraud,\nperfidy, and injustice, and delight to see them punished. But few men\nhave reflected upon the necessity of justice to the existence of\nsociety, how obvious soever that necessity may appear to be”\n(Smith 1790, p. 89). There are a few cases where utility is plainly\ninvolved in our judgment, but they are few, and they are in a distinct\npsychological class. Smith instances the sentinel who fell asleep\nwhile on watch and was executed because such carelessness might\nendanger the whole army. Smith’s comment is: “When the\npreservation of an individual is inconsistent with the safety of a\nmultitude, nothing can be more just than that the many should be\npreferred to the one. Yet this punishment, how necessary soever,\nalways appears to be excessively severe. The natural atrocity of the\ncrime seems to be so little, and the punishment so great, that it is\nwith great difficulty that our heart can reconcile itself to it”\n(Smith 1790, p. 90). And our reaction in this kind of case is to be\ncontrasted with our reaction to the punishment of ‘an ungrateful\nmurderer or parricide’, where we applaud the punishment with\nardour and would be enraged and disappointed if the murderer escaped\npunishment. These very different reactions demonstrate that our\napproval of punishment in the one case and in the other are founded on\nvery different principles. \nSmith devotes considerable space to the Stoic virtue of self-command.\nAnother eighteenth century Scottish thinker who devotes considerable\nspace to it is Hugh Blair (1718–1800), minister of the High Kirk\nof St Giles in Edinburgh and first professor of rhetoric and belles\nlettres at Edinburgh University. Blair’s sermons bear ample\nwitness to his interest in Stoic virtue. For example, in the sermon\n‘On our imperfect knowledge of a future state’ he wonders\nwhy we have been left in the dark about our future state. Blair\nreplies that to see clearly into our future would have disastrous\nconsequences. We would be so spellbound by the sight that we would\nneglect the arts and labours which support social order and promote\nthe happiness of society. We are, believes Blair, in ‘the\nchildhood of existence’, being educated for immortality. The\neducation is of such a nature as to enable us to develop virtues such\nas self-control and self-denial. These are Stoic virtues, and\nBlair’s sermons are full of the need to be Stoical. In his\nsermon ‘Of the proper estimate of human life’ he says:\n“if we cannot control fortune, [let us] study at least to\ncontrol ourselves.” Only through exercise of self- control is a\nvirtuous life possible, and only through virtue can we attain\nhappiness. He adds that the search for worldly pleasure is bound to\nend in disappointment and that that is just as well. For it is through\nthe failure of the search that we come to a realisation both of the\nessential vanity of the life we have been living and also of the need\nto turn to God and to virtue. For many, the fact of suffering is the\nstrongest argument there is against the existence of God. Blair on the\ncontrary holds that our suffering provides us with a context within\nwhich we can discover that our true nature is best realised by the\nadoption of a life-plan whose overarching principle is religious. \nOne of Blair’s colleagues at Edinburgh University was Adam\nFerguson (1723–1816). He succeeded David Hume as librarian of\nthe Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh and then held in succession\ntwo chairs at Edinburgh University, that of natural philosophy\n(1759–1764) and of pneumatics and moral philosophy\n(1764–1785). His most influential work is An Essay on the\nHistory of Civil Society (1767). Ferguson attended to one of the\nmain concepts of the Enlightenment, that of human progress, and\nexpressed doubts about whether over the centuries the proportion of\nhuman happiness to unhappiness had increased. He believed that each\nperson accommodates himself to the conditions in his own society and\nthe fact that we cannot imagine that we would be contented if we lived\nin an earlier society does not imply that people in earlier societies\nwere not, more or less, as happy in their own society as we are in\nours. As against our unscientific conjectures about how we would have\nfelt in a society profoundly unlike the only one we have ever lived\nin, Ferguson commends the use of historical records. He talks\ndisparagingly about boundless regions of ignorance in our conjectures\nabout other societies, and among those he has in mind who speak\nignorantly about earlier conditions of humanity are Hobbes, Rousseau\nand Hume in their discussions of the state of nature and the origins\nof society. \nHobbes and Rousseau in particular had a good deal to say about the\npre-social condition of humankind. Ferguson argues, against their\ntheories, that there are no records whatever of a pre-social human\ncondition; and since on the available evidence humankind has always\nlived in society he concludes that living in society comes naturally\nto us. Hence the state of nature is a social state and is not\nantecedent to it. \nOne colleague of Blair and Ferguson at Edinburgh University was Dugald\nStewart (1753–1828), who was a student first at Edinburgh, and\nthen at Glasgow where his moral philosophy professor was Thomas Reid.\nStewart succeeded his father in the chair of mathematics at Edinburgh,\nand then in 1785 became professor of pneumatic and moral philosophy at\nEdinburgh when Ferguson resigned the chair. Stewart shared with\nFerguson an interest in the kind of historical (or pseudo-historical)\nwritings to be found in Hobbes’ Leviathan and\nRousseau’s Contrat Social. In his Account of the\nLife and Writings of Adam Smith LL.D. Dugald Stewart says of one\nof Smith’s works, the Dissertation on the Origin of\nLanguages (Smith [LRB], pp. 201–26), that “it\ndeserves our attention less, on account of the opinions it contains,\nthan as a specimen of a particular sort of inquiry, which, so far as I\nknow, is entirely of modern origin” (Smith 1795, p. 292).\nStewart then spells out the ‘particular sort of inquiry’\nthat he has in mind. He notes the lack of direct evidence for the\norigin of language, of the arts and the sciences, of political union,\nand so on, and affirms: “In this want of direct evidence, we are\nunder a necessity of supplying the place of fact by conjecture; and\nwhen we are unable to ascertain how men have actually conducted\nthemselves upon particular occasions, of considering in what manner\nthey are likely to have proceeded, from the principles of their\nnature, and the circumstances of their external situation”\n(Smith 1795, p. 293). \nFor Stewart such enquiries are of practical importance, for by them\n“a check is given to that indolent philosophy, which refers to a\nmiracle, whatever appearances, both in the natural and moral worlds,\nit is unable to explain” (Smith 1795, p. 293). Stewart uses the\nterm ‘conjectural history’ for the sort of history\nexemplified by Smith’s account of the origin of language.\nConjectural history works against the illegitimate encroachment of\nreligion into the lives of people who are too quick to reach for God\nas the solution to a problem when extrapolation from scientifically\nestablished principles of human nature would provide a solution\nsatisfying to the intellect. Knowing what we do about human nature,\nabout our intellect and will, our emotions and fundamental beliefs, we\nask how people would have behaved in given circumstances. Love and\nhate, anger and jealousy, joy and fear, do not change much through the\ngenerations. Much the same things, speaking generally, have much the\nsame effect first on the emotions and then on behaviour. Dugald\nStewart formulates the principle underlying conjectural history: it\nhas “long been received as an incontrovertible logical maxim\nthat the capacities of the human mind have been in all ages the same,\nand that the diversity of phenomena exhibited by our species is the\nresult merely of the different circumstances in which men are\nplaced” (Stewart 1854–58, vol. 1, p. 69). \nAs regards the credentials of Stewart’s ‘incontrovertible\nlogical maxim’, if the claim that human nature is invariant is\nan empirical claim, it must be based on observation of our\ncontemporaries and on evidence of people’s lives in other places\nand at other times. Such evidence needs however to be handled with\ncare. The further back we go the more meagre it is, and so the more we\nneed to conjecture to supplement the few general facts available to\nus. Indeed we can go back so far that we have no facts beyond the\ngeneralities that we have worked out in the light of our experience.\nBut to rely on conjecture in order to support the very principle that\nforms the first premiss in any exercise in conjectural history is to\ncome suspiciously close to arguing in a circle. The incontrovertible\nlogical maxim of Dugald Stewart should probably be accorded at most\nthe status of a well-supported empirical generalisation. \nConjectural history is certainly not pure guesswork. We argue on the\nbasis of observed uniformities, and the more experience we have of\ngiven uniformities the greater credence we will give to reports that\nspeak of the occurrence of the uniformities, whether they concern dead\nmatter or living people and their institutions. In a famous passage\nHume writes: “Whether we consider mankind according to the\ndifference of sexes, ages, governments, conditions, or methods of\neducation; the same uniformity and regular operation of natural\nprinciples are discernible. Like causes still produce like effects; in\nthe same manner as in the mutual action of the elements and powers of\nnature” (Hume [T], p. 401). \nFor Hume the chief point about the similarity between ourselves and\nour ancestors is that histories greatly contribute to the scientific\naccount of human nature by massively extending our otherwise very\nlimited observational data base. Hume writes: “Mankind are so\nmuch the same, in all times and places, that history informs us of\nnothing new or strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to\ndiscover the constant and universal principles of human nature, by\nshowing men in all varieties of circumstances and situations, and\nfurnishing us with materials from which we may form our observations\nand become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and\nbehaviour. These records of wars, intrigues, factions, and\nrevolutions, are so many collections of experiments, by which the\npolitician or moral philosopher fixes the principles of his science,\nin the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes\nacquainted with the nature of plants, minerals, and other external\nobjects, by the experiments which he forms concerning them”\n(Hume [E], pp. 83–84). On this account of history, it is perhaps\nthe single most important resource for the philosopher seeking to\nconstruct a scientific account of human nature. Among the historians\nproduced by eighteenth century Scotland were Turnbull, Hume, Smith and\nFerguson. In light of Hume’s observation it is not surprising\nthat so much history was written by men prominent for their\nphilosophical writings on human nature.","contact.mail":"Alexander.Broadie@glasgow.ac.uk","contact.domain":"glasgow.ac.uk"}]
