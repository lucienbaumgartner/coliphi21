But this description notices only one aspect of\nhis thought and invites misunderstanding because of its\nambiguities. His ideas spring from a lifetime of reading in the\nhistory of European thought, sharpened by philosophical reflection on\nits arguments and presuppositions. Oakeshott worked on the premise\nthat philosophical questions are interconnected and that answering\nthem requires wide-ranging critical reflection. A recurrent theme in\nhis writings on moral and political life is the tension between\nindividuality, which implies plurality, and its denial, which he calls\nbarbarism. Individual freedom is threatened when politics is conceived\nas the pursuit of ideals. The recent interest of political\nphilosophers in the republican idea of freedom as independence or\nnondomination suggests the continuing relevance of his thought. So\ndoes their interest in political realism as an alternative to\nmoralism. But Oakeshott’s contribution to philosophy is not\nlimited to political philosophy. It includes reflection on the\ncriteria for distinguishing different modes of thought from one\nanother, defining historical inquiry as one such mode, identifying\ndifferent conceptions of rationality and their place in practical\njudgment, and distinguishing competing understandings of the modern\nstate. Oakeshott also wrote on religion, morals, education,\naesthetics, Hobbes, and the history of political thought. Instead of\nsurveying all these topics, this entry will focus on his most\nimportant contributions to philosophy: his theory of modes, his\ncriticism of political rationalism, his argument that the key\ndistinction in modern politics concerns the character and purpose of\nthe state, and his philosophy of history.\n\n \nMichael Oakeshott’s father, Joseph Oakeshott, was a member\nof the Fabian Society, a socialist but not radical organization (its\nsymbol was the tortoise), many of whose members participated in\nestablishing the British Labor Party. The Society’s leaders,\nBeatrice and Sidney Webb, were among the founders of the London School\nof Economics. The younger Oakeshott studied history at Gonville and\nCaius College, Cambridge, in the early 1920s and became a life fellow\nin 1925. After serving in the British Army between 1940 and 1945, he\nreturned to Cambridge, then taught briefly at Nuffield College,\nOxford, before becoming Professor of Political Science at the LSE in\n1951. At some point during his years at the LSE he launched an annual\ncourse of lectures in the history of political thought. Focused\ninitially on canonical authors and texts, after the fashion of the\nlectures he delivered at Harvard in 1958 (Oakeshott 1993b), the course\ngradually became a more comprehensive examination of the political\nexperience and thought of four peoples: the ancient Greeks, the\nRomans, medieval Christians, and modern Europeans (Oakeshott 2006). He\nalso led a seminar in the history of political thought for\npostgraduate students and, as an emeritus professor, was active in it\nuntil 1980, contributing papers on the historical study of political\nthought and the philosophy of history. Brief accounts of\nOakeshott’s life can be found in two memorial collections\n(Norman 1993; Marsh 2001) and a biographical essay (Grant 2012). The\nnotebooks Oakeshott kept for much of his life (Oakeshott 2014) offer\nadditional insights, as do his unpublished letters. \n\nAlthough Oakeshott criticized the postwar Labor government’s\nbelief in planning, in his youth he thought of himself as a\nsocialist. But it was a romantic socialism concerned with spiritual\ntransformation, not economic redistribution (L. O’Sullivan\n2014). And though he later repudiated Fabianism, Marxism, and other\nleft-wing ideologies, the late Oakeshott still sympathized with the\nanarchism of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, sharing the latter’s vision\nof a liberal order combining community and equality with individuality\nand independence. His reputation as a conservative thinker was\nsubstantially shaped by his trenchant essays on the limits of reason\nin political life, collected as Rationalism in Politics and Other\nEssays (first edition 1962, cited hereafter as RP). On\nthe basis of these essays he has been compared to a host of\nconservative figures from Burke to Wittgenstein. Others argue that he\nis better characterized as a liberal. As a theorist of the rule of\nlaw, he invites comparison with Friedrich Hayek and Carl Schmitt. But\nefforts to label Oakeshott as either conservative or liberal founder\nnot only on the ambiguities of those terms but on the partisanship\nthey imply: Oakeshott was emphatically not politically engaged. As he\nprovocatively informed those attending the twentieth-anniversary\ncelebration of the National Review in 1975, the Right’s\ndifferences with the Left were a petty squabble over how the spoils of\nthe state as a corporate enterprise were to be distributed\n(RP 459). To grasp the philosophical significance of\nOakeshott’s thought one must move beyond the vocabulary of\ntwentieth-century political dispute. \n\nIn his first book, Experience and Its Modes (1933, cited as\nEM), Oakeshott barely mentions politics. But this does not\nmean that he was not interested in political philosophy when he wrote\nit. The book grew out of his Cambridge lectures from the late 1920s,\n“The Philosophical Approach to Politics”, now included in\nEarly Political Writings (Oakeshott 2010). In these lectures\nhe distinguishes different ways of thinking about politics, but in the\nbook these different ways of thinking are detached from the subject of\npolitics and presented as general modes of experience. By the time he\nwrote Experience and Its Modes, Oakeshott had come to believe\nthat political philosophy was necessarily defective—that it was\nlimited by its commitment to a pre-philosophically demarcated sphere\nof experience and therefore not genuine philosophy. The book is a\nhighly individual performance in the style of British philosophical\nIdealism, written at a time when that approach to philosophy was\nrapidly going out of fashion. In it, Oakeshott credits the influence\nof Hegel, Bradley, and Bosanquet, but it was evident that he had\nabsorbed their views “into an insistent literary personality\nwhich moved freely and suggestively in many types of literature”\n(Cowling 2003: 256). When Oakeshott took up politics again in the late\n1930’s, it was in relation to the controversies of the day. At\nthe urging of the Cambridge political scientist Ernest Barker, and\npartly motivated by the hope it would gain him a professorship, he\ncompiled an anthology of texts expounding the “doctrines”\nof contemporary Europe: Representative Democracy, Catholicism,\nCommunism, Fascism, and National Socialism (Oakeshott 1939). His first\npostwar publication was an edition of Hobbes’s\nLeviathan, with an influential introduction later published\ntogether with other essays on Hobbes in Hobbes on Civil\nAssociation (Oakeshott 1975b). In 1947 he founded the\nCambridge Journal, a short-lived but critically esteemed\nvehicle treating politics and culture as topics for civilized\nconversation rather than ideological polemics or academic\nresearch. Several of the essays reprinted in Rationalism in\nPolitics first appeared there. \n\nOakeshott’s magnum opus, On Human Conduct (1975a, cited\nas OHC) appeared late in his career. It was greeted in some\nquarters with incomprehension and in others with hostility, but mostly\nwith silence. Even those who judged the book important found its style\nforbidding, and its impact has been muted. Also difficult are the\nthree late essays on the philosophy of history included in On\nHistory and Other Essays (1983, cited as OH). His essays\non the idea of liberal education and its practical implications,\ncollected in The Voice of Liberal Learning (1989, cited as\nVLL), are more accessible and continue to receive attention\n(Williams 2007; Backhurst and Fairfield 2016). After Oakeshott’s\ndeath other writings appeared, first in a series of volumes published\nby Yale University Press (Oakeshott 1993a, 1993b, and 1996) and then\nin a series from Imprint Academic (Oakeshott 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008,\n2010, and 2014). There has also been a steady stream of secondary\nworks, including two companion volumes (Franco and Marsh 2012;\nPodoksik 2012). Comparison with philosophical\ncontemporaries—Collingwood, Wittgenstein, Schmitt, Strauss,\nHayek, Gadamer, Arendt, Foucault, MacIntyre—offers another angle\nfrom which to view his place in twentieth-century thought (Dyzenhaus\nand Poole 2015; Plotica 2015; N. O’Sullivan 2017). This\nliterature, together with the attention his less accessible writings\nare starting to receive, suggests that Oakeshott occupies an\nincreasingly secure place in the history of philosophy and political\nthought. \n\nPhilosophers have used the word “mode” to refer to an\nattribute that a thing can possess or the form a substance can\ntake. For Oakeshott, this thing or substance is experience, by which\nhe means both the activity of experiencing and what is experienced,\nunderstood as inseparable and therefore as a unity. Looked at from\neither side, experience involves thinking and therefore ideas. He has\nin mind the kind of mutually correlated subject-object relationship\nthat Hegel examines in the Phenomenology (which Oakeshott\nread in his 20s), according to which what is experienced—the\nobject—is itself thought. Where a body of ideas has achieved a\nsubstantial degree of integrity and differentiation, a mode of thought\ncan be said to have emerged. Sometimes, a mode is understood to be an\naspect of something larger or more real than itself (Descartes 1641:\n27–28, 31). In Experience and Its Modes there are\ntraces of the view, also discernible in Spinoza and Hegel, that this\n“larger thing” is everything that exists, the sum total of\nexperience identified as God or the Absolute. Oakeshott does not use\nthe word “mode” in later writings in a way that postulates\na universal or ultimate reality. But neither is a mode of thought just\nany kind of thinking. It is an “autonomous” kind of\nthinking, one that is “specifiable in terms of exact\nconditions” and “logically incapable of denying or\nconfirming the conclusions of any other mode” (OH 2). A\nmode constitutes a distinct and self-consistent “whole of\ninterlocking meanings” (VLL 38), a world of ideas\nresting on its own criteria of truth, factuality, and reality. A\npuzzle, then, is how the modes can talk to one another, and the\nsolution is that as modes they don't. There is a difference between\nthe modes as ideal types and their instantiation in actual thoughts\nand actions, and therefore between philosophically differentiating\nthem and investigating them historically or sociologically.   \n\nThinking that is involved in acting is one such mode, which Oakeshott\ncalls “practice”. Another is “history”, by\nwhich he means neither “the notional grand total of all that has\never happened” nor some part of it, whose makers are the\nparticipants in the occurrences that constitute it, but rather a\ndistinct kind of inquiry into and understanding of events. Because\nevents are not given but must be inferred from what the historian\ntreats as evidence, history is made by the historian (OH\n1–2). It is, moreover, an inquiry that aims to account for past\nevents as intelligible outcomes of antecedent events. In contrast to\nhistory, understood in this way, “science” as a mode is\ndefined by its search for regularities that can account for the\noccurrence of repeatable events and for ways to express these\nregularities as relationships between quantities. This way of\ndistinguishing between history and science locates Oakeshott in the\ntradition of German Neo-Kantian of the previous generation, Windelband\nand Rickert especially, in which the Naturwissenschaften and\nGeisteswissenschaften were treated as distinct\nepistemological forms. History and science are both inherently\nexplanatory, but the kinds of explanations they provide are\ndifferent. Genuine history is also distinguished from ideas about the\npast that are shaped by current practical concerns (the\n“practical past”). The same holds for science: as a mode\nof inquiry, science is different from the practical application of\nscientific knowledge. From this perspective, we might see engineering\nas a practical discipline rather than a scientific one.  \n\nModes, then, are distinct and provisionally coherent kinds of\nknowledge. In Experience and Its Modes, Oakeshott aims to\nidentify the presuppositions in terms of which a mode can be made\ncoherent and distinguished from other modes. Modal distinctions are\ncategorial. A categorial distinction is one of kind rather than\ndegree. Philosophers have disagreed about whether the identified kinds\nare natural (ontological) or conceptual (epistemological): the former\nare categories of being (Aristotle), the latter categories of\nunderstanding (Kant). Philosophers have also disagreed about whether a\ncategorial scheme must be exhaustive and fixed or, alternatively, can\nbe open and mutable. The modes that Oakeshott identifies in\nExperience and Its Modes—history, science, and\npractice, to which he later added “poetry” (aesthetic\nexperience)—can from one angle be seen as epistemological\ncategories, not ontological ones. But from another angle the\ndistinction between being and knowing does not make sense\n(Hegel). There can be no absolute difference between what a thing is\nand how it is conceived in a particular context because there are no\n“things in themselves” in the Kantian sense that are\nindependent of thought. And though the modes are mutually exclusive,\nOakeshott does not think that they form a closed set. The modes he\nidentifies are intellectual constructions that have appeared in the\ncourse of human experience. This suggests that they could change or\neven disappear, and that new modes might emerge. But here we must\ndistinguish between a mode and its instantiation. History was a\npossible form of thinking before anyone started to think historically\nand would remain a possibility even if human beings were to cease\nthinking historically.  \n\nA number of other conclusions follow from this understanding of\nmodality. First, a mode of experience implies a distinct and\nautonomous kind of understanding. It implies a universe of discourse\nwith its own arguments and ways of assessing and grounding\nthem. Because propositions in one mode of discourse have no standing\nin another, truth is coherence, however defined, within a given\nmode. To argue across a modal boundary is to commit the fallacy of\nignoratio elenchi (irrelevance). If there is any relationship\nbetween the modes it is conversational, not argumentative: cross-modal\nencounters yield differences, not supra-modal conclusions. Oakeshott\nsometimes makes this point by speaking of modes as\n“voices” in an inter-modal conversation (RP\n488–491, 497). In conversation the rules of relevance are\nrelaxed: a conversation is not an argument. Second, because what\ncounts as rational in discourse depends on the mode of discourse\nitself, there is no extra-modal definition of reason or\nrationality. The illusion that there is arises from privileging what\ncounts as reasonable within a given mode and denigrating what is\nconsidered reasonable in other modes. This illusion of superiority\ngenerates the narrowness, and at times hubris, characteristic of each\nmode connoted by the labels “historicism”,\n“scientism”, “pragmatism”, and\n“aestheticism”. A conversational as opposed to\nargumentative juxtaposition of modal voices is respectful of\ndifferences and for that reason inherently civilized, which means that\nto insist on the primacy of any single mode is not only boorish but\nbarbaric. And because the modes are independent of one another, and\nnone is more expressive of an imagined mode-independent reality than\nany other, there can be no hierarchy of modes. \n\nIn making these points, Oakeshott differs from philosophical Idealists\nin Germany, Italy, and England who were proposing similar categorial\nschemes around the same time. These include Benedetto Croce, who\ndistinguishes the theoretical modes of art, history, and philosophy\nfrom the practical modes of economics and ethics, and R.G.\nCollingwood, who in Speculum Mentis, an early work, begins\nwith Hegel’s triad of art, religion, and philosophy, identifying\nphilosophy broadly defined with “knowledge” and\ndistinguishing three kinds of knowledge—science, history, and\nphilosophy narrowly defined—to generate a fivefold hierarchy of\nmodes. In Collingwood’s scheme, art is at the bottom, followed\nby religion, the former concerned to imagine or “suppose”\nand the latter to “assert”, and then by the three kinds of\ngenuine knowledge, which are distinguished from art and religion in\nbeing critical. Philosophy proper is the most critical of all because\nit aims to transcend the other forms (Collingwood 1924; Connelly\n2015). Oakeshott, partly in response to Collingwood, folds art and\nreligion into practice, denies that modes can be ordered\nhierarchically, and defines philosophy as the activity of\ninterrogating presuppositions, including its own, and therefore not\nitself a mode. But despite characterizing philosophy as supramodal, he\nsevers the tie between philosophy and unqualified\nknowledge—“the Absolute”—that one finds in\nIdealist metaphysics from Hegel to Collingwood. The distinction\nbetween modal thinking and philosophy that Oakeshott asserts in\nExperience and Its Modes reappears in On Human\nConduct as a distinction between “conditional” and\n“unconditional” theorizing, the former resting on\nassumptions that the latter questions.  \n\nThe idea of a hierarchy of modes is not particular to Idealism. Where\nthere are different understandings, someone interested in reconciling\nthem might argue that they represent different levels of\nunderstanding, some more inclusive and in that sense higher than\nothers. In contrast to unifying philosophies, including philosophical\nIdealism, Oakeshott’s position is pluralist and\nanti-hierarchical. In this respect he has more in common with Wilhelm\nDilthey, who struggled with the issue of relativity in metaphysics and\nhow to distinguish the human from the natural sciences, than with the\nBritish Idealists—Bradley, Bosanquet, and McTaggart among\nothers—with whom he is often associated (Boucher 2012). For\nOakeshott, all knowledge is conditional. Theorizing is “an\nengagement of arrivals and departures” in which “the\nnotion of an unconditional or definitive understanding may hover in\nthe background, but … has no part in the adventure”\n(OHC 2–3). In attempting to construct a coherent view\nof the world the philosopher “puts out to sea”\n(OHC 40) and is perpetually en voyage: there are no\n“final solutions” in philosophy any more than in practical\naffairs.  \n\nWhat Oakeshott calls “Rationalism” is the belief, in his\nview illusory, that there are “correct” answers to\npractical questions. It is the belief that an action or policy is\nrational only when it rests on knowledge whose truth can be\ndemonstrated. Its error is thinking that correct decisions can be made\nsimply by applying rules or calculating consequences. In an early\nessay, Oakeshott distinguishes between “technical” and\n“traditional” knowledge. Technical knowledge is knowledge,\nwhether of facts or rules, that is easily learned and applied, even by\nthose who are without experience. Traditional knowledge, in contrast,\nis “knowing how” rather than “knowing that”\n(Ryle 1949). It is acquired by engaging in an activity and involves\njudgment in handling facts or rules (RP\n12–17). Knowledge often involves an element of rule-following\nbut using rules skillfully or prudently means going beyond the\ninstructions they provide. Even a simple rule, like “no vehicles\nin the park” (Hart 1958), implies an element of judgment. This\nholds for collective as well as individual decisions and for political\nas well as private ones. But if technical knowledge has limits, so\ndoes traditional knowledge. We cannot conclude that experience and\njudgment are infallible: clearly, they are not.  \n\nPolitical deliberation occurs when a public decision needs to be made\nand a proposed course of action defended. But deciding which course of\naction to pursue involves more than simply applying rules or\ncalculating costs and benefits. It requires interpretation and\njudgment. We must decide which rule to use and then interpret what it\nmeans in a given situation. If, alternatively, we choose an action\nbased on its likely consequences, we must judge the expected value of\nthose consequences, and this involves making value judgments as well\nas estimating probabilities. Whether we are applying rules or\ncalculating outcomes, we must work with what we presume to be facts,\nthough these are always uncertain in various ways. For these reasons,\nthere is never a demonstrably correct course of action. Political\narguments cannot be proved or disproved; they can only be shown to be\nmore or less convincing than other such arguments. Political\ndiscourse, then, is a discourse of contingencies and conjectures, not\nof certainties or context-independent truths. It is persuasive and\nrhetorical, not a matter of demonstration or proof (RP\n70–95). \n\nThese are familiar points, made by Oakeshott with particular\nclarity. What he adds to other philosophical discussions of practical\nreasoning, such as Aristotle’s treatment of techne and\nphronēsis (Nichomachean Ethics 1142a) or\nKant’s remarks on judgment as the middle term between rules and\napplications (Kant 1793: 8:275), are reflections on how practical, and\nin particular political, discourse can cause disasters when these\npoints are overlooked. His conclusions rest on a dissection of\nideological politics, which, Oakeshott thought, reflects a\ncharacteristically modern disposition to substitute rules—which\ncan be moral, historical, scientific, or divine—for judgment in\npractical reasoning. The rules that are thought to govern practice are\nnot independent of practical activity but abstracted from it. They are\n“abridgments” of customs, habits, traditions, and skills\n(RP 121). To borrow language from Michael Walzer, they are\ninterpretations rather than discoveries or inventions (Walzer\n1987). And what they interpret are ways of doing things:  \nthe pedigree of every political ideology shows it to be the creature,\nnot of premeditation in advance of political activity, but of\nmeditation upon a manner of politics. (RP 51)   \nRationalists, unaware of the local origins of the universal\nprinciples that they imagine they have identified, reject knowledge\ngained through experience in favor of something they call reason or\nscience. Whether deductive or computational, this abstract reason is\nthought to guarantee greater certainty than experience and judgment\ncan provide. The fallacy of Rationalism, in other words, is that the\nknowledge that it identifies as rational is itself really a product of\nexperience and judgment. It consists of rules, methods, or techniques\nabstracted from practice—tools that, far from being substitutes\nfor experience and judgment, cannot be effectively used in their\nabsence. \nIn his essays on Rationalism, Oakeshott discusses many examples of\nideological politics. He dissects the rhetorical strategies of Locke,\nBentham, and Marx and takes contemporaries to task for thinking that\npolitical conclusions can be extracted from religious or scientific\nprinciples or from what are believed to be the lessons of\nhistory. Marxism, for example, claims that laws of historical change\ncan be discerned scientifically and practical guidance derived from\nthem. But the claim should be understood as a rhetorical one that can\npersuade only those who already believe it (Oakeshott 2008:\n168–177). In his Lectures in the History of Political\nThought (Oakeshott 2006: 469–482) and On Human\nConduct (OHC 263–316), he discusses the arguments\nof Francis Bacon, the German Cameralists, and others who impute some\ncollective purpose to the state as an enterprise for promoting some\nparticular substantive goal. This goal might be religious, economic,\nimperial, or therapeutic. Bacon, for example, argues that the purpose\nof government is to exploit nature, which implies mobilizing labor for\nthe sake of collective welfare—an implication explored and\ndeveloped by later thinkers, often but not only those identified as\nsocialist. The “collective” and “welfare”\nelements of this understanding of the modern state, like the more\ngeneral theme of exploiting nature for human ends, have become\nubiquitous. Oakeshott examines seventeenth-century Puritanism,\neighteenth-century enlightened despotism, and twentieth-century\nfascism and communism, all of which see the state as a corporate\nenterprise of some kind, as instances of what he calls\n“telocracy” (or “teleocracy”). In each case,\nthe collective goal is tied to an ideology that professes to offer\nguidance for how to achieve the goal.   \nThese explorations of ideological politics took Oakeshott in two\ndirections. One, discussed in Section 4 below, was to distinguish\nalternative understandings of the modern European state, each of which\ncould appear as either an analytical concept or an ideology. The other\nwas to affirm the independence of explanatory theorizing from\npractical engagement by questioning the commonly affirmed “unity\nof theory and practice”—an argument, discernible in\nHeidegger and Gadamer, American pragmatism, and Frankfurt School\ncritical theory, for the practical character of all knowledge (Neill\n2013). Heidegger treats practical experience not as one mode of\nunderstanding among others but as the primordial experience from which\nnothing human can free itself. For pragmatists from Peirce to Rorty,\nideas arise from our relationship to nature, which is how it affects\nus and our projects. For critical theorists, all theorizing is\ndetermined by the practical concerns that motivate it and is therefore\nimplicitly if not explicitly prescriptive. Even philosophy is\npractical, at least when it deals with ethics and politics, for those\nwho offer practical guidance under the labels of normative or applied\nethics. Moral philosophy, they argue, aims primarily to judge and\nguide conduct and only secondarily and instrumentally to understand\nit. A similar point is made about political philosophy. \n\nOakeshott worked hard to rebut the argument that political philosophy\nis inherently and unavoidably practical. Not only is it possible to\ndistinguish political philosophy from its object, political activity,\nbut its claim to being philosophical demands that the distinction be\nrecognized. In Oakeshott’s view, moral philosophy properly\nso-called is theorizing about morality (metaethics). It is concerned\nto understand and explain, not to prescribe. Prescriptive or normative\nethics, he argued early on, is “pseudo-philosophy”\n(EM 331–346) because it mixes theorizing with\nmoralising. Just as a theory of jokes is not itself a joke\n(OHC 10), a theory of morality is not itself a morality. The\nobject of theorizing is a “going-on” to be reflected upon\n(“theorized”) by an observer (a “theorist”)\nwhose reflections may generate conclusions (“theorems”),\nhowever provisional (Oakeshott 2004: 391; OHC 3). Theorizing\nis distinguished from what Oakeshott calls “doing” in that\nthe product of theorizing is an understanding, a theorem or\nproposition, not, as in the case of doing, an action. In doing,\nwhatever reflection takes place involves deliberating about what to\ndo. The theorizing that distinguishes genuine historical and\nscientific inquiry from pseudo-history or pseudo-science is not\naction-oriented and prescriptive but explanatory. What distinguishes\nphilosophical from historical or scientific inquiry is that philosophy\nis more critical in examining the presuppositions of inquiry: where\nscientists or historians want to get on with their work, the\nphilosopher is concerned to problematize that work and to examine the\nexperience of thinking itself. Political philosophy, then, is properly\nphilosophical when it examines the presuppositions of political\nactivity.  \n\nAn objection to distinguishing theory and practice in this way is that\nit treats as categorial a distinction better understood as one of\ndegree. Political theory is messy. It involves describing and judging,\nexplaining and prescribing, and it is not always clear where one\nbegins and the other ends. They are certainly joined in\nOakeshott’s writings despite his arguments for keeping them\nseparate (Haddock 2005). But the objection affirms rather than denies\nthe distinction. This is not to say that it cannot be challenged, but\nto push the discussion further we must rethink the terms involved, for\nexample by defining practical reasoning as reasoning that results in\nchanges in belief as well as action (Wallace\n2020). Alternatively, we might treat the theory-practice distinction\nas contextual: a philosopher’s theoretical argument can appear\npractical when read historically as a move in some debate (Nardin\n2015: 318–319).  \n\nFor Oakeshott, philosophy is distinctive because it questions rather\nthan uses other kinds of knowledge. Theorizing politics is therefore\nnot the same as engaging in politics, and to the extent that\ntheorizing is itself political it loses its distinctive character. The\nirony of critical theory is that there must be things of which it is\nuncritical in order to do what it purports to do: one cannot question\nand act at the same time. The contribution of political philosophy,\nfor Oakeshott, is not to generate ideologies or recommend policies but\nto understand political activity in terms of its assumptions. The\nknowledge it generates, moreover,\n\nis always provisional. Because scientific or historical knowledge is also provisional, this might seem to blur the distinction between philosophy and other kinds of inquiry. But philosophy is distinguished by its relentlessness in questioning presuppositions: it is an inquiry  \nin which questions are asked not in order to be answered but so that\nthey may themselves be interrogated with respect to their conditions.\n(OHC 11)   \nTo embrace this activity is to escape the prison of one’s\ncurrent understanding. For the philosopher, it means leaving politics\nand even political philosophy behind to pursue other concerns. This is\nnot intended as a description of what political philosophers do (they\ndo many things) nor a prescription for how they should proceed; it is\nthe product of Oakeshott’s reflections on his own experience in\nmoving from engaging political arguments to uncovering their\npresuppositions. \n\nFor the study of politics to be genuinely philosophical, Oakeshott\nthought, it must exchange the vocabulary of political activity for one\nthat explains politics in other terms—different terms from those\nto be explained. But this can lead to misunderstanding because the\nvocabularies are not interchangeable. The need to escape the shackles\nof an inherited political vocabulary explains why, in On Human\nConduct especially, Oakeshott modifies that vocabulary to\ndistinguish the kind of association he calls “civil” from\nassociation to promote a substantive purpose, “enterprise”\nassociation. If we apply the idea of enterprise association to the\nstate, we necessarily generate a conception of it as a corporate\nundertaking. Civil association, in contrast, implies a state whose\nlaws leave citizens free to pursue their own self-chosen purposes: a\nstate premised on the independence of those associated and therefore\ncommitted to resisting the domination that occurs in private life when\nsome impose their preferences on others and in public affairs when the\nstate itself is organized to impose a collective purpose on\neveryone. For this to work there must be limits to the pursuit of\nindividual purposes, and in civil association these are understood as\nlimits that enjoin respect for the freedom of all. Oakeshott’s\nLatinate terminology—civitas for state, cives\nfor citizens, lex for law, jus for the rightness of\nlaw, and respublica for the common good—springs from\nhis wish to direct the reader away from the conventional connotations\nof the English words by using words less closely identified with the\nconcerns of enterprise association that pervade modern politics and\ntherefore modern political discourse. Civitas is a mode of\nassociation in which cives are related to one another as\nfellow subjects of common laws and in which the laws based are\nnoninstrumental. \n\nAn obvious objection to this view is that a state needs instrumental\nas well as noninstrumental laws; no state can function without issuing\norders and framing policies to secure compliance, raise revenue,\ndefend itself against enemies, and so forth. Oakeshott would not\ndisagree. Any actual state is a mixture of formal and substantive\nelements, procedures and policies, civil and enterprise\nassociation. But defining civil association does not mean identifying\nthe features of an actual state; it means identifying the\n“postulates” of civil association as a mode of\nassociation. These are attributes of a state that determine its civil\ncharacter and distinguish it from states in which that character is\nrecessive or even suppressed, as in a despotism. Cives are\nunited in their recognition of the authority of lex and of\nthe obligations it prescribes. The law identified as lex\nconstrains citizens in the same way that Hobbes said hedges constrain\ntravelers: keeping them on the roads without prescribing their\ndestinations (Leviathan, ch. 30). To say that the laws in a\ncivitas are authoritative is to say that their recognition as\nlaw is independent of whether cives approve of the\nobligations they prescribe. Similarly, to consider the desirability of\na law in civil association is to engage in an activity narrowly\nfocused on the question of whether that law is an appropriate\nexpression of respublica, conceived not as a substantive\ngood, interest, or purpose but as rules, procedures, and offices\ngoverning the conduct of the associates (OHC 147–149):\nthis is the res publica, the “public concern”,\nwhich is the proper subject for political deliberation in civil\nassociation. In an actual state, however, the public concern includes\nsubstantive goods that follow from or are needed to sustain the rule\nof law, for it is the rule of law that defines the civil\ncondition. These goods, as Kant and others have observed, might\ninclude policing, roads, schools, hospitals, and social security\n(Ripstein 2009: chs. 8 and 9). Civil laws do not violate the premises\nof civil association when they redress “public bads” such\nas poverty, epidemic disease, or air pollution (de Jongh\nforthcoming). There is, in short, ample room for welfare concerns\nwithin the civil condition, once the idea of civil association is\nbrought down to earth.  \n\nOakeshott considers the implications of a “civil”\nunderstanding of the modern state in many writings, but most\nsystematically in his essays “On the Civil Condition”\n(OHC Part II) and “The Rule of Law” (OH\n119–164). Underlying the theory of civil association that he\ndevelops in these works is a distinction between two modes of human\nrelationship, one moral and the other prudential. Laws in the mode of\ncivil association, which is an idea abstracted from what might be\ngoing on in an actual state, are noninstrumental rules enabling the\ncoexistence of independent wills, not instruments to advance a\ncollective purpose. Such laws are “moral”, in the sense\nthat they prescribe authoritative constraints on how individuals may\ngo about satisfying their wants, not prudential devices for achieving\nsubstantive satisfactions. In contrast to persons transacting or\ncooperating to satisfy wants, those who are related morally (in this\nsense of the term) are related on the basis of rules as rules:\nnoninstrumental standards of conduct whose authority is distinguished\nfrom their utility. One might question Oakeshott’s use of the\nword “moral” without disputing his suggestion that there\nis a distinction between the propriety of an act as judged by its\nrelationship to a rule and its consequential desirability. A moral\nrule binds people regardless of their purposes; it binds enemies as\nwell as friends. As a moral relationship, then, civil association\nunites people not as subjects compelled to pursue a collective goal\nbut as individuals pursuing goals of their own, subject to the\nconstraints of laws that are not the instruments of some larger\npurpose. \n\nLex is what Oakeshott calls an “ideal character”,\nan abstraction that is not to be confused with the actual law of any\nexisting state. To theorize civil association is not to describe the\ncontingent features of a particular state but to identify the\npresuppositions of the state as a mode of association. Having\nidentified the modes of civil and enterprise association, Oakeshott is\nable to distinguish a legal order organized to advance a substantive\npurpose, one shaped by laws instrumental to that end, from one in\nwhich the laws are noninstrumental constraints on the choices of\nsubjects pursuing their own purposes. Once we have grasped the\ndistinction, we can see why he identifies the rule of law with civil\nassociation: differentiating the rule of law from other kinds of legal\nrule is necessary to distinguish between laws premised on the\nindependence of citizens and laws designed to conscript them for\npurposes not their own and thereby to dominate them. For Oakeshott,\nthe rule of law is a concept, not a description of any existing legal\norder, much less (as it is for a less philosophical thinker like\nFriedrich Hayek) a guiding ideal or ideology. In what has been called\n“the ambiguity thesis” (Friedman 1989), Oakeshott holds\nthat any actual state—any existing legal order—is mixture\nof noninstrumental rules regulating interactions among citizens and\nrules instrumental to achieving substantive purposes: an ambiguous\ncombination of civil and enterprise association. \n\nThere will, then, be enterprise elements even in states in which the\ncivil character predominates. An actual state must have, in addition\nto rules of association, some way to recognize, alter, and apply those\nrules. Civil association, in other words, requires legislative and\njudicial institutions and an apparatus of “ruling”\n(policing, licensing, conscripting, and the like). Such institutions\nare needed to anchor the idea of civility in the real world. The\ngovernment of an actual state will occupy buildings, keep records, and\ncollect taxes. And as a necessary part of governing it will sometimes\npursue substantive policies, attempt to produce particular outcomes,\nissue specific orders or commands, and concern itself not only with\nclasses of persons but with named individuals. These powers can be,\nand often are, misused, but they must be available if the rule of law\nis to be more than “a logician’s dream” (OH\n149). But there is a difference between the conceptual presuppositions\nof civil association and the conditions for realizing it in the\ncircumstances of a particular state. In civil association the\npersona of the legislator, judge, or administrator is defined\nby the obligations of lex. A legislator is not an advocate\nfor policies. A judge is not an arbitrator between interests, nor is\nan administrator the implementer of a collective project. What is to\nbe legislated, adjudicated, and implemented is noninstrumental law,\nlex, not policies to advance the substantive purposes of a\nstate conceived as a corporate enterprise. In any actual state these\nroles—legislator and policymaker, judge and arbitrator, ruler\nand manager—may not be sharply distinguished. But in the mode of\ncivil association, they are distinct.   \n\nThere is also a difference between the authority of a law and its\ndesirability: a legal order that its subjects disapprove of might have\ndifficulty sustaining itself. The difference is conceptual as well as\npractical. Oakeshott joins legal positivists in distinguishing the\nvalidity of a law as law (which he calls its\n“authenticity”) from its desirability or justice (its\n“rightness”). But as his vocabulary signals, there are\nsubtle distinctions that he finds important. In a civil association, a\nlaw is authentic if it is the outcome of an authoritative procedure\nfor enacting or otherwise recognizing it as part of the legal\norder. This leaves open questions about its utility, moral legitimacy,\nconformity to some standard of fair distribution, or other qualities\nthat might bear on its desirability. For Oakeshott, the rightness of a\nlaw (or as he puts it, the jus of lex) is not a\nmatter of its consequences. He does not agree with John Rawls, Ronald\nDworkin, or other liberal egalitarians that the rightness of a law\n(which they call justice) depends on whether it fairly distributes\nbenefits and burdens (OH 156). Nor does he agree that it\ndepends on criteria that Lon Fuller (1969) calls the “inner\nmorality” of law, which requires among other things that laws be\npublic, general, and not retroactive. These are qualities not of\njustice but of legality, Oakeshott argues. A law that is secret,\ntailored to benefit or injure particular individuals, or designed to\npunish acts performed before its enactment is a disguised command, not\na genuine legal rule (OHC 128). He also disagrees with those\nwho think that a law’s rightness depends on its conformity with\na higher law, whether divine or natural, with principles of human\nrights, or with any other universal and categorical standard\n(OHC 174; OH 142).  \n\nOakeshott is less clear about what justice or rightness in civil\nassociation is than what it is not. He suggests that the most\nimportant consideration in assessing a law's rightness is whether the\nobligations it prescribes are appropriately imposed, in part because\nlaw is inherently coercive (OHC 160; OH 143). That\nan action is harmful, wrong, or otherwise undesirable is not\nnecessarily a decisive reason to forbid it legally. Whether a state\nshould constrain someone’s choices on such grounds depends on\nwhat Oakeshott calls the moral-legal self-understanding of a community\n(OH 160). If the criteria used in judging the justice of laws\nare not already embedded in the way a community deliberates legal\nchanges, what is called justice becomes an arbitrary standard that can\nundermine the rule of law. The defect here arises when we judge a\ncommunity’s laws according to abstract criteria unrelated to the\nself-understandings of its members. Here again, Oakeshott's view\nresembles that of Michael Walzer, who argues that appropriate and\neffective “social criticism” comes from those who are\nexperienced in the ways of the community they criticize: they are\n“connected critics” who base their criticism on the\ncommunity’s own standards. They stand “a little to the\nside, but not outside” the communities whose practices they\ncriticize (Walzer 1987: 61). The desirability of a law, then, must be\njudged in relation to the practices of the community. These are not\nunivocal, however, and so the judgments are a matter for continuing\ndebate. Judging well requires a disciplined focus on the obligations a\nstate can properly prescribe. A law might be found wanting, for\nexample, if enforcing it were to require intrusive surveillance. The\ncharacter of deliberation in a state bearing the character of a civil\nassociation is defined by its style more than by its conclusions in\nparticular cases (OH 161).  \nOakeshott’s idea of civil association responds to a\nfundamental question in political philosophy: how can the nonvoluntary\ncharacter of law be reconciled with individual freedom? And his\nanswer, which self-consciously restates conclusions reached by\nRousseau, Kant, and J.S. Mill, among others, is that law respects\nindividual freedom only when it is understood as limited to regulating\nthe activities of citizens pursuing purposes of their own. A legal\norder of this kind must ensure adequate compliance with its laws, but\ncoercion for that end should be distinguished from coercion designed\nto advance substantive policies unrelated to maintaining the civil\norder. The state as a framework of laws for the coexistence of free\nindividuals becomes a tyranny when law is used to impose the purposes\nof some on others who do not share them. The legal subject in an\nenterprise state is not an independent citizen but someone to be led,\nmanaged, mobilized, or provided for: a subordinate assigned a role in\na purposive project. The dependent role-players in an enterprise state\nand the independent individuals in a civil one are equally\n“free”, in one sense of that word, because both have\n“agency”, the capacity to choose even when their choices\nare constrained. But only in civil association do those associated\nenjoy “individual freedom”, which for Oakeshott means\nfreedom from being legally subjected to the purposes of others. \n\nThis is a version of the republican idea of freedom as independence or\nnondomination (Skinner 1998; Pettit 1997), though for Oakeshott as for\nKant independence is defined in moral rather than material terms and\nstripped of certain other elements of republican political thought,\nsuch as that the people must make its own laws. Individual freedom,\nwhich is distinct from the freedom inherent in agency, is not\ncompromised by law in civil association. One reason for this is that\nin civil association, as a mode of association, laws are\ngeneral rules, not particular commands. The more nearly a state\nresembles an enterprise association in practice, the less it can\naccommodate activities “eccentric or indifferent to its\npurpose” (OHC 316). Participating in a purposive\nenterprise can express individuality only if participation is freely\nchosen. The subjects of an enterprise state are not independent,\nbecause the purposes they are compelled to serve have been chosen for\nthem. And although some may contingently escape servitude, whether\nthey are permitted to go (or for that matter to stay) is a management\ndecision (OHC 317). Because individual freedom in enterprise\nassociation is the freedom to dissociate as well as to associate, it\ncan exist only if the association itself is voluntary, and this cannot\nbe assumed if the association is a state. \n\nOakeshott builds his account of civil association in On Human\nConduct on an exploration of its presuppositions. These include\nthe ideas of agency, agents, actions, transactions to satisfy wants,\ninstrumental and noninstrumental practices, and the conduct of agents\nrelated in terms of such transactions and practices. And he explores\nideas about the modern state in European thought and practice, a topic\nhe also discusses in other writings (Oakeshott 1993b, 1996, 2006,\n2008). He traces the distinction between civil and enterprise\nassociation to the medieval ideas of societas and\nuniversitas, terms he borrows (and redefines) for his\npurpose. Societas designates a relationship of agents in a\npractice (such as a common language), agents  \njoined not in seeking a common substantive satisfaction, but in virtue\nof their understanding and acknowledgement of the conditions of the\npractice concerned and of the relationships it entails. (OHC\n88)  \n\nA universitas, in contrast, is a corporate undertaking (such\nas a partnership or school) established to advance a particular\nend. Societas is not identical with civil association,\nhowever; it stands for a larger class of relationships based on the\nnoninstrumental considerations that define them. The civil condition\nemerges only when these considerations harden into rules\n(“laws”) and are supplemented with other rules for\nrecognizing, altering, and enforcing them. Oakeshott examines\nreflections on the modern state, so conceived, found in Machiavelli,\nMadison, Constant, and Montesquieu, among others, and more\nphilosophically (that is, in terms of its presuppositions rather than\nincidental features) in Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Kant, Fichte, and\nHegel. He also examines the ideas of thinkers who saw the state as a\npurposive enterprise. These include Francis Bacon, for whom the state\nwas a productive estate, Joseph de Maistre, who saw it as “a\nreligious corporation in the Catholic idiom” (OHC 281),\nand various theorists of enlightened despotism, socialism, national\nself-determination, and economic development. But Oakeshott’s\ndiscussion of these thinkers and their arguments is only loosely\nhistorical, inviting the charge that he is using them for his own\npurposes and in a way that does not meet his own standard of genuine\nhistorical inquiry. \n\nBy distinguishing between thinking to understand and thinking to act,\nOakeshott aims to protect historical, scientific, and philosophical\ninquiry from the imperialism of practical concerns. This aim is\nevident in his treatment of historical inquiry, especially in his\nconcern to distinguish the idea of a distinctively historical past\nfrom what he calls “the practical past”. Genuine\nhistorical inquiry is concerned to establish what happened, not to\nelicit knowledge that speaks to present concerns. It is indifferent to\n“the lessons of history” (EM 316) or “the\nliving past” (OH 19). His point is not that past\nexperience cannot guide, but that the past that is supposed to guide\nis not a “historical” past. Nor is it the business of\nhistorical inquiry to generate stories about the direction of\nhistory. Books about the progress of the human mind (Condorcet) or the\nend of history (Fukuyama) written from the standpoint of the\nauthor’s own time do not observe the modal conditions of\nhistorical thought but are instead works of what Herbert Butterfield\n(1931) called “Whig history”—history designed to\nratify, if not glorify, the present. A similar point can be made about\nstories of decline. By detaching historical knowledge from present\nconcerns, Oakeshott articulates a theory of history as a distinct mode\nof inquiry and understanding.  \n\nImplicit in these claims for the autonomy of historical inquiry is a\ndistinction between naturalistic and hermeneutic ways of understanding\nhuman affairs. Oakeshott uses the word “conduct” to\nidentify human choice and action, contrasting it with behavior\nexplained as the outcome of natural processes. Unlike natural\nphenomena, human conduct involves ideas. And unlike the natural\nsciences, the “human sciences”\n(Geisteswissenchaften, the sciences of mind as a body of\nideas) require interpreting ideas, especially those that shape\nintentional and self-conscious action. The human sciences are, in\nfact, doubly interpretive because they interpret human conduct, which\nis itself an activity that involves making and acting on\ninterpretations. And when they go beyond generalizing about human\nconduct to explaining particular acts, the explanations they provide\nare “historical” explanations.  \n\nIn making these points Oakeshott draws on late nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century German thinking about the study of history,\nespecially the anti-positivism of Windelband, Rickert, and\nDilthey. Their arguments rest on a distinction between the realms of\nhuman freedom and natural necessity articulated by Vico, Kant, and\nHegel, among others. Understanding human conduct in terms of thought\nand action can nevertheless be scientific—that is,\nsystematic—in its own manner. Such an inquiry might focus on\nwhat Hegel called “objective spirit”, shared ideas\nexpressed in languages, moral traditions, and other practices that\nrequire interpretation. But it might also focus on individual\nperformances: particular acts, ideas, judgments, arguments, and other\nproducts of thinking. In either case, the disciplines of the\nhumanities and humanistic social sciences are concerned with the\ncontent of thinking—ideas—not the natural processes that\nmake thinking possible (VLL 23–24). This claim is at\nodds with how the social sciences are widely understood and especially\nwith much in the disciplines of psychology and cognitive science.   \nIf separating the social sciences from the humanities is a\nmistake, Oakeshott thinks, another is to imagine that the word\n“social” designates a subject for\ninvestigation. Sociology, he argues, is not a discipline with its own\nsubject matter; it is what remains when disciplines such as economics\nand psychology have claimed certain aspects of human activity as their\nown. The study of a residual category cannot be a genuine discipline,\nnor is there any general science of society that grounds the\nconclusions of economics, psychology, and the other social\nsciences. What are loosely called social relationships are actually\nrelationships in terms of specific practices—habits, customs,\nrules, and roles—that prescribe considerations of utility or\npropriety in acting. They are not, as Oakeshott thought sociologists\nwere inclined to assume,  \ncomponents of an unspecified, unconditional interdependence or\n“social” relationship, something called a\n“society” or “Society”. (VLL 24)  \nThis is not a point about nomenclature but a claim that a proper\ndiscipline has boundaries that enable a coherent inquiry. For\nOakeshott, the category that defines coherent inquiry into human\nconduct is not “social” but\n“intelligent”. Intelligence, here, is not the quality of\nbeing bright or stupid but of having agency, the capacity to think and\nchoose. An excavated object is either a manifestation of intelligence\n(an inscribed tablet) or not (a rock). In making this distinction, he\nis not suggesting that the experienced world is made up of two kinds\nof things but rather that we experience the world differently\naccording to the categories of understanding that we bring to it. For\nan understanding to be coherent, it must distinguish between the\nintelligent and the not-intelligent because these categories are\nmutually exclusive. Propositions about the biochemistry of thinking\ncannot explain the cognitive content of a person’s thoughts. No\ninquiry can generate a self-consistent body of knowledge if its\nobjects are categorially ambiguous. These claims restate\nOakeshott’s point that cross-modal arguments are necessarily\nincoherent. Much of social science is undermined by efforts to\nunderstand intelligent conduct as the product of not-intelligent\nphysiological, psychological, or social processes seen as natural,\nthat is, operating independently of understanding. Such efforts cannot\ngenerate genuine knowledge because they involve a categorial\nerror. Coherent explanation is impossible when  \nrules are misidentified as regularities, intelligent winks as\nphysiological blinks, conduct as “behavior” and contingent\nrelationships as causal or systematic connections. (VLL\n26)  \nThoughts and actions can be explained, but only historically, not\nscientifically. Oakeshott is here deliberately breaking with the view\nthat explanations are always “causal” explanations that\ninvoke scientific laws. Historical explanations presuppose a\ndistinctively historical conception of causation. An argument, choice,\nor judgment made by a particular agent at a particular moment is an\nindividual performance, an event. Scientific psychology can generalize\nabout how people are likely to act but it cannot explain particular\nchoices, which may fail to illustrate the generalizations. And the\nreason for this limitation is not only the categorial impossibility of\nexplaining meanings in terms of statistical patterns or natural\nprocesses but also the gap between observed generalizations and\nparticular acts. The generalizations about human nature or social\nconditions found, confirmed, and relied upon by social scientists,\nthough often illuminating, cannot explain the occurrence of particular\nacts, which viewed as intelligent human conduct are always\nperformances in relation to some practice. The social sciences aim to\nfind causal relationships between variables such as age or income, and\nto offer explanations in terms of these relationships rather than\nintelligent choice. Such explanations are possible, but what they\nexplain is variance in the data, not particular performances.   \nExplaining particular acts, Oakeshott argues, is\n“historical” explanation, which as he understands it is\ncategorially distinct from scientific explanation. An observed pattern\nin the data, a statistical generalization, identifies a type of\naction. A performance, in contrast, is the choice of an actual agent\nat a particular moment. Science as a generalizing mode of inquiry aims\nto explain types of events, not particular occurrences. The humanities\nand humanistic social sciences, in contrast, are concerned with\nparticular acts or other individual objects. The individuality of an\nact is explained historically by relating it to antecedent events that\nled to its occurrence as an act with its particular\ncharacteristics. An individual act is one in a series of acts, each of\nwhich has meaning in relation to acts that preceded it. It is these\nantecedent acts, or some of them, that illuminate its unique\ncharacter. Only explanations of this kind are properly historical,\nOakeshott argues.   \nThis account of historical explanation departs sharply from a\npositivist theory like the covering law model (Hempel 1942; Nagel\n1961) because it holds that a historical explanation aims to explain\nnot just the occurrence of an event but its cognitive significance,\nwhich Oakeshott calls its “character”. Unlike scientific\nexplanations, which postulate repeatable events, historical\nexplanations postulate events that are individual and\nunique. Positivist theories of historical explanation get things\nbackward by assuming that the event to be explained is already\nunderstood as an instance of a type of event, but the historian cannot\nmake this assumption. Historical inquiry is not an exercise in\nexplaining an event whose character is known in advance of the effort\nto explain it. This character has yet to be established, and it can be\nestablished only by showing how antecedent events led to it rather\nthan some other event. The relationship between an antecedent and a\nsubsequent event is a “contingent” one in which the\nmeaning of the subsequent is illuminated by the antecedent.  \nOakeshott’s conclusion that history is central to the human\nsciences results from reflection on the limitations of the natural and\nsocial sciences in explaining individual performances. Scholars in the\nhumanities and humanistic social sciences typically interpret such\nperformances in relation to historical practices such as religious\nceremonies, musical genres, culinary traditions, or legal procedures,\neach of which may be understood as a “language” of human\nperformance. But the understanding thereby gained is incomplete,\nOakeshott argues, because what it reveals is not the individuality of\na performance but rather its “conventionality” (OHC\n99–100), the type of conduct it illustrates. As explanation,\nthis kind of interpretation help to understand contexts, situations,\nand types of action (practices), but it cannot explain the occurrence\nof particular acts (performances): why a particular person did such\nand such a thing on this or that occasion. \n\nGiven Oakeshott's view of the importance of history among the human\nsciences, the sustained attention that he devoted to it is not\nsurprising. History is the first mode he considers in Experience\nand its Modes and he returns to the topic often in later\nwritings. History as a mode of thought is not a record of past events\nbut a distinct way of identifying and explaining them. The task of the\nphilosophy of history, as Oakeshott sees it, is to clarify what\ndistinguishes historical from other kinds of inquiry. Historical\ninvestigation cannot simply record historical events because what is\nidentified as an event depends on evidence, and what counts as\nevidence must itself be established. The point, fundamental to the\nmodern discipline of critical history, was made in 1852 by Gustav\nDroysen, who argued that  \nthe data for historical investigation are not past things, for these\nhave disappeared, but things which are still present here and now,\nwhether recollections of what was done, or remnants of things that\nhave existed and of events that have occurred. (Droysen 1893: 11)  \n\nThe historian begins not with the past itself but with survivals from\nthe past that need to be authenticated and interpreted before they can\nbe used as evidence. A historical fact is not simply given. It is a\nconclusion: not “what really happened” but “what the\nevidence obliges us to believe” (EM 112). We identify\nas historical facts the conclusions that our investigations best\nsupport. The task of historical inquiry is to establish historical\nknowledge, according to the canons of the historian’s craft,\nfrom evidence that is always scattered, unreliable, and open to\ninterpretation. \n\nHistorical knowledge, as Oakeshott sees it, can therefore be said to\nbe constructed. The ideas (“identities”) that the\nhistorian uses to organize an inquiry—the Renaissance, India,\nthe Dreyfus affair—are designated, not discovered. And they are\nchanging, not immutable, identities that dissolve under scrutiny into\ncollections of events, which are themselves identities. They are not\ngivens but organizing ideas that are themselves open to\nreconsideration. Historical explanation means illuminating the\ncircumstantial meaning of an event in relation to its antecedents,\nwhich in a genuinely historical inquiry are always events and never\nscientific laws or processes. In a historical explanation, an event to\nbe explained is made intelligible as the outcome of what the evidence\nsuggests are the relevant antecedents. In this theory, which Oakeshott\ndevelops in the second of three late essays on historical inquiry\n(OH 45–96), a particular historical past appears as a\ncollection of contingently related events, often presented as a\nstory. But not necessarily: he disagrees with the view, which was\ngaining adherents at the time he was writing, that what distinguishes\nhistorical from other kinds of explanations is that they take the form\nof a narrative (Ankersmit 1983; Danto 2007). Historians do frequently\nconstruct narratives, but a narrative is not the only way to present\nhistorical knowledge.   \nIf historical knowledge is a construction, it follows that what we\nidentify as the past is actually present because it is what the\nevidence supports now. Historical facts are present because all facts\nare present, that is, exist as conclusions within a present body of\nknowledge. A historical past is constructed according to what present\nevidence—an object, such as an axe, diary, painting, or coin,\nthat has survived and is treated as evidence—compels the\nhistorian to believe. Nor is this historical past the only possible\nkind of past: if there is a historical past then there must be other,\nnon-historical, pasts constructed in modes other than the historical\n(OH 9). Of these, Oakeshott is particularly concerned with what he\ncalls the practical past because of the difficulty of distinguishing\nit from a past resulting from historical inquiry:   \neven the most severely “historical” concern with the\npast is still liable to be compromised by seeking the answer to\nquestions which are not historical questions and by asides and even\njudgments which belong to some other mode of understanding. (OH\n118) \n\nA scientific past, such as what happened during the first three\nminutes of the existence of our universe, must also be distinguished\nfrom the historical past. Cosmologists might learn something about\nthis past by running their equations backward, but historians have no\nequations to run.   \nWhat is distinctive about Oakeshott’s conception of\nhistorical inquiry can be brought out by comparing it with\nR.G. Collingwood’s claim that the historian’s proper task\nis to reenact the past (Collingwood 1993 [1946]: 282–302). That\nclaim makes historical truth subjective by requiring that the\nhistorian reconstruct past events as they were experienced by those\nwho participated in them. But this privileges the understandings of\nthe participants, who may not have understood or even known what was\nhappening. Their ideas are important in constructing a past but are\nnot everything we need to know to understand it. To argue otherwise is\nto argue that the historian is barred from having any ideas about a\ngiven past that “would have been impossible for anyone who lived\nin that past” (Oakeshott 2008: 49). Oakeshott also rejects\nCollingwood’s claim that “all philosophy is the philosophy\nof history” (Collingwood 1993 [1926]: 425) because it makes\nphilosophy, and by implication all knowledge, subservient to\nhistorical knowledge (Oakeshott 2007: 199). Collingwood’s\nargument for the primacy of history (historicism) is as reductionist\nas arguments for the primacy of science (scientism) or practice\n(pragmatism). The argument that one kind of understanding is the\nfoundation of other kinds assumes the truth of what it sets out to\nprove. Historical inquiry constructs knowledge from what it concludes\nto be evidence. It does not provide knowledge of a given, pre-modal\nreality. If historical pasts are intellectual constructions, there is\nno access to these pasts except through historical inquiry.","contact.mail":"twnardin@me.com","contact.domain":"me.com"}]
