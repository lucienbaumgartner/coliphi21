His status in French literature today is based\nprimarily on the posthumous publication of a notebook in which he\ndrafted or recorded ideas for a planned defence of Christianity, the\nPensées de M. Pascal sur la religion et sur quelques autres\nsujets (1670). Nonetheless, his philosophical commitments can be gleaned from\nhis contributions to scientific and theological debates in\nFrance in the mid-seventeenth century.\n\n\n\nPascal was born in Clermont (now Clermont-Ferrand), France, on 19 June 1623, and died\nthirty-nine years later in Paris (19 August 1662). Following his\nmother's death when he was three years old, Blaise was reared by his\nfather, Étienne, in the company of his two sisters, Gilberte\n(b. 1620) and Jacqueline (b. 1625). Later, in Paris, the family hired\na maid named Louise Delfault, who became effectively a member of the\nclose-knit family. Pascal's father was an accomplished mathematician,\nand he provided the only formal education that his son enjoyed. As\nCarraud (1992: Chapter 2) shows, this arrangement was unique in the\nseventeenth century for a young man of Pascal's social status. He was\nnever trained in theology or the philosophy of the schools, and his\nexclusively domestic education focused initially on classical\nlanguages and mathematics. The decision to educate Pascal at home was\nmotivated by the fact that he suffered from very poor health for most\nof his life, beginning at the age of two. Although his sister,\nGilberte, may have exaggerated in her hagiographical biography, La\nvie de M. Pascal, she reported Pascal as claiming that\n“from the age of eighteen, he never passed a day without\npain” (I, 67: all references to Pascal's works are to Pascal,\n1998/2000, with volume and page number). He continued to be so ill\nthat, at the age of twenty-four, he could tolerate no food other than\nin liquid form, which his sisters or his nurse warmed and fed to him\ndrop by drop (Vie: I, 69).  Gilberte's biography also\nconfirms that, as his sisters matured, they assumed many of the\nnursing responsibilities for their infirm brother that would otherwise\nhave been provided by his mother had she not died prematurely. \n\nThe Pascal family moved residence frequently, for political and\nfinancial reasons. They transferred initially to Paris in November\n1631, although Étienne was forced to return seven years later to\nhis original home in what had meantime become Clermont-Ferrand, because he\nexpressed public dissent about the crown's fiscal policies.\nFrance had declared war on Spain in 1635, and this\nintermittent campaign lasted for most of Blaise Pascal's life.\nThe international and local political context in which Pascal lived, together\nwith very public disputes between competing religious and theological\ntraditions in which he participated, helped determine the issues to\nwhich he contributed philosophical comments in the 1640s and 1650s.\nFor example, following the revolt of the Nu-Pieds in Normandy in July 1639,\nPascal's father was awarded a new post as a tax collector in\nRouen, to which he moved in 1639; his son, Blaise, followed in 1640. While still\nin Paris, he had written the short Essai pour les coniques\n(1640) and, despite his youth, had been introduced to the Mersenne circle by\nhis father as a promising young mathematician. Later at Rouen he developed\nthe first prototype of his calculating machine (1645), and began to\nexperiment with mercury barometers. Pascal's introduction to\nbarometric experiments occurred by chance when the royal engineer,\nPierre Petit (1598–1667), passed through Rouen in September 1646\nand informed both Pascals, father and son, about Evangelista Torricelli's\nexperiments in Italy. Pascal performed experiments with mercury\nbarometers initially in Rouen and Paris, and published\nExpériences nouvelles touchant la vide in 1647. Since\nhe was too ill to do so himself, he arranged for his brother-in-law,\nFlorin Périer, to conduct on his behalf one of the most famous\nexperiments of the scientific revolution on the puy-de-Dôme, in\nthe Auvergne. \n\nPérier arranged for two similar barometric tubes to be\nfilled with mercury, on 19 September 1648. He left one at the bottom of\nthe mountain, and charged a local friar to keep watch during the day\nand note any changes in the height of the mercury. Together with other\nwitnesses, Périer climbed the mountain and took readings of the\nheight of the mercury on the mountain top, and subsequently at two\nintermediate places on their return journey down the mountainside. As\nexpected, the height of the mercury column varied inversely with the height\n(above sea-level) at which the measurements were taken. When the\nexperimenters rejoined the friar at the bottom of the mountain and\ncompared the measurements on both tubes, they concurred exactly. The\nfriar reported that, throughout the day, there had been no variation in\nthe height of the mercury column that he observed, “despite the\nfact that the weather was very changeable, sometimes calm, sometimes\nrainy, sometimes very foggy and sometimes windy” (I, 433).\nThe results of this experiment were published as Récit de la\ngrande expérience de l'équilibre des liqueurs\n(1648). Pascal concluded, mistakenly, that the experiment guaranteed his\ninterpretation of its results [see below, Section 4]. \n\nPascal's initial encounter with Jansenism had occurred when he was\ntwenty-two years old. His father slipped on ice and dislocated or\nbroke his thigh in January 1646. Following the accident, the Deschamps\nbrothers, who had bone-setting and nursing skills, came to live in the\nPascal household at Rouen for three months. They introduced the family\nto the strict observance of Christianity inspired by the Dutch\ntheologian, Cornelius Jansen (1585–1638), and the French\ntheologian, Jean Duvergier de Hauranne, who is more commonly known as\nthe Abbé de Saint-Cyran (1581–1643). The evangelical work\nof the Deschamps brothers relied partly on Jansen's short treatise,\nthe Discours sur la réformation le l'homme\nintérieur, which was based on the text of I John 2:16:\n“For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh\nand the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not\nof the Father but is of this world.” Jansen taught that a desire\nfor knowledge was one form of concupiscence, and he argued that from\nthis “illness … arises the investigation of nature's\nsecrets (which are irrelevant to us), knowledge of which is useless,\nand which men do not wish to know except for the sake of knowing\nthem” (Jansen 2004: 24). Jansen recommended that Christians\nshould turn aside from the pride and concupiscence of human knowledge\nand scientific investigations, and that they should concentrate\nexclusively on knowledge of God. While this encounter with Jansenist\ntheology is sometimes described as Pascal's first conversion, it is\nunlikely that he had already made the definitive choice about the\ninsignificance of mathematical and scientific work that characterised\nhis change of heart in the 1650s. He returned to Paris with his\nsister, Jacqueline, in 1647. Descartes met him there, in September\n1647, during an extended trip to Paris from his\nusual residence in the north of Holland, and discussed with Pascal the\nresults they might expect if they conducted the kind of experiment\nthat was subsequently performed on the puy-de-Dôme. \n\nThe Pascal family (Étienne, Blaise, and Jacqueline) left Paris\nagain during the civil war known as the Fronde (1648), and they\nreturned later that year to a new address in the French capital. The\nsettlement agreed by Mazarin and the regent with\nthe parlement to end the Fronde meant that Étienne had\nbecome redundant as a tax-collector in Rouen. The return to Paris was\nfollowed within a few years by a radical change in the emotional and\nnursing support that Blaise Pascal had enjoyed since his earliest\nyears. His older sister Gilberte had married Florin Périer in\nJune 1641 and had moved to Clermont-Ferrand. However, his younger\nsister, Jacqueline, who had continued to act as his personal\nassistant, expressed a desire, in May 1648, to become a nun. She\nwanted to enter the Port-Royal convent in Paris, which was under the\nspiritual supervision of Jansenists and in which one of Arnauld's\nsisters was a prominent Abbess. Étienne's opposition caused\nJacqueline to defer implementing her decision as long as he was still\nalive. However, four months after her father's death in 1651, and\ndespite her brother's opposition, Jacqueline Pascal joined\nPort-Royal. Then, for the first time in his life, Blaise Pascal was\nalone and still in poor health. He soon began to accept spiritual\nguidance from his sister Jacqueline and subsequently from a prominent\nJansenist, Antoine Singlin (1607–64). \n\nIn the summer of 1654, Pascal returned briefly to mathematics in\ncorrespondence with Pierre Fermat (1601–65) about calculating\nprobabilities associated with gambling. He summarized his findings in\nthe\nTraité du triangle arithmétique which, like\nmuch of his other work, remained unpublished until after his death. In\nfact, as Edwards explains (Hammond, 2003: Chapter 3), Pascal's\ncontribution to probability theory was not recognised until it was\nused by Bernoulli in the early eighteenth century. \n\nDuring the night of 23 November 1654, Pascal had a dreamlike or\necstatic experience which he interpreted as a religious conversion. He\nwrote a summary of the experience in a brief document entitled\nthe Memorial, which he sewed into his coat and carried with\nhim until his death eight years later. The intensity of this\nexperience resulted in a definitive change in Pascal's lifestyle, in\nhis intellectual interests, and in his personal ambitions. After 1654,\nhe terminated the mathematical discussions about which he had\ncorrespondended with Fermat, and he cancelled plans to publish a\nbooklet on the vacuum that was ready to go into print. This booklet\nappeared posthumously as Traités de l'équilibre des\nliqueurs et de la pesanteur de la masse de l'air (1663), with an\nintroduction by Florin Périer. Périer may have\nexaggerated the other-worldly attitude of his late brother-in-law,\nwhen he wrote that, for more than ten years before his death, Pascal\nwas aware of “the vanity and nothingness of all these types of\nknowledge, and that he had acquired such disgust for them that he\ncould hardly tolerate intelligent people devoting their time to them\nand speaking seriously about them” (I, 459). Pascal had entered\nthe final period of his life, which was dominated by religious\ncontroversy, continual illness, and loneliness. This was also the\nperiod in which he assumed the challenge of defending Arnauld and,\nmore generally, Jansenist theology in the Provincial\nLetters. \n\nAntoine Arnauld (1612–94) was a prominent theologian in the\nSorbonne, who was most famous for his defence of Jansenism in De la\nfréquente communion (1643). Following the condemnation by\nPope Innocent X (May 1653) of five propositions about grace that were\nallegedly found in Jansen's posthumously published book,\nAugustinus (1640), Arnauld was threatened with censure by the\nTheology Faculty at the Sorbonne. This provoked Pascal to write a\nseries of open letters, between January 1656 and March 1657, which were\npublished one by one under a pseudonym and became known as the\nProvincial Letters. They purported to inform someone living\noutside Paris (in the provinces) about the events that were newsworthy\nin theological debates at the Sorbonne and, more widely, in the\nCatholic Church in France. The Letters rely on satire and\nridicule as much as on logic or argument to persuade readers of the\njustice of Arnauld's cause and of the unsustainability of his critics'\nobjections. However, despite Pascal's efforts, Arnauld was expelled\nfrom the Sorbonne (February 1656). Those who lived at Port-Royal des\nChamps — another convent associated with Port-Royal, which was\noutside the city boundaries — agreed to leave voluntarily (March\n1656) under threat of forcible expulsion, and the convent was\neventually razed to the ground. The Provincial Letters are\nPascal's deeply personal, angry response to the use of political power\nand church censure to decide what he considered to be a matter of\nfact, and to what he perceived as the undue influence of a lax,\nsecular Jesuit morality on those who held political and ecclesiastical\npower in France. The Jesuits were not members of the Sorbonne and were\nnot officially involved in Arnauld's censure; it is not immediately\nclear, therefore, why Pascal, in the course of writing the letters,\ndevoted so much energy to criticizing the Jesuits. He may have blamed\ntheir influence in Rome and their political connections with the\nmonarchy in France for Arnauld's censure. \n\nThe final years of Pascal's life were devoted to religious\ncontroversy, to the extent that his increasingly poor health\npermitted. During this period, he began to collect ideas and to draft\nnotes for a book in defence of the Catholic faith. While his health\nand premature death partly explain his failure to realise that\nambition, one might also suspect that an inherent contradiction in the\nproject's design would have made its implementation\nimpossible. Apologetic treatises in support of Christianity\ntraditionally used reasons to support\nreligious faith (e.g. a proof of God's existence, or historical\narguments to show the credibility of witnesses whose evidence is\nreported in the New Testament); however, according to Pascal's radical\ntheological position, it was impossible in principle to acquire or\nsupport genuine religious faith by reason, because genuine religious\nfaith was a pure gift from God. Pascal had collected his notes into\nbundles or liasses before he died, and had provided tentative\ntitles for each bundle; however, these notes gave no indication of the\norder in which they should be read, either within a given bundle or\neven between various bundles, and subsequent editors failed to agree\non any numbering system for the posthumously published notes. The most\nfrequently quoted modern editions of\nthe Pensées—those of Lafuma, Sellier, or Le\nGuern—provide concordances to the numbering systems adopted by\nalternative editions. Given the status of the Pensées\nas a posthumously published notebook, it also remains unclear whether\nPascal endorsed the opinions that are recorded there, or whether he\nplanned to use some of them merely for comment or critique. They are\nreliably attributed to Pascal only when he expressed similar views\nelsewhere. One of the most famous and most extensive notes in\nthe Pensées (Fragment 397: II, 676–81) is the\nso-called ‘wager’ in favour of belief in God. \n\nCole (1995, Chapter 15) argues that Pascal exhibited signs of manic\ndepression and an almost infantile dependence on his family in his\nmature years. In addition, many of the reported details of his\npersonal life suggest a fundamentalist interpretation of religious\nbelief that is difficult to reconcile with the critical reflection\nthat defines philosophy as a discipline. For example, his\nsister's Life recorded that Pascal had an almost obsessive\nrepugnance to any expression of emotional attachment, which Gilberte\nattributed to his high regard for the virtue of modesty. She reports\nthat “he could not even tolerate the caresses that I received\nfrom my own children” (I, 83).  Pascal believed uncritically\nthat God performs miracles, among which he included the occasion when\nhis niece was cured of a serious eye condition and the cure was\nattributed to what was believed to be a thorn from the passion of\nChrist. In general, Pascal's commitment to Jansenism was unqualified,\nalthough he denied in the Provincial Letters that he was a\nmember of Port-Royal (I, 781). Everything we know about Pascal during\nhis maturity points to a single-minded, unwavering belief in the\nexclusive truth of a radical theological position that left no\nroom for alternative religious perspectives, either\nwithin Christianity or outside it. This is not to suggest that it is\nimpossible to be a religious believer and a philosopher; there are too\nmany obvious counterexamples to such a suggestion. However, the\nintensity of Pascal's religious faith, following his conversion, seems\nto have made philosophical inquiries irrelevant to him, with the\nresult that he approached all questions during the final ten years of\nhis life almost exclusively from the perspective of his religious\nfaith. It was this perspective that predominated in\nthe Pensées. \n\nThere is a complementary reason for urging caution about reading\nPascal as a philosopher. He wrote much but published little, none of\nwhich was philosophy in the sense in which that term is used\ntoday [see section 6]. Apart from his brief essays on the vacuum and\nthe Provincial Letters, all his writings were edited and\namended posthumously by collaborators who were still involved in the\ntheological controversies that had dominated Pascal's later life. For\nexample, he seems to have contributed to an early version of the\nPort-Royal Logic (Arnauld and Nicole, 1993) that was subsequently\npublished in 1662; and the\nEntretien avec M. de Sacy was composed many years after his\ndeath, based on the recollections of an editor. Thus philosophical\nopinions that were attributed to him in various writings that he left\nonly in draft versions should be read with caution, because they were\npublished posthumously by partisan proponents of Jansenism rather than\ntheir original author.  His apparent disenchantment with philosophical\nstudies is reflected in Fragment 77 of the Pensées:\n“we do not believe the whole of philosophy to be worth one\nhour's effort” (II, 566). This may also testify to the extreme\nill-health and loneliness he experienced in his final years, when he\nreported that he could find consolation for his misery only in\nreligion. \n\nPascal was never employed in any capacity, and he lived modestly with\nthe financial support provided by his family. He died in the care of\nhis sister, Gilberte, and was buried in the church of Saint\nÉtienne du Mont, in Paris. His younger sister, Jacqueline, had\npredeceased him at the Port-Royal convent in October 1661. \n\nPascal's philosophical reflections are dominated by a theological\ninterpretation of the human condition that he claimed to have borrowed\nfrom Saint Augustine. On this view, Adam's fall from grace resulted in\na human nature that is essentially corrupt, and there is no\npossibility of recovery by natural means or human effort.  This\ntheological perspective determined Pascal's views about human freedom,\nand about ethics and politics; it also set extra-philosophical limits\nto his theory of knowledge, and prompted the negative assessment that\nhe adopted, during the final years of his life, of the value of\nscientific or mathematical research. \n\nFollowing Augustine, Pascal emphasized the extent to which any\nrecovery from the fallen state of human nature was a gift from God,\nwhich could not be earned or deserved in any way by human agents. This\ndivine gift included, as one of its elements, religious faith itself,\nthat is, the capacity of humans to believe the theological\ninterpretation on which the implied worldview depended. Other\nphilosophical commentators on Christian belief in the seventeenth\ncentury, such as John Locke or John Toland, argued that what a\nChristian is invited to believe must be intelligible; according to\nthem, there were no mysteries in Christianity if that term includes\npropositions that we cannot understand. Thus religious faith merely\ncompensated for a lack of evidence in support of a particular\nproposition, and made it possible for a Christian to accept it as true\n(Clarke, 2011). For Pascal, however, faith provides appropriately\ndisposed Christians with a means to transcend the limits of what is\nintelligible and to accept as true even matters that they cannot\nunderstand. To claim otherwise would be to set limits to the reality\nof God and to reduce religious faith to the compass of human\nunderstanding. The Pensées suggest: “if one\nsubmits everything to reason, our religion will contain nothing that\nis mysterious or supernatural” (Fragment 162: II, 602). Thus\nthose who are given the gift of genuine religious faith are expected\nnot only to accept things that are uncertain but, especially, to\naccede to realities that are incomprehensible. Pascal offered no\nexplanation of how this was possible. \n\nThis degree of incomprehensibility in the content of religious belief\nis consistent with a corresponding relativism about the competing\nclaims of different religious traditions. For example, each religion\nor each Christian sect might be understood as an alternative and\nequally uncertain perspective on the transcendent. However, Pascal was\nas committed to the exclusive truth of Catholicism, and even to his\npreferred interpretation of that tradition, as he was unwavering in\nhis belief in mysteries. “I see several inconsistent religions,\nall of which except one are false. Each one wishes to be believed on\nthe basis of its own authority and threatens unbelievers. I therefore\ndo not believe them for that reason” (Fragment 184: II,\n608). For Pascal, the Roman Catholic Church was the only true church,\n“outside of which I am fully convinced there is no\nsalvation” (Provincial Letters: I, 781). \n\nIn contrast therefore with many of his contemporaries in France, such\nas Descartes or Malebranche, Pascal also rejected the suggestion that\none could prove the existence of God by rational arguments. “The\nmetaphysical proofs … have little value” (Fragment 179:\nII, 605). A fortiori, he rejected the view adopted by Malebranche,\nthat we have no basis for believing the alleged content of revelation\nunless we have a prior proof that there exists a God who is capable of\ncommunicating with us. For Pascal, reason was completely inadequate to\nthe task of relating to a transcendent divinity, and the only way to\nGod was by ‘faith’. \n\nThus the discussion of wagering in favour of religious belief in the\nPensées (Fragment 397: II, 676–81), which Pascal\ndrafted and revised a number of times, was written from the\nperspective of someone who already believed in God, and who assumed\nthat their belief was itself a gift from God. Pascal had independently\nstudied the mathematics of gambling, and while considering how to\ncompose an apology or defence of Christianity, he reviewed ways in\nwhich a committed Christian might adapt the logic of wagering to show\nthat their belief is not unreasonable. However, according to Pascal's\ndeepest theological convictions, nothing that he wrote in this context\ncould persuade an unbeliever to become a believer in any sense that\ncould lead to salvation. No one can communicate religious faith in\nPascal's sense to others by reasoning or wagering, nor can such faith\nbe self-induced by the same methods. For Pascal, a decision to believe\nGod's revelation (in the relevant sense of ‘believe’) is\nnot based on rational calculation nor, as indicated above, does it\npresuppose a philosophical argument in favour of God's existence. A\ncalculation of the probability of one's wager is logically posterior\nto belief, and it purports to show only that those who have accepted\ndivine grace and believed in God have made a wager that is not\nunreasonable. Why? Because the significance or value of the belief as\na means to eternal salvation would, if it were true, compensate for\nits relative implausibility. \n\nThe various kinds of divine assistance (or, in the language of\ntheology, grace) by which human beings may overcome their Fallen\ncondition were the subject of intense theological controversy in the\nseventeenth century. The Church had condemned as heretical the\nPelagian theory that human beings could achieve eternal salvation by\nthe use of their unaided, natural powers. Various opinions to the\neffect that they could make some independent contribution to this\nprocess were equally condemned as semi-Pelagian. These suggestions\nwere thought to deny or mitigate the exclusive efficacy of the\nIncarnation. Jansenism represented a starkly exclusive interpretation\nof how God's assistance enabled Fallen human beings to recover from\nthe effect of Original Sin by the influence of ‘efficacious\ngrace’. However, such a unilateral interpretation of God's\nintervention seemed to make human effort redundant. Pascal mocked the\nsuggestion that God assisted weak human beings by means of a\n‘sufficient grace’ which was not sufficient, and that this\ninsufficient grace required an independent contribution from human\nagents. “By sufficient grace you mean a grace that is not\nsufficient” (Provincial Letters: I, 601). In response\nto what he understood as various degrees of Pelagianism, Pascal\ndefended the theory that no human effort could\ncontribute to salvation, even as a partial cause, and that God's agency is\ncompletely efficacious if He chooses freely to assist undeserving\nsinners. \n\nThis controversy about the relative efficacy of God's grace\nwas most evident in the discussion of free will, and in Pascal's\naccount of how we come to know the truth about radically different\nkinds of reality, the natural and the supernatural. \n\nHow to reconcile the complementary agency of God and of natural causes\nwas a central metaphysical problem for those, in the seventeenth\ncentury, who accepted divine intervention in the natural world. One of\nthe solutions offered (for example, by Malebranche and La Forge) was\noccasionalism, which resulted in part from a recognition of God's\nomnipotence. Unless God's causality were understood as inadequately\nefficacious, occasionalists thought it was redundant to require a\nsupplementary causal activity on the part of natural phenomena or\nhuman agents in order to cause the effects that are attributed both to\nthem and to God's agency. Pascal's account of free will reflected this\ndilemma at the heart of human choice. His discussion owes much to that\nof Augustine (2010), On Free Choice. \n\nPascal was little concerned about the freedom of human choices that\nresult, for example, in deciding to read one book rather than another,\nor in analyses of what it means to claim that an agent could have\nchosen or done otherwise. The comprehensive concupiscence under which\nhuman nature struggled, according to Pascal's account of the Fall,\nimplied that what are usually called human ‘choices’ are\ndetermined by the dominant desires of each individual. That provided a\nnaturalistic theory of mundane human choices. The less mundane cases,\nwhich were the focus of Pascal's interest, include those where someone\n‘chooses’ to act morally or otherwise. According to the\nJansenist theory of grace, God intervenes in the lives of individuals\nand makes it possible for them to choose something that otherwise they\ncould not have chosen, namely, to act in a manner that is conducive to\nsalvation. If God's assistance is sufficient to guarantee the efficacy\nof a human choice, it would seem that the choice of a human agent is\ndetermined by God's greater power. On the other hand, if God's grace\nwere inefficacious, it would seem as if He provides inadequate\nassistance because He relies on natural human powers to exercise free\nwill and thereby to supply what is missing from divine grace. This\nlatter position was rejected by Pascal as heretical and\nsemi-Pelagian. \n\nPascal's solution was to endorse an interpretation of Augustine's\ntheory of grace, and to re-describe as ‘free’ the choice\nof a human will that is ‘infallibly’ motivated by God's\nefficacious grace. The Écrits sur la grâce, which was drafted at\nabout the same time as the\nProvincial Letters, summarizes the Augustinian position as\nfollows: God predestines some human beings for salvation and saves\nthem by “means that are certain and infallible” (II,\n262). There are also others to whom God gave graces “that would\nhave led them to salvation had they used them properly” (I,\n262), but He chose not to provide them with the ‘unique grace of\nperseverance’ without which it is impossible to be saved. By\ndefending the necessity of God's grace and its infallible efficacy,\nand by assuming that some people resist this divine assistance, Pascal\nwas forced by the logic of his position to endorse a theory of divine\npredestination. If God were to provide efficacious grace to each\nperson, they could not fail to be saved.  Therefore, if some are\ndamned, that must be because God has decided not to rescue them from\nthe Fallen condition into which they have been born as a result of\nAdam's sin. \n\nIt would be easy, philosophically, to accept the limitations of\nhuman powers on which this account is based as a theologically inspired\naccount of weakness of the will. However, it is difficult to see in\nwhat sense human choice is free when it is determined infallibly by a\ndivinely originated desire that the will of each individual, to whom it\nis granted, finds irresistible. For Pascal, one's choice of\nsalvation is free in the sense that it expresses one's strongest\ndesire; but the desire itself is communicated only to those who are\npredestined by God, and is such that the recipient is guaranteed to\nfollow it. \n\nPascal did not publish an explicit theory of knowledge or philosophy\nof science in any single text. One can infer from disparate\nworks—such as his essays on the vacuum (written during the late\n1640s), De l'esprit géométrique (1655), and\nthe Entretien avec M. de Sacy (published\nposthumously)—that he had conflicting intuitions about natural\nknowledge, although they all recognise the special role of religious\nbelief. The Provincial Letters provide a statement of his\ngeneral overview: “How do we learn the truth about facts?  That\nwill be from our eyes … which are the appropriate judges of\nfact, as reason is of natural and intelligible things, and the faith\nis of things that are supernatural and revealed” (I,\n810). ‘The faith’ is not simply any religious faith; it is\nthe specific kind of belief to which Roman Catholics had access as a\ngift from God. Apart from faith, which is directed to revealed truths\nand the supernatural world, Pascal identified ‘experience and\nreason’ (I, 454) as the only ways of acquiring knowledge of the\nnatural world. \n\nThe scientific and theological controversies in which Pascal became\ninvolved engaged him in epistemological disputes that were both\ncommonplace and unresolved in the seventeenth century. These included\nquestions about observations or experiments as sources of evidence,\nthe certainty or otherwise of various types of knowledge claim, and\nthe epistemic status of hypotheses that are constructed to explain\nnatural phenomena. \n\nPascal was sympathetic to the mild, comprehensive pyrrhonism that is\nfound in Montaigne: “Montaigne is incomparable … for\ndisabusing those who cling to their opinions and who believe that they\nhave found unshakeable truths in the sciences”\n(Entretien: II, 97). Despite this tendency towards\nscepticism, Pascal frequently expressed confidence in the certainty\nwith which we can know ‘matters of fact.’ For example, he\nargued in the Provincial Letters that “matters of fact\nare proved only by the senses” and that they are “easily\ndecided” (I, 812, 723). This was consistent with one of the main\nlines of argument in the Letters. Pascal's\ndefence of Arnauld hinged on the claim that the five propositions\ncondemned by the Pope as heretical did not occur in the text of\nAugustinus, and that this fact could be established easily by\ninspection, i.e. by reading the book. On questions of fact, therefore,\neven the Pope (who, Pascal accepted, was an authoritative teacher of\nrevealed truths) could be mistaken, and it is inappropriate to appeal\nto any authority apart from one's senses to decide a factual question:\n‘authority is useless in that context’ (Preface to\nthe Traité du vide: I, 452). The same kind of\ncertainty about experimental facts, he thought, should have resolved\nthe dispute about heliocentrisim that led to Galileo's house\narrest. “It was in vain” therefore that the Jesuits\n“obtained from Rome a decree against Galileo … That is\nnot what will prove that the earth does not move; and if one had\nunchanging observations that proved that the earth revolves, all the\nmen in the world could not stop it moving” (Provincial\nLetters: I, 813). \n\nEven if facts could be known with certainty by observation, Pascal\nconceded that it would require the use of reason to understand or\nexplain natural phenomena, and that “the secrets of nature are\nhidden” (Preface to the Traité du vide: I, 455).\nTo penetrate those secrets, one has to have recourse to hypotheses.\nPascal's account of how hypotheses are confirmed, and the degree of\ncertainty that one could claim for them, were ambivalent. When\nreflecting on the results of the puy-de-Dôme experiment, he\nargued against critics that not only had he established that the\nmercury rises in a barometer because of the weight of the air, but\nthat the empty space at the top of a barometric tube is a\nvacuum. Others (including Descartes) accepted the experimental\nresults, but disputed this interpretation of them. They agreed that\nmercury is supported in a barometer by the weight of the atmosphere;\nthey also argued, however, that the apparently empty space in a\nbarometric tube contains a subtle matter of some kind, that it has\nphysical properties (for example, a specific size, or the capacity to\nbe penetrated by light, etc.), and that their interpretation of the\napparent vacuum was as consistent as Pascal's with the experimental\nresults. \n\nPascal's analysis of arguments that originate from hypotheses seems to\nhave been borrowed from mathematics. He argued that there are three\ntypes of hypothesis. The negation of some hypotheses implies an absurd\nconsequence, and they must therefore be true. The affirmation of\nothers implies an absurdity, and these must be false. In a third\ncategory, if no absurd conclusion results from either the affirmation\nor negation of an hypothesis, one cannot draw any valid conclusion\nabout its truth. Logically, different assumptions may “lead to\nthe same conclusion, for everyone knows that truth is often concluded\nfrom falsehood” (Entretien: II, 90). When applied to\nexperimental situations, it meant that one could get apparently\nconfirming results from a poorly executed experiment or one that is\nbased on a mistaken hypothesis. Accordingly, even the phenomenal\nsuccess of the puy-de-Dôme experiment did not show conclusively\nthat Pascal was correct about the vacuum. On the other hand, Pascal\nimplicitly assumed that a negative experimental result would have\ndisconfirmed the hypothesis that his experiment was designed to test\nbecause, by analogy with the claim that ‘absurd’\nconsequences disconfirm mathematical hypotheses, he failed to realize\nthat scientific experiments test clusters of interconnected hypotheses\nrather than individual hypotheses. The Duhem-Quine thesis, as it is\nknown today, shows that negative experimental results may be\nattributed to any of the many hypotheses that are assumed in\nobservations or experiments, and that the certainty to which Pascal\naspired cannot be realized even when experimental results are\ninconsistent with expectations. \n\nThis analysis left unresolved the status of scientific hypotheses.\nDo hypotheses provide genuine knowledge, despite their uncertainty? Or\ndid Pascal anticipate the solution later adopted by Locke and restrict\ngenuine knowledge to two categories: (a) what is perceived, and (b)\nwhat is ‘demonstrated’? De l'esprit\ngéométrique adopts a foundationalist perspective on\nknowledge, in which ‘principles’ are first established and\nthe certainty of other knowledge-claims derives from that of the\nprinciples. Such logically interconnected principles and conclusions\nwere called ‘demonstrations’. Thus every demonstration\nrequires that one first identify “the evident principles that it\nrequires. For, if one does not guarantee the foundations, one cannot\nguarantee the building” (II, 175). One establishes the\ncertainty of propositions if they are “deducible by infallible\nand necessary logical steps from such axioms or principles, on the\ncertitude of which depends all the certitude of the consequences that\nare properly deduced from them” (letter to Father Noël: I,\n378). This invites the question: does physical science provide\ndemonstrations in this sense? Pascal limited\n‘demonstration’ to mathematics and ‘whatever imitates\nit’ (II, 180). At the same time, he seems to have believed that\nhis own physical investigations were sufficiently similar to\nmathematics that they amounted to demonstrated knowledge, and that\nexperiments or observations provided their foundational principles. \n\nAccordingly, Pascal's preface to the Traité du vide\n(1651) claims: “the experiments that provide us with an\nunderstanding of nature continually proliferate; and, since they are\nthe only principles of physics, their consequences proliferate\naccordingly” (I, 455). The certainty of experimental results\nbased on observation, their role as principles of a scientific\ndemonstration, and the facility with which natural philosophers could\nperform appropriate experiments or make relevant observations, led\nPascal to an optimistic interpretation of scientific progress. He\nclaimed that, when researchers work together, they “make\ncontinual progress in science in proportion as the world gets\nolder” (I, 456). This apparently bright future for physical\nsciences contrasted with the scientific failure of earlier natural\nphilosophers, “those timid people who did not dare to discover\nanything in physics” (Preface to the Traité du\nvide: I, 454) and is reflected in the comment in the\nPensées, Fragment 654: “To what extent have\ntelescopes revealed realities to us that did not exist for earlier\nphilosophers?” (II, 807). \n\nIn summary, Pascal adopted an interpretation of natural science that\nexaggerated both the ease with which the consequences of observations\nand experiments could be determined, and the simplicity of the logical\nlinks between theories or hypotheses and their apparently confirming\nor disconfirming evidence. \n\nIn contrast with all knowledge that is derived from experience and\nreason, Pascal identified ‘authority’ as the exclusive\nfoundation of religious belief. Authority depends on memory and is\npurely historical, because the objective is simply to find out what\nsomeone said or wrote. This applies ‘especially in\ntheology’ (Preface to the Traité du vide: I,\n452), a discipline which Pascal presents as if there could be no\ndispute about what is revealed in the scriptures or, more\nfundamentally, about whether a particular writing belongs among the\ncanonical texts. He could not have avoided noticing that there were\nmany religious traditions that claimed to report divine revelations,\nand that each in turn rested its claims on its own authority as a\nreliable witness to earlier historical events and their\ninterpretation. This was apparent even with Christianity and, within\nCatholicism, Pascal was familiar with decisions of church Councils\nthat determined which interpretations of its doctrinal history were\nacceptable and which were anathemized as heretical. Thus the history\nof churches was rife with disputes about how to identify the\nappropriate religious authorities. Since Pascal rejected the validity\nof rational arguments as a criterion for distinguishing between what\nwas authentic or otherwise in Christian belief, he had to rely\nultimately on a personal choice of what to believe about the\nsupernatural, and then to interpret that personal choice as if it were\ninspired by a special grace from God. \n\nIt seems evident that the circularity of Pascal's\nself-justification could be repeated, with appropriate changes, by\nequally committed members of other religious traditions. \n\nIn the discussion of what he described in the Provincial\nLetters as the ‘perniciously lax’ morality of the\nJesuits, Pascal classifies many human actions — such as\nhomicide, in cases where is it not justifiable as self-defence\n— as obviously immoral, and as widely recognised as such. He\ncharacterizes these immoral actions variously as contrary to the\n‘natural light’, to ‘common sense’ or the\n‘natural law.’ As Ferreyrolles (1984) shows, there are\nnumerous references in Pascal to a ‘law of\nnature’. However, Pascal does not argue that this natural law\ncan be discovered by reason, or that it acquires its obligatory force\nfrom human convention or contracts. The Jansenist interpretation of\nthe human condition implied that human nature is corrupt, and\ntherefore that reason is now an unreliable moral guide.  “There\nare undoubtedly natural laws, but our fine corrupted reason has\ncorrupted everything” (Fragment 56: II, 560). According to this\nview, God had provided reliable moral guidance to human beings in the\nprelapsarian state of nature, and some remnants of God's law continue\nto be reflected in Fallen nature. Natural law, therefore, is what\nremains of God's law in the state of concupiscence of human nature\nafter the Fall. There is thus no independent, philosophical account of\nmorality available in Pascal, apart from the law of God which is more\nor less dimly revealed. \n\nAccording to God's law, or those elements of it which survive\nin the widely held opinions of human beings all over the world, there\nare certain actions which are intrinsically evil or good. Our moral\nduties include not only the more familiar examples, such as the\nobligation to refrain from voluntary homicide; Pascal also quotes with\napproval from Cajetan that “we are obliged by justice to give\nalms from our surplus, to alleviate even the common necessities of the\npoor … those who are rich are merely stewards of their surplus,\nin order to give it to whoever they select from among those who are in\nneed” (Letters: I, 714). \n\nHaving assumed that there are objective moral obligations, Pascal\ndirects his critique, both in the Provincial Letters and in\nhis contributions to the Écrits des Curés de\nParis, to the claim, attributed to Jesuit casuists, that one can\nchange the moral character of actions by changing one's\nintention at the time of their performance. On this account, if an\nagent acts immorally while formally intending to act immorally,\nnothing can excuse the action in question. In all other cases,\nhowever, Pascal described Jesuit casuisty as teaching that it is\npossible to modify the moral character of an action by applying the\nmethod of “directing the intention, which consists in selecting\nsomething that is permitted as the objective of one's actions”\n(Letters: I, 649). This escape from moral responsibility\nrelies on the principle that “it is the intention which\ndetermines the [moral] quality of an action” (Letters:\nI, 679). \n\nThe claim that one could direct one's intention away from what is\notherwise a morally reprehensible action was consistent with the\ncasuists' defence of the doctrine of ‘probabilism’.  This\ndoctrine, to which Pascal also objected, meant that one may decide\nmoral issues according to any opinion which is said to be\n‘probable’, even if it is much less probable than\nalternative opinions. ‘Probable’ in this context had\nlittle to do with calculations of probability, but was defined as\n“everything that is approved by well-known authors”\n(Letters: I, 732). The limits of what was morally acceptable\nwere thus provided by examining the writings of approved authors and\nfinding the least demanding moral opinions available in the\nliterature. Pascal's satirical critique of Jesuit casuistry assumes,\nin contrast, that human actions have a moral character that is\nindependent of the private thoughts or intentions of the agent who\nperforms them, and that one cannot ameliorate them by\n‘intending’ results that differ from the actual effects or\nconsequences that follow naturally from a given action. In that sense,\nPascal's critique is an early version of a modern objection to the\nso-called ‘Principle of Double Effect.’ \n\nPascal's political theory was likewise dictated by his account\nof human concupiscence. According to Fragment 90 of the\nPensées, “concupiscence and force are the\nsources of all our actions. Concupiscence causes voluntary actions,\nand force causes those that are involuntary” (II, 570). Although\nthe state of nature before the Fall of Adam was capable of guiding\nhuman behaviour, human relations are now completely compromised by\nconcupiscence and by the exercise of power by one person over\nanother. One inevitable effect of this unwelcome subservience is that\nwe are coerced into obeying those who exercise political power over\nus, and this can be interpreted as punishment for our sinful\ncondition. This pessimistic interpretation of political power and its\na possible abuse coincided with that of Luther and\nCalvin. The Trois Discours sur la condition des grands\ndistinguishes between natural gifts or abilities, which vary from one\nindividual to another and may provide a basis for our esteem, and\nvariations in social status or political power, which result from\nhuman contingency and require only that we obey and salute those who\nhappen to be our superiors (II, 194–9). The natural equality of\nhuman beings that is implicit in this analysis, however, provides no\nbasis for any theory of justice which would justify opposition to an\nestablished civil society or government, no matter how tyrannical it\nmay be (Bove et al., 2007: pp. 295 ff). In fact, there is no\nindependent perspective available to corrupt human beings from which\none may query whether the laws of a country are just; they are just,\nby definition, simply because they are the laws. “Justice is\nwhat is established; thus all our established laws will necessarily be\naccepted as just without being examined, because they are\nestablished” (Fragment 545: II, 776). A more extreme expression\nof the same view, in the Pensées, is that\n“justice, like finery, is dictated by fashion” (Fragment\n57; II, 562). \n\nThis political conservatism, which was partly motivated by Pascal's\nexperience of wars and partly by his theory of corrupt human nature,\nis reflected in his claim that “the worst evil of all is civil\nwar” (Fragment 87: II, 569). In the\nProvincial Letters, he directs readers to the moral teaching\nof the Gospels to guide them in political action. “The Church\n… has always taught her children not to render evil for evil\n… to obey magistrates and superiors, even those who are unjust,\nbecause we must always respect in them the power of God who has set\nthem over us” (I, 744). This compulsory tolerance of the status\nquo, for the sake of the common good, did not preclude comparative\nassessments of the merits or otherwise of different political systems.\nHowever, even in such assessments, the criterion applied by Pascal\nremained narrowly and theologically focused on the extent to which\npolitical arrangements facilitated citizens in the performance of\ntheir primary duties to God. \n\nThe appropriate attitude of subjects or citizens to established\npolitical authorities that govern them was exemplified, acutely, in\nthe demand by the civil powers in Paris that even conscientiously\nobjecting Jansenists had to sign and obey the formulary which\ncondemned the five propositions allegedly found in Jansen's\nwork. Dissenters like Pascal were not required to assent, in\nconscience, to what they did not believe; but they were required to\nassent in their behaviour, and to obey their political and\necclesiastical superiors. Likewise, the subjects of Pascal's polity\nwere not required to esteem their political masters, nor to hold\nbeliefs about them as human beings which they did not believe were\ntrue. It was enough that they obey them, that they observe the laws in\ntheir behaviour, and that they offer them the public deference that\nwas appropriate to their status as God's representatives, worthy or\notherwise, on earth. \n\nWhile it would be anachronistic to describe Pascal as an\nexistentialist, one of the most prominent features of his work is the\nphilosophical reflection on the radical contingency of human affairs\nthat emerges especially in the final years of his life. He used these\nreflections to puncture the pride, arrogance, and self-love of those\nwho thought of themselves as superior to the vicissitudes of human\nlife. Oliver Cromwell provided a contemporary illustration by his fall\nfrom power as a result of a relatively trivial\nillness. “Cromwell would have ravaged the whole of Christendom;\nthe royal family was lost, and his own family was about to become\nall-powerful, except for a little grain of sand that lodged in his\nbladder. Even Rome was about to tremble beneath him. Once this little\npiece of stone became lodged there, he died, his family was disgraced,\npeace was established all round, and the king was restored”\n(Fragment 632: II, 799). Many of Pascal's intuitions about the\ncontingency of human existence were a commonplace in the period,\nespecially among Calvinist theologians (Rivet, 1651). They were\ninspired in part by a growing acceptance within cosmology of the\ninfinite extent of the universe and, in contrast, the relative brevity\nof human lives. They owed even more to a theological perspective that\nclaimed to represent human affairs from God's perspective, including\nthe absolute will by which He predestines individuals for salvation or\neternal perdition. Pascal's distinctive contribution was to capture\nsome of these insights in the elegant, pithy phrases that\ncharacterized the poetic style of the Pensées.\nFragment 104, for example, compares a human life to a ‘thinking\nreed.’ “It is not in space that I should search for my\ndignity, but in the control of my thoughts … The universe\ncomprehends me by space and engulfs me like a point; by means of\nthought, I comprehend it” (II, 574). \n\nOne could question the validity of considering the value of finite\nbeings from the naturalistic perspective of an infinite universe, or\neven the conceivability of a divine perspective that, even according\nto Pascal, is not naturally accessible to finite minds. Given his\nextremely poor health and the expressions of abandonment that emerge\nfrom his later writings, one cannot avoid considering whether Pascal's\nchoice of ‘wretchedness’ (la misère) as a\nsub-title for one group of ‘thoughts’ reflected his\npersonal experiences. “The greatness of human beings consists in\ntheir ability to know their wretchedness” (Fragment 105: II,\n574).  Pascal's rejection of any naturalistic explanation of the human\nmind or soul, his emphasis on dread of an unknown future (because,\naccording to his theology, we do not know whether we are saved or\ndamned), the apparent insignificance of human existence, and the\nexperience of being dominated by political and natural forces that far\nexceed our limited powers, strike a chord of recognition with some of\nthe existentialist writings that emerged in Europe following the\nSecond World War. This was philosophy in a different register. For\nthat reason, some commentators reject the suggestion that Pascal was\nnot a philosopher (Brun, 1992; Hunter, 2013). Rather than speculate\nabout matters that transcend the limited capacity of the human\nintellect, Pascal invites his readers to recognize the description of\nhis personal experiences as resonating with their own. While\nemphasizing the natural insignificance of individual human lives, he\ndid not conclude that human existence was absurd. He pointed instead,\nas Christian existentialists have done since, to a source of meaning\nthat would transcend the limitations of our thought. Access, however,\nwas strictly limited to those to whom God freely gave the gift of\nreligious faith, without any merit on the part of the recipient."}]
