He was an\nexperimental philosopher, unwilling to construct abstract theories to\nwhich his experimental results had to conform. “Our\nBoyle,” Oldenburg wrote to Spinoza, “is one of those who\nare distrustful enough of their reasoning to wish that the phenomena\nshould agree with it” (Hall & Hall 1965–1977, 2:38).\nBoyle, a champion of both the corpuscularian doctrine and the Baconian\nmethod of natural history, preferred to report the results of his\nexperiments, including negative results, and frequently lamented the\nfact that we lacked “histories” (collections of\nexperimental results and accurate observations) in various fields of\nscientific endeavour. He performed so many experiments that he was\nable, at one “time to loose … at once near five centuries\nof Experiments of my own” (BP 9:28). Nor was this an isolated\nloss; nonetheless the number, variety and scope of his experiments\nwere such that he carried on working and publishing with no particular\ndifficulty. “His books,” as Huygens remarked to Leibniz\nimmediately after Boyle’s death, “are full of\nexperiments” (Huygens 1888, 10:239). Moreover, experiments were\nexactly what he was interested in, he had a certain\nmissionary zeal in spreading the corpuscularian gospel, but he was not\nhimself interested in detailed system\n building,[1]\n a fact that was commonly noted. Leibniz told Huygens that he was\n“astonished” that Boyle “who has so many fine\nexperiments, [had] not come to some theory of chemistry after\nmeditating so long on them. Yet in his books, and for all the\nconsequences that he draws from his observations, he concludes only\nwhat we all know, that everything happens mechanically. He is perhaps\ntoo reserved. Excellent men should leave us even their conjectures;\nthey are wrong if they wish to give us only those truths that are\ncertain” (Leibniz to Huygens, Dec. 29, 1691, in Huygens 1888,\n10:228). Boyle was ahead of his time. In the next century\nd’Alembert wrote “the taste for systems … is today\nalmost entirely banished from works of merit … a writer among\nus who praised systems would have come too late”\n(d’Alembert 1751,\n 94).[2]\n \n\nBoyle was a corpuscularian, a term he employed to paper over the\ndifferences between believers in a vacuum, and believers in a plenum,\ngiven that both of them agreed that the explanation of natural\noccurrences should be solely in terms of particles of matter, their\nmotion and interaction. Boyle consistently refused to pronounce on the\nquestion of whether these minima naturalia should be\nconsidered atoms, in the strict sense of that term, or\n not.[3]\n \n\nEven a metaphysical non-corpuscularian such as Leibniz agreed with\nBoyle in practical terms. “However much I agree with the\nScholastics in this general and, so to speak, metaphysical explanation\nof the principles of bodies,” he wrote to Arnauld in July 1686,\n“I am as corpuscular as one can be in the explanation of\nparticular phenomena, and it is saying nothing to allege that they\nhave forms or qualities” (Gerhardt 1875, 2:58, trans. Mason\n1967).\n\n\nBoyle’s scientific range was wide. Besides his well known work\nin mechanics, medicine, hydrostatics (Chalmers 2017, chap. 8) and a\nwide variety of experiments with his vacuum pump, he was interested\nboth theoretically and practically in alchemy (see Principe 1998,\nClericuzio 2000, Newman and Principe 2002), where his interest seems\nto have been fueled more by his constant desire to acquire knowledge\nof God and the world than by any desire for riches. He\n“cultivated Chymistry with a disinterested mind,” seeking\nthe improvement of his own knowledge, “the gratifying\nthe Curious & the Industrious; and the Acquist of some\nuseful helps to make good & uncommon\n Medicins.”[4]\n As a corpuscularian he believed that transmutation was physically\npossible. As a person he believed that it actually occurred. He\nbelieved that in his own laboratory gold had been transmuted into a\n“baser metal” with a specific gravity about two thirds of\nthat of gold, and since he was, he said, more interested in the\nluciferous aspect of discovery than the lucriferous, he found the\nprocess equally interesting in either\n direction.[5]\n \n\nDuring the course of his life he sought constantly to improve the lot\nof humanity. He was interested in the improvement of agricultural\nmethods, in the possibility of extracting fresh water from salt, in\nthe improvement of medicines and medicinal practice, in the\npossibility of preserving food by vacuum packing, and in a number of\nother useful results, actual or potential, of experimental philosophy.\nHe viewed his theological interests and his work in natural philosophy\nas forming a seamless whole and constantly used results from the one\narea to enlighten matters in the other. (On the relation between\nscience and religion in Boyle’s thought see Hunter 2000.)\n\n\nConvinced that Christianity was the religion instituted by God, Boyle\nwas concerned that the Bible should be widely promulgated and he\ndevoted time and energy to having it translated into a variety of\nlanguages such as Irish, Turkish, and various native American\nlanguages. He viewed such conversion attempts as being on all fours\nwith his attempts to find more efficacious medicines for:\n\n\n\nTo convert Infidels to the Christian Religion is a work of great\nCharity and kindnes to men. I. In regard of the evills it frees them\nfrom, such as, (1) the gross errors and prejudices they had\nentertain’d before they were instructed in it. (2ly) The vices\nand polutions they securely liv’d in, before they receiv’d\nthe Gospel; some of which were unworthy of men as such;\nothers very prejudicial to humane society’s; and\nothers very mischievous to the vicious persons themselves;\nand others <againe> great hinderances to the discovery\nand reception of usefull and noble truths. (3ly) The unexpressible\nInfelicitys that attend the greatest part of such Infidels &\nwicked Persons, in the future state.\n\n\nII. The Christian Religion brings mankind diverse positive Benefits,\nsuch as are, more cleare and extensive knowledg of God, and divine\nthings; the Remission of Sins; the Favour of God; severall graces and\nvertues suitable to mens respective needs and conditions; and above\nall, a happy Immortality in the Life to come. (Boyle Papers [BP]\n5:73–4; BOA §3.7.4, p 301)\n\n\nRobert Boyle was born in Lismore, Ireland, on January 25, 1627. He was\nhis parents’ fourteenth, penultimate, child, and the last to\nsurvive to adulthood. Boyle was the youngest son and, after his sister\nMargaret died when he was 10, the youngest child of the family. Boyle\nspeaks fondly of his parents, but he could not have known them well.\nHis mother died in childbirth a few weeks after Boyle’s third\nbirthday, and he last saw his father just before he and his brother\nFrancis left for a continental tour when Boyle was twelve. \nLike many children Boyle had his share of near escapes from serious\ninjury as a child, but the time and Boyle being what they were he saw\nin each of them the hand of God. Michael Hunter has pointed out that\n“the spiritual autobiography, aimed at chronicling God’s\npurpose for the individual in question by recounting providential\nescapes, spiritual trials and conversion experiences,” was\n“a characteristic genre of autobiographical writing in\nseventeenth-century England” (Hunter 1994a, xx), and Nicolas\nCanny notes that “The invocation of providence as an explanation\nfor accidental or chance happenings in this life was so commonplace\namong sincere Protestants in the early seventeenth century that it had\ncome to be considered irreverent or profane not so to attribute\nthem” (Canny 1982, 28). But, though common enough, there is no\ndoubt that, in Boyle’s case at least, the protestations were\nsincere. He continued to believe in this divine attention, though in a\nmore intellectual realm, throughout his life. In 1663 he wrote, \nIn Geneva on his continental tour Boyle underwent what he clearly felt\nto be a conversion from nominal or at least unthinking Christianity to\ncommitted Christianity. One summer night, he “was suddenly waked\nin a Fright with such loud Claps of Thunder … & every clap\n… both preceded & attended with Flashes of lightning so\nnumerous … & so dazling, that [he] began to imagine\n… the Day of Judgment’s being come.” This led him\nto vow that “all further additions to his life shud be more\nReligiously & carefully employ’d.” Realizing the\ninefficacy of a promise exacted under duress, Boyle repeated the\nperformance under a serene and cloudless sky “so solemnly that\nfrom that Day he dated his Conversion; renewing now he was past\nDanger, the vow he had made whilst he fancy’d himselfe to be in\nit: that tho his Feare was (& he blush’t it was so) the\n… occasion of his Resolution of Amendment; yet at least he\nmight not owe his more deliberate consecration … of himselfe to\nPiety, to any less noble Motive then that of it’s owne\nExcellence” (BP 37:181r-v, Hunter 1994a, 16). \nThe promise seems never to have been broken, and indeed the later\nBoyle stressed the need to have an examined faith. He pointed\nout that “usually, such as are born in such a place, espouse the\nopinions true or false, that obtain there” (BW, 12:421, Birch\n1772, VI:712), indeed, “the greatest number of those that pass\nfor Christians, profess themselves such only because Christianity is\nthe religion of their Parents, or their Country, or their Prince, or\nthose that have been, or may be, their Benefactors; which is in effect\nto say, that they are Christians, but upon the same grounds that would\nhave made them Mahometans, if they had been born and bred in\nTurky” (BP 7:233, BOA §3.7.5, pp 301–2). Boyle felt\nthat more was required of the thinking believer. Locke agreed: often a\nchild’s notion of God does more “resemble the Opinion, and\nNotion of the Teacher, than represent the True God” (Essay,\n1.14.13). \nHard on the heels of Boyle’s enlightenment, doubts about his\nfaith began to trouble\n him,[8]\n and these “distracting Doubts of some of the Fundamentals of\nChristianity” continued: “never after did these fleeting\nClouds, cease now & then to darken … the clearest serenity\nof his quiet: which made him often say that Injections of this Nature\nwere such a Disease to his Faith as the Tooth-ach is to the Body; for\ntho it be not mortall, ‘tis very troublesome” (BP 37:182r,\nHunter 1994a, 17). \nLeaving Switzerland, Boyle, along with Marcombes and his brother\ncrossed the Alps and entered Italy in September 1641 where, in\nFlorence, he spent the winter. “In Italy he read over\nthe lives of the ancient philosophers with the utmost\nattention,” presumably in Diogenes Laertius, and “[t]he\nsect, which then struck him most, was that of the Stoics; and he tried\nhis proficiency in their philosophy, by enduring a long fit of the\ntooth-ach with great\n unconcernedness.”[9]\n Still in Italy he had (in the winter of 41–42) what seems to\nhave been one of the very few sexual encounters of his life. Writing\nabout himself in the third person as Philaretus (sometimes P., or\nFilaretus) he says: \nLeaving Italy Marcombes and the two boys found on arrival in\nMarseilles that the monies the Great Earl had been in the habit of\nsending were no longer to arrive and that, indeed, the last\nquarter’s payment had been held up by Cork’s London agent.\nMoreover, there was a letter from the Earl, unaware of the mischance\naffecting the quarterly payment, telling them that, as a result of the\nrebellion in Ireland, no more money was to be forthcoming: in the\n“dangerous and poore estate whereunto by gods providence”\nhe had been reduced, he had “with much difficulty gott together\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds by selling of plate,” but to pay\nMarcombes’ bills punctually as he had in the past “I am\nnoe waies able.” So he advised Marcombes to use the money to\nbring the two boys \nIn the event Francis decided to return to Ireland, arriving in time to\nfight in the Battle of Liscarrol (September 3, 1642), at which another\nBoyle brother, Lewis, was killed. Meanwhile Robert decided that his\nhealth and lack of money ruled out a return to Ireland, and his age\nmade soldiering in Holland an untempting and indeed implausible\n prospect.[10]\n He therefore decided to accept Marcombes’ offer of hospitality\nin Geneva, and did not make his way to England until the summer of\n1644. \nBefore leaving Geneva Boyle had a conversation with François\nPerreaud (1572–1657), who later wrote Démonographie,\nou traité des démons, which Boyle then arranged to\nhave translated into English by Peter du Moulin (the younger,\n1601–1684). In a letter prefixed to the English edition Boyle\nrecalled that “the conversation I had with that pious Author\nduring my stay at Geneva, and the present he was pleased to\nmake me of this Treatise before it was printed, in a place where I had\nopportunities to enquire both after the writer, and some passages of\nthe booke, did at length overcome in me (as to this narrative) all my\nsettled indisposedness to believe strange things.” (BW 1:15)\nAcceptance of at least the possibility of diabolic or angelic\nintervention was common among the intelligentsia in the second half of\nthe seventeenth century. Cudworth pointed out one expedient reason for\nthe belief: \nIn a manuscript draft (“Loose papers whence some things are to\nbe extracted for the Discourse of the causes of Atheism”) Boyle\nconsidered three objections that might be made against such a belief:\nthe implausibility of the standard means of bringing about such\nintervention; the unreliability of the witnesses; and the\nimpossibility of incorporeal beings interacting with matter. He agrees\nthat the first objection, “urg’d with great confidence,\nand not without much show of Reason” is a strong one, but\nsuggests that “we men understand very little of the nature,\ncustomes, & government of the Intelligent creatures of the\nspirituall world: and particularly what concernes the Falne Angells or\nbad Daemons. And therefore they being themselves invisible to us, and\ncapable of working in wayes that our sences cannot discerne; and being\nAgents of great craft & long experience; tis no wonder that many\nof their actions, thô never so pollytickly contrived &\ncarried on, should seem irrationall to us: who know so little of their\nparticular inclinations & designes, and the subtil & secret\nmethods in which they carry them on.” \nThe second objection he also accepts, though not wholly:\n“thô upon particular & cogent proofe I beleeve some of\nthem to be true … yet I reject or distrust far the greatest\npart, as not being soe attested.” The third he rejects as being\nsimply inconsistent, for the human soul is accepted as incorporeal,\nand it works (though we know not how) on matter (BP 2:105, BOA\n§3.5.21, pp 257–8). \nWhen Boyle arrived back in England in mid-1644 at the age of 17 he was\nquickly reunited with his sister Katherine who seems immediately to\nhave re-adopted the semi-maternal role she had no doubt often played\nafter the death of their mother. She was concerned in a variety of\nother ways to look after his welfare, both spiritual and worldly. She\nwas, for example, the immediate cause of his getting to know the\nmembers of the Hartlib\n circle.[12] \nAt this time Boyle settled in Stalbridge (on an estate left to him by\nhis father) and occupied himself mainly in writing or planning works\nin ethics and theology. Much of his time during the early part of this\nStalbridge period was spent in moral philosophy — “My\nEthics go very slowly on,” he wrote to his sister\nKatherine on March 30, 1646 (BC 1:34) — and there was at this\nstage no reason to think that he would become one of the great natural\nphilosophers of his time. (See further, Hunter 2009, chs. 4 and 5.) He\nalready approximated to the “lay-bishop” that Aubrey,\nquoting Anthony Walker, was later to find him to be. He was, in fact,\na serious, somewhat priggish young man, though he often gave signs of\nlight-heartedness both as a boy and in later life. After his death\nGilbert Burnet claimed that “As for Joy, he had indeed nothing\nof Frolick and Levity in him,” a judgement accepted by Steven\nShapin, but this fails to allow for the lighter moments that Boyle\nundoubtedly\n enjoyed.[13] \nAt Stalbridge, about 1649, Boyle began to be interested in\nexperimenting, but was hindered by the fact that he could not obtain a\nfurnace. Stalbridge was far enough away from tradespeople who could\nmake such an item and the furnaces Boyle ordered tended to arrive\n“crumbled into as many pieces, as we into sects,” leaving\nBoyle to attempt “such experiments, as the unfurnishedness of\nthe place, and the present distractedness of my mind, will permit\nme” (BC 1:50). \nBoyle was troubled throughout his life by the fragmentation of\nChristianity. Among “the giddy multitude … this\nmultiplicity of religions will end in none at all,” he wrote to\nJohn Mallet in\n 1652,[14]\n and at the very end of his life he expressed in his Will the wish\nthat the Boyle lecturers should, when “proveing the Christian\nReligion against notorious Infidels (viz), Theists, Pagans,\nJews and Mahometans, not [descend] lower to any Controversies that are\namong Christians\n themselves.”[15] \nEventually, however, a furnace did arrive, and Boyle found himself\n“so transported and bewitch’d [as to] fancy my Laboratory\na kind of Elysium … . I there forget my Standish and my Bookes\nand allmost all things” (Boyle to Katherine Ranelagh, Aug 31,\n1649, BC 1:83). \nBoyle was never a student at a university. Nor was he ever a fellow of\nan Oxford College, though that too has been claimed on his behalf\n(Dutton 1951, 20), but it was to Oxford that he removed after his time\nat Stalbridge, and it was there that his interest in natural\nphilosophy flowered. Before taking up residence in Oxford however he\npaid two lengthy visits to Ireland during the early 50s (for a year\nfrom June 1652, and then for eight months from Oct 1653), and it was\nfrom that “illiterate country” that he wrote to Clodius,\nprobably toward the end of his second Irish visit, in the spring of\n1654: \nIt was also during this period, no doubt in large part due to\nCromwell’s extremely harsh treatment of the Irish, that\nBoyle’s Irish properties were made secure and began returning\nrents to him, ultimately reaching almost £3000 p.a., Hooke told\nAubrey. The fact that Boyle’s friend Petty conducted the survey\non which the disposal of the lands was based can hardly have been to\nBoyle’s disadvantage. \nOn October 12, 1655, Katherine was in Oxford investigating the\nsuitability of possible lodgings for Boyle. He was to lodge with the\napothecary John Crosse, whom Birch felt worthy of mention because he\nhad “a great acquaintance with Dr. John\n Fell,”[17]\n and the question was, which was the best room for his purposes, and\nhow was it to be furnished? \nThe house in question stood on the site where the Shelley Memorial now\nstands, and his two rooms there seem to have served Boyle admirably,\nthough he later set up a retreat at Stanton St John’s, where he\ncould retire when the press of society grew too great in Oxford. \nIn Oxford Boyle’s tremendous output of works in philosophy,\ntheology, and experimental philosophy began. It was here that he\npublished New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring\nof Air and its Effects, Certain Physiological Essays, The Sceptical\nChymist, Some Considerations touching the Usefulness of Experimental\nNatural Philosophy, and a number of others including The\nOrigine of Forms and Qualities. \nBoyle’s years in London (from 1668 to his death) saw the\ncontinuation of his experimental work, along with a number of works on\nphilosophy and theology, including The Excellency of Theology,\nCompar’d with Natural Philosophy, Considerations About\nthe Excellency and Grounds of the Mechanical Hypothesis, the\nFree Enquiry into the Vulgarly Receiv’d Notion of\nNature, the Discourse of things above Reason, Disquisition\nabout the Final Causes of Natural Things, and The Christian\nVirtuoso. \nIn 1691 Katherine died, and Boyle, whose health throughout his life\nhad been poor, died the following week. \nThe seventeenth century is notable not only for the number but also\nfor the variety of arguments which were offered to prove God’s\nexistence. Although writers such as Pascal and Bayle felt such\narguments to be both unnecessary and unavailable, demonstrations of\nGod’s existence were felt by many to be not only possible but\ndesirable, since they were necessary in the fight against\n atheism.[18]\n Descartes, as is well known, felt that God’s existence could\nbe, and epistemologically had to be, demonstrated, and offered a\nvariety of proofs to provide such a demonstration. His version of the\nontological argument, his proof from the supposed innate idea of God,\nhis proof from the need for an eternal conscious\n being,[19]\n and his proof from the need for continuing creation, all found\nsupporters in the later seventeenth century, though the first two were\ngenerally held to be unlikely to convince anyone. \nApart from a brief reference to it in the printed works Boyle does not\nmention the ontological argument (BW 9:413; Boyle 1772,\n4:461–2). This distancing was not uncommon at the time. Ralph\nCudworth, though clearly fascinated by the ontological argument,\nrecognized that most would “Distrust, the Firmness and\nSolidity of such thin and Subtle\nCobwebs,” and offered an alternative argument in the\nhope that it would prove more “Convictive of the\nExistence of a God to the Generality” (Cudworth 1678,\n725). \nThe language of the ontological argument was acceptable, even when the\nargument’s validity was rejected. Gassendi, for example, agreed\nthat God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived, but\ndenied the validity of the argument which offers this as its main\npremise (See further Osler 1994, ch. 2). Nor was the argument from\ninnate ideas more popular. After his dialogue character Cuphophron has\nespoused it, Henry More has his down to earth Hylobares burst out: \nBoyle, too, held that design arguments were both available and the\nmost likely to persuade rational, open-minded hearers. Such arguments\nwere intended to form a large part of a book on atheism, something he\nworked on throughout his adult life but never published, though parts\nof it were used in various other works of a theological\n nature.[21]\n Boyle did, however, leave a plan of the intended work, and in the\nmanuscript remains — seven volumes of correspondence, forty-six\nvolumes of miscellaneous papers and eighteen volumes of notebooks\n— there are still a number of unpublished fragments and some\nlonger selections which he intended for this work. \nBoyle intended “the little Tract about Atheism” to have\nthree sections: \nIn the First of these, the Author represents some Reasons why it\nshould not be thought strange if it be found somewhat difficult to\ndemonstrate the Existence of a Deity. \nIn the second section <the Author> haveing premisd, that the\nforegoing Reasons make it Equitable not to expect metaphysical or\nrigid Demonstrations of a Deity, but to be content with a moral one,\nif no better can be had, proceeds to the mediums whereof such a\nDemonstration can be made up. Such as are \nThe general Consent of mankind. (To one of which or both may be\nreferrd the Epicurean Anticipation.) \nThe Reproaches or Boadings & Disquieting Terrors of a Guilty\nConscience \nThe Fabrick & Conservation of the world, especially of Animals \nThe Nature & Propertys of the Soul of Man \nThe Lawes of its Union with the\n Body[22] \nThe Universal Providence that directs the Affairs of Mankind. \nSupernatural Effects whether of good or Evil Spirits (as their\nApparitions Action Oracles Predictions &c) \nThe Patefactions that God has made of himselfe by true miracles. (To\nwhich Prophecies are reduc’d.) \nThe Third section is spent in shewing some of the Reasons why the\nArguments proposd in the Second are often unprevalent. \nWell, that was the plan, and Boyle certainly thought that the design\narguments he intended for section two should convince the open-minded.\nMoreover, he thought, such arguments should particularly convince\nthose who were knowledgeable about nature, who knew enough about the\ndetails of the world to be impressed by the intricacy of the\npresumed workmanship. “[T]here are,” he wrote,\n“positive Reasons afforded by Philosophy to prove a Deity,\nnamely … the Cartesian Idæa, the Originall of Motion, the\nuse of Parts in Animalls, especially the Eye, the valves of the heart,\nthe musculi perforantes &\n perforati,[23]\n & the temporary\n [parts][24]\n of a foetus <& the Mother>.” \nThe argument from design, said Kant, “always deserves to be\nmentioned with respect. It is the oldest, the clearest, and the most\naccordant with the common reason of mankind” (Kant 1781,\nA623/B651). But, he pointed out, there was a problem with it, a\nproblem which in fact had already been pointed not only by David\n Hume,[25]\n but by Boyle’s younger contemporary, Charles Blount, who\nwrote, \nTo a large extent Boyle accepted these points. He notes explicitly\nthat none of the proofs he was prepared to offer amounted to a\ndemonstration of God’s existence, and indeed he felt\nthat a demonstration was not possible. A\ndemonstration was typically held to proceed from necessarily\ntrue premises (often Aristotelian\n principles[26])\n via a valid argument to a necessarily true conclusion, and part of\nwhat was at issue was whether we should be looking for a demonstration\nof God’s existence, or something less which would nonetheless\nstill be useful in the fight against atheism . “To haue the\nScience of a thing,” said Pierre du Moulin the elder, “two\ncertainties are required. The one is, that the thing be certaine of it\nselfe and vnchangeable. The second is, that the perswasion which wee\nhaue of it be firme and cleare” (Du Moulin 1624, 162). Gassendi\nagreed, as did Arnauld and Nicole in the Port Royal Logic (Gassendi\n1658, Canon XVI, 144; Arnauld 1662, part IV, ch 8, 323–4,\npagination as in the 5th, 1683 edition). \nThe persuasive alternative to a demonstration was sometimes styled a\nproof, but often people spoke of moral\ndemonstrations as opposed to strict, or mathematical, demonstrations.\nBoyle wrote: \nAnd this third kind of Probation, though it come behind the\ntwo others in certainty, yet it is the surest guide, which the\nActions of Men, though not their Contemplations,\nhave regularly allow’d them to follow (BW, 8:281; Boyle 1772,\n4:182–3). \nThis moral certainty, Locke remarked, “is not only as great as\nour frame can attain to, but as our Condition needs” (Locke\n1690, 4.11.8). \nWhen we look in detail at Boyle’s discussions of the various\nmoral demonstrations outlined in his proposed second section it\nbecomes clear that he fancied some considerably more than others. He\noften mentions the importance of conscience, but concentrates, as far\nas proofs go, on various design arguments, on arguments based on the\nincorporeality of the human soul, and on arguments involving miracles.\nUnlike the clerical authors of the time he pays little or no attention\nto the arguments from “the innate Idea of the Deity,” from\n“the general Consent of Mankind,” or from “the\nUniversal Providence that directs the Affairs of Mankind.” \nBoyle did not expect his (or anyone’s) proofs to convince most\natheists: \nBoyle was aware that most believers held their belief on insufficient\ngrounds (see BP 4:60, BOA §3.7.5, pp. 301–2), but felt\nhimself fortunate in that sound philosophy showed that the religion to\nwhich he was born was the correct one. For Boyle, miracles (in\nparticular the miracle of Pentecost) were a crucial factor in opting\nfor Christianity. The Christian miracles, he felt, clearly bore the\nstamp of God upon them. There were, he agreed, other miracles or\napparent miracles, but the miracles which purported to establish\nChristianity were neither false nor diabolical, and they were\nmiraculous. Locke believed that “Mahomet having none to produce,\npretends to no miracles for the vouching of his mission,” but\nBoyle was aware of the argument that the Koran itself is\nmiraculous (in view of the disparity between it and what might\nreasonably be expected of its author in the absence of divine\ninspiration). He felt, not that this argument was inappropriate, but\nthat it failed the test empirically: \nBoyle does not deny that the style could have been miraculous, and\nindeed he runs a formally similar argument concerning the Apostles and\nthe miracle of Pentecost: the Apostles’ “Hearers …\nknew it was <not> naturally possible, that uninspir’d\nPersons, and especially illiterate Fishermen, should <grow>\nable, in a trice, to make <weighty> discourses to many differing\nNations, in their respective Languages” (BP 7:99, BOA\n§3.6.29, p. 390). Boyle accepts, and indeed uses, the\nform of the Koran argument: it is the premise he\ndisputes. \nBoyle is ambivalent about the function of miracles. Generally he\nregards them as being philosophically relevant after we have a proof\nof God’s existence, something which natural theology will afford\nus. (Boyle fastens on two main types of design arguments: those\ninvolving the complexity of animate beings, particularly very small\nanimate\n beings,[28]\n and those which highlight the need to explain the origin and\ncontinuing function of natural laws: God must not only sustain\nGod’s creatures, Boyle argues, he must also sustain the\nregularities which we recognize as lawlike.) \nHaving convinced ourselves of God’s existence through the\nconsiderations which natural theology makes available to us, and\nrealizing that God is likely to institute a religion to make his\nnature and requirements known to us, we look to miracles to see which\ninstituted religion is the correct one. However, though in general\nBoyle argues that accepting something as a miracle\npresupposes God’s existence, and so miracles are to be\nused to institute the correct religion rather than to ground\nits metaphysical basis, he does sometimes urge an argument from\nmiracles which will yield not merely the correctness of Christianity,\nbut the acceptability of religious belief as such. Briefly: we have\ngood historical testimony for the occurrence of miracles, but miracles\nare possible only if God intervenes in nature (and thereby exists) (BP\n5:106–7, BOA §3.8.3, pp. 310–12). \nBoyle had a straightforward notion of creation. First of all God, at a\nparticular, fairly recent, point in absolute time, made matter. Boyle\nwas an admirer of “our Irish St.\nAustin”(BC 1:40), James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh,\nwho famously propounded what seems to us, though not to his\ncontemporaries, to be a very late date (4004 b.c.) for creation. Boyle\nsaw “no just reason to embrace their opinion, that would so turn\nthe two first chapters of Genesis, into an allegory, as to\noverthrow the literal and historical sense of them” and, noting\nthe implausibility of the claims of “some extravagant ambitious\nPeople, such as those fabulous Chaldeans, whose fond account\nreach’d up to 40000 or 50000 years,” held that\n“Theology teaches us, that the World is very far from being so\nold by 30 or 40 thousand years as they … have presum’d:\nand does, from the Scripture, give us such an account of the age of\nthe World, that it has set us certain Limits, within which so long a\nDuration may be bounded, without mistaking in our Reckoning. Whereas\nPhilosophy leaves us to the vastness of Indeterminate Duration,\nwithout any certain Limits at all” (BW, 8:21; Birch 1772,\nIV:11). Revelation gives us (1) truths of which we would otherwise be\nignorant, such as “the order and time of the Creation of the\nWorld and of the first man and woman”; (2) details of truths\nwhich we can otherwise obtain “but very dimly, incogently, and\ndefectively” \nAdditionally there are (3) “hints” which lead us\nto truths we would otherwise miss, such as “that whatever men\nhave generally believ’d, Vegetables had their Origine\nindependent from the Sun, the earth having producd all kinds of plants\na day before God made that Luminary” (BP 7:243, 4:15, BW\n14:271). Moreover, \nUnsurprisingly, then, Boyle makes a point of attempting to bring his\ncreation story into line with a literal interpretation of the Genesis\nstory. God, he believes, could have started things off earlier or\nlater, but chose not to. Having created matter, he broke it up and\nstarted it moving. Sometimes Boyle says he broke it up by\nstarting it\n moving.[29]Then he gave it laws, since the “casual justlings of\natoms” would not, Boyle thinks, have given rise to this\n world.[30]\n Hooke, explicating Genesis, argued for the same ordering. For Boyle\nand Hooke, that is, a world without laws is not only possible, our\nworld was such a world for a time. In the previous century Konrad\nDaspodius held that comets “drift without laws,” but by\n1686 Leibniz was writing, “God does nothing out of order, and it\nis impossible even to feign events which are not\n regular.”[31]\n Leibniz’s point was that just as any ‘random’\nsequence of points will determine a curve (actually an infinite set of\ncurves, but Leibniz only needed the lesser claim), so any sequence of\nevents will conform to a regular pattern. Generalizing, we might say\nthat just as points underdetermine equations, so facts underdetermine\ntheories. \nIt should be noted however that for Leibniz, as for a number of his\ncontemporaries, not all such laws need be laws of\n nature.[32]\n Malebranche, for example, in his Dialogues on Metaphysics,\noffered no fewer than five distinct types of law: “general laws\nof the communication of motion, … laws of the union of soul and\nbody, … laws of the union of the soul with God, with the\nintelligible substance of universal Reason, … general laws\nwhich give good and bad Angels power over bodies, … finally,\nthe laws by which Jesus Christ received sovereign power in Heaven and\non earth, over minds as well as bodies, not only to distribute\ntemporal goods … but to diffuse (répandre)\ninternal grace in our hearts” (Entretiens sur la\nMétaphysique, in Malebranche 1962,\n 12:319–320).[33] \nBoyle’s position is an intermediate one between the claim that\nsome objects or events are lawless, and the claim that lawlessness is\nimpossible. For Boyle, physical objects do exhibit nomological\nregularities, but this is a contingent fact about the world, or\nrather, for Boyle was cautious about generalizing, about the\nspatio-temporal portion of it we occupy. He agrees, however, that\nthere are laws that are not laws of nature, with the laws of\ninterconnection between body and soul providing, for him, an obvious\nexample. This interconnection also provides a clear example of a state\nwhich God constantly preserves. \nAfter having made matter, started it moving, and given it laws, God\nthen formed the matter into particular structures and shapes,\nincluding certain “seeds.” Then he added some\n“seminal principles” with formative plastic powers. Boyle\ndoes not clearly indicate whether or not these are a special subclass\nof natural laws affecting matter, or whether they are in some way what\nhe sometimes calls “supra-mechanical,” though he does\npoint out that if there is a mechanism for animal inheritance, then it\nwould seem to require a framing intelligent agent (BW, 12:445–6,\nBirch 1772, VI:728–9. See Anstey 2002a and Inglehart 2015 for a\nfull discussion of the issue.). His older contemporary Harvey, much\nadmired by Boyle, was in no doubt about the matter, pouring scorn on\nthose who talk \nAll this holds for the corporeal universe, as opposed to the three\nsorts of incorporeal creatures God created or, in our case, continues\nto create: angels, evil demons, and human souls: the good, the bad,\nand the\n imprisoned.[34]\n The angels were created “before the visible World … was\nhalf compleated,” but God creates new human souls daily, and\nmoreover works a “physical miracle” to attach them to\ntheir respective bodies (BP 7:243, 4:14, BW 14:271; BP\n 2:62).[35]\n Sometimes Boyle felt that although humans are made in God’s\nimage they, like other created beings, are “at their best but\numbratile, and Arbitrary Pictures of God their Creatour” (BP\n4:4, BOA §2.2.38, p. 145). Elsewhere, however, he offers a more\ntraditional account of the soul as the image of God: \nAlthough humans are made in the image of God, they are considerably\nless clever than the\n angels,[36]\n and since it is quite possible that God’s primary end in making\nthe universe was to provide a universe for the angels, and not\ncentrally for humans, it is thereby quite possible that the universe\nwill be too complicated for us to understand: \n“[W]e presume too much of our own abilities,” Boyle wrote,\nc. 1680, “if we imagine that the omniscient God can have no\nother Ends in the framing & managing of Things Corporeal, than\nsuch as we Men can discover” (Boyle MS 198, fol. 120, BP 7:116,\nBOA §3.6.3, p 267). It follows at once that while simplicity may\noften be our best guide as to what working hypothesis to choose, we\nshould not think it to be inevitably a reliable guide to truth. \nWhy did God create the universe in this piecemeal way? What is\nBoyle’s rationale for thinking that God didn’t just start\noff by creating matter in motion with the proper directed velocities\nand letting it give rise to the present world in its own good time? Or\nwhy not suppose that he created the present world as a going\nconcern? Boyle doesn’t tell us, but two points stand out. \nFirst of all, it certainly fits the fact that Boyle has a very limited\nview of\n omnipotence.[37]\n Here he is, for example, bemused by the swiftness of God’s\ncreative ability: \nDoing things step by step, fairly quickly, and with moderate success,\nwas quite enough to excite Boyle’s admiration for the Almighty\nand, though he had certainly read Descartes’s\nPrinciples (in which Descartes remarks explicitly that\nalthough God could have let things work their way from a very\ndifferent initial state to the present world, in fact God\nstarted the world off in medias res), it is quite possible\nthat the alternative did not strike him as likely: he was not, after\nall, a mathematician, or even a mathematical\n physicist.[39] \nGiven this, and the fact that motion was not natural to matter, but\nhad to be added to it, it would seem plausible to Boyle that God\ncreated matter first, and then gave it a push, particularly since the\npush had to be precisely fine tuned in order to yield just the world\nwe now have. (That matter is not naturally in motion forms the basis\nof one of Boyle’s criticisms of Epicurus. Boyle takes Epicurus\nto hold that motion is an innate property of matter. How\nthen, asks Boyle, are we to explain the fact that it is lost or\nchanged as a result of collision between particles? (BP 2:5, BOA\n§4.1, p 340).) Additionally, Boyle notices that no system of laws\ncan offer a complete explanation: we also need an account of the\ninitial\n parameters.[40]\n But then, since they are logically distinct, why not have them\nchronologically distinct as well? \nSecondly, there are, perhaps, historical reasons. For Boyle is\nconscious of himself as building on past views, and such views\ntypically treated matter as giving rise to the present world, and, in\nthe case of some past thinkers, at least, as having existed in a\nconstant state for some time before the initiating changes that led to\nthe present world occurred. The notion of a piecemeal creation, that\nis, fits Boyle’s views of God’s abilities, fits\nGenesis, and fits the views of previous thinkers. Probably we\ndo not need to look farther for an explanation for his adopting such a\nview. \nGod created a material world in time and space, but what kind of\nmatter, what kind of space, what kind of time? As to the matter, Boyle\nagreed with contemporaries such as Huygens and Newton that\n“Matter [is] in its own Nature but\n one.”[41]\n However Boyle, cautious as ever, explicitly allows God the\npossibility of creating matter which is not like ordinary\nmatter, and instituting laws which are quite unlike the laws that\nobtain on earth. His views are worth quoting at length: \n[T]he World must every way have bounds, and consequently be finite; or\nit must not have bounds, and so be … infinite. And if\nthe World be bounded, then those that believe a\n Deity,[42]\n to whose Nature it belongs to be of infinite Power, must not deny\nthat God was, and still\n is,[43]\n able to make other Worlds than this of ours. … \nNow if we grant, with some modern Philosophers, that God has made\nother Worlds besides this of ours, it will be highly probable that he\nhas there display’d His manifold Wisdom, in productions very\ndiffering from those wherein we here admire it. And even without\nsupposing any more than one Universe, as all that portion of it that\nis visible to us, makes but a part of that vastly extended aggregate\nof bodies: So if we but suppose, that some of the Celestial Globes,\nwhether visible to us, or plac’d beyond the reach of our sight,\nare peculiar Systemes, the consideration will not be very different.\nFor since the fix’d stars are many of them incomparably more\nremote than the Planets, ‘tis not absurd to suppose that as the\nSun, who is the fix’d star nearest to us, has a whole Systeme of\nPlanets that move about him, so some of the other fix’d Stars\nmay be each of them the Centre, as it were, of another Systeme of\nCelestial Globes … . Now, in case there be other Mundane\nSystemes (if I may so speak) besides this visible one of ours, I think\nit may be probably suppos’d that God may have given peculiar and\nadmirable instances of His inexhausted Wisedom in the Contrivance and\nGovernment of Systemes, that for aught we know may be fram’d and\nmanag’d in a manner quite differing, from what is observ’d\nin that part of the Universe that is known to us. … [H]ere on\nEarth the Loadstone is a Mineral so differing in divers affections,\nnot onely from all other Stones, but from all other bodies, that are\nnot Magnetical, that this\n Heteroclite[44]\n Mineral scarce seems to be Originary of this World of ours, but to\nhave come into it, by a remove from some other World or Systeme\n… . \nNow in these other Worlds, besides that we may suppose that\nthe Original Fabrick … into which the Omniscient Architect at\nfirst contriv’d the parts of their matter, was very differing\nfrom the structure of our Systeme; besides this, I say, we\nmay conceive that there may be a vast difference betwixt the\nsubsequent Phænomena, and productions observable in one\nof those Systemes, from what regularly happens in\nours, though we should suppose no more, than that two or\nthree Laws of Local Motion may be differing in those unknown Worlds,\nfrom the Laws that obtain in ours (BW, 10:172–3, Birch 1772,\nV:138–139). \nBoyle, that is, sees three distinct possibilities: the initial set up\nmay differ, the matter involved may differ, and the laws in question\nmay differ. Moreover the laws, as well as the matter, could have been\nformed differently by God, and could indeed vary from part to part of\nthe current universe within the universe. Clearly the case of\nvarying laws and the case of varying matter may run into each other,\nbut Boyle treats them as distinct possibilities, and gives as an\nexample the possibility of a combination of conservation and\nnon-conservation possibilities: we can envisage bodies with the\n“power of exciting Motion in another Body, without the Movents\nloosing its own.” Were this to be the case the resulting\nphenomena would be “strangely diversifyed.” Moreover, God\nmay have made a universe, or a part of this universe, which was such\nthat “some parts of matter [would] be of themselves\nquiescent … and determin’d to continue at rest\ntill some outward Agent force it into motion [while] other\nparts of the matter [may have] a Power … of restlessly moving\nthemselves, without loosing that power by the motion they excite in\nquiescent bodies. … Nor is it so extravagant a thing, as at\nfirst it may seem, to entertain such suspicions as these. For in the\ncommon Philosophy, besides that the Notion and Theory of Local Motion\nare but very imperfectly propos’d, there are Laws or Rules of it\nnot well, not to say at all,\n establish’d.”[45] \nBoyle does not use the terminology of absolute space and time, but he\nremarks that God could have made the world earlier: \nBoyle’s general view about both space and time is that since\nthey are \nHe also remarks about the world that \nMoreover, there is a \nAgain, Boyle writes: “Suppose a Ball were in motion, & all\nthe world should be on a sudden annihilated about it; why may not the\nmotion of that Ball be continu’d? there being nothing to stop\nit; & if it be continu’d, we have a motion where the mobile\ndos not quitt the neighborhood of som bodys, and approach nearer to\nothers” (BP 1:3). \nWe have, then, Boyle’s view that a body can continue “in\nthe same place precisely,” that the whole (finite)\nuniverse might move in space, and that God could have created the\nworld earlier than he did. Such views do not at least amount to a\nrejection of absolute space and time. Boyle’s\ncontemporary, Leibniz, who did reject absolute space, explicitly drew\nthe conclusion that a finite universe could not move as a\nwhole in space, and could not have been created earlier in\n time.[48] \nThe universe God created, then, contains a number of finite\nincorporeal entities, for whom the writ of physics does not\nrun, and a number of material entities, compounded as far as we are\naware, of the same matter in every case, set in a space and time\nindependent of them, and subject to a number of God given laws. \nAs for teleology, Boyle wrote an influential treatise entitled A\nDisquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things which\nappeared in 1686. In opposition to Epicurus, he argued that there are\nfinal causes and in opposition to Descartes, he claimed that in many\ncases we can have epistemic access to these final causes, though he\nagreed that we ought not be presumptuous in these matters. According\nto Boyle, there are four types of final cause that we can know. First,\nthere are the “grand and General Ends of the whole World, such\nas the Exercising and Displaying the Creators immense Power\n….” Second, are the ends in the nature and motions of the\ncelestial objects and the Earth. Third, there are the ends that\npertain to the parts of animals and fourth there are human ends (BW,\n11:87). Boyle was quite adamant that there are no ends that pertain to\ninanimate objects. In particular, he rejects any form of immanent\nteleology in virtue of which material objects are able to direct their\nbehaviour: “For inanimate Agents act not by choice, but by a\nnecessary impulse, and not being endow’d with Understanding and\nWill, cannot of themselves be able to moderate or to suspend their\nactions” (BW, 4:267. See Carlin 2011, 2012). \nOn a number of occasions Boyle assures us that “God [is] the\nAuthor of the universe & free Establisher of the Laws of motion,\nwhose generall Concourse is necessary to the conservation &\nEfficacy of every particular Physicall Agent” (BP 2:132). The\ntrouble is, he seems to have thought that this remark was fairly\ntransparent, and does not trouble to explain it to us. Moreover, he\ntends to use much the same phraseology on each occasion he discusses\nthe issue. It was a commonplace of the time that Boyle was no stylist\n— it was obvious at times to Boyle himself — but though\neven the obsequious Budgell remarked that Boyle was “too wordy\nand prolix,” in this case at least he was not wordy enough\n(Budgell 1732, 124). \nIt is tempting to suppose that Boyle must have had some reasonably\nwell thought out views on the question of how God sustains\nthe world. He was after all one of the most impatient of thinkers when\nit came to fake or non-explanations, and he was in general very aware\nof the danger of letting verbal ‘explanations’ get in the\nway of real ones. He objected against the scholastics, for example\nthat \nOn the other hand, in theology he was more likely than elsewhere to\nlet things get by, since he was convinced in advance that his\ntheological picture was the right one, and he was used to stifling\ndoubts about theological claims. Writing about himself in the third\nperson as a young man he speaks of the “fleeting Clouds”\nof doubts which never ceased “now & then to darken /obscure/\nthe clearest serenity of his quiet: which made him often say that\nInjections of this Nature were such a Disease to his Faith as the\nTooth-ach is to the Body; for tho it be not mortall, ‘tis very\ntroublesome” (BP 37:182r). (These doubts persisted: see Hunter\n1990, 410.) \nMoreover, he had a well worked out doctrine concerning the limitations\nof reason, and often points out that we should not expect fully to\nunderstand God’s workings, for God is, after all, “<a\nBeing> of a most Primary and most singular Nature” (BP 2:107,\n2:37, BOA § 4.1, p 357). (For different interpretations of Boyle\non the limits of reason see Wojcik 1997, Holden 2007 and Marko 2014.)\nFurthermore, he was willing to admit the impossibility of our\nunderstanding — at least given the present limitations on our\nintellects — even quite ordinary and lawlike matters, e.g., the\nway in which the human soul and human body interact. How God could\nhave created the world, and how it is that he can intervene in it, are\nmatters as mysterious to us as how mind and body can interact, and\nthat is a total mystery. \nSometimes, Boyle remarks, our ignorance of things has to do simply\nwith our lack of knowledge of the inner or hidden workings of a thing.\nHe offers his, and indeed the century’s, standard example of\nclocks which may have various internal mechanisms to produce the same\nouter effects. Thus he remarks that “we know in general, that\ndigestion is made by some Menstruum or subtile substance in\nthe Stomach; thô we know not the particular nature of that\nsubstance, (as whether it be Acid, Urinous, &c.)”.\nSometimes, though, our ignorance is of a deeper, richer variety: \nBoyle was impatient with the Cartesian suggestion that we might be\nable to alter the direction though not the quantity of motion, not for\nLeibniz’s reason that the notion of quantity of motion required\na confusion between momentum and kinetic\n energy,[50]\n but for the straightforward reason that interfering with the directed\nvelocity required as mysterious an interaction as altering the\n‘quantity of motion’ would. He was aware of the Cartesian\nclaim “that the rational Soul doth [not] give any motion to the\nparts of the Body, but only guide or regulate that\nwhich she finds in them already” (BW, 9:379, Birch 1772,\nIV:416), but that, he felt, did not really solve the problem, for that\ninteraction was as mysterious as an energy introducing one: “I\ndo as little conceive how the motions of the Conarion can\nwork upon an Immaterial soul, as how any other part of the Body can do\nit. Nor do I conceive how an Immaterial Soul can work upon the\nConarion its self, more then it can upon any other part of\nthe Body” (BP 1:128 BOA §3.5.15, p 253), and he notes that\nit will not “suffice to object, that the human will does, in\nthese cases, not produce any new motion, but only determine[s] the\nmotions of the spirits, and by their means of the locomotive organs.\nFor to put a check, at pleasure, to the motion of a body, that does\nalready actually move in one line, and determine its motion to\ncontinue in another, that is perhaps differing from it, or even\nopposite to it; to do this, I say, without opposing to the moving\nbody, some other body, which, by its resistance and situation may\nchange its former course, is not a mechanical operation” (BW,\n12:480, Birch 1772, VI:756). A change of direction, just as much as a\nchange in the ‘quantity of motion,’ is in fact as\nmysterious and inexplicable, if done by incorporeal means, as the\nintroduction of energy into the system would be. \nMany of us learned at school that Boyle’s Law holds for ideal\ngases and can be summarized as PV = k, where k is a constant, and P\nand V are pressure and volume respectively. This law does stem from\nBoyle’s work, but it is not what Boyle took himself to have\n demonstrated.[51] \nBoyle was arguing specifically against a Jesuit scientist, Franciscus\nLinus, who claimed, not that ordinary atmospheric air does not have\nany pressure (a spring), but that its pressure was not sufficiently\npowerful for it to do all the things it does in fact do. So Boyle\ndecided on an experiment to show the way in which, as we would say,\nthe pressure and the volume of the air vary, when the air is, in\nBoyle’s words, either ‘compressed or dilated.’ \nHe and his assistant, at the time Robert Hooke, made a J shaped tube\nand began to make a few measurements, but “were hindered from\nprosecuting the trial at that time by the casual breaking of the\ntube.” \nSubsequently they made another, larger, better piece of apparatus, and\ntaking particular care that the measurements should be accurate,\ntested the hypothesis “that supposes the pressures and\nexpansions to be in reciprocal proportion.” The results are set\nout, with misprints, in two tables, and Boyle’s conclusion was\nthat the experimental findings matched the predicted results very well\nin the case of compression, less well in the case of rarefaction.\nBoyle suggested that the divergence from the expected result in the\ncase of rarefaction may have been due to “some little aerial\nbubbles in the quicksilver” (“so easy is it in such nice\nexperiments to miss of exactness,” he added). \nNow, what did Boyle take himself to have shown? First, that there is,\nas a matter of experimental fact, a spring to the air: this is not in\nthe sense in which Boyle understands the term, any longer an\nhypothesis: it is now obvious from the experimental results: what\nexplains, or purports to explain this fact will be a theory or an\nhypothesis, but the result itself is in no sense an hypothesis. As\nBoyle said \nSecondly, Boyle takes himself to have shown that, for atmospheric air,\nwithin the limits of his experimental set-up, “the pressures and\nexpansions [are] in reciprocal proportion,” or, as we would say,\npressure and volume vary inversely. He doesn’t take himself to\nhave shown anything more than this. He does remark that further\nexperiments may show that the relationship holds outside the boundary\nconditions imposed by the experimental set-up, but the experiments he\nhas just made certainly don’t show that. What Boyle expressly\nsaid was, \nThus Boyle’s Law, for Boyle, was not a universal generalization\nabout ideal gases: it was a strictly limited claim about common or\natmospheric air. Boyle did add that “there is no cause to doubt,\nthat if we had been here furnished with a greater quantity of\nquicksilver and a very strong tube, we might, by a further compression\nof the included air, have made it counter balance the pressure of a\nfar taller and heavier cylinder of mercury.” \nBut he did not claim that the same ratio between pressure and volume\nwould hold in such more extreme cases. Nor did he claim that there are\nno limits to the possible compression. It is worth stressing that\nBoyle had this limited view of his result, for Shapin and Schaffer\n1985 suggest that \nBut Boyle was quite happy not to draw such conclusions, simply because\nhis experiments didn’t allow that kind of jump. There are other\nimportant ways in which he thought that generalizations about nature\nmight fail of universality. He had a very healthy notion of the\ncomplexity of the world, and an acute sense of the difficulties to\nwhich even apparently simple experiments could give rise. In fact,\nBoyle had was one of the first philosophers ever to develop a\nphilosophy of experiment. \nBoyle was one of the first philosophers to develop a philosophy of\nexperiment. His view, which derived in part from Francis Bacon, has\nmany parallels with that of his fellow experimenter Robert Hooke and\nthis Bacon-Boyle-Hooke philosophy of experiment came to exert great\ninfluence on the development of natural philosophy in the late\nseventeenth century (Anstey 2014). \nBoyle’s view of experiment is best understood in the context of\nthe newly emerging experimental philosophy of the early Royal Society\nof London in the early 1660s and its precursor groups in Oxford in the\nlate 1650s. At this time the discipline of natural philosophy was\nshifting from being regarded as a speculative science, like, say,\ntheology, to being an operative or practical science in which\nexperiments played a central role. \nThe first tenet of Boyle’s philosophy of experiment is that\nobservation and experiment should have epistemic priority over theory.\nThat is, one should accept only those principles and axioms in natural\nphilosophy that are based upon sufficient observational and\nexperimental evidence and one should avoid constructing a theory\nwithout recourse to observation and experiment. Speculative philosophy\ncommences with principles that are accepted without recourse to\nexperiment, whereas experimental philosophy begins with observation\nand experiment and only then proceeds to theory. \nSecondly, Boyle believes that although one should not start\none’s inquiries from untested principles, one can nevertheless\nreason upon experiments: \nIt is hardly surprising then to find that Boyle wrote quite\nextensively on the relation between experimental philosophy and\nspeculative philosophy and on the usefulness of reason to the\nexperimental philosopher. For example, in a catalogue of his\nunpublished works dating from 1684 there is listed a work entitled\n“Of Usefulnes of Speculative & Experimental Philosophy to\none another” (BW, 14:342). Unhappily this work is no longer\nextant. \nThirdly, according to Boyle, once a theory is constructed, the natural\nphilosopher should be prepared to revise it in the light of new\nexperimental evidence: “I would have such kind of\nsuperstructures look’d upon only as temporary ones\n…” (BW, 2:14). The only things that Boyle will remain\ncertain of are matters of fact: “I dare speak confidently and\npositively of very few things, except Matters of Fact” (BW,\n2:19). \nFourthly, while Boyle believed in ultimate causes underlying natural\nphenomena, he also acquiesced in Bacon’s conception of a scale\nof causes and the need to discover intermediate causes en route\nto ultimate explanations: \nOne such intermediate cause that was of great importance for Boyle is\nthe spring (or pressure) of the air (see Anstey 2002b; Chalmers 2012).\nBoyle was aware that this quality was not one of those causes\n“that are the highest in the scale or series of Causes”\n(BW, 2:21), and that he had to be content with its intermediate\nstatus. \nThis cluster of doctrines about experiment was set in Boyle’s\nwritings within a broader Baconian context, namely the Baconian method\nof natural history. Baconian natural histories were, in the first\ninstance, vast collections of matters of fact derived from observation\nand experiment and which were to provide the foundation for natural\nphilosophical theorising. (In fact, few natural philosophers were able\nto respect this two-stage process.) They are to be distinguished from\nclassificatory natural history that was concerned with describing and\nclassifying natural kinds (Ogilvie 2006). Thus, many of Boyle’s\nactual experimental reports are found in works that are natural\nhistories after the style of Francis Bacon. For example, Boyle viewed\nhis famous air-pump experiments that led eventually to the discovery\nof Boyle’s Law, as part of a broader natural history of the air.\nIndeed, the philosopher John Locke, who was also committed to the\nBaconian method of natural history, edited Boyle’s General\nHistory of the Air and saw it through the press the year after\nBoyle died. \nThere are two important implications for Boyle’s philosophy of\nexperiment that derive from the natural historical context in which it\nwas set. First, it accounts for the fact that many of Boyle’s\nexperiments were almost completely divorced from theory – they\nwere experiments that “had a life of their own,” –\nto use Ian Hacking’s felicitous phrase (Hacking 1983, chapter\n9). Secondly, the natural historical context helps to explain the very\nrich typology of experiments that Boyle used. Boyle followed Bacon in\ndistinguishing between luciferous (light-bearing) experiments that\nrevealed underlying causes and fructiferous (fruit-bearing)\nexperiments, that produced useful knowledge and technologies. This\ndistinction was widely used in the seventeenth century. Another type\nof experiment that derives from Bacon, was named by Boyle and was made\nfamous by Newton. This was the crucial experiment (experimentum\ncrucis) (BW, 3:50–1). \nHe also coined the term ‘exploratory experiment’ to\ndescribe a form of experimentation that includes ‘The devising\nof New and convenient Tools or other Instruments for altering the\nusual State or the common course of things, and for thereby reducing\nnature to vary her Course and afford the Enquirers some new\nPhaenomena’ (BP, 9:52). This is clearly a precursor of the\nmodern notion of exploratory experiment (Steinle 2016). \nBoyle was fully aware that some of the central tenets of his view of\nexperiments and his own natural historical methodology derived from\nthe writings of Francis Bacon. But he did not believe that Bacon was\nthe first to practise experimental philosophy. Interestingly, Boyle\nbelieved that his approach to natural philosophy found precedents in\nsome of the presocratic philosophers, such as the Greek atomist\nDemocritus and the (shadowy) Phoenician Moschus whom he surmised were\nexperimental corpuscularians (Levitin 2014). \nTwo distinct notions of the soul occupied centre stage in the\nseventeenth century. One, stemming from Plato and the Pythagoreans,\nwith theological trimmings by Augustine, had been given immense\nprestige by Descartes’ championing of it. This view was what\nGeach has called the “savage superstition … that a man\nconsists of two pieces, body and soul, which come apart at\ndeath.” Geach adds, “the superstition is not mended but\nrather aggravated by conceptual confusion, if the soul-piece is\nsupposed to be immaterial” (Geach 1969, 38). \nThe second main account, stemming from Aristotle, had been taken over\nand made Christian by St Thomas\n Aquinas.[52]\n In this account the soul was, though incorporeal, not simply a\nseparate bit attached to the body, but was the form of the individual\nanimal in question, whether human or not. Aquinas presented arguments\nto show that human souls were subsistent in view of various capacities\nthey had, and proceeded from there to argue for the possibility of the\ncontinuing existence of human souls in the absence of the body. He\nwas, however, clear that the human person (even when the person in\nquestion was Christ in human form) was not merely a soul with an\nattached body, but was the body informed by the soul: if your soul\nalone were to survive death you would not. Bodily resurrection is\nessential to the survival and immortality of humans. \nCartesians and Thomists alike believed on scriptural grounds that\nthere were actual cases of separated souls, namely, the angels, fallen\nand unfallen, so the possibility that the human soul might itself be\nsubsistent was simply the possibility that it might sufficiently\nresemble an already accepted ontological group: despite the problems\nthat substance dualism raises, a number of which presented themselves\nclearly to Boyle, there was no general problem concerning\nincorporeal entities, and there were, Boyle felt, strong arguments for\nthe incorporeality of the human soul. \nFor Boyle, as for other leading seventeenth century figures,\nperception was a matter of information entering the brain as a result\nof causal interaction between the perceiver and the perceived object.\nArriving at the brain the information was processed by a subsystem or\nset of subsystems devoted to presenting it to the cognitive system,\nand to storing it thereafter. The initial processing was done by a\nsystem, the common sense, that combined the inputs from the\nvarious sense organs (left eye + right eye; eyes + ears; etc.) and it\nwas then imagined — that is, an image was formed in the\nbrain though, as Kepler and Descartes noted explicitly, the image was\nnot a literal, optical, image. That apart, seventeenth century\nthinkers accepted in general outline the position which had already\nbeen set out in the thirteenth century by Roger Bacon, who was in turn\nsimply collating the views of earlier Islamic writers on the subject,\nthough of course the details, particularly the details of the causal\ninteraction between percipient and perceived, varied from writer to\nwriter (See further Lindberg 1976, MacIntosh 1983, and Sutton\n1998). \nImagination was a matter of material images being formed in the brain.\nBut, it was held by Boyle and others, we have knowledge of things\nwhich are literally unimaginable — that is, they cannot be\naccurately represented by a corporeal image in the central nervous\nsystem. There were a variety of reasons for this belief. First it was\nheld that there were things which were too large, and things which\nwere too small to be imagined, that is, imaged. Hence some\nnon-material faculty was needed to account for this ability.\nAdditionally, there are things which are not image-able because they\ncannot be represented accurately by any physical system.\nBoyle’s stock example in this area, though not his only example,\nis the incommensurability of the sides and diagonal of a square. Since\n√2 is irrational no discrete (corpuscular) system can accurately\nrepresent both. But we do have knowledge of squares. Therefore we must\nbe employing a non-material system. Also, there were things such as\nDescartes’ chiliagon which, while they could be represented\nphysically, could not (as experience shows) be represented accurately\nby our physical imaging system. \nAdditionally (a familiar Aristotelian point), our ability to abstract\n— to consider universals and not merely particular instances\n— was held to provide further evidence for the incorporeality of\nthe soul and hence for the possibility at least of human\nimmortality. \nBoyle also noted, as did his contemporary Henry More, the Cambridge\nPlatonist, the occurrence of ecstasies. Boyle, like More, took the\nexistence of ecstasies seriously and, accepting the literal meaning of\nthe term, thought that such experiences showed the actuality of\nnon-corporeal, out-of-body, experiences. Boyle indeed offers the case\nas a refutation of the Aristotelian view that images are required for\nhuman thinking. Locke was more cautious on the issue: “whether\nthat, which we call Extasy, be not dreaming with the Eyes\nopen, I leave to be\n examined.”[53] \nThus, for Boyle, souls were almost certainly Cartesian souls, though\nas mentioned earlier he hesitates about whether or not the human soul\nmay not be a substantial form (BW, 5:300, Birch 1772, III:12). \nGiven that souls are incorporeal adjuncts of the body, it follows that\nthey are not materially destructible, and that the laws of\ninteraction between soul and body are not laws of natural philosophy.\nWhy grass looks green is a feature of the world which God\ndecided upon and upholds. His reasons for this decision, says Boyle,\nwere no doubt weighty, but they are, as to us, arbitrary (see, e.g.,\nBP 2:62, BOA §3.5.1, p 247; 2:105, BOA 3.5.21, p 258; 9:40;\n36.46v). Now, if our souls are non-material, that demolishes at least\none philosophical barrier to a belief in an after-life such as is\npromised by Christianity.

He was an\nexperimental philosopher, unwilling to construct abstract theories to\nwhich his experimental results had to conform. “Our\nBoyle,” Oldenburg wrote to Spinoza, “is one of those who\nare distrustful enough of their reasoning to wish that the phenomena\nshould agree with it” (Hall & Hall 1965–1977, 2:38).\nBoyle, a champion of both the corpuscularian doctrine and the Baconian\nmethod of natural history, preferred to report the results of his\nexperiments, including negative results, and frequently lamented the\nfact that we lacked “histories” (collections of\nexperimental results and accurate observations) in various fields of\nscientific endeavour. He performed so many experiments that he was\nable, at one “time to loose … at once near five centuries\nof Experiments of my own” (BP 9:28). Nor was this an isolated\nloss; nonetheless the number, variety and scope of his experiments\nwere such that he carried on working and publishing with no particular\ndifficulty. “His books,” as Huygens remarked to Leibniz\nimmediately after Boyle’s death, “are full of\nexperiments” (Huygens 1888, 10:239). Moreover, experiments were\nexactly what he was interested in, he had a certain\nmissionary zeal in spreading the corpuscularian gospel, but he was not\nhimself interested in detailed system\n building,[1]\n a fact that was commonly noted. Leibniz told Huygens that he was\n“astonished” that Boyle “who has so many fine\nexperiments, [had] not come to some theory of chemistry after\nmeditating so long on them. Yet in his books, and for all the\nconsequences that he draws from his observations, he concludes only\nwhat we all know, that everything happens mechanically. He is perhaps\ntoo reserved. Excellent men should leave us even their conjectures;\nthey are wrong if they wish to give us only those truths that are\ncertain” (Leibniz to Huygens, Dec. 29, 1691, in Huygens 1888,\n10:228). Boyle was ahead of his time. In the next century\nd’Alembert wrote “the taste for systems … is today\nalmost entirely banished from works of merit … a writer among\nus who praised systems would have come too late”\n(d’Alembert 1751,\n 94).[2]\n \n\nBoyle was a corpuscularian, a term he employed to paper over the\ndifferences between believers in a vacuum, and believers in a plenum,\ngiven that both of them agreed that the explanation of natural\noccurrences should be solely in terms of particles of matter, their\nmotion and interaction. Boyle consistently refused to pronounce on the\nquestion of whether these minima naturalia should be\nconsidered atoms, in the strict sense of that term, or\n not.[3]\n \n\nEven a metaphysical non-corpuscularian such as Leibniz agreed with\nBoyle in practical terms. “However much I agree with the\nScholastics in this general and, so to speak, metaphysical explanation\nof the principles of bodies,” he wrote to Arnauld in July 1686,\n“I am as corpuscular as one can be in the explanation of\nparticular phenomena, and it is saying nothing to allege that they\nhave forms or qualities” (Gerhardt 1875, 2:58, trans. Mason\n1967).\n\n\nBoyle’s scientific range was wide. Besides his well known work\nin mechanics, medicine, hydrostatics (Chalmers 2017, chap. 8) and a\nwide variety of experiments with his vacuum pump, he was interested\nboth theoretically and practically in alchemy (see Principe 1998,\nClericuzio 2000, Newman and Principe 2002), where his interest seems\nto have been fueled more by his constant desire to acquire knowledge\nof God and the world than by any desire for riches. He\n“cultivated Chymistry with a disinterested mind,” seeking\nthe improvement of his own knowledge, “the gratifying\nthe Curious & the Industrious; and the Acquist of some\nuseful helps to make good & uncommon\n Medicins.”[4]\n As a corpuscularian he believed that transmutation was physically\npossible. As a person he believed that it actually occurred. He\nbelieved that in his own laboratory gold had been transmuted into a\n“baser metal” with a specific gravity about two thirds of\nthat of gold, and since he was, he said, more interested in the\nluciferous aspect of discovery than the lucriferous, he found the\nprocess equally interesting in either\n direction.[5]\n \n\nDuring the course of his life he sought constantly to improve the lot\nof humanity. He was interested in the improvement of agricultural\nmethods, in the possibility of extracting fresh water from salt, in\nthe improvement of medicines and medicinal practice, in the\npossibility of preserving food by vacuum packing, and in a number of\nother useful results, actual or potential, of experimental philosophy.\nHe viewed his theological interests and his work in natural philosophy\nas forming a seamless whole and constantly used results from the one\narea to enlighten matters in the other. (On the relation between\nscience and religion in Boyle’s thought see Hunter 2000.)\n\n\nConvinced that Christianity was the religion instituted by God, Boyle\nwas concerned that the Bible should be widely promulgated and he\ndevoted time and energy to having it translated into a variety of\nlanguages such as Irish, Turkish, and various native American\nlanguages. He viewed such conversion attempts as being on all fours\nwith his attempts to find more efficacious medicines for:\n\n\n\nTo convert Infidels to the Christian Religion is a work of great\nCharity and kindnes to men. I. In regard of the evills it frees them\nfrom, such as, (1) the gross errors and prejudices they had\nentertain’d before they were instructed in it. (2ly) The vices\nand polutions they securely liv’d in, before they receiv’d\nthe Gospel; some of which were unworthy of men as such;\nothers very prejudicial to humane society’s; and\nothers very mischievous to the vicious persons themselves;\nand others <againe> great hinderances to the discovery\nand reception of usefull and noble truths. (3ly) The unexpressible\nInfelicitys that attend the greatest part of such Infidels &\nwicked Persons, in the future state.\n\n\nII. The Christian Religion brings mankind diverse positive Benefits,\nsuch as are, more cleare and extensive knowledg of God, and divine\nthings; the Remission of Sins; the Favour of God; severall graces and\nvertues suitable to mens respective needs and conditions; and above\nall, a happy Immortality in the Life to come. (Boyle Papers [BP]\n5:73–4; BOA §3.7.4, p 301)\n\n\nRobert Boyle was born in Lismore, Ireland, on January 25, 1627. He was\nhis parents’ fourteenth, penultimate, child, and the last to\nsurvive to adulthood. Boyle was the youngest son and, after his sister\nMargaret died when he was 10, the youngest child of the family. Boyle\nspeaks fondly of his parents, but he could not have known them well.\nHis mother died in childbirth a few weeks after Boyle’s third\nbirthday, and he last saw his father just before he and his brother\nFrancis left for a continental tour when Boyle was twelve. \nLike many children Boyle had his share of near escapes from serious\ninjury as a child, but the time and Boyle being what they were he saw\nin each of them the hand of God. Michael Hunter has pointed out that\n“the spiritual autobiography, aimed at chronicling God’s\npurpose for the individual in question by recounting providential\nescapes, spiritual trials and conversion experiences,” was\n“a characteristic genre of autobiographical writing in\nseventeenth-century England” (Hunter 1994a, xx), and Nicolas\nCanny notes that “The invocation of providence as an explanation\nfor accidental or chance happenings in this life was so commonplace\namong sincere Protestants in the early seventeenth century that it had\ncome to be considered irreverent or profane not so to attribute\nthem” (Canny 1982, 28). But, though common enough, there is no\ndoubt that, in Boyle’s case at least, the protestations were\nsincere. He continued to believe in this divine attention, though in a\nmore intellectual realm, throughout his life. In 1663 he wrote, \nIn Geneva on his continental tour Boyle underwent what he clearly felt\nto be a conversion from nominal or at least unthinking Christianity to\ncommitted Christianity. One summer night, he “was suddenly waked\nin a Fright with such loud Claps of Thunder … & every clap\n… both preceded & attended with Flashes of lightning so\nnumerous … & so dazling, that [he] began to imagine\n… the Day of Judgment’s being come.” This led him\nto vow that “all further additions to his life shud be more\nReligiously & carefully employ’d.” Realizing the\ninefficacy of a promise exacted under duress, Boyle repeated the\nperformance under a serene and cloudless sky “so solemnly that\nfrom that Day he dated his Conversion; renewing now he was past\nDanger, the vow he had made whilst he fancy’d himselfe to be in\nit: that tho his Feare was (& he blush’t it was so) the\n… occasion of his Resolution of Amendment; yet at least he\nmight not owe his more deliberate consecration … of himselfe to\nPiety, to any less noble Motive then that of it’s owne\nExcellence” (BP 37:181r-v, Hunter 1994a, 16). \nThe promise seems never to have been broken, and indeed the later\nBoyle stressed the need to have an examined faith. He pointed\nout that “usually, such as are born in such a place, espouse the\nopinions true or false, that obtain there” (BW, 12:421, Birch\n1772, VI:712), indeed, “the greatest number of those that pass\nfor Christians, profess themselves such only because Christianity is\nthe religion of their Parents, or their Country, or their Prince, or\nthose that have been, or may be, their Benefactors; which is in effect\nto say, that they are Christians, but upon the same grounds that would\nhave made them Mahometans, if they had been born and bred in\nTurky” (BP 7:233, BOA §3.7.5, pp 301–2). Boyle felt\nthat more was required of the thinking believer. Locke agreed: often a\nchild’s notion of God does more “resemble the Opinion, and\nNotion of the Teacher, than represent the True God” (Essay,\n1.14.13). \nHard on the heels of Boyle’s enlightenment, doubts about his\nfaith began to trouble\n him,[8]\n and these “distracting Doubts of some of the Fundamentals of\nChristianity” continued: “never after did these fleeting\nClouds, cease now & then to darken … the clearest serenity\nof his quiet: which made him often say that Injections of this Nature\nwere such a Disease to his Faith as the Tooth-ach is to the Body; for\ntho it be not mortall, ‘tis very troublesome” (BP 37:182r,\nHunter 1994a, 17). \nLeaving Switzerland, Boyle, along with Marcombes and his brother\ncrossed the Alps and entered Italy in September 1641 where, in\nFlorence, he spent the winter. “In Italy he read over\nthe lives of the ancient philosophers with the utmost\nattention,” presumably in Diogenes Laertius, and “[t]he\nsect, which then struck him most, was that of the Stoics; and he tried\nhis proficiency in their philosophy, by enduring a long fit of the\ntooth-ach with great\n unconcernedness.”[9]\n Still in Italy he had (in the winter of 41–42) what seems to\nhave been one of the very few sexual encounters of his life. Writing\nabout himself in the third person as Philaretus (sometimes P., or\nFilaretus) he says: \nLeaving Italy Marcombes and the two boys found on arrival in\nMarseilles that the monies the Great Earl had been in the habit of\nsending were no longer to arrive and that, indeed, the last\nquarter’s payment had been held up by Cork’s London agent.\nMoreover, there was a letter from the Earl, unaware of the mischance\naffecting the quarterly payment, telling them that, as a result of the\nrebellion in Ireland, no more money was to be forthcoming: in the\n“dangerous and poore estate whereunto by gods providence”\nhe had been reduced, he had “with much difficulty gott together\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds by selling of plate,” but to pay\nMarcombes’ bills punctually as he had in the past “I am\nnoe waies able.” So he advised Marcombes to use the money to\nbring the two boys \nIn the event Francis decided to return to Ireland, arriving in time to\nfight in the Battle of Liscarrol (September 3, 1642), at which another\nBoyle brother, Lewis, was killed. Meanwhile Robert decided that his\nhealth and lack of money ruled out a return to Ireland, and his age\nmade soldiering in Holland an untempting and indeed implausible\n prospect.[10]\n He therefore decided to accept Marcombes’ offer of hospitality\nin Geneva, and did not make his way to England until the summer of\n1644. \nBefore leaving Geneva Boyle had a conversation with François\nPerreaud (1572–1657), who later wrote Démonographie,\nou traité des démons, which Boyle then arranged to\nhave translated into English by Peter du Moulin (the younger,\n1601–1684). In a letter prefixed to the English edition Boyle\nrecalled that “the conversation I had with that pious Author\nduring my stay at Geneva, and the present he was pleased to\nmake me of this Treatise before it was printed, in a place where I had\nopportunities to enquire both after the writer, and some passages of\nthe booke, did at length overcome in me (as to this narrative) all my\nsettled indisposedness to believe strange things.” (BW 1:15)\nAcceptance of at least the possibility of diabolic or angelic\nintervention was common among the intelligentsia in the second half of\nthe seventeenth century. Cudworth pointed out one expedient reason for\nthe belief: \nIn a manuscript draft (“Loose papers whence some things are to\nbe extracted for the Discourse of the causes of Atheism”) Boyle\nconsidered three objections that might be made against such a belief:\nthe implausibility of the standard means of bringing about such\nintervention; the unreliability of the witnesses; and the\nimpossibility of incorporeal beings interacting with matter. He agrees\nthat the first objection, “urg’d with great confidence,\nand not without much show of Reason” is a strong one, but\nsuggests that “we men understand very little of the nature,\ncustomes, & government of the Intelligent creatures of the\nspirituall world: and particularly what concernes the Falne Angells or\nbad Daemons. And therefore they being themselves invisible to us, and\ncapable of working in wayes that our sences cannot discerne; and being\nAgents of great craft & long experience; tis no wonder that many\nof their actions, thô never so pollytickly contrived &\ncarried on, should seem irrationall to us: who know so little of their\nparticular inclinations & designes, and the subtil & secret\nmethods in which they carry them on.” \nThe second objection he also accepts, though not wholly:\n“thô upon particular & cogent proofe I beleeve some of\nthem to be true … yet I reject or distrust far the greatest\npart, as not being soe attested.” The third he rejects as being\nsimply inconsistent, for the human soul is accepted as incorporeal,\nand it works (though we know not how) on matter (BP 2:105, BOA\n§3.5.21, pp 257–8). \nWhen Boyle arrived back in England in mid-1644 at the age of 17 he was\nquickly reunited with his sister Katherine who seems immediately to\nhave re-adopted the semi-maternal role she had no doubt often played\nafter the death of their mother. She was concerned in a variety of\nother ways to look after his welfare, both spiritual and worldly. She\nwas, for example, the immediate cause of his getting to know the\nmembers of the Hartlib\n circle.[12] \nAt this time Boyle settled in Stalbridge (on an estate left to him by\nhis father) and occupied himself mainly in writing or planning works\nin ethics and theology. Much of his time during the early part of this\nStalbridge period was spent in moral philosophy — “My\nEthics go very slowly on,” he wrote to his sister\nKatherine on March 30, 1646 (BC 1:34) — and there was at this\nstage no reason to think that he would become one of the great natural\nphilosophers of his time. (See further, Hunter 2009, chs. 4 and 5.) He\nalready approximated to the “lay-bishop” that Aubrey,\nquoting Anthony Walker, was later to find him to be. He was, in fact,\na serious, somewhat priggish young man, though he often gave signs of\nlight-heartedness both as a boy and in later life. After his death\nGilbert Burnet claimed that “As for Joy, he had indeed nothing\nof Frolick and Levity in him,” a judgement accepted by Steven\nShapin, but this fails to allow for the lighter moments that Boyle\nundoubtedly\n enjoyed.[13] \nAt Stalbridge, about 1649, Boyle began to be interested in\nexperimenting, but was hindered by the fact that he could not obtain a\nfurnace. Stalbridge was far enough away from tradespeople who could\nmake such an item and the furnaces Boyle ordered tended to arrive\n“crumbled into as many pieces, as we into sects,” leaving\nBoyle to attempt “such experiments, as the unfurnishedness of\nthe place, and the present distractedness of my mind, will permit\nme” (BC 1:50). \nBoyle was troubled throughout his life by the fragmentation of\nChristianity. Among “the giddy multitude … this\nmultiplicity of religions will end in none at all,” he wrote to\nJohn Mallet in\n 1652,[14]\n and at the very end of his life he expressed in his Will the wish\nthat the Boyle lecturers should, when “proveing the Christian\nReligion against notorious Infidels (viz), Theists, Pagans,\nJews and Mahometans, not [descend] lower to any Controversies that are\namong Christians\n themselves.”[15] \nEventually, however, a furnace did arrive, and Boyle found himself\n“so transported and bewitch’d [as to] fancy my Laboratory\na kind of Elysium … . I there forget my Standish and my Bookes\nand allmost all things” (Boyle to Katherine Ranelagh, Aug 31,\n1649, BC 1:83). \nBoyle was never a student at a university. Nor was he ever a fellow of\nan Oxford College, though that too has been claimed on his behalf\n(Dutton 1951, 20), but it was to Oxford that he removed after his time\nat Stalbridge, and it was there that his interest in natural\nphilosophy flowered. Before taking up residence in Oxford however he\npaid two lengthy visits to Ireland during the early 50s (for a year\nfrom June 1652, and then for eight months from Oct 1653), and it was\nfrom that “illiterate country” that he wrote to Clodius,\nprobably toward the end of his second Irish visit, in the spring of\n1654: \nIt was also during this period, no doubt in large part due to\nCromwell’s extremely harsh treatment of the Irish, that\nBoyle’s Irish properties were made secure and began returning\nrents to him, ultimately reaching almost £3000 p.a., Hooke told\nAubrey. The fact that Boyle’s friend Petty conducted the survey\non which the disposal of the lands was based can hardly have been to\nBoyle’s disadvantage. \nOn October 12, 1655, Katherine was in Oxford investigating the\nsuitability of possible lodgings for Boyle. He was to lodge with the\napothecary John Crosse, whom Birch felt worthy of mention because he\nhad “a great acquaintance with Dr. John\n Fell,”[17]\n and the question was, which was the best room for his purposes, and\nhow was it to be furnished? \nThe house in question stood on the site where the Shelley Memorial now\nstands, and his two rooms there seem to have served Boyle admirably,\nthough he later set up a retreat at Stanton St John’s, where he\ncould retire when the press of society grew too great in Oxford. \nIn Oxford Boyle’s tremendous output of works in philosophy,\ntheology, and experimental philosophy began. It was here that he\npublished New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching the Spring\nof Air and its Effects, Certain Physiological Essays, The Sceptical\nChymist, Some Considerations touching the Usefulness of Experimental\nNatural Philosophy, and a number of others including The\nOrigine of Forms and Qualities. \nBoyle’s years in London (from 1668 to his death) saw the\ncontinuation of his experimental work, along with a number of works on\nphilosophy and theology, including The Excellency of Theology,\nCompar’d with Natural Philosophy, Considerations About\nthe Excellency and Grounds of the Mechanical Hypothesis, the\nFree Enquiry into the Vulgarly Receiv’d Notion of\nNature, the Discourse of things above Reason, Disquisition\nabout the Final Causes of Natural Things, and The Christian\nVirtuoso. \nIn 1691 Katherine died, and Boyle, whose health throughout his life\nhad been poor, died the following week. \nThe seventeenth century is notable not only for the number but also\nfor the variety of arguments which were offered to prove God’s\nexistence. Although writers such as Pascal and Bayle felt such\narguments to be both unnecessary and unavailable, demonstrations of\nGod’s existence were felt by many to be not only possible but\ndesirable, since they were necessary in the fight against\n atheism.[18]\n Descartes, as is well known, felt that God’s existence could\nbe, and epistemologically had to be, demonstrated, and offered a\nvariety of proofs to provide such a demonstration. His version of the\nontological argument, his proof from the supposed innate idea of God,\nhis proof from the need for an eternal conscious\n being,[19]\n and his proof from the need for continuing creation, all found\nsupporters in the later seventeenth century, though the first two were\ngenerally held to be unlikely to convince anyone. \nApart from a brief reference to it in the printed works Boyle does not\nmention the ontological argument (BW 9:413; Boyle 1772,\n4:461–2). This distancing was not uncommon at the time. Ralph\nCudworth, though clearly fascinated by the ontological argument,\nrecognized that most would “Distrust, the Firmness and\nSolidity of such thin and Subtle\nCobwebs,” and offered an alternative argument in the\nhope that it would prove more “Convictive of the\nExistence of a God to the Generality” (Cudworth 1678,\n725). \nThe language of the ontological argument was acceptable, even when the\nargument’s validity was rejected. Gassendi, for example, agreed\nthat God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived, but\ndenied the validity of the argument which offers this as its main\npremise (See further Osler 1994, ch. 2). Nor was the argument from\ninnate ideas more popular. After his dialogue character Cuphophron has\nespoused it, Henry More has his down to earth Hylobares burst out: \nBoyle, too, held that design arguments were both available and the\nmost likely to persuade rational, open-minded hearers. Such arguments\nwere intended to form a large part of a book on atheism, something he\nworked on throughout his adult life but never published, though parts\nof it were used in various other works of a theological\n nature.[21]\n Boyle did, however, leave a plan of the intended work, and in the\nmanuscript remains — seven volumes of correspondence, forty-six\nvolumes of miscellaneous papers and eighteen volumes of notebooks\n— there are still a number of unpublished fragments and some\nlonger selections which he intended for this work. \nBoyle intended “the little Tract about Atheism” to have\nthree sections: \nIn the First of these, the Author represents some Reasons why it\nshould not be thought strange if it be found somewhat difficult to\ndemonstrate the Existence of a Deity. \nIn the second section <the Author> haveing premisd, that the\nforegoing Reasons make it Equitable not to expect metaphysical or\nrigid Demonstrations of a Deity, but to be content with a moral one,\nif no better can be had, proceeds to the mediums whereof such a\nDemonstration can be made up. Such as are \nThe general Consent of mankind. (To one of which or both may be\nreferrd the Epicurean Anticipation.) \nThe Reproaches or Boadings & Disquieting Terrors of a Guilty\nConscience \nThe Fabrick & Conservation of the world, especially of Animals \nThe Nature & Propertys of the Soul of Man \nThe Lawes of its Union with the\n Body[22] \nThe Universal Providence that directs the Affairs of Mankind. \nSupernatural Effects whether of good or Evil Spirits (as their\nApparitions Action Oracles Predictions &c) \nThe Patefactions that God has made of himselfe by true miracles. (To\nwhich Prophecies are reduc’d.) \nThe Third section is spent in shewing some of the Reasons why the\nArguments proposd in the Second are often unprevalent. \nWell, that was the plan, and Boyle certainly thought that the design\narguments he intended for section two should convince the open-minded.\nMoreover, he thought, such arguments should particularly convince\nthose who were knowledgeable about nature, who knew enough about the\ndetails of the world to be impressed by the intricacy of the\npresumed workmanship. “[T]here are,” he wrote,\n“positive Reasons afforded by Philosophy to prove a Deity,\nnamely … the Cartesian Idæa, the Originall of Motion, the\nuse of Parts in Animalls, especially the Eye, the valves of the heart,\nthe musculi perforantes &\n perforati,[23]\n & the temporary\n [parts][24]\n of a foetus <& the Mother>.” \nThe argument from design, said Kant, “always deserves to be\nmentioned with respect. It is the oldest, the clearest, and the most\naccordant with the common reason of mankind” (Kant 1781,\nA623/B651). But, he pointed out, there was a problem with it, a\nproblem which in fact had already been pointed not only by David\n Hume,[25]\n but by Boyle’s younger contemporary, Charles Blount, who\nwrote, \nTo a large extent Boyle accepted these points. He notes explicitly\nthat none of the proofs he was prepared to offer amounted to a\ndemonstration of God’s existence, and indeed he felt\nthat a demonstration was not possible. A\ndemonstration was typically held to proceed from necessarily\ntrue premises (often Aristotelian\n principles[26])\n via a valid argument to a necessarily true conclusion, and part of\nwhat was at issue was whether we should be looking for a demonstration\nof God’s existence, or something less which would nonetheless\nstill be useful in the fight against atheism . “To haue the\nScience of a thing,” said Pierre du Moulin the elder, “two\ncertainties are required. The one is, that the thing be certaine of it\nselfe and vnchangeable. The second is, that the perswasion which wee\nhaue of it be firme and cleare” (Du Moulin 1624, 162). Gassendi\nagreed, as did Arnauld and Nicole in the Port Royal Logic (Gassendi\n1658, Canon XVI, 144; Arnauld 1662, part IV, ch 8, 323–4,\npagination as in the 5th, 1683 edition). \nThe persuasive alternative to a demonstration was sometimes styled a\nproof, but often people spoke of moral\ndemonstrations as opposed to strict, or mathematical, demonstrations.\nBoyle wrote: \nAnd this third kind of Probation, though it come behind the\ntwo others in certainty, yet it is the surest guide, which the\nActions of Men, though not their Contemplations,\nhave regularly allow’d them to follow (BW, 8:281; Boyle 1772,\n4:182–3). \nThis moral certainty, Locke remarked, “is not only as great as\nour frame can attain to, but as our Condition needs” (Locke\n1690, 4.11.8). \nWhen we look in detail at Boyle’s discussions of the various\nmoral demonstrations outlined in his proposed second section it\nbecomes clear that he fancied some considerably more than others. He\noften mentions the importance of conscience, but concentrates, as far\nas proofs go, on various design arguments, on arguments based on the\nincorporeality of the human soul, and on arguments involving miracles.\nUnlike the clerical authors of the time he pays little or no attention\nto the arguments from “the innate Idea of the Deity,” from\n“the general Consent of Mankind,” or from “the\nUniversal Providence that directs the Affairs of Mankind.” \nBoyle did not expect his (or anyone’s) proofs to convince most\natheists: \nBoyle was aware that most believers held their belief on insufficient\ngrounds (see BP 4:60, BOA §3.7.5, pp. 301–2), but felt\nhimself fortunate in that sound philosophy showed that the religion to\nwhich he was born was the correct one. For Boyle, miracles (in\nparticular the miracle of Pentecost) were a crucial factor in opting\nfor Christianity. The Christian miracles, he felt, clearly bore the\nstamp of God upon them. There were, he agreed, other miracles or\napparent miracles, but the miracles which purported to establish\nChristianity were neither false nor diabolical, and they were\nmiraculous. Locke believed that “Mahomet having none to produce,\npretends to no miracles for the vouching of his mission,” but\nBoyle was aware of the argument that the Koran itself is\nmiraculous (in view of the disparity between it and what might\nreasonably be expected of its author in the absence of divine\ninspiration). He felt, not that this argument was inappropriate, but\nthat it failed the test empirically: \nBoyle does not deny that the style could have been miraculous, and\nindeed he runs a formally similar argument concerning the Apostles and\nthe miracle of Pentecost: the Apostles’ “Hearers …\nknew it was <not> naturally possible, that uninspir’d\nPersons, and especially illiterate Fishermen, should <grow>\nable, in a trice, to make <weighty> discourses to many differing\nNations, in their respective Languages” (BP 7:99, BOA\n§3.6.29, p. 390). Boyle accepts, and indeed uses, the\nform of the Koran argument: it is the premise he\ndisputes. \nBoyle is ambivalent about the function of miracles. Generally he\nregards them as being philosophically relevant after we have a proof\nof God’s existence, something which natural theology will afford\nus. (Boyle fastens on two main types of design arguments: those\ninvolving the complexity of animate beings, particularly very small\nanimate\n beings,[28]\n and those which highlight the need to explain the origin and\ncontinuing function of natural laws: God must not only sustain\nGod’s creatures, Boyle argues, he must also sustain the\nregularities which we recognize as lawlike.) \nHaving convinced ourselves of God’s existence through the\nconsiderations which natural theology makes available to us, and\nrealizing that God is likely to institute a religion to make his\nnature and requirements known to us, we look to miracles to see which\ninstituted religion is the correct one. However, though in general\nBoyle argues that accepting something as a miracle\npresupposes God’s existence, and so miracles are to be\nused to institute the correct religion rather than to ground\nits metaphysical basis, he does sometimes urge an argument from\nmiracles which will yield not merely the correctness of Christianity,\nbut the acceptability of religious belief as such. Briefly: we have\ngood historical testimony for the occurrence of miracles, but miracles\nare possible only if God intervenes in nature (and thereby exists) (BP\n5:106–7, BOA §3.8.3, pp. 310–12). \nBoyle had a straightforward notion of creation. First of all God, at a\nparticular, fairly recent, point in absolute time, made matter. Boyle\nwas an admirer of “our Irish St.\nAustin”(BC 1:40), James Ussher, archbishop of Armagh,\nwho famously propounded what seems to us, though not to his\ncontemporaries, to be a very late date (4004 b.c.) for creation. Boyle\nsaw “no just reason to embrace their opinion, that would so turn\nthe two first chapters of Genesis, into an allegory, as to\noverthrow the literal and historical sense of them” and, noting\nthe implausibility of the claims of “some extravagant ambitious\nPeople, such as those fabulous Chaldeans, whose fond account\nreach’d up to 40000 or 50000 years,” held that\n“Theology teaches us, that the World is very far from being so\nold by 30 or 40 thousand years as they … have presum’d:\nand does, from the Scripture, give us such an account of the age of\nthe World, that it has set us certain Limits, within which so long a\nDuration may be bounded, without mistaking in our Reckoning. Whereas\nPhilosophy leaves us to the vastness of Indeterminate Duration,\nwithout any certain Limits at all” (BW, 8:21; Birch 1772,\nIV:11). Revelation gives us (1) truths of which we would otherwise be\nignorant, such as “the order and time of the Creation of the\nWorld and of the first man and woman”; (2) details of truths\nwhich we can otherwise obtain “but very dimly, incogently, and\ndefectively” \nAdditionally there are (3) “hints” which lead us\nto truths we would otherwise miss, such as “that whatever men\nhave generally believ’d, Vegetables had their Origine\nindependent from the Sun, the earth having producd all kinds of plants\na day before God made that Luminary” (BP 7:243, 4:15, BW\n14:271). Moreover, \nUnsurprisingly, then, Boyle makes a point of attempting to bring his\ncreation story into line with a literal interpretation of the Genesis\nstory. God, he believes, could have started things off earlier or\nlater, but chose not to. Having created matter, he broke it up and\nstarted it moving. Sometimes Boyle says he broke it up by\nstarting it\n moving.[29]Then he gave it laws, since the “casual justlings of\natoms” would not, Boyle thinks, have given rise to this\n world.[30]\n Hooke, explicating Genesis, argued for the same ordering. For Boyle\nand Hooke, that is, a world without laws is not only possible, our\nworld was such a world for a time. In the previous century Konrad\nDaspodius held that comets “drift without laws,” but by\n1686 Leibniz was writing, “God does nothing out of order, and it\nis impossible even to feign events which are not\n regular.”[31]\n Leibniz’s point was that just as any ‘random’\nsequence of points will determine a curve (actually an infinite set of\ncurves, but Leibniz only needed the lesser claim), so any sequence of\nevents will conform to a regular pattern. Generalizing, we might say\nthat just as points underdetermine equations, so facts underdetermine\ntheories. \nIt should be noted however that for Leibniz, as for a number of his\ncontemporaries, not all such laws need be laws of\n nature.[32]\n Malebranche, for example, in his Dialogues on Metaphysics,\noffered no fewer than five distinct types of law: “general laws\nof the communication of motion, … laws of the union of soul and\nbody, … laws of the union of the soul with God, with the\nintelligible substance of universal Reason, … general laws\nwhich give good and bad Angels power over bodies, … finally,\nthe laws by which Jesus Christ received sovereign power in Heaven and\non earth, over minds as well as bodies, not only to distribute\ntemporal goods … but to diffuse (répandre)\ninternal grace in our hearts” (Entretiens sur la\nMétaphysique, in Malebranche 1962,\n 12:319–320).[33] \nBoyle’s position is an intermediate one between the claim that\nsome objects or events are lawless, and the claim that lawlessness is\nimpossible. For Boyle, physical objects do exhibit nomological\nregularities, but this is a contingent fact about the world, or\nrather, for Boyle was cautious about generalizing, about the\nspatio-temporal portion of it we occupy. He agrees, however, that\nthere are laws that are not laws of nature, with the laws of\ninterconnection between body and soul providing, for him, an obvious\nexample. This interconnection also provides a clear example of a state\nwhich God constantly preserves. \nAfter having made matter, started it moving, and given it laws, God\nthen formed the matter into particular structures and shapes,\nincluding certain “seeds.” Then he added some\n“seminal principles” with formative plastic powers. Boyle\ndoes not clearly indicate whether or not these are a special subclass\nof natural laws affecting matter, or whether they are in some way what\nhe sometimes calls “supra-mechanical,” though he does\npoint out that if there is a mechanism for animal inheritance, then it\nwould seem to require a framing intelligent agent (BW, 12:445–6,\nBirch 1772, VI:728–9. See Anstey 2002a and Inglehart 2015 for a\nfull discussion of the issue.). His older contemporary Harvey, much\nadmired by Boyle, was in no doubt about the matter, pouring scorn on\nthose who talk \nAll this holds for the corporeal universe, as opposed to the three\nsorts of incorporeal creatures God created or, in our case, continues\nto create: angels, evil demons, and human souls: the good, the bad,\nand the\n imprisoned.[34]\n The angels were created “before the visible World … was\nhalf compleated,” but God creates new human souls daily, and\nmoreover works a “physical miracle” to attach them to\ntheir respective bodies (BP 7:243, 4:14, BW 14:271; BP\n 2:62).[35]\n Sometimes Boyle felt that although humans are made in God’s\nimage they, like other created beings, are “at their best but\numbratile, and Arbitrary Pictures of God their Creatour” (BP\n4:4, BOA §2.2.38, p. 145). Elsewhere, however, he offers a more\ntraditional account of the soul as the image of God: \nAlthough humans are made in the image of God, they are considerably\nless clever than the\n angels,[36]\n and since it is quite possible that God’s primary end in making\nthe universe was to provide a universe for the angels, and not\ncentrally for humans, it is thereby quite possible that the universe\nwill be too complicated for us to understand: \n“[W]e presume too much of our own abilities,” Boyle wrote,\nc. 1680, “if we imagine that the omniscient God can have no\nother Ends in the framing & managing of Things Corporeal, than\nsuch as we Men can discover” (Boyle MS 198, fol. 120, BP 7:116,\nBOA §3.6.3, p 267). It follows at once that while simplicity may\noften be our best guide as to what working hypothesis to choose, we\nshould not think it to be inevitably a reliable guide to truth. \nWhy did God create the universe in this piecemeal way? What is\nBoyle’s rationale for thinking that God didn’t just start\noff by creating matter in motion with the proper directed velocities\nand letting it give rise to the present world in its own good time? Or\nwhy not suppose that he created the present world as a going\nconcern? Boyle doesn’t tell us, but two points stand out. \nFirst of all, it certainly fits the fact that Boyle has a very limited\nview of\n omnipotence.[37]\n Here he is, for example, bemused by the swiftness of God’s\ncreative ability: \nDoing things step by step, fairly quickly, and with moderate success,\nwas quite enough to excite Boyle’s admiration for the Almighty\nand, though he had certainly read Descartes’s\nPrinciples (in which Descartes remarks explicitly that\nalthough God could have let things work their way from a very\ndifferent initial state to the present world, in fact God\nstarted the world off in medias res), it is quite possible\nthat the alternative did not strike him as likely: he was not, after\nall, a mathematician, or even a mathematical\n physicist.[39] \nGiven this, and the fact that motion was not natural to matter, but\nhad to be added to it, it would seem plausible to Boyle that God\ncreated matter first, and then gave it a push, particularly since the\npush had to be precisely fine tuned in order to yield just the world\nwe now have. (That matter is not naturally in motion forms the basis\nof one of Boyle’s criticisms of Epicurus. Boyle takes Epicurus\nto hold that motion is an innate property of matter. How\nthen, asks Boyle, are we to explain the fact that it is lost or\nchanged as a result of collision between particles? (BP 2:5, BOA\n§4.1, p 340).) Additionally, Boyle notices that no system of laws\ncan offer a complete explanation: we also need an account of the\ninitial\n parameters.[40]\n But then, since they are logically distinct, why not have them\nchronologically distinct as well? \nSecondly, there are, perhaps, historical reasons. For Boyle is\nconscious of himself as building on past views, and such views\ntypically treated matter as giving rise to the present world, and, in\nthe case of some past thinkers, at least, as having existed in a\nconstant state for some time before the initiating changes that led to\nthe present world occurred. The notion of a piecemeal creation, that\nis, fits Boyle’s views of God’s abilities, fits\nGenesis, and fits the views of previous thinkers. Probably we\ndo not need to look farther for an explanation for his adopting such a\nview. \nGod created a material world in time and space, but what kind of\nmatter, what kind of space, what kind of time? As to the matter, Boyle\nagreed with contemporaries such as Huygens and Newton that\n“Matter [is] in its own Nature but\n one.”[41]\n However Boyle, cautious as ever, explicitly allows God the\npossibility of creating matter which is not like ordinary\nmatter, and instituting laws which are quite unlike the laws that\nobtain on earth. His views are worth quoting at length: \n[T]he World must every way have bounds, and consequently be finite; or\nit must not have bounds, and so be … infinite. And if\nthe World be bounded, then those that believe a\n Deity,[42]\n to whose Nature it belongs to be of infinite Power, must not deny\nthat God was, and still\n is,[43]\n able to make other Worlds than this of ours. … \nNow if we grant, with some modern Philosophers, that God has made\nother Worlds besides this of ours, it will be highly probable that he\nhas there display’d His manifold Wisdom, in productions very\ndiffering from those wherein we here admire it. And even without\nsupposing any more than one Universe, as all that portion of it that\nis visible to us, makes but a part of that vastly extended aggregate\nof bodies: So if we but suppose, that some of the Celestial Globes,\nwhether visible to us, or plac’d beyond the reach of our sight,\nare peculiar Systemes, the consideration will not be very different.\nFor since the fix’d stars are many of them incomparably more\nremote than the Planets, ‘tis not absurd to suppose that as the\nSun, who is the fix’d star nearest to us, has a whole Systeme of\nPlanets that move about him, so some of the other fix’d Stars\nmay be each of them the Centre, as it were, of another Systeme of\nCelestial Globes … . Now, in case there be other Mundane\nSystemes (if I may so speak) besides this visible one of ours, I think\nit may be probably suppos’d that God may have given peculiar and\nadmirable instances of His inexhausted Wisedom in the Contrivance and\nGovernment of Systemes, that for aught we know may be fram’d and\nmanag’d in a manner quite differing, from what is observ’d\nin that part of the Universe that is known to us. … [H]ere on\nEarth the Loadstone is a Mineral so differing in divers affections,\nnot onely from all other Stones, but from all other bodies, that are\nnot Magnetical, that this\n Heteroclite[44]\n Mineral scarce seems to be Originary of this World of ours, but to\nhave come into it, by a remove from some other World or Systeme\n… . \nNow in these other Worlds, besides that we may suppose that\nthe Original Fabrick … into which the Omniscient Architect at\nfirst contriv’d the parts of their matter, was very differing\nfrom the structure of our Systeme; besides this, I say, we\nmay conceive that there may be a vast difference betwixt the\nsubsequent Phænomena, and productions observable in one\nof those Systemes, from what regularly happens in\nours, though we should suppose no more, than that two or\nthree Laws of Local Motion may be differing in those unknown Worlds,\nfrom the Laws that obtain in ours (BW, 10:172–3, Birch 1772,\nV:138–139). \nBoyle, that is, sees three distinct possibilities: the initial set up\nmay differ, the matter involved may differ, and the laws in question\nmay differ. Moreover the laws, as well as the matter, could have been\nformed differently by God, and could indeed vary from part to part of\nthe current universe within the universe. Clearly the case of\nvarying laws and the case of varying matter may run into each other,\nbut Boyle treats them as distinct possibilities, and gives as an\nexample the possibility of a combination of conservation and\nnon-conservation possibilities: we can envisage bodies with the\n“power of exciting Motion in another Body, without the Movents\nloosing its own.” Were this to be the case the resulting\nphenomena would be “strangely diversifyed.” Moreover, God\nmay have made a universe, or a part of this universe, which was such\nthat “some parts of matter [would] be of themselves\nquiescent … and determin’d to continue at rest\ntill some outward Agent force it into motion [while] other\nparts of the matter [may have] a Power … of restlessly moving\nthemselves, without loosing that power by the motion they excite in\nquiescent bodies. … Nor is it so extravagant a thing, as at\nfirst it may seem, to entertain such suspicions as these. For in the\ncommon Philosophy, besides that the Notion and Theory of Local Motion\nare but very imperfectly propos’d, there are Laws or Rules of it\nnot well, not to say at all,\n establish’d.”[45] \nBoyle does not use the terminology of absolute space and time, but he\nremarks that God could have made the world earlier: \nBoyle’s general view about both space and time is that since\nthey are \nHe also remarks about the world that \nMoreover, there is a \nAgain, Boyle writes: “Suppose a Ball were in motion, & all\nthe world should be on a sudden annihilated about it; why may not the\nmotion of that Ball be continu’d? there being nothing to stop\nit; & if it be continu’d, we have a motion where the mobile\ndos not quitt the neighborhood of som bodys, and approach nearer to\nothers” (BP 1:3). \nWe have, then, Boyle’s view that a body can continue “in\nthe same place precisely,” that the whole (finite)\nuniverse might move in space, and that God could have created the\nworld earlier than he did. Such views do not at least amount to a\nrejection of absolute space and time. Boyle’s\ncontemporary, Leibniz, who did reject absolute space, explicitly drew\nthe conclusion that a finite universe could not move as a\nwhole in space, and could not have been created earlier in\n time.[48] \nThe universe God created, then, contains a number of finite\nincorporeal entities, for whom the writ of physics does not\nrun, and a number of material entities, compounded as far as we are\naware, of the same matter in every case, set in a space and time\nindependent of them, and subject to a number of God given laws. \nAs for teleology, Boyle wrote an influential treatise entitled A\nDisquisition about the Final Causes of Natural Things which\nappeared in 1686. In opposition to Epicurus, he argued that there are\nfinal causes and in opposition to Descartes, he claimed that in many\ncases we can have epistemic access to these final causes, though he\nagreed that we ought not be presumptuous in these matters. According\nto Boyle, there are four types of final cause that we can know. First,\nthere are the “grand and General Ends of the whole World, such\nas the Exercising and Displaying the Creators immense Power\n….” Second, are the ends in the nature and motions of the\ncelestial objects and the Earth. Third, there are the ends that\npertain to the parts of animals and fourth there are human ends (BW,\n11:87). Boyle was quite adamant that there are no ends that pertain to\ninanimate objects. In particular, he rejects any form of immanent\nteleology in virtue of which material objects are able to direct their\nbehaviour: “For inanimate Agents act not by choice, but by a\nnecessary impulse, and not being endow’d with Understanding and\nWill, cannot of themselves be able to moderate or to suspend their\nactions” (BW, 4:267. See Carlin 2011, 2012). \nOn a number of occasions Boyle assures us that “God [is] the\nAuthor of the universe & free Establisher of the Laws of motion,\nwhose generall Concourse is necessary to the conservation &\nEfficacy of every particular Physicall Agent” (BP 2:132). The\ntrouble is, he seems to have thought that this remark was fairly\ntransparent, and does not trouble to explain it to us. Moreover, he\ntends to use much the same phraseology on each occasion he discusses\nthe issue. It was a commonplace of the time that Boyle was no stylist\n— it was obvious at times to Boyle himself — but though\neven the obsequious Budgell remarked that Boyle was “too wordy\nand prolix,” in this case at least he was not wordy enough\n(Budgell 1732, 124). \nIt is tempting to suppose that Boyle must have had some reasonably\nwell thought out views on the question of how God sustains\nthe world. He was after all one of the most impatient of thinkers when\nit came to fake or non-explanations, and he was in general very aware\nof the danger of letting verbal ‘explanations’ get in the\nway of real ones. He objected against the scholastics, for example\nthat \nOn the other hand, in theology he was more likely than elsewhere to\nlet things get by, since he was convinced in advance that his\ntheological picture was the right one, and he was used to stifling\ndoubts about theological claims. Writing about himself in the third\nperson as a young man he speaks of the “fleeting Clouds”\nof doubts which never ceased “now & then to darken /obscure/\nthe clearest serenity of his quiet: which made him often say that\nInjections of this Nature were such a Disease to his Faith as the\nTooth-ach is to the Body; for tho it be not mortall, ‘tis very\ntroublesome” (BP 37:182r). (These doubts persisted: see Hunter\n1990, 410.) \nMoreover, he had a well worked out doctrine concerning the limitations\nof reason, and often points out that we should not expect fully to\nunderstand God’s workings, for God is, after all, “<a\nBeing> of a most Primary and most singular Nature” (BP 2:107,\n2:37, BOA § 4.1, p 357). (For different interpretations of Boyle\non the limits of reason see Wojcik 1997, Holden 2007 and Marko 2014.)\nFurthermore, he was willing to admit the impossibility of our\nunderstanding — at least given the present limitations on our\nintellects — even quite ordinary and lawlike matters, e.g., the\nway in which the human soul and human body interact. How God could\nhave created the world, and how it is that he can intervene in it, are\nmatters as mysterious to us as how mind and body can interact, and\nthat is a total mystery. \nSometimes, Boyle remarks, our ignorance of things has to do simply\nwith our lack of knowledge of the inner or hidden workings of a thing.\nHe offers his, and indeed the century’s, standard example of\nclocks which may have various internal mechanisms to produce the same\nouter effects. Thus he remarks that “we know in general, that\ndigestion is made by some Menstruum or subtile substance in\nthe Stomach; thô we know not the particular nature of that\nsubstance, (as whether it be Acid, Urinous, &c.)”.\nSometimes, though, our ignorance is of a deeper, richer variety: \nBoyle was impatient with the Cartesian suggestion that we might be\nable to alter the direction though not the quantity of motion, not for\nLeibniz’s reason that the notion of quantity of motion required\na confusion between momentum and kinetic\n energy,[50]\n but for the straightforward reason that interfering with the directed\nvelocity required as mysterious an interaction as altering the\n‘quantity of motion’ would. He was aware of the Cartesian\nclaim “that the rational Soul doth [not] give any motion to the\nparts of the Body, but only guide or regulate that\nwhich she finds in them already” (BW, 9:379, Birch 1772,\nIV:416), but that, he felt, did not really solve the problem, for that\ninteraction was as mysterious as an energy introducing one: “I\ndo as little conceive how the motions of the Conarion can\nwork upon an Immaterial soul, as how any other part of the Body can do\nit. Nor do I conceive how an Immaterial Soul can work upon the\nConarion its self, more then it can upon any other part of\nthe Body” (BP 1:128 BOA §3.5.15, p 253), and he notes that\nit will not “suffice to object, that the human will does, in\nthese cases, not produce any new motion, but only determine[s] the\nmotions of the spirits, and by their means of the locomotive organs.\nFor to put a check, at pleasure, to the motion of a body, that does\nalready actually move in one line, and determine its motion to\ncontinue in another, that is perhaps differing from it, or even\nopposite to it; to do this, I say, without opposing to the moving\nbody, some other body, which, by its resistance and situation may\nchange its former course, is not a mechanical operation” (BW,\n12:480, Birch 1772, VI:756). A change of direction, just as much as a\nchange in the ‘quantity of motion,’ is in fact as\nmysterious and inexplicable, if done by incorporeal means, as the\nintroduction of energy into the system would be. \nMany of us learned at school that Boyle’s Law holds for ideal\ngases and can be summarized as PV = k, where k is a constant, and P\nand V are pressure and volume respectively. This law does stem from\nBoyle’s work, but it is not what Boyle took himself to have\n demonstrated.[51] \nBoyle was arguing specifically against a Jesuit scientist, Franciscus\nLinus, who claimed, not that ordinary atmospheric air does not have\nany pressure (a spring), but that its pressure was not sufficiently\npowerful for it to do all the things it does in fact do. So Boyle\ndecided on an experiment to show the way in which, as we would say,\nthe pressure and the volume of the air vary, when the air is, in\nBoyle’s words, either ‘compressed or dilated.’ \nHe and his assistant, at the time Robert Hooke, made a J shaped tube\nand began to make a few measurements, but “were hindered from\nprosecuting the trial at that time by the casual breaking of the\ntube.” \nSubsequently they made another, larger, better piece of apparatus, and\ntaking particular care that the measurements should be accurate,\ntested the hypothesis “that supposes the pressures and\nexpansions to be in reciprocal proportion.” The results are set\nout, with misprints, in two tables, and Boyle’s conclusion was\nthat the experimental findings matched the predicted results very well\nin the case of compression, less well in the case of rarefaction.\nBoyle suggested that the divergence from the expected result in the\ncase of rarefaction may have been due to “some little aerial\nbubbles in the quicksilver” (“so easy is it in such nice\nexperiments to miss of exactness,” he added). \nNow, what did Boyle take himself to have shown? First, that there is,\nas a matter of experimental fact, a spring to the air: this is not in\nthe sense in which Boyle understands the term, any longer an\nhypothesis: it is now obvious from the experimental results: what\nexplains, or purports to explain this fact will be a theory or an\nhypothesis, but the result itself is in no sense an hypothesis. As\nBoyle said \nSecondly, Boyle takes himself to have shown that, for atmospheric air,\nwithin the limits of his experimental set-up, “the pressures and\nexpansions [are] in reciprocal proportion,” or, as we would say,\npressure and volume vary inversely. He doesn’t take himself to\nhave shown anything more than this. He does remark that further\nexperiments may show that the relationship holds outside the boundary\nconditions imposed by the experimental set-up, but the experiments he\nhas just made certainly don’t show that. What Boyle expressly\nsaid was, \nThus Boyle’s Law, for Boyle, was not a universal generalization\nabout ideal gases: it was a strictly limited claim about common or\natmospheric air. Boyle did add that “there is no cause to doubt,\nthat if we had been here furnished with a greater quantity of\nquicksilver and a very strong tube, we might, by a further compression\nof the included air, have made it counter balance the pressure of a\nfar taller and heavier cylinder of mercury.” \nBut he did not claim that the same ratio between pressure and volume\nwould hold in such more extreme cases. Nor did he claim that there are\nno limits to the possible compression. It is worth stressing that\nBoyle had this limited view of his result, for Shapin and Schaffer\n1985 suggest that \nBut Boyle was quite happy not to draw such conclusions, simply because\nhis experiments didn’t allow that kind of jump. There are other\nimportant ways in which he thought that generalizations about nature\nmight fail of universality. He had a very healthy notion of the\ncomplexity of the world, and an acute sense of the difficulties to\nwhich even apparently simple experiments could give rise. In fact,\nBoyle had was one of the first philosophers ever to develop a\nphilosophy of experiment. \nBoyle was one of the first philosophers to develop a philosophy of\nexperiment. His view, which derived in part from Francis Bacon, has\nmany parallels with that of his fellow experimenter Robert Hooke and\nthis Bacon-Boyle-Hooke philosophy of experiment came to exert great\ninfluence on the development of natural philosophy in the late\nseventeenth century (Anstey 2014). \nBoyle’s view of experiment is best understood in the context of\nthe newly emerging experimental philosophy of the early Royal Society\nof London in the early 1660s and its precursor groups in Oxford in the\nlate 1650s. At this time the discipline of natural philosophy was\nshifting from being regarded as a speculative science, like, say,\ntheology, to being an operative or practical science in which\nexperiments played a central role. \nThe first tenet of Boyle’s philosophy of experiment is that\nobservation and experiment should have epistemic priority over theory.\nThat is, one should accept only those principles and axioms in natural\nphilosophy that are based upon sufficient observational and\nexperimental evidence and one should avoid constructing a theory\nwithout recourse to observation and experiment. Speculative philosophy\ncommences with principles that are accepted without recourse to\nexperiment, whereas experimental philosophy begins with observation\nand experiment and only then proceeds to theory. \nSecondly, Boyle believes that although one should not start\none’s inquiries from untested principles, one can nevertheless\nreason upon experiments: \nIt is hardly surprising then to find that Boyle wrote quite\nextensively on the relation between experimental philosophy and\nspeculative philosophy and on the usefulness of reason to the\nexperimental philosopher. For example, in a catalogue of his\nunpublished works dating from 1684 there is listed a work entitled\n“Of Usefulnes of Speculative & Experimental Philosophy to\none another” (BW, 14:342). Unhappily this work is no longer\nextant. \nThirdly, according to Boyle, once a theory is constructed, the natural\nphilosopher should be prepared to revise it in the light of new\nexperimental evidence: “I would have such kind of\nsuperstructures look’d upon only as temporary ones\n…” (BW, 2:14). The only things that Boyle will remain\ncertain of are matters of fact: “I dare speak confidently and\npositively of very few things, except Matters of Fact” (BW,\n2:19). \nFourthly, while Boyle believed in ultimate causes underlying natural\nphenomena, he also acquiesced in Bacon’s conception of a scale\nof causes and the need to discover intermediate causes en route\nto ultimate explanations: \nOne such intermediate cause that was of great importance for Boyle is\nthe spring (or pressure) of the air (see Anstey 2002b; Chalmers 2012).\nBoyle was aware that this quality was not one of those causes\n“that are the highest in the scale or series of Causes”\n(BW, 2:21), and that he had to be content with its intermediate\nstatus. \nThis cluster of doctrines about experiment was set in Boyle’s\nwritings within a broader Baconian context, namely the Baconian method\nof natural history. Baconian natural histories were, in the first\ninstance, vast collections of matters of fact derived from observation\nand experiment and which were to provide the foundation for natural\nphilosophical theorising. (In fact, few natural philosophers were able\nto respect this two-stage process.) They are to be distinguished from\nclassificatory natural history that was concerned with describing and\nclassifying natural kinds (Ogilvie 2006). Thus, many of Boyle’s\nactual experimental reports are found in works that are natural\nhistories after the style of Francis Bacon. For example, Boyle viewed\nhis famous air-pump experiments that led eventually to the discovery\nof Boyle’s Law, as part of a broader natural history of the air.\nIndeed, the philosopher John Locke, who was also committed to the\nBaconian method of natural history, edited Boyle’s General\nHistory of the Air and saw it through the press the year after\nBoyle died. \nThere are two important implications for Boyle’s philosophy of\nexperiment that derive from the natural historical context in which it\nwas set. First, it accounts for the fact that many of Boyle’s\nexperiments were almost completely divorced from theory – they\nwere experiments that “had a life of their own,” –\nto use Ian Hacking’s felicitous phrase (Hacking 1983, chapter\n9). Secondly, the natural historical context helps to explain the very\nrich typology of experiments that Boyle used. Boyle followed Bacon in\ndistinguishing between luciferous (light-bearing) experiments that\nrevealed underlying causes and fructiferous (fruit-bearing)\nexperiments, that produced useful knowledge and technologies. This\ndistinction was widely used in the seventeenth century. Another type\nof experiment that derives from Bacon, was named by Boyle and was made\nfamous by Newton. This was the crucial experiment (experimentum\ncrucis) (BW, 3:50–1). \nHe also coined the term ‘exploratory experiment’ to\ndescribe a form of experimentation that includes ‘The devising\nof New and convenient Tools or other Instruments for altering the\nusual State or the common course of things, and for thereby reducing\nnature to vary her Course and afford the Enquirers some new\nPhaenomena’ (BP, 9:52). This is clearly a precursor of the\nmodern notion of exploratory experiment (Steinle 2016). \nBoyle was fully aware that some of the central tenets of his view of\nexperiments and his own natural historical methodology derived from\nthe writings of Francis Bacon. But he did not believe that Bacon was\nthe first to practise experimental philosophy. Interestingly, Boyle\nbelieved that his approach to natural philosophy found precedents in\nsome of the presocratic philosophers, such as the Greek atomist\nDemocritus and the (shadowy) Phoenician Moschus whom he surmised were\nexperimental corpuscularians (Levitin 2014). \nTwo distinct notions of the soul occupied centre stage in the\nseventeenth century. One, stemming from Plato and the Pythagoreans,\nwith theological trimmings by Augustine, had been given immense\nprestige by Descartes’ championing of it. This view was what\nGeach has called the “savage superstition … that a man\nconsists of two pieces, body and soul, which come apart at\ndeath.” Geach adds, “the superstition is not mended but\nrather aggravated by conceptual confusion, if the soul-piece is\nsupposed to be immaterial” (Geach 1969, 38). \nThe second main account, stemming from Aristotle, had been taken over\nand made Christian by St Thomas\n Aquinas.[52]\n In this account the soul was, though incorporeal, not simply a\nseparate bit attached to the body, but was the form of the individual\nanimal in question, whether human or not. Aquinas presented arguments\nto show that human souls were subsistent in view of various capacities\nthey had, and proceeded from there to argue for the possibility of the\ncontinuing existence of human souls in the absence of the body. He\nwas, however, clear that the human person (even when the person in\nquestion was Christ in human form) was not merely a soul with an\nattached body, but was the body informed by the soul: if your soul\nalone were to survive death you would not. Bodily resurrection is\nessential to the survival and immortality of humans. \nCartesians and Thomists alike believed on scriptural grounds that\nthere were actual cases of separated souls, namely, the angels, fallen\nand unfallen, so the possibility that the human soul might itself be\nsubsistent was simply the possibility that it might sufficiently\nresemble an already accepted ontological group: despite the problems\nthat substance dualism raises, a number of which presented themselves\nclearly to Boyle, there was no general problem concerning\nincorporeal entities, and there were, Boyle felt, strong arguments for\nthe incorporeality of the human soul. \nFor Boyle, as for other leading seventeenth century figures,\nperception was a matter of information entering the brain as a result\nof causal interaction between the perceiver and the perceived object.\nArriving at the brain the information was processed by a subsystem or\nset of subsystems devoted to presenting it to the cognitive system,\nand to storing it thereafter. The initial processing was done by a\nsystem, the common sense, that combined the inputs from the\nvarious sense organs (left eye + right eye; eyes + ears; etc.) and it\nwas then imagined — that is, an image was formed in the\nbrain though, as Kepler and Descartes noted explicitly, the image was\nnot a literal, optical, image. That apart, seventeenth century\nthinkers accepted in general outline the position which had already\nbeen set out in the thirteenth century by Roger Bacon, who was in turn\nsimply collating the views of earlier Islamic writers on the subject,\nthough of course the details, particularly the details of the causal\ninteraction between percipient and perceived, varied from writer to\nwriter (See further Lindberg 1976, MacIntosh 1983, and Sutton\n1998). \nImagination was a matter of material images being formed in the brain.\nBut, it was held by Boyle and others, we have knowledge of things\nwhich are literally unimaginable — that is, they cannot be\naccurately represented by a corporeal image in the central nervous\nsystem. There were a variety of reasons for this belief. First it was\nheld that there were things which were too large, and things which\nwere too small to be imagined, that is, imaged. Hence some\nnon-material faculty was needed to account for this ability.\nAdditionally, there are things which are not image-able because they\ncannot be represented accurately by any physical system.\nBoyle’s stock example in this area, though not his only example,\nis the incommensurability of the sides and diagonal of a square. Since\n√2 is irrational no discrete (corpuscular) system can accurately\nrepresent both. But we do have knowledge of squares. Therefore we must\nbe employing a non-material system. Also, there were things such as\nDescartes’ chiliagon which, while they could be represented\nphysically, could not (as experience shows) be represented accurately\nby our physical imaging system. \nAdditionally (a familiar Aristotelian point), our ability to abstract\n— to consider universals and not merely particular instances\n— was held to provide further evidence for the incorporeality of\nthe soul and hence for the possibility at least of human\nimmortality. \nBoyle also noted, as did his contemporary Henry More, the Cambridge\nPlatonist, the occurrence of ecstasies. Boyle, like More, took the\nexistence of ecstasies seriously and, accepting the literal meaning of\nthe term, thought that such experiences showed the actuality of\nnon-corporeal, out-of-body, experiences. Boyle indeed offers the case\nas a refutation of the Aristotelian view that images are required for\nhuman thinking. Locke was more cautious on the issue: “whether\nthat, which we call Extasy, be not dreaming with the Eyes\nopen, I leave to be\n examined.”[53] \nThus, for Boyle, souls were almost certainly Cartesian souls, though\nas mentioned earlier he hesitates about whether or not the human soul\nmay not be a substantial form (BW, 5:300, Birch 1772, III:12). \nGiven that souls are incorporeal adjuncts of the body, it follows that\nthey are not materially destructible, and that the laws of\ninteraction between soul and body are not laws of natural philosophy.\nWhy grass looks green is a feature of the world which God\ndecided upon and upholds. His reasons for this decision, says Boyle,\nwere no doubt weighty, but they are, as to us, arbitrary (see, e.g.,\nBP 2:62, BOA §3.5.1, p 247; 2:105, BOA 3.5.21, p 258; 9:40;\n36.46v). Now, if our souls are non-material, that demolishes at least\none philosophical barrier to a belief in an after-life such as is\npromised by Christianity.
