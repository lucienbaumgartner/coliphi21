People sometimes wonder, for example, if it would have\nbeen wrong to break certain promises that they in fact kept. Examples\nlike this do not exhaust the significance of possibility—or\nmodality more generally—in our ethical thinking. Rather, we also\nseem to be committed to a certain modal structure in our ethical\ncommitments. To see this, consider an example. Suppose that a bank\nmanager wrongfully embezzles their client’s money. If we imagine\nholding fixed how much the bank manager stole, and how; the trust\ntheir customers placed in them; what they did with the money; all of\nthe short- and long-term consequences of their actions; and so on, it\nseems that there could not be a second action that perfectly resembled\nthis embezzlement, except that the second action was right rather than\nwrong. Cases like this one seem to show a necessary\nconnection: they suggest that the ethical character of the bank\nmanager’s act cannot vary without some other facts varying as\nwell.\n\n\nWhile the embezzling bank manager example concerns a specific\nnecessary connection, many philosophers also find it plausible that\nthere are general necessary connections between ethical\nproperties and certain other properties. For example, many\nphilosophers have been inclined to accept:\n\n\nInitial\n\nThere can be no ethical difference between two possible states of\naffairs or actions without there being some natural difference between\nthem.\n\n\n\nFollowing R. M. Hare (1952), claims of such general necessary\nconnection are called ethical supervenience theses. Such\ntheses have played a key role in arguments for and against a variety\nof influential views about ethics. This entry aims to introduce the\nidea of ethical supervenience and its philosophical significance. The\nentry considers ways of making more precise the claim that the ethical\nsupervenes, and what case can be made for the supervenience of the\nethical. It then considers arguments that use ethical supervenience as\na premise, and doubts that ethical supervenience has the sort of\nsignificance suggested by these arguments.\n\nMany philosophers hope to make significant arguments about ethics\nusing ethical supervenience as a premise. However, there are many\ndistinct ethical supervenience theses that philosophers might be\ninterested in. Understanding the differences between these theses can\nhelp to clarify which of them deserve our allegiance. It is also\nimportant because different supervenience theses will support quite\ndifferent arguments about ethics. \nTo begin, it is worth briefly characterizing certain core features of\nsupervenience relations, as they are now standardly understood in\nmetaphysics (see, e.g., the entry on\n supervenience).\n Supervenience relations are typically understood as relations between\npairs of classes of properties. Consider the claim that a certain\nclass of properties—the A-properties—cannot vary\nwithout the B-properties also varying. In this claim, we can\ncall the A-properties the supervening properties, and\nthe B-properties the subvening or base\nproperties. \nSupervenience relations are covariance relations that have\nthree logical features: they are reflexive, transitive, and\nnon-symmetric. The claim that supervenience is reflexive\nmeans that every set of properties supervenes on itself: for any class\nof properties A, there can be no difference in the\nA-properties without a difference in the A-properties.\nThe claim that supervenience is transitive means that: if the\nA-properties supervene on the B-properties, and the\nB-properties supervene on the C-properties, then the\nA-properties supervene on the C-properties. The claim\nthat supervenience is non-symmetric means that supervenience\nis compatible with either symmetry (A supervenes on B\nand B supervenes on A; as in the case of the ethical and\nitself) or asymmetry (A supervenes on B but B\ndoes not supervene on A; as may be the case between the\nbiological and the microphysical). \nThese claims reflect how use of the word ‘supervenience’\nhas come to be usefully regimented in contemporary metaphysics. It is\nworth emphasizing this point, because there is a significant history\nof the word being used in ways that depart from this contemporary\northodoxy. For example, for a time it was quite common both in\nmetaphysics and in ethics for ‘supervenience’ to be used\nto mark an asymmetrical dependence relation. Such uses are, however,\ninconsistent with the contemporary regimentation. This is a point\nabout terminological clarity, not a substantive barrier to discussing\nsuch asymmetric relations. For example, one could name the asymmetric\nrelation that holds when A supervenes on B but B\ndoes not supervene on A. Or one could name the relation that\nholds when the supervenience of A on B is accompanied by\nan adequate explanation. One influential variant of the latter sort of\nexplanatory relation has been dubbed ‘superdupervenience’\n(Horgan 1993, 566). More recently, many philosophers have suggested\nthat a certain asymmetric dependence\nrelation—grounding—is of central importance to\nour metaphysical theorizing. (For discussion, see the entry on\n metaphysical grounding.) \nGiven the standard contemporary regimentation, however, supervenience\nclaims state a certain pattern of covariation between classes\nof properties, they do not purport to explain that pattern,\nas a grounding or superdupervenience thesis would (compare DePaul\n1987). This point is crucial to several arguments from ethical\nsupervenience, as we will see below. \nThese clarifying remarks put us in a position to introduce four\ncentral questions that can be used to develop alternative\nsupervenience theses: \nThe next four subsections consider these questions in turn. Before\nturning to these questions, it is worth briefly highlighting a\ndifferent issue: which class of supervening properties to focus on? A\nsurvey of the literature provides a variety of suggestions: relevant\nsupervening properties are characterized as ethical,\nmoral, evaluative, or normative. The nature\nof each of these categories, and the relationship between them, are\nboth controversial. For example, some philosophers will question the\nnormative authority of morality, while others will think of\nnormativity as a very broad tent, including any rule- or\nconvention-governed activity, such as chess or etiquette. This entry\nwill not explore these interesting issues (see Baker 2017 for\ndiscussion). Instead, it will provisionally assume that the\nsignificance of supervenience is similar for each of these classes of\nproperties. For the sake of uniformity, the entry will focus on\nethical properties throughout. \nSomewhat surprisingly, the idea of ethical supervenience can be made\nto seem plausible despite the fact that it is difficult to provide a\ncharacterization of what the ethical supervenes on that is at\nonce uncontroversial and theoretically interesting (see\n Section 5.4\n for further discussion of this point). This section briefly sketches\nthe options for characterizing what the ethical supervenes on, and\nsome difficulties that these options face. \nThe thesis used to introduce supervenience\nabove—Initial—suggested that the ethical supervenes on the\nnatural properties. This is the most common way of\ncharacterizing ethical supervenience in the literature. However, there\nare at least two difficulties with this idea. The first difficulty is\nambiguity: the term ‘natural’ has been characterized in\nwildly varying terms in metaethics (see the introductory section of\nthe entry on\n moral non-naturalism\n for a brief survey of characterizations of the natural; see McPherson\n2015, §3–4 for one constructive proposal). The second\ndifficulty is that on many conceptions of the natural there will be\ncounterexamples to Initial. For example, many philosophers want to\ncontrast natural properties with supernatural\nproperties. Even if we assume that there are no actually instantiated\nsupernatural properties, we might allow that such entities are\npossible. But this might in turn seem to suggest that two\npossible states of affairs could be naturalistically identical, but\nethically different. For example, they might be different because of\nethically significant interactions between supernatural beings (Klagge\n1984, 374–5; for some complications see McPherson 2015,\n134–5). \nThis sort of worry might lead one to reject the common assumption that\nthe ethical supervenes on the natural as misguided; instead,\none might propose that the ethical supervenes on the\nnon-ethical. This might seem promising: the point of the\nembezzling bank manager case might seem to be that there would need to\nbe some non-ethical difference between cases—natural or\nnot—in order for there to be an ethical difference in the bank\nmanager’s actions. However, there is an important worry about\nthis way of characterizing the supervenience base (compare Sturgeon\n2009, 70–72), which can be brought out briefly by example. Some\nphilosophers are sympathetic to ambitious reductive hypotheses about\nethics. On one such example, the ethical property of goodness is just\nidentical to the property of pleasantness. Because identicals have all\nof the same properties, this would entail that pleasantness is an\nethical property. Some philosophers also think that certain\nexperiential or “phenomenal” properties, such as\npleasantness, are metaphysically fundamental, such that two possible\ncircumstances could differ only in how much pleasantness they\ncontained. Together, the points entail the conclusion that two worlds\ncould differ from each other solely in an ethical respect: how much\ngoodness/pleasantness they include. This is inconsistent with the\nsupervenience of the ethical on the non-ethical, but it is not clear\nthat we should be prepared to dismiss out of hand the assumptions that\ngenerate this conclusion. This might in turn lead us to think that\nthere can at least be reasonable controversy concerning the\nsupervenience of the ethical on the non-ethical. \nOne can avoid this problem by proposing that the ethical supervenes on\nthe distribution of all of the properties. But this\nformulation purchases plausibility at the price of triviality. Ethical\ndifferences are differences, so there can obviously be no ethical\ndifference without some difference. In light of its\ntriviality, this sort of supervenience thesis fails to identify\nanything in ethical supervenience that is of philosophical\ninterest. \nAn influential alternative way of characterizing what the ethical\nsupervenes on begins with a distinction in language. Some philosophers\nthink that we can intuitively distinguish between broadly\nevaluative predicates (like ‘is right’, ‘is\ngood’, ‘is virtuous’, etc.) from\ndescriptive predicates (like ‘is round’,\n‘is accelerating’, ‘is a badger’ etc.). We can\nthen ask about the relationship between the properties that are picked\nout by these two sets of predicates. Frank Jackson has argued that\nthis allows us to state an ethical supervenience thesis: there is no\npossible difference that can be stated using evaluative predicates\nbetween states that are identical with respect to all properties\npicked out by descriptive predicates (1998, 118–125). \nJackson’s proposal seemingly avoids triviality, because\nevaluative and descriptive predicates appear to be distinct. However,\nthe detour through language faces significant challenges. One\nchallenge concerns the expressive power of a language like ours: if it\nis limited, then there seemingly might be ethical differences between\nstates of affairs that are not correlated with descriptive differences\nexpressible in a language like ours (for related worries, see Sturgeon\n2009, 73–79). A second challenge questions whether the\ndistinction between description and evaluation is characteristically a\ndistinction in the semantic properties of predicates, as Jackson\nassumes. On one contrasting view, evaluation might instead\ncharacteristically be a pragmatic property of whole speech acts (see\nVäyrynen 2013b for extended defense of this idea for the case of\n“thick” evaluation.) \nIn the face of these difficulties, some philosophers have sought to\ndevelop accounts of the class of properties which subvene the ethical\nwhich are substantive enough for ethical supervenience to do\ndialectical work, but avoid some of the difficulties just sketched.\nFor example, it has been proposed that the ethical supervenes on the\ndisjunctive class of non-ethical or descriptive properties\n(Ridge 2007). In the context of discussing arguments concerning\nsupervenience and non-naturalism, it has been proposed that the\nethical supervenes on the set of properties that are not ethical\nproperties as those are understood by the non-naturalist (McPherson\n2012). \nThere is a cross-cutting distinction that may be important for our\nthinking about the supervenience of the ethical. Most properties are\nrepeatable, in the sense that they can be possessed by\ndistinct possible individuals. But some properties are not repeatable.\nFor example, the property of being identical to Emad Atiq is\nnot repeatable: it can only be borne by a single individual, across\nmodal space. It appears plausible that the ethical properties\nsupervene on a set of repeatable properties (Atiq forthcoming).  \nAs this brief survey makes clear, it is not obvious how to\ncharacterize what the ethical supervenes on, in a way that makes an\nethical supervenience thesis both plausible and theoretically\ninteresting. Now that the difficulties here have been made clear\n(especially by Sturgeon 2009), this is an important potential locus\nfor future research. The following discussion largely sets aside these\ndebates, speaking of the supervenience of the ethical properties on\nthe base properties,where ‘base’ serves as a\nplaceholder for a more illuminating characterization of the class of\nproperties that subvene the ethical. \nThere are many possible structures of covariation that have been\ncalled supervenience theses in the metaphysics literature. For our\npurposes, it will be convenient to distinguish four of the most\ninfluential formulations. (The literature on supervenience contains\nseveral other variations; see the entry on\n supervenience\n for an excellent introduction, from which this entry adopts some of\nthe formulations below. That entry also has very helpful discussion of\nthe contrast between supervenience and certain other metaphysical\nrelations with which it is often associated. The contrast between\nsupervenience and the closely-related notion of entailment, discussed\nin section 3.2 of the entry on\n supervenience,\n is especially germane to the topic of this subsection.) \nOne important structural distinction concerns whether a thesis makes\nclaims about the properties of individuals (individual\nsupervenience theses), or is cast in terms of the character of whole\npossible worlds (global supervenience theses). The ethical\nproperties globally supervene on the base properties just in\ncase: \nIndividual supervenience theses are so-called because they explicitly\nstate patterns of instantiation of properties by individuals\n(rather than across whole possible worlds). There are two prominent\nsorts of individual supervenience theses in the literature. The\nethical properties weakly supervene on the base properties\njust in case: \nThe ethical properties strongly supervene on the base\nproperties just in case: \nThe crucial difference between Strong and Weak supervenience is the\nsecond necessity operator in Strong. An example will make the\ndifference here vivid: weak ethical supervenience is compatible with\nit being a brute fact that there are both “utilitarian”\npossible worlds where rightness covaries uniformly with happiness\nmaximization, and “Kantian” possible worlds, where\nrightness covaries uniformly with satisfying the categorical\nimperative. By contrast, strong supervenience denies this\npossibility. \nIt is generally agreed that strong supervenience entails global\nsupervenience and weak supervenience; there is considerable\ncontroversy about whether global supervenience entails strong\nsupervenience (see §4.3 of the entry on\n supervenience). \nConsider another important individual ethical supervenience relation,\ninspired by Brian McLaughlin (1995, 24) but stated less\ntechnically: \nIf we interpret ‘possible’ here as representing\nmetaphysical modality, both McLaughlin and Jaegwon Kim (1993, 81) note\nthat the Strong and Strong Intuitive supervenience relations are\nequivalent. However,\n Section 2\n below will show that if we reinterpret the modalities involved, these\ntheses will no longer be equivalent. \nSo far this entry has talked freely of necessity, possibility, and\npossible worlds. However, one can use such talk to discuss importantly\ndifferent modal standards: for example, philosophers talk of\nlogical necessity, conceptual necessity,\nmetaphysical necessity, nomic necessity, and\nnormative necessity. The aim of this section is to briefly\norient readers to each of these notions. To begin, consider some\nexamples: \nOn one traditional gloss, a sentence is logically necessary\nif it would remain true given any uniform and grammatically legitimate\nreinterpretation of the non-logical expressions of that sentence.\nSentence (1) is a promising example: the only non-logical word in (1)\nis ‘bachelor’, and any uniform and grammatically\nappropriate interpretation of ‘bachelor’ in (1) will\nresult in a true sentence. (For more on logical truths, see the entry\non\n logical truth.\n Section 1.1 of that entry discusses the alleged modal force of\nlogical truths.) \nBy contrast, (2) is not a logical truth: one could easily hold fixed\nits logical structure, but vary the meaning of ‘bachelor’\nor ‘unmarried’ and thereby produce a false sentence.\nHowever, (2) is a promising candidate to be conceptually necessary. On\none gloss, a sentence is conceptually necessary (or\n“analytically true”) if it is true solely in virtue of the\nmeanings or concepts involved in the sentence. Sentence (2) is a\ntraditional example. If ‘bachelor’ means unmarried\nmale, then the meaning of the sentence suffices to explain why it\nis true. (The notion of analyticity is famously controversial; for\ndiscussion, see the entry on the\n analytic-synthetic distinction.) \nTwo notes are relevant here. First, some philosophers will talk of\n‘logical’ necessity or supervenience as a way of\ndiscussing what this entry is calling conceptual necessity or\nsupervenience. Here, as elsewhere, it is important to keep track of\nwhat exactly an author intends to express by their terms. Second, some\nproponents of analytic truth will nonetheless reject the idea of a\ndistinct conceptual modality (e.g. Jackson 1998, Ch. 3). Such\nphilosophers can, however, capture importantly related phenomena by\ndiscussing modal claims formulated in terms of sentences and their\nintensions. \nNext consider (3): this does not seem to be true simply because of the\nconcepts it expresses. Rather, if it is true, it seems to reflect an\nimportant law of nature: a deep and non-accidental pattern in our\nuniverse. Some philosophers think that such laws underwrite a\ndistinctive sort of modality: a proposition is nomically\nnecessary just in case its falsity is incompatible with the laws\nof nature. On this view, (3) is nomically necessarily true, because it\nfollows from the laws governing the speed of light. \nNow consider (4). It is commonly thought that (4) is necessarily true.\nFor example: a substance composed overwhelmingly of atoms that do not\ncontain 79 protons in their nuclei could not be gold. But (4) does not\non its face look like a conceptual truth: it was a substantive\ndiscovery that there were protons at all, let alone how many protons\nan atom of gold characteristically possesses. Further (4) does not\nseem like it reflects a law of nature in the way that (3) does:\nrather, (4) seems to follow immediately from facts about what it is to\nbe gold. Examples like (4) thus purport to give us an initial grasp on\nmetaphysical modality as distinct from the other modalities considered\nthus far. \nStill more controversial is the notion of normative necessity\n(Fine2002, Rosen 2020). One way of understanding this idea appeals to\nan analogy with nomic modality. We can think of nomically necessary\nfacts as those which follow from facts about the laws of nature. For\nexample, the nomic impossibility of something traveling faster than\nlight is a direct consequence of it being a law of nature that that\nnothing can travel faster than light. Someone might similarly claim\nthat there are fundamental normative laws or principles.\nSuppose that (5) stated one of those laws. Then the normative\nimpossibility of a state’s being good just because it is painful\ncould be understood as expressing a consequence of that underlying\nnormative law. \nThere is enormous controversy about each of these alleged varieties of\nmodality. For each of logical, conceptual, nomic, metaphysical and\nnormative flavors of modality, some philosophers have raised important\nchallenges to whether that flavor of modality is well-regimented,\ntheoretically useful, or genuinely distinct from others on the list.\nThis entry will not enter seriously into those debates. (For\ndiscussion of some of the issues, see the entry on\n varieties of modality.)\n If we instead provisionally assume that each of these notions is\nlegitimate, this will put us in a position to ask (in\n Section 2,\n below): what is the modal strength of the supervenience thesis that\nwe should accept? \nThe ethical supervenience theses discussed thus far are\nontological: they propose various covariance relationships\nbetween ethical properties and certain other properties. However,\nJames Klagge (1988) has helpfully regimented an important alternative\nway of understanding ethical supervenience. Call two circumstances\nthat a thinker believes to be identical in all base respects\napparently base-identical. Now consider the following\nclaim: \nUnlike the supervenience theses encountered so far, Ascriptive is\nfundamentally a claim about ethical judgments: it is a claim\nthat someone who makes a certain pair of such judgments thereby makes\na mistake. Klagge usefully dubs claims like this ascriptive\nsupervenience theses. \nA fully informative ascriptive supervenience thesis would explain how\nwe should understand the mistake claimed by Ascriptive. There\nare several possibilities, of which four are worth emphasizing. The\nclaimed mistake could be alethic, consisting in having made\nat least one judgment with a false content. Or it might be\nepistemic: consisting in making at least one epistemically\nunjustified judgment. It could be conceptual, consisting in\njudging in a way that is inconsistent with the meanings of ethical\nwords. Finally, it might be characterized as ethical,\nconsisting in making a judgment in a way that is vicious or ethically\nobjectionable. (Note that the relevant judgment might be mistaken in\nmore than one of these ways.) \nBecause ascriptive supervenience theses are about judgments rather\nthan relations between classes of properties, they are quite different\nfrom the ontological supervenience theses we have considered thus far.\nOne way to bring this out is to notice that one could potentially\naccept Ascriptive without thereby having any views about whether there\nare ethical properties. On the other hand, there are interesting\nconnections between certain ascriptive and ontological supervenience\ntheses. For example, anyone who accepts Strong Intuitive seems to be\ncommitted to a version of Ascriptive, with an alethic gloss on\n‘mistake’. \nThis entry began with the suggestion that it is plausible that the\nethical supervenes. This section has aimed to clarify some of our\noptions for understanding that idea. The various interpretive options\nwe have explored together suggest a dizzying space of possible ethical\nsupervenience theses. This in turn raises a pressing question: which\nof these theses (if any) best articulate the plausibility and\nsignificance that philosophers have often taken ethical supervenience\nto have? One thing that might help to answer this question is to\nconsider the arguments that we can give for supervenience: these\narguments might favor some of these theses over others.  \nIt is common for philosophers to endorse ethical supervenience without\nmuch argument (an important exception is Smith 2004; for critical\ndiscussion of a variety of the arguments that have been offered, see\nRoberts 2018, 10–18). Part of the reason for this is that\nethical supervenience is taken to be both obvious and uncontroversial.\n(Rosen 2020 calls it “The least controversial thesis in\nmetaethics”.) Further, ethical supervenience is often claimed or\nassumed to be an obvious conceptual truth, doubts about which are\nsupposed to reveal conceptual incompetence. The discussion just\ncompleted, however, suggests reason to worry about this assumption:\nthere is not one ethical supervenience thesis but instead a complex\nvariety of such theses. It is far from clear that we should accept all\nof these theses, and a substantive question how to assess each of\nthem. Given that supervenience claims are modal claims, those seeking\nto evaluate supervenience claims might begin by considering the\ngeneral question of how we can know modal facts (see the entry\n modality-epistemology/). \nThis section sets aside this broad question. Instead, it begins by\nsetting out a general strategy for arguing for ethical supervenience.\nIt then explores the implications of that strategy for the\ncontroversies introduced in the previous section. \nThe general argumentative strategy has two elements. The first element\ndefends ethical supervenience as a plausible generalization from\ncases. Thus, consider our orienting case of the embezzling bank\nmanager. This case provides us with a specific ethical\nsupervenience thesis: it suggests that the ethical quality of the\nmanager’s action cannot vary without something else varying as\nwell (compare Horgan and Timmons 1992, 226 on specific\nsupervenience facts). Next, notice that there is nothing special\nin this respect about the bank manager case: we can identify specific\nsupervenience facts about anything from genocide to insulting your\nneighbor’s hat. Each such fact is constituted by an interesting\nnecessary connection between ethical properties and some base\nproperties. It is theoretically unattractive to rest satisfied with a\nlong list of such necessary connections. Instead, we should look for a\nsingle thesis that unifies all of these specific theses into a single\npattern. This pattern can be captured by a general ethical\nsupervenience thesis such as Initial (compare McPherson 2012,\n211). \nThe second element of the general strategy for arguing for ethical\nsupervenience emphasizes the independent credibility of such a general\nsupervenience thesis. This element takes inspiration from a comment by\nHenry Sidgwick: \nIt is plausible to interpret Sidgwick as suggesting that although we\nseek explanatory power when we develop our account of the physical\nworld, we need to be prepared to admit brute contingency: the\npossibility that our best theories or explanations include claims like\n“and these just happened to be the initial conditions”, or\n(to be anachronistic) “it is a brute fact that the quantum wave\nfunction collapsed this way”. By contrast, we cannot\nadmit the analogous idea that it is a brute contingent fact that a\ncertain ethical property just happens to covary with the base\nproperties that are instantiated around here. Because of their modal\nscope, ethical supervenience theses reflect this ban on brute ethical\ncontingency (compare also Shafer-Landau 2003, 78; Smith 2004,\n225). \nThe two parts of the strategy complement each other: The first part of\nthe strategy defends general ethical supervenience on the basis of\nunification, which is a familiar and domain-general theoretical\nvirtue. The second part of the strategy suggests that we have further\nreasons to accept such a general thesis that stem from a feature of\nour understanding of the ethical domain specifically. \nWhile Initial is a general supervenience thesis, it is silent on many\nof the issues broached in\n Section 1.\n The next task is thus to extend the strategy just introduced to\ndiscuss those issues. Before doing so, it is important to emphasize\nthat many of the options considered in that section are\ncompatible: for example, supervenience on the natural\nproperties entails supervenience on all of the properties. Because of\nthis, an argument for the former thesis is not an argument against the\nlatter thesis. Because stronger ethical supervenience theses are\npotentially both more illuminating and more dialectically significant,\nthis section will focus on examining competing cases concerning what\nthe strongest well-supported ethical supervenience thesis\nis. \nThe general strategy just canvassed has two stages: the first stage\ncarefully examines cases, and the second appeals to our more general\nunderstanding of the ethical. Both parts of the strategy can be useful\nin addressing the question of what the ethical supervenes on. For\nexample,\n Section 1.1\n appealed to possible cases involving supernatural beings as part of\nan argument against the idea that the ethical supervenes on the\nnatural. In terms of the first part of the strategy, this suggests\nthat once we make salient the possibility of supernatural beings,\nethical supervenience theses that posit a naturalistic base become\nmore doubtful. In terms of the second part of the strategy, the same\ncases fit nicely with the Sidgwickian thesis: if an ethical claim were\ntrue in part because of some supernatural truth, it would thereby not\nbe brutely true. As noted in\n Section 1.1,\n characterizing what the ethical supervenes on is an open challenge.\nThis merely illustrates how the strategy can be applied to make\nprogress on that challenge. \nThe general strategy can also be applied to the structural question:\nfor example,\n Section 1.2\n noted that weak supervenience is compatible with the idea that a\nutilitarian ethical principle is a fundamental truth in some possible\nworlds, but is false in others. Strong ethical supervenience, by\ncontrast, is incompatible with this idea. Many philosophers believe\nthat the fundamental ethical principles could not vary contingently in\nthis way, because this would again threaten to entail that some\nfundamental ethical truths are brute contingencies. If correct, this\nsupports the idea that ethical supervenience is a strong supervenience\nthesis. On the other hand, assessing whether ethical supervenience is\nstrong or global (or both) might require adjudicating live\nmetaphysical controversies concerning the relationship between strong\nand global supervenience (for discussion of these controversies, see\nsection 4.3.1 of the entry on\n supervenience). \nWhat about the modality of ethical supervenience? One might\nthink of this question as seeking to clarify what sort of\nnon-contingency the Sidgwickian commitment requires. If we distinguish\nlogical from conceptual necessity, it is easy to see that the\nlogical supervenience of the ethical is a non-starter. The\ntruth of ‘pain is bad’, e.g., is not secured simply by the\nlogical vocabulary and the syntax of the sentence, in the way that the\ntruth of ‘all bachelors are bachelors’ seemingly is. \nThe most common view in the literature is that the supervenience of\nthe ethical is a conceptual truth. Here we cannot simply adapt the\ngeneral strategy used so far, since neither the cases nor the\ninference to the best explanation from those cases seems to settle the\nmatter. Consider three reasons to think that ethical supervenience is\na conceptual truth.  \nFirst, to adapt R. M. Hare’s canonical example (1952,\n§5.2), if I mentioned to you that one possible act was right, and\nanother wrong, despite these acts being exactly alike in all other\nrespects, your initial reaction would be puzzlement, and if I\npersisted in my view upon interrogation, you might start to worry that\nI was simply confused or misusing words. Second, the crucial cases\nused to support supervenience—like the embezzling banker\ncase—seem to involve conceivability reasoning: we are\nasked to consider two circumstances that are identical in all base\nrespects, and notice that we cannot make sense of the idea that they\ndiffer in ethical respects. Some philosophers find it natural to think\nthat conceivability reasoning first and foremost reveals facts about\nconceptual possibility and necessity. This can be bolstered by a third\n(much more controversial) thought. Conceivability reasoning appears to\nbe a priori. But if such reasoning fundamentally concerned the world\nrather than our concepts, then we would seemingly have a priori access\nto substantive facts about the world, which many philosophers have\nfound deeply mysterious. \nEach of the sorts of reasons just offered is controversial. Consider\nthree examples of this controversy. First, it is controversial whether\nthe sorts of puzzlement reactions identified by Hare must signal\nconceptual confusion or misuse (Kramer 2009, Harrison 2013). For\nexample, perhaps we take ethical supervenience claims to be so obvious\nthat when someone appears to deny them, we are inclined to treat\nconceptual confusion or difference as a charitable hypothesis. One\npotential piece of evidence for this is that when denial of ethical\nsupervenience is based upon reasoned arguments, such as those\nmentioned in\n Section 5\n below, a diagnosis of conceptual confusion or difference arguably\nbecome less plausible diagnosis. \nSecond, philosophers unafraid of the ‘synthetic a priori’\ncan reject the inference from conceivability reasoning to conceptual\nstatus. It is notable here that a great deal of work in contemporary\nmetaphysics appeals to something like conceivability reasoning to\nargue directly for claims about the nature of reality. Third, the very\nnotion of conceptual truth is hotly contested: many philosophers have\nbecome convinced that there is no notion of conceptual truth that is\nboth coherent and philosophically interesting (for discussion, see the\nentry on the\n analytic-synthetic distinction). \nSet aside these challenges for the moment, and consider how we should\ninterpret the idea that ethical supervenience is a conceptual truth.\nWe saw above that there is some support for thinking that ethical\nsupervenience is a strong supervenience thesis. But combining this\nidea with the idea that the modality of supervenience is conceptual\nleads to complications. To see the issue, recall the schema for Strong\nSupervenience: \nIf we interpret the claim that ethical supervenience is conceptual by\nreplacing ‘Necessarily’ in the schema with ‘it is a\nconceptual truth that’. The result is: \nOne central problem with Strong Conceptual is that it claims that for\nevery instantiated ethical property, there is a base property such\nthat: it is a conceptual truth that anything that has this base\nproperty also has the ethical property. And this consequence will seem\ndefensible only on certain very controversial views about ethics and\nconceptual analysis. \nThe implausibility of Strong Conceptual may explain why two of the\nmost influential philosophers who discussed supervenience in ethics\n—R. M. Hare (1984, 4) and Simon Blackburn (cf. 1985, 134, and\nthe contrast between ‘supervenience’ and\n‘necessity’ in 1984, 183–4.)—seemed to accept\nsomething like weak but not strong conceptual supervenience of the\nethical. \nHowever, as noted above, it appears that we have reason to accept\nsomething stronger than weak ethical supervenience (Shoemaker 1987,\n440–1; for dissent see Miller 2017). It is thus worth\nconsidering alternatives that capture that strength without succumbing\nto the difficulties facing Strong Conceptual. One way to avoid the\nproblem is to interpret the first necessity operator in Strong as\nconceptual, while leaving the second operator as metaphysical: \nThis avoids the implausible implications that Strong Conceptual has:\nStrong Mixed says only that it is a conceptual truth that a certain\nbase property (we may not know which) covaries with each ethical\nproperty. \nNote that Strong Mixed is only one possible mixed-modality\nsupervenience thesis: one could reinterpret either necessity operator,\nto produce one of a wide variety of possible mixed ethical\nsupervenience theses. For example, the second necessity operator could\nbe interpreted as normative (rather than metaphysical) necessity. Such\nmixed modality theses have not yet been seriously explored. \nAnother option is to offer a conceptual version of the Strong\nIntuitive supervenience thesis mentioned in\n Section 1.2: \nBecause it does not posit known relations between specific ethical and\nbase properties, Intuitive Conceptual does not face the difficulties\nof Strong Conceptual. Intuitive Conceptual also has an advantage over\nStrong Mixed: the latter commits one to metaphysical as well as\nconceptual modality. Intuitive Conceptual is a plausible option for\nphilosophers who take there to be a stronger alternative to weak\nethical supervenience, but who are suspicious of the notion of\nmetaphysical modality. \nAmong philosophers who reject the idea that ethical supervenience is a\nconceptual truth, many will insist that the supervenience of the\nethical is at least metaphysically necessary. Most such philosophers\nappear happy to accept the strong metaphysical supervenience of the\nethical. Such philosophers might defend the metaphysical supervenience\nof the ethical by applying the general strategy suggested at the\nbeginning of this section, while rejecting the case for thinking this\nstrategy has specifically conceptual implications. Other philosophers\nwill reject the idea that we should begin with the sorts of judgments\nabout cases that drove the general strategy. They can instead argue\nthat the metaphysical supervenience of the ethical is supported as an\nabstract consequence of the best overall empirical theory concerning\nethical facts (e.g. Sturgeon 2009, 61). \nOther philosophers reject the conceptual and metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical, but claim that the ethical supervenes\nnomically or normatively. In general, such supervenience theses are\ntoo weak to support the sorts of arguments from ethical supervenience\nthat philosophers have made. Because of this, arguments for these\ntheses will be discussed in\n Section 5.4,\n which concerns doubts about ethical supervenience. \nFinally, how should we decide between ontological and ascriptive\nsupervenience theses? Proponents of ascriptive supervenience take on\nthe obligation of making precise the sort of mistake that\n‘supervenience-violators’ are allegedly making, and\ndefending the idea that this is a mistake. The most prominent approach\ntakes the mistake to be conceptual, which involves commitments similar\nto those taken on by defenders of the conceptual supervenience theses\njust discussed. \nOne reason to focus on ascriptive supervenience theses is that some\nphilosophers deny that our ethical thought and talk commits us to the\nexistence of ethical facts and properties. Such philosophers can still\ngrant that if we interpret supervenience in an ascriptive way, it\nprovides important insights into ethics. Further, philosophers who\naccept that there are ethical facts and properties can also accept\nascriptive supervenience theses about ethical thought. Indeed, if we\nunderstand Ascriptive as a conceptual claim, then together with\nrealism it could provide the basis for accepting a conceptual-strength\nethical supervenience thesis. This means that ascriptive ethical\nsupervenience theses have the potential to be a point of significant\ncommon ground between philosophers with widely differing views about\nthe nature of ethical thought and talk. And this might make them\nespecially dialectically powerful in arguments that appeal to ethical\nsupervenience. \nThis section examines arguments in and about ethics that philosophers\nhave made which appeal centrally to ethical supervenience as a\npremise. The bulk of the section discusses the most influential\nsupervenience arguments in ethics, which have concerned realism and\nreduction, before considering the significance of ethical\nsupervenience for the epistemology of ethics, and for debates about\nthe existence of ethical principles. \nThe earliest influential discussions of what we now call supervenience\nin ethics focused on its significance for substantive ethical\ninvestigation. Henry Sidgwick draws from it what he takes to be a\n“practical rule of some value” for such investigation\n(1907, 208–9). And G. E. Moore (1922) used the idea as part of\nhis attempt to explain the idea of intrinsic value. Given that Moore\nand Sidgwick were both ethical realists, it is perhaps striking that\nthe most influential philosophical use of ethical supervenience has\nbeen in arguments against ethical realism. \nIn his argument for error theory, J. L. Mackie briefly claims that\nsupervenience makes trouble for the realist. His quick argument can\nusefully serve as a prelude to the more detailed discussion to come.\nMackie suggests that we think that actions have their ethical\nproperties because they have some natural features. For\nexample, we think a certain action wrong because it is cruel. He\ndenies that this ‘because’ references a conceptual\nentailment, and thinks this raises two questions: (1) what sort of\nrelation is the connection being referred to? And (2) how do\nwe come to know that actions stand in this relation? (1977, 41). As it\nstands, Mackie’s questions serve more as a research agenda than\nan argument (for important recent discussion, see Olson 2014,\n§5.1). It appears plausible that realists should aim to have\nsomething illuminating to say both about the nature of the relation\nbetween the ethical and base properties, and a credible epistemology\nfor how we come to know such relations. But Mackie’s questions\ndo not yet constitute an argument that realists cannot achieve these\naims. \nSimon Blackburn developed a more substantial supervenience argument\nagainst realism. The details of Blackburn’s various\npresentations of his argument (1971, 1984, and 1985) are complex and\nraise difficult interpretive questions; the reconstruction that\nfollows is a rather free interpretation of Blackburn’s (1984,\n183–4; for sympathetic discussion, see Mabrito 2005 and Mitchell\n2017). The argument starts with two claims: \nNow consider an act of happiness-maximizing promise-breaking. It\nfollows from (2) that is conceptually possible that the world is\nbase-identical to the actual world, and this act is wrong, but it is\nalso conceptually possible that the world is base-identical to the\nactual world, and this act is not wrong. But from (1), we can notice\nthat it is not conceptually possible that there are two\nbase-identical acts, one of which is wrong and one of which is\nnot. \nThis combination is supposed to be difficult for the realist to\nexplain. For (2) seems to show that there is no conceptual link\nbetween ethical concepts like ‘wrong’ and any one of our\nnaturalistic concepts. And if ethical concepts function to pick out\nproperties (as the realist claims), then given this conceptual\nseparation, it seems that we should be able to identify conceptual\npossibilities by arbitrarily “mixing and matching”\ndistributions of naturalistic and ethical properties. Ethical\nsupervenience precisely functions to limit such mixing and\nmatching. \nConsider four possible ways that the realist might reply. First, the\nrealist could seek to debunk the challenge. For example, she might do\nthis by denying that the ethical supervenes with conceptual necessity\n(see\n the previous section\n for discussion). Or she might reject the supervenience of the ethical\non the natural (see\n Section 1.1),\n and challenge Blackburn to identify a supervenience base for which\nthe argument remains potent. \nSecond, the realist might seek to explain the pattern of individual\nconceptual possibility without conceptual co-possibility. For example,\nif it were a conceptual truth that ethical properties were natural\nproperties, then this would explain the pattern of knowledge suggested\nhere (Dreier 1992, 20). An analogy may help to make this vivid: it\nmight be a conceptual truth that physical properties are natural\nproperties (compare Kim 2011). But which total naturalistic patterns\nin the world the physical properties covary with is arguably an\nempirical question. One might take these examples to illustrate a\ngeneral reply: the pattern is not puzzling, because it simply reflects\nthe limitation of our conceptually-based insight into reality\n(Shafer-Landau 2003, 86). \nThird, some realists are prepared to claim more ambitiously that we\ncan give a conceptual analysis of rightness in base terms\n(e.g. Jackson 1998, Ch. 5). Such philosophers can thereby deny (2),\ncutting the argument off at the knees. (Dreier 1992, 17–18\nsuggests that Blackburn’s argument simply begs the question\nagainst this sort of reductive realist.) Such realists take on the\nburden of rejecting the most famous argument in metaethics: G. E.\nMoore’s “open question argument” (1903, Ch. 1).\nHowever, it is a hotly contested question what—if\nany—probative value this argument has (for discussion, see\nsection 2 of the entry on\n moral non-naturalism). \nA fourth reply would be to shrug off the alleged explanatory\nchallenge. However allegedly puzzling the combination of the features\ndescribed by (1) and (2) are, they are consistent features of a\nconcept. This means that we could choose to introduce a concept that\nexemplified those features. It might thus be suggested that\nBlackburn’s argument shows only that we have chosen to do so\nwith our ethical concepts (compare Olson 2014, 89–90). One might\nreply to this last point that it is precisely this choice that needs\nto be explained. Blackburn argues that the non-cognitivist has a\nsmooth functionalist explanation for why our ethical thought and talk\nincludes the ban on mixed worlds (see\n Section 3.3\n below for discussion), while for the realist, this might just be an\nunexplained peculiarity of our choice of concepts. \nAs was just noted, a certain kind of reductive naturalist seems to\nhave an easy reply to Blackburn’s argument. In light of this, it\nis perhaps unsurprising that several philosophers have argued that\nethical supervenience theses support reductionist forms of ethical\nrealism against non-reductive forms. Consider a few important variants\nof such arguments. \nThe first is a simplified version of arguments due to Frank Jackson\n(1998, Ch. 5; see also related arguments by Brown\n2011 and Streumer 2017, Ch.s 2-3). The argument has two steps. The first step is an argument that\nif the ethical properties strongly (or globally) metaphysically\nsupervene on the base properties, then there is no metaphysically\npossible ethical difference between states that does not have a\ncorrelated base difference between the same states. If we make some\nliberal assumptions about property types, this entails in turn that\nthere is a base property that is necessarily coextensive with every\nethical property. \nThe second step of the argument is the claim that necessarily\ncoextensive properties are identical. Brown offers a nice motivation\nfor this thesis: we should commit ourselves to the existence of a\nproperty only insofar as it can do explanatory work, and the only way\nfor a property to do explanatory work is for it to distinguish\nmetaphysical possibilities (2011, 213). If we assume that identity is\nsufficient for reduction, these two steps together entail the\nreduction of the ethical. \nWhile both steps of the argument are controversial, the second stage\nhas come in for especially heavy fire. (For a careful discussion of\nthe dialectic, see Suikkanen 2010; for an ingenious argument against\nJackson that identity with descriptive properties is\ncompatible with ethical non-naturalism, see Dunaway 2017). One\nimportant general basis for doubt is that many contemporary\nphilosophers question whether modality constitutes the fundamental\nexplanatory currency of metaphysics, as Jackson and Brown seem to\npresuppose (for an especially influential challenge see Fine 1994, for\nan especially radical challenge, see Sider 2011, Ch. 12).  \nThe argument for reduction from metaphysical supervenience can,\nhowever, be prosecuted within frameworks that reject Jackson’s\nand Brown’s core assumptions. Consider two examples. First, one\nmight deny that necessary coextension entails identity, but\nnonetheless argue that the best explanation of ethical supervenience\nis a grounding relation that suffices to ensure that ethical\nproperties are identical to some of the base properties (Bader 2017).\nSecond, you might deny that reduction requires identity. Of course,\nidentifying non-obvious identities is a powerful model of reduction.\nFor example, a standard way of characterizing the physicalistic\nreduction of heat is that the heat in a volume of gas is\nidentical to the mean molecular kinetic energy of that volume\nof gas, which is a physical property. However, there is no consensus\nconcerning how to understand reduction as a metaphysical relation (for\na taste of the controversy, see McPherson 2015, §3, and the entry\non\n scientific reduction\n and the discussion of reduction in the entry on\n David Lewis). \nThe core idea at stake in debates over reduction is that commitment to\nthe existence of the reduced properties should constitute no\nontological commitment “over and above” commitment to the\nreducing properties. Some philosophers have sought to spell out this\nidea by appealing to essence rather than to identity.\nConsider an essentialist account of reduction (cf. Rosen 2017b, 163),\non which the A properties reduce to the B-properties\njust in case:  \n(i) it is necessary and sufficient for each A property to be\ninstantiated that some B property is instantiated; and  \n(ii) these modal facts follow from the essences of the\nA-properties.  \nThe idea is that if what it is to be each A property entails\nthat the A-properties are uniquely realized by the B-properties, this\namounts to a kind of reducibility of the A-properties. Consider an\nexample: one might take oneself to have offered a reduction of the\nnumber one, in claiming that: what it is to be the number one\nis just to be the successor of zero. One important contrast with the\nidentity conception is that on the essentialist conception, successful\nreductions reveal metaphysical structure. Thus, one might say in our\nexample that the number one is ‘built out of’ the number\nzero and the successor function. \nOn an influential essentialist account of metaphysical\nmodality, all necessities are to be explained by facts about the\nessences of things. Ralph Wedgwood (2007) and Gideon Rosen (2020)\nargue that on this sort of view, the strong metaphysical supervenience\nof the ethical would entail that the ethical possibilities are fully\nexplained by the essences of the base entities. \nInterestingly, both Rosen and Wedgwood reject this reductive\nconclusion. Wedgwood argues that some necessary truths (including\nethical supervenience theses) can be explained by certain contingent\ntruths, together with facts about essences, and that this sort of\nexplanation does not have reductive implications (2007, §9.3; for\ncritical discussion of this response, see McPherson 2009, Sec 3, and\nespecially Schmitt and Schroeder 2011). Rosen responds by rejecting\nthe strong metaphysical supervenience of the ethical (see\n Section 5.3\n below). \nAs\n Section 3.1\n explained, supervenience arguments were initially used by Mackie and\nBlackburn to raise doubts about ethical realism. Indeed, it has been\nwidely assumed that the realist faces a challenge here that the\nanti-realist does not. The issues here are complicated, and it will be\nhelpful to consider common varieties of ethical anti-realism\nseparately. \nFirst, consider ethical nihilism, the thesis that there are\nno ethical properties. The ethical nihilist might seem to have an easy\ntime explaining the metaphysical supervenience of the ethical: if\nthere are no ethical properties, there are, trivially, no ethical\ndifferences. And if there are no ethical differences, there are no\nethical differences without base differences. \nThis line of reasoning is too quick as it stands. Supervenience is a\nmodal claim, so contingent ethical nihilism—the thesis\nthat there are no actually instantiated ethical\nproperties—cannot explain ethical supervenience. Indeed, as\nChristian Coons (2011) has shown, it is possible to use supervenience\nto construct an interesting argument against contingent\nnihilism. A crucial question here is: what is the modality of the\nsupervenience thesis to be accounted for? If the supervenience thesis\nwe need to explain is conceptual, then even the truth of\nnon-contingent nihilism—the thesis that it is\nmetaphysically impossible for ethical properties to be\ninstantiated—would not do the relevant explanatory work. Only\nthe thesis that the instantiation of ethical properties is\nconceptually impossible would suffice. (Note that the\nnihilist might be able to adapt one of the realist replies to\nBlackburn discussed in\n Section 3.1,\n but in this case it would not be easier for the nihilist to\nexplain supervenience, than it is for the realist who adopts the same\nreply.) \nThe nihilist imagined above does not question the assumption that\nordinary ethical thought and talk commits us to ontological claims.\nOther ethical anti-realists, however, will deny this assumption (for\ndiscussion, see the entries on\n moral anti-realism\n and\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism).\n Consider two examples of such views. \nFirst, hermeneutic fictionalists about ethical thought and\ntalk argue that such thought and talk is to be understood as a form of\npretense or fictional discourse (see Kalderon 2005 for discussion and\ndefense). It will be natural for the hermeneutic fictionalist to\nreject ordinary ethical supervenience claims as misleading. However,\nthey will presumably still need to account for the considerations that\nlead other philosophers to accept ethical supervenience claims. The\nissues concerning ethical fictionalism and supervenience are\ncomparatively unexplored; see (Nolan, Restall, and West 2005,\n325–327) for important preliminary discussion. \nSecond (and much more influentially) some non-cognitivists\nabout ethical thought and talk deny that our ethical claims express\nbeliefs about the ethical nature of the world, suggesting instead that\nthey express desire-like mental states. Such a view may make\nontological supervenience claims about ethics appear misleading at\nbest. More interesting is the question of what non-cognitivists can\nsay about the sort of ascriptive supervenience thesis discussed in\n  Section 1.4: \nThis thesis is an alleged correctness constraint on ethical thought\nand talk. Prominent philosophers in the non-cognitivist tradition\n(broadly understood) have characteristically claimed that their views\nenabled them to explain theses like Ascriptive. \nConsider a representative sample of these explanations. R. M. Hare\nclaims that ascriptive supervenience holds because a significant part\nof the function of moralizing is to teach others our ethical\nstandards, and the only way to do that is to get our audience to see\nthe recognizable pattern that we are prescribing that they follow\n(1952, 134). According to Simon Blackburn, the presumption of\nascriptive supervenience is required by the idea that our ethical\nattitudes are supposed to be practical guides to decision-making\n(1984, 186). According to Allan Gibbard (2003, Ch. 5), ascriptive\nsupervenience for ethical thought is explained by a consistency norm\non planning states. \nCritics of non-cognitivism (e.g. Zangwill 1997, 110–11; Sturgeon\n2009) have challenged the rationales offered by Hare and Blackburn.\nSuppose that we grant that consistency is useful, given the various\nfunctions of ethical discourse. It is unclear why this usefulness\nshould force on us a conceptual truth about moral discourse.\nFurther, it is arguable that all that is required for these practical\npurposes is consistency within worlds that are very similar to the\nactual world. So the idea that such consistency is required over every\npossible world (as seems to be the case for ethical supervenience)\nseems like considerably more than the practical considerations\nrequire. Gibbard’s rationale has faced related criticism: why\nmust planners be committed to consistency in the sweeping way that\nGibbard envisions (Chrisman 2005, 411–12; Sturgeon 2009,\n84–87)? If these critics are right, it is not clear that the\nnon-cognitivist has an especially compelling explanation of ethical\nsupervenience. And if they do not, this will complicate their efforts\nto claim that explaining ethical supervenience is a dialectical\nadvantage against cognitivism. It is also worth bearing in mind that\nthe details of which ethical supervenience thesis we need to explain\ncan affect how promising the non-cognitivist explanations will be. For\nan important illustration of this point, see (Atiq 2019). \nA further complication arises from the fact that leading contemporary\nheirs of non-cognitivism (such as Blackburn and Gibbard) have\nabandoned anti-realism. Instead, they have adopted what Simon\nBlackburn (e.g. 1993) has dubbed the ‘quasi-realist’\nprogram. This involves the claim that one can, while beginning with\nthe non-cognitivist’s framework, “earn the right” to\nrealist-sounding claims about ethical truth and objectivity (for\nfurther discussion see the section on noncognitivism\nin the entry on\n moral anti-realism). \nNow consider an ontological supervenience claim: that there can be no\ndifference in ethical properties without a difference in base\nproperties. The quasi-realist program can seem to commit the\nquasi-realist to accepting this claim. Dreier (2015) argues that this\nleads to a further challenge to the non-cognitivist: even if\nshe can explain ascriptive supervenience, it is not clear that she can\nexplain ontological supervenience. If this is the case, the most\ninfluential contemporary non-cognitivists may find that supervenience\nis a dialectical burden rather than benefit. \nSo far, this entry has focused on the significance of supervenience\nfor claims about the nature of ethical thought, talk, and metaphysics.\nHowever, influential early discussions of this sort of thesis seemed\nto have something else in mind. For example,\n Section 2\n above quoted an evocative passage from Henry Sidgwick. But\nSidgwick’s point was not to argue about the metaphysics of\nethics. Rather, he was proposing a supervenience-like idea as an\nepistemological corrective to ad hoc special pleading in one’s\nethical reasoning (1907, 209). \nThe mere fact of supervenience could not play this sort of role: after\nall, the supervenience of the ethical is compatible with the idea that\neveryone ought always to do what I want them to do. However, Sidgwick\npoints to an important idea: that we expect there to be a rational\nexplanation for any ethical fact. One ambitious way of developing this\nidea has been suggested by Nick Zangwill (2006). According to\nZangwill, a central conceptual constraint on ethical reasoning is the\n“because constraint”: when we judge something to be wrong\n(or to have another ethical property), we are committed to its having\nthis property because it has some other property. Zangwill\nclaims that this principle “either is, or explains”\nethical supervenience (2006, 273). And Zangwill goes on to argue that\nthis constraint has striking epistemological implications: he claims\nthat it entails that our only epistemic access to facts about\nthe distribution of ethical properties is by knowing about the\ndistribution of base properties, and knowing ethical principles that\nlink the presence of base properties to ethical properties. He then\nargues that our knowledge of these ethical principles could itself\nonly be a priori (2006, 276). If Zangwill is right about this, then\nthe a priori character of moral epistemology can be derived from\nclaims about the supervenience of the ethical. \nOne worry about this argument is that it might overgeneralize. The\n“because” structure seems to be shared by other normative\ndomains: it would be very odd to claim that a particular chess move\nwas winning, or that a particular action was illegal, without being\ncommitted to their being some general explanation in terms of the\nrules of chess, or the relevant laws, that explains this particular\nfact. But our knowledge of the law and the rules of chess is\nempirical. So one might wonder what precisely prevents our knowledge\nof ethical principles being empirical as well. \nOne traditional assumption about ethics is that our ethical\nobligations can be expressed by general ethical principles. This\nassumption has recently been challenged by ethical\nparticularists, who claim that our ethical reasons and\nobligations cannot be codified into principles. Supervenience might\nseem to be relevant to this debate. For as\n Section 3.2\n above showed, some philosophers argue that the strong metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical entails that for every ethical property,\nthere will be a base property that is necessarily coextensive with it.\nFocusing on wrongness, this in turn has the apparent consequence that\nthere is a base property B such that: \nOne might think that Entailment just is the schema for an ethical\nprinciple concerning wrongness: for example, if we substitute\n‘fails to maximize happiness’ for ‘is\nB’ we seem to get a clear statement of a utilitarian\nethical principle. And this in turn might seem to cast doubt on the\ncoherence of particularism. \nThis reasoning, however, is too quick. To see this, note that\nsupervenience itself in no way guarantees that B will be some\nelegant base property like failing to maximize happiness. B\nmight instead be enormously complicated: at the limit, supervenience\nis compatible with B simply being a disjunction of an\ninfinitely long list of complete base specifications of various\npossible worlds. Call an instance of Entailment with such a base a\ngruesome entailment . It is not clear that such entailments\nconstitute principles that are incompatible with particularism. One\nreason to think that they do not is that genuine ethical principles\narguably have explanatory power. Margaret Little argues that\nthe “radical over-specificity” of gruesome entailments\nrenders them non-explanatory, and hence inapt to be principles (2000,\n286). Another reason to doubt that gruesome entailments are principles\nis that we ordinarily assume that ethical principles would be usable\nby agents (Dancy 2004, 87–8), but a gruesome\n“principle” is clearly not. (For a relevant argument that\nthe true instance of Entailment could not be gruesome,\nbecause it would need to be learnable by ordinary speakers, see\nJackson, Pettit, and Smith 2000). \nThe Blackburn-inspired argument against ethical realism relies\ncrucially on the assumption that ethical supervenience is a conceptual\ntruth. For thesis (2) was crucial to that argument: \nWhile many find (2) plausible, fewer would be prepared to accept a\npurely metaphysical version of this thesis, such as: \nThis is precisely because thesis (2*) is inconsistent with the strong\nmetaphysical supervenience of the ethical, which very many\nphilosophers accept. This means that a purely metaphysical variant of\nBlackburn’s argument will not be plausible. \nThis does not mean, however, that treating ethical supervenience as a\nnon-conceptual truth renders it dialectically inert. This section\nconsiders the significance of metaphysical supervenience for ethical\nrealism: does it pose a challenge to ethical realism? If so, how can\nwe best understand this challenge? And what resources do different\nsorts of ethical realist have to meet the challenge? \nTo focus our discussion, assume this metaphysical variant of Strong\nIntuitive (cf. Rosen 2020):  \nIntuitive Metaphysical might pose a challenge to the ethical realist\nin light of one of at least two background ideas. First, some\nphilosophers have argued that there are no necessary connections\nbetween “distinct existences,” a claim that is sometimes\ncalled Hume’s dictum. If Hume’s dictum is correct, then the\nethical realist will be committed to the ethical not being distinct in\nthe relevant sense from what it supervenes on. The metaphysical use of\nHume’s dictum faces at least two formidable challenges. The first is\nto clarify the dictum in such a way that it is both interesting and a\nplausible candidate for truth. To see this, note that many\nnon-identical properties are necessarily connected: for example, a\nsurface’s being scarlet entails that it is red, but being scarlet is\nnot identical to being red. Red and scarlet, then, must not count as\ndistinct in the sense relevant to a plausible form of the dictum. This\nraises the question: what does distinctness amount to? If we use\nnecessary connection as a criterion, then Hume’s dictum turns out to\nbe a trivial way of tracking this way of using the word\n‘distinct’. Second, Hume’s dictum is usually defended on\ndirectly intuitive grounds. This raises a deep methodological\nquestion: if we notice a conflict between Hume’s dictum and another\nintuitively plausible claim, why should we retain Hume’s dictum and\njettison the other claim? (For helpful discussion of Hume’s Dictum,\nsee Wilson 2010). \nConsider a second way of developing a challenge to the ethical\nrealist, inspired by the Sidgwickian motivation for accepting ethical\nsupervenience, introduced in\n Section 2.\n According to this motivation, we should accept an ethical\nsupervenience thesis because doing so rules out the implausible\nhypothesis of brute ethical contingency. Intuitive Metaphysical\nclearly satisfies this motivation: it permits no brutely contingent\nethical variation. However, suppose that it was not possible to\nexplain why the ethical properties supervene on the base properties.\nThen the very thesis that we used to explain why there was no brute\nethical contingency would turn out to be something arguably even more\npeculiar. It would be a metaphysically necessary connection that\nnonetheless has what Sidgwick might call an “arbitrary element\nin which we have to acquiesce;” in a slogan: a brute\nnecessity.  \nA natural way of thinking about the significance of brute necessity\nbegins with the assumption that we are entitled to a default\ncombinatorial assumption about modality: that for any pair of\nproperties F and G, it is possible that there is an\nx that is both F and G, that x is only one\nand not the other, and that there is an x that is neither\nF nor G. The next step is to suggest that this default\nassumption can be defeated. Consider red and scarlet: on one view, to\nbe red just is to be scarlet or crimson or cherry red\nor… The thesis that this is what it is to be red, if true,\nwould provide a straightforward explanation of why the combinatorial\nassumption is defeated here: it is not possible for something to be\nscarlet but not red precisely because of what it is to be red. Where\nwe take there to be no such explanation however, we should be loathe\nto accept an alleged necessary connection (cf. McPherson (2012); for a\nsimilar idea in a different context, compare Levine and Trogdon 2009).\nCall this constraint on our metaphysical theorizing\nanti-brutalism.  \nBoth Hume’s dictum and anti-brutalism put us in a position to\npose a conditional challenge to the ethical realist. If the realist\nthinks that the ethical properties are distinct from the base\nproperties, they must reject either metaphysical supervenience or\nHume’s dictum. And if they think the supervenience of the\nethical is a brute necessity, they need to explain why such brutalism\nis not objectionable. Different variants of ethical realism have\ndifferent resources available to address this challenge. The remainder\nof this section examines some of these resources. \nAs\n Section 3.2\n explained, some philosophers have argued that the supervenience of\nthe ethical entails that the ethical can be reduced. These arguments\nare quite controversial, but it is perhaps less controversial that a\nsuccessful reduction of the ethical properties would suffice to\nexplain the metaphysical supervenience of the ethical. \nConsider first a reductive account that identifies the ethical\nproperties with some natural or supernatural property. Assuming that\nnatural and supernatural properties are among the base properties, the\nsupervenience of rightness on the base properties would be easily\nexplained on this view: because rightness is identical to a base\nproperty, on this view, there clearly cannot be a difference in\nrightness without some difference in base properties. \nIf essentialist explanations are legitimate, essentialist reduction\nagain appears to be a straightforward way of explaining the\nsupervenience of the ethical. Part of the idea of essence is that\nnecessarily, nothing can survive the loss of one of its essential\nproperties. So if rightness had an essentialist real definition purely\nin terms of base properties, then it would be clear why there could be\nno difference in rightness without a difference in base properties.\n \nIn light of this, neither Hume’s dictum nor anti-brutalism\nappear to cast doubt on either sort of reductive theory, for both\ntheories are able to explain supervenience, and hence avoid commitment\nto a brute necessary connection between the ethical properties and the\nbase properties. \nTerence Horgan and Mark Timmons claim that even if the ethical realist\nendorses reduction, they face a further explanatory burden before they\ncan fully explain supervenience: “Even if goodness, for\ninstance, is identical to some specific natural property, there\nremains the task of explaining why this natural property,\nrather than any other one(s), counts as the correct referent of the\nterm ‘goodness’” (1992, 230; emphasis in original).\nThis is a fair explanatory demand, if we interpret it as the familiar\nchallenge to provide a plausible theory of reference for ethical terms\n(a demand that Horgan and Timmons have pressed incisively). However\nthis challenge does not appear to have anything distinctive to do with\nsupervenience. Either the reductive naturalistic realist can explain\nthe reference of ‘wrong,’ in which case she can also\nexplain supervenience, or she cannot explain the reference of\n‘wrong,’ in which case her view is implausible for reasons\nthat have nothing to do with supervenience. \nOne influential account of metaphysical structure, especially in the\nphilosophy of mind, has been functionalism. Here is a simplified toy\nexample of a functional analysis: any system that takes some money as\nan input, and reliably produces a candy as an output, thereby counts\nas a candy machine. On this account, the kind candy machine\nis individuated by input-output relations. A functional kind\nis any kind that can be individuated in this way. Because functional\nkinds are not individuated by the nature of the stuff that realizes\nthe functional relations, they are often claimed to be\nparadigmatically friendly to multiple realization. Thus,\ngiven my characterization of candy machines, such a machine could be\nrealized by a structure composed of metal or of plastic or perhaps\neven of spooky supernatural stuff. In light of this possibility of\nmultiple realization, the relationship of functionalism to reduction\nis controversial: many philosophers have taken multiple realizability\nto constitute a barrier to reduction, but others disagree. (See the\nentries on\n functionalism\n and\n multiple realization\n for useful discussion). \nNow consider a version of ethical realism that takes ethical\nproperties to be functional properties. Such a view, like the\nreductionist view, appears well-placed to explain the metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical. This is because functional properties\nnecessarily covary with the class of properties that are their\npossible realizers. If, for example, every complex property that could\nrealize a candy machine is a natural property, then there could be no\n“candy machine difference” without a naturalistic\ndifference. Similarly, if ethical properties are functional properties\nthat could only be realized by certain of the base properties, then\nthe supervenience of the ethical on the base properties would be\nsmoothly explained. \nThe strategies for explaining ethical supervenience discussed in the\npreceding two sections are useful to reductionist and\nfunctionalist ethical realists. However, many contemporary\nethical realists reject both functionalism and reductionism about\nethical properties. Most strikingly, several contemporary ethical\nrealists are non-naturalists, claiming that the ethical\nproperties are a distinct and irreducible class of properties (see the\nentry on\n moral non-naturalism\n for discussion). Several philosophers have argued that ethical\nsupervenience poses a distinctive problem for the non-naturalist\n(Dreier 1992, 2019 ; Ridge 2007; McPherson 2012; Väyrynen 2017).\nSo it is worth asking what metaphysical resources non-naturalists\nmight have for explaining the supervenience of the ethical. \nA salient place to begin is with the grounding relation. As\nwas noted in\n Section 1,\n grounding has recently been theorized as an asymmetrical explanatory\nmetaphysical relationship (For an introduction to grounding, see the\nentry on\n metaphysical grounding;\n for a useful discussion of relevant issues in the context of ethics,\nsee Väyrynen 2013a). It is thus natural to ask whether the\nnon-naturalist could explain the supervenience of the ethical on the\nbase properties by appealing to the fact that: certain facts about the\ninstantiation of the base properties fully ground all facts\nabout the instantiation of the ethical properties. \nA natural question at this point concerns why such a\ngrounding relationship holds. An influential answer is that all\ngrounding facts are themselves explained in essentialist terms (Fine\n1994, Rosen 2010). As\n Section 4.1\n suggested, these essentialist explanations can appear to have\nreductionist implications. If so, essentialist explanations are no\nhelp to the non-naturalist. \nStephanie Leary has offered an ingenious proposal within the\nessentialist framework: she posits a class of “hybrid”\nproperties, whose essences entail (i) that they are instantiated just\nin case certain base properties are instantiated, and (ii) that\nethical properties are instantiated whenever they are instantiated,\nand argues that these relations do not suffice for essentialist\nreduction of the ethical (Leary 2017; for critical discussion see\nFaraci 2017 and Toppinen 2018). \nA recently influential alternative to the essentialist account of\ngrounding proposes that we can explain the grounding of the ethical in\nterms of metaphysical laws. Here is the basic idea. One class\nof ethical facts are facts which state the instantiation of some\nethical property. An example of such an ethical instantiation fact\nwould be: Alice’s current state is intrinsically bad.\nOne explanation of why the ethical supervenes is that such facts are\nalways grounded in certain base facts, such as: Alice is currently\nin pain. The proponent of law-mediated ethical grounding denies\nthat the latter base fact provides a complete grounding explanation\nfor the former ethical fact. Rather, a complete grounding explanation\nwill take this form:  \nIt requires a base fact (e.g. Alice is currently in pain) and\nan ethical law (e.g. Pain grounds badness), in order to fully\nground any ethical instantiation fact (e.g. Alice’s current\nstate is intrinsically bad). \nSuppose that, necessarily, every possible ethical instantiation fact\nis grounded by the combination of a base fact and an ethical law, as\nin this example. Then, (i) this would provide a complete explanation\nfor supervenience: this grounding structure would explain why the\ninstantiation of ethical properties must covary with thew\ninstantiation of base properties. And (ii) this might look like a\npromising explanation on behalf of the non-naturalist, since the\nethical laws could be metaphysically fundamental ethical entities. If\nethical laws such as the one mentioned here are metaphysically\nfundamental, then one might think that this would secure\nnon-naturalism (For this reason, Gideon Rosen calls such\nmetaphysically fundamental laws ‘Moorean connections’\n(2010, §13).  \nThe appeal to fundamental laws may seem to raise the same concerns\nthat a brute supervenience relation did, however: Why is there a\nmetaphysical law linking these distinct properties? The contrast with\nessentialist explanations is striking: in the latter case, facts about\nthe natures of the related properties explain the links between them.\nHowever, some have argued that metaphysical grounding relations are\neither commonly, or even universally, law-mediated (e.g. Kment 2014,\n§6.2.3; Wilsch 2015). For a taste of the currently flowering\nliterature on the explanatory role of ethical laws or principles, see\n(Eliot 2014; Scanlon 2014, Ch. 2; Schroeder 2014; Skarsaune 2015;\n§7; Rosen 2017a; 2017c; Berker forthcoming; and Morton\nforthcoming). \nThis brief sketch of possible types of metaphysical explanations of\nsupervenience barely scratches the surface. Among the many other\noptions, replies grounded in appeals to tropes or universals have\ngarnered explicit attention (Ridge 2007, Suikkanen 2010). As with the\nappeal to grounding, a central question about such strategies is\nwhether they constitute genuine explanatory progress, or whether they\nsimply explain one necessity by appealing to some further brute\nnecessity. \nThis and the next subsection consider attempts to explain the\nmetaphysical supervenience of the ethical by appealing to conceptual\nor ethical premises. \nThe first such strategy appeals to analytic or conceptual truths.\nSuppose that an ethical realist accepts the popular view that ethical\nsupervenience is an analytic truth. She might put her view this\nway: \nThe core idea is that the truth of Analytic explains the truth of the\nsupervenience thesis that it embeds (Intuitive Metaphysical). On this\naccount, the ethical and the base properties covary because it is\ndefinitional of ‘ethical’ that nothing could\ncount as an ethical property unless it covaried in this way. This\nstrategy claims to meet the bruteness challenge: the necessary\nconnection is explained by the way a property would have to be, in\norder to be what we talk about when we talk about ethical properties\n(cf. Stratton-Lake and Hooker 2006). \nConsider three brief worries about this strategy. The first is that on\nsome influential contemporary accounts of analyticity, analyticity\ndoes not guarantee truth. For example, one account of analyticity is\nthat for a sentence ‘S’ to be analytic in a language L is\nfor competence with L to dispose a speaker to accept ‘S’.\nAnd some philosophers (e.g. Eklund 2002) have argued that there are\ninconsistent sets of sentences that satisfy this condition. If this is\nright, Intuitive Metaphysical’s being analytic in\nEnglish would not guarantee its being true. \nThe second worry is broadly intuitive. Analytic alone does not appear\nto guarantee that the supervenience of the ethical follows\nfrom the other aspects of the nature of ethical properties. And this\nsuggests that, for all Analytic says, we can conceive of ethical*\nproperties, which have every feature characteristic of ethical\nproperties, except that they do not supervene. But this may lead us to\nwonder: why give the ethical properties the role in our lives that we\ndo, and ignore the ethical* properties, just because they do not\nsupervene? (For a related point, see the end of Mabrito 2005.) \nThe third worry is that even if the truth of Analytic entails the\ntruth of Intuitive Metaphysical, it nonetheless arguably does nothing\nto explain why the supervenience relationship holds. Consider\nan analogy: suppose that the infallible oracle tells you that a\ncertain ethical supervenience thesis holds. This testimony does\nnothing to explain why that supervenience thesis holds (compare\nMcPherson 2012, 221–222, and Dreier 2015, 2019). Like the\noracle’s testimony, one might think that learning the truth of\nAnalytic would simply reinforce our confidence in the very thesis\n(Intuitive Metaphysical) that we were hoping to explain. \nMy exposition of these three worries (like the rest of this entry thus far) has\nfollowed the common practice of lumping together the notions of\nanalytic truth and conceptual truth. Terence Cuneo\nand Russ Shafer-Landau (2014) have argued that distinguishing these\ntwo notions permits them to develop an attractive form of moral\nrealism, and also enables them to explain the supervenience of the\nmoral properties. They distinguish analytic and conceptual truth as\nfollows: for a sentence to be analytically true is for it to\nbe true in virtue of the meanings of the terms that constitute it. By\ncontrast, for a proposition to be a conceptual truth is for\nit to be true wholly in virtue of the essences of its constituent\nconcepts (ibid., 410–11). Concepts, in turn, are to be\nunderstood as abstract non-mental objects. One has a propositional\nthought in virtue of being appropriately related to some of these\nobjects. \nCuneo and Shafer-Landau then offer what they call a ‘reversal\nargument’, which entails that some conceptual truths about\nmorality are ‘fact-makers’: that is, some of the facts\nabout the distribution of moral properties are grounded in facts about\nmoral concepts (ibid., 418–421). This puts them in a position to\navoid the complaint that I just made about Analytic: on their view,\nconceptual truths really do metaphysically explain (some) of the\nrelations between the moral and the base properties. They then propose\nthat such connections quite generally explain the supervenience of the\nmoral. \nIt is worth emphasizing the commitments of this ingenious proposal.\nConsider one central issue. Cuneo and Shafer-Landau argue for the\nexistence of several substantive-seeming conceptual truths about\nmorality. As they admit, their view is quite heterodox in virtue of\nthis. However, they nowhere claim that all necessary moral\ntruths can be explained as conceptual truths. That, of course, would\nbe a much stronger claim, and much harder to motivate. However,\nIntuitive Metaphysical is a quite general modal covariance thesis, and\nin light of this, only the stronger claim would suffice to explain its\ntruth. \nSeveral philosophers have suggested that we can offer ethical\nexplanations of the supervenience relation (Kramer 2009, Ch. 10; Olson\n2014, §5.1, Scanlon 2014, 38ff; other philosophers, such as\nDworkin 1996 and Blackburn 1998, 311 also appear committed to this\nidea; for discussion see Tiefensee 2014). For example, one might think\nthat the dictum treat like cases alike! is an ethical\nrequirement of ethical reasoning. Or one might think that all ethical\ntruths are grounded in certain fundamental ethical truths that are\nrelational: for example, a fundamental truth might be that it is wrong\nto torture someone purely for fun. This truth states a relationship\nbetween ethical and non-ethical properties. If all ethical facts are\nexplained by such fundamental ethical truths, then these truths could\nseemingly explain why there are supervenience relations between\nethical and base properties. \nOne worry about this strategy is that one might take a mark of ethical\nrealism to be commitment to a truthmaker thesis, according to which\nethical truths are metaphysically explained by (or grounded in) the\npatterns of instantiation of ethical properties. The ethical\nexplanation strategy seems to invert this intuitive order of\nexplanation, by having the distribution of ethical properties\nexplained by ethical truths. \nSuppose that we rejected this idea in an especially radical way,\ninsisting instead on the reverse order of metaphysical explanation\neverywhere. The nature of every property, we might say, is wholly\ngrounded in some relevant subset of the true propositions. Provided\nthat we can recover the idea of metaphysical explanation within this\nframework, we will be able to isolate the set of propositions that\nstate metaphysically unexplained necessary connections. And it is\nnatural to think that the brute necessities worry could be expressed\nwithin this framework as objecting to accepting such propositions. The\nproblem is that fundamental normative principles, as invoked\nin the ‘ethical explanation’ strategy, would seem to be of\nexactly the objectionable sort. \nAs the preceding sections have shown, philosophers have tried to\nextract a number of striking conclusions using ethical supervenience\nas a premise. Part of the motivation for these attempts is that\nethical supervenience is widely assumed to be a powerful dialectical\nweapon, such that if your view is incompatible with ethical\nsupervenience, it is in trouble. This section considers challenges to\nthis status. \nIt is now common to distinguish thick ethical concepts—like\ncourage—from thin ethical concepts—like\nought or good (for an introduction to thick ethical\nconcepts, see Roberts 2017). Courage seems like an ethical concept: we\nexpect each other to treat courage as a virtue and not a vice.\nHowever, competent use of thick ethical concepts seems to require\nrecognition that only certain sorts of grounds make an ascription of\nsuch a concept apt. To adapt Monty Python’s example, it seems\nconceptually inapt to say that Sir Robin was courageous in\nlight of running away from battle, even if we think that is what he\nought to have done. \nJonathan Dancy (1995, 278–9) and Debbie Roberts (2018) have\nsuggested that attention to thick ethical concepts casts doubt on\nethical supervenience. The core idea is this: it is true that there\nare no thin ethical differences between otherwise identical\ncircumstances. However, it is suggested that sometimes the thin\nethical properties of an action or event are best explained by citing\nthick ethical properties. And it is claimed that it is not at all\nclear that these thick ethical properties can always be explained in\npurely base terms (see especially Roberts 2017a).  \nA natural objection to this strategy is to point out that the\nsupervenience of the thick on the base properties is, if anything, far\nmore plausible than the supervenience of the thin. For example, it is\nvery hard to believe that two possible worlds could be wholly\nbase-identical, but be such that Doris’s action is brave in the\nfirst world, but not brave in the second. \n\n Section 2\n noted that there are few extended defenses of ethical supervenience.\nThis might suggest that the evidence for the supervenience is\noverwhelming. However, it might instead be a sign that supervenience\nis a dogma, accepted without adequate critical examination. This\nsection briefly explains two challenges to the epistemic credentials\nof ethical supervenience. \nJoseph Raz briefly suggests that the supervenience of the ethical does\nnot purport to explain much. And he suggests that this explanatory\npoverty gives us reason to doubt whether the ethical supervenes.\nAccording to Raz, ethical supervenience neither provides more specific\ntheses that allow us to concretely explain the ethical features of\nreality, nor guarantees that we can find such explanatory theses\n(2000, 54–5). If we assume that we should accept only those\ntheoretical claims that do substantial explanatory work, then this\ncasts doubt on ethical supervenience as a theoretical claim. \n\n Section 2\n suggested a different explanatory case for supervenience than the one\nRaz considers: general ethical supervenience theses serve to explain\nthe host of specific ethical supervenience facts that we notice. These\nfacts are perhaps not themselves explanatory. But they may seem\ndifficult to intelligibly deny, at least pending a developed moral\nepistemology that might adjudicate their epistemic credentials. \nAlison Hills (2009) argues that we can undermine the case for ethical\nsupervenience by granting that in many cases ethical difference\nwithout naturalistic difference seems inconceivable, and\narguing that we should not take inconceivability here to be a good\nguide to impossibility. She suggests that the appearance of\ninconceivability may be grounded in our unwillingness to engage in\ncertain distasteful imaginative exercises. \nHills bolsters this case by arguing that if we consider a\ncontroversial and low-stakes case—say, whether a certain lie\nmade with benevolent motives is permissible—we are able to\nconceive of such a lie being either permissible or impermissible. But,\nshe suggests, if we can conceive of it as being permissible, and as\nbeing impermissible, we have shown that we are able to conceive of two\nethically inconsistent possible worlds. Further, this low-stakes case\nis easier to conceive of than the possibility of Hitler being a moral\nparagon, and Hills suggests that this supports the idea that\nconceivability is grounded in our willingness to imagine certain\npossibilities, for we presumably have a stronger desire to avoid\nimagining Hitler as a moral paragon than we do to avoid imagining the\nlower-stakes case. \n\n Section 1.3\n showed that one of the crucial choice-points in theorizing ethical\nsupervenience is the strength of the modality of the supervenience\nrelation (conceptual? metaphysical? etc.). And\n Section 3\n and\n Section 4\n showed that the claim that the ethical supervenes with conceptual or\nmetaphysical necessity is the starting point for several influential\narguments. Gideon Rosen’s (2020) develops a view of the modal\nstrength of ethical supervenience that is intended to be strong enough\nto accommodate the intuitive appearances, while weak enough to be\ndialectically inert. \nThe heart of Rosen’s challenge is an argument that we can\ncharacterize and clearly regiment a notion of normative\nnecessity, which falls short of metaphysical necessity (i.e. at least\nsome normative necessities are metaphysically contingent), while still\nbeing quite strong, in the sense that in any counterfactual where one\nconsiders how things would be if we altered some non-normative fact,\nwe hold fixed the normative necessities. Rosen proposes that normative\nnecessity is the appropriate modality for ethical supervenience. If he\nis correct about this, most of the arguments from supervenience\ndiscussed so far would fail, as they tend to require ethical\nsupervenience to have either metaphysical or conceptual strength. \nEven with this alternative clearly stated, the strong metaphysical\nsupervenience of the ethical may seem especially plausible. But with\nhis account of normative necessity in hand, Rosen can make two points:\n(i) when we consider possibilities that violate the strong\nmetaphysical supervenience of the ethical, we are considering very\ndistant possibilities, where our modal judgments may not be\nparticularly trustworthy, and (ii) our judgments of metaphysical\nimpossibility of these scenarios might be explained by implicit\nconfusion derived from the fact that while these scenarios may be\nmetaphysically possible, they are normatively impossible. \nBy rejecting strong metaphysical supervenience, Rosen must reject the\nSidgwickian explanatory idea suggested in\n Section 2:\n that ethical supervenience reflects a commitment to rejecting brute\nethical contingency. One worry about Rosen’s strategy is that by\nembracing such contingency one permits an especially objectionable\nform of moral luck (Dreier, 2019). On Rosen’s view, there may be\na world that is relevantly non-ethically identical to this one in\nwhich my counterpart is ethically quite different: in the\nextreme case, it raises the specter that the specific loving attitudes\nthat I bear towards my child might have been evil, or even\njust a matter of utter ethical indifference. But it is hard to believe\nthat I am lucky that the very attitudes that I possess count\nas commendable rather than awful. (See Lange 2018 for another\nimportant challenge to Rosen’s argument). \nAnandi Hattiangadi (2018) offers a conceivability argument against the\nidea that the ethical supervenes with conceptual or metaphysical\nnecessity. The core idea is this. Mutually inconsistent ethical\nprinciples each appear to be perfectly conceivable. And in general,\nconceivability is a good guide to possibility. But if utilitarianism\nand Kantianism, say, are both true in some possible world otherwise\nlike ours, then the supervenience of the ethical fails. \nOne worry for Hattiangadi’s argument is that there seems to be a\nstraightforward way to contextualize the relevant conceivability\njudgments. Consider an analogy. I cannot remember the atomic number of\nplutonium. So it is conceivable to me that plutonium atoms have any of\na fairly wide range of numbers of protons. But I do not think\nthat it is possible both that one plutonium atom has 100 protons, and\nthat some other possible plutonium atom has 110 protons. If any\nplutonium atom has 100 protons, they all do. (This stems from my\nempirically-derived belief that number of protons is essential to the\nnature of plutonium). Similarly, I can entertain the possibility that\nutilitarianism is true, or that it is false. But what is hard to wrap\none’s head around is the idea that there might be worlds just\nlike this one in all base respects, which vary with respect to whether\nutilitarianism is true. \nThis section considers a final possibility: accepting ethical\nsupervenience, but denying on general grounds that it can play a\nsignificant role in the sorts of arguments discussed in\n Section 3\n and\n Section 4.\n Consider two ways of implementing this idea. \nFirst, recall from\n Section 1.1\n the difficulties of identifying a plausible and uncontroversial\naccount of what the ethical supervenes on. Nicolas Sturgeon suggests\nthat one conclusion to draw from these difficulties is that there is\nno dialectically significant ethical supervenience thesis. For\nexample, he accepts the supervenience of the ethical on the natural,\nbut he suggests that his reasons for accepting it are just his reasons\nfor accepting ethical naturalism (2009, 61). He argues that\nphilosophers who reject naturalism are likewise in a position to\nreject the supervenience of the ethical on the natural (2009,\n62–7). \nThere are two important potential ways of replying to this argument.\nFirst, one might seek a non-parochial argument for ethical\nsupervenience, such as the one suggested in\n Section 2.\n However, this might not be fully successful: as noted in\n Section 2,\n discussions of supervenience seem unavoidably to involve\ncontroversial philosophical commitments, for example to various\nspecies of modality or to philosophically interesting conceptual\ntruths. Second, one might be able to find dialectically effective\nparochial arguments. For example, Sturgeon himself seeks to make such\nan argument against the non-cognitivist (2009, 83–88). To take\nanother example, most ethical non-naturalists grant at least the\nstrong metaphysical supervenience of the ethical on the non-ethical,\nwhich allows the brute necessity challenge posed in\n Section 4\n to have dialectical force against them. However, some philosophers\nhave suggested that the complaint about brute necessities is itself a\nparochial one. For example, Terence Horgan and Mark Timmons (1992,\n227) suggest that the objectionability of brute supervenience\nconnections is a distinctively naturalistic commitment. This\nthought has been embraced by some non-naturalists. For example, Nick\nZangwill (1997, 509) suggests that the bruteness of ethical\nsupervenience can simply be embraced. \nA second way to deflate the dialectical force of ethical supervenience\nis to grant that explaining it is a good thing to do, but deny that\nthis is a particularly weighty consideration in the context of\ntheory-choice (compare Enoch 2011, 147–8). The issues here are\nfar from clear, but it is worth emphasizing two costs to this reply.\nFirst, as Gideon Rosen (2020) points out, embracing brute ethical\nsupervenience is inconsistent with the essentialist account of\nmodality discussed above. (Recall that according to this account, all\nnecessary truths are explained by facts about essences). Because the\nessentialist account is one of the most powerful and well-developed\naccounts of modality, embracing inconsistency with it offers up a\nsignificant hostage to metaphysical fortune. Second, the avoidance of\nbrute necessary connections seems to be a central part of metaphysical\nmethodology. Even if modal structure is not the most fundamental\nmetaphysical structure, it is typically treated as a good guide to\nsuch structure (Kment, 2015). It is hard to see why this would be so\nunless necessary connections disclosed some deeper explanatory\nrelationship. This suggests that the philosopher who wishes to find in\nethics an exception to this principle may need to provide a clear\nmethodological reason for doing so.","contact.mail":"dr.tristram@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
