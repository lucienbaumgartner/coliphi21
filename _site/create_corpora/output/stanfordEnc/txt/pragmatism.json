This general idea has attracted a remarkably rich and at\ntimes contrary range of interpretations, including: that all\nphilosophical concepts should be tested via scientific\nexperimentation, that a claim is true if and only if it is useful\n(relatedly: if a philosophical theory does not contribute directly to\nsocial progress then it is not worth much), that experience consists\nin transacting with rather than representing nature, that articulate\nlanguage rests on a deep bed of shared human practices that can never\nbe fully ‘made explicit’. \n\n\nPragmatism originated in the United States around 1870, and now\npresents a growing third alternative to both analytic and\n‘Continental’ philosophical traditions worldwide. Its\nfirst generation was initiated by the so-called ‘classical\npragmatists’ Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who first\ndefined and defended the view, and his close friend and colleague\nWilliam James (1842–1910), who further developed and ably\npopularized it. James’ Harvard colleague Josiah Royce\n(1855–1916), although officially allied with absolute idealism,\nproved a valuable interlocutor for many of these ideas. A significant\ninfluence in those early years was the scientific revolution then\ntaking place around evolutionary theory, of which first generation\npragmatists were keen observers and sometime participants (Pearce\n2020). These pragmatists focused significantly on theorising inquiry,\nmeaning and the nature of truth, although James put these themes to\nwork exploring truth in religion. A second (still termed\n‘classical’) generation turned pragmatist philosophy more\nexplicitly towards politics, education and other dimensions of social\nimprovement, under the immense influence of John Dewey\n(1859–1952) and his friend Jane Addams (1860–1935) –\nwho invented the profession of social work as an expression of\npragmatist ideas (and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931). Also\nof considerable importance at this time was George Herbert Mead\n(1863–1931), who contributed significantly to the social\nsciences, developing pragmatist perspectives upon the relations\nbetween the self and the community (Mead 1934), whilst philosophy of\nrace was germinated by pioneering African-American philosophers W.E.B\nDu Bois (1868–1963) and Alain Locke (1885–1954), who also\nengaged in productive dialogue with one another. As the progressive\nDeweyan ‘New Deal’ era passed away and the US moved into\nthe Cold War, pragmatism’s influence was challenged, as analytic\nphilosophy blossomed and became the dominant methodological\norientation in most Anglo-American philosophy departments.\nTransitional or ‘third generation’ figures included C.I.\nLewis (1883–1964) and W.V.O. Quine (1908–2000); although\nthese philosophers developed a number of pragmatist themes, their\nanalytic allegiance may be seen in their significant focus on theory\nof knowledge as first philosophy (which Dewey deprecated as ‘the\nepistemological industry’).\n\n\nFollowing this dip in popularity, since the 1970s the pragmatist\ntradition has undergone a significant revival. Richard Rorty\n(1931–2007) turned consciously to pragmatism to rectify what he\nsaw as mainstream epistemology’s crucial mistake: naively\nconceiving of language and thought as ‘mirroring’ the\nworld. Rorty’s bold and iconoclastic attacks on this\n‘representationalism’ birthed a so-called\nneopragmatism to which a number of influential recent\nphilosophers have contributed (e.g. Hilary Putnam, Robert Brandom and\nHuw Price). Other pragmatists have objected to Rorty’s blithe\ndismissal of truth as a topic better left undiscussed (Rorty 1982),\nand have sought to rehabilitate classical pragmatist ideals of\nobjectivity (e.g. Susan Haack, Christopher Hookway and Cheryl Misak).\nThese philosophers are now sometimes referred to as New\nPragmatists. Yet others have worked to place pragmatist ideas in a\nbroader Western philosophical context, for instance tracing\nPeirce’s significant debt to Kant (Apel 1974, Gava 2014), and\nconnections between pragmatism and 19th century idealism (Margolis\n2010, Stern 2009). Meanwhile, classical pragmatism’s progressive\nsocial ideals lived on in some quarters, with notable contributions to\nphilosophy of race made by Cornel West, who advanced a prophetic\npragmatism drawing on both Christian and Marxian thought, and\nshowcasing the earlier contributions of Du Bois and Locke (e.g. West\n1989). A number of other liberatory philosophical projects in areas\nsuch as feminism (Seigfried 1996), ecology (Alexander 2013), Native\nAmerican philosophy (Pratt 2002) and Latin American philosophy (Pappas\n1998) also currently look to the pragmatist tradition as their\nphilosophical home. \n\n\nMeanwhile, increasingly pragmatism’s intellectual centre of\ngravity is moving out of North America, with vibrant research networks\nappearing in South America, Scandinavia and more recently central\nEurope and China. \n\n\nThe core of pragmatism as Peirce originally conceived it was the\nPragmatic Maxim, a rule for clarifying the meaning of hypotheses by\ntracing their ‘practical consequences’ – their\nimplications for experience in specific situations. For Peirce and\nJames, a key application of the Maxim was clarifying the concept of\ntruth. This produced a distinctive epistemological outlook: a\nfallibilist, anti-Cartesian explication of the norms that govern\ninquiry. Within that broad outlook, though, early pragmatists split\nsignificantly over questions of realism broadly conceived\n– essentially, whether pragmatism should conceive itself as a\nscientific philosophy holding monism about truth (following Peirce),\nor a more broad-based alethic pluralism (following James and Dewey).\nThis dispute was poignantly emblematized in arguments between Peirce\nand James which led Peirce to rename his view pragmaticism,\npresenting this clarified viewpoint to the world as his new\n‘baby’ which was, he hoped, ‘ugly enough to be safe\nfrom kidnappers’ (EP2: 355).\n\n\nThe first part of this entry is devoted to the classical\npragmatists’ distinctive methods, and how they give rise to an\noriginal a posteriori epistemology. After that we will briefly\nexplore some of the many other areas of philosophy in which rich\npragmatist contributions have been made.\n\nPragmatism’s key ideas originated in discussions at a so-called\n‘Metaphysical Club’ that met in Harvard around 1870. (For\na popular history of this group, see Menand 1998.) Peirce and James\nparticipated in these discussions along with some other philosophers,\npsychologists and philosophically inclined lawyers. Peirce then\ndeveloped these ideas in publications from the 1870s, and they\nachieved prominence through a series of public lectures given by James\nin 1898. Both James and Peirce used ‘pragmatism’ as the\nname of a method, principle, or ‘maxim’ for clarifying\nconcepts and hypotheses and for identifying empty disputes, though we\nshall see significant differences in how they understood it. \nWhen William James published a series of lectures on\n‘Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking’ in\n1907, he began by identifying ‘The Present Dilemma in\nPhilosophy’ (1907: 9ff), a fundamental and apparently\nirresoluble clash between two ways of thinking, which he promised\npragmatism would overcome. James begins by observing that the history\nof philosophy is ‘to a great extent that of a certain clash of\nhuman temperaments’: the ‘tough-minded’ and the\n‘tender-minded’. The tough-minded have an empiricist\ncommitment to experience and going by ‘the facts’, while\nthe tender-minded prefer a priori principles which appeal to\nratiocination. The tender-minded tend to be idealistic, optimistic and\nreligious, believing in free will, while the tough-minded are\nmaterialist, pessimistic, irreligious, dogmatic and fatalistic. \nBy the early twentieth century, James notes, ‘our children\n… are almost born scientific’ (1907: 14f). But this has\nnot weakened religious belief. People need a philosophy that is both\nempiricist in its adherence to facts yet finds room for faith. But all\nthat is on offer is ‘an empirical philosophy that is not\nreligious enough and a religious philosophy that is not empirical\nenough…’ (1907: 15f). The challenge is to show how to\nreconcile ‘the scientific loyalty to facts’ with\n‘the old confidence in human values and the resultant\nspontaneity, whether of the religious or of the romantic type.’\nPragmatism is presented as the ‘mediating philosophy’: we\nneed to show how adherence to tough-minded epistemic standards does\nnot prevent our adopting the kind of worldview to which the\ntender-minded aspire. Once we use what he introduced as the\n‘pragmatic method’ to clarify our understanding of truth,\nof free will, or of religious belief the disputes—which we\ndespaired of settling intellectually—begin to dissolve. William\nJames thus presented pragmatism as a ‘method for settling\nmetaphysical disputes that might otherwise be interminable.’\n(1907: 28) Unless some ‘practical difference’ would follow\nfrom one or the other side’s being correct, the dispute is\nidle. \nThe lectures explained this with a memorable illustration. On a visit\nto the mountains, James’ friends engage in a ‘ferocious\nmetaphysical dispute’ about a squirrel that was hanging on one\nside of a tree trunk while a human observer was standing on the other\nside: \nJames proposed that which answer is correct depends on what you\n‘practically mean’ by ‘going round’. If you\nmean passing from north of the squirrel, east, south, then west, then\nthe answer to the question is ‘yes’. If, on the other\nhand, you mean in front of him, to his right, behind him, to his left,\nand then in front of him again, then the answer is ‘no’.\nAfter pragmatic clarification disambiguates the question, all dispute\ncomes to an end. So James offers his pragmatism as a technique for\nclarifying concepts and hypotheses so that metaphysical disputes that\nappear irresoluble will be dissolved. A good example is the dispute\nbetween free will and determinism: once we compare the practical\nconsequences of both positions we find no conflict. As James admitted,\nhe explained the pragmatic method through examples rather than a\ndetailed analysis of what it involves. He did little to explain\nexactly what ‘practical consequences’ are. He also made no\nclaim to originality: ‘Pragmatism represents a perfectly\nfamiliar attitude in philosophy, the empiricist attitude’,\nalthough he acknowledged that it did so ‘in a more radical and\nin a less objectionable form than it has ever yet assumed’\n(1907: 31). It shared with other forms of empiricism an\n‘anti-intellectualist tendency’ (ibid), and it recognized\nthat theories (and presumably concepts) should be viewed as\n‘instruments, not answers to enigmas’. \nPeirce made this canonical statement of his Pragmatic Maxim in\n‘How to Make our Ideas Clear’: \nThis offers a distinctive method for becoming clear about the meaning\nof concepts and the hypotheses which contain them. We clarify a\nhypothesis by identifying the practical consequences we should expect\nif it is true. This raises some questions. First: what, exactly is the\ncontent of this maxim? What sort of thing does it recognize as a\npractical consequence? Second, what use does such a maxim have?\nPeirce’s first simple illustrative example urges that what we\nmean by calling something hard is that ‘it will not be\nscratched by many other substances.’ In this way, then, I can\nuse the concept hard in certain contexts when I am wondering\nwhat to do, and absent such contexts, the concept is empty. The\nprinciple has something of a verificationist character: ‘our\nidea of anything is our idea of its sensible effects’\n(EP1: 132). However the use of the phrase ‘practical\nconsequences’ suggests that these are to be understood as having\nimplications for what we will or should do. This is clear\nfrom Peirce’s later formulations, for example: \nSo, for instance, if I want to break a window by throwing something\nthrough it, then I need an object which is hard, not soft. It is\nimportant that, as Peirce hints here, the consequences we are\nconcerned with are general and intelligible: we are to look\nfor laws that govern the behaviour of hard things and show how such\nmodes of behaviour can make a difference to what is rational for us to\ndo. \nJames never worked out his understanding of ‘practical\nconsequences’ as fully as Peirce did, and he does not share\nPeirce’s restriction of these consequences to general patterns\nof behaviour. Sometimes he writes as if the practical consequences of\na proposition can simply be effects upon the individual believer: if\nreligious belief makes me feel better, then that contributes to the\npragmatic clarification of ‘God exists’. James also hopes\nthat the attempt to clarify metaphysical hypotheses will reveal that\nsome propositions are empty or, more important, that, as in the\nsquirrel example, some apparent disagreements are unreal. Peirce sees\nuses for his maxim beyond those James had in mind. He insisted that it\nwas a logical principle, in a broad sense of logic which\nincludes scientific methodology. So for instance he used it to clarify\nconcepts central to scientific reasoning such as probability,\ntruth, and reality. (We shall discuss his views on\ntruth and reality further below.) Pragmatism, described by Peirce as a\n‘laboratory philosophy’, shows us how we test theories by\ncarrying out experiments in the expectation that if the hypothesis is\nnot true, then the experiment will fail to have some predetermined\nsensible effect. \nPeirce’s description of his maxim as a logical principle is\nreflected in passages where he presents it as a development of a\ndistinction that had been a staple of traditional logic texts, and\nfamiliar to readers of Descartes, between ideas that are\nclear and distinct (EP1: 126f). Peirce understood\nthe first grade of clarity about the meaning of a concept as being\nable to identify instances of it, without necessarily being able to\nsay how. He then took his philosophical contemporaries to hold that\nthe highest grade of clarity, distinctness, is obtained when we can\nanalyze a concept into its elements by providing a verbal definition\n(or, in more recent terminology, necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor its application). Peirce complained that ‘nothing new is\never learned by analyzing definitions’, unless we already have a\nclear understanding of the defining terms. He therefore announced that\nthe Pragmatic Maxim enabled a higher (‘third’) grade of\nclarity, that supplemented the verbal definition with a description of\nhow the concept is employed in practice.  \nAs well as treating the Pragmatic Maxim as part of a constructive\naccount of the norms that govern inquiry, Peirce, like James, gave it\na negative role as a tool for demonstrating the emptiness of a\npriori metaphysics. In section 3.1 we shall see how pragmatic\nclarification of reality may be used to undermine a flawed\n‘nominalistic’ conception of reality that led to the\n‘copy theory of truth’, problematic Cartesian\ncertainty-seeking strategies in epistemology, and Kant’s concept\nof a ‘thing in itself’. A more vivid non-logical example\nof using the maxim to undermine spurious metaphysical ideas was\nPeirce’s early argument that the Catholic understanding of\ntransubstantiation was empty and incoherent. Since all we mean by\nwine is something that has certain distinctive effects upon\nthe senses, ‘to talk of something as having all the sensible\ncharacters of wine, yet being in reality blood, is senseless\njargon’ (EP1: 131f). It is important to note, however, that the\nmaxim is in the end only a tool for clarifying meaning; not\nPeirce’s theory of meaning proper. This is to be found in his\ntheory of signs or semiotic, which is discussed below (4.4).\n \nPeirce and James differed in how they applied their respective\npragmatisms to clarifying the concept of truth.\nPeirce’s account of truth is presented as a means to\nunderstanding a concept that he claimed was vital for the method of\nscience: reality (3.1). James used his account to defend\npluralism about truth (3.2). \nThe final section of ‘How to Make our Ideas Clear’\npromises to consider a fundamental logical conception,\nreality. This concept seems clear: ‘every child\nuses it with perfect confidence, never dreaming that he does not\nunderstand it.’ Thus it reaches Peirce’s first level of\nmeaning-clarity. A (second-level) verbal definition of the concept is\nalso readily forthcoming: ‘we may define the real as that whose\ncharacters are independent of what anybody may think them to\nbe.’ But, Peirce announces, we shall need to apply the Pragmatic\nMaxim if our idea of reality is to be ‘perfectly clear’.\nAt this stage the concept of truth enters the discussion:\nPeirce claims that the object represented in a true proposition is our\nbest understanding of the real. So we have to turn to his remarks\nabout truth to see how the mind-independence alleged in the abstract\ndefinition of reality is to be operationalized and thus properly\nunderstood from a pragmatist perspective. \nHis pragmatic clarification of truth is expressed as follows: \nSeven years earlier, in a review of a new edition of the writings of\nBerkeley, Peirce had described this way of thinking as the\n‘realist conception of reality’ (EP1:88–9), in\ncontrast with a ‘nominalist conception of reality’ which\nmany early modern philosophers took for granted. Nominalists assume\nthat the real can only be the antecedent cause of singular sensations\nwhich provide our evidence for beliefs about the external world. This\nnaturally leads to a certain (age-old) solipsistic skepticism\nconcerning whether a person can gain knowledge that transcends their\nown perceptions and epistemic perspective. Peirce’s pragmatist\nclarification of truth offers an alternative conceptualization of\n‘being constrained by reality’, in terms of\nconsequent convergence of opinion, through the process of\ninquiry, rather than as an antecedent cause of sensations. \nAll this has led Peirce’s account of truth to be expressed in\nthe slogan: truth is the end of inquiry, where\n‘end’ is to be understood not as a ‘finish’\n(some point in time when all human questions will be settled) but as a\ngoal, telos or final cause. This original understanding of truth has\nfaced challenges that it is ‘too realist’ insofar as it\ntakes for granted that inquiry will converge on just one answer to any\ngiven question. Here Bertrand Russell asked, ‘Is this an\nempirical generalization from the history of research? Or is it an\noptimistic belief in the perfectibility of man?’, concluding,\n‘Whatever interpretation we adopt, we seem committed to some\nvery rash assertion.’ (1939: 146). Similarly, Quine wrote,\n‘…we have no reason to suppose that man’s surface\nirritations even unto eternity admit of any one systematization that\nis scientifically better or simpler than all possible others’\n(1960: 23). However, later in life Peirce urged that the hypothesis of\nmonistic convergence is best viewed as a regulative hope. In\n1908, Peirce wrote to a friend, ‘I do not say that it is\ninfallibly true that there is any belief to which a person would come\nif he were to carry his inquiries far enough. I only say that that\nalone is what I call Truth’ (cited Haack 1976: 246).  \nAt the same time, others have criticised Peirce’s account of\ntruth for not being realist enough, due to its ‘internal\nrealist’ definition of truth in terms of belief and inquiry. Can\nthere not be claims which no-one ever inquires into or believes, which\nare nonetheless true? What about ‘lost facts’, such as the\nnumber of cakes on a tray during a long-ago party (Johnston 2003: 91)?\nHere Peirce arguably doubles down on his fallibilism (Legg 2014: 211).\nHow can we be sure that no amount of inquiry will settle such\nmatters? \nThe objectivism of Peirce’s account of truth derives not from a\nworld entirely external to our minds (a famously difficult thing to\nknow), but from the potential infinity of the community of\ninquiry, which exposes all of our beliefs to future correction:\n‘reality is independent, not necessarily of thought in general,\nbut only of what you or I or any finite number of [persons] may think\nabout it…’ (EP1: 139). By means of this mathematical\nanalysis, Peirce deftly synthesises insights from traditional realisms\nand idealisms (Legg 2014: 212; Lane 2018).  \nJames departed from Peirce in claiming that pragmatism was itself a\ntheory of truth. And his writings on this topic rapidly became\nnotorious. They are characteristically lively, offering contrasting\nformulations, engaging slogans, and intriguing claims which often seem\nto fly in the face of common sense. We can best summarize his view\nthrough his own words: \n‘The true’, to put it very briefly, is only the\nexpedient in the way of our thinking, just as ‘the right’\nis only the expedient in the way of our behaving. Expedient in\nalmost any fashion; and expedient in the long run and on the whole, of\ncourse. (1907: 106) \nOther formulations fill this out by giving a central role to\nexperience: \nAny idea upon which we can ride …; any idea that will carry us\nprosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,\nlinking things satisfactorily, working securely, saving labor; is true\nfor just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally.\n(1907: 34) \nThis might be taken to suggest that beliefs are made true by the fact\nthat they enable us to make accurate predictions of the future run of\nexperience, but other passages suggest that the ‘goodness of\nbelief’ can take other forms. James assures us that it can\ncontribute to the truth of a theological proposition that it has\n‘a value for concrete life’ (1907: 40); and this can occur\nbecause the idea of God possesses a majesty which can ‘yield\nreligious comfort to a most respectable class of minds’\n(1907:40). This suggests that a belief can be made true by the fact\nthat holding it contributes to our happiness and fulfilment. \nThe kind of passages just noted may seem to support Bertrand\nRussell’s famous objection that James is committed to the truth\nof “Santa Claus exists” (Russell 1946, p, 772). This is\nunfair; at best, James is committed to the claim that the happiness\nthat belief in Santa Claus provides is truth-relevant. James\ncould say that the belief was ‘good for so much’ but it\nwould only be ‘wholly true’ if it did not ‘clash\nwith other vital benefits’. It is easy to see that, unless it is\nsomehow insulated from the broader effects of acting upon it, belief\nin Santa Claus could lead to a host of experiential surprises and\ndisappointments. \nThe pragmatists saw their epistemology as providing a return to common\nsense and experience and thus as rejecting a flawed philosophical\nheritage which had distorted the work of earlier thinkers. The errors\nto be overcome include Cartesianism, Nominalism, and the ‘copy\ntheory of truth’: these are all related. \nThe roots of pragmatism’s anti-skepticism can be found in\nPeirce’s early (1868) paper ‘Some Consequences of Four\nIncapacities’ (EP1: 28–30). Here he identifies\n‘Cartesianism’ as a philosophical pathology that lost\nsight of certain insights that were fundamental to scholastic thought\n(for all its faults), and – he argued – more suited to the\nphilosophical needs of his own time. The paper begins by identifying\nfour problematic teachings of modern philosophy: \nThe first, and in many ways most important of these Cartesian\nteachings was the method of universal doubt. We should retain beliefs\nonly if they are absolutely certain and we are unable to doubt them.\nThe test of this certainty, as Peirce next points out, lies in whether\nthe individual consciousness is satisfied. Importantly, this\nself-examination includes reflection on hypothetical possibilities: we\ncannot trust our perceptual beliefs, for example, because we cannot\nrule out that they might be produced by a dream, or an evil demon.\n(See Hookway 2012, chapters 2,3.) The initial pragmatist response to\nthis is that it is a strategy that in practice we cannot carry out\neffectively, and there is no reason to adopt it anyway. Peirce claims\nthat any attempt to adopt the method of doubt will be an exercise in\nself-deception because we possess a variety of certainties which it\ndoes not occur to us can be questioned. So what is produced\nwill not be ‘real doubt’; these beliefs will lurk in the\nbackground, influencing our reflection. Peirce urges us not to\n‘pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our\nhearts’ (EP1: 29).  \nIt is necessary to separate some different threads in his argument\nhere. First, there is something unnatural about the Cartesian\nstrategy. Inquiries normally occur within a context: we address\nparticular questions or problems, relying on background certainties\nthat it does not occur to us to doubt. The Cartesian suggestion that\nwe should begin by trying to doubt everything appears to be an attempt\nto step outside of this. Second, the Cartesian strategy requires us to\nreflect upon each of our beliefs and ask what reason we have for\nholding it; skeptical challenges are then used to question the\nadequacy of these reasons. This is again at odds with normal practice.\nMany of our familiar certainties are such that we cannot offer any\nconcrete or convincing reason for believing them. We tend to treat our\nestablished beliefs as innocent until ‘proven guilty’. The\nmere lack of a conclusive reason for belief does not itself provide us\nwith a reason for doubt. \nDescartes, of course, might have conceded this, but responded that the\nrevision is required because once we allow error to enter our\nbelief-corpus we may be unable to escape from its damaging effects.\nHis was a time of methodological ferment, and he appreciated how many\nfalse beliefs he himself had acquired from his teachers. The\npragmatist response here is to question some of Descartes’\nassumptions about how we reason and form beliefs. First, his strategy\nis individualist and ‘to make single individuals absolute judges\nof truth is most pernicious’. Peirce noted that the natural\nsciences which were so conspicuously successful in Descartes’\nday took a very different approach: \nPeirce also questions Descartes’ understanding of reasoning in\nholding that we may rely on ‘a single thread of inference’\nthat is no stronger than its weakest link: \nWhere the Cartesian holds that unless we begin from premises of which\nwe can be absolutely certain we may never reach the truth, the\npragmatist emphasises that, when we do go wrong, further discussion\nand investigation can identify and eliminate errors, which is our best\nhope for escaping their damaging effects. The possibility of error\nprovides us with reason to be ‘contrite fallibilists’,\nrather than skeptics. The focus of epistemological inquiry should not\nbe on showing how we can possess absolute certainty, but on how\nwe can develop self-correcting methods of inquiry that make\nfallible progress. \nWilliam James makes similar observations. In ‘The Will to\nBelieve’, he reminds us that we have two cognitive desiderata:\nto obtain truth, and to avoid error (James 1897: 30). The harder we\ntry to avoid error, the more likely it is that we will miss out on\ntruth; and the more strenuously we search for truth, the more likely\nwe are to let in error. The method of doubt may make sense in\nspecial cases where enormous weight is given to avoiding error, even\nif that means loss of truth, but only there. Once we recognize that we\nare making a practical and forced decision about the relative\nimportance of two goods, the Cartesian strategy no longer\nappears the only rational one. Later, Dewey in The Quest for\nCertainty similarly urged that a focus on eliminating all error\nfrom our beliefs is both doomed and destructive, with the added twist\nof a social diagnosis of the quest itself: the uncertainty, pain and\nfear of much early human life led to the erection of\n‘priestly’ forms of knowledge which in promising to\nintercede with a Heavenly stability, sundered a priori theory\nfrom a posteriori practice, thereby enabling the knowing\nclasses to insulate themselves from a more humble (and realistic)\nempiricism. The ‘quest’ continues, however, in many\ndebates in contemporary mainstream epistemology. \nPragmatist epistemologies often explore how we can carry out inquiries\nin a self-controlled and fruitful way. (Where much analytic\nepistemology centres around the concept of knowledge,\nconsidered as an idealised end-point of human thought, pragmatist\nepistemology centres around the concept of inquiry, considered\nas the process of knowledge-seeking and how we can improve it.) So\npragmatists often provide rich accounts of the capacities or virtues\nthat we must possess in order to inquire well, and the rules or\nguiding principles that we should adopt. A canonical account is\nPeirce’s classic early paper “The Fixation of\nBelief”. Here Peirce states that inquiry is a struggle to\nreplace doubt with ‘settled belief’, and that the only\nmethod of inquiry that can make sense of the fact that at least some\nof us are disturbed by inconsistent beliefs, and will subsequently\nreflect upon which methods of fixing belief are correct is\nthe Method of Science, which draws on the Pragmatic Maxim\ndescribed above. This contrasts with three other methods of fixing\nbelief: i) refusing to consider evidence contrary to one’s\nfavored beliefs (the Method of Tenacity), ii) accepting an\ninstitution’s dictates (the Method of Authority), iii)\ndeveloping the most rationally coherent or elegant-seeming belief-set\n(the A Priori Method). Notable recent reinterpretations and\ndefenses of Peircean pragmatist epistemology include (Haack 1993 and\nCooke 2007). (See also Skagestad 1981.) \nDewey’s conception of inquiry, found in his Logic: the\nTheory of Inquiry is also rich, and arguably more radical than\nPeirce’s in its underlying ontology (ED2: 169–79). Dewey\nsees inquiry as beginning with a problem; it aims for ‘the\ncontrolled or directed transformation of an indeterminate situation\ninto one that is so determinate in its constituent distinctions and\nrelations as to convert the elements of the original situation into a\nunified whole’ (ED2: 171). As John E. Smith notes, where\n‘Peirce aimed at “fixing” belief, Dewey aimed at\n“fixing” the situation’ (1978: 98). It is important\nto note that here the situation is objectively indeterminate,\nand is itself transformed by inquiry. The ‘pattern of\ninquiry’ that Dewey describes is common to the\ninformation-gathering of animals, practical problem solving, common\nsense investigations of our surroundings and scientific inquiry. He\nrecognizes that when we face a problem, our first task is to\nunderstand it through describing its elements and identifying their\nrelations. Identifying a concrete question that we need to answer is a\nsign that we are making progress. And the ‘logical forms’\nwe use in the course of inquiry are understood as ideal instruments,\ntools that help us to transform things and resolve our problem. The\ncontinuities Dewey finds between different kinds of inquiry are\nevidence of his naturalism and his recognition that forms of\nscientific investigation can guide us in all areas of our lives. All\nthe pragmatists, but most of all Dewey, challenge the sharp dichotomy\nthat other philosophers draw between theoretical beliefs and practical\ndeliberations. In some sense, all inquiry is practical, concerned with\ntransforming and evaluating the features of situations in which we\nfind ourselves. Shared inquiry directed at resolving social and\npolitical problems or indeterminacies was also central to\nDewey’s conception of the good life and, relatedly, the\ndemocratic ideal. (Recently other pragmatists, closer to Peirce than\nDewey, have developed this idea: see for instance Talisse 2008; Misak\n1999; Westbrook 1991.) \nThe Pragmatic Maxim suggests that pragmatism is a form of empiricism\n(an idea recently explored further in Wilson 2016). Our ability to\nthink about so-called external things, and steadily improve our\nunderstanding of them, rests upon our experience. Yet most pragmatists\nadopted accounts of experience and perception radically different from\nthe views of modern empiricists from John Locke and David Hume to\nRudolf Carnap, as well as the ‘intuition’ posited by Kant.\nThe established view interpreted experience as what is sometimes\n(following C.I. Lewis and Wilfrid Sellars) called ‘the\ngiven’: we are passive recipients of determinate and singular\n‘sense-data’. Experience provides raw material for\nknowledge, but does not itself have content informed by concepts,\npractical needs, or anything else non-sensory. Our only contact with\nthe external world is through receiving such experiences. So this way\nof thinking about experience can easily lead to skepticism about the\nso-called ‘external world’. \nIn different ways, Peirce, James, and Dewey all argued that experience\nis far richer than this, and that earlier philosophers were mistaken\nto claim that we could identify ‘experiences’ or\n‘sense-data’ as antecedents to, or separable constituents\nof, cognition. We can begin with James’ radical\nempiricism, of which he said that ‘the establishment of the\npragmatist theory of truth [was] a step of first-rate importance in\nmaking [it] prevail’ (1909: 6f). The connection with pragmatism\nis evident from the fundamental ‘postulate’ of radical\nempiricism: ‘the only things that shall be debatable among\nphilosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from\nexperience’. But this requires that experience be newly\nunderstood. First, he announced that ‘the relations between\nthings, conjunctive as well as disjunctive, are just as much matters\nof direct particular experience, neither more so nor less so, than the\nthings themselves.’ And, second, he concludes that ‘the\nparts of experience hold together from next to next by relations that\nare themselves parts of experience. The directly apprehended universe\nneeds, in short, no extraneous trans-empirical connective support, but\npossesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous\nstructure.’ \nPeirce too emphasizes the continuous character of perceptual\nexperience, and adds that we directly perceive external things as\nexternal, as ‘other’, that we can perceive necessary\nconnections between events, and that experience contains elements of\ngenerality (citing a picture of a connected series of circles which\ncan be seen as a stone wall, in the manner of\nWittgenstein’s famous duck-rabbit dual diagram). Around\n1902–3, Peirce developed a complex and original theory of\nperception which combines a percept, which is entirely\nnon-cognitive, with a perceptual judgement, which is structured\npropositionally and lies in the space of reasons. In this way he seeks\nto capture how perception is both immediately felt and\ntruth-evaluable. In contrast to standard British Empiricist analyses\nof the relation between impressions and ideas, Peirce does not claim\nthat a perceptual judgment copies its percept. Rather, it\nindexes it, just as a weather-cock indicates the direction of\nthe wind. Although percept and perceptual judgment are intrinsically\ndissimilar, over time certain habits of association between the two\nare reinforced, leading them to (literally) grow in our minds and link\nwith other habits. This enables percepts and perceptual judgments to\nmutually inform one another, to the point where every perception is\nfallible and subject to reinterpretation in the light of future\nperceptions (Legg 2017). The end result is that, as Peirce puts it, in\nstark contrast to the accepted understanding of experience as\n‘given’: ‘[n]othing at all…is absolutely\nconfrontitional’, although, ‘the confrontitional is\ncontinually flowing in upon us’ (CP 7.653).  \nDewey’s account of experience, which is central to his entire\nphilosophy, contributes an additional twist. Like Peirce, he thought\nthat experience was ‘full of inference’, but he arguably\ntook the notion further from the mere contents of individual\nconsciousness than any previous pragmatist. For Dewey, experience is a\nprocess through which we transact with our surroundings and meet our\nneeds. He wrote: \nWhat we experience is shaped by our habits of expectation and there is\nno basis for extracting from this complex process the kind of\n‘thin given’ beloved of sense datum theorists. We\nexperience all sorts of objects, events and processes, and just as\nexperience is inextricable from the ‘external’ world of\nthings, Nature (its co-ordinate concept: what is experienced)\nis inextricable from the ‘internal’ world of concepts. \nIn sharp contrast to Dewey, neopragmatism no longer takes experience\nas an explicit philosophical theme. Rorty began his pre-pragmatist\nphilosophical career as an eliminative materialist, and the view\nsurvives in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, newly\nbolstered by Sellarsian concerns about the ‘myth of the\ngiven’. On this basis, Rorty declares that ‘Dewey should\nhave dropped the term “experience” rather than redefining\nit… He should have agreed with Peirce that a great gulf divides\nsensation and cognition, [and] decided that cognition was possible\nonly for language users…’ (Rorty 1998: 297). Similarly,\nBrandom focusses his attention exclusively on linguistic meaning\n(albeit in this case qua rationalist), and has famously ruled\nthat (as ‘blasphemy’ was to Oscar Wilde)\n‘experience’ is ‘not one of his words’\n(Brandom 2011: 197). This neopragmatist neglect of one of classical\npragmatism’s central concepts has become a major point of\ncontention on the part of many New Pragmatists (e.g. Koopman 2007;\nLevine 2010, 2012; Sachs 2015). \nHaving discussed pragmatists’ emphases upon the activity of\ninquiry and the thickness of experience, we turn to their views about\nthe nature of thought. It has been common for philosophers to assume\nthat the ‘content’ of a thought, judgment or proposition\nis a kind of intrinsic property that it possesses. Perhaps it\noffers a ‘picture’ or ‘idea’ of some state of\naffairs, and we can identify this content simply by reflecting upon\nthe item itself, and its structural properties. All pragmatists have\nrejected this idea as a key driver of an antinaturalistic Cartesian\ndualism. Instead, they have held that the content of a thought,\njudgment or proposition is a matter of the role it fills in our\nactivities of inquiry, and is to be explained by reference to how we\ninterpret it or what we do with it. This shall be illustrated by\nconsidering three particular pragmatist views. \nFirst, all of the classic pragmatists identified beliefs and other\nmental states as habits. According to Peirce, our beliefs\n‘[g]uide our desires and shape our actions’ (EP1: 114).\nThe content of a belief is determined by its role in determining our\nactions. This was reflected in Peirce’s formulations of his\nPragmatic Maxim. In order to be clear about the content of a concept\nor hypothesis, we must reflect upon its role in determining what we\nshould do in the light of our desires and our background knowledge. In\nRobert Brandom’s terminology, the philosopher ‘makes\nexplicit’ aspects of our practice that are implicit in our\nhabits and dispositions. The role of tacit habits of reasoning and\nacting in fixing our beliefs and guiding our actions is a theme that\nrecurs in the work of the pragmatists, and is now finding strong\nechoes in recent empirically informed work on ‘4E’\ncognition, which is embodied, embedded, enactive and extended. (For an\naccounts of this research area which explicitly engage classical\npragmatism, see Menary 2007 and Gallagher 2017.) \nThe second illustration concerns a passage in which James defended his\naccount of truth by urging that it was the concept used in successful\nscience. He identified the ‘traditional view’ that, for\nearly scientists, the ‘clearness, beauty and\nsimplification’ provided by their theories led them to think\nthat they had deciphered authentically the eternal thoughts of the\nAlmighty. By contrast, contemporary scientists held that ‘no\ntheory is absolutely a transcript of reality, but that any of them may\nfrom some point of view be useful …’. A scientific theory\nwas to be understood as ‘an instrument: it is designed to\nachieve a purpose—to facilitate action or increase\nunderstanding’ (James 1907: 33). For James and Dewey, this holds\nof all our concepts and theories: we treat them as instruments to be\njudged by how well they achieve their intended purpose. \nThe third illustration comes from Peirce’s general theory of\nsigns, or semiotics, which was developed entirely independently\nof the more well-known semiotics of Ferdinand de Saussure, and is one\nof the most original areas of his thought. Peirce’s semiotics\noffers an account of the contents of thoughts as well as language,\nvisual media, music and any other item that can be said to have\nmeaning (for introductions to this area of Peirce’s thought, see\nLiszka 1996; Short 2007). Unlike Saussure, Peirce insisted that the\nsign-relation was essentially triadic in structure,\ncomprising a representation, an object and an interpretation. In other\nwords: a sign is ‘about’ some object because it is\nunderstood, in subsequent thought, as a sign of that object. This\nsubsequent thought Peirce calls the sign’s\ninterpretant. In understanding or interpreting a sign, we may\nfeel things about it (which at times Peirce called the emotional\ninterpretant), undertake actions that are rational in the light of\nthe sign and the other information we possess (the dynamic\ninterpretant), or an indefinite number of inferences may be drawn\nfrom it (the logical interpretant) (Jappy 2016). Interpretation\nis generally a goal-directed activity and, once again, the content of\na sign is determined by the ways in which we use it (or might do\nso). \nA further triadic distinction deriving from Peirce’s theory of\nsigns which has been influential in disciplines from Biology to Media\nStudies holds between three ways in which a sign may pick out its\nobject: \nThese three kinds of signs Peirce termed: icon, index\nand symbol respectively. Meanwhile, the three ways in which a\nsign may give rise to its interpretant were categorised by\nPeirce as: \nPeirce’s sign theory continued to richly evolve and clarify\nitself right to the end of his life (Jappy 2016; Bellucci 2017),\nalbeit by means of some rather forbidding special-purpose technical\nterminology.  \nIt would be wrong to conclude that pragmatism was restricted to the\nUnited States or that the only important pragmatist thinkers were\nPeirce, James and Dewey. As is documented by Thayer, there were\npragmatists in Oxford, in France and, especially, in Italy in the\nearly years of the twentieth century (Thayer 1968, part III, Baldwin\n2003: 88–9). Moreover we can mention several other important\nAmerican pragmatists, for example Josiah Royce. Commonly thought to be\nan idealist opponent of James and a critic of pragmatism, Royce\nincreasingly came to be influenced by Peirce’s work on signs and\non the community of inquirers and was acknowledged as a fellow\npragmatist by Peirce himself. C.I. Lewis, the teacher of Quine and of\nseveral generations of Harvard philosophers developed a philosophy\nthat was a sort of pragmatist Kantianism. Murray Murphey has\nidentified him as ‘the last great pragmatist’ (Murphey\n2005). In books such as Mind and the World Order (1929), he\ndefended a pragmatist conception of the a priori, holding that\nour choices of laws of logic and systems of classification were to be\ndetermined by pragmatic criteria (Lewis 1923, 1929; Murphey 2005:\nchapters four and five). Of comparable importance was George Herbert\nMead, whose contribution to the social sciences has been noted. The\nwork of Frank Ramsey at Cambridge (Ramsey 1926) in the 1920s developed\nPeirce’s views on statistical reasoning and on inquiry in ways\nthat provided fertile research programmes through much of the century,\nfor example in the work of Isaac Levi at Columbia (Levi 2012). As a\nnumber of scholars have documented (Boncompagni 2016; Goodman 2002),\nWittgenstein’s later thought acquired a pragmatist flavour\nthrough his reading of James’s Varieties of Religious\nExperience (1902). \nWhere Peirce and Dewey—and even perhaps James—were engaged\nin working out systematic philosophical visions, Rorty treated\n‘pragmatism’ as a more critical or therapeutic\nphilosophical project. What pragmatists teach us about truth,\nhe tells us, is that there is nothing very systematic or constructive\nto be said about it. In particular, the concept does not capture any\nmetaphysical relation between our beliefs and utterances, on the one\nhand, and reality on the other. We can describe what we do with\nthe word ‘true’: we use it to express our endorsement of\nbeliefs and sentences, and sometimes we might find it useful to\nexpress our fallibility by saying that some of our beliefs may not be\ntrue. (Rorty calls this the ‘cautionary’ use of the term.)\nBut, beyond talking about the rather trivial formal properties of the\nconcept, there is nothing more to be said. He also uses what he\ndescribes as a ‘pragmatist’ principle to show that truth\ncannot be our aim when we inquire. This principle holds that we can\nonly adopt something as an aim when we are able to recognize that it\nhas been achieved. And since we are fallible, we are never in a\nposition to prove that one of our beliefs is actually true—all\nwe can recognize is that it meets standards of acceptance that are\nendorsed, for the time being, in our community (Rorty 1991a: chapter\none; 2000; Hookway 2007). This consequentialist reading of pragmatist\nideas is also reflected in his account of how we can criticize and\nrevise our view of the world. We should be free to propose new\n‘vocabularies’—systems of classification and\ndescription. We do not test these vocabularies by seeing whether they\nenable us to discover truths or by showing that they can be\nread off the nature of reality. Instead, we evaluate them by seeing\nhow they enable us to achieve our current goals, formulate better and\nmore satisfying goals, and generally become better at being human\n(Rorty 1995). \nHilary Putnam has at times denied that he is a pragmatist because he\ndoes not think that a pragmatist account of truth can be sustained.\nIndeed, he shows little sympathy for the pragmatic maxim. However, he\nhas written extensively on James, Peirce, and Dewey—often in\ncollaboration with Ruth Anna Putnam—and has provided insightful\naccounts of what is distinctive about pragmatism, and what can be\nlearned from it (See Putnam 1994a). He has identified four\ncharacteristics of pragmatism: the rejection of skepticism; the\nwillingness to embrace fallibilism; the rejection of sharp dichotomies\nsuch as those between fact and value, thought and experience, mind and\nbody, analytic and synthetic etc; and what he calls ‘the primacy\nof practice’ (1994c). With the turn of the twenty first century,\nhe made ambitious claims for the prospects of a pragmatist\nepistemology. After surveying the apparent failures of the original\nenlightenment project, and attributing them to the fact that\nenlightenment philosophers were unable to overcome the fundamental\ndichotomies mentioned above, he expresses the hope that the future\nmight contain a ‘pragmatist enlightenment’ (Putnam\n2004:89–108). The rich understanding of experience and science\noffered by pragmatists may show us how to find an objective basis for\nthe evaluation and criticism of institutions and practices. He is\nparticularly struck by the suggestion that pragmatist epistemology, by\nemphasizing the communal character of inquiry and the need to take\naccount of the experiences and contributions of other inquirers,\nprovides a basis for a defence of democratic values (1993:\n180–202). This may be related to Rorty’s suggestion that\npragmatists insist upon the priority of democracy over philosophy\n(Rorty 1991b). \nAnother symptom of a pragmatist revival is found in the work of Robert\nBrandom. Brandom’s philosophical interests are rather different\nfrom those of the classical pragmatists, of whom he is quite critical\n(Brandom 2011), and who do not noticeably influence his work. His\nviews owe more to philosophers such as Wilfrid Sellars and Quine, his\nteacher Richard Rorty, and historical readings in thinkers such as\nKant and Hegel. As noted above, his concerns are mostly with semantics\nand the philosophy of language. By contrast to the representationalism\ndeplored by many neopragmatists, he develops a version of\ninferentialist semantics in order to construct accounts of our\nuse of words like ‘true’ and ‘refers to’ which\nare liberated from the idea that the function of thought and language\nis ‘to provide a transcript of reality’. The connection to\npragmatism is that his approach to language is focused upon what we\ndo with our practices of making assertions and challenging or\nevaluating the assertions of others. What constitutes an assertion is\nits normative pragmatics: it is the smallest unit of language\nfor which we can take responsibility within a ‘game of giving\nand asking for reasons’. Logical relations are then explicated\nin terms of the entitlements to make further moves in this\n‘language-game’, which flow from the commitments one has\nassumed through one’s previous assertions (Brandom 1994; Brandom\n2000). Brandom also joins the pragmatists in denying that\ntruth is a substantial metaphysical property that can be\npossessed by some propositions and not by others, and in seeking to\nreconstructing an account of reference which makes a difference in\npractice (his favored strategy is, broadly, explaining\nlanguage-users’ capacity to perform anaphora). In (Brandom 2008)\nhe goes further to discuss how different vocabularies understood\npragmatically might be translated into— or reduced to— one\nanother, thereby constructing an overall account of the relationship\nbetween ‘saying’ and ‘doing’ that he hopes\nwill form a basis for reintegrating analytic and pragmatist\nphilosophy.  \nAnother notable recent foray into pragmatist-inspired normative\npragmatics is found in the work of Jürgen Habermas, a philosopher\nfrom the Frankfurt School who has engaged with unparalleled breadth\nacross the landscape of 20th century philosophy. He manages to combine\nanalytic philosophers’ goal of systematically theorising\nlanguage with a neo-Marxian and hermeneutic critique of modernity,\nwhilst drawing on Mead’s pragmatist analysis of the self as\nirremediably social. His central concept of communicative\naction (Habermas 1981) is advocated as a foil to the\ninstrumentalist rationality that he takes to be rampantly colonising\nthe human ‘lifeworld’ in the West. The discourse ethics\n which he develops in order to scaffold an authentic communicative\naction that is free from the distortions of power and ideology owes\nmuch to pragmatism’s concept of the community of inquiry,\nalthough he is sceptical of Peirce’s inquiry-based analysis of\ntruth as overly idealised (Habermas 2003). With major contributions in\npolitical philosophy, ethics, philosophy of law, aesthetics and\nphilosophy of religion, amongst other areas, Habermas’ influence\nhas reached far into the social sciences – something Dewey would\nlikely have approved.  \nWe have noted that a strong motivation for James’ interest in\npragmatism was exploring truth in religion. He drew on his dual\ntraining in philosophy and psychology for his famous book The\nVarieties of Religious Experience: a unique compendium of\ntestimonies concerning matters such as prayer, worship and mystical\nexperience. These rich personal observations present an extended\nexample of the ‘radical empiricism’ introduced in 4.3.\nJames thereby sought to trenchantly critique the intellectual methods\nof contemporary theology (‘the metaphysical monster which they\noffer to our worship is an absolutely worthless invention of the\nscholarly mind’ (James 1902: 447)). James also advanced a\ncelebrated argument for religious faith in his paper “The Will\nto Believe”: that for questions that are living, forced and\nmomentous (though only for those), ‘faith based on desire is\ncertainly a lawful, and possibly an indispensable thing’. He\nthereby confronted his contemporary William Clifford’s\nevidentialist claim that, ‘It is wrong always, everywhere, and\nfor anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence’\n(1877), generating a lively discussion which continues today (e.g.\nBishop 2007; Aikin 2014).  \nDespite James’ efforts to tightly circumscribe his\nargument’s application, Peirce objected to such concessions in\nepistemology, calling the paper in a letter to James, ‘a very\nexaggerated utterance, such as injures a serious man very much’\n(Misak 2013: 64). Peirce himself evolved from an early positivistic\ndisdain for religious questions to producing his own theistic\narguments in later life. In 1893, he published an essay entitled\n“Evolutionary Love”, which passionately contested the\nsocial Darwinism promulgated by many prominent thinkers in his era,\nmost notably Herbert Spencer (Pearce 2020), which he called ‘The\nGospel of Greed’. Here Peirce urges that amongst the three ways\nthe Universe may unfold: (i) by chance, (ii) deterministically, (iii)\nthrough creative love, the third path is the highest and most likely\nto endure since ‘…growth comes only from love, from I\nwill not say self-sacrifice, but from the ardent impulse to fulfill\nanother’s highest impulse’ (CP 6.289). In his final years\nPeirce produced the remarkable essay “A Neglected Argument for\nthe Reality of God”. Here he argued for God’s\nreality, not existence, to signal an ontological\npriority of intelligible principles over efficient causes. The piece\nis structured into three argumentative layers: (i) The Humble Argument\n(an invitation to a phenomenological experiment) which is enfolded by,\n(ii) The Neglected Argument (an original version of the Ontological\nArgument) which is enfolded by, (iii) The Scientific Argument (a\nprophecy of the fullness of future scientific inquiry). Work is\nongoing to draw out this unique piece’s full meaning.  \nDewey turned his hand to religious questions in his 1934 book A\nCommon Faith. Here he argued that—contrary to what many\nbelieve—removing faith in supernatural entities will not destroy\nreligion, but rather set it free from the many ‘creeds and\ncults’ reflecting outdated social structures that currently\nsurvive fossilised inside religious institutions. Rather than being\nembodied by any kind of entity, he argued, the sacred is a\nphase or quality of experience, namely, ‘some complex of\nconditions that have operated to affect an orientation in\nlife…that brings with it a sense of security and peace’\n(LW9:13). Such conditions might equally be found in a forest or art\ngallery as a church or temple. Despite its sophisticated argumentation\nand originality, as an explication of religious life Dewey’s\napproach has been considered abstract and somewhat anodyne.  \nWe’ve seen that philosophical pragmatism seeks to connect theory\nto practice. In ethics it can seem natural to interpret this as\nrecommending that normative notions be reduced to practical utility.\nThus James embraced utilitarian ethics as one of the branches of\npragmatism (James 1907). Peirce, however, took a different view.\nInitially (around 1898) his naturalism led him to advocate a\nsentimentalism according to which ethical questions should be\nsettled by instinct, as our conscious reasoning is too recently\nevolved and fallible to determine ‘vitally important\nmatters’. But around 1902 he began to warm towards ethical\ntheorising, as he developed a philosophical architectonic which placed\nethics directly prior to logic, since ethics studies what is good in\naction, and logic studies what is good in thought, which is a species\nof action. He noted, though, that such a ‘normative\nscience’ should be understood to study what goodness is,\nnot whether particular actions are good (by contrast to much normative\nethics today) since, ‘a science cannot have for its fundamental\nproblem to distribute objects among categories of its own\ncreation’ (CP 2.198). Recently scholars have turned with renewed\ninterest to developing Peirce’s ethics (e.g. Massecar 2016;\nAtkins 2016).  \nA rich and systematic early contribution to pragmatist value theory\nwas made by Alain Locke, who wrote, ‘the gravest problem of\ncontemporary philosophy is how to ground some normative principle or\ncriterion of objective validity for values without resort to dogmatism\nand absolutism on the intellectual plane, and without falling into\ntheir corollaries, on the plane of social behavior and action, of\nintolerance and mass coercion’ (Locke 1935: 336). Locke taught\nthat the distinctive feeling-qualities that values give rise to in us\nare our ultimate guide in studying them, although function has an\nimportant secondary role to play. He held the resulting axiology to be\npluralist, as well as culturally relativist. \nDewey also sought to steer ethics between the traditional poles of an\nobjectivism derived from some kind of human-transcendent authority,\nand a subjectivism derived from individual preference. He believed\nthat both views err in granting the moral agent an identity prior to\ninteractions with others. For Dewey, we are more frail beings than\nthis, embedded in a sociality that runs much deeper, and the purpose\nof moral theory is ultimately to provide constructive methods for\naddressing human problems of a particular kind: those in which we find\nourselves unable to choose between equally valuable ends, with a\ndearth of salient habits with which to cross the breach. With regard\nto such questions, much effort is required to clear away traditional\nethical theory’s pretensions to deliver a spurious settled\ncertainty. Progress can be made by recognising the inherent\nuncertainty of moral problems and the complexities of moral experience\n(Hildebrand 2008: 73), and being willing to inquire anew in every\nmoral context, drawing in data from a variety of scientific\ndisciplines, in order to lay down new intelligent habits. The\nevolution of Dewey’s ethical thinking across his long career is\nrichly explored in (Welchman 1995).  \nIn recent decades, value theory has arguably been under-addressed by\npragmatists, due to neopragmatism’s strong focus on philosophy\nof language and metaphilosophy. A notable recent attempt to develop a\npragmatist metaethics drawing on classical pragmatism is (Heney 2016),\nwhich forms part of the so-called New Pragmatism.  \nWhen (around 1902) Peirce defined ethics as a normative science\ndirectly prior to logic, he also defined aesthetics as a normative\nscience directly prior to ethics (since aesthetics studies goodness in\nand of itself, which may then be used to understand good action). This\nfocus on the intrinsically good or admirable broadens the purview of\naesthetics, which Peirce claims ‘has been handicapped by the\ndefinition of it as the theory of beauty’ (CP 2.199, 1902).\nAesthetics is one of the least well worked-out areas of Peirce’s\nphilosophy; nevertheless he says some intriguing and suggestive things\nabout it. For instance he argues that the so-called summum\nbonum (ultimate good) really consists in the growth of\n‘concrete reasonableness’ (CP 1.602; 1.615; 2.34; 5.121;\n5.433), as the only phenomenon ‘whose admirableness is not due\nto an ulterior reason’ must be the furthering of Reason itself\n(CP 1.615, 1903). Recent further development of this framework\nincludes (Kaag 2014; Gava 2014).  \nJames did not make sustained contributions to aesthetics, but Dewey\ndid, particularly in his 1934 book Art as Experience. Dewey\nviewed aesthetic appreciation as a peak human experience and\n‘the greatest intellectual achievement in the history of\nhumanity’ (LW10:31, cited in Hildebrand 2008: 146). Consequently\nthe most important question in this area of philosophy is not how to\ndefine necessary and sufficient conditions for Art, but how to enable\nordinary people to enjoy more of it, so that their lives might be more\nmeaningful. The way forward, Dewey suggested, is to learn to fetishize\nprofessionally-curated contexts and Art objects less, in order to open\nour eyes to consummatory experiences as they occur in the everyday\nexperience of the ‘live creature’. Examples of such\nconsummations include: ‘[a] piece of work is finished in a way\nthat is satisfactory; a problem receives its solution; a game is\nplayed through…’ (LW10:42). In contrast to such\nintegrated completions within experience, both hedonistic dissipation\nand rigid self-control count as ‘anesthetic’. True art\nalternates between doing and undergoing. Notable recent work building\non Dewey’s aesthetics includes Richard Shusterman’s\nsomaesthetics, which extends pragmatism’s defining\ninterest in agency to exploring the complex role of the human body in\naesthetic experience (Shusterman 1992; 2012). \nPeirce had some insightful things to say about pedagogy which\nanticipate today’s ‘inquiry-based learning’ and\n‘research-led teaching’, but they are scattered across his\nwritings (Strand 2005). The giant figure in philosophy of education is\nof course Dewey, who pioneered and established it as a separate sphere\nof study when he first assumed the chair in Philosophy at University\nof Chicago in 1894. Dewey’s career coincided with a period in\nwhich North America’s population was rapidly growing,\nindustrializing and urbanizing, shifting education delivery out of the\nhome into public institutions, and his ideas had enormous impact. Many\nof his suggestions derive from his vision of democracy as not merely a\nsystem of voting but the idea that every societal institution might be\ndesigned to foster maximum flourishing in every citizen. Viewed from\nthis angle, traditional modes of schooling whereby teachers deliver an\napproved (often employer-sanctioned) set of facts for children to\nmemorise count as despotic. Instead the emphasis should be on enabling\nchildren to grow from within, according to their present interests and\ncapabilities, and become lifelong learners, although Dewey equally\ncriticises certain romantic, ‘child-centred’ educational\ntheorists of his day for neglecting to direct or guide the\nchild’s interests in any particular direction (Hildebrand 2008:\n127). It’s also worth noting that Dewey sees education as\nprimarily a social not an individual process since, as noted above, he\nviews human identity formation as irremediably social.  \nThe result is a ‘problem-centred pedagogy’ which looks to\npragmatist epistemology understood as the theory of inquiry for its\nstructure. The teacher begins by facilitating contact with some\nphenomenon which proves genuinely puzzling to the students, then\nguides them through a cycle of inquiry which (if all goes well)\nresolves the problematic situation to the satisfaction of all present.\nThis cycle of inquiry includes as stages: articulating the problem and\nquestions which might need to be answered in its resolution, gathering\ndata, suggesting hypotheses which might potentially resolve the\nproblem, and testing or otherwise evaluating those hypotheses. Opening\nup the classroom to such ‘live’ thinking generates\nunpredictability which can be challenging for the teacher to manage,\nbut if the genuine indeterminacy of the problematic situation can be\nsuccessfully navigated, the reward will be students who have learned\nnot just how to know, but how to think. In that regard,\nDewey claimed that his writings on education summed up his entire\nphilosophical position (Hildebrand 2008: 124). For Dewey, all\nphilosophy was philosophy of education.","contact.mail":"c.legg@deakin.edu.au","contact.domain":"deakin.edu.au"}]
