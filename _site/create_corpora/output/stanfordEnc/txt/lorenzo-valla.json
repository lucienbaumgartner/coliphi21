In his Elegantiae linguae Latinae, an advanced\nhandbook of Latin language and style, he gave the humanist program\nsome of its most trenchant and combative formulations, bringing the\nstudy of Latin to an unprecedented level. He made numerous\ncontributions to classical scholarship. But he also used his vast\nknowledge of the classical languages and their literatures as a tool\nto criticize a wide range of ideas, theories, and established\npractices. He famously exposed the Donation of Constantine—an\nimportant document justifying the papacy’s claims to temporal \nrule—as a forgery. He compared, for the first time, St. Jerome’s\ntranslation of the Bible with the Greek text of the New Testament,\nthereby laying the foundations of critical biblical scholarship. In\nhis\nRepastinatio dialectice et philosophie (Re-ploughing of\nDialectic and Philosophy), also known as his Dialectics,\nhe attacked scholastic-Aristotelian thought from an essentially\nlinguistic point of view. Already highly controversial in his own\ntimes, Valla’s works continue to provoke heated debate in modern\ntimes.\n\n\n\nValla did not have an easy life. Equipped with a sharp and polemical\nmind, an even sharper pen and a sense of self-importance verging on\nthe pathological, he made many enemies throughout his life. Born in\nRome in (most likely) 1406 to a family with ties to the papal curia,\nValla as a young man was already in close contact with some major\nhumanists working as papal secretaries such as Leonardo Bruni\n(1370–1444) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459). Another was his uncle\nMelchior Scrivani, whom Valla had hoped to succeed after his death;\nbut opposition from Poggio and Antonio Loschi (1365/8–1441) must have\nled the pope to refuse to employ him. Valla had criticized an elegy by\nLoschi, and had also boldly favored Quintilian over Cicero in a\ntreatise which has long considered to be lost; but a lengthy anonymous\nprefatory letter has recently been found and ascribed, convincingly,\nto the young Valla (Pagliaroli 2008; it turns out not to be a\ncomparison between Cicero’s theory of rhetoric and Quintilian’s\nhandbook, as scholars have always assumed, but a comparison between a\ndeclamation of Ps-Quintilian, Gladiator—the\ndeclamations were considered to be the work of Quintilian in Valla’s\ntime—and one of Cicero’s orations, Pro Ligario.)\nValla’s Roman experience of humanist conversations found an outlet in\nhis dialogue De voluptate (On Pleasure), in which\nthe Christian concepts of charity and beatitude are identified with\nhedonist pleasure, while the “Stoic” concept of virtue is\nrejected (see below). Valla would later revise the dialogue and change\nthe names of the interlocutors, but his Epicurean-Christian position\nremained the same. \n\nMeanwhile he had moved to Pavia in 1431, stimulated by his friend\nPanormita (Antonio Beccadelli, 1394–1471)—with whom he was\nsoon to quarrel—and had begun to teach rhetoric. He had to\nflee Pavia, however, in 1433 after having aroused the anger of the\njurists. In a letter to a humanist jurist friend of his, Catone Sacco\n(1394–1463), Valla had attacked the language of one of the lawyers’\nmain authorities, Bartolus of Sassoferrato (1313–1357). After some\ntravelling, in 1435 Valla found employment at the court of Alfonso of\nAragon (1396–1458), who was trying to capture Naples. Though\ncomplaining about the lack of time, books and fellow humanists, Valla\nwas immensely productive in this phase of his career. In 1439 he\nfinished the first version of his critique of scholastic\nphilosophy. Two years later he finished his\nElegantiae linguae Latinae, a manual for the correct use of\nLatin syntax and vocabulary, which became a bestseller throughout\nEurope. As a humanist in the court of a king who was fighting against\nthe pope, Valla demonstrated that the Donation of Constantine, which\nhad served the papacy to claim worldly power, was a forgery. In the\nsame years he composed a dialogue on free will and began working on his\nannotations to the standard Latin translation of the Bible, comparing\nit with the Greek text of the New Testament. He also wrote a dialogue\nOn the Profession of the Religious (De professione\nreligiosorum), in which he attacked the vow of obedience and\nasceticism taken by members of religious orders. Further, he worked on\nthe text of Livy, wrote a history of the deeds of Alfonso’s\nfather, and began re-reading and annotating Quintilian’s\nInstitutio oratoria (Education of the Orator) in a\nmanuscript which is still extant (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale\nde France, lat. 7723). But Valla’s philological approach and his\npenchant for quarreling made him enemies at the Aragonese court. After\nhis patron Alfonso had made peace with the pope in 1443, Valla’s\nrole as an anti-papal polemicist may have shrunk. His enemies took\nadvantage of the situation. The immediate occasion was Valla’s\ndenial of the apostolic origin of the Symbolum Apostolicum\n(Apostle’s Creed). In a letter, now lost, to the Neapolitan\nlawyers he argued that a passage from Gratian’s Decretum\nthat formed the basis of the belief in the apostolic origin of the\nCreed was corrupt and needed emendation. Powerful men at the court\nstaged an inquisitorial trial to determine whether Valla’s works\ncontained heretical and heterodox opinions. In preparation for the\ntrial Valla wrote a self-defense (and later an “Apology”),\nbut was rescued from this perilous situation by the intervention of the\nking. The whole affair must have fuelled Valla’s wish to return\nto Rome. In 1447 he made peace with the pope and became an apostolic\nscriptor (scribe), and later, in 1455, a papal secretary. In\nthese years he revised some of his earlier works such as the\nRepastinatio and his notes on the New Testament, and\ntranslated Thucydides and Herodotus into Latin; his work on Thucydides,\nin particular, was to have an important impact on the study of this\ndifficult Greek author. Always an irascible man, he continued to engage\nin quarrels and exchanged a series of invectives with his arch-enemy\nPoggio. He died in 1457, still working on a second revision of his\nRepastinatio (that is, the third version). He was buried in\nthe Lateran. \n\nValla’s impact on the humanist movement was long-lasting and\nvaried. His philological approach was developed by subsequent\ngenerations of humanists, and found, arguably, its first systematic\nexpression in the work of Angelo Poliziano\n(1454–1494). His Elegantiae was printed many times, either in\nthe original or in one of its many adaptations and abridgments made by\nlater scholars. A copy of his annotations on the New Testament was\nfound near Louvain by Erasmus (1467?–1534), who published it. Though\nmany theologians complained about his ignorance of theology, Luther\nand Leibniz, each for his own reasons, found occasion to refer to\nValla’s dialogue on free will. Humanists found Valla’s criticisms of\nAristotelian-scholastic thought congenial, though not a few regarded\nhis style as too aggressive and polemical. And though some humanists\nsuch as Juan Luis Vives (1492–1540) and Johann Eck (1486–1543)\ncomplained about Valla’s lack of philosophical acumen, his critique of\nscholasticism has a place in the long transformation from medieval to\nmodern thought—in which humanism played an important though by\nno means exclusive role. \n\nIn his Repastinatio dialectice et philosophie,\nwhich is extant in three versions with slightly different titles,\nValla attacks what he sees as the foundations of\nscholastic-Aristotelian philosophy and sets out to transform\nAristotelian dialectic. As the title of the first version clearly\nindicates, he wants to “re-plough” the ground\ntraditionally covered by the Aristotelian scholastics. The\nterm repastinatio means not only “re-ploughing”\nor “re-tilling” but also “cutting back” and\n“weeding out.” Valla desires to weed out everything he\nregards as barren and infertile in scholastic thought and to\nre-cultivate the ground by sprinkling it with the fertile waters of\nrhetoric and grammar. His use of\nrepastinatio indicates that he is setting out a program of\nreform rather than of destruction, in spite of his often aggressive and\npolemical tone. Book I is devoted mainly to metaphysics, but also\ncontains chapters on natural philosophy and moral philosophy, as well a\ncontroversial chapter on the Trinity. In Books II and III Valla\ndiscusses propositions and forms of argumentation such as the\nsyllogism. \n\nHis main concern in the first book is to simplify the\nAristotelian-scholastic apparatus.  For Valla, the world consists of\nthings, simply called res.  Things have qualities and do or\nundergo things (which he refers to as “things”). Hence,\nthere are three basic categories: substance, quality, and action. At\nthe back of Valla’s mind are the grammatical categories of noun,\nadjective, and verb; but in many places he points out that we cannot\nassume that, for instance, an adjective always refer to a quality or a\nverb to an action (Repastinatio, 134–156; 425–442). These three\ncategories are the only ones Valla admits; the other Aristotelian\ncategories of accidents such as place, time, relation and quantity can\nall be reduced to quality or action.  Here, too, grammar plays a\nleading role in Valla’s thought. From a grammatical point of view,\nqualities such as being a father, being in the classroom, or being\nsix-feet tall all tell us something about how a particular man is\nqualified; and there is, consequently, no need to preserve the other\nAristotelian categories. \n\nIn reducing the categories to his triad of substance, quality, and\naction, Valla does not seem to have in mind “realist”\nphilosophers who accepted the independent existence of entities such\nas relations and quantities over and above individual things. Instead,\nhis aim is to show that many terms traditionally placed in other\ncategories, in fact, point to qualities or actions: linguistic usage\n(loquendi\nconsuetudo) teaches us, for example, that quality is the\noverarching category. Thus, to the question “of what kind”,\nwe often give answers containing quantitative expressions. Take, for\ninstance, the question: what sort of horse should I buy? It may be\nanswered: erect, tall, with a broad chest, and so on. Valla’s\nreduction of the categories often assumes the form of grammatical\nsurveys of certain groups of words associated with a particular\ncategory: thus, in his discussion of time, he studies words like\n“day,” “year,” and a host of others; and his\ndiscussion of quantitative words treats mathematical terms such as\nline, point and circle. Of course, Valla does not deny that we can\nspeak of quantity or time or place. But the rich array of Latin terms\nsignify, in the final analysis, the qualities or actions of things, and\nnothing exists apart from concrete things. (Substance is a shady\ncategory for Valla, who says that he cannot give an example of it, much\nas Locke was later to maintain that “a substance is something I\nknow not what”). \n\nIt is tempting to connect this lean ontology to that of William of\nOckham (c. 1287–1347).  The interests, approach and arguments of the\ntwo thinkers, however, differ considerably. Unlike Valla, Ockham does\nnot want to get rid of the system of categories. As long as one\nrealizes, Ockham says, that categories do not describe things in the\nworld but categorize\nterms by which we signify real substances or real inhering\nqualities in different ways, the categories can be maintained and the\nspecific features of, for example, relational or quantitative terms can\nbe explored. Thus, Ockham’s rejection of a realist interpretation\nof the categories is accompanied by a wish to defend the\ncategories as distinct groups of terms. Valla, on the other hand, sees\nthe categories as summing up the real aspects of things: hence, there\nare only substances, qualities, and actions, and his reductive program\nconsists in showing that we have a vast and rich vocabulary in Latin\nthat we can use for referring to these things. His questions about\nwords and classes of words are not unlike those of Priscian (fl.\n500–530) and other grammarians. (Priscian, for instance, had stated\nthat a noun signifies substance plus quality, and pronouns substance\nwithout quality.) \n\nAnother good example of Valla’s reduction of scholastic terminology,\ndistinctions, and concepts is his critique of the transcendental\nterms.  According to Valla, the traditional six terms—“being,” \n“thing,” “something,”\n“one,” “true,” and “good”—should \nbe reduced to “thing” (Latin res) since\neverything that exists, including a quality or an action of a thing\n(also called a “thing”) is a thing. A good thing, for\nexample, is a thing, and so, too, is a true thing. Valla’s grammatical\napproach is evident in his rejection of the scholastic\nterm ens. Just as “running” (currens)\ncan be resolved into “he who runs” (is qui\ncurrit), so “being” (ens) can be resolved\ninto “that which is” (id quod est).\n“That,” however, is nothing other than “that\nthing” (ea res); so we get as a result the\nlaborious formula: “that thing which is”. We do not,\nhowever, need the phrase “that which is” (ea que\nest): “a stone is a being” (lapis est ens),\nor the equivalent phrase into which it can be resolved, “a stone\nis a thing which is” (lapis est res que est), are\nunclear, awkward, and absurd ways of saying simply that “a stone\nis a thing” (lapis est res). Valla also rejects other\nscholastic terms such as entitas\n(“entity”), hecceitas (“this-ness”)\nand quidditas (“quidity”) for grammatical\nreasons: these terms do not conform to the rules of word formation in\nLatin.  While he is not against the introduction of new words for\nthings unknown in antiquity (e.g., bombarda for\n“cannonball”), the terminology coined by the scholastics\nis a different matter entirely. \n\nRelated to this analysis is Valla’s repudiation of what he presents as\nthe scholastic view of the distinction between abstract and concrete\nterms, that is, the view that abstract terms (“whiteness,”\n“fatherhood”) always refer solely to quality, while\nconcrete terms (“white,” “father”) refer to\nboth substance and quality (Repastinatio, 21–30). In a careful\ndiscussion of this distinction, taking into account the grammatical\ncategories of case, number, and gender, Valla rejects the ontological\ncommitments which such a view seems to imply, and shows, on the basis\nof a host of examples drawn from classical Latin usage, that abstract\nterms often have the same meaning as their concrete counterparts\n(useful/utility, true/truth, honest/honesty). These terms refer to the\nconcrete thing itself, that is, to the substance, its quality or\naction (or a combination of these three components into which a thing\ncan be resolved). Again, Valla’s main concern is to study the workings\nof language and how these relate to the world of everyday things, the\nworld that we see and experience. \n\nIn describing and analyzing this world of things Valla is not only\nguided by grammatical considerations. He also uses “common\nsense” and the limits of our imagination as yardsticks against\nwhich to measure scholastic notions and definitions. He thus thinks\nthat it is ridiculous to imagine prime matter without any form or form\nwithout any matter, or to define a line as that which has no width and\na point as an indivisible quantity that occupies no\nspace. Valla’s idea is that notions such as divisibility and\nquantity are properly at home only in the world of ordinary\nthings. For him, there is only the world of bodies with actual shapes\nand dimensions; lines and points are parts of these things, but only,\nas he seems to suggest, in a derivative sense, in other words, as\nplaces or spaces that are filled by the body or parts of that body. If\nwe want to measure or sketch a (part of a) body, we can select two\nspots on it and measure the length between them by drawing points and\nlines on paper or in our mind, a process through which these points\nand lines become visible and divisible parts of our world\n(Repastinatio, 142–147; 427–431). But it would be\nwrong to abstract from this diagramming function and infer a world of\npoints and lines with their own particular quantity. They are merely\naids for measuring or outlining bodies. In modern parlance, Valla\nseems to be saying that ontological questions about these\nentities—do they exist? how do they exist?—amount to\ncategory mistakes, equivalent to asking the color of virtue. \n\nThe appeal to common sense (or what Valla considers as such) informs\nhis critique of Aristotelian natural philosophy. He insists on\ncommonplace observations and experiences as criteria for testing ideas\nand hypotheses. On this basis, many of Aristotle’s contentions, so\nValla argues, are not true to the facts (Repastinatio, 98–112). He\nrejects or qualifies a number of fundamental tenets of Aristotelian\nphysics, for instance that movement is the cause of heat, that a\nmovement is always caused by another movement, that elements can be\ntransformed into one another, that each has its own proper qualities\n(heat and dryness for fire, heat and humidity for air, etc.), that\nthere are pure elements, that the combination of heat and humidity is\na sufficient condition for the generation of life, and so forth. Valla\noften uses reductio ad absurdum as an argumentative strategy:\nif Aristotle’s theory is true, one would expect to observe phenomena\nquite different from the ones we do, in fact, observe. In arguing, for\ninstance, for the existence of a fiery sphere below the moon,\nAristotle had claimed that “leaden missiles shot out by force\nmelt in the air” (De caelo II.7, 289a26–28). Valla\nrejects this claim by appealing to ordinary experience: we never see\nballs—whether leaden, iron, or stone, shot out of a sling or a\ncannon—heat up in the air; nor do the feathers of arrows catch\nfire. If movement is sufficient to produce heat, the spheres would set\nthe air beneath in motion; but no one has ever observed\nthis. Arguably, the importance of Valla’s polemic here is not so much\nthe quality of his arguments as the critical tendency they reveal, the\nawareness that Aristotle’s conclusions often do not conform to daily\nexperience. While he does not develop his critique in the direction of\nan alternative natural philosophy as later Renaissance philosophers\nsuch as Bernardino Telesio (1509–1588) and Francesco Patrizi of Cherso\n(1529–1597) would do, Valla contributed to undermining faith in the\nexclusive validity of the Aristotelian paradigm. \n\nValla also criticizes Aristotle’s natural philosophy because,\naccording to him, it detracts from God’s power. In strongly polemical\nterms, he attacks Aristotle for his “polytheistic” ideas\nand for what Valla sees as his equation of God with nature\n(Repastinatio, 54–59).  Valla wants to reinstate God as\nthe sole creator of heaven and earth.  To think of the cosmos in terms\nof a living animal or the heavens in terms of celestial orbs moved by\nintelligences is anathema to Valla (as it was to many medieval\nscholastics as well). The notion of God as First Mover is also\nrejected, since movement and rest are terms which should not be\napplied (except perhaps metaphorically) to spiritual beings such as\nGod, angels, and souls. \n\nReligious considerations also led Valla to find fault with another\nfundamental tenet of Aristotelian scholastic thought: the Tree of\nPorphyry (Repastinatio, 46–50; 389–391). Valla has several problems with\nthe Tree. First of all, it puts substance, rather than thing, on\ntop. For Valla, however, pure substance does not exist, since a thing\nis always already a qualified substance. He also thinks that there is\nno place for a human being in the Tree of Porphyry. Since the Tree\ndivides substance into the corporeal and the spiritual, it is\ndifficult to find a place for a human being, consisting of both soul\nand body. Moreover, the Tree covers both the divine and the created\norder, which leads to inappropriate descriptions of God and angels, to\nwhich the term “animal” should not be applied, since they\ndo not have a body. Valla, therefore, divides Porphyry’s Tree into\nthree different trees: one for spiritual substance, one for corporeal\nsubstance, and one for what he calls “animal,” that is,\nthose creatures which consist of both body and soul (Repastinatio,\n49–50; 422–424). One might argue that what Valla gains over Porphyry\nby disentangling the supernatural from the natural order, he loses by\nhaving to admit that he cannot place Christ in any of his three trees,\nsince he is not only human but also God. \n\nThe soul as an incorporeal substance is treated by Valla in a separate\nchapter (Repastinatio, 59–73; 408–410; 418–419). Rejecting the\nAristotelian hylomorphic account, he returns to an Augustinian picture\nof the soul as a wholly spiritual and immaterial substance made in the\nimage of God, and consisting of memory, intellect, and will. He\nrejects without much discussion the various functions of the soul\n(vegetative, sensitive, imaginative, intellectual), which would\nentail, he thinks, a plurality of souls. He briefly treats the five\nexterior senses but is not inclined to deal with the physiological\naspects of sensation. The term “species” (whether sensible\nor intelligible) does not occur at all. The Aristotelian sensus\ncommunis—which the medieval commentary tradition\non De anima had viewed as one of the internal\nsenses, alongside imagination (sometimes distinguished\nfrom phantasia), memory, and the vis aestimativa\n(foresight and prudence)—is mentioned only to be rejected\nwithout further argument (Repastinatio, 73). Imagination and the vis\naestimativa are absent from Valla’s account, while memory, as the\nsoul’s principal capacity, appears to have absorbed all the functions\nwhich scholastics had divided among separate faculties of the\nsensitive soul. What may have provoked Valla’s anger about the\ntraditional picture is the seemingly passive role allotted to the soul\nin perception and knowledge: it seems to come only at the very end of\na long chain of transmission, which starts with outer objects and\nconcludes with a merely receptive tabula rasa. In his view,\nthe soul is far more noble than the hylomorphic account of Aristotle\nimplies, at least as Valla understands that account. He therefore\nstresses on various occasions the soul’s dignified nature, its\nimmortality, unity, autonomy, and superiority to both the body and the\nanimal soul, comparing it to the sun’s central place in the\ncosmos. \n\nAfter Valla’s attack on what he calls the fundamenta\n(foundations) of Aristotelian-scholastic metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy, he turns to dialectic in Books II and III of his\nRepastinatio. For Valla, argumentation should be approached\nfrom an oratorical rather than a logical point of view. What counts is\nwhether an argument works, which means whether it convinces\none’s adversary or public. The form of the argument is less\nimportant. Dialectic is a species of confirmation and refutation; and,\nas such, it is merely a component of invention, one of the five parts\nof rhetoric (Repastinatio, 175; 447). Compared to rhetoric,\ndialectic is an easy subject and does not require much time to master,\nsince it considers and uses only the syllogism “bare”, as\nValla puts it, that is, in isolation from its wider argumentative\ncontext (Repastinatio, 175); its sole aim is to teach. The\nrhetorician, on the other hand, uses not only the syllogism, but also\nthe enthymeme (incomplete syllogism), epicheireme (a kind of extended\nreasoning) and example. The orator has to clothe everything in\npersuasive arguments, since his task is not only to teach but also to\nplease and to move. This leads Valla to downplay the importance of the\nAristotelian syllogism and to consider forms of argumentation that are\nnot easily forced into its straightjacket. Among these are captious\nforms of reasoning such as the dilemma, paradox, and heap argument\n(sorites), and Valla offers a highly interesting analysis of\nthese forms in the last book of the Repastinatio. \n\nWithout rejecting the syllogism tout court, Valla is scathing\nabout its usefulness. He regards it as an artificial type of\nreasoning, unfit to be employed by orators since it is does not\nreflect the natural way of speaking and arguing. What is the use, for\nexample, of concluding that Socrates is an animal if one has already\nstated that every man is an animal and that Socrates is a man? It is a\nsimple, puerile, and pedantic affair, hardly amounting to a\nreal ars (art).  Valla’s treatment of the syllogism clearly\nshows his oratorical perspective. Following Quintilian, he stresses\nthat the nature of syllogistic reasoning is to establish proof. One of\nthe two premises contains what is to be proven (que\nprobatur), and the other offers the proof (que probat),\nwhile the conclusion gives the result of the proof—into which\nthe proof “goes down” (in quam probatio\ndescendit). It is not always necessary, therefore, to have a\nfixed order (major, minor, conclusion).  If it suits the occasion\nbetter, we can just as well begin with the minor, or even with the\nconclusion. The order is merely a matter of convention and custom\n(Repastinatio, 282–286; 531–534). \n\nThese complaints about the artificiality of the syllogism inform\nValla’s discussion of the three figures of the syllogism. Aristotle\nhad proven the validity of the moods of Figure 2 and 3 by converting\nthem to four moods of Figure 1; and this was taught, for example, by\nPeter of Spain (thirteenth century) in his widely read handbook on\nlogic, the\nSummulae logicales, certainly consulted by Valla here. Valla\nregards this whole business of converting terms and transposing\npropositions in order to reduce a particular syllogism to one of these\nfour moods of Figure 1 as useless and absurd. While he does not\nquestion the validity of these four moods, he believes that there are\nmany deviant syllogisms that are also valid, for instance: God is in\nevery place; Tartarus is a place; therefore, God is in Tartarus. Here\nthe “every” or “all” sign is added to the\npredicate in the major proposition. He says, moreover, that an entirely\nsingular syllogism can be valid: Homer is the greatest of poets; this\nman is the greatest of poets; therefore, this man is Homer. And he\ngives many other examples of such deviant schemes. Valla thus\ndeliberately ignores the criteria employed by Aristotle and his\ncommentators—that at least one premise must be universal, and\nat least one premise must be affirmative, and that if the conclusion is\nto be negative, one premise must be negative—or, at any rate,\nhe thinks that they unnecessarily restrict the number of possible valid\nfigures. \n\nIn his discussion of the syllogism Valla does not refer to an\nimportant principle employed by Aristotle and his\ncommentators: dici de omni et nullo (to be said/predicated\nabout all and about none). To quote Peter of Spain’s Summulae\nlogicales: “To be said of every [dici de\nomni] is when there is nothing to to be taken under the subject\n[nichil est sumere sub subiecto] of which the predicate may\nnot be said, like ‘every man runs’: here, running is said\nof every man, and under man there is nothing to to be taken of which\nrunning is not said. To be said of none [de nullo]\nis when there is nothing to be taken under the subject from which the\npredicate may not be eliminated, like ‘no man runs’: here,\nrunning is eliminated from any man at all [quolibet\nhomine].” (Ed. L. M. de Rijk, Assen 1972, 43). As G. Leff\nparaphrases Ockham: “it denotes that in a universal affirmation\nthe predicate can stand for everything for which the subject can\nstand, and conversely for the dictum de nullo.”\n(Leff, William of Ockham, Manchester 1975, 270 referring to\nE. Moody, The Logic of William of Ockham, London 1935,\n214–215; cf. M. McCord Adams, William of Ockham, 2 vols.,\nNotre Dame 1987, vol. I, 441.) This principle led Aristotle to\nconclude that only four moods of the first figure were immediately\nvalid. That Valla does not make use of this fundamental condition is\nunderstandable from his oratorical point of view, since it would be an\nuninteresting or even irrelevant criterion of validity. It is\ntherefore not surprising that he thinks that we might as well\n“reduce” the first figure to the second rather than vice\nversa. Likewise, from his oratorical point of view, he can only treat\nthe third figure of the syllogism with contempt: it is a\n“completely foolish” form of reasoning; no one reasons as\nfollows: every man is a substance; every man is an animal; therefore,\nsome animal is a substance. In a similar vein, he rejects the use of\nletters in the study of syllogisms (Repastinatio, 297–300; 546–548). \n\nValla’s insistence on examining and assessing arguments in terms of\npersuasion and usefulness leads him to criticize not only the\nsyllogism but also other less formal modes of argumentation. These\nmodes usually involve interrogation, resulting in an unexpected or\nunwanted conclusion or an aporetic situation. Some scholars have\nregarded Valla’s interest in these less formal or non-formal arguments\nas an expression of a skeptical attitude towards the possibility of\ncertainty in knowledge in general. Others have raised serious doubts\nabout this interpretation.  What we can say for sure, however, is that\nValla was one of the first to study and analyze the heap argument,\ndilemma, and suchlike. The heap argument is supposed to induce doubts\nabout the possibility of determining precise limits, especially to\nquantities. If I subtract one grain from a heap, is it still a heap?\nOf course. What if I subtract two grains? And so forth, until the heap\nconsists of just one grain, which, to be sure, is an unacceptable\nconclusion. It seems impossible to determine the exact moment when the\nheap ceases to be a heap, and any attempt to determine this moment\nseems to involve an ad hoc decision, for a heap does not cease to be a\nheap due to the subtraction of just one single grain. Valla discusses\na number of similar cases, and comments on their fallacious\nnature. \n\nDilemma, too, receives extensive treatment from him. This type of\nargument had been widely studied in antiquity. The basic structure is\na disjunction of propositions, usually in the form of a double\nquestion in an interrogation, which sets a trap for the respondent,\nsince whichever horn of the dilemma he chooses, he seems to be caught\nup in a contradiction and will lose the debate (“If he is\nmodest, why should you accuse someone who is a good man? If he is bad,\nwhy should you accuse someone who is unconcerned by such a\ncharge?”, Cicero,\nDe inventione 1.45.83, cited by Valla Repastinatio, 321). It was also\nrecognized that the respondent could often counter the dilemma by\nduplicating the original argument and “turning it back”\n(convertere) on the interrogator, using it as a kind of\nboomerang (“if he is modest, you should accuse him because he\nwill be concerned by such a charge; if he is bad, you should also\naccuse him because he is not a good man”). Alternatively, he\ncould escape the dilemma by questioning the disjunction and showing\nthat there is a third possibility. There were many variations of this\nsimple scheme, and it was studied from a logical as well as a\nrhetorical point of view with considerable overlap between these two\nperspectives. \n\nIn medieval times, dilemma does not seem to have attracted much\ntheoretical reflection, though there was an extensive literature on\nrelated genres such as\ninsolubilia and paradoxes, which were generally treated in a\nlogical manner. It is, therefore, interesting to see Valla discussing a\nwhole range of examples of dilemma. The rhetoric textbook by the\nByzantine émigré George of Trebizond (1396–1486),\ncomposed about 1433, was probably an important source for him. This\nwork might also have led Valla to explore the relevant places in\nQuintilian, Cicero, the Greek text of Aristotle’s\nRhetoric and perhaps other Greek sources. The example Valla\ndiscusses most extensively comes from Aulus Gellius and concerns a\nlawsuit between Protagoras and his pupil Euathlus (Repastinatio, 312–319;\n562–568. Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 5.10.5–16). The pupil\nhas promised to pay the second installment of the fees as soon as he\nhas won his first case. He refuses to pay, however, and Protagoras\ntakes him to court. If Euathlus loses the case, he will have to pay the\nrest of the fee, on account of the verdict of the judges; but if\nEuathlus wins, he will also have to pay, this time on account of his\nagreement with Protagoras. Euathlus, however, cleverly converts the\nargument: in neither case will he have to pay, on account of the\ncourt’s decision (if he wins), or on account of the agreement\nwith Protagoras (if he loses). Aulus Gellius thinks that the judges\nshould have refrained from passing judgment because any decision would\nbe inconsistent with itself. But Valla rejects such a rebuttal\n(antistrephon or conversio) of the dilemma and thinks\nthat a response may be formulated as long as one concentrates on the\nrelevant aspects of the case. Briefly put, Valla says that Euathlus\ncannot have it both ways and must choose one or the other alternative:\nhe must comply either with his agreement with Protagoras or with the\nverdict passed by the judges. If they decide against Protagoras, he may\ntry to reclaim his money in a second lawsuit. At any rate, there is no\nreason to despair; Aulus Gellius is, therefore, wrong in thinking that\nthe judges should have refrained from passing a judgment. In all such\ncases, Valla argues, the conversion is not a rebuttal, but at best a\ncorrection of the initial argument (a correction, however, is not a\nrefutation), and at worst a simple repetition or illegitimate shift of\nthe initial position. \n\nAn important way of seeing through deceptive arguments is to consider\nthe weight of words carefully, and Valla gives some further examples\nof fallacies which can easily be refuted by examining the meaning and\nusage of words and the contexts in which they occur (Repastinatio,\n320–334; 568–578). He considers the fallacies “collected by\nAristotle in his\nSophistical Refutations as for the most part a puerile\nart,” quoting the Rhetorica ad Herennium (2.11.16) to\nthe effect that “knowledge of ambiguities as taught by\ndialecticians is of no help at all but rather a most serious\nhindrance.” Valla is not interested in providing a comprehensive\nlist of deceptive arguments and errors or in studying rules for\nresolving them. He does not mention, for example, the basic division\nbetween linguistic (in dictione) and extra-linguistic\n(extra dictionem) fallacies. In a letter to a friend, Valla\nlists some “dialecticians”—Albert of Saxony (c.\n1316–1390), Albert the Great (c. 1220–1280), Ralph Strode (fl.\n1350–1400), William of Ockham, and Paul of Venice (c. 1369–1429)\n—but there is no sign that he had done more than leaf through\ntheir works on sophismata and insolubilia (Valla\n1984, 201). The few examples he gives seem to come from Peter of\nSpain’s Summulae logicales. Nor was it necessary to have\nmore than a superficial acquaintance with the works of these\ndialecticians in order to realize that their approach differed vastly\nfrom his. As he repeatedly states, what is required in order to\ndisambiguate fallacies is not a deeper knowledge of the rules of logic\nbut a recognition that arguments need to be evaluated within their\nwider linguistic and argumentative context. Such an examination of how\nwords and arguments function will easily lay bare the artificial and\nsophistical nature of these forms of argumentation. \n\nThis approach is also evident in Valla’s analysis of the proposition\nof which a syllogism or argument consists. Propositions are\ntraditionally divided according to quantity (universal of particular)\nand to quality (affirmative and negative). Quantity and quality are\nindicated by words that are called signa (markers, signs):\n“all,” “any,” “not,” “no\none,” and so forth. In Book II of the Repastinatio,\nValla considers a much wider range of words than the medieval\nlogicians, who had mainly worked with “all,”\n“some,” “none,” and “no one”. To\nsome extent, his aim is not unlike that of the dialecticians whom he\nso frequently attacks, that is, to study signs of quality and negation\nand how they determine the scope of a proposition.  But for him there\nis only one proper method of carrying out such a study: examining\ncarefully the multifarious ways in which these words are used in\nrefined and grammatically correct Latin. Not surprisingly, Valla\ncriticizes the square of contraries—the fourfold\nclassification of statements in which the distinction between\nuniversal and particular and that between affirmative and negative are\ncombined.  A similar critique of the rather arbitrary restriction to a\nlimited set of words is applied to the scholastic notion of modality\n(Valla Repastinatio, 237–244; 491–497). Scholastics usually treat only the following six terms as modals: “possible,”\n“impossible,” “true,” “false,”\n“necessary,” and “contingent.” Latin, however,\nis much more resourceful in expressing modality. Using criteria such\nas refinement and utility, Valla considers terms such as\n“likely/unlikely,” “difficult/easy,”\n“certain/uncertain,” “useful/useless,”\n“becoming/unbecoming,” and\n“honorable/dishonorable.” This amounts to introducing a\nwholly new concept of modality, which comes close to an adverbial\nqualification of a given action. \n\nValla’s principal bêtes noires are Aristotle, Boethius,\nPorphyry, and Peter of Spain, but he also speaks in general terms of\nthe entire natio peripatetica (nation of Peripatetics). He\nfrequently refers to isti (those), a suitably vague label for\nthe scholastic followers of Aristotle—including both\ndialecticians and theologians. It has often been claimed that Valla is\nattacking late medieval scholasticism; but it must be said that he\ndoes not quote any late medieval scholastic philosophers or\ntheologians. He generally steers clear of their questions, arguments,\nand terminology.  If we compare Valla’s Repastinatio with,\nfor example, Paul of Venice’s Logica parva (The\nSmall Logic), we quickly perceive the immense difference in\nattitude, argument, and approach. Moreover, as noted above, Valla’s\ngrammatical and oratorical approach is fundamentally different from\nOckham’s terminism. He probably thought that he did not need to engage\nwith the technical details of scholastic works. It was sufficient for\nhim to establish that there was a huge distance between his own\napproach and that of the scholastics. Once he had shown that the\nscholastic-Aristotelian edifice was built on shaky foundations, he did\nnot care to attack the superstructure, so to speak. And Valla proved\nto his own satisfaction that these foundations were shaky by showing\nthat the terminology and vocabulary of the scholastics rested on a\nmisunderstanding of Latin and of the workings of language in\ngeneral. But even though his criticisms are mainly addressed to\nAristotle, Boethius, and Porphyry, his more general opinion of\nAristotelianism was, of course, formed by what he saw in his own time.\nHe loathed the philosophical establishment at the universities, their\nmethods, genres, and, above all, their style and terminology. He\nthought that they were slavishly following Aristotle. In his view,\nhowever, a true philosopher does not hesitate to re-assess any opinion\nfrom whatever source; refusing to align himself with a sect or school,\nhe presents himself as a critical, independent thinker (Repastinatio,\n1–8; 359–363). Whether scholasticism had, indeed, ossified by the time\nValla came on the scene is a matter of debate; but there is no\nquestion that this is how he and the other humanists saw it. \n\nThe same critical spirit also infuses Valla’s work on moral\nphilosophy. In his dialogue, published as De voluptate in\n1431, when he was still in his mid-twenties, and revised two years\nlater under the title De vero bono (On the True\nGood), Valla presents a discussion between an\n“Epicurean,” a “Stoic,” and a\n“Christian” on an age-old question: what is the highest\nethical good? The result of this confrontation between pagan and\nChristian moral thought is a combination of Pauline fideism and\nEpicurean hedonism, in which the Christian concepts of charity and\nbeatitude are identified with hedonist pleasure, and the\n“Stoic” concept of virtue is rejected (Valla, De vero falsoque bono).\nValla thus treats Epicureanism as a stepping-stone to the development\nof a Christian morality based on the concept of pleasure, and\nrepudiates the traditional synthesis of Stoicism and Christianity,\npopular among scholastics and humanists alike. The substance of the\ndialogue is repeated in a long chapter in his Repastinatio\n(Repastinatio, 73–98; 411–418). \n\nValla’s strategy is to reduce the traditional four virtues—\nprudence, justice, fortitude, and propriety (or temperance)—to\nfortitude, and then to equate fortitude with charity and love. For\nValla, fortitude is the essential virtue, since it shows that we do\nnot allow ourselves to be conquered by the wrong emotions, but instead\nto act for the good. As a true virtue of action, it is closely\nconnected to justice and is defined as “a certain resistance\nagainst both the harsh and the pleasant things which prudence has\ndeclared to be evils.” It is the power to tolerate and suffer\nadversity and bad luck, but also to resist the blandishments of a\nfortune which can be all too good, thus weakening the\nspirit. Fortitude is the only true virtue, because virtue resides in\nthe will, since our actions, to which we assign moral qualifications,\nproceed from the will. \n\nValla’s reductive strategy has a clear aim: to equate this essential\nvirtue of action, fortitude, with the biblical concept of love and\ncharity. This step requires some hermeneutic manipulation, but the\nStoic overtones of Cicero’s account in De officiis have\nprepared the way for it—ironically, perhaps, in view of\nValla’s professed hostility towards Stoicism—since enduring\nhardship with Stoic patience is easily linked to the Pauline message\nthat we become strong by being tested (II Cor. 12:10, quoted by\nValla). The labor, sweat, and trouble we must bear, though bad in\nthemselves, “are called good because they lead to that\nvictory,” Valla writes, echoing St Paul (Repastinatio, 88–89;\n415). We do not, then, strive to attain virtue for its own sake, since\nit is full of toil and hardship, but rather because it leads us to our\ngoal. This is one of Valla’s major claims against the Stoics and the\nPeripatetics, who—at least in Valla’s interpretation—\nregarded virtue as the end of life, that is, the goal which is sought\nfor its own sake. Because virtuous behavior is difficult, requiring us\nto put up with harsh and bitter afflictions, no one naturally and\nvoluntarily seeks virtue as an end in itself. What we seek is pleasure\nor delectation, both in this life and—far more importantly\n—in the life to come. \n\nBy equating pleasure with love, Valla can argue that it is love or\npleasure that is our ultimate end. This entails the striking notion\nthat God is not loved for his own sake, but for the sake of love:\n“For nothing is loved for its own sake or for the sake of\nsomething else as another end, but the love itself is the end”\n(Repastinatio, 417). This is a daring move. Traditionally, God was said\nto be loved for his own sake, not for his usefulness in gaining\nsomething else. Many thinkers agreed with Augustine that concupiscent\nlove was to be distinguished from friendship, and, with respect to\nheavenly beatitude, use from fruition.  We can love something as a\nmeans to an end (use), and we can love something for its own sake\n(fruition). But because Valla has maintained that pleasure is our\nhighest good, God can only be loved as a means to that end. \n\nIt is therefore a moot point whether Valla successfully integrated\nEpicurean hedonism with Christian morality. He seems to argue that the\nEpicurean position is valid only for the period before the coming of\nChrist. In his unredeemed state, man is rightly regarded as a\npleasure-seeking animal, who is governed by self-interest and\nutilitarian motives. After Christ’s coming, however, we have a\ndifferent picture: repudiating Epicurean pleasure, we should choose\nthe harsh and difficult life of Christian honestas (virtue)\nas a step towards heavenly beatitude. Yet, the two views of man are\nnot so readily combined. On the one hand, there is the positive\nevaluation of pleasure as the fundamental principle in human\npsychology—which is confirmed and underscored by the\nterminological equation of\nvoluptas (pleasure), beatitudo (beatitude),\nfruitio (fruition), delectatio (delectation), and\namor (love). On the other hand, Valla states apodictically\nthat there are two pleasures: an earthly one, which is the mother of\nvice, and a heavenly one, which is the mother of virtue; that we should\nabstain from the former if we want to enjoy the latter; and that the\nnatural, pre-Christian life is “empty and worthy of\npunishment” if not put in the wider perspective of human destiny.\nIn other words, we are commanded to live the arduous and difficult life\nof Christian honestas, ruled by restraint, self-denial, and\npropriety (temperance), and, at the same time, to live a hedonist life,\nwhich consists of the joyful, free, and natural gratification of the\nsenses. \n\nAnother of his targets is the Aristotelian account of virtue as a mean\nbetween two extremes. According to Valla, each individual vice is\ninstead the opposite of an individual virtue. He makes this point by\ndistinguishing between two different senses of the same virtue,\nshowing that they have different opposites. So, while Aristotle\nregards fortitude as the mean between the vices of rashness and\ncowardice, Valla argues that there are two aspects to fortitude:\nfighting bravely and being cautious (for instance, in yielding to the\nvictorious enemy), with cowardice and rashness as their respective\nopposites. Likewise, generosity is not the mean between avarice and\nprodigality, but has two aspects: giving and not giving. Prodigality\nis the opposite of the first aspect, avarice of the second, for which\nwe should use the term frugality or thrift rather than\ngenerosity. More generally, the terminology of vices as defects and\nexcesses and virtue as a mean is misleading; virtues and vices should\nnot be ranked “according to whether they are at the bottom, or\nhalfway up, or at the top.” Interestingly, a similar critique of\nAristotle’s notion of virtue as a mean between two extremes has been\nraised in modern scholarship (for example, by W. D.  Ross). \n\nValla regards the Aristotelian notion of virtue as too static and\ninflexible, so that it does not do justice to the impulsive nature of\nour moral behavior. For him, virtue is not a habit, as Aristotle\nbelieved, but rather an affect, an emotion or feeling that can be\nacquired and lost in a moment’s time. Virtue is the domain solely of\nthe will. The greatest virtue or the worse vice may arise out of one\nsingle act. And because virtue is painful and vice tempting, one may\neasily slide from the one into the other, unlike knowledge, which does\nnot turn into ignorance all of a sudden. Valla therefore frequently\nremoves the notions of knowledge, truth, and prudence from the sphere\nof moral action. Virtues as affects are located in the rear part of\nthe soul, the will, while the domains of knowledge, truth, and opinion\nreside in the other two faculties, memory and reason (Repastinatio,\n73–74). This is not to say that the will is independent from the\nintellectual capacities. The affects need reason as their guide, and\nthe lack of such guidance can result in vice. But Valla is not\nentirely clear as to what element we should assign the moral\nqualification “good” or “bad.” He identifies\nvirtues with affects, and says that only these merit praise and blame\n(Repastinatio, 74); however, he also writes that the virtues, as\naffects, cannot be called good or bad in themselves, but that these\njudgments apply only to the will, that is, to the will’s choice. This\nis underlined by his remark that virtue resides in the will rather\nthan in an action (Repastinatio, 77). In his discussion of the soul,\nhowever, he frequently calls reason the will’s guide (e.g., Valla\nRepastinatio, 75), and also says that the affects should follow reason, so\nthat it, too, may be held responsible, in the final analysis, for\nmoral behavior (even though he also explicitly denies that the will is\ndetermined by reason). Finally, pleasure, delectation, or beatitude\nare also called virtue by the equation of virtue with love and with\ncharity (Repastinatio, 85). \n\nMoreover, Valla’s insistence on the will as the locus of moral\nbehavior seems compromised by the predestinarianism advocated by the\ninterlocutor “Lorenzo” in his dialogue De libero\narbitrio (On Free Will). In this highly rhetorical work,\nValla—if we can assume that Lorenzo represents Valla’s own\nposition—stresses that in his inscrutable wisdom God hardens\nthe hearts of some, while saving those of others. We do not know why,\nand it is presumptuous and vain to inquire into the matter.  Yet,\nsomehow we do have free will, “Now, indeed, He brings no\nnecessity, and His hardening one and showing another mercy does not\ndeprive us of free will, since He does this most wisely and in full\nholiness” (Valla 1948, 177). So, we are free, after all, and\nGod’s foreknowledge does not necessitate the future; but how exactly\nValla thinks his views settle these issues is not clear. Even though\nthe tone of the piece is strongly fideistic, Valla does not shrink\nfrom discussing the issue of God’s providence and free will, just as\nhe had tried to analyze the Trinity in his\nRepastinatio. \n\nIn conclusion, Valla’s moral thought can be described—with\nsome justice—as hedonistic, voluntarist, and perhaps also\nempirical (in the sense of taking account of how people actually\nbehave). On closer inspection, however, his account seems to contain\nthe seeds of several ideas that are not so easily reconciled with one\nanother. This is doubtless due, in no small measure, to his\neclecticism, his attempt to bring into one picture Aristotelian\nethics, the Stoic virtues of Cicero, the biblical concepts of charity\nand beatitude, and the Epicurean notion of hedonist pleasure—\neach with its own distinctive terminology, definitions, and\nphilosophical context. \n\nValla’s contributions to historical, classical, and biblical\nscholarship are beyond doubt, and helped to pave the way for the\ncritical textual philology of Poliziano, Erasmus, and later generations\nof humanists. Valla grasped the important insight—which was not\nunknown to medieval scholars—that the meaning of a text can be\nunderstood only when it is seen as the product of its original\nhistorical and cultural context. Yet his attempt to reform or transform\nthe scholastic study of language and argumentation—and, indeed,\ntheir entire mode of doing philosophy—is likely to be met with\nskepticism or even hostility by the historian of medieval philosophy\nwho is dedicated to the argumentative rigor and conceptual analysis\nwhich are the hallmarks of scholastic thought. Nevertheless, while it\nmay be true that Valla’s individual arguments are sometimes weak,\nsuperficial, and unfair, his critique as a whole does have an important\nphilosophical and historical significance. The following two points, in\nparticular, should be mentioned. \n\nFirst, the humanist study of Stoicism, Epicureanism, skepticism, and\nNeoplatonism widened the philosophical horizon and eroded faith in the\nuniversal truth of Aristotelian philosophy—an essential\npreparatory stage for the rise of early modern thought. In Valla’s\nday, Aristotle was still “the Philosopher,” and\nscholastics put considerable effort into explaining his words. Valla\nattacks what he sees as the ipse dixit attitude of the\nscholastics. For him, a true philosopher does not follow a single\nmaster but instead says whatever he thinks.  Referring to Pythagoras’\nmodest claim that he was a not a wise man but a lover of wisdom\n(Repastinatio, 1), Valla maintains that he does not belong to\nany sect (including that of the skeptics) and wants to retain his\nindependence as critical thinker. What the scholastics forget, he\nthinks, is that there were many alternatives in antiquity to the\nsupposedly great master, many sects, and many other types of\nphilosopher. In criticizing Aristotle’s natural philosophy, for\ninstance, he gave vent to a sentiment which ultimately eroded faith in\nthe Aristotelian system. Valla rightly saw that Aristotle’s\nconclusions were not in line with everyday observations. This does\nnot, however, mean that he was developing a non-Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy; his rejection of Aristotle’s account of nature was\nprimarily motivated by religious and linguistic\nconsiderations. Indeed, Valla’s insistence on common linguistic usage,\ncombined with his appeal to common sense and his religious fervor,\nseems at times to foster a fideism that is at odds with an exploratory\nattitude towards the natural world. But with hindsight we can say\nthat any undermining of the faith in the exclusiveness of the\nscholastic-Aristotelian worldview contributed to its demise and,\nultimately, to its replacement by a different, mechanistic one. And\nalthough the humanist polemic was only one factor among many others,\nits role in this process was by no means negligible. Likewise, in\nattacking Peripatetic moral philosophy, Valla showed that there were\nalternatives to the Aristotelian paradigm, even though his use of\nEpicureanism and Stoicism was rhetorical rather than historical. \n\nThe second point relates to the previous one. In placing himself in\nopposition to what he regarded as the Aristotelian paradigm, Valla\noften interprets certain doctrines—the syllogism, hypothetical\nsyllogism, modal propositions, and the square of contraries—in\nways they were not designed for. In such cases, we can see Valla\nstarting, as it were, from the inside of the Aristotelian paradigm,\nfrom some basic assumptions and ideas of his opponents, in order to\nrefute them by using a kind of reductio ad absurdum or\nsubmitting them to his own criteria, which are external to the\nparadigm. This moving inside and outside of the Aristotelian paradigm\ncan explain (and perhaps excuse) Valla’s inconsistency, for it is an\ninconsistency which is closely tied to his tactics and his agenda. He\ndoes not want to be consistent if this means merely obeying the rules\nof the scholastics, which in his view amounted to rigorously defining\none’s terms and pressing these into the straightjacket of a\nsyllogistic argument, no matter what common sense and linguistic\ncustom teach us. Behind this inconsistency, therefore, lies a\nconsistent program of replacing philosophical speculation and\ntheorizing with an approach based on common linguistic practice and\ncommon sense. But arguably it has also philosophical relevance; for\nthroughout the history of philosophy a warning can be heard against\nabstraction, speculation, and formalization. One need not endorse this\ncautionary note in order to see that philosophy thrives on the\ncreative tension between, on the one hand, a tendency to abstract,\nspeculate, and formalize, and, on the other, a concern that the object\nof philosophical analysis should not be lost from sight, that\nphilosophy should not become a game of its own—an abstract and\ntheoretical affair that leaves the world it purports to analyze and\nexplain far behind, using a language that can be understood only by\nits own practitioners.","contact.mail":"l.w.nauta@rug.nl","contact.domain":"rug.nl"}]
