For instance, philosophers who think that\nlogical laws are not psychological laws would view it as psychologism\nto identify the two. Other authors use the term in a neutral\ndescriptive or even in a positive sense. ‘Psychologism’\nthen refers (approvingly) to positions that apply psychological\ntechniques to traditional philosophical problems (e.g. Ellis 1979,\n1990).\n\n\n‘Psychologism’ entered the English language as a\ntranslation of the German word ‘Psychologismus’,\na term coined by the Hegelian Johann Eduard Erdmann in 1870 to\ncritically characterize the philosophical position of Eduard Beneke\n(Erdmann 1870).\n\n\nAlthough the term continues to be used today, criticisms and defenses\nof psychologism have mostly been absorbed into wider debates over the\npros and cons of philosophical naturalism. Therefore this entry \nfocuses on a time when, and a place where, psychologism was still a\nmuch-debated distinct issue.\n\nThe relationship between logic and psychology was fought over most\nintensely in the German-speaking lands between 1890 and 1914. Indeed,\nduring this period pretty much all of German-speaking philosophy was\nengulfed in the so-called Psychologismus-Streit (the\n‘psychologism dispute’). This dispute centered on the\nquestion whether logic (and epistemology) are parts of psychology.\nGottlob Frege and Edmund Husserl are the best-known figures of this\ncontroversy. The fact that the psychologism dispute has become closely\nassociated with German-speaking philosophy must not, however, blind us\nto the enormous influence of John Stuart Mill upon both sides of the\ncontroversy. Paradoxically, Mill’s Logic of 1843 was\nnot only a key inspiration behind much German-speaking psychologistic\nphilosophy, it also contained some crucially important\nanti-psychologistic ideas. \nIn what follows, I shall begin with a short summary of Mill’s\ncontribution. Subsequently, and turning to the German scene, I shall\nbriefly sketch what authors accused of psychologism said on the\nrelationship between logic and psychology, before outlining\nFrege’s and Husserl’s arguments against them. I shall\nconclude by presenting a number of objections to Frege’s and\nHusserl’s anti-psychologism. Some of these objections come from\nFrege’s and Husserl’s contemporaries, others are of more\nrecent origin. \n(Important papers on the emergence of psychologism in\nnineteenth-century German philosophy are George 1997, Peckhaus 2006\nand Stelzner 2005. The most important monograph is Beiser 2014. Gray\n2008 contains many important observations on early psychologistic\ntendencies in mathematics and logic.)  \nCritics and interpreters of Mill’s philosophy of logic have been\nunable to reach a verdict on the question whether Mill was a\npsychologistic thinker. Recent work by David Godden (2005) provides a\ndetailed explanation for this lack of agreement: Mill’s position\non the relationship between (deductive) logic and psychology is\n“fractured”. Some elements in Mill’s thought push\nhim towards a strongly psychologistic viewpoint, other elements pull\nhim away from it. In other words, sometimes Mill insists that logic\ndepends on psychology, sometimes he denies such dependence. (This\nsection is based on Godden’s important re-assessment.) \nAs Mill declares as the beginning of his System of Logic,\nlogic has two parts: the ‘science of reasoning, as well as an\nart, founded on that science’ (1843, 4). The art of reasoning is\nprescriptive; it provides us with the rules according to which we\nought to reason. The science of reasoning is a descriptive-explanatory\npsychological discipline and analyses mental processes. The overall\ngoal of logic is ‘the guidance of one’s own\nthoughts’ (1843, 6). The crucial question here is of course how\nthe dependence of the art of reasoning upon the psychological science\nis to be understood. The mere fact that the art is prescriptive does\nnot yet make it independent of psychology. \nAt this point it is important to note that Mill’s science of\nreasoning really is, in both subject matter and methodology, a\npsychological discipline. Although the subject matter of the science\nof reasoning is more specific than that of psychology in general\n— the former investigates ‘the operations of the human\nunderstanding in the pursuit of truth’ (1843, 6) — there\nare, as Mill sees it, no special psychological laws characteristic\nexclusively of the domain of the science of reasoning. Instead,\n‘the general laws of association prevail among these more\nintricate states of mind’ (1843, 856). Moreover, in both the\ngeneral and the more specific domain, the discovery of laws is due to\n‘the ordinary methods of experimental inquiry’ (1843,\n853). \nMill offers at least three different accounts of the contribution\nwhich the psychological science of reasoning makes to the art of\nreasoning. On the first account, the prescriptive art of reasoning\nseems prima facie independent of psychological science. In\nthis vein Mill writes, for example, that psychology can only offer\n‘the analysis of the mental process which takes place whenever\nwe reason’, whereas the art of reasoning must provide ‘the\nrules … for conducting the [reasoning] process correctly’\n(1843, 4). A second account is based on the idea that any successful\nprescription for a given type of thought process must be based on a\nproper and detailed psychological understanding of that process:\n‘A right understanding of the mental process itself … is\nthe only basis on which a system of rules, fitted for the direction of\nthe process, can possibly be founded’ (ibid.). And\nMill’s third account goes further still: ‘Its [the Science\nof Logic’s] theoretic grounds are wholly borrowed from\nPsychology, and include as much of that science as is required to\njustify the rules of the art’ (1865, 359). On the third account,\npsychology is essential to the justification of the rules of\nreasoning. Mill provides no clear indications on how these prima\nfacie conflicting statements can be reconciled. Clearly the third\nstatement will qualifies as psychologistic by everybody’s\ncriteria — though doubts have been raised whether, ‘when\nthis passage is read in its full dialectical context’, it\namounts to more than the claim that ‘the logician must formulate\nrules of inquiry in a manner which will be as helpful as possible to\ninquirers, and must draw on the psychology of thought to do so’\n(Skorupski 1989, 166). But even the first two accounts, interpreted\nagainst the backdrop of Mill’s other views, make prescriptive\nlogic dependent upon psychology. Logic cannot begin its task until\npsychology has provided a descriptive analysis of reasoning\nprocesses. \nWe encounter a similar mixture of psychologistic and\nanti-psychologistic motifs also as we turn to Mill’s views on\nhow the logician ought to justify logical precepts and principles. For\nMill, we specify the rules of deductive inference by identifying the\nvalid forms of the syllogism (1843, 168). And validity is explained by\nthe formula ‘if the premises are true, the conclusion must\ninevitably be so’ (1843, 166). ‘Good inferences’\nhave an connection to truth: ‘A reasoning, to be rightly framed,\nmust conduct to a true conclusion’ (1865, 365). And hence \nA ‘good’ inference is thus a ‘true inference’,\nan inference ‘grounded in the reality of things’ (1843,\n10–11). \nIn line with this consideration, Mill distinguishes between\nact, content and object of a judgement. The\ncontent of a judgement accounts for its representational connection to\nthe external world. And the truth of a judgement depends on its\nobject, that is, the state of affairs represented by the content. Thus\nwhen it comes to identifying valid inferences, logic must focus on\nobjects (1843, 87). Mill’s theory of judgements and their truth\ninvolves a rejection of ‘conceptualism’, the view that the\nobjects of judgements are mental, and that ‘a proposition is the\nexpression of a relation between two ideas’ (1843, 109). Against\nthis view Mill insists that ‘propositions … are not\nassertions respecting our ideas of things, but assertions respecting\nthe things themselves’ (1843, 88). \nIt is easy to understand why some authors have taken such statements\nas evidence that Mill was defending an anti-psychologistic position of\nsorts. And yet, we must remember that these statements directly\ncontradict other of his pronouncements, some of which were quoted\nearlier. Recall only that Mills defines logic as ‘the science of\nthe operations of the human understanding in the pursuit of\ntruth’ (1843, 6). There is no denying that Mill’s theory\nof logic contains incompatible views. \nGodden (2005) shows convincingly that even Mill’s object-focused\nproject eventually circles back towards psychologism. First of all,\nMill offers affirmative and negative formulations of the Principle of\nthe Transitivity of Co-existence as the ultimate foundation of all\nsyllogistic reasoning: \nSecond, although Mill never seeks in turn to provide a justification\nfor the Principle of Transitivity of Co-existence, it is not difficult\nto work out what for him such justification would have to look like.\nThe parallel case of geometric axioms is clear enough: ‘It\nremains to inquire, what is the ground for belief in axioms —\nwhat is the evidence on which they rest? I answer, they are\nexperimental truths; generalisations from observation’ (1843,\n231). For Mill all general propositions must ultimately be justified\nby experience: \nThird, Mill reverts to a full-blown form of psychologism when turning\nto the justification of other logical principles, in particular the\nPrinciple of Non-Contradiction. Mill insists that it too is an\nempirical generalisation over our experience, and especially over our\ninner experience: \nHere again the foundations of logical truths cannot be understood and\nexplained independently of psychology. Mill offers a similar analysis\nof the Principle of the Excluded Middle (1843, 278–9). \nFourth, what pushes Mill back into a psychologistic position is his\nphenomenalism. In his argument with Hamilton, Mill maintains that the\nfundamental logical principles apply not to things in themselves, but\nonly to the objects of our experience. The laws of logic are\n‘laws of all Phænomena’ (1865, 381–2).\nAccordingly, the fundamental principles of logic — the\nPrinciples of Non-Contradiction, the Excluded Middle and Identity,\n \nAnd with this claim Mill’s position is once more back in the\npsychologistic camp. \nAlthough the exact definition of ‘psychologism’ was itself\npart and parcel of the Psychologismus-Streit, most\nGerman-speaking philosophers, from the 1880s onwards, agreed that the\nfollowing arguments deserved the label ‘psychologistic’ (I\nshall write PA for ‘psychologistic\nargument’): \nWho actually held these views, indeed whether anyone did, was hotly\ncontested at the time, but it seems reasonable to attribute PA\n1 to Theodor Lipps (1893) and Gerardus Heymans (1894, 1905),\nPA 2 to Wilhelm Wundt (1880/83), PA 3 to Wilhelm\nJerusalem (1905) and Christoph Sigwart (1921), PA 4 to\nTheodor Elsenhans (1897), and PA 5 to Benno Erdmann (1892).\nWe might also note a couple of quotations that for many authors at the\ntime were paradigmatic expressions of psychologism. The bulk of the\nfirst quotation comes from Mill’s Logic and has already\nbeen quoted in the last section: \nAnd Theodor Lipps held that \nConsider first Frege’s Grundlagen der Arithmetik\n(1884). One of Frege’s main thesis is that mathematics and logic\nare not part of psychology, and that the objects and laws of\nmathematics and psychology are not defined, illuminated, proven true,\nor explained by psychological observations and results. One of\nFrege’s central arguments for this thesis is the consideration\nthat whereas mathematics is the most exact of all sciences, psychology\nis imprecise and vague (1884, 38). Thus it is implausible to assume\nthat mathematics could possibly be based upon, or be a part of,\npsychology. A closely related further point is that we need to\ndistinguish between psychological ‘ideas’\n(Vorstellungen) and their objects. This distinction is\nespecially important when the latter are objective or ideal. Numbers,\nfor example, are objective and ideal entities, and thus they differ\nfundamentally from ideas. Ideas are always subjective and\nidiosyncratic. In this context Frege laments the fact that the term\n‘idea’ has also been used for objective, essentially\nnon-sensual, abstract and objective entities (1884, 37). Frege rejects\npsychological or physiological interpretations of the Kantian\ndistinctions between the a priori and the a posteriori, and the\nanalytic and the synthetic; as Frege has, it these distinctions\nconcern different ways in which judgments are justified or proven\ntrue, not different operations of the human mind (1884, 3).  \nA central theme of the Grundlagen is a detailed criticism of\nMill’s philosophy of mathematics. Frege argues that mathematical\ntruths are not empirical truths and that numbers cannot be properties\nof aggregates of objects. First, Frege denies Mill’s claim that\nmathematical statements are about matters of fact. Frege’s\nobjection is that there is no physical fact of the matter to which the\nnumbers 0 or 777864 refer. Moreover, someone who learns how to\ncalculate does not thereby gain any new empirical knowledge (1884,\n9–11). Second, Frege insists that there is no general inductive\nlaw from which all mathematical sentences can be said to follow (1884,\n10). Third, while Frege grants Mill that some empirical knowledge may\nwell be necessary for us to learn mathematics, he points out that\nempirical knowledge cannot justify mathematical truths (1884, 12).\nFourth, Frege counters Mill’s claim according to which numbers\nare properties of aggregates of objects with the observations that\naggregates do not have — in and of themselves —\ncharacteristic manners in which they can be divided. Frege also points\nout that the numbers 0 and 1 are not aggregates at all. And finally,\nFrege accuses Mill of overlooking that numbers can be predicated of\nboth concrete and abstract objects (1884, 31). \nFrege continues his criticism of psychological logic in the\n‘Foreword’ of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\n(1893). He begins by pointing out that the word ‘law’ is\nambiguous: it can refer to descriptive or to prescriptive laws.\nExamples of the former are the laws of physics, examples of the latter\nare moral laws (1893, XV). Frege suggests that every descriptive law\ncan be reformulated as a prescription to think in accordance with it.\nFor instance, true descriptive laws ought to be accepted. Hence they\ncan be prefixed by the prescription: ‘accept the truth of\n…’. In other cases the prescription might be a set of\ninstructions on how to reach the truth stated in a descriptive law.\nFrege’s main point in all this is that whereas all\nprescriptive laws can be categorized as ‘laws of thought’\non the basis that they tell what we ought to think, only one\nkind of descriptive laws deserves to be come under the same heading:\nthe set of psychological descriptive laws (ibid.).  \nFrege claims that in the realm of logic we find both descriptive and\nprescriptive laws, with the former being the foundation for the\nlatter. The point merits stressing since it is sometimes suggested\nthat for Frege the opposition between psychological laws and logical\nlaws is the is-ought opposition (e.g. Føllesdal 1958, 49). But\nnote that Frege writes: \nThus logical laws are primarily descriptive laws even though, like\nother descriptive laws, they too can be reformulated or apprehended as\nprescriptive laws. These distinctions allow Frege to distinguish\nbetween two versions of ‘psychological logicians’: one\ngroup takes the laws of logic to be descriptive psychological laws,\nthe other group interprets the laws of logic as prescriptive laws\nbased on descriptive psychological laws. It is the ambiguity of the\nexpression ‘law of thought’ that invites these confusions\n(1893, XV). \nFrege’s main criticism of psychological logic is that it\nconflates ‘true’ and ‘being-taken-to-be-true’.\nTo begin with, Frege denies that prescriptions based on psychological\nlaws can qualify as proper logical laws. Such prescriptions can be no\nmore than demands to conform to current thinking habits. But they\ncannot be yardsticks by which these thinking habits can be evaluated\nas to their truth. Moreover, Frege points out that the descriptive\npsychological laws which for the psychological logician provide the\nbasis for (psycho-)logical prescriptions are laws of\n‘taking-to-be-true’: they state the conditions under which\nhumans accept the truth of judgments or the validity of inferences;\nbut they do not determine the conditions under which judgments are\ntrue and inferences valid. Here Frege is particularly scathing of the\npsychological logician Benno Erdmann who identifies truth with general\nconsensus. For Frege this move makes truth dependent upon\nwhat-is-taken-to-be-true. And it fails to give proper heed to the\ninsight that truth is independent of people’s agreement. It\nfollows that the laws of logic are not psychological laws: ‘If\nbeing true is thus independent of being acknowledged by somebody or\nother, then the laws of truth are not psychological laws: they are\nboundary stones set in an eternal foundation, which our thought can\noverflow but never displace’ (1893, XVI). Frege’s attack\non Erdmann does not end here. Erdmann is also taken to task for his\nsuggestion that logical laws might have mere ‘hypothetical\nnecessity’, that is, that they are relative to the human\nspecies. Frege maintains that if we were to encounter creatures who\ndeny the laws of logic, we would take them to be insane; and he\nanalyses Erdmann’s proposal as reducing, yet again, truth to\nwhat-is-taken-to-be-true (1893, XVI–XVII). At the same time, Frege\naccepts that the most fundamental logical laws cannot be justified.\nLogical justification comes to an end when we reach these laws.\nHowever, to argue that our nature or constitution forces us to abide\nby the laws of logic is no longer a logical justification; it\nis to incorrectly shift from logical to psychological or biological\nconsiderations (1893, XVI–XVII). \nFor Frege the opposition between truth and what-is-taking-to-be-true\nis closely linked to the distinction between accepting and rejecting\nthe realm of objective and non-real entities. Frege insists that the\nrealm of the non-real is not identical with the realm of the\npsychological and subjective. His example of objective,\nnon-psychological entities are numbers. Numbers are not ideas since\nthey are the same for all subjects (1893, XVIII). Moreover, Frege\ntries to convince us that the denial of the objectivity and\nnon-reality of numbers and concepts leads fairly directly into\nidealism and solipsism. Since psychological logicians try so hard to\nbreak down the distinction between the realms of the objective-ideal\nand the subjective-psychological, they easily are tempted to go\nfurther and challenge the borderline between the\nsubjective-psychological and the objective-real. The resulting\nstandpoint is idealism and solipsism: idealism since the only existing\nentities are ideas; solipsism since all ideas are relative to\nsubjects. And thus the possibility of communication is a further\nvictim of their efforts (1893, XIX). Again Frege is eager to show that\nErdmann’s logic is guilty of the charges. He therefore points\nout that Erdmann calls both hallucinated objects and numbers\n‘objects of an ideal nature’; that Erdmann fails to\ndistinguish between acts and contents of judgments; and that Erdmann\nlacks the conceptual resources to distinguish between ideas and\nrealities (1893, XX–XXIII).  \nFrege’s alternative is of course to emphasize that\ncoming-to-know is an activity that grasps rather than\ncreates objects. This choice of terminology is meant to bring\nout that what we come to know is (usually) independent of us.\nAfter all, when we grasp a physical object like a pencil, the object\nis independent both of the act of grasping and of the human actor of\nthe grasping (1893, XXIV). \nFrege’s third anti-psychologistic discussion is his 1894-review\nof Husserl’s Philosophie der Arithmetik (1891). I shall\nnot here enter into the debate over whether it was Frege’s\ncriticism that turned Husserl away from psychologism (cf. Kusch 1995,\n12–13). Nor shall I try to adjudicate whether Frege’s\ncritique was justified. Suffice it here to point out that\nFrege’s review classifies Husserl as a psychological logician on\nthe grounds that Husserl treats the meanings of words, concepts and\nobjects as different kinds of ideas (1894, 316); that Husserl provides\npsychological-genetic accounts of the origins of abstract concepts\n(1894, 317); and that Husserl, like Erdmann, equivocates on the notion\nof idea: in some places in his book, concepts and objects are\nunderstood as subjective, in other places they are taken to be\nobjective (1894, 318). In his criticism of Husserl’s\npsychological explanation of the genesis of the number concept, Frege\ndoes not confine himself to contrasting Husserl’s theory with\nhis own account of numbers. He also points out that the various\npsychological processes which Husserl’s theory assumes are\nspurious. For instance, Frege denies that we can combine any arbitrary\ncontents into one idea without relating these contents to one another.\nHe also rejects Husserl’s claim that we can abstract from all\ndifferences between two contents and still retain their numerical\ndistinctness (1894, 316, 323).  \nHusserl’s criticism of psychologism in the Prolegomena\nof the Logische Untersuchungen was the key text in the\nGerman-speaking debate over psychologism during the first\ndecade-and-a-half of the twentieth century (Husserl 1900). The\nProlegomena fall roughly into three parts. Part One\nidentifies the sense in which logic is a ‘practical-normative\ndiscipline’ (Kunstlehre) (Chapters 1 and 2). Part Two\nargues at great length that the theoretical foundations of the logical\npractical-normative discipline are not psychological (Chapters 3 to\n10). And Part Three provides an overview over the true foundations of\nlogic as a practical-normative discipline (Chapter 11). I have\nreconstructed all three parts in some detail elsewhere (Kusch 1995,\n41–60), here I shall concentrate on Part Two. (Important recent\ndiscussions of Husserl’s arguments include Carr 2007, Hanna\n2008, Hopkins 2006, Moran 2008, Pelletier et al. 2008.) \nFrom Part One we here need only two ideas. First, logic as a\npractical-normative discipline vis-à-vis the sciences\nis a theory of science (Wissenschaftslehre). It evaluates the\nmethods of scientific justification, and in so doing it addresses the\nquestions: Under what (empirical) conditions can valid methods be used\nsuccessfully? What is the internal conceptual structure of each of the\nsciences, and how can they be demarcated from one another? And how can\nscientists avoid making mistakes? (§§5–11) Second,\nnormative disciplines have non-normative theoretical foundations\nbelonging to one or more non-normative theoretical discipline\n(§§14–16).  \nHusserl begins his discussion of psychologism in Part Two with a\ncriticism of what one might call ‘normative\nanti-psychologism’, that is, the view that psychology and logic\nare divided by the is-ought distinction (§17). He sides with the\nproponents of psychologism who maintain that thought as it ought\nto occur is but a special case of thought as it in fact\noccurs. Nor is it right, Husserl thinks, to accuse psychologism\nof circularity; some critics of psychologism had argued that one\ncannot base normative logic on psychology since psychology itself has\nsome of its foundations in logic. But this misses an important\ndistinction. Psychology can either take the laws of logic as premises\nand axioms of its own theories, or it can rely on the laws of logic\nmerely as rules of method in accordance with which psychology\nmust proceed. If psychology did the former, psychologism would involve\na vicious circle. But psychology presupposes laws of logic only in the\nsecond, weaker, sense. And hence psychologism is not based upon a\nfatal circularity (§19). \nHaving dismissed these two older forms of antipsychologism, Husserl\nmoves on to present his own arguments. One main train of thought\ncenters on the three empiricist consequences of psychologism. They can\nbe reconstructed as follows: \nFirst Consequence: If logical rules were based upon\npsychological laws, then all logical rules would have to be as vague\nas the underlying psychological laws. \nRefutation: Not all logical rules are vague. And therefore\nnot all logical rules are based upon psychological laws.\n(§21). \nSecond Consequence: If laws of logic were psychological laws,\nthen they could not be known a priori. They would be more or less\nprobable rather than Valid, and justified only by reference to\nexperience. \nRefutation: Laws of logic are a priori, they are justified by\napodictic self-evidence, and valid rather than probable. And therefore\nlaws of logic are not psychological (§21).  \nThird Consequence: If logical laws were psychological laws,\nthey would refer to psychological entities. \nRefutation: Logical laws do not refer to psychological\nentities. And therefore logical laws are not psychological laws\n(§23). \nHusserl also claims that psychologism fails to do justice to the idea\nthat truths are eternal. It is precisely because truths are eternal\nthat logical laws cannot be laws about states of affairs (be they\nmental or physical). Husserl attempts to prove this claim by showing\nthat the opposite assumption leads to paradoxes. \nTake a logical law like (*).  \nAnd then assume (a)–(d): \n(a) Laws about states of affairs are laws about the coming to\nbe and passing away of states of affairs. \n(b) (*) is a truth. \n(c) (*) is a law about truths. \n(d) Laws about truths are laws about state of affairs. \nThen two paradoxical conclusions follow: \n(e) Laws about truths are laws about the coming to be and\npassing away of truths. \n(f) Laws about truths are laws about the coming to be and\npassing away of laws about truths (§24; Kusch 1995, 47). \nHusserl also seeks to show that psychological interpretations of the\nbasic logical principles and the laws of syllogistics are\nunsatisfactory. As far as the basic principles are concerned, Husserl\ntargets for example Spencer’s psychological rendering of the\nPrinciple of Non-Contradiction. He quotes Spencer as saying that \nIn Husserl’s view Spencer’s sentence is a tautology since\npositive and negative modes already form a pair of contradictory\nopposites. However, Husserl insists, the Principle of\nNon-Contradiction is no tautology (§26). Concerning\npsychologistic views of syllogistics, Husserl’s main target is\nthe Dutch psychologist and philosopher Gerardus Heymans. On the one\nhand, Husserl points out that if the laws of syllogistics were laws of\nthought, then we would never commit fallacies. On the other hand, a\npsychological interpretation of syllogistics cannot explain\nwhy some inferences are valid and others invalid\n(§31). \nLike Frege, Husserl ultimately seeks to refute psychologism by linking\nit closely to broader and (at the time) disreputable philosophical\npositions. But for Husserl the focus is less on subjective idealism\nand solipsism and more on skepticism and relativism. Husserl contends\nthat all forms of psychologism are forms of ‘species\nrelativism’, more precisely ‘anthropologism’. And he\ngoes on to argue that such relativism is ‘absurd’. In\norder to get to this general conclusion, Husserl begins by arguing\nagainst Protagorean relativism. While acknowledging that the true\nProtagorean relativist can never be argued out of his position,\nHusserl holds that we ‘normally disposed’ people can\nnevertheless see what is wrong with the Protagorean viewpoint: the\nsame sentence cannot be both true and false, and the Protagorean\nthesis, ‘truth is relative’, cannot itself be merely\nrelatively true. (§35). Species relativism (and thus\nanthropologism) is equally absurd, but a little harder to refute.\nHusserl marshals a number of arguments against species relativism; the\nmost important are (a) that since the Principle of\nNon-Contradiction is part of the meaning of truth, one and the same\nthought cannot be true for one species and false for another;\n(b) that truth are eternal and thus not temporally and\nspatially determined; and (c) that if truth were relative\nthen so would be the existence of the world. This is because the world\nis the correlate of the ideal system of all factual truths. If truth\nwere relative then there would be no such ideal system and thus no one\nunique world (§36).  \nHaving convinced himself that anthropologism is self-refuting, Husserl\nturns in some detail to showing all forms of psychologism are forms of\nanthropologism (§38). The views of Erdmann and Sigwart receive\nmost of his attention. In Sigwart’s case, Husserl criticizes,\namongst other things, the view according to which it would be wrong to\nassume that a judgment could be true even if no intellect were ever\nthinking this judgment. Husserl objects with the thought that it is\npart of the meaning of the law of gravity that it is true for all\ntimes (even prior to its discovery) regardless of whether it happens\nto be thought by anyone or not (§39) In Erdmann’s case\nHusserl goes to even greater lengths in order to unearth what he\nregards as fatal flaws and inconsistencies. The central issue for\nHusserl is Erdmann’s claim that logical laws are merely\nhypothetically necessary, that is, that logical laws are necessary\nonly for members of the human species up until the present (§40).\nPerhaps the most important argument is that Erdmann’s position\nin inherently unstable: on the one hand, Erdmann argues for the\nhypothetical necessity, or species-relativity, of logical laws be\ninsisting that we cannot imagine alternatives to logical laws. On the\nother hand, Erdmann holds that therefore logical laws are\npsychological laws. Husserl objects that these two theses do not fit\ntogether since we can always imagine alternatives to psychological\nlaws (§41). \nThe last major step in Husserl’s overall argument is to show\nthat psychologism is based upon three — more or less easily\nrefutable — ‘prejudices’: \nThis is wrong since logical prescriptions are fully grounded in logic\nas a theoretical, non-normative discipline (§41).  \nThat this is a prejudice, Husserl argues, can be seen from the fact\nthat a similar line of thought would lead one to the claim that\nmathematics is a branch of psychology. And he goes on to suggest that\nmathematical psychologism has already been refuted by the likes of\nLotze, Riehl, Frege and Natorp (§45). \nTo this Husserl replies that purely logical sentences say nothing\nabout self-evidence and its conditions. Husserl makes three proposals\nconcerning self-evidence. First, self-evidence is the\nexperience, or a criterion, of truth. To experience\nthat an assertion corresponds to an experienced state of affairs is to\nhave self-evidence for that assertion. But self-evidence is no\nadditional ingredient of this experience. Second, truths are ideal\nspecies of the ideal genus truth, that is, truths are ideal\nparticulars. These ideal species are independent of whatever humans\nclaim to be self-evident. And third, when one person claims that\np is self-evident, whereas another person claims that\n~p is self-evident, then one of them is wrong. Put\ndifferently, truth is prior to self-evidence (§51). \n(For other detailed interpretations of Husserl’s arguments see\nTieszen 2008 and Hanna 2008.)  \nWhile Frege’s antipsychologism received scant attention,\nHusserl’s Prolegomena were widely discussed in\nGerman-speaking philosophy between 1901 and 1920. Here I shall only be\nable to present a few of the critical replies (cf. Kusch 1995, Chs. 4\nand 5). While my selection is itself based upon an evaluation —\nI have tried to pick arguments with at least some (initial)\nplausibility — I shall not here try to assess the strengths and\nweaknesses of the various responses. Nor do I have the space to\ndescribe the more general, and sometimes highly contested,\nphilosophical presuppositions upon which the replies are based.  \nThe Southwest-German School of Neokantians was particularly critical\nof Husserl’s claim that logic qua normative-practical\ndiscipline must be based upon logic as a theoretical science. On their\nbehalf, Richard Kroner (1909) defended the view that logical laws are\nimperatives, and that these imperatives are founded on values (1909,\n241). Kroner insists that not all ‘ought-sentences’ are\nfounded on non-normative, theoretical sentences. Only hypothetical\nimperatives (and their cognate ought-sentences) fit Husserl’s\nanalysis. For instance, the hypothetical ought-sentence (a)\n… \n… indeed presupposes the theoretical, non-normative sentence\n(b) … \nHowever, categorical ought-sentences demand a different\nanalysis, Kroner maintains. The categorical ought-sentence\n(a′) … \n… is not based upon the theoretical sentence\n(b′) … \nIn the case of categorical ought-sentences, the order of\npresupposition is reversed: the non-normative sentence\n(b′) derives its justification or meaning from the\nnormative one (a′). To model the relation between\n(a′) and (b′) on the relation between\n(a) and (b) ‘would be to practice moral\nphilosophy in a Socratic fashion, that is, it would imply a one-sided\nintellectualistic interpretation of the concept of value’ (1909,\n242). Kroner thinks that the case of logic is similar to the case of\nmorals. The highest logical norm is something like (a″)\n… \n… and this norm is primary with respect to (b″)\n… \nAnd this analysis of the most basic logical norm also applies to all\nother logical norms (1909, 242). (For important recent discussion of\nthe relation between Neokantianism and psychologism, see Anderson\n2005, Beiser 2009, Edgar 2007.)  \nHusserl’s (and Frege’s) arguments for a sharp distinction\nbetween logical and psychological laws — that that only the\nlatter are vague and based on induction — were targeted often;\nespecially forcefully by Moritz Schlick (1910): \nOr: \nHusserl’s characterization of logical laws as known a priori\nalso met with opposition. According to Gerardus Heymans, all\nepistemology can say, for the time being, with respect to a logical\nlaw like the Principle of Non-Contradiction is that\n‘probably all human beings reject contradiction’\n(1905, 66). Our knowledge of logical laws is more probable than our\nknowledge of other psychological laws only ‘because we\nexperiment, throughout our life, daily and every hour, with these\nelementary relations between phenomena of consciousness’ (1905,\n33). \nSchlick (1910) also challenges Husserl’s claim that laws of\nlogic do not imply the existence of matters of fact. Schlick maintains\nthat psychological acts of judgment and logical sentences are\nintertwined, such that the logical sentence and its truth \nDefenders of psychologistic renderings of logical principles and\nsyllogistic also stood their ground. Recall that Husserl argued\nagainst Heymans as follows:  \nIn his reply, Heymans denies Husserl’s claim according to which\nfallacies are deviations from the laws of syllogistics. For Heymans,\nsomeone who does not derive the right conclusion from given premises\nis confused about the meaning of the major, middle or minor terms, not\nlacking knowledge of the inference schemes. In the case of fallacies\nthe causes of the deviation from the laws of syllogistics are \nSome of Husserl’s case against psychologism rested on showing\nthat it is a form of skeptical relativism, and that skeptical\nrelativism is self-refuting. The latter claim was first doubted by\nPaul Natorp (1901). In his review of the Prolegomena Natorp\nhints at the possibility that Husserl’s arguments against\nrelativism and skepticism are guilty of a petitio: \nRecall that Husserl’s case against psychologism centrally relies\non the claim that truths exist independently of whether or not they\nare ever grasped by anyone. Schlick (1910) called this assumption\n‘the independence theory of truth’. It was frequently\nattacked. Since Husserl provided the clearest statement of the\nindependence theory of truth in the context of his criticism of\nChristoph Sigwart, it seems only fair to start the summary of\nrepudiations with this author. In the Prolegomena Husserl\ndisagrees with Sigwart’s claim that no judgment can be true\nunless it is actually thought by someone. Husserl regards it as part\nof the meaning of the law of gravity that the law is true for all\ntimes, that is, even prior to its discovery and regardless of whether\nit is ever formulated by anyone. Sigwart (1921) accuses Husserl of\nconflating truth with reality: \nSchlick (1910) agrees: ‘There is no truth of judgments such that\nthis truth is independent of the judgments’ existence in mental\nacts. Only the facts upon which true judgments are based, are\nindependent of us’ (403). However, Schlick goes further than\nSigwart by trying to explain Husserl’s alleged conflation:  \nHusserl’s distinction between the act and content of judgments\nwas questioned by other commentators as well. Wilhelm Jerusalem (1905)\nputs his criticism in the context of a defense of species relativism.\nHe especially disagrees with Husserl’s claim that ‘the\nsame content of a judgment cannot be true for one species and false\nfor another’. Jerusalem replies: \nHusserl’s equation of psychologism with species relativism was\nfirst and foremost targeting Erdmann. In a footnote to the second\nedition of his Logische Elementarlehre (1907), Erdmann\nlaments that Husserl has misconstrued his views. And in a footnote he\ngives a new defense of his claim that the laws of logic have only\nhypothetical necessity: \nIn Husserl’s overall argument, self-evidence figures in two\ndistinct ways. On the one hand, Husserl claims self-evidence for the\nthought that no other species could have a different logic from ours.\nOn the other hand, Husserl denies both that purely logical sentences\nsay anything about self-evidence and that self-evidence is a criterion\nof truth.  \nCritics of Husserl’s view on self-evidence attacked one or both\nof these lines of thought. Wilhelm Wundt (1910) for example complains\nthat Husserl never gives satisfactory definitions of his key terms: in\nHusserl’s Logische Untersuchungen \nWundt suggests the following explanation for Husserl’s alleged\ninability to define self-evidence: \nSchlick (1910) is especially concerned to point out that\nHusserl’s two treatments of self-evidence contradict one\nanother. As Schlick sees it, the second employment contradicts the\nfirst. Schlick writes: \nGiven the central position of Frege’s and Husserl’s work\nin modern analytic and ‘Continental’ philosophy, it is of\ncourse not surprising that critical re-appraisals of their\nanti-psychologism did not stop when the Psychologismus-Streit\nended around 1914. Here is a brief glimpse at more recent evaluations.\nInterestingly enough, many recent re-evaluations of\nturn-of-the-century antipsychologism conclude that Frege’s and\nHusserl’s arguments are question-begging. My aim again is to\ngive a brief overview of the range of responses, not to offer\nassessments. To do so would demand a much more extensive\ndiscussion. \nJ.J. Katz (1981, 175) agrees with Schlick and other early critics that\nFrege and Husserl are wrong to take psychological laws to be vague and\ninexact. Katz’s criticism echoes Schlick’s petitio\nprincipii charge: One \nRecent critics also disagree with Frege’s and Husserl’s\nviews on the nature of logical laws. In the light of the development\nof philosophy and logic over the past 70 years, it is no longer\nevident that the laws of Frege’s and Husserl’s classical\nlogic are necessary and unique. The uniqueness assumption has become\nmore and more questionable as logicians have developed more and more\nlogics (e.g. intuitionist logic, dialethetic paraconsistent and\ndialectical logic, relevance logic). Not only have Frege and Husserl\nfailed to provide procedures for adjudicating between alternative\nlogics (Baker and Hacker 1989, 88), but it has also turned out that\neven the Principle of Non-Contradiction which both Frege and Husserl\nregarded as one of those ‘boundary stones set in an eternal\nfoundation, which our thought can overflow but never displace’,\ncan be violated — without leading to absolute inconsistency.\nIndeed it is violated in every dialethetic system of logic (Massey\n1991, 184). \nWhile some critics of Frege and Husserl are still willing to regard\nthe propositions of logic as ‘paradigms of necessary\ntruth’ (Baker and Hacker 1989, 87), others go further and deny\nlogical laws the status of necessary truths. A weaker form of this\ndenial accepts the notion of necessity as meaningful but holds that\nlogic falls short of necessity. A stronger form rejects the notion of\nnecessity altogether (cf. Pivcevic 1970, 38–41).  \nThe weaker form is sketched in a paper by Gerald Massey (1991). Massey\nsuggests that ‘logic and mathematics … forfeited all\nclaims to the honorific title sciences of necessary truth when they\nadmitted Church’s thesis into their innersanctum’ (1991,\n186). According to Church’s thesis , there is no algorithm that\nis more powerful than a Turing machine. Or, put differently, every\nfunction that is computable at all, is computable on a Turing machine.\nThis thesis is presupposed in establishing very fundamental logical\nresults. It is used, for example in order to prove Church’s\ntheorem which says that there is no algorithmic decision procedure for\nfirst-order logic. Yet Church’s thesis is a mere hypothesis, and\na hypothesis that cannot be proven true. This is because the notion of\nalgorithm is not precisely definable; there is no limit to the variety\nthat an algorithmic routine might assume. Thus Church’s thesis\nmay indeed be false: someone might eventually come up with an\nalgorithm that computes some definite function f that no\nTuring machine can compute (Jeffrey 1989, 132; Massey 1991, 186). \nMassey also invokes the stronger form of the claim that logical truths\nare not necessary (1991, 188). According to this criticism, the very\nnotion of necessity which is presupposed in calling logical laws\n‘necessary truths’, is beset with difficulties. The\nargument leading to this conclusion was developed in a series of\nwell-known papers by Quine. Quine argued that the notions of\nanalyticity, necessity and aprioricity stand or fall together and that\nthe traditional distinction between analytic and synthetic truths is\nrelative rather than absolute. But once this distinction becomes\nrelative, necessity and aprioricity go by the board (Quine 1951, Engel\n1991, 268–70). Massey summarises the implications of\nQuine’s arguments succinctly: \nA different line of attack on Frege’s and Husserl’s\nantipsychologism focuses on the premises that both authors share with\ntheir psychologistic opponents. The most important of such shared\npremises is the idea that the primary cognitive attitude of logic is\ndescriptive rather than prescriptive, that is, that logic describes\nobjects or objectivities (Sachverhalte). Of course Frege and\nHusserl, on the one hand, and their psychologistic foes, on the other\nhand, disagree over the nature of these objects and objectivities\n— for the psychologicists these are real or psychological,\nwhereas for Frege and Husserl they are ideal. But the fact remains\nthat both sides in the dispute see logic as essentially descriptive\n(for Husserl, see Gethmann 1989, 197; for Frege, see Baker and Hacker:\n1989, 88–90). \nCentral to Frege’s and Husserl’s criticism of psychologism\nis the idea that psychologism turns out to be a relativism of sorts.\nFrege goes no further than to point out this reduction of psychologism\nto relativism, and, for the reasons given above, he makes no attempt\nto refute relativism. However, Husserl marshals a number of arguments\nagainst both Protagorean relativism and species relativism. If these\narguments were successful, then psychologism would be unmasked as a\nself-refuting doctrine. A number of critics have tried to show that\nthey are not successful.  \nAs concerns Husserl’s case against Protagorean relativism,\nHusserl himself admits that his arguments will only be convincing for\nthose philosophers who already accept that truth is absolute. Husserl\nis more ambitious with respect to species relativism. He believes that\nit can be shown that species relativism is a self-refuting doctrine\n(cf. Føllesdal 1958, 37–39; Sukale 1977,\n47–48). \nThe argument, according to which the species relativist misconstrues\nthe meaning of truth by allowing the same judgment to be both true and\nfalse, is clearly question-begging. Husserl’s argument boils\ndown to this: ‘It is contradictory to claim that truth is not\nabsolute because truth is absolute’ (Føllesdal 1958, 37).\nHusserl simply takes the absoluteness of truth as self-evident. He\nalso overlooks that, properly construed, the relativistic notion of\ntruth does not violate the Principle of Non-Contradiction. If truth is\ntaken as ‘truth-for-S’ (i.e. truth for a\nspecies), such that the hyphenisation is irreducible, then one and the\nsame judgment can be true-for-S1 and\nfalse-for-S2 without the Principle of\nNon-Contradiction being violated (Meiland 1977, 571). The further\nargument, according to which truth cannot be relative to species\nbecause truth is eternal, can obviously be rejected as a petitio\nprincipii as well. Finally, Husserl claims that if truth were\nrelative then so would be the existence of the world. Here too Husserl\ndoes little more than invoke self-evidence for his position. He takes\nit as self-evident that the existence of the world cannot be relative\nand he does not show that the opposite assumption is\nself-refuting. \nHusserl’s frequent reliance upon ‘apodictic\nself-evidence’ both as a weapon against the species relativist\nand as the source of insight into logical truths is itself beset with\ndifficulties. Husserl seems to think that apodictic self-evidence\ntakes the philosopher/logician beyond the realm of the factual, and\neven beyond the realm of psychology. But, as pointed out by Arne\nNaess, apodictic self-evidence cannot deliver on this promise:\n“… the assertion that he or any other has this evidence,\ndoes not belong to pure logic or any other pure or formal science. It\nbelongs to a factual science concerning the relation of logicians (and\nothers) to pure science. It is not necessary to conceive this to be\npsychology. It is enough … that it is a science of facts or\nmore generally, a science about the real rather than the ideal”\n(Naess 1954, 70). And thus, Naess concludes, the program of a pure\nlogic as a system of apodictic knowledge is “to be dismissed\n… As soon as a science is said to be science of or about\nsomething, there is a radical risk of error …” (Naess\n1954, 73). \nFinally, for both Frege and Husserl, Benno Erdmann is the chief\nculprit, that is, the main advocate of a form of psychologism that\nleads to species relativism. Interestingly enough, over the last\nthirty years, the critical re-evaluation of antipsychologism has even\nled to a partial rehabilitation of Erdmann’s\n‘psychologistic’ view of logic. As Jack Meiland (1976)\nconstrues Erdmann’s philosophy of logic, the psychological\ninterpretation of logical principles is meant to explain why we cannot\nconceive of radically different logical systems. The explanation is\nthat ‘logical laws express the conditions which govern our\nthinking in the sense of describing the limits of what we can\nthink’ (1976, 329). One of Husserl’s central objections to\nthis view is that logical principles like the Principle of\nNon-Contradiction can be denied by human individuals, and indeed have\nbeen denied, for example by Hegel. And thus Husserl concludes that\nlogical laws do not describe the limits of what is psychologically\nthinkable. However, Meiland suggests that Erdmann’s position is\nnot refuted by this argument. All Erdmann needs to reply is that while\nall human beings are able to utter the words ‘The Principle of\nNon-Contradiction is false’, they do not thereby think contrary\nto the principle or understand what they are saying (1976, 331).  \nThe other central Husserlian objection to Erdmann’s psychologism\nis that if logical laws were psychological laws, then they would be\nabout mental acts, judgments, ideas and other psychological entities.\nIn other words, logical laws should have real content. But obviously,\nlogical laws have no such real content, and therefore the\npsychological approach to logic must be false. Again, Meiland provides\na defense for Erdmann. While it is true that laws of logic do not\nrefer to human beings and their psychology, they might still be\ntrue-for human beings in virtue of their psychology. Put differently,\nwe \nMeiland explains this idea by drawing on the relation between gravity\nand the laws of planetary motion: \nDespite his spirited defence of Frege’s and Husserl’s\nfavourite whipping boy, Meiland believes that Erdmann’s\npsychologism must overcome some further difficulties before it can\nbecome fully respectable. The main problem is that Erdmann allows for\nthe possibility that the laws of logic could change, that there could\nbe a different logic, a logic that conflicts with our present one. Yet\nit is hard to see how Erdmann could be entitled to make such claim. On\nhis own premises, our present logic defines the limits of the\nthinkable. And this can only mean that a radically different logic\nmust be unthinkable for us. Put differently, Erdmann owes us an\nexplanation of how we could ever come to believe that a different\nlogic is possible (1976, 337). \nInterestingly enough, the challenge that Meiland directs at Erdmann\ncan be met. Remmel Nunn has suggested that Jerry Fodor’s\nfunctionalism provides us with a method for conceptualizing a\nsituation in which an entity is restricted to using one, and only one,\nset of formal principles even though a different set may be operative\nunder different conditions. According to functionalism humans can be\ncompared to computers. Humans come equipped with a built-in\n‘language of thought’, that is, a language that functions\nlike the machine table of a computer. Now a computer is not able to\ncompute formulae that are not among those in the vocabulary of its\nmachine table. But this does not mean that the machine table of any\ngiven computer is without alternatives, that ‘there cannot be\nsystems of logical laws which are inconsistent with those of a given\nautomaton’. Thus we can imagine that a given computer is so\ndesigned that it systematically makes (what we regard as) a formal\nmistake M. In this case, the machine would be unable to detect the\nmistake M, ‘for M would constitute one of the laws by which the\nautomaton detects errors’ (Nunn 1978, 347). \nIf we adopt some such analogy between humans and computers, Nunn\nsuggests, then we can make sense of the idea that our logic might not\nbe universal. If we think of our logic as being a central part of our\nlanguage of thought, and if we thus adopt the view that our logic is\npart of our machine table, then we must accept that our logic might\nnot be unique. True, we cannot state what a radically different logic\nwould look like. However, in order to vindicate Erdmann it is enough\nthat we can — by analogy — make sense of the possibility\nof such a logic (Nunn 1978, 347). \nThe prolonged debate in the German-speaking lands over psychologism\nwas eventually brought to an end by World War One. The war brought\nwith it an intellectual climate in which attacks on one’s\ncolleagues were regarded as utterly inappropriate. Moreover, it also\nlead to a clear division of labor between psychologists and\nphilosophers: while philosophers concentrated on the ideological task\nof celebrating the German ‘genius of war’, experimental\npsychology focused on the training and testing of soldiers. After the\nwar, both academic (anti-naturalistic) philosophy and (experimental)\npsychology had to cope with, and accommodate to, an intellectual\nenvironment that was hostile to science, rationality, and systematic\nknowledge. The project of a scientifically-minded philosophy with\nexperimental psychology as its central pillar quickly lost support.\nAnd hence the charge of psychologism could no longer play a central\nrole. \nEarly twentieth-century German-speaking philosophy exerted of course a\npowerful and lasting influence on philosophy in many other countries,\nnotably in the Anglo-American world. For a while Frege’s and\nHusserl’s arguments against antipsychologism even rose to the\nstatus of a paradigmatic achievement in philosophy: ‘There is\nprogress in philosophy after all!’ (Musgrave 1972, 606). As I\nhave indicated in the last section, this assessment of\nantipsychologism is now widely contested. \nOther countries of course had their own debates over the relation\nbetween psychology and philosophy. In the UK, for instance, George\nFrederick Stout and James Ward emphasised the philosophical\nsignificance of psychology; British Idealists like Francis Herbert\nBradley and Brand Blanshard were sympathetic to psychology even though\nthey denied its philosophical credentials; and realists like John Cook\nWilson, Bertrand Russell, Herbert Joseph, and Harold Arthur Prichard\ninsisted on a separation. For Prichard, psychology was not even a\n‘proper science’ (Passmore 1994). \nThroughout the twentieth century, and at the beginning of the\ntwenty-first century, psychology exerted and exerts a powerful pull on\nphilosophers who wish to put philosophy on the sure path of a science.\nQuine famously called for a return to psychologism in the 1960s. Such\ncalls have kept the psychologism accusation alive. Amongst the accused\none can find the names of Rudolf Carnap, Michael Dummett, Peter Geach,\nNelson Goodman, Thomas Kuhn, John McDowell, Karl Popper, Wilfrid\nSellars, and Ludwig Wittgenstein (Kusch 1995, 7).
