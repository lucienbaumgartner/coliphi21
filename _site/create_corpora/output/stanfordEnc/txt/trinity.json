Every term in this statement\n(God, exists, as or in, equally divine, Person) has been variously\nunderstood. The guiding principle has been the creedal declaration\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of the New Testament are\nconsubstantial (i.e. the same in substance or essence, Greek:\nhomoousios). Because this shared substance or essence is a\ndivine one, this is understood to imply that all three named\nindividuals are divine, and equally so. Yet the three in some sense\n“are” the one God of the Bible.\n\n\nAfter its formulation and imperial enforcement towards the end of the\nfourth century, this sort of Christian theology reigned more or less\nunchallenged. But before this, and again in post-Reformation\nmodernity, the origin, meaning, and justification of trinitarian\ndoctrine has been repeatedly disputed. These debates are discussed in\nsupplementary documents to this entry. One aspect of these debates\nconcerns the self-consistency of trinitarian theology. If there are\nthree who are equally divine, isn’t that to say there are at\nleast three gods? Yet the tradition asserts exactly one god. Is the\ntradition, then, incoherent, and so self-refuting? Since the revival\nof analytic philosophy of religion in the 1960s, many Christian\nphilosophers have pursued what is now called analytic theology, in\nwhich religious doctrines are given formulations which are precise,\nand it is hoped self-consistent and otherwise defensible. This article\nsurveys these recent “rational reconstructions” of the\nTrinity doctrine, which employ concepts from contemporary analytic\nmetaphysics, logic, and epistemology.\n\nOne-self theories assert the Trinity, despite initial appearances, to\ncontain exactly one self. \nA self is a being who is in principle capable of knowledge,\nintentional action, and interpersonal relationships. A deity is\ncommonly understood to be a sort of extraordinary self. In the Bible,\nthe deity Yahweh (a.k.a. “the LORD”) commands, forgives,\ncontrols history, predicts the future, occasionally appears in\nhumanoid form, enters into covenants with human beings, and sends\nprophets, whom he even allows to argue with him. More than a common\ndeity in a pantheon of deities, he is portrayed as being the one\ncreator of the cosmos, and as having uniquely great power, knowledge,\nand goodness. \nTrinitarians hold this revelation of the one God as a great self to\nhave been either supplemented or superseded by later revelation which\nshows the one God in some sense to be three “Persons.”\n(Greek: hypostaseis or prosopa, Latin:\npersonae) But if these divine Persons are selves, then the\nclaim is that there are three divine selves, which would seem to be\nthree gods. Some Trinity theories understand the Persons to be selves,\nand then try to show that the falsity of monotheism does not follow.\n(See section\n 2\n below.) But a rival approach is to explain that these three divine\nPersons are really ways the one divine self is, that is to say, modes\nof the one god. In current terms, one reduces all but one of the three\nor four apparent divine selves (Father, Son, Spirit, the triune God)\nto the remaining one. One of these four is the one god, and the others\nare his modes. Because the New Testament seems to portray the Son and\nSpirit as somehow subordinate to the one God, one-self Trinity\ntheories always either reduce Father, Son, and Spirit to modes of the\none, triune God, or reduce the Son and Spirit to modes of the Father,\nwho is supposed to be numerically identical to the one God. (See\nsection\n 1.8\n for views on which only the Holy Spirit is reduced to a mode of God,\nthat is, the Father.) \nBecause God in the Bible is portrayed as a great self, at the popular\nlevel of trinitarian Christianity one-self thinking has a firm hold.\nLiturgical statements, song lyrics, and sermons frequently use\ntrinitarian names (“Father”, “Son”,\n“Jesus”, “God”, etc.) as if they were\ninterchangeable, co-referring terms, referring directly or indirectly\n(via a mode) to one and the same divine self. \nBut, what is a “mode”? It is a “way a thing\nis”, but that might mean several things. A “mode of\nX” might be \nOne-self trinitarians often seem to have in mind the last of these.\n(E.g., The Son is the event of God’s relating to us as friend\nand savior. Or the Son is the event of God’s taking on flesh and\nliving and dying to reveal the Father to humankind. Or the Son is the\neternal event or state of affairs of God’s living in a son-like\nway.) If an event is (in the simplest case) a substance (thing) having\na property (or a relation) at a time, then the Son (etc.) will be\nidentified with God’s having a certain property, or being in a\ncertain relation, at a time (or timelessly). By a natural slide of\nthought and language, the Son (or Spirit) may just be thought of and\nspoken of as a certain divine property, rather than God’s having\nof it (e.g., God’s wisdom). \nModes may be essential to the thing or not; a mode may be something a\nthing could exist without, or something which it must always have so\nlong as it exists. (Or on another way to understand the\nessential/non-essential distinction, a mode may belong to a\nthing’s definition or not.) \nThere are three ways these modes of an eternal being may be temporally\nrelated to one another: maximally overlapping, non-overlapping, or\npartially overlapping. First, they may be eternally\nconcurrent—such that this being always, or timelessly, has all\nof them. Second, they may be strictly sequential (non-overlapping):\nfirst the being has only one, then only another, then only another.\nFinally, some of the modes may be had at the same times, partially\noverlapping in time. \nInfluential 20th century theologians Karl Barth (1886–1968) and\nKarl Rahner (1904–84) endorse one-self Trinity theories, and\nsuggest replacements for the term “Person”. They argue\nthat in modern times “person” has come to mean a self. But\nthree divine selves would be three gods. Hence, even if\n“Person” should be retained as traditional, its meaning in\nthe context of the Trinity should be expounded using phrases like\n“modes of being” (Barth) or “manners of\nsubsisting” (Rahner) (Ovey 2008, 203–13; Rahner 1997,\n42–5, 103–15). \nBarth’s own summary of his position is: \nAll of Barth’s capitalized pronouns here refer to one and the\nsame self, the self-revealing God, eternally existing in three ways.\nSimilarly, Rahner says that God \nSimilarly, theologian Alastair McGrath writes that \nAll three theologians are assuming that the three modes of God are all\nessential and maximally overlapping. \nMainstream Christian theologians nearly always reject\n“modalism”, meaning a one-self theory like that of\nSabellius (fl. 220), an obscure figure who was thought to teach that\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are sequential, non-essential modes,\nsomething like ways God interacts with his creation. Thus, in one\nepoch, God exists in the mode of Father, during the first century he\nexists as Son, and then after Christ’s resurrection and\nascension, he exists as Holy Spirit (Leftow 2004, 327; McGrath 2007,\n254–5; Pelikan 1971, 179). Sabellian modalism is usually\nrejected on the grounds that such modes are strictly sequential, or\nbecause they are not intrinsic features of God, or because they are\nintrinsic but not essential features of God. The first aspect of\nSabellian modalism conflicts with episodes in the New Testament where\nthe three appear simultaneously, such as the Baptism of Jesus in\nMatthew 3:16–7. The last two are widely held to be objectionable\nbecause it is held that a doctrine of the Trinity should tell us about\nhow God really is, not merely about how God appears, or because a\ntrinitarian doctrine should express (some of) God’s essence.\nSabellian and other ancient modalists are sometimes called\n“monarchians” because they upheld the sole monarchy of the\nFather, or “patripassians” for their (alleged) acceptance\nof the view that the Father (and not only the Son) suffered in the\nlife of the man Jesus. \nWhile Sabellian one-self theories were rejected for the reasons above,\nthese reasons don’t rule out all one-self Trinity theories, such\nas ones positing the Three as God’s modes in the sense of his\neternally having certain intrinsic and essential features. Sometimes\nthe Trinity doctrine is expounded by theologians as meaning just this,\nthe creedal formulas being interpreted as asserting that God\n(non-contingently) acts as Creator, Redeemer, and Comforter, or\ndescribing “God as transcendent abyss, God as particular yet\nunbounded intelligence, and God as the immanent creative energy of\nbeing… three distinct ways of being God”, with the named\nmodes being intrinsic and essential to God, and not mere ways that God\nappears (Ward 2002, 236; cf. Ward 2000, 90; Ward 2015). \nThe simplest sort of one-self theory affirms that God is, because\nomniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, the one divine self, and\neach Person of the Trinity just is that same self. The\n“Athanasian” creed (on which see section\n 5.3)\n seems to imply that each Person just is God, even while being\ndistinct from the other two Persons. Since the high middle ages\ntrinitarians have used a diagram of this sort to explain the teaching\nthat God is a Trinity. \nIf each occurrence of “is” here expresses numerical\nidentity, commonly expressed in modern logical notation as\n“=” then the chart illustrates these claims: \nBut the conjunction of these claims, which has been called\n“popular Latin trinitarianism”, is demonstrably incoherent\n(Tuggy 2003a, 171; Layman 2016, 138–9). Because the numerical\nidentity relation is defined as transitive and symmetrical, claims\n1–3 imply the denials of 4–6. If 1–6 are steps in an\nargument, that argument can continue thus: \nThis shows that 1–3 imply the denials of 4–6, namely, 8,\n10, and 12. Any Trinity doctrine which implies all of 1–6 is\nincoherent. To put the matter differently: it is self-evident that\nthings which are numerically identical to the same thing must also be\nnumerically identical to one another. Thus, if each Person just is\nGod, that collapses the Persons into one and the same thing. But then\na trinitarian must also say that the Persons are numerically distinct\nfrom one another. \nBut none of this is news to the Trinity theorists whose work is\nsurveyed in this entry. Each theory here is built with a view towards\nundermining the above argument. In other words, each theorist\ndiscussed here, with the exception of some mysterians (see section\n 4.2),\n denies that “the doctrine of the Trinity”, rightly\nunderstood, implies all of 1–6. \nBrian Leftow sets the agenda for his own one-self theory in an attack\non “social”, that is, multiple-self theories. (See\nsections\n 2\n and\n 3.1\n below.) In contrast to these, he asserts that \nLeftow characterizes his one-self Trinity theory as\n“Latin”, following the recent practice of contrasting\nWestern or Latin with Eastern or Greek or “social” Trinity\ntheories. Leftow considers his theory to be in the lineage of some\nprominent Latin-language theorists. (See the supplementary document on\nthe history of trinitarian doctrines,\n section 3.3.2,\n on Augustine, and\n section 4.1,\n on Thomas Aquinas.) In a later discussion Leftow adds that this\nTrinity theory needn’t commit to trope theory about\nproperties. Rather, whether or not properties are tropes,\n“…the Father’s having deity = [is numerically\nidentical to] the Son’s having deity. For both are at bottom\njust God’s having deity.” (Leftow 2007, 358) \nLeftow makes an extended analogy with time travel; just as a dancer\nmay repeatedly time travel back to the dance stage, resulting in a\nwhole chorus line of dancers, so God may eternally live his life in\nthree “streams” or “strands” (2004,\n312–23). Each Person-constituting “strand” of\nGod’s life is supposed to (in some sense) count as a\n“complete” life (although for any one of the three,\nthere’s more to God’s life than it) (2004, 312). Just as\nthe many stages of the time-traveling dancer’s life are united\ninto stages of her by their being causally connected in the right way,\nso too, analogously, the lives of each of the three Persons count as\nbeing the “strands of” the life of God, because of the\nmysterious but somehow causal inter-trinitarian relations (the Father\ngenerating the Son, and the Father and the Son spirating the Spirit)\n(313–4, cf. 321–2, Leftow 2012a, 313). \nTime-travel does not require that entities are four-dimensional\n(2012b, 337). If a single dancer, then, time travels to the past to\ndance with herself, this does not amount to one temporal part of her\ndancing with a different temporal part of her. If that were so,\nneither dancer would be identical to the (whole, temporally extended)\nwoman. But Leftow supposes that both would be identical to her, and so\nwould not be merely her temporal parts. He holds that if time travel\nis possible, a self may have multiple instances or iterations at a\ntime. His theory is that the Trinity is like this, subtracting out the\ntime dimension. God, in timeless eternity, lives out three lives, or\nwe might say exists in three aspects. In one he’s Father, in\nanother Son, and in another the Holy Spirit. But they are all one\nself, one God, as it were three times repeated or multiplied. \nLeftow argues that his theory isn’t any undesirable form of\n“modalism” (i.e. a heretical one-self theory)\nbecause \nLeftow wants to show what is wrong with the following argument (2004,\n305–6; cf. 2007, 359): \nCreedal orthodoxy requires 1–3 and 5, yet 1–3 imply the\nunorthodox 4, and 1, 2 and 5 imply the unorthodox (and necessarily\nfalse) statement 6. So what to do? Lines 1–4 seem perfectly\nclear, and the inference from 1–3 to 4 seems valid. So too does\nthe inference from 1, 2, and 5 to 6. Why should 6 be thought\nimpossible? The idea is that whatever its precise meaning,\n“generation” is some sort of causing or originating,\nsomething in principle nothing can do to itself. One would expect\nLeftow, as a one-self trinitarian, to deny 1 and 2, on the grounds\nthat neither Father nor Son are identical to the one self which is\nGod, but rather, each is a mode of God. But Leftow instead argues that\npremises 1 and 2 are unclear, and that depending on how they are\nunderstood, the argument will either be sound but not heretical, or\nunsound because it is invalid, 4 not following from 1–3, and 6\nnot following from 1, 2, and 5. \nThe argument seems straightforward so long as we read\n“Father” and “Son” as merely singular\nreferring terms. But Leftow asserts that they are also definite\ndescriptions “which may be temporally rigid or non-rigid”\n(Leftow 2012b, 334–5). A temporally rigid term refers to a being\nat all parts of its temporal career. Thus, if “the president of\nthe United States” is temporally rigid, then in the year 2013 we\nmay truly say that “The president of the United States lived in\nIndonesia”, not of course, while he was president, but it is\ntrue of the man who was president in 2013, that in his past, he lived\nin Indonesia. If the description “president of the United\nStates” (used in 2013) is not temporally rigid, then it\nrefers to Barack Obama only in the presidential phase of his life, and\nso the sentence above would be false. \n“The Father”, then, is a disguised description, something\nlike “the God who is in some life unbegotten” (2012b, 335)\n(For “the Son” we would substitute “begotten”\nfor the last word.) Because the “=” sign can have a\ntemporally non-rigid description on one or both sides of it, then\nthere can be “temporary identities”, that is, identity\nstatements which are true only at some times but not others. Leftow\ngives as an example the sentence “that infant = Lincoln”;\nthis is true when Lincoln is an infant but false when he has grown up.\nSuch identity statements can only be true or false relative to times,\nor to something time-like (2004, 324). If the terms\n“Father” and “Son” are temporally rigid, or at\nleast like such a term in that each applies to God at all portions of\nhis life (which isn’t temporally ordered), then 4 does\nfollow from 1–3. But 4, Leftow argues, is theologically\ninnocuous, as it means something like “the God who is in some\nlife the Father is also the God who is in some life the Son”\n(2012b, 335). This is “compatible with the lives, and so the\nPersons, remaining distinct,” seemingly, distinct instances of\nGod (each of which is identical to God), and Leftow accepts 1–4\nas sound only if 4 means this (ibid.). \nIf the terms “Father” and “Son” are temporally\nnon–rigid, or at least like such a term in\nthat each applies to God relative to some one portion of his life but\nnot relative to the others, then the argument is unsound. Relative to\nthe Father-strand of God’s life, 1 will be true but 2 will be\nfalse. Relative to the Son-strand, 2 will be true, but 1 will be\nfalse. 3 and 5 will be true relative to any strand, but in any case,\nwe will not be able to establish either 4 or 6. \nLeftow’s theory crucially depends on a concept of\nmodes–intrinsic, essential, eternal ways God is, that is, lives\nor life-strands. But he does not identify the\n“persons” of the Trinity with these modes. Rather, he\nasserts that the modes somehow constitute, cause, or give rise to each\nPerson (2007, 373–5). Like theories that reduce these\nPersons to mere modes of a self, Leftow’s theory has it\nthat what may appear to be three selves actually turn out to be one\nself, God. But they, all (apparently) three of them, just are\n(are numerically, absolutely identical to) that one self, that is, God\nthrice over or thrice repeated. \nSome philosophers object that Leftow’s time-travel analogy is\nunhelpful because time-travel is impossible (Hasker 2009, 158).\nSimilarly, one may object that Leftow is trying to illuminate the\nobscure (the Trinity) by the equally or more obscure (the alleged\npossibility of time travel, and timeless analogues to it). If\nLeftow’s one-self theory is intended as a literal interpretation\nof trinitarian language, a “rational reconstruction”\n(Tuggy 2011a), this would be problematic; but if he means it merely as\nan apologetic defense (i.e. we can’t rule out that the Trinity\nmeans this, and this can’t be proven incoherent) then the fact\nthat some intellectuals believe in the possibility of time travel\nsupports his case. \nOne may wonder whether Leftow’s life stream theory is really\ntrinitarian. Do not his Persons really, so to speak, collapse\ninto one, since each is numerically identical to God? Isn’t this\nmodalism, rather than trinitarianism? (McCall 2003, 428) Again, one\nmay worry that Leftow’s concept of God being\n“repeated” or having multiple instances or iterations is\neither incoherent or unintelligible. And how can such Persons be fully\nGod or fully divine when they exist because of something which is more\nfundamental, God’s life-strands? (Byerly 2017, 81) \nWilliam Hasker objects that assuming Leftow’s theory, \nIn reply, Leftow argues that if we accept the coherence of time travel\nstories, we should not be bothered by the prospect of “one\nperson at one point in his life begging the same person at another\npoint” (2012a, 321). About the cry of abandonment on the cross,\nLeftow urges that the New Testament reveals a Christ who (although\ndivine and so omniscient) did not have full access to his knowledge,\nspecifically knowledge of his relation to the Father, and so Christ\ncould not have meant what Hasker said above. Instead, he “would\nhave been using the Son’s ‘myself’ and\n’I,’ which… pick out only the Son” (2012a,\n322). \nHasker also objects that Leftow’s one–self theory\ncollapses the interpersonal relationships of the members of the\nTrinity into God’s relating to himself, and suggests that in\nLeftow’s view, God would enjoy self–love, but not\nother–love, and so would not be perfect (2009, 161–2,\n2012a, 331). (On this sort of argument see sections\n 2.3\n and\n 2.5\n below.) Leftow replies that the self–love in question would be\n“relevantly like love of someone else” and so, presumably,\nof equal value (2012b, 339). \nDoes the theory imply “patripassianism”, the traditionally\nrejected view that the Father suffers? (After all, the Son suffers,\nand both he and the Father are identical to God.) Leftow argues that\nnothing heretical follows; if his analysis is right “then\nclaiming that the Father is on the Cross is like claiming that The\nNewborn [sic] is eligible to join the AARP [an organization for\nretirees]”, that is, true but misleading (2012b, 336). \nRecent metaphysicians have discussed the possibility of a simple\n(partless) object which is nonetheless spatially extended, occupying\nregions of space, but without having parts that occupy the\nsub-regions. Martin Pickup (2016) makes an analogy between these and\nthe idea of a triune God, inspiring his own “Latin”\naccount. Motivated by skepticism about any three-self theory, and\ntaking the “Athanasian” creed as a starting point, he\nunderstands the claims that each Person “is God” as\nasserting the numerical identity of God with that Person. While God is\nlike an extended simple, the relationships between the Persons is\n“analogous to the relationships between the spatial regions that\nan extended simple occupies” (418). \nTo expound the theory Pickup uses the terminology of a “person\nspace”, an imagined realm of all possible persons, which is just\n“an abstraction of the facts about possible personhood”\n(422). A point within person space is “a representation of a\ngroup of properties that are jointly necessary and sufficient for\nbeing a certain possible person” (423). This is supposed to help\nus “see the conceptual space between being a certain person and\nbeing a certain entity” (422, n. 18). Pickup gives some\nnon–theological examples to motivate the idea that one thing may\noccupy multiple points of person space: the fictional example of Dr.\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde, and humans suffering from Dissociative Identity\nDisorders (420–1). \nThe prima facie trinitarian claims which generate a contradiction are\nas follows, where each “is” means numerical (absolute,\nnon-relative) identity. \nIf the three Persons are numerically distinct (4–6), then it\ncan’t be that all of them are numerically identical to some\none God. (1–3) Pickup proposes to understand these using person\nspace concepts. Using p1, p2, and p3 for different points in person\nspace, the points which correspond to being, respectively, the Father,\nSon, and Spirit, claims 1–3 are read as: \nThese claims entail the 1–3 we started with, understood as\nclaims of numerical identity. But this method of interpretation\ntransforms 4–6, which become: \nIn other words, “4. The Father is not the Son” is not\nunderstood as asserting the numerical distinctness of the Father and\nthe Son, but rather, as asserting the distinction of the\nFather’s person space from the Son’s person space. (And\nsimilarly with 5, 6.) The point of all of this is that the six\ninterpreted claims seem to be coherent, such that possibly, all of\nthem are true. Notably, this account accepts what we can call\n“Person-collapse”, the implication of 1-3 that the Father\njust is the Son, the Father just is the Spirit, and the Son just is\nthe Spirit. (In other words, those are numerically identical.) Thus,\nunlike many Trinity theories, this one is arguably compatible with a\ndoctrine of divine simplicity. \nPickup defends this account from several objections. Against the\nobjection that this is a heretical modalism, Pickup argues that it\ncan’t be, since here God’s being three Persons is a\nfundamental metaphysical fact, not a derivative fact. Further, each\nPerson is a real person, as real as any human person (426–7).\nStill, one may think the account denies the reality of the Persons.\nPickup clarifies that they are not so many distinct realities, but\nrather each just is God. Nor are they parts of God. When this theory\ncountenances the “distinctness of the Persons” it is not\nimplying the numerical distinctness of the Persons, but only the\ndistinctness of the person spaces they occupy (p1, p2, and p3). But as\nexplained above, person spaces are not understood to be real entities\n(435). \nSecond, it can be objected that catholic tradition demands the\nnumerical distinctness of the Persons. Pickup denies that it does,\nsince it aims to avoid tritheism and affirms that each just is God\n(427). \nThird, Person-collapse entails claims any trinitarian should deny,\nincluding that the Father just is the Son, and that the Spirit is\nthree Persons. (Being numerically the same with God, since God is\nthree Persons, the Holy Spirit will be three Persons.) Pickup concedes\nthat at first glance such claims “sound bad”, but replies\nthat any “Latin” account of the Trinity will as such have\nto accept such claims (428). \nFourth, it is self-evident that if any x and any y are numerically\nidentical, it follows that x and y can’t ever differ. But\narguably any account of the Trinity must allow that the Persons differ\nat least in respect of origin, so that only the Son is begotten, only\nthe Spirit proceeds, and only the Father begets the Son. \nIn reply, Pickup argues that metaphysicians who accept the possibility\nof extended simples also accept that such “can be heterogeneous:\nthat they can have different properties at the different locations at\nwhich they exist” (429). Metaphysicians differ in how they try\nto show that this is possible (432–4). But according to Pickup,\nit is plausible that there are “fundamental distributional\nproperties”. An example of a distributional property is an\nobject being polka-dotted, which requires that it is one color some\nplaces and another color in other places. What is controversial is\nthat such properties can be fundamental, that they can belong to the\nbasic metaphysical structure of reality, rather than being explained\nas no more than various smaller items having non-distributional\nproperties (430). Thus, we should not think that an extended simple\nwhich is heterogeneous both has and lacks a property, being F and not\nbeing F. Rather, we should think that it has a single distributional\nproperty of being F at some of its locations and not being F at\nothers. If, for instance, an extended simple could be colored, it\nmight be polka-dotted, where this is understood as a fundamental\nproperty, rather than, for instance, black in some spots and not-black\nin others. Thus, we avoid saying that one and the same object at a\nsingle time is and is not black (429–31). \nApplied to the Trinity , Pickup suggests that what at first look like\ndifferent properties (generating the Son, being generated, and being\nspirated) really amount to a single distributional property of God,\nwhich he calls “generation”. This is the property of\ngenerating the Son at p1, being generated at p2, and being spirated at\np3. This is not a matter of God being different at different person\nspaces; rather, at each space God has the distributional property\ncalled “generation” (431). In this way, the theory does\nnot deny the indiscernibility of identicals, the principle that if any\nx and any y are numerically identical, then they can’t ever\ndiffer. The persons of the Trinity, on this account, never do differ,\nalthough it may seem that way at first glance. \nAn objection to this is that the Father’s generation of the Son\nimplies that the Father is logically or causally prior to the Son, and\na distributional property can’t account for this. Pickup\nsuggests in reply that perhaps instead it is p1 which is prior to p2,\nor perhaps God’s occupying p1 is prior to his occupying p2\n(432). \nFinally, it can be objected that necessarily, any person just is a\ncertain entity, and that even if this is false, still, it seems that\nnecessarily persons and entities can’t be separated, so that if\nanything is one person it must be one entity as well (436). In reply,\nPickup denies that such claims are true, and suggests that\nconceptually, it seems that one may count persons and beings\ndifferently, even in merely human cases like the fictional Jekyll and\nHyde, which he takes to be an instance of one entity that is two\npersons (436, 420). Pickup also argues that it is a virtue of this\naccount that it doesn’t specify what it takes to be a person\n(436). \nOne may object that the suggested paraphrase or interpretation of the\nstatements that no Person is either of the others seems to change the\nsubject from divine Persons to imaginary “person spaces”.\nAgain, the cost of denying the numerical distinctness of the Persons\nmay be too high for many trinitarians to accept. And it would seem\nthat trinitarians are committed to many differences between the\nPersons other than the properties or relations relating to origin. The\nSon died, but the Father did not. The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus\nat his baptism, but the Father and Son did not. The Father at\nJesus’s baptism said “This is my beloved Son”, but\nthe Son and Spirit did not. It is not clear that all of these seeming\ndifferences can be understood as really involving fundamental\ndistributional properties of God. \nAny one-self theory is hard to square with the New Testament’s\ntheme of the interpersonal relationship between Father and Son.\n(Layman 2016, 129–30; McCall 2010, 87–8, 2014c,\n117–27; Plantinga 1989, 23–7) Any one-self theory is also\nhard to square with the Son’s role as mediator between God and\nhumankind (Tuggy and Date 2020, 122–3). These teachings arguably\nassume the Son to be a self, not a mere mode of a self, and to be a\ndifferent self than his Father. Theories such as Ward’s (section\n 1.3\n above), which make the Son a mere mode, make him something less than\na self, whereas others (see section\n 1.6)\n make him a self, but the same self as his Father. Either way, the Son\nseems not to be qualified either to mediate between God and humankind,\nor to be a friend of the one he calls “Father”. \nAgain, some traditional incarnation theories seems to assume that the\neternal Son who becomes incarnate (who enters into a hypostatic union\nwith a complete human nature) is the same self as the historical man\nJesus of Nazareth. But no mere mode could be the same self as\nanything, and the New Testament seems to teach that this man was sent\nby another self, God. \nSome one–self theories run into trouble about God’s\nrelation to the cosmos. If God exists necessarily and is essentially\nthe creator and the redeemer of created beings in need of salvation,\nthis implies it is not possible for there to be no creation, or for\nthere to be no fallen creatures; God could not have avoided creating\nbeings in need of redemption. One-self trinitarians may get around\nthis by more carefully specifying the properties in question: not\ncreator but creator of anything else there might be,\nand not redeemer but redeemer of any creatures in need of\nsalvation there might be and which he should want to save. \nSome ancient Christians, most 17th-19th century unitarians,\npresent-day “biblical unitarians”, and some modern\nsubordinationists such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses hold the Holy\nSpirit to be a mode of God—God’s power, presence, or\naction in the world. (See the supplementary document on\n unitarianism.)\n Not implying modalism about the Son, this position is harder to\nrefute on New Testament grounds, although mainstream theologians and\nsome subordinationist unitarians reject it as inconsistent with New\nTestament language from which we should infer that the Holy Spirit is\na self (Clarke 1738, 147). Modalists about the Spirit counter with\nother biblical language which suggests that the “Spirit of\nGod” or “Holy Spirit” refers to either God himself,\na mode of God (e.g., his power), or an effect of a mode of God (e.g.,\nsupernatural human abilities such as healing). (See Burnap 1845,\n226–52; Lardner 1793, 79–174; Wilson 1846, 325–32.)\nThis exegetical dispute is difficult, as all natural languages allow\npersons to be described in mode-terms (“Hillary is Bill’s\nstrength.”) and modes to be described in language which\nliterally applies only to persons. (“God’s wisdom told him\nnot to create beer-sap trees.”) \nOne-self Trinity theories are motivated in part by the concern that if\nthere are three divine selves, this implies that there are three gods.\nThree-self theories, in various ways, deny this implication. They hold\nthe Persons of the Trinity to be selves (as defined above, section\n 1.1).\n A major motivation here is that the New Testament writings seem to\nassume that the Father and Son (and, some also argue, the Holy Spirit)\nare different selves (e.g. Layman 2016, 131–2). \nWhy can’t multiple divine selves be one and the same god? It\nwould seem that by being the same god, they must be numerically the\nsame entity; “they” are really one, and so\n“they” can’t differ in any way (that is, this one\nentity can’t differ from itself). But then, they (really: it)\ncan’t be different divine selves. \nRelative identity theorists think there is some mistake in this\nreasoning, so that things may be different somethings yet the same\nsomething else. They hold that the above reasoning falsely assumes\nsomething about numerical sameness. They hold that numerical sameness,\nor identity, either can be or always is relative to a kind or\nconcept. \nRelative identity theorists are concerned to rebut this sort of\nargument: \nIf each occurrence of “is” here is interpreted as identity\n(“absolute” or non-relative identity), then this argument\nis indisputably valid. Things identical to the same thing must also be\nidentical to one another. The relative identity trinitarian argues\nthat one should read the “is” in 1 and 2 as meaning\n“is the same being as” and the “is” in 3 as\nmeaning “is the same divine Person as”. Doing this,\none may say that the argument is invalid, having true premises\nbut a false conclusion.  \nThese theorists reject another response to the above argument, which\nwould be to reject it is invalid because 1 and 2 mean that each is a\nmode of God (see section\n 1),\n and while these claims are true, they don’t imply 3,\nsince the Father and the Son are two different modes. Against\nthis, the theories of this section assume that the three Persons of\nthe Trinity are three selves (Rea 2009, 406. 419; van Inwagen 1995,\n229–31).  \nFollowing Rea (2003) we divide relative identity trinitarian theories\ninto the pure and the impure. Pure theories accept (1) either that\nthere is no such relation as absolute identity or that such statements\nare definable in terms of relative-identity relations, and (2) that\ntrinitarian statements of sameness and difference (e.g. the Father is\nGod, the Father is not the Son) are to be analyzed as involving\nrelative and not absolute identity relations, whereas the impure\ntheories accept only (2), allowing that statements about absolute\nidentity (e.g. a = b) may be both intelligible and true, against (1).\n(434–8) \nPeter Geach (1972, 1973, 1980) argues that it is meaningless to ask\nwhether or not some a and b are “the same”; rather,\nsameness is relative to a sortal concept. Thus, while it is senseless\nto ask whether or not Paul and Saul are identical, we can ask whether\nor not Paul and Saul are the same human, same person, same apostle,\nsame animal, etc. The doctrine of the Trinity, then, is construed as\nthe claim that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the same\nGod, but are not the same Person. They are\n“God-identical but Person-distinct” (Rea 2003, 432). \nAs Joseph Jedwab explains, traditional Trinity language and\ncommitments arguably lead naturally to a relative identity\naccount. \nGeach’s approach to the Trinity is developed by Martinich (1978,\n1979) and Cain (1989). Jedwab (2015) criticizes Cain’s version\nas implying philosophical, theological and christological\ndifficulties. Cain (2016) defends his more Geachian approach. \nPure relative identity trinitarianism depends on the controversial\nclaim that there’s no such relation as (non-sortal-relative,\nabsolute) identity. Most philosophers hold, to the contrary, that the\nidentity relation and its logic are well-understood; such are\nexpounded in recent logic text-books, and philosophers frequently\nargue in ways that assume there is such a relation as identity (Baber\n2015, 165; Layman 2016, 141). One might turn to a weaker relative\nidentity doctrine; outside the context of the Trinity, philosopher\nNicholas Griffin (1977; cf. Rea 2003, 435–6) has argued that\nwhile there are identity relations, they are not basic, but\nmust be understood in terms of relative identity relations. On either\nview, relative identity relations are fundamental. \nIt has been objected to Geach’s claim about the senselessness of\nasking if a and b are (non-relatively) “the same”\nthat, \nRea objects that relative identity theory presupposes some sort of\nmetaphysical anti-realism, the controversial doctrine that there is no\nrealm of real objects which exists independently of human thought\n(2003, 435–6). Baber replies that such worries are misguided, as\nthe only aim of relative identity theory should be to show a way in\nwhich the Trinity might be coherent (2015, 170). \nTrenton Merricks objects that if a and b “are the same F”,\nthis implies that a is an F, that b is an F, and that a and b are\n(absolutely, non-relatively) identical. But this widely accepted\nanalysis is precisely what relative identity trinitarians deny. This\nleads to the objection that relative-identity trinitarian claims are\nunintelligible (that is, we have no grasp of what they mean). If\nsomeone asserts that Fluffy and Spike are “the same dog”\nand denies that they’re both dogs which are one and the same, we\nhave no idea what this person is asserting. Similarly with the claim\nthat Father and Son are “the same God” but are not\nidentical (Merricks 2006, 301–5, 321; cf. Tuggy 2003a,\n173–4, Layman 2016, 141–2). \nBaber (2015) replies that if the sortal dog is\n“dominant”, meaning that for any sortal F, if x and y are\nthe same dog, they will also be the same F, then the claim that Fluffy\nand Spike are the same dog but not absolutely identical is\nintelligible. After all, we can understand that the claim implies that\nFluffy and Spike are the same animal, the same pet, and so on (167).\nThe relative identity trinitarian, Baber says, must hold that\n“Being does not dominate [i.e. imply sameness with\nrespect to] Person but rather that Person dominates\nBeing”. However, there’s no easy way to prove\nthis, and dominance claims are theory-relative (ibid.). But\nsuch a claim will just be a part of the relative identity\ntheorist’s Trinity theory (169). \nOne may also object to either sort of relative identity account being\nthe historical doctrine on the grounds that only those conversant in\nthe logic of the last 120 years or so have ever had a concept of\nrelative identity. But this may be disputed; Anscombe and Geach (1961,\n118) argue that Aquinas should be interpreted along these lines,\nRichard Cartwright (1987, 193) claims to find the idea of\nrelative identity in the works of Anselm and in the Eleventh Council\nof Toledo (675 C.E.), and Jeffrey Brower (2006) finds a similar\naccount in the works of Peter Abelard. (On Aquinas, see the\nsupplementary document on the history of trinitarian doctrines\n section 4.)\n Christopher Hughes Conn (2019) argues that Anselm was the first to\nconsciously develop a Trinity theory involving relative identity. \nPeter van Inwagen (1995, 2003) tries to show that there is a set of\npropositions representing a possibly orthodox interpretation of the\n“Athanasian” creed (see section\n 5.3)\n which is demonstrably self-consistent, refuting claims that the\nTrinity doctrine is obviously self-contradictory. He formulates a\ntrinitarian doctrine using a concept of relative identity, without\nemploying the concept of absolute identity or presupposing that there\nis or isn’t such a thing (1995, 241). Specifically, he proves\nthat the following eight claims (understood as involving relative and\nnever absolute identity, the names being read as descriptions)\ndon’t imply a contradiction in his system of relative identity\nlogic. \nVan Inwagen neither endorses this Trinity theory, nor presumes to\npronounce it orthodox, and he admits that it does little to reduce the\nmysteriousness of the traditional language. \nIt may be objected, as to the preceding theory, that van\nInwagen’s relative identity trinitarianism is unintelligible.\nMerricks argues that this problem is more acute for van Inwagen than\nfor Geach, as the former declines to adopt Geach’s claim that\nall assertions of identity, in all domains of discourse, and in\neveryday life, are sortal-relative (Merricks 2006, 302–4). \nMichael Rea (2003) objects that by remaining neutral on the issue of\nidentity, van Inwagen’s theory allows that the three Persons are\n(absolutely) non-identical, in which case “it is hard to see\nwhat it could possibly mean to say that they are the same\nbeing” (Rea 2003, 441). It seems that any things which are\nnon-identical are not the same being. Thus, van Inwagen must\nassume that there is absolute identity, and deny that this relation\nholds between the Persons. Thus, van Inwagen has not demonstrated the\nconsistency of (this version of) trinitarianism. Further, the theory\ndoesn’t rule out polytheism, as it doesn’t deny that there\nare non-identical divine beings. In sum, the impure relative identity\ntrinitarian owes us a plausible and orthodox metaphysical story about\nhow non-identical beings may nonetheless be “one God”, and\nvan Inwagen hasn’t done this, staying as he has in the realm of\nlogic (Rea 2003, 441–2). \nIn a later discussion, van Inwagen goes farther, claiming that\ntrinitarian doctrine is inconsistent “if the standard logic of\nidentity is correct”, and denying there is any “relation\nthat is both universally reflexive [i.e., everything bears the\nrelation to itself] and forces indiscernibility [i.e. things standing\nin the relation can’t differ]” (2003, 92). Thus,\nthere’s no such relation as classical or absolute identity, but\nthere are instead only various relative identity relations\n(92–3). In so doing he moves to a “pure” relative\nidentity approach to the Trinity, as described in section\n 2.1.1. \nMany philosophers would object that whatever reason there is to\nbelieve in the Trinity, it is more obvious that there’s\nsuch a relation as identity, that the indiscernibility of identicals\nis true, and that we do successfully use singular referring terms. \nVlastimil Vohánka (2013) argues that van Inwagen has done\nnothing to show the logical possibility of any Trinity theory. Just\nbecause a set of claims can’t be proven inconsistent in van\nInwagen’s relative identity logic, it doesn’t follow that\nsuch claims don’t imply a contradiction, or that it is\nmetaphysically possible that all the claims are true. At one point van\nInwagen tells a short non-theological story whose claims, when\ntranslated into his relative identity logic, have the same forms as\nthe Trinity propositions. The story, he argues, is clearly not\nself-contradictory; thus, he concludes, neither are the Trinity\npropositions, since they have the same logical forms. In response,\nVohánka concocts a short non-theological story whose claims\ntranslate into claims of the same form in relative identity logic, and\nyet are clearly logically impossible (207–11). He\nconcludes that “there’s no ground for thinking that formal\nconsistency in [relative identity logic] guarantees logical\npossibility”, and that “sharing a form in [relative\nidentity logic] with a logically possible proposition does not\nguarantee logical possibility” (211–2). \nAnother theory claims to possess the sort of metaphysical story van\nInwagen’s theory lacks. Based on the concept of constitution,\nRea and Brower develop a three-self Trinity theory according to which\neach of the divine Persons is non-identical to the others, as well as\nto God, but is nonetheless “numerically the same” as all\nof them (Brower and Rea 2005a; Rea 2009, 2011). They employ an analogy\nbetween the Christian God and material objects. When we look at a\nbronze statue of Athena, we should say that we’re viewing one\nmaterial object. Yet, we can distinguish the lump of bronze from the\nstatue. These cannot be identical, as they differ (e.g., the lump\ncould, but the statue couldn’t survive being smashed flat). We\nshould say that the lump and statue stand in a relation of\n“accidental sameness”. This means that they needn’t\nbe, but in fact are “numerically the same” without being\nidentical. While they are numerically one physical object, they are\ntwo hylomorphic compounds, that is, two compounds of form and matter,\nsharing their matter. This, they hold, is a plausible solution to the\nproblem of material constitution (Rea 1995). \nSimilarly, the Persons of the Trinity are so many selves constituted\nby the same stuff (or something analogous to a stuff). These selves,\nlike the lump and statue, are numerically the same without being\nidentical, but they don’t stand in a relation of\naccidental sameness, as they could not fail to be related in\nthis way. Father, Son, and Spirit are three quasi form-matter\ncompounds. The forms are properties like “being the Father,\nbeing the Son, and being the Spirit; or perhaps being Unbegotten,\nbeing Begotten and Proceeding” (Rea 2009, 419). The single\nsubject of those properties is “something that plays the role of\nmatter,” which Rea calls “the divine essence” or\n“the divine nature” (Brower and Rea 2005a, 68; Rea 2009,\n420). Whereas in the earlier discussion “the divine essence [is]\nnot… an individual thing in its own right” (Brower and\nRea 2005a, 68; cf. Craig 2005, 79), in a later piece, Rea holds the\ndivine nature to be a substance (i.e. an entity, an individual being),\nand moreover “numerically the same” substance as each of\nthe three. Thus, it isn’t a fourth substance; nor is it a fourth\ndivine Person, as it isn’t, like each of the three, a\nform-(quasi-)matter compound, but only something analogous to a lump\nof matter, something which constitutes each of the Three (Rea 2009,\n420; Rea 2011, Section 6). Rea adds that this divine nature is a\nfundamental power which is sharable and multiply locatable. He\ndoesn’t say whether it is either universal or particular,\nsaying, “I am unsure whether I buy into the universal/particular\ndistinction” (Rea 2011, Section 6). All properties, in his view,\nare powers, and vice versa. Thus, this divine nature is both a power\nand a property, and it plays a role like that of matter in the\nTrinity. \nThis three-self theory may be illustrated as follows (Tuggy 2013a,\n134). \nThere would seem to be seven realities here, none of which is\n(absolutely) identical to any of the others. Four of them are\nproperties: the divine nature (d), being unbegotten (u), being\nbegotten (b), and proceeding (p). Three are hylomorphic (form-matter)\ncompounds: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (f, s, h)–each with the\nproperty d playing the role of matter within it, and each having its\nown additional property (respectively: u, b, and p) playing the role\nof form within it. Each of these compounds is a divine self. The ovals\ncan be taken to represent the three hylomorphs (form-matter compounds)\nor the three hylomorphic compounding relations which obtain among the\nseven realities posited. Three of these seven (f, s, h) are to be\ncounted as one god, because they are hylomorphs with only one divine\nnature (d) between them. Thus, of the seven items, three are\nproperties (u, b, p), three are substances which are hylomorphic\ncompounds (f, s, h), and one is both a property and a substance, but a\nsimple substance, not a compound one (d). \nBrower and Rea argue that their theory stands a better chance of being\northodox than its competitors, and point out that a part of their\nmotivation is that leading medieval trinitarians such as Augustine,\nAnselm, and Aquinas say things which seem to require a concept of\nnumerical sameness without identity. (See Marenbon 2007, Brower 2005,\nand the supplementary document on the history of Trinity theories,\nsections\n 3.3.2,\n on Augustine, and\n 4.1,\n on Thomas Aquinas.) \nIn contrast to other relative-identity theories, this theory seems\nwell-motivated, for its authors can point to something outside\ntrinitarian theology which requires the controversial concept of\nnumerical sameness without identity. This concept, they can argue, was\nnot concocted solely to acquit the trinitarian of inconsistency. But\nthis strength is also its weakness, for on the level of metaphysics,\nmuch hostility to the theory is due to the fact that philosophers are\nheavily divided on the reality, nature, and metaphysical utility of\nconstitution. Thus, some philosophers deny that a metaphysics of\nmaterial objects should involve constitution, since strictly speaking\nthere are no statues or pillars, for these apparent objects should be\nunderstood as mere modes of the particles that compose them. Arguably,\ntruths about statues and pillars supervene on truths about\narrangements of particles (Byerly 2019, 82–3). \nThis Constitution theory has been criticized as underdeveloped,\nunclear in its aims, unintelligible, incompatible with self-evident\ntruths, unorthodox relative to Roman Catholicism, polytheistic and not\nmonotheistic, not truly trinitarian, involving too many divine\nindividuals (primary substances), out of step with the broad\nhistorical catholic tradition, implying that the Persons of the\nTrinity can’t simultaneously differ in non-modal and\nnon-temporal properties, not a theological improvement over simpler\nrelative identity approaches, and as wrongly implying that terms like\n“God” are systematically ambiguous (Craig 2005; Hasker\n2010b; Hughes 2009; Layman 2016; Leftow 2018; Pruss 2009, Tuggy\n2013a). \nScott Williams has constructed a similar theory, which he calls a\n“Latin Social” account. In common with Leftow’s\n“Latin” theory and Hasker’s “Social”\ntheory (see sections\n 1.5,\n 2.4), Williams says that there is one “concrete\ninstance or trope of the divine nature” which is a constituent\nof each Person. Each Person is also constituted by an incommunicable\nattribute, begetting (Father), being begotten (Son), and being\nspirated (Spirit) (Williams 2017, 324). He understands each Person to\nbe “an incommunicable existence of an intellectual nature”\n(326). In his view any person is a person “ontologically and\nexplanatorily prior to any cognitive acts of volitions that\nthat person in question has or might have” (Williams\n2017, 327; cf. 2013, 2019). And for him, the Persons are persons. Each\nPerson is essentially numerically the same essence as the one divine\nessence, while being a numerically different Person from the other two\nPersons. Thus, the account involves irreducible relations of\nkind-relative numerical sameness. But the divine Persons are not\n(absolutely) numerically identical to one another, and each is not\n(absolutely) numerically identical to the divine essence. This divine\nessence is like an Aristotelian first substance in that it exists on\nits own (not in another) and in being a concrete particular, but\nunlike first substances it is communicable, in other words, it can be\nshared by non-identical things, the divine Persons (Williams 2017,\n326). The term “God” can refer to any of the Persons, or\nto the divine essence. The term “Trinity” is a\nplural-referring term which refers to the plurality of the divine\nPersons (Williams 2013, 85). (See section\n 5.1.) \nWilliams considers it an axiom of trinitarian theorizing that\n“the divine persons are necessarily unified or necessarily agree\nregarding all things” (2017, 321). Some rival theories try to\naccount for this “necessary agreement thesis” by showing\nhow, allegedly, the Persons would have to come up with some policy\nwhich would prevent disagreement. Williams finds such claims\n“philosophically unsatisfying”, and instead argues that\nthe three Persons can never disagree because they have numerically one\nwill, one power of choosing (322). Unlike any other three persons, the\nPersons of the Trinity, because they share one divine nature, share\none set of powers, and so any exercise of any divine power belongs to\neach of the three. In this case, Williams analyzes thinking as\nproducing and using a token sentence in what we might call divine\nmentalese. Building on work by philosopher John Perry on indexical\nterms like “I”, Williams points out that a single token of\na sentence in English may be used by different agents, and may thus\nhave multiple meanings. For example, \nSimilarly, if divine Persons think using a language-like divine\nmentalese, then one token of this may be used by different Persons and\nhave a different significance for each. The idea is that a person\nrelates to a proposition (the content of his thought) by means of a\ntoken sentence which he produces and uses to think. But these mental\nacts, given that the Persons share one set of powers, must be shared\nby all three of them. Yet, the thoughts thereby thought will differ.\nFor example, \nThis account denies what some philosophers assume to be obvious, that\n“distinct and incommunicable intellectual acts and volitional\nacts are necessary conditions for being a person” (339).\nWilliams rejects this as an ungrounded modern assumption. While it\nemploys recent thinking about indexical terms and other matters,\nWilliams considers this account to fit well with historical\ntheologians such as Gregory of Nyssa, Henry of Ghent, and John Duns\nScotus (345). That the persons share all mental acts does not imply\nthat they share one mind or that there is one consciousness in the\nTrinity. Rather, the access consciousness, experiential consciousness,\nand introspective consciousness of each Person may differ (2020,\nSection 3). \nA New Testament reader might question the assumption that the Persons\nof the Trinity can’t disagree, given the temptation of the Son\n(but not of the Father) and an occasion when the Son asked the Father\nto be excused from a difficult trial (Matthew 4:1–11; James\n1:13; Mark 14:36). \nIn a response, William Hasker objects that it seems that sometimes\nhuman beings can think without using any language. Why, then, should\nwe suppose divine Persons to think only by means of mental token\nsentences? Perhaps they can just relate directly to propositions (the\ncontents of their thoughts). Worse, Williams posits that this divine\nmental language is ambiguous, but Hasker says, “we would\nnaturally expect a divine language of thought to be very precise\nindeed, perhaps maximally so” (Hasker 2018b, 364). He also\nobjects that the theory wrongly counts mental acts. Hasker imagines\nthat the Holy Spirit intends to become incarnate on some other planet,\nand that before this Incarnation or the Incarnation of the Son, the\nthree of them together produce the mental token “I shall become\nincarnate”. Hasker urges that this seems to be two uses of the\nsame mental sentence, one by the Son and the other by the Spirit.\n“To be aware of a proposition is precisely to perform a mental\nact,” and here the Son is aware of one, but the Spirit is aware\nof another (365). But this clashes with Williams’s claim that\nthere is but one mental power shared by the three. \nWilliams replies that divine mental tokens are needed “to\nexplain why a divine person’s mental act is directed at (among\nall possible propositions) the proposition it is directed at”\n(Williams 2020, 115). Williams denies that ambiguity is always an\nimperfection of a language, and urges that there is nothing\nobjectionable about divine Persons using mental tokens that can be\nused to express various propositions (110–1). About\nHasker’s allegation that the theory mis-counts the mental acts\nof the Persons, Williams says that to the contrary, we should see but\none mental act here, though we should keep in mind the Persons’\nbackground knowledge about who will become incarnate, which provides\nthe contexts relative to which the one token mental sentence means\ndifferent things. Moreover, “Why posit several mental acts here,\nwhen one mental act will do the same explanatory work?” Finally,\nWilliams clarifies that the necessary sharing of divine acts does not\napply to “internal divine productions”, such as the\nFather’s eternal generation of the Son (111–4,\n115–6). \nAnother relative identity theory by Justin Mooney (2020) depends on an\nentirely different metaphysical account to show how multiple persons\nmay each be the same being. Metaphysician Ned Markosian proposes a\nthought experiment in which a man dies and is mummified, and then a\nlong time later the mummy’s parts are re-arranged into a living\nwoman who has an utterly different psychology than the dead man. The\npoint is that the woman is the same object as the man but is not the\nsame person as the man, because the instances of personhood in his\nlife aren’t part of the same episode of personhood (3–4).\nMooney applies Markosian’s ideas about “identity under a\nsortal” to the Trinity. On this account, “God is a single,\ndivine substance that is simultaneously or atemporally participating\nin three distinct episodes of personhood–those of the Father,\nSon, and Spirit” (5). Thus, each Person just is God, but none is\nthe same Person as any other divine Person. The account may be\nillustrated by modifying the traditional Trinity shield: \nOn this theory, being different Persons doesn’t imply being\nnumerically distinct. \nOne may worry that such Persons must be one and the same Person since\nthey have but one substance between them, but Mooney answers that they\nare individuated by their causal relationships, following Swinburne\n(1994) (5). In addition, following Effingham, he says that they are\nnot one and the same Person because they aren’t linked by\nimmanent causal relations. (5–6) These are “those causal\nlinks an entity bears to itself from one time to another whereby the\nway it is earlier on causes how it is later on” (Effingham\n2015, 35). Following Moreland and Craig (2017), Mooney adds that\nGod possesses three mental faculties, each had by one of the Persons\n(6). Finally, adapting ideas from Swinburne (1994), he says that \nHe remains neutral on whether this process is either temporal or\nnecessary (ibid.). \nUnlike other relative identity theories, this account, like some\none-self theories, affirms the absolute identity of each Person with\nGod; each is the same thing or being or primary substance, God (7).\nThis generates a concern that the account may count as a heretical\nmodalism. Mooney replies that “if Markosian’s episodic\nview of personal identity is right, the model is not modalist”\n(ibid.). The reason is that on this account there are three\nepisodes of personhood, which implies that there are three Persons,\neven though there is one being which is the component thing in each\nepisode, a single subject of the properties that are involved in being\na Person. \nEven though the account has it that these three are different Persons,\nstill, it identifies each with God, which entails their identity with\none another; being the same thing as God, they must be the same thing\nas each other. Given this, it would seem that they can’t differ\nin any way, e.g. the Son becomes incarnate but the Father does not\n(7). Mooney replies that the Trinity is mysterious, and that probably\na sentence like “The Son became incarnate but the Father\ndidn’t” might be understood as not requiring a\nsimultaneous or eternal difference between the being that is the Son\nand the one which is the Father. In Markosian’s thought\nexperiment, one would think that person-names would track with the\ndifferent stages in the career of the one object, so that, say,\n“Alice” would refer to the thing only in its latest\nstages, and “Bob” would apply to it only in its pre-mummy\ncareer. Thus, names like “Father” and “Son”\nshould refer to God only in one or the other of God’s\nPerson-episodes. Mooney suggests, then, that “The Son became\nincarnate but the Father didn’t” will be true if and only\nif the Son but not the Father is the same person as someone who became\nincarnate, that is, God becomes incarnate in the Person-episode\nassociated with the name “Son” but not in the one\nassociated with “Father” (8). \nThis, Mooney argues, shows why when counting objects, we should count\nby (absolute) identity, while when counting persons we should count by\nthe relation same-person. In the Trinity, then, we count one thing but\nthree Persons; the Persons are the same thing but different persons\n(9). The account also solves his “problem of Triunity”\n(2018), which is that as normally analyzed, these three statements\ncan’t all be true, and yet arguably a trinitarian is committed\nto all three of them: \nThe solution is that even though “strictly speaking, the Son is\ntriune” since the Son just is God and God is triune, the meaning\nof 3 is that “the Son is not the same person as anyone\nwho is triune”, which is both true and consistent with 1 and 2\n(10). Mooney adds that the property being triune should not be\nconfused with the property of being the same Person as someone who is\ntriune; only the first, in his view, is an essential divine attribute\n(10–1). \nMooney argues that this account also solves problems relating to\ndivine processions and aseity. The Son, being God, must have the\nproperty of aseity. But Mooney suggests that the Father’s\ngeneration of the Son doesn’t explain the Son’s existence\n(which would rule out the Son's aseity), but only the Son’s\nbeing a person distinct from the Father (12). \nThe viability of this theory rests on a particular metaphysics of\npersonhood. One might think, contra Markosian and Mooney, that the\nwoman in the story is one being, the mummy is a second being\n(even though composed of many or all of the same parts), and the man\nwho follows is a third being. Similarly, one may wonder whether\nnumerically distinct Persons can each be numerically the same as one\ngod. The theory implies the falsity of the principle that for any x\nand y, if they are different Fs, then x is an F, y is an F, and\nx≠y. One might also question the theory’s way of dealing with\napparent differences between the (numerically identical) Persons; any\ndifferences of the form the “the Father is F but the Son is not\nF” get analyzed as meaning “the Father is the same Person\nas someone who is F and the Son is not the same Person as someone who\nis F”. Does the original claim really mean what the analysis\nsays? \nSome influential 20th-century theologians interpreted the Trinity as\ncontaining just one self. (See section\n 1.3\n above.) In the second half of the century, many theologians reacted\nagainst one-self theories, criticizing them as modalist or as somehow\nnear-modalist. This period also saw the wide and often uncritical\nadoption of a paradigm for classifying Trinity theories which derives\nfrom 19th c. French Catholic theologian Théodore de\nRégnon (Barnes 1995). On this paradigm, Western or Latin or\nAugustinian theories are contrasted with Eastern or Greek or\nCappadocian theories, and the difference between the camps is said to\nbe merely one of emphases or “starting points”. The\nWestern theories, it is said, emphasize or “start with”\nGod’s oneness, and try to show how God is also three, whereas\nthe Eastern theories emphasize or “start with” God’s\nthreeness, and try to show how God is also one. The two are thought to\nemphasize, respectively, psychological or social analogies for\nunderstanding the Trinity, and so the latter is often called\n“social” trinitarianism. But this paradigm has been\ncriticized as confused, unhelpful, and simply not accurate to the\nhistory of Trinitarian theology (Cross 2002, 2009; Holmes 2012; McCall\n2003). \nAlthough the language of Latin vs. “social” Trinity\ntheories has been adopted by many analytic philosophers (e.g. Leftow\n1999; Hasker 2010c; Tuggy 2003a), these have interpreted the different\ntheories as logically inconsistent (i.e. such that both\ncan’t be true), and not merely as differing in style, emphasis,\nor sequence. \nSome 20th century theological sources, accepting the de Régnon\nparadigm, proceed to blame the Western tradition for\n“overemphasizing the oneness” of God, and recommend that\nbalance may be restored by looking to the Eastern tradition. A number\nof concerns characterize theologians in this 20th and 21st century\nmovement of “social” trinitarianism: \n(For surveys of this literature see Kärkkäinen 2007; Olson\nand Hall 2002, 95–115; Peters 1993, 103–45.) These writers\nare often unclear about what Trinity theory they’re endorsing.\nThe views seem to range from tritheism, to the idea that the Trinity\nis an event, to something that differs only slightly, or only in\nemphasis, from pro-Nicene or one-self theories (see section\n 1\n and section\n 3.3\n of the supplementary document on the history of trinitarian\ndoctrines). Merricks observes that some views advertised as\n“social trinitarianism” make it “sound equivalent to\nthe thesis that the Doctrine of the Trinity is true but modalism is\nfalse” (Merricks 2006, 306). However, a number of Christian\nphilosophers, and some theologians employing the methods of analytic\nphilosophy, have started with this literature and then proceeded to\ndevelop relatively clear three-self Trinity theories, which are\nsurveyed here. They differ in how they attempt to secure monotheism\n(Leftow 1999). There are many such Trinity theories, and it is not\nclear that all the options have yet been explored (Davidson 2016). \nA problem for any three-self Trinity theory is that numerically three\nselves are, it would seem, numerically three things. And according to\na theory of essences or natures, a thing which has or which is an\ninstance of an essence or nature is thereby a thing of a certain kind.\nAll Trinity theories include the Nicene claim that the Persons of the\nTrinity have between them but one essence or nature, the divine one.\nBut it would seem that by definition a thing with the divine essence\nis a god, and so three such things would be three gods. \nSome three-self theories in effect concede that they imply tritheism\n(three things, each of which has properties sufficient for being a\ngod), but argue that surely a correct Trinity theory can’t avoid\nthe right type of tritheism, and can avoid any undesirable tritheism,\nsuch as ones involving unequal divinity of the Persons, Persons which\nare in some sense independent, or Persons who are in principle\nseparable (McCall 2010, 2014c; Plantinga 1988, 1989; Yandell 2010,\n2015). \nRichard Swinburne has long developed and defended a type of three-self\nTrinity theory which in the eyes of most critics seems to be “a\nfairly straightforward form of tritheism” (Alston 1997, 55. See\nalso Clark 1996; Davidson 2016; Feser 1997; Howard-Snyder 2015a;\nMoreland and Craig 2017; Rea 2006; van Inwagen and Howard-Snyder 1998;\nvan Inwagen 2003, 88; Vohánka 2014, 56). In a series of\narticles and books Swinburne’s views have changed in significant\nways (Swinburne 1988, 1994, 2008, 2018), but this entry focuses on his\nlatest work on the Trinity. \nSwinburne aims to build his theory on widespread traditional\nagreements between most catholic theologians since at least\nthe fourth and fifth centuries (Swinburne 2018, Section 1). The\nPersons of the Trinity are three beings, each a self which satisfies\nBoethius’s definition of a “person” as “an\nindividual substance (substantia) of a rational nature”\n(421). Each is divine in that each has all the divine attributes.\n“A divine person is naturally understood as one who is\nessentially eternally omnipotent and exists (in some sense)\n’necessarily’” (427). He argues that omnipotence\nentails perfect goodness and omniscience. While all three of the\nPersons exist necessarily (inevitably), the Father does this\nindependently while the Son and Spirit exist of necessity dependently,\nbecause necessarily, the Father exists, and his existence implies that\nhe causes them (437, n. 14). These actions of the Father are\ninevitable and not voluntary, but they are via the Father’s will\n(425, 428). This causing is traditionally described as the eternal\ngeneration of the Son by the Father, and the eternal proceeding of the\nSpirit from the Father, or from the Father and the Son. For Swinburne,\nthe Son is “caused by the Father alone” while the Spirit\nis “caused by the Father and/or through the Son” (429).\nThe theory then is committed to one of these two models of the divine\nprocessions. \nSwinburne has constructed a couple versions of an argument which\npurports to show why, if there is at least one divine being or Person,\nthere must be exactly three, with the second and third being caused\nultimately by the first. In other words, given that it is possible\nthat there be a divine Person, it is metaphysically impossible that\nthere be only one, and it is metaphysically necessary that there be\nexactly three. Most trinitarians have assumed that such an argument is\nneither possible nor desirable, as the Trinity can be known only by\ndivine revelation. Against this, Swinburne says that “even if\nyou regard the New Testament as an infallible source of doctrine, you\ncannot derive from it a doctrine of the Trinity”, because when\nit comes to passages about the Spirit, \nOne may wonder if there could be two omnipotent beings; there have\nbeen arguments from theism (at least one god) to monotheism (exactly\none god) based on the idea that it’d be impossible for there to\nbe more than one who is omnipotent. (See the Monotheism entry, section\n 5.)\n Suppose that one omnipotent being willed a certain object to move and\nsimultaneously another omnipotent being willed that it should remain\nin place. It would seem that whether the object moves or stays in\nplace, one of the being’s wills is thwarted, so that, contrary\nto our stipulation, one of them fails to be omnipotent. Swinburne\nargues that such conflicts of will are impossible given the\nomniscience, perfect goodness, and causal relations of the omnipotent\nbeings. In his view, in causing the Son and Spirit, the Father must\n“lay down the rules determining who has the right to do which\nactions; and the other members of the Trinity would recognize his\nright, as the source of their being to lay them down” (428). \nInspired by similar arguments given by Richard of St. Victor,\nSwinburne argues that a divine Person must be perfect in love. But \nThus, if there is one divine Person, there must also be another.\nFurther, there must be a third, for \nWhat stops this process of deity-proliferation from careening into\nfour, seventy-four, or four million divine Persons? Swinburne replies\nthat it is not better to cause four (or more) divine Persons\nthan it is to cause three, since \nIn sum, divinity implies “perfect love”, which implies\nexactly three divine Persons. \nLebens and Tuggy (2019) object that such arguments trade on the\nambiguity of “perfect love”. Divinity, by implying moral\nperfection, implies the character trait of being perfectly loving. But\nsomeone may have this and yet not be in the sort of interpersonal\nrelationship that Swinburne describes as “perfect love”.\n(See also Tuggy 2015.) Using familial analogies, Brian Leftow\nchallenges Swinburne’s claim that the three would lack an\noverriding reason to produce a fourth, noting that “Cooperating\nwith two to love yet another is a greater ‘balancing act’\nthan cooperating with one to love yet another” (1999, 241). \nTuggy (2004) objects that if a three-self theory like\nSwinburne’s were true, it would seem that one or more members of\nthe Trinity have wrongfully deceived us by leading us to falsely\nbelieve that there is only one divine self. He also argues that the\nNew Testament writings assume that “God” and “the\nFather of Jesus” (in all but a few cases) co-refer, reflecting\nthe assumption that God and the Father are numerically the same. (See\nalso Tuggy 2014, 2019.) Denying this last claim, he argues, amounts to\nan uncharitable and unreasonable attribution of a serious confusion to\nthe New Testament writers and (if they’re to be believed) to\nJesus as well. These arguments are rebutted by William Hasker (2009)\nand the argument is continued in Hasker 2011, Tuggy 2011b, and Tuggy\n2014. \nBut as mentioned at the outset, the most common objection to\nSwinburne’s Trinity theory is that it is tritheism and not\nmonotheism. Looking, for instance, at this account of divine\nprocessions, a reader wonders why this doesn’t amount to one god\neternally causing a second god, and with that second god eternally\ncausing a third god. To assuage such concerns, Swinburne argues that\non his model of the Trinity, it is natural to say that there is\n“one God”. Swinburne observes that the Greek\ntheos (and equally the Latin deus) may be used\neither as a name, a singular referring term picking out a certain\nindividual thing, or as a predicate, a descriptive word equivalent in\nmeaning to “divine”, which might in principle be applied\nto more than one thing. Then he observes, \nThe suggestion is that the tradition is somewhat confused, but that\ncharitably, we should think its talk of “one God” should\nbe understood as referring to the Trinity. (However, see the opening\nline of the Nicene creed.) What sort of thing is this Trinity? It is\nnot a divine Person, and is not a thing (person or not) with the\ndivine essence. Rather, it is a thing of which the three divine beings\n(selves, persons) are proper parts (425). Despite this complex entity\nnot having the divine essence (and so, not being a god), Swinburne\nsometimes refers to it as “God himself” (424). He argues\nthat these three beings can’t help but cooperate, and so agrees\nwith the traditional claim that apart from the aforementioned eternal\ncausings of one another, any act of one Person of the Trinity is an\nact of all three Persons (425). In sum, “This common\nomnipotence, omniscience, and perfect goodness in the community of\naction makes it that case that in a natural sense there is one\nGod” (428). That is, given the three divine beings described\nabove, it is “natural”, when it comes to the name-like use\nof the word “God,” to apply the term to that thing which\nis the whole consisting of those three Persons. But it remains that\nthere are three things here each of which is divine, and that this\nwhole is not itself divine; it’s hard to see why this is\nmonotheism and not tritheism. \nBrian Leftow objects that in Swinburne’s account God is not\nitself divine. Nor does it makes sense to worship it, as it is not the\nsort of thing which can be aware of our addressing it. Further, the\nissue of monotheism isn’t the issue of how unified the divine\nbeings are, but rather of how many there are. \nMoreover, Swinburne’s theory entails serious inequalities of\npower among the Three, jeopardizes the personhood of each, and carries\nthe serious price of allowing (contrary to most theists) that a divine\nbeing may be created, and the possibility of more than one divine\nbeing (Leftow 1999, 236–40). \nDaniel Howard-Snyder (2016) argues that Swinburne is committed to\ndescriptive polytheism, normative polytheism, and cultic polytheism,\nand so is a “polytheist par excellence”. He also\nargues that Swinburne’s account of the Trinity is\nunorthodox. \nDaniel Spencer (2019) argues that the several factors which Swinburne\nand others appeal to in order to lend some sort of unity to the three\npersons are obviously inadequate to show how they amount to one God\nand not three gods. At most, we get three divine beings who in some\nways resemble a god. Spencer observes that sometimes Swinburne simply\naccepts tritheism, as when he says that there are three divine\nindividuals or beings (Spencer 2019, 192, 198 n. 2; Swinburne 1994,\n170, 179). In his first treatment of the subject Swinburne talks of\n“three Gods” (Swinburne 1988, 234). In later writings he\ndoesn’t use that phrase, but his conception of the Persons is\nsubstantially the same. Spencer observes that in principle, making the\nPersons proper parts of a whole which is the only God might do the\ntrick (195–6), and Swinburne does suggest that there is a\npart-whole relationship between the Persons and God; however, for\nSwinburne the whole is not a god. \nPerhaps the most sympathetic voice in the literature is William Hasker\n(2013, Chapter 18), but in the end he agrees that Swinburne has not\ndone enough to unify the Persons. (Hasker 2013b, Chapters 25–8,\n2018, 5–7; Swinburne 2014) \nWilliam Hasker (2013b) has constructed what is arguably the most\ndeveloped three-self theory of the Trinity. As with Swinburne, his\nthoughts have developed over decades (Tuggy 2013b), but this entry\nwill focus on his recent publications. For Hasker, following\nPlantinga, the Persons of the Trinity are “distinct centers of\nknowledge, will, love, and action…persons in some full\nsense of the term” (22; cf. Chapter 24). Hasker argues that such\na view is widespread in ancient sources, including Gregory of Nyssa\nand Augustine (Chapters 4–5, 9). While we can’t reasonably\nretain the ancient doctrine of divine simplicity (Chapter 7, 2016,\n2018a, 7–8, 18–9), we ought to uphold as many of the\ntraditional claims as possible, for we should assume divine guidance\nof theological development, even though “the Church’s\ndoctrine of the Trinity is not as such to be found in the New\nTestament” (8). The “fathers” of the late fourth\ncentury should be seen as “the giants on whose shoulders we need\nto stand” (10). In the second part of his book (Chapters\n11–20) Hasker interacts with a number of Trinity theories,\nattempting to salvage whatever is correct in them for use in his own\nthree-self theory; he incorporates ideas particularly from Leftow,\nCraig, Rea, and Swinburne. \nFor Hasker, the Persons of the Trinity are three divine selves\n(Chapters 22–5). Against a modern Protestant trend, Hasker\ninsists that a doctrine of processions must be retained, arguing that\nit enjoys “significant support” from scripture (217), and\nhe points out the awkwardness accepting “the main results of the\n[ancient] trinitarian controversy” while thinking that this\n“developmental process…had at its heart a fundamentally\nwrong assumption”, that is, that the Son and Spirit exist\nbecause of the Father (222–3). \nHasker spends several chapters (25–8) addressing the question:\n“in virtue of what do the three persons constitute one\nGod?” (203). The three enjoy some sort of unity of will and\nfellowship, and they are united in that the second and third exist and\nhave the divine nature because of the first, but such factors\ndon’t, by themselves, imply that they somehow amount to a single\ngod. Hasker holds that a crucial factor is the idea of their shared\ndivine nature as a concrete property or trope. Following Craig,\nsometimes Hasker characterizes this concrete divine nature as a divine\nmind or soul. He argues that for all we know, it is possible for one\nsuch trope of divinity “to support simultaneously three distinct\nlives” which belong to the Persons (228). He argues that this\npossibility is indirectly supported by split-brain and\nmultiple-personality phenomena in human psychology. He takes these to\nshow that “It is possible for a single concrete human\nnature–a single trope of humanness–to support\nsimultaneously two or more centers of consciousness” (236). \nThis supporting or sustaining relation, Hasker says, may optionally be\nspecified to involve the divine nature constituting each Person\n(Chapter 28). \nConstitution is defined here as asymmetric, so none of the Persons\nalso constitutes the divine nature (245). In a later discussion, he\nseems to make constitution central to the theory (Hasker 2018a).\nAdapting work on the metaphysics of material constitution by Lynne\nRudder Baker, Hasker offers this definition: \nSuppose x has F as its primary kind, and y has G as its primary kind.\nThen x constitutes y just in case \nApplying this doctrine of non-material constitution to the Trinity, to\nsay that the divine nature constitutes the Father is to say that those\nhave all their parts in common and that the nature is in\ndivine-Person-favorable circumstances. For a thing of the type\n“divine mind/soul or concrete nature” to be in\n“divine trinitarian Person”-favorable circumstances means\nthat there is a divine trinitarian Person which has all his parts in\ncommon with the first thing, and that it is conceivable that the first\nthing exists even though there is nothing of the type “divine\ntrinitarian Person” that has all its parts in common with it.\nHasker clarifies that in his view all the entities mentioned here are\nsimple (lacking in proper parts), so each will be what metaphysicians\ncall an improper part of one another, satisfying condition i. He also\nclarifies that the conceptual possibility in condition iv does not\nimply metaphysical possibility; Hasker denies that this is\nmetaphysically possible: the divine nature exists but no divine Person\nexists (18). He adds that \nPresumably, the divine-Person-favorable circumstances which the divine\nnature is in, is support of these life-streams. \nHasker argues that the “grammar” of the Trinity forbids a\nChristian from saying things like “three gods” based on\nthere being three Persons each of which is divine (2013b, 247). Again,\nalthough “God” in the New Testament nearly always refers\nto the Father, one can’t infer that the Father and God are\nnumerically one (248). With a nod to a mereological account of the\nPersons and God, he says that “Each Person is wholly God, but\neach Person is not the whole of God” (250; cf. 257). Hasker also\nargues, plausibly, that the “Athanasian” creed can be read\nas non-paradoxical if we realize that it is laying down rules about\nwhat must be said and what must not be said (250–4). \nIn the end, as with Swinburne, the Trinity which is called\n“God” is not literally a god, as it is not divine. But\nHasker suggests that \nIn an attack on theories of divine simplicity, in which he sets aside\nconsiderations of God as Trinity, Hasker objects that if God is\nsimple, God is “dehumanized” in that God must lack certain\nqualities which Christians should think God literally shares with\nhuman beings, such as caring for and being responsive to his\ncreatures, and being able to either judge or forgive them (2016,\nSection 5). But while none of those qualities implies being human,\neach arguably implies selfhood. Yet Hasker denies that God is\nliterally a self. \nBrian Leftow points out the oddness of ascribing a soul to God the\nTrinity. \nLeftow also objects that the sentence “God is the ultimate\nreality” seems to be true by definition. But on Hasker’s\ntheory, this soul (a.k.a. the divine nature), which is not God, would\nbe the ultimate reality, being the source of the Persons and so of God\n(the Trinity) (12). Again, Leftow objects that this theory is not\nmonotheistic; rather, the theory features three deities which we\ncan’t describe as such because there is one object (the divine\nnature/soul) which constitutes them (15). \nDaniel Howard-Snyder objects that Hasker’s talk of the nature\n“supporting” or “sustaining” the lives or\n“life-streams” of the Persons is unintelligible (2015b,\n108–10). He also argues that it is unclear quite what\nconstitutes the Persons, as in various places Hasker says that this is\nthe divine mind/soul, the concrete divine nature (a trope of\ndivinity), and a single mental substance–and these would appear\nto be different claims (110). Also, monotheism uncontroversially\nimplies that there is exactly one god. But Hasker forbids saying that\nany of the Persons is a god. And by definition being a god implies\nhaving the divine nature, and like others Hasker understands divinity\nto imply perfection in knowledge, power to intentionally act, and\nmoral goodness–thus, divinity implies being a self. This,\nHoward-Snyder says, is a necessary truth and one with which basically\nall Christians agree. But Hasker’s “God”, whether\nthis is a community or a composite object, is not a self, and so is\nnot literally divine. But then, we’ve run out of candidates for\nbeing the only god; if neither the Father, nor the Son, nor the Spirit\nis a god, then it would seem that for Hasker there is no god!\nAnticipating monotheism-related objections, Hasker lobs various\ncharges at Howard-Snyder (112–3), but in the end it seems that\nHasker’s view is just that “God” can be spoken of\nas if it were a self (114–5). Taking a term from recent\nphilosophy of mind, Howard-Snyder says that for Hasker God is a\n“zombie”, a merely apparent self which in fact lacks any\nconsciousness, any point of view, and any mentality (114). He\nconcludes that Hasker is not aiming for the sober metaphysical truth\nabout the Trinity but is instead settling for some sort of\n“as-ifery”. How, he asks, could it be more accurate to\ndescribe God as “omnipotent and omniscient” than it is to\ndescribe God as “powerless and ignorant” when on\nHasker’s account God is straightforwardly the latter? (115) \nHasker replies that his claim that the divine nature supports the\nlives of the Persons is no more unintelligible than is the claim that\n“my desktop computer supports word processing”; to support\nis to “maintain in being or in action; to keep up, keep\ngoing” (Hasker 2018a, 11). Nor should it worry us that we\ncan’t understand how this supporting works (12). \nThe Trinity monotheist says that even though there are three divine\nPersons, there is one God because there is one Trinity (Moreland and\nCraig 2017, 588; Craig 2006; Layman 1988, 2016). William Lane Craig\nhas defended the best known such theory. The aim is to go beyond mere\nanalogies, providing a literal model of how to understand traditional\ntrinitarian claims. \nCraig and Moreland offer Cerberus, the three-headed dog from Greek\nmythology as “an image of the Trinity among creatures”\n(592). The point of this fictional example is that Cerberus would be\none dog with three “centers of consciousness”. Though only\nparts of one dog, each head is literally canine. If we were to upgrade\nthe mental capacity of the three here, it would be one dog which is\nthree persons. And if we imagine that Cerberus survives\ndeath, in that case we can’t say that the three are one dog\nbecause they have one body. In fact, we’re now imagining one\n(canine) soul which supports three persons. Change canine to divine,\nand this is the model of the Trinity. (592–3) \nOnly the Trinity, on this theory, is an instance of the divine nature,\nas the divine nature includes the property of being triune. (See\nsection\n 5.1.) \nBeyond the Trinity “there are no other instances of the divine\nnature” (2017, 589). So if “being divine” means\n“being identical with a divinity” (i.e., being a thing\nwhich instantiates the nature divinity), then none of the Persons are\n“divine”. But the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each\n“divine” in that they are parts of the one God, somewhat\nas the bones of a cat are “feline”, or as the heads of\nCerberus are “canine” (592). \nBut the theory also makes the Persons “divine” in other\nways too. In a sense the theory divides the divine attributes between\nthe Persons and the Trinity. \nLike Swinburne (see section\n 2.3)\n Craig argues that it is impossible for God to be a single Person\nbecause “if God is perfectly loving by his very nature, he must\n[eternally] be giving himself in love to another” (593). And\nsince God is free not to create, but must be loving another,\n“the other to whom God’s love is necessarily directed must\nbe internal to God himself” (ibid.). For Craig this is\na plausibility argument rather than a strict proof, in support of the\nclaim that the concept of unipersonal God is incoherent. Unlike\nSwinburne, he does not seem to think that this argument is important\nto reasonable belief in the Trinity (Craig believes the Trinity can\nsomehow be derived from the Bible–on which see section 5.4), nor\ndoes Craig mount a philosophical argument for why there must be\nexactly three divine Persons. \nOne may object that this argument depends on an equivocation on the\nphrase “perfectly loving”. One who thinks that God is a\nperfect being must hold that God has the character trait of being\nperfectly loving, but this doesn’t seem to imply the action of\nperfectly loving (i.e. engaging in the best kind of loving\nrelationship with another) (Lebens and Tuggy 2019). \nDaniel Howard-Snyder (2003) offers numerous objections to\nCraig’s theory. First, it can’t avoid either polytheism or\ndifferent levels of divinity, either of which would make it\nunorthodox. The Cerberus analogy is criticized on the grounds that it\nwould not be one dog with three minds, but rather, three dogs with\noverlapping bodies. (This seems clear in the parallel case of human\nconjoined twins; everyone considers them to be siblings, two humans\nwith overlapping bodies, not a human with two heads.) While\nCraig’s theory upholds (with the creeds) one divine substance,\nby his own criteria each of the three Persons must be a substance as\nwell, and the account says that each Person is divine. Thus, the\ntheory implies polytheism (393–5). Here God is not a personal\nbeing, in the sense of being numerically identical with a certain\nself, even though it (God) has parts which are selves. Craig wants to\nsay, for example, that each of the three is all-knowing, and also that\nGod is all-knowing, in that God has parts which are all-knowing. But\nHoward-Snyder objects that, \nAccording to Trinity monotheism, a thing can exemplify the divine\nnature without itself being a self. Nor can divinity include\nproperties which require being a self, e.g., being all-knowing, being\nperfectly free. This, Howard-Snyder argues, is “an abysmally\nlow” view of the divine nature, since “If God is not a\nperson or agent, then God does not know anything, cannot act, cannot\nchoose, cannot be morally good, cannot be worthy of worship”\n(401). \nCraig replies to Howard-Snyder’s objection to the Cerberus\nanalogy that the claim that it represents three dogs is\n“astonishing”, as we all speak of two headed snakes,\nturtles and such (Craig 2003, 102). While on Trinity monotheism God\nisn’t identical to any personal being, it doesn’t follow\nthat God isn’t “personal”. He is personal in the\nsense of having personal parts. Further, the view that God isn’t\na self \nAs to the charge of polytheism, Craig accuses Howard-Snyder of\nconfusing monotheism with unitarianism (106), i.e. assuming that the\nexistence of exactly one god entails that there is exactly one divine\nself. Finally, Craig argues that the issue of whether or not the Three\ncount as parts of God is unimportant (107–13). Tuggy (2013b)\npresses some of Howard-Snyder’s objections, concluding that the\ntheory is either not monotheistic, or turns out to be a one-self\ntheory. \nStephen Layman (2016) has constructed a similar and arguably better\ndeveloped three-self Trinity theory. Motivated by the New Testament,\nLayman says that the three Persons of the Trinity are three selves\n(124–31). Each is “divine” in that he is a fitting\nobject of worship, and so is God the Trinity. God the Trinity is\nliterally a social entity, a concrete, primary substance which is\nstrongly analogous to a living thing, and which like a living thing is\na self-maintaining event (149–50). “Strictly speaking,\nonly the Trinity, the community of divine persons, is God, that is,\nruler of all” (148). Yet the Persons are “of one\nsubstance” in that “each belongs to the kind divine\nbeing”, where this means a person which is a part of a god\n(150–1, 165–6). \nOne may object that a social entity can’t be a god, as such a\nthing is merely an abstraction. Layman answers that social entities\nare concrete, not abstract, and can intentionally act (159–60).\nIntentionally acting requires having intentions, but social entities\nmay have these, even though they are not selves or even subjects of\nconsciousness. Social entities may have intentions because their parts\n(i.e. various selves) have them. As a fallback, Layman suggests the\nview that social entities may act even though they’re incapable\nof intentional action (159). Like Craig, Layman argues that the\nTrinity can be omnipotent, perfectly good, and omniscient because its\npersons are (160). Why then is the Trinity not a fourth divine person\n(see section\n 3.1)? \nBut doesn’t the Bible portray God as a self who speaks in the\nfirst-person? Layman concedes that the Old Testament does. But because\nthey believe in progressive divine revelation, Christians should read\nthe Old Testament as corrected by the New Testament. And in the New\nTestament arguably there are “three divine persons (conscious\nbeings)” (164). Old Testament passages where “God”\nspeaks first-person should be read as the Father speaking on behalf of\nthe Trinity (ibid.). \nThe account is not polytheism because only the Trinity is God, and\nbecause of the necessary unity of the three (160, 167). But\nisn’t “Every divine person is a god” true by\ndefinition? No, because “divine” can mean relating to a\ngod (without being a god), and in this common meaning the Persons of\nthis theory are “divine”. Similarly, a hand can be\n“human” without itself being a human being (165). \nHow can the Son and Spirit be fully divine if each is caused by the\nFather and so does not exist a se? Layman answers that\n“the objector’s intuition that divinity requires\naseity is not shared by those who drew up the [Nicene]\ncreed” (167). Further, “it seems to me that aseity is\nclearly not essential to divinity, that is, it is not essential for\nbeing worthy of worship” (168). The qualities of omnipotence,\nomniscience, eternality, perfect goodness, and necessary existence are\nsufficient to guarantee the worship-worthiness of the Persons\n(ibid.). \nLike Swinburne and Craig, Layman argues that a God who is a single\nself is impossible. While aware than a theist may understand God to be\n“perfectly loving” in the sense of having a perfect\ndisposition to love which doesn’t have to be actualized, Layman\nnonetheless asserts that \nThus, given that God must be perfect independently of creation,\n“a truly solitary person would not be divine, for it would not\nbe perfectly loving” (154). Additionally, Layman argues that it\nis “inconceivable” that a divine Person should flourish\nwithout loving another, and that surely only the love of finite selves\nwould not be enough (154–5). A solitary divine Person would be\n“an appropriate object of pity” (155). Again, Layman\nargues that the Bible suggests that a divine Person must have not only\nsplendor (exalted attributes) but also glory, “something at\nleast akin to fame–a kind of recognition, approval, or\nappreciation” which is conferred by another (156). A solitary\ndivine Person would be lacking this glory; but presumably a divine\nPerson must have glory. Thus, there couldn’t be just one divine\nperson (156–7). \nLayman is skeptical about philosophical arguments purporting to show\nwhy there must be exactly three divine Persons, but he think’s\nhe’s shown why there can’t be only one. The limit of\ndivine Persons to three, in his view, can only come from the Bible\n(157–8). \nTuggy (2015) objects to arguments that there can’t be a single\ndivine self based on divine happiness or flourishing, urging instead\nthat a divine self who exists and is perfect of himself would\nautomatically be well-off, happy, or flourishing despite lacking\ncountless important goods. It is too anthropomorphic, he argues, to\nsuppose that a god or a divine self, like a human, is a social animal\nwhich can’t flourish without interpersonal relationships. \nChristopher Hughes (2009) suggests a theory much like the Constitution\ntheory (section\n 2.1.2\n above) but without its controversial claim that there can be\nnumerical sameness without identity. On this picture, \nOn this theory, “The Father is God,” means that the Father\nhas God for his matter, or that the Father is “materiated\nby” God, and “The Father is the same God as the Son”\nmeans that these two are materiated by the same God\n(309–10). \nAn objection is that the one God of Christianity is not supposed to be\na portion of matter. Hughes replies that perhaps it is\northodox to say that God is a very unusual kind of matter (310). \nAlternately, Hughes suggests a retreat from matter terminology, and\nargues that Persons of the Trinity can’t bear the same relation\nthey bear to one another that each bears to God. That is, it\ncan’t be correct, for example, that Father and Son are\nconsubstantial, and that the Father and God are consubstantial. The\nreason is that for two things to be consubstantial is for there to be\nsomething which both are “substantiated” or\n“ensubstanced” by. They are consubstantial\nbecause they both bear this other relation to a third,\nsubstantiating thing. Thus, e.g. “The Father is God” means\n“The Father is (a person of the substance) God.” Thus,\neven though Father and Son are numerically two, still it can be true\nthat “There is just one (substance) God” (311). \nOn this alternate view, though, what does it mean to say that God is\nthe substance of a divine Person? Hughes suggests that the case is\nanalogous to material objects. A sweater and some wool thread are\n“co-materiate” in that both are “materiated”\nor “enmattered” by one portion of matter, though they are\nnumerically distinct (311; cf. 313). Hughes suggests it is an open\nquestion whether this is a different theory, or just a restatement of\nthe first “in more traditional theological terminology.”\nIt will be the latter “If we can stretch the notion of\n‘matter’ far enough to cover God, and stretch the notion\nof material substance (aka hylomorph) far enough to cover the divine\npersons” (312). Hughes ends on a negative mysterian note (see\nsection\n 4.1 below),\n claiming that it is an advantage of this last account that\nensubstancement is “a (very, though not entirely) mysterious\nrelation” (313). \nLeftow (2018) objects that this theory features four things which are\ndivine, which is at least one too many. Further, on this account God\nhas but the Persons lack the divine attribute of aseity, which makes\nthe Persons “at best only second-class deities” (10). \nEinar Bøhn (2011) argues that trinitarian problems of\nself-consistency vanish when one realizes that the Trinity “is\njust an ordinary case of one-many identity” (363). He takes from\nFrege the idea that number-properties are concept-relative. Thus, \n…conceptualizing the portion of reality that is God as the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we have conceptualized it as\nbeing three in number, but it is nonetheless the same portion of\nreality as what we might conceptualize as God, and hence as being one\nin number. (366) \nThere is no privileged way of conceptualizing [this portion of\nreality] in terms of which we can explain the other way. Both ways are\nequally legitimate. (369) \nA difficulty for this approach is that most philosophers don’t\nthink there can be one-many identity relations. Some think\nidentity is of necessity a one-one relation, although others\nallow there can be many-many identity; for instance, it may be that\nthe three men who committed the robbery are identical to the three men\nwho were convicted of the robbery. Those who believe identity can be\none-many typically do so because they accept the controversial thesis\nthat composition (the relation of parts to a whole they compose)\nshould be understood as identity. Although Bøhn does accept\nthat thesis (Bøhn 2014), he argues that this Trinity theory\nrelies only on our having “a primitive notion of plural\nidentity” (371), that is, a concept we understand without\nreference to any concept from mereological (parts and wholes) theory.\nFor example, we can recognize a certain human body to be identical to\na certain plurality of head, torso, two arms, and two legs. And we can\nrecognize that a pair of shoes is identical to a plurality of shoes\n(365). \nBøhn argues that orthodoxy, by the standards of either the New\nTestament or the “Athanasian” Creed (see section\n 5.3),\n requires that the Persons of the Trinity be distinct (i.e. no one is\nidentical to any other) but not that any is identical to the one God.\nRather, orthodoxy requires that the one God is identical to the Three\nconsidered as a plurality. Thus, e.g. “The Father is God”\nmust be read predicatively, that is, not as identifying the Father\nwith God, but rather as describing the Father as divine (364, 367 n.\n13). \nDoes this theory make God’s triunity dependent on human thought?\nAnd might the divine portion of reality equally well be conceived as\nseventeen? Bøhn replies, \nThus, it doesn’t follow that any conceptualization of this\nportion of reality is equally correct. While in this context he demurs\nfrom saying anything about concepts (372), it seems that Bøhn\nassumes in Fregean fashion that concepts are objective and not\nmind-dependent (Bøhn 2013, Section 1). \nJoseph Long (2019) objects that the theory is unorthodox because it\nrequires a type of thing which is divine and yet which is neither the\nTrinity nor any divine Person. Further, Bøhn’s talk of\n“portions of reality” is unintelligible. Finally,\northodoxy demands that the Persons of the Trinity “are one God\nregardless of our conceptual scheme”, whereas on this\naccount whether or not the Persons are one god is relative to how we\nconceptualize them. \nSheiva Kleinschmidt argues that theories on which composition is\nexplained in terms of identity are of no use to the trinitarian, for\nsuch theories add no significant options to the options the\ntrinitarian already has (Kleinschmidt 2012). \nSome Trinity theories don’t fit in to either one-self or\nthree-self categories, because they imply more divine selves than\nthree, less than one, or are unclear about how many selves there might\nbe in the Trinity. \nChad McIntosh (2015) formulates a Trinity theory which is similar to\nthree-self theories except that it adds God the Trinity as a fourth\ndivine self. This theory is inspired by recent work by philosophers on\ngroup persons. It’s a longstanding part of legal tradition to\ntreat various kinds of non-persons, such as corporations, as\nif they were persons. This is particularly useful, e.g. in\nholding corporations responsible for damages they cause. But some\nphilosophers have argued for group agency realism, the thesis that\nsome groups of persons are themselves literal persons, with interests,\nknowledge, freedom, power to intentionally act, and moral\nresponsibility (168–71). McIntosh distinguishes\n“intrinsicist” persons, persons which are so because of\ntheir nature, from “functional” persons, persons which are\nso because of how they function. On this account the Persons of\nthe Trinity are intrinsicist persons, while God the Trinity is a\nfunctional person (171). \nMcIntosh argues that since moral responsibility implies personhood (of\nsome kind), and it is clear that the Trinity must be praiseworthy,\ne.g. “for having achieved salvation for humankind” or\n“just for having the character of a loving community”,\nthen the Trinity must himself be a person. And it is widely agreed by\nChristians that the Trinity should be worshiped, but a non-person\ncan’t be a fitting recipient of worship (173). \nOne may object that the Christian God is supposed to be a Trinity of\nPersons, not a Quaternity of Persons. As Leftow objects to another\ntheory, \nMcIntosh replies that the tradition demands that there are exactly\nthree Persons (Greek: hypostases) which share the divine\nnature or essence, which is captured by his claim that there are\nexactly three intrinsicist persons. This account does not\nclaim that God is a fourth hypostasis, a fourth intrinsicist person.\nRather, God is a functional person, a person not by his essence, but\nrather who exists as a person because of the unified functioning of\nthe Father, Son, and Spirit (174). \nMcIntosh argues that the theory neatly sidesteps a number of common\nobjections to three-self theories: here, God is a self and not merely\na group or a composite object which is less than a self. In contrast\nwith three-self theories, as a literal self, personal pronouns may be\nliterally used of him. And this group which is a “he” can\nhave the divine attributes which imply being a self, such as\nomniscience and moral perfection. (See sections\n 2.4,\n 2.5.) It also, McIntosh argues, either falsifies or casts\ndoubt on the key premise in Tuggy’s divine deception argument\nagainst three-self theories (175–7, 180; see section\n 2.3.)\n Following some Old Testament scholars, McIntosh claims that ancient\nIsraelites recognized many groups, including their own nation, as\nliteral (group, functional) persons. He argues that this belief\nexplains a number of oddities in the Old Testament, such as the idea\nof group guilt, apparent beings which seem in some sense to be\nextensions of Yahweh’s personhood, and texts which switch easily\nbetween singular and plural subjects (177–80). \nH. E. Baber (2002) argues that a Trinity theory may posit the\nPersons as “successive, non-overlapping temporal parts of\none God” (11). This one God is neither simple nor timeless, but\nis a temporally extended self with shorter-lived temporally extended\nselves as his parts. This does not violate the requirement of\nmonotheism, because we should count gods by “tensed\nidentity”, which is “not identity but rather the relation\nthat obtains between individuals at a time, t, when they\nshare a stage [i.e. a temporal part] at t” (5). At any\ngiven time, only one self bears this relation of temporal-stage\nsharing with God. \nHow can any of these selves be divine given that they are neither\ntimeless nor everlasting? Following Parfit, she argues that a self may\nlast through time without being identical to any later self at the\nlater times; that is, “identity is not what matters for\nsurvival” (6). Each of these non-eternal selves, then,\ncounts as the continuation of the previous one, and is everlasting in\nthe sense that it is a temporal part of an everlasting whole, God. The\nobscure traditional generation and procession relations are\nre-interpreted as non-causal relations between God and two of his\ntemporal parts, the Son and Spirit (13–4). In a later paper, she\nargues that any trinitarian may and should accept this\nre-interpretation (Baber 2008). \nAlthough Baber argues that this is a “minimally\ndecent” Trinity theory, she admits that it is heretical, and\nnames it a “Neo-Sabellian” theory, because on it, the\nPersons of the Trinity are non-overlapping, temporary modes of the one\nGod (15; on Sabellianism see section\n 1.3).\n But the Persons in this theory are not mere modes; they are\ntruly substances and selves, and there are (at least) three of them,\nthough each is counted as the continuation of the one(s) preceding\nhim. It is unclear whether the theory posits only three\nselves (10–1). But she argues that the theory is preferable to\nmany of its rivals “since it does not commit us to relative\nidentity or require any ad hoc philosophical\ncommitments” (15), and even though its divine selves don’t\noverlap, sense can be made of, e.g. Jesus’s interaction with his\nFather (meaning not the prior divine Person, but God, the temporal\nwhole of whom Jesus is a temporal part) (11–4). \nThis theory is notable in being a case not of rational reconstruction,\nbut of doctrinal revision (Tuggy 2011a). Many of its features are\ncontroversial, such as its unorthodoxy, its metaphysical commitments\nto temporal parts and the lasting of selves without diachronic\nidentity, its denials of divine simplicity and divine timelessness,\nand its redefinitions of “monotheism”,\n“generation”, and “procession”. \nIn a later discussion Baber argues that some form or other of\nSabellianism about the Trinity is theoretically straightforward and\nfits well with popular Christian piety. Further, such theories can\nsurvive the common objections that they imply that God is only\ncontingently trinitarian, and that they characterize God only in\nrelation to the cosmos. While some Sabellian theories do have those\nimplications, Baber argues that a trinitarian may just accept them\n(2019, 134–8). \nAlternately, Baber (2019) develops a structuralist approach to the\nTrinity which doesn't imply anything about how many selves it\ninvolves. \nRob Koons (2018) constructs an account inspired by Aquinas, Augustine,\nand recent work on “qua-objects” by Fine and by Asher.\nFollowing the latter, Koons understands “qua-modified\nnoun phrases as picking out intentional objects consisting of\ntropes or accidents, metaphysical parts of the base object”\n(346). Koons holds that even everyday objects imply the existence of\nsuch intentional objects, i.e. things that can be thought. Thus, we\ncan distinguish Trump-qua-husband from Trump-qua-President; while\nthese are real objects of thought, they both amount to being\nproperties of Trump, which Koons thinks of as metaphysical parts of\nDonald Trump. \nUnlike most of the other theories in this entry, Koons builds his on\nthe foundation of divine simplicity, traditionally understood.\nAccording to this, God is numerically identical with his nature, his\none action, and his existence. God has no accidental (non-essential)\nproperties and no proper parts, and he just is any essential property\nof his. In sum, God has no parts or components in any sense (339).\nWhile one might suppose that this would rule out God being a Trinity,\nKoons argues that to the contrary, we can understand how and why God\nis a Trinity by “locating God in an extreme and exotic region of\nlogical space” (ibid.) \nThe divine nature just is any divine attribute, e.g. omnipotence. In\naddition, Koons argues that the divine nature just is “an\nintentional relation: namely, perfect knowledge and perfect\nlove.”. Understanding or knowledge generally should be\nunderstood “as an internal relation between the mind\nand its external object.” (340). \nFollowing Aquinas, Koons says that God (a.k.a. the divine nature)\nunderstands all things through himself; God is essentially omniscient\nand essentially self-understanding. Thus, the divine nature implies\nthe existence of three relational qua-objects, which are the Persons\nof the Trinity. These are not merely three ways we can think of God,\nor three ways God may appear to us, but rather these objects result\nfrom God’s essential self-understanding (345). Each of\nthese four things–God (the divine nature), the Father, the Son,\nand the Spirit–has the divine nature as its one metaphysical\ncomponent, and each has all the divine attributes (346). Each of those\nfour is numerically distinct from each of the three others (347). \nThe theory requires more than the relation of (absolute) numerical\nsameness or identity. In addition, Koons defines a relation of\n“real” sameness. Like identity, this relation is reflexive\nand symmetrical, but unlike identity it is neither transitive nor\nEuclidian (such that if any x is related to some y and to some z then\nthis implies that y and z are related in that same way). Thus, real\nsameness is not an equivalence relation (348, 357 n. 5) According to\nthis theory each Person is really the same as the divine nature (God),\nbut not identical to him. But no Person here is really the same as any\nother Person; all three are really distinct from one another. To\nsummarize: there are four divine realities on this model of the\nTrinity. The three Persons are so many qua-objects, while God is not.\nNone of these four is really distinct from God; all are really the\nsame as him. Yet none of the four is identical to any of the others\n(348). \nOne may ask why there should be only three qua-objects here, when\nobjects like a human person or an apple, having many properties, might\nimply hundreds or thousands of qua-objects. The answer is that not\nevery qua-object of God is a divine Person. Many such, Koons says, are\ncontingent, e.g. God-as-creator, or God-as-friend-of-Abraham; such\nwould not have existed had God not created. And any qua-object of God\nwhich involves only an essential property of his, e.g.\nGod-as-omnipotent, is numerically identical to God (345). To be a\n“hypostatic qua-object” (i.e. a God-as-thing which is a\ndivine Person) something must exist necessarily, be numerically\ndistinct from God, and be such that “It is not wholly grounded\nin a logical or conceptual way on any other divine qua-object\nor objects. So, it must be fully determinate (non-general,\nnon-disjunctive, and non-negative) in its definition” (346).\nThis last condition is meant to prevent the proliferation of divine\nqua-objects (354–6). Koons argues that this account explains why\nthere are exactly three divine Persons. \nDivine love doesn’t imply further Persons because it’s the\nsame relational property as divine self-knowing. God-as-knower\nisn’t numerically the same as God-as-known because of the\nessential asymmetry of the knowing relation (ibid.). Divine\nlove, Koons says, is a kind of charity of friendship; thus, lover and\nbeloved can’t be numerically identical. So if the Father loves\nthe Son, this implies that they are numerically distinct\n(non-identical). It also implies that they are really distinct and not\nreally the same. In specifying what he means by real distinctness\nKoons writes, \nThe distinction between these qua-objects Father and Son is intrinsic\nto their ultimate base, God (the divine nature) because he is the\nintrinsic yet relational property of love (348–9). This has the\nconsequence that “the divine nature cannot love or be loved by\nany of the divine Persons” (351). \nKoons argues that this theory has many advantages over some rivals.\nAgainst the constitution based three-self theory of Brower and Rea\n(see section\n 2.1.3),\n it allows for divine simplicity, as the Trinity does not involve any\nmetaphysical components or parts other than the divine nature. And he\nclaims that their account amounts to tritheism, “since each\nPerson is divine in His own unique and incomparable way”. In\ncontrast, on Koons’s theory, “each of the three Persons is\ndivine in the same way–simply by being a divine\nqua-object, and the divine nature is complete and fully\ndivine in itself”. Again, Koons’s theory can, and theirs\ncan’t, explain why there are exactly three divine Persons. And\ntheir theory requires three different odd and hard to explain personal\nattributes (352). As contrasted with any “social” theory,\nthis one doesn’t have divine Persons which are really distinct\nfrom the divine nature (God) (353). \nKoons recognizes that many will object that this theory is\ntetratheism; it features four realities, each of which is divine;\nprima facie, these would be four gods. Koons believes that the real\nsameness of each of the Persons with God should rule out any\npolytheism and rule in monotheism. He offers this definition of\nmonotheism: \nThis would be equivalent to: \nBut a “divine being” is a god. Thus the meaning of this\ndefinition can be restated as: \nThis is a controversial definition; one may think that Koons simply\nredefines “monotheism” as compatible with any number of\ngods greater than zero. Put differently, one may count things by\nidentity. Why can’t one also count gods in this way? Again, if a\nis a god, and b is a god, and they are non-identical, what is it about\n“real sameness” that implies that they’re really the\nsame god? Why isn’t this an ad hoc, theory-saving\ndefinition? \nOne may wonder here how the four realities can be equally divine. It\nwould seem that whereas God (the divine nature) would not exist\nbecause of any other, and so would exist a se, each of the\nqua-object persons would exist because of God, their base.\nWouldn’t this make God greater than each of the Persons? Again,\non this account each of these four is intrinsically and essentially\ndivine, yet the Persons can love, while God can not. How then can all\nfour be omnipotent? \nSome will judge this theory to inherit all the problems of the\ntraditional divine simplicity doctrine it assumes. Others will\nconsider its fit with simplicity to be a feature and not a bug. Koons\npoints out that it also assumes constituent ontology, a Thomistic\naccount of thought, and the claim that the divine nature is an\nintentional relation (356). \nAn account of the Trinity by Daniel Molto tries to preserve the idea\nfound especially in Western creeds that “each divine person is,\nin some sense, all of God” (2018, 395). (Because of this he\nclaims the title “Latin” for the theory.) He employs a\nnon-standard\n mereology\n (theory of parts and wholes) to interpret what he considers to be the\nthree requirements for a Trinity theory: that there’s only one\ngod, that no Person of the Trinity is identical to any other, and that\nin some sense it is true that each Person individually “is\nwholly” God (400). The view is that God, the Father, the Son,\nand the Spirit are all improper parts of one another, while none is\nnumerically identical to any other. This is shown in the following\nchart; the lines represent the symmetrical and transitive improper\nparthood relation. \nOn more “classical” mereological systems, if A is an\nimproper part of B, this implies that A and B are numerically\nidentical, but in the system suggested by Molto, this is denied. He\nargues that this change is not merely theologically motivated, but may\nbe applicable to other issues in metaphysics (410–3). \nMolto discusses a problem for the model which arises from the\ntransitivity of parthood and the axiom that things which are improper\nparts of one another must have all their proper parts in common. If\nthe body of the incarnate Son is a proper part of him, then given\nMolto’s model of the Trinity, this body would also have to be a\nproper part of God, of the Father, and of the Holy Spirit –\nclaims which most Christian theologians would reject. In response, he\nadds three further elements to the model, as shown here: \nHere, D = the divine nature of the Son, N = the human nature of the\nSon, and B = the body of the Son. As before, the lines with arrows on\neach end represent the symmetrical improper parthood relation. In this\nillustration the one-arrow lines represent the asymmetrical proper\nparthood relation. Thus, the divine nature of the Son and the\nhuman nature of the Son are proper parts of the composite Son, and the\nhuman body is a proper part of the human nature (and thus, also of the\ncomposite Son). \nMolto leaves it up to theologians whether this sort of theory is\northodox (514–7). His suggestion is only that this may be a\nsimpler and less controversial solution to the logical problem of the\nTrinity, that is, to showing how trinitarian claims do not imply a\ncontradiction. (397–8, 416–7) \nOften “mystery” is used in a merely honorific sense,\nmeaning a great and important truth or thing relating to religion. In\nthis vein it’s often said that the doctrine of the Trinity is a\nmystery to be adored, rather than a problem to be solved. In the Bible\na “mystery” (Greek: musterion) is simply a truth\nor thing which is or has been somehow hidden (i.e., rendered\nunknowable) by God (Anonymous 1691; Toulmin 1791b). In this sense a\n“revealed mystery” is a contradiction in terms (Whitby\n1841, 101–9). While Paul seems to mainly use\n“mystery” for what used to be hidden but is now\nknown (Tuggy 2003a, 175), it has been argued that Paul assumes that\nwhat has been revealed will continue to be in some sense\n“mysterious” (Boyer 2007, 98–101). \nMysterianism is a meta-theory of the Trinity, that is, a theory about\ntrinitarian theories, to the effect that an acceptable Trinity theory\nmust, given our present epistemic limitations, to some degree lack\nunderstandable content. “Understandable content” here\nmeans propositions expressed by language which the hearer\n“grasps” or understands the meaning of, and which seem to\nher to be consistent. \nAt its extreme, a mysterian may hold that no first-order theory of the\nTrinity is possible, so we must be content with delineating a\nconsistent “grammar of discourse” about the Trinity, i.e.,\npolicies about what should and shouldn’t be said about it. In\nthis extreme form, mysterianism may be a sort of sophisticated\nposition by itself—to the effect that one repeats the creedal\nformulas and refuses on principle to explain how, if at all, one\ninterprets them. More common is a moderate form, where mysterianism\nsupplements a Trinity theory which has some understandable content,\nbut which is vague or otherwise problematic. Thus, mysterianism is\ncommonly held as a supplement to one of the theories of sections\n1–3. Again, it may serve as a supplement not to a full-blown\ntheory (i.e., to a literal model of the Trinity) but rather to one or\nmore (admittedly not very helpful) analogies. (See\n section 3.3.1\n in the supplementary document on the history of trinitarian\ndoctrines.) Unitarian views on the Father, Son, and Spirit are\ntypically motivated in part by hostility to mysterianism. (See the\nsupplementary document on\n unitarianism.)\n But the same can said of many of the theories of sections\n1–3. \nMysterians view their stance as an exercise of theological\nsophistication and epistemic humility. Some mysterians appeal to the\nmedieval tradition of apophatic or negative theology, the view that\none can understand and say what God is not, but not what God is, while\nothers simply appeal to the idea that the human mind is ill-equipped\nto think about transcendent realities. \nTuggy (2003a) lists five different meanings of “mystery”\nin the literature: \nSophisticated mysterians about the Trinity appeal to\n“mysteries” in the fourth and fifth senses. The common\ncore of meaning between them is that a “mystery” is a\ndoctrine which is (to some degree) not understood, in the sense\nexplained above. We here call those who call the Trinity a mystery in\nthe fourth sense “negative mysterians” and those who call\nit a mystery in the fifth sense “positive mysterians”. It\nis most common for theologians to combine the two views, though\nusually one or the other is emphasized. \nSophisticated modern-era mysterians include Leibniz and the theologian\nMoses Stuart (1780–1852). (Antognazza 2007; Leibniz\nTheodicy, 73–122; Stuart 1834, 26–50.) \nThe negative mysterian holds that the true doctrine of the Trinity is\nnot understandable because it is too poor in intelligible content for\nit to positively seem either consistent or inconsistent to us. In the\nlate fourth-century pro-Nicene consensus this takes the form of\nrefusing to state in literal language what there are three of in God,\nhow they’re related to God or to the divine essence, and how\nthey’re related to each other. (See\n section 3.3\n in the supplementary document on the history of Trinity theories.)\nThe Persons of the Trinity, in this way of thinking, are somewhat like\nthree men, but also somewhat like a mind, its thought, and its will,\nand also somewhat like a root, a tree, and a branch. Multiple\nincongruous analogies are given, the idea being that a minimal content\nof the doctrine is thereby expressed, though we remain unable to\nconvert the non-literal claims to literal ones, and may even be unable\nto express in what respects the analogies do and don’t fit.\nNegative mysterianism goes hand in hand with the doctrines of divine\nincomprehensibility (that God or God’s essence can’t be\nunderstood completely, at all, or adequately) and divine ineffability\n(that no human concept, or at least none of some subset of these,\napplies literally to God). Some recent studies have emphasized the\ncentrality of negative mysterianism to the pro-Nicene tradition of\ntrinitarian thought, chastising recent theorists who seem to feel\nunconstrained by it (Ayres 2004; Coakley 1999; Dixon 2003). \nThe practical upshot of this is being content to merely repeat the\napproved trinitarian sentences. Thus, after considering and rejecting\nas inadequate multiple analogies for the Trinity, Gregory of Nazianzus\nconcludes, \nOpponents of this sort of mysterianism object to it as misdirection,\nspecial pleading, neglect of common sense, or even deliberate\nobfuscation. They emphasize that trinitarian theories are human\nconstructs, and a desideratum of any theory is clarity. We literally\ncan’t believe what is expressed in trinitarian language, if we\ndon’t grasp the meaning of it, and to the extent that we\ndon’t understand a doctrine, it can’t guide our other\ntheological beliefs, our actions, or our worship (Cartwright 1987;\nDixon 2003, 125–31; Nye 1691b, 47; Tuggy 2003a, 176–80).\nNegative mysterians reply that it is well-grounded in tradition, and\nthat those who are not naively overconfident in human reason expect\nsome unclarity in the content of this doctrine. \nIn contrast, the positive mysterian holds that the trinitarian\ndoctrine can’t be understood because of an abundance of content.\nThat is, the doctrine seems to contain explicit or implicit\ncontradictions. So while we grasp the meaning of its individual\nclaims, taken together they seem inconsistent, and so the conjunction\nof them is not understandable, in the sense explained above. The\npositive mysterian holds that the human mind is adequate to understand\nmany truths about God, although it breaks down at a certain stage,\nwhen the most profound divinely revealed truths are entertained.\nSometimes an analogy with recent physics is offered; if we find\nmysteries (i.e., apparent contradictions) there, such as light\nappearing to be both a particle and a wave, why should we be shocked\nto find them in theology (van Inwagen 1995, 224–7)? \nThe best-developed positive mysterian theory is that of James Anderson\n(2005, 2007), who develops Alvin Plantinga’s epistemology so\nthat beliefs in mysteries (merely apparent contradictions) may be\nrational, warranted, justified, and known. Orthodox belief about the\nTrinity, Anderson holds, involves believing, for example, that\nJesus is identical to God, the Father is identical to God, and that\nJesus and the Father are not identical. Similarly, one must believe\nthat the Son is omniscient, but lacks knowledge about at least one\nmatter. These, he grants, are apparent contradictions, but\nfor the believer they are strongly warranted and justified by the\ndivine testimony of scripture. He argues that numerous attempts by\nrecent theologians and philosophers to interpret one of the apparently\ncontradictory pairs in a way that makes the pair consistent always\nresult in a lapse of orthodoxy (2007, 11–59). He argues that the\nChristian should take these trinitarian mysteries to be\n“MACRUEs”, merely apparent contradictions resulting from\nunarticulated equivocations, and he gives plausible non-theological\nexamples of these (220–5). \nIt is plausible that if a claim appears contradictory to someone, she\nthereby by has a strong epistemic “defeater” for that\nbelief, i.e., a further belief or other mental state which robs the\nfirst belief of rational justification and/or warrant. A stock example\nis a man viewing apparently red objects. The man then learns that a\nred light is shining on them. In learning this, he acquires a defeater\nfor his belief that the items before him are red. Thus with the\nTrinity, if the believer discovers an apparent contradiction in her\nTrinity theory, doesn’t that defeat her belief in that theory?\nAnderson argues that it does not, at least, if she reflects properly\non the situation. The above thought, Anderson argues, should be\ncountered with the doctrine of divine incomprehensibility, which says\nthat we don’t know all there is to know about God. Given this\ntruth, the believer should not be surprised to find herself in the\nabove epistemic situation, and so, the believer’s trinitarian\nbelief is either insulated from defeat, or if it’s already been\ndefeated, that defeat is undone by the preceding realization (2007,\n209–54). \nDale Tuggy (2011a) argues that Anderson’s doctrine of divine\nincomprehensibility is true but trivial, and not obviously relevant to\nthe rationality of belief in apparent contradictions about God. The\nprobability of our being stuck with such beliefs is a function not\nonly of God’s greatness in comparison to humans’ cognitive\npowers, but also of what and how much God chooses to reveal about\nhimself. Nor is it clear that God would be motivated to pay the costs\nof inflicting apparently contradictory divine revelations on us.\nMoreover, Anderson has not ruled out that the apparent contradictions\ncome not from the texts alone, but also from our theories or\npre-existing beliefs. Finally, he argues that due to the comparative\nstrength of “seemings”, a believer committed to paradoxes\nlike those cited above will, sooner or later, acquire an epistemic\ndefeater for her beliefs. \nIn a reply, Anderson (2018) denies that divine incomprehensibility is\ntrivial, while agreeing that many things other than God are\nincomprehensible (297). While Tuggy had attacked his suggestions about\nwhy God would want to afflict us with apparent contradictions,\nAnderson clarifies that \nThe defense doesn’t require, Anderson argues, any more than that\nMACRUEs are “not very improbable given theism”\n(299). As to whether these apparent contradictions result from the\ntexts rightly understood, or whether they result from the texts\ntogether with mistaken assumptions we bring to them, this is a\nquestion only biblical exegesis can decide, not any a priori\nconsiderations (300). As to Tuggy’s charge that a believer in\ntheological paradoxes will inevitably acquire an undefeated defeater\nfor her beliefs, Anderson argues that this has not been shown, and\nthat Tuggy overlooks how a believer may reasonably add a relevant\nbelief to her seemingly inconsistent set of beliefs, such as that the\napparently conflicting claims P and Q are only approximately true, or\nthat “P and Q are the best way for her to conceptualize matters\ngiven the information available to her, but they don’t represent\nthe whole story” (304). \nAnderson’s central idea is that the alleged contradictions\nof Christian doctrine will turn out to be merely apparent. In\ncontrast, some theologians have held that doctrines including the\nTrinity imply not merely apparent but also real contradictions, but\nare nonetheless true. Such hold that there are exceptions to the law\nof non-contradiction. While some philosophers have argued on mostly\nnon-religious grounds for\n dialetheism,\n the claim that there can be true (genuine, not merely apparent)\ncontradictions, this position has for the most part not been taken\nseriously by analytic theologians (Anderson 2007, 117–26) (For a\nrecent exception, see Beall 2019.) \nAnalytic literature on the Trinity has been laser-focused on the\nlogical coherence of “the” doctrine, addressing an\nimagined critic arguing that the doctrine is clearly incoherent. They\ndo this by suggesting models of the Trinity, intelligible and arguably\ncoherent interpretations of most or all of the traditional language.\nBut in recent work the tools of analytic philosophy have been applied\nto several closely related issues. \nThe term “Trinity” has been used either as a singular\nreferring term or as a plural referring term (Tuggy 2016, 2020). The\nfirst usage goes hand in hand with the claim that the one God just is\nthe tripersonal God, the Trinity. But the earlier  use of\n“Trinity”–(Greek: trias, Latin:\ntrinitas) where that term refers to a “they” and\nnot a “he” or an “it”–still survives,\nand some Trinty theories imply that the term “Trinity” can\nrefer only in this way. \nMost statements of faith by trinitarian Christian groups seem to\nassume or imply that the Trinity just is God (and vice-versa); the\nonly god is the tripersonal God, the Trinity, and\n“Trinity” is a singular referring term denoting that\nreality. This God, it is assumed, does not merely happen to be\ntripersonal, but must be so; on such a view, it looks like\ntripersonality will be an essential divine attribute. Thus, it can\nseem axiomatic that “Christians hold that God is Trinitarian in\nGod’s essential nature” (Davis and Yang 2017, 226). Some\nTrinity theories embrace this (section\n 2.5).\n However, if this is so, it is hard to see how each of the Persons\ncould be divine in the way the one God is divine, since generally\ntrinitarians don’t want to say that each is himself tripersonal.\n(See section\n  2.1.5\n for an exception.) Thus, some Trinity theories eschew a thing which\nis tripersonal, while affirming three divine Persons whose divinity\ndoes not require tripersonality (sections\n 2.1.3,\n 2.1.4). For such theories, “Trinity” is a plural\nreferring term. \nWhile many discussions start with claims that are seen as the heart of\nthe “Athanasian” creed, a recent piece by Justin Mooney\n(2018, 1) starts with this seemingly inconsistent triad of claims: \nDale Tuggy (2014, 186) presents this inconsistent triad. \nOne-self trinitarians deny 3, and three-self trinitarians deny 1. But\nTuggy argues that for scriptural reasons a Christian should deny 2.\n(See also section\n 5.4\n and the supplementary document on the history of trinitarian\ndoctrines,\n section 2.) \nRyan Byerly (2019) explains “the philosophical challenge of the\nTrinity” as centering on the key Nicene term\n“consubstantial” (Greek: homoousios). How can the\nthree Persons be “consubstantial” so that each equally in\nsome sense “is God”, where this implies neither their\nnumerical identity, nor that there’s more than one god? \nJedwab and Keller (2019, 173) see the fundamental challenge for the\northodox trinitarian as showing how this seemingly inconsistent triad\nof claims is, rightly understood, consistent: \nThey argue that this must involve paraphrases, clearer formulations of\n1–3 which can be seen as possibly all true. They compare how the\ntheories of sections\n 2.1,\n 2.3, and\n 1.5\n above must do this, and conclude that it is easier for the first of\nthese to provide paraphrases which plausibly express the same claims\nas the originals, which is a point in favor of such relative identity\ntheories. \nBeau Branson (2019) explores these claims as constituting “the\nlogical problem of the Trinity”: each Person “is\nGod”, they are distinct from one another, and yet there is only\none thing which “is God”. These provide materials for\na formidable argument against any doctrine that entails those seven\nclaims. He argues that all possible non-heretical solutions to that\nproblem either equivocate on the predicate “is God”\n(roughly: what are called “social” theories, discussed in\nsections 2.2–7) or insist that divine Persons must be counted by\nsome relation other than “absolute” or\n“classical” identity (i.e. relative identity theories as\ndiscussed in section\n 2.1). \nAnother recent piece compares different approaches to the Trinity by\nhow they respond to an anti-trinitarian argument based on alleged\ndifferences between the Father and the Son (Tuggy 2016b). \nA tradition going back at least to Cartwright (1987) is using the\nlanguage of the so-called “Athanasian” creed to generate\ncontradictions, the task of the philosophical theologian then being to\nshow how these can be avoided by more careful analysis. This\nLatin document is by an unknown author, and is not the product of any\nknown council. Modern scholarship places it some time in the fifth\ncentury, well after the life of Athanasius (d. 373), and sees it as\ninfluenced by the writings of Augustine (Kelly 1964). Objecting to\nmaking it a standard of trinitarian theology, several authors have\npointed out its dubious provenance and coherence, and have observed\nthat it has mainly been accepted in the Western realm and not in the\nEast, and that it seems to stack the deck against three-self theories\n(Layman 2016 136–7, 169–71; McCall 2003, 427; Tuggy 2003b,\n450–55). Tuggy (2016b) objects that starting with this\nproblematic creed causes analytic theologians to neglect the question\nof if and how the teaching of this creed is the same as\nvarious statements from the “ecumenical” councils,\npre-Nicene theologies, or the Bible. But William Hasker argues that\nrightly understood, the claims of this creed may not be\nparadoxical, as it is largely concerned with what may and may not be\nsaid (2013b, 250–4). \nApart from the “Athanasian” creed, H.E. Baber describes\nfive different foundations for theorizing about the Trinity, endorsing\nthe fourth. \nSome in the literature fall cleanly into one of Baber’s\ncategories, but more commonly, work in analytic theology is done while\nleaving unclear just what are the foundations of trinitarian\ntheorizing. Following the example of his earlier work on christology,\nTimothy Pawl (2020) focuses on the teachings of the\n“ecumenical” councils, which arguably give the central\ntrinitarian language of catholic traditions. \nIn favor of Baber’s second approach, Beau Branson (2018)\ncritiques what he calls “the virtue\napproach”–basically, treating theological issues like\nmetaphysical or logical puzzles calling for creative\ntheorizing–as point-missing, question begging, and unclear.\nIn contrast, he advocates for “the historical approach”,\nwhich assumes that the content of “the doctrine of the\nTrinity” should be considered as fixed by the views of\n“mainly various fourth-century theologians” (Section 4).\nIt is misguided, he argues, to focus merely on the theoretical virtues\nof various rational reconstructions of what traditional Trinity\nlanguage is really supposed to be expressing, as most of these will\nnot plausibly be expressing the historical doctrine.\nNew-fangled accounts, Branson argues, have a burden of showing how\nthey, if coherent, imply that the historical doctrine of the Trinity\nis coherent, and indeed why the former should even count as a version\nof the latter (Section 5). (Similarly with other theoretical virtues.)\nAt any rate, nothing about the project of analytic theology requires\nthe neglect of the crucial historical definers of the Trinity doctrine\n(Section 13). \nAnalytic theologians have expended much effort on metaphysical models\nwhich if accurate would arguably show that “the\ndoctrine of the Trinity” is coherent (i.e. seemingly not\nself-contradictory). But only a recent monograph by Vlastimil\nVohánka (2014) asks in depth how, if at all, a person might be\nable to know that the doctrine of the Trinity is logically possible.\nVohánka argues for “Weak Modal Scepticism about the\nTrinity Doctrine” (83), which is the claim that “it is\npsychologically impossible to see evidently and apart from religious\nexperience that the Trinity doctrine is logically possible”\n(86). The arguments for this conclusion defy easy summary (but see\nChapter 7 and Jaskolla 2015). What is “the doctrine” in\nquestion? Vohánka uses a minimal definition, that “there\nare three persons, each of whom is God but there is just one being\nwhich is God” (47). Admittedly, this better fits one-self\ntheories than it does three or four-self theories (52–7) Like\nmost, Vohánka assumes that a Trinity doctrine is essential to\nChristianity (57–8), so the main thesis implies the\nimpossibility of knowing that Christianity is logically possible. But\nthe overall project is not an attack on the truth or knowability of\nChristianity (see the author’s clarifications about his aims on\n244–7, 276–7). Rather, such claims as the Trinity and\nChristianity seemingly can’t be evident to us (i.e. roughly,\ncan’t be obviously true to us, as is 1+1=2 and such\npropositions–see 18), and moreover, we shouldn’t expect\nthat we’ll have any religious experience in this life which is\nsufficient to make them evident (277). For all that’s been said,\nsuch claims “may well be epistemically justified, well-argued,\nhave clearly high non-logical probability, etc.” (279). But the\nChristian philosopher should give up on “fulfilling the\nclassical idea of evidentness in matters viewed by him as of utmost\nimportance: the truth of Christianity and of the Trinity\ndoctrine” (ibid.). \nIn some scholarly circles it is taken as obvious that New Testament\nteaching is not trinitarian–that it neither asserts, nor\nimplies, nor assumes anything about a tripersonal God (see e.g. Baber\n2019, 148–56; Küng 1995, 95–6; see also\n supplement on the history of Trinity doctrines, section 2).\n But most analytic literature on the Trinity assumes the truth of an\northodox narrative about where Trinity theories come from. According\nto this, from the beginning Christians were implicitly trinitarian;\nthat is, they held views which imply that God is a Trinity, but\ntypically did not realize this or have adequate language to express\nit. By at least the late 300s, they had gained enough new language\nand/or concepts to express what they had been committed to all\nalong. \nBut in recent analytic literature on the Trinity there are two\ncounternarratives, both of which see the idea of a triune God as\nentering into Christian traditions in the last half of the 300s. Beau\nBranson argues that “Monarchical Trinitarianism”, which in\nhis view correctly understands the theology of the authoritative\nfourth century Greek “fathers” (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory\nof Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus) is a trinitarian theology on which\n“Strictly speaking, The One God just is the Father”\n(Branson forthcoming, Section 6). He contrasts this with most other\nTrinity theories, which he calls “egalitarian” or\n“symmetrical”, theories on which “all three persons\nhave an ‘equal claim’ to being called ‘God,’\nin any and every sense.” (ibid.) Branson criticizes\nTuggy’s (2016a) analyses of the concepts trinitarian and\nunitarian, and offers rival definitions on which “Monarchical\nTrinitarianism” is trinitarian and not unitarian. To be\ntrinitarian, a theology needs only to assert that “there are\nexactly three divine ‘persons’ (or individuals, etc.).\nNevertheless…there is exactly one God” (Section 5). As\nBranson understands the history of Christian theology, the idea that\n“the Trinity” is a tripersonal God is a misunderstanding\nof tradition which is due particularly to “Western”\nthinkers, such as Augustine. Branson cites some recent Orthodox\ntheologians who hold, like John Behr, that “there is not One God\nthe Trinity, but One God Father Almighty” (Behr 2018, 330). In\nreply, Tuggy has argued that recent Orthodox theologians\nseem divided on this point, and that the idea of a triune God\n(the one God as the Trinity) is found even in some of the Greek\nwriters Branson claims as exemplars of theological orthodoxy (Tuggy\n2020). \nAnother recent counternarrative sees ancient mainstream Christian\ntheology as changing from unitarian to trinitarian. Tuggy (2019)\nargues that in the New Testament the one God is not the Trinity but\nrather the Father alone. The argument moves from facts about the texts\nof the New Testament to what the authors probably thought about the\none God, using what philosophers of science call the likelihood\nprinciple or the prime principle of confirmation. Tuggy sees such\nidentification of the one God with the Father dominating early\nChristian theologies until around the time of the second ecumenical\ncouncil in 381 C.E. (Tuggy 2017, Chapter 5). Then, the Son and the\nSpirit, which in many 2nd to early 4th c. speculations were two lesser\ndeities in addition to God, were taught to, together with the Father,\nsomehow comprise the one God, the Trinity.
