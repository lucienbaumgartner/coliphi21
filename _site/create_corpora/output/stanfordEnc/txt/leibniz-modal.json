This entry will address this second aspect of his\nphilosophy. In the course of his writings, Leibniz developed an\napproach to questions of modality—necessity, possibility,\ncontingency—that not only served an important function within\nhis general metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical theology but\nalso has continuing interest today. Indeed, it has been suggested that\n20th-century developments in modal logic were either based\non Leibnizian insights or at least had a Leibnizian spirit.\n\n\n\nIn order to explain Leibniz's modal metaphysics—the metaphysics\nof necessity, contingency, and possibility—we must look first at\nthe foundation of Leibniz's system more generally: his conception of\nan individual substance. In §8 of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics, Leibniz presents his classic picture, writing: In other words, each individual substance has a complete\nindividual concept (CIC), which contains (or from which are\ndeducible) all predicates true of it past, present, and\nfuture. Leibniz asks his reader to consider the case of Alexander the\nGreat. On his view, God can, as it were, look at the complete\nindividual concept of Alexander and see that he conquered Darius and\nPorus, that he was the student of Aristotle, that his armies would\nmarch into India, and so on. For our purposes, it will suffice to\nthink of the CIC as the essence of an individual substance and to\nthink of God as able to survey all essences of all individual\nsubstances. (The issue is, in fact, vexed; for insightful\npresentations of views rivaling that presented here, see Sleigh 1990\nor Cover and Hawthorne 1999.)  Further, according to Leibniz, one of\nthe consequences of this view of the nature of an individual substance\nis that no two substances can be qualitatively identical and differ\nnumerically.  In other words, the Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles (PII) follows from this conception of the nature of\nsubstance, and PII entails that, for any possible world, there is at\nmost one instance of a CIC. \n\nIndividual substances, of course, are parts of, or rather, members of a\nworld. In other words, a world is a set of individual\nsubstances; or, as Leibniz puts in the opening line of On the\nUltimate Origination of Things, a world is a “collection of\nfinite things.” (G VII 302/AG 149) More specifically,\nLeibniz tells Bourguet, “the universe is only a certain kind of\ncollection of compossibles; and the actual universe is the collection\nof all possible existents, that is, of those things that form the\nrichest composite.” (G III 573) In saying that a world is a\nset of compossible things, however, Leibniz is saying that a world is a\nkind of collection of things that God could bring into\nexistence. For not even God can bring into existence a world in\nwhich there is some contradiction among its members or their\nproperties. But this opens up the question: Just what is meant by\na contradiction in the case of the members of a world? \n\nLet us say that two or more substances are compossible if and only\nif there is no contradiction between the predicates derivable from\ntheir CICs. For example, consider the two individuals, Don and\nRon. One of Don's properties is being the tallest man\n(at time t); one of Ron's properties is also being the\ntallest man (at time t). Naturally, Don and Ron cannot then\ninhabit the same world. On the other hand, each could have the\nproperty being over 2 meters tall and be members of the same\nworld. Now in Leibniz's fully developed metaphysics this\nexample might not be considered a good one, since it is most likely the\ncase that Leibnizian individuals are not to be thought of as\nconstituted by such relational properties. Rather than thinking\nof compossibility in terms of the properties of substances, it might be\neasier to think of it in terms of the perceptions of substances.\nCertainly, Don and Ron cannot be said to be members of the same world\nif Don perceives the moon landing of Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969 and Ron\ndoes not (or would not)—and not simply because he does not have\na television set, but because on his July 20, 1969, there is\nno United States of America, let alone a space program. From\nthis, it should also be clear that the compossibility of substances in\na world is another manifestation of Leibniz's thesis of the\nuniversal harmony of perceptions of substances. \n\nA possible world, however, is not simply a set of compossible\nindividuals. According to Leibniz, a possible world also entails\ncertain laws of nature. As Leibniz says to Arnauld in a letter\nfrom 14 July 1686, \n\nLeibniz's basic idea here should conform closely with our\nintuitions. Imagine God's considering a set of\nindividuals {a, b, c, d}. From God's point of view\nhe could choose to actualize this world with one set, L*, of\nlaws of nature or with another set of laws, L**. And\nthis choice represents a choice between two possible worlds. This\nis similar to our saying that we would have a different world\nif the gravitational constant were different. Now, this way of\nspeaking is not exactly right, for on Leibniz's view, the\ndifferent sets of laws would ultimately produce different properties\nand perceptions with the individual substances. As a result, the\nindividuals in the worlds governed by L* and L**\nwould strictly speaking be different. \n\nThe reason Leibniz mentions the different laws governing the different\npossible worlds is that the systems of laws and their effects serve as\ncriteria by which God chooses a world. We know that, for Leibniz,\nGod chooses the “best of all possible worlds.” In\n§6 the Discourse on Metaphysics, however, we learn that\nthis means that God chooses the world that is simplest in hypotheses\n(or laws) and richest in phenomena. Thus, while one might be\ntempted to see natural laws as derivative of the actual properties and\nperceptions of individual substances, in fact they are objects of\nGod's choice. \n\nWhen Leibniz speaks of a possible world, he means a set of\ncompossible, finite things that God could have brought into\nexistence if he were not constrained by the goodness that is\npart of his nature. The actual world, on the other hand, is\nsimply that set of finite things that is instantiated by God, because\nit is greatest in goodness, reality and perfection. Naturally, the\nfact that we are here experiencing this world – the actual\nworld – means that there is at least one possible world. So are\nthere others? \n\nYes, indeed, there are. At least Leibniz thinks so. In his view, as we\nsaw above, there are an infinite number of possible worlds –\nworlds that God did not see fit to bring into existence. Now, given\nthat Leibniz's safe claim is that “[t]here are as many possible\nworlds as there are series of things that can be conceived that do not\nimply a contradiction,” (Grua 390) it might still be the case\nthat there is only one possible world – only one set of\nessences that implies no contradiction. If we accept the claim that a\npossible world is simply any set of compossible individuals (i.e. a\nset of individuals whose properties or perceptions do not contradict\neach other), then there is a rather trivial way to show that there are\nan infinite number of possible worlds. Namely, we just have an\ninfinity of one-object worlds: thus w1 contains a\nblue, 8lb.  bowling ball; w2, a red, 10lb. bowling\nball; w3, a pepperoni\npizza; w4, a bicycle; and so on. We could even\nimagine worlds with two, three, or more objects. \n\nNow, Leibniz's reasons for proposing an infinity of possible worlds\nare somewhat different. In his short essay On Contingency\n(De contingentia, 1689?), Leibniz makes the following\nclaim: \n\nThe point here is that there are unactualized possibles as\nexemplified in works of fiction. In other words, a work of fiction\nrepresents some way the world could be. (To be precise, works\nof fiction represent partial ways worlds could be since they\ndo not (and cannot) depict complete or total\nworlds. For example, was Lincoln shot in the world described\nby Moby-Dick? We don't know.)  But, insofar as these\npossibles conflict among themselves, it is clear that not all\npossibles are compossible. Rather, as we saw above, sets of\ncompossible individuals are Leibniz's possible worlds.  If we add to\nthis picture the idea that each individual has a complete individual\nconcept – that is, a determinate concept – which is\nsufficient to distinguish it from every other possible world, then we\nsee that possible individuals are tied to determinate possible\nworlds. \n\nBut what is the character of these non-actualized possibles?\nThe most natural assumption is that they are like individual substances\nas characterized by Leibniz in Discourse on Metaphysics\n§8, that is, as having complete individual concepts. In\nother words, all individuals (actual or merely possible) have\ndeterminate essences. In the case of merely possible individuals,\nhowever, their being is contained solely in the divine mind.\nConsider Leibniz's claim in the Theodicy §189:\n“In the region of the eternal verities are found all the\npossibles.” (G VI 229/H 246) And, in §44 of the\nMonadology, in the middle of his argument for God's\nnecessary existence, Leibniz says, “if there is reality in\nessences or possibles, or indeed, in eternal truths, this reality must\nbe grounded in something existent and actual, and consequently, it must\nbe grounded in the existence of the necessary being, in whom essence\ninvolves existence, that is, in whom possible being is sufficient for\nactual being.” (G VI 614/AG 218) In other words, there will\nbe determinate essences of some substances that are actualized in the\nworld as well as determinate essences of substances that exist solely\nin the divine intellect. \n\nBy way of contrast, Spinoza argues in the Ethics (Ip33) that\nthere are no unactualized possibles. In the case of a story\ndepicting another “reality,” we have only partial and\nconfused knowledge of the world depicted. If we were to\nhave true knowledge of the way all the characters and their actions\nextend backward and forward in time, we could ultimately arrive at some\ncontradiction. Moreover, Spinoza holds that everything that is\ntruly possible will be expressed at some point as God or nature\nexpresses its infinite essence. That is, since God is a substance\nof infinite attributes expressed in infinite ways, everything that is\npossible finds existence at some point in this\nworld. Of course, this difference between Leibniz and Spinoza is\nlargely attributable to Leibniz's adherence to what Spinoza finds\nso wrong: the anthropomorphic conception of God and the attendant\ndistinction between divine intellect and will, which is what allows for\nGod's supposed contemplation of non-existent possibles. \n\nIn Meaning and Necessity, Rudolf Carnap suggests that a\nLeibnizian possible world is represented by his\nstate-descriptions: a class of sentences containing, for\nevery atomic sentence, either it or its negation. In other words, for\neach possible world there is a series of propositions that will fully\ndescribe that world. The idea of a possible world as being such a set\nof sentences or propositions leads naturally to the notion of a\n“world-book,” a term employed by Alvin Plantinga\n(The Nature of Necessity). Lest such devices seem\nanachronistic, it should be pointed out that, in the fascinating\nconclusion to the Theodicy, Leibniz speaks in a similar way;\nindeed, Leibniz's parable is something that one might imagine has come\nstraight from Jorge Luis Borges (cf. “The Library of\nBabel”). The story concerns Theodorus, a high priest present\nwhen Sextus Tarquinius complains to Jupiter about his fate.  (Sextus\nwas the son of the last king of Rome, whose crime of raping Lucretia\nso incensed Brutus that he led a revolt that ultimately abolished the\nmonarchy and began the Roman Republic.) Theodorus is moved by Sextus'\ncomplaint and is sent to receive instruction at the temple of Pallas\nAthena where he is shown “the palace of the fates.”\nAccording to Athena, “Here are representations not only of that\nwhich happens but also of all that which is possible. Jupiter, having\nsurveyed them before the beginning of the existing world, classified\nthe possibilities into worlds, and chose the best of all.”\n(Theodicy §414: G VI 363/H 370) She continues, \n\nTheodorus is led into one of the halls of the palace and, observing\na great volume of writings in the hall, asks what it is.\n“It is,” Athena tells him, “the history of this world\nwhich we are now visiting…; it is the book of fates.”\n(Theodicy §415: G VI 363/H 371–72) And, finally, we\nhave an argument for the infinity of worlds wrapped in a fantasy\ntale: \n\nLeibniz makes clear here his basic view of God's\nobligation to choose the best world possible, as well as his\nview that, if there were not a single best world, no world at all\nwould have been brought into existence. At the same time, the argument\nfor the infinity of possible worlds given here is rather comical:\n(granted, there must be one best world) for any world you can imagine\n(or find in the pyramid), there is one that is worse.  So much for\nLeibniz the optimist!  \n\nThe world-books are on permanent display in the divine intellect.\nThis is what Leibniz means when he says that they reside in the realm\nof eternal verities. But one thing should be absolutely clear:\nLeibniz is no modal realist à la David Lewis. Although\nLeibniz claims that there are an infinity of possible worlds,\nhe does not mean that infinitely many possible worlds exist in the same\nway as this (actual) world does, or that infinitely many worlds are\nrunning, as it were, parallel to this one, or that “actual”\nis an indexical expression like “here” and “now.”\nThe existence claim commits Leibniz only to the existence of different ways\nthe world could be and to the shelving of these world-books in the\ninfinite and eternal library of the divine mind. As he puts it in\nthe same letter to Arnauld, “there is no other reality in pure\npossibles than the reality they have in the divine\nunderstanding.” (G II 45/AG 75) But it is crucial to\nLeibniz's position that there be one and only one actual\nworld, the best of all possible worlds. As we have seen, God is\nobligated to bring this one world into existence. And,\nwe have also seen that, according to Leibniz, if there were no uniquely\nbest world, then God would not have brought any world into\nexistence. (And God could not simply play Eenee, Meenee,\nMainee, Mo! with two worlds; he must, according to the Principle\nof Sufficient Reason, have a ground for his decision.) Further,\nthere cannot be two worlds that are absolutely equal in terms of their\ndegrees of perfection, for God, by virtue of his omnipotence and\nomniscience, must be able to determine some distinction\nbetween the worlds. And if God had actualized more than one world\nand they had been of different degrees of perfection, then God would\nhave brought into existence that which is less perfect than possible (a\nviolation of the requirements of divine benevolence). (Concerning\nthe reasons for this world, more below.) \n\nOne reason that Leibniz's conception of possible worlds has\nattracted the sympathetic attention of some contemporary philosophers\nand has proven appealing is that it appears to foreshadow the\ndevelopments in possible-worlds semantics. According to this\nview, our basic modal concepts—necessity, contingency,\npossibility and impossibility—can be defined in\nstraightforwardly non-modal terms. \n\nBut does Leibniz's account of necessity and contingency really\namount to possible-worlds semantics for modality avant la\nlettre? While Leibniz had all the tools at his disposal to\ndevelop such an account of modality, he did not, or, at least, he did\nnot do so explicitly in any texts. Rather, his account of the\nnature of necessity and contingency has more to do with his account of\nthe nature of truth and the analysis of propositions. More\nspecifically, it has to do with his doctrine of infinite\nanalysis. In his piece On Contingency,\nLeibniz writes, \n\nIn other words, a proposition is necessary (or expresses a necessary\ntruth) if, in analyzing it, one arrives at a statement of\nidentities. A simple example can be found in arithmetic:\n“2+2 = 4.” Since “2 = 1+1” and “4 =\n1+1+1+1”, we can easily show that the original statement can be\nreduced to “1+1+1+1 = 1+1+1+1.” Here we have an\nobvious case of an identity and one where we can say that the concept\nof the predicate – in this case, “4” – is\ncontained is contained in the subject, “2+2” (or\n“(1+1) + (1+1)”). \n\nIt should be clear that Leibniz's definition of what is\nnecessary will be adopted by Kant, but Kant will call\nthis analytic. (On the other hand, Kant famously rejects\nthe idea that the arithmetic statement given above (or any arithmetic\nstatement) is analytic. Although this is a topic of some\ncontroversy, the majority of jurors have a returned a verdict in favor\nof Leibniz's classificatory scheme and against that of Kant.) \n\n A\ntrue proposition that is contingent is one in which it can\nnever be demonstrated that the subject and predicate terms are\nreducible to identities. Indeed, according to Leibniz, the\nanalysis of these concepts can be carried on to infinity. While\nthis might seem vague, Leibniz often compares the distinction between\nnecessary and contingent truths to rational and irrational numbers. \n\nAlthough “infinite analysis” might still seem a rather\nelusive idea, the driving thought should not be so difficult.\nThe reason for any contingently true proposition is to be\nfound in another contingently true proposition, and this chain of\nreasons goes back ultimately to the creation of the world (or rather to\nGod's free choice of this particular world). We,\nwith our finite minds, are not able to grasp this chain of reasons, but\nGod can do so. \n\nLeibniz's definition of a possibility is simply a\nproposition that can be shown to be such that a contradiction will\nnever arise in its analysis. (A VI iv 758/LLP 61) And an\nimpossibility, not surprisingly, is defined as a proposition that can\nbe demonstrated to generate a contradiction in its analysis. \n\nIt was claimed above that Leibniz does not explicitly adopt the kind of\npossible-worlds semantics endorsed by Lewis and others in his own\ndefinitions and explanations of our basic modal concepts. But it\nis easy to show that Leibniz's account of these modal concepts\ncan be translated into the now standard possible-worlds\nsemantics. Consider the way Leibniz distinguishes necessary and\ncontingent truths in §13 of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics. \n\nAnd, slightly later, discussing Julius Caesar's crossing of\nthe Rubicon (and predicate “crosses the Rubicon” in the\nconcept of Caesar), Leibniz writes the following: \n\nThe crucial idea here is that a proposition is contingently true in\nthis world when it is somehow dependent upon the first free decree of\nGod, that is, when the reason for the truth of the\nproposition is to be located in the actualization of this\nparticular world. There is another world, W*, existing in the\ninfinite library of world-books, which is such that if God\nhad brought that world, W*, into existence P would\nbe false. In other words, a proposition is contingently true when it\nis true in that world and false in some other world. As mentioned\nabove, however, Leibniz defines a possible proposition in another text\nfrom this period as a proposition which will never result in a\ncontradiction in its analysis, and given his account of worlds, this\nsimply means that the proposition is true in some world. Further,\nsince necessary truths are not dependent upon the first free\ndecree of God but are instead revealed by analysis to be identities,\nthey are in fact propositions that are true in all possible\nworlds. And so, while our basic modal concepts are explained in terms\nof the in-esse doctrine of truth (i.e. the\nPredicate-in-Notion Principle) and the notion of infinite analysis (in\nthe case of contingency), it is a not a great jump to possible-worlds\nsemantics. \n\nIt should probably not be surprising that Leibniz's explication of the\nnature of the distinction between necessary and contingent truths can\nbe translated into the terms of contemporary possible-worlds\nsemantics. For Leibniz tells us in On Freedom (De\nlibertate... 1689?) that he first came to think of the\nnature of possibilia in terms of fictional worlds, worlds\nthat have existence in a somewhat tenuous sense. “But the\nconsideration of possibles, which are not, were not, and will not be,\nbrought me back from this precipice [Spinoza's necessitarianism]. For\nif there are certain possibles that never exist, then the things that\nexist, at any rate, are not always necessary, for otherwise it would\nbe impossible for others to exist in their place, and thus, everything\nthat never exists would be impossible.” (A VI iv\n1653–54/AG 94) It was only later that he began to conceive of\nthe distinction between necessary and contingent truths in terms of\nfinite and infinite analysis. In the end, then, we can say that the\ndoctrine of infinite analysis is dependent upon the doctrine of the\ninfinity of possible worlds. \n\nLeibniz's logical conception of the nature of substance,\naccording to which each individual substance has a concept so complete\nthat it contains all predicates true of it past, present, and future\n(or from which all its predicates are deducible), also seems to push\nhim to endorse a strong version of essentialism. Just\nhow strong this essentialism is has been the subject of debate among\nscholars of Leibniz's thought. \n\nCall essentialism the doctrine that for any individual\nsubstance, x, there is a property P of x\nsuch that, necessarily, if x exists, then x\nhas P.  In other words, there is some property that\nis essential to x.  For example, one could argue that\nhumanity is essential to Caesar; and if Caesar (somehow) were to lose\nthe property of being a human being, Caesar would cease to be\nCaesar. \n\nCall superessentialism the doctrine that for any\nindividual substance, x, and for any\nproperty P of x, necessarily,\nif x exists, then x has P.  In\nother words, every property is essential\nto x.  For example, one might imagine\nthat crosser of the Rubicon or possessor of 12,147 hairs\non his head on the Ides of March, 44 B.C.E. were properties that,\nwere they different, the Caesar of our world would no longer\nexist. (For the sake of argument, assume that the head-hair count is\ntrue; it is only supposed to get at some seemingly trivial property.)\nOr, put differently, if those properties were different, the Caesars\nwould be genuinely different individual substances. \n\nNow, it certainly seems that Leibniz's view is that, indeed,\nevery property of an individual substance is essential to\nit. \n\nThis very point is something that Antoine Arnauld noticed\nimmediately upon reading the Discourse on Metaphysics.\n(More exactly, Arnauld read only what are now usually presented as\nbrief synopses of the individual sections.) As he wrote to\nLeibniz, “Since it is impossible that I should not always have\nremained myself, whether I had married or lived in celibacy,\nthe individual concept of myself contained neither of these\ntwo states; just as it is well to infer: this block of marble is the\nsame whether it be at rest or be moved; therefore neither rest nor\nmotion is contained in its individual concept.” (G II 30)\nArnauld's point is quite simply that the property of being\ncelibate is not essential to him or to his concept\nbecause he would still be Arnauld even if he had married and had\nchildren. \n\nLeibniz's response takes us into some fascinating metaphysical\nterritory. Returning to his original example of Adam and his\nsins, Leibniz writes the following: \n\nI have said that all human events can be deduced not simply by\nassuming the creation of a vague Adam, but by assuming the creation of\nan Adam determined with respect to all these circumstances, chosen from\namong an infinity of possible Adams. This has given Arnauld the\noccasion to object, not without reason, that it is as difficult to\nconceive of several Adams, taking Adam as a particular nature, as it is\nto conceive of several mes. I agree, but when speaking of several\nAdams, I was not taking Adam as a determinate individual. I must\ntherefore explain myself. This is what I meant. When one considers in\nAdam a part of his predicates, for example, that he is the first man,\nset in a garden of pleasure, from whose side God fashioned a woman, and\nsimilar things conceived sub ratione generalitatis, in a\ngeneral way (that is to say, without naming Eve, Paradise, and other\ncircumstances that fix individuality), and when one calls Adam the\nperson to whom these predicates are attributed, all this is not\nsufficient to determine the individual, for there can be an infinity of\nAdams, that is, an infinity of possible persons, different from one\nanother, whom this fits. Far from disagreeing with what Arnauld says\nagainst this multiplicity of the same individual, I myself used this to\nmake it better understood that the nature of an individual must be\ncomplete and determinate. I am even quite convinced of what Saint\nThomas had already taught about intelligences, which I hold to apply\ngenerally, namely, that it is not possible for there to be two\nindividuals entirely alike, or differing only numerically. Therefore,\nwe must not conceive of a vague Adam, that is, a person to whom certain\nattributes of Adam belong, when we are concerned with determining\nwhether all human events follow from his assumption; rather, we must\nattribute to him a notion so complete that everything that can be\nattributed to him can be deduced from it. Now, there is no room for\ndoubting that God can form such a notion of him, or rather that he\nfinds it already formed in the realm of possibles, that is, in his\nunderstanding. \n\n It, therefore, also follows that he would\nnot have been our Adam, but another Adam, had other events happened to\nhim, for nothing prevents us from saying that he would be another.\nTherefore, he is another. (G II 41–42/AG 72–73) \n\nLeibniz's point is that, since the Adam of the actual world (call him\n“Adam@”) has a complete concept containing all\nof his properties and since Adam@ (or any substance)\nexpresses the entire world of which he is a member, Adam@\ncould not exist in a different world. Moreover, if any of\nAdam@'s properties were somehow changed, then the resulting\nbeing would not be Adam@.  This is indeed an important\nconsequence of his Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles. When\nwe speak of the Adam who brought sin into the world and an Adam who\ndid not, we cannot, strictly speaking, be referring to the same\nindividual. And that failure of identical reference is the key to\nseeing that all of Adam's properties are essential to him. Leibniz\nmakes this point about as clearly as he makes any point in §30 of\nthe Discourse on Metaphysics in his discussion of Judas' sin:\n“But someone else will say, why is it that this man will\nassuredly commit this sin? The reply is easy: otherwise he would not\nbe this man.” (A VI iv 1576/AG 61) In other words, Leibniz seems\nto deny the possibility of “transworld-individuals” and\nasserts instead that every individual is “world-bound.”\nNevertheless, Leibniz argues that there are “vague Adams,”\nthat is, quasi-individuals which exist in more than one world. And\nwhen we imagine other possible worlds in which “Adam” does\nnot sin or eats the forbidden donut, we are imagining only an\nincomplete or vague “Adam” who is the individual in that\nworld – not the same individual. That is, the\n“vague Adams” are only quasi-individuals because their\nindividual concepts are not complete. Indeed, when Leibniz speaks of\nthe “vague Adams,” what he has in mind is some set\nproperties that is common to a number of individuals:\nAdam@, Adamw′ (i.e. Adam in\nworld′), Adamw″,\nAdamw′′′, and so on. In the\nterminology of David Lewis's modal theory, they are the\n“counterparts” of Adam in other possible worlds. Strictly\nspeaking, however, only individuals with complete individual concepts\nare denizens of other possible worlds; quasi-individuals per se cannot\nbe said to exist. But an incomplete concept can be used to delimit a\nset of counterparts that do exist with complete individual concepts in\ndifferent possible worlds. And lest it be thought that talk of the\nidea of a “vague Adam” is limited to his discussion in the\n1680s with Arnauld about modal matters, it should be noted that\nLeibniz makes much the same point 20 years later in the concluding\nsections of the\nTheodicy discussed and quoted above when he writes of the\n“several Sextuses” that are to be found in the palace\ncontaining the books of fates. All of this speaks very strongly\nfor attributing the doctrine of superessentialism to Leibniz throughout\nhis life as well as the denial of the doctrine of transworld\nidentity. \n\nBut if we attribute the doctrine of superessentialism to Leibniz, then\nit would seem that there will be a difficulty in distinguishing those\nproperties that traditionally were thought to be essential to an\nindividual and those that were thought to be mere accidents. In\nother words, if all properties are essential, on Leibniz's view,\nis there any difference between his humanity and his\nwearing a fluffy silk shirt on 1 January 1700? Not\nsurprisingly, Leibniz has a solution to this apparent problem. In an\nimportant work on logic from the period of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics and Correspondence with Arnauld, the General\nInquiries about the Analysis of Concepts and of Truths\n(Generales Inquisitiones de Analysi Notionum et Veritatum,\n1686), Leibniz makes the standard, Aristotelian distinction between\nessential properties and accidents, saying “that thing which is\ncalled ‘a man’ cannot cease to be a man except by\nannihilation; but someone can begin or cease to be a king, or learned,\nthough he himself remains the same.” (A VI iv 740/LLP 47) The\nimportant point here is the species to which an individual\nbelongs contributes one level of properties to an individual; but, of\ncourse, these are properties that are held in common by all members of\nthat particular species. Therefore, for example, Adam is not only a\nman, but necessarily also rational and, to use the Aristotelian\nchestnut, a featherless biped. Following Mondadori (1993), let us\ncall being a human being a specific essential\nproperty. But there may also be individuating essential\nproperties, those which single x out from\nthe other members of the same species and which are nevertheless such\nthat, lacking them, x would no longer be\nx. For example, consider several counterpart\nAdams: one who brought no sin into the world, one who did so by eating\nthe forbidden donut, etc. As we have said, they cannot be\nidentical to Adam@, which is another way of saying that\nAdam@ would cease to be Adam@ if he no longer\nbrought sin into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. But now\nconsider a Plantinga-inspired example: the alligator who brought sin\ninto the world. Could the alligator count as a counterpart of\nAdam@? No, for lacking the property of humanity, there are\nsimply no counterparts of Adam@. In support of this view,\nconsider On Freedom, Fate and the Grace of God (De\nlibertate, fato, gratia Dei, 1686/87), where Leibniz first has a\ncritic of his view say that, “God … has in his intellect\na notion or an idea of Peter as perfect as possible containing all\ntruths concerning Peter, the objective reality of which constitutes\nthe complete nature or essence of Peter, and accordingly, to deny is\nessential to Peter and is foreknown by God.” Leibniz's response\nemploys the distinction between necessary and contingent\nproperties: \n\nWhile the first passage seems to be Leibniz's position, he\nactually finesses this view in the second passage. Those\nproperties that are said to be necessary or essential are actually what\nwere called above the specific essential properties.\nThus, Peter's specific essential properties include being a human\nbeing and what follows from that, for example, being rational.\nThe crucial feature of these properties is that their absence\nmeans that the individual would be annihilated entirely; for example,\nif humanity were somehow stripped from Peter's complete\nindividual concept, Peter would cease to exist\ncompletely. Those properties that are said to be\ncontingent or existential are all the myriad properties that\nindividuate Peter and that make Peter the particular person that he\nis. As Leibniz says, they are what fill out Peter's\ncomplete individual concept. Now, these properties can still be\nconsidered essential in the sense relevant to Leibniz's\nsuperessentialism, but in the following way (similar to what was said\nabove about Adam@): if such a property, for example,\ndenying Christ, were stripped from Peter's complete\nindividual concept, Peter would cease to be Peter. In other\nwords, imagine Peter's notion, containing, among other things,\nhumanity, being a disciple of Christ, being the\nfounder of the church, and being a denier of\nChrist. Leibniz's point seems to be that we\ncould peer into a nearby possible world where a\nPeter-counterpart did not deny Christ. But there is no nearby\npossible world in which a Peter was the alligator or marmoset that\ndenied Christ. \n\nIf, however, this is Leibniz's view, then it might seem that\nwe have a problem: the specific essential properties of an individual\nare few; the individuating essential properties are many; and the\nspecific essential properties are in fact so few that they do little\nwork. Yet, it should be emphasized that, for Leibniz, there is\nsomething very important about drawing a line between human beings and\nother animals: we are rational, while they are not; we are capable of\nmorality, while they are not. This view comes out most clearly in\nLeibniz's New Essays, where he is trying to undermine\nLocke's deep anti-essentialism: “as we know the inner\nessence of man, namely reason, which resides in the individual man and\nis present in all men, and as we find among us no fixed inner feature\nwhich generates a subdivision, we have no grounds for thinking that the\ntruth about their inner natures implies that there is any essential\nspecific difference among men.” (A VI, vi, 325–26/RB\n325–26) In other words, there are certain properties within us\nthat necessarily differentiate us from all other species and those that\ndifferentiate us from all other individuals within that species.\nIn this regard, Leibniz is a traditionalist, upholding a real,\nessential distinction between human beings and other creatures.\nYet, insofar as he believes that all properties of an\nindividual are essential to that individual, Leibniz is radical. \n\nIn On Contingency, Leibniz remarks that “there are\ntwo labyrinths of the human mind, one concerning the composition of the\ncontinuum, and the other concerning the nature of freedom, and they\narise from the same source, infinity.” (A VI iv 1654/AG 95)\nSomeone coming upon this passage for the first time might be puzzled by\nLeibniz's claim. Why, after all, should the labyrinth of\nthe nature of freedom be related to infinity? Given our\ndiscussion above concerning contingency and infinite analysis, the\nanswer should be relatively clear.  \n\nLeibniz's account of modality opens the way for him to present a\ndistinctive kind of compatibilist theory of free will. For, according\nto Leibniz, Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon was a free act insofar as\nit spontaneously flowed from his own individual nature or was part of\nhis complete concept and insofar as it represented Caesar's choice of\nwhat he perceived to be the best option for him at the time. This\naction was not necessary – and therefore contingent\n– because its contrary (for example, staying in Gaul) does\nnot imply a contradiction. In saying that there is no contradiction,\nLeibniz means that either property or action – crossing the\nRubicon or remaining in Gaul – could co-exist within a complete\nset of properties of a Caesar. But as we saw above, there are\nsome properties that, were they changed, the individual would cease to\nbe. Thus, for example, it is a fair bet that Caesar was not free to\nbecome a trout. Put differently, we can say that, while Caesar crossed\nthe Rubicon in this world and thus began the Roman Civil\nWars, there is another possible world in which a Caesar\ndid not cross the Rubicon.  (Again, the\n“existence” of the other possible world is meant only to\nimply that there is some set of compossible essences that include the\nCaesar-counterpart who does not cross the Rubicon.)\n \n\nLeibniz's conception of substance, according to which each\nindividual has a complete individual concept, still seems remarkably\nnecessitarian. After all, even predicates related to my\nfuture actions are now contained within my complete individual\nconcept. This smacks of determinism and raises in its own way the\nproblem of future contingents. As mentioned above, Leibniz claims\nthat we are free in part precisely because our actions follow from our\nvery natures with complete spontaneity. But also, according to\nLeibniz, God “inclines our souls without necessitating\nthem.” Indeed, in the Discourse on Metaphysics,\nLeibniz claims that the actions of an individual are certain\nbut not necessary. They are, Leibniz argues, certain ex\nhypothesi—that is, they are certain given the creation or\ninstantiation of this particular world. God saw that Caesar would\ncross the Rubicon, that Judas would betray Christ, that Adam would sin,\nand so on; each of these acts and an infinity of others were included\nin each individual's complete concept; and yet God chose this\nworld in which such actions would certainly take place.\nBut, at the same time, since the contraries of any such actions do not\nimply contradictions, they are not necessary. God, in choosing a\npossible world, chooses all the essences of all the actual individuals,\neach of which has its program, according to which it acts spontaneously\nand freely. While it is still a program or a complete concept, on\nLeibniz's view, that does imply determination.\n \n\nLeibniz is famous for his “optimism,” that is, for the\nthesis that this is the best of all possible worlds. According to\nLeibniz, God surveyed the infinitely many possible worlds,\ndetermined which was best, and instantiated it or made it actual.\nIn an important article, “Theories of Actuality,” Robert\nMerrihew Adams dubs this the “Divine Choice Theory” of\nactuality. In the main article on Leibniz, the reasons for this\nview are presented. But it is important to see that there are\nseveral factors that contribute to God's choice: first, according\nto Leibniz, God chose the world that was simplest in hypotheses (or\nlaws) and richest in phenomena; second, it is claimed that God was\nchiefly concerned with the happiness of minds; third, since (it is\nargued) God sought to have the maximum perspectives on the universe,\nthe world is a plenum, filled with minds each of which expresses the\nworld from its own point of view. \n\nAlthough the Divine Choice Theory does seem to be Leibniz's preferred\nway to explain the origin of this—the actual—world, he\ndoes offer another explanation that deserves comment.  This is the\ndoctrine of striving possibles. According to this view, as\npresented principally in On the Ultimate Origination of\nThings (De rerum originatione radicali, 1697), each\nessence naturally strives for existence, and the actual world is\nsimply the final battlefield after all possible essences have engaged\nin mortal combat for survival. In short, this is metaphysical\nDarwinism, in which the most perfect (and mutually compatible)\nessences survive to constitute a world. Consider the following: \n\nFurthermore, in order to explain a bit more distinctly how temporal,\ncontingent, or physical truths arise from eternal, essential or\nmetaphysical truths, we must first acknowledge that since something\nrather than nothing exists, there is a certain urge for existence or\n(so to speak) a straining toward existence in possible things or in\npossibility or essence itself; in a word, essence in and of itself\nstrives for existence. Furthermore, it follows from this that all\npossibles, that is, everything that expresses essence or possible\nreality, strive with equal right for existence in proportion to the\namount of essence or reality or the degree of perfection they contain,\nfor perfection is nothing but the amount of essence. \n\n From\nthis it is obvious that of the infinite combinations of possibilities\nand possible series, the one that exists is the one through which the\nmost essence or possibility is brought into existence. In practical\naffairs one always follows the decision rule in accordance with which\none ought to seek the maximum or the minimum: namely, one prefers the\nmaximum effect at the minimum cost, so to speak. (G VII 303/AG\n150) \n\nSince the theory of Striving Possibles seems so obviously to\nconflict with the Divine Choice Theory and since the latter is so much\na part of Leibniz's mature system, we seem to have good reason to\nquestion how seriously to take this view. (The classic articles\non this issue are those by Shields and Blumenfeld listed in the\nbibliography.) There is, however, a common way to reconcile the\ntwo views: the Divine Choice Theory literally explains the origin of\nthis world, and the Striving Possibles Theory is merely a\nmetaphor. But a metaphor for what? Answer: for the moral\nevaluation taking place in the divine intellect. In other words,\nGod ought to be understood as surveying not simply all worlds (sets of\ncompossible essences) prior to creation but also, in some sense,\nindividual essences; and those essences which individually are most\nperfect and which collectively can form a world are in fact elected for\nexistence.  \n\nIn conclusion, it has been claimed throughout this piece that\nLeibniz advances his unique views on modality in opposition to the\nviews of Hobbes and Spinoza. In short, the modal metaphysics we\nfind in Leibniz's system is a result of the attempt to combine\nthe insights of a mechanistic (and therefore deterministic) world-view\nwith the demands of orthodox Christianity. There are a number of\nimportant particular points to bring out here. First, on\nSpinoza's view, everything that is possible is actual; that is,\nthere are no unactualized possibilities. To claim that some\nparticular thing or event could have been otherwise or to claim that\nthe world itself could have been otherwise is simply to make an\nassertion without adequate knowledge. Indeed, one of the\ncornerstones of Spinoza's philosophy is the view that, if one has\nknowledge of the third kind, then one will recognize that\neverything happens out of the necessity of the divine\nnature. Second, if the Divine Choice Theory is the preferred\naccount of the origin of this actual world, then Leibniz stands in\nopposition to Spinoza both because the Divine Choice Theory entails the\nexistence of non-actualized possible worlds and also because it clearly\nentails a God that is anthropomorphic and transcendent. In other\nwords, the Divine Choice Theory requires a God in whom intellect and\nwill are distinct. Third, Leibniz's accounts of necessity\nand contingency are, obviously, in service of his commitment to the\nreal freedom of human beings – and this in the face of the\nmechanistic world-view to which he otherwise adhered. This should\nbe in no way surprising because Leibniz, unlike Hobbes and Spinoza,\nupheld the basic tenets of Christianity and had to explain how freedom\nand responsibility could be attributed to an individual, whose very\nnature (following Leibniz's account of truth) entailed all\nproperties, past, present, and future.","contact.mail":"look@uky.edu","contact.domain":"uky.edu"}]
