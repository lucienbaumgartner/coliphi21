Chinese sources\ngenerally identify this development as Xuanxue, or\n“Learning (xue) in the Profound\n(xuan).”\n\n\n“Xuan” literally denotes a shade of black with\ndark red. By extension, it gains a richer meaning connoting what is\nhidden from view or far from reach, especially in the sense of a\nprofound truth that escapes ordinary comprehension, and thus appears\n“dark” or mysterious. In this latter sense, it figures\nprominently in the Laozi (Daodejing). The Dao or\n“Way” is “formless” and\n“nameless,” as the Laozi asserts, and yet it is\nthe “beginning” of “heaven and earth,” and the\nbasis of human flourishing. Indescribably deep and profound, the Dao\ntherefore can only be depicted as dark and hidden, or xuan\n(see especially Laozi, Chapter 1).\n\n\nXuanxue aimed at unlocking the mystery of Dao, and in so\ndoing came to define the early medieval Chinese intellectual scene.\nHowever, it was not a partisan “Daoist” school. As such,\nthe label “Neo-Daoism” is ambiguous and should be treated\nwith care, though it may be convenient and widely used.\nXuanxue harbored a wide range of views. The concept of Dao\nprovided a focus, but it invited diverse interpretation.\nXuanxue arose during a time of political turmoil after the\nfall of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.), when leading\nintellectuals of the succeeding Wei (220–265) and Jin\n(265–420) dynasties interrogated tradition afresh, so as to\narrive at a new blueprint for order. This occasioned intense debates\nand set new directions for the development of Chinese philosophy. The\ndiscussion that follows will set out briefly the context in which\nNeo-Daoism made its mark, and introduce some of its major figures and\ndebates. \n\nAs a proper term, Xuanxue gained currency during the fifth\ncentury C.E. It named a branch of learning that formed a part of the\ncurriculum of the imperial academy. The subject matter of\nXuanxue in this formal sense centered on the Yijing\n(Classic of Changes), the Laozi, the Zhuangzi, and\nselected commentaries on them. These three classical texts were seen\nto hold deep insight into the cosmos and the human condition, and were\nreferred to collectively as the “Three (Great Works on the)\nProfound” (sanxuan). They articulated their vision of\n“grand harmony” and “great peace” through the\nconcept of Dao, which demanded explication. It is precisely the goal\nof Xuanxue, then, to bring to light the nature and function\nof Dao, which may appear dark or impenetrable. \nIn a wider sense, Xuanxue came to describe, retrospectively,\nthe main current of early medieval Chinese philosophy as a whole. This\nis a broad stroke that privileges intellectual unity over diversity.\nHowever, as we will see, family resemblances notwithstanding, there\nare significant differences among individual Xuanxue thinkers\nin their understanding of Dao. Looking back, later historians\ntypically traced the beginnings of Xuanxue to the early third\ncentury C.E. The end of the Han dynasty caused painful disruptions,\nbut it also forced open a space for intellectual renewal. In this\ncontext, the educated elite debated on ways to restore order and\nharmony, based on their interpretation of the teachings of the ancient\nsages and philosophers. The hermeneutical contest was keen, and new\nideas came to the fore through the critical engagement with tradition.\nNevertheless, there was a shared assumption that any blueprint for\nlasting peace and harmony must rest on a clear understanding of Dao,\nwhich provided a point of departure for the unfolding of\nNeo-Daoism. \nWhile Xuanxue was guided by what may be called a keen\n“Dao-centered” consciousness, it was not a Daoist movement\naimed at dismantling the teachings of Confucius. There is also some\ndebate as to whether Neo-Daoism abandoned sociopolitical engagement\nfor a kind of individualistic escapism. These two points warrant\nfurther discussion, which should give a thicker description of the\ncontext in which Neo-Daoism came into play. \nThe close connection between Xuanxue and “Pure\nConversation” (qingtan) is often cited as evidence\npointing to the former’s escapist interests. Pure Conversation\nwas one of the hallmarks of early medieval Chinese literati culture.\nIn its mature form, it found expression in high-minded debates on\ntopical philosophical concerns, such as the relationship between\n“capacity” and “nature” in a person (to be\ndiscussed in Section 5 below). Pure Conversation has been traced to a\nprotest movement against political corruption that erupted toward the\nend of the Han period. The protests were harshly suppressed.\nConsequently, some commentators argue, many intellectuals became\ndisillusioned with the political process. Fearing for their safety\nalso, they turned to, as it were, “purer” pursuits,\nchanneling their creative energy to art and philosophy, away from the\ntreacherous waters of politics. Culturally, they indulged in wine,\ngames, including Pure Conversation, and outlandish behavior that\nseemed to have been designed expressly to upset the status quo.\nExamples of these will be mentioned below. As Xuanxue\ninformed Pure Conversation philosophically, it is therefore charged\nwith having given rein to a spirit of disengagement that took refuge\nin unproductive intellectual exchanges and certain counter-culture\nexpressions. \nNo doubt, many literati in early medieval China found politics to be\nexceedingly corrupt. During this time, eremitic ideals also became\nentrenched in mainstream high culture. Nevertheless, these alone do\nnot afford a full view of the vibrant intellectual landscape. While\nsome scholars had lost faith in the political process, many others\nremained committed to revitalizing the rule of Dao, however it might\nbe defined, and pushed for reforms. While some considered political\ninvolvement distasteful and trained their minds on alternative paths\nof fulfillment such as music and spirituality, others sought to\nreclaim the true teachings of the sages of old, so as to bring about a\nnew sociopolitical awakening. These are not mutually exclusive\npositions, and both sides contributed to the formation of Neo-Daoism.\nIndeed, eremitism in early medieval China seldom translated into\nabandoning the sociopolitical world; in most cases, it signaled\npersonal “purity” or integrity, a highly valued asset if\nnot a precondition for admission to officialdom. Certainly,\nphilosophical debates need not always be about political reforms;\nnevertheless, especially for young scholars aspiring to make a name\nfor themselves in public life, successes at Pure Conversation could\nreap substantial political dividends. As a general intellectual\nmovement, Xuanxue is united in its attempt to illuminate the\n“dark,” to lay bare the profound mystery of Dao, but it\nencompasses a range of responses to the brave new world that was\npost-Han China. \nDuring the heyday of the Han dynasty, the Confucian tradition, as it\nwas interpreted at that time, towered over all the other schools of\nthought. Confidently, it mapped out the structure of the universe and\nthe ways in which the world under heaven ought to be governed. With\nthe decline of the Han dynasty, critiques of Han Confucianism began to\nsurface. To some scholars then, Han Confucianism was not only\npowerless in arresting the growing malaise, but also part of the\nproblem that led to the downfall of the Han dynasty. The critique of\nHan Confucianism, it is important to emphasize, does not necessarily\namount to a rejection of the teachings of Confucius. In fact, with few\nexceptions, Wei-Jin scholars agreed that Confucius was the highest\nsage. It is thus important to clarify that the term\n“Neo-Daoism” does not refer to a kind of\n“anti-Confucius” movement. For the majority of\nXuanxue proponents, Confucius had penetrated completely the\nmystery of Dao; it was the misunderstanding and misappropriation of\nConfucian teachings by Han scholars that created difficulties and thus\nrequired rectification. \nOne key concern was that scholarship had become an avenue for\nemolument, as a result of which self-interest came to outweigh the\nconcern for truth. This in part explains the emphasis on purity in\nearly medieval Chinese literati culture. Furthermore, Han Confucianism\nattempted to forge an “orthodox” front, to explain and put\ninto practice its teachings, and to silence dissent and opposition.\nThe extent of Confucian orthodox control may be open to debate, but\nthere is little question that it sought to exact compliance, which set\nlimits to thought. The classics were restricted to a particular mode\nof interpretation, and non-canonical literature, including Daoist\nworks, were often viewed with suspicion or dismissed outright. In the\ninterest of unity, orthodoxy prescribed closure; but in an age of\ndisunity and disruption, the quest for order charged through\nintellectual barriers with emancipatory fervor. \nDuring the Han period, commentaries emerged as the principal medium of\nphilosophic discourse. Methodologically, Han commentaries emphasized\ndetailed explanation of individual words and phrases of the classics.\nThis necessitated heavy specialization, which heightened virtuosity\nbut also opened the door for vain scholastic display and fragmentation\nof learning. One of the most important debates in Xuanxue\nconfronts directly the question of interpretation, which brought\nhermeneutics to the forefront of Chinese philosophy. More will be said\nabout this debate later. \nIn this context, a first wave of Xuanxue philosophers arrived\non the scene. They were the brightest of their age, many of whom\nhailed from distinguished families who had held high office for\ngenerations. They were concerned with restoring unity and harmony to\nthe land, not by repudiating the teachings of the sages but by\ninterpreting them anew. They discerned that the great teachers of old\nsuch as Confucius and Laozi shared a profound understanding of Dao,\nand for this reason, the highly partisan approach of Han Confucianism\ncould not but lead to grave misunderstanding of the sage enterprise.\nIn response, they devised new commentarial strategies and fashioned\nnew genres of philosophical discourse, especially the lun,\ncritical discussions, essays or disquisitions that focus on particular\ntopics, which often elicited refutations and in turn, rejoinders. Some\nexamples of this will be discussed in the sections that follow. \nOn this view, Confucius and Laozi were both “Daoists,” in\nthe non-partisan sense of the term. Neo-Daoist philosophers set forth\nthe truth of Dao as they understood it in a broad synthesis, bringing\ntogether ontology, cosmology, ethics, and political philosophy, and\nbreaking down partisan divides along the way. Convinced of the unity\nof the classics, they attempted to provide an integral account of the\none “Daoist” tradition. Crossing swords in debate,\ncompeting in offering new readings of the classics, reacting against\nand influenced by one another—in this crisscrossing of ideas,\nXuanxue flourished. \nTranslating the term Xuanxue remains a challenge. In view of\nthe ambiguity of “Neo-Daoism,” “Dark Learning”\nhas been proposed as an alternative. This is also not entirely\nsatisfactory. Even if it is clear that “dark” does not\nconnote something sinister, it is still problematic because while the\nsubject of the inquiry appears dark or inaccessible to understanding,\nthere is nothing mysterious about the inquiry itself. Innovative and\nabstract in some respects, Xuanxue is nonetheless committed\nto analytic rigor and clarity in explicating the meaning of Dao. The\nculture of disputation has deep roots in Chinese history, and rigorous\ndebates on the classics became prevalent during the Han period, which\nfueled the development of Neo-Daoist philosophy. \nCritics of Xuanxue condemned it as “dark,”\nbecause they judged it to be obfuscating and detrimental to the\nflourishing of the Way. They would use phrases like “dark\nwords” (xuanyan) or “dark talk”\n(xuantan) in a pejorative sense, indicating that to them\nXuanxue was nothing but empty talk, convoluted, mystifying\nand misguided. In these contexts, “xuan” may be\ntranslated as “abstruse,” “obscure,” or words\nto that effect. What this suggests is that uniform translation without\nregard to context might be ill advised. Grammatically the word\nxuan functions as a noun in “Xuanxue.”\nPerhaps “Learning in the Profound,” “Learning of the\nMysterious Dao,” “Inquiry into the Profound” or\nsimilar renderings may be considered, though they seem rather\nbulky. \nAs Xuanxue philosophy is seen to offer a fresh approach to\nunderstanding the nature and function of Dao, it has come to be called\nxin daojia (literally, new school of Daoist thought) in some\nmodern Chinese studies, or “Neo-Daoism” in English\ntranslation. In the pages that follow, the terms Xuanxue and\nNeo-Daoism will be used interchangeably in a general sense, as a\nbroad, dynamic intellectual front that flourished during early\nmedieval China, as opposed to a homogeneous “school” with\nset doctrines. In modern Chinese, Xuanxue is also taken to\nrefer to astrology, geomancy and other popular religious arts, which\nfall outside the scope of this discussion. \nAmong the first wave of Neo-Daoist philosophers, He Yan (ca.\n207–249) and Wang Bi (226–249) are often singled out by\nlater scholars as having laid the foundation of the new Learning in\nthe Profound. According to the Jin shu (History of the Jin\nDynasty), He Yan, Wang Bi, and some of their contemporaries set forth\nthe meaning of Laozi and Zhuangzi, and established\nthe view that all beings “have their roots in nothingness\n(wu),” which not only “originates things”\nbut also “completes affairs.” As the Jin shu goes\non to relate, wu is that which the yin and yang qi,\nvital forces or “energies,” depend on in their creative\ntransformation, that which all beings depend on in acquiring their\nform, and that which the morally worthy depend on in acquiring their\nvirtuous character (Chapter 43). This furnishes a helpful starting\npoint for a reconstruction of Xuanxue philosophy. \nHe Yan was one of the leading intellectual figures of the early third\ncentury, a trend setter on the cultural front, and one of the most\ninfluential in government. Wang Bi was very much a\nprotégé of He Yan. A widely reported story, for example,\nhas He Yan declaring that Wang Bi was one of those rare individuals\nwith whom one could discuss the most profound truths about the cosmos\nand human affairs (e.g., see Sanguo zhi [Records of the Three\nStates] 28). \nBoth He Yan and Wang Bi were known for their expertise in the\nYijing. Both were deeply interested in the Laozi.\nWang Bi’s Laozi and Yijing commentaries\noccupied an esteemed place in the formal Xuanxue curriculum,\nand arguably they remain the most important philosophical treatment of\nthe two classics today. However, it should be noted that both He Yan\nand Wang Bi wrote on the Confucian Lunyu (Analects)\nas well. Through their extant writings, we gain a good view of the\nmain contours of Xuanxue philosophy. \nThe Jin shu account cited above identifies the concept of\nwu as the locus of Xuanxue. The concept plays a\ncritical role in the Laozi and has been translated variously\nas “nonbeing,” “nothing,” or\n“nothingness.” In classical Chinese, wu generally\nconveys the sense of “not having” something—e.g.,\n“not having a name” (wu ming)—and functions\nas the opposite of “you,” “having”\nsomething. In the Laozi, it is used as an abstract noun as\nwell. Specifically, the Laozi states that wu is the\nsource of all beings (Chapter 40) and the basis of all functions\n(Chapter 11). \nTo He Yan and many of his contemporaries, there is little doubt that\nthe meaning of Dao is to be sought in the concept of wu; but,\nit does not follow that they all understood the latter in the same\nway. The translation of the term wu will need to reflect the\nparticular interpretation in question. In this section, the discussion\non He Yan and Wang Bi will focus on their understanding of Dao as\nwu and its practical implications. \nHe Yan’s writings exist mainly in fragments today. The most\nimportant are (1) his commentary to the Lunyu, which was,\nhowever, a collective effort jointly submitted to the throne with\nseveral other scholars, and (2) quotations from two of his essays\nentitled Wuming lun (Critical Discussion on the Nameless) and\nDao lun (Critical Discussion on Dao) preserved in later\nsources. In the former of the two essays, He Yan explicitly defines\nthe Dao as wu. In the latter, the Dao lun, there is\na fuller discussion of the meaning of nothingness: \nBeings depend on wu in coming into existence, in becoming\nwhat they are. Affairs on account of wu come to fruition and\nbecome what they are. Now, one tries to speak about wu, but\nno words could describe it; name it, but it has no name; look at it,\nbut it does not have any form; listen to it, but it does not give any\nsound. Then, indeed, it is clear that the Dao is complete\n(quan). Thus, it can bring forth sounds and echoes; generate\nqi energies and things; establish form and spirit; and\nilluminate light and shadows. What is dark obtains its blackness from\nit; what is plain obtains its whiteness from it. The carpenter’s\nsquare is able to make a square because of it; the compass is able to\nmake a circle because of it. The round and the square obtain their\nform, but that which gives them their form itself does not have any\nform. The white and the black obtain their name, but that which gives\nthem their name itself does not have any name. \nFew scholars in early medieval China would question the general\nassertion that the Dao is the “beginning” and\n“mother” of all things, as the Laozi puts it\n(Chapter 1). There was also widespread acknowledgement of the\nnamelessness and formlessness of Dao. After all, as the opening words\nof the Laozi famously proclaim, “The Dao that can be\nspoken of is not the constant Dao.” The real issue is how can\nthat which transcends language and perception be said to be the\ncreative source of all beings? \nAccording to He Yan, the solution to the mystery of Dao lies in\nrecognizing its “completeness” or undifferentiated\nwholeness (quan). Precisely because the Dao is whole and\ncomplete, it is able to bring forth heaven and earth and the myriad\ncreatures. For the same reason, in its undifferentiated fullness the\nDao does not have any particular form, and as such cannot be pinned\ndown conceptually and named. Even the term “Dao,” as the\nLaozi makes clear, is but a metaphor, a “forced”\neffort to reference a reality that is ultimately ineffable (Chapter\n25). He Yan stresses the same point in his “Critical Discussion\non the Nameless”: “The Dao [i.e., what the word\n‘Dao’ seeks to point to] fundamentally has no name. Thus,\nLaozi said he could only force a name on it.” \nPut differently, the Dao can only be described as wu because\nit does not have any distinguishable feature or property\ncharacteristic of things. On this reading, wu does not\nsignify ontological absence, but on the contrary attests to the\nfullness and fecundity of the Dao. More precisely, through a process\nof differentiation, the Dao generates the yin and yang qi\nthat constitute all phenomena. The Laozi has also made the\npoint that the Dao is “undifferentiated and complete”\n(Chapter 25). This is now shown to be the source of the yin and yang\nqi—vital forces, pneumas, or loosely,\n“energies”—that engender, shape and sustain life. In\nthis respect, He Yan adhered generally to the yin-yang cosmological\ntheory established since the Han dynasty. Viewed in this light, the\nnothingness of Dao has important implications for ethics and political\nphilosophy. \nUnder the qi theory, all things are constituted by a\nparticular measure, both quantitative and qualitative, of the yin and\nyang qi energies. For example, heaven is constituted by a\nparticularly clear and refined form of qi, whereas the\nsolidity of earth reflects its “heavier” qi\ncomposition. For human beings, each person has been endowed with an\nallotment of qi from birth, which informs his or her inborn\n“nature” (xing). In traditional Chinese terms,\nthe qi endowment of an individual may be “thick”\nor “thin.” How this is understood bears directly on the\nconception of the ideal ethical or spiritual life and political\ncommunity. \nHe Yan affirms in his Lunyu commentary that the inborn\n“xing-nature is that which human beings have been\nendowed with, and which enables them to live” (5.13). This is to\nbe understood in terms of qi, which also accounts for a\nperson’s “capacity” (cai) (commentary to\nLunyu 15.29). In this context, the concept of cai is\ngiven a wide remit, encompassing the full range of talent and ability\nsuch as physical endowment, intelligence, and emotional and moral\ncapacity. Xuanxue scholars debated hotly on the relationship\nbetween a person’s nature and capacity, of which more will be\nsaid later. \nThe height of ethical and spiritual attainment is, of course,\nrepresented by the figure of the sage. To He Yan, the sage is\nprecisely someone who is gifted with an exceptionally fine and rich\nqi endowment, which enables him to “merge with the\nvirtue of heaven and earth” (commentary to Lunyu 14.35\nand 16.8). This follows the language of the Yijing and\nintroduces a political dimension, for the virtue of heaven and earth\nbrings about communal flourishing. Nevertheless, the underlying\nassumption remains that “sagehood” rests on a special\ninborn sage nature that finds expression in optimal capacity on all\nfronts. This also means that “sageness” cannot be acquired\nthrough learning or effort; in other words, sages are born, not\nmade. \nHe Yan is noted for his view that the sage “does not experience\npleasure and anger, or sorrow and joy” (Sanguo zhi 28,\ncommentary). Later scholars have taken this to mean more generally\nthat the sage “does not have emotions” (wuqing).\nHowever, this does not imply that the sage lacks the capacity to\ngenerate cognitive and affective responses. In He Yan’s\ninterpretation, the nature of the sage is ultimately modeled on that\nof the Dao. Given that the Dao embodies the fullness of qi,\nconceptually it should be evident that the sage cannot be lacking in\nany way. The exceptional qi constitution of the sage means\nthat his nature, like that of the Dao, is also undifferentiated and\ncomplete. As such, the sage is never partial or affected by phenomena;\nuntouched by affective interests, his mind is always clear and\ntranquil, free from doubt and emotional disturbances. Consequently, on\nthe political level, he is able to govern with impartiality, provide\nfor the people with his profound virtue, establish lasting order and\nusher in the perfect reign of great peace. \nThis is an ideal construct. It may be logically coherent or even\ncompelling, a mark of philosophical distinction prized by\nPure-conversation connoisseurs, but what real bearing does it have on\npolitics and government? Sages—fantastic individuals born with a\nsage nature on He Yan’s view—are obviously rare. If\nsagehood is not a genuine ethical option that can be achieved through\nlearning and effort, a new model needs to be found. Logically,\nattention should then turn to “worthy” individuals like\nYan Hui, the gifted and cherished disciple of Confucius, who is\n“close to the way of the sage” (commentary to\nLunyu 11.19). \nHowever, Yan Hui is also a special case, whose accomplishments are\nthemselves quite extraordinary (e.g., commentary to Lunyu\n6.3) and reflect a superior qi endowment. Only a select few,\nin other words, can hope to match the attainment of Yan Hui. This in\neffect marks out a separate class of exceptional individuals, the true\nelite, so to speak, whose inborn capacity far surpasses that of the\ncommon people and therefore should be entrusted with the task of\ngovernment. Fair-minded and intellectually gifted, such individuals\nare also able to identify the right talent for public office, which\nwould ensure the proper functioning of sociopolitical processes on a\nsustained basis. Capacity is a function of qi, and just as\none grows hot under the collar when angry or turns pale in moments of\nfear, the idea is that one’s qi constitution can be\ndiscerned by the expert, especially by looking into the person’s\neyes. Once it is understood that the nothingness of Dao reflects the\nfullness of qi, a clear view of the cosmos and the human\ncondition emerges, on the basis of which renewed peace and harmony may\nthen be realized.  \nTogether with He Yan, Wang Bi helped set the course of Neo-Daoist\nphilosophy. Although they shared similar philosophical concerns and\nwere close socially and politically, it should not be assumed that\nthey approached the mystery of Dao in the same way. \nWang Bi was a prolific scholar. Before his untimely death at the age\nof twenty-three, he had already completed a major commentary each on\nthe Yijing and the Laozi, two shorter interpretive\nessays on them, and a work on the Lunyu. This last,\nunfortunately, has not survived except for about fifty quotations,\ncited chiefly in Huang Kan’s (488–545) comprehensive\nLunyu commentary. \nLike He Yan, Wang Bi focuses on the concept of\n“nothingness” (wu) in his explication of Dao. For\nHe Yan, the nothingness of Dao bespeaks its undifferentiated fullness.\nWang Bi, however, holds a different view. The argument from\nDao’s completeness cannot explain fully the mystery of Dao,\naccording to Wang. This is because it fails to resolve the problem of\ninfinite regress. If the chain of beings were to be traced to a\nspecific agent or entity, the origin of the latter must itself be\nquestioned. What gives rise to the category of beings cannot be a\nbeing, no matter how powerful or fecund, with or without\ndifferentiated features. Taken to its logical conclusion, the argument\ncannot be that wu marks the incomparable being of the Dao;\nrather, as Wang Bi states explicitly, “Dao” serves but as\n“the designation of wu” (commentary to\nLunyu 7.6, cf. commentary to Laozi 25). \nThe genesis of the cosmos certainly cannot be understood apart from\nDao, but it is not the work of a primordial being or substance. As a\nlinguistic representation, a metaphor in effect, “Dao”\nbrings up the image of a great thoroughfare of life, from which all\nbeings arise, but it does not entail an objective referent. The\nformlessness and namelessness of Dao signals a deeper reality. To\nbring to light the profound mystery of Dao, reflection must venture\nbeyond the conceptual confines of what may be called an ontology of\nqi to discern the logic of wu. \nThe Laozi asserts that “Dao gives birth to one,”\nwhich produces “two,” and in turn the myriad beings\n(Chapter 42). Whereas commentators from the Han period onward\ngenerally identified the “one” with the original\nqi that generated the yin and yang vital forces—the\n“two”—at the beginning of time, Wang Bi may be said\nto have effected a paradigm shift in redirecting attention to the\nlogical ground of the multiplicity and diversity of beings. \nAs Wang Bi understands it, “beginning” is not a temporal\nreference but signifies logical priority. It is true that\n“two” would be inconceivable without “one,”\nbut this is a conceptual relation not to be reduced to a hierarchy of\nsubstances or vital forces (commentary to Laozi 42, drawing\nfrom Zhuangzi, Chapter 2). Dao constitutes the absolute\nbeginning in that all beings have causes and conditions which in the\nend must logically derive from a single source; but, like\n“Dao,” “one” remains a symbol and does not\nreference any original substance or agent. Significantly, as Wang Bi\nmakes the point in both his Yijing and Laozi\ncommentaries, in this sense “one” is not a number\nbut that which makes possible all numbers and functions. In the latter\n(commentary to Laozi 39), Wang defines “one” as\n“the beginning of numbers and the ultimate of things.” In\nthe former (commentary to Appended Remarks, Part I), he writes,\n“In the amplification of the numbers of heaven and earth [in\nYijing divination] … ‘one’ is not used.\nBecause it is not used, use [of the others] is made possible; because\nit is not a number, numbers are made complete. This indeed is the\ngreat ultimate of change.” \n“All things in the world are born of something (you);\nsomething is born of nothing (wu),” according to the\nLaozi (Chapter 40). How this is interpreted defines the\napproach to Dao by individual Xuanxue scholars. Wang\nBi’s view is that Dao is not a nameless and formless something\nof which nothing can be said. Dao or Way indeed gives the sense that\nall beings are derived from the same source, but it points ultimately\nto that which is other than being, wu\n(“not-being”), a conceptually necessary basis of being. In\nthis way, the mystery of Dao, that it is both nothing and responsible\nfor everything, may be explained. \nThis does not invalidate the yin-yang cosmological theory, which does\nyield important insight into the workings of nature and society.\nNevertheless, cosmology cannot lay bare the highest Daoist truth, with\nwhich the sages of old were principally concerned. In Wang Bi’s\nreworking, wu emerges as a higher-order concept that accounts\nfor the coming to be of qi and all qi-constituted\nphenomena. On He Yan’s reading, it would be appropriate to speak\nof “the Dao,” with the definite article; but in Wang\nBi’s interpretation, Dao is entirely symbolic and any attempt at\nreification must be resisted. This affirms the radical transcendence\nor otherness of Dao as wu. At the same time, by means of the\nconcept of “one,” Wang maintains also the unity of the\nDaoist world, without having to resort to the language of time and\nbeing. The idea of a single “root” of existence holds\nimportant practical implications. \nIf Dao is by definition what being is not, how is it related to the\nworld? The concept of “one” points in the general\ndirection, but it requires corroboration. The concept of li,\ndeep pattern or principle, plays an important role in helping to\nbridge the conceptual divide between transcendence and immanence in\nWang Bi’s philosophy. \nDao has its “great constancy,” as Wang observes, which\nfinds expression in li (commentary to Laozi 47).\nWhat this means is that the Daoist origin and structure of the world\nis seen to entail an inherent order. The plenitude of nature and the\nregularity of the seasons, for example, both attest to the presence of\nDao in the world, not as primary substance, and still less a supreme\ndeity, but as pristine order or coherence marked by intelligible\npatterns of change and principles of operation. This is the underlying\nassumption for the claim that Dao not only originates things but also\nnurtures and completes them, and that Dao is not only the beginning\nbut also the “mother” of all beings (commentary to\nLaozi 1, 51 and 52). \nThe world is characterized by ceaseless change and transformation,\nwhich at first glance may appear haphazard; but as the Yijing\nhas shown, change conforms to basic principles—not static\nmetaphysical “forms,” but dynamic modes of\noperation—that can be described generally in terms of the\ninterplay between the yin and yang vital forces. In this sense, the\nLaozi remarks that human beings are “modeled”\nafter heaven and earth, and ultimately, after Dao (commentary to\nLaozi 25). \nOf course, Dao properly understood as wu is not a something\nthat can be modeled after, but as li, it points to an\nintrinsic order that constitutes and regulates all beings and\nfunctions. To Wang Bi, in short, both the Yijing and the\nLaozi realize that things and affairs follow certain\nli such as the cycle of growth and decay, and more\nimportantly that the manifold patterns and principles governing the\nuniverse, like the branches of a tree, all stem from a single, unified\n“root.” For this reason, in interpreting the\nYijing, Wang emphasizes that the meaning of a hexagram is to\nbe sought in one line, as opposed to all the six lines that make up\nthe hexagram. The technical detail of Wang Bi’s Yijing\nlearning cannot be pursued here, but we will come back to the metaphor\nof “root and branches” shortly. \nLi-principle, “one,” and wu thus form a\nconceptual cluster, which from different angles shed light on the\nseemingly dark or indecipherable truth of Dao. They inform not only\nthe conception of the order of nature but also that of the self and\nsociety. \nHuman beings are of course formed by qi, which may entail\ndifferent capacity. Wang Bi, like his contemporaries, recognizes that\na person’s qi endowment may be “thick” or\n“thin” (commentary to Lunyu 17.2). However, what\nis more important is that beyond the differences in capacity, all are\nequally endowed with a Dao-centered nature, an internal li of\norder and harmony that tends toward stillness at its innermost\ndepth. \nThis follows from the analysis of Dao as wu and\n“one,” which strips away the many disquieting layers of\nhuman artificiality and desire to arrive at a tranquil core. This is a\nkey assumption. “One,” as the logical basis of the\n“many,” according to Wang, signifies also what is of the\nbarest minimum (commentary to Laozi 22), which in this\ncontext translates into a view of human nature that has basic needs\nbut little desire in its original, pristine condition. The language\nhere is novel, though the general idea is already present in the\nConfucian Liji (Record of Rites): “When human beings\nare born, they are tranquil; this is the nature of [human beings\nendowed by] heaven.” \nFrom Wang Bi’s perspective, heaven forms a part of the Daoist\nworld, is itself derivative of the transformation of qi, and\ntherefore cannot be identified as the ultimate source of human nature.\nFurther, because Dao has no objective referent, it cannot be said that\nhuman nature is made in the image of a “creator” or\nderived from any external source. This necessitates an\n“inward” turn in fathoming the roots of human nature.\nConsequently, according to Wang Bi, human nature in its original,\npristine form can only be understood to be “so of itself”\n(ziran). \nThe concept of ziran is critical to Neo-Daoist philosophy and\nis usually translated as “naturalness” or\n“spontaneity.” Commenting on the well-known statement in\nthe Laozi that “Dao models after ziran,”\nWang Bi is careful not to reify what is properly conceptual:\n“Ziran is a term [that we use] to speak of that which\nhas no designation; it is an expression that seeks to lay bare [the\nmeaning of] the ultimate” (commentary to Laozi 25). \nHuman nature so conceived may be described metaphorically as being\nlike a plain block of wood (pu) that has not been carved into\na functional or ornamental object, or it may be articulated\nself-referentially as what is “genuine” or\n“authentic” (zhen) of the person (e.g.,\ncommentary to Laozi 16 and 28). However, these remain\nexpedient markers pointing to the truth of ziran, of what is\n“self-so,” understood as being rooted in a conceptually\nnecessary ontological foundation that the ancient sages aptly\ndescribed as Dao. \nThe analysis of human nature bears directly on ethics and political\nphilosophy. At the ethical level, Wang Bi could not but disagree with\nHe Yan on the issue of the nature of the sage. Rather than seeing the\nsage as an exceptional individual blessed with an extraordinary\nqi endowment that effectively renders him a different kind of\nbeing, who by nature is unaffected by any differentiated emotions such\nas pleasure and anger that are inherently partial, as He Yan does,\nWang Bi argues that the sage is the same as ordinary men and women in\nexperiencing the full range of emotions. \nHowever, there is one decisive difference between the sage and the\ncommon person. While the sage responds to phenomena intellectually and\nemotionally like everyone else, he is not burdened or enslaved by them\nbecause of his “spirit-like perspicacity”\n(shenming). \nIf there is a fundamental unity to all beings, it cannot be maintained\nthat a select few are exempted from the rule. Given the premise that\nall are endowed with a Dao-centered nature, the difference between the\nsage and the average person cannot be one of kind but only of degree\nand attainment. Moreover, He Yan’s thesis would rule out the\npossibility of becoming a sage; indeed, even becoming a “near\nsage” like Yan Hui would be beyond the reach of most people. As\nsuch, how can the sage serve as a source of inspiration and\nmotivation? This may be the main point of contention that sets He Yan\nand Wang Bi apart. \nThe sage is not without sorrow and joy; even Confucius, the highest\nsage, could not but be pleased when he met Yan Hui or be saddened by\nhis untimely passing. Yet, the sage realizes that human emotions are\nultimately driven by self-interest. Precisely because of his affective\nresponsiveness, the sage is able to understand and empathize with the\nneeds of the people; but because of his “spirit-like\nperspicacity”—that is, his heightened spirituality and\nprofound understanding of the nature of things—his mind remains\nperfectly clear like a polished mirror and unburdened by emotional\nattachments. It is logically invalid, as Wang astutely observes, to\nconclude from the absence of attachments to the absence of emotions\n(Sanguo zhi 28, commentary). \nThe way to sagehood does not lie in suppressing one’s emotions\nor in any artificial means, but in abiding by the order of\nziran, in staying true to one’s “root,”\none’s Dao-centered nature. The “authenticity” of the\nsage entails that he is naturally simple like “uncarved\nwood,” which is also to say that he is free from the dictates of\ndesire. In this sense, Wang Bi speaks of the sage as embracing\n“emptiness and quiescence” (e.g., commentary to\nLaozi 16), or as having returned to a state of\n“emptiness and nothingness” (commentary to Laozi\n48). In this same sense, Wang asserts in a celebrated dialogue with\nPei Hui, another senior intellectual figure at that time, that\nalthough Confucius did not speak about wu explicitly, he\nnonetheless embodied it in his every word and action (Sanguo\nzhi 28, commentary, and Shishuo xinyu [New Accounts of\nthe Tales of the World] 4.8). The crucial hermeneutical point here is\nthat “it”—“nothingness”—does not\nrefer to any object or substance; once the nature of Dao is\nunderstood, the embodiment of wu can only mean the\nrealization of ziran. \nThis is also how Wang Bi understands the concept of wuwei,\noften translated as “nonaction,” which figures centrally\nin the Laozi and appears also in the Lunyu, where it\nis associated with no less a personage than the sage-king Shun (15.5).\nLike other central philosophical concepts in the Chinese tradition,\nthe meaning of wuwei is contested and requires careful\ncontextual delineation. In the case of Wang Bi, wuwei serves\nto bring out the meaning of ziran in practice. Thus,\ncommenting on the claim in Laozi 37 that “Dao is\nconstantly wuwei,” Wang simply states, “This\nmeans following ziran.” \nAs applied to the sage, who is “one” with Dao in the sense\nthat he is always true to his calm and tranquil nature, wuwei\nmanifests itself in a life of guileless simplicity and a profound\nunderstanding of the principles governing the Daoist universe.\nNaturally, the sage dwells in quietude and does not engage in\nsuperfluous activity, for which reason the term\n“wuwei,” which conveys the sense of “not\ntaking action,” is used. It would be inconceivable, for example,\nto have a true sage indulging in gossip or slander. Moreover, there is\na qualitative dimension to wuwei, in that every action of the\nsage will accord fully with the principles of nature, without any\ntrace of artificiality or arbitrariness. As applied to the common\npeople, wuwei poses an ethical challenge, which demands doing\nless of the many needless activities that cloud their hearts and\nminds, corrupt their nature, and in the end only serve to perpetuate\nthe tyranny of desire. To those who aspire to walk in the footsteps of\nthe sages, then, wuwei should be understood as a process of\n“returning” to one’s “root,” that is to\nsay, a spiritual and ethical journey to recovering one’s\npristine Dao-centered nature. \nThe order of ziran pervades all spheres of life and activity.\nEthics and political philosophy, in other words, proceed from the same\nlogical ground. At the sociopolitical level, both the family and the\nstate are seen to have a basis in the natural order of things.\nFurthermore, just as the mind commands the body, ideally the family\nand the state should be led by a single sovereign. Given the analysis\nof Dao as “one” and principle, Wang Bi is thus committed\nto defending not only the institution of the family and the state, but\nalso the hierarchical structure of sociopolitical relations. In this\nway, new Daoist insight comes to illuminate concerns typically\nassociated with Confucian philosophy, sweeping aside any partisan\nobstacles along its path. \nIn theory, wuwei aims at preserving the order of\nziran so that the myriad things and affairs can flourish and\nattain their proper end. In practice, the politics of wuwei\nmay be contrasted with Legalist policies that emphasize thorough\npolitical control through reward and especially punishment. The role\nof the ruler, like that of the father, entails great responsibility.\nWhile wuwei naturally has no room for, say, heavy taxation or\nexcessive conscript labor for war or palace construction, it should\nnot exclude appropriate public works like irrigation or services like\ncaring for the sick. Such action would be deemed in alignment with the\nperceived order of nature. Obviously, they are not carried out to\nenhance the ruler’s reputation or interests. The ruler who\ngoverns with wuwei may appear to be doing nothing, but in\nguiding the people to return to their original nature he establishes a\nfirm foundation for great peace. The state would prosper of its own\naccord, as it were, if only the ruler could remain steadfast in\nfollowing the way of “emptiness and quiescence.” The logic\nof nothingness, perhaps unexpectedly, reaches an idealistic end. In\nsum, as Wang Bi concludes in his shorter essay on the Laozi,\nthe key to the Daoist vision lies in “honoring the root and\ncalming the branches,” which ensures that the people are not\nalienated from their true nature and thus able to find fulfillment\n(also see commentary to Laozi 38, 57 and 58). \nDuring the second half of the third century, a group of intellectuals,\nremembered fondly in Chinese sources as the “Seven Worthies of\nthe Bamboo Grove” (zhulin qixian), came to represent\nthe voice of the Learning in the Profound. They are: Ji Kang\n(223–262, or 224–263), Ruan Ji (210–263), Xiang Xiu\n(ca. 227–280), Shan Tao (205–283), Liu Ling (ca.\n221–300), Wang Rong (234–305), and Ruan Xian (nephew of\nRuan Ji, dates unknown but perhaps slightly older than Wang Rong).\nAlthough the term “bamboo grove” has a particular Buddhist\nreference, it probably refers to bamboo fields in or near Ji\nKang’s estate in Shanyang (modern Henan province), where the\ngroup and their associates gathered in pleasure and friendship. Of the\nseven, Ji Kang, Ruan Ji, and Xiang Xiu are of particular interest to\nstudents of philosophy. The first two will be introduced here. \nJi Kang cuts a striking figure in the history of Chinese philosophy. A\nbrilliant musician and poet, a master of Pure Conversation, an\niconoclast and a model of integrity, Ji Kang was the undisputed leader\nof the Seven Worthies and one of the most influential intellectuals of\nhis age. He was unfortunately caught in the web of power struggles and\nwas sentenced to death. Several thousand students of the imperial\nacademy reportedly petitioned for his release. Before the execution,\nas traditional sources further relate, Ji remained perfectly composed;\nas the final hour approached, he asked for a qin (string\ninstrument, commonly translated as zither or lute) and gave a final\nperformance, lamenting only that the tune he played would now die with\nhim (e.g., see Jin shu 49). Later scholars throughout Chinese\nhistory who saw themselves as victims of injustice would often draw\ninspiration from Ji Kang’s courage and integrity. \nJi Kang’s extant writings include a collection of sixty poems,\nan influential “Rhapsody on the Zither” (Qin fu),\nand fourteen other essays. The concept of ziran underpins Ji\nKang’s version of Neo-Daoism. In agreement with He Yan and Wang\nBi, Ji sees an inherent order in the universe. The origin of the\nDaoist world is to be understood in terms of the transformation of\nqi. The “original qi,” brimming with\ncreative energy but completely undifferentiated, gave rise to yin and\nyang, from which heaven and earth, the five dynamic elemental forces\n(wuxing), and the myriad beings in turn ensued. Boundless but\nnot reducible to any shape or form, the Dao can be described as\nwu, but in this interpretation, the nothingness of Dao gains\nmeaning from the original oneness of qi. In this respect, Ji\nKang seems closer to He Yan than Wang Bi in drawing from the yin-yang\ncosmological theory, though there is perhaps a stronger religious\nsensibility that distinguishes Ji’s approach to the profound\nmystery of Dao. \nOn the premise that the order of nature issues from the transformation\nof qi, Ji Kang recognizes that individuals are allotted a\nqi endowment of varying abundance and purity, which defines\ntheir nature and capacity. This explains why some people are blessed\nwith long life or exceptional talents, while others must endure\ncertain natural disadvantages. The fact that one may be gifted in some\nways but deficient in others testifies to the presence of different\nconfigurations of vital powers informing each person. In an essay\ntitled “Critical Discussion on Intelligence and Courage”\n(Mingdan lun), Ji Kang thus disputed the assertion that those\nwho possess intelligence or brilliant understanding are sure to have\ncourage. Arising from different determination of qi, Ji says,\nthe two “cannot produce each other.” \nWhile most people are born with a mix of strengths and weaknesses, the\nlogic of ziran allows the possibility of perfect endowment.\nIt follows that sages must be regarded as extraordinary beings\nanimated by the finest qi essence. For the same reason, Ji\nKang defended the existence of “immortals,” a popular\nideal in religious Daoism, on the understanding that they are\nsimilarly informed by the purest form of qi, which precludes\nany defilement that causes the body and spirit to decay. \nSo defined, neither sagehood nor immortality can be attained through\nlearning or effort. However, the doctrine of ziran does not\nnecessarily entail a strong determinism or “fatalism” that\ndismisses all human effort. Immortality may be beyond reach, but as Ji\nKang explains in his essay “On Nourishing Life”\n(Yangsheng lun), self-cultivation can enhance one’s\nphysical and spiritual well-being substantially. Specifically,\nbreathing exercises, special diets and the use of drugs can help\nmaximize the limits of one’s natural endowment, and bring about\nrejuvenation and long life. Drug use, incidentally, was widespread\namong the literati in early medieval China. He Yan, for example, is\nknown to have championed a certain drug for its ability to “lift\none’s spirit,” and Ji Kang is also reputed to have been a\nconnoisseur in this field. In any case, knowledge of Dao and practice\nin the art of nourishing life can make a significant difference, even\nthough they may fall short in transforming the person into an\n“immortal.” \nIt is important to note, however, that effort directed at nourishing\nlife should always accord with ziran and must not be confused\nwith action that violates the principles of nature. This brings into\nview Ji Kang’s critique of Confucian norms and rituals, which he\nconsidered artificial and restrictive. Ji devoted an essay to refuting\nthe widely held view that people “naturally take to\nlearning.” Learning in the Confucian sense presupposes\ndiscipline and does not come naturally to people, whose need to\npreserve energy predisposes them toward repose. \nFrom this essay, it also becomes clear that the concept of\nziran is closely tied to a Daoist philosophy of history,\nwhich envisions a process of decline from a pristine beginning of\nsimplicity and wholesome goodness. Echoing the Laozi (Chapter\n18), Ji Kang asserts that it is only when the “great Dao”\nfell into disuse—that is, when selfishness and strife rendered\nnatural, prereflective kindness out of the ordinary—that\nbenevolence and righteousness came to be treasured as acquired,\nremedial virtues. In this sense, Confucian learning reflects but the\nloss of naturalness in a world dominated by self-interest. \nIn another essay, “On Dispelling Self-interest” (Shisi\nlun), Ji Kang brings out further the ethical implications of\nziran. Without self-interest means, at the very least, that\none is completely open about one’s feelings and intentions. This\ndoes not guarantee moral purity, of course, but it reflects a mind no\nlonger burdened by praise or blame, approval or censure, and other\nself-regarding concerns. Conversely, veiled motives and hidden\nfeelings invariably involve calculations of cost and benefit that\ncorrupt the mind, even if they are invested in moral ventures.\nIdeally, in the case of a sage endowed with a perfect nature, complete\nopenness and purity coincide. For the majority, however, self-interest\nposes an obstacle to realizing ziran. From this perspective,\nnourishing life thus takes on a deeper ethical meaning. Although\nbreathing exercises and the use of qi-enhancing drugs may be\nuseful, ultimately all such effort must be directed at dispelling\nself-interest. To dispel self-interest and in this sense attain utmost\n“emptiness,” it is necessary to confront the root problem\nof desire. \nDesires are harmful to both body and mind, as Ji Kang emphasizes in\n“On Nourishing Life.” Purity of being, in contrast,\nentails the absence of desire or any form of emotional disturbance.\nAre all desires, then, unnatural? The essay drew a sharp response from\nXiang Xiu, for whom desire arises naturally from the mind. As such, it\ncannot be eradicated but only regulated by rules of propriety and\nritual action. In reply, Ji Kang points out that although pleasure and\nanger, and the desire for fame and beauty may stem from the self, like\na tumor they only serve to deplete one’s qi. Basic\nneeds are of course not to be denied, but desires are shaped by\nobjects and reflect cognitive distortions that consume the self. To\nquench one’s thirst, one does not desire to drink the whole\nriver. This is fundamentally different from the desire for power and\nwealth, which knows no rest. Moreover, the suppression of desire by\nartificial means may remove certain symptoms, but it does not cure the\ndisease. It is only by recognizing the harmful influences of desire\nthat one begins to seek calmness and emptiness of mind. Ultimately,\nnourishing life is not just about health and longevity but sets its\nsight on a higher, and to Ji Kang, more authentic, mode of being\ncharacterized by dispassion. \nIn this connection, Ji Kang’s famous thesis that emotions are\nforeign to music—or literally, that “sounds do not have\n[in them] sorrow or joy” (sheng wu ai le)—becomes\nreadily understandable. If desire and the emotions that flow from it\nare not intrinsic to nature, and since sounds are naturally produced\nby the vibration of qi energies, it cannot be the case that\nmusic embodies sorrow or joy, as classical Confucian musical theory\ngenerally assumes. Subjective and cognitive reactions, including the\npossibility of emotional contagion, in other words, should be\ndistinguished from what is natural and objective; otherwise, Ji\nargues, one can hardly account for the fact that the same piece of\nmusic may evoke different responses in different audiences. On the\naesthetic front, this has the effect of opening up the field of\naesthetic judgment—for example, music condemned by classical\nConfucianism as inherently “licentious” could now be\nreappraised in terms of their musical quality. At the ethical and\nspiritual level, music can be a powerful aid to nourishing life. This\nis because music can articulate harmony that would render conditions\nmore favorable for dispelling self-interest. Ji Kang’s work on\nnourishing life and the nature of music wielded considerable influence\namong Xuanxue scholars. \nJi Kang is often depicted as a radical iconoclast, who openly\nchallenged the authority of classical models of moral attainment,\nincluding Confucius. Compared with He Yan and Wang Bi, he certainly\nseems less inclined to accommodate Confucian learning and ritual\npractice in his vision of ziran. It is also true that he was\npolitically frustrated and marginalized. Yet, the emphasis on\nnourishing life need not imply abandoning the sociopolitical world for\na life of reclusive exile. Like Wang Bi, Ji recognizes that the order\nof ziran encompasses basic social institutions such as the\nfamily and the state. In his “Family Admonitions”\n(Jiajie), he instructed his children to uphold integrity in\nboth private and public life. In an essay devoted to the teachings of\ngovernment (Taishi zhen), Ji affirmed that rulership has a\nbasis in the principles of nature. Respect for elders and kindness are\nnot contrary to ziran, so long as they do not become\ndeliberate acts with a view to self-gain. \nIn another essay (Guan Cai lun), Ji Kang attempted to\nrehabilitate the two nobles of the Zhou dynasty—Lords Guan and\nCai—who had been condemned by later historians for their\nopposition to the Duke of Zhou. Commentators generally agree that the\nhistorical discussion serves but as a thin disguise for Ji’s\ncriticism of the regime in power at that time. This is not the work of\na man who rejected politics as a matter of principle, but points\ninstead to an engaged intellectual who would stop at nothing to make\nknown the truth as he saw it. In the end, if the order of\nziran were allowed to flourish, if desire and self-interest\nwere pacified, and if careful nourishing were applied to remove\ninterference especially of the Confucian and Legalist variety, society\nwould attain peace and harmony of its own accord. Despite the tragic\ncircumstances of his life, Ji Kang proves rather sanguine in his faith\nin the power of ziran. \nRuan Ji, like Ji Kang, captured the imagination of later generations\nas a model of authenticity, an intellectual who was completely true to\nhis principles. An outstanding poet and musician, he is also\nremembered for his daring defiance of the Confucian orthodoxy, at a\ntime when deviation from the norms of tradition could easily be deemed\nseditious. To his admirers, Ruan Ji was a tragic hero. Well versed in\nboth Confucian and Daoist learning, he was evidently a man of\nprinciple who took seriously the calling of an intellectual to bring\npeace and harmony to the state. Hailing from a distinguished family,\nhe was in a strong position to make a difference in public affairs.\nThe unforgiving realities of third-century Chinese politics, however,\nsoon took its toll on Ruan, who found himself trapped in a world of\nviolence and duplicity. Proud and uncompromising, never a consenting\npartner in the intercourse of power, Ruan Ji had to endure repeated\nslander and escaped censure only by finding refuge in an almost\nconstant intoxicated stupor. \nDrinking was an important aspect of literati culture. Wine made from a\nvariety of fruits and grains was widely consumed. In Ruan’s\ncase, wine became a means to self-expression as well as a lifeline to\npreserving his integrity. According to his biography, he avoided a\nmarriage proposal from the de facto ruling house by staying drunk for\nsixty days (Jin shu 49). Whether this actually happened, or\nwhether he was an alcoholic is not the issue; what emerges from this\nand other reports is a portrait of a frustrated but sensitive and\nardent thinker, whose outrage at an immoral world finds precise\nexpression in “outrageous” opinions and behavior\nchallenging the legitimacy of established practice. Even at his\nmother’s funeral, Ruan did not stop drinking, an act that\npatently disregarded the requirement of ritual and resulted in a call\nfor his banishment from the realm. The full significance of the story\ncomes to light when the reader realizes that Ruan was in fact famous\nfor his filial piety. When his mother died, his grief was so intense\nthat he “coughed up blood” and “wasted away”\nfor a long time. \nAlthough Ruan Ji was unable to escape from the world of power, he took\nevery opportunity to assert his free and indomitable spirit. Rituals\nand convention were not meant for him, as he announced boldly, in\nresponse to a charge that he had contravened the rules of propriety in\nseeing his sister-in-law off on a journey. So disgusted with and\ndisdainful of the shallow men of high society, Ruan would literally\n“eye” his visitors in different ways—gleaming with\nadoration and pleasure when they were to his taste, or rolling his\neyes superciliously when the company was deemed foul. This did not\nearn him too many friends at court, but it certainly enhanced his\nreputation as a leader of the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove. \nRuan Ji left behind a large number of poems and several essays. An\nearly work is entitled “Disquisition on Music” (Yue\nlun), in which he discusses along Confucian lines the function of\nmusic in bringing about harmony. Like most Neo-Daoist intellectuals,\nRuan believed that the teaching of Confucius had been distorted by\nlater scholars who under the banner of Confucianism sought merely to\nfurther their own gain. Confucius was only concerned with the Dao. The\nwritings of Confucius and other sages sought to bring to light but one\nDaoist truth. Ruan Ji devoted an essay each to the Yijing,\nthe Laozi, and the Zhuangzi. While the essay on the\nYijing dates probably to his youth, and that on the\nLaozi survives only in fragments, the Da Zhuang lun\n(Critical Discussion on the Full Meaning of the Zhuangzi)\nreflects Ruan’s mature thinking. Equally important is his famous\npoetic essay, the “Biography of Master Great Man”\n(Daren xiansheng zhuan), in which he takes aim at the corrupt\nways of the world and invokes an image of Daoist transcendence, a\nbiting contrast that is rendered all the more powerful in the light of\nhis own predicament. \nLike Ji Kang, Ruan Ji focuses on the concept of ziran,\nnaturalness, in his reformulation of Daoist philosophy. Commenting on\nthe Laozi, Ruan makes clear that the concept of Dao should be\nunderstood as the “self-so” source of the processes of\nchange and transformation. Whereas the Laozi calls it Dao,\nthe Yijing describes it as the “Great Ultimate”\n(taiji), and the Spring and Autumn Annals, the\n“Origin” (yuan). Or, as Ruan writes in his essay\non the Zhuangzi, “heaven and earth are born of\nziran, and the myriad beings are born of heaven and\nearth.” There is “nothing outside” (wuwai)\nthe world of ziran, Ruan adds, which is to say that the Dao\nshould not be mistaken for any metaphysical agent or entity. Rather,\nthe theory of naturalness suggests that heaven and earth and\neverything within it originate from one qi. All phenomena are\nconstituted by qi; as such, according to Ruan, Zhuangzi is\nsurely right in maintaining that “the myriad beings are but one\nbody” (Zhuangzi, Chapter 5). \nThe plenitude of nature reflects the inexhaustible resourcefulness of\nthe Dao. Moreover, phenomena conform to constant principles and\nfunction in harmony. In his Zhuangzi essay, Ruan details in\ntraditional cosmological terms how the original qi\ndifferentiates into yin and yang, the two basic forms of vital forces\nor energies that not only shape but continue to govern the phenomenal\nworld. Male and female, the hot and the cold, light and darkness, and\nother yin-yang correlates underpin the structural order of the Daoist\nuniverse. The movement of the sun and the moon, the regularity of the\nseasons, the operation of wind and rain, and other natural processes\ndisclose further a dynamic regime of self-regulating change and\nrenewal. In this way, an inherent order is shown to lie at the heart\nof ziran. As in Ji Kang’s analysis, this forms the\nbasis of an ethics of naturalness. \nThe ideal sage, of course, embodies naturalness in his entire being.\nThis presupposes a profound understanding of what the\nZhuangzi calls the “equality of things,” now\nexplained by Ruan Ji in terms of the oneness of qi. Life and\ndeath, fortune and misfortune, and other seemingly unbridgeable\ndivides form but moments in the same continuum of natural\ntransformation. The sage, accordingly, regards them as one.\nDistinctions, in the sense of value discrimination, can thus no longer\nbe maintained. Whether this entails a mystical union with nature\nremains a question. Ruan’s poetic eloquence, especially in the\n“Biography of Master Great Man,” often appears to rise to\nmystical heights. Nevertheless, the more important point seems to be\nthat the sage recognizes the centrality of emptiness and quiescence in\na life of ziran. \nDevoid of self-interest, unmoved by riches and power, completely at\nease with his own nature and the natural order of things at large, the\nsage attains freedom and in this sense, “transcendence.”\nIn contrast, as “Master Great Man” denounces, the learned\n“gentlemen” of polite society are no better than the lice\nthat dwell in one’s pants. Hiding deep in the recesses of\ntradition, they dare not move against ritual and dread any threat to\nthe status quo. When hungry, they feast parasitically on the people.\nThere is ample evidence that Ruan Ji regarded the teachings of the\nConfucian tradition at that time to be deficient and detrimental to\nthe project of naturalness. \nMore precisely, Ruan’s theory of ziran envisages an\ninner spirituality that must be protected from the corrupting\ninfluence of power and desire. There is a wholesome sincerity and\ninnocence to natural affective expressions. When desire for gain is\nallowed to dominate, however, what is spontaneous mutates into hidden\ndesigns and false appearances. For this reason, complete openness\nranks high on Ruan’s ethical agenda. In a world dominated by\nsmall-minded “gentlemen,” where sincerity of feeling is\njudged a threat to the establishment, an ethics of naturalness\ninevitably finds itself engaged in a struggle for freedom. \nLater Xuanxue scholars took great pleasure in recounting how\ndespite venomous opposition, Ruan Ji had persisted in his unorthodox\nways. For example, we are told that he frequented a neighbor’s\nplace for wine and the company of the latter’s wife. When he got\ndrunk, he would fall asleep next to her. Understandably suspicious at\nfirst, the husband nonetheless found Ruan completely innocent,\nhonorable and above reproach in both intention and act. In this, we\nsee how moral character is traced to naturalness. Another neighbor had\na talented and beautiful daughter who unfortunately died young.\nAlthough Ruan did not know the family, he went all the same to her\nfuneral and cried with total abandon. Whether in these or other\naccounts, the point is always that whereas rituals and taboos stifle\nand corrupt the self, naturalness promises liberation and a return to\nauthenticity. \nDoes not the open display of emotions contradict the emphasis on\n“emptiness”? He Yan, for example, had argued that sages do\nnot experience pleasure and anger, or sorrow and joy. However, as this\nview entails that sages must be regarded as ontologically distinct\nfrom ordinary human beings and that sagehood is beyond the reach of\nself-cultivation, not all Xuanxue scholars would be amenable\nto it. As we have seen, Wang Bi had countered that\n“emptiness” need not suggest the absence of emotion, but\nrather an enlightened mode of being not bound by emotional or other\nattachments. These arguments would have been known to Ruan Ji. Given\nRuan’s emphasis on authenticity, he would be concerned to show\nthat genuine affective responses flowing from a pure heart empty of\nselfish desire belong integrally to the ideal ethical life. \nIn the Da Zhuang lun, Ruan Ji describes the sage as a\n“person of ultimate attainment” (zhiren), whose\nprofound understanding of the “equality” of things in the\norder of ziran naturally expresses itself in a simple yet\nfulfilled life. On a larger scale, this should translate into a\npeaceful and harmonious society. If nature had yielded an originally\npristine order, how did it come to be infested with an army of\n“lice”? Ruan Ji provides a startling response in his\n“Biography of Master Great Man.” \nAt the “beginning,” when yin and yang naturally took their\ncourse, when domination and deceit were yet unknown, all under heaven\nindeed lived in perfect harmony. There were neither rulers nor\nministers, and yet order prevailed of its own accord. When rulership\nwas established, Ruan goes on to say, domination arose; when ministers\nwere appointed, conflict and deceit also came into the world. It is\nnot entirely clear why or how kingship came to be established, but\njudging from Ruan’s essay on the Zhuangzi, much of the\nblame lies with subjective discrimination. When natural distinctions\n(e.g., differences in size) became value markers (e.g., that big is\n“better” than small), desire and domination already began\nto cloud the true picture. \nIn elevating naturalness above all manmade institutions, Ruan Ji thus\nfound a place for anarchism, which is rarely entertained in the whole\nof Chinese philosophy. During the fourth century, perhaps reflecting\nthe political turbulence of the period, another thinker by the name of\nBao Jingyan did take up the same theme in an essay entitled\n“Disquisition on Not Having Rulers” (Wu jun lun).\nAlthough the work has not survived, it was criticized by Ge Hong (ca.\n283–363) in his Baopuzi (The Master Who Embraces\nSimplicity). According to Ge Hong, Bao was an avid reader of the\nLaozi and the Zhuangzi and was adept in the art of\ndisputation. The main thesis of his work is that rulership is but a\nform of domination that violates naturalness. Nevertheless, anarchism\ndid not find strong support in Neo-Daoism. In fact, the majority of\nXuanxue scholars may be said to have espoused fairly\n“conservative” political ideals. He Yan and Wang Bi, for\nexample, had little difficulty justifying absolute monarchical rule,\nprovided that it coincides with ziran and\n“nonaction.” \nWhile the critique of government is clear, Ruan Ji was certainly not\nplotting to overthrow it. Such scheming would be inimical to the goal\nof naturalness. Does it entail renunciation, a complete severing from\nthe political world? Ruan Ji is commonly depicted as a frustrated\nintellectual yearning for a life free of deception and untainted by\npower relations. Indeed, one suggestion is that whereas Ruan in his\nearly writings had accorded a positive place to ritual and music as\nthe work of the ancient sages to maintain harmony in the world, in his\nlater years he became totally disillusioned and turned to\nescapism. \nThis view is unhelpful, because it undermines the possibility of\nrenewal in the philosophy of ziran. The ethics of naturalness\nis not about renunciation. The sages of old were all concerned with\ndiminishing the power of desire, so as to enable the people to live\nwell and prosper. From this perspective, the Daoist recluse furnishes\na powerful symbol because he abides by ziran and not because\nhe refuses to have anything to do with the world. Similarly, the\n“Great Man” does not aspire to a life of freedom to\nrealize his own ambition, but rather to initiate a process of healing\nthat would revitalize the rule of the Dao, envisioned as a kind of\nwholesome cooperative community. If naturalness has any restorative\npower at all, disengagement should have little role to play in\nNeo-Daoist ethics. \nA generation or so after He Yan, Wang Bi and the Seven Worthies of the\nBamboo Grove, Guo Xiang (d. 312) arrived on the Xuanxue\nscene. Accomplished in philosophical debate and other forms of\ncultured discourse, he was highly regarded by his contemporaries as a\nnew Xuanxue champion “second only to Wang Bi,”\nwhose philosophical prowess had by then acquired legendary\nproportions. Guo Xiang is by far the most important interpreter of the\nZhuangzi in Chinese history. Through his effort, indeed, the\nZhuangzi has come down to us in its present form, divided\ninto thirty-three chapters. Yet, Guo Xiang has also been accused of no\nless an intellectual offense than plagiarism. \nAs early as the fifth century, the charge was made that Guo had\nplagiarized the work of Xiang Xiu, a close friend of Ji Kang and\nfellow member of the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove. Xiang Xiu is\nprimarily noted for his work on the Zhuangzi, though he is\nalso known to have written a commentary to the Yijing.\nAccording to the Shishuo xinyu (4.17), “Initially,\nthere were scores of Zhuangzi commentators, but none could\ngrasp its meaning and essential teachings. Xiang Xiu then went beyond\nthe old commentaries to interpret the Zhuangzi [afresh]. His\nexplanation was subtle and penetrating, which greatly advanced the\ncause of the [Learning in the] Profound.” Xiang Xiu’s\ncommentary was incomplete, as the text goes on to relate, and Guo\nXiang later “stole” it as his own. \nThis is a harsh judgment on Guo Xiang. The biography of Xiang Xiu in\nthe Jin shu (Chapter 49) recounts only that Guo Xiang had\n“extended” the former’s work. Although Guo was\nundoubtedly influenced by Xiang Xiu, whose work survives only in the\nform of quotations preserved in later sources, recent scholarship\ngenerally agrees that Guo had drawn his own conclusions. Seeking to\nreconcile the yearning for freedom and transcendence with\nsociopolitical engagement, Guo Xiang fuses together in his\nZhuangzi commentary ontological and ethical insights. It is\nworth noting that despite the extremely unstable political conditions\nthat plagued the early Jin dynasty, and the fact that Guo had come\nfrom a relatively humble background, he enjoyed a long and\ndistinguished public career. Besides the Zhuangzi, Guo also\nwrote on the Laozi and the Lunyu, although these are\nno longer extant except for a few fragments cited in other\nsources. \nLike Wang Bi, Guo Xiang recognizes the ontological import of Daoist\nphilosophy. There is no disagreement that all beings originate from\nDao. However, Guo takes issue with the view that the key to unlocking\nthe mystery of Dao lies in the concept of wu, nothingness.\nThis is because nothingness remains an abstraction, a negation\nsignifying what being is not in Wang Bi’s interpretation, and as\nsuch cannot bring about creation. So defined, wu and the\ncategory of beings (you) are mutually exclusive; as Guo\nplainly states, “It is not only that wu cannot change\ninto being but also that being cannot change into wu”\n[in the abstract sense of nonbeing] (commentary to Zhuangzi\n22). \nThe appeal to a divine creator should indeed be rejected, but this\ndoes not entail a nihilistic absence. Having disposed of these\noptions, what does Guo Xiang have to offer in their place? He writes,\n“Because wu [by definition] is not being, it cannot\nproduce being. Prior to the coming to be of being, it cannot produce\nother beings. In that case, then, who or what brought about the birth\nof being? [The answer can only be that] beings are spontaneously\nself-generated” (commentary to Zhuangzi 2). \nXuanxue studies are fond of contrasting Wang Bi’s\nemphasis on wu with Guo Xiang’s focus on being.\nHowever, what is more critical is how Guo Xiang arrives at his\nconclusion. Certainly, the mystery of creation cannot be resolved by\npositing an objectified, transcendent Dao. But, this does not warrant\na flight to nothingness, which as a conceptual device cannot be an\nagent of real production and change. To Guo Xiang, then, the only\nlogical alternative would be to recognize the reality of spontaneous\n“self-production” (zi sheng) and\n“self-transformation” (zi hua or du\nhua). These ideas are already present in Xiang Xiu’s\ncommentary to the Zhuangzi, but in the hands of Guo Xiang,\nthere is now fuller disclosure of the perceived deeper philosophical\nmeaning of ziran. \nAt the most basic ontological level, prior to the birth of the myriad\nbeings, being is “so of itself,” which implies that being\nexists eternally. In Guo’s own words, “Generally, we may\nknow the causes of certain things and affairs near to us. But tracing\ntheir origin to the ultimate end, we find that without any cause, they\nof themselves come to be what they are. Being so of themselves, we can\nno longer question the reason or cause of their being, but should\naccept them as they are” (commentary to Zhuangzi 14).\nIn this sense, “self-production” or\n“self-transformation” does not quite explain\n“how” being came into existence; instead, it offers a\nlogical alternative, which bypasses the philosophical problems\nassociated with both a pure negation and the positing of a particular\ncausal agent. At the epistemological level, the further implication is\nthat self-transformation remains a mystery. Far from being a source of\nperplexities, to Guo Xiang, this frees and reorients the mind to\nrealize the nature of Dao and a life of ziran. \nThe doctrine of self-transformation, for which Guo is particularly\nremembered, affirms that the Dao is everywhere and in all things. The\nlogic of immanence takes full effect, once nothingness is removed from\nview. Even in the most base and lowly, as the Zhuangzi\nemphasizes, the presence of Dao can be detected (Chapter 22). To Guo\nXiang, the Zhuangzi can only be alluding to the pervasiveness\nof qi. \nAll beings are endowed with a “share” or allotment\n(fen) of qi, the inexhaustible power of the Dao,\nwhich gives them life and determines their nature and capacity.\nMoreover, the order of nature depicts not a state of random disorder,\nbut an organized regime in which all parts have a role to play. With\nrespect to human beings, for example, the body functions harmoniously\nas a unified whole in accordance with specific principles\n(li). Without undermining the interdependence of the\nmultitude of organs, there is a hierarchical structure to the workings\nof the body, where the mind assumes sovereign control. In these\nrespects, guided by the concepts of qi and principle, Guo\nXiang follows the mainstream Neo-Daoist analysis of\nziran. \nGiven that individuals enjoy a particular “share” of the\nDao, differences in natural endowment should be recognized. For\nexample, due to the different allotment of qi, some people\nare born with a high degree of intelligence or gifted in other ways.\nBecause everything is what it is “so of itself,” Guo Xiang\nmust admit that “what one is born with is not something that is\nundue or inappropriate” (commentary to Zhuangzi 5).\nBecause one’s nature is determined by exact principles, one may\nalso speak of destiny in this connection. Is Guo, then, committed to a\nkind of thoroughgoing fatalism? Does this entail a rigid system in\nwhich individuals merely conform to prescribed roles? \nIt is a matter of destiny or “fate” that one is born of\nsage character, average capacity, or disadvantaged. In all cases, Guo\nmaintains that one ought to accept one’s natural endowment.\nExtending a naturalistic reading to an old religious concept, this is\nin Guo’s estimation what is meant by the “mandate of\nheaven” (tianming). As it cannot be disputed that there\nare individuals who are blessed with an exceptionally rich qi\nendowment, there is thus some truth to the view held by He Yan and\nothers that sageness is defined by an inborn sage nature. Yet, is it\nthe case that sagehood is restricted to a select few? Guo is also\nconcerned to distinguish destiny as fact from value, and to make room\nfor change and development in human flourishing. \nDifferences based on endowment do not constitute any basis for value\njudgment. This is central to Guo’s overall argument and is\nreminiscent of Ruan Ji’s view of naturalness in some respects.\nAs the Zhuangzi repeatedly argues, what needs to be\nrecognized is the “equality of things.” Equality is not to\nbe confused with sameness. In this context, equality suggests that all\nbeings are partners in the larger architecture of Dao. Being gifted\ndoes not necessarily make one “better”; even a physically\nor mentally handicapped person is “complete” in his or her\nown way. Differences among individuals are undeniable, but they do not\nlegitimize prejudice or discrimination. \nAt the sociopolitical level, human relationships are also governed by\nconstant principles; like different parts of the body, individuals\nhave their proper place in the social and political assembly. From\nthis perspective, as opposed to conventional arrangements that can be\nchanged or discarded at will, both the family and the state should be\nunderstood as expressions of ziran. \nFurthermore, in view of the hierarchical order of nature, Guo does not\nhesitate to say that the father should be the head of the family, and\nthat the state should be ruled by the king. This would rule out\nanarchism. In this regard, while Guo Xiang and Ruan Ji agree on the\ncentrality of naturalness, they come to very different conclusions on\nthe ideal structure of the state. What needs to be made clear is that\nthe necessary gradation of authority for different roles and\nresponsibilities that comes with a hierarchical system does not\nwarrant any form of authoritarian government that oppresses the\npeople. The father may be the authoritative figure in the family, but\nhe would not be in that position if not for his children. As\n“children” of the Dao, all beings are indispensable and\noccupy an equally important station in the order of\nziran. \nWhereas scholars such as Wang Bi emphasize unity over multiplicity,\nGuo Xiang underscores the richness and diversity of the Daoist world.\nIndividuality is not sacrificed for political interests, or dissolved\ninto a sea of metaphysical oneness. On the contrary, as Guo forcefully\nargues, there is no greater calamity than the loss of individuality\nand authenticity, of one’s identity as endowed by nature\n(commentary to Zhuangzi 10). Conversely, the Daoist goal can\nbe defined as the realization of one’s nature, and particularly\nthe optimization of one’s inborn capacity. As nature blossoms,\ndestiny is fulfilled. \nWhile this may not be able to detract entirely from the charge of\nfatalism, Guo Xiang does aim to introduce a dynamic view of nature and\ndestiny. It also opens up a deeper dimension to the notion of\nsagehood. The Daoist world is never static; it changes and renews\nitself constantly. The mountain or ocean may appear unchanging, but it\nis perpetually in flux. This is mirrored in human existence, where\nindividuals grow with the passage of time (commentary to\nZhuangzi 6). Although constituted by qi and\nregulated by principles, individuals and societies need not be viewed\nas fixed assets without possibility of change and development. Indeed,\nwhile the order of nature must be respected, the person of Dao\nrecognizes the inevitability of change. The sage nourishes his nature\nand adapts constantly to changes in the social and natural\nenvironment. This, as Guo Xiang sees it, brings out the real meaning\nof Daoist nonaction (wuwei). \nNonaction “does not mean folding one’s arms and keeping\nquiet,” as Guo makes explicit what most Xuanxue\nscholars implicitly acknowledge (commentary to Zhuangzi 11).\nIt is also not a technical skill, requiring special training or\ndiscipline. In Guo Xiang’s interpretation, nonaction stems from\na profound discernment of the way of naturalness, which entails not so\nmuch doing less of certain things, as a mode of being and spirit of\naction guided by the principles of nature, according to which one\nperforms all functions. \nThere are two aspects to Guo’s understanding of wuwei.\nFirst, as things and affairs are informed by principles, there is a\nnatural way of action and interaction. Like the fabulous Cook Ding\n(Zhuangzi 3) who could cut up an ox without having to rely on\nsensory perception or mental calculation, and just as spontaneous\naffection characterizes the parent-child relation, the sage\naccomplishes all tasks by simply following the “grain” or\nnature of phenomena. \nSecond, in the light of the equality of things, nonaction ideally\nleads to a sense of freedom and equanimity. Instead of chasing after\nfalse ideals, trying to be like someone else, and ending up a prisoner\nof restless striving and deceit, one should stay true to oneself and\ndevelop one’s nature. If self-sufficiency is assumed, there is\nno point in imitating others, including those blessed with a special\nqi endowment; to do so, indeed, as Guo Xiang puts it, would\nbe like a fish’s aspiring to become a bird (commentary to\nZhuangzi 2). \nThis is important and marks Guo’s originality. Nonaction cannot\nbe divorced from naturalness or reserved for those with an inborn sage\nnature alone. What is required of self-fulfillment has already been\ngiven; to clamor after what is foreign to one’s genuine\n“share” of the Dao is not only futile but also\nself-negating. If this is true, the very idea of sageness needs to be\nreconsidered.  \nAgain, it should be recognized that there are those who embody a\nspecial sage nature—they are like “pines and\ncypresses,” which are the finest of trees (commentary to\nZhuangzi 5)—but more fundamentally, as Guo Xiang\nexplains, the term “sage” designates those who have\nrealized their nature (commentary to Zhuangzi 1). This\neffectively removes any barrier to attaining sagehood. Thus, while Guo\nagrees with He Yan in recognizing the decisive difference of\nqi endowment, he is also able to address Wang Bi’s\nobjection, discussed earlier, and offer an alternative avenue to\nrealizing great peace. \nAgainst helplessness and passive resignation, Guo Xiang calls for a\nconstructive celebration of individuality and the plenitude of the\nDaoist world. Free from the hold of desire and the ceaseless\nundulation of discontent, one reaps an inner calm and grows at ease\nwith the external world. Even death loses its fearsome grip, for one\nrealizes that life and death are equally a part of the transformation\nof nature. The person of Dao does not need to live in reclusion or\nshun politics. In fact, any deliberate disavowal of communal life\nwould violate the spirit of naturalness. The important point is that\n“although the sage [in the broad sense of someone who has\nrealized his true nature] finds himself in the halls of ritual and\ngovernment, his mind is not different from when he is surrounded by\nmountains and trees” (commentary to Zhuangzi 1). Beyond\nthe sway of the emotions, the sage roams the world without being moved\nor enslaved by it. This, to Guo Xiang, truly captures the essence of\n“carefree wandering,” which is now shown to have a place\nin mundane activities. \nPolitically, the ruler should also abide by naturalness and nonaction.\nThis means, besides self-cultivation, allowing and encouraging the\npeople to develop their nature and capacity to the fullest. Thus,\nartificial restrictions and interference should be minimized. Official\nappointments, moreover, must be made on the basis of capacity and not\nby family background, as was commonly the case in Guo’s China.\nIn return, as Guo confidently predicts, ministers and subjects would\nnaturally fulfill their duties, and all under heaven would live in\npeace and contentment. As needs and circumstances change, social and\npolitical practice should not be fossilized. Timely adjustments would\nhelp ensure renewal and harmony in a dynamic realm. \nFrom He Yan and Wang Bi to the Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove and\nGuo Xiang, the main contours of Neo-Daoism can be discerned. Sharing\nthe same philosophical vocabulary and reacting to a common heritage,\nthe proponents of the new Learning in the Profound may appear to be\nspeaking with a single voice. On closer examination, it becomes\napparent that they seek in their own way to make sense of the mystery\nof Dao. Friendship and patronage do play an important role in early\nmedieval Chinese literati culture, but they do not diminish the\npremium placed on intellectual independence, rigor, and originality.\nThis is best reflected in the many debates that populate the world of\nNeo-Daoist learning. \nThe view of He Yan that the sage is by nature absolutely impartial,\nabove the fray of the emotions, attracted a great deal of attention at\nthat time. The Sanguo zhi (Chapter 28, commentary), for\nexample, reports that Zhong Hui (225–264), who rivaled Wang Bi\nas one of the brightest intellectual stars of the age, and others all\nelaborated on it. Wang Bi, as we have seen, put forward a dissenting\nview, which on the basis of a particular logic of nothingness grounds\nthe possibility of sagehood in an original nature untainted by\ncognitive distortions and affective disturbances. Later, Guo Xiang\nsought a new resolution by aligning sagehood with self-realization.\nThe role of the emotions and the natural differences based on\nqi endowment may be admitted, but in the being of the sage\nthe burden of value attachment that they bring has been totally\n“forgotten” or lifted in the light of the equality of\nthings (e.g., see Guo Xiang, commentary to Zhuangzi 2).\nBearing directly on the question of sagehood is the larger debate on\nthe relationship between a person’s capacity and nature. \nAlthough it is generally agreed that nature is inborn and formed by\nqi energies, whether it is solely responsible for a\nperson’s capacity, be it intellectual, physical, psychological\nor moral, remains an issue. This is important not only because it\nconcerns the nature of sagehood, whether it is an attainable goal or\ndetermined by an essential sage nature, but also because the right\ntalent must be identified for public office. A late second-century or\nearly third-century work by Liu Shao, the Renwu zhi\n(translated into English as The Study of Human Abilities) has\nalready broached the question and attempted to map out the various\ntypes of talent and the signs by which they might be identified. This\ndeveloped into a major debate, on which Zhong Hui composed a treatise\ncalled “On the Four Roots of Capacity and Nature”\n(Caixing siben lun). \nZhong’s work has not survived, but it is widely reported that\nthe debate involved four distinct positions—namely, that\ncapacity and nature are “identical” (tong); that\nthey are “different” (yi); that they\n“coincide” (he); and that they\n“diverge” (li) from each other. \nThe first view is represented by Fu Jia (also pronounced Fu Gu,\n209–255), who emerged as a major policy maker during the Wei-Jin\ntransition. On this account, both nature and capacity are determined\nby one’s qi endowment. Whereas nature is the inner\nsubstance, capacity reaches outward in functional ability and conduct.\nThis view finds eloquent support in another third-century work, the\n“Disquisition on Capacity and Nature” (Caixing\nlun) by Yuan Zhun, who was on good terms with Ruan Ji. According\nto Yuan, beings can be either excellent or of a poor quality. Whereas\nthe former are endowed with “pure qi,” the latter\nare constituted by energies of a more “turbid”\ncomposition. It is like a piece of wood, Yuan adds; whether it is\ncrooked or straight is a matter of nature, on the basis of which it\nhas a certain capacity that can be made to serve particular ends. \nThe second is represented by Li Feng (d. 254), according to whom Fu\nJia had misconstrued the relationship between capacity and nature.\nThis is because whereas nature is inborn, capacity is shaped by\nlearning. What nature provides is simply the biological apparatus or\nfaculties that enable a person to grow and to learn; the person one\nbecomes, in contrast, is the result of learning and putting into\npractice the teaching of the sages. Any accomplishment, including the\nattainment of sagehood, ultimately depends on effort. Yu Huan, a noted\nthird-century historian, provides a helpful analogy to explain the\npoint—the effect of learning on a person, he says, is like\nadding color to a piece of plain silk (Sanguo zhi 13,\ncommentary). \nZhong Hui himself held the third view, which attempts to mediate\nbetween the first two positions. Although native endowment is\nnecessary for realized capacity, it is not sufficient. What is\nendowed, in other words, marks a person’s potential, which must\nbe carefully nurtured and brought to fruition. For sages and\nimmortals, who are different in kind because of their exceptional\nqi constitution, innate capacity naturally manifests itself\ncompletely in extraordinary achievements. For ordinary human beings,\nhowever, nature does not amount to actual ability but only furnishes\ncertain aptitude, dispositions or directions of development. Of\ncourse, if the native endowment is extremely poor, there is not much\nthat can be done. Nevertheless, the real challenge to Fu Jia’s\nidentity thesis is that an excellent endowment may go to waste because\nthe person succumbs to desire and would not learn. \nFinally, Wang Guang (d. 251) argued for the last position, which is\nstronger than Li Feng’s and appears to be directed especially\nagainst Zhong Hui’s modified identity thesis. Inborn nature does\nnot provide the necessary fertile ground for cultivation; rather, it\nneeds to be rectified by learning. Human beings are inherently driven\nby desire and therefore must rely on rituals and instruction to become\nresponsible individuals. In this sense, capacity and nature do not\ncoincide but diverge from each other. \nIt has been suggested that the debate should be understood in the\ncontext of the power struggle between the main rival factions in Wei\npolitics. Specifically, Fu Jia and Zhong Hui both sided with the\nfaction that was to emerge victorious and strike down Li Feng and Wang\nGuang. Political affiliation, like patronage, is certainly important,\nbut it does not dictate philosophical opinion in Neo-Daoism. He Yan,\nfor example, would favor Fu Jia’s identity thesis, given his\nunderstanding of human nature, despite the fact that the latter had\ncriticized him openly. Similarly, Ji Kang would find Zhong Hui’s\nattempt to accommodate learning and effort agreeable, even though he\nhad rejected Zhong’s overtures to befriend him and in the end\nwas put to death at Zhong’s instigation. \nAnother key debate in Neo-Daoist philosophy concerns the relationship\nbetween “words” (yan) and “meaning”\n(yi). The debate has its roots in the Yijing, where\nConfucius is made to ask whether words can fully disclose meaning.\nThis goes beyond the interpretation of any one work, but probes the\nnature of understanding itself. As common experience seems to suggest,\nwords often fail to express intense emotions or complex ideas. A\nminority view, represented by the late third-century thinker Ouyang\nJian, defended the thesis that meaning is completely\n“exhausted” or expressed by words (yan jin yi).\nThe majority of Xuanxue scholars, however, regarded words as\nnecessary but insufficient to understanding. \nA spokesman for the position that “words cannot fully express\nmeaning” (yan bu jin yi) was Xun Can (ca.\n212–240), who gained considerable notoriety for his claim that\nthe classics were but the “chaff” of the sages’\nprofound learning. The conclusion is inescapable, according to Xun,\nfor meaning transcends the limiting confines of language. Wang Bi\nsupplies a fuller and more nuanced argument. Although meaning is\nmediated by words and images, the means of interpretation must not be\nconfused with the end itself. Words can in fact become an obstacle to\nunderstanding if they are made the focus of interpretation. Citing the\nZhuangzi, Wang maintains that the words and images that make\nup a text must be “forgotten” before its meaning can be\ncomprehended. To understand a poem, for example, it is not enough to\nassemble an exhaustive list of definitions. The words are\n“forgotten” or left behind in the sense that understanding\nreaches into the underlying world of ideas where a deeper meaning\nresides. Guo Xiang also makes clear that although ideas issue from\nwords, they cannot be reduced to their literal, surface meaning. This\nis especially important to understanding the Zhuangzi, which\nemploys a large number of parables and metaphors, often involving\nspiritual figures or supernatural exploits. Taken literally, they\nverge on the fantastic; understood properly, they intimate the wonder\nof the Dao and the order of ziran. \nThis diverges sharply from the Han hermeneutical model, which\ntypically on the basis of a kind of correspondence theory assumes that\nwords have fixed meanings located in external referents. Specifically,\nunder the dominance of yin-yang theories, the classics were seen to\nrefer to particular cosmological phenomena. For example, Han\ncommentators commonly took the word “one” to mean the pole\nstar. In contrast, Neo-Daoist writings show little interest in\ncosmological speculation. This does not mean that the authors had\nabandoned the yin-yang cosmology; rather, they took the classics to be\nconcerned with issues more profound than naming the various components\nof the cosmos. A poem may depict actual objects or events; but sense\nis not limited to reference, and the meaning of the whole transcends\nthe identity of its parts. From a new hermeneutical perspective,\nproponents of Xuanxue thus endeavor to reverse an\n“outward” interpretive course to return to the\n“roots”; that is to say, to recapture the perceived core\nteachings of the sages. This may suggest direct illumination or\nintuition, a sudden apprehension of meaning. However, it should be\nremembered that all the major Neo-Daoists discussed here excelled in\nthe art of argumentation, which is to say that there is no substitute\nfor careful philosophical analysis. Once the chain of references is\nbroken, once the hermeneutical perspective is altered, interpretation\nis free to pursue the deeper meaning of the “dark” and\nprofound, which in the final analysis is what Xuanxue is all\nabout. \n\n \n  \nFrom a broader perspective, given the dissatisfaction with Han\nConfucianism, many of the debates in Xuanxue revolve around\nthe relationship between “orthodox teachings”\n(mingjiao)—the normative “naming”\n(ming) that determines standards and values—and\nziran. Both offer an idealized picture of the world, an\nimagined state in which order and harmony prevailed and to which the\ntroubled world of the present must seek to return. Does the former,\nbound by doctrines of propriety, rituals, and government, oppose\nnaturalness and thwart all aspiration toward a life of “carefree\nwandering”? The debate on “nourishing life,” for\nexample, reflects this concern. Two main approaches may be\ndistinguished, whose impact far exceeds the quiet preserves of the\nphilosophers’ “bamboo grove,” to spark new trends in\nboth politics and culture. \nFor Wang Bi, it is clear that government and society should ideally\nconform to the principles of ziran, as they stem from the\nsame “root.” Guo Xiang is even more specific in arguing\nthat the norms and rites that define civilization are not alien to\nziran but in principle flow spontaneously from it. The\nnatural bond between mother and child, for example, attests to the\ninherent harmony between ideal mingjiao and ziran.\nAlthough decay and corruption may have set in, the ethics of\nnaturalness does not seek to escape from the roles and\nresponsibilities of sociopolitical life. \nTo Wang Bi, it is imperative that the ruler and those in power\n“return” to “emptiness and quiescence,” in\nwhich state the right policies would naturally prevail, resulting in\npeace and abundance, and more importantly, simplicity, genuineness and\ncontentment. To Guo Xiang, the hierarchical structure of society need\nnot be oppressive, for each and every person is “equal”\nand self-sufficient, which enables an inner transcendence that is the\nmark of authenticity and the full realization of one’s nature\nand capacity. \nDifferences in interpretation notwithstanding, Wang Bi and Guo Xiang\nconverge in recognizing the place of certain basic normative patterns\nand principles in the order of nature, and the need to ensure that\nthey do not deviate from it. This is the first main approach to the\ndebate between mingjiao and ziran. It is perhaps not\nincorrect to speak of their having brought together Confucian and\nDaoist concerns, inasmuch as Confucianism pays special attention to\npropriety and government, whereas Daoism focuses on naturalness. The\nsame may be said for Xiang Xiu, who wrote an essay entitled “On\nConfucianism and Daoism” (Ru Dao lun) in his youth.\nAlthough he apparently discarded it and we have no knowledge of its\ncontent, the famous poet Xie Lingyun (385–433) later spoke of\nXiang Xiu as having treated “Confucianism and Daoism as\none.” Nevertheless, Xuanxue is not a kind of\nscholasticism that pitches one school against another. Instead of\nseeing them as attempting to reconcile Confucianism with Daoism, it\nmay be suggested that they were primarily concerned with the\nsubstantive issue of the relationship between mingjiao and\nziran. \nJi Kang and Ruan Ji took the stronger view that the then prevalent\northodox teachings impinged on naturalness. The burden of worldly\nstriving, ultimately driven by desire, has become so great that it\nwould not be possible to maintain an inner purity and transcendence\nwhile following the norms and rites of society and tradition. Genuine\nfreedom is possible only if one goes beyond the strictures of\nnormative orthodox teachings and aligns oneself completely with\nziran, as Ji Kang boldly asserts in “On Dispelling\nSelf-interest.” Going beyond mingjiao does not mean\nleaving the world behind in this context; again, the point is not\nrenunciation, but radical change, by reorienting one’s sense of\npropriety and value. This not only invites philosophical debate but\nalso gives impetus to an avant-garde counter-culture development,\nwhich adds a tinge of romanticism to the Xuanxue\nmovement. \nAs the idea of naturalness gained currency, many prominent men of\nletters came to appreciate strong emotions as a sign of authenticity.\nThus, Wang Rong, the youngest member of the Seven Worthies of the\nBamboo Grove, did not try to contain his grief in accordance with the\nrequirement of ritual when his son died. The sage may be oblivious to\nthe call of the emotions, he explains, and men of inferior nature are\nincapable of experiencing true affection; “it is precisely in\npeople like us that the deepest and most intense emotions find their\nplace” (Shishuo xinyu 17.4). Although there is some\ndispute whether these words should be attributed to Wang Rong or his\ncousin, Wang Yan, the point remains that naked emotions had come to be\ncherished as a Neo-Daoist ideal. In the same spirit, Xun Can was\ndevastated by the death of his wife. In response to Fu Jia’s\ncriticism that he was overreacting, Xun simply lamented that it would\nbe difficult to find again a woman of true beauty. His grief was so\nintense, we are told, that he died shortly after at the age of\ntwenty-eight (Sanguo zhi 10, commentary; cf. Shishuo\nxinyu 35.2). \nThe unaffected display of emotion often came into conflict with the\ncode of conduct sanctioned by orthodox teachings. Ruan Ji was\ncriticized on several occasions for his unorthodox behavior. These\naccounts, more than a record of events, serve to underscore the vast\ndivide that separates an idealized naturalness from the artificial and\noften hypocritical observance of orthodox customs in early medieval\nChina. Once unconventional behavior is seen to express naturalness and\nauthenticity, it is perhaps inevitable that more radical gestures\nwould come to create a colorful but nonetheless extremely slippery\nslope. For example, Liu Ling, another member of the Seven Worthies, is\nwell known for his fondness for wine. Never without a bottle in hand,\nwhen travelling he would ask an attendant to carry a shovel, so that\nhe could be buried on the spot should he die from a bout of\ndrunkenness (Jin shu 49). Answering his critics, who found\nhim naked, drinking with abandon in his house, Liu said, “I take\nheaven and earth to be my dwelling, and my rooms are my coat and\npants; so what are you gentlemen doing in my pants?”\n(Shishuo xinyu 23.6) \nAs Pure Conversation and Xuanxue culture captivated high\nsociety, many literati were quick to imitate such behavior. It became\nfashionable to give free rein to one’s impulses, and many had\nhoped to acquire a reputation as a high-minded intellectual of pure\ncharacter and lofty ideals by opposing established norms and rituals.\nWhether this represents a deterioration of Neo-Daoism need not concern\nus. The point to note is that serious implications follow from a\nphilosophy of ziran. Of course, there were Neo-Daoists who\nobjected to this trend. For example, Yue Guang\n(252–304)—whom Wang Rong, Wang Yan, and other leading\nscholars praised as a rare talent capable of taking Xuanxue\nto new heights—was obviously unimpressed by the extent to which\nmany of his contemporaries had gone in search of a\n“carefree” life. “In mingjiao itself there\nis a blissful abode,” he asks, “so why go to such\nextremes?” (Jin shu 43) \nIn the early fourth century, the Jin dynasty was forced to flee its\ncapital and to rebuild in south China. As the literati settled in a\nnew land, they looked back to the time of He Yan and Wang Bi as the\ngolden age of Xuanxue. Although Pure Conversation continued\nwith undiminished rigor, it did not introduce many new ideas. In the\nsouthern court, the senior statesman Wang Dao (276–339) is\nreported to have said that he would only talk about “nourishing\nlife,” “words and meaning,” and Ji Kang’s\ntheory of music (Shishuo xinyu 4.21). Throughout the Jin\nperiod and beyond, as another early source relates, whether\n“sounds do not have sorrow or joy” and the “four\nroots of capacity and nature” remained the stuff of\nphilosophical discussion (Nan Qi shu [History of the Southern\nQi Dynasty] 33). \nAs Neo-Daoism entered its last phase, another Daoist work, the\nLiezi, came to rival the “Three Great Works on the\nProfound.” Zhang Zhan (ca. 330–400) wrote an important\ncommentary on the work—indeed, some would argue that Zhang had a\nhand in the formation of the Liezi itself—in which he\nrecapitulated many of the ideas that spanned the entire spectrum of\nNeo-Daoist philosophy. What is of particular interest is that Zhang\nexplicitly introduced Buddhist ideas into Xuanxue. \nBuddhism had entered China long before the Jin period. Given the\nsimilarity between the Daoist concept of wu and the Buddhist\nemphasis on “emptiness,” it has been suggested that\nNeo-Daoism was influenced by Buddhist philosophy from the start.\nThough possible, there is so far no strong evidence linking He Yan,\nWang Bi and other early Neo-Daoists to Buddhism. On the contrary, it\nis clear that Xuanxue had exerted considerable influence on\nthe development of Chinese Buddhism. From the fourth century onward,\nBuddhist masters frequently engaged in Pure Conversation and\nchallenged Xuanxue scholars at their own game. For example,\nthe Shishuo xinyu (4.32) reports that the monk Zhi Dun\n(314–366) challenged the “Xiang-Guo”—i.e.,\nXiang Xiu and Guo Xiang—interpretation of the Zhuangzi,\narguing that only the enlightened sage could truly experience\ntranscendental freedom. In another episode, we find Zhi Dun taking\npart in a debate on the “four roots of capacity and\nnature” (4.51). During the Northern and Southern Dynasties that\nfollowed the Jin, Xuanxue reached the pinnacle of its\ninfluence when it was admitted into the official curriculum of the\nimperial academy. At the same time, however, Neo-Daoism also began to\nlose its vitality. As the early medieval period drew to a close, it\nwas Buddhism and religious Daoism that commanded the attention of the\nliterati. \nXuanxue or Neo-Daoism occupies a key place in the history of\nChinese philosophy. Arriving on the Chinese scene at a point of\nrupture, it redefined the classical tradition and brought into\ncurrency new ideas in metaphysics, ethics, hermeneutics, and other\nareas of philosophical concern, which facilitated the reception of\nBuddhist philosophy and laid the foundation for the Neo-Confucian\nmovement later. To recapitulate, mainstream Neo-Daoism is not a\npartisan Daoist school. Properly understood, Confucius, Laozi, and\nZhuangzi converge in their understanding of Dao. Secondly,\nXuanxue cannot be divorced from the goal of “great\npeace.” The philosophy of nothingness and naturalness does not\ngive rise to pessimism or renunciation. Even Ji Kang and Ruan Ji did\nnot abandon the promise of renewal. Although many scholars had found\nin the figure of the ancient recluse a source of inspiration, and\ndespite the fact that it was common for the literati to refuse office,\nthere was an optimism that naturalness and nonaction would in the end\nbring about harmony and peace. Finally, it should be emphasized that\nNeo-Daoism is not monolithic. The concept of nothingness, for example,\nmay have been central to the Xuanxue project, but it is\nsubject to debate and interpretation. Toward the end of the third\ncentury, for example, Pei Wei (267–300) composed a treatise\nprovocatively titled “Extoling [the Philosophical Primacy of]\nBeing” (Chongyou lun), which should give an indication\nof the vibrancy of the Learning in the Profound.","contact.mail":"alanchan@cuhk.edu.hk","contact.domain":"cuhk.edu.hk"}]
