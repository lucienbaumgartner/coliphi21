Roughly, it is a general mathematical theory of\nstructures and of systems of structures. As category theory is still\nevolving, its functions are correspondingly developing, expanding and\nmultiplying. At minimum, it is a powerful language, or conceptual\nframework, allowing us to see the universal components of a family of\nstructures of a given kind, and how structures of different kinds are\ninterrelated. Category theory is both an interesting object of\nphilosophical study, and a potentially powerful formal tool for\nphilosophical investigations of concepts such as space, system, and\neven truth. It can be applied to the study of logical systems in which\ncase category theory is called “categorical doctrines” at\nthe syntactic, proof-theoretic, and semantic levels. Category theory\neven leads to a different theoretical conception of set and, as such,\nto a possible alternative to the standard set theoretical foundation\nfor mathematics. As such, it raises many issues about mathematical\nontology and epistemology. Category theory thus affords philosophers\nand logicians much to use and reflect upon.\n\n\n\n\nCategories are algebraic structures with many complementary natures,\ne.g., geometric, logical, computational, combinatorial, just as groups\nare many-faceted algebraic structures. Eilenberg & Mac Lane\n(1945) introduced categories in a purely auxiliary fashion, as\npreparation for what they called functors and natural\ntransformations. The very definition of a category evolved over time,\naccording to the author’s chosen goals and metamathematical\nframework. Eilenberg & Mac Lane at first gave a purely\nabstract definition of a category, along the lines of the axiomatic\ndefinition of a group. Others, starting with Grothendieck (1957) and\nFreyd (1964), elected for reasons of practicality to define categories\nin set-theoretic terms.  \n\nAn alternative approach, that of Lawvere (1963, 1966), begins by\ncharacterizing the category of categories, and then stipulates that a\ncategory is an object of that universe. This approach, under active\ndevelopment by various mathematicians, logicians and mathematical\nphysicists, lead to what are now called “higher-dimensional\ncategories” (Baez 1997, Baez & Dolan 1998a, Batanin 1998, Leinster\n2002, Hermida et al. 2000, 2001, 2002). The very definition\nof a category is not without philosophical importance, since one of\nthe objections to category theory as a foundational framework is the\nclaim that since categories are defined as sets, category\ntheory cannot provide a philosophically enlightening foundation for\nmathematics. We will briefly go over some of these definitions,\nstarting with Eilenberg’s & Mac Lane’s (1945) algebraic\ndefinition. However, before going any further, the following\ndefinition will be required. Definition: A mapping \\(e\\) will be called an\nidentity if and only if the existence of any product\n\\(e\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta e\\) implies that \\(e\\alpha = \\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta e = \\beta\\) \nHere is the original definition of a category. \n\nDefinition (Eilenberg & Mac Lane 1945): A\ncategory \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is an aggregate \\(\\mathbf{Ob}\\) of\nabstract elements, called the objects of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\),\nand abstract elements Map, called mappings of\nthe category. The mappings are subject to the following five\naxioms: (C1) Given three mappings \\(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\) and\n\\(\\alpha_3\\), the triple product \\(\\alpha_3 (\\alpha_2\\alpha_1)\\) is\ndefined if and only if \\((\\alpha_3\\alpha_2)\\alpha_1\\) is defined.\nWhen either is defined, the associative law \n\nholds. This triple product is written\n\\(\\alpha_3\\alpha_2\\alpha_1.\\)  \n\n(C2) The triple product\n\\(\\alpha_3\\alpha_2\\alpha_1\\) is defined\nwhenever both products \\(\\alpha_3\\alpha_2\\) and\n\\(\\alpha_2\\alpha_1\\) are defined. \n\n(C3) For each mapping \\(\\alpha\\), there is at least one identity\n\\(e_1\\) such that \\(\\alpha e_1\\) is\ndefined, and at least one identity \\(e_2\\) such that\n\\(e_2\\alpha\\) is defined. \n\n(C4) The mapping \\(e_X\\) corresponding to each object\n\\(X\\) is an identity. \n\n(C5) For each identity \\(e\\) there is a unique object\n\\(X\\) of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) such that \\(e_X = e.\\) \n\nAs Eilenberg & Mac Lane promptly remark, objects play a\nsecondary role and could be entirely omitted from the definition.\nDoing so, however, would make the manipulation of the applications\nless convenient. It is practically suitable, and perhaps\npsychologically more simple to think in terms of mappings and\nobjects. The term “aggregate” is used by Eilenberg &\nMac Lane themselves, presumably so as to remain neutral with\nrespect to the background set theory one wants to adopt. \n\nEilenberg & Mac Lane defined categories in 1945 for reasons\nof rigor. As they note: \n\nThings changed in the following ten years, when categories started\nto be used in algebraic topology and homological algebra. Mac Lane,\nBuchsbaum, Grothendieck and Heller were considering categories in which\nthe collections of morphisms between two fixed objects have an additional\nstructure. More specifically, given any two objects \\(X\\) and\n\\(Y\\) of a category \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), the set\n\\(\\mathbf{Hom}(X, Y)\\) of morphisms from\n\\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) form an abelian group. Furthermore, for\nreasons related to the ways homology and cohomology theories are\nlinked, the definition of a category had to satisfy an additional\nformal property (which we will leave aside for the moment): it had to\nbe self-dual. These requirements lead to the following definition. Morphism : For every pair \\(X,\nY\\) of objects, there is a set \\(\\mathbf{Hom}(X,\nY)\\), called the morphisms from \\(X\\) to\n\\(Y\\) in \\(\\mathbf{C}.\\) If \\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\) is a\nmorphism from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\), we write\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f} : X \\rightarrow Y.\\)  \n\nIdentity : For every object \\(X\\), there exists\na morphism \\(\\mathbf{id}_X\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{Hom}(X, X)\\), called the\nidentity on \\(X.\\) \n\nComposition : For every triple \\(X,\nY\\) and \\(Z\\) of objects, there exists a partial binary\noperation from \\(\\mathbf{Hom}(X, Y) \\times \\mathbf{Hom}(Y, Z)\\) to\n\\(\\mathbf{Hom}(X, Z)\\), called the composition of\nmorphisms in \\(\\mathbf{C}.\\) If\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y\\) and\n\\(\\boldsymbol{g}: Y \\rightarrow Z\\), the\ncomposition of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) is notated\n\\((\\boldsymbol{g} \\circ \\boldsymbol{f}): X \\rightarrow Z.\\) \n\nIdentity, morphisms, and composition satisfy two axioms: \n\nIdentity : If \\(\\boldsymbol{f}:\nX \\rightarrow Y\\), then \\((\\mathbf{id}_Y \\circ \\mathbf{f}) = \\boldsymbol{f}\\) and\n\\((\\boldsymbol{f} \\circ \\id_X) = \\boldsymbol{f}.\\) \n\nThis is the definition one finds in most textbooks of category\ntheory. As such it explicitly relies on a set theoretical background\nand language. An alternative, suggested by Lawvere in the early\nsixties, is to develop an adequate language and background framework\nfor a category of categories. We will not present the formal framework\nhere, for it would take us too far from our main concern, but the\nbasic idea is to define what are called weak \\(n\\)-categories\n(and weak \\(\\omega\\)-categories), and what had been called categories\nwould then be called weak 1-categories (and sets would be weak\n0-categories). (See, for instance, Baez 1997, Makkai 1998, Leinster\n2004, Baez & May 2010, Simpson 2011.) \n\nAlso in the sixties, Lambek proposed to look at categories as\ndeductive systems. This begins with the notion of a graph,\nconsisting of two classes Arrows and Objects, and\ntwo mappings between them, \\(\\boldsymbol{s}: \\Arrows \\rightarrow\n\\Objects\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{t}: \\Arrows \\rightarrow \\Objects\\),\nnamely the source and the target mappings. The arrows are usually\ncalled the “oriented edges” and the objects\n“nodes” or “vertices”. Following this,\na deductive system is a graph with a specified arrow: (R1) \\(\\mathbf{id}_X : X \\rightarrow X\\), \n\nand a binary operation on arrows:  (R2) Given \\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{g}: Y \\rightarrow Z\\), the composition of \\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\) and\n\\(\\boldsymbol{g}\\) is \\((\\boldsymbol{g} \\circ \\boldsymbol{f}): X \\rightarrow Z.\\) \n\nOf course, the objects of a deductive system are normally thought of\nas formulas, the arrows are thought of as proofs or\ndeductions, and operations on arrows are thought of as\nrules of inference. A category is then defined\nthus: \nDefinition (Lambek): A category is a\ndeductive system in which the following equations hold between proofs:\nfor all \\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y, \\boldsymbol{g}: Y \\rightarrow Z\\) and\n\\(\\boldsymbol{h}: Z \\rightarrow W\\), (E1) \\(\\boldsymbol{f} \\circ \\id_X = \\boldsymbol{f}\\),   \\(\\mathbf{id}_Y \\circ \\boldsymbol{f} = \\boldsymbol{f}\\),   \\(\\boldsymbol{h} \\circ \n (\\boldsymbol{g} \\circ \\boldsymbol{f}) = (\\boldsymbol{h} \\circ \\boldsymbol{g})\n \\circ \\boldsymbol{f}.\\) \n\nThus, by imposing an adequate equivalence relation upon proofs, any\ndeductive system can be turned into a category. It is therefore\nlegitimate to think of a category as an algebraic encoding of a\ndeductive system. This phenomenon is already well-known to logicians,\nbut probably not to its fullest extent. An example of such an\nalgebraic encoding is the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra, a Boolean algebra\ncorresponding to classical propositional logic. Since a Boolean\nalgebra is a poset, it is also a category. (Notice also that Boolean\nalgebras with appropriate homomorphisms between them form another\nuseful category in logic.) Thus far we have merely a change of\nvocabulary. Things become more interesting when first-order and\nhigher-order logics are considered. The Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra for\nthese systems, when properly carried out, yields categories, sometimes\ncalled “conceptual categories” or “syntactic categories”\n(Mac Lane & Moerdijk 1992, Makkai & Reyes 1977, Pitts\n2000). \n\nAlmost every known example of a mathematical structure with the\nappropriate structure-preserving map yields a category.  \n\nThese examples nicely illustrates how category theory treats the\nnotion of structure in a uniform manner. Note that a category is\ncharacterized by its morphisms, and not by its objects. Thus the\ncategory of topological spaces with open maps differs from the\ncategory of topological spaces with continuous maps — or, more\nto the point, the categorical properties of the latter differ from\nthose of the former. \n\nWe should underline again the fact that not all categories are made\nof structured sets with structure-preserving maps. Thus any preordered\nset is a category. For given two elements \\(p, q\\) of a\npreordered set, there is a morphism\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f}: p \\rightarrow q\\) if and only if\n\\(p \\le q.\\) Hence a preordered set is a category in which there\nis at most one morphism between any two objects. Any monoid (and thus\nany group) can be seen as a category: in this case the category has\nonly one object, and its morphisms are the elements of the monoid.\nComposition of morphisms corresponds to multiplication of monoid\nelements. That the monoid axioms correspond to the category axioms is\neasily verified. \n\nHence the notion of category generalizes those of preorder and\nmonoid. We should also point out that a groupoid has a very simple\ndefinition in a categorical context: it is a category in which every\nmorphism is an isomorphism, that is for any morphism\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y\\),\nthere is a morphism \\(\\boldsymbol{g}: Y \\rightarrow X\\) such that\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f} \\circ \\boldsymbol{g} = \\mathbf{id}_X\\) and\n\\(\\boldsymbol{g} \\circ \\boldsymbol{f} = \\mathbf{id}_Y.\\) \n\nCategory theory unifies mathematical structures in two different ways.\nFirst, as we have seen, almost every set theoretically defined\nmathematical structure with the appropriate notion of homomorphism\nyields a category. This is a unification provided within a set\ntheoretical environment. Second, and perhaps even more important, once\na type of structure has been defined, it is imperative to determine how\nnew structures can be constructed out of the given one. For instance,\ngiven two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), set theory allows us to\nconstruct their Cartesian product \\(A \\times B.\\) It is also\nimperative to determine how given structures can be decomposed into\nmore elementary substructures. For example, given a finite Abelian\ngroup, how can it be decomposed into a product of certain of its\nsubgroups? In both cases, it is necessary to know how structures of a\ncertain kind may combine. The nature of these combinations might appear\nto be considerably different when looked at from a purely set\ntheoretical perspective.  \n\nCategory theory reveals that many of these constructions are in fact\ncertain objects in a category having a “universal property”. Indeed,\nfrom a categorical point of view, a Cartesian product in set theory, a\ndirect product of groups (Abelian or otherwise), a product of\ntopological spaces, and a conjunction of propositions in a deductive\nsystem are all instances of a categorical product characterized by a\nuniversal property. Formally, a product of two objects\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in a category \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is an object\n\\(Z\\) of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) together with two morphisms,\ncalled the projections, \\(\\boldsymbol{p}: Z \\rightarrow X\\) and \n\\(\\boldsymbol{q}: Z \\rightarrow Y\\)\nsuch that—and this is the universal property—for all\nobjects \\(W\\) with morphisms \\(\\boldsymbol{f}: W \\rightarrow X\\)\nand \\(\\boldsymbol{g}: W \\rightarrow Y\\),\nthere is a unique morphism\n\\(\\boldsymbol{h}: W \\rightarrow Z\\) such that\n\\(\\boldsymbol{p} \\circ \\boldsymbol{h} = \\boldsymbol{f}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{q} \\circ \\boldsymbol{h} = \\boldsymbol{g}.\\) \n\nNote that we have defined \\(a\\) product for \\(X\\) and\n\\(Y\\) and not the product for \\(X\\) and \\(Y.\\)\nIndeed, products and other objects with a universal property are\ndefined only up to a (unique) isomorphism. Thus in category theory,\nthe nature of the elements constituting a certain construction is\nirrelevant. What matters is the way an object is related to the other\nobjects of the category, that is, the morphisms going in and the\nmorphisms going out, or, put differently, how certain structures can\nbe mapped into a given object and how a given object can map its\nstructure into other structures of the same kind. \n\nCategory theory reveals how different kinds of structures are\nrelated to one another. For instance, in algebraic topology,\ntopological spaces are related to groups (and modules, rings, etc.) in\nvarious ways (such as homology, cohomology, homotopy, K-theory). As noted\nabove, groups with group homomorphisms constitute a category. Eilenberg\n& Mac Lane invented category theory precisely in order to\nclarify and compare these connections. What matters are the morphisms\nbetween categories, given by functors. Informally, functors are\nstructure-preserving maps between categories. Given two categories\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), a functor \\(F\\) from\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) sends objects of\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to objects of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), and morphisms of\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to morphisms of \\(\\mathbf{D}\\), in such a way\nthat composition of morphisms in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is preserved, i.e.,\n\\(F(\\boldsymbol{g} \\circ \\boldsymbol{f}) = F(\\boldsymbol{g})\n \\circ F(\\boldsymbol{f})\\),\nand identity morphisms are preserved, i.e.,\n\\(F(\\mathbf{id}_X ) = \\mathbf{id}_{FX}.\\) It immediately follows that\na functor preserves commutativity of diagrams between categories.\nHomology, cohomology, homotopy, K-theory are all example of\nfunctors. \n\nA more direct example is provided by the power set operation, which\nyields two functors on the category of sets, depending on how one\ndefines its action on functions. Thus given a set \\(X,\n\\wp(X)\\) is the usual set of subsets of \\(X\\), and\ngiven a function \\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y, \\wp(\\boldsymbol{f}):\n\\wp(X) \\rightarrow \\wp(Y)\\) takes a subset\n\\(A\\) of \\(X\\) and maps it to \\(B = \\boldsymbol{f}(A)\\), the image of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\) restricted to \\(A\\) in \\(X.\\) It\nis easily verified that this defines a functor from the category of\nsets into itself. \n\nIn general, there are many functors between two given categories, and\nthe question of how they are connected suggests itself. For instance, given a\ncategory \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), there is always the identity functor from\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) which sends every\nobject/morphism of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to itself. In particular, there\nis the identity functor over the category of sets. \n\nNow, the identity functor is related in a natural manner to the power set functor\ndescribed above. Indeed, given a set \\(X\\) and\nits power set \\(\\wp(X)\\), there is a function\n\\(\\mathbf{h}_X\\) which takes an element\n\\(x\\) of \\(X\\) and sends it to the singleton set \\(\\{x\\}\\),\na subset of \\(X\\), i.e., an element of \\(\\wp(X).\\) This\nfunction in fact belongs to a family of functions indexed by the\nobjects of the category of sets\n\\(\\{\\mathbf{h}_Y : Y \\rightarrow \\wp(X)| Y \\text{ in } \\mathbf{Ob(Set)}\\}.\\)\nMoreover, it satisfies the following commutativity condition: given any\nfunction \\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y\\), the\nidentity functor yields the same function\n\\(\\boldsymbol{Id}(\\boldsymbol{f}):\n\\boldsymbol{Id}(X) \\rightarrow \\boldsymbol{Id}(Y).\\) The commutativity condition\nthus becomes: \\(\\mathbf{h}_Y \\circ \\boldsymbol{Id}(\\boldsymbol{f}) = \\wp(\\boldsymbol{f})\n \\circ \\mathbf{h}_X.\\)\nThus the family of functions \\(\\boldsymbol{h}({\\text{-}})\\) relates the\ntwo functors in a natural manner. Such families of morphisms are called\nnatural transformations between functors. Similarly, natural\ntransformations between models of a theory yield the usual\nhomomorphisms of structures in the traditional set theoretical\nframework. \n\nThe above notions, while important, are not fundamental to category\ntheory. The latter heading arguably include the notions of\nlimit/colimit; in turn, these are special cases of what is certainly\nthe cornerstone of category theory, the concept of adjoint functors,\nfirst defined by Daniel Kan in 1956 and published in 1958. \n\nAdjoint functors can be thought of as being conceptual inverses.\nThis is probably best illustrated by an example. Let\n\\(U: \\mathbf{Grp} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{Set}\\)\nbe the forgetful functor, that is, the functor that sends to each\ngroup \\(G\\) its underlying set of\nelements \\(U(G)\\), and to a group\nhomomorphism \\(\\boldsymbol{f}: G \\rightarrow H\\) the underlying set function\n\\(U(\\boldsymbol{f}): U(G) \\rightarrow U(H).\\) In other words, \\(U\\) forgets about the\ngroup structure and forgets the fact that morphisms are group\nhomomorphisms. The categories \\(\\mathbf{Grp}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{Set}\\) are certainly not isomorphic, as categories, to\none another. (A simple argument runs as follows: the category\n\\(\\mathbf{Grp}\\) has a zero object, whereas \\(\\mathbf{Set}\\)\ndoes not.) Thus, we certainly cannot find an inverse, in the usual\nalgebraic sense, to the functor \\(U.\\) But there are many\nnon-isomorphic ways to define a group structure on a given set\n\\(X\\), and one might hope that among these constructions at least\none is functorial and systematically related to the functor \\(U.\\)\nWhat is the conceptual inverse to the operation of forgetting all the\ngroup theoretical structure and obtaining a set? It is to construct a\ngroup from a set solely on the basis of the concept of group and\nnothing else, i.e., with no extraneous relation or data. Such a group is\nconstructed “freely”; that is, with no restriction whatsoever except\nthose imposed by the axioms of the theory. In other words, all that is\nremembered in the process of constructing a group from a given set is\nthe fact that the resulting construction has to be a group. Such a\nconstruction exists; it is functorial and it yields what are called\nfree groups. In other words, there is a functor\n\\(F: \\mathbf{Set} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{Grp}\\),\nwhich to any set \\(X\\) assigns the free group\n\\(F(X)\\) on \\(X\\), and to each function\n\\(\\boldsymbol{f}: X \\rightarrow Y\\), the group\nhomomorphism \\(F(\\boldsymbol{f}): F(X) \\rightarrow F(Y)\\), defined in the\nobvious manner. The situation can be described thusly: we have two\nconceptual contexts, a group theoretical context and a set theoretical\ncontext, and two functors moving systematically from one context to the\nother in opposite directions. One of these functors is elementary,\nnamely the forgetful functor \\(U.\\) It is apparently trivial and\nuninformative. The other functor is mathematically significant and\nimportant. The surprising fact is that \\(F\\) is related to\n\\(U\\) by a simple rule and, in some sense, it arises from\n\\(U.\\) One of the striking features of adjoint situations is\nprecisely the fact that fundamental mathematical and logical\nconstructions arise out of given and often elementary functors. \n\nThe fact that \\(U\\) and \\(F\\) are conceptual inverses\nexpresses itself formally as follows: applying \\(F\\) first and\nthen \\(U\\) does not yield the original set \\(X\\), but there\nis a fundamental relationship between \\(X\\) and\n\\(UF(X).\\) Indeed, there is a function \\(\\eta\\):\n\\(X \\rightarrow UF(X)\\), called the unit of the\nadjunction, that simply sends each element of \\(X\\) to itself\nin \\(UF(X)\\) and this function satisfies the following\nuniversal property: given any function\n\\(\\boldsymbol{g}: X \\rightarrow U(G)\\), there is a unique group homomorphism\n\\(\\boldsymbol{h}: F(X) \\rightarrow G\\) such that \\(U(\\boldsymbol{h})\n \\circ \\eta = \\boldsymbol{g}.\\) In other words, \\(UF(X)\\) is\nthe best possible solution to the problem of inserting elements of\n\\(X\\) into a group (what is called “insertion of generators” in\nthe mathematical jargon). Composing \\(U\\) and \\(F\\) in the\nopposite order, we get a morphism \\(\\xi : FU(G)\n\\rightarrow G\\), called the counit of the adjunction,\nsatisfying the following universal property: for any group homomorphism\n\\(\\boldsymbol{g}: F(X) \\rightarrow G\\), there is a unique function\n\\(\\boldsymbol{h}: X \\rightarrow U(G)\\)\nsuch that \\(\\xi \\circ F(\\boldsymbol{h}) = \\boldsymbol{g} \\circ FU(G)\\)\nconstitutes the best possible solution to the problem of finding a\nrepresentation of \\(G\\) as a quotient of a free group. If\n\\(U\\) and \\(F\\) were simple algebraic inverses to one\nanother, we would have the following identity: \\(UF = I_{\\mathbf{Set}}\\) and \\(FU = I_{\\mathbf{Grp}}\\), where\n\\(I_{\\mathbf{Set}}\\) denotes the identity functor\non \\(\\mathbf{Set}\\) and \\(I_{\\mathbf{Grp}}\\)\nthe identity functor on \\(\\mathbf{Grp}.\\) As we have indicated,\nthese identities certainly do not hold in this case. However, some\nidentities do hold: they are best expressed with the help of the\ncommutative diagrams: \n\nwhere the diagonal arrows denote the appropriate identity natural\ntransformations. \n\nThis is but one case of a very common situation: every free\nconstruction can be described as arising from an appropriate forgetful\nfunctor between two adequately chosen categories. The number of\nmathematical constructions that can be described as adjoints is simply\nstunning. Although the details of each one of these constructions vary\nconsiderably, the fact that they can all be described using the same\nlanguage illustrates the profound unity of mathematical concepts and\nmathematical thinking. Before we give more examples, a formal and\nabstract definition of adjoint functors is in order. \nDefinition: Let \\(F: \\mathbf{C} \\rightarrow\n\\mathbf{D}\\) and \\(G: \\mathbf{D} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}\\) be functors\ngoing in opposite directions. \\(F\\) is a left adjoint to \\(G\n(G\\) a right adjoint to \\(F)\\), denoted by \\(F \\dashv G\\), if\nthere exists natural transformations \\(\\eta : I_{\\mathbf{C}}\n\\rightarrow GF\\) and \\(\\xi: FG \\rightarrow I_{\\mathbf{D}}\\), such that\nthe composites and \nare the identity natural transformations. (For different but\nequivalent definitions, see Mac Lane 1971 or 1998, chap. IV.) \n\nHere are some of the important facts regarding adjoint functors.\nFirstly, adjoints are unique up to isomorphism; that is any two left\nadjoints \\(F\\) and F’ of a functor \\(G\\) are\nnaturally isomorphic. Secondly, the notion of adjointness is formally\nequivalent to the notion of a universal morphism (or construction) and\nto that of representable functor. (See, for instance Mac Lane\n1998, chap. IV.) Each and every one of these notions exhibit an\naspect of a given situation. Thirdly, a left adjoint preserves all the\ncolimits which exist in its domain, and, dually, a right adjoint\npreserves all the limits which exist in its domain. \n\nWe now give some examples of adjoint situations to illustrate the\npervasiveness of the notion. \n where the vertical double arrow can be interpreted as rules of\ninference going in both directions. \n\nIt is easy to prove certain facts about these operations directly from\nthe adjunctions. Consider, for instance, implication. Let \\(Z = X.\\) Then we get at the numerator that \\(Y \\wedge X \\le X\\),\nwhich is always true in a poset (as is easily verified). Hence,\n\\(Y \\le X \\Rightarrow X\\) is also true for\nall \\(Y\\) and this is only possible if \\(X \\Rightarrow X = \\top\\), the top element of the lattice. Not only\ncan logical operations be described as adjoints, but they naturally\narise as adjoints to basic operations. In fact, adjoints can be used\nto define various structures, distributive lattices, Heyting algebras,\nBoolean algebras, etc. (See Wood, 2004.) It should be clear from the\nsimple foregoing example how the formalism of adjointness can be used\nto give syntactic presentations of various logical\ntheories. Furthermore, and this is a key element, the standard\nuniversal and existential quantifiers can be shown to be arising as\nadjoints to the operation of substitution. Thus, quantifiers are on a\npar with the other logical operations, in sharp contrast with the\nother algebraic approaches to logic. (See, for instance Awodey 1996 or\nMac Lane & Moerdijk 1992.) More generally, Lawvere showed\nhow syntax and semantics are related by adjoint functors. (See Lawvere\n1969b.) \n\nDualities play an important role in mathematics and they can be\ndescribed with the help of equivalences between categories. In other\nwords, many important mathematical theorems can be translated as\nstatements about the existence of adjoint functors, sometimes\nsatisfying additional properties. This is sometimes taken as\nexpressing the conceptual content of the theorem. Consider\nthe following fundamental case: let \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) be the category\nwhose objects are the locally compact abelian groups and the morphisms\nare the continuous group homomorphisms. Then, the Pontryagin duality\ntheorem amounts to the claim that the category \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is\nequivalent to the category \\(\\mathbf{C}\\)°, that is, to the\nopposite category. Of course, the precise statement requires that we\ndescribe the functors \\(F: \\mathbf{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}\\)° and \\(G: \\mathbf{C}\\)° \\(\\rightarrow \\mathbf{C}\\) and prove that they constitute an equivalence of\ncategories. \n\nAnother well known and important duality was discovered by Stone in\nthe thirties and now bears his name. In one direction, an arbitrary\nBoolean algebra yields a topological space, and in the other\ndirection, from a (compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected)\ntopological space, one obtains a Boolean algebra. Moreover, this\ncorrespondence is functorial: any Boolean homomorphism is sent to a\ncontinuous map of topological spaces, and, conversely, any continuous\nmap between the spaces is sent to a Boolean homomorphism. In other\nwords, there is an equivalence of categories between the category of\nBoolean algebras and the dual of the category of Boolean spaces (also\ncalled Stone spaces). (See Johnstone 1982 for an excellent\nintroduction and more developments.) The connection between a category\nof algebraic structures and the opposite of a category of topological\nstructures established by Stone’s theorem constitutes but one example\nof a general phenomenon that did attract and still attracts a great\ndeal of attention from category theorists. Categorical study of\nduality theorems is still a very active and significant field, and is\nlargely inspired by Stone’s result. (For recent applications in logic,\nsee, for instance Makkai 1987, Taylor 2000, 2002a, 2002b, Caramello 2011.) \n\nIt is difficult to do justice to the short but intricate history of the\nfield. In particular it is not possible to mention all those who have\ncontributed to its rapid development. With this word of caution out of\nthe way, we will look at some of the main historical threads.  \n\nCategories, functors, natural transformations, limits and colimits\nappeared almost out of nowhere in a paper by Eilenberg &\nMac Lane (1945) entitled “General Theory of Natural\nEquivalences.” We say “almost,” because their earlier paper (1942)\ncontains specific functors and natural transformations at work,\nlimited to groups. A desire to clarify and abstract their 1942 results\nled Eilenberg & Mac Lane to devise category theory. The\ncentral notion at the time, as their title indicates, was that of\nnatural transformation. In order to give a general definition of the\nlatter, they defined functor, borrowing the term from Carnap, and in\norder to define functor, they borrowed the word ‘category’\nfrom the philosophy of Aristotle, Kant, and C. S. Peirce, but\nredefining it mathematically. \n\nAfter their 1945 paper, it was not clear that the concepts of category\ntheory would amount to more than a convenient language; this indeed\nwas the status quo for about fifteen years. Category theory was\nemployed in this manner by Eilenberg & Steenrod (1952), in an\ninfluential book on the foundations of algebraic topology, and by\nCartan & Eilenberg (1956), in a ground breaking book on\nhomological algebra. (Curiously, although Eilenberg & Steenrod\ndefined categories, Cartan & Eilenberg simply assumed them!) These\nbooks allowed new generations of mathematicians to learn algebraic\ntopology and homological algebra directly in the categorical language,\nand to master the method of diagrams. Indeed, without the method of\ndiagram chasing, many results in these two books seem inconceivable,\nor at the very least would have required a considerably more intricate\npresentation. \n\nThe situation changed radically with Grothendieck’s (1957) landmark\npaper entitled “Sur quelques points d’algèbre homologique”, in\nwhich the author employed categories intrinsically to define and\nconstruct more general theories which he (Grothendieck 1957) then\napplied to specific fields, e.g., to algebraic geometry. Kan (1958)\nshowed that adjoint functors subsume the important concepts of limits\nand colimits and could capture fundamental concepts in other areas (in\nhis case, homotopy theory). \n\nAt this point, category theory became more than a convenient\nlanguage, by virtue of two developments. \n\nWith these developments, category theory became an autonomous field of\nresearch, and pure category theory could be developed. And indeed, it\ndid grow rapidly as a discipline, but also in its applications, mainly\nin its source contexts, namely algebraic topology and homological\nalgebra, but also in algebraic geometry and, after the appearance of\nLawvere’s Ph.D. thesis, in universal algebra. This thesis also\nconstitutes a landmark in this history of the field, for in it Lawvere\nproposed the category of categories as a foundation for category\ntheory, set theory and, thus, the whole of mathematics, as well as\nusing categories for the study of the logical aspects of\nmathematics. \n\nOver the course of the 1960s, Lawvere outlined the basic framework\nfor an entirely original approach to logic and the foundations of\nmathematics. He achieved the following: \n Meanwhile, Lambek (1968, 1969, 1972) described categories in terms of\ndeductive systems and employed categorical methods for\nproof-theoretical purposes.  \n\nAll this work culminated in another notion, thanks to Grothendieck and\nhis school: that of a topos. Even though toposes appeared in\nthe 1960s, in the context of algebraic geometry, again from the mind\nof Grothendieck, it was certainly Lawvere and Tierney’s (1972)\nelementary axiomatization of a topos which gave impetus to its\nattaining foundational status. Very roughly, an elementary topos is a\ncategory possessing a logical structure sufficiently rich to develop\nmost of “ordinary mathematics”, that is, most of what is\ntaught to mathematics undergraduates. As such, an elementary topos can\nbe thought of as a categorical theory of sets. But it is also a\ngeneralized topological space, thus providing a direct connection\nbetween logic and geometry. (For more on the history of categorical\nlogic, see Marquis & Reyes 2012, Bell 2005.)  \n\nThe 1970s saw the development and application of the topos concept in\nmany different directions. The very first applications outside\nalgebraic geometry were in set theory, where various independence\nresults were recast in terms of topos (Tierney 1972, Bunge 1974, but\nalso Blass & Scedrov 1989, Blass & Scedrov 1992, Freyd 1980,\nMac Lane & Moerdijk 1992, Scedrov 1984). Connections with\nintuitionistic and, more generally constructive mathematics were noted\nearly on, and toposes are still used to investigate models of various\naspects of intuitionism and constructivism (Lambek & Scott 1986,\nMac Lane & Moerdijk 1992, Van der Hoeven & Moerdijk\n1984a, 1984b, 1984c, Moerdijk 1984, Moerdijk 1995a, Moerdijk 1998,\nMoerdijk & Palmgren 1997, Moerdijk & Palmgren 2002, Palmgren\n2012, Palmgren 2018. For more on the history of topos theory, see McLarty 1992 and Bell 2012). \n\nMore recently, topos theory has been employed to investigate various\nforms of constructive mathematics or set theory (Joyal & Moerdijk\n1995, Taylor 1996, Awodey 2008), recursiveness, and models of\nhigher-order type theories generally. The introduction of the\nso-called “effective topos” and the search for axioms for\nsynthetic domain theory are worth mentioning (Hyland 1982, Hyland\n1988, 1991, Hyland et al. 1990, McLarty 1992, Jacobs\n1999, Van Oosten 2008, Van Oosten 2002 and the references\ntherein). Lawvere’s early motivation was to provide a new foundation\nfor differential geometry, a lively research area which is now called\n“synthetic differential geometry” (Lawvere 2000, 2002,\nKock 2006, Bell 1988, 1995, 1998, 2001, Moerdijk & Reyes\n1991). This is only the tip of the iceberg; toposes could prove to be\nfor the 21st century what Lie groups were to the 20th century. \n\nFrom the 1980s to the present, category theory has found new\napplications. In theoretical computer science, category theory is now\nfirmly rooted, and contributes, among other things, to the development\nof new logical systems and to the semantics of programming. (Pitts\n2000, Plotkin 2000, Scott 2000, and the references therein). Its\napplications to mathematics are becoming more diverse, even touching\non theoretical physics, which employs higher-dimensional category\ntheory — which is to category theory what higher-dimensional\ngeometry is to plane geometry — to study the so-called “quantum\ngroups” and quantum field theory (Majid 1995, Baez & Dolan 2001 and other\npublications by these authors). \n\nCategory theory challenges philosophers in two ways, which are not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive. On the one hand, it is certainly the\ntask of philosophy to clarify the general epistemological and\nontological status of categories and categorical methods, both in the\npractice of mathematics and in the foundational landscape. On the\nother hand, philosophers and philosophical logicians can employ\ncategory theory and categorical logic to explore philosophical and\nlogical problems. I now discuss these challenges, briefly, in turn. \n\nCategory theory is now a common tool in the mathematician’s\ntoolbox; that much is clear. It is also clear that category theory\norganizes and unifies much of mathematics. Contemporary mathematical\nfields would not be what they are without category theory, for\ninstance algebraic topology, homological algebra, homotopy theory and\nhomotopical algebra, representation theory, arithmetic geometry and\nalgebraic geometry. (See for instance Mac Lane 1971, 1998 or\nPedicchio & Tholen 2004.) No one will deny these simple facts.\nFurthermore, vast portions of contemporary mathematics now rest on a\ndifferent practice which rely, in large part, on the manipulation of\nnew graphical notations, on the one hand, and on different levels of\nabstraction, on the other hand. It is not simply that category theory\nand the mathematical disciplines developed within that framework use\ncommutative diagrams, although this in itself leads to some\ninteresting philosophical explorations, as for instance in De Toffoli\n2017, but category theorists have seen the need to develop systematic\nand formal graphical languages to express directly various forms of\nargumentations. (See, for instance, Joyal & Street 1993; Joyal,\nStreet & Verity 1996; Fong & Spivak 2019, Other Internet\nResources.) Whereas since\nBourbaki, mathematics was done “up to isomorphism”, in\nsome cases, it is now done “up to equivalence” or up to\n“bi-equivalence” or even up to\n“n-equivalence”. (For an attempt at clarifying what these\nlevels of abstraction mean, see Marquis 2014, Marquis 2016.) \n\nDoing mathematics in a categorical framework is almost always\nradically different from doing it in a set-theoretical framework (the\nexception being working with the internal language of a Boolean topos;\nwhenever the topos is not Boolean, then the main difference lies in\nthe fact that the logic is intuitionistic). Hence, as is\noften the case when a different conceptual framework is adopted, many\nbasic issues regarding the nature of the objects studied, the nature\nof the knowledge involved, and the nature of the methods used have to\nbe reevaluated. We will take up these three aspects in turn. \n\nTwo facets of the nature of mathematical objects within a categorical\nframework have to be emphasized. First, objects are always given in a\ncategory. An object exists in and depends upon an ambient\ncategory. Furthermore, an object is characterized by the morphisms\ngoing in it and/or the morphisms coming out of it. Second, objects are\nalways characterized up to isomorphism (in the best cases, up to a\nunique isomorphism). There is no such thing, for instance, as\nthe natural numbers. However, it can be argued that there is\nsuch a thing as the concept of natural numbers. Indeed, the\nconcept of natural numbers can be given unambiguously, via the\nDedekind-Peano-Lawvere axioms, but what this concept refers to in\nspecific cases depends on the context in which it is interpreted,\ne.g., the category of sets or a topos of sheaves over a topological\nspace. Thus, it seems that sense does not determine reference in a\ncategorical context. It is hard to resist the temptation to think that\ncategory theory embodies a form of structuralism, that it describes\nmathematical objects as structures since the latter, presumably, are\nalways characterized up to isomorphism. Thus, the key here has to do\nwith the kind of criterion of identity at work within a categorical\nframework and how it resembles any criterion given for objects which\nare thought of as forms in general. One of the standard objections\npresented against this view is that if objects are thought of as\nstructures and only as abstract structures, meaning here that\nthey are separated from any specific or concrete representation, then\nit is impossible to locate them within the mathematical universe. (See\nHellman 2003 for a standard formulation of the objection, McLarty\n1993, Awodey 2004, Landry & Marquis 2005, Shapiro 2005, Landry\n2011, Linnebo & Pettigrew 2011, Hellman 2011, Shapiro 2011,\nMcLarty 2011, Logan 2015 for relevant material on the issue.) \n\nA slightly different way to make\nsense of the situation is to think of mathematical objects as\ntypes for which there are tokens given in different\ncontexts. This is strikingly different from the situation one finds in\nset theory, in which mathematical objects are defined uniquely and\ntheir reference is given directly. Although one can make room for\ntypes within set theory via equivalence classes or isomorphism types\nin general, the basic criterion of identity within that\nframework is given by the axiom of extensionality and thus,\nultimately, reference is made to specific sets. Furthermore, it can\nbe argued that the relation between a type and its token is\nnot represented adequately by the membership relation. A\ntoken does not belong to a type, it is not an element of a type, but\nrather it is an instance of it. In a categorical framework, one always\nrefers to a token of a type, and what the theory\ncharacterizes directly is the type, not the tokens. In this framework,\none does not have to locate a type, but tokens of it are, at least in\nmathematics, epistemologically required. This is simply the reflection\nof the interaction between the abstract and the concrete in the\nepistemological sense (and not the ontological sense of these latter\nexpressions.) (See Ellerman 1988, Ellerman 2017, Marquis 2000, Marquis\n2006, Marquis 2013.) \n\nThe history of category theory offers a rich source of information to\nexplore and take into account for an historically sensitive\nepistemology of mathematics. It is hard to imagine, for instance, how\nalgebraic geometry and algebraic topology could have become what they\nare now without categorical tools. (See, for instance, Carter 2008,\nCorfield 2003, Krömer 2007, Marquis 2009, McLarty 1994, McLarty\n2006.) Category theory has lead to reconceptualizations of various\nareas of mathematics based on purely abstract foundations. Moreover,\nwhen developed in a categorical framework, traditional boundaries\nbetween disciplines are shattered and reconfigured; to mention but one\nimportant example, topos theory provides a direct bridge between\nalgebraic geometry and logic, to the point where certain results in\nalgebraic geometry are directly translated into logic and vice versa.\nCertain concepts that were geometrical in origin are more clearly seen\nas logical (for example, the notion of coherent topos). Algebraic\ntopology also lurks in the background. (See, for instance, Caramello\n2018 for a systematic exploitation of the idea of toposes as bridges\nin mathematics.) On a different but important front, it can be argued\nthat the distinction between mathematics and metamathematics cannot be\narticulated in the way it has been. All these issues have to be\nreconsidered and reevaluated. \n\nMoving closer to mathematical practice, category theory allowed for\nthe development of methods that have changed and continue to change\nthe face of mathematics. It could be argued that category theory\nrepresents the culmination of one of deepest and most powerful\ntendencies in twentieth century mathematical thought: the search for\nthe most general and abstract ingredients in a given\nsituation. Category theory is, in this sense, the legitimate heir of\nthe Dedekind-Hilbert-Noether-Bourbaki tradition, with its emphasis on\nthe axiomatic method and algebraic structures. (For a different\nreading, see Rodin 2014.) When used to characterize a specific\nmathematical domain, category theory reveals the frame upon which that\narea is built, the overall structure presiding to its stability,\nstrength and coherence. The structure of this specific area, in a\nsense, might not need to rest on anything, that is, on some solid\nsoil, for it might very well be just one part of a larger network that\nis without any Archimedean point, as if floating in space. To use a\nwell-known metaphor: from a categorical point of view, Neurath’s\nship has become a spaceship. \n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether category theory should be “on the\nsame plane,” so to speak, as set theory, whether it should be taken as\na serious alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics,\nor whether it is foundational in a different sense altogether. (That\nthis very question applies even more forcefully to topos theory will\nnot detain us.) \n\nLawvere from early on promoted the idea that a category of categories\ncould be used as a foundational framework. (See Lawvere 1964, 1966.)\nThis proposal now rests in part on the development of\nhigher-dimensional categories, also called weak \\(n\\)-categories.\n(See, for instance Makkai 1998.) The advent of topos theory in the\nseventies brought new possibilities. Mac Lane has suggested\nthat certain toposes be considered as a genuine foundation for\nmathematics. (See Mac Lane 1986.) Lambek proposed the so-called\nfree topos as the best possible framework, in the sense that\nmathematicians with different philosophical outlooks might nonetheless\nagree to adopt it. (See Couture & Lambek 1991, 1992, Lambek\n1994.) He has also argued that there is no topos that can\nthoroughly satisfy a classical mathematician. (See Lambek 2004.) (For\nmore on the various foundational views among category theorists, see\nLandry & Marquis 2005.) \n\nArguments have been advanced for and against category theory as a\nfoundational framework. (Blass 1984 surveys the relationships between\ncategory theory and set theory. Feferman 1977, Bell 1981, and Hellman\n2003 argue against category theory. See Marquis 1995 for a quick\noverview and proposal and McLarty 2004 and Awodey 2004 for replies to\nHellman 2003.) The debate has advanced slowly but surely. It has been\nrecognized that it is possible to present a foundational framework in\nthe language of category theory, be it in the form of the Elementary\nTheory of the Category of Sets, ETCS, or a category of categories, of\nMakkai Structuralist foundations for abstract mathematics, SFAM. Thus,\nit seems that the community no longer question the logical and the\nconceptual autonomy of these approaches, to use the terminology\nintroduced by Linnebo & Pettigrew 2011. The main issue seems to be\nwhether one can provide a philosophically satisfying justification for\none of those framework. (See Hellman 2013, Landry 2013, Marquis 2013b,\nMcLarty 2018.) \n\nThis matter is further complicated by the fact that the foundations of\ncategory theory itself have yet to be clarified. For there may be many\ndifferent ways to think of a universe of higher-dimensional categories\nas a foundations for mathematics. It is safe to say that we now have a\ngood understanding of what are called \\((\\infty, 1)\\)-categories and important\nmathematical results have been obtained in that framework. (See, for\ninstance, Cisinski 2019 for a presentation.) An adequate language for\nthe universe of arbitrary higher-dimensional categories still has to\nbe presented together with definite axioms for mathematics. (See\nMakkai 1998 for a short description of such a language. A different\napproach based on homotopy theory but with closed connections with\nhigher-dimensional categories has been proposed by Voevodsky et\nal. and is being vigorously pursued. See the book Homotopy Type\nTheory, by Awodey et al. 2013.)  \n\nIt is an established fact that category theory is employed to study\nlogic and philosophy. Indeed, categorical logic, the study of logic by\ncategorical means, has been under way for about 40 years now and still\nvigorous. Some of the philosophically relevant results obtained in\ncategorical logic are: \n\nCategorical tools in logic offer considerable flexibility, as is\nillustrated by the fact that almost all the surprising results of\nconstructive and intuitionistic mathematics can be modeled in a proper\ncategorical setting. At the same time, the standard set-theoretic\nnotions, e.g. Tarski’s semantics, have found natural generalizations\nin categories. Thus, categorical logic has roots in logic as it was\ndeveloped in the twentieth century, while at the same time providing a\npowerful and novel framework with numerous links to other parts of\nmathematics. \n\nCategory theory also bears on more general philosophical questions.\nFrom the foregoing disussion, it should be obvious that category\ntheory and categorical logic ought to have an impact on almost all\nissues arising in philosophy of logic: from the nature of identity\ncriteria to the question of alternative logics, category theory always\nsheds a new light on these topics. Similar remarks can be made when we\nturn to ontology, in particular formal ontology: the part/whole\nrelation, boundaries of systems, ideas of space, etc. Ellerman (1988)\nhas bravely attempted to show that category theory constitutes a\ntheory of universals, one having properties radically different from\nset theory, which is also seen as a theory of universals. Moving from\nontology to cognitive science, MacNamara & Reyes (1994) have tried\nto employ categorical logic to provide a different logic of\nreference. In particular, they have attempted to clarify the\nrelationships between count nouns and mass terms. Other researchers\nare using category theory to study complex systems, cognitive neural\nnetworks, and analogies. (See, for instance, Ehresmann 2018, Ehresmann &\nVanbremeersch 1987, 2007, Healy 2000, Healy & Caudell 2006,\nArzi-Gonczarowski 1999, Brown & Porter 2006.) Finally,\nphilosophers of science have turned to category theory to shed a new\nlight on issues related to structuralism in science. (See, for\ninstance, Brading & Landry 2006, Bain 2013, Lam & Wüthrich\n2015, Eva 2016, Lal & Teh 2017, Landry 2007, 2012, 2018.) \n\nCategory theory offers thus many philosophical challenges, challenges\nwhich will hopefully be taken up in years to come.","contact.mail":"Jean-Pierre.Marquis@umontreal.ca","contact.domain":"umontreal.ca"}]
