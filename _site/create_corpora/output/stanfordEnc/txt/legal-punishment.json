Radically\ndifferent answers to this question are offered by consequentialist and\nby retributivist theorists — and by those who seek to\nincorporate consequentialist and retributivist considerations in\n‘mixed’ theories of punishment. Meanwhile, abolitionist\ntheorists argue that we should aim to replace legal punishment rather\nthan to justify it. Among the significant developments in recent work\non punishment theory are the characterisation of punishment as a\ncommunicative enterprise, greater recognition that punishment’s\njustification depends on the justification of the criminal law more\ngenerally, and growing interest in the normative challenges raised by\npunishment in the international context.\n\nThe central question asked by philosophers of punishment is: What can\njustify punishment? More precisely, since they do not usually talk\nmuch about punishment in such contexts as the family or the workplace\n(but see Zaibert 2006; Bennett 2008: Part II), their question is: What\ncan justify formal, legal punishment imposed by the state on those\nconvicted of committing criminal offences? We will also focus on legal\npunishment here: not because the other species of punishment do not\nraise important normative questions (they do), nor because such\nquestions can be answered in terms of an initial justification of\nlegal punishment as being the paradigm case (since it’s not\nclear that they can be), but because legal punishment, apart from\nbeing more dramatically coercive and burdensome than other species of\npunishment usually are, raises distinctive issues about the role of\nthe state and its relationship to its citizens, and about the role of\nthe criminal law. Future references to ‘punishment’ should\ntherefore be read, unless otherwise specified, as references to legal\nor criminal punishment.  \nWhat then are we to justify in justifying punishment? The search for a\nprecise definition of punishment that exercised some philosophers (for\ndiscussion and references, see Scheid 1980; Boonin 2008: 3–28;\nZimmerman 2011: ch. 1) is likely to prove futile: but we can say that\nlegal punishment involves the imposition of something that is intended\nto be both burdensome and reprobative, on a supposed offender for a\nsupposed crime, by a person or body who claims the authority to do so.\nTwo points are worth particular notice here. \nFirst, punishment involves material impositions or exactions that are\nin themselves typically unwelcome: they deprive people of things that\nthey value (liberty, money, time); they require people to do things\nthat they would not normally want to do or do voluntarily (to spend\ntime on unpaid community labour, to report to a probation officer\nregularly, to undertake demanding programmes of various kinds). What\ndistinguishes punishment from other kinds of coercive imposition, such\nas taxation, is that punishment is precisely intended to\n…: but to what? Some would say that punishment is intended to\ninflict pain or suffering: but that suggests that what matters is pain\nor suffering as such (and invites the familiar criticism that we and\nthe state should not be in the business of trying to inflict pain or\nsuffering on people; see Christie 1981 on\n‘pain-delivery’), which some penal theorists would reject\nas a distortion. Others would say that punishment is intended to cause\nharm to the offender — adding, if they are careful (see Hanna\n2014: s. 2) that what is intended is ‘prima facie harm’\nrather than ‘all-things-considered harm’, to allow for the\npossibility that punishment might be, or might be intended to be, on\nbalance beneficial to the offender. But some theorists would deny even\nthis, since they would deny that punishment must be intended to be\n‘intrinsically bad’ for the person punished. It is safer\nto say that punishment must be intended to be burdensome, and that is\nhow punishment will be understood in what follows. \nSecond, it is widely accepted that what distinguishes punishment from\nmere ‘penalties’ (see Feinberg 1970) is their reprobative\nor condemnatory character. Penalties, such as parking tickets, might\nbe imposed to deter the penalised conduct (or to recoup some of the\ncosts that it causes) without being intended to express societal\ncondemnation. But even if a primary purpose of punishment is\ndeterrence (see ss. 3–4 below), its imposition (the conviction\nand formal sentence that the offender receives in court, the\nadministration of the punishment itself) also expresses the censure or\ncondemnation that the offender’s crime is taken to warrant. \nThese two features, that punishment is intentionally burdensome and\ncondemnatory, make the practice especially normatively challenging.\nHow can a practice that not only burdens those subjected to it but\naims to burden them, and which convey’s society’s\ncondemnation, be justified? \nWe should not assume, however, that there is only one question of\njustification, which can receive just one answer. As Hart famously\npointed out (Hart 1968: 1–27), we must distinguish at least\nthree justificatory issues. First, what is the ‘general\njustifying aim’ of a system of punishment: what justifies the\ncreation and maintenance of such a system — what good can it\nachieve, what duty can it fulfil, what moral demand can it satisfy?\nSecond, who may properly be punished: what principles or aims should\ndetermine the allocations of punishments to individuals? Third, how\nshould the appropriate amount of punishment be determined: how should\nsentencers go about deciding what sentence to impose? (One dimension\nof this third question concerns the amount or severity of punishment;\nanother, which is insufficiently discussed by philosophers, concerns\nthe concrete modes of punishment that should be available, in general\nor for particular crimes.) It might of course turn out that answers to\nall these questions will flow from a single theoretical foundation\n— for instance, from a unitary consequentialist principle\nspecifying the good that punishment should achieve, or from some\nversion of the retributivist principle that the sole proper aim of\npunishment is to impose on the guilty the punitive burdens they\ndeserve. But matters might not be as simple as that: we might find\nthat quite different and conflicting values are relevant to different\nissues about punishment; and that any complete normative account of\npunishment will have to find a place for these values — and to\nhelp us find some no doubt uncomfortable compromises between them when\nthey conflict. \nEven this way of putting the matter oversimplifies it, by implying\nthat we can hope to find a ‘complete normative account of\npunishment’: an account, that is, of how punishment can be\njustified. It is certainly an implicit assumption of much\nphilosophical and legal discussion that punishment can, of course, be\njustified, and that the theorists’ task is to establish and\nexplicate that justification. But it is an illegitimate assumption:\nnormative theorists must be open to the possibility, startling and\ndisturbing as it might be, that this pervasive human practice cannot\nbe justified. Nor is this merely the kind of fantastical scepticism\nthat moral philosophers are sometimes prone to imagine (‘suppose\nsomeone denied that killing for pleasure was wrong’): there is a\nsignificant strand of ‘abolitionist’ penal theorising (to\nwhich insufficient attention is paid in the philosophical literature)\nthat argues precisely that legal punishment cannot be justified and\nshould be abolished. The abolitionist claim is not merely that our\nexisting penal practices are unjustified: viewed in the light of many\nnormative penal theories (one might almost say, of any plausible\nnormative penal theory) our existing penal practices, especially those\ninvolving imprisonment (given the actual nature of our prisons) or\nexecution, are not merely imperfect, but so radically inconsistent\nwith the values that should inform a practice of punishment that they\ncannot claim to be justified. For those who think that punishment can\nin principle be justified, this means simply (and hardly surprisingly)\nthat our penal practices need radical reform if they are to become\njustified: but the abolitionist critique goes much deeper than that,\nto argue that legal punishment cannot be justified even in\nprinciple. \nWe will attend to some abolitionist arguments in what follows. Even if\nthose arguments can be met, even if legal punishment can be justified,\nat least in principle, the abolitionist challenge is one that must be\nmet, rather than ignored; and it will help to remind us of the ways in\nwhich any practice of legal punishment is bound to be morally\nproblematic. \nLegal punishment presupposes crime as that for which punishment is\nimposed, and a criminal law as that which defines crimes as crimes; a\nsystem of criminal law presupposes a state, which has the political\nauthority to make and enforce the law and to impose punishments. A\nnormative account of legal punishment and its justification must thus\nat least presuppose, and should perhaps make explicit, a normative\naccount of the criminal law (why should we have a criminal law at\nall?) and of the proper powers and functions of the state (by what\nauthority or right does the state make and declare law, and impose\npunishments on those who break it?).  \nHow far it matters, in this context, to make explicit a political\ntheory of the state depends on how far different plausible political\ntheories will generate very different accounts of how punishment can\nbe justified and should be used. We cannot pursue this question here\n(for two sharply contrasting views on it, see Philips 1986, Davis\n1989; for more recent contributions showing the importance of\npolitical theory, see Pettit 1997; Matravers 2000; Dolovich 2004;\nGarvey 2004; Dagger 2007; Brettschneider 2007; Sigler 2011; Markel\n2012; Chiao 2016; Flanders 2017), save to note one central point. For\nany political theory (most obviously any version of liberalism or\nrepublicanism) that takes seriously the idea of citizenship as full\nmembership of the polity, the problem of punishment takes a\nparticularly acute form, since we have now to ask how punishment can\nbe consistent with citizenship (how citizens can legitimately punish\neach other): if we are not to say that those who commit crimes thereby\nforfeit their status as citizens (see s. 6 below), we must — if\nwe are to justify punishment at all — show how the imposition of\npunishment can be consistent with, or even expressive of, the respect\nthat citizens owe to each other. (Punishment is also, of course,\nimposed on non-citizens who commit crimes within a state’s\nterritory: on the primacy of citizenship in understanding criminal law\nand its authority, and on the status of non-citizens, see Duff\n2013.) \nBefore we tackle such theories of punishment, however, we should look\nbriefly at the concept of crime, since that is one focus of the\nabolitionist critique of punishment. \nOn a simple positivist view of law, crimes are kinds of conduct that\nare prohibited, on pain of threatened sanctions, by the law; and for\npositivists such as Bentham, who combine positivism with a normative\nconsequentialism, the questions of whether we should maintain a\ncriminal law at all, and of what kinds of conduct should be\ncriminalised, are to be answered by trying to determine whether and\nwhen this method of controlling human conduct is likely to produce a\nnet increase in good. Such a perspective seems inadequate, however:\ninadequate both to the claims of the criminal law, which presents its\ndemands as something other or more than those of a gunman writ large\n— as something other or more than ‘Behave thus, or\nelse!’ — and to the normative issues at stake when we ask\nwhat kinds of conduct should be criminalised. For the criminal law\nportrays crime not merely as conduct which has been prohibited, but as\na species of wrongdoing: whether our inquiry is analytical (into the\nconcept of crime) or normative (as to what kinds of conduct, if any,\nshould be criminal), we must therefore focus on that notion of\nwrongdoing. \nCrimes are, at least, socially proscribed wrongs — kinds of\nconduct that are condemned as wrong by some purportedly authoritative\nsocial norm. That is to say that they are wrongs which are not merely\n‘private’ affairs, which properly concern only those\ndirectly involved in them: the community as a whole — in this\ncase, the political community speaking through the law — claims\nthe right to declare them to be wrongs. But crimes are\n‘public’ wrongs in a sense that goes beyond this. Tort\nlaw, for instance, deals in part with wrongs that are non-private in\nthat they are legally and socially declared as wrongs — with the\nwrong constituted by libel, for instance. But they are still treated\nas ‘private’ wrongs in the sense that it is up to the\nperson who was wronged to seek legal redress. She must decide to\nbring, or not to bring, a civil case against the person who wronged\nher; and although she can appeal to the law to protect her rights, the\ncase is still between her and the defendant. By contrast, a criminal\ncase is between the whole political community — the state or the\npeople — and the defendant: the wrong is ‘public’ in\nthe sense that it is one for which the wrongdoer must answer not just\nto the individual victim, but to the whole polity through its criminal\ncourts. \nIt is notoriously difficult to give a clear and plausible account of\nthe distinction between civil and criminal law, between\n‘private’ and ‘public’ legal wrongs, whether\nour interest is in the analytical question of what the distinction\namounts to, or in the normative question of which kinds of wrong\nshould fall into which category (see Murphy and Coleman 1984, ch. 3; a\nsymposium in Boston University Law Review vol. 76 (1996):\n1–373; Lamond 2007). It might be tempting to say that crimes are\n‘public’ wrongs in the sense that they injure the whole\ncommunity: they threaten social order, for instance, or cause\n‘social volatility’ (Becker 1974); or they involve taking\nunfair advantage over those who obey the law (Murphy 1973, Dagger\n1993); or they undermine the trust on which social life depends\n(Dimock 1997). But such accounts distract our attention from the\nwrongs done to the individual victims that most crimes have, when it\nis those wrongs that should be our central concern: we should condemn\nthe rapist or murderer, we should see the wrong he has done as our\nconcern, because of what he has done to his victim. Another suggestion\nis that ‘public’ wrongs are those that flout the\ncommunity’s essential or most basic values, in which all members\nof the community should see themselves as sharing: the wrong is done\nto ‘us’, not merely to its individual victim, in the sense\nthat we identify ourselves with the victim as a fellow citizen (see\nMarshall and Duff 1998; Duff 2007, ch. 6; and see further section 6\n of the entry on \n  theories of criminal law). \nSome abolitionists, however, argue that we should seek to eliminate\nthe concept of crime from our social vocabulary: we should talk and\nthink not of ‘crimes’, but of ‘conflicts’ or\n‘troubles’ (Christie 1977; Hulsman 1986). One motivation\nfor this might be the thought that ‘crime’ entails\npunishment as the appropriate response: but that is not so, since we\ncould imagine a system of criminal law without punishment. To define\nsomething as a ‘crime’ does indeed imply that some kind of\npublic response is appropriate, since it is to define it as a kind of\nwrong that properly concerns the whole community; and it implies that\nthat response should be a condemnatory one, since to identify wrongs\nas wrongs is to mark them out as apt for condemnation: but that\npublic, condemnatory response could consist in nothing more than, for\ninstance, some version of a criminal trial which calls the alleged\nwrongdoer to answer for her alleged wrongdoing, and condemns her for\nit, through a criminal conviction, if she is proved guilty. One can of\ncourse count a criminal conviction as a kind of punishment: but it\ndoes not entail the kind of materially burdensome punishment, imposed\nafter conviction, with which penal theorists are primarily\nconcerned. \nAnother possible motivation for the abolitionist objection to the\nconcept of crime is a kind of moral relativism that objects to the\n‘imposition’ of values on those who might not share them\n(Bianchi 1994: 71–97): but since abolitionists are very ready to\ntell us, insistently, how we ought to respond to conflicts or\ntroubles, and how a state ought or ought not to treat its citizens,\nsuch an appeal to relativism reflects serious confusion (see Williams\n1976: 34–39). More plausibly, the abolitionist claim could be\nthat rather than take wrongdoing as our focus, we should focus on the\nharm that has been done, and on how it can be repaired; we will return\nto this suggestion in s.7 below. \nAnother abolitionist concern is that by defining and treating conduct\nas ‘criminal’, the law ‘steals’ the conflicts\nwhich crime involves from those to whom they properly belong (Christie\n1977): instead of allowing, and helping, those who find themselves in\nconflict to resolve their trouble, the law takes the matter over and\ntranslates it into the professionalised context of the criminal\njustice system, in which neither ‘victim’ nor\n‘offender’ is allowed any appropriate or productive role.\nNow it is a familiar and disturbing truth that our existing criminal\nprocesses — both in their structure and in their actual\noperations — tend to preclude any effective participation by\neither victims or offenders, although an adequate response to the\ncriminal wrong that was done should surely involve them both. One\nresponse is to argue, as some abolitionists do, that our response to\ncrime should consist not in punishment, but in a process of mediation\nor ‘restoration’ between victim and offender (see further\ns. 7 below); but another is to insist that we should retain a\ndistinctive criminal process of trials, and punishment, in which the\npolity as a whole, acting on behalf of the victim as well as on its\nown behalf, calls the criminal wrongdoer to account — but that\nvictims and offenders should be given a more active role in that\nprocess (see further Duff et al 2007, esp. chs. 3–5, 7). Such an\ninsistence on the need for a public criminal process reflects two\naspects of the concept of crime: first, it is sometimes important to\nrecognise that a situation involves not just people in\n‘conflict’, but a victim who has been wronged and an\noffender who has done the wrong; second, some such wrongs are\n‘public’ wrongs in the sense sketched above — wrongs\nthat properly concern not just those directly affected, but all\nmembers of the political community. Faced, for instance, by feuding\nneighbours who persistently accuse each other of more or less trivial\nwrongs, it might indeed be appropriate to suggest that they should\nforget about condemning each other and look for a way of resolving\ntheir conflict. But faced by a rapist and the person he raped, or by a\nviolent husband and the wife he has been beating up, it would a\nbetrayal both of the victim and of the values to which we are\nsupposedly committed to portray the situation merely as a\n‘conflict’ which the parties should seek to resolve:\nwhatever else or more we can do, we must recognise and declare that\nhere is a victim who has been seriously wronged; and we must be\ncollectively ready to censure the offender’s action as a wrong\n(for a useful discussion of the significance of criminal law in the\ncontext of domestic violence, see Dempsey 2009). \nHowever, to argue that we should retain the concept of crime, that we\nshould maintain a criminal law which defines and condemns a category\nof ‘public’ wrongs, is not yet to say that we should\nmaintain a penal system that punishes those who commit such wrongs;\nwhile a system of criminal law might require something like a system\nof criminal trials that will authoritatively identify and condemn\ncriminal wrongdoers, it does not of its nature require the imposition\nof further sanctions on such wrongdoers. So we must turn now to the\nquestion of what could justify such a system of punishment. \nMany people, including those who do not take a consequentialist view\nof other matters, think that any adequate justification of punishment\nmust be basically consequentialist. For we have here a practice that\ninflicts, indeed seeks to inflict, significant hardship or burdens:\nhow else could we hope to justify it than by showing that it brings\nconsequential benefits sufficiently large to outweigh, and thus to\njustify, those burdens? We need not be Benthamite utilitarians to be\nmoved by Bentham’s famous remark that “all punishment in\nitself is evil. ... [I]f it ought at all to be admitted, it ought only\nto be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater\nevil” (Bentham 1789: ch. XIII.2). However, when we try to flesh\nout that simple consequentialist thought into something closer to a\nfull normative account of punishment, problems begin to appear. \nA consequentialist must justify punishment (if she is to justify it at\nall) as a cost-effective means to certain independently identifiable\ngoods (for two simple examples of such theories, see Wilson 1983;\nWalker 1991). Whatever account she gives of the final good or goods at\nwhich all action ultimately aims, the most plausible immediate good\nthat a system of punishment can bring is the reduction of crime. A\nrational consequentialist system of law will define as criminal only\nconduct that is in some way harmful; in reducing crime we will thus be\nreducing the harms that crime causes. It is commonly suggested that\npunishment can help to reduce crime by deterring, incapacitatiing, or\nreforming potential offenders (though for an argument that\nincapacitation is not a genuinely punitive aim, see Hoskins 2016:\n260). (There are of course other goods that a system of punishment can\nbring. It can reassure those who fear crime that the state is taking\nsteps to protect them—though this is a good that, in a\nwell-informed society, will be achieved only insofar as the more\nimmediate preventive goods are achieved. It can also bring\nsatisfaction to those who want to see wrongdoers suffer — though\nto show that to be a genuine good, rather than merely a means of\naverting vigilantism and private revenge, we would need to show that\nit involves something more than mere vengeance, which would be to make\nsense of some version of retributivism.) \nIt is a contingent question whether punishment can be an efficient\nmethod of reducing crime in any of these ways, and some objections to\npunishment rest on the empirical claim that it cannot be — that\nthere are other and more efficient methods of crime reduction (see\nWootton 1963; Menninger 1968; Boonin 2008: 53, 264-67). Our focus\nhere, however, will be on the moral objections to consequentialist\naccounts of punishment — objections, basically, that\ncrime-reductive efficiency does not suffice to justify a system of\npunishment. \nThe most familiar line of objection to consequentialist penal theories\ncontends that consequentialists would be committed to regarding\nmanifestly unjust punishments (the punishment of those known to be\ninnocent, for instance, or excessively harsh punishment of the guilty)\nto be in principle justified if they would efficiently serve the aim\nof crime reduction: but such punishments would be wrong, because they\nwould be unjust (see e.g., McCloskey 1957: 468-69; Hart 1968, chs.\n1–2; Ten 1987; Primoratz 1999, chs. 2–3; Boonin 2008: ch.\n2). \nThere are some equally familiar consequentialist responses to this\nfamiliar objection. One is to argue that such\n‘unjust’punishments would be justified if they\nwould really produce the best consequences (see e.g., Smart 1973:\n69–72; Bagaric and Amarasekara 2000) — to which the critic\nwill reply that we cannot thus put aside the moral significance of\ninjustice. Another is to argue that in the real world it is extremely\nunlikely that such punishments would ever be for the best, and even\nless likely that the agents involved could be trusted reliably to pick\nout those rare cases in which they would be: thus we, and especially\nour penal officials, will do best if we think and act as if such\npunishments are intrinsically wrong and unjustifiable (see e.g., Rawls\n1955; Hare 1981, chs. 3, 9.7) — to which the critic will respond\nthat this still makes the wrongness of punishing a known innocent\ncontingent on its effects, and fails to recognise the intrinsic wrong\nthat such punishment does (see e.g., Duff 1986: 151–64;\nPrimoratz 1999, chs. 3.3, 6.5). Another response is to argue that a\nricher or subtler account of the ends that the criminal law should\nserve will generate suitable protection against unjust punishments\n(see Braithwaite and Pettit 1990, especially 71–76, on\n‘dominion’ as the end of criminal law); but the objection\nremains that any purely consequentialist account will make the\nprotection of the innocent against injustice contingent on its\ninstrumental contribution to the system’s aims (on Braithwaite\nand Pettit, see von Hirsch and Ashworth 1992; Duff 1996: 20–25;\nPettit 1997). \nWhereas consequentialist accounts regard punishment as justified\ninstrumentally, as a means to achieving some valuable goal (typically\ncrime reduction), retributivist accounts contend that punishment is\njustified as an intrinsically appropriate, because deserved, response\nto wrongdoing (but see Berman 2011 for an argument that some recent\nversions of retributivism actually turn it into a consequentialist\ntheory). \nTheorists have distinguished ‘positive’ and\n‘negative’ forms of retributivism. Positive retributivism\nholds that an offender’s desert provides a reason in favor of\npunishment; essentially, the state should punish those found guilty of\ncriminal offences to the extent that they deserve, because they\ndeserve it. Penal desert constitutes not just a necessary, but an\nin-principle sufficient reason for punishment (only in principle,\nhowever, since there are very good reasons — to do with the\ncosts, both material and moral, of punishment — why we should\nnot even try to punish all the guilty). Negative retributivism, by\ncontrast, provides not a positive reason to punish, but rather a\nconstraint on punishment: punishment should be imposed only on those\nwho deserve it, and only in proportion with their desert. Because\nnegative retributivism represents only a constraining principle, not a\npositive reason to punish, it has been employed in various mixed\naccounts of punishment, which endorse punishment for consequentialist\nreasons but only insofar as the punishment is no more than is deserved\n(see s. 6 below). \nA striking feature of penal theorising during the last three decades\nof the twentieth century was a revival of positive retributivism\n— of the idea that the positive justification of punishment is\nto be found in its intrinsic character as a deserved response to crime\n(see H. Morris 1968; N. Morris 1974; Murphy 1973; von Hirsch 1976; two\nuseful collections of contemporary papers on retributivism are White\n2011 and Tonry 2012). \nPositive retributivism comes in very different forms (Cottingham\n1979). All can be understood, however, as attempting to answer the two\ncentral questions faced by any retributivist theory of punishment.\nFirst, what is the justificatory relationship between crime and\npunishment that the idea of desert is supposed to capture: why do the\nguilty ‘deserve to suffer’ (see L. Davis 1972) — and\nwhat do they deserve to suffer (see Ardal 1984; Honderich 2005, ch.\n2)? Second, even if they deserve to suffer, or to be burdened in some\ndistinctive way, why should it be for the state to inflict that\nsuffering or that burden on them through a system of criminal\npunishment (Murphy 1985; Husak 1992; Shafer-Landau 1996; Wellman\n2009)? \nOne retributivist answer to these questions is that crime involves\ntaking an unfair advantage over the law-abiding, and that punishment\nremoves that unfair advantage. The criminal law benefits all citizens\nby protecting them from certain kinds of harm: but this benefit\ndepends upon citizens accepting the burden of self-restraint involved\nin obeying the law. The criminal takes the benefit of the\nself-restraint of others, but refuses to accept that burden herself:\nshe has gained an unfair advantage, which punishment removes by\nimposing some additional burden on her (see H. Morris 1968; Murphy\n1973; Sadurski 1985; Sher 1987, ch. 5; Adler 1992, chs. 5–8;\nDagger 1993, 2008, 2011; Stichter 2010; for criticism, see Burgh 1982;\nDuff 1986, ch. 8; Falls 1987; Dolinko 1991; Anderson 1997; Boonin\n2008: 119–143; Hoskins 2011b). \nThis kind of account does indeed answer the two questions noted above.\nWhat the criminal deserves to suffer is the loss of her unfair\nadvantage, and she deserves that because it is unfair that she should\nget away with taking the benefits of the law without accepting the\nburdens on which those benefits depend; it is the state’s job to\ninflict this suffering on her, because it is the author or guarantor\nof the criminal law. However, such accounts have internal\ndifficulties: for instance, how are we to determine how great was the\nunfair advantage gained by a crime; how far are such measurements of\nunfair advantage likely to correlate with our judgements of the\nseriousness of crimes? (For a detailed defence of the ‘unfair\nadvantage’ theory as a theory of sentencing, see M. Davis 1992,\n1996; for criticism, see Scheid 1990, 1995; von Hirsch 1990.)\nFurthermore, they seem to misrepresent what it is about crime that\nmakes it deserving of punishment: what makes murder, or rape, or\ntheft, or assault a criminal wrong, deserving of punishment, is surely\nthe wrongful harm that it does to the individual victim — not\n(as on this kind of account) the supposed unfair advantage that the\ncriminal takes over all those who obey the law (for recent attempts to\ndefend fair play retributivism against these objections, see Stichter\n2010 and Duus-Otterström forthcoming). \nA different retributivist account appeals not to the abstract notion\nof unfair advantage, but to our (normal, appropriate) emotional\nresponses to crime: for instance, to the resentment or\n‘retributive hatred’, involving a desire to make the\nwrongdoer suffer, that crime may arouse (see Murphy and Hampton 1988,\nchs. 1, 3); or to the guilt, involving the judgement that I ought to\nbe punished, that my own wrongdoing would arouse in me (see Moore\n1997, ch. 4). Such accounts try to answer the first of the two\nquestions noted above: crime deserves punishment in the sense that it\nmakes appropriate certain emotions (resentment, guilt) which are\nsatisfied by or expressed in punishment. They do not yet show,\nhowever, why it should be the state’s task to satisfy or provide\nformal expression for such emotions (but see Stephen 1873: 152); and\ntheir answers to the first question are also problematic. Criminal\nwrongdoing should, we can agree, provoke certain kinds of emotion,\nsuch as self-directed guilt and other-directed indignation; and such\nemotions might typically involve a desire to make those at whom they\nare directed suffer. But just as we can agree that anger is an\nappropriate response to wrongs done to me, while also arguing that we\nshould resist the desire to hit back that anger often, even typically,\ninvolves (see Horder 1992:194–7), so we could argue that\nalthough guilt, resentment and indignation are appropriate responses\nto our own and others’ wrongdoing, we should resist the desire\nfor suffering that they so often involve. At the least we need to know\nmore than we are told by these accounts about just what wrongdoers\ndeserve to suffer, and why the infliction of suffering should be an\nappropriate way to express such proper emotions. (For critical\ndiscussions of Murphy, see Murphy and Hampton 1988, ch. 2; Duff 1996:\n29–31; Murphy 1999. On Moore, see Dolinko 1991: 555–9;\nKnowles 1993; Murphy 1999. See also Murphy 2003, 2012.) \nA third version of retributivism holds that when people commit a\ncrime, they thereby incur a moral debt to their victims, and\npunishment is deserved as a way to pay this debt (McDermott 2001).\nThis moral debt differs from the material debt that an offender may\nincur, and thus payment of the material debt (returning stolen money\nor property, etc.) does not settle the moral debt: punishment is\nneeded to pay the moral debt, by denying the ill-gotten moral good to\nthe perpetrator. Among the challenges for this account are to explain\nthe nature of the moral good, how the offender takes this moral good\nfrom the victim, how punishment denies this good to the offender, and\nhow doing so thereby pays the offender’s debt to the victim. \nPerhaps the most influential version of retributivism in recent\ndecades seeks the meaning and justification of punishment as a\ndeserved response to crime in its expressive or communicative\ncharacter. (On the expressed dimension of punishment, see generally\nFeinberg 1970, Primoratz 1989; for critical discussion, see Hart 1963:\n60–69; Skillen 1980; M. Davis 1996; 169–81.)\nConsequentialists can of course portray punishment as useful partly in\nvirtue of its expressive character (see Lacey 1988; Braithwaite and\nPettit 1990); but a portrayal of punishment as a mode of deserved\nmoral communication has been central to many recent versions of\nretributivism.  \nThe central meaning and purpose of punishment, on such accounts, is to\ncommunicate to offenders the censure or condemnation that they deserve\nfor their crimes. Once we recognise, as we should, that punishment can\nserve this communicative purpose, we can see how such accounts begin\nto answer the two questions that retributivists face. First, there is\nan obviously intelligible justificatory relationship between\nwrongdoing and censure — as a response which is intended to\nimpose a burden (the burden of condemnation by one’s fellows) on\nan offender for his offence: whatever puzzles there might be about\nother attempts to explain the idea of penal desert, the idea that\nwrongdoers deserve to suffer censure is surely unpuzzling. Second, it\nis appropriate for the state to ensure that such censure is formally\nadministered through the criminal justice system: if crimes are public\nwrongs, breaches of the political community’s authoritative\ncode, then they merit public censure by the community. Furthermore,\nalthough internal to censure is the intention, or hope, that the\nperson censured will accept the censure as justified and will thus be\nmotivated to avoid crime in future, this kind of account can avoid the\ncharge (as brought against consequentialist theories) that it seeks to\ncoerce or manipulate offenders into obeying the law. For censure\naddresses, and respects, the person censured as a rational and\nresponsible agent: it constitutes an appropriate, deserved response to\nthe wrong that she did, and seeks to bring her to modify her future\nconduct only by reminding her of the good moral reasons that she has\nfor refraining from crime; it is an appropriate way for citizens to\ntreat and respond to each other. (For different kinds of communicative\naccount, see especially von Hirsch 1993, ch.2; Duff 2001, chs. 1.4.4,\n3.2; Bennett 2008; Markel 2011, 2012. For critical discussion, see\nDavis 1991; Boonin 2008: 171–80; Hanna 2008; Matravers 2011).\n \nHowever, an obvious and crucial question faces any such justification\nof punishment as a communicative enterprise. Censure can be\ncommunicated through a formal conviction in a criminal court; or it\ncould be communicated by some further formal denunciation issued by a\njudge or some other representative of the legal community, or by a\nsystem of purely symbolic punishments which were burdensome only in\nvirtue of their censorial meaning. It can, of course, also be\ncommunicated by ‘hard treatment’ punishments of the kinds\nimposed by our courts — by imprisonment, by compulsory community\nservice, by fines and the like, which are burdensome independently of\ntheir censorial meaning (on ‘hard treatment’, see Feinberg\n1970): but why should we choose such methods of communication, rather\nthan methods that do not involve hard treatment (see Christie 1981:\n98–105)? Is it because they will make the communication more\neffective (see Falls 1987; Primoratz 1989; Kleinig 1991)? But why is\nit so important to make the communication effective — and is\nthere not a serious danger that the hard treatment will conceal,\nrather than highlight, the moral censure it should communicate (see\nMathiesen 1990: 58–73)? \nOne sort of answer to this question explains penal hard treatment as\nan essential aspect of the enterprise of moral communication itself.\nPunishment, on this view, should aim not merely to communicate censure\nto the offender, but to persuade the offender to recognise and repent\nthe wrong he has done, and so to recognise the need to reform himself\nand his future conduct, and to make apologetic reparation to those\nwhom he wronged. His punishment then constitutes a kind of secular\npenance that he is required to undergo for his crime: its hard\ntreatment aspects, the burden it imposes on him, should serve both to\nassist the process of repentance and reform, by focusing his attention\non his crime and its implications, and as a way of making the\napologetic reparation that he owes (see Duff 2001, 2011; see also\nGarvey 1999, 2003; Tudor 2001; Bennett 2008; for a sophisticated\ndiscussion see Tasioulas 2006). This type of account faces serious\nobjections (see Bickenbach 1988; Ten 1990; von Hirsch 1999; Bagaric\nand Amarasekara 2000; von Hirsch and Ashworth 2005, ch. 7): in\nparticular that it cannot show penal hard treatment to be a necessary\naspect of a communicative enterprise which is still to respect\noffenders as responsible and rational agents who must be left free to\nremain unpersuaded; that apologetic reparation must be voluntary if it\nis to be of any real value; and that a liberal state should not take\nthis kind of intrusive interest in its citizens’ moral\ncharacters. \nGiven the challenges faced by pure consequentialist and pure\nretributivist accounts, some theorists have sought to make progress on\nthe question of punishment’s justification by incorporating\nconsequentialist and nonconsequentialist elements into their accounts.\nPerhaps the most influential example of a mixed account begins by\nrecognizing that the question of punishment’s justification is\nin fact several different questions, which may be answered by appeal\nto different considerations: we can argue, first, that the\n‘general justifying aim’ (Hart 1968: 8–11) of a\nsystem of punishment must lie in its beneficial effects, but second,\nthat our pursuit of that aim must be constrained by\nnonconsequentialist principles that preclude the kinds of injustice\nalleged to flow from a purely consequentualist account. A simple\nversion of this approach identifies certain side-constraints to which\nour pursuit of the consequential benefits of punishment must be\nsubject: constraints that forbid, for instance, the deliberate\npunishment of the innocent, or the excessively harsh punishment of the\nguilty. (See most famously Hart 1968, and Scheid 1997 for a\nsophisticated Hartian theory; on Hart, see Lacey 1988: 46–56;\nMorison 1988; Primoratz 1999, ch. 6.6.) Critics have charged that this\nstrategy is ad hoc or internally inconsistent (see Kaufman 2008:\n45-49). In addition, retributivists argue that it relegates\nretributivism to a merely subsidiary role, as a basis for\nside-constraints, when in fact giving offenders their just deserts is\na (or the) central rationale for punishment (see Wood 2002: 303). \nAnother key worry about such accounts concerns the grounding of these\nside-constraints. If they are derived from a ‘negative’\nretributivism that insists that punishment is justified only if it is\ndeserved (see Dolinko 1991: 539–43), then they face the thorny\nproblem of explaining this retributivist notion of desert (see s. 4\nabove): but it is not clear whether they can be justified without such\nan appeal to retributivist desert (see Hart 1968: 44–48;\nFeinberg 1988: 144–55; Walker 1991, ch. 11). Even if such\nside-constraints can be securely grounded, however, consequentialist\ntheories of punishment face further, broadly Kantian objections,\nfocused on the moral character of punishment within those constraints.\nOn such accounts, so long as punishment is deserved it may and should\nbe used to serve consequentialist ends — most obviously the end\nof crime reduction. But, the critic now objects, to use punishment\nthus is to use those who are punished ‘merely as means’ to\nthose further ends, which is to deny them the respect, the moral\nstanding, that is their due as responsible agents (see Murphy 1973:\n218).  \nThe Kantian prohibition on treating each other ‘merely as\nmeans’ is admittedly unclear in its implications (for a useful\ndiscussion of how we should understand ‘the means\nprinciple’, see Tadros 2011: ch. 6). It can be argued that if\npunishment is reserved for those who voluntarily break the law, it\ndoes not treat them merely as means (see Walker 1980:\n80–85; Hoskins 2011a). Indeed, Kant himself suggested that as\nlong as we reserve punishment only for those found guilty of crimes,\nthen it is permissible to punish with an eye toward potential benefits\n(Kant 1797: 473). Still, a critic may argue that if we are to treat\nanother ‘as an end’, with the respect due to her as a\nrational and responsible agent, we must seek to modify her conduct\nonly by offering her good and relevant reasons to modify it for\nherself. Punishment aimed at deterrence, incapacitation, or offender\nreform, however, does not satisfy that demand. A reformative system\ntreats those subjected to it not as rational, self-determining agents,\nbut as objects to be re-formed by whatever efficient (and humane)\ntechniques we can find. An incapacitative system does not leave those\nsubjected to it free, as responsible agents should be left free, to\ndetermine their own future conduct, but seeks to preempt their future\nchoices by incapacitating them. And although a deterrent system does,\nunlike the others, offer potential offenders reason to obey the law,\nit offers them the wrong kind of reason: instead of addressing them as\nresponsible moral agents, in terms of the moral reasons which justify\nthe law’s demands on them, it addresses them as merely\nself-interested beings, in the coercive language of threat; deterrence\ntreats ‘a man like a dog instead of with the freedom and respect\ndue to him as a man’ (Hegel 1821: 246. For these objections, see\nLewis 1953; H Morris 1968; Duff 1986: 178–86; von Hirsch 1993:\n9–14; von Hirsch and Ashworth 1998, chs. 1, 3). \nOne strategy for dealing with them is to posit a two-step\njustification of punishment. The first step, which typically appeals\nto nonconsequentialist values, shows how the commission of a crime\nrenders the offender eligible for, or liable to, the kinds of coercive\ntreatment that punishment involves: such treatment, which is normally\ninconsistent with the respect due to us as rational agents or as\ncitizens, and inconsistent with the Kantian means principle, is\nrendered permissible by the commission of the offence. The second step\nis then to offer positive consequentialist reasons for imposing\npunishment on those who are eligible for it or liable to it: we should\npunish if and because this can be expected to produce sufficient\nconsequential benefits to outweigh its undoubted costs. (Further\nnonconsequentialist constraints might also be placed on the severity\nand modes of punishment that can be permitted: constraints either\nflowing from an account of just what offenders render themselves\nliable to, or from other values external to the system of punishment.)\n \nThus, for instance, some argue that those who voluntarily break the\nlaw thereby forfeit at least some of the rights that citizens can\nnormally claim: their wrongdoing therefore legitimises kinds of\ntreatment (reformative or incapacitative treatment, for instance, or\ndeterrent punishment) that would normally be wrong as violating\ncitizens’ rights (see Goldman 1982; C Morris 1991; Wellman 2012;\nfor criticisms, see Lippke 2001a; Boonin 2008: 103–19). We must\nask, however, whether we should be so quick to exclude fellow citizens\nfrom the rights and status of citizenship, or whether we should not\nlook for an account of punishment (if it is to be justified at all) on\nwhich punishment can still be claimed to treat those punished as full\ncitizens. (The common practice of denying imprisoned offenders the\nright to vote while they are in prison, and perhaps even after they\nleave prison, is symbolically significant in this context: those who\nwould argue that punishment should be consistent with recognised\ncitizenship should also oppose such practices; see Lippke 2001b;\nJournal of Applied Philosophy 2005.) \nAnother view holds that punishment does not violate offenders’\nrights insofar as they consent to their punishment (see Nino 1983).\nThe consent view holds that when a person voluntarily commits a crime\nwhile knowing the consequences of doing so, she thereby consents to\nthese consequences. This is not to say that she explicitly\nconsents to being punished, but rather than by her voluntary action\nshe tacitly consents to be subject to what she knows are the\nconsequences. Notice that, like the forfeiture view, the consent view\nis agnostic regarding the positive aim of punishment: it purports to\ntell us only that punishing the person does not wrong her, as she has\neffectively waived her right against such treatment. The consent view\nfaces formidable objections, however. First, it appears unable to\nground prohibitions on excessively harsh sentences: if such sentences\nare implemented, then anyone who subsequently violates the\ncorresponding laws will have apparently tacitly consented to the\npunishment (Alexander 1986). A second objection is that most offenders\ndo not in fact consent, even tacitly, to their sentences, because they\nare unaware either that their acts are subject to punishment or of the\nseverity of the punishment to which they may be liable. For someone to\nhave consented to be subject to certain consequences of an act, she\nmust know of these consequences (see Boonin 2008: 161–64). A\nthird objection is that, because tacit consent can be overridden by\nexplicit denial of consent, it appears that explicitly nonconsenting\noffenders could not be justifiably punished on this view (ibid.:\n164–165; but see Imbrisevic 2010).  \nOthers offer contractualist or contractarian justifications of\npunishment, grounded in an account not of what treatment offenders\nhave in fact tacitly consented to, but rather of what rational agents\nor reasonable citizens would endorse. The punishment of those who\ncommit crimes is then, it is argued, rendered permissible by the fact\nthat the offender himself would, as a rational agent or reasonable\ncitizen, have consented to a system of law that provided for such\npunishments (see e.g., Dolovich 2004; Brettschneider 2007; Finkelstein\n2011; for criticism, see Dagger 2011; see also Matravers 2000). Still\nothers portray punishment (in particular deterrent punishment) as a\nspecies of societal (self-) defence — and it seems clear that to\ndefend oneself against a wrongful attack is not to use the attacker\n‘merely as a means’, or to fail to show him the respect\nthat is his due.(For versions of this kind of argument, see Alexander\n1980; Quinn 1985; Farrell 1985, 1995; Montague 1995; Ellis 2003 and\n2012. For criticism, see Boonin 2008: 192–207. For a\nparticularly intricate development of this line of thought, grounding\nthe justification of punishment in the duties that we incur by\ncommitting wrongs, see Tadros 2011; for critical responses, see the\nspecial issue of Law and Philosophy, 2013.)  \nOne might argue that the Hegelian objection to a system of deterrent\npunishment overstates the tension between the types of reasons, moral\nor prudential, that such a system may offer. Punishment may\ncommunicate both a prudential and a moral message to members of the\ncommunity. Even before a crime is committed, the threat of punishment\ncommunicates societal condemnation of an offense. This moral message\nmay help to dissuade potential offenders, but those who are\nunpersuaded by this moral message may still be prudentially deterred\nby the prospect of punishment. Similarly, those who actually do commit\ncrimes may be dissuaded from reoffending by the moral censure conveyed\nby their punishment, or else by the prudential desire to avoid another\nround of hard treatment. What’s more, even if punishment itself\ndid provide solely prudential reasons not to commit crimes, the\ncriminal legal system more generally may communicate with citizens in\nmoral terms. Through its criminal statutes, a community declares\ncertain acts to be wrong and makes a moral appeal to community members\nto comply, whereas trials and convictions can communicate a message of\ndeserved censure to the offender. Thus even if a system of deterrent\npunishment is itself regarded as communicating solely in prudential\nterms, it seems that the criminal law more generally can still\ncommunicate a moral message to those subject to it (see Hoskins\n2011a). \nA somewhat different attempt to accommodate prudential as well as\nmoral reasons in an account of punishment begins with the\nretributivist notion that punishment is justified as a form of\ndeserved censure, but then contends that we should communicate censure\nthrough penal hard treatment because this will give those who are\ninsufficiently impressed by the moral appeal of censure prudential\nreason to refrain from crime; because, that is, the prospect of such\npunishment might deter those who are not susceptible to moral\npersuasion. (See Lipkin 1988, Baker 1992. For a sophisticated revision\nof this idea, which makes deterrence firmly secondary to censure, see\nvon Hirsch 1993, ch. 2; Narayan 1993. For critical discussion, see\nBottoms 1998; Duff 2001, ch. 3.3. For another subtle version of this\nkind of account, see Matravers 2000.) This kind of account differs\nfrom the accounts just discussed, on which retributivist prohibitions\non punishment of the innocent or excessive punishment of the guilty\nconstrain the pursuit of consequentialist aims, since in the current\naccount the (retributivist) imposition of deserved censure is part of\nthe positive justifying aim of punishment; and it can claim, in\nresponse to the Hegelian objection to deterrence, that it does not\naddress potential offenders merely ‘like dogs’, since the\nlaw’s initial appeal to the citizen is in the appropriate moral\nterms: the prudential, coercive reasons constituted by penal hard\ntreatment as deterrence are relevant only to those who are deaf, or at\nleast insufficiently attentive, to the law’s moral appeal. It\nmight be objected that on this account the law, in speaking to those\nwho are not persuaded by its moral appeal, is still abandoning the\nattempt at moral communication in favour of the language of threats,\nand thus ceasing to address its citizens as responsible moral agents:\nto which it might be replied, first, that the law is addressing us,\nappropriately, as fallible moral agents who know that we need the\nadditional spur of prudential deterrence to persuade us to act as we\nshould; and second, that we cannot clearly separate the (merely)\ndeterrent from the morally communicative dimensions of punishment\n— that the dissuasive efficacy of legitimate punishment still\ndepends crucially on the moral meaning that the hard treatment is\nunderstood to convey. \nOne more mixed view worth noting holds that punishment is justified as\na means of teaching a moral lesson to those who commit crimes, and\nperhaps to community members more generally (the seminal articulations\nof this view are H. Morris 1981 and Hampton 1984; for a more recent\naccount, see Demetriou 2012; for criticism, see Deigh 1984,\nShafer-Landau 1991). Like standard consequentialist accounts, the\nmoral education view acknowledges that punishment’s role in\nreducing crime is a central part of its rationale (see, e.g., Hampton\n1984: 211). But education theorists also take seriously the Hegelian\nworry discussed earlier; they view punishment not as a means of\nconditioning people to behave in certain ways, but rather as a means\nof teaching them that what they have done should not be done because\nit is morally wrong. Thus although the education view sets offender\nreform as an end, it also implies certain nonconsequentialist\nconstraints on how we may appropriately pursue this end. Another\ndistinctive feature of the moral education view is that it conceives\nof punishment as aiming to confer a benefit on the offender: the\nbenefit of moral education. Critics have objected to the moral\neducation view on various grounds, however. Some are sceptical about\nwhether punishment is the most effective means of moral education.\nOthers deny that most offenders are in need of moral education; many\noffenders realise what they are doing is wrong but are weak-willed,\nimpulsive, etc. Also, may liberal theorists object that the education\nview is inappropriately paternalistic in that it endorses coercively\nrestricting offenders’ liberties as a means to confer a benefit\non them. \nEach of the theories discussed in this section incorporates, in\nvarious ways, consequentialist and nonconsequentialist elements.\nWhether any of these is more plausible than pure consequentialist or\npure retributivist alternatives is, not surprisingly, a matter of\nongoing philosophical debate. One possibility, of course, is that none\nof the theories on offer is successful because punishment is,\nultimately, unjustifiable. A question for those who endorse such a\nview is what alternative response to criminal offending we should\nendorse. The next section considers two candidate answers. \nAbolitionist theorising about punishment takes many different forms,\nunited only by the insistence that we should seek to abolish, rather\nthan merely to reform, our practices of punishment. (Classic\nabolitionist texts include Christie 1977, 1981; Hulsman 1986, 1991; de\nHaan 1990; Bianchi 1994; Golash 2005; and Boonin 2008.) In this\nsection we will attend to just two types of abolitionist theory. \nMany abolitionists look to ‘restorative justice’ as an\nalternative to punishment. (‘Restorative’ practices and\nprogrammes also play an increasingly significant, although still\nsomewhat marginal, role within the criminal process of trial\nand punishment; but our concern here is with restorative justice as an\nalternative to punishment.) The restorative justice movement\nhas been growing in strength: although there are different and\nconflicting conceptions of what ‘restorative justice’\nmeans or involves, one central theme is that what crime makes\nnecessary is a process of reparation or restoration between offender,\nvictim, and other interested parties; and that this is achieved not\nthrough a criminal process of trial and punishment, but through\nmediation or reconciliation programmes that bring together the victim,\noffender and other interested parties to discuss what was done and how\nto deal with it (see generally Matthews 1988; Daly and Immarigeon\n1998; von Hirsch and Ashworth 1998, ch. 7; Braithwaite 1999; Walgrave\n2002; von Hirsch et al 2003; von Hirsch, Ashworth and Shearing 2005;\nLondon 2011; Johnstone 2011, 2012).  \nAdvocates of restorative justice often contrast it with\n‘retributive’ justice, and argue that we should look for\nrestoration rather than retribution or punishment, and seek to repair\nharms caused rather than to inflict punitive suffering for wrongs\ndone. But it could be argued that this is a mistake. For when we ask\nwhat it is that requires ‘restoration’ or repair, the\nanswer must refer not only to whatever material harm was caused by the\ncrime, but to the wrong that was done: that was what fractured the\nrelationship between offender and victim (and the broader community),\nand that is what must be recognised and ‘repaired’ or made\nup for if a genuine reconciliation is to be achieved. A restorative\nprocess that is to be appropriate to crime must therefore be one that\nseeks an adequate recognition, by the offender and by others, of the\nwrong done—a recognition that must for the offender, if genuine,\nbe repentant; and that seeks an appropriate apologetic reparation for\nthat wrong from the offender. But those are also the aims of\npunishment as a species of secular penance, as sketched above. A\nsystem of criminal punishment, however improved it might be (see s. 8\nbelow), is of course not well designed to bring about the kind of\npersonal reconciliations and transformations that advocates of\nrestorative justice sometimes seek; but it could be apt to secure the\nkind of formal, ritualised reconciliation that is the most that a\nliberal state should try to secure between its citizens. If we focus\nonly on imprisonment, which is still often the preferred mode of\npunishment in many penal systems, this suggestion will appear\nlaughable; but if we think instead of punishments such as Community\nService Orders (now part of what is called Community Payback) or\nprobation, it might seem more plausible. \nThis argument does not, of course, support that account of punishment\nagainst its critics. What it might suggest, however, is that although\nwe can learn much from the restorative justice movement, especially\nabout the role that processes of mediation and reparation can play in\nour responses to crime, its aim should not be the abolition or\nreplacement of punishment: ‘restoration’ is better\nunderstood, in this context, as the proper aim of punishment, not as\nan alternative to it (see further Duff 2001, ch. 3.4–6, but also\nZedner 1994). \nA similar issue is raised by the other kind of abolitionist theory\nthat we should note here: the argument that we should replace\npunishment by a system of enforced restitution (see e.g., Barnett\n1977; Boonin 2008: ch. 5 — which also cites and discusses a\nnumber of objections to the theory). For we need to ask what\nrestitution can amount to, what it should involve, if it is to\nconstitute restitution not merely for any harm that might have been\ncaused, but for the wrong that was done; and it is tempting to answer\nthat restitution for a wrong must involve the kind of apologetic moral\nreparation, expressing a remorseful recognition of the wrong, that\ncommunicative punishment (on the view sketched above) aims to\nbecome. \nMore generally, advocates of restorative justice and of restitution\nare right to highlight the question of what offenders owe to those\nwhom they have wronged — and to their fellow citizens (see also\nTadros 2011 for a focus on the duties that offenders incur). Some\npenal theorists, however, especially those who connect punishment to\napology, will reply that what offenders owe precisely includes\naccepting, undertaking, or undergoing punishment. \nThe previous sections sketched the central contemporary accounts of\nwhether and how legal punishment can be justified—and some of\nthe objections and difficulties that they face. A number of further\nimportant questions are relevant to theorising about punishment, which\ncan only be noted here.  \nFirst, there are questions about sentencing. (On sentencing, see\ngenerally Robinson 1987; Morris and Tonry 1990; von Hirsch 1993; Tonry\n1996; von Hirsch and Ashworth 2005; Ashworth, von Hirsch and Roberts\n2009; Frase 2012.) Who should decide what kinds and what levels of\nsentence should be attached to different offences or kinds of offence:\nwhat should be the respective roles of legislatures, of sentencing\ncouncils or commissions, of appellate courts, of trial judges, of\njuries? By what criteria should such decisions be made: how far should\nthey be guided by a retributivist principle of proportionality,\nrequiring punishments to be ‘proportionate’ in their\nseverity to the seriousness of the crime; how far by consequentialist\nconsiderations of efficient crime-prevention? What kinds of punishment\nshould be available to sentencers, and how should they decide which\nmode of punishment is appropriate for the particular offence?\nConsiderations of the meaning of different modes of punishment should\nbe central to these questions (see e.g., Lippke 2007, Hoskins 2013).\n \nSecond, there are questions about the relation between theory and\npractice — between the ideal, as portrayed by a normative theory\nof punishment, and the actualities of existing penal practice. Suppose\nwe have come to believe, as a matter of normative theory, that a\nsystem of legal punishment could in principle be justified —\nthat the abolitionist challenge can be met. It is, to put it mildly,\nunlikely that our normative theory of justified punishment will\njustify our existing penal institutions and practices: it is far more\nlikely that such a theory will show our existing practices to be\nradically imperfect — that legal punishment as it is now imposed\nis far from meaning or achieving what it should mean or achieve if it\nis to be adequately justified (see Heffernan and Kleinig 2000). If our\nnormative theorising is to be anything more than an empty intellectual\nexercise, if it is to engage with actual practice, we then face the\nquestion of what we can or should do about our current practices. The\nobvious answer is that we should strive so to reform them that they\ncan be in practice justified, and that answer is certainly available\nto consequentialists, on the plausible assumption that maintaining our\npresent practices, while also seeking their reform, is likely to do\nmore good or less harm than abandoning them. But for retributivists\nwho insist that punishment is justified only if it is just, and for\ncommunicative theorists who insist that punishment is just and\njustified only if it communicates an appropriate censure to those who\ndeserve it, the matter is harder: for to maintain our present\npractices, even while seeking their radical reform, will be to\nmaintain practices that perpetrate serious injustice (see Murphy 1973;\nDuff 2001, ch. 5). \nThird, the relation between the ideal and the actual is especially\nproblematic in the context of punishment partly because it involves\nthe preconditions of just punishment. That is to say, what makes an\nactual system of punishment unjust(ified) might be not its own\noperations as such (what punishment is or achieves within that\nsystem), but the absence of certain political, legal and moral\nconditions on which the whole system depends for its legitimacy (see\nDuff 2001, ch. 5.2). Recent scholarship on punishment has increasingly\nacknowledged that the justification of punishment depends on the\njustification of the criminal law more generally, and indeed the\nlegitimacy of the state itself (see s. 2 above). For example, if the\nstate passes laws criminalising conduct that is not justifiably\nprohibited, then this calls into question the justification of the\npunishment it imposes for violations of these laws. Questions of\ncriminalisation are thus directly relevant to punishment’s\njustification (see Husak 2008). Similarly, if the procedures by which\ncriminal justice officials apprehend, charge, and prosecute\nindividuals are unjustified, then the subsequent inflictions of\npunishment will be unjustified as well (see Ristroph 2015 and 2016; on\nspecific aspects of criminal procedure, see, e.g., Loader 2014 on\npolicing, Lippke 2011 on plea bargaining, Duff et al 2007 on criminal\ntrials, Flanders 2013 on pardons). More broadly, if a states tolerates\n(or worse, encourages) serious social injustices, then this may\nundermine the state’s standing to punish offenders who are also\nvictims of such injustices (see, e.g., Duff 2007, Holroyd 2010, Howard\n2013). \nFourth, theorists of punishment should also attend to various kinds of\ncoercive measure that can be imposed on those who have committed, or\nare thought likely to commit, crimes. These include the wide range of\nso-called ‘collateral’ consequences of criminal\nconvictions: policies restricting offenders’ access to jobs,\nhousing, public assistance, and a host of other goods; subjecting them\nto continued detention; making their criminal records publicly\navailable, and so on — often long after they have completed\ntheir formal criminal sentences. One question is whether these burdens\never themselves constitute, as some have suggested, forms of\npunishment; another question is when, if ever, such restrictive\npolicies are justifiable (see, e.g., LaFollette 2005; Ramsay 2011; de\nKeijser 2012; Hoskins 2014a, 2016, and forthcoming). Many coercive\nmeasures are imposed even on those who have not been convicted, such\nas the many kinds of restriction that may be imposed on people\nsuspected of involvement in terrorism, or housing or job restrictions\ntied merely to arrests rather than convictions. Such measures might\nnot be formally classed as punishments (one effect of which is that\nthey often escape the constraints of justice and proportionality to\nwhich punishment is subject) and are avowedly imposed for\n‘preventive’ rather than ‘punitive’ purposes:\nbut as modes of state coercion, aimed at the prevention of future\ncrimes, they clearly fall within the same normative field as\npunishment, and are as much in need of critical theorising as are our\nformally punitive institutions and practices (see Ashworth and Zedner\n2011, 2012; Ashworth, Zedner and Tomlin 2013). \nFinally, theoretical discussions of criminal punishment and its\njustification typically focus, as this discussion has focused, on\ncriminal punishment in the context of domestic criminal law. But a\ntheory of punishment must also have something to say about its aims\nand justification in the context of international criminal law —\nabout how we should understand, and whether and how we can justify,\nthe punishments imposed by such tribunals as the International\nCriminal Court: for we cannot assume that a normative theory of\ndomestic criminal punishment can simply be read across into the\ncontext of international criminal law (see Drumbl 2007). Rather, the\nimposition of punishment in the international context raises\ndistinctive conceptual and normative issues. One key question is which\ncrimes rise to the level of ‘international crimes’ and are\nthus rightly subject to prosecution and punishment by international\nrather than domestic institutions (for influential yet very different\nanswers to this question, see Altman and Wellman 2004, May 2005, Luban\n2010, and Duff 2010). Another important question is how international\ninstitutions should assign responsibility for crimes such as genocide,\nwhich are perpetrated by groups rather than by individuals acting\nalone. (Such questions arise in the domestic context as well, with\nrespect to corporations, but the magnitude of crimes such as genocide\nmakes the questions especially poignant at the international level.)\nSeveral scholars in recent years have suggested that rather than\nfocusing only on prosecuting members of the groups responsible for\nmass atrocities, it may sometimes be preferable to punish the entire\ngroup qua group. A worry for such proposals is that they risk\ninflicting punitive burdens on innocent members of the group. In\nresponse to this concern, defenders of the idea of collective\npunishment have suggested that it need not distribute among the\nmembers of the group (see Erskine 2011, Pasternak 2011, Tanguay-Renaud\n2013; but see Hoskins 2014b), or that the benefits of such punishment\nmay be valuable enough to override concerns about harm to innocents\n(see Lang 2007: 255).","contact.mail":"Zachary.Hoskins@nottingham.ac.uk","contact.domain":"nottingham.ac.uk"}]
