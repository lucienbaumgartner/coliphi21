Graham","entry":"heraclitus","body.text":"\n\n\n\nA Greek philosopher of Ephesus (near modern Kuşadası,\nTurkey) who was active around 500 BCE, Heraclitus propounded a\ndistinctive theory which he expressed in oracular language. He is best\nknown for his doctrines that things are constantly changing (universal\nflux), that opposites coincide (unity of opposites), and that fire is\nthe basic material of the world. The exact interpretation of these\ndoctrines is controversial, as is the inference often drawn from this\ntheory that in the world as Heraclitus conceives it contradictory\npropositions must be true.\n\n\n\nLittle is known of Heraclitus’ life; most of what has been handed down\nconsists of stories apparently invented to illustrate his character as\ninferred from his writings (Diogenes Laertius 9.1–17). His native\nEphesus was a prominent city of Ionia, the Greek-inhabited coast of\nAsia Minor, but was subject to Persian rule in his lifetime. According\nto one account, he inherited the honorific title and office of\n“king” of the Ionians, which he resigned to his\nbrother. He is generally considered to have favored aristocratic\ngovernment as against democracy, based on his own political\nobservations.  \n\nHis city lies close to Miletus, where the first thinkers recognized\nin later tradition as philosophers lived; but there is no record of his\nhaving made the acquaintance of any of the Milesian thinkers (Thales,\nAnaximander, Anaximenes) or having been taught by them, or of his ever\nhaving traveled. \n He is said to have written a single book (papyrus roll), and deposited\nit in the great temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The story is\nplausible enough: temples often served as depositories for money and\nother valuables, and no libraries are known from the time of\nHeraclitus. The structure of Heraclitus’ book is\ncontroversial. It could have consisted of a relatively coherent\nand consecutive argument. On the other hand, the numerous\nfragments (over one hundred) that have come down to us do not easily\nconnect with each other, even though they probably constitute a sizable\nfraction of the whole. Thus it is possible and even likely that\nthe book was composed more of sayings and epigrams than of continuous\nexposition. In its form, then, it might have looked more like a\ncollection of proverbs such as were ascribed to the seven sages than\nlike a cosmological treatise of the Milesians. Theophrastus, who\nknew his book, said that it seemed only half-finished, a kind of\nhodgepodge he attributed to the author’s melancholy.\n Diogenes Laertius reports that the work was divided (he does not\nsay by whom) into three sections, one on cosmology, one on politics\n(and ethics), and one on theology (9.5–6). All these topics are\ntreated in the extant fragments of Heraclitus, though it is often\ndifficult to see what boundaries the work might have drawn between\nthem, since Heraclitus seems to see deep interconnections between\nscience, human affairs, and theology. \n Unlike most other early philosophers, Heraclitus is usually seen as\nindependent of the several schools and movements later students\n(somewhat anachronistically) assigned to the ancients, and he himself\nimplies that he is self-taught (B101). He has been variously\njudged by ancient and modern commentators to be a material monist or a\nprocess philosopher; a scientific cosmologist, a metaphysician, or a\nmainly religious thinker; an empiricist, a rationalist, or a mystic; a\nconventional thinker or a revolutionary; a developer of logic or one\nwho denied the law of non-contradiction; the first genuine philosopher\nor an anti-intellectual obscurantist. No doubt the sage of\nEphesus will continue to remain controversial and difficult to\ninterpret, but scholars have made significant progress in understanding\nand appreciating his work. \n\nHeraclitus made every effort to break out of the mold of contemporary\nthought. Although he was influenced in a number of ways by the thought\nand language of his predecessors, including the epic poets Homer and\nHesiod, the poet and philosopher Xenophanes, the historian and\nantiquarian Hecataeus, the religious guru Pythagoras, the sage Bias of\nPriene, the poet Archilochus, and the Milesian philosophers, he\ncriticized most of them either explicitly or implicitly, and struck\nout on his own path. He rejected polumathiê or\ninformation-gathering on the grounds that it “does not teach\nunderstanding” \n(B40).[1] \nHe treated the epic poets as fools and\ncalled Pythagoras a fraud. \n In his fragments Heraclitus does not explicitly criticize the\nMilesians, and it is likely that he saw them as the most progressive of\nprevious thinkers. He does tacitly criticize Anaximander for not\nappreciating the role of injustice in the world (B80), while he might\nhave expressed some admiration for Thales (B38). His views can be\nseen to embody structural criticisms of Milesian principles, but even\nin correcting the Milesians he built on their foundations.  \n Heraclitus’ most fundamental departure from previous philosophy\nlies in his emphasis on human affairs. While he continues many of\nthe physical and cosmological theories of his predecessors, he shifts\nhis focus from the cosmic to the human realm. We might well think\nof him as the first humanist, were it not for the fact that he does not\nseem to like humanity very well. From the outset he makes it\nclear that most people are too stupid to understand his theory. \nHe may be most concerned with the human relevance of philosophic\ntheories, but he is an elitist like Plato, who thinks that only select\nreaders are capable of benefitting from his teachings. And\nperhaps for this reason he, like Plato, does not teach his\nphilosophical principles directly, but couches them in a literary form\nthat distances the author from the reader. In any case he seems\nto regard himself not as the author of a philosophy so much as the\nspokesman for an independent truth: \n\nHeraclitus stresses that the message is not his own invention, but a\ntimeless truth available to any who attend to the way the world itself\nis. “Although this Word is common,” he warns,\n“the many live as if they had a private understanding”\n(B2). The Word (account, message) exists apart from\nHeraclitus’ teaching, but he tries to convey that message to his\naudience. \n The blindness of humans is one of Heraclitus’ main themes. \nHe announces it at the beginning of his book: \n\nHe begins by warning his readers that most of them will not\nunderstand his message. He promises to “distinguish each\nthing according to its nature and show how it is,” a claim\nsimilar to the Milesians’. Yet like sleepers his readers\nwill not understand the world around them. As this implies, in\nhis book Heraclitus does have some things to say about the natural\nworld, but much more to say about the human condition. \n No less important than Heraclitus’ message is the form in which\nhe imparts it to his audience. Aristotle noticed that even in the\nfirst sentence of B1, quoted above, the force of the word\n‘forever’ was unclear: did it go with the preceding or the\nsubsequent words, with ‘being’ or ‘prove’\n(Rhetoric 1407b11–18)?  He regarded the ambiguity as a\nweakness in Heraclitus’ communication. But if we attend to\nHeraclitus’ language we see that syntactical ambiguity is more\nthan an accident: it is a common technique he uses to enrich his words\nand to infuse them with a unique verbal complexity like that of\npoetry. Charles Kahn (1979: 89) identifies two general traits of\nHeraclitus’ style, linguistic density and resonance. The\nformer is his ability to pack multiple meanings into a single word or\nphrase, the latter his ability to use one expression to evoke\nanother. To take a simple example: \n Deaths that are greater greater portions gain. (B25) \n\nHeraclitus uses alliteration (four m-words in a row) and chiasmus\n(an ABBA pattern) to link death and reward. The latter appears as\na mirror image of the former, and in sound and sense they fuse\ntogether. Another fragment consists of three words in Greek: \n The character of man is his guardian spirit. (B119) \n\nThe second word, in the dative case “to” or\n“for” man, stands between the names of two very unlike\nobjects, ‘character’ and ‘deity.’ \nGrammatically, it can attach to either indifferently, and seems\nintended to be heard with both, so that it counts twice. Because\nof its double role, the word forms a kind of syntactic glue between the\notherwise diverse subjects, joining them together in a unity. \nTraditionally having a good or a bad guardian spirit constitutes\none’s “luck”–one is eudaimôn or\ndusdaimôn, fortunate or wretched, at the mercy of\none’s divine overseer. But Heraclitus turns one’s\nluck into a function of one’s character, one’s ethical\nstance, by making “man” the link. \n Ultimately, Heraclitus loads his words with layers of meaning and\ncomplexities that are to be discovered in insights and solved like\nriddles. As he implies in the second sentence of his\nintroduction, B1, his logoi are designed to be experienced,\nnot just understood, and only those who experience them in their\nrichness will grasp his message. \n\nAlthough his words are meant to provide concrete vicarious\nencounters with the world, Heraclitus adheres to some abstract\nprinciples which govern the world. Already in antiquity he was\nfamous for advocating the coincidence of opposites, the flux doctrine,\nand his view that fire is the source and nature of all things. In\ncommenting on Heraclitus, Plato provided an early reading, followed\ntentatively by Aristotle, and popular down to the present (sharpened\nand forcefully advocated by Barnes 1982, ch. 4). According to\nBarnes’ version, Heraclitus is a material monist who believes\nthat all things are modifications of fire. Everything is in flux\n(in the sense that “everything is always flowing in some\nrespects,” 69), which entails the coincidence of opposites\n(interpreted as the view that “every pair of contraries is\nsomewhere coinstantiated; and every object coinstantiates at least one\npair of contraries,” 70). The coincidence of opposites,\nthus interpreted, entails contradictions, which Heraclitus cannot\navoid. On this view Heraclitus is influenced by the prior theory\nof material monism and by empirical observations that tend to support\nflux and the coincidence of opposites. In a time before the\ndevelopment of logic, Barnes concludes, Heraclitus violates the\nprinciples of logic and makes knowledge impossible. \n Obviously this reading is not charitable to Heraclitus. There\nare, moreover, reasons to question it. First, some of\nHeraclitus’ views are incompatible with material monism (to be\ndiscussed later), so that the background of his theories must be\nrethought. Second, there is evidence that Heraclitus’ flux\ntheory is weaker than that attributed to him by this reading. \nThird, there is evidence that his view of the coincidence of opposites\nis weaker than that attributed to him here.  \n\nBarnes bases his Platonic reading on Plato’s own\nstatement: \n\nThe established scholarly method is to try to verify Plato’s\ninterpretation by looking at Heraclitus’ own words, if\npossible. There are three alleged “river\nfragments”: \n B12. potamoisi toisin autoisin embainousin hetera kai\nhetera hudata epirrei. \n\nB49a. potamois tois autois …  \n\nB91[a]. potamôi … tôi autôi\n… \n\nOf these only the first has the linguistic density characteristic of\nHeraclitus’ words. The second starts out with the same\nthree words as B12, but in Attic, not in Heraclitus’ Ionic\ndialect, and the second clause has no grammatical connection to the\nfirst. The third is patently a paraphrase by an author famous for\nquoting from memory rather than from books. Even it starts out in\nGreek with the word ‘river,’ but in the singular. \nThere is no evidence that repetitions of phrases with variations\nare part of Heraclitus’ style (as they are of\nEmpedocles’). To start with the word ‘river(s)’\ngoes against normal Greek prose style, and on the plausible assumption\nthat all sources are trying to imitate Heraclitus, who does not repeat\nhimself, we would be led to choose B12 as the one and only river\nfragment, the only actual quotation from Heraclitus’ book. \nThis is the conclusion of  Kirk (1954) and  Marcovich (1967),\nbased on an interpretation that goes back to  Reinhardt\n(1916). That B12 is genuine is suggested by the features it\nshares with Heraclitean fragments: syntactic ambiguity (toisin\nautoisin ‘the same’ [in the dative] can be construed\neither with ‘rivers’ [“the same rivers”] or\nwith ‘those stepping in’ [“the same people”],\nwith what comes before or after), chiasmus, sound-painting (the first\nphrase creates the sound of rushing water with its diphthongs and\nsibilants), rhyme and\n alliteration.[2] \n If B12 is accepted as genuine, it tends to disqualify the other two\nalleged fragments. The major theoretical connection in the\nfragment is that between ‘same rivers’ and ‘other\nwaters.’  B12 is, among other things, a statement of the\ncoincidence of opposites. But it specifies the rivers as the\nsame. The statement is, on the surface, paradoxical, but there is\nno reason to take it as false or contradictory. It makes\nperfectly good sense: we call a body of water a river precisely because\nit consists of changing waters; if the waters should cease to flow it\nwould not be a river, but a lake or a dry streambed. There is a\nsense, then, in which a river is a remarkable kind of existent, one\nthat remains what it is by changing what it contains (cf. Hume\nTreatise 1.4.6, p. 258 Selby-Bigge). Heraclitus derives\na striking insight from an everyday encounter. Further, he\nsupplies, via the ambiguity in the first clause, another reading: on\nthe same people stepping into rivers, other and other waters\nflow. With this reading it is people who remain the same in\ncontrast to changing waters, as if the encounter with a flowing\nenvironment helped to constitute the perceiving subject as the\nsame. (See Kahn 1979.)  B49a, by contrast, contradicts the\nclaim that one can step into the same rivers (and also asserts that\nclaim), and B91[a], like Plato in the Cratylus, denies that\none can step in twice. Yet if the rivers remain the same, one\nsurely can step in twice–not into the same waters, to be sure,\nbut into the same rivers. Thus the other alleged fragments are\nincompatible with the one certifiably genuine fragment. \n In fact, Marcovich (1967) has succeeded in showing how a misreading of\nB12 could lead to an interpretation such as that embodied in A6 and\nB91[a]. It is possible to see Cratylus, a late follower of\nHeraclitus, supplying the wayward reading, and then adding his famous\nrejoinder that one cannot step into the same river even once (although\nthe reading may go back earlier to Hippias:  Mansfeld 1990:\n43–55). Since Plato is alleged to have heard Cratylus’\nlectures, he may well have derived his reading from Cratylus’\ncriticism.  \n If this interpretation is right, the message of the one river fragment,\nB12, is not that all things are changing so that we cannot encounter\nthem twice, but something much more subtle and profound. It is\nthat some things stay the same only by changing. One kind of\nlong-lasting material reality exists by virtue of constant turnover in\nits constituent matter. Here constancy and change are not opposed\nbut inextricably connected. A human body could be understood in\nprecisely the same way, as living and continuing by virtue of constant\nmetabolism–as Aristotle for instance later understood it. \nOn this reading, Heraclitus believes in flux, but not as destructive of\nconstancy; rather it is, paradoxically, a necessary condition of\nconstancy, at least in some cases (and arguably in all). In\ngeneral, at least in some exemplary cases, high-level structures\nsupervene on low-level material flux. The Platonic reading still\nhas advocates (e.g. Tarán 1999), but it is no longer the\nonly reading of Heraclitus advocated by scholars. \n\nHeraclitus’ flux doctrine is a special case of the unity of\nopposites, pointing to ways things are both the same and not the same\nover time. He depicts two key opposites that are interconnected,\nbut not identical. Heraclitus sometimes explains how things have\nopposite qualities: \n\nBarnes thinks Heraclitus gets his doctrine of the universal\ncoinstantiation of contraries through fallaciously dropping qualifiers\n(such as: ‘for fish,’ ‘for men’). But B61\nshows he is perfectly aware of them, and we might rather say that he\nunderstands them tacitly even when he does not utter them. When\nhe says, \n\nhe does not contradict himself. There are perfectly good\ncontexts in which everything he says is true. One can divide a\ncollection into its parts or join the parts into a unified\nwhole.  \n Most tellingly, Heraclitus explains just how contraries are\nconnected: \n\nContrary qualities are found in us “as the same\nthing.”  But they are the same by virtue of one thing\nchanging around to another. We are asleep and we wake up; we are\nawake and we go to sleep. Thus sleep and waking are both found in\nus, but not at the same time or in the same respect. Indeed, if\nsleeping and waking were identical, there would be no change as\nrequired by the second sentence. Contraries are the same by\nvirtue of constituting a system of connections: alive-dead,\nwaking-sleeping, young-old. Subjects do not possess incompatible\nproperties at the same time, but at different times. \n In general, what we see in Heraclitus is not a conflation of opposites\ninto an identity, but a series of subtle analyses revealing the\ninterconnectedness of contrary states in life and in the world. \nThere is no need to impute to him a logical fallacy. Opposites\nare a reality, and their interconnections are real, but the correlative\nopposites are not identical to each other. \n\nThe standard view of Heraclitus’ ontology since Aristotle is\nthat he is a material monist who holds that fire is the ultimate\nreality; all things are just manifestations of fire. According to\nAristotle the Milesians in general were material monists who advocated\nother kinds of ultimate matter: Thales water, Anaximander the\nboundless, Anaximenes air (Metaphysics 983b6–984a8). So\nHeraclitus’ theory was just another version of a common\nbackground theory. There are problems already with\nAristotle’s understanding of the Milesians: Aristotle lacks any\ntextual evidence for Thales’ view and must reconstruct it out of\nalmost nothing; he sometimes treats Anaximander as a pluralist like\nAnaxagoras who thinks the boundless is a mixture of qualities; at most\nAnaximenes might exemplify material monism–but Plato reads him as\na pluralist (Timaeus 39 with Graham 2003b; Graham\n2003a). In the case of Heraclitus, his own statements make\nmaterial monism problematic as an interpretation. According to\nmaterial monism, some kind of matter is the ultimate reality, and any\nvariation in the world consists merely of qualitative or possibly\nquantitative change in it; for there is only one reality, for instance\nfire, which can never come into existence or perish, but can only\nchange in its appearances. Heraclitus, however, advocates a\nradical kind of change: \n\n(Here soul seems to occupy the place of fire.)  The language of\nbirth and death in the world of living things is precisely the language\nused in Greek metaphysics for coming to be and perishing. It\nimplies a radical transformation that rules out continuing identity\n(cf. B76, B62). Indeed, interpreters of Heraclitus cannot have it\nboth ways: Heraclitus cannot be both a believer in radical flux (the\nchange of everything into everything else: fire into water, water into\nearth, and so on) and an advocate of monism. Either he must\nbelieve in a merely illusory or at most a limited kind of change, or he\nmust be a pluralist.  \n One further difficulty remains for the monist reading. In his\nalleged version of monism, fire is the ultimate reality. Yet fire\n(as the ancients recognized) is the least substantial and the most\nevanescent of elemental stuffs. It makes a better symbol of\nchange than of permanence. Other alleged cases of material monism\noffer a basic kind of matter that could arguably be stable and\npermanent over long periods of time; but fire manifests “need and\nsatiety” (B65), a kind of ongoing consumption that can live only\nby devouring fuel. Is not Heraclitus’ choice of a basic reality itself\nparadoxical?  At best his appeal to fire seems to draw on material\nmonism in a way that points beyond the theory to an account  in\nwhich the process of change is more real than the material substances\nthat undergo change. \n\nAlthough Heraclitus is more than a cosmologist, he does offer a\ncosmology. His most fundamental statement on cosmology is found\nin B30: \n\nIn this passage, he uses, for the first time in any extant Greek\ntext, the word kosmos “order” to mean something\nlike “world.”  He identifies the world with fire, but\ngoes on to specify portions of fire that are kindling and being\nquenched. Although ancient sources, including Aristotle (On\nthe Heavens 279b12–17) as well as the Stoics, attributed to\nHeraclitus a world that was periodically destroyed by fire and then\nreborn, the present statement seems to contradict that view, as Hegel\nalready noticed. If the world always was and is and will be, then\nit does not perish and come back into existence, though portions of it\n(measures of fire) are constantly being transformed.  \n Heraclitus describes the transformations of elementary bodies: \n\n<Earth> is liquefied as sea and measured into the same\nproportion as it had before it became earth. (B31[b]) \n\nFire turns into water (“sea”), and then half of that\nquantity turns into earth and half into “fireburst”\n(prêstêr, a fiery, windy kind of storm\nphenomenon). The portion that becomes earth turns back into\nwater, in the same quantity it had previously. Here Heraclitus\nenvisages a lawlike transformation of stuff from fire to water to\nearth; the transformation is reversible, and in it the same relative\nquantities of stuff are preserved. There is, then, a kind of\nconservation of matter, or at least overall quantity of matter. \nWhat would make the world to be continuous would be the fact that when\none portion of fire turns into water, an equivalent portion of water\nturns into fire. The overall equilibrium is preserved, even if\nthe water that is now in the sea is not the same water as was in it\nbefore. This picture bears a similarity to the image of the\nriver, which remains the same despite its changing material\ncontents.  \n In this view of the world, the mutual transformations of matter are not\nan accidental feature, but the very essence of nature. Without\nchange, there would be no world. Heraclitus seems to acknowledge\nthis in his praise of war and strife: \n\nWar is father of all and king of all; and some he manifested as\ngods, some as men; some he made slaves, some free. (B53) \n\nConflicting powers of opposites, including those of elemental\nbodies, make possible the world and all its variety; without that\nconflict we would have only lifeless uniformity. In the former\npassage Heraclitus is perhaps criticizing Anaximander for his view that\ncosmic justice consists of a punishment of powers that overstep their\nboundaries (Anaximander B1). Justice is not the correction of an\nexcess, but the whole pattern of the domination of one opposite\nfollowed by that of the other.  \n There is, however, a guiding force in the world: \n\nThe fiery shaft of lightning is a symbol of the direction of the\nworld. Anaximander may have already used the image of the\nshipmaster of the universe (Kahn 1960: 238). Heraclitus identifies it\nwith the thunderbolt, itself an attribute of Zeus the storm god. \nThe changes wrought by and symbolized by fire govern the world. \nThe ruling power of the universe can be identified with Zeus, but not\nin a straightforward way: “One being, the only wise one, would\nand would not be called by the name of Zeus” (B32). And\nhere the word used for ‘Zeus’ can be rendered\n“Life.”  Like the Milesians, Heraclitus identifies the\nruling power of the world with deity, but (like them also) his\nconception is not a conventional one.  \n Heraclitus provided some sort of discussion of meteorological and\nastronomical phenomena. He studied the disappearance and\nreappearance of the moon at the end and beginning of a month\n(Oxyrhynchus Papyri LIII 3710 ii. 43–47 and iii. 7–11–the\nclearest evidence that Heraclitus had a scientific interest in\nastronomy). He explained the sun and moon as bowls full of\nfire. As the moon’s bowl rotated it caused the\nphases. Eclipses were the result of a rotation of the convex side\nof the bowls to face the earth. We have no reports about the\nearth itself, but we may suppose that, like his predecessors,\nHeraclitus viewed it as flat. Evaporations from the earth and sea\napparently provided fuel for the heavenly bodies, which burned like oil\nlamps.  \n Divine power is manifest in all phenomena: “God is day night,\nwinter summer, war peace, satiety hunger, and he alters just as\n<fire> when it is mixed with spices is named according to the\naroma of each of them” (B67). Again Heraclitus seems to\nstress the unity of divine power, even if humans assign different names\nand attributes to it. All things that happen are good, but humans\ndo not perceive them to be so: “To God all things are fair, good\nand just, but men suppose some things are unjust, some just”\n(B102). Heraclitus does not attempt to provide a detailed\ntheodicy, but seeks to view all things sub specie\naeternitatis, in which conflict (including presumably human\nconflict) keeps the world going (B80, cited above).  \n\nPlato held that for Heraclitus knowledge is made impossible by the\nflux of sensible objects. Yet Heraclitus does not repudiate\nknowledge or the wisdom that comes from a proper understanding of the\nworld. To be sure, he believes most people are not capable of\nwisdom; understanding is a rare and precious commodity, which even most\nreputed sages do not attain to (B28[a]). Yet wisdom is possible,\nand it is embodied in Heraclitus’ message, for those who can\ndiscern it. \n Heraclitus seems to accept the evidence of the senses as in some way\nvaluable: “The things of which there is sight, hearing,\nexperience, I prefer” (B55). Sight is the best of the\nsenses: “The eyes are more accurate witnesses than the\nears” (B101a). Yet in contrast to those who view knowledge\nas an accumulation of information or wisdom as a collection of sayings,\nhe requires much more than sensation and memory: \n\nIn this statement Heraclitus reviews the leading authorities of his\nday, living (the last three) and dead, dealing with religious and\nsecular knowledge, and finds them all wanting. They spend too\nmuch effort in collecting information and not enough in grasping its\nmeaning. “What intelligence or understanding do they [the\npeople] have?” asks Heraclitus. “They follow popular\nbards and treat the crowd as their instructor, not realizing that the\nmany are base, while the few are noble” (B104). He\ncriticizes Hesiod on specifics: “The teacher of the multitude is\nHesiod; they believe he has the greatest knowledge–who did not\ncomprehend day and night: for they are one” (B57). In his\nmyths, Hesiod treats Day and Night as separate persons, taking turns\ntraveling abroad, while one remains at home. But this fails to\ncapture the interconnectedness of day and night, and falsifies\nreality. Heraclitus criticizes Homer, Pythagoras and Archilochus\nfor their inadequacies.  \n In general, he holds that people do not learn what they should:\n“Many do not understand such things as they encounter, nor do\nthey learn by their experience, but they think they do”\n(B17). Indeed, they do not process the information they receive:\n“Having heard without comprehension they are like the deaf; this\nsaying bears witness to them: present they are absent”\n(B34). Heraclitus explains: “Poor witnesses for men are the\neyes and ears of those who have barbarian souls” (B107). A\nbarbarian was a non-Greek; just as a foreigner hears Greek words\nwithout understanding their meaning, most people perceive without\nunderstanding the world around them. Sense perception is\nnecessary for knowledge, but not sufficient; without the ability to\ndecipher information from the senses, one cannot understand the\nworld. \n What chance is there then to learn the secrets of the world? \nHeraclitus is not wholly pessimistic about human cognitive abilities:\n“All men have a share in self-knowledge and sound thinking”\n(B116). What is needed is not simply more sense experience or\nmore information, but an improved way of comprehending the message\n(logos) that the world offers. In this context his\ncurious method of expression begins to make sense. He presents\nhis statements in the form of puzzles, riddles, aperçus. \nMany of them support two or more readings, and contain hidden\ninsights. To comprehend them the reader must grasp their\ncomplexity and then discover their unity. To read Heraclitus\nappropriately is to have a rich cognitive experience, as the\nphilosopher hints in his introduction (B1). \n Heraclitus often presents a simple concrete situation or image which\nhas implications for our understanding of the world: a river, a bow, a\nroad. He does not generally pronounce generalizations and deduce\nconsequences. Rather, his method can be seen as inductive: he offers\nan example which suggests general principles. Unlike most\nphilosophers, he challenges the right brain rather than the\nleft.  He does not teach in the conventional sense; he offers his\nreaders materials for understanding and lets them educate\nthemselves. He cites with approval a model of religious\ninstruction: \n\nThe riddling statements of the Delphic oracle do not provide\nstraightforward answers, but force people to interpret them. His\ntruths come to the attentive reader as discoveries resulting from the\nsolution of a puzzle. \n\nThe aim of Heraclitus’ unusual approach is to produce readers\nwho have a proper grasp of the world and their place in it. \n“Sound thinking is the greatest virtue and wisdom: to speak the\ntruth and to act on the basis of an understanding of the nature of\nthings” (B112). Such an understanding can result only from\nan ability to interpret the language of nature. The proper\nunderstanding allows one to act in a harmonious way. \n Heraclitus urges moderation and self-control in a somewhat\nconventional way (B85, B43). He also recommends the conventional Greek\ngoal of seeking fame: “The best choose one thing above all, the\neverlasting fame of mortals; the many gorge themselves like\ncattle” (B29). To die in battle is a superior kind of death\n(B24). Those who drink to excess make their souls wet, and accordingly\nharm them (B117), for a healthy soul is dry (B118).  Those who\nexperience better deaths attain better rewards (B25).  Those who\nlie will be punished (B28[b]). “For men who die there await\nthings they do not expect or anticipate” (B27).  Some of\nthese remarks tend to suggest an afterlife with rewards and\npunishment, although his belief in a continued existence is\ncontroversial (see Nussbaum 1972). In any case, Heraclitus views the\nsoul as the moral and cognitive center of human experience. \n In political theory he maintains that one good man is worth ten\nthousand ordinary people (B49). He criticizes his fellow citizens\nfor banishing a distinguished leader: \n\nEvidently he trusts the few and distrusts the many. He sees\ngood laws as being reflections of universal principles: \n\nThe divine law, on Heraclitus’ view, is probably continuous\nwith the laws governing the cosmos, which maintain justice through\nopposition (B80). \n\nAlthough Heraclitus is not known to have had students, his writings\nseem to have been influential from an early time. He may have\nprovoked Parmenides to develop a contrasting philosophy (Patin 1899;\nGraham 2002), although their views have much more in common than is\ngenerally recognized (Nehamas 2002). Empedocles seems to have\ninvoked Heraclitean themes, and some Hippocratic treatises imitated\nHeraclitean language and presented applications of Heraclitean\nthemes. Democritus echoed many of Heraclitus’ ethical\npronouncements in his own ethics. From an early time Heraclitus was\nseen as the representative of universal flux in contrast to Parmenides,\nthe representative of universal stasis. Cratylus brought\nHeraclitus’ philosophy to Athens, where Plato heard it. \nPlato seems to have used Heraclitus’ theory (as interpreted by\nCratylus) as a model for the sensible world, as he used\nParmenides’ theory for the intelligible world. As\nmentioned, both Plato and Aristotle viewed Heraclitus as violating the\nlaw of non-contradiction, and propounding an incoherent theory of\nknowledge based on a radical flux. Yet Aristotle also treated him\nas a coherent material monist who posited fire as an ultimate\nprinciple. The Stoics used Heraclitus’ physics as the\ninspiration for their own, understanding him to advocate a periodic\ndestruction of the world by fire, followed by a regeneration of the\nworld; Cleanthes in particular commented on Heraclitus. \nAenesidemus interpreted Heraclitus as a kind of proto-skeptic (see\nPolito 2004).  \n Ever since Plato, Heraclitus has been seen as a philosopher of\nflux. The challenge in interpreting the philosopher of Ephesus has\nalways been to find a coherent theory in his paradoxical\nutterances. Since Hegel, he has been seen as a paradigmatic process\nphilosopher–perhaps with some justification.  \n\nThe recently published Derveni Papyrus, discovered in a tomb in\nnorthern Greece, contains a commentary on an Orphic poem. The\ncommentator discusses some passages of Heraclitus in connection with\nthe poem, namely B3 + B94 (which may have been thus joined in\nHeraclitus’ book) (column 4). See Betegh 2004. The Oxyrhynchus\nPapyri (vol. 53, no. 3710) also show that Heraclitus was interested in\ndetermining the days of the lunar month and thus in scientific\nquestions. See Burkert 1993. \nIn recent work, scholars have devoted special attention to\nHeraclitus’ moral and political theory (Fattal 2011, Sider 2013,\nRobitzsch 2018), to questions of logos and rationality (Hülsz\n2013, Long 2013), to the material character of soul (Betegh 2007), and\nto the theory of elemental change (Neels 2018).\n ","contact.mail":"daniel_graham@byu.edu","contact.domain":"byu.edu"}]
