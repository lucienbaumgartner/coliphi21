Moral realists hold that there\nare objective, mind-independent facts and properties; moral\nnaturalists hold that these objective, mind-independent moral facts are\nnatural facts. ‘Moral naturalism’ can also be used as a\nlabel for views in normative ethics which hold that things are good if\nthey are natural, or as a label for any view in metaethics which is\nconsistent with a general metaphysical naturalism. But naturalistic\nmoral realism is the subject of this entry. Moral naturalism appeals\nto many, since it combines the advantages of naturalism and realism,\nbut others have argued that moral naturalism does inadequate justice\nto central dimensions of our practice with moral concepts. In this\nentry, we examine the most prominent arguments for and against moral\nnaturalism, and profile three of the most popular and influential\nversions of moral naturalism.\n\n\n\nThere is a broad sense of “moral naturalism” whereby a\nmoral naturalist is someone who believes an adequate philosophical\naccount of morality can be given in terms entirely consistent with a\nnaturalistic position in philosophical inquiry more generally. As\nscience has developed over the last several centuries, it has seemed\nto many that the kinds of facts that scientists investigate through\nempirical methods are the only kinds of facts that there are. Religion\nand superstition have fallen by the wayside; the only things that we\nought to believe in are the kinds of things that science can tell us\nabout. This increasingly common attitude combines a metaphysical\ndoctrine—that the only things that exist are natural\nthings—with an epistemological doctrine—that we know\nabout the world strictly by the use of experimentation and other\nempirical methods. Moral naturalism refers to any version of moral\nrealism that is consistent with this general philosophical naturalism.\nMoral realism is the view that there are objective, mind-independent\nmoral facts. For the moral naturalist, then, there are objective moral\nfacts, these facts are facts concerning natural things, and we know\nabout them using empirical methods. \n\nNaturalism in this sense is opposed by those who reject a parsimonious\nnaturalistic metaphysics and stand willing to allow a domain of\nnonnatural or supernatural facts to play an essential role in our\nunderstanding of morality. Naturalism is also opposed by\n“anti-realists”, including error theorists,\nconstructivists, relativists, and expressivists. According to error\ntheorists, there are no moral facts of any kind. And according to\nconstructivists, relativists, and expressivists, there are moral\nfacts, but these facts are subjective, rather than objective.\nAnti-realists hold that, if there are any moral facts, these facts are\nmerely products of our contingent attitudes. Anti-realists are\ntypically moral naturalists according to the more general definition\nof ‘moral naturalism’, as anti-realists typically attempt\nto understand morality in terms that are consistent with general\nphilosophical naturalism. But for the purposes of this entry,\nanti-realism should be understood as opposed to moral naturalism. \n\nWe have said that moral naturalism is a conjunction of three\nclaims: \n\nMoral Realism: There are objective, mind-independent\nmoral facts. \n\nMetaphysical Naturalism: Moral facts are natural\nfacts. \n\nEpistemic Naturalism: We know moral claims are true\nin the same way that we know about claims in the natural sciences. \n\nBut moral naturalism is sometimes associated with a fourth,\nlinguistic claim, about the nature of moral language. That\nclaim is: \n\nAnalytic Naturalism: Our moral claims are\nsynonymous with certain (highly complex) claims in the\nnatural sciences. \n\nOf these four claims, Metaphysical Naturalism is often taken to be the\nclaim that is most central to the doctrine of moral naturalism. The\ndebate between naturalists and non-naturalists is typically taken to\nbe a debate about the nature of moral properties. Are those properties\nnatural or non-natural?—this seems to be a\nstraightforward metaphysical question. \n\nBut Metaphysical Naturalism is not an unproblematic thesis. What does\nthe naturalness of a fact or property consist in, exactly?\nThat’s a pretty basic question, but philosophers are often left\nembarrassingly tongue-tied when called on to answer it. Some claim\n(e.g., Bedke 2009, Enoch 2010, Lutz forthcoming) that natural\nproperties or facts are those that have causal\nor explanatory power, while others have attempted to\ndistinguish natural properties from non-natural properties in other\nmetaphysical terms (see McPherson 2015). But the difficulty of\ndefining a “natural” property, often combined with a\ngeneral Humean or Kantian skepticism about philosophers’ ability\nto meaningfully investigate any metaphysical questions, has made many\nphilosophers wary of discussing Metaphysical Naturalism\ndirectly. Accordingly, many define moral naturalism through the lens\nof Analytic Naturalism or Epistemic Naturalism. \n\nWe might define a “natural fact” not in metaphysical\nterms, but rather in linguistic terms: as the kind of fact about which\nwe make certain kinds of claims—natural or\ndescriptive claims. Claims are or are not\n“natural” depending on what kind of terminology they use.\nClaims that use normative terminology like ‘good’,\n‘bad’, ‘right’, ‘wrong’, etc. are\nnormative claims. Claims that avoid this use of evaluative\nterminology, and instead use terminology common to the natural\nsciences, are natural claims. If moral claims and natural claims are\nsynonymous, as the Analytic Naturalist holds, then moral and natural\nclaims must refer to the same facts. If the moral claims refer to the\nsame facts that natural claims refer to, it follows that moral claims\nrefer to natural facts. Thus, Analytic Naturalism can provide us with\na sensible and tractable explanation of how moral facts could be\n“natural” facts (Parfit 2011, chapters 24–25). \n\nAlternatively, we might define ‘natural facts’ in\nepistemic terms: as those facts that can only be investigated through\nempirical methods. Thus, if we accept Metaphysical Naturalism and\nhold that moral facts are “natural”, this entails\nEpistemic Naturalism—that moral facts are the kinds of facts\nthat we investigate using empirical methods. Shafer-Landau (2003)\ndefines a ‘natural’ fact in these epistemic terms, and so,\nbecause he believes that we can know moral facts by using intuition\n(which is not an empirical method), he rejects moral naturalism. \n\nIt might be tempting to say that moral naturalism should, properly\nunderstood, consist in the conjunction of Epistemic, Metaphysical, and\nAnalytic Naturalism. But that suggestion would be unacceptable, as\nthere is a strong tension between Epistemic Naturalism and Analytic\nNaturalism. If Analytic Naturalism is true, then it should be possible\n(at least in principle) to go through a process of conceptual analysis\nthat would reveal the synonymy between moral claims and claims in the\nnatural sciences. But if this is possible, then substantive moral\nprinciples are knowable a priori—which, in turn,\nentails that substantive moral principles are not known in the same\nway as scientific principles. Analytic Naturalism therefore seems to\nentail that Epistemic Naturalism is false, and vice versa. Naturalists\nwho accept Analytic Naturalism are called, appropriately enough,\nanalytic naturalists. Naturalists who reject Analytic\nNaturalism are synthetic naturalists, since they hold that\nclaims regarding relations between the moral and the natural are\nsynthetic rather than analytic. \n\nThis is not to say that analytic naturalists allow no room for\nempirical investigation into morality—far from it. If, for\ninstance, an analytic naturalist were to hold that the term\n‘good’ is synonymous with ‘pleasurable’, they\nwould hold that the claim “Pleasure is good” is analytic,\nand knowable a priori. But the claim “It is good to\nhelp others” would be the kind of claim that is amenable to\nempirical investigation, in virtue of the fact that “It is good\nto help others” would be synonymous with “It is pleasant\nto help others”, and whether pleasure results from helping\nothers is the kind of claim that can be empirically investigated. So\nanalytic naturalists should be understood as saying that some\nmoral claims—in particular, moral claims that state general\nrelations between natural properties and moral properties (like\n“Pleasure is good”)—are knowable a\npriori. Synthetic naturalists claim that all moral\nclaims are synthetic claims, knowable by empirical methods. \n\nIn sum, while any moral naturalist will agree with the statement that\nmoral facts are natural facts, different philosophers will mean\ndifferent things by that statement. \n\nMoral naturalism is an attractive view. As a form of realism, it\noffers to make robust sense of moral objectivity and moral knowledge,\nallowing for moral utterances to be truth-apt in straightforward ways\nand for some of them to be true. And as a form of naturalism it is\nwidely seen as preferable to rival forms of moral realism. Moral\nproperties and facts, realistically construed, can often seem\nunpalatably “queer”, as Mackie famously expressed it\n(Mackie 1977, chapter 1, section 9): a realist can seem committed to\nthe existence of metaphysically far out entities or properties and\nembarrassed by the lack of any plausible epistemic story of how we can\nobtain knowledge of them. The naturalist offers to save realism but\neliminate the mystery. \n\nMoral realism and general philosophical naturalism are both\nattractive views in their own right. Moral realism seems necessary to\ndo justice to do our sense of right and wrong being more than a matter\nof opinion, and philosophical naturalism has proven to be the most\nsuccessful project, ever, for advancing human knowledge and\nunderstanding. And while anti-realists and non-naturalists dispute\nrealism and naturalism, respectively, moral naturalism is a plausible\nconjunction of two plausible views. \n\nIn recent years, moral non-naturalism has been the subject of much\nmore discussion than moral naturalism, as moral non-naturalists have\ndiscovered new ways of articulating and defending their view. But\nalong with an increase in the popularity of moral non-naturalism,\nthere has been a corresponding increase in the popularity of arguments\nagainst non-naturalism. These arguments, indirectly, provide support\nfor moral naturalism. If there are arguments that have force against\nthe moral non-naturalist, but not the naturalist, then these arguments\ngive us reason to be naturalists about morality. While many objections\ncan and have been offered against non-naturalism, we’ll look at\nthe two most prominent here. \n\nThe first argument against normative non-naturalism concerns normative\nsupervenience. The normative supervenes on the natural; in all\nmetaphysically possible worlds in which the natural facts are the same\nas they are in the actual world, the moral facts are the same as\nwell. This claim has been called the “least controversial thesis\nin metaethics” (Rosen forthcoming); it is very widely accepted.\nBut it is also a striking fact that stands in need of some\nexplanation. For naturalists, such an explanation is easy to provide:\nthe moral facts just are natural facts, so when we consider\nworlds that are naturally the same as the actual world, we\nwill ipso facto be considering worlds that are morally the\nsame as the actual world. But for the non-naturalist, no such\nexplanation seems available. In fact, it seems to be in principle\nimpossible for a non-naturalist to explain how the moral\nsupervenes on the natural. And if the non-naturalist can offer no\nexplanation of this phenomenon that demands explanation, this is a\nheavy mark against non-naturalism (McPherson 2012). \n\nIt is highly controversial whether this argument succeeds (for\ndiscussion, see McPherson (2012), Enoch (2011, Ch. 6), Wielenberg\n(2014, Ch. 1), Leary 2017, Väyrynen 2017, Rosen forthcoming,). But if\nit does succeed, then it provides a good reason to think that moral\nproperties, if they exist, must be natural properties. \n\nThe second argument against moral non-naturalism concerns moral\nepistemology. According to evolutionary debunking\narguments, our moral beliefs are products of evolution, and\nthis evolutionary etiology of our moral beliefs serves to undermine\nthem. Exactly why evolution debunks our moral beliefs is a\nmatter of substantial controversy, and the debunking argument has been\ninterpreted in a number of different ways (Vavova 2015). Sharon Street,\nwhose statement of the evolutionary debunking argument has been highly\ninfluential, holds that debunking arguments make a problem for all\nversions of moral realism—her paper is entitled “A\nDarwinian Dilemma for Realist Theories of Value.” But according\nto another popular line of argument, these debunking arguments are only\nproblems for moral non-naturalism. The fundamental worry is that our\nmoral beliefs are the product of evolutionary facts rather\nthan moral facts. If this is so, this would serve to debunk our\nmoral beliefs, either because it is a necessary condition on justified\nbelief that you take your beliefs to be explained by the facts in\nquestion (Joyce 2006, Ch. 6; Bedke 2009; Lutz forthcoming) or else because the\nnon-naturalist is left with no way to explain the reliability of our\nmoral beliefs (Enoch 2009, Schechter 2017). \n\nBut if moral naturalism is true, the realist needn’t grant the\nskeptic’s premise that our moral beliefs are the product of\nevolutionary facts rather than moral facts. If moral facts are\nnatural, then we needn’t see moral facts as being contrary to\nnatural, evolutionary facts. The moral facts might be among\nthese evolutionary facts that explain our moral beliefs. If, for\ninstance, to be good just is to be conducive to social\ncooperation, then an evolutionary account that says that we judge\nthings to be good only when they are conducive to social cooperation\nwould not debunk any of our beliefs about goodness. This account would,\ninstead, provide a deep vindication of those beliefs (Copp 2008). \n\nIt is open to naturalists to say that the moral facts are wholly or\npartly responsible for us having the moral beliefs that we have. This\nallows them to address any number of different epistemic objections\nthat the moral non-naturalist seems ill-equipped to answer. If these\nobjections do succeed against only the non-naturalist, that’s a good\nreason to think that moral properties, if they exist, must be natural\nproperties. \n\nWe’ve just seen that there is some reason to think that, if\nthere are any moral properties, those properties must be natural moral\nproperties. In this section, we’ll look at the most prominent\nobjections to moral naturalism. \n\nBy far the most famous and influential argument against moral\nnaturalism is G.E. Moore’s Open Question Argument (Moore 1903,\n5–21). Moore’s thought is as follows. Suppose\n“\\(N\\)” to abbreviate a term expressing the concept of\nsome natural property \\(N\\), maximally conducing to human\nwelfare perhaps, and suppose a naturalist proposes to define\ngoodness as \\(N\\)-ness. We swiftly show this to be false by supposing\nsomeone to ask of something acknowledged to be \\(N\\), whether it was\ngood. This, Moore urges, is an open question. The point is,\nessentially, that it is not a stupid question in the sort of way,\n“I acknowledge that Jimmy is an unmarried man but is he, I\nwonder, a bachelor?” is a stupid question: if you need to ask\nit, you don’t understand it. Given what the words concerned\nmean, the question of whether a given unmarried man is a bachelor is,\nin Moore’s terminology, closed—there is no way for a\nconceptually competent individual to be in doubt about the answer to\nthis question. So goodness and \\(N\\)-ness, unlike bachelorhood and\nunmarried-man-hood, are not one and the same. \n\nOf course the concepts may be coextensive. For all the Open\nQuestion Argument shows, it may be the case, for instance, that a\nthing is good if and only if it conduces to welfare: utilitarianism of\nthat kind might be a synthetic moral truth. But what the Open Question\nArgument is supposed to rule out is that “good” and\n“\\(N\\)” pick out, in virtue of semantic equivalence, not\ntwo distinct and coextensive properties, but rather one and the same\nproperty. As Moore emphasizes, we should distinguish the question,\n“What is goodness?” from the question “What things\nare good?” (1903, 5) The Open Question Argument is supposed to\nrule out certain answers to the first question, i.e., naturalistic\nanswers such as “conduciveness to happiness.” But it is\nnot meant to rule out our answering the second question by offering,\ne.g., “those things which conduce to happiness.” \n\nA lot of fire has been directed at this little argument in the\ncentury since Moore published it. A central worry is that he failed to\nconsider a crucial possibility. Consider the biconditional: \n\n\\(x\\) is good iff \\(x\\) is \\(N\\). \n\nMoore, as we saw, notes that this may express a claim about what\ngoodness is or a claim about what things are good. The former claim he\nunderstands as a claim that “good” and\n“\\(N\\)” are equivalent in meaning and so denote the\nvery same property. He failed, however, to notice the possibility that\nthey might denote the very same property even though they are\nnot equivalent in meaning. The assumption at work here David\nBrink calls “the Semantic Test for Properties”, according\nto which two terms pick out the same property only if they mean the\nsame (Brink 1989, chapter 6 and Brink 2001). Brink thinks we can be\nconfident that this assumption is false (and all the more so if we\nunderstand sameness of meaning as something epistemically transparent\nto competent speakers so that epistemic inequivalence implies semantic\ninequivalence). One counterexample is by now proverbial: \n\n\\(x\\) is water iff \\(x\\) is H\\(_2\\)O. \n\nIt seems obvious that “water” doesn’t mean the same as\n“H\\(_2\\)O” (and all the more so if we take speakers as\nauthoritative as to what their words mean). For it was a discovery when\n18th century chemists figured this fact out. But being\nwater and being H\\(_2\\)O are not just a case of a pair of coextensive\nproperties, such as being a cordate and being a renate. Being water and\nbeing H\\(_2\\)O are one and the same identical property, the property\nidentity in question being a posteriori, not a priori\nand certainly not analytic. So the Open Question Argument cannot refute\nMetaphysical Naturalism. At most, the Open Question Argument gives us a\nreason to be synthetic, rather than analytic, naturalists. \n\nBut it is not clear that the Open Question Argument proves even this\nmuch. Another criticism, forcefully urged by Michael Smith, is that\nthe Open Question Argument seems to prove too much, being just a\nparticular instance of the piece of reasoning embodied in the Paradox\nof Analysis. The practice of conceptual analysis, this reasoning goes,\naspires to provide real philosophical illumination; however, if all\nanalytic truths have to be as obvious as “a bachelor is an\nunmarried male”, then all pieces of conceptual analysis must be\neither false or trivial. That conclusion would be highly embarrassing\nto much modern philosophy (Smith 1994, 37–39).  But once we\nallow that analytic truths may be unobvious, the appearance of\nopenness in the question whether an \\(N\\) thing is a good thing ceases\nto look very significant. \n\nA further criticism of the Open Question Argument comes from William\nFrankena (1939). Frankena worries that the Open Question Argument begs\nthe question at issue. “Is such-and-such, which is \\(N\\),\ngood?” is an open question precisely when a definition of\n\\(N\\)-ness in terms of goodness is not an analytic truth—and\nthat is precisely what Moore is trying to establish. Moore seems to\nowe us more support than has been given for the claim that all\nquestions concerning natural-moral identities are open. \n\nOne might claim that the failure of other attempted analyses of\n‘good’ gives us a kind of inductive reason to think that\nno analysis of goodness can be successful. This inductive argument, if\nsuccessful, might answer Frankena’s objection. But it is not\nclear how strong such an inductive argument is. As Finlay (2014,\nCh. 1) argues, if it is true that goodness can be analyzed, the very\ntruth of that hypothesis predicts that every analysis except the\ncorrect one will be false. Thus, it also predicts that every\nquestion of the form ‘\\(X\\) is \\(N\\), but is \\(X\\) good?’\nwill feel open, except for the one question that includes the\ncorrect analysis of goodness in place of \\(N\\). So we should not take\nthe existence of open questions of the form ‘\\(X\\) is \\(N\\), but\nis \\(X\\) good?’ as data against the hypothesis that\n‘good’ can be analyzed, since that data is actually\npredicted by the hypothesis. The only way to know that an analysis\nfails is to test it, and it’s always possible that the correct\nanalysis remains untested. \n\nAlthough Moore’s original version of the Open Question Argument\ntoday has few defenders, there have been a number of recent attempts\nto refashion it into a more compelling form. One popular version of\nthe Open Question Argument, called the Normativity Objection (Scanlon\n2014; Parfit 2011), sidesteps questions about the cognitive\nsignificance of moral and descriptive terminology and appeals to\nconsiderations regarding the natures of natural and normative\nfacts. Moral facts tell us what is good in the world and what\nwe have reasons or obligations to do. Natural\nfacts—the kinds of facts that scientists study—are facts\nabout the innate physical structure of the universe and the causal\nprinciples that govern the interaction of matter. Those are obviously\njust two different kinds of facts. Moral facts, because they are facts\nabout goodness, reasons, obligations, and the like,\nare normative facts. But natural facts are not normative. In\ntrying to give a naturalistic account of morality, naturalists forgot\nthe most important thing: that moral facts aren’t purely facts\nabout the way the world is; they are facts about\nwhat matters. \n\nThere are, generally, two ways in which a naturalist might respond\nto this objection. First, a naturalist could say that moral facts\naren’t essentially normative; it may be the case that we\ntypically have reasons to act morally, but reason-giving\nforce is not part of the essence of moral facts. That suggestion might\nhave the feeling of an absurdity—of course moral facts are the\nkinds of things that provide reasons; if an action is morally\nrequired, that’s a good reason to do it! But according to some\n“reforming definitions” of morality (Brandt 1979; Railton\n1986), while we may intuitively think that moral facts give reasons,\nthat is a kind of defect in our conception of morality. It would be\nmore accurate and fruitful to define moral facts in terms that are not\nnecessarily reason-providing. Thinking about moral facts in this way\nis different than how we typically think about moral facts—that\nis why this kind of account constitutes a reforming\ndefinition of morality—but we are talking about morality\nall the same (Railton 1986). \n\nThe biggest problem for reforming definitions is that they suggest\nthat normativity is somehow dispensable to morality. But as Joyce\n(2000, Ch. 1) argues, normativity is a non-negotiable\ncommitment of our moral discourse. If the only kinds of facts that\nexist are natural, and natural facts are not a source of reasons for\neveryone, then, argues Joyce, this amounts to a proof that moral facts\ndon’t exist. Reformers may respond by calling into question\nJoyce’s notion of “non-negotiable” commitments. For\nJoyce, it is obvious that facts that do not provide reasons for\neveryone are, ipso facto, not moral facts. But it is\ncontroversial whether any of our concepts have commitments that are\nnon-negotiable in this way (cf. Prinzing 2017). \n\nThe second way to respond to the Normativity Objection is to say\nthat moral facts are both natural and normative, in virtue of the fact\nthat normativity itself is a natural phenomenon. This suggestion might\nalso have a feel of absurdity to it. How could normativity be natural?\nThe most popular strategy for substantiating natural normativity is a\ntwo-step strategy. First, show that all normative concepts can be\nanalyzed in terms of one, fundamental normative concept. Second, show\nthat that fundamental normative concept picks out a natural property.\nThere are a number of ways that such an account could proceed: here are\ntwo recent, influential examples: \n\nThis two-step strategy is popular and promising, but it is certainly\nnot uncontroversial. Those moved by the Open Question Argument and the\nNormativity Objection are skeptical that the second step of the\nnaturalizing strategy could ever be completed. Non-naturalists doubt\nthat it could ever be shown that the fundamental normative concept\npicks out some natural property because normative properties and\nnatural properties just seem to obviously be different kinds of\nproperties. Wittgenstein claimed to “see clearly, as it were in a\nflash of light, not only that no description that I can think of would\ndo to describe what I mean by absolute value, but that I would reject\nevery significant description that anybody could possibly suggest,\nab initio, on the ground of its significance”\n(Wittgenstein 1965). David Enoch (2011) is more pithy, saying simply\nthat natural properties and normative properties are just too\ndifferent for any natural account of a fundamental normative\nproperty to be satisfying. \n\nBut while many have felt the force of this “just too\ndifferent” intuition, it’s unclear what that charge amounts to.\nIn what sense are the natural and the normative “just too\ndifferent?” Schroeder thinks that the “too different”\nintuition has force only if there is “a perfectly general single\ntruth about which any reductive view would be forced into\nerror” (Schroeder 2005, 14). The existence of such a truth would\nbe the proof that the natural and normative are just too different;\nwithout such a truth, the non-naturalist hasn’t offered much by way of\nan argument against naturalism. But because all normative\nclaims conceptually reduce to claims about reasons, argues\nSchroeder, there will be no such general truth, provided that we have a\ncoherent account of the foundational notion of a reason. If all\nnormative claims are conceptually reducible to claims about\nreasons, then a coherent account of reasons can explain all\nnormative claims, without error. These fundamental normative facts\nabout reasons are themselves explained by the natural facts to which\nreasons reduce. But because this reduction of reasons will take the\nform of a synthetic reduction, there end up being no\nconceptual connections between the normative and the natural. This\ngeneral lack of conceptual connections between the normative and the\nnatural is what explains the presence of the “just too\ndifferent” intuition, and it is fully compatible with moral\nnaturalism as a synthetic metaphysical truth. \n\nSchroeder’s response may succeed in providing a naturalist-friendly\nexplanation of the “just too different” intuition, but it\nseems strange to say that the existence of numerous analytic relations\nbetween different normative concepts, combined with a lack of analytic\nrelations between normative and natural concepts, should in any way\nwork to support the thesis that the normative is natural. It\nmay well be the case that the lack of conceptual connections between\nthe natural and normative is better explained by non-naturalism (Enoch\n2011). \n\nDerek Parfit’s Triviality Objection (Parfit 2011) is another\ncontemporary extension of the Open Question Argument. If moral\nnaturalism is true, says Parfit, then it will be possible to make moral\nclaims and natural claims and have those two claims be about the same\nfact. Parfit worries that if the two claims are about the same fact,\nthen those two claims must contain all the same information. And a\nstatement of equivalence between any two claims that contain the same\ninformation must be trivial. But moral claims that describe the\nrelationships between moral facts and natural facts are not trivial at\nall—they are highly substantive. \n\nAlthough Parfit’s focus on the nature of normative facts helps to\nilluminate exactly what is supposed to be deficient about the\nnaturalist’s account, it is not clear that this Triviality Objection is\nany more forceful than the Open Question Argument. Parfit’s central\nmotivating thoughts are that (a) natural-moral identity claims are\nsubstantive rather than trivial, and therefore (b) moral claims contain\ndifferent information than natural claims do, which makes it plausible\nthat (c) moral claims concern a different kind of fact. These are\nexactly the central thoughts behind Moore’s Open Question Argument, and\nso we can expect naturalists to respond to this objection in largely\nthe same way that they respond to the Open Question Argument. And,\nindeed, this is what we find. Naturalists have typically responded to\nthe Triviality Objection by saying that moral-natural identities\ncontain additional information in virtue of the fact that they tell us\nsomething about the nature of the moral facts in question. Thus,\nmoral-natural identities are informative in the same way that other\nnatural identity claims (like water = H\\(_2\\)O) are (Copp 2017). \n\nThe last objection to moral naturalism that we will consider is the\nMotivation Objection. This objection is a favorite of metaethical\nexpressivists, and they deploy it with equal fervor against all moral\nrealists, both naturalists and non-naturalists alike. But it is still\nworthy of discussion as a major objection to naturalist moral realism,\nbecause naturalism is the realist view that seems to have the most\nproblem answering the objection. \n\nAccording to a view known as judgement internalism, you\ncan’t make a moral judgement and not be at least somewhat\nmotivated to act in accordance with it. If I sincerely judge that I\nought to give money to charity, then it seems that I must be at least\nsomewhat motivated to give when the opportunity arises. Someone who\nlacks any inclination to give to charity does not really\njudge that they ought to give to charity. \n\nJudgement internalism is a plausible view, and, if it is true, that\nspells trouble for moral naturalists. Plausibly, if a moral judgement\nis just a belief to the effect that some natural fact obtains, I might\nat least conceivably hold that belief and simply not give a damn. In\nwhich case, if naturalism is true, internalism must be false. But many\nphilosophers—particularly expressivists—hold that\njudgement internalism is true. So much the worse for naturalists. \n\nWhat is at stake in the debate between judgement internalists and\ntheir opponents (“externalists”, inevitably) is the\nquestion of whether a certain kind of character is possible: the\namoralist. The amoralist is precisely the sort of person the\ninternalist says is not possible: a character who makes moral judgements\nbut couldn’t care less about them. He features prominently in two\ninfluential defenses of externalism, found in the writings of David\nBrink and Sigrún Svavarsdóttir (Brink 1986; Brink 1989,\nchapter 3, section 3; Svavarsdóttir 1999, 2006). Both offer up\ndescriptions of people of just this kind urging that they are eminently\ncredible and all too intelligible. \n\nInternalists deny that it is possible for anyone to be a genuine\namoralist. While someone might appear to be making moral\njudgements they do not care about, such a person is in fact not making\ngenuine moral judgements at all, according to the internalist.\nRather they are making what R. M. Hare called inverted commas moral\njudgements (1952, 124–126, 163–165). \n\nThe internalist claims that in the mouth of the amoralist, a moral\nutterance fails to mean quite what it does when it is used by you or\nme. What is missing is some action-guiding motivation-entailing\ndimension of meaning that naturalism seems ill-suited to capture. This\nis disputed by externalists such as Brink and Svavarsdóttir,\nwho deny that there is any such dimension to capture. However, a more\nsubtle alternative view (Copp 2001; cf. Barker 2000) might deny that\nany such dimension was part of the “standard core meaning”\n(Copp 2001, 18) of moral terms, but admit its presence as\nsomething implicated, not entailed, by moral\nutterances. Because this dimension is merely implicated, the\namoralist’s “Killing people is wrong but I couldn’t\ncare less”, which cancels the implicature, may be somehow\nsurprising and inappropriate, but it may nonetheless express a\ncoherent, meaningful thought. \n\nThis move might promise to account for much of the intuitive appeal of\ninternalism while remaining fundamentally naturalistic. That would\nleave in place worries about the intelligibility of a possible\ndisconnection between thought about what is right, etc., and thought\nabout what to do. These, however, might recede as the naturalist puts\nflesh on his account of moral properties. Thus, on Copp’s own\nview, the truth conditions of moral concepts are determined, roughly,\nby facts about which moral standards are such that their currency\nwould best conduce to meeting society’s needs (Copp 2001,\n28–29, recapitulating Copp 1995). Certainly, you and I might\nconceivably disagree about that while nonetheless coinciding\nin all our motivations. At which point the issue is going to turn on\nwhether that sort of disagreement is really properly to be\nconsidered moral disagreement at all. \n\nIn this final section, we will examine three leading versions of moral\nnaturalism in detail. \n\nOne important school of thought here is represented by philosophers\nwhose work is inspired by that of Aristotle. This view has its roots\nin the writings of G. E. M. Anscombe, P. T. Geach, and the early\nPhilippa Foot, among others. Its contemporary representatives include\nPhilippa Foot (2001), Rosalind Hursthouse (1999), Martha Nussbaum\n(1995), and Judith Jarvis Thomson (1996, 1997, 2001, 2008). As this\nlist makes clear, this is very much the official metaethical theory\namong many important contemporary virtue ethicists. \n\nAccording to (neo-)Aristotelian virtue ethics, the primary moral\nconcept is that of virtue. Virtue is a property of people; virtuous people are good people. So what does it take for\nsomeone to be a good person? Aristotle’s influential\nanswer to that question is that what it takes to be a good thing is for that thing to\nsuccessfully perform its function. And, Aristotle argued, all\nliving things have a proper function, which is determined by their\nnature. Just as hammers and nails have different functions which spring\nfrom the nature of those things, living things have functions that are\nalso determined by their natures. Worker bees are supposed to collect\nhoney—worker bees that do this well are good bees. Venus\nflytraps are supposed to capture flies—those that do this well\nare good flytraps. And humans are good if they pursue their function,\nas dictated by their nature. \n\nA big problem here, it is widely supposed, is the biology.\nAristotelian ethics embraces an essentialist, teleological conception\nof the nature of a species that doesn’t square with modern\nscience. And the prospects for grounding ethics in modern\npost-Darwinian biology seem hopeless: evolutionary biology has very\nlittle (at least of a positive nature) to tell us about metaethics\nexcept insofar as it might be taken to add plausibility to the kind of\nbroad naturalism described at the outset. (Indeed, as noted,\nevolutionary biology may debunk rather than support our moral\nbeliefs.) Nussbaum has sought to respond to claims of this sort that\nhave been ably canvassed in the work of Bernard Williams (Nussbaum\n1995). Williams reads Aristotle as understanding questions about\nhuman nature as “external” scientific questions to be\naddressed independently of any ethical considerations. This, Nussbaum\ncharges, is a mistake: an external understanding of human nature would\nindeed tell us little about ethics. Aristotle’s understanding of\nbiology and indeed science generally is what she calls\n“internal”, and as such are pervasively informed by\nsubstantive ethical understandings. But to understand ethical facts as\ngrounded in facts about human nature, where the facts about human\nnature are understood in a way that is already pervasively and\nsubstantively moralized, no longer looks much like a form of\nnaturalism, and appears quite consistent with a variety of competing\nmetaethical views such as constructivism, expressivism, or\nnon-naturalism. \n\nNeo-Aristotelian naturalism is articulated at length and along\nmutually similar lines in Foot’s Natural Goodness\n(2001) and Hursthouse’s On Virtue Ethics (1999). We\nwill focus on Hursthouse, whose account is the clearer and more\ndetailed of the two. Ethical naturalism, according to Hursthouse,\nviews evaluation as an activity continuous with a kind of ethology\nthat is focused on the evaluation of living things as specimens of\ntheir kind. In the case of plants, to say that an individual is a good\nmember of whatever its species may be is to evaluate how well its\nparts and operations contribute in ways characteristic of that species\nto the two ends of survival and reproduction. With at least some\nanimals a third end becomes salient—freedom from pain and\npleasure and enjoyment of sorts characteristic to the species in\nquestion. And with social animals a fourth dimension comes into play:\nthe good functioning of the group (Hursthouse 1999, chapter\n9). Evaluation of this kind allows us to say, following Foot, that a\nfree-riding wolf or a dancing bee who finds a source of nectar but\ndoes not alert other bees to it are defective (2001, 96, citing\n“Does Moral Subjectivism Rest on a Mistake?” in Foot\n2002). Defectiveness in this context is a straightforwardly factual\nmatter. Given the normal characteristics of their species, male\ncheetahs who help their heavily pregnant mates to hunt for food are to\nbe classed as defective, as are male polar bears who nurture their\nyoung (Hursthouse 1999, 220–221). \n\nGiven such examples, a critic may urge that it’s hard to see how we\nare here concerned here with evaluation as opposed simply to a\nkind of classification. But Hursthouse demurs. A good human\nbeing is a human being endowed with characteristics that conduce in\ncharacteristically human ways to the four ends of survival,\nreproduction, characteristic enjoyment and freedom from pain, and the\ngood functioning of the group. And, at the level of character, those\ncharacteristics are just the virtues. But humans are special, as a\nhighly salient characteristic feature of human beings is\nrationality. This makes the evaluation of human conduct very\ndifferent from that of cheetahs or polar bears. Being rational, we can\nelect to assign some feature of our characteristic behavior no\nnormative weight at all, or even negative weight. There nonetheless\nremains a distinctive and characteristically human way of carrying on:\nthe rational way, which we characteristically regard as good and take\nourselves to have reason to pursue (Hursthouse, esp.\n221–222). \n\nOnce this is said, it might be objected that we’ve more or less left\nthe naturalism behind. We don’t need anything remotely like ethology to\ntell us that we should favor ethical views supported by good reasons\nover those not so supported. Nor do we need to be any sort of\nnaturalists to believe it. And if we’re concerned with what is\ndistinctively and characteristically human, we might legitimately\nfollow Williams in asking why we should make such a big deal about\nrationality. Why not the making of fire, having sexual intercourse\nwithout regard to season, despoiling the environment and upsetting the\nbalance of nature, or killing things for fun (Williams 1972, 73)?\nThere’s a natural and obvious answer to this, which appeals to widely\nshared human commonalities of value. Perhaps we can bring this too\nunder the heading of the characteristically human, but those humans who\nmay not share these values might fairly retort, So what?\nAren’t they free, for all this quasi-ethological picture tells us, to\nassign normative weights in their own ways? The hallmark feature that\nis distinctive of naturalism, Hursthouse would respond, is the\nregulatory role of the four ends (Hursthouse 1999, 224–226). But\nthese too seem to be decidedly up for grabs, as when she acknowledges\nthat nothing in particular need follow from her view about the ethical\nstatus of (e.g.) celibacy and homosexual sex (Hursthouse 1999,\n215). \n\nWe turn now to the views of Judith Jarvis Thomson. Thomson follows\nGeach in her rejection of the view (which she associates in particular\nwith Moore) that “goodness” names a property of good\nthings, which are accordingly susceptible to more or less unrestricted\nranking by the “betterness” relation. “Good”,\nGeach insists, is an attributive, not a predicative adjective (Geach\n1956). To illustrate briefly: “brown” is predicative, as\n“Hector is a brown mouse” is analysed straightforwardly as\n“Hector is a mouse and he is brown;” the claims\n“Hector is a brown mouse” and “Hector is an\nanimal” entail “Hector is a brown animal.”\n“Enormous”, on the other hand, is attributive, as\n“Hector is an enormous mouse” is not analyzed as\n“Hector is a mouse and he is enormous.” An enormous mouse\nmay still be quite a tiny mammal. This has the effect of neutralizing\nthe Open Question Argument. If there’s no such thing as\ngoodness, but only goodness of a kind, then of course\nwe won’t be able to give an analysis of goodness. \n\nThomson’s account of goodness makes most sense if we consider it\nthrough the lens of the concept of a ‘good toaster.’ A toaster is a\nfunctional kind of thing; for something to be a toaster is for\nit to toast things. And, for something to be a good toaster,\nit must be something that toasts things well. The goodness of\na good toaster is not mysterious in any way. It is entirely a matter of\nthe toaster being composed and organized in such a way as to\nefficiently and effectively perform its characteristic function. And if\nyou have no objection to the idea that some toasters are good and\nothers are bad, then you should have no objection to the idea that\nother things can be good or bad as well. \n\nThere is such a property as being a good \\(K\\) only if \\(K\\) is a\ngoodness-fixing kind (Thomson 2008, 21). For instance,\n“knife” is a goodness-fixing kind; thus, there is the\nproperty of being a good knife. Goodness need\nnot always be understood in terms of a particular substantive. Things\ncan be good in other respects, as we see from examples such as\n“good for use in making cheesecake” or “good for\nAlfred” (Thomson 1997, 278). Thomson calls things that are good\nin this way “good-modified.” Recognizing ways in which\nthings can be good-modified allows us to evaluate things that we might\nnot otherwise be able to evaluate. There is no such thing as “a\ngood smudge”, full stop, because smudges have no characteristic\nfunctions or correctness standards. “Smudge”, according to\nThomson, is not a goodness-fixing kind in the way “knife”\nis. But there might be a smudge that is good for using in a Rorschach\ntest, because “being used in a Rorschach test” is a\nway that smudges can be good-modified. So that is a way that a smudge can be good\n(Thomson 2008, 21–22). \n\nThomson also argues that we can relativize our notion of goodness to a\nclass of things. One can be a good piano player for a six-year old\nwithout being a good piano-player, full stop. And this\nclass-relativization can occur whether we are talking about good\ninstances of kinds or good-modified things. Thus, we can have a good\ntypewriter (for a typewriter built in 1900), or an individual who is\ngood at crossword puzzles (for an athlete). \n\nThomson, following the two-step strategy outlined in Section 2.2,\nholds that goodness is the most fundamental normative concept, and\nthat we can define different normative concepts in terms of\ngoodness. For instance, “for \\(F\\) to be a virtue in a [kind] \\(K\\)\nis for it to be the case that (i) \\(K\\) is a goodness-fixing kind, and\n(ii) a \\(K\\) is as good a \\(K\\) as a \\(K\\) can be only if it has \\(F\\),\nand (iii) it is possible for there to be a \\(K\\) that lacks \\(F\\), and\n(iv) it is not nomologically impossible for there to be a \\(K\\) that\nhas \\(F\\)” (Thomson 2008, 85). Thomson also defines notions of\n“better”, “correct”, “ought”,\n“reason”, and “defective” in terms of goodness\n(Thomson 2008). \n\nWith an account of virtue in hand, we can now begin to define moral\nterms. Thomson is a virtue theorist: to be moral is to be\nvirtuous. For Thomson, it makes no sense to ask whether an act is\nmorally good or not, because “act”, like\n“smudge”, is not a goodness-fixing kind. Accordingly, acts\nare only the kinds of things that can be good-modified. Just as there\nis no such thing as a good smudge, but only smudges that are\ngood in some respect (e.g., for use in Rorschach tests),\nthere is no such thing as a good act, but only acts are\ngood in some respect—e.g., a moral respect. Acts are\nmorally good when they spring from an agent’s\nmorally virtuous traits. And a trait is a moral\nvirtue when a \\(K\\) is as morally good as a \\(K\\) can be only if\nit has that trait (and it’s possible for \\(K\\) to either have or lack that\nvirtue) (Thomson 2008, 79). \n\nMoral goodness is itself explained in terms of moral virtue\nand vice concepts. There is no such thing as being morally good, full\nstop, but only morally good-in-a-way; by being brave, generous, just,\nprudent, etc. To have a moral virtue is a way of being good, but it is\na “second-order” way of being good, because moral goodness\nis defined in terms of other kinds of goodness. (Thomson 1996, 144–147;\n1997, 279–281; 2001, 59–67). As the examples of the good\ntoaster and the good knife illustrate, for Thomson the morally good is\njust one sub-class of good things (and it is not a particularly large\nsub-class; the non-morally good is vastly larger than the morally\ngood). In addition to the morally good, there are four other\nsub-classes of goodness: the useful (as in “good for”\ngoverning a verb), the skilful (“good at”), the enjoyable,\nand the beneficial (as in “good for” governing a noun)\n(Thomson 1996, 131–133). In general, Thomson suggests, a virtue\nis a trait such that, whatever else is true of those among whom we\nlive, it is better if they have it (Thomson 1997, 282). For example,\ngenerosity is a moral virtue because generous people will act in ways\nthat are beneficial for others. \n\nAll five kinds of goodness are natural properties. Being good for\nuse in \\(\\phi\\)-ing is a matter of being such as to facilitate \\(\\phi\\)-ing\nin a way conducive to the wants that people typically seek to satisfy\nwhen \\(\\phi\\)-ing. Being good at \\(\\phi\\)-ing is a matter of being capable of\n\\(\\phi\\)-ing in the way that people who want to \\(\\phi\\) typically want to\n\\(\\phi\\) (Thomson 1996, 134–137). Thomson acknowledges that\nenjoyment is a little tricky: some people enjoy what is not good\n(example: Koolaid ), so a role must be given to expertise, which can be\nhard to characterize (Thomson 1996, 138–140). The beneficial can\nalso be complicated. It is easy enough to account for with such things\nas carpets. What is good for a carpet is what conduces to its being in\nthe condition that people who want carpets typically want their carpets\nto be in (Thomson 1996, 141). In the case of plants and lower animals,\nwhat is good for them is what conduces to health, and health is\nwhatever conduces to their being in a condition to do what they were\ndesigned by nature to do (Thomson 2001, 56–57). What is good for\na person is the trickiest case. It’s not straightforwardly what\nconduces to health, as something may be good for someone for reasons\nthat have little to do with health (example: going to law school\n[Thomson 2001, 55]). Nor is it a matter of conducing to what one most\nwants (example: I might most want to smoke 60 cigarettes a day [Thomson\n2001, 54]). So she thinks the truth is some form of compromise between\nthe want story and the health story (Thomson 2001, 55–56). And\nmoral goodness is a matter of having character traits that promote\nthese other kinds of goodness (particularly by being beneficial). \n\nThis is a beautifully elegant and straightforward account that makes\na valiant attempt to represent moral claims, and indeed evaluative and\nnormative claims more generally, as straightforward matters of natural\nfact. The main critical concerns that might be raised are liable to\necho points already aired. Thus, our earlier remarks about the role of\nbiology might make us suspicious of Thomson’s explication of health,\nand so of the beneficial, in terms of nature’s designs. And if\nThomson’s account of the beneficial is in jeopardy, then so is her\naccount of moral virtue, since moral virtue is largely a matter of\nacting in ways that are beneficial to oneself and others. \n\nIt is likely true that the property of being a good toaster is\nnothing more than the naturally-respectable property of being useful\nfor toasting. But it remains controversial whether Thomson’s\nnaturalistic account of the goodness of good toasters can be extended\nto provide an adequate account of the goodness of good\npeople. \n\nIf moral naturalism is, generally, the view that moral facts are the\nkinds of facts that can be investigated empirically, in a broadly\nscientific way, then no view captures the spirit of naturalism better\nthan Cornell realism. Cornell realism was developed by in the 1980s by\nBoyd (1988), Brink (1986), Sturgeon (1985), and Railton (1986); the\nview gets its name from the fact that Boyd, Brink, and Sturgeon were\nworking or studying at Cornell University at the time. It is a\ncomprehensive metaethical system, with interrelated linguistic,\nmetaphysical, and epistemological commitments, that is driven by a\ncommitment to mirroring scientific methodology in ethics as closely as\npossible. \n\nIt might seem odd to suggest that we can come to know things about\nmorality by using scientific methodology. Empirical methods are all,\nultimately, grounded in an epistemology of observation. But,\nas Gilbert Harman (1977, Ch. 1) famously argued, it does not seem that\nwe can observe moral facts in anything like the same way that we can\nobserve other kinds of natural facts. It’s rather obvious how we can\nhave empirical knowledge of natural properties such as redness\nor roundness; they are directly observable. But\ngoodness doesn’t seem to be directly observable, and that\nlooks like an important disanalogy between moral properties and natural\nproperties. \n\nThe problem with this thought is that not all natural properties are\ndirectly observable. Some kinds of natural properties are highly\ncomplex, and knowable only through the functional role they occupy.\nConsider, for instance, the property of being healthy. Being\nhealthy isn’t like being red; there’s no way that healthy\npeople look. Of course, there may be some characteristic visual signs\nof healthiness—rosy cheeks, a spring in one’s\nstep—but these visual signs are neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor healthiness. These directly observable properties are\nonly indications of healthiness. Healthiness is a complex\nnatural property, wholly constituted by an organism’s body being\nin the “proper” configuration. Healthiness has a robust\ncausal profile. There are many things that can cause or impede health\nby their presence or absence: food, water, disease, etc. And there are\nmany things that will result from health in typical circumstances:\nenergy, long life, etc. Rosy cheeks and a spring in one’s step\nare indications of healthiness because these are properties that\nare—typically—caused by health. Our awareness of\nthe causal profile of healthiness thus gives us a way of figuring out\nwhich things have or do not have the complex property of\nhealthiness. \n\nThe Cornell realists hold that goodness is exactly like\nhealthiness in all of these ways (Boyd 1988). Like\nhealthiness, goodness is a complex natural property that is not\ndirectly observable, but nonetheless has a robust causal profile. Like\n“healthiness”, “goodness” is not synonymous\nwith any simpler set of more directly observable claims. Instead,\n“goodness” describes the functionally complex natural\nproperty that is the effect of certain characteristic causes, and the\ncause of certain characteristic effects. Many different things\ncontribute to or detract from goodness—things like pleasure or\npain, honesty or untruthfulness—and there are many things that\nwill result from goodness in typical circumstances—things like\nhuman flourishing, or political peace. Because goodness is a natural\nproperty with a complex causal profile, the property of goodness can\nenter into explanatory relations. Thus, contra Harman, it is possible\nfor goodness to explain our observations (Sturgeon 1985). We can,\naccordingly, observe whether something is good by looking for\nindications of goodness. This is exactly the same way that we observe\nwhether something is healthy. \n\nThe great asset of Cornell realism is that it directly adopts widely\naccepted views about the nature of natural properties and scientific\nknowledge in order to answer the foundational questions of moral\nmetaphysics and moral epistemology. What are moral properties? Highly\ncomplex natural properties, individuated by their causal\nprofiles—Boyd calls these homeostatic cluster\nproperties. Are there, generally, properties like this? Yes;\nhealthiness is one; moral properties are properties like\nthat. How do we know about moral properties? By looking for\ndirectly observable properties that are characteristically\nfunctionally upstream or downstream from the moral property that we\nare interested in (provided that we have justified background beliefs\nabout the functional roles of moral properties). Do we, generally,\nhave knowledge like this? Yes; this is how we have scientific\nknowledge; moral knowledge is knowledge like that. In this\nway, the theoretical resources of scientific realism also turn out to\nsupport moral realism (Boyd 1988). \n\nA skeptic might object that it’s impossible to have justified\nbackground beliefs about the functional profile of moral properties.\nBut this kind of objection threatens to prove too much. We are entitled\nto rely on background beliefs in moral theory development because we’re\nentitled to do so in science, generally (Boyd 1988, 189–191). Our\ntheories and background beliefs are justified together by their overall\ncoherence. So if there are no substantial metaphysical or\nepistemological issues raised by the claims that healthiness\nexists and that we can know about healthiness, then there\nshould be no substantial metaphysical or epistemological issues raised\nby the claims that goodness exists and that we can know\nabout goodness. \n\nIt is not essential to Cornell realism that goodness be identified\nwith any particular complex natural property—different Cornell\nrealists have different first-order normative commitments. \n\nThe most influential of these accounts is due to Railton (1986).\nRailton, like Thomson, holds that moral goodness is defined in terms of\nwhat is non-morally good for agents. Whereas Thomson, as a\nneo-Aristotelian, defines what is good for a human in terms of human\nbiology, Railton defines non-moral goodness in terms of the desires of\na fully-informed counterpart (see also Brandt 1979, Smith 1994). To\nillustrate, Railton asks us to imagine a traveler, Lonnie, who feels\nterrible because he is badly dehydrated. Lonnie does not know that he\nis dehydrated, and so is not taking appropriate steps to make himself\nfeel better. But we can imagine a fully-informed version of\nLonnie—Railton names him Lonnie-Plus—who knows about\nhis dehydration and knows that drinking clear liquids will make him\nfeel better. Lonnie-Plus, who (like Lonnie) desires to feel better but\nwho (unlike Lonnie) knows the best means to that end, would choose to\ndrink clear fluids. The fact that Lonnie-Plus would choose to drink\nclear fluids means that drinking clear fluids is good for Lonnie. But\nthis is not a relativist view of morality, because the fact that\nLonnie-Plus would choose to drink clear liquids is determined by\nLonnie’s circumstances and constitution, and facts about\nLonnie’s circumstances and constitution are objective facts. In\ngeneral: the complex natural property of being good for an\nagent is identical to the complex natural property that\nagent’s fully-informed counterpart would choose. This makes\ngoodness “objective, though relational” (Railton 1986,\n167). \n\nThis is an intuitive account of goodness, but it’s certainly not\nuncontroversial. Loeb (1995) argues that we have no way of knowing\nwhat a fully-informed version of ourselves would\ndesire—it’s absurd to think that we have any basis for\nmaking judgements about what we would desire if we knew literally\neverything, since we are so far from being omniscient\nourselves. An omniscient agent’s desires might look nothing like\nour own. Thus, what would satisfy an omniscient agent might well be\nsomething that we would in no way recognize as beneficial. \n\nWe might also worry about the fact that, on Railton’s view, what\nis morally good is grounded in what is non-morally good for agents,\nand what is non-morally good for agents is grounded in those\nagents’ contingent circumstances and constitution. This suggests\nthat moral facts would not provide the same reasons for everyone. As\nwe’ve already seen, Railton accepts this somewhat\ncounter-intuitive conclusion. That’s what makes his account a\n“reforming definition”. \n\nThere may, in practice, be substantial overlap between the\nmetaphysical commitments of neo-Aristotelianism and Cornell realism.\nCornell realists say that the good is a certain higher-order natural\nproperty. Neo-Aristotelians say that goodness has something to do with\nhuman flourishing, which is itself a kind of higher-order natural\nproperty. Both Cornell realists (Boyd) and neo-Aristotelians (Thomson)\nhave found the analogy with healthiness illuminating when\nexplaining the nature of moral properties (see also Bloomfield 2001).\nSo Cornell realists and neo-Aristotelians do tend to be similar in the\nway that they conceive of normative properties. But they differ with\nrespect to what they say about language. \n\nNeo-Aristotelians, such as Thomson, tend to favor an attributive\nsemantics for ‘good.’ To be good is always to be good in a way\nor a good thing of its kind. But because Cornell realists\nregard moral terms as terms for a certain kind of complex natural\nproperty, they accept a causal reference theory for moral\nterms, because a causal reference theory is the standard theory of\nreference for natural kind terms. \n\nAdopting the causal reference theory is a sensible thing for the\nCornell realists to do, for two reasons. First, it continues their\nfoundational commitment to treating moral properties as a kind of\ncausally-individuated natural property. And second, it helps them evade\nthe Open Question Argument (Brink 2001). By accepting a causal theory\nof reference, the Cornell realists thereby reject a description theory\nof reference; for a Cornell realist, moral terms cannot be defined in\nany verbal way. They simply refer to the (complex higher-order natural)\nproperty that causally regulates their use. This makes Cornell realism\na form of synthetic naturalism. As we saw in 1.2, Moore’s Open\nQuestion Argument shows, at most, that analytic naturalism is\nfalse. \n\nBut the Cornell realist’s semantics is also the source of the\nmost influential objection to Cornell realism. According to this\nobjection—Horgan and Timmons’s Moral Twin Earth Objection\n(Horgan and Timmons 1991)—we do not use moral terms in the way\nthat the Cornell realist predicts. \n\nTo understand the Moral Twin Earth Objection, we need to first\nunderstand how causal regulation semantics are supposed to work. The\nfollowing thought experiment, from Putnam (1975), has been highly\ninfluential: Imagine a world—Twin Earth—where there is\nno H\\(_2\\)O, but there is another substance called XYZ. This substance XYZ,\nwhile distinct from H\\(_2\\)O, fills the rivers and lakes, is clear and\ntasteless, etc. XYZ even has the property of being called\n‘water’—when residents of Twin Earth fill up a glass with\nXYZ from the tap, they will say “I have a cup of water.”\nYet for all this, we would not say that Twin Earth is a planet where\nwater is XYZ. We would say that this is a planet where there is no\nwater. There is, instead, another substance—XYZ—that\nplays the same functional role. Yet when the person on Twin Earth fills\na cup from the tap and declares “I have a cup of water”,\nthat assertion seems true. What could account for that? Putnam argues\nthat the word ‘water’ just means something different on Twin Earth than\nit does in the actual world. In the actual world, ‘water’ means H\\(_2\\)O\nbecause, in the actual world, H\\(_2\\)O is that thing that is clear,\ntasteless, fills the rivers and lakes, and is referred to with the\ninscription ‘water.’ But on Twin Earth, ‘water’ means XYZ because, on\nTwin Earth, it is XYZ that is clear, tasteless, fills the rivers\nand lakes, and is referred to with the inscription ‘water.’ Natural\nkind terms like ‘water’ refer to those properties that causally\nregulate the use of those terms. That is why the word ‘water’ literally\nmeans something different on Twin Earth than it does in the real\nworld. \n\nAccording to the Moral Twin Earth Objection, things don’t work this\nway at all for moral terms. \n\nImagine a world—Moral Twin Earth—that is exactly\nlike the actual world, except on Moral Twin Earth, people’s use\nof moral terminology is causally regulated by different properties\nfrom those in the actual world. People use moral terminology to praise\nand blame and to guide action, but they take very different kinds of\nactions to be worthy of praise or blame and they guide their actions\nin very different ways. Thus, if the causal reference theory is true\nfor moral terms, the word ‘right’ literally means\nsomething different on Moral Twin Earth than it does in the real\nworld—this is the common intuition that drives Putnam’s\noriginal Twin Earth case. But we do not have the same judgement about\nhow people use moral language on Moral Twin Earth! If people on Moral\nTwin Earth take different actions to be worthy of praise or blame, we\ndon’t conclude that our words ‘right’ and\n‘wrong’ mean different things. We conclude that\nthere is a substantive moral disagreement between the denizens of\nMoral Twin Earth and the people in our world, and that such\ndisagreement is possible only because we and the Twin Earthers mean\nthe same thing by our moral terms. Horgan and Timmons argue that this\nproves that moral terms like ‘right’ and\n‘wrong’ do not refer to whatever it is that causally\nregulates their use. So much the worse for Cornell realism. (See\nDowell (2016) for a recent, influential criticism of this\nargument). \n\nTo put the point another way: Assume that causal reference theory is\ntrue for moral terms, and assume that different properties causally\nregulate the use of moral terms in different societies. If both of\nthese assumptions are true, it follows that moral terms refer to\ndifferent things in different societies. And it does seem,\nempirically, to be the case that different properties causally\nregulate the use of moral terms in different societies. Thus, if\ncausal reference theory is true, cross-cultural moral disagreement\nshould be impossible. Just as someone on Twin Earth\ndoesn’t have a word in their language to refer to\nwater—they just refer to something else (XYZ) that they call\n‘water’—people in different societies don’t\nhave words for right or wrong—they only have words\nfor something else that they call ‘right’ or\n‘wrong.’ To the extent that this is a counter-intuitive\nimplication, this is a problem for causal reference theory. (It is\nworth noting that some moral relativists have not found this\nimplication to be counter-intuitive at all. Prinz (2007) and Wong\n(2006) have both defended versions of moral relativism that are\ngrounded entirely in the Cornell realists’ empirical\nmethodology.) \n\nOne might think that Cornell realists can respond by offering a new\naccount of moral language. But this response faces severe\ndifficulties, on two fronts. First, the causal reference theory is\nwhat allows Cornell realists to avoid a commitment to analytic\nnaturalism and the accompanying Open Question Argument. If the causal\nreference theory is false of moral terms, the naturalist may be forced\nto accept a description theory of moral semantics. This would re-open\nthe Open Question Argument as an important line of objection to\nnaturalism. \n\nSecond, the causal reference theory for moral language is essential to\nthe Cornell realists’ methodological and epistemological\ncommitments. If moral goodness is the thing that regulates our use\nof moral terminology, then the terms of our empirical\ninvestigation are simple: we just investigate what regulates the use\nof our moral language. But if the moral facts are not (necessarily)\nthe facts that regulate the use of our moral language, then which\nfacts are they? We need an answer to that question before we\ncan proceed with any empirical inquiry into morality. Consider: If,\nfor half of the world’s population, their use of the word\n‘water’ were causally regulated by the odorless tasteless\nstuff that fills rivers and lakes, but, for the other half of the\nworld, ‘water’ were causally regulated by the intoxicating\nliquid found in wine, beer, and liquor, Lavoisier would have had no\nmethodological basis for concluding that water is H\\(_2\\)O (rather\nthan C\\(_2\\)H\\(_6\\)O.) \n\nBecause of this, the Moral Twin Earth objection is often presented as\na kind of extension of Moore’s Open Question Argument. The Open\nQuestion Argument is, in Moore’s formulation, an attack on the\nidea that there can be analytic natural-normative property identity\nclaims. But in a larger sense, the Open Question Argument picks out a\nkind of epistemic shortcoming for moral naturalists. Moral naturalists\nare committed to the idea that moral facts are a kind of natural\nfact—but which natural facts are the moral facts? If\nmoral claims are synonymous with certain natural claims, we\ncan know by conceptual analysis which natural facts are the moral\nfacts. And if moral facts are the facts that causally regulate our use\nof moral terminology, that provides us with another way of\ninvestigating which facts are the moral facts. But if neither of those\nstories are available, it seems that we have no way of\nidentifying which natural facts are the moral ones (Huemer 2005,\nchapter 4; Bedke 2012). This would be a serious methodological\nproblem for moral naturalists, and would also mark a critical\ndisanalogy between moral epistemology and scientific\nepistemology. This disanalogy would be crippling to Cornell realists,\nwho hold that there is no such disanalogy. \n\nFrank Jackson’s Moral Functionalism is the most influential\ncontemporary version of analytic naturalism. (Finlay (2014) endorses\nanother version of analytic naturalism.) Jackson believes that ethical\nproperties are natural properties or, as he prefers to say in this\ncontext, descriptive properties. His argument for this\nappeals to the supervenience of the moral on the descriptive. This is\nthe claim that no two completely specified situations that differ in\ntheir ethical properties can be exactly alike in their descriptive\nproperties. Supervenience entails that no two worlds that are exactly\nlike each other descriptively can differ ethically, which means that\nethical properties and descriptive properties are necessarily\ncoextensive. And Jackson does not believe there are any necessarily\ncoextensive but distinct properties. If two properties not only\ncoincide in the actual world but could not fail to coincide\nwe have, he contends, not two properties but one. Thus, Supervenience\nentails that ethical properties are descriptive. \n\nJackson doesn’t just argue that ethical properties are\ndescriptive properties. He also has an account of which descriptive\nproperties ethical properties are (Jackson 1998, 129–134,\n140–143). It goes as follows. \n\nTo begin with, take some platitudinous thoughts about morality and\nwrite them down in a great big sentence. \n\nFM1. Wrong actions ought to be discouraged\nand shunned; right actions ought to be promoted and encouraged;\nvirtuous people are disposed to perform right actions and not to\nperform wrong actions; vicious people are disposed to perform wrong\nactions and not to perform right actions; right actions are right\nbecause they have certain natural properties on which rightness\nsupervenes; similarly for wrong actions; and so on. \n\nNow let’s transform this as follows: \n\nFM2. Actions with property \\(w\\) stand in\nrelation \\(o\\) to being discouraged and shunned; actions with property\n\\(r\\) stand in relation \\(o\\) to being promoted and encouraged; people\nwith property \\(v_1\\) are disposed to perform actions with \\(r\\) and\nnot to perform actions with \\(w\\); people with property \\(v_2\\) are\ndisposed to perform actions with \\(w\\) and not to perform actions with\n\\(r\\); actions with \\(r\\) have \\(r\\) because they have certain natural\nproperties on which \\(r\\) supervenes; similarly for actions with\n\\(w\\); and so on. \n\nWhat we just did was to take all and only the moral terms in FM1,\nget rid of them, and uniformly replace them with variables. FM2,\nunlike FM1, doesn’t contain any moral terms. But that fact\nis not yet very interesting, as FM2 isn’t really a\nmeaningful sentence. But we can turn it into one by simply doing\nthis: \n\nFM3. There exists a property \\(w\\) and a\nproperty \\(r\\) and a property \\(v_1\\) and a property \\(v_2\\) and a\nrelation \\(o\\) (and whatever further properties and relations are\ndesignated by the variables in a complete statement of FM2) such that:\nactions with \\(w\\) stand in \\(o\\) to being discouraged and shunned;\nactions with property \\(r\\) stand in \\(o\\) to being promoted and\nencouraged; people with \\(v_1\\) are disposed to perform actions with\n\\(r\\) and not to perform actions with \\(w\\); people with \\(v_2\\) are\ndisposed to perform actions with \\(w\\) and not to perform actions with\n\\(r\\); actions with \\(r\\) have \\(r\\) because they have certain natural\nproperties on which \\(r\\) supervenes; similarly for actions with\n\\(w\\); and so on. \n\n(Sentences like this that result from performing this sort of maneuver\nare called Ramsey sentences.) Now notice something about\nFM3. Unlike FM2, it is a meaningful if not very pretty\nsentence. But unlike FM1, it is a sentence you would be able to\nunderstand without possessing any moral concepts. All you need to do\nis understand all the nonmoral, descriptive concepts in FM3 and\nfollow its rather complicated structure. \n\nWhat FM3 says is that there are a bunch of things \\(w, r, v_1\\)\netc. that together play the complex roles FM3 specifies in the\ncomplex structure FM3 describes. This isn’t yet quite\nwhat’s wanted. What we want is a sentence that says\nthere’s exactly one bunch of such things. Logicians\nhave a standard trick for doing this. This calls for a decidedly\ncomplicated sentence that goes like this: \nFM4. There exists a property \\(w\\) and a\nproperty \\(r\\) and a property \\(v_1\\) and a property \\(v_2\\) and a\nrelation \\(o\\) (etc.) such that: actions with \\(w\\) stand in \\(o\\) to\nbeing discouraged and shunned; actions with property \\(r\\) stand in\n\\(o\\) to being promoted and encouraged; people with \\(v_1\\) are\ndisposed to perform actions with \\(r\\) and not to perform actions with\n\\(w\\); people with \\(v_2\\) are disposed to perform actions with \\(w\\)\nand not to perform actions with \\(r\\); actions with \\(r\\) have \\(r\\)\nbecause they have certain natural properties on which \\(r\\)\nsupervenes; similarly for actions with \\(w\\); and so on; \n\nAND \n\nfor all \\(w^*\\) and all \\(r^*\\) and all \\(v_1^*\\) and all \\(v_2^*\\)\nand all \\(o^*\\) (etc.): actions with \\(w^*\\) stand in \\(o^*\\) to being\ndiscouraged and shunned; actions with property \\(r^*\\) stand in\n\\(o^*\\) to being promoted and encouraged; people with \\(v_1^*\\) are\ndisposed to perform actions with \\(r\\) and not to perform actions with\n\\(w^*\\); people with \\(v_2^*\\) are disposed to perform actions with\n\\(w\\) and not to perform actions with \\(r^*\\); actions with \\(r^*\\)\nhave \\(r^*\\) because they have certain natural properties on which\n\\(r\\) supervenes; similarly for actions with \\(w^*\\); and so on IF AND\nONLY IF \\(w^* = w\\) and \\(r^* = r\\) and \\(v_1^* = v_1\\) and \\(v_2^* =\nv_2\\) and \\(o^* = o\\) (etc.). \n\nNow suppose FM4 is true. Now we can do something neat: we can\ndefine ethical terms in pristinely natural terms. Here’s\nhow. Let’s take “right.” “Right” is what\nwe replaced with the variable “\\(r\\)”. So we can just\nsay: \n\nRIGHT. Rightness is the property \\(r\\) such that: There\nexists a property \\(w\\) and a property \\(v_1\\) and a property \\(v_2\\)\nand a relation \\(o\\) (etc.) such that: actions with \\(w\\) stand in\n\\(o\\) to being discouraged and shunned; actions with property \\(r\\)\nstand in \\(o\\) to being promoted and encouraged; people with \\(v_1\\)\nare disposed to perform actions with \\(r\\) and not to perform actions\nwith \\(w\\); people with \\(v_2\\) are disposed to perform actions with\n\\(w\\) and not to perform actions with \\(r\\); actions with \\(r\\) have\n\\(r\\) because they have certain natural properties on which \\(r\\)\nsupervenes; similarly for actions with \\(w\\); and so on; AND …\n(Uniqueness clause as for FM4). \n\nThis is neat because it allows us to offer reductive definitions of\nmoral concepts in spite of their highly holistic character. The fact\nthat moral concepts can all be defined in terms of one another might\nmake it seem prohibitively difficult to try to offer reductive\ndefinitions of these concepts one by one. But by considering all moral\nconcepts together and offering reductive definitions of\nnetworks of moral concepts, this difficulty can, perhaps, be\novercome. \n\nBut is FM4 true? Well, it depends how much structure we\noffer. It depends, that is, on how rich and determinate its full\ncontent is. And how rich is it? Well, we may in the first instance\nthink of the “platitudinous thoughts” we put into it as\ngiving the content of what Jackson calls “folk morality”\n(Jackson 1998, 130): \n\nThe network of moral opinions, intuitions, principles, and concepts\nwhose mastery is part and parcel of having a sense of what is right\nand wrong and of being able to engage in meaningful debate about what\nought to be done. \n\nThe trouble is that folk morality is pervasively contested. There’s\na lot of agreement, to be sure: we’d all be talking past each other\nwere there not (Jackson 1998, 132). But what’s left when you leave the\ncontested stuff out plausibly won’t furnish enough determinate content\nto make the uniqueness clause we added at FM3 come out true.\nSo what Jackson proposes is that, instead of taking the input to this\nanalytic procedure to be folk morality in its current state, we should\ntake it to be what he calls “mature folk morality”, where\nthis designates what folk morality will have evolved into when critical\nreflection has done all it can to sharpen it up. \n\nWe can then see how it may be possible to offer definitions in\ndescriptive terms of moral concepts. Our moral concepts serve to pick\nout the properties that occupy the various roles in the network of such\nroles specified by a suitable ramsification of mature folk morality.\nAnd the properties that occupy these roles will be descriptive\nproperties, Jackson believes, in the light of the argument aired above.\nThus, moral terms pick out descriptive properties. \n\nJackson seeks to describe a reductive analysis of ethical terms that\nunderstands them as picking out the properties that play a certain\nrole in the conceptual network determined by mature folk\nmorality. The most worrying difficulty with Jackson’s approach\nis that this looks unpromising as a reductive analysis, as\nthere is a term in it that appears decidedly evaluative in character:\n“mature” (Yablo 2000). “Mature” had better not\napply to any old terminal point our ethical development may happen to\ntake us to, but only to a terminus we could arrive at by good,\nreasonable ethical discussion and argument. One possible answer in the\nspirit of the wider theory might be to say that “mature”\npicks out whatever plays the “mature” role in mature folk\nmorality. But that seems circular. After all, maturity in current folk\nmorality is plausibly pretty contested. There are many ways morality\ncould develop to a more settled state, and we are liable to differ\nabout which of them we count as maturation and which we would describe\nless favorably. So a naturalistic account of ‘maturity’\nfails to pick out one set of platitudes as being the unique platitudes\nof mature folk morality. And if we attempt to narrow down the range of\nsets of platitudes that might count as “mature folk\nmorality” by attempting to specify the\nbest candidate for mature folk morality, a central question\nseems to be getting begged. Or, as we might say, echoing Moore, left\nopen.","contact.mail":"mattlutz326@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
