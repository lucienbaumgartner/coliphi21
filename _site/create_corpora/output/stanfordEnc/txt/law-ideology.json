Ideology refers, in a general sense, to a system\nof political ideas, and law and politics seem inextricably intertwined.\nJust as ideologies are dotted across the political spectrum, so too are\nlegal systems. Thus we speak of both legal systems and ideologies as\nliberal, fascist, communist, and so on, and most people probably assume\nthat a law is the legal expression of a political ideology. One would\nexpect the practice and activity of law to be shaped by people’s\npolitical beliefs, so law might seem to emanate from ideology in a\nstraightforward and uncontroversial way.\n\n\n\nHowever, the connection between law and ideology is both complex and\ncontentious. This is because of the diversity of definitions of\nideology, and the various ways in which ideology might be related to\nlaw. Moreover, whilst the observation about law’s link with ideology\nmight seem a sociological commonplace, the link between law and\nideology is more often made in a critical spirit, in order to impugn\nlaw.\n\n\n\nAt issue is an understanding of ideology as a source of\nmanipulation. Law as ideology directs its subjects in ways that are not\ntransparent to the subjects themselves; law, on this view, cloaks\npower. The ideal of law, in contrast, involves a set of institutions\nthat regulate or restrain power with reference to norms of justice.\nThus the presence of the ideological in law must, in some sense,\ncompromise law’s integrity. Not only is the view of law as ideology at\nodds with a lot of mainstream thinking about law, it seems difficult to\nreconcile with the central philosophical positions on the nature of\nlaw, e.g. a positivist conception of law as a set of formal rules, or a\nnatural law conception where law is identified with moral\nprinciples.\n\n\n\nWhat is ideology? The term was likely coined by the French thinker\nClaude Destutt de Tracy at the turn of the nineteenth century, in his\nstudy of the Enlightenment. For De Tracy, ideology was the science of\nideas and their origins. Ideology understands ideas to issue, not\nhaphazardly from mind or consciousness, but as the result of forces in\nthe material environment that shape what people think. De Tracy\nbelieved his view of ideology could be put to progressive political\npurposes, since understanding the source of ideas might enable efforts\non behalf of human progress (see Steger 2007, 24–32). \n\nIdeology today is generally taken to mean not a science of ideas,\nbut the ideas themselves, and moreover ideas of a particular kind.\nIdeologies are ideas whose purpose is not epistemic, but political.\nThus an ideology exists to confirm a certain political viewpoint, serve\nthe interests of certain people, or to perform a functional role in\nrelation to social, economic, political and legal institutions. Daniel\nBell (1960) dubbed ideology ‘an action-oriented system of\nbeliefs,’ and the fact that ideology is action-oriented indicates\nits role is not to render reality transparent, but to motivate people\nto do or not do certain things. Such a role may involve a process of\njustification that requires the obfuscation of reality. Nonetheless,\nBell and other liberal sociologists do not assume any particular\nrelation between ideology and the status quo; some ideologies serve the\nstatus quo, others call for its reform or overthrow. \n\nOn this view, ideology can shape law, but a variety of ideologies\nmight be vying for legal mastery; there is no necessary connection\nbetween law and a particular ideology. Law need not be understood as\ncompromised, since law being ideological might just refer to the\ninstitutions of popular sovereignty, where public policy reflects\ncitizens’ principles and beliefs; ideology would in that case just be a\nshorthand way of referring to the views of citizens that are\nlegitimately instantiated in the laws of the land. Nonetheless, Bell\nargued that a postwar consensus on capitalism and liberal democracy\nmight spell the ‘end of ideology.’ \n\nA more critical understanding of law’s relation to ideology, and the\nrole and purposes that ideology serves, is found in the writings of\nKarl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Like De Tracy, Marx and Engels contend\nthat ideas are shaped by the material world, but as historical\nmaterialists they understand the material to consist of relations of\nproduction that undergo change and development. Moreover, for Marx and\nEngels, it is the exploitative and alienating features of capitalist\neconomic relations that prompt ideas they dub ‘ideology.’\nIdeology only arises where there are social conditions such as those\nproduced by private property that are vulnerable to criticism and\nprotest; ideology exists to protect these social conditions from attack\nby those who are disadvantaged by them. Capitalist ideologies give an\ninverted explanation for market relations, for example, so that human\nbeings perceive their actions as the consequence of economic factors,\nrather than the other way around, and moreover, thereby understand the\nmarket to be natural and inevitable. Members of the Frankfurt School\nsuch as Jürgen Habermas drew on the Marxist idea of ideology as a\ndistortion of reality to point to its role in communication, wherein\ninterlocutors find that power relations prevent the open, uncoerced\narticulation of beliefs and values. \n\nThus ideology, far from being a science, as De Tracy contends, or\nany set of action-oriented beliefs as Bell puts it, is rather\ninherently conservative, quietist, and epistemically unreliable.\nIdeology conserves by camouflaging flawed social conditions, giving an\nillusory account of their rationale or function, in order to legitimate\nand win acceptance of them. Indeed, on this view of the ideological\nrole of law, in a just society there would be no need for a mystifying\naccount of reality, and thus no need for law. The concept of law as\nideology is thus central to the Marxist view that law will wither away\nwith the full flowering of communism (Sypnowich 1990, ch. 1). \n\nThe negative view of ideology taken by Marxists might suggest a crude\nconception where legal ideology is a tool cynically wielded by the\npowerful to ensure submission by the powerless. However, it offends\nthe “conception of right,” if “a code of law is the\nblunt, unmitigated, unadulterated expression of the domination of a\nclass” (Engels, letter to C. Schmidt, October 27, 1890). And\nbecause ideology such as law takes a formal and normative form, the\npowerful are in its grips too, persuaded by an account of the\ninevitable and just order from which they profit.  Moreover, ideology\nis no mere fiction; it is produced by real social conditions and\nreflects them. Ideology thus must succeed in constituting a consensus\nabout capitalism, and it must do so by giving expression to\ncapitalism’s recognizable features. Equality before the law, for\nexample, is both elicited by, and reflects, the reality of capitalist\neconomic relations, even if it is an equality that is formal and\nincomplete. Consent will not be forthcoming if legal ideology bears no\nrelation whatsoever to the social conditions it seeks to justify.  The\nidea that ideology inverts reality is important here. In his camera\nobscura metaphor in The German Ideology, Marx contends that\nreality appears upside down in ideology, much like the photographic\nprocess provides an inverted image. The inverted image is telling; it\nis a recognisable depiction of reality, even if it is at the same time\na distorted one ((Marx and Engels [TGI], 25). Karl Mannheim (1936)\nelaborated further on the idea of the complex relation between reality\nand ideology by pointing to the human need for ideology. Ideologies\nare neither true nor false but are a set of socially conditioned ideas\nthat provide a truth that people, both the advantaged and the\ndisadvantaged, want to hear. \n\nIn the 1920s, American jurisprudence came under the influence of\nanother version of the critical view of ideology and law. The school of\nlegal realism abandoned Marx’s specifically historical materialist\nexplanation, but took up the idea that social forces outside the law\nare central in determining what the law is (see Cohen 1935, 818–21). Realists opposed\ntraditional ‘formalist’ accounts of adjudication, where\njudges are understood to rely on uniquely and distinctively legal\nmaterials in rendering their judgments. Instead, the realists contended\nthat law is inherently indeterminate, and thus judicial decisions must\nbe explained by factors outside the law. Ideology emerges as one kind\nof realist explanation, where judicial decisions are the effect of\npolitical ideas, be they of the judge, the legal profession more\ngenerally, societal elites, or majority public opinion. The realists\naligned their critique of law with a progressive politics. The\ninevitable influence of factors external to the law meant that social\nand political changes augured by the emerging welfare state were no\nthreat to the purity of law. Indeed, the expanding regulative power of\nthe administrative state would make it more likely that the influences\non the law were now those of popular sovereignty and social justice,\nrather than the more nefarious influences of the past. \n\nThe view that law is a reflection of ideology was taken up again in\nthe 1970s and 80s, with the emergence of the Critical Legal Studies\nmovement. Critical Legal Studies was a radical school of thought\nshaped by a number of influences: the Marxist and realist traditions;\nthe philosophical perspective of ‘deconstruction;’ and the\npolitics of issues such as feminism, environmentalism and anti-racism.\nThe movement takes up the realist idea that law is fundamentally\nindeterminate, and echoes Marxist views about how the interests of the\npowerful shape law. Exponents offer some astute observations about the\nways in which law is taught and practiced in order to give the\nmisleading impression of law’s certainty and legitimacy. Particular\nlegal doctrines are targeted for papering over the inconsistent and\narbitrary features of legal decision-making; the rule of law, for\nexample, is criticized for a naïve view of the form of law as\nunaffected by law’s content and the social context in which law\noperates. The indeterminacy of law can produce a variety of results;\nDuncan Kennedy, for example, points out the surprising ways in which\nthe ideology of formal legal reasoning can remedy injustice, even if\nideology often disables such remedies as well (Kennedy 1976). Thus the ideology view\ncan now be taken to reflect a consensus among radicals of all stripes\non the role of law as a dissembling force to safeguard the unjust\nrelations of the status quo. \n\nThe well-known debate about the sources of law appears to be radically\nundercut by a view of law as ideology. The sources debate has usually\nbeen posed in terms of the extent to which morality is intrinsic to\nthe definition of law. Natural lawyers argue that what is law must\npartly depend on moral criteria. Following Thomas Aquinas, the\ntraditional criteria have not strayed far from the teachings of the\nRoman Catholic Church, but more recent natural law arguments, such as\nthose of Lon Fuller and Ronald Dworkin, have proffered secular\nstandards emanating from the procedural ideals of the rule of law or\nthe constitutionalism of American liberalism. All natural lawyers,\nhowever, are agreed that what the law is must be determined, in some\nsense, by what the law ought to be. \n\nPositivists, in contrast, have argued that what is law is determined\nonly by the institutional facts internal to a legal system, facts that\nmay or may not meet moral standards. Early positivists, such as Thomas\nHobbes and John Austin, argued that even the legitimacy of law did not\ndepend on moral criteria; law must be obeyed, however much it falls\nshort of moral ideals. More recent exponents, such as H.L.A. Hart and\nJoseph Raz, have argued that legal positivism is committed only to the\nidea that because what is law is a factual question, law’s legitimacy\ncan be determined by moral criteria outside the law that might\nrecommend disobedience. All positivists, however, are agreed that,\nalthough law may meet moral criteria, what the law is and what it\nought to be should be kept distinct. \n\nThe natural law and legal positivist positions are united, however, in\nthe aim to provide a concept of the essence of law. This endeavour\nsupplies them with a common enemy in the view of law as ideology,\nwhich finds trying to determine the essence of law as fundamentally\nmisconceived. After all, if law is inevitably shaped by ideas\nemanating from power relations outside of the law, then it would seem\nthat law has no essence, be it moral or institutional. If law is\nreduced to ideology, or seen as its mere effect, then legality looks\ncontingent and unprincipled, having no necessary content or\ndefinition, no intrinsic character. If law both mirrors and distorts\nthe realities of power, it is power, not principles of legality, which\ntells us what law is. Thus for most mainstream legal theorists, the\nideological is no necessary feature of the law, and law should\ncertainly not be defined according to the radical conception where\nintrinsic to law is a mystification of reality, or an obfuscation of\nsocial relations in order to exact compliance. \n\nThe picture is more complicated, however. The Marxist view of law as\nideology does, after all, have some affinities with rival views on the\nsources of law. The Marxist view concedes to the positivist, for\nexample, that law emerges from the practices of society, though the\npractices are extra-legal – political, economic and social – rather\nthan the practices of institutional facts internal to a legal\nsystem. Social forces are ultimately determining of the content and\nform of a legal system. Indeed, the Marxist Louis Althusser’s idea of\nideological state apparatuses (Althusser 1971) has a positivist flavour in its\ninsistence that political reality can be exhaustively described by\nreference to structures rather than norm-bearing agents. We might\nexpect that the radical exponent of ideology would resist the\ncombination of a positivist-ideology view. The radical would find in\nthe positivist emphasis on institutions a too uncritical attitude to\nthe ideological structures that shape those institutions. But it seems\npossible that the positivist position could be interpreted to remove\nany ascribing of legitimacy to the institutions that define law in\norder to accommodate the critique of the radical ideology\nposition. \n\nAs for the natural law position, the Marxist view of law as ideology\nconcedes to the natural lawyer that law is normative. What is\nideology, after all, but a set of values and ideals? However, on the\nMarxist view, the norms are defined in terms of the interests they\nserve, rather than the justice they embody. Law is normative, but it\nis certainly not moral, the Marxist insists against the natural\nlawyer. The critical aspect of the radical ideology view suggests an\nimpasse between the natural lawyer and the ideology position that is\nmore difficult to overcome than in the positivist case. \n\nOf course, natural lawyers and positivists could quite easily find\nroom for the liberal view of ideology as an action-oriented system of\nbeliefs as a supplement to their views about the sources of law, in the\nsense that ideology is part of the sociological landscape to which\ntheir concepts of law apply. Natural law can find popular expression in\na society’s ideology, and positivist legal institutions might reflect\nideological beliefs. \n\nAll this points to another and related tension. This is the tension\nbetween the radical ideology view and the concept of the rule of law, the\ncentrepiece of a liberal legal order. At their most basic, the terms\nthe rule of law, due process, procedural justice, legal formality,\nprocedural rationality, justice as regularity, all refer to the idea\nthat law should meet certain procedural requirements so that the\nindividual is enabled to obey it. These requirements center on the\nprinciple that the law be general, that it take the form of\nrules. Law by definition should be directed to more than a\nparticular situation or individual; as Lon Fuller notes, the rule of\nlaw also requires that law be relatively certain, clearly expressed,\nopen, prospective and adequately publicised. \n\nThe view of law as ideology, even in its radical variants, would not\ndeny the presence of the rule of law in the liberal legal order;\nindeed, the rule of law is often invoked as a paradigmatic example of\nlegal ideology. This is because, however, the rule of law is\ninterpreted as a device that serves the interests of the powerful;\nmoreover, it is a device that dissembles itself. The rule of law, in\nits restraint on the exercise of governmental and judicial power,\nfacilitates the aims of those with power of other kinds, particularly\neconomic power. This is not a surprising argument, if one considers how\nright-wing thinkers like Frederick Hayek (1971, 57–9) have lauded the rule of law\nfor its essential role in buttressing the free market. Left wing and\nright wing thinkers are agreed, then, on the capitalist function of the\nrule of law. \n\nFor the left-wing theorist of ideology, however, the rule of law\nalso has ideological aspects that mean it serves capitalist purposes in\nmore sinister ways. For in its restraint on political and legal power,\nthe rule of law implies that these public forms of power are the only\nforms of power that exist, or at least the only ones that matter.\nMoreover, in assuring the subjects of the law that that law is applied\nwith generality and certainty, the rule of law also implies that formal\njustice is the only relevant kind of justice; that equality before the\nlaw is identical to equality per se. \n\nThese claims about the rule of law and ideology are complex and need\ncareful scrutiny. Does the rule of law necessarily involve manipulation\non behalf of the capitalist order? Given its formal virtues, and its\nagnosticism on the content of law, the rule of law seems innocent of\ncharges of a capitalist bias, or a bias of any kind. As Raz puts it,\nthe rule of law’s virtue is like the virtue of a sharp knife; it\nenables the law to fulfill its function, whatever the function might\nbe (Raz 1979). Moreover, it is hard to see how the rule of law itself is engaged\nin any project of deception. Generality in the law, for example, does\nnot necessarily entail any particular commitments on how the economy or\nsociety should be organized; nor does it propagate falsity or error.\nNonetheless, it is true that the proceduralism of the rule of law can\nbe put to ideological purposes, to deflect social criticism and prevent\nradical change. And if enthusiasts of the rule of law place enough\nemphasis on procedural justice, this can reduce the likelihood that\nmore substantive conceptions of justice will have success.\nHistorically, societies governed by the rule of law have tended to be\nstructured by capitalist markets, suggesting an affinity between the\ntwo sets of institutions. The rule of law can have an ideological\neffect even if it is not ideological in its essence. \n\nThe idea that law is ideological is an important contribution to legal\nscholarship. First, it enables a more critical view of the law and its\nrole, and thereby demystifies a set of vital social\ninstitutions. Second, it points to the importance of sociological and\npolitical factors in our understanding of the law. Legality is shaped\nand influenced by non-legal aspects of society, and law, in turn, has\nan impact on society and social change, not just in the obvious\neffects of particular judgments, but in the political culture that a\nlegal system helps produce. \n\nThe Marxist view of law as ideology risks, however, an unhelpful\nreductionism.  Conceiving of law as ideological above all else in the\nMarxist sense can promote a crude and erroneous understanding of the\nrelation between power and legality, where law serves only the\ninterests of the powerful and where legal guarantees are mere\nshams. Moreover, this can license a cynicism about the law that is\nparadoxically contrary to the emancipatory aims of the radical\npolitics that was the impetus for the critique of law as ideology in\nthe first place. That is, radical critics risk dismissing altogether\nthe possibility of legal resources for remedying injustice. \n\nFurthermore, the cynicism of some ideology views is in fact the fruits\nof a kind of utopianism about law, for it counters the bleak portrait\nof legal ideology manipulated on behalf of the powerful with an ideal\nsociety without ideology or law, where human beings’ relations to each\nother and to reality are transparent and conflict-free. The ‘end\nof ideology’ thesis, advanced by Bell in a triumphalist spirit on\nbehalf of liberal capitalism, but interestingly even more salient in\nMarxist ideals of communism, might be wrong in its assumption that\nhuman beings can transcend ideology. Indeed, the radical concept of\nideology ultimately casts doubt on the likelihood that individuals’ beliefs can\never provide an objective account of reality, untainted by distorted and\nself-justifying processes of inquiry. \n\nHow then, can the concept of ideology be deployed in legal\nscholarship? In fact, the more subtle critiques of ideology grasp the\nextent to which both liberation and manipulation can be embodied in the\nlaw. Recall the nuanced conception of Marx and Engels, where ideology\ngives an inverted image of reality, but a recognizable image\nnonetheless. This suggests that the ideals of legality are not a mere\ncharade but are instantiated in the law, if only in a partial and\nincomplete form. The Marxist historian E.P. Thompson (1975, 265) made this point in\nhis argument for the universal value of the rule of law. Thompson\ncontended that in order for law to function as ideology it must\nproffer some genuine moral value. \n\nTo illustrate, consider how someone’s cruelty might be masked by\npolite manners; this does not demonstrate that good manners have no\nworth. Legal ideology, too, might paper over injustice in ways that\nserve justice nonetheless. A functional argument about ideology, then,\nmust concede the value of the phenomenon that serves ideological aims.\nIdeology cannot be devoid of emancipatory aspects altogether; if law\ntrumpets justice, equality and freedom, then it must succeed in\nrealizing these ideals, however imperfectly, in order for law to\nfunction as ideology. We can thus appreciate legal guarantees of a\nprocedural kind for the genuine protection they offer the subjects of\nthe law, whilst at the same time conceding the quietist politics that\nproceduralism might engender.  The values of legal proceduralism have had considerable influence\non political philosophy, particularly liberalism.  We saw that in his\ncritique of the welfare state, Hayek contended that law’s\nprocedural rules dictated a laissez-faire economy in which the state\nis expected only to provide a framework for private initiatives.\nLeft-wing liberals such as Rawls and Dworkin, in contrast, insist that\nthe state properly plays a role in remedying economic disadvantage.\nRawls was concerned that citizens enjoy the genuine\n‘worth’ or ‘fair value’ of equal political\nliberties (Rawls 2007, 148–9). Moreover, he also took the view\nthat both liberal democratic socialism and a property-owning democracy\nwere candidates for realizing his principles of justice. Articulating\nthis as an effort to find an ‘alternative to capitalism’\n(2001, 135–6), Rawls was picking up on the claim in his\npolitical philosophy lectures that Marx’s idea of ‘freely\nassociated producers’ involves a ‘democratic economic\nplan’ (2007, 372). \n\nNonetheless, Rawls’s political liberalism does not reject\nHayek’s counsel altogether, retaining a preoccupation with\nkeeping the state at bay.  In particular, Rawls contends that\n‘the basic institutions and public policies of justice’\nshould be understood as ‘neutral with respect to comprehensive\ndoctrines and their associated conceptions of the good’ (2001,\n153n27).  Rawls’s ‘neutrality of aim’ (2001, 153n27)\nreflects what Raz dubbed (1994, 46) an ‘epistemic withdrawal\nfrom the fray’ which dictates that the scope of the political be\nconstrained by formal procedures: the decision process of the original\nposition; the tenets of public reason; or political liberalism’s\nexplicit exclusion of considerations about the good life.  Indeed,\nRawls’s proceduralist ethic became especially prominent in his\nlater work, where the focus on constitutional questions over the\nremedy of economic disadvantage attracted much critical comment (see\nBarry 1995; Okin 1993; Williams 1993). \n\nIt should be noted that Rawls put much store by ‘the good’\nof a well-ordered political society (2001, 198–9) and admitted that\nperfectionist views about valuable ways of living might play a role in\nlegislative decisions about ‘suitably circumscribed\nquestions’ such as the protection of wildlife habitat (2001,\n152n26).  However, he retained a traditional view of perfectionism as\nin principle inegalitarian, involving the idea that ‘some people\nhave special claims because their greater gifts enable them to engage\nin the higher activities that realise perfectionist values’\n(2001, 152). ‘Egalitarian perfectionists’ such as the\nauthor of this entry, in contrast, argue it is human flourishing that\nwe should seek to make more equal in our theories of justice.  On\nthis, doubtless controversial, view, the concern for impartiality in\nthe law should not be allowed to have ‘imperialistic\ndesigns’ on all political questions (Sypnowich 2017, 85–7), so\nthat the community forfeits its responsibility to foster equal human\nwellbeing. \n\nNevertheless, concerns about the ideological impact of proceduralism\ndo not call into question the valuable role that the rule of law\nitself should play, even in the most ambitious egalitarian community.\nThe potential for a dismissive approach to law, perhaps, along with\nthe general decline of the influence of Marxism, accounts for why some\nrecent literature has avoided the term ‘ideology’ and\nopted instead for terms like ‘discourse’ or\n‘narrative’. Such terms also suggest that law should be\nunderstood in a political context, but they are less specific about\nthe nature of that context or its impact.  This seems a loss.\nProperly understood, the concept of ideology offers a nuanced and\nilluminating approach to legality that gives a precise rendering of\nthe relation between law and politics that need not be nihilist or\nreductionist. After all, a proper understanding of the ideological\nrole of law is compatible with other conceptions of how law is to be\ndefined or understood.  This is particularly so if we recognize the\nimprobability of eliminating altogether ideological modes of\nunderstanding.  \n\nA conception of law as having a moral source, or a\nsource in a system’s institutions, can be independent of a realistic\nappraisal of law’s ideological function, or the ideological process in\nwhich laws are made. Indeed, radical critics of the ‘war on\nterror’ waged by western governments have pointed to the value\nof liberal legal ideals such as human rights and the rule of law at\nthe same time as they have noted the ideological purposes to which\nsuch ideals are put.  Both positivists and natural lawyers, so long as\nthey do not insist that their conceptions of law are exhaustive of\nlaw’s reality, can permit the influence of ideology, even in its more\nradical interpretations. Law can be ideology as well as other moral or\ninstitutional phenomena at the same time; indeed, law will probably\nnot succeed as ideology unless it is multi-dimensional in just this\nway.","contact.mail":"christine.sypnowich@queensu.ca","contact.domain":"queensu.ca"}]
