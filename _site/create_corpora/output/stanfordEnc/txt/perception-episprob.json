This problem has\ntraditionally been viewed in terms of a skeptical argument that\npurports to show that such knowledge and justification are impossible. Skepticism about the\nexternal world highlights a number of epistemological difficulties\nregarding the nature and epistemic role of experience, and the\nquestion of how perception might bring us into contact with a\nmind-independent reality. The issues that arise are of central\nimportance for understanding knowledge and justification more\ngenerally, even aside from their connection to skepticism.\n\n\nTwo main types of\nresponse to the skeptical argument have traditionally been given: a\nmetaphysical response that focuses on the nature of the world,\nperceptual experience, and/or the relation between them, in an effort\nto show that perceptual knowledge is indeed possible; and a more\ndirectly epistemological response that focuses on principles\nspecifying what is required for knowledge and/or justification, in an\neffort to show that skepticism misstates the requirements for\nknowledge.\n\n\nMuch of the philosophical tradition has viewed the central\nepistemological problems concerning perception largely and sometimes\nexclusively in terms of the metaphysical responses to\nskepticism. For that reason, these will be addressed before moving on\nto the more explicitly epistemological concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question of how our perceptual beliefs are justified or\nknown can be approached by first considering the question of\nwhether they are justified or known. A prominent skeptical\nargument is designed to show that our perceptual beliefs are not\njustified. Versions of this argument (or cluster of arguments) appear\nin René Descartes’s Meditations,\nAugustine’s Against the Academicians, and several of the\nancient and modern skeptics (e.g., Sextus Empiricus, Michel de\nMontaigne). The argument introduces some type of skeptical scenario,\nin which things perceptually appear to us just as things normally do,\nbut in which the beliefs that we would naturally form are radically\nfalse. To take some standard examples: differences in the sense organs\nand/or situation of the perceiver might make her experience as cold\nthings that we would experience as hot, or experience as bitter things\nthat we would experience as sweet; a person might mistake a vivid\ndream for waking life; or a brain in a vat might have its sensory\ncortices stimulated in such a way that it has the very same perceptual\nexperiences that I am currently having, etc. \nIt is usually not specified how one gets from here to the conclusion\nthat our perceptual beliefs are unjustified. I offer one possible\nreconstruction of the skeptical argument, one which helps to\nillustrate the central problems in the epistemology of perception. \nThe skeptical scenarios (dreaming, brains in vats, differently\nsituated sense organs, etc.) call our attention to a crucial\ndistinction between appearance and reality: how things perceptually\nappear is not necessarily how things really are; things could appear\nthe same though really be different, and they could appear to be some\nother, incompatible way and really be the same. Further reflection on\nthe scenarios suggests that although I might know very\nlittle—perhaps nothing—about how things are in the\nexternal world, I can nevertheless know quite a lot about how it\nappears to me that things are. This engenders a shift from thinking\nabout perceptual appearances as features of objects (e.g., “the\nappearance of the house was quite shabby”), to thinking of them\nas mental states—experiences—of the perceiving subject\n(e.g., “she had a visual appearance/experience as of a\nhouse”). Finally, it seems that if we are to know anything about\nthe external world at all, that knowledge must be indirect, for what\nis directly before me is not the world itself, but only these\nperceptual appearances. I know and have justified beliefs about the\nexternal world only insofar as I know and have justified beliefs about\nappearances. \nAll this suggests a “veil of perception” between us and\nexternal objects: we do not have direct unvarnished access to the\nworld, but instead have an access that is mediated by sensory\nappearances, the character of which might well depend on all kinds of\nfactors (e.g., condition of sense organs, direct brain stimulation,\netc.) besides those features of the external world that our perceptual\njudgments aim to capture. Paraphrasing David Hume (1739: I.2.vi,\nI.4.ii; 1748: sec 12.1; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell\n1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception\nexcept perceptual appearances. \nBut if our only access to the external world is mediated by\npotentially misleading perceptual appearances, we ought to have some\nassurance that the appearances we are relying on are not of\nthe misleading variety. And here is where all the trouble arises, for\nit seems that there is no way we could have any evidence for the\nreliability of perception (i.e., perceptual appearances) without\nrelying on other perceptions. We have empirical reason, for example,\nto think that science is not yet capable of stimulating brains in a\nvery precise way, but appealing to this to rebut the possibility of\nbrain-in-a-vat scenarios seems blatantly question begging. At the\nheart of the problem of the external world is a skeptical argument I\nwill refer to as “PEW” and which I reconstruct in what\nfollows. I have named the premises, as we will want to discuss them\nindividually. \nA few comments on the logic of the argument are in order.\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n make up the meat of the argument; together they entail\n (4).\n This means that\n (1),\n which is motivated by the skeptical scenarios mentioned above and the\nassociated veil of perception view, would be unnecessary for deriving\nthe skeptical conclusion, as are those skeptical scenarios, were it\nnot for the fact that\n (1)\n is commonly taken to render perception inferential in such a\nway as to lend support to\n (2).\n If\n (1)\n is true, then, plausibly,\n (2)\n is: if our access is mediated by potentially nonveridical\nappearances, then we should only trust the appearances we have reason\nto think veridical. And no other reason to endorse\n (2)\n is immediately apparent (although an additional motivation for\n (2)\n will be discussed below, in\n section 3.1).\n (1) is therefore an important component of the traditional\nproblem. The plausibility of\n (3)\n derives from the idea that our only means of verifying the\nveridicality of appearances would itself depend on perception, in the\nquestion-begging manner sketched above. \nNotice that PEW addresses justification rather than knowledge. On the\nreasonable assumption that knowledge requires justification,\n (4)\n implies that our perceptual beliefs do not count as knowledge. One\nwho denies this assumption could easily rewrite PEW in terms of\nknowledge rather than justification with little or no reduction in\nplausibility. I have reconstructed PEW in a way that is supposed to be\nintuitively compelling. Were we to get specific about the implicit\nquantification involved (we have no good reason for thinking that\nany perceptual appearances are veridical? that perceptual\nappearances are in general veridical? that this\nperceptual appearance is veridical?), the argument would get a lot\nmore complicated. The simpler version presented above is sufficient\nfor our current purposes. \nThe problem of the external world should be distinguished from what is\ntypically called the problem of perception (see the entry on the\n problem of perception),\n even though they are motivated by similar considerations, in\nparticular, by the Indirectness Principle. The problem of perception\nis the problem of how perception is possible—how it is\npossible, for example, to see mind-independent objects,\nrather than inferring them from awareness of sense-experiences, in\nlight of the claim that only appearances are ever directly present to\nthe mind. The problem of the external world is a distinctively\nepistemological problem, and it focuses on the normative status of\nperceptual judgments about external objects; it matters little for\nthese purposes whether and how such judgments might amount to\nseeing. What matters is whether such judgments are or could\nbe justified. \nPEW illustrates the central problem of the epistemology of perception:\nif many or any of our perceptual beliefs are justified, PEW must have\ngone wrong somewhere. But where? Several subsidiary problems in the\nepistemology of perception arise in the efforts to solve this central\nproblem. \nThe Indirectness Principle is a metaphysical principle: it\nsays something about the nature of perception. The Metaevidential\nPrinciple and the Reasons Claim are epistemic principles: one\nlays down specifically normative requirements for justified belief and\nthe other denies that these requirements are satisfied. Because PEW\ncan be challenged by denying any of the premises, there are two main\nclasses of solution to the central problem: metaphysical solutions,\nwhich challenge the Indirectness Principle; and epistemological\nsolutions, which challenge the Metaevidential Principle and/or the\nReasons Claim. This section addresses the first class of solutions to\nthe central problem.\n Section 3\n addresses the second class. \nPEW starts with the Indirectness Principle, and it has often been\nthought that the central skeptical worry is due to a metaphysics of\nperception that holds that, although worldly objects do exist outside\nof the mind, they are never directly present to the mind, but only\nindirectly so, through mental intermediaries. Thomas Reid, for\nexample, held that “Des Cartes’ system … hath some\noriginal defect; that this skepticism is inlaid in it, and reared\nalong with it” (1785: 1.vii). Consequently, a great deal of\nphilosophy since Descartes has involved various attempts to block PEW\nby doing away with the intermediaries between the mind and the objects\nof perception, by offering a metaphysics of perception that puts these\nobjects directly before the mind. If perception is direct in the\nrelevant sense, then the skeptical problem never even gets off the\nground. \nThere are two main branches to this tradition. The more obvious and\ncommonsensical one originates with Reid (1764, 1785) who denies that\nonly mental items can be directly present to the mind, arguing that\nphysical objects and their properties can be directly present as well.\nThis is the direct realist option. A somewhat older tradition,\nhowever, tracing back to George Berkeley (1710, 1713), agrees with\nDescartes that only mental items are directly present to the mind but\ninsists that the objects of perception—tables, rocks, cats,\netc.—are really mental items after all. This is the\nidealist/phenomenalist option. Despite the manifest differences\nbetween realist and idealist metaphysics, both branches of the\n“direct presence” tradition are united in rejecting the\nIndirectness Principle, insisting that tables and such are indeed\ndirectly present to the mind in perception. If perception is thus\ndirect, the Indirectness Principle is false, and support for the\nMetaevidential Principle is undercut, and PEW ceases to pose a threat\nto knowledge. \nWhether in the realist or idealist tradition, the direct presence\ntheorist rejects the Indirectness Principle, insisting that when one\nperceives a cat, for example, the cat is directly in view, directly\npresent to, simply there before the mind. But what is meant\nby these spatial metaphors? The metaphors can be unpacked in several\nimportantly different ways, having different implications for the rest\nof PEW. In the next five subsections, I will briefly distinguish some\ndifferent ways in which perception might be (or fail to be) direct.\nThe spatial/metaphorical terminology has been so vastly prevalent in\nthe literature that it is very often hard to tell which author intends\nwhich conception(s) of directness. Consequently, I won’t be\nnaming names much in the next few paragraphs or pinning particular\nconceptions of directness on particular authors. Instead, these\nparagraphs aim to map out the more salient possibilities. Later, in\nsections\n 2.2\n and\n 2.3,\n I will use these distinctions to examine how the traditional\nmetaphysical theories of perception bear on the epistemology of\nperception. \nBefore we try to understand “direct presence”, notice that\nwhat is metaphorical here is the notion of presence, not of\ndirectness. To be directly present is to be present, but not\nin virtue of the presence of another thing (that would be\nindirect presence). Directness is merely unmediatedness, but\nwhat kind of mediation is at issue will depend on what kind of\npresence is intended. \nOne dimension of directness, emphasized by Reid (1785), notes that\nperceptual judgments are phenomenally noninferential, in the sense\nthat they do not result from any discursive or ratiocinative process;\nthey are not introspectibly based on premises. This noninferentiality\nis usually understood loosely enough to allow for perceptual\nbeliefs’ being based on things other than beliefs (in\nparticular, on experiential states, as we will see below) and also to\nallow for the possibility of unconscious or subpersonal inferential\ninvolvement in the formation of perceptual beliefs, so long as the\nagent is not deliberately basing these perceptual beliefs on\nother beliefs. Without these two allowances, claims of\nnoninferentiality would quickly run afoul of standard views in\nepistemology and psychology, respectively. To claim that perception is\nphenomenally direct is to claim that it is noninferential in this\nsense. \nAnother way that perception might be direct is if perception\nrepresents external objects, as such, without that representation\nbeing mediated by representation of other things. Contrast this with\nthe classical empiricists’ opposing view, that the only way to\nrepresent external objects is as the cause of our sensations (Locke\n1690, Berkeley 1710). One might worry, however, that unless perception\nputs objects directly before us, we are in danger of not genuinely\nbeing able to think about the objective, external world at all, but\nonly about ourselves. To say that perception is referentially direct\nis to say that the ability of perceptual states to represent does not\ndepend on the ability of other states to represent. \nOne version of indirectness claims that we perceive outer\nthings by perceiving (or standing in a quasi-perceptual\nrelation to) inner things—usually sense-data (see below and\n the entry on sense-data).\n This makes it sound as if what we thought was ordinary direct\nperceiving of tables and rocks and such is really more like\n“perceiving” that someone has broken into your\nhouse—indirectly, on the basis of actually perceiving the broken\nwindow, empty area where the TV used to be, etc. It is easy to see how\nsuch perceptual indirectness may invite the semantic and\nepistemological worries we have been seeing. To claim that perception\nof external objects is perceptually direct is to claim that it is not\nmediated by the perception (or quasi-perceptual apprehension\nor awareness) of something else. \nOne could endorse phenomenal directness and perceptual directness\nwhile still holding that perceptual contact is mediated by experience,\nwhere experience is conceived as something in virtue of which we have\nperceptual contact, though it is not the perceptual contact itself. An\nalternative is a relational metaphysics of perception according to\nwhich elements of the perceived world are literally parts of the\nperceptual experience. On idealist versions of this view, the mental\nstates whose immediate apprehension constitutes perceptual experience\njust are the objects of perception (or parts of these\nobjects). On (direct) realist versions of the view, perceptual\nexperiences are not internal mental states of the agent but are\nrelations between the agent and some external objects or states of\naffairs. Thus the agent is in a different type of mental state in the\ncase of veridical perception (the “good case”) than in the\ncase of hallucination (the “bad case”). Veridical\nperception is a certain kind of relation to a distal array, while\nhallucination or dreaming is an introspectively indistinguishable but\nmetaphysically distinct relation to something else entirely. \nFinally, one might hold that perception is direct in the sense that\none’s perceptual beliefs about external objects, like rocks and\ncats and such, enjoy a kind of justification or knowledge that does\nnot depend on—is not mediated by—any other justification\nor knowledge. Such beliefs are said to be or “epistemically\nnoninferential”, or “epistemologically basic” and\nthe normative status is sometimes referred to as “immediate\njustification/knowledge” or “basic\njustification/knowledge”. This possibility will be explored in\nmore detail below, in\n section 3.4.\n Epistemological directness will be treated separately from the\nprevious senses of direct presence, which can all be viewed as\nmetaphysical senses of direct presence. The relation between\nmetaphysical and epistemological directness will be addressed below,\nin\n section 2.4. \nWith these distinctions in hand, we can better situate the traditional\ntheories of perception that are often thought to bear on the skeptical\nproblem. \nIdealism and phenomenalism are views that hold that ordinary objects\n(tables, clouds, rocks, etc.) are really collections of or constructs\nout of actual and/or possible mental states, especially perceptual\nexperiences. (I won’t try to distinguish phenomenalism from\nidealism but will use “idealism” to include both.) There\nare several varieties of idealism and several motivations for holding\nthe view. But one motivation is that it promises to solve the\nskeptical problem of the external world. Berkeley (1710) held that\nidealism was a cure for skepticism. Transcendental idealism (Kant\n1781) aims to split the difference with the skeptic by distinguishing\nthe phenomenal objects of perception—which are collections of\nappearances and about which we can know something—from the\nnoumenal objects—which are things in themselves and not mere\nappearances, and about which skepticism is true. \nOne way in which idealism might help to solve the skeptical problem is\nby attacking the Indirectness Principle. If the problem of the\nexternal world starts with the gap between the proximal and the distal\nobjects of perceptual experience, then idealism would avoid skepticism\nby simply closing that gap. The idealist can embrace direct\nworld-involvement while retaining the claim that nothing is ever\ndirectly present to the mind but its own mental states, by holding\nthat the world is fundamentally mental, that, e.g., tables are just\ncollections of ideas. Although metaphysical solutions are usually\naimed at the Indirectness Principle, idealism also offers a response\nto PEW by way of undermining the Reasons Claim. Hume (1739) argued\nthat we couldn’t have any good reason to think that external\nobjects are plausible causes of our experiences without first\nobserving a constant conjunction between external objects and\nexperiences; but we can’t “observe” external objects\nunless we justifiedly believe in their existence, and we can only do\nthat if we can reasonably posit them as plausible causes of our\nexperiences. On the other hand, if the objects of perception are not\nexternal after all, we are in a better position to infer causal\nrelations between them and individual experiences. \nThe main difference between idealism and an indirect realism concerns\nnot so much the metaphysics of perception as a larger metaphysical\nview about what else exists outside of the mind. Berkeley and\nDescartes agree about the direct objects of perception, but Descartes\nposits an additional stratum of mind-independent external objects in\naddition. The idealist denies that there is a veil of perception not\nbecause Descartes was wrong about the nature of perception, but\nbecause he was wrong about the natures of cats and rocks. \nIdealism has a few contemporary defenders (e.g., Foster 2008, Hoffman\n2009), though it is nowhere near the dominant view that it had been\nfor almost two centuries after Berkeley. Most responses to PEW in the\nlast century have endorsed some kind of realism instead, insisting\nthat ordinary objects are indeed mind-independent. \nThe problem of the external world, especially the Indirectness\nPrinciple, sees its modern renaissance in Descartes’s\nrepresentative realism, which was offered as an alternative to both\nthe commonsense view of naive (aka direct) realism, and the\nhylomorphic theory standard among Scholastics. This latter doctrine\nholds that objects are combinations of primordial matter and forms\nimpressed upon them, which determine the objects’ properties;\nthese objects then cast off forms that can enter the mind through the\nsense organs. A red thing is simply something that has the form of\nRED, which it can transmit, making the receptive, perceiving mind\nalso—though presumably in a different sense—red. \nBoth theories suffer from an apparent inability to handle error.\nScience frequently teaches us that things are not in reality the way\nthey appear to the senses. The sun, for example, perceptually appears\nas a small disk rather than the large sphere that it is (Descartes\n1641). This perceptual experience cannot involve either the\ntransmission of forms (since the sun doesn’t have those forms),\nor the “direct pick-up” of objective properties (again,\nthose properties aren’t there to pick up). Nor could we simply\nbe picking up relational properties, like looking small from\nhere, Descartes argues, because I could have the very same\nperceptual experience in a vivid dream (where even the relational\nproperties are not instantiated) as I do in waking life. Therefore,\nperceptual appearances must be entirely mental and internal, rather\nthan relational. Insofar as external objects are at all present to the\nmind, it is only because of these appearances, which thus serve as\ninner stand-ins, or proxies, for them. As John Locke puts it,  \nthe understanding is not much unlike a closet wholly shut from light,\nwith only some little openings left, to let in external visible\nresemblances, or ideas of things without. (1690: 163)  \nIt is this notion of standing in that the term “representative\nrealism” is supposed to capture. The representative realist may,\nbut need not, hold that these proxies are also\nrepresentations in the sense of having semantic contents,\ni.e., truth- or accuracy-conditions. In fact, the most recognizable\nform of representative realism denies that experiences are in this\nsense representational. \nThis best known, though now widely rejected, form of representative\nrealism incorporates a sense-datum theory\n (see the entry on  sense-data),\n which holds that every perceptual experience as of something’s\nbeing F involves the subject’s awareness of something\nthat really is F. My having a perceptual (veridical or\nhallucinatory) experience as of something’s being blue requires\nthere to be a nonphysical, inner, mental object—a\nsense-datum—that is blue. Sense-data are not normally taken to\nbe true or false, any more than rocks or tables are; nonetheless,\nsense-data constitute the inner rocks and tables in virtue of which we\nperceive external rocks and tables and are in that sense the\nlatter’s representatives. Two important features of this theory\nare worth highlighting: (i) that sense-data really do have the\nproperties that external objects appear to have, and (ii) that the\nrelation one stands in to one’s sense-data is a perceptual, or\nquasi-perceptual, relation: one is perceptually aware of objects due\nto a more fundamental awareness of one’s sense-data. \nAny version of representative realism denies direct world-involvement.\nThe sense-datum theory is further incompatible with perceptual\ndirectness, as it has us perceive objects by way of perceiving our\nsense-data; and it is typically fleshed out in such a way as to be\nincompatible with referential directness as well, holding that we can\nthink about mind-independent objects only as the external causes of\nthese sense-data. It is compatible, however, with phenomenal and\nepistemological directness. For example, one could deny that the\n“inference” from sense-data to external objects is\nconscious and deliberate and insist that only such deliberate\ninferences would render a belief epistemically inferential (i.e.,\nnonbasic) in the sense of\n 2.1.5\n above. \nIntentionalism holds that to have a perceptual experience as\nof something blue is to be in a state with a distinctively\nsemantic property of meaning blue, of referring to\nthe property of blueness\n (see the entry on\n  consciousness and intentionality).\n On this view, the inner states are not just representatives but\nrepresentations; they have semantic values. Such\nrepresentations typically lack the properties they depict external\nobjects as having. Furthermore, the relation one stands in to\none’s perceptual representations is not necessarily a\nquasi-perceptual one: it is normally held that one simply\nhas, or tokens, the representations; they are not in\nany sense objects of perception or awareness in the ordinary\ncourse of events, but the vehicles of perception (Huemer\n2001). (They might, of course, become objects of something like\nperception if we reflectively attend to them, but this is something\nmore than merely having the experience.)  \nSense-datum and intentionalist views both see perceptual experience as\na two-place relation between perceiver and inner representative.\nAdverbialism, on the other hand, holds that perceptual\nexperience itself is monadic; it doesn't involve the\nperceiver standing in a relation to something\n (see the entry on the \n  problem of perception).[1]\n Different kinds of perceptual experiences are simply different ways\nof sensing: one “senses greenly” or “is appeared to\nhorsely”, and such locutions do not commit us to the existence\nof either sense-data or representations. Adverbialism is sometimes\noffered as an ontologically neutral way of talking about experiences\n(Chisholm 1957), sometimes as the more contentious claim that\nperceptual experience is primitive and unanalyzable. \nIntentionalism and adverbialism deny direct world-involvement but are\ncompatible with the other varieties of directness. They are also\ncompatible with any of the corresponding varieties of\nindirectness. \nProponents of intentionalist and adverbialist theories have often\nthought of themselves as defending a kind of direct realism; Reid\n(1785), for example, clearly thinks his proto-adverbialist view is a\ndirect realist view. And perceptual experience is surely less indirect\non an intentionalist or adverbialist theory than on the typical\nsense-datum theory, at least in the sense of perceptual directness.\nNevertheless, intentionalist and adverbialist theories render the\nperception of worldly objects indirect in at least two important ways:\n(a) it is mediated by an inner state, in that one is in\nperceptual contact with an outer object of perception only (though not\nentirely) in virtue of being in that inner state; and (b) that inner\nstate is one that we could be in even in cases of radical perceptual\nerror (e.g., dreams, demonic deception, etc.). These theories might\nthus be viewed as only “quasi-direct” realist theories;\nexperiences still screen off the external world in the sense that\nwhether the agent is in the good case or the bad case, the experience\nmight still be the same. Quasi-direct theories thus reject the\nIndirectness Principle only under some readings of\n“directness”. A fully direct realism would offer an\nunequivocal rejection of the Indirectness Principle by denying that we\nare in the same mental states in the good and the bad cases. In recent\nyears, direct realists have wanted the perceptual relation to be\nentirely unmediated: we don’t achieve perceptual contact with\nobjects in virtue of having perceptual experiences; the\nexperience just is the perceptual contact with the\nobject. \nIn recent years, therefore, “direct realism” has been\nusually reserved for the view that perceptual experience is\nconstituted by the subject’s standing in certain relations to\nexternal objects, where this relation is not mediated by or analyzable\nin terms of further, inner states of the agent. Thus, the brain in the\nvat could not have the same experiences as a normal veridical\nperceiver, because experience is itself already world-involving. \nA type of direct realism that has received much recent attention is\ndisjunctivism (e.g., Snowdon 1980, McDowell 1982, Martin 2002, Haddock\n& Macpherson 2008; see the entry on the \n disjunctive theory of perception).\n There are many different versions of disjunctivism, but a common\nthread is the claim that the experiences involved in the veridical\ncase are ipso facto of a different type than those involved in the\nhallucinatory cases. The theory of appearing (Alston 1999) is a type\nof disjunctivism but one that emphasizes the direct world-involvement\nin the veridical case rather than the radical difference between the\ncases. \nSome forms of behaviorism, functionalism, and embodied mind are also\ndirect realist views. If, for example, having a certain perceptual\nexperience constitutively involves being disposed to act on worldly\nobjects and properties in certain ways—that is, if behavioral\ndispositions are themselves individuated as world-involving—then\nthis would render the experience relational in the way required by\ndirect realism; disembodied brains in vats could not have the same\nexperiences as we have in normal, veridical cases. Similar\nconsequences follow if perceptual experience is understood in terms of\n“skilled coping” (Dreyfus 2002) or “sensorimotor\nknow-how” (Noë 2004), again, if these terms are read as\nrequiring certain interactions with real, external objects. Any such\ntheory implies that brains in vats couldn’t have the same\nexperiences we do, because they’re causally disconnected from\nthe physical world. Such a view need not be a form of disjunctivism,\nhowever; depending on the details of the theory, a hallucinating\nsubject who is nevertheless embedded in and disposed to act on the\nworld in the right ways might have the same experience as a\nveridically perceiving subject. \nDirect realism is compatible with all the metaphysical species of\ndirect presence listed above. As such, it allows for an unequivocal\ndenial of premise\n (1)\n of PEW, while quasi-realist views only reject that premise under\ncertain understandings of direct presence. \nIf representative realism is the cause of the central epistemological\nproblem for perception, then perhaps direct realism or idealism will\nbe the solution. Some philosophers have thought that these\nmetaphysical views resolved the epistemological problem by closing the\ngap between appearance and reality, by making ordinary objects (e.g.,\ntables and rocks) directly present to the mind. \nOn further reflection, however, it is clear that the metaphysical\naccount will be, at best, a part of the solution. \nConsider again PEW: \nMost metaphysical solutions attack the Indirectness Principle as a way\nof undercutting the Metaevidential Principle. But they only attack\nmetaphysical readings of the Indirectness Principle, and while the\nvarious metaphysical theories of perception from sections\n 2.2\n and\n 2.3\n may have certain intuitive affinities with the Metaevidential\nPrinciple or its denial, it follows from Hume’s “no\nought from is” dictum that none of them\nimmediately implies either premise\n (2)\n or its negation. Epistemological directness does straightforwardly\nentail the rejection of\n (2),\n but epistemological directness is compatible with any of the\nmetaphysical theories of perception glossed above and is entailed by\nnone of them. At best, a metaphysical theory of perception will block\none avenue of intuitive support for\n (2),\n but it will not imply that\n (2)\n is false. \nAn idealist, for example, will allow that we sometimes dream and that\nthere is a real difference between hallucination and veridical\nperception, even though in both cases the direct object of awareness\nis a collection of ideas. The standard view (Berkeley 1710) is that a\nhallucinatory table is a different sort of collection of\nideas than a real table; certain counterfactuals are true of the\nlatter that are not true of the former (e.g., that if I were to will\ncertain movements, my visual perceptions would change in certain ways,\netc.). But this reopens the gap between perceptual experiences and\nordinary objects. Tables are not just experiences; they are larger\nentities of which experiences are parts, and those parts are shared by\nhallucinations. So what is directly present to the mind is something\ncommon to hallucination and veridical perception. So my perceptual\nexperience would seem to be neutral with respect to whether I am\nseeing or hallucinating a table. So to be justified in believing there\nis a table in front of me, I will need some reason to think this\nparticular experience is veridical, and PEW is back in business\n(Alston 1993, Greco 2000). \nDirect realism precludes this particular relapse into skepticism by\ndenying that the experience is the same in the good and the bad cases.\nIf our perceptual evidence includes the experience, then our evidence\nin the good case is different from our evidence in the bad\ncase—they are different mental states. It does not follow,\nhowever, that these two bits of evidence have differing evidential\nimport; both may—for all we’ve been told so far—be\nevidentially neutral with respect to, e.g., whether there is actually\na chair in front of me or whether it merely appears so. Two very\ndifferent mental states might nevertheless license all the same\ninferences; most pertinently, both might only license beliefs of the\nform “I”m either seeing or hallucinating a table’.\nAdditionally, the direct realist is free to impose a metaevidential\ndemand on justified perceptual belief, a demand that we know which\nkind of experience we are having before that experience can serve as\nevidence. Unsurprisingly, direct realists tend to endorse some kind or\nother of epistemological directness\n (section 3.4\n below, especially\n 3.4.2),\n but the metaphysical view is by itself silent on this epistemological\nissue. \nEven with the metaphysical premise\n (1)\n removed, a purely epistemological version of PEW, consisting of\n (2)\n through\n (4),\n still challenges the justification of our perceptual beliefs. A\nsatisfying solution to the problem of the external world requires the\narticulation of some plausible epistemic principles, one that explains\nwhich of the two crucial premises\n (2)\n and\n (3)\n of PEW are being rejected, and provides an epistemological context\nwhich renders that rejection plausible. An entirely metaphysical\nsolution to the problem of the external world will not suffice. An\nepistemological solution to this epistemological problem will be\nneeded in addition or instead. \nEpistemological solutions to PEW deny one or more of its explicitly\nepistemological premises. They try to make that denial plausible and\nto situate it within a larger epistemology of perception and a larger\nepistemology more generally. \nFoundationalism is the view that some beliefs are epistemologically\nbasic—i.e., their justification does not depend on evidential\nsupport from other beliefs—and all other beliefs ultimately\nderive their justification from basic beliefs. (Basically justified\nbeliefs are sometimes referred to as “immediately\njustified” or “directly justified” as well.)\nClassical foundationalism is the view that (i) it is\nappearance beliefs—i.e., beliefs about perceptual\nappearances—that are basic, and perceptual beliefs about\nordinary objects are based at least partly on these, and (ii)\nperceptual justification requires us to have good reason to think that\nthe relevant current appearances are veridical. Basing is a relation\nof epistemic dependence and does not imply explicit\ninference, although particular theories might hold that the relation\nis satisfied only when inference occurs. \n(i) is defended in one of several ways. Here are brief versions of\nsome of the more common, often implicit, arguments: \n(ii) includes an endorsement of the Metaevidential Principle. We have\nlooked at representative realism as one motivation for that principle,\nbut there are others. Classical foundationalists have traditionally\nendorsed it because it follows from two other claims they find\nplausible. The first is (i) above, that our perceptual beliefs are\nbased on appearance beliefs. The second is the claim that in order to\nbe justified in believing hypothesis h on the basis of evidence\ne, one must be justified in believing that e makes\nh probable (or that e entails h, or e is\ngood evidence for h, etc.) This second claim is a version of\nRichard Fumerton’s “Principle of Inferential\nJustification” and is often defended by citing examples\n(Fumerton 1995; see the entry on \n foundationalist theories of justification).\n My belief that you’re going to die soon cannot be justified on\nthe basis of your tarot card reading unless I’m justified in\nbelieving that tarot cards really do tell the future. Whether such\nexamples generalize to all inferences is an open question.\nSome fairly strong though controversial forms of internalism (see the entry on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification)\n would imply the Principle of Inferential Justification as well. \nThe classical foundationalist avoids skepticism by rejecting the\nReasons Claim, insisting that we do often have good,\nnon-viciously-circular, reasons for thinking that our experiences are\nveridical. Two questions thus arise for classical foundationalism, one\nabout the nature and justification of appearance beliefs and one about\nthe allegedly non-circular inference from appearance beliefs to\nperceptual beliefs. \nAppearance beliefs are said not to be based on other beliefs. This\nraises the question of how they are themselves justified. \nAppearance beliefs are a species of introspective belief, and\nintrospection is sometimes thought to involve a “direct\ncontact”, or “confrontation”, or “acquaintance\nwith”, or “access to”, or\n“self-presentation” of certain truths. As we saw in\n section 2.1,\n regarding “direct presence”, such metaphors could be\nunpacked in a variety of ways. If claims about\n“acquaintance” and the like (for simplicity, I will refer\nto them all indiscriminately as “acquaintance”) are given\nan epistemological reading, then they seem to restate or reiterate the\nclassical foundationalist’s claim that we can have foundational\njustification for appearance beliefs, rather than to explain or argue\nfor that claim. If they are making some metaphysical claim, then the\nconsequences for epistemology are indirect and unclear.\nEpistemologists are sometimes less than fully explicit about how they\nare understanding acquaintance. And however acquaintance is\nunderstood, the classical foundationalist must make acquaintance broad\nenough that we are plausibly acquainted with appearances but narrow\nenough that we are not acquainted with physical objects as well. \nRoderick Chisholm’s (1977) conception of acquaintance (he calls\nit “self-presentation”) is explicitly and fundamentally\nepistemic—a self-presenting state is simply one such that a\nperson is justified in believing she is in it whenever she is actually\nin it. This doesn’t explain or argue for the special epistemic\nstatus of appearance beliefs, but Chisholm denies that this needs to\nbe argued: it is self-presenting that appearance beliefs are\nself-presenting. In a somewhat similar vein, Fumerton (1995, 2001)\nclaims that the acquaintance relation is not an epistemic relation but\ninsists that it is sui generis and unanalyzable; he holds that we\nnevertheless understand the acquaintance relation, as we are\nacquainted with it. \nAttempts to explicate acquaintance in non-epistemic terms fall into\none of two categories. The traditional way to understand acquaintance\nis in terms of a containment relation between appearance beliefs and\nappearances, with the result that appearance beliefs entail their own\ntruth. This is the indirect realist’s analogue of the\nworld-involvement invoked by direct realists (above, sections\n 2.1.4,\n 2.3.3). Descartes (1641) held that appearance beliefs, like any\nbelief about one’s own mental states, are infallible for this\nreason and thereby self-evident (and thus justified). Though some\nstill endorse this view (McGrew 2003), most epistemologists deny that\nwe are infallible in our self-attributions. A more modest claim is\nthat only some appearance beliefs are infallible. David\nChalmers (2003) argues that phenomenal qualities are literally\nelements or constituents of a special type of phenomenal concept\n(“direct phenomenal concepts”), and so introspective\njudgments that involve the application of such concepts cannot be\nmistaken. \nThis does not yet account for the distinctive epistemic status of\nappearance beliefs, as the epistemic implications of infallibility\nremain unclear, especially in the context of an internalist\nepistemology. One might believe some necessary truth as the result of\na lucky guess; the belief is infallible, but not justified. This seems\nat least in part to result from the fact that the infallibility\noccurs, in some sense, outside of the agent’s perspective. (The\ninfallibility involved in self-attribution, however, seems intuitively\nto fall within the agent’s perspective.) \nThe second type of approach views appearance beliefs as justified by\nsomething extrinsic to them, so that an appearance belief is justified\nwhen it is accompanied by acquaintance with the experiential fact that\nthe appearance belief describes. Laurence BonJour (2003), for example,\nunderstands acquaintance in terms of constitutivity, though in a very\ndifferent way from Chalmers. BonJour claims that awareness of the\nsensory content of an experience is partly constitutive of what it is\nto have a conscious experience. That awareness is thus infallible, but\nappearance beliefs—which purport to describe the\nexperience and constituent awareness—are fallible. \nAll the authors just mentioned, except for Chisholm, see acquaintance\nas a metaphysical (i.e., non-epistemic) relation that does not\nimmediately entail any epistemological theses. They lay down as a\nseparate, further thesis one that is not entailed by but is rendered\nhighly plausible, they think, by the nature of the acquaintance\nrelation: that when one is thus acquainted with an experience, one has\na strong prima facie justification to believe that one has\nthat experience, and furthermore, that justification does not depend\non any other beliefs. On either non-epistemic understanding of\nacquaintance, it puts us in a very good position to make correct\njudgments about our current experiences. Most classical\nfoundationalists allow that all appearance beliefs are defeasible\n(i.e., having a kind of justification that is capable of being\noverridden or undermined by further reasons); hence the claim made is\nmerely for prima facie, rather than ultima facie,\njustification. (To say that a belief is prima facie [aka\npro tanto] justified is to say that it is has some positive\nepistemic status, in the sense that it is justified if it is\nnot defeated by overriding or undermining considerations.) Chisholm\n(1977) and Timothy McGrew (2003) endorse the stronger claim that\nacquaintance provides indefeasible, ultima facie\njustification. \nIt is possible that the experience (or acquaintance with it) is\nintended to serve not only as a truth-maker and justifier for the\nappearance belief, but as evidence for that belief as well.\nBy “evidence” is meant here not just any factor that\nserves to confer justification on a belief, but something that serves\nas a ground, or reason, or rational basis,\nfor that\n belief.[2]\n Not all justification-conferring or justification-relevant factors\ncount as evidence in this sense (if they did, Earl Conee and Richard\nFeldman [2004] would not have to defend evidentialism). For\nexample, Descartes held that all clear and distinct judgments were\njustified, though certain judgments—e.g., “I\nthink”—are justified without evidential appeal to clarity\nand distinctness. It is the fact that it is clear and\ndistinct that makes it justified, not the agent’s awareness of\nthat fact or appreciation of that fact’s epistemic significance,\nso clarity and distinctness are not functioning here as evidence.\nSimilarly, reliabilism holds, roughly, that being reliably formed\nrenders a belief justified; although reliability need not—and\ntypically does not—figure in as the agent’s evidence or\ngrounds for believing something. Thus, one can claim that perceptual\nexperiences are nondoxastic (i.e., non-belief) states that serve as\nevidence for appearance beliefs, in much the way that beliefs serve as\nevidence for other beliefs, though with one crucial difference: for\none belief to serve as evidence for another, the former must be\njustified; experiences are not susceptible to justification, thus can\nbe neither justified nor unjustified, but—on this view—can\nnevertheless serve as evidence and confer justification on beliefs.\nThe justification of appearance beliefs would then depend on\nevidential connections to other mental states but not to other\nbeliefs, and because experiences need not be justified in order to\nserve as evidence, the threatened regress is halted in a way that is\nconsistent with foundationalism. The idea of such nondoxastic evidence\nraises several problems, as we will see shortly. \nClassical foundationalism is sometimes objected to on the grounds that\nwe typically do not have beliefs about our experiences (e.g., Pollock\n1986, Greco 2000). This raises interesting and difficult issues about\nthe natures of evidence and the basing relation. For the belief that\np to serve as justifying evidence for the belief that q,\nmust I consciously form the belief that p, or is it enough\nthat, e.g., I have good reason to believe that p? Surely the\nclassical foundationalist never denied phenomenal directness or\nthought our perceptual beliefs were reasoned out explicitly. If one\ncould show that only consciously formed beliefs could ground other\nbeliefs, this would be bad news indeed for classical foundationalism,\nbut this is a controversial claim. Alternatively, the objection might\nbe that we are typically not even yet in a position to form\njustified appearance beliefs, in some situations where we are already\nquite justified in our perceptual beliefs. Being in a position to form\njustified appearance beliefs would require further investigation, in\nan “inward” direction. This investigation is not always\neasy (Pollock 1986), and it is possible that such investigation would\nalter the nature of the experience. In addition, some perceivers may\nlack the conceptual resources to distinguish appearances from external\nobjects, although they seem to be justified in their perceptual\nbeliefs nonetheless. \nCartesian foundationalism was the strictest form of classical\nfoundationalism, requiring a deductive metaevidential argument for the\nreliability of perception. Descartes believed that he could give a\nnon-circular argument for thinking that some perceptual experiences\nwere veridical, by constructing an a priori argument for the\nreliability of perception. He also aimed for certainty, so his\nargument was a deductive one, starting with the existence and\nperfection of God and concluding that any clear and distinct awareness\n(including elements of perceptual awarenesses) must be true; so some\nperceptual experiences—namely, the clear and distinct\nones—are veridical. This would have licensed a rejection of the\nReasons Claim, by showing how we could have a good reason for thinking\nour experiences to be veridical. However, Descartes’s a\npriori arguments for the existence of God were at best\ncontroversial, and the theology needed to deduce the reliability of\nperception from the perfection of the deity was unconvincing, so\ndeductive metaevidential arguments along these lines were not pursued\nfurther. \nNonCartesian forms of classical foundationalism have tried to combine\nthe a priority required by non-circularity with a probabilistic form\nof inference, the most promising candidate being abduction, or\ninference to the best explanation (Russell 1912, BonJour 2003).\nAccording to this view, the best explanation of our experiences is the\ncommonsense hypothesis that there is a mind-independent external world\nthat conforms in some measure to these experiences and is the cause of\nthem. The superiority of this explanation to the alternatives\n(idealism, a Cartesian demon, etc.) is held to be an a priori\nmatter, thus not dependent on assuming the veridicality of the very\nexperiences the argument is supposed to legitimate. There is a good\ndeal of intuitive plausibility to the claim that an external world\nserves as the best explanation for our sense experience, but making\nthat case in any detail, especially enough to satisfy the idealist,\nwould require taking on some large and complex issues, like what makes\none explanation better than another\n (see they entry on abduction),\n and—since the commonsense view is sometimes (e.g., Russell\n1912, BonJour 2010) held to be simpler than\ncompetitors—what counts as simplicity, a vexed question in the\nphilosophy of science\n (see the entry on  simplicity).\n William Alston (1993) offers an influential critique of abductive\narguments for the reliability of sense-experience. \nFurthermore, if we are trying to explain how the ordinary\nperson’s perceptual beliefs are justified, then it is not enough\nthat there be some good deductive or abductive argument for\nthe reliability of perception; this argument must be in some important\nsense available to or possessed by the agent. Premise\n (2)\n of PEW, after all, is the claim that the agent must have\nsome good reason for thinking her experiences are veridical. Some\n(e.g., Pollock & Cruz 1999) think this imposes a significantly\nmore onerous burden on the proponent of classical foundationalism,\nalthough others (e.g., BonJour 2010) claim that the superiority of the\ncommonsense view is quite accessible to ordinary epistemic agents. \nOther foundationalists have responded to PEW by denying the\nMetaevidential Principle. Most such views have rejected both parts of\nthe standard argument for the Metaevidential Principle\n (3.1\n above), but one important exception is worth noting. Chisholm (1966,\n1977) agrees with the classical foundationalist that perceptual\nbeliefs are based on appearance beliefs but denies that any argument\nfor the legitimacy of the appearance-reality inference is needed.\nChisholm posits as a fundamental epistemic principle that if one is\njustified in believing herself to be perceptually appeared to as if\np, then one is prima facie justified in believing that\np. The significance of insisting that this principle is\nfundamental is to insist on the legitimacy of the move from\np-appearance to p-reality while denying that that\nlegitimacy is derived from deduction or abduction. \nTo the classical foundationalist, this move seems illicitly ad\nhoc. Admittedly, it gives the answer we desire—that\nperceptual beliefs are justified—but it doesn’t explain\nhow this can be so or give us any reason to think it is true (Fumerton\n1995). The objection holds that the postulation of fundamental\nepistemic principles licensing the inferences we like, despite our\ninability to provide an argument for the legitimacy of such\ninferences, has, to use Bertrand Russell’s apt phrase, all the\nadvantages of theft over honest toil. \nThe coherentist, like the classical foundationalist, endorses the\nMetaevidential Principle but holds that we can indeed have good\narguments for the reliability of perception. Coherentism is the view\nthat at least some justification comes from mutual support among\notherwise unsupported beliefs instead of tracing back to basic\nbeliefs. As such, coherentists are sometimes said to endorse certain\nkinds of circular (they prefer to call them holistic) argument, but a\ncoherentist will reject the Reasons Claim by insisting that there is\nnothing viciously circular about our arguments for the reliability of\nperception (BonJour 1985, Lehrer 1990). Because it allows mutual\nsupport, coherentism can tolerate empirical arguments for the\nreliability of perception, in principle, allowing appeals to track\nrecords, evolution, and other scientific evidence. \nCoherentism has traditionally been propounded as a doxastic theory:\none that holds that only beliefs can serve as evidence. This is in\npart because one of the major motivations for coherentism derives from\nan argument due to Wilfrid Sellars (1956), Donald Davidson (1986) and\nLaurence BonJour (1980) that purports to show that nondoxastic states\n(e.g., experiences) cannot play an evidential role (about which, more\nbelow, in\n section 3.4.1).\n This doxasticism is the source of one of the most notorious problems\nfor coherentism, however, for the internal coherence of a belief\nsystem could result from the ingenuity of the believer, rather than\nfrom its fit with reality. A detailed enough and cleverly constructed\nfairy tale could be highly internally coherent, but surely I am not\njustified in believing the fairy tale, in my current situation and\nenvironment. This is the famous isolation objection to\ncoherentism: a belief system could be isolated from the world and yet\nbe fully coherent. Since those beliefs would not be justified,\ncoherence is not sufficient for justification. \nThe brunt of the isolation objection is that (doxastic) coherentism is\nunable to do justice to perception, for it does not require any\ngenuinely perceptual contact with the world. But without perception,\nthe whole of one’s beliefs is just another plausible story, not\nthe one true description of things. (Even with perception, there is\nunlikely to be a single best belief set, but the number of\nequally good contenders will be vastly reduced.) For some time,\nBonJour (1985) thought that the problem could be solved with more\nbeliefs; he required a candidate belief system to include a number of\nbeliefs attributing reliability to beliefs that seem to be\ninvoluntary, noninferential, and directly caused by the outside world.\nBut this solution seemed ad hoc, and it still didn’t\nrequire the belief set to be very highly constrained by perception; at\nbest it constrained the belief set by what the agent believes\nto be perception, and even then, only those putatively perceptual\nbeliefs about which she has favorable metabeliefs would need to\nconstrain the rest of the system in any way. This seems to render\nperception epistemically “optional”, in an objectionable\nway. \nAlthough BonJour (1997) has consequently abandoned this approach in\nfavor of a form of foundationalism, others have sought to incorporate\nexperiences into a nondoxastic coherentism (Conee 1988, Haack 1993,\nKvanvig 2012, Kvanvig & Riggs 1992). If experiences are among the\nrelata over which the coherence relation is defined, then a fully\nisolated agent won’t be able to satisfy the coherence\nrequirement, and the isolation objection may be averted. \nIt is unclear whether such a move genuinely rescues coherentism or\nsimply replaces it with a version of foundationalism. If consonance\nwith experience can increase the credibility of a belief, then it\nbegins to look as if that belief satisfies at least some\n(“weak”) foundationalist definitions of an\nepistemologically basic belief. Instead, the nondoxastic coherentist\nmight insist that experiences justify perceptual beliefs, but only in\nthe presence of the right background beliefs about which experiences\nreliably indicate which distal states of affairs, where these\nbackground beliefs are themselves justified in a coherentist manner\n(Gupta 2006). This view seems to be securely coherentist, though it\nthreatens to render coherence with experience optional in just the way\nBonJour’s older view did. The crucial question here is whether\nexperiences—alone, and in and of themselves—affect the\ncoherence of a belief system, or whether they do so only in the\npresence of the relevant metabeliefs. If the former, then\n“nondoxastic coherentism” may not be significantly\ndifferent from some form of foundationalism. If the latter, then an\nagent lacking the requisite metabeliefs might satisfy the coherence\nrequirements quite well but have a belief system that clashes with her\nexperience, and the nondoxastic coherentist would have to hold that\nshe is none the worse, epistemically, for that fact. \nThe very spirit of coherentism seems to dictate that perception yields\njustification only because and insofar as the perceiver has\nmetabeliefs that favor perception, while it is central to the\nfoundationalist theory of perception that perceptual experience\nimposes epistemic constraints on us, whether we believe it or not. \nThe epistemological views considered so far can all be considered\negoistic theories, for they hold that justification for\nbeliefs about external objects depends in part on justification for\nbeliefs about oneself—about one’s current mental states,\nabout the connections between one’s experiences or putatively\nperceptual beliefs and certain distal states of affairs, rendering\nperceptual beliefs nonbasic. Modest foundationalism is a\nnonegoistic version of foundationalism, one that allows some beliefs\nabout external objects and their properties—particularly,\nperceptual beliefs—to be epistemologically basic. (Both types of\nfoundationalism also countenance other basic beliefs, e.g., beliefs\nabout simple arithmetical truths.) Modest foundationalism thus denies\nthe Metaevidential Principle; perceptual beliefs are not based on\nother beliefs and thus not based on appearance beliefs, and if they\nare based on something other than beliefs (namely, experiences) the\nagent need not have a justified belief about the reliability of this\nconnection. \nSome proponents of modest foundationalism go a step further and offer\na derivative denial of the Reasons Claim: since we already have\njustified beliefs about our surroundings, and introspective knowledge\nof the deliverances of perception, we can construct non-circular\narguments for the reliability of perception. Indeed, if I can have\nfirst-order knowledge about the world around me without first having\nmetaevidence about the reliability of perception, I should be able to\naccumulate empirical evidence for thinking that I am not a brain in a\nvat, that I am not dreaming, etc., without begging the question.\nWhether this should count as a virtue or a vice of the theory is a\nmatter of debate. Proponents of a “Moorean” response to\nskepticism (see the entries on\n skepticism\n and\n epistemic closure)\n will see this as a selling point for modest foundationalism (Pryor\n2000). Others (Vogel 2000, 2008; Cohen 2002) have interpreted this\nresult as revealing a fundamental flaw of the theory: it makes\njustification and knowledge “too easy”. It is as if I used\nan untested speedometer to form beliefs both about my speed and what\nthe meter indicated my speed to be, then used a number of such belief\npairs to inductively argue for the reliability of the speedometer. \nModest foundationalism endorses epistemological directness\n (section 2.1.5\n above) and could be considered a kind of epistemological direct\nrealism, for it makes the world and its elements “directly\npresent” to the mind in a fairly clear, epistemological sense:\nperceptual justification is not dependent on any other justification;\nno other beliefs are interposed between us and the world (in fact,\nJohn Pollock’s term for his [1986] modest foundationalism is\n“direct realism”; cf. Pollock & Cruz 1999). Modest\nfoundationalism is compatible with any metaphysical view about the\nnature of perception. Even a sense-datum theorist could embrace this\nepistemological direct realism, provided she held that the inference\nfrom sense-data to external objects was a kind of (perhaps unconscious\nor subpersonal) inference that does not impose evidential requirements\non the conclusion belief. \nModest foundationalism is usually associated with the internalist\nversions of the theory. Roughly, epistemological internalism is the\nclaim that the factors that determine justification supervene on the\nmental states of the cognizer (mentalism) or can be determined to\nobtain by mere reflection (access internalism; see the entry on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n Internalist modest foundationalist theories hold that perceptual\nbeliefs are directly justified by the corresponding perceptual\nexperiences; it is the experiences themselves, rather than beliefs\nabout the experiences, that do the justificatory work. \nThe most straightforward version is one that holds that having a\ncertain experience is by itself sufficient for prima facie\njustification for the corresponding perceptual belief. Michael\nHuemer’s (2007) “phenomenal conservatism”, James\nPryor’s (2000) “dogmatism”, and Pollock’s\n(1974, 1986) “direct realism” all endorse something like\nthe following principle: \nIf S has a perceptual experience as of p, then S\nis prima facie justified in believing that p. \nThat is, S is prima facie justified whether or\nnot perception is reliable for S and whether or not\nS has any evidence in favor of the claim that perception is\nreliable. Perceptual beliefs are justified by the experience alone, in\nvirtue of some intrinsic feature of that experience (its content, or\nphenomenal character, or assertive force, etc.). Of course, because\nthe justification here is only prima facie justification,\nthis justification could be defeated if, say, S has good enough\nreason to think that perception is unreliable, or has independent\nevidence that p is false. \nTo have a neutral term, I call this view “seemings\ninternalism”, for it holds that perceptual beliefs are\nbased on “seemings”, i.e., appearance states, i.e.,\nexperiences. (There is no fixed, established terminology here, so I\nwill use these terms interchangeably.) \nPerhaps the most important problem for this view concerns the relevant\nunderstanding of seemings, or perceptual experience. It is clear that\nseemings must be non-belief states of some sort, as their\nepistemological role is to confer justification on basic beliefs, and\nthe latter wouldn’t be basic if seemings were themselves\nbeliefs. The “Sellarsian dilemma” is a famous argument,\ndue perhaps as much to BonJour (1978, 1985) as to Sellars (1956),\nwhich claims that “experience” and “seemings”\nand the like are ambiguous in a way that undermines the\nepistemological role foundationalism requires of experiences. That\nrole, of course, is to provide justification for beliefs without being\nthemselves in need of it. (Sellars’s original argument is aimed\nat classical foundationalism, but I discuss it here, because it\nthreatens any theory that has experiences justifying beliefs—by\nthemselves and in the absence of background beliefs—and because\nmost recent discussion of the Sellarsian dilemma occurs within the\ncontext of seemings internalism.) According to Sellars (1956), there\nis a kind of awareness of sensations that does not involve learning or\nthe application of concepts, but this kind of awareness does not\naccount for the justification of our appearance beliefs; one might\nwell have this kind of awareness without having any idea what kind of\nexperiences one is having (or any idea that there are such things as\nexperiences!). There is another kind of awareness of our sensations\nthat does involve the application of concepts and does entail\nknowledge and justification. But this awareness just is\none’s knowledge of one’s experiences (i.e., one’s\njustified, true, unGettiered appearance belief). But that kind of\nawareness cannot then serve as a nondoxastic foundation that confers\njustification on beliefs without being itself in need of\njustification. \nSellars himself (1956) thought that there are two elements to\nperception: a bare sensation, which is an inner event with qualitative\ncharacter but no representational content; and a perceptual belief (or\nbelief-like state, in cases where the agent does not accept\nappearances at face value; see Reid 1764, 1785 for a similar view).\nRecent formulations of the Sellarsian dilemma have focused on this\nmismatch in content between experience and perceptual belief. There\nare several variants of the argument; what follows is an amalgamated\nversion. \nIn defense of\n (2),\n experiences have frequently been construed as lacking\nrepresentational contents altogether (Sellars 1956, Martin 2002,\nBrewer 2011), or as having nonconceptual contents (Heck 2000, Peacocke\n2001).[4]\n An influential argument (e.g., McDowell 1994, Brewer 1999) holds that\nwithout conceptual content, an experience would have to stand outside\nthe “logical space of reasons” and thus cannot justify a\nbelief. This line is perhaps most plausible if the relevant mode of\njustification is assumed to be a specifically evidential one\n(see\n section 3.1.1\n above). To serve as evidence, the experience would need to stand in\nlogical or probabilistic relations to beliefs, and without\n(conceptual) contents, it is unclear how it could stand in evidential\nrelations to beliefs, or which beliefs it would serve as evidence for\n(McDowell 1994). A common response is that as long as experiences have\ncontents of any sort, they can have truth conditions and thus stand in\nentailment and probabilistic relations to beliefs (Heck 2000, Byrne\n2005). One way to follow through on the original argument for\n (2)\n is to emphasize the kind of content necessary for evidence\nappreciable as such by the perceiver. If experiences are\nnonconceptual, then it seems that I could have a nonconceptual\nexperience of a cat without being in any position to appreciate the\nfact that the experience is in fact of a cat. In such a case, I could\nfail to have any justification for believing that there is cat in\nfront of me. So nonconceptual experiences cannot, by themselves,\njustify perceptual beliefs (Lyons 2016). Such an argument requires the\ncontroversial assumption that an agent must “appreciate”\ne’s evidential significance vis-à-vis h, in\norder for e to supply that agent with evidence for h.\nSome (e.g., Alston 1988) have explicitly rejected this assumption. \nAs for the other horn of the dilemma, premise\n (3),\n one can argue that so-called “experiences” that have\nassertive force and the same contents as beliefs are, if not\nthemselves beliefs, at least sufficiently belief-like that\nthey are susceptible to epistemic evaluation in much the way that\nbeliefs are; if so and if only the “justified” ones can\nconfer justification on beliefs, then these experiences will not have\nfilled the role foundationalism had carved out for them (Sellars 1956,\nBonJour 1978, Sosa 2007). \nIn recent years, several authors (Lyons 2005, 2009; Bengson, Grube,\n& Korman 2011; Brogaard 2013) have argued that what we think of as\nperceptual experiences is actually a composite of two (or more)\ndistinct elements, what Chris Tucker (2010) calls the\n“sensation” (an imagistic state, rich in perceptual\nphenomenology) and a “seeming” (here construed as a purely\nrepresentational state, applying conceptual categories to things in\nthe world). Seemings understood in this way are still non-belief\nstates: in cases of known perceptual illusion, it might seem to me\nthat p, even though I don’t believe that p.\nSomething like the above Sellarsian dilemma can be run with this\ndistinction in hand: sensations without seemings are insufficient to\njustify beliefs; and seemings without sensations would be subjectively\ntoo similar to mere hunches to justify beliefs (Lyons 2009). The\nseemings internalist can reply by arguing that seemings alone, even\nconstrued as just one component of perceptual experience, can indeed\njustify beliefs (Tucker 2010), or by rejecting this composite view,\ninsisting that a seeming is a single, unified state, whose perceptual\nphenomenology and conceptual content are inextricably linked (Chudnoff\n& Didomenico 2015). \nSeemings internalism as formulated above claims that the content of\nthe experience is the same as the content of the belief, thus\nrejecting premise\n (3)\n of the Sellarsian argument. There may be variations close enough to\nstill count as seemings internalism that deny\n (2)\n instead, allowing experiences with nonconceptual contents to justify\nbeliefs. The standard schema would have to be modified: \nIf S has a perceptual experience as of p*, then\nS is prima facie justified in believing that\np. \nOne would, of course, want to say more about the relation between\np and p*. Although his concern is not with nonconceptual\ncontent, Nico Silins (2011) defends a view much like seemings\ninternalism, where the experiences are not required to have the same\ncontents as the beliefs. \nA second problem is that of alien sense modalities (Bergmann 2006).\nThere are possible creatures with sense modalities and experiences\nthat are foreign to us: echolocation, electeroception, etc. If\nmetaevidential beliefs are not necessary for perceptual justification,\nthen these same experiences ought to justify us in those same\nbeliefs. Intuitively, however, a sudden electeroceptive experience\nwould not justify me in believing there was a medium sized animal\nabout three feet behind me. In fact, a famous objection that is\nnormally pressed against reliabilist theories seems to apply equally\nwell to seemings internalism. Norman (BonJour 1980) has no reason for\nthinking that he has clairvoyant powers, but one day he has a\nclairvoyant experience as of the president being in New York;\nintuitively, he is not prima facie justified in believing\nthat the president is in New York, yet seemings internalism seems to\nimply that he is. One might argue that Norman’s experience is\nnot exactly perceptual; perhaps this might offer a way out. Some\nversions of seemings internalism restrict their claims to perception\n(Pryor 2000), although some (Huemer 2007) apply to seemings much more\ngenerally. \nAnother potential problem is that seemings internalism is insensitive\nto the etiology of the experience, where it intuitively seems that\nthis should matter. If the only reason Jack looks angry to Jill is\nthat she has an irrational fear that he would be angry, then her\nperceptual experience as of angry-Jack should not carry its usual\nevidential weight (Siegel 2011). In general, experiences that result\nfrom wishful thinking, fear, and various irrational processes should\nnot have the same evidential import as do experiences with a more\nrespectable etiology (Siegel 2013). But seemings internalism makes the\nexperience itself sufficient for (prima facie) justification\nand thus leaves no role for etiology to play. One response to these\nsorts of cases is that if it genuinely looks to Jill as if Jack is\nangry, then the only appropriate thing for Jill to do is believe that\nhe is angry (Huemer 2013). This is compatible with there still being\nsomething else epistemically wrong with Jill; e.g., she presumably\ndoesn’t know that Jack is angry (even if he is). \nA question that arises for any epistemology of perception but that is\nmore salient for seemings internalism concerns which perceptual\nbeliefs are epistemologically basic. Is my belief that there’s a\ndog in front of me basic, or does its justification depend on the\njustification of more elemental beliefs: that there’s a medium\nsized, 3-dimensional object of such-and-such a shape and a furry\ntexture, etc.? Is my belief that that’s Django on the floor in\nfront of me basic, or does it depend on the beliefs that there’s\na black and tan dog of a certain description, and that Django is a\nblack and tan dog who fits that description, etc.? One reason this\nmatters, especially for the present views, is that it is closely\nlinked to separate issues concerning the contents of perception\n (see the entry on the \n  contents of perception).\n If I can have the basic perceptual belief that Django the dog is here\nin front of me, then does this mean that I must be capable of having a\nperceptual experience with the content that Django is in front of\nme? \nA final worry for seemings internalism is one that we encountered\nabove in\n section 3.2:\n the proposal seems to be an ad hoc attempt to get the\ndesired nonskeptical answer without further justification for the\n principle.[5] \nThere is a nonstandard form of internalist modest foundationalism that\nmight be able to solve some of these problems by finding a distinctive\nrole for background knowledge to play. Peter Markie (2006) suggests\nthat background knowledge of how to form perceptual beliefs can\ndetermine which experiences count as evidence for which beliefs. If\nthis background served as evidence, the view in question would no\nlonger be a modest foundationalism. Markie, however, understands this\nknow-how entirely in nondoxastic terms—in terms of behavioral\ndispositions. This presumably keeps it from serving as evidence,\nalthough the know-how is mental and available to introspection, which\nrenders the theory internalist. On this view, the content of\nperceptual experiences would not matter, for their status as evidence\nis not supposed to be determined entirely by the nature of themselves\nand their justificanda. This view does, however, flout the intuitively\nplausible, though controversial, principle of evidence\nessentialism, which holds that if e is evidence of\nh for S, then necessarily, e is evidence of\nh for any S (Lyons 2009; Pollock 1986 calls the\nprinciple “cognitive essentialism” and Conee & Feldman\n2004 call it “strong supervenience”). It also violates the\nplausible and less controversial claim that evidential relations are\nobjective (Bergmann 2004), i.e., that the agent’s subjective\nsense of evidential fit is insufficient for genuine fit. \nSeemings internalism employs a conception of seemings that is neutral\nbetween hallucination and veridical perception. The view thus holds\nthat our epistemic status is the same in both cases, as do coherentism\nand classical foundationalism. The epistemological disjunctivist, on\nthe other hand, holds that we are more justified in the good case\n(perhaps significantly more justified). \nThe debate between epistemological disjunctivists is actually\northogonal to the debates between foundationalism and coherentism. The\ndisjunctivist need not endorse modest foundationalism and hold that\nperceptual beliefs are basic. I discuss the theory here under the\nheading of modest foundationalism, because proponents of\nepistemological disjunctivists have typically embraced a version of\nmodest foundationalism, at least with respect to perception. \nEpistemological disjunctivism fits naturally with metaphysical\ndisjunctivism, although neither implies the other. The proponent of\nboth can claim that the reason we are justified in the good case but\nnot in the bad is that a veridical perceptual experience is a distinct\ntype of mental state from a hallucination and that different types of\nmental states frequently have different evidential significance. An\nepistemological disjunctivist who denied metaphysical disjunctivism\nwould claim that we are in the same mental state in both cases but\nthat the justificatory potency of an experiential state is partly\ndetermined by further factors, including the veridicality or not of\nthe experience. On the standard mentalist understanding of\ninternalism, the latter view is clearly externalist; the former view\nmight count as internalist, at least on a rather unusually liberal\nunderstanding of internalism, which allows the supervenience base for\njustification to include factive mental states. \nOne motivation for epistemological disjunctivism is that it would\nallow for a kind of infallibilism in perception: in the good case, the\nbasis for my perceptual belief is something that absolutely guarantees\nthe truth of that belief (McDowell 1982, Pritchard 2012). At the same\ntime, it does so in a way that is compatible with a (somewhat unusual)\nkind of access internalism (Pritchard 2012): in the good case, my\nexperience justifies me not only in believing, say, that there’s\na cat in front of me, but also in believing that I’m perceiving\nveridically. This allows me, at least in the good case, to know on the\nbasis of mere reflection that I’m in a state that infallibly\nguarantees that there is a cat in front of me. I cannot, however, know\nwhether or not I am in a state that guarantees that\nthere’s a cat. Because veridical and hallucinatory experiences\nare indistinguishable, epistemological disjunctivism implies that even\nif one can know that she does have good (infallible) evidence for\np in the good case, one might yet fail to know that she lacks\ngood evidence for p in the bad case, where she would continue\nto think she had good evidence. This brand of access internalism is\nunlikely to satisfy most internalists (Smithies 2013). \nOther versions of epistemological disjunctivism (not all of which\nembrace the title) are motivated differently. Some are motivated by\nthe idea that what justifies a perceptual belief that p is the\nfact that one sees that p (Millar 2011, Byrne 2016),\nsome by the idea that all evidence consists of facts (Williamson\n2000), and some by the idea that veridical involves a successful\nexercise of a capacity while the hallucinatory case does not\n(Schellenberg 2016). \nCoherentism and classical foundationalism attempt to satisfy the\nMetaevidential Principle in a way that allows these theories to (a)\ndefend, rather than simply postulate, the epistemic legitimacy of\nperception, and (b) satisfy the internalist demand that the factors\nrelevant to the justification of a belief be internal to the agent.\nInternalist modest foundationalism does (b) but not (a); externalist\nversions do (a) but not (b). (Both reject the Metaevidential\nPrinciple.) Although it is possible to defend an externalist\nepistemology that is otherwise structurally similar to classical\nfoundationalism or coherentism (Goldman 1986), extant externalist\ntheories have followed modest foundationalism in allowing beliefs\nabout external objects and properties to be epistemologically\nbasic. \nExternalist theories impose more (and also sometimes less) than the\nseemings internalist requirement that the agent have the relevant\nperceptual experience. One obvious candidate factor is reliability.\nAlvin Goldman (1979, 1986) argues that, so long as perception really\nis reliable,[6]\n the agent need not have reasons for believing perception to be\nreliable in order to be justified in her perceptual beliefs. What\nmakes perceptual beliefs justified, on such a view, is that they are\nreliably formed. The simplest reliabilist theory of perceptual belief\nis one that holds \n(SR): a belief is prima facie justified iff it is the result\nof a reliable cognitive process. \nThis offers a nonevidentialist theory of perceptual justification;\nrather than being justified by evidential connections to experiences\nor other beliefs, it is the mere fact that the producing or sustaining\nprocess has a tendency to yield true beliefs that makes the perceptual\nbelief justified. This is not to say that it precludes evidence from\nplaying any epistemic role but only that it does not require evidence\nfor perceptual justification; an agent can have justified perceptual\nbeliefs without having any evidence. \nA second externalist approach can be offered either as an alternative\nor an addendum to reliabilism. It holds that what makes certain\nbeliefs about the world justified is that they have a distinctive\npsychological etiology, e.g., that they are the outputs of a\nperceptual module (where what counts as a perceptual module is spelled\nout in architectural terms, rather than in terms of phenomenology or\nthe agent’s background beliefs; Lyons 2009). Psychological\netiology is not available to mere reflection, and the theory leaves\nopen the possibility that the agent has a justified perceptual belief\nwith the requisite perceptual etiology, without having any conscious\nexperiences or evidence of any other kind. Obviously, the lack of an\nevidential requirement will be controversial, but the proponent of\nthis view sees this as little more than the externalist had already\nsigned on for. \nA third possibility is to claim that what makes perceptual beliefs\njustified is that they are properly formed, where the operative\nconception of “proper” is cashed in terms of a\nbiological—usually evolutionary—understanding of proper\nfunction. Again, this can be offered either in conjunction with\n(Plantinga 1993) or in opposition to (Bergmann 2006, Graham 2012)\nreliabilism. \nMany of the objections to these views are just specific applications\nof objections to reliabilism, externalism, and teleological theories\nmore generally. For instance, clairvoyance objections (BonJour 1980)\naim to show that reliability is not sufficient for prima\nfacie justification, and new evil demon arguments (Lehrer &\nCohen 1983) insist that reliability is not necessary\n (see the entry on reliabilist epistemology).\n Teleological theories face the additional problem of the Swampman\n(Davidson 1987), who is a randomly occurring (therefore, lacking in\nany biological functions) molecular duplicate of a normal person;\nintuitively he seems to have justified perceptual beliefs, although\nthis cannot be accounted for in terms of proper function. \nIn addition to these standard worries, there is a pervasive sense\namong epistemologists that perceptual experiences must play some\nimportant role in the justification of perceptual belief, probably an\nevidential one. There are two ways to make room for experiences in an\nexternalist epistemology. One is to add an auxiliary thesis to the\neffect that the requisite external property is essentially mediated in\ncertain cases by experiences. For example, some perceptual processes\nmight only be highly reliable when experiences are among the inputs;\nor they might be designed (Plantinga 1993) to take experiences as\ninputs. The other way is to defend a genuinely hybrid account, which\nposits an internalist (usually evidentialist) constraint that is not\ntaken to reduce to the more general external criteria already in\nplace. \nAn example of this second approach is Alston’s (1988)\ninternalist externalism. He requires that every justified belief have\nsome ground, or evidence, and that this ground be accessible; that is\nthe internalist element. He claims, however, that what makes a ground\n(good) evidence for some belief is that the ground reliably indicates\nthe truth of that belief, and this fact is one that need not be\naccessible to the agent; this is the externalist element. Juan\nComesaña (2010) endorses a similar view, though in ostensibly\nprocess reliabilist terms (the processes he has in mind, however, are\nvery narrow, of the form “believing h on the basis of\ne”, which makes it more similar to an indicator\nreliabilism than a typical process reliabilism). Goldman (2011) wants\nexperiential evidence to play a central role in perception, though he\ndoes not explicitly endorse an experiential/evidential requirement. He\noffers a two-factor reliabilist proposal for understanding evidence,\nwhich combines process and indicator reliabilism; for e to be\nevidence for h (i) e must be among the inputs to a\nreliable process that outputs h, and (ii) there must be an\nobjective fittingness relation between e and h, that is,\ne must reliably indicate the truth of h. \nThese theories understand evidential justification in terms of\nreliability. One could alternatively understand it in teleological\nterms (Plantinga 1993) and couple this with a requirement that every\njustified perceptual belief be based on some appropriate experiential\nevidence (although teleological theories tend not to take this extra\nstep). Either way, we get a theory that solves some of the Sellarsian\nproblems for seemings internalism. The reliability or teleology can\ndetermine which experiences serve as proper evidence for which\nbeliefs, and it shouldn’t matter whether experiences have the\nright kind of content, or any content at all. The external factor thus\nplays roughly the same role as internalized know-how does for\nMarkie’s view. Like Markie’s view, externalist theories of\nperceptual evidence violate evidence essentialism, but unlike that\nview, they retain the objectivity of evidence, even if the\nteleological views see it as species-relative. \nOf course, such hybrid theories will still be unsatisfying to\ninternalists. Even if they require certain internal factors for\njustification, they still leave the total determinants of\njustification outside the agent’s ken. Some experience of mine\nwill count as evidence for some belief of mine, but it is an utter\nmystery to me which belief the experience is evidence for. This will\nnot satisfy the internalist, at least not the sort who thinks that if\nwe are justified in believing something, then this is a fact we can\nascertain on the basis of mere reflection. At the same time,\nnonevidentialist externalists are not likely to see what is compelling\nabout the experiential requirement, especially if it doesn’t go\nfar enough to appease internalist scruples anyway. \nThe epistemological problems of perception have traditionally centered\non the threat of skepticism, in particular, on the “veil of\nperception” implicated by a well-known metaphysics of\nperception, which threatens to lead inexorably to skepticism. Although\ncertain metaphysical theories of perception have natural affinities\nfor certain epistemological views, the epistemology and metaphysics\ntend to be logically independent. Even once our metaphysics is in\nplace, we will need to make difficult decisions about the\nepistemology. There is a wide variety of direct realist\nepistemological theories of perception and a number of\nnon-direct-realist epistemologies as well, each boasting certain\nstrengths and facing problems yet to be solved.","contact.mail":"jclyons@uark.edu","contact.domain":"uark.edu"}]
