These discussions have\na long and venerable history. They are also of lively contemporary\ninterest.\n\n\nThe reason for this long-standing and continued interest is\nstraightforward. How one sees God’s relationship to time has\nrepercussions throughout philosophy of religion and philosophical\ntheology. How much and in what ways does God’s relationship to\ntime, and thus his nature, differ from ours? How much can meaningfully\nbe said about what God is like, as opposed to how God is not? How, if\nat all, can an unchanging God interact with the world, affect history,\nor respond to petitionary prayer? And even, how should one think of\nthe relation between science and theistic religion; can empirical\nfindings (dis-) confirm theism? Thus, a conception of how God relates\nto time is a defining element of any conception of God.\n\n\nThis entry provides an overview of some key positions on God and time\nand discusses arguments for and against divine timelessness. The final\nsection outlines some other philosophical contexts in which\nthe concept of eternity can play a role.\n\n\n\n\n“Theism” will here refer to the view that there is a God\nwho is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent, who created the\nworld, and who is still actively involved in the world. \nIn philosophical discussions about God and time, the term\n“eternity” has been used in different ways. On one usage,\nwhich will be followed here, “eternity” stands for the\nrelationship to time that God has, whatever it is. When used in that\nway, the term is neutral between different ways of spelling out what\nGod’s relationship to time is. Western theists agree that God is\neternal; the task is to formulate and assess conceptions of what this\neternality might amount to. \nBroadly speaking, there have been two rival views of what God’s\neternality consists in. On the first, God is timeless (divine\ntimelessness); on the second, God is in time (divine temporality).\nSometimes the term “eternity” is used to denote\ntimelessness, but as mentioned, we will here use it as neutral between\nthe timeless and temporal views. The term “everlasting”\n(or “sempiternal”) on the other hand, is mostly associated\nwith the temporal view. On the temporal view, God is in time and thus\nexists at every time; there is no time at which God doesn’t\nexist. \nThis discussion inherits the complexities of two very intricate\nphilosophical debates (about God, and about time). Given the nature of\nthe topic, it is perhaps not unreasonable to wonder what methodology\ncan be fruitfully employed here. \nAs the topic is the God of Western theism, there are constraints\narising from relevant passages in Western Scripture. Much of the\ndiscussion focuses on the Judeo-Christian, especially the Christian,\ntradition. (But note that specific Christian doctrines such as the\ndoctrine of the Trinity or the Incarnation, while closely related, are\nnot the focus here.) The Bible contains many\npassages calling God eternal, as well as ones that elaborate on\nGod’s eternality. For example, there are passages telling us\nthat God’s “years have no end” (Ps. 102:27, all\nquotations are from the New Revised Standard Version) and that God\nexists “from everlasting to everlasting” (Pss. 90:2,\n103:17). God says, “let there be lights in the dome of the sky\nto separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for\nseasons and for days and years” (Gen. 1:14), and “I am the\nfirst and I am the last” (Isa. 44:6). Moreover, we are told that\nGod promised us eternal life “before the ages began”\n(Titus 1:2), and that “He himself is before all things”\n(Col. 1:17). These passages require interpretation, and that’s\nwhere the philosophical work begins (see, e.g., Leftow 2005 for a\nformulation of constraints based on these passages). \nOne broad methodological choice concerns whether or not to let\none’s theological commitments determine one’s views about\nthe metaphysics, or even the physics of time. A salient alternative\nwould be to do the opposite, for example by taking as one’s\nstarting point the metaphysical view of time suggested by our best\nphysical theories and then drawing out any theological implications. A\nthird approach might involve giving equal weight to both poles and\nseeking to come to a coherent and adequate conception of both time and\nGod as part of the same endeavor. There probably exist a variety of\nstances across the philosophical and theological landscapes (for\nexplicit reflection on related methodological questions see, e.g.,\nMurray & Rea 2008: 47; Mullins 2016: Ch. 1). \nUntil recently, the timelessness view dominated in both philosophy and\ntheology. For that reason, much of the historical discussion revolves\naround that view. \nThe loci classici are to be found in Book XI of the\nConfessions of Augustine (354–430) and Book V of\nBoethius’s (480–c.525) The Consolation of\nPhilosophy. (The extent to which the Platonism of Philo of\nAlexandria [c. 25 BCE–CE 40], particularly as applied to the idea\nof creation [for example, in his De opificio mundi] was\ninfluential, is not clear.) However, the styles of these two thinkers\nare very different. Boethius presents the idea of timeless eternity as\nstraightforward and relatively problem-free. Augustine wrestles with\nthe idea and expresses continual puzzlement at the idea of time itself\nand with it the contrasting idea of timeless eternity. \nIn Boethius, the contrast is between timeless eternity, which only God\nenjoys, and everlastingness, which (following Plato) the world itself\npossesses. \nIt is the common judgement, then, of all creatures that live by reason\nthat God is eternal. So let us consider the nature of eternity, for\nthis will make clear to us both the nature of God and his manner of\nknowing. Eternity, then, is the complete, simultaneous and perfect\npossession of everlasting life; this will be clear from a comparison\nwith creatures that exist in time. \n…for it is one thing to progress like the world in\nPlato’s theory through everlasting life, and another thing to\nhave embraced the whole of everlasting life in one simultaneous\npresent. (Boethius Consolation, V.VI., transl. V. E. Watts\n1969) \nBoethius uses his view of eternity to address the problem of divine\nforeknowledge (see\n section 6.2).\n If God knows beforehand what we will do then how can we act freely?\nHis answer is that this problem dissolves in the face of the fact that\nGod does not know anything beforehand but has an immediate, atemporal\nknowledge of all things. \nIn Boethius, we find several analogies for timeless eternity. One is\nthat between timeless eternity and the centre of a circle. The thought\nis that the centre bears the same relation to any point on the\ncircumference of the circle, and in the same way timeless eternity\nbears the same relation to anything in time. (Aquinas develops this\nanalogy later.) Another analogy is that between God’s timelessly\neternal vision and someone at the summit of a hill taking in at a\nglance what is taking place beneath her. \nAugustine connects God’s timeless eternity to God’s being\nthe cause of all times and God’s immutability. \nWhat times existed which were not brought into being by you? Or how\ncould they pass if they never had existence? Since, therefore, you are\nthe cause of all times, if any time existed before you made heaven and\nearth, how can anyone say that you abstained from working? (Augustine,\nConfessions, XI. xiii (15)). \nIt is not in time that you precede times. Otherwise you would not\nprecede all times. In the sublimity of an eternity which is always in\nthe present, you are before all things past and transcend all things\nfuture, because they are still to come. (Augustine,\nConfessions, XI. xiii (16)). \nIn you it is not one thing to be and another to live: the supreme\ndegree of being and the supreme degree of life are one and the same\nthing. You are being in a supreme degree and are immutable. In you the\npresent day has no ending, and yet in you it has its end: “all\nthese things have their being in you” (Rom.11.36). They would\nhave no way of passing away unless you set a limit to them. Because\n“your years do not fail” (Ps.101.28), your years are one\nToday. (Augustine, Confessions, I. vi (10)) \nAs mentioned, Boethius finds the source of his conception of eternity\nin Plato. In the Timaeus (37E6–38A6) Plato contrasts\nthe eternal forms with the time-bound created world, the world of\nchange and becoming. Time was created along with the heaven\n(38B5)—meaning at least that time is the measure of change, and\nperhaps that it is identical with the movements of the heavenly bodies\n(a view later critiqued by Augustine (Confessions, Book XI.\nxxiii)). Plato’s idea of eternity in the Timaeus seems\nto be that of a timeless duration. The Forms endure in the temporal\norder in which “time is the moving image of eternity”. One\ncan trace a similar idea of timeless eternity back to Parmenides\n(though exactly what he means is the subject of scholarly\ndispute). \nWhile (in some places at least) Plato connects the necessary character\nof the Forms to timelessness, in Aristotle the connection is between\nnecessity and everlastingness. What is necessary is what exists at all\ntimes. What is contingent is what at some time is not. God, being\nnecessary, is everlasting. It may be said that the everlasting is not\nbounded by time (though it is unbounded in a weaker sense than Plato\nascribes to the Forms) in that what exists everlastingly cannot age\n(Physics 221b30). Philo of Alexandria is thought to be the\nfirst to ascribe timelessness to God, to the God of the Jewish\nScriptures. In Plotinus (ca. 185–254) timelessness and life are\nfor the first time identified. Nous is eternal and beyond\ntime, enjoying duration without succession. \nAnselm (c. 1033–1109) presents a view similar to that of\nBoethius and Augustine. \nSuppose, on the other hand, that it exists as a whole in individual\ntimes severally and distinctly. (A human being, for instance, exists\nas a whole yesterday, today and tomorrow.) In this case we should,\nproperly, say that it was, is and will be. In which case its time-span\nis not simultaneously a whole. Rather it is stretched out in parts\nthrough the parts of time. But its time-span is its eternity and its\neternity is precisely itself. The supreme essence, therefore, would be\ncut up into parts along the divisions of time. (Anselm,\nMonologion, Ch. 21) \nFor Anselm, the timeless eternity of God follows from God’s\nbeing that than which nothing greater can be conceived (cf.\n section 6.1).\n In the Proslogion, Anselm articulates a\n“grammar” of the divine powers, which determines what it\nmakes sense to say of the most perfect being, including that\nbeing’s timelessness. \nIn the medieval period, the discussion embraces not only Christian but\nalso Jewish and Islamic thinkers. In keeping with the sharp line drawn\nbetween the Creator and creation, Aquinas and the Jewish thinker Moses\nMaimonides (1131–1204) (who greatly influenced Aquinas) argue\nthat God’s timeless eternity ought to be understood primarily in\nnegative terms. For Aquinas, God’s timeless eternity is\nunending, lacking both beginning and end, and an instantaneous whole\nlacking succession. It is a correlate of divine simplicity (see the\nSEP entry on\n divine simplicity),\n and it is incapable of being defined or fully grasped by a creature.\nFor Aquinas too, timeless eternity constitutes part of the\n“grammar” of talking about God. Since God is timelessly\neternal it does not make any sense to ask how many years God has\nexisted, or whether he is growing old, or what will he be doing later\non in the year. \nDespite differences with Thomas Aquinas regarding the nature of\nGod’s relation to time, Duns Scotus (c.1266–1308) seems to\nhave upheld divine timelessness (though see Leftow 1991: 228). In\ngeneral, it would seem that commitment to divine simplicity,\nwidespread if not universal in the medieval period, entails a\ncommitment to divine timelessness (Mullins 2016: Ch. 3). \nIt has recently been suggested that there are actually two orthogonal\nissues regarding God’s relationship to time: (1) whether God is\nlocated in our spacetime—the spacetime investigated by modern\nphysics; and (2) whether God is eternal or everlasting. (Note that\nthis is the terminology not employed here.) God could be eternal, with\na life that’s not marked by temporal succession, while being\nlocated at every spacetime point. Conversely, God could be everlasting\nwhile not located in physical spacetime at all (Murray & Rea 2008:\nCh. 2). \nAt first sight, this distinction can seem to leave the second issue\nsomewhat mysterious: if it is not being located in our, physical\nspacetime, then what is it? What can it mean to say that an entity is\neverlasting, or exists at all times, if that doesn’t commit one\nto a view on whether that entity is located in spacetime? What then\nare times—are they not somehow to be understood in terms of\nspacetime, ultimately? \nBut there are two distinct issues in the vicinity. One is about\nGod’s life, or, for want of a better phrase, the nature of\nGod’s experience. Whether or not a being experiences succession,\nand more generally, what the (a)temporal features of its experience\nare, is distinct from whether or not that being is located in\nspacetime. \nHowever, there are also connections between these issues. The beings\nwe are most familiar with, such as ourselves, are spatiotemporal and\nexperience temporal succession; and for us, these facts are related.\nIt is partly because we are located in spacetime that we experience\nsuccession, and there are interesting questions about the details of\nthis connection. \nThis section outlines some views on God and time, with a focus on the\ncontemporary literature; further reading suggestions appear at the end\nof this section. Each view may involve claims both about whether God\nis located in time/spacetime, and about (a)temporal features of\nGod’s experience. Specifically, timelessness views may involve\nboth the claim that God is not located in time/spacetime, and the\nclaim that God’s life is atemporal, for example in the sense\nthat God doesn’t experience succession. Similarly, temporal\nviews may involve both the claim that God is in time/spacetime and\nthat God’s life is temporal, for example in the sense that God\nexperiences succession. \nOn this view, God is not located in time and God’s life does not\nhave any temporal features. This is a natural first gloss of the\ntimelessness position. However, few defenders of divine timelessness\nsign up to this view. It has been suggested that Maimonides and\nSchleiermacher may hold it (Leftow 2005; actually, the view Leftow\nattributes to these authors is that God has no “typically\ntemporal properties” (TTPs); see the end of\n section 4.1.3). \nBoethius has strongly influenced the contemporary landscape. Much of\nthis influence flows through work by Eleonore Stump and Norman\nKretzmann (hereafter S&K 1981, 1987, 1992). \nRecall Boethius (Consolation, V.VI., here in a different\ntranslation, by Stewart et al. 1973): “Eternity […] is\nthe whole, simultaneous, and perfect possession of boundless\nlife”. Or again, eternity is the complete possession all at once\nof illimitable life. \nStump and Kretzmann distill four ingredients from this claim. \nNot only does a timeless being not experience succession, but its\nlife’s events don’t involve succession. Since change\nrequires succession, a timeless being doesn’t change. But a\ntimeless being is still presently alive in some sense of\n“presently”. Moreover, the events in that being’s\nlife are simultaneous in some sense, both with each other and with\ntemporal items. \nTo show how, Stump and Kretzmann coin the notion of Eternal-Temporal\nSimultaneity (“ET-simultaneity”). First, define an\n“eternal present” to be an infinitely extended, pastless,\nfutureless duration (strictly speaking, on the terminology used here,\nit should be “timeless present”). Then let Temporal\nSimultaneity (“T-simultaneity”) be existence/occurrence at\nthe same time, and let Eternal Simultaneity\n(“E-simultaneity”) be existence/occurrence at the same\neternal present. Each involves only one mode of existence, namely\neither the temporal or the eternal. ET-simultaneity, by contrast,\nrelates items in different modes of existence, one temporal, and one\neternal. \nStump & Kretzmann base their definition of ET-simultaneity on\nnotions borrowed from some presentations of special relativity: \nLet “x” and “y” range over\nentities and events. […] \n(ET) For every x and every y, x and y are\nET-simultaneous if and only if: \nThey also offer the following image. Imagine two parallel horizontal\nlines. The lower line represents time, and the upper one represents\ntimeless eternity. Presentness is represented by light. The temporal\npresent is represented by a light that moves steadily along the lower\nline, while the eternal present is represented by the upper line being\nlit all at once. Each dot in the lower line, when it is temporally\npresent, is ET-simultaneous with the whole of the upper line. Or at\nleast this is so from the viewpoint of that time. From the viewpoint\nof eternity, the entire lower line is lit up; each time “insofar\nas [it] is temporally present” is ET-simultaneous with the whole\nupper line (S&K 1992: 475). \nSince, by definition, two items can only be ET-simultaneous if one is\ntemporal and the other eternal, and since any given item is only one\nof these, ET-simultaneity is not reflexive; in fact, it never holds\nbetween an entity and itself. Nor is it transitive; in fact, when\nx and y are ET-simultaneous and y and z\nare too, x and z never are. The non-transitivity of\nET-simultaneity is needed to solve a pressing problem. If t is\nsimultaneous with eternity, and eternity is simultaneous with \\(t'\\),\nthen t is simultaneous with \\(t'\\). So, all times collapse into\none: \nBut, on St. Thomas’ view, my typing of this paper is\nsimultaneous with the whole of eternity. Again, on his view, the great\nfire of Rome is simultaneous with the whole of eternity. Therefore,\nwhile I type these very words, Nero fiddles heartlessly on. (Kenny\n1979: 38–9) \nThe Stump & Kretzmann proposal has generated much discussion. Here\nare three questions that have been raised. \nFirst, is the notion of an atemporal duration coherent? (See\nFitzgerald 1985; also Craig 1999; Nelson 1987; Helm 1988: 35.) What\nlicenses speaking of a duration here? The eternal present is supposed\nnot to be pointlike, but to involve an infinite stretch or extension\nof some kind. This suggests that it should possess some of the formal\nfeatures of extension. For example, it should be possible for two\nparticulars to have the same or different amounts of the extension. If\nthis is not the case with atemporal duration, then how is it a\nduration? And if it is the case, then how is it not a temporal\nduration?  A proponent of this view may insist that such features are not\npossessed by atemporal duration, because such features are had only if\nthe extension in question is divisible (S&K 1987, 1992). And the\neternal present is not. In support of this, they may suggest that not\neven all temporal extension is divisible. Consider our temporal\nexperience on short time scales and the doctrine of the\n“specious present”. On that doctrine, temporal experience\ninvolves a temporally extended content. Perhaps this is not even\nconceptually divisible, even though it’s a temporal extension\n(S&K 1992: 468). The comparison is particularly apt if one wants\nto think of the eternal present as God’s specious present\nencompassing all of time (Alston 1984, also Leftow 1991: 143; though\nsee Oppy 1998, in Other Internet Resources, for a critique of this\nidea). \nMoreover (they may add), even if all temporal extension is divisible,\nthis doesn’t show that all extension is. Pressed to justify\ntheir use of the term “extension” and explain its\nconnection to ordinary usage, they point to other cases in theology of\nirreducibly analogical predication (see Rogers 1994 for objections to\nthis move). \nSecond, what can it mean for something eternally present to observe\nsomething as in the temporal present, and vice versa?  (See Lewis\n1984; also Nelson 1987; Padgett 1992: 69; Swinburne 1993.) Suppose\nsomething eternal observes something as temporally present. If that\nmeans it observes something that comes to be, then doesn’t the\nobservation itself come to be, making the being temporal? Conversely,\nhow can a temporal entity observe something as being eternal? How can\nit observe anything without bringing that thing into the temporal\nseries? After all, the event of x’s observing y\nat t is identical with the event of y’s being\nobserved by x at\nt. \nConsider this revised definition of ET-simultaneity: \nDoes this provide an answer to the objection, or does it rely on one?\nAs pointed out by Brian Leftow in a similar context (Leftow 1991: 173;\nalso Fales 1997), on the view proposed, the temporal and the eternal\ncan enter into causal relations only if they are in some sense\nsimultaneous. That is the reason ET-simultaneity is invoked. If one\nthen relies on a notion of ET-causality in the definition of\nET-simultaneity one faces a problem of circularity. \nThird, what role, if any, is special relativity playing in the\nproposal? The intended role is a considerable one. Considerations of\nthe relativity of simultaneity are supposed to show that the\ndifficulties with the notion of ET-simultaneity are “by no means\nunique” and “cannot be assumed to be difficulties in the\nconcepts of ET-simultaneity or of eternity themselves” (S&K\n1981: 439). But it is hard to see how they could show this. Stump and\nKretzmann emphasize the finding that simultaneity is a three-place\nrelation and present it as a response to a threat of incoherence (two\ndistant events being both “simultaneous […] and not\nsimultaneous” (S&K 1981: 437)).  But the difficulties with\nET-simultaneity arise whether it is two-place or three-place. They\npertain to spelling out what an eternal present and the unique eternal\nframe of reference might be, and how there can be causal relations,\nincluding observational ones, between a being in it and us. No\ncomparable difficulties are involved in special relativity (Fales\n1997; also Padgett 1992: 71; Craig 2009). \nFor Brian Leftow, the central idea is that all things in time are\nalso, with God, in timeless eternity. He finds this idea in Anselm.\nLike in the Stump and Kretzmann proposal, the idea is given a\ncontemporary twist through appeals to the notion of a reference frame\nand special relativity. \nConsider the claim that God has no spatial location. Since there can\nbe a spatial distance only between things or locations in space, this\nimplies that there is no spatial distance between God and things in\nspace. From this, Leftow infers that the distance between God and any\nthing in space is zero (the “Zero Thesis”) (Leftow 1991:\n222). \nThe Zero Thesis says not only that the distance between God and any\nspatial thing is zero, but also that it always is zero. Therefore\nnothing ever moves with respect to God. Moreover, all change\nsupervenes on motion, e.g., change in color supervenes on motion in\nmicroparticles. So there is no change with respect to God (Leftow\n1991: 227). Therefore, God and all spatial things share a frame of\nreference, the reference frame of eternity, in which nothing changes.\nIn this reference frame, all events are simultaneous, including\nGod’s actions and their effects. That is, they all occur at\neternity, and eternity is something like another time, so they are all\nsimultaneous. But in other, temporal reference frames, this is not the\ncase. In these, God’s actions occur at eternity but their\neffects occur at particular points in time. So in these frames, they\nare nonsimultaneous. And this is where special relativity comes in.\nAfter all, the relativity of simultaneity shows that events\nsimultaneous in one frame of reference may be nonsimultaneous in\nothers.  Unfortunately, the Zero Thesis and Leftow’s case for it are\nproblematic. From the fact that there is no spatial distance between\nspatial things and God, it does not follow that the spatial distance\nbetween spatial things and God is zero. A similar inference leads one\nto claim that all spatial things are spatially contiguous with yellow\nand the number 3. Leftow is of course aware of this consequence, and\naccepts it as a surprising finding about yellow and the number 3; he\nargues that the Zero Thesis only seems problematic because one fails\nto notice that a distance of zero is just an absence of distance\n(Leftow 1991: 225). However, a distance of zero would seem to be a\ndistance, not an absence of distance (Oppy 1998, in Other Internet\nResources). \nAs before, it’s hard to see how talk of reference frames and\nappeals to the relativity of simultaneity can be helpful or even\nrelevant. A reference frame is a system of physical devices such as\nmeasuring rods and clocks that allow an observer to fix the positions\nof events. It’s not clear how timeless eternity can be such a\nsystem. Nor is it clear how timeless eternity can, in addition, be\n(like) a time, simultaneity with which can be the outcome of\nmeasurements. \nBefore turning to further elements of Leftow’s view, it is\nuseful to pause to describe some background on the metaphysics of time\n(see also the SEP entries on\n time,\n John M.E. McTaggart, and\n being and becoming in modern physics).\n McTaggart distinguished between the A-series and the B-series of\nevents. The A-series runs from the future through the present and into\nthe past, while the B-series runs from earlier to later (McTaggart\n1908). This distinction survives in the form of the contemporary\nopposition between the B-theory and (various versions of) the A-theory\nof time. \nAccording to the B-theory (tenseless theory, block universe view), (a)\nall times and/or events exist and are equally real (this is known as\neternalism—not to be confused with divine timelessness which has\nalso sometimes gone by the same name); and (b) there is a complete\ntenseless description of temporal reality. A tenseless description is\none that stays accurate, because it mentions only such things as which\nevents happen when, and how they are temporally related to one\nanother. So it mentions only facts about B-relations like simultaneity\nand succession. Call these tenseless facts. The B-theory combines\neternalism with the claim that there is a complete description of\ntemporal reality, a description of temporal reality at its most\nfundamental, that doesn’t mention any tensed facts, like that\nit’s 12:00 now. \nOpposed to this are various versions of the A-theory, which deny one\nor both of (a) and (b). What these A-theoretic views (including\neternalist and non-eternalist ones, like presentism or the growing\nblock view) have in common is that they metaphysically privilege one\ntime. Fundamental tensed facts capture this privilege. One prominent\nmotivation for the A-theory is the conviction that time passes\n(robustly—i.e. in a sense that goes beyond mere B-theoretic\ntemporal succession (see Skow 2015: 2); in what follows that’s\nwhat I mean by “temporal passage”). As time passes, the\ntensed facts change: first it’s a fundamental fact that\nit’s 12:00, then that it’s 12:01. \nNow return to Leftow’s view. Let A-occurring be occurring now,\nand let B-occurring be occurring at a certain temporal location\nt that is now. (This is intended to be continuous with\nMcTaggart’s distinction.) B-occurring entails A-occurring: if\nsomething occurs at a temporal B-location t that is now, it\noccurs now. But not vice versa. Something can occur now without\noccurring at a temporal B-location t that is now. Something\ncan, that is, A-occur without B-occurring. Now define A-simultaneity\nas occurring “at the same now”. B-simultaneity, by\ncontrast, is having the same temporal B-location in some B-series. If\ntwo events are B-simultaneous and they B-occur (i.e. they are located\nat the same B-temporal location that is now), they are A-simultaneous.\nAnd if two events occur at the same atemporal now and A-occur (i.e.\noccur now), they are also A-simultaneous. \nThe upshot is that  \nthe A-simultaneity that obtains between a timeless God and temporal\nentities is univocal with the A-simultaneity that obtains between\ntemporal entities. (Leftow 1991: 239)  \nThis would make the relation between temporal entities and the\ntimeless God less mysterious than it is on the Stump & Kretzmann\nproposal, on which ET-simultaneity is sui generis, obtaining only\nbetween one temporal and one eternal relatum. \nBut this seems to be an advance that was gained by stipulation,\nbecause the discussion started thus: “[L]et us so understand\n“now” that occurring now does not entail having a position\nin a B-series of earlier and later events. That is, let us in effect\ntake “now” and “occurring now” as primitive\nterms univocally applicable to temporal and eternal or timeless\nthings” (Leftow 1991: 239). It’s not surprising that given\nthis initial stipulation, the ensuing definitions allow one to say\nthat the A-simultaneity that obtains between temporal entities is the\nsame relation that obtains between a timeless God and temporal\nentities. \nAccording to Leftow, there can be no change in (timeless) eternity,\nand in eternity, all events happen (A-) simultaneously. However, in\nsome places eternity is instead described as involving succession,\nnamely as consisting of a number of different B-series corresponding\nto different temporal reference frames (Leftow 1991: 239). Prima\nfacie, these are different, incompatible ideas. B-theorists, who\nhold that time, fundamentally, consists of events standing in\nB-relations of precedence and simultaneity, do not also hold that all\nof time collapses to a single time. \nThis is relevant to the notion of Quasi-Temporal Eternality (QTE,\nLeftow 1991: 120–2). Unlike Stump & Kretzmann, Leftow holds\nthat atemporal duration, understood as QTE, involves distinct points\nbut not parts. These points are (at least in some sense) earlier and\nlater than one another, but they do not stand in the relation of\nsuccession. This seemingly paradoxical claim is partly defended via\nappeals to the B-theory. The idea is that Boethian eternity is like an\nextension in B-time, and that a QTE being’s life contains\nearlier and later points with no succession between them. In this\nrespect, we are told, it is like life in B-time, only without an\nillusion of temporal passage. \nThere is a danger here of misinterpreting the B-theory. While the\nB-theory doesn’t posit temporal passage, it does posit\nsuccession. Relatedly, the traditional project of squaring our\ntemporal experience with the B-theory is about explaining away an\nillusion of temporal passage, not about explaining away an illusion of\ntemporal succession (see the SEP entry on the\n experience and perception of time).\n Since the B-theory posits succession (a B-relation), an experience of\nsuccession is non-illusory, on the B-theory. This makes trouble for\nLeftow’s appeals to the B-theory. After all, Leftow holds that a\nQTE being’s life, in which all times are experienced at once, is\nwhat a non-illusory experience of B-time would be like (Leftow 1991:\n122). In other words, the thought is that an experience of temporal\nsuccession is illusory, on the B-theory. \nLeftow also suggests that the sense in which QTE involves earlier and\nlater points is not a temporal one, but a logical one. However,\nlogical priority is not temporal priority, nor is it relevantly like\ntemporal priority (Rogers 1994: 11). \nA more recent idea is that of a typically temporal property (TTP). A\nproperty is a TTP if a term predicating it is “part of a\ndefinition of being temporal or figures appropriately in the right\nsort of nondefining sufficient condition for being temporal”\n(Leftow 2002). The right sort is for example “necessarily,\nwhatever is past was temporal” rather than “necessarily,\nwhatever is a pig is temporal”. The thought is that just like\nbeing bipedal helps make us human without being sufficient for making\nus human, so, e.g., being present helps make things temporal without\nbeing sufficient for making things temporal (and so there can be an\ntimeless eternal present a la Boethius). \nIn recent times, there has been a notable shift away from divine\ntimelessness. There are many different kinds of views that fall under\nthe heading of divine temporality; many of these could also be\nclassified as “intermediate” views. As in 4.1, the list is\nof course far from exhaustive. \nOn this view, God is located at all times, God experiences succession,\nand God has lived through and will live through a non-finite past and\nfuture. The idea here is that God is in (our, physical)\ntime/spacetime, and God is a temporal being in just the way we are,\nexcept that the temporal extent of God’s life is infinite.\nCompared to other temporal views, this one is conceptually\nstraightforward. Arguably, however, it is in tension with current\ncosmology, which suggests that the universe has a finite past. Insofar\nas the view implies that God is bound by, or has no power over time,\nit may also be at odds with some of the constraints arising from\nWestern Scripture (see\n section 2).\n The view is found at least in process theologians like Charles\nHartshorne (Hartshorne 1947). \nOn Alan Padgett’s view, God changes, so God is temporal.\nHowever, timelessness is not abandoned; instead, it is redefined.  \n[…] I have not abandoned timelessness. Instead, I have\nredefined “God is timeless” to mean that God is relatively\ntimeless, i.e. he is not measured by time nor is he affected by the\nnegative aspects of temporal passage. (Padgett 1992: 146; also 2001)\n \nThe idea is that God’s time is non-identical with our,\n“Measured Time”. \n“Measured Time” is “the specifically human time of\nour history and our universe: the time of seconds, days, and\ncenturies; the time of our space-time” (Padgett 1992: 130). In\nthat sense of “time”, God is timeless. However, God is not\ntimeless in the strict sense in which “time” refers to any\nkind of temporality, because God is in his own time. Does that mean\nGod is only in his time and not in ours? No, he is in our time too (p.\n131—at least saying this is “philosophically\nacceptable” (p. 126)), as we are in his. It’s just that he\ntranscends our time. What does it mean to transcend our time? It means\nthat God is the ground of time, that he is not negatively affected by\nthe passage of time, and (things get a little circular here), that he\nis relatively timeless. \nOne question one might have about this is what “Measured\nTime” and “God’s time” are, and how plausible\nit is to think there are both. Padgett maintains that in everyday\nspeech, “time” refers “not to an ontological\ncategory” but to “the human time of our history and our\nuniverse” (1992: 130). The distinction is supported by appeals\nto the differences between this sense of “time” and\n“the strict ontological sense of ‘time’ used in\nphilosophy” (p. 140). But this may still leave one wondering\nabout the distinction. For one thing, few contemporary ontologists\ntake themselves to be investigating a time distinct from “the\nhuman time of our history and our universe”. Nor do they tend to\nthink of the time of the universe as specifically human. For another,\nthere are a number of different philosophical views about time. \nWilliam Lane Craig’s view is that God is timeless without\ncreation, and temporal with creation (Craig 2000). God exists\ntimelessly “without” creation rather than before creation,\nbecause there isn’t literally a before. And so it can’t\nliterally be the case that God becomes temporal, since becoming\nanything involves being first one thing and then the other.\nNonetheless, God is “timeless without creation and temporal\nsubsequent to creation ”, God “enters time at the moment\nof creation” (Craig 2000: 33). God exists changelessly and\ntimelessly, but by creating, God undergoes an extrinsic change\n“which draws Him into time” (Craig 2000: 29). \nThe problem is that even extrinsic change still presupposes a before\nand after (Leftow 2005: 66). Craig is aware of the difficulty:  \n[O]n such a view, there seem to be two phases of God’s life, a\ntimeless phase and a temporal phase, and the timeless phase seems to\nhave existed earlier than the temporal phase. But this is logically\nincoherent, since to stand in a relation of  earlier than  is by all\naccounts to be temporal. (Craig 2000: 32)  \nHis solution is  \nthat “prior” to creation there literally are no intervals\nof time […] no earlier and later, no enduring through\nsuccessive intervals and, hence, no waiting, no temporal becoming.\nThis state would pass away, not successively, but as a whole, at the\nmoment of creation, when time begins.  \nAnd this state, he says, “looks suspiciously like a state of\ntimelessness” (Craig 2000: 33). \nBut this solution looks suspiciously like a re-statement of the view.\nThe problem was that we could only talk of a “before” in\nquotation marks. Yet we needed there to literally be such a before on\nthe view in question. (This is unless we decline to make literal sense\nof all this, but that is not Craig’s approach.) What can it mean\nto say God underwent a change at the end of which God was temporal?\nCraig’s answer seems to be that there is timelessness before\ntime’s beginning, or rather, “before” time’s\nbeginning. \nCraig endorses Padgett’s distinction between “Measured\nTime” and “Ontological Time” (God’s time).\nUnlike Padgett, he identifies the latter with Newton’s absolute\ntime. He defends a “neo-Lorentzian” interpretation of\nspecial relativity, according to which there is a privileged reference\nframe that is in principle undetectable due to the effective Lorentz\ninvariance of the dynamical laws. In addition, he points to the cosmic\ntime of some general relativistic spacetime models as a candidate for\nabsolute time. Each of these claims is made in support of a strong\nprior commitment to the A-theory, shared with Padgett. However, each\nclaim faces problems, and their connection is unclear, since the\n“neo-Lorentzian” approach to special relativity\ndoesn’t allow for as natural a development in the direction of\ngeneral relativity as does the standard approach (see, e.g., Balashov\n& Janssen 2003, Wüthrich 2013). \nCraig and Padgett differ over whether cosmic time gives a\n“proper measure” of God’s time, and thus effectively\nover whether, on this kind of view, we have any epistemic access to\nGod’s time (which we are also in). Craig answers in the\naffirmative, but still hesitates to identify cosmic time with\nGod’s time, preferring instead to say that the two\n“coincide” (Craig 1990: 344). \nRichard Swinburne originally defends timelessness (Swinburne 1965),\nbut then switches allegiance to a temporal view. According to his\nlater view, before creation God lives alone in a metrically amorphous\ntime (Swinburne 1977, 1993, 1994). (Padgett also describes God’s\ntime as metrically amorphous.) Once God creates the world and\ninstitutes the laws of nature, time acquires a metric. There then\nbegin to be facts of the matter about how long temporal intervals\nare. \nFurther Reading:  \nRecall that the theistic God is omniscient. Presumably then, God knows\nwhat temporal reality is like at its most fundamental. If there are\nfundamental tensed facts (like that it’s 12:00), God knows them.\nBut since these facts change, what God knows changes constantly. So\nGod changes constantly; so God is in time. \nArgument 1 \nTherefore, if the A-theory is true, then God is temporal. (From (4),\n(5), (6), (7)) \nVarious versions of this argument have been defended (Craig 2000,\n2001; DeWeese 2004; Hasker 2002; Kretzmann 1966; Padgett 1992, 2001;\nWolterstorff 1975; Mullins 2016: Ch. 4). Since many participants of\nthe debate think the A-theory is true, it is treated as an argument\nfor divine temporality. In response, advocates of timelessness\nchallenge one or more of the argument’s premises (Wierenga 1989,\n2002; Alston 1989a; Ganssle 1993, 1995, 2002). Others respond by giving up\non the A-theory and accepting the B-theory (Helm 1988, 2001; Rogers\n2000). The thought is that this argument can’t be run for the\nB-theory, since on the B-theory, the fundamental (tenseless) temporal\nfacts don’t change. The parallel argument would get stuck at the\nanalogue of step (5): it’s not the case that if God knows\nfundamental tenseless facts, then what God knows changes. So while the\nargument itself is silent on whether the B-theory allows one to\ncombine timelessness with omniscience, part of the point of making it\nis that the parallel argument can’t be run for the B-theory. \nOne might, however, wonder whether there are arguments in the vicinity\nof Argument 1 that can be run on the B-theory too. Consider first the\nfollowing, somewhat similar argument. \nArgument 2 \nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5′), (6), (7)) \nUnlike in the case of Argument 1, the connection to the A-theory here\nis not straightforward. There is certainly a sense in which (4′)\nis true on the B-theory, even though there is, on the B-theory, no\nchange in the fundamental temporal facts. At each time, that time is\npresent—not in the absolute, metaphysically privileged sense of\nthe A-theory, but in a relative, perspectival sense. Each time is\npresent at itself, just like each spatial location is here relative to\nitself. Moreover, on a standard B-theoretic account of tensed language\n(e.g., Mozersky 2015; but see Torre 2010 for an alternative account),\nat each of those times, a temporal subject S can know, and have\na true belief about, what time it is. At noon, S believes that\nit is noon; that belief is made true by a tenseless fact, such as that\nS holds the belief at (a time simultaneous with) noon. At\n12:01, S believes truly that it is 12:01, where this belief is\nmade true by another tenseless fact, such as that this later belief is\nheld by S at (a time simultaneous with) 12:01, and so on. \nAdmittedly, it is not the case, on this B-theoretic account, that knowing\nwhat time it is (at different times) involves knowing different things\nat different times. The reason is that the tenseless contents that are\nbelieved can be believed by S at all times equally (and typically\nwill be). So while, at each time, S has a tensed belief with a\ntenseless content that differs from the tenseless content of\nS’s tensed beliefs at previous times, S may not\ncome to believe, or know, anything new. This suggests that the same\napplies to God, and that (5′) doesn’t follow from\n(3′) and (4′). \nHowever, what matters is not just what S knows and\nbelieves, but how S knows and believes it. Tensed\nbeliefs have rather different cognitive significance from the\ncorresponding tenseless ones. What matters for timely action is\nbelieving the tenseless content via a tensed representation, by having\na true tensed belief (“it is noon (now)”). The point is a\nmore general one that applies equally to indexicals other than\n“now”, such as “I” or “here”: the\ncognitive significance of indexical beliefs differs from that of the\ncorresponding non-indexical ones. \nTherefore, if a B-theoretic subject S knows (at more than one\ntime) what time it is, then they undergo changes. The reason is that\nhow they believe what they believe changes. They need to keep track of\ntheir temporal perspective by having appropriately varied tensed\nbeliefs (“it’s noon”, “it’s\n12:01”). At least this is so for anyone whose temporal nature\nrelevantly resembles our own. Does this group include God? If so, then\non the B-theory too, there is reason to worry about the combination of\nomniscience with timelessness. \nArgument 3 \nTherefore, God is temporal. (From (5″), (6″), (7)) \nOne might reason as follows. When God creates the universe, God begins\nto stand in the relation of coexisting with to the universe,\nand also in the relation of sustaining it in existence.\nAcquiring these and other relations to the universe makes God\ntemporal, because it constitutes a change that God undergoes at the\nmoment of creation. Even if God was timeless before, God is temporal\nafter creation (Craig 2009). \nThe problem with this line of thought is again that it is not clear\nhow to understand the notions of before and after, of acquiring, and\nof beginning, as applied to a timeless God. \nHowever, the point can be made in another way. God is thought to be\ncausally active in the world, where those causal relations include\nGod’s responding to petitionary prayer and being actively\ninvolved in world history. Similarly, God coexists with the world and\nsustains it in existence at every moment. God loves, and knows about\nthe lives of, God’s creatures. All these are relations. God\nstands in causal and other relations to a temporal world.\nDoesn’t this make God temporal (Mullins 2016, Ch. 5)? \nEach version of divine timelessness tries to address this concern in\nsome way. One somewhat radical response, given by Aquinas and others,\nis that while the world is related to God, God is not related to the\nworld. \nSuppose that whatever is a person does at least some of the following:\nremembering, anticipating, reflecting, deliberating, deciding,\nintending, and acting intentionally. If timelessness precludes one\nfrom doing any of these, then being timeless is incompatible with\nbeing a person. Since God is a person, God is not timeless. \nBut is it the case that being a person requires one to do at least\nsome of the above? Instead one might hold that at most, it requires\none to be capable of doing at least some of the above. And\nperhaps a timeless God is capable of doing some of the above, even if\nGod does not do them. \nAlternatively, one might question the grounds for thinking that these\nactivities tend to be precluded by timelessness. It is true that they\nall seem to involve change, namely a change in one’s mental\nstates. But defenders of timelessness may think we should leave room\nin our conceptual scheme for a timeless, changeless version of each of\nthese activities (Craig 2009; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch. 2). \nThere are a number of considerations speaking in favor of divine\ntimelessness that arise out of perfect being theology. Perfect being\ntheology is the approach to theology that involves figuring out what\nGod is like on the basis of God’s being the most perfect (or\ngreatest possible) being. A general argument goes as follows. The most\nperfect being, God, has the most perfect mode of existence. But\ntemporal existence is a less perfect mode of existence than timeless\nexistence. Therefore, God has a timeless mode of existence. \nWhy think that temporal existence is less perfect than timeless\nexistence? Note that we’re here mostly concerned with the second\nissue distinguished at the beginning of\n section 4,\n namely the nature of God’s experience (rather than the first,\nnamely whether or not God is located in time/spacetime). The thought\nis that ordinary temporal experience involves gain and loss, and an\nawareness of the inescapable passage of time. Relatedly, for ordinary\ntemporal beings, neither the distant past nor the future are\nperceptually accessible. We remember parts of the past, but\nimperfectly, and we merely anticipate the future. We know much less\nabout the future than the past. We can’t change or re-experience\nthe past, nor can we skip ahead to later moments, except one at a\ntime. \nBut then again, God is no ordinary temporal being. The defender of\ntemporality can reply that while God’s life has temporal\nfeatures, in that God experiences succession, God’s temporal\nexperience is otherwise very much unlike ours (Mullins 2014). For\nexample, God is omniscient, so God forgets no part of the past and\nalready knows all about the future. It’s true that experiencing\nsuccession means experiencing things one at a time. But, the defender\nof temporality might add, this very feature is necessary for, e.g.,\nthe ability to enjoy music, which is good and therefore something the\nmost perfect being would have. \nThere are more indirect ways of arguing from perfection to\ntimelessness. For example, suppose that the most perfect mode of\nexistence involves immutability, and that immutability requires\ntimelessness. Or suppose that perfection requires divine simplicity,\nand that simplicity requires timelessness (for more, see the SEP\nentries on\n divine simplicity\n and\n immutability). \nOne line of thought is that complete knowledge of future contingent\nevents is impossible for beings in time. Since God is omniscient, and\ntherefore knows all that will happen, God is timeless. \nAnother line of thought is that while God is omniscient, and therefore\nknows all that will happen, some of our actions are genuinely free.\nBut these two facts are in tension with one another, and the tension\ncan be resolved by thinking of God as timeless. \nHere is this line of thought in more detail. First consider an\nargument for theological fatalism, the view that divine foreknowledge\nand freedom are incompatible (Pike 1965; Murray & Rea 2008: Ch.\n2). God is omniscient. So God knows all that is true and believes\nnothing false. Now consider the proposition p that you will\nread this section 1,000 years hence. Suppose p was true 1,000\nyears ago. Then God believed p then. And you never had a choice\nabout whether God believed p 1,000 years ago. Nor have you ever\nhad a choice about anything that follows from God’s believing\np 1,000 years ago, including that you read this section today.\nSo you never had a choice about whether you read this section today,\nwhich means you’re not doing it freely. \nOne proposed solution is to deny that p was true 1,000 years\nago. (Aristotle responds in this way to a similar, non-theological\nargument for logical fatalism.) For more on this solution, see the SEP\nentries on\n foreknowledge and free will\n and\n fatalism. \nA defender of divine timelessness may attempt another solution\n(inspired by Boethius). God is not located in time, so God does not\nknow or believe things at times. So it is not the case that God\nbelieved p 1,000 years ago. Rather, all temporal events are\nbefore God’s mind “at once”, or in an atemporal\npresent. However, some argue that a similar problem still arises\n(Zagzebski 1991: Ch. 2). \nGod is immaterial. Suppose it follows from this that God is not in\nspace. Then one might argue that relativity theory implies that God is\nnot in time either, because according to relativity theory, anything\nthat is in time is also in space (Leftow 1991: 272). \nWhile the basic thought is clear enough, one might worry about the\ndetails of this argument. In relativity theory, there are no such\nthings as times or spatial locations, at the fundamental level. So it\nwould be at least misleading to say that according to relativity\ntheory, anything that is located at times is located at spatial\nlocations. But a defender of the argument probably has in mind\nprecisely this implication of (special) relativity, that\nspatiotemporal regions are fundamental, because there is no unique\ndecomposition of spacetime into space at times. Presumably the lesson\nof relativity theory for the present debate can be suitably\nreformulated. \nFurther Reading on God and Time: Pike 1970; Braine 1988; Yates 1990;\nGale 1991; Mawson 2008;\nCraig 1998, 2001, 2009; Murray & Rea 2008; Leftow 2010; Tapp &\nRunggaldier 2011; Oppy 2014; Mullins 2016; and Ganssle (Other Internet\nResources).  \nBoth timelessness or atemporality, and permanence or everlastingness,\nare widely applicable concepts. This section outlines a few non-religious\nphilosophical debates in which the concept of eternity, in the sense\nof atemporality, can play a role (McDaniel 2016). \nConsider questions about the nature of propositions, mathematical\nobjects, or other abstracta. Perhaps these are atemporal entities,\nexisting outside of time/spacetime, and not standing in any\nspatiotemporal relations to other entities. What sorts of\nconsiderations might bear on whether they are or not? Take\npropositions, the true or false things sentences express. Take a\nsentence that changes its truth-value over time (e.g.,\n“It’s sunny”). Does such a sentence express\ndifferent propositions at different times (that it’s sunny at\n\\(t_1\\), that it’s sunny at \\(t_2\\), etc.)? Or does it express\nthe same proposition over time (that it’s sunny)? If it’s\nthe former, then the propositions expressed don’t themselves\nchange truth-value. If it’s the latter, the proposition (that\nit’s sunny) itself changes truth-value. In this latter case,\nthat might give one reason think that the proposition is located\nwithin time rather than outside of it. On the other hand, it might\nnot. After all, the truth-value also seems to vary with spatial\nlocation; yet we may be reluctant to infer from this that the\nproposition has spatial locations. \nAs another example, consider the view that time does not exist, for\nexample as argued for by speculative metaphysicians such as McTaggart\nor F. H. Bradley. On such views, everything is eternal (in the\nsense of atemporal). \nThe view that time is unreal was also argued for by Kurt Gödel on\nthe basis of general relativistic considerations (Gödel\n1949). Gödel’s starting point is his discovery of solutions\nto Einstein’s Field Equations that permit the existence of\nclosed timelike curves. Such spacetimes, he argues, do not contain a\ntemporal dimension, since time only exists if there is genuine passage\nof time, and there cannot be genuine passage of time in such\nworlds. This in turn suggests that time does not pass, and thus does\nnot exist, in the actual world either (for more on the argument see\nSavitt 1994; Dorato 2002; Yourgrau 2005). \nMore recently, some physicists and philosophers of physics working on\napproaches to quantum gravity have entertained the view that spacetime\nmay not be fundamental (see the SEP entry on\n quantum gravity).\n Of course, whether the concept of atemporality applies in this\ncontext depends on how the claim that spacetime is not fundamental is\nbest understood.","contact.mail":"nmdeng@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
