His life was devoted entirely to scholarship, and\nhis erudition was second to none in his, or perhaps any,\nperiod. Although much of what he wrote was embedded in technical\nreligious issues, for a century he was one the most widely read\nphilosophers. In particular, his Dictionnaire historique et\ncritique was among the most popular works of the eighteenth\ncentury. The content of this huge and strange, yet fascinating work is\ndifficult to describe: history, literary criticism, theology,\nobscenity, in addition to philosophical treatments of toleration, the\nproblem of evil, epistemological questions, and much more. His\ninfluence on the Enlightenment was, whether intended or not, largely\nsubversive. Said Voltaire: “the greatest master of the art of\nreasoning that ever wrote, Bayle, great and wise, all systems\noverthrows.”\n\n\nMore than for most philosophers, the circumstances of Bayle’s\nlife determined the shape, content and thrust of his work. Curiously,\naccounts nowadays of the lives of historical philosophers, usually\nwritten by philosophers for philosophers, often begin with this sort\nof statement, even though most philosophers otherwise write as if\ncircumstances were irrelevant. In the case of Bayle, however, the\nimportance of circumstances is undeniable, to the point that ignoring\nthem inevitably leads to distortion and misinterpretation. \nAn emblematic event in the life of Bayle was the Revocation of the\nEdict of Nantes in 1685, which from his point of view was an instance\nof grotesque intolerance based on moral and logical absurdity. The\ngreater part of his life’s work can be understood as\nBayle’s attempt to lay bare the absurdity represented by this\nevent. Nor was the significance of the event merely symbolic for\nBayle, since he himself was a victim of the intolerance to an extreme\ndegree. \nThe Revocation (as it came simply to be called, so momentous was it)\nmust be understood in the context of the general reformation of\nChristianity in the sixteenth century. Perceived ecclesiastical\nabuses, both moral and doctrinal, had led many to believe that such\nradical overhaul of Roman Catholicism was required that, in the end,\nseparation from Rome was often the result. The separation of the\nProtestants, as they were called, was generally based on political\npower, either of a majority or simply of those in a position to\nexercise it. In France, however, the situation was more complicated,\nbecause the Protestants, or Huguenots, were never more than about a\ntwentieth of the population. Even so, they had influence beyond their\nnumbers, and they took sides in a protracted political struggle that\nemerged as the civil Wars of Religion, one of the grisliest chapters\nin French history. After most of a century of death and upheaval, the\nFrench were ready for a settlement, which came about when the\nsuccession of the crown passed to the Protestant Henry of Navarre, but\non condition of his abjuration of Protestantism, i.e., conversion to\nCatholicism. “Paris is worth a Mass,” quipped the new\nHenry IV, who was then uniquely in a position to terminate the Wars of\nReligion, which he did with the Edict of Nantes (1598). This royal\ndecree recognized the rights of Protestants in at least certain\ndomains, but in terms that were far from fully favorable to Protestant\ninterests (for example, only Catholics were to be admitted to the\nuniversities). Moreover, Henry’s successors gradually chipped\naway at Protestant guarantees in a policy of persecution aimed, as\nthey saw it, at uniting the French state (un roi, une loi, une\nfoi—one king, one law, one faith). Finally, Louis XIV, the\n“Sun King,” abolished the Edict altogether, even though it\nhad been issued in perpetuity, on the ground that it was no longer\nneeded since there were no longer any Protestants. \nAmidst this mess, Pierre Bayle was born in 1647, the son of a\nProtestant minister in Le Carla (now Le Carla-Bayle), a small town in\nthe foothills of the Pyrenees. Typically, the family was financially\nimpoverished, and Pierre, after primary school, could be only\nhome-schooled until he was 21. Then, when his older brother had at\nlast graduated from the only place the family could afford at the\nProtestant school at Puylaurens, he left home for what soon became the\ncrossroads of his life. For within three months he had moved on to the\nJesuit school in Toulouse, where he abjured his Protestantism. His\nconversion was short-lived however, for he after graduating with a\nmaster’s degree he returned to the Protestant fold. Commentators\ndiffer on the significance of this episode. The interpretation in\nterms of venal self-interest seems mistaken, however. While\nBayle’s abjuration made him eligible for a Jesuit scholarship,\nhis re-conversion returned him to a state that was far worse, for in\nthe eyes of the authorities he was now not just a heretic, but a\nrelapsed heretic, liable to the severest of penalties. He therefore\nfled France for the Calvinist stronghold of Geneva. He went with the\nrenewed blessing of his family and the knowledge, given that both his\nchanges of religion were sincere, that errors of conscience could\noccur in good faith. \nA menial job of tutoring kept body and soul together in Geneva, but\nalso kept him from the scholarly life Bayle craved. He eventually\nslipped back into France for a position at the Protestant Academy at\nSedan, where he remained until its suppression by the government in\n1681. Eventually, he was given a position at the Ecole Illustre in\nRotterdam, a school for the community of Huguenot refugees there,\nwhose numbers increased dramatically after the Revocation. Despite\nstill-onerous teaching commitments, Bayle began his serious publishing\ncareer with works defending the French Reform from Catholic\npersecution and criticisms on many topics, but particularly on the\ndoctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the sacrament of the\nEucharist, which the Huguenots denied. Works from this period include:\nPensées diverses (1682), the Critique\ngénérale (1682), Nouvelles lettres (1685)\nand La France toute catholique (1686). The philosophical\nbasis for his argument against Catholic persecution appeared the\nfollowing year in the Commentaire philosophique, a classic in\nthe literature on toleration. \nBayle’s position on toleration was found inimical to the\nProtestant cause by his erstwhile friend and colleague from Sedan,\nPierre Jurieu, whom he had helped bring to the safety of Holland.\nJurieu, “the Theologian of Rotterdam,” soon became the\nbitterest enemy of Bayle, “the Philosopher of Rotterdam,”\nand the two engaged in long and caustic polemic that was neither\npositive nor productive in any sense. These were difficult times for\nBayle. His father and both brothers died within two years, one of the\nlatter while languishing in a French jail because of Bayle’s\npublications. He had also assumed editorship of one of the first of\nthe learned journals, Nouvelles de la République des\nLettres, the rigors of which contributed to his plight and the\nresulting breakdown he suffered in 1687. \nBayle’s life, and the subsequent course of intellectual history,\nwere dramatically altered by the publication of his Dictionnaire\nhistorique et critique, which began appearing in 1696. Certainly,\nBayle’s material situation was improved, not to mention that of\nhis publisher, since the work was soon on its way to becoming the\nphilosophical best-seller of the eighteenth century. Bayle was at last\nable to give up teaching. But what accounts for the success of this\nstrange work? It is not a dictionary in the usual sense; rather it is\na hodge-podge encyclopedia of intellectual curiosities, serious\nargument on a variety of topics, salacious stories, exacting textual\nscholarship, and much more that drew a readership hardly less diverse\nthan its contents. To be sure, its entries are alphabetically\narranged, but perhaps ninety-five percent of the work is to be found\nin the footnotes, called Ôremarks,’ that often bear little\nrelation to the main text. Readers obviously dipped here and there\ninto this massive work of over six million words, and had a wonderful\ntime. \nNot everyone was happy with the work, however. Unhappy were\nauthorities in France, of course, where the proscribed work\nnonetheless showed up, and the reactionary Jurieu, who mobilized the\nConsistory of the Walloon Church in Rotterdam against Bayle, who was\nthen constrained to publish Eclaircissements or\n“Clarifications” of his treatment of atheism, Manicheism,\nskepticism and obscenity. In addition to work for further editions of\nthe Dictionnaire, Bayle’s last years were spent in\ncontinued theological debate, now primarily with the Rationalist\ntheologians Le Clerc, Jaquelot, and Bernard. Bayle, whose health had\nnever been robust, died on 28 December 1706, probably of a heart\nattack precipitated by tuberculosis. He was putting the final touches\nto his Entretiens de Maxime et de Thémiste, the work\nwhich motivated Leibniz to write the only book he would ever publish,\nthe Theodicy. \nThere is a general problem in the interpretation of Bayle that has\nbeen acknowledged (and even insisted upon both by critics and\nadmirers) in the literature from his own time to the present. It is a\nproblem not just of deciding whether Bayle succeeded in what he was\ntrying to do, which would be difficult enough given the charged topics\nthat he often dealt with, but even and especially in deciding the\nnature of what he was trying to do. One might not go so far as to\nclaim that meaning is author’s intention (the so-called\nintentional fallacy), but it is hard to deny that author’s\nintention is at least relevant to meaning. And what Bayle’s\nintentions were has been a matter of debate from the beginning. \nAccording to just the twentieth-century interpretations, Bayle might\nhave been a positivist, an atheist, a deist, a skeptic, a fideist, a\nSocinian, a liberal Calvinist, a conservative Calvinist, a libertine,\na Judaizing Christian, a Judeo-Christian, or even a secret Jew, a\nManichean, an existentialist. To be sure, not all of these exclude the\nrest; for example, skepticism has often been associated with fideism.\nBut atheism, for example, is certainly incompatible with deism and the\nother forms of theism. Moreover, there is at least some plausibility\nto all of these interpretations. \nPerhaps one way of sorting out his cacophony is in terms of the\ndistinction that Bayle himself drew between two kinds of philosophers:\nthe lawyers, who represent their case in the best light possible and\ntheir opponents’ in the worst, and the reporters, who tell it as\nit is, with respect to all views. Bayle might be a reporter, equitably\nrelating all views, even those that are mutually inconsistent,\nespecially in the Dictionnaire, which is the work on which\nthe panoply of interpretations is largely based. When justifying\nhimself to the Walloon Church over the obscenities alleged to be found\nthere, he claimed not to be producing obscenities but only to be\nrelating, as a good historian must, what others had produced. Even so,\nsome of the views that he clearly purports to relate as a reporter are\nhis own, both in the Dictionnaire and especially in the whole\nrest of his work, which deals almost exclusively with religious\ntopics. And here there is a special problem of interpretation. \nA case can be made that the logic of Bayle’s various positions\non toleration, evil, truth, substance and accident, lead ineluctably\nto atheism; yet Bayle constantly asserts his belief in the tenets of\nthe Calvinist faith in which he was raised, and for which, not\nincidentally, he made such sacrifice. We are thus faced with an\ninconsistent triad: Bayle’s clearly articulated and acknowledged\nprinciples entail atheism; Bayle does not accept atheism; Bayle is\nneither stupid nor dishonest. He sees the incompatibility of the first\ntwo claims, but nonetheless makes them (that is, Bayle neither nods\nnor winks). \nFrom his own time to the present, it has been the third claim that has\ndrawn closest scrutiny. Given the stressful period of the Revocation\nand its aftermath, the possibility of a nodding (or even crazed) Bayle\nhas some plausibility. But it is a winking Bayle who came to be the\n“Arsenal of the Enlightenment.” Those looking to discredit\nreligion and theism generally had only to focus on what is most\nobvious, consistent and rationally cogent in his work. If there are\nalso claims there of Christian orthodoxy, they were taken as so much\nhand-waving dissimulation in an effort to slip the real message past\ncensorious authorities. Whatever his intentions, this impulse toward\nmodern atheism was Bayle’s greatest single influence. \nThis interpretation was another of the topics on which Bayle had to\ndefend himself before the Walloon Consistory. His defense in the\nEclaircissement, and in fact throughout his work, was an\nappeal to a fideism that seems to have made incompatibility with\nreason a condition for an article of faith. Certainly, Bayle asserts\nthat the value of faith is directly proportional with its repugnancy\nto reason. In this, Bayle was only pursuing a line to be found in\nScripture, especially St. Paul, whom Bayle cites repeatedly and at\nlength on the rational foolishness of faith in still another\nEclaircissement, on Manicheanism and the problem of evil.\nArguably, his is the only conception of faith that avoids the heresy\nof Pelagianism, according to which people are able to save themselves,\nindependently of divine grace. For if we can reason ourselves to the\ntruth (or even the probability, or plausibility) of what is believed\non faith, and such belief is a sufficient condition for salvation,\nthen, contrary to Calvinist doctrine, faith is not necessary. Of\ncourse, even this defense is open to the winking Bayle\ninterpretation. \nOne way to express the issue, at least, is with respect to\nBayle’s reaction to the horrors of the Revocation. The fact is\nthat after the death of his imprisoned brother, Bayle hardly ever\nagain referred to divine providence. This silence is remarkable for\none whose Calvinism dictated belief in strict predestination based on\nthe sufficiency and necessity of grace. What ought to have been a\nconsolation was ignored. Why? It might be that for him the Revocation\ncame to represent the hypocrisy, not just of Roman Catholicism, but of\nChristianity and all religion—hypocrisy being the very failing\ncondemned by the Gospel more than sins of the flesh or any other sin.\nThe issue is epistemologically underdetermined by its very nature, for\nBayle’s behavior was compatible with both atheistic\ndissimulation and sincere fideism. This issue is also morally idle\ngiven Bayle’s own view on toleration of dissenting belief,\nexpressed by the scriptural injunction, judge not. Only God\nhas the privileged access necessary to judge conscience. \nBayle has generally been regarded as a skeptic of some sort, but the\nsort has seldom been specified with any precision. Three kinds seem\nrelevant. The most influential kind has already been alluded to,\nnamely religious skepticism, which may be taken to mean that Bayle did\nnot in fact believe all, or perhaps any, of the religious views that\nhe asserted. The evidence for attributing such skepticism to Bayle\ncould hardly be stronger. Such beliefs are, according to Bayle,\ncontrary to reason. But the evidence against doing so is at least\nequipollent: Bayle claims, repeatedly and unequivocally, to be a\nbeliever. Those who take Bayle to be a religious skeptic discount this\ntestimony as dissimulation. What the motive for it would be is\nunclear. Fear of censorship is implausible; Bayle hardly lacked for\ncourage, and in any case did not have a great deal to fear in\nrelatively liberal Holland. Moreover, that Bayle should have foreseen\nthe skeptical influence he was to have on the Enlightenment credits\nhim with an unlikely prescience and deviousness, making him, to use\none of his own favorite expressions, a snake in the\nbreast—indeed, the wiliest of them. \nA more tractable and philosophically more interesting form of\nskepticism attributed to Bayle is Pyrrhonism. This interpretation has\nthe advantage of reconciling his denigration of reason and profession\nof faith: the one is a preparation for the other. The principal text\nfor Bayle’s Pyrrhonism is the Dictionnaire article on\nPyrrho, especially remarks B and C. There he argues that the same\nreasons that led the Cartesians to assert that sensory qualities such\nas colors, heat, cold and smells are not in the objects of the senses,\nbut instead are modifications of the mind, in fact show that all\nqualities have this status. In fact, says Bayle, even granting that\nGod is veridical, Descartes’s proof of the external world itself\nis flawed. For, as Malebranche argued, in no way can belief in that\nworld be based on the veracity of God, who in any case allows us to be\ndeceived about sensory qualities, and who might therefore allow us to\nbe deceived about all else in the world. \nIn this text Bayle also gives arguments that purport to show that\nreason itself is unreliable. Principles of reason that are as evident\nas could be are revealed as incompatible with what is known to be\ntrue. However, the examples that Bayle gives indicate the tenuousness\nof his Pyrrhonism. The principle that no human body can be in two\nplaces at once, or be interpenetrated by its own parts, is at odds\nwith the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the sacrament of\nthe Eucharist. Now, this is the Catholic conception of the Eucharist,\nwhich Bayle himself rejects. In fact, all of the arguments emerge from\na conversation that Bayle places between two Catholic priests, thus,\nfor whatever reason, distancing himself from them. It has recently\nbeen argued in fact, that the reason Bayle distances himself in this\nway is that he is offering a reductio ad absurdum of Catholic\nfideism based on philosophical skepticism. That is, Bayle rejects even\nthis ground-clearing role for skepticism as preparation for faith,\nsince it would be an instance of Pelagianism. \nGenerally, Bayle’s arguments concerning skepticism are highly\ncontextualized. He offers no in vacuo critique of pure\nreason. The arguments usually occur in the Dictionnaire,\nwhose entries offer some minimal constraint on what Bayle says, and\nthey usually occur in religious debate of some sort, where the role of\nfaith needs to be ascertained. Nor is there ever a wholesale rejection\nof reason, which would be paradoxical, given Bayle’s use of\nargument. In the ancient world, Sextus Empiricus thought of argument\nas like a purgative that once having done its work is itself flushed\naway. Although he employs his own version of the medical model (reason\nis like a corrosive that first cleans a wound but then eats through\nflesh and bone to the very marrow), Bayle seems to have a very\ndifferent view. Shifting analogies in response to the liberal\nProtestant Jacquelot, who had criticized his fideism as renouncing\nreason altogether, Bayle explained that individual defeats of reason\nentailed only a retreat to a more defensible position, something that\nhappens all the time in philosophy. His assessment of reason, even in\nhis most outré statements (reason is like a runner who\ndoes not know when the race is over, or like another Penelope undoing\nat night what was done during the day), is on a case-by-case basis,\nand whatever generalizations he offers are open to revision. \nBayle seems to espouse something of a holistic web of belief, of the\nQuine-Ullian sort, at least in the sense that cognitive antinomies are\nresolved by rejecting the principles causing them, beginning with\nthose farthest from the center. Bayle, however, includes religious\ntruths as at the very center, trumping all others. Another\ncomplication is that sometimes there seems no way to resolve the\nantinomies, as in the case of the divisibility of matter. The relevant\nmaxims of reason seem equally central, yet yield an exhaustive and\ninconsistent triad of views, none of which is true. Unlike the\nPyrrhonists, however, whose aim is to sustain antinomies, Bayle tries\nto resolve them. If there is the occasional standoff, Bayle’s\nattitude is one of regret and patience, for he is interested in\novercoming doubt, not generating it. The motivation he gave for the\nDictionnaire, after all, was the correction of errors,\nconfusion and doubt in previous such works. \nThe form of skepticism that seems best to capture this attitude is\nAcademic skepticism, which is in fact the position he explicitly\nespouses when accused of Pyrrhonism by Jurieu. This skepticism is not\nthe negative dogmatism, as defined by Sextus, that nothing can be\nknown. Rather, it is the methodological position expressed by\nCicero’s injunction always to preserve the integrity of\none’s power of judgment; that is, not to dissipate it in\naccepting as true what one does not perceive to be true. In this\nsense, the first of Descartes’s rules of method in the\nDiscourse is an Academic principle, perhaps the only one: to\navoid precipitateness and prejudice and to rely only on one’s\nown ability to discern the truth. Integrity is a matter of honestly\npreserving the wholeness of one’s own judgment. \nPart of this outlook would be the reportorial role that Bayle assumes,\nof giving unimpeded voice to all views, even those that compete with\nhis own. Only a lawyer would argue a single position to the exclusion\nof all others. Moreover, if this Academic skepticism were\nBayle’s outlook, he could not have espoused it as such, for to\ndo so would be still another form of dogmatism. Thus, instead of\ndefining, arguing and recommending Academic skepticism in any direct\nfashion, he would give instances if it, practice it himself and\ngenerally seek its promulgation through edification. This might be\nexactly what he does. \nIf Bayle doubts, he does so on a highly contingent and non-theoretical\nbasis. He is prepared to accept what he finds to be evident, but the\nfact of the matter is that he does not find it very often, at least\nnot in philosophy. In history, on the other hand, there is a kind of\ncertainty appropriate to the domain that is often enough to be found.\nThe Dictionnaire itself cannot be interpreted except as\nstupendous testimony to the ability of an individual to overcome\npassion and prejudice and arrive at historical truth—so much so\nthat Bayle’s historical method has been viewed by the literature\nas a form of Cartesianism, despite the Cartesians’ own dismissal\nof history. Only in one domain, however, is anything like strictly\nCartesian infallibility to be found, and that is morality. There, the\nindividual conscience is inviolate. Even if it errs with respect to\nthe objective moral character of an act, conscience, so long as it\nacts with integrity, cannot morally err and is to be respected. Such\nis the basis for Bayle’s view on toleration. \nNo philosophical topic occupied Bayle more than toleration. Many of\nthe articles of his Dictionnaire deal with it, and most of\nthe rest of his other works are directed either largely or entirely to\nthe topic, most notably, his Commentaire philosophique. It is\nan area in which he clearly had a profound impact on the\nEnlightenment. Locke also might have found in Bayle, if not a source\nfor his own views, then at least moral support for them, which he\nhimself might have provided for Bayle. In any case, their views are\nvery similar, even to the point of excluding Catholics from the\nprovisions of toleration (although their theories provide little on\nbehalf of this exclusion and much against it). \nThe toleration in question means religious toleration, although what\nis said about it can be extended to political and other forms of\ntoleration. The question is whether someone whose sincere belief is\nperceived to be in error should be forced to change it. Bayle’s\nview is that in this case of the erring conscience, as it was called,\nconstraint, even in the perceived interest of the errant individual,\nis never justified. The relevance of this issue in the context of\nHuguenot persecution is obvious. \nBayle’s direct arguments on behalf of toleration are not very\nconvincing, however, at least not when taken in isolation. Consider,\nfor example, his argument that if even the true church had the right\nto persecute the heretic, then every church would have that right,\nwith the result that a heretical church would be in a position to\npersecute the true church. Quite apart from whether this conclusion is\nso obviously false as to serve as the reductio as absurdum\nthat Bayle intends, his argument turns on an equivocation. A premise\nof the argument is that only if the true church believed that it was\nthe true church would it be in a position to persecute, otherwise it\nwould give up its position and join, or at least seek, what it would\ntake to be the true church. But if this belief justified the true\nchurch, then it would justify every church that had it. The\nequivocation concerns the sense in which the true church might base\nits right to persecute. Certainly, only if a church believed itself to\nbe the true church would it be in a position to exercise its putative\nright to persecute. But this is not to say that this belief by itself\njustifies the persecution. Such a view would beg the question against\nthose who, like Jurieu, think that only the objective fact, in this\ncase of actually being the true church, can ever justify. \nBayle is far more convincing when he generalizes from carefully\narticulated examples, the best of which is that of the wife of Martin\nGuerre. Bayle, whose native Le Carla was the next village over from\nthe site of the actual events, would have known about the case from\nthe local retelling of it, which has been continuous from the\nfifteenth century to the present. The short of the story is that\nMartin Guerre goes off to war, leaving behind his wife, child and\nproblematic existence, and is replaced eight years later by an\nimpostor who claims all his rights, including those of the marriage\nbed. According to Bayle, because she thinks the man is her husband,\nthe wife, in ceding him those rights, not only is inculpable of an act\nthat otherwise would be adulterous, but actually performs her duty. He\nconcludes, more generally, “the erroneous conscience procures\nfor error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience\nprocures for truth.” \nAn instructive curiosity is Bayle’s handling of this case from\nthe point of view of the impostor. Because the wife has an obligation\nto submit to him, the impostor has a right to treat her as his wife.\nBut it does not follow, according to Bayle, that the impostor would be\njustified in exercising that right. The sort of case that he has in\nmind is the magistrate, and likely the church. With respect to their\nbehavior there are two notions of right: immunity from punishment and\njustice. Whatever their pronouncements, they are to be obeyed; but\nthey might yet be culpable before God. This distinction does not\nelucidate the case of Martin’s Guerre’s impostor, who is\nan authority of neither church nor state. But it does emphasize\nBayle’s contention that if the heretic has the duty to act\naccording to conscience, then he has a right to do so; but if he has a\nright to do so, then everyone has a duty not to interfere. The\nindividual conscience is autonomous and ought to be tolerated. \nEven this position is less than straightforward, however, for it may\nhappen that the individual conscience calls for persecution. Bayle\nseems not to have fully considered this case, but his best answer\nwould seem to be that the conscientious persecutor should be\nrestrained, but in a way that least poses a direct threat of\ntemptation to conscience. That is, the conscience of even a persecutor\nmust be respected, such that although it is regarded as mistaken, the\nindividual should not be forced or even bribed to act against it.\nRational persuasion to the contrary would seem to be the sole remedy\nrecommendable by the alleged skeptic Bayle. What this case shows, in\naddition, is that while conscience is necessary for right action, it\nis not sufficient. It supplies a formal requirement, as it were, with\nthe content of the act being determined on other grounds. To be told\nto act according to conscience is in effect to be told to do what one\nthinks is right. But arriving at what one thinks is right is another\nmatter, involving reason, but also other factors such as grace or\neducation, which for Bayle are not much different from a matter of\nluck. \nIf a perfectly good and all-powerful God alone created everything in\nthe universe, then why do pain, moral wickedness, and so many\nvarieties of imperfection exist? Philosophers today refer to the\nfamily of issues raised by this question as “the problem of\nevil.” There is perhaps no thesis for which Bayle is more\nwell-known than the skeptical claim that there is no rational solution\nto the problem of evil. Such skepticism can already be found in\nBayle’s earliest work, the 1675–77 Philosophy Course, in\nwhich Bayle argues that no available account of God’s causal\nrelation to sin and suffering answers the problem. Bayle again attacks\ntheodicy (i.e. the attempt to answer the problem of evil), especially\nthe Cartesian strand, in his 1679 Objectiones to Pierre\nPoiret’s Cogitationes Rationales de Deo, Animo, et\nMalo. And both the 1682 Pensées diverses and\n1686–88 Commentaire philosophique, though they\nprimarily deal with superstition and toleration respectively, also\npositively engage God’s causal role in evil and demonstrate the\ninsoluble puzzles it raises. \nBut the centerpiece of any discussion of Bayle and the problem of evil\nmust be the Dictionnaire, particularly the articles\n“Manichéens” and “Pauliciens” of the\nfirst edition, and the “Eclaircissement sur les\nManichéens” of the second. It is in these texts that\nBayle attempts to refute every theodicy he had yet encountered,\nthereby demonstrating the incapacity of reason, especially within the\nconfines of Christian dogma, to explain the origin of evil in a way\nthat does not make God its sole author. The suggestion that reason\nleads us ineluctably to the conclusion that God is morally responsible\nfor all evil was found so scandalous that Bayle was forced to spend\nthe last decade of his life defending himself against charges of\natheism and even sedition on account of it. The Rationalist\ntheologians Jean Le Clerc and Isaac Jaquelot were Bayle’s\nprincipal adversaries, and their objections to Bayle, as well as their\nattempts at theodicy, prompted him to expand his skeptical reflections\non evil in subsequent books, including the Réponses aux\nquestions d’un provincial and the posthumous Entretiens\nde Maxime et de Thémiste. These final works were the\noccasional cause of Leibniz’s Theodicy, as well as the\ninspiration for (and source for many of the arguments of)\nVoltaire’s satirical novella, Candide, several chapters\nof Hume’s Dialogues concerning Natural Religion, and\npossibly Kant’s late essay, On the Miscarriage of All\nPhilosophical Trials in Theodicy. \nBayle’s controversial “doctrine” on the problem of\nevil that caused so much commotion was carefully summarized by Bayle\nhimself in three points: \nThe first principle was a common supposition in Bayle’s day, and\nso obviously caused no controversy. Nevertheless, Bayle argued on\nbehalf of the principle in “Manichéens,” remark D,\nin passages that render more precise the nature of Bayle’s\nskepticism about theodicy. Bayle imagines a monotheist philosopher,\nMelissus, arguing with a dualist philosopher, Zoroaster, over the\norigin of evil. The dispute begins with a contest over a\npriori arguments. In other words, the first question raised is\nwhether one principle of creation or two is most in accord with ideas\nof pure reason. Melissus wins this particular debate, in Bayle’s\nview, because it is more agreeable to a priori reason to\nsuppose that there is just one necessary and infinitely perfect being\nresponsible for the creation of the universe than to suppose that\nthere are two warring gods, one good and the other evil (which is the\nview of Bayle’s fictionalized Zoroaster). Melissus’\nmonotheism is, in short, simpler and more elegant than\nZoroaster’s dualism. \nThe contentious elements of Bayle’s doctrine begin to surface\nwhen the debate then turns to a posteriori reasons; that is,\nonce the question shifts away from the beauty of the theory to its\nability to account for the observable phenomena. In this debate\nMelissus fares worse than his interlocutor, since human reason finds\n“the manner in which evil was introduced under the empire of a\nsovereign being, infinitely good, infinitely holy, and infinitely\npowerful … not only inexplicable, but even incomprehensible;\nand everything that is opposed to the reasons why this being permitted\nevil is more agreeable to the natural light and to the ideas of order\nthan these reasons are” (Dictionnaire,\n“Pauliciens,” rem. E). Simplicity and elegance are now on\nthe side of Zoroaster (and the Manichean tradition that followed him,\nif Bayle’s history is correct), for whom all the good in the\nworld is traceable to a perfectly benevolent deity, while all the evil\nis the effect of his malevolent enemy. Therefore, whereas a\npriori reason and Christian Scripture point toward monotheism\n(Bayle’s first principle), a posteriori reason raises\nperpetual difficulties for this picture in light of the way the world\nactually is (Bayle’s second principle).  \nSome of the most notorious remarks in the Dictionnaire are\nthose in which Bayle details how a dualist could refute the\ntraditional Christian accounts of the origin of evil, most of which\nbegin from the story of the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of\nEden. Bayle begins his critique by asking how such a Fall was even\nmetaphysically possible. If Adam and Eve were created wholly good,\nthen they should not have had the capacity to sin, since such a\ncapacity is hardly a good quality. But supposing an answer to this\nworry could be given, Bayle moves on to demand why God would permit\nthe possibility of sin to reduce to an actual sin, considering the\nterrible consequences that befell humanity as a result of it. The most\ncommon response to this question was that God had given human beings\nfree will, the most generous divine gift of all, and the autonomy of\nwhich God willed to respect in order to make true worship and love of\nhim possible. Bayle’s response again focuses on the metaphysical\npossibility of the explanation: can a creature that derives all its\nbeing from God ever act in a manner that is truly free? Even supposing\nan account of freedom could be offered to answer this question, Bayle\nstill finds the free-will defence unsatisfying on account of\nGod’s alleged omniscience. Surely God foresaw the first sin of\nhumankind from all eternity, yet he created humans with freedom\nanyway. Is this not comparable, Bayle asks, to supplying a criminal\nwith a knife knowing full-well that he will commit murder with it? If\nso, the responsibility for the murder falls at least partially on the\nsupplier of the weapon. But perhaps God allowed humans to fall so that\nhe could send his Son to redeem them. To this last resort of the\nChristians-the felix culpa theodicy-Bayle observes that God\nin this case would resemble a father who allowed his son to break his\narm (though he could have prevented it) just so that he could display\nhis skill at cast-making to the neighbors. Or God would be like a king\nwho permitted a deadly uprising just so he could demonstrate his\nability to quell it. God would not appear infinitely perfect\non any of these hypotheses.  \nSuch reflections demonstrate the need for Bayle’s third\nprinciple (assuming that one is interested in upholding Christian\nmonotheism). The origin of evil, like the Trinity, is a mystery\nfraught with endless difficulties. On Bayle’s view of religious\nmysteries, which he lays out at the beginning of his\nEclaircissement sur les Manichéens, philosophical\nobjections to mysteries are nothing troubling, but merely serve to\nconfirm that God’s mind infinitely surpasses human minds. If\nthere were no insoluble philosophical objections to mysteries, then\nthere would be nothing mysterious about the doctrines in\nquestion-reason could answer every difficulty, and could claim\nequality with God’s own mind. For these reasons Bayle conflated\nthe traditional categories of “above reason” and\n“against reason,” claiming that mysteries were necessarily\nboth. Reason is consequently useless, even pernicious, as a basis for\nbelief in the mysteries, and so must be replaced by simple faith\n(Bayle’s third principle). \nBayle’s most able philosophical critic on these issues during\nhis lifetime was Jean Le Clerc, who argued that Bayle’s doctrine\non the problem of evil was intentionally subversive of religion. The\nbasis of Le Clerc’s accusation of atheism against Bayle was his\nclaim that it is not pyschologically possible to continue to believe\nsome doctrine after one has conceded that it is met with insoluble\ndifficulties. If this psychology of belief were true, then the second\nprinciple of Bayle’s doctrine would destroy belief in monotheism\nbecause, by supposition, it would be impossible to believe in the\nunity of God after acknowledging the irresistible force of the\nManicheans’ objections. In response to Le Clerc Bayle argued in\nhis posthumous Entretiens de Maxime et de Thémiste\nthat it is not only psychologically possible to believe in a\nproposition that has been defeated in argument, but also very common.\nBayle points to the debate over the continuum to illustrate his\nthesis. Those engaged in the debate over whether lines are infinitely\ndivisible or ultimately reducible to points of finite size recognize\nthat there are insoluble paradoxes opposed to each point of view. Yet\nthere are adherents of both views all the same, which demonstrates, by\nhistorical fact, that it is possible to believe in a proposition (e.g.\n“lines are infinitely divisible”) despite recognizing\nunanswerable difficulties (e.g. Zeno’s paradoxes). Far from a\nrecommendation of adopting irrational fideism in response to the\nproblem of evil, Bayle therefore believed he was urging the same\nrational retreat from certain debates that philosophers are commonly\nforced into when they argue about labyrinthine philosophical topics\nlike the continuum. \nBayle undeniably had an enormous influence given the wide readership\nof his work; but the precise nature of that influence, even in\nindividual cases, remains a desideratum of research. Bayle’s\nconnections with Locke, Leibniz, Kant and the Enlightenment have\nalready been at least suggested. Here the debt to him of Berkeley and\nHume will be looked at. \nThe literature regards Bayle, not only as an original source for the\nEnlightenment, but as a conduit of the views and arguments of his\nimmediate predecessors in the seventeenth century. A good example of\nwhere Bayle’s role has not been made precise is his discussion\nof the primary-secondary quality distinction. Bayle is supposed to\nhave conveyed Foucher’s arguments against the distinction to\nBerkeley and Hume. The contention is that just as Malebranche produced\narguments to show that secondary qualities exist only in the mind, so\nhis critic Foucher extended those same arguments to show that primary\nqualities also exist only in the mind. In fact, however, the arguments\nthat Foucher actually deployed were directed less against Malebranche,\nwhom he took simply to assume the distinction, than against Descartes\nand especially Rohault. His point was not to undo the distinction, but\nto show that however it was understood, it was incompatible with\nCartesian dualism. \nIt was Bayle himself in the famous note B of the Pyrrho article who\ntook Foucher to be extending Malebranche’s arguments: “if\nthe objects of our senses appear to us coloured, hot, cold, smelling,\ntho’ they are not so, why should they not appear extended and\nfigured, at rest, and in motion, though they had no such thing.”\nAlthough a parallel is established, the argument is obviously not very\nstrong. Now, the most notable mutatis mutandis argument employed by\nBerkeley against the distinction is based on the relativity of sense\nperception: the perception of both varies under varying conditions, so\nif the variation of secondary qualities is a reason to place them in\nthe mind, it is also a reason to place the primary in the mind. This\nargument is not to be found in Foucher or in this article, but it does\nappear in note G of the Zeno article, unconnected with Foucher:\n“the modern Philosophers, though they are no Sceptics,”\nhave made secondary qualities no more than perceptions in the mind;\n“why should we not say the same thing of extension?” Bayle\nagain deploys the weak parallel argument above, and then continues:\n“Observe also, that the same body appears to us little or great,\nround or square, according to the place from whence we view it: and\ncertainly, a body which seems to us very little, appears very great to\nfly.” A problem for this text as a source for Berkeley is that\nthis very argument is to be found better presented in Malebranche, who\nis cited here along with other moderns such as Lamy and Nicole, who\nare supposed to be undone by it. Given that Malebranche is cited by\nBerkeley more often by Berkeley’s notebooks than anyone but\nLocke, it would seem more likely that Berkeley went straight to\nMalebranche for his arguments on the primary-secondary\ndistinction. \nA stronger connection between Berkeley and Bayle would be the text\nitself, and especially note H, of the same Zeno article. By appeal to\ntheoretical parsimony, according to Bayle, “the Cartesians may\nmaintain that no such thing as matter exists; for whether it doth or\ndoth not exist, God could equally communicate to us all the thought we\nhave.” Such divine communication is, of course, precisely what\nBerkeley was to advocate. Moreover, Bayle in note G extends\nZeno’s argument against motion by denying that extension exists.\nHis argument is that extension cannot be composed of mathematical\npoints or of atoms, nor can it be infinitely divisible. It remains an\nopen question how this squares with Berkeley’s comment in his\nnotebooks, which he repeats there, that “Malebranche’s\n& Bayle’s arguments do not seem to prove against Space, but\nonely Bodies.” The only other time Bayle is mentioned in\nBerkeley’s entire work is in the Theory of Vision\nVindicated, where he is mentioned, with Hobbes, Spinoza and\nLeibniz, as an author whose popularity shows how atheistic principles\nhave taken root. \nThat Bayle exercised an enormous influence on Hume is beyond doubt.\nNot long before publishing his Treatise, Hume drew the\nattention of his friend Michael Ramsey to four texts that would\nfacilitate his reading of it. One of them was “the more\nmetaphysical Articles of Bailes [sic] Dictionary; such as those [on]\nZeno, & Spinoza.” Now, it is conceivable that Hume\nencountered these texts, and recognized their propaedeutic value, only\nafter completing his Treatise; but this bare possibility (the\nletter was written two years before its publication) is absolutely\nruled out in the case of Bayle, if not of the other texts Hume names,\nby Hume’s so-called early memoranda and especially by the use\n(unacknowledged, as was typical for the period) that he actually makes\nof Bayle’s work in the text itself. \nOf the philosophical entries in the early memoranda, about half deal\nwith Bayle. Even more important are the textual uses of Bayle. Kemp\nSmith long ago drew attention to five issues on which, in his view,\nBayle had an unquestionable influence on Hume. First, from the article\n“Zeno” Hume takes Bayle’s tripartite division of the\npossible ways that space and time might be constituted: from\nmathematical points, or from physical points, or as infinitely\ndivisible. But whereas Bayle argued in no uncertain terms that none of\nthese possibilities was rationally defensible, Hume in effect opts for\nphysical points with his conception of indivisible minima\nsensibilia (colored points, in the case of space). Although the\nresult is a non-standard account of geometry as an inexact science,\nHume thinks that he thereby preserves reason from otherwise\nirresolvable antinomies. \nSecond, Hume is supposed to have been influenced by Bayle’s\nhistorical account of the types of skepticism and his own use of\nskeptical argument in attacking orthodox positions. Bayle’s\nposition on skepticism has been discussed above. It may not be too\nmisleading to describe Hume’s resolution of skeptical\ndifficulties in terms of “taste and sentiment” as a\nnaturalistic version of Bayle’s supernaturalistic resolution in\nterms of grace that was described by the same phrase. \nA third connection concerns the metaphysics of substance, mode and\nidentity. Hume takes from the article “Spinoza” the\nobjections Bayle lodged against Spinoza’s “hideous\nhypothesis” that there is but a single substance which is God,\nand applies these objections to the view that humans possess a soul\nthat is a simple, indivisible and immaterial substance. The whole of\nHume’s argument in three stages and two rebuttals of a reply is\nlifted from Bayle. Both the unique substance and the substantial soul\nare supposed to be indivisible, yet are really identical to the\nextension that is their mode, hence are divisible; both have contrary\nproperties; etc. The upshot is that just as Spinoza’s hypothesis\nis “unintelligible,” so is the theologians’\nsupposition concerning the soul. \nFourth, Kemp Smith draws attention to the discussion of animal\nintelligence in the article “Rorarius.” In this instance,\nthe influence of Bayle is less clear. Presumably, he had in mind\nchapter nine of the Enquiry; but here one finds as the main\nexercise an application of the argument by analogy with an emphasis on\nthe importance of experience. There is, however, an ultimate appeal to\ninstinct to explain the cognitive behavior of both men and animals.\nAnd here Bayle might have played a role, alluded to immediately\nabove. \nFinally, Hume might have been influenced by Bayle’s treatment of\nreligious questions, especially the argument from design. This is an\nexceedingly vexed area because of the questionable orthodoxy of\nBayle’s views and the expression of them. Many of the same\nambiguities, of course, infect Hume’s views on these questions,\nalthough his heterodoxy seems far less debatable.","contact.mail":"michaelhickson@trentu.ca","contact.domain":"trentu.ca"}]
