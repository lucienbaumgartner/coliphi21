Davison","entry":"prophecy","body.text":"\n\n\nA prophet is a person who plays as special role mediating the\nrelationship between other people and the divine. People typically\nenvision prophecy in terms of God communicating through a prophet to\nothers some important information that could not have been known to\nthe prophet in any ordinary way. Prophecy is interesting from a\nphilosophical point of view for many reasons, including the fact that\nit raises compelling questions about divine knowledge and\ncommunication, human language, the nature of time, and human freedom.\nUnlike theologians or apologists, philosophers rarely argue about who\nhas actually prophesied what, or whether or not a given prophecy came\ntrue. Instead, they prefer to argue about ideal cases, where the\ntheoretical issues can be clearly identified. In this article, we will\nfollow their lead by sidestepping completely the question of whether\nor not any apparent prophecies have actually been fulfilled. We will\nalso avoid the question of the existence of God, which is addressed by\na number of other entries in this encyclopedia (see the entries listed\nin the Related Entries section below). \n\nIt is often assumed that the primary purpose of prophecy is to\nforetell the future, but this is not always the case. In the great\nmonotheistic religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam),\nfor instance, a prophet is taken to be a person who makes God’s will\nparticularly clear, whether or not this involves making predictions\nabout the future. As William Hasker says, in these traditions,\nprophets are usually involved in “witnessing to the people\nconcerning God’s purposes and requirements and seeking to recall them\nto obedience” (Hasker 1989, 194). There are fascinating debates\nin these religious traditions, especially in the medieval period,\ndebates that we will not discuss here (see Kreisel 2001, Shatz 1998,\nRahman 2011, and the entries in this encyclopedia concerning key\nhistorical figures discussed in those sources). Related questions\nabout how a human person might come to know God’s will through some\nkind of revelation are discussed elsewhere in this encyclopedia, for\nexample in the entries on\n the epistemology of religion\n and\n philosophy and Christian theology. \nBut when philosophers discuss prophecy, they are typically interested\nin prophecies concerning the contingent future, so that will be the\nfocus in the remainder of this article. What special philosophical\nissues are raised by this kind of prophecy? \nLet’s say that a future event is contingent if and only if it is both\nnot determined that it will happen and also not determined that it\nwill not happen.  (For more on the notion of determinism, see the\nentry on\n causal determinism.)\n Now imagine that based upon the revelation of an infallible God, a\nperson prophecies that some future contingent event will occur. Since\nGod cannot be wrong, does it follow that the future contingent event\nmust occur? And if it must occur, how can it be a contingent\nevent? \nAn especially vivid example of this kind of situation comes from the\nChristian tradition. Jesus reportedly prophesied that his disciple\nPeter would deny him three times before the cock crowed (see Matthew\n26:34). Typically, we would think of Peter’s denial as a free act, and\nhence as contingent. (For more on this connection, see the entries on\n compatibilism,\n free will, and\n causal determinism.)\n But since Jesus cannot be mistaken (according to Christian theology),\nhow are Peter’s later denials free? Once Jesus’ words become part of\nthe unalterable past, don’t they guarantee a particular future,\nwhether or not Peter is willing to cooperate? \nThis problem is an especially interesting instance of the more general\nproblem of the compatibility of God’s complete foreknowledge with the\nexistence of future contingent events (for more on this general\nproblem, see the entry on\n divine foreknowledge and human freedom).\n Whereas the more general question about God’s foreknowledge typically\ninvolves just God’s knowledge and the future contingent event, the\nproblem of prophecy involves a third element, namely, the prophecy\nitself, which becomes a part of the past history of the world as soon\nas it is made. This additional element adds an interesting twist to\nthe general problem, making it more difficult to solve. \nPhilosophers have responded to this problem in several different ways.\nOne obvious way to respond is simply to claim that there are no future\ncontingent events. Different people have taken this approach for\ndifferent reasons. Some are attracted to the idea that every event has\na prior sufficient cause (see the entry on\n causal determinism).\n Others believe that the idea of free choice does not require anything\nlike real contingency or the possibility of doing or intending\notherwise (see the entries on\n compatibilism\n and\n free will).\n Still others believe that God’s providential control over the world\nis so thorough and detailed that nothing is left to chance, not even\nthe apparently free choices of human beings (see the views defended in\nCalvin 1536, Carson 1981, and Feinberg 1986, for instance, and the\nentry on\n divine providence).\n So one possible response to the difficulty here is to give up one\nhalf of the problem by denying that there are any future contingent\nevents. To return to our example from the Christian tradition, when\nJesus truly prophecies that Peter will deny him three times before the\ncock crows, there is no philosophical puzzle as long as we do not\nclaim that Peter’s denials are contingent events. \nMany philosophers and theologians do not find this approach very\npromising, though, because they believe strongly in future contingent\nevents, especially human free choices. How else might one respond to\nthe problem posed by prophecies concerning future contingent\nevents? \nAnother way of trying to solve the puzzle is to deny that God has any\nknowledge of the contingent future. According to this approach, often\ncalled “open theism”, there may be future contingent\nevents, but God does not know about them. God does not know about them\neither because (1) there are no true propositions now that report what\nfuture contingent events will occur, or because (2) it is impossible\nfor anyone, including God, to know such true propositions, or because\n(3) God chooses not to know them in order to preserve our freedom\n(see, e.g., Swinburne 1986, chapter 10). Open theists also typically\nargue that foreknowledge alone would be providentially useless to God\n(see Hasker 1989, for instance; for more on open theism, see Hasker\n1989 and 2004, Basinger and Basinger 1986, Basinger 1994, Pinnock\n1986, Pinnock et al 1994, Rice 1985, and Davison 1991 and 2003). How\ncan open theism explain prophecies that appear to make reference to\nfuture contingent events? \nWilliam Hasker, perhaps the most prominent advocate of open theism,\naddresses this problem explicitly, and suggests a three-fold response.\nFirst, he points out that the main function of prophecy is not to\nforetell the future, but to reveal God’s will (Hasker 1989, 194). Many\nprophecies, in fact, have a conditional character, such as “If a\nnation does not do such and such, then it will be destroyed”\n(see Jeremiah 18:7–10, for example). Second, many prophetic\npredictions are based upon existing trends and tendencies, which\nprovide God with enough evidence to foresee the future (Hasker 1989,\n195). (Hasker places Jesus’ prediction about Peter in this category,\nby the way.) Finally, some prophecies simply reveal what God has\nalready decided to bring about in the future (Hasker 1989, 195). Since\nGod’s own actions in the future are up to God, it is possible for God\nto know about them even though they are contingent, so it is possible\nfor prophecies to reveal them. \nThomas P. Flint argues that Hasker’s attempt to solve the problem of\nprophecy from within the constraints imposed by open theism is\ninadequate. Flint argues that if people are truly free in a sense that\nimplies future contingency, then not even God could know very much\nabout the future based upon present trends and tendencies alone. This\nis because the probability of any particular future contingent event\nis very low, so that God would not have much justification for\nbelieving that any particular future contingent event would occur (see\nFlint 1998, 102–5). As an example, Flint points to John 6:64,\nwhich seems to imply that Jesus knew that Judas would betray him. How\ncould this be, Flint wonders, when the probability that Judas would\nbetray Jesus was so low?  He also points out that Hasker faces a\ndilemma here that other open theists share, namely, that if they\ninsist that the probabilities of future contingent events are high\nenough to justify God in making predictions about the future, then God\nactually doesn’t take much of a risk in creating the world. This is\nproblematic for some open theists, who claim that their view has the\nvirtue that God takes certain risks in creating the world; see Flint\n1998, 104–6.) \nWe will not try to adjudicate the dispute between Flint and Hasker\nhere, since that would take us beyond the scope of this article.\nInstead, let’s consider other possible solutions to the problem of\nprophecy. In order to classify them, it will be helpful to describe\nbriefly the different ways that philosophers and theologians have\ntried to explain God’s knowledge of the contingent future. \n\n William Ockham\n (c.1285–1347), a highly influential Christian philosopher and\ntheologian from the medieval period, suggested an interesting way of\naccounting for God’s knowledge of the contingent future and resolving\nthe problem of prophecy. (For more detailed presentations of Ockham’s\nviews, see the introduction to Ockham 1983 by Adams and the\nintroduction to Molina 1988 by Freddoso.) Ockham claims that what a\nprophet has truly revealed about the contingent future “could\nhave been and can be false” (Ockham Predestination,\n44), even though the existence of the prophecy in the past is\n“ever afterwards necessary” (Ockham\nPredestination, 44). As Calvin Normore puts it, “After\nGod has revealed a future contingency it is necessary that the\nphysical or mental things he used to reveal it have existed, but what\nis revealed is not necessary” (Normore 1982, 373). In terms of\nour example involving Jesus’ prophecy concerning Peter’s denial,\nOckham’s idea is that were Peter to choose freely not to deny Jesus\ninstead, then Jesus would never have prophesied that Peter would deny\nhim. (Some philosophers like to call this kind of proposition a\n“back-tracking counterfactual”, because it is a\nsubjunctive conditional statement whose consequent refers to an\nearlier time than its antecedent.) In other words, if a person were\nabout to choose freely to do something, then God would have known\nabout it from eternity, and hence would have acted accordingly.  \nIf this is right, then Ockham’s idea seems to imply that we have the\nability to do something now such that if we were to do it, then the\npast would have been different (because God would known what we would\ndo differently and hence would have acted differently in the past).\nSome philosophers refer to this kind of ability as\n“counterfactual power over the past.” Alvin Plantinga has\nthis idea in mind in his defense of Ockham’s account of God’s\nforeknowledge of the contingent future when he says that “it is\npossible that there is an action such that it is within your power to\nperform it and such that if you were to perform it, then God would not\nhave created Abraham” (Plantinga 1986, 257). Along the same\nlines, Edward Wierenga suggests that according to Ockham, Peter has\nthe power to do something such that if he were to do it, then Jesus\nwould not have intended what he said about Peter’s future\ndenials as a prophecy (Wierenga 1991, 440). In other words, Jesus\nuttered words that actually did constitute a prophecy, but those same\nwords would not have been a prophecy had Peter chosen otherwise\n(Wierenga 1991, 440).  \nMore recently, Trenton Merricks (2009) has defended the idea that\nGod’s past beliefs depend upon our future free choices (although he\ndistinguishes his proposal from Ockham’s: see Fischer and Todd 2011\nand the reply in Merricks 2011a). \nBut doesn’t this attribute to Peter a rather odd power over the past?\nOnce Jesus says certain words with a certain intention, is it coherent\nto say that Peter still has a choice about whether or not to betray\nJesus? Some philosophers have expressed doubts along these lines about\nwhether or not Ockham’s approach is ultimately successful. Alfred J.\nFreddoso, for instance, claims that “Ockhamism commits one to\nhaving to choose between the Scylla of claiming that God can undo the\ncausal history of the world and the Charybdis of claiming that divine\nprophecies might be deceptive or mistaken” (Freddoso 1988, 61;\nsee also Warfield 2009). Finch and Rea (2008) have also argued that a\ncommitment to Ockham’s solution is incompatible with a belief in\npresentism, the view that only the present moment is real. Whether or\nnot these things are so, one might wonder about the prospects for\nanother solution.  \nA very different approach to explaining God’s knowledge of the\ncontingent future involves suggesting that God exists outside of time\naltogether. This would mean that God does not foreknow the future,\nstrictly speaking, since foreknowledge is knowledge of an event that\nis possessed at a moment in time that occurs earlier than the moment\nin time at which the foreknown event occurs. Instead, the idea is that\nGod knows all events from the perspective of timeless eternity. (For\nfurther elaboration and defense of this view, see Stump and Kretzmann\n1987, Helm 1988, and Leftow 1991.) Many theists have adopted this view\nthroughout the centuries, including the highly influential medieval\ntheologian\n St. Thomas Aquinas\n (1225–1274). One of the earliest Christian theologians to\ndefend this approach to answering the Knowledge Question was Boethius\n(480–524 C.E.), who wrote in The Consolation of\nPhilosophy that “[Since] God has a condition of\never-present eternity, His knowledge, which passes over every change\nof time, embracing infinite lengths of past and future, views in its\nown direct comprehension everything as though it were taking place in\nthe present” (Boethius Consolation, 117). \nSome philosophers have objected to this way of explaining God’s\nknowledge because they think that it represents an unbiblical picture\nof God derived largely from Greek philosophical influences (see\nWolterstorff 1982, for example). But it does suggest an interesting\napproach to the problem of prophecy. In terms of our example, the\ndefender of God’s atemporal eternity would say that God knows from the\nperspective of eternity that Peter will deny Jesus at a certain time,\nand on this basis, Jesus prophecies in time that the event in question\nwill occur.  \nOne worry about this approach is that once Jesus prophecies at a\nparticular time that Peter will deny him, God’s atemporally eternal\nknowledge seems to be “introduced” into the past (as David\nWiderker says in Widerker 1991), and the advantages of the atemporal\neternity view seem to disappear. For we are still left with trying to\nexplain how Peter’s denial could be contingent, given that the\nprophecy has already occurred. It seems that either Peter’s denial is\nnot free or the past can be changed somehow.  \nEleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann, probably the most prominent\nadvocates of the atemporal eternity view, have defended the atemporal\neternity approach to prophecy against Widerker’s objection (see Stump\nand Kretzmann 1991). They point out that most prophecies are\nconditional or vague, so that they leave “room” for\ndifferent ways in which they might be fulfilled (400–401). If a\nprophecy were to be very specific, then it might actually render the\naction in question inevitable, they admit, but they also insist that\nrendering an action inevitable is not the same as making it unfree.\nThis is because they distinguish freedom of action from freedom of\nwill, and argue that “it is possible for an action to be\ninevitable and yet a free action” (403), as (for instance) when\n“the agent himself has a powerful desire to do the action, his\nwill is not causally determined by anything external to him or by\npathological factors within him, and the inaccessible alternatives to\nhis inevitable action are alternatives the agent has no desire to do\nor even some desire not to do” (403). Trying to resolve the\ndispute between Widerker and Stump and Kretzmann would go beyond the\nscope of this article, though, so instead we will turn to the final\nalternative solution to the problem of prophecy.  \nThis last approach to explaining how God knows the contingent future\nstarts with an observation concerning foreknowledge and providence\nthat advocates of open theism have made very clearly and forcefully.\nWhy would knowledge of the future be useful to God? Well, presumably\nknowledge of the future enables God to make decisions about how to\nexercise divine power in order to accomplish the purposes behind\ncreation. But there is a problem here: knowledge of the future is just\nknowledge of what will happen (since the future is by definition\nwhatever will happen), and once God knows that something definitely\nwill happen, then it’s too late to do anything about it. (This may\nsound like a limit on God’s power, but probably it is not: not even\nGod can make something false while that same thing is known to be\ntrue.) As William Hasker says, “In the logical order of\ndependence of events, one might say, by the ‘time’ God\nknows something will happen, it is ‘too late’ either to\nbring about its happening or to prevent it from happening”\n(Hasker 1989, 58). So what God needs, for the purposes of providence,\nis not just knowledge about what will happen, but also knowledge about\nwhat could happen and what would happen in certain circumstances.  \nLuis de Molina, an influential Spanish Jesuit theologian\n(1535–1600 C.E.), thought that this was a serious problem. In\norder to develop a view that would explain the relationships between\nall of these things, he drew a distinction between three kinds of\nknowledge in God, a distinction that suggests another response to the\nproblem of prophecy. (For more complete and detailed presentations of\nthis view, see Freddoso’s introduction to Molina 1988, Craig 1987,\nFlint 1988 and Flint 1998.) \nAccording to Molina, the first kind of knowledge that God possesses is\ncalled natural knowledge. A true proposition is part of God’s natural\nknowledge if and only if it is a necessary truth (a truth which could\nnot be false under any circumstances whatever) which is beyond God’s\ncontrol (nobody, including God, could make them false). Examples of\nsuch true propositions would include “Two plus two equals\nfour”, “Nothing is both red all over and green all over at\nonce”, and “Every triangle has three sides.” \nThe second kind of knowledge that God possesses is called free\nknowledge because it is subject to God’s free decision. According to\nMolina, a true proposition is part of God’s free knowledge if and only\nif it is a contingent truth (an actual truth which could have been\nfalse under different circumstances) that is within God’s control.\nExamples of such true propositions would include “The same side\nof the moon always faces the Earth”, “Human beings\nexist” and “There are iguanas in South America”,\nsince God could have brought it about that these true propositions\nwere false instead. \nThe third kind of knowledge that God possesses, according to Molina,\nis called middle knowledge (because it is “in between”\nGod’s natural knowledge and free knowledge). A true proposition is\npart of God’s middle knowledge if and only if it is a contingent truth\n(like items of God’s free knowledge) but beyond God’s control (like\nitems of God’s natural knowledge). The most frequently discussed items\nof middle knowledge are often called “subjunctive conditionals\nof freedom” by philosophers, since they describe what people\nwould freely do if placed in various possible situations. \nMolina claims that God’s providential control over the world involves\nmiddle knowledge in a crucial way. Very briefly, here is how it is\nsupposed to work: through natural knowledge, God knows what is\nnecessary and what is possible. Through middle knowledge, God knows\nwhat every possible person would do freely in every possible\nsituation. So God decides which kind of world to create, including\nthose situations in which free human persons should be placed, knowing\nhow they would respond, and this results in God’s free knowledge\n(contingent truths which are up to God), including foreknowledge of\nthe actual future. \nIn the case of Jesus’ prophecy that Peter would deny him, Molinists\nwould say that God knew (through middle knowledge) that if Peter were\nplaced in certain circumstances, then he would deny Jesus. And for\nreasons not known to us, God decided to create those circumstances,\nplace Peter in them, and prophecy through Jesus what Peter was going\nto do. (For a much more detailed explanation, see Flint 1998, chapter\n9.) Molina’s theory of middle knowledge generates a theory of\nprovidence designed to combine a strong notion of God’s control with a\nrobust account of the contingency involved in human freedom. (It also\nappears to have some biblical support, because there are verses which\nseem to attribute middle knowledge to God, although this is disputed:\nsee I Samuel 23:6–13 and Matthew 11:20–24.)  \nHowever, philosophers have expressed several doubts about whether or\nnot it is possible for God to possess middle knowledge, doubts that\nparallel those expressed above in connection with the possibility of\nGod’s foreknowledge of the contingent future. For one thing, they\nwonder about counterfactuals of freedom: can we really assume that\nthese are either true or false? How can they be true if (for example)\nthe person in question is never in the situation and never actually\nmakes a choice? What “grounds” them or makes them true? A\nsecond worry about Molina’s picture has to do with the nature of\nknowledge. Even if a given counterfactual of freedom is true, knowing\na proposition requires that a person be able to distinguish what is\ntrue from what is false. The worry here is that perhaps not even God\ncould distinguish true counterfactuals of freedom from false ones. For\nmore detailed discussions of these objections, see Adams 1977,\nFreddoso’s introduction to Molina 1988, Craig 1987, Flint 1988, Flint\n1998, Hasker 1989, Davison 1991, and Perszyk 2011. (For a clever\nattempt to explain prophecy without middle knowledge, see Pruss 2007\nand the response from Corabi and Germino 2013.)  \nThere are several ways to try to resolve the problem of prophecy,\nwhich arises in cases where a future contingent event is predicted.\nThe approaches discussed here have various strengths and weaknesses.\nThe question of prophecy has been receiving increased attention as the\ndebate over the extent of God’s knowledge has become more widely\ndiscussed in recent work in the philosophy of religion. As a result,\none could reasonably predict that philosophical arguments concerning\nthese matters will continue indefinitely into the future.
