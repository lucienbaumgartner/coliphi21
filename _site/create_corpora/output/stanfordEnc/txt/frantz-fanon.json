In his lifetime, he published two key\noriginal works: Black Skin, White Masks (Peau noire,\nmasques blancs) in 1952 and The Wretched of the Earth\n(Les damnés de la terre) in 1961. Collections of essays,\nA Dying Colonialism (L’an V de la révolution\nAlgérienne 1959) and Toward the African\nRevolution (Pour la revolution Africaine), posthumously\npublished in 1964, round out a portrait of a radical thinker in\nmotion, moving from the Caribbean to Europe to North Africa to\nsub-Saharan Africa and transforming his thinking at each stop. The\n2015 collection of his unpublished writings, Écrits sur\nl’aliénation et la liberté, will surely\nexpand our understanding of the origins and intellectual context of\nFanon’s thinking.\n\n\nFanon engaged the fundamental issues of his day: language, affect,\nsexuality, gender, race and racism, religion, social formation, time,\nand many others. His impact was immediate upon arrival in Algeria,\nwhere in 1953 he was appointed to a position in psychiatry at\nBilda-Joinville Hospital. His participation in the Algerian\nrevolutionary struggle shifted his thinking from theorizations of\nblackness to a wider, more ambitious theory of colonialism,\nanti-colonial struggle, and visions for a postcolonial culture and\nsociety. Fanon published in academic journals and revolutionary\nnewspapers, translating his radical vision of anti-colonial struggle\nand decolonization for a variety of audiences and geographies, whether\nas a young academic in Paris, a member of the Algeria National\nLiberation Front (FLN), Ambassador to Ghana for the Algerian\nprovisional government, or revolutionary participant at conferences\nacross Africa. Following a diagnosis and short battle with leukemia,\nFanon was transported to Bethesda, Maryland (arranged by the U.S.\nCentral Intelligence Agency) for treatment and died at the National\nInstitute for Health facility on December 6, 1961.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1952, Fanon published his first major work Black Skin, White\nMasks. Though just 27 at the time of its publication, the work\ndisplays incredible literacy in major intellectual trends of the time:\npsychoanalysis, existentialism, phenomenology, and dialectics, as well\nas, most prominently, the early Négritude movement and U.S.\nbased critical race work in figures like Richard Wright. Modest in\nlength, the book is notable for its enormous ambition, seeking to\nunderstand the foundations of anti-Black racism in the deepest\nrecesses of consciousness and the social world. The book is\nFanon’s major work on blackness. In fact, his focus shifts in\nthe years following the publication of Black Skin, White\nMasks, moving away from blackness as a problem—perhaps\nthe problem—of the modern world and toward a wider\ntheory of the oppressed, colonialism, and revolutionary resistance to\nthe reach of coloniality as a system. But that shift is unthinkable\nwithout Fanon’s early meditations on anti-Black racism.\nFanon’s reflections on anti-Black racism and how it forms, then\ndeforms, the subjectivity of white and Black people both, is crucial\nfor understanding the multiple levels of colonial subjugation and the\nterms of its overcoming. There is something about anti-blackness as\ntreated in Black Skin, White Masks that is a concrete,\nuncomplicated distillation of coloniality as such. Fanon’s first\nbook, then, can be said to set out the basic structure of his anti-\nand de-colonial work, initially and emphatically in the terms of\ndescribing the effects and affects of anti-black racism. \nFanon’s method in Black Skin, White Masks is a\ncomplicated question and one of the more interesting bits of scholarly\ndiscussion. The primary approach in the text is\nexistential-phenomenological, something borne out in the rich,\ntextured personal narratives that seize upon the essential structures\nof the narrativized event of anti-blackness, and also indicated in the\ntitle of the fifth chapter—L’experience\nvécu (experience vécu translates the key\nphenomenological notion of Erlebnis, properly rendered in the\nRichard Philcox translation as “lived-experience”). Lewis\nGordon’s work on Fanon has argued for the centrality of\nexistentialism and existential framing of key questions across his\noeuvre, especially in Gordon’s early work Fanon and the\nCrisis of European Humanity (1995) and recently in What Fanon\nSaid (2015). The influence of Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice\nMerleau-Ponty also lends credence to the phenomenological\ncharacterization, but Fanon’s sustained engagement with the\nNégritude movement, psychoanalysis, Hegelian thought, and\nMarxism (something evidenced most clearly in later works and\ndocumented in Reiland Rabaka’s multi-volume interpretation of\nFanon, Négritude, and revolutionary Africana theory) opens up\nthe question of methodology to any number of interpretations and\nremains one of the more engaging areas of Fanon-interpretation. Homi\nBhabha’s innovation as a reader of Fanon has been to draw out\nthe post-structuralist dimensions of his thought, thereby weaving\nFanonian themes into contemporary postcolonial theorizations of\nhybridity, language, subjectivity, and time. We see much the same in\nAnthony Alessandrini’s provocative book on Fanon and cultural\nstudies, Fanon and the Future of Cultural Politics (2014),\nwhich puts Fanonian thinking in dialogue with Michel Foucault, Edward\nSaid, Jamaica Kincaid, and Paul Gilroy, among others. In the end,\nFanon is a unique thinker who blends personal narrative and\npolitical strategizing with heady social theory and numerous\nphilosophical twists and turns. \nThe introduction to Black Skin, White Masks contains key\nconclusions and foundational pieces of analysis summed up\nFanon’s simple declaration: that Black people are locked in\nblackness and white people are locked in whiteness. As well, Fanon\noffers a sketch of the relationship between ontology and sociological\nstructures, asserting that the latter generate the former, which, in\nturn, lock subjectivities into their racial categories. The chapters\nthat follow are in many ways a long, sustained argument for these\nassertions, venturing into questions of language, sexuality,\nembodiment, and dialectics. Perhaps most importantly, Fanon’s\nopening gambit introduces the central concept of the zone of\nnon-being. The zone of non-being is the “hell”, as Fanon\nputs it, of blackness honestly confronted with its condition in an\nanti-Black world. The anti-Black world, the only world we know, hides\nthis non-being to the extent that it ascribes a place and role to\nabject blackness. But the truth is the zone of non-being. In an\ninteresting and crucial twist, Fanon, in the Introduction, does not\ndescribe descent into this zone as nihilism or despair. Rather, he\ncounters with a vision of subjectivity as “a yes that\nvibrates to cosmic harmonies” (1952 [2008: 2]). Descent into the\nzone of non-being produces this yes and its revolutionary\npower, revolutionary precisely because the anti-Black world cannot\ncontain or sustain the affirmation of Black life as life, as being, as\nhaving a claim on the world. This claim and this yes is the\npositivity of what becomes political violence in Fanon’s later\nwork. \nAcross the core chapters of Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon\ndraws together the existential experience of racialized subjectivity\nand the calculative logic of colonial rule. For Fanon, and this is\ncritically important, colonialism is a total project. It is a\nproject that does not leave any part of the human person and its\nreality untouched. This is no more evident than in the opening chapter\nto Black Skin, White Masks on language. Fanon’s\nreflections on language, racism, and colonialism begin with a wide\nclaim: to speak a language is to participate in a world, to adopt a\ncivilization. The claim reflects in many ways the philosophical milieu\nof mid-century French and German philosophy, which in phenomenology,\nexistentialism, and hermeneutics explore the very same\nclaim—that language, subjectivity, and reality are entangled as\na matter of essence, not confusion or indistinction. But the colonial\nsituation makes this all the more complicated. If speaking a language\nmeans participating in a world and adopting a civilization, then the\nlanguage of the colonized, a language imposed by centuries of colonial\ndomination and dedicated to the elimination or abjection of other\nexpressive forms, speaks the world of the colonizer. To speak as the\ncolonized is therefore to participate in one’s own oppression\nand to reflect the very structures of your alienation in everything\nfrom vocabulary to syntax to intonation. It is true that many\nAfro-Caribbeans speak pidgin and creole as part of everyday life. But\nFanon, in a claim that does not age well in Caribbean theory, measures\npidgin and creole expression against French, arguing that\nAfro-Caribbean speaking, in those registers, is a fallen, impoverished\nversion of the metropolitan language and thus participates in\ninferiority. In this way, vernacular speech speaks the\ncolonizer’s world into existence in naming the colonized as\nderivative, less than, and fundamentally abject. Caribbean theory from\nthe 1970s to the present has largely been dedicated to defending the\nlegitimacy of creolized language and cultural forms, against Fanon and\nagainst colonial languages as the measure of being and knowing. \nBut there is no alternative for Fanon. In one of the most important\nmoments of the book, Fanon discusses the problem of diction and racial\nembodiment. The black person can perfect speech, learn to speak\nperfect French and sound like a sophisticated Parisian. That\nmight promise a certain kind of liberation from the\nalienation in and through mastery of proper French. That is, if the\nblack colonial learns to speak as well as the white Parisian, then\nperhaps there can be equal participation in language and its world.\nYet, this is impossible because of what Fanon terms the\nepidermal character of race. To be black and speak with\nperfect diction is still to be black, and therefore marked as special,\nunique, and surprising. Fanon’s anecdotes in the opening chapter\ndescribe this as the surprise of white French people at the\narticulateness of a black French speaker. Surprise is a reminder of\ninferiority, not in the content of one’s presence, but rather on\nthe bearing black skin has on the white mask of perfect diction. There\nis no escape from the epidermal skin. Embodiment frames linguistic\nperformance and limits its significance. Fanon also remarks on how\nthis fated-to-failure emphasis on diction in turn alienates the black\nperson from his or her fellow black people—the desire to be\nwhite, Fanon’s characterization of the drive to perfect diction,\nmeans alienation from blackness and this lands the black subject,\nagain, in the zone of non-being. \nThe second and third chapters of Black Skin, White Masks\ntheorize interracial sexuality, sexual desire, and the effects on\nracial identity. Fanon’s theorizations return to one and the\nsame theme: interracial desire as a form of self-destruction in the\ndesire to be white or to elevate one’s social, political, and\ncultural status in proximity to whiteness. In that sense, all\ndepictions of interracial sexuality (exclusively heterosexual) are for\nFanon fundamentally pathological. The black woman who desires a white\nman suffers under the delusion that his body is a bridge to wealth and\naccess. Mayotte Capécia’s novel I Am a Martinican\nWoman (1948) guides Fanon’s analysis and he takes her book\nto be exemplary of the black woman’s psyche and of the limits of\ninterracial desire. The black man who desires a white woman suffers\nunder the delusions of what her body offers: innocence and purity.\nFanon draws this from Germaine Guex’s book La Névrose\nd’abandon (1950) and expresses it directly when writing, in\nthe voice of Guex’s Black man, “When my restless hands\ncaress those white breasts, they grasp white civilization and dignity\nand make them mine” (1952 [2008: 45]). The white body and Black\ndesire for that body function much as language does in the opening\nchapter to Black Skin, White Masks: the passage to standing\nin the world, made impossible by the epidermal racial scheme, and\ntherefore fated to alienation at every turn. Fanon’s analyses\nare provocative, associative, and infused with the language of\npsychoanalysis and existential-phenomenology. And, thus, in each turn\nof the story, interracial desire is pathological, not because of the\ncontent of the characters and their desire, but because anti-Black\ncolonialism is a total project that has infiltrated, modified, and\ncalcified all aspects of the lifeworld. \nThe incredibly important fifth chapter to Black Skin, White\nMasks, titled “The Lived-Experience of the Black Man”\n(“L’expérience vécue du noir”), is\nbookended by two chapters examining psychological accounts of the\ncolonized. In the fourth chapter, Fanon undertakes a systematic\ncritique of Octave Mannoni’s psychoanalytic account of colonial\noppression and in the sixth chapter he works through a psychoanalytic\naccount of racialized libidinal economy. Both chapters are crucial for\nunderstanding the role of psychoanalysis in Fanon’s thought, as\nwell as an opportunity to see his creativity as a reader who\nrepurposes colonial or colonial-tinged methods and analyses for the\nsake of clarification of the effects of anti-Black racism under\ncolonial domination. Fanon’s conclusions are not surprising, of\ncourse. Psychoanalysis, like his original readings of interracial\nrelationships, provides Fanon a language for describing all the\neffects and affects on desire under anti-Black racism, and how\ngendered notions of power, embodiment, and selfhood are structured\nfrom the inside by the colonial practice of racism. What he\nuncovers in his critique and repurposing of psychoanalysis are new\nlayers of pathology on the part of the colonizer, of course, but also\nof the colonized who cannot function as intact psyches. As well, Fanon\nargues in some detail against the capacity of European psychoanalysis\nto understand the colonial situation. Blackness requires modifications\nin method, especially if that method is to open space for resistance,\nrebellion, and liberation. \nBut “The Lived-Experience of the Black Man” is really the\nkey chapter in the book. In that chapter, Fanon deploys the conceptual\ntools developed in previous chapters in order to debunk the remaining\nlegacies of racial essentialism. A good bit of this was undertaken in\nthe first chapter, where Fanon critically reads Aimé\nCésaire and his articulation of Négritude around the\nquestion of language. The existential-phenomenological character of\nthe fifth chapter, however, adds real depth and texture to\nFanon’s position. It begins and returns repeatedly to an\nanecdote in which a white child points to Fanon and declares\n“Look, a Negro!” Fanon explores how this phrase is akin to\na racial slur, how racism is integral to the declaration itself rather\nthan being an addition to it: to say “Negro” is to say an\nanti-Black slur. In developing this account, Fanon revisits Jean-Paul\nSartre’s account of the gaze and how it fixes the identity of\nthe other, here infusing that account with a rich treatment of the\nstructures of an anti-Black racist lifeworld. The white gaze fixes\nblackness, making it with a slur and epidermal character, thus sealing\nblackness into itself. As well, Fanon discusses Sartre’s account\nof anti-Semitism in Anti-Semite and Jew: An Exploration of the\nEtiology of Racism (1948), noting how it is inadequate to the\nphenomenon of anti-Blackness as a form of racism. Whereas the\nanti-Semite fears the Jew because of his alleged power and\nsuper-capacity, the anti-Black racist detests the Black person because\nof his alleged weakness and incapacity. That is, anti-Semitism\nreflects a panic about Jewish superiority, anti-Black racism reflects\ncontempt for Black inferiority. With this complex in place, Fanon\nreturns with some important sympathy to Césaire’s version\nof Négritude, exploring the limits and possibilities of poetry\nfor an alternative vision of Black life. Négritude may be\nnaïve and fundamentally wrong at the level of ontology, but it\ndoes alter the affective relation of Black people to themselves. That\nis no small accomplishment. Across these discussions, Fanon develops\nhis notion of the inferiority complex, which is his subtle and\nimportant account of how anti-Black racism is internalized by Black\npeople and how that internalization adds complexity to the pathologies\nof living under colonial rule. Négritude, whatever its limits,\nis an antidote and Fanon’s appreciation for it is one of the\nmore compelling parts of the chapter. \nThe seventh and final full chapter offers a critical reading of\ndialectics, filtered through both Alfred Adler’s psychology and\nG.W.F. Hegel’s philosophy. At stake in the chapter is\nrecognition—recognition of blackness, of subjectivity, and\ntherefore of humanity. This is one of the most enigmatic ideas in\nBlack Skin, White Masks. Fanon is deeply critical of\ndialectical thinking, while at the same time drawing deep, important\nlessons from it. In particular, Fanon is concerned with how a\ndialectics of recognition might simply mean elevation of the\nBlack person to a sense of humanity created by and modeled on white\npeople. The entirety of the text, of course, has been dedicated to\ndisputing that move and offering alternative ways of thinking about\nthe future. So Fanon rejects the nascent, or sometimes explicit,\nconception of recognition that appeals to a pre-constructed idea of\nthe human—suspicious, rightly, that such an idea is always\nracialized. And so too he is suspicious of any dialectical method that\nleaves a sense of measure intact—namely, a dialectical method\nthat proceeds from a logic of recognition. Fanon resists at every turn\nthe desire for recognition if that recognition proceeds from an\ninevitably colonial sense of standard or measure. Rather, in terms of\nHegelian methodology, Fanon is interested in the risk of life at the\ncenter of Hegel’s dialectic, and how that dialectic both exposes\nthe conceptual dependency of the colonizer on the colonized\nand how confrontation, the work of negation in dialectical\nthinking and struggle, aims to destroy pre-existing forms of relation.\nIf those pre-existing forms of relation are destroyed, then a certain\nkind of revolution is possible, one in which the humanity of the\ncolonized black person might emerge, on its own terms, for the first\ntime. Fanon’s imagination turns to the future as unprecedented.\nWhat could blackness be after colonialism? \nThe conclusion to Black Skin, White Masks follows through on\nthis notion of futurity and a dialectics dedicated to the destruction\nof pre-existing forms of relation. Fanon’s conclusion is written\nin very short paragraphs or provocative, declarative sentences. Across\nthe final pages, Fanon outlines a theory of history and memory that\nunderpins his vision of Black liberation, including most prominently\nthe notion that we are not bound to history, we are not slaves to the\npast, and therefore any kind of future is possible. Fanon rejects the\nidea of reparations, for example, precisely because that idea would\nlink Black people to the past in a crucial way and make that link\ninextricable from imagining justice. In place of the past, Fanon\nappeals to the openness and undetermined character of the future. What\ndoes Fanon want for black people? In perhaps the most famous line of\nthe book, Fanon concludes with the plea: “Ô mon corps,\nfais de moi toujours un homme qui interroge!” (“O my body,\nalways make me a man who questions!”) (1952 [2008:\n206]). Subjectivity in the interrogative is therefore Fanon’s\nsolution to the problem of racial entrapment, the opening motif of how\nwhite people are trapped in whiteness, black people trapped in\nblackness. The man who questions has broken out of that trap. \nThe effusive optimism and hope of the Conclusion aside, Black\nSkin, White Masks is an essentially pessimistic book. That is,\nthe book describes a psychological, linguistic, ontological, and\nlibidinal landscape that is structured through and through by\nanti-Black racism. No desire or mode of being is left untouched.\nFanon’s evocation of a total break with the past in the\nConclusion confirms this pessimism and shows that his sense of\nliberation is tied to an apocalyptic revolutionary\npraxis—something we see developed over the following decade. \nIn the immediate half-decade that follows the publication of Black\nSkin, White Masks, Fanon revisits key claims about anti-blackness\nand the possibilities of Black life that enrich, deepen, and widen his\nformulations in 1952. One of the questions that arises quite naturally\nfrom Black Skin, White Masks is how well, if at all, the\nconcept of blackness developed therein travels across the Caribbean to\nthe United States, or from the Caribbean to Africa. Fanon does not\nspend much time discussing the United States; while some of his\nunpublished work, recently collected in the volume Écrits\nsur l’aliénation et la liberté, shows a keen\ninterest in the work of Richard Wright, and the early rustlings of the\nearly civil rights movement (along with Wright) are mentioned in\nBlack Skin, Whites Masks, Fanon’s move to refine and\nnuance his account of blackness turns to Africa. In the 1955 essay\n“West Indians and Africans” (“Antillais et Africains”),\nFanon renews his critique of the Négritude movement and its\nnostalgic orientation toward the continent. In a provocative\nassociation, Fanon concludes the essay by linking “the great\nwhite error” of colonialism with his characterization of\nNégritude thinking as “living in the great black\nmirage”. (1964 [1994: 27]) Alongside that criticism of\nNégritude, Fanon blends personal history, reportage, and a bit\nof existential-historical sensibility in discussing the\ndifferences between Afro-Caribbeans (West Indians) and black\nAfricans. Fanon’s occasion is the Second World War and the\nexperience of West Indian and black African soldiers fighting side by\nside, which allowed intimate exchange about racial identity. These\nexchanges, on Fanon’s account, return again and again to the\nnotion that West Indians are not Black enough, perhaps not Black at\nall, which he implies adds to the psychological and moral appeal of\nNégritude. A key lesson to draw from this essay, especially in\nlight of the work that follows it, is that Fanon’s skepticism\nabout blackness as an identity—inextricably bound to\nanti-blackness—moves him further and further away from concerns\nabout the Black experience. This move is deeply connected to his time\nin Algeria, as we see below.  As well, Fanon’s well-known essay from 1956 “Racism\nand Culture” (“Racisme et culture”) re-engages the question of\nblackness and argues for a deep, abiding connection between\nanti-blackness and cultural formation more broadly. The essay,\ndelivered at one of the most important gatherings in the history of\nblack Atlantic thought, the 1956 Congress of Negro Writers and\nArtists, de-links racism from the psyche and the interpersonal,\nlodging racism instead inside the very workings of\nculture. Fanon’s contribution to the 1956 Congress broke from\nthe emphasis on Négritude and Négritude thinking at that\nmeeting, and his reflections are noteworthy for that reason alone.\nAgainst the emphasis on racial quasi-essentialism, “Racism and\nCulture” examines how anti-Black racism is part of the structure\nand function of culture, rather than identifying blackness as an\ninherent site of resistance. Fanon writes that racism  \nis never a super-added element discovered by chance in the course of\nthe investigation of the cultural data of a group. The social\nconstellation, the cultural whole, is deeply modified by the existence\nof racism. (1964 [1994: 36])  \nThis move positions Fanon against Négritude in familiar and new\nways. It is familiar in that he rejects racialized thinking as central\nto Black liberation struggle, entwining race and culture at their\ncore; nothing from a racist culture can inform liberatory racial\nthinking precisely because the existence of racism “deeply\nmodifies” what appears in culture as race. Fanon\nunderscores this when he deems blues, an African-American vernacular\nart form, a “slave lament” that is “offered up for\nthe admiration of the oppressors” (1964 [1994: 37]). It is in\nsome ways new, insofar as he gathers together the multi-faceted\nanalysis and pessimism of Black Skin, White Masks and\ndistills it all into a vision of race and culture. And like the\nconclusion to Black Skin, White Masks, and indeed most of his\nwork, the vision is essentially apocalyptic. “The end of race\nprejudice”, Fanon writes, “begins with a sudden\nincomprehension” (1964 [1994: 44]). Which is to say, for Fanon\nthe de-linking of racism and culture only comes at the moment that\nculture itself, as we have known it, becomes incomprehensible and we\nbegin the work of assembling new cultural forms. This insight is fully\ndeveloped five years later in the central chapters of The Wretched\nof the Earth. \nFanon’s move to Algeria in 1953 marks an important turning point\nin his thought. He continues to write on anti-blackness in select\nessays and occasions, but Fanon’s shift is deep and meaningful.\nWhereas Black Skin, White Masks was concerned exclusively\nwith the structure of an anti-black world and how that world bears on\nthe body and psyche of the colonized, Fanon’s time in Algeria\nand later travels to sub-Saharan Africa broaden his analysis. Instead\nof a question of blackness, colonialism becomes for Fanon a larger,\nmore general question of the oppressed in the global south. The\nWretched of the Earth is the boldest and most important\nexpression of this shift, but the time he spends analyzing Algeria on\nits own terms reveals Fanon’s increasing sensitivity to\ndifference inside the colonial experience. Also, many of his\nmost important writings in this period were published in French\nlanguage newspapers across the continent of Africa, in particular the\nAlgerian National Liberation Front (FLN) newspaper El\nMoudjahid (for which he served on the editorial board), which\nhosts some of his most interesting reflections. This shift in his\nthinking, as well as some of the later points of emphasis and\ntheoretical transitions, bolster Ato Sekyi-Otu’s argument in\nFanon’s Dialectic of Experience (1997) that\nFanon’s work ought to be read as a series of political\nexperiences or stages in and at the basis of an unfolding of a long,\ncomplex system of thought.  Three essays are of particular significance in this period:\n“Algeria’s European Minority” (“La minorité\neuropéenne d’Algérie”), “Algeria\nUnveiled” (“L’algérie se dévoile”), and\n“The Algerian Family” (“La famille\nalgérienne”). \nFanon’s reflections in “Algeria’s European\nMinority” offer an important and insightful example of applying\nthe anti-colonial dimensions of Black Skin, White Masks. The\nkey anti-colonial insight in that text was how measure—the\nimperial function of whiteness in the Black psyche—structures\nthe world. Liberation, in Black Skin, White Masks, looks a\nlot like displacing measure in the name of the questioning subject.\nMeasure, here, means simply the ideal or standard according to which\n“the human” is evaluated. Fanon’s argument in\nBlack Skin, White Masks is that “the human”, an\nidea that comes from the European tradition, is a fundamentally racial\nidea deployed as a tool of alienation for the colonized. Liberation\nfrom measure means displacing the racialized idea of the human and\ninitiating a movement toward, then into, a new humanism. When\nthis notion travels to Algeria in “Algeria’s European\nMinority”, a critical essay addressing the possibility of\nrevolutionary Europeans in North Africa, we see how it also applies to\nthe white minority under colonialism. The revolution in Algeria is a\nmoment of decision for all Algerians, and pointedly so in the case of\nthe European minority who had lived there for generations and at an\nelevated social and political status. The default mode, of course,\nwould be to associate the European minority with the colonizing power:\nFrance. But Fanon argues that this is not necessarily the case and\nthat, in fact, revolutionary solidarity across racial-national lines\nis possible, even necessary (and, through examples in the text,\nactually practiced). Algeria, then, is revealed to be as much an\nideological category for identification with as it is a national,\nreligious, or racial category. The Wretched of the Earth will\nexplore these possibilities even further as a blueprint for the\ncolonized global South. But Fanon is particularly meticulous in\n“Algeria’s European Minority”, examining in detail\nhow each twist and turn of the psyche reflects possibilities and\nlimits, and in that meticulousness shows the enduring insight from the\nopening of Black Skin, White Masks – namely, that white\npeople are locked into whiteness, Black people into blackness.\n“Algeria’s European Minority” unpacks the process by\nwhich white people can unlock themselves in or be unlocked by\nanti-colonial struggle and revolutionary action. In that sense, the\ntext is an important study of how what comes to be called “race\ntraitor” politics can and should work in a revolutionary\ncontext. \nIn “Algeria Unveiled”, Fanon explores the relationship\nbetween Islam, tradition, colonial rule, and revolutionary\nconsciousness. The veil puzzles Fanon and challenges his deepest\npolitical commitment: postcoloniality means an embrace of the\nnew. Revolution is absolute and radical, marking a break with the\npast rather than a return to a different version of the past. The\nfuture is the future, and so full of the unprecedented. What does that\nmean for traditions that have been suppressed by colonial rule, for\nexample the veil in Islamic cultural practice? In his work on\nblackness, Fanon was quite clear that a return to African\ncivilization—the imperative of the Négritude\nmovement—represents a mirage and only doubles the loss of the\npast by losing black people in an illusion. But that is not the case\nwith his treatment of Islamic traditions in Algeria and other parts of\nthe Maghreb. The suppression of those traditions, on Fanon’s\naccount, marginalize or push tradition into secret—or, perhaps,\nkeep the tradition in the open, but always as backward, abject, and\ncontrary to modernity. This means tradition is still alive, not a\nmirage, and as alive also valued deeply by communities resisting\ncolonial rule. Such traditions can be instrumentalized for the sake of\nrevolutionary action, only to be evaluated after colonialism\nfor their suitability in a postcolonial nation and culture. The same\nlogic is elaborated in “The Algerian Family”, where Fanon\nexplores the traditional structure of families in Algeria, in\nparticular how those families set gender identity, power, marriage,\nand reproduction in fixed roles. Revolutionary families, he argues,\nidentify these fixed roles and break with them while also\nmaintaining a conviction that their practices are Algerian—that\nis, Algerian in the new sense. \nThese reflections on racial-national identification, religion, gender,\nand family all return to the same basic argument: revolution is about\nthe new. But that does not mean merely rejecting the past and\nsuspending all tradition. Rather, it means, for Fanon, identifying\nsites for transformation inside tradition, with emphasis on those\nsites which offer revolutionary or tactical possibilities. These\nessays and the many shorter companion pieces from the time show Fanon\npuzzling over his dual commitments—to a revolution that is\nalways for the future and to “the people” who are often\ndeeply committed to traditions. Thinking through that crossing of\ncommitments is the task of any revolutionary thought and Fanon’s\ncareful thinking is exemplary. \nIn terms of volume, Fanon’s turn to Africa in the years\nfollowing the publication of Black Skin, White Mask is\noverwhelmingly occupied with North Africa, and Algeria in particular.\nHowever, he also gives some key attention to sub-Saharan Africa or\nwhat he called “black Africa” in key essays, editorials,\nand letters collected in Toward the African Revolution. \nThough there is some variety in terms of content and particular\nthematic sites, Fanon’s relationship to sub-Saharan Africa is\nfairly consistent. The Algerian experience and ideology that emerged\nfrom it structures Fanon’s take on anti-colonial struggle in the\nregion, but he does not return to questions of anti-Black racism.\nAlgeria is for Fanon the exemplar of revolutionary struggle. So, when\ntalking about black Africa, Fanon will urge forgoing deep connections\nto or retrievals of pre-colonial Africa—something that reflects\nhis early critiques of Négritude, for sure, but are in these\nlater essays really plainly political and strategic. Africa is,\nideologically, a unity for Fanon, and that unity is regularly\narticulated in terms of shared colonial struggle. Thus, the divisions\nbetween North and sub-Saharan Africa are erased in a shift of\nperspective; memories and grievances that might flow from legacies of\nthe Arab slave trade are part of the disposable past. What matters is\nthe shared condition in the present, and therefore to the future of\nunified anti-colonial struggle. In “Unity and Effective\nSolidarity are the Conditions for African Liberation”\n(“Unité et solidarité effective sont les\nconditions de la libération africaine”) (1960), Fanon is\nplain in writing that “inter-African solidarity must be a\nsolidarity of fact, a solidarity of action, a solidarity concrete in\nmen, in equipment, in money” (1964 [1994: 173]). All of these\nsolidarities reflect an anti-essentialist approach to revolutionary\nstruggle, which is consonant with Fanon’s work from the\nbeginning. Also of note is how Fanon, in this context, asserts the\nnecessity of the neutrality of anti-colonial struggle in Africa with\nregard to Cold War alliances. The history of post-independence Africa,\nwhich was the site of so many proxy wars and destabilization efforts\nfrom both sides of the Cold War, bears out Fanon’s observation\nand assertion.  Fanon also pauses to pay special attention to Patrice Lumumba who\nin 1961, when “Lumumba’s Death: Could We Do\nOtherwise” (“La mort de Lumumba: pouvions-nous faire\nautrement?”)  was written, was known as a promising and important\nrevolutionary leader. Lumumba immediately after became emblematic of\nboth the revolutionary promise and seemingly inevitable neo-colonial\nfate of independent black Africa. This short essay is full of\ninteresting observations, most of which revolve around the failure in\nCongo to unify around an anti-colonial ideology. The lack of this\nideology, he notes, is what made Congo susceptible to Belgian and\nother European/American meddling, which then made Lumumba a natural\ntarget.  Lumumba’s bold identification with anti-colonialism\nenacted what Fanon most wanted: neutrality in the Cold War, singular\nfocus on the nation and the continent against colonialism in all\nforms.  Lumumba’s death leads to the greatest threat to\ngenuinely independent, anti-colonial Africa: national infighting\ninstead of continental solidarity and the return of intra-national\nethnic conflict that destabilizes what is most in need of\nstabilization. \nIn the end, it remains unclear how well Fanon understood the diversity\nof sub-Saharan Africa and its difference from North Africa, where he\nspent most of his time on the continent and to which his reflections\nare largely dedicated. The occasional pieces leading up to The\nWretched of the Earth raise interesting questions and show how\nFanon was dedicated to building lines of solidarity and shared\nstruggle. African unity was paramount in Fanon’s work on the\ncontinent, and he boldly extends the Algerian experience to the\ncentral and southern regions of Africa. At the same time, and this\nbecomes particularly clear when he reflects on black Africa’s\nmemory of the slave trade, Fanon in The Wretched of the Earth\ncalls for a suppression of memory and historical difference in the\nname of broader solidarity among the continent’s oppressed\npeoples. This has the strength of forging a vision of a future\nde-linked from the past—a project consistent with the\nrevolutionary conclusion to Black Skin, White Masks—and\nyet seems largely unaware of or unconcerned with the consequences of\nforgetting the historical experiences of large swaths of sub-Saharan\nAfrica. As well, the difference between settler colonies and those\nadministered from a distance fades a bit when Fanon travels his\nreflections to black Africa, a difference that has received a more\nnuanced treatment in postcolonial theory since Fanon. \nThat said, work by Nigel Gibson in Fanonian Practices in South\nAfrica (2011) and Achille Mbembe in Critique of Black\nReason (2013 [2017]) and Politiques de\nl’inimitié (2016), as well as essays by thinkers\nsuch as Mabogo Percy More, Richard Pithouse, and others, have placed\nFanon in critical dialogue with sub-Saharan African political\nrealities and emerging theoretical movements. This is some of the most\nexciting contemporary work in Fanon studies and indicates the rich,\nprovocative resources in his work for the twenty-first century. \nWithout question, the 1961 publication of The Wretched of the\nEarth (Les damnés de la terre) changed\nFanon’s global profile as a thinker of anti-colonial struggle,\nrevolutionary action, and post-colonial statecraft and\nimagination. \nIn many ways, Wretched is a fulfillment of the short,\nsuggestive promissory notes on anti-colonial struggle found in the\nmany essays, editorials, and letters written in the time following\nBlack Skin, White Masks. Those occasional writings and major\nessays shift focus away from anti-Blackness as a core theme and toward\na broader sense of the effects of colonialism on the psyche, cultural\nformation, and political organization. That shift in focus allows\nFanon to think more broadly about the meaning and purpose of\nrevolutionary struggle. \nThe opening chapter to Wretched is surely the most famous, in\npart because of the sheer power and provocation of its reflections, in\npart because it is the focus of Jean-Paul Sartre’s well-known\nForeword. Fanon’s concern with violence is critical for\nunderstanding the trajectory of Wretched, which ambitiously\nmoves from political agitation to cultural formation to postcolonial\nstatecraft to global philosophical re-orientation. It all begins with\nviolence. \nViolence is important for Fanon as a precondition to liberation,\nsomething George Ciccariello-Maher in Decolonizing Dialectics\n(2017) links to a broader concern in Fanon with decolonizing\nmethodology and revolutionary praxis. Violence as precondition\noperates in two directions: internal to the colony among the\ncolonizers and external in the formative conflict between the\ncolonized and the colonizer. Internal to the colony, Fanon breaks the\ncolonized into three groups. First, there is the worker whose\nrelationship to both the colonized and colonizer is organized around\nits capacity to work. This is a complicated relationship, one\nthat is both a relation of dependency (material needs are supplied by\nthe colonial system) and naturally revolutionary (exploited, yet also\nthat upon which the colonizer depends). Second, there is the\ncolonized intellectual, a compromised figure who plays a\ncrucial role across the body of Wretched, whether in relation\nto cultural renewal or to political resistance. The colonized\nintellectual mediates the relation of the colonized for the colonizer,\ntranslating the terms of colonial life into the language, concepts,\nand thinkable politics of the colonial power. There is\npotential in the colonized intellectual, insofar as it is a\nfigure whose epistemological roots cross with the life of the\ncolonized masses, but any potential is compromised, if not outright\nobliterated by the role the intellectual plays: to aid and abet the\ncolonizer. Third, there is the lumpen proletariat, a term\nborrowed from Karl Marx’s analysis of the dialectic’s\nremainder and translated into the conditions of colonialism. The\ncolonial lumpen are disposable populations that provide nothing to the\ncolonial system (displaced people, slum dwellers, subsistence\nfarmers), and therefore, from the outside, remain the greatest threat\nto the system. In a certain sense, this is a formalization of\nFanon’s earlier reflections on the role of the fellah\nin colonial Algeria—the group lying outside the system of urban\ncolonial and anti-colonial struggle, a figure of purity and pure\nrevolutionary power. \nViolence emerges as a critical concept in this moment. Part of the\ncolonizer’s fantasy of power and control lies in a perception of\nweakness, of inferiority, that is inherent in the colonized. The\ncolonized are weak and therefore, in some fundamental sense, deserve\ntheir abject condition. This is consistent with Fanon’s\nreflection on the inferiority complex in Black Skin, White\nMasks, but writ large and as a characteristic of a population and\npeople. If the inferiority of the colonized is an assumption\nand psychological reality of colonial life, then\nrevolutionary violence cannot but be a shock to the entire system. The\ncolonizer is shocked into awareness of the humanity of the\ncolonized in the moment in which they are willing to risk their lives\nfor another future. The colonized are shocked into awareness of their\nown potential and, in that potential, find themselves capable for\nforming a wide cultural, social, and political identity. Identity\nformation is critical in Fanon’s analysis; colonialism is a\ntotal project, so the colonized find themselves adrift in abjection.\nBut violence changes all of that. Violence is simultaneously a saying\nof no to colonialism and a saying of yes to the\npossibilities of post-colonial life. The system cannot survive this\nshock. And so it means everything to the three classes of colonized\nlife. The workers see the system on which they are dependent begin to\ncollapse. Exploitation becomes a site of resistance, rather than\nsomething to be endured for the sake of material needs. The colonized\nintellectual is exposed as counter-revolutionary and a key element in\nthe oppressive system. And the lumpen find an identity for the first\ntime, moving from disposable excess to anti-colonialism’s most\npotent revolutionary force. \nViolence is therefore tasked with the greatest of pair of intertwined\ntasks: elimination of the colonial system at the level of imagination\n(how colonizer-colonized relations are naturalized as superiority and\ninferiority) and of material reality (exploitative relations of\nsubordination and extraction), as well as formation of cultural,\nsocial, and political identities. The first chapter of\nWretched outlines and amplifies this enormous potential of\nrevolutionary, anti-colonial violence, and the chapters that follow\nelaborate the complexities of post-colonial formations of culture and\npolitics. \nThe next three chapters explore in great detail how revolutionary\nviolence is related to collective identity formation (Chapter Two),\nconsciousness of national identity (Chapter Three), and perhaps most\nimportantly the formation of national culture (Chapter Four). What we\nsee across these chapters is how potent and fecund Fanon’s\nconception of violence is, as well as how his various meditations on\nrevolution and identity in the essays between his first and his last\nbook pay real conceptual and strategic dividends. Conceptually, Fanon\ndraws the sharpest contrast between what he calls the colonized\nintellectual and the revolutionary masses. The colonized intellectual\nis exactly what the terms suggests: a go-between who translates the\ncolonized for the colonizer, in the colonizer’s language and for\nthe political, social, and cultural purposes of the colonizer. The\nmasses do not drive the colonized intellectual’s reflections,\nbut rather the colonial vision of the world structures everything.\nContrasted to that are the revolutionary masses who make a\nnew political, social, and cultural order through\nrevolutionary struggle itself. In this characterization, Fanon eschews\nvanguardism and all the sorts of elite revolutionary structures that\nfollow from it. Rather, for Fanon, struggle itself generates\npolitical, social, and cultural identities and concepts; there is no\nprefiguring this element of a postcolonial world. Revolution makes\neverything revolutionary, and the postcolonial state cannot be thought\nwithout it. And so Fanon’s elaboration of this movement also\ncriticizes atavistic notions of postcolonial state- and culture-craft,\nrejecting nostalgic turns to a precolonial African society as a vision\nfor post-revolutionary society. \nIf the colonized intellectual and the precolonial forms of life are\nnot just insufficient for, but actually damaging to, postcolonial\nworld-making, then the future is a break with the past. Grievances\ncomposed of memories of historical violence (e.g., the Arab slave\ntrade in black Africa) or ethno-religious and other cultural disputes\ngive way to revolutionary action that dispenses with, rather than\ndraws on, memory. The break with the past, at the level of\norganization and intellectual formation, is made through revolutionary\nviolence. So too is the future. There is no pre-existing national\nconsciousness or national culture, no genius or visionary who\nconceives it ahead of time, which means that revolutionary violence\nmust be purposeful, intentional, and oriented toward world-making. In\nthis way, Fanon’s work on violence is never nihilistic or\nrandom. Strategically, this means everything because conceptions of\npolitics, culture, and the postcolonial social order hinge on the\nproper sense of violence. \nThe Wretched of the Earth concludes with one of Fanon’s\nmost provocative and exciting pieces, evoking in much the same way as\nthe conclusion to Black Skin, White Masks the possibility of\na new future. In 1961, the future is for Fanon the question of the\nfate of humanism, a motif he shares with, most notably,\nCésaire’s 1955 text Discourse on Colonialism.\nWhat is humanism, Fanon asks, if it is held up to the measure of the\nworld? That is, what does humanism look like if disentangled from the\nEuropean concept, which is riddled with histories of violence and\nsubjugation, and instead reflects or is infused with the liberation\nstruggles of the global South? In terms of conceiving the\npost-colonial nation, Fanon returns to one of his earliest motifs:\nmeasure. Post-colonial nations, created through anti-colonial\nviolence, cannot be duplications or imitations of European states. In\npart, this is a resolutely anti-colonial ideological position: make\nfor yourself, do not make for the colonizer. But it is also, if not\nlargely, based in a critique of Europe that understands Europe to be\nin crisis itself, to be dependent upon (at every level) structures of\nexploitation and extraction. Europe is a “spirit built on\nstrange foundations” and characterized by “stasis”.\n(1961 [2005: 237]) Post-colonial states need different foundations,\nand so must work with new concepts and new imaginations of\ncollectivity. Central to this are conceptions and imaginations of the\nhuman itself. “[W]e must make a new start”, Fanon writes,\n“develop a new way of thinking, and endeavor to create a new\nman”. (1961 [2005: 239]) Fanon does not give this “new\nman” content. The new man belongs to the future. The new man is\nto come. \nFanon’s training in psychiatry is a central part of his work,\nfrom the methodological approaches to and characterizations of the\ndynamics of anti-Black racism in Black Skin, White Masks\nthrough the attention to postcolonial anxieties of cultural formation\nand statecraft in The Wretched of the Earth. \nBut apart from method alone, Fanon’s published and unpublished\nworks offer case studies of victims of colonialism, studies which\nemphasize the lived pathologies of everyday life under colonial rule.\nMany of these are in the unpublished writings collected in\nÉcrits sur l’aliénation et la\nliberté, but a key series of case studies are included in\nThe Wretched of the Earth. These studies are generally\nunder-thematized by Fanon scholars and postcolonial theory scholars\nmore widely, though a few recent publications indicate a renewed\ninterest in how concrete psychiatric work might function as part of\nthe postcolonial theory archive and in Fanon’s larger project.\nThe collaborative study by Nigel Gibson and Roberto Beneduce\nFrantz Fanon: Psychiatry and Politics (2017) goes a long way\ntoward closing this gap in the literature, examining in detail both\nthe history and theoretical work underlying Fanon’s psychiatric\nwritings and case studies. As well, David Marriott’s Whither\nFanon (2018) embeds the psychiatric writings and therapeutic\npractice inside Fanon’s work on anti-blackness and postcolonial\npolitics. \nFanon’s original studies consider a range of disorders resulting\nfrom colonial violence. Some are mental disorders, by which Fanon\nmeans a generalized sense of anxiety caused by colonial domination and\nacted out in discrete parts of the personality. Others bear the\ndisorder on the body and disfigure the person from the inside out or\ncreate sexual disorders connected to colonial degradations around\nfemininity and masculinity. As well, Fanon includes a short piece at\nthe end of The Wretched of the Earth on the medicalization of\ncriminality in Algeria, with particular interest in how those\ndisorders might be repurposed for the sake of revolutionary struggle.\nThe studies are very detailed and narrativized, which opens up a new\ndimension of Fanon as critical observer. The studies also draw out the\ntension between psychiatric treatment and political ideology,\nsomething Fanon would argue is not overlaid on the situation by the\ntherapist, but instead discovered, in therapy, to have been installed\nby the colonial order. The influence of this aspect of Fanon’s\nwork can be seen in the Black Panther Party’s work in the United\nStates on prisoner reintegration and public health initiatives, all of\nwhich were seen as blending care for the oppressed with harnessing\nrevolutionary potential. \nWe could say that, in many ways, Fanon’s legacy and influence\noutsizes his modest output as a writer. Fanon wrote for about a\ndecade, which, in any comparison with other major thinkers, is almost\nno time at all. The pages produced, as well, are modest. Black\nSkin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth are\nsubstantial books composed of original chapters and analysis, but the\nother two works A Dying Colonialism (1959) and Toward the\nAfrican Revolution (posthumously published in 1964) are comprised\nof short essays, preliminary analyses, and occasional pieces. While\nthose shorter, preliminary, and occasional works are fascinating and\nimportant, they are a portrait of a thinker in motion, a thinker whose\ncommitment to diverse and unfolding revolutionary\nsites required both quick takes and patient contemplation. Fanon moved\nvery quickly through the Algerian struggle and did not hesitate to be\ndeclarative, and his work on black Africa is very much the same,\nalbeit without the same concrete engagement and intellectual\nbackground. Yet, Fanon is also patient and reflective, something we\nsee in the psychiatric studies that simultaneously underpin his\nbroader analyses and suggest other productive avenues for thought. \nIn other words, looking back six-plus decades later, we can see\nFanon’s oeuvre as composed of profound, enduring insights and a\nbody of un- and under-developed work. This mixed legacy in the written\nwork has not limited Fanon’s enormous influence. He was, in his\ntime and certainly in the decades following his death, a hero to and\nintellectual inspiration for anti-colonial and anti-racist struggle,\ninforming the work of thinkers from all over the global South. Latin\nAmerican militants drew on Fanon’s insights, as did so many on\nthe continent of Africa and across South Asia. His impact on cultural\nstudies is also sizable. Fanonian concepts inform countless\ndiscussions of race, nation, migration, language, representation,\nvisuality, and so on. This is largely due to Fanon’s unique\nability to engage across theoretical approaches and, in those\napproaches, infuse analysis with rich phenomenological descriptions of\nthe body and psyche under colonial domination. Reiland Rabaka’s\nForms of Fanonism (2011) is especially interesting here for\nits careful work to reinscribe these kinds of analysis into the Black\nradical tradition more broadly. \nThe recent publication and translation into English of Fanon’s\nunpublished works, which range from letters to a draft of a play, will\nsurely open up new dimensions of commentary. One of the signature\nfeatures of Fanon-commentary is the creativity of the interlocutors\nwho, if not doing lineage of influence textual study, have worked to\ninterpret and extend Fanon’s ideas. Indeed, this is one of the\nmore interesting features of Fanon scholarship, something Henry Louis\nGates, Jr. famously described as Fanon’s function as a sort of\nRorschach test—we see more in Fanon than is in the text. This is\nthe fecundity of Fanon’s thinking, really. Books like Glen\nCoulthard’s Red Skin, White Masks (2014) and Hamid\nDabashi’s Brown Skin, White Masks (2011) rewrite\nFanon’s first work with an eye toward the similar-yet-different\nforms of colonial experience in indigenous North America (Coulthard)\nand the Middle East (Dabashi). Other writers such as Homi Bhabha,\nNigel Gibson, Lewis Gordon, Richard Pithouse, and others have extended\nFanonian categories and concepts to treat the experience of exile,\nmigration, diaspora, African-American and Caribbean experiences,\ncontemporary post-Apartheid South African struggles for justice, and\nso on. This kind of work underscores the fecundity of Fanon’s\nideas, their elasticity and capacity for extending across historically\nand culturally diverse geographies. Such elasticity and capacity\nlargely derives from Fanon’s attention to the colonized as a\nlumpen and revolutionary force, something to which he gives great\ndescriptive and existential depth, rather than merely making an\nabstract ideological centerpiece. This attentiveness to the presence\nof deep resistance amongst the masses, even in the midst of profound\nand powerful forms of colonial oppression, is one of Fanon’s\ngreatest contributions to revolutionary theorizing of the black\nAtlantic, global south, and racially marginalized populations. It is\nwhy Fanon’s work so exceeds page count and number of books. To\nhave located and described the colonized subject under colonial\ndomination with such precision and texture—this is Fanon’s\ngift to scholars, for sure, but more than that it is his gift to all\nwho are engaged in radical struggle against racialized oppression.","contact.mail":"jdrabinski@amherst.edu","contact.domain":"amherst.edu"}]
