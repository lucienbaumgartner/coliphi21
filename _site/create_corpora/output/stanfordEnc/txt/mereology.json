Mereology occupies a\nprominent role also in the writings of medieval ontologists and\nscholastic philosophers such as Garland the Computist, Peter Abelard,\nThomas Aquinas, Raymond Lull, John Duns Scotus, Walter Burley, William\nof Ockham, and Jean Buridan, as well as in Jungius's Logica\nHamburgensis (1638), Leibniz's Dissertatio de arte\ncombinatoria (1666) and Monadology (1714), and Kant's\nearly writings (the Gedanken of 1747 and the Monadologia\nphysica of 1756). As a formal theory of parthood relations,\nhowever, mereology made its way into our times mainly through the work\nof Franz Brentano and of his pupils, especially Husserl's third\nLogical Investigation (1901). The latter may rightly be\nconsidered the first attempt at a thorough formulation of a theory,\nthough in a format that makes it difficult to disentangle the analysis\nof mereological concepts from that of other ontologically relevant\nnotions (such as the relation of ontological\n dependence).[2]\n It is not until Leśniewski's Foundations of the General\nTheory of Sets (1916) and his Foundations of Mathematics\n(1927–1931) that a pure theory of part-relations was given an\nexact\n formulation.[3]\n And because Leśniewski's work was largely inaccessible to\nnon-speakers of Polish, it is only with the publication of Leonard and\nGoodman's The Calculus of Individuals (1940), partly under\nthe influence of Whitehead, that mereology has become a chapter of\ncentral interest for modern ontologists and\n metaphysicians.[4]\n \n\nIn the following we focus mostly on contemporary formulations of\nmereology as they grew out of these recent\ntheories—Leśniewski's and Leonard and Goodman's. Indeed,\nalthough such theories come in different logical guises, they are\nsufficiently similar to be recognized as a common basis for most\nsubsequent developments. To properly assess the relative strengths and\nweaknesses, however, it will be convenient to proceed in steps. First\nwe consider some core mereological notions and principles. Then we\nproceed to an examination of the stronger theories that can be erected\non that basis.\n\nA preliminary caveat is in order. It concerns the very notion of\n‘part’ that mereology is about, which does not have an\nexact counterpart in ordinary language. Broadly speaking, in English\nwe can use ‘part’ to indicate any portion of a given\nentity. The portion may itself be attached to the remainder, as in\n(1), or detached, as in (2); it may be cognitively or functionally\nsalient, as in (1)–(2), or arbitrarily demarcated, as in (3);\nself-connected, as in (1)–(3), or disconnected, as in (4);\nhomogeneous or otherwise well-matched, as in (1)–(4), or\ngerrymandered, as in (5); material, as in (1)–(5), or\nimmaterial, as in (6); extended, as in (1)–(6), or unextended,\nas in (7); spatial, as in (1)–(7), or temporal, as in (8); and\nso on. \nAll of these uses illustrate the general notion of ‘part’\nthat forms the focus of mereology, regardless of any internal\ndistinctions. (For more examples and tentative taxonomies, see Winston\net al. 1987, Iris et al. 1988, Gerstl and Pribbenow\n1995, Pribbenow 2002, Westerhoff 2004, and Simons 2013.) Sometimes,\nhowever, the English word is used in a more restricted sense. For\ninstance, it can be used to designate only the cognitively salient\nrelation of parthood illustrated in (1), the relevant notion of\nsalience being determined by Gestalt factors (Rescher and Oppenheim\n1955; Bower and Glass 1976; Palmer 1977) or other perceptual and\ncognitive factors at large (Tversky 2005). Or it may designate only\nthe functional relation reflected in the parts list included in the\nuser's manual of a machine, or of a ready-to-assemble product, as in\n(2), in which case the parts of an object x are just its\n“components”, i.e., those parts that are available as\nindividual units regardless of their actual interaction with the other\nparts of x. (A component is a part of an object,\nrather than just part of it; see e.g. Tversky 1989, Simons\nand Dement 1996.) Clearly, the properties of such restricted relations\nmay not coincide with those of parthood understood more broadly, and\nit will be apparent that pure mereology is only concerned with the\nlatter.  \nOn the other hand, the English word ‘part’ is sometimes\nused in a broader sense, too, for instance to designate the relation\nof material constitution, as in (9), or the relation of mixture\ncomposition, as in (10), or the relation of group membership, as in\n(11): \nThe mereological status of these relations, however, is controversial.\nFor instance, although the constitution relation exemplified in (9)\nwas included by Aristotle in his threefold taxonomy of parthood\n(Metaphysics, Δ, 1023b), many contemporary authors\nwould rather construe it as a sui generis, non-mereological\nrelation (see e.g. Wiggins 1980, Rea 1995, Baker 1997, Evnine 2011) or\nelse as the relation of identity (Noonan 1993, Pickel 2010), possibly\ncontingent or occasional identity (Gibbard 1975, Robinson 1982,\nGallois 1998). Similarly, the ingredient-mixture relationship\nexemplified in (10) is of dubious mereological status, as the\ningredients may undergo significant chemical transformations that\nalter the structural characteristics they have in isolation (Sharvy\n1983, Bogen 1995, Fine 1995a, Needham 2007). As for cases such as\n(11), there is disagreement concerning whether teams and other groups\nshould be regarded as genuine mereological wholes, and while there are\nphilosophers who do think so (from Oppenheim and Putnam 1958 to\nQuinton 1976, Copp 1984, Martin 1988, and Sheehy 2006), many are\ninclined to regard groups as entities of a different sort and to\nconstrue the relation of group membership as distinct from parthood\n(see e.g. Simons 1980, Ruben 1983, Gilbert 1989, Meixner 1997,\nUzquiano 2004, Effingham 2010b, and Ritchie 2013 for different\nproposals). For all these reasons, here we shall take mereology to be\nconcerned mainly with the principles governing the relation\nexemplified in (1)–(8), leaving it open whether one or more such\nbroader uses of ‘part’ may themselves be subjected to\nmereological treatments of some sort.  \nFinally, it is worth stressing that mereology assumes no ontological\nrestriction on the field of ‘part’. In principle, the\nrelata can be as different as material bodies, events, geometric\nentities, or spatio-temporal regions, as in (1)–(8), as well as\nabstract entities such as properties, propositions, types, or kinds,\nas in the following examples: \nThis is not uncontentious. For instance, to some philosophers the\nthought that such abstract entities may be structured mereologically\ncannot be reconciled with their being universals. To adapt an example\nfrom Lewis (1986a), if the letter-type ‘m’ is part of the\nword-type ‘mereology’, then so is the letter-type\n‘e’. But there are two occurrences of ‘e’ in\n‘mereology’. Shall we say that the letter is part of the\nword twice over? Likewise, if carbon is part of\nmethane, then so is hydrogen. But each methane\nmolecule consists of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Shall we\nsay that hydrogen is part of methane four times\nover? What could that possibly mean? How can one thing be part of\nanother more than once? These are pressing questions, and the friend\nof structured universals may want to respond by conceding that the\nrelevant building relation is not parthood but, rather, a\nnon-mereological mode of composition (Armstrong 1986, 1988). However,\nother options are open, including some that take the difficulty at\nface value from a mereological standpoint (see e.g. Bigelow and\nPargetter 1989, Hawley 2010, Mormann 2010, Bader 2013, and Forrest\n2013, forthcoming; see also D. Smith 2009: §4, K. Bennett 2013,\nFisher 2013, and Cotnoir 2013b: §4, 2015 for explicit discussion\nof the idea of being part-related “many times over”).\nWhether such options are viable may be controversial. Yet their\navailability bears witness to the full generality of the notion of\nparthood that mereology seeks to characterize. In this sense, the\npoint to be stressed is metaphilosophical. For while Leśniewski's\nand Leonard and Goodman's original formulations betray a nominalistic\nstand, reflecting a conception of mereology as an ontologically\nparsimonious alternative to set theory, there is no necessary link\nbetween the analysis of parthood relations and the philosophical\nposition of\n nominalism.[5]\n As a formal theory (in Husserl's sense of ‘formal’, i.e.,\nas opposed to ‘material’) mereology is simply an attempt\nto lay down the general principles underlying the relationships\nbetween an entity and its constituent parts, whatever the nature of\nthe entity, just as set theory is an attempt to lay down the\nprinciples underlying the relationships between a set and its members.\nUnlike set theory, mereology is not committed to the existence of\nabstracta: the whole can be as concrete as the parts. But\nmereology carries no nominalistic commitment to concreta\neither: the parts can be as abstract as the whole. \nWhether this way of conceiving of mereology as a general and\ntopic-neutral theory holds water is a question that will not be\nfurther addressed here. It will, however, be in the background of much\nthat follows. Likewise, little will be said about the important\nquestion of whether one should countenance different (primitive)\npart-whole relations to hold among different kinds of entity (as urged\ne.g. by Sharvy 1980, McDaniel 2004, 2009, and Mellor 2006), or perhaps\neven among entities of the same kind (Fine 1994, 2010). Such a\nquestion will nonetheless be relevant to the assessment of certain\nmereological principles discussed below, whose generality may be\nclaimed to hold only in a restricted sense, or on a limited\nunderstanding of ‘part’. For further issues concerning the\nalleged universality and topic-neutrality of mereology, see also\nJohnston (2005, 2006), Varzi (2010), Donnelly (2011), Hovda (2014),\nand Johansson (2015). (Some may even think that there are no parthood\nrelations whatsoever, e.g., because there are there are no causally\ninert non-logical properties or relations, and parthood would be one\nsuch; for a defense of this sort of mereological anti-realism, see\nCowling 2014.) \nWith these provisos, and barring for the moment the complications\narising from the consideration of intensional factors (such as time\nand modalities), we may proceed to review some core mereological\nnotions and principles. Ideally, we may distinguish here between (a)\nthose principles that are simply meant to fix the intended meaning of\nthe relational predicate ‘part’, and (b) a variety of\nadditional, more substantive principles that go beyond the obvious and\naim at greater sophistication and descriptive power. Exactly where the\nboundary between (a) and (b) should be drawn, however, or even whether\na boundary of this sort can be drawn at all, is by itself a matter of\ncontroversy.  \nThe usual starting point is this: regardless of how one feels about\nmatters of ontology, if ‘part’ stands for the general\nrelation exemplified by (1)–(8) above, and perhaps also\n(12)–(15), then it stands for a partial ordering—a\nreflexive, transitive, antisymmetric relation: \nAs it turns out, most theories put forward in the literature accept\n(16)–(18). Some misgivings are nonetheless worth mentioning that\nmay, and occasionally have been, raised against these principles. \nConcerning reflexivity (16), two sorts of worry may be distinguished.\nThe first is that many legitimate senses of ‘part’ just\nfly in the face of saying that a whole is part of itself. For\ninstance, Rescher (1955) famously objected to Leonard and Goodman's\ntheory on these grounds, citing the biologists' use of\n‘part’ for the functional subunits of an organism as a\ncase in point: no organism is a functional subunit of itself. This is\na legitimate worry, but it appears to be of little import. Taking\nreflexivity (and antisymmetry) as constitutive of the meaning of\n‘part’ simply amounts to regarding identity as a limit\n(improper) case of parthood. A stronger relation, whereby nothing\ncounts as part of itself, can obviously be defined in terms of the\nweaker one, hence there is no loss of generality (see Section 2.2\nbelow). Vice versa, one could frame a mereological theory by taking\nproper parthood as a primitive instead. As already Lejewski (1957)\nnoted, this is merely a question of choosing a suitable primitive, so\nnothing substantive follows from it. (Of course, if one thinks that\nthere are or might be objects that are not self-identical,\nfor instance because of the loss of individuality in the quantum\nrealm, or for whatever other reasons, then such objects would not be\npart of themselves either, yielding genuine counterexamples to (16).\nHere, however, we stick to a notion of identity that obeys traditional\nwisdom, which is to say a notion whereby identity is an equivalence\nrelation subject to Leibniz's law.) The second sort of worry is more\nserious, for it constitutes a genuine challenge to the idea that (16)\nexpresses a principle that is somehow constitutive of the meaning of\n‘part’, as opposed to a substantive metaphysical thesis\nabout parthood. Following Kearns (2011), consider for instance a\nscenario in which an enduring wall, W, is shrunk down to the size of a\nbrick and eventually brought back in time so as to be used to build\n(along with other bricks) the original W. Or suppose wall W is\nbilocated to my left and my right, and I shrink it to the size of a\nbrick on the left and then use it to replace a brick from W on the\nright. In such cases, one might think that W is part of itself in a\nsense in which ordinary walls are not, hence that either parthood is\nnot reflexive or proper parthood is not irreflexive. For another\nexample (also by Kearns), if shapes are construed as abstract\nuniversals, then self-similar shapes such as fractals may very well be\nsaid to contain themselves as parts in a sense in which other shapes\ndo not. Whether such scenarios are indeed possible is by itself a\ncontroversial issue, as it depends on a number of background\nmetaphysical questions concerning persistence through time, location\nin space, and the nature of shapes. But precisely insofar as the\nscenarios are not obviously impossible, the generality and\nmetaphysical neutrality of (16) may be questioned. (Note that those\nscenarios also provide reasons to question the generality of many\nother claims that underlie the way we ordinarily talk, such as the\nclaim that nothing can be larger than itself, or\nnext to itself, or qualitatively different from\nitself. Such claims might be even more entrenched in common sense than\nthe claim that proper parthood is irreflexive, and parthood reflexive;\nyet this is hardly a reason to hang on to them at every cost. It\nsimply shows that our ordinary talk does not take into account\nsituations that are—admittedly—extraordinary.) \nSimilar considerations apply to the transitivity principle, (17). On\nthe one hand, several authors have observed that many legitimate\nsenses of ‘part’ are non-transitive, fostering the study\nof mereologies in which (17) may fail (Pietruszczak 2014). Examples\nwould include: (i) a biological subunit of a cell is not a part of the\norgan(ism) of which that cell is a part; (ii) a handle can be part of\na door and the door of a house, though a handle is never part of a\nhouse; (iii) my fingers are part of me and I am part of the team, yet\nmy fingers are not part of the team. (See again Rescher 1955 along\nwith Cruse 1979 and Winston et al. 1987, respectively; for\nother examples see Iris et al. 1988, Moltmann 1997, Hossack\n2000, Johnston 2002, 2005, Johansson 2004, 2006, and Fiorini et\nal. 2014). Arguably, however, such misgivings stem again from the\nambiguity of the English word ‘part’. What counts as a\nbiological subunit of a cell may not count as a subunit, i.e., a\ndistinguished part of the organ, but that is not to say that\nit is not part of the organ at all. Similarly, if there is a sense of\n‘part’ in which a handle is not part of the house to which\nit belongs, or my fingers not part of my team, it is a restricted\nsense: the handle is not a functional part of the house,\nthough it is a functional part of the door and the door a functional\npart of the house; my fingers are not directly part of the\nteam, though they are directly part of me and I am directly part of\nthe team. (Concerning this last case, Uzquiano 2004: 136–137,\nSchmitt 2003: 34, and Effingham 2010b: 255 actually read (iii) as a\nreductio of the very idea that the group-membership relation\nis a genuine case of parthood, as mentioned above ad (11).)\nIt is obvious that if the interpretation of ‘part’ is\nnarrowed by additional conditions, e.g., by requiring that parts make\na functional or direct contribution to the whole, then transitivity\nmay fail. In general, if x is a φ-part of y and\ny is a φ-part of z, x need not be a\nφ-part of z: the predicate modifier ‘φ’\nmay not distribute over parthood. But that shows the non-transitivity\nof ‘φ-part’, not of ‘part’, and within a\nsufficiently general framework this can easily be expressed with the\nhelp of explicit predicate modifiers (Varzi 2006a; Vieu 2006; Garbacz\n2007). On the other hand, there is again a genuine worry that,\nregardless of any ambiguity concerning the intended interpretation of\n‘part’, (17) expresses a substantive metaphysical thesis\nand cannot, therefore, be taken for granted. For example, it turns out\nthat time-travel and multi-location scenarios such as those mentioned\nin relation to (16) may also result in violations of the transitivity\nof both parthood (Effingham 2010a) and proper parthood (Gilmore 2009;\nKleinschmidt 2011). And the same could be said of cases that involve\nno such exotica. For instance, Gilmore (2014) brings\nattention to the popular theory of structured propositions originated\nwith Russell (1903). Already Frege (1976: 79) pointed out that if the\nconstituents of a proposition are construed mereologically as (proper)\nparts, then we have a problem: assuming that Mount Etna is literally\npart of the proposition that Etna is higher than Vesuvius, each\nindividual piece of solidified lava that is part of Etna would also be\npart of that proposition, which is absurd. The worse for Russell's\ntheory of structured propositions, said Frege. The worse, one could\nreply, for the transitivity of parthood (short of claiming that the\nargument involves yet another equivocation on ‘part\nof’). \nConcerning the antisymmetry postulate (18), the picture is even more\ncomplex. For one thing, some authors maintain that the relationship\nbetween an object and the stuff it is made of provides a perfectly\nordinary counterexample of the antisymmetry of parthood: according to\nThomson (1998), for example, a statue and the clay that constitutes it\nare part of each other, yet distinct. This is not a popular view: as\nalready mentioned, most contemporary authors would either deny that\nmaterial constitution is a relation of parthood or else treat it as\nimproper parthood, i.e., identity, which is trivially\nantisymmetric (and symmetric). Moreover, those who regard constitution\nas a genuine case of proper parthood tend to follow Aristotle's\nhylomorphic conception and deny that the relation also holds in the\nopposite direction: the clay is part of the statue but not vice versa\n(see e.g. Haslanger 1994, Koslicki 2008). Still, insofar as Thomson's\nview is a legitimate option, it represents a challenge to the putative\ngenerality of (18). Second, one may wonder about the possibility of\nunordinary cases of symmetric parthood relationships. Sanford\n(1993: 222) refers to Borges's Aleph as a case in point: “I saw\nthe earth in the Aleph and in the earth the Aleph once more and the\nearth in the Aleph …”. In this case, a plausible reply is\nsimply that fiction delivers no guidance to conceptual investigations:\nconceivability may well be a guide to possibility, but literary\nfantasy is by itself no evidence of conceivability (van Inwagen 1993:\n229). Perhaps the same could be said of Fazang's Jeweled Net of Indra,\nin which each jewel has every other jewel as part (Jones 2012).\nHowever, other cases seem harder to dismiss. Surely the Scholastics\nwere not merely engaging in literary fiction when arguing that each\nperson of the Trinity is a proper part of God, and yet also identical\nwith God (see e.g. Abelard, Theologia christiana, bk. III).\nAnd arguably time travel is at least conceivable, in which case again\n(18) could fail: if time-traveling wall W ends up being one of the\nbricks that compose (say) its own bottom half, H, then we have a\nconceivable scenario in which W is part of H and H is part of W while\nW ≠ H (Kleinschmidt 2011). Third, it may be argued that\nantisymmetry is also at odds with theories that have been found\nacceptable on quite independent grounds. Consider again the theory of\nstructured propositions. If A is the proposition that the\nuniverse exists—where the universe is something of which\neverything is part—and if A is true, then on such a\ntheory the universe would be a proper part of A; and since\nA would in turn be a proper part of U, antisymmetry would be\nforfeit (Tillman and Fowler 2012). Likewise, if A is the\nproposition that B is true, and B the proposition\nthat A is contingent, then again A and B\nwould be part of each other even though A ≠ B\n(Cotnoir 2013b). Finally, and more generally, it may be observed that\nthe possibility of mereological loops is to be taken seriously for the\nsame sort of reasons that led to the development of non-well-founded\nset theory, i.e., set theory tolerating cases of self-membership and,\nmore generally, of membership circularities (Aczel 1988; Barwise and\nMoss 1996). This is especially significant in view of the possibility\nof reformulating set theory itself in mereological terms—a\npossibility that is extensively worked out in the works of Bunt (1985)\nand especially Lewis (1991, 1993b) (see also Burgess 2015 and Hamkins\nand Kikuchi forthcoming). For all these reasons, the antisymmetry\npostulate (18) can hardly be regarded as constitutive of the basic\nmeaning of ‘part’, and some authors have begun to engage\nin the systematic study of “non-well-founded mereologies”\nin which (18) may fail (Cotnoir 2010; Cotnoir and Bacon 2012; Obojska\n2013).  \nIn the following we aim at a critical survey of mereology as\nstandardly understood, so we shall mainly confine ourselves to\ntheories that do in fact accept the antisymmetry postulate along with\nboth reflexivity and transitivity. However, the above considerations\nshould not be dismissed. On the contrary, they are crucially relevant\nin assessing the scope of mereology and the degree to which its\nstandard formulations and extensions betray intuitions that may be\nfound too narrow, false, or otherwise problematic. Indeed, they are\ncrucially relevant also in assessing the ideal desideratum mentioned\nat the beginning of this section—the desideratum of a neat\ndemarcation between core principles that are simply meant to fix the\nintended meaning of ‘part’ and principles that reflect\nmore substantive theses concerning the parthood relation. Classical\nmereology takes the former to include the threefold claim that\n‘part’ stands for a reflexive, transitive and\nantisymmetric relation, but this is not to say that “anyone who\nseriously disagrees with them had failed to understand the word”\n(Simons 1987: 11), just as departure from the basic principles of\nclassical logic need not amount to a “change of subject”\n(Quine 1970: 81). And just as the existence of widespread and\ndiversified disagreement concerning the laws of logic may lead one to\nconclude that “for all we know, the only inference left in the\nintersection of (unrestricted) all logics might be the\nidentity inference: From A to infer\nA” (Beall and Restall 2006: 92), so one might take the\nabove considerations and the corresponding development of\nnon-classical mereologies to indicate that there may be “no\nreason to assume that any useful core mereology […] functions\nas a common basis for all plausible metaphysical theories”\n(Donnelly 2011: 246). \nIt is convenient at this point to introduce some degree of\nformalization. This avoids ambiguities stemming from ordinary language\nand facilitates comparisons and developments. For definiteness, we\nassume here a standard first-order language with identity, supplied\nwith a distinguished binary predicate constant, ‘P’, to be\ninterpreted as the parthood\n relation.[6]\n Taking the underlying logic to be the classical predicate calculus\nwith\n identity,[7]\n the requisites on parthood discussed in Section 2.1 may then be\nregarded as forming a first-order theory characterized by the\nfollowing proper axioms for ‘P’: \n(Here and in the following we simplify notation by dropping all\ninitial universal quantifiers. Unless otherwise specified, all\nformulas are to be understood as universally closed.) We may call such\na theory Core Mereology—M for\n short[8]—since\n it represents the common starting point of all standard theories. \nGiven (P.1)–(P.3), a number of additional mereological\npredicates can be introduced by definition. For example: \nAn intuitive model for these relations, with ‘P’\ninterpreted as spatial inclusion, is given in Figure 1. \nNote that ‘Uxy’ is bound to hold if one assumes\nthe existence of a “universal entity” of which everything\nis part. Conversely, ‘Oxy’ would always hold if\none assumed the existence of a “null item” that is part of\neverything. Both assumptions, however, are controversial and we shall\ncome back to them below. \nNote also that the definitions imply (by pure logic) that EQ, O, and U\nare all reflexive and symmetric; in addition, EQ is also\ntransitive—an equivalence relation. By contrast, PP and PE are\nirreflexive and asymmetric, and it follows from (P.2) that both are\nalso transitive—so they are strict partial orderings. Since the\nfollowing biconditional is also a straightforward consequence of the\naxioms (specifically, of P.1), \nit should now be obvious that one could in fact use proper parthood as\nan alternative starting point for the development of classical\nmereology, using the right-hand side of (24) as a definiens for\n‘P’. This is, for instance, the option followed in Simons\n(1987), as also in Leśniewski’s original theory (1916),\nwhere the partial ordering axioms for ‘P’ are replaced by\nthe strict ordering axioms for\n ‘PP’.[9]\n Ditto for ‘PE’, which was in fact the primitive relation\nin Whitehead's (1919) semi-formal treatment of the mereology of events\n(and which is just the converse of ‘PP’). Other options\nare in principle possible, too. For example, Goodman (1951) used\n‘O’ as a primitive and Leonard and Goodman (1940) used its\n opposite:[10] \nHowever, the relations corresponding to such predicates are strictly\nweaker than PP and PE and no biconditional is provable in\nM that would yield a corresponding definiens of\n‘P’ (though one could define ‘P’ in terms of\n‘O’ or ‘D’ in the presence of further axioms;\nsee below ad (61)). Thus, other things being equal,\n‘P’, ‘PP’, and ‘PE’ appear to be\nthe only reasonable options. Here we shall stick to ‘P’,\nreferring to J. Parsons (2014) for further discussion. \nFinally, note that identity could itself be introduced by definition,\ndue to the following obvious consequence of the antisymmetry postulate\n(P.3): \nAccordingly, theory M could be formulated in a pure\nfirst-order language by assuming (P.1) and (P.2) and replacing (P.3)\nwith the following variant of the Leibniz axiom schema for identity\n(where φ is any formula in the language): \nOne may in fact argue on these grounds that the parthood relation is\nin some sense conceptually prior to the identity relation (as in\nSharvy 1983: 234), and since ‘EQ’ is not definable in\nterms of ‘PP’ or ‘PE’ alone except in the\npresence of stronger axioms (see below ad (27)), the argument\nwould also provide evidence in favor of ‘P’ as the most\nfundamental primitive. As we shall see in Section 3.2, however, the\nlink between parthood and identity is philosophically problematic. In\norder not to compromise our exposition, we shall therefore keep to a\nlanguage containing both ‘P’ and ‘=’ as\nprimitives. This will also be convenient in view of the previous\nremarks concerning the controversial status of Antisymmetry, on which\n(26) depends. \nThe last remark is also relevant to the definition of ‘PP’\ngiven above. That is the classical definition used by Leśniewski\nand by Leonard and Goodman and corresponds verbatim to the intuitive\ncharacterization of proper parthood used in the previous section.\nHowever, in some treatments (including earlier versions of this\n entry[11]),\n ‘PP’ is defined directly in terms of ‘P’,\nwithout using identity, as per the following variant of (20): \n(See e.g. Goodman 1951: 35; Eberle 1967: 272; Simons 1991a: 286;\nCasati and Varzi 1999: 36; Niebergall 2011: 274). Similarly for\n‘PE’. In M the difference is immaterial,\nsince the relevant definientia are provably equivalent. But the\nequivalence in question depends crucially on Antisymmetry. Absent\n(P.3), the second definition is strictly stronger: any two things that\nare mutually P-related would count as proper parts of each other\naccording to (20) but not, obviously, according to (20′), which\nforces PP to be asymmetric. Indeed, in the presence of (P.1) and (P.2)\nthe latter definition is still strong enough to deliver a strict\npartial ordering, whereas (20) does not even yield a transitive\nrelation unless (P.3) is\n assumed.[12]\n Another important difference is that, absent (P.3), the biconditional\nin (24) continues to hold only if ‘PP’ is defined as in\n(20); if (20′) is used instead, the left-to-right direction\nfails whenever x and y are distinct mutual parts. In\nview of the above remarks concerning the doubtful status of (P.3), it\nis therefore convenient to work with the weaker definition. Standardly\nit makes no difference, but some of the definitions and results\npresented below would not extend to non-well-founded mereology if\n(20′) were used instead. (See e.g. Cotnoir 2010 and Gilmore\n2016.) Furthermore, since both definitions force PP to be irreflexive,\nit should be noted that the only way to develop a non-well-founded\nmereology that allows for strict mereological loops, i.e., things that\nare proper part of themselves, is to rely on yet another definition or\nelse take ‘PP’ as a primitive (as in Cotnoir and Bacon\n2012, where PP is axiomatized as transitive but neither irreflexive\nnor asymmetric). \nM is standardly viewed as embodying the common core\nof any mereological theory. Not just any partial ordering qualifies as\na part-whole relation, though, and establishing what further\nprinciples should be added to (P.1)–(P.3) is precisely the\nquestion a good mereological theory is meant to answer. It is here\nthat philosophical issues begin to multiply, over and above the\ngeneral concerns mentioned in Section 2.1. \nGenerally speaking, such further principles may be divided into two\nmain groups. On the one hand, one may extend M by\nmeans of decomposition principles that take us from a whole\nto its parts. For example, one may consider the idea that whenever\nsomething has a proper part, it has more than one—i.e., that\nthere is always some mereological difference (a\n“remainder”) between a whole and its proper parts. This\nneed not be true in every model for M: a world with\nonly two items, only one of which is part of the other, would be a\ncounterexample, though not one that could be illustrated with the sort\nof geometric diagram used in Figure 1. On the other hand, one may\nextend M by means of composition principles\nthat go in the opposite direction—from the parts to the whole.\nFor example, one may consider the idea that whenever there are some\nthings, there exists a whole that consists exactly of those\nthings—i.e., that there is always a mereological sum\n(or “fusion”) of two or more parts. Again, this need not\nbe true in a model for M, and it is a matter of much\ncontroversy whether the idea should hold unrestrictedly.  \nLet us begin with the first sort of extension. And let us start by\ntaking a closer look at the intuition according to which a whole\ncannot be decomposed into a single proper part. There are various ways\nin which one can try to capture this intuition. Consider the following\n(from Simons 1987: 26–28): \nThe first principle, (P.4a), is a literal rendering of the\nidea in question: every proper part must be accompanied by another.\nHowever, there is an obvious sense in which (P.4a) only\ncaptures the letter of the idea, not the spirit: it rules out the\nunintended model mentioned above (see Figure 2, left) but not, for\nexample, an implausible model with an infinitely descending chain in\nwhich the additional proper parts do not leave any remainder at all\n(Figure 2, center).  \nThe second principle, (P.4b), is stronger: it rules out\nboth models as unacceptable. However, (P.4b) is still too\nweak to capture the intended idea. For example, it is satisfied by a\nmodel in which a whole can be decomposed into several proper parts all\nof which overlap one another (Figure 2, right), and it may be argued\nthat such models do not do justice to the meaning of ‘proper\npart’: after all, the idea is that the removal of a proper part\nshould leave a remainder, but it is by no means clear what would be\nleft of x once z (along with its parts) is\nremoved. \nIt is only the third principle, (P.4), that appears to provide a full\nformulation of the idea that a whole cannot be decomposed into a\nsingle proper part. According to this principle, every proper part\nmust be “supplemented” by another, disjoint part,\nand it is this last qualification that captures the notion of a\nremainder. Should (P.4), then, be incorporated into M\nas a further fundamental principle on the meaning of\n‘part’?  \nMost authors (beginning with Simons himself) would say so. Yet here\nthere is room for genuine disagreement. In fact, it is not difficult\nto conceive of mereological scenarios that violate not only (P.4), but\nalso (P.4b) and even (P.4a). A case in point\nwould be Brentano's (1933) theory of accidents, according to which a\nmind is a proper part of a thinking mind even though there is nothing\nto make up for the difference. (See Chisholm 1978, Baumgartner and\nSimons 1993.) Similarly, in Fine's (1982) theory of\nqua-objects, every basic object (John) qualifies as the only\nproper part of its incarnations (John qua philosopher, John\nqua husband, etc.). Another interesting example is provided\nby Whitehead's (1929) theory of extensive connection, where no\nboundary elements are included in the domain of quantification: on\nthis theory, a topologically closed region includes its open interior\nas a proper part in spite of there being no boundary elements to\ndistinguish them—the domain only consists of extended regions.\n(See Clarke 1981 for a rigorous formulation, Randell et al.\n1992 for developments.) Finally, consider the view, arguably held by\nAquinas, according to which the human person survives physical death\nalong with her soul (see Brown 2005 and Stump 2006, pace\nToner 2009). On the understanding that persons are hylomorphic\ncomposites, and that two things cannot become one, the view implies\nthat upon losing her body a person will continue to exist,\npre-resurrection, with only one proper part—the soul. (This is\nalso the view of some contemporary philosophers; see e.g. Oderberg\n2005 and Hershenov and Koch-Hershenov 2006.) Indeed, any case of\nmaterial coincidence resulting from mereological diminution, as in the\nStoic puzzle of Deon and Theon (Sedley 1982) and its modern variant of\nTibbles and Tib (Wiggins 1968), would seem to be at odds with\nSupplementation: after the diminution, there is nothing that makes up\nfor the difference between what was a proper part and the whole with\nwhich it comes to coincide, short of holding that the part has become\nidentical to the whole (Gallois 1998), or has ceased to exist (Burke\n1994), or did not exist in the first place (van Inwagen 1981). One may\nrely on the intuitive appeal of (P.4) to discard all of the above\ntheories and scenarios as implausible. But one may as well turn things\naround and regard the plausibility of such theories as a good reason\nnot to accept (P.4) unrestrictedly, as argued e.g. by D. Smith (2009),\nOderberg (2012), and Lowe (2013). As things stand, it therefore seems\nappropriate to regard such a principle as providing a minimal but\nsubstantive addition to (P.1)–(P.3), one that goes beyond the\nbasic characterization of ‘part’ provided by\nM. We shall label the resulting mereological theory\nMM, for Minimal Mereology. \nActually MM is now redundant, as Supplementation\nturns out to entail Antisymmetry so long as parthood is transitive and\nreflexive: if x and y were proper parts of each\nother, contrary to (P.3), then every z that is part of one\nwould also be part of—hence overlap—the other, contrary to\n(P.4). For ease of reference, we shall continue to treat (P.3) as an\naxiom. But the entailment is worth emphasizing, for it explains why\nSupplementation tends to be explicitly rejected by those who\ndo not endorse Antisymmetry, over and above the more classical\nexamples mentioned above. For instance, whoever thinks that a statue\nand the corresponding lump of clay are part of each other will find\nSupplementation unreasonable: after all, such parts are coextensive;\nwhy should we expect anything to be left over when, say, the clay is\n“subtracted” from the statue? (Donnelly 2011: 230).\nIndeed, Supplementation has recently run into trouble also\nindependently of its link with Antisymmetry, especially in the context\nof time-travel and multilocation scenarios such as those already\nmentioned in connection with each of (P.1)–(P.3) (see Effingham\nand Robson 2007, Gilmore 2007, Eagle 2010, Kleinschmidt 2011, Daniels\n2014). As a result, a question that is gaining increasing attention is\nwhether there are any ways of capturing the supplementation intuition\nthat are strong enough to rule out the models of Figure 2 and yet\nsufficiently weaker than (P.4) to be acceptable to those who do not\nendorse some M-axiom or other—be it\nAntisymmetry, Transitivity, or Reflexivity. \nTwo sorts of answer may be offered in this regard (see e.g. Gilmore\n2016). The first is to weaken the Supplementation conditional by\nstrengthening the antecedent. For instance, one may simply rephrase\n(P.4) in terms of the stricter notion of proper parthood defined in\n(20′), i.e., effectively: \nIn M this is equivalent to (P.4). Yet it is logically\nweaker, and it is easy to see that this suffices to block the\nentailment of (P.3) even in the presence of (P.1)–(P.2) (just\nconsider a two-element model with mutual parthood, as in Figure 3,\nleft). Still, (P.4c) is sufficiently stronger than\n(P.4a) and (P.4b) to rule out all three patterns\nin Figure 2, and it obviously preserves the spirit of (P.4)—if\nnot the letter. The second sort of answer is to weaken Supplementation\nby adjusting the consequent. There are various ways of doing this, the\nmost natural of which appears to be the following: \nAgain, this principle is stronger than (P.4a) and\n(P.4b), since it rules out all patterns in Figure 2, and in\nM it is equivalent to (P.4). Indeed,\n(P.4d) says, literally, that if something has a proper\npart, then it has at least two disjoint parts, which Simons\n(1987: 27) takes to express the same intuition captured by (P.4). Yet\n(P.4d) is logically weaker than (P.4), since it admits the\nnon-antisymmetric model in Figure 3, middle, and for that reason it\nmay be deemed more suitable in the context of theories that violate\n(P.3). Note also that (P.4d) does not admit the symmetric\nmodel on Figure 3, left, so in a way it is stronger than\n(P.4c). In another way, however, it is weaker, since it\nadmits the model in Figure 3, right, which (P.4c) rules out\n(and which someone who thinks that, say, the clay is part of the\nstatue, but not vice versa, might want to retain). \nThere are other options, too. For instance, in some standard\ntreatments, the Supplementation principle (P.4) is formulated using\n‘PP’ also in the consequent: \nIn M this is once again equivalent to (P.4), but the\nequivalence depends on Reflexivity and Symmetry. Absent (P.1) or\n(P.2), (P.4′) is logically stronger. Yet again one may rely on\nthe alternative definition of ‘PP’ to obtain variants of\n(P.4′) that are stronger than (P.4c) and weaker than\n(P.4). Similarly for (P.4d), which may be further weakened\nor strengthened by tampering with the parthood predicates occurring in\nthe antecedent and in the consequent. \nWe may also ask the opposite question: Are there any stronger ways of\nexpressing the supplementation intuition besides (P.4)? In classical\nmereology, the standard answer is in the affirmative, the main\ncandidate being the following: \nIntuitively, this says that if an object fails to include\nanother among its parts, then there must be a remainder, something\nthat makes up for the difference. It is easily seen that, given\nM, (P.5) implies (P.4), so any\nM-theory violating (P.4) will a fortiori\nviolate (P.5). For instance, on Whitehead's boundary-free theory of\nextensive connection, a closed region is not part of its interior even\nthough each part of the former overlaps the latter. More generally,\nthe entailment holds as long as parthood is antisymmetric (see again\nFigure 3, center, for a non-antisymmetric counterexample). However,\nthe converse is not true. The diagram in Figure 4 illustrates an\nM-model in which (P.4) is satisfied, since each\nproper part counts as a supplement of the other; yet (P.5) is\nfalse. \nThe theory obtained by adding (P.5) to (P.1)–(P.3) is thus a\nproper extension of MM. We label this stronger theory\nEM, for Extensional Mereology, the attribute\n‘extensional’ being justified precisely by the exclusion\nof countermodels that, like the one in Figure 4, contain distinct\nobjects with the same proper parts. In fact, it is a theorem of\nEM that no composite objects with the same\nproper parts can be distinguished: \n(The analogue for ‘P’ is already provable in\nM, since P is reflexive and antisymmetric.) This goes\nfar beyond the intuition that lies behind the basic Supplementation\nprinciple (P.4). Does it go too far? \nOn the face of it, it is not difficult to envisage scenarios that\nwould correspond to the diagram in Figure 4. For example, we may take\nx and y to be the sets {{z}, {z,\nw}} and {{w},{z, w}}, respectively\n(i.e., the ordered pairs ⟨z, w⟩ and\n⟨w, z⟩), interpreting ‘P’\nas the ancestral of the improper membership relation (i.e., of the\nunion of ∈ and =). But sets are abstract entities, and the\nancestral relation does not generally satisfy (P.4) (the singleton of\nthe empty set, for instance, or the singleton of any urelement, would\nhave only one proper part on the suggested construal of\n‘P’). Can we also envisage similar scenarios in the domain\nof concrete, spatially extended entities, granting (P.4) in its\ngenerality? Admittedly, it is difficult to picture two\nconcrete objects mereologically structured as in Figure 4. It is\ndifficult, for example, to draw two extended objects composed of the\nsame proper parts because drawing something is drawing its\nproper parts; once the parts are drawn, there is nothing left to be\ndone to get a drawing of the whole. Yet this only proves that pictures\nare biased towards (P.5). Are there any philosophical reasons to\nresist the extensional force of (P.5) beyond the domain of abstract\nentities, and in the presence of (P.4)? \nTwo sorts of reason are worth examining. On the one hand, it is\nsometimes argued that sameness of proper parts is not\nsufficient for identity. For example, it is argued that: (i)\ntwo words can be made up of the same letters (Hempel 1953: 110;\nRescher 1955: 10), two tunes of the same notes (Rosen and Dorr 2002:\n154), and so on; or (ii) the same flowers can compose a nice bunch or\na scattered bundle, depending on the arrangements of the individual\nflowers (Eberle 1970: §2.10); or (iii) two groups can have\nco-extensive memberships, say, the Library Committee and the\nPhilosophy Department football team (Simons 1987: 114; Gilbert 1989:\n273); or (iv) a cat must be distinguished from the corresponding\namount of feline tissue, for the former can survive the annihilation\nof certain parts (the tail, for instance) whereas the latter cannot by\ndefinition (Wiggins 1968; see also Doepke 1982, Lowe 1989, Johnston\n1992, Baker 1997, Meirav 2003, Sanford 2003, and Crane 2012, inter\nalia, for similar or related arguments). On the other hand, it is\nsometimes argued that sameness of parts is not necessary for\nidentity, as some entities may survive mereological change. If a cat\nsurvives the annihilation of its tail, then the tailed cat (before the\naccident) and the tailless cat (after the accident) are numerically\nthe same in spite of their having different proper parts (Wiggins\n1980). If any of these arguments is accepted, then clearly (27) is too\nstrong a principle to be imposed on the parthood relation. And since\n(27) follows from (P.5), it might be concluded that\nEM is on the wrong track. \nLet us look at these objections separately. Concerning the necessity\naspect of mereological extensionality, i.e., the left-to-right\nconditional in the consequent of (27), \nit is perhaps enough to remark that the difficulty is not peculiar to\nextensional mereology. The objection proceeds from the consideration\nthat ordinary entities such as cats and other living organisms (and\npossibly other entities as well, such as statues and ships) survive\nall sorts of gradual mereological change. This a legitimate thought,\nlest one be forced into some form of “mereological\nessentialism” (Chisholm 1973, 1975, 1976; Plantinga 1975;\nWiggins 1979). However, the same can be said of other types of change\nas well: bananas ripen, houses deteriorate, people sleep at night and\neat at lunch. How can we say that they are the same things, if they\nare not quite the same? Indeed, (28) is essentially an instance of the\nidentity axiom schema \nand it is well known that this axiom schema runs into trouble when\n‘=’ is given a diachronic reading. (See the entries on\n change\n and\n identity over time.)\n The problem is a general one. Whatever the solution, it will\ntherefore apply to the case at issue as well, and in this sense the\nabove-mentioned objection to (28) can be disregarded. For example, the\nproblem would dissolve immediately if the variables in (28) were taken\nto range over four-dimensional entities whose parts may extend in time\nas well as in space (Heller 1984, Lewis 1986b, Sider 2001), or if\nidentity itself were construed as a contingent relation that may hold\nat some times or worlds but not at others (Gibbard 1975, Myro 1985,\nGallois 1998). Alternatively, on a more traditional, three-dimensional\nconception of material objects, the problem of change is often\naccounted for by relativizing properties and relations to times,\nrewriting (ID) as \n(This may be understood in various ways; see e.g. the papers in\nHaslanger and Kurtz 2006, Part III.) If so, then again the specific\nworry about (28) would dissolve, as the relativized version of (P.5)\nwould only warrant the following variant of the conditional in\nquestion: \n(See Thomson 1983, Simons 1987: §5.2, Masolo 2009, Giaretta and\nSpolaore 2011; see also Kazmi 1990 and Hovda 2013 for tensed versions\nof this strategy.) The need to relativize parthood to time, and\nperhaps to other parameters such as space, possible worlds, etc., has\nrecently been motivated also on independent grounds, from the\nso-called “problem of the many” (Hudson 2001) to material\nconstitution (Bittner and Donnelly 2007), modal realism (McDaniel\n2004), vagueness (Donnelly 2009), relativistic spacetime (Balashov\n2008), or the general theory of location (Gilmore 2009, Donnelly\n2010). One way or the other, then, such revisions may be regarded as\nan indicator of the limited ontological neutrality of extensional\nmereology. But their independent motivation also bears witness to the\nfact that controversies about (28) stem from genuine and fundamental\nphilosophical conundrums and cannot be assessed by appealing to our\nintuitions about the meaning of ‘part’. \nThe worry about the sufficiency aspect of mereological extensionality,\ni.e., the right-to-left conditional in the consequent of (27), \nis more to the point. However, here too there are various ways of\nresponding on behalf of EM. Consider counterexample\n(i)—say, two words made up of the same letters, as in\n‘else’ and ‘seel’. If these are taken as\nword-types, a lot depends on how exactly one construes such things\nmereologically, and one might simply dismiss the challenge by\nrejecting, or improving on, the dime-store thought that word-types are\nletter-type composites (see above ad (14)). Indeed, if they\nwere, then word-types would not only violate extensionality, hence the\nStrong Supplementation principle (P.5); they would violate the basic\nSupplementation principle (P.4), since ‘seel’ (for\ninstance) would contain a proper part (the string ‘ee’)\nthat consists of a single proper part (the letter ‘e’). On\nthe other hand, if the items in question are taken as word-tokens,\nthen presumably they are made up of distinct letter-tokens, so again\nthere is no violation of (29), hence no reason to reject (P.5) on\nthese grounds. Of course, we may suppose that one of the two\nword-tokens is obtained from the other by rearranging the same\nletter-tokens. If so, however, the issue becomes once again one of\ndiachronic non-identity, with all that it entails, and it is not\nobvious that we have a counterexample to (29). (See Lewis 1991: 78f.)\nWhat if our letter-tokens are suitably arranged so as to form both\nwords at the same time? For example, suppose they are arranged in a\ncircle (Simons 1987: 114). In this case one might be inclined to say\nthat we have a genuine counterexample. But one may equally well insist\nthat we have got just one circular inscription that, curiously, can be\nread as two different words depending on where we start. Compare: I\ndraw a rabbit that to you looks like a duck. Have I thereby made two\ndrawings? I write ‘p’ on my office glass door; from the\noutside you read ‘q’. Have I therefore produced two\nletter-tokens? And what if Mary joins you and reads it upside down;\nhave I also written the letter ‘b’? Surely then I have\nalso written the letter ‘d’, as my upside-down office mate\nJohn points out. This multiplication of entities seems preposterous.\nThere is just one thing there, one inscription, and what it looks (or\nmean) to you or me or Mary or John is irrelevant to what that thing\nis. Similarly—it may be argued—there is just one\ninscription in our example, a circular display of four letter-tokens,\nand whether we read it as an ‘else’-inscription or a\n‘seel’-inscription is irrelevant to its mereological\nstructure. (Varzi 2008) \nCase (ii)—the flowers—is not significantly different. The\nsame, concrete flowers cannot compose a nice bunch and a scattered\nbundle at the same time. Similarly for many other cases of\nthis sort that may come to mind, including much less frivolous\nprima facie counterexamples offered by the natural\nsciences—from the different phases of matter (solids, liquids,\nand gases) to the different possibilities of chemical binding; see\ne.g. Harré and Llored (2011, 2013) and Sukumar (2013). (Not all\ncases are so easily dismissed, though. In particular, several\nauthors—from Maudlin 1998 to Krause 2011—have argued that\nthe world of quantum mechanics provides genuine type-(ii)\ncounterexamples to extensionality. A full treatment of such arguments\ngoes beyond the scope of this entry, but see e.g. Calosi et\nal. 2011 and Calosi and Tarozzi 2014 for counter-arguments.) \nCase (iii) is more delicate, as it depends on one's metaphysics of\nsuch things as committees, teams, and groups generally. If one denies\nthat the relevant structural relation is a genuine case of parthood\n(see Section 1, ad (11)), then of course the counterexample\nmisfires. If, on the other hand, one takes groups to be bona\nfide mereological composites—and composites consisting of\nenduring persons as opposed to, say, person-stages, as in Copp\n(1984)—then a lot depends on one's reasons to treat groups with\nco-extensive memberships as in fact distinct. Typically such reasons\nare just taken for granted, as if the distinctness were obvious. But\nsometimes informal arguments are offered to the effect that, say, the\ncoextensive Library Committee and football team must be distinguished\ninsofar as they have different persistence conditions, or different\nproperties broadly understood. For instance, the players of the team\ncan change even though the Committee remains the same, or one group\ncan be dismantled even though the other continues to operate, or one\ngroup has different legal obligations than the other, and so on (see\ne.g. Moltmann 1997). If so, then case (iii) becomes relevantly similar\nto case (iv). There, too, the intuition is that a living animal such\nas a cat is something “over and above” the mere lump of\nfeline tissue that constitutes its body—that they have different\nsurvival conditions and, hence, different properties—so it\nappears that here we have a genuine counterexample to mereological\nextensionality (via Leibniz's Law). It is for similar reasons that\nsome philosophers are inclined to treat a vase and the corresponding\nlump of clay as distinct in spite of their sharing the same proper\nparts—possibly even the same improper parts, contrary to (P.3),\nas seen in Section\n 2.2.[14]\n Two responses may nonetheless be offered in such cases on behalf of\nEM (besides rejecting the intuition in question on\nthe basis of a specific metaphysics of persistence). \nFocusing on (iv), the first response is to insist that, on the face of\nit, a cat and the corresponding lump of feline tissue (or a statue and\nthe lump of clay that constitutes it) do not share the same proper\nparts after all. For, on the one hand, if one believes that at least\none such thing, x, is part of the other, y, then it\nmust be a proper part; and insofar as nothing can be a proper part of\nitself, it follows immediately that such things do not in fact\nconstitute a counterexample to (29). (This would also follow from\nSupplementation, as emphasized e.g. in Olson 2006, since the\nassumption that x and y have the same proper parts\nentails that no part of y is disjoint from x, at\nleast so long as parthood is reflexive; but there is no need to invoke\n(P.4) here.) On the other hand, if one believes that neither\nx nor y is part of the other, then presumably the\nsame belief will also apply to some of their proper parts—say,\nthe cat's tail and the corresponding lump of tissue. And if the tail\nis not part of that lump, then presumably it is also not part\nof the larger lump of tissue that constitutes the whole cat (as\nexplicitly acknowledged by some anti-extensionalists, e.g. Lowe 2001:\n148 and Fine 2003: 198, n. 5, though see Hershenov 2008 for\nmisgivings). Thus, again, it would appear that x and\ny do not have the same proper parts after all and do not,\ntherefore, constitute a counterexample to (29). (For more on this line\nof argument, see Varzi 2008.) \nThe second and more general response on behalf of EM\nis that the appeal to Leibniz's law in this context is illegitimate.\nLet ‘Tibbles’ name our cat and ‘Tail’ its\ntail, and grant the truth of \nThere is, indeed, an intuitive sense in which the following is also\ntrue: \nHowever, this intuitive sense corresponds to a de dicto\nreading of the modality, where the definite description in (31) has\nnarrow scope: \nOn this reading, (31) is hardly negotiable. Yet this is irrelevant in\nthe present context, for (31a) does not amount to an ascription of a\nmodal property and cannot be used in connection with Leibniz's law.\n(Compare: 8 is necessarily even; the number of planets might have been\nodd; hence the number of planets is not 8.) On the other hand,\nconsider a de re reading of (31), where the definite\ndescription has wide scope: \nOn this reading, the appeal to Leibniz's law would be legitimate\n(modulo any concerns about the status of modal properties) and one\ncould rely on the truth of (30) and (31) (i.e., (31b)) to conclude\nthat Tibbles is distinct from the relevant lump of feline tissue.\nHowever, there is no obvious reason why (31) should be regarded as\ntrue on this reading. That is, there is no obvious reason to suppose\nthat the lump of feline tissue that in the actual world constitutes\nTail and the rest of Tibbles's body—that lump of feline\ntissue that is now resting on the carpet—cannot survive the\nannihilation of Tail. Indeed, it would appear that any reason in favor\nof this claim vis-à-vis the truth of (30) would have\nto presuppose the distinctness of the entities in question,\nso no appeal to Leibniz's law would be legitimate to\ndetermine the distinctess (on pain of circularity). This is\nnot to say that the putative counterexample to (29) is wrong-headed.\nBut it requires genuine metaphysical work to establish it and it makes\nthe rejection of extensionality, and with it the rejection of the\nStrong Supplementation principle (P.5), a matter of genuine\nphilosophical controversy. (Similar remarks would apply to any\nargument intended to reject extensionality on the basis of competing\nmodal intuitions regarding the possibility of mereological\nrearrangement, rather than mereological change, as\nwith the flowers example. On a de re reading, the claim that\na bunch of flowers could not survive rearrangement of the\nparts—while the aggregate of the individual flowers composing it\ncould—must be backed up by a genuine metaphysical theory about\nthose entities. For more on this general line of defense on behalf of\n(29), see e.g. Lewis 1971: 204ff, Jubien 1993: 118ff, and Varzi 2000:\n291ff. See also King's 2006 reply to Fine 2003 for a more general\ndiagnosis of the semantic mechanisms at issue here.) \nThere is a way of expressing the supplementation intuition that is\neven stronger than (P.5). It corresponds to the following thesis,\nwhich differs from (P.5) in the consequent: \nThis says that if y is not part of x, there exists\nsomething that comprises exactly those parts of y that are\ndisjoint from x—something we may call the\ndifference or relative complement between y\nand x. It is easily checked that this principle implies\n(P.5). On the other hand, the diagram in Figure 5 shows that the\nconverse does not hold: there are two parts of y in this\ndiagram that do not overlap x, namely z and\nw, but there is nothing that consists exactly of such parts,\nso we have a model of (P.5) in which (P.6) fails. \nAny misgivings about (P.5) may of course be raised against (P.6). But\nwhat if we agree with the above arguments in support of (P.5)? Do they\nalso give us reasons to accept the stronger principle (P.6)? The\nanswer is in the negative. Plausible as it may initially sound, (P.6)\nhas consequences that even an extensionalist may not be willing to\naccept. For example, it may be argued that although the base and the\nstem of this wine glass jointly compose a larger part of the glass\nitself, and similarly for the stem and the bowl, there is nothing\ncomposed just of the base and the bowl (= the difference between the\nglass and the stem), since these two pieces are standing apart. More\ngenerally, it appears that (P.6) would force one to accept the\nexistence of a wealth of “scattered” entities, such as the\naggregate consisting of your nose and your thumbs, or the aggregate of\nall mountains higher than Mont Blanc. And since V. Lowe (1953), many\nauthors have expressed discomfort with such entities\nregardless of extensionality. (One philosopher who explicitly\naccepts extensionality but feels uneasy about scattered entities is\nChisholm 1987.) As it turns out, the extra strength of (P.6) is\ntherefore best appreciated in terms of the sort of mereological\naggregates that this principle would force us to accept, aggregates\nthat are composed of two or more parts of a given whole. This suggests\nthat any additional misgivings about (P.6), besides its extensional\nimplications, are truly misgivings about matters of composition. We\nshall accordingly postpone their discussion to Section 4, where we\nshall attend to these matters more fully. For the moment, let us\nsimply say that (P.6) is, on the face of it, not a principle that can\nbe added to M without further argument. \nOne last important family of decomposition principles concerns the\nquestion of atomism. Mereologically, an atom (or “simple”)\nis an entity with no proper parts, regardless of whether it is\npoint-like or has spatial (and/or temporal) extension: \nBy definition of ‘PP’, all atoms are pairwise disjoint and\ncan only overlap things of which they are part. Are there any such\nentities? And, if there are, is everything entirely made up of atoms?\nIs everything comprised of at least some atoms? Or is everything made\nup of atomless “gunk”—as Lewis (1991: 20) calls\nit—that divides forever into smaller and smaller parts? These\nare deep and difficult questions, which have been the focus of\nphilosophical investigation since the early days of philosophy and\nthroughout the medieval and modern debate on anti-divisibilism, up to\nKant's antinomies in the Critique of Pure Reason (see the\nentries on\n ancient atomism\n and\n atomism from the 17th to the 20th century).\n Along with nuclear physics, they made their way into contemporary\nmereology mainly through Nicod's (1924) “geometry of the\nsensible world”, Tarski's (1929) “geometry of\nsolids”, and Whitehead's (1929) theory of “extensive\nconnection” mentioned in Section 3.1, and are now center stage\nin many mereological disputes at the intersection between metaphysics\nand the philosophy of space and time (see, for example, Sider 1993,\nForrest 1996a, Zimmerman 1996, Markosian 1998a, Schaffer 2003,\nMcDaniel 2006, Hudson 2007a, Arntzenius 2008, and J. Russell 2008, and\nthe papers collected in Hudson 2004; see also Sobociński 1971 and\nEberle 1967 for some early treatments of these questions in the spirit\nof Leśniewski's Mereology and of Leonard and Goodman's\nCalculus of Individuals, respectively). Here we shall confine\nourselves to a brief examination. \nThe two main options, to the effect that everything is ultimately made\nup of atoms, or that there are no atoms at all, are typically\nexpressed by the following postulates, respectively: \n(See e.g. Simons 1987: 42.) These postulates are mutually\nincompatible, but taken in isolation they can consistently be added to\nany standard mereological theory X considered here.\nAdding (P.7) yields a corresponding Atomistic version,\nAX; adding (P.8) yields an Atomless version,\nÃX. Since finitude together with the\nantisymmetry of parthood (P.3) jointly imply that mereological\ndecomposition must eventually come to an end, it is clear that any\nfinite model of M—and a fortiori of\nany extension of M—must be atomistic.\nAccordingly, an atomless mereology ÃX admits\nonly models of infinite cardinality. An example of such a model,\nestablishing the consistency of the atomless versions of most standard\nmereologies considered in this survey, is provided by the regular open\nsets of a Euclidean space, with ‘P’ interpreted as\nset-inclusion (Tarski 1935). On the other hand, the consistency of an\natomistic theory is typically guaranteed by the trivial one-element\nmodel (with ‘P’ interpreted as identity), though one can\nalso have models of atomistic theories that allow for infinite\ndomains. A case in point is provided by the closed intervals on the\nreal line, or the closed sets of a Euclidean space (Eberle 1970). In\nfact, it turns out that even when X is as strong as\nthe full calculus of individuals, corresponding to the theory\nGEM of Section 4.4, there is no purely\nmereological formula that says whether there are finitely or\ninfinitely many atoms, i.e., that is true in every finite model of\nAX but in no infinite model (Hodges and Lewis\n1968). \nConcerning Atomicity, it is also worth noting that (P.7) does not\nquite say that everything is ultimately made up of atoms; it\nmerely says that everything has atomic\n parts.[16]\n As such it rules out gunky worlds, but one may wonder whether it\nfully captures the atomistic intuition. In a way, the answer is in the\naffirmative. For, assuming Reflexivity and Transitivity, (P.7) is\nequivalent to the following \nwhich is logically equivalent to \n(adding a tautological conjunct), which is an instance of the general\nschema \nAnd (35) is the closest we can get to saying that x is\ncomposed of the φs, i.e., all and only those entities that satisfy\nthe given condition φ (in the present case: being an atomic part\nof x): every φ is part of x, and any part of\nx overlaps some φ. Indeed, provided the φs are\npairwise disjoint, this is the standard definition of what it means\nfor something x to be composed of the φs (van Inwagen\n1990: 29), and surely enough, if the φs are all atomic, then they\nare pairwise disjoint. Thus, although (P.7) does not say that\neverything is ultimately composed of atoms, it implies it—at\nleast in the presence of (P.1) and (P.2). (Of course, non-standard\nmereologies in which either postulates is rejected may not warrant the\ninitial equivalence, so in such theories (33) would perhaps be a\nbetter way to express the assumption of atomism.) In another way,\nhowever, (34) may still not be enough. For if the domain is infinite,\n(P.7) admits of models that seem to run afoul of the atomistic\ndoctrine. A simple example is a descending chain of decomposition that\nnever “bottoms out”, as in Figure 6: here x is\nultimately composed of atoms, but the pattern of decomposition that\ngoes down the right branch “looks” awfully similar to a\ngunky precipice. For a concrete example (from Eberle 1970: 75),\nconsider the set of all subsets of the natural numbers, with parthood\nmodeled by the subset relation. In such a universe, each singleton\n{n} will count as an atom and each infinite set {m:\nm > n} will be “made up” of atoms.\nYet the set of all such infinite sets will be infinitely descending.\nModels of this sort do not violate the idea that everything is\nultimately composed of atoms. However, they violate the idea that\neverything can be decomposed into its ultimate constituents.\nAnd this may be found problematic if atomism is meant to carry the\nweight of metaphysical grounding: as J. Schaffer puts it, the\natomist's ontology seems to drain away “down a bottomless\npit” (2007: 184); being is “infinitely deferred, never\nachieved” (2010: 62). Are there any ways available to the\natomist to avoid this charge? One option would simply be to require\nthat every model be finite, or that it involve only a finite set of\natoms. Yet such requirements, besides being philosophically harsh and\ncontroversial even among atomists, cannot be formally implemented in\nfirst-order mereology, the former for well-known model-theoretic\nreasons and the latter in view of the above-mentioned result by Hodges\nand Lewis (1968). The only reasonable option would seem to be a\ngenuine strengthening of Atomicity in the spirit of what Cotnoir\n(2013c) calls “superatomism”. Given any object x,\n(P.7) guarantees the existence of some parthood chain that\nbottoms out at an atom. Superatomicity would require that\nevery parthood chain of x bottoms out—a\nproperty that fails in the model of Figure 6. At the moment, such ways\nof strengthening (P.7) have not been explored. However, in view of the\nconnection between classical mereology and Boolean algebras (see\nbelow, Section 4.4), mathematical models for superatomistic\nmereologies may be recovered from the work on superatomic Boolean\nalgebras initiated by Mostowski and Tarski (1939) and eventually\nsystematized in Day (1960). (A Boolean algebra is superatomic if and\nonly if every subalgebra is atomic, as with the algebra generated by\nthe finite subsets of a given set; see Day 1967 for an overview.) See\nalso Shiver (2015) for ways of strengthening (P.7) in the context of\nstronger mereologies such as GEM (Section 4.4), or\nwithin theories formulated in languages enriched with set variables or\nplural quantification. \nAnother thing to notice is that, independently of their philosophical\nmotivations and formal limitations, atomistic mereologies admit of\nsignificant simplifications in the axioms. For instance,\nAEM can be simplified by replacing (P.5) and (P.7)\nwith \nwhich in turns implies the following atomistic variant of the\nextensionality thesis (27): \nThus, any atomistic extensional mereology is truly\n“hyperextensional” in Goodman's (1958) sense: things built\nup from exactly the same atoms are identical. In particular, if the\ndomain of an AEM-model has only finitely many atoms,\nthe domain itself is bound to be finite. An interesting question,\ndiscussed at some length in the late 1960's (Yoes 1967, Eberle 1968,\nSchuldenfrei 1969) and taken up more recently by Simons (1987: 44f)\nand Engel and Yoes (1996), is whether there are atomless analogues of\n(27′). Is there any predicate that can play the role of\n‘A’ in an atomless mereology? Such a predicate would\nidentify the “base” (in the topological sense) of the\nsystem and would therefore enable mereology to cash out Goodman's\nhyperextensional intuitions even in the absence of atoms. The question\nis therefore significant especially from a nominalistic perspective,\nbut it has deep ramifications also in other fields (e.g., in\nconnection with a Whiteheadian conception of space according to which\nspace itself contains no parts of lower dimensions such as points or\nboundary elements; see Forrest 1996a, Roeper 1997, and Cohn and Varzi\n2003). In special cases there is no difficulty in providing a positive\nanswer. For example, in the ÃEM model\nconsisting of the open regular subsets of the real line, the open\nintervals with rational end points form a base in the relevant sense.\nIt is unclear, however, whether a general answer can be given that\napplies to any sort of domain. If not, then the only option would\nappear to be an account where the notion of a “base” is\nrelativized to entities of a given sort. In Simons's terminology, we\ncould say that the ψ-ers form a base for the φ-ers if and only\nif the following variants of (P.5′) and (P.7) are satisfied: \nAn atomistic mereology would then correspond to the limit case where\n‘ψ’ is identified with the predicate ‘A’\nfor every choice of ‘φ’. In an atomless mereology, by\ncontrast, the choice of the base would depend each time on the level\nof “granularity” set by the relevant specification of\n‘φ’. \nConcerning atomless mereologies, one more remark is in order. For just\nas (P.7) is too weak to rule out unpleasant atomistic models, so too\nthe formulation of (P.8) may be found too weak to capture the intended\nidea of a gunky world. For one thing, as it stands (P.8) presupposes\nAntisymmetry. Absent (P.3), the symmetric two-element pattern in\nFigure 3, left, would qualify as atomless. To rule out such models\nindependently of (P.3), one should understand (P.8) in terms of the\nstronger notion of ‘PP’ given in (20′), i.e.,  \nLikewise, note that the pattern in Figure 2, middle, will qualify as a\nmodel of (P.8) unless Supplementation is assumed, though again such a\npattern does not quite correspond to what philosophers ordinarily have\nin mind when they talk about gunk. It is indeed an interesting\nquestion whether Supplementation (or perhaps Quasi-supplementation, as\nsuggested by Gilmore 2016) is in some sense presupposed by the\nordinary concept of gunk. To the extent that it is, however, then\nagain one may want to be explicit, in which case the relevant\naxiomatization may be simplified. For instance,\nÃMM can be simplified by merging (P.4) and\n(P.8) into a single axiom: \nThere is, in addition, another, more important sense in which (P.8)\nmay seem too week. After all, infinite divisibility is loose talk.\nGiven (P.8) (and also given (P.8′)), gunk may have denumerably\nmany, possibly continuum-many parts; but can it have more? Is there an\nupper bound on the cardinality on the number of pieces of gunk? Should\nit be allowed that for every cardinal number there may be\nmore than that many pieces of gunk? (P.8) is silent on these\nquestions. Yet these are certainly aspects of atomless mereology that\ndeserve scrutiny. It may even be thought that the world is not mere\ngunk but “hypergunk”, as Nolan (2004: 305) calls\nit—gunk such that, for any set of its parts, there is a set of\nstrictly greater cardinality containing only its parts. It is not\nknown whether such a theory is consistent (though Nolan conjectured\nthat a model can be constructed using the resources of standard set\ntheory with Choice and urelements together with some inaccessible\ncardinal axioms), and even if it were, some philosophers would\npresumably be inclined to regard hypergunk as a mere logical\npossibility (Hazen 2004). Nonetheless the question is indicative of\nthe sort of leeway that (P.8) leaves, and that one might want to\nregiment. \nSo much for the two main options, corresponding to atomicity and\natomlessness. What about theories that lie somewhere between these two\nextremes? Surely it may be held that there are atoms, though not\neverything need be made up of atoms; or it may be held that there is\natomless gunk, though not everything need be gunky. (The latter\nposition is defended e.g. by Zimmerman 1996.) Formally, these\npossibilities can be put again in terms of suitable restrictions on\n(P.7) and (P.8), by requiring that the relevant conditions hold\nexclusively of certain entities:  \nAnd the options in question would correspond to endorsing\n(P.7φ) or (P.8φ) for specific values of\n‘φ’. At present, no thorough formal investigation has\nbeen pursued in this spirit (though see Masolo and Vieu 1999 and\nHudson 2007b). Yet the issue is particularly pressing when it comes to\nthe mereology of the spatio-temporal world. For example, it is a\nplausible thought that while the question of atomism may be left open\nwith regard to the mereological structure of material objects (pending\nempirical findings from physics), one might be able to settle it\n(independently) with regard to the structure of space-time itself.\nThis would amount to endorsing a version of either\n(P.7φ) or (P.8φ) in which\n‘φ’ is understood as a condition that is satisfied\nexclusively by regions of space-time. Some may find it hard to\nconceive of a world in which an atomistic space-time is inhabited by\nentities that can be decomposed indefinitely (pace McDaniel\n2006), in which case accepting (P.7φ) for regions would\nentail the stronger principle (P.7). However, (P.8φ)\nwould be genuinely independent of (P.8) unless it is assumed that\nevery mereologically atomic entity should be spatially unextended, an\nassumption that is not part of definition (32) and that has been\nchallenged by van Inwagen (1981) and Lewis (1991: 32) (and extensively\ndiscussed in recent literature; see e.g. MacBride 1998, Markosian\n1998a, Scala 2002, J. Parsons 2004, Simons 2004, Tognazzini 2006,\nBraddon-Mitchell and Miller 2006, Hudson 2006a, McDaniel 2007, Sider\n2007, Spencer 2010). More generally, such issues depend on the broader\nquestion of whether the mereological structure of a thing should\nalways “mirror” or be in perfect “harmony”\nwith that of its spatial or spatio-temporal receptacle, a question\naddressed in J. Parsons (2007) and Varzi (2007: §3.3) and further\ndiscussed in Schaffer (2009), Uzquiano (2011) and Saucedo (2011). (For\nmore on this, see the entry\n location and mereology.) \nSimilar considerations apply to other decomposition principles that\nmay come to mind at this point. For example, one may consider a\nrequirement to the effect that ‘PP’ forms a dense\nordering, as already Whitehead (1919) had it: \nAs a general decomposition principle, (P.9) might be deemed too\nstrong, especially in an atomistic setting. (Whitehead's own theory\nassumes Atomlessness.) However, it is plausible to suppose that (P.9)\nshould hold at least with respect to the domain of spatio-temporal\nregions, regardless of whether these are construed as atomless gunk or\nas aggregates of spatio-temporal atoms. For more on this, see\nEschenbach and Heydrich (1995) and Varzi (2007: §3.2). \nFinally, it is worth noting that if one assumed the existence of a\n“null item” that is part of everything, corresponding to\nthe postulate \nthen such an entity would perforce be an atom. Accordingly, no\natomless mereology is compatible with this assumption. But it bears\nemphasis that (P.10) is at odds with a host of other theories as well.\nFor, given (P.10), the Antisymmetry axiom (P.3) will immediately\nentail that the atom in question is unique, while the Reflexivity\naxiom (P.1) will entail that it overlaps everything, hence that\neverything overlaps everything. This means that under such axioms the\nSupplementation principle (P.4) cannot be satisfied except in models\nwhose domain includes a single element. Indeed, this is also true of\nthe weaker Quasi-supplementation principle, (P.4d). It\nfollows, therefore, that the result of adding (P.10) to any theory at\nleast as strong as (P.1) + (P.3) + (P.4d), and a fortiori\nto MM and any extension thereof, will immediately\ncollapse to triviality in view of the following corollary: \n‘Triviality’ may strike one as the wrong word here. After\nall, there have been and continue to be philosophers who hold\nradically monistic ontologies—from the Eleatics (Rea 2001) to\nSpinoza (J. Bennett 1984) all the way to contemporary authors such as\nHorgan and Potrč (2000), whose comparative ontological parsimony\nresults in the thesis that the whole cosmos is but one huge extended\natom, an enormously complex but partless “blobject”. For\nall we know, it may even be that the best ontology for quantum\nmechanics, if not for Newtonian mechanics, consists in a lonely atom\nspeeding through configuration-space (Albert 1996). None of this is\ntrivial. However, none of this corresponds to fully endorsing (36),\neither. For such philosophical theories do not, strictly speaking,\nassert the existence of one single entity—which is what\n(36) says—but only the existence of a single material substance\nalong with entities of other kinds, such as properties or\nspatio-temporal regions. In other words, they only endorse a sortally\nrestricted version of (36). In its full generality, (36) is much\nstronger and harder to swallow, and most mereologists would rather\navoid it. The bottom line, therefore, is that theories endorsing\n(P.10) are likely to be highly non-standard, pace Carnap's\npersuasion that the null item would be a “natural and convenient\nchoice” for certain purposes (such as providing a referent for\nall defective descriptions; see 1947: 37). A few authors have indeed\ngone that way, beginning with Martin (1943, 1965), who rejects\nunrestricted Reflexivity and characterizes the null item as\n“that which is not part of itself”. Other notable\nexceptions include Bunt (1985) and Meixner (1997) and, more recently,\nHudson (2006) and Segal (2014), both of whom express sympathy for the\nnull individual at the cost of foregoing unrestricted\n(Quasi-)Supplementation. See also Priest (2014a and 2014b: §6.13)\nand Cotnoir and Weber (2014), who avoid (36) through a paraconsistent\nrecasting of the underlying logic. Still another option would be to\ntreat the null item as a mere algebraic “fiction” and to\namend the entire mereological machinery accordingly, carefully\ndistinguishing between trivial cases of parthood and overlap (those\nthat involve the infectious null item) and genuine, non-trivial\nones: \nThe basic M-axioms need not be affected by this\ndistinction. But stronger principles such as Supplementation could\ngive way to their “genuine” counterparts, as in \nand this would suffice to block the inference to (36) while keeping\nwith the spirit of standard mereology. This strategy is not uncommon,\nespecially in the mathematically oriented literature (see e.g. Mormann\n2000, Forrest 2002, Pontow and Schubert 2006), and we shall briefly\nreturn to it in Section 4.4 below. In general, however, mereologists\ntend to side with traditional wisdom and steer clear of (P.10)\naltogether. \nLet us now consider the second way of extending M\nmentioned at the beginning of Section 3. Just as we may want to\nregiment the behavior of P by means of decomposition principles that\ntake us from a whole to its parts, we may look at composition\nprinciples that go in the opposite direction—from the parts to\nthe whole. More generally, we may consider the idea that the domain of\nthe theory ought to be closed under mereological operations of various\nsorts: not only mereological sums, but also products, differences, and\nmore. \nConditions on composition are many. Beginning with the weakest, one\nmay consider a principle to the effect that any pair of suitably\nrelated entities must underlap, i.e., have an upper bound: \nExactly how ‘ξ’ should be construed is, of course, an\nimportant question by itself—a version of what van Inwagen\n(1987, 1990) calls the “Special Composition Question”. A\nnatural choice would be to identify ξ with mereological overlap,\nthe rationale being that such a relation establishes an important tie\nbetween what may count as two distinct parts of a larger whole. As we\nshall see (Section 4.5), with ξ so construed (P.11ξ)\nis indeed rather uncontroversial. By contrast, the most liberal choice\nwould be to identify ξ with the universal relation, in which case\n(P.11ξ) would reduce to its consequent and assert the\nexistence of an upper bound for any pair of entities\nx and y. An axiom of this sort was used, for\ninstance, in Whitehead's (1919, 1920) mereology of\n events.[17]\n In any case, and regardless of any specific choice, it is apparent\nthat (P.11ξ) does not express a strong condition on\ncomposition, as the consequent is trivially satisfied in any domain\nthat includes a universal entity of which everything is part, or any\nentity sufficiently large to include both x and y as\nparts regardless of how they are related. \nA stronger condition would be to require that any pair of suitably\nrelated entities must have a minimal\nunderlapper—something composed exactly of their parts and\nnothing else. This requirement is sometimes stated by saying that any\nsuitable pair must have a mereological “sum”, or\n “fusion”,[18]\n though it is not immediately obvious how this requirement should be\nformulated. Consider the following definitions: \n(‘Sizxy’ may be read:\n‘z is a sumi of x and\ny’. The first notion is found e.g. in Eberle 1967,\nBostock 1979, and van Benthem 1983; the second in Tarski 1935 and\nLewis 1991; the third in Needham 1981, Simons 1987, and Casati and\nVarzi 1999.) Then, for each i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, one could\nextend M by adding a corresponding axiom as follows,\nwhere again ξ specifies a suitable binary condition: \nIn a way, (P.12ξ,1) would seem the obvious choice,\ncorresponding to the idea that a sum of two objects is just a minimal\nupper bound of those objects relative to P (a partial ordering).\nHowever, this condition may be regarded as too weak to capture the\nintended notion of a mereological sum. For example, with ξ\nconstrued as overlap, (P.12ξ,1) is satisfied by the\nmodel of Figure 7, left: here z is a minimal upper bound of\nx and y, yet z hardly qualifies as a sum\n“made up” of x and y, since its parts\ninclude also a third, disjoint item w. Indeed, it is a simple\nfact about partial orderings that among finite models\n(P.12ξ,1) is equivalent to (P.11ξ), hence\njust as weak. \nBy contrast, (P.12ξ,2) corresponds to a notion of sum\nthat may seem too strong. In a way, it says—literally—that\nany pair of suitably ξ-related entities x and y\ncompose something, in the sense already discussed in connection with\n(35): they have an upper bound all parts of which overlap either\nx or y. Thus, it rules out the model on the left of\nFigure 7, precisely because w is disjoint from both\nx and y. However, it also rules out the model on the\nright, which depicts a situation in which z may be viewed as\nan entity truly made up of x and y insofar as it is\nultimately composed of atoms to be found either in x or in\ny. Of course, such a situation violates the Strong\nSupplementation principle (P.5), but that's precisely the sense in\nwhich (P.12ξ,2) may seem too strong: an\nanti-extensionalist might want to have a notion of sum that does not\npresuppose Strong Supplementation. \nThe formulation in (P.12ξ,3) is the natural compromise.\nInformally, it says that for any pair of suitably ξ-related\nentities x and y there is something that overlaps\nexactly those things that overlap either x or y.\nThis is strong enough to rule out the model on the left, but weak\nenough to be compatible with the model on the right. Note, however,\nthat if the Strong Supplementation axiom (P.5) holds, then\n(P.12ξ,3) is equivalent to (P.12ξ,2).\nMoreover, it turns out that if the stronger Complementation axiom\n(P.6) holds, then all of these principles are trivially satisfied in\nany domain in which there is a universal entity: in that case,\nregardless of ξ, the sum of any two entities is just the complement\nof the difference between the complement of one minus the other. (Such\nis the strength of (P.6), a genuine cross between decomposition and\ncomposition principles.) \nThe intuitive idea behind these principles is in fact best appreciated\nin the presence of (P.5), hence extensionality, for in that case the\nrelevant sums must be unique. Thus, consider the following definition,\nwhere i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and ‘℩’ is the\ndefinite descriptor): \nIn the context of EM, each\n(P.12ξ,i) would then imply that the\ncorresponding sum operator has all the “Boolean”\nproperties one might expect (Breitkopf 1978). For example, as long as\nthe arguments satisfy the relevant condition\n ξ,[20]\n each +i is idempotent, commutative, and\nassociative, \nand well-behaved with respect to parthood: \n(Note that (47) would warrant defining ‘P’ in terms of\n‘+i’, treated as a primitive. For\ni=3, this was actually the option endorsed in Leonard 1930:\n187ff.) \nIndeed, here there is room for further developments. For example, just\nas the principles in (P.12ξ,i) assert the\nexistence of a minimal underlapper for any pair of suitably related\nentities, one may at this point want to assert the existence of a\nmaximal overlapper, i.e., not a “sum” but a\n“product” of those entities. In the present context, such\nan additional claim can be expressed by the following principle: \nwhere  \nand ‘ξ’ is at least as strong as ‘O’\n(unless one assumes the Bottom principle (P.10)). In\nEM one could then introduce the corresponding binary\noperator, \nand it turns out that, again, such an operator would have the\nproperties one might expect. For example, as long as the arguments\nsatisfy the relevant condition ξ, × is idempotent,\ncommutative, and associative, and it interacts with each\n+i in conformity with the usual distribution\nlaws: \nNow, obviously (P.13ξ) does not qualify as a composition\nprinciple in the main sense that we have been considering here, i.e.,\nas a principle that yields a whole out of suitably ξ-related parts.\nStill, in a derivative sense it does. It asserts the existence of a\nwhole composed of parts that are shared by suitably related\nentities. Be that as it may, it should be noted that such an\nadditional principle is not innocuous unless ‘ξ’\nexpresses a condition stronger than mere overlap. For instance, we\nhave said that overlap may be a natural option if one is unwilling to\ncountenance arbitrary scattered sums. It would not, however, be enough\nto avoid embracing scattered products. Think of two C-shaped objects\noverlapping at both extremities; their sum would be a one-piece\nO-shaped object, but their product would consist of two disjoint,\nseparate parts (Bostock 1979: 125). Moreover, and independently, if\nξ were just overlap, then (P.13ξ) would be\nunacceptable for anyone unwilling to embrace mereological\nextensionality. For it turns out that the Strong Supplementation\nprinciple (P.5) would then be derivable from the weaker\nSupplementation principle (P.4) using only the partial ordering axioms\nfor ‘P’ (in fact, using only Reflexivity and Transitivity;\nsee Simons 1987: 30f). In other words, unless ‘ξ’\nexpresses a condition stronger than overlap, MM\ncum (P.13ξ) would automatically\ninclude EM. This is perhaps even more remarkable, for\non first thought the existence of products would seem to have nothing\nto do with matters of decomposition, let alone a\ndecomposition principle that is committed to extensionality. On second\nthought, however, mereological extensionality is really a\ndouble-barreled thesis: it says that two wholes cannot be decomposed\ninto the same proper parts but also, by the same token, that two\nwholes cannot be composed out of the same proper parts. So it is not\nentirely surprising that as long as proper parthood is well behaved,\nas per (P.4), extensionality might pop up like this in the presence of\nsubstantive composition principles. (It is, however, noteworthy that\nit already pops up as soon as (P.4) is combined with a seemingly\ninnocent thesis such as the existence of products, so the\nanti-extensionalist should keep that in mind.) \nOne can get even stronger composition principles by considering\ninfinitary bounds and sums. For example, (P.11ξ) can be\ngeneralized to a principle to the effect that any non-empty\nset of (two or more) entities satisfying a suitable condition\nψ has an upper bound. Strictly speaking, there is a difficulty in\nexpressing such a principle in a standard first-order language. Some\nearly theories, such as those of Tarski (1929) and Leonard and Goodman\n(1940), require explicit quantification over sets (see Niebergall\n2009a, 2009b; Goodman produced a set-free version of the calculus of\nindividuals in 1951). Others, such as Lewis's (1991), resort to the\nmachinery of plural quantification of Boolos (1984). One can, however,\navoid all this and achieve a sufficient degree of generality by\nrelying on an axiom schema where sets are identified by predicates or\nopen formulas. Since an ordinary first-order language has a\ndenumerable supply of open formulas, at most denumerably many sets (in\nany given domain) can be specified in this way. But for most purposes\nthis limitation is negligible, as normally we are only interested in\nthose sets of objects that we are able to specify. Thus, for most\npurposes the following axiom schema will do, where ‘φ’\nis any formula in the language and ‘ψ’ expresses the\ncondition in question: \n(The first conjunct in the antecedent is simply to guarantee that\n‘φ’ picks out a non-empty set, while in the\nconsequent the variable ‘z’ is assumed not to\noccur free in ‘ψ’.) The three binary sum axioms\ncorresponding to the schema in (P.12ξ,i) can be\nstrengthened in a similar fashion as follows: \nwhere \n(Here, ‘Sizφw’ may be\nread: ‘z is a sumi of every\nw such that φw’ and, again,\n‘z’ and ‘v’ are assumed not\nto occur free in φ; similar restrictions will apply below.) Thus,\neach (P.15ψ,i) says that if there are some\nφ-ers, and if every φ-er satisfies condition ψ, then the\nφ-ers have a sum of the relevant type. It can be checked that each\nvariant of (P.15ψ,i) includes the\ncorresponding finitely principle (P.12ψ,i) as\na special case, taking ‘φw’ to be the formula\n‘w=x ∨ w=y’ and\n‘ψw’ the condition\n‘(w=x → ξwy) ∧\n(w=y → ξxw)’. And, again, it\nturns out that in the presence of Strong Supplementation,\n(P.15ψ,2) and (P.15ψ,3) are equivalent.\n \nOne could also consider here a generalized version of the Product\nprinciple (P.13ξ), asserting the conditional existence\nof a maximal common overlapper—a common “nucleus”,\nin the terminology of Leonard and Goodman (1940)—for any\nnon-empty set of entities satisfying a suitable condition. Adapting\nfrom Goodman (1951: 37), such a principle could be stated as\nfollows: \nwhere \nand ‘ψw’ expresses a condition at least as\nstrong as ‘∀x(φx →\nOwx)’ (again, unless one assumes the Bottom principle\n(P.10)). This principle includes the finitary version\n(P.13ξ) as a special case, taking\n‘φw’ and ‘ψw’ as\nabove, so the remarks we made in connection with the latter apply\nhere. An additional remark, however, is in order. For there is a sense\nin which (P.16ψ) might be thought to be redundant in\nthe presence of the infinitary sum principles in\n(P.15ψ,i). Intuitively, a maximal common\noverlapper (i.e., a product) of a set of overlapping entities is\nsimply a minimal underlapper (a sum) of their common parts; that is\nprecisely the sense in which a product principle qualifies as a\ncomposition principle. Thus, intuitively, each of the infinitary sum\nprinciples above should have a substitution instance that yields\n(P.16ψ) as a theorem, at least when\n‘ψw’ is as strong as indicated. However, it\nturns out that this is not generally the case unless one assumes\nextensionality. In particular, it is easy to see that\n(P.15ψ,3) does not generally imply\n(P.16ψ), for it may not even imply the binary version\n(P.13ξ). This can be verified by taking\n‘ξxy’ and ‘ψw’ to\nexpress just the requirement of overlap, i.e., the conditions\n‘Oxy’ and\n‘∀x(φx → Owx)’,\nrespectively, and considering again the non-extensional model\ndiagrammed in Figure 4. In that model, x and y do\nnot have a product, since neither is part of the other and neither\nz nor w includes the other as a part. Thus,\n(P.13ξ) fails, which is to say that\n(P.16ψ) fails when ‘φ’ picks out the\nset {x, y}; yet (P.15ψ,3) holds, for both\nz and w are things that overlap exactly those things\nthat overlap some common part of the φ-ers, i.e., of x\nand y.  \nIn the literature, this fact has been neglected until recently (Pontow\n2004). It is, nonetheless, of major significance for a full\nunderstanding of (the limits of) non-extensional mereologies. As we\nshall see in the next section, it is also important when it comes to\nthe axiomatic structure of mereology, including the axiomatics of the\nmost classical theories. \nThe strongest versions of all these composition principles are\nobtained by asserting them as axiom schemas holding for every\ncondition ψ, i.e., effectively, by foregoing any reference to\nψ altogether. Formally this amounts in each case to dropping the\nsecond conjunct of the antecedent, i.e., to asserting the schema\nexpressed by the relevant consequent with the only proviso that there\nare some φ-ers. In particular, the following schema is the\nunrestricted version of (P.15ψ,i), to the\neffect that every specifiable non-empty set of entities has a\nsumi:  \nFor i=3, the extension of EM obtained by\nadding every instance of this schema has a distinguished pedigree and\nis known in the literature as General Extensional Mereology,\nor GEM. It corresponds to the classical systems of\nLeśniewski and of Leonard and Goodman, modulo the underlying\nlogic and choice of primitives. The same theory can be obtained by\nextending EM with (P.152) instead, for in\nthe presence of extensionality the two schemas are equivalent. Indeed,\nit turns out that the latter axiomatization is somewhat redundant:\ngiven just Transitivity and Supplementation, Unrestricted\nSum2 entails all the other axioms, i.e.,\nGEM is the same theory as (P.2) + (P.4) +\n(P.152). By contrast, extending EM with\n(P.151) would result in a weaker theory (Figure 8), though\none can still get the full strength of GEM with the\nhelp of additional axioms. For example, Hovda (2009) shows that the\nfollowing will do:  \n(in which case, again, Transitivity and Supplementation would suffice,\ni.e., GEM = (P.2) + (P.4) + (P.151) +\n(P.17)). For other ways of axiomatizatizing of GEM\nusing (P.151), see e.g. Link (1983) and Landman (1991)\n(and, again, Hovda 2009). See also Sharvy (1980, 1983), where the\nextension of M obtained by adding (P.151)\nis called a “quasi-mereology”.  \nGEM is a powerful theory, and it was meant to be so\nby its nominalistic forerunners, who were thinking of mereology as a\ngood alternative to set theory. It is also decidable (Tsai 2013a),\nwhereas for example, M, MM, and\nEM, and many extensions thereof turn out to be\nundecidable. (For a comprehensive picture of decidability in\nmereology, see also Tsai 2009, 2011, 2013b.) Just how powerful is\nGEM? To answer this question, let us focus on the\nclassical formulation based on (P.153) and consider the\nfollowing generalized sum operator: \nThen (P.153) and (P.5) can be simplified to a single axiom\nschema: \nand we can introduce the following definitions: \nNote that (55) and (56) yield the binary operators defined in\n(403) and (49) as special cases. Moreover, in\nGEM the General ψ-Product principle\n(P.16ψ) is also derivable as a theorem, with\n‘ψ’ as weak as the requirement of mutual overlap, and\nwe can introduce a corresponding functor as follows: \nThe full strength of the theory can then be appreciated by considering\nthat its models are closed under each of these functors, modulo the\nsatisfiability of the relevant conditions. To be explicit: the\ncondition ‘DzU’ is unsatisfiable, so U\ncannot have a complement. Likewise products are defined only for\noverlappers and differences only for pairs that leave a remainder.\nOtherwise, however, (55)–(60) yield perfectly well-behaved\nfunctors. Since such functors are the natural mereological analogues\nof the familiar set-theoretic operators, with ‘σ’ in\nplace of set abstraction, it follows that the parthood relation\naxiomatized by GEM has essentially the same\nproperties as the inclusion relation in standard set theory. More\nprecisely, it is isomorphic to the inclusion relation restricted to\nthe set of all non-empty subsets of a given set, which is to say a\ncomplete Boolean algebra with the zero element removed—a result\nthat can be traced back to Tarski (1935: n. 4) and first proved in\nGrzegorczyk (1955:\n §4).[22] \nThere are other equivalent formulations of GEM that\nare noteworthy. For instance, it is a theorem of every extensional\nmereology that parthood amounts to inclusion of overlappers: \nThis means that in an extensional mereology ‘O’ could be\nused as a primitive and ‘P’ defined accordingly, as in\nGoodman (1951), and it can be checked that the theory defined by\npostulating (61) together with the Unrestricted Sum principle\n(P.153) and the Antisymmetry axiom (P.3) is equivalent to\nGEM (Eberle 1967). Another elegant axiomatization of\nGEM, due to an earlier work of Tarski\n (1929),[23]\n is obtained by taking just the Transitivity axiom (P.2) together with\nthe Sum2-analogue of the Unique Unrestricted Sum axiom\n(P.18). By contrast, it bears emphasis that the result of adding\n(P.153) to MM is not equivalent\nto GEM, contrary to the “standard”\ncharacterization given by Simons (1987: 37) and inherited by much\nliterature that followed, including Casati and Varzi (1999) and the\nfirst edition of this\n entry.[24]\n This follows immediately from Pontow's (2004) counterexample\nmentioned at the end of Section 4.3, since the non-extensional model\nin Figure 4 satisfies (P.153), and was first noted in\nPietruszczak (2000, n. 12). More generally, in Section 4.2 we have\nmentioned that in the presence of the binary Product postulate\n(P.13ξ), with ξ construed as overlap, the Strong\nSupplementation axiom (P.5) follows from the weaker Supplementation\naxiom (P.4). However, the model shows that the postulate is not\nimplied by (P.153) any more than it is implied by its\nrestricted variants (P.15ψ,3). Apart from its relevance\nto the proper characterization of GEM, this result is\nworth stressing also philosophically, for it means that\n(P.153) is by itself too weak to generate a sum out of any\nspecifiable set of objects. In other words, fully unrestricted\ncomposition calls for extensionality, on pain of giving up\nboth supplementation principles. The anti-extensionalist\nshould therefore keep that in mind. (On the other hand, a friend of\nextensionality may welcome this result as an argument in favor of\nadopting (P.152) instead of (P.153), for we have\nalready noted that such a way of sanctioning unrestricted composition\nturns out to be enough, in MM, to entail Strong\nSupplementation along with the existence of all products and, with\nthem, of all sums; see Varzi 2009, with discussion in Rea 2010 and\nCotnoir 2016 . In this sense, the standard way of characterizing\ncomposition given in (35), on which (P.152) is based, is\nnot as neutral as it might seem. On this and related matters,\nindicating that the axiomatic path to “classical extensional\nmereology” is no straightforward business, see also Hovda 2009\nand Gruszczyński and Pietruszczak 2014.)  \nWould we get a full Boolean algebra by supplementing\nGEM with the Bottom axiom (P.10), i.e., by positing\nthe mereological equivalent of the empty set? One immediate way to\nanswer this question is in the affirmative, but only in a trivial\nsense: we have already seen in Section 3.4 that, under the axioms of\nMM, (P.10) only admits of degenerate one-element\nmodels. Such is the might of the null item. On the other hand, suppose\nwe rely on the “non-trivial” notions of genuine parthood\nand genuine overlap defined in (37)–(38). And suppose we\nintroduce a corresponding family of “non-trivial”\noperators for sum, product, etc. Then it can be shown that the theory\nobtained from GEM by adding (P.10) and replacing\n(P.5) and (P.153) with the following non-trivial\nvariants: \nis indeed a full Boolean algebra under the new operators (Pontow and\nSchubert 2006). This shows that, mathematically, mereology does indeed\nhave all the resources to stand as a robust and yet nominalistically\nacceptable alternative to set theory, the real source of difference\nbeing the attitude towards the nature of singletons (as already\nemphasized by Leśniewski 1916 and eventually clarified in Lewis\n1991). As already mentioned, however, from a philosophical perspective\nthe Bottom axiom is by no means a favorite option. The null item would\nhave to exist “nowhere and nowhen” (as Geach 1949: 522 put\nit), or perhaps “everywhere and everywhen” (as in Efird\nand Stoneham 2005), and that is hard to swallow. One may try to\njustify the gulp in various ways, perhaps by construing the null item\nas a non-existing individual (Bunge 1966), as a Meinongian object\nlacking all nuclear properties (Giraud 2013), as an Heideggerian\nnothing that nothings (Priest 2014a and 2014b: §6.13), or as the\nultimate incarnation of divine omnipresent simplicity (Hudson 2006b,\n2009). But few philosophers would be willing to go ahead and swallow\nfor the sole purpose of neatening up the algebra.  \nFinally, it is worth recalling that the assumption of atomism\ngenerally allows for significant simplifications in the axiomatics of\nmereology. For instance, we have already seen that\nAEM can be simplified by subsuming (P.5) and (P.7)\nunder a single Atomistic Supplementation principle, (P.5′).\nLikewise, it is easy to see that GEM is compatible\nwith the assumption of Atomicity (just consider the one-element\nmodel), and the resulting theory has some attractive features. In\nparticular, it turns out that AGEM can be simplified\nby replacing any of the Unrestricted Sum postulates in\n(P.15i) with the more perspicuous \nwhich asserts, for any non-empty set of entities, the existence of a\nsumi composed exactly of all the atoms that\ncompose those entities. Indeed, GEM also provides the\nresources to overcome the limits of the Atomicity axiom (P.7)\ndiscussed in Section 3.4. For, on the one hand, the infinitely\ndescending chain depicted in Figure 6 is not a model of\nAGEM, since it is missing all sorts of sums. On the\nother, in GEM one can actually strenghten (P.7) in\nsuch a way as to require explicitly that everything be made entirely\natoms, as in \n(See Shiver 2015.) It should be noted, however, that such advantages\ncome at a cost. For regardless of the number of atoms one begins with,\nthe axioms of AGEM impose a fixed relationship\nbetween that number, κ, and the overall number of things, which\nis going to be 2κ–1. As Simons (1987: 17)\npointed out, this means that the possible cardinality of an\nAGEM-model is restricted. There are models with 1, 3,\n7, 15, 2ℵ0, and many more cardinalities,\nbut no models with, say, cardinality 2, 4, 6, or\nℵ0. Obviously, this is not a consequence of\n(P.15i) alone but also of the other axioms of\nGEM (the unsupplemented pattern in Figure 2, left,\nsatisfies (P.15i) for each i and has 2\nelements, and can be expanded at will to get models of any finite\ncardinality, or indefinitely to get a model with ℵ0\nelements, as in Figure 2, center; see also Figure 8 for a supplemented\nnon-filtrated model of (P.151) with 4 elements and Figure\n7, right, for a supplemented non-extensional model of\n(P.153) with 6 elements). Still, it is a fact that in the\npresence of such axioms each (P.15i) rules out a\nlarge number of possibilities. In particular, every finite model of\nAGEM—hence of GEM—is\nbound to involve massive violations of what Comesaña (2008)\ncalls “primitive cardinality”, namely, the intuive thesis\nto the effect that, for any integer n, there could be exactly\nn things. And since the size of any atomistic domain can\nalways be reached from below by taking powers, it also follows that\nAGEM cannot have infinite models of strongly\ninaccessible cardinality. Such is, as Uzquiano (2006) calls it, the\n“price of universality” in the context of Atomicity. \nWhat about ÃGEM, the result of adding the\nAtomlessness axiom (P.8)? Obviously the above limitation does not\napply, and the Tarski model mentioned in Section 3.4 will suffice to\nestablish consistency. However, note that every GEM\nmodel—hence every ÃGEM model—is\nnecessarily bound at the top, owing to the existence of the universal\nentity U. This is not by itself problematic: while the\nexistence of U is the dual the Bottom axiom, a top jumbo of\nwhich everything is part has none of the formal and philosophical\noddities of a bottom atom that is part of everything (though see\nSection 4.5 for qualifications). Yet a philosopher who believes in\ninfinite divisibility, or at least in its possibility, might feel the\nsame about infinite composability. Just as everything could be made of\natomless gunk that divides forever into smaller and smaller parts,\neverything might be mereological “junk”—as Schaffer\n(2010: 64) calls it—that composes forever into greater and\ngreater wholes. (One philosopher who held such a view is, again,\nWhitehead, whose mereology of events includes both the Atomlessness\nprinciple and its upward dual, i.e.: \nSee Whitehead 1919: 101; 1920: 76). GEM is compatible\nwith the former possibility, and ÃGEM makes it\ninto a universal necessity. But neither has room for the latter.\nIndeed, the possibility of junk might be attractive also from an\natomist perspective. After all, already Theophilus thought that even\nthough everything is composed of monads, “there is never an\ninfinite whole in the world, though there are always wholes greater\nthan others ad infinitum” (Leibniz, New\nEssays, I-xiii-21). Is this a serious limitation of\nGEM? More generally, is this a serious limitation of\nany theory in which the existence of U is a\ntheorem—effectively, any theory endorsing at least the\nunrestricted version of (P.14ψ)? (In the absence of\nAntisymmetry, one may want to consider this question by understanding\nthe predicate ‘PP’ in (P.19) in terms of the stronger\ndefinition given in (20′); see above, ad (P.8′).)\nSome authors have argued that it is (Bohn 2009a, 2009b, 2010), given\nthat junk is at least conceivable (see also Tallant 2013) and admits\nof plausible cosmological and mathematical models (Morganti 2009,\nMormann 2014). Others have argued that it isn't, because junk is\nmetaphysically impossible (Schaffer 2010, Watson 2010). Others still\nare openly dismissive about the question (Simons 1987: 83). One may\nalso take the issue to be symptomatic of the sorts of trouble that\naffect any theory that involves quantification over absolutely\neverything, as the Unrestricted Sum principles in\n(P.15i) obviously do (see Spencer 2012, though his\nremarks focus on mereological theories formulated in terms of plural\nquantification). One way or the other, from a formal perspective the\nincompatibility with Ascent may be viewed as an unpleasant consequence\nof (P.15i), and a reason to go for weaker\ntheories. In particular, it may be viewed as a reason to endorse only\nfinitary sums, which is to say only instances of\n(P.12ξ,i), or perhaps its unrestricted\nversion: \n(See Contessa 2012 and Bohn 2012: 216 for explicit suggestions in this\nspirit.) This would be consistent with the existence of junky worlds\nas it is consistent with the existence of gunky worlds. Yet it should\nbe noted that even this move has its costs. For example, it turns out\nthat in a world that is both gunky and junky (what Bohn calls\n“hunk”) (P.12i) is in tension with the\nComplementation principle (P.6) for each i (Cotnoir 2014).\nMoreover, while (P.12i) is compatible with junky\nworlds, i.e., models that fully satisfy the Ascent axiom\n(P.19), it is in tension with the possibility of worlds containing\njunky structures along with other, disjoint elements (Giberman 2015).\n \nThe algebraic strength of GEM, and of its weaker\nfinitary and infinitary variants, is worth emphasizing, but it also\nreflects substantive mereological postulates whose philosophical\nunderpinnings leave room for considerable controversy well beyond the\ngunk/junk dispute. Indeed, all composition principles turn\nout to be controversial, just as the decomposition principles examined\nin Section 3. For, on the one hand, it appears that the weaker,\nrestricted formulations, from (P.11ξ) to\n(P.15ψ,i), are just not doing enough work: not\nonly do they depend on the specification of the relevant limiting\nconditions, as expressed by the predicates ‘ξ’ and\n‘ψ’; they also treat such conditions as merely\nsufficient for the existence of bounds and sums, whereas ideally we\nare interested in an account of conditions that are both sufficient\nand necessary. On the other hand, the stronger, unrestricted\nformulations appear to go too far, for while they rule out the\npossibility of junky worlds, they also commit the theory to the\nexistence of a large variety of prima facie implausible,\nunheard-of mereological composites—a large variety of\n“junk” in the good old sense of the word. \nConcerning the first sort of worry, one could of course construe every\nrestricted composition principle as a biconditional expressing both a\nsufficient and a necessary condition for the existence of an\nupper bound, or a sum, of a given pair or set of entities. But then\nthe question of how such conditions should be construed becomes\ncrucial, on pain of turning a weak sufficient condition into an\nexceedingly strong requirement. For example, with regard to\n(P.11ξ) we have mentioned the idea of construing\n‘ξ’ as ‘O’, the rationale being that\nmereological overlap establishes an important connection between what\nmay count as two distinct parts of a larger (integral) whole. However,\nas a necessary condition overlap is obviously too stringent. The top\nhalf of my body and the bottom half do not overlap, yet they do form\nan integral whole. The topological relation of contact, i.e., overlap\nor abut, might be a better candidate. Yet even that would be\ntoo stringent. We may have misgivings about the existence of scattered\nentities consisting of totally disconnected parts, such as my umbrella\nand your left shoe or, worse, the head of this trout and the body of\nthat turkey (Lewis 1991: 7–8). Yet in other cases it appears\nperfectly natural to countenance wholes that are composed of two or\nmore disconnected entities: a bikini, a token of the lowercase letter\n‘i’, my copy of The Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n(R. Cartwright 1975; Chisholm 1987)—indeed any garden-variety\nmaterial object, insofar as it turns out to be a swarm of spatially\nisolated elementary particles (van Inwagen 1990). Similarly for some\nevents, such as Dante's writing of Inferno versus the sum of\nSebastian's stroll in Bologna and Caesar's crossing of Rubicon (see\nThomson 1977: 53f). More generally, intuition and common sense suggest\nthat some mereological composites exist, not all; yet the\nquestion of which composites exist seems to be up for grabs.\nConsider a series of almost identical mereological aggregates that\nbegins with a case where composition appears to obtain (e.g., the sum\nof all body cells that currently make up my body, the relative\ndistance among any two neighboring ones being less than 1 nanometer)\nand ends in a case where composition would seem not to obtain (e.g.,\nthe sum of all body cells that currently make up my body, after their\nrelative distance has been increased to 1 kilometer). Where should we\ndraw the line? In other words—and to limit ourselves to\n(P.15ψ,i)—what value of n would\nmark a change of truth-value in the soritical sequence generated by\nthe schema \nwhen ‘φ’ picks out my body cells and\n‘ψ’ expresses the condition ‘less than\nn+1 nanometers apart from another φ-er’? It may\nwell be that whenever some entities compose a bigger one, it is just a\nbrute fact that they do so (Markosian 1998b), perhaps a matter of\ncontingent fact (Nolan 2005: 36, Cameron 2007). But if we are unhappy\nwith brute facts, if we are looking for a principled way of drawing\nthe line so as to specify the circumstances under which the facts\nobtain, then the question is truly challenging. That is, it is a\nchallenging question short of treating it as a mere verbal dispute, if\nnot denying that it makes any sense to raise it in the first place\n(see Hirsch 2005 and Putnam 1987: 16ff, respectively; see also Dorr\n2005 and McGrath 2008 for relevant discussion). This is, effectively,\nvan Inwagen's “Special Composition Question” mentioned in\nSection 4.1, an early formulation of which may be found in Hestevold\n(1981). For the most part, the literature that followed has focused on\nthe conditions of composition for material objects, as in Sanford\n(1993), Horgan (1993), Hoffman and Rosenkrantz (1997), Merricks\n(2001), Hawley (2006), Markosian (2008), Vander Laan (2010), and Silva\n(2013). Occasionally the question has been discussed in relation to\nthe ontology of actions, as in Chant (2006). In its most general form,\nhowever, the Special Composition Question may be asked with respect to\nany domain of entities whatsoever. \nConcerning the second worry, to the effect that the\nunrestricted sum principles in (P.15i)\nwould go too far, its earliest formulations are almost as old as the\nprinciples themselves (see e.g. V. Lowe 1953 and Rescher 1955 on the\ncalculus of individuals, with replies in Goodman 1956, 1958). Here one\npopular line of response, inspired by Quine (1981: 10), is simply to\ninsist that the pattern in (P.15i) is the only\nplausible option, disturbing as this might sound. Granted, common\nsense and intuition dictate that some and only some mereological\ncomposites exist, but we have just seen that it is hard to draw a\nprincipled line. On pain of accepting brute facts, it would appear\nthat any attempt to do away with queer sums by restricting composition\nwould have to do away with too much else besides the queer entities;\nfor queerness comes in degrees whereas parthood and existence cannot\nbe a matter of degree (though we shall return to this issue in Section\n5). As Lewis (1986b: 213) puts it, no restriction on composition can\nbe vague, but unless it is vague, it cannot fit the intuitive\ndesiderata. Thus, no restriction on composition could serve\nthe intuitions that motivate it; any restriction would be arbitrary,\nhence gratuitous. And if that is the case, then either mereological\ncomposition never obtains or else the only non-arbitrary, non-brutal\nanswer to the question, Under what conditions does a set have a\nsumi?, would be the radical one afforded by\n(P.15i): Under any condition whatsoever. (This\nline of reasoning is further elaborated in Lewis 1991: 79ff as well as\nin Heller 1990: 49f, Jubien 1993: 83ff; Sider 2001: 121ff, Hudson\n2001: 99ff, and Van Cleve 2008: §3; for reservations and critical\ndiscussion, see Merricks 2005, D. Smith 2006, Nolan 2006, Korman 2008,\n2010, Wake 2011, Carmichael 2011, and Effingham 2009, 2011a, 2011c.)\nBesides, it might be observed that any complaints about the\ncounterintuitiveness of unrestricted composition rest on psychological\nbiases that should have no bearing on the question of how the world is\nactually structured. Granted, we may feel uneasy about treating\nshoe-umbrellas and trout-turkeys as bona fide entities, but\nthat is no ground for doing away with them altogether. We may ignore\nsuch entities when we tally up the things we care about in ordinary\ncontexts, but that is not to say they do not exist. Even if\none came up “with a formula that jibed with all ordinary\njudgments about what counts as a unit and what does not” (Van\nCleve 1986: 145), what would that show? The psychological factors that\nguide our judgments of unity simply do not have the sort of\nontological significance that should be guiding our construction of a\ngood mereological theory, short of thinking that composition itself is\nmerely a secondary quality (as in Kriegel 2008). In the words of\nThomson (1998: 167): reality is like “an over-crowded\nattic”, with some interesting contents and a lot of junk, in the\nordinary sense of the term. We can ignore the junk and leave it to\ngather dust; but it is there and it won't go away. (One residual\nproblem, that such observations do not quite address, concerns the\nstatus of cross-categorial sums. Absent any restriction, a\npluralist ontology might involve trout-turkeys and shoe-umbrellas\nalong with trout-promenades, shoe-virtues, color-numbers, and what\nnot. It is certainly possible to conceive of some such\nthings, as in the theory of structured propositions mentioned in\nSection 2.1, or in certain neo-Aristotelian metaphysics that construe\nobjects as mereological sums of a “material” and a\n“formal” part; see e.g. Fine 1999, 2010, Koslicki 2007,\n2008, and Toner 2012. There are also theories that allow for composite\nobjects consisting of both “positive” and\n“negative” parts, e.g., a donut, as in Hoffman and\nRichards 1985. At the limit, however, the universal entity U\nwould involve parts of all ontological kinds. And there would\nseem to be nothing arbitrary, let alone any psychological biases, in\nthe thought that at least such monsters should be banned. For\na statement of this view, see Simons 2003, 2006; for a reply, see\nVarzi 2006b.) \nA third worry, which applies to all (restricted or unrestricted)\ncomposition principles, is this. Mereology is supposed to be\nontologically “neutral”. But it is a fact that the models\nof a theory cum composition principles tend to be more\ndensely populated than those of the corresponding composition-free\ntheories. If the ontological commitment of a theory is measured in\nQuinean terms—via the dictum “to be is to be a\nvalue of a bound variable” (1939: 708)—it follows that\nsuch theories involve greater ontological commitments than their\ncomposition-free counterparts. This is particularly worrying in the\nabsence of the Strong Supplementation postulate (P.5)—hence the\nextensionality principle (27)—for then the ontological\nexuberance of such theories may yield massive multiplication. But the\nworry is a general one: composition, whether restricted or\nunrestricted, is not an ontologically “innocent”\noperation. \nThere are two lines of response to this worry (whose earliest\nformulations go as far back as V. Lowe 1953). First, it could be\nobserved that the ontological exuberance associated with the relevant\ncomposition principles is not substantive—that the increase of\nentities in the domain of a mereological theory cum\ncomposition principles involves no substantive additional commitments\nbesides those already involved in the underlying theory\nwithout composition. This is obvious in the case of modest\nprinciples in the spirit of (P.11ξ) and\n(P.14ψ), to the effect that all suitably related\nentities must have an upper bound. After all, there are small things\nand there are large things, and to say that we can always find a large\nthing encompassing any given small things of the right sort is not to\nsay much. But the same could be said with respect to those stronger\nprinciples that require the large thing to be composed\nexactly of the small things—to be their mereological\nsum in some sense or other. At least, this seems reasonable in the\npresence of extensionality. For in that case it can be argued that\neven a sum is, in an important sense, nothing over and above\nits constituent parts. The sum is just the parts “taken\ntogether” (Baxter 1998a: 193); it is the parts “counted\nloosely” (Baxter 1988b: 580); it is, effectively, “the\nsame portion of Reality” (Lewis 1991: 81), which is strictly a\nmultitude and loosely a single thing. That's why, if you proceed with\na six-pack of beer to the six-items-or-fewer checkout line at the\ngrocery store, the cashier is not supposed to protest your use of the\nline on the ground that you have seven items: either s/he'll count the\nsix bottles, or s/he'll count the one pack. This thesis, known in the\nliterature as “composition as identity”, is by no means\nuncontroversial and admits of different formulations (see van Inwagen\n1994, Yi 1999, Merricks 1999, McDaniel 2008, Berto and Carrara 2009,\nCarrara and Martino 2011, Cameron 2012, Wallace 2013, Cotnoir 2013a,\nHawley 2013, and the essays in Baxter and Cotnoir 2014). To the extent\nthat the thesis is accepted, however, the charge of ontological\nexuberance loses its force. The additional entities postulated by the\nsum axioms would not be a genuine addition to being; they would be, in\nArmstrong's phrase, an “ontological free lunch” (1997:\n13). In fact, if composition is in some sense a form of identity, then\nthe charge of ontological extravagance discussed in connection with\nunrestricted composition loses its force, too. For if a sum is nothing\nover and above its constituent proper parts, whatever they are, and if\nthe latter are all right, then there is nothing extravagant in\ncountenancing the former: it just is them, whatever they are. (This is\nnot to say that unrestricted composition is entailed by the\nthesis that composition is identity; indeed, see McDaniel 2010 for an\nargument to the effect that it isn't.) \nSecondly, it could be observed that the objection in question bites at\nthe wrong level. If, given some entities, positing their sum were to\ncount as further ontological commitment, then, given a mereologically\ncomposite entity, positing its proper parts should also count as\nfurther commitment. After all, every entity is distinct from its\nproper parts. But then the worry has nothing to do with the\ncomposition axioms; it is, rather, a question of whether there is any\npoint in countenancing a whole along with its proper parts or\nvice versa (see Varzi 2000, 2014 and Smid 2015). And if the answer is\nin the negative, then there seems to be little use for mereology\ntout court. From the point of view of the present worry, it\nwould appear that the only thoroughly parsimonious account would be\none that rejects any mereological complex whatsoever.\nPhilosophically such an account is defensible (Rosen and Dorr 2002;\nGrupp 2006; Liggins 2008; Cameron 2010; Sider 2013; Contessa 2014) and\nthe corresponding axiom, \nis certainly compatible with M (up to\nEM and more). But the immediate corollary \nsays it all: nothing would be part of anything else and parthood would\ncollapse to identity. (This account is sometimes referred to as\nmereological nihilism, in contrast to the mereological\nuniversalism expressed by (P.15i); see\nvan Inwagen 1990:\n 72ff.[25]\n Van Inwagen himself endorses a restricted version of nihilism, which\nleaves room for composite living things. So does Merricks 2000, 2001,\nwhose restricted nihilism leaves room for composite conscious\nthings.) \nIn recent years, further worries have been raised concerning\nmereological theories with substantive composition\nprinciples—especially concerning the full strength of\nGEM. Among other things, it has been argued that the\nprinciple of unrestricted composition does not sit well with certain\nfundamental intuitions about persistence through time (van Inwagen\n1990, 75ff), that it is incompatible with certain plausible theories\nof space (Forrest 1996b), or that it leads to paradoxes similar to the\nones afflicting naïve set theory (Bigelow 1996). A detailed\nexamination of such arguments is beyond the scope of this entry. For\nsome discussion of the first issue, however, see Rea (1998), McGrath\n(1998, 2001), Hudson (2001: 93ff) and Eklund (2002: §7). On the\nsecond, see Oppy (1997) and Mormann (1999). Hudson (2001: 95ff) also\ncontains some discussion of the last point. \nWe conclude with some remarks on a question that was briefly mentioned\nabove in connection with the Special Composition Question but that\npertains more generally to the underlying notion of parthood that\nmereology seeks to systematize. All the theories examined so far, from\nM to GEM and its variants, appear to\nassume that parthood is a perfectly determinate relation: given any\ntwo entities x and y, there is always an objective,\ndeterminate fact of the matter as to whether or not x is part\nof y. However, in some cases this seems problematic. Perhaps\nthere is no room for indeterminacy in the idealized mereology of space\nand time as such; but when it comes to the mereology of ordinary\nspatio-temporal particulars (for instance) the picture looks\ndifferent. Think of objects such as clouds, forests, heaps of sand.\nWhat exactly are their constitutive parts? What are the mereological\nboundaries of a desert, a river, a mountain? Some stuff is positively\npart of Mount Everest and some stuff is positively not part of it, but\nthere is borderline stuff whose mereological relationship to Everest\nseems indeterminate. Even living organisms may, on closer look, give\nrise to indeterminacy issues. Surely Tibbles's body comprises his tail\nand surely it does not comprise Pluto's. But what about the whisker\nthat is coming loose? It used to be a firm part of Tibbles and soon it\nwill drop off for good, yet meanwhile its mereological relation to the\ncat is dubious. And what goes for material bodies goes for everything.\nWhat are the mereological boundaries of a neighborhood, a college, a\nsocial organization? What about the boundaries of events such as\npromenades, concerts, wars? What about the extensions of such ordinary\nconcepts as baldness, wisdom, personhood?  \nThese worries are of no little import, and it might be thought that\nsome of the principles discussed above would have to be revisited\naccordingly—not because of their ontological import but because\nof their classical, bivalent presuppositions. For example, the\nextensionality theorem of EM, (27), says that\ncomposite things with the same proper parts are identical, but in the\npresence of indeterminacy this may call for qualifications. The model\nin Figure 9, left, depicts x and y as non-identical\nby virtue of their having distinct determinate parts; yet one might\nprefer to describe a situation of this sort as one in which the\nidentity between x and y is itself indeterminate,\nowing to the partly indeterminate status of the two outer atoms.\nConversely, in the model on the right x and y have\nthe same determinate proper parts, yet again one might prefer to\nsuspend judgment concerning their identity, owing to the indeterminate\nstatus of the middle atom.  \nNow, it is clear that a lot here depends on how exactly one\nunderstands the relevant notion of indeterminacy. There are, in fact,\ntwo ways of understanding a claim of the form \ndepending on whether the phrase ‘it is indeterminate\nwhether’ is assigned wide scope, as in (64a), or narrow scope,\nas in (64b): \nOn the first understanding, the indeterminacy is merely de\ndicto: perhaps ‘a’ or\n‘b’ are vague terms, or perhaps\n‘part’ is a vague predicate, but there is no reason to\nsuppose that such vagueness is due to objective deficiencies in the\nunderlying reality. If so, then there is no reason to think that it\nshould affect the apparatus of mereology either, at least insofar as\nthe theory is meant to capture some structural features of the world\nregardless of how we talk about it. For example, the statement \nmay owe its indeterminacy to the semantic indeterminacy of\n‘Tibbles’: our linguistic practices do not, on closer\nlook, specify exactly which portion of reality is currently picked out\nby that name. In particular, they do not specify whether the name\npicks out something whose current parts include the whisker that is\ncoming loose and, as a consequence, the truth conditions of (65) are\nnot fully determined. But this is not to say that the stuff out there\nis mereologically indeterminate. Each one of a large variety of\nslightly distinct chunks of reality has an equal claim to being the\nreferent of the vaguely introduced name ‘Tibbles’, and\neach such thing has a perfectly precise mereological structure: some\nof them currently include the lose whisker among their parts, others\ndo not. (Proponents of this view, which also affords a way of dealing\nwith the so-called “problem of the many” of Unger 1980 and\nGeach 1980, include Hughes 1986, Heller 1990, Lewis 1993a, McGee 1997,\nand Varzi 2001.) Alternatively, one could hold that the indeterminacy\nof (65) is due, not to the semantic indeterminacy of\n‘Tibbles’, but to that of ‘part’ (as in\nDonnelly 2014): there is no one parthood relation; rather, several\nslightly different relations are equally eligible as extension of the\nparthood predicate, and while some such relations connect the loose\nwisker to Tibbles, others do not. In this sense, the dashed lines in\nFigure 9 would be “defects” in the models, not in the\nreality that they are meant to represent. Either way, it is apparent\nthat, on a de dicto understanding, mereological indeterminacy\nneed not be due to the way the world is (or isn't): it may just be an\ninstance of a more general and widespread phenomenon of indeterminacy\nthat affects our language and our conceptual apparatus at large. As\nsuch, it can be accounted for in terms of whatever\ntheory—semantic, pragmatic, or even epistemic—one finds\nbest suited for dealing with the phenomenon in its generality. (See\nthe entry on\n vagueness.)\n The principles of mereology, understood as a theory of the parthood\nrelation, or of all the relations that qualify as admissible\ninterpretations of the parthood predicate, would hold\n regardless.[26] \nBy contrast, on the second way of understanding claims of the form\n(64), corresponding to (64b), the relevant indeterminacy is genuinely\nde re: there is no objective fact of the matter as to whether\na is part of b, regardless of the words we use to\ndescribe the situation. For example, on this view (65) would be\nindeterminate, not because of the vagueness of ‘Tibbles’,\nbut because of the vagueness of Tibbles itself: there simply would be\nno fact of the matter as to whether the whisker that is coming loose\nis part of the cat. Similarly, the dashed lines in Figure 9 would not\nreflect a “defect” in the models but a genuine, objective\ndeficiency in the mereological organization of the underlying reality.\nAs it turns out, this is not a popular view: already Russell (1923)\nargued that the very idea of worldly indeterminacy betrays a\n“fallacy of verbalism”, and some have gone as far as\nsaying that de re indeterminacy is simply not\n“intelligible” (Dummett 1975: 314; Lewis 1986b: 212) or\nruled out a priori (Jackson 2001: 657). Nonetheless, several\nphilosophers feel otherwise and the idea that the world may include\nvague entities relative to which the parthood relation is not fully\ndetermined has received considerable attention in recent literature,\nfrom Johnsen (1989), Tye (1990), and van Inwagen (1990: ch. 17) to\nMorreau (2002), McKinnon (2003), Akiba (2004), N. Smith (2005), Hyde\n(2008: §5.3), Carmichael (2011), and Sattig (2013, 2014),\ninter alia. Even those who do not find that thought\nattractive might wonder whether an a priori ban on it might\nbe unwarranted—a deep-seated metaphysical prejudice, as Burgess\n(1990: 263) puts it. (Dummett himself withdrew his earlier remark and\nspoke of a “prejudice” in his 1981: 440.) It is therefore\nworth asking: How would such a thought impact on the mereological\ntheses considered in the preceding sections?  \nThere is, unfortunately, no straightforward way of answering this\nquestion. Broadly speaking, two main sorts of answer may be\nconsidered, depending on whether (i) one simply takes the\nindeterminacy of the parthood relation to be the reason why\ncertain statements involving the parthood predicate lack a definite\ntruth-value, or (ii) one understands the indeterminacy so that\nparthood becomes a genuine matter of degree. Both options,\nhowever, may be articulated in a variety of ways.  \nOn option (i) (initially favored by such authors as Johnsen and Tye),\nit could once again be argued that no modification of the basic\nmereological machinery is strictly necessary, as long as each\npostulate is taken to characterize the parthood relation insofar as it\nbehaves in a determinate fashion. Thus, on this approach, (P.1) should\nbe understood as asserting that everything is definitely part of\nitself, (P.2) that any definite part of any definite part of a thing\nis itself a definite part of that thing, (P.3) that things that are\ndefinitely part of each other are identical, and so on, and the truth\nof such principles is not affected by the consideration that parthood\nneed not be fully determinate. There is, however, some leeway\nas to how such basic postulates could be integrated with further\nprinciples concerning explicitly the indeterminate cases. For example,\ndo objects with indeterminate parts have indeterminate identity?\nFollowing Evans (1978), many philosophers have taken the answer to be\nobviously in the affirmative. Others, such as Cook (1986), Sainsbury\n(1989), or Tye (2000), hold the opposite view: vague objects are\nmereologically elusive, but they have the same precise identity\nconditions as any other object. Still others maintain that the answer\ndepends on the strength of the underlying mereology. For instance, T.\nParsons (2000: §5.6.1) argues that on a theory such as\nEM cum unrestricted binary\n sums,[27]\n the de re indeterminacy of (65) would be inherited by \nA related question is: Does countenancing objects with indeterminate\nparts entail that composition be vague, i.e., that there is sometimes\nno matter of fact whether some things make up a whole? A popular view,\nmuch influenced by Lewis (1986b: 212), says that it does. Others, such\nas Morreau (2002: 338), argue instead that the link between vague\nparthood and vague composition is unwarranted: perhaps the de\nre indeterminacy of (65) is inherited by some instances of \n(for example, x could be something that is just like Tibbles\nexcept that the whisker is determinately not part of it); yet this\nwould not amount to saying that composition is vague, for the\nfollowing might nonetheless be true: \nFinally, there is of course the general question of how one should\nhandle logically complex statements concerning, at least in part,\nmereologically indeterminate objects. A natural choice is to rely on a\nthree-valued semantics of some sort, the third value being, strictly\nspeaking, not a truth value but rather a truth-value gap. In this\nspirit, both Johnsen and Tye endorse the truth-tables of Kleene (1938)\nwhile Hyde those of Łukasiewicz (1920). However, it is worth\nstressing that other choices are available, including\nnon-truth-functional accounts. For example, Akiba (2000) and Morreau\n(2002) recommend a form of “supervaluationism”. This was\noriginally put forward by Fine (1975) as a theory for dealing with\nde dicto indeterminacy, the idea being that a statement\ninvolving vague expressions should count as true (false) if and only\nit is true (false) on every “precisification” of those\nexpressions. Still, a friend of de re indeterminacy may\nexploit the same idea by speaking instead of precisifications of the\nunderlying reality—what Sainsbury (1989) calls\n“approximants”, Cohn and Gotts (1996)\n“crispings”, and T. Parsons (2000)\n“resolutions” of vague objects. As a result, one would be\nable to explain why, for example, (69) appears to be true and (70)\nfalse (assuming that Tibbles's head is definitely part of Tibbles),\nwhereas both conditionals would be equally indeterminate on Kleene's\nsemantics and equally true on Łukasiewicz's: \nAs for option (ii)—to the effect that de re\nmereological indeterminacy is a matter of degree—the picture is\ndifferent. Here the main motivation is that whether or not something\nis part of something else is really not an all-or-nothing affair. If\nTibbles has two whiskers that are coming loose, then we may want to\nsay that neither is a definite part of Tibbles. But if one whisker is\nlooser than the other, then it would seem plausible to say that the\nfirst is part of Tibbles to a lesser degree than the second,\nand one may want the postulates of mereology to be sensitive to such\ndistinctions. This is, for example, van Inwagen's (1990) view of the\nmatter, which results in a fuzzification of parthood that parallels in\nmany ways to the fuzzification of membership in Zadeh's (1965) set\ntheory, and it is this sort of intuition that also led to the\ndevelopment of such formal theories as Polkowsky and Skowron's (1994)\n“rough mereology” or N. Smith's (2005) theory of\n“concrete parts”. Again, there is room for some leeway\nconcerning matters of detail, but in this case the main features of\nthe approach are fairly clear and uniform across the literature. For\nlet π be the characteristic function associated with the parthood\nrelation denoted by the basic mereological primitive, ‘P’.\nThen, if classically this function is bivalent, which can be expressed\nby saying that π(x, y) always takes, say, the\nvalue 1 or the value 0 according to whether or not x is part\nof y, to say that parthood may be indeterminate is to say\nthat π need not be fully bivalent. And whereas option (i) simply\ntakes this to mean that π may sometimes be undefined, option (ii)\ncan be characterized by saying that the range of π may include\nvalues intermediate between 0 and 1, i.e., effectively, values from\nthe closed real interval [0, 1]. In other words, on this latter\napproach π is still a perfectly standard, total function, and the\nonly serious question that needs to be addressed is the genuinely\nmereological question of what conditions should be assumed to\ncharacterize its behavior—a question not different from the one\nthat we have considered for the bivalent case throughout the preceding\nsections.  \nThis is not to say that the question is an easy one. As it turns out,\nthe “fuzzification” of the core theory M\nis rather straightforward, but its extensions give rise to various\nissues. Thus, consider the partial ordering axioms (P.1)–(P.3).\nClassically, these correspond to the following conditions on π\n: \nand one could argue that the very same conditions may be taken to fix\nthe basic properties of parthood regardless of whether π is\nbivalent. Perhaps one may consider weakening (P.2π) as\nfollows (Polkowsky and Skowron 1994): \nOr one may consider strengthening (P.3π) as follows (N.\nSmith\n 2005):[28] \nBut that is about it: there is little room for further adjustments.\nThings immediately get complicated, though, as soon as we move beyond\nM. Take, for instance, the Supplementation principle\n(P.4) of MM. One natural way of expressing it in\nterms of π is as follows: \nThere are, however, fifteen other ways of expressing (P.4) in terms of\nπ, obtained by re-writing one or both occurrences of ‘=\n1’ as ‘> 0’ and one or both occurrences of\n‘= 0’ as ‘< 1’. In the presence of\nbivalence, these would all be equivalent ways of saying the same\nthing. However, such alternative formulations would not coincide if\nπ is allowed to take non-integral values, and the question of which\nversion(s) best reflect the supplementation intuition would have to be\ncarefully examined. (See e.g. the discussion in N. Smith 2005: 397.)\nAnd this is just the beginning: it is clear that similar issues arise\nwith most other principles discussed in the previous sections, such as\nComplementation, Density, or the various composition principles. (See\ne.g. Polkowsky and Skowron 1994: 86 for a formulation of the\nUnrestricted Sum axiom (P.152).) \nOn the other hand, it is worth noting that precisely because the\ndifficulty is mainly technical—the framework itself being fairly\nfirm—now some of the questions raised in connection with option\n(i) tend to be less open to controversy. For example, the question of\nwhether mereological indeterminacy implies vague identity is generally\nanswered in the negative, especially if one adheres to the spirit of\nextensionality. For then it is natural to say that non-atomic objects\nare identical if and only if they have exactly the same parts to the\nsame degree—and that is not a vague matter (a point already made\nin Williamson 1994: 255). In other words, given that classically the\nextensionality principle (27) corresponds to the following\ncondition: \nit seems perfectly natural to stick to this condition even if the\nrange of π is extended from {0, 1} to [0, 1]. Likewise, the\nquestion of whether mereological indeterminacy implies vague\ncomposition or vague existence is generally answered in the\naffirmative (though not always; see e.g. Donnelly 2009 and Barnes and\nWilliams 2009). Van Inwagen (1990: 228) takes this to be a rather\nobvious consequence of the approach, but N. Smith (2005: 399ff) goes\nfurther and provides a detailed analysis of how one can calculate the\ndegree to which a given non-empty set of things has a sum, i.e., the\ndegree of existence of the sum. (Roughly, the idea is to begin with\nthe sum as it would exist if every element of the set were a definite\npart of it, and then calculate the actual degree of existence of the\nsum as a function of the degree to which each element of the set is\nactually part of it).  \nThe one question that remains widely open is how all of this should be\nreflected in the semantics of our language, specifically the semantics\nof logically complex statements. As a matter of fact, there is a\ntendency to regard this question as part and parcel of the more\ngeneral problem of choosing the appropriate semantics for fuzzy logic,\nwhich typically amounts to an infinitary generalization of some\ntruth-functional three-valued semantics. The range of possibilities,\nhowever, is broader, and even here there is room for\nnon-truth-functional approaches—including degree-theoretic\nvariants of supervaluationism (as recommended e.g. in Sanford 1993:\n225).
