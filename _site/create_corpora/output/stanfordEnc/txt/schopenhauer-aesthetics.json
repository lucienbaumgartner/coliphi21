The theory is found predominantly in Book 3 of\nthe World as Will and Representation (WWR I) and in the\nelaboratory essays concerning Book 3 in the second volume (WWR II), and\nit is on these texts that I will concentrate here. This entry\noffers a brief background on Schopenhauer’s metaphysics before\naddressing Schopenhauer’s methodology in aesthetics, his account\nof the subjective and objective sides of aesthetic experience (both of\nthe beautiful and the sublime), his hierarchy of the arts and rationale\nfor this hierarchy, his view of artistic genius, the exceptional status\nof music among the fine arts, and the relationships he theorized\nbetween aesthetics and ethics.\n\n\n\nBy the 1870s, Arthur Schopenhauer’s philosophy had gained, in\nNietzsche’s words “ascendency in Europe” (GM\nIII, §5). Indeed, late-19th and\nearly-20th century philosophers, writers, composers and\nartists such as Nietzsche, Wagner, Brahms, Freud, Wittgenstein,\nHorkheimer, Hardy, Mann, Rilke, Proust, Tolstoy, Borges, Mahler, Langer\nand Schönberg were influenced by Schopenhauer’s\nthought.   Recognition came late in his life, however,\nstarting only in 1853 with the publication of a review article by J.\nOxenford.  Until then, Schopenhauer labored in relative obscurity,\ndespite the publication of numerous works such as: On the Fourfold\nRoot of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (his doctoral\ndissertation published in 1813, revised 1847), On Vision and\nColors (1816), his magnum opus The World as Will and\nRepresentation (1818/9; second, revised edition with a second\nvolume of essays 1844), On the Will in Nature (1836), On\nthe Freedom of the Will (which won a prize from the Royal\nNorwegian Society of Sciences in 1839), On the Basis of Morals\n(which did not win the prize from the Danish Royal Society of\nSciences despite its being the only entry for the competition), and two\nvolumes of Parerga and Paralipomena (1851). \n\nWhat many luminaries of European culture found gripping in\nSchopenhauer’s thought was his doctrine of the world as having\ntwo aspects related to each other as two sides of the same coin: (1) an\nultimate foundation as “will”—a blind, purposeless urge or\nstriving akin to energy—which he identified with the Kantian thing in\nitself (for competing interpretations of the argument for this\nidentification see: Atwell  1995; Janaway 1989, 1999a; Young,\n1987; DeCian & Segala 2002; Cartwright 2001; Jacquette 2007;\nShapshay 2008; and Wicks 2008); and (2) a world of\nrepresentation, i.e., the will qua thing in itself as it\n“objectifies” itself and appears to human beings through\ntheir shared mode of cognitive conditioning. \n\nSchopenhauer held that the character of the will qua thing in\nitself—blind urge—expresses itself in the perpetual strivings\nof living creatures and in the forces of inorganic matter. \nGrounding his proto-Darwinian philosophy of nature in his metaphysics\nand the empirical sciences of his day, Schopenhauer viewed nature as an\narena where living beings compete to survive and procreate, where\nspecies adapt to environmental conditions, and, most emphasized by\nSchopenhauer, where sentient beings suffer  as virtual\nslaves to their will to life [Wille zum\nLeben].  \n\nSchopenhauer’s metaphysics and philosophy of nature led him to\nthe doctrine of pessimism:  the view that sentient beings, with\nfew exceptions, are bound to strive and suffer greatly, all without any\nultimate purpose or justification and thus life is not really worth\nliving. This is a view that has seldom been defended in the history of\nWestern thought and became a potent philosophical problem for\nNietzsche and atheist existentialists.  \n\nMitigating his pessimism somewhat, Schopenhauer does see a salutary\nrole for the intellect in human life.  He identifies three main\nways in which the intellect breaks free to some degree from the\nservitude to the will and its attendant egoism: (1) in aesthetic\nexperience and artistic production, (2) in compassionate attitudes and\nactions, and (3) in ascetic resignation from embodied existence. \nIn each of these three ways of being in the world, a subject exercises\nvarying degrees of freedom from the will to life, a freedom which is\ninextricably bound up with a degree of “intuitive\nknowledge” of the world, or, as Wittgenstein would later put it,\nof “seeing the world aright.” Thus, the mode of being of\nthe aesthetic perceiver, the artist, the compassionate agent, and the\nascetic saint each has moral value in virtue of their possessing a\ndegree of true understanding of the world, which enables the attainment\nof a degree of freedom from ordinary egoism, and which leads them to\nnot add to—or possibly to diminish—the amount of suffering in the\nworld. \n\nAs with his philosophy as a whole, Schopenhauer takes his point of\ndeparture in aesthetics from Kant, praising him for deepening the\nsubjective turn in philosophical aesthetics and thereby putting it on\nthe right path (WWR I, Appendix, 560–61. Note: page references\nto vol. I refer to the Cambridge edition translation; references to\nvol. II to the Payne transl.).  Like Kant, he held that the phenomenon\nof beauty would only be illuminated through a careful scrutiny of its\neffects on the subject, rather than by proceeding in the pre-Kantian\nobjectivist fashion, searching out the properties of\nobjects—such as smoothness, delicacy and smallness—which\nputatively give rise to the feeling of the beautiful. But the\nsubjective turn is as far as Kant’s aesthetic-methodological\nmerit extends, according to Schopenhauer: it is too indirect, due to\nKant’s primary method in philosophy, the transcendental\nargument. \n\nApplied to the phenomenon of beauty in the Critique of the Power\nof Judgment, Kant starts from an analysis of the judgments that\nthe subject makes about the objects of experience, e.g., “this\nrose is beautiful.” After offering an analysis of the logic of\nsuch aesthetic judgments—that they are based on feeling, more\nparticularly on a feeling of disinterested pleasure, but that they also\nclaim universal subjective validity—Kant then searches for the\na priori conditions for the possibility of making judgments\nthat have this logical form.  \n\nBy contrast, Schopenhauer does not believe that the aesthetician\nshould start from the aesthetic judgment, but rather from\nimmediate aesthetic experience, before the subject attempts\nto formulate judgments about that experience (WWR I,\n530–531). The advocacy of this focus, rather than Kant’s\nfocus on judgments, has to do with the ways in which Schopenhauer\ndeparts from Kant’s epistemology. Very briefly, the key issue\nhas to do with the status of non-conceptual knowledge. As Kant\nfamously held, “[t]houghts without content are empty, intuitions\nwithout concepts are blind”\n(A50–51/B74–75). Schopenhauer adheres to the first clause,\nbut holds that there is indeed what today philosophers might call\n“non-conceptual content,” and what he referred to\nvariously as “intuitive cognition” [intuitive\nErkenntniß], “knowledge of perception” [anschauliche\nErkenntniß] or “feeling” [das Gefühl]. This\ncognition allows us—and many non-human animals—to navigate\nand operate in the world to a great extent without\nconcepts. Furthermore, for Schopenhauer, this is the kind of knowledge\nwe gain, par excellence, through aesthetic experiences of\nnature and art; but this knowledge is not or at least not-yet\nconceptual, though it is a knowledge of the “Platonic\nIdeas” or essential features of the phenomenal world (more on\nthe Ideas at section 3.2). \n\nIn order to preserve for ourselves or to communicate\n“intuitive knowledge” to others, we may try to\nshow it or say it. If one is an artist, one might\nshow such knowledge by attempting to embody it in a work of art. But\nfor non-artists, trying to ‘say’ this knowledge means\nattempting to capture it propositionally, and in so doing, for\nSchopenhauer, we translate intuitive into conceptual knowledge\nby a process of abstraction. Unfortunately, something is inevitably lost in the\ntranslation. Thus, Schopenhauer concludes, Kant’s starting\npoint—the aesthetic judgment—is already at one remove from true\naesthetic experience. And since this remove is not innocuous, insofar\nas the judgment does not faithfully transmit the richness of the\nexperience, the aesthetic judgment constitutes the wrong focus for\naesthetic theorizing. \n\nFundamentally, however, the gap between aesthetic experience and\naesthetic judgments yields an essential difficulty for aesthetic\ntheories since these are necessarily formulated\npropositionally, and therefore cannot entirely capture the richness of\nimmediate, first-personal aesthetic experience. To his credit,\nSchopenhauer is quite frank about the methodological limits of\naesthetic theorizing, especially in the case of music (WWR I, section\n52; see also Goehr 1998; and\n section 5.2.5 below). Nonetheless, he ventures\nforth to offer just such a theory\nin the hopes that through it he may convince the reader of the\n“importance and high value of art (which are seldom sufficiently\nrecognized)” (WWR I, 294) and to help the reader enter a\npsychological space where she herself can gain the deep insights\nafforded by nature and the fine arts. \n\nAesthetic experience comes in two main varieties for Schopenhauer,\nthe beautiful and the sublime, and can be had through perception of\nboth nature and art. Although 18th century aesthetics\nalso included the “picturesque,” this drops out as a\nseparate category in both Kant and Schopenhauer’s aesthetic\ntheories. \n\nNearly all human beings, he holds, are capable of aesthetic\nexperience, otherwise they would be “absolutely insensitive to\nbeauty and sublimity—in fact these words would be meaningless for\nthem” (WWR I, 218).  Notwithstanding this nearly universally\nshared capacity for aesthetic experience, Schopenhauer remarks that it\nis enjoyed only occasionally by the majority of people and is enjoyed\nin a very sustained manner and to a high degree only by the genius.\nThere are two jointly necessary and sufficient conditions for any\nproperly aesthetic experience, one subjective and one objective. \n\nOrdinary cognition, according to Schopenhauer, is bound up with the\nindividual’s will, that is to say, with one’s generally\negoistic strivings, and is subordinate to the four forms of the\n“principle of sufficient reason” (PSR), the principle which\nholds that nothing is without a reason for why it is (FR, §5). The\nPSR is Schopenhauer’s formulation of the ways in which human\nbeings cognitively condition the world of representation. It includes\nspace, time and causality, as well as psychological, logical and\nmathematical forms of explanation.  \n\nBy contrast, aesthetic experience consists in the subject’s\nachieving will-less [willenlos] perception of the\nworld. In order for the subject to attain such perception, her\nintellect must cease viewing things in the ordinary\nway—relationally and ultimately in relation to one’s\nwill—she must “stop considering the Where, When, Why and\nWherefore of things but simply and exclusively consider the\nWhat” (WWR I, 201).  In other words, will-less\nperception is perception of objects simply for the understanding of\nwhat they are essentially, in and for themselves, and without regard to\nthe actual or possible relationships those phenomenal objects have to\nthe striving self.  \n\nSchopenhauer characterizes the subject who has aesthetic experience as\nthe “pure subject of cognition.” It is “pure”\nin the sense that the subject’s intellect is not operating in\nthe service of the will to life during aesthetic experience, though\nthis subject is still embodied—for without embodiment,\nwithout the senses, a subject would not perceive at all (WWR I,\n198). Thus, while the pure subject of cognition is free temporarily\nfrom the service of the individual will, it is nonetheless still\nidentical with the embodied subject of willing. The freedom of the\nintellect from the service to the individual will constitutes a sort\nof acting ‘out of character’. Exactly how the intellect\ncan cease to serve the individual will remains murky, however. (More on\nthis at 4.5; for a detailed account of role\nof freedom in Schopenhauer’s aesthetic theory, see Neill and\nShapshay 2012.) \n\nSimilar to the notion of disinterested pleasure in Kant, in\nSchopenhauer’s aesthetics the subjective side of aesthetic\nexperience involves the will-less pleasure of tranquility. The\nexperience of aesthetic tranquility stands in stark contrast with\nordinary willing. All willing, according to Schopenhauer, involves\nsuffering, insofar as it originates from need and\ndeficiency.   Satisfaction, when it is achieved affords a\nfleeting joy and yields fairly quickly to painful boredom, which is\ntantamount to a deficiency, and which starts the entire process anew.\n Given this grim account of willing, it is not surprising that\nSchopenhauer describes aesthetic experience in truly rapturous terms as\n“the painless state that Epicurus prized as the highest good and\nthe state of the gods,” and as “the Sabbath of the penal\nservitude of willing” when the “wheel of Ixion stands\nstill” (WWR I, 220). \n\nThe objective side of aesthetic experience is necessarily correlated\nand occurs simultaneously with aesthetic will-lessness: It is the\nperception of what Schopenhauer terms the “Platonic\nIdeas.”  The will qua thing in itself, on\nSchopenhauer’s metaphysics, objectifies itself at particular\ngrades; the Ideas correspond to these grades of objectification. The\nIdea in each particular thing is that which is enduring and essential\nin it (WWR I, 206) and can only be intuited in aesthetic experience of\nnature and art (WWR I, 182). \n\nThe ontological status and the coherence of the Ideas within\nSchopenhauer’s metaphysics has been a bone of contention for\ncommentators (see Hamlyn 1980, Chapter 6; Young 1987, 2005;\nAtwell 1995). The problem is this: On Schopenhauer’s account\nthere are only two aspects of the world, first, the world as will (the\nthing in itself or “will”); and, second, the world as\nrepresentation.  The Ideas, however, fit neatly into\nneither aspect. On the one hand, the Ideas seem to\nbelong to the world as will: In virtue of their being the\n“immediate and therefore adequate objecthood of the thing in\nitself” (WWR I, 197) the Ideas are independent of the cognitive\nconditions of time, space and causality (WWR I, 204). Yet, unlike the\nwill qua thing in itself, the Ideas may be directly perceived\nby a subject, and thus are more akin to representations.  In\ncontrast to ordinary representations, however, the Ideas revealed in\nthe phenomenal object have not yet entered into the particularlizing\nforms of the PSR (most notably, space, time and causality), they are\nrather universals. \n\nA further difficulty for the tenability of the Ideas in\nSchopenhauer’s system is the fact that he often refers to Ideas\nin the plural. For Schopenhauer, space and time are the\nprincipium individuationis; but since the Ideas are\nindependent of space and time, it is not clear how they can be\nindividuated at all. One option for understanding the place of the\nIdeas in his system would be to see them as playing the role of an\nepistemic rather than metaphysical bridge between the one will and the\nmany phenomena. This helps to explain their individuated status\nas follows: In a suggestive metaphor, Schopenhauer likens the Ideas to\n“steps on the ladder of the objectivation of that one will, of\nthe true thing in itself” (WWR I, 198); if one understands the\n“ladder”—the ensemble of Ideas—as part of the\nworld as representation, then each Idea—each “step” on the\nladder—is a universal perceived in various particular\nspatiotemporal objects. The Ideas then are the essential features of\nobjects or states of affairs that human beings may perceive when their\nattention is focussed squarely on the ‘what’ rather than on\nthe ‘why’ or ‘wherefore’ of phenomena. It\nshould be noted, however, that the Ideas are not abstracted by the\nsubject as are concepts on Schopenhauer’s view, but are, rather,\nperceived directly in them.  In sum, the Ideas seem to\nmake the most sense within his system as “abstract\nobjects”—objects that are not spatiotemporal, which do not\nstand in causal relationship with anything, and which have not been\nabstracted like a concept, but rather, are the real, objective, essential aspects\nof the world as representation as perceived by a will-less subject (WWR\nI, 234, 236). The crucial role that they play in\nSchopenhauer’s system is that they are the objects of all\naesthetic experience—both of the artist and spectator—and their\nperception constitutes insight into the essential nature of the\nphenomenal world. \n\nWhen the subject’s transition to the tranquil, will-less state\nof aesthetic contemplation occurs easily, that is, when the objects\n“meet that state halfway,” becoming “representatives\nof their Ideas by virtue of their intricate and at the same time clear\nand determinate form” (WWR I, 225), then the subject experiences\nthe beautiful. Natural objects, especially flora, accommodate\nthemselves most easily to the experience of the beautiful.   \n\nHowever, objects can be resistant to aesthetic contemplation in two\nmain ways: either they may be stimulating to the bodily appetites or\nthey may be hostile in some way to the human will to life. \n\nThe first category of contemplation-resistant objects, Schopenhauer\nterms, “the stimulating” or the “charming”.\nThese may be positively or negatively stimulating. On the positive\nside, he gives as examples, “prepared and table-ready dishes,\noysters, herring, lobster, bread and butter, beer, wine, etc.”\n(WWR I, 232). Since he holds that these necessarily stir\nthe appetite, they inevitably resist aesthetic contemplation and are\ntherefore unsuitable to be presented in works of art such as still-life\npaintings. \n\nAlong the same lines, a calculatedly-arousing treatment of\nnudes—what we might today put on a spectrum of pornography—for\nSchopenhauer, prevents aesthetic contemplation because it inevitably\nexcites lust and thus runs counter to the proper goals of art.\n Schopenhauer may have room in his aesthetic theory for erotic\nart, but this is not a topic which he explicitly addresses. \n\nOn the negatively stimulating side fall objects which are\ndisgusting. For reasons parallel to those offered with respect to the\npositively stimulating, disgusting objects should also be banished from\nart, because they necessarily arouse intense negative willing or\n“repugnance”. Ugliness, however, is not identical to the\ndisgusting, need not lead to repugnance and has, for Schopenhauer, a\nlegitimate place in art. Curiously, it seems that for both the\npositively and negatively stimulating Schopenhauer does not believe\nthat we may intellectually detach ourselves from our attraction, lust\nor repugnance in order to contemplate these aesthetically. But\nthe grounds on which he holds this view remain somewhat obscure (for\nmore on this topic see Neill 2015). \n\nThe other class of contemplation-resistant “objects” or\nphenomena are those that bear a hostile relationship to the\nhuman will insofar as they are so vast or powerful that they threaten\nto overwhelm the human individual or reduce his existence on this\nplanet to a mere speck.  Schopenhauer gives as examples desert\nlandscapes, cascades, and the starry night sky, among many others.\nUnlike the case of the stimulating, however, Schopenhauer does believe\nthat aesthetic contemplation of these phenomena is possible, and when\nit transpires the experience is that of the sublime. \n\n Following Kant’s distinction, Schopenhauer identifies\ntwo varieties of the sublime, the dynamical and the mathematical. They\nare distinguished by the nature of the threat posed to human willing in\ngeneral: if physical, then, for Schopenhauer, it is a case of the\ndynamical sublime; if psychological, then it is a case of the\nmathematical sublime. Although the sublime may be experienced with\nworks of art—notably with tragedy—most of Schopenhauer’s\nexamples come from nature and include a variety of landscapes and\nnatural phenomena ranging from a frozen winter landscape which affords\nvery little warmth and light to a violent storm at sea. He arrays them\nin terms of degrees of the sublime feeling they are likely to afford.\nThe higher the magnitude of the threat posed, the higher the degree of\nsublime feeling. \n\nSchopenhauer offers a phenomenologically-complex account of how we\nmay take aesthetic pleasure in such fearsome or overwhelming scenes. In\norder to contemplate the Ideas in hostile objects aesthetically, the\nsubject must first acknowledge the fearsomeness or the sheer vastness\nof the object, but then “consciously turn away” from the\nthreat, “violently wrenching himself free from his will”\n(WWR I, 226). If the subject can do this, and achieves will-less\ncontemplation of the Ideas which express themselves in these\nthreatening things, then the subject experiences a “state of\nelevation”—this is the feeling of the sublime.  \n\nAlthough Schopenhauer is not terribly explicit on the\nphenomenological differences between the beautiful and the sublime, two\nemerge from his account:  (1) the beautiful is characterized by a\nloss of self-consciousness whereas the sublime is\ncharacterized by two moments of self-consciousness; (2) the\nbeautiful is wholly pleasurable, but the sublime is mixed with\npain.  \n\nWhile Schopenhauer refers to a kind of self-consciousness that\nremains in the experience of the beautiful, the fact\nthat (1) one is somehow freeing one’s intellect from\nthe service of the will, and (2) one’s perception is no longer in the\nservice of the individual’s will are not themselves present to\nmind in his account of the beautiful.  However, in experience of\nthe sublime, these two additional elements of\nself-consciousness—consciousness of liberating oneself and\nconsciousness of having been liberated from the will and its\ncares—are present, and these instances of second-order\nconsciousness are accompanied by the feeling of\n“exaltation” [Erhebung] above the will\n[über den Willen] (WWR I, 233). The pleasure of\nexaltation is thus tied to the felt recognition of the subject’s power\nto detach from the pressures of his or her individual will, and is\nresonant of the Kantian account of the sublime, with its felt\nrecognition of one’s rational-moral vocation and freedom (for a fuller\naccount of this interpretation see Shapshay 2012; for competing\naccounts of the Schopenhauerian sublime see Neill, 2003 & 2011;\nVandenabeele 2003 & 2015; Janaway 1996; Young 1987; Wicks 2008;\nVasalou 2013). \n\nThe sublime plays a significant role in Schopenhauer’s theory\nof tragedy and his solution to the ‘rationality problem’ of\ntragedy, namely, how can we rationally take pleasure in witnessing\nterrible scenes and feeling the painful emotions of fear and pity that\nare integral to an experience of tragic drama? In addition to the high\ncognitive value of this genre, Schopenhauer regards the pleasure of\ntragedy as the highest degree of the feeling of the dynamically sublime\n(WWR II: 433). These two facets of Schopenhauer’s account of\ntragedy help explain the rationality of engaging with tragic drama as\nwell as the often-noted ethical significance of the genre (see \nsection 5.2.4 for more on tragedy).   \n\nPleasure in aesthetic experience comes from three main sources in\nSchopenhauer’s aesthetic theory. First, there is the tranquility\nof will-lessness (this is the predominant pleasure of the beautiful);\nsecond, is the pleasure of self-conscious exaltation over the will to\nlife, a pleasure akin to Kantian pride or respect for one’s\nrational-moral vocation (though Schopenhauer repudiates Kant’s\nview of pure practical reason); and a third kind of pleasure derives\nfrom the perception of Ideas, but is distinct from tranquility. \n\nSchopenhauer holds that the pleasure will come sometimes more from\nthe subjective and other times more from the objective side of\naesthetic experience. When the Ideas perceived objectify lower\ngrades of the will qua thing in itself, the pleasure will\nderive more from the experience of will-less tranquility, as the Ideas\nare not too significant. However, when the Ideas objectify higher\ngrades of the will—meaning more complex and complete\nobjectifications of the will—then the pleasure will derive more\nfrom the cognitive significance of these Ideas. The hierarchy in\nthe gradations of the will’s objectification has far-reaching\nimplications for Schopenhauer’s philosophy of art and for the\nhierarchy he posits among art forms and genres. \n\nA thorny interpretive issue arises from Schopenhauer’s account\nof aesthetic experience thus far, namely, how is it even possible in\nhis system (see Hamlyn 1980, Neymeyr 1995, and Neill 2008)?  The\nproblem is that aesthetic experience seems to require the breaking\nfree of the intellect from its service to the will to life. But\naccording to Schopenhauer, the intellect comes into being originally\nas a tool for and, as a rule, serves the needs of the will to life. He\nholds further that nature does nothing in vain. So it would seem that\nthe intellect\ncannot actually break from the will, but if this is so, then\naesthetic experience would not be possible. Ultimately, this issue is\nbound up with the possibility of human freedom more generally in\nSchopenhauer’s thought.  \n\nIn his prize-winning essay “On the Freedom of the Will,”\nSchopenhauer follows Kant in espousing a kind of compatibilism.\nNature is deterministic but the possibility of freedom is\nguaranteed by the “in itself” of the world which is\nindependent of the PSR and is in that way undetermined (see Shapshay,\n2011 for an account of Schopenhauer’s fuller argument for this\nclaim). In all of his works after the 1813 dissertation, however,\nSchopenhauer parts ways with Kant’s view of “causality\nthrough freedom” through a noumenal self.  The possibility of\naesthetic freedom is nonetheless vouchsafed by the\ntranscendental-idealist doctrine of the distinction between the\nempirical and intelligible character. By virtue of the\n‘two-sidedness’ of the individual’s character, the\nindividual can have transcendental/moral freedom, for Schopenhauer\nviews the intelligible character as the act of the free\nwill qua thing in itself [Willensakt]  \nwhose appearance,\nwhen developed and drawn out in time, space and all of the forms of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, is the empirical\ncharacter…. (WWR I, section 55, 316)  Exactly how the intellect may detach from the interests of the\nindividual will—the empirical character— by virtue of the\nintelligible character is difficult, perhaps impossible, to say,\nthough Schopenhauer is clear that the operation of transcendental\nfreedom should not be understood as causal since causality applies\nonly within the empirical realm. \n\nNonetheless, in cases of aesthetic experience (especially the\nsublime) the intellect does manage to free itself from the\nservitude of the will. Further, in cases of ascetic\n“salvation” from embodied existence, a person may even will\nto resign herself from willing altogether. Clearly there are actual\nmoments of human freedom in his view, the possibility of which is\nvouchsafed through the intelligible character and its near identity to\nthe will qua thing in itself; but exactly how freedom\n‘enters into’ the empirical realm in these cases remains,\nin Schopenhauer’s terms, quoting Malebranche, “a\nmystery” (WWR I, section 70, 431; see also FW epigraph). \n\n As in Kant’s aesthetics, genuine art on\nSchopenhauer’s view is the product of a genius or someone who has\nbeen “momentarily inspired to the point of genius” (WWR I,\n261). But he construes the creative process of the genius rather\ndifferently from Kant. For all of the fine arts save for\nmusic—which constitutes an important exception treated\nbelow—the genius produces art first by contemplating an Idea in\nnature or from human affairs. Sometimes the genius is aided by her\nimagination which allows her to perceive Ideas in possible as well as\nin actual experience. Then, with technical skill she embodies the\nIdeas she has perceived into a form (be it in marble, paint or words on\nthe printed page) that enables the Ideas to be perceived by others.\n In this way, the genius lends her superlative ability to perceive\nIdeas in actual or imagined things to the ordinary person, who can less\nreadily perceive Ideas from the phenomenal world. \n\nSchopenhauer sees a relationship between genius and madness.\n He believes that “every increase in intellect beyond the\nordinary measure is an abnormality that disposes one to madness”\n(WWR I, 215); since the genius is distinctive for her superfluity of\nintellect (WWR I, 211), which allows her to withdraw from mundane\nconcerns more often and more sustainedly in order to perceive the Ideas\nin things and in the patterns of human life, she is thus disposed to\nmadness. Also, geniuses resemble madmen insofar as they are often\nso engrossed in perceiving the essential in life that they pay little\nattention to particulars, and are generally terrible in practical\naffairs. But the real distinguishing factor between the\n“madman” and the genius has to do with memory. From\nhis “frequent visits to madhouses” and his reflections on\nthe symptoms of these real inmates as well as on those of characters in\nliterature who have gone insane (e.g., Ophelia, King Lear, Ajax),\nSchopenhauer hypothesizes that the mad lack reliable interconnections\nbetween past and present events, and in many cases this is due to some\ntraumatic event they have suffered in their past.  By contrast,\nthe genius has a memory that functions normally. \n\nThe differences among the fine arts (again, apart from music) have\nto do with the medium in which Ideas are copied and through which they\nmay be perceived by other subjects and thus transmitted. But the fine\narts also differ and admit of a hierarchy based on the hierarchical\n“ladder” of the Ideas that those art forms (and within art\nforms, genres) are suited to express.  Climbing the ladder of the\nwill’s objectification in Ideas from lowest to highest is a\nmatter of the increasing complexity and completeness in the\nwill’s phenomenal expression. And so, the same holds for the fine\narts—again, with the exception of music—whose sole aim, for\nSchopenhauer, is to copy the Ideas and thus for the genius to make them\nintuitively perceptible to others. \n\nOn the lowest rung of the fine-arts ladder, Schopenhauer places\narchitecture which  make[s] the objectivation of the will clear\nat the lowest level of its visibility, where it shows itself as the\ndull striving of mass, conforming to law but with no cognition.\n(WWR I, 283)  The Ideas embodied in architecture are mass, gravity,\nrigidity, light, and the Ideas of the materials utilized such as stone\nor wood. On the same rung Schopenhauer places artistic fountainry, the\naim of which is to reveal the objectivation of the will in fluid\nsubstances; this art form embodies the Ideas of fluidity, formlessness,\ntransparency, and the like. \n\nMoving up the ladder, Schopenhauer treats landscape gardening which\n“performs the same service for the higher levels of vegetable\nnature” that architecture and fountainry perform for non-living\nnature (WWR I, 243). The aim of this fine art is to promote the\nscenic beauty of an area by cultivating a variety of species in a\njuxtaposition and combination that allows the essential in each type of\nplant to emerge distinctly. Schopenhauer remarks, however, that\nthe landscape gardener exerts less control over her materials than does\nthe architect, and thus, the real beauty of this art form is due more\nto nature herself than to the artist. \n\nArriving at the art forms which portray sentient, living nature,\nSchopenhauer places paintings and sculptures of non-human animals on\nequal footing. These fine arts also treat the human form and enable\nthe perception of the Idea of humanity including the individuality of\nthe sitter or subject, in the case of portraiture and\nsculpture. Capturing the individuality of human beings is important\nfor the expression of the Idea of humanity “because to a certain\nextent, the human individual as such has the dignity of an Idea of his\nown” (WWR I, 251). \n\nWithin painting, Schopenhauer follows for the most part the\nhierarchy of genres set out by Academic painting at the time, classing\nstill-life and landscape painting below historical and genre\npainting. This ranking is due to the lower grades of the\nwill’s objectification in the usual subjects of still-life and\nlandscape painting:  fruits, flowers, animal carcasses, natural\nvistas and the like. But he departs from the traditional hierarchy of\nAcademic painting in his claim that the commoners and mundane scenes of\ngenre paintings are in no way inferior to grand historical figures and\nevents as subjects of painting,  because what is genuinely\nsignificant in historical subjects is not in fact what is individual,\nnot the particular event as such, but rather what is universal in it,\nthe aspect of the Idea of humanity that expresses itself through\nit. (WWR I, 257)   Thus, portrayals of peasants in a tavern\narguing over cards and dice is apt to be just as significant as\nportrayals of ministers in a palace arguing over maps and countries\n(WWR I, 256).  In fact, he believes an artist would do very well\nsolely to concentrate on the scenes, events, struggles and joys of the\nmasses in order to unfold the multifarious Idea of humanity in\npainting, sculpture or poetry.  \n\nThe aim of poetry, in which Schopenhauer includes all forms of\nliterature and drama, is to reveal and communicate the Ideas through\nthe medium of abstract concepts communicated by means of words. \n\nSchopenhauer uses an analogy from chemistry to describe the aim of the\ntrue poet.  Just as the chemist combines various liquids in order to\ndistill out precisely the solid precipitates she wants, the aim of the\npoet is to use abstract concepts but to restrict the generality of\nthese concepts (by the use of epithets and other vivid descriptors) to\n“precipitate” out precise images in the minds of her\nreaders, listeners, or spectators (WWR I, 269). The generality of its\nmaterial—the concept—allows poetry to express a vast\nnumber of Ideas.  It can range over all of nature, but is especially\napt to express the Idea of humanity in their actions, thoughts, and\nfeelings.  And in expressing this Idea in its multiplicity, poetry has\na distinct advantage over history, according to Schopenhauer (here\nfollowing Aristotle), for poetry is not beholden to actual events and\npeople, but rather to what is possible or probable and thus may better\ncapture what is truly significant in human existence. (For a\ncomparison between Schopenhauer and Early German Romantic thinkers on\npoetry, see Millán 2017). \n\nThe various genres of poetry express different facets of the Idea of\nhumanity: lyric poetry (including song) expresses the interior thoughts\nand feelings of humanity as a whole;  the novel, epic and drama\nare more “objective” types of literature which express the\nIdea of humanity through the portrayal of significant characters in\nsignificant situations. On the top rung of poetic art, for\nSchopenhauer, lies tragedy, whose goal is the “portrayal of the\nterrible aspect of life” where “the unspeakable pain, the\nmisery of humanity, the triumph of wickedness, the scornful domination\nof chance, and the hopeless fall of the righteous and the innocent are\nbrought before us” (WWR I, 280). \n\nSchopenhauer sees great cognitive as well as ethical significance in\nthe Ideas expressed in tragedy, for this genre offers\n“significant intimation as to the nature of the world and of\nexistence” and shakes a person’s natural tendency toward\noptimism. The one constant in tragedy is the “portrayal of\na great misfortune” (WWR I, 281), but this may be brought about,\non his account, in three main ways: (1) through the exceptional\nwickedness of certain characters (he gives as examples of this type\nShakespeare’s Richard III, Othello, and The\nMerchant of Venice, as well as Sophocles’ Antigone\namong others); (2) through blind fate (e.g., Sophocles’\nOedipus Tyrannus, “most of the tragedies of the\nancients,” Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet,\nVoltaire’s Tancred and Schiller’s The Bride of\nMessina); (3) through morally ordinary characters in their typical\nrelationships with each other. This last type of tragedy is the most\nvaluable, for Schopenhauer,  because it shows us the greatest\nmisfortune not as an exception, not as something brought about by rare\ncircumstances or monstrous characters, but rather as something that\ndevelops effortlessly and spontaneously out of people’s deeds and\ncharacters, almost as if it were essential, thereby bringing it\nterribly close to us. (WWR I, 282)  Tragedies of this type\nare more rare and more difficult to execute. Good specimens of\nthis type include Goethe’s Clavigo and Faust, \nShakespeare’s Hamlet in Hamlet’s relationship\nwith Laertes and Ophelia. Although Schopenhauer obviously did not live\nto see them, it is probable that he would have approved of Arthur\nMiller’s modern tragedies such as All My Sons and\nDeath of a Salesman which seem to fall entirely into this type\n(for more on Schopenhauer’s theory of tragedy and his solution to\nthe problems of tragedy see Tanner 1998; Neill 2003; Young 1987\n& 1992; and Shapshay 2012b). \n\nNo wonder that Schopenhauer was the darling of composers in the\n19th and 20th centuries, for he argued that music\nhas a truly exceptional status among the arts and uniquely reveals the\nessence of the “in itself” of the world. Music that\naffords such insight—the only music he deems worthy of the\nname—is Classical/Romantic, non-programmatic music without a\ntext, or what was termed late in the 19th century,\n“absolute music.” Unlike all of the other arts, which\nexpress or copy the Ideas (the essential features of the phenomenal\nworld), Schopenhauer affirmed that music expresses or copies the will\nqua thing in itself, bypassing the Ideas altogether.\n This puts music and the Ideas on a par in terms of the directness\nof their expression of the thing in itself (WWR I, 285). In order to\nunderstand Schopenhauer’s reasoning for this rather stunning view\nof the cognitive significance of music, one needs to pay attention to\nthe role of feeling in Schopenhauer’s epistemology, and\nespecially to the feeling of embodiment that a subject can experience\nby attending to ordinary acts of volition. \n\n It is the feeling of embodiment—the intuitive, immediate\nknowledge that one wills when, for instance, one wills to\nraise one’s arm—that is monumentally significant for\nSchopenhauer in his identification of the Kantian thing in itself with\nwill. First-personal knowledge that one wills is\nimmediate, rather than inferred from observation, according to\nSchopenhauer, and is shorn of all of the forms of the PSR (including\nspace, causality, and even being-an-object-for-a-subject) with one\nexception, the form of time. \n\nSimilarly, Schopenhauer holds that the experience of\n“absolute” music (music that does not seek to imitate the\nphenomenal world and is unaccompanied by narrative or text), occurs in\ntime, but does not involve any of the other cognitive conditions on\nexperience. Thus, like the feeling of embodiment, Schopenhauer believes\nthe experience of music brings us epistemically closer to the essence\nof the world as will—it is as direct an experience of the will\nqua thing in itself as is possible for a human being to have. \nAbsolutely direct experience of the will is impossible, because it will\nalways be mediated by time, but in first-personal experience of\nvolition and the experience of music the thing in itself is no longer\nveiled by our other forms of cognitive conditioning. Thus, these\nexperiences are epistemically distinctive and metaphysically\nsignificant. \n\nSince the will expresses itself in Ideas as well as in music,\nSchopenhauer reasons that there must be analogies between them. \nIndeed, he draws out many such structural analogies: between the bass\nnotes of harmony and the lower grades of objectification of the will in\ninorganic nature; between melody and the human being’s\n“most secret story,” that is, “every emotion, every\nstriving, every movement of the will, everything that reason collects\nunder the broad and negative concept of feeling” (WWR I, 287);\nrhythms such as those of dance music are analogous to easy, common\nhappiness, while the allegro maestoso corresponds to grand,\nnoble strivings after distant goals; the “inexhaustibility”\nof possible melodies is analogous to the “inexhaustibility of\nnature in the variety of individuals, physiognomies and life\nhistories.” (WWR I, 288). \n\nNotwithstanding these and many other analogies Schopenhauer draws\nbetween music and the Ideas, he underscores the notion that music does\nnot imitate appearances, but rather expresses the will as directly as\npossible. It does this predominantly by expressing universal\nfeelings:  it does not express this or that\nindividual or particular joy, this or that sorrow or pain or horror or\nexaltation or cheerfulness or peace of mind, but rather joy, sorrow,\npain, horror, exaltation, cheerfulness and peace of mind as such in\nthemselves, abstractly…, (WWR I, 289)   \n\nHe supports this account of music first as an inference to the best\nexplanation.  By the third book of his main work, Schopenhauer\ntakes for granted that the reader has been at least somewhat convinced\nby the metaphysics for which he has argued. In addition,\nSchopenhauer holds that people often feel that music is the most\npowerful of all the arts, affording a “profound pleasure with\nwhich we see the deepest recesses of our nature find\nexpression.”  And he draws our attention to what today we\nmight call, ‘the soundtrack effect,’ i.e., p\nthe fact\nthat, when music suitable to any scene, action, event, or environment\nis played, it seems to disclose to us its most secret meaning, and\nappears to be the most accurate and distinct commentary on it.\n(WWR I, 262)  Finally, for Schopenhauer, “to the man who gives himself up\nentirely to the impression of a symphony, it is as if he saw all the\npossible events of life and of the world passing by within\nhimself” yet without being able to pinpoint any likeness of\nevents in life to the music he has experienced. Given all of this,\nSchopenhauer believes his explanation—music is a copy of the\nwill qua thing in itself—is justified as an inference\nto the best explanation of the experience, power and significance of\nmusic in the lives of serious listeners.  He believes that his\nmetaphysics of music finally does justice to the profound pleasure and\nsignificance that the musically sensitive experience when\nlistening to truly great music. (On tensions between this\nrather joyful description of the experience of music and\nSchopenhauer’s pessimism, see Norman 2017.) \n\nIn addition to this inference to the best explanation, Schopenhauer\nalso appeals to readers of his theory to check it against their own\nexperiences of music.  And it is with respect to this second way\nof supporting his account of music that, with admirable frankness, he\nconfronts the limits of his theorizing: \nI recognize, however, that it is essentially impossible to\ndemonstrate this explanation [Aufschluß], for it assumes and\nestablishes a relation of music as a representation to that which of\nits essence can never be representation, and claims to regard music as\nthe copy of an original that can itself never be directly represented.\nTherefore, I can do no more than state here at the end of this third\nbook, devoted mainly to a consideration of the arts, this explanation\nof the wonderful art of tones which is sufficient for me. I must leave\nthe acceptance or denial of my view to the effect that both music and\nthe whole thought communicated in this work have on each reader.\nMoreover, I regard it as necessary, in order that a man may assent with\ngenuine conviction to the explanation of the significance of music here\nto be given, that he should often listen to music with constant\nreflection on this; and this again requires that he should be already\nvery familiar with the whole thought I expound. (WWR I, 257) \n\nIf a serious and sensitive listener heeds Schopenhauer’s\nadvice and listens often to music with Schopenhauer’s philosophy\nfirmly in mind, and this listener is still not convinced by\nhis theory, what then?  Schopenhauer concedes that in this case\nthere is nothing more he can say. \nApparently, however, many serious and sensitive listeners and\ncomposers have been somewhat swayed by his account of music (for his\ninfluence on music theorist Heinrich Schenker, see Cubero 2017). Of\nall of the facets of Schopenhauer’s aesthetics, none has exerted\na greater influence.  The theory had a deep influence on Brahms,\nWagner, Mahler and Schönberg (see Goehr 1998, and Magee 1997,\nchapter 17), and is echoed in Susanne Langer’s theory of musical\nsymbolism (Langer 1953; see also Alperson 1981). Analogizing\nSchopenhauer’s influence on musical aesthetics to\nBeethoven’s influence in classical music itself, Goehr avers\nthat Schopenhauer became “a central reference point” in\nthe most important debates in the history of musical aesthetics\n(Goehr, 1996: 200). \n\nThere are a number of connections that Schopenhauer explicitly (but\nmore often inexplicitly) drew between aesthetic experience and both his\nethics of compassion and salvation. In a strange but revelatory\npassage at the end of section 35 of Book III, Schopenhauer puts these\nwords into the mouth of the ‘spirit of the earth’ [der\nErdgeist]: \nTrue loss is just as impossible as true gain in this world of\nappearance. Only the will exists: it, the thing in itself, is the\nsource of all those appearances. Its self-knowledge and its consequent\ndecision to affirm or to negate is the only event in itself. (WWR I,\n207) \n\nIf one interprets this passage as espousing the view that the only\nreally free choice an individual has is to affirm or negate the will\nto live after one has gained self-knowledge, then one can see a great\nethical significance for art and aesthetic experience in its\ncognitive dimension in this thought, for it is only by way of\naesthetic experience that one gains intuitive knowledge of the Ideas,\nor, in the case of music, of the nature of the will itself. Music\nespecially involves feeling universal emotions, emotions shorn of\nparticular context, motive or individual. In so far as we feel\nconnected to all others on the level of feeling, then music has a\ndirect connection with Schopenhauer’s ethics of compassion, for\nthe feeling that we are indeed not ultimately separate individuals but\nare rather unified in the in-itself of the world constitutes the basic\nintuitive knowledge at the root of the ethical attitude of\ncompassion. \n\nSince aesthetic experience is the only way to gain true\nunderstanding of the world and existence in all its multiplicity, this\nmeans that aesthetic experience is a necessary pre-condition for making\nthe ethical choice as outlined in the quote above, to\naffirm or deny the will, the “only event in itself”. Thus\nthe unique cognitive significance of art and aesthetic experience in\ngeneral turns out to have crucial ethical importance. \n\nA second way in which aesthetic experience has ethical importance\nfor Schopenhauer is as an experience of negative freedom—freedom\nfrom the servitude to the will to life. In the case of the\nbeautiful, one gains an experiential insight into a will-less state,\none in which the subject perceives the world in a non-egoistic manner.\n Schopenhauer’s ethics is based on taking a compassionate\nstance on and acting for the benefit of others. So the experience\nof aesthetic will-lessness affords some felt recognition of a necessary\nfirst step on that path to compassion, namely, a non-egoistic\nattitude. \n\nArguably, the experience of the sublime affords a felt recognition not\nonly of a subject’s negative but also of her positive freedom,\nthat is, a freedom to release herself from the service of the will to\nlife. Thus, the self-consciousness involved in sublime experience\naffords a felt recognition of one’s ability to change\none’s attitudes and behavior—actively to turn one’s\nattention away from one’s egoistic strivings for a time.  \n\nThe ethical relevance of the sublime is most apparent in\nSchopenhauer’s treatment of tragedy.  In tragedy—the\nhighest degree of dynamically sublime feeling—one is both\nconfronted by terrible truths about the world and existence and\nelevated by the sense that one is not utterly powerless in the face of\nit. One comes to the felt recognition that one has the power to do\nsomething in the face of the tragic nature of the world.\n Schopenhauer recommends resignation (extreme denial of the will\nto life) but his ethical theory admits of degrees of negation—by\nacting in a less egoistic fashion or further in a truly compassionate\nmanner. \n\nThere is, of course, the other option:  Affirmation of the will\nto life in light of self-knowledge.  This must be a genuine\noption, for Schopenhauer, otherwise the choice to affirm or negate\nwould not constitute a true choice. Interestingly,\nSchopenhauer spends little time exploring this option. Perhaps he\nthought that anyone with true self-knowledge would experience\nan anagnorisis or moment of tragic recognition, and, ashamed\nand horrified at the will to life within him, would generally choose\nnegation over affirmation.  It was left to Nietzsche and his\ngrappling with tragedy and pessimism, to question whether affirmation\nmight yet be a defensible option.","contact.mail":"sshapsha@indiana.edu","contact.domain":"indiana.edu"}]
