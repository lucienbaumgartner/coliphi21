W. F.\nHegel and F. H. Bradley) that all aspects of reality, including those\nwe experience as disconnected or contradictory, are ultimately unified\nin the thought of a single all-encompassing consciousness. Royce also\nmade original contributions in ethics, philosophy of community,\nphilosophy of religion and logic. His major works include The\nReligious Aspect of Philosophy (1885), The World and the\nIndividual (1899–1901), The Philosophy of Loyalty\n(1908), and The Problem of Christianity (1913). Royce’s\nfriendly but longstanding dispute with William James, known as\n“The Battle of the Absolute,” deeply influenced both\nphilosophers’ thought. In his later works, Royce reconceived his\nmetaphysics as an “absolute pragmatism” grounded in\nsemiotics. This view dispenses with the Absolute Mind of previous\nidealism and instead characterizes reality as a universe of ideas or\nsigns which occur in a process of being interpreted by an infinite\ncommunity of minds. These minds, and the community they constitute,\nmay themselves be understood as signs. Royce’s ethics,\nphilosophy of community, philosophy of religion, and logic reflect\nthis metaphysical position. \n\nRoyce was born November 20, 1855, in the remote mining town of Grass\nValley, California, to Josiah and Sarah Eleanor Bayliss Royce. Sarah\nRoyce was a devout Christian who headed a primary school in Grass\nValley. Royce’s mother and older sisters directed his early\neducation. At age 11 he entered school in San Francisco. He graduated\nfrom the newly established University of California in Oakland with a\nB. A. degree in Classics in 1875. Royce then traveled to Germany to\nstudy philosophy for one year, mastering the language and attending\nlectures in Heidelberg, Leipzig, and Göttingen. On his return, he\nentered the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he\nearned a Ph. D. in 1878. \nHe taught composition and literature at the University of California,\nBerkeley from 1878–1882. During this time he published numerous\nphilosophical articles, as well as his Primer of Logical\nAnalysis. He married Katherine Head in 1880. The couple had three\nchildren (Christopher 1882; Edward 1886; Stephen 1889) and remained\nmarried until Josiah’s death. Not content in California, so far\nfrom the intellectual life of the East Coast, Royce sought help in\nattaining a new post from his acquaintances there. In his later\nethical writings Royce would stress the centrality of action intended\nto realize a sound ideal that one has freely embraced. When offered\nthe opportunity to replace William James during a one year sabbatical\nat Harvard University, Royce acted: he accepted the offer of half of\nJames’s salary, resigned his California appointment altogether,\nand moved his wife and newborn son across the continent in the summer\nof 1882. \nIn Cambridge, Royce commenced to work doggedly and in diverse areas.\nIn January 1883 he arrived at an insight that proved fundamental to\nhis philosophy: in order for our ordinary concepts of truth and error\nto be meaningful, there must be an Absolute Knower, an actual infinite\nmind that encompasses the totality of all actual truths and possible\nerrors. This insight formed the core of his first major philosophical\npublication, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy, which\nappeared in 1885. Royce received a permanent appointment as assistant\nprofessor at Harvard in that same year. (During his three decades at\nHarvard Royce would teach such notable students as T. S. Eliot, George\nSantayana, and W. E. B. Du Bois.) He taught full time, gave many\npublic lectures, published his History of California in 1886,\nand a novel in 1887. In 1888 he experienced a nervous breakdown, from\nwhich he recovered after a sea voyage of some months’\nduration. \nRoyce was appointed Professor of the History of Philosophy at Harvard\nin 1892 and served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy from\n1894–98. During these years Royce established himself as a\nleading figure in American academic philosophy with his many reviews,\nlectures and books, including The Spirit of Modern Philosophy\n(1892) and The Conception of God (1895). In 1898 Royce\nattended a series of lectures by Charles S. Peirce, “Reasoning\nand the Logic of Things,” which significantly influenced his\nunderstanding of the relation between logic and metaphysics. \nRoyce delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of\nAberdeen in two series, the first in 1899 and the second the following\nyear. He regarded this as the opportunity to consolidate his years of\nhard thought and study, so as to produce a definitive and original\nstatement of his metaphysics. The result was his two volume opus\nThe World and the Individual (1899–1901). \nThe Gifford Lectures marked a turning point in Royce’s life and\nthought. He had worked out his philosophical theories in minute\ndetail. His public reputation as a philosopher was sealed (Royce was\nelected president of the American Psychological Association in 1902\nand of the American Philosophical Association in 1903). The year 1900\napparently represented the culmination of his life’s work. Royce\nwas only 45 years old, though, and this culmination proved also to be\na starting point for significant growth. \nReviews of The World and the Individual praised Royce’s\nphilosophical acumen but raised significant objections to his\nconclusions. Peirce, in particular, pointedly criticized Royce’s\nuse of logic. Royce set out to reconsider his central arguments and,\nat the same time, undertook an ambitious program of study in\nmathematical logic. In his teaching and publications after 1900, two\nphilosophical strains came to the forefront. One was a growing\nreliance on formal logical and mathematical concepts as the basis for\nhis metaphysical speculation (the first hint of this appears in the\n“Supplementary Essay” to the first volume of The World\nand the Individual). The second was an emphasis on philosophy as\na means to understand the concrete phenomena of life: the nature of\nhuman society, of religious experience, of ethical action, of\nsuffering and the problem of evil. \nAfter 1907 Royce’s emphasis on the relevance of philosophy for\nliving took on a clear personal dimension. In that year Christopher,\nwho had come with Josiah and Katherine across the continent as a\nnewborn 25 years earlier, and who had graduated from Harvard at age\n18, showed symptoms of severe depression and psychotic delusions. In\n1908 his parents committed him to a state mental hospital with little\nhope that he would recover. In August of 1910 William James died,\nleaving Royce without his closest friend, neighbor and colleague. In\nSeptember of the same year Christopher Royce died of typhoid fever,\nleaving Josiah and Katherine without their firstborn child. Royce had\nearlier stated his philosophy in a somewhat abstract and formal way,\nso that it might help him discover metaphysical truth. Perhaps under\nthe weight of these later sorrows, Royce returned to his system\nseeking wisdom and understanding in addition to truth. \nHowever that may be, and though he by no means abandoned systematic\nand theoretical philosophy, Royce began to write more about what today\nwould be called “practical” or “applied”\nphilosophy. His major work on ethics, The Philosophy of\nLoyalty, appeared in 1908. Later he would address ethics in even\nmore practical terms, not as a philosophy but as an “art”\nof loyalty. He published a collection of essays under the title\nRace Questions, Provincialism, and Other American Problems in\n1908; another collection, entitled William James and Other Essays\non the Philosophy of Life, appeared in 1911. Four of the six\nessays in The Hope of the Great Community, written in the\nlast year of his life and published posthumously in 1916, directly\nconcerned global politics and the Great War. \nRoyce and James had always disagreed deeply concerning the proper\nunderstanding of religious phenomena in human life. When James\ndelivered the Gifford Lectures in 1901 and 1902, he directed many\narguments against Royce’s idealism, though he did not there\ntarget his friend by name. James’s lectures, published as\nThe Varieties of Religious Experience, were a popular and\nacademic success . Royce believed that James, who had never been\nregularly affiliated with an established church or religious\ncommunity, had in that work placed too much emphasis on the\nextraordinary religious experiences of extraordinary individuals.\nRoyce’s first education was into a strongly Protestant world\nview, he always retained a respect for the conventions of organized\nChristianity, and his writings exhibit a consistent and deep\nfamiliarity with Scripture. He sought a philosophy of religion that\ncould help one understand and explain the phenomena of ordinary\nreligious faith as experienced by communities of ordinary people.\nThere was a deeper difference between them, as well, and it centered\non a metaphysical point. Royce’s 1883 insight concerning the\nAbsolute was at bottom a religious insight. Contrary to the open-ended\npluralism and pragmatism of James, Royce was convinced that the object\nand source of religious experience was an actual, infinite, and\nsuperhuman being. Royce did not attempt to work out his religious\nphilosophy until after James’s death, however. In 1911 Royce\nfinally composed the lectures that responded to James. These were\npublished in 1912 as The Sources of Religious Insight. It is\nhere that the theoretical and practical threads of his late thought\nbegan to come together. Royce himself said of the Sources:\n“It contains the whole of me in a brief compass”\n(Clendenning 1970, 570). \nIn early 1912, Royce suffered a stroke. During his recovery, he\ncontinued to explore the philosophy of religion outlined in the\nSources, with an eye toward adapting these ideas specifically\nto Christianity. He also returned to Peirce’s writings, seeking\nthe solution to certain nagging problems in his own metaphysics. He\nfound in Peirce’s semeiotic, or theory of signs, the technical\ntools he needed to address both issues at once. The Problem of\nChristianity presents, in place of the earlier Absolute Knower,\nthe concept of an infinite community of interpretation guided by a\nshared spirit of truth-seeking. This Universal Community, which\nconstitutes reality, develops greater understanding over time through\nits members’ continual development of the meaning of signs.\nWithin this framework Royce endeavored to reconcile and explain many\nkey Christian doctrines and experiences. \nThough Royce lived only a few years beyond this late philosophical\nbreakthrough, his last period brought the true culmination and\nflowering of his life’s work. Besides The Sources of\nReligious Insight and The Problem of Christianity,\nnotable available works include The Hope of the Great\nCommunity, his last Harvard seminar on Metaphysics\n(1915–16) and a series of lectures given at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley. These lectures at his alma mater were to have\nended with a talk entitled “The Spirit of the Community.”\nWhen the Great War broke out, Royce set this manuscript aside and\nsketched a practical proposal to use the economic power of insurance\nto mediate hostilities among nations and hence reduce the attraction\nof war in the future. War and Insurance (1914) was a daring\npolitical and economic proposal on behalf of the Universal\nCommunity. \nRoyce died on September 14, 1916. Though scholars now recognize the\noriginality and strength of his last works, he was unable to respond\nto critics or to press his case for the last crucial innovations to\nhis philosophy. His reputation was eclipsed as other philosophers used\nRoyce’s earlier writings as a foil in developing their own\ndoctrines of pragmatism, realism, empiricism, and logical analysis.\nWhile scholars of American intellectual life have always acknowledged\nthe historical importance of Royce’s influence, recent years\nhave brought a revival of interest in Royce’s thought on its own\nterms. Royce’s work is proving especially fruitful for\ntheologians and philosophers interested in speculative philosophy and\nmetaphysics, practical and theoretical ethics, philosophy of religion,\nand the philosophy of community. \nRoyce’s early studies in Germany and at the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity concentrated on the development of post-Kantian idealism.\nHis philosophical work as a whole may be regarded as a committed\nidealist’s effort to understand the place of finite individuals\nin an infinite universe, a theme that Royce captured most succinctly\nin his Gifford Lectures title, “The World and the\nIndividual.” This theme will serve as a touchstone in the\nfollowing survey of Royce’s work in metaphysics and\nepistemology, ethics and practical philosophy, religious philosophy,\nand logic. \nRoyce announced the beginning of his professional career with a novel\ndefense of absolute idealism, “the argument from error.”\nKant had introduced the notion of a “transcendental\nargument” by asking what the world must be like in order for\nknowledge of the world to be possible. In The Religious Aspect of\nPhilosophy Royce took the experience of error — a\nparticularly compelling aspect of the phenomenon of knowing — as\nthe starting point for his own transcendental argument. According to\nthe correspondence theory of knowledge an idea (or judgment) is true\nif it correctly represents its object; error obtains when an idea does\nnot correctly represent its object. It is indisputable that finite\nminds do sometimes entertain erroneous ideas. Royce pointed out that\nin such a case the mind must contain an (erroneous) idea and its\n(false) object, while simultaneously intending, or “pointing\ntoward,” the idea’s true object. If the mind is able to\nintend the true object then that object is somehow available to the\nmind. How can it be that the true object is in this way available to\nthe mind, but not known? Consider what happens in an ordinary example\nof error: if I think that my keys are on the table, but later discover\nthat they are in my pocket, I do not conclude that my keys never\nexisted as the object of my thought. Rather, I focus on an idea that I\nhad all along — that my keys do definitely exist somewhere. The\nkeys, their location, and all other facts about them are the true\nobject of an idea. At the moment when I discover that my keys are not\non the table, it becomes apparent that this true object was only\nimperfectly available to me. The fact that such error does occur\nindicated to Royce that the true object of any idea must exist, in a\nfully determinate or absolute state, in some actual mind with which my\nown mind is or may be connected. From the possibility of error, Royce\nconcluded that there is an Absolute Knower, a mind for which all\nthoughts do correspond correctly and adequately to their true\nobjects. \nOne objection to the argument from error is that another type of\nobjective reality, some other sort of being external to one’s\nfinite mind, might explain the possibility of error just as well.\nRoyce took up this objection in the first volume of The World and\nthe Individual, which was subtitled “The Four Historical\nConceptions of Being.” In this extended argument Royce critiqued\nwhat he regarded as the main competing conceptions of objective\nreality so as to strengthen his case for idealism. The first\nconception of being Royce considered was realism, the view\nthat the world exists entirely independently of our thoughts or ideas\nabout it. The world is what it is, in short, without any reference to\nour thoughts. While this view has great common-sense appeal and does\nprovide for an objectively existing sphere of being against which our\nideas can apparently be measured, Royce pointed out a fundamental\nproblem. Realism, so defined, introduces a radical metaphysical\ndualism. Between my ideas, and a sphere of being that by definition\nexists completely independent of those ideas, there is a gap that\ncannot be bridged. Realism posits an objective realm that is utterly\nindependent and hence, strictly speaking, is utterly meaningless to\nthought. The theory of mysticism, the second conception of\nbeing Royce considers, likewise meets with problems. This view\nmaintains that the real is the ineffable immediate fact that is\npresent to the mind. Mysticism avoids the problem of an unbridgeable\ngap between idea and reality by completely denying any such gap. The\ndifficulty here is that one cannot then distinguish between idea and\nreality. If reality is in the end the immediate content of my idea,\nthen error in my idea of reality would simply appear to be impossible.\nThe third conception of being, which Royce identifies with Kantian\ncritical rationalism, is presented as a correct but\nincomplete view. Royce characterizes critical rationalism as the view\nthat “What is, gives warrant to ideas, makes them true, and\nenables us to define determinate, or valid, possible\nexperiences” (Royce 1899–1901 [1976, 266]). The real is\nthat which, in conforming to given universal structures or categories\nof experience, is capable of validating certain ideas. The connection\nbetween my ideas and an objectively existing sphere of being is\nclearly established: my ideas and that sphere both conform to the same\ncategories of experience. The independence of objective reality, and\nhence the possibility of error, is likewise preserved: I may form an\nidea of a definite possible experience (e.g., that my keys are on the\ntable) but then discover that reality does not validate my idea (I can\nin fact check the table surface and discover that my keys are not\nthere). The critical rationalist conception is inadequate, in\nRoyce’s view, because it is restricted to describing the\nuniversal forms and possibilities of experienced reality. It cannot in\nRoyce’s view account for the concrete, actual individual facts\nthat impose themselves in experience. These are simply and\nmysteriously “given” in the critical rationalist\ntheory. \nRoyce endeavored to extend and complete critical rationalism in his\nexplanation of the “fourth conception of being.”\nTo say that an idea intends its object means more than that the idea\nmay be validated by a “possible experience.” An idea in\nthis respect embodies a purpose: that its meaning shall be fulfilled\nin experience. In Royce’s view this requires a world that is\nmore than the abstract or merely hypothetical content posited by the\ndescription of a possible experience. What is needed is a definite,\nactual individual being that exists “in an absolutely final\nform.” Royce thus agrees with critical rationalism in saying\nthat a true idea is one that may be fulfilled or validated by a\npossible experience. He argues further, though, that such a possible\nexperience requires the existence of an actual being (e.g., the\nparticular set of keys in my pocket) that is in principle capable of\nbeing experienced. It is this being, the actual individual, and not\nthe mere possible experience of it, that is the object of knowledge\nand “the essential nature of Being” (Royce\n1899–1901, [1976, 348]). The “fourth conception of\nbeing” detailed in The World and the Individual\nprovides the metaphysical background for the remainder of\nRoyce’s thought. It presents a view of the totality of Being as\nan actual Infinite Individual that is itself timeless, encompassing as\nit does all valid past, present, and future possible experience of\nfact. All finite beings, such as ourselves, are but fragments of this\nAbsolute Mind or eternal truth. \nIn his last period Royce embraced what may be called a hermeneutic\nepistemology. While he still maintained the central notion that a true\nidea correctly represents its object, he arrived at a new\nunderstanding of the nature of representation. Earlier, he had rather\nuncritically taken “representation” to be a\nstraightforward correspondence relation in which the idea merely\ncopied its object. Under the influence of Peirce’s theory of\nsigns, however, Royce came to appreciate the creative, synthetic, and\nselective aspects of representation. The new semiotic conception is\ndetailed in the chapter of The Problem of Christianity\nentitled “Perception, Conception and Interpretation.”\nKnowledge is not at bottom merely the accurate and complete perception\nof an object, as empiricism would have it. Nor is it the accurate and\ncomplete conception of an idea, as rationalism maintains. Knowledge is\ninstead a process of interpretation: the true idea selects,\nemphasizes, and re-presents those aspects of the object that will be\nmeaningfully fulfilled in subsequent experience. Royce’s\n“absolute pragmatism,” like other versions of pragmatism,\nthus offers an alternative to rationalism and empiricism. \nThis revised understanding of knowledge as interpretation prompted, if\nit did not exactly require, a corresponding change in Royce’s\nnotion of the Infinite Mind whose reality was established in the\nargument from error. As long as knowledge is regarded as possessing\nperceptions or conceptions that correspond to objects, the Infinite\nMind is naturally envisioned as something that “contains”\nthe totality of all perceptions or conceptions. If knowledge is\ninstead regarded as a process of interpretation, though, the Infinite\nMind may be regarded as the mind that carries this process forward.\nRoyce had long sought an explicitly non-Hegelian account of Absolute\nMind. In The Problem of Christianity he was finally able to\nreplace the old terminology of the Absolute with a description of an\ninfinite Community of Interpretation. This community is the totality\nof all those minds capable of representing aspects of Being to one\nanother or to their future selves. Royce summarized the metaphysical\nimplications of this new view by saying “the real world is the\nCommunity of Interpretation… If the interpretation is a\nreality, and if it truly interprets the whole of reality, then the\ncommunity reaches its goal [i.e., a complete representation of Being],\nand the real world includes its own interpreter” (Royce 1913\n[2001, 339]). In this late period Royce remained firmly committed to\nidealism. He renounced the notion that the Absolute is complete at any\nactual time, though, and instead preferred to think of the possible\ntotality of all truth simply as the eternal. \nThat Royce’s metaphysical solution to the problem of error was\nof broad relevance for the rest of his philosophy is clear: “The\nexistence of error…must be explained as due to the same\nconditions as those which make possible finite life, evil,\nindividuality, and conflict in general” (Robinson 123). Error is\npossible, according to Royce, only if there is an infinite being for\nwhich all intended objects could be realized. This Being (whether\nconceived as Absolute Mind or the infinite Community of\nInterpretation) also makes individual human life comprehensible.\nRoyce’s considerable attention to speculative metaphysics is\ncomplemented by his concern for the practical implications of that\nmetaphysics. The infinite manifests itself in the realm of individual\nbeings bound within the constraints of time, space, and finitude.\nEthics and religion have their basis in this relation of the\nindividual to the infinite real world, a relation Royce characterized\nin terms of loyalty. \nNear the end of The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce wrote: \nRoyce’s ethics is rooted in his analysis of the conditions\nnecessary for an individual life to be meaningful. It is not enough\nthat one’s actions merely conform to the strictures of\nconventional morality — a trained animal might well fulfill such\nminimal conditions of morality. To lead a morally significant life,\none’s actions must express a self-consciously asserted will.\nThey must contribute toward realizing a plan of life, a plan that is\nitself unified by some freely chosen aim. Such an aim and its\ncorresponding plan of life could not easily be created by an\nindividual out of the chaos of conflicting personal desires and\nimpulses that we all encounter. Rather, such aims and plans are found\nalready largely formed in social experience: we come to consciousness\nin a world that proffers countless well-defined causes and programs\nfor their accomplishment. These programs extend through time and\nrequire the contributions of many individuals for their advancement.\nWhen one judges a cause to be worthwhile and freely embraces such a\nprogram, several momentous things happen. The individual’s will\nis focused and defined in terms of the shared cause. The individual\nbecomes allied with a community of others who are also committed to\nthe same cause. Finally, a morally significant commitment to the cause\nand to the community develops. This commitment is what Royce calls\n“loyalty.” The moral life may be understood in terms of\nthe multiple loyalties that a person exhibits. \nJust as the truth value of an idea is a matter of whether its intended\nobject is fulfilled in reality, the moral value of actions is a matter\nof whether they are loyal, whether they tend to fulfill the\ncommunity’s intended aim. Loyalty is a necessary condition for\nmoral validity; defined narrowly, as Royce prefers, loyalty may even\nbe a sufficient condition for moral validity. Royce’s narrow\ndefinition of loyalty, of “true loyalty,” is intended to\nrule out loyalty to morally evil causes and the communities that serve\nthem. Royce observes that the highest moral achievements throughout\nhistory have involved individuals’ loyalty to ideals that\npromote the formation and expansion of communities of loyalty. Many of\nthe worst deeds have also involved a high degree of loyalty, but this\nloyalty is directed exclusively to a particular group and is expressed\nin the destruction of the conditions for others’ loyal actions,\nof those other persons, and even of one’s own community and\ncause. Royce generalized the difference between true loyalty and\nvicious or “predatory” loyalty as follows: \nWhile every community hopes for the accomplishment of its central\ncause, and sees that cause’s fulfillment as its highest\nachievement, Royce places particularly high emphasis on the phenomenon\nof loyalty to a lost cause. A lost cause is not in Royce’s view\na hopeless cause, but rather one that cannot be fulfilled within the\nactual lifetime of the community or any of its members. Many lost\ncauses are rightly lost, of course: Royce would have recognized the\nConfederate States’ defense of slavery during the U.S. Civil War\nas such a case. Besides such misguided causes, though, there are a\nnumber of legitimate causes that are, by this definition,\n“lost” simply in virtue of their scope and magnitude. Such\ncauses are not hopeless, however. It is precisely these causes that\nestablish ideals capable of evoking our highest hope and moral\ncommitment. \nChief among these are the universal causes of the full attainment of\ntruth, the complete determination of the nature of reality through\ninquiry and interpretation, and of the establishment of universal\nloyalty to loyalty itself. In practice, the formula of “loyalty\nto loyalty” demands that one’s moral and intellectual\nsphere become ever broader and remain critical at all levels. All the\ncommunities we actually know, those we inhabit and identify with, are\nfinite and to some degree “predatory” in Royce’s\nsense. This is clearly true of small social cliques, isolated\nintellectual communities, parochial religious groups, self-interested\nunions and corporations, local political movements, and other such\ngroups. Roycean loyalty requires one to scrutinze the aims and actions\nof such communities and to work to reform their disloyal aspects. The\nphilosophy of loyalty calls us first of all, then, to create and\nembrace more cosmopolitan and inclusionary communities. It should be\nclear that this is only the first important step of an infinite\nprocess aimed at realizing the ideal of universal loyalty. Any actual\ncommunity, whether it be the United Nations or a bickering family,\nwill in fact fall short of perfect loyalty. When it does so, each must\nanswer to the same critical scrutiny and calls for reform. There is no\nexpectation that these high ideals of perfect loyalty, truth and\nreality will ever be fully realized. These “lost causes”\nare indispensible, in Royce’s view, as the source of absolute\nnorms for any community and its members. \nRoyce maintained that the logic of volition, pursued far enough,\ncompels us to embrace precisely these lost causes as our own. In the\ncourse of his extended debate with James over the adequacy of\npragmatism as a doctrine, Royce came to accept many of James’s\nprinciples. One, inspired by James’s well-known essay “The\nWill to Believe,” is that any philosophical view is at bottom an\nexpression of individual volition. Given the fact of our existence in\nthe world, we must first decide how we are to approach that world, and\nthen develop our philosophical theories accordingly. A second\nprinciple that Royce adopted is the pragmatist view of truth: truth is\nthe property possessed by those ideas that succeed in the long run.\nRoyce’s main disagreements with pragmatism concern the way these\ntwo principles are typically understood. Royce maintains that although\nthere are several possible attitudes of the will that one might adopt\ntoward the world (including Schopenhauer’s “will to\nlive” and its opposite, resignation) only one — loyalty to\nthe ideal of an ultimate truth — is correct. The other possible\nattitudes of the will are self-refuting. He accordingly refers to his\nown position as “Absolute Voluntarism” (Royce 1913 [2001,\n349]). Royce offers a similar argument concerning the pragmatist notion\nof truth (Royce 1913 [2001, 279]). Explicitly adopting one of\nPeirce’s concepts, Royce argues that to define truth using any\nconception of “the long run” — short of the ideal\nend of inquiry — is self-refuting. Given the apparent finality\nof this argument (which is, again, a variation of the Argument from\nError) Royce calls his position “Absolute Pragmatism.” \nRoyce’s philosophy of loyalty resembles existentialism in\ncertain respects. Notable among these are the notions that we come to\nmoral awareness in a world of already established aims and social\nprojects, that moral responsibility requires a self-conscious and\ndeliberate individual choice to embrace particular causes, and that\nthe highest forms of ethical conduct involve dedication and effort in\nservice of a cause that offers no promise of final success. Royce\ndiffers from later existentialists such as Camus and Sartre, however,\nin several important respects. Royce would not accept their notion\nthat human efforts are finally absurd, unfolding against a backdrop of\na meaningless and indifferent universe. On the contrary, Royce\nmaintains that the concepts of ultimate meaning and reality are\npowerful and legitimate forces in our lives. With existentialism,\nRoyce recognizes the very real chasms that separate one person’s\nfeelings, thoughts, and will from another: the experience of another\nmay be inscrutable. At the same time, though, he insists that we\nacknowledge the equally important fact that in ordinary social life\nminds frequently do work in concert. Groups of people often are\nunified in feeling, thought, and will by something that transcends any\nof the individuals present (Royce 1913 [2001, 239]). \nRoyce was one of the first American philosophers to recognize the\nimportant challenge of Nietzsche’s moral vision, which\ncelebrates those individuals who seek to exercise their autonomous\nwill to a “socially idealized” power. Such heroic\nindividualism, also associated with Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nand William James, proves unsatisfactory in Royce’s view (Royce\n1908 [1995, 41]). Their inspiring ethical visions are doomed to\nineffectiveness precisely because of their extreme individualism.\n“There is only one way to be an ethical individual. That is to\nchoose your cause, and then to serve it, as the Samurai his feudal\nchief, as the ideal knight of romantic story his lady, — in the\nspirit of all the loyal” (Royce 1908 [1995, 47]). These\nparticular examples are meant to illustrate the essentially social\ncharacter of loyalty in general: “My life means nothing, either\ntheoretically or practically, unless I am a member of a\ncommunity” (Royce 1913 [2001, 357]). \nOne of the more striking features of Royce’s philosophy is its\nemphasis on communities as being logically prior to individuals. As we\nhave seen, Royce considers the notions of truth and knowledge\nunintelligible for the individual unless we posit an ultimate knower\nof objective truth, the infinite community of minds. The notions of\npersonal identity and purpose are likewise unintelligible unless we\nposit a community of persons that defines causes and establishes\nsocial roles for those individuals to embrace. The concept of\ncommunity is thus central both to Royce’s ethics and his\nmetaphysics. Not just any association or collection of individuals is\na community. Community can only exist where individual members are in\ncommunication with one another so that there is, to some extent and in\nsome relevant respect, a congruence of feeling, thought, and will\namong them. It is also necessary to consider the temporal dimensions\nof community. “A community constituted by the fact that each of\nits members accepts as a part of his own individual life and self the\nsame past events that each of his fellow-members accepts, may\nbe called a community of memory.” Similarly, “A\ncommunity constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as\npart of his own individual life and self, the same expected\nfuture events that each of his fellows accepts, may be called\na community of expectation or…a community of\nhope” (PC 248). These common past and future events, which\nall members hold as identical parts of their own lives, are the basis\nof their loyalty to the community. \nAs discussed in connection with Royce’s ethical theory, some\ncommunities are defined by true loyalty, or adherence to a cause that\nharmonizes with the universal ideal of “loyalty to\nloyalty.” He refers to such communities as “genuine\ncommunities” or “communities of grace.” Other\ncommunities are defined by a vicious or predatory loyalty. These\ndegenerate “natural communities” tend toward the\ndestruction of others’ causes and possibilities of loyalty.\nFinally, beyond the actual communities that we directly encounter in\nlife there is the ideal “Beloved Community” of all those\nwho would be fully dedicated to the cause of loyalty, truth and\nreality itself. \nRoyce stresses that the sharing of individuals’ feelings,\nthoughts, and wills that occurs in any community (including the\nBeloved Community) should not be taken to imply a mystical blurring or\nannihilation of personal identities. Individuals remain individuals,\nbut in forming a community they attain to a kind of second-order life\nthat extends beyond any of their individual lives. Where a number of\nindividuals’ loyalty to a cause is coordinated in community over\ntime, Royce speaks non-figuratively of a super-human personality at\nwork: a genuine community is united by a guiding or\n“interpreting spirit.” The interpreting spirit may on\noccasion be embodied by a single person such as a leader or other\nexemplar, but this is not always the case. \nThough his writings contain a great deal of insight that is relevant\nfor a strictly naturalistic philosophy, religious concerns figure\nprominently from Royce’s first major publication, The\nReligious Aspect of Philosophy, to his last two, The Sources\nof Religious Insight and The Problem of Christianity. As\nhas been indicated, the main focus of Royce’s early work was\nmetaphysical. In The World and the Individual he plainly\nidentified the object of his inquiry as “the Individual of\nIndividuals, namely the Absolute, or God himself” (Royce\n1899–1901, 1:40). Critics of Royce’s early works admired\nhis metaphysical argumentation but found his conception of God\nwanting. Peirce observed that the Absolute Mind bore little\nresemblance to the God that people seek in churches — it is not\nthe kind of being anyone would worship. James objected that if all our\nerrors and sorrows are in fact reconciled in the Absolute, then finite\npersons would seem to be exonerated from ultimate responsibility for\ntheir actions: they might as well enjoy a lifelong “moral\nholiday.” With The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce began to\ndevote more attention to the practical questions of ethics and the\nphilosophy of community. In his last works he drew upon the notion of\nloyalty to explain the nature of religious experience in human\ncommunities. \nRoyce states that “the central and essential postulate” of\nevery religion is that “man needs to be saved” (Royce 1912\n[2001, 8–9]). Salvation is necessary because of a combination of\ntwo factors. The first is “the idea that there is some aim or\nend of human life which is more important than all other aims.”\nThe second is that “man as he now is, or as he naturally is, is\nin great danger of so missing this highest aim as to render his whole\nlife a senseless failure” (Royce 1912 [2001, 12]). Salvation\ncomes in the form of guidance toward understanding and accomplishing\nthe highest aim of life, so far as we are able. Given the limitations\nand fallibility of the human perspective, Royce maintains that this\nguidance must come from some super-human or divine source. Religion is\nthe sphere of life in which finite human beings are able to get into\ntouch with this divine source of wisdom and guidance. \nIn The Sources of Religious Insight Royce considers and\nrejects several common conceptions of religion before making his case\nfor a religion of loyalty. His discussion of natural social\nlife as a source of religious insight may be read as a critique\nof the “Social Gospel” movement. His consideration of\nreason is notable not for its familiar observation that\nreason is inadequate to religious knowledge, but for his pragmatist\ncritique of the adequacy of mere reason even for scientific knowledge.\nFinally, his careful consideration and rejection of\nindividualism in religion is a direct critique of the\nJamesean view of religious experience. Royce employs his familiar\ndialectical method to make his case for religious insight through\nparticipation in the loyal community, the “invisible\nchurch” guided by a divine spirit and devoted to the highest\nideals of goodness. In the Sources Royce offers a view of\nreligion as common experience. It is “common” both in the\nsense that it does not primarily consist of the kind of extraordinary\nexperiences that James emphasized, and in the sense that it is a\nfundamentally social rather than individual experience of reality. \nWhile the Sources concerns the nature of religious experience\nin general, The Problem of Christianity focuses on the\nquestion “In what sense, if any, can the modern man consistently\nbe, in creed, a Christian?” (Royce 1913 [2001, 62]).\nRoyce’s answer actually rejects the sort of static concepts and\nbeliefs usually implied by devotion to specific creeds, including\nthose identified with Christianity. While his view pivots on the\nChristian notion of divine incarnation, it is not the incarnation of\nGod in Jesus but rather the incarnation of the Spirit in the living\nchurch that Royce emphasizes: “the Church, rather than the\nperson of the founder, ought to be viewed as the central idea of\nChristianity” (Royce 1913 [2001, 43]). The Christian\nchurch’s primary importance, for Royce, is as a paradigm of\ncommunity. He regards the Pauline church as the best exemplar of a\ngraced community: at its best, the church strives to embody the\nguiding Interpreter Spirit, so as to become a Universal Community of\nInterpretation “whose life comprises and unifies all the social\nvarieties and all the social communities which…we know to be\nreal” (Royce 1913 [2001, 340]). Doctrines and creeds may change;\nthe particular institutions that identify themselves as churches may\nor may not actually be communities of grace. What matters in the end\nis the process of interpretation — the process of communicating\nand understanding one another in actual, imperfect, finite communities\nof grace bound together by loyalty and striving toward the ultimate\nand ideal Beloved Community. \nRoyce is critical of many historical churches because they have in his\nview lost sight of the spirit that ought to guide them. At the same\ntime he would identify grace at work in many communities that are not\nself-consciously religious. He had great respect for non-Christian\nreligions, paying especially careful attention to Buddhism (Royce took\nthe trouble to learn Sanskrit, and The Problem of\nChristianity includes a very sympathetic presentation of\nBuddhism). In the end, however, Royce was a philosopher who worked\nwithin the intellectual context of Western Christianity. He maintains\nthat only the Christian model of the loyal community successfully\ncombines the true spirit of universal interpretation with an\nappreciation of the “infinite worth” of the individual as\na unique member of the ideal Beloved Community, the Kingdom of Heaven\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 193]). \nThe problem of evil is a persistent theme throughout Royce’s\nwritings. He struggled with tragedy in his personal life and sought to\nunderstand it better through philosophy. As an idealist he also had to\nstruggle with evil as a problem of metaphysics. Idealism maintains\nthat all deeds and events are ultimately taken up and reconciled in a\nfinal perspective. This seems to suggest that the evil, sorrow, and\npain that run through human life are illusory — or what seems\neven less comprehensible, that our experience of suffering is somehow\ngood, that it is “all for the best.” While some idealists\nhave accepted these apparent implications of their metaphysics, Royce\nmaintained that evil is a real fact of the world. He insisted that we\nconfront evil as evil and not regard it as a means to attain\na preordained but inscrutable Divine purpose. He sought to understand\nevil philosophically. In seeking that understanding he was not content\nto explain it away or to salve its effects by appealing to a clever\ntheodicy. \nRoyce embraced a theistic process metaphysics that recognizes evil as\na real force and suffering as an irreducible fact of experience. In\n“The Problem of Job” Royce addressed the traditional\nproblem of evil: “Grant Job’s own presupposition that God\nis a being other than this world, that he is its external creator and\nruler, and then all solutions fail. God is either then cruel or\nhelpless, as regards all finite ill of the sort that Job\nendures.” If we consider that God is not a separate being, then\n“When you suffer, your sufferings are God’s\nsufferings, not his external work, not his external penalty, not the\nfruit of his neglect, but identically his own personal woe. In you God\nhimself suffers, precisely as you do, and has all your concern in\novercoming this grief.” Grief is not “a physical means to\nan external end,” but rather “a logically necessary and\neternal constituent of the divine life” (McDermott 1969, 843).\nThough Royce believed that events are collectively tending toward an\nultimate reconciliation in the eternal perspective of the Beloved\nCommunity, they are not erased even in that ideal perspective. The\nevents of life (joyful and sorrowful alike) persist, both as\nexperiences of the individuals who undergo them and also as\nGod’s own experiences. \nRoyce does not seek to explain away or lessen the reality of evil: it\nis in his view a brute fact of being, an inevitable result of the\nworld’s existence in time. Given the fact of evil, the most\nimportant question concerns how we finite beings ought to respond to\nit. His answer is that we should adopt the attitude of loyalty to\ngoodness and truth, which as real forces in the world are the\nmetaphysical opposite of evil. The loyal member of a genuine community\nconfronts evil and wills to overcome it through the very fact of\nloyalty to its opposite. Evil can never be eradicated — this is\nanother way of saying that loyalty to loyalty is a lost cause. Though\nthe success of this high cause lies in the unreachable\nfuture, the meaning of our response is manifest in our\npresent lives. \nRoyce’s powerful and original explanation of the doctrine of\natonement in The Problem of Christianity details how the\nloyal community can best respond to human evil. The highest kind of\ntransgression in an ethics of loyalty is treason, or the willful\nbetrayal of one’s own cause and the community of people who\nserve it. The traitor is one who has freely embraced a cause and\njoined with a community of grace in service of that cause, but who\nthen culpably commits some act that undermines the cause and the\ncommunity. Such a betrayal is but one step away from moral suicide: it\nthreatens to destroy the network of purposes and concrete social\nrelationships that define the traitor’s self (Royce 1913 [2001,\n162]). Atonement occurs when the traitor and the community are\nreconciled, when they are both saved from the evil deed through some\nact of the will. \nRoyce finds traditional Christian accounts of atonement\nunsatisfactory. They do not adequately explain how both the traitor\nand the community are reconciled and saved in the human sphere. Much\nless do they explain the mysterious details of how atonement\nreconciles the sinner with God. The traitor who recognizes the\nmagnitude of what has been lost through the act of betrayal lives in a\nstate that Royce calls “the hell of the irrevocable”\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 162]). Royce seeks an explanation of atonement that\nacknowledges the irrevocable nature of a deed that has been done, and\nwhich changes everything for the sinner and the community that has\nbeen harmed. “Penal satisfaction” theories of atonement\nsimply do not speak to the sinner’s situation: to be told that\nan angry God demands repayment or retribution for the betrayal, and\nthat this price has been paid (by the violent death of Jesus Christ,\nor by any other sacrifice) does not repair the sinner’s own\ndevastated moral universe. The sinner “is dealing, not with the\n‘angry God’ of a well-known theological tradition, but\nwith himself” (Royce 1913 [2001, 170–71]). Royce seeks a\ntheory that first makes sense of the immediate human aspect of\natonement. If one can be found, it may then be considered\ntheologically. A theory of “penal satisfaction,” which\nclaims to answer theological questions but remains meaningless or\nmysterious in human terms, is simply unsatisfactory. \nThe concrete human evil of treason is that the traitor’s loyalty\nto the cause, and with it the moral relations that bound the community\ntogether, have been broken and cannot be restored to their previous\nstate. “Moral theories” of atonement account for change in\nthe traitor’s person but fail to explain how the “wounded\nor shattered community” can be repaired (Royce 1913 [2001,\n175]). Such theories, in Royce’s account, explain that in\ncontemplating Christ’s willing sacrifice of his own life for the\nsake of the human community, the sinner experiences deep repentance\nand develops a new capacity for love of the betrayed community. The\nsinner’s soul is purified and made better (Royce 1913 [2001,\n172]). Such a process may bring the sinner to realize the hellish\nmagnitude of irrevocable treason. Royce points out, though, that such\na process by itself does nothing to reconcile the sinner to the\ncommunity or to repair that community. Such reconciliation and healing\nrequires something more than a change in the individual’s\nheart. \nThis brings Royce to consider theories of atonement that center upon\nthe community’s act of forgiveness. Forgiveness, as an act of\nthe community and not the sinner, is clearly essential to atonement.\nMoreover, it involves a recognition of human frailty — not just\nthe moral frailty of the sinner in question, but that of all humans.\nForgiveness involves a recognition that anyone might commit such an\nact, that the cause of perfect loyalty is a lost cause. Even when it\ncan occur, though, forgiveness does not restore the community to the\ninnocent state of harmony and “unscarred love” that\nexisted before the betrayal (Royce 1913 [2001, 177–78]).\nAtonement moves the community and the traitor beyond the irrevocable\ndeed of betrayal. This cannot be done by an act of forgiveness that\nreturns the community and its relations to the way things were before.\n“The way things were” is irrevocably gone. \nIn its human aspect atonement occurs through an interpretive act that\ncreates new relationships among the members, including the traitor,\ntogether with a new understanding and fresh embracing of their\nunifying cause. The act of atonement “can only be accomplished\nby the community, or on behalf of the community, through some\nsteadfastly loyal servant who acts, so to speak, as the incarnation of\nthe spirit of the community itself” (Royce 1913 [2001, 180]).\nThis person acts as a mediating third party between the traitor and\nthe betrayed community. Things are not made the same as they were\nbefore through atonement, but are in an important respect made better\n— precisely because of the unique circumstances created by the\noriginal act of treason. Through the atoning act genuine community is\nrestored and all the individuals involved may emerge as wiser, more\nresolved servants of their common cause. In this sense, Royce writes,\n“The world, as transformed by this creative deed, is better\nthan it would have been had all else remained the same, but had that\ndeed of treason not been done at all” (Royce 1913 [2001,\n180]). \nRoyce indicates that this insight about the human aspect of atonement\nprovides the basis for a theological understanding of the atonement\ninvolved in Christ’s teachings and death. He does not himself\narticulate the details of a theological doctrine of atonement,\nhowever. He states “the central postulate” of “the\nhighest form of human spirituality” as follows: “No\nbaseness or cruelty of treason so deep or so tragic shall enter our\nhuman world, but that loyal love shall be able in due time to oppose\nto just that deed of treason its fitting deed of atonement”\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 186]). This postulate cannot be proved true, of\ncourse, but human communities can assert it and act upon it as if it\nwere true. Christian doctrine, as Royce presents it, takes this same\npostulate as “a report concerning the supernatural works of\nChrist” (Royce 1913 [2001, 186]). In The Problem of\nChristianity Royce had set out to answer the question “In\nwhat sense, if any, can the modern man consistently be, in creed, a\nChristian?” One form of his answer, based on this theory of\natonement, is that communities can and should act upon the faith that,\nthrough the spirit of genuine community, atonement is always possible\nas a response to human sin and evil. \nRoyce understood logic as the science of order focused on\n“problems regarding, not the methods by which a thinker\nsucceeds, nor yet the norms, but rather the Forms, the\nCategories, the Types of Order, which characterize\nany realm of objects” (Royce 1913a, 69). In a variety of work\nbeginning with The World and The Individual (1900) continuing\nthrough the remainder of his life in published and unpublished papers,\nRoyce proposed a logical system with both formal and informal,\nphilosophical implications. He called his logic “System\n\\(\\Sigma\\).” \nThe logic of \\(\\Sigma\\) begins, according to Royce, with the ontological\nclaim that the terms of the logic “may be defined as,\n‘certain possible modes of action that are open to any rational\nbeing who can act at all, and who can also reflect upon his own modes\nof possible action’ ” (1913a,\n 130–1).[1] \nHence the subject matter\nof logic is “objects” understood not as fixed entities but\nas “modes of action.” Note that for Royce, a\n‘rational being’ is a purposive being: that is, an agent\nunderstood as something capable of action toward a purpose. In\nWorld and the Individual he writes: “At any moment your\nideas, in so far as they are rational, embody a purpose” (1900,\n441–2). “And so,” he says elsewhere, “the empirical\nworld is a whole, a life fulfilling the purposes of our ideas. It is\nthat or it is nothing” (1900, 368). The logic that Royce\nproposes is therefore a logic of action where actions are taken as\npurposive. \nAs an ontological starting point, modes of action should be understood\nas “general” terms, in the sense proposed by C. S.\nPeirce. Generals, for Peirce, are like habits in that they\nspecify a general state of affairs that can be realized in multiple\ndifferent ways (Peirce, 1931, 2:148). Generals stand in contrast\nto universals. While universals are deductively complete\ncategories, generals are emergent categories where some particulars fit\nclosely to the features specified by the general concept and others\nless so. The category of oak tree, for example, can be realized\nby a wide range of particular oak trees from tall, full trees, to\nsmall, stunted trees, to trees broken by ice and wind. Each is,\nin a general sense, an oak tree, but each realizes the concept in a\nparticular way. The concept of species is likewise general in\nthat a species includes marginal cases that are not clearly in the\ncategory or clearly out of it. While it is tempting (especially\nin the case of terms that are defined in a particular field of inquiry)\nto suppose that categories are the nominal constructs of inquirers,\nPeirce argued that generals are themselves real (not nominal), so that\nnatural kinds or categories are the products of evolving and\nintersecting activities, and as such are as much discovered as they are\ncreated for purposes of inquiry (Peirce, 8:12; Mayorga,\n2007).  \nModes of action are similarly general. Talk about the relation\nbetween actions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is talk about the relation between two general\nways of acting. When \\(A\\) is actually taken, then it is a particular\ntoken of the type of action \\(A\\) and it stands in a distinctive relation\nwith other modes of action with which it is compatible and still other\nmodes of action with which it is not. By framing his logic as a\nlogic of modes of action, Royce can include both categories of commonly\nunderstood actions (walking, talking, reading, judging), but is also\nable to include any sort of persistent being by seeing a being as a\nprocess involving distinctive characteristic actions in relation to\ngeneral categories or modes of action. An apple is a thing that\nacts like an apple; a mountain is a thing that acts like a mountain; a\nfine pinot noir is thing that acts like a fine pinot noir. The\npower of this approach is that the objects of logic are necessarily\nunderstood as ongoing activities that both close off possibilities and\nopen new ones with each action. \n\nThe primary operation in Royce’s logic is the\nexclusive \ndisjunction[2], \n an operation or possible operation that\ndivides actions into two “obverse” or incompatible\ncategories where if one action from a category is taken, it eliminates\nthe possibility of taking an action in the other.  For example, an\nexclusive disjunction is present when an agent selects a candidate on\na ballot. To select the candidate is to lose the option to choose\nanother or to simply opt out of voting. Put another way, actions are\nexclusively related when they are incompatible, that is, they cannot\nbe taken together. Royce’s logic is founded on the relation that\nexpresses the operation of judgment, that is, the selection by an\nagent of one alternative over another where the alternatives are\nincompatible. System \\(\\Sigma\\) is a logic of modes of action and a\nlogic of agency. \nExclusively-related actions also introduce the operation of\nnegation. When an action is negated, it\nis not taken (or is excluded from the possibility of being\ntaken). So, if action \\(A\\) and action \\(B\\) are related by exclusive\ndisjunction, then if action \\(A\\) is taken, action \\(B\\) is negated,\n\\(\\neg B\\).  \nThe exclusive relation that holds between incompatible actions also\nprovides a context for Royce’s notion of\nequivalence (Royce 1905, 391).  An action, \\(A\\), is\nlogically equivalent to another action, \\(B\\), if and only if they are\ncompatible (one can be taken without excluding the other). So, for\nexample, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are compatible and \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\)\nare incompatible, then \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg B\\) are also incompatible. If\nso, then \\(A = B\\). In the case of voting just mentioned, the\nthree-term relation (voting for candidate \\(M\\), voting for someone else,\nand not voting at all) are together incompatible.  If we consider the\nfirst option, voting for \\(M\\), then the other two options are equivalent\nbecause they equally eliminate voting for \\(M\\) if one or the other is\ntaken. Equivalence then is relative to compatibility in a given\nsituation defined by a set of incompatible or “obverse”\npossibilities.  \nExclusive disjunction and equivalence suggest two other basic\nrelations among actions: symmetry and asymmetry (Royce 1905,\n379–385; 1913a, 97–100). Exclusive disjunctions are\nsymmetrical in that their order in relation to the disjunctive terms\ndoes not matter. That is, if \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is an exclusive\ndisjunction, then \\(\\neg A\\) or \\(A\\) is also.  Equivalence is also\nsymmetrical in that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equivalent, then \\(B\\) and\n\\(A\\) are also equivalent. In either case, the actions are not ordered\nwith respect to each other. When actions are ordered such that \\(A\\)\nis antecedent to \\(B\\) (or vice versa), then the relation is\nasymmetrical.  \nIn general, the process of ordering is a twofold\ntransformation. Possibilities of action emerge as symmetrical\nexclusive disjunctions and are transformed into asymmetrical relations\nsuch that one action is antecedent to the other. If \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is an\nexclusive disjunction, then taking action \\(A\\) results in the negation of\naction \\(B\\), such that \\(\\neg B\\) is a consequence of the antecedent taking\nof \\(A\\). The symmetrical exclusive disjunction is transformed by the\naction of an agent into the asymmetrical antecedent/consequent\nrelation. \n\nGiven exclusive disjunction, equivalence, symmetry, and asymmetry,\nRoyce proposed that such relations could be expressed as a single\nordering relation, the obverse or\n\\(O\\)-relation.[3] \nRepresented ‘\\(O(A \\: B)\\)’, the \\(O\\)-relation marks two\npossible courses or modes of action, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and indicates\nthat these courses of action are incompatible: that is, \\(O(A\\: B)\\)\ncan be read as the assertion that action A and action B cannot both be\ntaken or that if \\(A\\) is taken \\(B\\) cannot be taken and vice\nversa. \\(O\\)-relations simultaneously represent a state of affairs\nsuch that two possible courses of action are available, one of which\ncan be actualized and the other excluded. \\(O\\)-relations are also\nsuch that, in the course of things, one of the disjuncts must be\ntaken. If \\(O(A\\: B)\\), then it is also the case that\n“neither” is not an option in just the way that\n“neither” is not an option for \\(O(A \\: \\neg A)\\). The\n\\(O\\)-relation can include as many terms as are, when taken together,\nincompatible and, regardless of the number of terms, they may still be\nreduced to the dyad \\(O(a \\:\\neg a)\\). Taken as a set of incompatible\nactions, \\(O(A \\: B)\\) is an \\(O\\)-collection (Royce 1905,\n390), as are \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) and \\(O(A\\: B\\: C\\: \\ldots \\: n)\\). Now\nif \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incompatible (and so then are \\(\\neg A\\) and\n\\(\\neg B\\)), it is also the case that \\(\\neg A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ncompatible as are \\(\\neg B\\) and \\(A\\). These terms are then related\nby the compatibility relation, equivalence, or the \\(E\\)-relation\n(Royce 1905, 390–391) such that \\(E(\\neg A\\: B)\\) and \\(E(A \\:\\neg\nB)\\). \nRoyce summarized the central ontological claims of his system this\nway: “whatever else the world contains, if it only contains a\nreasonable being who knows and intends his own acts, then this being\nis aware of a certain relation, the relation between performing and\nnot performing any act which he considers in advance of action. And\nthus relations amongst acts are in such wise necessary facts, that\nwhoever acts at all, or whoever, even in ideal, contemplates\npossible courses of action, must regard at least some of\nthese relations as present in the realm of his conceived modes of\naction” (1913a, 120–1.  When Royce introduced the\nformal system \\(\\Sigma\\) in his 1905 paper, “The Relation of the\nPrinciples of Logic to the Foundations of Geometry,” he proposed\nsix “laws” to which \\(O\\)-collections must\nconform. Restated, these six laws are as follows: \nThe six laws are offered by Royce as postulates, but they are\nintended to provide both relational and ontological parameters for\nordering. The first two laws establish the existence of exclusive\ndisjunctions which are necessary for a world in which there are\nagents. Laws three and four establish that the universe is such\nthat it includes a principle of generation or emergence—there is\nat least one thing, and if there is one thing there are infinitely\nmany\n more.[5]\nThe\nfifth and sixth laws stipulate the constraints on emergent\nactions. The fifth law establishes paradoxical objects that,\nwhile compatible with two different incompatible objects, are not\ncompatible with these objects when taken together. Likewise, the\nsixth law established that \\(O\\)-collections also generate new objects or\nterms that extend the possibilities included in a given\nO-collection. The six laws provide the generative landscape in\nwhich agents emerge and operate. They also reinforce the idea\nthat agency is predicated on both selecting possibilities and losing\nthem permanently so that agency, whatever else it involves, entails\nboth opportunity and\n sacrifice.[6] \nSystem \\(\\Sigma\\) then is the process of transforming symmetrically\nrelated possibilities to asymmetrical ordered action through the\nnegation of some possible action(s). In most general terms, this\nallows us to think of \\(O\\)-relations as modal and conditional. If the\n\\(O\\)-relation holds of actions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then it is the case\nthat if \\(A\\) is negated (not taken or sacrificed) then \\(B\\)\nfollows. Rather than being a material conditional \\((\\neg A \\supset\nB)\\), the antecedent and consequent are necessarily related. If\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\) then \\(\\Box (A \\supset \\neg B)\\) and \\(\\Box (\\neg A\n\\supset B)\\).[7]\nConsequently, the dyadic \\(O\\)-relation, \\(O(A\\: B)\\) can also be\nrepresented as \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\) and so as \\(\\Box (A \\supset\n\\neg B) \\wedge \\Box (B \\supset \\neg A)\\). Given the equivalence\nrelation, it follows that \\(B\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg A\\) and so can\nbe substituted for \\(B\\) so that \\(O(A\\: \\neg A)\\) and \\(\\Box (A\n\\equiv \\neg \\neg A)\\). \\(O\\)-relations, however, are not limited to\ndyadic relations. Consider three possible courses of action such that\ntaking any one requires the elimination of the other two courses of\naction (for example, selecting one of three paths at a fork in the\nroad). This situation can be represented as \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\). Note\nthat if \\(A\\) is taken, then neither \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) can be taken so\nthat together, \\((B \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg A\\). Likewise,\nif \\(B\\) is taken, then \\((A \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg B\\) and\nso on. So \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) is also \nHowever, since the fifth law allows that every pair of incompatible\nactions generates a third term making the initial dyadic \\(O\\)-relation a\ntriadic \\(O\\)-relation, conditional relations require an additional\nrelation that represents both the compatibility of the resulting terms\nand the asymmetrical order created. Royce proposes the F-relation\nfor this purpose. An \\(F\\)-relation (like the\nsymmetrical \\(E\\)-relation) represents the terms of the original \\(O\\)-relation\nmodified so that they are\n compatible.[8] \nIt also adds an additional symbol (the\nvertical stroke) to mark the place of the antecedent term that makes\nthe \\(F\\)-relation\n asymmetrical.[9] \nConsider \\(O(a\\: b)\\) By the fifth law, \\(O(a\\: b)\\) adds a third\nterm, \\(c\\), which is at once compatible with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (that\nis, \\(E(a\\: c)\\) and \\(E(b\\: c)\\)) and taken together with \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) form \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\).  This third element, following the work\nof A.B. Kempe (1890), is “between” \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Royce\n(like Kempe) captures this betweenness by requiring that the new third\nterm be compatible with both terms but not reducible to them. In\neffect, the fifth law says that whenever two actions are incompatible,\nthere exists an action “between” the two that can, with a\ncorrect transformation, order the obverse actions. Using Royce’s\nillustration, Figure 1 represents \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\) where \\(c\\) is\ncompatible with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the region where all three fields\noverlap, there are no elements. Figure 2 represents \\( F(\\neg c | a\\:\nb )\\) where the region \\(\\neg c\\) overlaps, and so is compatible with,\nregions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \nFigure 1. \\(O (a\\: b\\: c)\\)\n \nFigure 2. \\(F (\\neg c | a\\: b)\\) \n  \nAs Royce explains, “The \\(F\\)-relation, so long as\n‘obverses’ or ‘negatives’ exist, follows\nimmediately from, and is equivalent to, an \\(O\\)-relation. For, in the\ndiagram [above] if \\(s\\) is the total surface in which \\(a\\), \\(b\\),\nand \\(c\\) are included, then when ‘\\(c\\) is between \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\),’ ‘\\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\neg c\\) (\\(\\neg c\\) being\nthe obverse of \\(c\\)) constitute an \\(O\\)-collection,’ or\n‘are in the \\(O\\)-relation’ ” (Royce 1905,\n387).  \nThe \\(O\\)-relation is transformed into an \\(F\\)-relation by negating\none of the three terms, selecting one term as the antecedent\nand another term as the “origin.” This is written\nas \\(F (\\neg A | B\\: C)\\), where the term to the left of the vertical\nstroke is the antecedent, and the two remaining terms are the\nconsequent and the action “in terms of which” the\nantecedent and consequent are so ordered. The expression can be read:\nIf \\(A\\) is not taken then \\(B\\) follows with respect to \\(C\\).\n“It is this origin, [\\(C\\)],” Royce observes, “which\ngives ‘sense’ to the pair [\\(A\\: B\\)] in the expression\n[\\(A \\supset B\\) with respect to \\(C\\)]” (1905, 407).  \nWhile \\(O\\)-relations are indeterminate as to outcome, since the terms\nare symmetrically related, F-relations mark the selection of possible\ncourses of action and so establish the linear, asymmetrical relations\nof agential action. Royce concludes: “Wherever a linear series\nis in question, wherever an origin of coordinates is employed,\nwherever ‘cause and effect,’ ‘ground and\nconsequence,’ orientation in space or direction of tendency in\ntime are in question, the dyadic asymmetrical relations involved are\nessentially the same as the relation here symbolized by [\\(p \\supset\nq\\) with respect to \\(y\\)]” (1905, 407).  \nThe conditionals that result from the initial \\(O\\)-collection include\n\\(\\neg A \\supset B\\) with respect to \\(C\\), \\(\\neg B \\supset A\\) with\nrespect to \\(C\\), \\(\\neg C \\supset A\\) with respect to \\(B\\), and so\non. Since \\(O\\)-relations are symmetrical, there are as many\nalternative “courses” of action as there are possibilities\nof negation and selection of antecedents and origins. Since the\nconditionals are possibilities, they could also be represented\n“\\(\\Diamond (\\neg C \\supset B)\\), \\(A\\)” where \\(A\\) represents a\nshared propositional \nparameter.[10] \n“It is now possible,” Royce\nconcludes, “to point out that the elements of \\(\\Sigma\\) possess\nthe properties of a system of logical classes, or of entities to which\nthe ordinary algebra of logic applies” (1905, 427). The\nresulting conditionals operate in a system that is like a relevant\npossible world logic were the truth of the conditional is dependent on\nits truth assignment through the propositional parameter that orders\nantecedent and consequent. However, Royce cautions against reliance on\nlogics that are primarily interested in conditional relations. Such\ninterest is a result of our “intellectual habits” but\n“in several respects inferior to the more direct expression in\nterms of \\(O\\)-relations. … When, in fact, we attempt to\ndescribe the relations of the system \\(\\Sigma\\) merely in terms of the\nantecedent-consequent relation, we not only limit ourselves to an\narbitrary choice of origin, but miss the power to survey at a glance\nrelations of more than a dyadic, or triadic character”\n(381–2).  \n\nAs an idealist philosopher, Royce entered the study of logic (with\nother idealists of his time) interested in the operations of the will\nand the formalization of judgment. The central operation in\njudgment is the selection of one alternative and the rejection of\nothers. In the debates about the central logical operations that\nemerged in the 1890s and early 20th century, realist\nphilosophers argued against founding logic on the basic relation that\nemerges in judgments. Rather, they argued in favor of using the\ninclusive disjunction as the starting point. The reason given for\nthis alternative was that the inclusive disjunction provided a better\nmodel for the logic of burgeoning empirical science in two ways. \nFirst, it began with objects already in existence that can be put in\nrelation to other already existing objects. Second, the exclusive\ndisjunction requires the recognition of objects that do not exist in\nthe ordinary sense (negated objects, for example). When the\ndebates ended with the start of World War One, the realist logicians\nheld the field and Royce’s alternative (and the work of other\nidealist logicians) faded from view. \nRoyce’s development of system \\(\\Sigma\\) occurred before modal\nlogic was formalized. While Royce uses the language of necessity and\npossibility in his discussion of logic, his system has no formal place\nfor it. In fact, his student, C. I. Lewis, seeing the need to account\nfor modal operators in understanding the conditionals of logic,\nproposed the first modal system in 1918, two years after Royce’s\ndeath. Lewis’s introduction of the strict conditional as a means\nof correcting Russell and Whitehead’s material conditional\nsystem required the introduction of modal operators to serve, in\neffect, as the parameter needed to connect the antecedent and\nconsequent of conditionals (Pratt 2007). \nRoyce’s project was framed as one fundamentally concerned with\naction as he observed in a 1906 paper. “[T]he fundamental\nlogical relations,” he wrote, “are characteristic not only\nof our world of thought, but also of our world of action. For\nwill-acts involve acceptance and refusal, affirmation and negation, a\nconsciousness of consequences, a facing of alternatives, a union of\nvarious acts in one act; so that the logic of action is in form\nprecisely the same as the logic of abstract thought” (1906,\n100). From this perspective, Royce observed in an unpublished lecture\nfrom 1905, “There is a fundamental relation which may be called\nthe logical relation par excellence. It is the relation between\n‘yes’ and ‘no’, the relation which\ncharacterizes two mutually exclusive alternatives, that together\nexhaust all the possibilities. It is the relation that one faces, when\none has a choice to make. It is also the relation that obtains between\nany logical class and the negative of that class” (1905a,\n6). The \\(O\\)-relation then marks both necessity and possibility (that\nis, it marks a necessary relation between ‘yes’ and\n‘no’ and it exhausts the possibilities). As I observed\nearlier, the \\(O\\)-relation can be captured in modern modal logic by\nrepresenting it as the conjunction of two conditionals such that\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\) is \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\). Although not founded as a\nmodal logic, system \\(\\Sigma\\) is modal in its operations and so\npotentially formalizable in modal terms.  \n\nRoyce was deeply interested in the developing theories of logic,\nmathematics, and geometry in the 1890s and early 1900s. While he had a\nlifelong interest in logic and mathematics, it was not until 1898, when\nhe attended a series of lectures by C. S. Peirce titled Reasoning\nand the Logic of Things (1898 [1992]), that he undertook a thorough study\nof the work of Cantor, Dedekind, Klein, Cayley and Kempe. Royce\nregarded Peirce’s lectures as “epoch marking,” as he\nnotes in a letter to James (1970, 422), in part because new\nmathematical theory gave him a way to address a central criticism of\nhis metaphysics. \nIn the years immediately prior to the Peirce lectures, Royce’s\nmetaphysical views had been sharply criticized on the grounds that his\nconcept of the Absolute had made individuals unreal, subsumed by the\nwhole (Howison in Royce 1897, 98–9). Royce countered the\ncriticism, by arguing that the Absolute was a system that was composed\nof real individuals (2000, 297, 314–5). Royce, however, was\nunable to provide a compelling formal argument for the possibility of\na system in which the parts of a whole could also be distinct, a\nview rejected with a well-known argument of F. H. Bradley (Royce 1959,\n477–485).  Peirce’s 1898 lecture included a case for his\nthen-current conception of continuity (he proposed several) in which\nthe unified whole was a logical consequence of a universe of discrete\nindividuals (Moore 2007), that is, where “we have now reached a\nmultitude so vast that the individuals of such a collection melt into\none another and lose their distinct identities” (Peirce 1898 [1992,\n159]). In making his case, Peirce called on resources from Boole,\nCantor, Dedekind and Kempe among others. By 1900, Royce offered his\nown version of continuity, the concept of an infinite,\nself-representative system.  Published as a lengthy\n“supplementary essay” to The World and\nIndividual, First Series, and framed as an answer to Bradley,\nRoyce aimed to provide a proof that a single infinite system could\ncontain multitudes of distinct individuals. \nBy 1901, Royce had begun to reframe his metaphysics in terms of the\nErlanger Programm, devised by Klein (1893) as a means of\nclassifying different geometries by identifying what is invariant\nacross transformations in each system. Klein demonstrated that the\ninvariants of projective geometry could be captured in a set of\npostulates that would also hold for Euclidean and other non-Euclidean\ngeometries each of which included the invariants of projective geometry\nand additional invariants (Bell, 1940, 442–448). Royce argued that\nKempe’s system, and Royce’s own System \\(\\Sigma\\), were defined by\nabstract postulates that would be necessary for any system of order\nwhatever including projective geometry. In unpublished notes from 1901,\nRoyce explicitly attributes the source of his discussion to the\nErlanger Programm and argues that invariants of the sort\nidentified by Kempe are illustrated in projective geometry,\n“just” land transactions, “Kant’s moral\nworld,” musical performance, and selves. For Royce, the\ninvariants of geometry and so findings based upon their analysis could\ndirectly inform the analysis of other ordering processes (1901,\n96–110). \nThe publication of “The Relation of the Principles of Logic to\nthe Foundations of Geometry” (1905) and “An Extension of\nthe Algebra of Logic” (1913b) were significant works of pure\nmathematics but were also intended to illustrate invariants across\ntransformations of all sorts. Burch (2011) has left open the question\nof how Royce’s work in mathematical logic is related to his\ngeneral philosophical project, but has argued that Royce nevertheless\nmade a significant contribution to mathematical logic by developing\nthe concept of a Boolean Ring and an algebra identical to the system\ndevised at about the same time by Russian logician, Ivan Ivanovich\nZhegalkin, renowned as “the ‘father’ of the Russian\nschool of logic” (231). Central to the Boolean Ring operations and to\nthe larger System \\(\\Sigma\\) is Royce’s development of the\noperation of symmetric difference (discussed elsewhere as the\n\\(O\\)-relation), which is also viewed as one of Royce’s major\ncontributions by later reviewers, Burton and Leblanc (1952). While\nBurch suggests the possibility of a full exposition of System\n\\(\\Sigma\\), apart from Royce’s own there is currently no such\ntreatment available. Burch also discusses Royce’s work in\nphilosophical logic in the introduction to a paper by Royce addressing\nRussell’s paradox as presented in Russell’s 1903 The\nPrinciples of Logic. This paper, Burch argues, both demonstrates\nRoyce’s familiarity with developments in modern logic at the\ntime and presents an alternative resolution of the paradox similar to\nFrege’s response while also offering a non-foundational set\ntheory (1987). Other important assessments of Royce’s work in\nmathematics and logic include early reviews by Sheffer (1908), De\nLaguna (1906), and C. I. Lewis (1916), and more recent assessments\nin papers by Crouch (2011) and Scanlan (2011).","contact.mail":"parkerk@gvsu.edu","contact.domain":"gvsu.edu"},{"date.published":"2004-08-03","date.changed":"2021-03-19","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/royce/","author1":"Kelly A.

W. F.\nHegel and F. H. Bradley) that all aspects of reality, including those\nwe experience as disconnected or contradictory, are ultimately unified\nin the thought of a single all-encompassing consciousness. Royce also\nmade original contributions in ethics, philosophy of community,\nphilosophy of religion and logic. His major works include The\nReligious Aspect of Philosophy (1885), The World and the\nIndividual (1899–1901), The Philosophy of Loyalty\n(1908), and The Problem of Christianity (1913). Royce’s\nfriendly but longstanding dispute with William James, known as\n“The Battle of the Absolute,” deeply influenced both\nphilosophers’ thought. In his later works, Royce reconceived his\nmetaphysics as an “absolute pragmatism” grounded in\nsemiotics. This view dispenses with the Absolute Mind of previous\nidealism and instead characterizes reality as a universe of ideas or\nsigns which occur in a process of being interpreted by an infinite\ncommunity of minds. These minds, and the community they constitute,\nmay themselves be understood as signs. Royce’s ethics,\nphilosophy of community, philosophy of religion, and logic reflect\nthis metaphysical position. \n\nRoyce was born November 20, 1855, in the remote mining town of Grass\nValley, California, to Josiah and Sarah Eleanor Bayliss Royce. Sarah\nRoyce was a devout Christian who headed a primary school in Grass\nValley. Royce’s mother and older sisters directed his early\neducation. At age 11 he entered school in San Francisco. He graduated\nfrom the newly established University of California in Oakland with a\nB. A. degree in Classics in 1875. Royce then traveled to Germany to\nstudy philosophy for one year, mastering the language and attending\nlectures in Heidelberg, Leipzig, and Göttingen. On his return, he\nentered the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where he\nearned a Ph. D. in 1878. \nHe taught composition and literature at the University of California,\nBerkeley from 1878–1882. During this time he published numerous\nphilosophical articles, as well as his Primer of Logical\nAnalysis. He married Katherine Head in 1880. The couple had three\nchildren (Christopher 1882; Edward 1886; Stephen 1889) and remained\nmarried until Josiah’s death. Not content in California, so far\nfrom the intellectual life of the East Coast, Royce sought help in\nattaining a new post from his acquaintances there. In his later\nethical writings Royce would stress the centrality of action intended\nto realize a sound ideal that one has freely embraced. When offered\nthe opportunity to replace William James during a one year sabbatical\nat Harvard University, Royce acted: he accepted the offer of half of\nJames’s salary, resigned his California appointment altogether,\nand moved his wife and newborn son across the continent in the summer\nof 1882. \nIn Cambridge, Royce commenced to work doggedly and in diverse areas.\nIn January 1883 he arrived at an insight that proved fundamental to\nhis philosophy: in order for our ordinary concepts of truth and error\nto be meaningful, there must be an Absolute Knower, an actual infinite\nmind that encompasses the totality of all actual truths and possible\nerrors. This insight formed the core of his first major philosophical\npublication, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy, which\nappeared in 1885. Royce received a permanent appointment as assistant\nprofessor at Harvard in that same year. (During his three decades at\nHarvard Royce would teach such notable students as T. S. Eliot, George\nSantayana, and W. E. B. Du Bois.) He taught full time, gave many\npublic lectures, published his History of California in 1886,\nand a novel in 1887. In 1888 he experienced a nervous breakdown, from\nwhich he recovered after a sea voyage of some months’\nduration. \nRoyce was appointed Professor of the History of Philosophy at Harvard\nin 1892 and served as Chair of the Department of Philosophy from\n1894–98. During these years Royce established himself as a\nleading figure in American academic philosophy with his many reviews,\nlectures and books, including The Spirit of Modern Philosophy\n(1892) and The Conception of God (1895). In 1898 Royce\nattended a series of lectures by Charles S. Peirce, “Reasoning\nand the Logic of Things,” which significantly influenced his\nunderstanding of the relation between logic and metaphysics. \nRoyce delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of\nAberdeen in two series, the first in 1899 and the second the following\nyear. He regarded this as the opportunity to consolidate his years of\nhard thought and study, so as to produce a definitive and original\nstatement of his metaphysics. The result was his two volume opus\nThe World and the Individual (1899–1901). \nThe Gifford Lectures marked a turning point in Royce’s life and\nthought. He had worked out his philosophical theories in minute\ndetail. His public reputation as a philosopher was sealed (Royce was\nelected president of the American Psychological Association in 1902\nand of the American Philosophical Association in 1903). The year 1900\napparently represented the culmination of his life’s work. Royce\nwas only 45 years old, though, and this culmination proved also to be\na starting point for significant growth. \nReviews of The World and the Individual praised Royce’s\nphilosophical acumen but raised significant objections to his\nconclusions. Peirce, in particular, pointedly criticized Royce’s\nuse of logic. Royce set out to reconsider his central arguments and,\nat the same time, undertook an ambitious program of study in\nmathematical logic. In his teaching and publications after 1900, two\nphilosophical strains came to the forefront. One was a growing\nreliance on formal logical and mathematical concepts as the basis for\nhis metaphysical speculation (the first hint of this appears in the\n“Supplementary Essay” to the first volume of The World\nand the Individual). The second was an emphasis on philosophy as\na means to understand the concrete phenomena of life: the nature of\nhuman society, of religious experience, of ethical action, of\nsuffering and the problem of evil. \nAfter 1907 Royce’s emphasis on the relevance of philosophy for\nliving took on a clear personal dimension. In that year Christopher,\nwho had come with Josiah and Katherine across the continent as a\nnewborn 25 years earlier, and who had graduated from Harvard at age\n18, showed symptoms of severe depression and psychotic delusions. In\n1908 his parents committed him to a state mental hospital with little\nhope that he would recover. In August of 1910 William James died,\nleaving Royce without his closest friend, neighbor and colleague. In\nSeptember of the same year Christopher Royce died of typhoid fever,\nleaving Josiah and Katherine without their firstborn child. Royce had\nearlier stated his philosophy in a somewhat abstract and formal way,\nso that it might help him discover metaphysical truth. Perhaps under\nthe weight of these later sorrows, Royce returned to his system\nseeking wisdom and understanding in addition to truth. \nHowever that may be, and though he by no means abandoned systematic\nand theoretical philosophy, Royce began to write more about what today\nwould be called “practical” or “applied”\nphilosophy. His major work on ethics, The Philosophy of\nLoyalty, appeared in 1908. Later he would address ethics in even\nmore practical terms, not as a philosophy but as an “art”\nof loyalty. He published a collection of essays under the title\nRace Questions, Provincialism, and Other American Problems in\n1908; another collection, entitled William James and Other Essays\non the Philosophy of Life, appeared in 1911. Four of the six\nessays in The Hope of the Great Community, written in the\nlast year of his life and published posthumously in 1916, directly\nconcerned global politics and the Great War. \nRoyce and James had always disagreed deeply concerning the proper\nunderstanding of religious phenomena in human life. When James\ndelivered the Gifford Lectures in 1901 and 1902, he directed many\narguments against Royce’s idealism, though he did not there\ntarget his friend by name. James’s lectures, published as\nThe Varieties of Religious Experience, were a popular and\nacademic success . Royce believed that James, who had never been\nregularly affiliated with an established church or religious\ncommunity, had in that work placed too much emphasis on the\nextraordinary religious experiences of extraordinary individuals.\nRoyce’s first education was into a strongly Protestant world\nview, he always retained a respect for the conventions of organized\nChristianity, and his writings exhibit a consistent and deep\nfamiliarity with Scripture. He sought a philosophy of religion that\ncould help one understand and explain the phenomena of ordinary\nreligious faith as experienced by communities of ordinary people.\nThere was a deeper difference between them, as well, and it centered\non a metaphysical point. Royce’s 1883 insight concerning the\nAbsolute was at bottom a religious insight. Contrary to the open-ended\npluralism and pragmatism of James, Royce was convinced that the object\nand source of religious experience was an actual, infinite, and\nsuperhuman being. Royce did not attempt to work out his religious\nphilosophy until after James’s death, however. In 1911 Royce\nfinally composed the lectures that responded to James. These were\npublished in 1912 as The Sources of Religious Insight. It is\nhere that the theoretical and practical threads of his late thought\nbegan to come together. Royce himself said of the Sources:\n“It contains the whole of me in a brief compass”\n(Clendenning 1970, 570). \nIn early 1912, Royce suffered a stroke. During his recovery, he\ncontinued to explore the philosophy of religion outlined in the\nSources, with an eye toward adapting these ideas specifically\nto Christianity. He also returned to Peirce’s writings, seeking\nthe solution to certain nagging problems in his own metaphysics. He\nfound in Peirce’s semeiotic, or theory of signs, the technical\ntools he needed to address both issues at once. The Problem of\nChristianity presents, in place of the earlier Absolute Knower,\nthe concept of an infinite community of interpretation guided by a\nshared spirit of truth-seeking. This Universal Community, which\nconstitutes reality, develops greater understanding over time through\nits members’ continual development of the meaning of signs.\nWithin this framework Royce endeavored to reconcile and explain many\nkey Christian doctrines and experiences. \nThough Royce lived only a few years beyond this late philosophical\nbreakthrough, his last period brought the true culmination and\nflowering of his life’s work. Besides The Sources of\nReligious Insight and The Problem of Christianity,\nnotable available works include The Hope of the Great\nCommunity, his last Harvard seminar on Metaphysics\n(1915–16) and a series of lectures given at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley. These lectures at his alma mater were to have\nended with a talk entitled “The Spirit of the Community.”\nWhen the Great War broke out, Royce set this manuscript aside and\nsketched a practical proposal to use the economic power of insurance\nto mediate hostilities among nations and hence reduce the attraction\nof war in the future. War and Insurance (1914) was a daring\npolitical and economic proposal on behalf of the Universal\nCommunity. \nRoyce died on September 14, 1916. Though scholars now recognize the\noriginality and strength of his last works, he was unable to respond\nto critics or to press his case for the last crucial innovations to\nhis philosophy. His reputation was eclipsed as other philosophers used\nRoyce’s earlier writings as a foil in developing their own\ndoctrines of pragmatism, realism, empiricism, and logical analysis.\nWhile scholars of American intellectual life have always acknowledged\nthe historical importance of Royce’s influence, recent years\nhave brought a revival of interest in Royce’s thought on its own\nterms. Royce’s work is proving especially fruitful for\ntheologians and philosophers interested in speculative philosophy and\nmetaphysics, practical and theoretical ethics, philosophy of religion,\nand the philosophy of community. \nRoyce’s early studies in Germany and at the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity concentrated on the development of post-Kantian idealism.\nHis philosophical work as a whole may be regarded as a committed\nidealist’s effort to understand the place of finite individuals\nin an infinite universe, a theme that Royce captured most succinctly\nin his Gifford Lectures title, “The World and the\nIndividual.” This theme will serve as a touchstone in the\nfollowing survey of Royce’s work in metaphysics and\nepistemology, ethics and practical philosophy, religious philosophy,\nand logic. \nRoyce announced the beginning of his professional career with a novel\ndefense of absolute idealism, “the argument from error.”\nKant had introduced the notion of a “transcendental\nargument” by asking what the world must be like in order for\nknowledge of the world to be possible. In The Religious Aspect of\nPhilosophy Royce took the experience of error — a\nparticularly compelling aspect of the phenomenon of knowing — as\nthe starting point for his own transcendental argument. According to\nthe correspondence theory of knowledge an idea (or judgment) is true\nif it correctly represents its object; error obtains when an idea does\nnot correctly represent its object. It is indisputable that finite\nminds do sometimes entertain erroneous ideas. Royce pointed out that\nin such a case the mind must contain an (erroneous) idea and its\n(false) object, while simultaneously intending, or “pointing\ntoward,” the idea’s true object. If the mind is able to\nintend the true object then that object is somehow available to the\nmind. How can it be that the true object is in this way available to\nthe mind, but not known? Consider what happens in an ordinary example\nof error: if I think that my keys are on the table, but later discover\nthat they are in my pocket, I do not conclude that my keys never\nexisted as the object of my thought. Rather, I focus on an idea that I\nhad all along — that my keys do definitely exist somewhere. The\nkeys, their location, and all other facts about them are the true\nobject of an idea. At the moment when I discover that my keys are not\non the table, it becomes apparent that this true object was only\nimperfectly available to me. The fact that such error does occur\nindicated to Royce that the true object of any idea must exist, in a\nfully determinate or absolute state, in some actual mind with which my\nown mind is or may be connected. From the possibility of error, Royce\nconcluded that there is an Absolute Knower, a mind for which all\nthoughts do correspond correctly and adequately to their true\nobjects. \nOne objection to the argument from error is that another type of\nobjective reality, some other sort of being external to one’s\nfinite mind, might explain the possibility of error just as well.\nRoyce took up this objection in the first volume of The World and\nthe Individual, which was subtitled “The Four Historical\nConceptions of Being.” In this extended argument Royce critiqued\nwhat he regarded as the main competing conceptions of objective\nreality so as to strengthen his case for idealism. The first\nconception of being Royce considered was realism, the view\nthat the world exists entirely independently of our thoughts or ideas\nabout it. The world is what it is, in short, without any reference to\nour thoughts. While this view has great common-sense appeal and does\nprovide for an objectively existing sphere of being against which our\nideas can apparently be measured, Royce pointed out a fundamental\nproblem. Realism, so defined, introduces a radical metaphysical\ndualism. Between my ideas, and a sphere of being that by definition\nexists completely independent of those ideas, there is a gap that\ncannot be bridged. Realism posits an objective realm that is utterly\nindependent and hence, strictly speaking, is utterly meaningless to\nthought. The theory of mysticism, the second conception of\nbeing Royce considers, likewise meets with problems. This view\nmaintains that the real is the ineffable immediate fact that is\npresent to the mind. Mysticism avoids the problem of an unbridgeable\ngap between idea and reality by completely denying any such gap. The\ndifficulty here is that one cannot then distinguish between idea and\nreality. If reality is in the end the immediate content of my idea,\nthen error in my idea of reality would simply appear to be impossible.\nThe third conception of being, which Royce identifies with Kantian\ncritical rationalism, is presented as a correct but\nincomplete view. Royce characterizes critical rationalism as the view\nthat “What is, gives warrant to ideas, makes them true, and\nenables us to define determinate, or valid, possible\nexperiences” (Royce 1899–1901 [1976, 266]). The real is\nthat which, in conforming to given universal structures or categories\nof experience, is capable of validating certain ideas. The connection\nbetween my ideas and an objectively existing sphere of being is\nclearly established: my ideas and that sphere both conform to the same\ncategories of experience. The independence of objective reality, and\nhence the possibility of error, is likewise preserved: I may form an\nidea of a definite possible experience (e.g., that my keys are on the\ntable) but then discover that reality does not validate my idea (I can\nin fact check the table surface and discover that my keys are not\nthere). The critical rationalist conception is inadequate, in\nRoyce’s view, because it is restricted to describing the\nuniversal forms and possibilities of experienced reality. It cannot in\nRoyce’s view account for the concrete, actual individual facts\nthat impose themselves in experience. These are simply and\nmysteriously “given” in the critical rationalist\ntheory. \nRoyce endeavored to extend and complete critical rationalism in his\nexplanation of the “fourth conception of being.”\nTo say that an idea intends its object means more than that the idea\nmay be validated by a “possible experience.” An idea in\nthis respect embodies a purpose: that its meaning shall be fulfilled\nin experience. In Royce’s view this requires a world that is\nmore than the abstract or merely hypothetical content posited by the\ndescription of a possible experience. What is needed is a definite,\nactual individual being that exists “in an absolutely final\nform.” Royce thus agrees with critical rationalism in saying\nthat a true idea is one that may be fulfilled or validated by a\npossible experience. He argues further, though, that such a possible\nexperience requires the existence of an actual being (e.g., the\nparticular set of keys in my pocket) that is in principle capable of\nbeing experienced. It is this being, the actual individual, and not\nthe mere possible experience of it, that is the object of knowledge\nand “the essential nature of Being” (Royce\n1899–1901, [1976, 348]). The “fourth conception of\nbeing” detailed in The World and the Individual\nprovides the metaphysical background for the remainder of\nRoyce’s thought. It presents a view of the totality of Being as\nan actual Infinite Individual that is itself timeless, encompassing as\nit does all valid past, present, and future possible experience of\nfact. All finite beings, such as ourselves, are but fragments of this\nAbsolute Mind or eternal truth. \nIn his last period Royce embraced what may be called a hermeneutic\nepistemology. While he still maintained the central notion that a true\nidea correctly represents its object, he arrived at a new\nunderstanding of the nature of representation. Earlier, he had rather\nuncritically taken “representation” to be a\nstraightforward correspondence relation in which the idea merely\ncopied its object. Under the influence of Peirce’s theory of\nsigns, however, Royce came to appreciate the creative, synthetic, and\nselective aspects of representation. The new semiotic conception is\ndetailed in the chapter of The Problem of Christianity\nentitled “Perception, Conception and Interpretation.”\nKnowledge is not at bottom merely the accurate and complete perception\nof an object, as empiricism would have it. Nor is it the accurate and\ncomplete conception of an idea, as rationalism maintains. Knowledge is\ninstead a process of interpretation: the true idea selects,\nemphasizes, and re-presents those aspects of the object that will be\nmeaningfully fulfilled in subsequent experience. Royce’s\n“absolute pragmatism,” like other versions of pragmatism,\nthus offers an alternative to rationalism and empiricism. \nThis revised understanding of knowledge as interpretation prompted, if\nit did not exactly require, a corresponding change in Royce’s\nnotion of the Infinite Mind whose reality was established in the\nargument from error. As long as knowledge is regarded as possessing\nperceptions or conceptions that correspond to objects, the Infinite\nMind is naturally envisioned as something that “contains”\nthe totality of all perceptions or conceptions. If knowledge is\ninstead regarded as a process of interpretation, though, the Infinite\nMind may be regarded as the mind that carries this process forward.\nRoyce had long sought an explicitly non-Hegelian account of Absolute\nMind. In The Problem of Christianity he was finally able to\nreplace the old terminology of the Absolute with a description of an\ninfinite Community of Interpretation. This community is the totality\nof all those minds capable of representing aspects of Being to one\nanother or to their future selves. Royce summarized the metaphysical\nimplications of this new view by saying “the real world is the\nCommunity of Interpretation… If the interpretation is a\nreality, and if it truly interprets the whole of reality, then the\ncommunity reaches its goal [i.e., a complete representation of Being],\nand the real world includes its own interpreter” (Royce 1913\n[2001, 339]). In this late period Royce remained firmly committed to\nidealism. He renounced the notion that the Absolute is complete at any\nactual time, though, and instead preferred to think of the possible\ntotality of all truth simply as the eternal. \nThat Royce’s metaphysical solution to the problem of error was\nof broad relevance for the rest of his philosophy is clear: “The\nexistence of error…must be explained as due to the same\nconditions as those which make possible finite life, evil,\nindividuality, and conflict in general” (Robinson 123). Error is\npossible, according to Royce, only if there is an infinite being for\nwhich all intended objects could be realized. This Being (whether\nconceived as Absolute Mind or the infinite Community of\nInterpretation) also makes individual human life comprehensible.\nRoyce’s considerable attention to speculative metaphysics is\ncomplemented by his concern for the practical implications of that\nmetaphysics. The infinite manifests itself in the realm of individual\nbeings bound within the constraints of time, space, and finitude.\nEthics and religion have their basis in this relation of the\nindividual to the infinite real world, a relation Royce characterized\nin terms of loyalty. \nNear the end of The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce wrote: \nRoyce’s ethics is rooted in his analysis of the conditions\nnecessary for an individual life to be meaningful. It is not enough\nthat one’s actions merely conform to the strictures of\nconventional morality — a trained animal might well fulfill such\nminimal conditions of morality. To lead a morally significant life,\none’s actions must express a self-consciously asserted will.\nThey must contribute toward realizing a plan of life, a plan that is\nitself unified by some freely chosen aim. Such an aim and its\ncorresponding plan of life could not easily be created by an\nindividual out of the chaos of conflicting personal desires and\nimpulses that we all encounter. Rather, such aims and plans are found\nalready largely formed in social experience: we come to consciousness\nin a world that proffers countless well-defined causes and programs\nfor their accomplishment. These programs extend through time and\nrequire the contributions of many individuals for their advancement.\nWhen one judges a cause to be worthwhile and freely embraces such a\nprogram, several momentous things happen. The individual’s will\nis focused and defined in terms of the shared cause. The individual\nbecomes allied with a community of others who are also committed to\nthe same cause. Finally, a morally significant commitment to the cause\nand to the community develops. This commitment is what Royce calls\n“loyalty.” The moral life may be understood in terms of\nthe multiple loyalties that a person exhibits. \nJust as the truth value of an idea is a matter of whether its intended\nobject is fulfilled in reality, the moral value of actions is a matter\nof whether they are loyal, whether they tend to fulfill the\ncommunity’s intended aim. Loyalty is a necessary condition for\nmoral validity; defined narrowly, as Royce prefers, loyalty may even\nbe a sufficient condition for moral validity. Royce’s narrow\ndefinition of loyalty, of “true loyalty,” is intended to\nrule out loyalty to morally evil causes and the communities that serve\nthem. Royce observes that the highest moral achievements throughout\nhistory have involved individuals’ loyalty to ideals that\npromote the formation and expansion of communities of loyalty. Many of\nthe worst deeds have also involved a high degree of loyalty, but this\nloyalty is directed exclusively to a particular group and is expressed\nin the destruction of the conditions for others’ loyal actions,\nof those other persons, and even of one’s own community and\ncause. Royce generalized the difference between true loyalty and\nvicious or “predatory” loyalty as follows: \nWhile every community hopes for the accomplishment of its central\ncause, and sees that cause’s fulfillment as its highest\nachievement, Royce places particularly high emphasis on the phenomenon\nof loyalty to a lost cause. A lost cause is not in Royce’s view\na hopeless cause, but rather one that cannot be fulfilled within the\nactual lifetime of the community or any of its members. Many lost\ncauses are rightly lost, of course: Royce would have recognized the\nConfederate States’ defense of slavery during the U.S. Civil War\nas such a case. Besides such misguided causes, though, there are a\nnumber of legitimate causes that are, by this definition,\n“lost” simply in virtue of their scope and magnitude. Such\ncauses are not hopeless, however. It is precisely these causes that\nestablish ideals capable of evoking our highest hope and moral\ncommitment. \nChief among these are the universal causes of the full attainment of\ntruth, the complete determination of the nature of reality through\ninquiry and interpretation, and of the establishment of universal\nloyalty to loyalty itself. In practice, the formula of “loyalty\nto loyalty” demands that one’s moral and intellectual\nsphere become ever broader and remain critical at all levels. All the\ncommunities we actually know, those we inhabit and identify with, are\nfinite and to some degree “predatory” in Royce’s\nsense. This is clearly true of small social cliques, isolated\nintellectual communities, parochial religious groups, self-interested\nunions and corporations, local political movements, and other such\ngroups. Roycean loyalty requires one to scrutinze the aims and actions\nof such communities and to work to reform their disloyal aspects. The\nphilosophy of loyalty calls us first of all, then, to create and\nembrace more cosmopolitan and inclusionary communities. It should be\nclear that this is only the first important step of an infinite\nprocess aimed at realizing the ideal of universal loyalty. Any actual\ncommunity, whether it be the United Nations or a bickering family,\nwill in fact fall short of perfect loyalty. When it does so, each must\nanswer to the same critical scrutiny and calls for reform. There is no\nexpectation that these high ideals of perfect loyalty, truth and\nreality will ever be fully realized. These “lost causes”\nare indispensible, in Royce’s view, as the source of absolute\nnorms for any community and its members. \nRoyce maintained that the logic of volition, pursued far enough,\ncompels us to embrace precisely these lost causes as our own. In the\ncourse of his extended debate with James over the adequacy of\npragmatism as a doctrine, Royce came to accept many of James’s\nprinciples. One, inspired by James’s well-known essay “The\nWill to Believe,” is that any philosophical view is at bottom an\nexpression of individual volition. Given the fact of our existence in\nthe world, we must first decide how we are to approach that world, and\nthen develop our philosophical theories accordingly. A second\nprinciple that Royce adopted is the pragmatist view of truth: truth is\nthe property possessed by those ideas that succeed in the long run.\nRoyce’s main disagreements with pragmatism concern the way these\ntwo principles are typically understood. Royce maintains that although\nthere are several possible attitudes of the will that one might adopt\ntoward the world (including Schopenhauer’s “will to\nlive” and its opposite, resignation) only one — loyalty to\nthe ideal of an ultimate truth — is correct. The other possible\nattitudes of the will are self-refuting. He accordingly refers to his\nown position as “Absolute Voluntarism” (Royce 1913 [2001,\n349]). Royce offers a similar argument concerning the pragmatist notion\nof truth (Royce 1913 [2001, 279]). Explicitly adopting one of\nPeirce’s concepts, Royce argues that to define truth using any\nconception of “the long run” — short of the ideal\nend of inquiry — is self-refuting. Given the apparent finality\nof this argument (which is, again, a variation of the Argument from\nError) Royce calls his position “Absolute Pragmatism.” \nRoyce’s philosophy of loyalty resembles existentialism in\ncertain respects. Notable among these are the notions that we come to\nmoral awareness in a world of already established aims and social\nprojects, that moral responsibility requires a self-conscious and\ndeliberate individual choice to embrace particular causes, and that\nthe highest forms of ethical conduct involve dedication and effort in\nservice of a cause that offers no promise of final success. Royce\ndiffers from later existentialists such as Camus and Sartre, however,\nin several important respects. Royce would not accept their notion\nthat human efforts are finally absurd, unfolding against a backdrop of\na meaningless and indifferent universe. On the contrary, Royce\nmaintains that the concepts of ultimate meaning and reality are\npowerful and legitimate forces in our lives. With existentialism,\nRoyce recognizes the very real chasms that separate one person’s\nfeelings, thoughts, and will from another: the experience of another\nmay be inscrutable. At the same time, though, he insists that we\nacknowledge the equally important fact that in ordinary social life\nminds frequently do work in concert. Groups of people often are\nunified in feeling, thought, and will by something that transcends any\nof the individuals present (Royce 1913 [2001, 239]). \nRoyce was one of the first American philosophers to recognize the\nimportant challenge of Nietzsche’s moral vision, which\ncelebrates those individuals who seek to exercise their autonomous\nwill to a “socially idealized” power. Such heroic\nindividualism, also associated with Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nand William James, proves unsatisfactory in Royce’s view (Royce\n1908 [1995, 41]). Their inspiring ethical visions are doomed to\nineffectiveness precisely because of their extreme individualism.\n“There is only one way to be an ethical individual. That is to\nchoose your cause, and then to serve it, as the Samurai his feudal\nchief, as the ideal knight of romantic story his lady, — in the\nspirit of all the loyal” (Royce 1908 [1995, 47]). These\nparticular examples are meant to illustrate the essentially social\ncharacter of loyalty in general: “My life means nothing, either\ntheoretically or practically, unless I am a member of a\ncommunity” (Royce 1913 [2001, 357]). \nOne of the more striking features of Royce’s philosophy is its\nemphasis on communities as being logically prior to individuals. As we\nhave seen, Royce considers the notions of truth and knowledge\nunintelligible for the individual unless we posit an ultimate knower\nof objective truth, the infinite community of minds. The notions of\npersonal identity and purpose are likewise unintelligible unless we\nposit a community of persons that defines causes and establishes\nsocial roles for those individuals to embrace. The concept of\ncommunity is thus central both to Royce’s ethics and his\nmetaphysics. Not just any association or collection of individuals is\na community. Community can only exist where individual members are in\ncommunication with one another so that there is, to some extent and in\nsome relevant respect, a congruence of feeling, thought, and will\namong them. It is also necessary to consider the temporal dimensions\nof community. “A community constituted by the fact that each of\nits members accepts as a part of his own individual life and self the\nsame past events that each of his fellow-members accepts, may\nbe called a community of memory.” Similarly, “A\ncommunity constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as\npart of his own individual life and self, the same expected\nfuture events that each of his fellows accepts, may be called\na community of expectation or…a community of\nhope” (PC 248). These common past and future events, which\nall members hold as identical parts of their own lives, are the basis\nof their loyalty to the community. \nAs discussed in connection with Royce’s ethical theory, some\ncommunities are defined by true loyalty, or adherence to a cause that\nharmonizes with the universal ideal of “loyalty to\nloyalty.” He refers to such communities as “genuine\ncommunities” or “communities of grace.” Other\ncommunities are defined by a vicious or predatory loyalty. These\ndegenerate “natural communities” tend toward the\ndestruction of others’ causes and possibilities of loyalty.\nFinally, beyond the actual communities that we directly encounter in\nlife there is the ideal “Beloved Community” of all those\nwho would be fully dedicated to the cause of loyalty, truth and\nreality itself. \nRoyce stresses that the sharing of individuals’ feelings,\nthoughts, and wills that occurs in any community (including the\nBeloved Community) should not be taken to imply a mystical blurring or\nannihilation of personal identities. Individuals remain individuals,\nbut in forming a community they attain to a kind of second-order life\nthat extends beyond any of their individual lives. Where a number of\nindividuals’ loyalty to a cause is coordinated in community over\ntime, Royce speaks non-figuratively of a super-human personality at\nwork: a genuine community is united by a guiding or\n“interpreting spirit.” The interpreting spirit may on\noccasion be embodied by a single person such as a leader or other\nexemplar, but this is not always the case. \nThough his writings contain a great deal of insight that is relevant\nfor a strictly naturalistic philosophy, religious concerns figure\nprominently from Royce’s first major publication, The\nReligious Aspect of Philosophy, to his last two, The Sources\nof Religious Insight and The Problem of Christianity. As\nhas been indicated, the main focus of Royce’s early work was\nmetaphysical. In The World and the Individual he plainly\nidentified the object of his inquiry as “the Individual of\nIndividuals, namely the Absolute, or God himself” (Royce\n1899–1901, 1:40). Critics of Royce’s early works admired\nhis metaphysical argumentation but found his conception of God\nwanting. Peirce observed that the Absolute Mind bore little\nresemblance to the God that people seek in churches — it is not\nthe kind of being anyone would worship. James objected that if all our\nerrors and sorrows are in fact reconciled in the Absolute, then finite\npersons would seem to be exonerated from ultimate responsibility for\ntheir actions: they might as well enjoy a lifelong “moral\nholiday.” With The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce began to\ndevote more attention to the practical questions of ethics and the\nphilosophy of community. In his last works he drew upon the notion of\nloyalty to explain the nature of religious experience in human\ncommunities. \nRoyce states that “the central and essential postulate” of\nevery religion is that “man needs to be saved” (Royce 1912\n[2001, 8–9]). Salvation is necessary because of a combination of\ntwo factors. The first is “the idea that there is some aim or\nend of human life which is more important than all other aims.”\nThe second is that “man as he now is, or as he naturally is, is\nin great danger of so missing this highest aim as to render his whole\nlife a senseless failure” (Royce 1912 [2001, 12]). Salvation\ncomes in the form of guidance toward understanding and accomplishing\nthe highest aim of life, so far as we are able. Given the limitations\nand fallibility of the human perspective, Royce maintains that this\nguidance must come from some super-human or divine source. Religion is\nthe sphere of life in which finite human beings are able to get into\ntouch with this divine source of wisdom and guidance. \nIn The Sources of Religious Insight Royce considers and\nrejects several common conceptions of religion before making his case\nfor a religion of loyalty. His discussion of natural social\nlife as a source of religious insight may be read as a critique\nof the “Social Gospel” movement. His consideration of\nreason is notable not for its familiar observation that\nreason is inadequate to religious knowledge, but for his pragmatist\ncritique of the adequacy of mere reason even for scientific knowledge.\nFinally, his careful consideration and rejection of\nindividualism in religion is a direct critique of the\nJamesean view of religious experience. Royce employs his familiar\ndialectical method to make his case for religious insight through\nparticipation in the loyal community, the “invisible\nchurch” guided by a divine spirit and devoted to the highest\nideals of goodness. In the Sources Royce offers a view of\nreligion as common experience. It is “common” both in the\nsense that it does not primarily consist of the kind of extraordinary\nexperiences that James emphasized, and in the sense that it is a\nfundamentally social rather than individual experience of reality. \nWhile the Sources concerns the nature of religious experience\nin general, The Problem of Christianity focuses on the\nquestion “In what sense, if any, can the modern man consistently\nbe, in creed, a Christian?” (Royce 1913 [2001, 62]).\nRoyce’s answer actually rejects the sort of static concepts and\nbeliefs usually implied by devotion to specific creeds, including\nthose identified with Christianity. While his view pivots on the\nChristian notion of divine incarnation, it is not the incarnation of\nGod in Jesus but rather the incarnation of the Spirit in the living\nchurch that Royce emphasizes: “the Church, rather than the\nperson of the founder, ought to be viewed as the central idea of\nChristianity” (Royce 1913 [2001, 43]). The Christian\nchurch’s primary importance, for Royce, is as a paradigm of\ncommunity. He regards the Pauline church as the best exemplar of a\ngraced community: at its best, the church strives to embody the\nguiding Interpreter Spirit, so as to become a Universal Community of\nInterpretation “whose life comprises and unifies all the social\nvarieties and all the social communities which…we know to be\nreal” (Royce 1913 [2001, 340]). Doctrines and creeds may change;\nthe particular institutions that identify themselves as churches may\nor may not actually be communities of grace. What matters in the end\nis the process of interpretation — the process of communicating\nand understanding one another in actual, imperfect, finite communities\nof grace bound together by loyalty and striving toward the ultimate\nand ideal Beloved Community. \nRoyce is critical of many historical churches because they have in his\nview lost sight of the spirit that ought to guide them. At the same\ntime he would identify grace at work in many communities that are not\nself-consciously religious. He had great respect for non-Christian\nreligions, paying especially careful attention to Buddhism (Royce took\nthe trouble to learn Sanskrit, and The Problem of\nChristianity includes a very sympathetic presentation of\nBuddhism). In the end, however, Royce was a philosopher who worked\nwithin the intellectual context of Western Christianity. He maintains\nthat only the Christian model of the loyal community successfully\ncombines the true spirit of universal interpretation with an\nappreciation of the “infinite worth” of the individual as\na unique member of the ideal Beloved Community, the Kingdom of Heaven\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 193]). \nThe problem of evil is a persistent theme throughout Royce’s\nwritings. He struggled with tragedy in his personal life and sought to\nunderstand it better through philosophy. As an idealist he also had to\nstruggle with evil as a problem of metaphysics. Idealism maintains\nthat all deeds and events are ultimately taken up and reconciled in a\nfinal perspective. This seems to suggest that the evil, sorrow, and\npain that run through human life are illusory — or what seems\neven less comprehensible, that our experience of suffering is somehow\ngood, that it is “all for the best.” While some idealists\nhave accepted these apparent implications of their metaphysics, Royce\nmaintained that evil is a real fact of the world. He insisted that we\nconfront evil as evil and not regard it as a means to attain\na preordained but inscrutable Divine purpose. He sought to understand\nevil philosophically. In seeking that understanding he was not content\nto explain it away or to salve its effects by appealing to a clever\ntheodicy. \nRoyce embraced a theistic process metaphysics that recognizes evil as\na real force and suffering as an irreducible fact of experience. In\n“The Problem of Job” Royce addressed the traditional\nproblem of evil: “Grant Job’s own presupposition that God\nis a being other than this world, that he is its external creator and\nruler, and then all solutions fail. God is either then cruel or\nhelpless, as regards all finite ill of the sort that Job\nendures.” If we consider that God is not a separate being, then\n“When you suffer, your sufferings are God’s\nsufferings, not his external work, not his external penalty, not the\nfruit of his neglect, but identically his own personal woe. In you God\nhimself suffers, precisely as you do, and has all your concern in\novercoming this grief.” Grief is not “a physical means to\nan external end,” but rather “a logically necessary and\neternal constituent of the divine life” (McDermott 1969, 843).\nThough Royce believed that events are collectively tending toward an\nultimate reconciliation in the eternal perspective of the Beloved\nCommunity, they are not erased even in that ideal perspective. The\nevents of life (joyful and sorrowful alike) persist, both as\nexperiences of the individuals who undergo them and also as\nGod’s own experiences. \nRoyce does not seek to explain away or lessen the reality of evil: it\nis in his view a brute fact of being, an inevitable result of the\nworld’s existence in time. Given the fact of evil, the most\nimportant question concerns how we finite beings ought to respond to\nit. His answer is that we should adopt the attitude of loyalty to\ngoodness and truth, which as real forces in the world are the\nmetaphysical opposite of evil. The loyal member of a genuine community\nconfronts evil and wills to overcome it through the very fact of\nloyalty to its opposite. Evil can never be eradicated — this is\nanother way of saying that loyalty to loyalty is a lost cause. Though\nthe success of this high cause lies in the unreachable\nfuture, the meaning of our response is manifest in our\npresent lives. \nRoyce’s powerful and original explanation of the doctrine of\natonement in The Problem of Christianity details how the\nloyal community can best respond to human evil. The highest kind of\ntransgression in an ethics of loyalty is treason, or the willful\nbetrayal of one’s own cause and the community of people who\nserve it. The traitor is one who has freely embraced a cause and\njoined with a community of grace in service of that cause, but who\nthen culpably commits some act that undermines the cause and the\ncommunity. Such a betrayal is but one step away from moral suicide: it\nthreatens to destroy the network of purposes and concrete social\nrelationships that define the traitor’s self (Royce 1913 [2001,\n162]). Atonement occurs when the traitor and the community are\nreconciled, when they are both saved from the evil deed through some\nact of the will. \nRoyce finds traditional Christian accounts of atonement\nunsatisfactory. They do not adequately explain how both the traitor\nand the community are reconciled and saved in the human sphere. Much\nless do they explain the mysterious details of how atonement\nreconciles the sinner with God. The traitor who recognizes the\nmagnitude of what has been lost through the act of betrayal lives in a\nstate that Royce calls “the hell of the irrevocable”\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 162]). Royce seeks an explanation of atonement that\nacknowledges the irrevocable nature of a deed that has been done, and\nwhich changes everything for the sinner and the community that has\nbeen harmed. “Penal satisfaction” theories of atonement\nsimply do not speak to the sinner’s situation: to be told that\nan angry God demands repayment or retribution for the betrayal, and\nthat this price has been paid (by the violent death of Jesus Christ,\nor by any other sacrifice) does not repair the sinner’s own\ndevastated moral universe. The sinner “is dealing, not with the\n‘angry God’ of a well-known theological tradition, but\nwith himself” (Royce 1913 [2001, 170–71]). Royce seeks a\ntheory that first makes sense of the immediate human aspect of\natonement. If one can be found, it may then be considered\ntheologically. A theory of “penal satisfaction,” which\nclaims to answer theological questions but remains meaningless or\nmysterious in human terms, is simply unsatisfactory. \nThe concrete human evil of treason is that the traitor’s loyalty\nto the cause, and with it the moral relations that bound the community\ntogether, have been broken and cannot be restored to their previous\nstate. “Moral theories” of atonement account for change in\nthe traitor’s person but fail to explain how the “wounded\nor shattered community” can be repaired (Royce 1913 [2001,\n175]). Such theories, in Royce’s account, explain that in\ncontemplating Christ’s willing sacrifice of his own life for the\nsake of the human community, the sinner experiences deep repentance\nand develops a new capacity for love of the betrayed community. The\nsinner’s soul is purified and made better (Royce 1913 [2001,\n172]). Such a process may bring the sinner to realize the hellish\nmagnitude of irrevocable treason. Royce points out, though, that such\na process by itself does nothing to reconcile the sinner to the\ncommunity or to repair that community. Such reconciliation and healing\nrequires something more than a change in the individual’s\nheart. \nThis brings Royce to consider theories of atonement that center upon\nthe community’s act of forgiveness. Forgiveness, as an act of\nthe community and not the sinner, is clearly essential to atonement.\nMoreover, it involves a recognition of human frailty — not just\nthe moral frailty of the sinner in question, but that of all humans.\nForgiveness involves a recognition that anyone might commit such an\nact, that the cause of perfect loyalty is a lost cause. Even when it\ncan occur, though, forgiveness does not restore the community to the\ninnocent state of harmony and “unscarred love” that\nexisted before the betrayal (Royce 1913 [2001, 177–78]).\nAtonement moves the community and the traitor beyond the irrevocable\ndeed of betrayal. This cannot be done by an act of forgiveness that\nreturns the community and its relations to the way things were before.\n“The way things were” is irrevocably gone. \nIn its human aspect atonement occurs through an interpretive act that\ncreates new relationships among the members, including the traitor,\ntogether with a new understanding and fresh embracing of their\nunifying cause. The act of atonement “can only be accomplished\nby the community, or on behalf of the community, through some\nsteadfastly loyal servant who acts, so to speak, as the incarnation of\nthe spirit of the community itself” (Royce 1913 [2001, 180]).\nThis person acts as a mediating third party between the traitor and\nthe betrayed community. Things are not made the same as they were\nbefore through atonement, but are in an important respect made better\n— precisely because of the unique circumstances created by the\noriginal act of treason. Through the atoning act genuine community is\nrestored and all the individuals involved may emerge as wiser, more\nresolved servants of their common cause. In this sense, Royce writes,\n“The world, as transformed by this creative deed, is better\nthan it would have been had all else remained the same, but had that\ndeed of treason not been done at all” (Royce 1913 [2001,\n180]). \nRoyce indicates that this insight about the human aspect of atonement\nprovides the basis for a theological understanding of the atonement\ninvolved in Christ’s teachings and death. He does not himself\narticulate the details of a theological doctrine of atonement,\nhowever. He states “the central postulate” of “the\nhighest form of human spirituality” as follows: “No\nbaseness or cruelty of treason so deep or so tragic shall enter our\nhuman world, but that loyal love shall be able in due time to oppose\nto just that deed of treason its fitting deed of atonement”\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 186]). This postulate cannot be proved true, of\ncourse, but human communities can assert it and act upon it as if it\nwere true. Christian doctrine, as Royce presents it, takes this same\npostulate as “a report concerning the supernatural works of\nChrist” (Royce 1913 [2001, 186]). In The Problem of\nChristianity Royce had set out to answer the question “In\nwhat sense, if any, can the modern man consistently be, in creed, a\nChristian?” One form of his answer, based on this theory of\natonement, is that communities can and should act upon the faith that,\nthrough the spirit of genuine community, atonement is always possible\nas a response to human sin and evil. \nRoyce understood logic as the science of order focused on\n“problems regarding, not the methods by which a thinker\nsucceeds, nor yet the norms, but rather the Forms, the\nCategories, the Types of Order, which characterize\nany realm of objects” (Royce 1913a, 69). In a variety of work\nbeginning with The World and The Individual (1900) continuing\nthrough the remainder of his life in published and unpublished papers,\nRoyce proposed a logical system with both formal and informal,\nphilosophical implications. He called his logic “System\n\\(\\Sigma\\).” \nThe logic of \\(\\Sigma\\) begins, according to Royce, with the ontological\nclaim that the terms of the logic “may be defined as,\n‘certain possible modes of action that are open to any rational\nbeing who can act at all, and who can also reflect upon his own modes\nof possible action’ ” (1913a,\n 130–1).[1] \nHence the subject matter\nof logic is “objects” understood not as fixed entities but\nas “modes of action.” Note that for Royce, a\n‘rational being’ is a purposive being: that is, an agent\nunderstood as something capable of action toward a purpose. In\nWorld and the Individual he writes: “At any moment your\nideas, in so far as they are rational, embody a purpose” (1900,\n441–2). “And so,” he says elsewhere, “the empirical\nworld is a whole, a life fulfilling the purposes of our ideas. It is\nthat or it is nothing” (1900, 368). The logic that Royce\nproposes is therefore a logic of action where actions are taken as\npurposive. \nAs an ontological starting point, modes of action should be understood\nas “general” terms, in the sense proposed by C. S.\nPeirce. Generals, for Peirce, are like habits in that they\nspecify a general state of affairs that can be realized in multiple\ndifferent ways (Peirce, 1931, 2:148). Generals stand in contrast\nto universals. While universals are deductively complete\ncategories, generals are emergent categories where some particulars fit\nclosely to the features specified by the general concept and others\nless so. The category of oak tree, for example, can be realized\nby a wide range of particular oak trees from tall, full trees, to\nsmall, stunted trees, to trees broken by ice and wind. Each is,\nin a general sense, an oak tree, but each realizes the concept in a\nparticular way. The concept of species is likewise general in\nthat a species includes marginal cases that are not clearly in the\ncategory or clearly out of it. While it is tempting (especially\nin the case of terms that are defined in a particular field of inquiry)\nto suppose that categories are the nominal constructs of inquirers,\nPeirce argued that generals are themselves real (not nominal), so that\nnatural kinds or categories are the products of evolving and\nintersecting activities, and as such are as much discovered as they are\ncreated for purposes of inquiry (Peirce, 8:12; Mayorga,\n2007).  \nModes of action are similarly general. Talk about the relation\nbetween actions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is talk about the relation between two general\nways of acting. When \\(A\\) is actually taken, then it is a particular\ntoken of the type of action \\(A\\) and it stands in a distinctive relation\nwith other modes of action with which it is compatible and still other\nmodes of action with which it is not. By framing his logic as a\nlogic of modes of action, Royce can include both categories of commonly\nunderstood actions (walking, talking, reading, judging), but is also\nable to include any sort of persistent being by seeing a being as a\nprocess involving distinctive characteristic actions in relation to\ngeneral categories or modes of action. An apple is a thing that\nacts like an apple; a mountain is a thing that acts like a mountain; a\nfine pinot noir is thing that acts like a fine pinot noir. The\npower of this approach is that the objects of logic are necessarily\nunderstood as ongoing activities that both close off possibilities and\nopen new ones with each action. \n\nThe primary operation in Royce’s logic is the\nexclusive \ndisjunction[2], \n an operation or possible operation that\ndivides actions into two “obverse” or incompatible\ncategories where if one action from a category is taken, it eliminates\nthe possibility of taking an action in the other.  For example, an\nexclusive disjunction is present when an agent selects a candidate on\na ballot. To select the candidate is to lose the option to choose\nanother or to simply opt out of voting. Put another way, actions are\nexclusively related when they are incompatible, that is, they cannot\nbe taken together. Royce’s logic is founded on the relation that\nexpresses the operation of judgment, that is, the selection by an\nagent of one alternative over another where the alternatives are\nincompatible. System \\(\\Sigma\\) is a logic of modes of action and a\nlogic of agency. \nExclusively-related actions also introduce the operation of\nnegation. When an action is negated, it\nis not taken (or is excluded from the possibility of being\ntaken). So, if action \\(A\\) and action \\(B\\) are related by exclusive\ndisjunction, then if action \\(A\\) is taken, action \\(B\\) is negated,\n\\(\\neg B\\).  \nThe exclusive relation that holds between incompatible actions also\nprovides a context for Royce’s notion of\nequivalence (Royce 1905, 391).  An action, \\(A\\), is\nlogically equivalent to another action, \\(B\\), if and only if they are\ncompatible (one can be taken without excluding the other). So, for\nexample, if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are compatible and \\(B\\) and \\(\\neg B\\)\nare incompatible, then \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg B\\) are also incompatible. If\nso, then \\(A = B\\). In the case of voting just mentioned, the\nthree-term relation (voting for candidate \\(M\\), voting for someone else,\nand not voting at all) are together incompatible.  If we consider the\nfirst option, voting for \\(M\\), then the other two options are equivalent\nbecause they equally eliminate voting for \\(M\\) if one or the other is\ntaken. Equivalence then is relative to compatibility in a given\nsituation defined by a set of incompatible or “obverse”\npossibilities.  \nExclusive disjunction and equivalence suggest two other basic\nrelations among actions: symmetry and asymmetry (Royce 1905,\n379–385; 1913a, 97–100). Exclusive disjunctions are\nsymmetrical in that their order in relation to the disjunctive terms\ndoes not matter. That is, if \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is an exclusive\ndisjunction, then \\(\\neg A\\) or \\(A\\) is also.  Equivalence is also\nsymmetrical in that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are equivalent, then \\(B\\) and\n\\(A\\) are also equivalent. In either case, the actions are not ordered\nwith respect to each other. When actions are ordered such that \\(A\\)\nis antecedent to \\(B\\) (or vice versa), then the relation is\nasymmetrical.  \nIn general, the process of ordering is a twofold\ntransformation. Possibilities of action emerge as symmetrical\nexclusive disjunctions and are transformed into asymmetrical relations\nsuch that one action is antecedent to the other. If \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is an\nexclusive disjunction, then taking action \\(A\\) results in the negation of\naction \\(B\\), such that \\(\\neg B\\) is a consequence of the antecedent taking\nof \\(A\\). The symmetrical exclusive disjunction is transformed by the\naction of an agent into the asymmetrical antecedent/consequent\nrelation. \n\nGiven exclusive disjunction, equivalence, symmetry, and asymmetry,\nRoyce proposed that such relations could be expressed as a single\nordering relation, the obverse or\n\\(O\\)-relation.[3] \nRepresented ‘\\(O(A \\: B)\\)’, the \\(O\\)-relation marks two\npossible courses or modes of action, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and indicates\nthat these courses of action are incompatible: that is, \\(O(A\\: B)\\)\ncan be read as the assertion that action A and action B cannot both be\ntaken or that if \\(A\\) is taken \\(B\\) cannot be taken and vice\nversa. \\(O\\)-relations simultaneously represent a state of affairs\nsuch that two possible courses of action are available, one of which\ncan be actualized and the other excluded. \\(O\\)-relations are also\nsuch that, in the course of things, one of the disjuncts must be\ntaken. If \\(O(A\\: B)\\), then it is also the case that\n“neither” is not an option in just the way that\n“neither” is not an option for \\(O(A \\: \\neg A)\\). The\n\\(O\\)-relation can include as many terms as are, when taken together,\nincompatible and, regardless of the number of terms, they may still be\nreduced to the dyad \\(O(a \\:\\neg a)\\). Taken as a set of incompatible\nactions, \\(O(A \\: B)\\) is an \\(O\\)-collection (Royce 1905,\n390), as are \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) and \\(O(A\\: B\\: C\\: \\ldots \\: n)\\). Now\nif \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incompatible (and so then are \\(\\neg A\\) and\n\\(\\neg B\\)), it is also the case that \\(\\neg A\\) and \\(B\\) are\ncompatible as are \\(\\neg B\\) and \\(A\\). These terms are then related\nby the compatibility relation, equivalence, or the \\(E\\)-relation\n(Royce 1905, 390–391) such that \\(E(\\neg A\\: B)\\) and \\(E(A \\:\\neg\nB)\\). \nRoyce summarized the central ontological claims of his system this\nway: “whatever else the world contains, if it only contains a\nreasonable being who knows and intends his own acts, then this being\nis aware of a certain relation, the relation between performing and\nnot performing any act which he considers in advance of action. And\nthus relations amongst acts are in such wise necessary facts, that\nwhoever acts at all, or whoever, even in ideal, contemplates\npossible courses of action, must regard at least some of\nthese relations as present in the realm of his conceived modes of\naction” (1913a, 120–1.  When Royce introduced the\nformal system \\(\\Sigma\\) in his 1905 paper, “The Relation of the\nPrinciples of Logic to the Foundations of Geometry,” he proposed\nsix “laws” to which \\(O\\)-collections must\nconform. Restated, these six laws are as follows: \nThe six laws are offered by Royce as postulates, but they are\nintended to provide both relational and ontological parameters for\nordering. The first two laws establish the existence of exclusive\ndisjunctions which are necessary for a world in which there are\nagents. Laws three and four establish that the universe is such\nthat it includes a principle of generation or emergence—there is\nat least one thing, and if there is one thing there are infinitely\nmany\n more.[5]\nThe\nfifth and sixth laws stipulate the constraints on emergent\nactions. The fifth law establishes paradoxical objects that,\nwhile compatible with two different incompatible objects, are not\ncompatible with these objects when taken together. Likewise, the\nsixth law established that \\(O\\)-collections also generate new objects or\nterms that extend the possibilities included in a given\nO-collection. The six laws provide the generative landscape in\nwhich agents emerge and operate. They also reinforce the idea\nthat agency is predicated on both selecting possibilities and losing\nthem permanently so that agency, whatever else it involves, entails\nboth opportunity and\n sacrifice.[6] \nSystem \\(\\Sigma\\) then is the process of transforming symmetrically\nrelated possibilities to asymmetrical ordered action through the\nnegation of some possible action(s). In most general terms, this\nallows us to think of \\(O\\)-relations as modal and conditional. If the\n\\(O\\)-relation holds of actions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then it is the case\nthat if \\(A\\) is negated (not taken or sacrificed) then \\(B\\)\nfollows. Rather than being a material conditional \\((\\neg A \\supset\nB)\\), the antecedent and consequent are necessarily related. If\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\) then \\(\\Box (A \\supset \\neg B)\\) and \\(\\Box (\\neg A\n\\supset B)\\).[7]\nConsequently, the dyadic \\(O\\)-relation, \\(O(A\\: B)\\) can also be\nrepresented as \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\) and so as \\(\\Box (A \\supset\n\\neg B) \\wedge \\Box (B \\supset \\neg A)\\). Given the equivalence\nrelation, it follows that \\(B\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg A\\) and so can\nbe substituted for \\(B\\) so that \\(O(A\\: \\neg A)\\) and \\(\\Box (A\n\\equiv \\neg \\neg A)\\). \\(O\\)-relations, however, are not limited to\ndyadic relations. Consider three possible courses of action such that\ntaking any one requires the elimination of the other two courses of\naction (for example, selecting one of three paths at a fork in the\nroad). This situation can be represented as \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\). Note\nthat if \\(A\\) is taken, then neither \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) can be taken so\nthat together, \\((B \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg A\\). Likewise,\nif \\(B\\) is taken, then \\((A \\lor C)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\neg B\\) and\nso on. So \\(O(A\\: B\\: C)\\) is also \nHowever, since the fifth law allows that every pair of incompatible\nactions generates a third term making the initial dyadic \\(O\\)-relation a\ntriadic \\(O\\)-relation, conditional relations require an additional\nrelation that represents both the compatibility of the resulting terms\nand the asymmetrical order created. Royce proposes the F-relation\nfor this purpose. An \\(F\\)-relation (like the\nsymmetrical \\(E\\)-relation) represents the terms of the original \\(O\\)-relation\nmodified so that they are\n compatible.[8] \nIt also adds an additional symbol (the\nvertical stroke) to mark the place of the antecedent term that makes\nthe \\(F\\)-relation\n asymmetrical.[9] \nConsider \\(O(a\\: b)\\) By the fifth law, \\(O(a\\: b)\\) adds a third\nterm, \\(c\\), which is at once compatible with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (that\nis, \\(E(a\\: c)\\) and \\(E(b\\: c)\\)) and taken together with \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) form \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\).  This third element, following the work\nof A.B. Kempe (1890), is “between” \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Royce\n(like Kempe) captures this betweenness by requiring that the new third\nterm be compatible with both terms but not reducible to them. In\neffect, the fifth law says that whenever two actions are incompatible,\nthere exists an action “between” the two that can, with a\ncorrect transformation, order the obverse actions. Using Royce’s\nillustration, Figure 1 represents \\(O(a\\: b\\: c)\\) where \\(c\\) is\ncompatible with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the region where all three fields\noverlap, there are no elements. Figure 2 represents \\( F(\\neg c | a\\:\nb )\\) where the region \\(\\neg c\\) overlaps, and so is compatible with,\nregions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \nFigure 1. \\(O (a\\: b\\: c)\\)\n \nFigure 2. \\(F (\\neg c | a\\: b)\\) \n  \nAs Royce explains, “The \\(F\\)-relation, so long as\n‘obverses’ or ‘negatives’ exist, follows\nimmediately from, and is equivalent to, an \\(O\\)-relation. For, in the\ndiagram [above] if \\(s\\) is the total surface in which \\(a\\), \\(b\\),\nand \\(c\\) are included, then when ‘\\(c\\) is between \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\),’ ‘\\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\neg c\\) (\\(\\neg c\\) being\nthe obverse of \\(c\\)) constitute an \\(O\\)-collection,’ or\n‘are in the \\(O\\)-relation’ ” (Royce 1905,\n387).  \nThe \\(O\\)-relation is transformed into an \\(F\\)-relation by negating\none of the three terms, selecting one term as the antecedent\nand another term as the “origin.” This is written\nas \\(F (\\neg A | B\\: C)\\), where the term to the left of the vertical\nstroke is the antecedent, and the two remaining terms are the\nconsequent and the action “in terms of which” the\nantecedent and consequent are so ordered. The expression can be read:\nIf \\(A\\) is not taken then \\(B\\) follows with respect to \\(C\\).\n“It is this origin, [\\(C\\)],” Royce observes, “which\ngives ‘sense’ to the pair [\\(A\\: B\\)] in the expression\n[\\(A \\supset B\\) with respect to \\(C\\)]” (1905, 407).  \nWhile \\(O\\)-relations are indeterminate as to outcome, since the terms\nare symmetrically related, F-relations mark the selection of possible\ncourses of action and so establish the linear, asymmetrical relations\nof agential action. Royce concludes: “Wherever a linear series\nis in question, wherever an origin of coordinates is employed,\nwherever ‘cause and effect,’ ‘ground and\nconsequence,’ orientation in space or direction of tendency in\ntime are in question, the dyadic asymmetrical relations involved are\nessentially the same as the relation here symbolized by [\\(p \\supset\nq\\) with respect to \\(y\\)]” (1905, 407).  \nThe conditionals that result from the initial \\(O\\)-collection include\n\\(\\neg A \\supset B\\) with respect to \\(C\\), \\(\\neg B \\supset A\\) with\nrespect to \\(C\\), \\(\\neg C \\supset A\\) with respect to \\(B\\), and so\non. Since \\(O\\)-relations are symmetrical, there are as many\nalternative “courses” of action as there are possibilities\nof negation and selection of antecedents and origins. Since the\nconditionals are possibilities, they could also be represented\n“\\(\\Diamond (\\neg C \\supset B)\\), \\(A\\)” where \\(A\\) represents a\nshared propositional \nparameter.[10] \n“It is now possible,” Royce\nconcludes, “to point out that the elements of \\(\\Sigma\\) possess\nthe properties of a system of logical classes, or of entities to which\nthe ordinary algebra of logic applies” (1905, 427). The\nresulting conditionals operate in a system that is like a relevant\npossible world logic were the truth of the conditional is dependent on\nits truth assignment through the propositional parameter that orders\nantecedent and consequent. However, Royce cautions against reliance on\nlogics that are primarily interested in conditional relations. Such\ninterest is a result of our “intellectual habits” but\n“in several respects inferior to the more direct expression in\nterms of \\(O\\)-relations. … When, in fact, we attempt to\ndescribe the relations of the system \\(\\Sigma\\) merely in terms of the\nantecedent-consequent relation, we not only limit ourselves to an\narbitrary choice of origin, but miss the power to survey at a glance\nrelations of more than a dyadic, or triadic character”\n(381–2).  \n\nAs an idealist philosopher, Royce entered the study of logic (with\nother idealists of his time) interested in the operations of the will\nand the formalization of judgment. The central operation in\njudgment is the selection of one alternative and the rejection of\nothers. In the debates about the central logical operations that\nemerged in the 1890s and early 20th century, realist\nphilosophers argued against founding logic on the basic relation that\nemerges in judgments. Rather, they argued in favor of using the\ninclusive disjunction as the starting point. The reason given for\nthis alternative was that the inclusive disjunction provided a better\nmodel for the logic of burgeoning empirical science in two ways. \nFirst, it began with objects already in existence that can be put in\nrelation to other already existing objects. Second, the exclusive\ndisjunction requires the recognition of objects that do not exist in\nthe ordinary sense (negated objects, for example). When the\ndebates ended with the start of World War One, the realist logicians\nheld the field and Royce’s alternative (and the work of other\nidealist logicians) faded from view. \nRoyce’s development of system \\(\\Sigma\\) occurred before modal\nlogic was formalized. While Royce uses the language of necessity and\npossibility in his discussion of logic, his system has no formal place\nfor it. In fact, his student, C. I. Lewis, seeing the need to account\nfor modal operators in understanding the conditionals of logic,\nproposed the first modal system in 1918, two years after Royce’s\ndeath. Lewis’s introduction of the strict conditional as a means\nof correcting Russell and Whitehead’s material conditional\nsystem required the introduction of modal operators to serve, in\neffect, as the parameter needed to connect the antecedent and\nconsequent of conditionals (Pratt 2007). \nRoyce’s project was framed as one fundamentally concerned with\naction as he observed in a 1906 paper. “[T]he fundamental\nlogical relations,” he wrote, “are characteristic not only\nof our world of thought, but also of our world of action. For\nwill-acts involve acceptance and refusal, affirmation and negation, a\nconsciousness of consequences, a facing of alternatives, a union of\nvarious acts in one act; so that the logic of action is in form\nprecisely the same as the logic of abstract thought” (1906,\n100). From this perspective, Royce observed in an unpublished lecture\nfrom 1905, “There is a fundamental relation which may be called\nthe logical relation par excellence. It is the relation between\n‘yes’ and ‘no’, the relation which\ncharacterizes two mutually exclusive alternatives, that together\nexhaust all the possibilities. It is the relation that one faces, when\none has a choice to make. It is also the relation that obtains between\nany logical class and the negative of that class” (1905a,\n6). The \\(O\\)-relation then marks both necessity and possibility (that\nis, it marks a necessary relation between ‘yes’ and\n‘no’ and it exhausts the possibilities). As I observed\nearlier, the \\(O\\)-relation can be captured in modern modal logic by\nrepresenting it as the conjunction of two conditionals such that\n\\(O(A\\: B)\\) is \\(\\Box (A \\equiv \\neg B)\\). Although not founded as a\nmodal logic, system \\(\\Sigma\\) is modal in its operations and so\npotentially formalizable in modal terms.  \n\nRoyce was deeply interested in the developing theories of logic,\nmathematics, and geometry in the 1890s and early 1900s. While he had a\nlifelong interest in logic and mathematics, it was not until 1898, when\nhe attended a series of lectures by C. S. Peirce titled Reasoning\nand the Logic of Things (1898 [1992]), that he undertook a thorough study\nof the work of Cantor, Dedekind, Klein, Cayley and Kempe. Royce\nregarded Peirce’s lectures as “epoch marking,” as he\nnotes in a letter to James (1970, 422), in part because new\nmathematical theory gave him a way to address a central criticism of\nhis metaphysics. \nIn the years immediately prior to the Peirce lectures, Royce’s\nmetaphysical views had been sharply criticized on the grounds that his\nconcept of the Absolute had made individuals unreal, subsumed by the\nwhole (Howison in Royce 1897, 98–9). Royce countered the\ncriticism, by arguing that the Absolute was a system that was composed\nof real individuals (2000, 297, 314–5). Royce, however, was\nunable to provide a compelling formal argument for the possibility of\na system in which the parts of a whole could also be distinct, a\nview rejected with a well-known argument of F. H. Bradley (Royce 1959,\n477–485).  Peirce’s 1898 lecture included a case for his\nthen-current conception of continuity (he proposed several) in which\nthe unified whole was a logical consequence of a universe of discrete\nindividuals (Moore 2007), that is, where “we have now reached a\nmultitude so vast that the individuals of such a collection melt into\none another and lose their distinct identities” (Peirce 1898 [1992,\n159]). In making his case, Peirce called on resources from Boole,\nCantor, Dedekind and Kempe among others. By 1900, Royce offered his\nown version of continuity, the concept of an infinite,\nself-representative system.  Published as a lengthy\n“supplementary essay” to The World and\nIndividual, First Series, and framed as an answer to Bradley,\nRoyce aimed to provide a proof that a single infinite system could\ncontain multitudes of distinct individuals. \nBy 1901, Royce had begun to reframe his metaphysics in terms of the\nErlanger Programm, devised by Klein (1893) as a means of\nclassifying different geometries by identifying what is invariant\nacross transformations in each system. Klein demonstrated that the\ninvariants of projective geometry could be captured in a set of\npostulates that would also hold for Euclidean and other non-Euclidean\ngeometries each of which included the invariants of projective geometry\nand additional invariants (Bell, 1940, 442–448). Royce argued that\nKempe’s system, and Royce’s own System \\(\\Sigma\\), were defined by\nabstract postulates that would be necessary for any system of order\nwhatever including projective geometry. In unpublished notes from 1901,\nRoyce explicitly attributes the source of his discussion to the\nErlanger Programm and argues that invariants of the sort\nidentified by Kempe are illustrated in projective geometry,\n“just” land transactions, “Kant’s moral\nworld,” musical performance, and selves. For Royce, the\ninvariants of geometry and so findings based upon their analysis could\ndirectly inform the analysis of other ordering processes (1901,\n96–110). \nThe publication of “The Relation of the Principles of Logic to\nthe Foundations of Geometry” (1905) and “An Extension of\nthe Algebra of Logic” (1913b) were significant works of pure\nmathematics but were also intended to illustrate invariants across\ntransformations of all sorts. Burch (2011) has left open the question\nof how Royce’s work in mathematical logic is related to his\ngeneral philosophical project, but has argued that Royce nevertheless\nmade a significant contribution to mathematical logic by developing\nthe concept of a Boolean Ring and an algebra identical to the system\ndevised at about the same time by Russian logician, Ivan Ivanovich\nZhegalkin, renowned as “the ‘father’ of the Russian\nschool of logic” (231). Central to the Boolean Ring operations and to\nthe larger System \\(\\Sigma\\) is Royce’s development of the\noperation of symmetric difference (discussed elsewhere as the\n\\(O\\)-relation), which is also viewed as one of Royce’s major\ncontributions by later reviewers, Burton and Leblanc (1952). While\nBurch suggests the possibility of a full exposition of System\n\\(\\Sigma\\), apart from Royce’s own there is currently no such\ntreatment available. Burch also discusses Royce’s work in\nphilosophical logic in the introduction to a paper by Royce addressing\nRussell’s paradox as presented in Russell’s 1903 The\nPrinciples of Logic. This paper, Burch argues, both demonstrates\nRoyce’s familiarity with developments in modern logic at the\ntime and presents an alternative resolution of the paradox similar to\nFrege’s response while also offering a non-foundational set\ntheory (1987). Other important assessments of Royce’s work in\nmathematics and logic include early reviews by Sheffer (1908), De\nLaguna (1906), and C. I. Lewis (1916), and more recent assessments\nin papers by Crouch (2011) and Scanlan (2011).","contact.mail":"spratt@uoregon.edu","contact.domain":"uoregon.edu"}]
