[{"date.published":"2017-12-01","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sakya-pandita/","author1":"Jonathan C. Gold","entry":"sakya-pandita","body.text":"\n\n\nSakya Paṇḍita (Sa-skya Paṇḍita Kun-dga’\nRgyal-mtshan, 1182–1251, abbreviated Sapaṇ) is one of\nTibet’s greatest and most influential philosophers. He is the\nintellectual giant of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, famous\namong Tibetans for his learning—signified in his honorific title\nmeaning “Paṇḍit from Sakya”. His\nknowledge was broad, but his expertise is most noted in the areas of\nepistemology (pramāṇa), which included significant\ncontributions in the philosophy of language and the study of debate,\nand the study of language itself through lexicography, grammar and\npoetics. He is often counted as one of the “great\ntranslators” of Tibet’s later transmission period, and he\nis credited with initiating sustained study of\nDharmakīrti’s Pramāṇavārttika and\nDaṇḍin’s Kāvyādarśa, texts\nwith tremendous intellectual historical importance in Tibet. This\nentry will provide a summary of his life and works, and then focus on\na few key points and arguments in his major philosophical works.\n\n\n\n\n Sapaṇ[1]\n was the fourth of the “Five Great Throneholders” of Sakya\n(Tib. sa-skya), the monastery that was the seat of the noble\nKhön clan and the institutional hub for one of the main schools\nof Tibetan Buddhism. The first of the five was Sapaṇ’s\ngrandfather, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, and the second and third were his\nuncles Sonam Tsemo and Drakpa Gyeltsen. His uncles were both celibate\nmonks, so the royal line fell naturally to him, the eldest nephew.\nSapaṇ’s biographies contain hagiographical fancy that\nassimilates his early life to that of the Buddha or other great\nintellects: His mother dreamed of a crowned Nāga king coming to\nher when Sapaṇ entered her womb; as an infant he spoke and wrote\nSanskrit; as a child he was gentle and compassionate, knew many topics\nwithout having studied them, and imbibed the dharma without effort. As\nhe grew (and we enter more realistic history), he received teachings\nfrom many great masters both within his family and abroad, and he\ncontinued to distinguish himself for his preternaturally quick\nmastery, sharp discernment, and elegant instruction. In dreams, he had\nvisions confirming his abilities at understanding the works of\nVasubandhu and Dignāga. \nA major turning point in his life came when the Kashmiri scholar\nŚākyaśrībhadra arrived in Tibet with an entourage\nof paṇḍitas from India and Nepal. Sapaṇ\nwent to meet him and established a crucial relationship with these\nscholars. He was able to hire one of the\npaṇḍitas, Sugataśrī, as a personal\ntutor for three years, and then return to study with\nŚākyaśrī for another five years. It was with these\nscholars that Sapaṇ came to master the linguistic\nsciences—Sanskrit grammar, poetics, and metrics—but also,\nand especially, epistemology (tshad ma). Sapaṇ was said\nto have had various doubts and questions about the understanding of\nDharmakīrti’s philosophy that he had received from his\nearly teachers, which were resolved by his studies under\nŚākyaśrī. He learned to translate under the\ntutelage of Sugataśrī, and then together with\nŚākyaśrī retranslated Dharmakīrti’s\nPramāṇavārttika into Tibetan. \nBefore Sapaṇ, Sakya was a renowned center for the study of the\nLamdre system of the Hevajra Tantra, rooted in the\nmasterful works and reputation of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. Sapaṇ\nestablished Sakya anew as a leader in the study of epistemology.\nSapaṇ engaged in many public, spirited debates with members of\nrival Tibetan schools and, famously, with visiting Brahmanical\npaṇḍitas (including one *Harinanda), whom he is\nsaid to have defeated (see Hugon 2012 on this event). His personal\nreputation, and the tantric reputation of Sakya, were surely important\nfactors behind the Mongol prince Köden inviting him to negotiate\nterms for the Tibetan surrender in 1244. It is not entirely clear just\nwhat the terms turned out to be, and Sapaṇ died in the Mongol\ncapital. But just a few years later, Sapaṇ’s nephew\nPhakpa, whom he had brought with him, was named supreme administrator\nof a united Tibet under Mongol rule—a position that stayed with\nthe Sakya for a century (Wylie 1977 [2003] and Petech 1990). \nSapaṇ composed many short works, but he is best known for five major\nworks:  \nThe first is a popular collection of pithy sayings and moral\ninstructions (Kolmaš 1978); the others are treated further\nbelow. Although it is difficult to summarize his worldview, it is\nhoped that this survey reveals a philosopher of remarkable\nconsistency, vision and depth. \nSapaṇ’s Treasury of Epistemological\n Reasoning[2]\n is one of Tibet’s best known and most consequential\nphilosophical achievements, roundly extolled as a work of genius and\nvalidation of Sapaṇ’s reputation as an emanation of\nMañjuśrī, the bodhisattva of wisdom. It is an\nunrivaled touchstone for Tibetan approaches to concept formation,\nphilosophy of language, cognition and perception. Still, the work has\nan ambiguous legacy. Like the Three Vows, it was mired in\ncontroversy from its debut—controversy around a number of its\nstridently combative positions, but especially, and without end,\ncontroversy around its meaning. What’s more, at least some of\nits advocates were false friends, appropriating the glow of\nSapaṇ’s legacy while making only selective use of the\nwork’s masterful exposition of Dharmakīrti and, especially,\nturning a blind eye to crucial particulars that might call into\nquestion their own cherished\n doctrines.[3]\n Recent scholarship has begun to reveal the work’s own goals and\nplace it within its intellectual contexts, but the project is complex\nand ongoing. This section is, of necessity, only a sketch. \nThe Treasury is staunchly anti-realist about both cognitive\nand linguistic objects. Nominalism and pragmatism are hardly outside\nthe range of expectation for a Buddhist. Yet Tibetans both before and\nafter Sapaṇ (esp. Chapa before, Tsongkhapa after) have tended to\nhew to a more intuitive and “moderate” realism—to\nuse Georges Dreyfus’ terminology (1997). Sapaṇ defends a\nposition that is more spare and more severe than most Tibetan\nepistemologists, and, according to modern scholarship, closer to\n Dharmakīrti.[4]\n Buddhist traditions are widely known for their insistence that\nordinary beings are uniformly deluded and reality seen correctly by a\nBuddha is entirely beyond their (our) ken, so the counter-intuitive\nnature of anti-realism is not at all discomforting to the Indic\nBuddhist mainstream. Sapaṇ certainly considered his own views\nmore accurate and more authentically Indian than those of his Tibetan\nadversaries. This self-understanding was, no doubt, buttressed by the\nfact that he had studied Sanskrit and Indian linguistic sciences with\nthe followers of the Kashmiri scholar\nŚākyaśrībhadra and that with\nŚākyaśrī he had retranslated, and thereby\nrejuvenated the study of, Dharmakīrti’s\nPramāṇavārttika. Association with great\nIndian paṇḍitas gave Sapaṇ the confidence\nto distinguish his own conservative stance from ideas he disparagingly\ncalled “Tibetan” innovations. \nSapaṇ’s main adversaries in his Treasury were\nadherents of the tradition of Ngok (rngog lugs) centered in\nSangpu (gsang-phu) monastery, whose most prominent advocates\nwere Ngog Lotsawa himself and his disciple Chapa Chokyi Senge. As\nChapa’s epistemology gained ascendancy, study of the\nPramāṇavārttika was apparently eclipsed by\nthat of other writings of Dharmakīrti’s (primarily the\nPramāṇaviniṣcaya), and this perhaps had the\neffect of these thinkers losing sight of the key Buddhist\nphilosophical ingredient for a strong anti-realist view: concept\nformation via exclusion\n (anyāpoha).[5]\n Whatever the cause, the significance of this piece of Buddhist\nepistemology seems to have been missed or downplayed by Chapa and his\n followers.[6]\n Sapaṇ’s Pramāṇavārttika\nrenaissance helped to bring the doctrine of apoha back into\nthe center of Buddhist epistemology and thereby resisted the rising\ntide of moderate realism. The great Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), more\nthan a century later, rejuvenated moderate realism in Tibet through a\nnew synthesis of epistemology with Madhyamaka. \nSapaṇ’s strict nominalism rejects the reality of cognitive\nand linguistic objects, which makes him an “illusionist”\nabout the mind. Where Daniel Dennett (1991) criticizes the “Cartesian\ntheater” model of the mind, in which images play across a mental\nscreen, Buddhist philosophers criticize the “duality” that\nconstitutes the subject/object binary. The notion of a cognitive\nobject, for this tradition, is intertwined with the false reification\nof the self, a cardinal Buddhist error. There could only be mental\nobjects if there were mental subjects; viewing subjects and mental\nobjects are attributable, together, to the tendency of ordinary beings\nmistakenly to project a “self”. Moreover, the utility of\nconcepts for language and thought would require that they be\nunchanging against the backdrop of the Buddhist view that all things\nare impermanent; if, as Sapaṇ argues, they were impermanent,\nthey would be mind-dependent, and hence private objects (see Stolz\n2006). What needs to be explained, therefore, is not the reality of\nconcepts, but the causes that bring about their seeming to\nappear and function. \nMahāyāna Buddhists believe that this fundamental error is\nrooted in beginningless karmic tendencies. Our minds have been\nconditioned by our previous actions, and we experience the world\nthrough their capacities and strictures. Our karmic conditioning\nprovides the conceptual nexus through which we think and communicate\nwith other beings who have similar karma and therefore similar\nconceptual tendencies. This karmic basis of conceptualization and\nlanguage, which finds them both to be pragmatically beneficial while\nfundamentally erroneous, is the lynchpin of Sapaṇ’s\nphilosophical position in the Treasury. Against his\ncontemporaries, who rely upon concepts and linguistic objects being\nquasi-real entities in order to account for cognition and language,\nSapaṇ explains the utility of concepts, and the linguistic\nentities to which they are tied, with reference to the same process\nthat makes them erroneous: the never-ending causal flow of karma. Like\nfloating hairs that appear due to ophthalmic disease, cognitive\nobjects are nothing but a failure in the system, and have no\nindependent reality. \nSapaṇ is perhaps uniquely attuned to how decisively it is\nkarma that underwrites the doctrine of apoha, the\nBuddhist approach to concept formation in the light of emptiness. Not\neven Dharmakīrti, whose epistemology courted Buddhists of the\nŚrāvakayāna, was willing to be as vividly pragmatist.\nBe that as it may, Sapaṇ makes constant reference to\nDharmakīrti and is reasonably seen to have provided a faithful\nextension of his views. Above all, Sapaṇ maintains without\nexception the key ontological distinction in Buddhist epistemology\nbetween real, causally effective momentary particulars that are the\npotential objects of perception, and false conceptual constructions\nthat are the seeming objects of cognition. Where all of reality is\ndivided into these categories, we can see even by the definitions that\nconcepts and abstract objects must be unreal. Chapa and his followers\nspoke of intermediate categories of various kinds—cognitive and\nperceptual objects that are not simply momentary bare\nparticulars—and Sapaṇ and his followers targeted them as\ninsufficient to a Buddhist view. \nThe motivation for these intermediate positions is not difficult to\nsee. With such a strict division between momentary perceptual\nparticulars and erroneous linguistic concepts, it is difficult to\nexplain how we could ever arrive at anything like knowledge. This is\nwhere Dignāga’s doctrine of apoha is supposed to\nhelp. Although there are no real concepts and no linguistic\nuniversals, there are apparent universals that we\nmistakenly—but pragmatically—superimpose on real things.\nWe create concepts not by identifying some real quality or similarity\nthat is shared across distinct entities, but by ignoring most of their\ndifferences and “excluding” non-members of a set from a\nconceptual field, outside a pragmatically beneficial boundary. A key\nquestion that arises to challenge this possibility is, How can a\nfallacious boundary be pragmatically beneficial? Why, for instance, is\na concept or a word recognized and shared by various people, if there\nis no real similarity among the objects to which it refers? The\nanswer, which as I’ve said Sapaṇ gives more explicitly\nthan any other thinker, is karma. The mistake of\nsuperimposing what is falsely taken to be a real general concept on an\nactually real particular which it is taken to represent works\nfor beings that tend to see things the same way: \nWith propensities beginninglessly habituated, and having generated the\npower for an error to appear, on the occasion of the sign, without\ndistinguishing the concepts and the particulars, one imputes the sign,\n“This is a pot”. Later, if one says, “Pour the water\nin the pot”, without asking, “Pour the water in the\nindividual pot, or pour it into the concept pot?” one\nunderstands the object of engagement to be the very thing\n itself.[7] \nKarma also provides the answer to the question of how an unreal\nconcept can be stable in a changing mind, and across references to\ndistinct, changing entities. The answer is that concepts are no more\nstable than the “self” is a real, stable entity. Still,\ndue to karma, we have certain tendencies to experience the world in\nsimilarly-patterned modes. Through Buddhist practice, it is possible\nto overcome these; through Buddhist epistemology, it is possible to\nunderstand their erroneous yet beneficial applications. This expresses\na version of the Buddhist karmic causal theory of meaning that has\nbeen noted in Yogācāra thought (see Gold 2006 and Tzohar\n2017a, 2017b). \nThe Three\n Vows[8]\n is a polemical treatise, and it is Sapaṇ’s most\ncontroversial work. It is an assemblage of distinct doctrinal\narguments directed against Sapaṇ’s Tibetan contemporaries,\norganized under the rubric of three sets of vows. The categories of\nvows refer to the three main categories of Buddhist theory and\npractice: (1) Disciples’ (śrāvaka) monastic\nvows, (2) Great Vehicle (mahāyāna) or bodhisattva\nvows, and (3) Mantra/Tantra vows. Before it ever reached Tibet,\nBuddhism in India had developed through these three forms, each with\nits own more-or-less distinct philosophical and ritual framework. Even\nas later systems became preeminent, however, earlier stages of\nBuddhist practice were kept, integrated into lower rungs in a complex\n system.[9]\n Yet although Buddhist intellectuals in India and Tibet took on this\nsystematizing theoretical work, there was never a single institution\ncapable of preventing innovation and experimentation in ritual and\ndoctrine, and over the centuries numerous practices crossed the\nlines ideally set (often after the fact) between the categories. \nConsequently, there were evident divergences between\nidealized systems and their practiced realities, and many conservative\ninstitutional leaders in Tibet during the later diffusion period\n(spyi dar) sought to reign in all errors, but especially\nthose that upset the structured hierarchies of tantric Buddhism. \nIn the Three Vows, then, Sapaṇ’s central concern\nwas to correct errors in his contemporaries’ theories and\npractices, so as to preserve the integrity and the effectiveness of\nthe teachings. As mentioned above, Sapaṇ’s linguistic\ntraining made him confident that he had a better understanding of\nauthentic, Indian sources than most of his contemporaries. He\ntherefore adopts a critical stance against what he considers Tibetan\ninnovations, but his concerns are not merely clerical, and he is not\nsimply nostalgic or obedient to tradition. Nor, if we take him at his\nword, is he simply writing for political gain. On the contrary, he\nprovides a vociferous defense of the use of scripture and reasoning to\nprotect Buddhist doctrine, and he emphasizes the unfairness of those\nwho would claim his critiques are motivated by hostility or jealousy\n(III.625ff.; Rhoton 2002: 178–181). Rather, as he explains near\nthe end of the work, careful and informed analysis is crucial because\neven practices that closely resemble authentic ones can undermine the\nteachings, if they fail to properly follow key points (III.432; Rhoton\n2002: 152). In this context, he concisely summarizes the\n“essentials” he considers sacrosanct for each of the three\ntraditions: For the tradition of the Disciples, they are the monastic\nvows and the four truths; for the Great Vehicle, the thought of\nenlightenment and the discipline of the perfections; and for the\nMantra tradition, the initiation and the two processes of generation\nand completion. If you get these wrong, practice becomes essentially\nnon-Buddhist and most importantly, ineffective. He sees his critiques\nas, above all, practical soteriology. \nUnder this umbrella, Sapaṇ lists ten fallacious doctrines, which\nhe considers a particular threat to the essential teachings in his\nday: \nThese ten errors are by no means the limit of the topics covered in\nthe Three Vows, but they represent the kinds of issues that\nmotivate the work, and they stand at the center of Sapaṇ’s\ndoctrinal disputes with his adversaries. Many of these are reiterated\nthroughout his works—also appearing, for instance, as topics of\ndiscussion in the Sage’s Intent or the Gateway to\nLearning. Here is not the place to examine each of these, which\nwould take us into some rather arcane particulars. Still, although\nmany of these points enact scholastic in-fighting and might seem on\nthe surface to be doctrinal angel-counting, Sapaṇ’s\narguments generally present them as examples of larger concerns. The\ninteresting interpretive question for each, then, is how getting a\ngiven idea wrong disrupts the essentials of the teachings, and what\nthis tells us about Sapaṇ’s approach to the doctrine and\nthe controversies of his time. Here I will focus on two critiques\n (1\n &\n 7)\n and mention a third\n (4).\n I will discuss Sapaṇ’s view of\n (8)\n in the section on the Sage’s Intent. These are\ninteresting in themselves, and should be sufficient to introduce\nSapaṇ’s argumentative style and his philosophical approach\nin this work. I have taken extra space for this section of the entry\nto present\n (7),\n which is one of Sapaṇ’s most important arguments, and to\ndiscuss the work’s important, repeating defense of moral\ncontextualism. \n One point with which Sapaṇ opens the Three Vows provides\nan elegant paradigm for what he means by the title’s\n“Clear Differentiation” of the three vows, or\n codes.[11] \nIt is a case where Tibetans of his day have “mixed” the\nDisciples’ vows with the Great Vehicle’s bodhisattva vows.\nNow, it is clear that Tibetans undertaking monastic vows had commonly\npaired the oral recitation that constitutes the adoption of monastic\nvows with a mental component, the generation of a Great Vehicle\nintention called bodhicitta—the altruistic desire to\nachieve Buddhahood in order to save all beings from \n suffering.[12] \nSapaṇ voices no complaint about this pairing of mental and\nphysical actions, but he rejects a mistaken conclusion about the\nduration of the vows that some of his contemporaries apparently\nderived from it. \nSapaṇ argues that Disciples’ vows (i.e., monastic vows)\nlast until death (when one’s body dies), whereas the bodhisattva\nvows last beyond death, through subsequent rebirths—as long as\none’s mind persists. A counter-argument proposes that, if the\naltruistic intention is in place when they are recited, the\nDisciples’ vows should also continue for as long as one’s\nmind\n persists.[13]\n In reply, Sapaṇ says that this contradicts authoritative texts\nthat distinguish between the different rites and rules for upholding\nthe Disciples’ and Great Vehicle\n vows.[14]\n Furthermore, he says, if monastic vows lasted from life to life, then\ngods and babies who were reborn from the mental continua of deceased\nmonks would still be monks. Yet not only are such beings violating the\nrules of monkhood all the time, they are expressly forbidden from\nbecoming monks! Here we see a widespread mixture of practices leading\nto an unacceptable doctrinal confusion. \nThis may seem like a clever analysis without significant practical\nramifications. After all, I have no way of knowing whether I took a\nvow in a previous lifetime, and I cannot inform my future rebirth\nabout whether I have taken a vow in this life. But notice that the\nvows systems are distinguished by indicating the specific causes and\nresults on the path to liberation. Sapaṇ’s basic point is\nthat Disciples’ vows and Great Vehicle vows operate differently.\nThe practical benefit from such a “differentiation”, then,\nis the ability to articulate the different paths to liberation clearly\nand accurately. \nThis general concern with the operation of the paths leads, in the\nnext section, to a broader definition of\nkarma—action-and-result—and its associated terminology.\nSapaṇ begins with the crucial distinction between actions, which\nare produced and bring about happiness or pain as their result, and\nthe unconditioned, actionless, Realm of Reality or Dharmadhātu.\nSince wholesomeness is a quality of an action that is determined by\nthe happiness or pain that the action causes, he says, the causeless\nDharmadhātu is neither wholesome nor unwholesome. This\nconsequentialism about wholesomeness or virtue, set against a backdrop\nof an unchanging, literally “inconsequential” ultimate\nreality, launches the most extensive, detailed argument of the work:\nthe argument against the ultimate reality of virtue. \nLike other arguments in the Three Vows, Sapaṇ’s\ndisproof of the ultimate reality of virtue is a targeted critique of\nhis Tibetan\n contemporaries.[15]\n In this case, the discussion revolves around a verse from the\nVajradhvaja Sūtra, in which there is a dedication of all\nbeings’ virtue in the three times (the quote is something like,\n“as much as exists in the past, present and future”).\nOrdinarily, in the Great Vehicle, one altruistically dedicates\none’s virtue (or merit)—what we today euphemistically call\none’s “good karma”—to all beings, in the hope\nthat one’s own benefits will ripen in them. In this oft-cited\nscriptural passage, the speaker imaginatively maximizes this\nintention, and dedicates all the good karma in the universe, for all\ntime, toward this altruistic purpose. Some, Sapaṇ says,\nmistakenly consider this mass of virtue to be a thing,\nself-established and eternal, and they say that it is equivalent to\nthe “Sugata-matrix”, the unelaborated ultimate reality.\nWhat Sapaṇ believes, on the other hand, is that this idea that\nit is possible to dedicate ultimate reality—and that, since one\nonly dedicates wholesome karma, the Dharmadhātu is a kind of\n“existent virtue”—is an error that threatens an\nessential dharma teaching. \nOn the surface, then, the argument is a tussle over how to read a\npassage from scripture and its apparent, maximal dedication of merit.\nSince the scripture contains the words to recite that enact the\nbodhisattva vow, it is important from a ritual perspective that one\nunderstand the intention behind it. After all, as he argues, the\nmental intention is the true agent for the engagement of a vow. This\nin itself would be enough to make the issue soteriologically\nsignificant. But what merits extensive treatment is that the idea of\n“existent virtue” violates a consistent norm in\nSapaṇ’s writings, which is the strict separation between\nconventional and ultimate reality. We have seen this emphasis in his\napproaches to epistemology and will see it in the doctrine of\nemptiness as well, but here we see the practical, ritual-cum-ethical\napplication of this stance. \nSapaṇ begins the argument by quoting a wide range of\nauthoritative sources to show that the “Sugata-matrix” is\nunchanging, that it is equivalent to the Dharmadhātu and the\nTathāgata-nature, and that these are all completely devoid of\nevil and virtue, which are illusory\n constructions.[16]\n Near the end of the passage Sapaṇ recommends that the reader\nstudy, in particular, the Dharmodgata chapter of the Perfection of\nWisdom in 8,000 Lines (I.137; Rhoton 2002: 58). That chapter\nteaches that suchness, Tathāgata and emptiness are all the same,\nwhich is to say they are immobile and unproduced, unrelated to all\nnumbers (including one), unrelated to all concepts whatsoever, and yet\ngreater than—infinitely beyond—anything conceivable. If\nthe Dharmadhātu thus described does not change, it cannot go from\nbeing undedicated to dedicated; which means that you cannot dedicate\nit. Sapaṇ writes that the Vajradhvaja\nSūtra’s expressions “as much as” and\n“exists” (from “as much as exists in the past,\npresent and future”) could not possibly refer to the\nDharmadhātu: “As much as” appeals to the rejected\nidea of number, and, as he cites many sources to show, it is false to\nsay of the ultimate that it either “exists” or “does\nnot exist”. Based on scripture alone, then, this passage could\nnot imply the dedication of the Dharmadhātu. The passage is just\nsaying that we dedicate the actions (the karma) of\nall beings—just, whatever virtuous actions beings perform. This\nkeeps the dedication ritual firmly in the realm of conventional,\nchanging, illusory, reality. \nSapaṇ cites the possibility that the basis for the idea of\n“existent virtue” is the Abhidharmasamuccaya of\nAsaṅga, which does call the Dharmadhātu\n“virtue”, distinguishing it from the evils of cyclic\nexistence, and using terms such as “natural virtue” and\n“absolute virtue”. Sapaṇ considers this passage\nmerely figurative. It is like calling people whose hunger is sated,\n“desireless”—when of course they still have other\ndesires. To call the Dharmadhātu “virtue” is only to\nrefer to the absence of evil—to emptiness itself. But the\nDharmadhātu is not itself the cause of well-being, which\nis how virtue was defined. If the Dharmadhātu caused\nwell-being, all actions would be virtuous, since all things are\ncontained within it. Sapaṇ gives a similarly figurative reading\nto the Uttaratantra’s discussion of an innately\nexistent Buddhahood; it cannot mean this literally, he says,\nsince otherwise it would be affirming a non-Buddhist belief in an\neternal soul. \nUltimate reality’s numberless freedom from conceptual\nelaborations is, needless to say, a difficult idea to fathom. After\nall, we could only fathom it by means of concepts. But the notion\nallows Sapaṇ to reject a number of intermediate proposals, such\nas the notion that perhaps the dedicatable Sugata-matrix refers only\nto the animate portion of the Dharmadhātu. As he\nreplies, there are no distinctions and hence no “portions”\nin the Dharmadhātu! That’s what it means to say that it is\nfree of elaborations. \nThese considerations bring Sapaṇ to some profound analyses that\nsubtly divide the conceivable, causal reality from the inconceivable,\nand push the reader to contemplate his deeper message. One of these is\nstimulated by an opponent’s proposal that even though\ntechnically you cannot dedicate the Dharmadhātu, perhaps\nthere is no harm in saying that you dedicate it. This may\nseem like an elegant appeal to the conventionality of conventional\nreality, and the general Buddhist emphasis on the intention or the\naspiration as the source and cause of virtue. Yet it is just here that\nSapaṇ shows his exacting requirement that there be no\n“mixing” of the Great Vehicle and Disciple’s paths:\n“That dedication is harmful. Because it involves the perception\nof an object, it will become a poisonous dedication” (I.111;\nRhoton 2002: 55). The point is that bodhisattvas have a different\nunderstanding of the dedicatory ritual than Disciples, rooted\nin the bodhisattva’s understanding that there is no real object\nthat can be dedicated. The compassion that motivates the\nbodhisattva’s dedication of merit is a universal, ultimate\ncompassion whose nature is inseparable from emptiness. To imagine that\nthe Dharmadhātu as an object is a (non-empty) and hence\n“dedicatable” thing is to turn a Great Vehicle concept\ninto an ordinary conceptual construction, and thereby poison the\naltruistic\n intention.[17] \nPerhaps the most important “practical” ethical result of\nthis discussion appears in Sapaṇ’s clear advocacy of moral\ncontextualism. Different systems of vows require different\nbehaviors—and yet within each system, these behaviors are\nmorally significant and genuinely beneficial or harmful. The fact that\nthere are some eighteen different systems of monastic vows, which\ndiffer among themselves about countless particulars, does not\nundermine the validity of each system on its own terms, and does not\nallow for impromptu mixing and matching. A resonant example\nSapaṇ cites is that whereas some systems consider the killing of\nan unborn fetus an instance of the taking of a human life, other\nsystems do not. But the taking of a human life is one of the principal\ndownfalls (pārājika), an irredeemable infraction of\nthe monastic vows that causes immediate expulsion. And presumably, if\nyou have violated your vows in this way, you cannot simply move to\nanother monastery where killing a fetus is not considered having taken\na human life. But more importantly, Sapaṇ explains that the\nvows, though they differ one from the other, are all approved by the\nBuddha as sets that serve the function of monastic vows, which is to\nprevent the vow-holder’s mind from straying into\ninfractions—like a fence around a field. Vows have morally\nconsequential effects upon the mind, and they consist in coherent,\nBuddha-approved systems. \nThe final argument from the Three Vows I will mention is in\nthe chapter on Mantra vows, but is clearly connected with the topics\nalready discussed here. One of the issues most important to\nSapaṇ—he lists it twice in the final summary lists of\nessential topics mentioned above, and he also treats it in the\nSage’s Intent—is the misuse of\nVajravārāhī (Vajra Sow) blessings as a\nsubstitute for Mantric initiation. This, he says, is not taught in any\nof the scriptures. You need a real initiation ritual to practice\nMantra—it’s as simple as that! You cannot substitute a\nblessing for an initiation. He calls the alterations in the dharma\n“the blessings of demons”—claiming not that his\ncontemporaries are demons, but that they have been deceived. \nWhat irks Sapaṇ the most, it would seem, is what he sees as an\nattempt to excuse carelessness by appealing to the fact that rituals\nare only conventional constructions. He concludes the point by saying\nthat all rites belong to conventional reality: Disciples,\nGreat Vehicle, and Mantra rites. If you accept any of the systems, you\nmust accept them in their entirety; you must do all, or\nnone. There is no option to make a distinction between\nessential and non-essential doctrines based on the distinction between\nconventional and ultimate. The ultimate simply does not enter into the\nconsideration of whether a rite or ritual—or, for that matter,\nany karma, any act—is\n appropriate.[18]\n The separate systems have each been handed down through valid\nlineages with their own integrity, valued and delimited\nalways by their conventional utility. The fact that\nthey are not ultimate is not an excuse to experiment or play fast and\nloose with the rituals and their interpretation. Everything that we\ncan do, everything that we can say, is only conventional; but that\nfact does not license the blurring of the lines between the effective,\nwell delineated paths taught by the Buddha that can lead us to\nliberation if we follow them with care. \nClarifying the Sage’s Intent (D. Jackson 2015) is a path text, of the\ngenre called Tenrim (bstan rim), “stages of the\ndoctrine”, which lays out in detail the practices and\naccomplishments for beings on the way from ordinary person to\nliberated Buddha. It is an elegant and comprehensive approach to the\npath of the bodhisattva, drawing from Indian sources—especially\nthe Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra and\nthe Abhidharmasamuccaya of Asaṅga. Sapaṇ makes\ncreative use of these sources in a variety of ways, and the work is a\ncomplex interplay of tradition and innovation. Yet for our purposes,\nthe most significant aspects of the work are not in his construction\nof the path or his characterizations of bodhisattva practice, but in a\nnumber of philosophical excurses. Unlike the Three Vows, the\nSage’s Intent is not primarily intended as a polemic\ntext; yet occasionally Sapaṇ feels it necessary to address\ncontroversial issues relevant to topics that arise in the course of\nhis descriptions of the bodhisattva path. \nAs before, it is not possible to work through all of\nSapaṇ’s significant arguments, so I will limit myself to a\ntopic that was among his most extensively debated positions, and which\nis an important theme in this work. The issue is the supposed\n“White Self-sufficient Remedy”, often translated\n“White Panacea”—a term used to describe the\nmeditation practice called “Great Seal” or\nMahāmudrā. Sapaṇ believes that this term for\nMahāmudrā represents a mistaken understanding of the\npractice, which transmutes a legitimate tantric practice into a\nmisleading and pernicious, fallacious\n doctrine.[19] \nIn order to understand why Sapaṇ finds the Self-sufficient\nRemedy doctrine particularly troubling, it will be useful to notice\nhow quintessentially it brings together so much that Sapaṇ\nconsiders wrong with Tibetan Buddhism of his day. Recall that\nSapaṇ’s distinctive philosophical view rests upon an\nunstinting categorical distinction between the conventional and\nultimate realities, and we have seen that this has important\nconsequences in his epistemology and his approach to the\ninterpretation of Buddhist ethics and the operation of karma. He often\ncriticizes an apparent knee-jerk decontextualization that others read\nout of the doctrine of emptiness. Sapaṇ reminds us, again and\nagain, that emptiness does not mean that nothing really\nmatters, or that everything goes. The view of emptiness does not wipe\naway the conventional. Ultimate reality not relativize all things\nto it. On the contrary, it requires that actions be deemed\nmeaningful or not, real or not, by virtue of their effectiveness and\nrelevance within specifiable contexts. This is Buddhist\ncontextualism. \nThe target of Sapaṇ’s attack, then, is the notion that,\nsimply by means of the direct apprehension of the nature of the mind\ncalled Mahāmudrā, one attains all of the accomplishments of\nthe path. This one attainment alone is a cure-all, a\n“self-sufficient remedy”. We can see immediately that this\nclaim for this practice challenges and undermines the importance of\nthe many doctrinal details, practices and contexts of the Buddhist\ntradition, paring it down to a single visionary experience. In\naddition, Sapaṇ considers this view a Tibetan invention, not\nattested in India, that resembles a famously rejected Chinese doctrine\nassociated with the monk Hvashang Mohoyen. The “White\nSelf-sufficient Remedy” is, he believes, an ignorant distortion\nof the dharma that leads to a nihilistic decline of the teachings.\nFurthermore, Sapaṇ considers the practice of Mahāmudrā\na tantric, not a general Mahāyāna practice, so he rejects\nthe non-tantric form of the teaching circulating in his day. There is\nreason to believe that this particular “mixing” of general\nGreat Vehicle and specific tantric practices in fact had an Indian\nprecedent, but Sapaṇ seems to have assumed that Indian adepts\nwould have prevented this as a mistake (see Mathes 2008). \nFrom a historical perspective, it is important to distinguish the\nconceptual implications of the Self-sufficient Remedy claim from its\nactual use. Not all adherents of the Self-sufficient Remedy view, most\nlikely followers of Gampopa, the founder of the Kagyu school of\nTibetan Buddhism, would have taught a practice that actually\ndispensed with all other rituals and meditations in favor of bare\nMahāmudrā practice. On the contrary, Gampopa’s famous\nfive-stage practice includes the cultivation of Mahāmudrā as\nthe fourth stage in a practice that also included: the generation of\nbodhicitta; deity visualization; guru devotion; and\ndedication of merit. Gampopa’s is not an instruction on\nabandoning all other aspects of the path. There were, apparently,\ndifferences of opinion even among the adherents of the Self-sufficient\nRemedy doctrine about whether this meant that Mahāmudrā on\nits own substituted for all other practices, or Mahāmudrā\nwas in some way ultimately, essentially, equivalent to all other\nattainments, as their culmination or their peak. If the latter were\nthe case, one might engage in many practices but from the ultimate\nperspective only reach attainment through Mahāmudrā. In the\nformer case—the proper target of Sapaṇ’s\ncritique—one should only even try to attain\nMahāmudrā. Some of Sapaṇ’s contemporaries\nunderstood the Remedy as Self-sufficient even to the point of saying\nthat the practitioner did not need to generate\nbodhicitta or dedicate the merit (D. Jackson 1990: 28). \nIn the Three Vows Sapaṇ provides a kind of abstract\ncriticism of the logic of calling a practice\n“self-sufficient” when it is part of a list of five. It is\nperhaps in response to this point that Padma Karpo, a defender of the\nKagyu, called Sapaṇ’s argument a “childish\ncriticism”, depicting it as merely a worry about the meanings of\nwords (D. Jackson 1990: 37). He says that if this is why it is faulty\nto say that Mahāmudrā is “singularly\nsufficient”, then it is also faulty to speak of the standard\ntantric practice as having the “two stages” of creation\nand completion—presumably, because those two stages also require\npreparatory bodhicitta generation and subsequent dedication.\nThis does seem to take down at least one, abstract and logical,\nreading of Sapaṇ’s argument. It portends to give credence\nto the (rather overblown) claim among Sapaṇ’s later\ncritics that he has read the Self-sufficient Remedy doctrine in bad\nfaith. \nBut Sapaṇ’s critique is not merely a matter of overly\nliteral numeric quibbles in the application of metaphors. In the\nThree Vows it is primarily a critique of the claim that a\nsingle practice can be causally effective, when in fact all\nattainments depend upon multiple causes. In the Sage’s\nIntent Sapaṇ is expansive and detailed in his rejection of\nmany, specific errors. He criticizes the practice’s\nadherents’ notion of resting in the mind as “original,\nunaltered and relaxed” (D. Jackson 2015: 492ff). If the mind\nwere simply enlightened in its “unaltered” state, he\nwrites, then the Buddha would never have needed to teach the dharma.\nSuch an ideal, he says, is similar to the non-Mahāyāna\ntraditions of Disciples and Solitary Buddhas, or even simple\nignorance. It cannot be a Mahāyāna path, he writes, if it\nfails to generate compassion and wisdom. He points out that study is\nnecessary to understand the proper target of a meditation on\nemptiness. If the Mahāmudrā is attempted without prior\ncultivation of merit and wisdom, he says, there is no way that simply\nsaying “I will meditatively cultivate\nnon-conceptualization” could be effective. \nThe point that links these various concerns is the overarching worry\nabout moral nihilism, which arises from the claim that all practices\ncan be reduced to one, combined with the unbridled confidence in\ncreative, doctrinal innovation. This allows the practitioner to forego\nthe long and difficult moral training of the bodhisattva in favor of\nan easy, but delusory, instantaneous quasi-attainment. For fear of\nprolixity, I will leave off from Sapaṇ’s argument, in\nwhich he employs his distinctive approach to the doctrine of emptiness\nand the two truths. Indeed, although Sapaṇ did not write any\nworks dedicated to the doctrine of emptiness, his view—that, in\nbrief, ultimate truth is beyond all conceptual elaboration—is an\nimportant contribution that deserves further study. Suffice it to say\nthat his view is tailor made to prevent both the conceptual\nreification of emptiness that he criticizes in the Treasury\nand the nihilism that he criticizes in the Sage’s\nIntent. \nPerhaps the most controversial aspect of Sapaṇ’s critique\nin the Sage’s Intent was his assimilation of the\nnon-tantric Mahāmudrā view to the doctrine of the famous\nChinese monk called Hvashang Mohoyen. Sapaṇ reiterates the story\ntold in the Testament of Ba (discovered among the textual\ntreasures at Dunhuang) that tells of how, during the imperial period,\nthe Chinese monk debated with, and was bested by, the Indian monk\nKamalaśīla. Mohoyen did not claim his view to be a\n“Self-sufficient Remedy”, but he did believe in an easy\npractice free of cognition that could, on its own, instantaneously\nproduce attainments. Sapaṇ has been criticized for being biased\nand historically uninformed, but modern scholarship has uncovered\nevidence of Chinese “Zen” sources for Tibetan views like\nthose he critiqued (D. Jackson 1990, D. Jackson 1994, Kapstein 2000:\n75–78 and van Schaik 2015: 175–182). \nIn the sections above, we have seen Sapaṇ criticize his\ncontemporaries for their mistaken views and practices, which he\nbelieved threatened the integrity and the effectiveness of the\nBuddha’s teachings. As a result of these writings, he was\nvalorized as a great scholar with deep mastery of Buddhist doctrine,\nbut he was also often criticized and sometimes lampooned for being\nstodgy, conservative, and self-satisfied. He certainly believed that\nhe had a clearer and more accurate view of the truth of the doctrine\nthan most Tibetans of his time. Yet he believed the reason he was\nsuperior was easy to explain: He had studied and internalized the vast\nintellectual traditions of India, the land of Buddhism’s source.\nHis learning provided him the means and the justification for\ndefending the dharma against other teachers whose understanding was,\nby comparison, spotty.  \nIn the Gateway to Learning (D. Jackson 1987 and Gold 2007),\nSapaṇ made his case for the importance of scholastic learning\nfor Tibetans, and provided a clear program of study so that anyone\nwith sufficient diligence could attain the expertise necessary to be a\ndefender of the dharma like himself.  The work is a rare example of a\nmedieval treatise on the goals and means of education, and it is\narticulated with philosophical precision from a Buddhist perspective\nand with a remarkable awareness of the social- and\nhistorical-locatedness of Tibet of Sapaṇ’s\ntime. The Gateway is divided into three chapters, each\ndedicated to a category of scholarly learning: composition,\nexposition, and debate. Over the course of these chapters, Sapaṇ\nprovides introductory sketches of and occasional excurses into the\ntopics that, in his view, make up the model of Indian\npaṇḍityam and the most important practices of\nscholarship. The work draws upon the Vyākhyāyukti\nof Vasubandhu in the first two chapters and the\nVādanyāya of Dharmakīrti in the debate\nchapter, and roughly follows an outline from the\nMahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra, but it\nis unique in its scope, its Buddhist philosophical bent, and its\nselection of topics precisely targeted to the needs of Tibetans. \nAmong the most original and significant analyses here is\nSapaṇ’s approach to translation and translation theory. A\nkey theme of Tibetan Buddhist self-understanding has always been a\nkeen sense of Tibet’s proximity to India as the source of the\ndharma, but also its cultural and linguistic distance from India. This\nis a reason that the great translators (and of course,\npaṇḍitas) were venerated as a bridge to the\noriginal source of the dharma in Sanskrit. Sakya Paṇḍita\nwas himself a translator and he was very much aware of various kinds\nof shifts and transitions that took place when the dharma moved from\nSanskrit into Tibetan language. In the Gateway he explains\nthe choices made by the translators in a way that reveals just how\ndeep a Tibetan interpreter’s knowledge needs to be in order not\nto be fooled by the translations. It is, in this way, an early\napplication of the cultural studies approach to translation studies\n(see Bassnett & Lefevere 1999). In his analysis, the translations\nare shown to embody the cultural distance between India and Tibet,\nbetween the true dharma and its likely misinterpretation, which can\nonly be overcome by very precise linguistic expertise. \nOne example Sapaṇ notes is the use of the Tibetan translation\nye shes to distinguish the Sanskrit original\njñāna from prajñā. There is\nnothing in the source term to reflect the ye, which means,\nfor Sapan, that it is a mistake to think of ye shes as\n“primordial wisdom”—a common reading in certain\nTibetan schools. The dharma as translated is, in this way, a minefield\nof interpretive problems. It is very easy to make mistakes that can\nlead to false teachings. But it would be wrong to think that this\nlinguistic and cultural distance makes for an essential distinction\nbetween the dharma as it originated in its unadulterated form from the\nmouth of a Buddha, and the dharma as received by Tibetans. Such an\nessentialization would be to reify linguistic entities in a way that\nis non-Buddhist. The key to translation is not to uncover some\nessential nature of meanings embedded in the words. Sapaṇ\ntherefore provides a Buddhist philosophical defense of the possibility\nof translation. \nSapaṇ draws upon the epistemology of Dharmakirti discussed\nabove, and says that there is no essential relation between words and\nmeanings. Rather, meaning in language depends upon nothing but the\nspeaker’s intention, which is always context-dependent. In the\ncase of the dharma, that means the teacher’s intention to move a\nparticular set of beings forward on the path toward liberation. The\nkey in transmitting the teachings from generation to generation is to\npreserve, as well as possible, the capacity of the teachings to have\nthat effect. And the only way to do that is to preserve an\nunderstanding of the speaker’s specific intentions in\nusing language as expressed in the particular texts we have. Teachers\nhave to know just what the meaning was meant to be, when these words\nwere uttered. So, a detailed understanding of the language of the\ndharma—the contexts of its origination in the forms that we have\nit—is inseparable from the larger project of the sangha, to\ncommunicate the teachings from generation to generation. The\ntranslations, because they are vulnerable to misinterpretation,\nrequire special handling and expertise. Sapaṇ says we need a\ncommunity of experts to protect the teachings and preserve their\nproper interpretation. We need an interpretive community that can act\nas a bulwark against the decline of the dharma. Every aspect of the\nscholar’s toolbox—from elementary Sanskrit language study\nto literary theory to the regulation of debate methods—is\nprovided with an explanation and justification of the norms of this\nidealized Buddhist guard. \nIn the section on debate, Sapaṇ again explained a number of\npoints of particular interest to Tibetans of his time. Of great\ninterest here is his discussion of debate based on scripture, in which\nhe explains strategies for showing contradictions in the\nVedas while defending against critics who claim that the\nBuddhist scriptures are inconsistent. These instructions cohere with\nSapaṇ’s stated understanding that debate proper is a\ncompetition between adherents of different tenets. Of course, students\nmay practice debate to test their understanding of treatises, but the\nreal reason to engage in debate is to defend the dharma. Here we see\ndebate as a skill that is properly the culmination of the previous\ntrainings from Sanskrit language to poetics, all of which have as\ntheir ultimate aim to defend the Buddha’s dharma against its\nenemies, whether they be indirectly or unintentionally damaging it\nthrough misreadings and misrepresentations, or attacking it openly in\nthe promotion of non-Buddhist doctrines. Sapaṇ envisions\nTibetans training for a translocal courtly stage, where traditions\nlived or died by royal decree. Perhaps his own fame and skill as a\ndefender of the dharma contributed to Sakya’s attaining control\nover a united Tibet under Mongol rule.","contact.mail":"jcgold@princeton.edu","contact.domain":"princeton.edu"}]
