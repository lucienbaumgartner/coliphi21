It also highlights\nsome significant trends and important contributions made to this\nvenerable tradition by a number of Latin American philosophers.\n\n\nSkepticism is a philosophical activity of investigation characterized\nby the notion of suspension of judgment. Whereas dogmatists affirm or\ndeny a proposition on a given philosophical topic, skeptics neither\naffirm nor deny any proposition, i. e., they remain uncommitted to any\ndogmatic doctrine. According to skeptics, the basic opposition in\nphilosophy is that between those who endorse a philosophical theory\nand those who, after having inquired into the truth, did not find an\nanswer to the questions under examination. That is why skepticism came\nto be seen by dogmatic philosophers as a major challenge to their\nphilosophical project of finding the truth. Epistemologists and\nmetaphysicians alike set themselves the task of overcoming skepticism\nin order to establish their own doctrines. Thus, one constantly finds\ndogmatic philosophers trying to refute the skeptic. One criterion to\naccept a philosophical proposal is to determine to what extent it\novercomes the skeptical challenge.\n\n\nIn ancient times, skepticism had two main different forms: Pyrrhonism\nand Academic skepticism. Rediscovered in the Renaissance, skepticism\nbecame one of the pillars of modern philosophy, not only after modern\nskeptics, such as Michel de Montaigne, Pierre Bayle and David Hume,\ngave new impulse to it, but also because of the many answers to it\ndeveloped by philosophers such as Francis Bacon, René\nDescartes, George Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. In the analytic\ntradition, from G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell onwards, skepticism\nis a central topic of concern. This surprisingly long history shows\nnot only how deep is the skeptical challenge, but also how fascinating\nthe skeptical stance turns out to be.\n\n\nSimilarly to philosophers in many other parts of the world, Latin\nAmerican philosophers have faced skeptical challenges and have devoted\nclose attention to skepticism. They adopt, by and large, the same\nunderstanding of skepticism, share the same historical tradition, from\nPyrrho to contemporary analytic philosophy, that philosophers\nelsewhere have engaged with, and carry out the same kind of research\nas scholars all over the world do. What is specific about Latin\nAmerican scholars on skepticism is the fact that they are, in general,\nmore sympathetic toward skepticism than philosophers elsewhere tend to\nbe. Consequently, one finds not only studies on the history of\nskepticism and philosophical criticisms, but also developments of new\nforms of skepticism, which are worth considering with some care.\n\n\nIt may not be a mere coincidence that in 1991 Oswaldo Porchat, a\nleading Brazilian philosopher, and in 1994 Robert J. Fogelin coined\nthe word “neo-Pyrrhonism” to describe their respective\nphilosophical positions. That coincidence reflects both the increasing\nsignificance of the scholarship on skepticism, in Latin American and\nin Anglo-American philosophy, and a more sympathetic attitude toward\nthis venerable tradition. \nTo write about skepticism in Latin America is more difficult than one\nmay expect. First, the phenomena to be described are complex and\nmultifarious. Interest in skepticism is widespread in this part of the\nworld, and by no means confined to one country or to a small group of\nphilosophers. On the one hand, the significance of skepticism in the\nphilosophy of each country seems to vary wildly; on the other, the\nhistory of studies on skepticism in each country has its own internal\ndevelopment, despite many connections among the various countries\ninvolved. Second, interest in skepticism is so recent in Latin America\nthat not enough time has elapsed to provide some perspective on the\nissue. It is perhaps still too soon to give an entirely balanced view\nof skepticism in the region. But we will attempt our best to achieve\nthat. \nAn interesting feature of the Latin American way of approaching\nskepticism is by not taking it just as the embodiment of an opponent\nto be refuted. At the very least, there is not a widespread prejudice\nagainst skepticism. On the contrary, many Latin American philosophers\nhave strong sympathy for the skeptical proposal, and even those who\nare not skeptics themselves do not think that if the assumption of a\nphilosophical thesis leads to skepticism, this constitutes a kind of\nreductio ad absurdum of the initial assumption. Skepticism\nis, for many Latin American philosophers, at least a prima\nfacie tenable position. That does not mean, of course, that the\nmajority of those Latin American philosophers who deal with skepticism\nare skeptics, but we do find many that consider themselves as such.\nEven for those who are not skeptics, the significance of philosophical\nskepticism is undeniable, and Latin American philosophers have made\nefforts to understand carefully its meaning and historical role. \nThe best way to introduce skepticism in Latin America is not to\nexplain what goes on in each country, but to report what Latin\nAmerican philosophers have said concerning those topics that caught\ntheir attention. However, we will begin by presenting a brief\nhistorical background and the thought of the two founding fathers of\nLatin American work on skepticism: Oswaldo Porchat (Brazil) and\nEzequiel de Olaso (Argentina). Special care must be taken with their\nwork, because together they set the stage for a proper understanding\nof what happens in all other Latin American countries. We will then\nexamine what Latin American philosophers have been doing both in\ncontemporary skepticism and in the history of this philosophical\ntradition. Ours is not an exhaustive account, and being selective, it\nis unable to accommodate every proposal in the field. We hope,\nhowever, to give a fair idea of what has happened and is currently\ntaking place, in order to situate the reader and prompt additional\nresearch in the area. \nContemporary studies of skepticism began in Latin America thanks to\nthe works of Oswaldo Porchat and Ezequiel de Olaso, a distinguished\nArgentinian historian of philosophy. Due to their works, skepticism\nhas attracted a significant, although somewhat scattered, amount of\nattention in Latin America. Both were already interested in skepticism\nbefore they met for the first time. In 1968, Porchat gave a famous\nlecture, published in the following year, in which he called attention\nto a basic skeptical problem that every philosopher should try to\novercome: the problem of the conflict of philosophies (roughly, the\nfact that philosophical doctrines often disagree on their answers to\nany given philosophical question). Given his B.A. in classics and his\nPh.D. dissertation on Aristotle’s conception of science, it is\nnot surprising that Porchat came to know ancient skepticism very well.\nHis perspective was philosophical, and he identified his own\nphilosophical experience with that of the ancient skeptics. In the\nsame year of 1969, Olaso defended his Ph.D. dissertation on\n“Leibniz and the Ancient Skeptics” at Byrn Mawr College\n(Pennsylvania), in which he showed that Leibniz had a deep knowledge\nof Greek skepticism, whose modes he clearly identified in the\nCartesian arguments. Thus, one can say that skepticism in Latin\nAmerican began in the end of the 1960s. \nIn 1975, invited by Porchat, Olaso went to Brazil where he became a\nprofessor at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) until 1977.\nThis fact had a profound influence on the development of the studies\nof skepticism in both countries and even in other Latin American\ncountries. Their mutual collaboration proved very fruitful.\nPhilosophers interested on skepticism soon got in touch, for they\norganized seminal conferences on the topic (1986, in Campinas, Brazil;\nin 1992, in Buenos Aires, Argentina; unfortunately, no proceedings\nwere published). Throughout the years, many other conferences on\nskepticism were held (in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico) in which\nphilosophers from many countries took part and collective books on\nskepticism appeared. \nPorchat’s and Olaso’s influence was huge. They were the\nfounding fathers of skepticism in Latin America. One can speak of a\nsecond generation that was in touch from the 1990s onwards because\nthey paved the way first. Philosophers in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,\nand Colombia have been collaborating in the last twenty years because\nthey both inaugurated a friendly, collaborative way of doing\nphilosophy that has been preserved by their followers. Though Olaso,\nPorchat and some of their disciples were in touch with many\nphilosophers from other countries and had a far-reaching influence,\nthere is no single, integrated explanation for that widespread\ninterest. \nThere is no doubt that skepticism flourished in Brazil like in no\nother Latin American country. It is perhaps not amiss to say that\nPorchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism is the most important achievement of\nLatin American skepticism, providing material for further systematic\ndiscussions. In Brazil, an important group of philosophers around\nPorchat was organized throughout the country in the 1980s, and they\nwere devoted not only to understand the history of skepticism but also\nto discuss contemporary skepticism, by developing it and criticizing\nit. The group held conferences every year, sometimes twice a year, and\nmany books, individual monographs and edited collections, were\npublished. Moreover, Porchat was professor and supervisor of a number\nof young philosophers as well as a reference to all other philosophers\nstudying skepticism. Even philosophers who were not primarily\ninterested in skepticism found the group’s way of doing\nphilosophy quite attractive. In fact, the group has always\nsystematically invited non-skeptical philosophers to enrich its\ndiscussions. As a result, as time went by, the group grew larger and\nlarger. \nArgentina, Mexico, and Colombia have also shown a lot of interest in\nskepticism with many important contributions to it, albeit perhaps not\nas systematically as in Brazil. In Argentina, work on skepticism\nremained at first somewhat confined to Olaso and to some historians of\nmodern philosophy around him. Later, there has been a growing interest\nin Argentina, this time from philosophers belonging to the analytic\ntradition, who were (and still are) also in touch with the Brazilian\ngroup, including, more recently, a new impulse to the study of ancient\nskepticism. \nIn Mexico, there is also a deep interest in skepticism. History of\nskepticism was not neglected, as we can be seen from the works of\nLaura Benítez and José Antonio Robles, among others,\nboth of whom worked with Olaso (and Popkin). Their focus is on modern\nskepticism. Some Mexican philosophers, working within a Kantian\ntradition, focused on transcendental arguments as weapons against\nskepticism. Others work on contemporary skepticism in connection to\nquestions such as disjunctivism and perception. Finally, skepticism\nand its connections to fallibilism and skeptical or epistemic\nconcepts, such as doubt and certainty, were a major\ntheme of some Mexican philosophers. \nThere has also been some interest in skepticism in many other\ncountries, most notably in Colombia. Usually, this interest is\ncombined with a classic author, such as Descartes, Hume, or Kant, or\nwith an analytic philosopher, like Wittgenstein or Dennett. More\nrecently, an interest in ancient skepticism has also arisen. In other\ncountries such as Peru, Chile and Uruguay, the interest in skeptical\nissues is more scattered. No more than a minor or incidental interest\nin either the history of skepticism or in current epistemological\nquestions that bear on the skeptical challenge is found. \nThe study and diffusion of skepticism in Argentina and in other\ncountries such as Brazil and Mexico owes a great deal to Ezequiel de\nOlaso. When Olaso died, Porchat noted that, despite not being a\nskeptic himself, Olaso “was indeed the father of Brazilian\nskepticism” (Porchat 1997). But his leadership and influence was\nvast, as Popkin testified: \nEzequiel de Olaso was one of the most prominent historians of\nphilosophy. He contributed enormously to arousing interest in a wide\nrange of topics in the history of philosophy through his writings, his\nteachings and his lectures in Latin America, North America and Europe.\n(Popkin 1997) \nOlaso taught in many universities both in Argentina and elsewhere. His\nPh.D. dissertation has not been published, but many papers resulted\nfrom it. Olaso wrote a number of important papers on skepticism, both\nancient and modern. He explored many authors in the 17th\nand 18th centuries: Hume, Benito Jerónimo\nFeijóo, Rousseau, Hobbes, and Leibniz. These developments were\nsummarized in Olaso 1994. Many of his papers are dedicated to\nHume’s skepticism. Olaso argued that Hume was an Academic\nskeptic, not a Pyrrhonist, as Popkin had supposed. More importantly,\nhis study of certain Enlightenment authors made Popkin revise his\ninterpretation that, apart from Hume, there was no interest at all in\nskepticism during the 18th century. \nOlaso’s work was not limited to the presence of skepticism in\nmodern philosophy. He also devoted his efforts to interpret certain\nconcepts of the main lexicon of skepticism. He was not only interested\nin skepticism from a historical point of view, but also from a\nphilosophical perspective: he argued vigorously against the coherence\nof the skeptical position in “Zétesis” (Olaso 1988)\na detailed paper on ancient Pyrrhonism, in which he displayed both an\naccurate understanding of this philosophical stance and a highly\ncritical attitude toward the Pyrrhonian conception of investigation.\nHis assessment of the concept of zétesis was very\ninfluential. Olaso interpreted it as an inquiry whose goal was\nsuspension of judgment, which defined Pyrrhonism, and contrasted it to\nthe open inquiry led by Academic and modern skeptics, whose goal is\ntruth. Among his contributions, one finds also the distinction between\nthe concept of doubt, or suspension of the mind, and the\nconcept of epokhé, or suspension of judgment, which\nwould be the proper attitude of a skeptic, because it is beyond doubt\nitself and tries to overcome it. These new interpretations were part\nof his debate with scholars like Naess, Chisholm, Mates, Frede and, of\ncourse, Porchat in order to find an acceptable form of contemporary\nskepticism. Based on Ortega y Gasset’s distinction between\nbelief and knowledge, he proposed new accounts of Moore’s\nnotions of common sense and certainty (Olaso 1975a) and the critical\nanalysis carried out by Wittgenstein (Olaso 1999). \nOlaso’s work on skepticism opened up two main directions that\nwere followed by many philosophers, whether under his direct influence\nor not. First, skepticism emerged as an epistemological problem and,\nin the light of the linguistic turn, he set the task of reinterpreting\nand making sense of this philosophical stance. Second, he initiated a\nscholarly investigation of the history of skepticism; particularly of\nmodern skepticism, but also both versions of its ancient form. \nIt is now time to present in some detail Porchat’s\nneo-Pyrrhonism, for it is arguably the most important contribution to\nLatin American skepticism. His seminal paper, “On What\nAppears”, was published in 1991, laying the foundations and the\noutline of his skeptical stance. Later, in a number of papers, he\nexplored the main ideas further, corrected minor points, developed new\naspects, and wrote some introductory and accessible texts. \nOne of the merits of Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism is that it\nprovides a general, articulated philosophical stance that one can\nadopt. Skepticism is not, as it is usually presented in\nepistemological circles, a mere doubt on this or that topic that\nshould be superseded, that is, it is not a methodological doubt or an\nexpedient to strengthen a dogmatic position. For most philosophers\nconcerned with skepticism, the coherence and intelligibility of the\nskeptical position is not really important. Any doubt, however crazy, may be useful, if it allows the philosopher to learn something about\nan argument. But Porchat does not think so. For him, skepticism is\nthought of as an articulated, plausible stance proposed by some\nphilosophers. Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism is not even confined to a\nbroad epistemological doctrine, since it is meant to be a general\nphilosophical attitude, which includes epistemological aspects, but is\nnot restricted to them. \nOne should also emphasize that his neo-Pyrrhonism has to be sharply\ndistinguished from Cartesian skepticism. Porchat makes it clear that\nneo-Pyrrhonian aporiai are a different sort of argument from\nCartesian doubts. In particular, neo-Pyrrhonism is not committed to\nmentalism (the doctrine that one can conceive the mind, and its\nrepresentations, as independent from the body) and does not it invite\nany sort of solipsism. Thus, most of the criticisms leveled against\nCartesian skepticism do not apply to neo-Pyrrhonism. \nNeo-Pyrrhonism has two parts: one negative, and the other positive.\nThe two most important concepts of the negative part are\ndiaphonía (the conflict among the various\nphilosophical doctrines) and epokhé (the suspension of\njudgment). For Porchat, ataraxía, or tranquility of\nmind, is not an essential ingredient of Pyrrhonism and it is more of\nhistorical interest. Given the conflict of philosophies, Porchat draws\nthe skeptical conclusion: being genuinely unable to choose between the\nvarious philosophical views, he suspends his judgment. He argues\nvigorously that the disagreement between philosophies is undecidable.\nNot even his previous “philosophy of the common view of the\nworld” (Porchat 1975, 1979) is able to solve or avoid the\nconflict. The conflict involves the dogmatism not only of philosophers\nof the common view of the world, but also of ordinary people. However,\nnot all philosophies are part of the conflict, since some philosophies\nare not dogmatic: they do not intend to describe the ultimate nature\nof things. \nPorchat (1993) distinguishes between two kinds of skeptical arguments:\ndialectical and empirical. This is a significant contribution of\nPorchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism to skepticism. Let us consider, first,\ndialectical arguments. The mode of diaphonía, in\nPorchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism, is the crucial one. But, of course,\nPorchat also considers the other modes of Agrippa as important\nskeptical weapons against dogmatism. More importantly, he recognizes\nthat for ancient Pyrrhonism the skeptical method of antinomies\n(arguing both pro and con with equal persuasiveness) is indispensable\nagainst the dogmatic claim that some doctrines and arguments are\nfelt stronger than others. That is, the method is\nindispensable to neutralize that dogmatic experience of unbalanced\narguments, by making stronger the weaker arguments. By arguing on both\nsides of an issue, the skeptic experiences them as being equally\nstrong. Why do they seem equally powerful in the skeptic’s\nintellectual experience? For the following reason: any criterion\nproposed to decide the issue will itself be part of the dispute, and\ndisagreement about it re-emerges. Skeptics do not commit themselves to\nthese dialectical arguments. They just use what dogmatists admit\nagainst dogmatism. Their whole point is to induce suspension of\njudgment in dogmatists while still maintaining their own\nepokhé. \nThere is, however, another route toward suspension of judgment.\nSkeptics can employ arguments they are able to endorse, which lead to\nthe conclusion that one ought to suspend judgment. As skeptics\n(Pyrrhonists) live their ordinary life like everyone else, they can\nalso reason like everyone else. They can search for the conjunction of\nphenomena in the world, establish empirical correlations, and infer\nthe presence of fire from the fact of smoke or the occurrence of a\nwound from the presence of a scar. Empirical reasoning leads us from\none phenomenon to another. Couldn’t it be the case that such\nempirical arguments lead to suspension of judgment? These arguments\nhave as premises what is apparent, and they do not indicate a\nconclusion beyond the phenomena, since epokhé, their\nconclusion, is an intellectual experience. According to Porchat\n(1993), Aenesidemus’ modes are empirical, not dialectical,\narguments in support of epokhé. \nWith regard to the positive part, neo-Pyrrhonism presents a detailed\naccount of the crucial notion of phainómenon. Porchat\nthought, in an earlier phase, that phainómenon was to\nbe identified with, or assimilated to, phantasía\n(Porchat 1985, 1986). That explains why he once construed that notion\nas implying some form of mentalism: what appears was conceived of as a\nmental representation. He later rejected that identification (Porchat\n1991). On his new explanation, phainómenon is best\naccounted for by another crucial notion: bíos, or\ncommon life. After all, says Sextus Empiricus, what appears is\nbíos. Thus, Sextus’ explanation of the skeptical\nstandard of action is also an explanation of the notion of\nphainómenon. By paying close attention to the fourfold\neveryday observances, one may understand better what the\nphainómenon is. At the same time, common life is to be\nunderstood as what is apparent (what appears to those who live it),\nnot as a reality in itself. \nAccording to Porchat, phenomena are a kind of residue from suspension\nof judgment; they are what is left after we have suspended judgment\nabout dogmatic discourse. And once dogmatism is left behind, life is\nwhat is left for us. The phenomena impose themselves to us, and it is\nnot up to us to accept them or not. One could say that phenomenon is\nwhat is “given” to us, but that is misleading, for in one\nsense it is not “given” at all. At first, Porchat asserted\nthat language is a kind of constitutive ingredient of the phenomena\nand language permeates all our experience (Porchat 1991); later,\nperhaps to avoid some Kantian or idealist connotation, he preferred to\ntalk of an association between what appears and language (Porchat\n1995, 2013). Thus, phenomena are impregnated by language, not given to\nus. \nOne important comment Porchat makes concerning phenomena is that they\nare always relative to someone. In fact, they may be personal or\npublic. Something may appear to someone or to more than one person,\nmaybe even to all of us. For instance, it may appear to you right now\nthat your are reading this article; and it may appear to many of us\nthat Brasilia is the capital of Brazil; and it may appear to all of us\nthat there are trees in the world. Here it can be noted that there is\nno solipsistic tendency in neo-Pyrrhonism, since many people in fact\nshare most phenomena. That solipsism is not an inherent tendency in\nneo-Pyrrhonism can already be seen due to the connections between the\nphenomena and common life. After all, what is apparent to us are\nobjects and events in the world, part of the life all of us live. \nAnother remark is that phenomena are sensible or intellectual. When\nsomething appears to the senses, such as the perception of a table in\nfront of you, it is a sensible phenomenon; when it appears to the\nintellect, such as a law, it is an intellectual phenomenon. For\nPorchat, there is no sharp line between these two kinds of phenomena.\nA sensible phenomenon also has some intellectual aspect: when you see\na table in front of you, the very idea of a table includes in it\nsomething that goes beyond what is present in your sensory modalities.\nHowever, although Porchat does not develop this idea explicitly, most\nintellectual phenomena seem to have a reference to something sensible,\nor at least to have something sensible in its origin. Therefore, many\nphenomena are typically of one kind, always including both a sensible\nand an intellectual aspect in them. Very recently, however, Porchat\ndropped that doctrine, and he now prefers to distinguish between two\nkinds of phenomena (Porchat 2013). \nPorchat’s interpretation of Pyrrhonism seems closer to\nFrede’s (1997) than to Burnyeat’s (1980). It seems that,\nfor him just like for Frede, skeptics have many beliefs in ordinary\nlife, but are not committed to philosophical beliefs (beliefs about\nthe truth of various philosophical views about the world). His\nneo-Pyrrhonism, therefore, would seem to be an urbane form of\nskepticism (cf. Barnes 1992). However, the very distinction at the\nbasis of that dispute between Frede and Burnyeat presupposes what\nPorchat rejects: a contrast between philosophers and ordinary people.\nFrom a neo-Pyrrhonist point of view, both are typically, though not\nalways, dogmatists: most philosophers are dogmatists and so are\nordinary folk; dogmatic philosophers only tend to be more refined in\nsome of their conceptions. \nThe crucial distinction is that between dogmatism and non-dogmatism.\nSometimes, ordinary people are not dogmatic, and neither are some\nphilosophers, such the skeptics (Pyrrhonists). For Porchat, many\ncontemporary philosophers are skeptics or have a skeptical tendency\nwithout knowing it (Porchat 2001). Thus, what matters for a\nneo-Pyrrhonist is not whether the skeptic has no beliefs whatsoever or\nonly ordinary beliefs, but whether he has dogmatic beliefs (concerning\nádela) or non-dogmatic beliefs (concerning what\nappears, that is, the world or bíos). Frede would have\nmissed the point concerning the scope of epokhé for\nnot having understood properly the notion of\nphainómenon (Porchat 1991). \nAccordingly, the basic neo-Pyrrhonian distinction is that between the\nphenomena and what is said about the phenomena. Dogmatic discourse is\nabout the phenomena. When dogmatists say “roses are\nred” they mean “roses are really red”, and\nthey have a theory to explain what that alleged reality consists in.\nThus, they are no longer talking about the world, but about a further\nreality posited by their theory. No one disputes whether a rose\nappears red, but whether it is in fact red. Not all discourse,\nhowever, is about the phenomena and some merely expresses the\nphenomena. Such is ordinary language in daily life, and such is also\nthe use of language by neo-Pyrrhonists: they use language to express\nwhat appears to them (or to us, if the phenomenon is a common one),\nbut not to state how things really are. In this sense, “roses\nare red” expresses how roses appear to us; and in this sense,\nneo-Pyrrhonists may even say it is true that roses are red\nand that we know it. Therefore, neo-Pyrrhonism is not, in one\nsense of the word, a form of relativism, since it accepts an objective\nknowledge about the world. \nTwo other Pyrrhonian concepts are updated by the neo-Pyrrhonist in the\npositive part: haíresis and zétesis.\nAccording to Porchat, neo-Pyrrhonists have a doctrine or “a\nskeptical view of the world”. This skeptical view of the world\nis an elaboration of how things appear to neo-Pyrrhonists. Skeptical\ndiscourse should be understood as an expression of phenomena. Thus,\nneo-Pyrrhonists may articulate explicitly their own view of the world.\nSince most phenomena are common, especially those that concern\nphilosophical issues, neo-Pyrrhonists will try to make explicit our\nways of thinking, at least as they see them. However, each skeptic\nwill have his or her own skeptical view of the world, since this view\ndepends also on the circumstances in which they live. \nLastly, it should be noted that neo-Pyrrhonists are empiricists, but\ntheir empiricism is improved by current philosophy of science. For\ninstance, they may endorse the hypothetic-deductive method. For them,\nwe can explore the world empirically, and in their skeptical view of\nthe world they may incorporate scientific results. For instance, we\nthink that the earth moves, and we no longer think that the earth is\nat the center of the universe. Scientific results may and do have\nimportant impacts on our view of the world, including on the\nneo-Pyrrhonists’. Porchat went as far as to distinguish between\na philosophical realism and a scientific realism (Porchat 1991, 1994),\nasserting that neo-Pyrrhonists need not be instrumentalists, but could\nhold scientific realism, although not, of course, philosophical\nrealism. If there is objective knowledge of the common world, it seems\nthat the sciences can improve on that knowledge being guided by an\nexperimental method such as the hypothetic-deductive. Neo-Pyrrhonian\nzétesis is not only a philosophical inquiry to destroy\ndogmatism, as in the case of Sextus, but also an empirical exploration\nof the world of phenomena. \nNeo-Pyrrhonism provoked a lot of different reactions in Brazil and\nelsewhere. Since it is impossible to review them all here, our purpose\nwill be to give a fair idea of them. \nThe first important reaction came from philosophers concerned with\nscientific knowledge. Hilan Bensusan and Paulo Souza (1994) thought\nthat Pyrrhonism was an outdated philosophy. In the face of\ncontemporary science, Pyrrhonism would no longer be a viable\nalternative, for it had not the adequate concepts to explain that\nscience. Therefore, the fact that science has evolved in unforeseeable\nways is an objection to neo-Pyrrhonism. Luiz Henrique de Araújo\nDutra (1993, 1995, 1996, 1997b), also criticizing Porchat’s\nconception of science, came to propose another skeptical position,\nwhich he called “alethic skepticism”. Dutra thought that\nthe metaphysical notion of truth is indispensable to scientific\nresearch. Both held that modern science establishes theories that\ncannot be doubted by the neo-Pyrrhonist. Otávio Bueno has a\nmore sympathetic proposal toward skepticism and develops a\nneo-Pyrrhonist approach to contemporary science by combining it with\nvan Fraassen’s view (Bueno 2015). Neo-Pyrrhonian empiricism\nemphasizes the notion of empirical adequacy. \nA second kind of response was given by those who want to develop or\nimprove on basic features of neo-Pyrrhonism. Some, such as\nPlínio Junqueira Smith (1995b), tried to purify neo-Pyrrhonism\nfrom what still looked like a dogmatic notion. For instance, the idea\nthat dogmatism is a disease and that the skeptic (Pyrrhonist) offers a\nbetter way of life by curing dogmatists of their disease may be mere\nprejudice. Therefore, the skeptical idea of therapy is perhaps\ndogmatic. The notion of common life as used by the neo-Pyrrhonist also\nseems to be an inheritance of Porchat’s “philosophy of the\ncommon view of the world” (Porchat 1975, 1979). The skeptical\nview of the world has an undeniable personal aspect. Waldomiro\nJosé da Silva Filho explored, on the one hand, skeptical\ndifficulties in common life neglected by the neo-Pyrrhonist (Silva\nFilho 2015) and, on the other, difficulties in self-knowledge, thereby\ntrying to extend neo-Pyrrhonism to subjects not touched upon by\nPorchat (Silva Filho 2007, 2008). \nAnother important discussion intended to correct and improve on\nneo-Pyrrhonism concerns the neo-Pyrrhonist view on truth. Porchat\ndeveloped in an important paper a skeptical doctrine of truth (Porchat\n1995). According to Porchat, once they have divorced from a\nmetaphysical notion of reality, neo-Pyrrhonists can defend a\ncorrespondence theory of truth: what we say and what appears would be\ncorrelated in our experience; it appears that there is a link between\nwhat we say and what appears to us. Eduardo Barrio (2000), however,\nthinks that the only alternative to a neo-Pyrrhonist is to adopt a\ndeflationist theory of truth, like the redundancy theory, and that any\ncorrespondence theory would imply dogmatism. \nAn unexpected and important development of neo-Pyrrhonism came from\nphilosophers who were also concerned with political philosophy. They\nwere interested in knowing what would be the skeptical (Pyrrhonian)\nproposal in politics. Porchat (in conversation) has always been very\nclear on this issue, for he holds that the skeptic could have any\npolitical doctrine, including a radical one: from extreme right to\nextreme left. After all, skepticism would not exclude any content of\nphainomena. But most think that not all alternatives are\naccessible to a skeptical position. Renato Lessa (1995) argues that\nthe neo-Pyrrhonist would be a liberal; Paulo Jonas de Lima Piva (2002)\nthinks he could be a social democrat or a socialist; Cicero\nRomão Araújo (2007, 2008) connects the notion of\nskepticism with the notion of citizenship. This debate opened up a new\nline of research concerning skepticism. \nVery recently, an internal criticism of neo-Pyrrhonism emerged and it\ndeserves to be mentioned. Vitor Hirschbruch Schvartz (2015) and Diego\nMachuca (2013a) argue for a rustic version of neo-Pyrrhonism,\naccording to which Pyrrhonists hold no beliefs, and do not stop short\nof all the consequences that one should derive from the force of the\nskeptical attack on dogmatism. A truly skeptical position would\ndestroy all beliefs, whether ordinary or philosophical. Accordingly,\nSchvartz and Machuca see themselves as rustic neo-Pyrrhonists, and do\nnot accept Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism with its non-dogmatic\nbeliefs. \nBut there have been many external criticisms whose intention is to\nreject neo-Pyrrhonism. Roberto Bolzani Filho developed an incisive\ncriticism of Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism. Bolzani (1996, 2003)\nidentified a sort of “naturalized reason” or some dogmatic\npresuppositions in the idea of a “healthy philosophy” in\nPorchat’s thinking. One could apply to skepticism the same kind\nof argument that the skeptic uses against other philosophies. In the\nend, skepticism would be part of the conflict among philosophies it\ntries to avoid. Bolzani also attempted to show that, despite\nPorchat’s intention, neo-Pyrrhonism is an outdated way of\nphilosophizing. Roberto Horácio de Sá Pereira (2003)\npresented a Kantian answer to Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism. He\nraised a number of difficulties to understand Porchat’s\nconception of phenomena, and argued that an acceptable solution would\ncome only from a transcendental philosophy. These two criticisms, if\nsound, should make one reconsider neo-Pyrrhonism. More recently,\nPereira (2015) came to defend naive realism against Pyrrhonism. \nJust as in many other parts of the world, contemporary skepticism in\nLatin America deals with epistemological issues within analytic theory\nof knowledge. Many anti-skeptical strategies, such as contextualism\nand externalism, deserved close scrutiny by Latin American\nphilosophers. Also the transcendental strategy has captured the\nattention of many philosophers interested in skepticism. But\ncontemporary skepticism is not confined to epistemology alone and it\nengages with, more broadly, analytic philosophy as a whole. Analytic\nworries about language and, more specifically, the notion of meaning\nhave led to the development of a new form of skepticism, known as\nmeaning skepticism. We will review some of the discussions on these\ntopics, beginning with the connections between skepticism and analytic\nphilosophy. \nDanilo Marcondes de Souza Filho (Brazil) developed some skeptical\nconcepts using Austin’s pragmatist view of language, and he also\nidentified many common ideas between Wittgenstein and Pyrrhonism\n(Marcondes de Souza Filho 1988, 1996a,b). Thus, Marcondes was\narticulating Pyrrhonism further in a similar spirit as Porchat.\nAnother groundbreaking work on skepticism derived from the linguistic\nturn is that of Samuel Cabanchik (Argentina). Cabanchik was interested\nin the possibility of a linguistic form of skepticism or skepticism\nabout meaning not only in Wittgenstein, but also in Aristotle and\nFrancisco Sanchez. His main focus, however, was Wittgenstein, about\nwhom he wrote two books (2003, 2010) and many papers (1990,\n2008a,b). \nMarcondes’ and Cabanchik’s concern with analytic\nphilosophy and its relation to skepticism was truly a guide to other\nphilosophers. The connections between skepticism and the philosophy of\nthe later Wittgenstein have been highlighted by many scholars.\nPlínio Junqueira Smith (1994) tried to show the strong\naffinities between Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and ancient\nPyrrhonism, to which Paulo Roberto Margutti (Brazil) (Pinto 1996a)\noffered a criticism. In the same spirit, Guadalupe Reinoso (Argentina)\n(2006, 2008, 2009) calls our attention to the value of skepticism in\nboth Sextus and Wittgenstein as an ars vivendi: their\ncriticism of language’s bewitchment, anti-theoretical\nperspective, and conception of philosophy as a therapy. Magdalena\nHolguín (Colombia) (1997) and R. Meléndez (Colombia)\n(2014) also analyze the relations between skepticism and Wittgenstein.\nPamela Lastres (Peru) (2011) has recently been doing some promising\nwork on Wittgenstein and Moore, but also on Pyrrhonian skepticism. It\nis also worth noting that Oscar Nudler (Argentina) (2010) has\ndeveloped what he calls a “philosophy of the limits”,\ninspired both by Wittgenstein and the Socratic awareness of our\nignorance, which, although not properly skeptic, is a doctrine at\nleast closely associated with skepticism. \nMore recently, Glenda Satne (Argentina) (2003, 2005a,b, 2008) also\npursued a line of research based on analytic theories of meaning and,\nmore specifically, on meaning skepticism. She has been busy with\nskeptical arguments derived from contemporary semantics, such as\nQuine’s argument from the indeterminacy of radical translation,\nPutnam’s model-theoretic argument, Dummett’s argument from\nthe manifestation of linguistic knowledge and, above all,\nKripke’s (or Kripkenstein’s) skeptical arguments. Meaning\nskepticism was also the subject of a very well informed book by Silvio\nMota Pinto (Brazil/Mexico) (2009, 2014), and Efraín Lazos\n(Mexico) (2002) published interesting papers on Wittgenstein, Kripke,\nand meaning skepticism as well. \nThus, the connection between skepticism and analytic philosophy became\na topic to be further explored by Latin American philosophers. Porchat\nhad argued that contemporary analytic philosophy was to a good extent\nskeptical without knowing it. According to him, many analytic\nphilosophers don’t understand very well what skeptics had said\nand what they call a skeptic does not correspond to skepticism,\nproperly understood. If they had the appropriate knowledge of the\nhistory of skepticism, they would perhaps acknowledge the skeptical\norientation of their doctrines. It is not clear, however, that that is\nthe case in analytic philosophy. One debate that has received some\nattention is how far this or that analytic philosopher is close to\nskepticism. For instance, against Porchat’s opinion about Quine,\nMarcos Nascimento Bulcão (Brazil) wrote a book on Quine’s\nnaturalistic realism, denying that he is a skeptic (Bulcão\n2008). However, the perception of a skeptical Quine still persists in\nsome places. \nDavidson is another analytic philosopher whose connections to\nskepticism have been assessed by Latin American philosophers. Eleonora\nOrlando (Argentina) (2000) wrote a paper criticizing Davidson, for his\nconception of language would end up, despite his intentions, into a\nkind of semantic skepticism. Cristian Barturén (Peru), on the\nother hand, is interested on Davidson’s critique of global\nSkepticism. Otávio Bueno (Brazil/USA) criticized the way in\nwhich Davidson tries to respond to skepticism (Bueno 2005). \nThe relation between P.F. Strawson and skepticism has also been\nassessed by a number of Latin American scholars on contemporary\nskepticism or on analytic philosophy. Perhaps the most important\ncontribution comes from a Mexican group. We will talk more about them\nbelow, when we discuss transcendental arguments as an anti-skeptical\nstrategy. Sergio Sanchez (Argentina) (2006), Marco Franciotti (2009)\nand Plínio Junqueira Smith (2015) have also done some work in\nthis topic. \nOther analytic philosophers engaged with the issue further. To give\nbut one example, Miguel Ángel Fernández (Mexico) (2014)\ncriticized the incoherence of the anti-skeptical epistemology of\nbelief attribution developed by Crispin Wright. According to\nFernández, Wright intends to combine two desiderata in\na single anti-skeptical strategy, to wit, a concessive\nelement to the skeptic, on the one hand, and a rescue\nelement, on the other. However, he argues, that combination is\nimpossible. \nPerhaps one should note that contemporary skepticism was also\ndeveloped along other philosophical traditions, not only of an\nanalytic orientation. Under the influence of Wittgenstein, but also of\nStanley Cavell, Mario Gensollem (Mexico) (2006) explored the role of\nskepticism not only in philosophy, but also in common life. He came to\nembrace the Cavellian thesis that philosophical skepticism is the best\nexpression of the intrinsic finitude of human nature. Sergio\nSánchez (Argentina) (2006) called attention not only to\nStrawson’s but also to Heidegger’s assessment of skeptical\narguments. Jônadas Techio (Brazil) (2013) also investigated,\nfrom a Cavellian and Heideggerian points of view, the importance of\nphilosophical skepticism. \nSkeptical worries are usually linked to epistemological issues. We\nfind in Mexico a group of philosophers who have a very strong\nconnection to skepticism. They go as far as proposing new forms of\nskepticism. Armando Cíntora (Mexico) (2010), for instance,\nholds a Pyrrhonian position in philosophy of science. According to\nCíntora, a methodological Pyrrhonism would be of great help to\nliberate scientists from the dogmas that keep them captive when they\ntry to develop their scientific research. Just like in Sextus’\ncase, Cíntora argues that this kind of methodological\nPyrrhonism is not an epistemic paralysis: Pyrrhonian scientists can\npractice science, since they are aware of the non-dogmatic (temporal)\ncharacter of their ontological, methodological and semantic\nprinciples. Such acknowledgment will keep them safe from a dogmatic\noutlook. \nJorge Ornelas (Mexico) (2012, 2014a; Cíntora and Ornelas\n2013a), a younger member of that group, focused on the main\nanti-skeptical strategies in contemporary philosophy (contextualism,\nbelief-attribution epistemology, dogmatism, transcendental approach,\nexternalism, etc.). Ornelas tried to show that none of these\nstrategies succeed or dislodge the traditional skeptical challenge,\nchiefly because they lack a satisfactory diagnosis of the motivations\nbehind the skeptical problematic. Therefore, they fall prey to a\ndouble error: not only do they fail to eradicate the basic motivations\nbehind skepticism, but also they pay no attention to the fact that the\ntraditional skeptical problematic emerges only for theories and\nconcepts of knowledge that do not threaten ordinary knowledge\nattributions. \nFallibilism and skepticism were the topics of some papers written by\nGuillermo Hurtado (Mexico). Hurtado (2002a) holds that, although these\ntwo positions are closely related, one must keep them apart; he\nrejects fallibilism because it is revisionist. Not much later, he\nargues in favor of using more fine-grained epistemic terms. According\nto Hurtado (2005), one should distinguish various senses of\n“doubt”, introduce the notion of “suspicion”,\nand accept various degrees of certainty. His basic idea is to enrich\nthe vocabulary of epistemology, including more sophisticated skeptical\nterms. \nMany, of course, reject the skeptical position. Paulo Francisco\nEstrella Faria (Brazil) (2007, 2012), for instance, argued against\nskepticism. In fact, he thinks, skepticism is committed to a kind of\nidealism, even in the case of Porchat and despite his explicit\nrejection of this philosophical view. According to Faria, any\nassertion implies a claim to absolute truth and, if skeptics assert\nanything, as they do in ordinary life, then they are committed to what\nthey would rather avoid. The skeptic view of language is, therefore,\nuntenable, and there is a type of pragmatic contradiction in the\nskeptic’s position. That criticism has been endorsed by Roberto\nHorácio de Sá Pereira (Brazil) (2003, 2015). \nThe works of Eleonora Cresto (Argentina) and Alejandro Miroli\n(Argentina) also distance themselves from the skeptical position.\nCresto (1996, 1997) focused on anti-skeptical strategies that arise\nfrom naturalistic positions, whether along Wittgensteinian lines or\nfollowing F. Dretske and other reliabilists. Miroli (2007, 2008,\n2010), in turn, dealt with scientific skepticism, addressing both\ngeneral cases and socially important ones. He also examined\nDretske’s relevant alternatives argument, and tried to determine\nwhich kinds of alternatives one should exclude and which one can\nneglect in knowledge attributions. \nSeveral additional epistemological strategies were put under close\nscrutiny by Latin American epistemologists. Here are a few of them.\nDiana Hoyos (Colombia) (2006) works on contemporary theory of\nknowledge, linking the concepts of epistemic responsibility, Gettier\nexamples and skepticism. Jorge Gregorio Posada (Colombia) (2007) has\nresponded to her work. Ignacio Ávila (Colombia) (2003)\nconfronts Davidson’s thesis that most of our beliefs are true\nwith the corresponding skeptical challenge. Another popular\nanti-skeptical strategy is contextualism. Flávio Williges\n(Brazil) devoted his Ph.D. dissertation to that subject, from which\nresulted a paper (Williges 2013), and André Joffily Abath\n(Brazil) (2012) uses contextualism to refute Cartesian skepticism. \nAmong the anti-skeptical strategies, the one that invokes\ntranscendental considerations deserves special mention. A group of\nphilosophers in Mexico is the most distinguished one concerning this\nKantian-Strawsonian-inspired answer to skepticism. Pedro Stepanenko\n(Mexico) explored the anti-skeptical potential of the Kantian concept\nof the synthetic unity of apperception in many papers (2001, 2002a,\n2006, 2007, 2008). According to his interpretation, this unity should\nbe considered as the unity of our mental states that is possible only\nthrough the inferential relations to their contents. This unity makes\npossible the self-consciousness that any argumentative practice\nrequires. If we could suspend judgment with respect to any subject, we\nwould renounce to establish inferential relations among the contents\nof our mental states; in that case, there would be no consciousness\nunity, nor knowledge of our mental states. \nIn that same Kantian group, the works of Efraín Lazos\n(México) are outstanding. Lazos (2002, 2014) was able to\ncombine Kantian and Wittgensteinian anti-skepticism to produce new\nperspectives on the skeptical challenge. More recently, Lazos appealed\nto a transcendental strategy based on the works of Barry Stroud to\nshow the anti-skeptical force of transcendental arguments. Isabel\nCabrera (Mexico) (1999) edited a book on transcendental arguments, in\nwhich the force and limits of such arguments as tools against\nskepticism are assessed. Cabrera (2002) also worked out the relations\nbetween Buddhism and skepticism. In particular, she showed that both\nin Buddhism and in Humean skepticism there is an attack on the notion\nof substance, and that the lack of commitment to substances in\none’s understanding of the world has a therapeutic function,\nnamely, to avoid suffering. \nThe so-called Agrippan trilemma is an important argument for\ncontemporary skepticism. Some Latin American philosophers have tried\nto answer this deep, difficult skeptical challenge. José de\nTeresa (Mexico) (2000, 2013, 2014) developed an anti-skeptical\nstrategy inspired in Plato’s dialectic. According to de Teresa,\nPlato’s strategy is effective against the trilemma presented by\nthe skeptic, because it escapes the three alternatives under\nconsideration. \nAmong the Agrippan modes, however, the most important for Latin\nAmerican skepticism seems to be diaphonía or\ndisagreement. We saw how important it is to Porchat’s\nneo-Pyrrhonism (1969, 1991, 1993). Some efforts have recently been\nmade to compare the skeptical, Agrippan mode of\ndiaphonía to contemporary reflections on disagreement.\nOf particular importance is Diego Machuca’s (Argentina) (2013a)\nidea that diaphonía is different from disagreement.\nMachuca accuses contemporary epistemologists who defend that\ndisagreement leads to suspension of judgment of dogmatism. According\nto Machuca, they base their arguments on dogmatist principles to reach\nsuspension of judgment. It also deserves to be noted Otávio\nBueno’s (Brazil) defense of diaphonía from\nrecent attacks, such as Barnes’ criticism (Bueno 2013). Bueno\noffers an interpretation of diaphonía free from the\nproblems that arise from faulty interpretations. Perhaps this is\nanother topic in which one may discover some original contributions\nfrom Latin American skepticism. There has also been some efforts to\nextend the mode of disagreement in contemporary skepticism into\nlogical matters (Barrio 2015), as well as some discussion concerning\nevaluative judgments and the notion of relative truth (Orlando\n2014). \nThe history of skepticism has also attracted the attention of many\nscholars throughout Latin America. As in most places, historical\ninvestigation tended to concentrate in the modern period, mostly on\nCartesian and Humean skepticism, though many other authors, such as\nMontaigne, Bacon, Bayle, and Kant, were also on the spot. Although\nBrazilian scholarship has perhaps made more contributions, one should\nnot neglect the huge and widespread interest in modern skepticism\nthroughout Latin America. \nThe most important work on the history of skepticism is arguably that\nof José Raimundo Maia Neto (Brazil), who worked with Popkin.\nMaia Neto got interested in skepticism through his contact with Danilo\nMarcondes and, some time later, with Porchat’s works. His main\ncontribution is that Academic skepticism played a more important role\nin modern skepticism than Popkin’s interpretation recognizes\n(Maia Neto 1997a, 2005, 2013a). According to Maia Neto, Popkin\nemphasized the importance of Pyrrhonism for modern philosophy, but\nneglected the fact that Academic skepticism was also widely known and\nused by many philosophers. In order to defend this interpretation,\nMaia Neto wrote a number of papers on philosophers like Montaigne\n(Maia Neto 2004, 2012), Pierre Charron (Maia Neto 2014), Descartes\n(Maia Neto 2001), Gassendi (Maia Neto 1997b) and Pierre-Daniel Huet\n(Maia Neto 2008a,b). In fact, he explored the whole modern skepticism\nfrom Montaigne onwards, with important texts on Pascal (Maia Neto\n1995), Bayle (Maia Neto 1996), and Hume (Maia Neto 1991). \nAnother important contribution is that of Luiz Antonio Alves Eva\n(Brazil), who has studied in great detail Montaigne’s\nEssays, publishing two books (2004, 2007b) and a number of\npapers in Brazil and elsewhere (2001a, 2012, 2013a). Still in Brazil,\nRenato Lessa (Brazil) (1995, 2003) has done some work on\nMontaigne’s political skepticism, showing that skeptics, by\nacknowledging the role of habit, would be realists in politics. Smith\n(2012a), criticizing Eva’s interpretation, who insists on the\naffinities between Montaigne and ancient skeptics, tries to uncover\nmore differences. In Argentina, there has also been some work on\nMontaigne’s skepticism. In addition to Fernando Bahr\n(Argentina), to whom we shall return, Soledad Croce (Argentina) (2006,\n2007), for instance, has published many papers on what she takes as\nthe practical skepticism of Montaigne. \nLuiz Eva (Brazil) (2006, 2008, 2011) also focused on the relations\nbetween Francis Bacon and skepticism. He proposed some careful\ninterpretations of the Theory of the Idols and skeptical arguments\nstemming from ancient Pyrrhonism and from Montaigne and Sanchez. He\nshowed not only the skeptical origins of most Baconian idols, but also\nhow their structure changed the skeptical Modes, thereby revealing\nwhat is properly new in Bacon. Silvia Manzo (Argentina) (2009) wrote\non the same subject, holding a balanced view, in which there is a\ndouble attitude in light of the skeptical threat. More recently, she\nreturned to that topic (Manzo forthcoming), providing a reconstruction\nof Francis Bacon’s reception of Academic skepticism. She deals\nwith the assessment of ancient skepticism throughout Bacon’s\nwritings and argues that he, on the one hand, approved of the state of\ndoubt and the suspension of judgment and, on the other hand, rejected\nthe notion of acatalepsia. Plínio Junqueira Smith (Brazil)\n(2012b), referring to both scholars, showed that Bacon’s main\nfocus is on the propositions “nothing is known” and\n“nothing can be known”, to which he devoted careful\nattention. According to him, Bacon used skeptical weapons to reject\nthe whole traditional philosophy (including skepticism), not only to\ncriticize dogmatism, thereby distancing himself from it. \nDanilo Marcondes (Brazil) (2009, 2012) has been doing original,\nimportant research on the ancient Modes and the discovery of the New\nWorld. This discovery offered not only many more examples of the same\nkind of diversity Europeans were familiar with, but also of a\ndifferent, more radical kind, strengthening the force of the skeptical\nModes. That is a vast and rich literature not yet explored by scholars\non the history of skepticism. \nAs expected, Cartesian skepticism is one of the main objects of study.\nIn almost every country we find scholars trying to understand its\nsources, the nature of its arguments, their force and persuasiveness.\nOne decisive contribution, already noted above, is that of Porchat,\nwho credited Descartes’s methodological use of skepticism a\nspecial place in the philosophy. In Porchat’s view of the 1980s\n(Porchat 1985, 1986), there was a strong affinity between ancient\nskepticism and Cartesian doubt, so that one could speak properly of a\nskeptic-Cartesian model. The problem of the external world became,\nthereby, a crucial issue for those concerned with skepticism, because\nit was thought of as a skeptical problem. Following his lead, many\nother philosophers in Brazil, like Paulo Francisco Estrella Faria\n(2007), Luiz Eva (2001b, 2013b), Alexandre Noronha Machado (2007a),\nFlávio Williges (2007), among others, wrote papers on the\ntopic. \nIn Mexico, concern with Cartesian skepticism was once the dominant\nfocus of research on skepticism. One reason for this predominance is\nthe connection between the group of Laura Benítez (Mexico) and\nJosé Antonio Robles (Mexico) with Ezequiel de Olaso and Richard\nPopkin. This group was strongly oriented toward the work of Descartes\nand modern science. Consequently, Cartesian skepticism or\nmethodological skepticism was an important subject to them. Many\nmembers of the group shared, perhaps implicitly, the belief that the\nCartesian anti-skeptical strategy was successful to avoid disastrous\nskeptical consequences. Benítez (1987), for instance, has\ndevoted many of her works to Cartesian studies, and explored the\npositive methodological aspects of Cartesian skepticism to reach plain\ncertainty, as well as the relevance of skepticism for discussions\nconcerning the nature of human knowledge. \nSomething similar can be said about the situation in Colombia, where\nJean Paul Margot (2003) and Adolfo León Gómez (2002)\ngave a lot of attention to Cartesian skepticism. Also very important\nare the contributions of Mauricio Zuluaga, who has examined\ncontemporary interpretations of Cartesian skepticism, especially those\nbased on the closure principle (Zuluaga 2012), the Agrippan Trilemma\n(Zuluaga 2005) and the relations between Pyrrhonism and Cartesian\nskepticism (Zuluaga 2014). Zuluaga published an important book that\nemerged from his Ph.D. dissertation (Zuluaga 2007) and, with Margot,\nedited a collection (Margot and Zuluaga 2012), in which one finds many\npapers on modern skepticism, including on Montaigne, featuring\nscholars from Colombia and elsewhere. \nIn Peru we also find some interest in the relation between Descartes\nand skepticism. Jorge Secada (2000) has done work on Descartes and\nSuarez, but focused on Descartes with regard to skepticism. Humberto\nQuispe (1996) has also done research on this topic, mainly under the\ninfluence of Jorge Secada. \nFrench skepticism of the 17th century was given some\nattention, although not as much as one would like. Besides the already\nnoted contribution by José Raimundo Maia Neto (Brazil), the\nworks of Flávio Fontenelle Loque (Brazil) (2012) and Fernando\nBahr (Argentina) deserve to be highlighted. Loque’s book is on\nthe relation between skepticism and religion, more specifically on the\nvery notion of a Christian skepticism. He devoted attention not only\nto Montaigne and Pierre Charron, but also to François de la\nMothe Le Vayer. Bahr (1999, 2000a,b, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2010) focused\nmainly on Pierre Bayle, whose skeptical arguments touch on three main\npoints: the problem of evil, the foundations of religious belief and\ncivil tolerance. These topics led Bahr to study both the\n18th century, where he examines the influence of Bayle on\nHume (that was the topic of his Ph.D.), and to the first half of the\n17th century, where he focused his attention on the\nrelation between La Mothe Le Vayer and Descartes. Plinio Junqueira\nSmith (2013) shows the importance of the skeptical method both in\nBayle's historical work and in his philosophical thinking.\nSébastien Charles (Québec, Canada) (forthcoming a,b) has\nalso been working recently on some French skeptics, namely Simon\nFoucher and Pierre-Daniel Huet. His historical research follows the\ncurrent trend of erudition, discovering and exploring less known\nfigures, but who were very important at their time. \nBerkeley’s reaction to skepticism or his alleged skepticism did\nnot go unnoticed, despite not having received enough attention. One\nexception is José Antonio Robles (Mexico). Robles (1996) shows\nthat the Berkeleyan skeptical thesis that rejects the existence of a\nmaterial substance has important consequences, such as the rejection\nof many other subsidiary problems: matter’s indivisibility and\nthe idea of an extended God. Jaimir Conte (Brazil) (2008) also\nexplored the connections between Berkeley and skepticism in an\nimportant paper. Sébastien Charles (Québec, Canada)\n(2003) wrote a book on the early reception of Berkeley’s\nimmaterialism in France. At that time, Berkeley was considered the\ngreatest skeptic, until Kant pronounced Hume to be even greater.\nCharles shows, with plenty of erudition, how this image of Berkeley\nwas created in France. \nNot much attention was given to skepticism in the 18th\ncentury French materialist philosophy. However, Paulo Jonas de Lima\nPiva (Brazil) (2007, 2008a,b) has done some work focusing especially\non Diderot. Sébastien Charles (Québec, Canada) (2007)\ncalled attention to some clandestine skeptical manuscripts as well as\nto many less known skeptics of the period, not only in France, but\nalso in Germany. Charles (2012) and Rodrigo Brandão (2008)\nexplored the relations between Voltaire and skepticism. \nAn important contribution to understand Hume’s skepticism was\nprovided by Plínio Junqueira Smith, who published a book\n(1995a) on that topic and many papers (2011a,b). His main idea is that\nthe debate between Hume’s skepticism and Hume’s naturalism\npresupposes a false dichotomy. What commentators call Hume’s\nnaturalism is what Hume himself called his skepticism. Moreover,\ncommentators tend to think of skepticism as a mere negative doctrine,\nnot paying enough attention to its positive side. He also devoted much\neffort to show how Hume’s mitigated skepticism was connected to\nancient skepticism, in both its forms, and to modern skepticism. One\nshould also note the works of Livia Guimarães (Brazil) (1996,\n2008) who has devoted her career to the study of Hume’s thought,\nnot only his skepticism, but also many other aspects of the philosophy\nof the greatest modern skeptic. Humean scholarship has increased so\nmuch in Brazil that it is not possible to give a fair survey of its\nstatus in a limited space. \nInterest in Hume’s skepticism is not confined to Brazil.\nLisandro Aguirre (Argentina) (2007, 2008, 2010a,b), for instance, has\npublished many papers on Hume. His main point is that Hume follows\nPyrrhonism precisely when he thinks he is avoiding it, i.e., when Hume\nis saved by nature, he thinks he is not a Pyrrhonian, but in fact that\nwould be the hallmark of a Pyrrhonist. Humean skeptical arguments are\nalso studied in Colombia, for instance by Catalina Gonzalez (2010,\n2011). Humean skepticism was perhaps what generated Peruvian interest\nin modern skepticism. Although Juan Bautista Ferro Porcile (Peru) was\nmainly concerned with logic, he lectured extensively on modern\nphilosophy, especially in the empiricist tradition and in the Humean\nbranch of skepticism, on which he published an influential paper. \nThe relations between Kant and skepticism attracted much attention in\nLatin America, most of all in Mexico. We have already seen that a\ngroup of philosophers, most notably Pedro Stepanenko (2002a, 2006,\n2007), Efraín Lazos (2014), Isabel Cabrera (1999), and Jorge\nOrnelas (2005), combined historical scholarship with systematic\nworries, producing a number of publications on transcendental\narguments and skepticism, discussing the works of Wittgenstein, P.F.\nStrawson and Barry Stroud, among others, from a Kantian point of view.\nStepanenko, in particular, was more historically orientated. Roberto\nHorácio de Sá Pereira (2003) and Marco Franciotti (1994,\n1995), in Brazil, follows a similar path. In Colombia, Alejandro Rosas\n(Colombia) (1990) opened up this field of research with an influential\npaper. Following this path, Catalina González (Colombia) (2010)\ndeveloped a historical study of the relations between Kant and his\nancient skeptical sources. \nMore recently, still in Mexico, Ornelas (2014a, 2015) developed an\ninterpretation of Kantian anti-skepticism, according to which the\n“Refutation of Idealism” is not relevant, as is commonly\nassumed, but the “Fourth Paralogism” is. Plínio\nJunqueira Smith (2008a) holds a similar view, while at the\nsame time offering a wider interpretation. According to Smith, Kant\nresponded to three different kinds of modern skepticism: Cartesian\nskepticism concerning the external world (which Kant came to\nrecognize, in the second edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason, as an idealist problem, not a skeptical one); Baylean\nskepticism and the antinomies, and Humean skepticism on the objective\nvalidity of the categories. \nLuis Eduardo Hoyos (Colombia) (2001) has already published his\nimportant book El escepticismo y la filosofía\ntrascendental in which he assesses the argumentative potential of\nthe transcendental argument against Humean skepticism as received in\nthe philosophical German scene of the 18th century. Hoyos\nworks motivated a number of Colombian philosophers to devote their\nattention to the subject and the period. Ignacio Ávila\n(Colombia) (1996) explored this same vein, while Carlos Patarroyo\n(Colombia) sides with the Kantian position against Humean skepticism.\nCatalina González (Colombia) (2011) worked out the distinction\nbetween Academic skepticism and Pyrrhonism in Kant. \nAs many scholars have perceived the fundamental importance of Kant to\nmodern skepticism (and vice versa), it should not come as a\nsurprise that many others also perceived what is now called\npost-Kantian skepticism. Perhaps the first important study on the\ntopic is that of Luis Eduardo Hoyos (Colombia) (1995), when he\npublishes his Ph.D. dissertation, followed by two papers (Hoyos 1998,\n1999), to which Raúl Meléndez (Colombia) (2000) replied.\nInterest in post-Kantian skepticism is spreading around. Eduardo\nBrandão (Brazil) (2013) devotes his attention to skepticism in\nphilosophers such as G.E. Schulze, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Fichte.\nRicardo Cattaneo (Argentina) (2009, 2010) focuses both on discussions\non skepticism in Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy (Jacobi, Schulze)\nand on the interpretation and assimilation of skepticism in Hegel and\nGerman Idealism. Luiz Fernando Barrère Martin (Brazil)\n(2007a,b, 2011) has written his Ph.D. dissertation and published some\npapers on Hegel and skepticism. \nSergio Sánchez (Argentina) is an important reference for\nstudies concerning skepticism in the 19th and\n20th century. Sánchez (2010) focused on the presence\nof skepticism in Nietzsche, especially the influence of Sextus and\nCicero. In his papers, one important topic is that of\nNietzsche’s analysis of belief and its relation to skepticism.\nIn connection with Nietzsche, Kathia Hanza (Peru) (2011) has explored\ndifferent sides of skepticism. The works of Rogério Lopes\n(Brazil) (2006, 2012) on Nietzsche and skepticism, very similar in\nspirit to those of Sánchez and Hanza, also deserve to be\nmentioned. \nAncient skepticism has also attracted a lot of attention, though, like\nin almost all places, it has received less attention than modern\nskepticism. Roberto Bolzani Filho (Brazil) published a book (Bolzani\n2013) and a number of papers on the topic (Bolzani 1990, 1998, 2000,\n2005a). His book on Academic skepticism and Pyrrhonism is very\ncarefully written, well informed, and presents a detailed account of\nthe relationship between these two forms of ancient skepticism. Vitor\nHirschbruch Schvartz (2012) defends a rustic interpretation of\nSextus Empiricus. Recent scholarship is improving, as is shown by the\nworks of Rodrigo Pinto de Brito (Brazil) (2014) on Sextus. \nMore recently, studies on ancient skepticism grew thanks to the works\nof Diego Machuca (Argentina) (2006a,b, 2009, 2013a). His Ph.D.\ndissertation was on Sextus’ ethics. Afterwards, he has published\nmany papers and reviews, as well as organized events. He has also\nedited a number of important collections on the history of skepticism\n(2011a,b, 2013b). It is fair to say that no one gave more impulse to\nimprove Latin American scholarship on ancient skepticism than he did.\nWith Duncan Pritchard, Machuca is the editor of the International\nJournal for the Study of Skepticism. Thus, both for his personal\npapers and books and for his involvement in organizing research,\nMachuca is a leading figure in ancient skepticism. \nColombia has also given its contribution to the field. In\nCuadernos de Filosofía y Letras, we find not only the\nfirst book of the Esbozos Pirrónicos of Sextus\nEmpiricus translated by the philologist and Hellenist Jorge\nPáramo (1989), but also many papers by scholars such as Popkin,\nGiorgio Tonelli, Porchat and Olaso, together with an examination of\nthe importance of philosophical skepticism by Carlos B.\nGutiérrez (Colombia) (1989). In Mexico, Ornelas (Mexico) (2013,\n2014b) read Sextus’ works carefully, and found theoretical\nresources that can help with the engagement with contemporary\nepistemological issues. \nStudies on the history of skepticism before the modern period are not\nrestricted to Pyrrhonism and Academic skepticism. It should not go\nunmentioned Maurício Pagotto Marsola’s paper (Brazil)\n(2007) on Plotinus and skepticism, for this is a very unexpected\naspect of Plotinus’ philosophy. In connection to the origins of\nMedieval Philosophy, and especially Augustine and Descartes, Luis\nBacigalupo (Peru) (1999) has also done some research. Rodrigo Pinto de\nBrito (Brazil) (2015) has been working on the impact of skepticism in\nChristian thought. \nOne should also pay attention to Mauricio Beuchot (Mexico) (1996,\n2003) who devoted two papers to skepticism in the Middle Age. His\npoint is that skepticism attracted some attention even before\nRenaissance. According to him, many medieval authors developed\nskeptical positions. Among them, Augustine’s Platonic\nChristianity appealed to Academic skepticism in its theory of\nillumination, in which Augustine emphasized the fallibility of human\nknowledge; Averroes’ theory of double truth, according to which\nthere are two kinds of truth (truths for science and truths for faith)\nsimilarly has a skeptical tone, and those who thought that God could\nperhaps fool us were considering skeptical argument (Ockham, Pedro\nLombardo, Tomás de Aquino and Buenaventura, among others).\nBeuchot also remembers that Nicolás d’Autrecourt, a\nFrench monk (1300–1350 approximately), active in the University\nof Paris, anticipated Humean skepticism concerning causality. \nPerhaps it should also be mentioned some other studies on the history\nof skepticism. On the one hand, there are some literary studies.\nMachado de Assis, one of the best Brazilian writers, has been seen as\na skeptic by many people. One reason is that Machado read and used\nextensively Montaigne’s skepticism. José Raimundo de Maia\nNeto (1994) published a book on the topic. The novelty of his book is\nthat it was the first discussion on Machado’s skepticism based\non the history of skepticism. Paulo Roberto Margutti Pinto (2007) and\nGustavo Bernardo Krause (2007a) discussed Maia Neto’s\ninterpretation, and Maia Neto replied to them. Krause is a Brazilian\nnovelist as well as a professor of literature who published many books\nand papers on skepticism and literature (Krause 2004), on Machado\n(Krause 2006) and other writers such as the well-known Brazilian poet\nCarlos Drummond de Andrade (Krause 2007b). On the other hand, Paulo\nRoberto Margutti Pinto has been studying the history of Brazilian\nphilosophy, in which he sees an important role for skepticism long\nbefore Porchat brought it to center stage. In Pinto 2010, he argues\nfor the influence of Francisco Sanches on Brazilian colonial thought.\nOne of the reasons for Porchat’s success is that it seems that\nBrazilian thought has always had, at least in some places, a tendency\ntowards skepticism. Machado de Assis would not be an exception.","contact.mail":"plinio.smith@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"},{"date.published":"2016-02-12","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-latin-america/","author1":"Plínio Junqueira Smith","author1.info":"http://www.as.miami.edu/personal/obueno/Site/Otavio_Bueno.html","entry":"skepticism-latin-america","body.text":"\n\n\nThis entry examines the development and impact of the study of\nphilosophical skepticism throughout Latin America. It also highlights\nsome significant trends and important contributions made to this\nvenerable tradition by a number of Latin American philosophers.\n\n\nSkepticism is a philosophical activity of investigation characterized\nby the notion of suspension of judgment. Whereas dogmatists affirm or\ndeny a proposition on a given philosophical topic, skeptics neither\naffirm nor deny any proposition, i. e., they remain uncommitted to any\ndogmatic doctrine. According to skeptics, the basic opposition in\nphilosophy is that between those who endorse a philosophical theory\nand those who, after having inquired into the truth, did not find an\nanswer to the questions under examination. That is why skepticism came\nto be seen by dogmatic philosophers as a major challenge to their\nphilosophical project of finding the truth. Epistemologists and\nmetaphysicians alike set themselves the task of overcoming skepticism\nin order to establish their own doctrines. Thus, one constantly finds\ndogmatic philosophers trying to refute the skeptic. One criterion to\naccept a philosophical proposal is to determine to what extent it\novercomes the skeptical challenge.\n\n\nIn ancient times, skepticism had two main different forms: Pyrrhonism\nand Academic skepticism. Rediscovered in the Renaissance, skepticism\nbecame one of the pillars of modern philosophy, not only after modern\nskeptics, such as Michel de Montaigne, Pierre Bayle and David Hume,\ngave new impulse to it, but also because of the many answers to it\ndeveloped by philosophers such as Francis Bacon, René\nDescartes, George Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. In the analytic\ntradition, from G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell onwards, skepticism\nis a central topic of concern. This surprisingly long history shows\nnot only how deep is the skeptical challenge, but also how fascinating\nthe skeptical stance turns out to be.\n\n\nSimilarly to philosophers in many other parts of the world, Latin\nAmerican philosophers have faced skeptical challenges and have devoted\nclose attention to skepticism. They adopt, by and large, the same\nunderstanding of skepticism, share the same historical tradition, from\nPyrrho to contemporary analytic philosophy, that philosophers\nelsewhere have engaged with, and carry out the same kind of research\nas scholars all over the world do. What is specific about Latin\nAmerican scholars on skepticism is the fact that they are, in general,\nmore sympathetic toward skepticism than philosophers elsewhere tend to\nbe. Consequently, one finds not only studies on the history of\nskepticism and philosophical criticisms, but also developments of new\nforms of skepticism, which are worth considering with some care.\n\n\nIt may not be a mere coincidence that in 1991 Oswaldo Porchat, a\nleading Brazilian philosopher, and in 1994 Robert J. Fogelin coined\nthe word “neo-Pyrrhonism” to describe their respective\nphilosophical positions. That coincidence reflects both the increasing\nsignificance of the scholarship on skepticism, in Latin American and\nin Anglo-American philosophy, and a more sympathetic attitude toward\nthis venerable tradition. \nTo write about skepticism in Latin America is more difficult than one\nmay expect. First, the phenomena to be described are complex and\nmultifarious. Interest in skepticism is widespread in this part of the\nworld, and by no means confined to one country or to a small group of\nphilosophers. On the one hand, the significance of skepticism in the\nphilosophy of each country seems to vary wildly; on the other, the\nhistory of studies on skepticism in each country has its own internal\ndevelopment, despite many connections among the various countries\ninvolved. Second, interest in skepticism is so recent in Latin America\nthat not enough time has elapsed to provide some perspective on the\nissue. It is perhaps still too soon to give an entirely balanced view\nof skepticism in the region. But we will attempt our best to achieve\nthat. \nAn interesting feature of the Latin American way of approaching\nskepticism is by not taking it just as the embodiment of an opponent\nto be refuted. At the very least, there is not a widespread prejudice\nagainst skepticism. On the contrary, many Latin American philosophers\nhave strong sympathy for the skeptical proposal, and even those who\nare not skeptics themselves do not think that if the assumption of a\nphilosophical thesis leads to skepticism, this constitutes a kind of\nreductio ad absurdum of the initial assumption. Skepticism\nis, for many Latin American philosophers, at least a prima\nfacie tenable position. That does not mean, of course, that the\nmajority of those Latin American philosophers who deal with skepticism\nare skeptics, but we do find many that consider themselves as such.\nEven for those who are not skeptics, the significance of philosophical\nskepticism is undeniable, and Latin American philosophers have made\nefforts to understand carefully its meaning and historical role. \nThe best way to introduce skepticism in Latin America is not to\nexplain what goes on in each country, but to report what Latin\nAmerican philosophers have said concerning those topics that caught\ntheir attention. However, we will begin by presenting a brief\nhistorical background and the thought of the two founding fathers of\nLatin American work on skepticism: Oswaldo Porchat (Brazil) and\nEzequiel de Olaso (Argentina). Special care must be taken with their\nwork, because together they set the stage for a proper understanding\nof what happens in all other Latin American countries. We will then\nexamine what Latin American philosophers have been doing both in\ncontemporary skepticism and in the history of this philosophical\ntradition. Ours is not an exhaustive account, and being selective, it\nis unable to accommodate every proposal in the field. We hope,\nhowever, to give a fair idea of what has happened and is currently\ntaking place, in order to situate the reader and prompt additional\nresearch in the area. \nContemporary studies of skepticism began in Latin America thanks to\nthe works of Oswaldo Porchat and Ezequiel de Olaso, a distinguished\nArgentinian historian of philosophy. Due to their works, skepticism\nhas attracted a significant, although somewhat scattered, amount of\nattention in Latin America. Both were already interested in skepticism\nbefore they met for the first time. In 1968, Porchat gave a famous\nlecture, published in the following year, in which he called attention\nto a basic skeptical problem that every philosopher should try to\novercome: the problem of the conflict of philosophies (roughly, the\nfact that philosophical doctrines often disagree on their answers to\nany given philosophical question). Given his B.A. in classics and his\nPh.D. dissertation on Aristotle’s conception of science, it is\nnot surprising that Porchat came to know ancient skepticism very well.\nHis perspective was philosophical, and he identified his own\nphilosophical experience with that of the ancient skeptics. In the\nsame year of 1969, Olaso defended his Ph.D. dissertation on\n“Leibniz and the Ancient Skeptics” at Byrn Mawr College\n(Pennsylvania), in which he showed that Leibniz had a deep knowledge\nof Greek skepticism, whose modes he clearly identified in the\nCartesian arguments. Thus, one can say that skepticism in Latin\nAmerican began in the end of the 1960s. \nIn 1975, invited by Porchat, Olaso went to Brazil where he became a\nprofessor at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) until 1977.\nThis fact had a profound influence on the development of the studies\nof skepticism in both countries and even in other Latin American\ncountries. Their mutual collaboration proved very fruitful.\nPhilosophers interested on skepticism soon got in touch, for they\norganized seminal conferences on the topic (1986, in Campinas, Brazil;\nin 1992, in Buenos Aires, Argentina; unfortunately, no proceedings\nwere published). Throughout the years, many other conferences on\nskepticism were held (in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico) in which\nphilosophers from many countries took part and collective books on\nskepticism appeared. \nPorchat’s and Olaso’s influence was huge. They were the\nfounding fathers of skepticism in Latin America. One can speak of a\nsecond generation that was in touch from the 1990s onwards because\nthey paved the way first. Philosophers in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico,\nand Colombia have been collaborating in the last twenty years because\nthey both inaugurated a friendly, collaborative way of doing\nphilosophy that has been preserved by their followers. Though Olaso,\nPorchat and some of their disciples were in touch with many\nphilosophers from other countries and had a far-reaching influence,\nthere is no single, integrated explanation for that widespread\ninterest. \nThere is no doubt that skepticism flourished in Brazil like in no\nother Latin American country. It is perhaps not amiss to say that\nPorchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism is the most important achievement of\nLatin American skepticism, providing material for further systematic\ndiscussions. In Brazil, an important group of philosophers around\nPorchat was organized throughout the country in the 1980s, and they\nwere devoted not only to understand the history of skepticism but also\nto discuss contemporary skepticism, by developing it and criticizing\nit. The group held conferences every year, sometimes twice a year, and\nmany books, individual monographs and edited collections, were\npublished. Moreover, Porchat was professor and supervisor of a number\nof young philosophers as well as a reference to all other philosophers\nstudying skepticism. Even philosophers who were not primarily\ninterested in skepticism found the group’s way of doing\nphilosophy quite attractive. In fact, the group has always\nsystematically invited non-skeptical philosophers to enrich its\ndiscussions. As a result, as time went by, the group grew larger and\nlarger. \nArgentina, Mexico, and Colombia have also shown a lot of interest in\nskepticism with many important contributions to it, albeit perhaps not\nas systematically as in Brazil. In Argentina, work on skepticism\nremained at first somewhat confined to Olaso and to some historians of\nmodern philosophy around him. Later, there has been a growing interest\nin Argentina, this time from philosophers belonging to the analytic\ntradition, who were (and still are) also in touch with the Brazilian\ngroup, including, more recently, a new impulse to the study of ancient\nskepticism. \nIn Mexico, there is also a deep interest in skepticism. History of\nskepticism was not neglected, as we can be seen from the works of\nLaura Benítez and José Antonio Robles, among others,\nboth of whom worked with Olaso (and Popkin). Their focus is on modern\nskepticism. Some Mexican philosophers, working within a Kantian\ntradition, focused on transcendental arguments as weapons against\nskepticism. Others work on contemporary skepticism in connection to\nquestions such as disjunctivism and perception. Finally, skepticism\nand its connections to fallibilism and skeptical or epistemic\nconcepts, such as doubt and certainty, were a major\ntheme of some Mexican philosophers. \nThere has also been some interest in skepticism in many other\ncountries, most notably in Colombia. Usually, this interest is\ncombined with a classic author, such as Descartes, Hume, or Kant, or\nwith an analytic philosopher, like Wittgenstein or Dennett. More\nrecently, an interest in ancient skepticism has also arisen. In other\ncountries such as Peru, Chile and Uruguay, the interest in skeptical\nissues is more scattered. No more than a minor or incidental interest\nin either the history of skepticism or in current epistemological\nquestions that bear on the skeptical challenge is found. \nThe study and diffusion of skepticism in Argentina and in other\ncountries such as Brazil and Mexico owes a great deal to Ezequiel de\nOlaso. When Olaso died, Porchat noted that, despite not being a\nskeptic himself, Olaso “was indeed the father of Brazilian\nskepticism” (Porchat 1997). But his leadership and influence was\nvast, as Popkin testified: \nEzequiel de Olaso was one of the most prominent historians of\nphilosophy. He contributed enormously to arousing interest in a wide\nrange of topics in the history of philosophy through his writings, his\nteachings and his lectures in Latin America, North America and Europe.\n(Popkin 1997) \nOlaso taught in many universities both in Argentina and elsewhere. His\nPh.D. dissertation has not been published, but many papers resulted\nfrom it. Olaso wrote a number of important papers on skepticism, both\nancient and modern. He explored many authors in the 17th\nand 18th centuries: Hume, Benito Jerónimo\nFeijóo, Rousseau, Hobbes, and Leibniz. These developments were\nsummarized in Olaso 1994. Many of his papers are dedicated to\nHume’s skepticism. Olaso argued that Hume was an Academic\nskeptic, not a Pyrrhonist, as Popkin had supposed. More importantly,\nhis study of certain Enlightenment authors made Popkin revise his\ninterpretation that, apart from Hume, there was no interest at all in\nskepticism during the 18th century. \nOlaso’s work was not limited to the presence of skepticism in\nmodern philosophy. He also devoted his efforts to interpret certain\nconcepts of the main lexicon of skepticism. He was not only interested\nin skepticism from a historical point of view, but also from a\nphilosophical perspective: he argued vigorously against the coherence\nof the skeptical position in “Zétesis” (Olaso 1988)\na detailed paper on ancient Pyrrhonism, in which he displayed both an\naccurate understanding of this philosophical stance and a highly\ncritical attitude toward the Pyrrhonian conception of investigation.\nHis assessment of the concept of zétesis was very\ninfluential. Olaso interpreted it as an inquiry whose goal was\nsuspension of judgment, which defined Pyrrhonism, and contrasted it to\nthe open inquiry led by Academic and modern skeptics, whose goal is\ntruth. Among his contributions, one finds also the distinction between\nthe concept of doubt, or suspension of the mind, and the\nconcept of epokhé, or suspension of judgment, which\nwould be the proper attitude of a skeptic, because it is beyond doubt\nitself and tries to overcome it. These new interpretations were part\nof his debate with scholars like Naess, Chisholm, Mates, Frede and, of\ncourse, Porchat in order to find an acceptable form of contemporary\nskepticism. Based on Ortega y Gasset’s distinction between\nbelief and knowledge, he proposed new accounts of Moore’s\nnotions of common sense and certainty (Olaso 1975a) and the critical\nanalysis carried out by Wittgenstein (Olaso 1999). \nOlaso’s work on skepticism opened up two main directions that\nwere followed by many philosophers, whether under his direct influence\nor not. First, skepticism emerged as an epistemological problem and,\nin the light of the linguistic turn, he set the task of reinterpreting\nand making sense of this philosophical stance. Second, he initiated a\nscholarly investigation of the history of skepticism; particularly of\nmodern skepticism, but also both versions of its ancient form. \nIt is now time to present in some detail Porchat’s\nneo-Pyrrhonism, for it is arguably the most important contribution to\nLatin American skepticism. His seminal paper, “On What\nAppears”, was published in 1991, laying the foundations and the\noutline of his skeptical stance. Later, in a number of papers, he\nexplored the main ideas further, corrected minor points, developed new\naspects, and wrote some introductory and accessible texts. \nOne of the merits of Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism is that it\nprovides a general, articulated philosophical stance that one can\nadopt. Skepticism is not, as it is usually presented in\nepistemological circles, a mere doubt on this or that topic that\nshould be superseded, that is, it is not a methodological doubt or an\nexpedient to strengthen a dogmatic position. For most philosophers\nconcerned with skepticism, the coherence and intelligibility of the\nskeptical position is not really important. Any doubt, however crazy, may be useful, if it allows the philosopher to learn something about\nan argument. But Porchat does not think so. For him, skepticism is\nthought of as an articulated, plausible stance proposed by some\nphilosophers. Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism is not even confined to a\nbroad epistemological doctrine, since it is meant to be a general\nphilosophical attitude, which includes epistemological aspects, but is\nnot restricted to them. \nOne should also emphasize that his neo-Pyrrhonism has to be sharply\ndistinguished from Cartesian skepticism. Porchat makes it clear that\nneo-Pyrrhonian aporiai are a different sort of argument from\nCartesian doubts. In particular, neo-Pyrrhonism is not committed to\nmentalism (the doctrine that one can conceive the mind, and its\nrepresentations, as independent from the body) and does not it invite\nany sort of solipsism. Thus, most of the criticisms leveled against\nCartesian skepticism do not apply to neo-Pyrrhonism. \nNeo-Pyrrhonism has two parts: one negative, and the other positive.\nThe two most important concepts of the negative part are\ndiaphonía (the conflict among the various\nphilosophical doctrines) and epokhé (the suspension of\njudgment). For Porchat, ataraxía, or tranquility of\nmind, is not an essential ingredient of Pyrrhonism and it is more of\nhistorical interest. Given the conflict of philosophies, Porchat draws\nthe skeptical conclusion: being genuinely unable to choose between the\nvarious philosophical views, he suspends his judgment. He argues\nvigorously that the disagreement between philosophies is undecidable.\nNot even his previous “philosophy of the common view of the\nworld” (Porchat 1975, 1979) is able to solve or avoid the\nconflict. The conflict involves the dogmatism not only of philosophers\nof the common view of the world, but also of ordinary people. However,\nnot all philosophies are part of the conflict, since some philosophies\nare not dogmatic: they do not intend to describe the ultimate nature\nof things. \nPorchat (1993) distinguishes between two kinds of skeptical arguments:\ndialectical and empirical. This is a significant contribution of\nPorchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism to skepticism. Let us consider, first,\ndialectical arguments. The mode of diaphonía, in\nPorchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism, is the crucial one. But, of course,\nPorchat also considers the other modes of Agrippa as important\nskeptical weapons against dogmatism. More importantly, he recognizes\nthat for ancient Pyrrhonism the skeptical method of antinomies\n(arguing both pro and con with equal persuasiveness) is indispensable\nagainst the dogmatic claim that some doctrines and arguments are\nfelt stronger than others. That is, the method is\nindispensable to neutralize that dogmatic experience of unbalanced\narguments, by making stronger the weaker arguments. By arguing on both\nsides of an issue, the skeptic experiences them as being equally\nstrong. Why do they seem equally powerful in the skeptic’s\nintellectual experience? For the following reason: any criterion\nproposed to decide the issue will itself be part of the dispute, and\ndisagreement about it re-emerges. Skeptics do not commit themselves to\nthese dialectical arguments. They just use what dogmatists admit\nagainst dogmatism. Their whole point is to induce suspension of\njudgment in dogmatists while still maintaining their own\nepokhé. \nThere is, however, another route toward suspension of judgment.\nSkeptics can employ arguments they are able to endorse, which lead to\nthe conclusion that one ought to suspend judgment. As skeptics\n(Pyrrhonists) live their ordinary life like everyone else, they can\nalso reason like everyone else. They can search for the conjunction of\nphenomena in the world, establish empirical correlations, and infer\nthe presence of fire from the fact of smoke or the occurrence of a\nwound from the presence of a scar. Empirical reasoning leads us from\none phenomenon to another. Couldn’t it be the case that such\nempirical arguments lead to suspension of judgment? These arguments\nhave as premises what is apparent, and they do not indicate a\nconclusion beyond the phenomena, since epokhé, their\nconclusion, is an intellectual experience. According to Porchat\n(1993), Aenesidemus’ modes are empirical, not dialectical,\narguments in support of epokhé. \nWith regard to the positive part, neo-Pyrrhonism presents a detailed\naccount of the crucial notion of phainómenon. Porchat\nthought, in an earlier phase, that phainómenon was to\nbe identified with, or assimilated to, phantasía\n(Porchat 1985, 1986). That explains why he once construed that notion\nas implying some form of mentalism: what appears was conceived of as a\nmental representation. He later rejected that identification (Porchat\n1991). On his new explanation, phainómenon is best\naccounted for by another crucial notion: bíos, or\ncommon life. After all, says Sextus Empiricus, what appears is\nbíos. Thus, Sextus’ explanation of the skeptical\nstandard of action is also an explanation of the notion of\nphainómenon. By paying close attention to the fourfold\neveryday observances, one may understand better what the\nphainómenon is. At the same time, common life is to be\nunderstood as what is apparent (what appears to those who live it),\nnot as a reality in itself. \nAccording to Porchat, phenomena are a kind of residue from suspension\nof judgment; they are what is left after we have suspended judgment\nabout dogmatic discourse. And once dogmatism is left behind, life is\nwhat is left for us. The phenomena impose themselves to us, and it is\nnot up to us to accept them or not. One could say that phenomenon is\nwhat is “given” to us, but that is misleading, for in one\nsense it is not “given” at all. At first, Porchat asserted\nthat language is a kind of constitutive ingredient of the phenomena\nand language permeates all our experience (Porchat 1991); later,\nperhaps to avoid some Kantian or idealist connotation, he preferred to\ntalk of an association between what appears and language (Porchat\n1995, 2013). Thus, phenomena are impregnated by language, not given to\nus. \nOne important comment Porchat makes concerning phenomena is that they\nare always relative to someone. In fact, they may be personal or\npublic. Something may appear to someone or to more than one person,\nmaybe even to all of us. For instance, it may appear to you right now\nthat your are reading this article; and it may appear to many of us\nthat Brasilia is the capital of Brazil; and it may appear to all of us\nthat there are trees in the world. Here it can be noted that there is\nno solipsistic tendency in neo-Pyrrhonism, since many people in fact\nshare most phenomena. That solipsism is not an inherent tendency in\nneo-Pyrrhonism can already be seen due to the connections between the\nphenomena and common life. After all, what is apparent to us are\nobjects and events in the world, part of the life all of us live. \nAnother remark is that phenomena are sensible or intellectual. When\nsomething appears to the senses, such as the perception of a table in\nfront of you, it is a sensible phenomenon; when it appears to the\nintellect, such as a law, it is an intellectual phenomenon. For\nPorchat, there is no sharp line between these two kinds of phenomena.\nA sensible phenomenon also has some intellectual aspect: when you see\na table in front of you, the very idea of a table includes in it\nsomething that goes beyond what is present in your sensory modalities.\nHowever, although Porchat does not develop this idea explicitly, most\nintellectual phenomena seem to have a reference to something sensible,\nor at least to have something sensible in its origin. Therefore, many\nphenomena are typically of one kind, always including both a sensible\nand an intellectual aspect in them. Very recently, however, Porchat\ndropped that doctrine, and he now prefers to distinguish between two\nkinds of phenomena (Porchat 2013). \nPorchat’s interpretation of Pyrrhonism seems closer to\nFrede’s (1997) than to Burnyeat’s (1980). It seems that,\nfor him just like for Frede, skeptics have many beliefs in ordinary\nlife, but are not committed to philosophical beliefs (beliefs about\nthe truth of various philosophical views about the world). His\nneo-Pyrrhonism, therefore, would seem to be an urbane form of\nskepticism (cf. Barnes 1992). However, the very distinction at the\nbasis of that dispute between Frede and Burnyeat presupposes what\nPorchat rejects: a contrast between philosophers and ordinary people.\nFrom a neo-Pyrrhonist point of view, both are typically, though not\nalways, dogmatists: most philosophers are dogmatists and so are\nordinary folk; dogmatic philosophers only tend to be more refined in\nsome of their conceptions. \nThe crucial distinction is that between dogmatism and non-dogmatism.\nSometimes, ordinary people are not dogmatic, and neither are some\nphilosophers, such the skeptics (Pyrrhonists). For Porchat, many\ncontemporary philosophers are skeptics or have a skeptical tendency\nwithout knowing it (Porchat 2001). Thus, what matters for a\nneo-Pyrrhonist is not whether the skeptic has no beliefs whatsoever or\nonly ordinary beliefs, but whether he has dogmatic beliefs (concerning\nádela) or non-dogmatic beliefs (concerning what\nappears, that is, the world or bíos). Frede would have\nmissed the point concerning the scope of epokhé for\nnot having understood properly the notion of\nphainómenon (Porchat 1991). \nAccordingly, the basic neo-Pyrrhonian distinction is that between the\nphenomena and what is said about the phenomena. Dogmatic discourse is\nabout the phenomena. When dogmatists say “roses are\nred” they mean “roses are really red”, and\nthey have a theory to explain what that alleged reality consists in.\nThus, they are no longer talking about the world, but about a further\nreality posited by their theory. No one disputes whether a rose\nappears red, but whether it is in fact red. Not all discourse,\nhowever, is about the phenomena and some merely expresses the\nphenomena. Such is ordinary language in daily life, and such is also\nthe use of language by neo-Pyrrhonists: they use language to express\nwhat appears to them (or to us, if the phenomenon is a common one),\nbut not to state how things really are. In this sense, “roses\nare red” expresses how roses appear to us; and in this sense,\nneo-Pyrrhonists may even say it is true that roses are red\nand that we know it. Therefore, neo-Pyrrhonism is not, in one\nsense of the word, a form of relativism, since it accepts an objective\nknowledge about the world. \nTwo other Pyrrhonian concepts are updated by the neo-Pyrrhonist in the\npositive part: haíresis and zétesis.\nAccording to Porchat, neo-Pyrrhonists have a doctrine or “a\nskeptical view of the world”. This skeptical view of the world\nis an elaboration of how things appear to neo-Pyrrhonists. Skeptical\ndiscourse should be understood as an expression of phenomena. Thus,\nneo-Pyrrhonists may articulate explicitly their own view of the world.\nSince most phenomena are common, especially those that concern\nphilosophical issues, neo-Pyrrhonists will try to make explicit our\nways of thinking, at least as they see them. However, each skeptic\nwill have his or her own skeptical view of the world, since this view\ndepends also on the circumstances in which they live. \nLastly, it should be noted that neo-Pyrrhonists are empiricists, but\ntheir empiricism is improved by current philosophy of science. For\ninstance, they may endorse the hypothetic-deductive method. For them,\nwe can explore the world empirically, and in their skeptical view of\nthe world they may incorporate scientific results. For instance, we\nthink that the earth moves, and we no longer think that the earth is\nat the center of the universe. Scientific results may and do have\nimportant impacts on our view of the world, including on the\nneo-Pyrrhonists’. Porchat went as far as to distinguish between\na philosophical realism and a scientific realism (Porchat 1991, 1994),\nasserting that neo-Pyrrhonists need not be instrumentalists, but could\nhold scientific realism, although not, of course, philosophical\nrealism. If there is objective knowledge of the common world, it seems\nthat the sciences can improve on that knowledge being guided by an\nexperimental method such as the hypothetic-deductive. Neo-Pyrrhonian\nzétesis is not only a philosophical inquiry to destroy\ndogmatism, as in the case of Sextus, but also an empirical exploration\nof the world of phenomena. \nNeo-Pyrrhonism provoked a lot of different reactions in Brazil and\nelsewhere. Since it is impossible to review them all here, our purpose\nwill be to give a fair idea of them. \nThe first important reaction came from philosophers concerned with\nscientific knowledge. Hilan Bensusan and Paulo Souza (1994) thought\nthat Pyrrhonism was an outdated philosophy. In the face of\ncontemporary science, Pyrrhonism would no longer be a viable\nalternative, for it had not the adequate concepts to explain that\nscience. Therefore, the fact that science has evolved in unforeseeable\nways is an objection to neo-Pyrrhonism. Luiz Henrique de Araújo\nDutra (1993, 1995, 1996, 1997b), also criticizing Porchat’s\nconception of science, came to propose another skeptical position,\nwhich he called “alethic skepticism”. Dutra thought that\nthe metaphysical notion of truth is indispensable to scientific\nresearch. Both held that modern science establishes theories that\ncannot be doubted by the neo-Pyrrhonist. Otávio Bueno has a\nmore sympathetic proposal toward skepticism and develops a\nneo-Pyrrhonist approach to contemporary science by combining it with\nvan Fraassen’s view (Bueno 2015). Neo-Pyrrhonian empiricism\nemphasizes the notion of empirical adequacy. \nA second kind of response was given by those who want to develop or\nimprove on basic features of neo-Pyrrhonism. Some, such as\nPlínio Junqueira Smith (1995b), tried to purify neo-Pyrrhonism\nfrom what still looked like a dogmatic notion. For instance, the idea\nthat dogmatism is a disease and that the skeptic (Pyrrhonist) offers a\nbetter way of life by curing dogmatists of their disease may be mere\nprejudice. Therefore, the skeptical idea of therapy is perhaps\ndogmatic. The notion of common life as used by the neo-Pyrrhonist also\nseems to be an inheritance of Porchat’s “philosophy of the\ncommon view of the world” (Porchat 1975, 1979). The skeptical\nview of the world has an undeniable personal aspect. Waldomiro\nJosé da Silva Filho explored, on the one hand, skeptical\ndifficulties in common life neglected by the neo-Pyrrhonist (Silva\nFilho 2015) and, on the other, difficulties in self-knowledge, thereby\ntrying to extend neo-Pyrrhonism to subjects not touched upon by\nPorchat (Silva Filho 2007, 2008). \nAnother important discussion intended to correct and improve on\nneo-Pyrrhonism concerns the neo-Pyrrhonist view on truth. Porchat\ndeveloped in an important paper a skeptical doctrine of truth (Porchat\n1995). According to Porchat, once they have divorced from a\nmetaphysical notion of reality, neo-Pyrrhonists can defend a\ncorrespondence theory of truth: what we say and what appears would be\ncorrelated in our experience; it appears that there is a link between\nwhat we say and what appears to us. Eduardo Barrio (2000), however,\nthinks that the only alternative to a neo-Pyrrhonist is to adopt a\ndeflationist theory of truth, like the redundancy theory, and that any\ncorrespondence theory would imply dogmatism. \nAn unexpected and important development of neo-Pyrrhonism came from\nphilosophers who were also concerned with political philosophy. They\nwere interested in knowing what would be the skeptical (Pyrrhonian)\nproposal in politics. Porchat (in conversation) has always been very\nclear on this issue, for he holds that the skeptic could have any\npolitical doctrine, including a radical one: from extreme right to\nextreme left. After all, skepticism would not exclude any content of\nphainomena. But most think that not all alternatives are\naccessible to a skeptical position. Renato Lessa (1995) argues that\nthe neo-Pyrrhonist would be a liberal; Paulo Jonas de Lima Piva (2002)\nthinks he could be a social democrat or a socialist; Cicero\nRomão Araújo (2007, 2008) connects the notion of\nskepticism with the notion of citizenship. This debate opened up a new\nline of research concerning skepticism. \nVery recently, an internal criticism of neo-Pyrrhonism emerged and it\ndeserves to be mentioned. Vitor Hirschbruch Schvartz (2015) and Diego\nMachuca (2013a) argue for a rustic version of neo-Pyrrhonism,\naccording to which Pyrrhonists hold no beliefs, and do not stop short\nof all the consequences that one should derive from the force of the\nskeptical attack on dogmatism. A truly skeptical position would\ndestroy all beliefs, whether ordinary or philosophical. Accordingly,\nSchvartz and Machuca see themselves as rustic neo-Pyrrhonists, and do\nnot accept Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism with its non-dogmatic\nbeliefs. \nBut there have been many external criticisms whose intention is to\nreject neo-Pyrrhonism. Roberto Bolzani Filho developed an incisive\ncriticism of Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism. Bolzani (1996, 2003)\nidentified a sort of “naturalized reason” or some dogmatic\npresuppositions in the idea of a “healthy philosophy” in\nPorchat’s thinking. One could apply to skepticism the same kind\nof argument that the skeptic uses against other philosophies. In the\nend, skepticism would be part of the conflict among philosophies it\ntries to avoid. Bolzani also attempted to show that, despite\nPorchat’s intention, neo-Pyrrhonism is an outdated way of\nphilosophizing. Roberto Horácio de Sá Pereira (2003)\npresented a Kantian answer to Porchat’s neo-Pyrrhonism. He\nraised a number of difficulties to understand Porchat’s\nconception of phenomena, and argued that an acceptable solution would\ncome only from a transcendental philosophy. These two criticisms, if\nsound, should make one reconsider neo-Pyrrhonism. More recently,\nPereira (2015) came to defend naive realism against Pyrrhonism. \nJust as in many other parts of the world, contemporary skepticism in\nLatin America deals with epistemological issues within analytic theory\nof knowledge. Many anti-skeptical strategies, such as contextualism\nand externalism, deserved close scrutiny by Latin American\nphilosophers. Also the transcendental strategy has captured the\nattention of many philosophers interested in skepticism. But\ncontemporary skepticism is not confined to epistemology alone and it\nengages with, more broadly, analytic philosophy as a whole. Analytic\nworries about language and, more specifically, the notion of meaning\nhave led to the development of a new form of skepticism, known as\nmeaning skepticism. We will review some of the discussions on these\ntopics, beginning with the connections between skepticism and analytic\nphilosophy. \nDanilo Marcondes de Souza Filho (Brazil) developed some skeptical\nconcepts using Austin’s pragmatist view of language, and he also\nidentified many common ideas between Wittgenstein and Pyrrhonism\n(Marcondes de Souza Filho 1988, 1996a,b). Thus, Marcondes was\narticulating Pyrrhonism further in a similar spirit as Porchat.\nAnother groundbreaking work on skepticism derived from the linguistic\nturn is that of Samuel Cabanchik (Argentina). Cabanchik was interested\nin the possibility of a linguistic form of skepticism or skepticism\nabout meaning not only in Wittgenstein, but also in Aristotle and\nFrancisco Sanchez. His main focus, however, was Wittgenstein, about\nwhom he wrote two books (2003, 2010) and many papers (1990,\n2008a,b). \nMarcondes’ and Cabanchik’s concern with analytic\nphilosophy and its relation to skepticism was truly a guide to other\nphilosophers. The connections between skepticism and the philosophy of\nthe later Wittgenstein have been highlighted by many scholars.\nPlínio Junqueira Smith (1994) tried to show the strong\naffinities between Wittgenstein’s later philosophy and ancient\nPyrrhonism, to which Paulo Roberto Margutti (Brazil) (Pinto 1996a)\noffered a criticism. In the same spirit, Guadalupe Reinoso (Argentina)\n(2006, 2008, 2009) calls our attention to the value of skepticism in\nboth Sextus and Wittgenstein as an ars vivendi: their\ncriticism of language’s bewitchment, anti-theoretical\nperspective, and conception of philosophy as a therapy. Magdalena\nHolguín (Colombia) (1997) and R. Meléndez (Colombia)\n(2014) also analyze the relations between skepticism and Wittgenstein.\nPamela Lastres (Peru) (2011) has recently been doing some promising\nwork on Wittgenstein and Moore, but also on Pyrrhonian skepticism. It\nis also worth noting that Oscar Nudler (Argentina) (2010) has\ndeveloped what he calls a “philosophy of the limits”,\ninspired both by Wittgenstein and the Socratic awareness of our\nignorance, which, although not properly skeptic, is a doctrine at\nleast closely associated with skepticism. \nMore recently, Glenda Satne (Argentina) (2003, 2005a,b, 2008) also\npursued a line of research based on analytic theories of meaning and,\nmore specifically, on meaning skepticism. She has been busy with\nskeptical arguments derived from contemporary semantics, such as\nQuine’s argument from the indeterminacy of radical translation,\nPutnam’s model-theoretic argument, Dummett’s argument from\nthe manifestation of linguistic knowledge and, above all,\nKripke’s (or Kripkenstein’s) skeptical arguments. Meaning\nskepticism was also the subject of a very well informed book by Silvio\nMota Pinto (Brazil/Mexico) (2009, 2014), and Efraín Lazos\n(Mexico) (2002) published interesting papers on Wittgenstein, Kripke,\nand meaning skepticism as well. \nThus, the connection between skepticism and analytic philosophy became\na topic to be further explored by Latin American philosophers. Porchat\nhad argued that contemporary analytic philosophy was to a good extent\nskeptical without knowing it. According to him, many analytic\nphilosophers don’t understand very well what skeptics had said\nand what they call a skeptic does not correspond to skepticism,\nproperly understood. If they had the appropriate knowledge of the\nhistory of skepticism, they would perhaps acknowledge the skeptical\norientation of their doctrines. It is not clear, however, that that is\nthe case in analytic philosophy. One debate that has received some\nattention is how far this or that analytic philosopher is close to\nskepticism. For instance, against Porchat’s opinion about Quine,\nMarcos Nascimento Bulcão (Brazil) wrote a book on Quine’s\nnaturalistic realism, denying that he is a skeptic (Bulcão\n2008). However, the perception of a skeptical Quine still persists in\nsome places. \nDavidson is another analytic philosopher whose connections to\nskepticism have been assessed by Latin American philosophers. Eleonora\nOrlando (Argentina) (2000) wrote a paper criticizing Davidson, for his\nconception of language would end up, despite his intentions, into a\nkind of semantic skepticism. Cristian Barturén (Peru), on the\nother hand, is interested on Davidson’s critique of global\nSkepticism. Otávio Bueno (Brazil/USA) criticized the way in\nwhich Davidson tries to respond to skepticism (Bueno 2005). \nThe relation between P.F. Strawson and skepticism has also been\nassessed by a number of Latin American scholars on contemporary\nskepticism or on analytic philosophy. Perhaps the most important\ncontribution comes from a Mexican group. We will talk more about them\nbelow, when we discuss transcendental arguments as an anti-skeptical\nstrategy. Sergio Sanchez (Argentina) (2006), Marco Franciotti (2009)\nand Plínio Junqueira Smith (2015) have also done some work in\nthis topic. \nOther analytic philosophers engaged with the issue further. To give\nbut one example, Miguel Ángel Fernández (Mexico) (2014)\ncriticized the incoherence of the anti-skeptical epistemology of\nbelief attribution developed by Crispin Wright. According to\nFernández, Wright intends to combine two desiderata in\na single anti-skeptical strategy, to wit, a concessive\nelement to the skeptic, on the one hand, and a rescue\nelement, on the other. However, he argues, that combination is\nimpossible. \nPerhaps one should note that contemporary skepticism was also\ndeveloped along other philosophical traditions, not only of an\nanalytic orientation. Under the influence of Wittgenstein, but also of\nStanley Cavell, Mario Gensollem (Mexico) (2006) explored the role of\nskepticism not only in philosophy, but also in common life. He came to\nembrace the Cavellian thesis that philosophical skepticism is the best\nexpression of the intrinsic finitude of human nature. Sergio\nSánchez (Argentina) (2006) called attention not only to\nStrawson’s but also to Heidegger’s assessment of skeptical\narguments. Jônadas Techio (Brazil) (2013) also investigated,\nfrom a Cavellian and Heideggerian points of view, the importance of\nphilosophical skepticism. \nSkeptical worries are usually linked to epistemological issues. We\nfind in Mexico a group of philosophers who have a very strong\nconnection to skepticism. They go as far as proposing new forms of\nskepticism. Armando Cíntora (Mexico) (2010), for instance,\nholds a Pyrrhonian position in philosophy of science. According to\nCíntora, a methodological Pyrrhonism would be of great help to\nliberate scientists from the dogmas that keep them captive when they\ntry to develop their scientific research. Just like in Sextus’\ncase, Cíntora argues that this kind of methodological\nPyrrhonism is not an epistemic paralysis: Pyrrhonian scientists can\npractice science, since they are aware of the non-dogmatic (temporal)\ncharacter of their ontological, methodological and semantic\nprinciples. Such acknowledgment will keep them safe from a dogmatic\noutlook. \nJorge Ornelas (Mexico) (2012, 2014a; Cíntora and Ornelas\n2013a), a younger member of that group, focused on the main\nanti-skeptical strategies in contemporary philosophy (contextualism,\nbelief-attribution epistemology, dogmatism, transcendental approach,\nexternalism, etc.). Ornelas tried to show that none of these\nstrategies succeed or dislodge the traditional skeptical challenge,\nchiefly because they lack a satisfactory diagnosis of the motivations\nbehind the skeptical problematic. Therefore, they fall prey to a\ndouble error: not only do they fail to eradicate the basic motivations\nbehind skepticism, but also they pay no attention to the fact that the\ntraditional skeptical problematic emerges only for theories and\nconcepts of knowledge that do not threaten ordinary knowledge\nattributions. \nFallibilism and skepticism were the topics of some papers written by\nGuillermo Hurtado (Mexico). Hurtado (2002a) holds that, although these\ntwo positions are closely related, one must keep them apart; he\nrejects fallibilism because it is revisionist. Not much later, he\nargues in favor of using more fine-grained epistemic terms. According\nto Hurtado (2005), one should distinguish various senses of\n“doubt”, introduce the notion of “suspicion”,\nand accept various degrees of certainty. His basic idea is to enrich\nthe vocabulary of epistemology, including more sophisticated skeptical\nterms. \nMany, of course, reject the skeptical position. Paulo Francisco\nEstrella Faria (Brazil) (2007, 2012), for instance, argued against\nskepticism. In fact, he thinks, skepticism is committed to a kind of\nidealism, even in the case of Porchat and despite his explicit\nrejection of this philosophical view. According to Faria, any\nassertion implies a claim to absolute truth and, if skeptics assert\nanything, as they do in ordinary life, then they are committed to what\nthey would rather avoid. The skeptic view of language is, therefore,\nuntenable, and there is a type of pragmatic contradiction in the\nskeptic’s position. That criticism has been endorsed by Roberto\nHorácio de Sá Pereira (Brazil) (2003, 2015). \nThe works of Eleonora Cresto (Argentina) and Alejandro Miroli\n(Argentina) also distance themselves from the skeptical position.\nCresto (1996, 1997) focused on anti-skeptical strategies that arise\nfrom naturalistic positions, whether along Wittgensteinian lines or\nfollowing F. Dretske and other reliabilists. Miroli (2007, 2008,\n2010), in turn, dealt with scientific skepticism, addressing both\ngeneral cases and socially important ones. He also examined\nDretske’s relevant alternatives argument, and tried to determine\nwhich kinds of alternatives one should exclude and which one can\nneglect in knowledge attributions. \nSeveral additional epistemological strategies were put under close\nscrutiny by Latin American epistemologists. Here are a few of them.\nDiana Hoyos (Colombia) (2006) works on contemporary theory of\nknowledge, linking the concepts of epistemic responsibility, Gettier\nexamples and skepticism. Jorge Gregorio Posada (Colombia) (2007) has\nresponded to her work. Ignacio Ávila (Colombia) (2003)\nconfronts Davidson’s thesis that most of our beliefs are true\nwith the corresponding skeptical challenge. Another popular\nanti-skeptical strategy is contextualism. Flávio Williges\n(Brazil) devoted his Ph.D. dissertation to that subject, from which\nresulted a paper (Williges 2013), and André Joffily Abath\n(Brazil) (2012) uses contextualism to refute Cartesian skepticism. \nAmong the anti-skeptical strategies, the one that invokes\ntranscendental considerations deserves special mention. A group of\nphilosophers in Mexico is the most distinguished one concerning this\nKantian-Strawsonian-inspired answer to skepticism. Pedro Stepanenko\n(Mexico) explored the anti-skeptical potential of the Kantian concept\nof the synthetic unity of apperception in many papers (2001, 2002a,\n2006, 2007, 2008). According to his interpretation, this unity should\nbe considered as the unity of our mental states that is possible only\nthrough the inferential relations to their contents. This unity makes\npossible the self-consciousness that any argumentative practice\nrequires. If we could suspend judgment with respect to any subject, we\nwould renounce to establish inferential relations among the contents\nof our mental states; in that case, there would be no consciousness\nunity, nor knowledge of our mental states. \nIn that same Kantian group, the works of Efraín Lazos\n(México) are outstanding. Lazos (2002, 2014) was able to\ncombine Kantian and Wittgensteinian anti-skepticism to produce new\nperspectives on the skeptical challenge. More recently, Lazos appealed\nto a transcendental strategy based on the works of Barry Stroud to\nshow the anti-skeptical force of transcendental arguments. Isabel\nCabrera (Mexico) (1999) edited a book on transcendental arguments, in\nwhich the force and limits of such arguments as tools against\nskepticism are assessed. Cabrera (2002) also worked out the relations\nbetween Buddhism and skepticism. In particular, she showed that both\nin Buddhism and in Humean skepticism there is an attack on the notion\nof substance, and that the lack of commitment to substances in\none’s understanding of the world has a therapeutic function,\nnamely, to avoid suffering. \nThe so-called Agrippan trilemma is an important argument for\ncontemporary skepticism. Some Latin American philosophers have tried\nto answer this deep, difficult skeptical challenge. José de\nTeresa (Mexico) (2000, 2013, 2014) developed an anti-skeptical\nstrategy inspired in Plato’s dialectic. According to de Teresa,\nPlato’s strategy is effective against the trilemma presented by\nthe skeptic, because it escapes the three alternatives under\nconsideration. \nAmong the Agrippan modes, however, the most important for Latin\nAmerican skepticism seems to be diaphonía or\ndisagreement. We saw how important it is to Porchat’s\nneo-Pyrrhonism (1969, 1991, 1993). Some efforts have recently been\nmade to compare the skeptical, Agrippan mode of\ndiaphonía to contemporary reflections on disagreement.\nOf particular importance is Diego Machuca’s (Argentina) (2013a)\nidea that diaphonía is different from disagreement.\nMachuca accuses contemporary epistemologists who defend that\ndisagreement leads to suspension of judgment of dogmatism. According\nto Machuca, they base their arguments on dogmatist principles to reach\nsuspension of judgment. It also deserves to be noted Otávio\nBueno’s (Brazil) defense of diaphonía from\nrecent attacks, such as Barnes’ criticism (Bueno 2013). Bueno\noffers an interpretation of diaphonía free from the\nproblems that arise from faulty interpretations. Perhaps this is\nanother topic in which one may discover some original contributions\nfrom Latin American skepticism. There has also been some efforts to\nextend the mode of disagreement in contemporary skepticism into\nlogical matters (Barrio 2015), as well as some discussion concerning\nevaluative judgments and the notion of relative truth (Orlando\n2014). \nThe history of skepticism has also attracted the attention of many\nscholars throughout Latin America. As in most places, historical\ninvestigation tended to concentrate in the modern period, mostly on\nCartesian and Humean skepticism, though many other authors, such as\nMontaigne, Bacon, Bayle, and Kant, were also on the spot. Although\nBrazilian scholarship has perhaps made more contributions, one should\nnot neglect the huge and widespread interest in modern skepticism\nthroughout Latin America. \nThe most important work on the history of skepticism is arguably that\nof José Raimundo Maia Neto (Brazil), who worked with Popkin.\nMaia Neto got interested in skepticism through his contact with Danilo\nMarcondes and, some time later, with Porchat’s works. His main\ncontribution is that Academic skepticism played a more important role\nin modern skepticism than Popkin’s interpretation recognizes\n(Maia Neto 1997a, 2005, 2013a). According to Maia Neto, Popkin\nemphasized the importance of Pyrrhonism for modern philosophy, but\nneglected the fact that Academic skepticism was also widely known and\nused by many philosophers. In order to defend this interpretation,\nMaia Neto wrote a number of papers on philosophers like Montaigne\n(Maia Neto 2004, 2012), Pierre Charron (Maia Neto 2014), Descartes\n(Maia Neto 2001), Gassendi (Maia Neto 1997b) and Pierre-Daniel Huet\n(Maia Neto 2008a,b). In fact, he explored the whole modern skepticism\nfrom Montaigne onwards, with important texts on Pascal (Maia Neto\n1995), Bayle (Maia Neto 1996), and Hume (Maia Neto 1991). \nAnother important contribution is that of Luiz Antonio Alves Eva\n(Brazil), who has studied in great detail Montaigne’s\nEssays, publishing two books (2004, 2007b) and a number of\npapers in Brazil and elsewhere (2001a, 2012, 2013a). Still in Brazil,\nRenato Lessa (Brazil) (1995, 2003) has done some work on\nMontaigne’s political skepticism, showing that skeptics, by\nacknowledging the role of habit, would be realists in politics. Smith\n(2012a), criticizing Eva’s interpretation, who insists on the\naffinities between Montaigne and ancient skeptics, tries to uncover\nmore differences. In Argentina, there has also been some work on\nMontaigne’s skepticism. In addition to Fernando Bahr\n(Argentina), to whom we shall return, Soledad Croce (Argentina) (2006,\n2007), for instance, has published many papers on what she takes as\nthe practical skepticism of Montaigne. \nLuiz Eva (Brazil) (2006, 2008, 2011) also focused on the relations\nbetween Francis Bacon and skepticism. He proposed some careful\ninterpretations of the Theory of the Idols and skeptical arguments\nstemming from ancient Pyrrhonism and from Montaigne and Sanchez. He\nshowed not only the skeptical origins of most Baconian idols, but also\nhow their structure changed the skeptical Modes, thereby revealing\nwhat is properly new in Bacon. Silvia Manzo (Argentina) (2009) wrote\non the same subject, holding a balanced view, in which there is a\ndouble attitude in light of the skeptical threat. More recently, she\nreturned to that topic (Manzo forthcoming), providing a reconstruction\nof Francis Bacon’s reception of Academic skepticism. She deals\nwith the assessment of ancient skepticism throughout Bacon’s\nwritings and argues that he, on the one hand, approved of the state of\ndoubt and the suspension of judgment and, on the other hand, rejected\nthe notion of acatalepsia. Plínio Junqueira Smith (Brazil)\n(2012b), referring to both scholars, showed that Bacon’s main\nfocus is on the propositions “nothing is known” and\n“nothing can be known”, to which he devoted careful\nattention. According to him, Bacon used skeptical weapons to reject\nthe whole traditional philosophy (including skepticism), not only to\ncriticize dogmatism, thereby distancing himself from it. \nDanilo Marcondes (Brazil) (2009, 2012) has been doing original,\nimportant research on the ancient Modes and the discovery of the New\nWorld. This discovery offered not only many more examples of the same\nkind of diversity Europeans were familiar with, but also of a\ndifferent, more radical kind, strengthening the force of the skeptical\nModes. That is a vast and rich literature not yet explored by scholars\non the history of skepticism. \nAs expected, Cartesian skepticism is one of the main objects of study.\nIn almost every country we find scholars trying to understand its\nsources, the nature of its arguments, their force and persuasiveness.\nOne decisive contribution, already noted above, is that of Porchat,\nwho credited Descartes’s methodological use of skepticism a\nspecial place in the philosophy. In Porchat’s view of the 1980s\n(Porchat 1985, 1986), there was a strong affinity between ancient\nskepticism and Cartesian doubt, so that one could speak properly of a\nskeptic-Cartesian model. The problem of the external world became,\nthereby, a crucial issue for those concerned with skepticism, because\nit was thought of as a skeptical problem. Following his lead, many\nother philosophers in Brazil, like Paulo Francisco Estrella Faria\n(2007), Luiz Eva (2001b, 2013b), Alexandre Noronha Machado (2007a),\nFlávio Williges (2007), among others, wrote papers on the\ntopic. \nIn Mexico, concern with Cartesian skepticism was once the dominant\nfocus of research on skepticism. One reason for this predominance is\nthe connection between the group of Laura Benítez (Mexico) and\nJosé Antonio Robles (Mexico) with Ezequiel de Olaso and Richard\nPopkin. This group was strongly oriented toward the work of Descartes\nand modern science. Consequently, Cartesian skepticism or\nmethodological skepticism was an important subject to them. Many\nmembers of the group shared, perhaps implicitly, the belief that the\nCartesian anti-skeptical strategy was successful to avoid disastrous\nskeptical consequences. Benítez (1987), for instance, has\ndevoted many of her works to Cartesian studies, and explored the\npositive methodological aspects of Cartesian skepticism to reach plain\ncertainty, as well as the relevance of skepticism for discussions\nconcerning the nature of human knowledge. \nSomething similar can be said about the situation in Colombia, where\nJean Paul Margot (2003) and Adolfo León Gómez (2002)\ngave a lot of attention to Cartesian skepticism. Also very important\nare the contributions of Mauricio Zuluaga, who has examined\ncontemporary interpretations of Cartesian skepticism, especially those\nbased on the closure principle (Zuluaga 2012), the Agrippan Trilemma\n(Zuluaga 2005) and the relations between Pyrrhonism and Cartesian\nskepticism (Zuluaga 2014). Zuluaga published an important book that\nemerged from his Ph.D. dissertation (Zuluaga 2007) and, with Margot,\nedited a collection (Margot and Zuluaga 2012), in which one finds many\npapers on modern skepticism, including on Montaigne, featuring\nscholars from Colombia and elsewhere. \nIn Peru we also find some interest in the relation between Descartes\nand skepticism. Jorge Secada (2000) has done work on Descartes and\nSuarez, but focused on Descartes with regard to skepticism. Humberto\nQuispe (1996) has also done research on this topic, mainly under the\ninfluence of Jorge Secada. \nFrench skepticism of the 17th century was given some\nattention, although not as much as one would like. Besides the already\nnoted contribution by José Raimundo Maia Neto (Brazil), the\nworks of Flávio Fontenelle Loque (Brazil) (2012) and Fernando\nBahr (Argentina) deserve to be highlighted. Loque’s book is on\nthe relation between skepticism and religion, more specifically on the\nvery notion of a Christian skepticism. He devoted attention not only\nto Montaigne and Pierre Charron, but also to François de la\nMothe Le Vayer. Bahr (1999, 2000a,b, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2010) focused\nmainly on Pierre Bayle, whose skeptical arguments touch on three main\npoints: the problem of evil, the foundations of religious belief and\ncivil tolerance. These topics led Bahr to study both the\n18th century, where he examines the influence of Bayle on\nHume (that was the topic of his Ph.D.), and to the first half of the\n17th century, where he focused his attention on the\nrelation between La Mothe Le Vayer and Descartes. Plinio Junqueira\nSmith (2013) shows the importance of the skeptical method both in\nBayle's historical work and in his philosophical thinking.\nSébastien Charles (Québec, Canada) (forthcoming a,b) has\nalso been working recently on some French skeptics, namely Simon\nFoucher and Pierre-Daniel Huet. His historical research follows the\ncurrent trend of erudition, discovering and exploring less known\nfigures, but who were very important at their time. \nBerkeley’s reaction to skepticism or his alleged skepticism did\nnot go unnoticed, despite not having received enough attention. One\nexception is José Antonio Robles (Mexico). Robles (1996) shows\nthat the Berkeleyan skeptical thesis that rejects the existence of a\nmaterial substance has important consequences, such as the rejection\nof many other subsidiary problems: matter’s indivisibility and\nthe idea of an extended God. Jaimir Conte (Brazil) (2008) also\nexplored the connections between Berkeley and skepticism in an\nimportant paper. Sébastien Charles (Québec, Canada)\n(2003) wrote a book on the early reception of Berkeley’s\nimmaterialism in France. At that time, Berkeley was considered the\ngreatest skeptic, until Kant pronounced Hume to be even greater.\nCharles shows, with plenty of erudition, how this image of Berkeley\nwas created in France. \nNot much attention was given to skepticism in the 18th\ncentury French materialist philosophy. However, Paulo Jonas de Lima\nPiva (Brazil) (2007, 2008a,b) has done some work focusing especially\non Diderot. Sébastien Charles (Québec, Canada) (2007)\ncalled attention to some clandestine skeptical manuscripts as well as\nto many less known skeptics of the period, not only in France, but\nalso in Germany. Charles (2012) and Rodrigo Brandão (2008)\nexplored the relations between Voltaire and skepticism. \nAn important contribution to understand Hume’s skepticism was\nprovided by Plínio Junqueira Smith, who published a book\n(1995a) on that topic and many papers (2011a,b). His main idea is that\nthe debate between Hume’s skepticism and Hume’s naturalism\npresupposes a false dichotomy. What commentators call Hume’s\nnaturalism is what Hume himself called his skepticism. Moreover,\ncommentators tend to think of skepticism as a mere negative doctrine,\nnot paying enough attention to its positive side. He also devoted much\neffort to show how Hume’s mitigated skepticism was connected to\nancient skepticism, in both its forms, and to modern skepticism. One\nshould also note the works of Livia Guimarães (Brazil) (1996,\n2008) who has devoted her career to the study of Hume’s thought,\nnot only his skepticism, but also many other aspects of the philosophy\nof the greatest modern skeptic. Humean scholarship has increased so\nmuch in Brazil that it is not possible to give a fair survey of its\nstatus in a limited space. \nInterest in Hume’s skepticism is not confined to Brazil.\nLisandro Aguirre (Argentina) (2007, 2008, 2010a,b), for instance, has\npublished many papers on Hume. His main point is that Hume follows\nPyrrhonism precisely when he thinks he is avoiding it, i.e., when Hume\nis saved by nature, he thinks he is not a Pyrrhonian, but in fact that\nwould be the hallmark of a Pyrrhonist. Humean skeptical arguments are\nalso studied in Colombia, for instance by Catalina Gonzalez (2010,\n2011). Humean skepticism was perhaps what generated Peruvian interest\nin modern skepticism. Although Juan Bautista Ferro Porcile (Peru) was\nmainly concerned with logic, he lectured extensively on modern\nphilosophy, especially in the empiricist tradition and in the Humean\nbranch of skepticism, on which he published an influential paper. \nThe relations between Kant and skepticism attracted much attention in\nLatin America, most of all in Mexico. We have already seen that a\ngroup of philosophers, most notably Pedro Stepanenko (2002a, 2006,\n2007), Efraín Lazos (2014), Isabel Cabrera (1999), and Jorge\nOrnelas (2005), combined historical scholarship with systematic\nworries, producing a number of publications on transcendental\narguments and skepticism, discussing the works of Wittgenstein, P.F.\nStrawson and Barry Stroud, among others, from a Kantian point of view.\nStepanenko, in particular, was more historically orientated. Roberto\nHorácio de Sá Pereira (2003) and Marco Franciotti (1994,\n1995), in Brazil, follows a similar path. In Colombia, Alejandro Rosas\n(Colombia) (1990) opened up this field of research with an influential\npaper. Following this path, Catalina González (Colombia) (2010)\ndeveloped a historical study of the relations between Kant and his\nancient skeptical sources. \nMore recently, still in Mexico, Ornelas (2014a, 2015) developed an\ninterpretation of Kantian anti-skepticism, according to which the\n“Refutation of Idealism” is not relevant, as is commonly\nassumed, but the “Fourth Paralogism” is. Plínio\nJunqueira Smith (2008a) holds a similar view, while at the\nsame time offering a wider interpretation. According to Smith, Kant\nresponded to three different kinds of modern skepticism: Cartesian\nskepticism concerning the external world (which Kant came to\nrecognize, in the second edition of the Critique of Pure\nReason, as an idealist problem, not a skeptical one); Baylean\nskepticism and the antinomies, and Humean skepticism on the objective\nvalidity of the categories. \nLuis Eduardo Hoyos (Colombia) (2001) has already published his\nimportant book El escepticismo y la filosofía\ntrascendental in which he assesses the argumentative potential of\nthe transcendental argument against Humean skepticism as received in\nthe philosophical German scene of the 18th century. Hoyos\nworks motivated a number of Colombian philosophers to devote their\nattention to the subject and the period. Ignacio Ávila\n(Colombia) (1996) explored this same vein, while Carlos Patarroyo\n(Colombia) sides with the Kantian position against Humean skepticism.\nCatalina González (Colombia) (2011) worked out the distinction\nbetween Academic skepticism and Pyrrhonism in Kant. \nAs many scholars have perceived the fundamental importance of Kant to\nmodern skepticism (and vice versa), it should not come as a\nsurprise that many others also perceived what is now called\npost-Kantian skepticism. Perhaps the first important study on the\ntopic is that of Luis Eduardo Hoyos (Colombia) (1995), when he\npublishes his Ph.D. dissertation, followed by two papers (Hoyos 1998,\n1999), to which Raúl Meléndez (Colombia) (2000) replied.\nInterest in post-Kantian skepticism is spreading around. Eduardo\nBrandão (Brazil) (2013) devotes his attention to skepticism in\nphilosophers such as G.E. Schulze, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Fichte.\nRicardo Cattaneo (Argentina) (2009, 2010) focuses both on discussions\non skepticism in Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy (Jacobi, Schulze)\nand on the interpretation and assimilation of skepticism in Hegel and\nGerman Idealism. Luiz Fernando Barrère Martin (Brazil)\n(2007a,b, 2011) has written his Ph.D. dissertation and published some\npapers on Hegel and skepticism. \nSergio Sánchez (Argentina) is an important reference for\nstudies concerning skepticism in the 19th and\n20th century. Sánchez (2010) focused on the presence\nof skepticism in Nietzsche, especially the influence of Sextus and\nCicero. In his papers, one important topic is that of\nNietzsche’s analysis of belief and its relation to skepticism.\nIn connection with Nietzsche, Kathia Hanza (Peru) (2011) has explored\ndifferent sides of skepticism. The works of Rogério Lopes\n(Brazil) (2006, 2012) on Nietzsche and skepticism, very similar in\nspirit to those of Sánchez and Hanza, also deserve to be\nmentioned. \nAncient skepticism has also attracted a lot of attention, though, like\nin almost all places, it has received less attention than modern\nskepticism. Roberto Bolzani Filho (Brazil) published a book (Bolzani\n2013) and a number of papers on the topic (Bolzani 1990, 1998, 2000,\n2005a). His book on Academic skepticism and Pyrrhonism is very\ncarefully written, well informed, and presents a detailed account of\nthe relationship between these two forms of ancient skepticism. Vitor\nHirschbruch Schvartz (2012) defends a rustic interpretation of\nSextus Empiricus. Recent scholarship is improving, as is shown by the\nworks of Rodrigo Pinto de Brito (Brazil) (2014) on Sextus. \nMore recently, studies on ancient skepticism grew thanks to the works\nof Diego Machuca (Argentina) (2006a,b, 2009, 2013a). His Ph.D.\ndissertation was on Sextus’ ethics. Afterwards, he has published\nmany papers and reviews, as well as organized events. He has also\nedited a number of important collections on the history of skepticism\n(2011a,b, 2013b). It is fair to say that no one gave more impulse to\nimprove Latin American scholarship on ancient skepticism than he did.\nWith Duncan Pritchard, Machuca is the editor of the International\nJournal for the Study of Skepticism. Thus, both for his personal\npapers and books and for his involvement in organizing research,\nMachuca is a leading figure in ancient skepticism. \nColombia has also given its contribution to the field. In\nCuadernos de Filosofía y Letras, we find not only the\nfirst book of the Esbozos Pirrónicos of Sextus\nEmpiricus translated by the philologist and Hellenist Jorge\nPáramo (1989), but also many papers by scholars such as Popkin,\nGiorgio Tonelli, Porchat and Olaso, together with an examination of\nthe importance of philosophical skepticism by Carlos B.\nGutiérrez (Colombia) (1989). In Mexico, Ornelas (Mexico) (2013,\n2014b) read Sextus’ works carefully, and found theoretical\nresources that can help with the engagement with contemporary\nepistemological issues. \nStudies on the history of skepticism before the modern period are not\nrestricted to Pyrrhonism and Academic skepticism. It should not go\nunmentioned Maurício Pagotto Marsola’s paper (Brazil)\n(2007) on Plotinus and skepticism, for this is a very unexpected\naspect of Plotinus’ philosophy. In connection to the origins of\nMedieval Philosophy, and especially Augustine and Descartes, Luis\nBacigalupo (Peru) (1999) has also done some research. Rodrigo Pinto de\nBrito (Brazil) (2015) has been working on the impact of skepticism in\nChristian thought. \nOne should also pay attention to Mauricio Beuchot (Mexico) (1996,\n2003) who devoted two papers to skepticism in the Middle Age. His\npoint is that skepticism attracted some attention even before\nRenaissance. According to him, many medieval authors developed\nskeptical positions. Among them, Augustine’s Platonic\nChristianity appealed to Academic skepticism in its theory of\nillumination, in which Augustine emphasized the fallibility of human\nknowledge; Averroes’ theory of double truth, according to which\nthere are two kinds of truth (truths for science and truths for faith)\nsimilarly has a skeptical tone, and those who thought that God could\nperhaps fool us were considering skeptical argument (Ockham, Pedro\nLombardo, Tomás de Aquino and Buenaventura, among others).\nBeuchot also remembers that Nicolás d’Autrecourt, a\nFrench monk (1300–1350 approximately), active in the University\nof Paris, anticipated Humean skepticism concerning causality. \nPerhaps it should also be mentioned some other studies on the history\nof skepticism. On the one hand, there are some literary studies.\nMachado de Assis, one of the best Brazilian writers, has been seen as\na skeptic by many people. One reason is that Machado read and used\nextensively Montaigne’s skepticism. José Raimundo de Maia\nNeto (1994) published a book on the topic. The novelty of his book is\nthat it was the first discussion on Machado’s skepticism based\non the history of skepticism. Paulo Roberto Margutti Pinto (2007) and\nGustavo Bernardo Krause (2007a) discussed Maia Neto’s\ninterpretation, and Maia Neto replied to them. Krause is a Brazilian\nnovelist as well as a professor of literature who published many books\nand papers on skepticism and literature (Krause 2004), on Machado\n(Krause 2006) and other writers such as the well-known Brazilian poet\nCarlos Drummond de Andrade (Krause 2007b). On the other hand, Paulo\nRoberto Margutti Pinto has been studying the history of Brazilian\nphilosophy, in which he sees an important role for skepticism long\nbefore Porchat brought it to center stage. In Pinto 2010, he argues\nfor the influence of Francisco Sanches on Brazilian colonial thought.\nOne of the reasons for Porchat’s success is that it seems that\nBrazilian thought has always had, at least in some places, a tendency\ntowards skepticism. Machado de Assis would not be an exception.","contact.mail":"otaviobueno@mac.com","contact.domain":"mac.com"}]
