He was the last prominent figure in\nthe early Pythagorean tradition and the dominant political figure in\nTarentum, being elected general seven consecutive times. He sent a\nship to rescue Plato from the clutches of the tyrant of Syracuse,\nDionysius II, in 361, but his personal and philosophical connections\nto Plato are complex, and there are many signs of disagreement between\nthe two philosophers. A great number of pseudepigrapha were written in\nArchytas’ name starting in the first century BC, and only four\nfragments of his genuine work survive, although these are supplemented\nby a number of important testimonia. Archytas was the first to solve\none of the most celebrated mathematical problems in antiquity, the\nduplication of the cube. We also have his proof showing that ratios of\nthe form (n+1) : n, which are important in music\ntheory, cannot be divided by a mean proportional. He was the most\nsophisticated of the Pythagorean harmonic theorists and provided\nmathematical accounts of musical scales used by the practicing\nmusicians of his day. Fr. 1 of Archytas may be the earliest text to\nidentify the group of four canonical sciences (logistic [arithmetic],\ngeometry, astronomy and music), which would become known as the\nquadrivium in the middle ages. There are also some\nindications that he contributed to the development of the science of\noptics and laid the mathematical foundations for the science of\nmechanics. He saw the ultimate goal of the sciences as the description\nof individual things in the world in terms of ratio and proportion and\naccordingly regarded logistic, the science of number and proportion,\nas the master science. Rational calculation and an understanding of\nproportion were also the bases of the just state and of the good life\nfor an individual. He gave definitions of things that took account of\nboth their matter and their form. Although we have little information\nabout his cosmology, he developed the most famous argument for the\ninfinity of the universe in antiquity.\n\nArchytas, son of Hestiaeus (see Aristoxenus in Diels-Kranz 1952, chap.\n47, passage A1; abbreviated as DK47 A1), lived in the Greek city of\nTarentum, on the heel of the boot of Italy. The later tradition almost\nuniversally identifies him as a Pythagorean (e.g., A1, A2, A7, A16).\nAristotle and his pupil Eudemus do not explicitly call Archytas a\nPythagorean and appear to treat him as an important independent\nthinker. Plato never refers to Archytas by name except in the\nSeventh Letter, if that is by Plato, and he is not called a\nPythagorean there. In the Republic, however, when Plato\nquotes a sentence which appears in Fr. 1 of Archytas (DK47 B1), he\nexplicitly labels it as part of Pythagorean harmonics (530d). Cicero\n(de Orat. III 34. 139) reports that Archytas was the pupil of\nPhilolaus, and this is not improbable. Philolaus was the most\nprominent Pythagorean of the preceding generation (ca. 470–390)\nand may have taught in Tarentum. Archytas’ achievements in\nmathematics depend on the work of Hippocrates of Chios, but we have no\nevidence that he studied with Hippocrates. The only pupil of Archytas\nwho is more than a name, is Eudoxus (ca. 390–340), the prominent\nmathematician. Eudoxus presumably did not learn his famous hedonism\nfrom Archytas (see DK47 A9), and it is specifically geometry that he\nis said to have studied with Archytas (Diogenes Laertius VIII 86). \nArchytas was, roughly speaking, a contemporary of Plato, but it is\ndifficult to be more precise about his dates. Aristotle’s pupil,\nEudemus, presents him as the contemporary of Plato (born 428/7) and\nLeodamas (born ca. 430), on the one hand, and of Theaetetus (born ca.\n415), on the other (A6). Since it would be difficult to call him the\ncontemporary of Theaetetus, if he were born much earlier than 435,\nthis is the earliest he was likely to have been born. On the other\nhand, he could have been born as late as 410 and still be considered a\ncontemporary of Plato. Strabo associates Archytas with the flourishing\nof Tarentum, before a period of decline, in which Tarentum hired\nmercenary generals (A4). Since the mercenaries appear ca. 340, it\nseems likely that Archytas was dead by 350 at the latest. Such a date\nis in accord with other evidence (A5 = [Demosthenes], Erot.\nOr. 61.46), which connects Archytas to Timotheus, who died ca.\n355, and with Plato’s (?) Seventh Letter (350a), which\npresents Archytas as still active in Tarentum in 361. Thus Archytas\nwas born between 435 and 410 and died between 360 and 350. \nSome scholars (e.g., Ciaceri 1927–32: III 4) have supposed that\nthe speaker of the Roman poet, Horace’s, Archytas Ode (I 28 =\nA3) is Archytas himself and hence have concluded that Archytas died in\na shipwreck. The standard interpretation, however, rightly recognizes\nthat the speaker is not Archytas but a shipwrecked sailor who\napostrophizes Archytas (Nisbet and Hubbard 1970, 317ff.). The ode\ntells us nothing about Archytas’ death, but it is one of many\npieces of evidence for the fascination with Archytas by Roman authors\nof the first century BC (Propertius IV 1b.77; Varro in B8; Cicero,\nRep. I 38.59, I 10.16; Fin. V 29.87; Tusc.\nIV 36.78, V 23.64, de Orat. III 34.139; Amic. XXIII\n88; Sen. XII 39–41), perhaps because Pythagoreanism had\ncome to be seen as a native Italian philosophy, and not a Greek import\n(Burkert 1961; Powell 1995, 11 ff.). \nApart from the surviving fragments of his writings, our knowledge of\nArchytas’ life and work depends heavily on authors who wrote in\nthe second half of the fourth century, in the fifty years after\nArchytas’ death. Archytas’ importance both as an\nintellectual and as a political leader is reflected in the number of\nwritings about him in this period, although only fragments of these\nworks have been preserved. Aristotle wrote a work in three volumes on\nthe philosophy of Archytas, more than on any other of his\npredecessors, as well as a second work, consisting of a summary of\nPlato’s Timaeus and the writings of Archytas (A13).\nUnfortunately almost nothing of these works has survived. Scholars\nhave generally regarded them as authentic (Huffman 2005: 583–94)\nbut Schofield has recently raised some doubts (2014: 81–2).\nAristotle’s pupil Eudemus discussed Archytas prominently in his\nhistory of geometry (A6 and A14) and in his work on physics (A23 and\nA24). Another pupil of Aristotle’s, Aristoxenus, wrote a\nLife of Archytas, which is the basis for much of the\nbiographical tradition about him (A1, A7, A9). Aristoxenus (375-ca.\n300) was in a good position to have accurate information about\nArchytas. He was born in Tarentum and grew up during the height of\nArchytas’ prominence in the city. In addition to whatever\npersonal knowledge he had of Archytas, he draws on his own father\nSpintharus, who was a younger contemporary of Archytas, as a source\n(e.g., A7). Aristoxenus began his philosophical career as a\nPythagorean and studied with the Pythagorean Xenophilus at Athens, so\nthat it is not surprising that his portrayal of Archytas is largely\npositive. Nonetheless, Archytas’ opponents are given a fair\nhearing (e.g., Polyarchus in A9), and Archytas himself is represented\nas not without small flaws of character (A7). Other fourth-century\nsources such as the Seventh Letter in the Platonic corpus and\nDemosthenes’ (?) Erotic Oration focus on the connection\nbetween Archytas and Plato (see below). \nArchytas is unique among Greek philosophers for the prominent role he\nplayed in the politics of his native city. He was elected general\n(stratêgos) seven years in succession at one point in\nhis career (A1), a record that reminds us of Pericles at Athens. His\nelection was an exception to a law, which forbade election in\nsuccessive years, and thus attests to his reputation in Tarentum.\nAristoxenus reports that Archytas was never defeated in battle and\nthat, when at one point he was forced to withdraw from his post by the\nenvy of his enemies, the Tarentines immediately suffered defeat (A1).\nHe probably served as part of a board of generals (there was a board\nof ten at Athens). The analogy with Athens suggests that as a general\nhe may also have had special privileges in addressing the assembly at\nTarentum on issues of importance to the city, so that his position as\ngeneral gave him considerable political as well as military power. At\nsome point in his career, he may have been designated as a general\nautokratôr (“plenipotentiary”) (A2), which\ngave him special latitude in dealing with diplomatic and military\nmatters without consulting the assembly, although this was not\ndictatorial power and all arrangements probably required the eventual\napproval of the assembly. We do not know when Archytas served his\nseven successive years as general. Some have supposed that they must\ncoincide with the seven year period which includes Plato’s\nsecond and third visits to Italy and Sicily, 367–361 (e.g.,\nWuilleumier 1939, 68–9), but Archytas need not have been\nstratêgos to play the role assigned to him during these\nyears in the Seventh Letter. The evidence suggests that most\nof Archytas’ military campaigns were directed not at other\nGreeks but at native Italic peoples such as the Messapians and\nLucanians, with whom Tarentum had been in constant conflict since its\nfounding. \nIt is important to recognize that the Tarentum in which Archytas\nexercised such influence was not some insignificant backwater. Spartan\ncolonists founded it in 706. It was initially overshadowed by other\nGreek colonies in southern Italy such as Croton, although it had the\nbest harbor on the south coast of Italy and was the natural stopping\npoint for any ships sailing west from mainland Greece. Archytas will\nhave grown up in a Tarentum that, in accord with its foundation by\nSparta, took the Peloponnesian and Syracusan side against Athens in\nthe Peloponnesian War (Thuc. VI 44; VI 104; VII 91). Athens allied\nwith the Messapians (Thuc. VII 33), the long-standing enemy of the\nTarentines, against whom Archytas would later lead expeditions (A7).\nAfter the Peloponnesian War, Tarentum appears to have avoided direct\ninvolvement in the conflict between the tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius\nI, and a league of Greek cities in southern Italy headed by Croton.\nAfter Dionysius crushed the league, Tarentum emerged as the most\npowerful Greek state in southern Italy and probably became the new\nhead of the league of Italiot Greek cities (A2). In the period from\n380–350, when Archytas was in his prime and old age, Tarentum\nwas one of the most powerful cities in the Greek world (Purcell 1994,\n388). Strabo’s description of its military might (VI 3.4)\ncompares favorably with Thucydides’ account of Athens at the\nbeginning of the Peloponnesian war (II. 13). \nDespite its ancestral connections to Sparta, which was an oligarchy,\nTarentum appears to have been a democracy during Archytas’\nlifetime. According to Aristotle (Pol. 1303a), the democracy\nwas founded after a large part of the Tarentine aristocracy was killed\nin a battle with a native people, the Iapygians, in 473. Herodotus\nconfirms that this was the greatest slaughter of Greeks of which he\nwas aware (VII 170). There is no evidence that Tarentum was anything\nbut a democracy between the founding of the democracy in 473 and\nArchytas’ death ca. 350. Some scholars have argued that\nTarentum’s ties to Sparta and the supposed predilection of the\nPythagoreans for aristocracy will have insured that Tarentum did not\nremain a democracy long and that it was not a democracy under Archytas\n(Minar 1942, 88–90; Ciaceri 1927–32, II 446–7).\nStrabo, however, explicitly describes Tarentum as a democracy at the\ntime of its flourishing under Archytas (A4), and the descriptions of\nArchytas’ power in Tarentum stress his popularity with the\nmasses and his election as general by the citizens (A1 and A2).\nFinally, Aristotle’s account of the structure of the Tarentine\ngovernment in the fourth century (Pol. 1291b14), while\npossibly consistent with other forms of government, makes most sense\nif Tarentum was a democracy. The same is true of fr. B3 of Archytas,\nwith its emphasis on a more equal distribution of wealth. \nArchytas was most famous in antiquity and is most famous in the modern\nworld for having sent a ship to rescue Plato from the tyrant of\nSyracuse, Dionysius II, in 361. In both the surviving ancient lives of\nArchytas (by Diogenes Laertius, VIII 79–83, and in the\nSuda) the first thing mentioned about him, after the name of\nhis city-state and his father, is his rescue of Plato (A1 and A2).\nThis story is told in greatest detail in the Seventh Letter\nascribed to Plato. It has accordingly been typical to identify\nArchytas as “the friend of Plato” (Mathieu 1987). Archytas\nfirst met Plato over twenty years earlier, when Plato visited southern\nItaly and Sicily for the first time in 388/7, during his travels after\nthe death of Socrates (Pl. [?], Ep. VII 324a, 326b-d; Cicero,\nRep. I 10. 16; Philodemus, Acad. Ind. X 5–11;\ncf. D.L. III 6). Some scholars have seen Archytas as the dominant\nfigure in the relationship (Zhmud 2006, 93) and even as the “new\nmodel philosopher for Plato” (Vlastos 1991, 129) and the\narchetype of Plato’s philosopher-king (Guthrie 1962, 333). The\nactual situation appears to be considerably more complicated. The\nancient evidence, apart from the Seventh Letter, presents the\nrelationship between Archytas and Plato in diametrically opposed ways.\nOne tradition does present Archytas as the Pythagorean master at whose\nfeet Plato sat, after Socrates had died (e.g., Cicero, Rep. I\n10.16), but another tradition makes Archytas the student of Plato, to\nwhom he owed his fame and success in Tarentum (Demosthenes [?],\nErotic Oration 44). \nThe Seventh Letter itself is of contested authenticity. Many\nscholars regard it either as the work of Plato himself or of a student\nof Plato who had considerable familiarity with Plato’s\ninvolvement in events in Sicily (see e.g., Brisson 1987; Lloyd 1990;\nSchofield 2000), but grave doubts about this view have been raised by\nBurnyeat and Frede (2015). The letter appears to serve as an apologia\nfor Plato’s involvement in events in Sicily. Lloyd has argued,\nhowever, that the letter also serves to distance Plato from\nPythagoreanism and from Archytas (1990). Nothing in the letter\nsuggests that Plato was ever the pupil of Archytas; instead the\nrelationship is much closer to that presented in the Erotic\nOration. Plato is presented as the dominant figure upon whom\nArchytas depends both philosophically and politically. Archytas writes\nto Plato claiming that Dionysius II has made great progress in\nphilosophy, in order to urge Plato to come to Sicily a third time\n(339d-e). These claims are belied as soon as Plato arrives (340b). The\nletter thus suggests that, far from being the Pythagorean master from\nwhom Plato learned his philosophy, Archytas had a very imperfect\nunderstanding of what Plato considered philosophy to be. The letter\nmakes clear that Plato does have a relationship of xenia,\n“guest-friendship,” with Archytas and others at Tarentum\n(339e, 350a). This relationship could have been established on\nPlato’s first visit in 388/7, since Plato uses it as a basis to\nestablish a similar relationship between Archytas and Dionysius II\nduring his second visit in 367 (338c). It is also the relationship in\nterms of which Plato appeals to Archytas for help, when he is in\ndanger after the third trip to Sicily goes badly (350a). Such a\nfriendship need not imply any close personal intimacy, however.\nAristotle classifies xenia as a friendship for utility and\npoints out that such friends do not necessarily spend much time\ntogether or even find each other’s company pleasant (EN\n1156a26 ff.). Apart from Archytas’ rescue of Plato in 361 (even\nthis is described as devised by Plato [350a]), Plato is clearly the\ndominant figure in the relationship. Archytas is portrayed as\nPlato’s inferior in his understanding of philosophy, and Plato\nis even presented as responsible for some of Archytas’ political\nsuccess, insofar as he establishes the relationship between Archytas\nand Dionysius II, which is described as of considerable political\nimportance (339d). \nHow are we to unravel the true nature of the relationship between\nPlato and Archytas in the light of this conflicting evidence? Apart\nfrom the Seventh Letter, Plato never makes a direct reference\nto Archytas. He does, however, virtually quote a sentence from\nArchytas’ book on harmonics in Book VII of the Republic\n(530d), and his discussions of the science of stereometry shortly\nbefore this are likely to have some connections to Archytas’\nwork in solid geometry (528d). It is thus in the context of the\ndiscussion of the sciences that Plato refers to Archytas, and the\nremains of Archytas’ work focus precisely on the sciences (e.g.,\nfr. B1). Both strands of the tradition can be reconciled, if we\nsuppose that Plato’s first visit to Italy and Sicily was at\nleast in part motivated by his desire to meet Archytas, as the first\ntradition claims, but that he sought Archytas out not as a new\n“model philosopher” but rather as an expert in the\nmathematical sciences, in which Plato had developed a deep interest.\nIn Republic VII, Plato is critical of Pythagorean harmonics\nand of current work in solid geometry on philosophical grounds, so\nthat, while he undoubtedly learned a considerable amount of\nmathematics from Archytas, he clearly disagreed with Archytas’\nunderstanding of the philosophical uses of the sciences. In 388\nTarentum had not yet reached the height of its power, and Archytas is\nnot likely to have achieved his political dominance yet, so that there\nmay also be some truth to the claim of the second tradition that\nArchytas did not achieve his great practical success until after his\ncontact with Plato; whether or not that success had any direct\nrelationship to his contact with Plato is more doubtful. On their\nfirst meeting in 388/7, Plato and Archytas established a relationship\nof guest-friendship, which obligated them to further each\nother’s interests, which they did, as the events of\n367–361 show. Plato and Archytas need not have been in agreement\non philosophical issues and are perhaps better seen as competitive\ncolleagues engaged in an ongoing debate as to the value of the\nsciences for philosophy (Huffman 2005, 32–42). \nMore pages of text have been preserved in Archytas’ name than in\nthe name of any other Pythagorean. Unfortunately the vast majority of\nthis material is rightly regarded as spurious. The same is true of the\nPythagorean tradition in general; the vast majority of texts which\npurport to be by early Pythagoreans are, in fact, later forgeries.\nSome of these forgeries were produced for purely monetary reasons; a\ntext of a “rare” work by a famous Pythagorean could fetch\na considerable sum from book collectors. There were characteristics\nunique to the Pythagorean tradition, however, that led to a\nproliferation of forgeries. Starting as early as the later fourth\ncentury BC, Pythagoras came to be regarded, in some circles, as the\nphilosopher par excellence, to whom all truth had been revealed. All\nlater philosophy, insofar as it was true, was a restatement of this\noriginal revelation (see, e.g., O’Meara 1989). In order to\nsupport this view of Pythagoras, texts were forged in the name of\nPythagoras and other early Pythagoreans, to show that they had, in\nfact, anticipated the most important ideas of Plato and Aristotle.\nThese pseudo-Pythagorean texts are thus characterized by the use of\ncentral Platonic and Aristotelian ideas, expressed in the technical\nterminology used by Plato and Aristotle. Some of the forgeries even\nattempt to improve on Plato and Aristotle by adding refinements to\ntheir positions, which were first advanced several hundred years after\ntheir deaths. The date and place of origin of these pseudo-Pythagorean\ntreatises is difficult to determine, but most seem to have been\ncomposed between 150 BC and 100 AD (Burkert 1972b; Centrone 1990;\nMoraux 1984); Rome (Burkert 1972b) and Alexandria (Centrone 1990) are\nthe most likely places of origin. Archytas is the dominant figure in\nthis pseudo-Pythagorean tradition, probably because of his connection\nto Plato (Zhmud 2019). In Thesleff 1965’s collection of the\npseudo-Pythagorean writings, forty-five of the two-hundred and\nforty-five pages (2-48), about 20%, comprising some 1,200 lines, are\ndevoted to texts forged in Archytas’ name. On the other hand,\nthe fragments likely to be genuine, which are collected in DK, fill\nout only a hundred lines of text. Thus, over ten times more spurious\nthan genuine material has been preserved in Archytas’ name. It\nmay well be that the style and Doric dialect of the pseudo-Pythagorean\nwritings were also based on the model of Archytas’ genuine\nwritings. \nThe treatises under Archytas’ name collected in Thesleff 1965\nhave been almost universally regarded as not by the historical\nArchytas, except for On Law and Justice, where there has been\nconsiderable controversy. Most are only preserved in fragments,\nalthough there are two brief complete works. The most famous of these\npseudepigrapha is Concerning the Whole System [sc. of\nCategories] or Concerning the Ten Categories (preserved\ncomplete, see Szlezak 1972). This work along with the treatise On\nOpposites (Thesleff 1965, 15.3–19.2) and the much later\nTen Universal Assertions (preserved complete, first ascribed\nto Archytas in the 15th century AD; see Szlezak 1972)\nrepresent the attempt to claim Aristotle’s doctrine of\ncategories for Archytas and the Pythagoreans (see also Griffin 2015).\nThis attempt was to some extent successful; both Simplicius and\nIamblichus regarded the Archytan works on categories as genuine\nanticipations of Aristotle (CAG VIII. 2, 9–25).\nConcerning the Ten Categories and On Opposites are\nvery frequently cited in the ancient commentaries on Aristotle’s\nCategories. Pseudo-Archytas identifies ten categories with\nnames that are virtually identical to those used by Aristotle, and his\nlanguage follows Aristotle closely in many places. The division of\nArchytas’ work into two treatises, Concerning the Ten\nCategories and On Opposites, reflects the work of\nAndronicus of Rhodes, who first separated the last six chapters of\nAristotle’s Categories from the rest. Thus, the works\nin Archytas’ name must have been composed after\nAndronicus’ work in the first century BC. Other pseudepigrapha\nin metaphysics and epistemology include On Principles\n(Thesleff 1965, 19.3 – 20.17) and On Intelligence and\nPerception (Thesleff 1965, 36.12–39.25), which includes a\nparaphrase of the divided line passage in Plato’s\nRepublic. Mansfeld has recently shown that Fragment 1 of the\nlatter work in Thesleff’s collection belongs to the former work\n(Mansfeld 2019). De Cesaris and Horky (2018) provide commentary on\nOn Intelligence and Perception, but much remains obscure in\nthis difficult work. Mansfeld (2019) shows that On Intelligence\nand Perception is not likely to have been an influence on the\naccount of Pythagorean principles in Aetius Placita 1.3.8 as\nhas been suggested by De Cesaris and Horky (2018). Ulacco (2017)\nestablishes new texts (with commentary) for On Principles,\nOn Intelligence and Perception and On Opposites.\nFurther metaphysical and epistemological works include On\nBeing (Thesleff 1965, 40.1–16) and On Wisdom\n(Thesleff 1965, 43.24–45.4). The authenticity of this latter\nwork has recently been defended on the grounds that its admitted\nsimilarities to passages in Aristotle are a result of Archytas’\ninfluence on Aristotle rather than an indication that the work was\nforged on the basis of Aristotle (Johnson 2008, 193–194). It is\nindeed true that Aristotle devoted several lost works to Archytas and\nmust have been familiar with his thought. However, the issue of\nauthenticity within the Pythagorean tradition has a different\ncharacter than is the case with other ancient authors. In the case of\nan author such as Plato, where the vast majority of surviving works\nare surely authentic, the onus of proof is on anyone who wants to\nargue that a work is spurious. In the Pythagorean tradition, on the\nother hand, where surely spurious works far outnumber genuine ones,\nthe situation is reversed. The onus of proof rests on anyone who\nregards a Pythagorean work as genuine to show that it does not fit the\npattern of the forged Pythagorean treatises and that its contents can\nbe corroborated by evidence dating before the third century, when the\nPythagorean pseudepigrapha start to be generated. Since On\nWisdom does share with the pseudepigrapha the characteristic of\nusing important Aristotelian distinctions (Huffman 2005,\n598–599), even if it is not as blatant a copy of\nAristotle’s ideas as the works on categories ascribed to\nArchytas, it is much more likely that it was forged on the basis of\nAristotle than that Aristotle is using On Wisdom without\nattribution. In order for the latter situation to be probable there\nwould need to be fourth-century evidence independent of On\nWisdom which ascribed the ideas found in it to Archytas. Horky\n2015 includes On Wisdom among the pseudepigrapha and provides\nanalysis of it. For recent discussions of the nature of the\npseudepigrapha ascribed to Archytas see Bonazzi 2013 and Centrone\n2014. For the nature of the appropriation of Aristotle in\npseudepigrapha ascribed to Archytas and other early Pythagoreans see\nUlacco 2016. \nThere are also fragments of two pseudepigrapha on ethics and politics,\nwhich have recent editions with commentary: On the Good and Happy\nMan (Centrone 1990), which shows connections to Arius Didymus, an\nauthor of the first century BC, and On Moral Education\n(Centrone 1990), which has ties to Carneades (2nd c. BC). The status\nof one final treatise is less clear. The fragments of On Law and\nJustice (Thesleff 1965, 33.1–36.11) were studied in some\ndetail by Delatte (1922), who showed that the treatise deals with the\npolitical conceptions of the fourth century and who came to the modest\nconclusion that the work might be by Archytas, since there were no\npositive indications of late composition. Thesleff similarly concluded\nthat the treatise “may be authentic or at least comparatively\nold” (1961, 112), while Minar maintained that “it has an\nexcellent claim to authenticity” (1942, 111). Its authenticity\nwas supported by Johnson (2008, 194–198) but more recently Horky\nand Johnson argue that it was not written by Archytas himself and\npropose the somewhat Byzantine theory that it was written by an author\nwho based it on a speech which they hypothesize that Aristoxenus\nassigned to Archytas in his Life of Archytas (2020:\n459–460). On the other hand, DK did not include the fragments of\nOn Law and Justice among the genuine fragments, and most\nrecent scholars have argued that the treatise is spurious. Aalders\nprovides the most detailed treatment, although a number of his\narguments are inconclusive (1968, 13–20). Other opponents of\nauthenticity are Burkert (1972a), Moraux (1984, 670–677),\nCentrone (2000) and most recently Schofield (2014). The connections of\nOn Law and Justice to the genuine Fr. B2 of Archytas speak\nfor its authenticity, but its similarities, sometimes word for word,\nto pseudo-Pythagorean treatises by “Diotogenes” (Thesleff\n76.2–3, 71. 21–2), “Damippos” (Thesleff 68.26)\nand “Metopos” (Thesleff 119.28) argue for its\nspuriousness. Moreover, the authentic Fr. 3 of Archytas shows that\ncalculation (logismos) was the key concept in his political\nphilosophy. Its total absence from On Law and Justice, whose\nfocus is political philosophy, along with the absence of other key\nterms in Fr. 3 (e.g., pleonexia,  homonoia and\nisotēs) is hard to explain, if On Law and\nJustice is authentic (Huffman 2005, 599–606). For a recent\nargument against the authenticity of On Law and Justice,\nwhich further contrasts it with the authentic Fr. 3, see Schofield\n2014: 82–5. Even if the work belongs among the pseudepigrapha\nHorky and Johnson are surely right that the controversy about its\nauthenticity has led scholars to neglect the philosophic content of\nthe treatise (Horky and Johnson 2020: 487) and they provide a\ncommentary that attempts to elucidate this difficult text. They regard\nthe text as closely tied to genuine fragments of Archytas and suggest\nthat it can help us understand those fragments, but the similarities\nare of a very general sort. As Zhmud has recently argued there is very\nlittle that is genuinely Pythagorean in the pseudepigrapha (Zhmud\n2019) and that also appears to be true of On Law and Justice.\n \nSome testimonia suggest that there were even more pseudo-Archytan\ntreatises, which have not survived even in fragments (Thesleff 47.8\nff.). Two spurious letters of Archytas survive. One is the letter to\nwhich the pseudo-Platonic Twelfth Letter is responding (D.L.\nVIII 79–80), and the other is the purported letter of Archytas\nto Dionysius II, which was sent along with the ship in order to secure\nPlato’s release in 361 (D.L. III 21–2). Archytas was a\npopular figure in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance, when works\ncontinued to be written in his name, usually with the spelling\nArchitas or Archita. The Ars geometriae, which is ascribed to\nBoethius, but was in reality composed in the 12th century\n(Folkerts 1970, 105), ascribes discoveries in mathematics to Architas\nwhich are clearly spurious (Burkert 1972a, 406). Several alchemical\nrecipes involving the wax of the left ear of a dog and the heart of a\nwolf are ascribed to Architas in ps.-Albertus Magnus, The Marvels\nof the World (De mirabilibus mundi –\n13th century AD). Numerous selections from a book entitled\nOn Events in Nature (de eventibus in natura, also\ncited as de effectibus in natura and as de eventibus\nfuturorum) by Archita Tharentinus (or Tharentinus, or just\nTharen) are preserved in the medieval texts known as The Light of\nthe Soul (Lumen Animae), which were composed in the\nfourteenth century and circulated widely in Europe in the fifteenth\ncentury as a manual for preachers (Rouse 1971; Thorndike 1934, III\n546–60). An apocryphal work, The Circular Theory of the\nThings in the Heaven, by Archytas Maximus [!], which has never\nbeen published in full, is preserved in Codex Ambrosianus D 27 sup.\n(See Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum Graecorum, ed. F. Cumont\net al., Vol. III, p. 11).  \nNo list of Archytas’ works has come down to us from antiquity,\nso that we don’t know how many books he wrote. In the face of\nthe large mass of spurious works, it is disappointing that only a few\nfragments of genuine works have survived. Most scholars accept as\ngenuine the four fragments printed by Diels and Kranz (B1–4).\nBurkert (1972a, 220 n.14 and 379 n. 46) raised some concerns about the\nauthenticity of even some of these fragments, but see the responses of\nBowen (1982) and Huffman (1985 and 2005). Our evidence for the titles\nof Archytas’ genuine writings depends largely on the citations\ngiven by the authors who quote the fragments. Fragments B1 and B2 are\nreported to come from a treatise entitled Harmonics, and the\nmajor testimonia about Archytas’ harmonic theory are likely to\nbe ultimately based on this book (A16–19). This treatise began\nwith a discussion of the basic principles of acoustics (B1), defined\nthe three types of mean which are of importance in music theory (B2),\nand went on to present Archytas’ mathematical descriptions of\nthe tetrachord (the fourth) in the three main genera (chromatic,\ndiatonic, and enharmonic – A16-A19). B3 probably comes from a\nwork On Sciences, which may have been a more general\ndiscussion of the value of mathematics for human life in general and\nfor the establishment of a just state in particular. New support for\nits authenticity has been provided by Schofield (2009). B4 comes from\na work entitled Discourses (Diatribai). The fragment\nitself asserts the priority of the science of calculation (ha\nlogistika, “logistic”) to the other sciences, such as\ngeometry, and thus suggests a technical work of mathematics. The title\nDiatribai would more normally suggest a treatise of ethical\ncontent, however, so that in this work the sciences may have been\nevaluated in terms of their contribution to the wisdom that leads to a\ngood life. \nA relatively rich set of testimonia, many from authors of the fourth\ncentury BC, indicate that Archytas wrote other books as well.\nArchytas’ famous argument for the unlimited extent of the\nuniverse (A24), his theory of vision (A25), and his account of motion\n(A23, A23a) all suggest that he may have written a work on cosmology.\nAristotle’s comments in the Metaphysics suggest that\nArchytas may have written a book on definition (A22), and A20 and A21\nmight suggest a work on arithmetic. Perhaps there was a treatise on\ngeometry or solid geometry in which Archytas’ solution to the\nproblem of doubling the cube (A14–15) was published. There is\nalso a tradition of anecdotes about Archytas, which probably\nultimately derives from Aristoxenus’ Life of Archytas\n(A7, A8, A9, A11). It is possible that even the testimonia for\nArchytas’ argument for an unlimited universe and his theory of\nvision were derived from anecdotes preserved by Aristoxenus, and not\nat all from works of Archytas’ own. \nIt is uncertain whether the treatises On Flutes (B6), On\nMachines (B1 and B7), and On Agriculture (B1 and B8),\nwhich were in circulation under the name of Archytas, were in fact by\nArchytas of Tarentum or by other men of the same name. Diogenes\nLaertius lists three other writers with the name Archytas (VIII 82).\nThe treatise On the Decad mentioned by Theon (B5) might be by\nArchytas, but the treatise by Philolaus with which it is paired is\nspurious (Huffman 1993, 347–350), thus suggesting that the same\nmay be true of the treatise under Archytas’ name. \nArchytas was the first person to arrive at a solution to one of the\nmost famous mathematical puzzles in antiquity, the duplication of the\ncube. The most romantic version of the story, which occurs in many\nvariations and ultimately goes back to Eratosthenes (3rd c. BC),\nreports that the inhabitants of the Greek island of Delos were beset\nby a plague and, when they consulted an oracle for advice, were told\nthat, if they doubled the size of a certain altar, which had the form\nof a cube, the plague would stop (Eutocius, in Archim. sphaer. et\ncyl. II [III 88.3–96.27 Heiberg/Stamatis]). The\nsimple-minded response to the oracle, which is actually assigned to\nthe Delians in some versions, is to build a second altar identical to\nthe first one and set it on top of the first (Philoponus, In Anal.\npost., CAG XIII.3, 102.12–22). The resulting altar does\nindeed have a volume twice that of the first altar, but it is no\nlonger a cube. The next simple-minded response is to assume that,\nsince we want an altar that is double in volume, while still remaining\na cube, we should build the new altar with a side that is double the\nlength of the side of the original altar. This approach fails as well.\nDoubling the side of the altar produces a new altar that is not twice\nthe volume of the original altar but eight times the volume. If the\noriginal altar had a side of two, then its volume would be\n23 or 8, while an altar built on a side twice as long will\nhave a volume of 43 or 64. What then is the length of the\nside which will produce a cube with twice the volume of the original\ncube? The Delians were at a loss and presented their problem to Plato\nin the Academy. Plato then posed the “Delian Problem,” as\nit came to be known, to mathematicians associated with the Academy,\nand no less than three solutions were devised, those of Eudoxus,\nMenaechmus, and Archytas. \nIt is not clear whether or not the story about the Delians has any\nbasis in fact. Even if it does, it should not be understood to suggest\nthat the problem of doubling the cube first arose in the fourth\ncentury with the Delians. We are told that the mathematician,\nHippocrates of Chios, who was active in the second half of the fifth\ncentury, had already confronted the problem and had reduced it to a\nslightly different problem (Eutocius, in Archim. sphaer. et\ncyl. II [III 88.3–96.27 Heiberg/Stamatis]). Hippocrates\nrecognized that if we could find two mean proportionals between the\nlength of the side of the original cube G, and length D, where D = 2G,\nso that G : x :: x : y :: y : D, then the cube on length x will be\ndouble the cube on length G. Exactly how Hippocrates came to see this\nis conjectural and need not concern us here, but that he was right can\nbe seen relatively easily. Each of the values in the continued\nproportion G : x :: x : y :: y : D is equal to G : x, so we can set\nthem all equal to G : x. If we do this and multiply the three ratios\ntogether we get the value G3 : x3. On the other\nhand, if we take the same continued proportion and carry out the\nmultiplication in the original terms, then G : x times x : y yields G\n: y, and G : y times the remaining term gives G : D. Thus G : D =\nG3 : x3, but D is twice G so x3 is\ntwice G3. Remember that G was the length of the side of the\noriginal cube, so the cube that is twice the cube built on G, will be\nthe cube built on x. The Greeks did not think of the problem as a\nproblem in algebra but rather as a problem in geometry. After\nHippocrates the problem of doubling the cube was always seen as the\nproblem of finding two lines such that they were mean proportionals\nbetween G, the length of the side of the original cube, and D, a\nlength which is double G. It was to this form of the problem that\nArchytas provided the first solution. \nArchytas’ solution has been rightly hailed as “the most\nremarkable of all [the solutions]” and as a “bold\nconstruction in three dimensions” (Heath 1921, 246); Mueller\ncalls it “a tour de force of the spatial\nimagination” (1997, 312 n. 23). We owe the preservation of\nArchytas’ solution to Eutocius, who in the sixth century AD\ncollected some eleven solutions to the problem as part of his\ncommentary on the second book of Archimedes’ On the Sphere\nand Cylinder. Eutocius’ source for Archytas’ solution\nwas ultimately Aristotle’s pupil Eudemus, who in the late fourth\ncentury BC wrote a history of geometry. The solution is complex and it\nis not possible to go through it step by step here (see Huffman 2005,\n342–401 for a detailed treatment of the solution). Archytas\nproceeds by constructing a series of four similar triangles (see\nFigure 1 below) and then showing that the sides are proportional so\nthat AM : AI :: AI : AK :: AK : AD, where AM was equal to the side of\nthe original cube (G) and AD was twice AM. Thus the cube double the\nvolume of the cube on AM should be built on AI. The real difficulty\nwas in constructing the four similar triangles, where the given length\nof the side of the original cube and a length double that magnitude\nwere two of the sides in the similar triangles. The key point for the\nconstruction of these triangles, point K, was determined as the\nintersection of two rotating plane figures. The first figure is a\nsemicircle, which is perpendicular to the plane of the circle ABDZ and\nwhich starts on the diameter AED and, with point A remaining fixed,\nrotates to position AKD. The second is the triangle APD, which rotates\nup out of the plane of the circle ABDZ to position ALD. As each of\nthese figures rotates, it traces a line on the surface of a\nsemicylinder, which is perpendicular to the plane of ABDZ and has ABD\nas its base. The boldness and the imagination of the construction lies\nin envisioning the intersection at point K of the line drawn by the\nrotating semicircle on the surface of the semicylinder with the line\ndrawn by the rotating triangle on the same surface. We simply\ndon’t know what led Archytas to produce this amazing feat of\nspatial imagination, in order to construct the triangles with the\nsides in appropriate proportion. For a recent attempt to situate\nArchytas’ solution in the mathematics of his time and make it\nless “miraculous,” see Menn 2015.  \nIn the later tradition, Plato is reported to have criticized\nArchytas’ solution for appealing to “constructions that\nuse instruments and that are mechanical” (Plutarch, Table\nTalk VIII 2.1 [718e]; Marc. XIV 5–6). Plato argued\nthat the value of geometry and of the rest of mathematics resided in\ntheir ability to turn the soul from the sensible to intelligible\nrealm. The cube with which geometry deals is not a physical cube or\neven a drawing of a cube but rather an intelligible cube that fits the\ndefinition of the cube but is not a sense object. By employing\nphysical instruments, which “required much common\nhandicraft,” and in effect constructing machines to determine\nthe two mean proportionals, Archytas was focusing not on the\nintelligible world but on the physical world and hence destroying the\nvalue of geometry. Plato’s quarrel with Archytas is a charming\nstory, but it is hard to reconcile with Archytas’ actual\nsolution, which, as we have seen, makes no appeal to any instruments\nor machines. The story of the quarrel, which is first reported in\nPlutarch in the first century AD, is also hard to reconcile with our\nearliest source for the story of the Delian problem, Eratosthenes.\nEratosthenes had himself invented an instrument to determine mean\nproportionals, the mesolab (“mean-getter”), and\nhe tells the story of the Delian problem precisely to emphasize that\nearlier solutions, including that of Archytas, were in the form of\ngeometrical demonstrations, which could not be employed for practical\npurposes. He specifically labels Archytas’ solution as\ndysmêchana, “hardly mechanical.” Some\nscholars attempt to reconcile Plutarch’s and Eratosthenes’\nversions by focusing on their different literary goals (Knorr 1986,\n22; van der Waerden 1963, 161; Wolfer 1954, 12 ff.; Sachs 1917, 150);\nsome suggest that the rotation of the semicircle and the triangle in\nArchytas’ solution, might be regarded as mechanical, since\nmotion is involved (Knorr 1986, 22). It may be, however, that\nPlutarch’s story of a quarrel between Plato and Archytas over\nthe use of mechanical devices in geometry is an invention of the later\ntradition (Riginos 1976, 146; Zhmud 1998, 217) and perhaps served as a\nsort of foundation myth for the science of mechanics, a myth which\nexplained the separation of mechanics from philosophy as the result of\na quarrel between two philosophers. In the Republic, Plato is\ncritical of the solid geometry of his day, but his criticism makes no\nmention of the use of instruments. His criticism instead focuses on\nthe failure of solid geometry to be developed into a coherent\ndiscipline alongside geometry and astronomy (528b-d). This neglect of\nsolid geometry is ascribed to the failure of the Greek city-states to\nhold these difficult studies in honor, the lack of a director to\norganize the studies, and the arrogance of the current experts in the\nfield, who would not submit to such a director. Since Archytas’\nduplication of the cube shows him to be one of the leading solid\ngeometers of the time, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Plato\nregarded him as one of the arrogant experts, who focused on solving\ncharming problems but failed to produce a coherent discipline of solid\ngeometry. Since Archytas was a leading political figure in Tarentum,\nit is also possible that Plato was criticizing him for not making\nTarentum a state which held solid geometry in esteem.  \nBrisson (2013) takes a sceptical stance towards the evidence and\nconcludes that Archytas never solved the problem of the duplication of\nthe cube. He argues that Plato would have mentioned a solution to the\nproblem if one existed in his day and that the mathematics of the\nsolution ascribed to Archytas is impossible for someone of his time,\nsince it employs conic sections, which were not developed until the\nthird century (2013: 220–1). However, while Plato does criticize\nthe state of stereometry (solid geometry) in his day, he also affirms\nthat there are people studying it and that some of their results have\ncharm and beauty (Rep. 528c-d). There is no reason that\nArchytas’ duplication could not be included among these results.\nMoreover, the mathematics used in Archytas’ solution in no way\nrelies on conic sections but relies on mathematics found in\nEuclid’s Elements Books 1, 3, 4, 6, and 11, which rely\non geometry of the fourth century when Archytas was active (Heath\n1921, Knorr 1986, Mueller 1997 and Menn 2015 all regard the\nmathematics as appropriate for Archytas). Menaechmus, who lived two\ngenerations after Archytas, is the first person to solve the problem\nusing conic sections (see Menn 2015: 415–6). Brisson has to\ndiscount the explicit tradition that already in the fourth century\nEudemus knew of Archytas’ solution and assume that the solution\nwas developed by a compiler in the latter tradition, but it is\nimplausible that such a compiler could have developed the\nsophisticated mathematics of the solution and that, if he were such an\naccomplished mathematician, he would ascribe it to Archytas. \nOne of the most startling discoveries of early Greek science was that\nthe fundamental intervals of music, the octave, the fourth, and the\nfifth, corresponded to whole number ratios of string length. Thus, if\nwe pluck a string of length x and then a string of length\n2x, we will hear the interval of an octave between the two\nsounds. If the two string lengths are in the ratio 4 : 3, we will hear\na fourth, and, if the ratio is 3 : 2, we will hear a fifth. This\ndiscovery that the phenomena of musical sound are governed by whole\nnumber ratios must have played a central role in the Pythagorean\nconception, first expressed by Philolaus, that all things are known\nthrough number (DK 44 B4). The next step in harmonic theory was to\ndescribe an entire octave length scale in terms of mathematical\nratios. The earliest such description of a scale is found in Philolaus\nfr. B6. Philolaus recognizes that, if we go up the interval of a\nfourth from any given note, and then up the interval of a fifth, the\nfinal note will be an octave above the first note. Thus, the octave is\nmade up of a fourth and a fifth. In mathematical terms, the ratios\nthat govern the fifth (3 : 2) and fourth (4 : 3) are added by\nmultiplying the terms and thus produce an octave (3 : 2 × 4 : 3\n= 12 : 6 = 2 : 1). The interval between the note that is a fourth up\nfrom the starting note and the note that is a fifth up was regarded as\nthe basic unit of the scale, the whole tone, which corresponded to the\nratio of 9 : 8 (subtraction of ratios is carried out by dividing the\nterms, or cross multiplying: 3 : 2 / 4 : 3 = 9 : 8). The fifth was\nthus regarded as a fourth plus a whole tone, and the octave can be\nregarded as two fourths plus a whole tone. The fourth consists of two\nwhole tones with a remainder, which has the unlovely ratio of 256 :\n243 (4 : 3 / 9 : 8 = 32 : 27 / 9 : 8 = 256 : 243). Philolaus’\nscale thus consisted of the following intervals: 9 : 8, 9 : 8, 256 :\n243 [these three intervals take us up a fourth], 9 : 8, 9 : 8, 9 : 8,\n256 : 243 [these four intervals make up a fifth and complete the\noctave from our staring note]. This scale is known as the Pythagorean\ndiatonic and is the scale that Plato adopted in the construction of\nthe world soul in the Timaeus (36a-b). \nArchytas took harmonic theory to a whole new level of theoretical and\nmathematical sophistication. Ptolemy, writing in the second century\nAD, identifies Archytas as having “engaged in the study of music\nmost of all the Pythagoreans” (A16). First, Archytas provided a\ngeneral explanation of pitch, arguing that the pitch of a sound\ndepends on the speed with which the sound is propagated and travels\n(B1). Thus, if a stick is waved back and forth rapidly, it will\nproduce a sound that travels rapidly through the air, which will be\nperceived as of a higher pitch than the sound produced by a stick\nwaved more slowly. Archytas is correct to associate pitch with speed,\nbut he misunderstood the role of speed. The pitch does not depend on\nthe speed with which a sound reaches us but rather on the frequency of\nimpacts in a given period of time. A string that vibrates more rapidly\nproduces a sound of a higher pitch, but all sounds, regardless of\npitch, travel at an equal velocity, if the medium is the same.\nAlthough Archytas’ account of pitch was ultimately incorrect, it\nwas very influential. It was taken over and adapted by both Plato and\nAristotle and remained the dominant theory throughout antiquity\n(Barker 1989, 41 n. 47; Barker 2014: 187). Second, Archytas introduced\nnew mathematical rigor into Pythagorean harmonics. One of the\nimportant results of the analysis of music in terms of whole number\nratios is the recognition that it is not possible to divide the basic\nmusical intervals in half. The octave is not divided into two equal\nhalves but into a fourth and a fifth, the fourth is not divided into\ntwo equal halves but into two whole tones and a remainder. The whole\ntone cannot be divided into two equal half tones. On the other hand,\nit is possible to divide a double octave in half. Mathematically this\ncan be seen by recognizing that it is possible to insert a mean\nproportional between the terms of the ratio corresponding to the\ndouble octave (4 : 1) so that 4 : 2 :: 2 : 1. The double octave can\nthus be divided into two equal parts each having a ratio of 2 : 1. The\nratios which govern the basic musical intervals (2 : 1, 4 : 3, 3 : 2,\n9 : 8), all belong to a type of ratio known as a superparticular ratio\n– roughly speaking, ratios of the form (n + 1) :\nn. Archytas made a crucial contribution by providing a rigorous\nproof that there is no mean proportional between numbers in\nsuperparticular ratio (A19) and hence that the basic musical intervals\ncannot be divided in half. Archytas’ proof was later taken over\nand modified slightly in the Sectio Canonis ascribed to\nEuclid (Prop. 3; see Barker 1989, 195). On Archytas’ proof see\nHuffman 2005: 451–70 and Barker 2007: 303–5. \nArchytas’ final contribution to music theory has to do with the\nstructure of the scale (for a more detailed account than what follows\nsee Huffman 2005: 402–25 and Barker 2007: 292–302). The\nGreeks used a number of different scales, which were distinguished by\nthe way in which the fourth, or tetrachord, was constructed. These\nscales were grouped into three main types or genera. One genus was\ncalled the diatonic; one example of this is the Pythagorean diatonic\ndescribed above, which is built on the tetrachord with the intervals 9\n: 8, 9 : 8 and 256 : 243 and was used by Philolaus and Plato. There is\nno doubt that Archytas knew of this diatonic scale, but his own\ndiatonic tetrachord was somewhat different, being composed of the\nintervals 9 : 8, 8 : 7 and 28 : 27. Archytas also defined scales in\nthe two other major genera, the enharmonic and chromatic.\nArchytas’ enharmonic tetrachord is composed of the intervals 5 :\n4, 36 : 35 and 28 : 27 and his chromatic tetrachord of the intervals\n32 : 27, 243 : 224, and 28 : 27. There are several puzzles about the\ntetrachords which Archytas adopts in each of the genera. First, why\ndoes Archytas reject the Pythagorean diatonic used by Philolaus and\nPlato? Second, Ptolemy, who is our major source for Archytas’\ntetrachords (A16), argues that Archytas adopted as a principle that\nall concordant intervals should correspond to superparticular ratios.\nThe ratios in Archytas’ diatonic and enharmonic tetrachords are\nindeed superparticular, but two of the ratios in his chromatic\ntetrachord are not superparticular (32 : 27 and 243 : 224). Why are\nthese ratios not superparticular as well? Finally, Plato criticizes\nPythagorean harmonics in the Republic for seeking numbers in\nheard harmonies rather than ascending to generalized problems (531c).\nCan any sense be made of this criticism in light of Archytas’\ntetrachords? The basis for an answer to all of these questions is\ncontained in the work of Winnington-Ingram (1932) and Barker (1989,\n46-52). The crucial point is that Archytas’ account of the\ntetrachords in each of the three genera can be shown to correspond to\nthe musical practice of his day; Ptolemy’s criticisms miss the\nmark because of his ignorance of musical practice in Archytas’\nday, some 500 years before Ptolemy (Winnington-Ingram 1932, 207).\nArchytas is giving mathematical descriptions of scales actually in\nuse; although mathematical considerations did play a role (Barker\n2007: 295–302), he arrived at his numbers in part by observation\nof the way in which musicians tuned their instruments (Barker 1989,\n50–51). He did not follow the Pythagorean diatonic scale because\nit did not correspond to any scale actually in use, although it does\ncorrespond to a method of tuning. The unusual numbers in\nArchytas’ chromatic tetrachord do correspond to a chromatic\nscale in use in Archytas’ day. Ptolemy was wrong to suggest that\nArchytas adhered to the principle that all concordant intervals should\nhave superparticular ratios (Huffman 2005: 422–3), although\nBarker suggests that he may have been following a different but\nrelated principle (2007: 301). Archytas thus provides a brilliant\nanalysis of the music of his day, but it is precisely his focus on\nactual musical practice that draws Plato’s ire. Plato does not\nwant him to focus on the music he hears about him (“heard\nharmonies”) but rather to ascend to consider quite abstract\nquestions about which numbers are harmonious with which. Plato might\nwell have welcomed a principle of concordance based solely on\nmathematical considerations, such as the principle that only\nsuperparticular ratios are concordant, but Archytas wanted to explain\nthe numbers of the music he actually heard played. There is an\nimportant metaphysical issue at stake here. Plato is calling for the\nstudy of number in itself, apart from the sensible world, while\nArchytas, like Pythagoreans before him, envisages no split between a\nsensible and an intelligible world and is looking for the numbers\nwhich govern sensible things. For discussions of Archytas as the\ntarget of Plato’s complaints in the  Republic see\nHuffman 2005: 423–5 and Barker 2014:192–3. \nThere have been tendencies both to overvalue and to undervalue\nArchytas’ achievement as a mathematician. Van der Waerden went\nso far as to add to Archytas’ accomplishments both Book VIII of\nEuclid’s Elements and the treatise on the mathematics\nof music known as the Sectio Canonis, which is ascribed to\nEuclid in the ancient tradition (1962, 152–5). Although later\nscholars (e.g., Knorr 1975: 244) repeat these assertions, they are\nbased in part on a very subjective analysis of Archytas’ style.\nArchytas influenced the Sectio Canonis, since Proposition 3\nis based on a proof by Archytas (A19), but the treatise cannot be by\nArchytas, because its theory of pitch and its account of the diatonic\nand enharmonic tetrachords differ from those of Archytas. On the other\nhand, some scholars have cast doubt on Archytas’ prowess as a\nmathematician, arguing that some of his work looks like “mere\narithmology” and “mathematical mystification”\n(Burkert 1972a, 386; Mueller 1997, 289). This judgment rests largely\non a text (A17) that has been mistakenly interpreted as presenting\nArchytas’ own views, whereas, in fact, it presents\nArchytas’ report of his predecessors (Huffman 2005:\n428–37; Barker 2007: 193–5). The duplication of the cube\nand Archytas’ contributions to the mathematics of music (Barker\n2007: 287 calls him “a heroic figure in the early history of\nmathematical harmonics”) show that there can be no doubt that he\nwas one of the leading mathematicians of the first part of the fourth\ncentury BC. This was certainly the judgment of antiquity. In his\nhistory of geometry, Eudemus identified Archytas along with Leodamas\nand Theaetetus as the three most prominent mathematicians of\nPlato’s generation (A6 = Proclus, in Eucl., prol. II\n66, 14). Netz (2014) has recently argued that there were two networks\nthat accounted for most of the progress in ancient Greek mathematics.\nThe later used Archimedes as the paradigmatic figure, while the\nearlier used Archytas. Netz suggests that we should apply Bertrand\nRussell’s description of Pythagoras as “one of the most\nimportant men that ever lived” to Archytas instead both because\nof his mathematical genius and also because of his pivotal position in\nthree different groups: (1) South Italian Pythagoreans, (2) Greek\nmathematicians, and (3) philosophers whose work was in dialogue with\nPlato (2014: 181–2).  \nArchytas B1 is the beginning of his book on harmonics, and most of it\nis devoted to the basic principles of his theory of acoustics and, in\nparticular, to his theory of pitch described in section 2.2 above. In\nthe first five lines, however, Archytas provides a proem on the value\nof the sciences (mathêmata) in general. There are\nseveral important features of this proem. First, Archytas identifies a\nset of four sciences: astronomy, geometry, “logistic”\n(arithmetic) and music. B1 is thus probably the earliest text to\nidentify the set of sciences that became known as the\nquadrivium in the middle ages and that constitute four of the\nseven liberal arts. Second, Archytas does not present this\nclassification of sciences as his own discovery but instead begins\nwith praise of his predecessors who have worked in these fields. Some\nscholars argue that, when he praises “those concerned with the\nsciences,” he is thinking only of the Pythagoreans (e.g., Zhmud\n1997, 198 and Lasserre 1954, 36), but this is wrongly to assume that\nall early Greek mathematics is Pythagorean. Archytas gives no hint\nthat he is limiting his remarks to Pythagoreans, and, in areas where\nwe can identify those who influenced him most, these figures are not\nlimited to Pythagoreans (e.g., Hippocrates of Chios in geometry, see\nsection 2.1). He praises his predecessors in the sciences, because,\n“having discerned well about the nature of wholes, they were\nlikely also to see well how things are in their parts” and to\n“have correct understanding about individual things as they\nare.” It is here that Archytas is putting forth his own\nunderstanding of the nature and value of the sciences; because of the\nbrevity of the passage, much remains unclear. Archytas appears to be\npraising those concerned with the sciences for their discernment,\ntheir ability to make distinctions (diagignôskein). He\nargues that they begin by distinguishing the nature of wholes, the\nuniversal concepts of a science, and, because they do this well, they\nare able to understand particular objects (the parts). Archytas\nappears to follow exactly this procedure in his Harmonics. He\nbegins by defining the most universal concept of the science, sound,\nand explains it in terms of other concepts such as impact, before\ngoing on to distinguish between audible and inaudible sounds and\nsounds of high and low pitch. The goal of the science is not the\nmaking of these distinctions concerning universal concepts, however,\nbut knowledge of the true nature of individual things. Thus,\nArchytas’ harmonics ends with the mathematical description of\nthe musical intervals that we hear practicing musicians use (see\nsection 2.2 above). Astronomy will end with a mathematical description\nof the periods, risings and settings of the planets. One way to\nunderstand Archytas’ project is to see him as working out the\nprogram suggested by his predecessor in the Pythagorean tradition,\nPhilolaus. One of Philolaus’ central theses was that we only\ngain knowledge of things insofar as we can give an account of them in\nterms of numbers (DK 44 B4). While Philolaus only took the first steps\nin this project, Archytas is much more successful in giving an account\nof individual things in the phenomenal world in terms of numbers, as\nhis description of the musical intervals shows. \nPlato’s account of the sciences in Book VII of the\nRepublic can be seen as a response to Archytas’ view of\nthe sciences. First Plato identifies a group of five rather than four\nsciences and decries the neglect of his proposed fifth science,\nstereometry (solid geometry), with a probable allusion to Archytas\n(see section 2.1). Plato quotes with approval Archytas’\nassertion that “these sciences seem to be akin” (B1),\nalthough he applies it just to harmonics and astronomy rather than to\nArchytas’ quadrivium and does not mention him by name.\nIn the same passage, however, Plato pointedly rejects the Pythagorean\nattempt to search for numbers in “heard harmonies.” In\ndoing so Plato is disagreeing with Archytas’ attempt to\ndetermine the numbers that govern things in the sensible world. For\nPlato, the value of the sciences is their ability to turn the eye of\nthe soul from the sensible to the intelligible realm. Book VII of the\nRepublic with its elaborate argument for the distinction\nbetween the intelligible and sensible realm, between the cave and the\nintelligible world outside the cave, may be in large part directed at\nArchytas’ attempt to use mathematics to explain the sensible\nworld. As Aristotle repeatedly emphasizes, the Pythagoreans differed\nfrom Plato precisely in their refusal to separate numbers from things\n(e.g., Metaph. 987b27). \nIn B4, Archytas asserts that “logistic seems to be far superior\nindeed to the other arts in regard to wisdom.” What does\nArchytas mean by “logistic”? It appears to be\nArchytas’ term for the science of number, which was mentioned as\none of the four sister sciences in B1. There is simply not enough\ncontext in B4 or other texts of Archytas to determine the meaning of\nlogistic from Archytas’ usage alone. It is necessary to rely to\nsome extent on Plato, who is the only other early figure to use the\nterm extensively. A later conception of logistic, as something that\ndeals with numbered things rather than numbers themselves, which is\nfound in, e.g., Geminus, should not be ascribed to Plato or Archytas\n(Klein 1968; Burkert 1972a, 447 n. 119). In Plato,\n“logistic” can refer to everyday calculation, what we\nwould call arithmetic (e.g. 3 × 700 = 2,100; see, Hp.\nMi. 366c). In other passages, however, Plato defines logistic in\nparallel with arithmêtikê, and treats the two of\nthem as together constituting the science of number, on which\npractical manipulation of number is based (Klein 1968, 23–24).\nBoth arithmêtikê and logistic deal with the even\nand the odd. Arithmêtikê focuses not on\nquantities but on kinds of numbers (Grg. 451b), beginning\nwith the even and the odd and presumably continuing with the types we\nfind later in Nicomachus (Ar. 1.8 – 1.13), such as\nprime, composite and even-times even. Logistic, on the other hand,\nfocuses on quantity, the “amount the odd and even have both in\nthemselves and in respect to one another” (Grg. 451c).\nAn example of one part of logistic might be the study of various sorts\nof means and proportions, which focus on the quantitative relations of\nnumbers to one another (e.g., Nicomachus, Ar. II. 21 ff.). In\nB2, Archytas would probably consider himself to be doing logistic,\nwhen he defines the three types of means which are relevant to music\n(geometric, arithmetic, and harmonic). The geometric mean arises\nwhenever three terms are so related that, as the first is to the\nsecond, so the second is to the third (e.g., 8 : 4 :: 4 : 2) and the\narithmetic, when three terms are so related that the first exceeds the\nsecond by the same amount as the second exceeds the third (e.g., 6 : 4\n:: 4 : 2). Archytas, like Plato (R. 525c), uses logistic not\njust in this narrow sense of the study of relative quantity, but also\nto designate the entire science of numbers including\narithmêtikê. \nWhy does Archytas think that logistic is superior to the other\nsciences? In B4, he particularly compares it to geometry, arguing that\nlogistic (1) “deals with what it wishes more vividly than\ngeometry” and (2) “completes demonstrations” where\ngeometry cannot, even “if there is any investigation concerning\nshapes.” This last remark is surprising, since the study of\nshapes would appear to be the proper domain of geometry. The most\ncommon way of explaining Archytas’ remark is to suppose that he\nis arguing that logistic is mathematically superior to geometry, in\nthat certain proofs can only be completed by an appeal to logistic.\nBurkert sees this as a reason for doubting the authenticity of the\nfragment, since the exact opposite seems to be true. Archytas could\ndetermine the cube root of two geometrically, through his solution to\nthe duplication of the cube, but could not do so arithmetically, since\nthe cube root of two is an irrational number (1972a, 220 n. 14). Other\nscholars have pointed out, however, that certain proofs in geometry do\nrequire an appeal to logistic (Knorr 1975, 311; Mueller 1992b, 90 n.\n12), e.g., logistic is required to recognize the incomensurability of\nthe diagonal with the side of the square, since incommensurability\narises when two magnitudes “have not to one another the ratio\nwhich number has to number” (Euclid X 7). These\nsuggestions show that logistic can be superior to geometry in certain\ncases, but they do not explain Archytas’ more general assertion\nthat logistic deals with whatever problems it wants more clearly than\ngeometry. \nHowever, it may be that B4 is not in fact comparing logistic to the\nother sciences as sciences – in terms of their relative success\nin providing demonstrations. The title of the work from which B4 is\nsaid to come, Discourses (Diatribai), is most\ncommonly used of ethical treatises. Moreover, it is specifically with\nregard to wisdom (sophia) that logistic is said to be\nsuperior, and, while sophia can refer to technical expertise,\nit more commonly refers to the highest sort of intellectual\nexcellence, often the excellence that allows us to live a good life\n(Arist., EN 1141a12; Pl., R. 428d ff.). Is there any\nsense in which logistic makes us wiser than the other sciences? Since\nArchytas evidently agreed with Philolaus that we only understand\nindividual things in the world insofar as we grasp the numbers that\ngovern them, it seems quite plausible that Archytas would regard\nlogistic as the science that makes us wise about the world. It is in\nthis sense that logistic will always be superior to geometry, even\nwhen dealing with shapes. Perhaps the most famous statue of the\nclassical period is the Doryphoros by the Argive sculptor Polyclitus,\nwhich he also referred to as the Canon (i.e., the standard). Although\nPolyclitus undoubtedly made use of geometry in constructing this\nmagnificent shape, in a famous sentence from his book, also entitled\nCanon, he asserts that his statue came to be not through many\nshapes but “through many numbers” (DK40 B2, see\nHuffman 2002a). Geometrical relations alone will not determine the\nform of a given object, we have to assign specific proportions,\nspecific numbers. Archytas also thought that numbers and logistic were\nthe basis of the just state and hence the good life. In B3 he argues\nthat it is rational calculation (logismos) that produces the\nfairness on which the state depends. Justice is a relation that needs\nto be stated numerically and it is through such a statement that rich\nand poor can live together, each seeing that he has what is fair.\nLogistic will always be superior to the other sciences, because those\nsciences will in the end rely on numbers to give us knowledge of the\nsounds we hear, the shapes we see and the movements of the heavenly\nbodies which we observe. \nAristotle is the first Greek author to mention the sciences of optics\nand mechanics, describing optics as a subordinate science to geometry\nand mechanics as a subordinate science to solid geometry\n(APo. 78b34). Archytas does not mention either of these\nsciences in B1, when describing the work of his predecessors in the\nsciences, nor does Plato mention them. This silence suggests that the\ntwo disciplines may have first developed in the first half of the\nfourth century, when Archytas was most active, and it is possible that\nhe played an important role in the development of both of them. In a\nrecently identified fragment from his book on the Pythagoreans\n(Iamblichus, Comm. Math. XXV; see Burkert 1972a, 50 n. 112),\nAristotle assigns a hitherto unrecognized importance to optics in\nPythagoreanism. Just as the Pythagoreans were impressed with the fact\nthat musical intervals were based on whole number ratios, so they were\nimpressed that the phenomena of optics could be explained in terms of\ngeometrical diagrams. In addition to being an accomplished\nmathematician, Archytas had a theory of vision and evidently tried to\nexplain some of the phenomena involved in mirrors. In contrast to\nPlato, who argued that the visual ray, which proceeded from the eye,\nrequires the support of and coalesces with external light, Archytas\nexplained vision in terms of the visual ray alone (A25). It is\ntempting, then, to suppose that Archytas played a major role in the\ndevelopment of the mathematically based Pythagorean optics, to which\nAristotle refers. On the other hand, when Aristotle refers to\nPythagoreans, he generally means Pythagoreans of the fifth century.\nElsewhere he treats Archytas independently of the Pythagorean\ntradition, writing works on Archytas which were distinct from his work\non the Pythagoreans. It would thus be more natural to read\nAristotle’s reference to Pythagorean optics as alluding to\nfifth-century Pythagoreans such as Philolaus. Archytas will then have\nbeen responsible for developing an already existing Pythagorean\noptical tradition into a science, rather than founding such a\ntradition. \nDiogenes Laertius reports that Archytas was “the first to\nsystematize mechanics by using mathematical first principles”\n(VIII 83 = A1), and Archytas is accordingly sometimes hailed by modern\nscholars as the founder of the science of mechanics. There is a\npuzzle, however, since, no ancient Greek author in the later\nmechanical tradition (e.g., Heron, Pappus, Archimedes, Philon) ever\nascribes any work in the field to Archytas. What did the ancients mean\nby mechanics? A rough definition would be “the description and\nexplanation of the operation of machines” (Knorr 1996). The\nearliest treatise in mechanics, the Mechanical Problems\nascribed to Aristotle, begins with problems having to do with a simple\nmachine, the lever. Pappus (AD 320) refers to machines used to lift\ngreat weights, machines of war such as the catapult, water lifting\nmachines, amazing devices (automata), and machines that served as\nmodels of the heavens (1024.12 – 1025.4, on Pappus, see Cuomo\n2000). Pappus emphasizes, however, that, in addition to this practical\npart of mechanics, there is a theoretical part that is heavily\nmathematical (1022. 13–15). Given his interest in describing\nphysical phenomena in mathematical terms, it might seem logical that\nArchytas would make important contributions to mechanics. The actual\nevidence is less conclusive. A great part of the tendency to assign\nArchytas a role in the development of mechanics can be traced to\nPlutarch’s story about the quarrel between Plato and Archytas\nover Archytas’ supposed mechanical solution to the problem of\ndoubling the cube. This story is likely to be false (see 2.1 above).\nSome scholars have argued that Archytas devised machines of war (Diels\n1965; Cambiano 1998), as Archimedes did later, but this conclusion is\nbased on questionable inferences and no ancient source ascribes such\nmachines to Archytas. The only mechanical device that can with some\nprobability be assigned to Archytas, apart from the children’s\ntoy known as a “clapper” (A10), is an automaton in the\nform of a wooden dove, which was connected to a pulley and\ncounterweight and “flew” up from a lower perch to a higher\none, when set in motion by a puff of air (A10a). Kingsley is deeply\ncritical of scholars who see these inventions as toys and suggests\nconnections to earlier Chinese inventors who produced a wooden bird\nthat could fly for military purposes (2014: 155–9). Others have\nsuggested that, since ancient siege devices were called by the names\nof animals (e.g., “tortoise” and “crow”),\nArchytas’ “dove” might have been an early catapult\nof his devising, or a projectile hurled by such a catapult, which was\nlater misunderstood to be a mechanical dove (Berryman 2003: 355; 2009:\n78). However, no ancient source explains the dove in this way. A\ncomplicating factor here is that Diogenes Laertius reports (A1) that\nthere was a book on mechanics in circulation, which some thought to be\nby a different Archytas, so that it is possible that the flying dove\nis, in fact, the work of a separate Archytas. Archytas’ solution\nto the duplication of the cube, although it was not mechanical itself,\nwas of enormous importance for mechanics, since the solution to the\nproblem allows one not just to double a cube but also to construct\nbodies that are larger or smaller than a given body in any given\nratio. Thus, the solution permits the construction of a full-scale\nmachine on the basis of a working model. Pappus cites the solution to\nthe duplication of the cube as one of the three most crucial\ngeometrical theorems for practical mechanics (Math. Coll.\n1028. 18–21). It may then be that Archytas’ primary\ncontribution to mechanics was precisely his solution to the\nduplication of the cube and that it is this solution which constituted\nthe mathematical first principles which Archytas provided for\nmechanics. For a recent discussion of these issues seen Berryman 2009:\n87–97. It is more doubtful that Archytas wrote a treatise on\nmechanics. Schofield has recently argued that the evidence for\nArchytas’ work both in optics and in mechanics is so meagre that\nwe should “be skeptical about Archytas’ alleged\nrole” (2014: 86). \nIn the Metaphysics, Aristotle praises Archytas for having\noffered definitions which took account of both form and matter\n(1043a14–26 = A22). The examples given are\n“windlessness” (nênemia), which is defined\nas “stillness [the form] in a quantity of air [the\nmatter],” and “calm-on-the-ocean”\n(galênê), which is defined as “levelness\n[the form] of sea [the matter].” The terms form and matter are\nAristotle’s, and we cannot be sure how Archytas conceptualized\nthe two parts of his definitions. A plausible suggestion is that he\nfollowed his predecessor Philolaus in adopting limiters and unlimiteds\nas his basic metaphysical principles and that he saw his definitions\nas combinations of limiters, such as levelness and stillness, with\nunlimiteds, such as air and sea. The oddity of\n“windlessness” and “calm-on-the-sea” as\nexamples suggests that they were not the by-products of some other\nsort of investigation, e.g. cosmology, but were chosen precisely to\nillustrate principles of definition. Archytas may thus have devoted a\ntreatise to the topic. Aristotle elsewhere comments on the use of\nproportion in developing definitions and uses these same examples\n(Top. 108a7). The ability to recognize likeness in things of\ndifferent genera is said to be the key. “Windlessness” and\n“calm-on-the-ocean” are recognized as alike, and this\nlikeness can be expressed in the following proportion: as\nnênemia is to the air so galênê is\nto the sea. It is tempting to suppose that Archytas, who saw the world\nas explicable in terms of number and proportion, also saw proportion\nas the key in developing definitions. This would explain another\nreference to Archytas in Aristotle. At Rhetoric\n1412a9–17 (= A12) Aristotle praises Archytas precisely for his\nability to see similarity, even in things which differ greatly, and\ngives as an example Archytas’ assertion that an arbitrator and\nan altar are the same. DK oddly include this text among the testimonia\nfor Archytas’ life, but it clearly is part of Archytas’\nwork on definition. The definitions of both an altar and an arbitrator\nwill appeal to their common functions as a refuge, while recognizing\nthe different context and way in which this function is carried out.\nFor doubts about this reconstruction of Archytas’ theory of\ndefinition, see Barker 2006, 314–318 and Schofield 2014, 80. \nWe have very little evidence for Archytas’ cosmology, yet he was\nresponsible for one of the most famous cosmological arguments in\nantiquity, an argument which has been hailed as “the most\ncompelling argument ever produced for the infinity of space”\n(Sorabji 1988, 125). The argument is ascribed to Archytas in a\nfragment of Eudemus preserved by Simplicius (= A24), and it is\nprobably to Archytas that Aristotle is referring when he describes the\nfifth and “most important” reason that people believe in\nthe existence of the unlimited (Ph. 203b22 ff.). Archytas\nasks anyone who argues that the universe is limited to engage in a\nthought experiment (this is one of the first recorded thought\nexperiments in antiquity): “If I arrived at the outermost edge\nof the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or\nnot? It would be paradoxical [given our normal assumptions about the\nnature of space] not to be able to extend it.” The end of the\nstaff, once extended will mark a new limit. Archytas can advance to\nthe new limit and ask the same question again, so that there will\nalways be something, into which his staff can be extended, beyond the\nsupposed limit, and hence that something is clearly unlimited. Neither\nPlato nor Aristotle accepted this argument, and both believed that the\nuniverse was limited. Nonetheless, Archytas’ argument had great\ninfluence and was taken over and adapted by the Stoics, Epicureans\n(Lucretius I 968–983), Locke and Newton, among others, while\neliciting responses from Alexander and Simplicius (Sorabji 1988,\n125–141). For a discussion of the relation between\nArchytas’ thought experiment and other thought experiments in\nantiquity see Ierodiakonou 2011. Not all scholars have been impressed\nby the argument (see Barnes 1982, 362), and modern notions of space\nallow for it to be finite without having an edge, and without an edge\nArchytas’ argument cannot get started (but see Sorabji 1988,\n160–163). Beyond this argument, there is only exiguous evidence\nfor Archytas’ system of the physical world. Eudemus praises\nArchytas for recognizing that the unequal and uneven are not identical\nwith motion as Plato supposed (see Ti. 52e and 57e) but\nrather the causes of motion (A23). Another testimonium suggests that\nArchytas thought that all things are moved in accordance with\nproportion (Arist., Prob. 915a25–32 = A23a). The same\ntestimonium indicates that different sorts of proportion defined\ndifferent sorts of motion. Archytas asserted that “the\nproportion of equality” (arithmetic proportion?) defined natural\nmotion, which he regarded as curved motion (for a different account of\nthe proportion of equality see De Groot 2014: 195–207). This\nexplanation of natural motion is supposed to explain why certain parts\nof plants and animals (e.g. the stem, thighs, arms and trunk) are\nrounded rather than triangular or polygonal. Some scholars argue that\nit was the influence of Archytas that led Plato and Eudemus to\nemphasize uniform circular movement in explaining the heavens (Zhmud\n2006: 97). An explanation of motion in terms of proportion fits well\nwith the rest of evidence for Archytas, but the details remain\nobscure. \nArchytas’ search for the numbers in things was not limited to\nthe natural world. Political relationships and the moral action of\nindividuals were also explained in terms of number and proportion. In\nFr. 3, rational calculation is identified as the basis of the stable\nstate: \nOnce calculation (logismos) was discovered, it stopped\ndiscord and increased concord. For people do not want more than their\nshare, and equality exists, once this has come into being. For by\nmeans of calculation we will seek reconciliation in our dealings with\nothers. Through this, then, the poor receive from the powerful, and\nthe wealthy give to the needy, both in the confidence that they will\nhave what is fair on account of this. \nThis glorification of calculation is reminiscent of Plato’s\npraise for “geometrical equality” in the Gorgias\n(507e6–508a8) and Plato may be thinking of Archytas Fr. 3\n(Palmer 2014: 205–6; Huffman 2013: 259–61). The emphasis\non equality (isotas) and fairness (to ison) suggests\nthat Archytas envisages rational calculation (logismos) as\nheavily mathematical. On the other hand, logismos is not\nidentical to the technical science of number (logistic – see 3.2\nabove) but is rather a practical ability to understand numerical\ncalculations, including basic proportions, an ability that is shared\nby most human beings. It is the clarity of calculation and proportion\nthat does away with the constant striving for more\n(pleonexia), which produces discord in the state. Since the\nstate is based on a widely shared human ability to calculate, an\nability that the rich and poor share, Archytas was led to support a\nmore democratic constitution (see 1.3 above) than Plato, who\nemphasizes the expert mathematical knowledge of a few (R.\n546a ff.). Zhmud (2006: 60–76) points out connections between B3\nand Isocrates and argues that Isocrates is referring to Archytas, when\nhe says that some praise the sciences for their utility and others try\nto demonstrate that they contribute greatly to virtue\n(Busiris 23). However, Archytas seems to accept both of these\nviews about the sciences, while Isocrates refers to two different\ngroups of people. Isocrates’ reference is also very general and\nmakes no allusion to the central terms of B3 so that it is doubtful\nthat he has Archytas in mind. For further discussion of the argument\nof B3 see Huffman 2005: 182–224 and Schofield 2008.  \nMost of our evidence for Archytas’ ethical views is,\nunfortunately, not based on fragments of his writings but rather on\nanecdotes, which probably ultimately derive from Aristoxenus’\nLife of Archytas. The good life of the individual, no less\nthan the stability of the state, appears to have been founded on\nrational calculation. Aristoxenus presented a confrontation between\nthe Syracusan hedonist, Polyarchus, and Archytas. Polyarchus’\nlong speech is preserved by Athenaeus and Archytas’ response by\nCicero (A9 = Deip. 545a and Sen. XII 39–41\nrespectively). Schofield (2014: 70, n.2) raises doubts about whether\nCicero really preserves Archytas’ response (See Huffman 2005:\n323–37). Horky (2011: 120) assumes without argument that\nAristoxenus presented Archytas as delivering his speech in the\npresence of Plato and the Samnite C. Pontius, but this is part of\nCicero’s frame story and there is no evidence that it derives\nfrom Aristoxenus. Polyarchus’ defense of always striving for\nmore (pleonexia) and of the pursuit of pleasure is\nreminiscent of Plato’s presentations of Callicles and\nThrasymachus, but is not derived from those presentations and is\nbetter seen as an important parallel development (Huffman 2002b).\nArchytas bases his response on the premise that reason (= rational\ncalculation) is the best part of us and the part that should govern\nour actions. Polyarchus might grant such a premise, since his is a\nrational hedonism. Archytas responds once again with a thought\nexperiment. We are to imagine someone in the throes of the greatest\npossible bodily pleasure (sexual orgasm?). Surely we must agree that a\nperson in such a state is not able to engage in rational calculation.\nIt thus appears that bodily pleasure is in itself antithetical to\nreason and that, the more we succeed in obtaining it, the less we are\nable to reason. Aristotle appears to refer to this argument in the\nNicomachean Ethics (1152b16–18). Archytas’\nargument is specifically directed against bodily pleasure and he did\nnot think that all pleasure was disruptive; he enjoyed playing with\nchildren (A8) and recognized that the pleasures of friendship were\npart of a good life (Cicero, Amic. XXIII 88). Other anecdotes\nemphasize that our actions must be governed by reason rather than the\nemotions: Archytas refused to punish the serious misdeeds of his\nslaves, because he had become angry and did not want to act out of\nanger (A7); he restrained himself from swearing aloud by writing his\ncurses on a wall instead (A11). Palmer argues that Archytas was\nworking with a Pythagorean conception of the soul as divided into two\nparts: the intellect and a part responsible for the affective states\nsuch as emotions and appetites (2014: 209).  \nArchytas fits the common stereotype of a Pythagorean better than\nanyone else does. He is by far the most accomplished Pythagorean\nmathematician, making important contributions to geometry,\nlogistic/arithmetic and harmonics. He was more successful as a\npolitical leader than any other ancient philosopher, and there is a\nrich anecdotal tradition about his personal self-control. It is\nstriking, however, that there are essentially no testimonia connecting\nArchytas to metempsychosis or the religious aspect of Pythagoreanism.\nArchytas is a prominent figure in the rebirth of interest in\nPythagoreanism in first century BC Rome: Horace, Propertius and Cicero\nall highlight him. As the last prominent member of the early\nPythagorean tradition, more pseudo-Pythagorean works came to be forged\nin his name than any other Pythagorean, including Pythagoras himself.\nHis name, with the spelling Architas, continued to exert power in\nMedieval and Renaissance texts, although the accomplishments assigned\nto him in those texts are fanciful. \nScholars have typically emphasized the continuities between Plato and\nArchytas (e.g., Kahn 2001, 56), but the evidence suggests that\nArchytas and Plato were in serious disagreement on a number of issues.\nPlato’s only certain reference to Archytas is part of a\ncriticism of his approach to harmonics in Book VII of the\nRepublic, where there is probably also a criticism of his\nwork in solid geometry. Plato’s attempt to argue for the split\nbetween the intelligible and sensible world in Books VI and VII of the\nRepublic may well be a protreptic directed at Archytas, who\nrefused to separate numbers from things. It is sometimes thought that\nthe eponymous primary speaker in Plato’s Timaeus, who\nis described as a leading political figure and philosopher from\nsouthern Italy (20a), must be a stand-in for Archytas. The\nTimaeus, however, is a most un-Archytan document (Huffman\n2013: 263-8). It is based on the split between the sensible and\nintelligible world, which Archytas did not accept. Plato argues that\nthe universe is limited, while Archytas is famous for this argument to\nshow that it is unlimited. Plato constructs the world soul according\nto ratios that are important in harmonic theory, but he uses\nPhilolaus’ ratios rather than Archytas’. Plato does adopt\nArchytas’ theory of pitch with some modification, but Archytas\nand Plato disagree on the explanation of sight. For a different view\nof the relation between Plato and Archytas see Kingsley 2014:\n156–7. Archytas’ refusal to split the intelligible from\nthe sensible may have made him a more attractive figure to Aristotle,\nwho devoted four books to him (Huffman 2005: 583–594) and\npraised his definitions for treating the composite of matter and form,\nnot of form separate from matter (Metaph. 1043a14–26).\nArchytas’ vision of the role of mathematics in the state is\ncloser to Aristotle’s mathematical account of distributive and\nredistributive justice (EN 1130b30 ff.) than to Plato’s\nemphasis on the expert mathematical knowledge of the guardians.\nClearly Archytas was an important influence on both Plato and\nAristotle, but the exact nature of those philosophical relationships\nis complex.","contact.mail":"cahuff@depauw.edu","contact.domain":"depauw.edu"}]
