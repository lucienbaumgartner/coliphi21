This entry\ncovers: (1) the challenge of environmental ethics to the\nanthropocentrism (i.e., human-centeredness) embedded in traditional\nwestern ethical thinking; (2) the early development of the discipline\nin the 1960s and 1970s; (3) the connection of deep ecology, feminist\nenvironmental ethics, animism and social ecology to politics; (4) the\nattempt to apply traditional ethical theories, including\nconsequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, to support\ncontemporary environmental concerns; (5) the preservation of\nbiodiversity as an ethical goal; (6) the broader concerns of some\nthinkers with wilderness, the built environment and the politics of\npoverty; (7) the ethics of sustainability and climate change, and (8)\nsome directions for possible future developments of the\ndiscipline. \n\n\nSuppose putting out natural fires, culling feral animals or\ndestroying some individual members of overpopulated indigenous species\nis necessary for the protection of the integrity of a certain\necosystem. Will these actions be morally permissible or even required?\nIs it morally acceptable for farmers in non-industrial countries to\npractise slash and burn techniques to clear areas for agriculture?\nConsider a mining company which has performed open pit mining in some\npreviously unspoiled area. Does the company have a moral obligation to\nrestore the landform and surface ecology? And what is the value of a\nhumanly restored environment compared with the originally natural\nenvironment? It is often said to be morally wrong for human beings to\npollute and destroy parts of the natural environment and to consume a\nhuge proportion of the planet’s natural resources. If that is wrong,\nis it simply because a sustainable environment is essential to\n(present and future) human well-being? Or is such behaviour also wrong\nbecause the natural environment and/or its various contents have\ncertain values in their own right so that these values ought to be\nrespected and protected in any case? These are among the questions\ninvestigated by environmental ethics. Some of them are specific\nquestions faced by individuals in particular circumstances, while\nothers are more global questions faced by groups and communities. Yet\nothers are more abstract questions concerning the value and moral\nstanding of the natural environment and its non-human components. \nIn the literature on environmental ethics the distinction between\ninstrumental value and\n intrinsic value\n(in the sense of “non-instrumental value”) has been of\nconsiderable importance. The former is the value of things as\nmeans to further some other ends, whereas the latter is the\nvalue of things as ends in themselves regardless of whether\nthey are also useful as means to other ends. For instance, certain\nfruits have instrumental value for bats who feed on them, since\nfeeding on the fruits is a means to survival for the bats. However, it\nis not widely agreed that fruits have value as ends in themselves. We\ncan likewise think of a person who teaches others as having\ninstrumental value for those who want to acquire knowledge. Yet, in\naddition to any such value, it is normally said that a person, as a\nperson, has intrinsic value, i.e., value in his or her own right\nindependently of his or her prospects for serving the ends of\nothers. For another example, a certain wild plant may have\ninstrumental value because it provides the ingredients for some\nmedicine or as an aesthetic object for human observers. But if the\nplant also has some value in itself independently of its prospects for\nfurthering some other ends such as human health, or the pleasure from\naesthetic experience, then the plant also has intrinsic value. Because\nthe intrinsically valuable is that which is good as an end in itself,\nit is commonly agreed that something’s possession of intrinsic value\ngenerates a prima facie direct moral duty on the part of moral agents\nto protect it or at least refrain from damaging it (see O’Neil 1992\nand Jamieson 2002 for detailed accounts of intrinsic value). \nMany traditional western ethical perspectives, however, are\nanthropocentric or human-centered in that either they assign\nintrinsic value to human beings alone (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a strong sense) or they assign a\nsignificantly greater amount of intrinsic value to human beings than\nto any non-human things such that the protection or promotion of human\ninterests or well-being at the expense of non-human things turns out\nto be nearly always justified (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a weak sense). For example, Aristotle\n(Politics, Bk. 1, Ch. 8) maintains that “nature has\nmade all things specifically for the sake of man” and that the\nvalue of non-human things in nature is merely instrumental. Generally,\nanthropocentric positions find it problematic to articulate what is\nwrong with the cruel treatment of non-human animals, except to the\nextent that such treatment may lead to bad consequences for human\nbeings. Immanuel Kant (“Duties to Animals and Spirits”, in\nLectures on Ethics), for instance, suggests that cruelty\ntowards a dog might encourage a person to develop a character which\nwould be desensitized to cruelty towards humans. From this standpoint,\ncruelty towards non-human animals would be instrumentally, rather than\nintrinsically, wrong. Likewise, anthropocentrism often recognizes some\nnon-intrinsic wrongness of anthropogenic (i.e. human-caused)\nenvironmental devastation. Such destruction might damage the\nwell-being of human beings now and in the future, since our well-being\nis essentially dependent on a sustainable environment (see Passmore\n1974; Bookchin 1990; Norton et al. (eds.) 1995). \nWhen environmental ethics emerged as a new sub-discipline of\nphilosophy in the early 1970s, it did so by posing a challenge to\ntraditional anthropocentrism. In the first place, it questioned the\nassumed moral superiority of human beings to members of other species\non Earth. In the second place, it investigated the possibility of\nrational arguments for assigning intrinsic value to the natural\nenvironment and its non-human contents. It should be noted, however,\nthat some theorists working in the field see no need to develop new,\nnon-anthropocentric theories. Instead, they advocate what may be\ncalled enlightened anthropocentrism (or, perhaps more\nappropriately called, prudential anthropocentrism). Briefly,\nthis is the view that all the moral duties we have towards the\nenvironment are derived from our direct duties to its human\ninhabitants. The practical purpose of environmental ethics, they\nmaintain, is to provide moral grounds for social policies aimed at\nprotecting the Earth’s environment and remedying environmental\ndegradation. Enlightened anthropocentrism, they argue, is sufficient\nfor that practical purpose, and perhaps even more effective in\ndelivering pragmatic outcomes, in terms of policy-making, than\nnon-anthropocentric theories given the theoretical burden on the\nlatter to provide sound arguments for its more radical view that the\nnon-human environment has intrinsic value (cf. Norton 1991, de Shalit\n1994, Light and Katz 1996). Furthermore, some prudential\nanthropocentrists may hold what might be called cynical\nanthropocentrism, which says that we have a higher-level\nanthropocentric reason to be non-anthropocentric in our day-to-day\nthinking. Suppose that a day-to-day non-anthropocentrist tends to act\nmore benignly towards the non-human environment on which human\nwell-being depends. This would provide reason for encouraging\nnon-anthropocentric thinking, even to those who find the idea of\nnon-anthropocentric intrinsic value hard to swallow. In order for such\na strategy to be effective one may need to hide one’s cynical\nanthropocentrism from others and even from oneself. The position can\nbe structurally compared to some indirect form of\n consequentialism\n and may attract parallel critiques (see\n Henry Sidgwick\non utilitarianism and esoteric morality, and\n Bernard Williams\n on indirect utilitarianism). \nAlthough nature was the focus of much nineteenth and twentieth century\nphilosophy, contemporary environmental ethics only emerged as an\nacademic discipline in the 1970s. The questioning and rethinking of\nthe relationship of human beings with the natural environment over the\nlast thirty years reflected an already widespread perception in the\n1960s that the late twentieth century faced a human population\nexplosion as well as a serious environmental crisis. Among the\naccessible work that drew attention to a sense of crisis was Rachel\nCarson’s Silent Spring (1963), which consisted of a number of\nessays earlier published in the New Yorker magazine detailing\nhow pesticides such as DDT, aldrin and deildrin concentrated through\nthe food web. Commercial farming practices aimed at maximizing crop\nyields and profits, Carson speculates, are capable of impacting\nsimultaneously on environmental and public health. \nIn a much cited essay (White 1967) on the historical roots of the\nenvironmental crisis, historian Lynn White argued that the main\nstrands of Judeo-Christian thinking had encouraged the\noverexploitation of nature by maintaining the superiority of humans\nover all other forms of life on Earth, and by depicting all of nature\nas created for the use of humans. White’s thesis was widely discussed\nin theology, history, and has been subject to some sociological\ntesting as well as being regularly discussed by philosophers (see\nWhitney 1993, Attfield 2001). Central to the rationale for his thesis\nwere the works of the Church Fathers and The Bible itself, supporting\nthe anthropocentric perspective that humans are the only things that\nmatter on Earth. Consequently, they may utilize and consume everything\nelse to their advantage without any injustice. For example,\nGenesis 1: 27–8 states: “God created man in his own\nimage, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he\nthem. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion\nover fish of the sea, and over fowl of the air, and over every living\nthing that moveth upon the earth.” Likewise, Thomas Aquinas\n(Summa Contra Gentiles, Bk. 3, Pt 2, Ch 112) argued that\nnon-human animals are “ordered to man’s use”. According to\nWhite, the Judeo-Christian idea that humans are created in the image\nof the transcendent supernatural God, who is radically separate from\nnature, also by extension radically separates humans themselves from\nnature. This ideology further opened the way for untrammeled\nexploitation of nature. Modern Western science itself, White argued,\nwas “cast in the matrix of Christian theology” so that it\ntoo inherited the “orthodox Christian arrogance toward\nnature” (White 1967: 1207). Clearly, without technology and\nscience, the environmental extremes to which we are now exposed would\nprobably not be realized. The point of White’s thesis, however, is\nthat given the modern form of science and technology,\nJudeo-Christianity itself provides the original deep-seated drive to\nunlimited exploitation of nature. Nevertheless, White argued that some\nminority traditions within Christianity (e.g., the views of\nSt. Francis) might provide an antidote to the “arrogance”\nof a mainstream tradition steeped in anthropocentrism. \nAround the same time, the Stanford ecologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich\nwarned in The Population Bomb (Ehrlich 1968) that the growth\nof human population threatened the viability of planetary life-support\nsystems. The sense of environmental crisis stimulated by those and\nother popular works was intensified by NASA’s production and wide\ndissemination of a particularly potent image of Earth from space taken\nat Christmas 1968 and featured in the Scientific American in\nSeptember 1970. Here, plain to see, was a living, shining planet\nvoyaging through space and shared by all of humanity, a precious\nvessel vulnerable to pollution and to the overuse of its limited\ncapacities. In 1972 a team of researchers at MIT led by Dennis Meadows\npublished the Limits to Growth study, a work that summed up\nin many ways the emerging concerns of the previous decade and the\nsense of vulnerability triggered by the view of the Earth from\nspace. In the commentary to the study, the researchers wrote:  The call for a “basic change of values” in connection\nto the environment (a call that could be interpreted in terms of\neither instrumental or intrinsic values) reflected a need for the\ndevelopment of environmental ethics as a new sub-discipline of\nphilosophy. \nThe new field emerged almost simultaneously in three countries—the\nUnited States, Australia, and Norway. In the first two of these\ncountries, direction and inspiration largely came from the earlier\ntwentieth century American literature of the environment. For\ninstance, the Scottish emigrant John Muir (founder of the Sierra Club\nand “father of American conservation”) and subsequently the\nforester Aldo Leopold had advocated an appreciation and conservation\nof things “natural, wild and free”. Their concerns were\nmotivated by a combination of ethical and aesthetic responses to\nnature as well as a rejection of crudely economic approaches to the\nvalue of natural objects (a historical survey of the confrontation\nbetween Muir’s reverentialism and the human-centred conservationism of\nGifford Pinchot (one of the major influences on the development of the\nUS Forest Service) is provided in Norton 1991; also see Cohen 1984 and\nNash (ed) 1990). Leopold’s A Sand County Almanac (1949), in\nparticular, advocated the adoption of a “land ethic”: \nA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability,\nand beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends\notherwise. (Leopold 1949: 224–5) \nHowever, Leopold himself provided no systematic ethical theory or\nframework to support these ethical ideas concerning the\nenvironment. His views therefore presented a challenge and opportunity\nfor moral theorists: could some ethical theory be devised to justify\nthe injunction to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the\nbiosphere?  The land ethic sketched by Leopold, attempting to extend our moral\nconcern to cover the natural environment and its non-human contents,\nwas drawn on explicitly by the Australian philosopher Richard Routley\n(later Sylvan). According to Routley (1973 (cf. Routley and Routley\n1980)), the anthropocentrism imbedded in what he called the\n“dominant western view”, or “the western\nsuperethic”, is in effect “human chauvinism”. This\nview, he argued, is just another form of class chauvinism, which is\nsimply based on blind class “loyalty” or prejudice, and\nunjustifiably discriminates against those outside the privileged\nclass. Echoing the plot of a popular movie some three years earlier\n(see Lo and Brennan 2013), Routley speculates in his “last\nman” (and “last people”) arguments about a\nhypothetical situation in which the last person, surviving a world\ncatastrophe, acts to ensure the elimination of all other living things\nand the last people set about destroying forests and ecosystems after\ntheir demise. From the human-chauvinistic (or absolutely\nanthropocentric) perspective, the last person would do nothing morally\nwrong, since his or her destructive act in question would not cause\nany damage to the interest and well-being of humans, who would by then\nhave disappeared. Nevertheless, Routley points out that there is a\nmoral intuition that the imagined last acts would be morally wrong. An\nexplanation for this judgment, he argued, is that those non-human\nobjects in the environment, whose destruction is ensured by the last\nperson or last people, have intrinsic value, a kind of value\nindependent of their usefulness for humans. From his critique, Routley\nconcluded that the main approaches in traditional western moral\nthinking were unable to allow the recognition that natural things have\nintrinsic value, and that the tradition required overhaul of a\nsignificant kind.  Leopold’s idea that the “land” as a whole is an object\nof our moral concern also stimulated writers to argue for certain\nmoral obligations toward ecological wholes, such as species,\ncommunities, and ecosystems, not just their individual\nconstituents. The U.S.-based theologian and environmental philosopher\nHolmes Rolston III, for instance, argued that species protection was a\nmoral duty (Rolston 1975). It would be wrong, he maintained, to\neliminate a rare butterfly species simply to increase the monetary\nvalue of specimens already held by collectors. Like Routley’s\n“last man” arguments, Rolston’s example is meant to draw\nattention to a kind of action that seems morally dubious and yet is\nnot clearly ruled out or condemned by traditional anthropocentric\nethical views. Species, Rolston went on to argue, are intrinsically\nvaluable and are usually more valuable than individual specimens,\nsince the loss of a species is a loss of genetic possibilities and the\ndeliberate destruction of a species would show disrespect for the very\nbiological processes which make possible the emergence of individual\nliving things (also see Rolston 1989, Ch 10). Natural processes\ndeserve respect, according to Rolston’s quasi-religious perspective,\nbecause they constitute a nature (or God) which is itself\nintrinsically valuable (or sacred). \n Meanwhile, the work of Christopher Stone (a professor of law at the\nUniversity of Southern California) had become widely discussed. Stone\n(1972) proposed that trees and other natural objects should have at\nleast the same standing in law as corporations. This suggestion was\ninspired by a particular case in which the Sierra Club had mounted a\nchallenge against the permit granted by the U.S. Forest Service to\nWalt Disney Enterprises for surveys preparatory to the development of\nthe Mineral King Valley, which was at the time a relatively remote\ngame refuge, but not designated as a national park or protected\nwilderness area. The Disney proposal was to develop a major resort\ncomplex serving 14000 visitors daily to be accessed by a purpose-built\nhighway through Sequoia National Park. The Sierra Club, as a body with\na general concern for wilderness conservation, challenged the\ndevelopment on the grounds that the valley should be kept in its\noriginal state for its own sake. \n Stone reasoned that if trees, forests and mountains could be given\nstanding in law then they could be represented in their own right in\nthe courts by groups such as the Sierra Club. Moreover, like any other\nlegal person, these natural things could become beneficiaries\nof compensation if it could be shown that they had suffered\ncompensatable injury through human activity. When the case went to the\nU.S. Supreme Court, it was determined by a narrow majority that the\nSierra Club did not meet the condition for bringing a case to court,\nfor the Club was unable and unwilling to prove the likelihood of\ninjury to the interest of the Club or its members. In a dissenting\nminority judgment, however, justices Douglas, Blackmun and Brennan\nmentioned Stone’s argument: his proposal to give legal standing to\nnatural things, they said, would allow conservation interests,\ncommunity needs and business interests to be represented, debated and\nsettled in court. \nReacting to Stone’s proposal, Joel Feinberg (1974) raised a serious\nproblem. Only items that have interests, Feinberg argued, can be\nregarded as having legal standing and, likewise, moral standing. For\nit is interests which are capable of being represented in legal\nproceedings and moral debates. This same point would also seem to\napply to political debates. For instance, the movement for\n“animal liberation”, which also emerged strongly in the\n1970s, can be thought of as a political movement aimed at representing\nthe previously neglected interests of some animals (see Regan and\nSinger (eds.) 1976, Clark 1977, and also the entry on\n the moral status of animals). Granted that\nsome animals have interests that can be represented in this way, would\nit also make sense to speak of trees, forests, rivers, barnacles, or\ntermites as having interests of a morally relevant kind?  This issue\nwas hotly contested in the years that followed. Meanwhile, John\nPassmore (1974) argued, like White, that the Judeo-Christian tradition\nof thought about nature, despite being predominantly\n“despotic”, contained resources for regarding humans as\n“stewards” or “perfectors” of God’s\ncreation. Skeptical of the prospects for any radically new ethic,\nPassmore cautioned that traditions of thought could not be abruptly\noverhauled. Any change in attitudes to our natural surroundings which\nstood the chance of widespread acceptance, he argued, would have to\nresonate and have some continuities with the very tradition which had\nlegitimized our destructive practices. In sum, then, Leopold’s land\nethic, the historical analyses of White and Passmore, the pioneering\nwork of Routley, Stone and Rolston, and the warnings of scientists,\nhad by the late 1970s focused the attention of philosophers and\npolitical theorists firmly on the environment.  The confluence of ethical, political and legal debates about the\nenvironment, the emergence of philosophies to underpin animal rights\nactivism and the puzzles over whether an environmental ethic would be\nsomething new rather than a modification or extension of existing\nethical theories were reflected in wider social and political\nmovements. The rise of environmental or “green” parties in\nEurope in the 1980s was accompanied by almost immediate schisms\nbetween groups known as “realists” versus\n“fundamentalists” (see Dobson 1990). The\n“realists” stood for reform environmentalism, working with\nbusiness and government to soften the impact of pollution and resource\ndepletion especially on fragile ecosystems or endangered species. The\n“fundies” argued for radical change, the setting of\nstringent new priorities, and even the overthrow of capitalism and\nliberal individualism, which were taken as the major ideological\ncauses of anthropogenic environmental devastation. It is not clear,\nhowever, that collectivist or communist countries do any better in\nterms of their environmental record (see Dominick 1998).  Underlying these political disagreements was the distinction\nbetween “shallow” and “deep” environmental\nmovements, a distinction introduced in the early 1970s by another\nmajor influence on contemporary environmental ethics, the Norwegian\nphilosopher and climber Arne Næss. Since the work of Næss\nhas been significant in environmental politics, the discussion of his\nposition is given in a separate section below. \n“Deep ecology” was born in Scandinavia, the result of\ndiscussions between Næss and his colleagues Sigmund\nKvaløy and Nils Faarlund (see Næss 1973 and 1989; also\nsee Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999 for a historical survey and\ncommentary on the development of deep ecology). All three shared a\npassion for the great mountains. On a visit to the Himalayas, they\nbecame impressed with aspects of “Sherpa culture”\nparticularly when they found that their Sherpa guides regarded certain\nmountains as sacred and accordingly would not venture onto\nthem. Subsequently, Næss formulated a position which extended\nthe reverence the three Norwegians and the Sherpas felt for mountains\nto other natural things in general. \nThe “shallow ecology movement”, as Næss (1973) calls it,\nis the “fight against pollution and resource depletion”, the\ncentral objective of which is “the health and affluence of people\nin the developed countries.” The “deep ecology\nmovement”, in contrast, endorses “biospheric\negalitarianism”, the view that all living things are alike in\nhaving value in their own right, independent of their usefulness to\nothers. The deep ecologist respects this intrinsic value, taking care,\nfor example, when walking on the mountainside not to cause unnecessary\ndamage to the plants. \nInspired by Spinoza’s metaphysics, another key feature of Næss’s\ndeep ecology is the rejection of atomistic individualism. The idea\nthat a human being is such an individual possessing a separate\nessence, Næss argues, radically separates the human self from the\nrest of the world. To make such a separation not only leads to\nselfishness towards other people, but also induces human selfishness\ntowards nature. As a counter to egoism at both the individual and\nspecies level, Næss proposes the adoption of an alternative\nrelational “total-field image” of the\nworld. According to this relationalism, organisms (human or otherwise)\nare best understood as “knots” in the biospherical net. The\nidentity of a living thing is essentially constituted by its relations\nto other things in the world, especially its ecological relations to\nother living things. If people conceptualise themselves and the world\nin relational terms, the deep ecologists argue, then people will take\nbetter care of nature and the world in general. \nAs developed by Næss and others, the position also came to focus\non the possibility of the identification of the human ego\nwith nature. The idea is, briefly, that by identifying with nature I\ncan enlarge the boundaries of the self beyond my skin. My \nlarger—ecological—Self (the capital “S” emphasizes that I am\nsomething larger than my body and consciousness), deserves respect as\nwell. To respect and to care for my Self is also to respect and to\ncare for the natural environment, which is actually part of me and\nwith which I should identify. “Self-realization”, in other\nwords, is the reconnection of the shriveled human individual with the\nwider natural environment. Næss maintains that the deep\nsatisfaction that we receive from identification with nature and close\npartnership with other forms of life in nature contributes\nsignificantly to our life quality. (One clear historical antecedent to\nthis kind of nature spiritualism is the romanticism of Jean-Jacques\nRousseau as expressed in his last work, the Reveries of the\nSolitary Walker)  When Næss’s view crossed the Atlantic, it was sometimes\nmerged with ideas emerging from Leopold’s land ethic (see Devall and\nSessions 1985; also see Sessions (ed) 1995). But \nNæss—wary of the apparent totalitarian \npolitical implications of Leopold’s\nposition that individual interests and well-being should be\nsubordinated to the holistic good of the Earth’s biotic community (see\nsection 4 below)—has always taken care to distance himself\nfrom advocating any sort of “land ethic”. (See Anker 1999\nfor cautions on interpreting Næss’s relationalism as an\nendorsement of the kind of holism displayed in the land ethic;\ncf. Grey 1993, Taylor and Zimmerman 2005). Some critics have argued\nthat Næss’s deep ecology is no more than an extended\nsocial-democratic version of utilitarianism, which counts human\ninterests in the same calculation alongside the interests of all\nnatural things (e.g., trees, wolves, bears, rivers, forests and\nmountains) in the natural environment (see Witoszek 1997). However,\nNæss failed to explain in any detail how to make sense of the\nidea that oysters or barnacles, termites or bacteria could have\ninterests of any morally relevant sort at all. Without an account of\nthis, Næss’s early “biospheric egalitarianism”—that \nall living things whatsoever had a similar right to live\nand flourish—was an indeterminate principle in practical\nterms. It also remains unclear in what sense rivers, mountains and\nforests can be regarded as possessors of any kind of interests. This\nis an issue on which Næss always remained elusive. \nBiospheric egalitarianism was modified in the 1980s to the weaker\nclaim that the flourishing of both human and non-human life have value\nin themselves. At the same time, Næss declared that his own\nfavoured ecological philosophy—“Ecosophy T”, as he called\nit after his Tvergastein mountain cabin—was only one of several\npossible foundations for an environmental ethic. Deep ecology ceased\nto be a specific doctrine, but instead became a “platform”,\nof eight simple points, on which Næss hoped all deep green thinkers\ncould agree. The platform was conceived as establishing a middle\nground, between underlying philosophical orientations, whether\nChristian, Buddhist, Daoist, process philosophy, or whatever, and the\npractical principles for action in specific situations, principles\ngenerated from the underlying philosophies. Thus the deep ecological\nmovement became explicitly pluralist (see Brennan 1999; c.f. Light\n1996). \nWhile Næss’s Ecosophy T sees human Self-realization as a solution\nto the environmental crises resulting from human selfishness and\nexploitation of nature, some of the followers of the deep ecology\nplatform in the United States and Australia further argue that the\nexpansion of the human self to include non-human nature is supported by\nthe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, which is said to have\ndissolved the boundaries between the observer and the observed (see\nFox 1984, 1990, and Devall and Sessions 1985; cf. Callicott\n1985). These \"relationalist\" developments of deep ecology are,\nhowever, criticized by some feminist theorists. The idea of nature as\npart of oneself, one might argue, could justify the continued\nexploitation of nature instead. For one is presumably more entitled to\ntreat oneself in whatever ways one likes than to treat another\nindependent agent in whatever ways one likes. According to some\nfeminist critics, the deep ecological theory of the “expanded\nself” is in effect a disguised form of human colonialism, unable\nto give nature its due as a genuine “other” independent of\nhuman interest and purposes (see Plumwood 1993, Ch. 7, 1999, and\nWarren 1999).  \nMeanwhile, some third-world critics accused deep ecology of\nbeing elitist in its attempts to preserve wilderness experiences for\nonly a select group of economically and socio-politically well-off\npeople. The Indian writer Ramachandra Guha (1989, 1999) for instance,\ndepicts the activities of many western-based conservation groups as a\nnew form of cultural imperialism, aimed at securing converts to\nconservationism (cf. Bookchin 1987 and Brennan 1998a). “Green\nmissionaries”, as Guha calls them, represent a movement aimed at\nfurther dispossessing the world’s poor and indigenous\npeople. “Putting deep ecology in its place,” he writes,\n“is to recognize that the trends it derides as\n“shallow” ecology might in fact be varieties of\nenvironmentalism that are more apposite, more representative and more\npopular in the countries of the South.” Although Næss himself\nrepudiates suggestions that deep ecology is committed to any\nimperialism (see Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999, Ch. 36–7 and 41),\nGuha’s criticism raises important questions about the application of\ndeep ecological principles in different social, economic and cultural\ncontexts. Finally, in other critiques, deep ecology is portrayed as\nhaving an inconsistent utopian vision (see Anker and Witoszek\n1998). \nBroadly speaking, a feminist issue is any that contributes in some\nway to understanding the oppression of women. Feminist theories\nattempt to analyze women’s oppression, its causes and consequences,\nand suggest strategies and directions for women’s liberation. By the\nmid 1970s, feminist writers had raised the issue of whether\npatriarchal modes of thinking encouraged not only widespread\ninferiorizing and colonizing of women, but also of people of colour,\nanimals and nature. Sheila Collins (1974), for instance, argued that\nmale-dominated culture or patriarchy is supported by four interlocking\npillars: sexism, racism, class exploitation, and ecological\ndestruction. \nEmphasizing the importance of feminism to the environmental movement\nand various other liberation movements, some writers, such as Ynestra\nKing (1989a and 1989b), argue that the domination of women by men is\nhistorically the original form of domination in human society, from\nwhich all other hierarchies—of rank, class, and political\npower—flow. For instance, human exploitation of nature may be\nseen as a manifestation and extension of the oppression of women, in\nthat it is the result of associating nature with the female, which had\nbeen already inferiorized and oppressed by the male-dominating\nculture. But within the plurality of feminist positions, other\nwriters, such as Val Plumwood (1993), understand the oppression of\nwomen as only one of the many parallel forms of oppression sharing and\nsupported by a common ideological structure, in which one party (the\ncolonizer) uses a number of conceptual and rhetorical devices to\nprivilege its interests over that of the other party (the\ncolonized). Facilitated by a common structure, seemingly diverse forms\nof oppression can mutually reinforce each other (Warren 1987, 1990,\n1994, Cheney 1989, and Plumwood 1993). \nNot all feminist theorists would call that common underlying\noppressive structure “androcentric” or\n“patriarchal”. But it is generally agreed that core features\nof the structure include “dualism”, hierarchical thinking,\nand the “logic of domination”, which are typical of, if not\nessential to, male-chauvinism. These patterns of thinking and\nconceptualizing the world, many feminist theorists argue, also nourish\nand sustain other forms of chauvinism, including, human-chauvinism\n(i.e., anthropocentrism), which is responsible for much human\nexploitation of, and destructiveness towards, nature. The dualistic\nway of thinking, for instance, sees the world in polar opposite terms,\nsuch as male/female, masculinity/femininity, reason/emotion,\nfreedom/necessity, active/passive, mind/body, pure/soiled,\nwhite/coloured, civilized/primitive, transcendent/immanent,\nhuman/animal, culture/nature. Furthermore, under dualism all the first\nitems in these contrasting pairs are assimilated with each other, and\nall the second items are likewise linked with each other. For example,\nthe male is seen to be associated with the rational, active, creative,\nCartesian human mind, and civilized, orderly, transcendent culture;\nwhereas the female is regarded as tied to the emotional, passive,\ndetermined animal body, and primitive, disorderly, immanent\nnature. These interlocking dualisms are not just descriptive\ndichotomies, according to the feminists, but involve a prescriptive\nprivileging of one side of the opposed items over the other. Dualism\nconfers superiority to everything on the male side, but inferiority to\neverything on the female side. The “logic of domination”\nthen dictates that those on the superior side (e.g., men, rational\nbeings, humans) are morally entitled to dominate and utilize those on\nthe inferior side (e.g., women, beings lacking in rationality,\nnon-humans) as mere means. \nThe problem with dualistic and hierarchical modes of thinking,\nhowever, is not just that that they are epistemically unreliable. It\nis not just that the dominating party often falsely sees the dominated\nparty as lacking (or possessing) the allegedly superior (or inferior)\nqualities, or that the dominated party often internalizes false\nstereotypes of itself given by its oppressors, or that stereotypical\nthinking often overlooks salient and important differences among\nindividuals. More important, according to feminist analyses, the very\npremise of prescriptive dualism—the valuing of attributes of one\npolarized side and the devaluing of those of the other, the idea that\ndomination and oppression can be justified by appealing to attributes\nlike masculinity, rationality, being civilized or developed, etc.—is \nitself problematic. \nFeminism represents a radical challenge for environmental thinking,\npolitics, and traditional social ethical perspectives. It promises to\nlink environmental questions with wider social problems concerning\nvarious kinds of discrimination and exploitation, and fundamental\ninvestigations of human psychology. However, whether there are\nconceptual, causal or merely contingent connections among the\ndifferent forms of oppression and liberation remains a contested issue\n(see Green 1994). The term “ecofeminism” (first coined by\nFrançoise d’Eaubonne in 1974) or “ecological\nfeminism” was for a time generally applied to any view that\ncombines environmental advocacy with feminist analysis. However,\nbecause of the varieties of, and disagreements among, feminist\ntheories, the label may be too wide to be informative and has\ngenerally fallen from use. \nAn often overlooked source of ecological ideas is the work of the\nneo-Marxist Frankfurt School of critical theory founded by Max\nHorkheimer and Theodore Adorno (Horkheimer and Adorno 1969). While\nclassical Marxists regard nature as a resource to be transformed by\nhuman labour and utilized for human purposes, Horkheimer and Adorno\nsaw Marx himself as representative of the problem of “human\nalienation”. At the root of this alienation, they argue, is a\nnarrow positivist conception of rationality—which sees rationality\nas an instrument for pursuing progress, power and technological\ncontrol, and takes observation, measurement and the application of\npurely quantitative methods to be capable of solving all\nproblems. Such a positivistic view of science combines determinism\nwith optimism. Natural processes as well as human activities are seen\nto be predictable and manipulable. Nature (and, likewise, human\nnature) is no longer mysterious, uncontrollable, or fearsome. Instead,\nit is reduced to an object strictly governed by natural laws, which\ntherefore can be studied, known, and employed to our benefit. By\npromising limitless knowledge and power, the positivism of science and\ntechnology not only removes our fear of nature, the critical theorists\nargue, but also destroys our sense of awe and wonder towards it. That\nis to say, positivism “disenchants” nature—along with\neverything that can be studied by the sciences, whether natural,\nsocial or human. \nThe progress in knowledge and material well-being may not be a bad\nthing in itself, where the consumption and control of nature is a\nnecessary part of human life. However, the critical theorists argue\nthat the positivistic disenchantment of natural things (and, likewise,\nof human beings—because they too can be studied and manipulated by\nscience) disrupts our relationship with them, encouraging the\nundesirable attitude that they are nothing more than things to be\nprobed, consumed and dominated. According to the critical theorists,\nthe oppression of “outer nature” (i.e., the natural\nenvironment) through science and technology is bought at a very high\nprice: the project of domination requires the suppression of our own\n“inner nature” (i.e., human nature)—e.g., human\ncreativity, autonomy, and the manifold needs, vulnerabilities and\nlongings at the centre of human life. To remedy such an alienation,\nthe project of Horkheimer and Adorno is to replace the narrow\npositivistic and instrumentalist model of rationality with a more\nhumanistic one, in which the values of the aesthetic, moral, sensuous\nand expressive aspects of human life play a central part. Thus, their\naim is not to give up our rational faculties or powers of analysis and\nlogic. Rather, the ambition is to arrive at a dialectical synthesis\nbetween Romanticism and Enlightenment, to return to anti-deterministic\nvalues of freedom, spontaneity and creativity.  In his later work, Adorno advocates a re-enchanting aesthetic\nattitude of “sensuous immediacy” towards nature. Not only\ndo we stop seeing nature as primarily, or simply, an object of\nconsumption, we are also able to be directly and spontaneously\nacquainted with nature without interventions from our rational\nfaculties. According to Adorno, works of art, like natural things,\nalways involve an “excess”, something more than their mere\nmateriality and exchange value (see Vogel 1996, ch. 4.4 for a detailed\ndiscussion of Adorno’s views on art, labour and domination). The\nre-enchantment of the world through aesthetic experience, he argues,\nis also at the same time a re-enchantment of human lives and\npurposes. Adorno’s work remains largely unexplored in mainstream\nenvironmental philosophy, although the idea of applying critical\ntheory (embracing techniques of deconstruction, psychoanalysis and\nradical social criticism) to both environmental issues and the\nwritings of various ethical and political theorists has spawned an\nemerging field of “ecocritique” or\n“eco-criticism” (Vogel 1996, Luke 1997, van Wyk 1997,\nDryzek 1997). \nSome students of Adorno’s work have argued that his account\nof the role of “sensuous immediacy” can be understood as\nan attempt to defend a “legitimate anthropomorphism” that\ncomes close to a weak form of animism (Bernstein 2001, 196). Others,\nmore radical, have claimed to take inspiration from his notion of\n“non-identity”, which, they argue, can be used as the\nbasis for a deconstruction of the notion of nature and perhaps even\nits elimination from eco-critical writing. For example, Timothy Morton\nargues that “putting something called Nature on a pedestal and\nadmiring it from afar does for the environment what patriarchy does\nfor the figure of Woman. It is a paradoxical act of sadistic\nadmiration” (Morton 2007, 5), and that “in the name of all\nthat we value in the idea of ‘nature’, [ecocritique]\nthoroughly examines how nature is set up as a transcendental, unified,\nindependent category. Ecocritique does not think that it is\nparadoxical to say, in the name of ecology itself: ‘down with\nnature!’ ” (ibid., 13). \nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the radical attempt to purge\nthe concept of nature from eco-critical work meets with\nsuccess. Likewise, it is unclear whether the dialectic project on\nwhich Horkheimer and Adorno embarked is coherent, and whether Adorno,\nin particular, has a consistent understanding of “nature”\nand “rationality” (see Eckersley 1992 and Vogel 1996, for a\nreview of the Frankfurt School’s thinking about nature). \nOn the other hand, the  new animists have been much inspired\nby the serious way in which some indigenous peoples placate and\ninteract with animals, plants and inanimate things through ritual,\nceremony and other practices. According to the new animists, the\nreplacement of traditional animism (the view that personalized souls\nare found in animals, plants, and other material objects) by a form of\ndisenchanting positivism directly leads to an anthropocentric\nperspective, which is accountable for much human destructiveness\ntowards nature. In a disenchanted world, there is no meaningful order\nof things or events outside the human domain, and there is no source\nof sacredness or dread of the sort felt by those who regard the\nnatural world as peopled by divinities or demons (Stone 2006). When a\nforest is no longer sacred, there are no spirits to be placated and no\nmysterious risks associated with clear-felling it. A disenchanted\nnature is no longer alive. It commands no respect, reverence or\nlove. It is nothing but a giant machine, to be mastered to serve human\npurposes. The new animists argue for reconceptualizing the boundary\nbetween persons and non-persons. For them, “living nature”\ncomprises not only humans, animals and plants, but also mountains,\nforests, rivers, deserts, and even planets. \nWhether the notion that a mountain or a tree is to be regarded as a\nperson is taken literally or not, the attempt to engage with the\nsurrounding world as if it consists of other persons might possibly\nprovide the basis for a respectful attitude to nature (see Harvey 2005\nfor a popular account of the new animism). If disenchantment is a\nsource of environmental problems and destruction, then the new animism\ncan be regarded as attempting to re-enchant, and help to save,\nnature. More poetically, David Abram has argued that a\nphenomenological approach of the kind taken by Merleau-Ponty can\nreveal to us that we are part of the “common flesh” of the\nworld, that we are in a sense the world thinking itself (Abram\n1995). \nIn her work, Freya Mathews has tried to articulate a version\nof animism or panpsychism that captures ways in which the world (not\njust nature) contains many kinds of consciousness and sentience. For\nher, there is an underlying unity of mind and matter in that the world\nis a “self-realizing” system containing a multiplicity of\nother such systems (cf. Næss). According to Mathews, we are\nmeshed in communication, and potential communication, with the\n“One” (the greater cosmic self) and its many lesser selves\n(Mathews 2003, 45–60). Materialism (the monistic theory that the\nworld consists purely of matter), she argues, is self-defeating by\nencouraging a form of “collective solipsism” that treats\nthe world either as unknowable or as a social-construction (Mathews\n2005, 12). Mathews also takes inspiration from her interpretation of\nthe core Daoist idea of  wuwei  as “letting be” and bringing\nabout change through “effortless action”. The focus in\nenvironmental management, development and commerce should be on\n“synergy” with what is already in place rather than on\ndemolition, replacement and disruption. Instead of bulldozing away old\nsuburbs and derelict factories, the synergistic panpsychist sees these\nartefacts as themselves part of the living cosmos, hence part of what\nis to be respected. Likewise, instead of trying to eliminate feral or\nexotic plants and animals, and restore environments to some imagined\npristine state, ways should be found—wherever possible—to\npromote synergies between the newcomers and the older native\npopulations in ways that maintain ecological flows and promote the\nfurther unfolding and developing of ecological processes (Mathews\n2004). Panpsychism, Mathews argues, frees us from the\n“ideological grid of capitalism”, can reduce our desire\nfor consumer novelties, and can allow us and the world to grow old\ntogether with grace and dignity. \nIn summary, if disenchantment is a source of environmentally\ndestructive or uncaring attitudes, then both the aesthetic and the\nanimist/panpsychist re-enchantment of the world are intended to offer\nan antidote to such attitudes, and perhaps also inspirations for new\nforms of managing and designing for sustainability. \nApart from feminist-environmentalist theories and Næss’s deep\necology, Murray Bookchin’s “social ecology” has also claimed\nto be radical, subversive, or countercultural (see Bookchin 1980,\n1987, 1990). Bookchin’s version of critical theory takes the\n“outer” physical world as constituting what he calls\n“first nature”, from which culture or “second\nnature” has evolved. Environmentalism, on his view, is a social\nmovement, and the problems it confronts are social problems. While\nBookchin is prepared, like Horkheimer and Adorno, to regard (first)\nnature as an aesthetic and sensuous marvel, he regards our\nintervention in it as necessary. He suggests that we can choose to put\nourselves at the service of natural evolution, to help maintain\ncomplexity and diversity, diminish suffering and reduce\npollution. Bookchin’s social ecology recommends that we use our gifts\nof sociability, communication and intelligence as if we were\n“nature rendered conscious”, instead of turning them against\nthe very source and origin from which such gifts derive. Exploitation\nof nature should be replaced by a richer form of life devoted to\nnature’s preservation. \nJohn Clark has argued that social ecology is heir to a historical,\ncommunitarian tradition of thought that includes not only the\nanarchist Peter Kropotkin, but also the nineteenth century socialist\ngeographer Elisée Reclus, the eccentric Scottish thinker\nPatrick Geddes and the latter’s disciple, Lewis Mumford (Clark\n1998). Ramachandra Guha has described Mumford as “the pioneer\nAmerican social ecologist” (Guha 1996, 210). Mumford adopted a\nregionalist perspective, arguing that strong regional centres of\nculture are the basis of “active and securely grounded local\nlife” (Mumford 1944, 403). Like the pessimists in critical\ntheory, Mumford was worried about the emergence under industrialised\ncapitalism of a “megamachine”, one that would oppress and\ndominate human creativity and freedom, and one that—despite being a\nhuman product—operates in a way that is out of our control. While\nBookchin is more of a technological optimist than Mumford, both\nwriters have inspired a regional turn in environmental\nthinking. Bioregionalism gives regionalism an environmental\ntwist. This is the view that natural features should provide the\ndefining conditions for places of community, and that secure and\nsatisfying local lives are led by those who know a place, have learned\nits lore and who adapt their lifestyle to its affordances by\ndeveloping its potential within ecological limits. Such a life, the\nbioregionalists argue, will enable people to enjoy the fruits of\nself-liberation and self-development (see the essays in List 1993, and\nthe book-length treatment in Thayer 2003, for an introduction to\nbioregional thought). \nHowever, critics have asked why natural features should significant\nin defining the places in which communities are to be built, and have\npuzzled over exactly which natural features these should be—geological, \necological, climatic, hydrological, and so on (see Brennan\n1998b). If relatively small, bioregional communities are to be home to\nflourishing human societies, then a question also arises over the\nnature of the laws and punishments that will prevail in them, and also\nof their integration into larger regional and global political and\neconomic groupings. For anarchists and other critics of the\npredominant social order, a return to self-governing and\nself-sufficient regional communities is often depicted as liberating\nand refreshing. But for the skeptics, the worry remains that the\nbioregional vision is politically over-optimistic and is open to the\nestablishment of illiberal, stifling and undemocratic communities.\nFurther, given its emphasis on local self-sufficiency and the virtue\nof life in small communities, a question arises over whether\nbioregionalism is workable in an overcrowded planet. \nDeep ecology, feminism, and social ecology have had a considerable\nimpact on the development of political positions in regard to the\nenvironment. Feminist analyses have often been welcomed for the\npsychological insight they bring to several social, moral and\npolitical problems. There is, however, considerable unease about the\nimplications of critical theory, social ecology and some varieties of\ndeep ecology and animism. Some writers have argued, for\nexample, that critical theory is bound to be ethically\nanthropocentric, with nature as no more than a “social\nconstruction” whose value ultimately depends on human\ndeterminations (see Vogel 1996). Others have argued that the demands\nof “deep” green theorists and activists cannot be\naccommodated within contemporary theories of liberal politics and\nsocial justice (see Ferry 1998). A further suggestion is that there is\na need to reassess traditional theories such as virtue ethics, which\nhas its origins in ancient Greek philosophy (see the following\nsection) within the context of a form of stewardship similar to that\nearlier endorsed by Passmore (see Barry 1999). If this last claim is\ncorrect, then the radical activist need not, after all, look for\nphilosophical support in radical, or countercultural, theories of the\nsort deep ecology, feminism, bioregionalism and social ecology claim\nto be (but see Zimmerman 1994). \nAlthough environmental ethicists often try to distance themselves\nfrom the anthropocentrism embedded in traditional ethical views\n(Passmore 1974, Norton 1991 are exceptions), they also quite often\ndraw their theoretical resources from traditional ethical systems and\ntheories. Consider the following two basic moral questions: (1) What\nkinds of thing are intrinsically valuable, good or bad? (2) What makes\nan action right or wrong? \nConsequentialist ethical theories consider intrinsic\n“value” / “disvalue” or “goodness” /\n“badness” to be more fundamental moral notions than\n“rightness” / “wrongness”, and maintain that\nwhether an action is right/wrong is determined by whether its\nconsequences are good/bad. From this perspective, answers to question\n(2) are informed by answers to question (1). For instance,\nutilitarianism, a paradigm case of consequentialism, regards pleasure\n(or, more broadly construed, the satisfaction of interest, desire,\nand/or preference) as the only intrinsic value in the world, whereas\npain (or the frustration of desire, interest, and/or preference) is the\nonly intrinsic disvalue, and maintains that right actions are those\nthat would produce the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. \nAs the utilitarian focus is the balance of pleasure and pain as such,\nthe question of to whom a pleasure or pain belongs is irrelevant to\nthe calculation and assessment of the rightness or wrongness of\nactions. Hence, the eighteenth century utilitarian Jeremy Bentham\n(1789), and now Peter Singer (1993), have argued that the interests of\nall the sentient beings (i.e., beings who are capable of experiencing\npleasure or pain)—including non-human ones—affected by an action\nshould be taken equally into consideration in assessing the\naction. Furthermore, rather like Routley (see section 2 above), Singer\nargues that the anthropocentric privileging of members of the species\nHomo sapiens is arbitrary, and that it is a kind of\n“speciesism” as unjustifiable as sexism and racism. Singer\nregards the animal liberation movement as comparable to the liberation\nmovements of women and people of colour. Unlike the environmental\nphilosophers who attribute intrinsic value to the natural environment\nand its inhabitants, Singer and utilitarians in general attribute\nintrinsic value to the experience of pleasure or interest satisfaction\nas such, not to the beings who have the experience. Similarly, for the\nutilitarian, non-sentient objects in the environment such as plant\nspecies, rivers, mountains, and landscapes, all of which are the\nobjects of moral concern for environmentalists, are of no intrinsic\nbut at most instrumental value to the satisfaction of sentient beings\n(see Singer 1993, Ch. 10). Furthermore, because right actions, for the\nutilitarian, are those that maximize the overall balance of interest\nsatisfaction over frustration, practices such as whale-hunting and the\nkilling of an elephant for ivory, which cause suffering to non-human\nanimals, might turn out to be right after all: such practices might\nproduce considerable amounts of interest-satisfaction for human\nbeings, which, on the utilitarian calculation, outweigh the non-human\ninterest-frustration involved. As the result of all the above\nconsiderations, it is unclear to what extent a utilitarian ethic can\nalso be an environmental ethic. This point may not so readily apply to\na wider consequentialist approach, which attributes intrinsic value\nnot only to pleasure or satisfaction, but also to various objects and\nprocesses in the natural environment. \nDeontological ethical theories, in contrast, maintain that\nwhether an action is right or wrong is for the most part independent\nof whether its consequences are good or bad. From the deontologist\nperspective, there are several distinct moral rules or duties (e.g.,\n“not to kill or otherwise harm the innocent”, “not to\nlie”, “to respect the rights of others”, “to keep\npromises”), the observance/violation of which is intrinsically\nright/wrong; i.e., right/wrong in itself regardless of\nconsequences. When asked to justify an alleged moral rule, duty or its\ncorresponding right, deontologists may appeal to the intrinsic value\nof those beings to whom it applies. For instance, “animal\nrights” advocate Tom Regan (1983) argues that those animals with\nintrinsic value (or what he calls “inherent value”) have the\nmoral right to respectful treatment, which then generates a general\nmoral duty on our part not to treat them as mere means to other\nends. We have, in particular, a prima facie moral duty not to harm\nthem. Regan maintains that certain practices (such as sport or\ncommercial hunting, and experimentation on animals) violate the moral\nright of intrinsically valuable animals to respectful treatment. Such\npractices, he argues, are intrinsically wrong regardless of whether or\nnot some better consequences ever flow from them. Exactly which\nanimals have intrinsic value and therefore the moral right to\nrespectful treatment? Regan’s answer is: those that meet the criterion\nof being the “subject-of-a-life”. To be such a subject is a\nsufficient (though not necessary) condition for having intrinsic\nvalue, and to be a subject-of-a-life involves, among other things,\nhaving sense-perceptions, beliefs, desires, motives, memory, a sense\nof the future, and a psychological identity over time. \nSome authors have extended concern for individual well-being further,\narguing for the intrinsic value of organisms achieving their own good,\nwhether those organisms are capable of consciousness or not. Paul\nTaylor’s version of this view (1981 and 1986), which we might call\nbiocentrism, is a deontological example. He argues that each\nindividual living thing in nature—whether it is an animal, a plant,\nor a micro-organism—is a “teleological-center-of-life”\nhaving a good or well-being of its own which can be enhanced or\ndamaged, and that all individuals who are teleological-centers-of life\nhave equal intrinsic value (or what he calls “inherent\nworth”) which entitles them to moral respect. Furthermore, Taylor\nmaintains that the intrinsic value of wild living things generates a\nprima facie moral duty on our part to preserve or promote their goods\nas ends in themselves, and that any practices which treat those beings\nas mere means and thus display a lack of respect for them are\nintrinsically wrong.  A more recent and biologically detailed defence\nof the idea that living things have representations and goals and\nhence have moral worth is found in Agar 2001. Unlike Taylor’s\negalitarian and deontological biocentrism, Robin Attfield (1987)\nargues for a hierarchical view that while all beings having a good of\ntheir own have intrinsic value, some of them (e.g., persons) have\nintrinsic value to a greater extent. Attfield also endorses a form of\nconsequentialism which takes into consideration, and attempts to\nbalance, the many and possibly conflicting goods of different living\nthings (also see Varner 1998 for a defense of biocentric\nindividualism with affinities to both consequentialist and\ndeontological approaches). However, some critics have pointed out that\nthe notion of biological good or well-being is only descriptive not\nprescriptive (see Williams 1992 and O’Neill 1993, Ch. 2). For\ninstance, even if HIV has a good of its own this does not mean that\nwe ought to assign any positive moral weight to the realization of\nthat good. \nMore recently, the distinction between these two traditional\napproaches has taken its own specific form of development in\nenvironmental philosophy.  Instead of pitting conceptions of value\nagainst conceptions of rights, it has been suggested that there may be\ntwo different conceptions of intrinsic value in play in discussion\nabout environmental good and evil.  One the one side, there is the\nintrinsic value of states of affairs that are to be promoted - and\nthis is the focus of the consequentialist thinkers.  On the other\n(deontological) hand there is the intrinsic values of entities to be\nrespected (see Bradley 2006, McShane 2014).  These two different foci\nfor the notion of intrinsic value still provide room for fundamental\nargument between deontologists and consequentialist to continue,\nalbeit in a somewhat modified form.\n \nNote that the ethics of animal liberation or animal rights and\nbiocentrism are both individualistic in that their various\nmoral concerns are directed towards individuals only—not ecological\nwholes such as species, populations, biotic communities, and\necosystems. None of these is sentient, a subject-of-a-life, or a\nteleological-center-of-life, but the preservation of these collective\nentities is a major concern for many environmentalists. Moreover, the\ngoals of animal liberationists, such as the reduction of animal\nsuffering and death, may conflict with the goals of\nenvironmentalists. For example, the preservation of the integrity of\nan ecosystem may require the culling of feral animals or of some\nindigenous animal populations that threaten to destroy fragile habitats. So\nthere are disputes about whether the ethics of animal liberation is a\nproper branch of environmental ethics (see Callicott 1980, 1988,\nSagoff 1984, Jamieson 1998, Crisp 1998 and Varner 2000). \nCriticizing the individualistic approach in general for failing to\naccommodate conservation concerns for ecological wholes, J. Baird\nCallicott (1980) once advocated a version of land-ethical\nholism which takes Leopold’s statement “A thing is right\nwhen it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the\nbiotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise” to be the\nsupreme deontological principle. In this theory, the Earth’s biotic\ncommunity per se is the sole locus of intrinsic value, whereas the\nvalue of its individual members is merely instrumental and dependent\non their contribution to the “integrity, stability, and\nbeauty” of the larger community. A straightforward implication of\nthis version of the land ethic is that an individual member of the\nbiotic community ought to be sacrificed whenever that is needed for\nthe protection of the holistic good of the community. For instance,\nCallicott maintains that if culling a white-tailed deer is necessary\nfor the protection of the holistic biotic good, then it is a\nland-ethical requirement to do so. But, to be consistent, the same\npoint also applies to human individuals because they are also members\nof the biotic community. Not surprisingly, the misanthropy implied by\nCallicott’s land-ethical holism was widely criticized and\nregarded as a reductio of the position (see Aiken (1984), Kheel\n(1985), Ferré (1996), and Shrader-Frechette (1996)). Tom Regan\n(1983, p.362), in particular, condemned the holistic land ethic’s\ndisregard of the rights of the individual as “environmental\nfascism”.   Under pressure from the charge of ecofascism and misanthropy,\nCallicott (1989 Ch. 5, and 1999, Ch. 4) later revised his position and\nnow maintains that the biotic community (indeed, any community to\nwhich we belong) as well as its individual members (indeed, any\nindividual who shares with us membership in some common community) all\nhave intrinsic value. To further distance himself from the charge of\necofascism, Callicott introduced explicit principles which prioritize\nobligations to human communities over those to natural ones.  He\ncalled these “second-order” principles for specifying the\nconditions under which the land ethic’s holistic and individualistic\nobligations were to be ranked.  As he put it: \nLo (in Lo 2001) provides an overview and critique of Callicott’s\nchanging position over two decades, while Ouderkirk and Hill (eds.)\n2002 gives an overview of debates between Callicott and others\nconcerning the metaethical and metaphysical foundations for the land\nethic and also its historical antecedents.  As Lo pointed out, the\nfinal modified version of the land ethic needs more than two\nsecond-order principles, since a third-order principle is needed to\nspecify Callicott’s implicit view that the second second-order\nprinciple generally countermands the first one when they come into\nconflict (Lo 2001, 345).  In his most recent work, Callicott follows\nLo’s suggestion, while cautioning against aiming for too much\nprecision in specifying the demands of the land ethic (Callicott 2013,\n66 - 7).  The controversy surrounding Callicott’s original position,\nhowever, has inspired efforts in environmental ethics to investigate\npossibilities of attributing intrinsic value to ecological wholes, not\njust their individual constituent parts.  Following in Callicott’s\nfootsteps, and inspired by Næss’s relational account of value,\nWarwick Fox has championed a theory of “responsive\ncohesion” which apparently gives supreme moral priority to the\nmaintenance of ecosystems and the biophysical world (Fox 2007).  It\nremains to be seen if this position escapes the charges of misanthropy\nand totalitarianism laid against earlier holistic and relational\ntheories of value.  \nIndividual natural entities (whether sentient or not, living or not),\nAndrew Brennan (1984, 2014) argues, are not designed by anyone to fulfill\nany purpose and therefore lack “intrinsic function” (i.e.,\nthe function of a thing that constitutes part of its essence or\nidentity conditions). This, he proposes, is a reason for thinking that\nindividual natural entities should not be treated as mere instruments,\nand thus a reason for assigning them intrinsic value. Furthermore, he\nargues that the same moral point applies to the case of natural\necosystems, to the extent that they lack intrinsic function. In the\nlight of Brennan’s proposal, Eric Katz (1991 and 1997) argues that all\nnatural entities, whether individuals or wholes, have intrinsic value\nin virtue of their ontological independence from human purpose,\nactivity, and interest, and maintains the deontological principle that\nnature as a whole is an “autonomous subject” which deserves\nmoral respect and must not be treated as a mere means to human\nends. Carrying the project of attributing intrinsic value to nature to\nits ultimate form, Robert Elliot (1997) argues that naturalness itself\nis a property in virtue of possessing which all natural things,\nevents, and states of affairs, attain intrinsic value. Furthermore,\nElliot argues that even a consequentialist, who in principle allows\nthe possibility of trading off intrinsic value from naturalness for\nintrinsic value from other sources, could no longer justify such kind\nof trade-off in reality. This is because the reduction of intrinsic\nvalue due to the depletion of naturalness on Earth, according to him,\nhas reached such a level that any further reduction of it could not be\ncompensated by any amount of intrinsic value generated in other ways,\nno matter how great it is.  As the notion of “natural” is understood in terms of\nthe lack of human contrivance and is often opposed to the notion of\n“artifactual”, one much contested issue is about the value\nof those parts of nature that have been interfered with by human\nartifice—for instance, previously degraded natural environments\nwhich have been humanly restored. Based on the premise that the\nproperties of being naturally evolved and having a natural continuity\nwith the remote past are “value adding” (i.e., adding\nintrinsic value to those things which possess those two properties),\nElliot argues that even a perfectly restored environment would\nnecessarily lack those two value-adding properties and therefore be\nless valuable than the originally undegraded natural\nenvironment. Katz, on the other hand, argues that a restored nature is\nreally just an artifact designed and created for the satisfaction of\nhuman ends, and that the value of restored environments is merely\ninstrumental. However, some critics have pointed out that advocates of\nmoral dualism between the natural and the artifactual run the risk of\ndiminishing the value of human life and culture, and fail to recognize\nthat the natural environments interfered with by humans may still have\nmorally relevant qualities other than pure naturalness (see Lo\n1999). Two other issues central to this debate are that the key\nconcept “natural” seems ambiguous in many different ways\n(see Hume 1751, App. 3; Mill 1874; Brennan [1988] 2014; Ch. 6; Elliot 1997,\nCh. 4), and that those who argue that human interference reduces the\nintrinsic value of nature seem to have simply assumed the crucial\npremise that naturalness is a source of intrinsic value. Some thinkers\nmaintain that the natural, or the “wild” construed as that\nwhich “is not humanized” (Hettinger and Throop 1999,\np. 12) or to some degree “not under human control” (ibid.,\np. 13) is intrinsically valuable. Yet, as Bernard Williams points out\n(Williams 1992), we may, paradoxically, need to use our technological\npowers to retain a sense of something not being in our power. The\nretention of wild areas may thus involve planetary and ecological\nmanagement to maintain, or even “imprison” such areas\n(Birch 1990), raising a question over the extent to which national\nparks and wilderness areas are free from our control. An important\nmessage underlying the debate, perhaps, is that even if ecological\nrestoration is achievable, it might have been better to have left\nnature intact in the first place. \nGiven the significance of the concept of naturalness in these debates,\nit is perhaps surprising that there has been relatively little\nanalysis of that concept itself in environmental thought.  In his\npioneering work on the ethics of the environment, Holmes Rolston has\nworked with a number of different conceptions of the natural (see\nBrennan and Lo 2010, pp.116–23, for an analysis three senses of\nthe term \"natural\" that may be found in Rolston’s work).  An explicit\nattempt to provide a conceptual analysis of a different sort is found\nin Siipi 2008, while an account of naturalness linking this to\nhistorical narratives of place is given in O’Neill, Holland and Light\n2008, ch. 8 (compare the response to this in Siipi 2011).\n \nAs an alternative to consequentialism and deontology both of which\nconsider “thin” concepts such as “goodness”\nand “rightness” as essential to morality, virtue\nethics proposes to understand morality—and assess the\nethical quality of actions—in terms of “thick”\nconcepts such as “kindness”, “honesty”,\n“sincerity” and “justice”. As virtue ethics\nspeaks quite a different language from the other two kinds of ethical\ntheory, its theoretical focus is not so much on what kinds of things\nare good/bad, or what makes an action right/wrong.  Indeed, the\nrichness of the language of virtues, and the emphasis on moral\ncharacter, is sometimes cited as a reason for exploring a\nvirtues-based approach to the complex and always-changing questions of\nsustainability and environmental care (Hill 1983, Wensveen 2000,\nSandler 2007). One question central to virtue ethics is what the moral\nreasons are for acting one way or another. For instance, from the\nperspective of virtue ethics, kindness and loyalty would be moral\nreasons for helping a friend in hardship. These are quite different\nfrom the deontologist’s reason (that the action is demanded by a moral\nrule) or the consequentialist reason (that the action will lead to a\nbetter over-all balance of good over evil in the world). From the\nperspective of virtue ethics, the motivation and justification of\nactions are both inseparable from the character traits of the acting\nagent. Furthermore, unlike deontology or consequentialism the moral\nfocus of which is other people or states of the world, one central\nissue for virtue ethics is how to live a flourishing human life, this\nbeing a central concern of the moral agent himself or\nherself. “Living virtuously” is Aristotle’s recipe for\nflourishing. Versions of virtue ethics advocating virtues such as\n“benevolence”, “piety”,\n“filiality”, and “courage”, have also been\nheld by thinkers in the Chinese Confucian tradition. The connection\nbetween morality and psychology is another core subject of\ninvestigation for virtue ethics. It is sometimes suggested that human\nvirtues, which constitute an important aspect of a flourishing human\nlife, must be compatible with human needs and desires, and perhaps\nalso sensitive to individual affection and temperaments. As its\ncentral focus is human flourishing as such, virtue ethics may seem\nunavoidably anthropocentric and unable to support a genuine moral\nconcern for the non-human environment. But just as Aristotle has\nargued that a flourishing human life requires friendships and one can\nhave genuine friendships only if one genuinely values, loves,\nrespects, and cares for one’s friends for their own sake, not merely\nfor the benefits that they may bring to oneself, some have argued that\na flourishing human life requires the moral capacities to value, love,\nrespect, and care for the non-human natural world as an end in itself\n(see O’Neill 1992, O’Neill 1993, Barry 1999).  Despite the variety of positions in environmental ethics developed\nover the last thirty years, they have focused mainly on issues\nconcerned with wilderness and the reasons for its preservation (see\nCallicott and Nelson 1998 for a collection of essays on the ideas and\nmoral significance of wilderness). The importance of wilderness\nexperience to the human psyche has been emphasized by many\nenvironmental philosophers. Næss, for instance, urges us to\nensure we spend time dwelling in situations of intrinsic value,\nwhereas Rolston seeks “re-creation” of the human soul by\nmeditating in the wilderness. Likewise, the critical theorists believe\nthat aesthetic appreciation of nature has the power to re-enchant\nhuman life. As wilderness becomes increasingly rare, people’s exposure\nto wild things in their natural state has become reduced, and\naccording to some authors this may reduce the chance of our lives and\nother values being transformed as a result of interactions with\nnature.  An argument by Bryan Norton draws attention to an analogy\nwith music.  Someone exposed for the first time to a new musical genre\nmay undergo a transformation in musical preferences, tastes and values\nas a result of the experience (Norton 1987).  Such a transformation can\naffect their other preferences and desires too, in both direct and\nindirect ways (see Sarkar 2005, ch. 4, esp. pp. 82–7).  In the\nattempt to preserve opportunities for experiences that can change or\nenhance people’s valuations of nature, there has been a move since the\nearly 2000s to find ways of rewilding degraded environments, and even\nparts of cities (Fraser 2009, Monbiot 2013).(  By contrast to the focus on wild places, relatively little\nattention has been paid to the built environment, although this is the\none in which most people spend most of their time. In post-war\nBritain, for example, cheaply constructed new housing developments\nwere often poor replacements for traditional communities. They have\nbeen associated with lower amounts of social interaction and increased\ncrime compared with the earlier situation. The destruction of highly\nfunctional high-density traditional housing, indeed, might be compared\nwith the destruction of highly diverse ecosystems and biotic\ncommunities. Likewise, the loss of the world’s huge diversity of\nnatural languages has been mourned by many, not just professionals\nwith an interest in linguistics. Urban and linguistic environments are\njust two of the many “places” inhabited by humans. Some\nphilosophical theories about natural environments and objects have\npotential to be extended to cover built environments and non-natural\nobjects of several sorts (see King 2000, Light 2001, Palmer 2003,\nwhile Fox 2007 aims to include both built and natural environments in\nthe scope of a single ethical theory). Certainly there are many\nparallels between natural and artificial domains: for example, many of\nthe conceptual problems involved in discussing the restoration of\nnatural objects also appear in the parallel context of restoring\nhuman-made objects. \nThe focus on the value of wilderness and the importance of its\npreservation has overlooked another important problem—namely\nthat lifestyles in which enthusiasms for nature rambles, woodland\nmeditations or mountaineering can be indulged demand a standard of\nliving that is far beyond the dreams of most of the world’s\npopulation. Moreover, mass access to wild places would likely destroy\nthe very values held in high esteem by the “natural\naristocrats”, a term used by Hugh Stretton (1976) to\ncharacterize the environmentalists “driven chiefly by love of\nthe wilderness”. Thus, a new range of moral and political\nproblems open up, including the environmental cost of tourist access\nto wilderness areas, and ways in which limited access could be\narranged to areas of natural beauty and diversity, while maintaining\nthe individual freedoms central to liberal democracies.  Lovers of wilderness sometimes consider the high human populations\nin some developing countries as a key problem underlying the\nenvironmental crisis. Rolston (1996), for instance, claims that (some)\nhumans are a kind of planetary “cancer”. He maintains that\nwhile “feeding people always seems humane, ... when we face up\nto what is really going on, by just feeding people, without attention\nto the larger social results, we could be feeding a kind of\ncancer.” This remark is meant to justify the view that saving\nnature should, in some circumstances, have a higher priority than\nfeeding people. But such a view has been criticized for seeming to\nreveal a degree of misanthropy, directed at those human beings least\nable to protect and defend themselves (see Attfield 1998, Brennan\n1998a). The empirical basis of Rolston’s claims has been queried by\nwork showing that poor people are often extremely good environmental\nmanagers (Martinez-Alier 2002). Guha’s worries about the elitist and\n“missionary” tendencies of some kinds of deep green\nenvironmentalism in certain rich western countries can be quite\nreadily extended to theorists such as Rolston (Guha 1999). Can such an\napparently elitist sort of wilderness ethics ever be democratised? How\ncan the psychically-reviving power of the wild become available to\nthose living in the slums of Calcutta or São Paolo? These questions so\nfar lack convincing answers.  Furthermore, the economic conditions which support the kind of\nenjoyment of wilderness by Stretton’s “natural\naristocrats”, and more generally the lifestyles of many people\nin the affluent countries, seem implicated in the destruction and\npollution which has provoked the environmental turn in the first\nplace. For those in the richer countries, for instance, engaging in\noutdoor recreations usually involves the motor car. Car dependency,\nhowever, is at the heart of many environmental problems, a key factor\nin urban pollution, while at the same time central to the economic and\nmilitary activities of many nations and corporations, for example\nsecuring and exploiting oil reserves. In an increasingly crowded\nindustrialised world, the answers to such problems are pressing. Any\nadequate study of this intertwined set of problems must involve\ninterdisciplinary collaboration among philosophers and theorists in\nthe social as well as the natural sciences.  Connections between environmental destruction, unequal resource\nconsumption, poverty and the global economic order have been discussed\nby political scientists, development theorists, geographers and\neconomists as well as by philosophers. Links between economics and\nenvironmental ethics are particularly well established. Work by Mark\nSagoff (1988), for instance, has played a major part in bringing the\ntwo fields together. He argues that “as citizens rather than\nconsumers” people are concerned about values, which cannot\nplausibly be reduced to mere ordered preferences or quantified in\nmonetary terms.  Sagoff’s distinction between people as consumers and\npeople as citizens was intended to blunt the use of cost-benefit\nanalysis as the final arbiter in discussions about nature’s value.  Of\ncourse, spouses take out insurance on each others’ lives.  We pay\nextra for travel insurance to cover the cost of cancellation, illness,\nor lost baggage.  Such actions are economically rational.  They\nprovide us with some compensation in case of loss.  No-one, however,\nwould regard insurance payments as replacing lost limbs, a loved one\nor even the joys of a cancelled vacation. So it is for nature,\naccording to Sagoff.  We can put dollar values on a stand of timber, a\nreef, a beach, a national park.  We can measure the travel costs, the\nmoney spent by visitors, the real estate values, the park fees and all\nthe rest.  But these dollar measures do not tell us the value of\nnature any more than my insurance premiums tell you the value of a\nhuman life (also see Shrader-Frechette 1987, O’Neill 1993, and Brennan\n1995). If Sagoff is right, cost-benefit analysis of the kind mentioned\nin section 5 above cannot be a basis for an ethic of sustainability\nany more than for an ethic of biodiversity.  The potentially\nmisleading appeal to economic reason used to justify the expansion of\nthe corporate sector has also come under critical scrutiny by\nglobalisation theorists (see Korten 1999). These critiques do not aim\nto eliminate economics from environmental thinking; rather, they\nresist any reductive, and strongly anthropocentric, tendency to\nbelieve that all social and environmental problems are fundamentally\nor essentially economic. \nOther interdisciplinary approaches link environmental ethics with\nbiology, policy studies, public administration, political theory,\ncultural history, post-colonial theory, literature, geography, and\nhuman ecology (for some examples, see Norton, Hutchins, Stevens, Maple\n1995, Shrader-Frechette 1984, Gruen and Jamieson (eds.) 1994, Karliner\n1997, Diesendorf and Hamilton 1997, Schmidtz and Willott 2002). Many\nassessments of issues concerned with biodiversity, ecosystem health,\npoverty, environmental justice and sustainability look at both human\nand environmental issues, eschewing in the process commitment either\nto a purely anthropocentric or purely ecocentric perspective (see\nHayward and O’Neill 1997, and Dobson 1999 for collections of essays\nlooking at the links between sustainability, justice, welfare and the\ndistribution of environmental goods). The future development of\nenvironmental ethics depend on these, and other interdisciplinary\nsynergies, as much as on its anchorage within philosophy. \nThe Convention on Biological Diversity discussed in section 5 was\ninfluenced by\n Our Common Future,\n an earlier United Nations document on sustainability\nproduced by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED\n1987).  The commission was chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime\nMinister of Norway at the time, and the report is sometimes known as\nthe Brundtland Report.  This report noted the increasing tide of\nevidence that planetary systems vital to supporting life on Earth were\nunder strain.  The key question it raised is whether it is equitable\nto sacrifice options for future well-being in favour of supporting\ncurrent lifestyles, especially the comfortable, and sometimes lavish,\nforms of life enjoyed in the rich countries.  As Bryan Norton puts it,\nthe world faces a global challenge to see whether different human\ngroups, with widely varying perspectives, can perhaps “accept\nresponsibility to maintain a non-declining set of opportunities based\non possible uses of the environment”. The preservation of\noptions for the future can be readily linked to notions of equity if\nit is agreed that “the future ought not to face, as a result of\nour actions today, a seriously reduced range of options and choices,\nas they try to adapt to the environment that they face” (Norton\n2001: 97).  Note that references to “the future” need not\nbe limited to the future of human beings only. In keeping with the\nnon-anthropocentric focus of much environmental philosophy, a care for\nsustainability and biodiversity can embrace a care for opportunities\navailable to non-human living things. \nHowever, when the concept “sustainable development” was\nfirst articulated in the Brundtland Report, the emphasis was clearly\nanthropocentric. In face of increasing evidence that planetary systems\nvital to life-support were under strain, the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment is constructed in the report to encourage certain globally\ncoordinated directions and types of economic and social\ndevelopment. The report defines “sustainable development”\nin the following way: Sustainable development is development that meets the\nneeds of the present without compromising the ability of future\ngenerations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key\nconcepts: \nThus the goals of economic and social development must be defined in\nterms of sustainability in all countries—developed or\ndeveloping, market-oriented or centrally planned. Interpretations will\nvary, but must share certain general features and must flow from a\nconsensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a\nbroad strategic framework for achieving it. (WCED 1987, Ch. 2,\nparagraphs 1–2) \nThe report goes on to argue that “the industrial world has already\nused much of the planet’s ecological capital.  This inequality is the\nplanet’s main ‘environmental’ problem; it is also its main\n‘development’ problem” (WCED 1987, Overview, paragraph 17).  In the\nconcept of sustainable development the report combines the resource\neconomist’s notion of “sustainable yield” with the recognition that\ndeveloping countries of the world are entitled to economic growth and\nprosperity.  The notion of sustainable yield involves thinking of\nforests, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, including the natural\nspecies living in them, as a stock of “ecological capital” from which\nall kinds of goods and services flow.  Provided the flow of such goods\nand services does not reduce the capacity of the capital itself to\nmaintain its productivity, the use of the systems in question is\nregarded as sustainable.  Thus, the report argues that “maximum\nsustainable yield must be defined after taking into account\nsystem-wide effects of exploitation” of ecological capital (WCED 1987,\nCh. 2, paragraph 11). \nThere are clear philosophical, political and economic precursors to\nthe Brundtland concept of sustainability. For example, John Stuart\nMill (1848, IV. 6. 1) distinguished between the\n“stationary state” and\nthe “progressive state”\nand argued that at the end of the progressive state lies the\nstationary state, since “the increase of wealth\nis not boundless”. Mill also recognized a debt\nto the gloomy prognostications of Thomas Malthus,\n who had conjectured that population tends to increase\ngeometrically while food resources at best increase only\narithmetically, so that demand for food will inevitably outstrip the\nsupply (see Milgate and Stimson 2009, Ch. 7, and the discussion of\n Malthus in the Political Economy section of the entry on\n Mill\n  in the Spring 2016 Edition). Reflection on Malthus\nled Mill to argue for restraining human population growth: Such warnings resonate with more recent pessimism about increasing\nhuman population and its impact on the poorest people, as well as on\nloss of biodiversity, fresh water scarcity, overconsumption and\nclimate change.  In their controversial work The Population\nBomb, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, argue that without restrictions on\npopulation growth, including the imposition of mandatory birth\ncontrol, the world faced “mass starvation” in the short\nterm (Ehrlich 1968). In a subsequent defence of their early work, the\nEhrlichs declared that the most serious flaw in their original\nanalysis “was that it was much too optimistic about the\nfuture”, and comment that “Since The Bomb was written,\nincreases in greenhouse gas flows into the atmosphere, a consequence\nof the near doubling of the human population and the near tripling of\nglobal consumption, indicate that the results will likely be\ncatastrophic climate disruption caused by greenhouse heating”\n(Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2009, 66).  It was also in 1968 that Garrett\nHardin published his much cited article on the “tragedy of the\ncommons” showing that common resources are always subject to\ndegradation and extinction in the face of the rational pursuit of self\ninterest.  For Hardin, the increasing pressure on shared resources,\nand increasing pollution, are inevitable results of the fact that\n“there is no technical solution to the population problem”\n(Hardin 1968). The problem may be analysed from the perspective of the\nso-called\n prisoner’s dilemma\n (also see the\n free rider problem).\n Despite the pessimism of writers at the time, and the\nadvocacy of setting limits to population growth, there was also an\noptimism that echoes Mill’s own view that a “stationary\nstate” would not be one of misery and decline, but rather one in\nwhich humans could aspire to more equitable distribution of available\nand limited resources. This is clear not only among those who\nrecognize limits to economic growth (Meadows et al. 1972) but also\namong those who champion the move to a steady state economy (Daly\n1991) or at least want to see more account taken of ecology in\neconomics (Norgaard 1994). \nThe Brundtland report puts less emphasis on limits than do Mill,\nMalthus and these more recent writers. It depicts sustainability as a\nchallenge and opportunity for the world to become more socially,\npolitically and environmentally fair.  In pursuit of\n intergenerational justice,\n it suggests that there should be new\nhuman rights added to the standard list, for example, that “All human\nbeings have the fundamental right to an environment adequate for their\nhealth and well being” (WCED 1987, Annexe 1, paragraph 1). The report\nalso argues that “The enjoyment of any right requires respect for the\nsimilar rights of others, and recognition of reciprocal and even joint\nresponsibilities. States have a responsibility towards their own\ncitizens and other states” (ibid., chapter 12, paragraph 83).  Since\nthe report’s publication, many writers have supported and defended the\nview that global and\n economic justice\n require that nations which had become wealthy through\nearlier industrialization and environmental exploitation should allow\nless developed nations similar or equivalent opportunities for\ndevelopment especially in term of access to environmental resources\n(Redclift 2005).  As intended by the report the idea of sustainable\ndevelopment has become strongly integrated into the notion of\nenvironmental conservation.  The report has also set the scene for a\nrange of subsequent international conferences, declarations, and\nprotocols many of them maintaining the emphasis on the prospects for\nthe future of humanity, rather than considering sustainability in any\nwider sense.  Some early commentators on the notion of sustainable development\nhave been critical of the way the notion mixes together moral ideas of\njustice and fairness with technical ideas in economics.  The objection\nis that sustainability as, in part, an economic and scientific notion,\nshould not be fused with evaluative ideals (Beckerman 1994). This\nobjection has not generally been widely taken up. Mark Sagoff has\nobserved that environmental policy “is most characterized by the\nopposition between instrumental values and aesthetic and moral\njudgments and convictions” (Sagoff 2004: 20).  Some\nnon-anthropocentric environmental thinkers have found the language of\neconomics unsatisfactory in its implications since it already appears\nto assume a largely instrumental view of nature.  The use of notions\nsuch as “asset”, “capital” and even the word\n“resources” in connection with natural objects and systems\nhas been identified by some writers as instrumentalizing natural\nthings which are in essence wild and free.  The objection is that such\nlanguage promotes the tendency to think of natural things as mere\nresources for humans or as raw materials with which human labour could\nbe mixed, not only to produce consumable goods, but also to generate\nhuman ownership (Plumwood 1993, Sagoff 2004). If natural objects and\nsystems have intrinsic value independent of their possible use for\nhumans, as many environmental philosophers have argued, then a policy\napproach to sustainability needs to consider the environment and\nnatural things not only in instrumental and but also in intrinsic\nterms to do justice to the moral standing that many people believe\nsuch items possess. Despite its acknowledgment of there being\n“moral, ethical, cultural, aesthetic, and purely scientific\nreasons for conserving wild beings” (WCED 1987, Overview,\nparagraph 53), the strongly anthropocentric and instrumental language\nused throughout the Brundtland report in articulating the notion of\nsustainable development can be criticised for defining the notion too\nnarrowly, leaving little room for addressing sustainability questions\ndirectly concerning the Earth’s environment and its non-human\ninhabitants: should, and if so, how should, human beings reorganise\ntheir ways of life and the social-political structures of their\ncommunities to allow sustainability and equity not only for all humans\nbut also for the other species on the planet? \nThe preservation concern for nature and non-human species is addressed\nto some extent by making a distinction between weaker and stronger\nconceptions of sustainability (Beckerman 1995).  The distinction\nemerged from considering the question: what exactly does sustainable\ndevelopment seek to sustain?  Is it the flow of goods and services from\nworld markets that is to be maintained, or is it the current—or\nsome future—level of consumption?  In answering such questions,\nproponents of weak sustainability argue that it is acceptable to\nreplace natural capital with human-made capital provided that the\nlatter has equivalent functions.  If, for example, plastic trees could\nproduce oxygen, absorb carbon and support animal and insect\ncommunities, then they could replace the real thing, and a world with\nfunctionally equivalent artificial trees would seem just as good as\none with real or natural trees in it.  For weak sustainability\ntheorists, the aim of future development should be to maintain a\nconsistently productive stock of capital on which to draw, while not\ninsisting that some portion of that capital be natural. Strong\nsustainability theorists, by contrast, generally resist the\nsubstitution of human for natural capital, insisting that a critical\nstock of natural things and processes be preserved.  By so doing, they\nargue, we maintain stocks of rivers, forests and biodiverse systems,\nhence providing maximum options—options in terms of experience,\nappreciation, values, and ways of life—for the future human\ninhabitants of the planet (Norton 2005). The Brundtland report can\nalso be seen as advocating a form of strong sustainability in so far\nas it recommends that a “first priority is to establish the problem of\ndisappearing species and threatened ecosystems on political agendas as\na major resource issue” (ibid., chapter 6, paragraph 57). Furthermore,\ndespite its instrumental and economic language, the report in fact\nendorses a wider moral perspective on the status of and our relation\nto nature and non-human species, evidenced by its statement that “the\ncase for the conservation of nature should not rest only with\ndevelopment goals. It is part of our moral obligation to other living\nbeings and future generations” (WCED 1987, chapter 2, paragraph 55).\nImplicit in the statement is not only a strong conception of\nsustainability but also a non-anthropocentric conception of the\nnotion.  Over time, strong sustainability has come to be focused not\nonly on the needs of human and other living things but also on their\nrights (Redclift 2004, 218).  In a further development, the discourses\non forms of sustainability have generally given way in the last decade\nto a more ambiguous usage, in which the term “sustainability”\nfunctions to bring people into a debate rather than setting out a\nclear definition of the terms of the debate itself.  As globalization\nleads to greater integration of world economies, the world after the\nBrundtland report has seen greater fragmentation among viewpoints,\nwhere critics of globalization have generally used the concept of\nsustainability in a plurality of different ways (Sneddon, Howarth and\nNorgaard 2006).  Some have argued that “sustainability”, just like the\nword “nature” itself, has come to mean very different things, carrying\ndifferent symbolic meaning for different groups, and reflecting very\ndifferent interests (Redclift 2004, 220).  For better or for worse,\nsuch ambiguity can on occasion allow different parties in negotiations\nto claim a measure of agreement. \nThe preservation of opportunities to live well, or at least to have a\nminimally acceptable level of well being, is at the heart of\n population ethics\n and many contemporary conceptions of\nsustainability. Many people believe such opportunities for the\nexisting younger generations, and also for the yet to arrive future\ngenerations, to be under threat from continuing environmental\ndestruction, including loss of fresh water resources, continued\nclearing of wild areas and a changing climate.  Of these, climate\nchange has come to prominence as an area of intense policy and\npolitical debate, to which applied philosophers and ethicists have\nmuch to contribute.  An early exploration of the topic by John Broome\nshows how the economics of climate change could not be divorced from\nconsiderations of intergenerational justice and ethics (Broome 1992),\nand this has set the scene for subsequent discussions and\nanalyses. More than a decade later, when Stephen Gardiner analyses the\nstate of affairs surrounding climate change in an article entitled “A\nPerfect Moral Storm” (Gardiner 2006), his starting point is also that\nethics plays a fundamental role in all discussions of climate\npolicy. But he argues that even if difficult ethical and conceptual\nquestions facing climate change (such as the so-called\n “non-identity problem”\nalong with the notion of\n historic injustices)\n could be answered, it would still be close to\npolitically and socially impossible to formulate, let alone to\nenforce, policies and action plans to deal effectively with climate\nchange. This is due to the multi-faceted nature of a problem that\ninvolves vast numbers of agents and players.  At a global level, there\nis first of all the practical problem of motivating shared\nresponsibilities (see the entry on \n moral motivation) \nin part due to the dispersed nature of greenhouse gas\nemissions which makes the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric\ncarbon and methane not always felt most strongly in the regions where\nthey originate. Add to this the fact that there is an un-coordinated\nand also dispersed network of agents—both individual and \ncorporate—responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and that there are no\neffective institutions that can control and limit them.  But this\ntangle of issues constitutes, Gardiner argues, only one strand in the\nskein of quandaries that confronts us.  There is also the fact that by\nand large only future generations will carry the brunt of the impacts\nof climate change, explaining why current generations have no strong\nincentive to act.  Finally, it is evident that our current mainstream\npolitical, economic, and ethical models are not up to the task of\nreaching global consensus, and in many cases not even national\nconsensus, on how best to design and implement fair climate\npolicies.   These considerations lead Gardiner to take a pessimistic view of\nthe prospects for progress on climate issues.  His view includes\npessimism about technical solutions, such as geoengineering as the\nantidote to climate problems, echoing the concerns of others that\nfurther domination of and large scale interventions in nature may turn\nout to be a greater evil than enduring a climate catastrophe (Gardiner\n2011, ch 11, Jamieson 1996). A key point in Gardiner’s analysis\nis that the problem of climate change involves a tangle of issues, the\ncomplexity of which conspires to encourage buck-passing, weakness of\nwill, distraction and procrastination , “mak[ing] us extremely\nvulnerable to moral corruption” (ibid., 397; cf. Gardiner 2011;\nalso see the concept of “wicked problem” in Brennan\n2004). Because of the grave risk of serious harms to future\ngenerations, our failure to take timely mitigating actions on climate\nisseus can be seen as a serious moral failing, especially in the light\nof our current knowledge and understanding of the problem. Summarizing\nwidespread frustration over the issue, Rolston writes: “All this\ninability to act effectively in the political arena casts a long\nshadow of doubt on whether, politically or technologically, much less\nethically, we humans are anywhere near being smart enough to manage\nthe planet” (Rolston 2012, 216).  In the face of such pessimism\nabout the prospects for securing any action to combat climate change\nother writers have cautioned against giving in to defeatism and making\nself-fulfilling prophecies. These latter behaviours are always a\ntemptation when we confront worrying truths and insufficient\nanswers. Whatever the future holds, many thinkers now believe that\nsolving the problems of climate change is an essential ingredient in\nany credible form of sustainable development and that the alternative\nto decisive action may result in the diminution not only of nature and\nnatural systems, but also of human dignity itself (see Nanda 2011,\nespecially chapters by Heyd, Balafrej, Gutrich and Brennan and\nLo).","contact.mail":"A.Brennan@latrobe.edu.au","contact.domain":"latrobe.edu.au"},{"date.published":"2002-06-03","date.changed":"2015-07-21","url":"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-environmental/","author1":"Andrew Brennan","author1.info":"http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/about/staff/profile?uname=ABrennan","author2.info":"https://norvalo.weebly.com/","entry":"ethics-environmental","body.text":"\n\n\nEnvironmental ethics is the discipline in philosophy that studies the\nmoral relationship of human beings to, and also the value and moral\nstatus of, the environment and its non-human contents. This entry\ncovers: (1) the challenge of environmental ethics to the\nanthropocentrism (i.e., human-centeredness) embedded in traditional\nwestern ethical thinking; (2) the early development of the discipline\nin the 1960s and 1970s; (3) the connection of deep ecology, feminist\nenvironmental ethics, animism and social ecology to politics; (4) the\nattempt to apply traditional ethical theories, including\nconsequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, to support\ncontemporary environmental concerns; (5) the preservation of\nbiodiversity as an ethical goal; (6) the broader concerns of some\nthinkers with wilderness, the built environment and the politics of\npoverty; (7) the ethics of sustainability and climate change, and (8)\nsome directions for possible future developments of the\ndiscipline. \n\n\nSuppose putting out natural fires, culling feral animals or\ndestroying some individual members of overpopulated indigenous species\nis necessary for the protection of the integrity of a certain\necosystem. Will these actions be morally permissible or even required?\nIs it morally acceptable for farmers in non-industrial countries to\npractise slash and burn techniques to clear areas for agriculture?\nConsider a mining company which has performed open pit mining in some\npreviously unspoiled area. Does the company have a moral obligation to\nrestore the landform and surface ecology? And what is the value of a\nhumanly restored environment compared with the originally natural\nenvironment? It is often said to be morally wrong for human beings to\npollute and destroy parts of the natural environment and to consume a\nhuge proportion of the planet’s natural resources. If that is wrong,\nis it simply because a sustainable environment is essential to\n(present and future) human well-being? Or is such behaviour also wrong\nbecause the natural environment and/or its various contents have\ncertain values in their own right so that these values ought to be\nrespected and protected in any case? These are among the questions\ninvestigated by environmental ethics. Some of them are specific\nquestions faced by individuals in particular circumstances, while\nothers are more global questions faced by groups and communities. Yet\nothers are more abstract questions concerning the value and moral\nstanding of the natural environment and its non-human components. \nIn the literature on environmental ethics the distinction between\ninstrumental value and\n intrinsic value\n(in the sense of “non-instrumental value”) has been of\nconsiderable importance. The former is the value of things as\nmeans to further some other ends, whereas the latter is the\nvalue of things as ends in themselves regardless of whether\nthey are also useful as means to other ends. For instance, certain\nfruits have instrumental value for bats who feed on them, since\nfeeding on the fruits is a means to survival for the bats. However, it\nis not widely agreed that fruits have value as ends in themselves. We\ncan likewise think of a person who teaches others as having\ninstrumental value for those who want to acquire knowledge. Yet, in\naddition to any such value, it is normally said that a person, as a\nperson, has intrinsic value, i.e., value in his or her own right\nindependently of his or her prospects for serving the ends of\nothers. For another example, a certain wild plant may have\ninstrumental value because it provides the ingredients for some\nmedicine or as an aesthetic object for human observers. But if the\nplant also has some value in itself independently of its prospects for\nfurthering some other ends such as human health, or the pleasure from\naesthetic experience, then the plant also has intrinsic value. Because\nthe intrinsically valuable is that which is good as an end in itself,\nit is commonly agreed that something’s possession of intrinsic value\ngenerates a prima facie direct moral duty on the part of moral agents\nto protect it or at least refrain from damaging it (see O’Neil 1992\nand Jamieson 2002 for detailed accounts of intrinsic value). \nMany traditional western ethical perspectives, however, are\nanthropocentric or human-centered in that either they assign\nintrinsic value to human beings alone (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a strong sense) or they assign a\nsignificantly greater amount of intrinsic value to human beings than\nto any non-human things such that the protection or promotion of human\ninterests or well-being at the expense of non-human things turns out\nto be nearly always justified (i.e., what we might call\nanthropocentric in a weak sense). For example, Aristotle\n(Politics, Bk. 1, Ch. 8) maintains that “nature has\nmade all things specifically for the sake of man” and that the\nvalue of non-human things in nature is merely instrumental. Generally,\nanthropocentric positions find it problematic to articulate what is\nwrong with the cruel treatment of non-human animals, except to the\nextent that such treatment may lead to bad consequences for human\nbeings. Immanuel Kant (“Duties to Animals and Spirits”, in\nLectures on Ethics), for instance, suggests that cruelty\ntowards a dog might encourage a person to develop a character which\nwould be desensitized to cruelty towards humans. From this standpoint,\ncruelty towards non-human animals would be instrumentally, rather than\nintrinsically, wrong. Likewise, anthropocentrism often recognizes some\nnon-intrinsic wrongness of anthropogenic (i.e. human-caused)\nenvironmental devastation. Such destruction might damage the\nwell-being of human beings now and in the future, since our well-being\nis essentially dependent on a sustainable environment (see Passmore\n1974; Bookchin 1990; Norton et al. (eds.) 1995). \nWhen environmental ethics emerged as a new sub-discipline of\nphilosophy in the early 1970s, it did so by posing a challenge to\ntraditional anthropocentrism. In the first place, it questioned the\nassumed moral superiority of human beings to members of other species\non Earth. In the second place, it investigated the possibility of\nrational arguments for assigning intrinsic value to the natural\nenvironment and its non-human contents. It should be noted, however,\nthat some theorists working in the field see no need to develop new,\nnon-anthropocentric theories. Instead, they advocate what may be\ncalled enlightened anthropocentrism (or, perhaps more\nappropriately called, prudential anthropocentrism). Briefly,\nthis is the view that all the moral duties we have towards the\nenvironment are derived from our direct duties to its human\ninhabitants. The practical purpose of environmental ethics, they\nmaintain, is to provide moral grounds for social policies aimed at\nprotecting the Earth’s environment and remedying environmental\ndegradation. Enlightened anthropocentrism, they argue, is sufficient\nfor that practical purpose, and perhaps even more effective in\ndelivering pragmatic outcomes, in terms of policy-making, than\nnon-anthropocentric theories given the theoretical burden on the\nlatter to provide sound arguments for its more radical view that the\nnon-human environment has intrinsic value (cf. Norton 1991, de Shalit\n1994, Light and Katz 1996). Furthermore, some prudential\nanthropocentrists may hold what might be called cynical\nanthropocentrism, which says that we have a higher-level\nanthropocentric reason to be non-anthropocentric in our day-to-day\nthinking. Suppose that a day-to-day non-anthropocentrist tends to act\nmore benignly towards the non-human environment on which human\nwell-being depends. This would provide reason for encouraging\nnon-anthropocentric thinking, even to those who find the idea of\nnon-anthropocentric intrinsic value hard to swallow. In order for such\na strategy to be effective one may need to hide one’s cynical\nanthropocentrism from others and even from oneself. The position can\nbe structurally compared to some indirect form of\n consequentialism\n and may attract parallel critiques (see\n Henry Sidgwick\non utilitarianism and esoteric morality, and\n Bernard Williams\n on indirect utilitarianism). \nAlthough nature was the focus of much nineteenth and twentieth century\nphilosophy, contemporary environmental ethics only emerged as an\nacademic discipline in the 1970s. The questioning and rethinking of\nthe relationship of human beings with the natural environment over the\nlast thirty years reflected an already widespread perception in the\n1960s that the late twentieth century faced a human population\nexplosion as well as a serious environmental crisis. Among the\naccessible work that drew attention to a sense of crisis was Rachel\nCarson’s Silent Spring (1963), which consisted of a number of\nessays earlier published in the New Yorker magazine detailing\nhow pesticides such as DDT, aldrin and deildrin concentrated through\nthe food web. Commercial farming practices aimed at maximizing crop\nyields and profits, Carson speculates, are capable of impacting\nsimultaneously on environmental and public health. \nIn a much cited essay (White 1967) on the historical roots of the\nenvironmental crisis, historian Lynn White argued that the main\nstrands of Judeo-Christian thinking had encouraged the\noverexploitation of nature by maintaining the superiority of humans\nover all other forms of life on Earth, and by depicting all of nature\nas created for the use of humans. White’s thesis was widely discussed\nin theology, history, and has been subject to some sociological\ntesting as well as being regularly discussed by philosophers (see\nWhitney 1993, Attfield 2001). Central to the rationale for his thesis\nwere the works of the Church Fathers and The Bible itself, supporting\nthe anthropocentric perspective that humans are the only things that\nmatter on Earth. Consequently, they may utilize and consume everything\nelse to their advantage without any injustice. For example,\nGenesis 1: 27–8 states: “God created man in his own\nimage, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he\nthem. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and\nmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion\nover fish of the sea, and over fowl of the air, and over every living\nthing that moveth upon the earth.” Likewise, Thomas Aquinas\n(Summa Contra Gentiles, Bk. 3, Pt 2, Ch 112) argued that\nnon-human animals are “ordered to man’s use”. According to\nWhite, the Judeo-Christian idea that humans are created in the image\nof the transcendent supernatural God, who is radically separate from\nnature, also by extension radically separates humans themselves from\nnature. This ideology further opened the way for untrammeled\nexploitation of nature. Modern Western science itself, White argued,\nwas “cast in the matrix of Christian theology” so that it\ntoo inherited the “orthodox Christian arrogance toward\nnature” (White 1967: 1207). Clearly, without technology and\nscience, the environmental extremes to which we are now exposed would\nprobably not be realized. The point of White’s thesis, however, is\nthat given the modern form of science and technology,\nJudeo-Christianity itself provides the original deep-seated drive to\nunlimited exploitation of nature. Nevertheless, White argued that some\nminority traditions within Christianity (e.g., the views of\nSt. Francis) might provide an antidote to the “arrogance”\nof a mainstream tradition steeped in anthropocentrism. \nAround the same time, the Stanford ecologists Paul and Anne Ehrlich\nwarned in The Population Bomb (Ehrlich 1968) that the growth\nof human population threatened the viability of planetary life-support\nsystems. The sense of environmental crisis stimulated by those and\nother popular works was intensified by NASA’s production and wide\ndissemination of a particularly potent image of Earth from space taken\nat Christmas 1968 and featured in the Scientific American in\nSeptember 1970. Here, plain to see, was a living, shining planet\nvoyaging through space and shared by all of humanity, a precious\nvessel vulnerable to pollution and to the overuse of its limited\ncapacities. In 1972 a team of researchers at MIT led by Dennis Meadows\npublished the Limits to Growth study, a work that summed up\nin many ways the emerging concerns of the previous decade and the\nsense of vulnerability triggered by the view of the Earth from\nspace. In the commentary to the study, the researchers wrote:  The call for a “basic change of values” in connection\nto the environment (a call that could be interpreted in terms of\neither instrumental or intrinsic values) reflected a need for the\ndevelopment of environmental ethics as a new sub-discipline of\nphilosophy. \nThe new field emerged almost simultaneously in three countries—the\nUnited States, Australia, and Norway. In the first two of these\ncountries, direction and inspiration largely came from the earlier\ntwentieth century American literature of the environment. For\ninstance, the Scottish emigrant John Muir (founder of the Sierra Club\nand “father of American conservation”) and subsequently the\nforester Aldo Leopold had advocated an appreciation and conservation\nof things “natural, wild and free”. Their concerns were\nmotivated by a combination of ethical and aesthetic responses to\nnature as well as a rejection of crudely economic approaches to the\nvalue of natural objects (a historical survey of the confrontation\nbetween Muir’s reverentialism and the human-centred conservationism of\nGifford Pinchot (one of the major influences on the development of the\nUS Forest Service) is provided in Norton 1991; also see Cohen 1984 and\nNash (ed) 1990). Leopold’s A Sand County Almanac (1949), in\nparticular, advocated the adoption of a “land ethic”: \nA thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability,\nand beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends\notherwise. (Leopold 1949: 224–5) \nHowever, Leopold himself provided no systematic ethical theory or\nframework to support these ethical ideas concerning the\nenvironment. His views therefore presented a challenge and opportunity\nfor moral theorists: could some ethical theory be devised to justify\nthe injunction to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the\nbiosphere?  The land ethic sketched by Leopold, attempting to extend our moral\nconcern to cover the natural environment and its non-human contents,\nwas drawn on explicitly by the Australian philosopher Richard Routley\n(later Sylvan). According to Routley (1973 (cf. Routley and Routley\n1980)), the anthropocentrism imbedded in what he called the\n“dominant western view”, or “the western\nsuperethic”, is in effect “human chauvinism”. This\nview, he argued, is just another form of class chauvinism, which is\nsimply based on blind class “loyalty” or prejudice, and\nunjustifiably discriminates against those outside the privileged\nclass. Echoing the plot of a popular movie some three years earlier\n(see Lo and Brennan 2013), Routley speculates in his “last\nman” (and “last people”) arguments about a\nhypothetical situation in which the last person, surviving a world\ncatastrophe, acts to ensure the elimination of all other living things\nand the last people set about destroying forests and ecosystems after\ntheir demise. From the human-chauvinistic (or absolutely\nanthropocentric) perspective, the last person would do nothing morally\nwrong, since his or her destructive act in question would not cause\nany damage to the interest and well-being of humans, who would by then\nhave disappeared. Nevertheless, Routley points out that there is a\nmoral intuition that the imagined last acts would be morally wrong. An\nexplanation for this judgment, he argued, is that those non-human\nobjects in the environment, whose destruction is ensured by the last\nperson or last people, have intrinsic value, a kind of value\nindependent of their usefulness for humans. From his critique, Routley\nconcluded that the main approaches in traditional western moral\nthinking were unable to allow the recognition that natural things have\nintrinsic value, and that the tradition required overhaul of a\nsignificant kind.  Leopold’s idea that the “land” as a whole is an object\nof our moral concern also stimulated writers to argue for certain\nmoral obligations toward ecological wholes, such as species,\ncommunities, and ecosystems, not just their individual\nconstituents. The U.S.-based theologian and environmental philosopher\nHolmes Rolston III, for instance, argued that species protection was a\nmoral duty (Rolston 1975). It would be wrong, he maintained, to\neliminate a rare butterfly species simply to increase the monetary\nvalue of specimens already held by collectors. Like Routley’s\n“last man” arguments, Rolston’s example is meant to draw\nattention to a kind of action that seems morally dubious and yet is\nnot clearly ruled out or condemned by traditional anthropocentric\nethical views. Species, Rolston went on to argue, are intrinsically\nvaluable and are usually more valuable than individual specimens,\nsince the loss of a species is a loss of genetic possibilities and the\ndeliberate destruction of a species would show disrespect for the very\nbiological processes which make possible the emergence of individual\nliving things (also see Rolston 1989, Ch 10). Natural processes\ndeserve respect, according to Rolston’s quasi-religious perspective,\nbecause they constitute a nature (or God) which is itself\nintrinsically valuable (or sacred). \n Meanwhile, the work of Christopher Stone (a professor of law at the\nUniversity of Southern California) had become widely discussed. Stone\n(1972) proposed that trees and other natural objects should have at\nleast the same standing in law as corporations. This suggestion was\ninspired by a particular case in which the Sierra Club had mounted a\nchallenge against the permit granted by the U.S. Forest Service to\nWalt Disney Enterprises for surveys preparatory to the development of\nthe Mineral King Valley, which was at the time a relatively remote\ngame refuge, but not designated as a national park or protected\nwilderness area. The Disney proposal was to develop a major resort\ncomplex serving 14000 visitors daily to be accessed by a purpose-built\nhighway through Sequoia National Park. The Sierra Club, as a body with\na general concern for wilderness conservation, challenged the\ndevelopment on the grounds that the valley should be kept in its\noriginal state for its own sake. \n Stone reasoned that if trees, forests and mountains could be given\nstanding in law then they could be represented in their own right in\nthe courts by groups such as the Sierra Club. Moreover, like any other\nlegal person, these natural things could become beneficiaries\nof compensation if it could be shown that they had suffered\ncompensatable injury through human activity. When the case went to the\nU.S. Supreme Court, it was determined by a narrow majority that the\nSierra Club did not meet the condition for bringing a case to court,\nfor the Club was unable and unwilling to prove the likelihood of\ninjury to the interest of the Club or its members. In a dissenting\nminority judgment, however, justices Douglas, Blackmun and Brennan\nmentioned Stone’s argument: his proposal to give legal standing to\nnatural things, they said, would allow conservation interests,\ncommunity needs and business interests to be represented, debated and\nsettled in court. \nReacting to Stone’s proposal, Joel Feinberg (1974) raised a serious\nproblem. Only items that have interests, Feinberg argued, can be\nregarded as having legal standing and, likewise, moral standing. For\nit is interests which are capable of being represented in legal\nproceedings and moral debates. This same point would also seem to\napply to political debates. For instance, the movement for\n“animal liberation”, which also emerged strongly in the\n1970s, can be thought of as a political movement aimed at representing\nthe previously neglected interests of some animals (see Regan and\nSinger (eds.) 1976, Clark 1977, and also the entry on\n the moral status of animals). Granted that\nsome animals have interests that can be represented in this way, would\nit also make sense to speak of trees, forests, rivers, barnacles, or\ntermites as having interests of a morally relevant kind?  This issue\nwas hotly contested in the years that followed. Meanwhile, John\nPassmore (1974) argued, like White, that the Judeo-Christian tradition\nof thought about nature, despite being predominantly\n“despotic”, contained resources for regarding humans as\n“stewards” or “perfectors” of God’s\ncreation. Skeptical of the prospects for any radically new ethic,\nPassmore cautioned that traditions of thought could not be abruptly\noverhauled. Any change in attitudes to our natural surroundings which\nstood the chance of widespread acceptance, he argued, would have to\nresonate and have some continuities with the very tradition which had\nlegitimized our destructive practices. In sum, then, Leopold’s land\nethic, the historical analyses of White and Passmore, the pioneering\nwork of Routley, Stone and Rolston, and the warnings of scientists,\nhad by the late 1970s focused the attention of philosophers and\npolitical theorists firmly on the environment.  The confluence of ethical, political and legal debates about the\nenvironment, the emergence of philosophies to underpin animal rights\nactivism and the puzzles over whether an environmental ethic would be\nsomething new rather than a modification or extension of existing\nethical theories were reflected in wider social and political\nmovements. The rise of environmental or “green” parties in\nEurope in the 1980s was accompanied by almost immediate schisms\nbetween groups known as “realists” versus\n“fundamentalists” (see Dobson 1990). The\n“realists” stood for reform environmentalism, working with\nbusiness and government to soften the impact of pollution and resource\ndepletion especially on fragile ecosystems or endangered species. The\n“fundies” argued for radical change, the setting of\nstringent new priorities, and even the overthrow of capitalism and\nliberal individualism, which were taken as the major ideological\ncauses of anthropogenic environmental devastation. It is not clear,\nhowever, that collectivist or communist countries do any better in\nterms of their environmental record (see Dominick 1998).  Underlying these political disagreements was the distinction\nbetween “shallow” and “deep” environmental\nmovements, a distinction introduced in the early 1970s by another\nmajor influence on contemporary environmental ethics, the Norwegian\nphilosopher and climber Arne Næss. Since the work of Næss\nhas been significant in environmental politics, the discussion of his\nposition is given in a separate section below. \n“Deep ecology” was born in Scandinavia, the result of\ndiscussions between Næss and his colleagues Sigmund\nKvaløy and Nils Faarlund (see Næss 1973 and 1989; also\nsee Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999 for a historical survey and\ncommentary on the development of deep ecology). All three shared a\npassion for the great mountains. On a visit to the Himalayas, they\nbecame impressed with aspects of “Sherpa culture”\nparticularly when they found that their Sherpa guides regarded certain\nmountains as sacred and accordingly would not venture onto\nthem. Subsequently, Næss formulated a position which extended\nthe reverence the three Norwegians and the Sherpas felt for mountains\nto other natural things in general. \nThe “shallow ecology movement”, as Næss (1973) calls it,\nis the “fight against pollution and resource depletion”, the\ncentral objective of which is “the health and affluence of people\nin the developed countries.” The “deep ecology\nmovement”, in contrast, endorses “biospheric\negalitarianism”, the view that all living things are alike in\nhaving value in their own right, independent of their usefulness to\nothers. The deep ecologist respects this intrinsic value, taking care,\nfor example, when walking on the mountainside not to cause unnecessary\ndamage to the plants. \nInspired by Spinoza’s metaphysics, another key feature of Næss’s\ndeep ecology is the rejection of atomistic individualism. The idea\nthat a human being is such an individual possessing a separate\nessence, Næss argues, radically separates the human self from the\nrest of the world. To make such a separation not only leads to\nselfishness towards other people, but also induces human selfishness\ntowards nature. As a counter to egoism at both the individual and\nspecies level, Næss proposes the adoption of an alternative\nrelational “total-field image” of the\nworld. According to this relationalism, organisms (human or otherwise)\nare best understood as “knots” in the biospherical net. The\nidentity of a living thing is essentially constituted by its relations\nto other things in the world, especially its ecological relations to\nother living things. If people conceptualise themselves and the world\nin relational terms, the deep ecologists argue, then people will take\nbetter care of nature and the world in general. \nAs developed by Næss and others, the position also came to focus\non the possibility of the identification of the human ego\nwith nature. The idea is, briefly, that by identifying with nature I\ncan enlarge the boundaries of the self beyond my skin. My \nlarger—ecological—Self (the capital “S” emphasizes that I am\nsomething larger than my body and consciousness), deserves respect as\nwell. To respect and to care for my Self is also to respect and to\ncare for the natural environment, which is actually part of me and\nwith which I should identify. “Self-realization”, in other\nwords, is the reconnection of the shriveled human individual with the\nwider natural environment. Næss maintains that the deep\nsatisfaction that we receive from identification with nature and close\npartnership with other forms of life in nature contributes\nsignificantly to our life quality. (One clear historical antecedent to\nthis kind of nature spiritualism is the romanticism of Jean-Jacques\nRousseau as expressed in his last work, the Reveries of the\nSolitary Walker)  When Næss’s view crossed the Atlantic, it was sometimes\nmerged with ideas emerging from Leopold’s land ethic (see Devall and\nSessions 1985; also see Sessions (ed) 1995). But \nNæss—wary of the apparent totalitarian \npolitical implications of Leopold’s\nposition that individual interests and well-being should be\nsubordinated to the holistic good of the Earth’s biotic community (see\nsection 4 below)—has always taken care to distance himself\nfrom advocating any sort of “land ethic”. (See Anker 1999\nfor cautions on interpreting Næss’s relationalism as an\nendorsement of the kind of holism displayed in the land ethic;\ncf. Grey 1993, Taylor and Zimmerman 2005). Some critics have argued\nthat Næss’s deep ecology is no more than an extended\nsocial-democratic version of utilitarianism, which counts human\ninterests in the same calculation alongside the interests of all\nnatural things (e.g., trees, wolves, bears, rivers, forests and\nmountains) in the natural environment (see Witoszek 1997). However,\nNæss failed to explain in any detail how to make sense of the\nidea that oysters or barnacles, termites or bacteria could have\ninterests of any morally relevant sort at all. Without an account of\nthis, Næss’s early “biospheric egalitarianism”—that \nall living things whatsoever had a similar right to live\nand flourish—was an indeterminate principle in practical\nterms. It also remains unclear in what sense rivers, mountains and\nforests can be regarded as possessors of any kind of interests. This\nis an issue on which Næss always remained elusive. \nBiospheric egalitarianism was modified in the 1980s to the weaker\nclaim that the flourishing of both human and non-human life have value\nin themselves. At the same time, Næss declared that his own\nfavoured ecological philosophy—“Ecosophy T”, as he called\nit after his Tvergastein mountain cabin—was only one of several\npossible foundations for an environmental ethic. Deep ecology ceased\nto be a specific doctrine, but instead became a “platform”,\nof eight simple points, on which Næss hoped all deep green thinkers\ncould agree. The platform was conceived as establishing a middle\nground, between underlying philosophical orientations, whether\nChristian, Buddhist, Daoist, process philosophy, or whatever, and the\npractical principles for action in specific situations, principles\ngenerated from the underlying philosophies. Thus the deep ecological\nmovement became explicitly pluralist (see Brennan 1999; c.f. Light\n1996). \nWhile Næss’s Ecosophy T sees human Self-realization as a solution\nto the environmental crises resulting from human selfishness and\nexploitation of nature, some of the followers of the deep ecology\nplatform in the United States and Australia further argue that the\nexpansion of the human self to include non-human nature is supported by\nthe Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, which is said to have\ndissolved the boundaries between the observer and the observed (see\nFox 1984, 1990, and Devall and Sessions 1985; cf. Callicott\n1985). These \"relationalist\" developments of deep ecology are,\nhowever, criticized by some feminist theorists. The idea of nature as\npart of oneself, one might argue, could justify the continued\nexploitation of nature instead. For one is presumably more entitled to\ntreat oneself in whatever ways one likes than to treat another\nindependent agent in whatever ways one likes. According to some\nfeminist critics, the deep ecological theory of the “expanded\nself” is in effect a disguised form of human colonialism, unable\nto give nature its due as a genuine “other” independent of\nhuman interest and purposes (see Plumwood 1993, Ch. 7, 1999, and\nWarren 1999).  \nMeanwhile, some third-world critics accused deep ecology of\nbeing elitist in its attempts to preserve wilderness experiences for\nonly a select group of economically and socio-politically well-off\npeople. The Indian writer Ramachandra Guha (1989, 1999) for instance,\ndepicts the activities of many western-based conservation groups as a\nnew form of cultural imperialism, aimed at securing converts to\nconservationism (cf. Bookchin 1987 and Brennan 1998a). “Green\nmissionaries”, as Guha calls them, represent a movement aimed at\nfurther dispossessing the world’s poor and indigenous\npeople. “Putting deep ecology in its place,” he writes,\n“is to recognize that the trends it derides as\n“shallow” ecology might in fact be varieties of\nenvironmentalism that are more apposite, more representative and more\npopular in the countries of the South.” Although Næss himself\nrepudiates suggestions that deep ecology is committed to any\nimperialism (see Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999, Ch. 36–7 and 41),\nGuha’s criticism raises important questions about the application of\ndeep ecological principles in different social, economic and cultural\ncontexts. Finally, in other critiques, deep ecology is portrayed as\nhaving an inconsistent utopian vision (see Anker and Witoszek\n1998). \nBroadly speaking, a feminist issue is any that contributes in some\nway to understanding the oppression of women. Feminist theories\nattempt to analyze women’s oppression, its causes and consequences,\nand suggest strategies and directions for women’s liberation. By the\nmid 1970s, feminist writers had raised the issue of whether\npatriarchal modes of thinking encouraged not only widespread\ninferiorizing and colonizing of women, but also of people of colour,\nanimals and nature. Sheila Collins (1974), for instance, argued that\nmale-dominated culture or patriarchy is supported by four interlocking\npillars: sexism, racism, class exploitation, and ecological\ndestruction. \nEmphasizing the importance of feminism to the environmental movement\nand various other liberation movements, some writers, such as Ynestra\nKing (1989a and 1989b), argue that the domination of women by men is\nhistorically the original form of domination in human society, from\nwhich all other hierarchies—of rank, class, and political\npower—flow. For instance, human exploitation of nature may be\nseen as a manifestation and extension of the oppression of women, in\nthat it is the result of associating nature with the female, which had\nbeen already inferiorized and oppressed by the male-dominating\nculture. But within the plurality of feminist positions, other\nwriters, such as Val Plumwood (1993), understand the oppression of\nwomen as only one of the many parallel forms of oppression sharing and\nsupported by a common ideological structure, in which one party (the\ncolonizer) uses a number of conceptual and rhetorical devices to\nprivilege its interests over that of the other party (the\ncolonized). Facilitated by a common structure, seemingly diverse forms\nof oppression can mutually reinforce each other (Warren 1987, 1990,\n1994, Cheney 1989, and Plumwood 1993). \nNot all feminist theorists would call that common underlying\noppressive structure “androcentric” or\n“patriarchal”. But it is generally agreed that core features\nof the structure include “dualism”, hierarchical thinking,\nand the “logic of domination”, which are typical of, if not\nessential to, male-chauvinism. These patterns of thinking and\nconceptualizing the world, many feminist theorists argue, also nourish\nand sustain other forms of chauvinism, including, human-chauvinism\n(i.e., anthropocentrism), which is responsible for much human\nexploitation of, and destructiveness towards, nature. The dualistic\nway of thinking, for instance, sees the world in polar opposite terms,\nsuch as male/female, masculinity/femininity, reason/emotion,\nfreedom/necessity, active/passive, mind/body, pure/soiled,\nwhite/coloured, civilized/primitive, transcendent/immanent,\nhuman/animal, culture/nature. Furthermore, under dualism all the first\nitems in these contrasting pairs are assimilated with each other, and\nall the second items are likewise linked with each other. For example,\nthe male is seen to be associated with the rational, active, creative,\nCartesian human mind, and civilized, orderly, transcendent culture;\nwhereas the female is regarded as tied to the emotional, passive,\ndetermined animal body, and primitive, disorderly, immanent\nnature. These interlocking dualisms are not just descriptive\ndichotomies, according to the feminists, but involve a prescriptive\nprivileging of one side of the opposed items over the other. Dualism\nconfers superiority to everything on the male side, but inferiority to\neverything on the female side. The “logic of domination”\nthen dictates that those on the superior side (e.g., men, rational\nbeings, humans) are morally entitled to dominate and utilize those on\nthe inferior side (e.g., women, beings lacking in rationality,\nnon-humans) as mere means. \nThe problem with dualistic and hierarchical modes of thinking,\nhowever, is not just that that they are epistemically unreliable. It\nis not just that the dominating party often falsely sees the dominated\nparty as lacking (or possessing) the allegedly superior (or inferior)\nqualities, or that the dominated party often internalizes false\nstereotypes of itself given by its oppressors, or that stereotypical\nthinking often overlooks salient and important differences among\nindividuals. More important, according to feminist analyses, the very\npremise of prescriptive dualism—the valuing of attributes of one\npolarized side and the devaluing of those of the other, the idea that\ndomination and oppression can be justified by appealing to attributes\nlike masculinity, rationality, being civilized or developed, etc.—is \nitself problematic. \nFeminism represents a radical challenge for environmental thinking,\npolitics, and traditional social ethical perspectives. It promises to\nlink environmental questions with wider social problems concerning\nvarious kinds of discrimination and exploitation, and fundamental\ninvestigations of human psychology. However, whether there are\nconceptual, causal or merely contingent connections among the\ndifferent forms of oppression and liberation remains a contested issue\n(see Green 1994). The term “ecofeminism” (first coined by\nFrançoise d’Eaubonne in 1974) or “ecological\nfeminism” was for a time generally applied to any view that\ncombines environmental advocacy with feminist analysis. However,\nbecause of the varieties of, and disagreements among, feminist\ntheories, the label may be too wide to be informative and has\ngenerally fallen from use. \nAn often overlooked source of ecological ideas is the work of the\nneo-Marxist Frankfurt School of critical theory founded by Max\nHorkheimer and Theodore Adorno (Horkheimer and Adorno 1969). While\nclassical Marxists regard nature as a resource to be transformed by\nhuman labour and utilized for human purposes, Horkheimer and Adorno\nsaw Marx himself as representative of the problem of “human\nalienation”. At the root of this alienation, they argue, is a\nnarrow positivist conception of rationality—which sees rationality\nas an instrument for pursuing progress, power and technological\ncontrol, and takes observation, measurement and the application of\npurely quantitative methods to be capable of solving all\nproblems. Such a positivistic view of science combines determinism\nwith optimism. Natural processes as well as human activities are seen\nto be predictable and manipulable. Nature (and, likewise, human\nnature) is no longer mysterious, uncontrollable, or fearsome. Instead,\nit is reduced to an object strictly governed by natural laws, which\ntherefore can be studied, known, and employed to our benefit. By\npromising limitless knowledge and power, the positivism of science and\ntechnology not only removes our fear of nature, the critical theorists\nargue, but also destroys our sense of awe and wonder towards it. That\nis to say, positivism “disenchants” nature—along with\neverything that can be studied by the sciences, whether natural,\nsocial or human. \nThe progress in knowledge and material well-being may not be a bad\nthing in itself, where the consumption and control of nature is a\nnecessary part of human life. However, the critical theorists argue\nthat the positivistic disenchantment of natural things (and, likewise,\nof human beings—because they too can be studied and manipulated by\nscience) disrupts our relationship with them, encouraging the\nundesirable attitude that they are nothing more than things to be\nprobed, consumed and dominated. According to the critical theorists,\nthe oppression of “outer nature” (i.e., the natural\nenvironment) through science and technology is bought at a very high\nprice: the project of domination requires the suppression of our own\n“inner nature” (i.e., human nature)—e.g., human\ncreativity, autonomy, and the manifold needs, vulnerabilities and\nlongings at the centre of human life. To remedy such an alienation,\nthe project of Horkheimer and Adorno is to replace the narrow\npositivistic and instrumentalist model of rationality with a more\nhumanistic one, in which the values of the aesthetic, moral, sensuous\nand expressive aspects of human life play a central part. Thus, their\naim is not to give up our rational faculties or powers of analysis and\nlogic. Rather, the ambition is to arrive at a dialectical synthesis\nbetween Romanticism and Enlightenment, to return to anti-deterministic\nvalues of freedom, spontaneity and creativity.  In his later work, Adorno advocates a re-enchanting aesthetic\nattitude of “sensuous immediacy” towards nature. Not only\ndo we stop seeing nature as primarily, or simply, an object of\nconsumption, we are also able to be directly and spontaneously\nacquainted with nature without interventions from our rational\nfaculties. According to Adorno, works of art, like natural things,\nalways involve an “excess”, something more than their mere\nmateriality and exchange value (see Vogel 1996, ch. 4.4 for a detailed\ndiscussion of Adorno’s views on art, labour and domination). The\nre-enchantment of the world through aesthetic experience, he argues,\nis also at the same time a re-enchantment of human lives and\npurposes. Adorno’s work remains largely unexplored in mainstream\nenvironmental philosophy, although the idea of applying critical\ntheory (embracing techniques of deconstruction, psychoanalysis and\nradical social criticism) to both environmental issues and the\nwritings of various ethical and political theorists has spawned an\nemerging field of “ecocritique” or\n“eco-criticism” (Vogel 1996, Luke 1997, van Wyk 1997,\nDryzek 1997). \nSome students of Adorno’s work have argued that his account\nof the role of “sensuous immediacy” can be understood as\nan attempt to defend a “legitimate anthropomorphism” that\ncomes close to a weak form of animism (Bernstein 2001, 196). Others,\nmore radical, have claimed to take inspiration from his notion of\n“non-identity”, which, they argue, can be used as the\nbasis for a deconstruction of the notion of nature and perhaps even\nits elimination from eco-critical writing. For example, Timothy Morton\nargues that “putting something called Nature on a pedestal and\nadmiring it from afar does for the environment what patriarchy does\nfor the figure of Woman. It is a paradoxical act of sadistic\nadmiration” (Morton 2007, 5), and that “in the name of all\nthat we value in the idea of ‘nature’, [ecocritique]\nthoroughly examines how nature is set up as a transcendental, unified,\nindependent category. Ecocritique does not think that it is\nparadoxical to say, in the name of ecology itself: ‘down with\nnature!’ ” (ibid., 13). \nIt remains to be seen, however, whether the radical attempt to purge\nthe concept of nature from eco-critical work meets with\nsuccess. Likewise, it is unclear whether the dialectic project on\nwhich Horkheimer and Adorno embarked is coherent, and whether Adorno,\nin particular, has a consistent understanding of “nature”\nand “rationality” (see Eckersley 1992 and Vogel 1996, for a\nreview of the Frankfurt School’s thinking about nature). \nOn the other hand, the  new animists have been much inspired\nby the serious way in which some indigenous peoples placate and\ninteract with animals, plants and inanimate things through ritual,\nceremony and other practices. According to the new animists, the\nreplacement of traditional animism (the view that personalized souls\nare found in animals, plants, and other material objects) by a form of\ndisenchanting positivism directly leads to an anthropocentric\nperspective, which is accountable for much human destructiveness\ntowards nature. In a disenchanted world, there is no meaningful order\nof things or events outside the human domain, and there is no source\nof sacredness or dread of the sort felt by those who regard the\nnatural world as peopled by divinities or demons (Stone 2006). When a\nforest is no longer sacred, there are no spirits to be placated and no\nmysterious risks associated with clear-felling it. A disenchanted\nnature is no longer alive. It commands no respect, reverence or\nlove. It is nothing but a giant machine, to be mastered to serve human\npurposes. The new animists argue for reconceptualizing the boundary\nbetween persons and non-persons. For them, “living nature”\ncomprises not only humans, animals and plants, but also mountains,\nforests, rivers, deserts, and even planets. \nWhether the notion that a mountain or a tree is to be regarded as a\nperson is taken literally or not, the attempt to engage with the\nsurrounding world as if it consists of other persons might possibly\nprovide the basis for a respectful attitude to nature (see Harvey 2005\nfor a popular account of the new animism). If disenchantment is a\nsource of environmental problems and destruction, then the new animism\ncan be regarded as attempting to re-enchant, and help to save,\nnature. More poetically, David Abram has argued that a\nphenomenological approach of the kind taken by Merleau-Ponty can\nreveal to us that we are part of the “common flesh” of the\nworld, that we are in a sense the world thinking itself (Abram\n1995). \nIn her work, Freya Mathews has tried to articulate a version\nof animism or panpsychism that captures ways in which the world (not\njust nature) contains many kinds of consciousness and sentience. For\nher, there is an underlying unity of mind and matter in that the world\nis a “self-realizing” system containing a multiplicity of\nother such systems (cf. Næss). According to Mathews, we are\nmeshed in communication, and potential communication, with the\n“One” (the greater cosmic self) and its many lesser selves\n(Mathews 2003, 45–60). Materialism (the monistic theory that the\nworld consists purely of matter), she argues, is self-defeating by\nencouraging a form of “collective solipsism” that treats\nthe world either as unknowable or as a social-construction (Mathews\n2005, 12). Mathews also takes inspiration from her interpretation of\nthe core Daoist idea of  wuwei  as “letting be” and bringing\nabout change through “effortless action”. The focus in\nenvironmental management, development and commerce should be on\n“synergy” with what is already in place rather than on\ndemolition, replacement and disruption. Instead of bulldozing away old\nsuburbs and derelict factories, the synergistic panpsychist sees these\nartefacts as themselves part of the living cosmos, hence part of what\nis to be respected. Likewise, instead of trying to eliminate feral or\nexotic plants and animals, and restore environments to some imagined\npristine state, ways should be found—wherever possible—to\npromote synergies between the newcomers and the older native\npopulations in ways that maintain ecological flows and promote the\nfurther unfolding and developing of ecological processes (Mathews\n2004). Panpsychism, Mathews argues, frees us from the\n“ideological grid of capitalism”, can reduce our desire\nfor consumer novelties, and can allow us and the world to grow old\ntogether with grace and dignity. \nIn summary, if disenchantment is a source of environmentally\ndestructive or uncaring attitudes, then both the aesthetic and the\nanimist/panpsychist re-enchantment of the world are intended to offer\nan antidote to such attitudes, and perhaps also inspirations for new\nforms of managing and designing for sustainability. \nApart from feminist-environmentalist theories and Næss’s deep\necology, Murray Bookchin’s “social ecology” has also claimed\nto be radical, subversive, or countercultural (see Bookchin 1980,\n1987, 1990). Bookchin’s version of critical theory takes the\n“outer” physical world as constituting what he calls\n“first nature”, from which culture or “second\nnature” has evolved. Environmentalism, on his view, is a social\nmovement, and the problems it confronts are social problems. While\nBookchin is prepared, like Horkheimer and Adorno, to regard (first)\nnature as an aesthetic and sensuous marvel, he regards our\nintervention in it as necessary. He suggests that we can choose to put\nourselves at the service of natural evolution, to help maintain\ncomplexity and diversity, diminish suffering and reduce\npollution. Bookchin’s social ecology recommends that we use our gifts\nof sociability, communication and intelligence as if we were\n“nature rendered conscious”, instead of turning them against\nthe very source and origin from which such gifts derive. Exploitation\nof nature should be replaced by a richer form of life devoted to\nnature’s preservation. \nJohn Clark has argued that social ecology is heir to a historical,\ncommunitarian tradition of thought that includes not only the\nanarchist Peter Kropotkin, but also the nineteenth century socialist\ngeographer Elisée Reclus, the eccentric Scottish thinker\nPatrick Geddes and the latter’s disciple, Lewis Mumford (Clark\n1998). Ramachandra Guha has described Mumford as “the pioneer\nAmerican social ecologist” (Guha 1996, 210). Mumford adopted a\nregionalist perspective, arguing that strong regional centres of\nculture are the basis of “active and securely grounded local\nlife” (Mumford 1944, 403). Like the pessimists in critical\ntheory, Mumford was worried about the emergence under industrialised\ncapitalism of a “megamachine”, one that would oppress and\ndominate human creativity and freedom, and one that—despite being a\nhuman product—operates in a way that is out of our control. While\nBookchin is more of a technological optimist than Mumford, both\nwriters have inspired a regional turn in environmental\nthinking. Bioregionalism gives regionalism an environmental\ntwist. This is the view that natural features should provide the\ndefining conditions for places of community, and that secure and\nsatisfying local lives are led by those who know a place, have learned\nits lore and who adapt their lifestyle to its affordances by\ndeveloping its potential within ecological limits. Such a life, the\nbioregionalists argue, will enable people to enjoy the fruits of\nself-liberation and self-development (see the essays in List 1993, and\nthe book-length treatment in Thayer 2003, for an introduction to\nbioregional thought). \nHowever, critics have asked why natural features should significant\nin defining the places in which communities are to be built, and have\npuzzled over exactly which natural features these should be—geological, \necological, climatic, hydrological, and so on (see Brennan\n1998b). If relatively small, bioregional communities are to be home to\nflourishing human societies, then a question also arises over the\nnature of the laws and punishments that will prevail in them, and also\nof their integration into larger regional and global political and\neconomic groupings. For anarchists and other critics of the\npredominant social order, a return to self-governing and\nself-sufficient regional communities is often depicted as liberating\nand refreshing. But for the skeptics, the worry remains that the\nbioregional vision is politically over-optimistic and is open to the\nestablishment of illiberal, stifling and undemocratic communities.\nFurther, given its emphasis on local self-sufficiency and the virtue\nof life in small communities, a question arises over whether\nbioregionalism is workable in an overcrowded planet. \nDeep ecology, feminism, and social ecology have had a considerable\nimpact on the development of political positions in regard to the\nenvironment. Feminist analyses have often been welcomed for the\npsychological insight they bring to several social, moral and\npolitical problems. There is, however, considerable unease about the\nimplications of critical theory, social ecology and some varieties of\ndeep ecology and animism. Some writers have argued, for\nexample, that critical theory is bound to be ethically\nanthropocentric, with nature as no more than a “social\nconstruction” whose value ultimately depends on human\ndeterminations (see Vogel 1996). Others have argued that the demands\nof “deep” green theorists and activists cannot be\naccommodated within contemporary theories of liberal politics and\nsocial justice (see Ferry 1998). A further suggestion is that there is\na need to reassess traditional theories such as virtue ethics, which\nhas its origins in ancient Greek philosophy (see the following\nsection) within the context of a form of stewardship similar to that\nearlier endorsed by Passmore (see Barry 1999). If this last claim is\ncorrect, then the radical activist need not, after all, look for\nphilosophical support in radical, or countercultural, theories of the\nsort deep ecology, feminism, bioregionalism and social ecology claim\nto be (but see Zimmerman 1994). \nAlthough environmental ethicists often try to distance themselves\nfrom the anthropocentrism embedded in traditional ethical views\n(Passmore 1974, Norton 1991 are exceptions), they also quite often\ndraw their theoretical resources from traditional ethical systems and\ntheories. Consider the following two basic moral questions: (1) What\nkinds of thing are intrinsically valuable, good or bad? (2) What makes\nan action right or wrong? \nConsequentialist ethical theories consider intrinsic\n“value” / “disvalue” or “goodness” /\n“badness” to be more fundamental moral notions than\n“rightness” / “wrongness”, and maintain that\nwhether an action is right/wrong is determined by whether its\nconsequences are good/bad. From this perspective, answers to question\n(2) are informed by answers to question (1). For instance,\nutilitarianism, a paradigm case of consequentialism, regards pleasure\n(or, more broadly construed, the satisfaction of interest, desire,\nand/or preference) as the only intrinsic value in the world, whereas\npain (or the frustration of desire, interest, and/or preference) is the\nonly intrinsic disvalue, and maintains that right actions are those\nthat would produce the greatest balance of pleasure over pain. \nAs the utilitarian focus is the balance of pleasure and pain as such,\nthe question of to whom a pleasure or pain belongs is irrelevant to\nthe calculation and assessment of the rightness or wrongness of\nactions. Hence, the eighteenth century utilitarian Jeremy Bentham\n(1789), and now Peter Singer (1993), have argued that the interests of\nall the sentient beings (i.e., beings who are capable of experiencing\npleasure or pain)—including non-human ones—affected by an action\nshould be taken equally into consideration in assessing the\naction. Furthermore, rather like Routley (see section 2 above), Singer\nargues that the anthropocentric privileging of members of the species\nHomo sapiens is arbitrary, and that it is a kind of\n“speciesism” as unjustifiable as sexism and racism. Singer\nregards the animal liberation movement as comparable to the liberation\nmovements of women and people of colour. Unlike the environmental\nphilosophers who attribute intrinsic value to the natural environment\nand its inhabitants, Singer and utilitarians in general attribute\nintrinsic value to the experience of pleasure or interest satisfaction\nas such, not to the beings who have the experience. Similarly, for the\nutilitarian, non-sentient objects in the environment such as plant\nspecies, rivers, mountains, and landscapes, all of which are the\nobjects of moral concern for environmentalists, are of no intrinsic\nbut at most instrumental value to the satisfaction of sentient beings\n(see Singer 1993, Ch. 10). Furthermore, because right actions, for the\nutilitarian, are those that maximize the overall balance of interest\nsatisfaction over frustration, practices such as whale-hunting and the\nkilling of an elephant for ivory, which cause suffering to non-human\nanimals, might turn out to be right after all: such practices might\nproduce considerable amounts of interest-satisfaction for human\nbeings, which, on the utilitarian calculation, outweigh the non-human\ninterest-frustration involved. As the result of all the above\nconsiderations, it is unclear to what extent a utilitarian ethic can\nalso be an environmental ethic. This point may not so readily apply to\na wider consequentialist approach, which attributes intrinsic value\nnot only to pleasure or satisfaction, but also to various objects and\nprocesses in the natural environment. \nDeontological ethical theories, in contrast, maintain that\nwhether an action is right or wrong is for the most part independent\nof whether its consequences are good or bad. From the deontologist\nperspective, there are several distinct moral rules or duties (e.g.,\n“not to kill or otherwise harm the innocent”, “not to\nlie”, “to respect the rights of others”, “to keep\npromises”), the observance/violation of which is intrinsically\nright/wrong; i.e., right/wrong in itself regardless of\nconsequences. When asked to justify an alleged moral rule, duty or its\ncorresponding right, deontologists may appeal to the intrinsic value\nof those beings to whom it applies. For instance, “animal\nrights” advocate Tom Regan (1983) argues that those animals with\nintrinsic value (or what he calls “inherent value”) have the\nmoral right to respectful treatment, which then generates a general\nmoral duty on our part not to treat them as mere means to other\nends. We have, in particular, a prima facie moral duty not to harm\nthem. Regan maintains that certain practices (such as sport or\ncommercial hunting, and experimentation on animals) violate the moral\nright of intrinsically valuable animals to respectful treatment. Such\npractices, he argues, are intrinsically wrong regardless of whether or\nnot some better consequences ever flow from them. Exactly which\nanimals have intrinsic value and therefore the moral right to\nrespectful treatment? Regan’s answer is: those that meet the criterion\nof being the “subject-of-a-life”. To be such a subject is a\nsufficient (though not necessary) condition for having intrinsic\nvalue, and to be a subject-of-a-life involves, among other things,\nhaving sense-perceptions, beliefs, desires, motives, memory, a sense\nof the future, and a psychological identity over time. \nSome authors have extended concern for individual well-being further,\narguing for the intrinsic value of organisms achieving their own good,\nwhether those organisms are capable of consciousness or not. Paul\nTaylor’s version of this view (1981 and 1986), which we might call\nbiocentrism, is a deontological example. He argues that each\nindividual living thing in nature—whether it is an animal, a plant,\nor a micro-organism—is a “teleological-center-of-life”\nhaving a good or well-being of its own which can be enhanced or\ndamaged, and that all individuals who are teleological-centers-of life\nhave equal intrinsic value (or what he calls “inherent\nworth”) which entitles them to moral respect. Furthermore, Taylor\nmaintains that the intrinsic value of wild living things generates a\nprima facie moral duty on our part to preserve or promote their goods\nas ends in themselves, and that any practices which treat those beings\nas mere means and thus display a lack of respect for them are\nintrinsically wrong.  A more recent and biologically detailed defence\nof the idea that living things have representations and goals and\nhence have moral worth is found in Agar 2001. Unlike Taylor’s\negalitarian and deontological biocentrism, Robin Attfield (1987)\nargues for a hierarchical view that while all beings having a good of\ntheir own have intrinsic value, some of them (e.g., persons) have\nintrinsic value to a greater extent. Attfield also endorses a form of\nconsequentialism which takes into consideration, and attempts to\nbalance, the many and possibly conflicting goods of different living\nthings (also see Varner 1998 for a defense of biocentric\nindividualism with affinities to both consequentialist and\ndeontological approaches). However, some critics have pointed out that\nthe notion of biological good or well-being is only descriptive not\nprescriptive (see Williams 1992 and O’Neill 1993, Ch. 2). For\ninstance, even if HIV has a good of its own this does not mean that\nwe ought to assign any positive moral weight to the realization of\nthat good. \nMore recently, the distinction between these two traditional\napproaches has taken its own specific form of development in\nenvironmental philosophy.  Instead of pitting conceptions of value\nagainst conceptions of rights, it has been suggested that there may be\ntwo different conceptions of intrinsic value in play in discussion\nabout environmental good and evil.  One the one side, there is the\nintrinsic value of states of affairs that are to be promoted - and\nthis is the focus of the consequentialist thinkers.  On the other\n(deontological) hand there is the intrinsic values of entities to be\nrespected (see Bradley 2006, McShane 2014).  These two different foci\nfor the notion of intrinsic value still provide room for fundamental\nargument between deontologists and consequentialist to continue,\nalbeit in a somewhat modified form.\n \nNote that the ethics of animal liberation or animal rights and\nbiocentrism are both individualistic in that their various\nmoral concerns are directed towards individuals only—not ecological\nwholes such as species, populations, biotic communities, and\necosystems. None of these is sentient, a subject-of-a-life, or a\nteleological-center-of-life, but the preservation of these collective\nentities is a major concern for many environmentalists. Moreover, the\ngoals of animal liberationists, such as the reduction of animal\nsuffering and death, may conflict with the goals of\nenvironmentalists. For example, the preservation of the integrity of\nan ecosystem may require the culling of feral animals or of some\nindigenous animal populations that threaten to destroy fragile habitats. So\nthere are disputes about whether the ethics of animal liberation is a\nproper branch of environmental ethics (see Callicott 1980, 1988,\nSagoff 1984, Jamieson 1998, Crisp 1998 and Varner 2000). \nCriticizing the individualistic approach in general for failing to\naccommodate conservation concerns for ecological wholes, J. Baird\nCallicott (1980) once advocated a version of land-ethical\nholism which takes Leopold’s statement “A thing is right\nwhen it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the\nbiotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise” to be the\nsupreme deontological principle. In this theory, the Earth’s biotic\ncommunity per se is the sole locus of intrinsic value, whereas the\nvalue of its individual members is merely instrumental and dependent\non their contribution to the “integrity, stability, and\nbeauty” of the larger community. A straightforward implication of\nthis version of the land ethic is that an individual member of the\nbiotic community ought to be sacrificed whenever that is needed for\nthe protection of the holistic good of the community. For instance,\nCallicott maintains that if culling a white-tailed deer is necessary\nfor the protection of the holistic biotic good, then it is a\nland-ethical requirement to do so. But, to be consistent, the same\npoint also applies to human individuals because they are also members\nof the biotic community. Not surprisingly, the misanthropy implied by\nCallicott’s land-ethical holism was widely criticized and\nregarded as a reductio of the position (see Aiken (1984), Kheel\n(1985), Ferré (1996), and Shrader-Frechette (1996)). Tom Regan\n(1983, p.362), in particular, condemned the holistic land ethic’s\ndisregard of the rights of the individual as “environmental\nfascism”.   Under pressure from the charge of ecofascism and misanthropy,\nCallicott (1989 Ch. 5, and 1999, Ch. 4) later revised his position and\nnow maintains that the biotic community (indeed, any community to\nwhich we belong) as well as its individual members (indeed, any\nindividual who shares with us membership in some common community) all\nhave intrinsic value. To further distance himself from the charge of\necofascism, Callicott introduced explicit principles which prioritize\nobligations to human communities over those to natural ones.  He\ncalled these “second-order” principles for specifying the\nconditions under which the land ethic’s holistic and individualistic\nobligations were to be ranked.  As he put it: \nLo (in Lo 2001) provides an overview and critique of Callicott’s\nchanging position over two decades, while Ouderkirk and Hill (eds.)\n2002 gives an overview of debates between Callicott and others\nconcerning the metaethical and metaphysical foundations for the land\nethic and also its historical antecedents.  As Lo pointed out, the\nfinal modified version of the land ethic needs more than two\nsecond-order principles, since a third-order principle is needed to\nspecify Callicott’s implicit view that the second second-order\nprinciple generally countermands the first one when they come into\nconflict (Lo 2001, 345).  In his most recent work, Callicott follows\nLo’s suggestion, while cautioning against aiming for too much\nprecision in specifying the demands of the land ethic (Callicott 2013,\n66 - 7).  The controversy surrounding Callicott’s original position,\nhowever, has inspired efforts in environmental ethics to investigate\npossibilities of attributing intrinsic value to ecological wholes, not\njust their individual constituent parts.  Following in Callicott’s\nfootsteps, and inspired by Næss’s relational account of value,\nWarwick Fox has championed a theory of “responsive\ncohesion” which apparently gives supreme moral priority to the\nmaintenance of ecosystems and the biophysical world (Fox 2007).  It\nremains to be seen if this position escapes the charges of misanthropy\nand totalitarianism laid against earlier holistic and relational\ntheories of value.  \nIndividual natural entities (whether sentient or not, living or not),\nAndrew Brennan (1984, 2014) argues, are not designed by anyone to fulfill\nany purpose and therefore lack “intrinsic function” (i.e.,\nthe function of a thing that constitutes part of its essence or\nidentity conditions). This, he proposes, is a reason for thinking that\nindividual natural entities should not be treated as mere instruments,\nand thus a reason for assigning them intrinsic value. Furthermore, he\nargues that the same moral point applies to the case of natural\necosystems, to the extent that they lack intrinsic function. In the\nlight of Brennan’s proposal, Eric Katz (1991 and 1997) argues that all\nnatural entities, whether individuals or wholes, have intrinsic value\nin virtue of their ontological independence from human purpose,\nactivity, and interest, and maintains the deontological principle that\nnature as a whole is an “autonomous subject” which deserves\nmoral respect and must not be treated as a mere means to human\nends. Carrying the project of attributing intrinsic value to nature to\nits ultimate form, Robert Elliot (1997) argues that naturalness itself\nis a property in virtue of possessing which all natural things,\nevents, and states of affairs, attain intrinsic value. Furthermore,\nElliot argues that even a consequentialist, who in principle allows\nthe possibility of trading off intrinsic value from naturalness for\nintrinsic value from other sources, could no longer justify such kind\nof trade-off in reality. This is because the reduction of intrinsic\nvalue due to the depletion of naturalness on Earth, according to him,\nhas reached such a level that any further reduction of it could not be\ncompensated by any amount of intrinsic value generated in other ways,\nno matter how great it is.  As the notion of “natural” is understood in terms of\nthe lack of human contrivance and is often opposed to the notion of\n“artifactual”, one much contested issue is about the value\nof those parts of nature that have been interfered with by human\nartifice—for instance, previously degraded natural environments\nwhich have been humanly restored. Based on the premise that the\nproperties of being naturally evolved and having a natural continuity\nwith the remote past are “value adding” (i.e., adding\nintrinsic value to those things which possess those two properties),\nElliot argues that even a perfectly restored environment would\nnecessarily lack those two value-adding properties and therefore be\nless valuable than the originally undegraded natural\nenvironment. Katz, on the other hand, argues that a restored nature is\nreally just an artifact designed and created for the satisfaction of\nhuman ends, and that the value of restored environments is merely\ninstrumental. However, some critics have pointed out that advocates of\nmoral dualism between the natural and the artifactual run the risk of\ndiminishing the value of human life and culture, and fail to recognize\nthat the natural environments interfered with by humans may still have\nmorally relevant qualities other than pure naturalness (see Lo\n1999). Two other issues central to this debate are that the key\nconcept “natural” seems ambiguous in many different ways\n(see Hume 1751, App. 3; Mill 1874; Brennan [1988] 2014; Ch. 6; Elliot 1997,\nCh. 4), and that those who argue that human interference reduces the\nintrinsic value of nature seem to have simply assumed the crucial\npremise that naturalness is a source of intrinsic value. Some thinkers\nmaintain that the natural, or the “wild” construed as that\nwhich “is not humanized” (Hettinger and Throop 1999,\np. 12) or to some degree “not under human control” (ibid.,\np. 13) is intrinsically valuable. Yet, as Bernard Williams points out\n(Williams 1992), we may, paradoxically, need to use our technological\npowers to retain a sense of something not being in our power. The\nretention of wild areas may thus involve planetary and ecological\nmanagement to maintain, or even “imprison” such areas\n(Birch 1990), raising a question over the extent to which national\nparks and wilderness areas are free from our control. An important\nmessage underlying the debate, perhaps, is that even if ecological\nrestoration is achievable, it might have been better to have left\nnature intact in the first place. \nGiven the significance of the concept of naturalness in these debates,\nit is perhaps surprising that there has been relatively little\nanalysis of that concept itself in environmental thought.  In his\npioneering work on the ethics of the environment, Holmes Rolston has\nworked with a number of different conceptions of the natural (see\nBrennan and Lo 2010, pp.116–23, for an analysis three senses of\nthe term \"natural\" that may be found in Rolston’s work).  An explicit\nattempt to provide a conceptual analysis of a different sort is found\nin Siipi 2008, while an account of naturalness linking this to\nhistorical narratives of place is given in O’Neill, Holland and Light\n2008, ch. 8 (compare the response to this in Siipi 2011).\n \nAs an alternative to consequentialism and deontology both of which\nconsider “thin” concepts such as “goodness”\nand “rightness” as essential to morality, virtue\nethics proposes to understand morality—and assess the\nethical quality of actions—in terms of “thick”\nconcepts such as “kindness”, “honesty”,\n“sincerity” and “justice”. As virtue ethics\nspeaks quite a different language from the other two kinds of ethical\ntheory, its theoretical focus is not so much on what kinds of things\nare good/bad, or what makes an action right/wrong.  Indeed, the\nrichness of the language of virtues, and the emphasis on moral\ncharacter, is sometimes cited as a reason for exploring a\nvirtues-based approach to the complex and always-changing questions of\nsustainability and environmental care (Hill 1983, Wensveen 2000,\nSandler 2007). One question central to virtue ethics is what the moral\nreasons are for acting one way or another. For instance, from the\nperspective of virtue ethics, kindness and loyalty would be moral\nreasons for helping a friend in hardship. These are quite different\nfrom the deontologist’s reason (that the action is demanded by a moral\nrule) or the consequentialist reason (that the action will lead to a\nbetter over-all balance of good over evil in the world). From the\nperspective of virtue ethics, the motivation and justification of\nactions are both inseparable from the character traits of the acting\nagent. Furthermore, unlike deontology or consequentialism the moral\nfocus of which is other people or states of the world, one central\nissue for virtue ethics is how to live a flourishing human life, this\nbeing a central concern of the moral agent himself or\nherself. “Living virtuously” is Aristotle’s recipe for\nflourishing. Versions of virtue ethics advocating virtues such as\n“benevolence”, “piety”,\n“filiality”, and “courage”, have also been\nheld by thinkers in the Chinese Confucian tradition. The connection\nbetween morality and psychology is another core subject of\ninvestigation for virtue ethics. It is sometimes suggested that human\nvirtues, which constitute an important aspect of a flourishing human\nlife, must be compatible with human needs and desires, and perhaps\nalso sensitive to individual affection and temperaments. As its\ncentral focus is human flourishing as such, virtue ethics may seem\nunavoidably anthropocentric and unable to support a genuine moral\nconcern for the non-human environment. But just as Aristotle has\nargued that a flourishing human life requires friendships and one can\nhave genuine friendships only if one genuinely values, loves,\nrespects, and cares for one’s friends for their own sake, not merely\nfor the benefits that they may bring to oneself, some have argued that\na flourishing human life requires the moral capacities to value, love,\nrespect, and care for the non-human natural world as an end in itself\n(see O’Neill 1992, O’Neill 1993, Barry 1999).  Despite the variety of positions in environmental ethics developed\nover the last thirty years, they have focused mainly on issues\nconcerned with wilderness and the reasons for its preservation (see\nCallicott and Nelson 1998 for a collection of essays on the ideas and\nmoral significance of wilderness). The importance of wilderness\nexperience to the human psyche has been emphasized by many\nenvironmental philosophers. Næss, for instance, urges us to\nensure we spend time dwelling in situations of intrinsic value,\nwhereas Rolston seeks “re-creation” of the human soul by\nmeditating in the wilderness. Likewise, the critical theorists believe\nthat aesthetic appreciation of nature has the power to re-enchant\nhuman life. As wilderness becomes increasingly rare, people’s exposure\nto wild things in their natural state has become reduced, and\naccording to some authors this may reduce the chance of our lives and\nother values being transformed as a result of interactions with\nnature.  An argument by Bryan Norton draws attention to an analogy\nwith music.  Someone exposed for the first time to a new musical genre\nmay undergo a transformation in musical preferences, tastes and values\nas a result of the experience (Norton 1987).  Such a transformation can\naffect their other preferences and desires too, in both direct and\nindirect ways (see Sarkar 2005, ch. 4, esp. pp. 82–7).  In the\nattempt to preserve opportunities for experiences that can change or\nenhance people’s valuations of nature, there has been a move since the\nearly 2000s to find ways of rewilding degraded environments, and even\nparts of cities (Fraser 2009, Monbiot 2013).(  By contrast to the focus on wild places, relatively little\nattention has been paid to the built environment, although this is the\none in which most people spend most of their time. In post-war\nBritain, for example, cheaply constructed new housing developments\nwere often poor replacements for traditional communities. They have\nbeen associated with lower amounts of social interaction and increased\ncrime compared with the earlier situation. The destruction of highly\nfunctional high-density traditional housing, indeed, might be compared\nwith the destruction of highly diverse ecosystems and biotic\ncommunities. Likewise, the loss of the world’s huge diversity of\nnatural languages has been mourned by many, not just professionals\nwith an interest in linguistics. Urban and linguistic environments are\njust two of the many “places” inhabited by humans. Some\nphilosophical theories about natural environments and objects have\npotential to be extended to cover built environments and non-natural\nobjects of several sorts (see King 2000, Light 2001, Palmer 2003,\nwhile Fox 2007 aims to include both built and natural environments in\nthe scope of a single ethical theory). Certainly there are many\nparallels between natural and artificial domains: for example, many of\nthe conceptual problems involved in discussing the restoration of\nnatural objects also appear in the parallel context of restoring\nhuman-made objects. \nThe focus on the value of wilderness and the importance of its\npreservation has overlooked another important problem—namely\nthat lifestyles in which enthusiasms for nature rambles, woodland\nmeditations or mountaineering can be indulged demand a standard of\nliving that is far beyond the dreams of most of the world’s\npopulation. Moreover, mass access to wild places would likely destroy\nthe very values held in high esteem by the “natural\naristocrats”, a term used by Hugh Stretton (1976) to\ncharacterize the environmentalists “driven chiefly by love of\nthe wilderness”. Thus, a new range of moral and political\nproblems open up, including the environmental cost of tourist access\nto wilderness areas, and ways in which limited access could be\narranged to areas of natural beauty and diversity, while maintaining\nthe individual freedoms central to liberal democracies.  Lovers of wilderness sometimes consider the high human populations\nin some developing countries as a key problem underlying the\nenvironmental crisis. Rolston (1996), for instance, claims that (some)\nhumans are a kind of planetary “cancer”. He maintains that\nwhile “feeding people always seems humane, ... when we face up\nto what is really going on, by just feeding people, without attention\nto the larger social results, we could be feeding a kind of\ncancer.” This remark is meant to justify the view that saving\nnature should, in some circumstances, have a higher priority than\nfeeding people. But such a view has been criticized for seeming to\nreveal a degree of misanthropy, directed at those human beings least\nable to protect and defend themselves (see Attfield 1998, Brennan\n1998a). The empirical basis of Rolston’s claims has been queried by\nwork showing that poor people are often extremely good environmental\nmanagers (Martinez-Alier 2002). Guha’s worries about the elitist and\n“missionary” tendencies of some kinds of deep green\nenvironmentalism in certain rich western countries can be quite\nreadily extended to theorists such as Rolston (Guha 1999). Can such an\napparently elitist sort of wilderness ethics ever be democratised? How\ncan the psychically-reviving power of the wild become available to\nthose living in the slums of Calcutta or São Paolo? These questions so\nfar lack convincing answers.  Furthermore, the economic conditions which support the kind of\nenjoyment of wilderness by Stretton’s “natural\naristocrats”, and more generally the lifestyles of many people\nin the affluent countries, seem implicated in the destruction and\npollution which has provoked the environmental turn in the first\nplace. For those in the richer countries, for instance, engaging in\noutdoor recreations usually involves the motor car. Car dependency,\nhowever, is at the heart of many environmental problems, a key factor\nin urban pollution, while at the same time central to the economic and\nmilitary activities of many nations and corporations, for example\nsecuring and exploiting oil reserves. In an increasingly crowded\nindustrialised world, the answers to such problems are pressing. Any\nadequate study of this intertwined set of problems must involve\ninterdisciplinary collaboration among philosophers and theorists in\nthe social as well as the natural sciences.  Connections between environmental destruction, unequal resource\nconsumption, poverty and the global economic order have been discussed\nby political scientists, development theorists, geographers and\neconomists as well as by philosophers. Links between economics and\nenvironmental ethics are particularly well established. Work by Mark\nSagoff (1988), for instance, has played a major part in bringing the\ntwo fields together. He argues that “as citizens rather than\nconsumers” people are concerned about values, which cannot\nplausibly be reduced to mere ordered preferences or quantified in\nmonetary terms.  Sagoff’s distinction between people as consumers and\npeople as citizens was intended to blunt the use of cost-benefit\nanalysis as the final arbiter in discussions about nature’s value.  Of\ncourse, spouses take out insurance on each others’ lives.  We pay\nextra for travel insurance to cover the cost of cancellation, illness,\nor lost baggage.  Such actions are economically rational.  They\nprovide us with some compensation in case of loss.  No-one, however,\nwould regard insurance payments as replacing lost limbs, a loved one\nor even the joys of a cancelled vacation. So it is for nature,\naccording to Sagoff.  We can put dollar values on a stand of timber, a\nreef, a beach, a national park.  We can measure the travel costs, the\nmoney spent by visitors, the real estate values, the park fees and all\nthe rest.  But these dollar measures do not tell us the value of\nnature any more than my insurance premiums tell you the value of a\nhuman life (also see Shrader-Frechette 1987, O’Neill 1993, and Brennan\n1995). If Sagoff is right, cost-benefit analysis of the kind mentioned\nin section 5 above cannot be a basis for an ethic of sustainability\nany more than for an ethic of biodiversity.  The potentially\nmisleading appeal to economic reason used to justify the expansion of\nthe corporate sector has also come under critical scrutiny by\nglobalisation theorists (see Korten 1999). These critiques do not aim\nto eliminate economics from environmental thinking; rather, they\nresist any reductive, and strongly anthropocentric, tendency to\nbelieve that all social and environmental problems are fundamentally\nor essentially economic. \nOther interdisciplinary approaches link environmental ethics with\nbiology, policy studies, public administration, political theory,\ncultural history, post-colonial theory, literature, geography, and\nhuman ecology (for some examples, see Norton, Hutchins, Stevens, Maple\n1995, Shrader-Frechette 1984, Gruen and Jamieson (eds.) 1994, Karliner\n1997, Diesendorf and Hamilton 1997, Schmidtz and Willott 2002). Many\nassessments of issues concerned with biodiversity, ecosystem health,\npoverty, environmental justice and sustainability look at both human\nand environmental issues, eschewing in the process commitment either\nto a purely anthropocentric or purely ecocentric perspective (see\nHayward and O’Neill 1997, and Dobson 1999 for collections of essays\nlooking at the links between sustainability, justice, welfare and the\ndistribution of environmental goods). The future development of\nenvironmental ethics depend on these, and other interdisciplinary\nsynergies, as much as on its anchorage within philosophy. \nThe Convention on Biological Diversity discussed in section 5 was\ninfluenced by\n Our Common Future,\n an earlier United Nations document on sustainability\nproduced by the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED\n1987).  The commission was chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime\nMinister of Norway at the time, and the report is sometimes known as\nthe Brundtland Report.  This report noted the increasing tide of\nevidence that planetary systems vital to supporting life on Earth were\nunder strain.  The key question it raised is whether it is equitable\nto sacrifice options for future well-being in favour of supporting\ncurrent lifestyles, especially the comfortable, and sometimes lavish,\nforms of life enjoyed in the rich countries.  As Bryan Norton puts it,\nthe world faces a global challenge to see whether different human\ngroups, with widely varying perspectives, can perhaps “accept\nresponsibility to maintain a non-declining set of opportunities based\non possible uses of the environment”. The preservation of\noptions for the future can be readily linked to notions of equity if\nit is agreed that “the future ought not to face, as a result of\nour actions today, a seriously reduced range of options and choices,\nas they try to adapt to the environment that they face” (Norton\n2001: 97).  Note that references to “the future” need not\nbe limited to the future of human beings only. In keeping with the\nnon-anthropocentric focus of much environmental philosophy, a care for\nsustainability and biodiversity can embrace a care for opportunities\navailable to non-human living things. \nHowever, when the concept “sustainable development” was\nfirst articulated in the Brundtland Report, the emphasis was clearly\nanthropocentric. In face of increasing evidence that planetary systems\nvital to life-support were under strain, the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment is constructed in the report to encourage certain globally\ncoordinated directions and types of economic and social\ndevelopment. The report defines “sustainable development”\nin the following way: Sustainable development is development that meets the\nneeds of the present without compromising the ability of future\ngenerations to meet their own needs. It contains within it two key\nconcepts: \nThus the goals of economic and social development must be defined in\nterms of sustainability in all countries—developed or\ndeveloping, market-oriented or centrally planned. Interpretations will\nvary, but must share certain general features and must flow from a\nconsensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a\nbroad strategic framework for achieving it. (WCED 1987, Ch. 2,\nparagraphs 1–2) \nThe report goes on to argue that “the industrial world has already\nused much of the planet’s ecological capital.  This inequality is the\nplanet’s main ‘environmental’ problem; it is also its main\n‘development’ problem” (WCED 1987, Overview, paragraph 17).  In the\nconcept of sustainable development the report combines the resource\neconomist’s notion of “sustainable yield” with the recognition that\ndeveloping countries of the world are entitled to economic growth and\nprosperity.  The notion of sustainable yield involves thinking of\nforests, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, including the natural\nspecies living in them, as a stock of “ecological capital” from which\nall kinds of goods and services flow.  Provided the flow of such goods\nand services does not reduce the capacity of the capital itself to\nmaintain its productivity, the use of the systems in question is\nregarded as sustainable.  Thus, the report argues that “maximum\nsustainable yield must be defined after taking into account\nsystem-wide effects of exploitation” of ecological capital (WCED 1987,\nCh. 2, paragraph 11). \nThere are clear philosophical, political and economic precursors to\nthe Brundtland concept of sustainability. For example, John Stuart\nMill (1848, IV. 6. 1) distinguished between the\n“stationary state” and\nthe “progressive state”\nand argued that at the end of the progressive state lies the\nstationary state, since “the increase of wealth\nis not boundless”. Mill also recognized a debt\nto the gloomy prognostications of Thomas Malthus,\n who had conjectured that population tends to increase\ngeometrically while food resources at best increase only\narithmetically, so that demand for food will inevitably outstrip the\nsupply (see Milgate and Stimson 2009, Ch. 7, and the discussion of\n Malthus in the Political Economy section of the entry on\n Mill\n  in the Spring 2016 Edition). Reflection on Malthus\nled Mill to argue for restraining human population growth: Such warnings resonate with more recent pessimism about increasing\nhuman population and its impact on the poorest people, as well as on\nloss of biodiversity, fresh water scarcity, overconsumption and\nclimate change.  In their controversial work The Population\nBomb, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, argue that without restrictions on\npopulation growth, including the imposition of mandatory birth\ncontrol, the world faced “mass starvation” in the short\nterm (Ehrlich 1968). In a subsequent defence of their early work, the\nEhrlichs declared that the most serious flaw in their original\nanalysis “was that it was much too optimistic about the\nfuture”, and comment that “Since The Bomb was written,\nincreases in greenhouse gas flows into the atmosphere, a consequence\nof the near doubling of the human population and the near tripling of\nglobal consumption, indicate that the results will likely be\ncatastrophic climate disruption caused by greenhouse heating”\n(Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2009, 66).  It was also in 1968 that Garrett\nHardin published his much cited article on the “tragedy of the\ncommons” showing that common resources are always subject to\ndegradation and extinction in the face of the rational pursuit of self\ninterest.  For Hardin, the increasing pressure on shared resources,\nand increasing pollution, are inevitable results of the fact that\n“there is no technical solution to the population problem”\n(Hardin 1968). The problem may be analysed from the perspective of the\nso-called\n prisoner’s dilemma\n (also see the\n free rider problem).\n Despite the pessimism of writers at the time, and the\nadvocacy of setting limits to population growth, there was also an\noptimism that echoes Mill’s own view that a “stationary\nstate” would not be one of misery and decline, but rather one in\nwhich humans could aspire to more equitable distribution of available\nand limited resources. This is clear not only among those who\nrecognize limits to economic growth (Meadows et al. 1972) but also\namong those who champion the move to a steady state economy (Daly\n1991) or at least want to see more account taken of ecology in\neconomics (Norgaard 1994). \nThe Brundtland report puts less emphasis on limits than do Mill,\nMalthus and these more recent writers. It depicts sustainability as a\nchallenge and opportunity for the world to become more socially,\npolitically and environmentally fair.  In pursuit of\n intergenerational justice,\n it suggests that there should be new\nhuman rights added to the standard list, for example, that “All human\nbeings have the fundamental right to an environment adequate for their\nhealth and well being” (WCED 1987, Annexe 1, paragraph 1). The report\nalso argues that “The enjoyment of any right requires respect for the\nsimilar rights of others, and recognition of reciprocal and even joint\nresponsibilities. States have a responsibility towards their own\ncitizens and other states” (ibid., chapter 12, paragraph 83).  Since\nthe report’s publication, many writers have supported and defended the\nview that global and\n economic justice\n require that nations which had become wealthy through\nearlier industrialization and environmental exploitation should allow\nless developed nations similar or equivalent opportunities for\ndevelopment especially in term of access to environmental resources\n(Redclift 2005).  As intended by the report the idea of sustainable\ndevelopment has become strongly integrated into the notion of\nenvironmental conservation.  The report has also set the scene for a\nrange of subsequent international conferences, declarations, and\nprotocols many of them maintaining the emphasis on the prospects for\nthe future of humanity, rather than considering sustainability in any\nwider sense.  Some early commentators on the notion of sustainable development\nhave been critical of the way the notion mixes together moral ideas of\njustice and fairness with technical ideas in economics.  The objection\nis that sustainability as, in part, an economic and scientific notion,\nshould not be fused with evaluative ideals (Beckerman 1994). This\nobjection has not generally been widely taken up. Mark Sagoff has\nobserved that environmental policy “is most characterized by the\nopposition between instrumental values and aesthetic and moral\njudgments and convictions” (Sagoff 2004: 20).  Some\nnon-anthropocentric environmental thinkers have found the language of\neconomics unsatisfactory in its implications since it already appears\nto assume a largely instrumental view of nature.  The use of notions\nsuch as “asset”, “capital” and even the word\n“resources” in connection with natural objects and systems\nhas been identified by some writers as instrumentalizing natural\nthings which are in essence wild and free.  The objection is that such\nlanguage promotes the tendency to think of natural things as mere\nresources for humans or as raw materials with which human labour could\nbe mixed, not only to produce consumable goods, but also to generate\nhuman ownership (Plumwood 1993, Sagoff 2004). If natural objects and\nsystems have intrinsic value independent of their possible use for\nhumans, as many environmental philosophers have argued, then a policy\napproach to sustainability needs to consider the environment and\nnatural things not only in instrumental and but also in intrinsic\nterms to do justice to the moral standing that many people believe\nsuch items possess. Despite its acknowledgment of there being\n“moral, ethical, cultural, aesthetic, and purely scientific\nreasons for conserving wild beings” (WCED 1987, Overview,\nparagraph 53), the strongly anthropocentric and instrumental language\nused throughout the Brundtland report in articulating the notion of\nsustainable development can be criticised for defining the notion too\nnarrowly, leaving little room for addressing sustainability questions\ndirectly concerning the Earth’s environment and its non-human\ninhabitants: should, and if so, how should, human beings reorganise\ntheir ways of life and the social-political structures of their\ncommunities to allow sustainability and equity not only for all humans\nbut also for the other species on the planet? \nThe preservation concern for nature and non-human species is addressed\nto some extent by making a distinction between weaker and stronger\nconceptions of sustainability (Beckerman 1995).  The distinction\nemerged from considering the question: what exactly does sustainable\ndevelopment seek to sustain?  Is it the flow of goods and services from\nworld markets that is to be maintained, or is it the current—or\nsome future—level of consumption?  In answering such questions,\nproponents of weak sustainability argue that it is acceptable to\nreplace natural capital with human-made capital provided that the\nlatter has equivalent functions.  If, for example, plastic trees could\nproduce oxygen, absorb carbon and support animal and insect\ncommunities, then they could replace the real thing, and a world with\nfunctionally equivalent artificial trees would seem just as good as\none with real or natural trees in it.  For weak sustainability\ntheorists, the aim of future development should be to maintain a\nconsistently productive stock of capital on which to draw, while not\ninsisting that some portion of that capital be natural. Strong\nsustainability theorists, by contrast, generally resist the\nsubstitution of human for natural capital, insisting that a critical\nstock of natural things and processes be preserved.  By so doing, they\nargue, we maintain stocks of rivers, forests and biodiverse systems,\nhence providing maximum options—options in terms of experience,\nappreciation, values, and ways of life—for the future human\ninhabitants of the planet (Norton 2005). The Brundtland report can\nalso be seen as advocating a form of strong sustainability in so far\nas it recommends that a “first priority is to establish the problem of\ndisappearing species and threatened ecosystems on political agendas as\na major resource issue” (ibid., chapter 6, paragraph 57). Furthermore,\ndespite its instrumental and economic language, the report in fact\nendorses a wider moral perspective on the status of and our relation\nto nature and non-human species, evidenced by its statement that “the\ncase for the conservation of nature should not rest only with\ndevelopment goals. It is part of our moral obligation to other living\nbeings and future generations” (WCED 1987, chapter 2, paragraph 55).\nImplicit in the statement is not only a strong conception of\nsustainability but also a non-anthropocentric conception of the\nnotion.  Over time, strong sustainability has come to be focused not\nonly on the needs of human and other living things but also on their\nrights (Redclift 2004, 218).  In a further development, the discourses\non forms of sustainability have generally given way in the last decade\nto a more ambiguous usage, in which the term “sustainability”\nfunctions to bring people into a debate rather than setting out a\nclear definition of the terms of the debate itself.  As globalization\nleads to greater integration of world economies, the world after the\nBrundtland report has seen greater fragmentation among viewpoints,\nwhere critics of globalization have generally used the concept of\nsustainability in a plurality of different ways (Sneddon, Howarth and\nNorgaard 2006).  Some have argued that “sustainability”, just like the\nword “nature” itself, has come to mean very different things, carrying\ndifferent symbolic meaning for different groups, and reflecting very\ndifferent interests (Redclift 2004, 220).  For better or for worse,\nsuch ambiguity can on occasion allow different parties in negotiations\nto claim a measure of agreement. \nThe preservation of opportunities to live well, or at least to have a\nminimally acceptable level of well being, is at the heart of\n population ethics\n and many contemporary conceptions of\nsustainability. Many people believe such opportunities for the\nexisting younger generations, and also for the yet to arrive future\ngenerations, to be under threat from continuing environmental\ndestruction, including loss of fresh water resources, continued\nclearing of wild areas and a changing climate.  Of these, climate\nchange has come to prominence as an area of intense policy and\npolitical debate, to which applied philosophers and ethicists have\nmuch to contribute.  An early exploration of the topic by John Broome\nshows how the economics of climate change could not be divorced from\nconsiderations of intergenerational justice and ethics (Broome 1992),\nand this has set the scene for subsequent discussions and\nanalyses. More than a decade later, when Stephen Gardiner analyses the\nstate of affairs surrounding climate change in an article entitled “A\nPerfect Moral Storm” (Gardiner 2006), his starting point is also that\nethics plays a fundamental role in all discussions of climate\npolicy. But he argues that even if difficult ethical and conceptual\nquestions facing climate change (such as the so-called\n “non-identity problem”\nalong with the notion of\n historic injustices)\n could be answered, it would still be close to\npolitically and socially impossible to formulate, let alone to\nenforce, policies and action plans to deal effectively with climate\nchange. This is due to the multi-faceted nature of a problem that\ninvolves vast numbers of agents and players.  At a global level, there\nis first of all the practical problem of motivating shared\nresponsibilities (see the entry on \n moral motivation) \nin part due to the dispersed nature of greenhouse gas\nemissions which makes the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric\ncarbon and methane not always felt most strongly in the regions where\nthey originate. Add to this the fact that there is an un-coordinated\nand also dispersed network of agents—both individual and \ncorporate—responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and that there are no\neffective institutions that can control and limit them.  But this\ntangle of issues constitutes, Gardiner argues, only one strand in the\nskein of quandaries that confronts us.  There is also the fact that by\nand large only future generations will carry the brunt of the impacts\nof climate change, explaining why current generations have no strong\nincentive to act.  Finally, it is evident that our current mainstream\npolitical, economic, and ethical models are not up to the task of\nreaching global consensus, and in many cases not even national\nconsensus, on how best to design and implement fair climate\npolicies.   These considerations lead Gardiner to take a pessimistic view of\nthe prospects for progress on climate issues.  His view includes\npessimism about technical solutions, such as geoengineering as the\nantidote to climate problems, echoing the concerns of others that\nfurther domination of and large scale interventions in nature may turn\nout to be a greater evil than enduring a climate catastrophe (Gardiner\n2011, ch 11, Jamieson 1996). A key point in Gardiner’s analysis\nis that the problem of climate change involves a tangle of issues, the\ncomplexity of which conspires to encourage buck-passing, weakness of\nwill, distraction and procrastination , “mak[ing] us extremely\nvulnerable to moral corruption” (ibid., 397; cf. Gardiner 2011;\nalso see the concept of “wicked problem” in Brennan\n2004). Because of the grave risk of serious harms to future\ngenerations, our failure to take timely mitigating actions on climate\nisseus can be seen as a serious moral failing, especially in the light\nof our current knowledge and understanding of the problem. Summarizing\nwidespread frustration over the issue, Rolston writes: “All this\ninability to act effectively in the political arena casts a long\nshadow of doubt on whether, politically or technologically, much less\nethically, we humans are anywhere near being smart enough to manage\nthe planet” (Rolston 2012, 216).  In the face of such pessimism\nabout the prospects for securing any action to combat climate change\nother writers have cautioned against giving in to defeatism and making\nself-fulfilling prophecies. These latter behaviours are always a\ntemptation when we confront worrying truths and insufficient\nanswers. Whatever the future holds, many thinkers now believe that\nsolving the problems of climate change is an essential ingredient in\nany credible form of sustainable development and that the alternative\nto decisive action may result in the diminution not only of nature and\nnatural systems, but also of human dignity itself (see Nanda 2011,\nespecially chapters by Heyd, Balafrej, Gutrich and Brennan and\nLo).","contact.mail":"norvayslo@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
