Brouwer’s\nintuitionistic mathematics. A widespread misconception has it that\nintuitionistic logic is the logic underlying Brouwer’s\nintuitionism; instead, the intuitionism underlies the logic, which is\nconstrued as an application of intuitionistic mathematics to language.\nIntuitionistic mathematics consists in the act of effecting mental\nconstructions of a certain kind. These are themselves not linguistic\nin nature, but when acts of construction and their results are\ndescribed in a language, the descriptions may come to exhibit\nlinguistic patterns. Intuitionistic logic is the mathematical study of\nthese patterns, and in particular of those that characterize valid\ninferences. An inference rule is valid if, whenever the statements in\nthe premises describe truths of intuitionistic mathematics, a\nconstruction can be found that makes true the statement that is\nobtained by applying the rule. What the principles of logic need to\npreserve is therefore not, as in classical logic, mind-independent\ntruth, but mental constructibility. Various principles of classical\nlogic, most notably the Principle of the Excluded Middle, then become\ninsufficiently grounded, and certain classical theorems even\ncontradictory. The theorems in intuitionistic logic that formally\ncontradict classical theorems depend on elements of intuitionistic\nmathematics that are incompatible with classical mathematics; this\nillustrates how in intuitionism logic is based on mathematics and not\nthe other way around.\n\n\nThe systematic explanation and formalization of intuitionistic logic\nwas begun by Brouwer’s student Arend Heyting in 1928. An\n“explanation” here is an account of what one knows when\none understands and correctly uses the logical connectives. Since the\n1970s Heyting’s explanation and its variants are known as\n“the Proof Interpretation”, as the role played by\nmind-independent truth in explanations of classical logic is here\nplayed by proof. For Heyting, a proof was primarily a mathematical\nconstruction in Brouwer’s sense, and, secondarily, a linguistic\ndescription of it. But it turned out that a Proof Interpretation can\nalso be based on other notions of proof. The Proof Interpretation\nunderstood in a more general sense has found many applications outside\nits historical origin, notably in other constructive but\nnon-intuitionistic forms of mathematics, philosophy, computer science,\nand linguistics. This widening of the range of application was\npossible because the original Proof Interpretation depends mostly on\nthe fact that the intuitionistic notion of mathematical truth is of a\nverificationist nature, so that broadly verificationist theories in\nother domains allow for an analogous explanation of their logic.\n\n\nIn this article, the principal concern is with the development of the\nProof Interpretation within its original context of intuitionistic\nmathematics. Section 1 comments on terminology. Section 2 examines the\nbasis of Brouwer’s conception of logic in his early writings.\nSection 3 presents his later refinements and also his views on\nHilbert’s Program, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems,\nand the debate in the foundations of mathematics in the 1920s. Section\n4 discusses formalizations of intuitionistic logic, which had begun\neven before the Proof Interpretation had been made explicit, and\nbriefly looks at mathematical interpretations of the formalisms\nobtained. The explanation of the Proof Interpretation in\nHeyting’s writings from 1930 to 1956 is treated in section 5.\nThe sensitivity of intuitionistic logic to the exact conception of\nmathematical construction was at the root of strong objections to\nparts of the Proof Interpretation that arose from within intuitionism.\nThese are discussed in section 6. At the end, a short list is given of\ntopics that will be added in future updates.\n\n\nThe standard explanation of intuitionistic logic today is the\nBHK-Interpretation (for “Brouwer, Heyting, Kolmogorov”) or\nProof Interpretation as given by Troelstra and van Dalen in\nConstructivism in Mathematics (Troelstra & van Dalen\n1988: 9):  \nNotions such as “construction”, “presenting”\nand “transformation” can be understood in different ways,\nand indeed they have been. Similarly, there have been different ideas\nas to how one may justify that concrete instances of clauses H3 and H4\nindeed work for any (possibly hypothetical) proof of the antecedent.\nLogical principles that are valid on one understanding of these\nnotions may not be valid on another. As Troelstra and van Dalen\nindicate, it is even possible to understand these clauses in such a\nway that they validate the principles of classical logic (Troelstra\n& van Dalen 1988: 9, 32–33; see also Sundholm 2004 and Sato\n1997). In the context of the foundational programs of intuitionism and\nconstructivism, all notions are of course understood to be effective;\nbut even then there is room for differences of understanding. Such\ndifferences can have mathematical consequences. On some\nunderstandings, intuitionistic logic turns out formally to be a\nsubsystem of classical logic (namely, classical logic without the\nPrinciple of the Excluded Middle). But that is not the understanding\nof intuitionistic mathematicians, who, in analysis, have constructed\nintuitionistically valid instances of the schema \\(\\neg \\forall x(Px\n\\vee \\neg Px)\\), while classically there can be none (see the section\non\n Strong counterexamples and the Creating Subject (3.3),\n below).  \nTroelstra and van Dalen specify that the clauses H1–H6 go back\nto Heyting’s explanation from 1934 (hence “H”).\nHeyting’s aim had been to clarify the conception of logic in\nBrouwer’s foundational program in mathematics, which would\nmotivate adding the following clause:  \nIndeed, as we will see, a version of the Proof Interpretation is\nimplicit already in Brouwer’s early writings from 1907 and 1908,\nand was notably used by him in his proofs of the bar theorem from 1924\nand 1927, which predate Heyting’s papers on logic. We will\ntherefore begin our account of the historical development of\nintuitionistic logic with Brouwer’s ideas, and then show how,\nvia Heyting and others, the modern Proof Interpretation was arrived\nat.  \nAs Sundholm (1983: 159) points out, in the terms\n“BHK-Interpretation” and “Proof\nInterpretation” it would be appropriate to replace\n“Interpretation” by “Explanation”. For in a\nlogical-mathematical context, “interpretation” has come to\nrefer to the interpretation of one formal theory in\n another.[1]\n An interpretation of a formal system \\(U\\) in a formal system \\(V\\)\nis given by a translation \\('\\) of formulas of \\(U\\) to formulas of\n\\(V\\) that preserves\n provability:[2] \nFor the moment, we note that the BHK-Interpretation or Proof\nInterpretation is not an interpretation in this mathematical sense,\nbut is rather a meaning explanation; we will come back to such\ninterpretations and their difference from explanations in\n section 4.5.2\n below.  \nWhile accepting Sundholm’s point, we keep the terms themselves,\nconsidering that they have perhaps become too common to change.\n Section 5.3\n below is the appropriate place to explain our preference for\n“Proof Interpretation” over\n“BHK-Interpretation”.  \nThe name “Proof Interpretation” for the explanation that\nHeyting published in the 1930s and later seems to have made its first\nappearance in print only in 1973, in papers by van Dalen and Kleene,\npresented at the same conference (van Dalen 1973a; Kleene 1973).\nHeyting himself spoke simply of the “interpretation”\n(1958A: 107; 1974: 87) or “the intuitionistic\ninterpretation” (1958A: 110) of logic.  \nThe name “BHK-Interpretation” was coined by Troelstra\n(1977: 977), where “K” initially stood for\n“Kreisel” (because of Kreisel 1962), later for\n“Kolmogorov”, e.g., in Troelstra 1990: 6; \nthis replacement\nis, in keeping with Sundholm’s point, a correction.  \nIn his dissertation (1907), Brouwer presents his conception of the\nrelations between mathematics, language, and logic. Both the\nintuitionistic view of logic as essentially sterile, and the existence\nof results in intuitionistic logic that are incompatible with\nclassical logic, depend essentially on that conception.  \nFor Brouwer, pure mathematics consists primarily in the act of making\ncertain mental constructions (Brouwer 1907: 99n.1 [1975:\n 61n.1).[3]\n The point of departure for these constructions is the intuition of\nthe flow of\n time.[4]\n This intuition, when divested from all sensuous content, allows us to\nperceive the form “one thing and again a thing, and a continuum\nin between”. Brouwer calls this form, which unites the discrete\nand the continuous, “the empty two-ity”. It is the basic\nintuition of mathematics; the discrete cannot be reduced to the\ncontinuous, nor the continuous to the discrete (Brouwer 1907: 8 [1975:\n17]).  \nAs time flows on, an empty two-ity can be taken as one part of a new\ntwo-ity, and so on. The development of intuitionistic mathematics\nconsists in the exploration which specific constructions the empty\ntwo-ity and its self-unfolding or iteration allows and which not:  \nThe only possible foundation of mathematics must be sought in this\nconstruction under the obligation carefully to watch which\nconstructions intuition allows and which not. (Brouwer 1907: 77 [1975:\n52]) \nor, in Heyting’s words,  \n[Brouwer’s] construction of intuitionist mathematics is nothing\nmore nor less than an investigation of the utmost limits which the\nintellect can attain in its self-unfolding. (Heyting 1968A: 314) \nBrouwer and other intuitionists have shown how on this basis\narithmetic, real analysis, and topology can be constructed. Moreover,\nBrouwer considers any exact thought that is not itself mathematics an\napplication of mathematics. For whenever we consciously think of two\nthings together while keeping them separate, we do so, according to\nBrouwer, by projecting the empty two-ity on them (Brouwer 1907: 179n.1\n[1975: 97n.1]).  \nBrouwer takes the intuition of time to belong to pre-linguistic\nconsciousness. Mathematics, therefore, is essentially languageless. It\nis the activity of effecting non-linguistic constructions out of\nsomething that is not of a linguistic nature. Using language we can\ndescribe our mathematical activities, but these activities themselves\ndo not depend on linguistic elements, and nothing that is true about\nmathematical constructional activities owes its truth to some\nlinguistic fact. Linguistic objects such as axioms may serve to\ndescribe a mental construction, but they cannot bring it into being.\nFor this reason, certain axioms from classical mathematics are\nrejected by intuitionists, such as the completeness axiom for real\nnumbers, which says that if a non-empty set of real numbers has an\nupper bound, then it has a least upper bound: we know of no general\nmethod that would allow us to construct mentally the least upper bound\nwhose existence the axiom claims.  \nAs Brouwer later put it, “Formal language accompanies\nmathematics as a score accompanies a symphony by Bach or an oratorio\nby Handel”. (Brouwer et al. 1937: 262; translation\n mine)[5]\n Correspondingly, establishing properties of formal systems may have\nmany uses, but ultimately has no foundational significance for\nmathematics. In a lecture from 1923, Brouwer expresses optimism about\nHilbert’s proof theory, but denies that it would have\nsignificance for mathematics:  \nWe need by no means despair of reaching this goal [of a consistency\nproof for formalized mathematics], but nothing of mathematical value\nwill thus be gained: an incorrect theory, even if it cannot be\ninhibited by any contradiction that would refute it, is none the less\nincorrect, just as a criminal policy is none the less criminal even if\nit cannot be inhibited by any court that would curb it. (Brouwer\n1924N: 3 [van Heijenoort 1967: 336]) \nAt the same time, Brouwer was well aware of the practical need for\nlanguage, both in order to communicate mathematical results to others\nand to help ourselves in remembering and reconstructing our previous\nresults (Brouwer 1907: 169 [1975: 92]). Only an ideal mathematician\nwith perfect and unlimited memory would be able to practice pure\nmathematics without recourse to language (Brouwer 1933A2: 58 [van\nStigt 1990: 427]).  Clearly, given these two practical functions of\nlanguage, the more precise the language is, the better.  \nLogic, in this framework, seeks and systematizes certain patterns in\nthe linguistic recordings of our activities of mathematical\nconstruction. It is an application of mathematics to the language of\nmathematics. Specifically, logic studies the patterns that\ncharacterize valid inference. The aim is to establish general rules\noperating on statements about mathematical constructions such that, if\nthe original statements (the premises) convey a mathematical truth, so\nwill the statement obtained by applying the rule (the conclusion;\nBrouwer 1949C: 1243). What is preserved in an inference from given\npremises to a conclusion is therefore not, as in classical logic, a\nkind of possibly evidence-transcendent truth, but constructibility.\nThis view is quite explicit already in Brouwer’s dissertation\n(Brouwer 1907: 125–132, 159–160 [1975: 72–75, 88]),\nbut a more memorable passage is in the paper from 1908:  \nCan one, in the case of purely mathematical constructions and\ntransformations, temporarily neglect the presentation of the\nmathematical system that has been erected, and move in the\naccompanying linguistic building, guided by the principles of the\nsyllogism, of contradiction, and of tertium exclusum, always confident\nthat, by momentary evocation of the presentation of the mathematical\nconstructions suggested by this reasoning, each part of the discourse\ncould be justified? (Brouwer 1908C: 4 [van Atten & Sundholm 2017:\n40]) \n(He then goes on to argue that the answer is “yes” for the\nprinciples of the syllogism and of contradiction, but, in general,\n“no” for the Principle of the Excluded Middle (PEM); more\non this below,\n section 2.4.)\n  \nBut if a certain mathematical construction can be constructed out of\nanother one, this is a purely mathematical fact, and as such\nindependent of logic. Logic therefore is descriptive but not creative:\nby the use of logic, one will never obtain mathematical truths that\nare not obtainable by a direct mathematical construction (Brouwer\n1949C: 1243). Hence, in the development of intuitionistic mathematics,\nlogic can never play an essential role. It follows from\nBrouwer’s view that logic is subordinate to mathematics. The\nclassical view that mathematics is subordinate to logic is closely\nrelated to the view that pure logic has no particular subject matter\nor domain, and is prior to all. From that perspective, Brouwer’s\nconception of logic as dependent on mathematics will seem too\nrestrictive. But for Brouwer logic always presupposes mathematics,\nbecause in his view it is, like any exact thought, an application of\nmathematics.  \nThe resulting linguistic system of logic may in turn be studied\nmathematically, even independently of the mathematical activities and\ntheir recordings that it was originally abstracted from. Iterating the\nprocess, an infinite hierarchy arises of mathematical activities,\ntheir linguistic recordings, and the mathematical study of these\nrecordings as linguistic objects independently of their original\nmeaning. Brouwer describes this hierarchy (in more detail than we have\ndone here) at the end of his dissertation (Brouwer 1907: 173ff), and\ncriticizes Hilbert for not respecting it. Of particular interest is\nthe distinction Brouwer makes between mathematics and\n“mathematics of the second order” (Brouwer 1907: 99n.1,\n173 [1975: 61n.1, 94]), where the latter is the mathematical study of\nthe language of the former in abstraction from its original meaning;\nthis way, Brouwer made fully explicit the distinction between\nmathematics and (what became known as) metamathematics (e.g., Hilbert\n1923: 153). Later, Brouwer claimed priority for this distinction,\nadding in a footnote that he had explained it to Hilbert in a series\nof conversations in 1909 (Brouwer 1928A2: 375 [Mancosu 1998: 44n.1]).\n \nBrouwer realized (1907: 125–128 [1975: 72–73]) that the\nhypothetical judgement seems to pose a problem for his view on logic\nas described above. For what is peculiar to the hypothetical\njudgement, Brouwer says, is that there the priority of mathematics\nover logic seems to be reversed. Among the examples he refers to are\nthe proofs found in elementary geometry of the problems of Apollonius.\nHere is one of them: Given three circles, defined by their centers and\ntheir radii, construct a fourth circle that is tangent to each of the\ngiven three. The way this is usually solved is first to assume that\nsuch a fourth circle exists, then to set up equations that express how\nit is related to the three given circles, and then, via algebraic\nmanipulations and logic, arrive at explicit definitions of the center\nand radius of the required circle, and, from there, at corresponding\nmathematical constructions. So it seems that here one first has to\nassume the existence of the required circle, then use logic to make\nvarious judgements about it, and only thereby arrives at a\nmathematical construction for it.  \nHowever, Brouwer argues, this is not what really happens. His general\ninterpretation of such cases is as follows. Having first remarked that\nlogical reasoning accompanies or mirrors mathematical activity which\nis at least conceptually prior to that reasoning, Brouwer then says:\n \nThere is a special case […] which really seems to presuppose\nthe hypothetical judgment from logic. This occurs where a structure in\na structure is defined by some relation, without it being immediately\nclear how to effect its construction. Here one seems to\nassume to have effected the required construction, and to\ndeduce from this hypothesis a chain of hypothetical judgments. But\nthis is no more than apparent; what one is really doing in this case\nis the following: one starts by constructing a system that fulfills\npart of the required relations, and tries to deduce from these\nrelations, by means of tautologies, other relations, in such a way\nthat in the end the deduced relations, combined with those that have\nnot yet been used, yield a system of conditions, suitable as a\nstarting-point for the construction of the required system. Only by\nthis construction will it then have been proved that the original\nconditions can indeed be satisfied. (Brouwer 1907: 126–127\n[1975: 72; translation modified]) \nDifferent readings of this concise passage have been proposed.\nAccording to one, Brouwer’s passage bears on \\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\nin the following way:  \nAccording to interpretation \\(\\alpha\\), \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) just means\n\\(A \\wedge B\\) with the extra information that the construction for\n\\(B\\) was obtained from that for \\(A\\). On this reading \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) can be asserted only after a construction for \\(A\\)\nhas been found. The idea is clear: namely, to avoid hypothetical\nconstructions, and the use of logic they require, by insisting that a\nconstruction be supplied that proves the antecedent. (As will be\nexplained in\n section 6.2.1\n below, Freudenthal (1937b) too has suggested this strategy, albeit with a different\nmotivation than this passage in Brouwer’s dissertation.) But, as\nvan Dalen also notices, it is also in effect a rejection of the\nhypothetical judgement in the general case where one does not know\nwhether there is a construction for \\(A\\).  \nAn alternative reading is \\(\\beta\\):  \nOn this reading, Brouwer’s explanation of the hypothetical\njudgement avoids hypothetical constructions and the concomitant use of\nlogic by considering conditions on constructions instead of\nconstructions themselves. Instead of a “chain of hypothetical\njudgements” that one seems to make, one is really making a chain\nof transformations in which from required relations (i.e., given\nconditions) further relations are derived. It is, of course, a\nrequirement that these transformations preserve mathematical\nconstructibility, and that this preservation is itself intuitively\nknown. The role of conditions is explicit in a statement Brouwer made\nat the other end of his publishing career:  \n[T]he wording of a mathematical theorem has no sense unless it\nindicates the construction either of an actual mathematical entity or\nof an incompatibility (e.g., the identity of the empty two-ity with an\nempty unity) out of some constructional condition imposed on a\nhypothetical mathematical system. (Brouwer 1954A: 3) \nBrouwer speaks not of an incompatibility constructed out of a\nhypothetical mathematical system, but out of some condition on its\nconstruction.  \nBe that as it may, the preservation of constructibility from \\(A\\) to\n\\(B\\) is essential to both reading \\(\\alpha\\) and reading \\(\\beta\\),\nso on either it is clear that Brouwer had the Proof Interpretation of\nthe implication in mind already in 1907. For further discussion of\nBrouwer’s passage on the hypothetical judgement and the two\nreadings of it mentioned here, see Kuiper 2004, van Dalen 2004, van\nAtten 2009, and van Dalen 2008. \nIntuitionistically, to say that a proposition \\(A\\) is true is\nprimarily to say that we have effected a construction that is\ncorrectly described by \\(A\\); the proposition \\(A\\) is made true by\nthe construction. Idealizing to a certain extent, we say that \\(A\\) is\ntrue if we possess a construction method that, when effected, will\nyield a construction that is correctly described by \\(A\\). According\nto Brouwer, to say that a proposition \\(A\\) is false then must mean\nthat it is impossible to effect an appropriate construction; notation\n\\(\\neg A\\). Such an impossibility is recognized either immediately\n(e.g., the impossibility to identify 1 unit and 2 units) or mediately.\nIn the former case, one observes directly that an intended\nconstruction is blocked; it “does not go through” (Brouwer\n1907: 127 [1975: 73]). In the latter case, one shows that a\nproposition \\(A\\) is contradictory by reducing \\(A\\) to a known\nfalsehood, e.g., one shows that \\(A \\rightarrow 1=2\\) (Brouwer 1954A:\n3). In practice, one defines \\(\\neg A := A \\rightarrow 1=2\\) (and\nhence \\(\\neg 1=2\\) is seen as a particular case of \\(A \\rightarrow\nA)\\).  \nThe notion of “negation as impossibility” is known as\n“strong negation”. One speaks of the “weak\nnegation” of \\(A\\) to express that so far no proof of \\(A\\) has\nbeen found. This excludes neither finding a proof of \\(A\\) nor finding\na proof of \\(\\neg A\\) later. Clearly, then, to assert the weak\nnegation of \\(A\\) is not to assign a truth value besides true and\nfalse to it; Barzin and Errera’s claim (see\n section 4.3\n below) that its treatment of negation turns Brouwer’s logic\ninto a three-valued one is groundless. The distinction between weak\nand strong negation is important for the so-called “weak\ncounterexamples”.  \nAs the rules of logic operate on linguistic objects, and these\nlinguistic objects may be considered separately from the precise\nmathematical context in which they described a truth, it is possible\nto apply the rules of logic and obtain new linguistic objects without\nproviding a precise mathematical context for the latter. In other\nwords, the logical principles, which can be stated without specifying\nthe context in which they are applied, and thereby suggest\ncontext-independence, are for their correctness sensitive to the\ncontext. There is no general guarantee that logical principles which\nare valid in one context, will be equally valid in a different one.\nThis is what Brouwer means when he speaks of “the unreliability\nof the logical principles”, the title and theme of his seminal\npaper Brouwer 1908C; see also Brouwer 1949A: 1243.  \nIn that paper, Brouwer draws a consequence of his general view on\nlogic that he had overlooked in his dissertation: PEM, \\(A \\vee \\neg\nA\\), is not valid. Its constructive validity would mean that we have a\nmethod that, for any \\(A\\), either gives us a construction for \\(A\\),\nor shows that such a construction is impossible. But we do not have\nsuch a general decision method, and there are many open problems in\nmathematics. Brouwer states “Every number is finite or\ninfinite” as an example of a general proposition for which so\nfar no constructive proof has been found. As a consequence, he says,\nit is at present uncertain whether problems such as the following are\nsolvable:  \nIs there in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) a digit which occurs more\noften than any other one? \nDo there occur in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) infinitely many\npairs of equal consecutive digits? (Brouwer 1908C: 7 [van Atten &\nSundholm 2017: 44]) \nIn effect, Brouwer is saying that we can assert the weak negations of\nthe propositions expressed in these questions; hence, these\npropositions are so-called “Brouwerian counterexamples” or\n“weak counterexamples” to PEM. On the constructive reading\nof PEM, of course any as yet unsolved problem is a weak counterexample\nto PEM. Brouwer began to publish weak counterexamples to PEM in\ninternational journals only much later (1921A, 1924N, 1925E).  \nBrouwer remarks in the 1908 paper that the fact that PEM is not valid\ndoes not mean that it is false: \\(\\neg(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) implies \\(\\neg\nA \\wedge \\neg \\neg A\\), a contradiction. In other words, \\(\\neg \\neg(A\n\\vee \\neg A)\\) is correct. Brouwer concludes that it is always\nconsistent to use PEM but that it does not always lead to truths. In\nthe latter case, the argument that appeals to PEM establishes not the\ntruth, but the consistency of its conclusion. Brouwer proposes to\ndivide the theorems that are usually considered as proved into the\ntrue and the non-contradictory ones (Brouwer 1908C: 7n.2 [van Atten\n& Sundholm 2017: 44n.14]). That is not a suggestion that there are\nthree truth values, true, non-contradictory, false; for a\nnon-contradictory proposition might be proved one day and thereby\nbecome true.  \nA mathematical context in which PEM is valid, Brouwer points out, is\nthat of the question whether a given construction of finite character\nis possible in a given finite domain. In such a context there are only\nfinitely many possible attempts at that construction, and each will\nsucceed or fail in finitely many steps (for clarity, the phrasing here\nis not that of Brouwer 1908C but that of Brouwer 1955). So on these\ngrounds \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\) holds, where \\(A\\) is the proposition\nstating that the construction exists.  \nBrouwer ascribed the belief in the general validity of PEM to an\nunwarranted projection from such finite cases (in particular, those\narising from the application of finite mathematics to everyday\nphenomena) to the\n infinite.[6] \nIn his dissertation of 1907, Brouwer still accepted PEM as a\ntautology, understanding \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\) as \\(\\neg A \\rightarrow\n\\neg A\\) (Brouwer 1907: 131, 160 [1975: 75,\n 88]).[7]\n Curiously, he did realize at the same time that there is no evidence\nfor the principle that every mathematical proposition is either\nprovable or refutable (Brouwer 1907: 142n.3 [1975: 101]); this\nprinciple is the constructively correct reading of PEM. In the paper\nfrom 1908, he corrected his earlier understanding of PEM:  \nNow the principium tertii exclusi: this demands that every supposition\nis either correct or incorrect, mathematically: that of every supposed\nfitting in a certain way of systems in one another, either the\ntermination or the blockage by impossibility, can be constructed.\n(Brouwer 1908C: 5 [van Atten & Sundholm 2017: 42]) \nBrouwer continues this last quotation as follows: \nIt follows that the question of the validity of the principium tertii\nexclusi is equivalent to the question whether unsolvable mathematical\nproblems can exist. There is not a shred of proof for the conviction,\nwhich has sometimes been put forward [here Brouwer refers in a\nfootnote to Hilbert 1900] that there exist no unsolvable mathematical\nproblems. \nHere he seems to overlook that, constructively, there is a difference\nbetween the claim that every mathematical problem is solvable and the\nweaker claim that there are no absolutely unsolvable problems. The\nformer is equivalent to \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\), the latter to \\(\\neg \\neg(A\n\\vee \\neg A)\\); and Brouwer had demonstrated the intuitionistic\nvalidity of the latter in the same paper. Indeed, in the Brouwer\narchive there is a note from about the same period 1907–1908 in\nwhich the point is made explicitly:  \nCan one ever demonstrate of a proposition, that it can never be\ndecided? No, because one would have to so by reductio ad\nabsurdum. So one would have to say: assume that the proposition\nhas been decided in sense \\(a\\), and from that deduce a contradiction.\nBut then it would have been proved that not-\\(a\\) is true, and the\nproposition is decided after all. (van Dalen 2001b: 174n.a; translation mine) \nBrouwer never published this note. Wavre in 1926 gave the argument for\na particular case, clearly seeing the general point:  \nIt suffices to give an example of a number of which one does not know\nwhether it is algebraic or transcendent in order to give at the same\ntime an example of a number that, until further information comes in,\ncould be neither the one nor the other. But, on the other hand, it\nwould be in vain, it seems to me, to want to define a number that\nindeed is neither algebraic nor transcendent, as the only way to show\nthat it is not algebraic consists in showing that it is absurd that it\nwould be, and then the number would be transcendent. (Wavre 1926: 66;\ntranslation mine) \nThe explicit observation that \\(\\neg \\neg(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) means that\nno absolutely unsolvable problem can be indicated was made in Heyting\n1934: 16.  \nThree examples can be given that show that by the mid-1920s, Brouwer\nin practice worked with the hypothetical judgement and with the clause\nfor implication in the Proof Interpretation (which was published\nlater): an equivalence in propositional logic, the proof of the bar\ntheorem, and his reading of ordering axioms.  \nIn a lecture in 1923, Brouwer presented a proof of \\(\\neg \\neg \\neg A\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg A\\) (Brouwer 1925E: 253 [Mancosu 1998:\n 291]).[8]\n This equivalence is the one theorem in propositional logic that\nBrouwer ever published. The argument begins by pointing out that \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) implies that \\(\\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A\\) (because\n\\(\\neg B\\) is \\(B \\rightarrow \\bot\\) and the two implications can be\ncomposed because the consequent of the one is the antecedent of the\nother). It would not have been possible for Brouwer to make this\ninference if at the time it would have been among his proof conditions\nof an implication to have a proof of the antecedent, as then a proof\nof \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) would lead to a proof of \\(B\\) and thereby make\nit impossible to begin establishing the second implication by proving\nits antecedent \\(\\neg B\\).  \nLater, Brouwer pointed out the following consequence of the validity\nof \\(\\neg \\neg \\neg A \\leftrightarrow \\neg A\\): the proof method of\nreductio ad absurdum can be used to establish negative\npropositions \\(\\neg A\\) (Brouwer 1929A: 163 [Mancosu 1998: 52]). For\nif the assumption of \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) leads to a contradiction, that\nis, to \\(\\neg \\neg \\neg A\\), the equivalence allows one to simplify\nthat to \\(\\neg A\\). On the other hand, reductio ad absurdum\nin general cannot be used to establish positive propositions \\(A\\);\nthe derivation of a contradiction from the assumption \\(\\neg A\\) only\nleads to \\(\\neg \\neg A\\), which intuitionistically is weaker than\n\\(A.\\)  \nBrouwer’s bar theorem is crucial to intuitionistic analysis; for\na detailed explanation of the notions involved and of Brouwer’s\nproof, see Heyting 1956 (Ch. 3), Parsons 1967, and van Atten 2004b\n(Ch. 4). Here we will rather be concerned with the logical aspects.\n \nBrouwer’s proof of the bar theorem from 1924 (later versions of\nthe proof appeared in 1927 and in 1954) proves a statement of the form\n“If \\(A\\) has been demonstrated, then \\(B\\) is\ndemonstrable” (Brouwer 1924D1, 1927B, 1954A). This is evidently\nnot the same as an implication \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) understood as a\ntransformation of the proof conditions of \\(A\\) into those of \\(B\\),\nbecause in the former case there is the additional information that,\nby hypothesis, \\(A\\) has been demonstrated. In other words, we have,\nby hypothesis, a concrete proof of \\(A\\) at hand. (However, both are\nhypothetical judgements in the sense that neither requires that we\nactually have demonstrated \\(A\\).) It may be possible to exploit this\nextra information, and below it will be indicated how Brouwer did\nthis. (Heyting in 1956 chose to define implication in this stronger\nsense; see\n section 5.4\n below.)  \nThe statement in question can be rendered more specifically as  \nIf it has been demonstrated that tree \\(T\\) contains a set of nodes\nforming a bar, then it can be demonstrated that \\(T\\) contains a bar\nthat is\n well-ordered.[9] \nBrouwer first formulates a condition for any demonstration that may be\nfound of the proposition “Tree \\(T\\) contains a bar”. This\ncondition is that any demonstration of that proposition must be\nanalyzable into a certain canonical form. Brouwer then gives a method\nto transform any such demonstration, when analyzed into that canonical\nform, into a mathematical construction that makes the proposition\n“\\(T\\) contains a well-ordered bar”, true, thereby\nestablishing the consequent. This strategy clearly shows that\nBrouwer’s operative explanation of the meaning of \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) was a version of clause (H3) of the Proof\nInterpretation as formulated in the Introduction, if we understand\n“proof” in that clause as “demonstration”.\n \nA demonstration or concrete proof of the antecedent, be it an actual\nor a hypothetical one, is required to obtain a canonical form. The\nreason is that the existence of a canonical proof of a proposition\n\\(A\\) cannot be logically derived from the mere proof conditions of\n\\(A\\), as the form such a canonical proof takes may well depend on\nspecific non-logical details of mathematical constructions for \\(A\\).\n \nIn Brouwer’s proof of the bar theorem, the applicability of the\ntransformation method to any demonstration of the antecedent is\nguaranteed by the fact that the condition on such demonstrations that\nhe formulates is a necessary condition. Brouwer obtained this\nnecessary condition by exploiting the fact that on his conception,\nmathematical objects, so in particular trees and bars, are mental\nobjects; this opens the possibility that reflection on the way these\nobjects and their properties are constructed in mental acts provides\ninformation on them that can be put to mathematical use, in particular\nif this information consists in constraints on these acts of\nconstruction. This is how Brouwer arrived at his canonical form. In\neffect, Brouwer’s argument for the bar theorem is a\ntranscendental argument. On other conceptions of mathematics such\nconsiderations need not be acceptable, and indeed no proofs of the\n(classically valid) bar theorem are known in other varieties of\nconstructive mathematics (where bar induction is either accepted as an\naxiom, a possibility that Brouwer had also suggested (Brouwer 1927B:\n63n.7 [van Heijenoort 1967: 460n.7]), or not accepted, as in the\nMarkov School).  \nFor a more detailed discussion of this matter, see Sundholm and van\nAtten 2008. \nAround 1925, Brouwer introduced the notion of “virtual\nordering”. A (partial) ordering \\(\\lt\\) is virtual if it\nsatisfies the following axioms (Brouwer 1926A: 453):  \nIn a lecture course on Order Types in 1925, of which David van\nDantzig’s notes are preserved in the Brouwer Archive, Brouwer\ncommented: \nThe axioms II through V are to be understood in the constructive\nsense: if the premisses of the axiom are satisfied, the virtually\nordered set should provide a construction for the order condition in\nthe conclusion. (van Dalen 2008: 19) \nThis is a clear instance of the clause for implication in the Proof\nInterpretation. Note that Brouwer did not include this elucidation in\nthe published paper (1926A), nor in later presentations.  \nAs we saw above, in the paper from 1908 Brouwer had given weak\ncounterexamples to PEM. In the 1920s Brouwer developed a general\ntechnique for constructing weak counterexamples which also made it\npossible to widen their scope and include principles of analysis. The\ndevelopment began in 1921, when Brouwer gave a weak counterexample to\nthe proposition that every real number has a decimal expansion\n(Brouwer 1921A). The argument proceeded by defining real numbers whose\ndecimal developments are dependent on specific open problems\nconcerning the decimal development of \\(\\pi\\). Brouwer closed by\nobserving that, should these open problems be solved, then other real\nnumbers without decimal expansion can be defined (Brouwer 1921A: 210\n[Mancosu 1998: 34]). The general technique was made explicit in a\nlecture from 1923 (Brouwer 1924N: 3 and footnote 4 [van Heijenoort\n1967: 337 and footnote 5]) and reached its perfection with the\n“oscillatory number” method in the first Vienna lecture in\n1928 (Brouwer 1929A: 161 [Mancosu 1998: 51]). The method involves the\nreduction of the validity of a mathematical principle to the\nsolvability of an open problem of the following type: we have a\ndecidable property \\(P\\) (defined on the natural numbers) for which we\nhave as yet shown neither \\(\\exists xP(x)\\) nor \\(\\forall x\\neg\nP(x)\\). This reduction is carried out in such a way that it only uses\nthe fact that \\(P\\) induces an open problem of this type, and does not\ndepend on the exact definition of \\(P\\); that is, if the open problem\nis solved, one can simply replace it by another one (of the same\ntype), and exactly the same reduction still works. This uniformity\nmeans that, as long as there are open problems of this type at all\n(and this is practically certain at any time), there is no\nintuitionistic proof of the general mathematical principle in\nquestion. In the 1920s, Brouwer constructed weak counterexamples to\nthe following general mathematical propositions, among others (where\n\\(\\mathbf{R}\\) stands for the set of intuitionistic real numbers, and\n\\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) for the set of rationals):  \nA weak counterexample shows that we cannot at present prove some\nproposition, but it does not actually refute it; in that sense, it is\nnot a counterexample proper. From 1928 on, Brouwer devised a number of\nstrong counterexamples to classically valid propositions, that is, he\nshowed that these propositions were contradictory. This should be\nunderstood as follows: if one keeps to the letter of the classical\nprinciple but in its interpretation substitutes intuitionistic notions\nfor their classical counterparts, one arrives at a contradiction. So\nBrouwer’s strong counterexamples are no more counterexamples in\nthe strict sense of the word than his weak counterexamples are (but\nfor a different reason). One way of looking at strong counterexamples\nis that they are non-interpretability results.  \nThat strong counterexamples to classical principles are possible at\nall is explained as follows. As mentioned, on the intuitionistic\nunderstanding, logic is subordinate to mathematics, whereas\nclassically it is the other way around. Hence, if intuitionistic\nmathematics contains objects and principles that do not figure in\nclassical mathematics, it may come about that intuitionistic logic,\nwhich then depends also on these non-classical elements, is no proper\npart of classical logic.  \nBrouwer’s first strong counterexample was published in Brouwer\n1928A2, where he showed: \nThis is a strengthening of the corresponding weak counterexample from\n1923, but the argument is entirely different. The strong\ncounterexample depends on the theorem in intuitionistic analysis,\nobtained in 1924 and improved in 1927, that all total functions\n\\([0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\) are uniformly continuous. The\nnon-classical elements in that theorem are the conception of the\ncontinuum as a spread of choice sequences, and the Bar Theorem based\non it (for further explanations of this conception, see Heyting 1956\n(Ch.3) and van Atten 2004b (Chs.3 and\n 4)).[10] \nFrom 1948 on, Brouwer also published counterexamples that are based on\nso-called “creating subject methods”. (He mentions in\nBrouwer 1948A that he has been using this method in lectures since\n1927.) Their characteristic property is that they make explicit\nreference to the subject who carries out the mathematical\nconstructions, to the temporal structure of its activities, and the\nrelation of this structure to the intuitionistic notion of truth.\nThese methods can be used to generate weak as well as strong\ncounterexamples. (In the earlier “oscillatory number”\nmethod for generating weak counterexamples, the creating subject is\nnot explicitly referred to.)  \nUsing creating subject methods, Brouwer showed, for instance, \nThe actual arguments using these methods introduce no new\nlogical phenomena as such—weak and strong counterexamples can\nalso be given by other means. For the moment, we refer\nto the literature for further details: Brouwer 1949A, 1949B, 1954F;\nHeyting 1956: 117–120; Myhill 1966; Dummett 2000: 244–245.\nBut we do note here one particular aspect of this method. It seems to\nintroduce a further notion of negation, by accepting that, if it is\nknown that the creating subject will never prove \\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is\nfalse. But this is actually no different from the notion of negation\nas impossibility. Heuristically, this can be seen as follows: given\nthe freedom the creating subject has to construct whatever it can, the\nonly way to show that there can be no moment at which the subject\ndemonstrates \\(A\\) is to show that a demonstration of \\(A\\) itself is\nimpossible. An actual justification of the principle is this: If the\ncreating subject demonstrates a proposition \\(A\\), it does so at a\nparticular moment \\(n\\); so, by contraposition, if it is contradictory\nthat there exists a moment \\(n\\) at which the subject demonstrates\n\\(A\\), then \\(A\\) is\n contradictory.[11] \nIn Brouwer 1955, the four possible cases a proposition \\(\\alpha\\) may\nbe in at any particular moment are made explicit:  \nIn a lecture from 1951, Brouwer lists only cases 1, 2, and 4 from the\nabove list, adding that case 3 “obviously is reducible to the\nfirst and second cases” (Brouwer 1981A: 92). That remark\nemphasizes an important idealization permitted in intuitionistic\nmathematics: we may make the idealization that, once we have obtained\na decision method for a specific proposition, we also know its\noutcome.  \nBrouwer also adds that a proposition for which case 4 holds may at\nsome point pass to another case, either because we have in the\nmeantime found a decision method, or because the objects involved in\nproposition \\(\\alpha\\) in the meantime have acquired further\nproperties that permit to make the decision (as may happen for\npropositions about choice sequences).  \nIn 1908, Brouwer had shown that \\(\\neg \\neg(A \\vee \\neg A)\\); in 1923,\nwhen Hilbert’s program was in full swing, this result led\nBrouwer to say that “We need by no means despair of reaching\nthis goal [of a consistency proof for formalized mathematics]”;\nsee section 2.1 above for the\n full quotation.\n (At the time, Brouwer suspected that \\(\\neg \\neg A \\rightarrow A\\)\nwas weaker than PEM; Bernays quickly corrected this impression in a\nletter to Brouwer (Brouwer 1925E: 252n.4 [Mancosu 1998: 292n.4]).)\n \nIn 1928, he added to this the consistency of finite conjunctions of\ninstances of PEM, and considered these results to “offer some\nencouragement” for the formalist project of a consistency proof\n(Brouwer 1928A2: 377 [Mancosu 1998:\n 43]).[12]\n The strongest statement based on these results he made at the end of\nthe first Vienna lecture from 1928:  \nAn appropriate mechanization of the language of this\nintuitionistically non-contradictory mathematics should therefore\ndeliver precisely what the formalist school has set as its goal.\n(Brouwer 1929A: 164; translation mine) \nBut, for reasons explained above, such a consistency proof would have\nno mathematical value for Brouwer; and the best a classical\nmathematician can be said to be doing, according to the view Brouwer\nsketches, is to be giving relative consistency proofs.  \nGödel’s incompleteness theorems showed that Hilbert’s\nProgram, in its most ambitious form, cannot succeed. Brouwer’s\nassistant Hurewicz discussed the incompleteness theorem in a seminar\n(van Dalen 2005: 674n.7). There is no comment from Brouwer on\nGödel’s first theorem in print; on the other hand, he\nclearly had the second theorem in mind when he wrote, in 1952, that\n \nThe hope originally fostered by the Old Formalists that mathematical\nscience erected according to their principles would be crowned one day\nwith a proof of non-contradictority, was never fulfilled, and,\nnowadays, in view of the results of certain investigations of the last\nfew decades, has, I think, been relinquished. (Brouwer 1952B: 508) \nHao Wang reports:  \nIn the spring of 1961 I visited Brouwer at his home. He discoursed\nwidely on many subjects. Among other things he said that he did not\nthink G’s incompleteness results are as important as\nHeyting’s formalization of intuitionistic reasoning, because to\nhim G’s results are obvious (obviously true). (Wang 1987:\n 88)[13] \nWith respect to the first incompleteness theorem, Brouwer’s\nreaction is readily understandable. Already in his dissertation, he\nhad noted that the totality of all possible mathematical constructions\nis “denumerably unfinished”; by this he meant that  \nwe can never construct in a well-defined way more than a denumerable\nsubset of it, but when we have constructed such a subset, we can\nimmediately deduce from it, following some previously defined\nmathematical process, new elements which are counted to the original\nset. (Brouwer 1907: 148 [1975: 82])  \nAnd in one of the notebooks leading up to his dissertation, he stated\nthat “The totality of mathematical theorems is, among other\nthings, also a set which is denumerable but never\n finished”.[14] \nIndeed, according to Carnap, it had been an argument of\nBrouwer’s that had stimulated Gödel in finding the first\ntheorem. In a diary note for December 12, 1929, Carnap states that\nGödel talked to him that day  \nabout the inexhaustibility of mathematics (see separate sheet) He was\nstimulated to this idea by Brouwer’s Vienna lecture. Mathematics\nis not completely formalizable. He appears to be right. (Wang 1987:\n84)  \nOn the “separate sheet”, Carnap wrote down what Gödel\nhad told him:  \nWe admit as legitimate mathematics certain reflections on the grammar\nof a language that concerns the empirical. If one seeks to formalize\nsuch a mathematics, then with each formalization there are problems,\nwhich one can understand and express in ordinary language, but cannot\nexpress in the given formalized language. It follows (Brouwer) that\nmathematics is inexhaustible: one must always again draw afresh from\nthe “fountain of intuition”. There is, therefore, no\ncharacteristica universalis for the whole mathematics, and no\ndecision procedure for the whole mathematics. In each and every\nclosed language there are only countably many expressions.\nThe continuum appears only in “the whole of\nmathematics” … If we have only one language, and\ncan only make “elucidations” about it, then these\nelucidations are inexhaustible, they always require some new intuition\nagain. (As quoted, in translation, in Wang 1987: 50) \nThis record contains in particular elements from the second of\nBrouwer’s two lectures in Vienna, in which one finds the\nargument that Gödel refers to: on the one hand, the full\ncontinuum is given in a priori intuition, while on the other hand, it\ncannot be exhausted by a language with countably many expressions\n(Brouwer 1930A: 3, 6 [Mancosu 1998: 56, 58]).  \nThe second incompleteness theorem, on the other hand, must have\nsurprised Brouwer, given his optimism in the 1920s about the formalist\nschool achieving its aim of proving the consistency of formalized\nclassical mathematics (see the quotation at the beginning of this\nsubsection).  \nIn his final original published paper (1955), Brouwer was, in his own\nway, quite positive about the study of classical logic. After showing\nthat various principles from the algebraic tradition in logic (e.g.,\nBoole, Schröder) are intuitionistically contradictory, he\ncontinues:  \nFortunately classical algebra of logic has its merits quite apart from\nthe question of its applicability to mathematics. Not only as a formal\nimage of the technique of common-sensical thinking has it reached a\nhigh degree of perfection, but also in itself, as an edifice of\nthought, it is a thing of exceptional harmony and beauty. Indeed, its\nsuccessor, the sumptuous symbolic logic of the twentieth century which\nat present is continually raising the most captivating problems and\nmaking the most surprising and penetrating discoveries, likewise is\nfor a great part cultivated for its own sake. (Brouwer 1955: 116) \nBrouwer’s logic has played a role in the Grundlagenstreit (the\nFoundational Debate) only to the extent that this logic could be seen\nas a fragment of classical logic. Constructive logic in that sense was\na success, and it became fundamental to Hilbert’s Program as\nwell. On the other hand, phenomena specific to Brouwer’s full\nconception of logic, in particular the strong counterexamples, played\nno role in the Foundational Debate whatsoever. The main reason for\nthis may be that, in their dependence on choice sequences, they use\nobjects that are not acceptable in classical mathematics. (A more\nsubtle matter is whether they are acceptable in Hilbert’s\nfinitary mathematics. According to Bernays, Hilbert never took a\nposition on choice sequences (Gödel 2003a: 279), and more generally never\nread Brouwer’s papers (van Dalen 2005:\n 637).[15])\n In addition, Brouwer did not announce the existence of strong\ncounterexamples in a loud or polemical way; and when in 1954 he\nfinally did publish (in English) a paper with a polemical\ntitle—“An example of contradictority in classical theory\nof functions”—the Foundational Debate was, in the social\nsense, long over. Intuitionistic logic and mathematics had been widely\naccepted to the extent that they could be seen as the constructive\npart of classical mathematics, while the typically intuitionistic\ninnovations were ignored. It is not surprising, then, that the\npresentation of the strong counterexamples in the 1950s did not at all\nlead to a reopening of the debate. For further discussion of this\nmatter, see Hesseling 2003 and van Atten 2004a.  \nAs Brouwer was more interested in developing pure mathematics than in\ndeveloping logic, which for him was a form of applied mathematics, he\nnever made an extensive study of the latter. In particular, he never\nmade a systematic comparison of intuitionistic logic and classical\nlogic as formalized, for example, in Principia Mathematica\n(Whitehead & Russell 1910) or by the Hilbert school (Hilbert 1923;\nHilbert & Ackermann 1928). What motivated others to make such\ncomparisons was the publication by Brouwer in international journals\nof weak counterexamples that showed how these also affected very\ngeneral mathematical principles such as trichotomy for real numbers\n(see above,\n section 3.2).\n  \nClearly, to make a systematic comparison possible, one needs a\ncodification of intuitionistic logic in a formal system. On the\nintuitionistic view that cannot exist, as logic is as open-ended as\nthe mathematics it depends on. But one may formalize fragments of\nintuitionistic logic. The relevant papers here are Kolmogorov 1925,\nHeyting 1928 (unpublished), Glivenko 1928, Glivenko 1929, and Heyting\n 1930.[16]\n But perhaps the first to give systematic thought to the matter was\nPaul Bernays. In a letter to Heyting of November 5, 1930, he wrote:\n \nThe lectures that Prof. Brouwer at the time held in Göttingen\n(for the first time) [1924 (van Dalen 2001: 305)], led me to the\nquestion how a Brouwerian propositional logic could be separated out,\nand I arrived at the result that this can be done by leaving out the\nsingle formula \\(\\neg \\neg a \\supset a\\) (in your symbolism). I then\nalso wrote to Prof. Brouwer [correcting Brouwer’s impression at\nthe time that this formula is weaker than PEM]. (Troelstra 1990:\n 8)[17] \n(Bernays’ correction was included, at the proof stage, in\nBrouwer’s paper (1925E: 252n.4 [Mancosu 1998: 292n.4]).)\nHowever, Bernays did not publish his idea for a Brouwerian logic.\n(Kolmogorov would publish the same idea in 1925; see below.)  \nIn setting up a formal system to capture, albeit necessarily only in\npart, logic as it figures in Brouwer’s foundations, naturally\nsome priorly obtained meaning explanation is needed to serve as the\ncriterion for intuitionistic validity. Yet none of the papers by\nKolmogorov, Heyting, and Glivenko just mentioned made an explicit\ncontribution to the meaning explanation of intuitionistic logic. As we\nwill see, the explanations as given in the papers (which is not\nnecessarily all their respective authors had in mind) were too vague\nfor that. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the systems were\nnot equivalent; notably, Kolmogorov rejected Ex Falso, while\nHeyting and Glivenko accepted it. We will now discuss these papers in\nturn.  \nIn 1925, Andrei Kolmogorov, at the age of 22, published the first\n(partial) formalization of intuitionistic logic, and also made an\nextensive comparison with formalized classical logic, in a paper\ncalled “On the principle of the excluded middle”. As van\nDalen has suggested (Hesseling 2003: 237), Kolmogorov probably had\ncome into contact with intuitionism through Alexandrov or Urysohn, who\nwere close friends of Brouwer’s. Kolmogorov was in any case\nremarkably well-informed, citing even papers that had only appeared in\nthe Dutch-language “Verhandelingen” of the Dutch Academy\nof Sciences (Brouwer 1918B, 1919A, 1921A). \nThe task Kolmogorov set himself in the paper is to explain why\n“the illegitimate use of the principle of the excluded\nmiddle” as revealed in Brouwer’s writings “has not\nyet led to contradictions and also why the very illegitimacy has often\ngone unnoticed” (van Heijenoort 1967: 416). In effect, as other\npassages make clear (van Heijenoort 1967: 429–430), the\n(unachieved) aim is to show that classical mathematics is translatable\ninto intuitionistic mathematics, and thereby give a consistency proof\nof classical mathematics relative to intuitionistic mathematics.  \nThe technical result established in the paper is: Classical\npropositional logic is interpretable in an intuitionistically\nacceptable fragment of it. The intuitionistic fragment, called\n\\(\\mathbf{B}\\) (presumably for “Brouwer”) is: \nThe system \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) (presumably for “Hilbert”)\nconsists of \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) and the additional axiom  \nIn both systems, the rules are modus ponens and substitution.  \nKolmogorov then indicates and partially carries out a proof that\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is equivalent to the system for classical propositional\nlogic presented by Hilbert in Hilbert 1923. Then Kolmogorov devises\nthe following translation \\(^*\\): \nand proves this interpretability result:  \nwhere \\(U\\) is a set of axioms of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), and \\(U^*\\) the set\nof its translations (which Kolmogorov shows to be derivable in\n\\(\\mathbf{B})\\).  \nKolmogorov’s technical result anticipated Gödel’s and\nGentzen’s “double negation translations” for\narithmetic (see below), all the more so since he also made quite\nconcrete suggestions how to treat predicate logic. As Hesseling (2003:\n239) points out, however, to see Kolmogorov’s result as a\ntranslation into intuitionistic mathematics is slightly different from\nhis own way of seeing it. Kolmogorov saw it as a translation into a\ndomain of “pseudomathematics”; but although he did not\nexplicitly identify that as part of intuitionistic mathematics, he\ncould have done so.  \nKolmogorov’s strategy to obtain a (fragment) of formalized\nintuitionistic logic was to start with a classical system and isolate\nan intuitionistically acceptable system from it. (Note that, although\nKolmogorov refers to Principia Mathematica, he did not take\nit as his point of departure.) This might (roughly) be described as\nthe method of crossing out, which is also what Heyting would do in\n1928 (see below). Given the task Kolmogorov set himself, it is a\nnatural approach. Kolmogorov’s criterion whether to keep an\naxiom was whether a proposition has an “intuitive\nfoundation” or “possesses intuitive obviousness”\n(van Heijenoort 1967: 421, 422); on implication he said,  \nThe meaning of the symbol \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is exhausted by the fact\nthat, once convinced of the truth of \\(A\\), we have to accept the\ntruth of \\(B\\) too. (van Heijenoort 1967: 420)  \nNo more precise indications are given, so in that sense the paper did\nlittle to explain the meaning of intuitionistic logic.  \nEx Falso was excluded from this fragment: Kolmogorov said\nthat, just like PEM, Ex Falso “has no intuitive\nfoundation” (van Heijenoort 1967: 419). In particular, he says\nthat Ex Falso is unacceptable for the reason that it asserts\nsomething about the consequences of something impossible (van\nHeijenoort 1967: 421). Note that that is a very strong rejection: it\nnot only rules out Ex Falso in its full generality, but also\nspecific instances such as “If 3.15 is an initial segment of\n\\(\\pi\\), then 3.1 is an initial segment of \\(\\pi\\)”. It also\nindicates an incoherence in Kolmogorov’s position: one cannot at\nthe same time accept \\(A \\rightarrow (B \\rightarrow A)\\) as an axiom\nand deny that anything can be asserted about the consequences of an\nimpossible \\(B\\).  \nAs van Dalen notes, it is not known whether Kolmogorov sent his paper\nto Brouwer (van Dalen 2005: 555). The contents of the paper seem to\nhave remained largely unknown outside the Soviet Union for years.\nGlivenko mentioned the paper in a letter to Heyting of October 13,\n1928, as did Kolmogorov in an undated letter to Heyting of 1933 or\nlater (Troelstra 1990: 16); but in Heyting 1934 it is, unlike\nKolmogorov’s later paper from 1932, neither discussed nor\nincluded in the bibliography. The volume of the Jahrbuch über\ndie Fortschritte der Mathematik covering 1925, which included a\nvery short notice on Kolmogorov 1925 by V. Smirnov (Leningrad),\nwasn’t actually published until 1932 (Smirnov 1925).  \nWhile Kolmogorov’s work remained unknown in the West, an\nindependent initiative towards the formalization of intuitionistic\nlogic and mathematics was taken in 1927, when the Dutch Mathematical\nSociety chose to pose the following problem for its annual contest:\n \nBy its very nature, Brouwer’s set theory cannot be identified\nwith the conclusions formally derivable in a certain pasigraphic\nsystem [i.e., universal notation system]. Nevertheless certain\nregularities may be observed in the language which Brouwer uses to\ngive expression to his mathematical intuition; these regularities may\nbe codified in a formal mathematical system. It is asked to \nThe question had been formulated by Brouwer’s friend, colleague,\nand former teacher Gerrit Mannoury, who asked Brouwer’s opinion\non it beforehand in a letter (Brouwer was in\n Berlin);[18]\n unfortunately, no reply from Brouwer has been found, but the final\nformulation was the same as in Mannoury’s letter.  \nBrouwer’s former student Arend Heyting, who had graduated (cum\nlaude) in 1925 with a dissertation on intuitionistic projective\ngeometry, wrote what turned out to be the one submission (Hesseling\n2003: 274). The original manuscript seems no longer to exist, but it\nis known that its telling motto was “Stones for\n bread”.[19]\n In 1928, the jury crowned Heyting’s\n work,[20]\n stating that it was “a formalization carried out in a most\nknowledgeable way and with admirable perseverance” (Hesseling\n2003: 274; translation modified).  \nHeyting’s essay covered propositional logic, predicate logic,\narithmetic, and Brouwerian set theory or analysis. One would think\nthat, to be able to achieve this, Heyting must have had quite precise\nideas on how to explain the logical connectives intuitionistically.\nHowever, Heyting’s correspondence with Freudenthal in 1930 shows\nthat before 1930, Heyting had not yet arrived at the explicit\nrequirement of a transformation procedure in the explanation of\nimplication (see the\n quotation\n in\n section 5.1\n below).  \nSince the original manuscript seems not to have survived, a discussion\nof Heyting’s work must take the revised and published version\nfrom 1930 as its point of departure; see below.  \nHeyting sent his manuscript to Brouwer, who replied in a letter of\nJuly 17, 1928, that he had found it “extraordinarily\ninteresting”, and continued:  \nBy now I have already begun to appreciate your work so much, that I\nshould like to request that you revise it in German for the\nMathematische Annalen (preferably somewhat extended rather than\n shortened).[21] \nInterestingly, Brouwer also suggested (with an eye on the\nformalization of the theory of choice sequences)  \nAnd, with an eye on §13, perhaps also the notion of\n“law” can be formalized. \nIt seems, however, that Heyting made no effort in that direction.  \nHeyting’s paper would indeed be published soon after, in 1930;\nnot in the Mathematische Annalen, as Brouwer by then was no\nlonger on its editorial board, but in the proceedings of the Prussian\nAcademy of Sciences. However, Heyting’s work became known\nalready before its publication. Heyting mentioned it in correspondence\nwith Glivenko in 1928 (see below), Tarski and Łukasiewicz talked\nabout it to Bernays at the Bologna conference in 1928, and Church\nmentioned it in a letter to Errera in 1929 (Hesseling 2003: 274).  \nIn reaction to Barzin and Errera, who had argued that Brouwer’s\nlogic was three-valued and moreover that this led to it being\ninconsistent, Valerii\n Glivenko[22]\n in 1928 set out to prove them wrong by formal means. He gave the\nfollowing list of axioms for intuitionistic propositional logic:  \nFrom these axioms, he then proved  \nThe first two had already informally been argued for by Brouwer\n(1908C, 1925E); the third was new. Now suppose that in intuitionistic\nlogic, a proposition may be true \\((p\\) holds), false \\((\\neg p\\)\nholds), or have a third truth value \\((p'\\) holds). Clearly, \\(p\n\\rightarrow \\neg p'\\) and \\(\\neg p \\rightarrow \\neg p'\\), and\ntherefore \\((\\neg p \\vee p) \\rightarrow \\neg p'\\); but then, by the\nthird of the lemmata above and axiom \\ref{GlivAxiom8} \nin the list, \\(\\neg p'\\). As \\(p\\) is arbitrary, this means no\nproposition has the third truth value. (In 1932, Gödel would show\nthat, more generally, intuitionistic propositional logic is no\n\\(n\\)-valued logic for any natural number \\(n\\); see\n section 4.5.1\n below.) \nLike Kolmogorov in 1925 and, as we will see, Heyting in 1930, Glivenko\nprovided no detailed explanation of the intuitionistic validity of\nthese axioms.  \nGlivenko immediately continued this line of work with a second short\npaper, Glivenko 1929, in which he showed, for a richer system of\nintuitionistic propositional logic: \nThe first theorem is not a translation in the usual sense (as\nKolmogorov’s is), as it does not translate subformulas of \\(p\\);\nbut it is strong enough to show that the classical and intuitionistic\nsystems in question are equiconsistent.  \nThe system of intuitionistic propositional logic is richer than in\nGlivenko’s previous paper, because to its axioms have now been\nadded the following four: \nInterestingly, Glivenko mentions in his paper that “It is Mr. A.\nHeyting who first made me see the appropriateness of the two axioms C\nand D in the Brouwerian logic” (Mancosu 1998: 304–305n.3).\nThe two had come into correspondence when, upon the publication of\nGlivenko 1928, Heyting sent Glivenko a letter (Troelstra 1990: 11).\nKolmogorov in 1925 had explicitly rejected Ex Falso for\nhaving no “intuitive foundation”. From Glivenko’s\nletter to Heyting of October 13, 1928, we know that Glivenko was aware\nof this (Troelstra 1990: 12). In his paper, however, which he finished\nlater, he does not mention Kolmogorov at all. Instead, he makes the\nremark on Heyting just quoted and then justifies D by saying that it\nis a consequence of the principle \\((p \\vee \\neg q) \\rightarrow (q\n\\rightarrow p)\\), the admissibility of which he considers “quite\n evident”.[23]\n From a Brouwerian point of view, however, the principle is as\nobjectionable as Ex\n Falso.[24]\n It is worth noting that, when Heyting gave his justification for\nEx Falso in Heyting 1956: 102, he did not appeal to the\nprinciple Glivenko had used (nor did Kolmogorov in 1932). From\nGlivenko’s letter of October 18, 1928, one gets the impression\nthat this principle had not been the argument Heyting had actually\ngiven to convince him:  \nI am now convinced by your reasons that intuitionistic mathematics\nneed not reject that axiom, so that all considerations against that\naxiom might lead beyond the limits of our present subject matter.\n(Troelstra 1990: 12; translation mine) \nHeyting had informed Glivenko of the planned publication of his\n(revised and translated) prize essay from 1928 in the\nMathematische Annalen. On October 30, 1928, Glivenko asked\nHeyting if he also was going to include the result that if \\(p\\) is\nprovable in classical propositional logic, then \\(\\neg\\neg p\\) is\nprovable in intuitionistic propositional logic; for if he would, then\nthere would be no point for Glivenko in publishing his own manuscript.\nTwo weeks later, Glivenko had changed his mind, writing to Heyting on\nNovember 13 that, even though this result “is but an almost\ntrivial remark”, “its rigorous demonstration is a bit\nlong” and he wants to publish it independently of\nHeyting’s paper. Indeed, Glivenko’s paper was published\nfirst, and in it the publication of Heyting’s formalization was\nannounced; and when Heyting published his paper in 1930, he included a\nreference to Glivenko 1929, stating its two theorems, and he also\nacknowledged the use of results from Glivenko 1928. Heyting’s\nnote “On intuitionistic logic”, also from 1930, begins\nwith a reference to Glivenko’s “two excellent\narticles” from 1928 and 1929.  \nHeyting’s (partial) formalization of intuitionistic logic and\nmathematics in Heyting 1930, Heyting 1930A, and Heyting 1930B, is\nperhaps, as far as the parts on logic are concerned, the most\ninfluential intuitionistic publication ever, together with his book\nIntuitionism: An Introduction from 1956.  \nHeyting’s formalization comprised intuitionistic propositional\nand predicate logic, arithmetic, and analysis, all together in one big\nsystem (with only variables for arbitrary objects). The part concerned\nwith analysis was, not only in its intended interpretation (involving\nchoice sequences) but also formally, no subsystem of its classical\ncounterpart; this explains why it sparked no general interest at the\ntime. (A consequence we noted above is that Brouwer’s strong\ncounterexamples never affected the debate.) Therefore this part of\nHeyting’s formalization was left out of consideration by the\nother participants in the Foundational\n Debate.[25]\n This was different for the parts concerned with logic and arithmetic.\nFormally speaking and disregarding their intended interpretations,\nfrom these one could distill subsystems of their classical\ncounterparts, from which only PEM (or double negation elimination) is\nmissing. No doubt this encouraged many to accord to these systems a\ndefinitive character, which, as Heyting had remarked at the beginning\nof his paper, on the intuitionistic conception of logic they cannot\nhave:  \nIntuitionistic mathematics is a mental activity\n[“Denktätigkeit”], and for it every\nlanguage, including the formalistic one, is only a tool for\ncommunication. It is in principle impossible to set up a system of\nformulas that would be equivalent to intuitionistic mathematics, for\nthe possibilities of thought cannot be reduced to a finite number of\nrules set up in advance. Because of this, the attempt to reproduce the\nmost important parts of formal language is justified exclusively by\nthe greater conciseness and determinateness of the latter\nvis-à-vis ordinary language; and these are properties that\nfacilitate the penetration into the intuitionistic concepts and the\nuse of these concepts in research. (Heyting 1930: 42 [Mancosu 1998:\n311]) \nHowever, Heyting himself, however, wrote some five decades later,  \nI regret that my name is known to-day mainly in connection with these\npapers [Heyting 1930, 1930A, 1930B], which were very imperfect and\ncontained many mistakes. They were of little help in the struggle to\nwhich I devoted my life, namely a better understanding and\nappreciation of Brouwer’s ideas. They diverted the attention\nfrom the underlying ideas to the formal system itself. (Heyting 1978:\n15) \nThe fear that the attention might be thus diverted had indeed been\nexpressed in the first of the three papers themselves:  \nSection 4 [on negation] departs substantially from classical logic.\nHere I could not avoid giving the impression that the differences that\ncome to the fore in this section constitute the most important point\nof conflict between intuitionists and formalists (a claim that is\nalready refuted by the remark made at the beginning [quoted above]);\nthis impression arises because the formalism is unfit to express the\nmore fundamental points of conflict. (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998:\n313]) \nFor the full system, including predicate logic and analysis, the\nreader is referred to Heyting’s original papers. Heyting’s\naxioms for intuitionistic propositional logic were:  \nIn a letter to Oskar Becker, Heyting described the approach used to\nobtain these axioms, as well as those for predicate logic, as follows:\n \nI sifted the axioms and theorems of Principia Mathematica\nand, on the basis of those that were found to be admissible, looked\nfor a system of independent axioms. Given the relative completeness of\nPrincipia, this to my mind ensures the completeness of my system in\nthe best possible way. Indeed, as a matter of principle, it is\nimpossible to be certain that one has captured all admissible\nmodes of inference in one formal system. (Heyting to Becker, September\n23, 1933 (draft) [van Atten 2005: 129], original italics, translation\nmine) \nAs Heyting emphasizes here, the theorems of Principia\nMathematica also had to be looked at, for a theorem might be\nintuitionistically acceptable even when a classical proof given for it\nis\n not.[26]\n It is worth noting that Heyting used this method of crossing out, as\nalso Kolmogorov had, instead of determining the logic directly from\ngeneral considerations on mathematical constructions in\nBrouwer’s sense. (To some extent, Kreisel tried to do that\nsystematically in the 1960s.) \nIn his dissertation on intuitionistic\naxiomatization of projective geometry, Heyting had already gained\nexperience with developing an intuitionistic system by taking a\nclassical axiomatic system as guideline and then adjusting\n it.[27] \nIn Mints 2006 (section 2) it has been observed that Russell 1903\n(section 18) anticipated intuitionistic propositional logic by\nidentifying Peirce’s law and using it to separate out the\nprinciples that imply PEM. It seems that Heyting did not realize this\nat the time; among the references given in Heyting 1930,\nRussell’s book does not appear.  \nHeyting shows the independence of his axioms using a method given by\nBernays (1926); this use of a non-intended interpretation for\nmetamathematical purposes Heyting accepted without hesitation, but he\nremarked that such metamathematics is “less important for us\n[intuitionists]” than the approach where all formulas are\nconsidered to be meaningful propositions (Heyting 1930: 43 [Mancosu\n1998: 312]).  \nHeyting states Glivenko’s two theorems from 1929, without giving\nproofs.  \nUnlike Kolmogorov, but like Glivenko (who had been convinced by\nHeyting), Heyting accepted Ex Falso (axiom\n\\ref{HeytingAxiom10} above). He was somewhat more elaborate on this\npoint than they had been:  \nThe formula \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) generally means: “If \\(a\\) is\ncorrect, then \\(b\\) is correct too”. This proposition is\nmeaningful if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constant propositions about whose\ncorrectness nothing need be known … The case if conceivable\nthat after the statement \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved in the\nsense specified, it turns out that \\(b\\) is always correct. Once\naccepted, the formula \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) then has to remain correct;\nthat is, we must attribute a meaning to the sign \\(\\rightarrow\\) such\nthat \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) still holds. The same can be remarked in the\ncase where it later turns out that \\(a\\) is always false. For these\nreasons, the formulas [\\ref{HeytingAxiom5}] and [\\ref{HeytingAxiom10}]\nare accepted. (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998: 313]) \nThe argument is, however, incomplete. It is uncontroversial that, once\n\\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved, it should remain so when\nafterward \\(\\neg a\\) is proved. But why should \\(a \\rightarrow b\\), if\nit has not yet been proved, become provable just by establishing\n\\(\\neg a\\)? (Johansson asked this in a letter to Heyting in\n 1935;[28]\n see\n section 6.1\n below). Clearly, then, further work needed to be done on the\nexplanation of intuitionistic logic.  \nAfter the publication of Heyting’s series of papers, three roads\ncould be taken, and indeed were (cf. Posy 1992):  \nBy and large, these three roads lead to very different areas, with\ncorrespondingly divergent histories, of which no unified account can\nbe expected. (However, in the Dialectica Interpretation, as proposed\nand understood by Gödel (1958, 1970, 1972), they came close to\none another.) \nIn accordance with the main theme of the present account, in\nthe remaining sections we will be concerned with the historical\ndevelopment of the meaning explanations. But a number of early\nhighlights of the formal turn must be mentioned here.  \nIntuitionistic propositional logic is not a finitely valued logic.\nGödel (1932) showed that Heyting’s system for\nintuitionistic propositional logic cannot be conceived of as a\nfinitely many-valued logic. Apparently unbeknown to Gödel, this\nconfirmed a conjecture of Oskar Becker (1927: 775–777).\nGödel’s result, which came soon after his incompleteness\ntheorem, led Heyting to write to him,  \nIt is as if you had a malicious pleasure in showing the\npurposelessness of others’ investigations … In the sense\nof economy of thought this work is certainly useful, and in addition\nto that comes the particular beauty of your short proof.\n[Heyting to Gödel, letter dated 24 and 26 November 1932.\n(Gödel 2003a: 67) \nPeano Arithmetic is translatable into Heyting Arithmetic. A seminal\ntheorem was obtained independently by Gödel (1933e) and by\nGentzen (withdrawn upon learning of Gödel’s paper): There\nis a translation \\('\\) from PA to HA\nsuch that \n(Gödel and Gentzen actually used Herbrand’s axioms for the\nnatural numbers (Herbrand 1931), but that is immaterial here.) The\nsame proofs serve to show that the same result holds for pure\npredicate logic. This completes and generalizes Kolmogorov’s\nresult from 1925, which at the time was known to neither Gentzen nor\nGödel (Gödel does cite Glivenko 1929). Gödel concluded\nthat  \nthe system of intuitionistic arithmetic and number theory is only\napparently narrower than the classical one, and in truth contains it,\nalbeit with a somewhat deviant interpretation. (Gödel 1933e: 37\n[1986: 295])  \nHeyting replied that “for the intuitionist, the interpretation\nis what is essential” (Heyting 1934: 18; translation mine).\nLater Gödel became, as Kreisel put it, “supersensitive\nabout differences in meaning” (Kreisel 1987a: 82). The\nGödel-Gentzen translation had an immediate application to the\nfoundational debate, in which besides the notion of existence the\nstatus of PEM had been the main issue (Hesseling 2003): the embedding\nof PA into HA shows that\nPA is consistent if and only if HA\nis. As Gödel observed, \nThe above considerations, of course, provide an intuitionistic\nconsistency proof for classical arithmetic and number theory. This\nproof, however, is not “finitary” in the sense in which\nHerbrand, following Hilbert, used the term. (Gödel 1933e:\n37–38 [1986:\n 295])[29] \nIndeed, according to Bernays (1967: 502), it was this fact that made\nit clear that intuitionism is stronger than Hilbert’s\nfinitism. \nInterpreting intuitionistic logic in a classical provability logic,\nGödel (1933f) presented a mapping \\('\\) of intuitionistic\npropositional logic PC to classical modal logic\nS4 such that \nFor more details on this result, see the section\nGödel’s Work in Intuitionistic Logic and\nArithmetic of Kennedy 2007, as well as Artemov 2001. \nAs pointed out by Troelstra (Gödel 1986: 299), at the time\nGödel certainly knew the content of Heyting 1931. He had attended\nthe Königsberg conference (where Heyting had presented that\npaper) and had published a review (Gödel 1932f) of the printed\nversion. In that paper, Heyting had introduced a provability operator,\nbut considered it redundant given the intuitionistic conception of\ntruth as provability (see below,\n section 5.1).[30] \nVarious mathematical interpretations (in the sense explained in\n section 1.2)\n of formalized intuitionistic logic and arithmetic have been proposed.\nAbove we saw Gödel’s translation of intuitionistic\npropositional logic into the classical modal logic S4\nfrom 1933; further examples are Kleene’s realizability (Kleene\n1945), and Gödel’s Dialectica Interpretation (Gödel\n1958, 1970, 1972). \n \nSuch mathematical interpretations are not meaning explanations. There\nare two arguments. The first is that, in a context where formal\nsystems are arithmetized, interpretability results are established\nwholly within mathematics (e.g., Joosten 2004). But then no contact at\nall is made with the concepts that figure in meaning explanations,\nwhich have to do with our cognitive capacities, such as those of\neffecting mathematical constructions or those of understanding,\nlearning, and using a language. The second, more general argument is\ndue to Sundholm (1983: 159). Here we consider \\(A\\) and its\ninterpretation \\(A'\\) not as syntactical objects but as meaningful\npropositions. Then the argument is that, by whatever means one\ncorrelates a mathematical proposition \\(A'\\) to a mathematical\nproposition \\(A\\), it makes sense to ask whether the propositions\n\\(A\\) and \\(A'\\) are equivalent. On the other hand, it does not make\nsense to ask whether the proposition \\(A\\) is equivalent to a\nspecification of what one has to know in order to understand \\(A\\) and\nuse it correctly; for example, that specification remains the same\nwhether \\(A\\) is true, false, or undecided. But then \\(A'\\) cannot be\na meaning explanation of \\(A\\).  \nIt would therefore be a mistake to see in mathematical interpretations\nof intuitionistic systems ways to make the Proof Interpretation\n“rigorous” or “precise”. The difference is not\none of degree but of\n kind.[31]\n The point is general, and it makes no difference if the interpreting\ntheory \\(V\\) is\n intuitionistic.[32]\n On the other hand, it is not at all ruled out that for an\ninterpreting theory \\(V\\) itself an explanation can be given that is\narguably superior to the Proof Interpretation in some respect; this\nwas Gödel’s philosophical aim for his Dialectica\nInterpretation. \n \nA related point can be made about model-theoretic semantics for a(ny)\nlogic (Dummett 1973: 293–294): these map formulas to\nmathematical objects, without there being an intrinsic connection\nbetween those objects and the concepts related to our understanding\nand use of a language. By itself, therefore, such a semantics does not\ncontribute to a meaning explanation. (The first argument on\nmathematical interpretations, above, is essentially the same as this\none.) But for metamathematical purposes, such model-theoretic\nsemantics have proved extremely valuable. Note that Heyting (1930)\nused model-theoretic semantics to show the independence of his axioms\nfor propositional logic. A wide variety of model-theoretic semantics\nfor intuitionistic systems has been developed since, beginning with\nthe topological ones of Stone (1937) and Tarski (1938). Of the\nremaining ones, among the best known are Beth models (Beth 1956),\nKripke models (Kripke 1965), and topos models. For Kripke models, see\nthe section Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic of\nMoschovakis 2007; for other models and further references, see Kleene\nand Vesley 1965: 6 and Artemov 2001.  \nHeyting told van Dalen that he had the notion of (intuitionistic)\nconstruction in mind to guide him in devising his formalization of\nintuitionistic logic and mathematics in 1927. In the published version\nof his formalization, he did not elaborate much on the meaning of the\nconnectives; all he explained there about the general meaning of \\(a\n\\rightarrow b\\) was that “If \\(a\\) is correct, then \\(b\\) is\ncorrect too” (Heyting 1930: 44 [Mancosu 1998: 313]).\nCorrespondence between Heyting and Freudenthal in 1930 shows that\nHeyting up till then did not have a more refined explanation at hand;\nwe will come back to this later in this section.  \nHeyting began to expound on the meaning of the connectives in print in\ntwo papers written in 1930. The first, Heyting 1930C, was published\nthat same year, the second, the text of his lecture at Königsberg\nin September 1930, was published the next year (Heyting 1931).  \nThe first paper was a reaction to Barzin and Errera’s claim that\nBrouwer’s logic is three-valued (Barzin & Errera 1927). The\nrelevant points for the explanation of the meaning of the connectives\nin Heyting’s paper are the following. First, an explanation is\ngiven of assertion:  \nHere, then, is the Brouwerian assertion of \\(p\\): It is\nknown how to prove p. We will denote this by \\(\\vdash p\\). The\nwords “to prove” must be taken in the sense of “to\nprove by construction”. [original italics](Heyting 1930C: 959\n[Mancosu 1998: 307]) \nAnd then of intuitionistic negation:  \n\\(\\vdash \\neg p\\) will mean: “It is known how to reduce \\(p\\) to\na contradiction”. (Heyting 1930C: 960 [Mancosu 1998: 307]) \nHeyting goes on to explain that, although on these explanations there\nis a third case beside \\(\\vdash p\\) and \\(\\vdash \\neg p\\), namely the\ncase where one knows neither how to prove \\(p\\) nor how to refute it,\nthis does not mean there is a third truth value:  \nThis case could be denoted by \\(p'\\), but it must be realized that\n\\(p'\\) will hardly ever be a definitive statement, since it is\nnecessary to take into account the possibility that the proof of\neither \\(p\\) or \\(\\neg p\\) might one day succeed. If one does not wish\nto risk having to retract what one has said, in the case \\(p'\\) one\nshould not state anything at all. (Heyting 1930C: 960 [Mancosu 1998:\n307]) \nThis refutes the contention of Barzin and Errera. Note that these\npoints are all in Brouwer’s writings, too. Indeed, Heyting\n(1932: 121) objects to Barzin and Errera’s term\n“Heyting’s logic”, saying that “all the\nfundamental ideas of that logic come from Brouwer” (translation\nmine). But Heyting’s papers will have found a wider audience\nthan Brouwer’s. Brouwer, in turn, was very positive about the\npaper Heyting 1930C, and wrote to the editor of the journal in which\nit appeared (Brouwer to de Donder, October 9, 1930):  \nWhile preparing a note on intuitionism for the Bulletin de\nl’Académie Royale de\n Belgique,[33]\n I was pleasantly surprised to see the publication of a note by my\nstudent Mr. Heyting, which elucidates in a magisterial manner the\npoints that I wanted to shed light upon myself. I believe that after\nHeyting’s note little remains to be said. (van Dalen 2005:\n676) \nHeyting also proposes a provability operator +, where \\(+p\\) means\n“\\(p\\) is provable”. The distinction between \\(p\\) and\n\\(+p\\) is relevant if one believes that (at least some) propositions\nare true or false independently of our mathematical activity. In that\ncase one can go on and develop a provability logic, as for example\nGödel did (see\n section 4.5.1\n above). That is not the intuitionistic conception, and Heyting\nremarks that, if the fulfillment of \\(p\\) requires a construction,\nthen there is no difference between \\(p\\) and \\(+p\\). He adds that, on\nthe intuitionistic explanation of negation, there is indeed no\ndifference between \\(\\neg p\\) and \\(+\\neg p\\), as a proof of \\(\\neg\np\\) is defined as a construction that reduces \\(p\\) to a\ncontradiction. But Heyting does not generalize this remark to all of\nintuitionistic logic. The final section of the paper is a further\ndiscussion of the logic of the provability operator, in particular its\ninteraction with negation (e.g., \\(\\vdash \\neg +p\\) is the assertion\nthat \\(p\\) is unprovable). But Heyting ends by saying that, as the\nintuitionists’ task is the reconstruction of all mathematics,\nwhile at the same time no examples of propositions have been found so\nfar for which this provability operator would be necessary to express\ntheir status (e.g., to express absolute undecidability), it cannot be\nasked of intuitionists that they develop this logic (Heyting 1930C:\n963 [Mancosu 1998: 309–310]) \nThe Königsberg lecture, given in 1930 and published in 1931,\nspecifies the meanings of \\(p, \\neg p\\), and \\(p \\vee q\\). This time\nHeyting makes an explicit connection to phenomenology:  \nWe here distinguish between propositions [Aussagen] and\nassertions [Sätze]. An assertion is the affirmation of a\nproposition. A mathematical proposition expresses a certain\nexpectation. For example, the proposition, “Euler’s\nconstant \\(C\\) is rational”, expresses the expectation that we\ncould find two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(C = a / b\\).\nPerhaps the word “intention”, coined by the\nphenomenologists, expresses even better what is meant here …\nThe affirmation of a proposition means the fulfillment of an\nintention. (Heyting 1931: 113 [Benacerraf & Putnam 1983:\n58–59]) \nCompared to the earlier paper written in 1930, the point about the\nprovability operator is amplified:  \nThe distinction between \\(p\\) and \\(+p\\) vanishes as soon a\nconstruction is intended in \\(p\\) itself, for the possibility of a\nconstruction can be proved only by its actual execution. If we limit\nourselves to those propositions which require a construction, the\nlogical function of provability does not arise at all. We can impose\nthis restriction by treating only propositions of the form\n“\\(p\\) is provable”, or, to put it another way, by\nregarding every intention as having the intention of a construction\nfor its fulfillment added to it. It is in this sense that\nintuitionistic logic, insofar as it has been developed up to now\nwithout using the function +, must be understood. (Heyting 1931: 115\n[Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 60; translation modified]) \nThe explanation of disjunction in the Königsberg lecture is:  \n“\\(p \\vee q\\)” signifies that intention which is fulfilled\nif and only if at least one of the intentions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is\nfulfilled. (Heyting 1931: 114 [Benacerraf & Putnam 1983: 59]) \nAnd of negation:  \nBecker, following Husserl, has described its meaning very clearly. For\nhim negation is something thoroughly positive, viz., the intention of\na contradiction contained in the original intention. The proposition\n“\\(C\\) is not rational”, therefore, signifies the\nexpectation that one can derive a contradiction from the assumption\n[Annahme] that \\(C\\) is rational. It is important to note\nthat the negation of a proposition always refers to a proof procedure\nwhich leads to the contradiction, even if the original proposition\nmentions no proof procedure. (Heyting 1931: 113 [Benacerraf &\nPutnam 1983: 59]) \nHeyting pointed out that these explanations for disjunction and\nnegation, taken together, are an immediate argument against the\nacceptability of PEM, for which a general method would be needed that,\napplied to any given proposition \\(p\\), produces either a proof of\n\\(p\\) or a proof of \\(\\neg p\\). What Heyting did not do here was to\ngeneralize this explanation of negation to one for implication. Also,\nnote that the procedure does not operate on proofs of \\(p\\), but\nstarts from merely the assumption that \\(p\\), which in general gives\nless information. Both points were taken care of shortly afterward. In\na letter to Freudenthal dated October 25, 1930, shortly after the\nKönigsberg lecture, Heyting wrote:  \nFrom your remarks it has become clear to me that the simple\nexplanation of \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) by “When I think \\(a\\), I\nmust think \\(b\\)” is untenable; this idea is in any case too\nindeterminate to be able to serve as the foundation for a logic. But\nalso your formulation: “When \\(a\\) has been proved, so has\n\\(b\\)”, is not wholly satisfactory to me; when I ask myself what\nyou may mean by that, I believe that also \\(a \\rightarrow b\\), like\nthe negation, should refer to a proof procedure: “I possess a\nconstruction that derives from every proof of \\(a\\) a proof of\n\\(b\\)”. In the following, I will keep to this interpretation.\nThere is therefore no difference between \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) and \\(+a\n\\rightarrow +b\\). (Troelstra 1983: 206–207; translation\nmine) \nThis explanation of implication, which is the one that became\nstandard, would be introduced in print only in Heyting 1934: 14; in\nhis paper 1932C, Heyting used the explanation given in Kolmogorov 1932\ninstead (see below).  \nNeither of these two papers by Heyting contained an argument for the\nvalidity of Ex Falso.  \nA number of influences (or possible influences) on Heyting’s\narriving at the Proof Interpretation can be suggested. The following\nare publications Heyting had all seen by 1927, for he refers to them\nin his dissertation (1925: 93–94):  \nA further likely influence is Brouwer’s unpublished elucidation\nof the virtual ordering axioms (see\n section 3.1.3\n above). Dirk van Dalen (personal communication) suspects that,\nalthough Heyting was probably not present at this lecture course, he\nheard Brouwer make a similar comment on another occasion (for example\nduring the years 1922–1925, when Heyting was working on his\ndissertation under Brouwer, for that work also considers\nintuitionistic orderings).  \nIn 1932, Kolmogorov presented a logic of problems and their solutions,\nand pointed out that the logic this explanation validates is formally\nequivalent to the intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic\npresented by Heyting in 1930. Moreover, he suggests that this provides\na better interpretation than Heyting’s.  \nKolmogorov’s idea is this: \nIf \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are two problems, then \\(a \\wedge b\\) designates\nthe problem “to solve both problems \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)”,\nwhile \\(a \\vee b\\) designates the problem “to solve at least one\nof the problems \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)”. Furthermore, \\(a \\supset b\\)\nis the problem “to solve \\(b\\) provided that the solution for\n\\(a\\) is given” or, equivalently, “to reduce the solution\nof \\(b\\) to the solution of \\(a\\)” \\(\\ldots \\neg a\\) designates\nthe problem “to obtain a contradiction provided that the\nsolution of \\(a\\) is given” \\(\\ldots(x)a(x)\\) stands in general\nfor the problem “to give a general method for the solution of\n\\(a(x)\\) for every single value of \\(x\\)”. (Kolmogorov 1932: 59\n[Mancosu 1998: 329]) \nHe then lists Heyting’s axioms for propositional logic (with\nHeyting’s numbering) and, by discussing an example, makes it\nclear that these all hold when interpreted as statements about\nproblems and their solutions. He also points out that \\(a \\vee \\neg\na\\) is the problem  \nto give a general method that allows, for every problem \\(a\\), either\nto find a solution for \\(a\\), or to infer a contradiction from the\nexistence of a solution for \\(a\\)! \nIn particular, if the problem \\(a\\) consists in the proof of a\nproposition, then one must possess a general method either to prove or\nto reduce to a contradiction any proposition. (Kolmogorov 1932: 63\n[Mancosu 1998: 332]). \nIn the second part of his paper, Kolmogorov argues that, given the\nepistemological tenets of intuitionism,  \nintuitionistic logic should be replaced by the calculus of problems,\nfor its objects are in reality not theoretical propositions but rather\nproblems. (Kolmogorov 1932: 58 [Mancosu 1998: 328])  \nThat he considers his interpretation an alternative to\nHeyting’s, and a preferable one, is again emphasized in a note\nadded in proof:  \nThis interpretation of intuitionistic logic is closely connected with\nthe ideas Mr. Heyting has developed in the last volume of\nErkenntnis 2, 1931: 106 [Heyting 1931]; yet in Heyting a\nclear distinction between propositions and problems is missing.\n(Kolmogorov 1932: 65 [Mancosu 1998: 334]) \nBut it is not at all clear that Heyting would want to make that\ndistinction. If the notion of proposition is understood in such a way\nthat a proposition is true or false independently of our knowledge of\nthis fact, then Heyting would readily agree with Kolmogorov that a\nproposition is different from a problem; but as soon as one adopts the\nview that propositions express intentions that are fulfilled (i.e.,\nmade true) or disappointed (made false) by our mathematical\nconstructions, which is the view that Heyting actually held, then\nthere would seem to be no essential difference between propositions\nand problems. Kolmogorov himself had already indicated that a problem\nmay consist in finding the proof of a proposition; exploiting this,\none can argue that the following two notions of proposition coincide:\n \nThe basic idea is that a proposition in sense 1 gives rise to the\nproblem of finding a construction that fulfills the expressed\nintention, and that a solution to a problem posed in a proposition in\nsense 2 also serves to fulfill the intention towards constructions\nthat solve that problem; this is made fully explicit in a little\nargument due to Martin-Löf, given in detail in Sundholm 1983:\n158–159.  \nIn a letter to Heyting of October 12, 1931, Kolmogorov in effect\nagrees that the difference between Heyting and him is mainly a\nterminological matter (Troelstra 1990: 15).  \nHeyting later claimed that Kolmogorov’s meaning explanation and\nhis own amounted to the same (Heyting 1958C: 107). By 1937, Kolmogorov\nseems to have come to believe the same, as in a review in the\nZentralblatt of an exchange between Freudenthal and Heyting\n(discussed in\n section 6.1\n below), he consistently speaks of “intention or problem”\n(Kolmogorov 1937). In that exchange itself, Freudenthal (1937:\n114) had said that\nbetween Heyting’s and Kolmogorov’s explanations there was\n“no essential difference”. Finally, Oskar Becker, in a\nletter to Heyting of September 1934, had remarked that Heyting’s\ninterpretation is a generalization of Kolmogorov’s, as a\n“problem” and its “solution” are special cases\nof an intention and its fulfillment. “Intuitionistic logic is\ntherefore a ‘calculus of\n intentions’”.[34] \nHowever, a complication for the identification of Heyting’s and\nKolmogorov’s explanations of logic is introduced by\nKolmogorov’s also accepting, in a particular case, solutions\nthat do not consist in a carrying out a concrete construction.\nKolmogorov said that “As soon as \\(\\neg a\\) is solved, then the\nsolution of \\(a\\) is impossible and the problem \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) is\nwithout content” (Kolmogorov 1932: 62 [Mancosu 1998: 331]), and\nproposed that “The proof that a problem is without content\n[owing to an impossible assumption] will always be considered as its\nsolution” (Kolmogorov 1932: 59: [Mancosu 1998: 329]). Taken\ntogether, this yields a justification of Ex Falso, \\(\\neg a\n\\rightarrow(a \\rightarrow b)\\).  \nIt seems not altogether unreasonable to extend the meaning of the term\n“solution” this way, for, just like a concrete solution,\nan impossibility proof also provides what might be called\n“epistemic closure”: like a concrete solution, it provides\na completely convincing reason to stop working on a certain problem.\n(This kind of “higher-order” solution is also familiar\nfrom Hilbert’s Program, e.g., Hilbert 1900: 51.) Note that this\njustification of Ex Falso makes no attempt to describe a\ncounterfactual mathematical construction process; thus,\nKolmogorov’s justification from 1932 is not incompatible with\nthe ground for his rejection of Ex Falso in 1925, namely,\nthat one cannot constructively assert consequences of something\nimpossible. Rather, the solution from 1932 introduces a stipulation to\nachieve completion of the logical theory for its own sake.  \nOn the other hand, although Kolmogorov’s stipulation is neither\nunreasonable nor unmotivated, on Brouwer’s descriptive\nconception of logic there is of course no place for stipulation. For\nthis reason, “Proof Interpretation” seems to be a more\nappropriate name for an explanation of Brouwerian logic than\n“BHK Interpretation”.  \nOn Heyting’s explanation, however, a justification of Ex\nFalso parallel to Kolmogorov’s would seem to be impossible:\nwhile a problem may find a “higher-order” solution when it\nis shown that a solution is impossible, it makes no sense to say that\nan intention finds “higher-order” fulfillment when it is\nshown that it cannot be fulfilled. The notion of a solution seems to\npermit a reasonable extension that the notion of fulfillment does not.\nIn his book from 1934, Heyting explains Ex Falso in\nKolmogorov’s terms, not his own. After stating the axiom \\(\\neg\na \\supset (a \\supset b)\\), he says:  \nIt is appropriate to interpret the notion of “reducing” in\nsuch a way, that the proof of the impossibility of solving \\(a\\) at\nthe same time reduces the solution of any problem whatsoever to that\nof \\(a\\). (Heyting 1934: 15; translation mine) \nClearly there is a difference between Kolmogorov’s own\nexplanation and Heyting’s explanation in Kolmogorov’s\nterms. Where Heyting says that a proof of \\(\\neg a\\) establishes a\nreduction of the solution of any problem to that of \\(a\\), Kolmogorov\nhad said that it established that the problem of reducing the solution\nof any problem to that of \\(a\\) has become without content. One has\nthe impression that Heyting in his explanation of Ex Falso\ntries to approximate as closely as possible the explanation for\nordinary implications in terms of a concrete constructive connection\nbetween antecedent and consequent; this is even clearer in the\nexplanation he would give of Ex Falso in 1956 (see\n section 5.4\n below). (Note that neither Heyting nor Kolmogorov ever justified\nEx Falso by giving the traditional argument (based on the\ndisjunctive syllogism) also stated in Glivenko’s paper from\n1929; see\n section 4.3\n above.)  \nMore generally, the explanation of logic in Heyting 1934 is for the\nmost part given Kolmogorov style, and not Heyting’s own in terms\nof intentions and their fulfillment. (The latter is only mentioned for\nits explanation of the implication (Heyting 1934: 14).) Perhaps the\nreason for this is that Heyting (1934: 14) agrees with Kolmogorov\n(1932: 58) that the interpretation in terms of problems and solutions\nprovides a useful interpretation Heyting’s formal system also\nfor non-intuitionists (while for intuitionists they come to the same\nthing). In his short note 1932C, titled “The application of\nintuitionistic logic to the definition of completeness of a logical\ncalculus”, Heyting uses Kolmogorov’s interpretation\ninstead of his own. Given the subject matter, that is what one might\nexpect.  \nIn his influential book Intuitionism. An introduction from\n1956, Heyting explains the logical connectives as follows\n(97–98, 102):  \nNote that these explanations are not in terms of proof conditions, but\nof assertion conditions. This may make a difference in particular for\nthe explanation of implication, where, instead of only the information\nunder what condition something counts as a proof of \\(p\\), we now can\nalso take into consideration that, by hypothesis, a concrete\nconstruction for \\(p\\) has been effected. As we saw in\n section 3.1.2,\n the possibility to do so is crucial for Brouwer’s proof of the\nBar Theorem.  \nIn the same pages, Heyting also gave the following justification of\nEx Falso:  \nAxiom X [\\(\\neg p \\rightarrow(p \\rightarrow q)\\)] may not seem\nintuitively clear. As a matter of fact, it adds to the precision of\nthe definition of implication. You remember that \\(p \\rightarrow q\\)\ncan be asserted if and only if we possess a construction which, joined\nto the construction \\(p\\), would prove \\(q\\). Now suppose that\n\\(\\vdash \\neg p\\), that is, we have deduced a contradiction from the\nsupposition that \\(p\\) were carried out. Then, in a sense, this can be\nconsidered as a construction, which, joined to a proof of \\(p\\) (which\ncannot exist) leads to a proof of \\(q\\). (Heyting 1956: 102) \nOne easily recognizes Heyting’s effort to explain Ex\nFalso as much as possible along the same lines as other\nimplications, namely, by providing a concrete construction that leads\nfrom the antecedent to the consequent. In its attempt to provide,\n“in a sense”, a construction, the explanation is clearly\nnot of the same kind as Kolmogorov’s stipulation from 1932. But\nit does not fit into Heyting’s original interpretation of logic\nin terms of intentions directed at constructions and the fulfillment\nof such intentions either. For to fulfill an intention directed toward\na particular construction we will have to exhibit that construction;\nwe will have to exhibit a construction that transforms any proof of\n\\(p\\) into one of \\(q\\). But how can a construction that from the\nassumption \\(p\\) arrives at a contradiction, and therefore generally\nspeaking not at \\(q\\), lead to \\(q\\)? It will not do to say that such\na construction exists “in a sense”. A construction that is\na construction “in a sense”, as Heyting helps himself to\nhere, is no construction.  \nAs the Proof Interpretation became known, through personal exchanges\nand in print, a number of objections were made to it: \nAs mentioned in\n section 4.4\n above, Heyting’s axiomatization of implication was soon questioned\nby Johansson. Ingebrigt Johansson (1904–1987) was a Norwegian\nmathematician working mostly in geometry and topology. He had found a\nreference to Heyting’s “Die formalen Regeln” (Heyting\n1930) by\n accident.[35]\n “Having studied it carefully, I have become able to understand\nworks by Brouwer to some extent; before, that was impossible for\nme” (Johansson to Heyting, August 29, 1935; translation mine).\nHis concern over the acceptability of Ex Falso \n(axiom \\ref{HeytingAxiom10} above)\nled to a short correspondence from later 1935 to early\n 1936,[36]\n and resulted in the publication of “Der Minimalkalkül, ein\nreduzierter intuitionistischer Formalismus” (Johansson 1937) in\nBrouwer’s Compositio Mathematica. Here I will only discuss\nJohansson’s direct criticism of the Proof Interpretation; evidently,\nthis does not do much justice to his ideas that allowed him not only\nto criticize the Proof Interpretation but to turn that criticism into\nthe positive development of Minimal Logic.  \nJohansson announces his disapproval of the inclusion of Ex\nFalso in the opening letter but first formulates a precise\ncriticism in his second:  \nI have not been able to make my peace with Axiom 4.1. You say that\nwhen \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) has been proved, and later \\(\\neg a\\) is\nproved, then \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) should remain correct.\nIndeed; but \\(\\vdash \\neg a \\rightarrow \\cdot a \\rightarrow b\\) means\nthat when \\(\\neg a\\) has been proved, \\(b\\) at once becomes\nderivable from \\(a\\), even when this had not been proved before. And\nthat contradicts my intuition in the most violent way. (Johansson to\nHeyting, September 23, 1935; translation mine) \nMy being unwilling to accept 4.1 is in the end simply based on the\ncircumstance that I prefer to work with a more strict\nimplication. My Minimal Logic shows, however, that a more strict\nimplication really is possible. (November 15, 1935; translation\nmine): \n(The phrase “strict implication” is a reference to Lewis\n1914, which Johansson will cite in his article of 1937.) \nIn a note for his reply (and presumably also in the letter actually\nsent) Heyting explained:  \nI interpret \\(a \\rightarrow b\\) as “to reduce the solution of\n\\(b\\) to that of \\(a\\), or to show the impossibility of solving\n\\(a\\)”. This interpretation is appropriate. (Note by Heyting to\nJohansson’s letter of September 23, 1935; translation\n mine)[37] \nThis of course is Kolmogorov’s interpretation of 1932 (see\n section 5.3\n above).  \nIn 1955, in the French translation of his book\nGrundlagenforschung of 1934, Heyting adds a note saying that\nJohansson’s interpretation of the implication is different from\nhis own (Heyting 1955: 19). But the discussion seems to have had an\neffect on Heyting. The second thoughts that Heyting seems to have\ndeveloped about Kolmogorov’s interpretation as applied to Ex\nFalso are probably related to Johansson’s insistence that\n\\(\\neg a \\rightarrow \\cdot a \\rightarrow b\\) can only be accepted if a\nconstruction can be indicated that, on the assumption that \\(\\neg a\\)\nhas been proved, transforms proofs of \\(a\\) into proofs of \\(b\\). For\nin the justification of Ex Falso that Heyting went on to give\nin his book of 1956, Intuitionism. An introduction, he tried\nto make the case that there indeed is a construction that will do just\nthat; see the discussion in\n section 5.4\n above.  \nFormalized intuitionistic logic with Ex Falso is\ninterpretable in Minimal Logic (Prawitz & Malmnäs 1968: 219,\n221, 224–225). In this translation, \\(\\bot\\) is replaced by an\narbitrary proposition letter that does not occur in the original\nproof. From a contentual point of view, the problem of finding an\nacceptable meaning for the formulas containing that proposition letter\nwould of course remain.  \nHowever, for the specific systems of formalized primitive recursive\narithmetic (PRA) and Heyting Arithmetic (HA) there is a result that is\nmore satisfying from the contentual point of view. Defining \\(\\bot\\)\nas \\(0=1\\) enables one formally to derive \\(\\bot \\rightarrow A\\) for\nany \\(A\\) in the language of the system. The demonstration of this\nfact (Troelstra & van Dalen 1988: 126–127) does not depend\non knowing that there is no proof of \\(0=1\\), and the demonstration\nmakes it easy to see how in these systems from a formal proof of\n\\(0=1\\) one would obtain a formal proof of any given \\(A\\).  \nFor a discussion of other logical aspects of the Heyting-Johansson\ncorrespondence, see van der Molen 2016. On negation in Minimal Logic,\nsee Hazen 1995. Relations between the logic of Kolmogorov 1925 and\nMinimal Logic are discussed in Plisko 1988. Proof-theoretical aspects\nof Minimal Logic are treated in Prawitz 1965 and Prawitz &\nMalmnäs 1968; model-theory in Fitting 1969: 40, Georgacarakos\n1982, and Mendez 1988; an algebraic approach in Rasiowa 1974: chapter\n11. Weakenings of Minimal Logic are the subject of Colacito, de Jongh,\n& Vargas 2017.  \nTo have a genuine implication (and hence also a genuine universal\nquantification) it must be possible to make hypotheses; that this is\npossible in intuitionism was contested by the intuitionists\nFreudenthal and Griss. They did not comment directly on the passage in\nBrouwer’s dissertation discussed above in section\n section 2.2,\n in which Brouwer argues that arguments that seem to involve\nhypothetical constructions in reality do not. Both Freudenthal and\nGriss must have known that argument. Conversely, although Brouwer did\nreact in print to both (see below), this regrettably did not include\nan explicit philosophical engagement with their views. He did express\nhimself at a meeting of the Dutch Mathematical Society at the\nKrasnapolsky Hotel in Amsterdam in 1947, as remembered by Korevaar:\n \nThat day G.F.C. Griss (mathematics teacher in Gouda) spoke about what\nhe called his negationless mathematics. That was even more strict than\nBrouwer’s intuitionism. […] Afterwards there was an extended\ndiscussion at the blackboard. First between Griss and, among others,\nvan Dantzig, who evoked his affirmative mathematics. I think that\nFreudenthal was there, too. Then it was Heyting’s turn; he tried to\nexplain what Brouwer had meant. Finally, and unexpectedly, Brouwer\nhimself appeared, from the back of the room; no one had noticed that\nhe had arrived. Brouwer came forward running, his coat-tails flapping.\nAnd he cried: “You have all misunderstood!” (Korevaar\n2016: 248; translation mine) \nUnfortunately, no report seems to exist on the content of the\ndiscussion.  \nTwo years later the Belgian philosopher S.I. Dockx hoped to organize a\nmeeting on negationless logic with Brouwer, Griss, Freudenthal,\nHeyting, and van Dantzig. Brouwer made it clear, however, that he did\nnot want to participate in an event together with Freudenthal (letter\nof Beth to Dockx of July 8, 1949, in van Dalen 2011: Online\nSupplement, 2446; for Brouwer’s conflict with Freudenthal see van\nDalen 2005: 721–728, 753–757, and 794–799). In the\nend, a colloquium was indeed held in Brussels in 1949, with as\nspeakers Beth, Destouches-Février, Feys, Freudenthal, Griss and\nvan Dantzig (Chronique générale 1949:\n 435).[38]\n As is the case for the meeting in Amsterdam in 1947, there seems to\nexist no report on the content of the discussions; and Heyting’s\nabsence from the list of speakers is as yet unaccounted for.  \nHans Freudenthal (1905–1990) was an intellectually omnivorous\nGerman-Dutch mathematician, who took his PhD in Berlin in 1930 with a\nthesis in topology directed by Brouwer’s friends Hopf and\nBieberbach. He came to know Brouwer when the latter lectured in Berlin\nin 1927, and made a favorable impression on him because of the\ngood questions he asked (van Dalen 2005: 546). In 1930 he moved to\nAmsterdam to become one of Brouwer’s assistants and, from 1931,\nalso lecturer. At the same time he continued his research in\navant-garde topology. After the Second World War, Freudenthal became\nfull professor in Utrecht, and mostly did important work in the\nhistory and didactics of mathematics. (In the preface to\nMathematics as an Educational Task he wrote “My\neducational interpretation of mathematics betrays the influence of\nL.E.J. Brouwer’s view on mathematics (though not on\neducation)”, Freudenthal 1973, ix.) He also edited the second\nvolume of Brouwer’s Collected Works, which contains in\nparticular the papers on topology (Brouwer 1977).  \nIn 1937 Freudenthal formulated two objections to explanations of\nimplication such as Heyting’s and Kolmogorov’s. One is that a\nhypothetical construction of the antecedent provides no actual\nconstruction material at all, so that, if the idea of a construction\nthat proves \\(a \\supset b\\) is to make intuitionistic sense, this\ncould only be done by giving a proof of \\(b\\) via a proof of\n\\(a\\). The second objection is that, moreover, the antecedent \\(a\\)\ncannot even be given a definite meaning without thereby proving it; so\nthat  \nin the Heyting-Kolmogorov explanation the value of implication becomes\nillusory, as the hypothesis, in its quality as hypothesis, immediately\neliminates itself. (Freudenthal 1937b: 115)  \nFreudenthal arrives at this point because of his view that, more\ngenerally, a proof is precisely what gives a statement its definite\nmeaning:  \nIt lies close to hand to explain a statement as the establishing of a\nfact, of the obtaining of which one has convinced oneself by a\nproof, i.e., by bringing about the relation expressed in the\nstatement. But this explanation can only be given cautiously, because\nonce a statement is the establishing of a fact, there is no\njustification anymore of the separation of statement and proof. When I\nsay, for example, that the sequence \\(a_{\\nu}\\) converges positively\nto \\(a\\), this is only an abbreviated way of stating the fact that for\nevery \\(n\\) an \\(N\\) can be determined such that \\(a-a_{\\nu}\\) ≤\n1/\\(n\\) for \\(\\nu\\) ≥ \\(N\\). That for every \\(n\\) an \\(N\\) with\nthis property can be determined, is a statement that has\nintuitionistic sense only if one has a computation method that\ngenerates the \\(N\\) from each \\(n\\), a computation method that can\nroughly be represented by a formula into which \\(a_{\\nu}\\) and \\(a\\)\nenter in some way. This example shows that each statement, once one\nformulates it in an intuitionistically unobjectionable way,\nautomatically contains its full proof. (Freudenthal 1937b: 112;\ntranslation mine) \nBehind the example Freudenthal gives here is the general\nintuitionistic idea that mathematical facts can only consist in the\nexistence of constructions and proofs (which are themselves special\nconstructions), so that spelling out a mathematical fact amounts to\nspecifying the constructions that bring it about; but that is also,\nFreudenthal points out, what a proof is. Absent a proof, a statement\nhas at most a heuristic or provisional meaning.  \nNegative statements are no exception according to Freudenthal, because\ntheir meaning is that all attempts at a construction with certain\nproperties fail to achieve their aim, and a survey of these failings\n(which may depend on complete induction) constitutes the proof of the\nnegative statement. Note that, as a consequence, meaning would not be\ncompositional: The unnegated statement has no non-heuristic meaning of\nits own. This notion of heuristic meaning, which is the only kind of\nmeaning an unnegated statement can have until the survey of attempts\nat constructions for it has been completed, must still be sufficiently\nprecise if it is to serve as the basis of a mathematical proof of a\nnegated statement. This goes in the direction of reading \\(\\beta\\) of\nimplications in\n section 2.2\n above; perhaps the difference with Brouwer is not so great on this\npoint.  \nFreudenthal accepts a special but important case of implication, the\nkind that is implicit in general statements such as “A total\nfunction on [0,1] is uniformly continuous”. In general\nstatements \nthe subject is the function, finitary set, number (as element of a\nset), understood in their wholly free growth. Neither specific nor all\nspecific elements of a whole are meant, but the function,\nthe finitary set, the element of a set, an\nindividual therefore, albeit a peculiar individual, a true Proteus,\nvery peculiar in this respect, that it may arrive that one is\nconsidering two different exemplars of this individual. (Freudenthal\n1937b: 115; translation mine) \nThe assertion then is understood as of a relation between two\npredications of one specific subject, The example is then understood\nas the subject being the function and the predicates\n“being restricted in its free growth to being total on\n[0,1]” and “being restricted in its free growth to being\nuniformly continuous” (Freudenthal 1937b: 115).  \nFreudenthal acknowledges the alternative of reading it as asserting\nthe containment of the species of total functions in the species of\nuniformly continuous ones, but finds a reading in terms of a freely\ngrowing object “intuitionistically more sympathetic”\n(Freudenthal 1937b: 116). He comments without further explanation that\nthis is “so to speak a cataloguing of the species”\n(Freudenthal 1937b: 116). This remark in fact draws on his other\npublication in that issue of Compositio Mathematica, on\nintuitionistic topology. There he gives a definition of which the\nrelevant part is this:\n [39] \nA sequence of things \\(A_n (n=1,2,\\ldots)\\) is called\ncatalogued, if to every \\(A_n\\) is assigned the expression\n\\(\\ne 0\\) and to each \\(A_{\\mu_1}A_{\\mu_2} \\ldots A_{\\mu_k}\\) the\nexpression \\(= 0\\) or \\(\\ne 0\\) (but never both expressions)\n(Freudenthal 1937a: 84; translation mine) \nIn a footnote, it is added that the sequence of things \\(A_n\\) need\nnot be lawlike, but may be growing in more or less freedom. Among the\nconditions on these assignments is specified that of extensibility:\n \nIf \\(A_{\\mu_1}A_{\\mu_2}\\ldots A_{\\mu_{ k} } \\ne 0\\), an \\(m \\ne \\mu_1,\n\\mu_2,\\ldots,\\mu_k\\) can be indicated such that\n\\(A_{\\mu_1}A_{\\mu_2}\\ldots A_{\\mu_{ k} }A_{\\mu_m} \\ne 0\\) (Freudenthal\n1937a: 84; translation mine) \nIn these terms, the content of the example theorem, “A total\nfunction on [0,1] is uniformly continuous”, may be stated as\nfollows. To a species one assigns the expression \\(\\ne 0\\) if a freely\ngrowing object can be restricted so as to have the corresponding\nproperty; and to a sequence of species the expression \\(\\ne 0\\) if a\nfreely growing object can be restricted to have all the corresponding\nproperties, and 0 if it cannot. Then a sequence of species \\(\\ne 0\\)\ncontaining the species of functions that are total on [0,1] may always\nbe extended with the species of functions that are uniformly\ncontinuous.  \nThat Freudenthal finds this reading “intuitionistically more\nsympathetic” is probably because it is more transparently\nrelated to the intuitionistic idea that, on the hand, when we set out\nto construct an object we set out to construct an object of a certain\ntype, and on the other hand that object will acquire properties in\nacts of construction over time. Freudenthal’s Protean\nindividuals are rather suggestive of the later idea, from computer\nscience, of generic prototype objects in certain programming languages\n(on the latter see e.g., Blaschek 1994). These can indeed be treated\nas individuals that have multiple instantiations, and properties can\nbe added to them over time. \n \nFreudenthal acknowledges that it remains to be seen whether his\nproposal can be carried out. De Iongh (1949) comments that Freudenthal\nin effect accepts Russell’s notion of formal implication (Russell\n1903: section 12) as a primitive (Freudenthal does not mention\nRussell). In fact, Russell does not merely find the understanding of\ngeneral implication as a containment relation less sympathetic, but\nmistaken (Russell 1903: section 77). On the other hand,\nRussell’s formal implication is construed as a relation between\ntwo propositional functions, and owes its generality to the fact that\nthese take as arguments any value in the domain, whereas\nFreudenthal’s implication is a relation between two predications\nof an individual, and owes its generality to the fact that the\nindividual in question is not any specific function but “the\nfunction in its free growth”.  \nAs on this construal a proof of a general statement is in fact a proof\nfor one peculiar individual, each instantiation of the general\nstatement for another, normal individual needs its own proof (which\nwill proceed along the exact same lines). Freudenthal accepts this:\n \nThe general proof, given once, serves us no more than a map, which\nindeed facilitates the ascent of a mountain for us, but does not spare\nit. (Freudenthal 1937b: 116; translation mine)  \nThis is also the case when an appeal is made to lemmas that are stated\nschematically, such as \\(m+n = n+m\\). Freudenthal readily acknowledges\nthat in linguistic representations of proof one will not do this, but\nconsiders this a way in which a linguistic representation fails to\ncapture what a proof is.  \nFreudenthal’s paper was followed by comments from\n Heyting.[40]\n Heyting agrees with Freudenthal’s thesis that if a mathematical\nstatement is explained as the linguistic expression of a fact, then\nthe meaning of the statement is given by its\n proof.[41] \nBut at the same time he holds that posing a mathematical problem is\nnot the same as making a mathematical assertion, and that this\ndifference allows for an understanding of implications whose\nantecedent has not been established. An example he gives is that it is\nobviously correct to say that if \\(\\pi\\) contains the sequence\n0123456789, then it contains the sequence 012345678 (Heyting 1937:\n117). (At the time there was no proof of the antecedent. In 1997 a\ncomputer program calculated that at the 17,387,594,880th digit after\nthe decimal point in \\(\\pi\\), a sequence 0123456789 begins (Borwein\n1998). One easily modifies Heyting’s example appropriately.)\nThis is so, because we know how to turn solutions of the problem of\nfinding a sequence 0123456789 into solutions of the problem of finding\na sequence 012345678.  \nFurthermore, Heyting doubts that Freudenthal’s notion of an\nindividual of which there may exist different exemplars clarifies\nmatters. In his view, one would have to represent the collection of\nproper individuals by elements of a spread, so as to be able to\nexplain universal quantification over these individuals in terms of\nthe continuity principle for choice sequences applied to the sequences\nin the representing spread. But he observes that in that case\nBrouwer’s theorem that all total functions on the unit continuum\nare continuous cannot be reconstructed: The continuity of these\nfunctions is in fact a condition of the possibility of their\nrepresentation in a spread. Brouwer published the proof of this\nrepresentation theorem in his 1942B, to which the reader is referred\nfor further details. That publication was clearly occasioned by a\nrenewed interest on Brouwer’s part in the Freudenthal-Heyting\nexchange (see the opening lines of Brouwer 1942A).  \nFreudenthal (1937c) replied to Heyting in turn, but most briefly. He\ndenies that with a reading in terms of problems and solutions the\nproper intuitionistic meaning, that is, one that does not depend on\nlanguage and is not heuristic, has been found; and he considers it\nimprobable that intuitionistic predicate calculus applies only to\nspreads, not to species.  \nThe referee for the journal Compositio Mathematica, in which\nthis exchange between Freudenthal and Heyting appeared, was Brouwer.\nHis report read:  \nInteresting discussion on the sense of one sentence being implied by\nanother, when nothing is known about the correctness of the latter\nsentence. (As quoted and translated in Sundholm & van Atten 2008:\n70) \nOne would have hoped to see Brouwer’s actual thoughts on the\nmatter. On the other hand, as pointed out by van Dalen and Remmert\n(2007: 183), Brouwer was here playing both the role of referee and of\neditor in chief, so the only person meant actually to read this report\nwas he.  \nTo the extent that Freudenthal’s rejection of implication\nimplies a rejection of negation defined as \\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\),\nwhatever momentum Freudenthal’s objection may have had was taken\nover a few years later by the work of Griss; it seems that Griss was\nnot aware of Freudenthal’s paper of 1937. Freudenthal’s\nproposed explanation of universal quantification seems not to have\nbeen developed any further within the tradition.  \nStarting in 1941, Georg François Cornelis Griss argued that\nnegation, and hence a whole class of implications, should be banished\nfrom intuitionism. Griss (1898–1953) had received his PhD in\nAmsterdam in 1925 for a thesis in differential geometry supervised by\nWeitzenböck, but had attended courses by Brouwer and was very\nsympathetic to intuitionism. (Most biographical details in this\nsection come from van Rootselaar 1953–1954 and Pos\n1953–1954.)  \nIn a letter to Brouwer of April 19, 1941, he stated the point of\ndeparture for his negationless mathematics as follows:  \nShowing that something is not true, i.e., showing the incorrectness of\na hypothesis, is not an intuitively clear act. Of a hypothesis, which\nlater turns out to be even wrong, one cannot possibly have an\nintuitively clear representation. One must maintain the demand that\nonly building things up from the foundations makes sense in\nintuitionistic mathematics. (van Dalen 2011: Online Supplement, 2142;\ntranslation mine) \nInsisting on intuitively clear representations throughout, Griss also\nholds that “to define is to construct” (Griss 1947: 69): a\ndefinition is meaningful only if it specifies a construction of the\nobject defined.  \nThus the notion of negation, understood as implication of a falsehood,\nis rejected. In Idealistische Filosofie (1947: 24), Griss\nrepeats the above passage and points out this is in accord with\ncriticism of negation by Bergson in L’Évolution\ncréatrice (Bergson, 298–322); a rare occasion on\nwhich a Brouwerian intuitionist refers to the French philosopher of\nintuition. (Brouwer never discussed Bergson; see van Stigt 1990:\n152–153 and 324 for differences between their conceptions, and\nalso Hesseling 2003: sections 6.3.1–6.3.6.)  \nThe fundamental point of agreement Griss finds with Bergson is that\nthe only meaningful construal of negation consists in the positive\nnotion of distinguishability. For example, the distinguishability of 1\nand 2 is not defined as pure negation of their identity, but is an\nintuitive given based on their generation from the basic intuition of\ntwo-ity. For other objects, such as rational numbers and real numbers,\nthe notion of distinguishability may be defined in terms of that of\nthe natural numbers. With the rejection of negation also came a\nrejection of empty species, so that the intersection of two species\nexists only if they have an element in common. Griss is surprised to\nreport that he has encountered more opposition against the rejection\nof empty species than against the avoidance of negation. (Griss 1951a:\n45)  \nGriss acknowledges a role for problems and solutions in research (in\nterms of which Kolmogorov and Heyting understood logic, including\nnegation); but he does not consider these to belong to mathematics\nproper:  \nTo negationless intuitionistic mathematics belong only constructions\nand properties in relation to those constructions. Posing problems and\nasking for solutions are premathematical activities. It goes without\nsaying that in those premathematical investigations negation may be\nused just as well as all kinds of other means, like the principle of\nthe excluded middle or even a physical experiment. (Griss 1948a: 72;\ntranslation mine) \nPresumably, then, this would have determined his reply if Heyting had\nleveled the same objection to Griss’ position as he had done to\nFreudenthal’s, the objection that it is obviously correct to say\nthat if \\(\\pi\\) contains the sequence 0123456789, then it contains the\nsequence 012345678.  \nIndeed, it is clear that Griss’ conception has much in common\nwith that of Freudenthal. At the same time, Griss’ notion of the\n“premathematical” seems to be much wider than\nFreudenthal’s of the “heuristic”. After all, for\nFreudenthal it was possible mathematically to prove a negative\nstatement by showing that all ways to make the unnegated statement\ntrue by supplying an appropriate construction must fail. For Griss\nthis is clearly excluded. (It seems Freudenthal and Griss never\ncommented in print on each other’s positions. Note also that\nGriss, in his long letter to Brouwer of 1941 mentioned above that\nlaunched his program, does not refer to Freudenthal.)  \nSince negationless mathematics accepts only true propositions, its\npropositional logic contains only conjunction &, with implication\nas a special case: “The implication \\(p \\rightarrow q\\) will\nhave its natural meaning: \\(q\\) follows from \\(p\\), \\(p\\) is true, so\n\\(q\\) is also true” (Griss 1951a: 41). However, an\ninterpretation of Heyting’s propositional logic in this logic of\n& and \\(\\rightarrow\\) becomes possible by construing it as a logic\nof classes or species (Griss 1948b, 1951a). A basic species, for\nexample that of the natural numbers, is taken as given, and all others\nwill be constructed as subspecies of it. Then \\(\\neg a\\) can be\ndefined as the complement of a relative to the basic species and \\(a\n\\vee b\\) is the union of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Thus, Griss (1951a) applied\nthe strategy Heyting had used in 1928 to Heyting’s own\nformalization and deleted the parts that are not acceptable in\nnegationless mathematics (while adding axioms and conditions to ensure\nthat species be inhabited).  \nAxioms for an interpretation of predicate logic are obtained from\nthose for propositional logic (Griss 1951a: 48). One substitutes\n\\(a(x)\\) for \\(p\\) everywhere, and prefixes all axioms in which \\(x\\)\noccurs with \\(\\forall x\\). The meaning of \\(a(x)\\) is that \\(x\\) is an\nelement of the species \\(a\\), and \\(\\forall x(a(x) \\rightarrow\nb(x))\\), is defined as \\(a \\subset b\\). (See below for a further\nremark on this in relation to a criticism voiced by Heyting in 1955.)\n \nTreating intuitionistic mathematics according to Griss’\nprinciples requires a substantial reconstruction. After a first\nmathematical sketch of his project in Dutch (Griss 1944), Griss made\nan informal start with parts of intuitionistic arithmetic, the theory\nof real numbers, and projective geometry in a series of papers\npublished between 1946 and 1951 (Griss 1946, 1950, 1951b,c,d).  \nGriss was not able to continue that series, as in 1951 an illness\nbegan that would lead to his early death in 1953. However, he was able\nto act as the unofficial adviser of Nicolle Dequoy, who defended a\ndoctoral thesis on negationless projective geometry at the\nUniversité de Paris in 1952 (published as Dequoy 1955). Formal\nwork on negationless logic in Griss’ sense was done by\nDestouches-Février\n (1948),[42]\n Gilmore 1953a, 1953b, and 1953c, Vredenduin 1953, Valpola 1955,\nNelson 1966. This line of work culminated in Krivtsov 2000a, 2000b,\n2000c, which give a comprehensive modern treatment of negationless\npredicate logic, arithmetic, analysis, and higher-order arithmetic.\n \nWhen Griss began to elaborate the negationless intuitionistic\nmathematics that he proposed, Brouwer and Heyting supported his career\nin two ways. From 1944 to 1951, they communicated Griss’ papers\nto the Royal Dutch Academy of\n Sciences;[43]\n and in 1949 they used their influence to reduce Griss’ teaching\nload at the high school in Gouda where he worked (van Rootselaar\n1953–1954: 43).  \nBut while supporting the publication of Griss’ papers, Brouwer\nat the same time presented a counterargument to one of Griss’\nexamples that implied that he did not support Griss’\nphilosophical\n claim.[44]\n In his letter to Brouwer of 1941, Griss had remarked that  \nNo real number is known about which it has been proved that it cannot\npossibly be equal to 0 \\((a \\ne 0)\\) while at the same time it has not\nbeen proven that the number differs positively from 0 (\\(a\n\\mathbin{\\#} 0\\)). (van Dalen 2011: 405)  \n(\\(a \\mathbin{\\#} b\\), the apartness relation, is defined as \\(\\exists\nn(|a-b| \\gt (1/2)^n)\\).) Brouwer went on to publish a construction of a\nreal number with just that property in “Essentially negative\nproperties” (1948A). Brouwer’s argument, while suggestive, is\nperhaps not wholly conclusive: although it does show that the most\nobvious candidate for a positive equivalent fails, it does not show\nthat there can be no such equivalent (Krivtsov 2000a: 167). Moreover,\nBrouwer did not make explicit how his own philosophical understanding\nof negation differed from that of Griss.  \nIn 1949, David van Dantzig argued that the method that Brouwer had\nused in devising his example of an essentially negative property,\nwhich has become known as the method of the creating subject\n (section 3.3),\n depended on the untenable thesis “that there will\n‘always’ be a human being willing and capable” of\nworking on open problems (van Dantzig 1949: 951). Brouwer replied, in\npersonal correspondence, that any psychological interpretation of\nintuitionism is incorrect (van Dalen 2011: 439; van Atten 2004b:\nchapter 6 for discussion). Note that, whether correct or not, this\nobjection does not hinge on the possibility of negation as such.\n\n \nVan Dantzig also pointed out that Brouwer’s construction cannot\nbe used as an argument against Griss’ position, on pain of\ncircularity:  \nIn any case it seems impossible to define Brouwer’s use of the\nterm “absurd” without using another negative term (like\n“contradiction”), in other words it seems to be\nunavoidable to consider Brouwer’s general form of the negation\nas an “entité primitive”, irreducible to\naffirmative concepts. Therefore Brouwer’s theorem can not\ninvalidate the attempts of other mathematicians (in particular G.F.C.\nGriss, Mrs. P. Destouches-Février and the present author) to do\nwithout the concept of negation. On the contrary, it shows again, how\nunclear the concept of “absurdity” is, and makes its\navoidance appear more desirable. (van Dantzig 1949: 952) \nOn the other hand, while it is clear that Brouwer himself did not\nshare these objections to absurdity, he had opened his article not by\nsaying that he wrote it to refute but “to estimate the\nsignificance of affirmative or negationless mathematics, the\ndevelopment of which is sometimes advocated” (Brouwer 1948A:\n963).  \nThe “affirmative mathematics” mentioned in these\nquotations from van Dantzig and Brouwer was proposed by van Dantzig as\na formal system for classical mathematicians to reason about numerical\ncalculations and empirical problems (van Dantzig 1947b, 1951). It\ncontains neither negation nor disjunction, although in certain\ncontexts weak versions of these can be defined, and existential\nquantifiers must be\n bounded.[45]\n Presented as “intuitionistic mathematics from a formal\nstandpoint”, it does not aim to be a philosophical foundation of\na logic for intuitionistic\n mathematics.[46] \nIn 1955, Heyting objected to Griss’ position that it made it\nimpossible to express generality:  \nIf we say, “For all real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), \\(a+b =\nb+a\\)”, this means the same as “If we construct two real\nnumbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(a+b = b+a\\)”, but we have not\nactually constructed them. (Heyting 1953–1955: 95) \nTaking this line further, a proof of the general statement would\nrequire the actual construction of all pairs of real numbers (and then\nshowing that for each pair the equality holds), which is impossible.\nBut in a review of Heyting’s paper, Vredenduin replied that the\nGrissian meaning is this:  \nAs soon as you have realized two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), you can\nbe certain that \\(a + b = b + a\\). This would be meaningless only if\nreal numbers were unrealizable. (Vredenduin 1956: 91) \nAccordingly, what a general statement expresses directly is not a\nproperty of actual constructions, nor of unactual ones, but the\ncorrectness of a rule that applies to actual constructions. The\npremisse of the rule then means no more than “Let \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\) be any two real numbers that we have constructed”. Griss\nwould accept that as meaningful because he supplied a notion of real\nnumber and a construction method that shows that the species of real\nnumbers thus construed is inhabited. Compare:  \nThe well-known turn in mathematics: “Suppose ABC to be\nrectangular” seems to be a supposition, but mostly means:\n“Consider a rectangular triangle ABC”. (Griss 1950:\n456) \nFor further philosophical discussion of affirmative and negationless\nmathematics, see Apostel 1972; Beth 1966: 436–439; Fraenkel et\nal. 1973: 249–251; Franchella 1994b; Franchella 2008:\n57–68; Heyting 1953–55; Heyting 1956: section 8.2. For an\nalgebraic study of negationless logic see Imai & Iseki 1966 and\nArruda1978; the latter also compares Griss’ and\nVredenduin’s systems with one another. Modern formalizations of\nnegationless systems are given in Krivtsov 2000a,b,c.  \nGriss’ negationless logic has been connected to the Curry-Howard\nisomorphism (e.g., Colson & Michel 2007, 2008, 2009; Michel 2008) and\nto the Calculus of Constructions (Demange 2012). These authors speak\nof “pedagogical logic”, as it reflects the pedagogical\nideal that newly introduced hypotheses and definitions be motivated by\nexamples.  \nAn example of recent mathematical work that finds inspiration in the\nnegationless approach is Veldman 2008.  \nFinally, this entry has not, as yet, discussed precursors to Brouwer,\nmore intricate aspects of Brouwer’s “strong\ncounterexamples”, \nthe\nobjections to the Proof Interpretation of circularity and impredicativity, \nor the later developments\naround the Proof Interpretation. These will be subject of future\nupdates.","contact.mail":"vanattenmark@gmail.com","contact.domain":"gmail.com"}]
