This\nconcerns especially his notorious critique of religion, and his\nteaching that the cosmos is produced through the interaction of five\n“eternal principles”, namely God, Soul, matter, time, and\nplace. We do however have direct access to one branch of his\nphilosophy, namely ethics, represented by a work of advice called\nThe Spiritual Medicine and a briefer rejoinder to his\ncritics, The Philosophical Way of Life. (Note that Abū\nBakr is not to be confused with other philosophers from the same city\nof Rayy, who are also called al-Rāzī: the most famous of\nthese is Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, who wrote several\ncenturies later.)\n\n\nAbū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyāʾ\nal-Rāzī made his fame mostly as a doctor. As his name\n“al-Rāzī” indicates, he hailed from the Persian\ncity of Rayy, near modern-day Tehran. His biographers report that he\nran a hospital there, and another in Baghdad. He received patronage\nfrom Abū Ṣāliḥ al-Manṣūr (d. 914),\nthe governor of Rayy, to whom al-Rāzī dedicated a\nsubstantial medical treatise, The Book for\nal-Manṣūr. We have a variety of anecdotes about\nal-Rāzī’s medical practice, some found in his own\nworks and some in his medieval biographers, for instance that\nal-Rāzī would deal only with patients whose condition\nstumped his students. We also know, because he tells us himself, that\nhe suffered from eye problems and a hand injury from copious reading,\ncopying, and writing. \nThis latter piece of information is found in The Philosophical Way\nof Life, which is a good first text to read by al-Rāzī\n(Arabic edition in al-Rāzī\n RF;\n English translation in al-Rāzī\n PWL).\n In it he rebuts accusations that he is a hypocrite for claiming to\nmodel his lifestyle on that of Socrates, when in fact Socrates was\nrigorously ascetic and al-Rāzī is not (see Strohmaier 1974).\nAl-Rāzī responds by saying that reports of Socrates’\nasceticism, which unbeknownst to him go back to a confusion in the\nsources between Socrates and Diogenes the Cynic, do not tell the whole\nstory. In fact Socrates adopted a lifestyle of moderation as he\nmatured, and it is this model that al-Rāzī imitates. \nThis is one of only two complete surviving works by al-Rāzī\ndevoted solely to a philosophical topic; the other one also deals with\nethics. This is The Spiritual Medicine (Arabic edition in\nal-Rāzī RF; English translation in al-Rāzī\n SPR\n and for discussion Adamson 2016), a longer book of ethical advice\npresented to his patron al-Manṣūr as a complement to the\naforementioned medical treatise. Here al-Rāzī offers\ntreatment for the soul, following on his overview of treatments for\nthe body (Adamson 2019). Apart from this, the most significant\nsurviving work for his philosophy is his Doubts about Galen\n(Arabic critical edition and translation by Koetschet in\nal-Rāzī\n DG).\n Al-Rāzī considered Galen the greatest of medical\nauthorities, but on the basis of Galen’s own critical attitude\ntowards esteemed predecessors, felt free to critique weak points in\nthe extensive corpus of Galenic works that had been translated into\nArabic. While a number of these points naturally concern medicine, the\nDoubts also touches on a wide range of philosophical issues,\nas discussed below. \nBeyond this, the extant writings have to do mostly with medicine,\nincluding a number of smaller treatises, like a celebrated text on the\ndifference between smallpox and measles (English translation in\nal-Rāzī\n SM), and the by no means small Comprehensive Book, a\nstaggeringly huge collection of notes on medicine that was compiled by\nal-Rāzī’s students after his death. The\nComprehensive Book is sometimes said to present\nal-Rāzī’s “case notes”. But, while it is\ntrue that he reports on his own medical experiences, the work is more\naccurately described as a collection of excerpts from Greek and Arabic\nmedical sources. When he does introduce “case notes” this\nis to provide counterexamples and amplifications for the textual\nevidence (Savage-Smith 2012). Broadly speaking, despite his often\nharsh diatribe against Galen’s failures in the Doubts,\nal-Rāzī’s own medical theories fall broadly within the\nGalenic framework, and thus deploy such standard concepts as the four\nhumors, the natural powers of the body, and the role of\npneuma in explaining animal sensation and motion. \nA final group of works that come down to us from al-Rāzī\ndiscuss alchemy (Ruska 1935). He was evidently a practicing alchemist\nand describes in detail a wide variety of chemical procedures, all\naimed towards the goal of manufacturing valuable minerals and stones,\nor likenesses thereof. It may be that al-Rāzī’s\natomist theory of matter provided him with a basis for understanding\nthese processes. Chemical transformation would involve breaking down\ncomplex substances to more primitive particles and then recombining\nthem in other proportions to produce the desired result (Kraus\n1942–3: vol. 2, 10–11; Adamson 2021: 96–98). \nBeyond these extant works we have reports on the full range of\nal-Rāzī’s writings by later authors who recorded lists\nof their titles. These confirm that he wrote much on medicine,\nphilosophy, and alchemy, as well as mathematics, logic, and poetry.\nMost eye-catching here, though, are works in which he discussed\nreligion and, especially, prophecy. The latter bear titles like On\nthe Tricks of Supposed Prophets and On the Necessity of the\nProphetic Mission. That could just show that he was concerned to\nrefute the claims of spurious prophets, while accepting the legitimacy\nof true prophets. But in reports by still other authors, we are given\na picture of al-Rāzī as a fundamentally anti-religious\nauthor who rejected all revelation and prophecy. This is especially\nthe case with al-Rāzī’s contemporary, also from Rayy,\nAbū Ḥātim al-Rāzī (d. 934). In a treatise\ncalled The Proofs of Prophecy, Abū Ḥātim\nrecounts face-to-face debates he had with al-Rāzī and then\nsummarizes, and elaborately refutes, a treatise by al-Rāzī\nthat supposedly sought to unmask the falsehoods of all revelatory\nreligious traditions (see\n AHR\n in the bibliography). \nAlong with Abū Ḥātim, two other sources are crucial\nfor reconstructing al-Rāzī’s cosmology. These are\nNaṣīr-e Khosraw (d. 1088), who explained this cosmology in\norder to refute it in his Persian work Provision for the\nTraveler (hereafter\n NK,\n selective trans. into Arabic in al-Rāzī RF), and yet\nanother al-Rāzī, this time the famous theologian-philosopher\nFakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 1210), in his Exalted\nTopics (hereafter\n FDR).\n From these and a few other sources, we can piece together the details\nof a remarkable account of the creation of the world, which invokes\nfive factors that have always existed and come together to produce the\ncosmos: God, Soul, matter, time, and place. Abū Ḥātim\nand Naṣīr-e Khosraw both present this as an appalling\ndeparture from Islam, since it involves postulating four eternal\nprinciples alongside God. \nSome reports suggest that al-Rāzī saw his five principles as\nhaving a systematic structure: God and Soul are active and alive,\nmatter passive and non-living, and time and place neither active, nor\npassive, nor alive. But the scheme does not seem to be motivated by\nits ability to satisfy all logical possibilities. Rather,\nal-Rāzī argues specifically for each of the five principles.\nGod’s existence is demonstrated on the basis of the good design\nof the universe; more contentious are the other four. \nWhile the Soul is invoked as the source of life in bodies, its primary\nfunction in al-Rāzī’s philosophy is to facilitate a\ndistinctive theodicy. The presence of great suffering in the world,\nalongside the aforementioned good design of that world, shows that it\ncannot have been created directly by God. Furthermore,\nal-Rāzī is concerned with a traditional argument against the\neternity of the universe, namely that a perfectly wise and rational\nGod could not arbitrarily choose a moment for the universe to begin\nexisting. Both problems are solved by postulating a Soul which is\n“foolish” where God is wise. The Soul conceives of a\ndesire or even passion (ʿishq) to be “mixed”\nwith matter, which initiates the process of the world’s\ncreation. God intervenes to make the world as good as it can be, but\nour bodily life is still inevitably full of pain. \nOne question that arises here is why God would not prevent the Soul\nfrom mixing with matter, if this is such a bad idea.\nAl-Rāzī’s explanation is that God allows it to happen\nas a learning experience for the Soul (Goodman 1975). God bestows upon\nthe Soul the gift of reason or intellect (ʿaql), and\nSoul can use this to realize that it should be working to free itself\nfrom its unwise bond with matter (Druart 1996). We have reports of\nparables used by al-Rāzī to explain this. A wise father\nmight allow his inexperienced child to venture to a dangerous country,\nbut send with him a good advisor (namely the intellect; Fakhr\nal-Dīn al-Rāzī, FDR: vol. 4, 416). Similarly, a wise\nfather might allow his foolish child to go into an alluring garden\nfull of thorns and stinging insects, so as to teach the child a lesson\n(Abū Ḥātim al-Rāzī, AHR: 18–19). This\ntheodicy points the way towards a conception of our ultimate end,\nnamely to escape from the material world, achieving\n“liberation” through moderate lifestyle and the practice\nof philosophy. \nAs for matter, time, and place, these principles are required in order\nthat the universe may be created at all (for an overview see Fakhry\n1968). First, al-Rāzī thinks that there must already be some\nmaterial before the cosmos exists, out of which it is constructed. As\nNāṣir-e Khosraw (NK: 75) complains, al-Rāzī\nbelieved that creation ex nihilo was impossible. He argued\nfor this on the grounds that we constantly see things being produced\nthrough lengthy processes of development, even though instantaneous\nmanifestation would be far easier and involve less suffering: he gives\nthe example of the need for childbirth and growth to maturity. His\npoint is that God would not cause this to happen, if He could just\nmake humans exist from nothing. Time and place are needed for an\nanalogous reason. Time cannot be created, since creation must occur\nat a time, and place cannot be created, because there would\nalready need to be somewhere to put it. \nAl-Rāzī’s conception of matter is unusual among\nfalāsifa, that is, thinkers of the Islamic world who\nrespond primarily to the Greek philosophical tradition. More or less\nall of them, from al-Kindī (d. after 870) to\nal-Fārābī (d. 950), Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna, d.\n1037), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes, d. 1198), endorse a broadly\nAristotelian understanding of bodies as potentially subject to\nindefinite division. By contrast, al-Rāzī is an atomist\n(Pines 1936 [1997], Baffioni 1982, Langermann 2009). He believes that\nthe four elements (or possibly five: our sources are not clear as to\nwhether he thinks the heavens are constituted from a distinct fifth\nelement) differ in their properties because of variations in the ratio\nof atoms to void. Thus earth, which has little or no void in it, is\ndark, cold, dense, and moves downward; fire is luminous, hot, subtle,\nand moves upward. Actually these are not strictly\n“elements” but only the most basic compounds of atoms,\nwhich are truly fundamental. Though contemporary Islamic theologians\nwere also atomists (Dhanani 1994), al-Rāzī’s theory\ndiffers from theirs in some respects, and we know that he debated the\ntopic of matter with a theologian named\nal-Miṣmaʿī. \nAl-Rāzī referred to atoms as “absolute\n(muṭlaq) matter”, a locution echoed in his\ncharacterizations of the last two principles, namely “absolute\ntime” and “absolute place”. These are also known,\nrespectively, as “eternity (dahr)” or\n“duration (mudda)” and “void\n(khalāʾ)”. As we learn from the report of the\ndebate with Abū Ḥātim, al-Rāzī was concerned\nto stress the independence of time and place from bodies, that is,\nfrom composites of atoms (Abū Ḥātim al-Rāzī,\nAHR: 12). Time in itself is simply eternal duration, with events\n(including the creation of the world) and motions happening within\nthat duration. Similarly, place in itself is an infinite void, into\nwhich the bounded physical cosmos is placed. As already explained,\nvoid also exists (at least at the microscopic level) within the\ncosmos, since its admixture into bodies explains the variation between\nthe elements. \nAl-Rāzī’s theories may be usefully contrasted to those\nof Aristotle; we know he was familiar with Aristotle’s\nPhysics because he tells us as much in his Philosophical\nWay of Life. For Aristotle, time and place are dependent or\nsupervenient phenomena: place is the inner boundary of the body that\ncontains the body that is in place, while time is the number of\nmotion. Al-Rāzī by contrast makes space-time independent.\nFor instance he proposed a thought experiment that, if the universe\nwere taken away, its place would remain (a similar idea is proposed by\nPhiloponus in Phys. 574, translated in Philoponus\n CPV:\n 36). However his attitude towards Aristotelian physics is more\nnuanced than straightforward rejection (Adamson 2021: ch.5). For he\naccepts that one may speak of “relative” time and place,\nwhich would be the time and place of a particular motion and\nparticular body, respectively. For example a year would be a\ndemarcated segment of eternal duration that measures the sun’s\nmotion along the ecliptic, while the place of a ball would be the\nlimit of the region of void occupied by the ball. Likewise,\nal-Rāzī includes the Aristotelian elements, earth, water,\nair, fire, and perhaps ether, in his cosmology but does not accept\nthat these are fundamental. As just seen, the real\n“element” that underlies them is atomic. \nThus Aristotle managed to articulate genuine principles of physics,\nbut only “relative” ones that need to be understood within\na more basic framework. It was Plato who, in al-Rāzī’s\nopinion, had gotten closest to putting forward that framework.\nAbū Ḥātim says that al-Rāzī told him as\nmuch: “what Plato says is hardly different from what I believe\nconcerning time, and this, according to me, is the best thing that has\nbeen said about it” (Abū Ḥātim\nal-Rāzī, AHR: 13). The text he must have in mind is\nPlato’s Timaeus, which he would have known through the\nintermediary of Galen (see Galen,\n CTP\n for the Arabic translation of his paraphrase of the dialogue). The\nTimaeus likewise postulates a pre-existing matter that is\nformed into the cosmos; it can also be read as suggesting that time\nand place in some sense pre-exist the cosmos. Furthermore, Plato puts\nforward an atomic theory in the Timaeus. In fact,\nal-Rāzī rises to the defense of that theory in Doubts\nabout Galen (al-Rāzī, DG: §15.1-6). So there is\ngood reason to believe that al-Rāzī was modeling his\ncosmology primarily on Plato’s, as he understood it, albeit with\nadjustments. \nOn the other hand, Naṣīr-e Khosraw tells us that\nal-Rāzī plagiarized this whole theory from his teacher,\nĪrānshahrī. He is an obscure figure whose works are\nlost, though al-Bīrūnī (d. ca. 1050) does speak of him\nas an expert in astronomy and the diversity of religions. Another\nwitness, Abū l-Maʿālī (fl. 1092), has\nĪrānshahrī claiming to have been a prophet who had\nreceived revelation from an angel, like the Prophet Muhammad did. He\nreports that for Īrānshahrī, all religions put forth a\nsingle teaching, an idea which might be thought to resonate with\nal-Rāzī’s own irenic, rationalist approach to\nrevelation. If Naṣīr-e Khosraw is right to trace the Razian\ncosmology to this shadowy teacher, then perhaps we should think of\nal-Rāzī’s project as a creative fusion of\nĪrānshahri’s ideas and Plato’s. \nFrom the foregoing discussion of al-Rāzī’s theodicy it\nmay seem obvious that his ethical teaching would focus on the goal of\nliberation from the body and its concerns. But as mentioned already,\nhis Philosophical Way of Life defends a lifestyle of\nmoderation, and distances itself from outright asceticism.\nFurthermore, in this text he says that bodily pleasure may licitly be\nsought so long as one does not transgress what he calls a “limit\npast which one may not go”. This limit dictates that we should\npartake of no pleasures \nthat can be attained only by engaging in evildoing, murder, and in\ngeneral anything that displeases God, when the judgment of intellect\nand justice is that it is unnecessary. All else is permitted.\n(al-Rāzī, RF: 106–7) \nOn the other hand, in the Spiritual Medicine he seems to take\na dim view of pleasures, and offers advice for resisting the allure of\nfood, drink, sex, and luxury. One point made in both works is that it\nis a violation of reason to enjoy things that entail more pain than\npleasure in the long run, like overeating. In the Spiritual\nMedicine al-Rāzī tells the story of how he chastized a\nman who gobbled down a plate of dates, warning him that it would lead\nto illnesses, and thus “many times more pain than the pleasure\nyou have had” (al-Rāzī, RF: 71). \nTwo interpretations have been offered to explain\nal-Rāzī’s position on pleasure. According to Lenn E.\nGoodman (1971, 1999, followed by Groff 2014), al-Rāzī was\ndefending an Epicurean ethic in which pleasure should be maximized. On\nthis account, his rationale for moderation is that it is the way to\nhave the most pleasure: going too far with pleasures turns out to be\nmore painful in the long run. This interpretation has been criticized\nby Adamson (2008a, 2021), on the grounds that it ignores\nal-Rāzī’s own theory of pleasure. According to this\ntheory, which is clearly based on the Timaeus, pleasure can\nbe had only as the result of a process of removing a harmful state.\nFor example, drinking is pleasant because it eliminates thirst. On\nthis account of pleasure, as Plato himself pointed out, hedonism is an\nattempt to win at a zero-sum game: you can only have pleasure to the\nextent that you have suffered pain, or at least harm. (Not all harm is\nfelt as pain, just as not all restoration is felt as pleasure, because\nonly fast changes are noticeable.) Furthermore, al-Rāzī says\nhimself in the Doubts about Galen (DG: §7.7) that\npleasure is not the good to be sought in itself, which is a\ndirect rejection of the sort of hedonism adopted in Epicureanism. \nOn this latter reading, much of al-Rāzī’s advice for\nreaders focuses on helping non-philosophers work towards a moderate\nlifestyle, which will prepare them for the more serious and important\nundertaking of adopting a “philosophical way of life” that\nwill ultimately lead to liberation from the body. Al-Rāzī\nhimself seems to accept this distinction between\n“pre-philosophical” and “philosophical” ethics\n(Druart 1997, Adamson 2016), for example in the aforementioned passage\nabout the glutton who loves dates. Al-Rāzī says he\nthreatened the man with stomach aches and illness because \nthis and other such remarks are of more benefit to someone who has not\nengaged in philosophical training than proofs built on philosophical\nprinciples. \nAs for the truly philosophical life, it resides in the Platonic ideal\nof imitating God (Theaetetus 176b), realized through the\npursuit of wisdom and justice towards all living things. In a\nremarkable passage of the Philosophical Way of Life,\nal-Rāzī stresses the importance of not mistreating beasts of\nburden and other non-rational animals (Adamson 2012). This would\nexplain the “upper limit” placed on the pursuit of\njustice: that limit does not derive from the need to maximize pleasure\nand minimize pain, but from the injunction to avoid “displeasing\nGod” by engaging in injustice. \nIn more recent publications this interpretive dispute seems to be\nmoving towards agreement. Goodman (2015) now concedes that\nal-Rāzī, unlike Epicurus, does not make pleasure the highest\ngood and sole criterion in ethics. He does however adopt a therapeutic\napproach to ethics, which is characteristic of Epicureanism, as of\ncourse is the advice to avoid things that bring pain than pleasure all\nthings considered. Adamson accepts this (2021: 6), but suggests that\nthe resonances with Epicureanism may rather reflect a more general\nreception of Hellenistic ethics by al-Rāzī, again through\nthe intermediary of Galen (see also Bar-Asher 1989). \nAs yet, al-Rāzī’s extensive medical corpus has barely\nbeen explored with a view to its philosophical significance. An\naccount of the human body and its primary organs in the Spiritual\nLife—here ascribed to Plato—echoes what he says on\nthis topic in medical works (Adamson 2021: 57–58). His view,\nfollowing both Galen and the Timaeus, is that humans have\nthree general powers or faculties (quwan), the rational,\nanimal or irascible, and vegetative or desiderative, associated\nrespectively with the brain, heart, and liver. The rational soul is\nnot really seated in the brain, as the other two faculties are seated\nin their organs; it uses the brain only as an instrument. In medical\ncontexts al-Rāzī makes the same three organs to be the seats\nof these powers, albeit that the power in the brain is instead called\n“psychic (nafsānī)”, perhaps to\nacknowledge the fact that its powers of voluntary self-motion and\nsensation also belong to irrational animals. \nAl-Rāzī’s views on medical epistemology are also\nGalenic, and presuppose that the best doctor should understand the\nhuman body at a theoretical level while also drawing on a wealth of\nexperience (Pormann 2008). This provides a methodological context for\nunderstanding the aforementioned Comprehensive Book, which as\nmentioned collects book-learning on medical theory, but uses\nal-Rāzī’s own empirical observations to confirm or\ndisconfirm those theories. \nBut the most rewarding medical text for philosophical readers is\nDoubts about Galen. Or rather, it should be said that this\nwork deals with a range of philosophical, as well as medical, issues,\nincluding the relation between soul and body, vision, atomism, and\npleasure (see the ample introduction by Koetschet in\nal-Rāzī, DG). Regarding the first of these issues,\nal-Rāzī criticizes Galen for suggesting that the soul is\nentirely dependent on bodily states or “temperament”, that\nis, the mixture of the body’s constituents. As in the\nSpiritual Medicine, he defends Plato’s idea that the\nrational part of the soul only uses the brain as an “instrument\n(āla)”, and that injury to the brain impedes\nrational function only in the way that damage to a flute would make it\nharder for the flute player to perform (al-Rāzī, DG:\n§21.4). When it comes to vision, al-Rāzī strikes a less\nPlatonist note, since he rejects Galen’s\n“extramissionist” theory, which is in part inspired by\nPlato’s Timaeus. According to Galen, spirit\n(pneuma) is sent forth from the eyes and transforms air,\nmaking it into an instrument for contacting the visual object\n(Ierodiakonou 2014). Instead, al-Rāzī defends the view that\nincorporeal images are sent from the seen object and arrive at the eye\n(Koetschet 2017a). \nOne of the more elaborate philosophical discussions in the Doubts\nabout Galen comes early in the work, and is devoted to the\neternity of the world (this section is translated in PWL).\nAl-Rāzī here takes issue with Galen’s suggestion that\nempirical observation shows that the world was not created after not\nexisting. Galen’s idea, based on a passage in Aristotle (On\nthe Heavens 1.3, 270b11–16), is that the universe seems to\nbe unchanging in its general features. If it is unchanging then it is\nnot liable to corruption, and what is incorruptible is also\nungenerable. Thus the universe has always existed, and always will.\nAl-Rāzī has little difficulty poking holes in this argument:\nhe points out that the universe could be unchanging for a long time,\nand then be destroyed all at once, like a glass being smashed or a\nbuilding collapsing when previously solid ground under it gives way\n(al-Rāzī, DG: §2.3). Furthermore, the incorruptibility\nof the universe would not be guaranteed by its lacking a natural\ntendency to decay. One also needs to rule out that there is some\nexternal cause that could destroy it (al-Rāzī, DG:\n§2.5). As often in the Doubts, al-Rāzī is here\nnot trying to show that Galen’s conclusion is wrong—though\nin this case, we know that he thinks it is wrong—but that the\nargument offered for the conclusion is not sufficient. Ironically,\nthis seems to be in accord with Galen’s own original intention.\nGalen’s argument is taken from his On Demonstration and\nwas actually offered as an example of a proof that is not\ndemonstrative (Koetschet 2015). Al-Rāzī is either being\nremarkably contentious, or has lost sight of the context of the\nargument: he even accuses Galen of being inconsistent, as he elsewhere\nstates that it cannot be proven whether or not the universe is\neternal. \nIf the five eternal theory was considered problematic by\ncontemporaries and later authors, al-Rāzī’s views on\nreligion were considered utterly outrageous and heretical. In his\nProofs of Prophecy, Abū Ḥātim selectively\nquotes and paraphrases from a work by al-Rāzī on this topic,\nand presents him as having flatly denied the validity of prophetic\nrevelation. Accepting this evidence as more or less reliable, some\nmodern-day scholars have celebrated al-Rāzī as a\n“freethinker” comparable with such daringly unorthodox\nthinkers as Ibn al-Rāwandī (Urvoy 1996, Stroumsa 1999), or\neven as having had pagan sympathies (Vallat 2015a, 2015b, 2016).\nAgainst this, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī quotes our\nal-Rāzī as having offered interpretations of the\nQurʾān, which were designed to show that this revelatory\ntext and indeed the whole history of prophecy was in agreement with\nhis own philosophy (this evidence is presented and discussed in Rashed\n2000, 2008). The bio-bibliographical tradition is also ambiguous in\nits evidence. For instance al-Bīrūnī, who clearly\nadmired al-Rāzī, admits that he made foolish and obstinate\nremarks about religion and prophecy. But another broadly favorable\nwitness, Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa, says that a supposed work\nattacking religion was perhaps written by “malicious enemies of\nal-Rāzī and ascribed to him” (for references, see\nAdamson 2021: 11). \nThe most ample, if not necessarily trustworthy, evidence is found in\nAbū Ḥātim. He says that in face-to-face debate,\nal-Rāzī argued against prophecy on the grounds that it would\nbe unjust to single out only some people for knowledge that is useful\nby everyone. Furthermore, appointing only a certain few as religious\nleaders (imāms) would lead to dissension between their\nfollowers (Abū Ḥātim, AHR: 1). Followers of religious\nlaw are guilty of the cardinal intellectual sin of the Islamic world,\ntaqlīd, which means uncritically adopting beliefs on the\nbasis of authority (AHR: 24). Instead, al-Rāzī argues, God\ngives reason (ʿaql) to everyone, and in this respect\neveryone is created equal, able to determine for themselves what goals\nthey should be pursuing. Furthermore, Abū Ḥātim tells\nus about a range of more specific religious teachings rejected by\nal-Rāzī in his book against prophecy, such as\nanthropomorphic descriptions of God and the possibility of miracles,\nincluding the inimitability of the Qurʾān\n(iʿjāz). \nIn several respects this teaching on prophecy fits well with what we\nknow of al-Rāzī’s philosophy more generally. It\ninvokes the idea that reason is given to the soul as a gift from God,\nsomething confirmed in other sources and suggested at the beginning of\nal-Rāzī’s Spiritual Medicine. Furthermore,\nAbū Ḥātim has al-Rāzī arguing that God would\nnot send prophets because this is an unreasonable and overly difficult\nway to achieve His goals (Abū Ḥātim, AHR: 1;\n131–2). Why not just give everyone the ability to figure things\nout for themselves? This same premise that God only proceeds in the\nmost rational way is also important in his theodicy as we know it from\nother sources, as seen above. Furthermore the critique of\ntaqlīd, while admittedly commonplace, does sound like it\ncould come from al-Rāzī: his irreverent approach to Galen\nbears witness to a similar independence of mind, albeit in a very\ndifferent context. \nOn the other hand, the evidence presented by Fakhr al-Dīn casts\nserious doubt on the notion that al-Rāzī was openly hostile\nto the Islamic revelation. And this is backed up by evidence internal\nto al-Rāzī’s own surviving works, for instance\nacknowledgment of the preeminent value of “books sent by\nGod” in Doubts about Galen (al-Rāzī, DG:\n§2.1). At a minimum it seems clear that al-Rāzī was a\nforthright rationalist, who believed that the truth of a revelatory\ntext would necessarily accord with the truth discoverable by human\nreason. But that position would not be so remarkable: it is shared\nfrom other philosophers of the Islamic world, from al-Kindī to\nal-Fārābī to Ibn Rushd. The question is whether\nal-Rāzī went further and insisted that revelation is\nuseless, or even counterproductive, as claimed by Abū\nḤātim. \nRecent material brought to light by Philippe Vallat (2015a, 2015b,\n2016) could confirm this interpretation. It would show that\nal-Rāzī said in debate with a theologian named Abū\nQāsim al-Balkhī, also called al-Kaʿbī, that\n“prophets are unnecessary, because we have reason which\nsuffices, assuming that prophecy is in accordance with reason”\n(on al-Kaʿbī in general see El Omari 2016; and on their\ndebate Rashed 2000, Shihadeh 2006: 103). It has however been argued\nthat Vallat’s new evidence cannot convincingly be linked to the\ndebate between al-Kaʿbī and al-Rāzī, who is never\nnamed in these texts (Adamson 2021: 148–151). A different\napproach would be to read Abū Ḥātim as having\ndistorted al-Rāzī’s position, which may have been a\nmore targeted attack on schismatic and controversialist groups\nincluding the Ismāʿīlī branch of Islam to which\nAbū Ḥātim belonged. Ismāʿīlism is\ncharacterized by its insistence on the need for a religious leader or\nimām to guide the faithful to a true understanding of\nIslam. It may have been this doctrine, and not prophecy more\ngenerally, that al-Rāzī attacked, as a signal example of the\ndangers of taqlīd (Mohaghegh 1970: 160–1; Adamson\n2021: 147). \nWhatever the case, there is no doubt that the\nIsmāʿīlīs were especially hostile to\nal-Rāzī. Alongside Abū Ḥātim\nal-Rāzī and the aforementioned Naṣīr-e Khosraw,\nwho was also an Ismāʿīlī, one may mention another\nrepresentative of this group named Ḥamīd al-Dīn\nal-Kirmānī (d. after 1020), who attacked\nal-Rāzī’s ethical teachings (Ḥamīd\nal-Dīn al-Kirmānī, see\n HDK\n in bibliography). This is not to say that only\nIsmāʿīlī authors are critical of\nal-Rāzī, though. Another opponent, who polemicizes against\nal-Rāzī’s cosmology and apparent belief in the\npossibility of transmigration (al-Rāzī, RF: 174), is the\nAndalusian jurist and philosopher Ibn Ḥazm. Also in the Western\nIslamic world, Maimonides includes a diatribe against the Razian\ntheodicy in his Guide for the Perplexed (GP: §3.12).\nThough Ibn Ḥazm associates other thinkers with\nal-Rāzī’s teachings (al-Rāzī, RF: 170 and\n174) it does not seem that his daring ideas gained much traction among\nlater philosophers. Perhaps the most productive engagement with the\nfive eternal theory is found in Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī.\nHe gives a fair hearing to al-Rāzī’s account of place\nand time, and adopts a similar view on the question of time in\nparticular (Adamson and Lammer 2020). \nIn his primary vocation of medicine, too, al-Rāzī had his\ncritics, including Ibn Sīnā, his only rival for the title of\nmost influential figure in the Islamic medical tradition. In an\nepistolary exchange with al-Bīrūnī, Ibn Sīnā\nsays that al-Rāzī overreached his competence in both\nphilosophy and medicine (“he exceeded his abilities when lancing\nabscesses and examining urine and feces”, quoted at\nal-Rāzī, RF: 290). Al-Rāzī’s project in\nDoubts was also deemed presumptuous by later medical writers,\nwho composed refutations of the work. Nonetheless,\nal-Rāzī’s works were widely consulted by doctors in\nthe Islamic world, and he had a wide diffusion in the Latin speaking\nworld under the name “Rhazes”. This began in the medieval\nperiod and persisted through the Renaissance, with sixty-seven printed\neditions of his works before 1700 (Hasse 2016: 8). No less an\nauthority than Vesalius edited an older translation of\nal-Rāzī’s Book for al-Manṣūr, and\nal-Rāzī’s medical writings were on the teaching\nsyllabus at Bologna, the most important university in Europe for\nmedical training (Siriasi 1990: 131 and 178). The independent-minded\nGirolamo Cardano, who in personality and diversity of interests was in\nsome ways the heir of Galen and al-Rāzī, praised the latter\nas one of several doctors from the Islamic world who had improved upon\nGalenic medicine through empirical observation (experimentum)\n(Siriasi 1997: 60). More recently, al-Rāzī has been praised\nfor his innovative approach and for breakthroughs in the history of\nmedicine, for example by investigating differential diagnosis\n(Iskandar 1962) and using a control group to test the efficacy of a\ndrug (Pormann 2008). Thus al-Rāzī the doctor has had a more\nillustrious posthumous career than al-Rāzī the\nphilosopher.","contact.mail":"peter.adamson@lrz.uni-muenchen.de","contact.domain":"lrz.uni-muenchen.de"}]
