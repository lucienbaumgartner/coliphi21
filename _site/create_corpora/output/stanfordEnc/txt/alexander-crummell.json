He\nstands out among his contemporaries—Frederick Douglass, Anna Julia\nCooper, Booker T. Washington, most notably—for his robust defense of\nthe central place of reason in moral agency. His attempts to work out\nthe consequences of that view for the nature of language and history\nlends his philosophy a breadth and depth not matched by other\nenlightenment thinkers. The prominence of his protégé, W.\nE. B. Du Bois, helped ensure Crummell's continuing influence during the\nrise of pragmatism, but he eventually fell out of favor as such\nrelativistic thinkers as Alain LeRoy Locke and Zora Neale Hurston\nemerged.\n\n\n\nAlexander Crummell was born free in New York City on March 3, 1819.\nHis mother, Charity Hicks of Long Island, New York, was also born free,\nwhile his father, Boston Crummell of the Temne people of West Africa,\nthough originally sold into slavery, eventually became free in\nadulthood. \n\nCoinciding with his marriage in 1841 to Sarah Mabitt Elston,\nCrummell's career as a public thinker began in earnest. His prominence\nas a young intellectual earned him a spot as keynote speaker at the\nanti-slavery New York State Convention of Negroes when it met in Albany\nin 1840. Despite race-based resistance, he successfully trained for the\npriesthood, becoming an Episcopal priest later that same decade. He\nstudied moral philosophy at Cambridge University under William Whewell,\nwhose view of moral reasoning as an intuition of necessary moral truths\nclearly influenced Crummell's own thought. After taking his bachelor's\ndegree at Queen's College at Cambridge he resumed his avid\nparticipation in the anti-slavery movement. He subsequently went to\nLiberia taking a position as a professor of English and moral\nphilosophy at Liberia College. His time there was difficult, owing to\npersonal challenges and political opposition, leading him to return to\nthe States after the Civil War. His first book was published in New\nYork, entitled The Future of Africa (1862); in it he\nsolidified much of his early thinking on morality and language. Two\nsubsequent books, The Greatness of Christ (1882) and\nAfrica and America (1891), reflected his more mature thought\non agency and moral change. \n\nHis first marriage ended when Elston died in 1878, after which he\nmarried Jennie Simpson in 1880. Late in his life he held a lectureship\nat Howard University, though his most enduring contribution to black\nAmerican letters was his co-founding of the American Negro Academy in\nWashington, DC, in 1897. He helped assemble a number of leading black\nintellectuals—including Du Bois and, much later, Locke—to publish\nresearch on problems facing blacks. During its three decades of\nexistence twenty-two papers appeared. Its disbanding in the 1920s\ncoincided with the Negro Renaissance in Harlem, the rise of Marcus\nGarvey, and the turn to pragmatism and relativism in American\nthought. \n\nCrummell died in Red Bank, New Jersey, on September 10, 1898. \n\nIt is obvious that black thinkers during the slavery era would take\nrights seriously. American slavery created a class of forced laborers\nwho possessed few legal rights. And while exceptions existed, the\ngeneral path to slavery was through the trans-Atlantic slave trade,\nvirtually ensuring that slaves were blacks. But rights in any of their\nsenses—legal, political, or even moral—are far subtler than a casual\nobserver might grasp. Let us call this the Problem of Civil Rights. \n\nThe Problem of Civil Rights concerns the question whether\nblacks (ought to) enjoy legally established guarantees, together with\ncorresponding obligations on the State. In the American federal legal\nsystem, this bifurcates—importantly, it turns out—into legal\nguarantees by and obligations on the federal government, and those by\nand on the several states. \n\nThe Civil Rights Problem arises directly for blacks who are slaves.\nGiven that they are explicitly referred to in the U.S. Constitution in\nterms of their status as forced laborers rather than in terms of\nmembership as citizens in civil society (see Article IV, for instance),\nthe courts have tended to interpret their legal rights in extremely\nnarrow terms. It will not be sufficient to merely argue, as some might\nbe tempted, that the curtailment of legal rights for blacks is\narbitrary and hence unfair. The Constitutional language (and\ncorresponding intent) is important and not easily dismissed. Moreover,\ncommon law approaches to labor and slave property in international\ncontexts is complex and sometimes conflicting, so clarity will be\ndifficult to achieve. \n\nOne hope may be to exploit the dualistic character of American\ncitizenship: inhabitants of individual states are regarded as legal\ncitizens of that state by the rules and customs of that state, and\n(separately) are regarded as citizens of the Union. If a free state\nwanted to confer citizenship and the legal rights that accrue to that\nstatus on blacks, it may do so without the interference of federal\nstatute. (Of course, the same goes for slave states.) As a theoretical\nmatter Crummell could take the approach that some freedom, if\nachievable, could provide a prima facie justification for\nbroad expansion later, leaving to the political strategists the actual\nimplementation of that expansion. \n\nHowever, a dizzying series of Supreme Court opinions—the\nAntelope (1825), the Amistad (1841), Groves v.\nSlaughter (1841), Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), and\nStrader v. Graham (1850)—culminating in the Dred Scott\nopinion (1856) helped undermine that theoretical approach. These cases\neach helped clarify the legal scope of black civil rights, in a way\ngenerally unfavorable to blacks. The rebellion on the Amistad\nwould have led to restoring kidnapped black Africans to their purported\nSpanish owners if narrow questions of international treaty obligations\nhad been read differently. The slave status of blacks was not affected\nby their transient residence in a free state, as was held in\nStrader. Fugitive slaves were presumed to be subject to\nreturn, as the Court held in Prigg, despite the somewhat\nweaker obligation of states to carry out the requisite extraditions.\nThe difficulty presented by this series of opinions is well captured by\nthe Court's interpretation of fugitive slave laws, and shows the\nheadwind against Crummell. \nIt is historically well known that the object in the clause in the\nConstitution of the United States relating to persons owing service and\nlabor in one state escaping into other states was to secure to the\ncitizens of the slaveholding States the complete right and title of\nownership in their slaves as property in every State in the Union into\nwhich they might escape from the State where they were held in\nservitude. The full recognition of this right and title was\nindispensable to the security of this species of property in all the\nslaveholding States, and indeed was so vital to the preservation of\ntheir domestic interests and institutions that it cannot be doubted\nthat it constituted a fundamental article without the adoption of which\nthe Union could not have been formed. Its true design was to guard\nagainst the doctrines and principles prevailing in the non-slaveholding\nStates by preventing them from intermeddling with or obstructing or\nabolishing the rights of the owners of slaves. (Prigg v.\nPennsylvania, 41 U.S. (16 Pet.) 539 (1842), at 540) \n\nIt is clear that, on this legal interpretation of the Constitution,\nthe civil rights of blacks are fundamentally incompatible with the\nproperty rights of citizens, as long as slavery is legal anywhere.\nWritten by Chief Justice Taney on the eve of the Civil War, the\nopinion in Scott v. Sandford (1856)—the Dred Scott\ncase—provides a most dramatic version of the narrow\nconstitutional reading of black legal rights. The Negro has no\nrights a white man is bound to respect, Taney famously concluded,\nand thus Dred and Harriet Scott, two slaves suing for their freedom,\nwere ruled ineligible to bring that suit before the Court. Moreover,\nthe problem was not confined to enslaved blacks. Not only did Taney\nconclude that blacks were not citizens, he held that they would not be\ncitizens even if freed. And no individual state could by extending\nlegal rights to blacks make them citizens of the Union proper. These\nholdings helped shut down several promising argument strategies\navailable to Crummell. \n\nCrummell's early thought in the 1840s began to respond to these\ngathering philosophical pressures on the notion of black civil rights.\nHe reasoned that if arguments in favor of rights were partial to\nblacks or otherwise based on the local conditions of black Americans,\nthen those civil rights would be subject to future retraction on\nsimilarly partial or consequentialist grounds. And in any case, public\nsympathy can be volatile and unreliable, setting up backlashes. Such\nshaky ground for legal rights for blacks would be disastrous. In\nparticular, though black service to the country created\n“favorable considerations” for the wider acceptance of\ntheir demands for justice, it remained an insufficient and\n“untenable” justification (Crummell, “New York\nConvention Address,” 202). “We object to others placing\nour rights upon complexion,” he explained, so “[w]e\nourselves [should] not lay our claims to consideration on this or any\nsimilar ground.” Only a general, rational solution can provide a\n“just and impartial guarantee” of such civil rights as\nthose protecting voting (201). Notice that Crummell is not making the\nmerely political point that rights ought not be based on the\npartiality that the public (and its duly elected representatives in\nlegislatures) might extend to blacks. He's making the stronger logical\ncase that it's the nature of rights to be non-partial. \n\nThis is the driving force of his positive solution to the Problem of\nCivil Rights—call it the Natural Rights\nArgument—which begins by asserting that rights exist, and\nnot merely in the conventional or partial sense of public\nsympathy. They have a “higher origin” and a “purer\nbirth,” as much in the sense of logical priority as in the sense\nof metaphysical independence. That is, Crummell takes the Problem of\nCivil Rights to require for its solution an appeal to rights as\nexisting prior to and independent of the legal environment in which\nsuch rights are contested and adjudicated. \n\nTo take the Amistad as an example, we might give a\nconventional, partial view of rights as taking them to be supported by\nthe sympathies of reasonable and empathetic onlookers. On that\nreading, Cinque and the other Africans who rose up and killed many of\ntheir captors had a right of self-defense, as well as a right to have\ntheir case heard in court, given the appalling circumstance of their\nkidnapping. Surely, any American would protest in just the same way if\ncaptured, and no one would think it too extreme to use whatever force\nwas required to resist kidnapping. But a reading based on a natural\nview of rights, the sort Crummell is urging, would make much of the\nfact that the right to self-defense, especially by non-Americans in\nAmerican waters, is one that attaches to persons, and not merely\ncitizens, and so is a right that pre-exists rights granted by\nlaw. Indeed, it is the obligation of law to properly capture any such\npre-existing rights from what a number of philosophers regard as our\n“natural state.” The decision might have turned out the\nsame, but the reasoning would be different. \n\nThe second step in Crummell's Natural Rights Argument holds that\nrights may be inferred from the “settled and primary\nsentiments” of human nature as well as from the “original\ngrounds of high dignities” and “exalted tendencies”\nof our common humanity (“New York\nConvention Address,” 201). This is an important part of his reasoning, in\nthat rights are not merely abstract principles applied to human\naffairs, but are derivable from our passionate and emotional\nnatures. In the previous century Hume made much of the textured moral\npersonality in his discussion of the nature of action in\nsociety. Though he would certainly not endorse Crummell's advocacy of\nnatural rights in this discussion, he would surely admire his appeal\nto the sentiments of human nature as a ground for legal and political\naction. Hume was a great champion of emotion and\npassion—“sentiments,” in that era's idiom—as part of the\nrationalizing of what we do. It is not that we can subordinate our\nactions to reason; it is that our reason can grasp what we do from our\nemotional nature and come to understand and make sense of it. Crummell\nsees this as an important part of his account. \n\nIn that way the Amistad supports a fuller interpretation\nthan might otherwise be available. Recall that on the conventional,\npartial reading, the justification for African self-defense is from\npublic sympathy for their actions. Crummell's natural rights reading\nnot only corrects that idea so that the law ought to bend to\npre-existing self-defense rights, but that those rights are inferable\nfrom our sentimental nature provides a corollary explanation of\nprecisely why public sympathy arises at all. There is little that\nnineteenth-century Americans would understand about newly arrived\nAfricans on a slave ship; they do not share language, religion, or much\nof anything else. But the deeply human response to an absurd,\ndangerous—and so clearly wrong—circumstance arouses in each\nof us the passion that was stirred in Cinque. Our sympathy arises, not\nas a condition of right, but as a consequence of it. \n\nThe third step in the Natural Rights Argument holds that any being\nendowed with the “light of reason” that exercises the\nvarious “exalted attributes” of reason possesses certain\npeculiar rights on the “ground of their nature.” This\nexplicit confidence in the powers of reason that drives the argument\nis important to Crummell, and is the main reason he and Hume do not\ntravel far together in this discussion. But Crummell needs this sort\nof rationalistic account, given that reason is our faculty for\ndiscovering such logical connections as that between circumstantial\nfact and abstract right, making it essential to the inferences that\njustify that right in human affairs. It is one thing to observe that\nsuch-and-such is the case, as one might in reviewing the facts of\nthe Amistad case. But it is quite another to articulate a\npre-existing right, abstract at least in the sense that it requires\ncalling up, even if (as Crummell claims) it has a basis in our\nsentimental nature. Presumably one needs the ability to reflect on\ngeneral principles of action, surely a subtle rational power, as well\nas the reasoning required to apply such reflection to the facts\nobserved. Such coordinated thinking and observing could then be\nbrought to cases such as the Amistad, where one could argue\nthat the general principle that holds that self-defense is permissible\napplies to these very facts. \n\nCrummell's concept of reason is thus both natural (in that\nit's derived from our natural state, pre-existing the law) and\ncategorical (in that it is to be applied to those facts and\ncircumstances that come under it, independent of political\ncontingencies), and so ought not be jeopardized by the kind of\ncontingent appeals made by adherents of conventional and partial\nviews. \n\nHis first line of defense of the Natural Rights Argument is positive,\nwhile his second is negative. The argument only succeeds if blacks in\nfact count as an instance of its third step, the generalization about\nbeings who are endowed with the light of reason.  His positive defense\nbegins by asserting that blacks “are men,” an obvious\nclaim that is certainly necessary yet insufficient to ground the\nargument. One can easily see this by noticing that a racist might\npresume that some men are unequal for being less rational, due to\ntheir race; hence more reasons are needed. Crummell thus offers what\nmay be called a Common Sympathies Premise, asserting that\nblack political sympathies “have the same being and\nnature” as those in any other group (“New York\nConvention Address,” 202). His thinking is that\nblacks have the same kinds of beliefs about political circumstances\nand desires about political interests and outcomes as any group\nwould. The inference is clear, and blacks are not only men (and\nwomen), but are men (and women) endowed with reason. Hence, blacks do\nindeed count as an instance of step one. \n\nThe argument is negatively supported by black disfranchisement, that\npolitical circumstance in which blacks were denied the right to vote.\nDisfranchisement shows that both the rights-are-inferable and\nthe rights-are-real-and-impartial premises to be violated in\nthe case of black Americans. The First Disfranchisement\nPremise states that the disfranchised condition of blacks creates\nthe “yearnings and longings for the exercise of political\nprerogatives, that are the product of the adaptedness of man's social\nnature to political arrangements, striv[ing] with irrepressible\npotency within us” (“New York\nConvention Address,” 202). Black reactions to political power\n“not proceeding from, yet operating upon” them play out as\nthey would for any population in a subordinated state, implying their\ncommon humanity. The idea behind this claim is that the negative\nreaction blacks have to the curtailment of their legal rights is\nsimilar to how any group in that circumstance would feel and react;\nhence we have another (admittedly negative) reason to take them as\nrational beings. \n\nThe Second Disfranchisement Premise argues from\ndisfranchisement to the “indignities and wrongs” resulting\ntherefrom; the “accumulated potency” of these wrongs\ngenerates “an increase and intenseness of proscription,”\nillustrating how human nature's “legitimate exercises” are\n“hindered” (“New York Convention Address,” 203). In making this point Crummell shows,\nagain, that blacks are reacting to their difficult legal and political\ncircumstance. But this time theirs is a kind of moral discomfort, an\nintense sense that a wrong is being perpetrated against them. If he is\nright, he has once again supported the Natural Rights Argument's third\npremise by showing that blacks are reasonable and hence full members\nof civil society. \n\nOn a first read the Disfranchisement Premises appear to presuppose\nthe conclusion they aim to show. They appeal to the effects of wrongs\nto make the case that blacks are fully human, and hence ought to have\ntheir civil rights protected. But whether the treatment of blacks\ncounts as a wrong is the very question at issue. Of course, in\ncontemporary legal contexts the issue doesn't even get started, since\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth amendments (ratified after the Civil War)\nprohibit the denial of civil rights to blacks. During the slavery era,\nthough, that point faced a stiff legal headwind, especially in\nslavery-related cases argued before the Supreme Court, and so positive\narguments needed to be produced. \n\nOne less-than-satisfying way to avoid this fallacy is to read the two\nPremises conditionally: if blacks enjoy full moral status, then\ndisfranchisement counts as a wrong, particularly given the\npsychological evidence of the First Disfranchisement\nPremise. This kind of reading simply takes the wrongness of\ndisfranchisement as a consequence of the condition that\nblacks are rational beings in the sense required for membership in\nsociety. That gives the argument a bit more nuance, since technically\nCrummell is not asserting that blacks have that status; he would\nsimply be supposing, as if for the sake of argument, that they do, but\nthen showing that, if they do, then the psychological state of blacks\ncounts as a harm. The problem with this reading is that it offers no\nmore than what any conditional logical proof can offer—support\nfor the conditional in question—when what one really seeks is\nsupport for the antecedent as well. It may be that the connection\nbetween condition and consequence is made, but what we really want is\nsome reason to think that the condition has indeed been satisfied in\nthe case of blacks. It is easy to construct, for instance, a\npaternalistic counter-argument on which black discomfort with their\ndisfranchisement results from exposure to abolitionist opinions. On\nthat reasoning, the obvious solution is to limit the exposure rather\nthan grant blacks the right to vote—an obviously dissatisfying\nconclusion, to say the least. \n\nA better gloss is to take the Second Disfranchisement Premise as an\nanalysis of the First: it is not merely that blacks are\npsychologically harmed by their disfranchised status, but that they\nunderstand their psychological response to political marginality as a\nmoral wrong. Hence they respond not merely to the fact of their\npolitical weakness, but also to the denial it represents of their moral\ncharacter and efficacy qua moral. This route is more robust,\nsince it recognizes in blacks a complex moral interpretation of the\nharm they are suffering, which presupposes the condition the\nearlier rendering could only stipulate. That presupposition is\nvirtuous, though, since the psychological facts in question are\nverifiable, and if they hold, they directly establish the moral status\nin question. Moreover, paternalism is forestalled, since a moral\njudgment by blacks of their own condition counts as prima\nfacie evidence that they are moral agents capable of such\njudgments. \n\nCrummell's conclusion follows directly, and black Americans are\njustified in claiming “equal and entire rights” with other\ncitizens “on the ground of our common humanity”\n(“New York Convention Address,” 203). \n\nThe Natural Rights Argument is bold and brisk in the way a young\nthinker's first serious foray into moral argument is apt to be. While\nsomewhat programmatic, it nevertheless provides the logical framework\nhe needs to address moral questions about blacks. Surely they are owed\na remedy for civil-rights violations if they are the proper bearers of\nsuch rights, for instance. And they would presumably forfeit any such\nremedy if they expatriated to Africa, Canada, or Europe, places many\nactivists were urging them to resettle to. Hence the value of his\nreasoning for practical responses to problems in black life. However,\nthe argument runs up several philosophical debts. First, is the moral\nreasoning by which rights are justified some special precinct of a more\ngeneral kind of reasoning? What does this show about the metaphysical\nbasis of normative concepts? Second, the Crummellian moral philosopher\nowes the reader an account of human nature, since rights are inferred\nfrom it. Moreover, both the Common Sympathies Premise and the\nDisfranchisement Premises turn on some broader psychology of agency.\nWhat does that look like? And third, how can the timeless character of\nmoral concepts like rights be reconciled with the evolving character of\nthe human condition—the progress from slavery to freedom, for\ninstance? Much of Crummell's more mature moral philosophy attempts to\npay these debts; they are discussed in turn below. \n\nThe central issue running through all of these concerns of Crummell's\nderives from the nature of moral reason itself. He describes the\nstructure of the human psyche as consisting of instinct, passion, and\nreason, with reason taking priority over the other two. Reason is a\n“universal and native sentiment,” a “deep-felt\nknowledge,” and “reflexive recognition of truth,”\nall of which are “spontaneous” abilities, contrasted with\nthe externally conditioned instinct and passion (“Eulogy for\nThomas Sidney” (July 1840) [AC], 3). Spontaneous reason is opposed to reason that\ncomes from efforts to exert “intellectual and moral\npowers.” Hence the need for educational and religious training,\nhe thought, the aim of which was to allow the individual agent\n“to perceive intuitively ‘those awful truths, those\neternal principles.’ ” His view of moral reason takes\nas morally exemplary the well-honed natural intuition of timeless\nmoral principles. \n\nPlato is an easy antecedent to identify in his thinking, as Crummell\nbiographers Gregory Rigsby and Wilson Jeremiah Moses both attest. But\nCrummell's emphasis on spontaneous, unconflicted reason also evokes\nAristotelian themes. That makes it a challenge to situate him in the\nhistory of philosophy. \n\nPlato held a view about moral thinking that depended on seeing the\nobjects of moral thought as abstract, pre-existing entities. One can\nalready see in Crummell's Natural Rights Argument (discussed above) a\nstrong Platonic streak. It clearly continues here in his idea that\nmoral agents intuit timeless principles. Plato pursued this idea far\nenough to conclude that such principles, as unchanging, were precisely\nthe sorts of entities that could underwrite moral conversation and\nreflection. In fact, without them moral action and thinking would be\nunstable and constantly shifting—as he would put it, becoming\nwhat it might finally be, but not actually being that\nthing. Fortunately on the Platonic approach, timeless abstract moral\nprinciples always are, and so never need to be further\nstabilized or justified. \n\nBut Crummell's approach evokes Aristotle as well. The Aristotelian\nelements are especially distinctive, given that Aristotle's thinking\nabout morality was so strongly driven by his attempts to repair (what\nhe regarded as) flaws in Plato's thinking. Aristotle thought that\nmorality could not be theorized about since it is, by its nature, practical. That is, we work out what we need to do in our\nmoral lives, and even though we think about what that\ninvolves, our goal is not merely to gain understanding of some abstract\nmoral principle, but to do some action. \n\nAristotle thus took the habits of moral character very\nseriously—much more so than the theoretical deliberations of the\nPlatonist—an emphasis Crummell seems to share in his admiration of his\nfriend Sidney. He admires him for his naturalness at moral life,\nrequiring no effort to intuit the morally relevant features of a\nsituation. After all, if effort is required, then one does not yet have\nthe habits of virtue, thus coming up short on the Aristotelian metric.\nIf Sidney is thus admirable for lacking any weakness of will, it is\neasy to suppose that effort-driven reason is a mark of such weakness,\nand hence something to be avoided (or at best tolerated) until moral\nexcellence is achieved. Crummell's view thus seems less a Platonic\nideal of moral excellence than an Aristotelian tolerance of moral\nfailure. This is apt given the compromised agency that any observer\nwould discern in the moral condition of enslaved blacks. What Crummell\nadmired in Sidney is his working out of the two, a kind of excellence\nin the face of compromised agency. \n\nCrummell's notion depends on the existence of a set of fundamental\nprinciples. Deeply unsettled moral situations, in which competing\nconsiderations press on the choices actual individuals make, demand\nthat the principled individual discern the moral signal in all the\nnoise. His central idea is that reason cuts through to the principles\nthemselves, even if moral and mental effort is required to get clarity\nabout those principles. He takes providence to make that clarity and\nprogress possible. Hence his view is less dependent on the unsettled\nnature of situations in producing the moral dialectic, and instead\nderives from the tracking of a fundamental principle. \n\nCrummell is acutely aware that the linguistic resources of a moral\nagent help determine how fully they can reason morally and thus be\ncapable of the agency that draws on the principles he\ndescribes. Though he is grossly unfair to the West African language\nGrebo, his argument that it is logically inadequate to serve the\nrational needs of blacks in Liberia who speak it offers an instructive\naccount of the interplay between language and thought. There is little\nhe likes about Grebo: it is “harsh, abrupt, energetic, and\nindistinct in enunciation,” he says, “meagre in point of\nwords” and “abound[ing] with inarticulate nasal and\nguttural sounds” (“The English Language in Liberia”\n[FA], 19). It “possess[es] few inflections and\ngrammatical forms” and hence is “exceedingly difficult of\nacquisition.” He feels he cannot urge Liberians to continue to\nspeak Grebo instead of English, given his conclusions that it is\nplagued by “lowness of ideas, with brutal and vindictive\nsentiments” and with “principles” that show a\npredominance of “animal propensities.” This is a disaster,\nhe writes, since (on this description) it can support few moral\nconcepts or distinctions, let alone concepts germane to justice and\npolitics, or even “truths of a personal, present deity”\nand “God's moral government.” His theoretical worries\nconcern what the “principles” of a natural-language\nvariety are that account for its various logical capacities, such as\nexpressibility and generativity. \n\nCrummell does not think he is being prejudicial here, despite the\nextreme linguistic bias any modern-day reader would take him to be\ndisplaying. He relies on John L. Wilson's description of\nGrebo—something of a standard ethnography of his day—and so to a\ngreat extent is engaging in a positivistic rather than impressionistic\naccount of Grebo. Of course, any present-day language study would rely\non descriptions systematically developed from the judgments of native\nspeakers rather than non-native observations. And his positivism has\nits theoretical basis in arguments familiar from John Locke's\nphilosophy of language. Words are the names of thoughts, and so\narticulations in language are in effect mnemonic devices for thinking.\nHis regard for reason would certainly lead him to emphasize a\npriori concepts, but the theoretical assumptions are largely due\nto Locke. \n\nLocke's philosophy of language—which he shared in its broad\noutlines with predecessors Hobbes and Descartes—holds that thoughts in\nthe mind, whether they are innate (he thought they mostly were not) or\ncaused by the sensations we have, are the primary support for the words\nin our language. When we utter a word, we do so because that word\nmeans the idea we have in mind when we utter it. The Grebo\nanalysis that Crummell offers takes Lockean philosophy seriously, in\nthat if Grebo has “defects,” it is because it is not able\nto preserve the word-idea relationship in moral contexts. Though this\nprejudice about Grebo is unfounded, the theory driving the prejudice\nenjoyed wide acceptance. \n\nIt is tempting to see Crummell's philosophy of language in terms of\nHumboldt's work in the decades prior on comparative grammars rather\nthan Locke's empiricist semantics. Humboldt compared linguistic\nvarieties in order to discover patterns across those variations, the\nidea being that linguistic universals occur throughout human\nexperience, if only we can capture the common patterns. Crummell can\nthus be read as Humboldtian, albeit an illiberal and intolerant one.\nThat may turn out to be a productive reading, but little historical\nevidence has yet been uncovered to show that Crummell knew of\nHumboldt. \n\nIn any case, his theoretical commitments led him to be suspicious of\nGrebo's ability to support moral discourse, since he thinks it is\nunreliable. The situation is especially urgent for the kinds of\npre-existing principles that form the (abstract, unchanging) objects\nof moral conversation. For those are a priori by\nnature—they exist independently of the experiences about which\nwe might converse.  As such, there is that much greater a burden on\nmoral language for a Lockean like Crummell, since a speaker could not\nrely on their sensations to support the language they are using. They\nneed to have strong powers of memory as part of their faculty of\nreason, recalling the timeless a priori principles to be\napplied to these current facts. (Plato makes a similar point\nin The Republic, observing the importance of memory in moral\nreasoning and philosophy, especially in the training of the guardian\nclass.) This helps inform his view that blacks ought to adopt English\nas a remedy for the linguistic “defects” he thinks plagues\nGrebo. The ability of English to preserve the complex logical\nstructure of abstract moral reasoning (given its syntactic and\nsemantic structure) recommends it, as well as its infinite\nproductivity. \n\nA broader question arises here. By concentrating on purported\ndeficits of rationality of Africans in particular, and blacks in\ngeneral, as opposed to examining its causes (say, slavery and race\ndiscrimination), isn't the analysis misplaced? After all, if the causes\nof diminished cognitive resources are political and historical, then\nany proposed remedy would presumably have to offset (if not remove)\nthose causes. One could go even further (as Crummell easily could) and\nargue that if cognitive resources are diminished due to\nmorally pernicious causes, then moral progress will\nbe stymied unless and until a just accounting of those causes has been\nmade, and remedies are carried out. \n\nOne could read Crummell's various arguments about posterity and\nmoral change (below), as well as his case for black civil rights\n(above), as a vindication of this idea. He may be interpreted as making\na moral case for black progress and civilization precisely as\na moral offset to the moral harm that has plagued blacks. But the\nsticking point in that interpretation would be his understanding of\nlanguage and cognition. If his goal is to provide a moral counterweight\nto discrimination and its effects, it seems he hasn't pursued it\nthrough all of its effects—specifically those that concern cognition\nand linguistic ability. He is quite unsparing in his analysis of civil\nrights; why wouldn't he also articulate his case in terms of language\nand reasoning, if that was his real purpose? And the complaint implicit\nin the question stands as a criticism. \n\nIt may be that Crummell thought moral criticism of this sort was\nappropriate, but doubted that cognitive deficit could be due to such an\noppressive history. Rarely did he ascribe any black shortcoming to\nlingering effects of slavery, other than in the very broadest of terms.\nIt is likely, given how much is presently understood about\nenvironmental factors in linguistic development, and how little was\nknown then, that it didn't seem plausible to him to think there was any\ncausal connection between slavery and cognitive resources. \n\nWhatever the right interpretation, his view of the nature of\ncivilization will figure into his thinking. Crummell saw each\ngeneration as having an obligation to posterity, namely, to contribute\nto civilization, much the way a farmer has to work the soil to produce\na harvest; failure to do so leads to the death of the land, so to\nspeak, and the same is true for civilization. To contribute, though,\nrequires resources (cognitive and linguistic ones included), cultivated\nin a public discourse that makes value and meaning, held among common\npeople, from which intellectuals emerge and draw. (This anticipates Du\nBois' “talented tenth” idea.) Crummell thought blacks, devastated by\nslavery, were severely incapacitated and hence couldn't produce in the\ngeneral population the seeds for that intellectual emergence and\ncivilization. One response could be to assign blame for this woeful\nstate of affairs, as just discussed. Crummell would certainly not\ndisagree that hindrances to blacks led to this cultural derailment and\nsubsequent defect (as he saw it). But his concern was with the\nresources themselves: how could blacks regroup and make up lost ground?\nHence his preoccupation with the cognitive resources rather than with\naccusation and protest. (The activist Douglass provides a ready\ncontrast.) \n\nWhile language-deficiency theories have since been discredited,\nCrummell's language analysis remains valuable for its attempt to\ndescribe the work that the deep features of the grammar of the\ncolloquial English commanded by American blacks play in reasoning and\ndiscourse. \n\nThe principles of moral reasoning and discourse require effective\ncausation in order to realize agency. In a series of closely related\narguments—the Mental Principle Argument, the Moral Principle\nArgument, and the Memory versus Recall Argument—Crummell begins\nto describe this relationship. According to his Mental Principle\nArgument, the god worshipped by a people elevates or debases them\nsince “the abstract principle that the idea of God contains,\ninherently, such transforming power in a nation, that it makes or\nunmakes, according as it is clear, and right, and grand; or, on the\nother hand, is low, and rude, and sensual” (“God and the\nNation” [FA], 154). “National greatness”\ncorrelates with these ideas, a point he thinks is obvious.  While\nthought may be the spur to enterprise and organized society, the\n“generative principle” of the “active power and\nactivity” of mind is the idea of God (155). It is not that God\nsimply determines which actions and events occur, but that the idea of\nGod causes human thought to generate the varied activities of civil\nsociety, and so “magnifies a nation's mind” leading to\n“development in every mode and direction” (158). Being\noriented to the future in turn leads individuals to make an enduring\nnation that can survive them. Crummell is convinced that blacks are\nwell suited to legacy-building because of their “plastic”\nnature possessing that “native mobility and adaptedness”\nrequired to withstand “elements diverse from and stronger than\ntheir own”; blacks are patient enough “to wait for the\nfuture, in calm abidance and with confident assurance”\n(“Hope for Africa” [FA], 321). He rejects the\ncounter-argument that individuals are mortal, and since nations are\nsimply aggregates of individuals they are likewise mortal. Over and\nabove such aggregates nations are societies “in an organized\nstate, under the influence and control of broad principles and\nsuperior ideas” (“God and the Nation,”\n161). Reason's activity is civilizing, leading directly to a further\nprogressive development of that reason. \n\nAccording to Crummell's Moral Principle Argument, just as the\nmigration of populations is a fact of human life, occurring throughout\nhuman history, so too is the moral history of meaning and action that\nis built up around it. He takes this to be providential, not\naccidental. We may “discover evidences of a large and\ncomprehensive plan, which excludes all ideas of the accidental or\nadventitious” (“Emigration, an Aid to the Civilization of\nAfrica” [AA], 412). Human events in general accord with\nGod's “grand moral economy” in which God is an\n“ever-active agent” (413). Crummell acknowledges that\n“our finite vision” often “fail[s] the\ndiscovery” of genuine moral ends. Consistent with his\ndeontological understanding of moral obligation, as well as his\nrealism about the moral, the effort to discover and examine moral ends\nby the reasoning agent is essentially an application of our mental\nfaculties to scrutable moral problems, a mental task assigned by\nGod. As the active, directing force and principle, the will of God\n“overrules all the deeds, the counsels, and the designs of men,\nand tracks them from their unseen germs, …to those manifest and\nnotable deeds which rank among historic facts” (413). \n\nHence a link between the Moral Principle Argument and the Mental\nPrinciple Argument: an active principle of thought causes action, is\nthe subject of history, and has God as its source. If those deeds are\ngood, then they are God-caused (regardless of any purported\ncausal contribution by the agent). God supplies the suggestion,\nadjustment, direction, and order of the deeds “so that while men act on\ntheir own personal responsibility, they nevertheless act either\nconsciously or unconsciously as the agents of God” (414). Thus we\ncannot override God's will. And if those deeds are evil, then they are\nGod-exploited, since God distracts that which is evil and\ndirects us to providentially approved ends. To the counter-argument\nthat God is not concerned with secular history, Crummell argues that\nthat would imply that there exists some non-God that governs the\nsecular, thus dividing “the moral government of God,” an absurdity. In\nany case, God's hand is evident throughout history. A moral vanguard is\nto respond in an active way to Mental and Moral Principles and affect\nthe course of history, thereby increasing the civilization potential of\nthose principles for future generations. “The hand of God is on the\nblack man, in all the lands of his distant sojourn, for the good of\nAfrica” (“Emigration,” 421); God thus intervenes in history and uses blacks as his\nagents, creating an additional impetus for blacks to affect history's\ncourse. Crummell is a moral vanguardist in this way, since an advance\n“remnant” of the people does the work of God. \n\nHis Memory versus Recall Argument reveals the limitations of\nsuch vanguards. He recounts in his 1891 book Africa and\nAmerica a sharp public exchange he has with Douglass over the\neffect of actively recalling how slavery degraded black\nlife. Douglass, ever the activist, thought such recall was\ninspirational, motivating moral progress, while the relentlessly\nanalytical Crummell thought it dispiriting and morally regressive. He\ndecried what he saw as the “irresistible tendency in the Negro\nmind in this land to dwell morbidly and absorbingly upon the servile\npast” to the detriment of the needs of the future. Active recall\nof slavery, he argued, jeopardized black moral progress (“The\nNeed of New Ideas and New Aims for a New Era” [AA],\n18–19). Of course it “is not the memory of slavery”\nto be guarded against “but the constant recollection of it, as\nthe commanding thought of a new people, who should be marching on to\nthe broadest freedom of thought in a new and glorious present, and a\nstill more magnificent future.” Memory is passive, as “the\nnecessary and unavoidable entrance, storage and recurrence of facts\nand ideas to the understanding and the consciousness.” But\nrecollection is a mental action, “the actual seeking of the\nfacts, …the painstaking endeavor of the mind to bring them back\nagain to consciousness.” By the “law of\nassociation,” then, it tends to “degradation.” \n\nLanguage plays a central role in this process, echoing the point he\nmakes about the English language in Africa. “Words are vital\nthings,” explained Crummell, since they are “always\ngenerative of life or death” and cannot “enter the soul as\npassive and inoperative things” (19).  Moreover, to be limited\nin word and thought is to undermine moral reasoning, which is the\ncondition of the “savage.” On the other hand, the\n“changed circumstances” of blacks generate “an\nimmense budget of new thoughts, new ideas, new projects, new purposes,\nnew ambitions, of which our fathers never thought”\n(19–20). \n\nLike other enlightenment thinkers, Crummell takes posterity very\nseriously, urging his contemporaries to moral action that will create a\nlegacy that later generations will both enjoy and emulate. His\nreasoning is relatively straightforward, pivoting on the idea that the\nmain conceptual artifact of a people is their national culture. \n\nNational culture captures a complex idea for Crummell. On the\none hand, he argues that each generation has a duty to the\nfuture—specifically, a duty to make the future better than the\npast—an obligation he often described in terms of\n“civilization.” Civilization thus accumulates all of the\ngreatest symbolic achievements of the past: literature, philosophy,\nthe arts, and so on. But that does not happen\nwithout cultivating the population whose symbolic\nachievements are thus collected. What we would today call\nculture, with little or none of his idea of progress and\nimprovement, Crummell and his contemporaries thought of as that\nwhich is so cultivated, and hence is prepared to add to\ncivilization. But while civilization is for everyone—it is\nuniversal, Crummell would say—culture is particular to this or that\ngroup, this or that nation. National culture is thus that set\nof symbolic achievements made by a particular (national) group for the\ngood of universal (world) civilization. The Negro, in the idiom of\nCrummell's day, has no less obligation than any other “nation” to make\na cultural contribution to civilization.  \n\nHe understands moral change, in part, as a condition for such a\nculture to be possible, so it is not surprising that he recognizes a\ncollective duty to satisfy that condition. His is a particularly\naggressive account, in that the duties to posterity are categorical and\nuniversal, setting the price blacks have to pay to affect the course of\nhistory. \n\nHistory, to Crummell's mind, is the series of events that concerns the\nprogress of civilization. As various groups produce their symbolic\ninstitutions, and as those national cultures improve humanity's state\nof civilization, forward progress is being achieved, and the\nback-and-forth of ordinary life is getting closer to achieving the\nfundamental pre-existing nature of things as they really are. Crummell\nclearly subscribes (as did Plato) to a strong version of this view of\nhistory. On Plato's version, the ordinary events we now simply call\n“history”—wars, recessions, presidential elections,\netc.—are part of the changing world of approximations and\ninexactness. As such, they are in flux, becoming one thing after\nanother, but never actually being anything permanent. But the\npre-existing principles that underwrite moral reasoning are timeless\nand unchanging—and hence permanent.  History cannot be about\nwhat is transient, despite the passage of time it implies; rather, it\nis about what endures through the passage of time. \n\nThis is actually not as foreign to contemporary notions as it may\nseem. True, we keep a historical record, which is meant to keep track\nof the affairs of human societies, without prejudice or interpretation.\nBut the record we keep is updated as we begin to grasp the impact the\nrecorded events have on the future and what we take to be our\ncollective destiny. Consider the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. The\ninitial event was confusing because, though devastating, it was not\nclear whether its impact was on foreign policy and affairs of state\n(that is, whether it was an act of war) or on domestic policy and\ncriminal justice (that is, whether it was a criminal act), a question\nthat still seems unsettled. Of course, there is no controversy about\nthe fact that some event occurred. It is that we do not (yet)\nhave a settled description of those facts; hence the history\nof that event is not yet written. Indeed, history in our day is very\nmuch an assessment of the record in light of our future, an uncertain\nand ongoing conversation by a nation about itself. \n\nCrummell is more modern than Plato, in the sense that he orients the\nquestion of history from the perspective of the nation and its culture\nthat is trying to understand its place with respect to civilization.\nFor Plato, the orientation is that of the universal truths—we might\nsay it is cosmic—and so our response to them is more derivative and\nsecondary. Plato might say that the Negro is trying to engage the\ntimeless truths of civilization in order to realize what the true\nnature of reality is like. Crummell would emphasize instead that it is\nthe Negro who helps make that reality present itself to us as it\ndoes—its timeless nature is timeless, to be sure, but it is a central\ncharacter in the drama of history in our moment and as we\nsee it. It is in our time that it will act, just as it is in our\ntime that we will bring about the progress to be achieved. \n\nThe Argument from Posterity begins with Crummell's\nobservation that individuals have some “relation” to the\n“entire race”; “a nation is a collection of\nmen…of the same make, and nature, and appetencies, and destiny,\nas ourselves” comprising but a “section of the great\ncommonwealth of humanity, a phase of the common type of being, and no\nmore” (“The Duty of a Rising Christian State”\n[FA], 59–60). The moral moment in our common destiny is\nto “go forward and upward” (63). The movement of national\nculture through time is thus singular (neither multiple nor\ndiverse, even if diversely contributed to), progressive\n(movement leads to improvement), and ultimately unifying. It\nis as if “all the preceding generations of mankind, and all the\nvarious nations, have lived for every successive generation,”\nsuggesting that there is “no absolute disseverance of individual\nnations” (63–64). \n\nKant's insistence that human history is the working out of\n“nature's plan” to realize the full natural capacities of\nhumans in society anticipates Crummell's social progressivism\n(“Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan\nPurpose,” proposition 8). For Kant the ultimate goal was the\nperfect form of civil society; so too for Crummell, though his vision\nreserves a central driving role to the character of agents, moreso\nthan to the justice of actions. This shouldn't be overstated of\ncourse. Kant clearly regarded enlightenment as a triumph of\n“culture” over “barbarism” as he took it to be\nthe generalizing of principles of justice. But Crummell's\nunderstanding of the duty to posterity seems much more entangled with\nthe fidelity of the Negro to Moral Principles than the\njustice of those Principles. \n\nIf Crummell is more modern than Plato, Kant's view of historical\nprogress is more modern than Crummell's. Though both Kant and Crummell\nsee and evaluate the sweep of historical events from the standpoint of\na particular group or individual, Kant thought that the kind of\nsignificant history Crummell worried about blacks contributing to was\nnot even possible without robust self-awareness. It is only when\nsomeone can reason about their actions by observing them\nlogically—that is, as a rational law-giver might—that\nself-awareness has been minimally achieved. So for Kant the ultimate\nobligation of a modern society is to preserve such moral autonomy;\nindeed, it is an important condition for enlightenment. \n\nCrummell's philosophy is less modern than Kant's given Crummell's\ninsistence on the importance of one's racial nature in helping create\nthe conditions for morality and history (cf. Kirkland\n1992–1993). The duty Crummell has in mind is to the Mental and\nMoral Principles that comprise progressive reason. It has little to do\nwith whatever group one belongs to, though one's contribution is at\nleast partly determined by the national character of their people or\nrace. In any case the progress of reason is the moral determiner;\n“our life, our culture, and our civilization are but the result\nof the ceaseless energy of mind and body of all past nations”\n(“Rising Christian State,” 64). This all furthers the effort to “cultivate men,”\nnurturing “that largeness of soul—that quick, glad\nrecognition of noble principles—that love of and reverence for\nfixed and eternal truth—that eager desire for the work of\nlife” (74). This is a prerequisite for a national culture, since\nnations need “citizens with large, expanded minds, a fine\nculture, with natural or acquired manners, and a constant delicate\nhonor” (74). There is a collective duty to enhance the\ncivilizing potential of civilizing rational principles because of its\npotential to further civilize in the future, something that is\nintrinsically valuable. The associated duty to the land of one's\nfathers is implied by a duty of self-respect, given the common\n“negro blood flowing in his veins” (“The Relations\nand Duty of Free Colored Men” [FA], 219). This duty is\nall the more urgent because of Africa's “benightedness,”\nand it is all the more binding because of the Kantian focus on\nnature's plan, understood in social context. Crummell appeals here to\nthe self-regard of black Americans—“in its normal state\nand in its due degree… ‘is as just and morally good as\nany affection whatever’ ” (221, Crummell quoting\nButler)—to motivate their sense of duty to black Africans. \n\nIt is hard to read Crummell and not recall the problem of evil that\nhaunts providential philosophies of history. If history unfolds as God\nsees fit, then why do such devastating historical wrongs as American\nslavery occur? It seems that either God is unable to prevent\nsuch wrongs (but isn't God all-powerful?), God is unaware that\nthey are occurring (but isn't God all-knowing?), or that God is\nunwilling to stop such wrongs (but isn't God all-good?). None\nof those options is available to the providential philosopher of\nhistory, since if God lacked any one of those traits then he cannot be\nthe God that drives history. Instead, he would be as we are, characters\ntrying to impact the course of history. \n\nCrummell has a few responses to this problem. One is the classic\nreply of theists, that God allows evil passively, and does so with\ncharacter-building and moral instruction in mind. And of course\nCrummell is acutely aware that humans are capable of great moral evil.\nIt is not so much that God is unable to stop evil as that humanity is\nso able at propagating it. \n\nBut there's another kind of response that can be teased out of\nCrummell. His is a Platonic metaphysics, so for him reality is that\nunchanging pre-existing world of fundamental principles and concepts.\nThat which is good is so due to the unchanging (and unrealized in the\neveryday world) nature of that which is good in itself. A sophisticated\nPlatonist with a theistic overlay like Crummell sees evil only when the\ngood in itself has been corrupted, which is impossible since\nthe good is an abstract timeless object. Of course there is suffering\nin our shadowy transient realm; that is regrettable in the strongest\nterms possible. But that is due to our imperfect grasp of the timeless\nnature of the good. It is the good itself which persists, accounting\nfor our achievement of a better future. The problem of evil is thus a\nkind of misdirection; the real issue is the problem of our ignorance of\nthe good, which indicts us, not God. \n\nCrummell's Kantian point helps make his larger argument clearer in\nanother way as well. The progressivism that both thinkers urged is\nrooted in a common view about nature's endowing humans with various\ncapacities. While for Kant that positions the argument for the\nprogress of reason, Crummell sees it widening the ensemble of factors\ntoward progress. For instance, commerce is praised for the civilizing\nrole it plays, and yet, as he observes, the slave trade (clearly\na destructive force) was the main commercial activity in Africa. Given\nthe natural resources of West Africa, that could easily be\nchanged. The “acquisitive principle” combined with\nproductive labor can lead to civilization, “uplift[ing] and\nenlighten[ing] the heathen!” (“Duty of Free Colored Men,” 229–30).  This is an\nopportunity that should not be squandered. “If the black\nman…civilized and enlightened” enjoys “a golden\nheritage, and fails to seize upon and to appropriate it, Providence\nnone the less intends it to be seized upon and wills it to be\nused,” implying that whites who capitalize on the opportunity to\ncreate wealth would be justified (231). The heart of the argument is\ncommerce's ability to create conditions for order and comfort from\ndisorder and wildness.  Moral consequences follow, including the\ndesire for industry, the need for planning, and the creation of future\nchances for increased wealth.  Self-reliance thus occupies a central\nplace as a primary virtue of the civilized; the principle of\nacquisition and the efforts it generates at self-support and\nself-reliance lead to profitable commerce and investment, ultimately\ngenerating moral improvement, all in keeping with\nprovidence. “[B]lack men in Africa must do what enterprising men\ndo in all other new lands: they must BEND NATURE TO THEIR WANTS AND\nWISHES” (253). Of course this confidence in the moral\nimprovement conferred by labor and industry was widely held—by\nKant too—but in Crummell's thinking it is inextricably rooted in\nAfrica as well as the agrarian American South, and so the civilizing\nthat he thought blacks needed required an investment in lands they\nfound themselves in, or had an original bond to. \n\nLiberia crystallizes these strands of argument; its founders sought to\nestablish a “civilized nationality” there, as Crummell\ndescribes it (“The Responsibility of the First Fathers of a\nCountry” [AA], 132). That was their “tremendous\nresponsibility” and “great obligation,” namely,\n“to act as worthy trustees of distant generations and of future\ntimes.” They exemplified what he thinks is required to fulfill\nthe duty to future progress. What remains is the need to link\n“sentiment” and “outward forms and symbols”\n(134); such is the substance of national cultures. Civil government is\nnot the main site of this experiment in making a national culture, but\nits structure matters since “man's opportunities for personal\nfreedom, for intellectual advancement, for social comfort, for\ndomestic bliss, and for religious growth, depend very measurably upon\nhis civil status” (135). The nature of this dependence runs\ndeep, and may even be organic: “an ennobled manhood and the\nmasculine virtues are generally the fruits of distinct national\nsystems”; “the spirit of a people and their form of\ngovernment are mostly reciprocal; …for the higher kind of human\ncharacter, you are forced to seek an analogy of rule and system as its\nparent.” This underwrites a sorting of national cultures.\n“All the art, the refinement, the magnificence of Paris [will]\nfail to realize that ideal of human government which is the aspiration\nof every free soul,” he writes, “and which is an essential\nelement in the growth of free and manly character” (136). But we\nare political agents, and this culture is something we need to take an\nactive role in making. We are creators in the sense that we can act in\nan unconstrained way. But the range of choices of government is\nlimited to free or repressive; one or the other must come to be. He\nargues that that is a matter of necessity since, “according\nto the constitution of things, no other political systems than\nthese can exist” (137). It is our choosing that\ndetermines which comes to be. He obviously endorses a free civil\ngovernment, and his posing of a choice to his audience in keeping with\nhis set-up of the question is meant to make the point that free\ngovernment is preferable because it leads to human flourishing. It is\nless a political philosophy than a social and moral philosophy; the\ninstitutions that make our collective social efforts effective ought\nto be free in order to enable us to become civilized, noble, and\nenlightened, leading to “a system which will enlarge the souls\nof men” and “give them manhood and superiority”\n(139). A free system thus “distinguishes calm Republicanism from\nwild and lawless Democracy.” The institutional framework of\naction thus creates the space for the individual moral life, that\n“good” life one tries to make for oneself.  Such a system\n“starts men in the race for improvement…seeks their moral\nelevation, and aims to strengthen their souls” (140). \n\nIt is clear that Crummell thinks races ought to make nations as\ntheir instrument of civilizing uplift, but it is nowhere evident that\nhe thinks races are the objects of that uplift. Instead, civilization\nis a good in itself, and ought to frame the political goals of a free\nnation. The principle that makes this go is “that organic principle\nof being which binds the present to the future, under a sense of duty\nand responsibility” (“First Fathers,” 141). He isn't shy at any point in his\nanalysis. The problem of moral flourishing is one that has a\npolitical-institution component, but it is just as obvious to him that\nit has a metaphysical component, namely the linkage through time of\nhuman actions and how they bear on future effects. “According to the\norganization of our being,” he observes, “we are unable to confine\nourselves to the mere brief period of life allotted us in this world.\nNo man can thus make his life a disconnected, isolated unit” (141).\nThis part of the argument proceeds in several stages. First, since\nhuman action is diachronic, so too is human agency. And second, since\nhuman kinds (races) have a cultural and moral component, agency is not\nwithout contextualizing factors, as “one generation is, of necessity,\nthe framer and shaper of both the character and the destiny of another”\n(145–46). This obligates present agents since “the character of a\npeople is a continuous and integral quality” shared by ancestor and\ndescendant alike. Hence Crummell lays the groundwork for his moral\nprogressivism, especially as it applies to blacks. The remaining\ndifficulty is to explain how moral change is possible. \n\nCrummell's Moral Change Argument begins with a tension. He\nclaims that moral enlightenment cannot be caused by non-enlightenment.\nNo “rude, heathen people” have ever “raised\nthemselves by their own spontaneous energy” to a “morally\nelevated” state, he argues (“The Regeneration of\nAfrica” [AA], 435); the efforts of those\n“superior” in “letters or grace” are generally\nrequired. This implies that moral enlightenment cannot be\nindigenous. Against this restriction on the cause of enlightenment is\nhis concern that, to be effective, the enlightening influence has to\nbecome indigenous. The heathen cannot enlighten themselves,\nyet, since no one can become enlightened by non-indigenous agents,\nenlightened agents have to become indigenous—that is, some\nheathen have to be enlightened—as a condition for the\nenlightenment of the heathen. So how can any heathen be enlightened,\nunless they are already enlightened? \n\nCrummell is not pessimistic though, since religious conversion faces\nsimilar obstacles, and often succeeds despite them. The “employment of\nall indigenous agency,” he announces, is that “great principle which\nlies at the basis of all successful propagation of the Gospel” (437).\nThe solution to the dilemma is for the enlightened to be racially and\npsychologically similar to the would-be enlightened. “[M]en of like\nsentiments, feelings, blood and ancestry” are required for moral\nenlightenment, and hence are necessary for moral change. It is\nintriguing that his analysis does not demand affinity of\nthought between the enlightened and the target for moral\nimprovement, a condition it seems reasonable to insist on. Sentiments\nand feelings go to sympathy, whereas blood and ancestry go to racial\nsimilarity; neither is mental. Interestingly, the collision between\nrestricted cause and restricted effect amplifies the importance of\nmoral reason's indifference to this or that race's particular nature,\neven as it is put to use in precisely those situations where such\ndifferences are definitive (racial contact most notably). \n\nRaising the stakes for moral change is Crummell's belief that no\nsingle individual ever accomplished anything epochal; “everywhere\nwe find that the great things of history have been accomplished by\nthe combination of men” (“The Social Principle Among a People”\n[DR], 31). This is also the case for such moral achievements\nas abolishing slavery. It took “the masses of the godly” to be\n“marshaled to earnest warfare” to create moral change on a grand\nscale (32). Thus, significant moral change occurs only in the context\nof social efforts. This is natural given the Social Principle,\nas Crummell calls it: that “disposition which leads men to\nassociate and join together for specific purposes; the principle\nwhich makes families and societies, and which binds men in unity and\nbrotherhood, in races and churches and nations” (31). We are social by\nnature, since our native “sympathies and affections” are the source of\nour “desire for companionship.” And this can't be opted out of: we were\n“formed” with “a fitness and proclivity for association, …a\nnature that demanded society.” \n\nThe Social Principle's transcendental role in moral change can be\nproblematic though. For instance, it is easy to sense in Crummell's\ndescription Du Bois' famous dialectic between two forms of black\nconsciousness, decades before he stated it. Here is how Crummell puts\nit: \nWe are living in this country, a part of its population, and\nyet, in divers respects, we are as foreign to its inhabitants as though\nwe were living in the Sandwich Islands. It is this our actual\nseparation from the real life of the nation, which constitutes us “a\nnation within a nation”: thrown very considerably upon ourselves for\nmany of the largest interests of life, and for nearly all our social\nand religious advantages. (“Social Principle,” 32) \n\nLike the Du Boisian struggle—and echoing Kant's description of\nthe antagonism inherent in “unsociable sociability”\n(“Idea for a Universal History”)—it is one of a\nconsciousness “foreign to” the American consciousness\nnative to the population of “this country.” This\nforeign-ness creates the “actual separation” that throws\nblacks “upon ourselves.” It is not a contest between equal\nand opposite forces, but a kind of resultant force produced by a\nstronger active force and a weaker passive force.  Crummell's is thus\na sort of Hegelian stand-off: a conflict between blacks and the needs\nand “interests” and social advantages they seek, a contest\nset up by their natural form. \n\nDu Bois and Hegel both saw the effort to be a self-conscious free\nindividual as something that was enacted in historical time. Hegel, for\ninstance, took masters and slaves to coordinate each other's\nachievement of self-consciousness, each seeing themselves in terms of\nwhat the other is capable of doing. Du Bois identifies a similar\ncoordination between the “inner selves” of blacks, one African, the\nother American, both native and alien at the same time. Crummell sees\nblacks opposing themselves in a conflict that cannot be opted out of,\nsince it is a constitutive part of the struggle for self-awareness that\nevery people goes through. He thus moves the focus from where a casual\nobserver might look—the action between blacks and whites, slaves and\nmasters—to an internal struggle—between blacks and their own\nconflicted nature. \nAs a consequence on this state of things, all the stimulants of\nambition and self-love should lead this people to united effort for\npersonal superiority and the uplifting of the race; but, instead\nthereof, overshadowed by a more powerful race of people; wanting\nin the cohesion which comes from racial enthusiasm; lacking in the\nconfidence which is the root of a people's stability; disintegration,\ndoubt, and distrust almost universally prevail, and distract all their\nbusiness and policies. (“Social Principle,” 32) \n\nIt is easy to discern the main threads of Crummell's influence on Du\nBois' later thought. \n\nCrummell remains encouraged about African enlightenment through all\nof this, though. Principles of Mutuality and\nDependence follow from the Social Principle, facilitating\nmoral change. The Principle of Mutuality determines those\n“reciprocal tendencies and desires which interact between large bodies\nof men, aiming at single and definite ends,” while the Principle\nof Dependence has “[n]o man stand[ing] up entirely alone,\nself-sufficient in the entire circle of human needs” (“Social Principle,” 33). He observes\nthat “it has taken ten centuries to change [the Englishman] from the\nrudeness of his brutalized forefathers into an enlightened and\ncivilized human being” (34); so too, he thought, for African moral\nchange. \n\nIt thus becomes easier to discern Crummell's larger view about how a\npeople can impact the course of history. The active Mental and Moral\nPrinciples of reason start a cycle, causing a people so stirred to\nsatisfy conditions of intellectual and moral enlightenment. Once they\nare enlightened, reason itself—considered as an abstract, global\nresource, the main active force in history—increases in its civilizing\npotential. Thus the history of reason moves forward as a vital, active\nprinciple, completing a feedback loop. For blacks to affect history,\nthey must become civilized, and propagate civilizing reason to push\nhistory forward. (As I describe above, this process is part of each\ngeneration's obligations to posterity within the course of history.)\nFortunately the Social Principle and its corollaries optimize the\nchances of that happening. \n\nBut for the cycle to get its start, the “native” must be\ntrusted with the possibility of civilization—in Matthew Arnold's\nphrase (quoted approvingly by Crummell), the “possibility of\nright.” Until they achieve that state, they are to be treated\nwith the necessity of tutelage, the “necessity of force and\nauthority.” “Mere theories of democracy” cannot be\napplied to “a rude people, incapable of perceiving their own\nplace in the moral scale, nor of understanding the social and\npolitical obligations” of civilized peoples (“Our National\nMistakes” [AA], 185). “Force and right,”\nCrummell writes, quoting Arnold, “are the governors of this\nworld; force till right is ready….And till right is\nready, force, the existing order of things, is justified, is the\nlegitimate rule.” He agrees with Arnold that right\n“implies inward recognition” that we must be capable of\nboth “seeing” and “willing.” Until that is\nattained, until the “native” outgrows their\n“childhood,” the enlightened have the\n“responsibility of guardianship over them.” \n\nThis awkward paternalism is difficult for the contemporary reader to\naccept. It must be read, though, in the context of the respect he has\nfor the native intelligence in all groups, his fellow blacks included.\nAgreeing with Mill's caution that force over the native should be that\nwhich fits them to become a nation Crummell insists that force should\nbe the force of restoration and progress (“Our National Mistakes,” 185n). In the “native\nman's moral constitution” is a “great felt need, and a\ngreat object of desire [for] peace, order, and protection”; and\nthey are motivated by an acquisitive principle, “the impelling\nmotive power in all [their] endurance and weariness” (191). He\nunderstood that there simply was no project without a native African\ncapacity for civilization.","contact.mail":"ThompsonS@wpunj.edu","contact.domain":"wpunj.edu"}]
