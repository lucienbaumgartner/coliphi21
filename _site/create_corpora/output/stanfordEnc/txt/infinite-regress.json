Usually such\narguments take the form of objections to a theory, with the fact that\nthe theory implies an infinite regress being taken to be\nobjectionable.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways in which a theory’s resulting in an infinite\nregress can form an objection to that theory. The regress might reveal\na bad feature of the theory—a feature that is not the regress\nitself, that we have independent reason to think is a reason to reject\nthe theory. Or the fact that the theory results in the infinite\nregress might itself be taken to be a reason to reject the theory. The\nformer cases are the easier ones, since in those cases we do not have\nto make a judgment as to whether the regress itself is objectionable,\nwe only need to ask about the feature of the theory that the regress\nreveals. We will look at cases like this first, before turning to\ncases where the regress itself might be seen as a reason to reject a\ntheory.\n\n\n\nMany, many infinite regress arguments have been given throughout the\nhistory of philosophy, and we will not attempt here to survey even the\nmost important of them. Rather, the aim will be to shed light on the\nkinds of regress argument that may be encountered, and the different\nconsiderations that arise in different cases. As we proceed, however,\nwe will see some particularly famous regress arguments as\n examples. (Rescher 2010 and Wieland 2014 survey some historical\n regresses.)[2]\n\n\nSometimes it is uncontroversial that a theory that generates an\ninfinite regress is objectionable, because the regress reveals that\nthe theory suffers from some kind of theoretical vice that is a reason\nto reject the theory independently of it yielding an infinite\nregress. In these cases, an infinite regress argument can show us that\nwe have reason to reject a theory, but it is not because the theory\nyields a regress per se, but rather because it has this other\nbad feature, and the regress has revealed that. \n\nOne such kind of case is when the very same principles of a theory\nthat generate the regress also lead to a contradiction. If this is so\nthen it does not matter what we think about infinite regress in\ngeneral, we will of course have reason to reject the theory, because\nit is contradictory. Two such examples are discussed by Daniel Nolan\n(2001), and we will recount one of them here (also cf. Clark\n1988). The theory in question is Plato’s theory of Forms, and\nthe regress objection is Parmenides’s Third Man objection, as\nreconstructed by Vlastos (1954). \n\nSuppose some things, the \\(X\\)s, are alike in a certain way: they\nshare some feature, \\(F\\). The theory of Forms says that if this is so\nthen there is some form, \\(F\\)-ness, in which the \\(X\\)s each\nparticipate and in virtue of which they have that shared feature. The\ntheory of Forms also says that Forms are self-predicated: the Form of\nthe good is good, the Form of largeness is large, etc. So the Form of\n\\(F\\)-ness is \\(F\\). In that respect, then, it is like each of the\n\\(X\\)s. So not only are the \\(X\\)s all alike in a certain way, the\n\\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness are all alike in a certain way. And so there\nmust be some Form in which each of the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness\nparticipate, in virtue of which they have this shared\nfeature. However, this Form cannot be \\(F\\)-ness, because the Form\nmust be distinct from the things that have that character that\nparticipate in it, so the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness must participate in a\nnew form \\(F_1\\)-ness. But \\(F_1\\)-ness will, just like the \\(X\\)s and\n\\(F\\)-ness, be \\(F_1\\), given that Forms self-predicate, and so the\n\\(X\\)s, \\(F\\)-ness and \\(F_1\\)-ness are all alike in a certain way\n… and so on. We are off on an infinite regress. \n\nWhatever one thinks about regresses in general, the principles that\ngenerate this regress must be denied, for they lead to\ncontradiction. The theory of Forms, as presented here at least, tells\nus (i) that when some things are a certain way, they participate in a\nsingle Form, in virtue of which they are that way; (ii) that Forms\nself-predicate—Forms themselves are the way that things that\nparticipate in them are; and (iii) that the Form is distinct from the\nthings that participate in it. Each of these three claims is essential\nto generating the regress: without (i) we don’t get the\nexistence of a Form in the first place, without (ii) we don’t\nget the second list of things with a shared feature, so would stop\nsimply with the \\(X\\)s participating in some Form, and without (iii)\nwe could conclude that just as the \\(X\\)s participate in \\(F\\)-ness,\nso do the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness itself—there would be no need for a\nnew Form. So (i)–(iii) generate a regress, and they are each\nneeded to do so.  But (i)–(iii) are inconsistent, and no regress\nargument is needed to show that. (i) and (ii) together entail that\nForms participate in themselves. (ii) tells us that \\(F\\)-ness is\n\\(F\\), and (i) tells us that if this is so it is in virtue of\n\\(F\\)-ness participating in \\(F\\)-ness, since that is how in\ngeneral things get to be \\(F\\). So \\(F\\)-ness participates in\nitself, and so by (iii) \\(F\\)-ness must be distinct from itself, since\nForms are distinct from that which participates in them. But nothing\nis distinct from itself: contradiction. \n\nWe don’t need an argument against infinite regresses to show\nthat this version of the theory of Forms is no good: that it is\ncontradictory is the best reason we could have to reject it. Now,\nthat the theory is contradictory and that it leads to an intuitively\nworrying infinite regress are not unrelated. Beyond the mere\nontological profligacy involved in being committed to infinitely many\nForms any time we notice that some things are some way (we will come\nback to ontological profligacy and regress in section 4), what seems\nintuitively problematic about the regress of Forms is that we\nshouldn’t get a new Form each time. The \\(X\\)s are\n\\(F\\), so we have the form of \\(F\\)-ness in which they participate. We\nthen get a new Form in which the \\(X\\)s and \\(F\\)-ness all\nparticipate. But why do we have a new Form? We don’t have a new\nshared feature, we have the very same shared feature we started with:\njust as the \\(X\\)s are all \\(F\\), so is \\(F\\)-ness itself. We\nalready have the Form that makes something \\(F\\):\n\\(F\\)-ness. The regress is troubling because we shouldn’t be\ninvoking a new Form, but we have to because of the ban on Forms\nparticipating in themselves. But this diagnosis of why the regress is\ntroubling is really just another way of stating the contradiction at\nthe heart of the theory: the Form \\(F\\)-ness is supposed to be in\ngeneral the thing in virtue of which things get to be \\(F\\), but\nit also cannot be because it itself must be \\(F\\) and it cannot\nparticipate in itself. So the regress and the contradiction are\nintimately related. As Nolan (2001, 528) puts it: “infinite\nregresses of this sort and the statement of formal contradiction are\ndifferent ways of bringing out [the same] unacceptable\nfeature.” \n\nThis is an easy case, because we don’t have to adjudicate on\nwhether the fact that the theory leads to an infinite regress is itself\nobjectionable. The principles that lead to regress also lead to\ncontradiction, and we know that a theory’s being contradictory is\na good reason to reject it, whether it leads to regress or not. \n\nMore generally, if the features of a theory that result in an\ninfinite regress also result in some theoretical vice that we know to\nbe objectionable independently of whether or not there is a\nregress, then we have a reason to reject that theory that doesn’t\ndepend on the theory leading to regress. Sometimes, the\ntheoretical vice in question will be a global one: a feature that is a\nreason to reject any theory that has it. Yielding a contradiction\n is, relatively\n uncontroversially[3],\n such a vice. Other\ntimes, the feature in question might be a local vice: a feature that\nmight be an unobjectionable feature of certain theories, but a reason\nto reject a particular theory \\(T\\) because of the particular theoretical\nambitions of \\(T\\) or as a result of other things we know about \\(T\\)’s\nsubject matter. \n\nFor example, a theory might result in an infinite regress of entities\nand, as a result, entail that there are infinitely many things. This\nin itself is, arguably, not objectionable. But it might be a local\nvice to a theory if we have independent reason to think that we are\ndealing with a finite domain. (See Nolan 2001, 531–532.) (Some\nphilosophers object to the very idea of reality containing\ninfinities. Aristotle, e.g., famously allowed that there could\nbe potential infinite series, but not\ncompleted infinite series. (See Mendel 2017.)) But we will\nignore such general anti-infinitism in this entry, for it is infinity\nitself that such theorists take to be objectionable, not\ninfinite regresses per se.) \n\nPeano’s axioms for arithmetic, e.g., yield an infinite\nregress. We are told that zero is a natural number, that every natural\nnumber has a natural number as a successor, that zero is not the\nsuccessor of any natural number, and that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nnatural numbers with the same successor, then \\(x = y\\). This yields\nan infinite regress. Zero has a successor. It cannot be zero, since\nzero is not any natural number’s successor, so it must be a new\nnatural number: one. One must have a successor. It cannot be zero, as\nbefore, nor can it be one itself, since then zero and one would have\nthe same successor and hence be identical, and we have already said\nthey must be distinct. So there must be a new natural number that is\nthe successor of one: two. Two must have a successor: three. And so on\n… And this infinite regress entails that there are infinitely\nmany things of a certain kind: natural numbers. But few have found\nthis worrying.  After all, there is no independent reason to think\nthat the domain of natural numbers is finite—quite the\nopposite. \n\nBy contrast, consider the following two principles: (i) Every event is\npreceded by another event that is its cause; (ii) The relation\n\\(x\\) precedes \\(y\\) is irreflexive (nothing precedes\nitself), asymmetric (if \\(a\\) precedes \\(b\\) then \\(b\\) does not\nprecede \\(a\\)) and transitive (if \\(a\\) precedes \\(b\\) and \\(b\\)\nprecedes \\(c\\) then \\(a\\) precedes \\(c\\)). \n\nThis yields an infinite regress, at least from the assumption that\nthere is at least one event. If there is an event, \\(E_1\\), then it is\npreceded by its cause. That cause cannot be \\(E_1\\), as nothing\nprecedes itself and causes precede what they cause. So the cause of\n\\(E_1\\) must be a new event, \\(E_2\\). This event is preceded by its\ncause. This cannot be \\(E_2\\) for the same reasons as before, and it\ncannot be \\(E_1\\) because then each of \\(E_1\\) and \\(E_2\\) would\nprecede the other in violation of asymmetry. So the cause of \\(E_2\\)\nmust be a new event, \\(E_3\\). \\(E_3\\) is preceded by its cause. It\ncannot be \\(E_3\\) or \\(E_2\\) for reasons similar to before. And it\ncannot be \\(E_1\\), for then \\(E_1\\) would precede \\(E_3\\), but since\n\\(E_3\\) precedes \\(E_2\\) which precedes \\(E_1\\), transitivity entails\nthat \\(E_3\\) precedes \\(E_1\\), and so \\(E_1\\) cannot precede \\(E_3\\) due to\nasymmetry. So the cause of \\(E_3\\) must be a new event, \\(E_4\\). And\nso on … \n\nThis regress of events is very similar to the regress of natural\nnumbers. In each case we start from the claim that there is a thing of\na certain kind (a number or an event), and we have a principle that\ntells us that for each thing of that kind, there is another thing of\nthat very kind that bears a certain relation to the previous one (it\nis its successor, or it is its preceding cause).  We then have\nsupplementary principles that rule out the other thing of that kind\nbeing any of the things on our list so far, thus forcing us to\nintroduce a new thing of that kind, thus inviting the application of\nthe principles to this new thing, and so on ad infinitum. But\nwhile the regress and resulting infinity of natural numbers is\narguably unobjectionable, the regress of events seems problematic,\nbecause we have good empirical reasons to deny that there are\ninfinitely many events, each preceded by another. For either that\ninfinite sequence of events takes place in a finite amount of time or\nan infinite one. We have good empirical reason to rule out the latter\noption, since we have good empirical reason to think that there has\nonly been a finite amount of past time: that time started a finite\ntime ago with the Big Bang. And we have good empirical reason to rule out\nthe former option, since the only way of fitting an infinite series of\nevents, each preceded by another, into a finite stretch of time is by\nhaving the time between them become arbitrarily small. So for example,\n\\(A_2\\) might be a minute before \\(A_1\\), and \\(A_3\\) half a minute\nbefore \\(A_2\\), and \\(A_4\\) a quarter of a minute before \\(A_3\\),\netc. If the time between events \\(A_n\\) and \\(A_{n + 1}\\) is always\nhalf the time between events \\(A_{n - 1}\\) and \\(A_n\\), we can fit\ninfinitely many events into a two minute time-period. But this\nrequires the time between events to become arbitrarily small, and\nthere is some reason to think that time is quantized, such that there\nis a minimum length of time during which a change can occur, thus\nproviding a lower limit on the amount of time that can separate two\ntemporally distant events.  (See Nolan 2008b for relevant discussion\nand further references.) \n\nSo while the numbers regress and the events regress are structurally\nanalogous, we might find the principles that yield the regress\nobjectionable in one case but not the other, because while each\nregress entails that there are infinitely many things of kind \\(K\\),\nwhether that is a vice may depend on what kind \\(K\\) is, and whether\nwe have independent reason to think that the domain of \\(K\\)s is a\nfinite one. Yielding infinitely many things of kind \\(K\\) might be a\nlocal vice when the kind in question is events separated in time, but\nnot when the kind in question is natural numbers structured by the\nsuccessor relation. \n\nIn the previous section we saw two theories generating similar\nregresses, but where one is found unobjectionable whereas the other is\nfound objectionable due to the different things we think we know,\nindependently of encountering these regress arguments, about the\nsubject matter of the theories. We could also have cases where a\nsingle theory yields a regress that is objectionable by the lights of\none theorist and not another, as a result of their differing\ntheoretical commitments leading one but not the other to think that a\nfeature revealed by the regress is a vice. \n\nConsider Bradley’s regress. (Bradley 1893 [1968], (21–29).  Note,\nhowever, that Bradley is very hard to interpret, and there is much\ndebate concerning how to reconstruct his argument. See the entry on \nBradley’s regress\nfor discussion.) We start with the demand to give an account of\npredication: what is it for \\(A\\) to be \\(F\\)? One answer is that it\nis for the particular \\(A\\) to be bound to the property of\n\\(F\\)-ness. But this answer yields a new predication: \\(A\\) is bound\nto \\(F\\)-ness. If the original monadic predication of \\(A\\) demands an\naccount, this relational predication of \\(A\\) and \\(F\\)-ness also\ndemands an account. Since before we posited a property corresponding\nto the monadic predicate and said that the property was bound to the\nobject that was the subject of predication, we should follow suit here\nand posit a relation corresponding to the dyadic predicate and say\nthat it is bound to the two things that are the subjects of that\npredication. So we should posit a relation—let’s call it\ninstantiation—that binds together \\(A\\) and\n\\(F\\)-ness. But this yields another new predication: Instantiation\nbinds \\(A\\) to \\(F\\)-ness. Now this triadic predication needs to be\naccounted for, and so we need a relation corresponding to the triadic\npredicate—let’s call it the instantiation\\(_2\\)\nrelation—that binds together the instantiation relation, \\(A\\),\nand \\(F\\)-ness. But this yields yet another predication, this time a\ntetradic one: Instantiation\\(_2\\) binds Instantiation to \\(A\\) and\n\\(F\\)-ness… And so on. Each predicational fact tells us that\nsome particulars, properties, and relations are bound together, which\nforces us to posit a relation corresponding to that binding, which\ngenerates the next predicational fact, and so on ad\ninfinitum. \n\nIs this regress objectionable? Arguably it depends on what we want\nfrom an account of predication. If what you want is an\nanalysis of predication, then arguably this regress\nis objectionable. If you start off not understanding\npredication—if you find it just utterly mysterious what\n‘\\(A\\) is \\(F\\)’ is meant to mean, given that this\n‘is’ is not identity—then this regress means that\nthis account is not going to help you, for each answer simply invokes\nanother predication, which is exactly what you don’t\nunderstand. If you don’t understand ‘\\(A\\) is\n\\(F\\)’, you’re not going to understand ‘\\(A\\) is\nbound to \\(F\\)-ness’, or ‘Instantiation is bound to \\(A\\)\nand \\(F\\)-ness’, or etc., since the ‘is’ in those\nclaims is also not the ‘is’ of identity but the\n‘is’ of predication, which you find a mystery.  However,\nif you understand predication perfectly fine and want simply\nan ontological account of it—an account of what in the\nworld makes true the true predications—then arguably\nthe regress is not objectionable, because while there are\ninfinitely many true predications, these can all be made true by the\none underlying state of the world: the state of affairs of the\nparticular \\(A\\) being bound to the property \\(F\\)-ness. Just as this\nstate of affairs makes it true that \\(A\\) is \\(F\\), so does it make it\ntrue that \\(A\\) is bound to \\(F\\)-ness, and that this binding holds\nbetween \\(A\\) and \\(F\\)-ness, and etc. We would have one ontological\nunderpinning for the infinitely many true predications. As Nolan\n(2008a, 182) puts it, we have “Ontology for each truth, and no\ninfinite regress of [states of affairs], but only of descriptions of\n[states of affairs]: and it should never be thought that an infinite\nregress of descriptions is something to worry about per\nse”. (Cf.  Armstrong 1974 and 1997 (157–8).) So whether or\nnot we will find this regress objectionable depends on what we demand\nof an account of predication. We can all agree that the regress shows\nthat the account does not yield an analysis of predication. Is this a\ntheoretical vice? It depends on whether or not predication requires an\nanalysis, and that depends on our theoretical goals. \n\nAnother regress that arguably fits this pattern is McTaggart’s\n(1908) regress argument against the reality of the A-series of\ntime. The A-series of time is the sequence of times one of which is\npresent, others past, and others future. (As opposed to the B-series,\nwhich merely says that some times are before others, some after\nothers, etc., without singling out any as being past, present, or\nfuture.) But, says McTaggart, the times that are past,\nwere present; the time that is present was future and\nwill be past; the times that are future will be\npresent and will be past. McTaggart concludes that we\nend up attributing each A-property (is present, is past, and\nis future) to every time (and therefore to every event in\ntime). But this is absurd, because the A-properties are\nincompatible: to have one is to have neither of the others. So we\nend up in contradiction: each time both has only one such property, and\nall such properties. McTaggart concludes that the A-series cannot\nbe real. \n\nAn obvious response to McTaggart’s argument is this:\nit’s not that some future time is present and past as\nwell, it’s merely that it will be present and will\nbe (later still) past. That is: no time and event\nhas more than one of the A-properties, it is merely the case\nthat they have one A-property and did and will have\nanother. But McTaggart thinks this response does not solve the\nproblem, because it leads to regress. He says (ibid., 469): \n\nIf we avoid the incompatibility of the three characteristics by\nasserting that M is present, has been future, and will be past, we are\nconstructing a second A series, within which the first falls, in the\nsame way in which events fall within the first… the second A\nseries will suffer from the same difficulty as the first, which can\nonly be removed by placing it inside a third A series. The same\nprinciple will place the third inside a fourth, and so on without\nend. You can never get rid of the contradiction, for, by the act of\nremoving it from what is to be explained, you produce it over again in\nthe explanation. And so the explanation is invalid. \n\nMcTaggart’s argument is difficult and philosophers disagree on\nhow to interpret it, but here is one interpretation. (See Dummett 1960\nand Mellor 1998 (72–74) for two among many presentations of the\nargument along similar lines. See Cameron 2015 (Ch. 2) and Skow 2015\n(Ch. 6) for recent discussion.) \n\nThe way things were and the way things will be seems to be part of\nreality in a way that, for example, Bilbo’s finding the One Ring\nis not, it’s merely part of a fiction. History is\nnot a fiction, it’s part of our world, so historical\ntruths and future truths should, seemingly, be part of the overall\naccount of how the world is. But that is puzzling, given that\nthings change and, hence, the way things were is incompatible\nwith the way things are now. How can they both contribute to the way\nreality is if they are incompatible?  McTaggart’s\nargument focuses on a particular instance of this concerning the\nA-properties. Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon is past. But\nit was present, and so its presentness is a feature of our\nworld’s history. But our world’s history, as we just said,\nis part of the complete account of how our world is, and so\nthe complete account of how our world is includes both Caesar’s\ncrossing the Rubicon being past and it being present, and yet those\nare incompatible features. The defender of the A-series replies by\ninsisting that in giving the complete account of how reality is we\nhave to take seriously the fact that reality changes and that\nit is, therefore, different ways\nsuccessively, and there is no inconsistency in things being\none way and then another, incompatible, way. So\nit’s not that reality is such that Caesar’s crossing the\nRubicon is both past and present, it’s that reality is such that\nCaesar’s crossing the Rubicon was future, and\nwas present, and is now past. \n\nMcTaggart responds by restating this response in terms of\nsecond-order A-properties. To say that Caesar’s crossing\nthe Rubicon was future, and was present, and is\nnow past is to say that it has the properties of being\npast future (i.e. having been future), past present\n(i.e. having been present) and present past (i.e. now being\npast). And similar reasoning to the above suggests that every\ntime and event has each of the nine possible second-order A-properties;\nand while it’s not the case that any two of them are\nincompatible, certain pairs of them are. Nothing can be both\npast past and future future, for example: if \\(E\\)\nhas been a mere past event, it can’t be true that \\(E\\) will be\nsomething that is yet to happen. And yet the complete account of\nreality seems to include both Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon\nbeing past past and its being future future. After all, in 2000 BCE\nCaesar’s crossing the Rubicon was future future, since 1000 BCE\nwas the future and Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon would still be\nthe future then. And Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon is past past\njust now, since 1000 CE is past, and Caesar’s crossing the\nRubicon was past then. But both 2000 BCE and the present are part of\nthe overall history of the world, so the goings on at each time are\npart of what the world as a whole is like, and so Caesar’s\ncrossing the Rubicon is both past past and future future, and yet\nthose are incompatible. And again, the defender of the A-series will\nrespond that it’s not that Caesar’s crossing the Rubicon\nis both past past and future future, it’s that it is\nnow past past and was future future. And\nMcTaggart will respond that this is to invoke third-order\nA-properties—being present past past, being past future\nfuture, etc. And the same problem will arise, and invite the\nsame response, which will lead to the same problem concerning\nfourth-order A-properties, which will invite the same response again\n… and so on, ad infinitum. \n\nWhether McTaggart’s regress is vicious has proven a subject of\nmuch debate. Some philosophers see the regress as demonstrating that\nany attempt to describe the world in A-theoretic terms is ultimately\ninconsistent, and see the A-theorist as merely invoking another\ninconsistent account of reality every time they attempt to explain\naway this inconsistency. Mellor, for example, says (1998, 75)\n“[McTaggart’s] critics react by denying the viciousness of\nthe regress. At every stage, they say, we can remove the apparent\ncontradiction by distinguishing the times at which the events have\nincompatible [A-properties]. They ignore the fact that the way they\ndistinguish these times … only generates more\ncontradictions.” Others see McTaggart as simply making a\nconfused challenge at each stage—as mistakenly concluding from\nthe fact that things were one way and are now\nanother incompatible way that they are both ways at\nonce—and continuing to make the same mistake in response to each\nof the A-theorist’s correct explanations that in fact the\nincompatible properties are only ever had one after another, never at\nthe same time. Skow (2015, 87), e.g., says “At each stage\n[McTaggart] accuses objective becoming [i.e. things changing their\nA-properties] of being inconsistent, and [the A-theorist] shows that\nallegation to be false. And even an infinite sequence of false\nallegations does not add up to a good argument.” \n\nThis is arguably another case where whether or not the regress is\nvicious by a philosopher’s lights will depend on their\nbackground theoretical commitments. If one starts out happy with the\nnotion of succession—i.e. of one thing being the case\nand\nthen ceasing to be the case as something else comes to\nbe the case—then one may be inclined to see McTaggart’s\nregress as entirely benign. We start out with a set of\nincompatible properties that are never had by anything simultaneously\nbut are held by things successively; in stating that those properties\nare had successively we make salient a new set of incompatible\nproperties, but these are also never had by anything simultaneously,\nonly successively; this makes salient yet another set of incompatible\nproperties, and so on ad infinitum. There is never, at\nany stage, a contradiction, if the notion of succession is indeed in\ngood standing, for we are never forced to say that a thing has\nincompatible properties, only that a thing successively has properties\nthat cannot be had simultaneously. If, by contrast, one is\nsuspicious of the very notion of succession—if one sees in\nit simply an attempt to paper over what is ultimately a contradiction\ninherent in the commitment to reality being each of two incompatible\nways, the way it supposedly is now and the way it supposedly was or\nwill be—then one will see in McTaggart’s regress an\ninfinite sequence of contradictory accounts of how reality is, with\neach attempt at explaining away the contradiction simply resulting in\nanother such contradictory account. The regress, then, looks\nvicious or benign depending on whether one is content to grant the\nlegitimacy of the notion of temporal succession. \n\nIn section 1 we looked at cases where an infinite regress is taken to\nreveal some feature that might, possibly depending on your other\ntheoretical commitments, be taken to reveal a feature of a theory\nindependent of its leading to regress that is a reason to\nreject it. But sometimes the regress itself is taken to be an\nobjectionable feature of the theory that yields it. \n\nSuppose that there is an \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\), and that to account for\nwhy \\(X\\) is \\(F\\) we need to appeal to another \\(X\\) that is\nalso \\(F\\). Now there is the question as to why this \\(X\\) is\n\\(F\\), and so we need to appeal to another \\(X\\) which\nis also \\(F\\) …. If this proceeds ad\ninfinitum, with a new \\(X\\) invoked at each new stage in the\nprocess, there is a concern that we end up without having accounted\nfor the \\(F\\)-ness of any of the \\(X\\)s.  If this infinite regress\nargument is successful then our choices are either: \n\nFoundationalism: To halt the regress by taking there to be a\nfoundation—a set of \\(X\\)s whose \\(F\\)-ness is taken to\nbe basic, and by which we can account for the \\(F\\)-ness of all other\n\\(X\\)s. \n\nor: \n\nCoherentism: To resist an infinite regress by allowing a circular or\nholistic explanation of the \\(F\\)-ness of at least some \\(X\\)s. \n\nInfinite regress arguments used to motivate Foundationalism or\nCoherentism appear in many different areas of philosophy. Here\nare some highlights: In metaphysics: \n\nMetaphysicians have wanted to account for the very existence, or\nnature, of some things by appealing to things on which they\nontologically depend: for example, a complex object exists and is the\nway it is because its parts exist and are the way they are; a set\nexists because its members exist; etc. (See Fine 1995 and Koslicki\n2013 for discussion.) But of course the things the dependent beings\ndepend on must themselves exist as well. Some have been suspicious of\nthe idea that this can go on ad infinitum, with every thing\nbeing ontologically dependent on some new thing(s), and thus have\nargued for Metaphysical Foundationalism: the view that there is a\n collection of absolutely\n fundamental[4]\n entities upon which all else ultimately\nontologically depends. Aquinas, e.g., holds that events are\nontologically dependent on their causes, and that an infinite regress\nof causes and effects would be an infinite series of things each of\n which is ontologically dependent on the next, and this is\n impossible.[5]\n Thus he concludes that there must be a first cause of all else that is\nitself uncaused—namely, God. We shall see more examples of\n Metaphysical Foundationalists below. See also the supplementary document on \n Metaphysical Foundationalism and the Well-Foundedness of Ontological Dependence.\n \n\n(Metaphysical Coherentism—the view that ontological dependence\ncould be a holistic phenomenon—has received few defenders, but\nsee Barnes 2018, Nolan 2018, Priest 2014 (Chs. 11 & 12) for some\ndiscussion.) In epistemology: \n\nEpistemologists want to account for the justification of our\nbeliefs. We do not want to believe at random, we want our beliefs to\nbe justified—that is, we want there to be a\nreason to believe the propositions we believe. But those\nreasons will be further propositions, and if our initial belief is to\nbe justified, so surely must the reasons for that belief be, and so we\nmust appeal to yet more propositions, and so on. Many—going back\nto Sextus Empiricus (Outlines of Pyrrhonism PH I,\n164–9)—have thought that this cannot proceed ad\ninfinitum, and that the only serious options are Epistemic\nFoundationalism—the view that there is a class of propositions\nwhose justification does not come via some other justified\npropositions, and that can provide a reason for everything else we\nbelieve—or Epistemic Coherentism—the view that a\ncollection of propositions can collectively be justified in virtue of\nthe web of epistemic relations they stand in to one another. Thus Sosa\n(1980, 3) says “epistemology must choose between the solid\nsecurity of the ancient foundationalist pyramid and the risky\nadventure of the new coherentist raft.” (See the entries on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification\nand\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification\nfor surveys of Epistemic Foundationalism and Epistemic Coherentism, respectively). In ethics: \n\nAs well as asking about the source of justification for our moral\nbeliefs (see e.g., Sinnott-Armstrong 1996), moral philosophers have\nbeen concerned with distinctively moral regresses, which arise not\nwhen we attempt to account for the justification of a moral claim, but\nrather when we attempt to account for the moral status of something by\nappealing to something else of the same moral status, and so on.\nAristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, 1094a) thought that some things were\ngood because we desire them for the sake of something else that is\ngood. But if everything that is good is good simply because\nit aims at something else that is good, this would lead to a regress\nand “all desire would be futile and vain”.  And so\nAristotle argues that there must be a Highest Good—something\nthat is desired for its own sake—that other things can be good\nin virtue of aiming towards this highest good. Aristotle is a Moral\nFoundationalist: there is something whose goodness does not get\nexplained by reference to anything else, by means of which the\ngoodness of other things is accounted for. \n\n(Explicit statements of anything other than Foundationalism in the\n moral case are hard to come\n by.[6] \n But see Roberts 2017 for relevant discussion.) \n\nHowever it is also always possible to simply embrace the regress and\naccept: \n\nInfinitism: The \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) is accounted for by facts\ninvolving a new \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\), and this proceeds ad\ninfinitum. \n\nWhether in metaphysics, epistemology, or ethics, Foundationalism has\noften been seen as the default, orthodox, view, with Coherentism being\nseen as the radical alternative. Infinitism is often simply dismissed,\nor not even considered as a live option.  Foundationalism and\n Coherentism are\n (often[7])\n motivated by the thought that if the \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) is\naccounted for by appeal to a new \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\) then each of\nthose infinitely many explanations fails. The thought is that each\nexplanation of the \\(F\\)-ness of an \\(X\\) would be dependent on the\nsuccess of the next, a promissory note that is never paid if that\nprocess does not end. Let’s examine this anti-Infinitist\nthought. \n\nTo focus our inquiry, consider the case of a complex object and its\nproper parts. Some metaphysicians have considered the possibility that\nthere are gunky objects: objects such that every part of them\nitself has proper parts. If \\(A\\) is gunky then it is composed of some\nthings, the \\(X\\)s, such that there is more than one of the \\(X\\)s,\nand \\(A\\) is not amongst the \\(X\\)s. Pick one of those \\(X\\)s,\n\\(X_1\\). \\(X_1\\) is composed of some things, the \\(Y\\)s, such that\nthere is more than one of the \\(Y\\)s, and neither \\(A\\) nor \\(X_1\\) is\n amongst the\n \\(Y\\)s.[8] \n Pick one of those \\(Y\\)s, \\(Y_1\\). \\(Y_1\\) is composed of some things,\nthe \\(Z\\)s, such that there is more than one of the \\(Z\\)s, and\nneither \\(A\\), nor \\(X_1\\), nor \\(Y_1\\) is amongst the \\(Z\\)s. And so\non. This process will never end: each item in the series is a\ncollection of entities (a collection containing just one thing in the\nfirst case, and more than one thing in every subsequent case), and\ngiven the transitivity of parthood each thing in each collection will\nbe a part of \\(A\\) and hence—since \\(A\\) is ex\nhypothesi gunky—will itself be composed of a collection of\nproper parts, and so we can therefore pick any member from any\ncollection to generate the next item on the list. (Of course, a thing\nneed not—and if it is gunky, will not—have a\nunique decomposition: there can be two collections of things, the\n\\(X\\)s and the \\(Y\\)s, each of which compose \\(A\\), where none of the\n\\(X\\)s is amongst the \\(Y\\)s and vice versa. But all we need is that\nthere are some such collections, from which we can pick\narbitrarily to get the next collection in the sequence.) Now take the\ninfinite series that consists of \\(A\\) as its first element, \\(X_1\\)\nas its second element, \\(Y_1\\) as its third, etc. So we form this\ninfinite sequence by taking one item from each collection that formed\nthe previous infinite sequence: namely that item which was used to\ngive us the collection of things that came next in the series. \n\nAssuming that complex objects are ontologically dependent on their\nproper parts, we now have an infinite regress of entities, each of\nwhich is ontologically dependent on the next. Such an infinite regress\nhas been thought by some metaphysicians to be objectionable, leading\nthem to reject the possibility of gunk. Leibniz, for example, argues\nthat there cannot be only “beings by aggregation” (i.e.,\ncomposite objects), because this would lead to an infinite regress,\nwith each being by aggregation being made up of further beings by\naggregation, and so on ad infinitum. \n\nLeibniz’s idea seems to be that if each thing depends on some\nother, there could not be anything at all in the first place. The\nthought is that ontologically dependent entities inherit their\nexistence, or being, from that on which they depend; so if this chain\nof dependence does not terminate, the whole process couldn’t get\noff the ground, and there would be nothing at all. Leibniz says\n(1686–87, 85): \n\nWhere there are only beings by aggregation [composite objects], there\nare no real beings. For every being by aggregation presupposes beings\nendowed with real unity [simples], because every being derives its\nreality only from the reality of those beings of which it is composed,\nso that it will not have any reality at all if each being of which it\nis composed is itself a being by aggregation, a being for which we\nmust still seek further grounds for its reality, grounds which can\nnever be found in this way, if we must always continue to seek for\nthem. \n\nBy contrast, if the dependence runs in the other direction—if we\nstart off with a fundamental entity whose being can then ground the\nbeing of each subsequent entity—there is arguably no problem if that\nprocess continues ad infinitum: thus the infinite sequence\nwhere you start with a thing, form its singleton set, then form\nthat thing’s singleton set and so on ad\ninfinitum has not been thought to be objectionable by those who\nreject gunky objects, for it is the set that is ontologically\ndependent on its members, not vice versa. (See Fine 1994 for\ndiscussion of the direction of ontological dependence. See Cameron\n2008 and Maurin 2007 for discussion of the difference between infinite\nregresses where ontological dependence runs upwards from ones where it\nruns downwards. Cf. Clark 1988, and also Johansson 2009 and the\ndiscussion in Maurin 2013 \n\nA contemporary sympathizer with Leibniz’s thought is Jonathan\nSchaffer (2010). Unlike Leibniz, Schaffer grants the possibility of\ngunky objects, but thinks that this possibility is precisely a reason\nto deny that complex objects are (always) ontologically\ndependent on their parts.[9] \n Instead, Schaffer takes the possibility of\nthere being no simple things as a reason to hold that the dependence\nflows in the other direction: that parts are dependent on the wholes\nof which they are parts, and that every thing is thereby ontologically\ndependent on the biggest thing that there is—the\n cosmos—that has everything else as a proper\n part.[10] \n Since classical mereology guarantees that there is a biggest\nthing—the thing that has all else as proper parts—but it\ndoes not guarantee that there are any smallest things—things\nthat have no proper parts—it guarantees that if parts are\ndependent on the wholes of which they are parts then there will be a\nfirst, ontologically fundamental, element, whereas if wholes are\ndependent on their parts then there is the possibility of an infinite\nregress in which each thing is dependent on some further thing(s),\nwith nothing being fundamental: a possibility in which, Schaffer\n(2010, 62) says (agreeing with Leibniz), “Being would be\ninfinitely deferred, never achieved”. Leibniz and Schaffer\nadvocate Metaphysical Foundationalism: the view that there\nhave to be some things that are absolutely fundamental—dependent\non nothing—on which all else ultimately depends. \n\nBut is it true that if the \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) is dependent on\nthe next \\(X\\) in the sequence being \\(F\\), and if this goes on\nwithout end, that we cannot explain why any \\(X\\) is \\(F\\)? Schaffer\nclaims that in the case of an infinite regress of ontological\ndependence, with each entity depending on the next in the chain, and\nno independent entities, being would be “infinitely deferred,\nnever achieved”. Why think this? The idea seems to be that a\ndependent entity only has the being it has on condition of something\nelse having being. If \\(A\\) is ontologically dependent on \\(B\\) then\nthe existence of \\(A\\) is a promissory note, only paid if \\(B\\) itself\nexists. But if \\(B\\) is ontologically dependent on \\(C\\) then the\nexistence of \\(B\\) is a promissory note, only paid if \\(C\\) exists\n… and so on, so that if this process never stops, the\npromissory note is never paid, in which case, allegedly, the existence\nof all these things could never get off the ground in the first\nplace. \n\nAn analogy may help. Suppose Anne has no sugar, and needs some. She\ncan borrow a bag of sugar from Breanna. Now Anne has a bag of\nsugar. Where did it come from? Easy—it came from Breanna, who is\nnow a bag of sugar down. But suppose Breanna borrowed a bag of sugar\nfrom Craig in order to then pass it on to Anne. Where did Anne’s\nbag of sugar come from then?  Ultimately, from Craig, who ends up a\nbag of sugar down. But suppose Craig borrowed a bag of sugar from Devi\n… and so on,\nad infinitum. Then where did the bag of sugar come from? At\nthe end of the infinite sequence, Anne is one bag of sugar up, and\nnobody is a bag of sugar down, for everyone after Anne simply borrowed\na bag of sugar, and then passed it on to the next person in the\nchain. There’s an extra bag of sugar in the system that seems to\nhave appeared as if by magic. If there is a finite sequence of\nborrowers, however long, then the last person in the chain ends up a\nbag of sugar down, so that’s where the bag of sugar that ends up\nwith Anne ultimately comes from. But if the chain never ends, Anne\nends up with a bag of sugar that doesn’t seem to have come from\nanybody, as nobody has lost any bags of sugar—they all just\nborrowed it to pass it on. The infinite regress seems to create sugar\nfrom nowhere: pleasant, perhaps, but metaphysically suspicious all the\nsame. \n\nAs with sugar, likewise with being—or justification, or\ngoodness, or whatever feature we aim to account for. If \\(A\\) depends\non \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is fundamental, where did \\(A\\)’s being come\nfrom?  From \\(B\\). If \\(A\\) depends on \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) depends on\n\\(C\\), where did \\(A\\)’s being come from? Ultimately, from\n\\(C\\). And for any finite chain, no matter how long, we can say where\nthe being of any dependent entity ultimately comes from: from the\nfundamental thing(s) at the bottom of the chain. But if the chain is\ninfinite, the being of any thing is, arguably, as mysterious as\nAnne’s new bag of sugar. The explanation of where it came from\nis always postponed, and its presence in the system as a whole\nunexplained. So, at least, goes the regress objection. \n\nDistinguish between a local explanation of the \\(F\\)-ness of\nsome particular \\(X\\) and a global explanation of why there\nare any things that are \\(F\\) at all. Some philosophers have argued\nthat when we have an infinite regress, with the \\(F\\)-ness of each\n\\(X\\) being accounted for by appeal to another \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\),\nthen we do indeed lack a global explanation of why there are\nthings that are \\(F\\), but we nevertheless have a local explanation\nfor each of the infinitely many \\(X\\)s as to why it is\n\\(F\\). (This seems to be the position of Hume’s Cleanthes in\nPart IX of Hume 1779.) \n\nRicki Bliss, e.g., speaking of the infinite regress of ontologically\ndependent entities, says (2013, 408): “In a reality that\nadmitted of no foundations … although everything has its\nreality accounted for in terms of that upon which it depends, we have\nfailed to explain how the whole lot of them—everything—has\nany reality at all.” Compare to the infinite borrowers case: for\nany given instance of someone having received a bag of sugar, we can\nexplain where that bag of sugar came from: it came from the next\nperson in the chain. But what we can’t explain is a global fact\nabout the series as a whole: why is this bag of sugar in the series in\nthe first place? \n\nBut Bliss argues that it is not necessarily a mark against infinitely\ndescending chains of ontological dependence that it leaves this global\nfact—why does anything have being in the first\nplace?—unexplained. She says (ibid.): \n\n[T]he regress is not designed to answer this question. All the regress\ncan tell us is how each individual member has the property under\nconsideration, namely, in dependence upon something else. The\nappearance of an infinite regress should not lead us to conclude that\nnothing within the regress has the property under\nconsideration—nor has its possession of that property\nunexplained—but rather that not everything about the possession\nof the property that needs to be explained has been. \n\nContra Leibniz and Schaffer, then, Bliss rejects the idea that in an\ninfinitely descending chain of ontological dependence, being would\nnever be achieved. Having a property dependent on some\ncondition is nevertheless to have that property, so there is no\npressure, she argues, to conclude that nothing in the infinite series\nwould exist. Rather, they all exist, and the existence of each is\nperfectly well accounted for: it exists because the next thing in the\nsequence does. Everything has its being merely on some condition, but\nthe condition is always met. Why there is an infinite chain of\nexisting entities at all is not accounted for, but Bliss says it is a\nmistake to think that the regress was ever supposed to account for\nthat. \n\nBliss concludes that whether or not an ontological infinite regress\nis vicious or benign depends on what we set out to give an account\nof. If all we want is an account of why each thing exists, then\nit is benign; but if we want an account of why there are things at all,\n it is\n vicious.[11] \n She says (ibid., 414): \n\nIf \\(x\\) is grounded in \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(z\\), [and so on ad\ninfinitum] and all that we are seeking for is an explanation of\nhow or why \\(x\\) exists (as the thing that it is), an explanation of\nhow or why \\(y\\) exists, and so on ad infinitum, the regress\nis benign. Why? Because where \\(z\\) explains \\(y\\) and \\(y\\) explains\n\\(x\\) our explanans and explanandum are not\nof the same form. In order to explain facts about my existence, we can\nmake recourse to the existence of—or facts of the existence\nof—my parents, my vital organs, etc. In order to explain these\nfacts, we make recourse to further facts, and so on. At each stage, we\nhave a satisfactory explanation of that for which we are seeking one\n. . .  \n\nThe regress is not benign, however, if what we are seeking an\nexplanation for is how anything exists, or has being, at all. For even\nat infinity, what the regress shows is that we have not explained\nwhere existence comes from. Even at infinity, we are still invoking\nthings that exist in order to explain how anything exists at\nall… We encounter, at each level, the explanatory failure\ncharacteristic of a vicious infinite regress: existents whose\nexistence we seek an explanation for are explained in terms of\nexistents. The existence of \\(y\\) may explain the existence of \\(x\\)\nbut the existence of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and so on ad\ninfinitum cannot help us explain how anything exists at\nall—where being comes from. Whether or not a regress of grounds\nis vicious, therefore, will depend upon the question for which we are\nseeking an answer. \n\nSimilar remarks are made by Graham Priest (2014, 186), who asks us to\nimagine an infinite sequence of objects, \\(a_0\\), \\(a_{-1}\\),\n\\(a_{-2}\\), … etc. Each of these can be in one of two states:\nactive or passive. For each \\(n \\le 0\\), if \\(a_{n-1}\\) is passive it\ndoes nothing, but if it is active it instantaneously makes \\(a_n\\)\nactive as well; and the only way for \\(a_n\\) to become active is that\n\\(a_{n-1}\\) makes it so. Given this set-up there are only two possible\noptions: each object in the chain is active, or each is passive. But\nboth are logically possible options: the fact that each object is only\nactive if the next object makes it active (and this sequence continues\nwithout end) gives us no reason, says Priest, to reject the\npossibility of them being all active. The active status of each object\nwould be accounted for, by the active status of the previous\none. First we explain the active status of \\(a_0\\): it is explained by\nthe active status of \\(a_{-1}\\). Then we have a completely different\nthing to explain: the active status of \\(a_{-1}\\): it is explained by\nthe active status of \\(a_{-2}\\) … and so on. All such facts get\nexplained and since, Priest argues, it is a different fact being\naccounted for each time, this regress is not vicious. But echoing\nBliss, Priest admits that something is not explained. He says (ibid.,\n187) “[W]hat an infinite regress will not explain is why the\nwhole regress is as it is … the state of each \\(a_n\\) is\ndetermined by the state of \\(a_{n-1}\\), but there is nothing in this\nstory to explain why the whole system is in the all active\nstate, as opposed to the all passive state. If there is such\nan explanation, it must come from elsewhere.” \n\nSo if \\(a\\) can only exist if \\(b\\) exists for \\(a\\) to be ontologically\ndependent on, and \\(b\\) can only exist if \\(c\\) exists for \\(b\\) to be\nontologically dependent on … and so on ad infinitum,\neither the whole infinite sequence of things exists, or none of them\ndo. And if the whole infinite sequence exists, there is no\nexplanation (from within the sequence at least) as to why anything\nexists at all. However, there is an explanation for each\nparticular thing as to why it exists: it exists because the\nnext thing in the sequence does. If Bliss and Priest are correct,\nthen whether or not an ontological infinite regress is vicious or\nbenign depends on our explanatory ambitions: are we attempting to\nexplain an (infinite) collection of particular existence facts: that\nthis thing exists, that that thing exists, etc., or\nare we attempting to explain the global fact that things exist.\nExactly the same infinitely regressing ontology can be vicious or\nbenign depending on one’s theoretical lights. Notice the\nsimilarity to the discussion in section 1.3 of Bradley’s and\nMcTaggart’s regresses: once again, whether or not there is\nsomething inherently objectionable to an infinite regress may depend\non our theoretical ambitions. \n\nBliss and Priest, as we have seen, argue that while an ontological\ninfinite regress might leave some questions unanswered, there is\nnothing inherently objectionable, incoherent, or inconsistent in an\ninfinite regress of things each of which is ontologically dependent on\nthe next. However, even if such ontological infinite regresses are\npossible, some metaphysicians argue that we may have good reason to\nthink that the actual world is not like that. \n\nNolan (2001) and Cameron (2008) argue that considerations of\ntheoretical parsimony can lead us to reject ontological infinite\nregresses even if such regresses are not metaphysically impossible. A\ntheory that yields an ontological infinite regress of course thereby\nyields an infinite ontology. Even if we are not in the situation\n(discussed above in section 1.2) where we have independent knowledge\nthat we are dealing with a finite domain, this could still be a mark\nagainst the theory, simply on the grounds that it is an unparsimonious\nontology. So for example, we might object to the claim that material\nobjects are gunky—with each part of them being divisible into\nfurther proper parts—not because there’s any inconsistency\nin the hypothesis, or because it leads to an infinite chain of\nontological dependence and thereby leaves the existence of all things\nunexplained, but simply because it means that whenever there is an\nobject somewhere, there are in fact infinitely many objects there. A\ngunky world is an ontologically extravagant world, and so we have the\nsame kind of reason to reject the hypothesis that things are gunky as\nwe have to reject needlessly complex hypotheses about how things\nbehave (e.g., the Ptolemaic theory of planetary motion with its\nepicycle upon epicycle): other things being equal, we should prefer\nsimpler theories and more economical ontologies over complex theories\nand more expansive ontologies. \n\nTo illustrate, Nolan considers the famous example of someone\nsuggesting that the Earth is held up by resting on the back of a giant\nturtle, which is in turn held up by resting on the back of another\nturtle, which is in turn … and so on, turtles all the way\ndown. There does not appear to be an inconsistency hiding in this\nregress, nor does it thwart an attempt at analysis. For all we know,\nspace is infinite, so there’s no problem fitting all these\nturtles in, so we’re not in a case where we know independently\nthat we’re dealing with a finite domain. This is not a regress\nthat involves ontological dependence, so there are no concerns about\nthe existence of things going ungrounded. Of course, we have pretty\ngood empirical evidence that the infinite turtles hypothesis is false,\nsince we have gone into space and can’t see any world\nturtles. But even putting that aside—let’s suppose\nwe’re considering the hypothesis prior to our going into\nspace—there is something intuitively weird about the turtles\nhypothesis. Nolan suggests it is the ontological extravagance of the\nview. He says (2011, 534–5) \n\n[T]he two turtle theory [the world rests on a turtle, which rests on\nanother turtle, which is unsupported] is stranger and more absurd than\nthe one turtle theory, the three turtle theory worse than the two, a\ntwenty-eight turtle theory worse even than the three, an exactly seven\nmillion turtle theory loonier still, and so on. The infinite turtle\ntheory, while perhaps more motivated than the finite turtle theories,\nseems to be in some respects the limit of an increasing sequence of\nabsurdity. \n\nNot everyone will agree that each additional turtle theory is more\nobjectionable than the last, since the extra things being postulated\nare of the same kind (world turtles) as the previous theory already\ncountenanced. David Lewis (1973, 87), e.g., held that while we should\nprefer theories that are more qualitatively\nparsimonious—they postulate fewer kinds of thing than\ntheir rivals—there is no reason at all to prefer theories that\nare merely more quantitatively parsimonious—they\npostulate fewer things\nof the same kind as their rivals. This is controversial,\nhowever, and Nolan (1997) argues that quantitative parsimony is a\ngenuine reason to prefer a theory. If Nolan is correct, the four\nturtle theory is indeed worse than the three turtle theory, the ten\nturtle theory worse still, and the infinite turtle theory worse (other\nthings being equal) than any finite turtle theory. \n\nRoss Cameron applies considerations of theoretical parsimony to the\ncase of infinite chains of ontological dependence. While allowing that\nthere is no impossibility in an infinite regress of things, each\nontologically dependent on the next, Cameron argues that we can still\nhave reason to reject such a theory on parsimony considerations.\nCameron (2008, 12) says that what needs to be explained is the\nexistence of each dependent entity; and while he allows that in an\ninfinitely descending chain of ontologically dependent entities, there\nis an explanation for why each dependent entity exists, there is no\nsingle explanation for why all the dependent entities\nexist. Whereas if there is a collection of fundamental entities on\nwhich all the dependent entities ultimately depend, these fundamental\nentities provide a single unified explanation for why every dependent\nentity exists. Either way, everything that needs to be explained gets\nexplained, but Cameron says we have reason to prefer the unified\nexplanation over the infinitely many disparate explanations, since it\nis in general a theoretical virtue to provide a unified\nexplanation. For example, a physical theory that postulates one\nunified force to explain all phenomena would, other things being\nequal, be preferable to one that postulates four fundamental\nforces—gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear, and weak\nnuclear—even if the two theories explain exactly the same\nphenomena. (Orilia (2009) argues, contra Cameron, that there is no\nunified explanation provided by Metaphysical Foundationalism over\ntheories with infinite ontological descent.) \n\nIf Nolan and Cameron are right it at most gives us a pro\ntanto reason to reject a theory that leads to an ontological\ninfinite regress. Just as we can justifiably accept the more complex\nhypothesis over the simpler one because the more complex hypothesis is\nmore powerful (e.g.), so we might justifiably accept an ontological\ninfinite regress because there is some virtue afforded by the theory\nthat makes the cost worthwhile. Relatedly, Cameron (2008, 13–14)\nargues that this would not give us any reason to think that\nontological infinite regresses are metaphysically impossible, at most\nit gives us a reason to think they are not actual, which limits the\npositions that such regress arguments can be used to argue for. \n\nIn section 3 we considered the suggestion that if the explanation of\nthe \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) appeals to another \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\),\nand so on ad infinitum, then while the \\(F\\)-ness of each\nindividual \\(X\\) can be accounted for, something is left unexplained:\nwhy there are things that are \\(F\\) at all. But arguably, not every\ninfinite regress leaves even this global fact unexplained. \n\nTo say merely that the \\(F\\)-ness of each \\(X\\) is explained by appeal\nto another \\(X\\) that is \\(F\\) leaves open a crucial question: does\nthe \\(F\\)-ness of the new \\(X\\) play a role in the explanation of the\n\\(F\\)-ness of the initial \\(X\\)? Following Bob Hale (2002),\nlet’s distinguish between\ntransmissive explanations of \\(F\\)-ness, in which the\n\\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_2\\) plays a crucial role in explaining the fact that\n\\(X_1\\) is \\(F\\), the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_3\\) plays a crucial role in\nexplaining the fact that \\(X_2\\) is \\(F\\), and so on,\nfrom non-transmissive explanations of \\(F\\)-ness, in which\nthe \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_1\\) is explained by facts concerning \\(X_2\\),\nwhich is in fact \\(F\\), but where the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_2\\) is not\ncrucial to explaining the \\(F\\)-ness of \\(X_1\\), and so on. Arguably\nan infinite regress of transmissive explanations of\n\\(F\\)-ness leaves unexplained why anything is \\(F\\) in the first\nplace, but an infinite regress of non-transmissive explanations need\nnot. \n\nSimon Blackburn (1986) argued that any realist attempt to explain why\nthere is necessity in the world would fail because it faced a\ndilemma. Suppose we say that \\(A\\) is necessary because \\(B\\). \\(B\\)\nat least has to be true, but is \\(B\\) itself necessary? Blackburn\nthought we could not answer no, because to explain the necessity of a\nnecessary truth \\(A\\) by appeal to a contingent truth would undermine\nthe necessity of \\(A\\). But to answer yes is to invite regress, for\nnow we need to explain the necessity of \\(B\\) by appeal to a necessary\ntruth \\(C\\), and so on ad infinitum. Now, whether the\ncontingency horn is indeed vicious is debatable (see Hale 2002 and\nCameron 2010 for discussion), but focus on the regress involved in the\nnecessity horn. Hale (2002) argues that the realist about necessity\ncan resist getting into a vicious regress by distinguishing between\ntransmissive and non-transmissive explanations of the necessity of any\ngiven proposition. Grant that the necessity of \\(A\\) can only be\nexplained by a proposition, \\(B\\), that is itself necessary: that\nexplanation will be transmissive if the necessity of \\(B\\)\nplays a role in explaining the necessity of \\(A\\), otherwise it will\nbe\nnon-transmissive. Hale (ibid., 308–309) offers as an\nexample of a transmissive explanation of the necessity of \\(A\\) a\nproof of \\(A\\) with the necessary truth \\(B\\) as its sole premise. If\n\\(A\\) follows logically from a necessary truth, then \\(A\\) itself must\nbe necessary. And in this case, the necessity of \\(B\\) plays a crucial\nrole in the explanation, for if I do not know whether \\(B\\) is\nnecessary, knowing that it entails \\(A\\) does not tell me whether\n\\(A\\) is necessary, for a contingent proposition can follow from\nanother contingent proposition. In that case, \\(A\\)’s necessity\nseems to be hostage to \\(B\\)’s necessity, and so the ultimate\nexplanation of \\(A\\)’s necessity will seemingly involve whatever\nexplains \\(B\\)’s necessity, which is where Blackburn senses\nregress. But Hale thinks there can also be non-transmissive\nexplanations of necessity. He suggests: ‘Necessarily the\nconjunction of two propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is true only if \\(A\\)\nis true and \\(B\\) is true’ because ‘conjunction just is\nthat binary function of propositions which is true iff both its\narguments are true’ (ibid., 312). While he grants that the\nexplanans in this case is necessary, Hale thinks that its\nnecessity is no part of the explanation. All that is needed to explain\nwhy it is necessary that \\(A \\amp B\\) is true only if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare both true is the\ntruth of the fact that conjunction just is that function\nwhich is true iff both its arguments are true. It may be necessary the\nconjunction is that function, but that is not part of the explanation\nof the original necessity, and thus the necessity of the explanans is\nnot appealed to in a way that makes the success of the explanation\ndependent now on explaining this further necessity. Perhaps there is a\nnew question to be asked concerning why this further claim is\nnecessary, but our original explanation stands independently of\nwhether we can successfully answer this new question. \n\nAnother example. Epistemic Infinitists embrace the infinite regress of\nreasons and argue that it is not vicious (see, e.g., Aikin 2005, 2011,\nKlein 1998, 2003, Peijnenburg 2007 and Atkinson & Peijnenburg\n2017). One response for the Infinitist to make to the regress argument\nis the response from section 3: to hold that each belief is justified\nin virtue of the next one being justified, but to claim that this is\nnot a problem: that while the regress means we do not have an\nexplanation for why anything is justified in the first place, this is\nnot what the sequence was\nmeant to explain—all that we need is an explanation for\neach belief concerning why it is justified, and this we have.\n(See e.g., Aikin 2005, 197 and Klein 2003, 727–729.) \n\nHowever, the Infinitist may also simply deny that anything remains\nunexplained in such a regress. Peter Klein (1998, 2003) holds not only\nthat there can be an infinite regress of justifications, but\nindeed that it is necessary for \\(S\\) to be justified in\nbelieving that \\(p\\) that \\(S\\) have available to them an infinite\nnumber of propositions such that the first of these, \\(r_1\\), is a\nreason for \\(p\\), the second, \\(r_2\\), is a reason for \\(r_1\\), the\nthird, \\(r_3\\), is a reason for \\(r_2\\), and so on ad\ninfinitum. The regress objection seems to presuppose that \\(r_1\\)\nis a reason for \\(p\\) in virtue of (at least in part) \\(r_2\\)\nbeing a reason for \\(r_1\\), etc. (See e.g., Gillett 2003, 713.)  In\nwhich case, so the objection goes, the justificatory chain could not\nget off the ground, and nothing would be justified. But Klein (2003,\n720–723) denies that \\(r_1\\) is a reason for \\(p\\) in virtue\nof \\(r_2\\) being a reason for \\(r_1\\). There must\nbe a reason, \\(r_2\\), for \\(r_1\\), and there must be\na distinct reason for \\(r_2\\), \\(r_3\\), and so on. Each of these\ninfinitely many propositions are justified, but each one’s being\njustified, says Klein, does not hold in virtue of any other\nbeing justified. The Infinitist demands that there is an infinite\njustificatory sequence, but that in itself is silent as to what\njustification consists in. The Infinitist can simply hold\nthat there is some feature \\(F\\) such that for \\(x\\) to be a reason\nfor \\(y\\), \\(\\langle x,y \\rangle\\) has to have \\(F\\), and that\n\\(\\langle r_1,p \\rangle\\) has \\(F\\), and \\(\\langle r_2,r_1 \\rangle\\)\nhas \\(F\\), and so on. That feature could be the first element\nincreasing the objective probability of the second, or something else\nentirely (ibid., 722). The point is, it needn’t involve the\nsecond element itself being justified, and thus the Infinitist need\nnot accept that the justification of \\(p\\) from \\(r_1\\)\nis inherited from the justification of \\(r_1\\) from \\(r_2\\),\nand so on. In Hale’s terminology, the explanation of the\njustification of a proposition by appeal to another justified\nproposition is a non-transmissive one: while one must appeal in the\nexplanation to a proposition that is in fact justified, the fact that\nit is justified plays no role in that explanation. Thus there is,\narguably, no reason to think that the regress of epistemic\njustification is vicious even if you demand an explanation\nfor why any of our beliefs are justified in the first place. \n\nIt’s worth reflecting on the difference between the epistemic\nregress and the ontological regress of dependent entities that makes\nKlein’s response here possible. Suppose that \\(A\\) is\nontologically dependent on \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) ontologically dependent on\n\\(C\\).  It is very plausible that in this case, \\(C\\)’s\nexistence and/or nature is part of the explanation of \\(A\\)’s\nexistence and/or nature. In saying that \\(A\\) is ontologically\ndependent on \\(B\\) we are saying that \\(A\\) exists, or is the way it\nis, at least partly in virtue of \\(B\\)’s existence and/or\nnature. So \\(B\\) has to exist, or be the way it is, in order for \\(A\\)\nto exist, or be the way it is. In explaining \\(A\\)’s\nexistence/nature, we are appealing to \\(B\\)’s existence/nature,\nin which case it seems that anything that we need to explain\n\\(B\\)’s existence and/or nature—in this case \\(C\\)’s\nexistence/nature—must ultimately be part of the explanation of\n\\(A\\)’s existence and/or nature. That’s why when we have a\nchain of ontological dependence, the existence and/or nature of the\nfirst entity seems to be ultimately dependent on not just the\nexistence/nature of the second entity in the chain, but on that of\nevery subsequent entity in the chain: explanations of being appear to\nbe transmissive. Which is why, if the chain is endless, we seem to\nlack an explanation as to why anything exists at all. \n\nBut while it is overwhelmingly plausible that \\(B\\) can only serve as\nthe ontological ground of \\(A\\) because \\(B\\) itself exists,\nor is the way it is, it is not forced on us to hold that\n\\(r_2\\) can only be a reason for \\(r_1\\) because \\(r_2\\) is itself\njustified, and this is why Klein’s response to the epistemic\nregress is available. It need be no part of the explanation for why\n\\(r_2\\) is a reason for \\(r_1\\) that \\(r_2\\) itself be justified. As\nKlein says, the entirety of the explanation for why \\(r_2\\) is a\nreason for \\(r_1\\) might be simply that the objective probability of\n\\(r_1\\) given \\(r_2\\) is sufficiently high. That fact does not involve\n\\(r_2\\) being justified. Klein thinks that \\(r_2\\) must be\njustified if \\(r_1\\) is, but that need not be any part of\nwhy \\(r_2\\) is a reason for \\(r_1\\), and thus there is no\npressure to hold that the justification of \\(r_1\\) by \\(r_2\\) is\ndependent on, or inherited by, the justification of \\(r_2\\) by\n\\(r_3\\), and so on. So while there is indeed an infinite sequence of\npropositions, each of which is a reason for the previous one on the\nlist, at no stage is the fact that one proposition is a reason for\nanother hostage to the fact that any other proposition is a reason for\nanother. And so arguably, nothing remains unexplained: there can be a\ngood explanation not only for why each particular proposition is\njustified (\\(r_5\\) is justified by \\(r_6\\), etc.), but also for why\nthere are any justified propositions in the first place (there are\n propositions that raise the objective probability of others,\n e.g.).[12] \n\nThe Coherentist resists regress by allowing a circular or holistic\nexplanation of the \\(F\\)-ness of at least some \\(X\\)s. This could be\nto simply allow straightforwardly circular explanations, such as that\n\\(X_1\\) is \\(F\\) in virtue of \\(X_2\\) being \\(F\\) and \\(X_2\\) is \\(F\\)\nin virtue of \\(X_1\\) being \\(F\\).  But that is not the only option for\nthe Coherentist. Consider again the regress argument concerning\njustification of belief: our belief \\(p_1\\) is justified by appeal to\n\\(p_2\\), which is in turn justified by appeal to \\(p_3\\), and so\non. There is an assumption behind this regress: that what is to be\nexplained are the facts concerning the individual beliefs—why\nis this one justified, then why is\nthat one justified, etc. An epistemic Coherentist such as\nBonjour (1985) rejects this assumption. It is not, primarily,\nindividual beliefs that are justified, it is systems of\nbelief. A particular belief is justified only in a derivative sense,\nby belonging to a justified system. A system of belief is justified\nbecause of the properties of the system as a whole, namely that the\nbeliefs in it form a coherent system. Thus, justification is a\nholistic phenomenon: a collection of beliefs is justified because of\nwhat they, collectively, are like, not because of what each individual\nmember of the system is like. This holistic explanation of where\njustification comes from is very different from a circular\nexplanation: a circular explanation tells us that one\nindividual’s being \\(F\\) explains another’s being \\(F\\)\nand also vice versa, but a holistic explanation tells us to abandon\nthe idea of explaining an individual’s being \\(F\\) by appeal to\nanother individual being \\(F\\), and instead hold that the explanation\nfor some things being \\(F\\) can be the facts concerning what\nthat collection of things as a whole is like. \n\nSometimes a circular explanation might be warranted because we are not\ntrying to explain in virtue of what the \\(X\\)s are \\(F\\), but rather\nwe are merely attempting to illuminate the \\(X\\)s being \\(F\\) by\nshowing how the \\(X\\)s relate. Consider the regress argument against\nthe thesis that time passes given by J.J.C. Smart (1949, 484): \n\nIf time is a flowing river we must think of events taking time to\nfloat down this stream, and if we say ‘time has flowed faster\ntoday than yesterday’ we are saying that the stream flowed a\ngreater distance today than it did in the same time yesterday. That\nis, we are postulating a second timescale with respect to which the\nflow of events along the first time dimension is measured …\nFurthermore, just as we thought of the first time dimension as a\nstream, so will we want to think of the second time dimension as a\nstream also; now the speed of flow of the second stream is a rate of\nchange with respect to a third time dimension, and so we can go on\nindefinitely postulating fresh streams without being any better\nsatisfied. \n\nHere we start with our ordinary temporal dimension—what we may\nhave supposed to be the only temporal dimension—the one\nphilosophers have in mind when they say that time passes. Smart\nsupposes that if this dimension of time indeed passes then there must\n be a rate at which it\n passes.[13] \n Whether that rate can slow down or speed up or if time always flows at\nthe same rate is not important, but there must be some rate at which\nit passes, thinks Smart. Now, just as we would measure the speed of a\ncar, say, by measuring how much distance it covers in a given amount\nof time, so, thinks Smart, we would have to measure the speed at which\ntime itself passes by measuring how much time passes in a given amount\nof time of some second temporal dimension. While the car covers forty\nmiles of road in the space of an hour, an hour of time passes in the\nspace of, say, two hours of this second temporal dimension. But then,\nhow fast does this second dimension of time pass? We need a third\ntemporal dimension to measure how long it takes for an hour of the\nsecond temporal dimension to pass. But how fast does the third\ntemporal dimension pass? And so on, ad infinitum.  Smart\nconcludes that time does not pass. \n\nA defender of the view that time passes could attempt to resist\nSmart’s regress by cutting off the regress at the second stage\nby claiming that there is a principled difference between the first\ntemporal dimension and the second that results in the first temporal\ndimension passing at some rate, but not the second. Smart himself\nconcludes that time does not pass, so can hardly object to the\npostulation of temporal dimensions that do not pass. However,\nSmart’s regress can be resisted without abandoning the principle\nthat all temporal dimensions pass at some rate. \n\nNed Markosian (1993) points out that to give a rate is to compare two\ndifferent types of change. When we say that the car travels at forty\nmph, we are comparing one type of change—the car started off in\none place and ended up forty miles distant—with another—it\nwas one time and it is now an hour later. In that case, we can always\nget the rate of the second type of change by comparing back to the\nfirst. As Markosian says (ibid., 842): “If … I tell you\nthat Montana’s passing totals increased at the rate of 21 passes\nper game, then I have also told you that the games progressed at the\nrate of one game per 21 completions by Montana.” So suppose we\nsay that the first temporal dimension passes at a rate of one hour for\nevery two hours of the second temporal dimension; there is no need to\ninvoke a third temporal dimension in order to state the rate at which\nthe second passes, for we have already given that rate: an hour of the\nsecond temporal dimension passes for every half hour of the\nfirst. Indeed, as Markosian points out, we need not even invoke a\nsecond temporal dimension, for any time we give a rate of any ordinary\nprocess with respect to time—such as that the Earth goes around\nthe sun once every year—we have thereby stated the rate at which\ntime passes with respect to those ordinary processes: time passes at\nthe rate of one year for every orbit of the Earth around the sun. \n\nMarkosian’s maneuver is possible because in giving the rate of\none process of change by appeal to a second process of change we are\nnot saying what makes it the case that the first change\noccurs at the rate it does. What makes it the case—what are the\nontological grounds of the fact—that the car travels at 40 mph?\nNot that an hour of time passes while the car moves a distance of 40\nmiles, for that is merely a re-description of the fact in question: a\nway of describing the rate. In the case of time itself,\ndefenders of the view that time passes may plausibly claim that\nwhat makes it the case that time passes is simply the nature\nof time: that it is in its nature to pass at the rate it does. It\ndoesn’t pass at the rate it does because of some\nrelation it stands in, either to ordinary processes of change or to a\nsecond temporal dimension. Such relations allow us to\ninformatively state the rate of change, they do not provide\nthe grounds for it. \n\nIf we were providing the metaphysical grounds of rates of change,\nSmart might be right that this would lead to a vicious regress, since\narguably grounding is asymmetric (see e.g., Rosen 2010, 115). If the\ncar travels at the speed it does in virtue of something to do\nwith the passage of time then, arguably, time cannot pass at the rate\nit does in virtue of anything to do with the speed of the\ncar, and so we need to appeal to the passage of a second temporal\ndimension to provide the ontological grounds of the rate of passage of\nthe first. If the passage of this second temporal dimension grounds\nfacts about the passage of the first temporal dimension, it itself\ncannot pass in virtue of facts concerning the passage of the\nfirst, and so we need to appeal to a third temporal dimension, and so\non. And even if we hold that it’s possible for there to\nbe infinitely descending chains of grounds, it seems absurd in this\ncase to suppose that there are in fact infinitely many temporal\ndimensions. But that is not what is going on. When we explain the\nspeed of the car by appeal to the passage of time, we’re not\nproviding the ontological grounds of its speed, we’re simply\nshowing a connection between two things: the movement of the car and\nthe passage of time. Likewise for the rate of time’s passage\nitself: we are not seeking to provide the ontological grounds of\ntime’s passage in stating its rate, for the ontological grounds\nare plausibly just the nature of time itself. Rather, when we compare\nthe two changes, we are simply trying to illuminate one or both of\nthose changes by pointing to the way they relate. That is the only\nsense in which one\nexplains the rate of one change when comparing it to another\nkind of change: the mutual connection tells us something enlightening\nabout each. It is not to give a metaphysical explanation in the sense\nof providing the metaphysical grounds of either rate of\nchange. Compare: if I tell you that the value of a US dollar is 0.7\nBritish pounds (and therefore that the value of a British\npound is 1.43 US dollars), this is not to say that the US dollar has\nthe worth that it has in virtue of standing in this relation\nto the British pound. The US dollar relates thus to the British pound\nbecause of what they are each worth; they are not worth what\nthey are in virtue of standing in that relationship. What makes it the\ncase that the US dollar is worth what it is is some incredibly complex\nset of facts concerning economics, monetary policy, etc.  To give an\nexchange rate is not to give the grounds of the value of the\ncurrencies, but merely to say something substantive about each value\nby stating their connections. Likewise with rates of change, which is\nwhy Markosian is able to resist Smart’s regress in this\nmanner. Coherentist explanations might be controversial when it comes\nto providing ontological grounds, but they are less so when it comes\nto simply casting light on the nature of some phenomena by showing how\nthey connect. So whether a regress argument even gets going will\ndepend on the explanatory ambitions of the view being targeted.","contact.mail":"cameron@virginia.edu","contact.domain":"virginia.edu"}]
