They raise a number of different philosophical issues.\n(1) Whether legal rights are conceptually related to other types of\nrights, principally moral rights; (2) What the analysis of the concept\nof a legal right is; (3) What kinds of entities can be legal\nright-holders; (4) Whether there any kinds of rights which are\nexclusive to, or at least have much greater importance in, legal\nsystems, as opposed to morality; (5) What rights legal systems ought\nto create or recognise. Issue (5) is primarily one of moral and\npolitical philosophy, and is not different in general principle from\nthe issue of what duties, permissions, powers, etc, legal systems\nought to create or recognise. It will not, therefore, be addressed\nhere.\n\n\n\nA preliminary point should be mentioned. Do all legal systems have a\nconcept of rights? Their use is pervasive in modern legal systems. We\ntalk of legislatures having the legal right to pass laws, of judges to\ndecide cases, of private individuals to make wills and contracts; as\nwell as of constitutions providing legal rights to the citizens against\nfellow citizens and against the state itself. Yet it has been suggested\nthat even some sophisticated earlier systems, such as Roman law, had no\nterminology which clearly separated rights from duties (see\nMaine (1861), 269–70 ). The question is primarily one for\nlegal historians and will not be pursued here, but it may be remarked\nthat it may still be legitimate when describing those systems to talk\nof rights in the modern sense, since Roman law, for example, clearly\nachieved many of the same results as contemporary systems. Presumably,\nit did so by deploying some of the more basic concepts into which\nrights can, arguably, be analysed.\n\n\n\nThe position of many important writers on legal rights is difficult\nto ascertain on this point, because it is not one they addressed\ndirectly. Hohfeld (1919), for example, confined his discussion entirely\nto legal rights and never mentioned moral ones. Hart did write about\nmoral rights (1955, 1979) as well as legal ones (1973, 1994), but not in a\nway that allows for much direct comparison. Bentham (1970 [1782]) wrote\nextensively about the analysis of legal rights, but, notoriously,\nthought that the idea of natural moral rights was conceptual\nnonsense. \n\nMill (1969 [1861]), whilst endorsing Bentham’s overall Utilitarian\nposition, did not share his scepticism about moral rights, and seems to\nhave thought that moral and legal rights were, analytically,\nclosely connected — “When we call anything a person’s right, we\nmean that he has a valid claim on society to protect him in the\npossession of it, either by the force of law, or by that of education\nand opinion.” Those things which ought to be so protected were,\nin his view, those which concerned the fundamentals of human\nwell-being, and were therefore a sub-set of those things which a person\nought to have on grounds of utility. \n\nWhilst not necessarily sharing Mill’s view about all rights being\nrelated to fundamentals of well-being, many contemporary writers (e.g.,\nRaz 1984a, 1984b; Wellman 1985, 1995) agree that the core concept\nof a right is something common to law and morality, though some have\nargued that jurisprudential writers, particularly Hohfeld, provide a\nbetter and clearer starting-point for general analysis than previous\nwriters in moral philosophy. The view that the core concept is common\nto both would appear to be consistent with maintaining that,\nnevertheless, in terms of justification in practical reasoning, legal\nrights should be based on moral ones. \n\nNot all philosophers have agreed that rights can be fully analysed.\nWhite (1984), for example, argued that the task is impossible because\nthe concept of a right is as basic as any of the others, such as duty,\nliberty, power, etc (or any set of them) into which it is usually\nanalysed. He agreed, however, that rights can in part be explained by\nreference to such concepts. White’s approach, based largely on close\nlinguistic analysis, has remained something of a minority one. \n\nThe remaining approaches can be categorised in different ways, but a\nmain division is between those who think that rights are singled out by\ntheir great weight as practical reasons, and those who think that\nrights are not special in this regard, but instead are to be analysed\ninto duties, permissions, powers, etc, or some combination of these,\nperhaps with the addition of other conditions. \n\nDworkin (1973, 1975, 1981, 1986), in one formulation of his theory of\nrights, was a proponent of the first view. According to that, rights\nenjoy a categorial priority in weight over any other consideration\nwhich is not itself right-based.  Clearly, it is true of many legal\nsystems that constitutional rights, or some of them, should outweigh\nany other consideration which is not itself derived from a\nconstitutional right. But that seems to be primarily because of the\nconstitutional status of the right. Both in law and in morality many\nrights are of a rather trivial nature. In morality such rights can,\narguably, sometimes be justifiably outweighed even by considerations\nof personal convenience (cf. Raz 1978).  Similarly in law it seems\nthat many prima facie rights can be defeated by what the\ncourt regards as considerations of the general interest. Dworkin’s\n(1977) response to the latter type of criticism was to argue that, on\ncloser inspection, the consideration opposing the right can be seen as\nitself an instantiation of another general right. But this depends on\nthe contentious claim that the only considerations that courts can\njustifiably rely upon are pre-existing rights. The objection has also\nbeen raised that, as a general theory of the nature of rights, it\nrisks being self-defeating, since any consideration whatsoever can\nthen be argued to be right-based, which leaves rights with no special\nrole in practical reasoning. (For discussion of Dworkin’s theory,\nincluding his other formulations, see Yowell 2007.) \n\nMost writers have, instead, favoured the view that rights are to be\nanalysed into other, more basic, notions, principally those of duty,\npermission and power, with perhaps the addition of other criteria. This\nmeans that not all rights will be of great importance. Their importance\nwill vary with the strength of the grounds for the duty, permission or\npower. Before looking more closely at these accounts, another point\nshould be mentioned. Theorists are divided between those who think that\nrights are, as it were, the ‘reflex’ of the duty,\npermission or power, and those who think that the right has a priority\nover them. The question is whether the duty, etc, grounds the right, or\nthe right the duty. Most older writers (e.g., Bentham, Austin, Hohfeld,\nKelsen) appear to have adhered to the first view, whilst more recent\nwriters (e.g., MacCormick, Raz, Wellman) take the second. The second\nview has the implication that the force of a right is not necessarily\nexhausted by any existing set of duties etc, that follow from it, but\nmay be a ground for creating new duties as circumstances change. This\nlatter view seems to accord better at least with the way that\nconstitutional legal rights work. \n\nAmongst those who think that rights can be analysed, at least in\npart, into duties, permissions and powers, there is a further main\ndivision. Some think that the essence of a right is to have choice or\ncontrol over the corresponding duty etc. Others think that the main\nthing is that one’s interests are protected by the duty etc. Hart and\nWellman are amongst the proponents of the first view, Bentham, Austin,\nMacCormick and Raz are amongst those maintaining some version of the\nsecond. \n\nAn outline of Hart’s (1973) theory may be given as an\nillustration of the first view. According to Hart, someone (call him\n‘X’) may be a legal right-holder primarily in one\nof two ways. First of all, X may have a bilateral permission\nto perform some action, i.e., X is permitted both to\nA and to not-A (together with there being some\nprohibitions on others interfering). Secondly, someone else may have a\nduty (e.g., to pay X £10) over which X has\ncontrol, primarily by waiving or enforcing it. Since X has a\nchoice in each case that explains why he is referred to as being a\nright-holder. One difficulty about this kind of theory is to explain\nour apparent reference to rights when there is no choice, eg when one\nis not only entitled to vote in elections, but also obliged by law to\ndo so. \n\nTwo different versions of the interest theory can be seen,\ncorresponding to the question about the priority of rights mentioned\nabove. \n\nAccording to older versions, such as those of Bentham and Austin,\nX is a right-holder because he is the beneficiary, or intended\nbeneficiary, of another’s duty, or perhaps of the absence of a duty on\nhim which the law might otherwise have imposed. For example, if\nX has a right to be paid £10 by Y, then this is\nexplained by saying that Y has a duty, the performance of\nwhich (handing over the £10) is intended to benefit X. One\nproblem about this theory is to explain why the criminal law, although\nit may in part exist to protect moral rights, is not generally regarded\nas directly conferring legal rights on individual citizens, despite the\nfact that they are intended beneficiaries of the corresponding duties.\n(There may, of course, in many systems be parallel civil law rights,\nbut that is a contingent matter. See more on this point below.) \n\nA more modern version of this theory was proposed by MacCormick\n(1977), who argued that a right-holder was the intended beneficiary of\na specific share of benefit, rather than just being a generalised\nbeneficiary of the rules. However, even with this amendment, it remains\ndifficult to explain third party rights under contracts. Suppose\nX and Y enter into a contract which imposes duties on\neach of them with the intention that performance of these will benefit\nZ. According to the theory, Z must (conceptually) be\na legal right-holder. But it is in fact an entirely contingent matter\nas to whether Z is or not. Some legal systems recognise\nZ as having rights in such a situation and others do not. In\nBritain, for example, Scots Law long recognised such rights under\ncertain conditions, but English Law did not until the position was\nchanged by statute in 1999. \n\nMore recent versions, such as those of Raz (1984a, 1984b), take a\ndifferent tack altogether. According to them, to say that X\nis a right-holder is to say that his interests, or an aspect of them,\nare sufficient reason for imposing duties on others either not to\ninterfere with X in the performance of some action, or to\nsecure him in something. This, inter alia, gets round the\nthird-party rights’ problem, because the explanation is simply that it\nis all a question of whether the system recognises the interests of\nZ as part of the reason for X and Y’s\nduties, or whether it is only the interests of X and\nY. Raz (1997) has emphasised that this does not mean that only\nthe right-holder’s interests are relevant to the question of whether\nsomething should be recognised as a right. Considerations of the\ngeneral or common interest may be relevant too. \n\nWhilst discussion has continued on the relative merits of the choice\nand benefit theories, and ever more sophisticated versions of each\nhave been proposed (see, for example, the three-sided debate in\nKramer, Simmonds and Steiner 1998, Kramer 2010, Vrousalis 2010, Van\nDuffel 2012), some writers have attempted to offer different, or\ncombined, approaches.  Wenar (2005) argues for what he calls a\n‘several functions’ theory.  According to this, any ‘Hohfeldian\nincident’ (or combination of them) which grants exemption, discretion\nor authorisation, or entitles the holder to protection, provision or\nperformance is a right.  Kramer and Steiner (2007) claim, however,\nthat this is really no more than another version of benefit theory,\nand not superior to existing ones.  Another proposal is made by\nSreenivasan (2005), which is intended to apply only to claim-rights\nand not to other varieties of right.  The essence of it is\nthat Y has a claim-right that X perform an action if\nand only if Y’s measure of control over X’s duty\nmatches (by design) the measure of control that advances Y’s\ninterests on balance.  This, too, is criticised by Kramer and Steiner\n(2007) on the basis that it would include the case in which someone\nhas, on the basis of his own interests, deliberately not been granted\nany such power at all.  Yet this, they claim, would lead to a highly\nimplausible expansion of the class of those who would have to be\nregarded as right-holders. \n\nA number of subsidiary questions can be raised. \n\nFirstly, should rights be analysed solely in terms of duties on\nothers (together with some other condition), or do we need to bring in\nalso other concepts, such as permission, power and immunity? Hohfeld\nthought that, strictly speaking, something was a legal right only if it\ncorresponded to a duty on another, but he argued that legal usage was\noften confusing because the reference was really to one of the other\nconcepts. Thus, in his view, the law sometimes also said that\nX had a right if (1) he had a permission to A, (2) he\nhad a legal power to A, (3) Y had no legal power to\naffect him. \n\nWhile some (e.g., d’Almeida 2016), have maintained that Hohfeld was\ncorrect to assert that liberty-rights involve only permissions, others\n(e.g., Waldron 1981 and Raz 1984a, 1984b) have been exponents of the\nview that rights should be seen as giving rise only to duties. Hart\n(1973), following Bentham, had argued that a liberty-right should be\nseen as a bilateral permission to A together with duties on\nothers not to interfere with X’s A-ing. Waldron and\nRaz argue that it is an important feature of rights that they entitle\nthe right-holder to do not only that which is right, but also (within\nbounds) that which is wrong. This they regard as best explained by\nseeing rights as imposing only duties of non-interference on others,\nnot as granting the right-holder a permission. (See also Herstein\n2012, 2014.) An alternative view (Campbell 1997) is to see some\nrights as indeed granting permissions, but to point out that in\ngranting a legal permission the law is not saying that there may not\nbe reasons against performing the action, only that (within the bounds\nof the permission) the law will act as if there were not. \n\nPowers raise a different issue. Many writers (e.g., Hohfeld 1919, Hart\n1973) have considered them as being a type of right. By a legal power\nwe mean the ability to bring about changes in legal rules or their\napplication (plus some further conditions). Usually, of course, the\nlawmaker in granting a power also grants a right to exercise it, but\noccasionally this is not so, for example where the exercising of the\nright would itself be a crime or a civil wrong. In English Law, for\nexample, until the position was recently changed by statute, a thief\nhad, in certain special circumstances, the legal power to pass good\ntitle in the goods he had stolen to a third party, even though by doing\nso he committed a civil, and possibly also a criminal, wrong. This\nseems to indicate that powers should not be thought of as being rights\nthemselves. \n\nPowers also illustrate a general problem about the analysis of legal\nrights, and arguably of rights in general. Namely that of whether an\nelement should be seen as part of the very essence of the concept of a\nright, or whether it is merely an element in that which is\n(contingently) its content, i.e., that which there is a right to do or\nhave. \n\nRelatedly, of the four fundamental types of rights which Hohfeld\nclaimed to identify, immunities raise problems, though somewhat\ndifferent ones. An immunity arises when Y has no power to\nchange X’s legal position. But is an immunity itself a right\nor is it simply a means of protecting a right, i.e., by making it\nimmune from removal or alteration? As with powers, views have differed\nabout this. \n\nThere has been much dispute amongst philosophers as what to kinds of\nentities can be right-holders. Corresponding pretty much to the general\ndispute about the very nature of rights, some have argued that any\nentity which would benefit from the performance by others of legal\nduties can be a right-holder; others that it has to be an entity which\nhas interests; others that it has to be an entity capable of exercising\nsome kind of control over the relevant legal machinery. And there are\nvariants of all these positions. \n\nThere has to be a sense in which legal systems can confer rights on\nsuch entities as they please. This is because it has long been\nrecognised that legal systems can regard as legal persons such entities\nas they please. In England, for example, ‘the Crown’ has,\nfor centuries, been regarded as a legal entity, although what this\nmeans in terms of office-holders, far less the actual human beings who\noccupied those offices, has changed greatly over that time. Likewise,\nall modern societies recognise the legal existence as persons of\ncompanies or corporations and frequently of such entities as trade\nunions, government departments, universities, certain types of\npartnerships and clubs, etc. \n\nOne of the most contentious areas in recent years has been whether\nyoung children, the severely mentally ill, non-human animals, areas of\nendangered countryside, etc, can properly be regarded as legal\nright-holders. Clearly anyone who has locus standi before a\ncourt must be a holder of some rights within the system. But it does\nnot seem to follow automatically that an entity which does not, or\nwhich is physically or mentally incapable of bringing a legal action,\nis not thereby a right-holder. For it may be the intention of the\nsystem that the interests of that entity should be represented by\nanother person. Given then, that all these entities may be protected by\nlaw, and that someone can bring some kind of legal action to ensure\nthat those duties are enforced, when would we say that the entity\nitself is a right-holder and when not? \n\nThe answer will often turn upon whether one embraces an interest- or\na choice-theory of rights. MacCormick (1976), for example, argued that\nany theory of rights which could not accommodate children’s rights must\nbe deficient, and this was a reason, in his view, for adopting an\ninterest theory. Wellman (1995), on the other hand, claims that to\nassert that very young children or the severely mentally ill can have\nlegal rights is to distort the concept of a right, since they lack the\nrelevant control of the legal machinery. Instead, he argues, the\nrelevant rights should be seen as belonging only to those who can bring\nthe relevant actions on their behalf. For example, in his view a very\nyoung child would not have a right not to be negligently injured by the\nconduct of another. Rather, it would be the case that the child’s\nparent had a right that their child not be negligently injured. One\ndifficulty about this position appears to be that it does not easily\nsquare with the relevent remedial rights (e.g., to damages) that the\nlaw would recognise. In this example the law would clearly compensate\nthe child’s loss in being injured, not the parent’s loss in their child\nbeing injured (though the latter might be a separate ground of action\nin some systems). \n\nThe issue here is: whether there are any fundamental aspects of rights\nwhich are exclusive to, or at least more important in, legal systems,\nas opposed to morality.  \n\nFive particular sub-issues may be raised here. \n\nRemedial rights are those which arise because of a breach of a primary\none. Clearly they arise also outside the law, for example a duty to\napologise or make amends even if there is no legal obligation to do\nso. But legal remedial duties are generally more precise, and, just by\nthe nature of law, institutionalised. \n\nIt is one of the main functions of legal systems to provide remedies\nfor breach (or sometimes anticipated breach) of the primary rights\nwhich they confer. So if someone is injured by the negligence of\nanother there will usually arise a remedial right to damages. If he is\nkilled there may arise in members of his family an independent right to\ncompensation, and so on. Other types of remedial right can include\nthose for court orders requiring the party at fault to execute, or\nrefrain from, some particular course of action, very often that which\nthey had a duty to do, or to refrain from, under the primary right.\nSuch rights are often very complex in the detail. For example the\nmeasure of damages may be different if the wrongful act is a\ntort/delict, as opposed to a breach of contract. Likewise, in many\nsystems, some remedies must be granted as a matter of right whilst\nothers are at the discretion of the court. By way of illustration of\nthe remedies in the two British legal systems, reference may be made to\nLawson (1980) and Walker (1974). \n\nUsually remedial rights will themselves have further remedial rights\nattached, for example, to have the court impose a more coercive order,\nperhaps with the threat of a criminal or quasi-criminal sanction, or to\nhave a person’s assets frozen or confiscated, in the event, for\nexample, that someone has failed to pay damages previously awarded by\nthe court. The details of these further remedial rights vary from\nsystem to system. \n\nA related, more controversial, point is as to whether criminal, as\nopposed to civil, law confers any legal rights on the citizens\nprotected by it. The orthodox view is that it does not, although there\nmay well be a parallel civil right. Take the case of someone who is\nwrongfully assaulted. In most legal systems this will be both a crime\nand a tort/delict. The civil law clearly gives a remedial right, eg. to\nsue for damages. But since, in most jurisdictions, it is mainly (and\nsometimes exclusively) the state which decides whether to prosecute for\nthe criminal aspect, the more usual view is that the citizen has no\nlegal right corresponding to the criminal aspect. \n\nThe issue is often complicated, legally, by the absence of clear\nindication from the legislature as whether it intended, by a particular\nstatute, to create only a crime or also to confer civil law rights on\ncitizens. A further complication can be that criminal courts sometimes\nexercise a quasi-civil function (e.g., to make a restoration or\ncompensation order after a conviction for theft), and vice\nversa (e.g., the power of a civil court to award punitive or\nexemplary damages). \n\nThis issue is different from that of whether criminal law can act to\nrecognise and protect moral rights. It seems possible to suggest that\nit can, since moral rights can be protected not only by legal rights,\nbut also by legal duties on others (without corresponding legal\nrights). For example, a legal system could create a criminal offence of\nharassment in order to protect a moral right to privacy, without\nthereby necessarily recognising a legal right to privacy, i.e.,\nsomething which would act as a positive reason in favour of privacy in\ninterpreting unclear rules, or in developing the law. \n\nIn the case of many legal rights a condition has to be satisfied for\ntheir possession or exercise. This, in itself, does not make legal\nrights different from many moral ones. Just as one has a legal right to\ndamages for assault only if one has been assaulted, one has a moral one\nto an apology for being insulted only if one has been insulted. But\nlegal rights can give rise to more complicated situations, which rarely\narise in morality. \n\nIn the above examples we can say that the right-token, as opposed to\nthe right-type, comes into existence only when the condition for its\ninstantiation is triggered. But legal systems sometimes say that that\nthe right-token exists before one of the conditions for the exercise of\nthe right exists. Essentially, it is the difference between saying\n“if p, X has a right to A” and\n“X has a right, if p, to A.” In\nthe latter case the implication is that the right-token exists now, not\njust that it will exist. Why should we say this? One proposed answer is\nthat legal systems, unlike morality, have devised sets of rules for\ntransmission of rights even before the triggering condition for the\nexercise of the right has arrived. \n\nSuppose, for example, that X, under his will, left a sum of\nmoney to Y, on condition that Y had attained the age\nof 21. It may be that the correct way of understanding the provision,\nunder the rules of the legal system, is that only if Y had\nattained 21 when X died does he have a right to the money. But\nit may be that the correct way of understanding it as saying that\nY, even if he has not attained 21 when X dies,\nacquires a right to the money, but it is to be paid only when he is 21.\nOne practical difference is that in the latter case the right can pass\nto Y’s successor in title if Y, having survived X,\nnevertheless dies before he is 21. In the latter case, lawyers describe\nthe right as ‘vested.’ There can be many complex legal\nrules relating to this type of situation, and they vary greatly from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. Reference should be made to textbooks,\nprimarily on testamentary succession, in the jurisdiction. \n\nA further particular kind of legal rights, or group of rights, which\nhas received an increasing amount of attention from theorists is that\nof property rights. Discussion of this belongs more properly to that of\nproperty itself — see the entry on\n property.\n Only some very brief points will be made here. \n\nThe first is as to whether property rights, and hence the concept of\nproperty, are essentially legal in their nature, or whether they are\nmore general social phenomena which are simply recognised and protected\nby law in all modern societies. According to Bentham (1843) “\n… there is no natural property … property is entirely the\ncreature of the law.” Bentham’s argument is essentially that what\nwe mean by property is security of expectation in being able to keep,\nsell, use, etc, objects, and only the law can guarantee such\nsecurity. \n\nOn the other hand, it is certainly possible to talk coherently about\nproperty in a way that does not necessarily correspond to the legal\nposition. A parent may for example say to a young child that a certain\ntoy is theirs, though in law it is the parent’s. Likewise it may be\nplausible to claim that concepts of ownership and possession, though\nthey may be less securely protected, can exist in societies which do\nnot have anything that we normally recognise as a fully-fledged legal\nsystem. Some people will perhaps regard these kind of examples as\nindications that the concept of property is not essentially legal,\nwhilst others may incline to the view that these are simply\nmetaphorical extensions of a concept which is legal au\nfond. \n\nSecondly, it should be noted that, in law, property rights can be of\nmany different types. Although ownership is obviously one of the most\nimportant, another major class is that of possession, whether temporary\nor relatively permanent. For example, the right to use a car which one\nhas hired for a week or to live in a certain house for the rest of\none’s life. Yet other types, falling short of either ownership or\npossession, could be, for example, to walk across the local farmer’s\nfield or have one’s next-door neighbour maintain his side of the joint\ngarden wall. \n\nThe details of property rights vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction\nperhaps more than those of almost any other types of right. Further,\nmany jurisdictions have different rules relating to property rights in\nland (and its fixtures) as opposed to all other types of entity. For\nthese details reference should be made to specialist books in the\njursdiction.  (Cf. Hume 1740, Book III, Section III, where he\ndiscusses the notions that, in his view, lie behind rules of\noccupation, prescription, accession and succession, by which property\nmay be acquired. He points out that not infrequently one cannot\nsensibly claim that a rule of particular content is better than one of\nsomewhat different content.  The important thing is, rather,\nthat some legal rule on the matter exists.) \n\nEven when considering just ownership, there is debate amongst\ntheorists as to how this should be analysed. Some see it as essentially\na cluster of other property rights of particular content, such as those\nto possession, income, etc, whilst others see it as being basically a\nstructural relation between rights, content being comparatively\nirrelevant. For example as being the person to whom possession or use,\neven though those may presently belong to others, would ultimately\nreturn if a certain series of contingent events were to occur. \n\nFor further discussion of property in a philosophical context see\nHonore 1960, 1961; Becker 1977; Waldron 1988; Munzer 1990;\nCampbell 1992; Harris 1996; and Penner 1997. (Some of these are\nconcerned more with the moral justification of ownership.) \n\nThe above account of rights has been written largely from the point\nof view of Anglo-American law and philosophy. It should, however, be\nmentioned that there is one aspect of legal rights which is to be found\namongst the European Continental writers, but of which there is no\ntrace in the Anglo-American tradition. That is the description of\nrights as being ‘subjective’ (droits subjectifs;\nsubjektive Rechte). \n\nIn French and in German the same word (droit,\nRecht) serves as the noun which refers both to rules of law\nand the rights which are created by them, and therefore disambiguation\nis required. \n\nIn French law the distinction is drawn by distinguishing between\nle Droit objectif (the noun spelt with a capital according to\nsome, but not all, writers) and les droits subjectifs. (For\ngeneral discussion see, for example, Cornu 2014.) However, French law\nseems at the same time to confine the term ‘droits\nsubjectifs’ to a sub-class of legal rights, namely rights\nwhich are primarily those of private citizens, eg to make a will or\ncontract. The term appears not to extend to such rights as those of a\ngovernment agency owning property or a government minister making a\nlegal order under delegated powers. \n\nGerman law seems to draw a basically similar distinction between\n‘das Recht’ and ‘subjektive\nRechte’ (see, for example, Dietl & Lorenz 2016/2005). \n\nMany of the issues relating to this are not confined to rights, but\nare shared with duties and powers, so only a brief outline will be\ngiven. \n\nIn most modern legal systems certain fundamental rights are\nconferred by the constitution. This usually gives them a certain degree\nof priority over competing legal considerations, but this can vary from\nsystem to system. Sometimes constitutional rights will have an absolute\npriority over any other consideration not itself based on a\nconstitutional right. Sometimes they will merely favour one legal\noutcome rather than another, without dictating it. \n\nConstitutions will vary, too, as to whether certain rights are\n‘entrenched’ or not. Entrenchment can be absolute, in which\ncase the rights cannot be removed or altered by any constitutional\nmeans (as is the case with some of the ‘basic rights’ in\nthe German Constitution), or it can be relative, requiring only a more\nonerous procedure than that for normal legislation (as with the\nConstitution of the USA.). \n\nConstitutions will also vary on the extent to which human rights\nrecognised under international law or treaty are recognised in national\nlaw. For example, in some countries in Europe, the European Convention\non Human Rights, and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights\nthereon, are incorporated into national law and override any national\nlaw inconsistent with them. In others, such as the United Kingdom, the\ncourts have, so far as possible, to interpret legislation to be\nconsistent with the Convention, but have no power to strike it down even if\nthey find it to be clearly inconsistent. \n\nOther rights can be conferred by normal legislation or by common law\n(ie. the tradition of judge-made law). One interesting point is that,\narguably, many legal rights are conferred by no positive law, but arise\nsimply from the absence of any law to the contrary. That is, it is\nprobably a practical necessity that every legal system has an unwritten\n‘closure rule’ to the effect that whatever is not\nprohibited is permitted. If some types of rights are essentially\npermissions, then many such rights arise in this way. In most legal\nsystems my right to cross the street, for example, is of this nature.\nProbably no positive law will say that I can do so, and possibly no\nmore general enacted right will imply it.","contact.mail":"kenneth.campbell@kcl.ac.uk","contact.domain":"kcl.ac.uk"}]
