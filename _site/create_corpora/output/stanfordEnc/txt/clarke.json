In all three\nareas he was very critical of Hobbes, Spinoza, and Toland. Deeply\ninfluenced by Newton, Clarke was critical of Descartes’\nmetaphysics of space and body because of the experimental evidence for\nNewtonianian doctrines of space, the vacuum, atoms, and attraction and\nbecause he believed Descartes’ identifying body with extension\nand removing final causes from nature had furthered irreligion and had\nnaturally developed into Spinozism.\n\n\nClarke sided with Locke and Newton against Descartes in denying that\nwe have knowledge of the essence of substances, even though we can be\nsure that there are at least two kinds of substances (mental and\nmaterial) because their properties (thinking and divisibility) are\nincompatible. He defended natural religion against the naturalist view\nthat nature constitutes a self-sufficient system and defended revealed\nreligion against deism. Clarke adopted Newton’s natural\nphilosophy early on. Through his association with Newton, Clarke was\nthe de facto spokesperson for Newtonianism in the first half\nthe eighteenth century, not only explaining the natural science but\nalso providing a metaphysical support and theological interpretation\nfor it.\n\n\nIn what follows, we use “W” as an abbreviation to cite\npassages from the four-volume The Works, edited posthumously\nby Benjamin Hoadly. Two recent editions of Clarke’s major works\nare more widely available and thus cited here as well: “D”\nfor passages in A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God\nand Other Writings in Vailati (1998), and “CC” for\npassages in The Correspondence of Samuel Clarke and Anthony\nCollins (Uzgalis (ed.) 2011). References to the Leibniz-Clarke\ncorrespondence (available in many print and online editions) include\nthe letter and section number preceded by an “L” for\nLeibniz and “C” for Clarke (e.g., L 1.4 refers to\nLeibniz’s first letter, section four).\n\nSamuel Clarke was born on October 11, 1675, in Norwich, England to\nEdward Clarke (a cloth merchant, alderman, and representative in\nParliament) and Hannah, daughter of Samuel Parmenter, a merchant\n(Hoadly 1730, i). He took his B.A. degree at Cambridge in 1695 by\ndefending Newton’s views, which were not yet widely accepted.\nHis oral defense “suprized the Whole Audience, both for the\nAccuracy of Knowledge, and Clearness of Expression, that appeared\nthrough the Whole” (Hoadly 1730, iii-iv). \nHis tutor, Sir John Ellis, a Cartesian, apparently encouraged Clarke\nto provide a new annotated Latin translation of\nRohault’s Treatise of Physics. The 1697 translation\nincluded Clarke’s Newtonian notes that criticized\nRohault’s Cartesian text. The edition’s success rapidly\nexpanded the understanding of Newtonian physics, and later editions\nbecame the standard physics textbook in England. In that same year,\nClarke befriended William Whiston, who probably introduced Clarke into\nthe Newtonian circle. These early years show Clarke’s interest in\ntheology as well; he published Three practical essays on baptism,\nconfirmation, and repentance (1699), A Paraphrase on the Four\nEvangelists (1701–1702), and Some Reflections on that\nPart of a Book called Amyntor (1699), a response to John\nToland’s critique of the New Testament canon. These all\ndemonstrate Clarke’s early interest in “primitive Christianity”\n(Christianity as practiced and believed in its first two hundred\nyears), which would be central to his theological vision and would\nlead to the confrontations over the doctrine of the trinity in the\n1710s. \nThe middle years of his career mark his greatest philosophical\ncontributions, beginning with the Boyle lectures (delivered 1704 and\n1705). The first, an attempt to prove the existence of God, along with\nall divine attributes, was published as A Demonstration of the\nBeing and Attributes of God (1705) and the second, a continuation\nintended to establish all fundamental moral truths and most religious\ndoctrine, as A discourse concerning the unchangeable obligations\nof natural religion, and the truth and certainty of the Christian\nrevelation (1706). They both went through many editions and were\noften published together. These lectures, established by Robert Boyle\nto promote natural religion based on the latest scientific\ndevelopments, were closely watched, and Clarke instantly became one of\nthe most well known philosophers in England. Also in 1706, his\nassociation with Newton became official when he translated the\nOpticks into Latin. In the meantime, he had been introduced\nto Queen Anne, who made him one of her chaplains in 1706, and three\nyears later he was elevated to the rectory of St. James’s,\nWestminster. After the Hanoverian accession, Clarke developed a close\nrelationship with Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales and\nfuture queen. His prominence as a philosopher drew him into a series\nof very public exchanges of letters. The most notable of these were\nthe letters to Anthony Collins (1707–1708) and the letters to\nLeibniz (1715–1716) (see below). \nIn the later years of his life, Clarke published popular works of\ntheology, notable translations of Caesar, and a royally appointed\ntranslation of the Iliad. Each of his major publications went\nthrough multiple editions, often with substantial revision. He died in\n1729 after a very short illness, consistent with a stroke (Sykes 1729,\n10). He was survived by his wife Katherine and five of his seven\nchildren. Clarke was a polite and courtly man, vivacious with his\nfriends, and reportedly fond of playing cards. \nBefore Caroline of Ansbach became the Princess of Wales, she was\ntutored by Leibniz. Leibniz did not join her in England, and they\ncorresponded across the channel. In one of these letters he attacked\nprominent views in England that Leibniz considered dangerous to\nnatural religion. After mentioning materialism and Lockean doubts\nabout the soul, Leibniz chastises Newton twice. (Newton and Leibniz\nhad sparred earlier over the priority of discovery of the calculus.)\nClarke, who with Newton was attending Caroline’s court, came to\nNewton’s defense. A series of five letters passed through\nCaroline between Leibniz and Clarke over a wide range of issues.\nCaroline is significant not only for her contributions to framing the\ndebate for each correspondent but also as an important context for\nunderstanding the letters (Meli 1999). Leibniz is trying to maintain\nCaroline’s commitment to his system, while Newton and especially the\nmore sociable Clarke are working to convert her with arguments and\nexperimental demonstrations in person. She continued to challenge\nClarke and pledge loyalty to Leibniz until his death, but starting\naround the time of the third letter, it seems that Clarke had won her\nover at least to the existence of the vacuum, which would be difficult\nto maintain without going for the rest of the Clarkean-Newtonian\npicture (Brown 2004, 93–98). \nToday the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is easily Clarke’s most\noften read work, which is unfortunately usually published without the\ncover letters to and from Caroline. However, there has long been a\ndispute over Newton’s role in the authorship of the letters.\nLeibniz suspected and Caroline confirmed that Newton at least read\nClarke’s letters before sending them and provided\n“advice” (Alexander 1956, 189 and 193; Brewster 1855,\n287–288). Since then, scholarly opinion has ranged from\nNewton’s ghostwriting all the letters himself (Koyré and\nCohen 1961, 560ff) to Clarke writing the letters and merely showing\nthem to Newton to make sure there was no disagreement over the\nscientific information (Vailati 1997, 4–5). This point is not\neasily decidable, in part because Newton and Clarke were neighbors and\nthus almost no correspondence survives between them, presumably since\nthey would meet in person. Current opinion has shifted toward\nattributing most of the philosophical arguments to Clarke, with the\nblessing of Newton, a move sparked in part by a reappraisal in recent\nyears of Clarke’s status as an original philosopher. \nIn reading the letters to Leibniz, it is helpful to remember that the\nviews being defended might not belong only to Clarke or only to\nNewton, so attribution to a single figure might be misguided. What we\nhave might be the intersection of their views, or they might be views\nthat Newton held privately but did not yet want to avow publicly, or\nthey might be a mixture of some of Clarke’s views and some of\nNewton’s views. In some cases, we can see links to other\npublications by Newton and Clarke. For instance, space as a\nsensorium (organ of sensation) of God, which Leibniz\nridiculed in his first letter to Caroline, appeared first in\nNewton’s Principia and Opticks and not in\nClarke’s other works. (Clarke tries to argue that Newton does\nnot believe that space is the sensorium of God, but\nKoyré and Cohen [1961, 563–566] argue that Newton did\nbelieve it and tried to disguise or soften the view in publication.)\nAlso, there are arguments based on the principle of sufficient reason,\nwhich Clarke employed in his Boyle lectures twelve years earlier, but\ndo not play a role in Newton’s publications. Other cases are\nmore difficult to connect to Newton’s and Clarke’s other\nworks, such as the famous passage in which space is called “an\nimmediate and necessary consequence of the existence of God,”\nsince “consequence” is not a term usually used by either\nClarke or Newton on this issue. \nThree major themes run through all of Clarke’s philosophical\nworks: Newtonianism, anti-naturalism, and rationalism. \nThere is a widespread agreement that Newton influenced Clarke. Newton\nwas thirty years Clarke’s senior, and their relationship (post-1704)\nmight best be thought of as a mentorship. Newton and Clarke likely\nheld similar views about God’s role in the world, but Newton was\nhesitant to state these positions publicly, and he may have used the\nBoyle lectures to promote these views (Force 1984; 522–526).\nMany have thought he supported Clarke’s interpretations and\ndefenses on matters scientific and also theological (Jacob 1976; 242).\nIn private correspondence, such as the letters to Bentley of December\n10, 1692, and January 17, 1693, he entertains views similar to those\nthat Clarke would later proclaim. Whiston (1728) reports that when\nasked why he did not publicly announce them, Newton said, “He\nsaw those Consequences; but thought it better to let his Readers draw\nthem first of themselves,” at least until the “General\nScholium” was published in later editions of the\nPrincipia. However, it is also possible that Clarke\ninfluenced Newton. Newton, at least, endorsed publicly views that had\nbeen previously published by Clarke, especially in the “General\nScholium” of 1713, which was seen to endorse Clarkean arguments\nabout the nature of God (Stewart 1996; Snobelen 2001, 14–18). \nOn scientific, philosophical, and especially theological grounds,\nClarke believed Newtonian natural philosophy to be superior to all\nalternatives. Clarke saw in Newtonianism a world that could only exist\nby a free act of God. Matter is dispersed sparingly throughout empty\nspace, gravity is universal to matter but not inherent in it, and the\nuniverse is ordered according to rules that are neither absolutely\nnecessary nor chaotic. Clarke concluded that the laws of nature do not\ndescribe the powers of matter, which is just dead mass constantly\npushed around, but modalities of operation of the divine power.\nClarke’s position is similar to that of the occasionalists, who\nalso denied that matter had the power to move itself and that the only\nthing with such power is God. Matter has no power of self-motion, so\nto explain motion, one must appeal to immaterial souls (divine and\nhuman). Thus, nature is not a self-sufficient system; without direct\nand constant divine physical intervention planets would fly away from\ntheir orbits and atoms would break into their components. Thus, the\nnaturalist attempt to describe the world solely by the arrangement and\nmatter in motion is doomed to failure on scientific and metaphysical\ngrounds and must give way to a world with an active God. This is why\n“the foundations of natural religion had never been so deeply\nand firmly laid, as in the mathematical and experimental philosophy of\nthat great man” (W4.582). Newton’s natural philosophy could\nthus be the argumentative basis for Clarke’s preferred religious and\nsocial views (Stewart 1981). \nFor three decades, Clarke was the leading voice on the metaphysical\nand theological implications of Newtonianism, confirmed when Newton\nhimself seemed to endorsed publicly the fundamentals of Clarke’s\ninterpretation in the revisions to the Principia. \nClarke adopted some form of rationalism in metaphysics, ethics, and\ntheology, as exhibited in his methodology, his account of ethical\ntruths, and in his acceptance of a fundamental rationalist principle,\nthe principle of sufficient reason. The principle of sufficient reason\nwas used both in Clarke’s positive metaphysical arguments and was\nassumed in his arguments against other philosophers, especially\nSpinoza, whom he chastises for failing to explain the diversity of\nthings that exist (Yenter 2014). \nClarke is also an ethical rationalist. Ethical truths are discoverable\nthrough reason and correspond to necessary and eternal relations among\nthings in the world. He also calls ethical truths “truths of\nreason.” His theology is also rationalist, in that through\nreason one can discover the many truths contained in natural religion.\nFurthermore, true Christian doctrines are neither mysterious nor\nself-contradictory, and nearly all can be comprehended by human\nbeings. \nMost importantly, the Demonstration makes great use of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason, which motivates the cosmological\nargument, and he explicitly and repeatedly avows it in the\ncorrespondence with Leibniz (C 3.2, W 4.606). It is not mentioned in\nthe correspondence with Collins, but he there adopts principles that\ncan be derived from it. Clarke’s understanding of the principle\nof sufficient reason differs notably from Leibniz’s formulation,\nwith whom it is more frequently associated. This was a major source of\ncontention in their correspondence. Clarke asserts that the sufficient\nreason why something exists as it does may be due to the “mere\nWill” of God and nothing more (C 3.2, W 4.606–607; C\n5.124–130, W 4.700). This involves two claims. First, in cases\nof complete indifference (such as God choosing where to place the\nworld in the infinite expanse of absolute space), God is capable of\nacting even if there is no reason to prefer one option over another.\nSecond, a free will is able to refrain from acting on what reason\npresents to it as best to do. As a consequence of these, Clarke denies\nthe identity of indiscernibles. This is significant for Clarke’s\nNewtonianism, because if space is real and absolute, then the identity\nof indiscernibles must be false because regions of space are\nindiscernible with respect to their intrinsic and (prior to the\ncreation of the world) their extrinsic properties. Clarke may also\nhave felt the need to accommodate indiscernible atoms, which Newton\nseemed to allow. (Clarke defends atomism in the letters to Leibniz,\nbut in his other works he claims that all matter is infinitely\ndivisible.) Because Clarke denies the identity of indiscernibles and\naffirms libertarianism, Leibniz claims that Clarke grants the\nprinciple of sufficient reason “only in Words, and in reality\ndenies it. Which shews that he does not fully perceive the Strength of\nit” (L 3.2, W 4.601). In response, Clarke argues that if Leibniz\nis right then a free agent would be merely passive because determined\nto do what reason presents, but a “passive agent” is a\ncontradiction since the concept of agency includes the concept of\nactivity. Leibniz was never satisfied with Clarke’s position and by\nthe fifth letter he was more explicit than previously that the\nprinciple of sufficient reason and the principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles are not independent but the latter is derived from the\nformer (L 5.21), and in the fifth letter’s cover letter, sent to\nPrincess Caroline, Leibniz asserts, “If [Clarke] does not entirely\naccept the received great principle that nothing happens without there\nbeing a sufficient reason why it happens thus rather than otherwise, I\ncould not help doubting his sincerity, and if he grants it then\nfarewell to the philosophy of Monsieur Newton” (quoted in Khamara\n2006, 4). \nClarke’s rationalism is tempered by his discussions of faith in\nreason, especially in his writings against the Deists. Against the\nDeists, who generally expected all necessary moral and religious\ntruths to be discoverable by reason, Clarke asserted that revealed\nreligion (also called special revelation) provided information\nnecessary for salvation (W 2.666–667). While special revelation\ninvolved “supplying the deficiencies” of “right reason,” it\ncould not contradict reason (W 2.669). \nAccording to Clarke, the ideas of space and time are the two\n“first and most obvious simple Ideas, that every man has in his\nmind” (D 114, W 2.752), anticipating the first step in an\nargument made famous by Kant. Drawing on an argument from Newton\n(1726, 410), he argued that while matter can be thought of as\nnon-existing, space exists necessarily because “to suppose any\npart of space removed, is to suppose it removed from and out of\nitself: and to suppose the whole to be taken away, is supposing it to\nbe taken away from itself, that is, to be taken away while it still\nremains: which is a contradiction in terms” (D 13, W 2.528).\nSpace is also not an aggregate of its parts but an essential whole\npreceding all it parts. \nAbsolute space was allegedly demanded by Newtonian physics. Space is\nan entity in which things are, and not the mere absence of matter. All\nfinite beings occupy an absolute position in space and time that we\nmay or may not be able to establish because we have no direct access\nto absolute space and time. Although space is not sensible, Clarke\nrejected its identification with nothingness, since space has\nproperties: quantity and dimension, and perhaps homogeneity,\nimmutability, continuity, and the ability to contain matter. Law\n(1758, 10) objects that this makes no more sense than saying that\ndarkness has qualities because it has the property of receiving\nlight. \nClarke believed that space is necessarily infinite because “to\nset bounds to space, is to suppose it bounded by something which\nitself takes up space” or else that “it is bounded by\nnothing, and then the idea of that nothing will still be space,”\nand both suppositions are contradictory (D 115, W 2.753). Clarke\napparently thought that what has a boundary must be bounded by\nsomething else. If so, the argument was not well taken because a\nsphere, for example, has a boundary which stems from its own nature,\nnot by the presence of something external bounding it (Vailati 2006,\n111). One possible solution is to appeal to space’s peculiar\nnature as a property of an infinite God, which would require that it\nbe boundless in virtue of God’s possible activity being\nboundless (W 1.47), but this might reverse the proper order of\nexplanation or beg the question. (For more on the relationship of God\nto space, see Section 4.2 below.) He also argues that because\nexistence or being is a perfection, existing in more places is a\ngreater perfection, so God (as the most perfect being) must exist in\nall places (W 1.46–47). Another possible solution is to appeal\nto the principle of sufficient reason: any finite limit would be\narbitrary, and thus in violation of the principle. Establishing the\ninfinity of space is important to Clarke’s argument that space\nexists outside of us, because our ideas are always finite (Watts 1733,\n4). \nClarke attached great importance to the issue of free will, and he may\nhave introduced the modern philosophical meaning of the term\n“agency” (Schneewind 1997, 313). In his philosophical\nwritings, he argues that freedom of the will involves a libertarian\npower of self-determination. However, in the sermon “Of the\nLiberty of Moral Agents,” he claims that the “True liberty\nof a Rational and Moral Agent” is “being able to follow\nright Reason only, without Hindrance or Restraint” (W\n1.219). Similarly, in that sermon Clarke calls acting as one pleases\n“mere physical or\nnatural liberty” (which humans and non-human animals\nhave), so he seems to accept a definition of liberty that is\ncompatibilist (W 1.218). Elsewhere he argues that human freedom\nrequires a self-determining will that could freely assent or refrain\nfrom assenting to the mind’s judgments; this is a freedom of\nchoosing and not a freedom of acting, such that a prisoner in chains\n“who chooses or endeavors to move out of his place is therein as\nmuch a free agent as he that actually moves out of his place” (D\n75, W 2.566). Clarke does not explicitly reconcile these\nincompatibilist and compatibilist approaches. One way to do so is to\nmake the libertarian power of self-determination a necessary condition\nfor the compatibilist understanding of freedom as following reason\nwithout restraint. Clarke also entertains a third notion of freedom:\nfreedom is “a principle of acting, or power of beginning motion,\nwhich is the idea of liberty” (D 54, W 2.553). The ability to\nbegin motion marks freedom as a power only held by non-material\nagents, because matter has no power of self-motion. This third\ndefinition is libertarian and is probably the most important of the\nthree to Clarke’s project (Harris 2005, 46–61; Greenberg 2013,\n249–251). \nClarke’s primary defense of libertarian freedom involves\nclarifying the relationship between the will and the judgment. In\norder to will, one must have a judgment about what to do and the power\nto choose in accordance with that judgment. This power to choose is\nprovided by the will. The will is not to be identified with the last\njudgment of the understanding nor is it a volition caused by a judgment.\nThose (like Hobbes) who thought so were guilty of basic philosophical\nerrors. If they maintained that the content of the evaluative\nproposition is either identical with the volition or causes it, then\nthey were confusing the “moral motive” with the\n“physical efficient,” the physical efficient being the\nelement of the cause that provides the active power (D 73, W 2.565).\nBecause the moral motive is simply an abstract object (a proposition)\nand abstract objects are causally inert, the moral motive cannot cause\nanything. On the other hand, if Clarke’s opponents maintained\nthat, not the evaluative proposition, but one’s perceiving,\njudging or otherwise believing it is the cause (or a partial cause) of\nvolition, then they were falling foul of a basic causal principle.\nAgainst Descartes, Clarke insisted that judging, i.e., assenting to\nwhat appears true and dissenting from what appears false, is not an\naction but a passion. But what is passive cannot cause anything\nactive. So, there is no causal link between evaluation and volition,\nor, as Clarke put it, between “approbation and action” (D\n126, W 4.714). In general, there is no causal link between previous\nnon-volitional mental states, all of which are passive, and any\nvolition (Vailati 1997, 82–84). \nJonathan Edwards (1754, 222–223) argued that Clarke was\ncommitted to an infinite regress of volitions. Because each volition\nis active, it must be caused by something active; but every other\npurported motivation is passive, so each volition is caused by a\nprevious volition, and so on ad infinitum. However, Clarke\ndid not believe that each volition was caused by a previous volition,\nbut rather each volition is caused by the will itself. This raises a\ndifferent problem, noticed by Leibniz: because the conditions for the\nwill choosing in accordance with the judgment are exactly the same as\nwhen it refrains from choosing, there is no explanation for why it\ndoes one rather than the other, in violation of the principle of\nsufficient reason (L 4.1, W 4.612; L 5.14, W4.634). Clarke never\nprovided a satisfactory response to this charge; his best attempt is\nhis claim that to deny this account would lead to accepting passive\nagency, which is a contradiction. \nDivine freedom raises new problems for Clarke. For one, human and\ndivine freedom are perhaps in tension with God’s knowledge of\nfuture events. Against the claim that divine foreknowledge is\nincompatible with free will, Clarke objected that because knowledge\ndoes not affect the thing known, our free choices are unaffected by\ndivine omniscience (D 75–78, W 2.566–568). A second\nproblem is that God always does what is best, so God cannot refrain\nfrom acting on his judgment of what is best, and thus acts\nnecessarily, which Clarke claims is a contradiction (D 83–86, W\n571–573). Clarke could rely, again, on the passivity of judgment\n(or the difference between physical causes and moral reasons) to block\nthe move that God’s judgment determines God’s choice.\nThus, even though we have complete certainty that God always does what\nis best, it does not follow that God doing the best is necessitated by\nGod’s judgment of what is right to do. This response is nested\nin Clarke’s official response, which is to distinguish\nGod’s metaphysical attributes from his moral attributes. Because\nGod’s will is not determined by God’s knowing that an\naction is the best, our certainty that God will do what is best is due\nto our confidence in “the unalterable Rectitude of his\nWill” and not a necessity of his nature (D 86–87, W\n573). In other words, it is a moral necessity and not a metaphysical\nnecessity. A third and related problem is that when God created the\nworld, he did what was best to do, but had a choice among an infinite\nnumber of equally best ways of creating the world because he could\nplace the world anywhere in space and could create it at any time.\nThus, it does not follow from God’s perfect judgment combined\nwith his infinite power to create that God should create the world in\na particular way. Although this bothered Leibniz because it conflicts\nwith his account of the principle of sufficient reason, Clarke fails\nto see any problem (C 4.18–20, W 4.626). \nClarke steadfastly maintained that matter does not have an essential,\naccidental, or super-added power of self-motion. “All things\ndone in the world, are done either immediately by God himself, or by\ncreated intelligent beings: matter being evidently not at all capable\nof any laws or powers whatsoever.” Consequently, the so called\n“effects of the natural powers of matter, and laws of motion; of\ngravitation, attraction, or the like” properly speaking are but\nthe “effects of God’s acting upon matter continually and\nevery moment, either immediately by himself, or mediately by some\ncreated intelligent beings.” Thus, the course of nature is\n“nothing else but the will of God producing certain effects in a\ncontinued, regular, constant and uniform manner which…being in\nevery moment perfectly arbitrary, is as easy to be altered at any\ntime, as to be preserved” (D 149, W 2.698). The laws of nature\nare thus not absolutely necessary but only morally necessary,\ncontinuing as they do only because of the unchanging will of God. (For\nmore on Clarke’s theory of necessity see Yenter 2014, 265–266). \nWith regard to the much contested interpretation of Newton on gravity,\nhe declares that Newton “does not mean to say that attraction is the\ncause of bodies coming together; but by attraction he means to express\nthe effect” (Kassler 2014; 145–146). Leibniz, in his correspondence\nwith Clarke, denies this reading of Newton that makes no metaphysical\ncommitment to gravity as force, suggesting two importantly different\nreadings of Newton (Janiak 2007). While Newton would not speculate\npublicly on metaphysical matters, Clarke argued that this effect could\nnot be the work of body. Rather, God and designated (subordinate,\nintelligent, immaterial) agents, act throughout the world by being\npresent where they act, which is the explanation for gravity and all\nother movements of matter (Brown 2016, 42ff; but see Schliesser 2013,\n44 & 48 for a more modest reading). \nThe claim that matter has not even an accidental power of self-motion\nwas central to Clarke’s attempt to exhibit the manifest activity\nof God in the Newtonian world and refute Spinozism (Schliesser 2012,\n443–449). The claim was radical for the time and elicited many\nresponses. Collins, in a letter to John Trenchard, was angered and\nunimpressed by Clarke’s arguments, which was a common reaction for\nthe growing number of freethinkers (Jacob 1977; 20). Andrew Baxter\n(1733, with an important appendix added in 1750) would later extend\nClarke’s arguments against self-motion, showing that they apply to\nether as well as matter, at a time when ether theories had gained\npopularity as interpretations of Newton and as hypotheses for\nexplaining gravity. \nDespite his insistence on God’s continual activity in the world,\nClarke was not, strictly, an occasionalist. Unlike the occasionalists,\nClarke does not claim that God is the real cause of interactions\nbetween finite minds and matter. Furthermore, matter has a single\n“Negative Power” of staying at rest or continuing\nin motion (W 2.697; Winkler 1989). \nIn response to Henry Dodwell’s argument that the soul is\nnaturally mortal but is made immortal by God only at a baptism\nperformed by someone properly ordained, Clarke wrote an open letter\ndefending the soul’s “natural” immortality on the\nbasis that the soul cannot be material, because what is material is\ndivisible, and what is divisible cannot be the source of the unity of\nconsciousness. (He assumes throughout that if the soul is immaterial\nthen it is immortal.) In response, the freethinker Anthony Collins\ndefended the position that consciousness can be an emergent property\nof matter, opening the door for a materialist theory of mind. Although\nhe opposed the natural mortality of the soul, Clarke thinks that God\ndestroys the souls of all the persons that are not admitted to heaven,\nso there is no hell of eternal suffering, perhaps justifying calling\nhim a “mortalist” (Wigelsworth 2009; 58ff). Clarke clearly\nendorsed the following: all souls survive bodily death; the soul\nremains in a state of (literal or metaphorical) sleep until the final\njudgment; the souls of sinners are destroyed at the final judgment.\n(See especially Obligations 179–180 of 1706 edition; sermon preached\nOct 11 1709; Whiston 1730, 146; Sermon CXXI, 2.38–39; Snobelen 2004,\n275–284). \nLoosely following Locke’s distinctions, Clarke argues that there\nare three kinds of properties: those that inhere in the substance\n(real properties), those that are commonly but improperly believed to\nreside in the substance (secondary qualities), and “merely\nabstract names to express the effects” of material\nsubstances or systems (CC 56–58). The third category includes\nmagnetism and gravity, which are properly descriptions of a different\nsubstance (in this case, divine activity and not matter). The second\ncategory are the traditional secondary qualities; the discussed\nexample is the smell of a rose. Consciousness falls in the first\ncategory, but, unlike the other members of that category such as\nmagnitude and figure, it does not divide or sum. \nEmploying what Kant (1781, A351) famously dubbed the “Achilles\nargument,” Clarke claims that the essential unity of\nconsciousness is incompatible with the divisibility and composability\nof matter, because the consciousness must be distributed among the\nvarious component parts, rendering each part conscious. Clarke is not\nclear on what exactly it is about consciousness that requires this\nunity (Rozemond 2003, 175–177). Officially, consciousness is a\nreflexive act in which I recognize my thoughts as my own and is\ntherefore prior to memory, although Clarke sometimes writes\n“consciousness” when he seems to mean “memory”\n(Thiel 2011, 231). \nClarke’s version of the Achilles argument rests on two\nprinciples. The Homogeneity Principle says that “a power can\nreally inhere in a composite only if it is of the same kind as the\npowers of the parts” (Vailati 1993, 395). Strictly, the\nHomogeneity Principle only applies to the first category of qualities\n(Rozemond 2009, 180). The Composition Principle says that “the\nproperties of the parts will sum to the same properties of the whole\n(and that the properties of the whole can be divided into the\nparts)” (Uzgalis 2011, 23). William Uzgalis finds versions of\nthe Homogeneity Principle in Cudworth and Bayle, and in all three\ncases it is used to argue that thought or consciousness cannot arise\nfrom motion or figure because they are not of the same kind. A less\noften discussed variation on Clarke’s core argument (but see\nRozemond 2003, 182ff) is that “figure, divisibility, mobility\nand other such like qualities of matter” cannot produce\nconscious thought (a real power) because they are “not real,\nproper, distinct, and positive powers, but only negative qualities,\ndeficiencies, and imperfections,” which appeals to the principle\nthat there can be no perfection or power in the effect that is not in\nthe cause (D 41, W 2.545). \nThe enduring soul serves as Clarke’s explanation for personal\nidentity. Collins, following Locke, argued for a memory theory of\npersonal identity. Clarke’s original attack on Collins claims\nthat God could put one person’s memories into multiple people;\nthey would be distinct people but each would be identical to the\noriginal person, so identity is not transitive. Although\nClarke’s argument became popular in the eighteenth century\n(Barresi and Martin 2004, 33–49), it seems to have been\nforgotten then reintroduced in the 1950s (Uzgalis 33, citing Flew\n1951, Prior 1957, and Williams 1957). Collins pointed out that\nClarke’s theory faces an unpleasant dilemma, in that either animals\n(who do exhibit self-motion) do not think or have experiences\n(implausible) or God has to deal with an animal’s soul (animal\nheaven? annihilation?) (Garrett 2013, 181). \nClarke’s claim that the unity of consciousness is incompatible\nwith divisible matter is complicated by his apparent belief that souls\nare extended. At least, he refused to rule out the possibility that\nsouls are extended because “as the parts of space or expansion\nitself can demonstrably be proved to be absolutely\nindiscerptible [indivisible], so it ought not to be reckoned an\ninsuperable difficulty to imagine that all immaterial thinking\nsubstances (upon supposition that expansion is not excluded out\nof their idea) may be so likewise” (CC 62, W 3.763). The issue,\nas Clarke tries to frame it, is not that consciousness is incompatible\nwith extension but that it is incompatible with anything divisible\ninto parts. Because, following Newton, Clarke denies that space is\nactually divisible into parts, it cannot be ruled out that the soul is\nextended. His acceptance of the principle that there is no action at a\ndistance and of the claim that immaterial beings (both finite and God)\nact in space perhaps push him to accept that the soul is extended. If\nso, he does not provide details, for instance, whether the soul\noccupies the same space as the whole body, the brain, or some part of\nthe brain, or how souls move from place to place if not affected by\nbodies. Richard Price, defending Clarke, and Joseph Priestley both\nread Clarke as accepting extended souls. Priestley objects that souls\nmust therefore have shape (which he takes to be implausible) and must\ninterpenetrate God’s spiritual substance (which he takes to be\nimpossible, as in the case of physical substances) (Price and\nPriestley 1777, 58–62). \nThis section reviews Clarke’s key arguments in philosophy of\nreligion and philosophical theology. The topic of divine freedom was\ncovered in the earlier section on free will, as well as in \nthe entry on \n  divine freedom. \nClarke also wrote on topics such as divine attributes, baptism, the\nhistoricity of disputed New Testament writings, and the veracity of\nvarious Christian doctrines, which are not discussed here. \nClarke thought highly of the argument from design, largely because it\nis widely accessible and easily grasped. However, due to the rise of\natheistic systems of philosophy, he thought it was necessary to give\nan argument that would satisfy his fellow metaphysicians, such as the\nfollowing, presented in his first set of Boyle lectures. The Boyle\nlectures, especially Clarke’s were crucial to spreading\nNewton’s views. As Margaret Jacob (1977, 2) has convincingly\nargued, “Without these sermons, Newton’s system of the\nworld would have remained relatively unknown, and possibly even\nfeared, by an educated and literate public on both sides of the\nChannel which could not have begun to understand the mathematical\nintricacies of the Principia.” \nClarke tells us that his argument for the being and attributes of God\nwas done “partly by metaphysical Reasoning, and partly from\nthe Discoveries (principally those that have been lately made) in\nNatural Philosophy” (W 2.581). His argument, which was\nknown in Clarke’s time as “the argument a\npriori,” occupies most of A Demonstration of the Being\nand Attributes of God, Clarke’s first set of Boyle\nLectures. (Note that Clarke’s use of the term “a\npriori” is not that which has been standard since Kant. The\nargument is a priori not primarily because it is available\nindependent of experience, but because it argues from the nature of\nthe cause to the nature of the effect; this is in contrast with the\nargument a posteriori which works from the effects —\ne.g., the design of the world— to the cause — e.g., the\ndesigner.) The argument is typically classified today as cosmological,\nbut it should not be confused with the kalam cosmological\nargument (which takes as a premise that the world has a finite\nhistory). Clarke’s version belongs to the tradition of modal\ncosmological arguments that employ the principle of sufficient reason\nto argue from a contingent series of causes to a necessary being. The\nmain lines of Clarke’s “argument a priori”\nare as\n follows.[1] \nSomething now exists, so something always was (D 8, W 2.524).\nOtherwise nothing would exist now because it is impossible for\nsomething to be produced by nothing. Clarke does not explicitly\nacknowledge that “something always was” is ambiguous\nbetween a stronger, de re reading and a weaker, de\ndicto reading. Because the stronger, de re claim (this\nparticular thing has always existed) seems unwarranted by the argument\nthus far and the next step of the argument is to establish that there\nis a single independent being, the more plausible and weaker de\ndicto claim (some thing or another, perhaps a succession of\nvarious things, has always existed) can be assumed. \nWhat has existed from eternity can only be either an independent being\n(one having in itself the reason of its existence) or an infinite\nseries of dependent beings. However, such an infinite series cannot be\nwhat has existed from eternity because by hypothesis it can have no\nexternal cause, and no internal cause (no dependent being in the\nseries) can cause the whole series. Hence, an independent being\nexists. A frequent objection to this argument is that the demand for\nan explanation is satisfied when it is conceded that each being in the\nseries has a cause (Rowe 1971, 56–57). The series is not a new entity\nto be explained, so there is no reason to appeal to an eternal,\nindependent being. Furthermore, if the series is not dependent, then\nit is not contingent, and if it is not contingent, then it is\nnecessary. Clarke finds this options unacceptable, as have many since\n(including Rowe 1973, 57–59, and van Inwagen 2014, 159–182), but\nClarke’s appeal to God’s will to maintain the contingency of the\ncreated world has been challenged, especially by Leibniz (see 3.2,\nabove). \nThis independent being is “self-existent, that is, necessarily\nexisting” (D 12, W 2.527), a conclusion he also reaches by\narguing that space and time cannot be conceived not to exist and they\nare obviously not self-existent, so the substance on which they\ndepend, God, must exist necessarily as well (D 13, W 2.527–528).\n(Clarke was criticized for assuming, rather than arguing, that space\nand time are attributes of God.) It seems that for Clarke a\n“necessary being” is a being whose non-existence is\nimpossible (either because it is an independent being or is\nnecessarily dependent on an independent being), and a\n“self-existent being” is a being whose non-existence is\nimpossible because the necessity of its existence is to be found in\nits own nature. Once these two are distinguished, however, Clarke is\nopen to the criticism that he cannot rule out the existence of two\nself-existent beings (as he attempts in the seventh proposition)\nbecause there may be two beings who are self-existent even though only\none self-existent being is required to explain the existence of the\nworld (Law 1758, 21). Anthony Atkey (1725, 3–14) provided a\nvariation on this objection in correspondence. He alleges that Clarke\nillegitimately moves from the existence of at least one\n“necessary being” to the existence of no more than one\n“self-existent being.” Clarke concludes that there\nexists only one self-existent being, but he has at best shown\nthat we cannot have the idea of two self-existent beings.\nAtkey’s objection is about the relationship of the conceivable\nto the possible. Clarke’s response (Atkey 1725, 17–19) is\nthat we have clear ideas in this case, so our ideas can guide us in\nthe nature of things (conceivability entails possibility in the case\nof clear ideas), but he does not give any reason why we should think\nour ideas are clear in this case. This problem is exacerbated by his\ndenial that we have adequate ideas of the essences of substances,\nincluding God. If we do not have adequate ideas of any substances\n(including the divine being) then how could we have a clear idea of\nGod? Roger North had previously raised a similar worry about Clarke\nneeding to show “natural things accord with our ideas,”\nbut Clarke’s response has not survived (NC 133). \nIf successful, Clarke’s argument a priori establishes\nall the metaphysical attributes of God (independence, eternality,\nimmutability, infinitude, omnipresence) by examining the nature of\nnecessity and positing the contingency of the world. To reach the\npersonal and moral attributes of God, it is necessary to draw upon\nfurther features of the world and argue a posteriori (D 38, W\n2.543). Clarke attempted a variety of arguments to establish that God\nis an agent (that is, that God is not only intelligent but has a will\nthat is free in a libertarian sense). First, one real feature of the\nworld is that there are intelligent beings in it. Intelligence, being\na perfection, must exist to at least as great a degree in the cause as\nin the effect (an instance of Clarke’s applying a causal version\nof the principle of sufficient reason). So God must be intelligent\n(D38–39, W 4.543). Second, this intelligence can be established\nfrom the order and beauty of the world, so a teleological argument can\nreach this conclusion as well. Third, Clarke claimed that\n“intelligence without liberty … is really (in respect of\nany power, excellence, or perfection) no intelligence at all,”\nso therefore God must be an agent. Fourth, the person positing a God\nwithout freedom (Clarke specifically mentions Spinoza) is positing a\ncontradiction and has failed to explain the source of activity in the\nworld (D 46–47, W 4.548–549). Finally, the necessitarian\n(like Spinoza) is forced to deny a number of (to Clarke) obvious\npoints, including that things could be different than they are, that\nthere are final causes in the universe, and that there is a variety of\nfinite things in the universe (Yenter 2014). \nWith God’s intelligence and agency in place, he sketches how\nGod’s wisdom, goodness, justice, and other moral perfections can\nbe established. \nAccording to traditional Christian theology, God is eternal and\nomnipresent. Clarke accepted both, but his attempts to explain what\nthose claims mean are not always clear. Four central tenets of\nClarke’s position are unpacked below. \nGod is able to act at all times and in all places because he\nis substantially present in all times and in all places. To\ndeny this would entail accepting action at a distance, which Clarke,\nlike most of his contemporaries, found mysterious or impossible (Brown\n2016). \nGod’s substantial presence entails that the Scholastic view\nof divine eternity and immensity is false. Clarke rejected the\nview of God as substantially removed from space and time. Divine\neternity involves both necessary existence and infinite duration\nwhich, however, could not be identified with the traditional notion of\nthe eternal present (nunc stans) according to which God\nexists in an unchanging permanent present without any successive\nduration. He considered such a view unintelligible at best and\ncontradictory at worst (CC 107, W 3.794). The attribution of\nsuccessive duration to God might suggest that God, like us, is in time\nbut, unlike us, does not change. However, this was not Clarke’s\nview. In his exchanges with Butler he clarifies that God is not\ntechnically in space and time, because God is prior (in the order of\nnature) to time whereas things in time are metaphysically subsequent\nto the existence of time. Moreover, he attributed distinct and\nsuccessive thoughts to God; otherwise God could not “vary his\nwill, nor diversify his works, nor act successively, nor govern the\nworld, nor indeed have any power to will or do anything at all”\n(W 3.897). Hence, God is immutable with respect to his will only in\nthe sense that he does not change his mind. \nGod is not identical to space or time; although necessary, they\ndepend for their existence upon God. Clarke’s earliest\nreported philosophical idea, years before he read Newton, is that God\ncannot destroy space (Whiston 1730, 22–23). A common worry about\nabsolute space in the eighteenth century was that if space is\ninfinite, necessary, and indestructible then either God is not the\nonly infinite, necessary, and independent being or God is identical to\nspace, both of which were theologically unorthodox. Clarke’s\nposition in the Demonstration, the letters to Butler, and the\nletter to an anonymous author (almost certainly Daniel Waterland) is\nthat space and time are divine attributes or properties, a view he may\nhave found in Henry More (Thomas 2015, 18). Because they depend on the\nonly self-subsisting being, they are not independent beings (D\n122–123, W 4.758). He told Leibniz that immensity and eternality\nare “an immediate and necessary consequence” of\nGod’s existence, without supplying any further argument or\nexplaining the relationship between “consequence,”\n“mode,” “attribute,” and\n“property.” Many have understood Clarke to mean that God\nis literally dimensional. Clarke’s early critic Anthony Collins\n(1713, 47–48) read him this way. Emily Thomas (2018, 172–176)\nhas recently provided strong evidence that Clarke’s views undergo a\nchange after 1719; from this point on Clarke is careful to say that\nimmensity and eternality are “modes of existence” rather\nthan attributes, where modes of existence can be ascribed to God\nand to God’s attributes, whereas an attribute cannot be\nascribed to any other attribute. For example, God is eternal and\nGod’s intelligence is eternal, but God’s will is not\nintelligent, so intelligence is an attribute but eternality is a mode\nof existence. \nGod’s immensity and eternality are consistent with\nGod’s unity. As Leibniz and Waterland noted, the\nidentification of divine immensity with space endangers the simplicity\nof the divine being because space has parts, albeit not separable\nones. The objection, though formidable, was not new; Bayle in the\nDictionnaire (entry “Leucippus,” remark G) had\nchided the Newtonians for identifying space with divine immensity in\norder to solve the ontological problem created by the positing of an\ninfinite space because it leads to the destruction of divine\nsimplicity and to various absurdities. As a further point, Waterland\nsuggests that since Clarke accepts that nothing with parts can be the\nsubject of consciousness, God’s immensity also undermines divine\nintelligence and consciousness. Clarke offered two responses. Firstly,\nnot everything extended has parts. Space is extended, but (as Newton\nhad claimed) its “parts” cannot be moved, so they are not\ntruly parts. Secondly, Clarke claimed parity between spatial and\ntemporal extendedness: because the former is compatible with the\nsimplicity of what “stretches” temporally, the latter is\ncompatible with the simplicity of what stretches spatially. But the\nparity between space and time, were it to be granted, rather than\nshowing that spatial extendedness is not detrimental to a\nthing’s simplicity because temporal extendedness is not, could\nbe taken to show that the latter is detrimental to a thing’s\nsimplicity because the former is. \nIn his lifetime, Clarke was infamous for his view of the trinity, and\nhe sparked a vociferous debate (Ferguson 1974, 59–149;\nPfizenmaier 1997, 179–216). Clarke was not officially censured\n(but nearly so), but it surely prevented his rising to higher office.\nClarke’s writing on the trinity are relevant for understanding\nhis other metaphysical positions, especially his identification of\n“person” with intelligent, acting agent rather than with a\nparticular substance, which has not been sufficiently reconciled with\nhis account of personal identity as wrapped up with an immaterial\nsoul. \nIn Christian theology, God is represented as tripartite—three\npersons but one God. In the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, in\nuse in England during Clarke’s lifetime, one of the liturgies\ndraws from the Athanasian Creed, which includes the following\ndiscussion of the Trinity: “For there is one Person of the\nFather, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghost. But the\nGodhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all\none… So the Father is God, the Son is God : and the Holy Ghost\nis God. And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.” In his\nposition as a cleric, Clarke was required to subscribe to this\nformulation. In 1712, against the advice of his friends, he published\nThe Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity, in which he diverged\nfrom what his opponents considered the plain sense of this\nformulation. The Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity begins by\ncollecting all the passages of the New Testament that relate to the\nTrinity. It then sets out a series of 55 propositions regarding the\nTrinity, each supported by references to the texts collected in the\nfirst section and writings from the early Christian church. However,\nthe biblical texts do not primarily discuss God’s metaphysical\nattributes, according to Clarke, but ascribe dominion to God (W 4.150;\nSnobelen 2004, 265–275). The third section relates these propositions\nto the Anglican liturgy. This approach reflects Clarke’s general\nexpectation that the correct theological doctrines are found in the\nBible, are endorsed by the early church, and are compatible with\nreason. Through hundreds of years of what he considered bad\nmetaphysics, the correct and intelligible doctrine of the trinity had\nbecome obscured, and Clarke hoped to return to a pre-Athanasian\nunderstanding of the trinity. \nClarke’s position in The Scripture-Doctrine of the\nTrinity was labeled by his opponents as “Arian,”\n“Socinian,” and “Sabellian.” Although they\nwere commonly used as abusive terms for anyone holding non-traditional\nor anti-trinitarian views, they also have more precise meanings. An\nArian holds that the Son (the second person of the Trinity) is divine\nbut not eternal; he was created by God the Father out of nothing\nbefore the beginning of the world. A Socinian holds that the Son is\nmerely human and was created at or after the conception of Jesus. A\nSabellian holds that the Son is a mode of God. In the precise use of\nthe terms, Clarke is none of these. Unlike the Arians, Clarke affirmed\nthat the Son is co-eternal with the Father and not created (W 4.141).\n(Pfizenmaier 1997 provides further textual and historical arguments\nthat Clarke should not be classified as an Arian.) From this it also\nfollows that, contra the Socinians, the Son existed before\nthe conception of Jesus. Unlike the Sabellians, Clarke denied that the\nSon was a mode of the Father. (This would have been very problematic\ngiven that he sometimes claimed that space is a mode of God.)\nClarke’s claimed ignorance about substance made him reluctant to\ndeclare that the Father and the Son were the same divine substance,\nbut the Son is endowed by the Father with all of the power and\nauthority of the Father. He also called the manner of the Son’s\ngeneration from the father “ineffable.” So while Clarke\ndenied that the trinity was a “mystery,” he did believe\nthat the manner in which the Father’s power is communicated to the\nSon is “after a manner to us unknown” (Proposition 35;\n4.159). \nClarke affirms that each member of the trinity is a person, but only\nthe Father is self-existent, which means that the Father by essence\n(rather than by “office”) has a property that the Son does\nnot. His views are best described as subordinationist but he could\nalso be called a unitarian, in at least some senses of the term (Tuggy\n2014; 204–205). See especially Prop. 25 (W 4.150); Prop. 27 (W 4.151);\nand Prop. 34 (“The Son, whatever his metaphysical essence of\nsubstance be, and whatever divine greatness and dignity is ascribed to\nhim in scripture; yet in this he is evidently subordinate to the\nFather, that he derives his being, attributes, and powers, from the\nFather, and the Father nothing from him”; 4.155). To the Father\nalone are ascribed “independence and supreme authority”\n(Proposition 27; 4.151). Every other attribute and power that can be\nascribed to the Father can also be ascribed to the Son, “but the\ntitles ascribed to the Son, must always carry along with them the idea\nof being communicated or derived” (4.153). \nLike many associated with the Royal Society, Clarke thought that\nmiracles could be used as evidence for the claim that Christianity is\nthe true religion. However, given that matter is inactive, God is\nactively involved in all or nearly all events in the world. What then\ncould separate out a particular action of God as miraculous? According\nto Clarke, a miracle is a “work effected in a manner\nunusual, or different from the common and regular Method of\nProvidence, by the interposition either of God himself, or of some\nIntelligent Agent superior to Man, for the Proof or Evidence of some\nparticular Doctrine, or in attestation to the Authority of some\nparticular Person” (W 2.701). \nMiracles became a point of controversy in the letters that passed\nbetween Clarke and Leibniz (W 4.605). One focus of the debate is which\nwould be greater: a world so perfectly crafted that God does not need\nto intervene to keep it running (Leibniz), or a world so dependent on\nGod that one cannot understand the world without recognizing its\ncontinual dependence on the operations of God (Clarke). A second focus\nof the debate is the proper understanding of a miracle: something that\nexceeds the natural power of created things (Leibniz), or something\nthat seems different from our human expectation of how things operate\n(Clarke). \nClarke maintains that miracles are miraculous only from a human\nperspective and that God actively and continuously works in the\nphysical world because matter is completely passive. Since God’s\nwisdom and goodness are unchanging, if God chooses to act differently\nin the world at a certain time (e.g., by changing the laws of motion),\nit is only because it was always good to do so and was part of\nGod’s plan from eternity. Because it requires no more power for\nGod to do the miraculous-to-us as to do the natural-to-us, neither one\nis “with Respect to God, more or less Natural\nor Supernatural than the other.” From our perspective,\nGod is changing the order of things; from God’s perspective,\neverything is equally a part of God’s design. A miracle, then,\nis only a miracle “with Regard to our\nConceptions” (C2.6–12, W 4.598–601). In his\nfinal letter Clarke elaborates on this, suggesting that we call\nthe sun stopping in the sky miraculous only because it is unusual; if it\nwas always at the same point in the sky, then that would be natural,\nand its motion miraculous. Similarly, raising a dead body from the\nground is miraculous, but only because God does not usually act that\nway (C5.107–109, W 4.693; C3.17, W 4.611–612). Unusualness\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition for being a miracle\n(C4.43, W 4.629–630), but Clarke nowhere says what else is\nrequired. \nLeibniz attacks Clarke’s position from multiple angles.\nLeibniz’s first letter accuses Newton of making an imperfect\nmachine that requires tuning to keep it running, like a watch that\nrequires winding, but this is unfitting a perfect God. In\nNewton’s world, miracles are required “in order to supply\nthe Wants of Nature” (L1.4, W 4.588). Clarke responds that there\nis a disanalogy between the watch and the world. The watch requires\nwinding because a human watchmaker can only compose parts and put them\nin motion, whereas God is both the creator and preserver of forces and\npowers. On the offensive, Clarke charges those who deny God’s\nconstant involvement in the world to be allowing a mechanical world, a\nworld of “Materialism and Fate,” where\nGod is not needed at all (C1.4, W 4.590). In response, Leibniz makes\nthe interesting objection that either Clarke is explaining natural\nthings by the supernatural, which is absurd, or else God is a part of\nnature (specifically, the soul of the world) (L2.12, W 4.596;\nL4.110–11, W 4.666). Leibniz also charges that Clarke cannot\nexplain the difference between natural and supernatural action.\n“But it is regular, (says the Author,) it is\nconstant, and consequently natural. I answer; it\ncannot be regular, without being reasonable; nor natural, unless it\ncan be explained by the Natures of creatures” (L5.121, W\n4.668–669). Regularities require explanations, and to be natural\nthese explanations must come from the natures of the creatures. The\nClarkean picture, in which matter is completely passive, is incapable\nof explaining the regularities exhibited in the interaction of\nmaterial bodies in terms of those bodies. Whereas Clarke saw this as\nthe pinnacle of what natural philosophy contributes to natural\ntheology, Leibniz saw it as a failure to exhibit a fully rational\nworld suited to being created by a perfectly good God. \nClarke is very confident in the prospects of general revelation; that\nis, he thinks that human reason is capable of discovering the\nexistence and attributes of God by reasoning from the evidence of\nnature. Indeed, Clarke believes that Christianity presupposes natural\nreligion (W 4.582). Many theological and ethical truths (e.g., there\nis a God, God is to be worshiped, it is good to be just and righteous)\nare plainly understandable to everyone, and if one is mistaken in\nthese matters “’tis not by his Understanding, but\nby his Will that he is deceived.” Yet it is very common\nto oppose these truths; the most common causes are “a\npresumptuous Ignorance, which despises\nKnowledge”; carelessness, which leads to blindly following local\ncustoms; prejudice, which is relying implicitly on others and\ntraditions rather than an examination of the evidence; and vice, a\nwillful opposition to the truth due to the love of wickedness,\ndebauchery, and power (W 2.147–160). The reasoned defense of\nnatural religion, although perhaps unable to sway the prejudiced, was\ncentral to Clarke’s project. \nClarke thought deists could be convinced to abandon their position\nbecause deism is unstable. In Clarke’s taxonomy, there are four\ncategories of deists (W 2.600ff). The first category of deist say they\nbelieve in “an Eternal, Infinite, Independent, Intelligent\nBeing” that made the world, but this God is not involved in the\ngoverning of the world nor does God care for what happens in it. In\nresponse, Clarke argues (1) that the best science of the day has shown\nthat the nature of matter is insufficient to ground the laws by which\nmatter acts and thus requires the continuous dependence upon its\nCreator, and (2) a God that isn’t concerned for what happens in\nthe world must be lacking in knowledge of what is happening, power to\naffect what is happening, ability to act in the world, or wisdom to\nknow that intervention is needed, and thus is not the God that the\ndeist claimed to accept. The second category accept providential\naction in the world, but deny that God has moral attributes; ethics is\na matter of human construction. They fail to see, thinks Clarke, (1)\nthat ethics is a matter of eternal, fixed relations and (2) that to\ndeny the moral attributes of God entails the denial of either\nGod’s wisdom or power. The third group of deists affirm\nGod’s moral attributes, but they deny the immortality of the\nhuman soul and that moral terms apply univocally between God and\nhumans, which in practice leads to the denial of a future state after\ndeath. Clarke claims that this explodes all the attributes of God so\nthat we no longer know what we are saying when we talk about God.\nFinally, some deists hold all the right theological and ethical\ndoctrines, but claim that they know this solely on the basis of\ngeneral revelation and thus have no need of a special, Christian\nrevelation. Clarke suspects that this fourth category of deists no\nlonger exist in lands where Christianity has reached. \nAlthough some of his sermons contain interesting analyses of\nindividual Christian virtues, the most sustained exposition of\nClarke’s deontological, rationalist ethics is contained in his\nsecond set of Boyle Lectures, A Discourse Concerning the\nUnalterable Obligations of Natural Religion. Clarke begins by\nstating that clearly there are different relations among persons and\nthat from these relations there arise a “fitness” or\n“unfitness” of behavior among persons. So, for example,\ngiven the relation of infinite disproportion between humans and God,\nit is fit that we honor, worship, and imitate God. These facts can be\nrationally apprehended by anyone with a sound mind, although in some\ncases we may be at a loss in clearly demarcating right from wrong.\nBeing grounded in necessary relations, ethical truths, like\ngeometrical truths, are universal and necessary. As such, they are\nindependent of any will, divine or human, and of any consideration of\npunishment or reward. \nIn somewhat more detail, the central tenets of Clarke’s ethics\nare elucidated in the subordinate components of the first proposition\nof A Discourse. \nFrom (3) and in clarification of sobriety and piety in (4), Clarke\nargues the ideal (created) moral agent is one who acts within the\nscope of what God, with full authority and compatibly with reason, has\ncommanded. For instance, we ought to preserve our own being because\nGod has created us and sustains us and only God ought to remove us\nfrom the world (Heydt 2018, 135). Regarding (4), Clarke argues that\nduties toward others are governed by equity, which demands that one\ndeal with other persons as one can reasonably expect others to deal\nwith one (W 2.619), and by love, which demands that one further the\nwell-being happiness of all persons (W 2.621). Duties towards oneself\ndemand that one preserve one’s physical health, mental\nfaculties, and spiritual well-being so as to be able to perform\none’s duties (W 2.623). Clarke uses (5) as an opportunity to\ndevelop a series of interesting attacks on Hobbes’ account of\npolitical and moral obligation. Among his many criticisms, he argues\nthat a social contract cannot be obligatory unless there were already\nan obligation to obey contracts; if a contract benefits the community\nthen there are real benefits prior to the contract so the contract\ndoes not generate benefits and harms; it is a contradiction for\neveryone to have a right to the same thing in the state of nature; and\nif power is to be obeyed then an all-powerful devil should be obeyed,\nwhich is absurd (W 2.609–616, 631–638). \nIn clarification of (6), Clarke adds that because God always does what\nis just and good, God’s commands align with the eternal law (W\n2.637), and that because God wants to make us happy and good, God\npromotes the goodness and welfare of the whole of creation, including\nus (W 2.640). While the law is antecedent to considerations of reward\nand punishment (7), God’s justice ensures the proper rewards and\npunishments for following the law (W 2.641). These sanctions are not\nuniformly present in this life, so the reward and punishment must (at\nleast partly) occur in the next life. Moreover, human depravity makes\nthe prospect of future sanctions a necessary incentive for proper\nbehavior. God might also ensure that our acting from the best reasons\ndoes not have overall much worse consequences (Schneewind 1997,\n317). \nClarke’s theory has been roundly criticized on several grounds,\nespecially on the meaning and sufficiency of (1). He never adequately\nexplained the nature of the relations among persons that ground\nmorality. For instance, his explanation for why it is\n“fit” to honor, worship, obey, and imitate God is that\n“God is infinitely superior to Men” (W\n2.608). If the infinite superiority is in reference to power or being,\nit is not obviously to the point; if it is an expression of an ethical\nrelation, the argument is circular. Additionally, it is unclear what\nin the “Nature and Reason of Things” is necessary. Is it\nthat good is necessarily not evil? (This is trivial and unhelpful.) Is\nit that one thing cannot be both good from one perspective and evil\nfrom another? (In which case, Clarke is offering a response to Hobbes\nor maybe Spinoza, but he doesn’t provide a substantial\nalternative.) Is it that whatever is good is necessarily good? (In\nwhich case, he is perhaps restating his opposition to divine command\ntheory, but again not in a way that makes clear his alternative.) Is\nit something else? Clarke’s position is not clear, but he does\nseem to affirm each of these interpretations at different times. A\nfurther structural problem is that Clarke slides between the claim\nthat ethical truths are relations between mind-independent objects in\nthe world, and that they are grounded in the nature of rationality\nitself, apparently without distinguishing the two positions.\nRelatedly, there is an interpretive question about whether Clarke is\nontologically committed to the existence of mind-independent values\nthat are not reducible to anything in the world (Kelly 2002). Finally,\neven if these relations exist, it is not clear how moral obligation\narises from such relations. Hume (1739, 3.1.1.3–7) famously\ncharged theories like Clarke’s with motivational impotence\nbecause the perception of “fitness” cannot, by itself,\nmove the will. However, as we saw, Clarke denied that evaluation\ncauses motivation, although he clearly thought that evaluation\nprovides the agent, who ultimately causes the volition, with reasons\nfor action. \nClarke’s influence on his contemporaries and the generation that\nfollowed was immense. One important aspect of his immediate influence\nwas that as the translator of the standard textbook in physics in\nEngland in the early eighteenth century, as the defender of absolute\nspace and atomism in the correspondence with Leibniz, as the\ntranslator of Newton’s Opticks into Latin, and as a\nrecognized close friend of Newton, Clarke was perhaps the most\nsignificant spokesperson for the Newtonian natural philosophy, and a\nprimary interpreter of its implications for metaphysics, philosophy of\nscience, and theology. In particular, his use of the passivity and\nscarcity of matter in his argument for the existence of God was noted\nby his contemporaries internationally. \nClarke’s influence was greatest in England and Scotland, where\nall of his works were widely read. (Although his Boyle lectures went\nthrough ten editions in thirty years, Dahm [1970, 176] finds only one\ntranslation during that time, into French.) Daniel Waterland was his\nsharpest contemporary critic, but the two remained friendly throughout\n(Ferguson 1976, 217). A. A. Sykes and John Jackson were Clarke’s\nmost forceful defenders in the 1710s and 1720s. Clarke often made\nsuggestions to Jackson about how best to defend his views (Ferguson\n1976, 218–219). Among those sympathetic to Clarke’s methodology\nand positions in the next two generations, Andrew Baxter was the most\npolemical, John Stewart the most irritating to Hume, Richard Price the\nmost similar, and Thomas Reid the most well known today.\nClarke’s ethics (with some metaphysical support) were defended\nby William Wollaston and Catharine Trotter Cockburn (see Thomas 2017,\n210ff), supplemented by Joseph Butler, and attacked by David Hume (see\nGreenberg 2013, 251ff). \nHume clearly has Clarke in mind in his Dialogues Concerning\nNatural Religion, where Demea recites the argument a\npriori and both Cleanthes and Philo offer critiques. Furthermore,\nClarke is cited by name in Treatise 1.3.3 and is a likely\nobject of the arguments against ethical rationalism in\nTreatise 3.1. In A Letter from a Gentleman (1745),\nHume admits that Clarke’s argument a priori is\nundermined by the claims of the Treatise. Russell (1997 and\n2008) has proposed that Clarke is a major target of Hume’s\nTreatise, and that Hume’s opposition to natural\ntheology as defended by Clarke is a uniting theme of the\nTreatise. \nClarke profoundly influenced philosophers in the eighteenth century\nthat had interests in the intersection of theology and philosophy,\nparticularly on the freedom of the will and the relationship between\nGod, space, and matter. Jonathan Edwards singled out Clarke as a major\nopponent in his Freedom of the Will, where Edwards runs\ntogether libertarianism with Arminian theology. That same\nlibertarianism made Clarke popular among the German Pietists. Among\nthem, Crusius is the most notable, both for his work and for his\nimportance to Kant, and the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence is a likely\nsource for Kant’s discussions of space and time. Voltaire (1752)\ndeclared, “Among these philosophers [the last generation of\nBritish philosophers], Clarke is perhaps altogether the clearest, the\nmost profound, the most methodical, and the strongest of all those who\nhave spoken of the Supreme Being.” Voltaire as a young man was\nparticularly impressed with Clarke; later in life, he seems to have\nbeen less convinced by Clarke’s argument for the existence of\nGod. In Emile, Rousseau refers to “the illustrious\nClarke enlightening the world, proclaiming at last the Being of beings\nand the Dispenser of things,” but whether Rousseau was\nsteadfastly sympathetic to Clarke’s system is in doubt (Attfield\n2004, 433–434). \nClarke’s influence waned late in the eighteenth century. In\n1778, Richard Price could still write on behalf of many that\n“Dr. Clarke is, without all doubt, the best and ablest of all\nwriters, on the subjects of the Immateriality and Natural Immortality\nof the Soul, and also on Liberty and Necessity,” but by the\nnineteenth century interest in and appreciation of Clarke had\ndwindled. Samuel Coleridge (1854, 405) considered him\n“over-rated,” and Leslie Stephen (1881, 119) claimed that\nto nineteenth-century eyes, Clarke “appears to be a second-rate\nadvocate of opinions interesting only in the mouths of greater men who\nwere their first and ablest advocates.” Henry Sidgwick (1886,\n175–180), despite his criticisms, is a nineteenth-century exception in\nholding Clarke in high regard. \nIn the last few decades, a renewed interest in Clarke’s argument\na priori, a rediscovery of Newton’s unpublished writings\nand subsequent study of his associates, and a greater appreciation for\nClarke’s historical importance to ethics, metaphysics, and more have\nphilosophers reading Clarke again, and the estimation of his\nphilosophical acuity has increased.","contact.mail":"tpyenter@olemiss.edu","contact.domain":"olemiss.edu"}]
