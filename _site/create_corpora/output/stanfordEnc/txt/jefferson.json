Andrew Holowchak","entry":"jefferson","body.text":"\n\n\nScholars in general have not taken seriously Thomas Jefferson\n(1743–1826) as a philosopher, perhaps because he never wrote a\nformal philosophical treatise. Yet Jefferson was a prodigious writer,\nand his writings were suffuse with philosophical content.\nWell-acquainted with the philosophical literature of his day and of\nantiquity, he left behind a rich philosophical legacy in his\ndeclarations, presidential messages and addresses, public papers,\nnumerous bills, letters to philosophically minded correspondents, and\nhis only book, Notes on the State of Virginia. Scrutiny of\nthose writings reveals a refined political philosophy as well as a\nsystemic approach to a philosophy of education in partnership with it.\nJefferson’s political philosophy and his views on education were\nundergirded and guided by a consistent and progressive vision of\nhumans, their place in the cosmos, and the good life that owed much to\nancient philosophers like Epictetus, Antoninus, and Cicero; to the\nethical precepts of Jesus; to coetaneous Scottish empiricists like\nFrancis Hutcheson and Lord Kames; and even to esteemed religionists\nand philosophically inclined literary figures of the period like\nLaurence Sterne, Jean Baptiste Massillon, and Miguel Cervantes. In one\narea, however, he was behindhand: his views on race, the subject of\nthe final section.\n\nFrom 1752 to 1757, Jefferson studied under the Scottish clergyman,\nRev. William Douglas, “a superficial Latinist” and\n“less instructed in Greek,” from whom he learned French\nand the rudiments of Latin and Greek. With the death of his father in\n1757, Jefferson earned a substantial inheritance—some\n£2,400 and some 5,000 acres of land to be divided between him\nand younger brother, Randolph—and then began to study under Rev.\nJames Maury, “a correct classical scholar” ([Au], p.\n4). \nFrom 1760 to 1762, Jefferson attended William and Mary College and\nthere befriended Professor William Small. He wrote in his\nAutobiography, “It was my great good fortune, and what probably\nfixed the destinies of my life that Dr. Wm. Small of Scotland was then\nprofessor of Mathematics, a man profound in most of the useful\nbranches of science, with a happy talent of communication, correct and\ngentlemanly manners, & an enlarged & liberal mind.”\nSmall, Jefferson added, had become attached to Jefferson, who became\nhis “daily companion when not engaged in the school.” From\nSmall, Jefferson learned of the “expansion of science & of\nthe system of things in which we are placed” ([Au], pp.\n4–5). Small introduced Jefferson to lawyer George Wythe, who\n“continued to be my faithful and beloved Mentor in youth, and my\nmost affectionate friend through life,” and under whom Jefferson\nwould soon be apprenticed in law—and Wythe introduced Jefferson\nto Governor Francis Fauquier, governor of Virginia from 1758 till his\ndeath ([Au], pp. 4–5). Small and Wythe especially would prove to\nbe cynosures to the young man. \nUpon leaving William and Mary (1762) and to the time he began his\nlegal practice (1767), Jefferson, under the tutelage of Wythe ([Au:\n5), undertook a rigorous course of study of law, which comprised for\nhim study of not just the standard legal texts of the day but also\nanything of potential practical significance to advance human affairs.\nFor Jefferson, a lawyer, having a mastery of all things except\nmetempirical subjects and fiction, would be a human encyclopedia of\nuseful knowledge. Advisory letters to John Garland Jefferson (11 June\n1790) and to Bernard Moore (30 Aug. 1814) show a lengthy and full\ncourse of study, involving physical studies, morality, religion,\nnatural law, politics, history, belle lettres, criticism, rhetoric,\nand oratory. Thereby, a lawyer would be fully readied for any turn of\nevents in a case. As lawyer, Jefferson’s focus, David Konig\nnotes, was cases involving property—e.g., the legal acquisition\nof lands and the quieting of titles—and that, adds Konig, shaped\nhis political thinking on the need of the relative equal distribution\nof property among all male citizens for sound Republican\ngovernment. \nAs lawyer, Jefferson took up six pro bono cases of slaves,\nseeking freedom. In the case of slave Samuel Howell in Howell v.\nNetherland (Apr. 1770), Jefferson argued, in keeping with sentiments\nhe would include years later in his Declaration of Independence,\n“Under the law of nature, all men are born free, every one comes\ninto the world with a right to his own person, which includes the\nliberty of moving and using it at his own will.” The case was\nawarded to Netherland, before his lawyer, George Wythe, could present\nhis case (Catterall, 90–91). \nJefferson would practice law till August 11, 1774, when he passed his\npractice to Edmund Randolph at the start of the Revolutionary War. \nIn 1769, Jefferson gained admittance to the Virginian House of\nBurgesses. Delegates’ minds were, he said, “circumscribed\nwithin narrow limits by an habitual belief that it was our duty to be\nsubordinate to the mother country in all matters of government”\n([Au], p. 5). Jefferson’s thinking inclined otherwise. The\nexperience in the House of Delegates substantially shaped his\nrevolutionary spirit. \nOn February 1, 1770, Jefferson lost most of the books of his first\nlibrary when a fire razed his house at Shadwell. Of the loss of his\nbooks, he wrote to boyhood friend John Page (21 Feb. 1770),\n“Would to god it had been the money [that the books cost and not\nthe books]; then had it never cost me a sigh!” He was to have\ntwo other libraries at Monticello in his life, which, because of his\npassion for learning, centered on books. When he built his residence\nat Poplar Forest early in the nineteenth century, he kept there a\nnumber of books—focused on philosophy, history, and\nreligion—for his own enjoyment. \nJefferson took as his wife Martha Wayles Skelton on January 1, 1772.\nIn that same year, daughter Martha was born. In 1778, daughter Mary\nwas born. \nUpon retirement from law in 1774, Jefferson wrote Summary View of the\nRights of British America—“an humble and dutiful\naddress” of complaints addressed to King George III of England.\nThe complaints concerned numerous American rights, contravened, and\naimed at “some redress of their injured rights” ([S],\n105). Due to its trenchant tone, it earned Jefferson considerable\nreputation among congressmen as a gifted writer and as a\nrevolutionist. \nJefferson was elected to the Continental Congress in 1775 as its\nsecond youngest member. He was soon invited to participate in a\ncommittee with John Adams, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin, and\nRobert Livingston to draft a declaration on American independence. It\nwas decided that Jefferson himself should compose a draft. As John\nAdams writes to Timothy Pickering (6 Aug. 1822) concerning his reasons\nfor Jefferson being the sole drafter of the document: “Reason\n1st. You are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head\nof this business. Reason 2nd. I am obnoxious, suspected, and\nunpopular; You are very much otherwise. Reason 3rd. You can write ten\ntimes better than I can” (Adams). For over two weeks, Jefferson\nworked on the Declaration of Independence in an upper-floor apartment\nat Seventh Street and Market Street in Philadelphia. \nThe document was intended to be “an expression of the American\nmind” and was put forth to the “tribunal of the\nworld.” Jefferson’s draft listed certain “sacred\n& undeniable” truths: that all men are created “equal\n& independent”; that “from that equal creation,”\nall have the rights “to the preservation of life, & liberty,\n& the pursuit of happiness”; that governments, deriving\ntheir “just powers from the consent of the governed,” are\ninstituted to secure such rights; and that the people have a right to\nabolish any government which “becomes destructive of these\nends” and to institute a new government, by “laying its\nfoundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form,\nas to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and\nHappiness” ([D], 19). \nRigorous debate followed. Excisions and changes were made to reduce\nJefferson’s draft to three-quarters of its original length,\nthough the basic structure and the argument therein—a tightly\nstructured argument that begins with rights, turns to duties of\ngovernment, and moves to a justification for revolutionary behavior\nwhen citizens’ rights are consistently transgressed by\ngovernment—was unaltered. Thus, the Declaration contained the\nrudiments of a political philosophy that would be fleshed out in the\ndecades that followed. The document, not thought to be significant at\nthe time, was approved on July 4, 1776, and it would become one of the\nmost significant political writings ever composed. \nNot long after Jefferson finished the Declaration on Independence, he\nwas appointed to a committee to revise the outdated laws of Virginia,\nas a result of a bill introduced to the General Assembly of Virginia.\nThat was a hefty task, which Jefferson—as part of a committee\ncomprising also Thomas Ludwell Lee, George Mason, Edmund Pendleton,\nand George Wythe—began in 1776. Of the five, Lee and Mason\nexcused themselves, and revision, comprising 126 bills, was undertaken\nby Jefferson, Wythe, and Pendleton. Revision was completed in 1779, a\nperiod of not quite three years. Notable among the bills Jefferson\ndrafted, were Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge and\nBill for Religious Freedom. The latter was passed while Jefferson was\nin France as Minister Plenipotentiary; the former, requiring educative\nreforms that demanded a system of public education, did not pass. \nFrom 1779 to 1781, Jefferson began tenure as governor of Virginia.\nDuring his governorship, he reformed the curriculum of William and\nMary College by “abolishing the Grammar school,”\neliminating the professorships in Divinity and Oriental languages, and\nsupplanting them with professorships in Law and Police; Anatomy,\nMedicine, and Chemistry; and Modern Languages ([Au], p. 5). He also\nbegan his only book, Notes on the State of Virginia, in which\nhe described the geography, climate, and people of Virginia and their\nlaws, religions, manners, and commerce, among other things. The book,\nin general, was well received by his Enlightenment friends and did\neven more to enhance his reputation as a gifted writer. \nJefferson’s wife Martha died on September 6, 1782.\nOverwhelmingly distraught, he found some consolation in an invitation\nto function as Minister to France—he needed to be away from\nMonticello—which he did from 1784 to 1789. He ended the post at\nthe bidding of George Washington, who asked him to be his Secretary of\nState—a post he held till 1793. Political disagreements between\nJefferson and Alexander Hamilton on political issues resulted in\nformation of the Republican and Federalist parties—the former,\nchampioning small, unobtrusive government and strict constructionism;\nthe latter, larger, strong government and a less strict interpretation\nof the Constitution. After a brief retirement, he was elected\nVice-President of the United States for one term that ended in 1801,\nand then President of the United States, which lasted two terms. His\npresidency, which began triumphantly with his conciliatory First\nInaugural Address, was highlighted by the Louisiana Purchase in 1803,\nwhich doubled the size of the country; the subsequent Lewis and Clark\nExpedition, which ended in 1806; and the failed Embargo Act of 1807,\nwhich aimed, among other things, to punish England during its war with\nFrance, by prohibiting exchange of goods. During his tenure as\npresident, his daughter Maria died (1804). \nIn retirement, Jefferson resumed his domestic life at Monticello,\ncontinued as president of the American Philosophical Society (a\nposition he held for nearly 20 years), and began activities that would\nlead to the birth of the University of Virginia, which opened one year\nbefore his death. Irretrievably saddled with debt throughout his\nretirement, he sold his library, approximately 6,700 books, to\nCongress in 1815 to pay off some of that debt. He died, as did John\nAdams, on July 4, 1826. On his obelisk, there was written, upon his\nrequest ([E]: 706): \nHere was buried\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nAuthor of the Declaration of American Independence\n\nOf the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom\n\n& Father of the University of Virginia.  \nJefferson wrote prodigiously. He penned some 19,000 letters. He\npublished Notes on the State of Virginia (English version) in\n1787. He wrote key declarations such as Summary View of the Rights of\nBritish Americans (1774), Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of\nTaking Up Arms (1775), and the Declaration of Independence (1776);\nauthored numerous bills; and wrote his Manual of Parliamentary\nPractice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, a\nmodified copy of which was still in use till 1977. He put together two\nharmonies, The Philosophy of Jesus (1804)—no copies are\nknown to survive—and The Life and Morals of Jesus of\nNazareth (1820), by extracting passages from the New Testament.\nLast, Jefferson undertook late in life an autobiography (never\ncompleted), “for my own ready reference & for the\ninformation of my family” ([Au]: 3). \nLike many other contemporaries he read—e.g., Hutcheson, Kames,\nBolingbroke, Tracy, and Hume—Jefferson was an empiricist, and in\nkeeping with Isaac Newton, a dyed-in-the-wool materialist. To John\nAdams (15 Aug. 1820), he writes, “A single sense may indeed be\nsometimes\n decieved,[1]\n but rarely: and never all our senses together, with their faculty of\nreasoning.” Jefferson continues: “‘I feel: therefore\nI exist.’ I feel bodies which are not myself: there are other\nexistencies then. I call them matter. I feel them changing place. This\ngives me motion. Where there is an absence of matter, I call it void,\nor nothing, or immaterial space.” Given matter and motion,\neverything else, even thinking, is explicable. As all loadstones are\nmagnetic, matter too is merely “an action of a particular\norganization of matter, formed for that purpose by it’s\ncreator.” Even mind and god are material. “To talk of\nimmaterial existences is to talk of nothings.” \nTo Massachusetts politician Edward Everett (24 Feb. 1823), Jefferson\nsays that observed particulars are found to be nothing but\nconcretizations of atoms. He cautions, “By analyzing too\nminutely we often reduce our subject to atoms, of which the mind loses\nhold.” That suggests a sort of pragmatic\natomism—viz., atoms being merely arbitrary\nepistemological stopping points in the analysis of matter to keep the\nmind from entertaining the dizzying thought of dividing without\nend. \nJefferson, however, was not a metaphysical atomist of the Epicurean\nsort, but a nominalist like philosopher John Locke (1690). To New\nJersey politician Dr. John Manners (22 Feb. 1814), he says: \nNature has, in truth, produced units only through all her works.\nClasses, orders, genera, species, are not of her works. Her creation\nis of individuals. No two animals are exactly alike; no two plants,\nnor even two leaves or blades of grass; no two crystallizations. And\nif we may venture from what is within the cognizance of such organs as\nours, to conclude on that beyond their powers, we must believe that no\ntwo particles of matter are of exact resemblance.  \nHumans categorize out of need, for the “infinitude of units or\nindividuals” outstrips the capacity of memory. There is grouping\nand subgrouping until there are formed classes, orders, genera, and\nspecies. Yet such grouping is man’s doing, not\n nature’s.[2]\n Jefferson begins with biota—the system he questions is the\nSwedish botanist Carl Linnaeus’—and works his way down to\n“particles of matter.” \nIn Jefferson’s cosmos, which is Stoic-like in etiology, all\nevents are linked. The hand of deity is manifestly behind the\netiological arrangements. Jefferson writes to Adams (11 Apr.\n1823): \nI hold (without appeal to revelation) that when we take a view of the\nuniverse; in it’s parts general or particular, it is impossible\nfor the human mind not to percieve and feel a conviction of design,\nconsummate skill, and indefinite power in every atom of it’s\ncomposition. The movements of the heavenly bodies, so exactly held in\ntheir courses by the balance of centrifugal and centripetal forces;\nthe structure of our earth itself, with its distribution of lands,\nwaters, and atmosphere; animal and vegetable bodies, each perfectly\norganized whether as insect, man or mammoth; it is impossible not to\nbelieve, that there is in all this, design, cause and effect, up to an\nultimate cause, a Fabricator of all things from matter and motion,\ntheir preserver and regulator while permitted to exist in their\npresent forms, and their regenerator into new and other forms. \nThe language of perception is in keeping with his empiricism; the\nlanguage of feel, with his appropriation of philosophers Destutt de\nTracy’s (1818/1827: 164) and Lord Kames’ (1758: 250)\nepistemology. Appeal to an ultimate cause implies a demiurge, of whose\nnature little can be known other than its superior intelligence and\noverall\n beneficence.[3]\n There is nothing here or in any other cosmological letters to suggest\nthat deity privileges human life any more than, in David Hume’s\nwords, “that of an oyster” (1755 [1987]: 583). \nJefferson continues in his 1823 letter to Adams. Deity superintends\nthe cosmos. Some stars disappear; others come to be. Comets, with\ntheir “incalculable courses”, deviate from regular orbits\nand demand “renovation under other laws.” Some species of\nanimal have become extinct. “Were there no restoring power, all\nexistences might extinguish successively, one by one, until all should\nbe reduced to a shapeless chaos.” \nWhat precisely does divine superintendence entail? \nWilliam Wilson argues that the “‘cut’ of\nJefferson’s mind” demands theism—divine\ninterpositionism. He writes: \nHolowchak thinks that it is unlikely that divine\nsuperintendence—i.e., extinction and restoration—implies\nsupernatural intervention in the natural course of events (e.g., TJ to\nFrancis Adrian Van der Kemp, 25 Sept. 1816, and TJ to Daniel Salmon,\n15 Feb. 1808). It is probable, thinks Holowchak, that a natural\ncapacity for restoration exists in certain types of matter in the same\nway that mind, for Jefferson, is in certain types of matter (2013a).\nDeity’s superintendence is likely the capacity for\npre-established cosmic self-regulation comparable in some sense to the\nwork of a thermostat in regulating the temperature of a\n building.[4]\n Following Lord Bolingbroke whose views from Philosophical\nWorks he “commonplaced” early in life ([LCB]:\n40–55), Jefferson believed that to posit that God needed to\nintervene in cosmic events to keep aright them (e.g., by sending down\nJesus to save humanity) was to belie the capacities of deity. God,\nthought Bolingbroke, and Jefferson’s god owed more to\nBolingbroke than to any other thinker, got things right the first\ntime. \nHow for Jefferson does man leave the state of nature and enter into\nsociety? Jefferson appeals to nature in what one scholar calls a\n“middle landscape” manner (Marx 1964: 104–5). The\nhappiest state for humans is one that seeks a middle ground between\nwhat is savage and what is “refined.” Jefferson’s\nvision, thinks Marx, is Arcadian. Jefferson’s aim, early\nwritings indicate (e.g., TJ to James Madison, 20 Dec. 1787 and [NV]:\n290–91), was for America to be a pastoral society that had the\nfreedom of primitivism, because it was neither materialist nor\nmanufacturing and it had an abundancy of land. America, because it was\nneither primitive nor uncultured, could have the trimmings of cultured\nsocieties, without their degenerative excesses. \nJefferson’s natural-law theory is Stoical, not Hobbesian or\nRousseauian. For Jefferson, the basal laws of nature that obtain when\nman is in the state of nature are roughly the self-same laws that\nobtain in civil society. They are also roughly the same basal laws\nthat obtain between states. \nThe moral duties which exist between individual and individual in the\nstate of nature, accompany them into a state of society, and the\naggregate of the duties of all the individuals composing the society\nconstitutes the duties of that society towards any other; so that\nbetween society and society the same moral duties exist as did between\nindividuals composing them, while in an unassociated state, and their\nmaker not having released them from those duties on their forming\nthemselves into a nation ([F]: 423). \nThe ideological frame that allows for social stability is in the\nDeclaration of Independence, in which Jefferson lists two self-evident\ntruths: the equality of all men and their endowment of unalienable\nrights. \n“Equality” for Jefferson comprises equality of opportunity\nand moral equality. Equality of opportunity recognizes the differences\nbetween persons—e.g., talents, prior social status, education,\nand wealth—and seeks to level the playing field through\nrepublican reforms such as introduction of a bill to secure human\nrights; elimination of primogeniture, entails, and state-sanctioned\nreligion; periodic constitutional renewal; and and educational reform\nfor the self-sufficiency of the general citizenry. To remedy the\nunequal distribution of property, Jefferson advocates in his Draft\nConstitution for Virginia that 50 acres of property go to every male\n Virginian[5]\n ([CV]: 343). Moral equality recognizes that each human deserves equal\nstatus in personhood and citizenship, hence again the need of\nrepublican reforms of the sort listed above. \nRights are held to obtain, whether or not holders recognize them, and\nthey have a moral dimension apart from their obvious legal dimension.\nThere are, for instance, the moral obligations to obey the law and to\nrecognize and uphold the rights of\n others.[6] \nJefferson, mostly following Locke, mentions three unalienable rights\nin the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and pursuit of\nhappiness. The right to life constitutes a right to one’s own\npersonhood. The rights to liberty and pursuit of happiness (Locke\nlists property instead of happiness) entail self-determination through\nlabor, art, industry, and self-governance. Government has no right to\ncontrol the lives of its citizens or dictate a course of happiness.\nTherein lies the foundation of Jeffersonian liberalism. \nThere is also the right to revolution, which entails the right to\nabolish any tyrannical form of government, given long abuses. \nThe right to the pursuit of happiness implies too that all persons are\nfree to worship as they choose. Since religion is a matter between a\nman and his deity (e.g., TJ to Miles King, 26 Sept. 1814), no one owes\nany account of his faith to another. Moreover, legislature should make\n“no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting\nthe free exercise thereof,” thus building a wall of separation\nbetween church and state ([DB]:\n 510).[7] \nBeing personal, religion ought not to be politicized. When the clergy\nengraft themselves into the “machine of government,” they\nprove a “very formidable engine against the civil and religious\nrights of man” (TJ to Jeremiah Moor, 14 Aug. 1800). All people,\nJefferson asserts, should follow the example of the Quakers: live\nwithout priests, be guided their internal monitor of right and wrong,\nand eschew matters inaccessible to common sense, for belief can only\nrightly be shaped by “the assent of the mind to an intelligible\nproposition” (TJ to John Adams, 22 Aug. 1813). \nThe true principles of morality are the “mild and simple\nprinciples of the Christian philosophy” (TJ to Gerry Elbridge,\n29 Mar. 1801)—the principles common to all right-intended\nreligions. Jefferson writes to Thomas Leiper (21 Jan. 1809): \nMy religious reading has long been confined to the moral branch of\nreligion, which is the same in all religions; while in that branch\nwhich consists of dogmas, all differ, all have a different set. The\nformer instructs us how to live well and worthily in society; the\nlatter are made to interest our minds in the support of the teachers\nwho inculcate\n them.[8] \nThus, the principles common to all religions are few, exoteric, and\nthe true principles of\n morality.[9] \nThough chary of sectarian religion due to the empleomania of sectarian\nclerics and a sharp critic of Christianity in his youth ([NR]),\n“Christianity,” deterged of its political trappings and\nmetaphysical twaddle, in time became special to Jefferson (e.g., TJ to\nJohn Adams, 12 Oct. 1813 and 24 Jan. 1814). He states to Dr. Benjamin\nRush (21 Apr. 1803): \nI am a Christian, in the only sense [Jesus] wished any one to be;\nsincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others;\nascribing to him every human excellence; & believing he\nnever claimed any other. \nJesus’ teachings make up the greatest moral system, and Jesus is\n“the greatest of all the [religious]\n reformers.”[10]\n To Benjamin Waterhouse (26 June 1822), Jefferson writes: \nThe doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the happiness of\nman. 1. That there is one only God, and he all perfect. 2. That there\nis a future state of rewards and punishments. 3. That to love God with\nall thy heart and thy neighbor as thyself, is the sum of religion.\n \nConsequently, Jesus’ message comprises love of god (being one,\npace Calvin, not three), love of mankind, and belief in an\nafterlife of reward or punishment. \nYet much in the Bible, Jefferson thought, was redundant, hyperbolic,\nbathetic, absurd, and beyond the bounds of physical possibility (e.g.,\nTJ to John Adams, 28 Oct. 1813). That was confirmed by inspection of a\nlate-in-life “harmony” Jefferson constructed, The Life\nand Morals of Jesus of Nazareth (1820), in which the virgin\nbirth, miraculous cures, and resurrection were excised. Christ was\nneither the savior of mankind nor the son of God, but the great moral\nreformer of the Jewish religion([B]). \nEven after he purged the Bible of its corruptions—in his own\nwords, after he plucked, in an oft-used metaphor, the diamonds from\nthe dungheap (TJ to John Adams, 12 Oct. 1813, and TJ to )—to try\nboth to make plain Jesus’ true teachings and to give a credible\naccount of the life of Jesus, Jefferson did not completely follow\nJesus’ uncontaminated teachings. He did think love of God was\nneeded for one to be of upstanding virtue, for each could see and feel\nthe existence of deity in the cosmos. Thus, atheists, however\nostensibly virtuous, suffered from a defect of moral sensibility. Yet\nwhen Jefferson expressed his own view on the branches of morality\n(true religion), he did not mention belief in an afterlife, as did\n Jesus.[11]\n His 1814 letter to Law (13 June) mentions belief in an afterlife\nmerely as one of the correctives to lack of a moral sense, along with\nself-interest, the approbation of others upon doing good, and the\nrewards and punishments of laws. Given that, along with his\nout-and-out commitment to materialism and given the evidence of four\nletters that unequivocally express skepticism apropos of an\n afterlife,[12]\n and given that he and his wife wrote about the “eternal\nseparation” they were about to make on her deathbed, it is\nprobable, asserts one scholar, that he did not believe in an afterlife\n(Holowchak 2019a, pp. 128–2). So, belief in an afterlife, one of\nthe chief teachings of Jesus, was likely not an essential part of\nmorality for Jefferson. In contrast, Charles Sanford, noting that\nJefferson appeals to the hereafter in several letters and addresses,\noffers a small-step argument in defense of belief in an afterlife.\n“‘The prospects of a future state of retribution for the\nevil as well as the good done while here’ [are] among the moral\nforces necessary to motivate individuals to live good lives in\nsociety.” He adds: “Jefferson had begun with the\nconviction that God had created in man a hunger for the rights of\nequality, freedom, and life and a desire to follow God’s moral\nlaw. It was only a small step further to believe that God had also\ncreated man with an immortal soul”\n (152).[13] \nFinally, Jefferson later in life claimed to be a Unitarian. What did\n“Unitarianism” mean for him? \nJefferson finds the notion of three deities in one inscrutable, and\ntherefore physically impossible. Here he falls back on his naturalism.\nHe allows nothing inconsistent with the laws of nature, gleaned\nthrough experience. The sort of Unitarianism Jefferson promotes is not\na religious sect, but instead a manner of approaching religion. Of his\nUnitarianism, Jefferson asserts to John Adams (22 Aug. 1813),\n“We should all then, like the Quakers, live without an order of\npriests, moralize for ourselves, follow the oracle of conscience, and\nsay nothing about what no man can understand, nor therefore\nbelieve.” To Dr. Thomas Cooper (2 Nov. 1822), Jefferson\ncontrasts Unitarians with sectarian preachers, so Unitarians can be\ngrasped as persons living fully in accordance with the dictates of\ntheir moral sense faculty. To Benjamin Waterhouse (8 Jan. 1825),\nJefferson states that Unitarianism is “primitive Christianity,\nin all the simplicity in which it came from the lips of Jesus.”\nSuch letters show plainly that monotheism, incomplexity, and\nnon-sectarianism are dependent issues. Jefferson made purchase of\nmonotheism because it and benevolence were key tenets of Jesus’\nuncorrupted teachings. Those two tenets, letters indicate, were the\nframework of his Unitarianism, or of any right religion. \nFor Jefferson, morality was not reason-guided, but dictated by a moral\nsense. Here he followed Scottish\n empiricists,[14]\n such as William Small (Hull 1997: 102–5 and [Au]:\n4–5)—the only non-minister at William and Mary\nCollege—and Francis Hutcheson and especially Lord\n Kames.[15] \nTo nephew Peter Carr (19 Aug. 1785), Jefferson says that the god-given\nmoral sense, innate and instinctual, is as much a part of a\nperson’s nature as are the senses of hearing and seeing, or as\nis a leg or arm. Jefferson’s comparisons to hearing and sight\ninvite depiction of the moral sense tied to a bodily organ, like the\nheart (TJ to Maria Cosway, 12 Oct. 1785). Like strength of limbs, it\ntoo is given to persons in a greater or lesser degree, and can be made\nbetter or worse through exercise or its neglect. \nA letter to daughter Martha (11 Dec. 1783) suggests the moral sense\nworks spontaneously, without any input of reason. The language of\n“feel” is critical. \nIf ever you are about to say any thing amiss or to do any thing wrong,\nconsider before hand. You will feel something within you which will\ntell you it is wrong and ought not to be said or done: this is your\nconscience, and be sure to obey\n it.[16] \nOne ought to resist the temptation to act viciously in circumstances\nwhen vice will not be detected. He tells Carr (19 Aug. 1785) to act\nalways and in all circumstances as if everyone in the world were\nlooking at him. Jefferson bids grandson Thomas Jefferson Randolph (24\nNov. 1808) to appeal to moral exemplars before acting, and he lists\nSmall, Wythe, and Peyton Randolph. “I am certain that this mode\nof deciding on my conduct, tended more to correctness than any\nreasoning powers I possessed.” Thus, one can use the moral sense\nunerringly, or relatively so, if one disregards the intrusions of\nreason and assumes that all of one’s actions are under the\nscrutiny of cynosures—i.e., there will be no temptation to act\nfrom the pressure of peers. In another letter to Carr (10 Aug. 1787),\nJefferson disadvises his nephew to attend lectures on moral philosophy\nand appeals counterfactually to a ham-handed creator. “He who\nmade us would have been a pitiful bungler if he had made the rules of\nour moral conduct a matter of science.” Here and\n elsewhere,[17]\n Jefferson is explicit that reason is uninvolved in moral\n“judgments.” \nNot everyone possesses a moral sense. Napoleon, he tells Adams (25\nFeb. 1823), is an illustration. To Thomas Law (13 June 1814),\nJefferson says that want of the moral sense can somewhat be rectified\nby education and employment of rational calculation, but such\neducative remedies are blandishments not aimed to encourage morally\ncorrect action, because that is impossible without a moral sense, but\nto discourage actions with pernicious consequences. In short, one\nwithout a moral sense can be induced or shaped to behave as if having\na moral sense, though such actions would merely be consistent with\nmorally correct actions, not be morally correct actions. \nFinally, the function of reason, he says in his 1787 letter to Carr,\nis “in some degree” to oversee the exercise of the moral\nfaculty, “but it is a small stock which is required for\nthis”. Reason might function, thinks one scholar, (1) to\nencourage or reinforce morally correct\n action,[18]\n (2) to keep the moral sense vital and vigorous, (3) to instill the\nfirst elements of morality in children through exposure to history,\n(4) to allow for cultural sensitivity to morally retarded cultures,\n(5) to continue moral advance through reading history as adults, (6)\nto help make plain the rights (especially derivative rights) of\nhumans, (7) to form general rules to serve as rough guides human\n action,[19]\n and (8) to encourage moral improvement through breeding for morality\n(Holowchak 2014b, 177–80). None of those functions, however,\ndirectly involves reason in moral “judgments.” \nJefferson also believed, following the lead of many thinkers of his\nday—e.g., Francis Ferguson, John Millar, Lord Kames (1798 and\n1774), William Robertson, Claude Adrien Helvétius, the Marquis\nde Condorcet, and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot—that humans were\nmorally progressing over time (e.g., TJ to John Adams, 11 Jan. 1816,\nand TJ to P.S. Dupont de Nemours, 24 Apr. 1816). There were, however,\nperiodic glitches—periods of moral stagnation or decline. The\nbelligerence between England and France in Jefferson’s later\nyears was to him evidence of such decline. Still, such moral\ndeclinations, considered overall, were temporary setbacks or\n“retrogradations,” not genuine declinations. In a letter\nto Adams (1 Aug. 1816), he writes that the Americas will show Europe\nthe path to moral advance. \nWe are destined to be a barrier against the returns of ignorance and\nbarbarism. Old Europe will have to lean on our shoulders, and to\nhobble along by our side, under the monkish trammels of priest and\nkings, as she can. \nThus, moral progress is movement, prompted by embrace of liberty and\nrespect for humans’ rights, toward the ideals of love of deity\nand love of humanity through beneficence—the ideals taught best\nby\n Jesus.[20] \nIn his First Inaugural Address (1801), Jefferson lists the\n“essential principles of our Government” in 15\ndoctrines—perhaps his first attempt at a definition of\nrepublicanism ([I1]: 494–95). \nFifteen years later in a series of letters, Jefferson again grapples\nwith a definition of “republicanism.” To P.S. Dupont de\nNemours (24 Apr. 1816), Jefferson lists nine “moral\nprinciples” upon which republican government is grounded. \nI believe with you that morality, compassion, generosity, are innate\nelements of the human constitution; that there exists a right\nindependent of force; that a right to property is founded in our\nnatural wants, in the means with which we are endowed to satisfy these\nwants, and the right to what we acquire by those means without\nviolating the similar rights of other sensible beings; that no one has\na right to obstruct another, exercising his faculties innocently for\nthe relief of sensibilities made a part of his nature; that justice is\nthe fundamental law of society; that the majority, oppressing an\nindividual, is guilty of a crime, abuses its strength, and by acting\non the law of the strongest breaks up the foundations of society; that\naction by the citizens in person, in affairs within their reach and\ncompetence, and in all others by representatives, chosen immediately,\nand removable by themselves, constitutes the essence of a republic;\nthat all governments are more or less republican in proportion as this\nprinciple enters more or less into their composition; and that a\ngovernment by representation is capable of extension over a greater\nsurface of country than one of any other form. \nAmong the nine principles, the seventh \nAction by the citizens in person, in affairs within their reach and\ncompetence, and in all others by representatives, chosen immediately,\nand removable by themselves, constitutes the essence of a\nrepublic. \ncomes closest to the essence of republicanism. To John Taylor (28 May\n1816), Jefferson attempts a “precise and definite idea” of\nrepublicanism: \nA government by its citizens in mass, acting directly and personally,\naccording to rules established by the majority. \nHe adds, \nEvery other government is more or less republican, in proportion as it\nhas in this composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct\naction of the citizens. \nTo Samuel Kercheval (12 July 1816), Jefferson gives his “mother\nprinciple”: \nGovernments are republican only in proportion as they embody the will\nof their people, and execute it.  \nHe adds, \nA government is republican in proportion as every member composing it\nhas his equal voice in the direction of its concerns (not indeed in\nperson, which would be impracticable beyond the limits of a city, or\nsmall township, but) by representatives chosen by himself, and\nresponsible to him at short periods). \nSuch writings suggest the following “barebones” definition\nof “republic” for Jefferson, or a “Jeffersonian\nrepublic”: \nA government is a Jeffersonian republic if and only if it allows all\ncitizens ample opportunity to participate politically in affairs\nwithin their reach and competency; it employs representatives, chosen\nand recallable by the citizenry and functioning for short periods, for\naffairs outside citizens’ reach and competency; it functions\naccording to the rules (periodically revisable) established by the\nmajority of the citizens; and it guarantees the equal rights, in\nperson and property, of all citizens. \nThe definition is barebones for several reasons. First, it does not\nfully capture the normative essence of Jefferson’s description\nof what is “proper for all conditions of society” in his\nletter to Dupont de Nemours. Yet it is not normatively neutral, as it\nspeaks of equality of opportunity for each citizen to participate in\ngovernment and it guarantees equal rights. Second, the definition\nignores the partnership of politics and science, which is part of\nJefferson’s conception of a republic. Jefferson insisted on\nperiodic revisions of the Constitution at conventions to accommodate\nchanges in the peoples’ will, when suitably informed. Such\nchanges were not arbitrary, but dictated mostly by advances in\n science.[21]\n Jefferson writes to Samuel Kercheval (12 July 1816), “The laws\nand constitutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human\nmind.” Thus, a republic for Jefferson is essentially progressive\nand scientific, not static and conservative. \nThus, Jeffersonian republicanism is a schema for government\nby the people, not any particular system of\ngoverning. It is not wedded to any particular\nconstitution—constitutions, Jefferson is clear, are merely\nprovisional representations of the will of the people at the time of\ntheir drafting (TJ to George Washington, 7 Nov. 1792)—but to the\nprinciple of government representing the will of the people, suitably\ninformed. That is why Jefferson says in his First Inaugural Address\nthat for the will of the majority to be reasonable, it must be\nrightful ([I1]:\n 493).[22]\n Thus, Jeffersonian republicanism is essentially in partnership with\nscience. \nJefferson’s attempts at defining “republic” and his\nnine moral principles “proper for all conditions of\nsociety” shows that republicanism is a political philosophy. For\nJefferson, republican governing is essentially progressive, and being\ngovernment of and for the people, it aims at involving all citizens to\ntheir fullest capacity. Over the centuries, he recognized, human\npotentiality had been stifled by coercive governments. Instantiation\nof republican governing, thus, was an attempt to impose the minimal\npolitical structure needed to maximize human liberty, free human\npotentiality, and ensure the political ascendency of the\n“natural aristoi,” the talented and virtuous, and\nnot the “artificial aristoi,” the wealthy and\nwellborn. \nJefferson’s republicanism was both democratic and meritocratic.\nIt was democratic in that it aimed roughly to have no person\ndisadvantaged at the start of life. That would be the same for Blacks,\nwho were the equals of all others in moral sensibility—hence,\ntheir desert of equal rights and equal opportunities. Democratic\nrepublicanism demanded recognition of moral equality and equality of\nopportunity. Yet Jefferson realized that each person’s dreams,\nintelligence, and talents varied greatly. Thus, Jeffersonian\nrepublicanism was also meritocratic in that all persons were allowed\nto do with their life what they saw fit to do with it, so long as in\ndoing so they did not disallow others the opportunity of doing what\nthey saw fit to do. The most talented and virtuous, he assumed, would\nnaturally strive to exercise fully their talents and virtue through\npolitics and science. \nJefferson recognized two classes of people: laborers and learned (TJ\nto Peter Carr, 7 Sept. 1814). His distinction, however, was not\ndetermined by birth or wealth, as it was by most others of his day,\nbut by merit. To John Adams (28 Oct. 1813), Jefferson writes: \nThere is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of this are\nvirtue and talents. \nHe adds, \nThere is also an artificial aristocracy founded on wealth and birth,\nwithout either virtue or talents; for with these it would belong to\nthe first class. \nWhat Jefferson claimed here was that the traditional, centuries-old\nclass distinction, founded on birth or wealth, was in effect\npolitically obsolete. What made men “best” was talent\n(i.e., skill, ambition, and genius) and virtue. \nJefferson then tells Adams that the natural aristoi comprise\n“the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the\ntrust, and government of society.” He adds that that government\nis best which allows for “a pure selection of these natural\naristoi into the offices of government.” Through\n“instruction, trust, and government,” the natural\naristoi will be not only political officials, but also\nteachers, trustees, and practitioners or patrons of\n science.[23] \nTo ensure that political offices will be held by the natural\naristoi, there must be, inter alia, public access to\ngeneral education and free presses for dissemination of information to\nthe citizenry. With the citizenry generally educated, one has,\nJefferson continues to Adams, merely “to leave to the citizens\nthe free election and separation of the aristoi from the\npseudo-aristoi,” and “in general they will elect\nthe real good and\n wise.”[24]\n That is much preferable to the centuries-old method of allowing the\nwealthy and wellborn to govern at the expense of the people. \nFor Jefferson, constitutions, unlike the rights of men, are alterable,\nin conformance to the level of progress of a state. Thus,\nconstitutions are to be replaced, altered, or renewed pursuant to\nhumans’ intellectual, political, and moral progress. \nTo James Madison (6 Sept. 1789), Jefferson writes: \nThe question Whether one generation of men has a right to bind another\n… is a question of such consequences as not only to merit\ndecision, but place also, among the fundamental principles of every\n government.[25] \nBeginning with the evident proposition—“the earth belongs\nin usufruct to the living”—Jefferson aims to prove that\nthe deeds of each generation, defined by a nineteen-year\n period,[26]\n ought to be independent (or relatively so) of each other. Moreover,\n“usufruct” implies that each generation has an obligation\nto leave behind their property to the subsequent generation at least\nin the same condition in which it was received. For instance, any\ndebts one incurs while owning some land are not to be inherited by\nanother who obtains possession of that land after the former passes.\nWhat applies to individuals applies to any collection of\nindividuals. \nTo instantiate the principle, there must be a period of adjustment.\nPresent debts will be a matter of honor and expediency; future debts\nwill be constrained by the principle. To constrain future debts, a\nconstitution ought to stipulate that a nation can borrow no more than\nit can repay in the span of a generation. Temperate borrowing would\n“bridle the spirit of war,” inflamed much by the neglect\nof repayment of debts. \nUsufruct theoretically fits neatly with Jefferson’s notions of\npolitical progress and of periodic constitutional renewal. Concerning\nthe latter, he writes to C.F.W. Malone (10 Sept. 1787): \nNo society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law.\n… Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at\nthe end of 19. years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force\nand not of right. \nAt the end of nineteen years, there will be a constitutional\nconvention, at which defects in laws can be addressed and changes can\nbe\n made.[27]\n Should the principle of usufruct be adopted, republican government\nwould have a built-in mechanism for obviating\n revolutions.[28]\n Without the debts and wars of one generation passed on to the next in\na Jeffersonian republic and with that republic’s constitution\nbeing renewed each generation to accommodate the needs and advances of\nthe next generation, Jefferson thinks, the stage is set for political\nprogress. \nJames Madison wrote a lengthy letter several months later (4 Feb.\n1790) in reply to Jefferson’s usufruct letter, and politely\nproffered “some very powerful objections.” Jefferson never\nanswered that letter, though he never renounced generational\nsovereignty. \nEven well-intended governments can still go astray. Jefferson writes\nin his Declaration of Independence, \nWhenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it\nis the right of the people to alter or abolish it, & to institute\nnew government, laying it’s foundation on such principles, &\norganizing it’s powers in such form, as to them shall seem most\nlikely to effect their safety & happiness ([D]: 19).  \nHowever, long-standing governments ought not to be changed “for\nlight & transient causes,” otherwise one risks supplantation\nof a corrupt government with another that is equally or more corrupt.\nYet \nwhen a long train of abuses & usurpations pursuing invariably the\nsame object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism,\nit is [citizens’] right, it is their duty to throw off such\ngovernment, & to provide new guards for their future security\n([D]: 19). \nIn his Summary View of the Rights of British America, Jefferson states\nthat for revolution to occur, there needs to be “many\nunwarrantable encroachments and usurpations” ([S]: 105). He\nadds, \nSingle acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a\nday; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and\npursued unalterably through every change of ministers, too plainly\nprove a deliberate and systematical plan of reducing us to slavery\n([S]: 110). \nTherefore, a government becomes destructive when its abuses and\nusurpations are (1) many and long, (2) directed to the same end, and\n(3) clearly indicative of despotism. \nFor Jefferson, some amount of turbulence is one of the consequences of\nliberty. The manure of blood is needed for healthy governing because\nthose governing will tend over time, Jefferson says to William S.\nSmith (13 Nov. 1787), to govern in their own interests, if not\ncarefully watched. Moreover, those governed will assume mistakenly\nthat rights once granted will be rights always granted. So, rebellion\nis the mechanism whereby those governing, Jefferson tells James\nMadison (30 Jan. 1787), are periodically reminded that government in a\nJeffersonian republic is of and for the people—that is, that the\nwill of the majority, fittingly educated, is the standard of\njustice. \nThe turbulence of which Jefferson speaks in the letters to Smith and\nMadison are illustrations of rebellion, says Holowchak (2019a,\n73–76), not revolution. In contrast, revolution for Jefferson,\nfollowing his Declaration, is a complex phenomenon. Unlike a\nrebellion, it is never to be undertaken for slight reasons or because\nof singular cases of governmental abuse. The difference, for\nHolowchak, is one of scope, size, and persistency. Rebellions, often\nviolent, are generally quick signals to government concerning abuses,\nusually parochial. Revolutions, essentially violent, are long-term,\nwell-planned, complex attempts at overthrowing a government, deemed\nhabitually abusive. \nMirkin interprets Jefferson otherwise. He does not distinguish between\nrebellion and revolution, but distinguishes between “two levels\nof revolt”: populist rebellions and elitist threats of\nrebellion. The former, exemplified by Shays’ Rebellion and the\nWhiskey Rebellion, are local and presumably non-moral issues. The\nlatter, exemplified by the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, are\nlarger, morality-grounded issues (e.g., transgression of rights), and\nbecause of that, there is a persistency to them (64–65).\n\n \nOne thing is clear. Revolutions or elitist rebellions, for Jefferson,\nare larger, more persistent, and more complex than rebellions or\npopulist rebellions. To John Adams (4 Sept. 1823), Jefferson writes of\nthe beginning, sustainment, and resolution of revolutions. “The\ngeneration which commences a revolution can rarely compleat it.\nHabituated from their infancy to passive submission of body and mind\nto their kings and priests, they are not qualified, when called on, to\nthink and provide for themselves, and their inexperience, their\nignorance and bigotry make them instruments often, in the hands of the\nBonapartes and Iturbides to defeat their own rights and\npurposes.” Revolutions cannot be expected to establish a\nsustainable, free government in the first effort. \nMoreover, the revolutionary generation is generally suited to begin\nand sustain the revolution, Jefferson continues in the letter to\nAdams, but not to resolve it. It is, for Jefferson, incapable of\nfixing a viable republican constitution. There are, thus, generational\nresponsibilities for a Jeffersonian revolution to succeed. The role of\nthe first generation is inchoation. Subsequent generations must\nsustain and complete the initial effort to usurp the coercive\ngovernment. In the final stage, there is implementation of a\nconstitution, reflective of and beholden to the will of the\npeople. \nIt is because of the complexity and cost, in terms of human lives,\nthat Jefferson maintained that revolutions ought only to be undertaken\nin cases of extreme, consistent despotism. As he writes in his\nDeclaration ([D]: 19), “When a long train of abuses and\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to\nreduce them [the people] under absolute Despotism, it is their right,\nit is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new\nGuards for their future security.” Still, he thought that they\nwere “mechanisms” needed in republican governments, for\nthere is a human tendency for those in power to be seduced by that\npower (TJ to Spencer Roane, 9 Mar. 1821). \nJefferson’s views on education fit hand in glove with his\npolitical\n philosophy.[29]\n To facilitate a government of and for the people, there must be\neducational reform to allow for the general education of the citizenry\nfor fullest political participation, to enable citizens to carry on\ndaily affairs without governmental intervention, and to funnel the\nmost talented and virtuous to a first-tier institution like the\nUniversity of Virginia. \nThe sources of Jefferson’s views on education were many. From\nthe French, Jefferson learned that education ought to be equalitarian,\nsecular, and philosophically grounded (Arrowood 1930 [1970]:\n49–50). He likely studied the works of Condorcet, La Chalotais,\nDiderot, Charon, and Turgot, and was influenced by men such as\nLafayette, Correa de Serra, Cuvier, Buffon, Humboldt, and Say.\nMoreover, Jefferson corresponded with or read the works of Britons and\nAmericans such as John Adams, Priestley, Locke, Thomas Cooper, Pictet,\nStewart, Tichnor, Richard Price, William Small, Wythe, Fauquier,\nPeyton Randolph, and Patrick Henry (Holowchak 2014a, 69). That\neducation ought to be scientific and useful was emphasized by William\nSmall at William and Mary College as well as his uptake of the\nempirical philosophers of his day and their disdain of metempirical\nsquabbling. \nJefferson’s educational views are spelled out neatly in four\nbills proposed to the General Assembly of Virginia (1779), in his Bill\nfor Establishing a System of Public Education (1817), in his Rockfish\nGap Report (1818), and in key letters to correspondents—e.g.,\nCarr, Banister, Munford, Adams, Cabell, Burwell, Brazier, and\nBreckinridge. \nWhen Jefferson, Pendleton, and Wythe undertook the task of revising\nthe laws of Virginia in 1776, Jefferson drafted four significant\nbills—Bills 79 to 82. \nI consider 4 of these bills … as forming a system by which\nevery fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy; and\na foundation laid for a government truly\n republican.[30]\n ([WTJ5]: 44) \nBill 79 proposed to create wards or hundreds, each of which would have\na school for general education in which “reading, writing, and\ncommon arithmetic should be taught” ([BG]). Virginia was to be\nsubdivided in twenty-four districts, each of which would have a school\nfor “classical learning, grammar, geography, and the higher\nbranches of numerical arithmetic” ([BG]). Bill 80 proposed to\nsecularize William and Mary College and add to its curriculum by\nenlarging its “sphere of science”\n ([BWM]).[31]\n Bill 81 proposed to create a public library for Virginia for\nscholars, elected officials, and inquisitive citizens ([BL]). Bill 82,\nthe only bill that would eventually pass (1786), proposed to disallow\nstate patronage of any particular religion ([BR]; [Au]:\n31–44). \nJefferson made it clear (TJ to George Wythe, 13 Aug. 1786) that Bill\n79—concerning implementation of wards and ward schools—was\n“the most important bill of our whole code”, as it was the\n“foundation … for the preservation of freedom and\nhappiness” in a true republic. It was the key to engendering the\nsort of reforms needed for Jeffersonian republicanism—reforms\naimed at an educated and thriving citizenry.  \nIt is an axiom in my mind that our liberty can never be safe but in\nthe hands of the people themselves, and that too of the people with a\ncertain degree of education, \nhe says to George Washington (4 Jan. 1786). “Wherever the people\nare well-informed, they can be trusted with their own\ngovernment,” he writes to philosopher Richard Price (8 Jan.\n 1789).[32] \nYet Jefferson’s trust in the people was not unconditional. He\nnever asserted categorically that government for and of the people\nmust, or even can, work. Experience had shown him that governments in\nwhich officials were not elected by and beholden to the people did not\nwork—i.e., they were ultimately unresponsive to the needs of the\npeople—and so he often called republicanism an\n“experiment” or “great experiment” (TJ to John\nAdams, 28 Feb. 1796, and WTJ5: 484). If citizens’ rights were to\nbe respected and defended and if governors were not to govern in their\nown best interest but as stewards f the citizenry, all citizens needed\na basic education—hence, the indispensability of ward-school\neducation. \nGiven two classes of citizens, the laborers and the learned, Jefferson\nrecognized two levels of education ([R]: 459–60). The\nlaborers—divided roughly into husbandmen, manufacturers, and\ncraftsmen—needed to conduct business to sustain and improve\ntheir domestic affairs. Thus, they needed access to primary education.\nThe learned needed access to college-level (Jefferson’s\nintermediary grammar schools) and university-level education. To Peter\nCarr (7 Sept. 1814), Jefferson writes,  \nIt is the duty of [our country’s] functionaries, to provide that\nevery citizen in it should receive an education proportioned to the\nconditions and pursuits of his life. \nNeeds are not all personal. People are, for Jefferson, social\ncreatures, republics are progressive, and thus, citizens have\npolitical duties. Education is critical. “If the condition of\nman is to be progressively ameliorated, as we fondly hope and\nbelieve,” writes Jefferson to the French revolutionary Marc\nAntoine Jullien (6 Oct. 1818), “education is to be the chief\ninstrument in effecting it.” To fit and function in a stable,\nthriving democracy, all citizens are expected to know and assume a\nparticipatory role to the best of their capacities. \nTo promote both fullest political participation and moral progress,\nJefferson realized that educational reform had to be systemic. In a\nletter to Senator Joseph C. Cabell (9 Sept. 1817), Jefferson outlines\nsix features of that system. \nOnly a system could offer all citizens an education proportioned to\ntheir needs: the laborers, a broad, general education; the learned, an\neducation suited to their idiosyncratic needs (Bowers 1943: 243 and\nWalton 1984: 119). Jefferson gets across that point to academician\nGeorge Ticknor (25 Nov. 1817) in the manner of Bacon by limning the\nimportant truths—“that knowledge is power, that knowledge\nis safety, and that knowledge is happiness.” That knowledge is\nuseful, data-driven. \nOverall, observation showed that human capacities were greatly\nunderdeveloped (TJ to William Green Munford, 17 June 1799).\nConsequently, education needed to tap into untapped human potential in\nmorally responsible ways. \nAs well might it be urged that the wild and uncultivated tree,\nhitherto yielding sour and bitter fruit only, can never be made to\nyield better; yet we know that the grafting art implants a new tree on\nthe savage stock, producing what is most estimable both in kind and\ndegree. Education, in like manner, engrafts a new man on the native\nstock, and improves what in his nature was vicious and perverse into\nqualities of virtue and social worth ([R]: 461). \nHuman perfectibility, for Jefferson, was a matter of improved\nefficiency of living, which implied not merely progress in the fields\nof human health and human productivity through discoveries and\nlabor-saving inventions, but also and especially moral improvement.\nMoral improvement was much more important than exercise of rationality\n(e.g., TJ to Maria Cosway, 12 Oct. 1786). Pure rationality was a\nmatter of humans abstracting from reality; moral sensibility was a\nmatter of humans immersed in reality. \nStill Jefferson thought courses in morality were unneeded, if not\ninjurious. “I think it lost time to attend lectures in this\nbranch,” Jefferson writes to Carr (10 Aug. 1787), for moral\nconduct is not a matter of reason. That of course was consistent with\nthe empiricism of his day—e.g., Lord Kames and David Hume.\nNonetheless, Jefferson in Notes on the State of Virginia has\na role for education in moral development. The first stage of\neducation is not the time to encourage critical engagement with\nmaterial like the Bible, for human rationality is not sufficiently\ndeveloped, but instead a time when children should store historical\nfacts to be used critically later in life. While doing so, the\n“elements of morality” can be instilled. Such elements\nteach children, says Jefferson in Aristotelian fashion, that \ntheir own greatest happiness … does not depend on their\ncondition in life in which chance has placed them, but is always the\nresult of a good conscience, good health, occupation [i.e., industry],\nand freedom in all just pursuits ([NV]: 147). \nMoral “learning” is, thus, less a matter of ingesting and\ndigesting moral principles to apply to circumstances—there were\nno inviolable principles for Jefferson, as morality was a matter of\nsensing the right thing to do in circumstances—but of placing\nfaith in the capacity of one’s moral sense to\n“decide” the right course of action without the corruptive\ninfluence of reason or peer pressure (TJ to Martha Jefferson, 11 Dec.\n1783, TJ to Peter Carr, 19 Aug. 1785 and 10 Aug. 1787). \nBecause of the subordination of rationality to morality, education\nmust be useful. It must engender effective, participatory citizenry\nand political stability. Jefferson always insisted on the practicality\nof education, because his take on knowledge was\n Baconian.[33]\n Consider what Jefferson says to scientist and physician Edward Jenner\n(14 May 1806) on behalf of the “whole human family” for\nhis discovery of a vaccine for small pox. \nMedecine has never before produced any single improvement of such\nability. Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood was\na beautiful addition to our knowledge of the animal economy, but on a\nreview of the practice of medicine before & since that epoch, I do\nnot see any great amelioration which has been derived from that\ndiscovery, you have erased from the Calendar of human afflictions one\nof it’s greatest. Yours is the comfortable reflection that\nmankind can never forget that you have lived. \nYet every scientific discovery is potentially fruitful. “No\ndiscovery is barren; it always serves as a step to something\nelse” (TJ to Robert Patterson, 17 Apr. 1803). \n“Useful” for Jefferson was broad and with normative\n implications.[34]\n A complete education for Jefferson would produce men who were \nin all ways useful to society—useful because intelligent,\ncultured, well-informed, technically competent, moral (this\nparticularly), capable of earning a living, happy, and fitted for\npolitical and social leadership (Martin: 37).  \nUseful implied socially and politically active. Male citizens of\ngreatest virtue and greatest genius would contribute by participation\nin science and in the most politically prominent positions. Lesser\ncitizens would contribute more modestly and mostly at local levels\nthrough, for illustration, jury duty, participation in militia, and\nvoting for and overseeing elected representatives. \nFinally, education for Jefferson was a way of living. Its aim was to\ngive persons the tools they would need to make them socially and\npolitically involved, free, self-sufficient, and happy. As Karl\nLehmann (201–2) notes: \nTo Thomas Jefferson, school would never be a ‘finishing’\nagency. From each stage, man would have to move on in a never ending\nprocess of self-education…. The narrow professional who had but\na technical knowledge of his little vocational area was a curse to\nhim. Education had to be broad in order to assure the freedom and\nhappiness of man. \nJefferson’s views on race have been the focus of considerable\ndiscussion in the secondary\n literature.[35]\n Those views, which would be considered today as racist, were likely\ninfluenced by the views of the leading naturalists of his day. In that\nregard, he was the product, not ahead, of his time. \nMost of the discussion of Jefferson’s views on Blacks concerns\nhis Notes on the State of Virginia. In Query XIV, Jefferson\nwrites, “In memory [Blacks] are equal to the whites”\n([NV]: 139). “In reason,” Jefferson says, “[Blacks\nare] much inferior [to Whites], as I think one could scarcely be found\ncapable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of\nEuclid” ([NV]: 139). He adds, “Never yet could I find that\na black had uttered a thought above the level of plain\nnarration” ([NV]: 140). “In imagination [Blacks] are dull,\ntasteless, and anomalous,” and that is evident in their art. In\nmusic, Blacks have accurate ears “for tune and time,” are\ngenerally more gifted than Whites, and are capable of a “small\ncatch,” as illustrated by their talent with the\n“Banjar,” a guitar-like instrument “brought …\nfrom Africa.” “Whether they will be equal to the\ncomposition of a more extensive run of melody, or of complicated\nharmony, is yet to be proved.” Despite their misery, which\n“is often the parent of the most affecting touches of\npoetry,” they have “no poetry” ([NV]: 40–41\nand 288n10). \nInferiority of mind and imagination, he adds, is also confirmed, in\nJefferson’s estimation, by “the improvement of the blacks\nin body and mind, in the first instance of their mixture with the\nwhites,” and that “has been observed by every one, and\nproves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their\ncondition of life” ([NV]: 141). Here he may be referencing\n“observations” in scientific texts of his day in his\nlibrary. \nIn morality, Jefferson admits, Blacks are the equals of all\nothers. \nWe find among them numerous instances of the most rigid integrity, and\nas many as among their better instructed masters, of benevolence,\ngratitude, and unshaken fidelity. \nWhat he takes to be their “disposition to theft,”\nJefferson explains thus: “The man, in whose favour no laws of\nproperty exist, probably feels himself less bound to respect those\nmade in favour of others.” Might not a slave “justifiably\ntake a little from one, who has taken all from him” ([NV]:\n142). \nAll such conclusions, Jefferson says, are provisional: They have the\nconfirmation of observation, but Blacks as well as “red\nmen” hitherto have not been the subjects of natural history. \nThe opinion, that they are inferior in the faculties of reason and\nimagination, must be hazarded with great diffidence. To justify a\ngeneral conclusion, requires many observations, even where the subject\nmay be submitted to the Anatomical knife, to Optical glasses, to\nanalysis by fire or by solvents. How much more then where it is a\nfaculty, not a substance, we are examining; where it eludes the\nresearch of all the senses; where the conditions of its existence are\nvarious and variously combined; where the effects of those which are\npresent or absent bid defiance to calculation; let me add too, as a\ncircumstance of great tenderness, where our conclusion would degrade a\nwhole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings which their\nCreator may perhaps have given them. To our reproach it must be said,\nthat though for a century and a half we have had under our eyes the\nraces of black and of red men, they have never yet been viewed by us\nas subjects of natural history. I advance it therefore as a suspicion\nonly, that the blacks … are inferior to the whites in the\nendowments both of body and mind ([NV]: 143). \nThough he stated that Blacks and Native Americans had not been the\nsubjects of natural history, there was a large body of literature by\nleading naturalists of his day—e.g., Swedish biologist Carl\nLinnaeus ([1758] 1808), Oliver Goldsmith ([1774] 1823), and\n“Georges” Cuvier ([1817] 1831)—to which Jefferson\nhad access and which he doubtless assimilated. That literature viewed\nBlacks and Native Americans as inferior to white Europeans, and the\noverall tendency was to associate darker skin with increased\n inferiority.[36]\n Prominent philosophers like David Hume (1755 [1987]: 208n10), Adam\nSmith (1759 [1982]: 208), and C.F. de Volney in (1802 [2010]: 68) also\nasserted the inferiority of Blacks and Native Americans. \nThis smattering of the “science” of Jefferson’s time\nshows that some of the most esteemed scientists held that Blacks and\nNative Americans, considering each as a race or subspecies of humans,\nwere regarded as inferior or\n defective.[37]\n Jefferson owned and was informed by most of that literature, since he\ntended to be aware of recent developments in all of the sciences. Thus\nJefferson’s “observations” were tainted by the\n“observations” or prejudgments of the authorities of his\nday. Despite his view of them as inferior, he recognized Blacks, as\nmoral equals of all others, had the same rights as all other men. He\nwrites to Bishop Grégoire (25 Feb. 1809): \nWhatever be [Blacks’] degree of talent it is no measure of their\nrights. Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in\nunderstanding, he was not therefore lord of the person or property of\nothers. \nNonetheless, Jefferson’s view of Native Americans was\ninconsistent with those naturalists who viewed them too as a race\ninferior to Europeans, and that requires some explanation. In Query\nXIV of his Notes on the State of Virginia, Jefferson offers a\nbrief analysis of Native Americans as a race. Not having had the\n“advantages” of exposure to European culture that Blacks\nhave had, still Native Americans “often carve figures on their\npipes not destitute of design and merit” ([NV]: 140). Their\ncarvings and drawings “prove the existence of a germ in their\nminds which only wants\n cultivation.”[38]\n He continues, \nThey astonish you with strokes of the most sublime oratory; such as\nprove their reason and sentiment strong, their imagination glowing and\nelevated. ([NV]: 140) \nOne may wonder how much “advantage” Jefferson imagines\nBlacks should demonstrate on account of their exposure to the\n“culture” of their oppressors while enslaved. But\nJefferson maintains that though “most of [the Blacks in America]\nhave been confined to tillage, to their own homes, and their own\nsociety” and have had little direct exposure to sciences and the\narts, \nmany have been so situated, that they might have availed themselves of\nthe conversation of their masters; many have been brought up to the\nhandicraft arts, and from that circumstance have always been\nassociated with the whites. Some have been liberally educated, and all\nhave lived in countries where the arts and sciences are cultivated to\na considerable degree, and have had before their eyes samples of the\nbest works from abroad ([NV]: 139–40). \nThus, Jefferson’s assessment of Blacks differs from his\nassessment of Native Americans. It is unclear whether that difference\nis natural or nurtural. The intimation in  Notes on the State of\nVirginia and in a letter to Edmund Coles (25 Aug. 1814) is\nnatural, though in other letters (e.g., TJ tp Benjamin Banneker, 30\nAug. 1791, and TJ to Bishop Grégoire, 25 Feb. 1809), the\nsuggestion is nurtural, though deficiencies are so pronounced that\nthere can be no rapid change of situation. With Native Americans, the\nscenario is otherwise. \nThere is also a sentiment commonly expressed in the secondary\nliterature (e.g., Risjord 2002: 50–1, and Holowchak 2012,\n243–48) that Jefferson had a personal, or political, interest in\ndefending Native Americans that he did not have for Blacks.\nBuffon—perhaps the greatest naturalist of his day—argued\nthat since the continent of North America was colder and wetter than\nthat of\n Europe,[39]\n its biota, Native Americans included, were inferior ([NV]: 48).\nConsequently, “the savage” was feeble, glabrous,\npassionless, and compared to Europeans, was sexually less potent, less\nsensitive, and more timid, among other things ([NV]: 58). Abbé\nRaynal said more. What was true of Native Americans would eventually\nprove true of any Europeans transplanted in America ([NV]: 64).\nJefferson put considerable effort into refuting Buffon and Raynal\n([NV]: 60–64), which he did, as most scholars concede (e.g.,\nPeden 1954: xxiii), with remarkable success, though his aim was\nfurther, open discussion more than it was refutation ([NV]: 54). \nOne thing seems clear, however. His mistaken views of Blacks and his\nviews of Native Americans shaped his political thinking.\nJefferson’s political vision was of an American nation that was\nwedded to liberty, happiness, and mostly agrarian living, that\ninstantiated irenic republican governance, and that would in time\nserve as a model for other parts of the globe (Holowchak 2017b,\n131–51). That vision, for success, required in his eyes the\nfullest cultivation of genius and morality in the youthful nation\n(McCoy 1980: 136). Native Americans, it seems, passed on both\naccounts. Blacks, however, were to him wanting in genius. Thus, only\nNative Americans could be integrated into the fledgling nation, which\nheld the prospect of covering, as an “empire for liberty,”\nthe North American continent (TJ to James Madison, 27 Apr. 1809) and\nperhaps even the South American continent (TJ to James Madison, 24\nNov. 1801). In Jefferson’s view, Blacks could not be integrated,\nfor any admixture of black blood with white blood would taint the\noffspring, and thereby threaten the success of Jefferson’s\nrepublican experiment. So, every slave would eventually have to be\n“removed beyond the reach of mixture” ([NV]: 137–38\nand 143). Thus, he thought everyone would be best served if Blacks\nwere educated, emancipated, and expatriated; so too would Whites. \nJefferson’s views on race of course have been roundly refuted by\nmodern science, which shows that race biologically is an empty\ncategory. \nWhat, however, of Jefferson’s views and actions on the\nelimination of slavery? \nWe do know that Jefferson consistently spoke out loudly against the\ninstitution of slavery and that, as lawyer and politician, he worked\nhard toward its eradication. He, for instance, undertook six pro\nbono cases on behalf of slaves, seeking freedom, and never\ndefended the rights of a slaveholder. He crafted spirited declamations\nof slavery in his Summary View ([S] 115–16), initial draft of\nthe Declaration of Independence ([Au] 22), his Notes on the State\nof Virginia ([NV]: 162–63), and in several letters. \nNonetheless, he did little in retirement, when he could have tried to\ndo more. \nYet as he matured, Jefferson did little to advance the issue, because\nhe believed that that effort might be more harmful than beneficial.\nThe time, he consistently said, was not right. As early as 1805 (TJ to\nWilliam Burwell, Jan. 28), he expresses skepticism concerning the\neradication of slavery. \nThere are many virtuous men who would make any sacrifices to effect\nit, many equally virtuous who persuade themselves either that the\nthing is not wrong, or that it cannot be remedied, and very many with\nwhom interest is morality [i.e., those who recognize its immorality,\nbut think sympathy is equivalent to action]. The older we grow, the\nlarger we are disposed to believe the last part to be. \nTo Edward Coles (25 Aug. 1814), he writes of the “general\nsilence” on slavery as indicative of public apathy among younger\ngenerations.  \nI have overlived the generation with which mutual labors & perils\nbegat mutual confidence and influence. This enterprise [abolition of\nslavery] is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it\nthrough to its consummation. \nHe even castigates Coles when the latter considers emancipation of his\nown slaves—a precipitous act. \nThe laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their\ngood: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to\nthose whose usage of them we cannot control. I hope then, my dear sir,\nyou will reconcile yourself to your country and its unfortunate\ncondition. \nJefferson’s mistaken views on Blacks and his refusal upon\nretirement to do more to eliminate the institution of slavery have\nprompted considerable critical discussion in the secondary literature\n(see fn. 38). On the one hand, most see Jefferson as racist. McColley\n(1964), Cohen (1969), Miller (1977), and Dawidoff (1993) argue that\nJefferson’s racial views were hypocritical rationalizations for\nhis slaveholding and large living. Finkelman (1994), O’Brien\n(1996), and Magnis (1999) state that Jefferson was driven by a\nprofound hatred of Blacks. On the other hand, Levy (1963), Mayer\n(2001), Burstein (2005), and Holowchak (2013b and 2020a) argue that\nthough Jefferson held false views concerning Blacks, it is\nanachronistic to call him a racist, as ignorance concerning racial\ndifferences by commoners and scientists was at the time rife.\nJefferson, ultimately, was a product of the ignorance and prejudgments\nof his time.","contact.mail":"mholowchak@hotmail.com","contact.domain":"hotmail.com"}]
