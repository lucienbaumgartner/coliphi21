Adams","author1.info":"http://marcuspadams.wordpress.com/","entry":"hobbes-science","body.text":"\n\n\nThomas Hobbes is rightly regarded as a monumental figure in the\nhistory of philosophy, especially for his masterpiece\nLeviathan (1651 in English; 1668 in Latin). The scholarly\nliterature on Leviathan is voluminous and has been especially\nfocused upon issues in political philosophy, such as representation\nand authorization, sovereignty and absolutism, contracts and\ncovenants, and the relationship of civil authority to religion, among\nothers. Since its printing the portrayal in Leviathan XIII of\nhumans in their natural state—an existence that is\n“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”—has\nstruck the imagination of many of Hobbes’ readers, leaving many\nseeing Hobbes as pessimistic at best or hopelessly unrealistic at\nworst.\n\n\nIn Hobbes’ own time, however, he was also well-known, even if\nsometimes ridiculed, for his views in mathematics, natural philosophy,\nand optics. In A Minute or First Draught of the Optiques\n(1646), Hobbes’ own assessment of his work is laudatory:\n\n\n\n\n…I shall deserve the Reputation of having been the first to lay\nthe ground of two Sciences, this of Opticques, the most curious, and\nthat other of natural Justice, which I have done in my book de Cive,\nthe most profitable of all other. (Hobbes 1646 [1983: 622])\n\n\n\nAlthough some contemporaries saw promise in Hobbes’ optics, such\nas Mersenne, who published Hobbes’ work in this area in 1644 in\nBallistica, in the years following the publication of\nLeviathan Hobbes’ pursuits apart from political\nphilosophy were taken less seriously. There are a number of possible\nexplanations for this decline in the opinion of Hobbes’\ncompetence in these areas, including his numerous attempts to square\nthe circle, the association of his views with atheism by many critics,\nand the conflicts he had with Robert Boyle at the time of the rise of\nexperimental philosophy. These all contributed to some extent to\nHobbes’ exclusion from the Royal Society when it was\nfounded.\n\n\nIf Hobbes’ mathematical and natural-philosophical endeavors\nfailed to be taken seriously by his contemporaries near the end of his\nlife, what purpose is served by understanding these failed\n attempts?[1]\n Apart from interest in them on their own terms as episodes in the\nhistory of science and philosophy, there are several reasons why we\nmay find these areas of Hobbes’ thought valuable for study.\nFirst, Hobbes himself understood his political philosophy, or as he\ncalled it “civil philosophy”, to be a science capable of\ndemonstration. Thus, understanding his general views about the nature\nof scientific demonstration promises to shed light on the way in which\nhe saw civil philosophy as scientific. Second, Hobbes understood\nnatural-philosophical explanations in physics as needing to make use\nof mathematical principles to count, as he says, as “true\nphysics”. This may seem like a banal claim to a twenty-first\ncentury reader, but it was not so to many in the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries. Hobbes’ natural philosophy thus situates\nhim within the shift from qualitative to quantitative physics. Third,\nHobbes’ conflicts with the Royal Society show us not only his\nviews of the role of experimentation but also contextualize the rise\nof experimentalism. After discussing Hobbes’ criteria for\nscientific knowledge, this entry will address each of these three\nareas.\n\nThe fundamental aspects of Hobbes’ materialism are well known.\nHobbes believed that everything that exists is a body, and that bodies\nare sometimes in motion and sometimes at rest. Furthermore, he held\nthat the only essential property of body is extension, or magnitude.\nAll other apparent properties of bodies, such as those of color,\ntaste, and firmness, are the result of motions from bodies being\ncontinued through media to humans’ sense organs. These motions,\nwhen continued into the bodies of perceivers, are constitutive of\nconceptions, or\n ideas.[2]\n Ideas of the objects of sense are caused by motions from things\noutside of perceivers and those continued motions constitute ideas and\nserve to individuate one idea from another. Thus, all ideas in the\nhuman mind are either from sense perception or derived from ideas\ngained from sense perception (Leviathan I; LEV 22). \nThis account of the origin and nature of ideas shows Hobbes’\nclear empiricist leanings; however, Hobbes does not hold that knowers\nshould uncritically accept what the ideas of sense objects seem to\nrepresent. Like many other philosophers in the seventeenth century,\nHobbes held that our knowledge of the external world was not direct\nbut was instead mediated by ideas. This recognition that “we\ncompute nothing but our phantasms or ideas” (Hobbes\n1642–43 [1973: 450]; cf. OL\n I.82)[3]\n resulted in two worries about human knowledge. \nFirst, knowers must examine what resemblance ideas in the mind have to\nobjects in the outside world. This worry seems similar, at first\nglance, to the concerns of Descartes’ meditator in the\nMeditations on First Philosophy (1641), but Hobbes aimed to\nprovide a solution that made no reference whatsoever to God or to\nanything at all immaterial, such as a soul. In the early work\nElements of Law, composed in 1640 and published in 1650 (EL),\nHobbes offered arguments that attempted to show that ideas are\ndistinct from that which they purport to represent and he claimed that\nas a result we could know that the so-called secondary qualities, such\nas color, taste, and sound, were not in bodies. To do this, he used\neveryday experience to provide evidence for his claims:  \nEvery man hath so much experience as to have seen the sun and other\nvisible objects by reflection in the water and in glasses, and this\nalone is sufficient for this conclusion: that colour and image may be\nthere where the thing seen is not. (Elements of Law II.5; EL\n3)  \nHe used similar considerations in Leviathan I, concluding\nthat we can know, for example, that color and sound are not in bodies\nsince if they were “they could not bee severed from them, as by\nglasses, and in Ecchoes by reflection” (LEV 24). \nA second worry that follows from Hobbes’ view that we have only\nmediated access to bodies in the world relates to the possibility of\ngaining knowledge of the causes of natural events. Most of the ideas\nthat knowers possess of bodies are received passively. When interested\nin the cause of some phenomenon, all one may examine are ideas caused\nby the motions of the bodies involved. However, when interested in,\nsay, the cause of billiard ball B being put into motion after\napparent contact with moving billiard ball A, one does not find\nan idea of A being the cause of B’s motion. Even\nif one were to look to a lower ‘level’, as it were,\nsmaller than billiard balls by use of a microscope, one would not find\nany idea of A’s motion causing B’s motion. Hobbes\ndiagnosed this lack of causal knowledge by highlighting that human\nagents are not the makers of natural phenomena. He seemed to think\nthat makers gain this causal knowledge by attending to their\nconstructions through the process of creating. Since we lack the ideas\nof the causes of individual phenomena from our experience, Hobbes\nclaimed that we cannot know their actual causes at all. All that we\nmay know are possible causes. Hobbes asserted in Six Lessons to\nthe Professors of Mathematiques (1656) that because “of\nnatural bodies we know not the construction but seek it from the\neffects” we can know “only of what [the causes] may\nbe” (EW VII.184). \nThis second worry brings to the fore Hobbes’ condition for the\npossibility of scientific knowledge, namely, the possession of\n(actual) causal knowledge. He claimed that  \nwe are said to know [scire] some effect when we know what its\ncauses are, in what subject they are, in what subject they introduce\nthe effect and how they do it. Therefore, this is the knowledge\n[scientia] τοῦ\nδιότι or of causes. (OL I.59)  \nHaving scientific knowledge required one to know the actual causes of\na phenomenon, not its mere possible causes. However, the only way to\npossess such causal knowledge is to act as a maker, as God did in the\ncase of natural things. \nThis restriction that Hobbes made allowed him to consider only\ngeometry and civil philosophy as bodies of scientific knowledge, since\nin only these two disciplines do humans make the objects that they\nstudy. In Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematiques,\nHobbes distinguished these two disciplines from all others by\nconnecting them to making:  \nGeometry therefore is demonstrable for the lines and figures from\nwhich we reason are drawn and described by ourselves and civil\nphilosophy is demonstrable because we make the commonwealth ourselves.\n(EW VII.184) \nIn the three following sections, this entry will consider ways in\nwhich these two bodies of scientific knowledge are used within other\ndisciplines to provide an epistemic grounding for the explanations\ntherein. In natural philosophy, or physics, Hobbes borrowed\ngeometrical principles to provide the cause—the reason\n‘why’—for many phenomena, while the making of the\ncommonwealth, and its laws, out of the state of nature was the genesis\nof civil philosophy. \nThere has been debate among scholars of Hobbes’ thought about\nthe relationship of the different parts of his philosophy to one\nanother. Much of the focus has been upon the methodological statements\nin Part I of De Corpore, and scholars have traditionally\ndivided over whether Hobbes understood philosophy as unified or\ndisunified. However, more recent scholarship has drawn attention to\nHobbes’ practice of explanation, such as the explanations found\nin De Corpore Part IV, and has argued that aspects of both\nthe unified and disunified views track Hobbes’ discussions and\npractice while those views on their own miss that Hobbes explicitly\nborrowed principles from mathematics to use in natural philosophy (and\nprovided citations to show this activity). This section will discuss\nthese three approaches to understanding how the parts of Hobbes’\nsystem fit with one another and then provide an example of an\nexplanation in Hobbes’ natural philosophy from De\nCorpore XXV. \nFirst, the unified view. A significant number of scholars have argued\nthat Hobbes understood his philosophy as unified by deductive\nconnections between the different parts (for example, Martinich 2005;\nPeters 1967; Shapin & Schaffer 1985; Watkins 1965). A stronger\nversion of this unified view understands Hobbes to be a type of\nreductionist, wherein descriptions of macroscopic bodies, such as\nhumans and rocks, ultimately reduce to microscopic bodies responsible\nfor all phenomena (for example, Hampton 1986; Ryan 1970). For example, Alan\nRyan articulates the reductionist view as follows: \nHobbes believed as firmly as one could that all behaviour, whether of\nanimate or inanimate matter, was ultimately to be explained in terms\nof particulate motion: the laws governing the motions of discrete\nmaterial particles were the ultimate laws of the universe, and in this\nsense psychology must be rooted in physiology and physiology in\nphysics, while the social sciences, especially the technology of\nstatecraft, must be rooted in psychology. (1970: 102–103) \nThere is some textual support for understanding the parts of\nHobbes’ system as either deductively or reductively linked\ntogether since he did at times talk of the parts of philosophy as\nbeginning in first philosophy and leading from one to another. For\nexample, he asserted in De Corpore VI.6 that by beginning at\nfirst principles, one will move from first philosophy to geometry, and\nfrom geometry to physics. He continued by claiming that “after\nphysics we come to morals” and, indeed, Hobbes claims that moral\nphilosophy must be studied after physics because the passions have\n“their causes in sense-experience and imagination” (CSL\n299; OL I.64). \nHowever, immediately following these statements that seem to indicate\nthat Hobbes took his philosophy to be tightly knit together, he argued\nthat “civil and moral philosophy do not so adhere to one\nanother, but that they may be severed” (EW I.73). This\nseparation is permissible, Hobbes claimed, because in addition to\nlearning moral philosophy from first principles each individual could\nsimply study the motions of their own mind and gain knowledge of the\nsame principles. That such separation could occur is difficult to\nexplain for a strong version of the unified view because it makes\nit appear that Hobbes thought that one could develop civil philosophy\nsimply by introspecting, entirely independently of any work in moral\nphilosophy, natural philosophy, and first philosophy. \nA further difficulty for the unified view is that even if Hobbes did\nsee the connection between, say, physics and moral philosophy as\ndeductive, it is not obvious how that deduction would work because\nmoral philosophy must add content about human passions (endeavors)\nthat is not contained within—and thus not deducible\nfrom—physics. For example, although the concept\n‘endeavor’ is introduced in physics, for it to be used in\nmoral philosophy the concepts of ‘appetite’ and\n‘aversion’, which are properties of human bodies, must be\nadded to it for use (Malcolm 2002: 147). One way to avoid this\ndifficulty for the unified view would be to provide evidence that\nHobbes made explicit the reduction relationship between concepts like\n‘appetite’ and ‘aversion’ and the concept of\n‘endeavour’, showing how one can reduce claims about human\nbodies to claims about microscopic bodies. Hobbes does not appear to\ndo this anywhere in the corpus. However, even if a strong version of\nthe unified view faces this difficulty, the presence of\n‘endeavor’ throughout Hobbes’ philosophy shows that\nit was a foundational concept (see Jesseph 2016). \nThe second major view of the relationship of the parts of\nHobbes’ philosophy to one another is what we can call the\ndisunified view (for example, see Robertson 1886; Taylor 1938;\nWarrender 1957). Some of the motivation behind the disunified account\nseems to be a desire to free Hobbes from what is prima facie a case of\nderiving normative claims relating to the commonwealth in civil\nphilosophy from descriptive claims related to human psychology and,\nultimately, more general claims in natural philosophy (especially\nTaylor 1938). However, in its attempts to rescue Hobbes from a version\nof the so-called naturalistic fallacy, the disunified account fails to\ntake seriously Hobbes’ claims about the unity of his philosophy.\nFurthermore, it neglects that many of Hobbes’ contemporaries\n(for example, Bramhall) saw Hobbes’ views in natural philosophy\nas having far-reaching consequences for other areas of philosophy. \nA third view has more recently been offered that seeks to carve a\nmiddle path between the unified and disunified interpretations. We can\ncall this view the mixed-mathematics view (for example, Adams 2016,\n2017; Biener 2016). This understanding of Hobbes’ system agrees\nwith the worry raised above for the unified account that\n‘higher’ levels, such as geometry, do not contain the\nconcepts used in ‘lower’ level explanations. For example,\nalthough geometrical principles are used in Hobbes’ optical\nexplanations those geometrical principles do not contain concepts such\nas ‘light’ or ‘color’. Some evidence for this\nlack of containment claim can be found on the well-known “Table\nof the Several Subjects of Science” in Leviathan IX.\nThe “sciences” on this table are listed on the right-most\nsection and their subjects are to the immediate left. The subject of\nthe science of optics, for example, is all of the “consequences\nfrom vision”, and these stem from “Physics or consequences\nfrom qualities”. The science of geometry, however, has as its\nsubject the “consequences from quantity, and motion\ndetermined… by figure” and these stem not from physics\nbut from “consequences from the accidents common to all bodies\nnatural; which are quantity and motion”. \nInstead of seeing this “adding to” as evidence for the\ndisunified view, the mixed-mathematics view understands Hobbes having\nseen certain disciplines as providing causal principles (what he\ncalled the ‘why’) while other disciplines provided the\nfacts relevant to a given domain (what he called the\n‘that’). Textual support for this understanding of\nHobbes’ system can be found in Hobbes’ methodological\nstatements about natural philosophy as well as in his practice of\nexplanation. \nAs mentioned already, Hobbes identified scientific knowledge\n(scientia) with knowing causes, and in his discussions he\nused language germane to Aristotle’s distinction between the\n‘why’ and the ‘that’. We have seen already\nHobbes’ commitment to knowing through the causes, but the\ncomplete passage from De Corpore VI.1 provides further detail\nabout Hobbes’ views on the two types of knowledge, as\nfollows: \nWe are said to know [scire] some effect when we know what its\ncauses are, in what subject they are, in what subject they introduce\nthe effect and how they do it. Therefore, this is the knowledge\n[scientia] τοῦ\nδιότι or of causes. All other knowledge\n[cognitio], which is called τοῦ\nὅτι, is either sense experience or imagination\nremaining in sense experience or memory (De Corpore VI.1; CSL\n287–289). \nTwo types of knowledge thus emerge. There is knowledge from sense\nexperience, retained as imagination and eventually as memory, and\nthere is scientific knowledge. When reflecting in De Homine\non the status of claims in physics, Hobbes claims that what he calls\n“true physics” must be a mixture of both of these types of\nknowledge: \n[…] since one cannot proceed in reasoning about natural things\nthat are brought about by motion from the effects to the causes\nwithout a knowledge of those things that follow from that kind of\nmotion; and since one cannot proceed to the consequences of motions\nwithout a knowledge of quantity, which is geometry; nothing can be\ndemonstrated by physics without something also being demonstrated\na priori. Therefore physics (I mean true physics) [vera\nphysica], that depends on geometry, is usually numbered among the\nmixed mathematics [mathematicas mixtas]. [.] Therefore those\nmathematics are pure which (like geometry and arithmetic) revolve\naround quantities in the abstract so that work [in them] requires no\nknowledge of the subject; those mathematics are mixed, in truth, which\nin their reasoning some quality of the subject is also considered, as\nis the case with astronomy, music, physics, and the parts of physics\nthat can vary on account of the variety of species and the parts of\nthe universe. (MC 42; OL II.93) \nThese two statements concerning the status of different types of\nknowledge and the requirement to mix “quantities in the\nabstract” with “some quality of the subject” in\nphysics can aid in making sense of Hobbes’ actual explanatory\npractice. What does it mean for physics to be “mixed\nmathematics”? For Hobbes it means that for many explanations one\nwill first establish that some fact is the case by appealing to sense\nexperience, but to give the reason why one must borrow a principle\nfrom geometry. \nAt several places in De Corpore, Hobbes appears to carry out\nthe mixed-mathematics ideal by showing, with a citation, that he used\na causal principle from geometry within an explanation that included\ndetails about the “quality of the subject”. For example,\nin De Corpore XXV, the chapter with which Hobbes began Part\nIV, Hobbes appears to have done just this when he explained sensation.\nIn that explanation, he appealed both to “qualities of the\nsubject”, such as the claim based upon experience that “we\nmay observe… that our phantasms or ideas are not always the\nsame” (EW I.389), and by citing and using causal principles from\nearlier in the work (see discussion of this explanation in Adams\n 2016).[4] \nSuch behavior—borrowing and citing a principle within an\nexplanation—would be difficult to explain on the picture offered\nby the unified view since Hobbes offers no justification for this\npractice other than phrases such as “I have shown\nbesides…”. There is no deduction anywhere offered within\nHobbes’ actual explanatory practice that would give reason to\nthink that Hobbes understood the use of these principles from\nelsewhere in the work in that way. Likewise, it is difficult to make\nsense of this activity within Hobbes’ actual practice if we\nadopt the disunified view of Hobbes’ philosophy, since by using\nprinciples from elsewhere in the system, and especially by explicitly\nciting them, Hobbes is signaling that the parts of his system did fit\ntogether, even if not in the strong reductive sense of the unified\nview. The next section will describe Hobbes’ view that work in\nfirst philosophy and geometry must be done prior to experiments. \nHobbes’ conflict with Robert Boyle concerning the nature of\nnatural philosophy in general, and the air-pump experiments in\nparticular, took place over several years and in a series of\n publications.[5]\n Hobbes wrote Dialogus Physicus (1661; a second version\nappeared in\n 1668)[6]\n as a dialogue aimed at criticizing Boyle’s New Experiments\nPhysico-Mechanical (1660). Boyle responded to various criticisms\nin works such as An Examen of Mr. T. Hobbes his Dialogus Physicus\nde Natura Aëris (1662), An Examen of Mr. Hobbes’\nDoctrine about Cold (1665), and Animadversions upon Mr.\nHobbes’ Problemata de Vacuo (1674). The most comprehensive\nand influential treatment of this period of Hobbes’ life is\nShapin and Schaffer’s Leviathan and the Air-Pump\n (1985).[7]\n This section will focus upon Hobbes’ criticisms of the air-pump\nexperiments in the Dialogus Physicus with an aim of showing\nhow they illuminate our understanding of Hobbes’ natural\nphilosophy. \nMost generally both Boyle and Hobbes viewed the natural world as\ncomposed of bits of matter in motion. Even if there were some points\nof agreement between the versions of mechanical philosophy offered by\nboth Boyle and\n Hobbes,[8]\n there are important differences. A crucial difference between the two\nrelates to the status (or lack thereof) of Laws of Nature. While Boyle\ntalked about the laws of nature as established by God (see entry on\n Boyle, section Laws of Nature),\n Hobbes restricted discussion of laws to the laws of human conduct\ndiscovered by those who escape the state of nature and create a\ncommonwealth. In contrast to laws of the natural world, Hobbes\narticulated a priori principles of motion at the foundation\nof his physics in De Corpore VIII.19 and IX.7. Rather than\nbeing known as laws of motion, issued by some divine lawmaker, these\nHobbesian principles of motion are explicated by thought experiments\nand seem to rely upon a version of the principle of sufficient reason\n(Jesseph 2006: 132). Although Hobbes held that they were true of all\nhuman experience, since Hobbes holds that we cannot know the actual\ncauses of natural phenomena he would have to admit that nature might,\nunbeknownst to us, act otherwise. However, despite these differences,\nthe primary dissimilarity that emerges between Hobbes and Boyle\nconcerning the air-pump experiments is one of method as it relates to\nthe status of experiments/experience (see entry on\n Boyle, section Philosophy of Experiment). \nGiven that Hobbes was convinced of the impossibility of knowing the\nactual causes of natural phenomena, he held that any phenomenon admits\nof multiple possible explanations. This should not be taken to imply\nthat Hobbes saw all explanations, and thus all possible causes or\nsuppositions, as standing on equal footing. Instead, Hobbes held that\nwork in first philosophy and geometry must be completed prior to\nattempting to make any explanations in natural philosophy. This seems\nto be what Hobbes meant when he said that “nothing can be\ndemonstrated by physics without something also being demonstrated\na priori” (MC 42; OL II.93). When giving an\nexplanation, Hobbes held that one should ideally appeal to those\ncauses that are demonstrable from geometry when mixed with facts and\nrule out those that are not intelligible according to geometrical\nprinciples. \nIn contrast, Boyle’s method prescribed that instead of bringing\ncausal principles to an experiment and expecting to explain some\nphenomenon by appeal to those principles, one should attempt to arrive\nat a supposition that would explain a phenomenon only after repeated,\ncareful experiments. Thomas Sprat detailed the care taken in the design\nof experiments and the manner in which Royal Society members were\nformed into committees that shared parts of an experiment so that\n“[b]y this union of eyes, and hands” they were able to\ngain “a full comprehension of the object in all its\nappearances” (Sprat 1667: 85). \nWe can make sense of Hobbes’ direct criticisms of Boyle’s\nprioritization of experiment with this methodological difference in\nmind. Hobbes’ view of the foundational role played by first\nphilosophy and mathematics over experiment/experience is clear when he\nclaimed in Dialogus Physicus that  \n…ingenuity is one thing and method is another. Here method is\nneeded. The causes of those things done by motion are to be\ninvestigated through a knowledge of motion, the knowledge of which,\nthe noblest part of geometry, is hitherto untouched. (DP 347; OL IV.236)\n \nAccording to Hobbes, then, one must have geometrical principles\nalready in place to aid in choosing a supposition before engaging in\nexperiments. Unlike the Royal Society’s aim to have multiple\nmembers examine the same object, Hobbes emphasized the need for\nindividual conceptual clarity, something that could be accomplished\nfrom an armchair. \nThis criticism from Hobbes, and Boyle’s rebuttals relying upon\nevidence from experiments, could be seen as a conflict of\nBoyle’s experimental natural philosophy against a form of\nspeculative natural\n philosophy.[9]\n However, it is important to avoid taking Hobbes’ criticisms of\nBoyle’s method to imply that Hobbes completely eschewed\nexperiment/experience while engaging in natural-philosophical\nexplanations. Instead, Hobbes viewed experiment/experience as playing\nthe role of establishing that some phenomenon occurs, what we have\nseen he called the ‘that’, but one should never hope,\naccording to Hobbes, to glean a possible cause from mere observations,\neven if those observations were carefully documented and repeated many\ntimes. \nIndeed, in the Dialogus Physicus Hobbes, speaking through\nspeaker A, often granted the observational reports of the\nexperimenters without question. For example, speaker A does not\nquestion what the experimenters claim they observed regarding a\nbladder that had been placed inside the air-pump and weighed, noting\n“They can be certain that the scale in which the bladder is, is\nmore depressed than the other, their eyes bearing witness” (DP\n369; OL IV.261). Instead of criticizing the experimenters’\nreliance upon observations, speaker A argues that the experimenters\ncannot know, in the case of this explanation, what the cause of the\nscale being depressed is because their posited cause (the\n“natural gravity” of the air) does not allow them to\nexplain why the scale is depressed after the air-pump is engaged. In\ncontrast, speaker A offers a possible cause that is borrowed, with an\nexplicit citation, from Hobbes’ geometrical account of\n“simple circle motion” and “fermentation”\ndeveloped in De Corpore 21.5 (Adams 2017). \nHobbes thought that he would be renowned as the founder of civil\nphilosophy just as he saw Copernicus as having initiated the\n“beginning of astronomy”, Galileo as having opened the\n“gate of natural philosophy universal” with an account of\nthe “nature of motion”, and William Harvey as having first\ndiscovered the “science of man’s body” (see the\ndedicatory epistle to De Corpore; EW I.viii). He asserted\nthat while “Natural Philosophy is… young”, civil\nphilosophy itself is “no older than… [his] own book De\nCive” (EW I.ix). As a student of historical texts in their\noriginal\n languages,[10]\n Hobbes was well aware of many works from antiquity to his own time\naddressing issues relevant to civil philosophy. By claiming civil\nphilosophy was his invention, he intended to deny that any of those\npreceding works counted as philosophy. \nWhat did Hobbes see as distinguishing his work in civil philosophy\nfrom all predecessors? As points of contrast, Hobbes mentioned the\nSophists who “taught … [only how] to dispute” and\nChristian theologians who introduced “school divinity”, by\nwhich Hobbes meant the blending of teachings from Scripture with\nAristotle’s philosophy. For the latter, Hobbes saw the best\n“exorcism” to be the distinction between the subject\nmatters of religion, which were the “rules for honouring\nGod”, and philosophy, which was concerned with the\n“opinions of private men” (EW I.xi). What distinguished\nreligion from philosophy in this sense, Hobbes continued, is that\nphilosophy provides either demonstrations from definitions or\ndemonstrations from “suppositions not absurd”. \nSo far it seems that there are two criteria relevant to civil\nphilosophy that Hobbes saw as setting his apart from all other\nattempts. First, Hobbesian civil philosophy is a science\n(scientia) because human makers have the ability to know the\nactual causes of the objects of study since they construct them.\nSecond, to count as philosophy and not mere superstition or sophistry,\nHobbesian civil philosophy must provide demonstrations. \nHow exactly Hobbes’ use of ‘demonstration’ should be\nunderstood as it relates to civil philosophy has been a subject of\ndebate among Hobbes scholars over the past several decades. Much of\nthe focus of this debate has been concerning the Laws of Nature in\nLeviathan XIV and XV. Why restrict the scope of demonstrable\ncivil philosophy to two chapters of Leviathan? Why not\ninclude, for example, Leviathan Parts III (“Of A\nChristian Commonwealth”) and IV (“Of The Kingdom of\nDarkness”)? Alternatively, why not also include chapters from\nPart II (“Of Commonwealth”), especially chapter XVII\n(“Of the Causes, Generation, and Definition of a\nCommonwealth”)? One motivation for focus upon chapters XIV and\nXV is that in those chapters Hobbes seems to have indicated that he\nsaw a deductive relationship between the laws of nature by using the\nlanguage one might expect in a demonstration. For example, Hobbes\ndescribed the second law of nature as being “derived from”\nthe first law (LEV 200). The remainder of this section will focus on\ntwo ways of understanding Hobbes’ civil philosophy as a\ndemonstration. \nOne way of understanding Hobbes’ claim that civil philosophy is\ndemonstrable connects it to Euclidean geometry. This view has been\ncalled the “definitivist” or “definitional”\nview because of its emphasis on the importance of definitions in\nHobbes’ philosophy. One articulation of the definitivist view\nunderstands Hobbes’ definition of ‘law of nature’ in\nLeviathan as playing a role similar to an axiom in Euclidean\ngeometry (Deigh 1996). In Leviathan XIV, a law of nature is\ndefined as  \na Precept, or generall Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is\nforbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh\naway the means of preserving the same; and to omit, that, by which he\nthinketh it may be best preserved. (LEV 198) \nThe definivist further claims that like Euclidean axioms Hobbes did\nnot view this axiom—the definition of ‘law of\nnature’—as requiring demonstration; instead, he derived\nthe first law of nature from it and then derived the others one from\nanother. Why is Hobbesian civil philosophy a demonstrable science on\nthis view? Simply put, it is a demonstrable science because it follows\nthe method of Euclidean geometry, viewed by Hobbes and others as the\nmodel of scientific knowledge on account of its clarity and\n rigor.[11] \nA virtue of the definitivist view is that it takes seriously\nHobbes’ claim that civil philosophy is demonstrable. However, a\ndifficulty faced by the definitivist view, along with any other that\nunderstands Hobbes as drawing inspiration from Euclid, is that Hobbes\nhimself harshly criticized Euclidean definitions, arguing that\nEuclid’s definitions “ought not be numbered among the\nprinciples of geometry” because they did not contain the causes\nof what was to be constructed (EW VII.184). Furthermore, Hobbes\ncriticized the nature of the objects of Euclidean geometry. For\nexample, Hobbes argued against understanding lines as being without\nbreadth since there are no such bodies in nature (EW VII.202).\nAdditionally, Hobbes himself did not ground his own geometry in\nundemonstrated axioms and held that even Euclidean axioms needed to be\ndemonstrated (OL I.72; OL I.119). \nA second difficulty for the definitivist view lies in its inability to\naccommodate the laws of nature as commands (Hoekstra 2003: 115). If\nthe laws of nature were derived from the definition of ‘law of\nnature’, it would be difficult to see how they could then take\nthe form of instructions to perform some action. Indeed, the laws of\nnature take the form of instructions to do this or that, such as the\nfirst law of nature  \nThat every man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has of\nobtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use,\nall helps, and advantages of Warre. (LEV 200)  \nBeyond the first and second laws of nature, the remaining laws contain\ninstructions concerning what should be done to accomplish peace, that\nis, they command it, such as the third law of nature which commands\n“That men performe their Covenants made” (LEV 220). \nAn alternative account, what has been called the “maker’s\nknowledge” view of Hobbes’ civil philosophy, attempts to\nconnect Hobbes’ demonstrations and definitions in geometry with\ncivil philosophy. This view avoids the two difficulties faced by the\ndefinitivist account mentioned above and holds that Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy is demonstrable by appealing to Hobbes’ own\nunderstanding of what constitutes a demonstration (Adams 2019). The\nremainder of this section will discuss two features of the\n“maker’s knowledge” account of Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy. \nFirst, a requirement for geometrical definitions, which Hobbes\nstressed in multiple contexts, is that they must provide the causes of\nthe things being defined. For example, Hobbes claimed that the\ndefinition of ‘line’ should be as follows: “a line\nis made by the motion of a point” (OL I.63). Likewise, a plane\nis made by the motion of a line. Perhaps Hobbes understood all of the\nlaws of nature to be like this type of geometrical definition, but\ninstead of the definition of something like ‘line’ they\nserved as the definition of (and thus how to make) peace. That is,\nwhen following all of the laws of nature one could make peace just as\nby following the generative instructions contained in the definition\nof ‘line’ one could make a line. \nSecond, a demonstration for Hobbes did not involve the derivation of\nfeatures by means of deduction. Such deductions would provide one with\nknowledge of what was already contained in the starting proposition,\nmaking it difficult to see how commands could be derived from the\ndefinition of ‘law of nature’ in Leviathan XIV.\nHowever, Hobbes explicitly said that demonstrations should be\nsynthetic, wherein one builds the complex thing to be demonstrated out\nof simpler constituent parts. A demonstration, Hobbes asserted, should\nbe understood as a showing of some construction to someone else (OL\nI.76) and, as a result, he claimed that “entire method of\ndemonstrating is synthetic” (OL I.71). By\n‘synthesis’ Hobbes means that one shows how something is\nput together to reach the desired end, one shows how that thing is\nmade. \nThe maker’s knowledge view of Hobbes’ civil philosophy\ndraws insight from these two points and understands Hobbesian civil\nphilosophy as demonstrable in the following way. Hobbes begins civil\nphilosophy at a starting point in the “natural condition”\nof human bodies in Leviathan XIII, continues by considering\nhow those bodies could be moved (by commands in the laws of nature) in\nways that would be conducive of peace and, finally, are brought\ntogether to compose the commonwealth.","contact.mail":"madams2@albany.edu","contact.domain":"albany.edu"}]
