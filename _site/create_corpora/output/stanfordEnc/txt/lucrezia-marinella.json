Her work,\nLa nobiltà et l’eccellenza delle donne, co’\ndifetti et mancamenti de gli uomini, (The Nobility and\nExcellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men), published\nin 1600, was one of the first polemical treatises written by a woman\nin Italian as part of an ongoing debate about the nature and worth of\nwomen, often called the querelle des femmes (the debate about\n women).[1]The Nobility and Excellence of Women is an erudite\nrecapitulation of the arguments and evidence brought forward to\nsupport claims for the merits of women, but it is more than a summary.\nMarinella provides a cogent, extended argument for the superiority of\nwomen’s intellectual and moral capacities, effectively\nconstructing an account of a nature proper to women and distinct from\nthe nature of man.\n\n\nThe Nobility and Excellence of Women is remarkable in several\nrespects, aside from its philosophical and rhetorical skill. First,\nalthough several of Marinella’s predecessors on the pro-woman\nside of the debate had argued both that men and women were equal in so\nfar as they shared a rational soul, and also that women were superior,\nthey had failed to address adequately the tension between the claims\nof equality and of superiority; Marinella addresses it directly and\npersuasively. Her argument takes the bodies of women as a starting\npoint, from which she adduces evidence to demonstrate that\nwomen’s moral characters are better than those of men, and that\nthe moral superiority of women leads to an intellectual superiority.\nSecond, Marinella advances the case being made by women and their\nsupporters beyond a demand for sympathy and respect from men to a\ndemand for freedom, power, and equality (Cox 1995, 520). Although she\ndid not propose concrete reforms, she did analyze the situation of\nwomen in explicitly political terms. Third, although many had decried\nthe viciousness of those who argued for the inferiority of women,\nMarinella was one of the first to supply an explanation of the motives\nof men who published misogynist works, and to connect those motives to\nthe exclusion of women from public life (Jordan 1990, 259; Cox 1995,\n516).\n\nLucrezia Marinella was born in Venice in 1571, and lived there until\nher death in 1653. Her father, Giovanni Marinelli, was a physician,\nand the author of a number of medical treatises, two of which\nconcerned women. He encouraged her intellectual interests, and allowed\nher access to biological and medical works, as well as works of\nphilosophy (natural and moral) and literature. She was thus able to\nobtain a good education. Marinella composed works in a number of\ndifferent genres, including lyric and narrative poetry, and devotional\nliterature, but her skill as a philosophical polemicist demonstrated\ndirect knowledge of the classical literary tradition and training in\nrhetoric and dialectic, all of which were unusual among women at the\ntime (Panizza and Wood 2000, 65). Marinella’s first published\nwork appeared in 1595; her most important work, the treatise entitled\nThe Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of\nMen (hereafter The Nobility) was published in Venice in\n1600, revised and expanded in 1601, and reprinted in 1620. She\ncontinued writing and publishing until her death. \nMarinella married another physician, Girolomo Vacca, relatively late\nin life. In the sixteenth century political and economic conditions in\nVenice, and their impact on marriage opportunities, gave women more\nliberty, which may have favored feminist polemics (see Cox 1995). In\nthat context, Marinella’s late marriage may have afforded her\ngreater opportunities for education and a measure of independence.\nThere is some evidence that she was accepted as part of a group of\nintellectuals who formed the second Venetian academy, and that the\nacademy supported and encouraged the expression of her feminist ideas\n(Kolsky 2001, 976). Marinella was commissioned to write The\nNobility, either by Lucio Scarano, to whom it is dedicated (also\na physician, and a philosopher) or by its publisher, Giovanni Battista\nCiotti (Kolsky 2001, 975; Ross 2009, 291). It was intended as a\nresponse to a treatise by Giuseppe Passi, I donneschi\ndiffetti (The Defects of Women). The commission attests\nboth to the reputation Marinella enjoyed as an intellectual, and to\nthe support she received from a wider circle. \nIn the sixteenth century the Italian vernacular increasingly replaced\nLatin as the language appropriate to a broad range of topics and\ngenres (Panizza and Wood 2000, 65, 195), so Marinella was not\neccentric in her choice of the vernacular (her father also wrote in\nItalian, and had publicly urged others to do so). The choice did,\nnonetheless, mean that her treatise in defense of women was available\nto more people, especially women. In her own time she was renowned as\nlearned and eloquent, and she acquired a reputation as a rigorous\nscholar and a skillful philosopher; this was certainly in part due to\nthe merits of her published work, but the respect she\nenjoyed—very unusual for a feminist—may have had something\nto do with the seclusion of her life and a reputation for sexual\nmodesty. \nAlthough many of Marinella’s works, especially the long poem\nL’Enrico, overo Bisantio acquistato (1635), include\nphilosophical themes, The Nobility stands as her most\nimportant, and perhaps her only uncontestable, contribution to\nphilosophy. It is a contribution to a debate about the nature and the\nmerits of women, which had its origin in The Book of the City of\nLadies (1405) by Christine de Pizan (an argument for the moral\nsuperiority of her sex) written in response to The Romance of the\nRose (~1275) by Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun, in which\nwomen were vilified. Polemical works arguing that men were superior to\nwomen, or that women were superior to men, had proliferated in\nsubsequent centuries, in French, Italian, Latin, German, Spanish and\nEnglish. Such treatises generally relied on some combination of\nargument (usually drawn from ancient sources), examples, and citations\nfrom scripture and from literary or philosophical authorities. \nThe Nobility appeared when the debate had been running for\ntwo hundred years. Marinella was responding directly to the treatise\nby Giuseppe Passi, I donneschi diffetti (The Defects of\nWomen), published in 1599 in Venice and Milan, and so the\nstructure and methodology of The Nobility mirror those of\nThe Defects of Women (Kolsky 2001, 974). Passi had cited a\nvariety of ancient and medieval authorities, many of whom cite\nAristotle as the source of their arguments, which may explain\nMarinella’s particular concern both to use and to discredit\nAristotle; at any rate, she takes Passi to be a contemporary\nrepresentative of a misogynist tradition beginning with Aristotle and\nextending forward through Boccaccio. The Defects of Women\nstands as an extreme example of the genre of attacks on women, with\nPassi claiming that women are covered from head to toe in vices and\ndefects (Passi 1599, 240). The argument of the treatise begins with\nthe claim that the female is imperfect, created only as a\n‘necessary evil’. The imperfection of women is\nfundamentally that they are especially subject to passion (8). The\nheat of women’s bodies is both the source and the sign of her\nsubjection to passion (29). Because women are in thrall to their\npassions, they may not, strictly speaking, be rational animals (216).\nThis possibility is suggested and legitimized by Aristotle’s\nassertion that the deliberative faculty of women has no authority\n(215). Passi satirizes intellectual women (278–9), and comes\nclose to suggesting that women are a different species from men,\ninsisting that women should be treated like animals because both women\nand animals lack reason and virtue (Malpezzi Price and Ristaino 2008,\n108). The Defects of Women treatise is remarkable for its\nvirulence, but in no way original in substance.  \nThere were precedents for many of Marinella’s claims and\narguments in The Nobility, perhaps as early as Christine de\nPizan (although there is no evidence that Marinella had read\nPizan—see Ross 2009, 326 (n.6)), but certainly in the work of\nHenricus Agrippus, De nobilitate et praecellentia foeminei\nsexus (On the Nobility and Excellence of the Feminine\nSex), published in Latin in 1529 and translated soon after into\nItalian (in 1549 by Alessandro Piccolomini), and the treatise Il\nCortegione (The Courtier) (1528) by Baldassare\nCastiglione. Agrippa drew an analogy between the subjection of women\nand political tyranny, and this may have paved the way for\nMarinella’s political approach to the issue of women’s\nnature. Castiglione, using the form of the dialogue, offers a\nrefutation of certain Aristotelian claims about the imperfection of\nwomen (through the voice of Giuliano de’ Medici), and an\nexposition of Neoplatonic love theory as popularized by Marsilio\nFicino (through the voice of Pietro Bembo). Marinella also draws on\nthe work of Leone Ebreo, the Dialoghi d’amore (1535),\nin which love is a cosmic force infusing all of creation, and the love\nbetween men and women, and not only between men, is recognized as a\nroute to divinity. Another important source for Marinella’s\ntreatise is the dialogue by Lodovico Domenichi entitled La\nnobiltà delle donne (The Nobility of Women),\npublished in Venice in 1549. This work features characters who voice\nopinions from both sides of the debate about women; it includes\narguments for the superior physiology of women that Marinella revises\nand elaborates in her treatise. While she drew on these works\nextensively, her argument marks a philosophical advance because it is\ndetailed, systematic, and cogent. Although The Nobility was\npublished in the same year that Moderata Fonte’s dialogue\n(Il merito delle donne) defending women, was published,\nIl merito had been written some years before. Marinella makes\nseveral references to Fonte, but none to Il merito. It is\nimpossible to know how well acquainted she was with Fonte’s\nwork, or what she thought of it. (For a discussion of\nMarinella’s knowledge of Fonte’s work see Kolsky 2001,\n981–2). \nIn The Nobility Marinella argues that there is a feminine\nnature that is different from, and superior to, masculine nature. It\nwas a commonplace that a person was called to a certain office in life\nby God; the nobility of a person was a function of that office and how\nwell one carried out its duties. “Questions of virtue thus\ninevitably allude to a social hierarchy that was generally accepted as\na reflection of the hierarchy of creation, an order in nature or\nof nature, instituted not fortuitously but providentially,\nand therefore not subject to alteration by human beings,”\n(Jordan 1990, 21). In this intellectual context, arguing that women\nwere superior in nature to men was a way of arguing that the office in\nlife that women were intended by God to fulfill was itself better. \nMarinella’s central claim in The Nobility is,\n“…that the female sex is nobler and more excellent than\nthe male,” (1601b, 39). More precisely, she says that she will\nshow “…that they [women] surpass men in the nobility of\ntheir names, causes, nature, operations and the things men say about\nthem,” (41). That names might indicate something about the\nthings to which they refer was a commonplace of the Renaissance, with\norigins in the interpretation of Plato’s Cratylus. The\ncauses of a phenomenon were similarly taken to indicate something\nimportant of the phenomenon itself—better causes producing\nbetter effects. The “nature” of woman Marinella shows to\nbe, on the one hand, a nature shared with men and, on the other, a\ndistinct nature; as the formal cause of a substance, the nature\ndetermines the worth of that substance. The “operations”\nof women are the things they are able to do insofar as they are\nensouled beings rather than inanimate objects. Since Marinella argues\nthat women have better souls than men, she takes as evidence for this\nthe superior merit of the activities that they perform with the soul.\nFinally, Marinella’s objective to demonstrate that men\nthemselves make evident the superiority of women (by means of\n“the things they say about women”) represents her most\nimportant strategy: to take the evidence usually adduced by men to\ndemonstrate the inferiority of women, and reveal through\ninterpretation that in fact it demonstrates the superiority of\nwomen. \nThe Nobility is divided into two parts, the first of which\ndemonstrates the nobility and excellence of women, the second of which\nsets out the defects and failings of men. Both the respects in which\nshe claims superiority for women and the contrast she draws between\nthe excellences of women and the vices of men are standard in the\ncontributions to the querelle des femmes that take the side\nof women. What is unusual with Marinella is the learning, the\nsophistication, and the systematic and cogent development of the\narguments. Unlike most pro-woman authors, she makes no concessions to\nthe convention of masculine excellence, asserting the superiority of\nwomen in all respects. The argument for women’s superiority is\nlargely set out in the first part of the treatise. But the second\npart, on the defects of men, is not incidental to the central claim\nthat women are nobler. Marinella details the defects of men, and in\nparticular their evil motives, in order to support her positive\nargument for women’s nobility, by demonstrating that the motives\nmen have for denigrating women are ignoble, stem from defects of\nnature, and are thus evidence of the inferiority of men. So the\ndefects of men are introduced not only so that women might appear more\nexcellent in comparison, but also, and more importantly, to show that\nthe deficiencies attributed to women by men are more properly the\ndeficiencies of male nature, and that those very deficiencies are\nresponsible for the fallacious claims about women made by some men\n(Aristotle and Passi in particular). So Marinella offers an\nexplanation for the misogynist claims to which she is responding, and\nthat explanation supports her claim that women are better than men in\ncertain precise respects. \nMarinella draws on both Platonist and Aristotelian accounts of\ncausation, interpreted through ancient, medieval, and Renaissance\ncommentators (she cites Plotinus, Lombard, Ebreo, and Ficino), when\nshe argues that women are superior to men with respect to the causes\nthat have generated them. Aristotle had posited four kinds of cause:\nmaterial, formal, efficient, and final. In the case of an unqualified\nchange, such as the generation of a substance (e.g., a person or a\nsquirrel), the causes can be understood as follows: the material cause\nis the stuff out of which the substance is made, which remains as a\nconstituent of the substance; the formal cause is the principle of\norganization that bestows on the individual substance both its form\nand its function, making it a member of a natural kind, with the\ncharacteristic properties and behaviors of that kind; the efficient\ncause initiates the process of generation; the final cause is the aim\nor end point of the process, which will often be in effect the same as\nthe formal cause, because the aim of a process of generation is the\nmature and perfected form and function of the substance. Consider the\nexample of the generation of an individual belonging to a natural\nkind, the squirrel (a natural substance). The material cause of the\nsquirrel is the flesh, bone, blood, etc. from which the squirrel is\nconstituted; the formal cause of the squirrel is its shape and\nfunction; the efficient cause of the squirrel is the male parent of\nthat squirrel (because, on Aristotle’s view it is the male\nparent that initiates the process of generation of offspring); and the\nfinal cause is to be a mature squirrel and carry out the functions of\na squirrel (whatever those may prove to be). \nMarinella, following this tradition, distinguishes the\n“efficient or productive cause” from the material cause in\nthe production of every creature, among which she includes woman, and\nman. On her view, all created things (for example, all angels,\nheavenly bodies, people, elements—earth, water, fire and\nair—and animals) ultimately have the same productive or\nefficient cause, namely God. With respect to the efficient cause,\nthen, created things differ not at all. But there are distinctions in\nworth among created kinds (and also among individuals, insofar as the\ncauses of two individuals of the same kind might differ), and these\ndistinctions are a function of the differences in the ideas of God,\nwhom Marinella compares to an architect or painter, who effects the\nproduction of buildings or art-works through the formulation of an\nidea or plan. The ideas are the formal causes, which, as we have seen,\nare the principles of organization that bestow on the individual\nsubstance both its form and its function; these produce the different\nkinds of creatures, and the differences among individuals within a\nkind. On this account, then, God’s creative process resembles\nthe production of artifacts: in the same way that the painter will\nhave better and worse ideas (in the sense that the ideas for the\npaintings will be ideas of better and worse things), so too God will\nhave ideas of better and worse things that he brings into being: what\nGod creates is not of uniform value. (The conception of\n‘ideas’ here, while clearly Platonic in origin, parallels\nAristotelian formal causes.) \nIn describing the important differences among ideas in the mind of\nGod, and hence among formal causes, Marinella adverts in particular to\nthe different purposes that different kinds are to serve: \nThat same courteous hand created angels, heavens, men, and the rude,\ndull earth, all in varying degrees of perfection….It is the\ncreator who decides which things are of less value and which are\nworthier, and more particularly, which have a less noble purpose and\nwhich a more remarkable one. (Marinella 1601b, 52 (references to\nMarinella are all to 1601b)) \nThat is, while God as the productive cause of every created thing is\none and the same, the formal causes—the ideas in the mind of\nGod—will be different, and of different value. Moreover, the\nends to which the productive cause, God, intended to put each creature\nare different, and so the final causes responsible for the creation of\ndifferent creatures will also be different. Marinella does not\nimmediately conclude that women are superior to men; rather she\nconcludes that it is possible: \nDifferent degrees of perfection can be found, therefore…in\neverything in the world…If this is the case…why should\nnot woman be nobler than man and have a rarer and more excellent\npurpose than he, as indeed can be manifestly understood from her\nnature? (1601b, 53)  \nIn other words, if (i) the ideas of created kinds in God’s mind\ndiffer with respect to the intrinsic worth of the kind and with\nrespect to the purpose of the kind, and if (ii) God’s idea of\nwoman was different from God’s idea of man and so women have a\ndifferent divinely determined purpose from that of men—then\n(iii) it is possible that women are nobler than men. \nWomen and men might then be different with respect to the idea and\npurpose (the formal and final causes) in the mind of God, but they are\nnot different with respect to the efficient cause that brings them\ninto being—God himself. Marinella’s discussion of the\nfourth kind of cause, the material cause, forms an important part of\nher argument, in which she makes a number of distinct points about the\nbody as material cause of the ensouled being. She believes women are\nbetter than men with respect to the material cause, first citing an\nargument made by Christine de Pizan and restated by Agrippa: because\nwoman was created from the rib of man, and man was already an ensouled\nbeing, and hence a living being, the material cause of woman is better\nthan that of man, who was made from earth, which is lifeless\n matter.[2]\n This argument depends on the implicit premise that ensouled beings\nare superior to inanimate beings, but that was a view of the hierarchy\nof being current since antiquity, and so one that Marinella believes\nherself entitled to use. This is only the first demonstration of the\nsuperiority of women’s bodies to men; Marinella has quite a lot\nto add on the subject of the material or bodily superiority of women\n(discussed in\n Section 5 below),\n insofar as that superiority is a sign or mark of a better soul. \nTo demonstrate that women are superior in nature to men, Marinella has\nto establish that it is possible for members of the same species to\nhave souls that are the same in kind and yet different in merit. She\nacknowledges the widely accepted view that a species form is the same\nin every individual:  \n…if we speak as philosophers, we will say that man’s soul\nis equally noble to woman’s because both are of the same species\nand therefore of the same nature and substance, (1601b, 55); \nand  \n…if we wished to apply the common reasoning, we would say that\nwomen’s souls are equal to men’s. (1601b, 57) \nShe is adverting here to Moderata Fonte and again to Agrippa, who had\nbegun his Proclamation by claiming that God  \nhas attributed to both man and woman an identical soul, which sexual\ndifference does not at all affect…Thus, there is no preeminence\nof nobility of one sex over the other by reason of the nature of the\nsoul; rather, inwardly free, each is equal in dignity, (Agrippa 1529,\n43); \nshe likely also has in mind Castiglione, who wrote \nthe male will not be more perfect than the female as regards their\nformal substance, because the one and the other are included under the\nspecies man, and that in which the one differs from the other is an\naccident and is not of the essence. (Castiglione 1528, 214)  \nShe agrees that women have the same rational souls as men, and belong\nto the same species, but denies that it follows from this that their\nsouls are no nobler than the souls of men. That is, she argues, on the\nbasis of the theory of causation that she set out, that \nit is not impossible that within the same species there should be\nsouls that are from birth nobler and more excellent than\nothers…I say that women’s souls were created nobler than\nmen’s. (1601b, 55)  \nMarinella quite explicitly rejects, then, the idea that men and women\nmust be equal in nobility because they belong to the same species; but\nshe also anticipates the objection that because the species essence,\nthe rational faculty of soul, is the same in every individual person,\nwe might expect that men and women would be equal in worth. It\nfollows, and again she recognizes this, that she must assert that the\nform of a species is not without diversity, and so she explicitly\nargues for variations in the idea or form or soul of the human\nspecies. “Women’s souls can, therefore, be nobler and more\nprized in their creation than men’s,” (1601b, 57). In\nlight of what she has said about ideas in the mind of God as\nproductive causes of created beings, this must mean: the idea of woman\n(or perhaps the ideas of individual women) in the mind of God is an\nidea of something with a nobler and better purpose, with the result\nthat the creature produced is nobler and more excellent. This is\nconsistent with the claim that men and women have the same rational\nsouls, if we allow that the human soul is constituted by something\nmore than the faculty of reason, and so two human (and hence rational)\nsouls might be put to different purposes. Marinella seeks to show that\nthe purposes to which a rational soul is put will depend, at least in\npart, on the desires of the rational agent. \nThe question she confronts is, then, if men and women have souls that\nmake them the same in species—the same in rational\ncapacity—how can women be superior to men? Marinella’s\nanswer depends on distinctions in the faculties of soul, and in\nparticular on a distinction between the rational part and the desiring\npart, in which moral virtues are located. She aims to show that women\nare morally superior to men, and that this causes them to be\n“even better than men at learning the same arts and\nsciences,” (1601b, 83). That is, her argument is that the moral\nsuperiority of women has an impact on their rational faculties, which\ncauses them to be intellectually superior (better at the same arts and\nsciences) although they are created with the same rational faculty.\nThe argument depends ultimately on Marinella’s views about the\ncausal role of bodily temperature on the soul’s functions, and\nabout the moral status of the actions that issue from the soul’s\nfunctioning, views that will be elaborated in the following section.\nBut Marinella produces a variety of kinds of evidence that, with\nrespect to the moral virtues, and especially with respect to the\ncontrol of the passions, women are superior. First, she claims that\nwomen are superior to men with respect to a variety of individual\nmoral and intellectual virtues, and provides evidence in the form of\nexamples of excellent women who manifest these virtues (“It is a\nfact known to everyone that women are continent and temperate, for we\nnever see or read about them getting drunk or spending all day in\ntaverns, as dissolute men do, nor do they give themselves\nunrestrainedly to other pleasures,” (1601b, 94).) Second, she\npoints out that since men, whatever they might say about\nwomen, treat women with signs of honor, and since “nobody honors\nanother person unless they know that the person has some gift or\nquality that is superior to his own” (1601b, 69), we should\nconclude that men themselves recognize the superiority of women. But,\nas we will see in the next section, she ultimately traces the moral\nsuperiority of women, which is responsible for their intellectual\nsuperiority, to differences in men’s and women’s\nbodies. \nMarinella clearly suggests, then, that both deliberative and\nspeculative reason are exercised more effectively by women because of\nthe moral advantages of their sex. Granting that women and men have\nthe same rational faculties of soul, if women are morally superior to\nmen, they will also thereby attain intellectual superiority, making\nthem better at learning the same arts and sciences. Although the souls\nof women are “still nobler” than those of men with respect\nin particular to the moral faculty, that nobility will have an impact\non the rational faculty with the result that women are better than men\nintellectually and not only morally. \nSo while Marinella asserts (on the authority of Aristotle and\nscripture) that we can know the souls of men and women to be forms of\nthe same species, rational souls, and equal in that respect, she also\ninsists that this fundamental sameness allows nonetheless for\ndistinctions in merit. Women’s souls are superior to those of\nmen, because the moral character of women makes their faculty of\ndesire, and ultimately also their faculty of reason, better than\nmen’s. The superiority of women’s desires she traces to\ntheir temperate physiology, and she takes the proof of the superiority\nof their souls to be manifested in the beauty of their bodies. \nAlthough the souls of men and women are identical with respect to the\nrational faculty, Marinella claims that women have better souls than\nmen because (i) they have better desires which in turn (ii) affect the\ncapacity for reason, effectively rendering women better able to access\nand act on their reason, so that (iii) women behave better—and\nin particular, they behave with more moderation. She also argues that\nthe female body offers evidence of the superiority of women’s\nsouls, both as a cause and as an effect, despite the equality of\nrational capacity enjoyed by men and women. \nShe adopts the common distinction between body and soul:  \nWomen, like men, consist of two parts. One, the origin and cause of\nall noble deeds, is referred to by everyone as the soul. The other is\nthe transitory and mortal body. (1601b, 55)  \nThe soul, on her view, commands the body (or ought to); at the same\ntime, it is dependent on the body for its operations (55). That is,\nthe operations of the soul—including desires, thoughts,\ndecisions, and actions—require the body. Because the soul relies\non the body for its operations, the body manifests or expresses the\ncharacter of the soul and its faculties, in a variety of ways. \nWhen feminist philosophers first considered the question of sexual\ndifference in the Renaissance, they were writing in response to\novertly misogynistic claims (in Marinella’s case, the claims of\nPassi), which centred on the physical, moral and intellectual failings\nof women. One question feminists then had to face was whether to\nconcede the facts, and dispute the explanation, or to dispute the\nfacts. The question was whether it was better (i) to concede that\nwomen might appear to be inferior to men in a variety of ways (to be,\nfor example, more foolish or more focused on frivolous pursuits) but\nto dispute that nature made them such or (ii) to dispute that women\nwere more foolish, morally weak, or physically incapable in fact.\nMarinella by and large adopts the second strategy, arguing that women\nin fact display in their behavior not ignorance, unreason, vanity or\nflightiness, but on the contrary all the moral excellences that their\ndetractors accuse them of lacking. At the same time, she does believe\nthat men have suppressed the abilities and limited the opportunities\nof women, particularly with respect to intellectual endeavours, and\nthat is a reason to expect that women might not be able to speak for\nthemselves—their souls cannot express themselves directly\n(Marinella 1601b, 80; Malpezzi Price and Ristaino 2008, 116). The\nsuppression of women’s abilities, and the concrete suppression\nof their speech, justifies in Marinella’s view moving to\nconsider the evidence of women’s bodies in order to understand\ntheir souls, and to argue for the superiority of women on that basis.\nBecause the soul of a person operates through the body, the body\nmanifests certain characteristics of the soul, and so stands to offer\nevidence of the character of the soul. \nMarinella intends then to demonstrate the superiority of women’s\nsouls through the superiority of their bodies. She appeals to two\nphysical indications of the greater nobility of women’s souls:\n(i) the moderate temperature of the female body, and (ii) their bodily\nbeauty. Consider her claim that “the greater nobility and\nworthiness of a woman’s body is shown by its delicacy, its\ncomplexion, and its temperate nature, as well as by its beauty,”\n(1601b, 57). She believes the delicacy and complexion peculiar to\nwomen’s bodies are caused by the more moderate temperature of\nthe body, so—despite this list—there are only two\nfundamental differences in the bodies of men and women, temperature\nand beauty.  \nTemperature, on Marinella’s view, is the physical cause (the\nmaterial cause) of the superiority of women’s souls:  \nit is necessary that I should clarify to some extent the nature of the\nbody, because nearly all of its virtues and defects depend on its\ntemperature, so that reason, even though it is master, is frequently\ndazzled and blinded by the senses. (1601b, 77) \nThe right, moderate, temperature, will ensure that reason is not\nblinded by the senses, and hence will allow reason to retain control\nover desire; and moderate temperature is, on Marinella’s\naccount, most often found in women. The philosophical foundation for\nthe claim that the temperature of women’s bodies is a sign of\ntheir virtue is an interpretation of Aristotle’s natural\nphilosophy. (It is possible that she also had Galen in mind.)\nMarinella claims that the lower temperature of women’s bodies\ncauses them to have superior moral virtues, and in this she is\noriginal; Castiglione had argued that women were more temperate\nphysiologically, but he did not draw the connection to moral\ntemperance so explicitly (see Castiglione 1528, 219). Marinella\nreports that Aristotle says that women are “Less hot than men\nand therefore more imperfect and less noble,” (130). She agrees\nwith Aristotle that relative to men women are cooler in temperature,\nbut she disagrees that women are cold in absolute terms. She then\ndevelops an argument that demonstrates, in part by pointing out\ndiscrepancies in Aristotle’s own account of the effects of heat\nand cold on certain soul functions, that the relative coolness of the\nfemale is a moral, and ultimately an intellectual, advantage. \nAristotle believed that the fundamental difference between male and\nfemale animals was a different capacity to concoct excess blood in the\nbody into semen through a process that involved the transmission of\nheat to the blood; ultimately this difference was caused by a\ndifference in heat, or the capacity to transmit heat, in the hearts of\nmales and females (Marinella cites History of Animals IX, but\nthere is considerable evidence for this view in the Generation of\nAnimals as well; see, for example GA IV. 1 766a31–6). That\nis, the distinction between male and female animals resides in their\nheart, which is the source of natural heat, such that women are less\ncapable of producing vital heat. \nAristotle consistently says that animals that are more intelligent\nhave the “purest” blood; and more generally, he asserts\nthat the quality of blood affects the intelligence and temperament of\nanimals (see, e.g., Generation of Animals 2.6\n744a28–32, Parts of Animals 2.4 650b19–25,\n651a12–16). Moreover, Aristotle suggests that these differences\nin blood occur not only across animal species, but also between the\nsexes in a species. His claim is that hot, thin, pure blood is best,\nbecause such blood correlates both with courage (manliness) and with\npractical wisdom (Parts of Animals II. 2 748a2–14). The\nimplication is clearly that those animals that benefit from hot, thin,\npure blood are superior both with respect to deliberative reasoning\nand with respect to the moral virtue of courage. So men, in virtue of\ntheir body temperature, have an advantage, both intellectual and\nmoral, over women. \nBut Aristotle’s views on the effects of temperature on the\nblood, and through the blood on the soul’s faculties, present\ncertain challenges of interpretation: in the same passage of the\nParts of Animals just cited, Aristotle says first that cold,\nthin blood is best for intelligence, and then that hot, thin blood is\nbest. Marinella exploits this ambiguity, elaborating on\nCastiglione’s point that women are, in themselves, temperate\nrather than cold (see Castiglione 1528, 219). She agrees that women\nare colder, and embraces the notion that cold blood is intelligent\nblood. But she goes further than Castiglione in asserting that hot\nblood is associated with intemperate passions, and deduces the\nsuperiority of women with respect to intelligence, temperance, and\ngeneral virtue or nobility. She says, \nI now believe that Aristotle did not consider the workings of heat\nwith a mature mind, nor what it signifies to be more or less hot, nor\nwhat good and bad effects derive from this. (1601b, 130)  \nShe links here maturity with femininity, and femininity with relative\ncoldness of temperature, thus extending the claim that cold blood\nsupports greater intelligence to the claim that cold blood supports\nsuperior moral strength, by claiming that cooler blood encourages\ntemperance with respect to pleasure and desire. Passi, and other\nopponents of women, accused women of intemperance, lasciviousness, and\ninconstancy; Marinella argues in response that the cooler temperature\nwomen enjoy allows them to keep their desires in check so that they\ncan reason more effectively than men, who are over-heated relative to\nwomen. \nThe degree of heat in a living body affects directly the specific\ncharacter of the operations of the soul, making, for example,\nreasoning or desiring more or less principled, or more or less\nimpulsive. Marinella asserts (citing Plutarch as her authority) that\n“heat is an instrument of the soul,” (1601b, 130). That\nis, the soul will operate in some instances through the mechanism of\nheat; the soul must use the body’s heat as an instrument to\nconduct its operations—where those operations are not only\nrational activities, but are also the operations of desire and\nappetite. Now, since these operations of the soul affect in turn the\nactions that a person takes, the effects of body temperature extend\nbeyond the direct effects on the activities of the soul, to the\nchoices and actions the person takes, causing them to be virtuous or\nvicious. This is borne out by what Marinella says about the relation\nbetween temperate body heat and both moral and intellectual virtues.\n“Little and failing heat, as in old people, is powerless for the\nsoul’s operations,” whereas excessive heat “makes\nsouls precipitous and unbridled,” (1601b, 130). So insufficient\nheat makes the soul’s operations (cognitive and moral)\nineffectual, but excessive heat makes the soul’s operations\nunprincipled and impulsive. Now, the effects of insufficient or\nexcessive heat are deeds, good or bad. Insufficient heat will lead to\ninaction, and excessive heat will lead to vicious action. \nIn response, then, to Passi and Aristotle, Marinella concedes the\nempirical point, that women are colder but (i) disputes that women are\ncolder absolutely (because, as Castiglione pointed out, temperature is\nrelative, and hence women might be colder than men and yet temperate\n‘in themselves’), and (ii) disputes the relation between\nheat and nobility, first citing various examples of those who are\nhotter than, but not nobler than, some others. She points out that\nregional climactic differences historically considered to affect body\ntemperature exceed and confound sex differences—so African and\nSpanish women will be hotter than German men. If, as Marinella’s\nopponents believe, greater heat necessarily leads to greater virtue,\nthen they should concede that African women will be more virtuous than\nGerman men. But those who argue that women are less noble than men\nbecause they have less heat than men, will not allow that men living\nin colder climates are less noble than women living in warmer\nclimates. So they should abandon the general principle that heat\ncorrelates with greater nobility. Moreover, Marinella claims that some\nindividuals will have had ‘natures’ hotter than Plato and\nAristotle (it is not clear what the evidence for this is, but it is\nclear that she supposes there is some independent measure of heat\nother than virtue). And she assumes we can all agree that no one has\never been more virtuous than Plato and Aristotle. So, once again, her\nopponents must concede that it is not a universal truth that greater\nheat leads to greater virtue. We might expect Marinella, having\ndisputed the relation between heat and nobility, to abandon any\nattempt to argue that women are superior to men in virtue of their\nbody temperature. But she does not acknowledge an inconsistency in\narguing both that there is no correlation between greater heat and\ngreater virtue and that women are superior because they are colder. If\none were to object to her argument that men who live in colder\nclimates ought to be cooler than women who live in warmer climates,\nand therefore better than those women, she would reply that those men\nhad effectively become women: \n…if a man performs excellent deeds it is because his nature is\nsimilar to a woman’s, possessing temperate but not excessive\nheat, and because his years of virile maturity have tempered the\nfervor of that heat he possessed in his youth and made his nature more\nfeminine so that it operates with greater wisdom and maturity. (1601b,\n131) \nThis suggests also that in those places where women become hotter\nbecause of the climate, they will become worse—but not relative\nto men who live in the same climate. If there is a correlation between\nlower body temperature and virtue, and one allows that in warmer\nclimates everyone will have a higher body temperature, but that women\nwill generally have a lower body temperature than men in the same\nclimate, then women will be more virtuous than men in any given\nregion. \nMarinella argues, then, that Aristotle was correct to conclude that\nwomen are usually, if not always, cooler than men, but she insists\nthat women are temperate rather than cold. She then links, causally,\nthe physical state of a cooler body temperature with a capacity to\nexecute the soul’s operations with sufficient force, but without\nexcessive passion: those who are physically temperate are also\npsychologically and morally temperate. When men succeed in virtuous\ndeeds, it will be because they have become more feminine—more\nmoderate in temperature—often with maturity, which Marinella\nassumes brings with it moderation in temperature. If women are\n(generally) the right temperature for virtue, and men are (generally)\nhotter than women, then clearly men are too hot. Moreover, there is\nindependent evidence for men’s excessive heat in their actions,\nin particular in the intemperance they exhibit and the passionate love\nthey indulge in. The greater nobility of women’s moral character\nallows them to perform more noble intellectual acts, because of the\nrelation between desire and intellect. A person has a better character\nwhen the faculty of desire submits willingly to the faculty of reason.\nAnd when that is the case, reason is freer to exercise its own\nfunctions, without interference from desire. So the nobler moral\ncharacter of women permits their intellects to focus on rational\nactivities, without the distraction of having to control unbridled or\nmistaken desires. This accounts for the greater intellectual ability,\nas well as the superior moral character, that Marinella attributes to\nwomen. \nThe passionate love men experience for women is excited by the beauty\nof women, and that beauty is the second of the fundamental differences\nMarinella cites between the bodies of women and those of men, as\nevidence of the superiority of women’s souls and ultimately of\nwomen themselves. While temperature is a cause of superiority, beauty\nis a manifestation of the superior character of the souls of women,\nand evidence of the nobility of the idea in the mind of God that is\nthe form of woman: “…the Idea of women is nobler than\nthat of men. This can be seen by their beauty and goodness, which is\nknown to everybody” (1601b, 53). Marinella understands the body\nto manifest the character of the soul, so she believes that we can\nknow that women’s souls are nobler than men’s through\n“the effect they [the souls] have and from the beauty of their\nbodies,” (55). The beauty is an effect of “a grace or\nsplendor proceeding from the soul as well as from the body,”\n(57). And Marinella states quite explicitly, “The soul…is\nthe cause and origin of physical beauty,” (58). Taken together,\nthese assertions suggest that the soul bestows grace or beauty on the\nbody, and that those qualities then ‘proceed’ from the\nbody as well as from the soul. If we accept that the soul is the cause\nof physical beauty, and we assume that effects resemble causes, then\nwe can learn something about the character of the soul from the\ncharacter of the body. To understand how Marinella conceives of\nbeauty, and her philosophical purposes in appealing to beauty as\nevidence of moral and intellectual superiority, we need to consider\nher sources, and also the relation between beauty, heat, and the\nvirtues of women as she contrasts them with the vices of men. We\nshould also notice that she claims on the one hand that all women are\nbeautiful, and that no man is: “I say that compared to women all\nmen are ugly,” (63); and on the other hand, that she allows that\nthere are variations in beauty between individual women, and that men\ncan be more or less beautiful (167). \nThe philosophical sources for the view that women’s beauty is a\nsign of a virtuous soul are interpretations of Plato’s dialogue,\nthe Symposium. Ficino’s translation of the\nSymposium was especially influential at the time Marinella\nwas writing, and she does refer to it, but she seems to have based\nmuch of her discussion on Leone Ebreo’s Dialoghi\nd’amore. Two aspects of Platonic theory are pertinent here.\nThe first is the view that particular beings in this world have the\nfeatures they do by means of participation in ideal Forms. So women\nare beautiful because they participate in the Form of the Beautiful\nItself; and their beauty is itself a mark or sign of their\nparticipation. “Divine beauty is…the first and principal\ncause of women’s beauty,” (1601b, 60). The Platonist\nunderstanding of causation allows that while divine being is the first\nand principal cause, there are creaturely causes which mediate the\neffects of that first cause, so that the soul of a woman can be the\nimmediate cause and origin of her physical beauty while divine beauty\nis its first cause. Marinella cites Ebreo for the claim that corporeal\nbeauty is an image of divine beauty, and then argues:  \nIf it [corporeal beauty] came solely from the body, each body would be\nbeautiful, which it is not. Beauty and majesty of body are, therefore,\nborn of superior reason. (1601b, 59) \nThe second aspect of Platonic theory that serves Marinella’s\nargument from beauty to the superiority of women is the view that\nerotic desire, understood as a response to (and a desire for) beauty,\nis an impulse which leads us ultimately to the Form of Good Itself, by\nmeans of particular good things, which are identified with beautiful\nthings. Agrippa had made a similar argument, which may have influenced\nMarinella. He wrote \nSince beauty itself is nothing other than the refulgence of the divine\ncountenance and light which is found in things and shines through a\nbeautiful body, women—who reflect the divine—were much\nmore lavishly endowed and furnished with beauty than man (Agrippa\n1529, 50),  \nand adds that “all are dazzled by her beauty and love and\nvenerate her on many accounts” (51). Marinella reports that\n‘Platonists’ say: “External beauty is the image of\ndivine beauty,” (1601b, 58). She agrees with the poets who say\nthat beauty is a path that guides us directly to the contemplation of\ndivine wisdom; and in her own voice asserts that beauty is a golden\nchain, that “always raises us toward God, from whom it is\nderived,” (64–5). So the fact that men experience desire\nfor women, because they perceive them as beautiful, is a sign that men\nrecognize that women are good, and indeed better than men. This is\nbecause we desire to possess the good forever, and we do not desire\nwhat we already have. If, then, men desire women it must be that women\nare better than men, and closer to the divine. \nMarinella’s own account of beauty is simply this: it is “a\nray of light from the soul that pervades the body in which it finds\nitself,” citing Plotinus as the source. She also cites\nFicino’s letters, and a variety of poets, in support of the view\nthat beauty is a kind of light—or like a ray of light—from\nthe soul, which is compared to the sun. On this account, then, beauty\ndoes not lie in the symmetry of features, or youth, or indeed in any\nmaterial feature of women’s bodies. It is rather an ineffable\naura that pervades womankind. Marinella has support for this view from\nPlatonist philosophers, and indeed from those who oppose her and yet\nallow that “women’s lovely faces shine with the grace and\nsplendor of paradise” and she uses it to undermine the claim for\nsuperiority of men. If men were in fact superior to women, then it\nwould be women who desired men, not men who desired women, whereas in\nfact,  \nthey [men] are forced to love them [women] for this beauty, while\nwomen are not forced to love men, because that which is less\nbeautiful, or ugly, is not by nature worthy of being loved…They\n[men] would not be loved by women were it not for our courteous and\nbenign natures, to which it seems discourteous not to love our male\nadmirers a little. (1601b, 63)  \nMarinella thus appears to assert that women do not desire men, but\nexperience only a polite reciprocal affection for those men who love\nthem. This is likely to have been a strategic claim, aimed as a retort\nagainst Passi and other men writing against women, who often accused\nwomen of lasciviousness and promiscuity. Marinella is claiming that\nsexual desire is so foreign to women (at least to most women) that\nthey are incapable of lascivious sentiments or acts. \nIf women are beautiful and temperate in their bodies, it is because\ntheir souls are better organized than the souls of men; in particular,\nit is because their desires are obedient to reason. And men are\nsusceptible to woman’s beauty because of the intemperate heat of\nthe male body, which is both produced by the deficiency of the male\nsoul, and a manifestation of that deficiency: \nI wish to go further and show that men are obliged and forced to love\nwomen, and that women are not obliged to love them back, except merely\nfrom courtesy. I also wish to demonstrate that the beauty of women is\nthe way by which those men who are moderate creatures are able to\nraise themselves to the knowledge and contemplation of the divine\nessence. (1601b, 62)  \nSo Marinella turns the arguments of men—both the argument that\nwomen are defective and colder, and the argument that women are\ndefective and weak of will—to her own purposes, demonstrating\nthat women are better for being cooler, and are less weak of will than\nare men, who succumb to the passionate desire for beauty much more\nreadily than do women. \nMarinella demonstrated extraordinary scholarship by the standards of\nher day, particularly with respect to the variety of sources she was\nable to cite, and with greater accuracy than many of her\ncontemporaries. Many defenders of women had contented themselves with\nresponding to vaguely defined opponents; Marinella, by contrast, cited\nher authors and their texts with some precision. This indicates both\nthat she had access to the texts themselves, and not only to reports\non the texts, and also that she understood the scholarly force of\naccurately and precisely representing the claims of an author. This is\none aspect of her methodology that serves as a strength, and singles\nher out from the crowd of pro-woman writers (see Ross 2009, 289). Her\nextensive use of citation served not only to exhibit those claims with\nwhich she was to take issue, but also to allow her to interpret for\nher own purposes the claims of authors with whom she disagreed. She\noften cites the same author both as an authority in support of her\narguments, and as a target against whom she argues—and the\neffect of this is to undermine the authority of that source. \nMarinella was then engaged in establishing the unreliability of the\nvery authorities whose work was supposed to support the inferiority of\nwomen. If Aristotle did not maintain a coherent account of the\nrelation between temperature and rational capacity, we should not\ntrust his assessment of the relative merits of men and women.  \nWhat is unusual about Marinelli’s historicism is that it\nundermines an important and representative authority for\npatriarchy, and consequently links historicism to feminism.\nShe denies the whole category of the authoritative with its implied\nopposition, the category of the specious, and substitutes her own\nconcept of the author—one whose claim to the truth is no more\nthan contingent. (Jordan 1990, 258)  \nMarinella’s methodical use of oppositions in the work of a\nsingle author, the most powerful case being that of Aristotle, leaves\nroom for her to suggest that experience may be a better source of our\nknowledge of women, their capacities and natures. \nIf one effect of Marinella’s marshalling of the evidence for\nboth sides of the woman question is to undermine the authority of\nthose authors most frequently cited by her opponents, another effect\nis to raise the possibility of a skeptical agenda. Like many pro-woman\nauthors, Marinella begins by accepting the claim that the rational\nsouls of men and women are the same, before going on to argue for the\nsuperiority of women. We might wonder why she, and others, were not\ncontent to rest with the claim of equality at the level of the\nrational soul. To put the question another way: Did Marinella truly\nbelieve that women are better than men, or did she argue for that\nposition for other reasons? It is possible that the arguments for\nsuperiority are intended to raise skeptical doubts in the minds of her\naudience, doubts which would make them reluctant to decide the\nquestion of superiority between men and women. If it seemed\npreposterous to argue that women were superior to men, and yet one\ncould do so using unimpeachable authorities, then arguments for the\nsuperiority of men over women, constructed on the foundations of those\nsame authorities, might seem less convincing. So, although many\ncontemporary and later interpreters assume that The Nobility\nis a treatise in support of the superiority of women, there is some\nevidence to suggest that Marinella may have argued for the claim of\nsuperiority not so much to establish its truth as to call into\nskeptical doubt the truth of the claim of superiority for men made by\nher opponents (see O’Neill 2007 for an argument that skepticism\ninformed the work of another sixteenth century feminist, Marie de\nGournay). \nSome evidence that Marinella’s methods are not entirely\ntransparent lies in her late work, Essortationi alle donne\n(Exhortations to women), which on the surface appears to be a\npalinode, a rejection of a lifetime dedicated to study and\nwriting—she specifically urges women not to aspire to a literary\ncareer. Some interpreters have, however, detected in this work\n“a residue of defiance combined with the possibility of\nunmasking male techniques of domination,” (Kolsky 2001, 984).\nSeveral kinds of evidence point to the possibility that Marinella did\nnot intend to subvert the claims of The Nobility: her use of\n“irony, paradox and contradiction,” together with a\nprefatory remark instructing readers to look below the surface of the\ntext, and the reputation of the printer of the Essortationi\nas one who was infamous for publishing “layered\ndiscourses” (Ross 2009, 296–8; Malpezzi Price and Ristaino\n2008, 120–55).","contact.mail":"marguerite.deslauriers@mcgill.ca","contact.domain":"mcgill.ca"}]
