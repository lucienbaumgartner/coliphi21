In his book of 1879,\nBegriffsschrift: eine der arithmetischen nachgebildete\nFormelsprache des reinen Denkens, he developed a second-order\npredicate calculus and used it both to define interesting mathematical\nconcepts and to state and prove mathematically interesting\npropositions. However, in his two-volume work of 1893/1903,\nGrundgesetze der Arithmetik, Frege added (as an axiom) what\nhe thought was a logical proposition (Basic Law V) and tried to derive\nthe fundamental axioms and theorems of number theory from the\nresulting system. Unfortunately, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a\nlogical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be\ninconsistent, for it was subject to Russell’s Paradox.\n\n\nUntil late in the 20th century, the inconsistency in Frege’s\nGrundgesetze overshadowed a deep theoretical accomplishment\nthat can be extracted from his work. The Grundgesetze\ncontains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order\nlogic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single\nconsistent principle. This consistent principle, known in the\nliterature as “Hume’s Principle”, asserts that for\nany concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), the number of \\(F\\)-things is equal to\nthe number \\(G\\)-things if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the \\(F\\)-things and the \\(G\\)-things. Though\nFrege derived Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V in the\nGrundgesetze, the subsequent derivations of the fundamental\npropositions of arithmetic from Hume’s Principle do not\nessentially require Basic Law V. So by setting aside the problematic\nBasic Law V and the derivation of Hume’s Principle, one can\nfocus on Frege’s derivations of the basic propositions of\narithmetic using Hume’s Principle as an axiom. His theoretical\naccomplishment then becomes clear: his work shows us how to prove, as\ntheorems, the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory from\nHume’s Principle in second-order logic. This achievement, which\ninvolves some remarkably subtle chains of definitions and logical\nreasoning, has become known as Frege’s Theorem.\n\n\nThe principal goal of this entry is to present Frege’s Theorem\nin the most logically perspicuous manner, without using\nFrege’s own notation. Of course, Frege’s own notation is\nfascinating and interesting in its own right, and one must come to\ngrips with that notation when studying Frege’s original work.\nBut one need not understand Frege’s notation to understand\nFrege’s Theorem, and so we will, for the most part, put aside\nFrege’s own notation and the many interpretative issues that\narise in connection with it. We strive to present Frege’s\nTheorem by representing the ideas and claims involved in the proof in\nclear and well-established modern logical notation. With a clear\nunderstanding of what Frege accomplished, one will be better prepared\nto understand Frege’s own notation and derivations, as one reads\nFrege’s original work (whether in German or in\ntranslation). Moreover, our efforts below should prepare the reader to\nunderstand a number of scholarly books and articles in the secondary\nliterature on Frege’s work, e.g., Wright 1983, Boolos 1990, and\nHeck 1993, 2011, and 2012.\n\n\nTo accomplish these goals, we presuppose only a familiarity with the\nfirst-order predicate calculus. We show how to extend this language\nand logic to the second-order predicate calculus, and show how to\nrepresent the ideas and claims involved in Frege’s Theorem in\nthis calculus. These ideas and claims all appear in Frege 1893/1903,\nwhich we refer to as Gg I/II. But we\nsometimes also cite his book of 1879 and his book of 1884 (Die\nGrundlagen der Arithmetik), referring to these works as\nBegr and Gl, respectively.\n\nIn this section, we describe the language and logic of the\nsecond-order predicate calculus. We then extend this calculus with the\nclassical comprehension principle for concepts and we introduce and\nexplain \\(\\lambda\\)-notation, which allows one to turn open formulas\ninto complex names of concepts. Although Frege’s own logic is\nrather different from the modern second-order predicate calculus, the\nlatter’s comprehension principle for concepts and\n\\(\\lambda\\)-notation provide us with a logically perspicuous way of\nrepresenting Frege’s Theorem. We shall sometimes remark on the\ndifferences between the calculus presented below and the calculus that\nFrege developed, but such remarks are not intended to be a scholarly\nguide to the many subtleties involved in understanding Frege’s\noriginal works. \nThe language of the second-order predicate calculus starts with the\nfollowing lists of simple terms: \nThe object names and variables denote, or take values in, a domain of\nobjects and the \\(n\\)-place relation names and variables\ndenote, or take values in, a domain of \\(n\\)-place relations.\nObjects and relations are to be regarded as mutually exclusive\ndomains: no object is a relation and no relation is an object. When\ngiving examples of \\(n\\)-place relation names or variables for \\(n\\geq\n2\\), we often write \\(R, S,\\ldots\\) instead of writing\n\\(P^2,Q^2,\\ldots\\).  \nFrom these simple terms, one can define the formulas of the\nlanguage as follows: \nSo, for example, \\(Pa\\), \\(Rxy\\), etc., are atomic formulas and these\nassert, respectively, that object \\(a\\) exemplifies the 1-place\nrelation \\(P\\) and that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) stand in the relation \\(R\\).\nThe formulas \\(\\neg Pa\\) and \\(Pa \\to Rxy\\) are molecular formulas,\nand these assert, respectively, that it is not the case that\n\\(a\\) exemplifies \\(P\\), and that if \\(a\\) exemplifies \\(P\\)\nthen \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) stand in the relation \\(R\\). Finally, here\nare some examples of quantified formulas: \nThe language we defined above is second-order because the last\nclause in the definition of the formulas sanctions both quantified\nformulas of the form \\(\\forall x\\phi\\) and of the form \\(\\forall\nF\\phi\\). In what follows, we employ the standard definitions of the\nfollowing formulas: \nThe first of the above defines the conjunction \\(\\phi\\) and\n\\(\\psi\\); the second defines the disjunction \\(\\phi\\) or\n\\(\\psi\\); the third defines the biconditional \\(\\phi\\) if and only\nif \\(\\psi\\) (which we often abbreviate as iff); and the\nlast defines the existentially quantified formula there is an\n\\(\\alpha\\) such that \\(\\phi\\). It should be noted here that\ninstead of using a linear string of symbols to express molecular and\nquantified formulas, Frege developed a two-dimensional notation for\nsuch formulas. Since we won’t be using Frege’s notation\nfor complex formulas in what follows, we need not spend time\ndescribing it\n here.[1] \nBut even if we put aside Frege’s notation for complex formulas,\nit is important to point out that Frege didn’t use atomic\nformulas of the form \\(Px\\), \\(Rxy\\), etc., as we have done. Instead\nof including \\(n\\)-place relation names and variables among his\nprimitive terms, he included primitive function names and variables such\nas \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), …, and used them to\nsignify functions. That is, instead of distinguishing objects\nand relations, Frege distinguished objects from\nfunctions. Though some developments of the modern predicate\ncalculus include function terms among the simple terms of the\nlanguage, we have not included them because we shall not need them in\nthe development of Frege’s Theorem. \nIt is also important to point out that Frege used functional\napplication ‘\\(f(x)\\)’ to form\ncomplex names in his language and used these names to represent\nnatural language statements. To see how, note that Frege would use the\nexpression ‘\\(f(x)\\)’ to denote the value of the function\n\\(f\\) for the argument \\(x\\). Since he also recognized two special\nobjects he called truth-values (The True and The False), he\ndefined a concept to be any function that always maps its\narguments to truth-values. For example, whereas ‘\\(x^{2}\n+3\\)’ and ‘father-of\n\\(x\\)’ signify ordinary functions, the expressions ‘\\(x\\)\nis happy’ (which we might represent as ‘\\(Hx\\)’) and\n‘\\(x \\gt 5\\)’ signify concepts. The former signifies a\nconcept which maps any object that is happy to The True and all other\nobjects to The False; the latter signifies a concept that maps any\nobject that is greater than 5 to The True and all other objects to The\nFalse. In this way, ordinary language predications like ‘\\(b\\)\nis happy’ and ‘4 is greater than 5’, once\nrepresented in Frege’s language as ‘\\(Hb\\)’ and\n‘\\(4 \\gt 5\\)’, become names of truth-values. \nFor the purposes of understanding Frege’s Theorem, we can think\nof our 1-place relation terms as denoting, or ranging over, Fregean\nconcepts. Once we do this, we can take the formula ‘\\(\nHb\\)’ to mean that \\(b\\) falls under the concept being\nhappy. But for the purposes of understanding Frege’s\nTheorem, it is not necessary to suppose, with Frege, that concepts\nlike being happy are functions from objects to truth values.\nSo, in what follows, one should remember that whereas we can interpret\nthe atomic formula \\(Fx\\) to mean either that \\(x\\) exemplifies\nthe 1-place relation (i.e., property) \\(F\\) or that \\(x\\) falls under\nthe concept \\(F\\), Frege would understand such formulas as instances\nof functional application. Nevertheless, we’ll henceforth call\n1-place relations concepts. For all practical purposes then,\nwe may use the symbols \\(F\\), \\(G\\), … as variables ranging\nover concepts and though we sometimes write ‘\\(F(x)\\)’\ninstead of ‘\\(Fx\\)’ for perspicuity in parsing an\nexpression, we should still think of this as a predication. \nFrege also supposed that when a binary function \\(f\\) (i.e., a\nfunction of two arguments) always maps the arguments \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nto a truth value, \\(f\\) is a relation. So it should be\nremembered that when we use the expression ‘\\(Rxy\\)’\n(or sometimes\n‘\\(R(x,y)\\)’) to assert that the objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nstand in the relation \\(R\\), Frege would say that \\(R\\) maps the pair\nof objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (in that order) to The True. But again,\nthis Fregean interpretation is not required for understanding\nFrege’s Theorem. In what follows, we shall sometimes write the\nsymbol that denotes a mathematical relation in the usual\n‘infix’ notation; for example, ‘\\(\\gt\\)’ denotes\nthe greater-than relation in the expression ‘\\(x \\gt\ny\\)’. \nFinally, it is important to mention that one can add the following\nclause to the definition of the formulas of our second-order\nlanguage so as to include formulas that express identity claims: \nThus, formulas such as ‘\\(x = y\\)’ are part of the\nsecond-order predicate calculus with identity. Frege, too, had\nprimitive identity statements; for him, identity is a binary function\nthat maps a pair of objects to The True whenever those objects are the\nsame object. So whereas we shall suppose that statements like\n‘\\(2^{2} = 4\\)’ are simply true assertions and statements\nlike ‘\\(2^{2} = 3\\)’ are simply false ones, Frege took\n‘\\(2^{2} = 4\\)’ to be a name of The True and took\n‘\\(2^{2} = 3\\)’ to be a name of The False. The statement\nform ‘\\(f(x) = y\\)’ plays an\nimportant role in Frege’s axioms and definitions, but we shall\nnot need to assert claims of this form in order to derive\nFrege’s Theorem. Instead, we shall assume (a) that identity is\nsimply a 2-place relation and (b) that a unary function \\(f\\) is\nreally a relation \\(R\\) that has the following property: \\(Rxy \\amp\nRxz \\to y = z\\) (i.e., that functions are relations that always relate\ntheir first argument to at most one second argument). We may call such\nrelations functional relations. In other words, when Frege\nasserts \\( f(x) = y\\), we may represent this as asserting that \\(f\\)\nis a functional relation \\(R\\) such that \\(Rxy\\). This generalizes to\n\\( n\\)-place relations for \\(n\\geq2\\). For example, where \\(+\\) is the\nbinary addition function of arithmetic, we may represent the\narithmetic statement \\(2+3 = 5\\) in our language as a claim of the\nform \\(+(2,3,5)\\), where \\(+\\) is taken to be a 3-place functional\nrelation that obeys the condition: \\(+(x,y,z) \\amp +(x,y,w) \\to z =\nw\\). \nThe basic axioms and rules of inference governing statements in our\nsecond-order language are similar to those of the first-order\npredicate calculus with identity, though they’ve been extended\nto apply to claims involving universal quantifiers binding relation\nvariables. Where \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\psi\\), and \\(\\chi\\) are any formulas,\n\\(\\alpha\\) any variable and \\(\\tau\\) any term of the same type as\n\\(\\alpha\\) (i.e., both are object terms or both are \\(n\\)-place\nrelation terms), then the following are the basic axioms and rules of\nsecond-order logic:  \nIn what follows, we shall assume familiarity with the above axioms and\nrules as we derive Frege’s Theorem. As noted, these are\nessentially the same as the axioms for the first-order predicate\ncalculus, except for the addition of laws for the second-order\nquantifiers \\(\\forall F\\) and \\(\\exists F\\) that correspond to the\nlaws governing the first-order quantifiers \\(\\forall x\\) and \\(\\exists\nx\\). \nSome of the above laws are found explicitly in Gg I, though\nexpressed in Frege’s notation. For example, in Gg\nI, §47, we find Frege’s versions of the\nfollowing: \nThese are first introduced, however, in Gg I,\n§§18, 20, 25, and 20, respectively. \nThough Frege essentially had a second-order logic in Gg, his\nrules of inference don’t look as familiar, or as simple, as MP\nand GEN. The reason is that Frege’s rules of inference govern\nnot only his graphical notation for molecular and quantified formulas,\nbut also his special purpose symbols, such as certain lowercase\nletters used as placeholders, certain Gothic letters and letters used\nas bound variables, and various other signs of his system we have not\nyet mentioned. Since Frege’s notation for rules of inference\nwill play no role in the discussion that follows, we shall again\nsimplify our task by not describing it further. \nThe modern second-order predicate calculus includes a\ncomprehension principle that effectively guarantees that there\nexists an \\(n\\)-place relation corresponding to every open formula\nwith \\(n\\) free object variables \\(x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\). We introduce this\nprinciple by considering the following 1-place case: \nComprehension Principle for Concepts: \n\\(\\exists G \\forall x(Gx \\equiv \\phi)\\),  where \\(\\phi\\) is any\nformula in which \\(G\\) doesn't occur free.  \nSimilarly the following is a Comprehension Principle for 2-place\nRelations:  \nComprehension Principle for 2-place Relations: \n\\(\\exists R\\forall x\\forall y(Rxy \\equiv \\phi)\\),  where\n\\(\\phi\\) is any formula in which \\(R\\) doesn't occur free.  \nAlthough Frege didn’t explicitly formulate these comprehension\nprinciples, they are derivable in his system and constitute very\nimportant generalizations within his system that reveal its underlying\ntheory of concepts and relations. We can see these principles at work\nby formulating the following instance of comprehension, where\n‘\\(Ox\\)’ asserts that \\(x\\) is odd: \n\\(\\exists G\\forall x(Gx \\equiv (Ox \\amp x \\gt 5))\\)  \nThis asserts: there exists a concept \\(G\\) such that for every object\n\\(x\\), \\(x\\) falls under \\(G\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is odd and greater\nthan 5. If our second-order language were extended to include the\nprimitive predicates ‘\\(O\\)’ and ‘\\(\\gt\\)’ and\nthe primitive object term ‘5’, then the above instance of\nthe Comprehension Principle for Concepts would be an axiom (and hence,\ntheorem) of second-order logic. \nSimilarly, the following is an instance of the Comprehension Principle\nfor Relations:  \n\\(\\exists R\\forall x\\forall y(Rxy \\equiv (Ox \\amp x \\gt y))\\)  \nThis asserts the existence of a relation that objects \\(x\\) and \\( y\\)\nbear to one another just in case the complex condition \\(Ox \\amp x \\gt\ny\\) holds. \nLogicians nowadays typically distinguish the open formula \\(\\phi\\) in\nwhich the variable \\(x\\) is free from the corresponding name of a\nconcept. For example, they use the notation \\([\\lambda x \\, Ox \\amp x\n\\gt 5]\\) as the name of the complex concept being an \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(x\\) is odd and \\(x\\) is greater than 5 (or, more\nnaturally, ‘being odd and greater than 5’). The\nterm-forming operator \\(\\lambda x\\) (which we read as ‘being an\n\\(x\\) such that’) combines with a formula \\(\\phi\\) in which\n\\(x\\) is free to produce \\([\\lambda x\\,\\phi]\\). The\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expression is a name of the concept expressed by the\nformula \\(\\phi\\). In what follows, the scope of the variable-binding\noperator \\(\\lambda x\\) in \\([\\lambda x\\,\\phi]\\) applies to the entire\nformula \\(\\phi\\), no matter how complex, so that instead of writing,\nfor example, \\([\\lambda x\\,(Ox \\amp x \\gt 5)]\\), we shall simply\nwrite: \\([\\lambda x\\, Ox \\amp x \\gt 5]\\). \nThis notation can be extended for relations. The expression: \n\\([\\lambda xy \\, Ox \\amp x \\gt y]\\)  \nnames the 2-place relation being an \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nsuch that \\(x\\) is odd and \\(x\\) is greater\nthan \\(y\\). \nIt is important to emphasize that Frege didn’t use\n\\(\\lambda\\)-notation. By contrast, he thought that predicative\nexpressions such as ‘(\\(\\, )\\) is happy’ are incomplete\nexpressions and that the concepts they denoted were\nunsaturated. We need not discuss Frege’s reasons for\nthis in this entry, though interested readers may consult his 1892\nessay “Concept and Object”. \nFor the purposes of understanding Frege’s Theorem, we only need\nto introduce one axiom that governs \\(\\lambda\\)-notation, namely, the\nprinciple known as \\(\\lambda \\)-Conversion. Let \\(\\phi\\) be any\nformula and let \\(\\phi^y_x\\) be the result of substituting the\nvariable \\(y\\) for free occurrences of \\(x\\) everywhere in \\(\\phi\\).\nThen the principle of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion is: \n\\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion:\n\n\\(\\forall y([\\lambda x \\, \\phi]y \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\)  \nThis asserts: for any object \\(y\\), \\(y\\) falls under the concept\n\\([\\lambda x \\, \\phi]\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is such that\n\\(\\phi^y_x\\). So, using our example, the following is an instance of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-conversion: \n\\(\\forall y([\\lambda x \\, Ox \\amp x \\gt 5]y \\equiv Oy \\amp y \\gt 5)\\)\n \nThis asserts: for any object \\(y\\), \\(y\\) falls under the\nconcept being odd and greater than 5 if and only if \\(y\\) is\nodd and greater than 5. Note that when the quantified variable \\(y\\)\nis instantiated to some object term, the resulting instance of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion is a biconditional. Thus, among the many\nconsequences of this axiom we find: 6 falls under the\nconcept being odd and greater than 5 if and only if 6 is odd\nand greater than 5 (in this case, the biconditional remains true\nbecause both sides are false).  \nSome logicians call the rule of inference derived from the\nright-to-left direction of such biconditionals\n‘\\(\\lambda\\)-Abstraction’. For example, the inference from\nthe premise:  \n\\(O6 \\amp 6 \\gt 5\\)  \nto the conclusion: \n\\([\\lambda x \\, Ox \\amp x \\gt 5]6\\)  \nis justified by \\(\\lambda\\)-Abstraction. (Here we have a case of a\nvalid inference in which both the premise and the conclusion are both\nfalse.) \nThe principle of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion can be generalized, so that it\ngoverns \\(n\\)-place \\(\\lambda\\)-expressions as well. Here is the\n2-place case: \n\\(\\forall z\\forall w([\\lambda xy\\, \\phi]zw \\equiv \\phi^{z,w}_{x,y})\\)\n \n(In this formula \\(\\phi^{z,w}_{x,y}\\) is the result of simultaneously\nsubstituting \\(z\\) for \\(x\\) and \\(w\\) for \\(y\\) in \\(\\phi\\).) \nThe reader should construct an instance of this principle using our\nexample \\([\\lambda xy \\, Ox \\amp x \\gt y]\\). \nIt should be noted at this point that instead of using comprehension\nprinciples, Frege had a distinguished rule in his system that is\nequivalent to such principles, namely, his Rule of Substitution.\nThough Frege’s Rule of Substitution appears to allow the\nsubstitution of formulas \\(\\phi\\) for free concept variables \\(F\\) in\ntheorems of logic, we can understand this rule in terms of the\nsecond-order logic we’ve defined as follows: in any theorem of\nlogic with a free variable \\(F^{n}\\), one may both substitute any\n\\(n\\)-place \\(\\lambda\\)-expression \\([\\lambda x_{1}\\ldots x_{n}\\,\n\\phi]\\) for \\(F^{n}\\) and then perform \\(\\lambda\\)-conversion. For\nexample, in the second-order system we now have, one can infer\n\\(\\forall x(Ox \\amp x \\gt 5 \\equiv Ox \\amp x \\gt 5)\\) from \\(\\forall\ny(Fy \\equiv Fy)\\) by first substituting \\([\\lambda x \\, Ox \\amp x \\gt\n5]\\) for \\(F\\) and then using \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion on all the\nresulting subformulas containing the \\(\\lambda\\)-expression that flank\nthe \\(\\equiv\\) sign.  Frege’s Rule of Substitution allows one to\ndo all this in one step. Readers interested in learning a bit more\nabout the connection between the Rule of Substitution and\nComprehension Principles described above can consult the following\nsupplementary document: \n\n Frege’s Rule of Substitution\n  \nFinally, it is important to point out that the system we have just\ndescribed, i.e., second-order logic with identity and comprehension\nprinciples, extended with \\(\\lambda\\)-expressions and\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion, is consistent. Its axioms are true even in\nvery small interpretations, e.g., ones in which the domain of objects\ncontains a single object and each domain of \\(n\\)-place relations \\(\n(n\\geq1)\\) has just two relations. For example, if the domain of\nobjects contains a single object, say b, and the domain of\n1-place relations contains two concepts (i.e., one which b\nfalls under and one which nothing falls under), then all of the above\naxioms are true, including the Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nand 1-place \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion. Even so, the system described\nabove requires that every concept has a negation, every pair of\nconcepts has a conjunction, every pair of concepts has a disjunction,\netc. The reader should be able to write down instances of the\ncomprehension principle which demonstrate these claims. \nReaders whose main goal is to understand Frege’s Theorem can now\nskip directly to Section 3. \nThough the present section is not required for understanding the proof\nof Frege’s Theorem, we include it so that the reader can get\nsome sense of how second-order logic (with comprehension) gives rise\nto Russell’s paradox when one adds Frege’s theory of\ncourses-of-values and extensions. Though we shall briefly discuss\nFrege’s notation for courses-of-values, we’ll subsequently\nswitch to simpler notation for naming the extensions of concepts. For\nthe purposes of this section, let us suppose that we have primitive\nfunction terms \\(f\\), \\(g\\), \\(h\\), … in our language and that\nfunctional applications such as \\(f(x)\\), \\(g(y)\\), etc., are\nallowed. \nThe principle that undermined Frege’s system, Basic Law V, was\none that attempted to systematize the notions ‘course-of-values\nof a function’ and ‘extension of a concept’. The\ncourse-of-values of a function \\(f\\) is something like a set of\nordered pairs that records the value \\(f(x)\\) for every argument \\(\nx\\). For example, the course-of-values of the function father of\nx records, among other things, that Bill Clinton is the value of\nthe function when Chelsea Clinton is the argument. The\ncourse-of-values for the function \\(x^2\\) records, among other things,\nthat the number 4 is the value when the number 2 is the argument, that\n9 is the value when 3 is the argument, etc. When a function \\(f\\) is a\nconcept, Frege called the course-of-values for that concept its\nextension. The extension of a concept is something like the\nset of all objects that fall under the concept, for the extension\nrecords all of the objects that the concept maps to The True. For\nexample, the extension of the concept \\(x\\) is a positive even\ninteger less than 8 is something like the set consisting of the\nnumbers 2, 4, and 6. \nFrege introduces primitive notation for courses-of-values in\nGg I, §9. He switched to the lower case Greek\nletters \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) when writing the names of\ncourses-of-values and extensions, and placed smooth breathing marks\nover them to indicate they were variable-binding operators. So: \n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon} f(\\epsilon)\\)  \nand \n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\! g(\\alpha)\\)  \ndesignate the course-of-values of the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\),\nrespectively. In this notation, the symbols \\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\)\nand \\(\\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\) bind the object variables \\(\\epsilon\\)\nand \\(\\alpha\\) in the expressions \\(f(\\epsilon)\\) and \\(g(\\alpha)\\),\nrespectively, and the resulting expression denotes a\ncourse-of-values. \nHere is a pair of examples of Frege’s notation for\ncourses-of-values. This pair of examples comes from Gg\nI, §9. Frege uses the expression: \n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\! (\\epsilon^{2}- \\epsilon)\\)  \nto denote the course-of-values of the function represented by the open\nformula: \n\\(x^{2} - x\\)  \nHe also uses: \n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\! (\\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha - 1))\\)  \nto denote the course-of-values of the function represented by the open\nformula:  \n\\(x \\cdot (x - 1)\\)  \nFrege then notes that if the functions \\(x^{2} - x\\) and \\(x \\cdot (x\n- 1)\\) map the same arguments to the same values, then the extensions\nof those two functions are the same, and vice versa. That is, he notes\nthat: \n\\(\\forall x[x^{2}-x = x \\cdot (x - 1)]\\)  \nholds if and only if:  \n\\({\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}}(\\epsilon^{2} - \\epsilon) =\n{\\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}} (\\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha - 1))\\)  \nThis equivalence will become embodied in Basic Law V. Indeed,\nFrege’s formulation of Basic Law V in Gg I,\n§20 can now be represented in our language (temporarily extended\nwith function terms and functional application) as follows:  \nBasic Law V:\n\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\! f(\\epsilon) \\eqclose \\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\!\ng(\\alpha) \\equivwide \\forall x[f(x) \\eqclose g(x)]\\)  \nThis principle asserts: the course-of-values of the function \\(f\\) is\nidentical to the course-of-values of the function \\(g\\) if and only if\n\\(f\\) and g map every object to the same value. [Actually, Frege uses\nan identity sign instead of the biconditional sign as the main\nconnective of the principle. The reason he could do this is that, in\nhis system, when two sentences are materially equivalent, they\nname the same truth value.] We shall soon see why this\nprinciple is inconsistent.  \nSince concepts, for Frege, are functions that always map their\narguments to a truth value, we may introduce some new notation to help\nus represent Frege’s method of forming names of the extensions\nof concepts. This new notation takes advantage of our\n\\(\\lambda\\)-notation for naming concepts, and so allows us to\nintroduce a new kind of function term where Frege introduced a\nvariable-binding operator. \nLet us stipulate that where \\(\\Pi\\) is any 1-place concept term (name\nor variable), the notation ‘\\(\\epsilon\\Pi\\)’ designates\nthe extension of the concept \\(\\Pi\\). So, for example, \\(\\epsilon F\\)\ndenotes the extension of the concept \\(F\\). Note that 1-place\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expressions of the form \\([\\lambda x\\,\\phi]\\) are 1-place\nconcept terms, and so \\(\\epsilon[\\lambda x\\,\\phi]\\) is well-formed and\ndesignates the extension of the concept \\([\\lambda x\\,\\phi]\\). Thus,\nwhereas Frege used \\(\\stackrel{,}{\\epsilon}\\) as a variable-binding\noperator that binds an object variable in a formula to produce the\nname of an extension, we are using \\(\\epsilon\\) as a term-forming\nfunction symbol that applies to 1-place concept terms to produce terms\ndenoting, or ranging over, objects. Thus, when \\(\\epsilon\\) is\nprefixed to a concept name, the resulting expression is a name of an\nobject, and in particular, a name of the extension of the concept\ndenoted by the concept name. When the \\(\\epsilon\\) is prefixed to a\nconcept variable, e.g., as in \\(\\epsilon F\\), the resulting expression\nis a kind of complex variable that ranges over extensions: for each\nvalue of the variable \\(F\\), \\(\\epsilon F\\) denotes the extension of\n\\(F\\). \nHere is an example of our notation involving a pair of complex\nconcepts. Consider the concept that which when added to 4\nequals 5, or using \\(\\lambda\\)-notation, the following\nconcept: \n\\([\\lambda x \\, x+4 = 5]\\)  \nWe use the following notation to denote the extension of this concept:\n \n\\(\\epsilon[\\lambda x \\, x+4 = 5]\\)  \nNow consider the concept that which when added to \\(2^{2}\\)\nequals 5 (i.e., \\([\\lambda x~x+2^{2} = 5])\\). We use the\nfollowing notation to denote the extension of this concept:  \n\\(\\epsilon[\\lambda x \\, x+2^{2} = 5]\\)  \nNote that it seems natural to identify these two extensions given that\nall and only the objects that fall under the first concept fall under\nthe second. Those readers already familiar with the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-calculus should remember that \\(\\epsilon[\\lambda x~\\phi]\\)\ndenotes an object, that \\([\\lambda x~\\phi]\\) denotes a concept, and\nthat Frege rigorously distinguished objects and concepts and supposed\nthem to constitute mutually exclusive domains. \nIf we remember that the extension of a concept is something like the\nset of objects that fall under the concept, then we could replace\nFrege’s talk of ‘extensions’ by talk of\n‘sets’ and use the following ‘set notation’ to\nrefer to the set of objects that when added to 4 yield 5 and the set\nof objects that when added to \\(2^{2}\\) yield 5, respectively:  \nFrege took advantage of his second-order language to define\nwhat it is for an object to be a member of an extension or set.\nAlthough Frege used the notation \\(x \\cap y\\) to designate the\nmembership relation, we shall follow the more usual practice of using\n\\(x\\in y\\). Thus, the following captures the main features of\nFrege’s definition of membership in Gg I,\n§34: \n\\(x\\in y \\eqdef \\exists G (y\\eqclose \\epsilon G \\amp Gx)\\)  \nIn other words, \\(x\\) is an element of \\(y\\) just in case \\(x\\) falls\nunder a concept of which \\(y\\) is the extension. For example, given\nthis definition, one can prove that John is a member of the extension\nof the concept being happy (formally: \\(j \\in \\epsilon H)\\)\nfrom the premise that John falls under the concept being\nhappy (‘\\(Hj\\)’). Here is a simple proof:  \nSome readers may wish to examine a somewhat more complex example, in\nwhich the above definition of membership is used to prove that 1 \\(\\in\n\\epsilon[\\lambda x \\, x+2^2 = 5]\\) given the premise that \\( 1+2^{2} =\n5\\).\n (A More Complex Example) \nBefore we turn to Basic Law V, it is important to mention an important\nfact about our representation of Frege’s system, in which\nwe’ve introduced the term-forming operator \\(\\epsilon\\) into\nsecond-order logic with identity. The resulting system has the\nfollowing principle, which asserts that every concept has an\nextension, as a theorem: \nExistence of Extensions:\n\n\\(\\forall G\\exists x(x = \\epsilon G)\\)  \nTo see that this is derivable given our work thus far, recall line 2\nof the proof in the above example: the laws of identity allow us to\nassert that: \n\\(\\epsilon F = \\epsilon F\\)  \nIn second-order logic with identity, this is an instance of \\(x = x\\)\n(strictly speaking, one first derives \\(\\forall x(x = x)\\) from the\naxiom \\(x = x\\) by GEN, and then instantiates the universally\nquantified variable \\(x\\) to \\(\\epsilon F\\)). So, by existential\ngeneralization, it follows that: \n\\(\\exists x(x = \\epsilon F)\\)  \nBut now the Existence of Extensions principle follows by universal\ngeneralization on the concept variable \\(F\\). Thus, simply by adding a\nterm-forming operator such as \\(\\epsilon\\) to classical logic with\nidentity, it is provable that every concept gets correlated with an\nextension. Basic Law V will not only imply, but also place a condition\non, this correlation. \nWe can now represent the special case of Frege’s Basic Law V\nthat applies to concepts, using our \\(\\epsilon\\) notation: \nBasic Law V (Special Case):\n\n\\(\\epsilon F\\eqclose \\epsilon G \\equivwide \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)\n \nIn this special case, Basic Law V asserts: the extension of the\nconcept \\(F\\) is identical to the extension of the concept \\(G\\) if\nand only if all and only the objects that fall under \\(F\\) fall under\n\\(G\\) (i.e., if and only if the concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are\nmaterially equivalent). In more modern guise, Frege’s Basic Law\nV asserts that the set of \\(F\\)s is identical to the set of \\(G\\)s if\nand only if \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are materially equivalent: \n\\(\\{x\\mid Fx\\}\\eqclose \\{y\\mid Gy\\} \\equivwide \\forall z(Fz \\equiv\nGz)\\)  \nThe example discussed above can now be seen as an instance of Basic\nLaw V: \nThis asserts that the extension of the concept that which added\nto 4 yields 5 is identical to the extension of the\nconcept that which added to \\(2^{2}\\) yields 5 if\nand only if all and only the objects that when added to 4 yield 5 are\nobjects that when added to \\(2^{2}\\) yield 5. \nThere are two important corollaries to Law V that play a role in what\nfollows: the Law of Extensions and the Principle of Extensionality.\nThe Law of Extensions (cf. Gg I, §55, Theorem 1)\nasserts that an object is a member of the extension of a concept if\nand only if it falls under that concept: \nLaw of Extensions:\n\n\\(\\forall F \\forall x(x \\in\\epsilon F \\equiv Fx)\\)  \n (Derivation of the Law of Extensions) \nBasic Law V also correctly implies the Principle of Extensionality.\nThis principle asserts that if two extensions have the same members,\nthey are identical. Let us define ‘\\(x\\) is an\nextension’ as follows: \n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x) \\eqdef \\exists F (x = \\epsilon F)\\)  \nThen we may formally represent and derive the principle of\nextensionality as follows: \nPrinciple of Extensionality:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Extension}(y) \\to [\\forall z(z\n\\in x\\equiv z\\in y) \\to x\\eqclose y]\\)  \n (Derivation of the Principle of Extensionality) \nThe above facts about Basic Law V will be used in the next subsections\nto show why it may not be consistently added to second-order\nlogic with comprehension. Frege was made aware of the inconsistency by\nBertrand Russell, who sent him a letter formulating\n‘Russell’s Paradox’ just as the second volume of\nGg was going to press. Frege quickly added an\nAppendix to the second volume, describing two distinct ways of\nderiving a contradiction from Basic Law V. He also suggested a way of\nrepairing Law V, but Quine (1995) later showed that such a repair was\ndisastrous, since it would force the domain of objects to contain at\nmost one object. \nIn the next subsections, we describe the two ways of deriving a\ncontradiction from Basic Law V that Frege described in the Appendix to\nGg. The first establishes the contradiction directly, without\nany special definitions. The second deploys the membership relation\nand more closely follows Russell’s Paradox. As we shall see, the\nfollowing combination is a volatile mix: (a) the Comprehension\nPrinciple for concepts, which ensures that there is a concept\ncorresponding to every formula with free variable \\(x\\), (b) the\nExistence of Extensions principle, which ensures every concept is\ncorrelated with an extension, and (c) Basic Law V, which ensures that\nthe correlation of concepts with extensions behaves in a certain\nway. \nIn the Appendix to Gg II, Frege shows that a\ncontradiction can be derived from Basic Law V once we formulate the\nconcept being an x that is the extension of some concept which x\ndoesn’t fall under. We may use the following\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expression to represent this concept:  \n\\([\\lambda x \\, \\exists F (x\\eqclose \\epsilon F \\amp \\neg Fx)]\\)  \nWe know that there exists such a concept, since the open formula in\nthe scope of \\(\\lambda x\\) can be used in the Comprehension Principle\nfor Concepts. Now by the Existence of Extensions principle, the\nfollowing concept exists and is correlated with it:  \n\\(\\epsilon[\\lambda x \\, \\exists F(x\\eqclose \\epsilon F \\amp \\neg\nFx)]\\)  \nIt can now be proved that this extension falls under the concept\n\\([\\lambda x \\, \\exists F(x\\eqclose \\epsilon F \\amp \\neg Fx)]\\) if and\nonly if it does not.  \n (First Derivation of the Contradiction.)\n  \nIn the Appendix to Gg II, Frege also explains how\nBasic Law V implies the existence of the paradoxical Russell set. We\ncan represent his reasoning as follows. From the Law of Extensions\n(which was derived from Basic Law V above), one can establish a Naive\nComprehension Axiom for Extensions in three simple steps. First we\ninstantiate the Law of Extensions to the free variable \\(F\\), to\nyield: \n\\(\\forall x(x \\in \\epsilon F\\equiv Fx)\\)  \nBy existentially generalizing on \\(\\epsilon F\\), it follows that: \n\\(\\exists y\\forall x(x \\in y \\equiv Fx)\\)  \nNow at this point, we may universally generalize on the variable \\(F\\)\nto get the following second-order Naive Comprehension Axiom for\nextensions, which asserts that for every concept \\(F\\), there is an\nextension which has as members all and only the objects that fall\nunder \\(F\\): \nNaive Comprehension Axiom for Extensions:\n\n\\(\\forall F\\exists y\\forall x(x\\in y \\equiv Fx)\\)  \nThe Naive Comprehension Axiom gives rise to Russell’s Paradox\nonce we instantiate the quantified variable \\(F\\) to the concept\n\\([\\lambda z \\, z\\notinclose z]\\), where \\(z \\notinclose z\\) simply\nabbreviates \\(\\neg(z\\in z)\\), to yield: \n\\(\\exists y\\forall x(x\\inclose y \\equiv [\\lambda z \\, z\\notinclose\nz]x)\\)  \nBy \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion, this is equivalent to: \n\\(\\exists y\\forall x(x\\inclose y \\equiv x \\notinclose x)\\)  \n(Note: Frege could have reached this last result in one step from\n\\(\\exists y\\forall x(x\\inclose y \\equiv Fx)\\) using his Rule of\nSubstitution.) \nThe contradiction now goes as follows. Let \\(b\\) be such an object\nasserted to exist by the claim we just derived. So we know:  \n\\(\\forall x(x\\inclose b \\equiv x\\notinclose x)\\)  \nBut we can now instantiate the universally quantified variable to the\nobject \\(b\\) to yield the following contradiction:  \n\\(b\\inclose b \\equiv b\\notinclose b\\)  \n(See the entry\n on Russell’s Paradox.) \nWe’ve now reconstructed the inconsistency in Frege’s\nsystem by representing his logic and Basic Law V in a modern system of\nsecond-order logic. Philosophers have diagnosed the inconsistency in\nvarious ways, and it is safe to say that the matter is still somewhat\ncontroversial. In this subsection, we discuss only the basic elements\nof the problem. Most philosophers and logicians agree that the reason\nsecond-order logic can’t be extended by Basic Law V is that the\nresulting system requires the impossible situation in which the domain\nof concepts has to be strictly larger than the domain of extensions\nwhile at the same time the domain of extensions has to be as large as\nthe domain of concepts. \nTo analyze the inconsistency in more detail, consider\nan extensional model of concepts, in which the material\nequivalence of concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) serves as both necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the identity of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), i.e., in\nwhich \\(F = G \\equiv \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\).  So, given this\nunderstanding, if it is not the case that \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are\nmaterially equivalent, then \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are distinct concepts; and\nif \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are distinct concepts, then they are not materially\nequivalent. \nWith this extensional view of concepts in mind, we can see how a\nparadox is engendered. Recall first that the Existence of Extensions\nprinciple correlates each concept \\(F\\) with an extension \\(\\epsilon\nF\\). Each direction of Basic Law V requires that this correlation have\ncertain properties. We shall see, for example, that the right-to-left\ndirection of Basic Law V (i.e., Va) requires that no concept gets\ncorrelated with two distinct extensions. [Frege uses the label\n‘Vb’ to designate the left-to-right direction of Basic Law\nV, and uses ‘Va’ for a variant of the right-to-left\ndirection. See, for example, Gg I, §52. However,\nmany commentators use ‘Va’ to designate the left-to-right\ndirection. We shall follow Frege’s use, since that will make\nsense of his Appendix to Gg II, in which he discusses\nthe paradoxes by discussing Vb and Va.] We may represent Frege’s\nVa as follows: \nBasic Law Va:\n\n\\(\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx) \\to\\epsilon F = \\epsilon G\\)  \nSo the contrapositive asserts that if \\(\\epsilon F \\neq \\epsilon G\\),\nthen \\(\\neg \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\).  But in the case where the\nmaterial equivalence of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is a necessary condition for\n\\(F = G\\), i.e., in the case where \\(\\neg \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)\nimplies \\(F \\neq G\\), then Va implies that if \\(\\epsilon F \\neq\n\\epsilon G\\), then \\(F \\neq G\\), i.e., that whenever the extensions of\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ, the concepts with which they are correlated,\nnamely \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), differ. This means that the correlation\nbetween concepts and extensions that Basic Law V sets up must be a\nfunction – no concept gets correlated with two distinct\nextensions (though for all Va tells us, distinct concepts might get\ncorrelated with the same extension). Frege noted (in the Appendix\nto Gg II) that this direction of Basic Law V\ndoesn’t seem problematic.  \nHowever, the left-to-right direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Vb) is more\nserious. We may represent Vb as follows: \nBasic Law Vb:\n\n\\(\\epsilon F = \\epsilon G \\to\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)  \nSo the contrapositive asserts that if \\(\\neg \\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\)\nthen \\(\\epsilon F \\neq \\epsilon G\\).  But in the case where the\nmaterial equivalence of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is a sufficient condition for\n\\(F = G\\), i.e., in the case where \\(F \\neq G\\) implies \\(\\neg \\forall\nx(Fx \\equiv Gx)\\), then Vb implies \\(F \\neq G \\to \\epsilon F \\neq\n\\epsilon G\\), i.e., that if concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ, the\nextensions of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) differ. So, the correlation that Basic\nLaw V sets up between concepts and extensions will have to be\none-to-one; i.e., it correlates distinct concepts with distinct\nextensions. Since every concept is correlated with some extension,\nthere have to be at least as many extensions as there are\nconcepts. \nBut the problem is that second-order logic with Basic Law V as a\nwhole requires that there be more concepts than\nextensions. The requirement that there be more concepts than\nextensions is imposed jointly by the Comprehension Principle for\nConcepts and the new significance this principle takes on in\nthe presence of Basic Law V. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nasserts the existence of a concept for every condition on objects\nexpressible in the language. Now although it may seem that this\nprinciple, in and of itself, forces the domain of concepts to be\nlarger than the domain of objects, it is a model-theoretic fact that\nthere are models of second-order logic with the Comprehension\nPrinciple for Concepts (but without Basic Law V) in which the domain\nof concepts is not larger than the domain of\n objects.[2]\n However, the addition of Basic Law V to Frege’s system forces\nthe domain of concepts to be larger than the domain of objects (and so\nlarger than the domain of extensions), due to the endless cycle of new\nconcepts that arise in connection with the new extensions contributed\nby Basic Law V. However, as we saw in the last paragraph, Vb requires\nthat there be at least as many extensions as there are concepts. \nThus, the addition of Basic Law V to second-order logic implies an\nimpossible situation in which the domain of concepts has to be\nstrictly larger than the domain of extensions while at the same time\nthe domain of extensions has to be as large as the domain of\nconcepts. \nRecently, there has been a lot of interest in discovering ways of\nrepairing the Fregean theory of extensions. The traditional view is\nthat one must either restrict Basic Law V or restrict the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts. Recently, Boolos (1986, 1993)\ndeveloped one of the more interesting suggestions for revising Basic\nLaw V without abandoning second-order logic and its comprehension\nprinciple for concepts. On the other hand, there have been many\nsuggestions for restricting the Comprehension Principle for Concepts.\nThe most severe of these is to abandon second-order logic (and the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts) altogether. Schroeder-Heister\n(1987) conjectured that the first-order portion of Frege’s\nsystem (i.e., the system which results by adding Basic Law V to the\nfirst-order predicate calculus) was consistent and this was proved by\nT. Parsons (1987) and Burgess\n (1998).[3]\n Heck (1996), Wehmeier (1999), Ferreira & Wehmeier (2002), and\nFerreira (2005) consider less drastic moves. They investigate systems\nof second-order logic which have been extended by Basic Law V but in\nwhich the Comprehension Principle for Concepts is restricted in some\nway. See also Anderson & Zalta (2004) and Antonelli & May\n(2005) for different approaches to repairing Frege’s system. See\nFine (2002) for a discussion of the limits of Frege’s method and\nsee Burgess (2005) for a good general overview. \nWe will not discuss the above research further in the present entry,\nfor none of these alternatives have achieved a clear consensus.\nInstead, we focus on the theoretical accomplishment revealed by\nFrege’s work in Gg. As noted in the\nIntroduction, Frege validly proved a rather deep fact about the\nnatural numbers notwithstanding the inconsistency of Basic Law V. He\nderived the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory in second-order\nlogic from Hume’s Principle (which was briefly mentioned above\nand which will be discussed in the next section). But this fact went\nunnoticed for many years. Though Geach (1955) claimed such a\nderivation was possible, C. Parsons (1965) was the first to note that\nHume’s Principle was powerful enough for the derivation of the\nDedekind/Peano axioms. Though Wright (1983) actually carried out most\nof the derivation, Heck (1993) showed that although Frege did use\nBasic Law V to derive Hume’s principle, his (Frege’s)\nsubsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory\nfrom Hume’s Principle never made an essential appeal to\nBasic Law V. Since Hume’s Principle can be consistently added to\nsecond-order logic, we may conclude that Frege himself validly derived\nthe basic laws of number theory. It will be the task of the next few\nsections to explain Frege’s accomplishments in this regard. We\nwill do this in two stages. In §3 we study Frege’s attempt\nto derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V by analyzing\ncardinal numbers as extensions. Then, we put this aside in §4 and\n§5 to examine how Frege was able to derive the Dedekind/Peano\naxioms of number theory from Hume’s Principle alone. \nCardinal numbers are the numbers that can be used to answer the\nquestion ‘How many \\(\\ldots\\) are there?’, and Frege\ndiscovered that such numbers bear an interesting relationship to the\nnatural numbers. Frege’s insights concerning this relationship\ntrace back to his work in Gl, in which the notion of\nan extension played very little role. The seminal idea of\nGl §46 was the observation that a statement of\nnumber (e.g., “There are eight planets”) is an assertion\nabout a concept. To explain this idea, Frege noted that one and the\nsame external phenomenon can be counted in different ways; for\nexample, a certain external phenomenon could be counted as 1 army, 5\ndivisions, 25 regiments, 200 companies, 600 platoons, or 24,000\npeople. Each way of counting the external phenomenon corresponds to a\nmanner of its conception. The question “How many are\nthere?” is only properly formulated as the question “How\nmany \\(F\\)s are there?” where a concept \\(F\\) is supplied. On\nFrege’s view, the statements of number which answer such\nquestions (e.g., “There are \\(n\\) \\(F\\)s”) tell us\nsomething about the concept involved. For example, the statement\n“There are eight planets in the solar system” tells us\nthat the ordinary concept planet in the solar system falls\nunder the second-level numerical concept being\nexemplified by eight objects.  \nIn Gl, Frege then moves from this realization, in which\nstatements of numbers are analyzed as predicating second-level\nnumerical concepts of first-level concepts, to develop an account of\nthe cardinal and natural numbers as ‘self-subsistent’\nobjects. He introduces a ‘cardinality operator’ on\nconcepts, namely, ‘the number belonging to the concept \\(\nF\\)’, which designates the cardinal number which numbers the\nobjects falling under \\(F\\). In what follows, we say this more simply\nas ‘the number of \\(F\\)s’ and use the simple notation\n‘\\(\\#F\\)’. Note that the operator # behaves like the\n\\(\\epsilon\\) operator – when it is prefixed to a concept name\nlike planet (\\(P\\)), then \\(\\#P\\) (“the number of\nplanets”) denotes an object; when it is prefixed to a variable\nlike \\(F\\), then \\(\\# F\\) ranges over the domain of objects (for each\nconcept that \\(F\\) can take as a value, \\(\\#F\\) denotes an object\nrelative to that concept). Frege offers both an implicit (i.e.,\ncontextual) and an explicit definition of this operator in\nGl. Both of these definitions require a preliminary\ndefinition of when two concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence or ‘equinumerous’. The notion of\nequinumerosity plays an important and fundamental role in the\ndevelopment of Frege’s Theorem. After developing the definition\nof equinumerosity, we then discuss Frege’s implicit and explicit\ndefinition of the number of \\(F\\)s. Only the former is needed for the\nproof of Frege’s Theorem, however. \nIn order to state the definition of equinumerosity, we shall employ\nthe well-known logical notion ‘there exists a unique \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\phi\\)’. To say that there exists a unique \\(x\\) such\nthat \\(\\phi\\) is to say: there is some \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi\\), and\nanything \\(y\\) which is such that \\(\\phi\\) is identical to \\(x\\). In\nwhat follows, we use the notation ‘\\(\\exists!x\\phi\\)’ to\nabbreviate this notion of a formula being uniquely satisfied, and we\ndefine it formally as follows (where again, \\(\\phi^y_x\\) is the result\nof substituting \\(y\\) for the free occurrences of \\(x\\) in \\(\\phi\\):\n \n\\(\\exists!x\\phi \\eqdef \\exists x[\\phi \\amp\\forall y(\\phi^y_x \\to y =\nx)]\\)  \nNow, in terms of this logical notion of unique existence, we can state\na definition of equinumerosity that is weaker than the one Frege gives\nin Gl (§§71, 72) but which nevertheless does the\njob:[4] \nIn other words, \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are equinumerous just in case there is\na relation that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the\n\\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s. If we let ‘\\(F \\approx G\\)’ stand\nfor equinumerosity, then the definition of this notion can be rendered\nformally as follows:  \nTo see that Frege’s definition of equinumerosity works\ncorrectly, consider the following two examples. In the first example,\nwe have two concepts, \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), that are equinumerous: \nFigure 1 \nAlthough there are several different relations \\(R\\) which demonstrate\nthe equinumerosity of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\), the particular relation used in\nFigure 1 is: \n\\(R_{1} = [\\lambda xy \\, (x\\eqclose a\\amp y\\eqclose f) \\lor (x\\eqclose\nb \\amp y\\eqclose g) \\lor (x\\eqclose c\\amp y\\eqclose e)]\\)  \nIt is a simple exercise to show that \\(R_{1}\\), as defined, is a\n‘witness’ to the equinumerosity of \\(F\\) and \\(G\\)\n(according to the definition). \nIn Figure 2, we have two concepts that are not equinumerous: \nFigure 2 \nIn this example, no relation \\(R\\) can satisfy the definition of\nequinumerosity. \nGiven the discussion so far, it seems reasonable to suggest that\nconcepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) will be equinumerous whenever the number of\nobjects falling under \\(F\\) is identical to the number of objects\nfalling under \\(G\\). This suggestion will be codified by Hume’s\nPrinciple. However, before discussing this principle, the reader\nshould convince him- or herself of the following four facts: (1) that\nthe material equivalence of two concepts implies their equinumerosity,\n(2) that equinumerosity is reflexive, (3) that equinumerosity is\nsymmetric, and (4) that equinumerosity is transitive. In formal terms,\nthe following facts are provable: \nFacts About Equinumerosity:\n\n1. \\(\\forall x(Fx \\equiv Gx) \\to F\\apprxclose G \\)\n\n2. \\(F \\approx F\\)\n\n3. \\(F\\apprxclose G \\to G\\apprxclose F\\)\n\n4. \\(F\\apprxclose G \\amp G\\apprxclose H \\to F\\apprxclose H\\)  \nThe proofs of these facts, in each case, require the identification of\na relation that is a witness to the relevant equinumerosity claim. In\nsome cases, it is easy to identify the relation in question. In other\ncases, the reader should be able to ‘construct’ such\nrelations (using \\(\\lambda\\)-notation) by considering the examples\ndescribed above. Facts (2) – (4) establish that equinumerosity\nis an ‘equivalence relation’ which divides up the domain\nof concepts into ‘equivalence classes’ of equinumerous\nconcepts. \nIn Gl, Frege contextually defined ‘the number of\n\\(F\\)s’ in terms of the principle now known as Hume’s\n Principle:[5] \nHume’s Principle:\n\nThe number of \\(F\\)s is identical to the number of \\(G\\)s if and only\nif \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are equinumerous.  \nUsing our notation ‘\\(\\#F\\)’ to abbreviate ‘the\nnumber of \\(F\\)s’, we may formalize Hume’s Principle as\nfollows:  \nHume’s Principle:\n\n\\(\\#F\\eqclose \\#G \\equiv F \\approx G\\)  \nHume’s Principle is taken to be a contextual definition of\n\\(\\#F\\) when the latter is assumed as a primitive notion governed by\nthe principle: the principle doesn't explicitly define\n‘\\(\\#F\\)’, but contextually defines it by defining\ncontexts (in this case, identity statements) in which it\n occurs.[6]\n As we shall see, Hume's Principle is the basic principle upon which\nFrege forged his development of the theory of natural numbers. In\nGl, Frege sketched the derivations of the basic laws\nof number theory from Hume’s Principle; these sketches were\ndeveloped into more rigorous proofs in Gg I. We will\nexamine these derivations in the following sections. \nOnce Frege had a contextual definition of \\(\\#F\\), he then defined a\ncardinal number as any object which is the number of some concept: \n\\(x \\textit{ is a cardinal number} \\eqdef \\exists F(x = \\#F)\\)  \nThis represents the definition that appears in Gl,\n§72. \nNotice that Hume’s Principle bears an obvious formal resemblance\nto Basic Law V. Both are biconditionals asserting the equivalence of\nan identity among singular terms (the left-side condition) with an\nequivalence relation on concepts (the right-side condition). Indeed,\nboth correlate concepts with certain objects. In the case of\nHume’s Principle, each concept \\(F\\) is correlated with \\(\\#F\\).\nHowever, whereas Basic Law V problematically requires that the\ncorrelation between concepts and extensions be one-to-one,\nHume’s Principle only requires that the correlation between\nconcepts and numbers be many-to-one. Hume’s Principle often\ncorrelates distinct concepts with the same number. For example, the\ndistinct concepts author of Principia Mathematica \n(‘\\([\\lambda x \\, Axp]\\)’)\nand positive integer between 1\nand 4 (‘\\([\\lambda x \\, 1\\lt x\\lt 4]\\)’) are\nequinumerous (both have two objects falling under them). So\n\\(\\#[\\lambda x\\, Axp]\\) = \\(\\#[\\lambda x \\, 1\\lt x\\lt 4]\\). Thus,\nHume’s Principle, unlike Basic Law V, does not require that the\ndomain of numbers be as large as the domain of concepts. Indeed,\nseveral authors have developed models that show Hume’s Principle\ncan be consistently added to second-order logic. See the independent\nwork of Geach (1976, 446–7), Hodes (1984, 138), Burgess (1984)\nand Hazen (1985). \n[Note: The remaining two subsections are not strictly necessary for\nunderstanding the proof of Frege’s Theorem. They are included\nhere for those who wish to have a more complete understanding of what\nFrege in fact attempted to do. They presuppose the material in\n§2. Readers interested in just the positive aspects of\nFrege’s accomplishments should skip directly to §4.] \nBefore we examine the powerful consequences that Frege derived from\nHume’s Principle, it is worth digressing to describe his attempt\nto define ‘\\(\\#F\\)’ explicitly and to derive Hume’s\nPrinciple from Basic Law V. The idea behind this attempt was the\nrealization that if given any concept \\(F\\), the notion of\nequinumerosity can be used to define the second-level concept\nbeing a concept G that is equinumerous to F. Frege found a\nway to collect all of the concepts equinumerous to a given concept\n\\(F\\) into a single extension. In Gl §68, he\ninformally took this to be an extension consisting of first-order\nconcepts by stipulating that the number of \\(F\\)s is the extension of\nthe second-level concept: being a first-level concept equinumerous\nto F. \nIn terms of the example used at the end of the previous subsection,\nthis informal definition identifies the number of the concept\nauthor of Principia Mathematica as the extension consisting\nof all and only those first-level concepts that are equinumerous to\nthis concept; this extension has both \\([\\lambda x \\, Axp]\\) and\n\\([\\lambda x \\, 1\\lt x\\lt 4]\\) as members. Frege in fact identifies\nthe cardinal number 2 with this extension, for it contains all and\nonly those concepts under which two objects fall. Similarly, Frege\nidentifies the cardinal number 0 with the extension consisting of all\nthose first-level concepts under which no object falls; this extension\nwould include such concepts as unicorn, centaur,\nprime number between 3 and 5, etc. Frege’s\ninsight here inspired Russell to develop a somewhat similar definition\nin his work, and it is now common to see references to the so-called\n“Frege-Russell definition of the cardinal numbers” as\nclasses of equinumerous concepts or\n sets.[7]\n Of course, this explicit definition of ‘the number of \\(\nF\\)s’ stands or falls with a coherent conception of\n‘extension’. We know that Basic Law V does not offer such\na coherent conception.  \nFrege’s derivations of Hume’s Principle were invalidated\nby the fact that it appeals to the inconsistent Basic Law V.\nNeverthelss, we briefly describe in this subsection, for interested\nreaders, Frege’s derivations. In Gl, §73,\nFrege sketches an informal proof of the right-to-left direction of\nHume’s Principle using the above informal definition of the\nnumber of \\(F\\)s. The derivation appeals to the fact that a concept\n\\(G\\) is a member of the extension of the second-level concept\nconcept equinumerous to F if and only if \\(G\\) is\nequinumerous to \\(F\\). In other words, the proof relies on a kind of\nhigher-order version of the Law of Extensions (described above), the\nordinary version of which we know to be a consequence of Basic Law\n V.[8]\n Here is a reconstruction of Frege’s proof in\nGl, §73, extended so as to cover both directions\nof Hume’s Principle. \n\n Reconstruction of the Grundlagen Derivation of Hume’s Principle\n  \nHowever, in the development of Gg, Frege didn’t\nformulate the extensions of second-level concepts. In Gg,\nextensions do not contain concepts as members but rather\nobjects. So Frege had to find another way to express the explicit\ndefinition described in the previous subsection. His technique was to\nlet extensions go proxy for their corresponding concepts. Since a full\nreconstruction of this technique and the proof of Hume’s\nPrinciple in Gg would constitute a digression for the\npresent exposition, we shall describe the details for interested\nreaders in a separate document:  \n\n Reconstruction of the Grundgesetze ‘Derivation’ of Hume’s Principle\n  \nInterestingly, Tennant (2004) and May & Wehmeier (forthcoming)\npoint out that in Gg, Frege does not, in actual fact, derive\nHume’s Principle as a biconditional. Instead, he derives both\ndirections separately without combining them or indicating that the\ntwo directions should be conceived as a biconditional. Finally, as\nnoted on several occasions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V\ninvalidated Frege’s derivation of Hume’s Principle. But\nHume’s Principle, in and of itself, is a powerful and consistent\nprinciple. \nIn what follows, we shall suppose that the second-order predicate\ncalculus with which we began has been extended with (a) a primitive\n\\(\\#\\) operator, so that we can formulate terms such as \\(\\#F\\) to\nsignify ‘the number of \\(F\\)s’, and (b) a new axiom,\nnamely, Hume’s Principle, to govern the new terms. As previously\nmentioned, Frege’s Theorem is that the Dedekind/Peano axioms of\nnumber theory are derivable as theorems in a second-order predicate\ncalculus extended in this way. In this section, we introduce the\ndefinitions required for the proof of Frege’s Theorem. In the\nnext section, we go through the proof. In the final section, we\nconclude with a discussion of the philosophical questions that arise\nwhen we extend the predicate calculus in this way, and take\nHume’s Principle as a replacement for Basic Law V. \nBefore we turn to the definitions required for the proof of\nFrege’s Theorem, it would serve well to discuss one other group\nof insights underlying Frege’s analysis of numbers. The first is\nthat the following series of concepts has a rather interesting\nproperty: \nThe interesting property of this series is that for each concept \\(\nC_k\\), all and only the numbers of the concepts preceding\n\\(C_k\\) in the sequence fall under \\(C_k\\). So, for example, the\nconcepts preceding \\(C_3\\) are \\(C_0\\), \\(C_1\\), and \\( C_2\\).\nAccordingly, all and only the following numbers fall under \\(\nC_3:\\#C_0, \\#C_1\\), and \\(\\#C_2\\). \nFrege’ next insight was that these concepts can be used,\nrespectively, to define the finite cardinal numbers, as follows: \nThis insight, however, led to another. Frege realized that though we\nmay identify this sequence of numbers with the natural numbers, such a\nsequence is simply a list: it does not constitute a definition of a\nconcept (e.g., natural number) that applies to all and only\nthe numbers defined in the sequence. Such a concept is required if we\nare to prove as theorems the following axioms of\nDedekind/Peano number theory:  \nMoreover, Frege recognized the need to employ the Principle of\nMathematical Induction in the proof that every number has a successor.\nOne cannot prove the claim that every number has a successor\nsimply by producing the sequence of expressions for cardinal numbers\n(e.g., the second of the two sequences described above). All such a\nsequence demonstrates is that for every expression listed in the\nsequence, one can define an expression of the appropriate form to\nfollow it in the sequence. This is not the same as proving that \nevery natural number has a successor. \nTo accomplish these further goals, Frege proceeded\n(Gl, §76, and Gg I, §43)\nby defining the concept \\(x\\) (immediately) precedes\n\\(y\\):  \nWe may represent Frege’s definition formally in our language as\nfollows: \nTo illustrate this definition, let us temporarily assume that we know\nsome facts about the natural numbers 1 and 2 to show that the\ndefinition properly predicts that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(1,2)\\), even\nthough we haven’t yet defined these natural numbers. Let the\nexpression ‘\\([\\lambda z \\,\nAzp]\\)’ denote the concept\nauthor of Principia Mathematica. Only Bertrand Russell\n(‘\\(r\\)’) and Alfred Whitehead fall under this concept.\nLet the expression ‘\\([\\lambda z \\, Azp \\amp\nz\\neqclose r]\\)’ denote the concept author of\nPrincipia Mathematica other than\nRussell.[9]\nThen the following may, for the purposes of this example, be taken as\nfacts:  \nIf we assemble these truths into a conjunction and apply existential\ngeneralization in the appropriate places, the result is the definiens\nof the definition of predecessor instantiated to the numbers 1 and 2.\nThus, if given certain facts about the number of objects falling under\nthe certain concepts, the definition of predecessor correctly predicts\nthat \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(1,2)\\). \nFrege next defines the relation x is an ancestor of y in the\nR-series. This new relation is called ‘the ancestral of the\nrelation R’ and we henceforth designate this relation\nas \\(R^*\\). Frege first defined the ancestral of a relation R\nin Begr (Part III, Proposition 76), though the word\n‘ancestral’ comes to us from Russell and Whitehead.\nFrege’s phrase for the ancestral is: “\\(x\\) comes before\n\\(y\\) in the \\(R\\)-series”; alternatively, “\\(y\\) follows\n\\(x\\) in the \\(R\\)-series”. (See also Gl, §79,\nand Gg I, §45.) The intuitive idea is easily\ngrasped if we consider the relation \\(x\\) is the father of\n\\(y\\). Suppose that \\(a\\) is the father of \\(b\\), that \\(b\\) is the\nfather of \\(c\\), and that \\(c\\) is the father of \\(d\\). Then\n‘\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the fatherhood-series’\nis defined so that \\(a\\) is an ancestor of \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\),\nthat \\(b\\) is an ancestor of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), and that \\(c\\) is an\nancestor of \\(d\\). \nFrege’s definition of the ancestral of R requires a preliminary\ndefinition: \nF is hereditary in the R-series if and only if every pair of\n\\(R\\)-related objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are such that \\(y\\) falls under\n\\(F\\) whenever \\(x\\) falls under \\(F\\)  \nIn formal terms:  \n\\(\\mathit{Her}(F,R) \\eqabbr \\forall x\\forall y(Rxy \\to (Fx \\to Fy))\\)\n \nIntuitively, the idea is that \\(F\\) is hereditary in the\nR-series if \\(F\\) is always ‘passed along’ from\n\\(x\\) to \\(y\\) whenever \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are a pair of\nR-related objects. (We warn the reader here that the notation\n‘\\(\\mathit{Her}(F,R)\\)’ is merely an abbreviation of a\nmuch longer statement. It is not a formula of our language\nhaving the form ‘\\(R(x,y)\\)’. In what follows, we\nsometimes introduce other such abbreviations.) \nFrege’s definition of the ancestral of \\(R\\) can now be stated\nas follows: \nx comes before y in the R-series \\(\\eqdef\\) y falls\nunder all those R-hereditary concepts F under which\nfalls every object to which x is R-related.  \nIn other words, \\(y\\) follows \\(x\\) in the R-series whenever \\(y\\)\nfalls under every R-hereditary concept \\(F\\) that is\nexemplified by everything immediately R-related to \\(x\\). In\nformal terms:  \n\\(R^*(x,y) \\eqdef \\forall F[(\\forall z(Rxz \\to Fz) \\amp\n\\mathit{Her}(F,R)) \\to Fy]\\)  \nFor example, Clinton’s father stands in the relation father*\nof (i.e., forefather) to Chelsea because she falls under\nevery hereditary concept that Clinton and his brother inherited from\nClinton’s father. However, Clinton’s brother is not one of\nChelsea’s forefathers, since he fails to be her father, her\ngrandfather, or any of the other links in the chain of fathers from\nwhich Chelsea descended. \nIt is important to grasp the differences between a relation \\(R\\) and\nits ancestral \\(R^*\\). Rxy implies \\(R^*(x,y)\\) (e.g., if\nClinton is a father of Chelsea, then Clinton is a forefather of\nChelsea), but the converse doesn’t hold (Clinton’s father\nis a father* of Chelsea, but he is not a father of Chelsea). Indeed, a\ngrasp of the definition of \\(R^*\\) should leave one able to prove the\nfollowing easy consequences, many of which correspond to theorems in\nBegr and\n Gg:[10] \nFacts About \\(R^*\\): \nThe reader should consider what happens when \\(R\\) is taken to be the\nrelation (immediately) precedes. Appealing to our\nintuitive grasp of the numbers, we can say that it is an instance of\nFact (1) that if 10 precedes 11, then 10 precedes* 11. Moreover,\nprecedes is a witness to Fact 2: that 10 precedes* 12 does not imply\nthat 10 precedes 12. The transitivity of precedes* is an instance of\nFact (7). Below, when we restrict ourselves to the natural numbers, it\nbecomes intuitive to think of the difference between precedes and\nprecedes* as the difference between immediately precedes and\nless-than.  \nGiven the notion of the ancestral of relation \\(R\\), Frege then\ndefines its weak ancestral, which he termed “\\(y\\) is a member\nof the \\(R\\)-series beginning with \\(x\\)” (cf.\nBegr, Part III, Proposition 99; Gl,\n§81, and Gg I, §46): \nIn formal terms:  \n\\(R^{+}(x,y) \\eqdef R^*(x,y) \\lor x\\eqclose y\\)  \nFrege would also read \\(R^{+}(x,y)\\) as: \\(x\\) is a member of the\nR-series ending with \\(y\\). Logicians call \\(R^{+}\\) the\n‘weak-ancestral’ of \\(R\\) because it is a weakened version\nof \\(R^*\\). When we define the natural numbers below, and take \\(R\\)\nto be precedes, we can intuitively regard its weak ancestral,\nprecedes\\(^{+}\\), as the relation\nless-than-or-equal-to on the natural numbers.  \nThe general definition of the weak ancestral of \\(R\\) yields the\nfollowing facts, many of which correspond to theorems in\n Gg:[12] \nFacts About \\(R^{+}\\): \nThe proofs of these facts are left as exercises.  \nFrege’s definition of natural number requires one more\npreliminary definition. Frege identified the number 0 as the number of\nthe concept being non-self-identical. That is:  \n\\(0 \\eqdef \\#[\\lambda x \\, x\\neq x]\\)  \nSince the logic of identity guarantees that no object is\nnon-self-identical, nothing falls under the concept being\nnon-self-identical. Had Frege’s explicit definition of the\n\\(\\#F\\) worked as he had intended, the number 0 would, in effect, be\nidentified with the extension consisting of all those extensions of\nconcepts under which nothing falls. However, for the present purposes,\nwe may note that 0 is defined in terms of (a) the primitive notion\n‘the number of \\(F\\)s’ and (b) a concept \\(([\\lambda x \\,\nx\\neq x])\\) whose existence is guaranteed by our second-order logic\nwith identity and comprehension. It is straightforward to prove the\nfollowing Lemma Concerning Zero from this definition of 0:  \nLemma Concerning Zero:\n\n\\(\\#F\\eqclose 0 \\equivwide \\neg\\exists xFx\\)  \n (Proof of Lemma Concerning Zero) \nNote that the proof appeals to Hume’s Principle and facts about\nequinumerosity. \nFrege’s definition of the concept natural number can\nnow be stated in terms of the weak-ancestral of Predecessor: \nx is a natural number if and only if \\(x\\) is a member of the\npredecessor-series beginning with 0  \nThis definition appears in Gl, §83, and\nGg I, §46 as the definition of ‘finite\nnumber’. Indeed, the natural numbers are precisely the finite\ncardinals. In formal terms, Frege’s definition becomes:  \n\\(Nx ~ \\eqdef ~ \\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x)\\)  \nIn what follows, we shall sometimes use the variables \\(m\\), \\(n\\),\nand \\(o\\) to range over the natural numbers. In other words,\nwe’ll use formulas of the form \\(\\forall n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\) to\nabbreviate formulas of the form \\(\\forall x(Nx \\to \\ldots x\\ldots)\\),\nand use formulas of the form \\(\\exists n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\) to\nabbreviate formulas of the form \\(\\exists x(Nx \\amp \\ldots\nx\\ldots)\\). \nFrege’s Theorem is that the five Dedekind/Peano axioms for\nnumber theory can be derived from Hume’s Principle in\nsecond-order logic. In this section, we reconstruct the proof of this\ntheorem; it can be extracted from Frege’s work using the\ndefinitions and theorems assembled so far. Some of the steps in this\nproof can be found in Gl. (See the Appendix to Boolos\n1990 for a reconstruction.) Our reconstruction follows Frege’s\nGg in spirit and in most details, but we have tried\nto simplify the presentation in several places. For a stricter\ndescription of Frege’s Gg proof, the reader is\nreferred to Heck 1993. The following should help prepare the reader\nfor Heck’s excellent essay. \nThe statement that zero is a natural number is an immediate\nconsequence of the definition of natural number: \nTheorem 1:\n\n\\(N0\\)  \nProof: It is a simple consequence of the definition of\n‘weak ancestral’ that \\(R^{+}\\) is reflexive (see Fact 4\nabout \\(R^{+}\\) in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4).\nSo \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,0)\\). Hence, by the definition of natural\nnumber, \\(0\\) is a natural number. \nIt seems that Frege never actually identified this fact explicitly in\nGl or labeled this fact as a numbered Theorem in\nGg I. \nIt is also a simple consequence of the foregoing that 0 doesn’t\nsucceed any natural number. This can be represented formally as\nfollows:  \nTheorem 2:\n\n\\(\\neg\\exists x(Nx \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,0))\\) \nProof: Assume, for reductio, that some number, say\n\\(n\\), is such that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(n,0)\\). Then, by the\ndefinition of predecessor, it follows that there is a concept, say\n\\(Q\\) and an object, say \\(c\\), such that \\(Qc \\amp 0\\eqclose \\#Q \\amp\nn\\eqclose \\#[\\lambda z\\, Qz \\amp z\\neq c]\\). But by the Lemma\nConcerning Zero (above), \\(0 = \\#Q\\) implies \\(\\neg\\exists xQx\\),\nwhich contradicts the fact that \\(Qc\\). \nSee Gl, §78, Item (6); and Gg\nI, §109, Theorem 126. \nThe fact that no two natural numbers have the same successor is\nsomewhat more difficult to prove (cf. Gl, §78,\nItem (5); Gg I, §95, Theorem 89). We may\nformulate this theorem as follows, with \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(o\\) as\nrestricted variables ranging over the natural numbers:  \nTheorem 3:\n\n\\(\\forall m\\forall n\\forall o[\\mathit{Precedes}(m,o)\\amp\n\\mathit{Precedes}(n,o) \\to m = n]\\)  \nIn other words, this theorem asserts that predecessor is a one-to-one\nrelation on the natural numbers. To prove this theorem, it suffices to\nprove that predecessor is a one-to-one relation full stop. One can\nprove that predecessor is one-to-one from Hume’s Principle, with\nthe help of the following Equinumerosity Lemma, the proof of which is\nrather long and involved. The Equinumerosity Lemma asserts that when\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are equinumerous, \\(x\\) falls under \\(F\\), and \\( y\\)\nfalls under \\(G\\), then the concept object falling under F other\nthan x is equinumerous to the concept object falling under G\nother than \\(y\\). The picture is something like this:  \nFigure 3 \nIn terms of Figure 3, the Equinumerosity Lemma tells us that if there\nis a relation \\(R\\) which is a witness to the equinumerosity of \\( F\\)\nand \\(G\\), then there is a relation \\(R'\\) which is a witness to the\nequinumerosity of the concepts that result when you restrict \\( F\\)\nand \\(G\\) to the objects other than \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively.\n \nTo help us formalize the Equinumerosity Lemma, let \\(F^{-x}\\)\nabbreviate the concept \\([\\lambda z \\, Fz \\amp z\\neq x]\\) and let\n\\(G^{-y}\\) abbreviate the concept \\( [\\lambda z \\, Gz \\amp z \\neq\ny]\\). Then we have: \nEquinumerosity Lemma:\n\n\\(F\\apprxclose G \\amp Fx \\amp Gy \\to F^{-x}\\apprxclose G^{-y}\\)  \n (Proof of Equinumerosity Lemma) \nNow we can prove that Predecessor is a one-to-one relation from this\nLemma and Hume’s Principle (cf. Gg I,\n§108):  \nPredecessor is One-to-One:\n\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z[\\mathit{Precedes}(x,z) \\amp\n\\mathit{Precedes}(y,z) \\to x\\eqclose y] \\)  \nProof: Assume that both a and b are precedessors of \\(c\\). By\nthe definition of predecessor, we know that there are concepts and\nobjects \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(d\\), and \\(e\\), such that: \nBut if both \\(c = \\#P\\) and \\(c = \\#Q\\), then \\(\\#P = \\#Q\\). So, by\nHume’s Principle, \\(P \\approx Q\\). So, by the Equinumerosity\nLemma, it follows that \\(P^{-d} \\approx Q^{-e}\\). If so, then by\nHume’s Principle, \\(\\#P^{-d} = \\#Q^{-e}\\). But then, \\(a =\nb\\). \nSo, if Predecessor is a one-to-one relation, it is a one-to-one\nrelation on the natural numbers. Therefore, no two numbers have the\nsame successor. This completes the proof of Theorem 3. \nIt is important to mention here that not only is Predecessor a\none-to-one relation, it is also a functional relation: \nPredecessor is a Functional Relation:\n\n\\(\\forall x\\forall y\\forall z[\\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\\amp\n\\mathit{Precedes}(x,z)\\to y\\eqclose z]\\)  \nThis fact can be proved with the help of a kind of converse to the\nEquinumerosity Lemma:  \nEquinumerosity Lemma ‘Converse’:\n\n\\(F^{-x}\\apprxclose G^{-y} \\amp Fx \\amp Gy \\towide F\\apprxclose G\\)\n \nWe leave the proof of the Equinumerosity Lemma ‘Converse’\nand the proof of Predecessor is a Functional Relation as exercises for\nthe reader. \nLet us say that a concept \\(F\\) is hereditary on the natural\nnumbers just in case every ‘adjacent’ pair of numbers\n\\(n\\) and \\(m\\) (\\(n\\) preceding \\(m\\)) is such that \\(m\\) falls under\n\\(F\\) whenever \\(n\\) falls under \\(F\\), i.e., \n\\(\\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \\eqabbr \\forall n\\forall\nm[\\mathit{Precedes}(n,m)\\to (Fn \\to Fm)]\\)  \nThen we may state the Principle of Mathematical Induction as follows:\nif (a) \\(0\\) falls under \\(F\\) and (b) \\(F\\) is hereditary on the\nnatural numbers, then every natural number falls under \\(F\\). In\nformal terms: \nTheorem 4: Principle of Mathematical\nInduction:\n\n\\(F0 \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \\to \\forall n Fn\\)  \nFrege actually proves the Principle of Mathematical Induction from a\nmore general principle that governs any \\(R\\)-series whatsoever. We\nwill call the latter the General Principle of Induction. It asserts\nthat whenever a falls under \\(F\\), and \\(F\\) is hereditary on the\n\\(R\\)-series beginning with \\(a\\), then every member of that\n\\(R\\)-series falls under \\(F\\). We can formalize the General Principle\nof Induction with the help of a strict understanding of\n‘hereditary on the \\(R\\)-series beginning with \\(a\\)’.\nHere is a definition: \nIn other words, \\(F\\) is hereditary on the members of the \\(R\\)-series\nbeginning with \\(a\\) just in case every adjacent pair \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nin this series (with \\(x\\) bearing \\(R\\) to \\(y\\)) is such that \\(y\\)\nfalls under \\(F\\) whenever \\(x\\) falls under \\(F\\). Now given this\ndefinition, we can reformulate the General Principle of Induction more\nstrictly as:  \nGeneral Principle of Induction:\n\n\\([Fa \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{a}R^{+})] ~\\to~ \\forall x[R^{+}(a,x)\n\\to Fx]\\)  \nThis is a version of Frege’s Theorem 152 in Gg\nI, §117. \nWe may sketch the proof strategy as follows. Assume that the\nantecedent of the General Principle of Induction holds for an\narbitrarily chosen concept, say \\(P\\). That is, assume: \n\\(Pa \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(P, {}^{a}R^{+})\\)  \nNow to show \\(\\forall x(R^{+}(a,x) \\to Px)\\), pick an arbitrary\nobject, say \\(b\\), and further assume \\(R^{+}(a,b)\\). We then simply\nhave to show \\(Pb\\). We do this by invoking Fact (7) about \\(R^{+}\\)\n(in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4). Recall that Fact\n(7) is:  \n\\([Fx \\amp R^{+}(x,y) \\amp \\mathit{Her}(F,R)] \\to Fy\\)  \nThis is a theorem of logic containing the free variables \\(x\\), \\(y\\),\nand \\(F\\). First, we instantiate \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\),\nrespectively. Then, we instantiate \\(F\\) to the concept \\([\\lambda z\n\\, R^{+}(a,z) \\amp Pz]\\) and apply \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion (though\nFrege could simply use his Rule of Substitution to achieve the same\ninference). The concept being instantiated for \\(F\\) is the concept\nmember of the R-series beginning with a and which falls under\nP. The result of instantiating the free variables in Fact (7) and\nthen applying \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion yields a rather long conditional,\nwith numerous conjuncts in the antecedent and the claim that \\(Pb\\) in\nthe consequent. Thus, if the antecedent can be established, the proof\nis done. For those following along with pencil and paper, all of the\nconjuncts in the antecedent are things we already know, with the\nexception of the claim that \\([\\lambda z \\, R^{+}(a,z)\\amp Pz]\\) is\nhereditary on \\(R\\). However, this claim can be established\nstraightforwardly from things we know to be true (and, in particular,\nfrom facts contained in the antecedent of the Principle we are trying\nto prove, which we assumed as part of our conditional proof). The\nreader is encouraged to complete the proof as an exercise. For those\nwho would like to check their work, we give the complete Proof of the\nGeneral Principle of Induction here:  \n\n Proof of the General Principle of Induction\n  \nNow to derive Principle of Mathematical Induction from the General\nPrinciple of Induction, we formulate an instance of the latter by\nsetting \\(a\\) to \\(0\\) and \\(R\\) to Precedes: \n\\({[}F0 \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{0}\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}){]} \\towide\n\\forall x{[}\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x) \\to Fx{]}\\)  \nWhen we expand the defined notation for \\(\\mathit{HerOn}\\), substitute\nthe notation \\(Nx\\) and \\(Ny\\) for \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x)\\) and\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,y)\\), respectively, and then employ our\nrestricted quantifiers \\(\\forall n(\\ldots n\\ldots)\\) and \\(\\forall\nm(\\ldots m\\ldots)\\) for the claims of the form \\(\\forall y(Ny \\to\n\\ldots y\\ldots)\\) and \\(\\forall x(Nx \\to \\ldots x\\ldots)\\),\nrespectively, the result is the Principle of Mathematical Induction\n(in which the notation \\(\\mathit{HerOn}(F,N)\\) has been eliminated in\nterms of its definiens).  \nFrege uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that every\nnatural number has a successor that's a natural number. We may\nformulate the theorem as follows: \nTheorem 5:\n\n\\(\\forall x{[}Nx \\to \\exists y(Ny \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)){]}\\)\n \nTo reconstruct Frege’s strategy for proving this theorem, recall\nthat the weak ancestral of the Predecessor relation, i.e.,\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(x,y)\\), can be read as: \\(x\\) is a member of\nthe predecessor-series ending with \\(y\\). Frege then considers the\nconcept member of the predecessor-series ending with n, i.e.,\n\\([\\lambda z \\, \\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)]\\), where \\(n\\) is a\nnatural number. Frege then shows, by induction, that every natural\nnumber \\(n\\) precedes the number of the concept member of the\npredecessor-series ending with n. That is, Frege proves that\nevery natural number has a successor by proving the following Lemma on\nSuccessorsby induction: \nLemma on Successors:\n\n\\(\\forall n \\mathit{Precedes}(n,\\#[\\lambda z \\,\n\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)])\\)  \nThis asserts that every natural number \\(n\\) precedes the number of\nnumbers in the predecessor series ending with \\(n\\). Frege can\nestablish Theorem 5 by proving the Lemma on Successors and by showing\nthat the successor of a natural number is itself a natural number. \nTo see an intuitive picture of why the Lemma on Successors gives us\nwhat we want, we may temporarily regard \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\) as\nthe relation ≤. (One can prove that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\) has\nthe properties that ≤ has on the natural numbers.) Although we\nhaven’t yet assigned any meaning to the numerals ‘1’\nand ‘2’, the following intuitive sequence is driving\nFrege’s strategy: \nFor example, the third member of this sequence is true because there\nare 3 natural numbers (0, 1, and 2) that are less than or equal to 2;\nso the number 2 precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to\n2. Frege’s strategy is to show that the general claim, that\n\\(n\\) precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to \\(n\\),\nholds for every natural number. So, given this intuitive understanding\nof the Lemma on Successors, Frege has a good strategy for proving that\nevery number has a successor. (For the remainder of this subsection,\nthe reader may wish to continue to think of \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\)\nin terms of \\(\\leq\\).) \nNow to prove the Lemma on Successors by induction, we need to\nreconfigure this Lemma to a form which can be used as the consequent\nof the Principle of Mathematical Induction; i.e., we need something of\nthe form \\(\\forall n\\, Fn\\). We can get the Lemma on Successors into\nthis form by ‘abstracting out’ a concept from the Lemma\nusing the right-to-left direction of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion (i.e.,\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Abstraction) to produce the following equivalent statement\nof the Lemma: \n\\(\\forall n [\\lambda y \\, \\mathit{Precedes}(y, \\#[\\lambda z \\,\n\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]n\\)  \nThe concept ‘abstracted out’ is the following: \n\\([\\lambda y\\, \\mathit{Precedes}(y,\\#[\\lambda z \\,\n\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]\\)  \nThis is the concept: being an object \\(y\\) which precedes\nthe number of the concept: member of the predecessor series ending\nin \\(y\\). Let us abbreviate the \\(\\lambda\\)-expression that\ndenotes this concept as ‘\\(Q\\)’. Our strategy is to\ninstantiate the variable \\(F\\) in the Principle of Mathematical\nInduction to \\(Q\\). The result is therefore something that has been\nproved and that we therefore know to be true:  \n\\(Q0 \\amp \\mathit{HerOn}(Q,N) \\to \\forall nQn\\)  \nSince the consequent is the reconfigured Lemma on Successors, Frege\ncan prove this Lemma by proving both that \\(0\\) falls under \\(Q\\) (cf.\nGg I, Theorem 154) and that \\(Q\\) is hereditary on\nthe natural numbers (cf. Gg I, Theorem 150):  \n\n Proof that \\(0\\) falls under \\(Q\\)\n  \n\n Proof that \\(Q\\) is hereditary on the natural numbers\n  \nGiven this proof of the Lemma on Successors, Theorem 5 is not far\naway. The Lemma on Successors shows that every number precedes some\ncardinal number of the form \\(\\#F\\). We still have to show that such\nsuccessor cardinals are natural numbers. That is, it still remains to\nbe shown that if a number \\(n\\) precedes something \\(y\\), then \\(y\\)\nis a natural number:  \nSuccessors of Natural Numbers are Natural Numbers:\n\n\\(\\forall n\\forall y (\\mathit{Precedes}(n,y) \\to Ny)\\) \nProof: Suppose that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(n,a)\\). Then, by\ndefinition, since \\(n\\) is a natural number,\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,n)\\). So by Fact (3) about \\(R^{+}\\) (in the\nsubsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4), it follows that\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,a)\\), and so by the definition of\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\\), it follows that\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,a)\\); i.e., \\(a\\) is a natural number. \nTheorem 5 now follows from the Lemma on Successors and the fact that\nsuccessors of natural numbers are natural numbers. With the proof of\nTheorem 5, we have completed the proof of Frege’s Theorem.\nBefore we turn to the last section of this entry, it is worth\nmentioning the mathematical significance of this theorem.  \nFrom Frege’s Theorem, one can derive arithmetic. It is an\nimmediate consequence Theorem 5 and the fact that Predecessor is a\nfunctional relation that every number has a unique successor.\nThat means we can define the successor function by adding definite\ndescriptions of the form ‘the \\(x\\) such that \\(\\phi\\)’ to\nour language: \n\\(n' \\eqdef\\) the \\(x\\) such that \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(n,x)\\)  \nWe may then define the sequence of natural numbers succeeding \\(0\\) as\nfollows: \nMoreover, the recursive definition of addition can now be given:  \nWe may also officially define: \nThese definitions constitute the foundations of arithmetic. Frege has\nthus insightfully derived the basic laws of arithmetic from\nHume’s Principle in second-order logic. (Readers interested in\nhow these results are affected when Hume’s Principle is combined\nwith predicative second-order logic should consult Linnebo\n2004.) \nAs we've now seen, the proof of Frege’s Theorem can be carried\nout independently of the portion of Frege’s system which led to\ninconsistency. Frege himself never identified “Frege’s\nTheorem” as a “result”. As previously noted, he\nattempted to derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V in\nGg, but once the contradiction became known to him,\nhe never officially retreated to the ‘fall-back’ position\nof claiming that the proof of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from\nHume’s Principle alone constituted an important result. One of\nseveral reasons why he didn’t adopt this fall-back position is\nthat he didn’t regard Hume’s Principle as a sufficiently\ngeneral principle – he didn’t believe it was strong\nenough, from an epistemological point of view, to help us answer the\nquestion, “How are numbers given to us?”. We discuss the\nthinking behind this attitude, and other things, in what follows. \nA discussion of the philosophical questions surrounding Frege’s\nTheorem should begin with some statement of how Frege conceived of his\nown project when writing Begr, Gl,\nand Gg. It seems clear that epistemological\nconsiderations in part motivated Frege’s work on the foundations\nof mathematics. It is well documented that Frege had the following\ngoal, namely, to explain our knowledge of the basic laws of arithmetic\nby giving an answer to the question “How are numbers\n‘given’ to us?” without making an appeal to the\nfaculty of intuition. If Frege could show that the basic laws of\nnumber theory are derivable from analytic truths of logic, then he\ncould argue that we need only appeal to the faculty of understanding\n(as opposed to some faculty of intuition) to explain our knowledge of\nthe truths of arithmetic. Frege’s goal then stands in contrast\nto the Kantian view of the exact mathematical sciences, according to\nwhich general principles of reasoning must be supplemented by a\nfaculty of intuition if we are to achieve mathematical knowledge. The\nKantian model here is that of geometry; Kant thought that our\nintuitions of figures and constructions played an essential role in\nthe demonstrations of geometrical theorems. (In Frege’s own\ntime, the achievements of Frege’s contemporaries Pasch, Pieri\nand Hilbert showed that such intuitions were not essential.) \nFrege’s strategy then was to show that no appeal to intuition is\nrequired for the derivation of the theorems of number theory. This in\nturn required that he show that the latter are derivable using only\nrules of inference, axioms, and definitions that are purely analytic\nprinciples of logic. This view has become known as\n‘Logicism’. Here is what Frege says:  \n[Begr, Preface, p. 5:]\n\nTo prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed, I had\nto bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps.\n[from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort 1967] \n[Begr, Part III, §23:]\n\nThrough the present example, moreover, we see how pure thought,\nirrespective of any content given by the senses or even by an\nintuition a priori, can, solely from the content that results\nfrom its own constitution, bring forth judgements that at first sight\nappear to be possible only on the basis of some intuition. \\(\\ldots\\)\nThe propositions about sequences [\\(R\\)-series] in what follows far\nsurpass in generality all those that can be derived from any intuition\nof sequences. [from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort\n1967] \n[Gl, §62:]\n\nHow, then, are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have any ideas\nor intuitions of them? Since it is only in the context of a\nproposition that words have any meaning, our problem becomes this: To\ndefine the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs. [from\nthe Austin translation in Frege 1974] \n[Gl, §87:]\n\nI hope I may claim in the present work to have made it probable that\nthe laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a\npriori. Arithmetic thus becomes simply a development of logic, and\nevery proposition of arithmetic a law of logic, albeit a derivative\none. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1974] \n[Gg I, §0:]\n\nIn my Grundlagen der Arithmetik, I sought to make it\nplausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any\nground of proof whatever from either experience or intuition. In the\npresent book, this shall be confirmed, by the derivation of the\nsimplest laws of Numbers by logical means alone. [from the Furth\ntranslation in Frege 1967] \n[Gg II, Appendix:]\n\nThe prime problem of arithmetic is the question, In what way are we to\nconceive logical objects, in particular, numbers? By what means are we\njustified in recognizing numbers as objects? Even if this problem is\nnot solved to the degree I thought it was when I wrote this volume,\nstill I do not doubt that the way to the solution has been found.\n[from the Furth translation in Frege 1967] \nThe basic problem for Frege’s strategy, however, is that for his\nlogicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include\n(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the\nexistence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious\nhow to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential\nstatements. Given the above discussion, it should be clear that Frege\nat some point in Gg endorsed existence claims, either directly\nin his formalism or in his metalanguage, for the following entities:\n \nAlthough Frege attempted to reduce the latter two kinds of entities\n(truth-values and numbers) to extensions, the fact is that the\nexistence of concepts and extensions are derivable from his Rule of\nSubstitution and Basic Law V, respectively. \nIn light of these existence claims, a Kantian might well suggest not\nonly that explicit existence claims are synthetic rather than analytic\n(i.e., aren’t true in virtue of the meanings of the words\ninvolved) but also that since the Rule of Substitution and Basic Law V\nimply existence claims, Frege cannot claim that such principles are\npurely analytic principles of logic. If the Kantian is right, then\nsome other faculty (such as intuition) might still be needed to\naccount for our knowledge of the existence claims of arithmetic. \nBoolos (1985) noted that the Rule of Substitution causes a problem of\nthis kind for Frege’s program given that it is equivalent the\nComprehension Principle for Concepts. Boolos suggests a defense for\nFrege with respect to this particular aspect of his logic, namely, to\nreinterpret (by paraphrasing) the second-order quantifiers so as to\navoid commitment to concepts. (See Boolos (1985) for the details.)\nBoolos’s suggestion, however, is one which would require Frege\nto abandon his realist theory of concepts. Moreover, although\nBoolos’s suggestion might lead us to an epistemological\njustification of the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it\ndoesn’t do the same for the Comprehension Principle for\nRelations, for his reinterpretation of the quantifiers works only for\nthe ‘monadic’ quantifiers (i.e., those ranging over\nconcepts having one argument) and thus doesn’t offer a\nparaphrase for quantification over relational concepts. \nAnother problem for a strategy of the type suggested by Boolos is that\nif the second-order quantifiers are interpreted so that they do not\nrange over a separate domain of entities, then there is nothing\nappropriate to serve as the denotations of \\(\\lambda\\)-expressions.\nAlthough Frege wouldn’t quite put it this way, our\nreconstruction suggests that Frege treats open formulas with free\nobject variables as if they denoted concepts. Although Frege\ndoesn’t use \\(\\lambda\\)-notation, the use of such notation seems\nto be the most logically perspicuous way of reconstructing his work.\nThe use of such notation faces the same epistemological puzzles that\nFrege’s Rule of Substitution faces. \nTo see why, note that the Principle of \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion: \n\\(\\forall y([\\lambda x\\, \\phi ]y \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\)  \nseems to be an analytic truth of logic. It says this:  \nAn object \\(y\\) exemplifies the complex property being such\nthat \\(\\phi\\) if and only if \\(y\\) is such that \\(\\phi\\).  \nOne might argue that this is true in virtue of the very meaning of the\n\\(\\lambda\\)-expression, the meaning of \\(\\equiv\\), and the meaning of\nthe statement \\([\\lambda x\\, \\phi]y\\) (which has the form \\( Fx)\\).\nHowever, \\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion also implies the Comprehension\nPrinciple for Concepts, for the latter follows from the former by\nexistential generalization:  \n\\(\\exists F\\forall y(Fy \\equiv \\phi^y_x)\\)  \nThe point here is that the fact that an existential claim is derivable\ncasts at least some doubt on the purely analytic status of\n\\(\\lambda\\)-Conversion. The question of how we obtain knowledge of\nsuch principles is still an open question in philosophy. It is an\nimportant question to address, since Frege’s most insightful\ndefinitions are cast using quantifiers ranging over concepts and\nrelations (e.g., the ancestrals of a relation) and it would be useful\nto have a philosophical explanation of how such entities and the\nprinciples which govern them become known to us. In contemporary\nphilosophy, this question is still poignant, since many philosophers\ndo accept that properties and relations of various\nsorts exist. These entities are the contemporary analogues of\nFrege’s concepts. \nThough the existence of extensions falls right out of the theory of\nidentity (§2.3) once terms of the form \\(\\epsilon F\\) are added\nto second-order logic, the existence of extensions that are correlated\none-to-one with concepts is a consequence of Basic Law V. The question\nfor Frege’s project, then, is why should we accept as a law of\nlogic a statement that implies the existence of individuals and a\ncorrelation of this kind? Frege recognized that Basic Law V’s\nstatus as a logical law could be doubted:  \nMoreover, he thought that an appeal to extensions would answer one of\nthe questions that motivated his work:  \nNow it is unclear why Frege thought that he could answer the question\nposed here by saying that we apprehend numbers as the extensions of\nconcepts. He seems to think we can answer the obvious next question\n“How do we apprehend extensions?” by saying “by way\nof Basic Law V”. \n\nHis idea here seems to be that since Basic Law V is supposed to be\npurely analytic or true in virtue of the meanings of its terms, we\napprehend a pair of extensions whenever we truly judge that concepts\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are materially equivalent. Some philosophers do argue\nthat certain\nconsistent principles having the same logical form as Basic\nLaw V are analytic, and that such principles justify\nreference to the entities described in the left-side\ncondition by grounding such reference in the truth of the\nright-side\n condition.[14] \nWhy did Frege think that Basic Law V is analytic and that the material\nequivalence of concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is analytically equivalent to\nan identity that implies the existence of extensions? To hold that\nBasic Law V is analytic, it seems that one must hold that the\nright-side condition implies the corresponding left-side condition as\na matter of\n meaning.[15]\n This view, however, can be questioned. Suppose the right hand\ncondition implies the left-side condition as a matter of meaning. That\nis, suppose that (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning: \nNow note that (L) itself can be analyzed, from a logical point of\nview. The expression ‘\\(\\epsilon F\\)’, though constructed\nfrom a term-forming operator, is really a definite description\n(‘the extension of \\(F\\)’) and so, using\nRussell’s theory of descriptions, (L) can be logically analyzed\nas the claim:  \nThere is an object \\(x\\) and an object \\(y\\) such that:\n\n(1) \\(x\\) is a unique extension of \\(F\\),\n\n(2) \\(y\\) is a unique extension of \\(G\\), and\n\n(3) \\(x = y\\).  \nThat is, for some defined or primitive notion\n\\(\\mathit{Extension}(x,F)\\) (‘\\(x\\) is an extension of\n\\(F\\)’), (L) implies the analysis (D) as a matter of\nmeaning: \nBut if (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning, and (L) implies (D) as\na matter of meaning, then (R) implies (D) as a matter of meaning. This\nconclusion can be questioned: why should the material equivalence of\n\\(F\\) and \\(G\\) imply the existence claim (D) as a matter of meaning?\nIn other words, the suggestion that Va (i.e., the right-to-left\ndirection of Basic Law V) is analytic leads to a question that has no\nobvious answer. Below, this line of reasoning will be adapted to\nquestion the analyticity of the right-to-left direction of\nHume’s Principle. See Boolos 1997 (307–309), for reasons\nwhy \\(Vb\\) (the left-to-right direction of Hume’s Principle) is\nnot analytic.] \nThe moral to be drawn here is that, even if Basic Law V were\nconsistent, it is not exactly clear how its right side analytically\nimplies the existence of extensions. In the end, we may need some\nother way of justifying our knowledge of principles like Basic Law V,\nthat imply the existence of abstract objects – the justification\ndiscussed so far seems to contain a gap. Even if we follow Frege in\nconceiving of extensions as ‘logical objects’, the\nquestion remains: how can the claims that such objects exist be true\non logical or analytic grounds alone? We might agree that there must\nbe logical objects of some sort if logic is to have a subject matter,\nbut if Frege is to achieve his goal of showing that our knowledge of\narithmetic is free of intuition, then at some point he has to address\nthe question of how we can know that numbers exist. We’ll return\nto this issue in the final subsection. \nGiven that the proof of Frege’s Theorem makes no appeal to Basic\nLaw V, some philosophers have argued Frege’s best strategy for\nproducing an epistemologically-justified foundation for arithmetic is\nto replace the primitive term \\(\\epsilon F\\) with the primitive term\n\\(\\#F\\), replace Basic Law V with Hume’s Principle, and argue\nthat Hume’s Principle is an analytic principle of\n logic.[16]\n However, we have just seen one reason why such a strategy does not\nsuffice. The claim that Hume’s Principle is an analytic\nprinciple of logic is subject to the same problem just posed for Basic\nLaw V. A reason must be given as to why the claim: \n\\(F \\approx G\\)  \nimplies, as a matter of meaning, that: \n\\(\\#F = \\#G\\)  \nAfter all, the statement “\\(\\#F = \\#G\\)” is analyzable in\na manner analogous to the way we analyzed “\\(\\epsilon F =\n\\epsilon G\\)” in the previous section, where we used\nRussell’s theory of description to analyze the sentence (L) as\nthe sentence (D). Following that pattern, we take the primitive notion\n\\(\\mathit{Numbers}(x,F)\\) and analyze \\(\\#F = \\#G\\) as: \nIt is not clear why we should think that this last claim is implied by\n\\(F \\approx G\\) as a matter of meaning. The right-to-left direction of\nHume’s Principle is not obviously analytic. \nMoreover, Frege had his own reasons for not replacing Basic Law V with\nHume’s Principle. One reason was that he thought Hume’s\nPrinciple offered no answer to the epistemological question,\n‘How do we grasp or apprehend logical objects, such as the\nnumbers?’. A second reason is that Hume’s Principle is\nclearly subject to ‘the Julius Caesar problem’. Frege\nfirst raises this problem in connection with an inductive definition\nof ‘\\(n = \\#F\\)’ that he tries out in Gl,\n§55. Concerning this definition, Frege says: \nFrege raises this same concern again for a contextual definition that\ngives a ‘criterion of identity’ for the objects being\ndefined. In Gl §66, Frege considers the\nfollowing contextual definition of ‘the direction of line\n\\(x\\)’:  \nWith regard to this definition, Frege says:  \nNow trouble for Hume’s Principle begins to arise when we\nrecognize that it is a contextual definition that has the same logical\nform as this definition for directions. It is central to Frege’s\nview that the numbers are objects, and so he believes that it\nis incumbent upon him to say which objects they are. But the\n‘Julius Caesar problem’ is that Hume’s Principle, if\nconsidered as the sole principle offering identity conditions for\nnumbers, doesn’t describe the conditions under which an\narbitrary object, say Julius Caesar, is or is not to be identified\nwith the number of planets. That is, Hume’s Principle\ndoesn’t define the condition ‘\\(\\#F = x\\)’, for\narbitrary \\(x\\). It only offers identity conditions when \\(x\\) is an\nobject known to be a cardinal number (for then \\(x = \\#G\\), for some\n\\(G\\), and Hume’s Principle tells us when \\(\\#F = \\#G\\)). \nIn Gl, Frege solves the problem by giving his\nexplicit definition of numbers in terms of extensions. (We described\nthis in §4 above.) Unfortunately, this is only a stopgap measure,\nfor when Frege later systematizes extensions in Gg,\nBasic Law V has the same logical form as Hume’s Principle and\nthe above contextual definition of directions. Frege is aware that the\nJulius Caesar problem affects Basic Law V, as the discussion in\nGg I, §10 shows. In that section, he says\n(remembering that for Frege, \\(\\epsilon\\) binds object variables and\nis not a function term): \nIn other words, Basic Law V does not tell us the conditions under\nwhich an arbitrarily chosen object \\(x\\) may be identified with some\ngiven extension, such as \\(\\epsilon F\\). \nUntil recently, it was thought that Frege solved this problem in\n§10 by restricting the universal quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) of his\nGg system so that it ranges only over extensions. If\nFrege could have successfully restricted this quantifier to\nextensions, then when the question arises, whether (arbitrarily\nchosen) object \\(x\\) is identical with \\(\\epsilon F\\), one could\nanswer that \\(x\\) has to be the extension of some concept, say \\( G\\),\nand that Basic Law V would then tell you the conditions under which\n\\(x\\) is identical to \\(\\epsilon F\\). On this interpretation of\n§10, Frege is alleged to have restricted the quantifiers when he\nidentified the two truth values (The True and The False) with the two\nextensions that contain just these objects as members, respectively.\nBy doing this, it was thought that all of the objects in the range of\nhis quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) in Gg become extensions\nwhich have been identified as such, for the truth values were the only\ntwo objects of his system that had not been introduced as extensions\nor courses of value. \nHowever, recent work by Wehmeier (1999) suggests that, in §10,\nFrege was not attempting to restrict the quantifiers of his system to\nextensions (nor, more generally, to courses-of-values). The extensive\nfootnote to §10 indicates that Frege considered, but did not hold\nmuch hope of, identifying every object in the domain with the\nextension consisting of just that\n object.[17]\n But, more importantly, Frege later considers cases (in\nGg, Sections 34 and 35) which seem to presuppose that\nthe domain contains objects which aren’t extensions. (In these\nsections, Frege considers what happens to the definition of ‘\\(\nx\\) is a member of \\(y\\)’ when \\(y\\) is not an\n extension.)[18] \nEven if Frege somehow could have successfully restricted the\nquantifiers of Gg to avoid the Julius Caesar problem,\nhe would no longer have been able to apply his system by extending it\nto include names of ordinary non-logical objects. For if he were to\nattempt to do so, the question, “Under what conditions is\n\\(\\epsilon F\\) identical with Julius Caesar?”, would then be\nlegitimate but have no answer. That means his logical system could not\nbe used for the analysis of ordinary language. But it was just the\nanalysis of ordinary language that led Frege to his insight that a\nstatement of number is an assertion about a concept. \nEven when we replace the inconsistent Basic Law V with the powerful\nHume’s Principle, Frege’s work still leaves two questions\nunanswered: (1) How do we know that numbers exist?, and (2) How do we\nprecisely specify which objects they are? The first question arises\nbecause Hume’s Principle doesn’t seem to be a purely\nanalytic truth of logic; if neither Hume’s Principle nor the\nexistential claim that numbers exist is analytically true, by what\nfaculty do we come to know (the truth of) the existential claim? The\nsecond question arises because the Julius Caesar problem applies to\nHume's Principle; without a solution to that problem, Frege can't\nclaim to have precisely specified which objects the numbers are, so as\nto delineate them within the domain of all logical and non-logical\nobjects? So questions about the very existence and identity of numbers\nstill affect Frege’s work. \nThese two questions arise because of a limitation in the logical form\nof these Fregean biconditional principles such as Hume’s\nPrinciple and Basic Law V. These contextual definitions combine two\njobs which modern logicians now typically accomplish with separate\nprinciples. A properly reformulated theory of ‘logical’\nobjects should have separate principles: (1) one or more principles\nwhich assert the existence of logical objects, and (2) a\nseparate identity principle which asserts the conditions under which\nlogical objects are identical. The latter should specify\nidentity conditions for logical objects in terms of their most salient\ncharacteristic, one which distinguishes them from other objects. Such\nan identity principle would then be more specific than the global\nidentity principle for all objects (Leibniz’s Law) which asserts\nthat if objects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) fall under the same concepts, they are\nidentical. \nBy way of example, consider modern set theory. Zermelo set theory \\(\n(Z)\\) has several distinctive set existence principles. For example,\nconsider the well-known Subset (or Separation) Axiom: \nSubset (Separation) Axiom of Z:\n\n\\(\\forall x[\\mathit{Set}(x) \\to \\exists y[\\mathit{Set}(y) \\amp \\forall\nz(z \\in y \\equiv (z \\in x \\amp \\phi))]]\\),\n\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) is any formula in which \\(y\\) isn’t free  \nThe Subset Axiom and the other set existence axioms in Z are distinct\nfrom Z’s identity principle for sets: \nIdentity Principle for Sets:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Set}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Set}(y) \\to [\\forall z(z \\in x \\equiv z\n\\in y) \\to x\\eqclose y]\\)  \nNote that the second principle offers identity conditions in terms of\nthe most salient features of sets, namely, the fact that they, unlike\nother objects, have members. The identity conditions for objects which\naren’t sets, then, can be the standard principle that\nidentifies objects whenever they fall under the same concepts. This\nleads us naturally to a very general principle of identity for any\nobjects whatever: \nNow, if something is given to us as a set and we ask whether\nit is identical with an arbitrarily chosen object \\(x\\), this\nspecifies a clear condition that settles the matter. The only\nquestions that remain for the theory \\(Z\\) concern its existence\nprinciple: Do we know that the Subset Axiom and other set existence\nprinciples are true, and if so, how? The question of existence is thus\nlaid bare. We do not approach it by attempting to justify a principle\nthat implies the existence of sets via definite descriptions which we\ndon’t yet know to be well-defined. \nIn some classic essays (1987 and 1986), Boolos appears to recommend\nthis very procedure of using separate existence and identity\nprinciples. In those essays, he eschews the primitive mathematical\nrelation of set membership and suggests that Frege could formulate his\ntheory of numbers (‘Frege Arithmetic’) by using a single\nnonlogical comprehension axiom which employs a special\ninstantiation relation that holds between a concept \\(G\\) and an\nobject \\(x\\) whenever, intuitively, \\(x\\) is an extension consisting\nsolely of concepts and \\(G\\) is a concept ‘in’ \\(x\\). He\ncalls this nonlogical axiom ‘Numbers’ and uses the\nnotation ‘\\(Gηx\\)’ to signify that \\(G\\) is in\n\\(x\\): \nNumbers:\n\n\\(\\forall F\\exists !x\\forall G(Gηx \\equiv G\\approx F)\\)  \n[See Boolos 1987 (5), 1986 (140).] This principle asserts that for any\nconcept \\(F\\), there is a unique object which contains in it all and\nonly those concepts \\(G\\) which are equinumerous to \\(F\\). Boolos then\nmakes two observations: (1) Frege can then define \\(\\#F\\) as\n“the unique object \\(x\\) such that for all concepts \\(G\\), \\(G\\)\nis in \\(x\\) iff \\(G\\) is equinumerous to \\(F\\)”, and (2)\nHume’s Principle is derivable from Numbers. [See Boolos 1986\n(140).] Given these observations, we know from our work in\n§§4 and 5 above that Numbers suffices for the derivation of\nthe basic laws of arithmetic. \nSince Boolos calls this principle ‘Numbers’, it is no\nstretch to suppose that he would accept the following reformulation\n(in which ‘\\(\\mathit{Number}(x)\\)’ is an undefined,\nprimitive notion): \nNumbers:\n\n\\(\\forall F\\exists !x [\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\forall G(Gηx\n\\equiv G\\approx F)]\\)  \nThough Boolos doesn’t explicitly formulate an identity principle\nto complement Numbers, it seems clear that the following principle\nwould offer identity conditions in terms of the most distinctive\nfeature of numbers: \nIdentity Principle for Numbers:\n\n\\(\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Number}(y) \\to [\\forall G(Gηx\n\\equiv Gηy) \\to x\\eqclose y]\\)  \nIt is then straightforward to formulate a general principle of\nidentity, as we did in the case of the set theory \\(Z\\):  \nThis formulation of Frege Arithmetic, in terms of Numbers and the\nGeneral Principle of Identity, puts the Julius Caesar problem\n(described above) into better perspective; the condition ‘\\(\\#F\n= x\\)’ is defined for arbitrary concepts \\(F\\) and objects\n\\(x\\). It openly faces the epistemological questions head-on: Do we\nknow that Numbers is true, and if so, how? This is where philosophers\nneed to concentrate their energies. [For a reconstruction of Frege\nArithmetic with a more general version of the special instantiation\nrelation η, see Zalta 1999.]  \nBy replacing Fregean biconditionals such as Hume’s Principle\nwith separate existence and identity principles, we reduce two\nproblems to one and and isolate the real problem for Fregean\nfoundations of arithmetic, namely, the problem of giving an\nepistemological justification for distinctive existence claims (e.g.,\nNumbers) for abstract objects of a certain kind. For if anything like\nFrege’s program is to succeed, it must at some point assert (as\nan axiom or theorem) the existence of (logical) objects of some kind.\nThose separate existence claims should be the focus of attention.","contact.mail":"zalta@stanford.edu","contact.domain":"stanford.edu"}]
