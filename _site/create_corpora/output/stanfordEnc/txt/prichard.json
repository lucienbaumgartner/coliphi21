D. Ross, E. F. Carritt (a pupil of\nPrichard’s) and H. W. B. Joseph. These men, together with C. D.\nBroad and A. C. Ewing, who worked at Cambridge, have come to be known\nas the British Intuitionists.\n\n Born in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett\nPrichard (a solicitor) and his wife Lucy, Harold Prichard attended\nClifton College in Bristol and was admitted to New College, Oxford to\nstudy mathematics. But after taking First Class honours in\nmathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he\nstudied Greats (ancient history and philosophy) taking First Class\nHonours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against\nCambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a\nfirm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he\nspent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of Hertford College\n(1895–8) and then of Trinity College (1898–1924). He took\nearly retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of temporary\nill-health, but recovered and was elected to the White’s Professorship\nof Moral Philosophy in 1928. He retired in 1937 and died in 1947. \n\nPrichard is mainly known for his work in moral philosophy, but the\nfirst of his very few publications were in epistemology. His main\nintellectual debt was to his teacher John Cook Wilson, whose thinking\ncentered on topics in epistemology and what would now be called\nphilosophical logic, rather than in ethics. In 1909 Prichard published\nhis only book, Kant’s Theory of Knowledge, which was an\naccount of Kant’s Transcendental Idealism. This book criticized\nKant severely, and Prichard acknowledges that his main arguments\nagainst Kant originated from Cook Wilson. The book’s main\nconclusion is that ‘Knowledge is sui generis and\ntherefore a ‘theory’ of knowledge is impossible. Knowledge\nis knowledge, and any attempt to state it in terms of something else\nmust end in describing something which is not knowledge’ (p.\n245). This view that a ‘theory’ of knowledge is impossible\nhas its analogue in Prichard’s later argument that there can be\nno philosophical account of moral obligation of the sort that moral\nphilosophers have traditionally tried to provide. \n\nCook Wilson’s influence is also evident in Prichard’s argument against\nKant’s view that we cannot know things in themselves, but only know\nthem as they present themselves, or appear, to us. Prichard inherits\nfrom Cook Wilson the view that any state of mind that affects the\nnature of its presentations cannot be knowledge.  Knowledge can only\nbe of what it does not affect; its object must be entirely\nindependent. In Kant’s terms, then, the only possible objects of\nknowledge are things in themselves. Appearances, assuming that they\nare objects, cannot be known at all, but must be the object of some\nother state of mind. \n\nBut appearances are not objects. When two lines appear to converge,\nthere is, we might say, an appearance of convergence here, but we\nshould not understand this as the two lines presenting a appearance\nthat is convergent. Appearances can be neither convergent, nor\ndivergent; and they cannot be parallel either. More generally, spatial\nproperties cannot be properties of appearances, since no appearance\ncan be great or small, square or round, bent or straight. Prichard\ntherefore thinks of the noun ‘appearance’ is a source of\nconfusion, because it leads us to think of appearances as objects with\ntheir own ‘phenomenal’ properties, and thereby to ascribe\nto them properties that really belong (or perhaps only appear to\nbelong) to the object that so appears. Having fallen victim to this\nmistake, we then make the further mistake of supposing that we can\nnever cognize objects as they are, but only as they appear to be, and\nwe understand this last as cognition of the appearances rather than of\nthe objects. But an object can of course be the way it appears to be,\nand when it is, its so appearing makes it possible for us to know that\nit is so. So in knowing how things appear we sometimes know how they\nare - indeed, how they are ‘in themselves’. \n\nThe view that knowledge must be of what is independent is the second\nprong of Prichard’s persistent attacks on the notion of a sense-datum\n(and thereby on Russell, Moore and Price). A sense-datum, he says, is\nsupposed to be something of whose existence we know in every case of\nperception. But sense-data are not supposed to have an independent\nexistence, and therefore the very conception of a sense-datum involves\na contradiction. As Prichard came to see it, the basic mistake made by\ndefenders of a sense-datum theory is that of supposing that perceiving\nis a form of knowing; all the other errors flow from this (Prichard\n1938; see also his 1909, p. 99). \n\nPrichard continued to work and to lecture on topics in epistemology,\nin particular perception. He gave lectures on Modern Philosophy\n(Descartes, Locke, Berkeley and Hume) every year for the first five\nyears of his tenure of the White’s Professorship. Indeed he\nlectured as often on these topics as on moral philosophy. He wrote on\nthe perception of movement and the apprehension of time. He said,\ncharacteristically, that ‘the hearing a sound – a sound\nhaving as such a duration – and in general what is called the\nperceiving anything which has a duration – is absolutely\nunderivative and cannot be resolved into anything else’\n(Knowledge and Perception ed. Ross, 48). I cannot resist\nquoting also a passage from a lecture on perception which was not\npublished in Prichard’s lifetime, with the warning that Prichard\nwas known to trail his coat in lectures, in the hope of generating\nlively discussion (ibid., 59–60). ‘For as soon as\nwe compare our states or processes of seeing with one another or with\nother states or processes of perceiving we have to allow that we do\nnot see bodies. For example, it is certain that if\nwe see bodies we in some cases see a body move, but it is also\ncertain that we cannot possibly ever see a body move; for in\nspite of what the followers of Einstein say, motion is, and is always\nreally thought of as, absolute, relative motion being a contradiction\nin terms. (I should like, incidentally, but without any sense of\nshame, to offer this statement as a specimen of one of the few\nstatements of things which we can really be said to know.)\nAnd, motion being absolute, when we are said to be seeing a body move,\nwe cannot possibly be really doing so, since a stationary body would\npresent precisely the same appearance to us, provided our body was\nmoving in a certain way, so that in that case we should be seeing a\nbody move although in fact it was stationary.’ \n\nPrichard was renowned in Oxford (and not only among philosophers)\nfor the simplicity and clarity of his writing style, though he\npublished so little of what he wrote. There are also occasional moments\nof wry humour such as his comment in a commemorative piece on Joseph:\n‘His best memorial, unlike that of many other teachers, perhaps\nconsists in the books that his pupils refrained from writing.’\nPrichard is standing here in a venerable Oxford tradition of not\npublishing oneself and discouraging others either by example and\nprecept (Cook Wilson, Prichard – but not in fact Joseph) or by\nfear (Austin). Prichard’s daughter wrote: ‘My father was\nalways so reluctant to publish’ (quoted in MacAdam 2002, xv). \n\nFinally, some anecdotes and personal testimony: \n\nAustin was much impressed by Prichard, whom he thought the most\nrigorous and minute thinker in Oxford (Berlin, 1973, 2). J. O. Urmson\ntold me that Austin had attended Prichard’s lectures as an\nundergraduate in the early 1930s, sat right at the front and asked very\nmany questions. Eventually Prichard wrote to Austin’s tutor in\nBalliol (I’m not sure who that was), asking him to persuade\nAustin either not to ask so many questions, or not to attend at all.\nBut Austin did neither of these things. Urmson himself wrote ‘As\na member of the very last generation of undergraduates to attend\nPrichard’s lectures and informal instruction, I learnt to admire\nhis patience as a teacher, his philosophical acuity and, above all, his\nquite exceptional intellectual honesty and independence.’ (This\nis in his introduction to his Prichard collection, reprinted in\nMacAdam, p. x.) \n\nC. D. Broad called Prichard ‘a man of immense ability whom I\nhave always regarded as the Oxford Moore’ (Cheney 1971, 14). It\nis also worth reporting Broad’s remarks about Prichard’s\nexamination of T. H. Green: ‘Seldom can the floor have been more\nthoroughly wiped with the remains of one who was at one time commonly\nregarded as a great thinker and who still enjoys a considerable\nreputation in some circles’ (1950, 557). The realist backlash\nagainst nineteenth century Oxford Idealism was complete. \n\nWittgenstein came to speak in Oxford in 1947, just before Prichard’s\ndeath. He had said he did not want to read a paper, but was willing to\nrespond to a paper given by some agreeable student. O. P. Wood, who\nwas still an undergraduate (at Corpus Christi) was set up as the fall\nguy, and read a paper on the Cogito. Wittgenstein, using the\npaper as a springboard for his own ideas, responded at\nlength. Prichard made several interventions, on each occasion very\ndeliberately mispronouncing Wittgenstein’s name as\nWhittgensteen. Finally he rose again and said, in his high reedy voice\n‘Mr. Whittgensteen, Mr. Whittgensteen, you have not answered the\nquestion. Cogito ergo sum – I think therefore I am. Is\nit true, Mr Whittgensteen, is it true – I think therefore I\nam?’. Wittgenstein, exasperated, turned very icy and replied\n‘I think this is a very foolish old man; so I am –\nwhat?’. (This story comes from Peter Hacker, who heard it\nfrom two people who were there, J. O. Urmson and H. L. A. Hart. Hart\nthought that Wittgenstein’s reply was brilliant repartee; Urmson\nthought it unforgivably rude.) \n\n[All simple page references from now on will be to the MacAdam 2002\nedition of Prichard’s work.] \n\nPrichard starts where many moral philosophers never tread: from an\naccount of what an act is. For him, an act is the origination of a\nstate of affairs. That is, to act is to originate a state of affairs.\nThe agent is the originator. \n\nWhat makes an act, so conceived, either right or wrong? Prichard\nholds that the rightness of an act is ‘constituted’ by a\ncombination of two things: \n\nWhat this means is that a right act is made right by such a\ncombination of features. An example might be that of an act made right\nby being the origination of a certain change, say, the educating of a\nyoung person, and the relation between the agent and that person, say,\nhis being her parent. However Prichard is pretty catholic about what is\nto count as a relation, since he allows common humanity to count as\nsuch: ‘the obligation not to hurt the feelings of another\ninvolves no special relation of us to that other, i.e. no relation\nother than that of our both being men, and men in one and the same\nworld’ (13). So a ‘definite’ relation need not be a\n‘special’ relation.  There is a question what Prichard meant to exclude by his claim\nabout what constitutes the rightness of an act. One thing he\ndefinitely meant to exclude was that an act can be made right merely\nby the goodness of its consequences. He argues (216–17) that\nthis alone cannot be sufficient to constitute an act as right. Take an\nact whose consequence will be an increase in someone’s patience, which\nis good. If that someone is oneself, one has a duty to do it, Prichard\nclaims; if it is someone else, one also has a duty to act in that way\nbut it is a different duty. So the mere goodness of the consequence is\ninsufficient to render an act a duty. We need also to know what the\nrelevant ‘definite relation’ is. \n\nAs it stands, however, all this is compatible with the view that the\nrightness of an act is (at least capable of being) constituted by this\ncombination: \n\nBut in my view this reading of Prichard is wrong; it would involve\ntwo mistakes. The first, less subtle but still enticing, is to suppose\nthat the value of the state of affairs originated is at least part of\nwhat we would now call the ‘ground’ of the relevant duty\n– part of what makes the action a duty. The second, more subtle,\nis to suppose that the phrase ‘state of affairs originated’\nrefers to the consequences of the action rather than to the nature of\nthe action itself. I will comment on the first of these supposed\nmistakes immediately, and on the second later.  One might be forgiven for thinking that Prichard is a sort of\nagent-relative consequentialist. He says that ‘unless the effect\nof an act were in some way good, there would be no obligation to\nproduce it, i.e. the goodness of the thing produced is a\npresupposition of the obligation to produce it’ (2). And he says\nthat a moral principle specifies two things, (a) a good thing which\nthe action will produce and (b) a definite relation…’\n(4). And in his most famous published article he writes ‘At best\nit can only be maintained that there is this element of truth in the\nUtilitarian view, that unless we recognized that something which an\nact will originate is good, we should not recognize that we ought to\ndo the action’ (10). I take it, however, that it is one thing to\nspecify as part of the ground something that is good, and another to\nsay that its goodness is itself part of the ground, and that\nPrichard’s choice of the word ‘presupposition’ was well\nadvised. (Not all necessary conditions for the rightness of an act are\nparts of the ground for that rightness; consider the role of the fact\nthat there is nothing else that one should be doing instead.) And I\nwould offer in support of this reading the following sentence from the\nsame paper: ‘we do not come to appreciate an obligation by an\nargument, i.e.  by a process of non-moral thinking, and in particular\nwe do not do so by an argument of which a premiss is the ethical but\nnot moral activity of appreciating the goodness either of the act or\nof a consequence of the act, i.e. our sense of the rightness of an act\nis not a conclusion from our appreciation of the goodness either of it\nor of anything else’ (13-14). Note the words ‘a\npremiss’ in this sentence. \n\nWhy did Prichard reject all such appeals to value? I think his main\npoint is similar in style to the main ‘argument’ of\nBerkeley’s Principles §3. ‘Suppose we ask ourselves whether\nour sense that we ought to pay our debts or to tell the truth arises\nfrom our recognition that in doing so we would be originating something\ngood … We at once and without hesitation answer\n“No”’ (10). But he does try to support this claim by\nargument. For instance, it might be held that the reasoning that runs\n‘This would be the repayment of a debt, and one which I\nvoluntarily incurred; so I ought to do it’ is actually\nenthymematic, and properly runs ‘This would be the repayment of a\ndebt, and one which I voluntarily incurred; such a result would be\ngood; so I ought to do it’. But Prichard says that there is\nnothing much wrong with the original reasoning, and that the expanded\nversion is actually worse, since it appeals to an unsound principle,\nthat what is good ought to be. The principle is unsound because the\nidea of ‘ought to be’ does not make sense; what makes sense\nis ‘I ought to do it’. But we can only derive ‘I\nought to do it’ by means of a principle that what is good ought\nto be, and another that if something ought to be, then we ought to do\nwhatever would have it as a consequence. But these principles require\nus to think of the good as somehow imperatival (nowadays we would say\n‘deontic’), because otherwise there would be no explanation\nof our ability to extract an ‘ought’ from a\n‘good’ – and nobody thinks of the good as imperatival in\nthat way. Further, it does not follow that if some state of affairs\nwould be good, and I am able to bring it about by acting in some way,\nthen I ought to act in that way. Suppose, for instance, that it would\nbe good if you gave money to a hospital, and that you would do this if\nI wrote you a letter asking you to make some contribution. Does it\nfollow that I ought to write you a letter? Not at all. What follows is\nnot even that my writing you a letter would be good. (Prichard rejects\nthe very notion of the ‘instrumentally good’.) All that we\nget is that my writing you a letter is something that would have a good\nresult, which is just what we had at the beginning. \n\nSo much for Prichard’s views about what makes acts right. He\nfurther held that every act that is right is of a type (specified as\nabove) such that all acts of that type are right. At least, this is how\nhe expressed himself early in his career. Later, he came to realize\nthat this was incautious. We may have one act that is right, and which\nis of such and such a type, and which (as he would have said) is made\nright by being of that type, but where there could be another act of\nthat type which is not right, because it is also of another type which\nis more important, as it were, and which makes the act either not a\nduty, or even plain wrong. So what he came to say was that if an act is\nright, it is of a type such that all acts of that type make a claim on\nthe agent – a claim which may however be defeated by a greater\nclaim made on the agent to avoid acting in that way. Either way round,\nPrichard is not a particularist. Wherever an act is right, according to\nhim, there is a principle at work.  This does not mean, however, that in order to appreciate the\nrightness of the act, one must appeal to the principle.  Prichard’s\nview is quite the contrary. The main thrust of his famous article is\nthe claim that ‘the sense of obligation to do, or of the\nrightness of, an action of a particular kind is absolutely\nunderivative and immediate’ (12). To come to recognize that an\nact is a duty, one need only concentrate on the relevant non-moral\nfacts, facts about the state of affairs that one will, if successful,\noriginate (including any consequences) and facts about the relations\nin which one stands here to others and to oneself (e.g. that one\nborrowed the money and promised to return it by the end of the\nweek). Then, by an act of specifically moral thinking, one recognizes\nthat those facts together make a claim on one to respond in a specific\nway, and that the claim made is stronger than any competing claim\nthrown up by other features of the situation. Again, ‘Suppose we\ncome genuinely to doubt whether we ought, for example, to pay our\ndebts … The only remedy lies in actually getting into a\nsituation which occasions the obligation, or – if our\nimagination be strong enough – in imagining ourselves in that\nsituation, and then letting our capacities of moral thinking do their\nwork’ (20). \n\nBut Prichard also supposes that if we ask why a feature that grounds\nan obligation does so, for example why the fact that I borrowed the\nmoney means that I ought to pay it back, all we can really do is to\noffer a principle, e.g. ‘because I ought to pay anything I\nowe’ (4). If we then go on to ask for a reason for the principle,\nthere is nothing left to be said. But this is not because there is no\nreason for the principle; it is because the principle ‘includes\nits reason, the reason becoming explicit when the principle is properly\nexpressed’ (ibid.). It is when we have lost our sense of the\ntruth of the principle itself, so conceived, that ‘the only\nremedy lies’ in exposing ourselves to a real or imaginary case.\n‘We first recognize the particular obligation and then by\nreflecting on it discover the principle, i.e. formulate to ourselves\nthat general character of the act which renders it, or any act like it,\nan obligation’ (5). \n\nThis process, then, enables one to discern a moral principle, one that\nsays that all acts of a specified type (that is, which are the\norigination of some specified sort of state of affairs), and whose\nagents stand in some specified relation either to others or to\nthemselves, are such that there is a claim on those agents to act in\nthat way, this claim being grounded in the specified nature of the act\nand/or the relevant relation. Knowing this principle might be of some\nuse. But if one comes to doubt the principle, just gazing at it will\nnot restore one’s confidence in it, no matter how searching one’s\ngaze. Nor will it help to try to infer the principle from something\nelse; “the remedy lies not in any process of general\nthinking” (20).  To recover one’s sense of its truth, one needs\nto put oneself into a situation of the relevant sort, or at least to\nimagine oneself in such a situation, if one’s imagination is powerful\nenough, and see whether the sense of obligation arises or not. \n\nIt is characteristic of intuitionists to deny that the right can be\nderived from the good, and Prichard, as we have seen, was no exception.\nSome intuitionists think that the good can be derived from the right,\nperhaps by thinking of the good as that which it is right to approve,\nadmire, seek. Prichard does not take this sort of line either. For him,\ngoodness is very different from rightness. Goodness seems to be a\nsimple monadic property. The things that can have this property are\nstates of affairs, people and actions. An act can be thought of as\ngood, but whenever we do so, we are really thinking of its motive; a\ngood act is one done from a good motive. Prichard distinguished between\nthe moral motive, which is a sense of obligation, and ordinary motives,\nwhich are desires. ‘Desire and a sense of obligation are\nco-ordinate species of motive’ (15). There is the act, the\norigination of a change, and there is the motive for that act. Acts\nthemselves are not good or bad. But we can think of the act together\nwith its motive, and think of such a thing as good or bad.\nPrichard used the term ‘action’ for this combination of act\nand motive (officially, but not always consistently). Acts cannot\nreally be good or bad, but actions can (156–7). \n\nWe might protest that an act can surely be good if it has good\nconsequences: it is ‘instrumentally good’, that is, good as\na means (though not good as an instrument; the term ‘instrumental\nvalue’ is a snare). Prichard’s response to this is that\nbeing a means to a good is not a way of being good.  Obligatoriness is completely different. It looks initially as if\nobligatoriness – being what one ought to do – is another\nmonadic property, distinct from goodness. If it is, the only things\nthat can have this property are acts. The motive with which an act is\ndone is irrelevant to its obligatoriness; one can do what one ought\nfor the wrong reason, or from a bad motive (11–12).  Agents\ncannot have obligatoriness, and nor can outcomes. And to think of an\naction (in Prichard’s official sense) as obligatory is just evidence\nof confusion. If an action is what one ought to do, it is because the\nact involved, the origination, is what one ought to do. Motives\nthemselves cannot be morally right or wrong. Nor can one have an\nobligation to act from a certain motive, for two reasons. First, one\nis not able to choose to have a motive, and one can only have an\nobligation to do something that one is capable of choosing to do or\nnot to do. In general, we either have certain motives or we\ndon’t, and there is not a lot that we can do about it. (We can,\nof course, try to train ourselves up so that we are in a better\nposition next time.) Second, when we choose an action, the motive for\nwhich we will act if we do so act is already given (12). There is not,\nand cannot be, a separate motive for which we will choose the\naction. The motive for choice is the motive for acting. \n\nBut in fact Prichard held, or at least came to hold, that\nobligatoriness is not a property of acts at all. An act that ought to\nbe done is one that is obligatory for some agent, one that that agent\nought to do, or that is his duty. These notions of duty, obligation,\nand ought really denote properties of agents. It is not so much the\naction that is obligatory as the agent that has the obligation to do\nit, or to act in that way.  There is no obligatoriness out there,\nbelonging to the act that we are considering. A sense of obligation is\nnot a recognition of a property that the act has got, in addition to\nall its more normal properties. It is really a sense that one is\nobliged, or ought, to act in that way. One might think of this as a\nrelation, except that there is no act there yet for one to be related\nto in the obligated way. It is not a relation, then.  But if one is\nobliged to act in this way, that will (as I said at the beginning) be\nbecause of – be constituted by – facts about the act and\nabout relations in which one stands to others or to oneself. \n\nWe can now see further reason for rejecting these two\ninferences: \nIf this act would have a good result, I ought to do it. \n\nBoth inferences take us from a remark about an act or action to a\nremark about an agent. Prichard asks us what the principles of these\ninferences could possibly be. \n\nOf course Prichard does not just announce that obligatoriness is not a\nproperty of acts. He has two arguments. The first is that there are\nepistemic difficulties in supposing that acts are made obligatory by\nobjective matters of fact such as their own nature and the attendant\ncircumstances. Most of these things are things that we cannot truly\nknow to be the case, such as what results our action will have (at\nthis point Prichard is appealing to the theory of knowledge that he\ninherited from Cook Wilson). If so, we would hardly ever be able to\nknow what our duty was; and the thought that most of our duties are\nthings of which we cannot know is unbearable. This difficulty vanishes\nif we suppose that the ground for duty is not the objective nature of\nthe situation, but the way the agent supposes things to be. But if we\nmake that move, we suppose that the ground for duty lies in some fact\nabout the agent (that she so supposes), and this makes it much easier\nto think of the duty itself as attaching to the agent rather than to\nthe act. (On this argument and its peculiarities, see Dancy,\n2002.) \n\nPrichard’s second argument is equally idiosyncratic. We can\nhave an obligation to do an action long before the action is done. If\nso, the obligation cannot be a feature of the action, since it exists\nbefore the action does. It must be a feature of something else, if it\nis a feature of anything, and the obvious candidate is the agent. \n\nThis argument impressed Prichard. But Broad wrote ‘I find it\ndifficult to persuade myself that this argument is very\nformidable’ (1950, 555). I don’t myself think that the\nargument is especially formidable, exactly, but it does serve to\nprevent errors of various sorts, such as the error of thinking that\ndeciding what to do is like choosing chocolates from a box, as if the\nactions between which one is choosing are somehow laid out before one\nin their full particularity, waiting to be chosen, that is, done. In\nthe present case, the question is how to avoid the argument without\ngoing down Prichard’s route. It is true that there is no\nparticular action that we are now obliged to do tomorrow; what we are\nobliged to do is only to act in a certain way; there will be a wide\nvariety of actions that would meet that obligation, and we are not\nobliged to do one of them rather than any other. If we have to pay the\nmoney, it doesn’t matter, so far as that goes, how we go about\ndoing it. But how does this help us understand what it is that is\nobligatory – the owner of the obligatoriness, as it were? It cannot\nbelong to ‘acting in a certain way’. The most we could do\nwould be to abandon the idea of obligatoriness as a character belonging\nto ‘acting in a way’ and think instead of something like\n‘it is obligatory that p’, where p stands for ‘A\nVs’. But even that doesn’t quite work, since it seems to\nspecify a state of affairs or perhaps an event as obligatory, and this\nmakes no sense at all. The only way to resolve the impasse is to take\nPrichard’s way out and award the obligation to the agent,\nyielding ‘A is obliged to V’ – which is where\nPrichard wanted to take us. \n\nSo when one senses an obligation one senses a character of oneself,\na claim on oneself to act in a certain way. And to sense an obligation\nall that is needed is to put oneself into the relevant situation and\nconsider the various ways of acting that are available, and the various\nrelevant relations in which one stands to others and to oneself. If\nthis does not lead to a sense of obligation, there is nothing much else\nthat can do it. Moral philosophy, certainly, offers no such resources,\nand the Mistake on which Moral Philosophy rests, to revert to the title\nof Prichard’s famous article, is to suppose otherwise. \n\nDespite all this, in the article in which Prichard addresses these\nissues (1932) he seems at one point to distinguish the obligatory from\nthe right, and to suppose that rightness is still to be understood as\na monadic property of the act, like goodness. If that is the correct\nreading, it introduces considerable complications. See Dancy (2002)\nfor comment. \n\nPrichard works initially with Sidgwick’s contrast between\nintuitionism as the view that conduct is right when conforming to\ncertain principles known to be unconditionally binding, and\nnon-intuitionism as the view that there are ends at which we should\naim. (The view that there are ends that we should do what we can to\nrealize, which is a different view, is according to Prichard not\nSidgwick’s official view, but a better view that Sidgwick should\nhave adopted instead.) \n\nPrichard argues that when one asks oneself what it is to aim at an\noutcome, the answer has to be that it is to act from the desire of it,\nthat is, to be motivated by the prospect of achieving it. But in that\ncase, Sidgwick (as a non-intuitionist) is maintaining that right\nactions are those that have a certain motive. And Prichard has his\nargument (which we have already seen) that we cannot be required to act\nfrom a certain motive, since our motivation is not something over which\nwe have the required control. This form of non-intuitionism, then, is a\nnon-starter, despite the fact that it appears to be Sidgwick’s\npreferred form. \n\nWhat is more, Prichard thinks that even if it were true that we\nought to aim at this end, it would not follow that we ought to do what\n(we think) will lead to it. The derived ‘ought’ here can\nonly be identical with the sort of ‘ought’ that we derive\nin non-moral cases, as when we say to a poisoner ‘you ought to\ngive a second dose’, and such an ‘ought’ has no\nforce for those who have not adopted the relevant end. This is partly\nbecause it is not true that we have a moral duty to do those actions\nthat will lead to outcomes that we have a duty to aim at. We might, for\ninstance, have a duty to help the sick, and it may be that the only way\nto achieve that end is to write begging letters to our more prosperous\nfriends. But it does not follow that we have a duty to write those\nletters. It will be true that we ought to write those letters, but this\nonly means (says Prichard) that if we do not write them, we will not\nachieve our end. The ‘ought’ here is the non-moral\n‘ought’. \n\nWe might think (and Broad did think) that Prichard cannot be right\nto say that there are only two sorts of ‘ought’: the moral\none, full-blown, and the means-end one which only has force for those\nwho have adopted the end, and only says that if they don’t take\nthis means they will not achieve that end. I myself would want to\nappeal to the normative force of advice. But Prichard’s main\npoint might survive such a response. For all that he needs to establish\nis that in order to show that we have a moral duty to write the begging\nletters we need to do more than show that it is the best or only means\nto something which we have a moral duty to aim at. \n\nPrichard thinks, however, that Sidgwick never really considered the\nquestion what it is to aim at an outcome, and that if he had he would\nhave abandoned his official view for a very different view, namely that\nour duty is not to aim at certain outcomes, but to achieve them or\nensure them. \n\nThis new view, however, comes in two forms, which emerge when we ask\nwhat it is about those outcomes that gives us a duty to ensure them.\nThe first answer, which again we can attribute to Sidgwick, is that it\nis the value of those outcomes that grounds the relevant duty. But we\nhave already seen Prichard’s attack on this view. He claims that\nit doesn’t survive the test of instances; nobody thinks that\ntheir sense of obligation, when they feel obliged to do something,\narises from their recognition that in so acting they will be\noriginating something good. And even if they did, it is impossible to\nunderstand how the supposed duty can be derived from some fact about\ngoodness. For duty is imperatival in nature and goodness is not. We\nwould have to find some link between the goodness of the action and the\nduty to act, and all such links are spurious. \n\nThe only remaining alternative is to say that the ground for our\nduty to ensure certain outcomes lies not in their value but in their\nnature. But Prichard claims that this is just a form of intuitionism in\nits conception of our duties – at least in its conception of\nthose duties that are grounded in outcomes (137–42). We are dealing\nwith principles that are unconditionally binding, and which require us\nto achieve certain ends, or ensure certain outcomes. There is nothing\nhere that is inconsistent with intuitionism, or even hard for the\nintuitionist to explain. At this stage non-intuitionism collapses into\nintuitionism. For the act which it is our duty to do is the origination\nof a change, and the act of originating that change is not a duty in\nvirtue of its consequences, or outcomes; it is a duty in its own\nnature. \n\nPrichard’s other main target was Kant. As he sees it, Kant\nmaintained that an action is right if and only if it is done from the\nmotive of duty, that is, from a sense of obligation. Now Prichard wants\nto admit that it can be good to act from this motive; maybe this is the\nonly morally good motive. Other motives, such as a general benevolence,\nmay make the relevant action good, but cannot make it morally good. But\nhe wants first to insist that we cannot have an obligation to act from\na particular motive, as we have already seen. And there are further\ndifficulties peculiar to Kant’s position, in which the motive is\nspecified as the conviction that the act concerned is a duty. The first\nis that the position has the consequence that no act, in\nPrichard’s official narrow sense, is a duty at all. One’s\nduty is to act from the motive of duty, never to do this or that act in\nthe narrow sense. So Prichard is able to present Kant as holding that\nthere is nothing that we ought to do, and therefore that it is\nimpossible to act from the sense that one ought to do this. If so, Kant\nhas undermined his own position, since his understanding of the motive\nof duty shows that there can be no such thing. Or rather, if there is\nsuch a thing as the motive of duty, it follows necessarily that it\ncannot be one’s sole or primary duty to act on it.  This is a lovely chain of criticism, but it seems to me to suffer\nfrom a mistake right at the beginning – which, if it is a\nmistake, is one echoed by Ross (1930, 5), though Ross corrected his\nmistake later (1939, 139). Kant held that an action was only morally\ngood if done from the motive of duty, but he did not hold, as far as I\ncan see, that an act is only right if done from that motive. The\nKantian Categorical Imperative ‘I ought never to act except in\nsuch a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a\nuniversal law’ need not, and surely should not, be read as\nsaying acts are only right if motivated in a certain way. Kant treats\nit as an open question whether an act done ‘in conformity with\nduty’ has also been done ‘from duty’. He would think\nit possible for people to do what they ought, do the right thing, even\nif their actions do not have the special sort of value that so\ninterests him.  Actions have that sort of value when they are done out\nof respect for the law rather than merely in accordance with it. \n\nSo it seems to me that Prichard imposes on Kant a view that he\nneither held nor needed to hold (but see the extended discussion of\nKant (153–9), which ends ‘Plainly he had not fully thought the\nposition out.’). Prichard would have done better to concentrate\non the difference between Kant’s account of how it comes about\nthat an action is a duty and his own minimal account. Kant’s\nexplanation would start from the fact that the maxim of the action can\nbe willed as a universal law. Prichard would, I think, say that there\nis no possibility of, or need for, any such explanation. This is just\none more instance of the quietism that characterizes intuitionism as\nopposed to constructivism. \n\nPrichard’s views remained broadly unchanged throughout his\nlife, except in the following respects. \n\nPrichard originally thought that conscience, or a sense of\nobligation, was a distinct species of motive from desire. ‘A\nsense of obligation does sometimes move us to act’ (15). In this\nhe was a precursor of the direction that intuitionistic moral\nphilosophy would take 60 years later. By 1928, however, he had\nabandoned this dualist view, writing ‘Again, if we face the\npurely general question ‘Can we really do anything whatever\nunless in some respect or other we desire to do it?’ we have to\nanswer “No”’ (38; see also 129). On this new\nunderstanding a sense of obligation was not a motive at all, since it\ninvolved no desire; to get motivation, one needs in addition a desire\nto do the right. This ‘externalist’ position, also adopted\nby Ross, opened the door to complaints that on the intuitionist picture\nmoral cognition was the recognition of facts that lacked any intrinsic\nconnection to action; it should be possible to come to know that it is\nwrong to kill the innocent without thinking of that as at all relevant\nto one’s choice of action. And those complaints eventually became\nthe strongest argument for non-cognitivism in meta-ethics. \n\nAt the beginning of his career Prichard writes ‘In action we\nconsciously originate a change’ (1). On p.10 he speaks apparently\nwithout strain both of our action as being the origination of a change\nand as originating that change, and of ourselves as originating that\nchange. In the Manuscript on Morals (of uncertain date, perhaps c.\n1928), we read that the phrase ‘an action’ is ambiguous,\nbut ‘ordinarily it stands for the origination or bringing\nsomething about … such as the action of poking a fire or\nannoying a neighbour’. \n\nBy 1932 he has moved on, but only a little. ‘It is, no doubt,\nnot easy to say what we mean by ‘an action’ or by\n‘doing something’. Yet we have in the end to allow that we\nmean by it originating, causing, or bringing about the existence of\nsomething, viz. some new state of an existing thing or substance, or,\nmore shortly, causing a change of state of some existing thing.\n… We may be tempted to go farther, and say that we mean by\n‘an action’ the conscious origination of something, i.e.\nthe originating something knowing that we are doing so. But this will\nnot do; for no one, for instance, thinks himself to be denying that he\nhas hurt a person’s feelings when he says that he did not know that\nhe was hurting them, and, indeed, thought he was not’ (85). \n\nBut at this point Prichard introduces a distinction between what we\ncause directly and what we cause indirectly. He says that when we cause\nsomething indirectly, by causing something else to cause it, ‘the\nresult is not wholly due to us’. When we cause something\ndirectly, by contrast, it is wholly due to us. And Prichard gives us an\nexample of such a thing, namely ‘transferring certain ink to\ncertain places on a piece of paper’. But he maintains that if\nsuch a thing were an obligation, it would be the sort of obligation we\nwould never be able to know that we have, because we can never know\nwhat will in fact result. If we are to be capable of knowing our\nobligations, they cannot be obligations which we cannot know that we\nhave met when we have met them. If so, our obligations cannot be to\nachieve this or that outcome, but only to ‘set ourselves to\nachieve them’. All actions that are obligatory are of this sort.\nAnd Prichard evidently concludes that when we cause a change directly,\nin each case there is such a thing as ‘setting oneself to cause\nthat change’, which may be successful and may not be. An action\nthat is a failure is still an action. So though we may describe an\naction in terms of its further effects, say lighting the fire, a\nnecessary part of that action will have been a ‘setting oneself\nto …’. \n\nAt the end of his life, in 1945, he writes that the view he has\ninherited from Cook Wilson, namely that to act is to originate a\nchange, has to be wrong. In fact, to act is to will a change, and the\nchange willed is not an action; most often it is a bodily movement,\nthat is to say, a change in the location of one’s body or of\nparts of it. He says that the characterization of willing as\n‘setting oneself to cause a change’ has to be wrong.\n“I now think I was mistaken in suggesting that the phrase in use\nfor it is ‘setting oneself to cause’” (274). \n\nThe reason he gives for abandoning the Cook Wilson picture is that\nan action is an activity, and there is no such activity as that of\noriginating or causing a change in oneself or anything else (273). Even\nif causing a change may require an activity, it is not that activity.\nNow often we do not know what activity is involved when one body causes\na change in another. But when it comes to human actions, we do know.\nFirst, we know that we are looking for something mental, and second, we\nknow that the word for that special kind of mental activity is\n‘willing’. \n\nVery little can be said about this mental activity of willing,\nthough we are all, of course, perfectly familiar with it. But we can\nask about its proper object. What is it that we will? Two possible\nanswers present themselves: we will actions, and we will changes. The\nfirst of these must be wrong because it generates an infinite regress.\nSo the second must be right. An action is the willing of a change. \n\nPrichard’s earliest work does seem to treat rightness or\nobligatoriness as a property of the action to be done, or rather, as a\nproperty of the action once it is done. By 1932, however, as discussed\nin section 3 above, he had moved to the view that obligation is a\nproperty of the agent, not of the act at all. There is some sign in his\npublished paper of that date that he had not yet extended the new view\nto include rightness, i.e. that he had come to distinguish rightness,\nwhich remained a property of the act and not of the agent, from\nobligation or obligatedness, now appearing as a property of the agent.\nFor he writes ‘While the truth could not be expressed by saying\n‘My setting myself to do so-and-so would be\nright, because I think it would have a certain effect’\n– a statement which would be as vicious in principle as the\nstatement ‘Doing so-and-so would be right\nbecause I think it would be right’ – there is nothing to\nprevent its being expressible in the form ‘I ought to\nset myself to do so-and-so because I think it would have a certain\neffect’ (99–100). With this distinction the property of\nobligatoriness vanishes altogether, though rightness remains, grounded\nin the familiar combinations of the (objective) nature of the situation\nand some definite relation in which the agent stands to others or to\nhimself. However, if this was Prichard’s view at the time, no\ntrace of it appears later, and Ross appears not to have noticed it at\nall (see his account of the argument of Prichard’s 1932 paper in\nRoss 1939, ch. 7). And this is just as well, because it is very\nunsettling to be told that one can have an obligation to do an action\nthat is in fact wrong. \n\nIn his earliest work Prichard supposes that principles specify\ndistinct obligations, e.g. those of telling the truth, educating\none’s children, serving one’s country. It did not take him\nlong to see that, so understood, pretty well any collection of\nprinciples is going to lead to contradiction and incoherence. He then\nmoved to what looks like a form of what we now know best as\nRoss’s theory of prima facie duties. On this understanding, a\nprinciple specifies what Prichard calls a ‘claim’ on us,\nfor example that we serve our country – but all such claims can\nbe defeated by more pressing claims to do something else, such as care\nfor our aging mother. Prichard’s version seems to differ from\nRoss’s, however, at least if we are to trust a letter he wrote to\nRoss in 1932 (to be found in MacAdam, 286–7). Ross thinks that duty\nproper, as he calls it, is a quite different sort of thing from a prima\nfacie duty; the notion of ‘duty’ in ‘prima facie\nduty’ is a different notion from that in ‘duty proper’.\nPrichard, by contrast, thinks of this as incoherent, and opts instead\nfor the view that, expressed in terms of ‘ought’, maintains\nthat, faced with a moral difficulty, there will be different actions\neach of which in some respect I ought to do (this is the prima facie\nought) and of those one will be the action which I most ought to do, my\nduty proper. On this picture there is no great divide between the\n‘ought’ of duty proper and the ‘ought’ of prima\nfacie duty.","contact.mail":"jdancy@austin.utexas.edu","contact.domain":"austin.utexas.edu"}]
