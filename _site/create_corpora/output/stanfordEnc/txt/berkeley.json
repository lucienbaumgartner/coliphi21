He was a brilliant critic of his\npredecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke. He was a\ntalented metaphysician famous for defending idealism, that is, the\nview that reality consists exclusively of minds and their\nideas. Berkeley's system, while it strikes many as counter-intuitive,\nis strong and flexible enough to counter most objections. His\nmost-studied works, the Treatise Concerning the Principles of\nHuman Knowledge (Principles, for short) and Three\nDialogues between Hylas and Philonous (Dialogues), are\nbeautifully written and dense with the sort of arguments that delight\ncontemporary philosophers. He was also a wide-ranging thinker with\ninterests in religion (which were fundamental to his philosophical\nmotivations), the psychology of vision, mathematics, physics, morals,\neconomics, and medicine.  Although many of Berkeley's first readers\ngreeted him with incomprehension, he influenced both Hume and Kant,\nand is much read (if little followed) in our own day.\n\n\n Berkeley was born in 1685 near Kilkenny, Ireland. After several\nyears of schooling at Kilkenny College, he entered Trinity College, in\nDublin, at age 15. He was made a fellow of Trinity College in\n1707 (three years after graduating) and was ordained in the Anglican\nChurch shortly thereafter. At Trinity, where the curriculum was\nnotably modern, Berkeley encountered the new science and philosophy of\nthe late seventeenth century, which was characterized by hostility\ntowards Aristotelianism. Berkeley's philosophical notebooks\n(sometimes styled the Philosophical Commentaries), which he\nbegan in 1707, provide rich documentation of Berkeley's early\nphilosophical evolution, enabling the reader to track the emergence of\nhis immaterialist philosophy from a critical response to Descartes,\nLocke, Malebranche, Newton, Hobbes, and others. \n Berkeley's first important published work, An Essay Towards a New\nTheory of Vision (1709), was an influential contribution to the\npsychology of vision and also developed doctrines relevant to his\nidealist project. In his mid-twenties, he published his most enduring\nworks, the Treatise concerning the Principles of Human\nKnowledge (1710) and the Three Dialogues between Hylas and\nPhilonous (1713), whose central doctrines we will examine\nbelow. \n In 1720, while completing a four-year tour of Europe as tutor to a\nyoung man, Berkeley composed De Motu, a tract on the\nphilosophical foundations of mechanics which developed his views on\nphilosophy of science and articulated an instrumentalist approach to\nNewtonian dynamics. After his continental tour, Berkeley returned to\nIreland and resumed his position at Trinity until 1724, when he was\nappointed Dean of Derry. At this time, Berkeley began developing his\nscheme for founding a college in Bermuda. He was convinced that Europe\nwas in spiritual decay and that the New World offered hope\nfor a new golden age. Having secured a charter and promises of funding\nfrom the British Parliament, Berkeley set sail for America in 1728,\nwith his new bride, Anne Forster. They spent three years in Newport,\nRhode Island, awaiting the promised money, but Berkeley's political\nsupport had collapsed and they were forced to abandon the project and\nreturn to Britain in 1731. While in America, Berkeley composed\nAlciphron,  a work of Christian apologetics directed\nagainst the “free-thinkers” whom he took to be enemies of established\nAnglicanism. Alciphron is also a significant philosophical\nwork and a crucial source of Berkeley's views on language. \n Shortly after returning to London, Berkeley composed the Theory\nof Vision, Vindicated and Explained, a defense of his earlier\nwork on vision, and the Analyst, an acute and influential\ncritique of the foundations of Newton's calculus. In 1734 he was made\nBishop of Cloyne, and thus he returned to Ireland. It was here that\nBerkeley wrote his last, strangest, and best-selling (in his own\nlifetime) philosophical work. Siris (1744) has a three-fold\naim:  to establish the virtues of tar-water (a liquid prepared by\nletting pine tar stand in water) as a medical panacea, to provide\nscientific background supporting the efficacy of tar-water, and to\nlead the mind of the reader, via gradual steps, toward contemplation\nof God. Berkeley died in 1753, shortly after moving to Oxford to\nsupervise the education of his son George, one of the three out of\nseven of his children to survive childhood. \n In his two great works of metaphysics, Berkeley defends idealism by\nattacking the materialist alternative. What exactly is the doctrine\nthat he's attacking? Readers should first note that\n“materialism” is here used to mean “the doctrine\nthat material things exist”. This is in contrast with another\nuse, more standard in contemporary discussions, according to which\nmaterialism is the doctrine that only material things\nexist. Berkeley contends that no material things exist, not\njust that some immaterial things exist. Thus, he attacks Cartesian and\nLockean dualism, not just the considerably less popular (in\nBerkeley's time) view, held by Hobbes, that only material things\nexist. But what exactly is a material thing?  Interestingly, part\nof Berkeley's attack on matter is to argue that this question cannot\nbe satisfactorily answered by the materialists, that they cannot\ncharacterize their supposed material things.  However, an answer\nthat captures what exactly it is that Berkeley rejects is that\nmaterial things are mind-independent things or\nsubstances. And a mind-independent thing is something whose existence\nis not dependent on thinking/perceiving things, and thus would exist\nwhether or not any thinking things (minds) existed. Berkeley holds\nthat there are no such mind-independent things, that, in the famous\nphrase, esse est percipi (aut percipere) — to be is to\nbe perceived (or to perceive). \n Berkeley charges that materialism promotes skepticism and atheism:\nskepticism because materialism implies that our senses mislead us as\nto the natures of these material things, which moreover need not exist\nat all, and atheism because a material world could be expected to run\nwithout the assistance of God. This double charge provides Berkeley's\nmotivation for questioning materialism (one which he thinks\nshould motivate others as well), though not, of course, a\nphilosophical argument against materialism. Fortunately, the\nPrinciples and Dialogues overflow with such\narguments. Below, we will examine some of the main elements of\nBerkeley's argumentative campaign against matter.                        \n The starting point of Berkeley's attack on the materialism of his\ncontemporaries is a very short argument presented in\nPrinciples 4: \n Berkeley presents here the following argument (see Winkler 1989,\n138): \n (2) We perceive only ideas. \n Therefore, \n (3) Ordinary objects are ideas. \n The argument is valid, and premise (1) looks hard to deny.  What\nabout premise (2)?  Berkeley believes that this premise is accepted by\nall the modern philosophers. In the Principles, Berkeley is\noperating within the idea-theoretic tradition of the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In particular, Berkeley believes\nthat some version of this premise is accepted by his main targets, the\ninfluential philosophers Descartes and Locke. \n However, Berkeley recognizes that these philosophers have an obvious\nresponse available to this argument. This response blocks Berkeley's\ninference to (3) by distinguishing two sorts of perception, mediate\nand immediate. Thus, premises (1) and (2) are replaced by the claims\nthat (1′) we mediately perceive ordinary objects, while\n(2′) we immediately perceive only ideas.  From these claims, of\ncourse, no idealist conclusion follows. The response reflects a\nrepresentationalist theory of perception, according to which\nwe indirectly (mediately) perceive material things, by directly\n(immediately) perceiving ideas, which are mind-dependent items. The\nideas represent external material objects, and thereby allow\nus to perceive them. \n Whether Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke were representationalists\nof this kind is a matter of some controversy (see e.g. Yolton 1984,\nChappell 1994). However, Berkeley surely had good grounds for\nunderstanding his predecessors in this way: it reflects the most\nobvious interpretation of Locke's account of perception and\nDescartes' whole procedure in the Meditations tends to\nsuggest this sort of view, given the meditator's situation as someone\ncontemplating her own ideas, trying to determine whether something\nexternal corresponds to them. \n Berkeley devotes the succeeding sections of the Principles\nto undermining the representationalist response to his initial\nargument. In effect, he poses the question: What allows an idea to\nrepresent a material object?  He assumes, again with good grounds,\nthat the representationalist answer is going to involve\nresemblance:  \n Berkeley argues that this supposed resemblance is nonsensical; an\nidea can only be like another idea.  \n But why?  The closest Berkeley ever comes to directly addressing this\nquestion is in his early philosophical notebooks, where he observes\nthat “Two things cannot be said to be alike or unlike till they\nhave been compar'd” (PC 377). Thus, because the mind can compare\nnothing but its own ideas, which by hypothesis are the only things\nimmediately perceivable, the representationalist cannot assert a\nlikeness between an idea and a non-ideal mind-independent material\nobject. (For further discussion, see Winkler 1989, 145–9.) \n If Berkeley's Likeness Principle, the thesis that an idea can only be\nlike another idea, is granted, representationalist materialism is in\nserious trouble. For how are material objects now to be characterized?\nIf material objects are supposed to be extended, solid, or colored,\nBerkeley will counter that these sensory qualities pertain to ideas,\nto that which is immediately perceived, and that the materialist\ncannot assert that material objects are like ideas in these ways. Many\npassages in the Principles and Dialogues drive home\nthis point, arguing that matter is, if not an incoherent notion, at\nbest a completely empty one. \n One way in which Berkeley's anti-abstractionism comes into play is in\nreinforcing this point. Berkeley argues in the\n“Introduction” to the\n Principles[1]\n that we cannot form general ideas in the way that Locke often seems\nto suggest—by stripping particularizing qualities from an idea\nof a particular, creating a new, intrinsically general,\nabstract\n idea.[2]\n Berkeley then claims that notions the materialist might invoke in a\nlast-ditch attempt to characterize matter, e.g. being or mere\nextension, are objectionably abstract and\n unavailable.[3] \n Berkeley is aware that the materialist has one important card left to\nplay: Don't we need material objects in order to explain our\nideas?  And indeed, this seems intuitively gripping: Surely the best\nexplanation of the fact that I have a chair idea every time I enter my\noffice and that my colleague has a chair idea when she enters\nmy office is that a single enduring material object causes\nall these various ideas. Again, however, Berkeley replies by\neffectively exploiting the weaknesses of his opponents' theories: \n Firstly, Berkeley contends, a representationalist must admit that we\ncould have our ideas without there being any external objects\ncausing them (PHK 18). (This is one way in which Berkeley sees\nmaterialism as leading to skepticism.)  More devastatingly, however,\nhe must admit that the existence of matter does not help to explain\nthe occurrence of our ideas. After all, Locke himself diagnosed the\ndifficulty: \n And, when Descartes was pressed by Elizabeth as to how mind\nand body\n interact,[4]\n she rightly regarded his answers as unsatisfactory. The basic problem\nhere is set by dualism: how can one substance causally affect another\nsubstance of a fundamentally different kind?  In its\nCartesian form, the difficulty is particularly severe: how can an\nextended thing, which affects other extended things only by mechanical\nimpact, affect a mind, which is non-extended and\nnon-spatial? \n Berkeley's point is thus well taken. It is worth noting that, in\naddition to undermining the materialist's attempted inference to the\nbest explanation, Berkeley's point also challenges any attempt to\nexplain representation and mediate perception in terms of\ncausation. That is, the materialist might try to claim that ideas\nrepresent material objects, not by resemblance, but in virtue of being\ncaused by the objects. (Though neither Descartes nor Locke\nspells out such an account, there are grounds in each for attributing\nsuch an account to them. For Descartes see Wilson 1999, 73–76; for\nLocke see Chappell 1994, 53.)  However, PHK 19 implies that the\nmaterialists are not in a position to render this account of\nrepresentation philosophically satisfactory. \n As emphasized above, Berkeley's campaign against matter, as he\npresents it in the Principles, is directed against\nmaterialist representationalism and presupposes\nrepresentationalism. In particular, Berkeley presupposes that all\nanyone ever directly or immediately perceives are ideas. As\ncontemporary philosophers, we might wonder whether Berkeley has\nanything to say to a materialist who denies this representationalist\npremise and asserts instead that we ordinarily directly/immediately\nperceive material objects themselves. The answer is\n‘yes’. \n However, one place where one might naturally look for such an\nargument is not, in fact, as promising as might initially appear. In\nboth the Principles (22–3) and the Dialogues (200),\nBerkeley gives a version of what has come to be called “The\nMaster\n Argument”[5]\n because of the apparent strength with which he endorses it: \n The argument seems intended to establish that we cannot actually\nconceive of mind-independent objects, that is, objects existing\nunperceived and unthought of. Why not?  Simply because in order to\nconceive of any such things, we must ourselves be conceiving,\ni.e., thinking, of them. However, as Pitcher (1977, 113) nicely observes,\nsuch an argument seems to conflate the representation (what\nwe conceive with) and the represented (what we\nconceive of—the content of our thought). Once we make\nthis distinction, we realize that although we must have some\nconception or representation in order to conceive of something, and\nthat representation is in some sense thought of, it does not\nfollow (contra Berkeley) that what we conceive of must be a\nthought-of object. That is, when we imagine a tree standing alone in a\nforest, we (arguably) conceive of an unthought-of object, though of\ncourse we must employ a thought in order to accomplish this\n feat.[6]\n  Thus (as many commentators have observed), this argument\nfails. \n A more charitable reading of the argument (see Winkler 1989, 184–7;\nLennon 1988) makes Berkeley's point that we cannot represent\nunconceivedness, because we have never and could never experience\n it.[7]\n  Because we cannot represent unconceivedness, we cannot conceive of\nmind-independent objects. While this is a rather more promising\nargument, it clearly presupposes representationalism, just as\nBerkeley's earlier Principles arguments\n did.[8] \n (This, however, is not necessarily a defect of the interpretation,\nsince the Principles, as we saw above, is aimed against\nrepresentationalism, and in the Dialogues the Master Argument\ncrops up only after Hylas has been converted to representationalism\n(see\n below).)[9] \n Thus, if we seek a challenge to direct realist materialism, we must\nturn to the Three Dialogues, where the character Hylas (the\nwould-be materialist) begins from a sort of naïve realism,\naccording to which we perceive material objects themselves,\ndirectly. Against this position, Philonous (lover of\nspirit—Berkeley's spokesperson) attempts to argue that the\nsensible qualities—the qualities immediately perceived by\nsense—must be ideal, rather than belonging to material\nobjects. (The following analysis of these first dialogue arguments is\nindebted to Margaret Wilson's account in “Berkeley on the\nMind-Dependence of Colors,” Wilson 1999,\n 229–242.[10]) \n Philonous begins his first argument by contending that sensible\nqualities such as heat are not distinct from pleasure or pain.\nPleasure and pain, Philonous argues, are allowed by all to be merely\nin the mind; therefore the same must be true for the sensible\nqualities. The most serious difficulties with this argument are (1)\nwhether we should grant the “no distinction” premise in\nthe case of the particular sensory qualities invoked by Berkeley (why\nnot suppose that I can distinguish between the heat and the pain?)\nand (2) if we do, whether we should generalize to all sensory\nqualities as Berkeley would have us do. \n Secondly, Philonous invokes relativity arguments to suggest that\nbecause sensory qualities are relative to the perceiver, e.g. what is\nhot to one hand may be cold to the other and what is sweet to one\nperson may be bitter to another, they cannot belong to\nmind-independent material objects, for such objects could not bear\ncontradictory qualities. \n  As Berkeley is well aware, one may reply to this sort of argument by\nclaiming that only one of the incompatible qualities is truly a\nquality of the object and that the other apparent qualities result\nfrom misperception. But how then, Berkeley asks, are these\n“true” qualities to be identified and distinguished from\nthe “false” ones (3D 184)?  By noting the differences\nbetween animal perception and human perception, Berkeley suggests that\nit would be arbitrary anthropocentrism to claim that humans have\nspecial access to the true qualities of objects.  Further, Berkeley\nuses the example of microscopes to undermine the prima facie\nplausible thought that the true visual qualities of objects are\nrevealed by close examination. Thus, Berkeley provides a strong\nchallenge to any direct realist attempt to specify standard conditions\nunder which the true (mind-independent) qualities of objects are\n(directly) perceived by sense. \n Under this pressure from Philonous, Hylas retreats (perhaps a bit\nquickly) from naïve realism to a more “philosophical”\nposition. He first tries to make use of the primary/secondary quality\ndistinction associated with mechanism and, again, locatable in the\nthought of Descartes and Locke. Thus, Hylas allows that color, taste,\netc. may be mind-dependent (secondary) qualities, but contends that\nfigure, solidity, motion and rest (the primary qualities) exist in\nmind-independent material bodies. The mechanist picture behind this\nproposal is that bodies are composed of particles with size, shape,\nmotion/rest, and perhaps solidity, and that our sensory ideas arise\nfrom the action of such particles on our sense organs and, ultimately,\non our minds. Berkeley opposes this sort of mechanism throughout his\nwritings, believing that it engenders skepticism by dictating that\nbodies are utterly unlike our sensory experience of them. Here\nPhilonous has a two-pronged reply: (1) The same sorts of relativity\narguments that were made against secondary qualities can be made\nagainst primary ones. (2) We cannot abstract the primary qualities\n(e.g. shape) from secondary ones (e.g.  color), and thus we cannot\nconceive of mechanist material bodies which are extended but not (in\nthemselves)\n colored.[11] \n When, after some further struggles, Hylas finally capitulates to\nPhilonous' view that all of existence is mind-dependent, he does so\nunhappily and with great reluctance. Philonous needs to convince him\n(as Berkeley needed to convince his readers in both books) that a\ncommonsensical philosophy could be built on an immaterialist\nfoundation, that no one but a skeptic or atheist would ever miss\nmatter. As a matter of historical fact, Berkeley persuaded few of his\ncontemporaries, who for the most part regarded him as a purveyor of\nskeptical paradoxes (Bracken 1965). Nevertheless, we can and should\nappreciate the way in which Berkeley articulated a positive idealist\nphilosophical system, which, if not in perfect accord with common\nsense, is in many respects superior to its competitors. \n The basics of Berkeley's metaphysics are apparent from the first\nsection of the main body of the Principles: \n As this passage illustrates, Berkeley does not deny the existence of\nordinary objects such as stones, trees, books, and apples. On the\ncontrary, as was indicated above, he holds that only an immaterialist\naccount of such objects can avoid skepticism about their existence and\nnature. What such objects turn out to be, on his account, are bundles\nor collections of ideas. An apple is a combination of visual ideas\n(including the sensible qualities of color and visual shape), tangible\nideas, ideas of taste, smell,\n etc.[12] \n The question of what does the combining is a philosophically\ninteresting one which Berkeley does not address in detail. He does\nmake clear that there are two sides to the process of bundling ideas\ninto objects: (1) co-occurrence, an objective fact about what sorts of\nideas tend to accompany each other in our experience, and (2) something we\ndo when we decide to single out a set of co-occurring ideas and refer\nto it with a certain name (NTV 109). \n Thus, although there is no material world for Berkeley, there is a\nphysical world, a world of ordinary objects. This world is\nmind-dependent, for it is composed of ideas, whose existence consists\nin being perceived. For ideas, and so for the physical world, esse\nest percipi.  \n Berkeley's ontology is not exhausted by the ideal, however. In\naddition to perceived things (ideas), he posits perceivers, i.e., minds\nor spirits, as he often terms them. Spirits, he emphasizes,\nare totally different in kind from ideas, for they are active where\nideas are passive. This suggests that Berkeley has replaced one kind\nof dualism, of mind and matter, with another kind of dualism, of mind\nand idea. There is something to this point, given Berkeley's refusal\nto elaborate upon the relation between active minds and passive\nideas. At Principles 49, he famously dismisses quibbling about\nhow ideas inhere in the mind (are minds colored and extended\nwhen such sensible qualities “exist in” them?) with the\ndeclaration that “those qualities are in the mind only as they\nare perceived by it, that is, not by way of mode or\nattribute, but only by way of idea”. Berkeley's\ndualism, however, is a dualism within the realm of the\nmind-dependent. \n The last major item in Berkeley's ontology is God, himself a spirit,\nbut an infinite one. Berkeley believes that once he has established\nidealism, he has a novel and convincing argument for God's existence\nas the cause of our sensory ideas. He argues by elimination: What\ncould cause my sensory ideas?  Candidate causes, supposing that\nBerkeley has already established that matter doesn't exist, are (1)\nother ideas, (2) myself, or (3) some other spirit. Berkeley eliminates\nthe first option with the following argument (PHK 25): \n (2) But because of the mind-dependent status of ideas, they cannot\nhave any characteristics which they are not perceived to have. \n Therefore, \n (3) Ideas are passive, that is, they possess no causal\npower. \n It should be noted that premise (2) is rather strong; Phillip Cummins\n(1990) identifies it as Berkeley's “manifest qualities\nthesis” and argues that it commits Berkeley to the view that\nideas are radically and completely dependent on perceivers in the way\nthat sensations of pleasure and pain are typically taken to\n be.[13] \n The second option is eliminated with the observation that although I\nclearly can cause some ideas at will (e.g. ideas of imagination),\nsensory ideas are involuntary; they present themselves whether I wish\nto perceive them or not and I cannot control their content. The hidden\nassumption here is that any causing the mind does must be done by\nwilling and such willing must be accessible to consciousness.\nBerkeley is hardly alone in presupposing this model of the mental;\nDescartes, for example, makes a similar set of assumptions.  \n This leaves us, then, with the third option: my sensory ideas must be\ncaused by some other spirit. Berkeley thinks that when we consider the\nstunning complexity and systematicity of our sensory ideas, we must\nconclude that the spirit in question is wise and benevolent beyond\nmeasure, that, in short, he is God. \n With the basic ingredients of Berkeley's ontology in place, we can\nbegin to consider how his system works by seeing how he responds to a\nnumber of intuitively compelling objections to it. Berkeley himself\nsees very well how necessary this is: Much of the Principles\nis structured as a series of objections and replies, and in the\nThree Dialogues, once Philonous has rendered Hylas a\nreluctant convert to idealism, he devotes the rest of the book to\nconvincing him that this is a philosophy which coheres well with\ncommon sense, at least better than materialism ever did. \n Perhaps the most obvious objection to idealism is that it makes real\nthings no different from imaginary ones—both seem fleeting\nfigments of our own minds, rather than the solid objects of the\nmaterialists. Berkeley replies that the distinction between real\nthings and chimeras retains its full force on his view. One way of\nmaking the distinction is suggested by his argument for the existence\nof God, examined above: Ideas which depend on our own finite human\nwills are not (constituents of) real things. Not being voluntary is\nthus a necessary condition for being a real thing, but it is clearly\nnot sufficient, since hallucinations and dreams do not depend on our\nwills, but are nevertheless not real. Berkeley notes that the ideas\nthat constitute real things exhibit a steadiness, vivacity, and\ndistinctness that chimerical ideas do not. The most crucial feature\nthat he points to, however, is order.  The ideas imprinted by\nthe author of nature as part of rerum natura occur in regular\npatterns, according to the laws of nature (“the set rules or\nestablished methods, wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the\nideas of sense, are called the Laws of Nature” PHK 30). They are\nthus regular and coherent, that is, they constitute a coherent real\nworld. \n The related notions of regularity and of the laws of nature are\ncentral to the workability of Berkeley's idealism. They allow him to\nrespond to the following objection, put forward in PHK 60: \n Berkeley's answer, for which he is indebted to\n Malebranche,[14]\n is that, although God could make a watch run (that is, produce in us\nideas of a watch running) without the watch having any internal\nmechanism (that is, without it being the case that, were we to open\nthe watch, we would have ideas of an internal mechanism), he cannot do\nso if he is to act in accordance with the laws of nature, which he has\nestablished for our benefit, to make the world regular and\npredictable. Thus, whenever we have ideas of a working watch, we will\nfind that if we open\n it,[15]\n we will see (have ideas of) an appropriate internal\nmechanism. Likewise, when we have ideas of a living tulip, we will\nfind that if we pull it apart, we will observe the usual internal\nstructure of such plants, with the same transport tissues,\nreproductive parts, etc. \n Implicit in the answer above is Berkeley's insightful account of\nscientific explanation and the aims of science. A bit of background is\nneeded here to see why this issue posed a special challenge for\nBerkeley. One traditional understanding of science, derived from\nAristotle, held that it aims at identifying the causes of\nthings. Modern natural philosophers such as Descartes narrowed\nscience's domain to efficient causes and thus held that\nscience should reveal the efficient causes of natural things,\nprocesses, and\n events.[16] \n Berkeley considers this as the source of an objection at Principles\n51: \n On Berkeley's account, the true cause of any phenomenon is a\nspirit, and most often it is the same spirit, namely, God.  \n But surely, one might object, it is a step backwards to abandon our\nscientific theories and simply note that God causes what happens in\nthe physical world!  Berkeley's first response here, that we should\nthink with the learned but speak with the vulgar, advises us to\ncontinue to say that fire heats, that the heart pumps blood, etc.\nWhat makes this advice legitimate is that he can reconstrue such talk\nas being about regularities in our ideas. In Berkeley's view, the\npoint of scientific inquiry is to reveal such regularities: \n Natural philosophers thus consider signs, rather than causes (PHK\n108), but their results are just as useful as they would be under a\nmaterialist system. Moreover, the regularities they discover provide\nthe sort of explanation proper to science, by rendering the particular\nevents they subsume unsurprising (PHK 104). The sort of explanation\nproper to science, then, is not causal explanation, but reduction to\n regularity.[17] \n Regularity provides a foundation for one of Berkeley's responses\nto the objection summarized in the famous limerick: \n The worry, of course, is that if to be is to be perceived (for\nnon-spirits), then there are no trees in the Quad at 3 a.m. when no\none is there to perceive them and there is no furniture in my office\nwhen I leave and close the door. Interestingly, in the\nPrinciples Berkeley seems relatively unperturbed by this\nnatural objection to idealism. He claims that there is no problem\nfor \n So, when I say that my desk still exists after I leave my office,\nperhaps I just mean that I would perceive it if I were in my office,\nor, more broadly, that a finite mind would perceive the desk were it\nin the appropriate circumstances (in my office, with the lights on,\nwith eyes open, etc.). This is to provide a sort of counterfactual\nanalysis of the continued existence of unperceived objects. The truth\nof the counterfactuals in question is anchored in regularity: because\nGod follows set patterns in the way he causes ideas, I would have a\ndesk idea if I were in the office. \n Unfortunately, this analysis has counterintuitive consequences when\ncoupled with the esse est percipi doctrine (McCracken 1979,\n286). If to be is, as Berkeley insists, to be perceived, then the\nunperceived desk does not exist, despite the fact that it\nwould be perceived and thus would exist if someone\nopened the office door. Consequently, on this view the desk would not\nendure uninterrupted but would pop in and out of existence, though it\nwould do so quite predictably. One way to respond to this worry would\nbe to dismiss it—what does it matter if the desk ceases to exist\nwhen unperceived, as long as it exists whenever we need it?  Berkeley\nshows signs of this sort of attitude in Principles 45–46, where he\ntries to argue that his materialist opponents and scholastic\npredecessors are in much the same\n boat.[19] \n This “who cares?” response to the problem of continued\nexistence is fair enough as far as it goes, but it surely does\nconflict with common sense, so if Berkeley were to take this route he\nwould have to moderate his claims about his system's ability to\naccommodate everything desired by the person on the street. \n Another strategy, however, is suggested by Berkeley's reference in\nPHK 3 and 48 to “some other spirit,” a strategy\nsummarized in a further limerick: \n If the other spirit in question is God, an omnipresent being, then\nperhaps his perception can be used to guarantee a completely\ncontinuous existence to every physical object. In the Three\nDialogues, Berkeley very clearly invokes God in this\ncontext. Interestingly, whereas in the Principles, as we have\nseen above, he argued that God must exist in order to cause\nour ideas of sense, in the Dialogues (212, 214–5) he argues\nthat our ideas must exist in God when not perceived by\n us.[20]\n  If our ideas exist in God, then they presumably exist\ncontinuously. Indeed, they must exist continuously, since standard\nChristian doctrine dictates that God is unchanging.  \n Although this solves one problem for Berkeley, it creates several\nmore. The first is that Berkeley's other commitments, religious and\nphilosophical, dictate that God cannot literally have our ideas. Our\nideas are sensory ideas and God is a being who “can suffer\nnothing, nor be affected with any painful sensation, or indeed any\nsensation at all” (3D 206). Nor can our sensory ideas be copies\nof God's nonsensory ones (McCracken 1979): \n A second problem is that God's ideas are eternal, whereas physical\nobjects typically have finite duration. And, even worse, God has ideas\nof all possible objects (Pitcher 1977, 171–2), not just the ones which\nwe would commonsensically wish to say exist. \n  A solution (proposed by McCracken) to these related problems is to\ntie the continued existence of ordinary objects to God's will, rather\nthan to his understanding. McCracken's suggestion is that unperceived\nobjects continue to exist as God's decrees. Such an account in terms\nof divine decrees or volitions looks promising: The tree continues to\nexist when unperceived just in case God has an appropriate volition or\nintention to cause a tree-idea in finite perceivers under the right\ncircumstances.  Furthermore, this solution has important textual\nsupport: In the Three Dialogues, Hylas challenges Philonous\nto account for the creation, given that all existence is\nmind-dependent, in his view, but everything must exist eternally in\nthe mind of God. Philonous responds as follows: \n Here Berkeley ties the actual existence of created physical beings to\nGod's decrees, that is, to his will. \n  As with the counterfactual analysis of continued existence, however,\nthis account also fails under pressure from the esse est\npercipi principle: \n Philonous.  And what is perceivable but an idea? And can an\nidea exist without being actually perceived?  These are points\nlong since agreed between us. (3D 234)\n  \n Thus, if the only grounds of continued existence are\nvolitions in God's mind, rather than perceived items (ideas),\nthen ordinary objects do not exist continuously, but rather pop in and\nout of existence in a lawful fashion. \n Fortunately, Kenneth Winkler has put forward an interpretation which\ngoes a great distance towards resolving this difficulty. In effect, he\nproposes that we amend the “volitional” interpretation of\nthe existence of objects with the hypothesis that Berkeley held\n“the denial of blind agency” (Winkler 1989, 207–224). This\nprinciple, which can be found in many authors of the period (including\nLocke), dictates that any volition must have an idea behind it, that\nis, must have a cognitive component that gives content to the\nvolition, which would otherwise be empty or “blind”. While\nthe principle is never explicitly invoked or argued for by Berkeley,\nin a number of passages he does note the interdependence of will and\nunderstanding. Winkler plausibly suggests that Berkeley may have found\nthis principle so obvious as to need no arguing. With it in place, we\nhave a guarantee that anything willed by God, e.g. that finite\nperceivers in appropriate circumstances should have elm tree ideas,\nalso has a divine idea associated with it. Furthermore, we have a neat\nexplanation of Berkeley's above-noted leap in the Dialogues\nfrom the claim that God must cause our ideas to the claim that our\nideas must exist in God.  \n Of course, it remains true that God cannot have ideas that are,\nstrictly speaking, the same as ours. This problem is closely related\nto another that confronts Berkeley: Can two people ever perceive the\nsame thing?  Common sense demands that two students can perceive the\nsame tree, but Berkeley's metaphysics seems to dictate that they never\ntruly perceive the same thing, since they each have their own\nnumerically distinct ideas. One way to dissolve this difficulty is to\nrecall that objects are bundles of ideas.  Although two people cannot\nperceive/have the numerically same idea, they can perceive the same\nobject, assuming that perceiving a component of the bundle suffices\nfor perception of the\n bundle.[21]\n  Another proposal (Baxter 1991) is to invoke Berkeley's doctrine that\n“same” has both a philosophical and a vulgar sense (3D\n247) in order to declare that my tree-idea and your tree-idea are\nstrictly distinct but loosely (vulgarly) the same. Either account\nmight be applied in order to show either that God and I may perceive\nthe same object, or that God and I may perceive, loosely speaking, the\nsame thing.  \n From this discussion we may draw a criterion for the actual existence\nof ordinary objects, one which summarizes Berkeley's considered\nviews: \n\nThis captures the idea that\nexistence depends on God's perceptions, but only on the perceptions\nwhich correspond to or are included in his volitions about what\nwe should perceive. It also captures the fact that the\nbundling of ideas into objects is done by\n us.[22] \n A further worry about Berkeley's system arises from the\nidea-bundle account of\n objects.[23] \n If there is no mind-independent object against which to measure my\nideas, but rather my ideas help to constitute the object, then how can\nmy ideas ever fail—how is error possible?  Here is another way\nto raise the worry that I have in mind: We saw above that\nBerkeley's arguments against commonsense realism in the first\nDialogue attempt to undermine (1) claims that heat, odor,\ntaste are distinguishable from pleasure/pain and (2) the claim that\nobjects have one true color, one true shape, one true taste, etc.  If\nwe then consider what this implies about Berkeleyian objects, we must\nconclude that Berkeley's cherry is red, purple, gray, tart, sweet,\nsmall, large, pleasant, and painful!  It seems that Berkeley's desire\nto refute the mechanist representationalism which dictates that\nobjects are utterly unlike our experience of them has lead\nhim to push beyond common sense to the view that objects are\nexactly like our experience of\n them.[24] \n There is no denying that Berkeley is out of sync with common sense\nhere. He does, however, have an account of error, as he shows us in\nthe Dialogues: \n Philonous. He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actually\nperceives; but in the inferences he makes from his present perceptions.\nThus in the case of the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight is\ncertainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thence\nconclude, that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceive\nthe same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch, as crooked\nthings are wont to do: in that he is mistaken. (3D 238) \n Extrapolating from this, we may say that my gray idea of the cherry,\nformed in dim light, is not in itself wrong and forms a part of the\nbundle-object just as much as your red idea, formed in daylight.\nHowever, if I judge that the cherry would look gray in bright light,\nI'm in error. Furthermore, following Berkeley's directive to speak\nwith the vulgar, I ought not to say (in ordinary circumstances) that\n“the cherry is gray,” since that will be taken to imply\nthat the cherry would look gray to humans in daylight. \n We have spent some time examining the difficulties Berkeley faces in\nthe “idea/ordinary object” half of his ontology.\nArguably, however, less tractable difficulties confront him in the\nrealm of spirits. Early on, Berkeley attempts to forestall materialist\nskeptics who object that we have no idea of spirit by arguing for this\nposition himself: \n Surely the materialist will be tempted to complain, however, that\nBerkeley's unperceivable spiritual substances, lurking behind the\nscenes and supporting that which we can perceive, sound a lot like the\nmaterial substances which he so emphatically rejects.  \n Two very different responses are available to Berkeley on this issue,\neach of which he seems to have made at a different point in his\nphilosophical development. One response would be to reject spiritual\nsubstance just as he rejected material substance.  Spirits, then,\nmight be understood in a Humean way, as bundles of ideas and\nvolitions. Fascinatingly, something like this view is considered by\nBerkeley in his early philosophical notebooks (see PC 577ff). Why he\nabandons it is an interesting and difficult\n question;[25]\n it seems that one worry he has is how the understanding and the will\nare to be integrated and rendered one thing.  \n The second response would be to explain why spiritual substances are\nbetter posits than material ones. To this end, Berkeley emphasizes\nthat we have a notion of spirit, which is just to say that we know\nwhat the word means. This purportedly contrasts with\n“matter,” which Berkeley thinks has no determinate\ncontent. Of course, the real question is: How does the term\n“spirit” come by any content, given that we have no idea\nof it?  In the Principles, Berkeley declares only that we\nknow spirit through our own case and that the content we assign to\n“spirit” is derived from the content each of us assigns to\n“I” (PHK 139–140). In the Dialogues, however,\nBerkeley shows a better appreciation of the force of the problem that\nconfronts him: \n To the main point of Hylas' attack, Philonous replies that each of us\nhas, in our own case, an immediate intuition of ourselves, that is, we\nknow our own minds through reflection (3D 231–233).  Berkeley's\nconsidered position, that we gain access to ourselves as thinking\nthings through conscious awareness, is surely an intuitive\none. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that he never gave an explicit\nresponse to the Humean challenge he entertained in his notebooks: \n A closely related problem which confronts Berkeley is how to make\nsense of the causal powers that he ascribes to spirits. Here again,\nthe notebooks suggest a surprisingly Humean view: \nS   What means Cause as distinguish'd from Occasion? nothing but a Being\nwch wills wn the Effect follows the volition. Those things that happen\nfrom without we are not the Cause of therefore there is some other\nCause of them i.e., there is a being that wills these perceptions in\nus.       499 \nS   There is a difference betwixt Power & Volition. There may be\nvolition without Power. But there can be no Power without Volition.\nPower implyeth volition & at the same time a Connotation of the\nEffects following the Volition.        699 \n 461 suggests the Humean view that a cause is whatever is\n (regularly)[27]\n followed by an effect. 499 and 699 revise this doctrine by requiring\nthat a cause not only (regularly) precede an effect but also be a\nvolition. Berkeley's talk of occasion here reveals the immediate\ninfluence of Malebranche.  Malebranche held that the only true cause\nis God and that apparent finite causes are only “occasional\ncauses,” which is to say that they provide occasions for God to\nact on his general volitional policies. Occasional\n“causes” thus regularly precede their\n“effects” but are not truly responsible for producing\nthem. In these notebook entries, however, Berkeley seems to be\nsuggesting that all there is to causality is this regular consequence,\nwith the first item being a volition. Such an account, unlike\nMalebranche's, would make my will and God's will causes in exactly the\nsame thin sense. \n Some commentators, most notably Winkler, suppose that Berkeley\nretains this view of causality in the published works. The main\ndifficulty with this interpretation is that Berkeley more than once\npurports to inspect our idea of body, and the sensory qualities\nincluded therein, and to conclude from that inspection that bodies are\npassive (DM 22, PHK 25). This procedure would make little sense if\nbodies, according to Berkeley, fail to be causes by definition, simply\nbecause they are not minds with\n wills.[28] \n What is needed is an explanation of what Berkeley means by\nactivity, which he clearly equates with causal power. Winkler (1989,\n130–1) supplies such an account, according to which activity means\ndirection towards an end. But this is to identify efficient causation\nwith final causation, a controversial move at best which Berkeley\nwould be making without comment or argument.  \n The alternative would be to suppose, as De Motu 33 suggests,\nthat Berkeley holds that we gain a notion of activity, along with a\nnotion of spirit as substance, through reflective awareness/internal\nconsciousness: \n  On this interpretation, Berkeley would again have abandoned the\nradical Humean position entertained in his notebooks, as he clearly\ndid on the question of the nature of spirit. One can only speculate as\nto whether his reasons would have been primarily philosophical,\ntheological, or practical. Berkeley's writings, however, are not\ngenerally characterized by deference to authority, quite the\n contrary,[29]\n as he himself proclaims: ","contact.mail":"downing.110@osu.edu","contact.domain":"osu.edu"}]
