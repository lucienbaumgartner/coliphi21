Moreover,\nbecause these arguments are generally used to respond to skeptics who\ntake our knowledge claims to be problematic, the Y in\nquestion is then normally taken to be some fact about us or our mental\nlife which the skeptic can be expected to accept without question\n(e.g., that we have experiences, or make certain judgements, or\nperform certain actions, or have certain capacities, and so on),\nwhere X is then something the skeptic doubts or denies (e.g.,\nthe existence of the external world, or of the necessary causal\nrelation between events, or of other minds, or the force of moral\nreasons). In this way, it is hoped, skepticism can be overturned using\ntranscendental arguments that embody such transcendental claims.\n\n\nAt first sight, this anti-skeptical potential of such arguments makes\nthem seem powerful and attractive, by offering a proof of what\notherwise might seem to be known only through inductive reasoning or\nfallible experience. However, as we shall see, transcendental arguments\nconceived of in this ambitious form have struggled to live up to this\npromise, though they still have their devotees. Nonetheless, the\npotential for such arguments has been kept alive, by reassessing their\npossible uses, where it has been suggested that they can perhaps be\ngiven a more modest role, which then makes them more viable and enables\ntheir apparent difficulties to be set aside. Whether this is indeed the\ncase, and whether even if it is this then leaves them denuded of their\nanti-skeptical value and allure, remains an open question, and will be\ndiscussed further below. We will also consider how far transcendental\narguments can serve a role not just in epistemology in defending our\nclaims to knowledge, but also in ethics, in persuading the skeptic of\nthe force of certain moral considerations and principles.\n\n\n\nAlthough Immanuel Kant rarely uses the term ‘transcendental\nargument’, and when he does it is not in our current sense (cf.\nHookway 1999: 180 n. 8), he nonetheless speaks frequently of\n‘transcendental deductions’, ‘transcendental\nexpositions’, and ‘transcendental proofs’, which\nroughly speaking have the force of what is today meant by\n‘transcendental argument’. Prior exemplars of such\narguments may perhaps by claimed, such as Aristotle’s proof of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (see Metaphysics\n1005b35–1006a28; Illies 2003: 45–6, Walker 2006: 240 and\n255–6); but Kant nonetheless formulated what are generally taken\nto be the central examples of such arguments, so the history of the\ntopic is usually assumed to start here, with the Critique of Pure\nReason and its Transcendental Deduction of the Categories, Second\nAnalogy, and Refutation of Idealism. Briefly put, the Deduction is\ndirected against skepticism concerning the applicability of a priori\nconcepts to our experience; the Second Analogy concerns doubts over\ncausal powers or forces; while the Refutation of Idealism focuses on\nour apparent lack of knowledge concerning the existence of the\nexternal world. \nPerhaps because of its brevity and relative clarity, but also perhaps\nbecause of the hope it can be made ‘self-standing’ and\nindependent of the (to some) disreputable machinery of transcendental\nidealism [see §3 of the entry on\n  Immanuel Kant], it is the Refutation that has\n become the paradigm to many of a transcendental argument. While the\n wisdom of this can be questioned (cf. Bell 1999), the Refutation\nundoubtedly makes a useful place for us to start. \nAs presented by Kant, the Refutation is aimed at the\n‘problematic idealism of Descartes’, who holds that the\nexistence of objects outside us in space is ‘doubtful and\nindemonstrable’ (Kant 1781/1787 B274)—where, as Kant\nfamously remarks in the Preface to the second edition of\nthe Critique in which he comments on the Refutation,\n‘it always remains a scandal of philosophy and universal human\nreason that the existence of things outside us (from which we after\nall get the whole matter for our cognitions, even for our inner sense)\nshould have to be assumed merely on faith, and that if it\noccurs to anyone to doubt it, we should be unable to answer him with a\nsatisfactory proof’ (Kant 1781/1787 Bxxxix note).  Kant’s\nstrategy in response then sets the canonical pattern for a\ntranscendental argument, in beginning from what the skeptic takes for\ngranted, namely that we have mental states which we experience as\nhaving a temporal order, and then arguing for the transcendental claim\nthat experience of this sort would not be possible unless we also had\ngenerally veridical experience of things in space outside us, and thus\nknowledge of the external world. In more detail, the argument can be\npresented as follows (cf. Kant 1781/1787 B275–79 and\nBxxxix–xli note): \n\nTherefore \nTherefore \n\nIn this way, Kant hoped to ‘turn the game played by idealism\nagainst itself’ (cf. B276), by working from the inner experience\nthat it takes for granted and showing that this depends on an outer\nexperience which the idealist doubts, so that in this manner the\n‘scandal to philosophy’ posed by such doubts can finally be\nresolved. \nHowever, despite its brevity, the Refutation has given rise to\nconsiderable dispute and discussion, not only because questions can be\nraised about the details of the argument, but also because Kant’s\nwider theoretical commitments to transcendental idealism have also\nrendered the Refutation problematic and his intentions unclear: for\nexample, doesn’t the argument undermine Kant’s own\nidealism in some way, and how does the Refutation relate to the\nsomewhat similar argument in the Fourth Paralogism of the first edition\nof the Critique (A366–80), but in which an appeal to\ntranscendental idealism plays a greater role? These complications have\nled to a range of disputes concerning the Refutation, from whether or\nnot it can be made cogent, to whether or not it fits within\nKant’s own philosophical project, and indeed whether focusing on\nthis as Kant’s response to skepticism distorts his conception of\nskepticism, and how he thought it should be resolved. (For further\ndiscussion of the Refutation, see Guyer 1987: 279–332, Caranti 2007,\nDicker 2008.) \nTranscendental arguments found a place in philosophy after Kant,\nincluding in the post-Kantian German idealist tradition (cf. Franks\n1999, Franks 2005: 201–59, Taylor 1976, Beiser 2005:\n174–91, Rockmore & Breazeale 2014, Nance 2015; but for some critical\ndiscussion of Taylor see Stern 2013 and Houlgate 2015, and of Beiser\nsee Stern 2012). However, their prominence in more contemporary\nanalytic philosophy is largely due to the work of P. F.  Strawson, and\nparticularly his earlier books Individuals and The Bounds\nof Sense—the latter of which is a commentary on Kant’s\nCritique, while the former is written under its influence in\na broader way (cf. Grundmann 1994; Niquet 1991; Callanan 2011). One\nexample from these works is the ‘objectivity argument’ to\nbe found in The Bounds of Sense, which aims to show that\n‘[u]nity of diverse experiences in a single consciousness\nrequires experience of objects’; the argument may be outlined as\nfollows (see Strawson 1966: 97–112, esp. 108): \nTherefore \n\nIn this way, Strawson hoped to capture what he took to be the\ncentral core of Kant’s position, but without appeal to the\n‘doctrines of transcendental psychology’ (Strawson 1966:\n97), which he found to be problematic. Likewise, in\nIndividuals, Strawson presented an argument starting from the\npremise that we think of the world as containing objective particulars\nin a single spatiotemporal system, to the conclusion that objects\ncontinue to exist unperceived, where the latter is said to required in\norder to make possible the kind of identification and re-identification\nnecessary for the former (cf. Strawson 1959: 31–58). Thus, as Strawson\nfamously put it, the skeptic ‘pretends to accept a conceptual\nscheme’ of a world containing objects in a spatio-temporal\nsystem, ‘but at the same time quietly rejects one of the\nconditions of its employment’ (Strawson 1959: 35). \nOn the basis of the promise of arguments of this sort from Strawson,\nand from others (such as Shoemaker 1963: 168–9), together with growing\ninterest in the work of Kant himself within analytic philosophy, this\nperiod of the late 1950s and early 1960s was a significant one for the\nhistory of transcendental arguments, leading to much subsequent\ndiscussion. At the same time, central Wittgensteinian doctrines\nprominent at the time (such as the notion of ‘criteria’:\nsee §3.3 of the entry on \n other minds) \n were also given a\ntranscendental inflection, so certain Wittgensteinian claims came to\ntake on the form of transcendental arguments (cf. Rorty 1971:3, where\nhe comments that ‘Many admirers of Wittgenstein’s\nPhilosophical Investigations and of Strawson’s\nIndividuals have taken the theme of both books to be an\nanalysis of philosophical skepticism and their distinctive contribution\nto be a new way of criticizing the skeptic’). However, crucial to\nthe debates of the period were also a number of critical articles\npointing to the perceived limitation of the transcendental approach,\nincluding those by Stefan Körner (Körner 1966, 1967, 1969)\nand by Barry Stroud (Stroud 1968), where the latter in particular\nshaped the ensuing discussion over the value of transcendental\narguments and what they could be expected to achieve, as we shall see\nin section 3. \nNonetheless, while the intervention by Stroud and others led to\nsecond-thoughts by some at the meta-level, as theorists asked if these\ncritiques held good and if so what might remain of the transcendental\napproach, this did not deter prominent philosophers continuing to\nproduce transcendental arguments. Two of these may serve as further\nexemplars of the genre, where both have gone on to be much discussed.\nThe first was offered by Hilary Putnam in relation to external world\nskepticism once again, and the second by Donald Davidson, this time\nrelating more directly to the problem of other minds. \nPutnam’s argument comes in Chapter 1 of Reason, Truth and\nHistory, where his goal is to refute a modern-day version of\nDescartes’ evil demon hypothesis, according to which I do not inhabit a\nworld containing ordinary physical objects (trees, tables, houses), but\nI am a brain in a vat in a lab whose experiences are caused by a\ncomputer artificially stimulating my nerve endings, so that none of\nthese objects actually exist beyond my hallucinatory impression of\nthem. This is the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis, and it stands for the\npossibility that, for all I know, nothing rules out the world being\nvery different from how it appears to me to be, given the gap that\nexists between appearance (our experience of it) and reality. \nNow, Putnam’s response to the skeptic is to argue that though we\ncannot rule out the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis on the grounds of how\nthings appear to us, we can rule it out nonetheless. How? Putnam’s\nclaim is that we can rule it out because on a plausible theory of\nreference, it is self-refuting: that is, ‘I am a brain-in-a-vat\n[or BIV, for short]’ cannot be truly affirmed by anyone. The\ntheory of reference Putnam uses as a premise is a causal one, which\nstates that ‘one cannot refer to certain kinds of things,\ne.g., trees, if one has no causal interaction at all with\nthem, or with things in terms of which they can be described’\n(Putnam 1981: 16–17). Putnam defends this theory, on the grounds\nthat it alone can explain how reference occurs in a way that is not\n‘magical’, i.e., which does not assume that the connection\nis just somehow intrinsic between representations and their\nreferents. It then follows, according to Putnam, that a BIV affirming\n‘I am a BIV’ is saying something true only if the BIV is\nin what the BIV is calling a ‘vat’. But the BIV is not in\none of those; rather, he is in a real vat. What he is calling\na ‘vat’ is that to which his use of that term causally\nconnects in a referential way—where for a BIV, that is something\nin the computer that prompts his applications of ‘vat’ by\ngiving him hallucinations of the appearance of vats. Yet the BIV is\nnot in that part of the computer. Thus, Putnam concludes, ‘I am\na BIV’ cannot be truly asserted by anyone, much like ‘I do\nnot exist’ or ‘I cannot construct a meaningful\nsentence’ (cf. Bardon 2005). It therefore cannot ever be wrong\nto assert that one is not a BIV, so that in this sense ‘I am not\na BIV’ is an incorrigible claim (cf. Putnam 1981:\n14–15). Putnam therefore holds that we can rule out the BIV\nhypothesis on a priori grounds, and thus refute the skeptic. \nPutnam is keen to emphasise the transcendental nature of his enterprise\nin this respect. He stresses that the kinds of constraints on reference\nthat operate here and disprove the BIV hypothesis are not physical or\nmerely analytic, but involve limitations on what is possible that can\nbe arrived at through philosophical reflection on the nature of\nrepresentation and meaning, and hence fit into a broadly Kantian model\nof how to respond to skepticism, albeit with more empirical\nelements: \n\nAs a result of his attempt to respond to external world skepticism\nin this way, Putnam has had an important influence in reviving interest\nin the possibility of using transcendental arguments against\nskepticism. (For further discussion of Putnam’s position, see\nBrueckner 1986, Coppock 1987, Heil 1987, David 1991, Brueckner 1992,\nCaranti 2007: 110–13.) \nFinally, we may turn to the work of Donald Davidson, who like Putnam\nbases his transcendental claim on a form of externalism, which links\nthe content of our mental states to how we relate to our environment;\nbut in his case, this idea is directed against skepticism concerning\nother minds. Thus, while the skeptic holds that the existence of such\nminds is doubtful, Davidson argues that it would not be possible for a\ncreature like me to have thoughts unless I lived in a world with other\ncreatures who also had thoughts, so the truth of the latter can be\ndeduced from the fact that I am indeed capable of thinking: ‘What are\nthe conditions necessary for the existence of thought, and so in\nparticular for the existence of people with thoughts? I believe there\ncould not be thoughts in one mind if there were no other thoughtful\ncreatures with which the first mind shared a natural world’ (Davidson\n1989: 193). Davidson’s transcendental argument is based on his account\nof what it takes for a thought to have content, for which he argues\nthat a process of ‘triangulation’ must occur, whereby the content of\nthe thought someone is having is ‘fixed’ by the way in which someone\nelse correlates the responses he makes to something in the world. Thus,\nDavidson argues, if there were no other people, the content of our\nthoughts would be totally indeterminate, and we would in effect have no\nthoughts at all; from the self-evident falsity of the latter, he\ntherefore deduces the falsity of the former (cf. Davidson 1991:\n159–60). Davidson therefore argues that the mistake the skeptic makes,\nin common with the Cartesian heritage of which he is part, is in the\nassumption that it is possible to be a lone thinker:\nDavidson’s transcendental argument is designed to show that this\nis not in fact the case, given the constraints on what it takes to have\nthoughts with content, so that the existence of a single thinking\nsubject entails the existence of others. \nAs Davidson suggests (cf. Davidson 1991: 157), his position here might\nbe said to have certain similarities to that put forward in\nWittgenstein’s Private Language Argument, at least under the\ninterpretation given by Kripke (see Kripke 1982). Kripke takes\nWittgenstein as arguing that it is impossible to make sense of what it\nis to follow a rule correctly, unless this means that what one is doing\nis following the practice of others who are like-minded: what makes our\ncontinuation of some addition rule a case of rule-following at all (for\nexample), is that the community goes on in the same way; and, unless\naddition were rule-governed as a practice, statements like ‘2+2=4’\ncould have no meaning. Thus, from the fact that we are able to make\nsuch statements meaningfully, the existence of a community of others\nthat ‘fix’ this rule can be inferred, as a necessary pre-condition for\nthe former (cf. Kripke 1982: 89). On this view, then, unless the\nskeptic is prepared to admit the existence of this community of\nfellow-speakers, and thus attribute a capacity for intentional\nrule-following to those around him, he cannot make sense of the idea of\nmeaningful thought in his own case. \nWe have therefore seen that taking their inspiration from Kant to a\ngreater or lesser degree, philosophers have come to develop a range of\ntranscendental arguments that are intended to refute skepticism in a\nrobust and ambitious manner, by establishing anti-skeptical conclusions\non the basis of transcendental claims. From these exemplars and others,\ntherefore, we may now say something further about how such arguments\nwork and what makes them distinctive. \n\nFrom something like the canon of transcendental arguments outlined\nabove, the characteristic marks of such arguments might be listed as\nfollows: \n\n1. Transcendental arguments are anti-skeptical, so that (as Strawson\nputs it) it is widely assumed that ‘the point of transcendental\narguments in general is an anti-sceptical point’ (Strawson 1985:\n10). Moreover, in the ambitious form in which we have considered them\nso far, they refute the skeptic in a direct manner, by purporting to\nprove what she doubts or questions, and they do so on their own,\nwithout bringing in any wider epistemological theories or\nconsiderations. And these arguments are what is sometimes called\nworld-directed or ­truth-directed (cf. Peacocke\n1989: 4; Cassam 1997: 33; Cassam 1999: 83): that is, they set out to\nestablish the truth of some claim about how reality is and what it\ncontains (such as subject-independent objects in space and time, or\nother minds, or causal laws). \n\n2. Because of their anti-skeptical ambitions, transcendental\narguments must begin from a starting point that the skeptic can be\nexpected to accept, the necessary condition of which is then said to be\nsomething that the skeptic doubts or denies. This will then mean that\nsuch arguments are ineffective against very radical forms of\nskepticism, which doubt the laws of logic, and/or which refuse to\naccept any starting point as uncontentious; and it will also\nmean that they may be effective against a skeptic who is prepared to\naccept some starting point, but then ineffective against another\nskeptic who is not. But neither of these features of transcendental\narguments need be felt to be disabling: for the skepticism of the\nradical skeptics is perhaps of dubious coherence, or at least of little\ninterest because they seem so unwilling to engage with us, while the\nsecond limitation may mean merely that different transcendental\narguments are required for different skeptical audiences. \n\n3. Because of the need to find an uncontentious starting point,\ntranscendental arguments will also then characteristically be first\npersonal, by beginning from how I or we experience,\nthink, judge, and so on. Thus, while it is perhaps reasonable to hold\nthat there are necessary conditions for the possibility of\n‘extra-personal’ entities such as material objects,\nsubstances, the universe, time and so on, a transcendental argument\nwhich is directed against skepticism is unlikely to be concerned with\nexploring such conditions, as the skeptic is unlikely to admit the\nexistence of the things to which the conditions belong. \n\n4. Transcendental arguments involve transcendental claims,\nto the effect that X is a necessary condition for the\npossibility of Y, where in saying this, the arguments do not\nassume this to be a matter of merely causal or natural necessity. Given\nthat their target is the skeptic who challenges our claims about the\nworld, there are clearly two good reasons for this. First, although our\nobservation of the world might suggest that experience has certain\nnecessary causal conditions (e.g., light and sound must be transmitted\nbetween particular wavelengths), we can hardly use such considerations\nagainst a skeptic of this sort, for whom all such empirical knowledge\nis in question, and against whom we are therefore required to adopt a\nposition that is less open to doubt in this way. Second, if the\ntranscendental argument’s claim is one of only natural necessity,\nthen this allows that there are possible worlds (for example, where the\nlaws of physics do not hold) in which this claim is false, again\nopening us up to the skeptical challenge of showing we are not in such\na world. \n\n5. However, if the transcendental claims involved are not a matter of\nmerely causal or natural necessity, this then raises the question of\nwhat form of necessity they do in fact involve. If they were\ntrue in virtue of their meaning alone (even if unobviously so), and\nthus analytic, then the necessity might be said to be purely logical,\nwhere to deny the claim is then to assert some form of logical\ncontradiction (cf. Bennett 1979, Walker 1978: 18–23, Walker\n1989: 63–4, Bell 1999). However, this may not seem to be the\ncase in many instances of such transcendental claims, where in fact\nthey may be said to be synthetic a priori (cf. Wilkerson 1976:\n199–213), while the whole analytic/synthetic distinction is\nitself fraught with difficulty. To many, nonetheless, it has appeared\nthat the transcendental claim is not a logical necessity, but stands\nsomewhere between that and natural necessity, perhaps putting it into\nthe camp of metaphysical necessity, as this is sometimes\nunderstood: that is, a necessary relation which holds not by virtue of\nlogical or causal constraints on the nature of logical or physical\npossibilities, but by virtue of metaphysical constraints on how things\ncan be—much as the fact that nothing can be red and green all\nover is arguably not determined by any law of logic or causal law, but\nthe nature of colour, and how it can be exemplified in things. \n\n6. It is then partly because of the apparently rather special nature\nof these transcendental claims, that the suspicion arises that there\nwill then turn out to be something distinctively Kantian about such\narguments; for Kant made it the focus of his critical project to\naccount for metaphysical knowledge of this sort, where transcendental\nidealism is then supposed to provide the answer to how such knowledge\nis possible. The idea, roughly speaking, is that it is too much for us\nto be able to know how things must be beyond the limits of our\nexperience, and so claim metaphysical knowledge of\nthings-in-themselves. By contrast, once we confine ourselves to how\nthings appear to us given our ways of seeing and thinking about the\nworld, then we can understand how we could at least acquire knowledge\nof how things must behave as phenomena, by knowing about the forms of\nintuitions and concepts through which such phenomena must appear to us\nif we are to experience them at all (cf. Williams 1974, Pippin 1988,\nStroud 1999, Stroud 2000a). However, as we saw in the case of Strawson,\nwhether or not such full-blooded Kantian commitments are necessary to\nthe transcendental argument strategy is a matter of dispute. Indeed,\nsome have argued that there is a ‘neglected alternative’\nhere: namely, while Kant might be right to hold that we cannot\nplausibly claim insight into the constraints on the world itself but\nonly on the nature of our sensibility and understanding, nonetheless we\ncan argue from this that the world must itself be a certain way to fit\nthese conditions, without thereby thinking that it is mind-dependent or\nthat all we thereby know is how things appear to us. The analogy is\nthus drawn to a case such as the following: once we know how our lungs\nwork, we can know what the air must be like in order to allow us to\nbreath, where the latter is not in any way constituted by the former or\nan ‘appearance’ of anything more fundamental (cf. Harrison\n1989, Westphal 2004: 68–126). \n\nThe features discussed above therefore have a reasonable claim to be\nwhat make transcendental arguments distinctive, at least of the sort we\nhave considered so far. However, as we shall now go on to see,\ntranscendental arguments of this type have turned out to be open to\nserious objections, so that alternative models have been proposed which\ndo not incorporate all these features in quite the same way. \n\nJust as the rise in interest in transcendental arguments within\ntwentieth-century philosophy can largely be traced back to the work of\nStrawson, so too the subsequent disillusionment can largely be traced\nback to the work of one person, namely Barry Stroud in his influential\n1968 article (Stroud 1968). In that paper, Stroud focused on the nature\nof the transcendental claim that the truth of some proposition\nS is a necessary condition for the possibility of language,\nbut then argued that ‘the sceptic can always very plausibly\ninsist that it is enough to make language possible if we\nbelieve that S is true, or that it looks for all the\nworld as if it is, but that S needn’t actually be\ntrue’ (Stroud 1968 [2000b: 24]). Moreover, the general problem\nthis raises is that if such a response by the skeptic is plausible in\nthe case of language, perhaps it is also plausible in the case of other\nstarting-points too? Thus, for example, when it comes to skepticism\nabout the existence of the external world or other minds, maybe no\nargument can be constructed to show there must actually be\nsuch a world or minds as a condition for inner experience or the having\nof thoughts, but just that we must believe them to exist, or that they\nmust seem to us to do so—which hardly looks like enough to\nquash skeptical doubts on these matters. \nNow, in the 1968 paper, Stroud appears to get to his conclusion by\narguing from an analysis of specific cases (viz. arguments proposed by\nStrawson and Shoemaker in Strawson 1959 and Shoemaker 1963\nrespectively). But then, this may seem to leave open the hope that even\nif these arguments fall to his critique, others may not. However, in\nsubsequent work, Stroud has said more to substantiate his objection and\nmake it seem more likely to hold across the board. For, while he allows\nthat we might reasonably be able to make modal claims about ‘how\nour thinking in certain ways necessarily requires that we also think in\ncertain other ways’, he believes it is puzzling\n‘how…truths about the world which appear to say or imply\nnothing about human thought or experience’ (for example, that\nthings exist outside us in space and time, or that there are other\nminds) ‘[can] be shown to be genuinely necessary conditions of\nsuch psychological facts as that we think and experience things in\ncertain ways, from which the proofs begin’. Stroud goes on:\n‘It would seem that we must find, and cross, a bridge of\nnecessity from the one to the other. That would be a truly remarkable\nfeat, and some convincing explanation would surely be needed of how the\nwhole thing is possible’ (Stroud 1994 [2000b: 158–9; cf. also\n212]). Thus, Stroud is prepared to allow ‘that we can come to see\nhow our thinking in certain ways necessarily requires that we also\nthink in certain other ways, and so perhaps in certain other ways as\nwell, and we can appreciate how rich and complicated the relations\nbetween those ways of thinking must be’ (Stroud 1994 [2000b:\n158–9]); but he believes that anything more than this, which asserts\nthat ‘non-psychological facts’ about the world outside us\nconstitute necessary conditions for our thinking, is problematic. \nThen, having apparently established that the strongest defensible\ntranscendental claims concern merely how things must appear to us or\nwhat we must believe, the second stage of Stroud’s argument is\nthat in order to bridge the gap that this has opened up, and to get to\na conclusion about how things actually are, one must opt\neither for verificationism or idealism. The former holds that in order\nto be meaningful, a sentence must say something that we can determine to\nbe true or false. If so, then we cannot be left in the limbo of\nskeptical doubt behind a veil of appearances wondering where the truth\nlies. The latter sees no gap between how the world is and how we think\nthings are or merely appear to us. However, aside from the potentially\nproblematic nature of both these positions, an appeal to either\nverificationism or idealism is also dialectically unsatisfactory, as\nany such appeal would appear to render the transcendental argument\nitself redundant—for each on its own is powerful enough to\ndisarm skeptical worries, without the transcendental manoeuvre now\nbeing required (cf. Stroud 1968 [2000b: 24–5]). In this way, Stroud has\nconvinced many that the proponent of transcendental arguments faces an\nunattractive dilemma: either to dispense with verificationism or\nidealism, but fall short of the anti-skeptical conclusion concerning\nhow things are; or to accept verificationism or idealism, but then make\nthe transcendental argument itself superfluous. \nThe problem that Stroud has highlighted may be briefly illustrated by\nreturning to the exemplars of transcendental arguments that we\nconsidered in Section 1. Thus, when it comes to Kant’s Refutation\nof Idealism, it can be said that the most that Kant really establishes\nis that we have experience as of things outside us in space,\nwhile all that Strawson’s objectivity argument shows is that we\nmust apply the is/seems distinction to our experience, and so\nbelieve that things exist without us experiencing them, but that this\ndoesn’t do enough to show that this distinction is really a valid\none (cf. Wilkerson 1976: 57, Brueckner 1989). Likewise, against Putnam\nit is argued that the skeptic can challenge his externalist theory of\nreference, where on a more internalist view, you could then think about\nbeing in a vat even if you were in one, as the meaning of\n‘vat’ no longer depends on your relations to the world; or,\nif Putnam insists on his externalism, it could be claimed that this is\nalready a position that rules out skepticism because it\nassumes that the mind and world are linked in important ways, making it\nunnecessary to make appeal to the specific transcendental argument that\nPutnam rests upon it (cf. McCulloch 1999). Similarly, against Davidson\nit can be argued that thought would be possible, even if the\n‘others’ with which one ‘triangulated’ were\nnothing but robots or automata; or again, if this is ruled out by\nappeal to some form of semantic externalism, this then renders the\ntranscendental argument redundant. In all these cases, therefore, it\nmay appear that Stroudian objections can be used to damaging\neffect. \nThus, applying Stroud’s concerns to a range of arguments in this\nway may seem to support the view that the transcendental arguments so\nfar produced succumb to his dilemma (although, of course, attempts to\nbolster the arguments can also be made). Nonetheless, it might be felt\nthat unless Stroud can substantiate his more principled objection to\nthe very possibility of crossing the ‘bridge of necessity’\nthat is required by any sort of world-directed transcendental claim, he\nhas still not yet established conclusively that no transcendental\nargument can be made to work, and must always either fall short or end\nup being superfluous. So the question arises: how powerful is his\nsuggestion that a ‘truly remarkable feat’ is required here,\none that we have good reason to think cannot feasibly be\naccomplished? \nPerhaps one difficulty that can be raised for Stroud, is that while he\nthinks there is something inherently problematic in making a claim\nabout how the world must be as a condition for our thought or\nexperience, he does not think that there is anything particularly\nproblematic about claiming that our thought or experience is a\nnecessary condition for some other aspect of our thought or experience\n– indeed, he exploits such claims himself in his own arguments\nagainst the skeptic (cf. Stroud 1994 [2000b: 165–76]). But how can\nclaims of necessary connections between some thoughts or experience and\nsome others be defended more cogently than claims of necessary\nconnections between some thoughts or experience and the world? Why are\nsuch ‘bridges’ or modal connections easier to make\n‘within thought’ than between how we think and how the\nworld must be to make that thought possible? Now, one might take this\nsymmetry between the two to be reason to be suspicious of modal claims\nof this sort at any level: but as we have seen, Stroud himself\nseems to think they are viable between ‘psychological\nfacts’ (cf. Stroud 2000a [2000b: 224–44]). If so, it could be\nargued, he needs to give us some account of why they are less\nproblematic here than between our thought and the world; but in fact he\njust seems to take it to be obvious, and so provides no such account\n(cf. Cassam 1987: 356–7; Glock 2003: 38–9). \nHowever, even if Stroud’s position is indeed weaker than it may\nat first appear, this does not mean that transcendental arguments are\nin the clear when it comes to the world-directed transcendental claims\nthey embody. For, a different worry to the same effect can also be\nurged against them, which in this case relates to the dialectics of our\nengagements with skepticism (cf. Stern 2007). The central thought is\nthis: On the one hand, the skeptic is often conceived as grounding her\ndoubts on the fallibility of our ordinary belief-forming processes,\nsuch as perception and memory. On the other hand, the proponent of a\ntranscendental argument hopes to answer her doubts by advancing the\nclaim that X is a necessary condition for the possibility of\nY and so deduce the former from the latter. But the\ndialectical concern this raises is this: why, if the skeptic is\ndubious about cognitive methods like perception and memory, should she\nbe any more sanguine about the methods we have used (whatever these\nare) to arrive at the modal claims embodied in the transcendental\nargument? \nNow, one line of response might be to say that the doubts the skeptic\nraises over our modal knowledge here can themselves be blocked or shown\nto be spurious, for example, by providing evidence for the reliability\nof our methods in the modal case, or questioning the right of the\nskeptic to use the mere possibility of error against such knowledge.\nBut then, it seems likely that similar claims could also be\nused to bolster the credentials of our non-transcendental\nbases for knowledge, such as perception and memory, in a way that would\nthen render the transcendental argument redundant. \nThus, even if Stroud’s own critique of transcendental arguments\nis found wanting, it seems that another along these lines can be put in\nits place, leading to a similar dilemma: either transcendental\narguments are offered to try to establish what the skeptic questions,\nbut are then vulnerable to skeptical doubts concerning the truth of the\nmodal claims they employ; or they can successfully respond to those\ndoubts, but in ways that then seem likely to render our\nnon-transcendental grounds for knowledge legitimate too, so that our\nconviction concerning such knowledge no longer seems to need to make\nany appeal to a transcendental argument. \n\nWhile it would be premature to say that attempts to construct\nambitious world-directed transcendental arguments have been entirely\nabandoned (see e.g., Peacocke 1989, Grundmann & Misselhorn 2003),\nnonetheless the most common way of responding to these Stroudian\ndifficulties has been to re-think how transcendental arguments might\nbe best used, and to come up with strategies that are in various ways\nmore modest than those we have discussed so far. What characterises\nsuch modest responses is the idea that Stroud is indeed right\nthat all we can really substantiate by way of a transcendental claim\nis how things must appear to us or how we must believe them to\nbe—but then attempt to make this weakened claim do some\nanti-skeptical work. I will briefly consider four such responses: one\nfrom Strawson’s earlier work; one from his later writings; one from\nStroud; and one from Stern 2000. \nThe first response takes its inspiration from a re-consideration of the\nStrawsonian transcendental arguments that were criticised by Stroud,\nbut offers a different interpretation of them in the light of that\ncritique. Thus, it is suggested, the mistake is to see Strawson’s\nargument as straightforwardly world-directed in the way that it was\npresented earlier, as offering a direct response to the skeptic by\nproving what the skeptic doubts. Rather, it is said, the strategy is\nmore like Aristotle’s elenchic response to the skeptic who doubts\nthe principle of non-contradiction: namely, to show that her doubts\ncannot be intelligibly stated or expressed, as acceptance of this\nprinciple is a necessary condition for having meaningful thought at\nall. Likewise, therefore, it can be suggested that Strawson intended\nhis transcendental approach to operate in the same way, where (as\nStrawson puts it) ‘[the skeptic’s] doubts are unreal, not\nsimply because they are logically unresolvable doubts, but because they\namount to the rejection of the whole conceptual scheme within which\nalone such doubts make sense’ (Strawson 1959: 35; cf. also 106\nand 109, and also Glock 2003: 35–6 and Illies 2003: 44–56). Thus, it\nmay seem, a modest transcendental claim is all that we require, to the\neffect that the skeptic cannot raise a doubt to challenge us here,\ngiven what she must believe in order for her to think or utter anything\nintelligible at all. The transcendental argument is effective,\ntherefore, not by showing that what the skeptic doubts is false, but by\nshowing that those doubts have violated the conditions of\nmeaningfulness, and thus require no positive answer or response. \nNow, whether or not this is the most charitable way of reading\nStrawson’s earlier position, he himself does not seem to have\nadopted quite this first response when he came to reply to Stroud in\nhis later work. Rather, while he accepts Stroud’s insistence that\nthe transcendental claim must be weakened (cf. Strawson 1985: 9), he\nthen also offers what he call a naturalistic reply to the\nskeptic based on Hume and also on some Wittgensteinian ideas developed\nin On Certainty, according to which the right approach to\nskeptical doubts is not to try to answer them with an argument, but to\nshow them to be ‘idle’, as unable to shift those core\nbeliefs which are implanted in us by nature or which lie at the centre\nof our ways of thinking (cf. Strawson 1985: 13). Here, then, the\napproach is not about the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of\nskeptical doubt (as on the first response), but on its inability to\nshift or dislodge our beliefs because of their embeddedness within our\nthinking (where semantic issues need not be the only consideration in\nrendering them embedded in this way). Within this naturalistic\napproach, therefore, Strawson suggests that transcendental arguments\ncan do valuable work, in precisely helping us to show the skeptic that\nsome beliefs are fundamental to us in this way, and thus impervious to\nskeptical doubt just as the naturalist claims—but where to play\nthis role, the transcendental claim only has to be a modest one,\nconcerning what we must believe, not how things are (cf. Strawson 1985:\n21–23; see also Grayling 1985 and Callanan 2011). \nA third type of modest approach is offered by Stroud himself, where he\nclaims that even a transcendental argument which shows what we must\nbelieve can have anti-skeptical value, in showing that these beliefs\nare indispensible and invulnerable, in the sense that\nwe not only cannot abandon them, but also we cannot find them to be\nfalse in ourselves or others, because to so find them would be to give\nup believing anything at all. However, Stroud allows that this sort of\nstatus for the belief in question—for example, the belief that\nthere are enduring particulars, or other minds—does not go as far\nas ruling out the possibility that belief of this sort are in fact not\ntrue (see Stroud 1994, 1999). \nFinally, in Stern 2000, it is argued that modest transcendental\narguments can be shown to be useful against skepticism, once we\ndistinguish sufficiently carefully between the kinds of skepticism\nthere are, and go for the right target or targets—where a less\ndemanding form of skepticism may perhaps be defeated by a less\nambitious transcendental claim. So, for example, if we take the target\nto be a skeptic who demands certainty, then a modest transcendental\nargument will not suffice. But if we take the skeptic to be one who\ndemands merely justification that may nonetheless be fallible, and who\nclaims we do not have even this because our beliefs are not properly\nsupported by our generally accepted cognitive norms, then (it is\nclaimed) a modest transcendental argument can indeed be useful. So, for\nexample, the justificatory skeptic may claim that our belief in other\nminds seems to be grounded on nothing but the link between behaviour\nand mentality that we observe in our own case; but then, she can argue,\nit is based on little more than a poor argument from analogy, which we\nare not properly warranted in extending to others, as we are arguing\nfrom only a single instance (viz., ourselves), which is an inadequate\ninductive base on which to reason in this way. In response, however, it\ncould be argued that unless others appeared to us as more than mere\nbodies, but instead as persons with minds, we could not acquire the\ncapacity to apply mentalistic predicates to ourselves, and thus become\nself-conscious. This argument remains ‘modest’ because its\ntranscendental claim extends only to how others must appear to us, and\nso is not ‘world-directed’ in the manner of more ambitious\ntranscendental arguments; but even so, the idea is, it is still\nsufficient to show that our belief in these other minds is not merely\nbased on a faulty inference in the way that the justificatory skeptic\nsupposes, but rather on the nature of our experience—where as such,\nit can therefore be used to show that this belief is warranted, even if\nit could still be false. \nNow, none of these approaches is unobjectionable, and it remains to be\nseen which, if any, is to be preferred. Concern about the Aristotelian\napproach can relate to whether it can show that belief in X\nis necessary for intelligible thought in general, or for\nthought by creatures like us—where if it only\nestablishes the latter, the possibility of a skeptic raising\nintelligible doubts about it would seem to remain, while establishing\nthe former seems extremely demanding if not impossible\n(cf. Körner 1967). Further, the worry might be raised in a\nStroudian spirit, that all this approach shows is that doubts cannot\nbe expressed concerning X, but where that then seems to fall\nshort of establishing that X is really the case. And finally,\nwhile it may perhaps seem right to say that there is something\nunintelligible or meaningless about questioning the principle of\nnon-contradiction (although this can also be challenged: cf. Priest\n1987), other skeptical doubts do not seem problematic to the same\ndegree. (For further discussion points of this sort, see Illies 2003:\n54–63.) Along similar lines, critics have also questioned\nStrawson’s naturalistic approach, as not fully answering the skeptical\nchallenge: for even if a doubt here is ‘idle’, it does not\nfollow that what is questioned is really true (cf. Valberg 1992:\n168–96, Sen 1995). Likewise, when it comes to Stroud’s position,\nas he himself admits, the indispensability and invulnerability he\nspeaks of ‘might not seem like much reassurance in the face of a\ngeneral scepticism’ (Stroud 1999: 168), given that it not only\ndoes not rule out the possibility of falsity, but also seemingly gives\nno additional reasons for taking that possibility less\nseriously. Moreover, it has been suggested that Stroud’s position is\nunstable, as the claim that certain beliefs are invulnerable on the\none hand, and the acceptance that they might be untrue on the other,\nseem to stand in tension with one another (see Brueckner 1996). The\nposition proposed in Stern 2000 tries to get round these difficulties,\nbut has also been accused of ducking important aspects of the\nskeptic’s challenge (see e.g., Sacks 1999 and 2000: 276–85; and\nfor Sack’s own positive proposals, see Sacks 2005a, 2005b and\n2006). Finally, for an attempt to adopt an approach that is neither\nambitious or modest, but somewhere between the two, see McDowell\n2006.  Whatever their respective strengths and weaknesses, one thing\nthese modest strategies have suggested is that some of the central\nfeatures of transcendental arguments outlined above do not fit\narguments of this less ambitious sort. Thus, these arguments are not\nworld-directed, but are experience- or belief-directed. Secondly, they\ndo not expect the transcendental arguments to refute the skeptic on\ntheir own (as it were), but in conjunction with broader\nepistemological or anti-skeptical considerations (such as naturalism,\nor perceptual and other epistemic norms). Thirdly, by offering an\napproach that is more modest, they raise the question of how much\nadequate responses to skepticism are entitled to assume and what kinds\nof reassurance they are meant to provide (cf. Hookway 1999; Cassam\n2007: 51–84; Wang 2012). And in all these ways, they have raised exegetical\nissues about how Kant’s place in the canon discussed above might be\nunderstood differently, concerning his attitude to skepticism and\nwhether in the end his intentions are best interpreted in\n‘modest’ or more ambitious terms (cf.  Callanan 2006;\nBardon 2006; Stapelford 2008). \n\nAs we have seen, then, when it comes to transcendental arguments in\nepistemology, most of the effort in recent years has been concentrated\nat the meta-level, concerning what transcendental arguments are and\nwhat they can be expected to achieve: when it comes to examples of\ntranscendental arguments themselves, very few new ones have actually\nbeen proposed. However, the picture is different in ethics, where\nattempts to produce such arguments are still being made, so that while\nepistemology perhaps remains their natural home, the use of\ntranscendental arguments in ethics is of undoubted significance (see for example Brune, Stern and Werner (eds.) 2017).\nMoreover, as with such arguments in epistemology, when it comes to\ntranscendental claims in ethics, Kant may again be taken as an important\ninspiration, especially Kant 1785.  In fact, in view of what was said previously regarding the\nproblems of transcendental arguments, it is perhaps not really\nsurprising that ethicists have had fewer qualms in producing\nthem. For, as we saw, the difficulty when it comes to external world\nskepticism, other minds skepticism, and the like, is in finding an\nargument that will successfully cross Stroud’s ‘bridge of\nnecessity’, and establish a conclusion concerning how things\nare, rather than how things must appear or how we must believe them to\nbe, and so reach a conclusion that will satisfy the realist about such\nmatters. However, in ethics, it is much more acceptable to reject\nrealism, and to adopt a more anti-realist position of some sort at the\noutset (cf. Rähme forthcoming); as a result, the most that will be\ncalled for is a modest transcendental argument which is not\nworld-directed, as many ethicists do not want to treat moral values\nand norms as part of the ‘world’ anyway, and so see no\nvictory for the skeptic in failing to establish any more ambitious\nconclusion, where this may still be a worry in the epistemological\ncases.  While until recently there was only a limited discussion of\ntranscendental arguments in ethics within the ‘analytic’\ntradition of Anglo-American philosophy (see e.g., Phillips-Griffiths\n1957–8; Watt 1975; Harrison 1976; Cooper 1976; Finnis 1977\nargues for the value of truth), they have played a significant role in\nthe social philosophy of thinkers such as Karl-Otto Apel and\nJürgen Habermas. Apel has argued that an ethical perspective is\nrequired as a condition for a commitment to truth, inquiry and\nsuccessful communication. Habermas denies this, where instead he\nthinks that we are committed to communication and discourse by the\npragmatic implications of speech oriented towards reaching\nunderstanding of each other, which for us, as speaking beings, is\nunavoidable. Both may be said to be inspired by C. S. Peirce’s\ninsistence on the relation between truth and consensus, where the\nsearch for consensus is said to require as a necessary condition that\nwe have certain ethical attitudes to others, such as equal respect and\ntolerance for their views and commitments. (See Apel 1976b vol II/1980\nand 1976a; Habermas 1983. For further discussion see Benhabib and\nDallmayr (eds.) 1995; Illies 2003: 64–92 and Kuhlmann\nforthcoming. A comparable form of transcendental argument is\nattributed to Emmanuel Levinas in Perpich 2008: 124–149; cf. also Stern 2016. For a\nbroader discussion of transcendental arguments concerning\nintersubjectivity in the ‘continental’ tradition more generally, see\nChase & Reynolds 2011: 89–114 and Russell & Reynolds\n2011.) \nMoreover, transcendental claims have been given a more prominent role\nwithin recent Anglo-American ethical theory, largely through the work\nof Alan Gewirth and Christine Korsgaard. These arguments start not from\nclaims about truth and communication, but from claims about our nature\nas human agents, and what we must then presuppose about the moral\nstatus of ourselves and others. As in epistemology, the promise of such\narguments in ethics has generated much interest and attention. For\nillustration, we will discuss a transcendental argument in ethics\nproposed by Korsgaard. (For Gewirth, see Gewirth 1981; Beyleveld 1991;\nand Illies 2003: 93–128.) \nKorsgaard’s use of a transcendental argument in fact forms only\npart of a wider response to skeptical worries about the demands of\nmorality (‘the normative question’), and is deployed merely\nto convince the skeptic that her own humanity has value, from which a\nfurther argument concerning the publicity of reasons is used to show\nthat she must also then value the humanity of others. The\ntranscendental argument that Korsgaard proposes is modelled on a\nposition which she finds in Kant and which she outlines as\nfollows: \n\nThis argument can be laid out as follows: \n\nConsider this example. To rationally choose to eat this piece of\nchocolate cake, I must think that eating the cake is good in some way. How\ncan I regard it as good? It seems implausible to say that eating the cake is\ngood in itself, of intrinsic value. It also seems implausible to say\nthat it is good just because it satisfies a desire as such: for even\nif I was bulimic it might do that, but still not be regarded as\ngood. A third suggestion, then, is that it can be seen as good because\nit is good for me, as satisfying a genuine need or desire of mine. But\nif I think this is what makes eating the piece of cake good, I must value\nmyself, as otherwise I could not hold that satisfying me is sufficient\nto make something good enough for it to be rational for me to choose to do\nit; so I must regard myself as valuable. Put conversely: suppose that\nyou thought that you and your life were utterly worthless, pointless,\nmeaningless—that in your eyes, you were valueless. And suppose\nthat you are faced with a piece of cake: on what basis would you choose\nit eat it? It seems unlikely that there is something intrinsically\ngood about eating it, or that you should do so just because you find\nyourself with a desire to do so, even while finding your existence\nvalueless. It seems that the only reason to do so would be if you\nthought eating the cake brought you some genuine benefit—but if\nyou thought your life was worthless, how could you see this as a\nreason either? Why is bringing benefit to something that in your eyes\nis so utterly without value a reasonable thing to do? \nThere are some dangers in this argument, however. One, which Korsgaard\nconsiders, is that it might lead to ‘self-conceit’\n(Korsgaard 1998: 54. Cf. also Korsgaard 1996: 249–50): that is, I might\nconclude from this that I am supremely valuable, simply as Bob Stern,\nwhich could obviously then get in the way of my ethical treatment of\nothers. But, this worry might be lessened by the thought that while the\nargument gets me to see that I must find something valuable about me,\nit need not be anything about me in particular, and perhaps could\ninstead be something about me that is more general—such as my\nhumanity or personhood. However, while Korsgaard says that reflection\nwill indeed lead us in this more general direction, we will need to see\nhow. A second, perhaps related, worry is that this argument has a\ntroubling parallel in the case of Satan, where Satan goes through (1)\nto (4) above, and concludes that he must regard his devilish nature as\nvaluable. If this argument somehow entitles us to regard our own\nhumanity or personhood as valuable, why doesn’t it entitle Satan\nto think the same about his nature? This is not the same as\nself-conceit, because he is not valuing himself as Satan just qua\nSatan; he is valuing his nature, just as we are valuing ours. Nor does\ndevilishness seem any less central to his nature than humanity is to\nours. So it is hard to see how the Satanic parallel can be avoided by\nthe argument as it stands. \nNonetheless, it is possible that something can be built on the central\nidea of the argument, which seems to be this: As long as we think we\ncan act for reasons based on the value of things, but at the same time\nreject any realism about that value applying to things independently of\nus, then we must be treated as the source of value and in a way that\nmakes rational choice possible. We can therefore see Korsgaard’s\nsecond argument as attempting something along these lines, using her\nnotion of practical identity to perhaps avoid the two problems we have\nidentified with the Kantian argument. \nHere, then, is an outline of Korsgaard’s second argument: \n\nThe first step is now familiar: To act is to do or choose something\nfor a reason. The second step is based on Korsgaard’s idea that\nwe have reasons to act because of our practical identities (such as\none’s identity as a father, or lecturer, or Englishman), not\nbecause acts have reasons attached to them in themselves. Once again,\nrealists might demur, claiming that some actions are rational things to\ndo, because some things have value as such: so, perhaps knowledge is\nvaluable in itself, thereby making it rational to seek it. But let us\nleave such worries aside and assume with Korsgaard that nothing is\nobjectively rational for us to do. \nThe third step asks how a practical identity can make something into a\nreason for an agent: how can the fact that I am a father make it\nrational for me to buy my daughter this toy? The thought here is that\nit can only do so if you see value in that identity. Korsgaard stresses\nthis when she writes: \n\nSo, being a father, whether contingently or essentially, gives one\nno reason to be a caring or devoted father of a sort that would have\ngood reason to buy a daughter a gift; rather, valuing one’s\nfatherhood does this. \nBut (moving on to step (4)), how can I see my particular practical\nidentity as valuable? I think Korsgaard’s position here is that I\ncannot see any value in any particular practical identity as such: for,\nto do so would mean being committed to realism, to thinking that being\na father, an Englishman, a university lecturer or whatever matters as\nsuch; or (in a way that is in the end equally realist), it matters\nbecause of the intrinsically valuable things it leads you to do. But,\nKorsgaard takes such realist positions to be problematic, and so thinks\nthis will not do as an answer. \nSo suppose we allow that no particular practical identity can be seen\nto have value in itself; Korsgaard then offers as the only remaining\nexplanation of its value to the agent that has that identity, that such\nidentities have the general capacity of enabling the agent to live a\nlife containing reasons: because I have whatever particular practical\nidentities I do (father, Englishman, university lecturer…), I\ncan then find things to be valuable and act rationally accordingly, in\na way that gives me unity as a\nsubject. \n\nBut then (step (5)), to think that this makes having some sort of\nparticular practical identity important, you must think that it matters\nthat your life have the sort of rational structure that having such\nidentities provides; but (step (6)), to see that as mattering, you must\nsee value in your leading a rationally structured life. And then,\nfinally, to see value in your leading such a life, you must see your\nrational nature as valuable, which is to value your humanity. \nDoes this Korsgaardian argument avoid the pitfalls of the Kantian one\ndiscussed earlier? I think it avoids the problem of self-conceit,\nbecause it does seem that what you end up valuing is not yourself\nsimply as such, but yourself qua rational agent. And I think as I have\npresented it, it avoids the problem of the Satanic parallel, because\nall it shows is that Satan must value his rational nature, not his\ndevilishness. \nFor both these problems to be avoided, however, it is important to run\nthe argument as outlined above, not as it is sometimes presented by\nKorsgaard, which is via the notion of need (cf. Korsgaard 1996: 121 and\n125). This would follow the same premises as before for (1)–(5), and\nthen go as follows: \n\nThe difficulty with (6*)–(8*), I think, is that (8*) does not\nstipulate what it is about yourself that you are required to value, so\nthat this could be my sheer particularity (self-conceit), or if I am\nnot in fact human, my non-human nature (Satan). This is because (6*)\njust identifies a need, and says that this need could not be important\nunless the agent who has the need were seen to be valuable somehow\n– whereas the previous argument narrows value down to rational\nagency, and so rules out both self-conceit and devilishness. \n\nWe have therefore reconstructed that part of Korsgaard’s\nstrategy which offers an argument to the effect that you must value\nyour humanity, as a transcendental argument. It turns out that if it is\nto be made plausible in this way, a lot depends on accepting\nKorsgaard’s arguments against realism; but then, as we have seen,\nmany have always suspected that some commitment to anti-realism is\nrequired to make a transcendental argument convincing. A further worry\nwhen it comes to external world skepticism, as we discussed above\n(§3), is that this commitment can appear to make the argument\nredundant, because anti-realism appears sufficient as a response to\nskepticism on its own. However, in this ethical case, this worry is\nperhaps less of a concern, because a skeptic could endorse an\nanti-realist position in metaethics, without accepting that they or\nothers have value as a matter of their normative ethics, so that there\nis still work left for the transcendental argument to do. To this\nextent, therefore, it is not surprising that Korsgaard’s claims\nhave given further impetus to the debate concerning what transcendental\narguments are, and what they can contribute. (For further discussion of\nKorsgaard’s position as an interpretation of Kant, see Wood 1999:\n125–32 and Timmermann 2006; and for further discussion, see\nSkorupski 1998, Skidmore 2002, Enoch 2006, Stern 2011, Watts and Stern forthcoming.) \n\nWe have looked in some depth at the role of transcendental arguments\nthat have been given in philosophy, not only in refuting the\nepistemological skeptic but also in ethics. As we have seen, such\narguments clearly face challenges, both in their details but also at a\nmore general level, concerning how much they can ever hope to achieve.\nHowever, while these challenges are certainly significant, it would be\nwrong to exaggerate them: for, as we have also seen, the range of\npotential uses for such arguments is wide, while it seems that their\nintriguing power, as well as their alluring promise, will mean that\nphilosophers will continue to be drawn to them. As a result, therefore,\nit seems unlikely that those engaged in the subject will ever cease to\nfeel that ‘tenderness for transcendental arguments’\n(Strawson 1985: 21) instilled in them by Kant and others.","contact.mail":"r.stern@sheffield.ac.uk","contact.domain":"sheffield.ac.uk"}]
