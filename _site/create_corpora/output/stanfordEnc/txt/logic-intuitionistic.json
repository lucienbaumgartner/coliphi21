E. J. Brouwer\n beginning in his [1907] and [1908]. Because these principles also\nhold for Russian recursive mathematics and the constructive analysis\nof E. Bishop and his followers, intuitionistic logic may be considered\nthe logical basis of\n constructive mathematics.\n Although intuitionistic analysis conflicts with classical analysis,\nintuitionistic Heyting arithmetic is a subsystem of classical Peano\narithmetic. It follows that intuitionistic propositional logic is a\nproper subsystem of classical propositional logic, and pure\nintuitionistic predicate logic is a proper subsystem of pure classical\npredicate logic. \n\n\nPhilosophically,\n intuitionism\n differs from\n logicism\n by treating logic as a part of mathematics rather than as the\nfoundation of mathematics; from\n finitism\n by allowing constructive reasoning about uncountable structures\n(e.g., monotone bar induction on the tree of potentially infinite\nsequences of natural numbers); and from\n Platonism\n by viewing mathematical objects as mental constructs with no\nindependent ideal existence. Hilbert’s\n formalist program,\n to justify classical mathematics by reducing it to a formal system\nwhose consistency should be established by finitistic (hence\nconstructive) means, was the most powerful contemporary rival to\nBrouwer’s developing intuitionism. In his 1912 essay\nIntuitionism and Formalism Brouwer correctly predicted that\nany attempt to prove the consistency of complete induction on the\nnatural numbers would lead to a vicious circle. \n\n\nBrouwer rejected\n formalism\n per se but admitted the potential usefulness of formulating\ngeneral logical principles expressing intuitionistically correct\nconstructions, such as modus ponens. Formal systems for\nintuitionistic propositional and predicate logic and arithmetic were\nfully developed by Heyting [1930], Gentzen [1935] and Kleene [1952].\nGödel [1933] proved the equiconsistency of intuitionistic and\nclassical theories. Beth [1956] and Kripke [1965] provided semantics\nwith respect to which intuitionistic logic is correct and complete,\nalthough the completeness proofs for intuitionistic predicate logic\nrequire some classical reasoning. \n\nIntuitionistic logic can be succinctly described as classical logic\nwithout the Aristotelian law of excluded middle:  \nor the classical law of double negation elimination:  \nbut with the law of contradiction:  \nand ex falso sequitur quodlibet:  \nBrouwer [1908] observed that LEM was abstracted from finite\nsituations, then extended without justification to statements about\ninfinite collections. For example, let \\(x, y\\) range over the natural\nnumbers \\(0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\) and let \\(B(y)\\) abbreviate\n\\((\\primepred(y) \\oldand \\primepred(y+2))\\), where \\(\\primepred(y)\\)\nexpresses “\\(y\\) is a prime number.” Then \\(\\forall y\n(B(y) \\vee \\neg B(y))\\) holds intuitionistically as well as\nclassically, because in order to determine whether or not a natural\nnumber is prime we need only check whether or not it has a divisor\nstrictly between itself and 1.  \nBut if \\(A(x)\\) abbreviates \\(\\exists y(y\\gt x \\oldand B(y))\\), then\nin order to assert \\(\\forall x (A(x) \\vee \\neg A(x))\\)\nintuitionistically we would need an effective (cf.\n the Church-Turing thesis)\n method to determine whether or not there is a pair of twin primes\nlarger than an arbitrary natural number \\(x\\), and so far no such\nmethod is known. An obvious semi-effective method is to list\nthe prime number pairs using a refinement of Eratosthenes’ sieve\n(generating the natural numbers one by one and striking out every\nnumber \\(y\\) which fails to satisfy \\(B(y)\\)), and if there is a pair\nof twin primes larger than \\(x\\) this method will eventually find the\nfirst one. However, \\(\\forall x A(x)\\) expresses the Twin Primes\nConjecture, which has not yet been proved or disproved, so in the\npresent state of our knowledge we can assert neither \\(\\forall x (A(x)\n\\vee \\neg A(x))\\) nor \\(\\forall x A(x) \\vee \\neg \\forall x A(x)\\). \nOne may object that these examples depend on the fact that the Twin\nPrimes Conjecture has not yet been settled. A number of\nBrouwer’s original “counterexamples” depended on\nproblems (such as Fermat’s Last Theorem) which have since been\nsolved. But to Brouwer the general LEM was equivalent to the a\npriori assumption that every mathematical problem has a\nsolution—an assumption he rejected, anticipating\nGödel’s incompleteness theorem by a quarter of a century.\n \nThe rejection of LEM has far-reaching consequences. On the one hand,\n \nOn the other hand, \nFormalized intuitionistic logic is naturally motivated by the informal\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov explanation of intuitionistic truth,\noutlined in the entries on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics\n and\n the development of intuitionistic logic.\n The constructive independence of the logical operations \\(\\oldand,\n\\vee , \\rightarrow , \\neg , \\forall , \\exists\\) contrasts with the\nclassical situation, where e.g., \\(A \\vee B\\) is equivalent to\n\\(\\neg(\\neg A \\oldand \\neg B)\\), and \\(\\exists xA(x)\\) is equivalent\nto \\(\\neg \\forall x \\neg A(x)\\). From the B-H-K viewpoint, a sentence\nof the form \\(A \\vee B\\) asserts that either a proof of \\(A\\), or a\nproof of \\(B\\), has been constructed; while \\(\\neg(\\neg A \\oldand \\neg\nB)\\) asserts that an algorithm has been constructed which would\neffectively convert any pair of constructions proving \\(\\neg A\\) and\n\\(\\neg B\\) respectively, into a proof of a known contradiction. \nFollowing is a Hilbert-style formalism \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) from\nKleene [1952] (cf. Troelstra and van Dalen [1988]) for intuitionistic\nfirst-order predicate logic. The language \\(L\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) has predicate letters \\(P, Q(.), \\ldots\\) of\nall arities and individual variables \\(x, y, z, \\ldots\\) (with or\nwithout subscripts \\(1, 2, \\ldots\\)), as well as symbols \\(\\oldand,\n\\vee , \\rightarrow , \\neg , \\forall , \\exists\\) for the logical\nconnectives and quantifiers, and parentheses (, ). The atomic\n(or prime) formulas of \\(L\\) are expressions such as\n\\(P, Q(x), R(x, y, x)\\) where \\(P, Q({.}), R({.}{.}{.})\\) are\n\\(0\\)-ary, \\(1\\)-ary and \\(3\\)-ary predicate letters respectively;\nthat is, the result of filling each blank in a predicate letter by an\nindividual variable symbol is a prime formula. The (well-formed)\nformulas of \\(L\\) are defined inductively as follows. \nIn general, we use \\(A, B, C\\) as metavariables for well-formed\nformulas and \\(x, y, z\\) as metavariables for individual variables.\nAnticipating applications (for example to intuitionistic arithmetic)\nwe use \\(s, t\\) as metavariables for terms; in the case of\npure predicate logic, terms are simply individual variables. An\noccurrence of a variable \\(x\\) in a formula \\(A\\) is bound if\nit is within the scope of a quantifier \\(\\forall x\\) or \\(\\exists x\\),\notherwise free. Intuitionistically as classically, \\((A\n\\leftrightarrow B)\\) abbreviates \\(((A \\rightarrow B) \\oldand (B\n\\rightarrow A))\\), and parentheses will be omitted when this causes no\nconfusion. \nThere are three rules of inference: \nModus Ponens\n\nFrom \\(A\\) and \\(A \\rightarrow B\\), conclude \\(B\\).  \n\\(\\forall\\)-Introduction\n\nFrom \\(C \\rightarrow A(x)\\), where \\(x\\) is a variable which does not\noccur free in \\(C\\), conclude \\(C \\rightarrow \\forall x A(x)\\).  \n\\(\\exists\\)-Elimination\n\nFrom \\(A(x) \\rightarrow C\\), where \\(x\\) is a variable which does not\noccur free in \\(C\\), conclude \\(\\exists x A(x) \\rightarrow C\\).  \nThe axioms are all formulas of the following forms, where in the last\ntwo schemas the subformula \\(A(t)\\) is the result of substituting an\noccurrence of the term \\(t\\) for every free occurrence of \\(x\\) in\n\\(A(x)\\), and no variable free in \\(t\\) becomes bound in \\(A(t)\\) as a\nresult of the substitution. \nA proof is any finite sequence of formulas, each of which is\nan axiom or an immediate consequence, by a rule of inference, of (one\nor two) preceding formulas of the sequence. Any proof is said to\nprove its last formula, which is called a theorem or\nprovable formula of first-order intuitionistic predicate\nlogic. A derivation of a formula \\(E\\) from a\ncollection \\(F\\) of assumptions is any sequence of formulas,\neach of which belongs to \\(F\\) or is an axiom or an immediate\nconsequence, by a rule of inference, of preceding formulas of the\nsequence, such that \\(E\\) is the last formula of the sequence. If such\na derivation exists, we say \\(E\\) is derivable from \\(F\\).\n \nIntuitionistic propositional logic \\(\\mathbf{H–IPC}\\) is the\nsubsystem of \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) which results when the language\nis restricted to formulas built from proposition letters \\(P, Q,\nR,\\ldots\\) using the propositional connectives \\(\\oldand, \\vee ,\n\\rightarrow\\) and \\(\\neg\\), and only the propositional postulates are\nused. Thus the last two rules of inference and the last two axiom\nschemas are absent from the propositional subsystem.  \nIf, in the given list of axiom schemas for intuitionistic\npropositional or first-order predicate logic, the law expressing\nex falso sequitur quodlibet: \nis replaced by the classical law of double negation elimination\nDNE: \n(or, equivalently, if the intuitionistic law of negation\nintroduction: \nis replaced by LEM), a formal system \\(\\mathbf{H–CPC}\\) for\nclassical propositional logic or \\(\\mathbf{H–CQC}\\) for\nclassical predicate logic results. Since ex falso and the law\nof contradiction are classical theorems, intuitionistic logic is\ncontained in classical logic. In a sense, classical logic is also\ncontained in intuitionistic logic; see Section 4.1 below. \nIt is important to note that while LEM and DNE are equivalent as\nschemas over \\(\\mathbf{H–IPC}\\), the\nimplication \nis not a theorem schema of \\(\\mathbf{H–IPC}\\). For theories\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) based on intuitionistic logic, if \\(E\\) is an arbitrary\nformula of \\(L(\\mathbf{T})\\) then by definition: \n\\(E\\) is decidable in \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) if and only if\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) proves \\(E \\vee \\neg E\\). \n\\(E\\) is stable in \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) if and only if\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) proves \\(\\neg \\neg E \\rightarrow E\\). \n\\(E\\) is testable in \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) if and only if\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) proves \\(\\neg E \\vee \\neg \\neg E\\). \nDecidability implies stability, but not conversely. The conjunction of\nstability and testability is equivalent to decidability. Brouwer\nhimself proved that “absurdity of absurdity of absurdity is\nequivalent to absurdity” (Brouwer [1923C]), so every formula of\nthe form \\(\\neg A\\) is stable; but in \\(\\mathbf{H–IPC}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) prime formulas and their negations are\nundecidable, as shown in Section 5.1 below.  \nThe Hilbert-style system \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) is useful for\nmetamathematical investigations of intuitionistic logic, but its\nforced linearization of deductions and its preference for axioms over\nrules make it an awkward instrument for establishing derivability. A\nnatural deduction system \\(\\mathbf{N–IQC}\\) for intuitionistic\npredicate logic results from the deductive system \\(\\mathbf{D}\\),\npresented in Section 3 of the entry on\n classical logic\n in this Encyclopedia, by omitting the symbol and rules for identity,\nand replacing the classical rule (DNE) of double negation elimination\nby the intuitionistic negation elimination rule expressing ex\nfalso:  \nThe keys to proving that \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) is equivalent to\n\\(\\mathbf{N–IQC}\\) are modus ponens and its converse,\nthe: \nDeduction Theorem\n\nIf \\(B\\) is derivable from \\(A\\) and possibly other formulas \\(F\\),\nwith all variables free in \\(A\\) held constant in the derivation (that\nis, without using the second or third rule of inference on any\nvariable \\(x\\) occurring free in \\(A\\), unless the assumption \\(A\\)\ndoes not occur in the derivation before the inference in question),\nthen \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is derivable from \\(F\\).  \nThis fundamental result, roughly expressing the rule \\((\\rightarrow\nI)\\) of \\(\\mathbf{I}\\), can be proved for \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) by\ninduction on the definition of a derivation. The other rules of\n\\(\\mathbf{I}\\) hold for \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) essentially by\nmodus ponens, which corresponds to \\((\\rightarrow E)\\) in\n\\(\\mathbf{N–IQC}\\); and all the axioms of\n\\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) are provable in \\(\\mathbf{N–IQC}\\). \nTo illustrate the usefulness of the Deduction Theorem, consider the\n(apparently trivial) theorem schema \\((A \\rightarrow A)\\). A correct\nproof in \\(\\mathbf{H–IPC}\\) takes five lines: \nwhere 1, 2 and 4 are axioms and 3, 5 come from earlier lines by\nmodus ponens. However, \\(A\\) is derivable from \\(A\\) (as\nassumption) in one obvious step, so the Deduction Theorem allows us to\nconclude that a proof of \\(A \\rightarrow A\\) exists. (In fact, the\nformal proof of \\(A \\rightarrow A\\) just presented is part of the\nconstructive proof of the Deduction Theorem!) \nIt is important to note that, in the definition of a derivation from\nassumptions in \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\), the assumption formulas are\ntreated as if all their free variables were universally quantified, so\nthat \\(\\forall x A(x)\\) is derivable from the hypothesis \\(A(x)\\).\nHowever, the variable \\(x\\) will be varied (not held\nconstant) in that derivation, by use of the rule of\n\\(\\forall\\)-introduction; and so the Deduction Theorem cannot be used\nto conclude (falsely) that \\(A(x) \\rightarrow \\forall x A(x)\\) (and\nhence, by \\(\\exists\\)-elimination, \\(\\exists x A(x) \\rightarrow\n\\forall x A(x))\\) are provable in \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\). As an\nexample of a correct use of the Deduction Theorem for predicate logic,\nconsider the implication \\(\\exists x A(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\forall\nx\\neg A(x)\\). To show this is provable in \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\), we\nfirst derive \\(\\neg \\forall x\\neg A(x)\\) from \\(A(x)\\) with all free\nvariables held constant: \nHere 1, 2 and 5 are axioms; 4 comes from 2 and 3 by modus\nponens; and 6 and 7 come from earlier lines by modus\nponens; so no variables have been varied. The Deduction Theorem\ntells us there is a proof \\(P\\) in \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) of \\(A(x)\n\\rightarrow \\neg \\forall\\)x\\(\\neg A(x)\\), and one application of\n\\(\\exists\\)-elimination converts \\(P\\) into a proof of\n\\(\\exists x A(x) \\rightarrow \\neg \\forall x\\neg A(x)\\). The converse\nis not provable in \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\), as shown in Section 5.1\nbelow. \nOther important alternatives to \\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{N–IQC}\\) are the various sequent calculi for\nintuitionistic propositional and predicate logic. The first such\ncalculus was defined by Gentzen [1934–5], cf. Kleene [1952].\nSequent systems, which prove exactly the same formulas as\n\\(\\mathbf{H–IQC}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{N–IQC}\\), keep track\nexplicitly of all assumptions and conclusions at each step of a proof,\nreplacing modus ponens (which eliminates an intermediate\nformula) by a cut rule (which can be shown to be an\nadmissible rule (cf. Section 4.2) for the subsystem remaining when it\nis omitted). \nWhen the details of the formalism are not important, from now on we\nfollow Troelstra and van Dalen [1988] in letting\n“\\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\)” or “\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\)” refer\nto any formal system for intuitionistic predicate or propositional\nlogic respectively, and similarly “\\(\\mathbf{CQC}\\)” and\n“\\(\\mathbf{CPC}\\)” for classical predicate and\npropositional logic. \nBoth \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) satisfy interpolation\ntheorems, e.g.: If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are propositional formulas\nhaving at least one proposition letter in common, and if \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) is provable in \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), then there is a\nformula \\(C\\), containing only proposition letters which occur in both\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), such that both \\(A \\rightarrow C\\) and \\(C\n\\rightarrow B\\) are provable. These topics are treated in Kleene\n[1952] and Troelstra and Schwichtenberg [2000]. \nWhile identity can of course be added to intuitionistic logic, for\napplications (e.g., to arithmetic) the equality symbol is generally\ntreated as a distinguished predicate constant satisfying the axioms\nfor an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity)\nand additional nonlogical axioms (e.g., the primitive recursive\ndefinitions of addition and multiplication). Identity is decidable,\nintuitionistically as well as classically, but intuitionistic\nextensional equality is not always decidable; see the discussion of\nBrouwer’s continuity axioms in Section 3 of the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics. \nIntuitionistic (Heyting) arithmetic \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) and classical\n(Peano) arithmetic \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) share the same first-order language\nand the same non-logical axioms; only the logic is different. In\naddition to the logical connectives, quantifiers and parentheses and\nthe individual variables \\(x, y, z,\\ldots\\) (also used as\nmetavariables), the language \\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) of arithmetic has a\nbinary predicate symbol \\(=\\), individual constant \\(0\\), unary\nfunction constant \\(S\\), and finitely or countably infinitely many\nadditional constants for primitive recursive functions including\naddition and multiplication; the precise choice is a matter of taste\nand convenience. Terms are built from variables and \\(0\\)\nusing the function constants; in particular, each natural number \\(n\\)\nis expressed in the language by the numeral \\(\\mathbf{n}\\)\nobtained by applying \\(S\\) \\(n\\) times to \\(0\\) (e.g., \\(S(S(0))\\) is\nthe numeral for \\(2\\)). Prime formulas are of the form \\((s =\nt)\\) where \\(s, t\\) are terms, and compound formulas are\nobtained from these as usual.  \nThe logical axioms and rules of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) are those of\nfirst-order intuitionistic predicate logic \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\). The\nnonlogical axioms include the reflexive, symmetric and transitive\nproperties of \\(=\\): \n\n\\[\n\\forall x (x = x),\\] \n\n \n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\forall y (x = y \\rightarrow y = x),\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z ((x = y \\oldand y = z) \\rightarrow x = z);\\] \n\n the axiom\ncharacterizing \\(0\\) as the least natural number: \nthe axiom characterizing \\(S\\) as a one-to-one function: \nthe extensional equality axiom for \\(S\\):  \nthe primitive recursive defining equations for each function constant,\nin particular for addition: \n\n\\[\n\\forall x (x + 0 = x),\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\forall y (x + S(y) = S(x + y));\\]\n\n and\nmultiplication: \n\n\\[\n\\forall x (x \\cdot 0 = 0),\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\forall y (x \\cdot S(y) = (x \\cdot y) + x);\\] \n\n and the (universal closure\nof the) schema of mathematical induction, for arbitrary formulas\n\\(A(x)\\):  \nExtensional equality axioms for all function constants are derivable\nby mathematical induction from the equality axiom for \\(S\\) and the\nprimitive recursive function axioms.  \nThe natural order relation \\(x \\lt y\\) can be defined in\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) by \\(\\exists z(S(z) + x = y)\\), or by the\nquantifier-free formula \\(S(x) \\dot{-} y = 0\\) if the symbol and\nprimitive recursive defining equations for predecessor : \n\n\\[\nPd(0) = 0,\\]\n\n\\[\n\\forall x (Pd(S(x)) = x)\\]\n\n and cutoff subtraction : \n\n\\[\n\\forall x (x \\dot{-} 0 = 0),\\]\n\n \n\n\\[\n\\forall x (x \\dot{-} S(y) = Pd(x \\dot{-} y))\\]\n\n are\npresent in the formalism. \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) proves the comparative\nlaw \nand an intuitionistic form of the least number principle, for\narbitrary formulas \\(A(x)\\): \nThe hypothesis is needed because not all arithmetical formulas are\ndecidable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). However, \\(\\forall x\\forall y(x = y \\vee\n\\neg(x = y))\\) can be proved directly by mathematical induction, and\nso  \nPrime formulas (and hence all quantifier-free formulas) are\ndecidable and stable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). \nIf \\(A(x)\\) is decidable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), then by induction on\n\\(x\\) so are \\(\\forall y (y \\lt x \\rightarrow A(y))\\) and \\(\\exists y\n(y \\lt x \\oldand A(y))\\). Hence \nFormulas in which all quantifiers are bounded are decidable\nand stable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). \nThe collection \\(\\Delta_0\\) of arithmetical formulas in which all\nquantifiers are bounded is the lowest level of a classical\narithmetical hierarchy based on the pattern of alternations of\nquantifiers in a prenex formula. In \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) not every formula\nhas a prenex form, but Burr [2004] discovered a simple intuitionistic\narithmetical hierarchy corresponding level by level to the classical.\nFor the purposes of the next two definitions only, \\(\\forall x\\)\ndenotes a block of finitely many universal number quantifiers, and\nsimilarly \\(\\exists x\\) denotes a block of finitely many existential\nnumber quantifiers. With these conventions, Burr’s classes\n\\(\\Phi_n\\) and \\(\\Psi_n\\) are defined by: \nThe corresponding classical prenex classes are defined more simply:\n \nPeano arithmetic \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) comes from Heyting arithmetic\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) by adding LEM or \\(\\neg \\neg A \\rightarrow A\\) to the\nlist of logical axioms, i.e., by using classical instead of\nintuitionistic logic. The following results hold even in the fragments\nof \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) with the induction schema\nrestricted to \\(\\Delta_0\\) formulas. \n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) are proof-theoretically\nequivalent, as will be shown in Section 4. Each is capable of\n(numeralwise) expressing its own proof predicate. By\nGödel’s famous Incompleteness Theorem, if \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\)\nis consistent then neither \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) nor \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) can\nprove its own consistency.  \nA fundamental fact about intuitionistic logic is that it has the same\nconsistency strength as classical logic. For propositional logic this\nwas first proved by Glivenko [1929].  \nGlivenko’s Theorem\n\nAn arbitrary propositional formula \\(A\\) is classically provable, if\nand only if \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) is intuitionistically provable. \nGlivenko’s Theorem does not extend to predicate logic, although\nan arbitrary predicate formula \\(A\\) is classically provable if and\nonly if \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) is provable in intuitionistic predicate logic\nplus the “double negation shift” schema. \nThe more sophisticated negative translation of\nclassical into intuitionistic theories, due independently to\nGödel and Gentzen, associates with each formula \\(A\\) of the\nlanguage \\(L\\) another formula \\(g(A)\\) (with no \\(\\vee\\) or\n\\(\\exists)\\), such that \nThe proofs are straightforward from the following inductive definition\nof \\(g(A)\\) (using Gentzen’s direct translation of implication,\nrather than Gödel’s in terms of \\(\\neg\\) and\n\\(\\oldand\\)): \nFor each formula \\(A\\), \\(g(A)\\) is provable intuitionistically if and\nonly if \\(A\\) is provable classically. In particular, if \\(B \\oldand\n\\neg B\\) were classically provable for some formula \\(B\\), then \\(g(B)\n\\oldand \\neg g(B)\\) (which is \\(g(B \\oldand \\neg B))\\) would in turn\nbe provable intuitionistically. Hence \nThe negative translation of classical into intuitionistic number\ntheory is even simpler, since prime formulas of intuitionistic\narithmetic are stable. Thus \\(g(s=t)\\) can be taken to be \\(s=t\\), and\nthe other clauses are unchanged. The negative translation of any\ninstance of mathematical induction is another instance of mathematical\ninduction, and the other nonlogical axioms of arithmetic are their own\nnegative translations, so \nGödel [1933e] interpreted these results as showing that\nintuitionistic logic and arithmetic are richer than classical\nlogic and arithmetic, because the intuitionistic theory distinguishes\nformulas which are classically equivalent, and has the same\n consistency strength\n as the classical theory. In particular, Gödel’s\nincompleteness theorems apply to \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) as well as to\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\). \nDirect attempts to extend the negative interpretation to analysis fail\nbecause the negative translation of the countable axiom of choice is\nnot a theorem of intuitionistic analysis. However, it is consistent\nwith intuitionistic analysis, including Brouwer’s controversial\ncontinuity principle, by the functional version of Kleene’s\nrecursive realizability (cf. Section 6.2 below). It follows that\nintuitionistic mathematics, which can only be expressed by using all\nthe standard logical connectives and quantifiers, is consistent with a\nfaithful translation of classical mathematics avoiding \\(\\vee\\) and\n\\(\\exists\\). \nThis is important because Brouwer’s intuitionistic analysis is\ninconsistent with LEM. However, if \\(A\\) is any negative\nformula (without \\(\\vee\\) or \\(\\exists\\)) then \\(\\neg \\neg A\n\\rightarrow A\\) is provable using intuitionistic logic. A\nreconciliation of intuitionistic and classical analysis along these\nlines, inspired by Kripke’s notion of choice sequence, is\nsuggested in Moschovakis [2017]. \nGödel [1932] observed that intuitionistic propositional logic has\nthe disjunction property: \nGentzen [1935] established the disjunction property for closed\nformulas of intuitionistic predicate logic. From this it follows that\nif intuitionistic logic is consistent, then \\(P \\vee \\neg P\\) is not a\ntheorem if \\(P\\) is an atomic formula. Kleene [1945, 1952] proved that\nintuitionistic first-order number theory also has the related (cf.\nFriedman [1975]) existence property: \nThe disjunction and existence properties are special cases of a\ngeneral phenomenon peculiar to nonclassical theories. The\nadmissible rules of a theory are the rules under which the\ntheory is closed. For example, Harrop [1960] observed that the rule\n \nIf \\(\\neg A \\rightarrow (B \\vee C)\\) is a theorem, so is \\((\\neg A\n\\rightarrow B) \\vee(\\neg A \\rightarrow C)\\)  \nis admissible for intuitionistic propositional logic \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\)\nbecause if \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are any formulas such that \\(\\neg A\n\\rightarrow(B \\vee C)\\) is provable in \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), then also\n\\((\\neg A \\rightarrow B) \\vee(\\neg A \\rightarrow C)\\) is provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\). Harrop’s rule is not derivable in\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) because \\((\\neg A \\rightarrow(B \\vee C)) \\rightarrow\n(\\neg A \\rightarrow B) \\vee (\\neg A \\rightarrow C)\\) is not\nintuitionistically provable. Another important example of an\nadmissible nonderivable rule of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is Mints’s\nrule:  \nIf \\((A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow (A \\vee C)\\) is a theorem, so is\n\\(((A \\rightarrow B) \\rightarrow A) \\vee ((A \\rightarrow B)\n\\rightarrow C)\\).  \nThe two-valued truth table interpretation of classical propositional\nlogic \\(\\mathbf{CPC}\\) gives rise to a simple proof that every\nadmissible rule of \\(\\mathbf{CPC}\\) is derivable: otherwise, some\nassignment to \\(A\\), \\(B\\), etc. would make the hypothesis true and\nthe conclusion false, and by substituting e.g. \\(P \\rightarrow P\\) for\nthe letters assigned “true” and \\(P \\oldand \\neg P\\) for\nthose assigned “false” one would have a provable\nhypothesis and unprovable conclusion. The fact that the intuitionistic\nsituation is more interesting leads to many natural questions, some of\nwhich have recently been answered. \nBy generalizing Mints’s Rule, Visser and de Jongh identified a\nrecursively enumerable sequence of successively stronger admissible\nrules (“Visser’s rules”) which, they conjectured,\nformed a basis for the admissible rules of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\)\nin the sense that every admissible rule is derivable from the\ndisjunction property and one of the rules of the sequence. Building on\nwork of Ghilardi [1999], Iemhoff [2001] succeeded in proving their\nconjecture. Rybakov [1997] proved that the collection of all\nadmissible rules of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is decidable but has no finite\nbasis. Visser [2002] showed that his rules are also the admissible\npropositional rules of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), and of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\)\nextended by Markov’s Principle MP (defined in Section 5.2\nbelow). More recently, Jerabek [2008] found an independent basis for\nthe admissible rules of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), with the property that no\nrule in the basis derives another. \nMuch less is known about the admissible rules of intuitionistic\npredicate logic. Pure \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\), without individual or\npredicate constants, has the following remarkable admissible rule for\n\\(A(x)\\) with no variables free but \\(x\\): \nIf \\(\\exists x A(x)\\) is a theorem, so is \\(\\forall x A(x)\\).  \nNot every admissible predicate rule of \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) is admissible\nfor all formal systems based on \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\); for example,\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) evidently violates the rule just stated. Visser proved\nin [1999] that the property of being an admissible predicate rule of\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) is \\(\\Pi_2\\) complete, and in [2002] that\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) MP has the same predicate admissible rules as\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). Plisko [1992] proved that the predicate\nlogic of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) MP (the set of sentences in the\nlanguage of \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) all of whose uniform substitution\ninstances in the language of arithmetic are provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) MP) is \\(\\Pi_2\\) complete; Visser [2006]\nextended this result to some constructively interesting consistent\nextensions of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) which are not contained in\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\). \nWhile they have not been completely classified, the admissible rules\nof intuitionistic predicate logic are known to include\nMarkov’s Rule for decidable predicates: \nIf \\(\\forall x(A(x) \\vee \\neg A(x)) \\oldand \\neg \\forall x\\neg A(x)\\)\nis a theorem, so is \\(\\exists x A(x)\\).  \nand the following Independence-of-Premise Rule (where\n\\(y\\) is assumed not to occur free in \\(A(x))\\): \nIf \\(\\forall x(A(x) \\vee \\neg A(x)) \\oldand (\\forall x A(x)\n\\rightarrow \\exists y B(y))\\) is a theorem, so is \\(\\exists y (\\forall\nx A(x) \\rightarrow B(y))\\).  \nBoth rules are also admissible for \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). The corresponding\nimplications (MP and IP respectively), which are not provable\nintuitionistically, are verified by Gödel’s\n“Dialectica” interpretation of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) (cf.\nSection 6.3 below). So is the implication (CT) corresponding to one of\nthe most interesting admissible rules of Heyting arithmetic, let us\ncall it the Church-Kleene Rule:  \nIf \\(\\forall x \\exists y A(x, y)\\) is a closed theorem of\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) then there is a number \\(n\\) such that, provably in\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), the partial recursive function with Gödel number\n\\(n\\) is total and maps each \\(x\\) to a \\(y\\) satisfying \\(A(x, y)\\)\n(and moreover \\(A(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y})\\) is provable, where\n\\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is the numeral for the natural number \\(x\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the numeral for \\(y)\\).  \nCombining Markov’s Rule with the negative translation gives the\nresult that classical and intuitionistic arithmetic prove the same\nformulas of the form \\(\\forall x \\exists y A(x, y)\\) where \\(A(x, y)\\)\nis quantifier-free. In general, if \\(A(x, y)\\) is provably decidable\nin \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) and if \\(\\forall x \\exists y A(x, y)\\) is a closed\ntheorem of classical arithmetic \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\), the\nconclusion of the Church-Kleene Rule holds even in\nintuitionistic arithmetic. For if \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) proves\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y (A(x,y) \\vee \\neg A(x,y))\\) then by the\nChurch-Kleene Rule the characteristic function of \\(A(x,y)\\) has a\nGödel number \\(m\\), provably in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\); so\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) proves \\(\\forall x \\exists y A(x,y) \\leftrightarrow\n\\forall x \\exists y \\exists z B(\\mathbf{m},x,y,z)\\) where \\(B\\) is\nquantifier-free, and the adjacent existential quantifiers can be\ncontracted in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). It follows that \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) have the same provably recursive functions. \nHere is a proof that the rule “If \\(\\forall x (A \\vee B(x))\\) is\na theorem, so is \\(A \\vee \\forall x B(x)\\)” (where \\(x\\) is not\nfree in \\(A)\\) is not admissible for \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), if\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) is consistent. Gödel numbering provides a\nquantifier-free formula \\(G(x)\\) which (numeralwise) expresses the\npredicate “\\(x\\) is the code of a proof in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) of\n\\((0 = 1)\\).” By intuitionistic logic with the decidability of\nquantifier-free arithmetical formulas, \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) proves\n\\(\\forall x(\\exists y G(y) \\vee \\neg G(x))\\). However, if\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) proved \\(\\exists yG(y) \\vee \\forall x\\neg G(x)\\) then\nby the disjunction property, \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) must prove either\n\\(\\exists yG(y)\\) or \\(\\forall x\\neg G(x)\\). The first case is\nimpossible, by the existence property with the consistency assumption\nand the fact that \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) proves all true quantifier-free\nsentences. But the second case is also impossible, by\nGödel’s second incompleteness theorem, since \\(\\forall\nx\\neg G(x)\\) expresses the consistency of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). \nIntuitionistic systems have inspired a variety of interpretations,\nincluding Beth’s tableaux, Rasiowa and Sikorski’s\ntopological models, Heyting algebras, formulas-as-types,\nKleene’s recursive realizabilities, the Kleene and Aczel\nslashes, and models based on sheafs and topoi. Of all these\ninterpretations Kripke’s [1965] possible-world semantics, with\nrespect to which intuitionistic predicate logic is complete and\nconsistent, most resembles classical model theory. Recursive\nrealizability interpretations, on the other hand, attempt to\neffectively implement the B-H-K explanation of intuitionistic\ntruth. \nA Kripke structure \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) for \\(L\\) consists of a\npartially ordered set \\(K\\) of nodes and a domain\nfunction D assigning to each node \\(k\\) in \\(K\\) an inhabited set\n\\(D(k)\\), such that if \\(k \\le k'\\), then \\(D(k) \\subseteq D(k')\\). In\naddition \\(\\mathbf{K}\\) has a forcing relation determined as\nfollows. \nFor each node \\(k\\) let \\(L(k)\\) be the language extending \\(L\\) by\nnew constants for all the elements of \\(D(k)\\). To each node \\(k\\) and\neach \\(0\\)-ary predicate letter (each proposition letter) \\(P\\),\neither assign \\(f(P, k) =\\) true or leave \\(f(P, k)\\)\nundefined, consistent with the requirement that if \\(k \\le k'\\) and\n\\(f(P, k) =\\) true then \\(f(P, k') =\\) true also.\nSay that \n\\(k\\) \\(\\vDash\\) \\(P\\) if and only if \\(f(P, k) =\\) true.\n \nTo each node \\(k\\) and each \\((n+1)\\)-ary predicate letter\n\\(Q(\\ldots)\\), assign a (possibly empty) set \\(T(Q, k)\\) of\n\\((n+1)\\)-tuples of elements of \\(D(k)\\) in such a way that if \\(k \\le\nk'\\) then \\(T(Q, k) \\subseteq T(Q, k')\\). Say that  \n\\(k\\) \\(\\vDash\\) \\(Q(d_0 ,\\ldots, d_n)\\) if and only if \\((d_0 ,\\ldots\n,d_n) \\in T(Q, k)\\).  \nNow define \\(k\\) \\(\\vDash\\) \\(E\\) (which may be read “ \\(k\\)\nforces \\(E\\) ”) for compound sentences \\(E\\) of\n\\(L(k)\\) inductively as follows:  \nAny such forcing relation is consistent: \nFor no sentence \\(A\\) and no \\(k\\) is it the case that both \\(k\\)\n\\(\\vDash\\) \\(A\\) and \\(k\\) \\(\\vDash\\) \\(\\neg A\\). \nand monotone: \nIf \\(k \\le k'\\) and \\(k\\) \\(\\vDash\\) \\(A\\) then \\(k'\\) \\(\\vDash\\)\n\\(A\\). \nKripke’s Soundness and Completeness Theorems\nestablish that a sentence of \\(L\\) is provable in intuitionistic\npredicate logic if and only if it is forced by every node of every\nKripke structure. Thus to show that \\(\\neg \\forall x \\neg P(x)\n\\rightarrow \\exists x P(x)\\) is intuitionistically unprovable, it is\nenough to consider a Kripke structure with \\(K = \\{k, k'\\},\\) \\(k \\lt\nk',\\) \\(D(k) = D(k') = \\{0\\}\\), \\(T(P, k)\\) empty but \\(T(P, k') =\n\\{0\\}\\).  And to show the converse is intuitionistically provable\n(without actually exhibiting a proof), one only needs the consistency\nand monotonicity properties of arbitrary Kripke models, with the\ndefinition of \\(\\vDash\\). \nKripke models for languages with equality may interpret \\(=\\) at each\nnode by an arbitrary equivalence relation, subject to monotonicity.\nFor applications to intuitionistic arithmetic, normal models\n(those in which equality is interpreted by identity at each node)\nsuffice because equality of natural numbers is decidable. \nPropositional Kripke semantics is particularly simple, since an\narbitrary propositional formula is intuitionistically provable if and\nonly if it is forced by the root of every Kripke model whose\nframe (the set \\(K\\) of nodes together with their partial\nordering) is a finite tree with a least element (the root).\nFor example, the Kripke model with \\(K = \\{k, k', k''\\}, k \\lt k'\\)\nand \\(k \\lt k''\\), and with \\(P\\) true only at \\(k'\\), shows that both\n\\(P \\vee \\neg P\\) and \\(\\neg P \\vee \\neg \\neg P\\) are unprovable in\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\). \nEach terminal node or leaf of a Kripke model is a classical\nmodel, because a leaf forces every formula or its negation. Only those\nproposition letters which occur in a formula \\(E\\), and only those\nnodes \\(k'\\) such that \\(k\\le k'\\), are relevant to deciding whether\nor not \\(k\\) forces \\(E\\). Such considerations allow us to associate\neffectively with each formula \\(E\\) of \\(L(\\mathbf{IPC})\\) a finite\nclass of finite Kripke structures which will include a countermodel to\n\\(E\\) if one exists. Since the class of all theorems of\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is recursively enumerable, we conclude that \n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is effectively decidable. There is a recursive\nprocedure which determines, for each propositional formula \\(E\\),\nwhether or not \\(E\\) is a theorem of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), concluding with\neither a proof of \\(E\\) or a (finite) Kripke countermodel.  \nThe decidability of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) was first obtained by Gentzen in\n1935. The undecidability of \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) follows from the\nundecidability of \\(\\mathbf{CQC}\\) by the negative interpretation. \nFamiliar non-intuitionistic logical schemata correspond to structural\nproperties of Kripke models, for example \nKripke models and Beth models (which differ from Kripke models in\ndetail, but are intuitionistically equivalent) are a powerful tool for\nestablishing properties of intuitionistic formal systems; cf.\nTroelstra and van Dalen [1988], Smorynski [1973], de Jongh and\nSmorynski [1976], Ghilardi [1999] and Iemhoff [2001], [2005]. However,\nthere is no purely intuitionistic proof that every sentence which is\nvalid in all Kripke and Beth models is provable in \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\).\nFollowing an observation by Gödel, Kreisel [1958] verified that\nthe completeness of intuitionistic predicate logic for Beth semantics\nis equivalent to Markov’s Principle MP, which Brouwer\nrejected. \nMoreover, Dyson and Kreisel [1961] showed that if \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) is\nweakly complete for Beth semantics (that is, if no unprovable\nsentence holds in every Beth model) then the following consequence of\nMP holds : \n\n\\[ \\tag{GDK} \\forall \\alpha_{B(\\alpha)} \\neg \\neg \\exists x R(\\alpha,\nx) \\rightarrow \\neg \\neg \\forall \\alpha_{B(\\alpha)} \\exists x\nR(\\alpha, x),\\]\n\n where \\(x\\) ranges over all natural numbers,\n\\(\\alpha\\) ranges over all infinite sequences of natural numbers,\n\\(B(\\alpha)\\) abbreviates \\(\\forall x (\\alpha(x) \\leq 1)\\), and \\(R\\)\nexpresses a primitive recursive relation of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(x\\).\nConversely, GDK entails the weak completeness of \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\).\nThis interesting principle, which would justify the negative\ninterpretation of a form of Brouwer’s Fan Theorem, is weaker\nthan MP but unprovable in current systems of intuitionistic analysis.\nKreisel [1962] suggested that GDK may eventually be provable on the\nbasis of as yet undiscovered properties of intuitionistic\nmathematics. \nBy modifying the definition of a Kripke model to allow\n“exploding nodes” which force every sentence, Veldman\n[1976] found a completeness proof using only intuitionistic logic, but\nhe questioned whether Kripke models with exploding nodes were\nintuitionistically meaningful mathematical objects. \nOne way to implement the B-H-K explanation of intuitionistic truth for\narithmetic is to associate with each sentence \\(E\\) of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\)\nsome collection of numerical codes for algorithms which could\nestablish the constructive truth of \\(E\\). Following Kleene [1945], a\nnumber \\(e\\) realizes a sentence \\(E\\) of the language of\narithmetic by induction on the logical form of \\(E\\):  \nAn arbitrary formula is realizable if some number realizes its\nuniversal closure. Observe that not both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are\nrealizable, for any formula \\(A\\). The fundamental result is  \nNelson’s Theorem [1947]\n\nIf \\(A\\) is derivable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) from realizable formulas\n\\(F\\), then \\(A\\) is realizable. \nSome nonintuitionistic principles can be shown to be realizable. For\nexample, Markov’s Principle (for decidable formulas)\ncan be expressed by the schema  \nAlthough unprovable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), MP is realizable by an\nargument which uses Markov’s Principle informally. But\nrealizability is a fundamentally nonclassical interpretation. In\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) it is possible to express an axiom of recursive choice\nCT (for “Church’s Thesis”), which contradicts LEM\nbut is (constructively) realizable. Hence by Nelson’s Theorem,\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) MP \\(+\\) CT is consistent. \nKleene used a variant of number-realizability to prove \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\)\nsatisfies the Church-Kleene Rule; the same argument works for\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) with MP or CT, and for \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) MP \\(+\\)\nCT. In Kleene and Vesley [1965] and Kleene [1969], functions replace\nnumbers as realizing objects, establishing the consistency of\nformalized intuitionistic analysis and its closure under a\nsecond-order version of the Church-Kleene Rule. Nelson’s Theorem establishes the unprovability in\n\\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) of some theorems of classical predicate logic. If, to\neach \\(n\\)-place predicate letter \\(P(\\ldots )\\), a formula \\(f(P)\\)\nof \\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) with \\(n\\) free variables is assigned, and if\nthe formula \\(f(A)\\) of \\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) comes from the formula\n\\(A\\) of \\(L\\) by replacing each prime formula \\(P(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)\\)\nby \\(f(P)(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\), then \\(f(A)\\) is called\nan arithmetical substitution instance of \\(A\\).  As an\nexample, if a formula of \\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) expressing “\\(x\\)\ncodes a proof in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) of the formula with code \\(y\\)”\nis assigned to \\(P(x,y)\\), the resulting arithmetical substitution\ninstance of \\(\\forall y (\\exists x P(x, y) \\vee \\neg \\exists x P(x,\ny))\\) is unrealizable and hence unprovable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), and so\nis its double negation.  It follows that \\(\\neg \\neg \\forall y\n(\\exists x P(x, y) \\vee \\neg \\exists x P(x, y))\\) is not provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\). \nDe Jongh [1970] combined realizability with Kripke modeling to show\nthat intuitionistic propositional logic \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) and a\nfragment of \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) are arithmetically complete for\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\).  A uniform assignment of simple existential formulas\nto predicate letters suffices to prove \nDe Jongh’s Theorem (for IPC) [1970]\n\nIf a propositional formula \\(A\\) of the language \\(L\\) is not provable in\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), then some arithmetical substitution instance of\n\\(A\\) is not provable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). \nThe proof of this version of de Jongh’s Theorem does not need\nrealizability; cf. Smorynski [1973]. As an example, Rosser’s\nform of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem provides a sentence\n\\(C\\) of \\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{PA}\\) proves neither\n\\(C\\) nor \\(\\neg C\\), so by the disjunction property \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\)\ncannot prove \\((C \\vee \\neg C)\\).  But de Jongh’s semantical\nproof also established that every intuitionistically unprovable\npredicate formula of a restricted kind has an arithmetical\nsubstitution instance which is unprovable in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\).  Using a\nsyntactic method, Daniel Leivant [1979] extended de Jongh’s\nTheorem to all intuitionistically unprovable predicate formulas,\nproving that \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) is arithmetically complete for\n\\(\\bf{HA}\\).  See van Oosten [1991] for a historical exposition and a\nsimpler proof of the full theorem, using abstract realizability with\nBeth models instead of Kripke models. \nWithout claiming that number-realizability coincides with\nintuitionistic arithmetical truth, Nelson observed that for each\nformula \\(A\\) of \\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) the predicate “\\(y\\)\nrealizes \\(A\\)” can be expressed in \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) by another\nformula (abbreviated “\\(y \\realizesrel A\\)”), and the\nschema \\(A \\leftrightarrow \\exists y (y \\realizesrel A)\\) is\nconsistent with \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\). Troelstra [1973] showed that\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) \\((A \\leftrightarrow \\exists y (y \\realizesrel\nA))\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) ECT, where ECT is a\nstrengthened form of CT. In \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) MP \\(+\\) ECT, which\nTroelstra considers to be a formalization of Russian recursive\nmathematics (cf. section 3.2 of the entry on\n constructive mathematics),\n every formula of the form \\((y \\realizesrel A)\\) has an equivalent\n“classical” prenex form \\(A'(y)\\) consisting of a\nquantifier-free subformula preceded by alternating\n“classical” quantifiers of the forms \\(\\neg \\neg \\exists x\n\\) and \\(\\forall z \\neg \\neg \\), and so \\(\\exists y A'(y)\\) is a kind\nof prenex form of \\(A\\). \nAt present there are several other entries in this encyclopedia\ntreating intuitionistic logic in various contexts, but a general\ntreatment of weaker and stronger propositional and predicate logics\nappears to be lacking. Many such logics have been identified and\nstudied. Here are a few examples. \nA subintuitionistic propositional logic can be obtained from\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) by restricting the language, or weakening the logic,\nor both. An extreme example of the first is \\(\\mathbf{RN}\\),\nintuitionistic logic with a single propositional variable \\(P\\), which\nis named after its discoverers Rieger and Nishimura [1960].\n\\(\\mathbf{RN}\\) is characterized by the Rieger-Nishimura\nlattice of infinitely many nonequivalent formulas \\(F_n\\) such\nthat every formula whose only propositional variable is \\(P\\) is\nequivalent by intuitionistic logic to some \\(F_n\\). Nishimura’s\nversion is \nIn \\(\\mathbf{RN}\\) neither \\(F_{2 n + 1}\\) nor \\(F_{2 n + 2}\\) implies\nthe other; but \\(F_{2 n}\\) implies \\(F_{2 n + 1}\\), and \\(F_{2 n +\n1}\\) implies each of \\(F_{2 n + 3}\\) and \\(F_{2 n + 4}\\).  \nFragments of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) missing one or more logical connectives\nrestrict the language and incidentally the logic, since the\nintuitionistic connectives \\(\\oldand\\), \\(\\vee\\), \\(\\rightarrow\\),\n\\(\\neg\\) are logically independent over \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\). Rose [1953]\nproved that the implicationless fragment (without\n\\(\\rightarrow\\)) is complete with respect to realizability, in the\nsense that if every arithmetical substitution instance of a\npropositional formula \\(E\\) without \\(\\rightarrow\\) is\n(number)-realizable then \\(E\\) is a theorem of \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\). This\nresult contrasts with \nRose’s Theorem [1953]\n\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is incomplete with respect to realizability. \nLet \\(F\\) be the propositional formula \n\n\\[\n\n( ( \\neg \\neg D \\rightarrow D) \\rightarrow\n( \\neg \\neg D \\vee \\neg D ) )\n\\rightarrow ( \\neg \\neg D \\vee \\neg D)\n\n\\]\n\n where \\(D\\) is\n\\((\\neg P \\vee \\neg Q)\\) and \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) are prime. Every\narithmetical substitution instance of \\(F\\) is realizable (using\nclassical logic), but \\(F\\) is not provable in \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\). \nIt follows that \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is arithmetically incomplete for\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) \\(+\\) ECT (cf. Section 5.2). \nMinimal logic \\(\\mathbf{ML}\\) comes from intuitionistic logic\nby deleting ex falso. Kolmogorov [1925] showed that this\nfragment already contains a negative interpretation of classical logic\nretaining both quantifiers, cf. Leivant [1985]. Minimal logic does\nprove the special case \\(\\neg A \\rightarrow (A \\rightarrow \\neg B)\\)\nof ex falso for negations. Colacito, de Jongh and Vardas\n[2017] study various subminimal logics, each weaker than\n\\(\\mathbf{ML}\\). \nGriss contested Brouwer’s use of negation, objecting to both the\nlaw of contradiction and ex falso. It is worth noting that\nnegation is not really needed for intuitionistic mathematics since \\(0\n= 1\\) is a known contradiction so \\(\\neg A\\) can be defined by \\(A\n\\rightarrow 0 = 1\\). Then ex falso can be stated as \\(0 = 1\n\\rightarrow A\\), and the law of contradiction is provable from the\nremaining axioms of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). \nAn intermediate propositional logic is any consistent\ncollection of propositional formulas containing all the axioms of\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) and closed under modus ponens and\nsubstitution of arbitrary formulas for proposition letters. Each\nintermediate propositional logic is contained in \\(\\mathbf{CPC}\\).\nSome particular intermediate propositional logics, characterized by\nadding one or more classically correct but intuitionistically\nunprovable axiom schemas to \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), have been studied\nextensively. \nOne of the simplest intermediate propositional logics is the\nGödel-Dummett logic \\(\\mathbf{LC}\\), obtained by adding to\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) the schema \\((A \\rightarrow B) \\vee (B \\rightarrow\nA)\\) which is valid on all and only those Kripke frames in which the\npartial order of the nodes is linear. Gödel [1932] used an\ninfinite sequence of successively stronger intermediate logics to show\nthat \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) has no finite truth-table interpretation. For\neach positive integer \\(n\\), let \\(\\mathbf{G_n}\\) be \\(\\mathbf{LC}\\)\nplus the schema \\((A_1 \\rightarrow A_2) \\vee \\ldots \\vee (A_1 \\oldand\n\\ldots \\oldand A_n \\rightarrow A_{n + 1})\\). Then \\(\\mathbf{G_n}\\) is\nvalid on all and only those linearly ordered Kripke frames with no\nmore than \\(n\\) nodes.  \nThe Jankov logic \\(\\mathbf{KC}\\), which adds to \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) the\nprinciple of testability \\(\\neg A \\vee \\neg \\neg A\\),\nobviously does not have the disjunction property. The Kreisel-Putnam\nlogic \\(\\mathbf{KP}\\), obtained by adding to \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) the\nschema \\((\\neg A \\rightarrow B \\vee C) \\rightarrow((\\neg A \\rightarrow\nB) \\vee (\\neg A \\rightarrow C))\\), has the disjunction property but\ndoes not satisfy all the Visser rules. The intermediate logic obtained\nby adding the schema \\(((\\neg \\neg D \\rightarrow D) \\rightarrow(D \\vee\n\\neg D)) \\rightarrow (\\neg \\neg D \\vee \\neg D)\\), corresponding to\nRose’s counterexample, to \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) also has the\ndisjunction property. Iemhoff [2005] proved that \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) is\nthe only intermediate propositional logic with the disjunction\nproperty which is closed under all the Visser rules. Iemhoff and\nMetcalfe [2009] developed a formal calculus for generalized\nadmissibility for \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) and some intermediate logics.\nGoudsmit [2015] is a thorough study of the admissible rules of\nintermediate logics, with a comprehensive bibliography. \nAn intermediate propositional logic \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is said to have the\nfinite frame property if there is a class of finite frames on\nwhich the Kripke-valid formulas are exactly the theorems of\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\). Many intermediate logics, including \\(\\mathbf{LC}\\)\nand \\(\\mathbf{KP}\\), have this property. Jankov [1968] used an\ninfinite sequence of finite rooted Kripke frames to prove that there\nare continuum many intermediate logics. De Jongh, Verbrugge and Visser\n[2009] proved that every intermediate logic \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) with the\nfinite frame property is the propositional logic of\n\\(\\mathbf{HA(L)}\\), that is, the class of all formulas in the language\nof \\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\) all of whose arithmetical substitution instances\nare provable in the logical extension of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) by\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\). \nAn intermediate propositional logic \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is structurally\ncomplete if every rule which is admissible for \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is\nderivable in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), and hereditarily structurally\ncomplete if every intermediate logic extending \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) is\nalso structurally complete. Every intermediate logic \\(\\mathbf{L}\\)\nhas a structural completion \\(\\mathbf{\\overline{L}}\\),\nobtained by adjoining all its admissible rules. \\(\\mathbf{LC}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{G_n}\\) are hereditarily structurally complete. While\n\\(\\mathbf{IPC}\\), \\(\\mathbf{RN}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{KC}\\) are not\nstructurally complete, their structural completions are hereditarily\nstructurally complete. For these results and more, see Citkin [2016,\nOther Internet Resources]. \nSome intermediate predicate logics, extending\n\\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) and closed under substitution, are \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\)\n\\(+\\) DNS (Section 4.1), \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) \\(+\\) MP (cf. Section 5.2),\n\\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) \\(+\\) MP \\(+\\) IP (cf. Section 4.2), and the\nintuitionistic logic of constant domains \\(\\mathbf{CD}\\)\nobtained by adding to \\(\\mathbf{IQC}\\) the schema \\(\\forall x (A \\vee\nB(x)) \\rightarrow (A \\vee \\forall x B(x))\\) for all formulas \\(A\\),\n\\(B(x)\\) with \\(x\\) not occurring free in \\(A\\). Mints, Olkhovikov and\nUrquhart [2012, Other Internet Resources] showed that \\(\\mathbf{CD}\\)\ndoes not have the interpolation property, refuting earlier published\nproofs by other authors. \nBrouwer’s influence on Gödel was significant, although\nGödel never became an intuitionist. Gödel’s [1933f]\ntranslation of intuitionistic propositional logic into the\n modal logic\n \\(\\mathbf{S4}\\) is described in Section 2.5 of the entry on\n Gödel\n and in Troelstra’s introductory note to the translation of\n[1933f] in Volume I of Gödel’s Collected Works. See also\nMints [2012]. Kripke models for modal logic predated those for\nintuitionistic logic. \nAlternatives to Kripke and Beth semantics for intuitionistic\npropositional and predicate logic include the topological\ninterpretation of Stone [1937], Tarski [1938] and Mostowski [1948]\n(cf. Rasiowa and Sikorski [1963], Rasiowa [1974]), which was extended\nto intuitionistic analysis by Scott [1968] and Krol [1978]. M. Hyland\n[1982] defined the effective topos Eff and proved that its\nlogic is intuitionistic. For a very informative discussion of\nsemantics for intuitionistic logic and mathematics by W. Ruitenberg,\nand an interesting new perspective by G. Bezhanishvili and W.\nHolliday, see Other Internet Resources (below).  \nOne alternative to realizability semantics for intuitionistic\narithmetic is Gödel’s [1958] “Dialectica”\ninterpretation, which associates with each formula \\(B\\) of\n\\(L(\\mathbf{HA})\\) a quantifier-free formula \\(B_D\\) in the language\nof intuitionistic arithmetic of all finite types. The\n“Dialectica” interpretation of \\(B\\), call it\n\\(B^D\\), is \\(\\exists Y\\forall x B_D (Y, x)\\). If \\(B\\) is a closed\ntheorem of \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\), then \\(B_D (F, x)\\) is provable for some\nterm \\(F\\) in Gödel’s theory \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) of\n“primitive recursive” functionals of higher type. The\ntranslation from \\(B\\) to \\(B^D\\) requires the axiom of choice (at all\nfinite types), MP and IP, so is not strictly constructive; however,\nthe number-theoretic functions expressible by terms \\(F\\) of\n\\(\\mathbf{T}\\) are precisely the provably recursive functions of\n\\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) (and of \\(\\mathbf{PA})\\). The interpretation was\nextended to analysis by Spector [1962]; cf. Howard [1973]. Clear\nexpositions, and additional references, are to be found in\nTroelstra’s introduction to the English translation in\nGödel [1990] of the original Dialectica article, in\nAvigad and Feferman [1998], and in Ferreira [2008]. \nWhile \\(\\mathbf{HA}\\) is a proper part of classical arithmetic, the\nintuitionistic attitude toward mathematical objects results in a\ntheory of real numbers (cf. sections 3.4–3.7 of the entry on\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics)\n diverging from the classical. Kleene’s function-realizability\ninterpretation, developed to prove the consistency of his\nformalization \\(\\mathbf{FIM}\\) of the intuitionistic theory of\nsequences (“intuitionistic analysis”), changes the\ninterpretation of arithmetical formulas; for example, \\(\\neg \\neg\n\\forall x (A(x) \\vee \\neg A(x))\\) is function-realizable for every\narithmetical formula \\(A(x)\\). In the language of analysis,\nMarkov’s Principle and the negative translation of the countable\naxiom of choice are among the many non-intuitionistic principles which\nare function-realizable (by classical arguments) and hence consistent\nwith \\(\\mathbf{FIM}\\); cf. Kleene [1965], Vesley [1972] and\nMoschovakis [2003]. \nConcrete and abstract realizability semantics for a wide variety of\nformal systems have been developed and studied by logicians and\ncomputer scientists; cf. Troelstra [1998] and van Oosten [2002] and\n[2008]. Variations of the basic notions are especially useful for\nestablishing relative consistency and relative independence of the\nnonlogical axioms in theories based on intuitionistic logic; some\nexamples are Moschovakis [1971], Lifschitz [1979], and the\nrealizability notions for constructive and intuitionistic set theories\ndeveloped by Rathjen [2006, 2012] and Chen [2012]. Early abstract\nrealizability notions include the slashes of Kleene [1962,\n1963] and Aczel [1968], and Läuchli [1970]. Kohlenbach, Avigad\nand others have developed realizability interpretations for parts of\nclassical mathematics. \nArtemov’s\n justification logic\n is an alternative interpretation of the B-H-K explanation of the\nintuitionistic connectives and quantifiers, with (idealized) proofs\nplaying the part of realizing objects. See also Artemov and Iemhoff\n[2007]. \nAnother line of research in intuitionistic logic concerns\nBrouwer’s very controversial “creating subject\ncounterexamples” to principles of classical analysis (such as\nMarkov’s Principle) which could not be refuted on the basis of\nthe theory \\(\\mathbf{FIM}\\) of Kleene and Vesley [1965]. By weakening\nKleene’s form of Brouwer’s principle of continuous choice,\nand adding an axiom he called Kripke’s Schema (KP),\nMyhill managed to formalize the creating subject arguments. KP is\ninconsistent with \\(\\mathbf{FIM}\\), but Vesley [1970] found an\nalternative principle (Vesley’s Schema VS) which can\nconsistently be added to \\(\\mathbf{FIM}\\) and implies all the\ncounterexamples for which Brouwer required a creating subject. Krol\n[1978] and Scowcroft gave topological consistency proofs for\nintuitionistic analysis with Kripke’s Schema and weak\ncontinuity. \nThe entry on\n L. E. J. Brouwer\n discusses Brouwer’s philosophy and mathematics, with a\nchronology of his life and a selected list of publications including\ntranslations and secondary sources. The best way to learn more is to\nread some of the original papers. English translations of\nBrouwer’s doctoral dissertation and other papers which\noriginally appeared in Dutch, along with a number of articles in\nGerman, can be found in L. E. J. Brouwer: Collected Works\n[1975], edited by Heyting. Benacerraf and Putnam’s essential\nsource book contains Brouwer [1912] (in English translation), Brouwer\n[1949] and Dummett [1975]. Mancosu’s [1998] provides English\ntranslations of many fundamental articles by Brouwer, Heyting,\nGlivenko and Kolmogorov, with illuminating introductory material by W.\nvan Stigt whose [1990] is another valuable resource.  \nThe third edition [1971] of Heyting’s classic [1956] is an\nattractive introduction to intuitionistic philosophy, logic and\nmathematical practice. As part of the formidable project of editing\nand publishing Brouwer’s Nachlass, van Dalen [1981]\nprovides a comprehensive view of Brouwer’s own intuitionistic\nphilosophy. The English translation, in van Heijenoort [1969], of\nBrouwer’s [1927] (with a fine introduction by Parsons) is still\nan indispensable reference for Brouwer’s theory of the\ncontinuum. Veldman [1990] and [2005] are authentic modern examples of\ntraditional intuitionistic mathematical practice. Troelstra [1991]\nplaces intuitionistic logic in its historical context as the common\nfoundation of constructive mathematics in the twentieth century.\nBezhanishvili and de Jongh [2005, Other Internet Resources] includes\nrecent developments in intuitionistic logic. \nKleene and Vesley’s [1965] gives a careful axiomatic treatment\nof intuitionistic analysis, a proof of its consistency relative to a\nclassically correct subtheory, and an extended application to\nBrouwer’s theory of real number generators. Kleene’s\n[1969] formalizes the theory of partial recursive functionals,\nenabling precise formalizations of the function-realizability\ninterpretation used in [1965] and of a related q-realizability\ninterpretation which gives the Church-Kleene Rule for intuitionistic\nanalysis. \nTroelstra’s [1973], Beeson’s [1985] and Troelstra and van\nDalen’s [1988] (with\n corrections)\n stand out as the most comprehensive studies of intuitionistic and\nsemi-intuitionistic formal theories, using both constructive and\nclassical methods, with useful bibliographies. Troelstra and\nSchwichtenberg [2000] presents the proof theory of classical,\nintuitionistic and minimal logic in parallel, focusing on sequent\nsystems. Troelstra’s [1998] presents formulas-as-types and\n(Kleene and Aczel) slash interpretations for propositional and\npredicate logic, as well as abstract and concrete realizabilities for\na multitude of applications. Martin-Löf’s constructive\ntheory of types [1984] (cf. Section 3.4 of the entry on\n constructive mathematics)\n provides another general framework within which intuitionistic\nreasoning continues to develop.","contact.mail":"joan@math.ucla.edu","contact.domain":"math.ucla.edu"}]
