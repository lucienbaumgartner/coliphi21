Many of the issues\ncan be organized around the following two questions: Is existence\na property of individuals? and Assuming that existence is a\nproperty of individuals, are there individuals that lack it?\n\n\nWhat does it mean to ask if existence is a property? A full answer to\nthis question requires a general theory of properties, which is well\nbeyond the scope of this article. But we can briefly sketch the\nlandscape to set up our discussion of existence. (See the entries on\n properties\n and\n substance\n for deeper discussion.) Properties contrast with individuals. This\ndistinction can be explicated using the instantiation relation. My cat\ninstantiates the property of being hungry, as that is a way he is. As\nmy cat is himself an individual, he is not instantiated by\nanything. So, while properties also instantiate—the property of\nbeing red, for example, has the property of being a color—only\nproperties are instantiated; individuals only instantiate. Our first\nquestion is whether existence is instantiated and, if so, whether it\nis instantiated by individuals like Obama, my chair, and the fig tree\nin my backyard. Do individuals, in addition to ordinary properties\nlike being hungry, being human, being comfortable to sit in, and\nneeding more water, instantiate a property expressed by the English\nverb ‘exists’? \n\n\nThere is a debate in the literature on properties between the abundant\nconception of properties, according to which there is a property\ncorresponding to every natural language predicate and, more generally,\nevery class of individuals, and the sparse conception of properties,\naccording to which a predicate expresses a property only if the\nobjects that predicate is true of resemble one another in an intrinsic\nway. If the abundant conception is true, then our first question may\nseem trivial: Existence is a property of individuals because sentences\nlike ‘Bill Gates exists’ are grammatical and there is a\nclass of all individuals and hence a corresponding property of\nexisting. It seems, then, that our first question has bite only if the\nsparse conception is true. But appearances deceive. As we will see in\nsection 1, there is a controversy as to whether the logical form of a\nsentence like ‘Bill Gates exists’ is really\nsubject-predicate in structure and so whether the English verb\n‘exists’ really is predicated of individuals. The question\nwhether existence is a property of individuals is perhaps more\nstraightforward on the sparse conception of properties. But the\nquestion can still be raised even on the abundant conception as the\nquestion whether existence is a property of individuals involved in\nour talk of what exists and what does not, which is then a question\nabout the logical form of the sentences used in our existential\ndiscourse. \n\n\nWe can trace the issue of whether existence is a property to a\ndisagreement between the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle and some\nof his medieval followers over the relationship between an\nindividual’s essence and its existence. The debate requires some\nbackground. We begin with the distinction between accident and essence\nand that distinction’s relation to contingency and necessity.\nSome of a thing’s properties are contingent, in the sense that\nthe thing might not have had them. I am writing right now, but I might\nhave been out for a run instead. So working on a paper right now is\none of my contingent properties. Contingent properties contrast with\nnecessary properties. I am necessarily human, in the sense that it is\nimpossible that I am a nonhuman. (It may be possible that it is not\nthe case that I am human, insofar as it is possible that I never\nexisted at all, in which case I would not have been, in that\npossibility, among the class of humans. But that is a different\nmatter.) All contingent properties are accidents and all essences are\nnecessary but, according to the Aristotelian, some necessary\nproperties are accidents. A thing’s essential properties are\ninseparable from the bearer, not only in the sense that the property\nis necessarily had by that object (insofar as that object were to\nexist), but in the deeper sense that any adequate account of what that\nobject is involves that property; they are part of any adequate\ndefinition of the thing or answer to the question ‘What is\nit?’. I am essentially a human and perhaps essentially the\nperson I in fact am, if there are individual essences in addition to\ngeneral essences. I am necessarily identical to something and\nnecessarily such that 2+2=4, but these properties are among my\naccidents, as they are not part of any adequate account of what I am\nand what distinguishes me from others.  While this distinction between\na thing’s necessary properties and its essential properties is\ncontroversial, there is no doubt that it was Aristotle’s view,\nshared by most of his medieval followers, and so informed the first\nhistorical occurrence of the debate about existence under\ndiscussion. Aristotle seems to have seen nothing more to existence\nthan essence; there is not a space between an articulation of what a\nthing is and that thing’s existing.  Saint Thomas Aquinas, on\nthe other hand, famously distinguished a thing’s essence from\nits existence. Aquinas argued something as follows, in chapter 4 of\nhis On Being and Essence. One can have an understanding of\nwhat a man or a phoenix is without knowing whether it exists. So,\nexistence is something in addition to essence.  In short, Aquinas\nargued that existence is a separate property as existence is not part\nof most objects’s natures and so those objects can be conceived\nor thought of separately from their existing.\n\n\nThere is a long and distinguished line of philosophers, including\nDavid Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell, who\nfollowed Aristotle in denying that existence is a separate property of\nindividuals, even as they rejected other aspects of Aristotle’s\nviews. Hume argued (in A Treatise of Human Nature 1.2.6) that\nthere is no impression of existence distinct from the impression of an\nobject, which is ultimately on Hume’s view a bundle of\nqualities. As all of our contentful ideas derive from impressions,\nHume concluded that existence is not a separate property of an object.\nKant’s criticism of the ontological arguments for the existence\nof God rested on a rejection of the claim that existence is a property\nof an object. Proponents of the ontological argument argue that the\nconcept of God as an entity with all perfections or a being of which\nno greater can be conceived entails God’s existence, as\nexistence is a perfection and a being that exists is greater than a\nbeing that does not exist. Kant objected (in his Critique of Pure\nReason, A596/B624-A602/B630) that existence is not a property.\n“Thus when I think a thing, through whichever and however many\npredicates I like (even in its thoroughgoing determination), not the\nleast bit gets added to the thing when I posit in addition that this\nthing is. For otherwise what would exist would not be the same as what\nI had thought in my concept, but more than that, and I could not say\nthat the very object of my concept exists” (A600/B628). Finally,\nboth Frege and Russell maintained that existence is not a property of\nindividuals but instead a second-order property—a property of\nconcepts, for Frege, and of propositional functions, for Russell.\nCrudely, to say that dinosaurs do not exist is to say that the\nproperty of being a dinosaur is not instantiated; to say that\nJean-Baptiste Botul does not exist is to say that some\nproperty—say, the property of being a unique post-war critic of\nKant and father of Butolism—is not instantiated. In neither case\nis it to say of some individual that it does not exist, which neither\nFrege nor Russell thought made sense.\n\n\nThe view that existence is not a property of individuals became the\ncommon view in the early 20th Century. While Aristotle, Hume, and\nKant’s related reasons for the thesis have persuaded some, the\ndominant force behind this agreement is the thought, developed most\nforcefully in [Russell 1905b], that denying that existence is a\nfirst-order property is the only way to avoid the consequence that\nthere are things that do not exist and thus that there is a\ndistinction between being and existing, our second framing question\nfrom above. The thesis that there are things that do not exist was\nheld by the Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong. Existence is a\ngenuine property of individuals, Meinong maintained, but not\nuniversally had. While there are many ways to motivate Meinongianism,\na primary motivation is the puzzle of negative singular\nexistentials—sentences that seem to truly assert the\nnonexistence of an individual, such as the sentence\n‘Jean-Baptiste Botul does not exist’. In order to be true,\nit seems, the subject position must designate some entity of which\nnonexistence is truly predicated, in which case there are\nthings—the designation of these singular terms—that do not\nexist. Frege and Russell, by contrast, take the same sentences to\ndemonstrate that those expressions are not genuine singular terms at\nall and that negative existentials all have a general form, asserting\nthe noninstantiation of a property.\n\n\nThe following section discusses\nFrege and Russell’s account of true negative existentials. \nThe second section discusses Meinongianism, comparing the account of\ntrue negative existentials on offer by the Meinongian with the\nRussellian account discussed in the first section. The article ends\nwith a discussion of an anti-Meinongian account according to which\nexistence is a universal property of individuals and a discussion of\nthe related issues of existence in the context of quantified tense and\nmodal logics.\n\nThere are two sets of reasons for denying that existence is a property\nof individuals. The first is Hume and Kant’s puzzlement over\nwhat existence would add to an object. What is the difference between\na red apple and a red existing apple? To be red (or even to be an\napple) it must already exist, as only existing things instantiate\nproperties. (This principle—that existence is conceptually prior\nto predication—is rejected by Meinongians.) Saying it is red and\nan apple and furthermore exists is to say one thing too many. The\nthought seems to be that instantiating any property whatsoever\npresupposes existence and so existence is not a further property over\nand above a thing’s genuine properties. The thought is not\nmerely that everything that instantiates any property exists, as the\nsame is true of being self-identical, being either human or not\nhuman—assuming the law of excluded middle—and being such\nthat 2+2=4, all of which seem to be unproblematic properties of\nindividuals even if that status is denied of existence. Instead the\nthought is that instantiating any property whatsoever conceptually\npresupposes the existence of a subject in a way that makes it\nincoherent to then think of existence as a further property of that\nthing. The thing’s existence is prior to any predication to it\nand so it is incoherent to think of existence as a property had by the\nthing. This thought is behind Aristotle’s thesis that existence\nis not a further feature of a thing beyond its essence. \nThe second consideration favoring the thesis that existence is not a\nproperty of individuals concerns the puzzle of negative singular\nexistentials. Suppose that existence is a property of the designation\nof the subject term in a singular existential sentence. Then\n‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ predicates nonexistence\nof the designation of the subject term, in which case reality includes\nan entity—the designation of the singular term and subject of\npredication—that has the property of not existing. That, Russell\ncomplained, runs contrary to a robust sense of reality, according to\nwhich everything exists. (See [Russell 1905a].) So, we should reject the claim that existence\nis a property of the designation of subject terms in existential\nsentences. \nTo appreciate Russell’s alternative account, consider first\ngeneral nonexistence claims. To say that foxes exist is to say that\nthere are some things that are foxes; that is, the property of being a\nfox is instantiated. This is reflected in the standard regimentation\nof the sentences ‘Foxes exist’ and ‘There are\nfoxes’ in first-order quantificational logic as\n∃xFx, where Fx is the translation for the\npredicate ‘x is a fox’. General kind terms do\nnot, then, designate individuals, which we then (redundantly) say\nexist when using the predicate ‘exists’ or (paradoxically)\nsay are not when using the predicate ‘does not\nexist’. Instead, kind terms designate properties and simple\nseeming subject-predicate sentences like ‘Foxes are\ncarnivores’ are claimed to possess a more complicated logical\nform, ∀x(Fx→ Cx),\nwhere Cx translates the predicate ‘x is a\ncarnivore’. (This ignores the difficult question whether\ngenerics are really quantifiers at all, made more troubling by the\nfact that some generics seem to admit of exceptions—‘Birds\nfly’ is true, even though penguins are birds and don’t\nfly; ‘Cats have four legs’ is true, even though there is a\nthree-legged cat wandering the planet. See the\nentry generics.) Given this analysis,\ngeneral nonexistence claims are unproblematic. The sentence\n‘Dragons do not exist’ says, on this analysis, that the\nproperty of being a dragon is not instantiated. Take the most\ninclusive class of what there is; nothing in that class has the\nproperty of being a dragon. That is what ¬∃xDx\nsays, letting Dx translate the predicate ‘x is\na dragon’. This is significant because it does not require\nidentifying some entity to then predicate of that thing the property\nof nonexistence. \nThe Frege-Russell view that existence is a second-order property is\nbased on the idea that seemingly singular existential and negative\nexistential sentence like ‘Bill Gates exists’ and\n‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ are, in their deeper\nlogical form, general existential and negative existential claims. Let\nus focus on Russell’s version of the view. \nRussell claimed that ordinary proper names like ‘Bill\nGates’ are disguised definite descriptions, something like\n‘the richest man in the world’. And definite descriptions,\ngiven Russell’s view of definite descriptions, are not genuine\nreferring terms but are instead quantificational expressions. The\nsentence ‘The richest man in the world lives in\nWashington’ has, as its logical form, a quantificational\nstructure and not a subject-predicate structure, equivalent to\nsomething like the following: There is a unique richest person who\nlives in Washington. Individuals do not enter directly into the\nproposition expressed by the sentence and are not part of the\nsentence’s truth conditions. \nThese features of Russell’s account of definite descriptions are\nsignificant for the treatment of seemingly singular existential and\nnegative existentials as they remove the need for entities to serve as\nthe designation of the singular terms for the meaningfulness and truth\nof negative existentials. Seemingly singular existentials like\n‘Bill Gates exists’ are assimilated to general\nexistentials like ‘Foxes exist’. Assuming the proper name\n‘Bill Gates’ is analyzed as the definite description\n‘the richest person alive’, the sentence ‘Bill Gates\nexists’ has a logical form that can be more accurately expressed\nas There is someone that is uniquely richer than anyone else\nalive. This is neither redundant nor uninformative, as we can\ngrasp in thought properties while coherently and rationally wondering\nwhether or not they are instantiated. Russell’s account\nsimilarly dissolves the problems generated by seemingly singular\nnegative existentials like ‘Ronald McDonald does not\nexist’. The truth of this sentence does not require a\ndesignation for the term of which nonexistence is then predicated.\n‘Ronald McDonald’ is short for a definite description,\nsay, ‘the happy hamburger clown’. The sentence\n‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ expresses a proposition\nof the form It is not the case that there is a unique happy\nhamburger clown. This proposition is true even if absolutely\neverything there is exists. The proposition concerns the property of\nbeing a happy hamburger clown and says of that property that it is not\nuniquely instantiated. As the property—the true subject of\npredication—exists, however, we are not forced to countenance\nthe reality of entities that do not exist in order to recognize this\nsentence as saying something true. \nRussell’s strategy depends on two claims. The first is that the\nnegation in a negative existential takes wide scope, applying to the\nwhole sub-sentence and not just the predicate. So, ‘Ronald\nMcDonald does not exist’ does not involve ascribing the\npredicate ‘is nonexistent’ to the subject ‘Ronald\nMcDonald’. Instead, it is more faithfully represented as\n‘It is not the case that [Ronald McDonald exists]’. The\nsecond is that ‘Ronald McDonald’ is not a genuine\nreferring expression and the predicate ‘exists’ really\nmeans something like is instantiated. Notice that the first\nin solitude is not sufficient to overcome the problems generated by\nseemingly true singular negative existentials. Even if the deep form of\n‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ is  ‘It is not\nthe case that [Ronald McDonald exists]’, assuming that\n‘Ronald McDonald’ is a genuine singular term, the problem\nremains of finding in reality some entity to serve as the designation\nof ‘Ronald McDonald’. That entity is then part of reality\nand so, assuming that Meinongianism is false, is existent. In that\ncase, the sub-proposition Ronald McDonald exists is true and\nso its negation false. The problem of true singular negative\nexistentials does not rest on the supposition that they involve\nascribing the property of nonexistence. So, it is the second of the\nabove claims that carries the weight of Russell’s solution to\nthe problem of singular negative existentials. \nThe second component of the Russellian solution—the claim that\nordinary proper names like ‘Bill Gates’ are disguised\ndefinite descriptions—faces a number of objections. One is the\nsemantic argument. (See [Kripke 1972].) Suppose that the descriptive\nequivalent of the name ‘Bill Gates’ is ‘the richest\nliving person in the world’. An adequate semantic understanding\nof the sentence ‘Bill Gates is richer than everyone else\nalive’ would then be sufficient for recognition of its truth.\n(More precisely, the sentence, ‘If anyone is richer than\neveryone else alive, then Bill Gates is richer than everyone else\nalive’ has this feature.) But that seems implausible. Surely we\nmust collect empirical data to determine its truth. One who wonders\nwhether someone, say, Warren Buffett, is wealthier than Bill Gates\ndoes not display irrationality or semantic ignorance, comparable to\none who wonders whether a fortnight is longer than 14 nights. \nPerhaps these considerations should motivate the descriptivist to\nabandon “great deeds” descriptions in favor of\nmetalinguistic descriptions like ‘the person named ‘Bill\nGates’’ or causal descriptions like ‘the person that\nstands at the origin of this chain of uses of the name ‘Bill\nGates’’. (For discussion, see [Bach 1981, 2002], [Kroon\n1987], and [Lewis 1984].) It is plausible that semantic competence\nsuffices to know that the sentence ‘Bill Gates is named\n‘Bill Gates’’ is true and, while perhaps importing\nextra-semantic facts about language use, it is plausible that any\nreflective speaker of English knows that any token of ‘Bill\nGates is the person that stands at the origin of this chain of uses of\nthe name ‘Bill Gates’’ is true. So these\ndescriptions seem to survive the semantic argument presented in the\nprevious paragraph. But they face another objection, also facing\nsimpler versions of descriptivism: Namely, the modal objection\n([Kripke 1972]). While it is absolutely impossible that Bill Gates is\nnot Bill Gates, it is, it seems, metaphysically possible that Bill\nGates is not the richest person alive, instead being a middle\nAmerican, and it seems metaphysically possible that he is not named\n‘Bill Gates’ and does not stand at the causal origin of\nany particular chain of uses of the name ‘Bill Gates’,\nunless the chain is individuated in part in terms of the actual\nindividual that grounds it.  This suggests that ordinary proper names\nand their alleged descriptive equivalents considered above are not, in\nfact, semantically equivalent, as they embed differently under modals\nlike ‘it is necessary that’. [See the entry on\n names\n for further discussion of these problems.] \nIn response to the modal argument, the descriptivist might avail\nherself of individual essence descriptions like ‘the person\nidentical to Bill Gates’, ‘the person that\nBill-Gatizes’, or rigidifications of the above descriptions,\n‘the person actually named ‘Bill Gates’’ and\n‘the person that actually stands at the origin of this chain of\nuses of the name ‘Bill Gates’’, all of which\ndesignate the same person in every possible world in which they\ndesignate anything. It is plausible that semantic competence suffices\nfor recognition of the truth of the sentence ‘Bill Gates is the\nperson identical to Bill Gates’ and that that sentence expresses\na necessary truth. So these versions of descriptivism seem to escape\nthe problems discussed in the previous paragraphs. The first two\ncandidates, however, do not hold much promise for solving the problem\nof apparently true singular negative existentials. We know what the\nproperty of being identical to Bill Gates is, but only because we know\nthe result of plugging up one of the relata in the two-place relation\nis identical to with the individual Bill Gates.\nInsofar as we think that reality does not include any entity identical\nto Ronald McDonald, however, we are then left to wonder what the\nproperty of being identical to Ronald McDonald is. Because the\ncontents of these properties are derivative from the individuals that\nserve as the referents of their names, they are poor candidate\ndescriptive equivalences for a robust version of descriptivism and\nunlikely to shed light on the truth of seemingly singular negative\nexistentials like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’.\nSimilar considerations apply to the predicating view.  \nThe last candidates, rigidified metalinguistic and causal\ndescriptions, are the most promising for a robust form of descriptivism. But some have claimed to discern\nimportant differences in the functioning of a name and its alleged\nsemantically equivalent rigidified description, of any flavor. First,\nsome have claimed that the name ‘Bill Gates’ designates\nBill Gates with respect to every possible world, including worlds at\nwhich Bill Gates does not exist; otherwise the sentence ‘Bill\nGates does not exist’ would not be true with respect to those\nworlds. But the rigidified description ‘the person actually\nnamed ‘Bill Gates’’, for example, does not designate\nanything with respect to such a world, as nothing in the domain of\nthat world satisfies the condition being named ‘Bill\nGates’ at the actual world. That is because it is only Bill\nGates that satisfies that condition and he is not a member of the\ndomain of the possible world in question. So, differences in how a\nname and a rigidified description embed under modal operators can\nstill be discerned. (See [Salmon 1981] for further discussion.) This\nobjection assumes that the domain of quantification varies from world\nto world and that individuals that serve as the designation of\nordinary names are genuine contingent existents, theses that can be denied.\nThe objection also assumes that the range of the description is the\ndomain of the world with respect to which the description is being\nevaluated, the actuality operator rigidifying only the condition of\nthe description, which may also be denied. The second objection to\nrigidified descriptivism concerns the differences some have claimed\nbetween how names and rigidified descriptions embed under\npropositional attitude verbs. Intuitively, Jones would have still\nbelieved that Bill Gates is wealthy even if things had been ever so\nslightly different than they actually are—say, I bought a poppy\nbagel instead of a sesame bagel this morning. But if the content of\nJones’s belief concerns the actual world, as rigidified\ndescriptivism dictates, then, to retain his actual belief in that\ncounterfactual situation, he would have to believe something about\nanother possible world—the actual world. But it is implausible\nthat Jones would have a belief about another possible world. So, the\ncontent of Jones’s belief does not concern the actual world and\nso one can believe what is expressed by ‘Bill Gates is\nwealthy’ without believing what is expressed by ‘The\nperson that actually stands at the origin of this chain of uses of the\nname ‘Bill Gates’ is wealthy’. (See [Soames\n1998].)  \nThis section examined the thesis that seemingly singular\nexistential and negative existential sentences are really general\nexistentials, which are then treated as ascribing the property of\nbeing instantiated or not instantiated to some property. The need to\ngrant being to entities that do not exist in order to account for the\ntruth of sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’\nis then avoided, which is no small victory. The success of that\nproposal, however, was seen to rest on the claim that ordinary proper\nnames have descriptive equivalences, which many philosophers of\nlanguage reject. (For more on the question of whether or not\n‘exists’ is a genuine first-order predicate in deep\nlogical form, see, in addition to the earlier references in this\nsection: [Crane 2012], [Dancy 1986], [Geach 1954.1986], [Haaparanta\n1986], [Hintikka 1984,1986], [Kneale 1936], [Mackie 1976], [McGinn\n2000], [Miller 1975,1986] [Moltmamnn 2013], [Moore 1936], [Owen 1965],\n[Pears 1967], [Quine 1948], [van Inwagen 2008], [Vilkko and Hintikka\n2006], [Wiggins 1995], [Williams 1981], and [Williams 1995]. \nIn part on the basis of the above discussed problems, many\nphilosophers reject descriptivism and accept that ordinary proper\nnames are devices of direct reference, that there are true genuinely\nsingular negative existentials, and so that there are nonexistent\nobjects. ‘Ronald McDonald’ seems like a referring term,\nopen to existential generalization, in the sense that a sentence like\n‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ entails ‘There is\nsomething that does not exist’, and ‘exists’ seems\nlike a predicate that applies or fails to apply to the designation of\nsubject-place terms, on a par with a predicate like\n‘sits’. The Meinongian embraces these appearances and\nconcludes that reality includes referents for empty names and those\nreferents do not exist. The Meinongian trades logical and semantic\nsimplicity for metaphysical abundance. \nMeinongianism is the thesis that there are objects that do not exist\nand so included in the most unrestricted domain of quantification and\ndiscourse are nonexistent entities. One immediate challenge for the\nMeinongian is to offer individuating conditions for nonexistents. The\nmost straightforward comprehension principle is the naive principle\nthat, for any condition on objects, there is a unique object\nsatisfying exactly that condition. For our purposes, we can conceive\nof a condition as determining a set of properties; crudely, the\nproperties expressed by the predicates composing the condition. In\nthat case, condition C is the same condition as\nC′ when they determine the same set of properties. It\nfollows that corresponding to any set of properties, there is exactly\none object with exactly those properties. The naive comprehension\nprinciple faces several problems. In what remains of this section, we\nshall present these problems and distinguish different versions of\nMeinongianism in terms of the devices employed to develop a restricted\ncomprehension principle for objects that avoids those problems. (All\nof these problems are developed in Russell’s discussion of Meinong,\nsee [Russell 1905a, 1907]. For a discussion of the debate between\nRussell and Meinong, see [Smith 1985].) \nThe first is the problem of incomplete objects. Conditions need not be\ntotal; that is, we do not require that the set of properties a\ncondition determines is such that, for every property, either it or\nits complement is a member of that set. So, by the naive comprehension\nprinciple, the condition of being a singer defines an object with\nexactly that property—being a singer—and no other\nproperties. A set with other properties as well is a distinct set of\nproperties and so corresponds to a different condition and hence a\ndifferent object. Some find incomplete objects problematic in\nthemselves, as they are counterexamples to bivalence: Our singer, for\nexample, has neither the property of wearing a dress nor the property\nof not wearing a dress. But they also lead to more general threats of\nparadox. Our singer is an object with exactly one property: That of\nbeing a singer. This is its sole defining characteristic. So having a\nexactly one property is also a property of our singer and that\nproperty is distinct from the property of being a singer, which our\nsinger also has. So, the singer has two properties. Contradiction. One\nsimple solution is to restrict the comprehension principle to total\nconditions. The resulting proposal, however, leads to a questionable\napplication of Meinongian metaphysics to problems of fictional truth,\nas many want to claim that there is simply no fact of the matter as to\nwhether or not Sherlock Holmes has a mole on his left shoulder, as\nthat is left underdetermined by the Holmes stories and there are no\ndeeper grounds for either predication.  The promise of employing\nnonexistent objects in explaining apparent truths about fiction is one\nof the theory’s main virtues.  Relatedly, this solution\nundermines a primary motivation for Meinongianism—namely, the\nidea that there is a subject of predication corresponding to any\nobject of thought, as we certainly do not think only of complete\nobjects. So, the simple solution is too simple and the Meinongian is\nbetter to find another, more complex solution to the problems of\nincompleteness. \nThe second is the problem of contradiction. A naive comprehension\nprinciple generates objects that violate the principle of\nnoncontradiction. Consider the condition of being taller than\neverything. By the naive comprehension principle, this condition\ndetermines an object and so there is an object that has exactly the\nproperty of being taller than everything. But then it is taller than\nitself, which is a contradiction given the irreflexivity of the taller\nthan relation. The irreflexivity of the taller than relation is\nnonlogical. But not so with the identity relation, as = is typically\ntaken to be a logical predicate. It is a logical truth that everything\nis self-identical; i.e., the sentence ∀x x=x is true\nunder every interpretation. But consider the property of being\nself-distinct. By the naive comprehension principle this condition\ndetermines an object and that object is self-distinct. But then that\nobject does not satisfy the condition x=x. So our logically\ntrue sentence has a counterinstance. Contradiction. \nA third problem, one of Russell’s objections to Meinongianism\n(see [Russell 1905a, 1907]), turns on the fact that existence is, on\nMeinongianism, a property and hence figures into the base of the naive\ncomprehension principle. So, consider the condition of being winged,\nbeing a horse, and existing. By the naive comprehension principle,\nthere is an object with exactly these features. But then this object\nexists, as existing is one of its characterizing features.\nIntuitively, however, there is no existent winged horse. An existent\nobject cannot so easily be thought into being. Indeed, for every\nintuitively nonexistent object that motivates\nMeinongianism—Zeus, Pegasus, Santa Clause, and Ronald\nMcDonald—there is, by the naive abstraction principle, an object\njust like it but with the additional property of existing. But then\nthere is an existing Zeus, an existing Pegasus, etc.. This is\noverpopulation not of being but of existence as well. \nThe naive comprehension principle, then, must be rejected and a\nrestricted principle connecting sets of properties with objects be put\nin its place.  The principle should generate enough objects to serve\nthe Meinongian purpose of ensuring a corresponding object for every\nthought while avoiding the problems discussed above. We can\ndistinguish two strategies, both suggested by Meinong’s student\nErnst Mally [Mally 1912]. The first distinguishes two kinds of\nproperties, what, following Terence Parsons [Parsons 1978, 1980], we\nshall call nuclear and extra-nuclear properties. While the distinction\nremains ultimately unclear, the key idea is that nuclear properties\nare part of a thing’s nature, broadly construed, and\nextra-nuclear properties are external to a thing’s nature; more\nprecisely, nuclear properties, but not extra-nuclear properties, are\npart of the characterization of what the object is. The comprehension\nprinciple is then restricted to conditions involving only nuclear\npredicates.  Problematic properties, like existing, etc., are deemed\nextra-nuclear and beyond the scope of the comprehension principle, not\ndetermining the objects that there are. Nuclear, not extra-nuclear,\nproperties individuate objects. The second Meinongian camp\ndistinguishes two modes of predication: What Mally called determining\nand satisfying, Hector-Neri Castañeda [Castañeda 1974,\n1975,1978, 1980, 1986, 1989, 1990] called internal and external\npredication, William Rapaport [Rapaport 1978] called constituency and\nexemplification, Kit Fine [Fine 1982] called implicit and explicit,\nand Edward Zalta [Zalta 1983, 1988] called encoding and\nexemplifying. There is, on this view, a single class of properties\nthat the comprehension principle ranges over, but the principle\ndetermines the properties encoded not exemplified (to follow\nZalta’s terminology) by the object characterized. For every\ncondition, there is a unique object that encodes just those\nproperties. An object may or may not exemplify the properties it\nencodes. Sherlock Holmes encodes the properties of being a detective\nand living at 221B Baker Street, etc., but he does not exemplify those\nproperties. He exemplifies (but does not encode) the properties of\nbeing a fictional character and being the hero of Arthur Conan\nDoyle’s Holmes stories. The properties an object exemplify are\nnot, on this view, a matter of mere stipulation. \nHow do these distinctions solve the problems raised above for the\nnaive comprehension principle? Let us begin with Parsons’s view.\nParsons focuses on the problems of contradiction and of the existent\nwinged horse. Following Russell’s discussion of Meinong, in\n[Russell 1905a, 1907], Parsons considers the threat of contradiction\ngenerated by impossible objects like the round square. Meinong claimed\nthat there is a round square, but that, complained Russell, leads to\nviolations of the principle of noncontradiction, as that entity is\nthen both round and not round, in light of the fact that it is square,\nwhich entails that it is not round. Parsons’s response (see\n[Parsons 1980], 38–42) seems to be to deny that being square\nentails not being round, in which case it is simply false that the\nround square is not round. He thinks that that implication holds only\nfor “real” objects. He claims that there are\ncounterexamples to the claim that all square objects are not round;\nafter all, the round square is a square object that is round! This\nsolution, however, does not seem to solve the more general threat of\ncontradiction, as discussed above. Indeed, Parsons himself recognizes\nthe limited success of his response (see [Parsons, 1980, 42n8]). He\nallows that being non-squared is a nuclear property. But then his\ncomprehension principle entails that there is an object corresponding\nto the condition of being a non-squared square, where that object\ninstantiates the incompatible properties of being a square and being a\nnon-square. The threat of contradiction has not been silenced. \nLet’s turn to Parsons’s response to the existence problem.\nThe naive comprehension principle faced the problem of generating an\nexistent winged horse. Because existence is an extra-nuclear property,\nhowever, Parsons’s version of the comprehension principle, which\ncorrelates sets of only nuclear properties to objects, avoids this\nproblem. The condition of being an existent winged horse is not\ncomposed solely of nuclear properties and so Parsons’s principle\ndoes not correlate it to an object. Parsons’s distinction\nbetween nuclear and extra-nuclear properties similarly promises to\nsolve the problem of incomplete objects. Recall our singer from above.\nThat object does not have exactly one property; instead, it has\nexactly one nuclear property. As having exactly one nuclear property\nis itself an extra-nuclear property, much as being a complete object\nis on Parsons’s view, the threat of contradiction is\navoided.  \nThe distinction between nuclear and extra-nuclear properties remains\nunclear. Parsons introduced the distinction with lists of nuclear\npredicates (‘is blue’, ‘is tall’,\n‘kicked Socrates’, ‘is a mountain’) and\nextra-nuclear predicates (‘exists’, ‘is thought\nabout by Meinong’, ‘is complete’). He then tells us\nthat the extra-nuclear are those that do not stand for properties of\nindividuals ([Parsons 1980, 24]). And, of course, it is nuclear and\nnot extra-nuclear properties by which objects are individuated.\nParsons’s individuation principle for objects is the following:\n“(1) No two objects (real or unreal) have exactly the\nsame nuclear properties; and (2) For any set of nuclear properties,\nsome object has all the properties in that set and no other nuclear\nproperties” ([Parsons 1980, 19]). But it is not clear what\nstatus individual identity properties—properties like\nbeing identical to A, where A is an\nindividual substance like, say, Parsons himself—have with\nrespect to this distinction. He sometimes claims that they are\nextra-nuclear properties ([Parsons 1980, 28]). In that case, however,\nParsons is committed to the problematic thesis of the identity of\nindiscernibles and so the impossibility of two primitively distinct\nbut qualitatively identical objects. (For further discussion, see the\nentry on\n the identity of indiscernibles.)\nMany contemporary philosophers agree that objects are not individuated\nqualitatively, their identity and diversity being primitive. Max\nBlack’s two qualitatively indiscernible spheres are primitively\ndistinct, in virtue of which one has the property of being that very\nthing and the other lacking that property (see [Black 1953]). For\nParsons to accept this, he needs to include individual identity\nproperties among the nuclear properties. Furthermore, it is hard to\nsee why identity properties are not properties of\nindividuals. Suppose, then, that we count individual identity\nproperties like being identical to A as nuclear properties,\nthose properties entering the range of Parsons’s restricted\ncomprehension principle. Then the nuclear negations of those\nproperties are also nuclear. But then we can take the set of all\nobjects, construct the individual identity property for each,\nconstruct the nuclear negation of each of those properties, and then\nconstruct a condition from those properties that, by Parsons’s\ncomprehension principle, corresponds to an object.  Then there is an\nobject that is distinct from every object that there is, which is a\ncontradiction. It is unclear, then, that the distinction between\nnuclear and extra-nuclear properties and the restriction of the\ncomprehension principle to nuclear properties solves the problems\nfacing the naive comprehension principle. (For further discussion of\nParsons’s view, see [Fine 1982, 1984] and [Zalta 1992].) \nEarlier we distinguished between two versions of sophisticated\nMeinongianism.  The first, based on the distinction between nuclear\nand extra-nuclear properties, was found lacking. We turn now to the\nsecond, based on the distinction between encoding and exemplifying a\nproperty, focusing on Zalta’s version of the view, which is the\nmost fully developed in the literature. Whereas Parsons distinguished\ndifferent kinds of properties, restricting the comprehension principle\nto only nuclear properties in the hope of thereby avoiding the\nproblems plaguing the naive comprehension principle, Zalta\ndistinguishes two different modes of having a property for the same\neffect. Exemplifying a property is the familiar way in which an\nindividual has a property; it is roughly what most metaphysicians have\nin mind when the speak of instantiating a property. Obama exemplifies\nhumanity, my chair exemplifies being comfortable, and the fig tree in\nmy backyard exemplifies needing water. What the comprehension\nprinciple does is say not what properties object exemplify, in this\nsense, but rather what properties they encode. So, for any\ncondition C on properties, there is an object that encodes\nexactly those properties, which leaves open whether or not those\nobjects also exemplify those properties. \nHow does this distinction solve the problems facing Meinongianism\npresented earlier in this section? By the comprehension principle, the\ncondition of being a singer determines an object with exactly that\nproperty. But the comprehension principle does not imply that that\nobject exemplifies the property of being a singer but rather that it\nencodes that property. Exemplifying the property of being a singer\nrequires exemplifying other properties like having a spatial location,\nhaving a voice box, etc., all properties our singer neither encodes\nnor exemplifies. But the object can encode the property of being a\nsinger without encoding these further properties. The singer does\nexemplify some properties, such as the property of being abstract. The\nsinger encodes the property of being a singer, does not\nencode the property of being abstract, and exemplifies\nmultiple properties, including the property of being abstract, being\nthe topic of this paragraph, and not being a singer. This is not\ncontradictory given the fundamental difference between encoding and\nexemplifying.  More generally, Zalta’s comprehension principle\ncorrelates sets of properties with objects that encode, not\n(necessarily) exemplify, those properties. Insofar as the set of\nproperties characterizing an object are not complete, the resulting\nobject will be incomplete with respect to the properties it\nencodes. But it need not be incomplete with respect to the properties\nit exemplifies. While our singer encodes neither the property of\nwearing blue shoes nor the property of not wearing blue shoes, we can\nsay that it exemplifies the property of not wearing blue\nshoes. Bi-valence is saved, at least with respect to\nexemplification. \nRestricting the comprehension principle to the properties encoded and\nrejecting an easy transfer between properties encoded and properties\nexemplified also promises to avoid the other threats of contradiction\npresented above. Recall the logically impossible condition of being\nself-distinct. The principle of noncontradiction concerns the\nproperties objects exemplify, not the properties objects encode\n(assuming our Meinongian is going to account for impossible\nobjects). Because an object can encode inconsistent properties without\nexemplifying them, impossible objects do not violate the principle of\nnoncontradiction. Finally, Russell’s worry that a Meinongian\ncomprehension principle generates existent winged horses can be\nanswered. There is an object correlated to the condition of being an\nexistent winged horse, but that object encodes and does not exemplify\nthe property of existing. Being existent can characterize an object\nwithout that object exemplifying existence. So we do not need to worry\nabout an overpopulation of existent beings, as existent beings\nexemplify existence, which the existent winged horse does\nnot.  \nA view based on the distinction between encoding and exemplifying\navoids the standard objections to Meinongianism while promising to\ndeliver that view’s many benefits. The semantics and logic is\nstraightforward and simple and surface forms of the natural language\nsentences of interest in this article match their deep logical forms.\nBut the ontological costs are evident. There is semantic and logical\nsimplicity at a metaphysical price. (For more on Meingianism, in\naddition to the references earlier in this section, see the following:\n[Barz 2016], [Berto 2012], [Berto and Priest 2014], [Findlay 1963],\n[Griffin 1985], [Jacquette 1989, 1996], [Lambert 1983], [Landini\n1990], [Lewis 1990],[Priest 2005],[Rapaport 1976, 1978,,1981],\n[Routley 1966, 1979, 1980], [Voltolini 1995, 2006], [Zalta 1983,\n1985,1988,1992].)  \nThe previous two sections discussed views that deny that existence is\na property of individuals and views that deny that existence is a\nuniversal property. This section considers views according to which\nexistence is a universal property of individuals, in the hope of\nreaping the benefits of both the earlier views. It then explores the\ninteraction between quantifiers, tense operators, modal operators, and\na universal, first-order existence predicate in an attempt to expose\nsome difficulties such a view faces. \nFor both the Meinongian and the proponent of the proposal under\nconsideration, proper names are directly referential and simple\nsentences in which they occur express singular propositions. However,\nunlike the Meinongian, a proponent of the view to be developed in this\nsection insists that absolutely everything exists. In that case, a\nsentence like ‘Ronald McDonald does not exist’ either\nexpresses a fully articulate singular proposition and so is false, as\nin that case there is a referent of the subject-place singular term\nwhich exists, or does not express a truth evaluative proposition at\nall, as the singular term lacks a semantic content. In neither case is\nthe sentence true.  Avoiding that consequence was a primary motivation\nbehind all of the alternative accounts discussed in the previous two\nsections. The first challenge facing a proponent of such a view, then,\nis to explain how sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not\nexist’ are both meaningful and sometimes apparently true without\nabandoning the theses that absolutely everything exists and that all\nnames are devices of direct reference. \nOne important suggestion, adopted by Saul Kripke (1973 [2013]), Peter\nInwagen (1977, 1983, 2000, 2003), Nathan Salmon (1998), David Braun\n(1993, 2005), and Amie Thomasson (1999, 2003, 2009), among others, is\nthat seemingly empty names like ‘Ronald McDonald’ refer to\nexistent, albeit abstract, fictional characters. Fictional characters\nhave both being and existence. (For a powerful critique of this form\nof fictional realism, see Hofweber 2000.) As we don’t run into\nthem on the street, see them on the bus, or feel them in our beds,\ngiven their lack of spatiotemporal location, it is plausible that what\na speaker means when she utters the sentence ‘Ronald\nMcDonald does not exist’ is not the false proposition that that\nsentence expresses but instead the true proposition that (the\nfictional character) Ronald McDonald is not a real person or is not\nconcrete. Indeed, this is suggested by the natural amendment,\n‘‘Ronald McDonald does not exist; he’s a creation of\nadvertisement!’’ On this view, then, there are no\ngenuinely true singular negative existentials. All meaningful singular\nexistentials are true and their negations false. We mistakenly take\nsome singular negative existentials to be true because we conflate or\ndo not sharply distinguish existing from being concrete. The benefit\nof this account is the simple semantics of proper names and the sparse\nmetaphysics. The cost is revisionism regarding what we mean when we\nuse apparently true singular negative existentials. \nWe conclude this section by briefly discussing issues that arise with\nthe interaction between quantifiers, tense and modal operators, and a\nuniversal, first-order existence predicate, as this interaction is the\nsource of another important cost of the account of existence being\noutlined in this section. There are two sets of intuitions that seem\nto pull in opposite directions.  The first concerns the transience and\ncontingency of existence. Things seem to come in and go out of\nexistence through time. While Plato and Descartes used to exist, they\nno longer do; when Plato existed, Descartes did not yet exist; and\nright now the first child to be born in 2150 does not exist, but that\nindividual will. So, it seems, different things exist at different\ntimes. Likewise, of the things that in fact exist, it seems that some\nof them might not have existed at all and different\nthings—things that in fact do not exist—might have existed\ninstead or in addition. So, it seems, different things exist at\ndifferent worlds. These intuitions are quite robust. The second set of\nintuitions concern the ontological status of nonactual and nonpresent\nobjects. Many philosophers are drawn to the thesis of actualism: The\nthesis that absolutely everything is actual and how an object is\nsimpliciter is how it actually is, unactualized possibilities\nfor an object being in some sense hypothetical ways of being for that\nobject. While less popular, many philosophers accept the temporal\nanalog of actualism, the thesis of presentism, according to which\nabsolutely everything is present and how an object is\nsimpliciter is how it presently is, how an object was and\nwill be are in some sense hypothetical ways of being for that object.\nThese two sets of intuitions combined with the view of existence under\nconsideration in this section lead to difficulties. \nLet’s begin with the modal problem. There could have been an\nobject distinct from all actually existing objects. For example, I\ncould have had a brother and, given origin essentialism, if I had a\nbrother, he would have been distinct from every actually existing\nobjects, as no actually existing thing could have been my brother. Our\nintuitions concerning how things might have been lead us to accept\nthis claim as true. But, by the thesis of actualism, absolutely\neverything is actual and, by our view of existence, exists and so\nactually exists. So, it seems that actualism and our view of existence\nare incompatible with the intuitive possibility of there being an\nobject distinct from all existing objects and the intuition that I\nmight have had a brother. \nWe can regiment the contingency of existence intuition as followings,\nletting A be the actuality operator,\nwhere Aφ is true with respect to a\nworld w under an interpretation I\njust in case φ is true with respect to the distinguished world of\nI: \n◊∃x¬A∃y(y=x).\nCall this\nsentence Alien. The worry is that the truth of Alien carries\nontological commitment to merely possible individuals and so the\nfalsity of the thesis of actualism. One way to substantiate this worry\nis to invoke the Barcan Formula, or one of the mixing axioms proposed\nfor modal operators and quantifiers in Ruth Barcan Marcus’s\ngroundbreaking work in quantified modal logic [Marcus 1946], according\nto which all instances of the sentence\n◊∃xφ(x)\n→∃x◊φ(x) are logical true. (In the\nforegoing formulas, φ(x) stands for any formula in which\nthe variable x may or may not be free.) We can then transpose\nthe modal and quantifier in Alien to derive\n∃x◊¬A∃y(y=x).\nThe truth\nof this second sentence evidently requires that there is something\nthat is not actual, contrary to the dictates of actualism. The Barcan\nFormula, and in part for this very reason, is controversial and\nrejected by those that subscribe to a varying domains possible worlds\nsemantics for modal discourse. So this line of argument is not likely\nto convince everyone that our modal intuitions lead to problems.  \nThe Barcan Formula is controversial. There is, however, a second line\nof argument that does not rest on the validity of the Barcan Formula,\nrelying instead on combining standard truth definitions for quantified\nand modal sentences in the most straightforward way. Alien is true\nunder an interpretation\nI just in case there is a world w\naccessible from the distinguished world of I with an\nobject in its domain that is not in the domain of the distinguished\nworld of I. This is because its truth requires that\n∃x¬A∃y(y=x)\nis true\nwith respect to w and so, it is tempting to conclude,\nthat there is a witness that satisfies the condition ¬A∃y(y=x)\nat\nw. But that is the rub. If actualism is true, then\nthere is no such witness, even if there could have been. If we are\nrealistic about possible worlds semantics, the model theory for modal\ntalk itself does not contain primitive modality, instead containing\nworlds as points of evaluation and the notion of truth at a world, in\nwhich case ‘there is’ in the above truth recursion does\nnot occur inside the scope of a possibility operator. So, if Alien is\ntrue, there is some object o and accessible possible\nworld w such that o satisfies\n¬A∃y(y=x)\nat w, which seems to run contrary to the thesis of\nactualism, as that witness does not actually exist. (For further\ndiscussion of this problem and some of the solutions considered below,\nsee the entry on\n actualism.) \nOne solution is to abandon actualism and accept that there are merely\npossible objects. According to this possibilist position, merely\npossible objects are among the most unrestricted domain of\nquantification, being constituents of fundamental reality. While this\nposition deserves serious consideration, let us set it aside and\nexplore only actualist solutions. (The position is structurally\nsimilar to the Meinongian position, as the most inclusive domain of\nquantification, where there is in the most inclusive and unrestricted\nof senses, includes entities that do not actually exist, even if they\nexist simplicter.) A second solution rests on the Meinongian\ndistinction between being, in the sense of being a member of the most\ninclusive domain of quantification and discourse, and existing and the\nclaim that there are objects that do not exist. Armed with a\nMeinongian metaphysics, we can reject Alien as capturing the intuition\nthat existence is contingent, opting instead for the\nfollowing sentence as doing that, where E!x is the\nMeinongian logically primitive existence predicate:\n∃x(¬E!x ∧ ◊E!x).\nThe Meinongian can then deny Alien and appeal to the truth of this\nsentence to explain our intuitions concerning the contingency of\nexistence. Everything is actual, on this view, although some of those\nactual things do not exist but could have, even though they all have\nbeing and the domain of being is fixed across all possible\nworlds. This solution to our problems, however, is unavailable to a\nproponent of the view that existence is a universal property of\nindividuals. \nBernard Linsky and Edward Zalta [Linsky and Zalta 1994] present a\nnovel solution to this problem that promises to be consistent with the\ntenets of the view of existence under consideration in this section.\n(A similar account is defended by Timothy Williamson [Williamson 1998,\n1999a [2000], 1999b, 2000, 2002, 2013]. For a very interesting\ndiscussion of Williamson, see [Goodman 2016].) Consider the intuitive\npossibility that I have a brother. An entity that encodes the property\nof being my brother actually exists, but as a nonconcrete object. That\nobject is only contingently nonconcrete; it could have been concrete,\nand had it been concrete, it would have exemplified the property of\nbeing my brother (along with the other properties that it encodes and\nthe necessary consequences thereof). On this view, my possible brother\n(as well as any alleged merely possible object) actually exists, but\nas a nonconcrete individual that could have been concrete. The view is\nboth actualist, as absolutely everything is actual, and\nanti-Meinongian, as absolutely everything exists. Note, however, that\nAlien, the sentence two paragraphs above purported to capture our\nintuitions concerning the contingency of existence, is false on this\nview, as every individual is a necessary existent.  Instead, our\nintuition that what there is is contingent is to be explained in terms\nof the contingency of what is concrete and nonconcrete. So,\nwhere C!x is a logically primitive predicate of\nconcreteness, it is the truth of the following sentence, not Alien,\nthat explains those intuitions: ∃x(¬C!x\n∧ ◊C!x).  While the explanation of the\ncontingency of existence bears a structural similarity to the\nMeinongian explanation discussed in the previous paragraph, the\nmetaphysics is importantly different and so the two views should not\nbe collapsed. Linsky and Zalta describe a non-Meinongian, actualist\nview that treats existence as a universal property of individuals. \nLinsky and Zalta’s view entails that concreteness is an\naccidental property, in the sense that the self-same individual that\nis in fact nonconcrete (my possible brother, for example) could have\nbeen concrete and the self-same individual that is in fact concrete\n(both you and me, for example) could have been nonconcrete. Many\nmetaphysicians will reject this on the grounds that concreteness is\ncategorical and an individual does not migrate through categorical\nproperties across modal space. But now consider the temporal analog of\nthe modal issues with existence and concreteness that we have been\nexploring: The problem of temporary existents. While one’s\naccounts of the two problems do not need to swing together (Linsky and\nZalta, for example, do not offer the temporal analog of their account\nof contingent existents), as there are differences between alethic\nmodality and temporality, it is useful to consider them as a pair for\nour purposes.  Intuitively things come in and go out of existence;\nwhat exists at one time does not exist at another. The temporal analog\nof Linsky and Zalta’s view of contingent existents entails that\neverything always exists. What there is and what exists at one time is\nthe same as what is and what exists at any other time; the domain of\nquantification is fixed across all times. What varies from time to\ntime is instead which of those individuals are concrete. Socrates\nstill exists now, although as a nonconcrete individual, who was\nconcrete in 450 BCE, and similarly for the first child to be born in\n2150. This view requires that a thing can survive the change from\nbeing nonconcrete to concrete, which is the explanation of what the\nancients would call generation, and the change from being concrete to\nnonconcrete, which is the explanation of what the ancients would call\ndestruction. On this view, then, seeming substantial changes are\nreally forms of qualitative change: A change in the quality of\nconcreteness. This runs contrary to the common conception that\nconcreteness is necessary and eternal to any object that instantiates\nit, the divide between concrete and nonconcrete individuals marking a\ndivide between categories of being. Many metaphysicians insist that,\njust as one and the same thing cannot go from being an individual to\nbeing a property, so too one and the same thing cannot go from being\nnonconcrete to being concrete. \nWhat are the prospects of a theory according to which existence is a\nuniversal, genuinely contingent and transient property of individuals?\nSuch a view requires that the domain of quantification varies from\nworld to world and time to time, as everything that is exists but\ndifferent individuals exist at different possible worlds and at\ndifferent times, in which case the domain of quantification varies\nfrom world to world and time to time. In that case, Alien from above\nis true. So fault must be found with the earlier argument that the\ntruth of Alien is inconsistent with the thesis of actualism. One\nresponse found in the literature rejects the last step, insisting that\nthere are general claims that could have been true, and so are true at\nsome accessible possible world, without there being specific instances\nof those claims that are true at those accessible worlds. In nonmodal\nenvironments, the quantified sentence ∃xφ(x)\nis true just in case there is some witness o that\nsatisfies the condition φ(x). That condition fails,\nhowever, for quantified sentences true at a merely possible world. The\nmodel theory for a model language—with its space of possible\nworlds and individuals populating the domains of possible\nworlds—contains, like everything else if actualism is true, only\nactually existing entities. Still, sentences like Alien are true and\nso there are merely possible worlds at which\n∃x¬A∃y(y=x)\nis true.  There is no individual of which\n¬A∃y(y=x)\nis true in virtue of which the quantified sentence is true, although\nthere would have been had that merely possible world been actual. This\nis perhaps more clear when we turn from sentences being true with\nrespect to merely possible worlds to propositions being true at merely\npossible worlds. There is a world w at which the\nexistential proposition [there is something such that there is no\nactual thing identical to it] is true but there is no singular\nproposition [there is no actual thing identical to o]\ntrue at w as there is no such\nentity o. Had\nw been actual, however, then there would have been\nsuch an entity and it is this fact that grounds the truth of the\nexistential proposition at w. (The classic source for\nthis distinction is [Adams 1981]. See also [Fine 1985] and [Fitch\n1996].)  This suggestion, then, runs contrary to the standard\nsemantics for quantificational sentences, which reduces the truth or\nfalsity of existential and universal sentences to the truth or falsity\nof their instances, when extending that semantics to truth at a\nworld. The suggestion also requires a distinction between truth at a\nworld, in terms of which the model theory for modal operators is\ngiven, and truth in a world, which involves the notion of considering\nwhat would have been had a nonactual world been actual. (For more on\nthis distinction and the problem of the contingency of existence more\ngenerally, see the entry\non actualism.)  \nThis entry began by noting that existence raises a number of deep and\nimportant problems in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and\nphilosophical logic. The entry has examined some of those problems and\nsurveyed a number of different accounts of existence. None of the\ntheories surveyed is wholly satisfying and without cost. The first\nview proposed by Frege and Russell treats existence as a second-order\nproperty and assimilates seemingly singular existentials to general\nexistentials.  The proposal requires descriptivism, the thesis that\nordinary proper names have descriptive equivalences, which many find\nto be a problematic thesis. The second Meinongian view requires\ncountenancing individuals that do not exist. We have seen the view\nface challenges in giving coherent and yet informative and compelling\nindividuation principles for nonexistent individuals and all versions\nof the view suffer from the problem of metaphysical\noverpopulation. Finally, the naive view that existence is a universal\nproperty of individuals was presented. That view faced the problem of\nhaving to reject the truth of highly intuitively true singular\nnegative existential sentences like ‘Ronald McDonald does not\nexist’. The view also faces difficulties in properly accounting\nfor the interaction of quantifiers and modal and tense\noperators. Existence remains, then, itself a serious problem in\nphilosophy of language, metaphysics, and logic and one connected to\nsome of the deepest and most important problems in those areas.","contact.mail":"mnelson@ucr.edu","contact.domain":"ucr.edu"}]
