There we learn\nthat Zeno was nearly 40 years old when Socrates was a young man, say\n20. Since Socrates was born in 469 BC we can estimate a birth date for\nZeno around 490 BC. Beyond this, really all we know is that he was\nclose to Parmenides (Plato reports the gossip that they were lovers\nwhen Zeno was young), and that he wrote a book of paradoxes defending\nParmenides’ philosophy. Sadly this book has not survived, and\nwhat we know of his arguments is second-hand, principally through\nAristotle and his commentators (here we draw particularly on\nSimplicius, who, though writing a thousand years after Zeno,\napparently possessed at least some of his book). There were apparently\n40 ‘paradoxes of plurality’, attempting to show that\nontological pluralism—a belief in the existence of many things\nrather than only one—leads to absurd conclusions; of these\nparadoxes only two definitely survive, though a third argument can\nprobably be attributed to Zeno. Aristotle speaks of a further four\narguments against motion (and by extension change generally), all of\nwhich he gives and attempts to refute. In addition Aristotle\nattributes two other paradoxes to Zeno. Sadly again, almost none of\nthese paradoxes are quoted in Zeno’s original words by their\nvarious commentators, but in paraphrase. \n\nBefore we look at the paradoxes themselves it will be useful to sketch\nsome of their historical and logical significance. First, Zeno sought\nto defend Parmenides by attacking his critics. Parmenides rejected\npluralism and the reality of any kind of change: for him all was one\nindivisible, unchanging reality, and any appearances to the contrary\nwere illusions, to be dispelled by reason and revelation. Not\nsurprisingly, this philosophy found many critics, who ridiculed the\nsuggestion; after all it flies in the face of some of our most basic\nbeliefs about the world. (Interestingly, general\nrelativity—particularly quantum general\nrelativity—arguably provides a novel—if novelty\nis possible—argument for the Parmenidean denial of\nchange: Belot and Earman, 2001.) In response to this criticism Zeno\ndid something that may sound obvious, but which had a profound impact\non Greek philosophy that is felt to this day: he attempted to show\nthat equal absurdities followed logically from the denial of\nParmenides’ views. You think that there are many things? Then\nyou must conclude that everything is both infinitely small and\ninfinitely big! You think that motion is infinitely divisible? Then it\nfollows that nothing moves! (This is what a ‘paradox’ is:\na demonstration that a contradiction or absurd consequence follows\nfrom apparently reasonable assumptions.)  \nAs we read the arguments it is crucial to keep this method in mind.\nThey are always directed towards a more-or-less specific target: the\nviews of some person or school. We must bear in mind that the\narguments are ‘ad hominem’ in the literal Latin sense of\nbeing directed ‘at (the views of) persons’, but not\n‘ad hominem’ in the traditional technical sense of\nattacking the (character of the) people who put forward the views\nrather than attacking the views themselves. They work by temporarily\nsupposing ‘for argument’s sake’ that those\nassertions are true, and then arguing that if they are then absurd\nconsequences follow—that nothing moves for example: they are\n‘reductio ad absurdum’ arguments (or\n‘dialectic’ in the sense of the period). Then, if the\nargument is logically valid, and the conclusion genuinely\nunacceptable, the assertions must be false after all. Thus when we\nlook at Zeno’s arguments we must ask two related questions: whom\nor what position is Zeno attacking, and what exactly is assumed for\nargument’s sake? If we find that Zeno makes hidden assumptions\nbeyond what the position under attack commits one to, then the absurd\nconclusion can be avoided by denying one of the hidden assumptions,\nwhile maintaining the position. Indeed commentators at least since\nAristotle have responded to Zeno in this way. \nSo whose views do Zeno’s arguments attack? There is a huge\nliterature debating Zeno’s exact historical target. As we shall\ndiscuss briefly below, some say that the target was a technical\ndoctrine of the Pythagoreans, but most today see Zeno as opposing\ncommon-sense notions of plurality and motion. We shall approach the\nparadoxes in this spirit, and refer the reader to the literature\nconcerning the interpretive debate. \nThat said, it is also the majority opinion that—with certain\nqualifications—Zeno’s paradoxes reveal some problems that\ncannot be resolved without the full resources of mathematics as worked\nout in the Nineteenth century (and perhaps beyond). This is not\n(necessarily) to say that modern mathematics is required to answer any\nof the problems that Zeno explicitly wanted to raise; arguably\nAristotle and other ancients had replies that would—or\nshould—have satisfied Zeno. (Nor shall we make any particular\nclaims about Zeno’s influence on the history of mathematics.)\nHowever, as mathematics developed, and more thought was given to the\nparadoxes, new difficulties arose from them; these difficulties\nrequire modern mathematics for their resolution. These new\ndifficulties arise partly in response to the evolution in our\nunderstanding of what mathematical rigor demands: solutions that would\nsatisfy Zeno’s standards of rigor would not satisfy ours. Thus\nwe shall push several of the paradoxes from their common sense\nformulations to their resolution in modern mathematics. (Another\nqualification: we shall offer resolutions in terms of\n‘standard’ mathematics, but other modern formulations are\nalso capable of dealing with Zeno, and arguably in ways that better\nrepresent his mathematical concepts.) \nThis first argument, given in Zeno’s words according to\nSimplicius, attempts to show that there could not be more than one\nthing, on pain of contradiction: if there are many things, then they\nare both ‘limited’ and ‘unlimited’, a\ncontradiction. On the one hand, he says that any collection must\ncontain some definite number of things, or in his words\n‘neither more nor less’. But if you have a definite number\nof things, he concludes, you must have a\nfinite—‘limited’—number of them; in drawing\nthis inference he assumes that to have infinitely many things is to\nhave an indefinite number of them. On the other hand, imagine\nany collection of ‘many’ things arranged in\nspace—picture them lined up in one dimension for definiteness.\nBetween any two of them, he claims, is a third; and in between these\nthree elements another two; and another four between these five; and\nso on without end. Therefore the collection is also\n‘unlimited’. So our original assumption of a plurality\nleads to a contradiction, and hence is false: there are not many\nthings after all. At least, so Zeno’s reasoning runs. Let us consider the two subarguments, in reverse order. First are\nthere ‘always others between the things that are’? (In\nmodern terminology, why must objects always be ‘densely’\nordered?) Suppose that we had imagined a collection of ten apples\nlined up; then there is indeed another apple between the sixth and\neighth, but there is none between the seventh and eighth! On the\nassumption that Zeno is not simply confused, what does he have in\nmind? The texts do not say, but here are two possibilities: first, one\nmight hold that for any pair of physical objects (two apples say) to\nbe two distinct objects and not just one (a\n‘double-apple’) there must be a third between them,\nphysically separating them, even if it is just air. And one might\nthink that for these three to be distinct, there must be two more\nobjects separating them, and so on (this view presupposes that their\nbeing made of different substances is not sufficient to render them\ndistinct). So perhaps Zeno is arguing against plurality given a\ncertain conception of physical distinctness. But second, one might\nalso hold that any body has parts that can be densely\nordered. Of course 1/2s, 1/4s, 1/8s and so on of apples are not\ndense—such parts may be adjacent—but there may be\nsufficiently small parts—call them\n‘point-parts’—that are. Indeed, if between any two\npoint-parts there lies a finite distance, and if point-parts can be\narbitrarily close, then they are dense; a third lies at the half-way\npoint of any two. In particular, familiar geometric points are like\nthis, and hence are dense. So perhaps Zeno is offering an argument\nregarding the divisibility of bodies. Either way, Zeno’s assumption of\ndenseness requires some further assumption about the plurality in\nquestion, and correspondingly focusses the target of his paradox.\n \nBut suppose that one holds that some collection (the points in a line,\nsay) is dense, hence ‘unlimited’, or infinite. The first\nprong of Zeno’s attack purports to show that because it contains a\ndefinite number of elements it is also ‘limited’, or\nfinite. Can this contradiction be escaped? The assumption that any\ndefinite number is finite seems intuitive, but we now know, thanks to\nthe work of Cantor in the Nineteenth century, how to understand\ninfinite numbers in a way that makes them just as definite as finite\nnumbers. The central element of this theory of the ‘transfinite\nnumbers’ is a precise definition of when two infinite\ncollections are the same size, and when one is bigger than the\nother. With such a definition in hand it is then possible to order the\ninfinite numbers just as the finite numbers are ordered: for example,\nthere are different, definite infinite numbers of fractions and\ngeometric points in a line, even though both are dense. (See Further\nReading below for references to introductions to these mathematical\nideas, and their history.) So contrary to Zeno’s assumption, it is\nmeaningful to compare infinite collections with respect to the number\nof their elements, to say whether two have more than, or fewer than,\nor ‘as many as’ each other: there are, for instance, more\ndecimal numbers than whole numbers, but as many even numbers as whole\nnumbers. So mathematically, Zeno’s reasoning is unsound when he says\nthat because a collection has a definite number, it must be finite,\nand the first subargument is fallacious. (Though of course that only\nshows that infinite collections are mathematically consistent, not\nthat any physically exist.)\n \nBut if it exists, each thing must have some size and thickness, and\npart of it must be apart from the rest. And the same reasoning holds\nconcerning the part that is in front. For that too will have size and\npart of it will be in front. Now it is the same thing to say this once\nand to keep saying it forever. For no such part of it will be last,\nnor will there be one part not related to another. Therefore, if there\nare many things, they must be both small and large; so small as not to\nhave size, but so large as to be unlimited. (Simplicius(a) On\nAristotle’s Physics, 141.2) \nOnce again we have Zeno’s own words. According to his\nconclusion, there are three parts to this argument, but only two\nsurvive. The first—missing—argument purports to show that\nif many things exist then they must have no size at all. Second, from\nthis Zeno argues that it follows that they do not exist at all; since\nthe result of joining (or removing) a sizeless object to anything is\nno change at all, he concludes that the thing added (or removed) is\nliterally nothing. The argument to this point is a self-contained\nrefutation of pluralism, but Zeno goes on to generate a further\nproblem for someone who continues to urge the existence of a\nplurality. This third part of the argument is rather badly put but it\nseems to run something like this: suppose there is a plurality, so\nsome spatially extended object exists (after all, he’s just\nargued that inextended things do not exist). Since it is extended, it\nhas two spatially distinct parts (one ‘in front’ of the\nother). And the parts exist, so they have extension, and so they also\neach have two spatially distinct parts; and so on without end. And\nhence, the final line of argument seems to conclude, the object, if it\nis extended at all, is infinite in extent. \nBut what could justify this final step? It doesn’t seem that\nbecause an object has two parts it must be infinitely big! And neither\ndoes it follow from any other of the divisions that Zeno describes\nhere; four, eight, sixteen, or whatever finite parts make a finite\nwhole. Again, surely Zeno is aware of these facts, and so must have\nsomething else in mind, presumably the following: he assumes that if\nthe infinite series of divisions he describes were repeated infinitely\nmany times then a definite collection of parts would result. And\nnotice that he doesn’t have to assume that anyone could actually\ncarry out the divisions—there’s not enough time and knives\naren’t sharp enough—just that an object can be\ngeometrically decomposed into such parts (neither does he assume that\nthese parts are what we would naturally categorize as distinct\nphysical objects like apples, cells, molecules, electrons or so on,\nbut only that they are geometric parts of these objects). Now,\nif—as a pluralist might well accept—such parts exist, it\nfollows from the second part of his argument that they are extended,\nand, he apparently assumes, an infinite sum of finite parts is\ninfinite. \nHere we should note that there are two ways he may be envisioning the\nresult of the infinite division. \nFirst, one could read him as first dividing the object into 1/2s, then\none of the 1/2s—say the second—into two 1/4s, then one of\nthe 1/4s—say the second again—into two 1/8s and so on. In\nthis case the result of the infinite division results in an endless\nsequence of pieces of size 1/2 the total length, 1/4 the length, 1/8\nthe length …. And then so the total length is (1/2 + 1/4\n+ 1/8 + … of the length, which Zeno concludes is an infinite\ndistance, so that the pluralist is committed to the absurdity that\nfinite bodies are ‘so large as to be unlimited’. \nWhat is often pointed out in response is that Zeno gives us no reason\nto think that the sum is infinite rather than finite. He might have\nhad the intuition that any infinite sum of finite quantities, since it\ngrows endlessly with each new term must be infinite, but one might\nalso take this kind of example as showing that some infinite sums are\nafter all finite. Thus, contrary to what he thought, Zeno has not\nproven that the absurd conclusion follows. However, what is not always\nappreciated is that the pluralist is not off the hook so easily, for\nit is not enough just to say that the sum might be finite,\nshe must also show that it is finite—otherwise we\nremain uncertain about the tenability of her position. As an\nillustration of the difficulty faced here consider the following: many\ncommentators speak as if it is simply obvious that the infinite sum of\nthe fractions is 1, that there is nothing to infinite summation. But\nwhat about the following sum: \\(1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1\n-\\ldots\\). Obviously, it seems, the sum can be rewritten \\((1 - 1) +\n(1 - 1) + \\ldots = 0 + 0 + \\ldots = 0\\). Surely this answer seems as\nintuitive as the sum of fractions. But this sum can also be rewritten\n\\(1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 +\\ldots) = 1 - 0\\)—since we’ve just\nshown that the term in parentheses vanishes—\\(= 1\\). Relying on\nintuitions about how to perform infinite sums leads to the conclusion\nthat \\(1 = 0\\). Until one can give a theory of infinite sums that can\ngive a satisfactory answer to any problem, one cannot say that\nZeno’s infinite sum is obviously finite. Such a theory was not\nfully worked out until the Nineteenth century by Cauchy. (In\nCauchy’s system \\(1/2 + 1/4 + \\ldots = 1\\) but \\(1 - 1 + 1\n-\\ldots\\) is undefined.) \nSecond, it could be that Zeno means that the object is divided in\nhalf, then both the 1/2s are both divided in half, then the 1/4s are\nall divided in half and so on. In this case the pieces at any\nparticular stage are all the same finite size, and so one could\nconclude that the result of carrying on the procedure infinitely would\nbe pieces the same size, which if they exist—according to\nZeno—is greater than zero; but an infinity of equal\nextended parts is indeed infinitely big. \nBut this line of thought can be resisted. First, suppose that the\nprocedure just described completely divides the object into\nnon-overlapping parts. (There is a problem with this supposition that\nwe will see just below.) It involves doubling the number of pieces\nafter every division and so after \\(N\\) divisions there are\n\\(2^N\\) pieces. But it turns out that for any natural\nor infinite number, \\(N\\), \\(2^N \\gt N\\), and so the number of (supposed) parts obtained by the\ninfinity of divisions described is an even larger infinity. This\nresult poses no immediate difficulty since, as we mentioned above,\ninfinities come in different sizes. The number of times everything is\ndivided in two is said to be ‘countably infinite’: there\nis a countable infinity of things in a collection if they can be\nlabeled by the numbers 1, 2, 3, … without remainder on either\nside. But the number of pieces the infinite division produces is\n‘uncountably infinite’, which means that there is no way\nto label them 1, 2, 3, … without missing some of them—in\nfact infinitely many of them. However, Cauchy’s definition of an\ninfinite sum only applies to countably infinite series of numbers, and\nso does not apply to the pieces we are considering. However, we could\nconsider just countably many of them, whose lengths according to\nZeno—since he claims they are all equal and non-zero—will\nsum to an infinite length; the length of all of the pieces\ncould not be less than this. \nAt this point the pluralist who believes that Zeno’s division\ncompletely divides objects into non-overlapping parts (see the next\nparagraph) could respond that the parts in fact have no extension,\neven though they exist. That would block the conclusion that finite\nobjects are infinite, but it seems to push her back to the other horn\nof Zeno’s argument, for how can all these zero length pieces\nmake up a non-zero sized whole? (Note that according to Cauchy \\(0 + 0\n+ 0 + \\ldots = 0\\) but this result shows nothing here, for as we saw\nthere are uncountably many pieces to add up—more than are added\nin this sum.) We shall postpone this question for the discussion of\nthe next paradox, where it comes up explicitly. \nThe second problem with interpreting the infinite division as a\nrepeated division of all parts is that it does not divide an object\ninto distinct parts, if objects are composed in the natural way. To\nsee this, let’s ask the question of what parts are obtained by\nthis division into 1/2s, 1/4s, 1/8s, …. Since the division is\nrepeated without end there is no last piece we can give as an answer,\nand so we need to think about the question in a different way. If we\nsuppose that an object can be represented by a line segment of unit\nlength, then the division produces collections of segments, where the\nfirst is either the first or second half of the whole segment, the\nsecond is the first or second quarter, or third or fourth quarter, and\nin general the segment produced by \\(N\\) divisions is either the\nfirst or second half of the previous segment. For instance, writing\nthe segment with endpoints \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as\n\\([a,b]\\), some of these collections (technically known\nas ‘chains’ since the elements of the collection are\nordered by size) would start \\(\\{[0,1], [0,1/2], [1/4,1/2], [1/4,3/8],\n\\ldots \\}\\). (When we argued before that Zeno’s division produced\nuncountably many pieces of the object, what we should have said more\ncarefully is that it produces uncountably many chains like this.) \nThe question of which parts the division picks out is then the\nquestion of which part any given chain picks out; it’s natural\nto say that a chain picks out the part of the line which is contained\nin every one of its elements. Consider for instance the chain\n\\(\\{[0,1/2], [1/4,1/2], [3/8,1/2], \\ldots \\}\\), in other words the chain\nthat starts with the left half of the line and for which every other\nelement is the right half of the previous one. The half-way point is\nin every one of the segments in this chain; it’s the right-hand\nendpoint of each one. But no other point is in all its elements:\nclearly no point beyond half-way is; and pick any point \\(p\\)\nbefore half-way, if you take right halves of [0,1/2] enough times, the\nleft-hand end of the segment will be to the right of \\(p\\). Thus\nthe only part of the line that is in all the elements of this chain is\nthe half-way point, and so that is the part of the line picked out by\nthe chain. (In fact, it follows from a postulate of number theory that\nthere is exactly one point that all the members of any such a\nchain have in common.) The problem is that by parallel reasoning, the\nhalf-way point is also picked out by the distinct chain \\(\\{[1/2,1],\n[1/2,3/4], [1/2,5/8], \\ldots \\}\\), where each segment after the first is\nthe left half of the preceding one. And so both chains pick out the\nsame piece of the line: the half-way point. And so on for many other\npairs of chains. Thus Zeno’s argument, interpreted in terms of a\nrepeated division of all parts into half, doesn’t\ndivide the line into distinct parts. Hence, if we think that objects\nare composed in the same way as the line, it follows that despite\nappearances, this version of the argument does not cut objects into\nparts whose total size we can properly discuss. \n(You might think that this problem could be fixed by taking the\nelements of the chains to be segments with no endpoint to the right.\nThen the first of the two chains we considered no longer has the\nhalf-way point in any of its segments, and so does not pick out that\npoint. The problem now is that it fails to pick out any part of the\nline: the previous reasoning showed that it doesn’t pick out any\npoint greater than or less than the half-way point, and now it\ndoesn’t pick out that point either!) \nWhat then will remain? A magnitude? No: that is impossible, since then\nthere will be something not divided, whereas ex hypothesi the\nbody was divisible through and through. But if it be admitted\nthat neither a body nor a magnitude will remain … the body will\neither consist of points (and its constituents will be\nwithout magnitude) or it will be absolutely nothing. If the\nlatter, then it might both come-to-be out of nothing and exist as a\ncomposite of nothing; and thus presumably the whole body will be\nnothing but an appearance. But if it consists of points, it will not\npossess any magnitude. (Aristotle On Generation and\nCorruption, 316a19) \nThese words are Aristotle’s not Zeno’s, and indeed the\nargument is not even attributed to Zeno by Aristotle. However we have\nSimplicius’ opinion ((a) On Aristotle’s Physics,\n139.24) that it originates with Zeno, which is why it is included\nhere. Aristotle begins by hypothesizing that some body is completely\ndivisible, ‘through and through’; the second step of the\nargument makes clear that he means by this that it is divisible into\nparts that themselves have no size—parts with any magnitude\nremain incompletely divided. (Once again what matters is that the body\nis genuinely composed of such parts, not that anyone has the time and\ntools to make the division; and remembering from the previous section\nthat one does not obtain such parts by repeatedly dividing all parts\nin half.) So suppose the body is divided into its dimensionless parts.\nThese parts could either be nothing at all—as Zeno argued\nabove—or ‘point-parts’. If the parts are nothing\nthen so is the body: it’s just an illusion. And, the argument\nconcludes, even if they are points, since these are unextended the\nbody itself will be unextended: surely any sum—even an infinite\none—of zeroes is zero. \nCould that final assumption be questioned? It is (as noted above) a\nconsequence of the Cauchy definition of an infinite sum; however\nGrünbaum (1967) pointed out that that definition only applies to\ncountable sums, and Cantor gave a beautiful, astounding and extremely\ninfluential ‘diagonal’ proof that the number of points in\nthe segment is uncountably infinite. There is no way to label\nall the points in the line with the infinity of numbers 1, 2,\n3, … , and so there are more points in a line segment than\nsummands in a Cauchy sum. In short, the analysis employed for\ncountably infinite division does not apply here. \nSo suppose that you are just given the number of points in a line and\nthat their lengths are all zero; how would you determine the length?\nDo we need a new definition, one that extends Cauchy’s to\nuncountably infinite sums? It turns out that that would not help,\nbecause Cauchy further showed that any segment, of any length\nwhatsoever (and indeed an entire infinite line) have exactly the\nsame number of points as our unit segment. So knowing the number\nof points won’t determine the length of the line, and so nothing\nlike familiar addition—in which the whole is determined by the\nparts—is possible. Instead we must think of the distance\nproperties of a line as logically posterior to its point composition:\nfirst we have a set of points (ordered in a certain way, so\nthat there is some fact, for example, about which of any three is\nbetween the others) then we define a function of pairs of\npoints which specifies how far apart they are (satisfying such\nconditions as that the distance between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) plus\nthe distance between \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) equals the distance\nbetween \\(A\\) and \\(C\\)—if \\(B\\) is between\n\\(A\\) and \\(C)\\). Thus we answer Zeno as follows: the\nargument assumed that the size of the body was a sum of the sizes of\npoint parts, but that is not the case; according to modern\nmathematics, a geometric line segment is an uncountable infinity of\npoints plus a distance function. (Note that Grünbaum used the\nfact that the point composition fails to determine a length to support\nhis ‘conventionalist’ view that a line has no determinate\nlength at all, independent of a standard of measurement.) \nAs Ehrlich (2014) emphasizes, we could even stipulate that an\n‘uncountable sum’ of zeroes is zero, because the length of\na line is not equal to the sum of the lengths of the points it\ncontains (addressing Sherry’s, 1988, concern that refusing to\nextend the definition would be ad hoc). Hence, if one stipulates that\nthe length of a line is the sum of any complete collection of proper\nparts, then it follows that points are not properly speaking\nparts of a line (unlike halves, quarters, and so on of a line).\nIn a strict sense in modern measure theory (which generalizes\nGrünbaum’s framework), the points in a line are\nincommensurable with it, and the very set-up given by Aristotle in\nwhich the length of the whole is analyzed in terms of its points is\nillegitimate.  \nThis paradox is known as the ‘dichotomy’ because it\ninvolves repeated division into two (like the second paradox of\nplurality). Like the other paradoxes of motion we have it from\nAristotle, who sought to refute it. \nSuppose a very fast runner—such as mythical Atalanta—needs\nto run for the bus. Clearly before she reaches the bus stop she must\nrun half-way, as Aristotle says. There’s no problem there;\nsupposing a constant motion it will take her 1/2 the time to run\nhalf-way there and 1/2 the time to run the rest of the way. Now she\nmust also run half-way to the half-way point—i.e., a 1/4 of the\ntotal distance—before she reaches the half-way point, but again\nshe is left with a finite number of finite lengths to run, and plenty\nof time to do it. And before she reaches 1/4 of the way she must reach\n\\(1/2\\) of \\(1/4 = 1/8\\) of the way; and before that a 1/16; and so on. There\nis no problem at any finite point in this series, but what if the\nhalving is carried out infinitely many times? The resulting series\ncontains no first distance to run, for any possible first distance\ncould be divided in half, and hence would not be first after all.\nHowever it does contain a final distance, namely 1/2 of the way; and a\npenultimate distance, 1/4 of the way; and a third to last distance,\n1/8 of the way; and so on. Thus the series of distances that Atalanta\nis required to run is: …, then 1/16 of the way, then 1/8 of the\nway, then 1/4 of the way, and finally 1/2 of the way (for now we are\nnot suggesting that she stops at the end of each segment and\nthen starts running at the beginning of the next—we are thinking\nof her continuous run being composed of such parts). And now there is\na problem, for this description of her run has her travelling an\ninfinite number of finite distances, which, Zeno\nwould have us conclude, must take an infinite time, which is to say it\nis never completed. And since the argument does not depend on the\ndistance or who or what the mover is, it follows that no finite\ndistance can ever be traveled, which is to say that all motion is\nimpossible. (Note that the paradox could easily be generated in the\nother direction so that Atalanta must first run half way, then half\nthe remaining way, then half of that and so on, so that she must run\nthe following endless sequence of fractions of the total distance:\n1/2, then 1/4, then 1/8, then ….) \nA couple of common responses are not adequate. One might—as\nSimplicius ((a) On Aristotle’s Physics, 1012.22) tells\nus Diogenes the Cynic did by silently standing and walking—point\nout that it is a matter of the most common experience that things in\nfact do move, and that we know very well that Atalanta would have no\ntrouble reaching her bus stop. But this would not impress Zeno, who,\nas a paid up Parmenidean, held that many things are not as they\nappear: it may appear that Diogenes is walking or that Atalanta is\nrunning, but appearances can be deceptive and surely we have a logical\nproof that they are in fact not moving at all. Alternatively if one\ndoesn’t accept that Zeno has given a proof that motion is\nillusory—as we hopefully do not—one then owes an account\nof what is wrong with his argument: he has given reasons why motion is\nimpossible, and so an adequate response must show why those reasons\nare not sufficient. And it won’t do simply to point out that\nthere are some ways of cutting up Atalanta’s run—into just\ntwo halves, say—in which there is no problem. For if you accept\nall of the steps in Zeno’s argument then you must accept his\nconclusion (assuming that he has reasoned in a logically deductive\nway): it’s not enough to show an unproblematic division, you\nmust also show why the given division is unproblematic. \nAnother response—given by Aristotle himself—is to point\nout that as we divide the distances run, we should also divide the\ntotal time taken: there is 1/2 the time for the final 1/2, a 1/4 of\nthe time for the previous 1/4, an 1/8 of the time for the 1/8 of the\nrun and so on. Thus each fractional distance has just the right\nfraction of the finite total time for Atalanta to complete it, and\nthus the distance can be completed in a finite time. Aristotle felt\nthat this reply should satisfy Zeno, however he also realized\n(Physics, 263a15) that it could not be the end of the matter.\nFor now we are saying that the time Atalanta takes to reach\nthe bus stop is composed of an infinite number of finite\npieces—…, 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 of the total time—and\nisn’t that an infinite time? \nOf course, one could again claim that some infinite sums have finite\ntotals, and in particular that the sum of these pieces is \\(1 \\times\\)\nthe total time, which is of course finite (and again a complete\nsolution would demand a rigorous account of infinite summation, like\nCauchy’s). However, Aristotle did not make such a move. Instead\nhe drew a sharp distinction between what he termed a\n‘continuous’ line and a line divided into parts. Consider\na simple division of a line into two: on the one hand there is the\nundivided line, and on the other the line with a mid-point selected as\nthe boundary of the two halves. Aristotle claims that these are two\ndistinct things: and that the latter is only ‘potentially’\nderivable from the former. Next, Aristotle takes the common-sense view\nthat time is like a geometric line, and considers the time it takes to\ncomplete the run. We can again distinguish the two cases: there is the\ncontinuous interval from start to finish, and there is the interval\ndivided into Zeno’s infinity of half-runs. The former is\n‘potentially infinite’ in the sense that it could be\ndivided into the latter ‘actual infinity’. Here’s\nthe crucial step: Aristotle thinks that since these intervals are\ngeometrically distinct they must be physically\ndistinct. But how could that be? He claims that the runner must do\nsomething at the end of each half-run to make it distinct from the\nnext: she must stop, making the run itself discontinuous. (It’s\nnot clear why some other action wouldn’t suffice to divide the\ninterval.) Then Aristotle’s full answer to the paradox is that\nthe question of whether the infinite series of runs is possible or not\nis ambiguous: the potentially infinite series of halves in a\ncontinuous run is possible, while an actual infinity of discontinuous\nhalf runs is not—Zeno does identify an impossibility, but it\ndoes not describe the usual way of running down tracks! \nIt is hard—from our modern perspective perhaps—to see how\nthis answer could be completely satisfactory. In the first place it\nassumes that a clear distinction can be drawn between potential and\nactual infinities, something that was never fully achieved. Second,\nsuppose that Zeno’s problem turns on the claim that infinite\nsums of finite quantities are invariably infinite. Then\nAristotle’s distinction will only help if he can explain why\npotentially infinite sums are in fact finite (couldn’t we\npotentially add \\(1 + 1 + 1 +\\ldots\\), which does not have a finite\ntotal); or if he can give a reason why potentially infinite sums just\ndon’t exist. Or perhaps Aristotle did not see infinite sums as\nthe problem, but rather whether completing an infinity of finite\nactions is metaphysically and conceptually and physically possible. We\nwill briefly discuss this issue—of\n‘Supertasks’—below, but note that there is a\nwell-defined run in which the stages of Atalanta’s run are\npunctuated by finite rests, arguably showing the possibility of\ncompleting an infinite series of finite tasks in a finite time\n(Huggett 2010, 21–2). Finally, the distinction between potential and\nactual infinities has played no role in mathematics since Cantor tamed\nthe transfinite numbers—certainly the potential infinite has\nplayed no role in the modern mathematical solutions discussed\nhere. \nThis paradox turns on much the same considerations as the last.\nImagine Achilles chasing a tortoise, and suppose that Achilles is\nrunning at 1 m/s, that the tortoise is crawling at 0.1\nm/s and that the tortoise starts out 0.9m ahead of\nAchilles. On the face of it Achilles should catch the tortoise after\n1s, at a distance of 1m from where he starts (and so\n0.1m from where the Tortoise starts). We could break\nAchilles’ motion up as we did Atalanta’s, into halves, or\nwe could do it as follows: before Achilles can catch the tortoise he\nmust reach the point where the tortoise started. But in the time he\ntakes to do this the tortoise crawls a little further forward. So next\nAchilles must reach this new point. But in the time it takes Achilles\nto achieve this the tortoise crawls forward a tiny bit further. And so\non to infinity: every time that Achilles reaches the place where the\ntortoise was, the tortoise has had enough time to get a little bit\nfurther, and so Achilles has another run to make, and so Achilles has\nan infinite number of finite catch-ups to do before he can catch the\ntortoise, and so, Zeno concludes, he never catches the tortoise. \nOne aspect of the paradox is thus that Achilles must traverse the\nfollowing infinite series of distances before he catches the tortoise:\nfirst 0.9m, then an additional 0.09m, then\n0.009m, …. These are the series of distances\nahead that the tortoise reaches at the start of each of\nAchilles’ catch-ups. Looked at this way the puzzle is identical\nto the Dichotomy, for it is just to say that ‘that which is in\nlocomotion must arrive [nine tenths of the way] before it arrives at\nthe goal’. And so everything we said above applies here too. \nBut what the paradox in this form brings out most vividly is the\nproblem of completing a series of actions that has no final\nmember—in this case the infinite series of catch-ups before\nAchilles reaches the tortoise. But just what is the problem? Perhaps\nthe following: Achilles’ run to the point at which he should\nreach the tortoise can, it seems, be completely decomposed into the\nseries of catch-ups, none of which take him to the tortoise.\nTherefore, nowhere in his run does he reach the tortoise after all.\nBut if this is what Zeno had in mind it won’t do. Of course\nAchilles doesn’t reach the tortoise at any point of the\nsequence, for every run in the sequence occurs before we\nexpect Achilles to reach it! Thinking in terms of the points that\nAchilles must reach in his run, 1m does not occur in the sequence\n0.9m, 0.99m, 0.999m, …, so of\ncourse he never catches the tortoise during that sequence of runs!\n(And the same situation arises in the Dichotomy: no first distance in\nthe series, so it does not contain Atalanta’s start!) Thus the series\nof catch-ups does not after all completely decompose the run: the\nfinal point—at which Achilles does catch the tortoise—must\nbe added to it. So is there any puzzle? Arguably yes.\n \nAchilles’ run passes through the sequence of points 0.9m, 0.99m,\n0.999m, …, 1m. But does such a strange\nsequence—comprised of an infinity of members followed by one\nmore—make sense mathematically? If not then our mathematical\ndescription of the run cannot be correct, but then what is?\nFortunately the theory of transfinites pioneered by Cantor assures us\nthat such a series is perfectly respectable. It was realized that the\norder properties of infinite series are much more elaborate than those\nof finite series.  Any way of arranging the numbers 1, 2 and 3 gives a\nseries in the same pattern, for instance, but there are many distinct\nways to order the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, … for instance. Or\n… , 3, 2, 1. Or … , 4, 2, 1, 3, 5,\n…. Or 2, 3, 4, … , 1, which is just the same\nkind of series as the positions Achilles must run through. Thus the\ntheory of the transfinites treats not just ‘cardinal’\nnumbers—which depend only on how many things there are—but\nalso ‘ordinal’ numbers which depend further on how the\nthings are arranged. Since the ordinals are standardly taken to be\nmathematically legitimate numbers, and since the series of points\nAchilles must pass has an ordinal number, we shall take it that the\nseries is mathematically legitimate. (Again, see\n‘Supertasks’ below for another kind of problem that might\narise for Achilles’.) \nZeno abolishes motion, saying “What is in motion moves neither\nin the place it is nor in one in which it is not”. (Diogenes\nLaertius Lives of Famous Philosophers, ix.72) \nThis argument against motion explicitly turns on a particular kind of\nassumption of plurality: that time is composed of moments (or\n‘nows’) and nothing else. Consider an arrow,\napparently in motion, at any instant. First, Zeno assumes that it\ntravels no distance during that moment—‘it occupies an\nequal space’ for the whole instant. But the entire period of its\nmotion contains only instants, all of which contain an arrow at rest,\nand so, Zeno concludes, the arrow cannot be moving. \nAn immediate concern is why Zeno is justified in assuming that the\narrow is at rest during any instant. It follows immediately if one\nassumes that an instant lasts 0s: whatever speed the arrow has, it\nwill get nowhere if it has no time at all. But what if one held that\nthe smallest parts of time are finite—if tiny—so that a\nmoving arrow might actually move some distance during an instant? One\nway of supporting the assumption—which requires reading quite a\nlot into the text—starts by assuming that instants are\nindivisible. Then suppose that an arrow actually moved during an\ninstant. It would be at different locations at the start and end of\nthe instant, which implies that the instant has a ‘start’\nand an ‘end’, which in turn implies that it has at least\ntwo parts, and so is divisible, contrary to our assumption. (Note that\nthis argument only establishes that nothing can move during an\ninstant, not that instants cannot be finite.) \nSo then, nothing moves during any instant, but time is entirely\ncomposed of instants, so nothing ever moves. A first response is to\npoint out that determining the velocity of the arrow means dividing\nthe distance traveled in some time by the length of that time.\nBut—assuming from now on that instants have zero\nduration—this formula makes no sense in the case of an instant:\nthe arrow travels 0m in the 0s the instant lasts,\nbut 0/0 m/s is not any number at all. Thus it is fallacious\nto conclude from the fact that the arrow doesn’t travel any\ndistance in an instant that it is at rest; whether it is in motion at\nan instant or not depends on whether it travels any distance in a\nfinite interval that includes the instant in question. \nThe answer is correct, but it carries the counter-intuitive\nimplication that motion is not something that happens at any instant,\nbut rather only over finite periods of time. Think about it this way:\ntime, as we said, is composed only of instants. No distance is\ntraveled during any instant. So when does the arrow actually move? How\ndoes it get from one place to another at a later moment? There’s\nonly one answer: the arrow gets from point \\(X\\) at time 1 to\npoint \\(Y\\) at time 2 simply in virtue of being at successive\nintermediate points at successive intermediate times—the arrow\nnever changes its position during an instant but only over intervals\ncomposed of instants, by the occupation of different positions at\ndifferent times. In Bergson’s memorable words—which he\nthought expressed an absurdity—‘movement is composed of\nimmobilities’ (1911, 308): getting from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\)\nis a matter of occupying exactly one place in between at each instant\n(in the right order of course). For further discussion of this\n‘at-at’ conception of time see Arntzenius (2000) and\nSalmon (2001, 23-4). \nAristotle goes on to elaborate and refute an argument for Zeno’s\nfinal paradox of motion. The text is rather cryptic, but is usually\ninterpreted along the following lines: picture three sets of touching\ncubes—all exactly the same—in relative motion. One\nset—the \\(A\\)s—are at rest, and the others—the\n\\(B\\)s and \\(C\\)s—move to the right and left\nrespectively, at a constant equal speed. And suppose that at some\nmoment the rightmost \\(B\\) and the leftmost \\(C\\) are\naligned with the middle \\(A\\), as shown (three of each are\npictured for simplicity).  \nSince the \\(B\\)s and \\(C\\)s move at same speeds, they will\nbe aligned with the \\(A\\)s simultaneously.  \nAt this moment, the rightmost \\(B\\) has traveled past all the\n\\(C\\)s, but only half the \\(A\\)s; since they are of equal\nsize, it has traveled both some distance and half that\ndistance. The putative contradiction is not drawn here however,\npresumably because it is clear that these contrary distances are\nrelative to the \\(C\\)s and \\(A\\)s respectively;\nthere’s generally no contradiction in standing in different\nrelations to different things. Instead, the distances are converted to\ntimes by dividing the distances by the speed of the \\(B\\)s; half\nthe distance at a given speed takes half the time. Then a\ncontradiction threatens because the time between the states is\nunequivocal, not relative—the process takes some (non-zero) time\nand half that time.  \nThe general verdict is that Zeno was hopelessly confused about\nrelative velocities in this paradox. If the \\(B\\)s are moving\nwith speed S m/s to the right with respect to the\n\\(A\\)s, and if the \\(C\\)s are moving with speed S\nm/s to the left with respect to the \\(A\\)s, then the\n\\(C\\)s are moving with speed \\(S+S = 2\\)S\nm/s to the left with respect to the \\(B\\)s. And so, of\ncourse, while the \\(B\\)s travel twice as far relative to the\n\\(C\\)s as the \\(A\\)s, they do so at twice the relative\nspeed, and so the times are the same either way. But could Zeno have\nbeen this confused? (Sattler, 2015, argues against this and other\ncommon readings of the stadium.) \nPerhaps (Davey, 2007) he had the following in mind instead (while Zeno\nis smarter according to this reading, it doesn’t quite fit\nAristotle’s words so well): suppose the \\(A\\)s, \\(B\\)s\nand \\(C\\)s are of the smallest spatial extent,\n‘point-sized’, where ‘points’ are of zero size\nif space is continuous, or finite if space is ‘atomic’.\nSuppose further that there are no spaces between the \\(A\\)s, or\nbetween the \\(B\\)s, or between the \\(C\\)s. During the motion\nabove the leading \\(B\\) passes all of the \\(C\\)s, and half\nof the \\(A\\)s, so half as many \\(A\\)s as \\(C\\)s. Now,\nas a point moves continuously along a line with no gaps, there is a\n1:1 correspondence between the instants of time and the points on the\nline—to each instant a point, and to each point an instant.\nTherefore, the number of ‘\\(A\\)-instants’ of time the\nleading \\(B\\) takes to pass the \\(A\\)s is half the number of\n‘\\(C\\)-instants’ takes to pass the\n\\(C\\)s—even though these processes take the same amount of\ntime. If we then, crucially, assume that half the instants means half\nthe time, we conclude that half the time equals the whole time, a\ncontradiction.  \nWe saw above, in our discussion of complete divisibility, the problem\nwith such reasoning applied to continuous lines: any line segment has\nthe same number of points, so nothing can be inferred from the number\nof points in this way—certainly not that half the points (here,\ninstants) means half the length (or time). The paradox fails as\nstated. But doesn’t the very claim that the intervals contain\nthe same number of instants conflict with the step of the argument\nthat concludes that there are half as many \\(A\\)-instants as\n\\(C\\)-instants? This issue is subtle for infinite sets: to give a\ndifferent example, 1, 2, 3, … is in 1:1 correspondence with 2,\n4, 6, …, and so there are the same number of each. It is in\nthis sense of 1:1 correspondence—the precise sense of\n‘same number’ used in mathematics—that any finite\nline has the same number of points as any other. However, informally\nspeaking, there are also ‘half as many’ even numbers as\nwhole numbers: the pairs (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), … can also be\nput into 1:1 correspondence with 2, 4, 6, …. Similarly, there\nare—informally speaking—half as many \\(A\\)-instants\nas \\(C\\)-instants: \\(A\\)-instants are in 1:1 correspondence\nwith pairs of \\(C\\)-instants. So there is no contradiction in the\nnumber of points: the informal half equals the strict whole (a\ndifferent solution is required for an atomic theory, along the lines\npresented in the final paragraph of this section).  \n(Let me mention a similar paradox of motion—the\n‘millstone’—attributed to Maimonides. Imagine two\nwheels, one twice the radius and circumference of the other, fixed to\na single axle. Let them run down a track, with one rail raised to keep\nthe axle horizontal, for one turn of both wheels [they turn at the\nsame rate because of the axle]: each point of each wheel makes contact\nwith exactly one point of its rail, and every point of each rail with\nexactly one point of its wheel. Does the assembly travel a distance\nequal to the circumference of the big wheel? Of the small? Both?\nSomething else? How? This problem too requires understanding of the\ncontinuum; but it is not a paradox of Zeno’s so we shall leave\nit to the ingenuity of the reader.)  \nA final possible reconstruction of Zeno’s Stadium takes it as an\nargument against an atomic theory of space and time, which is\ninteresting because contemporary physics explores such a view when it\nattempts to ‘quantize’ spacetime. Suppose then the sides\nof each cube equal the ‘quantum’ of length and that the\ntwo moments considered are separated by a single quantum of time. Then\nsomething strange must happen, for the rightmost \\(B\\) and the\nmiddle \\(C\\) pass each other during the motion, and yet there is\nno moment at which they are level: since the two moments are separated\nby the smallest possible time, there can be no instant between\nthem—it would be a time smaller than the smallest time from the\ntwo moments we considered. Conversely, if one insisted that if they\npass then there must be a moment when they are level, then it shows\nthat cannot be a shortest finite interval—whatever it is, just\nrun this argument against it. However, why should one insist on this\nassumption? The problem is that one naturally imagines quantized space\nas being like a chess board, on which the chess pieces are frozen\nduring each quantum of time. Then one wonders when the red queen, say,\ngets from one square to the next, or how she gets past the white queen\nwithout being level with her. But the analogy is misleading. It is\nbetter to think of quantized space as a giant matrix of lights that\nholds some pattern of illuminated lights for each quantum of time. In\nthis analogy a lit bulb represents the presence of an object: for\ninstance a series of bulbs in a line lighting up in sequence represent\na body moving in a straight line. In this case there is no temptation\nto ask when the light ‘gets’ from one bulb to the\nnext—or in analogy how the body moves from one location to the\nnext. (Here we touch on questions of temporal parts, and whether\nobjects ‘endure’ or ‘perdure’.)\n \nTwo more paradoxes are attributed to Zeno by Aristotle, but they are\ngiven in the context of other points that he is making, so Zeno’s\nintent cannot be determined with any certainty: even whether they are\nintended to argue against plurality and motion. We will discuss them\nbriefly for completeness. \nWhen he sets up his theory of place—the crucial spatial notion\nin his theory of motion—Aristotle lists various theories and\nproblems that his predecessors, including Zeno, have formulated on the\nsubject. The argument again raises issues of the infinite, since the\nsecond step of the argument argues for an infinite regress of\nplaces. However, Aristotle presents it as an argument against the very\nidea of place, rather than plurality (thereby likely taking it out of\ncontext). It is hard to feel the force of the conclusion, for why\nshould there not be an infinite series of places of places of places\nof …? Presumably the worry would be greater for someone who\n(like Aristotle) believed that there could not be an actual infinity\nof things, for the argument seems to show that there are. But as we\nhave discussed above, today we need have no such qualms; there seems\nnothing problematic with an actual infinity of places. \nThe only other way one might find the regress troubling is if one\nholds that bodies have ‘absolute’ places, in the sense\nthat there is always a unique privileged answer to the question\n‘where is it’? The problem then is not that there are\ninfinitely many places, but just that there are many. And Aristotle\nmight have had this concern, for in his theory of motion, the natural\nmotion of a body is determined by the relation of its place to the\ncenter of the universe: an account that requires place to be\ndeterminate, because natural motion is. (See Sorabji 1988 and Morrison\n2002 for general, competing accounts of Aristotle’s views on place;\nchapter 3 of the latter especially for a discussion of Aristotle’s\ntreatment of the paradox.) But supposing that one holds that place is\nabsolute for whatever reason, then for example, where am I as I write?\nIf the paradox is right then I’m in my place, and I’m also\nin my place’s place, and my place’s place’s place,\nand my …. Since I’m in all these places any might\nseem an appropriate answer to the question. Various responses are\nconceivable: deny absolute places (especially since our physics does\nnot require them), define a notion of place that is unique in all\ncases (arguably Aristotle’s solution), or perhaps claim that places\nare their own places thereby cutting off the regress!\n \nIn context, Aristotle is explaining that a fraction of a force many\nnot produce the same fraction of motion. For instance, while 100\nstevedores can tow a barge, one might not get it to move at all, let\nalone 1/100th of the speed; so given as much time as you like he may\nnot move it as far as the 100. (We describe this fact as the effect of\nfriction.) Similarly, just because a falling bushel of millet makes a\nwhooshing sound as it falls, it does not follow that each individual\ngrain would, or does: given as much time as you like it won’t move the\nsame amount of air as the bushel does. However, while refuting this\npremise Aristotle does not explain what role it played for Zeno, and\nwe can only speculate. It’s not even clear whether it is part of a\nparadox, or some other dispute: did Zeno also claim to show that a\nsingle grain of millet does not make a sound? One speculation\nis that our senses reveal that it does not, since we cannot hear a\nsingle grain falling. Then Aristotle’s response is apt; and so is the\nsimilar response that hearing itself requires movement in the air\nabove a certain threshold.\n \nIn this final section we should consider briefly the impact that Zeno\nhas had on various philosophers; a search of the literature will\nreveal that these debates continue.  The Pythagoreans: For the first half of the Twentieth century, the\nmajority reading—following Tannery (1885)—of Zeno held\nthat his arguments were directed against a technical doctrine of the\nPythagoreans. According to this reading they held that all things were\ncomposed of elements that had the properties of a unit number, a\ngeometric point and a physical atom: this kind of position would fit\nwith their doctrine that reality is fundamentally mathematical.\nHowever, in the middle of the century a series of commentators\n(Vlastos, 1967, summarizes the argument and contains references)\nforcefully argued that Zeno’s target was instead a common sense\nunderstanding of plurality and motion—one grounded in familiar\ngeometrical notions—and indeed that the doctrine was not a major\npart of Pythagorean thought. We have implicitly assumed that these\narguments are correct in our readings of the paradoxes. That said,\nTannery’s interpretation still has its defenders (see e.g.,\nMatson 2001). The Atomists: Aristotle (On Generation and Corruption\n316b34) claims that our third argument—the one concerning\ncomplete divisibility—was what convinced the atomists that there\nmust be smallest, indivisible parts of matter. See Abraham (1972) for\na further discussion of Zeno’s connection to the atomists. Temporal Becoming: In the early part of the Twentieth century\nseveral influential philosophers attempted to put Zeno’s\narguments to work in the service of a metaphysics of ‘temporal\nbecoming’, the (supposed) process by which the present comes\ninto being. Such thinkers as Bergson (1911), James (1911, Ch\n10–11) and Whitehead (1929) argued that Zeno’s paradoxes\nshow that space and time are not structured as a mathematical\ncontinuum: they argued that the way to preserve the reality of motion\nwas to deny that space and time are composed of points and instants.\nHowever, we have clearly seen that the tools of standard modern\nmathematics are up to the job of resolving the paradoxes, so no such\nconclusion seems warranted: if the present indeed\n‘becomes’, there is no reason to think that the process is\nnot captured by the continuum. Applying the Mathematical Continuum to Physical Space and Time:\nFollowing a lead given by Russell (1929, 182–198), a number of\nphilosophers—most notably Grünbaum (1967)—took up the\ntask of showing how modern mathematics could solve all of Zeno’s\nparadoxes; their work has thoroughly influenced our discussion of the\narguments. What they realized was that a purely mathematical solution\nwas not sufficient: the paradoxes not only question abstract\nmathematics, but also the nature of physical reality. So what they\nsought was an argument not only that Zeno posed no threat to the\nmathematics of infinity but also that that mathematics correctly\ndescribes objects, time and space. It would not answer Zeno’s\nparadoxes if the mathematical framework we invoked was not a good\ndescription of actual space, time, and motion! The idea that a\nmathematical law—say Newton’s law of universal\ngravity—may or may not correctly describe things is familiar,\nbut some aspects of the mathematics of infinity—the nature of\nthe continuum, definition of infinite sums and so on—seem so\nbasic that it may be hard to see at first that they too apply\ncontingently. But surely they do: nothing guarantees a\npriori  that space has the structure of the continuum, or\neven that parts of space add up according to Cauchy’s\ndefinition. (Salmon offers a nice example to help make the point:\nsince alcohol dissolves in water, if you mix the two you end up with\nless than the sum of their volumes, showing that even ordinary\naddition is not applicable to every kind of system.) Our belief that\nthe mathematical theory of infinity describes space and time is\njustified to the extent that the laws of physics assume that it does,\nand to the extent that those laws are themselves confirmed by\nexperience. While it is true that almost all physical theories assume\nthat space and time do indeed have the structure of the continuum, it\nis also the case that quantum theories of gravity likely imply that\nthey do not. While no one really knows where this research will\nultimately lead, it is quite possible that space and time will turn\nout, at the most fundamental level, to be quite unlike the\nmathematical continuum that we have assumed here. \nOne should also note that Grünbaum took the job of showing that\nmodern mathematics describes space and time to involve something\nrather different from arguing that it is confirmed by experience. The\ndominant view at the time (though not at present) was that scientific\nterms had meaning insofar as they referred directly to objects of\nexperience—such as ‘1m ruler’—or, if they\nreferred to ‘theoretical’ rather than\n‘observable’ entities—such as ‘a point of\nspace’ or ‘1/2 of 1/2 of … 1/2 a\nracetrack’—then they obtained meaning by their logical\nrelations—via definitions and theoretical laws—to such\nobservation terms. Thus Grünbaum undertook an impressive program\nto give meaning to all terms involved in the modern theory of\ninfinity, interpreted as an account of space and time. Supertasks: A further strand of thought concerns what Black\n(1950–51) dubbed ‘infinity machines’. Black and his\nfollowers wished to show that although Zeno’s paradoxes offered\nno problem to mathematics, they showed that after all mathematics was\nnot applicable to space, time and motion. Most starkly, our resolution\nto the Dichotomy and Achilles assumed that the complete run could be\nbroken down into an infinite series of half runs, which could be\nsummed. But is it really possible to complete any infinite series of\nactions: to complete what is known as a ‘supertask’? If\nnot, and assuming that Atalanta and Achilles can complete their tasks,\ntheir complete runs cannot be correctly described as an infinite\nseries of half-runs, although modern mathematics would so describe\nthem. What infinity machines are supposed to establish is that an\ninfinite series of tasks cannot be completed—so any completable\ntask cannot be broken down into an infinity of smaller tasks, whatever\nmathematics suggests. Infinitesimals: Finally, we have seen how to tackle the paradoxes\nusing the resources of mathematics as developed in the Nineteenth\ncentury. For a long time it was considered one of the great virtues of\nthis system that it finally showed that infinitesimal quantities,\nsmaller than any finite number but larger than zero, are unnecessary.\n(Newton’s calculus for instance effectively made use of such\nnumbers, treating them sometimes as zero and sometimes as finite; the\nproblem with such an approach is that how to treat the numbers is a\nmatter of intuition not rigor.) However, in the Twentieth century\nRobinson showed how to introduce infinitesimal numbers into\nmathematics: this is the system of ‘non-standard analysis’\n(the familiar system of real numbers, given a rigorous foundation by\nDedekind, is by contrast just ‘analysis’). Analogously,\nBell (1988) explains how infinitesimal line segments can be introduced\ninto geometry, and comments on their relation to Zeno. Moreover,\nMcLaughlin (1992, 1994) shows how Zeno’s paradoxes can be\nresolved in non-standard analysis; they are no more argument against\nnon-standard analysis than against the standard mathematics we have\nassumed here. It should be emphasized however that—contrary to\nMcLaughlin’s suggestions—there is no need for non-standard\nanalysis to solve the paradoxes: either system is equally successful.\n(Reeder, 2015, argues that non-standard analysis is unsatisfactory\nregarding the arrow, and offers an alternative account using a\ndifferent conception of infinitesimals.) The construction of\nnon-standard analysis does however raise a further question about the\napplicability of analysis to physical space and time: it seems\nplausible that all physical theories can be formulated in either\nterms, and so as far as our experience extends both seem equally\nconfirmed. But they cannot both be true of space and time: either\nspace has infinitesimal parts or it doesn’t. \nAfter the relevant entries in this encyclopedia, the place to begin\nany further investigation is Salmon (2001), which contains some of the\nmost important articles on Zeno up to 1970, and an impressively\ncomprehensive bibliography of works in English in the Twentieth\nCentury.  \nOne might also take a look at Huggett (1999, Ch. 3) and Huggett (2010,\nCh. 2–3) for further source passages and discussion. For\nintroductions to the mathematical ideas behind the modern resolutions,\nthe Appendix to Salmon (2001) or Stewart (2017) are good starts;\nRussell (1919) and Courant et al. (1996, Chs. 2 and 9) are\nalso both wonderful sources. Finally, three collections of original\nsources for Zeno’s paradoxes: Lee (1936 [2015]) contains\neverything known, Kirk et al (1983, Ch. 9) contains a great\ndeal of material (in English and Greek) with useful commentaries, and\nCohen et al. (1995) also has the main passages.","contact.mail":"huggett@uic.edu","contact.domain":"uic.edu"}]
