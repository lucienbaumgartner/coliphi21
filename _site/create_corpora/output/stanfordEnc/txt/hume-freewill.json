Hume’s arguments on this subject are\nfound primarily in the sections titled “Of liberty and\nnecessity”, as first presented in A Treatise of Human\nNature (2.3.1–2) and, later, in a slightly amended form, in the\nEnquiry concerning Human Understanding (sec. 8). Although\nboth contributions share the same title, there are, nevertheless, some\nsignificant differences between them. This includes, for example, some\nsubstantial additions in the Enquiry discussion as it relates\nto problems of religion, such as predestination and divine\nforeknowledge. These differences should not, however, be exaggerated.\nHume’s basic strategy and compatibilist commitments remain much the\nsame in both works.\n\n\nThis article will be arranged around a basic contrast between two\nalternative interpretations of Hume’s compatibilist strategy: the\n“classical” and “naturalistic”\ninterpretations. According to the classical account, Hume’s effort to\narticulate the conditions of moral responsibility, and the way they\nrelate to the free will problem, should be understood primarily in\nterms of his views about the logic of  the concepts\nof “liberty” and “necessity”. In contrast with\nthis, the naturalistic approach maintains that what is essential to\nHume’s account of the nature and conditions of responsible conduct\nis his description of the role that moral\nsentiment plays in this sphere. How we interpret Hume’s\ncore arguments relating to the free will debate must be understood, on\nthis view, with reference to these psychological claims and concerns (which also accounts for the use of the label “naturalism” in this context). On either account, the contrast between these two interpretations will be of importance, not only for our general understanding of Hume’s\nphilosophical system, but also for any adequate assessment of the contemporary value and relevance of Hume’s views on this subject. \n\n\nThe first two sections of this article present and contrast the\nclassical and naturalistic interpretations. Hume’s views on causation\nand necessity are highly relevant to both these interpretations. The\nfollowing three sections sections consider the contemporary\nsignificance of Hume’s contribution, particularly as interpreted\nby the naturalistic account. The sixth and final section examines the\nrelevance of Hume’s views on free will for matters of religion.\n\n\nFor many years the established view of Hume has been that he is a\nprincipal and founding figure of classical compatibilism, as located\nin the empiricist philosophical tradition that stretches from Hobbes,\nthrough Hume, on to Mill, Russell, Schlick and Ayer. Classical\ncompatibilists believe, with libertarians, that we need some adequate\ntheory of what free action is, where this is understood as providing\nthe relevant conditions of moral agency and responsibility.\nCompatibilists, however, reject the view that free action requires the\nfalsity of determinism or that an action cannot be both free and\ncausally necessitated by antecedent conditions. According to the\nclassical compatibilist strategy, not only is freedom compatible with\ncausal determinism, the absence of causation and necessity would make\nfree and responsible action impossible. A free action is an action\ncaused by the agent, whereas an unfree action is caused by some other,\nexternal cause. Whether an action is free or not depends on the type\nof cause, not on the absence of causation and necessity. An uncaused\naction would be entirely capricious and random and could not be\nattributed to any agent, much less interpreted as a free and\nresponsible act. Understood this way, the classical compatibilist\nstrategy involves an attempt to explain and describe the\nlogic of our concepts relating to issues of freedom\nand determinism. It is primarily concerned with conceptual issues\nrather than with any empirical investigations into our human moral\npsychology. On the classical interpretation this is how Hume’s\ncore arguments should be understood. \nAs Hume’s title “Of liberty and necessity” makes\nplain there are two key ideas in play are “liberty”\n(freedom) and “necessity” (causation and determinism). In\nhis Abstract of the Treatise Hume emphasizes that\nhis “reasoning puts the whole [free-will] controversy in a new\nlight, by giving a new definition of necessity” (T Abs. 34/\n661). Despite this, the classical interpretation places heavy weight\non the significance of his views on the nature of liberty as the\nrelevant basis for explaining Hume’s position on this subject.\nThe strategy that Hume follows, according to this reading, is much the\nsame as that which was pursued by Hobbes. It is the distinction\nbetween two kinds of liberty that is, on this account, especially\nimportant. Hume’s views on liberty in the Treatise are not, however, entirely consistent with his later views as presented in the Enquiry. \nIn the Treatise Hume distinguishes between two kinds of\nliberty. \nLiberty of spontaneity involves an agent being able to act according\nto her own willings and desires, unhindered by external obstacles\nwhich might constrain or restrict her conduct (e.g., the walls or bars\nof a prison [T 2.3.1.17/406]). This kind of liberty does not imply an\nabsence of causation and necessity, unless we incorrectly assume that\nwhat is caused is somehow compelled or forced to occur. In the\nEnquiry Hume drops the distinction between two kinds of\nliberty and instead provides an account of what he calls\n“hypothetical liberty” (EU 8.23/95). A liberty of this\nkind involves “a power of acting or not acting, according to\nthe determinations of the will; that is, if we choose to remain\nat rest, we may; if we choose to move, we also may.” According\nto Hume this sort of hypothetical liberty is “universally\nallowed to belong to every one, who is not a prisoner and in\nchains” (ibid.). Although Hume is committed to the existence of\nboth liberty of spontaneity and hypothetical liberty, they are not the\nsame. A person may enjoy liberty of spontaneity and act according to\nthe determinations of her own will, and still lack hypothetical\nliberty. If she chose otherwise her action might still be obstructed\n(e.g., as with a person who chooses to remain in a room but could not\nleave if she chose to because the door is locked). \nIn the Treatise Hume tends to identify liberty with\nindifference rather than spontaneity and even suggests “that\nliberty and chance are synonimous” (T 2.3.2.8/412; cf. T\n2.3.1.18/407; but see also EU 8.25/96). For this reason he presents\nhis arguments as aiming to show that liberty, so understood\n(qua indifference), is, if not contradictory, “directly\ncontrary to experience” (T 2.3.1.18/407). In placing emphasis\non this negative task of refuting “the doctrine of\nliberty or chance” (T 2.3.2.7/412), Hume is\nhappy to present himself as coming down firmly on the side of\n“the doctrine of necessity” (T 2.3.2.3/409), which he is\ncareful to define in a way that avoids any confusion between causation\nand compulsion or force (as is explained in more detail below). The\naccount that Hume offers in the Enquiry strikes a more\nbalanced note. In this work Hume presents his position as not so much\na refutation of “the doctrine of liberty” or\n“free-will” (T 2.3.1.18/407; cf. T 2.1.10.5/312), but\nrather as a “reconciling project with regard to the question of\nliberty and necessity” (EU 8.23/95; although even in the\nEnquiry his references to liberty are not uniformly to\nspontaneity). Although these differences should be noted, it is\nimportant not to exaggerate them. In the Treatise Hume makes\nclear that liberty of spontaneity is “the most common sense of\nthe word” and the “only… species of liberty, which\nit concerns us to preserve” (T 2.3.2.1/407–8). It is evident,\ntherefore, that there is also a “reconciling project”\nimplicit in the Treatise and that his arguments against\n“the doctrine of liberty” remain tightly focused on\nliberty of indifference. \nIn both the Treatise and the Enquiry Hume claims\nthat the most original or interesting part of his contribution to free\nwill rests with his definition or understanding of what we mean by\nnecessity (T 2.3.1.18, 2.3.2.4/407, 409–10; see also EU 8.1–3,\n8.21–25/80–81, 92–96). It is this issue, Hume claims, that has been\nthe primary obstacle to resolving this controversy. According to Hume\nthere are “two particulars, which we are to consider as\nessential to necessity, viz. the constant union and the\ninference of the mind; and wherever we discover these we must\nacknowledge a necessity” (T 2.3.1.4/400). In order to explain\nthis, Hume begins with a description of causation and necessity as we\nobserve it in “the operations of external bodies” (T\n2.3.1.3/399) or in “the actions of matter” (T Abs. 34/\n661). Here we find “not the least traces of indifference or\nliberty” and we can see that “[e]very object is\ndetermin’d by an absolute fate” (T 2.3.1.3/400). What\nthis means, Hume explains, is that we discover that there exist\nconstant conjunctions of objects, whereby resembling objects of one\nkind are uniformly followed by resembling objects of another kind\n(e.g., Xs are uniformly followed by Ys). (See, in particular, T 1.3; T\nAbs. 8–9, 24–26/649–50, 655–57; and also EU 4 and 7). When we\nexperience regularities of this sort we are able to draw relevant\ninferences, and we deem objects of the first kind causes and those of\nthe second kind their effects. \nThe crucial point, on Hume’s account, is that we can discover no\nfurther “ultimate connexion” (T 1.3.6.11/91)\nbetween cause and effect beyond our experience of their regular union.\nThere is no perceived or known power or energy in a cause such that we\ncould draw any inference to its effect or by which the cause compels\nor forces its effect to occur (T 1.3.12.20, 1.3.14.4–7/139, 157–59).\nNevertheless, on the basis of our experience of regularities or\nconstant conjunctions of objects, the mind, on the appearance of the\nfirst object, naturally draws an inference to that of the other (T\n1.3.14.20–22, 31/164–66, 169–70; cf. EU 7.28–29/75–77). In other\nwords, our experience of regularities serves as the basis upon which\nwe can draw inferences to the existence of an object on the appearance\nof another. All that we find of causation and necessity in bodies or\nmatter, Hume argues, is this conjunction of like objects along with\nthe inference of the mind from one to the other. The relevant\nquestion, therefore, is do we find similar features in the operations\nof human action? \nOur experience, Hume maintains, proves that “our actions have a\nconstant union with our motives, tempers, and circumstances” and\nthat we draw relevant inferences from one to the other on this basis\n(T 2.3.1.4/401). Although there are some apparent irregularities in\nboth the natural and the moral realms, this is entirely due to the\ninfluence of contrary or concealed causes of which we are ignorant (T\n2.3.1.11–12/403–4; cf. EU 8.15/88). \nIn support of this claim Hume cites various regularities that we\nobserve in human society, where class, sex, occupation, age, and other\nsuch factors are seen to be reliably correlated with different motives\nand conduct (T 2.3.1.5–10/401–3). Regularities of this kind make it\npossible for us to draw the sorts of inferences that are needed for\nhuman social life, such as in all our reasoning concerning business,\npolitics, war, and so on (T 2.3.1.15/405; EU 8.17–18/89–90). In the\nabsence of necessity, so understood, we could not survive or live\ntogether. \nHume goes on to argue that not only is necessity of this kind\nessential to human society, it is also “essential to religion\nand morality” (T 2.3.2.5 410), because of its relevance to the\nfoundations of responsibility and punishment. If the motives of\nrewards and punishments had no uniform and reliable influence on\nconduct then law and society would be impossible (ibid.; cp. EU 8.28/\n97–98; see also T 3.3.4.4/609). Beyond this, whether we consider\nhuman or divine rewards and punishments, the justice of such practices\ndepends on the fact that the agent has produced or brought about these\nactions through her own will. The “doctrine of liberty or\nchance,” however, would remove this connection between agent and\naction and so no one could be properly held accountable for their\nconduct (T 2.3.2.6/411). It is, therefore, “only upon the\nprinciples of necessity, that a person acquires any merit or demerit\nfrom his actions, however the common opinion may incline to the\ncontrary” (ibid.; EU 8.31/99). Read this way, Hume is mostly\nrestating a claim found in many other compatibilist accounts, that necessity (determinism) is needed to support a generally forward-looking, utilitarian theory of moral\nresponsibility and punishment. \nWhy, then is there so much resistance to “the doctrine of\nnecessity”? The principal explanation for this resistance to\n“the doctrine of necessity” is found, according to Hume,\nin confusion about the nature of necessity as we discover it in\nmatter. Although in ordinary life we all rely upon and reason\nupon the principles of necessity there may well be some reluctance to\ncall this union and inference necessity. \nThe supposition that there is some further power or energy in matter,\nwhereby causes somehow compel or force their effects to occur, is the\nfundamental source of confusion on this issue. It is this that\nencourages us to reject the suggestion that our actions are subject to\nnecessity on the ground that this would imply some kind of violence or\nconstraint – something that would be incompatible with liberty\nof spontaneity. When confusions of this sort are removed, all that\nremains is the verbal quibble about using the term\n“necessity” – which is not itself a substantial\npoint of disagreement. \nHume’s suggestion that our ideas of causation and necessity should be\nunderstood in terms of constant conjunction of objects and the\ninference of the mind became a central thread of the classical\ncompatibilist position. A key element of this is his diagnosis of the\nsource of incompatibilism as rooted in a confusion between causation\nand compulsion. What are we to make of this aspect of the\ncompatibilist strategy? The first thing we need to consider is how\nthis argument stands in relation to the other compatibilist arguments\nalready described? We may begin by noting that Hume’s strategy, as\nbuilt around his “new definition of necessity” (TA, 34/661), appears\nto concede that a stronger metaphysical “tie” or “bond” between cause\nand effect would indeed “imply something of force, violence, and\nconstraint”. From the perspective of the (core) compatibilist\nargument, as developed around the notion of “liberty of spontaneity”\nand “hypothetical liberty”, this is a basic mistake. The distinction\nthat is crucial to the original argument is that between actions that\nhave causes that are internal to the agent (i.e., motives and\ndesires of some relevant kind) and those that have external causes. It\nis the latter that are compelled or constrained actions (such as we\nfind in the case of the prisoner who is in chains: EU 8.23/95). This\ncrucial distinction between actions that are brought about through the\nagent’s motives and desires and those that are not is not compromised\nby “metaphysical” (non-regularity) accounts of causation. What is\nrelevant to whether an action was compelled or not is the nature of\nthe cause (i.e., the object), not the nature of the\ncausal relation. Hume’s argument relating to the advantages\nof his “new definition of necessity” directly challenges this –\nso one or other of these two claims must be abandoned. \nAnother crucial claim of the original strategy was that if an agent is\nto be (justly) held responsible for her actions then she must be\ncausally connected to them in the right way. Hume’s “new\ndefinition of necessity” presents some awkward problems for this\nrequirement. More specifically, it may be argued that if we remove\n“metaphysical” necessity of any kind from our conception of the causal\nrelation, and all objects are “entirely loose and separate...\nconjoined but never connected” (EU 7.26/73–4\n– Hume’s emphasis), Hume’s own form of compatibilism is\nvulnerable to the same objection that he raised against the suggestion\nthat free actions are uncaused. That is to say, a mere\nregular conjunction between events cannot serve to adequately\nconnect the agent with her action. Hume’s theory of\ncausation, therefore, threatens to saw off the compatibilist branch\nthat he is sitting on. \nApart from these “internal” difficulties among Hume’s core arguments,\nit may also be questioned whether Hume’s alternative account of\ncausation serves to allay or diffuse other (and deeper) worries that\nlibertarians and incompatibilists may have about his proposed\n“reconciliation”. What libertarians seek – particularly but not\nexclusively in the 18th c. context – is an account of moral agency\nthat rests with agents who possess active powers of some kind\nsuch that they have genuine open alternatives in the same (causal)\nconditions. Related to this, libertarians also insist on making a\ndistinction between agents who can intervene in the natural\ncausal order and, on the other side, beings who are simply part of the\nnatural causal order and fully integrated within it. Real agency\nrequires the causal series to begin with the agent, not to run through\nthe agent. Hume’s revisionary “new definitions” of causation and\nnecessity satisfies none of these fundamental concerns or\nrequirements. Although Hume suggests that “a few intelligible\ndefinitions” should immediately put an end to this controversy (EU\n8.2/81), he must have been well aware that he was far from providing\nthe sort of metaphysical resources that libertarians are seeking or\nsatisfying the demands that they place on free, responsible moral\nagency. \nHume also advances two other explanations for resistance to “the\ndoctrine of necessity”. One of these concerns religion, which we\ndiscuss further below. The other concerns, what we might describe as\nthe phenomenology of agency and the way in which it seems to discredit\nHume’s necessitarian claims. Hume concedes that when we consider our\nactions from the agent’s perspective (i.e., the first person\nperspective) we have “a false sensation or experience even of\nthe liberty of indifference” (T 2.3.2.2/408 – Hume’s emphasis;\ncf. EU 8.22n18/94n). The basis of this is that when we are acting we\nmay not experience any “determination of thought” whereby we infer\nthe action to be performed. However, from the spectator’s (third\nperson) perspective the situation is quite different. The spectator\nwill “seldom feel such a looseness and indifference” and will reliably\ninfer actions from an agent’s motives and character. For this reason,\nalthough when we act we may find it hard to accept that “we were\ngovern’d by necessity, and that ’twas utterly impossible for us to\nhave acted otherwise” (T 2.3.2.1/407), the spectator’s perspective\nshows that this is simply a “false sensation”. Put another way, the\nagent perspective may encourage the view that the future is “open”\nwith respect to how we will act but this supposition is contradicted\nby the opposing spectator perspective, which is generally reliable. It\nis worth adding that this claim is consistent with Hume’s account in\nthe Enquiry of “hypothetical liberty”. There is no\ncontradiction between a spectator being able to reliably infer how an\nagent will act and the fact that how that agent will act depends on\nhow he wills in these circumstances. \nThe above interpretation suggests that Hume’s primary aim in his\ndiscussion “Of liberty and necessity” is to defend an account of moral\nfreedom understood in terms of “liberty of spontaneity”. Our tendency\nto confuse this form of liberty with indifference is a result of a\nmistaken understanding of the nature of causation and necessity. The\nsignificance of Hume’s contribution, on this interpretation, rests\nlargely with his application of his “new definition of necessity” to\nthis issue. All this is, in turn, generally consistent with arguments\nby leading representatives of classical compatibilism who came after\nHume (viz. Mill, Russell, Schlick, Ayer, et al). If this is an\naccurate and complete account of Hume’s approach then it is liable to\nall the objections that have been levelled against the classical compatibilist view. \nThe first and most obvious of these objections is that “liberty of spontaneity” is a wholly inadequate\nconception of moral freedom. Kant, famously, describes this account of\nmoral freedom as a “wretched subterfuge” and suggests that\na freedom of this kind belongs to a clock that moves its hands by\nmeans of internal causes. If our will is itself determined by\nantecedent natural causes, then we are no more accountable for our\nactions than any other mechanical object whose movements are\ninternally conditioned. Individuals who enjoy nothing more than a\nliberty of this nature are, the incompatibilist claims, little more\nthan “robots” or “puppets” subject to the play\nof fate. This general line of criticism, targeted against any\nunderstanding of moral freedom in terms of “spontaneity”, leads\ndirectly to two further important criticisms. \nThe incompatibilist maintains that if our willings and choices are\nthemselves determined by antecedent causes then we could never choose\notherwise than we do. Given the antecedent causal conditions, we must\nalways act as we do. We cannot, therefore, be held responsible for our\nconduct since, on this account, we have no “genuine\nalternatives” or “open possibilities” available to\nus. Incompatibilists, as already noted, do not accept that Hume’s\nnotion of “hypothetical liberty”, as presented in the\nEnquiry, can deal with this objection. It is true, of course,\nthat hypothetical liberty leaves room for the truth of conditionals\nthat suggest that we could have acted otherwise if we had\nchosen to do so. However, it still remains the case, the\nincompatibilist argues, that the agent could not have chosen otherwise\ngiven the actual circumstances. Responsibility, they claim,\nrequires categorical freedom to choose otherwise in the same\ncircumstances. Hypothetical freedom alone will not suffice. One way of\nexpressing this point in more general terms is that the\nincompatibilist holds that for responsibility we need more than\nfreedom of action, we also need freedom of will –\nunderstood as a power to choose between open alternatives. Failing\nthis, the agent has no ultimate control over her conduct. \nHume’s effort to draw a distinction between free and unfree (i.e.,\ncompelled) action itself rests on a distinction between internal and\nexternal causes. Critics of compatibilism argue that\nthis – attractively simple – distinction is impossible to\nmaintain. It seems obvious, for example, that there are cases in which\nan agent acts according to the determinations of his own will but is\nnevertheless clearly unfree. There are, in particular, circumstances\nin which an agent may be subject to, and act on, desires and wants\nthat are themselves compulsive in nature (e.g., as with a drug addict\nor kleptomaniac). Desires and wants of this kind, it is claimed, limit\nand undermine an agent’s freedom no less than external force and\nviolence. Although it may be true that in these circumstances the\nagent is acting according to his own desires or willings, it is\nequally clear that such an agent is neither free nor responsible for\nhis behavior. It would appear, therefore, that we are required to\nacknowledge that some causes “internal” to the agent may\nalso be regarded as compelling or constraining. This concession,\nhowever, generates serious difficulties for the classical\ncompatibilist strategy. It is no longer evident, given this\nconcession, which “internal” causes should be regarded as\n“constraining” or “compelling” and which\nshould not. Lying behind this objection is the more fundamental\nconcern that the spontaneity argument presupposes a wholly inadequate\nunderstanding of the nature of excusing and mitigating\nconsiderations. \nFinally, on this reading, Hume is understood as defending an\nessentially forward-looking and utilitarian account of moral\nresponsibility. Following thinkers like Thomas Hobbes, Hume points out\nthat rewards and punishments serve to cause people to act in some ways\nand not in others, which is clearly a matter of considerable social\nutility (T 2.3.2.5/410; EU 8.2897–98). This sort of\nforward-looking, utilitarian account of responsibility has been\nfurther developed by a number of other compatibilists with whom Hume\nis often closely identified (e.g., Moritz Schlick and J.J.C. Smart).\nForward-looking, utilitarian accounts of responsibility of this kind\nhave been subject to telling criticism. The basic problem with any\naccount of this kind, incompatibilists have argued, is that they are\nentirely blind to matters of desert and so lack the required\n(backward-looking) retributive element that is required in\nthis sphere. Moreover, any theory of responsibility of this kind,\ncritics say, is both too wide and too narrow. It is too wide because\nit would appear to make children and animals responsible; and it is\ntoo narrow because it implies that those who are dead and beyond the\nreach of the relevant forms of “treatment” are actually\nresponsible for their actions. For all these reasons, critics argue,\nwe should reject compatibilist theories constructed along the lines of\nthese distinctions. \nWhat we need to ask now is to what extent the classical interpretation\nserves to capture the essentials of Hume’s position on this subject?\nFrom the perspective of the alternative naturalistic reading there are\ntwo fundamental flaws in the classical reading: \nFirst, and foremost, the classical reading fails to provide any proper\naccount of the role of moral sentiment in Hume’s understanding of (the\nnature and conditions) of moral responsibility. Part of the\nexplanation for this is that the classical interpretation treats\nHume’s views on free will in isolation from other parts of his\nphilosophical system. In particular, it fails to adequately integrate\nhis discussion of free will with his theory of the passions (T 2.1 and\n2.2). We are more vulnerable to this mistake if we rely too heavily on\nHume’s discussion “Of liberty and necessity” as presented in the\nEnquiry. \nSecond, and related to the first issue, the classical reading suggests\nan overly simple, if not crude, account of the relationship between\nfreedom and moral responsibility. Whereas the classical account\nsuggests that responsibility may be analyzed directly in terms of free\n(or voluntary) action, the naturalistic interpretation suggests a very\ndifferent picture of this relationship. It would not be correct, for\nexample, to interpret Hume as endorsing what J.L. Mackie has called\n“the straight rule of responsibility”: which is that “an agent is\nresponsible for all and only his intentional actions” (Mackie, 1977):\n208; and also 221–2). This is, nevertheless, a view that the classical\ninterpretation encourages. \nIn order to see where the classical interpretation goes wrong we need\nto begin with an examination of Hume’s arguments in support of\nthe claim that necessity is essential to morality and that\n“indifference” would make morality impossible (T\n2.3.2.5–7/410–2).  \nIn order to understand the relevance of necessity for the conditions\nof holding a person responsible we we need to understand the workings\nof “the regular mechanism” of the indirect passions (DP\n6.19). In his discussion of love and hatred Hume says: \nOur virtues and vices are not the only causes of love and hatred.\nWealth and property, family and social relations, bodily qualities and\nattributes may also generate love or hate (T 2.1.2.5; 2.1.7.1–5/279,\n294f; DP 2.14–33). It is, nevertheless, our virtues and vices,\nunderstood as pleasurable or painful qualities of mind, that are\n“the most obvious causes of these passions” (T\n2.1.7.2/295; cp. 3.1.2.5/473; and also 3.3.1.3/574–5). In this way, by\nmeans of the general mechanism of the indirect passions, virtue and\nvice give rise to that “faint and imperceptible” form of\nlove and hatred which constitutes the moral sentiments. This is\nessential to all our ascriptions of moral responsibility. \nHume makes clear that it is not actions, as such, that give rise to\nour moral sentiments but rather our more enduring or persisting\ncharacter traits (T 2.2.3.4/348–9; and also 3.3.1.4–5/575). The\ncrucial passage in his discussion “Of liberty and\nnecessity” is the following: \nFurther below, in Book II, Hume expands on these remarks: \nIn these two passages Hume is making two distinct but related points.\nFirst, he maintains that “action”, considered as an\n“external performance” without any reference to the motive\nor intention that produced it, is not itself of moral concern. It is,\nrather, the “internal” cause of the action that arouses\nour moral sentiments. It is these aspects of action that inform us\nabout the mind and moral character of the agent. Second, the moral\nqualities of an agent that arouse our moral sentiments must be\n“durable or constant” – they cannot be\n“temporary and perishing” in nature in the way actions\nare. This second condition on the generation of moral sentiment is\nitself a particular instance of the more general observation that Hume\nhas made earlier on in Book II that the relationship between the\nquality or feature that gives rise to the indirect passions (i.e., its\ncause) and the person who is the object of the passion must not be\n“casual or inconstant” (T 2.1.6.7/293). It is,\nnevertheless, the first point that is especially important for our\npresent purpose of understanding why necessity is essential to\nmorality. \nIn order to know anyone’s motives and character we require\ninference, from their actions to their motives and character (T\n2.1.11.3; 3.3.1.7/317, 576). Without knowledge of anyone’s\ncharacter no sentiment of approbation or blame would be aroused in us.\nWithout inferences moving in this direction – from action to\ncharacter (as opposed to from character to actions) – no one\nwould be an object of praise or blame and, hence, no one would be\nregarded as morally responsible. In these circumstances, praising and\nblaming would be psychologically impossible. Along the same lines,\nexternal violence, like liberty of indifference, also makes it\nimpossible to regard someone as an object of praise or blame. When an\naction is produced by causes external to the agent we are led away\nfrom the agent’s character. Clearly, then, actions that are\neither uncaused or caused by external factors cannot render an agent\nresponsible, not because it would be unreasonable to hold the person\nresponsible, but rather because it would be psychologically impossible\nto hold the person responsible, where this stance is understood in\nterms of the operation of the moral sentiments. It is in this way that\nHume brings his observations concerning the operation of the indirect\npassions to bear on his claim that necessity is essential to morality\nand, in particular, to our attitudes and practices associated with\nresponsibility and punishment. \nIn light of this alternative account, we may conclude that the nature\nof Hume’s compatibilist strategy is significantly misrepresented by\nthe classical interpretation. Hume’s arguments purporting to\nshow that necessity is essential to morality are intimately connected\nwith his discussion of the indirect passions and the specific\nmechanism that generates the moral sentiments. Whereas the classical\ninterpretation construes his arguments as conceptual or logical in\nnature, the naturalistic interpretation presents Hume as concerned to\ndescribe the circumstances under which people are\nfelt to be responsible. Interpreted this way, Hume’s\narguments constitute a contribution to descriptive moral psychology\nand, as such, they are an important part of his wider program to\n“introduce the experimental method of reasoning into moral\nsubjects” (which is the subtitle of the Treatise). \nThe next question to consider is whether or not the issues that divide\nthe classical and naturalistic interpretations are of any contemporary\nsignificance or interest? The first thing to be said about this is\nthat from a contemporary perspective, classical compatibilism seems\ntoo crude an account of both freedom and moral responsibility and very\nfew philosophers would still press the claim that incompatibilist\nprejudices can be explained simply in terms of confusion about\nnecessity arising from a conflation between causation and compulsion.\nIn contrast with this, Hume’s concern with the role and\nrelevance of moral sentiment for our understanding of the free will\nproblem anticipates several key features of P.F.\nStrawson’s highly influential contribution to the contemporary\ndebate. Strawson’s “Freedom and Resentment”\n[hereafter FR] is arguably the most important and influential paper\nconcerning the free will problem published in the second half of the\ntwentieth century. The most striking affinity between the approaches\ntaken by Hume and Strawson is their shared appeal to the role of moral\nsentiments or reactive attitudes, which both use as a way of\ndiscrediting any supposed sceptical threat arising from the thesis of\ndeterminism. \nOn Strawson’s account, both classical compatibilists (whom he refers to\nas “optimists”) and libertarians (whom he refers to as\n“pessimists”, because they suppose determinism threatens\nmoral responsibility) make a similar mistake of\n“over-intellectualizing the facts” by seeking to provide\nsome sort of “external ‘rational’\njustification” for moral responsibility (FR, 81). The classical\ncompatibilist does this on the basis of a “one-eyed\nutilitarianism”, whereas the libertarian, seeing that something\nvital is missing from the classical compatibilist account, tries to\nplug the gap with “contra-causal freedom” – which\nStrawson describes as “a pitiful intellectualist trinket”\n(FR, 81). Against views of these kinds, Strawson argues that we should\nfocus our attention on the importance of reactive attitudes or moral\nsentiments in this context. By this means he hopes to find some middle\nground whereby he can “reconcile” the two opposing camps.\nOur reactive attitudes or moral sentiments, Strawson argues, should be\nunderstood in terms of our natural human emotional responses to the\nattitudes and intentions that human beings manifest towards each\nother. We expect and demand some degree of good will and due regard\nand we feel resentment or gratitude depending on whether or not this\nis shown to us (FR, 66–7). Granted that these emotions are part of our\nessential human make-up, and are naturally triggered or aroused in\nrelevant circumstances, it is still important to recognize that these\nresponses are in some measure under rational control and we can\n“modify or mollify” them in light of relevant\nconsiderations (FR, 68). \nThere are two kinds of consideration that Strawson distinguishes that\nmay require us to amend or withdraw our reactive attitudes. First,\nthere are considerations that we may describe as exemptions, where we\njudge that an individual is not an appropriate or suitable target of\nany reactive attitudes. These are cases where a person may be viewed\nas “psychologically abnormal” or “morally\nunderdeveloped” (FR, 68; and also 71–2). On the other hand, even\nwhere exemptions of this sort do not apply, ordinary excusing\nconsiderations may nevertheless require us to alter or change our\nparticular reactive attitudes as directed toward some individual (FR,\n68). Considerations of this kind include cases where an agent acts\naccidentally, or in ignorance, or was subject to physical force of\nsome kind. Where these considerations apply we may come to recognize\nthat the conduct in question, properly interpreted, does not lack the\ndegree of good will or due regard that we may demand. Even if some\ninjury has occurred, no malice or lack of regard has been shown to us.\nHowever, the crucial point for Strawson is that while our reactive\nattitudes may well be modified or withdrawn in these circumstances,\nthere is no question of us altogether abandoning or suspending our\nreactive attitudes (FR, 71–3). In particular, there is nothing about\nthe thesis of determinism that implies that either exemptions or\nexcuses, as Strawson has described them, apply or hold universally\n(FR, 70–1). Moreover, and more controversially, Strawson also\nmaintains that even if determinism did provide some\n“theoretical” basis for drawing this sceptical conclusion,\nany such policy is “for us as we are, practically\ninconceivable” (FR, 71). In other words, according to Strawson\nour natural commitment to the fabric of moral sentiment insulates us\nfrom any possible global sceptical threat to the whole fabric of moral\nresponsibility based on theoretical worries about the implications of\ndeterminism. \nIf we read Hume along the lines of the classical interpretation, then\nhis position on these issues looks as if it accords very closely with\nthe typical “optimist” strategy associated with such\nthinkers as Schlick. The classical interpretation, however, entirely\noverlooks the role of moral sentiment in Hume’s reconciling\nstrategy.  It emphasizes the relevance of the (supposed) confusion\nbetween causation and compulsion in order to explain the more\nfundamental confusion about the nature of liberty (i.e., why\nphilosophers tend to confuse liberty of spontaneity with liberty of\nindifference). With these features of Hume’s position\nestablished, the classical interpretation points to Hume’s\nremarks concerning the social utility of rewards and punishments and\nthe way in which they depend on the principles of necessity. From this\nperspective, Hume’s discussion of freedom and necessity clearly\nconstitutes a paradigmatic and influential statement of the\n“optimist’s” position. So interpreted, Hume must be\nread as a thinker, like Schlick, who has “over-intellectualized\nthe facts” on the basis of a\n“one-eyed-utilitarianism”; one who has ignored “that\ncomplicated web of attitudes and feelings” which Strawson seeks\nto draw our attention to. In this way, we are encouraged to view Hume\nas a prime target of Strawson’s attack on the\n“optimist” position. \nThe naturalistic interpretation, by contrast, makes it plain that any\nsuch view of Hume’s approach and general strategy is deeply mistaken.\nHume, no less than Strawson, is especially concerned to draw our\nattention to the facts about human nature that are relevant to a\nproper understanding of the nature and conditions of moral\nresponsibility. More specifically, Hume argues that we cannot properly\naccount for moral responsibility unless we acknowledge and describe\nthe role that moral sentiment plays in this sphere. Indeed, unlike\nStrawson, Hume is much more concerned with the detailed mechanism\nwhereby our moral sentiments are aroused, and thus he is particularly\nconcerned to explain the relevance of spontaneity, indifference, and\nnecessity to the functioning of moral sentiment. To this extent,\ntherefore, Hume’s naturalistic approach is more tightly woven into his\naccount of the nature of necessity and moral freedom. In sum, when we\ncompare Hume’s arguments with Strawson’s important and influential\ndiscussion, it becomes immediately apparent that there is considerable\ncontemporary significance to the contrast between the classical and\nnaturalistic interpretations of Hume’s reconciling strategy. \nThe overall resemblance between Hume’s and Strawson’s strategy in\ndealing with issues of freedom and responsibility is striking. The\nfundamental point that they agree about is that we cannot understand\nthe nature and conditions of moral responsibility without reference to\nthe crucial role that moral sentiment plays in this sphere. This\nnaturalistic approach places Hume and Strawson in similar positions\nwhen considered in relation to the views of the pessimist and the\noptimist. The naturalistic approach shows that, in different ways,\nboth sides of the traditional debate fail to properly acknowledge the\nfacts about moral sentiment. Where Hume most noticeably differs from\nStrawson, however, is on the question of the “general\ncauses” of moral sentiment. Strawson largely bypasses this\nproblem. For Hume, this is a crucial issue that must be settled to\nunderstand why necessity is essential to responsibility and why\nindifference is entirely incompatible with the effective operation of\nthe mechanism that responsibility depends on. \nWe have noted that the classical and naturalistic interpretations\ndiffer in how they account for the relationship between freedom and\nresponsibility. According to the classical interpretation\nresponsibility may be analysed directly in terms of free action, where\nthis is understood simply in terms of an agent acting according to her\nown will or desires. While classical compatibilists reject the\nincompatibilist suggestion that free and responsible action requires\nindeterminism or any special form of “moral causation”\nthey are, nevertheless, both agreed that a person can be held\nresponsible if and only if she acts freely. On the naturalistic\ninterpretation, however, Hume rejects this general doctrine, which we\nmay call “voluntarism”. \nHume maintains that it is a matter of “the utmost\nimportance” for moral philosophy that action must be indicative\nof durable qualities of mind if a person is to be held\naccountable for it (T 3.3.1.4/575). This claim is part of\nHume’s more general claim that our indirect passions (including\nour moral sentiments) are aroused and sustained only when the\npleasurable or painful qualities concerned (e.g. the virtues and\nvices) stand in a durable or constant relation with the person who is\ntheir object (T 2.1.6.7/292–3; DP 2.11). In the case of\nactions, which are “temporary and perishing”, no such\nlasting relation is involved unless action is suitably tied to\ncharacter traits of some kind. Two important issues arise out of this\nthat need to be carefully distinguished. \n(1) Does Hume hold that all aspects of virtue for which a person is\nsubject to moral evaluation (i.e., approval and disapproval) must be\nvoluntarily expressed? That is to say, are virtues and vices to be\nassessed entirely on the basis of an agent’s deliberate choices\nand intentional actions?  \n(2) Granted that virtues and vices are to be understood in terms of a\nperson’s pleasant or painful qualities of mind, to what extent\nare these traits of character voluntarily acquired (i.e., acquired\nthrough the agent’s own will and choices)? \nHume’s answer to both questions is clear. He denies that\nvoluntary or intentional action is the sole basis on which we may\nassess a person’s virtues and vices. Furthermore he also\nmaintains that moral character is, for the most part, involuntarily\nacquired. The second claim does not, of course, commit him to the\nfirst. Nor does the first commit him to the second, since a person\ncould voluntarily acquire traits that, once acquired, may be\ninvoluntarily expressed or manifest. Plainly the combination of claims\nthat Hume embraces on this issue commits him to a position that\nradically deflates the significance and importance of voluntariness in\nrelation to virtue – certainly in comparison with some familiar\nalternative accounts (e.g. as in Aristotle). \nLet us consider, first, the relevance of voluntariness to the\nexpression of character. As we have already noted, Hume does take the\nview that actions serve as the principal way in which we learn about a\nperson’s character (T 3.3.1.5/575). Action is produced by the\ncausal influence of our desires and willings. The interpretation and\nevaluation of action must, therefore, take note of the particular\nintention with which an action was undertaken. Failing this, we are\nliable to attribute character traits to the agent that he does not\npossess (and consequently unjustly praise or blame him). Although\nintention and action do have a significant and important role to play\nin the assessment of moral character, Hume also maintains that there\nare other channels through which character may be expressed. More\nspecifically, a virtuous or vicious character can be distinguished by\nreference to a person’s “wishes and sentiments,” as\nwell as by the nature of the person’s will (T 3.3.1.5/575).\nFeelings, desires and sentiments manifest themselves in a wide variety\nof ways – not just through willing and acting. A person’s\n“countenance and conversation” (T 2.1.11.3/317),\ndeportment or “carriage” (EU 8.15/88), gestures (EU\n8.9/85), or simply her look and expression, may all serve as signs of\ncharacter and qualities of mind that may be found to be pleasant or\npainful. Although we may enjoy some limited degree of control over our\ndesires and passions, as well as how they are expressed, for the most\npart our emotional states and attitudes arise in us involuntarily and\nmay even be manifest or expressed against our will.  \nWe may now turn to the further question concerning Hume’s\nunderstanding of the way in which virtues and vices are\nacquired and, in particular, to what extent they are shaped\nand conditioned by our own choices. It is Hume’s view that, by\nand large, our character is conditioned and determined by factors\nindependent of our will. In the sections “Of liberty and\nnecessity” (T 2.3.1–2; EU 8) he argues that not only do\nwe observe how certain characters will act in specific circumstances,\nwe also observe how circumstances condition character. Among the\nfactors that determine character, he claims, are bodily condition,\nage, sex, occupation and social station, climate, religion,\ngovernment, and education (T 2.3.1.5–10/401–03; EU\n8.7–15/83–8; see esp. EU 8.11/85–6: “Are the\nmanners ...”). These various causal influences account for\n“the diversity of characters, prejudices, and opinions”\n(EU 8.10/85). Any accurate moral philosophy, it is argued, must\nacknowledge and take note of the forces that “mould the human\nmind from its infancy” and which account for “the gradual\nchange in our sentiments and inclinations” through time (EU\n8.11/86). The general force of these observations is to establish that\n“the fabric and constitution of our mind no more depends on our\nchoice, than that of our body” (ESY 168; see also T\n3.3.4.3/608; ESY 140, 160, 579).  \nCritics of Hume’s position on this subject will argue that if a\nperson has little or no control over the factors that shape her\ncharacter then virtue and vice really would be, in these\ncircumstances, matters of mere good or bad fortune and no more a basis\nfor moral concern than bodily beauty or ugliness. (See Reid 1969:\n261: “What was, by an ancient author, said of\nCato…”.) If people are responsible for the character that\ntheir actions and feelings express, then they must have acquired that\ncharacter voluntarily.  Hume’s reply to this line of criticism\nis that we can perfectly well distinguish virtue and vice without\nmaking any reference to the way that character is acquired. Our moral\nsentiments are reactions or responses to the moral qualities and\ncharacter traits that people manifest in their behavior and conduct,\nand thus need not be withdrawn simply because people do not choose or\nvoluntarily acquire these moral characteristics. Hume does recognize,\nof course, that we do have some limited ability to amend and alter our\ncharacter. In particular, Hume acknowledges that we can cultivate and\nimprove our moral character, in some measure, through self-criticism\nand self-understanding.  Nevertheless, the points he emphasizes are\nthat all such efforts are limited in their scope and effect (ESY 169)\nand that, beyond this, “a man must be, before-hand, tolerably\nvirtuous” for such efforts of “reformation” to be\nundertaken in the first place. \nHume’s views about the relationship between virtue and\nvoluntariness do much to explain one of the most controversial aspects\nof his theory of virtue: his view that the natural abilities should be\nincorporated into the virtues and vices (T 3.3.4; EM App 4). With\nrespect to this issue he makes two key points. The first is that\nnatural abilities (i.e., intelligence, imagination, memory, wit, etc.)\nand moral virtues more narrowly understood are “equally mental\nqualities” (T 3.3.4.1/606). Second, both of them “equally\nproduce pleasure” and thus have “an equal tendency to\nproduce the love and esteem of mankind” (T 3.3.4.1/606–07). In\ncommon life, people “naturally praise or blame whatever pleases\nor displeases them and thus regard penetration as much a virtue as\njustice” (T 3.3.4.4/609). (See, e.g., Hume’s sardonic\nobservation at EM App. 4.5/315: “It is hard to tell...”)\nBeyond all this, as already noted, any distinction between the natural\nabilities and moral virtues cannot be based on the consideration that\nthe natural abilities are for the most part involuntarily acquired,\nsince this also holds true for the moral virtues more narrowly\nconceived. It is, nevertheless, Hume’s view that the\nvoluntary/involuntary distinction helps to explain “why\nmoralists have invented” the distinction between natural\nabilities and moral virtues. Unlike moral qualities, natural abilities\n“are almost invariable by any art or industry” (T\n3.3.4.4/609). In contrast with this, moral qualities, “or at\nleast, the actions that proceed from them, may be chang’d by the\nmotives of rewards and punishments, praise and blame” (T\n3.3.4.4/609). In this way, according to Hume, the significance of the\nvoluntary/involuntary distinction is largely limited to our concern\nwith the regulation of conduct in society. To confine our\nunderstanding of virtue and vice to these frontiers is, however, to\ndistort and misrepresent its very nature and foundation in human life\nand experience. (For more on Hume’s views on virtue in relation to his\nposition on free will see Russell, 2013.)  \nThese observations regarding Hume and the doctrine of voluntarism are\nof considerable relevance to the contemporary ethical debate as it\nconcerns what Bernard Williams has described as “the morality\nsystem” (Williams, 1985: Chp. 10). Although Williams’\n(hostile) account of the morality system is multifaceted and defies\neasy summary, its core features are clear enough. The concept that\nWilliams identifies as fundamental to the morality system is its\nspecial notion of obligation. Flowing from this special concept of\nobligation are the related concepts of right and wrong, blame and\nvoluntariness. When agents voluntarily violate their obligations they\ndo wrong and are liable to blame and some measure of retribution. To\nthis extent the morality system, so conceived, involves what Williams\ncalls “the blame system”, which focuses on particular acts\n(Williams, 1985: 194). According to Williams there is pressure within\nthe blame system “to require a voluntariness that will be total\nand will cut through character and psychological or social\ndeterminism, and allocate blame and responsibility on the ultimately\nfair basis of the agent’s own contribution, no more and no\nless” (Williams, 1985: 194). \nOne reason why the morality system places great weight on the\nimportance of voluntariness is that it aspires to show that morality\n – and moral responsibility in particular – somehow\n“transcends luck” (Williams, 1985: 195). This is required\nto ensure that blame is allocated in a way that is “ultimately\nfair”. Despite the obvious challenges this requirement poses,\ncompatibilists have typically tried to satisfy these aspiration of the\nmorality system by way of offering a variety of argument to show that\ncompatibilist commitments do not render us vulnerable to the play of\nfate or luck in our moral lives (e.g. Dennett, 1984). Hume, however,\nmakes little effort to satisfy these aspirations. (A point that\nWilliams notes in Williams, 1995: 20n12.) In the final analysis, Hume\nclaims, just as every body or material object “is\ndetermin’d by an absolute fate to a certain degree and direction\nof its motion, and can no more depart from that precise line, in which\nit moves, than it can convert itself into an angel, or spirit, or any\nsuperior substance” (T 2.3.1.3/400), so too our conduct and\ncharacter is similarly subject to an “absolute fate” as\nunderstood in terms of the inescapable “bonds of\nnecessity” (T 2.3.2.2/408). In these fundamental respects,\ntherefore, Hume takes the view, along with Williams, that morality\ndoes not elude either fate or luck. In this Hume, perhaps, shares more\nwith the ancient Greeks than he does with those moderns who embrace\nthe aspirations of the morality system (see, e.g., Williams,\n1993). \nFrom a critical perspective, it may be argued that there remains a\nsignificant gap in Hume’s scheme as we have so far described it.\nEven if we discard the aspirations of the morality system, any\ncredible naturalistic theory of moral responsibility needs to be able\nto provide some account of the sorts of moral capacity involved in\nexempting conditions, whereby we deem some individuals and\nnot others as appropriate targets of moral sentiments or\n“reactive attitudes”. As it stands, what Hume has to say\non this subject is plainly inadequate. According to Hume, it is an\nultimate inexplicable fact about our moral sentiments (qua calm forms\nof the indirect passions of love and hate) that they are always\ndirected at people, either ourselves or others. This account leaves us\nunable say why some people are not appropriate objects of\nmoral sentiments (e.g. children, the insane, and so on). There are,\nhowever, several available proposals for dealing with this gap.\nPerhaps the most influential proposal is to adopt some general theory\nof reason-responsiveness or rational self-control. According to\naccounts of this kind, responsible agents need to have control over\ntheir actions, where this involves performing “those actions\nintentionally, while possessing the relevant sorts of normative\ncompetence: the general ability to grasp moral requirements and to\ngovern one’s conduct by light of them” (Wallace, 1994:\n86). While proposals of this general kind help to plug a large gap in\nHume’s theory, they also suggest a particular understanding of\nmoral responsibility that is not entirely in keeping with Hume’s\nown account. \nThere are two points of divergence that are especially significant\nwith respect to to issue. First, rational self-control may be\nexplained, as it is on Wallace’s account, in terms of\nspecifically Kantian conceptions of practical reason and moral agency\n(Wallace, 1994: 12–17). Even if commitments of this kind are\navoided, theories of this kind are still too narrowly based on moral\ncapacity as it relates solely to actions and intentions. On\nHume’s account, moral capacity must be related to wider patterns\nand dispositions of feeling, desire and character. The scope of moral\nevaluation should not be reduced or limited to concern with (fleeting and\nmomentary) acts of will modelled after legal paradigms. Moral capacity\nmust be exercised and manifest in a larger and more diverse set of\npropensities and abilities that make up moral character, including the\noperation of moral sentiment itself. \nSecond, and related to the previous point, although Hume does not\nprovide any substantial or robust theory of moral capacity, it is\npossible to find, within what he provides, material that suggests a\nless “rationalistic” understanding of moral capacity. It\nmay be argued, for example, that in Hume’s system there is an\nintimate and important relationship between moral sense and virtue.\nOur moral sense should be understood in terms of our general capacity\nto feel and direct moral sentiments at both ourselves and at others.\nHume points out that children acquire the artificial virtues,\ninvolving the conventions of justice, by way not only of learning\ntheir advantages but also learning to feel the relevant moral\nsentiments when these conventions are violated (T\n3.2.3.26/500–01). The mechanism of the moral sentiments both\ncultivates and maintains the artificial virtues. Hume has less to say\nabout the role of moral sentiment in relation to the natural virtues\nbut similar observations would seem to apply. As children grow up and\nmature they become increasingly aware that their qualities of\ncharacter affect both others and themselves and that these will\ninevitably give rise to moral sentiments in the people they will deal\nwith. This entire process of becoming aware of the moral sentiments of\nothers, and “surveying ourselves as we appear to others”\n(T 3.3.1.8, 3.3.1.26, 3.3.1.30, 3.3.6.6/576–7, 589, 591, 620;\nEM 9.10, App. 4.3/276, 314) surely serves to develop the natural as\nwell as the artificial virtues. Along these lines, Hume maintains that\nthis disposition to “survey ourselves” and seek our own\n“peace and satisfaction” is the surest guardian of every\nvirtue (EM 9.10/276). Any person who entirely lacks this disposition\nwill be shameless and will inevitably lack all the virtues that depend\non moral reflection for their development and stability. \nIf this conjecture regarding the intimate or internal relationship\nbetween virtue and moral sense is correct, then it does much to\nexplain and account for the range of exemptions that are required in\nthis area. Hume’s understanding of the operation of moral\nsentiment is not simply a matter of enjoying pleasant and painful\nfeelings of a peculiar kind (T 3.1.2.4/472). On the contrary, the\nmoral evaluation of character involves the activity of both reason and\nsentiment. The sort of intellectual activities required include not\nonly learning from experience the specific pleasant and painful\ntendencies of certain kinds of character and conduct, as well as the\nability to distinguish accurately among them, but also the ability to\nevaluate character and conduct from “some steady and general\npoint of view” (T 3.3..15/581–2; EM\n5.41–2/227–8). Clearly, then, insofar as the cultivation\nand stability of virtue depends on moral sense, it also requires the\nintellectual qualities and capacities involved in the exercise of\nmoral sense. (One way of understanding this is to say that moral sense\nand moral reflection serve as the counterparts to practical wisdom or\nphronesis in Aristotle’s moral theory. See Russell, 2006.)\nGiven this, an animal, an infant, or an insane person will lack the\nability to perform the intellectual tasks involved in the production\nof moral sentiment. We cannot, therefore, expect virtues that are\ndependent on these abilities and intellectual activities to be\nmanifest in individuals who lack them, or when they are damaged or\nunderdeveloped. \nInterpreting Hume in these terms not only serves to fill\nwhat looks like a large gap in his naturalistic program, it also\navoids distorting his own wider ethical commitments by imposing a\nnarrower, rationalistic conception of moral capacity into his\nnaturalistic framework. Beyond this, interpreting moral capacity in\nthese more sentimentalist terms is both philosophically and\npsychologically more satisfying and plausible. On an account of this\nkind, there exists a close and essential relationship between being\nresponsible, where this is understood in terms of being an\nappropriate target of moral sentiments or reactive attitudes, and\nbeing able to hold oneself and others responsible, where this\nis understood as the ability to experience and entertain moral\nsentiments. It is a merit of Hume’s system, so interpreted, that\nit avoids “over-intellectualizing” not only what is\ninvolved in holding a person responsible, but also what is involved in\nbeing a responsible agent. \nIn the Treatise, as was noted earlier, Hume argues that one\nof the reasons “why the doctrine of liberty [of indifference]\nhas generally been better receiv’d in the world, than its antagonist\n[the doctrine of necessity], proceeds from religion, which has been\nvery unnecessarily interested in this question” (T\n2.3.2.3/409). He goes on to argue “that the doctrine of\nnecessity, according to my explication of it, is not only innocent,\nbut even advantageous to religion and morality”. When Hume came\nto present his views afresh in the Enquiry (Sec. 8), he was\nless circumspect about his hostile intentions with regard to\n“religion”. In the parallel passage (EU\n8.26/96–97), he again objects to any effort to refute a\nhypothesis “by a pretence to its dangerous consequences to\nreligion and morality”. He goes on to say that his\naccount of the doctrines of liberty and necessity “are not only\nconsistent with morality, but are absolutely essential to its\nsupport” (EU 8.26/97). By this means, he makes it\nclear that he is not claiming that his position is\n“consistent” with religion. In the final passages of the\nEnquiry discussion of liberty and necessity (EU\n8.32–6/99–103) – passages which do not appear in the\noriginal Treatise discussion – Hume makes it plain\nexactly how his necessitarian principles have “dangerous\nconsequences for religion”. \nHume considers the following objection: \nIn other words, the doctrine of necessity produces an awkward dilemma\nfor the theological position: Either the distinction between (moral)\ngood and evil collapses, because everything is produced by a perfect\nbeing who intends “nothing but what is altogether good and\nlaudable” (EU 8.33/101), or we must “retract the\nattribute of perfection, which we ascribe to the Deity” on the\nground that he is the ultimate author of moral evil in the world. \nHume treats the first horn of this dilemma at greatest length. He\ndraws on his naturalistic principles to show that the conclusion\nreached (i.e., that no human actions are evil or criminal in nature)\nis absurd. There are, he claims, both physical and moral evils in this\nworld that the human mind finds naturally painful, and this affects\nour sentiments accordingly. Whether we are the victim of gout or of\nrobbery, we naturally feel the pain of such evils (EU\n8.34/101–2). No “remote speculations” or\n“philosophical theories” concerning the good or perfection\nof the whole universe will alter these natural reactions and responses\nto the particular ills and evils we encounter. Hence, even if we were\nto grant that this is indeed the best of all possible worlds – and\nHume clearly takes the view that we have no reason to suppose that it\nis (D 113–4; EU 11.15–22/137–42) – this would\ndo nothing to undermine the reality of the distinction we draw between\ngood and evil (i.e., as experienced on the basis of “the natural\nsentiments of the human mind”: EU 8.35/103). \nWhat, then, of the alternative view, that God is “the ultimate\nauthor of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures”? Hume\noffers two rather different accounts of this\nalternative – although he does not distinguish them properly. He\nbegins by noting that if some human actions “have any turpitude,\nthey must involve our Creator in the same guilt, while he is\nacknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author” (EU\n8.32/100). This passage suggests that God is also\nblameworthy for criminal actions in this world, since he is their\n“ultimate author”. At this point, however, there is no\nsuggestion that the particular human agents who commit these crimes\n(as preordained by God) are not accountable for them. In the passage\nthat follows this is the position taken. \nHume goes on to argue that this rule of morality has even\n“greater force” when applied to God, since he is neither\nignorant nor impotent and must, therefore, have knowingly produced\nthose criminal actions which are manifest in the world. Granted that\nsuch actions are indeed criminal, it follows, says Hume, “that\nthe Deity, not man, is accountable for them” (EU 8.32/100; cf.\nEU 8.33/101). \nIt is evident that Hume is arguing two points. First, if God is the\ncreator of the world and preordained and predetermined everything that\nhappens in it, then the (obvious) existence of moral evil is\nattributable to him, and thus “we must retract the attribute of\nperfection” which we ascribe to him. Second, if God is indeed\nthe ultimate author of moral evil, then no individual human being is\naccountable for the criminal actions he performs. The second claim\ndoes not follow from the first. Moreover, it is clearly inconsistent\nwith Hume’s general position on this subject. As has been noted, in\nthis same context, Hume has also argued that no speculative\nphilosophical theory can alter the natural workings of our moral\nsentiments. The supposition that God is the “ultimate\nauthor” of all that takes place in the world will not, on this\nview of things, change our natural disposition to praise or blame our\nfellow human beings. Whatever the ultimate causes of a person’s\ncharacter and conduct, it will (inevitably) arouse a sentiment of\npraise or blame in other humans who contemplate it. This remains the\ncase even if we suppose that God also deserves blame for the\n“moral turpitude” we find in the world. In general, then,\nHume’s first formulation of the second alternative (i.e., that God\nmust share the blame for those crimes that occur in the\nworld) is more consistent with his naturalistic principles. \nWhat is crucial to Hume’s polemical purpose in these passages is\nnot the thesis that if God is the author of crimes then his human\ncreations are not accountable for them. Rather, the point Hume is\nconcerned to make (since he does not, in fact, doubt the\ninescapability of our moral accountability to our fellow human beings)\nis that the religious hypothesis leads to the “absurd\nconsequence” that God is the ultimate author of sin in this\nworld and that he is, accordingly, liable to some appropriate measure\nof blame. Hume, in other words, takes the (deeply impious) step of\nshowing that if God exists, and is the creator of the universe, then\nhe is no more free of sin than human beings are. According to Hume, we\nmust judge God as we judge human beings, on the basis of his effects\nin the world, and we must then adjust our sentiments accordingly.\nIndeed, there is no other natural or reasonable basis on which to\nfound our sentiments toward God. In certain respects, therefore, we\ncan make better sense of how we (humans) can hold God accountable than\nwe can make sense of how God is supposed to hold humans accountable\n(i.e., since we have no knowledge of his sentiments, or even\nif he has any; cf. D 58,114,128–9; ESY 594; but see also LET\nI/51). It is, of course, Hume’s considered view that it is an\negregious error of speculative theology and philosophy to suppose that\nthe universe has been created by a being that bears some (close)\nresemblance to humankind. The question of the origin of the universe\nis one that Hume plainly regards as beyond the scope of human reason\n(see, e.g., EU\n1.11–2;11.15–23;11.26–7;12.2634/11–13,\n137–42, 144–47, 165; D 36–8,88–9,107).\nNevertheless, Hume’s point is plain: On the basis of the\n(limited) evidence that is available to us, we must suppose that if\nthere is a God, who is creator of this world and who orders all that\ntakes place in it, then this being is indeed accountable for all the\n(unnecessary and avoidable; D 107) evil that we discover in it. \nAlthough it is evident that Hume’s discussion of free will in\nthe first Enquiry is part of his wider critique of the\nChristian religion, it is nevertheless widely held that Hume’s\nearlier discussion “Of liberty and necessity” in the\nTreatise carries none of this irreligious content or\nsignificance. This view is itself encouraged by a more general\nunderstanding of the relationship between the Treatise and\nthe first Enquiry which maintains that the Treatise\nlacks any significant irreligious content (because Hume\n“castrated” his work and removed most passages of this\nkind, perhaps including the passages at EU 8.32–6). On this\nview of things, the elements of Hume’s discussion that are\ncommon to both Treatise 2.3.1–2 and Enquiry 8\nare themselves without any particular religious or irreligious\nsignificance. To show why this view is seriously mistaken would,\nhowever, take us wide of our present concerns. (For a more detailed\naccount of Hume’s fundamental irreligious intentions throughout\nthe Treatise see Russell, 2008 and also Russell, 2016.)  \nSuffice it to note, for our present purposes, that throughout\nhis writings, Hume’s philosophical interests and concerns were\nvery largely dominated and directed by his fundamental irreligious\naims and objectives. A basic theme in Hume’s philosophy, so\nconsidered, is his effort to demystify moral and social life and\nrelease it from the metaphysical trappings of\n“superstition”. The core thesis of Hume’s\nTreatise – indeed, of his overall (irreligious or\n“atheistic”) philosophical outlook – is that moral\nand social life neither rests upon nor requires the dogmas of\nChristian metaphysics. Hume’s naturalistic framework for understanding\nmoral and social life excludes not only the metaphysics of\nlibertarianism (e.g., modes of “moral” causation by\nimmaterial agents) but also all further theologically inspired\nmetaphysics that generally accompanies it (i.e., God, the immortal\nsoul, a future state, and so on). The metaphysics of religion, Hume\nsuggests, serves only to confuse and obscure our understanding of\nthese matters and to hide their true foundation in human nature.\nHume’s views on the subject of free will and moral responsibility, as\npresented in the sections “Of liberty and necessity” and\nelsewhere in his writings, are the very pivot on which this\nfundamental thesis turns.","contact.mail":"paul.russell@ubc.ca","contact.domain":"ubc.ca"}]
