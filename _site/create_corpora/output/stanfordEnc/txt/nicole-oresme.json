His work provided some\nbasis for the development of modern mathematics and science.\nFurthermore he is generally considered the greatest medieval economist.\nBy translating, at the behest of King Charles V of France, Aristotle’s\nEthics, Politics, and On the Heavens, as\nwell as the pseudo-Aristotelian Economics, from Latin into\nFrench, he exerted a considerable influence on the development of\nFrench prose, particularly its scientific and philosophical\nvocabulary.\n\n\n\nNicole Oresme was born around 1320 in the diocese of Bayeux in\nNormandy, possibly in the village of Allemagne (now Fleury-sur-Orne) on\nthe outskirts of the Norman city of Caen (Burton 2007, 6). By 1341/42\nhe had obtained his master of arts at the University of Paris and was\nprobably teaching philosophy there (Courtenay 2000, 544; Burton 2007,\n7). In 1348 his name appears on a list of graduate scholarship holders\nin theology at the College of Navarre at the University of Paris.\nOresme became Grand Master of the College in 1356, so he must have\ncompleted his doctorate in theology before this date. Oresme held this\nposition till 1362 and was teaching master in the faculty of theology\nduring that time (Burton 2007, 10). \n\nFrom 1362, when he left the university, until his death in 1382,\nOresme served Charles, the dauphin of France, who was regent during\nhis father’s captivity (1356–1364) and was crowned King Charles\nV on his father’s death (1364) (Burton 2007, 10). Oresme was appointed\ncanon (1362) and later dean (1364) of the Cathedral of Rouen and also\ncanon at Sainte-Chapelle in Paris (1363) (Clagett 1974, 223). Oresme\nwas elected bishop of Lisieux in 1377 and was consecrated in 1378. He\ndied on July 11, 1382. \n\nOne of the most interesting features in Oresme’s Commentary on\nAristotle’s Physics is his view on the ontological status of\naccidents. Characteristic of Oresme’s view on accidents is that he\ndoes not consider them accidental forms, but only\nso-called condiciones or modi (se habendi)\nof the substance. But this does not mean that Oresme identifies\naccidents with the substance in the way that Ockham had identified the\nquantity of a substance with the substance itself. Rather, Oresme\nregards accidents as distinct from the substance, but he assigns them\na lower ontological status than the commonly accepted accidental\nforms. For Oresme motion, being-in-a-place (esse in loco),\nthe quantity of a substance, its esse tantam, and qualities\n(such as the esse album of a substance) are\nsuch condiciones or modi (Celeyrette/Mazet 1998;\nCaroti 2000; Caroti 2001; Caroti 2004; Mazet 2000; Kirschner 1997,\n52–61, 73–76, 121, 141–142; Kirschner, 2000b,\npp. 263–272). \n\nTo a certain degree Oresme’s theory of the ontological status of\naccidents is reminiscent of Adam Wodeham’s (c. 1298–1358) and\nGregory of Rimini’s (c. 1300–1358) theory of complexly\nsignifiables (complexe significabilia) (Adam de Wodeham 1990,\ndist. 1, qu. 1, 180–208; Gregory of Rimini 1981, Prologus,\nqu. 1, artic. 1–3, 1–40; Nuchelmans 1973, 227–242;\nBiard 2004; Conti 2004; Gaskin 2004). On some occasions Oresme\nexplicitly uses the expression ‘complexe significabile’ in\nthe framework of his ontology of accidents. However, despite these\nsimilarities between Oresme’s ontology of accidents and the theory of\ncomplexly signifiables it seems that this connection is of a secondary\nnature. For Oresme the determination of the ontological status of\naccidents is in the foreground, while Adam Wodeham and Gregory of\nRimini had quite another aim. They wanted to determine what the object\nof knowledge is. Their solution that the significatum totale\nor significatum adaequatum of a conclusion or proposition is the\nobject of knowledge is not confined to conclusions or propositions\nconcerning accidents, such as ‘homo est albus’,\nwhose significatum totale is hominem esse album (which\nitself is a significabile per complexum). Rather, their\nsolution applies to any kind of conclusion or proposition: for\ninstance, ‘Deus est’ or ‘homo est animal’.\nNeither Adam Wodeham nor Gregory of Rimini made any attempt to identify\naccidents with the correspondent complexly signifiables such as\n‘hominem esse album’. Oresme does not derive the\nontological status of accidents from their being complexly\nsignifiables. Instead, the converse is true: given that Oresme\nrejects the traditional view that accidents are accidental forms, he\nmust avoid the use of substantives in denominating the ontological\nstatus of accidents and thus quasi-automatically arrives at\nformulations that are characteristic of the theory of complexly\nsignifiables.  There were only very few authors since late antiquity – that\nis, since Simplicius (b. c. 500, d. after 533) and his contemporary\nJohn Philoponus – who rejected Aristotle’s definition of place\nas the innermost surface of the surrounding body. In his Commentary on\nAristotle’s Physics Oresme argued for the non-Aristotelian position\nthat the (physical) place of a body is the space filled or occupied by\nthe body (Kirschner 1997, 101, 116–123; Kirschner 2000a,\n146–159). Prior to Oresme Geraldus Odonis (c. 1290–1349)\n(Bakker/de Boer 2009; Robert 2012, 85–90), Walter Chatton\n(c. 1290–1343) (Robert 2012, 83–85) and William Crathorn\n(fl. 1330s) (Robert 2012, 90–94) held the same view. It remains\nunknown whether their arguments exerted a direct influence on\nOresme. Another anti-Aristotelian theory of place was propounded by\nPetrus Aureoli (c. 1280–1322). Aureoli held that place is the\ndeterminate position of the located body in the universe (Schabel\n2000, 126–138; Robert 2012, 79-82). \n\nIn stating that the place of a body is the space filled or occupied by\nit Oresme does not merely revive an opinion of Greek antiquity; he can\nalso be regarded, together with philosophers like Gianfrancesco Pico\ndella Mirandola (1469–1533) (Grant 1981, 275–276, n. 63),\nFrancesco Patrizi (1529–1597) (Grant 1981, 201; Schmitt 1967,\n143), and Giordano Bruno (1548–1600) (Grant 1981, 186–187;\nSchmitt 1967, 142–143), as a precursor of Newton\n(1643–1727) in the theory of place and absolute space. None the\nless, despite the close resemblance that Oresme’s view of place and\nspace bears to Newton’s, there are characteristic differences\nconcerning the ontological status of space. \n\nFor Oresme space is neither substance nor accident. It is nothing that\ncan be signified by a noun or pronoun, but only by adverbs like\n‘here’ and ‘there’. That means that space is\nnot absolutely non-existent, but it has by no means the high\nontological status accorded to it by Newton. While for Newton space\napproaches more nearly to the nature of substance than of accident,\nfor Oresme it ranks on a far lower ontological level than an accident\n(Kirschner 1997, 103–104; Kirschner 2000a, 163–164). \n\nAnother central conclusion that Oresme draws in his Physics Commentary\nin his discussion of the nature of place is that beyond the world,\nthat is, outside the last sphere, there exists an infinite void\nspace. Oresme’s conception of an extracosmic infinite void space is\nwell known from other works by him (Le livre du ciel et du\nmonde, Questiones super De celo) (Kirschner 2000a,\n164–168). Besides Oresme there were few medieval philosophers\nwho assumed the existence of an infinite void space beyond the\nworld. The Jewish philosopher Hasdai Crescas (c. 1340–1410/11)\n(Crescas 1929, 189; Grant 1969, 50, n. 50; Grant 1981, 271, n. 33,\n321, n. 5), Thomas Bradwardine (c. 1290–1349) (Grant 1969,\n44–47; Grant 1981, 135–144), Robert Holkot (d. 1349)\n(Grant 1981, 350, n. 130) and William Crathorn (fl. 1330s) (Robert\n2012, 77, n. 2) may be mentioned among them. \n\nOresme also speaks of the immensity which is outside the Heavens and\nidentifies this immensity – by which he undoubtedly means the\nextracosmic void space – with God himself. This identification\nof the infinite void space with God is a characteristic feature of\nOresme’s natural philosophy or theology (Kirschner 1997,\n105–106; Kirschner 2000a, 168). According to Wolfson (1929,\n123), Crescas did not identify the infinite void outside the world\nwith God’s immensity; nor does Bradwardine seem to have held such a\nview (Maier 1966, 315, n. 18; Grant 1981, 142). The same applies\nto Robert Holkot (Grant 1981, 350, n. 130) and William Crathorn. \n\nWhat has just been said about Oresme’s rejection of Aristotelian\ntenets on the nature of place is also true for his theory of time.\nAristotle defines time as the number (that is, the measure) of motion\nwith respect to before and after. Thus he deduces the existence of\ntime from the existence of motion, which means that time is nothing\nindependent of motion. In contrast to Aristotle, Oresme in his Physics\nCommentary defines time as the successive duration of things\n(duratio rerum successiva, also duratio successiva\nrerum or rerum duratio successiva), that is, the\nduration of the actual existence of things. By deducing his concept of\ntime from the duration of things, which duration is prior to and\nindependent of motion, Oresme clearly deviates from Aristotle’s point\nof view and the conventional manner in which this topic was discussed\namong medieval scholastics (Kirschner 2000a, 171–176; Zanin\n2000, 257–259; Caroti 2001). \n\nAmong the few who opposed Aristotle’s doctrine of time was Petrus\nJohannis Olivi (b. c. 1248, d. 1298), who criticized Aristotle for\nregarding motion, rather than the actual existence of things, as the\nsubject of time (Maier 1955, 110–111). The Franciscan Gerardus\nOdonis (c. 1290–1349) was also a proponent of the independence\nof time from motion (Maier 1955, 134–137). Oresme’s theory of\ntime foreshadows that of classical physics to a certain degree, but,\nas is true of place and space, there are certain differences\nconcerning the ontological status of time (Kirschner 2000a,\n176–178). \n\nOresme states that the duration of things without any succession is\neternity, which he defines as duratio rerum tota simul. As\nwith the relation between God and extramundane space, Oresme identifies\neternity with God himself (Kirschner 2000a, 178–179). \n\nIn his commentary on Aristotle’s Physics Oresme presents a detailed\nand elaborate discussion of the ontological status of motion, one of\nthe fundamental problems of medieval natural philosophy. His theory of\nmotion is highly specific and turns out to be an application of his\ncharacteristic condicio-theory of accidents (Caroti 1993;\nCaroti 1994; Kirschner 1997, 52–78; Kirschner 2014). \n\nFor Oresme motion is a fluxus, a successive entity of its own\nthat exists in addition to the mobile and the things that are acquired\nduring motion. This is a clear departure from the nominalistic\nposition. Concerning its ontological status this fluxus is\nnot considered a separate accidental form but only a modus\n(se habendi) or a condicio of the mobile. Thus\nOresme circumvents the difficulties of a pure nominalistic approach,\nwhile simultaneously avoiding the problems that occur if one assigns\nthe fluxus the ontological status of an accidental form, as\nBuridan did in the case of local motion in his Physics commentary\n(ultima lectura) (Buridan, Questiones super octo\nPhisicorum libros Aristotelis, Qu. III.7,\nf. 50ra–51ra). Oresme’s own concept of fluxus is easily\napplicable to all types of motion, be they alterations, changes in\nquantity or local motions. Such a uniform concept of motion was one of\nhis major aims. Unfortunately, posterity does not seem to have\nappreciated his endeavour. Thus, at the University of Vienna in the\nsecond half of the 15th century it apparently became common to equate\nOresme’s concept of motion with Ockham’s view (Kirschner 2014). \n\nIn his Livre du ciel et du monde and in other works\n(Questiones super De celo, Questiones de spera)\nOresme brilliantly argues against any proof of the Aristotelian theory\nof a stationary Earth and a rotating sphere of the fixed stars.\nAlthough Oresme showed the possibility of a daily axial rotation of\nthe Earth, he finished by affirming his belief in a stationary Earth\n(Clagett 1974, 225). Similarly, Oresme proves the possibility of a\nplurality of worlds, but ultimately keeps to the Aristotelian tenet of\na single cosmos (Clagett 1974, 224–225; Harvey 2011). \n\nOresme was a determined opponent of astrology, which he attacked on\nreligious and scientific grounds. In De proportionibus\nproportionum Oresme first examined raising rational numbers to\nrational powers before extending his work to include irrational powers.\nThe results of both operations he termed irrational ratios,\nalthough he considered the first type commensurable with rational\nnumbers, and the latter not. His motivation for this study was a\nsuggestion of Thomas Bradwardine that the relationship between forces\n\\((F)\\), resistances \\((R)\\), and velocities \\((V)\\) is\nexponential (Grant 1966, 24–40; Clagett 1974, 224). In modern terms: \n\nOresme then asserted that the ratio of any two celestial motions is\nprobably incommensurable (Grant 1971, 67–77). This excludes\nprecise predictions of successively repeating conjunctions,\noppositions, and other astronomical aspects, and he subsequently\nclaimed, in Ad pauca respicientes (its name derives from the\nopening sentence “Concerning some matters …”), that\nastrology was thereby refuted (Grant 1966, 83–111). In\nhis Livre de divinacions and his\nTractatus contra astronomos Oresme tries to show that\nastrology is “most dangerous to those of high estate, such as\nprinces and lords to whom appertains the government of the\ncommonwealth” (Coopland 1952, 51). As with astrology, he fought\nagainst the widespread belief in occult and “marvelous”\nphenomena by explaining them in terms of natural causes. Oresme’s\nwritings against astrology and magic were due to his concern over the\nking’s and his court’s addiction to these practices. \n\nIn his De visione stellarum Oresme departs from the\nstandard view of earlier authors in optics such as Ptolemy\n(2nd century), Ibn al-Haytham (965–c. 1040), Roger Bacon\n(c. 1214–c. 1292), and Witelo (c. 1230/35–after 1275),\nwho all held that refraction can only occur at the interface of two\nmedia of differing densities and thus would not take place in a single\nmedium of uniformly varying density. He states – more than 300\nyears before Robert Hooke (1635–1703) and Newton – that\natmospheric refraction occurs along a curve and proposes to approximate\nthe curved path of a ray of light in a medium of uniformly varying\ndensity, in this case the atmosphere, by an infinite series of line\nsegments each representing a single refraction (Burton 2007, 33–64). \n\nOresme’s main contributions to mathematics are contained in his\nQuestiones super geometriam Euclidis and his Tractatus de\nconfigurationibus qualitatum et motuum. In these works Oresme\nconceived of the idea of using rectangular coordinates\n(latitudo and longitudo) and the resulting geometric\nfigures (configurationes) to distinguish between uniform and\nnonuniform distributions of various quantities, such as the change of\nvelocity in relation to time or the distribution of the intensities of\na quality in relation to the extension of the subject. In the\ndiscussion of motions the base line (longitudo) is the time,\nwhile the perpendiculars raised on the base line\n(latitudines) represent the velocity from instant to instant\nin the motion. Thus uniform acceleration is represented by a right\ntriangle. Oresme even extended his definition to include\nthree-dimensional figures (Clagett 1974, 226–228). Thus, he\nhelped lay the foundation that later led to the discovery of analytic\ngeometry by René Descartes (1596–1650). \n\nFurthermore, Oresme used his figures to give the first proof of the\nMerton theorem, discovered at Oxford in the 1330’s: the distance\ntraveled in any given period by a body moving under uniform\nacceleration is the same as if the body moved at a uniform speed equal\nto its speed at the midpoint of the period (Clagett 1974,\n225–226; Smorynski 2017, 216–222). Some scholars believe that Oresme’s graphical\nrepresentation of velocities was of great influence in the further\ndevelopment of kinematics, affecting in particular the work of Galileo\n(1564–1642). \n\nFurther noteworthy achievements in the field of mathematics are\nOresme’s geometric proofs of the sums of certain converging series,\nparticularly in his Questiones super geometriam Euclidis and\nhis Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum\n(Clagett 1974, 228). Most interestingly, Oresme seems to have given a\ngeneral rule of how to find the sum of all convergent series of the\nform: \nwith \\(a\\) being\nany quantity (aliqua quantitas) and \\(m\\) any natural\nnumber greater than or equal to 2 (cf. Murdoch 1964; Mazet 2003). He\ninforms us that we have to take the difference of two successive\nterms, that is \\(a/m^n - a/m^{n+1}\\), and divide it through the first\nof these terms, that is \\(a/m^n\\), so that we\nget: \nThe reverse of this fraction, i.e. \\(\\frac{m}{m-1}\\), will be the\nproportion of the sum of the whole series to the first term of the\nseries, \\(a\\). Thus, if we have the series \n\nto use Oresme’s own example, the sum will be 3/2 (Oresme,\nQuestiones super geometriam Euclidis, H. L. L. Busard (ed.),\n2010, Qu. 2, ll. 48–57). If \\(a\\) is 2, the sum will be\n3. Furthermore Oresme was the first to prove that the harmonic series \n\nis divergent by arguing that this series consists of an infinity of\nparts that are greater than \\(1/2\\), so that the whole is infinite. His\ndemonstration rests on the fact that the third and the fourth term\ntaken together \\((1/3 + 1/4)\\) are greater than \\(1/2\\), which also\napplies to the sum of the fifth through the eighth term \\(1/5 + 1/6 +\n1/7 + 1/8\\), which is greater than \\(4 \\times 1/8\\) and the sum of\nthe ninth through the 16th term and so on\n(Oresme, loc. cit., Qu. 2, ll. 58–68).\n\n \n\nOresme’s discussion of the infinite in his Physics Commentary is\nanother fascinating testimony to the originality of this outstanding\nmedieval philosopher. Oresme demonstrates by thought experiments that\nof two actual infinites neither is bigger or smaller than the other.\nOresme’s proof is somewhat reminiscent of Georg Cantor’s (1845–1918)\ndemonstration that certain infinite sets are equinumerous. Thus Oresme\nshows by the principle of one-to-one correspondence that the collection\nof odd natural numbers is not smaller than the collection of natural\nnumbers, because it is possible to count the odd natural numbers by the\nnatural numbers (Sesiano 1996; Kirschner 1997, 79–83, 88–92). \n\nOresme was not the first to use the principle of one-to-one\ncorrespondence in discussing the proporties of actual\ninfinites. Bradwardine, whose main aim was to refute Aristotle’s\nopinion that the world is eternal, applied the principle of one-to-one\ncorrespondence to show that two infinites would be equal or – in\nmodern terms – that an infinite subset is equal to the set of\nwhich it is a part (Bradwardine 1618, 121C–124C). On the other\nhand Bradwardine takes it for granted that an infinite subset is\nsmaller than the set of which it is a part. Thus he is of the opinion\nthat under the assumption of an eternal world that has no beginning\nthe multitude of all human souls, which until now have been created,\nmust be greater than the multitude of the male or the female souls\nalone (Bradwardine 1618, 132E–133A). From this contradiction\n– an infinite subset cannot be both smaller than and equal to\nthe set of which it is a part – Bradwardine draws the inference\nthat the eternity of the world is impossible (Thakkar 2009,\n626–629). \n\nUnlike Bradwardine, Oresme shows that of two actual infinites neither\nis greater or smaller than the other. This result is different from\nBradwardine’s, because Oresme’s result does not necessarily imply\nequality between actual infinites. Moreover Oresme shows that cases\ncan be conceived in which two infinites can be regarded as unequal,\nbut this unequality is not to be understood in the sense of\n‘smaller’ or ‘greater’ (Oresme does not\ncontradict himself), but rather in the sense of\n‘different’. Since comparable quantities are either equal\nto one another or one is smaller or greater than the other, Oresme\nconcludes that actual infinites are incomparable: that is, that\nnotions like ‘smaller’, ‘bigger’, and\n‘equal’ do not apply to infinites (Sesiano 1996; Kirschner\n1997, 79–83, 88–92). Oresme’s treatment of the infinite\nwas extensively used by Pierre Ceffons when he commented the\nSentences in Paris in 1348–1349 (Mazet 2004,\n175–182). \n\nOresme is generally considered the greatest medieval economist. He\npresented his economic ideas in commentaries on the Ethics,\nPolitics, and Economics, as well as an earlier\ntreatise, De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum,\nthe first comprehensive work upon money. In his De origine, natura,\njure et mutationibus monetarum, of which he himself made a French\ntranslation under the title Traictié de la premiere\ninvention des monnoies, Oresme argued that coinage belongs to the\npublic, not to the prince, who has no right to vary arbitrarily the\ncontent or weight. By clearly delineating the destructive effects on a\nnation’s economy of a debasement of the currency, he influenced Charles\nV’s monetary and tax policies. \n\nOresme also stated that in a society in which two currencies with\nthe same designation but of different value circulate, the money of\nlower value drives out the money of higher value. This economic law was\nalso discovered independently of Oresme by Nicolaus Copernicus\n(1473–1543), the famous astronomer, who wrote about a reform of the\nPrussian coinage, and by Thomas Gresham (1519–1597). Today it is called\nGresham’s Law, or sometimes the Law of Oresme, Copernicus, and Gresham,\nbut its oldest version can be found in Aristophanes’s poem ‘The\nFrogs’ (Balch 1908).","contact.mail":"stefan.kirschner@uni-hamburg.de","contact.domain":"uni-hamburg.de"}]
