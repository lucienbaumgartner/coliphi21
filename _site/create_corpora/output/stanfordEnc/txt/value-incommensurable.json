The possibility of value incommensurability is thought\nto raise deep questions about practical reason and rational choice as\nwell as related questions concerning topics as diverse as\nakrasia, moral dilemmas, the plausibility of utilitarianism,\nand the foundations of liberalism. This entry outlines answers in the\ncontemporary literature to these questions, starting with questions\nabout the nature and possibility of value incommensurability.\n\nIncommensurability between values must be distinguished from the kind\nof incommensurability associated with Paul Feyerabend (1978, 1981,\n1993) and Thomas Kuhn (1977, 1983, 1996) in epistemology and the\nphilosophy of science. Feyerabend and Kuhn were concerned with\nincommensurability between rival theories or paradigms — that\nis, the inability to express or comprehend one conceptual scheme, such\nas Aristotelian physics, in terms of another, such as Newtonian\nphysics. \nIn contrast, contemporary inquiry into value incommensurability\nconcerns comparisons among abstract values (such as liberty or\nequality) or particular bearers of value (such as a certain\ninstitution or its effects on liberty or equality). The term\n“bearer of value” is to be understood broadly. Bearers of\nvalue can be objects of potential choice (such as a career) or states\nof affairs that cannot be chosen (such as a beautiful sunset). Such\nbearers of value are valuable in virtue of the abstract value or\nvalues they instantiate or display (so, for example, an institution\nmight be valuable in virtue of the liberty or equality that it\nengenders or embodies). \nThe term “incommensurable” suggests the lack of a common\nmeasure. This idea has its historical roots in mathematics. For the\nancient Greeks, who had not recognized irrational numbers, the\ndimensions of certain mathematical objects were found to lack a common\nunit of measurement. Consider the side and the diagonal of a square.\nThese can be compared or ranked ordinally, since the diagonal is\nlonger. However, without the use of irrational numbers, there is no\nway to specify with cardinal numbers exactly how much longer the\ndiagonal is than the side of a square. The significance of this kind\nof incommensurability, especially for the Pythagoreans, is a matter of\nsome debate (Burkert 1972, 455-465). Hippasus of Metapontum, who was\nthought by many to have demonstrated this kind of incommensurability,\nis held by legend to have been drowned by the gods for revealing his\ndiscovery (Heath 1921, 154; von Fritz 1970, 407). \nGiven these historical roots, some authors reserve the term\n“incommensurable” for comparisons that can be made, but\nnot cardinally (Stocker 1980, 176; Stocker 1997, 203) or not precisely\n(Chang 1997b, 2). Others interpret the idea of a common measure more\nbroadly. On this broader interpretation, for there to be a common\nmeasure, all that is required is that ordinal comparisons or rankings\nare possible. Values are then incommensurable only when not even an\nordinal comparison or ranking is possible. Unless stated otherwise,\nthis entry adopts this latter interpretation. \nBecause the idea of comparison is closely tied to the topic of value\nincommensurability, this has led to use of the term\n“incomparable” alongside “incommensurable” in\nthe literature.  Some authors use the terms interchangeably\n(e.g., Raz 1986). Others use them to refer to distinct concepts (e.g.,\nChang 1997b).  This entry distinguishes between the two concepts\nin the following manner. \nJoseph Raz defines two bearers of value as incommensurable if it is\nfalse that of the two “either one is better than the other or\nthey are of equal value” (1986, 342). Raz offers an example in\nwhich a person faces the choice between two equally successful\ncareers: one as a lawyer and one as a clarinetist. Neither career\nseems better than the other, and they also do not appear to be equally\ngood. If they were of equal value, then a slightly improved version of\nthe legal career would be better than the musical career, but this\njudgment appears incorrect. The legal career and the musical career,\naccording to Raz, are incommensurable. \nRuth Chang has proposed use of the term “incomparable” to\ndescribe the legal career and the musical career (1997b, 4). Two\nbearers of value are held to be incomparable if no positive\ncomparative judgment of their value is true. Positive comparative\njudgments of value specify the way in which two items compare (e.g.,\n“better than”) rather than the way in which two items do\nnot compare (e.g., “not better than”) in virtue of some\nvalue. \nDrawing on Chang’s proposal, this entry uses the term\n“incomparable” ordinarily to describe two or more concrete\nbearers of value of which no positive comparative evaluative judgment\nis true. In contrast, this entry uses the term\n“incommensurable” to describe the way in which two or more\nabstract values stand in relation to one another. Subsection 3.1\nconsiders in greater detail the relationship between the\nincomparability of bearers of value and the incommensurability of\nvalues. The remainder of section 1 considers ways in which to conceive\nof incommensurable values. \nThis section outlines three conceptions of value incommensurability,\neach one capturing some sense in which incommensurable values lack a\ncommon measure. \nThe first conception characterizes value incommensurability in terms\nof restrictions on how the further realization of one value outranks\nrealization of another value. James Griffin has proposed forms of\nvalue incommensurability of this sort. One form involves what he calls\n“trumping.” In a conflict between values A and\nB, A is said to trump B if\n“any amount of A, no matter how small, is more\nvaluable than any amount of B, no matter how\nlarge” (Griffin 1986, 83). A weaker form of value\nincommensurability involves what Griffin calls\n“discontinuity.” Two values, A and B,\nare incommensurable in this sense if “so long as we have enough\nof B any amount of A outranks any further amount of\nB; or that enough of A outranks any amount of\nB” (Griffin 1986, 85). \nIf values are incommensurable in this first sense, there is no\nambiguity whether the realization of one value outranks realization of\nthe other. Ambiguity as to whether the realization of one value\noutranks realization of the other, however, is thought by many\ntheorists to be a central feature of incommensurable values. The\nsecond and third conceptions of value incommensurability aim to\ncapture this feature. \nAccording to the second conception, values are incommensurable if and\nonly if there is no true general overall ranking of the realization of\none value against the realization of the other value. David Wiggins,\nfor example, puts this forward as one conception of value\nincommensurability. He writes that two values are incommensurable if\n“there is no general way in which A and B trade off in the whole\nrange of situations of choice and comparison in which they\nfigure” (1997, 59). \nThis second conception of value incommensurability denies what Henry\nRichardson calls “strong commensurability” (1994,\n104-105). Strong commensurability is the thesis that there is a true\nranking of the realization of one value against the realization of the\nother value in terms of one common value across all conflicts of\nvalue. A denial of such a singular common value, however, does not\nrule out what Richardson calls “weak commensurability”\n(1994, 105). Weak commensurability is the thesis that in any given\nconflict of values, there is a true ranking of the realization of one\nvalue against the realization of the other value in terms of some\nvalue. This value may be one of the values in question or some\nindependent value. This value also may differ across value conflicts.\nThe denial of strong commensurability does not entail a denial of weak\ncommensurability. Even if there is no systematic or general way to\nresolve any given conflict of values, there may be some value in\nvirtue of which the realization of one value ranks against realization\nof the other. Donald Regan defends the thesis of strong\ncommensurability (Regan 1997). Depending on how the relationship\nbetween value incommensurability and incomparability is construed\n(subsection 3.1), Ruth Chang could be considered a defender of weak\ncommensurability. She argues that “nameless values”\ncombine values in a way that allows for the comparability of\nalternatives in virtue of these nameless values (Chang 2004). \nThe third conception of value incommensurability denies both strong\nand weak commensurability (Richardson 1994, Wiggins 1997, Williams\n1981). This conception claims that in some conflicts of values, there\nis no true ranking of values. \nThis third conception of value incommensurability is sometimes said to\nbe necessary to explain why, in conflicts of value, a gain in one\nvalue does not always cancel the loss in another value. This view\nassumes that, whenever there is a true ranking between the realization\nof one value and the realization of another value, the gain in one of\nthe values cancels the loss in the other. Many commentators question\nthat assumption. This entry leaves open the possibility that when\nthere is a true ranking between the realization of one value and the\nrealization of another value, the gain in one of the two values need\nnot cancel the loss in the other. \nIf we accept this possibility, a number of questions arise. One\nquestion is what a ranking of realizations of values means if a gain\nin one value does not cancel the loss in the other. A second question\nis whether the first and second conceptions of value\nincommensurability each admit of two versions: one version in which\nthe gain in one value cancels the loss of the other and one version in\nwhich it does not. A third question concerns the relation between\nvalue incommensurability and tragedy. It may be thought that what\nmakes a choice tragic is that, no matter which alternative is chosen,\nthe gain in value cannot cancel the loss in the other value. Not all\nauthors, however, regard all value conflicts involving incommensurable\nvalues as tragic (Richardson 1994, 117). Wiggins, for example,\nreserves the second conception of value incommensurability for what he\ncalls “common or garden variety incommensurable” choices\nand the third conception for what he calls “circumstantially cum\ntragically incommensurable” choices (1997, 64). \nRather than focus on commensurability between abstract values, a\nnumber of authors focus on the comparability between concrete bearers\nof value, often in the context of choice (Broome 1997, 2000; Chang\n1997, 2002; Griffin 1986; Raz 1986). Bearers of value sometimes appear\nincomparable in cases like Joseph Raz’s example of the choice\nbetween careers (described above in subsection 1.2). \nThe case for incomparability in such examples relies in part on what\nRuth Chang calls the “Small Improvement Argument” (Chang\n2002b, 667). As noted in the initial discussion of the example, if the\nlegal and musical careers were of equal value, then a slightly\nimproved version of the legal career would be better than the musical\ncareer, but this judgment appears incorrect. The Small Improvement\nArgument takes the following general form: “if (1) A is\nneither better nor worse than B (with respect to V),\n(2) A+ is better than A (with respect to\nV), (3) A+ is not better than B (with\nrespect to V), then (4) A and B are not\nrelated by any of the standard trichotomy of relations (relativized to\nV)” where V represents the relevant set of\nconsiderations for purposes of the comparison (Chang 2002b, 667-668).\nIn addition to Raz, Ronald de Sousa and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong are\namong those who have advanced the Small Improvement Argument (De Sousa\n1974; Sinnott-Armstrong 1985). \nFocusing on the incomparability of bearers of value has given rise to\ntwo lines of inquiry in the literature. The first concerns the\nrelation between incomparability and vagueness. The second concerns\nthe range of comparative relations that can hold between two items.\nThis section summarizes debate within each line of inquiry. The\nrelation between incomparability of bearers of value and\nincommensurability of values will be addressed in subsection 3.1. \nRaz distinguishes incomparability from what he calls the\n“indeterminacy” of value. Recall that Raz defines two\nbearers of value as incomparable if and only if it is not true that\n“either one is better than the other or they are of equal\nvalue.” The indeterminacy of value is a case of vagueness: it is\nneither true nor false of two items that “either one is better\nthan the other or they are of equal value.” Raz regards the\nindeterminacy of value to result from the “general indeterminacy\nof language” (1986, 324). \nIn contrast, other philosophers argue for interpreting incomparability\nas vagueness (Griffin 1986, 96; Broome 1997, 2000). For example,\nBroome introduces what he calls a “standard configuration”\n(1997, 96; 2000, 23). Imagine the musical and legal careers from\nRaz’s example. Fix the musical career as the\n“standard.” Now imagine variations in the legal career\narranged in a line such that in one direction, the variations are\nincreasingly better than the standard and in the other direction, the\nstandard is increasingly better than the variations. There is an\nintermediate zone of legal careers that are not better than the\nstandard and such that the standard is not better than the legal\ncareers. If this zone contains one item, Broome defines this legal\ncareer to be equally good with the standard. If this zone contains\nmore than one item, the zone is either one of “hard\nindeterminacy” or one of “soft indeterminacy.” A\nzone cannot be both one of hard indeterminacy and one of soft\nindeterminacy. In a zone of hard indeterminacy, it is false that the\nlegal careers are better than the standard and false that the standard\nis better than the legal careers (1997, 73, 76). In a zone of soft\nindeterminacy, it is neither true nor false that the legal careers are\nbetter than the standard and neither true nor false that the standard\nis better than the legal careers (1997, 76). The latter is a zone of\nvagueness. Broome argues that indeterminate comparatives, including\n“better than” are softly indeterminate, thereby arguing\nfor interpreting incomparability in terms of vagueness. \nBy understanding incomparability to entail vagueness, Broome disagrees\nwith Raz (Broome 2000, 30). Raz defines incomparability so that it is\ncompatible with vagueness, but not so that it entails vagueness.\nGriffin also argues that incomparability entails vagueness (1986, 96).\nWhere Broome disagrees with Griffin is with regard to the width and\nsignificance of the zone of soft indeterminacy. Broome takes Griffin\nto suggest that if there is a zone of soft indeterminacy, it is narrow\nand unimportant. Broome argues that vagueness need not imply either\nnarrowness or lack of importance (2000, 30-31). Erik Carlson (2004)\nprovides one response to Broome’s account. \nThe second line of inquiry concerns the set of possible comparative\nrelations that can obtain between two items. The small improvement\nargument for the incomparability of the musical career and the legal\ncareer in Raz’s example assumes what Chang calls the\n“trichotomy thesis.” The trichotomy thesis holds that if\ntwo items can be compared in terms of some value or set of values,\nthen the two items are related by one of the standard trichotomy of\ncomparative relations, “better than,” “worse\nthan,” or “equally good” (2002b, 660). A number of\nauthors have argued that these three comparative relations do not\nexhaust the space of comparative relations. If they are correct, the\nmusical career and the legal career may, in fact, be comparable. \nJames Griffin and Derek Parfit argue that items may in fact be\n“roughly equal” and hence comparable (Griffin 1986, 80-81,\n96-98, and 104; 1997, 38-39; 2000, 285-289; Parfit 1987, 431). As an\nillustration, Parfit imagines comparing two poets and a novelist for a\nliterary prize (1987, 431). Neither the First Poet nor the Novelist is\nworse than the other and the Second Poet is slightly better than the\nFirst Poet. If the First Poet and the Novelist were equally good, it\nwould follow that the Second Poet is better than the Novelist. This\njudgment, according to Parfit, need not follow. Instead, the First\nPoet and the Novelist may be roughly equal. The intuition is that even\nthough three items display the respects in virtue of which the\ncomparisons are made, some comparisons are inherently rough so that\neven though two alternatives are not worse than one other, they are\nnot equally good. In turn, the musical and legal careers in\nRaz’s example may be roughly equal. \n“Roughly equal,” as used here, is to be distinguished from\ntwo other ways in which the term has been used: (1) to refer to a\nsmall difference in value between two items and (2) to refer to a\nchoice of little significance (Raz 1986, 333). As used here, two items\nA and B are said to be roughly equal if neither is worse than the\nother and C’s being better than B does not imply that C is\nbetter than A when the comparisons are all in virtue of the same set\nof respects. \nThere is some debate as to whether “roughly equal” is in\nfact a fourth comparative relation to be considered in addition to the\nthree standard relations, “better than,” “worse\nthan,” and “equally good.” One way to conceive of\n“roughly equal” is as a “roughed up” version\nof “equally good.” On this interpretation, the trichotomy\nthesis basically holds; there are simply precise and rough versions\n(Chang 2002b, 661, fn. 5). Furthermore, “roughly equal” is\na relation that can be defined only in virtue of three items, and as\nsuch, appears to be something distinct from a standard comparative\nrelation. The standard comparative relations are binary; transitivity\nwith respect to them is a separate condition (Hsieh 2005, 195). \nA separate proposal for a genuine fourth relationship is Ruth\nChang’s argument for “on a par” (Chang 1997; Chang\n2002b). Two items are said to be on a par if neither is better than\nthe other, their differences preclude their being equally good, and\nyet they are comparable. Whereas “roughly equal” is\ninvoked to allow for comparability among alternatives that display the\nsame respects (e.g., literary merit), “on a par” is\ninvoked to allow for comparability between alternatives that are\ndifferent in the respects that they display. Imagine comparing Mozart\nand Michelangelo in terms of creativity. According to Chang, neither\nMozart nor Michelangelo is less creative than the other. Because the\ntwo artists display creativity in such different fields, however, it\nwould be mistaken to judge them to be equally creative. Nevertheless,\naccording to Chang, they are comparable with respect to creativity.\nSomething can be said about their relative merits with respect to the\nsame consideration. According to Chang, they are on a par. \nChang’s argument relies on invoking a continuum that resembles\nBroome’s standard configuration. Chang asks us to imagine a\nsequence of sculptors who are successively worse than Michelangelo\nuntil we arrive at a sculptor who is clearly worse than Mozart in\nterms of creativity. Chang then brings to bear the intuition that\n“between two evaluatively very different items, a small\nunidimensional difference cannot trigger incomparability where before\nthere was comparability” (2002b, 673). In the light of this\nintuition, because Mozart is comparable to this bad sculptor, Mozart\nis also comparable to each of the sculptors in the sequence, including\nMichelangelo. \nWhether “roughly equal” or “on a par” imply\ncomparability is a matter of some debate. “Roughly equal”\nand “on a par,” for example, are intransitive, so to\nrecognize them as distinct comparative relations would require us to\nreconsider the transitivity of comparative relations (Hsieh 2007).\nSome authors suggest that one of the three standard comparative\nrelations obtains between all items that are claimed to be\nincomparable, roughly equal, or on a par (Regan 1997). In the case of\n“on a par,” Joshua Gert has argued that it can be defined\nin terms of the three standard comparative relations (2004). Another\nview is that values can be “clumpy,” meaning that the\nvalues sort items into clumps. According to this view, once we\nrecognize the way in which the relation “equally good”\nfunctions in the context of clumpy values, items that appear to\nrequire “roughly equal” or “on a par” can be\njudged equally good (Hsieh 2005). \nAfter determining what incommensurability and incomparability are, the\nnext step is to assess the arguments for and against these\npossibilities. That is the task of this section. \nThe most direct argument against the possibility that values are\nincommensurable is based on value monism (e.g., Mill 1979 and Sidgwick\n1981). Donald Regan, for example, argues that “given any two\nitems (objects, experiences, states of affairs, whatever) sufficiently\nwell specified so that it is apposite to inquire into their\n(intrinsic) value in the Moorean sense, then either one is better than\nthe other, or the two are precisely equal in value” (Regan 1997,\n129). \nThis argument has been questioned. Ruth Chang, for example, points\nout, with reference to John Stuart Mill, that values may have both\nqualitative and quantitative aspects such that a single value may have\nqualitative dimensions that give rise to incomparability (Chang 1997b,\n16-17). \nFor purposes of this entry, it will not be assumed that value monism\nrules out incomparability of bearers of value. The additional\nassumption required for value monism to rule out incomparability is\nthat the single value serves as a complete common measure for\ncomparing any two bearers of value. A common measure is complete if\nand only if for any two alternatives that display the respects that\ncomprise the common measure, it is true that some positive value\njudgment holds true in virtue of that list of respects. \nIn any case, many philosophers argue for some form of value pluralism\n(Berlin 1969, Finnis 1981, Nagel 1979, Raz 1986, Stocker 1990, Taylor\n1982, Williams 1981). Although this entry will not assume value\npluralism, most philosophers who argue for incommensurability or\nincomparability are value pluralists, so it will be simpler to present\ntheir views by talking of separate values. \nIn the choice between the musical and legal careers in Raz’s\nexample, each career appears to be favored by different\nconsiderations. In the case of the musical career, such considerations\nmay include those of aesthetic value, whereas in the case of the legal\ncareer, such considerations may include the value in serving\none’s fellow citizens. If these values were commensurable, it\nseems that the careers would be comparable. In this manner, the\nincomparability of bearers of value has been taken to support the\npossibility that values are incommensurable. \nThree sorts of objections have been raised against this line of\nreasoning. First, as noted in subsection 2.2, some authors object on\nepistemic grounds to the case for incomparability (e.g., Regan 1997).\nThese authors point out that the evaluative judgments involved in\nproposed examples of incomparability are complex, involving multiple\nconsiderations. In turn, we may be mistaken when we make the judgment\nof two items that neither is better than the other nor are they\nequally good. Instead, it may be that one of the three standard\ncomparative relations obtains between the items in question. \nThe second objection begins with the claim that one can always specify\na set of relevant considerations in virtue of which a comparison can\nbe made. Chang, for example, writes “in choosing between two\ncareers, various considerations are relevant … if, indeed,\nthere is no further single consideration that combines those\nconsiderations, we can simply stipulate one, for example,\n‘goodness of career,’ which is nothing more than a list of\nthe various relevant considerations” (2002b, 667). In turn, if\nwe acknowledge the possibility that items thought incomparable are, in\nfact, comparable by way of “roughly equal” or “on a\npar,” then it would appear that “goodness of career”\nserves as a common measure against which to compare the musical and\nlegal careers in Raz’s example. There is no lack of a common\nmeasure. \nOne response to this objection is to distinguish between the way in\nwhich people rank bearers of value when they judge them to be\n“roughly equal” or “on a par” and the way in\nwhich people rank bearers of value when they judge them to be\n“equally good.” In the case of equally good items, the\nchoice of either is justified because the gain involved in choosing\none item is supposed to fully cancel the loss in not choosing the\nother item. In the case of “roughly equal” or “on a\npar,” however, it is not clear that this must be the case. Items\nthat are “roughly equal” or “on a par” are\nvaluable in virtue of different respects; the value realized in\nchoosing one item may not cancel the loss in not choosing the other.\nBearers of value may be “roughly equal” or “on a\npar” with respect to some set of values even though the values\ndisplay a central feature of incommensurable values—namely, that\nthe gain in one value does not cancel the loss in another. \nThe question then arises whether bearers of value can be comparable\neven though the values they bear are incommensurable. If so, it may be\nsaid that what distinguishes a list of respects, such as\n“goodness of career,” from a common measure is that it is\nonly in the case of a common measure that the gain in one value\ncancels the loss in another. In a comparison with regard to a list of\nrespects, it may be said, the gain in one respect need not cancel the\nloss in another respect. \nThe third objection points out that even if we do not accept the\ncomparability of the musical and legal careers in Raz’s example,\nsome versions of the musical career and legal career appear\ncomparable. In John Broome’s account discussed in subsection\n2.1, the initial musical career is comparable with particularly bad\nlegal careers. The comparison between the initial musical career and a\nbad legal career is an example of what Chang refers to as a\n“nominal-notable comparison”—a comparison between a\nfine exemplar of a value and a poor exemplar of a value (1997b, 14).\nGiven that the comparisons involve the same set of considerations,\ndoes the ability to rank some careers suggest that the values involved\nin the initial comparison are in fact commensurable so there is, in\nfact, a common measure? \nThis question arises in part because the way in which the musical\ncareer is judged better than the bad legal career does not appear to\nbe a case of dominance. In a case of dominance, one alternative is\nbetter than another with respect to at least one of the values against\nwhich the comparison is made and worse with respect to none. Insofar\nas dominance is not thought to rely on there being a common measure,\nranking by way of dominance need not rule out the incommensurability\nof values. The judgment that the musical career is better than the bad\nlegal career, however, does not appear to be a case of dominance. The\nmusical career may be judged better than the bad legal career even\nthough the bad legal career is better than the musical career in some\nrespects. For example, the bad legal career may be better than the\nmusical career with respect to the value of protecting the legal\nrights of fellow citizens. This suggests that the judgment is in\nvirtue of a common measure. Regan, for example, uses an argument along\nthese lines to challenge the possibility that values are\nincommensurable (1997, 135). \nOne response to this third objection is that comparability in the case\nof nominal-notable comparisons need not rule out the\nincommensurability of values. As noted at the outset of this section,\nthe incomparability of bearers of value is taken to suggest that the\nvalues they bear are incommensurable. As long as there are some cases\nin which bearers of value are incomparable, even if bearers of value\nare comparable in the case of nominal-notable comparisons, the\nconditions for value incommensurability are satisfied. \nIt may be objected that just because some careers are incomparable\nwith respect to “goodness as a career” in Raz’s\nexample, we should not rule out “goodness as a career” as\na common measure. According to this view, it is a mistake to assume\nthat for a list of respects (e.g., “goodness of career”)\nto serve as a common measure, it must be\n“complete”—meaning that for any two alternatives\nthat display those respects, it is true that some positive value\njudgment holds true in virtue of that list of respects. \nIn response, it is not clear what is gained for the analysis of value\nincommensurability by calling “goodness as a career” a\ncommon measure. First, calling “goodness as a career” a\ncommon measure for comparing the legal and musical careers would\nchange neither the judgment that one career is not better than the\nother nor the judgment that they are not equally good. The general\nphenomenon remains the same. Second, lack of completeness can arise\nfor a number of different reasons. The concept of value\nincommensurability aims to capture what underlies the lack of\ncompleteness in comparisons between alternatives such as the legal and\nmusical careers. Also, there might be other ways to capture the lack\nof completeness. \nA second argument for incommensurable values is grounded in the idea\nthat value incommensurability is constitutive of certain goods and\nvalues. In keeping with the usage in this entry, in some instances,\n“constitutive incomparability” is perhaps a more\nappropriate term than “constitutive incommensurability.”\nThe reason for this is that the case for constitutive\nincommensurability of values often relies on the apparent\nincomparability of specific bearers of value. Two versions of this\nsecond argument will be discussed here. \nOne version of this argument comes from Joseph Raz. Consider being\noffered a significant amount of money to leave one’s spouse for\na month. The indignation that is typically experienced in response to\nsuch an offer, according to Raz, is grounded in part in the symbolic\nsignificance of certain actions (1986, 349). In this case, “what\nhas symbolic significance is the very judgment that companionship is\nincommensurable with money” (1986, 350). Although this form of\nvalue incommensurability looks like trumping, Raz does not see this as\na case of trumping. He rejects the view that companionship is more\nvaluable than money. If such a view were correct, then those who forgo\ncompanionship for money would be acting against reason (1986, 352).\nInstead, Raz takes the view that a “belief in incommensurability\nis itself a qualification for having certain relations” (1986,\n351). Someone who does not regard companionship and money as\nincommensurable simply has chosen a kind of life that may be\nfulfilling in many ways, but being capable of having companionship is\nnot one of them. \nIn Raz’s account, the symbolic significance of judging money to\nbe incommensurable with companionship involves the existence of a\nsocial convention that determines participation in that convention\n(e.g., marriage) that requires a belief in value incommensurability.\nThis conventional nature of belief in value incommensurability in\nRaz’s account raises a question for some authors about its\nrobustness as an account of value incommensurability. For example,\nChang objects that incommensurability appears to become relative to\none’s participation in social conventions (2001, 48). It remains\nan open question how much of a problem this point raises. Raz’s\naccount appears to illustrate a basic sense in which the values of\nmoney and companionship can be incommensurable. Insofar as it is not\nagainst reason to choose money over companionship, there is no general\nway to resolve a conflict of values between money and companionship.\nIn Raz’s account, the resolution depends upon which social\nconvention one has chosen to pursue. \nElizabeth Anderson advances a second argument for constitutive\nincommensurability. Her account is grounded in a pragmatic account of\nvalue. Anderson reduces “‘x is good’ roughly to\n‘it is rational to value x,’ where to value something is\nto adopt toward it a favorable attitude susceptible to rational\nreflection” (1997, 95). She argues that in virtue of these\nattitudes there may be no good reason to compare the overall values of\ntwo goods. Pragmatism holds that if such a comparison serves no\npractical function, then the comparative value judgment has no truth\nvalue, meaning that the goods are incommensurable (1997, 99). Because\nthe favorable attitudes one adopts toward goods help to make them\ngood, Anderson’s account can be seen as an argument for\nconstitutive incommensurability (Chang 2001, 49). \nAnderson advances three ways in which there may be no good reason to\ncompare the overall values of goods. First, it may be boring or\npointless to engage in comparison. To illustrate, “the project\nof comprehensively ranking all works of art in terms of their\nintrinsic aesthetic value is foolish, boring, and stultifying”\n(1997, 100). Second, Anderson points to instances in which “it\nmakes sense to leave room for the free play of nonrational motivations\nlike whims and moods” as in the choice of what to do on a\nleisurely Sunday afternoon (1997, 91). Third, Anderson argues that the\nroles that goods play in deliberation can be so different that\n“attempts to compare them head to head are incoherent”\n(1997, 91). Imagine that the only way to save one’s dying mother\nis to give up a friendship. Rather than compare their overall values,\nargues Anderson, ordinary moral thinking focuses on what one owes to\none’s mother and one’s friends (1997, 102). This focus on\nobligation recognizes mother and friend each to be intrinsically\nvaluable and yet valuable in different ways (1997, 103). There is no\ngood reason, according to Anderson, to compare their overall values\nwith regard to some common measure. \nChang argues against each of the three points raised by Anderson\n(Chang 2001). In response to the first point, Chang notes there are\noccasions in which comparisons do need to be made between goods for\nwhich Anderson argues there is no good reason to make comparisons. In\nresponse to the second point, Chang argues that the range of instances\nfor which the second argument applies is small. In response to the\nthird point, Chang contends that Anderson’s argument assumes\nthat if goods are comparable then they have some value or evaluative\nproperty in common. Chang points out that this need not be the case.\nAs discussed above in subsection 3.1, the comparability of goods need\nnot entail value commensurability. \nValue incommensurability has also been invoked to make sense of a\ncentral feature of supposed moral dilemmas—namely, that no\nmatter which alternative the agent chooses, she fails to do something\nshe ought to do. Although moral dilemmas involve choices between\nconcrete bearers of value, the apparent value conflicts involved in\nthese choices have led some philosophers to relate moral dilemmas to\nthe incommensurability of values. Henry Richardson, for example, takes\nthe situation confronting Sophie in the novel Sophie’s\nChoice—that one of her two children will be spared death,\nbut only if she chooses which one to save—to point to the\nincommensurability of values (1994, 115-117). \nIt has been argued that the mere fact of a moral dilemma does not\nimply value incommensurability. James Griffin, for example, argues\nthat the feature of “irreplaceability” in moral dilemmas\noften may be mistaken as evidence for value incommensurability (1997,\n37). Irreplaceability is the feature that what is lost in choosing one\nalternative over another cannot be replaced by what is gained in\nchoosing another alternative. Although a conflict of incommensurable\nvalues displays this feature, not all instances of irreplaceability\nneed involve plural values. Some moral dilemmas, for example, may\ninvolve not a conflict of values, but a conflict of obligations that\narises from the same consideration. Consider forced choices in saving\nlives. If there is a dilemma, it need not involve conflicting values,\nbut rather conflicting obligations that arise from the same\nconsideration. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong calls such dilemmas\n“symmetrical” (1988, 54-58). The dilemma encountering\nSophie, it may be said, does not point to the incommensurability of\nvalues. \nRichardson acknowledges that the moral considerations underlying\nSophie’s dilemma are not incommensurable. Nonetheless, he takes\nvalue incommensurability to be essential to understanding the tragedy\nof the dilemma that Sophie encounters. “It is a distinguishing\nfeature of love, including parental love,” he writes,\n“that it cherishes the particular and unique features of the\nbeloved” (115). He concludes, “the fact that she cannot\nadequately represent each child’s value on a single scale is\nwhat makes the choosing tragic” (116). By locating the\nincommensurability of values at the level of what is valuable about\neach of her children, Richardson argues that the tragedy of the\ndilemma points to value incommensurability. \nAnother common approach to argue for value incommensurability is with\nreference to “non-symmetrical” dilemmas. As the name\nsuggests, in non-symmetrical dilemmas, the alternatives are favored by\ndifferent values (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988). If these values are\nincommensurable in the third sense as discussed in subsection 1.3,\nthere is no systematic resolution of the value conflict. Consider\nJean-Paul Sartre’s well-known example of his pupil who faced the\nchoice between going to England to join the Free French Forces and\nstaying at home to help his mother live (Sartre 1975, 295-296). No\nmatter which alternative he chooses, certain values will remain\nunrealized. An idea along these lines is considered, for example, by\nWalter Sinnott-Armstrong (1988, 69-71) and Bernard Williams (1981,\n74-78) in their discussions of moral dilemmas. \nValue incommensurability also features in debates about\nakrasia (Nussbaum 2001, 113-117). David Wiggins, for example,\ninvokes the idea of value incommensurability to suggest “the\nheterogeneity of the psychic sources of desire satisfaction and of\nevaluation” (1998, 266). This heterogeneity, according to\nWiggins, allows for a coherent account of the agent’s attraction\nto what is not best. It allows for a divergence between desire and\nvalue such that the akratic individual can be attracted to a value\nthat should not be sought at that point in time. Wiggins invokes value\nincommensurability to capture the idea that a gain in the value that\nshould not be sought does not reduce the loss in choosing what is not\nbest. \nIn contrast, Michael Stocker denies that value incommensurability is\nrequired for a coherent account of akrasia (1990, 214-240).\nFor Stocker, coherent akrasia is possible with a single value\nin just the way that it is possible to be attracted to two objects\nthat differ with respect to the same value (e.g., “a languorous\nlesser pleasure and a piquant better pleasure” (1990, 230)).\nRecall the discussion of quantitative and qualitative aspects of a\nsingle value at the outset of section 3. \nAs suggested by the discussion of moral dilemmas and akrasia,\nmuch of the inquiry into value incommensurability is motivated more\ngenerally by theories of practical reason and rational choice. Some\nauthors have argued that the possibility of value incommensurability\nraises problems for the possibility of justified choice in conflicts\nbetween incommensurable values. Even if a conception of justified\nchoice can accommodate value incommensurability, questions remain\nabout how to justify choice on the basis of incommensurable values and\nhow to reason about incommensurable values. This section considers\nthese issues as they have been discussed in the contemporary\nphilosophical literature. \nIt is worth noting the potential for drawing connections between the\nphilosophical literature and the literature in psychology and the\nsocial sciences on decision-making. One area for such potential is the\npsychological literature on the difficulty of making decisions (Yates,\nVeinott, and Patalano 2003). Jane Beattie and Sema Barlas (2001), for\nexample, advance the thesis that the observed variation in the\ndifficulty of making trade-offs between alternatives can be explained\nin part by the category to which the alternatives belong. The authors\nconsider three categories: commodities (“objects that are\nappropriately bought and sold in markets”), currencies\n(“objects that act as stand-ins for commodities”), and\nnoncommodities (“objects that either cannot be transferred\n(e.g., pain) or that lose some of their value by being traded in\nmarkets (e.g., friendship)”) (Beattie and Barlas 2001, 30). The\nauthors’ experimental findings are consistent with participants\nholding normative commitments about exchanging currencies and\nnoncommodities similar to those considered in the discussion of\nconstitutive incommensurability in subsection 3.2. For example,\nBeattie and Barlas report that participants “had a significant\ntendency to choose noncommodities over commodities and\ncurrencies” and that choices between noncommodities and\ncurrencies were the easiest for participants (2001, 50-51). The\nauthors interpret these results to support the view that people choose\nnoncommodities over currencies on the basis of a rule without engaging\nin a calculation of trade-offs (2001, 51-53). \nAt a minimum, for the choice of an alternative to qualify as\njustified, there must not be an overriding reason against choosing it.\nBeyond that, conceptions of justified choice differ in what is\nrequired for the choice of an alternative to qualify as justified. \nRuth Chang defines “comparativism” as the view that\n“a comparative fact about the alternatives determines which\nalternative one is justified in choosing” (1998, 1572). A common\nform of comparativism is “optimization.” According to\noptimization, the fact that an alternative is at least as good as each\nother alternative is what justifies its choice. If one accepts the\ntrichotomy thesis (subsection 2.2), an alternative is at least as good\nas another if and only if it is equally good or better than it. If one\naccepts the possibility of “on a par” as a genuine fourth\nrelation (subsection 2.2), then an alternative that is at least as\ngood as another is also on a par with it. Optimization is most\nfrequently associated with an economic conception of rational choice\nand decision theory. Chang associates optimization even more widely\nwith “most forms of consequentialism, some versions of virtue\ntheory, and, arguably, certain forms of deontology” (1998,\n1577-1578). If value incommensurability gives rise to the\nincomparability of alternatives as discussed in subsection 3.1, then\nvalue incommensurability precludes the possibility of justified choice\nunder optimization. \nOne response has been to argue that apparently incomparable\nalternatives are, in fact, comparable. As discussed in subsection 2.2,\njudgments of incomparability frequently involve comparisons that are\ndifficult and it may be that judgments of incomparability are mistaken\n(Regan 1997). In addition, as discussed, alternatives that appear\nincomparable by way of “better than,” “worse\nthan,” or “equally good” may be comparable by way of\nsome fourth comparative relation, such as “roughly equal”\nor “on a par.” It also has been argued that\n“nameless values” combine values in a way that allows for\ncomparability of alternatives in virtue of these nameless values\n(Chang 2004). \nAnother line of response, one from within the economics literature,\nhas been to distinguish between “optimization” and\n“maximization” as theories of justified choice (Sen 1997,\n746; Sen 2000, 486). According to the theory of optimization as\njustified choice, the choice of an alternative is justified only if\nthe alternative is at least as good as each other alternative. In\ncontrast, the theory of maximization as justified choice only requires\nthe choice of an alternative that is not worse than other\nalternatives. Because incomparable alternatives are not worse than one\nanother, the choice of either is justified according to the theory of\nmaximization as justified choice. If proponents of comparativism have\nno reason to reject maximization as an account of justified choice, as\nhas been argued (Hsieh 2007), then incomparability, and value\nincommensurability, need not pose a problem for the possibility of\njustified choice. \nOne objection voiced against accounts that permit justified choice\nbetween alternatives that are roughly equal or on a par or between\nincomparable alternatives is that such accounts may justify a series\nof choices that leaves a person worse off. Consider Raz’s\nexample of career choice. Suppose the person chooses the musical\ncareer over the legal career. At a future time, she has the\nopportunity to pursue a legal career that is slightly worse than the\ninitial legal career. Suppose this slightly worse legal career and the\nmusical career are judged roughly equal or on a par. If justified\nchoice permits her to choose either of two alternatives when they are\nroughly equal or on a par, then she would be justified in choosing the\nslightly worse legal career. Similarly, if justified choice does not\nrequire the comparability of alternatives, she could be justified in\nchoosing the slightly worse legal career. Through a series of such\napparently justified choices, she would be left significantly worse\noff in a manner analogous to a “money pump” (Chang 1997,\n11). \nOne response is to question whether the problem posed by choices of\nthis sort is serious. John Broome, for example, notes that after\nhaving chosen one kind of career, a person may change her mind and\nchoose the kind of career she previously rejected. According to\nBroome, there would be a puzzle only if she did not repudiate her\nprevious choice (2000, 34). \nAnother line of response is that the considerations that make some\nalternatives worthy of choice count against the constant switching\namong alternatives envisioned in this objection. First, the constant\nswitching among alternatives is akin to not choosing an alternative.\nIf the alternatives are such that choosing either is better than\nchoosing neither, then the considerations that make the alternatives\nworthy of choice count against constantly switching among them.\nSecond, to switch constantly among careers appears to misunderstand\nwhat makes the alternatives worthy of choice. Not only is pursuing a\ncareer the kind of activity that depends upon continued engagement for\nits success, but it is also the kind of activity that is unlikely to\nbe judged truly successful unless one demonstrates some commitment to\nit. Third, for a career to be considered successful, it may require\nthe chooser to adopt a favorable attitude toward the considerations\nthat favor it over other careers. In turn, when subsequently presented\nwith the choice of a legal career, the considerations favoring it may\nno longer apply to her in the same way as they did before (Hsieh\n2007). \nThe idea expressed in the distinction between optimization and\nmaximization in subsection 4.1 can be expressed more generally in\nterms of the idea of rational eligibility. To say that an alternative\nis rationally eligible is to mean that choosing it would not be an\nunjustified choice. Which alternatives are judged rationally eligible\nmay vary with the theory of justified choice. According to\nmaximization as a theory of justified choice, an alternative is\nrationally eligible if and only if there is no better alternative. \nIssac Levi (1986; 2004) argues for\n“v-admissibility” as a criterion of justified\nchoice. For v-admissibility, value incommensurability does\nnot pose a problem for the possibility of justified choice. An\nalternative is v-admissible if and only if it is optimal\naccording to at least one of the relevant considerations at hand. In\nsome conflicts of value, maximization and v-admissibility\nspecify the same alternatives as rationally eligible. Suppose that\nalternative X is better than alternative Y with\nrespect to consideration A and alternative Y is\nbetter than alternative X with respect to consideration\nB. According to maximization as a theory of justified choice,\nboth X and Y are rationally eligible; neither\nalternative is better than the other with respect to A and\nB taken together. Both alternatives are also rationally\neligible according to v-admissibility; X is optimal\nwith respect to A and Y is optimal with respect to\nB.  \nIn some conflicts of value, maximization and v-admissibility\nspecify different sets of alternatives as rationally eligible.\nV-admissibility is more restrictive than maximization (Levi\n2004). Add to the above example alternative Z. Suppose that\nX is better than Z, which is better than Y,\nall with respect to A. Suppose also that Y is better\nthan Z, which is better than X, all with respect to\nB. According to maximization as a theory of justified choice,\nX, Y, and Z are rationally eligible; no\nalternative is better than the other with respect to A and\nB taken together. However, Z is not rationally\neligible according to v-admissibility. Z is not\noptimal with respect to A. Nor is it optimal with respect to\nB. Only X and Y are rationally eligible\naccording to v-admissibility. According to Levi,\nv-admissibility captures what he takes to be a plausible\njudgment—namely, that it would be unjustified to choose the\nalternative that is second worse on all relevant respects (Levi 2004).\nThe plausibility of this judgment might be questioned. Suppose that\nZ is only slightly worse than X with respect to\nA and Z is only slightly worse than Y with\nrespect to B. Does the judgment still hold? \nFor Joseph Raz, value incommensurability also does not pose a problem\nfor the possibility of justified choice (1997). If incommensurable\nvalues give us reasons to choose both alternatives, they are both\nrationally eligible from the perspective of justified choice. As such,\nthe choice of either alternative is justified on the basis of\nreason. \nOne question that arises is this. If an agent has reason to choose\neither alternative and they are not equally good, what makes her\nchoice of one alternative over another intelligible to her? For Raz,\nwhat explains the choice of one alternative over the other is the\nexercise of the will. By the will, Raz has in mind “the ability\nto choose and perform intentional actions” and “the most\ntypical exercise or manifestation of the will is in choosing among\noptions that reason merely renders eligible” (1997, 111). \nJohn Finnis advances a similar view in response to the question of\nintelligibility. Finnis writes, “in free choice, one has reasons\nfor each of the alternative options, but these reasons are not\ncausally determinative. … No factor but the choosing itself\nsettles which alternative is chosen” (1997, 220). In a\nchoice between alternatives each favored by different, incommensurable\nvalues, even though there are reasons to choose both alternatives,\nbecause reasons are not causally determinative, the lack of a reason\nto choose one alternative over another need not render the choice\nunintelligible. \nDonald Regan challenges this view. According to Regan, unless grounded\nin an adequate reason, “a decision to go one way rather than\nanother will be something that happened to the agent rather than\nsomething she did” and hence be unintelligible to the agent\nherself (1997, 144). Suppose the agent has no more reason to choose\none alternative over another and the choice, as suggested above, is\nsettled by her wants. On Regan’s view, if the agent’s\nchoice is to be intelligible to her, her wants must be grounded in\nreasons. Because she has no more reason to choose one alternative over\nanother initially, the reasons grounding her wants must be available\nto her only after the initially relevant reasons are exhausted. This\nstrikes Regan as implausible (1997, 150). Regan concludes that no\nchoice between incommensurable values or incomparable bearers of value\nis intelligible in the ways suggested by Raz or Finnis. \nA number of authors have argued that practical reason has available to\nit the resources to accommodate value incommensurability in ways that\nwould appear to address the concern raised by Regan. \nCharles Taylor outlines two such sets of resources. First, we are able\nto appeal to “constitutive goods that lie behind the life\ngoods” our sense of which is “fleshed out, and passed on,\nin a whole range of media: stories, legends, portraits of exemplary\nfigures and their actions and passions, as well as in artistic works,\nmusic, dance, ritual, modes of worship, and so on” (1997, 179).\nSecond, we cannot escape the need to live an integrated life or to\nhave this, at a minimum, as an aspiration (1997, 180). Given that a\nlife is finite, leading a life involves an articulation of how\ndifferent goods fit into it relative to one another. More generally,\nour lives take on a certain “shape” and this shape\nprovides guidance in making choices in the face of value\nincommensurability (1997, 183). Michael Stocker similarly points out\nthat alternatives are rarely considered in the abstract (1997).\nInstead, they are usually considered in concrete ways in which they\nare valuable—for example, as part of one’s life. Once\nconsidered in such concrete contexts, there are considerations\naccording to which alternatives can be evaluated for purposes of\njustified choice. In his analysis of incommensurability, Fred\nD’Agostino discusses the role of social institutions in\nresolving value conflicts (2003). \nAnother resource that has been invoked is morality. Recall Elizabeth\nAnderson’s discussion of the example of the choice between\nsaving the life of one’s mother and maintaining a close\nfriendship. Anderson regards the attempt to invoke a comparison of\nvalues as incoherent from the perspective of practical reason.\nInstead, ordinary moral thinking focuses on the obligations one has to\none’s mother and one’s friends. In turn, Anderson suggests\nthat the obligations themselves will provide guidance (1997, 106). The\navailability of such resources to reason is independent of her\ntheories of value and rationality. John Finnis also points to\nprinciples of morality as guiding reason in a way that does not depend\nupon comparing incommensurable values (1997). It remains an open\nquestion as to how wide a range of cases it is in which morality can\nprovide such guidance. \nOne worry that may arise in appealing to such external resources is\nthat they address the problem of value incommensurability by simply\ndenying it. The shape of one’s life or the “constitutive\ngoods that lie behind the life goods,” for example, would appear\nto be sources of value. Insofar as they provide a value against which\nto resolve the initial value conflict, it might be said that there was\nno problem of value incommensurability in the first place. \nTwo responses to this worry can be given. First, even if these\nexternal resources are a source of commensurating value, it does not\nfollow that they provide a systematic resolution to value conflicts.\nInsofar as the shapes of people’s lives differ, the way in which\ntwo individuals resolve the same value conflict may be different. The\nfact that it may be consistent with reason to resolve the same value\nconflict in different ways points to the possibility of value\nincommensurability. \nSecond, in the case of moral considerations, there may not be any\ndenial of value incommensurability. Moral considerations may provide\nguidance without comparing alternative courses of action with respect\nto a common measure (Finnis 1997, 225-226). Furthermore, some\nphilosophers argue that the moral wrongness of certain actions is\nintelligible only in virtue of the incommensurability of values. For\nexample, Alan Strudler argues that to deliberate about the\npermissibility of lying in terms of commensurable values is to\nmisunderstand the wrong in lying (1998, 1561-1564). \nRecall that value incommensurability was thought to pose a problem for\njustified choice in part because it gives rise to the possibility of\nincomparability among alternatives. In this light, it would appear\nthat conceptions of justified choice that do not rely on comparisons\navoid the problems posed by value incommensurability. Stocker aims to\nprovide one such account of justified choice (1990; 1997). Two\nfeatures help to distinguish his account. First, he argues for\nevaluating alternatives as “the best” in an absolute,\nrather than a relative, sense. Optimization and maximization rely on\nchoosing “the best” in a relative sense: given the\nrelevant comparison class, there is no better alternative. To be\n“the best” in an absolute sense, an alternative\n“must be, of its kind, excellent—satisfying, or coming\nclose to, ideals and standards” (1997, 206). This is the sense,\nfor example, in which a person can be the best of friends even if we\nmay have even better friends. More generally, an alternative can be\nabsolutely best even if there are better alternatives, and even if an\nalternative is relatively best, it may not be absolutely best. The\nsecond distinctive feature of Stocker’s account is his appeal to\na good life, for example, or part of a good life or project. This\nappeal does not require the alternative to be the best for that life\nor project. Instead, the alternative need only be good enough for that\nlife or project to qualify as a justified choice. \nStocker’s account of justified choice differs from the concept\nof “satisficing” as used in the economics and rational\nchoice literature. Introduced into the economics literature by Herbert\nSimon (1955), satisficing is the process of choosing in which it is\nrational to stop seeking alternatives when the agent finds one that is\n“good enough” (Byron 2004). Where satisficing differs from\nStocker’s account is that satisficing is instrumentally rational\nin virtue of a more general maximizing account of choice. In\nsituations in which finding the best alternative is prohibitively\ncostly or impossible, for example, satisficing becomes rational. In\ncontrast, on Stocker’s account, choosing the alternative that is\n“good enough” is non-instrumentally rational (Stocker\n2004). \nObjections discussed in previous sections may be raised with respect\nto Stocker’s account. Suppose two alternatives are both good in\nan absolute sense and incommensurable. According to Stocker’s\naccount, insofar as both alternatives are good enough for an\nagent’s life, the choice of either alternative appears\njustified. As discussed in subsection 4.2, Regan and others may object\nthat the choice of either alternative is not intelligible to the\nagent. Also, the appeal to a good life may raise the worry discussed\nin subsection 4.4 that Stocker’s account addresses the problem\nof value incommensurability by simply denying it. \nThe topic of value incommensurability also arises in accounts that\nconcern deliberation about ends. This section discusses two\naccounts. \nThe first account is by Henry Richardson (1994). Richardson argues for\nthe possibility of rational deliberation about ends. According to\nRichardson, if value commensurability is a prerequisite for rational\nchoice, choices involving conflicting values could be made rationally\nif each of the values were expressed in terms of their contribution to\nfurthering some common end. This conception of choice treats this\ncommon end as the one final end relevant for the choice. According to\nRichardson, the idea that value commensurability is a prerequisite for\nrational choice seems to rule out rational deliberation about ends\n(1994, 15). \nRichardson defends an account of rational deliberation about ends that\ndoes not depend upon value commensurability. In his account, rational\ndeliberation involves achieving coherence among one’s\nends.  Briefly, coherence is “a matter of finding or\nconstructing intelligible connections or links or mutual support among\nthem and of removing relations of opposition or conflict”\n(Richardson 1994, 144). For Richardson, coherence among ends need not\nresult in their being commensurable (1994, 180). \nThe second account is by Elijah Millgram (1997). Like Richardson,\nMillgram argues that value commensurability is not a prerequisite for\ndeliberation. However, in contrast to Richardson, Millgram argues that\npractical deliberation results in the commensurability of ends (1997,\n151). By this he means that through deliberation, one develops a\ncoherent conception of what matters and a “background against\nwhich one can judge not only that one consideration is more important\nthan another, but how much more important” (1997, 163).\nFor Millgram, commensurating one’s ends is a “central part\nof attaining unified agency” (1997, 162). \nMillgram proposes two ways in which deliberation results in the\ncommensurability of ends. The first proposal is that one can learn\nwhat is important and how it is important through experience (1997,\n161). The second proposal is that deliberation about ends is\n“something like the construction by the agent of a conception of\nwhat matters … out of raw materials such as desires, ends,\npreferences, and reflexes” (1997, 168).  Millgram\nidentifies an objection to each proposal and briefly responds to\neach. \nThe objection to the first proposal is this. If the incommensurability\nof ends can be resolved by experience, this suggests that the judgment\nof incommensurability reflects incomplete knowledge about the values\nexpressed in these ends. In other words, experience seems to help only\nif the values expressed in these ends are themselves commensurable\n(1997, 168). Millgram responds as follows. The agent who uses her\nexperience to develop a coherent conception of what matters is like\nthe painter who uses her experience to paint a picture that is not a\ncopy of an existing image. Even if the ends are commensurable in her\nconception of what matters, the values they reflect need not be\ncommensurable just as the painting need not be an exact copy of an\nexisting image. \nThe objection to the second proposal is this. The second proposal\nsuggests that deliberation is not driven by experience, which places\nit in tension with the first proposal. Millgram responds by continuing\nthe analogy with the painter. Imagine a painter who paints a picture\nthat is not a copy of an existing image. Just because the painting is\nnot a copy of an existing image does not mean there is no source of\ncorrection and constraint on it. Similarly, deliberation may involve\nthe construction by the agent of a conception of what matters, but\nthis does not imply that it is not informed or constrained by\nexperience (1997, 168-169). \nThis discussion points to two areas of further inquiry that bear on\nthe topic of incommensurability. First, does coherence among ends\nentail their commensurability? Second, leaving aside the issue of the\ncommensurability of ends, more needs to be said about what is required\nto deliberate rationally about what matters when that deliberation\ninvolves incommensurable values. \nAs discussed above, social practices and institutions play a role in\nthe inquiry into value incommensurability. They are claimed by some\nphilosophers to ground the possibility of value incommensurability, as\nin the case of constitutive incommensurability (subsection 3.2), and\nto help resolve value conflicts, as in the case of providing external\nresources for practical reason (subsection 4.4). This section\ndiscusses additional areas in which considerations about social\ninstitutions intersect with the inquiry into value\nincommensurability. \nTo begin, some philosophers have pointed to a structural similarity\nbetween a single individual trying to choose in the face of\nincommensurable values and the process of incorporating the varied\ninterests and preferences of the members of society into a single\ndecision. The preferences of different individuals, for example, may\nbe taken to reflect differing evaluative judgments about alternatives\nso that combining these different preferences into a single decision\nbecomes analogous to resolving value conflicts in the individual case.\nGiven this analogy, Fred D’Agostino has applied methods of\ndecision-making at the social level from social choice theory and\npolitical theory to consider the resolution of value conflicts at the\nindividual level (2003). \nAt the same time, Richard Pildes and Elizabeth Anderson caution\nagainst wholeheartedly adopting this analogy. The analogy, according\nto them, assumes that individuals already have rationally ordered\npreferences. Given value incommensurability, however, there is no\nreason to make such an assumption. In turn, Pildes and Anderson argue\nthat “individuals need to participate actively in democratic\ninstitutions to enable them to achieve a rational ordering of their\npreferences for collective choices” (1990, 2177). \nValue incommensurability also has been considered with respect to the\nlaw. Matthew Adler discusses the variety of ways in which legal\nscholars have engaged the topic of value incommensurability (1998).\nOne question is whether the possibility of value incommensurability\nposes a problem for evaluating government policy options and laws,\nmore generally. Some authors respond that it does not. Cass Sunstein,\nfor example, argues that recognition of value incommensurability helps\n“to reveal what is at stake in many areas of the law”\n(1994, 780). According to Sunstein, important commitments of a\nwell-functioning legal system are reflected in recognizing value\nincommensurability. \nMore generally, a number of scholars have focused on the relation\nbetween value incommensurability and the structure of social and\npolitical institutions. John Finnis, for example, takes the\nopen-endedness of social life to render it impossible to treat legal\nor policy choices as involving commensurable alternatives (1997,\n221-222). Michael Walzer’s account of distributive justice also\nrelates value incommensurability to the structure of social and\npolitical institutions. According to Walzer (1983), different social\ngoods occupy different “spheres,” each one governed by a\ndistinct set of distributive norms. What is unjust is to convert the\naccumulation of goods in one sphere into the accumulation of goods in\nanother sphere without regard for that second sphere’s\ndistributive norms. Underlying Walzer’s account, it seems, is a\ncommitment to a kind of constitutive incommensurability. Given its\nconnection to the possibility of plural and incompatible ways of life,\nthe concept of value incommensurability also plays a role in many\naccounts of political liberalism, including Joseph Raz’s account\n(1986) and Isaiah Berlin’s account (1969). It is the\nlatter’s inquiry into the relation between incommensurable\nvalues and political institutions that can be credited with motivating\nmuch of the contemporary inquiry into value incommensurability.","contact.mail":"nhsieh@hbs.edu","contact.domain":"hbs.edu"}]
