He mentioned only in passing that an agent\nwho violates the probability axioms would be vulnerable to having a\nbook made against him and this has led to considerable debate and\nconfusion both about exactly what Ramsey intended to show and about if,\nand how, a cogent version of the argument can be given. The basic\nidea behind the argument has also been applied in defense of a variety\nof principles, some of which place additional constraints on an\nagent’s current beliefs, with others, such as Conditionalization,\npurporting to govern how degrees of belief should evolve over\ntime.\n\n\nThe conclusion of the DBA is that the degrees of belief, or credences,\nthat an agent attaches to the members of a set \\(X\\) of sentences,\nstatements, or propositions, should satisfy the axioms of probability.\nThe basic axioms of probability are generally taken as requiring that\nfor \\(A \\in X\\), \n\nCondition 2, which requires only that the truths of propositional\nlogic are given the value one, is sometimes replaced with \n\nor even \n\nThe distinctions between these formulations of the axioms bear on\nthe objects that probabilities are to be taken as attaching to and on the\nreasonableness of the argument’s conclusion; but, for the\nimmediate purpose of outlining the basic argument, the differences are\nnot crucial. \nThe DBA itself begins with the so-called Dutch Book theorem, which\nconcerns the conditions under which a set of bets guarantees a net loss\nto one side, or a Dutch Book. With de Finetti, it is here assumed that\na bet on a proposition \\(H\\) is an arrangement that has the following\ncanonical form: \n\nThe table gives the net payoff to an agent who buys a bet with stake\n\\(S\\) for the price \\(qS\\), where \\(S\\) is won\nif \\(H\\) is true. \\(S\\) is called the\nstake, as it is the total amount involved in the wager, that\nis the payoff in the case that \\(H\\) is true together with the\namount forfeited if \\(H\\) is false. The quantity \\(q\\) is called\nthe betting quotient, which is the amount lost if \\(H\\) is\nfalse divided by the stake. The Dutch Book theorem can now be\nstated: \n\nGiven a set of betting quotients that fails to satisfy the\nprobability axioms, there is a set of bets with those quotients that\nguarantees a net loss to one side. \n\nIt is easy to show how it is possible to make book against someone\nwith betting quotients that violate the probability axioms. Let\n\\(Q(H)\\) be the agent’s betting quotient for \\(H\\). Assuming that\nthe agent’s betting quotients violate the axioms, a bookie can\nguarantee himself a profit by placing bets with the agent as described\nbelow. For simplicity the stake is set here at $1, but the\nfollowing recipes for constructing a book against such a person are\neasily adapted for other stakes. \n\nAxiom 1: Suppose that \\(Q(H) \\lt 0\\). In this case, the\nbookie buys the bet that pays $1 if \\(H\\) is true and 0 otherwise,\nfor the negative price \\(Q(H)\\), which means that the agent\ncollects \\(Q(H)\\), and pays out $1 if \\(H\\) is true, and\n$0 otherwise. Here the agent is betting against \\(H\\) and the\npayoff table for the agent is as follows: \n\nSince \\(Q(H)\\) is negative, the agent will suffer a net loss regardless\nof the truth-value of \\(H\\). \n\nAxiom 2: Suppose that an agent’s betting quotient for a\ntautology (or a logical or necessary truth) \\(H\\) is not equal to\n1. If \\(Q(H) \\gt 1\\) the bookie sells the bet that pays $1 if \\(H\\) is\ntrue and 0 otherwise, for \\(Q(H)\\). In the case where \\(Q(H) \\lt 1\\),\nthe bookie will buy the bet in which the agent pays the bookie $1 if\n\\(H\\) is true, and nothing if \\(H\\) is false, for \\(Q(H)\\). In this\ncase, the payoff table for the agent will again be as above for axiom\n1.  Notice that since \\(H\\) is a tautology (or logical or necessary\ntruth) it must be true, which means that at the conclusion of the bet,\nthe agent will have lost [\\(1-Q(H)\\)]. \n\nAxiom 3 (Additivity): Assume that\n\\(H_{1}\\) and \\(H_{2}\\) are mutually exclusive and\nthat \\(Q(H_{1}\\vee H_{2})\n\\ne Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\\).\nThere are two cases, \n\nIf \\(Q(H_{1}\\vee H_{2}) \\lt Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\\), then the bookie\nwill offer the agent the bet that pays $1 if \\(H_{1}\\) and 0 otherwise\nfor \\(Q(H_{1})\\) and the bet that pays $1 if \\(H_{2}\\) is true and 0\notherwise for \\(Q(H_{2})\\). The bookie then buys the bet that will pay\nhim $1, if \\((H_{1}\\vee H_{2})\\) is true and 0 otherwise, for the\nprice of \\(Q(H_{1}\\vee H_{2})\\). The possible payoffs to the agent are\nsummed up in the following table: \n\nSince \\(Q(H_{1}\\vee H_{2})\n\\lt Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\\),\nthe agent loses in each case and thus the collection of bets assures a\nloss. If \\(Q(H_{1}\\vee H_{2})\n\\gt Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\\),\nthen the bookie simply reverses the direction of the bets. \nLetting \\(V(H)\\) be the payoff if \\(H\\) is true, the\nexpected value of a bet on\n\\(H\\) is expressed by the equation: \n\nThus, for each axiom, the individual bets involved in making the\nbook are fair, which is to say they have an expected value of zero,\nwhen calculated using the agent’s betting quotients, yet\ncollectively they will produce a sure loss. The Dutch Book\nargument assumes that an agent’s degrees of belief are linked\nwith her betting quotients. This together with the theorem\nestablishes that degrees of belief that violate the probability axioms\nare associated with bets that are fair in the above sense, but that\nlead to a sure loss. The argument then concludes that agents\nought to obey the axioms. This leaves open just what the\nassociation amounts to and what sort of problem the prospect of such\nsure loss is supposed to be. \nThe Dutch Book argument has often been presented as establishing that\ndegrees of belief that violate the axioms are irrational because they\ncan (or do) lead to bad consequences. It assumes that an agent’s\ndegrees of belief are associated with her betting quotients such that\n(1) for an agent with degree of belief \\(q\\) in \\(M\\) a bet on\nor against \\(M\\) at corresponding odds will be acceptable. With\npayoffs in dollars and stake \\(S\\), this amounts to the claim that\nthe agent should be willing to take either direction of a bet with a\ncost of $\\(Sq\\) that pays \n\nBut then (2) by the Dutch Book theorem a cunning bettor could assure\nhimself a profit from someone who violates the probability\naxioms. Since (3) violating the axioms leaves the bettor open to\nbeing Dutch Booked (that is, being on the losing side of the Dutch\nBook) because her degrees of belief make acceptable bets leading to a\nsure loss, it is concluded that (4) one ought to satisfy the\nprobability axioms (i.e. that probabilism is true). In some\npresentations, the first premise is strengthened to the claim that the\nagent actually will accept those bets on \\(M\\) for which her degree of belief\nmatches the betting quotient, in an effort to tighten the connection\nbetween violating the axioms and the sure loss. \nA bit of terminology is in need of clarification here. De Finetti\nidentified degrees of belief with betting quotients and termed degrees\nof belief that are susceptible to a Dutch Book incoherent;\nthose that are not so susceptible he called coherent (de Finetti\n1937). ‘Susceptible’ here should be understood in the\nsense of the above theorem, namely that bets are specifiable\ncorresponding to those degrees of belief that will produce a sure loss\nto one side. Given the theorem, coherence amounts to satisfaction of\nthe probability axioms, with incoherence involving their violation,\nand accordingly the terms are often used as a shorthand way of\nspecifying whether the axioms are satisfied. However, both Ramsey and\nde Finetti took incoherence to be a kind of inconsistency, and some\nuse the term in this sense.  There are various questions about\nunderstanding violation of the probability axioms and susceptibility\nto a Dutch Book in this way, as will be discussed, and so here it will\nbe best to use ‘incoherent’ for degrees of belief that\nviolate the probability axioms, and that by the Dutch Book theorem are\nassociated with susceptibility to a sure loss. \nThere is reason to accept the conclusion of the DBA that one ought to\nsatisfy the probability axioms so as to avoid a Dutch Book only insofar\nas satisfying the axioms affords at least the possibility of avoiding\nexposure to a sure loss (Hájek 2005, 2008).\nHere, the Converse Dutch Book theorem, proven independently by Lehman\n(1955) and Kemeny (1955), plays an important role. Roughly\nstated the result is that \n\nIt assures that the agent would not be exploitable in any event, and\nthus establishes an advantage to obeying the axioms. Notice that the\ntheorem states that having betting quotients adhering to the axioms\nassures that one will not be susceptible to a sure loss, rather than\nmaking just the minimal claim required to establish an advantage to\ncoherence that such vulnerability may be avoided. \nBoth the Dutch Book theorem and its converse are sensitive to the\nformulation of the axioms, as well as to the understanding of\n‘bet’, ‘sure loss’ and what it means for such a\nloss to be guaranteed. Special care must be taken with the\ncharacterization of the probability axioms when it comes to the\nConverse Dutch Book theorem. Given that the axioms are formulated\nsuch that the second axiom only requires that tautological sentences\nreceive probability one, it is possible to satisfy the axioms, yet\nstill be open to a sure loss. Consider the claim that if \\(b\\) has \\(F\\)\nthen something has \\(F\\). This is not tautological, but betting\nagainst it would leave one vulnerable to a sure loss. Sometimes\nthe second axiom is instead formulated as requiring that all logical\ntruths receive probability one, but satisfying this constraint leaves\nopen the possibility of a sure loss by betting against a necessary\ntruth such as ‘nothing is both red and green all\nover’. Even with strengthening the second axiom to require\nthat all necessary truths receive probability one, there is still a\nreading upon which the Converse Dutch Book theorem is false, since an\nagent will be vulnerable to a sure loss if she attaches a probability\nless than one to a known truth (or a probability greater than zero to a\nknown falsehood). One response to this is to restrict ‘sure\nloss’ to those losses that do not depend on contingent\nfacts. Instead the restriction could be made to losses that are\n‘sure’ in the sense that there is a mechanical formula for\ninflicting the loss, thus removing the sort of counterexample to the Converse\nDutch Book theorem with which we began, and the need to strengthen the\naxioms. A related move involves restricting the allowable bets,\nrather than limiting what counts as a sure loss. \nIn observing that the Dutch Book theorem and the DBA are sensitive to\nthe formulation of the probability axioms, it should be noted that\nwhereas classical logic is generally presumed, probability axioms can\nbe formulated, with suitable adjustments, for non-classical\nlogics. Weatherson argues that this is appropriate in representations\nof rational belief, and formulates axioms of probability that are\nbuilt upon an intuitionistic logic, for which he then gives a Dutch\nBook argument (Weatherson 2003).  \nIt is clear that in order for the Dutch Book theorem to hold,\n‘sure loss’ must be taken to mean loss if the bets are in\nfact placed and settled. Violation of the probability axioms under any\nof their formulations does not guarantee an actual loss. Still more\nmust be said here about the meaning of ‘sure loss’, which\nsuggests some sort of necessity but does not tell us whether this is\nsupposed to be a particular form of logical necessity, metaphysical\nnecessity, or perhaps some other relative necessity. If\n‘sure loss’ were taken as foreseeable loss, then an agent\ncould violate the axioms by attaching positive probability to a\nnecessary falsehood, where there is no foreseeable loss given the\ncurrent state of knowledge concerning the proposition in\nquestion. There is also an issue concerning whether it is the\nagent who must be able to foresee the loss. If ‘sure’\nmeans decidable, then neither the formulation that logical nor that\nnecessary truths receive probability one will do, since there is no\ndecision procedure for determining in general whether a given sentence\nis a logical truth, let alone a necessary one. Clearly, there is\na delicate balance that must be struck between the formulation of the\nprobability axioms, and the understanding of ‘bets’ and\n‘sure loss’ for the Dutch Book theorem and its converse to\nhold. \nThere is a further issue with the Converse Dutch Book theorem, because\nthere are books that can be made against agents who violate other\nprobabilistic norms, such as Reflection, countable additivity and\nothers (see sections 3, 4, and 5). Satisfaction of the basic\naxioms is no guarantee that one will not be open to a book due to\nviolation of some other norm. A correct formulation of the\ntheorem must accordingly restrict the form and number of the allowable\nbets. Kemeny and Lehman put restrictions on the allowable bets (for\nexample their betting systems are restricted to a finite number of\nbets), which seem to rule out such counterexamples. However, it\nremains to be shown that avoiding book with such a restricted set of\nbets suffices to justify adherence to the axioms. The problem\nhere becomes especially pressing with the observation, discussed in the\nfollowing section, that incoherent agents need not be generally\nvulnerable to a sure loss, and thus that both coherent and incoherent\nagents alike may be subject to some books and not others. What is\nneeded in arguing for adherence to the probability axioms is the\nfurther claim that the bets which lead to sure losses and that are associated\nwith incoherence pose a special problem, although it seems that this\nthreatens the use that many proponents of the DBA have wanted to\nmake of Dutch Book arguments in defending other norms. \nA related problem concerns the assumption made in the version of the\nDBA presented in section 1.2 that agents will accept, or at least find\nacceptable, those ‘fair bets’ on or against \\(P\\) where\ntheir degree of belief matches the betting quotient for the bet. As\ndiscussed in the next section, it is not true that all such bets will\nbe accepted, or even be regarded as acceptable, and additional bets\nmay be accepted (or found acceptable). For various reasons someone\nmight accept bets in cases where her credences do not correspond to\nthe betting quotients of those bets, including where the bets\nconstitute a Dutch Book. Thus, we need to be concerned more generally\nwith the array of bets that agents will accept (or find\nacceptable). But since this widens the class of bets that can be used\nto produce a book, if anything it makes the problem for the DBA that a\ncoherent agent may be subject to a Dutch Book even worse.  The version\nof the DBA in section 1.2 could be modified with the claim that agents\naccept (or find acceptable) only bets that are fair or favorable, that\nis those with a non-negative expected value as calculated using their\ndegrees of belief. This rules out some additional bets that would\nproduce a Dutch Book for a coherent agent, but not those that enter\ninto the DBAs for other norms. However, this assumption does not hold\ngenerally, and fails to address other issues confronting the\nargument. \nAs noted above, the sure loss guaranteed by the Dutch Book theorem need\nnot amount to an actual loss. Indeed a bookie could reverse the\ndirection of the bets that would guarantee a loss for an incoherent\nagent so as to guarantee her a win, or there could be some sort of\nother prize that might be awarded for being incoherent. An\nincoherent agent might not be confronted by a clever bookie who could,\nor would, take advantage of her, perhaps because she can take effective\nmeasures to avoid such folk. Even if so confronted, the agent can\nalways prevent a sure loss by simply refusing to bet. It won’t do\nto respond to such a possibility by insisting on the stronger\nassumption that an agent will always take bets where the expected value\nof each is non-negative, because this simply gives the argument a false\npremise. In any case, it is clear that the trouble with being\nincoherent cannot be that it will lead to losses. Rather, the\nidea behind the version of the argument in section 1.2 should be taken\nto be that incoherence opens one up to sure losses, in a way that\nhaving coherent beliefs does not (given an appropriate version of the\nConverse Dutch Book theorem), and that such potential vulnerability\ndemands adherence to the axioms. \nWe may question whether either the conclusion that incoherence is\nirrational or that one ought to satisfy the axioms follows from simply\nbeing open to a sure loss. If the threat of such a loss is seen\nas unlikely, say, if the agent thinks she won’t face a clever\nbookie, has confidence that her charms will prevent her from ending up\non the losing side of a Dutch Book, or just thinks she won’t\ntake bets leading to a Dutch Book if they are offered, then it is hard\nto see why the mere potential of a sure loss should demand coherence.\nAnother problem here is the special status accorded to sure\nlosses. In fact the potential sure loss is symmetric with a\npossible sure gain. As Hájek emphasizes, there is a\ncorresponding “Czech Book Argument”, which parallels the\nDBA, with the conclusion that one ought to violate the probability\ncalculus (Hájek 2005, 2008). Construed as above,\nthe DBA appears to be canceled out by the “Czech Book\nArgument”, although Hájek shows that the potential\ncanceling out can be avoided by reformulating the DBA with the\nassumption that the agent should accept bets that are either fair or\nfavorable (Hájek 2008). Still, it is compatible with the\nDutch Book theorem that an incoherent agent could end up on the side of\na sure gain, and so incoherence cannot be condemned as irrational\nsimply by citing the possibility of sure losses. \nAlthough the threat of a sure loss may be remote, and an agent could\nface a sure gain, there are some situations in which incoherence is\nmore closely tied to actual losses. Some versions of the DBA appeal to\nsuch scenarios as a preliminary to attempting to establish the general\nirrationality of being incoherent. One tactic has been to argue that\nincoherence is irrational in so-called forced betting situations, and\nthen that the prohibition against being incoherent in such situations\ncan be universalized (Jackson and Pargetter 1976). In a forced betting\nsituation the agent is required to post betting quotients, and then to\nplace bets with those quotients, where the stake and direction of the\nbets are dictated by an opponent. Assuming that the only source of\nvalue is the money (valued linearly) involved in the wagers, it is\nclaimed that it is irrational to be incoherent in such a\nsituation. But this doesn’t follow if the irrationality is taken\nas arising from actual losses that would result. Even in a forced\nbetting scenario, there may be reasons to suppose that incoherent\nbetting quotients will not be taken advantage of, as may occur if\nmaking book would require knowledge of some very complicated logical\ntruth (Kennedy and Chihara 1979). Here too, the direction of the bets\ncould be chosen so that an incoherent agent will have a sure\ngain. This would be an odd forced betting situation, but if the agent\nhad reason to believe that this would occur, it could actually be\nadvisable for her to post incoherent odds. \nOne might begin instead with a competitive betting situation, in which\nit is given that both sides attempt to maximize their gain. Here\nthere is a closer connection between incoherence and loss, since the\nbookie will be trying to maximize his profit, and so a sure gain for an\nincoherent agent could only be the result of a mistake. If it is\nassumed that the agent is also forced to bet and that the bookie will\nact optimally, the agent should post coherent odds, for otherwise she\nwill be subject to a bankrupting Dutch Book. Of course if the\ncompetitive situation is one in which the agent can refuse to bet,\nhaving incoherent betting quotients need not leave her open to an\nactual loss. \nEven in those forced betting situations and competitive betting\nsituations in which it is irrational to post incoherent betting\nquotients, it still need not be irrational to have incoherent degrees\nof belief (Kennedy and Chihara 1979; Adams and Rosenkrantz\n1980). For example, if the agent must post odds on what she knows\nto be either a logical truth or a logical falsehood in a forced betting\nsituation, she may be better off with a betting quotient of either 1 or\n0, rather than some intermediate value, for she is susceptible to a\nDutch Book in the latter event, but she could end up with the\nobjectively correct value in the former case and thus would avoid a\nloss. But it seems that she can have reasons for an intermediate\nlevel of confidence, making such an evaluation more rational, at least\nin the sense of reflecting her available evidence, than an extreme\none. Alternatively the agent may simply have no idea whatsoever\nabout the logical status of what is in fact a logical truth upon which\nshe must post odds, in which case a confidence of .5, or perhaps\nremaining entirely agnostic by not adopting any particular level of\nconfidence, seems more reasonable than her being fully confident\ndespite her ignorance. \n\nAt the least, such examples raise questions about the connection\nthat the DBA presupposes between partial beliefs and\nfavorable/unfavorable betting odds. In the case where an agent\nmust give her betting quotient for what is in fact a logical truth, any\nvalue less than one leaves her vulnerable to a sure loss, possibly a\nbankrupting one, yet in such cases not all such credences are\nrationally on a par. The issue here seems to be more than simply\none about how well the underlying theory of action and belief works for\nextreme values, but also about the relevant conception of rational\nbelief. Rational action-guiding credences should generally\nreflect the agent’s evidence, yet at least in the cases above,\nprobabilism seems sometimes to require that they do not. One may\nquestion whether the appropriate or intended sense of\n‘rational’ is invoked in these cases in which it seems\nright to say that rational beliefs can come apart from betting\nquotients, but such objections just highlight the lack of clarity in\nmost presentations of the argument over what sort of rationality is\nsupposed to be at stake. It has been said, for instance, that it\nis ideal rationality that demands adherence to the axioms, but this\nnotion too is unclear. What can be said though is that there are\ncases in which degrees of belief do satisfy an important ideal of\nrationality but where they seem to come apart from betting quotients,\nand this puts additional pressure on the premise that agents should be\nwilling to accept bets where their degrees of belief match the betting\nquotient. \nNeither a forced nor a competitive betting situation per se guarantees\nthat incoherence will result in actual losses, and even in the special\ncases in which it would bring them about, it appears that having\nincoherent degrees of belief need not be irrational. Indeed,\nwhereas degrees of belief may generally be thought of as guides to\naction, and as well-modeled by betting quotients in many cases, forced\nand competitive betting situations in fact reinforce the point that\nthey are not always straightforwardly linked. Thus, arguments for\nthe claim that incoherence is generally irrational that begin with the\nclaim that it is irrational in forced betting situations fail to \nget off the ground, let alone show that it is irrational outside of\nsuch situations, where the connection between incoherence and the\npossibility of losses is even more tenuous. Still, forced and\ncompetitive betting situations are helpful in identifying rational\nconstraints under idealized conditions, and can serve as useful models\nof action in some situations. Under highly circumscribed\nconditions, where the agent’s goals are limited, they show that\nit is prudent to post coherent betting quotients. It is a bad feature\nof incoherent betting quotients, whether or not they correspond to such\ndegrees of belief, that in a forced betting situation they provide the\nopportunity for a clever bookie to inflict a sure loss, and guarantee\nit in competitive ones with a utility-maximizing opponent. But,\nthe special conditions that make it rational to have coherent betting\nquotients, so as to avoid a sure loss, are not met in general. In\nsome circumstances, a small sure loss can be better than the chance of\na greater loss. Additionally, where there is something of value\nthat is linked to a wager besides the stake, it can also be rational to\nact so as to bring about a sure loss on a bet. \nAside from the reasons given above for the fact that it can be rational\nto leave oneself open to, or act so as to guarantee, a sure loss,\nsituations in which the value of a bet is not fully represented by its\nmonetary payoff conditions present challenges for versions of the DBA\nthat take the problem with incoherence as stemming from the threat of\nlosing money. An agent may not wish to risk losing money on a\nlarge bet, due to additional bad consequences that would or might\nensue, or the agent may suffer anxiety over the prospect of loss.\nDe Finetti and others insist on limiting the stakes in an effort to get\naround this problem, but Ramsey already observed that one might have a\n“reluctance to bother with trifles”, which is to say that\nthere is a negative value to placing bets with little potential\ngain. Perhaps there is some range for which the stakes are\nneither too high nor too low, such that the monetary payoffs may be\ntaken as at least a reasonable approximation of the value of the bets,\nbut this further limits the situations in which a sure loss may be\ninflicted. \nAnother problem involving the value of bets arises in establishing the\nadditivity axiom, for even if each in a set of bets is acceptable, it\ndoes not follow that they would be jointly acceptable. Consider a\nperson with 4 dollars, who needs 2 dollars for bus fare. He might\nbe willing to take either one of two wagers that cost 2 dollars for a\nchance at winning enough money to buy a newspaper to read on the ride,\nbut be unwilling to risk all 4 dollars, and the possibility of having\nto walk home. One response here is to insist that the bets should\nbe presented in terms of utilities rather than money, although this\nraises difficulties of its own, since these are not objective\ncommodities. Such an approach involves assuming either directly\nor indirectly that such utilities are additive, but even this is not\nenough. While it may plausibly be argued that given a set of\ncredences and utilities, pragmatic rationality requires maximizing\nexpected value with respect to those credences and utilities, so that\nan agent with incoherent degrees of belief is committed to accepting\nbets (paying off in utility) that lead to a sure loss, the problem for\nthe DBA remains that being so committed to a sure loss is still not\nnecessarily irrational. See (Maher 1993). \nIt is clear that the version of the DBA presented in section 1.2 is far\nfrom cogent. There is a gap between the agent’s degrees of\nbelief and the acceptance of bets that would produce a sure loss, and\nthe possibility of such a loss need not entail irrationality. One\ncan specify situations in which the connections are tighter, but this\nfails to establish the general claim of probabilism. \nA popular response to the objections to the DBA considered in section\none suggests that incoherence is not a pragmatic defect per se, and\nthat the Dutch Book is merely a dramatic device for illustrating a kind\nof logical defect. Skyrms (1987) attributes this reading\nof the DBA to Ramsey, finding support in his remarks that \nAdditional support for this interpretation can be found in\nRamsey’s assertion that the subject of his paper is the\nlogic of partial belief. \nMany authors, including Armendt (1993), Christensen (1996, 2004),\nHellman (1997), Howson and Urbach (1993), and more recently Briggs\n(2009) and Mahtani (2015) have endorsed and elaborated upon the idea\nthat violation of the probability axioms amounts to a kind of\ninconsistency. For example, Armendt (1993) tells us that it involves\nan inconsistency that is revealed by the fact that degrees of belief\nguide action, and that Dutch Book vulnerability amounts to giving\nconflicting evaluations to the same option(s). He calls this\n“divided-mind” inconsistency, which he says is a flaw of\nrationality. This fits the typical sort of case where an agent\nviolates additivity, and sometimes applies to violations of the other\naxioms, but incoherence does not always entail having two different\nevaluations of the same option. Although degrees of belief often serve\nas guides to action, they need not be tied to an evaluation of options\nat all. However, it is a fundamental assumption of most versions of\nthe DBA that credences do have such a role, as in the theories of\nRamsey and de Finetti, so it is of interest that even with this\nassumption, incoherence need not involve giving conflicting\nevaluations (Vineberg 2001). Consider for instance a person who is\nless than fully confident of Fermat’s Last Theorem, perhaps\nbecause they don’t know that it has been proven. On at least\nsome ways of understanding propositions, this need not entail\nattaching two different judgments to the same proposition. One could\nalso violate coherence by only attaching a probability of less than\none to a single proposition that is a logical truth, or one could\navoid different evaluations by having the same level of confidence in\nevery proposition. These examples aside, even the additivity axiom is\nproblematic on Armendt’s interpretation, for it requires, for\nmutually exclusive propositions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), that joint bets on\n\\(p\\) and on \\(q\\) amount to the same option as a bet on \\(p\\) or\n\\(q\\). This in turn presumes that values are additive, which goes\nbeyond simply having degrees of confidence in \\(p, q\\), and their\ndisjunction, although Armendt (1993) suggests that the assumption is\ngenerally met and appropriate for the purposes of the DBA. \nIn “Truth and Probability”, Ramsey assumes that, at least\nunder idealized conditions, degrees of belief manifest themselves in\npreferences for options. This allows Ramsey to characterize the\ninconsistency involved in violating the probability axioms in terms of\nviolating the axioms of rational preference. While he never claims that\ndegrees of belief are necessarily linked to preferences, the model of\nbelief and preference that he offers assumes such an association, and\nindeed a great achievement of the paper is what amounts to a\nrepresentation theorem establishing that an agent satisfying the axioms\nthat he specifies for rational preference can be represented as having\ndegrees of belief that satisfy the probability axioms. In the\nmodel he offers, degrees of belief serve as guides to action through\ntheir connection with preferences, so that therein at least incoherence\ndoes manifest itself in preference inconsistency. But the way\nthat Ramsey casts the inconsistency involved in violating the axioms in\nterms of preference inconsistency leaves it unclear that his goal of\ncharacterizing the logic of partial belief has been satisfactorily\nmet. One trouble is that it does not show us that the preference\ninconsistency to which incoherent beliefs are tied is appropriately\nanalogous to inconsistency for simple (or full) belief, which involves\nbelieving inconsistent propositions, i.e. a set of propositions that\ncannot all be true. Another worry is that in Ramsey’s model\ndegrees of belief are linked with preferences, and it seems that having\na degree of belief does not by its nature require any such connection\nwith preference and action. One can surely have finely graded\nbeliefs in propositions without those beliefs being connected to preferences.\nMoreover, consistency for full belief derives from the concept of\nbelief as holding propositions to be true and from the logic of\npropositions, without any such assumed tie to action, and although\nRamsey thought that such a connection was necessary to clarify the idea\nof partial belief, it seems that a fully analogous characterization of consistency\nfor partial belief should do without it. \nSeveral philosophers have sought to establish coherence as a\nconsistency constraint on degrees of belief through a version of the\nDBA that does not presuppose any definite connection between degrees\nof belief and preference (Christensen 1996, 2004; Howson and Urbach\n1993; Hellman 1997). These so-called depragmatized arguments\npurport to improve upon Ramsey’s treatment by making clear how\ncoherence is supposed to mirror the ordinary notion of\nconsistency. Howson and Urbach attempt this by identifying an agent’s\ndegree of belief in \\(M\\) with the bets she regards as fair, such\nthat for credence \\(q\\) in \\(M\\), a bet with cost\n$\\(Sq\\) that pays \nis taken as fair. They then employ the Dutch Book\ntheorem to argue that incoherent degrees of belief cannot in fact be\nfair betting quotients, and thus that incoherence involves taking a set\nof bets as fair that cannot be fair, which is supposed to parallel\nhaving inconsistent beliefs. \nThere are several problems that undermine Howson and Urbach’s\napproach. The most basic is that an agent with degree of\nbelief \\(q\\) in \\(M\\) need not regard bets of the above form as\nfair for a variety of reasons. To begin with she may simply lack the\nconcept of a fair bet. Secondly, she could have credence \\(q\\), yet\nacknowledge the bet above as explicitly unfair. For instance, if she\nknows \\(M\\) to be either a logical truth or a logical falsehood,\nbut has no idea which, her confidence that it is true could be\n½, though she may well know that this would not be a fair\nbetting quotient for it. Casting credences in terms of the bets that\nare regarded as fair is also problematic in that it appears to\nassociate degrees of belief with having certain full beliefs, which\nsome think should be avoided. The argument also clearly falters over\nthe additivity axiom, since even if an agent regards each of a set of\nbets as individually fair, they may not be collectively fair by her\nlights, so she need not evaluate the bets required to produce a book as\nfair bets. Here, and in the basic assumption about the individual bets\nthat an agent finds fair, it is in effect assumed that money acts as a\nmeasure of value. Not only is this not generally true, it calls\nattention to the fact that the argument has not really been\ndepragmatized. While Howson and Urbach do not rely on either the\nassumption that agents will (or should) act in accordance with their\ndegrees of belief or that they should be willing to accept either\ndirection of a fair bet, they do assume that agents make evaluations\nof bets, which are tied to the concept of pragmatic value. Maher\n(1997) argues that their way of spelling out fairness in terms of a\nprimitive concept of advantage, so as to avoid the notions of\npreference and utility, fails. Indeed, it is hard to see that the\nlatter notions can be avoided in explicating the concept of fairness,\nupon which their argument depends. \nA similar argument is offered by Christensen (1996), except that his\ndepragmatized DBA further weakens the connection between degrees of\nbelief and bets. Where Howson and Urbach specify that an agent will\nregard a bet as fair, Christensen assumes only that the bet is\nsanctioned as fair or justified by the agent’s beliefs, thus\navoiding the first objection to Howson and Urbach’s\ntreatment. He then invokes the Dutch Book theorem to argue that\nincoherent degrees of belief sanction as fair a set of bets that\ncannot be fair, and claims this reveals that incoherence is\nfundamentally an epistemic, and indeed a logical, defect. But\nhis argument clearly faces the previous difficulty over the additivity\naxiom since, even if two bets are sanctioned individually, it does not\nfollow that they are sanctioned jointly. In response to this\nproblem, Christensen (2004) modified his argument by restricting the\nassumption about the sanctioning of bets to “simple agents”\nwho value only money, value it linearly, etc., so that monetary payoffs\nfunction as utilities for them. He then argued that degrees of\nbelief that violate the probability axioms in a simple agent are\nrationally defective because they sanction bets that\nwould be guaranteed to lose money. From this he claimed that since it\nis the incoherent beliefs themselves that have been shown to be\ndefective, such beliefs are rationally defective in all\nagents. \nHere again, the pragmatic dimension of the argument seems to have been\nmerely submerged. Degrees of belief do not sanction bets in\nisolation from preference, and so the alleged defect in the simple\nagent who violates the probability axioms cannot be pinned merely on those\nbeliefs. Since it is not the simple agent’s\nbeliefs themselves that have been shown to be defective, but rather\nthose beliefs in combination with her preferences, the inference that\nincoherent degrees of belief are rationally defective in all agents is\ninvalid. For all that has been shown, such beliefs might be fine\nin combination with a different preference structure. Not only is\nit premature to conclude that incoherence is rationally defective\ngenerally, Christensen has not argued convincingly that\nincoherence is rationally or logically defective even in simple\nagents. It could be rational for a simple agent to be incoherent\nif she were surrounded by “Czech bookies”, who will offer\nbets so that she is on the winning, rather than the losing, side of the\nbook, because in this situation incoherence will lead to satisfaction\nof her one goal as a simple agent of increasing her monetary\ngain. Of course it is incoherence as a logical defect, rather\nthan one of means/ends rationality, that is Christensen’s focus,\nbut since sanctioning bets as fair that cannot be fair is not a\nproperty of incoherent credences alone, he has not shown\nincoherence to be on a par with inconsistency with full belief, where\nthe defect lies with the beliefs themselves. \nThe depragmatized DBAs attempt to use the Dutch Book theorem to show\nthat incoherent degrees of belief involve a kind of inconsistency on\ntheir own, irrespective of the way in which they link up with\nparticular preferences. But the claim of inconsistency here requires\nthat credences be tied to evaluations of fairness, which in turn\ninvokes a concept of valuation that goes beyond merely having degrees\nof belief. If an agent’s degrees of belief are incoherent, and\nhe makes evaluations of bets using the standard expectation rule, then\nthere will be bets (with payoffs in some measure of utility) such that\ncalculated individually these will have expected value zero, and will\nin this sense be fair by his lights, but which lead to a net loss, and\nso may be said to be unfair. The unfairness can be deduced from the\nagent’s beliefs and their connection with the agent’s\nutilities, which establishes the defect brought out by the Dutch Book\nas internal to the agent, marking a crucial difference between the\nloss so inflicted and the sort requiring superior factual knowledge on\nthe part of the bookie. While the linkage between the agent’s\ncredences and his evaluation of bets is crucial to this result, the\nneeded connection is independent of the agent’s particular\npreference for goods, and so it could be said that the failure to\ncorrespond to fair betting quotients is a property of the\nagent’s beliefs, as tied to evaluations of acts, yielding the\nresult that incoherent credences, appropriately connected with\npreference, display a property that is analogous to inconsistency for\nfull belief. \nThere is then a version of the DBA that seems close to what Ramsey had\nin mind, which claims that insofar as degrees of belief link up\nsuitably with preferences, incoherence is associated with a property\nmirroring inconsistency, although this still need not amount to\ndivided-mind inconsistency in Armendt’s sense, nor is it entirely\nakin to inconsistency for full beliefs, which are characterized\ndirectly without any assumed connection to preference and action. The\nagent by whose lights each of a set of bets looks fair although they lead\ncollectively to a Dutch Book, which can be set up by examining simply\nthe agent’s credences, has a system of evaluation that is\nself-defeating, and as such may be said to exhibit a form of\nirrationality. On this reading, the vulnerability associated with\nincoherence is theoretical, and linked closely with the agent’s\nutilities, which means that actual vulnerability depends not only upon\nan appropriately situated bookie, but also upon the availability of\nsuitable commodities that measure those utilities. With this in\nplace, bets can be fixed that constitute a book on the basis of the\nagent’s beliefs, but which are evaluated as fair by the\nagent’s lights. Notice that the previous points, that an\nagent might avoid book by refusing to bet and that one might end up on\nthe side of a sure gain, are now otiose, for here it is the\nagent’s evaluations, rather than their consequences that are\nimplicated by the Dutch Book. Still, the DBA depends upon the theory of\npreference and utility, and as Kaplan notes (Kaplan 1996), this does\nnot emerge straightforwardly from standard presentations of the\nargument of the sort considered in section one, nor in the\ndepragmatized versions, as observed in the previous section. \nThe assumptions of the DBA are significant. It is the agent’s\nsystem of credences together with the way they are involved in\nevaluating options that is implicated by the Dutch Book. To conclude\nthat simply having incoherent credences is irrational, a further\nargument is needed showing that rationality demands that credences be\nlinked to evaluations of bets as in the DBA, but there is little to\nsuggest that graded degrees of belief must be so connected. Indeed,\nthe DBA assumes not only that there is some connection between an\nagent’s credences and the evaluation of options, but that one\nshould evaluate a bet as fair if it has an expected value of zero,\nusing one’s credences with the standard expectation rule. This\nbuilds in that an agent’s credences are related such that for each\n\\(H\\), \nHedden has recently called attention to this assumption, which he\nterms Negation Coherence, noting that it follows from the claim that\ncredences satisfy finite additivity and normalization (Hedden\n2013). The premise of the DBA that connects credences with fair\nbetting quotients thus presupposes a significant part of the\nprobabilist’s claim.\n\n  \n\nEven assuming the appropriate kind of connection between credences and evaluations of\noptions, it may be objected still that the sort of inconsistency\nrevealed through Dutch Book vulnerability is not necessarily\nirrational, particularly in cases where this is due to the failure to\ngrasp some subtle or complex logical facts. It is hard to see\nthat rationality requires agents to attempt to remove such\ninconsistencies in their belief systems; indeed for most it would be\nboth hopeless and counterproductive. Nor does it seem correct to count\nas more rational the person who avoids inconsistency, by refusing to\nhave an opinion in the face of evidence, than the person with less than\nfull confidence in a logical truth, who takes the incomplete evidence\ninto account. One option is to insist that coherence is a\nrequirement on ideal agents. It might be suggested instead that\ncoherence is one of a number of ideals, whose satisfaction may\nsometimes conflict, and that an incoherent agent may still be rational\nin the sense that they have optimally managed their opinions in light\nof the totality of their goals and constraints. Whatever the\nconclusion about the irrationality of being incoherent though, with\nidealizing assumptions about the connection between degrees of belief\nand the evaluation of options, the DBA succeeds in establishing\nincoherence as an evaluative defect. \n\nGiven a countable infinity of mutually exclusive and exhaustive ways\n\\(W_i\\) in which the proposition \\(A\\) can be true,\nthe Principle of Countable Additivity requires that \n\nA Dutch Book argument can be constructed for the principle by\nextending the Dutch Book for finite additivity (Adams 1962; Jeffrey\n2004; Williamson 1999) by appealing to an infinite set of bets that\neach pay $1 if \\(W_i\\) is true for the price \\(\\pr(W_i)\\). In the case\nof the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity, there is an\nadditional reason beyond those for the basic argument to favor the\ninterpretation of it, as Jeffrey does, as establishing the principle\nas a consistency constraint, since the loss is purely\ntheoretical. There is no threat of an actual loss to an agent since\nthis would require an infinite series of bets, which cannot all be\nmade and settled. However, the principle itself is controversial,\nmaking the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity highly\nprovocative. Both de Finetti (1972) and Savage (1954) argued that the\nprinciple should not be invoked as a constraint on rational degrees of\nbelief. A consequence of the principle is that it prohibits positive\ncredences that are uniformly distributed over a countably infinite\npartition, and yet it seems at least acceptable, in the absence of a\nreason to favor some possibilities over others, to adopt such a\ndistribution. Intuitively, a uniform distribution ought to count as\nconsistent, which puts pressure on the idea, at least when it comes to\ncountable additivity, that Dutch Books reveal a defect that is\nsubstantially analogous to inconsistency. In the background, as with\nthe basic argument, the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity\nmakes significant assumptions about how degrees of belief are linked\nwith preference and assessments of value. For details concerning how\nthese relate to the demand that an agent’s degrees of belief\nsatisfy countable additivity, see (Seidenfeld and Schervish 1983). \nThe basic idea behind the Dutch Book argument for probabilism has been\nused in defense of a variety of principles that purport to govern how\nbeliefs should evolve over time. In each case, it is argued that\nthe agent who violates the principle is subject to a Dutch Book.\nHere, the bets involved are placed at different times, but there is an\nalgorithm for placing the bets that is available at the outset\nguaranteeing a profit to one side. Such arguments are generally\nreferred to as “Dutch Strategy” arguments. \nThere is a Dutch Book (strategy) argument purporting to show that an\nagent ought to change beliefs by Conditionalization, which is due to\nLewis (1999), but was first reported by Teller (1973). The Rule of\nConditionalization states that an agent with the probability function\n\\(\\pr_1\\) at time \\(t_1\\) who learns \\(E\\) and nothing stronger at\ntime \\(t_2\\) should obtain her new probability function \\(\\pr_2\\)\nfrom her old probability function by conditionalizing on \\(E\\),\ni.e. for each proposition \\(A\\), \\(\\pr_2(A) = \\pr_1(A\\mid E)\\). When\nan agent violates this rule by adjusting her probabilities such that\n\\(\\pr_2(A) \\lt \\pr_1(A\\mid E)\\), a bookie can inflict a sure loss by\nfirst selling the agent the following three bets: \n\nIf \\(E\\) is false, the agent has a net loss of [\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) -\\)\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A)\\)] \\(\\pr_{1}(E)\\). If \\(E\\) is true, then the\nbookie buys back a fourth bet: \n\nBets 1 and 2 together amount to a conditional bet on \\(A\\), which is\ncalled off if \\(E\\) is false. In the event that \\(E\\) is true, this bet\nis bought back at the lower price of \\(\\pr_{2}(A)\\). Bet 3\nspreads the expected winnings of that exchange in order to assure a\nprofit in the case that \\(E\\) is false. Thus, if \\(E\\) is true the agent\nsuffers a net loss of [\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) - \\pr_{2}(A)\\)]\n\\(\\pr_{1}(E)\\). If \\(\\pr_{2}(A) \\gt \\pr_{1}(A\\mid E)\\),\nthen the strategy involves reversing the direction of the above\nbets. Where dollars are taken as measures of utility, each bet is\nfair given the agent’s beliefs at the time offered. \nAs van Fraassen points out, the betting formula above does not yield an\nargument for the diachronic Principle of Conditionalization as stated\n(van Fraassen 1989). There is no strategy for the bookie that\nguarantees him a profit from an agent for whom\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A) \\ne \\pr_{1}(A\\mid E)\\)\nunless\nthe agent makes a commitment to violate the rule in a particular way in\nadvance. The idea that the above bets constitute a betting\nstrategy yielding a Dutch Book tacitly assumes that the agent’s\ndeviant rule \\(D\\) is fixed at time \\(t_{1}\\), before it is known\nwhether or not \\(E\\) is true, and that the agent is sure to follow the rule\nif \\(E\\) is learned. \n\nHowever, the bookie can guarantee himself a profit in some cases\neven if it is not assumed that the agent will follow though by placing\na side bet that he wins in the event that the agent does not change\nbeliefs as planned. The Dutch Strategy depends upon the fact that\nthe agent initially has some definite probability that he will shift\nprobabilities in the event that \\(E\\), in some particular way that is not\nthe result of conditionalization on \\(E\\). The Dutch Strategy\nargument in no way establishes that one must have such a probability,\nand so at most shows that one should not have a plan involving a fixed\nprobability to update upon learning \\(E\\) in a way that differs from\nconditionalizing on \\(E\\). \nEven where it is assumed that an agent is fully committed to following\nthrough on some deviant rule, there are questions about what the Dutch\nStrategy shows. As with the basic DBA for probabilism, it is possible\nto devise scenarios in which it would be rational to leave oneself\nopen to a Dutch Strategy by announcing a deviant updating rule, and so\nthe Dutch Strategy argument should not be taken to show that it is\nstrictly irrational to have an updating rule other than\nConditionalization. Rather, the existence of the strategy points to a\ntension in adopting such a rule. Shifting from \\(\\pr_{1}\\) to\n\\(\\pr_{2}\\) by conditionalizing on \\(E\\) is equivalent to\ninvariance, i.e. for each proposition \\(A\\),\n\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) =\\)\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\). Adopting a rule for updating other\nthan Conditionalization is thus tantamount to holding at\ntime \\(t_{1}\\) that for some \\(A\\),\n\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) \\ne\\)\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\). Note that the bookie simply takes\nadvantage of the difference between the agent’s probability for A\ngiven \\(E\\) at \\(t_{1}\\) and\nat \\(t_{2}\\). Where the agent is certain\nat \\(t_{1}\\) that he would update via some deviant\nrule \\(D\\), the rule induces a conditional probability at that time\nfor \\(A\\) given \\(E\\) that differs from\n\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E)\\). In such a case,\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\) is fixed at \\(t_{1}\\) by\nthe agent’s credal state, and so given that\n\\(\\pr_{1}(A\\mid E) \\ne\\)\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\), the agent’s credences may be said\nto exhibit a kind of inconsistency. While this is more problematic\nthan the sort of inconsistency involved in simply having different\nlevels of confidence for a proposition at different times, it appears\nless like inconsistency for full belief than failing to obey the\nprobability axioms, where the agent has evaluations according to which\neach in a set of bets is fair at a single time. While\n\\(\\pr_{2}(A\\mid E)\\) may be fixed at\n\\(t_{1}\\), this is not the agent’s conditional probability\nat \\(t_{1}\\), but rather the probability for \\(A\\)\ngiven \\(E\\) that she will come to have at \\(t_{2}\\) upon\nlearning \\(E\\). Such updating plans are part of the agent’s credal\nsystem though, for which Dutch Book vulnerability signals a\ndefect. The fact that there is a converse Dutch Book argument, as\nSkyrms (1987b) demonstrates, shows that the trouble is avoided by adhering\nto the Rule of Conditionalization, which has virtues over the sort of\ndiminished system of beliefs that avoids inconsistency by shunning an\nupdating rule. \nJeffrey proposes a further Generalized Conditionalization Rule (also\ntermed Probability Kinematics or Jeffrey\nConditionalization) to cover cases in which experience does not\nmanifest itself in some evidential proposition \\(E\\) shifting to\none, but rather stems from a shift in probabilities over some\npartition \\(\\{E_{i}\\}\\) (Jeffrey 1983). Jeffrey’s Rule\nstates that \nwhich is equivalent to the invariance condition that \\(pr_1(A\\mid E_i)\n= pr_2(A\\mid E_i)\\), for each element \\(E_i\\) of the partition. To\nmaintain that updating goes by Jeffrey Conditionalization is to\nmandate invariance for each proposition \\(A\\). This might seem to be\nrequired, as Armendt shows that a Dutch Strategy can be constructed\nagainst an agent who has a rule for updating that conflicts with\nJeffrey’s Rule (Armendt 1980). As with the Rule of\nConditionalization though, the Dutch Strategy does not show that there\nis any problem with shifting probabilities over a partition, and then\nabandoning one’s prior conditional probabilities over that\npartition, that is violating invariance; the problem is with adopting\na rule of this sort in advance. As with the simple Rule of\nConditionalization, Skyrms (1987b) shows that there is also a converse\nDutch Strategy argument showing that following Jeffrey’s Rule\navoids a Dutch Book. While the Rule of Conditionalization is generally\npresented as demanding that agents satisfy invariance for each\nproposition, and various authors have rightly complained that this\ndemands an unreasonable rigidity of belief (Bacchus, Kyburg, and\nThalos 1990; Levi 2002), Jeffrey does not treat the condition as a\nstrict requirement on rational belief change (Jeffrey 2004). He leaves\nopen the possibility that when probabilities are shifted over a\npartition, the conditional probabilities could change, although this\nleaves the unanswered question as to when invariance is reasonable to\nassume. In any case, as with the Simple Rule of Conditionalization,\nthe Dutch Strategy argument here tells in the same way against planned\nviolations of invariance. \nA Dutch Strategy argument has also been given for the controversial\nPrinciple of Reflection, which requires that for any proposition \\(A\\)\nand any future time \\(t\\), an agent’s current probability for\n\\(A\\) conditional on later assigning it probability \\(r\\) is itself\n\\(r\\), that is pr \\((A\\mid \\pr_{t}(A) = r) = r\\). In violating\nReflection, the agent fails to endorse certain of her possible future\njudgments, which as van Fraassen showed (van Fraassen 1984), opens the\ndoor to a Dutch Strategy. If the agent violates Reflection in that\n\\(\\pr(A\\mid \\pr_{t}(A) = r) \\gt r\\), the bookie sells the following\nbets: \nwhere \\(x = \\pr(A \\mid \\pr_{t}(A) = r)\\). \nIn the event that \\(\\pr_{t}(A) = r\\), the bookie then buys a fourth bet from\nthe agent on \\(A\\) with a prize of 1, with a price of the\nagent’s new probability. \nThe idea that the existence of such a strategy shows that agents\nshould satisfy Reflection has been widely disputed, even by many who\ntake the Dutch Book arguments for probabilism and conditionalization\nas having force. Much of the discussion stems from a variety of\ncounterexamples to Reflection in which it appears irrational\nnot to violate the principle. One example, due to Talbott, turns on\nthe fact that real agents lack perfect recall (Talbott 1991). He\nconsiders a person who had spaghetti \\((S)\\) the previous night,\nsay November 16, and contemplates the probability that she will give\nto her having eaten spaghetti on that day in year’s time. Since she\neats spaghetti on average one out of every ten days, she thinks it\nlikely that \\(\\pr_{t}(S) = 0\\).1. But surely she\nshould not assign a probability of 0.1 to her having had spaghetti the\nprevious night conditional on the claim that\n\\(\\pr_{t}(S) = 0\\).1, since she is nearly certain\n(say \\(\\pr_{t}(S) = 0\\).99) of what she had for\ndinner the previous night. \nThe forgetting that makes it reasonable to violate Reflection in\nTalbott’s spaghetti dinner example involves one type of limited\nfuture impairment. Christensen gives a different case in which an\nagent has just consumed a mind-altering drug (LSQ) that he expects in\nhour’s time will make him believe that he can fly, without\nconferring upon him any such power (Christensen 1991). However,\nthis is the only effect of the drug, so that the agent’s\nfaculties will remain otherwise acute. Before the drug takes\neffect, the agent should not take his probability that he can fly\nconditional on his coming to believe it in an hour to be high, as\nrequired by Reflection, because what he will think when under the\ninfluence is irrelevant to his ability to fly. A similar example\ninvolving Ulysses and the Sirens is discussed by van Fraassen (1995). \nIt is important in both of these examples that it is not only\nreasonable to violate Reflection, but that to do otherwise would\ninvolve failing to properly account for the evidence about the\nunreliability of one’s future beliefs. Christensen’s\nown response involves arguing that because the bets in diachronic Dutch\nBook arguments are made over time, unlike in the synchronic argument\nfor the probability axioms, they do not reveal a form of inconsistency\nthat is generally irrational. One of several troubles with this\nis that it would require rejecting the claim that the Dutch Strategy\nagainst agents who plan to violate Conditionalization reveals any sort\nof problematic inconsistency. Other problems with Christensen’s\nresponse are discussed in (Vineberg 1997). \nOthers have tried to respond to the counterexamples by distinguishing\nfeatures of the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection that do not\ninvolve dismissing all diachronic Dutch Book arguments. For\ninstance, Hitchcock emphasizes that it is important to consider what\nthe bookie knows in assessing the relevance of Dutch Books on an\nagent’s rationality (Hitchcock 2004). He observes that\nunlike the case in which an agent violates the probability axioms, and\nthe bookie can determine and place the bets with only the knowledge of\nthe agent’s beliefs, in Talbott’s example, the bookie may\nneed to exploit information that is unavailable to the agent in order\nto make the Dutch Book.  \nTaking into account what a bookie needs to know in order to guarantee\nhimself a profit fails to distinguish adequately between the Dutch\nBooks that appear to be norms of rationality and those that do\nnot. First, as Hitchcock acknowledges, this won’t work to\nresolve the tension between the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection\nand many of the other counterexamples. In Christensen’s\nexample, taking LSQ does not have any effect on memory, it merely\nchanges the agent’s evaluation of his ability to fly, that is, he\nchanges his view of a very limited bit of evidence, so that the Dutch\nStrategy can be carried out without the bookie having relevant\ninformation that the agent does not. \n\nStill, perhaps we might take the fact that book can be made without\nhaving knowledge beyond that of the agent as at least a necessary\ncondition for a telling book. Various cases, besides that of the\nspaghetti dinner, give plausibility to the idea that a Dutch Book only\nestablishes the unreasonableness of violating a particular principle\nwhen the book is made with no special knowledge not possessed by the\nagent. Consider an agent who violates the probability axioms in\nvirtue of failing to recognize some complicated logical truth.\nArguably this is not unreasonable, and setting up a Dutch Book in this\ncase would require knowledge that the agent lacks. But, insofar\nas the irrationality in violating the axioms stems from the fact that\nit is supposed to be a form of inconsistency, as both Hitchcock and\nChristensen maintain, then the fact that a bookie might need (logical)\nknowledge that the agent lacks in order to set up the book, is\nirrelevant to whether the book has force. Whether an\nagent’s beliefs are inconsistent, unlike the question of\nwhether she is to be regarded as reasonable, is independent of what she\nor anybody else knows.  \n\nBriggs offers another way of distinguishing those Dutch Books that\nmark the violation of a genuine norm from those that do not (Briggs\n2009). Her contention is that whereas the Dutch Strategy argument for\nConditionalization reveals what she terms incoherence, which she takes\nto be a form of inconsistency, the Dutch Strategy argument for\nReflection reveals merely self-doubt, which involves an agent who\nsuspects herself of incoherence. Briggs assumes that an agent’s\ncredences “condone” accepting certain bets as fair, and\nthat an agent’s credences admit of a Dutch Book just in case\nthose credences condone a set of bets that yield a net loss to the\nagent in every world where the agent has those credences and\naccordingly would condone the bets. Violating the probability axioms,\nConditionalization or Reflection makes one vulnerable to a Dutch Book\nin this sense. Briggs observes that the bets in the Dutch Books that\nmay be constructed against someone violating either the probability\naxioms or Conditionalization will yield a net loss in every possible\nworld; but, the bets in the Dutch Strategy against the violator of\nReflection will not result in a loss in certain worlds in which the\nagent’s beliefs differ from those that she has in the actual\nworld. Accordingly, Briggs suggests that incoherence is marked by\nDutch Books that involve bets that result in a loss in every world,\nand thus that violation of Reflection does not involve incoherence.\n \n\nThis way of attempting to save the Dutch Strategy argument for\nConditionalization, while jettisoning that for Reflection, is\ncriticized by Mahtani, who argues that Briggs’ test mistakenly\ncounts certain cases of mere self-doubt as incoherence (Mahtani\n2012). Recently, she proposed a new way of understanding Dutch Book\narguments as revealing incoherence, according to which an agent is\nincoherent if and only if she would accept as fair a set of bets that\nwould result in a loss under any interpretation of the claims involved\n(Mahtani 2015). With this understanding, violation of the probability\naxioms reveals incoherence, but violations of Reflection and cases of\nself-doubt in which the agent isn’t sure of her own credences do\nnot count as incoherence, as they do not involve proper Dutch Books\nthat result in a loss under any interpretation. As she discusses, this\nway of understanding Dutch Books leaves it open as to whether there is\na proper Dutch Book argument for Conditionalization.\n \n \n\nBoth Briggs and Mahtani extract the condition of incoherence from the\nfeatures of certain bets, though it remains unclear as to how\nprecisely the concept of incoherence, in their sense, is to be\nunderstood, i.e. how it is supposed to be analogous to\ninconsistency. Still, the discussion is important for there is some\nintuition that violating Reflection is less similar to holding\ninconsistent beliefs than violating the probability axioms. When it\ncomes to Conditionalization, Briggs takes the full principle as\nestablished by a Dutch Book argument, which as previously discussed\nappears too strong, since the consistency required by rationality does\nnot seem to require having a plan for updating. Indeed, precisely what\nsort of inconsistency is involved in cases where one is susceptible to\na Dutch Strategy on account of having an alternative updating rule to\nConditionalization remains unclear, and is perhaps a point in favor of\nMahtani’s analysis upon which the status of Conditionalization\nremains inconclusive.\n\n \nBoth proposals must contend with the subtle connection between\ncredences and bets. Mahtani associates credences with bets that the\nagent would accept as fair, but as previously noted, having credences\nneed not go along with accepting bets as fair in the way needed to\nconnect the violation of various probabilistic norms with a Dutch\nBook. While Briggs acknowledges that there is a complex relationship\nbetween credences and bets, her notion that credences condone certain\nbets also appears to be in the spirit of the depragmatized DBAs,\nwhich, as observed, suffer from various difficulties. The significance\nof distinguishing between different types of Dutch Books so as to mark\noff some as pointing to a form of incoherence is unclear.  Whereas one\nor the other of their proposals may comport better with our intuitions\nabout what is intuitively incoherent (or inconsistent), if we retain\nRamsey’s idea of credences as guides to action, then either way\nof distinguishing between Dutch Books looks problematic, since any\ncredences that lead to a sure loss are, at least to some extent,\ndefective as a guide to action.  \nAn interesting application of Dutch Strategy arguments has been made\nby Hitchcock to the perplexing Sleeping Beauty problem (Hitchcock\n2004). In the problem, Beauty is to undergo an experiment in which she\nwill be put to sleep on Sunday night, after which a fair coin will be\ntossed. If it comes up heads, she will be awakened just once for a\nshort time on Monday, and if tails she will also be awakened again on\nTuesday. In each case, after being awakened, she will be put back to\nsleep with drugs that will erase her memory of having been awake. On\nWednesday, she is awakened and the experiment ends. Beauty is aware of\nthese facts about the experiment, so that when she wakes up during the\nexperiment she will not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday. The\nproblem is to determine what her probability should be for heads upon\nawakening within the experiment. Elga introduced the problem into the\nphilosophical literature (Elga 2000), and argued that upon awakening\nBeauty should shift her probability from the value of \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\)\nthat she assigned on Sunday night to \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\). Lewis argued\nshortly thereafter that Beauty’s probability upon awakening\nshould remain at \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) (Lewis 2001), and additional\narguments have followed on both sides. Hitchcock shows that there is a\nDutch Strategy against either answer, but then argues that there is\nonly force to the one against Beauty if she sticks with\n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\). \nThe strategies serve as potential counterarguments to the two ways of\nanswering the problem, rather than showing that it is irrational to\nswitch to \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\) or stick with \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\) per se, since the individual\nstrategies depend upon the plan to have a particular probability upon\nawakening. If Beauty plans to switch to probability \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\) for heads,\nthe Dutch Strategy is just an application of the general strategy\nagainst someone who violates Reflection. Hitchcock argues that\nthis would not establish Beauty’s irrationality, since in this\ncase the bookie must know during the experiment what day it is in order\nto implement the strategy, which is information that Beauty\nlacks. On the other hand, if Beauty sticks with \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\), a strategy\ncan be carried out without the bookie having to know more than Beauty\nby having the bookie undergo the experiment with her and offer a bet\nagainst heads on Sunday and a bet on heads whenever Beauty and the\nbookie awake within the experiment. If the coin lands heads, the\nbookie sells Beauty just one bet on heads, with her gain totaling less\nthan her loss on the first bet against heads. If the coin lands\ntails, the bookie sells a bet on heads once on Monday and the same bet\nagain on Tuesday, so as to again produce a loss for Beauty.\nHitchcock takes this book to tell against the answer \\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\), and in favor\nof \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\). \nOne trouble with defending the answer of \\(\\bfrac{1}{3}\\) in this way\nis that what a bookie must know to assure himself a profit does not\ncharacterize what is essential to a proper Dutch Book. There is also a\nparticular reason to suppose that Beauty’s predicament is one in\nwhich reasonable degrees of belief and betting quotients can come\napart, because the third bet needed to make book in the switching case\nis only offered when it is sure to be a losing bet (discussed in\nVineberg 2004—see the Other Internet Resources, and Bradley and\nLeitgeb 2006). In this case the bookie exploits features of the\nexperiment, so that the strategy can be carried out without his\npossessing knowledge of the day. But the fact that the bets leading to\nbook are triggered by the circumstances suggests that it is not just\nBeauty’s beliefs on which the strategy depends, and hence the\nloss does not reflect a purely internal defect, despite the fact that\nthe bookie can implement the strategy without having access during the\nexperiment to knowledge that Beauty lacks. Draper and Pust also argue\nthat Hitchcock’s use of a Dutch Book argument is subject to an\nobjection from evidential decision theory (Draper and Pust 2008). \n\nDutch Books have also been used to show that there are limitations on\nthe proper applications of credences within the standard decision\ntheoretic framework. Given that the available evidence often appears\nto dictate only vague or interval-valued credences, it has been argued\nthat rationality permits having such unsharp credences. Elga uses a\nkind of reverse Dutch Book involving a series of bets that are sure to\nresult in a net gain for the agent to argue that credences must be\nsharp (Elga 2010). The idea is that a rational agent must accept at\nleast one of the bets in the series, but that there does not appear to\nbe a satisfactory set of decision rules for unsharp credences with\nthis consequence. \nMcGee constructs another type of Dutch Book with implications for\ndecision theory. Suppose that an agent’s probability function is\nnot concentrated at finitely many points. Such a state of opinion, in\nwhich the agent does not rule out all but a finite number of\npossibilities, seems both consistent and reasonable, yet assuming that\nan agent’s utilities are unbounded, McGee shows that there is an\ninfinite series of bets, each with positive expected value, which\ntogether assure a loss (McGee 1999). Assuming that it is reasonable to\nhave probabilities that are not concentrated at finitely many points,\nMcGee calls into question the general adequacy of the decision\ntheoretic framework, and in particular the principle of utility\nmaximization that his Dutch Book argument presumes. \nIt remains defensible that the Dutch Book argument shows that the\nprobability axioms are something like consistency constraints on\npartial belief, at least given some substantial decision-theoretic\nassumptions, unlike the idea that their violation is a pragmatic\nliability. But this interpretation is less successful for the various\nother norms for which Dutch Book arguments have been constructed. The\nDutch Strategy arguments for the Principle of Conditionalization and\nfor Jeffrey’s Rule do not fully support the norms, but only the\nweaker claim that one should not commit in advance to following an\nalternative rule, and the sense in which it may be said to be\ninconsistent to do so seems different from what is involved in\nviolating the axioms. The other claims considered here for which Dutch\nBook arguments have been constructed are even less plausibly regarded\nas consistency constraints, and thus seem to be a different sort of\nrequirement on ideal rationality.  This suggests the need to identify\n‘consistency’ with a narrower set of conditions than mere\nDutch Book vulnerability, if we are not to abandon the idea of the\nprobability axioms as a consistency constraint that extends the\nordinary concept and, perhaps, reject the DBA altogether. A more\nfine-grained analysis of the various Dutch Books might yield a way of\nmarking off those that point to genuine inconsistency from those\nexhibiting some other sort of defect. Briggs and Mahtani take steps in\nthis direction, but questions remain about the adequacy of their\napproaches.","contact.mail":"susan.vineberg@wayne.edu","contact.domain":"wayne.edu"}]
