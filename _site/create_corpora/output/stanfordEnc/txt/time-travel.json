Part of the great interest of the topic stems from the\nfact that reasons have been given both for thinking that time travel\nis physically possible—and for thinking that it is logically\nimpossible! This entry deals primarily with philosophical issues;\nissues related to the physics of time travel are covered in the\nseparate entries on \n time travel and modern physics\nand\n time machines.\n We begin with the definitional question:\nwhat is time travel? We then turn to the major objection to the\npossibility of backwards time travel: the Grandfather paradox. Next,\nissues concerning causation are discussed—and then, issues in\nthe metaphysics of time and change. We end with a discussion of the\nquestion why, if backwards time travel will ever occur, we have not\nbeen visited by time travellers from the future.\n\nThere is a number of rather different scenarios which would seem,\nintuitively, to count as ‘time travel’—and a number\nof scenarios which, while sharing certain features with some of the\ntime travel cases, seem nevertheless not to count as genuine time\n travel:[1] Time travel Doctor. Doctor Who steps into a machine in\n2024. Observers outside the machine see it disappear. Inside the\nmachine, time seems to Doctor Who to pass for ten minutes. Observers\nin 1984 (or 3072) see the machine appear out of nowhere. Doctor Who\nsteps out.[2] Leap. The time traveller takes hold of a special device\n (or steps into a machine) and suddenly disappears; she appears at an\n earlier (or later) time. Unlike in Doctor, the time\n traveller experiences no lapse of time between her departure and\n arrival: from her point of view, she instantaneously appears at the\n destination \n time.[3] Putnam. Oscar Smith steps into a machine in 2024. From\n his point of view, things proceed much as in Doctor : time\n seems to Oscar Smith to pass for a while; then he steps out in\n 1984. For observers outside the machine, things proceed\n differently. Observers of Oscar’s arrival in the past see a\n time machine suddenly appear out of nowhere and immediately divide\n into two copies of itself: Oscar Smith steps out of one; and (through\n the window) they see inside the other something that looks just like\n what they would see if a film of Oscar Smith were played backwards\n (his hair gets shorter; food comes out of his mouth and goes back\n into his lunch box in a pristine, uneaten state; etc.). Observers of\n Oscar’s departure from the future do not simply see his time\n machine disappear after he gets into it: they see it collide with the\n apparently backwards-running machine just described, in such a way\n that both are simultaneously\n annihilated.[4] Gödel.\n The time traveller steps into an ordinary rocket ship (not a special\ntime machine) and flies off on a certain course. At no point does she\ndisappear (as in Leap) or ‘turn back in time’\n(as in Putnam)—yet thanks to the overall structure of\nspacetime (as conceived in the General Theory of Relativity), the\ntraveller arrives at a point in the past (or future) of her\ndeparture. (Compare the way in which someone can travel continuously\nwestwards, and arrive to the east of her departure point, thanks to\nthe overall curved structure of the surface of the\nearth.)[5] Einstein. The time traveller steps into an ordinary\n rocket ship and flies off at high speed on a round trip. When he\n returns to Earth, thanks to certain effects predicted by the Special\n Theory of Relativity, only a very small amount of time has elapsed\n for him—he has aged only a few months—while a great deal\n of time has passed on Earth: it is now hundreds of years in the\n future of his time of \n departure.[6] Not time travel Sleep. One is very tired, and falls into a deep\n sleep. When one awakes twelve hours later, it seems from one’s\n own point of view that hardly any time has passed.  Coma.\nOne is in a coma for a number of years and then awakes, at which point\nit seems from one’s own point of view that hardly any time has\npassed.  Cryogenics. One is cryogenically frozen for hundreds of\nyears. Upon being woken, it seems from one’s own point of view\nthat hardly any time has passed.  Virtual. One enters a highly realistic, interactive\nvirtual reality simulator in which some past era has been recreated\ndown to the finest detail.  Crystal. One looks into a crystal ball and sees what\nhappened at some past time, or will happen at some future\ntime. (Imagine that the crystal ball really works—like a\nclosed-circuit security monitor, except that the vision genuinely\ncomes from some past or future time. Even so, the person looking at\nthe crystal ball is not thereby a time traveller.)  Waiting. One enters one’s closet and stays there\nfor seven hours. When one emerges, one has ‘arrived’ seven\nhours in the future of one’s ‘departure’.  Dateline. One departs at 8pm on Monday, flies for\nfourteen hours, and arrives at 10pm on Monday.  A satisfactory definition of time travel would, at least, need to\nclassify the cases in the right way. There might be some\nsurprises—perhaps, on the best definition of ‘time\ntravel’, Cryogenics turns out to be time travel after\nall—but it should certainly be the case, for example,\nthat Gödel counts as time travel\nand that Sleep and Waiting do\nnot.[7] \n\nIn fact there is no entirely satisfactory definition of ‘time\ntravel’ in the literature. The most popular definition is the\none given by Lewis (1976, 145–6): What is time travel? Inevitably, it involves a\ndiscrepancy between time and time. Any traveller departs and then\narrives at his destination; the time elapsed from departure to\narrival…is the duration of the journey. But if he is a time\ntraveller, the separation in time between departure and arrival does\nnot equal the duration of his journey.…How can it be that the\nsame two events, his departure and his arrival, are separated by two\nunequal amounts of time?…I reply by distinguishing time itself,\nexternal time as I shall also call it, from the personal time of a\nparticular time traveller: roughly, that which is measured by his\nwristwatch. His journey takes an hour of his personal time, let us\nsay…But the arrival is more than an hour after the departure in\nexternal time, if he travels toward the future; or the arrival is\nbefore the departure in external time…if he travels toward the\npast. This correctly excludes Waiting—where the length of\nthe ‘journey’ precisely matches the separation between\n‘arrival’ and\n‘departure’—and Crystal, where there is no\njourney at all—and it includes Doctor. It has trouble\nwith Gödel, however—because\nwhen the overall structure of spacetime is as twisted as it is in the\nsort of case Gödel imagined, the notion of external time\n(“time itself”) loses its grip. \n\nAnother definition of time travel that one sometimes encounters in the\nliterature (Arntzenius, 2006, 602) (Smeenk and Wüthrich, 2011, 5,\n26) equates time travel with the existence of CTC’s: closed\ntimelike curves. A curve in this context is a line in spacetime; it is\ntimelike if it could represent the career of a material object; and it\nis closed if it returns to its starting point (i.e. in\nspacetime—not merely in space). This now includes\nGödel—but it excludes Einstein. \n\nThe lack of an adequate definition of ‘time travel’ does\nnot matter for our purposes\n here.[8] \nIt suffices that we have clear cases of\n(what would count as) time travel—and that these cases give rise\nto all the problems that we shall wish to discuss. \n\nSome authors (in philosophy, physics and science fiction) consider\n‘time travel’ scenarios in which there are two temporal\ndimensions (e.g. Meiland (1974)), and others consider scenarios in\nwhich there are multiple ‘parallel’ universes—each\none with its own four-dimensional spacetime (e.g. Deutsch and Lockwood\n(1994)). There is a question whether travelling to another version of\n2001 (i.e. not the very same version one experienced in the\npast)—a version at a different point on the second time\ndimension, or in a different parallel universe—is really time\ntravel, or whether it is more akin to Virtual. In any case,\nthis kind of scenario does not give rise to many of the problems\nthrown up by the idea of travelling to the very same past one\nexperienced in one’s younger days. It is these problems that\nform the primary focus of the present entry, and so we shall not have\nmuch to say about other kinds of ‘time travel’ scenario in\nwhat follows. One objection to the possibility of time travel flows directly from\nattempts to define it in anything like Lewis’s way. The worry is\nthat because time travel involves “a discrepancy between time\nand time”, time travel scenarios are simply incoherent. The time\ntraveller traverses thirty years in one year; she is 51 years old 21\nyears after her birth; she dies at the age of 90, 200 years before her\nbirth; and so on. The objection is that these are straightforward\ncontradictions: the basic description of what time travel involves is\ninconsistent; therefore time travel is logically\nimpossible.[9] \n\nThere must be something wrong with this objection, because it would\nshow Einstein to be logically impossible—whereas this\nsort of future-directed time travel has actually been observed (albeit\non a much smaller scale—but that does not affect the present\npoint) (Hafele and Keating, 1972b,a). The most common response to the\nobjection is that there is no contradiction because the interval of\ntime traversed by the time traveller and the duration of her journey\nare measured with respect to different frames of reference: there is\nthus no reason why they should coincide. A similar point applies to\nthe discrepancy between the time elapsed since the time\ntraveller’s birth and her age upon arrival. There is no more of\na contradiction here than in the fact that Melbourne is both 800\nkilometres away from Sydney—along the main highway—and\n1200 kilometres away—along the coast\nroad.[10] Before leaving the question ‘What is time travel?’ we\nshould note the crucial distinction between changing the past and\nparticipating in (aka affecting or influencing) the\npast.[11] In the\npopular imagination, backwards time travel would allow one to change\nthe past: to right the wrongs of history, to prevent one’s\nyounger self doing things one later regretted, and so on. In a model\nwith a single past, however, this idea is incoherent: the very\ndescription of the case involves a contradiction (e.g. the time\ntraveller burns all her diaries at midnight on her fortieth birthday\nin 1976, and does not burn all her diaries at midnight on her fortieth\nbirthday in 1976). It is not as if there are two versions of the past:\nthe original one, without the time traveller present, and then a\nsecond version, with the time traveller playing a role. There is just\none past—and two perspectives on it: the perspective of\nthe younger self, and the perspective of the older time travelling\nself. If these perspectives are inconsistent (e.g. an event occurs in\none but not the other) then the time travel scenario is\nincoherent. \n\nThis means that time travellers can do less than we might have hoped:\nthey cannot right the wrongs of history; they cannot even stir a speck\nof dust on a certain day in the past if, on that day, the speck was in\nfact unmoved. But this does not mean that time travellers\nmust be entirely powerless in the past: while they cannot do anything\nthat did not actually happen, they can (in principle) do\nanything that did happen. Time travellers cannot change the\npast: they cannot make it different from the way it was—but they\ncan participate in it: they can be amongst the people who did make the\npast the way it\n was.[12] \n\nWhat about models involving two temporal dimensions, or parallel\nuniverses—do they allow for coherent scenarios in which the past\nis changed?[13] \nThere is certainly no contradiction in saying that the\ntime traveller burns all her diaries at midnight on her fortieth\nbirthday in 1976 in universe 1 (or at\nhypertime A), and does not burn all her diaries at\nmidnight on her fortieth birthday in 1976 in universe 2\n(or at hypertime B). The question is whether\nthis kind of story involves changing the past in the sense\noriginally envisaged: righting the wrongs of history, preventing\nsubsequently regretted actions, and so on. Goddu (2003) and van \nInwagen (2010) argue that it does (in the context of particular\nhypertime models), while Smith\n(1997, 365–6; 2015) argues that it does not: that it\ninvolves avoiding the past—leaving it untouched while\ntravelling to a different version of the past in which things proceed\ndifferently. The most important objection to the logical possibility of\nbackwards time travel is the so-called Grandfather paradox. This\nparadox has actually convinced many people that backwards time travel\nis impossible: The dead giveaway that true time-travel is flatly\nimpossible arises from the well-known “paradoxes” it\nentails. The classic example is “What if you go back into the\npast and kill your grandfather when he was still a little\nboy?”…So complex and hopeless are the\nparadoxes…that the easiest way out of the irrational chaos that\nresults is to suppose that true time-travel is, and forever will be,\nimpossible. (Asimov 1995 [2003, 276–7]) travel into one’s past…would seem to give rise to all\nsorts of logical problems, if you were able to change history. For\nexample, what would happen if you killed your parents before you were\nborn. It might be that one could avoid such paradoxes by some\nmodification of the concept of free will. But this will not be\nnecessary if what I call the chronology protection conjecture\nis correct: The laws of physics prevent closed timelike curves\nfrom appearing. (Hawking, 1992,\n604)[14] The paradox comes in different forms. Here’s one version: If time travel was logically possible then the time\ntraveller could return to the past and in a suicidal rage destroy his\ntime machine before it was completed and murder his younger self. But\nif this was so a necessary condition for the time trip to have\noccurred at all is removed, and we should then conclude that the time\ntrip did not occur. Hence if the time trip did occur, then it did not\noccur. Hence it did not occur, and it is necessary that it\ndid not occur. To reply, as it is standardly done, that our time\ntraveller cannot change the past in this way, is a petitio\nprincipii. Why is it that the time traveller is constrained in\nthis way? What mysterious force stills his sudden suicidal rage?\n(Smith, 1985, 58) The idea is that backwards time travel is impossible because if it\noccurred, time travellers would attempt to do things such as kill\ntheir younger selves (or their grandfathers etc.). We know that doing\nthese things—indeed, changing the past in any way—is\nimpossible. But were there time travel, there would then be nothing\nleft to stop these things happening. If we let things get to the stage\nwhere the time traveller is facing Grandfather with a loaded weapon,\nthen there is nothing left to prevent the impossible from\noccurring. So we must draw the line earlier: it must be impossible for\nsomeone to get into this situation at all; that is, backwards time\ntravel must be impossible. \n\nIn order to defend the possibility of time travel in the face of this\nargument we need to show that time travel is not a sure route to doing\nthe impossible. So, given that a time traveller has gone to the past\nand is facing Grandfather, what could stop her killing Grandfather?\nSome science fiction authors resort to the idea of chaperones or time\nguardians who prevent time travellers from changing the past—or\nto mysterious forces of logic. But it is hard to take these ideas\nseriously—and more importantly, it is hard to make them work in\ndetail when we remember that changing the past is impossible. (The\nchaperone is acting to ensure that the past remains as it\nwas—but the only reason it ever was that way is because of his\nvery\n actions.)[15] \n Fortunately there is a better\nresponse—also to be found in the science fiction literature, and\nbrought to the attention of philosophers by Lewis (1976). What would\nstop the time traveller doing the impossible? She would fail\n“for some commonplace reason”, as Lewis (1976, 150) puts\nit. Her gun might jam, a noise might distract her, she might slip on a\nbanana peel, etc. Nothing more than such ordinary occurrences is\nrequired to stop the time traveller killing Grandfather. Hence\nbackwards time travel does not entail the occurrence of impossible\nevents—and so the above objection is defused. A problem remains. Suppose Tim, a time-traveller, is facing his\ngrandfather with a loaded gun. Can Tim kill Grandfather? On the one\nhand, yes he can. He is an excellent shot; there is no chaperone to\nstop him; the laws of logic will not magically stay his hand; he hates\nGrandfather and will not hesitate to pull the trigger; etc. On the\nother hand, no he can’t. To kill Grandfather would be to change\nthe past, and no-one can do that (not to mention the fact that if\nGrandfather died, then Tim would not have been born). So we have a\ncontradiction: Tim can kill Grandfather and Tim cannot kill\nGrandfather. Time travel thus leads to a contradiction: so it is\nimpossible. \n\nNote the difference between this version of the Grandfather paradox\nand the version considered above. In the earlier version, the\ncontradiction happens if Tim kills Grandfather. The solution was to\nsay that Tim can go into the past without killing\nGrandfather—hence time travel does not entail a\ncontradiction. In the new version, the contradiction happens as soon\nas Tim gets to the past. Of course Tim does not kill\nGrandfather—but we still have a contradiction anyway: for he\nboth can do it, and cannot do it. As Lewis puts it: Could a time traveler change the past? It seems not:\nthe events of a past moment could no more change than numbers\ncould. Yet it seems that he would be as able as anyone to do things\nthat would change the past if he did them. If a time traveler visiting\nthe past both could and couldn’t do something that would change\nit, then there cannot possibly be such a time traveler. (Lewis, 1976,\n149) \n\nLewis’s own solution to this problem has been widely\naccepted.[16] It\nturns on the idea that to say that something can happen is to\nsay that its occurrence is compossible with certain facts, where\ncontext determines (more or less) which facts are the relevant\nones. Tim’s killing Grandfather in 1921 is compossible with the\nfacts about his weapon, training, state of mind, and so on. It is not\ncompossible with further facts, such as the fact that Grandfather did\nnot die in 1921. Thus ‘Tim can kill Grandfather’ is true\nin one sense (relative to one set of facts) and false in another sense\n(relative to another set of facts)—but there is no single sense\nin which it is both true and false. So there is no contradiction\nhere—merely an equivocation. \n\nAnother response is that of Vihvelin (1996), who argues that there is\nno contradiction here because ‘Tim can kill Grandfather’\nis simply false (i.e. contra Lewis, there is no legitimate sense in\nwhich it is true). According to Vihvelin, for ‘Tim can kill\nGrandfather’ to be true, there must be at least some occasions\non which ‘If Tim had tried to kill Grandfather, he would or at\nleast might have succeeded’ is true—but, Vihvelin argues,\nat any world remotely like ours, the latter counterfactual is always\nfalse.[17] Return to the original version of the Grandfather paradox and\nLewis’s ‘commonplace reasons’ response to it. This\nresponse engenders a new objection—due to Horwich\n(1987)—not to the possibility but to the probability of\nbackwards time travel. Think about correlated events in general. Whenever we see two things\nfrequently occurring together, this is because one of them causes the\nother, or some third thing causes both. Horwich calls this the\nPrinciple of V-Correlation: if events of type A and B are associated with one\nanother, then either there is always a chain of events between\nthem…or else we find an earlier event of type C that links up\nwith A and B by two such chains of events. What we do not see\nis…an inverse fork—in which A and B are connected only\nwith a characteristic subsequent event, but no preceding\none. (Horwich, 1987, 97–8) For example, suppose that two students turn up to class wearing the\nsame outfits. That could just be a coincidence (i.e. there is no\ncommon cause, and no direct causal link between the two events). If it\nhappens every week for the whole semester, it is possible\nthat it is a coincidence, but this is extremely\nunlikely. Normally, we see this sort of extensive correlation\nonly if either there is a common cause (e.g. both students have\nproduct endorsement deals with the same clothing company, or both\nslavishly copy the same fashion blog) or a direct causal link\n(e.g. one student is copying the other). \n\nNow consider the time traveller setting off to kill her younger\nself. As discussed, no contradiction need ensue—this is\nprevented not by chaperones or mysterious forces, but by a run of\nordinary occurrences in which the trigger falls off the time\ntraveller’s gun, a gust of wind pushes her bullet off course,\nshe slips on a banana peel, and so on. But now consider this run of\nordinary occurrences. Whenever the time traveller contemplates\nauto-infanticide, someone nearby will drop a banana peel ready for her\nto slip on, or a bird will begin to fly so that it will be in the path\nof the time traveller’s bullet by the time she fires, and so\non. In general, there will be a correlation between auto-infanticide\nattempts and foiling occurrences such as the presence of banana\npeels—and this correlation will be of the type that does not\ninvolve a direct causal connection between the correlated events or a\ncommon cause of both. But extensive correlations of this sort are, as\nwe saw, extremely rare—so backwards time travel will happen\nabout as often as you will see two people wear the same outfits to\nclass every day of semester, without there being any causal\nconnection between what one wears and what the other wears. \n\nWe can set out Horwich’s argument this way: The conclusion is not that time travel is impossible, but that we\nshould treat it the way we treat the possibility of, say, tossing a\nfair coin and getting heads one thousand times in a row. As Price\n(1996, 278 n.7) puts it—in the context of endorsing\nHorwich’s conclusion: “the hypothesis of time travel can\nbe made to imply propositions of arbitrarily low probability. This is\nnot a classical reductio, but it is as close as science ever\ngets.” \n\nSmith (1997) attacks both premisses of Horwich’s\nargument. Against the first premise, he argues that backwards time\ntravel, in itself, does not entail extensive uncaused\ncorrelations. Rather, when we look more closely, we see that time\ntravel scenarios involving extensive uncaused correlations always\nbuild in prior coincidences which are themselves highly\nunlikely. Against the second premise, he argues that, from the fact\nthat we have never seen extensive uncaused correlations, it does not\nfollow that we never shall. This is not inductive scepticism: let us\nassume (contra the inductive sceptic) that in the absence of any\nspecific reason for thinking things should be different in the future,\nwe are entitled to assume they will continue being the same; still we\ncannot dismiss a specific reason for thinking the future will\nbe a certain way simply on the basis that things have never\nbeen that way in the past. You might reassure an anxious friend that\nthe sun will certainly rise tomorrow because it always has in the\npast—but you cannot similarly refute an astronomer who claims to\nhave discovered a specific reason for thinking that the earth will\nstop rotating overnight. \n\nSider (2002, 119–20) endorses Smith’s second\nobjection. Dowe (2003) criticises Smith’s first objection, but\nagrees with the second, concluding overall that time travel has not\nbeen shown to be improbable. Ismael (2003) reaches a similar\nconclusion. Goddu (2007) criticises Smith’s first objection to\nHorwich. Further contributions to the debate include Arntzenius (2006)\nand Smeenk and Wüthrich (2011, §2.2). For a different\nargument to the same conclusion as Horwich’s—that time\ntravel is improbable—see Ney (2000). Return again to the original version of the Grandfather\nparadox and Lewis’s ‘commonplace\nreasons’ response to it.  This response engenders a\nfurther objection.  The autoinfanticidal time traveller is\nattempting to do something impossible (render herself permanently dead from\nan age younger than her age at the time of the attempts).  Suppose we\naccept that she will not succeed and that what will stop her is\na succession of commonplace occurrences.  The previous objection was that\nsuch a succession is improbable.  The new objection is that the\nexclusion of the time traveler from successfully committing\nauto-infanticide is mysteriously inexplicable.  The worry is as\nfollows.  Each particular event that foils the time traveller is explicable\nin a perfectly ordinary way; but the inevitable combination of these events\namounts to a ring-fencing of the forbidden zone of\nautoinfanticide—and this ring-fencing is\nmystifying.  It’s like a grand conspiracy to stop the time traveler from\ndoing what she wants to do—and yet there are no\nconspirators: no time lords, no magical forces of logic.  This is\nprofoundly perplexing.  Riggs (1997, 52) writes:\n“Lewis’s account may do for a once only attempt,\nbut is untenable as a general explanation of Tim’s continual lack\nof success if he keeps on trying.” Ismael (2003,\n308) writes: “Considered individually, there will\nbe nothing anomalous in the explanations…It is\nalmost irresistible to suppose, however, that there is something anomalous\nin the cases considered collectively, i.e., in our unfailing lack of\nsuccess.” See also Gorovitz (1964,\n366–7), Horwich (1987,\n119–21) and Carroll (2010, 86). There have been two different kinds of defense of time travel\nagainst the objection that it involves mysteriously inexplicable\noccurrences.  Baron and Colyvan (2016, 70) agree with the objectors\nthat a purely causal explanation of failure—e.g. Tim\nfails to kill Grandfather because first he slips on a banana peel,\nthen his gun jams, and so on—is insufficient.  However they\nargue that, in addition, Lewis offers a non-causal—a\nlogical—explanation of failure: “What explains\nTim’s failure to kill his grandfather, then, is something about logic;\nspecifically: Tim fails to kill his grandfather because the law of\nnon-contradiction holds.” Smith (2017) argues that the\nappearance of inexplicability is illusory.  There are no scenarios\nsatisfying the description ‘a time traveller commits\nautoinfanticide’ (or changes the past in any other way) because\nthe description is self-contradictory (e.g. it involves the time\ntraveller permanently dying at 20 and also being alive at 40).  So\nwhatever happens it will not be ‘that’.  There is\nliterally no way for the time traveller not to fail.  Hence there is\nno need for—or even possibility of—a substantive\nexplanation of why failure invariably occurs, and such failure is not\nperplexing. Backwards time travel scenarios give rise to interesting issues\nconcerning causation. In this section we examine two such issues. Earlier we distinguished changing the past and affecting the past,\nand argued that while the former is impossible, backwards time travel\nneed involve only the latter. Affecting the past would be an example\nof backwards causation (i.e. causation where the effect precedes its\ncause)—and it has been argued that this too is impossible, or at\nleast \n problematic.[18]\n The classic argument against backwards\ncausation is the bilking\n argument.[19] \nFaced with the claim that some event A causes an earlier\nevent B, the proponent of the bilking objection recommends an\nattempt to decorrelate A and B—that is, to bring\nabout A in cases in which B has not occurred, and to\nprevent A in cases in which B has occurred. If the\nattempt is successful, then B often occurs despite the\nsubsequent nonoccurrence of A, and A often occurs\nwithout B occurring, and so A cannot be the cause\nof B. If, on the other hand, the attempt is\nunsuccessful—if, that is, A cannot be prevented\nwhen B has occurred, nor brought about when B has not\noccurred—then, it is argued, it must be B that is the\ncause of A, rather than vice versa. \n\nThe bilking procedure requires repeated manipulation of\nevent A. Thus, it cannot get under way in cases in\nwhich A is either unrepeatable or unmanipulable. Furthermore,\nthe procedure requires us to know whether or not B has\noccurred, prior to manipulating A—and thus, it cannot get\nunder way in cases in which it cannot be known whether or not B\nhas occurred until after the occurrence or nonoccurrence of A\n(Dummett, 1964). These three loopholes allow room for many claims of\nbackwards causation that cannot be touched by the bilking argument,\nbecause the bilking procedure cannot be performed at all. But what\nabout those cases in which it can be performed? If the procedure\nsucceeds—that is, A and B are\ndecorrelated—then the claim that A causes B is\nrefuted, or at least weakened (depending upon the details of the\ncase). But if the bilking attempt fails, it does not follow that it\nmust be B that is the cause of A, rather than vice\nversa. Depending upon the situation, that B causes A\nmight become a viable alternative to the hypothesis that A\ncauses B—but there is no reason to think that this\nalternative must always be the superior one. For example, suppose that\nI see a photo of you in a paper dated well before your birth,\naccompanied by a report of your arrival from the future. I now try to\nbilk your upcoming time trip—but I slip on a banana peel while\nrushing to push you away from your time machine, my time travel horror\nstories only inspire you further, and so on. Or again, suppose that I\nknow that you were not in Sydney yesterday. I now try to get you to go\nthere in your time machine—but first I am struck by lightning,\nthen I fall down a manhole, and so on. What does all this prove?\nSurely not that your arrival in the past causes your departure from\nthe future. Depending upon the details of the case, it seems that we\nmight well be entitled to describe it as involving backwards time\ntravel and backwards causation. At least, if we are not so entitled,\nthis must be because of other facts about the case: it would not\nfollow simply from the repeated coincidental failures of my bilking\nattempts. Backwards time travel would apparently allow for the possibility of\ncausal loops, in which things come from nowhere. The things in\nquestion might be objects—imagine a time traveller who steals a\ntime machine from the local museum in order to make his time trip and\nthen donates the time machine to the same museum at the end of the\ntrip (i.e. in the past). In this case the machine itself is never\nbuilt by anyone—it simply exists. The things in question might\nbe information—imagine a time traveller who explains the theory\nbehind time travel to her younger self: theory that she herself knows\nonly because it was explained to her in her youth by her time\ntravelling older self. The things in question might be\nactions. Imagine a time traveller who visits his younger self. When he\nencounters his younger self, he suddenly has a vivid memory of being\npunched on the nose by a strange visitor. He realises that this is\nthat very encounter—and resignedly proceeds to punch his younger\nself. Why did he do it? Because he knew that it would happen and so\nfelt that he had to do it—but he only knew it would happen\nbecause he in fact did\n it.[20] \n\nOne might think that causal loops are impossible—and hence that\ninsofar as backwards time travel entails such loops, it too is\nimpossible.[21]\nThere are two issues to consider here. First, does backwards time\ntravel entail causal loops? Lewis (1976, 148) raises the question\nwhether there must be causal loops whenever there is backwards\ncausation; in response to the question, he says simply “I am not\nsure.” Mellor (1998, 131) appears to claim a positive answer to\nthe question.[22]\n Hanley (2004, 130) defends a negative\nanswer by telling a time travel story in which there is backwards time\ntravel and backwards causation, but no causal\nloops.[23]\nMonton (2009) criticises Hanley’s counterexample, but also\ndefends a negative answer via different counterexamples. \n\nSecond, are causal loops impossible, or in some other way\nobjectionable? One objection is that causal loops\nare inexplicable. There have been two main kinds of response\nto this objection. One is to agree but deny that this is a\nproblem. Lewis (1976, 149) accepts that a loop (as a whole) would be\ninexplicable—but thinks that this inexplicability (like that of\nthe Big Bang or the decay of a tritium atom) is merely strange, not\nimpossible. In a similar vein, Meyer (2012, 263) argues that if\nsomeone asked for an explanation of a loop (as a whole), “the\nblame would fall on the person asking the question, not on our\ninability to answer it.” The second kind of response (Hanley,\n2004, §5) is to deny that (all) causal loops are inexplicable. A\nsecond objection to causal loops, due to Mellor (1998, ch.12), is that\nin such loops the chances of events would fail to be related to their\nfrequencies in accordance with the law of large numbers. Berkovitz\n(2001) and Dowe (2001) both argue that Mellor’s objection fails\nto establish the impossibility of causal\nloops.[24] Gödel (1949 [1990a])—in which Gödel presents\nmodels of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity in which there\nexist CTC’s—can well be regarded as initiating the modern\nacademic literature on time travel, in both philosophy and physics. In\na companion paper, Gödel discusses the significance of his\nresults for more general issues in the philosophy of time (Gödel\n1949a [1990b]). For the following half century, the time travel\nliterature focussed predominantly on objections to the possibility (or\nprobability) of time travel. More recently, however, there has been\nrenewed interest in the connections between time travel and more\ngeneral issues in the metaphysics of time and change. We examine some\nof these in the present\n section.[25] \n\nThe first thing that we need to do is set up the various metaphysical\npositions whose relationships with time travel will then be\ndiscussed. Consider two metaphysical questions: We can label some views on the first question as\nfollows. Eternalism is the view that past and future times,\nobjects and events are just as real as the present time and present\nevents and objects. Nowism is the view that only the present\ntime and present events and objects exist. Now-and-then-ism\nis the view that the past and present exist but the future does\nnot. We can also label some views on the second\nquestion. The A-theory answers in the affirmative: the flow\nof time and division of events into past (before now), present (now)\nand future (after now) are objective features of reality (as opposed\nto mere features of our experience). Furthermore, they are linked: the\nobjective flow of time arises from the movement, through time, of the\nobjective now (from the past towards the\nfuture). The B-theory answers in the negative: while we\ncertainly experience now as special, and time as flowing, the B-theory\ndenies that what is going on here is that we are detecting objective\nfeatures of reality in a way that corresponds transparently to how\nthose features are in themselves. The flow of time and the now are not\nobjective features of reality; they are merely features of our\nexperience. By combining answers to our first and second questions we\narrive at positions on the metaphysics of time such\nas:[26] \n\nSo much for positions on time itself. Now for some views on temporal\nobjects: objects that exist in (and, in general, change over)\ntime. Three-dimensionalism is the view that persons, tables\nand other temporal objects are three-dimensional entities. On this\nview, what you see in the mirror is a whole\nperson.[27]\nTomorrow, when you look again, you will see the whole person again. On\nthis view, persons and other temporal objects are wholly\npresent at every time at which they\nexist. Four-dimensionalism is the view that persons, tables\nand other temporal objects are four-dimensional entities, extending\nthrough three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. On this\nview, what you see in the mirror is not a whole person: it is just a\nthree-dimensional temporal part of a person. Tomorrow, when you look\nagain, you will see a different such temporal part. Say that an\nobject persists through time if it is around at some time and\nstill around at a later time. Three- and four-dimensionalists agree\nthat (some) objects persist, but they differ over how objects\npersist. According to three-dimensionalists, objects persist\nby enduring: an object persists from t1\nto t2 by being wholly present\nat t1 and t2 and every instant in\nbetween. According to four-dimensionalists, objects persist\nby perduring: an object persists from t1\nto t2 by having temporal parts\nat t1 and t2 and every instant in\nbetween. Perduring can be usefully compared with being extended in\nspace: a road extends from Melbourne to Sydney not by being wholly\nlocated at every point in between, but by having a spatial part at\nevery point in between. \n\nIt is natural to combine three-dimensionalism with presentism and\nfour-dimensionalism with the block universe view—but other\ncombinations of views are certainly possible. Gödel (1949a [1990b]) argues from the possibility of time\ntravel (more precisely, from the existence of solutions to the field\nequations of General Relativity in which there exist CTC’s) to\nthe B-theory: that is, to the conclusion that there is no objective\nflow or passage of time and no objective now. Gödel begins by\nreviewing an argument from Special Relativity to the B-theory: because\nthe notion of simultaneity becomes a relative one in Special\nRelativity, there is no room for the idea of an objective succession\nof “nows”. He then notes that this argument is disrupted\nin the context of General Relativity, because in models of the latter\ntheory to date, the presence of matter does allow recovery of an\nobjectively distinguished series of “nows”. Gödel\nthen proposes a new model (Gödel 1949 [1990a]) in which no such\nrecovery is possible. (This is the model that contains CTC’s.)\nFinally, he addresses the issue of how one can infer anything about\nthe nonexistence of an objective flow of time in our universe\nfrom the existence of a merely possible universe in which\nthere is no objectively distinguished series of\n“nows”. His main response is that while it would not be\nstraightforwardly contradictory to suppose that the existence of an\nobjective flow of time depends on the particular, contingent\narrangement and motion of matter in the world, this would nevertheless\nbe unsatisfactory. Responses to Gödel have been of two main\nkinds. Some have objected to the claim that there is no objective flow\nof time in his model universe (e.g. Savitt (2005); see also Savitt\n(1994)). Others have objected to the attempt to transfer conclusions\nabout that model universe to our own universe (e.g. Earman (1995,\n197–200); for a partial response to Earman see Belot (2005,\n§3.4)).[28] \n\nEarlier we posed two questions: Gödel’s argument is related to the second\nquestion. Let’s turn now to the first question. Godfrey-Smith\n(1980, 72) writes “The metaphysical picture which underlies time\ntravel talk is that of the block universe [i.e. eternalism, in the\nterminology of the present entry], in which the world is conceived as\nextended in time as it is in space.” In his report on\nthe Analysis problem to which Godfrey-Smith’s paper is\na response, Harrison (1980, 67) replies that he would like an argument\nin support of this assertion. Here is an\nargument:[29] A fundamental requirement for the possibility of time\ntravel is the existence of the destination of the journey. That is, a\njourney into the past or the future would have to presuppose that the\npast or future were somehow real. (Grey, 1999, 56) Dowe (2000, 442–5) responds that the destination does not\nhave to exist at the time of departure: it only has to exist at the\ntime of arrival—and this is quite compatible with non-eternalist\nviews. And Keller and Nelson (2001, 338) argue that time travel is\ncompatible with presentism: There is four-dimensional [i.e. eternalist, in the\nterminology of the present entry] time-travel if the appropriate sorts\nof events occur at the appropriate sorts of times; events like people\nhopping into time-machines and disappearing, people reappearing with\nthe right sorts of memories, and so on. But the presentist can have\njust the same patterns of events happening at just the same times. Or\nat least, it can be the case on the presentist model that the right\nsorts of events will happen, or did happen, or are happening, at the\nrights sorts of times. If it suffices for four-dimensionalist\ntime-travel that Jennifer disappears in 2054 and appears in 1985 with\nthe right sorts of memories, then why shouldn’t it suffice for\npresentist time-travel that Jennifer will disappear in 2054, and that\nshe did appear in 1985 with the right sorts of memories? Sider (2005) responds that there is still a problem reconciling\npresentism with time travel conceived in Lewis’s way: that\nconception of time travel requires that personal time is similar to\nexternal time—but presentists have trouble allowing\nthis. Further contributions to the debate whether presentism—and\nother versions of the A-theory—are compatible with time travel\ninclude Monton (2003), Daniels (2012) and Hall (2014) on the side of compatibility,\nand Miller (2005), Slater (2005), Miller (2008) and Hales (2010) on\nthe side of incompatibility. Leibniz’s Law says that if x = y (i.e. x\nand y are identical—one and the same entity)\nthen x and y have exactly the same properties. There is\na superficial conflict between this principle of logic and the fact\nthat things change. If Bill is at one time thin and at another time\nnot so—and yet it is the very same person both times—it\nlooks as though the very same entity (Bill) both possesses and fails\nto possess the property of being thin. Three-dimensionalists and\nfour-dimensionalists respond to this problem in different\nways. According to the four-dimensionalist, what is thin is not Bill\n(who is a four-dimensional entity) but certain temporal parts of Bill;\nand what is not thin are other temporal parts of Bill. So\nthere is no single entity that both possesses and fails to possess the\nproperty of being thin. Three-dimensionalists have several\noptions. One is to deny that there are such properties as\n‘thin’ (simpliciter): there are only temporally\nrelativised properties such as ‘thin at time t’. In\nthat case, while Bill at t1 and Bill\nat t2 are the very same entity—Bill is wholly\npresent at each time—there is no single property that this one\nentity both possesses and fails to possess: Bill possesses the\nproperty ‘thin at t1’ and lacks the\nproperty ‘thin at\n t2’.[30] \n\nNow consider the case of a time traveller Ben who encounters his\nyounger self at time t. Suppose that the younger self is thin\nand the older self not so. The four-dimensionalist can accommodate\nthis scenario easily. Just as before, what we have are two different\nthree-dimensional parts of the same four-dimensional entity, one of\nwhich possesses the property ‘thin’ and the other of which\ndoes not. The three-dimensionalist, however, faces a problem. Even if\nwe relativise properties to times, we still get the contradiction that\nBen possesses the property ‘thin at t’ and also\nlacks that very same \nproperty.[31]\n There are several possible options for\nthe three-dimensionalist here. One is to relativise properties not to\nexternal times but to personal times (Horwich, 1975, 434–5);\nanother is to relativise properties to spatial locations as well as to\ntimes (or simply to spacetime points). Sider (2001, 101–6)\ncriticises both options (and others besides), concluding that time\ntravel is incompatible with three-dimensionalism. Markosian (2004)\nresponds to Sider’s \nargument;[32]\n Miller (2006) also responds to Sider and\nargues for the compatibility of time travel and endurantism; Gilmore\n(2007) seeks to weaken the case against endurantism by constructing\nanalogous arguments against perdurantism. Simon (2005) finds problems\nwith Sider’s arguments, but presents different arguments for the\nsame conclusion; Effingham and Robson (2007) and Benovsky (2011) also\noffer new arguments for this \nconclusion.[33] We have seen arguments to the conclusions that time travel is impossible,\nimprobable and inexplicable. Here’s\nan argument to the conclusion that backwards time travel simply will\nnot occur. If backwards time travel is ever going to occur,\nwe would already have seen the time travellers—but we have seen\nnone such.[34]\nThe argument is a weak \n one.[35]\n For a start, it is perhaps not beyond\nreasonable doubt that time travellers have indeed visited the\n Earth[36]—but\n even granting that they have\nnot, this is still compatible with the future actuality of backwards\ntime travel. First, it may be that time travel is very expensive,\ndifficult or dangerous—or for some other reason quite\nrare—and that by the time it is available, our present period of\nhistory is insufficiently high on the list of interesting\ndestinations. Second, it may be—and indeed existing proposals in\nthe physics literature have this feature—that backwards time\ntravel works by creating a CTC that lies entirely in the future: in\nthis case, backwards time travel becomes possible after the creation\nof the CTC, but travel to a time earlier than the time at which the\nCTC is created is not\n possible.[37]","contact.mail":"nicholas.smith@sydney.edu.au","contact.domain":"sydney.edu.au"}]
