He spent his early\nyears on the island of Samos, off the coast of modern Turkey. At the\nage of forty, however, he emigrated to the city of Croton in southern\nItaly and most of his philosophical activity occurred\nthere. Pythagoras wrote nothing, nor were there any detailed accounts\nof his thought written by contemporaries. By the first centuries BCE,\nmoreover, it became fashionable to present Pythagoras in a largely\nunhistorical fashion as a semi-divine figure, who originated all that\nwas true in the Greek philosophical tradition, including many of\nPlato’s and Aristotle’s mature ideas. A number of treatises were\nforged in the name of Pythagoras and other Pythagoreans in order to\nsupport this view.\n\n\n  The Pythagorean question, then, is how to get behind this false\nglorification of Pythagoras in order to determine what the historical\nPythagoras actually thought and did. In order to obtain an accurate\nappreciation of Pythagoras’ achievement, it is important to rely on\nthe earliest evidence before the distortions of the later tradition\narose. The popular modern image of Pythagoras is that of a master\nmathematician and scientist. The early evidence shows, however, that,\nwhile Pythagoras was famous in his own day and even 150 years later in\nthe time of Plato and Aristotle, it was not mathematics or science\nupon which his fame rested. Pythagoras was famous (1) as an expert on\nthe fate of the soul after death, who thought that the soul was\nimmortal and went through a series of reincarnations; (2) as an expert\non religious ritual; (3) as a wonder-worker who had a thigh of gold\nand who could be two places at the same time; (4) as the founder of a\nstrict way of life that emphasized dietary restrictions, religious\nritual and rigorous self discipline. \n\n\n It remains controversial whether he also engaged in the rational\ncosmology that is typical of the Presocratic philosopher/scientists\nand whether he was in any sense a mathematician. The early evidence\nsuggests, however, that Pythagoras presented a cosmos that was\nstructured according to moral principles and significant numerical\nrelationships and may have been akin to conceptions of the cosmos\nfound in Platonic myths, such as those at the end of the\nPhaedo and Republic. In such a cosmos, the planets\nwere seen as instruments of divine vengeance (“the hounds of\nPersephone”), the sun and moon are the isles of the blessed\nwhere we may go, if we live a good life, while thunder functioned to\nfrighten the souls being punished in Tartarus. The heavenly bodies\nalso appear to have moved in accordance with the mathematical ratios\nthat govern the concordant musical intervals in order to produce a\nmusic of the heavens, which in the later tradition developed into\n“the harmony of the spheres.” It is doubtful that\nPythagoras himself thought in terms of spheres, and the mathematics of\nthe movements of the heavens was not worked out in detail.  There is\nevidence that he valued relationships between numbers such as those\nembodied in the so-called Pythagorean theorem, though it is not likely\nthat he proved the theorem. In recent scholarship this consensus view\nhas received strong challenges, which will be discussed below.\n\n\n  Pythagoras’ cosmos was developed in a more scientific and\nmathematical direction by his successors in the Pythagorean tradition,\nPhilolaus and Archytas. Pythagoras succeeded in promulgating a new\nmore optimistic view of the fate of the soul after death and in\nfounding a way of life that was attractive for its rigor and\ndiscipline and that drew to him numerous devoted followers.\n\n\n\nWhat were the beliefs and practices of the historical Pythagoras?\nThis apparently simple question has become the daunting Pythagorean\nquestion for several reasons. First, Pythagoras himself wrote nothing,\nso our knowledge of Pythagoras’ views is entirely derived from the\nreports of others. Second, there was no extensive or authoritative\ncontemporary account of Pythagoras. No one did for Pythagoras what\nPlato and Xenophon did for Socrates. Third, only fragments of the\nfirst detailed accounts of Pythagoras, written about 150 years after\nhis death, have survived. Fourth, it is clear that these accounts\ndisagreed with one another on significant points. These four points\nwould already make the problem of determining Pythagoras’ philosophical\nbeliefs more difficult than determining those of almost any other\nancient philosopher, but a fifth factor complicates matters even\nmore. By the third century CE, when the first detailed accounts of\nPythagoras that survive intact were written, Pythagoras had come to be\nregarded, in some circles, as the master philosopher, from whom all\nthat was true in the Greek philosophical tradition derived. By the end\nof the first century BCE, a large collection of books had been forged\nin the name of Pythagoras and other early Pythagoreans, which\npurported to be the original Pythagorean texts from which Plato and\nAristotle derived their most important ideas. A treatise forged in the\nname of Timaeus of Locri was the supposed model for Plato’s\nTimaeus, just as forged treatises assigned to Archytas were\nthe supposed model for Aristotle’s Categories. Pythagoras\nhimself was widely presented as having anticipated Plato’s later\nmetaphysics, in which the one and the indefinite dyad are first\nprinciples. Thus, not only is the earliest evidence for\nPythagoras’ views meager and contradictory, it is overshadowed by the\nhagiographical presentation of Pythagoras, which became dominant in\nlate antiquity. Given these circumstances, the only reliable approach\nto answering the Pythagorean question is to start with the earliest\nevidence, which is independent of the later attempts to glorify\nPythagoras, and to use the picture of Pythagoras which emerges from\nthis early evidence as the standard against which to evaluate what can\nbe accepted and what must be rejected in the later\ntradition. Following such an approach, Walter Burkert, in his\nepoch-making book (1972a), revolutionized our understanding of the\nPythagorean question, and all modern scholarship on Pythagoras,\nincluding this article, stands on his shoulders. For a detailed\ndiscussion of the source problems that generate the Pythagorean\nQuestion see 2. Sources, below. \n\nThe problems regarding the sources for the life and philosophy of\nPythagoras are quite complicated, but it is impossible to understand\nthe Pythagorean Question without an accurate appreciation of at least\nthe general nature of these problems. It is best to start with the\nextensive but problematic later evidence and work back to the earlier\nreliable evidence. The most detailed, extended and hence most\ninfluential accounts of Pythagoras’ life and thought date to the third\ncentury CE, some 800 years after he died. Diogenes Laertius\n(ca. 200–250 CE) and Porphyry (ca. 234–305 CE) each wrote\na Life of Pythagoras, while Iamblichus (ca. 245–325 CE)\nwrote On the Pythagorean Life, which includes some biography\nbut focuses more on the way of life established by Pythagoras for his\nfollowers. All of these works were written at a time when Pythagoras’\nachievements had become considerably exaggerated. Diogenes may have\nsome claim to objectivity, but both Iamblichus and Porphyry have\nstrong agendas that have little to do with historical\naccuracy. Iamblichus presents Pythagoras as a soul sent from the gods\nto enlighten mankind (O’Meara 1989, 35–40).  Iamblichus’ work\nwas just the first in a ten volume work, which in effect\nPythagoreanized Neoplatonism, but the Pythagoreanism involved was\nIamblichus’ own conception of Pythagoras as particularly concerned\nwith mathematics rather than an account of Pythagoreanism based on the\nearliest evidence. Porphyry also emphasizes Pythagoras’ divine aspects\nand may be setting him up as a rival to Jesus (Iamblichus 1991,\n14). These three third-century accounts of Pythagoras were in turn\nbased on earlier sources, which are now lost. Some of these earlier\nsources were heavily contaminated by the Neopythagorean view of\nPythagoras as the source of all true philosophy, whose ideas Plato,\nAristotle and all later Greek philosophers plagiarized.  Iamblichus\ncites biographies of Pythagoras by Nicomachus of Gerasa and a certain\nApollonius (VP 251 and 254) and appears to have used them\nextensively even where they are not cited (Burkert 1972a, 98\nff.). Nicomachus (ca. 50–ca.150 CE) assigns Pythagoras a\nmetaphysics that is patently Platonic and Aristotelian and that\nemploys distinctive Platonic and Aristotelian terminology\n(Introduction to Arithmetic I.1). If the Apollonius cited by\nIamblichus is Apollonius of Tyana (1st CE), his account will be\ninfluenced by his veneration of Pythagoras as the model for his\nascetic life, but some scholars argue that Iamblichus is using an\notherwise unknown Apollonius (Flinterman 2014, 357). Porphyry\n(VP 48–53) explicitly cites Moderatus of Gades as one\nof his sources. Moderatus was an “aggressive”\nNeopythagorean of the first century CE, who reports that Plato,\nAristotle, and their pupils Speusippus, Aristoxenus and Xenocrates\ntook for their own everything that was fruitful in Pythagoreanism,\nleaving only what was superficial and trivial to be ascribed to the\nschool (Dillon 1977, 346). Diogenes Laertius, who appears to have less\npersonal allegiance to the Pythagorean legend, bases his primary\naccount of Pythagoras’ philosophy (VIII. 24–33) on\nthe Pythagorean Memoirs excerpted by Alexander Polyhistor,\nwhich are a forgery dating sometime around 200 BCE and which assign\nnot just Platonic but also Stoic ideas to Pythagoras (Burkert 1972a,\n53; Kahn 2001, 79–83). \n\nIn the Pythagorean Memoirs, Pythagoras is said to have\nadopted the Monad and the Indefinite Dyad as incorporeal principles,\nfrom which arise first the numbers, then plane and solid figures and\nfinally the bodies of the sensible world (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 25).\nThis is the philosophical system that is most commonly ascribed to\nPythagoras in the post-Aristotelian tradition, and it is found in\nSextus Empiricus’ (2nd century CE) detailed accounts of Pythagoreanism\n(e.g., M. X. 261) and most significantly in the influential\nhandbook of the differing opinions of the Greek philosophers, which\nwas compiled by Aetius in the first century CE and is based on\nthe Tenets of the Natural Philosophers of Aristotle’s pupil\nTheophrastus (e.g., H. Diels, Doxographi Graeci I. 3.8). The\ntestimony of Aristotle makes completely clear, however, that this was\nthe philosophical system of Plato in his later years and not that of\nPythagoras or even the later Pythagoreans. Aristotle is explicit that,\nalthough Plato’s system has similarities to the earlier Pythagorean\nphilosophy of limiters and unlimiteds, the indefinite dyad is unique\nto Plato (Metaphysics 987b26 ff.) and the Pythagoreans\nrecognized only the sensible world and hence did not derive it from\nimmaterial principles. In the Philebus, Plato himself tells a\nstory that is very much in agreement with Aristotle’s report. While\nacknowledging a debt to the philosophy of limiters and unlimiteds,\nwhich is found in Aristotle’s accounts of Pythagoreanism and in the\nfragments of the fifth-century Pythagorean Philolaus, Plato makes\nclear that this is a considerably earlier philosophy, which he is\ncompletely reworking for his own purposes (16c ff.; see Huffman 1999a\nand 2001). How are we to explain the later tradition’s divergence from\nthis testimony of Aristotle and Plato? The most convincing suggestion\npoints to evidence that, for reasons which are not entirely clear,\nPlato’s successors in the Academy, Speusippus, Xenocrates and\nHeraclides, chose to present Pythagoreanism not just as a precursor of\nlate Platonic metaphysics but as having anticipated its central\ntheses.  Thus the tradition which falsely ascribes Plato’s late\nmetaphysics to Pythagoras begins not with the Neopythagoreans in the\nfirst centuries BCE and CE but already in the fourth century BCE among\nPlato’s own pupils (Burkert 1972a, 53–83; Dillon 2003,\n61–62 and 153–154). This view of Pythagoreanism finds its\nway into the doxography of Aetius either because Theophrastus followed\nthe early Academy rather than his teacher Aristotle (Burkert 1972a,\n66) or because the Theophrastan doxography on Pythagoras was rewritten\nin the first century BCE under the influence of Neopythagoreanism\n(Diels 1958, 181; Zhmud 2012a, 455). Aristotle’s careful distinctions\nbetween Plato and fifth-century Pythagoreanism, which make excellent\nsense in terms of the general development of Greek philosophy, are\nlargely ignored in the later tradition in favor of the more\nsensational ascription of mature Platonism to Pythagoras. The evidence\nfor the early Academy is, however, very limited and some reject the\nthesis that its members assigned late Platonic metaphysics to\nPythagoras (Zhmud 2012, 415–432). The key text is found in\nProclus’ Commentary on the Parmenides (pp. 38.32–40.7\nKlibansky). Proclus quotes a passage in which Speusippus assigns to\nthe ancients, who in this context are the Pythagoreans, the One and\nthe Indefinite Dyad. Some scholars argue that this is not a genuine\nfragment of Speusippus but rather a later fabrication (see Zhmud\n2012a, 424–425 and for a response Dillon 2014, 251). If the Academy\ndid not assign the One and the Dyad to Pythagoras, however, it becomes\nless clear how these principles came to be assigned to\nhim. Theophrastus assigns them to the Pythagoreans\n(Metaphysics 11a27), but since Aristotle distinguishes the\nPythagoreans from Plato on this point, Zhmud’s suggestion (2012a, 455)\nthat he is following his teacher and just taking “the next step” does\nnot work. Theophrastus’ evidence makes best sense if we accept the\ntraditional view and suppose that it is on the authority of Plato’s\nsuccessors in the Academy that he bases his departure from his\nteacher’s, Aristotle’s, view. \n\nIf we step back for a minute and compare the sources for Pythagoras\nwith those available for other early Greek philosophers, the extent of\nthe difficulties inherent in the Pythagorean Question becomes clear.\nWhen trying to reconstruct the philosophy of Heraclitus, for example,\nmodern scholars rely above all on the actual quotations from\nHeraclitus’ book preserved in later authors. Since Pythagoras wrote no\nbooks, this most fundamental of all sources is denied us. In dealing\nwith Heraclitus, the modern scholar turns with reluctance next to the\ndoxographical tradition, the tradition represented by Aetius in the\nfirst century CE, which preserves in handbook form a systematic\naccount of the beliefs of the Greek philosophers on a series of topics\nhaving to do with the physical world and its first principles. Aetius’\nwork has been reconstructed by Hermann Diels on the basis of two later\nworks, which were derived from it, the\nSelections of Stobaeus (5th century CE) and the Opinions\nof Philosophers by pseudo-Plutarch (2nd century CE). Scholars’\nfaith in this evidence is largely based on the assumption that most of\nit goes back to Aristotle’s school and in particular to\nTheophrastus’ Tenets of the Natural Philosophers. Here again\nthe case of Pythagoras is exceptional.  Pythagoras is represented in\nthis tradition but, as we have seen, Theophrastus in this case either\nadopted the view that, against all historical plausibility, assigns\nPlato’s later metaphysics to Pythagoras or Theophrastus’ doxography on\nthe Pythagoreans was rewritten in the first century BCE. Thus, the\nsecond standard source for evidence for early Greek philosophy is, in\nthe case of Pythagoras, corrupted. Whatever views Pythagoras might\nhave had are replaced by late Platonic metaphysics in the\ndoxographical tradition. \n\nA third source of evidence for early Greek philosophy is regarded with\ngreat skepticism by most scholars and, in the case of most early Greek\nphilosophers, used only with great caution. This is the biographical\ntradition represented by the Lives of the Philosophers\nwritten by Diogenes Laertius. In this case we at first sight appear to\nbe in luck, at least with regard to the amount of evidence for\nPythagoras, since, as we have seen, two major accounts of the life of\nPythagoras and the Pythagorean way of life survive in addition to\nDiogenes’ life. Unfortunately, these two additional lives are written\nby authors (Iamblichus and Porphyry) whose goal is explicitly\nnon-historical, and all three of the lives rely heavily on authors in\nthe Neopythagorean tradition, whose goal was to show that all later\nGreek philosophy, insofar as it was true, had been stolen from\nPythagoras. There are, however, some sections in these three lives\nthat derive from sources that go back beyond the distorting influence\nof Neopythagoreanism, to sources in the fourth-century BCE, sources\nwhich are also independent of the early Academy’s attempt to assign\nPlatonic metaphysics to the Pythagoreans. The most important of these\nsources are the fragments of Aristotle’s lost treatises on the\nPythagoreans and the fragments of works on Pythagoreanism or of works\nwhich dealt in passing with Pythagoreanism written by Aristotle’s\npupils Dicaearchus and Aristoxenus, in the second half of the fourth\ncentury BCE. The historian Timaeus of Tauromenium (ca. 350–260\nBCE), who wrote a history of Sicily, which included material on\nsouthern Italy where Pythagoras was active, is also important. In some\ncases, the fragments of these early works are clearly identified in\nthe later lives, but in other cases we may suspect that they are the\nsource of a given passage without being able to be certain. Large\nproblems remain even in the case of these sources. They were all\nwritten 150–250 years after the death of Pythagoras; given the\nlack of written evidence for Pythagoras, they are based largely on\noral traditions. Aristoxenus, who grew up in the southern Italian town\nof Tarentum, where the Pythagorean Archytas was the dominant political\nfigure, and who was himself a Pythagorean before joining Aristotle’s\nschool, undoubtedly had a rich set of oral traditions upon which to\ndraw. It is clear, nonetheless, that 150 years after his death\nconflicting traditions regarding Pythagoras’ beliefs had arisen on\neven the most central issues. Thus, Aristoxenus is emphatic that\nPythagoras was not a strict vegetarian and ate a number of types of\nmeat (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 20), whereas Aristoxenus’ contemporary,\nthe mathematician Eudoxus, portrays him not only as avoiding all meat\nbut as even refusing to associate with butchers (Porphyry, VP\n7). Even among fourth-century authors that had at least some\npretensions to historical accuracy and who had access to the best\ninformation available, there are widely divergent presentations,\nsimply because such contradictions were endemic to the evidence\navailable in the fourth century. What we can hope to obtain from the\nevidence presented by Aristotle, Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, and Timaeus\nis thus not a picture of Pythagoras that is consistent in all respects\nbut rather a picture that at least defines the main areas of his\nachievement. This picture can then be tested by the most fundamental\nevidence of all, the testimony of authors that precede even Aristotle,\ntestimony in some cases that derives from Pythagoras’ own\ncontemporaries. This testimony is extremely limited, about twenty\nbrief references, but this dearth of evidence is not unique to\nPythagoras.  The pre-Aristotelian testimony for Pythagoras is more\nextensive than for most other early Greek philosophers and is thus\ntestimony to his fame. \n\nIn reconstructing the thought of early Greek philosophers, scholars\noften turn to Aristotle’s and Plato’s accounts of their predecessors,\nalthough Plato’s accounts are embedded in the literary structure of\nhis dialogues and thus do not pretend to historical accuracy, while\nAristotle’s apparently more historical presentation masks a\nconsiderable amount of reinterpretation of his predecessors’ views in\nterms of his own thought. In the case of Pythagoras, what is striking\nis the essential agreement of Plato and Aristotle in their\npresentation of his significance. Aristotle frequently discusses the\nphilosophy of Pythagoreans, whom he dates to the middle and second\nhalf of the fifth century and who posited limiters and unlimiteds as\nfirst principles. He sometimes refers to these Pythagoreans as the\n“so-called Pythagoreans,” suggesting that he had some\nreservations about the application of the label\n“Pythagorean” to them. Aristotle strikingly may never\nrefer to Pythagoras himself in his extant writings\n(Metaph. 986a29 is probably an interpolation; Rh.\n1398b14 is a quotation from Alcidamas; MM 1182a11 may not be\nby Aristotle and, if it is, may well be a case where\n“Pythagoreans” have been turned into\n“Pythagoras” in the transmission). In the fragments of his\nnow lost two-book treatise on the Pythagoreans, Aristotle does discuss\nPythagoras himself, but the references are all to Pythagoras as a\nfounder of a way of life, who forbade the eating of beans (Fr. 195),\nand to Pythagoras as a wonder-worker, who had a golden thigh and bit a\nsnake to death (Fr. 191). Zhmud (2012a, 259–260) argues that in one\nplace Aristotle also describes Pythagoras as a mathematician (Fr. 191)\nand in another as studying nature (Protrepticus Fr. 20) but in neither\ncase are the words likely to belong to Aristotle (see Huffman 2014b,\n281, n.7). If Aristotle only found evidence for Pythagoras as a\nwonder-worker and founder of a way of life, it becomes clear why he\nnever mentions Pythagoras in his account of his philosophical\npredecessors and why he uses the expression “so-called\nPythagoreans” to refer to the Pythagoreanism of the\nfifth-century. For Aristotle Pythagoras did not belong to the\nsuccession of thinkers starting with Thales, who were attempting to\nexplain the basic principles of the natural world, and hence he could\nnot see what sense it made to call a fifth-century thinker like\nPhilolaus, who joined that succession by positing limiters and\nunlimiteds as first principles, a Pythagorean. Plato is often thought\nto be heavily indebted to the Pythagoreans, but he is almost as\nparsimonious in his references to Pythagoras as Aristotle and mentions\nhim only once in his writings. Plato’s one reference to Pythagoras\n(R. 600a) treats him as the founder of a way of life, just as\nAristotle does, and, when Plato traces the history of philosophy prior\nto his time in the Sophist, (242c-e), there is no allusion to\nPythagoras. In the Philebus, Plato does describe the\nphilosophy of limiters and unlimiteds, which Aristotle assigns to the\nso-called Pythagoreans of the fifth century and which is found in the\nfragments of Philolaus, but like Aristotle he does not ascribe this\nphilosophy to Pythagoras himself. Scholars, both ancient and modern,\nunder the influence of the later glorification of Pythagoras, have\nsupposed that the Prometheus, whom Plato describes as hurling the\nsystem down to men, was Pythagoras (e.g., Kahn 2002: 13–14), but\ncareful reading of the passage shows that Prometheus is just\nPrometheus and that Plato, like Aristotle, assigns the philosophical\nsystem to a group of men (Huffman 1999a, 2001). The fragments of\nPhilolaus show that he was the primary figure of this group. When\nPlato refers to Philolaus in the Phaedo (61d-e), he does not\nidentify him as a Pythagorean, so that once again Plato agrees with\nAristotle in distancing the “so-called Pythagoreans” of\nthe fifth century from Pythagoras himself.  For both Plato and\nAristotle, then, Pythagoras is not a part of the cosmological and\nmetaphysical tradition of Presocratic philosophy nor is he closely\nconnected to the metaphysical system presented by fifth-century\nPythagoreans like Philolaus; he is instead the founder of a way of\nlife. \n\nReferences to Pythagoras by Xenophanes (ca. 570–475 BCE) and\nHeraclitus (fl. ca. 500 BCE) show that he was a famous figure in the\nlate sixth and early fifth centuries. For the details of his life we\nhave to rely on fourth-century sources such as Aristoxenus,\nDicaearchus and Timaeus of Tauromenium. There is a great deal of\ncontroversy about his origin and early life, but there is agreement\nthat he grew up on the island of Samos, near the birthplace of Greek\nphilosophy, Miletus, on the coast of Asia Minor. There are a number of\nreports that he traveled widely in the Near East while living on\nSamos, e.g., to Babylonia, Phoenicia and Egypt. To some extent reports\nof these trips are an attempt to claim the ancient wisdom of the east\nfor Pythagoras and some scholars totally reject them (Zhmud 2012,\n83–91), but relatively early sources such as Herodotus (II. 81) and\nIsocrates (Busiris 28) associate Pythagoras with Egypt, so\nthat a trip there seems quite plausible. Aristoxenus says that he left\nSamos at the age of forty, when the tyranny of Polycrates, who came to\npower ca. 535 BCE, became unbearable (Porphyry, VP 9). This\nchronology would suggest that he was born ca. 570 BCE. He then\nemigrated to the Greek city of Croton in southern Italy ca. 530 BCE;\nit is in Croton that he first seems to have attracted a large number\nof followers to his way of life. There are a variety of stories about\nhis death, but the most reliable evidence (Aristoxenus and\nDicaearchus) suggests that violence directed against Pythagoras and\nhis followers in Croton ca. 510 BCE, perhaps because of the exclusive\nnature of the Pythagorean way of life, led him to flee to another\nGreek city in southern Italy, Metapontum, where he died around 490 BCE\n(Porphyry,\nVP 54–7; Iamblichus, VP 248 ff.; On the chronology,\nsee Minar 1942, 133–5). There is little else about his life of which\nwe can be confident. \n\nThe evidence suggests that Pythagoras did not write any books. No\nsource contemporaneous with Pythagoras or in the first two hundred\nyears after his death, including Plato, Aristotle and their immediate\nsuccessors in the Academy and Lyceum, quotes from a work by Pythagoras\nor gives any indication that any works written by him were in\nexistence. Several later sources explicitly assert that Pythagoras\nwrote nothing (e.g., Lucian [Slip of the Tongue, 5],\nJosephus, Plutarch and Posidonius in DK 14A18; see Burkert 1972,\n218–9). Diogenes Laertius tried to dispute this tradition by\nquoting Heraclitus’ assertion that “Pythagoras, the son of\nMnesarchus, practiced inquiry most of all men and, by selecting these\nthings which have been written up, made for himself a wisdom, a\npolymathy, an evil conspiracy” (Fr.  129). This fragment shows\nonly that Pythagoras read the writings of others, however, and says\nnothing about him writing something of his own. The wisdom and evil\nconspiracy that Pythagoras constructs from these writings need not\nhave been in writing, and Heraclitus’ description of it as an\n“evil conspiracy” rather suggests that it was not (For the\ntranslation and interpretation of Fr. 129, see Huffman 2008b). In the\nlater tradition several books came to be ascribed to Pythagoras, but\nsuch evidence as exists for these books indicates that they were\nforged in Pythagoras’ name and belong with the large number of\npseudo-Pythagorean treatises forged in the name of early Pythagoreans\nsuch as Philolaus and Archytas. In the third century BCE a group of\nthree books were circulating in Pythagoras’ name, On\nEducation, On Statesmanship, and On Nature\n(Diogenes Laertius, VIII.  6). A letter from Plato to Dion asking him\nto purchase these three books from Philolaus was forged in order to\n“authenticate” them (Burkert 1972a,\n223–225). Heraclides Lembus in the second century BCE gives a\nlist of six books ascribed to Pythagoras (Diogenes Laertius, VIII. 7;\nThesleff 1965, 155–186 provides a complete collection of the\nspurious writings assigned to Pythagoras). The second of these is\na Sacred Discourse, which some have wanted to trace back to\nPythagoras himself. The idea that Pythagoras wrote such a Sacred\nDiscourse seems to arise from a misreading of the early evidence.\nHerodotus says that the Pythagoreans agreed with the Egyptians in not\nallowing the dead to be buried in wool and then asserts that there is\na sacred discourse about this (II. 81). Herodotus’ focus here is the\nEgyptians and not the Pythagoreans, who are introduced as a Greek\nparallel, so that the Sacred Discourse to which he refers is\nEgyptian and not Pythagorean, as similar passages elsewhere in Book II\nof Herodotus show (e.g., II. 62; see Burkert 1972a, 219).Various lines\nof hexameter verse were already circulating in Pythagoras’ name in the\nthird century BCE and were later combined into a compilation known as\nthe Golden Verses, which marks the culmination of the\ntradition of a Sacred Discourse assgined to Pythagoras\n(Burkert 1972a, 219, Thesleff 1965, 158–163; and most recently\nThom 1995, although his dating of the compilation before 300 BCE is\nquestionable). The lack of any viable written text which could be\nreasonably ascribed to Pythagoras is shown most clearly by the\ntendency of later authors to quote either Empedocles or Plato, when\nthey needed to quote “Pythagoras” (e.g., Sextus Empiricus,\nM. IX. 126–30; Nicomachus, Introduction to\nArithmetic I. 2). For an interesting but ultimately unconvincing\nattempt to argue that the historical Pythagoras did write books, see\nRiedweg 2005, 42–43 and the response by Huffman 2008a, 205–207. \n\nOne of the manifestations of the attempt to glorify Pythagoras in the\nlater tradition is the report that he, in fact, invented the word\nphilosophy. This story goes back to the early Academy, since it is\nfirst found in Heraclides of Pontus (Cicero, Tusc. V 3.8;\nDiogenes Laertius, Proem). The historical accuracy of the\nstory is called into question by its appearance not in a historical or\nbiographical text but rather in a dialogue that recounted Empedocles’\nrevival of a woman who had stopped breathing. Moreover, the story\ndepends on a conception of a philosopher as having no knowledge but\nbeing situated between ignorance and knowledge and striving for\nknowledge. Such a conception is thoroughly Platonic, however (see,\ne.g., Symposium 204A), and Burkert demonstrated that it could\nnot belong to the historical Pythagoras (1960). For a recent attempt\nto defend at least the partial accuracy of the story, see Riedweg\n2005: 90–97 and the response by Huffman 2008a:207–208; see\nalso Zhmud 2012a, 428–430. \n\nEven if he did not invent the word, what can we say about the\nphilosophy of Pythagoras? For the reasons given in 1. The Pythagorean\nQuestion and 2. Sources above, any responsible account of Pythagoras’\nphilosophy must be based in the first place on the evidence prior to\nAristotle and in the second place on evidence that our sources\nexplicitly identify as deriving from Aristotle’s books on the\nPythagoreans as well as from the books of his pupils such as\nAristoxenus and Dicaearchus. There is general agreement as to what the\npre-Aristotelian evidence is, although there are differences in\ninterpretation of it. There is less agreement as to what should be\nincluded in Aristotle’s, Dicaearchus’ and Aristoxenus’ evidence. What\none includes as evidence from these authors will have a significant\neffect on one’s picture of Pythagoras. One particularly pressing\nquestion is whether both chapters 18 and 19 of Porphyry’s Life of\nPythagoras should be regarded as deriving from Dicaearchus, as\nthe most recent editor proposes (Mirhady Fr. 40), or whether only\nchapter 18 should be included, as in the earlier edition of Wehrli\n(Fr.33). It is crucial to decide this question before developing a\npicture of the philosophy of Pythagoras since chapter 19, if it is by\nDicaearchus, is our earliest summary of Pythagorean\nphilosophy. Porphyry is very reliable about quoting his sources. He\nexplicitly cites Dicaearchus at the beginning of Chapter 18 and names\nNicomachus as his source at the beginning of chapter 20. The material\nin chapter 19 follows seamlessly on chapter 18: the description of the\nspeeches that Pythagoras gave upon his arrival in Croton in chapter 18\nis followed in chapter 19 by an account of the disciples that he\ngained as the result of those speeches and a discussion of what he\ntaught these disciples. Thus, the onus is on anyone who would claim\nthat Porphyry changes sources before the explicit change at the\nbeginning of chapter 20. Chapter 19 provides a very restrained account\nof what can be reliably known about Pythagoras’ teachings and that\nvery restraint is one of the strongest supporting arguments for its\nbeing based on Dicaearchus, since Porphyry or anyone else in the\nluxuriant later tradition would be expected to give a much more\nexpanisve presentation of Pythagoras in accordance with the\nNeopythagorean view of him (Burkert 1972a, 122–123). Wehrli gives no\nreason for not including chapter 19 and the great majority of scholars\naccept it as being based on Dicaearchus (see the references in Burkert\n1972a, 122, n.7). Zhmud (2012a, 157) following Philip (1966, 139)\nargues that the passage cannot derive from Dicaearchus, since it\npresents immortality of the soul with approval, whereas Dicaearchus\ndid not accept its immortality. However, the passage merely reports\nthat Pythagoras introduced the notion of the immortality of the soul\nwithout expressing approval or disapproval. Zhmud lists other features\nof the chapter that he regards as unparalleled in fourth-century\nsources (2012a, 157) but, since the evidence is so fragmentary, such\narguments from silence can carry little weight. Nothing in the chapter\nis demonstrably late or inconsistent with Dicaearchus’ authorship so\nwe must follow what is suggested by the context in Porphyry and regard\nit as derived from Dicaearchus. \n\nIn the face of the Pythagorean question and the problems that arise\neven regarding the early sources, it is reasonable to wonder if we can\nsay anything about Pythagoras. A minimalist might argue that the early\nevidence only allows us to conclude that Pythagoras was a historical\nfigure who achieved fame for his wisdom but that it is impossible to\ndetermine in what that wisdom consisted. We might say that he was\ninterested in the fate of the soul and taught a way of life, but we\ncan say nothing precise about the nature of that life or what he\ntaught about the soul (Lloyd 2014). There is some reason to believe,\nhowever, that something more than this can be said. \n\nThe earliest evidence makes clear that above all Pythagoras was known\nas an expert on the fate of our soul after death. Herodotus tells the\nstory of the Thracian Zalmoxis, who taught his countrymen that they\nwould never die but instead go to a place where they would eternally\npossess all good things (IV. 95). Among the Greeks the tradition arose\nthat this Zalmoxis was the slave of Pythagoras. Herodotus himself\nthinks that Zalmoxis lived long before Pythagoras, but the Greeks’\nwillingness to portray Zalmoxis as Pythagoras’ slave shows that they\nthought of Pythagoras as the expert from whom Zalmoxis derived his\nteaching. Ion of Chios (5th c. BCE) says of Phercydes of\nSyros that “although dead he has a pleasant life for his soul,\nif Pythagoras is truly wise, who knew and learned wisdom beyond all\nmen.” Here Pythagoras is again the expert on the life of the\nsoul after death. A famous fragment of Xenophanes, Pythagoras’\ncontemporary, provides some more specific information on what happens\nto the soul after death. He reports that “once when he\n[Pythagoras] was present at the beating of a puppy, he pitied it and\nsaid ‘stop, don’t keep hitting him, since it is the soul of a\nman who is dear to me, which I recognized, when I heard it\nyelping’” (Fr. 7).  Although Xenophanes clearly finds the\nidea ridiculous, the fragment shows that Pythagoras believed in\nmetempsychosis or reincarnation, according to which human souls were\nreborn into other animals after death. This early evidence is\nemphatically confirmed by Dicaearchus in the fourth century, who first\ncomments on the difficulty of determining what Pythagoras taught and\nthen asserts that his most recognized doctrines were “that the\nsoul is immortal and that it transmigrates into other kinds of\nanimals” (Porphyry, VP 19). Unfortunately we can say\nlittle more about the details of Pythagoras’ conception of\nmetempsychosis. According to Herodotus, the Egyptians believed that\nthe soul was reborn as every sort of animal before returning to human\nform after 3,000 years. Without naming names, he reports that some\nGreeks both earlier and later adopted this doctrine; this seems very\nlikely to be a reference to Pythagoras (earlier) and perhaps\nEmpedocles (later).  Many doubt that Herodotus is right to assign\nmetempsychosis to the Egyptians, since none of the other evidence we\nhave for Egyptian beliefs supports his claim, but it is nonetheless\nclear that we cannot assume that Pythagoras accepted the details of\nthe view Herodotus ascribes to them. Similarly both Empedocles (see\nInwood 2001, 55–68) and Plato (e.g., Republic X and\nPhaedrus) provide a more detailed account of transmigration\nof souls, but neither of them ascribes these details to Pythagoras nor\nshould we. Did he think that we ever escape the cycle of\nreincarnations? We simply do not know.  The fragment of Ion quoted\nabove may suggest that the soul could have a pleasant existence after\ndeath between reincarnations or even escape the cycle of reincarnation\naltogether, but the evidence is too weak to be confident in such a\nconclusion. In the fourth century several authors report that\nPythagoras remembered his previous human incarnations, but the\naccounts do not agree on the details. Dicaearchus (Aulus Gellius\nIV. 11.14) and Heraclides (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 4) agree that he\nwas the Trojan hero Euphorbus in a previous life. Dicaearchus\ncontinues the tradition of savage satire begun by Xenophanes, when he\nsuggests that Pythagoras was the beautiful prostitute, Alco, in\nanother incarnation (Huffman 2014b, 281–285). \n\nIt is not clear how Pythagoras conceived of the nature of the\ntransmigrating soul but a few tentative conjectures can be made\n(Huffman 2009). Transmigration does not require that the soul be\nimmortal; it could go through several incarnations before perishing.\nDicaearchus explicitly says that Pythagoras regarded the soul as\nimmortal, however, and this agrees with Herodotus’ description of\nZalmoxis’ view.  It is likely that he used the Greek\nword psychê to refer to the transmigrating soul, since\nthis is the word used by all sources reporting his views, unlike\nEmpedocles, who used daimon. His successor, Philoalus,\nuses psychê to refer not to a comprehensive soul but\nrather to just one psychic faculty, the seat of emotions, which is\nlocated in the heart along with the faculty of sensation (Philolaus,\nFr. 13). This psychê is explicitly said by Philolaus to\nbe shared with animals. Herodotus uses psychê in a\nsimilar way to refer to the seat of emotions. Thus it seems likely\nthat Pythagoras too thought of the\ntransmigrating psychê in this way. If so, it is\nunlikely that Pythagoras thought that humans could be reincarnated as\nplants, since psychê is not assigned to plants by\nPhilolaus. It has often been assumed that the transmigrating soul is\nimmaterial, but Philolaus seems to have a materialistic conception of\nsoul and he may be following Pythagoras. Similarly, it is doubtful\nthat Pythagoras thought of the transmigrating soul as a comprehensive\nsoul that includes all psychic faculties. His ability to recognize\nsomething distinctive of his friend in the puppy (if this is not\npushing the evidence of a joke too far) and to remember his own\nprevious incarnations show that personal identity was preserved\nthrough incarnations. This personal identity could well be contained\nin the pattern of emotions, that constitute a person’s character and\nthat is preserved in the psychê and need not presuppose\nall psychic faculties. In Philolaus this psychê\nexplicitly does not include the nous (intellect), which is\nnot shared with animals. Thus, it would appear that what is shared\nwith animals and which led Pythagoras to suppose that they had special\nkinship with human beings (Dicaearchus in Porphyry, VP 19) is\nnot intellect, as some have supposed (Sorabji 1993, 78 and 208) but\nrather the ability to feel emotions such as pleasure and pain.  \n\nThere are significant points of contact between the Greek religious\nmovement known as Orphism and Pythagoreanism, but the evidence for\nOrphism is at least as problematic as that for Pythagoras and often\ncomplicates rather than clarifies our understanding of Pythagoras\n(Betegh 2014; Burkert 1972a, 125 ff.; Kahn 2002, 19–22; Riedweg\n2002). There is some evidence that the Orphics also believed in\nmetempsychosis and considerable debate has arisen as to whether they\nborrowed the doctrine from Pythagoras (Burkert 1972a, 133; Bremmer\n2002, 24) or he borrowed it from them (Zhmud 2012a,\n221–238). Dicaearchus says that Pythagoras was the first to introduce\nmetempsychosis into Greece (Porphyry VP 19). Moreover, while\nOrphism presents a heavily moralized version of metempsychosis in\naccordance with which we are born again for punishment in this life so\nthat our body is the prison of the soul while it undergoes punishment,\nit is not clear that the same was true in Pythagoreanism. It may be\nthat rebirths in a series of animals and people were seen as a natural\ncycle of the soul (Zhmud 2012a, 232–233). One would expect that the\nPythagorean way of life was connected to metempsychosis, which would\nin turn suggest that a certain reincarnation is a reward or punishment\nfor following or not following the principles set out in that way of\nlife. However, there is no unambiguous evidence connecting the\nPythagorean way of life with metempsychosis.  \n\n  It is crucial to recognize that most Greeks followed Homer in\nbelieving that the soul was an insubstantial shade, which lived a\nshadowy existence in the underworld after death, an existence so bleak\nthat Achilles famously asserts that he would rather be the lowest\nmortal on earth than king of the dead (Homer, Odyssey\nXI. 489). Pythagoras’ teachings that the soul was immortal, would have\nother physical incarnations and might have a good existence after\ndeath were striking innovations that must have had considerable appeal\nin comparison to the Homeric view.  According to Dicaearchus, in\naddition to the immortality of the soul and reincarnation, Pythagoras\nbelieved that “after certain periods of time the things that\nhave happened once happen again and nothing is absolutely new”\n(Porphyry, VP 19).  This doctrine of “eternal\nrecurrence” is also attested by Aristotle’s pupil Eudemus,\nalthough he ascribes it to the Pythagoreans rather than to Pythagoras\nhimself.  (Fr. 88 Wehrli). The doctrine of transmigration thus seems\nto have been extended to include the idea that we and indeed the whole\nworld will be reborn into lives that are exactly the same as those we\nare living and have already lived. \n\nSome have wanted to relegate the more miraculous features of\nPythagoras’ persona to the later tradition, but these\ncharacteristics figure prominently in the earliest evidence and are\nthus central to understanding Pythagoras. Aristotle emphasized his\nsuperhuman nature in the following ways: there was a story that\nPythagoras had a golden thigh (a sign of divinity); the Pythagoreans\ntaught that “of rational beings, one sort is divine, one is\nhuman, and another such as Pythagoras” (Iamblichus, VP\n31); Pythagoras was seen on the same day at the same time in both\nMetapontum and Croton; he killed a deadly snake by biting it; as he\nwas crossing a river it spoke to him (all citations are from\nAristotle, Fr. 191, unless otherwise noted). Aristotle reports that\nthe people of Croton called Pythagoras the “Hyperborean Apollo” and\nIamblichus’ report (VP 140) that a priest from the land of\nthe Hyperboreans, Abaris, visited Pythagoras and presented him with\nhis arrow, a token of power, may well also go back to Aristotle\n(Burkert 1972a, 143). Kingsley argues that the visit of Abaris is the\nkey to understanding the identity and significance of\nPythagoras. Abaris was a shaman from Mongolia (part of what the Greeks\ncalled Hyperborea), who recognized Pythagoras as an incarnation of\nApollo. The stillness of ecstacy practiced by Abaris and handed on to\nPythagoras is the foundation of all civilization. Abaris’ visit to\nPythagoras thus beomces the central moment when civilizing power is\npassed from East to West (Kingsley 2010).  \n\nWhether or not one accepts this account of Pythagoras and his relation\nto Abaris, there is a clear parallel for some of the remarkable\nabilities of Pythagoras in the later figure of Empedocles, who\npromises to teach his pupils to control the winds and bring the dead\nback to life (Fr. 111). There are recognizable traces of this\ntradition about Pythagoras even in the pre-Aristotelian evidence, and\nhis wonder-working clearly evoked diametrically opposed reactions.\nHeraclitus’ description of Pythagoras as “the chief of the\ncharlatans” (Fr. 81) and of his wisdom as “fraudulent\nart” (Fr. 129) is most easily understood as an unsympathetic\nreference to his miracles. Empedocles, on the other hand, is clearly\nsympathetic to Pythagoras, when he describes him as “ a man who\nknew remarkable things” and who “possessed the greatest\nwealth of intelligence” and again probably makes reference to\nhis wonder-working by calling him “accomplished in all sorts of\nwise deeds”(Fr. 129). In Herodotus’ report, Zalmoxis,\nwhom some of the Greeks identified as the slave and pupil of\nPythagoras, tried to gain authority for his teachings about the fate\nof the soul by claiming to have journeyed to the next world\n(IV. 95). The skeptical tradition represented in Herodotus’ report\ntreats this as a ruse on Zalmoxis’ part; he had not journeyed to the\nnext world but had in reality hidden in an underground dwelling for\nthree years. Similarly Pythagoras may have claimed authority for his\nteachings concerning the fate of our soul on the basis of his\nremarkable abilities and experiences, and there is some evidence that\nhe too claimed to have journeyed to the underworld and that this\njourney may have been transferred from Pythagoras to Zalmoxis (Burkert\n1972a,154 ff.). \n\nThe testimony of both Plato (R. 600a) and Isocrates\n(Busiris 28) shows that Pythagoras was above all famous for\nhaving left behind him a way of life, which still had adherents in the\nfourth century over 100 years after his death. It is plausible to\nassume that many features of this way of life were designed to insure\nthe best possible future reincarnations, but it is important to\nremember that nothing in the early evidence connects the way of life\nto reincarnation in any specific fashion.  \n\nOne of the clearest strands in the early evidence for Pythagoras is\nhis expertise in religious ritual. Isocrates emphasizes that “he\nmore conspicuously than others paid attention to sacrifices and\nrituals in temples” (Busiris 28). Herodotus gives an\nexample: the Pythagoreans agree with the Egyptians in not allowing the\ndead to be buried in wool (II. 81). It is not surprising that\nPythagoras, as an expert on the fate of the soul after death. should\nalso be an expert on the religious rituals surrounding death. A\nsignificant part of the Pythagorean way of life thus consisted in the\nproper observance of religious ritual. One major piece of evidence for\nthis emphasis on ritual is the symbola or acusmata\n(“things heard”), short maxims that were handed down\norally. The earliest source to quote acusmata is Aristotle,\nin the fragments of his now lost treatise on the Pythagoreans. It is\nnot always possible to be certain which of the acusmata\nquoted in the later tradition go back to Aristotle and which of the\nones that do go back to Pythagoras. Most of Iamblichus’ examples in\nsections 82–86 of On the Pythagorean Life, however,\nappear to derive from Aristotle (Burkert 1972a, 166 ff.), and many are\nin accord with the early evidence we have for Pythagoras’ interest in\nritual. Thus the\nacusmata advise Pythagoreans to pour libations to the gods\nfrom the ear (i.e., the handle) of the cup, to refrain from wearing\nthe images of the gods on their fingers, not to sacrifice a white\ncock, and to sacrifice and enter the temple barefoot. A number of\nthese practices can be paralleled in Greek mystery religions of the\nday (Burkert 1972a, 177). Indeed, it is important to emphasize that\nPythagoreanism was not a religion and there were no specific\nPythagorean rites (Burkert 1985, 302). Pythagoras rather taught a way\nof life that emphasized certain aspects of traditional Greek\nreligion.  \n\nA second characteristic of the Pythagorean way of life was the\nemphasis on dietary restrictions. There is no direct evidence for\nthese restrictions in the pre-Aristotelian evidence, but both\nAristotle and Aristoxenus discuss them extensively. Unfortunately the\nevidence is contradictory and it is difficult to establish any points\nwith certainty. One might assume that Pythagoras advocated\nvegetarianism on the basis of his belief in metempsychosis, as did\nEmpedocles after him (Fr. 137). Indeed, the fourth-century\nmathematician and philosopher Eudoxus says that “he not only\nabstained from animal food but would also not come near butchers and\nhunters” (Porphyry, VP 7). According to Dicaearchus,\none of Pythagoras’ most well-known doctrines was that “all\nanimate beings are of the same family” (Porphyry, VP\n19), which suggests that we should be as hesitant about eating other\nanimals as other humans.  Unfortunately, Aristotle reports that\n“the Pythagoreans refrain from eating the womb and the heart,\nthe sea anemone and some other such things but use all other animal\nfood” (Aulus Gellius IV. 11. 11–12). This makes it sound\nas if Pythagoras forbade the eating of just certain parts of animals\nand certain species of animals rather than all animals; such specific\nprohibitions are easy to parallel elsewhere in Greek ritual (Burkert\n1972a, 177). Aristoxenus asserts that Pythagoras only refused to eat\nplough oxen and rams (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 20) and that he was fond\nof young kids and suckling pigs as food (Aulus Gellius\nIV. 11. 6). Some have tried to argue that Aristoxenus is refashioning\nPythagoreanism in order to make it more rational (e.g., Kahn 2001, 70;\nZhmud 2012b, 228), but Aristoxenus, in fact, recognizes the\nnon-rational dimension of Pythagoreanism and Pythagoras’ eating of\nkids and suckling pigs may itself have religious motivations (Huffman\n2012b). Moreover, even if Aristoxenus’ evidence were set aside\nAristotle’s testimony and many of the\nacusmata indicate that Pythagoras ate some meat. Certainly\nanimal sacrifice was the central act of Greek religious worship and to\nabolish it completely would be a radical step. The acusma\nreported by Aristotle, in response to the question “what is most\njust?” has Pythagoras answer “to sacrifice”\n(Iamblichus, VP 82). Based on the direct evidence for\nPythagoras’ practice in Aristotle and Aristoxenus, it seems most\nprudent to conclude that he did not forbid the eating of all animal\nfood. The later tradition proposes a number of ways to reconcile\nmetempsychosis with the eating of some meat. Pythagoras may have\nadopted one of these positions, but no certainty is possible. For\nexample, he may have argued that it was legitimate to kill and eat\nsacrificial animals, on the grounds that the souls of men do not enter\ninto these animals (Iamblichus, VP 85). Perhaps the most\nfamous of the Pythagorean dietary restrictions is the prohibition on\neating beans, which is first attested by Aristotle and assigned to\nPythagoras himself (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 34). Aristotle suggests a\nnumber of explanations including one that connects beans with Hades,\nhence suggesting a possible connection with the doctrine of\nmetempsychosis. A number of later sources suggest that it was believed\nthat souls returned to earth to be reincarnated through beans (Burkert\n1972a, 183). There is also a physiological explanation. Beans, which\nare difficult to digest, disturb our abilities to concentrate.\nMoreover, the beans involved are a European vetch (Vicia\nfaba) rather than the beans commonly eaten today. Certain people\nwith an inherited blood abnormality develop a serious disorder called\nfavism, if they eat these beans or even inhale their\npollen. Aristoxenus interestingly denies that Pythagoras forbade the\neating of beans and says that “he valued it most of all\nvegetables, since it was digestible and laxative” (Aulus Gellius\nIV.  11.5). The discrepancies between the various fourth-century\naccounts of the Pythagorean way of life suggest that there were\ndisputes among fourth-century Pythagoreans as to the proper way of\nlife and as to the teachings of Pythagoras himself. \n\nThe acusmata indicate that the Pythagorean way of life\nembodied a strict regimen not just regarding religious ritual and diet\nbut also in almost every aspect of life. Some of the restrictions\nappear to be largely arbitrary taboos, e.g., “one must put the\nright shoe on first” or “one must not travel the public\nroads” (Iamblichus, VP 83, probably from Aristotle). On\nthe other hand, some aspects of the Pythagorean life involved a moral\ndiscipline that was greatly admired, even by outsiders. Pythagorean\nsilence is an important example. Isocrates reports that even in the\nfourth century people “marvel more at the silence of those who\nprofess to be his pupils than at those who have the greatest\nreputation for speaking” (Busiris 28). The ability to\nremain silent was seen as important training in self-control, and the\nlater tradition reports that those who wanted to become Pythagoreans\nhad to observe a five-year silence (Iamblichus, VP\n72). Isocrates is contrasting the marvelous self-control of\nPythagorean silence with the emphasis on public speaking in\ntraditional Greek education.  Pythagoreans also displayed great\nloyalty to their friends as can be seen in Aristoxenus’ story of Damon\nwho is willing to stand surety for his friend Phintias, who has been\nsentenced to death (Iamblichus, VP 233 ff.). In addition to\nsilence as a moral discipline, there is evidence that secrecy was kept\nabout certain of the teachings of Pythagoras. Aristoxenus reports that\nthe Pythagoreans thought that “not all things were to be spoken\nto all people” (Diogenes Laertius, VIII. 15), but this may only\napply to teaching and mean that children should not be taught all\nthings (Zhmud 2012a, 155). Clearer evidence is found in Dicaearchus’\ncomplaint that it is not easy to say what Pythagoras taught his pupils\nbecause they observed no ordinary silence about it\n(Porphyry, VP 19). Indeed, one would expect that an exclusive\nsociety such as that of the Pythagoreans would have secret doctrines\nand symbols. Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans “guarded among\ntheir very secret doctrines that one type of rational being is divine,\none human, and one such as Pythagoras” (Iamblichus, VP\n31). That there should be secret teachings about the special nature\nand authority of the master is not surprising. This does not mean,\nhowever, that all Pythagorean philosophy was secret. Aristotle\ndiscusses the fifth-century metaphysical system of Philolaus in some\ndetail with no hint that there was anything secret about it, and\nPlato’s discussion of Pythagorean harmonic theory in Book VII of the\nRepublic gives no suggestion of any secrecy.  Aristotle\nsingles out the acusma quoted above (Iamblichus, VP\n31) as secret, but this statement in itself implies that others were\nnot. The idea that all of Pythagoras’ teachings were secret was used\nin the later tradition to explain the lack of Pythagorean writings and\nto try to validate forged documents as recently discovered secret\ntreatises. For a sceptical evaluation of Pythagorean secrecy see Zhmud\n2012a, 150–158. \n\nThere is some controversy as to whether Pythagoras, in fact, taught a\nway of life governed in great detail by the acusmata as\ndescribed above. Plato praises the Pythagorean way of life in\nthe Republic (600b), but it is hard to imagine him admiring\nthe set of taboos found in the acusmata (Lloyd 2014, 44;\nZhmud 2012a). Although acusmata were collected already by\nAnaximander of Miletus the younger (ca. 400 BCE) and by Aristotle in\nthe fourth century, Zhmud (2012a, 177–178 and 192–205) argues that\nvery few of these embody specifically Pythagorean ideas and that it is\ndifficult to imagine anyone following this bewildering set of rules\nliterally as Burkert argues (1972a, 191). However, the early evidence\nsuggests that Pythagoras largely constructed the acusmata out\nof ideas collected from others (Thom 2013; Huffman 2008b: Gemelli\nMarciano 2002), so it is no surprise that many of them are not\nuniquely Pythagorean. Moreover, Thom suggests a middle ground between\nZhmud and Burkert whereby, contra Zhmud, most of the acusmata\nwere followed by the Pythagoreans but contra Burkert, they were\nsubject to interpretation from the beginning and not followed\nliterally, so that it is possible to imagine people living according\nto them (Thom, 2013). It is true that there is little if any fifth-\nand fourth-century evidence for Pythagoreans living according to\nthe acusmata and Zhmud argues that the undeniable political\nimpact of the Pythagoreans would be inexplicable if they lived the\nheavily ritualized life of the acusmata, which would\ninevitably isolate them from society (Zhmud 2012a, 175–183). He\nsuggests that the Pythagorean way of life differed little from\nstandard aristocratic morality (Zhmud 2012a, 175). If, however, the\nPythagorean way of life was little out of the ordinary, why do Plato\nand Isocrates specifically comment on how distinctive those who\nfollowed it were? The silence of fifth-century sources about people\npracticing acusmata is not terribly surprising given the very\nmeager sources for the Greek cities in southern Italy in the\nperiod. Why not suppose that the vast majority of names in\nAristoxenus’ catalogue of Pythagoreans, who are not associated with\nany political, philosophical or scientific accomplishment, who are\njust names to us, are preceisely those who were Pythagoreans because\nthey followed the Pythagorean way of life? We would then have lots of\npeople who followed the acusmata (166 of the 222 name in the\ncatalogue appear nowhere else). This suspicion is confirmed by the\nfact that one of the names from Arsitoxenus’ catalogue (Hippomedon of\nArgos) is elsewhere (Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life, 87)\nexplicitly said to belong the acusmatici. Moreover, other\nscholars argue that archaic Greek society in southern Italy was\npervaded by religion and the presence of similar precepts in authors\nsuch as Hesiod show that adherence to taboos such as are found in\nthe acusmata would not have caused a scandal and adherence to\nmany of them would have gone unobserved by outsiders (Gemelli Marciano\n2014, 133–134). \n\nOnce again a problem of source criticism raises its head. Zhmud argues\nthat the split between acusmatici who blindly followed\nthe acusmata and the mathematici who learned the\nreasons for them (see the fifth paragraph of section 5 below) is a\ncreation of the later tradition, appearing first in Clement of\nAlexandria and disappearing after Iamblichus (Zhmud 2012a,\n169–192). He also notes that the term acusmata appears first\nin Iamblichus (On the Pythagorean Life 82–86) and suggests\nthat it is also a creation of the later tradition. The Pythagorean\nmaxims did exist earlier, as the testimony of Aristotle shows, but\nthey were known as symbola, were originally very few in\nnumber and were mainly a literary phenomena rather than being tied to\npeople who actually practiced them (Zhmud 2012a, 192–205). However,\nseveral scholars have argued that the passages in which the split\nbetween the acusmatici and mathematici is described\nas well as the passage in which the term acusmata is used, in\nfact, go back to Aristotle (Burkert 1972a, 196; see Burkert 1998, 315\nwhere he comments that the Aristotelian provenance of the text is “as\nobvious as it is unprovable”) and even Zhmud recognizes that a large\npart of the material in Iamblichus is derived from Aristotle (2012a,\n170). Indeed, the description of the split in what is likely to be the\noriginal version (Iamblichus, On General Mathematical Science\n76.16–77.18 Festa) uses language in describing the Pythagoreans that\nis almost an Aristotelian signature, “There are two forms of the\nItalian philosophy which is called Pythagorean”\n(76.16). Aristotle famously describes the Pythagoreans as “those\ncalled Pythagoreans” and also describes them as “the\nItalians” (e.g., Mete. 342b30, Cael.\n293a20). So the question of whether Pythagoras taught a way of life\ntightly governed by the acusmata turns again on whether key\npassages in Iamblichus (On the Pythagorean Life 81–87, On\nGeneral Mathematical Science 76.16–77.18 Festa) go back to\nAristotle. If they do, we have very good reason to believe that\nPythagoras taught such a life, if they do not the issue is less\nclear. \n\nThe testimony of fourth-century authors such as Aristoxenus and\nDicaearchus indicates that the Pythagoreans also had an important\nimpact on the politics and society of the Greek cities in southern\nItaly. Dicaearchus reports that, upon his arrival in Croton,\nPythagoras gave a speech to the elders and that the leaders of the\ncity then asked him to speak to the young men of the town, the boys\nand the women (Porphyry, VP 18). Women, indeed, may have\nplayed an unusually large role in Pythagoreanism (see Rowett 2014,\n122–123), since both Timaeus and Dicaearchus report on the fame of\nPythagorean women including Pythagoras’ daughter\n(Porphyry, VP 4 and 19). The\nacusmata teach men to honor their wives and to beget children\nin order to insure worship for the gods (Iamblichus, VP\n84–6). Dicaearchus reports that the teaching of Pythagoras was\nlargely unknown, so that Dicaearchus cannot have known of the content\nof the speech to the women or of any of the other speeches; the\nspeeches presented in Iamblichus (VP 37–57) are thus\nlikely to be later forgeries (Burkert 1972a, 115), but there is early\nevidence that he gave different speeches to different groups\n(Antisthenes V A 187). The attacks on the Pythagoreans both in\nPythagoras’ own day and in the middle of the fifth century are\npresented by Dicaearchus and Aristoxenus as having a wide-reaching\nimpact on Greek society in southern Italy; the historian Polybius\n(II. 39) reports that the deaths of the Pythagoreans meant that\n“the leading citizens of each city were destroyed,” which\nclearly indicates that many Pythagoreans had positions of political\nauthority. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Plato explicitly\npresents Pythagoras as a private rather than a public figure\n(R. 600a). It seems most likely that the Pythagorean\nsocieties were in essence private associations but that they also\ncould function as political clubs (see Zhmud 2012a, 141–148), while\nnot being a political party in the modern sense; their political\nimpact should perhaps be better compared to modern fraternal\norganizations such as the Masons. Thus, the Pythagoreans did not rule\nas a group but had political impact through individual members who\ngained positions of authority in the Greek city-states in southern\nItaly. See further Burkert 1972a, 115 ff., von Fritz 1940, Minar 1942\nand Rowett 2014. \n\nIn the modern world Pythagoras is most of all famous as a\nmathematician, because of the theorem named after him, and secondarily\nas a cosmologist, because of the striking view of a universe ascribed\nto him in the later tradition, in which the heavenly bodies produce\n“the music of the spheres” by their movements. It should\nbe clear from the discussion above that, while the early evidence\nshows that Pythagoras was indeed one of the most famous early Greek\nthinkers, there is no indication in that evidence that his fame was\nprimarily based on mathematics or cosmology. Neither Plato nor\nAristotle treats Pythagoras as having contributed to the development\nof Presocratic cosmology, although Aristotle in particular discusses\nthe topic in some detail in the first book of the Metaphysics\nand elsewhere. Aristotle evidently knows of no cosmology of Pythagoras\nthat antedates the cosmological system of the “so-called\nPythagoreans,” which he dates to the middle of the fifth\ncentury, and which is found in the fragments of Philolaus. There is\nalso no mention of Pythagoras’ work in geometry or of the Pythagorean\ntheorem in the early evidence. Dicaearchus comments that “what\nhe said to his associates no one can say reliably,” but then\nidentifies four doctrines that became well known: 1) that the soul is\nimmortal; 2) that it transmigrates into other kinds of animals; 3)\nthat after certain intervals the things that have happened once happen\nagain, so that nothing is completely new; 4) that all animate beings\nbelong to the same family (Porphyry, VP 19). Thus, for\nDicaearchus too, it is not as a mathematician or Presocratic writer on\nnature that Pythagoras is famous. It might not be too surprising that\nPlato, Aristotle and Dicaearchus do not mention Pythagoras’ work in\nmathematics, because they are not primarily dealing with the history\nof mathematics. On the other hand, Aristotle’s pupil Eudemus did write\na history of geometry in the fourth century and what we find in\nEudemus is very significant. A substantial part of Eudemus’ overview\nof the early history of Greek geometry is preserved in the prologue to\nProclus’ commentary on Book One of Euclid’s Elements (p. 65,\n12 ff.), which was written much later, in the fifth century CE.  At\nfirst sight, it appears that Eudemus did assign Pythagoras a\nsignificant place in the history of geometry. Eudemus is reported as\nbeginning with Thales and an obscure figure named Mamercus, but the\nthird person mentioned by Proclus in this report is Pythagoras,\nimmediately before Anaxagoras. There is no mention of the Pythagorean\ntheorem, but Pythagoras is said to have transformed the philosophy of\ngeometry into a form of liberal education, to have investigated its\ntheorems in an immaterial and intellectual way and specifically to\nhave discovered the study of irrational magnitudes and the\nconstruction of the five regular solids. Unfortunately close\nexamination of the section on Pythagoras in Proclus’ prologue reveals\nnumerous difficulties and shows that it comes not from Eudemus but\nfrom Iamblichus with some additions by Proclus himself (Burkert 1972a,\n409 ff.). The first clause is taken word for word from Iamblichus’\nOn Common Mathematical Science (p. 70.1 Festa). Proclus\nelsewhere quotes long passages from Iamblichus and is doing the same\nhere. As Burkert points out, however, as soon as we recognize that\nProclus has inserted a passage from Iamblichus into Eudemus’ history,\nwe must also recognize that Proclus was driven to do so by the lack of\nany mention of Pythagoras in Eudemus. Even those who want to assign\nPythagoras a larger role in early Greek mathematics recognize that\nmost of what Proclus says here cannot go back to Eudemus (Zhmud 2012a,\n263–266). Thus, not only is Pythagoras not commonly known as a\ngeometer in the time of Plato and Aristotle, but also the most\nauthoritative history of early Greek geometry assigns him no role in\nthe history of geometry in the overview preserved in\nProclus. According to Proclus, Eudemus did report that two\npropositions, which are later found in Euclid’s Elements,\nwere discoveries of the Pythagoreans (Proclus 379 and 419). Eudemus\ndoes not assign the discoveries to any specific Pythagorean, and they\nare hard to date. The discoveries might be as early as Hippasus in the\nmiddle of the fifth century, who is associated with a group of\nPythagoreans known as the\nmathematici, who arose after Pythagoras’ death (see\nbelow). The crucial point to note is that Eudemus does not assign\nthese discoveries to Pythagoras himself. The first Pythagorean whom we\ncan confidently identify as an accomplished mathematician is Archytas\nin the late fifth and the first half of the fourth century. \n\nAre we to conclude, then, that Pythagoras had nothing to do with\nmathematics or cosmology? The evidence is not quite that simple. The\ntradition regarding Pythagoras’ connection to the Pythagorean theorem\nreveals the complexity of the problem. None of the early sources,\nincluding Plato, Aristotle and their pupils shows any knowledge of\nPythagoras’ connection to the theorem.  Almost a thousand years later,\nin the fifth century CE, Proclus, in his commentary on Euclid’s proof\nof the theorem (Elements I. 47), gives the following report:\n“If we listen to those who wish to investigate ancient history,\nit is possible to find them referring this theorem back to Pythagoras\nand saying that he sacrificed an ox upon its discovery”\n(426.6). Proclus gives no indication of his source, but a number of\nother late reports (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 12; Athenaeus 418f;\nPlutarch, Moralia 1094b) show that it ultimately relied on\ntwo lines of verse whose context is unknown: “When Pythagoras\nfound that famous diagram, in honor of which he offered a glorious\nsacrifice of oxen...” The author of these verses is variously\nidentified as Apollodorus the calculator or Apollodorus the\narithmetician. This Apollodorus probably dates before Cicero, who\nalludes to the story (On the Nature of the Gods III. 88),\nand, if he can be identified with Apollodorus of Cyzicus, the follower\nof Democritus, the story would go back to the fourth century BCE\n(Burkert 1972a, 428). Two lines of poetry of indeterminate date are\nobviously a very slender support upon which to base Pythagoras’\nreputation as a geometer, but they cannot be simply ignored. Several\nthings need to be noted about this tradition, however, in order to\nunderstand its true significance.  First, Proclus does not ascribe a\nproof of the theorem to Pythagoras but rather goes on to contrast\nPythagoras as one of those “knowing the truth of the\ntheorem” with Euclid who not only gave the proof found in\nElements I.47 but also a more general proof in\nVI. 31. Although a number of modern scholars have speculated on what\nsort of proof Pythagoras might have used (e.g., Heath 1956, 352 ff.),\nit is important to note that there is not a jot of evidence for a\nproof by Pythagoras; what we know of the history of Greek geometry\nmakes such a proof by Pythagoras improbable, since the first work on\nthe elements of geometry, upon which a rigorous proof would be based,\nis not attested until Hippocrates of Chios, who was active after\nPythagoras in the latter part of the fifth century (Proclus, A\nCommentary on the First Book of Euclid’s Elements, 66). All that\nthis tradition ascribes to Pythagoras, then, is discovery of the truth\ncontained in the theorem. The truth may not have been in general form\nbut rather focused on the simplest such triangle (with sides 3, 4 and\n5), pointing out that such a triangle and all others like it will have\na right angle. Modern scholarship has shown, moreover, that long\nbefore Pythagoras the Babylonians were aware of the basic Pythagorean\nrule and could generate Pythagorean triples (integers that satisfy the\nPythagorean rule such as 3, 4 and 5), although they never formulated\nthe theorem in explicit form or proved it (Høyrup 1999, 401–2, 405;\ncf. Robson 2001). Thus, it is likely that Pythagoras and other Greeks\nfirst encountered the truth of the theorem as a Babylonian\narithmetical technique (Høyrup 1999, 402; Burkert 1972a,429). It is\npossible, then, that Pythagoras just passed on to the Greeks a truth\nthat he learned from the East. The emphasis in the two lines of verse\nis not just on Pythagoras’ discovery of the truth of the theorem, it\nis as much or more on his sacrifice of oxen in honor of the\ndiscovery. We are probably supposed to imagine that the sacrifice was\nnot of a single ox; Apollodorus describes it as “a famous\nsacrifice of oxen” and Diogenes Laertius paraphrases this as a\nhecatomb, which need not be, as it literally says, a hundred\noxen, but still suggests a large number. Some have wanted to doubt the\nwhole story, including the discovery of the theorem, because it\nconflicts with Pythagoras’ supposed vegetarianism, but it is far from\nclear to what extent he was a vegetarian (see above). If the story is\nto have any force and if it dates to the fourth century, it shows that\nPythagoras was famous for a connection to a certain piece of\ngeometrical knowledge, but it also shows that he was famous for his\nenthusiastic response to that knowledge, as evidenced in his sacrifice\nof oxen, not for any geometric proof. What emerges from this evidence,\nthen, is not Pythagoras as the master geometer, who provides rigorous\nproofs, but rather Pythagoras as someone who recognizes and celebrates\ncertain geometrical relationships as of high importance. \n\nIt is striking that a very similar picture of Pythagoras emerges from\nthe evidence for his cosmology. A famous discovery is attributed to\nPythagoras in the later tradition, i.e., that the central musical\nconcords (the octave, fifth and fourth) correspond to the whole number\nratios 2 : 1, 3 : 2 and 4 : 3 respectively (e.g., Nicomachus,\nHandbook 6 = Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life\n115). The only early source to associate Pythagoras with the whole\nnumber ratios that govern the concords is Xenocrates (Fr. 9) in the\nearly Academy, but the early Academy is precisely one source of the\nlater exaggerated tradition about Pythagoras (see above). One story\nhas it that Pythagoras passed by a blacksmith’s shop and heard the\nconcords in the sounds of the hammers striking the anvil and then\ndiscovered that the sounds made by hammers whose weights are in the\nratio 2 : 1 will be an octave apart, etc. Unfortunately, the stories\nof Pythagoras’ discovery of these relationships are clearly false,\nsince none of the techniques for the discovery ascribed to him would,\nin fact, work (e.g., the pitch of sounds produced by hammers is not\ndirectly proportional to their weight: see Burkert 1972a, 375). An\nexperiment ascribed to Hippasus, who was active in the first half of\nthe fifth century, after Pythagoras’ death, would have worked, and\nthus we can trace the scientific verification of the discovery at\nleast to Hippasus; knowledge of the relation between whole number\nratios and the concords is clearly found in the fragments of Philolaus\n(Fr. 6a, Huffman), in the second half of the fifth century. There is\nsome evidence that the truth of the relationship was already known to\nPythagoras’ contemporary, Lasus, who was not a Pythagorean (Burkert\n1972a, 377). It may be once again that Pythagoras knew of the\nrelationship without either having discovered it or having\ndemonstrated it scientifically.  The relationship was probably first\ndiscovered by instrument makers, and specifically makers of wind\ninstruments rather than stringed instruments (Barker 2014,\n202). The acusmata reported by Aristotle, which may go back\nto Pythagoras, report the following question and answer “What is\nthe oracle at Delphi? The tetraktys, which is the harmony in\nwhich the Sirens sing” (Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean\nLife, 82, probably derived from Aristotle). The\ntetraktys, literally “the four,” refers to the\nfirst four numbers, which when added together equal the number ten,\nwhich was regarded as the perfect number in fifth-century\nPythagoreanism. Here in the acusmata, these four numbers are\nidentified with one of the primary sources of wisdom in the Greek\nworld, the Delphic oracle.  In the later tradition the\ntetraktys is treated as the summary of all Pythagorean\nwisdom, since the Pythagoreans swore oaths by Pythagoras as “the\none who handed down the tetraktys to our generation.”\nThe tetraktys can be connected to the music which the Sirens\nsing in that all of the ratios that correspond to the basic concords\nin music (octave, fifth and fourth) can be expressed as whole number\nratios of the first four numbers. This acusma thus seems to\nbe based on the knowledge of the relationship between the concords and\nthe whole number ratios. The picture of Pythagoras that emerges from\nthe evidence is thus not of a mathematician, who offered rigorous\nproofs, or of a scientist, who carried out experiments to discover the\nnature of the natural world, but rather of someone who sees special\nsignificance in and assigns special prominence to mathematical\nrelationships that were in general circulation. This is the context in\nwhich to understand Aristoxenus’ remark that “Pythagoras most of\nall seems to have honored and advanced the study concerned with\nnumbers, having taken it away from the use of merchants and likening\nall things to numbers” (Fr. 23, Wehrli). Some might suppose that\nthis is a reference to a rigorous treatment of arithmetic, such as\nthat hypothesized by Becker (1936), who argued that Euclid\nIX. 21–34 was a self-contained unit that represented a deductive\ntheory of odd and even numbers developed by the Pythagoreans (see\nMueller 1997, 296 ff. and Burkert 1972a, 434 ff.). It is crucial to\nrecognize, however, that Becker’s reconstruction is rejected in some\nrecent scholarship (e.g., Netz 2014, 179) and no ancient source\nassigns it even to the Pythagoreans, let alone to Pythagoras\nhimself. There is, moreover, no talk of mathematical proof or a\ndeductive system in the passage from Aristoxenus just quoted.\nPythagoras is known for the honor he gives to number and for\nremoving it from the practical realm of trade and instead pointing to\ncorrespondences between the behavior of number and the behavior of\nthings. Such correspondences were highlighted in Aristotle’s book on\nthe Pythagoreans, e.g., the female is likened to the number two and\nthe male to the number three and their sum, five, is likened to\nmarriage (Aristotle, Fr. 203). \n\nWhat then was the nature of Pythagoras’ cosmos?  The doxographical\ntradition reports that Pythagoras discovered the sphericity of the\nearth, the five celestial zones and the identity of the evening and\nmorning star (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 48, Aetius III.14.1, Diogenes\nLaertius IX. 23). In each case, however, Burkert has shown that these\nreports seem to be false and the result of the glorification of\nPythagoras in the later tradition, since the earliest and most\nreliable evidence assigns these same discoveries to someone else\n(1972a, 303 ff.). Thus, Theophrastus, who is the primary basis of the\ndoxographical tradition, says that it was Parmenides who discovered\nthe sphericity of the earth (Diogenes Laertius VIII. 48). Parmenides\nis also identified as the discoverer of the identity of the morning\nand evening star (Diogenes Laertius IX. 23), and Pythagoras’ claim\nappears to be based on a poem forged in his name, which was rejected\nalready by Callimachus in the third century BCE (Burkert 1972a, 307).\nThe identification of the five celestial zones depends on the\ndiscovery of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and some of the doxography\nduly assigns this discovery to Pythagoras as well and claims that\nOenopides stole it from Pythagoras (Aetius II.12.2); the history of\nastronomy by Aristotle’s pupil Eudemus, our most reliable source,\nseems to attribute the discovery to Oenopides (there are problems with\nthe text), however (Eudemus, Fr. 145 Wehrli). It thus appears that the\nlater tradition, finding no evidence for Pythagoras’ cosmology in the\nearly evidence, assigned the discoveries of Parmenides back to\nPythagoras, encouraged by traditions which made Parmenides the pupil\nof Pythagoras. In the end, there is no evidence for Pythagoras’\ncosmology in the early evidence, beyond what can be reconstructed\nfrom acusmata. As was shown above, Pythagoras saw the cosmos\nas structured according to number insofar as the tetraktys is\nthe source of all wisdom. His cosmos was also imbued with a moral\nsignificance, which is in accordance with his beliefs about\nreincarnation and the fate of the soul (West 1971, 215–216; Huffman\n2013, 60–68). Thus, in answer to the question “What are the\nIsles of the Blest?” (where we might hope to go, if we lived a\ngood life), the answer is “the sun and the moon.” Again\n“the planets are the hounds of Persephone,” i.e., the\nplanets are agents of vengeance for wrong done (Aristotle in\nPorphyry VP 41). Aristotle similarly reports that for the\nPythagoreans thunder “is a threat to those in Tartarus, so that\nthey will be afraid” (Posterior Analytics 94b) and\nanother acusma says that “an earthquake is nothing\nother than a meeting of the dead” (Aelian, Historical\nMiscellany, IV. 17). Zhmud calls these\ncosmological acusmata into question (2012a, 329–330), noting\nthat some only appear in Porphyry, but Porphyry explicitly identifies\nAristotle as his source and we have no reason to doubt him\n(VP 41). Pythagoras’ cosmos embodied mathematical\nrelationships that had a basis in fact and combined them with moral\nideas tied to the fate of the soul. The best analogy for the type of\naccount of the cosmos which Pythagoras gave might be some of the myths\nwhich appear at the end of Platonic dialogues such as\nthe Phaedo,\nGorgias or Republic, where cosmology has a primarily\nmoral purpose.  Should the doctrine of the harmony of the spheres be\nassigned to Pythagoras? Certainly the acusma which talks of\nthe sirens singing in the harmony represented by the\ntetraktys suggests that there might have been a cosmic music\nand that Pythagoras may well have thought that the heavenly bodies,\nwhich we see move across the sky at night, made music by their\nmotions. On the other hand, there is no evidence for “the\nspheres,” if we mean by that a cosmic model according to which\neach of the heavenly bodies is associated with a series of concentric\ncircular orbits, a model which is at least in part designed to explain\ncelestical phenomena. The first such cosmic model in the Pythagorean\ntradition is that of Philolaus in the second half of the fifth\ncentury, a model which still shows traces of the connection to the\nmoral cosmos of Pythagoras in its account of the counter-earth and the\ncentral fire (see Philolaus). \n\nIf Pythagoras was primarily a figure of religious and ethical\nsignificance, who left behind an influential way of life and for whom\nnumber and cosmology primarily had significance in this religious and\nmoral context, how are we to explain the prominence of rigorous\nmathematics and mathematical cosmology in later Pythagoreans such as\nPhilolaus and Archytas? It is important to note that this is not just\na question asked by modern scholars but was already a central question\nin the fourth century BCE. What is the connection between Pythagoras\nand fifth-century Pythagoreans? The question is implicit in\nAristotle’s description of the fifth-century Pythagoreans such as\nPhilolaus as “the so-called Pythagoreans.” This expression\nis most easily understood as expressing Aristotle’s recognition that\nthese people were called Pythagoreans and at the same time his\npuzzlement as to what connection there could be between the\nwonder-worker who promulgated the acusmata, which his\nresearches show Pythagoras to have been, and the philosophy of\nlimiters and unlimiteds put forth in fifth-century Pythagoreanism. The\ntradition of a split between two groups of Pythagoreans in the fifth\ncentury, the mathematici and the acusmatici, points\nto the same puzzlement. The evidence for this split is quite confused\nin the later tradition, but Burkert (1972a, 192 ff.) has shown that\nthe original and most objective account of the split is found in a\npassage of Aristotle’s book on the Pythagoreans, which is preserved in\nIamblichus (On Common Mathematical Science, 76.19 ff). The\nacusmatici, who are clearly connected by their name to the\nacusmata, are recognized by the other group, the\nmathematici, as genuine Pythagoreans, but the\nacusmatici do not regard the philosophy of the\nmathematici as deriving from Pythagoras but rather from\nHippasus. The mathematici appear to have argued that, while\nthe acusmatici were indeed Pythagoreans, it was the\nmathematici who were the true Pythagoreans; Pythagoras gave\nthe acusmata to those who did not have the time to study the\nmathematical sciences, so that they would at least have moral\nguidance, while to those who had the time to fully devote themselves\nto Pythagoreanism he gave training in the mathematical sciences, which\nexplained the reasons for this guidance. This tradition thus shows\nthat all agreed that the acusmata represented the teaching of\nPythagoras, but that some regarded the mathematical work associated\nwith the mathematici as not deriving from Pythagoras himself,\nbut rather from Hippasus (on the controversy about the evidence for\nthis split into two groups of Pythagoreans see the fifth paragraph of\nsection 4.3 above). For fourth-century Greeks as for modern scholars,\nthe question is whether the mathematical and scientific side of later\nPythagoreanism derived from Pythagoras or not. If there were no\nintelligible way to understand how later Pythagoreanism could have\narisen out of the Pythagoreanism of the acusmata, the puzzle\nof Pythagoras’ relation to the later tradition would be insoluble. The\ncosmos of the acusmata, however, clearly shows a belief in a\nworld structured according to mathematics, and some of the evidence\nfor this belief may have been drawn from genuine mathematical truths\nsuch as those embodied in the “Pythagorean” theorem and\nthe relation of whole number ratios to musical concords. Even if\nPythagoras’ cosmos was of primarily moral and symbolic significance,\nthese strands of mathematical truth, which were woven into it, would\nprovide the seeds from which later Pythagoreanism grew. Philolaus’\ncosmos and his metaphysical system, in which all things arise from\nlimiters and unlimiteds and are known through numbers, are not stolen\nfrom Pythagoras. They embody a conception of mathematics, which owes\nmuch to the more rigorous mathematics of Hippocrates of Chios in the\nmiddle of the fifth century; the contrast between limiter and\nunlimited makes most sense after Parmenides’ emphasis on the role of\nlimit in the first part of the fifth century. Philolaus’ system is\nnonetheless an intelligible development of the reverence for\nmathematical truth found in Pythagoras’ own cosmological scheme, which\nis embodied in the acusmata. \n\nThe picture of Pythagoras presented above is inevitably based on\ncrucial decisions about sources and has been recently challenged in a\nsearching critique (Zhmud 2012a). Zhmud argues that the consensus view\nof Pythagoras’ cosmos as presented above is based on the faulty\nassumption that there was a progression from myth and religion to\nreason and science in Pythagoreanism. In many cases, he argues, the\nevidence suggests that early Pythagoreanism was more scientific and\nthat religious and mythic elements only gained in importance in the\nlater tradition. The consensus picture of Pythagoras’ cosmos assigns\nnumber symbolism a central role and treats the tetraktys, the\nfirst four numbers, which total to the perfect number ten, as a\ncentral concept. Zhmud argues that the tetraktys and the\nimportance of the number ten do not go back to Pythagoras but flourish\nin the Neopythagorean tradition, while having roots in number\nspeculation in the Academy associated with such figures as Plato’s\nsuccessor Speusippus. One of the central pieces of evidence for this\nview is that the tetraktys does not first appear until late\nin the tradition, in Aetius in the first century CE (DK\n1.3.8). However, the tetraktys does appear in one of\nthe acusmata in a section (82) of Iamblichus’ On the\nPythagorean Life that is commonly regarded as deriving from\nAristotle. Zhmud himself agrees that sections 82–86 of On the\nPythagorean Life as a whole go back to Aristotle but suggests\nthat the acusma about the tetraktys was a post-Aristotelian\naddition (2012a, 300–303). Once again source criticism is crucial. If\nthe acusma in question goes back to Aristotle then there is\ngood evidence for the tetraktys in early Pythagoreanism. If\nwe regard it as a later insertion into Aristotelian material, the\nearly Pythagorean credentials of the tetraktys are less\nclear.   \n\nZhmud supports Pythagoras’ position as genuine mathematician rather\nthan someone interested only in number symbolism by pointing to gaps\nin the development of early Greek mathematics. Although there is no\nexplicit evidence, Pythagoras is the most likely candidate to fill\nthese gaps. Thus between Thales, whom Eudemus identifies as the first\ngeometer, and Hippocrates of Chios, who produced the\nfirst Elements, someone turned geometry into a deductive\nscience (Zhmud 2012a, 256). Similarly, Hippasus’ experiment with\nbronze disks to show that the concordant intervals of the octave,\nfifth and fourth were governed by whole number ratios is too complex\nto be a first attempt so that once again someone must have discovered\nthe ratios in a simpler way earlier (Zhmud 2012a, 291). In each case\nZhmud suggests that Pythagoras is that someone. Finally, the study of\nproportion ties together airthmetic, geometry and harmonics and Zhmud\nargues that, although there is no explicit fourth-century evidence,\nlater reports which assign Pythagoras the discovery of the first three\nproportions (Iamblichus, Commentary on Nicomachus’ Introduction to\nArithmetic 100.19–101.11) are likely to go back to Eudemus\n(2012a, 265–266). Such speculations have some plausibility but they\nhighlight even more the puzzle as to why, if Pythagoras played this\ncentral role in early Greek mathematics, no early source explicitly\nascribes it to him. Of course, some scholars argue that the majority\nhave overlooked key passages that do assign mathematical achievements\nto Pythagoras. In order to gain a rounded view of the Pythagorean\nquestion it is thus appropriate to look at the most controversial of\nthese passages. \n\nSome scholars who regard Pythagoras as a mathematician and rational\ncosmologist, such as Guthrie, admit that the earliest evidence does\nnot support this view (Lloyd 2014, 25), but maintain that the\nprominence of Pythagoras the mathematician in the late tradition must\nbe based on something early. Others maintain that there is evidence in\nthe sixth- and fifth-century BCE for Pythagoras as a mathematician and\ncosmologist. They argue that Herodotus’ reference to Pythagoras as a\nwise man (sophistês) and Heraclitus’ description of him\nas pursuing inquiry (historiê), show that he was\nregarded as practicing rational cosmology (Kahn 2002, 16–17;\nZhmud 2012a, 33–43). The concept of a wise man in Herodotus’\ntime was very broad, however, and includes poets and sages as well as\nIonian cosmologists; the same is true of the concept of\ninquiry. Historiê peri physeos (inquiry concerning\nnature) is later used to refer specifically to the inquiry into nature\npracticed by the Presocratic cosmologists, but Herodotus’ usage shows\nthat at Heraclitus’ time historiê referred to inquiry\nin a quite general sense and has no specific reference to the\ncosmological inquiry of the Presocratics (Huffman 2008b). In one\ninstance in Herodotus it refers to inquiry into the stories of\nMenelaus’ and Helen’s adventures in Egypt (II. 118). Heraclitus may be\nthinking of Pythagoras’ inquiry into and collection of the mythical\nand religious lore that is found in the acusmata (Huffman\n2008b; see also Gemelli Marciano 2002, 96–103). Thus the\ndescription of Pythagoras as a wise man who practiced inquiry is\nsimply too general to aid in deciding what sort of figure Herodotus\nand Heraclitus saw him as being. It is certainly true that Empedocles\nshows that the roles of rational cosmologist and wonder-working\nreligious teacher could be combined in one figure, but this\ndoes not prove these roles were combined in Pythagoras’ case. The only\nthing that could prove this in Pythagoras’ case is reliable early\nevidence for a rational cosmology and that is precisely what is\nlacking. \n\nThere is more controversy about the fourth-century evidence. Zhmud\nargues that Isocrates regards Pythagoras as a philosopher and\nmathematician (2012a, 50). However, it is hard to see how the passage\nin question (Busiris 28–29) supports this view. Nowhere in it\ndoes Isocrates ascribe mathematical work or a rational cosmology to\nPythagoras. He reports in general terms that Pythagoras brought\n“ other philosophy” to Greece from Egypt but what he\nemphasizes is that Pythagoras was “more clearly interested than\nothers in sacrificial rites and temple rituals.” It is true that\nearlier, in a passage that does not mention Pythagoras\n(Busiris 22–23), Isocrates had said that some of the Egyptian\npriests studied mathematics but if Isocrates thought Pythagoras also\nbrought mathematical learning from Egypt he has chosen not to say so\nexplicitly. What Isocrates emphasizes about Pythagoras is what the\nrest of the early tradition emphasizes, his interest in religious\nrites. Fr. 191 from Aristotle’s lost work on the Pythagoreans reports\nthat Pythagoras “dedicated himself to the study of mathematical\nsciences, especially numbers” and Fragment 20 from\nAristotle’s Proptrepticus says that Pythagoras said that\nhuman beings were born to contemplate the heavens and described\nhimself as an observor of nature (Zhmud 2012a, 56 and\n259–260). Unfortunately, in neither case are the words in question\nlikely to be Aristotle’s. Fr. 191 comes from a book on marvels by\nApollonius (2nd BCE?). The words in question come before Apollonius\nmentions Aristotle and, as Burkert pointed out (1972a, 412), are\noverwhelming likely to be by Apollonius himself, since they serve as\nthe transition sentence between Apollonius’ account of Pherecydes and\nhis account of Pythagoras. In the face of the huge extant corpus of\nAristotle’s works in which he never ascribes any mathematical work to\nPythagoras, a single sentence that is not ascribed directly to\nAristotle and that, in terms of function, appears to be the work of\nApollonius and not Aristotle cannot with any confidence be used as\nevidence that Aristotle regarded Pythagoras as a mathematician. The\nsame situation arises with Fr. 20 of the Protrepticus. If the\nwords in question were by Aristotle they would be his sole statement\nthat Pythagoras was a natural philosopher. The case of Fr. 20 is even\nmore tenuous than that of Fr. 191. Fr. 20 comes from\nIamblichus’ Protrepticus, large parts of which are likely to\nderive from Aristotle’s lost Protrepticus but, as is his\npractice, Iamblichus does not make any explicit reference to\nAristotle. The further problem with Fr. 20, as Burkert noted (1960,\n166–168), is that the same story is told first about Pythagoras and\nthen immediately afterwards about Anaxagoras: both are asked why human\nbeings were born and both answer “to contemplate the\nheavens” (Iamblichus, Protrepticus 51.8–15). This\nawkward repetition of the same story about two different people\nimmediately suggests that only one story was in the original and the\nother was added in the later tradition. This suggestion is strikingly\nconfirmed by the fact that Aristotle does tell this story about\nAnaxagoras in his extant works (Eudemian Ethics 1216a11–16)\nbut not about Pythagoras. Thus, if the passage in\nIamblichus’ Protrepticus is, in fact, from Aristotle, it is\nvery likely that only Anaxagoras appeared in Aristotle’s version and\nthat Pythagoras was added in the later tradition, perhaps by\nIamblichus himself. Since these two passages are unlikely to be from\nAristotle, there are no references to Pythagoras as a mathematician or\nas a natural philosopher either in Aristotle’s extant works or in the\nfragments of his works. Aristotle only knows Pythagoras as a wonder\nworking sage and teacher of a way of life (Fr. 191). Aristotle’s\nattitude is similar to his predecessors in the earlier fourth century:\nPlato’s sole reference to Pythagoras is as the founder of a way of\nlife and Isocrates emphasizes both the way of life and the interest in\nreligious ritual. \n\nWhat about the pupils of Plato and Aristotle? As discussed in the\nsecond paragraph of section 5 above, Eudemus, who wrote a series of\nhistories of mathematics never mentions Pythagoras by name. Arguments\nfrom silence are perilous but, when the most well-informed source of\nthe fourth-century fails to mention Pythagoras in works explicitly\ndirected towards the history of mathematics, the silence means\nsomething. There are only two passages in which Pythagoras is\nexplicitly associated with anything mathematical or scientific by\npupils of Plato and Aristotle. First, Aristotle’s pupil Aristoxenus\nreports that Pythagoras “most of all valued the pursuit\n(pragmateia) of number and brought it forward, taking it away\nfrom the use of traders, by likening all things to numbers”\n(Fr. 23). Zhmud translates  pragmateia as\n“science” (2012a, 216) so that he has Aristoxenus\nattributing the invention of the science of number to Pythagoras but,\nwhile Aristoxenus does use pragmateia to mean science in some\ncontexts, it more commonly simply means “pursuit” (Huffman\n2014b, 292). Here surely it must mean “pursuit,” because\nPythagoras is presented as taking it away from the traders and we can\nhardly suppose that the traders were engaged in the theoretical\nscience of arithmetic. Moreover, Aristoxenus explains what he means in\nthe final participial phrase. He is not ascribing rigorous mathematics\nwith proofs to Pythagoras but rather says that Pythagoras was\n“likening all things to numbers”. This is consistent with\nthe moralized cosmos of Pythagoras sketched above in which numbers\nhave symbolic significance. The second important passage is Plato’s\npupil Xenocrates’ assertion that Pythagoras “discovered that the\nintervals in music, too, do not arise in separation from number”\n(Fr. 9). Xenocrates is being quoted here in a fragment of a work by a\nHeraclides (Barker 1989, 235–236), perhaps Heraclides of Pontus. There\nis controversy whether the quotation of Xenocrates is limited just to\nwhat has been quoted in the previous sentence or whether the whole\nfragment of Heraclides is a quotation of Xenocrates. Burkert (1972a,\n381) and Barker (1989, 235) argue that it is probably just the first\nsentence that Heraclides ascribes to Xenocrates, while Zhmud would\ninclude at least a second sentence in which Heraclides presents\nPythagoras as pursuing a program of research into “the\nconditions under which concordant and discordant intervals\narise” (Zhmud 2012a, 258). If the second sentence is accepted\nthen Xenocrates clearly presents Pythagoras as an acoustic\nscientist. It seems most reasonable, however, to accept only the first\nsentence as belonging to Xenocrates. If the quotation from Xenocrates\ndoes not break off at that point, there is no other obvious breaking\npoint in the fragment and the whole two pages of text must be ascribed\nto Xenocrates. The problem with ascribing it all to Xenocrates is that\nPorphyry introduces the passage as a quotation from Heraclides, which\nwould be strange if everything quoted, in fact, belongs to\nXenocrates. If just the first sentence comes from Xenocrates, then all\nhe is ascribing to Pythagoras is the recognition that the concordant\nintervals are connected to numbers. It is easy to assume, as Zhmud\ndoes, that Xenocrates is saying that Pythagoras was the first\nto discover that the concordant intervals are governed by whole number\nratios but Xenocrates’ remarks need not mean this. Xenocrates’\ncomments might well come from a context like that in the fragment of\nAristoxenus, above, i.e., a context in which Pythagoras is presented\nas likening all things to numbers and arguing that numbers in some\nsense explain or control things. In such a context Xenocrates would\nnot be making the point that Pythagoras discovered the whole number\nratios but rather that he found out that concords arose in accordance\nwith whole number ratios, perhaps from musicians (who discovered them\nfirst not being the issue), and used this fact as another illustration\nof how things are like numbers. Thus, the fragments of Aristoxenus and\nXeoncrates show that Pythagoras likened things to numbers and took the\nconcordant musical intervals as a central example, but do not suggest\nthat he founded arithmetic as a rigorous mathematical discipline or\ncarried out a program of scientific research in harmonics. \n\nControversy concerning Pythagoras’ role as a scientist and\nmathematician will continue. Indeed, Hahn has recently endorsed many\nof Zhmud’s arguments and argues that Pythagoras was a rational\ncosmologist, who was further developing a project begun by Thales to\ncontruct the cosmos out of right triangles. Hahn admits, however, that\nhis thesis is “speculative” and “a circumstantial\ncase at best” (2017:xi). It should now be clear that decisions\nabout sources are crucial in addressing the question of whether\nPythagoras was a mathematician and scientist. The view of\nPythagoras’ cosmos sketched in the first five paragraphs of this\nsection, according to which he was neither a mathematician nor a\nscientist, remains the consensus.
