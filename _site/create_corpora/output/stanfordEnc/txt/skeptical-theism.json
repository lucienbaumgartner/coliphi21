Though these strategies are presented in roughly historical\norder, each strategy is still embodied in ongoing conversations in the\nphilosophical literature. \n\n\n\nThis section sketches the argument from evil and the skeptical\ntheist's skepticism (or, sometimes, “agnosticism,” as in\nAlston (1996, 98) Howard-Snyder (2009, 18)).  \nWe will say that an evil, E, is “pointless” or\n“unjustified” if and only if there is no\nall-things-considered sufficient reason for God to allow it (not even\na non-specific or indirect reason, such as that E occurred by\nchance as a result of a random process that God saw that it was best\nto allow). One standard kind of sufficient reason to allow an\nevil, E, would be a great enough good, G, such that it\nis permissible for God to allow (or risk allowing) E\nand G to occur. Further, E's occurring makes\nsufficiently probable the occurrence of G, and E\nand G is more valuable than ~E and ~G. Another\nstandard kind of reason considered in the literature for\nallowing E is that allowing E (or something equally bad\nor worse) to occur is logically necessary for achieving some greater\ngood G or the avoiding of some equally bad or worse evil.  Such\ngoods can be conceived to exist whether or not there is a God, so the\nexistence of pointless evils is, as far as anything said thus far\ngoes, consistent with atheism. These terms are intended to be\nunderstood so that a bad state of affairs can be pointless or\nunjustified for a God whether or not there is a God.   \n\nSince on the present notion of pointlessness, the existence of\nunjustified evil is not compatible with the existence of\nGod–that is, no possible world contains both God and unjustified\nevil–we can set forth a very simple template for an idealized,\ngeneralized argument from evil that can take many forms when fleshed\nout to various degrees in various ways. Theological Premise: Necessarily, if there is a\nGod, there are no pointless evils. Empirical Premise: There are pointless evils. Conclusion: There is no God. \n\nThere are two main ways the empirical premise can be justified.\nFirst, it could be an inference from the obvious existence\nof inscrutable evils. Inscrutable evils are evils such that\none can discern no sufficient reason for allowing them, even after\ncareful examination. This is like a sampling argument: no observed\ngoods have been good enough to justify certain evils, so probably no\nevil at all is. Second, it could be defended by reference to\nparticular examples of evil, especially very terrible evils, where it\njust seems obvious the evils are unjustified. The version of the\nargument from evil which has received the most attention is that of\nWilliam Rowe (1979, 1988, 1991, 1995, 1996, 2006; see also Trakakis\n2007), who offered the sampling argument from evil. The four principal\nforms of skeptical theism below were formulated primarily in response\nto Rowe's arguments. Whether they can be extended to other arguments\nlike that of Draper (1989/1996) or Tooley (Tooley and Plantinga 2008)\nor Dougherty (2008) will be briefly discussed in Section 6 of this\narticle. \n\nRowe's main line of defense for the empirical premise is the existence\nof evils which seem pointless (inscrutable\nevils). Seeming pointless has at times been interpreted as a direct\ninsight and at other times as resulting from an inference (Rowe 1979\nand the early literature treats it both ways). A fair way to represent\nthe inference is as a kind of simple induction of the sampling variety\nconcerning some given terrible evil E.  Premise: All possible reasons examined for allowing E\nso far have turned out to be insufficient to justify God permitting\nthem. Conclusion: There is no justification for E. \n\nThe Empirical Premise is just an existential generalization of this\nconclusion. This is an example of a kind of inference that has come to\nbe called the “Noseeum Inference” after the bugs in the\nMidwest which are so small one never seems to find them in one's tent,\neven when one knows they're there (Wykstra 1996). Here is why that\nname has been applied. Skeptical theists point out that absence of\nevidence is not always evidence of absence. Some entities are such\nthat their presence is expected to be detected, others their presence\nis not expected to be detected. If there were a grizzly bear in one's\ncamp, one expects to find it, so not seeing one is evidence one is not\nthere. But it is otherwise with small bugs. One's not seeing them in\none's camp is not good evidence that they are not there. Below, much\nattention will be focused on reasons to think that God's reasons\nshould be detected. \nIn the above Premise, E can be filled in with a particular\nevil, a set of evils, or it could be used as a name to refer to some\nkind of organic sum of all evil (if there is such a thing) to make the\npoint that what we can't see a reason for is the general pattern of\nevil we observe in the world: its magnitude, duration, and\ndistribution. There is considerable room for flexibility and\ncreativity when fleshing out the details of this argument along a\nparticular strategic line. Thus, if skeptical theism is to be fully\nsuccessful, it must be made applicable to each variety of the problem\nof evil.  \n\nSkepticisms of all kinds come in varying degrees. The skepticism of\nmost skeptical theists seems total or near total.  That is, they tend\nto accept the No Weight Thesis. \n\nThat is, observations of evil do not even attain the status of\nevidence (van Inwagen 1995, 94–5). Van Inwagen founds his\nskeptical theism on his “extreme modal and moral\nskepticism” (skepticism about our ability to discern the\nrelevant truths about morality and possibility, not skepticism about\nwhether there are such truths; 1995, 84) and goes on to assert\n(repeatedly) that we have “no reason” to accept what he\ntakes to be the crucial premise of the evidential argument from\nevil. Indeed, he thinks that owing to the truth of his skeptical\ntheses “the evidential argument from evil cannot get\nstarted” (1995, 85).  \n\nAlston is not quite as explicit, but seems to agree. He calls the\nposition he defends “agnosticism” (1996, 98). He says that\nour cognitive resources are “radically insufficient to provide\nsufficient warrant to accepting [the main premise of the evidential\nargument],” so much so that “the inductive argument\ncollapses” (98). He concludes that “the inductive argument\nfrom evil is in no better shape than its late lamented deductive\ncousin” (121). It is generally accepted that the deductive\nargument, sometimes called the “logical problem”, is\na complete failure, and by calling it “late”\nAlston seems to agree.  \n\nWykstra backs off his 1984 claims (1984: 74, 79, 80, 90–91) that\nevil provides no evidence for atheism. He now calls those claims\n“reckless” (1996, 148 n. 14). He now admits that the\nevidence from evil, bracketing evidence for God's existence,\n“tilts” in favor (rather significantly, 1996, 138) of\natheism, but not enough to justify belief in atheism, even if one\nstarts from agnosticism.  \n\nBergmann seems clearly to advance No Weight. He also often says we\nhave “no reason” to think the goods we are aware of are\nrepresentative of the goods there are (2001: 288, 289 (three\ntimes)). Three times in his 2001 and throughout his 2008 he uses the\nphrase “in the dark” for our cognitive situation with\nrespect to God-justifying reasons. And Bergmann and Rea (2005,\nesp. 248) seem to indicate that they accept that we cannot\nassign any probability what so ever to the relevant class of\npropositions about goods (a thesis also endorsed by van Inwagen 1995,\n75).  \n\nBergman's commitment to No Weight can further be seen in his\nendorsement of another thesis, the Non-starter Thesis. \n\nA prima facie reason here is, roughly, one that could be\noverturned upon further considerations. It is also sometimes called a\n“defeasible” reason because it can be defeated by further\nconsiderations. One might think that evil provided a\nprima facie reason for atheism that skeptical theism was\ndesigned to defeat. However, this is not how Bergmann thinks of\nthe situation. Swinburne (1998, 13) explains skeptical theism\nthis way, but Bergmann corrects him. \n\nBergmann goes on to say that the skeptical theist's response is:  This seems a perfectly clear commitment to Non-starter and so to\nNo Weight. Thus we see that in general, the skeptical theist's\nskepticism is of a very high degree concerning its target: our ability\nto have knowledge of the kinds of possibilities – especially\nmoral possibilities – required to get the argument from evil\nstarted.  \n\nThe earliest major approach in the contemporary literature to bringing\ncognitive limits to bear upon the argument from evil is the epistemic\nprinciples approach, inaugurated by Wykstra (1984, but see also Alston\n1996/1991, 122, n11 in Howard-Snyder 1996b). He has continued to\ndefend and expand this strategy to the present day (Russell and\nWykstra 1988, Wykstra 1996, 2007, 2009, and Wykstra and Perrine 2012\nand forthcoming). Howard-Snyder 2009 makes a similar but more detailed\nreply based on a similar but importantly different epistemic\nprinciple. Plantinga (1988) also touches on the topic. (Some of what\nfollows follows Dougherty 2011c.) \n\nThe argument from evil is meant to use evidence about evil in the\nworld to support the proposition that there is no God. Thus, one\nnatural line of reply to that argument is to show that some applicable\ngeneral principle about evidential support is not satisfied in the\ncase of evil and theism. Wykstra proposes just such a principle in his\nCondition Of ReasoNable Epistemic Access. Wykstra and Perrine (2012) also offer a probabilistic version of\nCORNEA to address a counterexample in McBrayer (2009). \n\nSee Rowe (1996, 270ff) for treatment of interpretive issues concerning\nCORNEA. Wykstra notes that: It becomes clear in Wykstra's dialogue with Russell (Russell and\nWykstra 1988), that the key notion operating behind CORNEA is that the\nhypothesis that God exists predicts that reasons for suffering would\nnot be transparent to the human observer but, rather, obscure.\nTherefore we may focus on the following principle. \n\nIf Obscurity is true, it provides good reason to doubt justification\naccrued via a common sense epistemic principle, the Principle of\nCredulity (Swinburne 1998 states the problem of evil in terms of this\nprinciple, Swinburne 2001 explicates and defends the principle). \n\nor a weaker principle of Reasons Commonsensism: \n\nGiven RC, the reason S has for p is a consideration\nwhich has some positive weight in favor of p which could\npotentially be outweighed by contrary reasons. PC or RC or some such\nprinciple can be used for direct support of the Empirical Premise\n(this is how Swinburne 1998 sets up the problem). Obscurity's truth\nwould be the “further consideration” showing that the\nseeming-that-p could not be trusted. \n\nWykstra defends Obscurity, or things that support Obscurity,\nprincipally via the Parent Analogy. \n\nWykstra has repeatedly appealed to the parent analogy (1984, 88;\nRussell and Wykstra 1988, 135, 144, 146; 1996, 139ff) in defense of\nObscurity (See Dougherty 2011 for a reply). At first, it seems to be a\ncommon sense response to the argument from evil quite consonant with\nwhat we would expect the average person to say. As we shall see, there\nis reason to think the appearance may be deceiving.  \nHoward-Snyder's principle (H-S) is importantly different.  \n\nRecall that Wykstra's principle requires that one have good\nreason for thinking x's would be apparent.\nHoward-Snyder's only requires that one not be in doubt, or\nperhaps, better, not have particular grounds for doubt, about their\nseeability. If some basic beliefs are prima facie justified, that is,\njustified until there is reason to doubt them, without explicit\nreasons, then skepticism will be more of a threat with Wykstra's\nepistemic principle than with Howard-Snyder's. Note that the truth of\nObscurity will also work with Howard-Snyder's principle, so a defense\nof the parent analogy would also serve Howard-Snyder's case.  \n\nHoward-Snyder adds two arguments to the defense of Obscurity.  First,\nhe offers the Progress Argument (1996, 301). The gist of the argument\nis that there has been significant progress in knowledge and\nunderstanding of moral truths, including knowledge of what intrinsic\ngoods there are, in the past, and there is no good reason to think\nthis trend is at an end. But if so, it follows that we are now\nignorant concerning certain intrinsic goods. And for all we know these\nmight include the goods for the sake of which God permits evil. He\ncombines this with the Argument from Complexity (1996, 301). This\nargument begins by recalling that the data from which the strongest\narguments from evil start are the profusion or seeming excess of evil\nin the world which, indeed, seems to be integrated into the fabric of\nnature and society. But for that very reason (their complexity and\nintricacy), any complex good whole of which these evils are a part\nwould have to be exceedingly complex. Thus, he infers that it\nwould not be surprising if it were beyond our ability to fathom.  \n\nResisting the epistemic principles strategy involves arguing for one\nof two claims: either that the epistemic principle employed is false\n(or inapplicable) or that the condition it imposes is in fact\nmet. Both of these kinds of objections have been leveled at the\nepistemic principles strategy.  \n\nTwo kinds of arguments have been suggested to show that CORNEA is\nfalse. Some (Laraudogoitia 2000; Graham and Maitzen 2007) have argued\nthat CORNEA violates a plausible closure principle.  Closure\nprinciples are a family of principles stating that when a proposition\nhas some form of positive epistemic status, knowledge, say, and bears\nsome relevant relation to some other proposition, logically entailing\nit, say, then that second proposition has the same epistemic status as\nthe first. A principle popular among friends of closure is the\nfollowing: If one knows p and competently deduces q\nfrom p while retaining knowledge of p, and one comes to\nbelieve q on that basis, then one knows q. These authors\nargue that, if skeptical theism were true, then an intuitively\nplausible closure principle would be false.  Others (Russell 1988;\nMcBrayer 2009) have also argued that CORNEA is false on the grounds\nthat it implies skepticism. The following two sections offer some\ndetail for each of these claims. \n\nLaraudogoitia (2000) accuses CORNEA of backfiring by overlooking a\nfact about closure. The skeptical theist argues that CORNEA entails\nthat the justified attitude concerning whether there are pointless\nevils is agnosticism. But the theist thinks it is reasonable to\nbelieve in God, and she knows that if God exists, then there is no\ngratuitous evil. And the following closure principle will hold for\nnormal theists in normal circumstances.  From this principle – together with the theist's theism and\nknowledge about the relevant entailment – it follows that the\ntheist is justified in believing there is no gratuitous evil. But this\ncontradicts the agnosticism dictated by CORNEA.  \n\nGraham and Maitzen (2007) note CORNEA's resemblance to some principles\nfrom elsewhere in epistemology. They seek to bring objections to those\nprinciples to bear on CORNEA. The principles are Nozick's\n“sensitivity” condition on knowledge and Dretske's similar\naccount involving conclusive reasons. Nozick's sensitivity condition\non knowledge is roughly that you know only if, were p false,\nyou wouldn't believe\np. Dretske's account is, approximately, you know p if you have a conclusive\nreason R for p, one such that were p not true you\nwould not have R (and/or R would not be true, details\nvary). One of the main objections to those theories is that they\nviolate almost any plausible closure principle on knowledge. The\nclosure principle in question is, essentially, this one. \n\nThey argue that, like the principles of Nozick and Dretske, the\napplication of this principle to some cases is incompatible with\nCORNEA. \n\nRussell (1988, 148; 1996) notes that CORNEA seems to open the door to\nsomething like Cartesian skepticism. Recall the condition CORNEA puts\nin place, the thing it says one needs a reason to believe: if p were\nnot the case, s would likely be different than it is in some\nway discernible by her. Now consider the following possibility: you\nare a brain being kept alive in a vat of nutrients and stimulated in a\nway that causes your current experiences and memory impressions. Let p\nbe I am not a brain in a vat, indexed to you, and consider\nwhether you have reason to think things would look different for you\nif that were false, that is, if you were a brain in a\nvat. Ex hypothesi, they would not. So CORNEA seems to lead\nquickly to the skeptical conclusion that we do not know that we are\nnot mere brains in vats. McBrayer (2009) expands at length on this,\nmaking the argument in more detail, also incorporating analogies to\nthe epistemology of Nozick and Dretske.  \n\nSome proponents of the argument from evil have provided some reason to\nthink that in fact the condition that CORNEA imposes can be met. That\nis, they provide some reason to think that if there were a God, then\nlikely things would be different. That is, they offer reasons\nto think that if there were a God, then we would see more of the\nreasons for why evils are allowed. In short, they offer reasons to\nthink Obscurity false. Russell (1988, 147ff) and Rowe (2001, 298;\n1996, 274–276; 2006, 89) both advance a parental analogy on\nbehalf of the negation of Obscurity and Dougherty (2011b) has\nexpanded upon these arguments. The problem is that whereas the Parent\nAnalogy (PA) takes into account God's boundless\nknowledge, it fails to give due to his boundless power and\nlove. Thus Russell, Rowe, and Dougherty defend a reverse\nparent analogy (PA+), which is an extension of the parent analogy. \n\nThe reverse parent analogy seems to be stronger than PA because it\nappeals to a more robust picture of God's attributes, and it supports\nthe negation of Obscurity. We can call that thesis Transparency. \n\nThis section considers brief replies to the above objections. \n\nWykstra (2007) replies to the closure problem by highlighting aspects\nof CORNEA that suggest a way to avoid the problem.  Wykstra notes\n(2007, 91) that in his original formulation he made a distinction that\nis the crux of his response to Graham and Maitzen. The distinction in\nquestion is – or is relevantly related to – Rudolf\nCarnap's distinction between “incremental” confirmation\nand “absolute” confirmation or what Wykstra calls\n“dynamic” and “static” support. An item of\nevidence E gives dynamic support to a target\nproposition p when it gives p an additional increment or\n“boost” of probability. Obviously, this is consistent\nwith p remaining very improbable on balance with respect to a\nset of total evidence. A total body of\nevidence E statically supports a target\nproposition p when p is more likely than not,\ngiven E. \n\nWykstra points out that he can accept closure. He can accept, for\ninstance, the implication of closure that S's knowing that she\nsees a zebra and that being a zebra excludes being a disguised mule\nentails that S is in a position to know that she is not looking\nat a cleverly disguised mule while at the same time denying\nthat the very same evidence E whereby S comes to be\njustified in believing there's a zebra can, by itself, justify\n– or even boost the probability of – the proposition that\nit's not a cleverly disguised mule. \n\nFurthermore, Rowe is clear that he is setting aside the evidence for\ntheism for the sake of argument and only claiming that the individual\nevidential contribution of evil was to lower the probability of theism\n(and thus tilt toward atheism for the agnostic). Since Rowe isn't\nconsidering all the evidence relevant to theism, he is only interested\nin what Wykstra calls dynamic support. If we were to consider all our\nevidence, we could, in principle, find that the balance of our total\nevidence supports theism, and infer from the truth of theism that\nthere is no pointless evil. He calls this move from theism to the\ndenial of pointless evil the “Moorean Shift” (1996\n(orig. 1979), 6–8) after Moore's curt reply to the skeptic. The\nskeptical theist can consistently push CORNEA\nand the Moorean shift, because she only argues that CORNEA\nblocks the inductive inference to the conclusion that there is no justification for some evil (which is a case of alleged dynamic support), not that one's all-things-considered\nattitude toward pointless evil ought to be agnosticism (which would be\na case of static support). \n\nBoth Russell's and McBrayer's objections alleging skeptical\nimplications of CORNEA depend on interpreting CORNEA as a\ncounterfactual conditional, that is, a subjunctive conditional with a\nfalse antecedent. Though this is a natural interpretation, it has been\nresisted by Wykstra and Perrine (2011, forthcoming). According to\nstandard principles of common sense defeasible reasoning, if it\nappears to one that p, then one thereby has some reason\nfor p, though this reason can be outweighed in the end. Thus\nthe defender of the epistemic principles approach could grant that the\nadvocate of the argument from evil has defeasible reasons for atheism,\nbut add that the rational force of these reasons is neutralized by\nObscurity, which appears to be the core of CORNEA. This still leaves\nthe debate over Obscurity in place, but it plausibly avoids the\nskeptical objections to which CORNEA has been subjected.  \n\nBoth proponents and opponents of the argument from evil have claimed\nthe parent analogy. In response to the reverse parent analogy,\nhowever, note an important structural feature of the problem of evil.\nWhen a hypothesis H makes very probably that an event E will occur and\nE does not occur, E's not occurring clearly disconfirms H.  And if H\nmakes very probable that E will occur and E does occur, E's occurring\nclearly confirms H.  If H doesn't make E's occurring very probable or\nimprobable--that is, H and E are nearly probabilistically\nindependent--then neither E's occurring nor E's not occurring makes a\nclear difference to the probability of H.  \n\nSo, theism will be disconfirmed by our inability to discover reasons\nfor the evils we observe only if theism predicts with significant\nstrength that we should be able to detect the reasons.  Thus Rowe\n(1991) says,  \n\nFurther, in replying to the reverse parent analogy the theist can\nbring to bear on it reasons for divine hiddenness. As should be clear\nat this point, the problem of evil leads quite naturally to the\nproblem of divine silence/hiddenness. Thus, if there were good reasons\nfor God to veil himself in some way, to provide some “epistemic\ndistance” between himself and the casual observer, then these\nreasons could plausibly be used to defend Obscurity. For let R\nbe the reasons in question. The probability that we are unaware of the\nreasons for so much suffering, given theism, might be low, but the\nprobability that we are unaware of the reasons for so much suffering,\ngiven theism and R, could still be high. Of course, if the\nprobability of R, given theism, is high, then we might have\nfound out upon reflection that the first value isn't low after\nall. \nAlston's approach (1996a/1991) examines particular details involved in\nthe inference from inscrutable to pointless evil. He points to a\ncluster of limitations, some of which clearly generalize beyond the\nnoseeum inference.  \n\nAlston lists six disadvantages we face in discerning whether there are\npointless evils from the fact of inscrutable evils (1996b, 120). This\nlist will be referred to as The\nInventory. \n\nThese difficulties can be put to use in this argument. \n\nThere has been little doubt expressed that we are subject to the\ndifficulties in The Inventory, at least to a considerable degree, so\nPremise 1 seems to be secure.  The question, then, is whether our\nbeing subject to those limitations makes us completely unable to make\nthe inference from inscrutable evils to pointless evils with\njustification. One way to think of the objection is that this\ninference falls under a kind such that we are unjustified when making\ninferences in those circumstances.  \n\nTo be perfectly relevant, we would need to add to this argument the\nlemma that if one makes an unjustified inference, the conclusion of\nthat inference has low epistemic probability. This may be questioned,\nbut it is very plausible and discussion of it would take us too far\nafield.  \n\nThe first thing to say in objection to the multiple limitations\napproach is that each item in The Inventory seems to raise a problem\nfor theism itself. That is, each item is itself a bad state of affairs\nthat may seem surprising given theism (this is an expansion upon\nDougherty 2011b). One way to see this is to recall the reverse parent\nanalogy from §2.2.2 above. It is bad that we lack data relevant\nto a very important matter. After all, many people seem to lose their\nfaith (eternal salvation?) as a result of evil. It is bad that we lack\nthe processing power to come to an extremely important decision\n(whether there is a God). (Quick objection: Isn't it a good, though,\nto have to work to discover important truths?  Quick reply: Sometimes\nyes, sometimes no; plausibly not in the case of something this grave\nwhich applies to each person individually.)  It is a bad thing that we\ndon't know the outcome space of an important matter and can't tell,\nfor particular proposals, whether they are on it.  \n\nSo it might be considered a very odd strategy to try to answer an\nargument from evil by adverting to further bad states of affairs,\nwhich are not what we would expect from theism in the first\nplace.  \n\nOne kind of reply to the objection given is to argue that the objector\nhas taken the data of the argument from evil – typically\nhorrendous evils – and replaced them with some relatively minor\nevils. Expected or not, these minor evils would not make much of a\ncase against the existence of God. Now either Alston's argument works\nor it does not. That is, either it does or does not show that we are\nin no position to infer that there are pointless evils from the fact\nthat there are gratuitous evils. If the argument is successful--which\ndoesn't seem to be challenged by the objection--then the usual data of\nhorrendous evil cannot serve as a good foundation of an argument from\nevil. Thus we would be left with the evils on The Inventory, which are\nnot likely to dramatically reduce credence in theism for many. (For\nfurther thought: Let Inventory be the proposition that we are subject\nto the limitations mentioned on The Inventory. One might think the\nprobability of Inventory, given theism, is very low, so that\nprobability of theism is approximately equal to the probability of\ntheism & ~Inventory. This would make relevant the probability of\ninscrutable but not pointless evils, given theism & ~Inventory,\nwhich might plausibly be thought very low.)  This is plausibly the\nmaterial for a rejoinder by the advocate of the argument from\nevil. \n\nPeter van Inwagen has long defended a form of \"modal skepticism,\" that\nis, skepticism concerning our knowledge of what states of affairs are\npossible (see his “Ontological Arguments,” 1977/1995). He\napplies it in a reply to the argument from evil (1991/1995, 1996,\n2006). This is a vigorous application of items 3 and 4 from Alston's\ninventory. The idea here is that there is no reason to think that our\nmodal intuitions about matters not related to ordinary life are\nreliable. It is plausible that the moral skepticism involved is just a\nsub-class of the modal skepticism involved, and even if it is not a\nsubclass, all the issues are quite parallel. Thus for the sake of\nbrevity the focus will be primarily on the “pure” modal\nskepticism here, though there will be a bit more to say about\npotential moral skepticism in Section 5. \n\nModal skepticism can be brought to bear on the argument from evil in\nthe following way. \n\nWhat can be said on behalf of Premise 1? One idea (adverted to by van\nInwagen frequently and by Howard-Snyder 2009, 27) is that our\ncognitive faculties evolved in a milieu which may underwrite their\nreliability in ordinary life but which does not extend outside that\ndomain. So trusting our intuition in extramundane matters would be\nlike trusting the reading of a barometer calibrated at sea level at\n14,200 feet on the West Buttress of Denali. It would be like trusting\nvision underwater. It would simply be unwise to do so, and, it seems,\nthe results, being beliefs, inferences, judgments, what have you, of\ntrusting one's intuitions in those circumstances would have little by\nway of justification.  \n\nVan Inwagen himself applies the modal skepticism a bit differently. It\ncould be that he accepts a theory of knowledge relevantly similar to\nthat of David Lewis on which one must rule out all relevant, or in van\nInwagen's case “real,” possibilities, but there is another\nway to take it. He tells a story according to which the world has the\namount and distribution of evils we think it has and God exists which,\nhe says, is a “real, possibility,” that is, something that\nmight be true for all we know. The idea of a real possibility is best\nillustrated by what a TV lawyer would call an “alternative\ntheory of the crime” (van Inwagen, in discussion) which is\nplausible enough to cause doubt, in the sense of inability to assent,\nto the proposition that the accused is guilty. \n\nHis target is an argument like Draper's (1989/1996) neo-Humean\nargument from evil, which is an argument inspired by Hume, but\nsignificantly modernized. So the direct target is that the proposition\nS – which describes what suffering there likely is – is\nless probable on theism than on the “hypothesis of\nindifference.” The argument must go something like this, where\nthe modal intuitions in question concern whether certain proposed\npossibilities are genuine possibilities (with ‘T’\nfor theism). 1. Our modal intuitions not connected to ordinary life are\nunreliable. 2′. A judgment about the value of the probability of there\nbeing the suffering that there likely is, given theism, is justified\nonly if certain modal intuitions not related to ordinary life are\nreliable. 3′. Thus any judgment about the value of the probability of\nthere being the suffering that there likely is, given theism, is\nunjustified. \n\nAn example of the kind of proposed possibility in question will be\nhelpful.  Here is a state of affairs that some claim to intuit to be\npossible which is relevant to an important version of the argument\nfrom evil: God's seeing to it both that every animal who is not\nobserved does not suffer and that natural laws are not massively\nirregular.  This is the kind of proposed possibility a proponent\nof the argument from evil might advance to show that the present state\nof affairs is unjustified.  Van Inwagen's modal skeptic will not\naccept that this is a genuine possibility, since it is too removed\nfrom ordinary life. Obviously, since relatedness to ordinary life\ncomes in degrees, there will be issues from vagueness affecting the\napplication of this strategy.  So it will often not be clear whether a\nproposition is to be doubted by the modal realist on the basis of\ndistance from ordinary life.  In fact, we may use the above proposed\npossibility concerning animal suffering and regularity as an example\nof the problem of delineating “ordinary life.” For clearly\nour folk physics–that is, our ordinary idea of how the physical\nworld works–includes that the world is very regular and animal\nsuffering and predation are a part of most people's lives, at least\nthose who have ever owned a pet or visited a farm or are regular meat\neaters.  \nA first obvious question for the advocate of this argument is whether\nPremise 1 itself is a matter of “ordinary life.” That is,\nis the matter of when intuitions are justified a matter of ordinary\nlife?  It is not at all clear that they are.  And if they are not,\nthen the argument might have a self-referential problem: If the first\npremise is true, then the first premise is unjustified. Another kind\nof self-referential problem for van Inwagen himself is that he\nadvances a defense featuring a proposition just as far from ordinary\nlife as the example above. Specifically, the proposition above\n– God's seeing to it both that every animal who is not\nobserved does not suffer and that natural laws are not massively\nirregular – which van Inwagen would reject as genuinely\npossible seems no farther from ordinary life than the possibilities\nvan Inwagen himself proposes as genuine (see van Inwagen 2006,\n114). Also, there are other problems concerning delineating the bounds of\ndelineating the bounds of “ordinary life.” There is both a\nsynchronic (at-a-moment) and diachronic (across time) problem\nhere. The synchronic problem is delineating the bounds of ordinary\nlife at any one time or short segment of time. \n\nThe diachronic problem here is that what counts as “everyday\nlife” changes over time. It has been a long time since the\nemergence of Homo sapiens and our lives have changed\nsignificantly since then. So arguments of the form “This wasn't\npart of everyday life 115,000 years ago so we can't trust it”\nare dubious. Our eyes did not evolve in a milieu to which driving a\ncar was relevant to survival, but we do pretty well at it,\nnevertheless. \n\nSecond, even when we know something isn't functioning in the\nenvironment for which it was designed (by God or evolution or both,\nbut more of that next), we can still trust judgments based on them, if\nwe know a little something about the manner in which they are likely\nto be mistaken. So let's return to 14,200 feet on the West Buttress of\nDenali with our barometer last calibrated at sea level. Since we know\nsomething about the relationship between altitude and barometric\npressure, we can extrapolate or estimate the true value from the\nreported value to derive a range in which the true value is likely to\nbe (if we have precise data we can generate confidence intervals which\nunder good circumstances would be quite narrow). And we can certainly\ntrust certain comparative judgments: even if we are almost completely\nignorant of how to correct for the altitude change, if the reading\nfalls fast consistently for an hour, we can safely infer that a low\npressure front is moving in.  So even a poorly calibrated instrument\ncan be of use if we have appropriate understanding of its inner\nworkings. \n\nTherefore, even if we have reason to believe our modal intuitions will\nbe off in certain domains, we might either have a reasonable theory\nabout how they are likely to be off and thus have the ability to\ncorrect them, or at least be able to make certain comparative\njudgments. For example, if it seems blindingly obvious that the\nfundamental constants of the universe could have had different values\nthan they do or that there could have been other fundamental\nparticles, forces, fields, or what have you, we might think, after\nreflecting upon how far removed from ordinary life the proposed\npossibility is, our intuition is giving too strong a reading and dial\nit back to the more moderate conclusion that it is very likely that\nthese are genuine possibilities. It would be far too skeptical merely\nto discard the intuition.  \n\nSimilarly, if it seems blindingly obvious to us that there is no way\nthat all the creation-worthy (or best or what have you)\nworlds involve approximately the amount, or proportion, or severity of\nevil we think there is, then, realizing that this is far removed from\ndaily life we might dial it back to the more moderate conclusion that\non balance there are creation-worthy worlds with a significantly\nlesser amount, or severity, or proportion, or what have you, of\nevil. This is a far cry from van Inwagen's own conclusion that we have\n“no reason” (van Inwagen 1996/1991, 163) to accept the\nrelevant possibility claims. \n\nThird, evolutionary theory does not seem to be a good reason to doubt\nthat intuition will be unreliable outside of ordinary life.  For there\nare two ways for evolution to occur: with theism and without\ntheism. So let “extended intuition” name the thesis that\nour intuition is reliable in ways importantly extended beyond everyday\nlife, assuming the latter notion gets coherently worked out. While the\nprobability of extended intuition, given Evolution & ~Theism,\nmight be low, the probability of extended intuition, given Evolution\n& Theism, is plausibly quite high and surely not too low. So the\nquestion of the reliability of our intuition in domains beyond\neveryday life but relevant to our religiously proposed final end, and,\ntherefore perhaps an “everyday” matter anyway, is not\nindependent of whether one already thinks there is a God. \n\nFourth, it has been alleged that the modal skepticism used by the\nskeptical theist leads to widespread skepticism about ordinary\nmatters, perhaps even total skepticism (Russell 1996, Gale 1996,\nHasker 2010b). The objection seems to be based on the thesis that the\nskeptical theist's appeal to uneliminated possibilities can be\ncombined with any ordinary proposition to keep it from being known. To\nuse a more traditional version, Russell's (1996) example (see also\nearlier Russell and Wykstra 1988 and later Russell 2004), consider the\nproposition that the world was created about six thousand years ago at\nnightfall of the evening preceding Sunday, October 23rd (yes, that's\nthe actual attribution of Bishop Usher) with the appearance of much\ngreater age. Young-earth creationists give reasons for thinking that\nGod has reasons for this geologic deceptiveness. Since the theory\nincludes misleading appearances, it is consistent with all\nobservational data. Thus it can never be ruled out by empirical\nevidence. Accordingly, it seems not to be improbable on any of our\nevidence. This objection suggests that the skeptical theist's\nskepticism about that which is beyond ordinary life comes home to\nroost in skepticism about ordinary matters, such as the age of the\nEarth plausibly is (that is, plausibly the earth and the age of things\nare ordinary matters, even if not an ordinary topic of conversation).\nThis suggests that nearly any ordinary belief is called into question\nby skeptical theism.  \n\nFifth, the modal skeptic's thesis that our intuitions are not to be\ntrusted outside of ordinary life (or the milieu for which they\nevolved) seems to be at odds with the effectiveness of mathematics in\nparticle physics, cosmology, and the like. The mathematical beliefs of\nearly Homo sapiens were surely quite primitive (it is\nirrelevant for present purposes how much unconscious processing was\ndone by the brain). Interestingly, natural theology has been compared\nwith theoretical physics (Earman 2000). If this comparison holds up,\nit seems to tell against the present modal skeptical argument.  \n\nSixth, in reference to the significance of the existence of\n“real” possibilities some worries occur. The proper\nprocedures in a courtroom do not obviously apply to the philosophy\nroom. It might be prudent and socially utile to lock up, or otherwise\nseriously punish, those convicted of felonies only if a case can be\nmade that they are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. But when\nconsidering what it is rational to believe, one can clearly rationally\ndisbelieve p when it is not beyond a reasonable doubt that\n~p. An even safer claim is that one can still think it more\nlikely than not that ~p. Thus, even if van Inwagen is correct\nthat his defense against the argument from evil is successful on his\nterms – as successful as an alternative theory of the crime in\nacquitting the accused – one might still reasonably disbelieve\ntheism or at least believe it to be improbable. \n\nFurthermore, how strong does a contrary reason need to be to\nconstitute a reasonable doubt? Parallel question: how probable does a\nstory need to be to be a “real possibility”? To be a real\npossibility in an epistemic sense, a sense relevant to the\nreasonableness of the belief, would it have to be at least 5%\nprobable?  It wouldn't need to be 50% probable. Is it somewhere in the\nmiddle, say, 25–33%? And we mustn't confusedly bring in\nconsiderations of practical rationality here. We might say, speaking\nloosely, that there is a “real possibility” of a loaded\ngun going off accidentally even though this is extremely rare. But\nwhat about just aiming a standard six-shooter revolver down range with\none bullet spun into the magazine? We would bet against the first pull\nof the trigger resulting in a fired bullet. But would this be a real\npossibility, in van Inwagen's sense? It's hard to say, but here is an\nargument that it is. It seems wrong to believe that the gun\nwill not fire. That suggests that the threshold for reasonable belief\nis above 83%. So the thesis that there are real possibilities which\ninclude both God that exists and that there exists evil of the sort we\nfind may only entail that there is about 10–15% likelihood that\nthere is such a possibility. So a real possibility containing both God\nand evil such as we take to exist in this world might make it\nunreasonable to believe that there is no God, but it\ncertainly doesn't rule out agnosticism concerning whether God\nexists or a weak atheism to the effect that it is very probable that\nthere is no God.  \n\nWith respect to delineating the bounds of “ordinary life,”\nthe modal skeptic could perhaps rely on a physicalistic notion. That\nis, they could take the reference to focus upon activities\nappropriately related to reproduction, which entails survival through\nthe point of intercourse, which entails a certain life-span. This may\nexacerbate the fifth objection and ones like it, but see below for a\nreply to that problem. \n\nWith respect to the suggestion that we can still get useful\ninformation from extramundane intuition, the modal skeptic can press\none who advances this objection to work out in more detail how the\nextrapolation or adjustment works and then pick on the details.  \n\nWith respect to the charge of general skepticism little has been\nsaid. van Inwagen (1996) claims that his defensive stories are not\n– unlike general skeptical hypotheses – improbable\nrelative to what we know. Note that this is different from being\nimprobable relative to our empirical evidence, which skeptical\nhypotheses are not.  Certainly general skeptical hypotheses are not\n“real possibilities” in van Inwagen's sense, which he\ninsists on calling “epistemic possibilities,”; they are\nnot plausible alternatives that would cause ordinary folk to falter in\njudgment. More will be said about this as the problem recurs in\nSection 6. \n\nWith respect to the argument from the effectiveness of mathematics, it\ncould be replied that all the math involved in physics is somehow\n“contained” in basic “everyday” math or at\nleast that the computational abilities of individuals who perform\nadvanced math are contained in the computational abilities of early\nhomo sapiens. Obviously, these are contentious and in some cases\nempirical claims. So this line of reply would need to fill in lots of\ndetails to be very effective. \n\nWith respect to the point about real possibilities and probability,\nthe modal skeptic might say that ruling out being certain that God\ndoes not exist is something worth doing. It might make Pascalian\nconsiderations relevant, for example. \n\nThe last section treated an “extreme” (van Inwagen\n1996/1991, 163; 1995, 84; 2006, 123) modal and moral skepticism.  But\nthere are more focused modal and moral skepticisms, which purport to\nbe more moderate and targeted. That is, there are approaches that do\nnot attribute limits to modal and moral intuition as such. Rather,\nthey take some limitations on our modal knowledge that it seems all\nshould admit. Skeptical theists suggest that these limitations apply\nspecifically in the case of the argument from evil. \n\nIn its now-standard form (found primarily in Bergmann 2001, 279 and\n2008, 376), the core of skeptical theism consists in four skeptical\ntheses.  (ST1) We have no good reason for thinking that the possible goods\nwe know of are representative of the possible goods there are\n[representative, that is, relative to figuring (positively) in a\n(potentially) God-justifying reason for permitting the inscrutable\nevils we see around us]. (ST2) We have no good reason for thinking that the possible evils\nwe know of are representative of the possible evils there are. (ST3) We have no good reason for thinking that the entailment\nrelations we know of between possible goods and the permission of\npossible evils are representative of the entailment relations there\nare between possible goods and the permission of possible evils. (ST4) We have no good reason for thinking that the total moral\nvalue or disvalue we perceive in certain complex states of affairs\naccurately reflects the total moral value or disvalue they really\nhave. \n\nOne way of defending the thesis that there is pointless evil (see Rowe\n1979) is by reference to the fact that there are evils for which we\ncannot think of any good reason, even upon considerable reflection,\ni.e. inscrutable evils. Consider this example of the noseeum kind of\ninference we met in section 1.1.  \n\nThis is just a first approximation, of course, and an adequate version\nwould require much refinement. For example, one would need special\nconfidence in oneself to wield the inference as is. Yet replacing\n“I” with “No one” (and adjusting the grammar)\nwould be unjustified without further support as well, since it has far\ntoo broad a scope. But the point of the inference is clear enough. One\nversion of the Noseeum Inference goes like this. \n\nNote that (ST1)–(ST3) are all in the negative. That is, they\nstate that we lack a reason for thinking the sample\nis representative. Therefore, to be applicable to the\nnoseeum inference, the skeptical theist needs to add a lemma like\nthis. \n\nWith this lemma, it seems clear that if (ST1)–(ST3) are true,\nthen the Expanded Noseeum Inference is unsound.  \n\nYet this may be a weakness, for notice a crucial difference between\nthe first of Bergmann's skeptical theses and Howard-Snyder's agnostic\nthesis.  ST1: We have no good reason for thinking that the possible\ngoods we know of are representative of the possible goods there\nare. (Bergman 2001, 279, emphasis added). AT1: We should be in doubt about whether the goods we know\nof constitute a representative sample of all the goods there are.\n(Howard-Snyder 2009, 18, emphasis added). \n\nWhereas Bergmann focuses on lacking a positive reason for\nrepresentativeness, Howard-Snyder focuses on the presence of\ndoubt concerning representativeness. Here, Howard-Snyder's\napproach is more consonant with Wykstra's, since Wykstra's defense of\nObscurity would establish AT1 (whereas it provides only weak support\nfor ST1). An advantage of AT1 is that it, unlike ST1, does not require\nthe Representativeness Principle in order to be effective. For it is\nplausible that the lemma relies on something like the following\nprinciple. \n\nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust not only be (1) justified in believing E, but also (2)\njustified in believing that E makes probable P.\n(See the entry on\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification.) \n\nFumerton (Fumerton 1995, 36, 55ff.) makes a powerful case that once\nthis principle is accepted, it is very hard to avoid skepticism.\nThus, if Bergmann is committed to this principle, he seems to have\ntaken on a major commitment that Howard-Snyder has not.  \n\nOne reason for thinking (ST1)–(ST3) false is that in addition to\nconcerns about knowledge skepticism treated above, skeptical theism\nhas been accused of various kinds of moral skepticism (Russell 1996;\nAlmeida and Oppy 2003, 2004; Graham and Maitzen 2007, 2009). The main\nthreat comes from the open possibility – given (ST1)–(ST4)\n– that we can never know which action will have the best\noutcome. Indeed, we can't even sensibly assign probabilities to which\nacts will have the best outcome. So, to illustrate the point, suppose\nyou are witnessing an attempted killing that you could easily prevent\nby intervening. According to the approach under consideration, you\ncannot sensibly assign any probability to the proposition that the one\nbeing killed is a dangerous terrorist who is the target of an\nemergency assassination. So it seems that you can't possibly conclude\nthat preventing the killing is the best thing to do. And if not, then\nhow could you rightly do it? \n\nWith respect to the charge of moral skepticism, one can argue that\nsound moral judgment need only take into consideration what one knows\nover the practically available period of time. Then one need only be\naware of a prima facie duty to prevent what ones current\nevidence indicates to be bad states of affairs to have all one needs\nto act rightly, whether or not the action has the best outcome. In\nshort, right action is based on known goods and bads, not a\nset that contains unknown goods and bads. Being unknown, they simply\ncan't and so needn't be taken into consideration, bracketing issues of\nforeseeability. So in the assassinated terrorist case, there is one\nknown bad outcome immanent – the death – so there is one\nreason to intervene, and there is no known (or probable or\nforeseeable) bad, or if there are, such as slightly wounding the\nassailant, they are clearly outweighed, so the right thing to do is to\nintervene. So the consequentialist portion of one's moral theory can\nbe made adequately subjective to avoid the problem. (Bergmann and Rea\n2005 pursue a defense along these lines.)  An alternative reply is to\nadopt a proximate consequentialism that only assesses the direct\ncausal consequences of an act or otherwise more narrowly circumscribes\nthe delineation of consequences (see Sinott-Armstrong 2011 for an\naccount of direct causal consequentialism, see Collins, Hall, Paul\n2004 on denying the transitivity of causation).  \n\nOne concern with this response is that it is plausible that known\ngoods and bads are a sound basis for action only if one has reason to\nthink that the sample goods and bads are representative of all\nconnected goods and bads with respect to the property of justifying\nthe action, that is, that one has reason to think that knowing the\nwider story would not reverse one's judgment, or at least lack reason\nfor thinking the wider story would lead in another direction. It is\neven more plausible that known goods and bads are a sound basis for\naction only if it is not the case that agnosticism is not the\njustified attitude toward the proposition that the sample reasons are\nrepresentative of the total (objective) reasons, and, more plausible\nyet, if the individual has thought of this. Furthermore, some (Hasker\n2010b) think it is bad enough that skeptical theism admits that we can\nnever have good reason to believe an act is all-things-considered the\nbest, for we do sometimes have good reason to think that some action\nis on-the-whole best in the sense of having the best outcome. \nAlso, skeptical theists can claim to have another route to knowing an\nact is best, such as divine revelation, though it is not clear that\nthe problems don't recur, since one would need reason to think God\ndidn't have sufficient reason for deception in the purported\nrevelation.  \n\nSkeptical theism has historically been aimed only at the noseeum\ninference. But not all versions of the problem of evil rely on the\nnoseeum inference.  \n\nSkeptical theism appears to have nothing to say about a Humean\nargument from evil. A broadly Humean argument (Draper 1989/1996, 2008,\nand 2009) will invoke explanatory considerations such as explanatory\npower and simplicity. So consider this explanatory argument for\nnaturalism. \n\nThere is no noseeum inference in this argument. Do any of the\nskeptical theist strategies work against this argument? Bergmann\n(2009, 383ff) thinks so. For he thinks that premise 1 depends on\nassigning a value to the probability of this (kind of) distribution of\nsuffering, given theism. But that's just what he thinks we can't do,\ngiven his skeptical theses. \n\nSkeptical theism attempts to block Premise 1 of the above argument by\nblocking an assignment of probability to observed evil on\ntheism. However, consider this reformulation. Given: The universe\nseems indifferent to the suffering of sentient beings. 1′. It is known that the hypothesis of indifference predicts\nthe data of an apparently indifferent universe. 2. It is unknown whether the hypothesis of theism predicts the\ndata. 3. The hypotheses have approximately equal prior probabilities\n[that is, equal chance of being true before considering observational\nevidence]. 4. Therefore, the data confirm the hypothesis of indifference and\nnot the hypothesis of theism. \n\nHere is how the argument works.  Imagine a pair of scales in which we\nare weighing evidence concerning theism and atheism.  Once side of the\nscales is labeled “Theism” and the other side is labeled\n“Hypothesis of Indifference.” Premise 3 says the scales\nare at first even.  Premise 2 says that there is nothing to put on the\nsale marked “Theism.” Premise 1 says that there is\nsomething to put in the scale marked “Hypothesis of\nIndifference.” The conclusion says that after we have weighed\nthe evidence, the scales tip to the side labeled “Hypothesis of\nIndifference.” \n\nNot only does this argument not make a noseeum inference, it doesn't\nassign any probability at all to observed evils given theism. So this\nversion seems to be fundamentally immune to considerations pertaining\nto skeptical theism, except insofar as they can be brought to bear on\npremise 3.  \n\nA similar issue to the above stems from the Common Sense Problem of\nEvil. The problem is this (Cf. Dougherty 2008). A reasonable person\ncan have a network of background beliefs about what to expect from an\ninfinitely resourceful being such that the addition of facts about\nevil can cause them to have a basic (non-inferred) belief that God\ndoes not exist. Though the justification depends on support relations\nthat might be called “inferential” in the sense that were\nwe to consciously rehearse them in steps we would call it an\ninference, there are no inferences made, thus no noseeum\ninference. Thus, the fact that the world strikes them as\nnothing like what theism would predict – when, say, an evil\nstrikes them as unjustifiable – no standard form of skeptical\ntheism can apply, since all extant skeptical theisms are aimed at\nnoseeum inferences. The common sense problem of evil arises when\npeople see the world as unjustifiably bad (cf. Gellman\n1992). \n\nConsider the thesis of Reasons Commonsensism (RC). \n\nNow consider the following values for p: P1: That evil is unjustified. P2: That evil is unjustifiable P3: God would never allow that. P4: That is absolutely impermissible to allow. P5: The universe is indifferent to our suffering. P6: There is no God. \n\nThere are possible, and probably actual, individuals who jointly\nsatisfy the following criteria at a given time: C1: At least some value of p (listed above) satisfies RC\nfor S (and so S thereby has a reason to\nbelieve p). C2: S‘s background evidence contains nothing that\nsupports ~p more strongly than the reason they get for p\nfrom C1 holding. C3: S‘s background evidence contains nothing that\nsupports the thesis that the appearance that p is misleading\nstrongly enough to reduce the support S has for p in\nvirtue of C1 holding to the point that it is more reasonable for them\nto believe ~p rather than p.  C4: The relevant subset of S's cognitive faculties are\nfunctioning properly in the relevant respects. \n\nSuch individuals have immediate, non-inferential justification for\nbelieving that atheism is true. Thus, skeptical theism as standardly\ndevised – a mechanism of attack on a noseeum inference –\ndoes not apply. The Non-starter thesis – that evil does not even\nprovide a prima facie reason against theism that would need to be\ncountered by skeptical considerations – is false when applied to\nthe Common Sense Problem of Evil. Perhaps skeptical theists could\nadapt their strategy to offering a defeater for the reason one\nacquires when one satisfies C1–C4, but this does change the\ndebate significantly (see Matheson 2011, forthcoming and Dougherty 2011b,\nforthcoming).  \n\nBergmann (2012) offers an error theory to explain away the\noverwhelming impression of unjustifiability: that we can't grasp evils\nmuch worse than ones which give rise to this impression.  But this\nseems irrelevant, for the spectrum of truly horrendous evils is broad\nenough that the impression of unjustifiability can be generated from\nthe lower end of the spectrum, leaving instances at the higher end as\nproof that we can conceive of worse evils than those minimally\nsufficient for generating the common sense problem of evil. \n\nThis entry has thus far considered the present scope and limits of\nskeptical theism. Now, briefly, possible future extensions of\nskeptical theism will be considered.  \n\nBetween Bergmannian skeptical theism and van Inwagenian skeptical\ntheism, there are many degrees. One way in which skeptical theism can\nbe expanded is as follows. In the van Inwagen case, the way skepticism\nplays into the defense is this.  He says, “Here's a story\ncontaining both God and the pattern of evil we observe, and, because\nwe know so little, we don't know it's not true.” But this claim\nseems weak. Suppose that the probability threshold for knowledge is\napproximately .95. That puts these stories – the most that is\nsaid for which is that it is not the case that we know they are false\n– at between just greater than zero and perhaps 5%. There is\nroom for this strategy to be expanded to the broad category between\nthis and the truly credible, i.e. between 5% and whatever probability\nis sufficient for belief, which some say is greater than 50%\n(Swinburne, 2001) and others think as high as that for knowledge\n(Williamson 2000). For example, one might have a story one takes very\nseriously, one might even be somewhat tempted to believe it, which one\nadvocates as what we might call a “serious” possibility to\nimplicate its greater weight over “real”\npossibilities. van Inwagen is explicit that “real”\npossibilities do not have to be plausible (1996, 160–1). There\nmight be many such stories which due to some kind of cognitive\nlimitation, we can't support with great strength, not quite enough to\nbelieve, but which are very plausible (start at 50/50 and go in either\ndirection – stories that are 30% likely, say, or 60%\nlikely). These kinds of stories place significant limits on how much\nprobability evil drains from theism. These stories would be more like\nthe “just so” stories scientists tell to cover\nanomalies. They range from the merely not-known-not-to-be-false to the\nnot-quite-believable-but-quite-credible. Our ignorance often puts\npossibilities in the neighborhood of 50%, and such stories can have\nsignificant effects on the final probability of theism.  For\nif p entails ~q, and p is 50% likely, q\nhas serious problems stemming from our evidence for p, even\nthough we are far from knowing whether p is true or false. \n\nRowe's original argument (1979) focused on the death of a fawn in a\nforest fire. The case of animal suffering illustrates ways in which\nskeptical theism can be applied beyond the ways it has been thus\nfar. Until surprisingly recently, the suffering of non-human animals\nwas not a major factor in the problem of evil. But with the rise of\nconcern for animal welfare, that problem has emerged as a major part\nof the problem of evil.  \n\nMany skeptical theists attempt to rebut the argument from evil by\nurging skepticism about our ability to discern God's reasons for\naction. But the skeptical theist might seek to block the argument from\nevil by directing skepticism at other targets. For example, Michael\nMurray, who is explicitly skeptical of human cognitive ability to\naddress animal suffering (2008, 199), is skeptical of our ability to\nknow whether animals experience morally significant pain. He considers\narguments originating from Descartes and others that some kind of\nhigher-order thought is required for experience to be morally\nsignificant. He is explicit that he is not defending these views as\nprobable (2008, 58) but, rather, only as such that a person can have a\nreasonable perspective that does not entail their rejection (2008,\n72). This clearly has the marks of a skeptical theist strategy, but,\nquite unlike Wykstra's strategy, the skepticism at play is not\nmotivated by God's greatness or, as in the cases of van Inwagen and\nBergmann, a kind of general moral-modal skepticism, but, rather, a\nvery different kind of human cognitive limitation: our inability to\npenetrate the mind of the animal.  \n\nAnother natural extension of skeptical theist reasoning that is\nillustrated in the case of animals is skepticism about whether we know\ntheir post-mortem fate. So suppose one is a reasonable agnostic,\nsuspending judgment about whether or not there is a God, but having\nsomewhat better reason to doubt than to believe that there is a\nGod. If the skeptical theist can make a good argument that it is\nhighly likely (given theism) that animals' suffering will be defeated\nin an afterlife – where, following Marilyn McCord Adams (2000),\nan evil, like suffering, “is defeated within the context of the\nindividual's life if the individual's life is a good whole to which\n[the evil] bears the relevant organic unity...by being relevantly\nintegrated into [the individual's] relation to a great enough\ngood” (28,29) – then the agnostic's own skepticism about\nwhether there is a God or not commits them to skepticism about whether\nor not animals' suffering is defeated in the afterlife. And without\nknowing whether or not animals' suffering is defeated in the\nafterlife, the case against God from animal suffering is severely\nblunted."}]
