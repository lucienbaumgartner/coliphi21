Look","author1.info":"http://www.uky.edu/~look","entry":"leibniz","body.text":"\n\n\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was one of the great\nthinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and is known as\nthe last “universal genius”. He made deep and important\ncontributions to the fields of metaphysics, epistemology, logic,\nphilosophy of religion, as well as mathematics, physics, geology,\njurisprudence, and history. Even the eighteenth-century French atheist\nand materialist Denis Diderot, whose views were very often at odds\nwith those of Leibniz, could not help being awed by his achievement,\nwriting in his entry on Leibniz in the Encyclopedia,\n“Perhaps never has a man read as much, studied as much,\nmeditated more, and written more than Leibniz… What he has\ncomposed on the world, God, nature, and the soul is of the most\nsublime eloquence. If his ideas had been expressed with the flair of\nPlato, the philosopher of Leipzig would cede nothing to the\nphilosopher of Athens” (Oeuvres complètes,\nvol. 7, p. 709). Indeed, Diderot was almost moved to despair in this\npiece: “When one compares the talents one has with those of a\nLeibniz, one is tempted to throw away one's books and go die quietly\nin the dark of some forgotten corner” (Oeuvres\ncomplètes, vol. 7, p. 678). More than a century later,\nGottlob Frege, who fortunately did not cast his books away in despair,\nexpressed similar admiration, declaring that “in his writings,\nLeibniz threw out such a profusion of seeds of ideas that in this\nrespect he is virtually in a class of his own” (“Boole's\nlogical Calculus and the Concept-script” in\nPosthumous Writings, p. 9). The aim of this entry is primarily\nto introduce Leibniz's life and summarize and explicate his views\nin the realms of metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophical theology.\n\n\n\nNote that throughout this entry, the following standard abbreviations\nare used: PC (Principle of Contradiction), PSR (Principle of\nSufficient Reason), PII (Principle of the Identity of\nIndiscernibles), PIN (Predicate-in-Notion Principle), and CIC\n(Complete Individual Concept).\n\n\n\nLeibniz was born in Leipzig on July 1, 1646, two years prior to the\nend of the Thirty Years War, which had ravaged central Europe. His\nfamily was Lutheran and belonged to the educated elite on both sides:\nhis father, Friedrich Leibniz, was a jurist and professor of Moral\nPhilosophy at the University of Leipzig, and his mother, Catharina\nSchmuck, the daughter of a professor of Law. Leibniz's father\ndied in 1652, and his subsequent education was directed by his mother,\nuncle, and according to his own reports, himself. He was given access\nto his father's extensive library at a young age and proceeded to\npore over its contents, particularly the volumes of ancient history and\nthe Church Fathers. \n\nIn 1661 Leibniz began his formal university education at the\nUniversity of Leipzig. As the “modern” philosophy of\nDescartes, Galileo, Gassendi, Hobbes and others had not made a great\nimpact by this time in the German-speaking lands, Leibniz's\nphilosophical education was chiefly Scholastic in its nature, though\nhe was also exposed to elements of Renaissance humanism.  While in\nLeipzig, Leibniz met Jacob Thomasius, who would have an important\ninfluence on Leibniz and who supervised Leibniz's first philosophical\ntreatise On the Principle of Individuation (De principio\nindividui). It was Thomasius more than anyone else perhaps who\ninstilled in Leibniz a great respect for ancient and medieval\nphilosophy. Indeed, one of the leitmotifs of Leibniz's philosophical\ncareer is his desire to reconcile the modern philosophy with the\nphilosophy of Aristotle, Plato, the Scholastics and the Renaissance\nhumanist tradition. After receiving his baccalaureate from Leipzig, he\ncontinued his studies at the University of Altdorf. While there\nLeibniz published in 1666 the remarkably original Dissertation on\nthe Art of Combinations (Dissertatio de arte\ncombinatoria), a work that sketched a plan for a “universal\ncharacteristic” and logical calculus, a subject that would\noccupy him for much of the rest of his life.  Although Leibniz was\noffered a position on the faculty of Law upon the completion of his\nDoctorate of Law in 1667, he had a different future in mind. \n\nIn that year, Leibniz met Baron Johann Christian von Boineburg,\na Protestant convert to Catholicism, who was able to secure a position\nfor Leibniz with the Elector of Mainz. While in the court of the\nElector, Leibniz composed a series of works in philosophical theology,\nthe Catholic Demonstrations, which are another manifestation\nof Leibniz's lifelong irenicism: in this case, in their attempt\nto provide a basis and justification for the reconciliation of\nProtestantism and Catholicism. Leibniz also turned his mind to natural\nphilosophy, having finally been able to study some of the works of the\nmoderns; the result was a two-part treatise in 1671, the New\nPhysical Hypothesis (Hypothesis physica nova). The first\npart, the Theory of Abstract Motion (Theoria motus\nabstracti), was dedicated to the Académie des Sciences de\nParis, and the second part, the Theory of Concrete Motion\n(Theoria motus concreti), was dedicated to the Royal Society\nin London. These works, however, were not likely to impress their\naudiences, for, given his circumstances, Leibniz could not but produce\namateurish works in the field. \n\nThis changed, however, in 1672, when Leibniz was given the single\nmost important opportunity of his life: the Elector of Mainz sent him\non a diplomatic mission to Paris, the center of learning and science at\nthe time. Leibniz was able to stay in Paris for four years (with a\nbrief trip to London in 1673), during which time he met many of the\n major figures of the intellectual world, among them \n Antoine Arnauld,\n Nicholas Malebranche, \n and,\n most important, the Dutch mathematician and physicist, \n Christiaan Huygens. \n It was he, “the great Huygenius” (as John Locke would\ncall him in the Dedicatory Epistle to his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding), who took Leibniz under his wing and tutored him\nin the developments in philosophy, physics, and mathematics. Not only\nwas Leibniz able to converse with some of the greatest minds of the\nseventeenth century while in Paris, he was also given access to the\nunpublished manuscripts of Descartes and Pascal. And, according to\nLeibniz, it was while reading the mathematical manuscripts of Pascal\nthat he began to conceive what would eventually become his\ndifferential calculus and his work on infinite series. In this time,\nLeibniz also designed a calculating machine able to perform addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division (see the Other Internet\nResources for a picture).  And his trip to London in 1673 was meant in\npart to present his designs to the Royal Society. \n\nWhile Leibniz was living the life of the mind in Paris, his employer\ndied, and Leibniz was thus forced to look for another position. He\neventually found one as the librarian for Duke Johann Friedrich of\nBrunswick, who ruled in Hanover. On the way to Hanover, Leibniz stopped\nin Amsterdam to meet with Spinoza between November 18 and\n21, 1676, three months before the latter's death;\naccording to Leibniz's own notes, they spoke of Spinoza's\nyet-to-be-published Ethics, Cartesian physics, and\nLeibniz's improved version of the ontological argument (see\nbelow). Although Leibniz would travel to Italy for a time in the late\n1680s in order to conduct historical research for the House of Hanover\nand make many shorter trips (including to Vienna), the rest of his life\nwas essentially spent in Hanover and its environs, working in different\ncapacities for the court, first, for Johann Friedrich until his death\nin 1680, then for Johann Friedrich's brother, Ernst August (from\n1680 to 1698), and finally for the latter's son, Georg Ludwig,\nwho in 1714 would become George I of England. Leibniz's relations\nwith Ernst August and Georg Ludwig were not as amicable as his\nrelations with his original employer, but he was close to Sophie, the\nwife of Ernst August and youngest sister of Princess Elisabeth of\nBohemia, with whom Descartes had an important philosophical\ncorrespondence. (Sophie was also the daughter of Elizabeth Stuart, and\nit is for this reason that her son became King of England.) \n\nWhile Leibniz may have felt physically isolated from the\nintellectual scene of Europe, he did manage to stay connected through a\nvast network of correspondents. (Leibniz exchanged letters with over\n1100 different people in the course of his life.) Despite the great\ndemands placed on Leibniz as librarian, then historian, and Privy\nCouncillor at the court of Hanover, he was able to complete work that,\nin its breadth, depth, and sheer quantity, is staggering. \n\nLeibniz's final years were bleak. He was engaged in a\nvituperative debate with Newton and his followers over the priority of\nthe discovery of the calculus, even being accused of stealing\nNewton's ideas. (Most historians of mathematics now claim that\nNewton and Leibniz developed their ideas independently: Newton\ndeveloping the ideas first with Leibniz the first to publish.) And at\nthe court he was mocked for his wig and old-fashioned clothing (think\n1670s Paris!). When Georg became George, the acrimony surrounding\nLeibniz in England was so great that Leibniz was asked to remain in\nHanover rather than follow his employer to London. Leibniz died\nNovember 14, 1716. \n\nUnlike most of the great philosophers of the period, Leibniz did not\nwrite a magnum opus; there is no single work that can be said\nto contain the core of his thought. While he did produce two books, the\nTheodicy (1710) and the New Essays Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (finished in 1704 but not published until 1765), the\nstudent of Leibniz's thought must piece together Leibniz's\nphilosophy from his myriad writings: essays published in scholarly\njournals and in more popular journals; unpublished works left abandoned\nby their author; and his many letters. Moreover, many of\nLeibniz's writings have not yet been published. The authoritative\nscholarly version of Leibniz's works, the Akademie edition, has\nthus far only published his philosophical writings from 1663 to 1690;\nin other words, only half of his writing life has been\ncovered. And the mere act of dating pieces often depends upon careful\nanalysis of the paper Leibniz wrote on and watermarks and so on.\n(Hence, for example, the important short work, Primary Truths,\nwhich, because of its content, was often thought to date to 1686 (as in\nAG), has recently been redated by the Akademie editors to 1689 because\nof a watermark.) Piecing together Leibniz's philosophy into a\nsystematic whole is made more difficult because Leibniz seems to have\nchanged or at least refined his views on a number of issues over the\ncourse of his career and because he was always very aware (some might\nsay too aware) of the audience for any of his writings. \n\nAs stated above, Leibniz's intellectual training was squarely\nin the tradition of Scholasticism and Renaissance humanism; his\nbackground, then, was of Aristotelianism, Platonism, and orthodox\nChristianity. Yet, as he became more familiar with the modern\nphilosophy of the seventeenth century, he came to see many of its\nvirtues. Although there is some reason to be skeptical of the details,\nthe spirit of the self-portrait Leibniz paints to Nicolas Remond in\n1714 can be a helpful guide for approaching his work. He writes: \n\nAgain, there is some reason to doubt whether Leibniz was really\nfifteen when he made his philosophical perambulations and whether and\nto what extent he had actually read any of the moderns. Nevertheless,\nthis self-portrait does express something that one sees in\nLeibniz's writings: the weaving together of varying strands of\nancient and modern philosophy in a remarkably creative and\nsophisticated manner. \n\nThe letter to Remond makes clear that Leibniz had reservations about\ncertain aspects of the modern philosophy, qualms that arose from and\nled him back to this eclectic mix of Aristotle and Christian Platonism.\nIt is probably most helpful, then, to see Leibniz's philosophy as\na reaction to two sets of modern opponents: on the one hand, Descartes\nand his followers; on the other hand, Hobbes and Spinoza. \n\nLeibniz's critique of Descartes and his followers was focused\nprincipally on the Cartesian account of body or corporeal substance.\nAccording to Descartes, the essence of body is extension; that is, a\ncorporeal substance is simply a geometric object made concrete, an\nobject that has size and shape and is in motion. This view, indeed, is\nthe cornerstone of the new mechanical philosophy to which Leibniz was\noriginally attracted. Nevertheless, Leibniz came to see two distinct\nproblems with this view. First, in claiming that the essence of body is\nextension, Descartes is endorsing the view that matter is infinitely\ndivisible. But if matter is infinitely divisible, then one can never\narrive at the simple unities that must exist at some ontological ground\nlevel. Second, if matter is simply extension, then there is in its\nnature no source of activity. If this is so, Leibniz thought, then the\nbodily objects of the world cannot count as substances. \n\nHobbes and Spinoza, despite their own differences, advanced, or were\nread as advancing, a number of objectionable and deeply troubling\ntheses which Leibniz (and most of his contemporaries) saw as an\nenormous threat: materialism, atheism, and necessitarianism. It is\nLeibniz's response to Hobbesian and Spinozistic necessitarianism\nthat is perhaps of greatest interest, for he sought to develop an\naccount of action and contingency that would preserve divine and human\nfreedom. As will be shown, central to Leibniz's philosophy was\nthe view that God freely chose the best world from an infinite number\nof possible worlds and that a person could be said to act freely when\nthe contrary of that action does not imply a contradiction. (This topic\nwill be addressed principally in the article on Leibniz's Modal\nMetaphysics.) \n\nLeibniz asserts in the Monadology §§31–32,\n“Our reasonings are based on two great principles, that of\ncontradiction… [and] that of sufficient\nreason” (G II 612/AG 217). To these two great principles\ncould be added four more: the Principle of the Best, the\nPredicate-in-Notion Principle, the Principle of the Identity\nof Indiscernibles, and the Principle of Continuity. The\nrelation among these principles is more complicated than one might\nexpect. Leibniz sometimes suggests that the Principle of the Best and\nthe Predicate-in-Notion Principle can be said to ground his “two\ngreat principles”; at other times, however, all four principles\nseem to work together in a system of circular implication. And while\nthe Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles is often presented in\ncontemporary discussions in analytic metaphysics as a stand-alone axiom,\nLeibniz tells us that it follows from the two great principles.\nFinally, the Principle or Law of Continuity is actually a principle\nthat Leibniz takes from his work in mathematics and applies to the\ninfinite hierarchy of monads in the world and to the quality of their\nperceptions; it appears to derive only tenuous support from the\nPrinciple of Sufficient Reason. \n\nLeibniz presented a number of arguments for the existence of God,\nwhich represent great contributions to philosophical theology and\nwhich will be discussed below. But one of the most basic principles of\nhis system is that God always acts for the best. While this is\ngenerally treated as an axiom, the opening of the Discourse on\nMetaphysics does present something of an argument for it:\n“God is an absolutely perfect being”; “power and\nknowledge are perfections, and, insofar as they belong to God, they do\nnot have limits”; “Whence it follows that God, possessing\nsupreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only\nmetaphysically, but also morally speaking…” (AG 35) This\nmight not appear a surprising claim from a theist, but it is not\nobvious that God must always act for the best or even create the best\nworld. (See Adams 1972) And Leibniz sometimes implicitly, sometimes\nexplicitly, appeals to this principle in his metaphysics, most notably\nwhen he is also employing the Principle of Sufficient Reason.  Indeed,\nwhen it comes to the creation of the world, the “sufficient\nreason” for God's choice of this world is that this world is the\n“best” of all possible worlds; in other words, in this\ncase the Principle of Sufficient Reason is essentially the Principle\nof the Best.  \n\nLeibniz has a very distinctive notion of truth, one which underlies\nmuch of his metaphysics. But this notion of truth goes back to\nAristotle's Organon (cf. Posterior Analytics I.4),\nas Leibniz himself says, and it is also present in Arnauld and\nNicole's Logic, or the Art of Thinking (Book IV, Chapter 6).\nAs Leibniz puts it in a letter to Arnauld, “in every true\naffirmative proposition, whether necessary or contingent, universal or\nparticular, the notion of the predicate is in some way included in\nthat of the subject. Praedicatum inest subjecto; otherwise I\ndo not know what truth is” (G II 56/L 337). As he tells us in\nthe Primary Truths and the Discourse on Metaphysics,\nmany things follow from the Predicate-in-Notion Principle (PIN),\nincluding what he believes to be the correct analysis of necessity and\ncontingency. \n\nLeibniz also follows Aristotle (cf. Metaphysics IV.3), in\nplacing great emphasis on the Principle of Identity or the Principle of\nContradiction (PC). PC states simply that “a proposition cannot\nbe true and false at the same time, and that therefore \nA is A and cannot be not A” \n(G VI 355/AG 321). According to Leibniz, the\nprimary truths of his metaphysical system are identities, but, in a\nstriking move, he combines PC with PIN and asserts in Primary\nTruths that “all remaining truths are reduced to primary\ntruths with the help of definitions, that is, through the resolution of\nnotions” (A VI iv 1644/AG 31). Furthermore, the combination of PC\nand PIN will mean that, since in any true proposition the predicate is\ncontained explicitly or implicitly within the subject, this is so for\nall affirmative truths, whether they be universal or\nparticular, necessary or contingent. Leibniz will use this seemingly\ninnocuous principle to draw profoundly strong metaphysical conclusions\nabout the nature of substance and modality. \n\nThe Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) in its classic form is\nsimply that nothing is without a reason (nihil est sine\nratione) or there is no effect without a cause. As\nLeibniz remarks, this principle “must be considered one of the\ngreatest and most fruitful of all human knowledge, for upon it is built\na great part of metaphysics, physics, and moral science” (G VII\n301/L 227). In the Principles of Nature and Grace, Leibniz\nsuggests that the claim that nothing takes place without a sufficient\nreason means that nothing happens in such a way that it is impossible\nfor someone with enough information to give a reason why it is so and\nnot otherwise. In the Monadology and elsewhere, however,\nLeibniz frankly admits that “most of the time these reasons\ncannot be known to us” (G VI 612/AG 217). While the idea that\nevery event must have a cause and that there is a reason why everything\nis so and not otherwise again might not seem novel, it is the\nconnection that Leibniz sees between this principle and his other\nmetaphysical principles that is noteworthy. According to Leibniz, PSR\nmust actually follow from PIN, for if there were a truth that had no\nreason, then there would be a proposition whose subject did not contain\nthe predicate, which is a violation of Leibniz's conception of\ntruth. \n\nPC and PSR may seem innocent enough, but Leibniz's other\nwell-known principle, the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles\n(PII), is more controversial. (See also the entry on \nidentity of indiscernibles.) \nIn one of Leibniz's typical\nformulations, PII states that “it is not true that two substances\ncan resemble each other completely and differ only in number [solo\nnumero]” (A VI, iv, 1541/AG 42). In other words, if two things\nshare all properties, they are identical, or  \n(∀F)(Fx ↔\nFy) → x = y. \nWhat is particularly important to note,\nhowever, is that Leibniz is adamant that certain kinds of properties\nare excluded from the list of properties that could count as\ndifference-making properties, chief among these spatio-temporal\nproperties. This is what Leibniz means (in part) when he asserts that there\ncan be no purely extrinsic (i.e., relational) determinations.\nTherefore, it is not the case that there could be two chunks of matter\nthat are qualitatively identical but existing in different locations.\nIn Leibniz's view, any such extrinsic difference must be founded\non an intrinsic difference. As he puts it in the \nNew Essays, \n\nThere is also the related, though uncontroversial, Principle of the Indiscernibility of\nIdenticals: if two things are identical, then they share all\nproperties, or  x = y →\n(∀F)(Fx\n↔ Fy).  The combination of these two principles\nis sometimes called “Leibniz's Law”: two things are\nidentical if and only if they share all properties, or\nx = y ↔ \n(∀F)(Fx\n↔ Fy). (Sometimes, unfortunately, only the Principle of\nthe Indiscernibility of Identicals is so called.) \n\nIt is also interesting to note that in his Primary Truths\nand Correspondence with Clarke, Leibniz presents PII not as a bedrock\naxiom of his system but as a consequence of PC and PSR.\nBriefly, one way to sketch the argument is this: \n\nNow, it was said above that Leibniz excludes purely extrinsic\ndenominations (or relational properties) from the kinds of properties\nthat are constitutive of an individual. To allow purely extrinsic\ndenominations would be to accept the possibility that that two things\ncould be discernible in terms of their relational properties while\nbeing identical in terms of their intrinsic properties, for their\nrelational properties would not follow from their intrinsic properties.\n(Again, if relational properties were allowed to factor into the nature\nof an individual, then PII would be relatively weak. Of course two\nthings that exist in different spatio-temporal locations are distinct,\nand that is what Leibniz admits in the passage from the New\nEssays above.) But if we follow Leibniz in excluding such\nrelational properties as difference-making properties and reflect on\nthe above argument, then we see that worlds are distinguished in terms\nof intrinsic properties of individuals and that this difference has a\nbearing on the relative greatness or perfection of a world. Again, let\na and b be\nindiscernible but occupying mirror positions in\nW and W*. How could\nwe ever say that W was more worthy of\nGod's choice than W*? We could not.\nThere must be a reason why a is here\nand b is there, and this reason has\nto do with the intrinsic properties of a and\nb. In other words, even the relational\nproperties must be somehow derivative of the intrinsic properties of\nsubstances. \n\nAs we shall see, Leibniz employs this principle in a range of\narguments: against the mind as a tabula rasa, against atomism,\nagainst Newtonian absolute space, and so on. (For more on this subject,\n consult the entry on \n identity of indiscernibles.) \n\nAccording to Leibniz, there are “two famous labyrinths where\nour reason very often goes astray” (G VI 29/H 53). The first\nconcerns human freedom, the latter the composition of the continuum.\nLeibniz, however, thought that he had found the way out of each\nlabyrinth, and his solution to the problem of the continuum is related\nultimately to a maxim or law that he\nemploys not only in his mathematical writings but also in his\nmetaphysics. As he puts it in the Preface to the New Essays,\n“Nothing takes place suddenly, and it is one of my great and best\nconfirmed maxims that nature never makes leaps” (A VI\nvi 56/RB 56). More exactly, Leibniz believes that this law or principle\nimplies that any change passes through some intermediate change and\nthat there is an actual infinity in things. The Principle of Continuity\nwill be employed to show that no motion can arise from a state of\ncomplete rest and that “noticeable perceptions arise by degrees\nfrom ones which are too minute to be noticed” (ibid.). \n\nFor Leibniz, the fundamental questions of metaphysics were reducible\nto questions of ontology: What is there? What are the most basic\ncomponents of reality? What grounds what? In a certain sense, his answer remained constant\nthroughout his life: everything is composed of or reducible to\nsimple substances; everything is grounded in simple\nsubstances. While Leibniz appears to have given slightly different\naccounts of the precise nature of these simple substances over the\ncourse of his career, there are many features that remained constant\nin his mature philosophy: Leibniz always believed that a substance had\na “complete individual concept” and that it was\nessentially an active unity endowed with perception and appetition. \n\nIn §8 of the Discourse on Metaphysics, Leibniz gives\none of his most important accounts of the nature of individual\nsubstance. There he claims that the Aristotelian idea that a substance\nis that which is the subject of predication and which cannot be\npredicated of something else is insufficient for a true analysis of the\nnature of substance. He next appeals to the PC and the PIN: in every\ntrue predication, the concept of the predicate is contained in the\nconcept of the subject. “Since this is so,” Leibniz claims,\n“we can say that the nature of an individual substance or of a\ncomplete being is to have a notion so complete that it is sufficient to\ncontain and to allow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the\nsubject to which this notion is attributed” (A VI iv 1540/AG 41).\nIn other words, x is a substance if and only\nif x has a complete individual\nconcept (CIC), that is, a concept that contains within it\nall predicates of x past,\npresent, and future. The CIC, then, serves to individuate substances;\nit is able to pick out its bearer from an infinity of other finite\ncreated substances. Leibniz gives as an example Alexander the Great. The\nconcept of Alexander contains being a King, being a student of\nAristotle, conquering Darius and Porus, and so on. Now, “God,\nseeing Alexander's individual notion or haecceity, sees in it at the\nsame time the basis and reason for all the predicates which can be said\ntruly of him” (A VI iv 1540–41/AG 41). Leibniz's invocation\nof the Scotist notion of a haecceity is intriguing. What\nLeibniz is telling us is that Alexander's thisness is\ndetermined by the sum of his qualitative properties. Moreover, we can\nsee a metaphysical aspect to this logical conception of substance: the\ncomplete individual concept of a substance is the notion or\nessence of the substance as it known by the divine\nunderstanding. \n\nLeibniz concludes this section with his celebrated doctrine\nof marks and traces: “when we consider\ncarefully the connection of things, we can say that from all time in\nAlexander's soul there are vestiges of everything that has\nhappened to him and marks of everything that will happen to him and\neven traces of everything that happens in the universe, even though God\nalone could recognize them all” (A VI iv 1541/AG 41). The\ndoctrine of marks and traces, therefore, claims that, because the CIC\ncontains all predicates true of a substance past, present, and future,\nthe entire history of the universe can be read (if only by God) in the\nessence of any individual substance. \n\nThe consequences that Leibniz draws from the logical conception of\nsubstance and the doctrine of marks and traces are remarkable. In the\nfollowing section (§9) of the Discourse on Metaphysics,\nwe are told they include the following: \n\nUnfortunately, Leibniz's reasons for drawing these\nconsequences are not in all cases obvious. Why should PII follow from\nthe complete individual concept account of substance? If we consider\nthe CIC as that which allows us to pick out and individuate any\nindividual substance from an infinity of substances, then we realize\nthat, if the individual concepts of two substances,\na and b, do not\nallow us (or God) to distinguish the one from the other, then their\nindividual concepts are not complete. That is, there must\nalways be a reason, found within the complete individual concept of\nsubstances and issuing from the free decree of God, that\na is discernible from\nb. And this fact points to another important\nfact about the interpretation suggested above: it is not only the case\nthat each substance has a complete individual concept–the\nessence of the substance as it exists in the divine mind–but\nfor every essence or complete individual concept there is one and only\none substance in a world. (The argument here is essentially that which\nwas given above in the section describing the relation between PSR and\nPII; namely, what reason could God have had for instantiating two\nsubstances with identical CICs?) Further, why should it be the case\nthat substances can only arise naturally in God's creation of the\nworld and end in his annihilation? If one takes quite literally\nLeibniz's claim that the CIC contains within it all predicates\ntrue of the substance past, present, and future, then one might be able\nto say that this must include truths extending back to the creation and\nforward either infinitely or to the end of time. This argument might be\nsomewhat weak in itself, but it certainly would seem to follow from\nLeibniz's logical notion of substance and one of the\nother consequences, namely, that each substance is a mirror of the\nentire universe. If this is the case, then a substance,\ninsofar as it is a mirror of the entire universe, must have within its\ncomplete individual concept predicates that extend back to creation and\nforward in time. At first glance, it is also not readily apparent\nmerely from the CIC and doctrine of marks and traces why a substance\ncannot be constructed from two substances or be divided into two new\nsubstances. Let substance x have within its\ncomplete individual concept predicates g, h, i… which\nare true of it past, present and future. Suppose\nx were to be divided into\nxα and\nxβ. One might imagine that\nboth new substances would have all of\nx's pre-division predicates in common\nand unique predicates thereafter. But the relevant part of\nLeibniz's logical notion of substance is that the CIC is\nsufficiently rich to allow us (or God) to deduce from it all predicates\npast, present and future. Leibniz's implicit suggestion is that\nthe pre-division predicates would not allow the logical deduction of\nbranching or divided substances. If g, h, i,… imply\nlα, mα, nα,\nthey cannot also imply lβ, mβ,\nnβ. A similar argument works against the\npossibility of the fusion of two substances. Further, if we already\ngrant PII, then it should be clear that the substance having within its\nCIC predicates g, h, i, … lα,\nmα, nα, and the substance having\nwithin its CIC predicates g, h, i, … lβ,\nmβ, nβ are numerically distinct\nsubstances and not simply one substance in its pre-division phase that\nhas multiplied. Since substances can only naturally arise during\nGod's creation of the world and since substances cannot undergo\nfusion or fission, it is obvious that the number of substances must\nremain constant. Finally, if it is the case that it is of the nature of\na substance to have a notion so complete that one can deduce from it\nall its predicates past, present, and future and if substances exist\nfrom the creation of the world, then it would seem (relatively) natural\nto conclude that each substance contains within it a kind of story of\nthe entire universe from its own particular perspective. While more\nwill be said below, what Leibniz is suggesting here is a set of\ndoctrines that he will develop in greater detail: the\nworlds apart doctrine, the\nmirroring (or expression) thesis, and the\ndoctrine of universal harmony. \nAnother notable consequence of the logical conception of substance is\nthe denial of the causal interaction of finite\nsubstances. This is clearest in Primary Truths (C 521/L\n269/AG 33), where a very similar argument concerning the nature of\nsubstance is given. Not only is it the case, Leibniz claims, that\ngenuine physical influx – the transfer of some property within\none substance to a second substance – is inexplicable, but more\nimportant the logical conception of substance shows us that\nthe reasons for any property that a substance may have are\nalready contained within its CIC. In other words, every state of a\nsubstance is explained, grounded, or caused by its own notion or\nCIC. (Of course, the ground or reason for the existence or actuality\nof any particular substance is to be found in God and his free choice\nof worlds. A more detailed account of Leibniz's views on causation is\navailable in the entry\n Leibniz on Causation.) \nAs we shall see below, the denial of the causal interaction of\nsubstances forms an essential premise of Leibniz's argument for\npre-established harmony. \n\nIf a finite substance is to have a CIC, as Leibniz claims in §8\nof the Discourse on Metaphysics, what is its ontological\nstatus? That is, what kind of thing could have such a CIC or such a\nnature? Leibniz's answer to this question brings to the fore\nanother paradigm of substancehood: unity. While it is the nature of an\nindividual substance to have a CIC, only a genuine unity can\nqualify as a substance. Leibniz expresses his position in a letter to\nArnauld in a very clear and forceful manner: “To put it briefly,\nI hold this identical proposition, differentiated only by the emphasis,\nto be an axiom, namely, that what is not truly\none being is not truly one\nbeing either.” (G II 97/AG 86)\nIn the period of the Discourse on Metaphysics and\nCorrespondence with Arnauld, Leibniz appeals to certain Scholastic\nnotions, chief among them, the notion of a substantial form. In later\nyears, the Scholastic way of speaking fades away, but the fundamental\nidea remains the same: there must be something that guarantees or makes\npossible the unity of a substance, and this is the substantial form or\nthe soul. The point Leibniz wants to make is that only a soul or a\nsubstantial form is the kind of thing that can be said to have or\nunderlie a complete individual concept, for only a soul or substantial\nform is by its nature an imperishable unity. Leibniz makes\nthis point very clear in another letter to Arnauld: “A\nsubstantial unity requires a thoroughly indivisible and naturally\nindestructible being, since its notion includes everything that will\nhappen to it, something which can be found neither in shape nor in\nmotion (both of which involve something imaginary, as I could\ndemonstrate), but which can be found in a soul or substantial form, on\nthe model of what is called me” (G II 76/AG 79). Thus,\nunity is the hallmark of a genuine substance, but equally important is\nLeibniz's paradigm case of a substance: the self. This\nthought underlies much of Leibniz's reflections on the nature of\nsubstance and has important consequences. For, following not only\nDescartes but also the entire Augustinian tradition, the\n“I” is essentially immaterial, a mind or a soul. Similarly,\nhe writes in Primary Truths, “Something lacking\nextension is required for the substance of bodies, otherwise there\nwould be no source [principium] for the reality of phenomena\nor for true unity… But since atoms are excluded, what remains is\nsomething lacking extension, analogous to the soul, which they once\ncalled form or species” (A VI iv 1648/AG 34). (Material atoms, as\nadvocated by Democritus in the classical period and by Gassendi and\nothers in the seventeenth century, are excluded, Leibniz thinks,\nbecause they violate PII; that is, two purely material atoms would seem\nto be qualitatively identical and yet distinct, which is impossible if\none accepts PC, PSR, and the derivation of PII.) \n\nLeibniz is not as clear as one would like him to be, for at this\npoint in his career it is possible to read him as seeing that something\nis a substance so long as it has a soul or a substantial form,\nwhereas later in his career it seems more clearly to be the case that\nthe only substances are souls or soul-like entities, the\nmonads. In other words, Leibniz can be interpreted as advocating, at\nleast in this period, a kind of Aristotelian hylomorphism, in which\nsubstances are composites of matter and form. This has been the subject\nof debate in the field, but this entry cannot adjudicate the\nmatter. (For more on this dispute, see Look 2010.) \n\nNevertheless, in declaring that a substance is necessarily\nindivisible, Leibniz renders it impossible for a body, or\nmatter alone, to be a substance. Thus, Cartesian corporeal\nsubstance, the essence of which is simply extension, cannot exist\nas substance. Put differently, Leibniz's argument is that nothing that\nis divisible is a substance; a Cartesian chunk of matter is divisible;\ntherefore, a Cartesian chunk of matter is not a substance.  This\npoints to the first part of Leibniz's critique of the Cartesianism\nmentioned above: namely, that according to Leibniz, Cartesian matter\nfails to have the unity required of a genuine substance. Indeed, in\nthe Correspondence with Arnauld, Leibniz considers the case of a human\nbody deprived of a soul and says the body, or cadaver, would not be a\nsubstance at all but merely an aggregate of substances. Moreover,\nanything lacking a substantial form or soul is not a substance, that\nis, if a thing is not truly “animated”, then it is only a\ntrue phenomenon. (G II 77/AG 80) It should be noted how strong\nLeibniz's claim is: he is arguing that Cartesian corporeal substances\nor any such chunks of matter are not real beings – at least not\nas real as simple substances.  Aggregates of simple substances,\ntherefore, have a different ontological status from simple\nsubstances. \n\nThe distinction between simple substances and aggregates becomes an\nimportant one in Leibniz's philosophy. To Arnauld, he writes the\nfollowing: “I hold that philosophy cannot be better reestablished\nand reduced to something precise, than by recognizing only substances\nor complete beings endowed with a true unity, together with the\ndifferent states that succeed one another; everything else is only\nphenomena, abstractions, or relations” (G II 101/AG 89). If this\nis the case, then aggregates of simple substances are merely phenomena\nand fail to have the reality of the underlying simples. Further, the\nbodies of natural philosophy, the bodies of the world we observe around\nus, would seem to be in some sense mere phenomena.  \n\nWhile some scholars of Leibniz's thought have suggested this, it does\nnot get at the full story of Leibniz's metaphysical system.  The\ndistinction that Leibniz draws is one between a real unity and a\nphenomenal unity, or as he also puts it, between a unum per\nse and a unum per aggregationem. Leibniz's favorite\ncomparison in the case of the latter is to a rainbow: bodies, for\nexample, fail to have intrinsic unity, but we do represent them as\nbeing single and unified objects much as we represent a rainbow as\nbeing one thing when it is in fact merely the result of the refraction\nof light through innumerable water droplets. But just as the rainbow\nresults from the presence of genuine unities, the water droplets (to\ncontinue the metaphor, even if this is not true when speaking with\nLeibniz in metaphysical rigor), so do the bodies of the natural world\nresult from the genuine simple substances.  Put differently, the\nsimple substances ground the phenomena of bodies in the\nworld. This relation between the phenomena and the underlying simple\nsubstances is what Leibniz means when he talks about\n“well-founded phenomena” [phenomena bene\nfundata].  But insofar as the bodies of the natural world are\nwell-founded phenomena – that is, insofar as they are grounded\nin the simple substances – they are not simply phenomena as in\nBerkeley's philosophy. (This view is also not uncontroversial.  To\ncompare Leibniz with Berkeley, see the entry on\n Berkeley.)   \n\nThe second part of Leibniz's critique of the Cartesian\ndoctrine of corporeal substance relates to the notion of activity.\nAccording to Leibniz, substances are not only essentially unities, but\nalso active. As he says in the opening line of the Principles of\nNature and Grace: “A Substance is a being capable\nof action” (G VI 598/AG 207). But Cartesian corporeal substance,\ninsofar as its essence is extension, cannot be itself a source of\nactivity. (G IV 510/AG 161) There are at least two strands to\nLeibniz's argument on this point. First, Leibniz holds that this\nis so because he adheres to the classical and Scholastic idea that\nactions pertain to supposita; that is, only something that can\nbe the subject of predication can be active, and only true unities can\nbe genuine subjects of predication (and not mere phenomena). Put\ndifferently, Cartesian extended stuff cannot, insofar as it is\ninfinitely divisible, constitute a suppositum, or subject of\npredication. But, second, Leibniz believes that something is active if\nand only if the source of its activity can arise within\nitself, that is, if and only if its activity arises spontaneously from\nwithin itself. This is another reason, then, that individual substances\nwill be understood as mind-like, for Leibniz believes that only minds\nor mind-like things can originate and alter their modifications. \n\nIn saying that substances are essentially active, Leibniz means that\nthey are endowed with forces. More precisely, according to\nLeibniz, “the very substance of things consists in a force for\nacting and being acted upon,” (G IV 508/AG 159) that is, each\nsimple substance is endowed with what Leibniz calls primitive active\nand passive powers. The idea here again sounds Aristotelian: a\nsubstance has a certain essentially active component, the soul or\nsubstantial form or first entelechy, and a passive component, primary\nmatter. In Leibniz's mature account, the primitive active force\nis “an inherent law, impressed by divine decree,” that is,\nit is the law of unfolding or the law of the series of the simple\nsubstance. As he puts it in a letter to De Volder, “I think that\nit is obvious that primitive forces can be nothing but the internal\nstrivings [tendentia] of simple substances, strivings by means\nof which they pass from perception to perception in accordance with a\ncertain law of their nature, and at the same time harmonize with one\nanother, representing the same phenomena of the universe in different\nways, something that must necessarily arise from a common cause”\n(G II 275/AG 181). Since simple substances are minds, their\nmodifications are representations or perceptions, and the activity of\nthe simple substance will relate to the change or succession of its\nperceptions. One way to think of this is that each substance has a\nunique series of perceptions programmed by God to play in harmony with\nall other substances, and the internal tendency of a substance to move\nfrom perception to perception is its active force, or what Leibniz also\ncalls appetite or appetition. \n\nWhile separate entries detail Leibniz's account of causation\nand his account of the mind, it will still be useful to provide a short\nexegesis of Leibniz's celebrated solution to the mind-body\nproblem which Leibniz had inherited from Descartes and his followers.\nThe problem, briefly, is this: if mind is essentially thought (and\nnothing else), and body is essentially extension, then how can mind and\nbody interact or form a unity as we know from experience they must? Or\nhow do thinking substance and extended substance unite in the substance\nof a human being? Leibniz answers this question by, first, denying the\npossibility of the causal interaction of finite substances. In this\nway, Leibniz undermines Cartesian dualism because it takes as a premise\nthe idea that mind-body interaction is to be explained by the influence\nof the one on the other via the pineal gland. (See the Sixth\nMeditation: AT VII 86–87/CSM II 59–60) But Leibniz also saw\npre-established harmony as an account of the mind-body relation that\navoided the difficulties inherent in Occasionalist theories of the mind\nand the interaction of substances. In one of Leibniz's best-known\nmetaphors, he asks his readers to imagine the mind and body as two\npendula hanging from a beam. Whence comes their agreement? One could\nimagine that the motion of the one is communicated through the wooden\nbeam to the other, thus causing them eventually to swing harmoniously\n(the theory of influx). Or one could imagine that God intervenes and\nmoves the pendula, guaranteeing their synchronicity (the theory of\noccasionalism). Or, Leibniz says, one could imagine that God, the\nsupreme artificer, created the world (and the pendula) so perfectly\nthat, by their own natures, they would swing in perfect harmony.\nNaturally, it is this last thesis that Leibniz endorses and asks his\nreaders to endorse as well. (See, for example, the Postscript of a\nLetter to Basnage de Beauval (G IV 498–500/AG 147–49).) \n\nMore precisely, Leibniz argues that God created the world so\nperfectly that each substance acts according to its own law of\nunfolding and is at the same time in perfect harmony with all others\nsubstances; further, that the mind has a distinct point of view of the\nworld by virtue of its being the center of some mass (body), and that\nthe law of unfolding of the mind is in accord with the laws of the\ncorporeal machine. He puts this most succinctly in his 1695 essay,\nA New System of Nature, in which he effectively presents a\nfive-step argument for pre-established harmony: \n\nNow, when Leibniz speaks in metaphysical rigor, he denies the\nunderlying premise of Cartesian dualism: body is not a\nsubstance; so there can be no question of how it qua substance\ninteracts with or is related to the mind, or thinking substance.\nNevertheless, Leibniz was able to express his view for the vulgar\n– that is, for those expecting a Cartesian metaphysics – by\nsaying that the mind and body can be said to form a union and interact\ninsofar as the mind follows its laws, the body follows its laws, and\nthey are in perfect harmony. The body and soul are not united to each\nother in the sense that Descartes had suggested, but the perceptions\nand appetitions of the soul will arise spontaneously from\nits own stores and will correspond to the actions of the body as well\nas to the events of the world. In other words, while the perceptions\nand appetitions of the mind or soul will be independent of the body, they\nwill nevertheless correspond precisely to the actions of the particular\nbody to which it is attached and be in perfect conformity with all the\nother substances of the world. \n\nOn Leibniz's view, to individual substances there belong only\nperceptions and appetitions, and these perceptions and appetitions can\nbe understood to form a series within the individual substance. In\nother words, every individual substance can be thought to have a set\nof perceptions and appetitions such that one could say that, at any\ngiven time, a particular substance was experiencing such-and-such a\nperception and such-and-such an appetition. Indeed, Leibniz's view is\nthat a given substance, x, has, within its individual\nconcept, information of the following sort: x at\ntime t1 will have perception1 and/or\nappetition1; x at t2 will have\nperception2 and/or appetition2; and so on. (In\nfact, the position is more complex; for, as will be shown in a\nsubsequent section, the mind has at any moment an infinity of\npetites perceptions within it, perceptions of everything that\nis occurring in the universe, but the human mind at least will be truly\naware of one thing at a time. For example, the reader of this article\ncould be said to have a temporally-ordered series of perceptions\n– with t1 corresponding to the first sentence,\nt2 the second sentence, etc. – and also\n“background noise” of which the reader is not directly\naware – for example, the sound of an ambulance's siren\ngradually approaching and retreating from t1 to\nt3.) Moreover, the series of perceptions and appetitions are\ngenerated from within the individual substance itself. That is, Leibniz\nspeaks as if perceptions and appetitions follow naturally from prior\nperceptions and appetitions – and it is in this respect, after all,\nthat a finite individual substance is causally independent from all\nother finite created substances. \n\nThe crucial idea is that the body will follow its own laws, the mind\nits own laws, and there will be no true influence between the two. The\nmind and body thus seem to constitute, as it were, worlds apart, as\nindeed Leibniz claims later when he explains the world in terms of\nmonads, and these worlds apart are, according to Leibniz, unified\nsolely by virtue of the correspondence of their actions and\nperceptions. Further, to these separate realms there will apply two\ndistinct means of explaining the events of the world: we may explain\nthings according to the final causes of the mind or according to the\nefficient causes of the body or of bodies in general. Thus, not only do\nthe mind and body each seem to follow a different set of laws, but the\nworld, according to Leibniz, can be described in terms of either set of\nlaws. \n\nLeibniz's account of the pre-established harmony of mind and\nbody is part of a more general position in his metaphysics: the\nexistence of parallel modes of explanation. As we saw above, Leibniz\nbelieves that the mind will act according to its laws and the body\naccording to its laws and the two will be in harmony. But Leibniz also\nbelieves that the mind or soul operates for particular ends and that\ntherefore its actions are explicable in terms of final causes,\nwhereas the actions of the body, purely instances of matter in motion\naccording to the claims of the mechanical philosophy, are to be\nexplained in terms of efficient causes. As he puts it in the\nMonadology §§79 and 81, \n\nAccording to this system, bodies act as if there were no souls\n(though this is impossible); and souls act as if there were no bodies;\nand both act as if each influenced the other. (G VI 620–21/AG 223)\n \n\nIn the realm of natural philosophy, Leibniz will say clearly that\n“all corporeal phenomena can be derived from efficient and\nmechanical causes,” though there are final causes (or\n“higher reasons”) that underlie them. (See Specimen\nDynamicum: GM VI 242/AG 126) But Leibniz pushes the parallelism\neven further: \n\nThough Leibniz speaks here of the kingdoms of power and wisdom, the\ntwo-tiered explanatory approach – the phenomena of the natural\nworld explained through efficient causes and the actions of the mind\nexplained through final causes – leads to the distinction between\nwhat he more commonly calls the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of\ngrace. (See Monadology §87) Thus, on Leibniz's\nview, we can understand the world as if designed by God, the perfect\nengineer or architect, and we can also understand the world as if\nordered and guided by God, the supreme monarch, who is concerned solely\nwith the happiness of his subjects. \n\nThus far we have seen that Leibniz rejected the Cartesian account of\nmatter, according to which matter, the essence of which is extension,\ncould be considered a substance. Leibniz held instead that only beings\nendowed with true unity and capable of action can count as substances.\nThe ultimate expression of Leibniz's view comes in his celebrated\ntheory of monads, in which the only beings that will count as genuine\nsubstances and hence be considered real are mind-like simple substances\nendowed with perception and appetite. What was said above concerning\nthe unity and activity of simple substance should suffice to explain\nLeibniz's reasons for holding such a position. Now a fuller\nversion of Leibniz's idealism must be presented. \n\nAccording to Leibniz, if the only genuinely real beings are\nmind-like simple substances, then bodies, motion, and everything else\nmust result from or be derivative of those simple substances and their\nperceptual states. In a typical statement of his idealism, Leibniz\nsays, “I don't really eliminate body, but reduce\n[revoco] it to what it is. For I show that corporeal mass\n[massa], which is thought to have something over and above\nsimple substances, is not a substance, but a phenomenon resulting from\nsimple substances, which alone have unity and absolute reality”\n(G II 275/AG 181). Yet, this position, denying the reality of bodies and\nasserting that monads are the grounds of all corporeal phenomena, as\nwell as its metaphysical corollaries has shocked many. Bertrand\nRussell, for example, famously remarked in the Preface to his book on\nLeibniz that he felt that “the Monadology was a kind of\nfantastic fairy tale, coherent perhaps, but wholly arbitrary.”\nAnd, in perhaps the wittiest and most biting rhetorical question asked\nof Leibniz, Voltaire gibes, “Can you really believe that a drop\nof urine is an infinity of monads, and that each of these has ideas,\nhowever obscure, of the universe as a whole?” (Oeuvres\ncomplètes, Vol. 22, p. 434) Well, if you are Leibniz, you\ncan. But how so? \n\nWhen Leibniz argues that bodies are the results of monads and that\nmatter itself is a phenomenon, he has something very specific in\nmind. First, in Leibniz's system there is a special kind of order\nin the natural world corresponding to a hierarchy of monads. Consider\nfirst a well-known comment that Leibniz makes to De Volder, introducing\na five-fold ontological scheme: “I distinguish: (1) the primitive\nentelechy or soul; (2) the matter, namely, the primary matter or\nprimitive passive power; (3) the monad made up of these two things; (4)\nthe mass [massa] or secondary matter, or the organic machine in which\ninnumerable subordinate monads come together; and (5) the animal, that\nis, the corporeal substance, which the dominating monad makes into one\nmachine” (G II 252/AG 177). One of the points Leibniz is making\nhere is that in an animal there is a dominant monad that bears a\nspecial relation to all the monads subordinate to it that make the\n“organic machine” of that animal. But, ultimately, the\npicture is even more complex than this, for each of the subordinate\nmonads can be considered as having an organic machine attached to it,\nand this relation continues on to the infinitely small. Thus, for\nexample, Leibniz writes in the Monadology §70,\n“Thus we see that each living body has a dominant entelechy,\nwhich in the animal is the soul; but the limbs of this living body are\nfull of other living beings, plants, animals, each of which also has\nits entelechy, or its dominant soul” (G VI 619/AG 222).\nSimilarly, in a letter to Bierling, he writes, “Any mass contains\ninnumerable monads, for although any one organic body in nature has its\ncorresponding [dominant] monad, it nevertheless contains in its parts\nother monads endowed in the same way with organic bodies subservient to\nthe primary one; and the whole of nature is nothing else, for it is\nnecessary that every aggregate result from simple substances as if from\nelements” (G VII 502). In other words, each monad will have an\norganic body which is in turn composed of other monads, each of which\nlikewise has an organic body. Similarly, any seemingly inanimate chunk\nof matter – a stone or, yes, a drop of urine – will be the\nresult of an infinity of monads and their organic bodies, which are\nnothing more than more monads and their organic bodies. This view is\nassociated with a panorganicist strand of Leibniz's\nthought. And it is for this reason that Leibniz will claim that\n“all of nature is full of life” (Principles of Nature\nand Grace §1: G VI 598/AG 207) and that “there are\ninfinite degrees of life in the monads” (Principles of\nNature and Grace §4: G VI 599/AG 208). \n\nSecond, there is what can best be described as a genuinely idealist\nstrand of Leibniz's thought. That is, if idealism is the thesis that\nthe only things that truly exist are minds and their ideas, then\nLeibniz clearly espouses this doctrine. Here the operative idea is\nthat bodies, and in particular the bodies associated with particular\nminds, are intentional objects – though they result from or are\ngrounded in monads. This is what Leibniz is getting at in the\nfollowing passage from another letter to De Volder: “considering\nthe matter carefully, we must say that there is nothing in things but\nsimple substances, and in them, perception and appetition. Moreover,\nmatter and motion are not substances or things as much as they are the\nphenomena of perceivers, the reality of which is situated in the\nharmony of the perceivers with themselves (at different times) and\nwith other perceivers” (G II 270/AG 181). Thus, the only real\nthings are simple substances; the bodies that we perceive in motion\naround us are phenomena and not themselves substances, though they are\ngrounded ultimately in simple substances or monads. Furthermore, the\nbodies of the natural world ought be considered intentional objects in\nthat they are objects about which we have certain beliefs. This is\nwhat Leibniz means in saying that they have reality insofar as there\nis a harmony between perceivers or between the same perceivers'\nbeliefs or perceptions at different times. In other words, one's body\nor even a stone is real because it is an object of perception that\nfits into an account of the world that is both coherent from the point\nof view of the single perceiver and in harmony with the perceptions of\nother minds. \n\nStill Leibniz's version of idealism tends to produce confusion\nprecisely because of these two strands: the commitment to the\n“embodiment” of monads along with the rejection of the\nreality of bodies; the view that monads are not spatial but have a\npoint of view. Leibniz's point, however, is that, while monads\nare not extended, they do have a situation insofar as they bear an\nordered relation to other bodies through the body in which they are\npresent or through the body to which they represent themselves as being\nattached. (G II 253/AG 178) In other words, in the Leibnizian\nmonadology, simple substances are mind-like entities that do not,\nstrictly speaking, exist in space but that represent the universe from\na unique perspective. \n\nLeibniz's conception of such a perspectival universe has,\nhowever, a distinctively Platonist origin. Again, each mind-like simple\nsubstance represents itself as having a body and a position relative to\nother bodies, but in doing so each simple substance offers a\nperspective on the world for the divine mind. This idea comes out very\nclearly in the Discourse on Metaphysics §14, where\nLeibniz writes the following: \n\nThis is a striking passage. Leibniz is telling us that each finite\nsubstance is the result of a different perspective that God can take of\nthe universe and that each created substance is an emanation of God.\nThe argument here can be expressed in several different ways. First,\nsince God could occupy any and all points of view of the\nuniverse, there must be a simple substance to represent the world from\nthat perspective. (And since the simple substance must have\nrepresentations of its unique perspective, it must be a mind-like\nsubstance, a monad, capable of having perceptions.) Second, and\nstronger, God's omniscience entails knowledge of the world from\nevery perspective simultaneously, and the infinite perspectives of the\nworld originating from God's nature simply are\nmonads. \n\nIf the only things that truly exist are mind-like entities, monads,\nthen the differences between them must be explicable in terms of mental\nfeatures. Now, it was stated above that a central feature of\nLeibniz's account of substance was his claim that substances are\nendowed with active and passive forces. In his mature metaphysics,\nLeibniz expresses this view somewhat differently by saying that a\nsubstance is active insofar as it has distinct perceptions and passive\ninsofar as it has confused perceptions. Thus, for example, in §49\nof the Monadology, Leibniz writes that, “we attribute\naction to a monad insofar as it has distinct perceptions, and\npassion, insofar as it has confused perceptions” (G VI\n615/AG 219). But, as we learn later in the same work, “Monads all\ngo confusedly to infinity, to the whole; but they are limited and\ndifferentiated by the degrees of their distinct perceptions” (G\nVI 617/AG 221). The fundamental idea here is two-fold: first, activity\nand passivity are features of the relative clarity and distinctness of\nthe representations of the monad, and, second, insofar as the organic\nbodies of a particular monad are themselves constituted by monads, they\n– the monads of the organic body – will have confused\nperceptions. This chain goes down to the infinitely small, with monads\nhaving only very confused and inexact perceptions of the world. \n\nSince there is a hierarchy among monads within any animal, from the\nsoul of a person down to the infinitely small monad, the relation of\ndomination and subordination among monads is a crucial feature of both\nLeibniz's idealism and his panorganicism. But the hierarchy of\nsubstances is not simply one of containment, in which one monad has an\norganic body which is the result of other monads, each of which has an\norganic body, and so on. In the case of animals (brutes and human\nbeings), the hierarchy of monads is also related to the\ncontrol of the “machine of nature” (as Leibniz had\nput it in a letter to De Volder considered above). What is it then that\nexplains the relation of dominant and subordinate monads? As Leibniz\ntells Des Bosses, domination and subordination consists of degrees of\nperfection. Since monads are to be differentiated in terms of their\nperceptions, one natural reading would simply be that suggested in the\nparagraph above: monad x is dominant over\nmonad y when x has\nclearer perceptions than y. But, if we follow\nthe description of the appearance of causal interaction that we find in\nthe Monadology (§§49–51), we can get a slightly more\nsophisticated picture. Monad x is dominant\nover monad y when x\ncontains within it reasons for the actions of\ny. This is why the mind of an animal can be\nsaid to direct the actions of its body, and why, for example, there\nwill be a hierarchy of functionality within any one animal. Thus,\none's mind has clearer perceptions than those contained in the\nmonads of its organic body, but it contains the reasons for everything\nthat happens in one's body; one's liver contains the\nreasons for what happens in its cells; a cell contains the reasons for\nwhat happens in its mitochondria; and, according to Leibniz, this\nrelation continues infinitely on down. \n\nLeibniz's reflections on epistemological matters do not rival\nhis reflections on logic, metaphysics, divine justice, and natural\nphilosophy in terms of quantity. Nevertheless, he did think deeply\nabout the possibility and nature of human knowledge, and his main\ndoctrines will be presented here. \n\nIn 1684, Leibniz published a short treatise with the above title. It\nwas his first mature publication and one to which he often referred\nin the course of his philosophical career. In it, Leibniz sets out a series of\ndistinctions for human knowledge or cognition (cognitio):\nknowledge is either obscure or clear; clear knowledge is either\nconfused or distinct; distinct knowledge is either inadequate or\nadequate; and adequate knowledge is either symbolic or intuitive. Now,\naccording to Leibniz, clear knowledge means being able to recognize\nsomething that is represented to us, for example, a rose; and knowledge\nis both clear and distinct when one can enumerate marks sufficient to\ndistinguish a rose from other things. When one can give such an\nenumeration, one possesses a distinct notion or concept and is thus able to give a\nnominal definition of the thing. Further, if all the marks\nthat form part of a distinct notion are themselves distinctly known,\nthen the cognition is adequate. And, finally, if a notion is complex\nand we are able to consider all its component notions simultaneously,\nthen our knowledge of it is intuitive. Ultimately, Leibniz holds that\nhuman beings have intuitive knowledge only of primary notions and\npropositions, whereas God, of course, has intuitive knowledge of all\nthings. \n\nLeibniz believes his distinctions also serve to show the difference\nbetween true and false ideas. “An idea is true,” he writes,\n“when its notion is possible and false when it includes a\ncontradiction” (A VI iv 589/AG 26). Now, possibility can be\nestablished a priori and a posteriori. On the one\nhand, we can know a priori that something is possible if we\ncan resolve it into its component notions which are themselves possible\nand if we know that there is no incompatibility among those component\nnotions. On the other hand, we know a posteriori that\nsomething is possible merely through experience, for the actual\nexistence of a thing is proof of its possibility. \n\nWhile Leibniz's Principle of Contradiction and Principle of Sufficient\nReason were discussed above, it was not mentioned that these two\nprinciples are employed in the service of Leibniz's distinction\nbetween truths of reasoning and truths of fact, that\nis, between necessary truths and contingent truths.\nLeibniz's account of modality is treated elsewhere, but a\nshort account of this distinction is here required. In the case of a\ntruth of reasoning, its reason or explanation can be discovered by\nanalysis of the notions or concepts, “resolving it into simpler ideas and\nsimpler truths until we reach the primitives” (G VI 612/AG 217).\nUltimately, all truths of reasoning will be resolvable into primitives\nor identities, and the Principle of Contradiction is thereby\noperative. In the case of a truth of fact, on the other hand, its\nreason cannot be discovered through a finite process of\nanalysis or resolution of notions. However, there must be a reason\nthat some particular fact is so and not otherwise (PSR), and,\naccording to Leibniz, this reason is found outside the series of\ncontingent things. (See below.) \n\nLeibniz is often put in the camp of rationalists and opposed to the\nempiricists (for example, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume). While there are\ngood grounds to be unhappy with this standard textbook distinction,\nLeibniz does fit the bill in two important respects: he is a\nrationalist insofar as he holds to the Principle of Sufficient Reason,\nand he is a rationalist insofar as he accepts innate ideas and denies\nthat the mind is at birth a tabula rasa or blank slate. In\nterms of Leibniz's classical allegiances, it is interesting to see\nthat in the realm of metaphysics, he often couched his philosophy in\nAristotelian (and Scholastic) terms but that in the realm of\nepistemology, he was a fairly open Platonist – at least in terms\nof the existence of innate ideas. Indeed, in the opening passages of\nhis New Essays on Human Understanding, his book-length\ncommentary on Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding,\nLeibniz explicitly aligns himself with Plato on the fundamental\nquestion of the origin of ideas. (A VI vi 48/RB 48) \n\nLeibniz has several straightforwardly metaphysical\nreasons for denying that the mind could be a tabula rasa.\nFirst, and most obvious, since there can be no genuine causal\ninteraction among substances, then there could be no way that all our\nideas could come from experience; indeed, no ideas could, strictly\nspeaking, come from experience. (Leibniz will, however, adopt a more\nliberal understanding of sense experience, so that this is not mooted\ntout court.) But, second, and rarely remarked upon, Leibniz\nbelieves that the view that our minds are blank slates at birth violates\nthe Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles. In short, PII works\nagainst qualitatively identical physical atoms and against\nqualitatively identical (because blank) souls. Further, in one\ntelling passage, he shows us the metaphysical underpinnings of the\nempiricist view that he finds so objectionable. He writes,\n“Experience is necessary, I admit, if the soul is to be given\nsuch and such thoughts, and if it is to take heed of the ideas that are\nwithin us. But how could experience and the senses provide the ideas?\nDoes the soul have windows? Is it similar to writing-tablets, or like\nwax? Clearly, those who take this view of the soul are treating it as\nfundamentally corporeal” (A VI vi 110/RB 110). Locke famously\nentertained the possibility of “thinking matter”, and\nLeibniz found such a thesis abhorrent. Throughout his career, Leibniz\nexpresses no doubt that the human mind or soul is essentially\nimmaterial, and Locke's skepticism about the nature of substance\nis fundamentally at odds with Leibniz's most deeply held\nphilosophical commitments. But, of course, the consequence of this is\nthat Leibniz seeks to undermine Locke's position with respect to\nthe origin and nature of ideas. That the mind, according to Leibniz,\nmust be essentially immaterial has been shown above in the\nsection on metaphysics. But Leibniz does have a particular argument for\nthe mind's immateriality or against its mechanism that concerns\nthe nature of thought and ideas. This is his famous metaphor of a mill,\nwhich comes forth both in the New Essays and the\nMonadology. According to Leibniz, perceptions cannot be\nexplained in mechanical or materialistic terms. Even if one were to\ncreate a machine to which one attributes thought and the presence of\nperceptions, inspection of the interior of this machine would not show\nthe experience of thoughts or perceptions, only the motions of\nvarious parts. \n\nBut even when Leibniz accepts the common way of speaking – that\nis, as if the senses are causally responsible for some ideas – he\nhas arguments against the empiricist claim that the senses are the\norigin of all ideas. According to Leibniz, while the\nempiricist position can explain the source of contingent truths, it\ncannot adequately explain the origin and character of necessary truths.\nFor the senses could never arrive at the universality of any necessary\ntruth; they can, at best, provide us with the means of making a\nrelatively strong induction. Rather, it is the understanding itself,\nLeibniz claims, which is the source of such truths and which guarantees\ntheir very necessity. While we are not aware of all our ideas at any\ntime – a fact demonstrated by the function and role of memory\n– certain ideas or truths are in our minds as dispositions or\ntendencies. This is what is meant by an innate idea or an innate truth.\nIndeed, Leibniz believes that the mind has a “special\naffinity” for necessary truths. On this subject, Leibniz uses a\ndistinctive metaphor: a piece of marble has veins that indicate or are\ndisposed to indicate shapes that a skillful sculptor can discover and exploit.\nSimilarly, there is a “disposition, an aptitude, a preformation,\nwhich determines our soul and brings it about that [necessary truths]\nare derivable from it” (A VI vi 80/RB 80).  \n\nThe hierarchy of monads mentioned above has a corollary in\nLeibniz's epistemology. Monads are more or less perfect depending\nupon the clarity of their perceptions, and a monad is dominant over\nanother when the one contains reasons for what happens in the other.\nBut some monads can also rise to the level of souls when, for\nexample, they experience sensations, that is, when their\nperceptions are very distinct and accompanied by memory. This is a\nposition occupied by animals. Furthermore, some souls are sometimes\nalso in a position to engage in apperception, that is, to\nreflect on their inner states or perceptions. As Leibniz tells us in\nthe Principles of Nature and Grace, “it is good to\ndistinguish between perception, which is the internal state of\nthe monad representing external things, and apperception,\nwhich is consciousness, or the reflective knowledge of this\ninternal state, something not given to all souls, nor at all times to a\ngiven soul” (G VI 600/AG 208). The point that Leibniz wants to\nmake is clearly an anti-Cartesian one: it is not the case that animals\nlack souls and are mere machines. There is a continuum here from God,\nangels, and human beings through animals to stones and the dull monads\nwhich underlie the muck and grime of the world; and this continuum is\nnot solely to be understood in terms of the comparative clarity of the\nmind's perceptions but also in terms of the kinds of mental\nactivity possible for a particular being. Indeed, according to Leibniz,\nanimals operate not as mere automata as they do in the Cartesian\nphilosophy, but rather have fairly sophisticated mental faculties. Even\na dog, for example, is capable, by virtue of its memory, of having a\nperception of a prior perception: “[t]hat is why a dog runs away\nfrom the stick with which he was beaten, because his memory represents\nto him the pain which the stick caused him” (G VI 600/AG 208).\nWhile this resembles reasoning, it is not the kind of reasoning that\nhuman beings are capable of; for the mental processes of the dog are\n“only founded in the memory of facts or effects, and not\nat all in the knowledge of causes” (ibid.). At the same\ntime, Leibniz is quick to add that the mental activity of the dog is\nthe same as the mental activity of human beings in three\nfourths of their actions, for most of us most of the time are not\nactually reasoning from causes to effects. And yet we are different\nfrom the beasts, Leibniz believes. Some creatures are capable of\nknowing the necessary and eternal truths of logic and mathematics and\na priori truths (from cause to effect), and they “are\nproperly called rational animals, and their souls are called\nminds.” (G VI 601/AG 209) As Leibniz says, “These\nsouls are capable of performing reflective acts, and capable of\nconsidering what is called ”I“, substance, soul, mind\n– in brief, immaterial things and immaterial truths. And that is\nwhat makes us capable of the sciences of demonstrative\nknowledge” (ibid.). Thus, what makes human beings (and higher\nminds) special is the capacity, via apperception, to formulate a\nconception of the self. Indeed, as we see in this passage,\nLeibniz suggests that rationality itself follows from the capacity for\nreflection: we begin with a conception of the self; we move from this\npoint to thinking of being, of substance, of God; and we become aware\nas well of eternal and necessary truths. Rationality, however, is\nreally only the ability to form “indubitable connection[s] of\nideas” and to follow them to their “infallible\nconsequences” (ibid.). In other words, animals and most human\nbeings most of the time are purely empiricists; a rational person,\nhowever, is one who can engage in genuine a priori reasoning,\nmoving from knowledge of a true cause via deduction to necessary\neffects. \n\nOne of the fundamental theses of Leibniz's philosophy is that\neach substance expresses the entire universe. In order to incorporate\nthis thesis into his general epistemology and philosophy of mind,\nLeibniz develops his account of “petites\nperceptions” or “minute perceptions” mentioned\nbriefly in the section on pre-established harmony. As he puts it in the\nPreface to the New Essays, “at every moment there is in\nus an infinity of perceptions, unaccompanied by awareness or\nreflection; that is, of alterations in the soul itself, of which we are\nunaware because these impressions are either too minute and too\nnumerous, or else too unvarying, so that they are not sufficiently\ndistinctive on their own” (A VI vi 53/RB 53). In other words,\neverything that takes place in the universe really is expressed by each\nfinite mind, but the infinite perceptions present in the mind –\nfrom the butterfly's flight in the Amazonian jungle to the\npenguin's waddling in Antarctica – are usually too minute\nor too indistinct to outweigh, for example, the appearance of this\ncomputer screen or the feeling of hunger. Indeed, this infinity of\nperceptions is likened by Leibniz to the roar of the sea. “To\nhear this noise as we do,” Leibniz says, “we must hear the\nparts which make up this whole, that is the noise of each wave,\nalthough each of these little noises makes itself known only when\ncombined confusedly with all the others, and would not be noticed if\nthe wave which made it were by itself” (A VI vi 54/RB 54). The\ninfinity of petites perceptions is, then, simply epistemological white\nnoise. \n\nFor Leibniz, the simplicity and unity of the mind still allows for the\nmultiplicity of perceptions and appetitions. The multiplicity, however,\nshould not only be interpreted as diachronous but also\nsynchronous; that is, the mind despite its simplicity and\nunity has within it at any time an infinity of different\npetites perceptions. A human being, in a waking state, is\nconscious of particular perceptions, but never all. And here we see\nthat Leibniz's doctrine is important, insofar as it offers a\ncontrast to the Cartesian theory of the mind. According to Leibniz, the\nmind is always active, for there are always perceptions\npresent to it, even if those perceptions are minute and do not rise to\nsuch a level that we are cognizant of them. Thus, even in a deep and\ndreamless sleep, the mind is active, and perceptions are in the mind.\nMoreover, if Descartes really did advocate the perfect transparency of\nthe mind, then it should be clear that Leibniz allows for a subtler\npicture of mental contents: there are many things in the mind that are\nconfused and minute and to which we do not always have complete\naccess. \n\nLeibniz, however, does not simply disagree with Locke about the\nnature of the mind and the possibility of innate ideas. It is also\nLeibniz's contention that human beings are capable of knowledge\nin a way that Locke had clearly denied. As shown above, Leibniz is\nconvinced that our knowledge of necessary truths has a completely\ndifferent foundation from that for which Locke argues. Similarly,\nLeibniz holds that we can have genuine knowledge of the real essences\nof things, something called into question by Locke. After all, Locke\nhad argued that we ought to admit that “essence” is really\njust a word that we use to describe “nominal essence,” a\nset of sortal concepts based upon sensible qualities; we ought not to\nact as if “essence” means anything about the real or inner\nconstitution of a thing, for we will remain ignorant of that. Leibniz,\nhowever, holds that we can know certain things not only about\nindividuals but also about their species and genera. In Book IV of the\nNew Essays, in which Philalethes – the Locke character\n– gives his critique of the possibility of our certain knowledge\nabout substances qua natural kinds, Theophilus (Leibniz) says,\n“[L]et me tell you that there are, for example, hundreds of\ntruths that we can be certain of concerning gold, i.e. that body whose\ninner essence reveals itself through the greatest weight known here on\nearth, or through the greatest ductility or by other marks. For we can\nsay that the body with the greatest known ductility is also the\nheaviest of all known bodies” (A VI vi 400/RB 400). Earlier in\nthe New Essays, Leibniz had said that “essence is\nfundamentally nothing but the possibility of the thing under\nconsideration” (A VI vi 293/RB 293) and “essences are\neverlasting because they only concern possibilities” (A VI vi\n296/RB 296). It would seem, then, that Leibniz has something like the\nfollowing in mind: experience informs us of a certain consistent set of\nsensible properties in, for example, gold; that is, a certain set of\nproperties is compossible. And, more important, we ought to be\nable to assert with certainty that if some object has the greatest\nductility, then it also has the greatest weight. \n\nLike most of his great contemporaries (Descartes, Spinoza,\nMalebranche), Leibniz developed a number of arguments for the existence\nof God. Two of these are presented in condensed versions in the\nMonadology §§36–45, as a priori and a\nposteriori arguments (or ontological and cosmological arguments,\nto borrow Kant's terminology). But they have long histories in\nLeibniz's thought. Yet, unlike Descartes and Spinoza at least,\nLeibniz also expended great efforts in explaining and justifying\nGod's justice and benevolence in this world. In other words,\nLeibniz was keen to answer the problem of evil. His work on this\nsubject led to his thesis, so roundly mocked in Voltaire's\nCandide, that we live in the best of all possible\nworlds. \n\nLeibniz made an important contribution to the history of the\nontological argument. His reflections on this form of argument go back\nto the 1670s, and we know that he shared his thoughts on this matter\nwith Spinoza when Leibniz visited him on the way to Hanover. According\nto Leibniz, the argument that Descartes gives implicitly in the Fifth\nMeditation and explicitly in the First Set of Replies is\nfaulty. Descartes had argued that God is a being having all\nperfections, existence is a perfection, therefore, God exists. (AT VII\n118–19/CSM II 84–85) But, Leibniz thinks, one needs to show that it is\npossible for such a being to exist, that is, that it is\npossible for all perfections to co-exist in one being. If this is so,\nthen and only then an ens perfectissimum can be said to exist.\nIn his short essay That a Most Perfect Being Exists\n(Quod ens perfectissimum existit) from 1676, Leibniz\nargues just this. He defines a “perfection” as a\n“simple quality which is positive and absolute, or, which\nexpresses without any limits whatever it does express” (A VI iii\n578/SR 101). And with this definition in hand, Leibniz is then able to\nclaim that there can be no inconsistency among perfections, since a\nperfection, in being simple and positive, is unanalyzable and incapable\nof being enclosed by limits. That is, if A and B are perfections, then\nthe proposition “A and B are incompatible” cannot be\ndemonstrated because A and B are simples, nor can the proposition be\nknown per se. Therefore, it is possible that any and all perfections\nare in fact compatible. And, therefore, Leibniz reasons, a subject of\nall perfections, or an ens perfectissimum, is indeed\npossible. \n\nBut this argument by itself is not sufficient to determine that God\nnecessarily exists. Leibniz must also show that existence is itself a\nperfection, so that a being having all perfections, an ens\nperfectissimum, may be said to exist. More exactly, Leibniz needs\nto show that necessary existence belongs to the essence of\nGod. And this he does in another short piece from this period, writing\n“Again, a necessary being is the same as a being from whose\nessence existence follows. For a necessary being is one which\nnecessarily exists, such that for it not to exist would imply a\ncontradiction, and so would conflict with the concept or essence of\nthis being” (A VI iii 583/SR 107). In other words, if it is the\ncase that a necessary being is the same thing as a being whose\nexistence follows from its essence, then existence must in fact be one\nof its essential properties. Leibniz continues in this short\nreflection, “And so existence belongs to its concept or essence.\nFrom this we have a splendid theorem, which is the pinnacle of modal\ntheory and by which one moves in a wonderful way from potentiality to\nact: If a necessary being is possible, it follows that it exists\nactually, or, that such a being is actually found in the\nuniverse” (A VI iii 583/SR 107). The “pinnacle of Modal\nTheory” that Leibniz mentions here is none other than one of the\nnotorious axioms of the modal logic S5:\n◊□p → □p. In short,\nLeibniz's argument is the following: \n\nIt should be noted that Leibniz's argument bears a certain\naffinity with the ontological argument that Gödel gives, insofar\nas it also seeks to demonstrate the possibility of a being having all\nsimple, positive properties. (For Gödel's argument, see the\n entry on  \n ontological arguments.) \n\nAs we have seen, the Principle of Sufficient Reason is one of the\nbedrock principles of all of Leibniz's philosophy. In the\nMonadology, Leibniz appeals to PSR, saying that even in the\ncase of contingent truths or truths of fact there must be a sufficient\nreason why they are so and not otherwise. (Monadology\n§36) But, since each particular truth of fact is contingent upon\nsome other (prior) truth of fact, the reason for the entire series of\ntruths must be located outside the series, and this ultimate reason is\nwhat we call God. (Monadology §37) \n\nIn the Theodicy, Leibniz fills out this argument with a\nfascinating account of the nature of God. First, insofar as the first\ncause of the entire series must have been able to survey all other\npossible worlds, it has understanding. Second, insofar as it was able\nto select one world among the infinity of possible worlds, it has a\nwill. Third, insofar as it was able to bring about this world, it has\npower. (Leibniz adds here that “power relates to being,\nwisdom or understanding to truth, and will to\ngood.”) Fourth, insofar as the first cause relates to\nall possibles, its understanding, will and power are infinite. And,\nfifth, insofar as everything is connected together, there is no reason\nto suppose more than one God. Thus, Leibniz is able to\ndemonstrate the uniqueness of God, his omniscience,\nomnipotence, and benevolence from the twin assumptions of the\ncontingency of the world and the Principle of Sufficient Reason.\n(Theodicy §7: G VI 106–07/H 127–28)\nNaturally, if one were deny the existence of possible worlds in the\nsense conceived by Leibniz or deny PSR (by, say, admitting\n“brute facts”), then one would hardly be moved by this\nkind of argument. \n\nLeibniz's account of the nature of possible worlds is dealt\nwith in a separate entry. Here the following simple question will be\naddressed: How can this world be the best of all possible worlds? After\nall, as Voltaire brought out so clearly in Candide, it\ncertainly seems that this world, in which one finds no short supply of\nnatural and moral horrors, is far from perfect – indeed, it seems\npretty lousy. Certainly only a fool could believe that it is the best\nworld possible. But, Leibniz speaks on behalf of the fool, with an\nargument that has essentially the following structure: \n\nIn other words, Leibniz seems to argue that, if one is to hold the\ntraditional theistic conception of God and believe that one\ncan meaningfully assert that the world could have been other than it\nis, then one must hold that this world is the best possible.\nNaturally, this argument is simply the Christian retort to the\nEpicurean argument against theism. \n\nBut what are the criteria by which one can say that this world is\nthe best? It should be clear that Leibniz nowhere says that\nthis argument implies that everything has to be wonderful. Indeed,\nLeibniz is squarely in the tradition of all Christian apologists going\nback to Augustine, arguing that we cannot have knowledge of the whole\nof the world and that even if a piece of the mosaic that is\ndiscoverable to us is ugly the whole may indeed have great beauty.\nStill, Leibniz does offer at least two considerations relevant to the\ndetermination of the happiness and perfection of the world. He tells us\nin the Discourse on Metaphysics, first, that\n“…the happiness of minds is the principal aim of\nGod…” (A VI iv 1537/AG 38) and, second, that “God\nhas chosen the most perfect world, that is, the one which is at the\nsame time the simplest in hypotheses and the richest in\nphenomena” (A VI iv 1538/AG 39). So, is this world of genocide\nand natural disaster better than a world containing only one\nmultifoliate rose? Yes, because the former is a world in which an\ninfinity of minds perceive and reflect on the diversity of phenomena\ncaused by a modest number of simple laws. To the more difficult\nquestion whether there is a better world with perhaps a little less\ngenocide and natural disaster Leibniz can only respond that, if so, God\nwould have brought it into actuality. And this, of course, is to say\nthat there really is no better possible world.","contact.mail":"look@uky.edu","contact.domain":"uky.edu"}]
