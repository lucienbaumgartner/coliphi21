They come in a variety\nof syntactic categories in English, but determiners like\n“all”, “each”, “some”,\n“many”, “most”, and “few” provide\nsome of the most common examples of\n quantification.[1]\n In English, they combine with singular or plural nouns, sometimes\nqualified by adjectives or relative clauses, to form explicitly\nrestricted quantifier phrases such as “some apples”,\n“every material object”, or “most planets”.\nThese quantifier phrases may in turn combine with predicates in order\nto form sentences such as “some apples are delicious”,\n“every material object is extended”, or “most\nplanets are visible to the naked eye”. We may conceive of\ndeterminers like “every” and “some” as binary\nquantifiers of the form \\(Q(A,B)\\), which may operate on two\npredicates, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), in order to form a sentence.\n\n\nBinary quantifiers of this sort played an important role in what is\nperhaps the first formal study of quantification developed by\nAristotle in the Prior Analytics. The details of\nAristotle’s syllogistic logic are given in the entry on\n Aristotle’s Logic.\n Aristotle investigated a restricted class of inferential patterns,\nwhich he called syllogisms, in which two categorical\npropositions served as premises and a third served as a\nconclusion. A categorical proposition is a sentence obtained from one\nof the four binary quantifiers “\\(all(A, B)\\)”,\n“\\(some(A, B)\\)”, “\\(no(A, B)\\)” and\n“\\(not \\ all(A, B)\\)”, when suitable predicates are\nsubstituted for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In a syllogism, each categorical\nproposition contains two of three shared predicates. The logical\nrelations, which, according to Aristotelian logic, obtain between them\nare codified by\n the square of opposition.\n Although Aristotle’s syllogistic logic dominated logic for\ncenturies, it eventually revealed itself inadequate for the\nrepresentation of mathematical argumentation, and it finally became\ndisplaced by the advent of modern quantificational logic, which\noriginated with George Boole’s algebraic approach to logic and\nGottlob Frege’s approach to logic and quantification (1879).\n\n\nModern quantificational logic has chosen to focus instead on formal\ncounterparts of the unary quantifiers “everything” and\n“something”, which may be written \\(\\forall x\\) and\n\\(\\exists x\\), respectively. They are unary quantifiers because they\nrequire a single argument in order to form a sentence of the form\n\\(\\forall x \\ A\\) or \\(\\exists x \\ A\\). Frege (and Russell) devised an\ningenious procedure for regimenting binary quantifiers like\n“every” and “some” in terms of unary\nquantifiers like “everything” and “something”:\nthey formalized sentences of the form \\(\\ulcorner\\)Some \\(A\\) is\n\\(B\\)\\(\\urcorner\\) and \\(\\ulcorner\\)Every \\(A\\) is \\(B\\)\\(\\urcorner\\)\nas \\(\\exists x (Ax \\wedge Bx)\\) and \\(\\forall x (Ax \\rightarrow Bx)\\),\nrespectively. They analyzed a sentence like “some apples are\ndelicious” in terms of the sentence “something is an apple\nand delicious”, whereas they parsed the sentence “every\nmaterial object is extended” as “everything is extended,\nif it is a material object”. Unfortunately, this procedure\ncannot be generalized to cover quantifier phrases like\n“many”, “most”, or “few”. It would\nbe a mistake to regiment the sentence “most planets are visible\nto the naked eye” by means of “most things are planets and\nvisible to the naked eye” or “most things are such that\nthey are visible to the naked eye, if they are planets”.\nInstead, they are better analyzed as irreducibly binary quantifiers,\nand their study has given rise to the theory of generalized\nquantifiers, which has become a fruitful subject of study partly\nbecause of its applications in the semantics of natural language.\n\nWhat is now a commonplace treatment of quantification began with Frege\n(1879), where the German philosopher and mathematician, Gottlob Frege,\ndevised a formal language equipped with quantifier symbols, which\nbound different styles of variables. He formulated axioms and rules of\ninference, which allowed him to represent a remarkable range of\nmathematical argumentation. Classical quantificational logic is\nsometimes known as “first-order” or\n“predicate” logic, which is generally taken to include\nfunctional and constant symbols. The vocabulary of classical\nquantificational logic is often supplemented with an identity\npredicate to yield the classical theory of quantification with\nidentity. \nAt the core of classical quantificational logic lies what we may call\npure quantificational logic, which makes no provision for any singular\nterms other than variables. In pure quantificational logic, one may\nstill make use of Russell’s theory of definite description to\nsimulate singular terms for which we have a method of contextual\nelimination. \nThe vocabulary of pure quantificational logic contains the usual\npropositional connectives: \\(\\lnot\\), \\(\\wedge\\), \\(\\vee\\),\n\\(\\rightarrow\\), and \\(\\leftrightarrow\\). It contains predicate\nletters of various sorts: one-place predicate letters with or without\nsubscripts, \\(P^{1}, Q^{1}, R^{1}, P^{1}_{1}\\), …, two-place\npredicate letters, \\(P^{2}, Q^{2}, R^{2}, P^{2}_{1}\\), …, and\nmore generally, \\(n\\)-place predicate letters. Sentence letters are\n0-place predicates. There is, in addition to this, an infinite stock\nof variables with or without subscripts: \\(x, y, z, x_1, y_1, z_1\\),\n… , and two quantifiers \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\). In a\nclassical framework, we need not treat all these symbols as primitive;\nwe may, for example, treat \\(\\lnot\\), \\(\\rightarrow\\), and \\(\\forall\\)\nas primitive and provide standard definitions for the other\npropositional connectives and quantifiers in terms of them. For\nexample, the existential quantifier, \\(\\exists x \\ A\\), may be\ndefined: \\(\\lnot \\forall x \\ \\lnot A\\). \nThe definition of a formula of the language of pure quantificational\nlogic proceeds recursively as follows. First, one defines an\natomic formula to consist of an \\(n\\)-place predicate\nfollowed by \\(n\\) variables: \\(P^{n}_{i} x_{1}\\), …, \\(x_{n}\\).\nOne then defines \\(A\\) to be a formula of the language of pure\nquantificational logic if, and only if, (i) \\(A\\) is an atomic\nformula, or (ii) \\(A\\) is of the form \\(\\lnot B\\), where \\(B\\) is a\nformula, or (iii) \\(A\\) is of the form \\((B \\rightarrow C)\\), where\n\\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are each a formula, or (iv) \\(A\\) is of the form\n\\(\\forall x \\ B\\), where \\(x_i\\) is a variable and \\(B\\) is a\n formula.[2] \nAll occurrences of variables in an atomic formula are free.\nThe free occurrences of variables in the negation of a formula \\(\\lnot\nB\\) are the free occurrences of variables in \\(B\\). The free\noccurrences of variables in a formula of the form \\((B \\rightarrow\nC)\\) are the free occurrences of variables in \\(B\\) and \\(C\\).\nFinally, the free occurrences of variables in a quantified formula\n\\(\\forall x \\ B\\) are the variables other than \\(x\\) that are free in\n\\(B\\). We call \\(B\\) the scope of the initial occurrence of the\nquantifier \\(\\forall x\\) in \\(\\forall x \\ B\\). If an occurrence of a\nvariable is not free in a formula \\(A\\), then it is bound; all\noccurrences of \\(x\\) in \\(B\\) are bound in the quantified formula\n\\(\\forall x \\ B\\). In fact, we will often write that they lie within\nthe scope of the initial quantifier. \nA formula \\(A\\) is closed if, and only if, all of its\nvariables are bound. Otherwise, \\(A\\) is open. A variable\n\\(y\\) is free for \\(x\\) if, and only if, no free occurrences\nof \\(x\\) lies within the scope of a quantification on \\(y\\), \\(\\forall\ny\\). We write \\(A(y/x)\\) for the formula that results from \\(A\\) when\nevery free occurrence of \\(x\\) in \\(A\\) is replaced by an occurrence\nof the variable \\(y\\). A sentence is a closed formula of the\nlanguage. \nFrege’s Begriffsschrift develops a formal system, which\nincludes axioms for quantification over individual objects and\nconcepts. For Frege, objects are the appropriate values for singular\nvariables, and a concept is what is referred to by a predicate. Notice\nthat despite Frege’s use of the term, concepts, for him, are\nnothing like mental constructs, but rather objective constituents of\nthe world. In particular, concepts are functions, which map objects\ninto truth values. Since a predicate like “is extended” is\ntrue of some objects and false of others, Frege takes the concept\nbeing extended to assign truth to an object if, and only if,\nit is extended. \nFrege’s system is an axiomatization of what has come to be known\nas second-order logic, which is an important extension of classical\nquantificational logic. Hilbert & Ackermann (1928) contains the\nfirst axiomatic treatment of quantificational logic as a subject of\nits own, which they called “the narrower functional\ncalculus”. In what follows, we look at what is now a common\naxiomatization of pure quantificational logic. This axiom system\nadopts all tautologies of propositional logic as axioms and modus\nponens as a rule of inference, and it supplements them with two\nmore axiom schemata and a rule of universal generalization. The first\ntwo axiom schemata are: \nThe first axiom, (\\(\\forall 1\\)), is commonly known as the axiom of\nuniversal instantiation. To complete the axiomatization, we\nneed to add a rule of universal generalization: \nSince \\(\\exists x \\ A\\) abbreviates \\(\\lnot \\forall x \\lnot \\ A\\), we\nhave a principle of existential generalization: \nThis principle is not without consequence. Since, for example, \\(Px\n\\rightarrow Px\\) is a tautology, which is available as an axiom, the\ncombination with modus ponens and existential generalization\nyields \\(\\exists x (Px \\rightarrow Px)\\) as a theorem. For another\ncontroversial example, consider the theorem \\(\\forall x \\ Px\n\\rightarrow \\exists x \\ Px\\), which is similarly derivable from the\naxioms by combining universal instantiation and existential\ngeneralization. Some have found these consequences objectionable on\nthe grounds that the existence of an object should not be derivable\nfrom logic alone. \nThe interpretation of the language of pure quantificational logic\nrequires one to specify both a domain for the variables to range over\nand an extension for each non-logical predicate of the language.\nAlfred Tarski developed what is now known as a model theory for a wide\nrange of formal languages. We recall some definitions from the entry\non\n model theory.\n A model for the language of pure quantificational logic is an ordered\npair, \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\), where \\(D\\) is a non-empty set, and\n\\(I\\) is an interpretation function, which maps each \\(n\\)-place\npredicate of the language into a set of ordered \\(n\\)-tuples of\nobjects in the set \\(D\\). \\(D\\) provides the domain of discourse for\nthe quantifier, and \\(I\\) provides each predicate of the language with\nan extension: one-place predicates are mapped into subsets of \\(D\\),\ntwo-place predicates are mapped into sets of ordered pairs of members\nof \\(D\\), and more generally, \\(n\\)-place predicates are mapped into\nsets of \\(n\\)-tuples of members of \\(D\\). \nTruth in a model is then defined in terms of satisfaction. A variable\nassignment \\(s\\) for the model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) is a function\nfrom the set of variables of the language into the domain \\(D\\). A\nformula \\(A\\) is satisfied in a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by an\nassignment \\(s\\) of objects to variables. If \\(s\\) is a variable\nassignment for \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\), we write \\(s[x/d]\\) to specify\na variable assignment, which is just like \\(s\\) except perhaps for the\nfact that it assigns object \\(d\\) in \\(D\\) to the variable \\(x\\). \nWe define a formula to be satisfied in a model \\(\\langle D, I\n\\rangle\\) by an assignment \\(s\\) recursively as follows. An atomic\nformula \\(P^{n}_{i} x_{1}, \\ldots , x_{n}\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle\nD, I\\rangle\\) by \\(s\\) if, and only if, \\(\\langle s(x_{1}), \\ldots,\ns(x_{n})\\rangle \\in I(P^{n}_{i})\\), which means that the \\(n\\)-tuple\nof objects \\(s\\) assigns to the variables that occur in the formula is\nin the interpretation of the predicate \\(P^{n}_{i}\\) under \\(I\\). A\nnegation \\(\\lnot B\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by \\(s\\)\nif, and only if, \\(B\\) is not satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by\n\\(s\\). A conditional \\((B \\rightarrow C)\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle\nD, I\\rangle\\) by \\(s\\) if, and only if, \\(B\\) is not satisfied or\n\\(C\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by \\(s\\). Finally,\n\\(\\forall x \\ B\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by \\(s\\) if,\nand only if, \\(B\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by all\nassignments of the form \\(s[x/d]\\), where \\(d\\) is a member of the\ndomain \\(D\\). \nA formula \\(A\\) is true in a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\)\nif, and only if, \\(A\\) is satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) under\nall assignments for the model. A formula \\(A\\) is valid if,\nand only if, \\(A\\) is true in all models. \nThe Tarskian model theory for pure quantificational logic gives us\nexactly what we want. Since the axioms of pure quantificational logic\nare valid and the rules of inference preserve validity, all theorems\nof pure quantificational logic are valid.\n (Soundness).[3]\n One may in addition, prove that all valid formulas are, in fact,\nderivable from the axioms of pure quantificational logic.\n(Completeness). The entry on\n classical logic\n outlines a proof. \nCall a set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) satisfiable if, and only\nif, there is a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) and a variable assignment\n\\(s\\), which satisfies each formula \\(A\\) in \\(\\Gamma\\) in the model.\nA set \\(\\Gamma\\) of formulas is satisfiable if, and only if, every\nfinite subset of \\(\\Gamma\\) is satisfiable. (Compactness).\nThis is a simple corollary of Completeness. \nA simple version of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem states that if a\nset of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) has an infinite model, then it has a\ndenumerable model, where a denumerable model is one whose\ndomain is no larger than the set of natural numbers. There is a\ngeneralized form as well. If we let the cardinality \\(\\kappa\\) of the\nnon-logical vocabulary be greater than \\(\\aleph_0\\), which is the\ncardinality of the set of natural numbers, then if \\(\\Gamma\\) has an\ninfinite model, then it has a model of cardinality \\(\\kappa\\). \nModel-theoretic interpretations are sets: a model is an ordered pair\nof a non-empty set and an interpretation function. But since modern\n set theory\n proves that there is no universal set, no model can ever interpret\nthe quantifiers by means of a universal domain of discourse. It may\nseem, then, that there are interpretations of the language of pure\nquantificational logic to which no model corresponds. And this raises\nthe question of whether truth in all models may fall short of truth\nunder all interpretations of the language. \nFortunately, there is an elegant argument due to Georg Kreisel (1967),\nwhich tells us that we can safely restrict attention to set-based\nmodels for the specification of the set of validities of pure\nquantificational logic: a formula \\(A\\) of the language of\nquantificational logic is true under every interpretation of the\nlanguage if, and only if, it is true in every model. The argument is a\nsimple application of Completeness. If \\(A\\) is true under every\ninterpretation, whether it is a model or not, then \\(A\\) will be true\nin every model. The challenge, however, is to argue for the converse.\nBut if \\(A\\) is true in every model, then, by Completeness, \\(A\\) is a\ntheorem of pure quantificational logic. And since every theorem is\npresumably true under every interpretation, not just model-theoretic\nones, it follows that \\(A\\) is true under every interpretation. Thus\nKreisel’s argument suggests we can make do with models for the\npurpose of characterizing validity in pure quantificational\n logic.[4] \nClassical quantificational logic allows for singular terms other than\nvariables. There are, first, individual constants, and, second,\nsingular terms, which result from the combination of a function symbol\nwith an appropriate number of singular terms. In addition to this,\nclassical quantificational logic with identity makes provision for a\nspecial identity predicate. \nThe vocabulary of the classical theory of quantification and identity\nextends the vocabulary of pure quantificational logic with a set of\nindividual constants with or without subscripts, \\(a, b, c, a_1\\),\n…, and a set of function symbols of various kinds: one-place\nfunction symbols, \\(f^{1}, g^{1}, f^{1}_{1}\\), …, two-place\nfunction symbols, \\(f^{2}, g^{2}, g^{2}_{1}\\),\n etc.[5]\n In addition to this, we may add a special two-place predicate, \\(=\\),\nfor identity. \nBefore we modify the definition of formula for the expanded\nlanguage, we may give a recursive definition of a term of the\nlanguage of the classical theory of quantification and identity. An\nexpression \\(t\\) is a term if, and only if, (i) \\(t\\) is an individual\nvariable, or (ii) \\(t\\) is an individual constant, or (iii) \\(t\\) is\nan expression of the form \\(f^{n}_{i}t_{1}, \\ldots, t_{n}\\), where\n\\(f^{n}_{i}\\) an \\(n\\)-place function symbol and \\(t_1\\), …,\n\\(t_n\\) are themselves terms. Given the definition of term, we can\nreformulate the definition of atomic formula for the expanded\nlanguage to consist of all and only expressions \\(A\\) of the form\n\\(P^n_i t_1, \\ldots, t_n\\), where \\(P^n_i\\) is an \\(n\\)-place\npredicate and \\(t_1\\), …, \\(t_n\\) are each terms or \\(t_i =\nt_j\\) in which \\(t_i\\) and \\(t_j\\) are terms. At this point, we may\nadapt the usual recursive definition of formula for the\nexpanded language. \nThe axioms of classical quantificational logic with identity include\naxioms for quantification and axioms for identity. The axioms for\nquantification include a suitably modified variant of \\((\\forall 1)\\)\nin addition to \\((\\forall 2)\\) and \\((\\forall 3)\\). The minimal\nadjustment in \\((\\forall 1)\\) is meant to accommodate the presence of\nfunction symbols and individual constants. We call a term \\(t\\)\nfree for a variable \\(x\\) if, and only if, no free occurrence\nof \\(x\\) lies within the scope of a quantifier \\(\\forall y\\) or\n\\(\\exists y\\), where \\(y\\) is a variable which occurs in \\(t\\). The\naxiom of universal instantiation, \\((\\forall 1)\\), now reads: \nThe other set of axioms concerns identity. In particular, we will\nsupplement the axioms for quantification with an axiom, (I1), and an\naxiom schema, (I2), designed to govern the identity predicate: \nThe first axiom is sometimes known as Reflexivity, and the second is\nknown as the Indiscernibility of Identicals. When combined, they\nenable one to derive the symmetry and transitivity of identity as\nimmediate\n consequences.[6] \nWe need only make minimal adjustments in the model theory in order to\naccommodate the expanded vocabulary of the classical theory of\nquantification and identity. A model \\(\\langle D, I \\rangle\\) will\nstill consist of a non-empty domain, \\(D\\), and an interpretation\nfunction, \\(I\\). One difference, however, is that we now take \\(I\\),\nin addition, to assign a member of the domain \\(D\\) to each individual\nconstant and to assign an \\(n\\)-place function from the set of ordered\n\\(n\\)-tuples of members of \\(D\\), \\(D^{n}\\), into \\(D\\) to each\nfunction symbol \\(f^{n}_{i}\\). \nWe now define satisfaction in terms of denotation. Given a\nmodel \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) and an assignment \\(s\\) for the model,\nwe say that a term \\(t\\) denotes a member \\(d\\) of the domain\nunder assignment \\(s\\), in symbols \\(Den_{s}(t) = d\\), if, and only\nif, (i) \\(t\\) is a variable \\(x_i\\) and \\(s(x_i) = d\\), or (ii) \\(t\\)\nis an individual constant \\(c\\) and \\(I(c) = d\\), or (iii) \\(t\\) is of\nthe form \\(f^{n}_{i}t_1 , \\ldots, t_n\\) and \\(d =\nI(f^{n}_{i})(Den_{s}(t_1), \\ldots, Den_{s}(t_n))\\). \nThe definition of satisfaction in a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by\nan assignment \\(s\\) proceeds much like before, except for the obvious\nclauses for atomic formulas of the form \\(P^n_i t_1, \\ldots, t_n\\) and\n\\(t_i = t_j\\): \\(P^n_i t_1, \\ldots, t_n\\) is satisfied by \\(s\\) in\n\\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) if and only if \\(\\langle Den_{s}(t_1), \\ldots,\nDen_{s}(t_n) \\rangle \\in I(P^n_i)\\). And \\(t_i = t_j\\) is satisfied by\n\\(s\\) in \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) if and only if the denotation of\n\\(t_i\\) under \\(s\\) is identical to the denotation of \\(t_j\\) under\n\\(s\\). \nThe definitions of truth in a model and validity\ncarry over from pure quantificational logic. \nWe have Soundness and Completeness theorems for classical\nquantificational logic with identity as well as Compactness and\nLöwenheim-Skolem theorems. The entry on\n first-order model theory\n offers an in-depth examination of these and other meta-theoretic\nresults for classical quantificational logic with identity. \nIn what follows, we look at three rival accounts of quantification in\nmodern logic. They are departures from classical quantification logic\nbecause they reject some of classical axioms of quantification or\nbecause they question some aspect of the Tarskian model theory we have\nused to interpret the language of classical quantification logic. \nIn pure quantificational logic, one may, for example, derive the\nconditional \\(\\forall x \\ Px \\rightarrow \\exists x \\ Px\\) as an\nimmediate consequence of the axioms. But the derivability of this\nsentence—and others like \\(\\exists x (Px \\rightarrow\nPx)\\)—may give one pause. To the extent to which logic should\nremain neutral in ontological matters, the axioms of pure\nquantificational logic should not by themselves be able to prove that\nthere is something rather than nothing. From a model-theoretic\nperspective, the exclusion of the empty domain as an eligible domain\nfor a model may likewise seem artificial. Since the validity of\nformulas like \\(\\forall x \\ Px \\rightarrow \\exists x Px\\) or \\(\\exists\nx (Px \\rightarrow Px)\\) is largely a byproduct of what may seem an\nad hoc stipulation, one may be motivated to expand the range\nof model-theoretic interpretations in order to allow for a model with\nan empty domain of discourse. Quine (1954) used the label\n“inclusive” to refer to alternatives to quantificational\nlogic that make allowance for such a model. \nAccording to Quine (1954), an inclusive quantificational logic should\nevaluate every universally quantified formula of the form \\(\\forall x\n\\ A\\) to be vacuously true in a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) in which\n\\(D\\) is empty, and it should evaluate every existentially quantified\nformula of the form \\(\\exists x \\ A\\) to be false in such a model.\n\\(\\forall x \\ Px \\rightarrow \\exists x \\ Px\\) and \\(\\exists x (Px\n\\rightarrow Px)\\) are therefore not valid on the expanded model\ntheory. However, it is quite a delicate matter to provide a\ncompositional amendment of the Tarskian definition of truth in a model\n\\(\\langle D, I \\rangle\\) under an assignment \\(s\\) that delivers\nQuine’s\n verdicts.[7] \nAn axiomatization of inclusive quantificational logic should weaken\nthe axiom of universal instantiation in order to prevent the\nderivation of theorems such as \\((\\forall x \\ Px \\rightarrow \\exists x\n\\ Px)\\) or \\(\\exists x (Px \\rightarrow Px)\\). One option independently\nexplored by Kripke (1963) and Lambert (1963) is to replace (\\(\\forall\n1\\)) with a closed axiom schema: \nIn the absence of identity, by itself, this change results in an\ninadequate axiomatization of pure quantificational logic, one which\ncannot yield every instance of a permutation principle discussed by\nFine (1983): \nThe permutation principle, however, becomes redundant in the presence\nof axioms for identity. \nThe axiomatization of classical quantification logic with identity\nthat emerges from the substitution is discussed by Lambert (1963) with\na different motivation in mind: Lambert wanted to allow for\nalternatives to the classical theory of quantification and identity\nthat remain “free” from any assumptions concerning the\nexistence of denotations for its singular terms and predicates. This\nmotivation has given rise to a variety of alternatives to the\nclassical theory of quantification and identity that are generally\nsubsumed under the label free logic. Some free logics qualify\nas inclusive quantificational logics, but not all do. To the extent to\nwhich the motivations are different, such differences are only to be\nexpected. The entry on\n free logic\n discusses a variety of options for free logic. \nIntuitionistic propositional logic is weaker than classical\npropositional logic. All intuitionistically valid formulas are\nclassically valid, but classically valid formulas like \\((A \\vee \\lnot\nA)\\) and \\((\\lnot \\lnot A \\rightarrow A)\\) are not intuitionistically\n valid.[8]\n The exclusion of these formulas from the range of intuitionistic\ntheorems can be motivated by the usual Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov\ninterpretation of the connectives: \nDespite the differences in interpretation, there is an important\nconnection between intuitionistic and classical propositional logic.\nFor we know that a formula \\(A\\) is a theorem of classical\npropositional logic if, and only if, \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) is a theorem of\nintuitionistic propositional logic. Thus while \\((A \\vee \\neg A)\\) is\nobviously not a theorem of intuitionistic propositional logic, \\(\\neg\n\\neg (A \\vee \\neg A)\\) is in fact intuitionistically provable. This\nfact is at the core of a familiar translation from classical into\nintuitionistic propositional logic due to Kurt Gödel and Gerhard\nGentzen. For a summary of this and related facts, the reader may\nconsult the entry on\n intuitionistic logic. \nNow, intuitionistic quantificational logic may be motivated by the\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of the quantifiers: \nThe intuitionistic interpretation does not sanction the classical\nequivalence between \\(\\exists x \\ A\\) and \\(\\neg \\forall x \\neg \\ A\\).\nIndeed, the two quantifiers must remain part of the primitive\nvocabulary of intuitionistic quantificational logic. \nThe intuitionistic axioms of quantification include counterparts of\nthe classical axioms of universal instantiation and existential\ngeneralization: \nIn addition to this, we require counterparts of the classical\n(\\(\\forall^{I}2\\)) for each quantifier: \nWe have a rule of universal generalization: \nIt is not generally true that a formula \\(A\\) is a theorem of pure\nquantificational logic if, and only if, \\(\\neg \\neg A\\) is a theorem\nof intuitionistic quantificational logic, but there is a more\nsophisticated double-negation interpretation of theorems of pure\nquantificational logic. In particular, we have that a formula \\(A\\) is\na theorem of quantificational logic if, and only if, it is a theorem\nof intuitionistic quantificational logic supplemented with a double\nnegation schema: \nMuch like in the propositional case, this fact may be exploited to\ngive a more sophisticated translation from pure quantificational logic\ninto intuitionistic quantificational logic. Details are given in\nMoschovakis (2010). \nIn intuitionistic quantificational logic, we cannot move from \\(\\neg\n\\forall x \\neg A\\) to \\(\\exists x \\ A\\), but we still have this: \nMoreover, since \\(A\\) intuitionistically entails \\(\\lnot \\lnot A\\), we\ncan infer: \nIn intuitionistic quantificational logic, \\(\\forall x \\lnot \\lnot A\\)\nis strictly weaker than \\(\\lnot \\lnot \\forall x A\\), since we\nhave: \nA variety of interpretations have been advanced for intuitionistic\nquantificational logic, but the model theory developed by Kripke\n(1965) is perhaps the most similar to the model theory of classical\nquantificational logic. A Kripke model \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) is based on a\nframe \\(\\langle S, \\preceq \\rangle\\), which consists of a set of\nstages partially ordered by an accessibility relation\n\\(\\preceq\\). A Kripke model assigns an inhabited domain, \\(D_{s}\\), to\neach stage \\(s \\in S\\), subject to the constraint that \\(D_s \\subseteq\nD_{s'}\\) when \\(s \\preceq s'\\). We may assume that suitable names for\nthe members of each \\(D_s\\) have been adjoined to the language.\nFinally, for \\(n>0\\), a Kripke model assigns a set of \\(n\\)-tuples\nof members of \\(D_s\\) for each \\(n\\)-place predicate \\(P^{n}\\) at each\nstage \\(s\\) in \\(S\\), subject to the constraint that if \\(s \\preceq\ns'\\) and \\(P^n\\) is true of \\(\\langle d_1, \\ldots, d_n \\rangle\\) at\n\\(s\\), then \\(P^{n}\\) is still true of \\(\\langle d_1, \\ldots, d_n\n\\rangle\\) at \\(s'\\). \nThe entry on\n intuitionistic logic\n provides a more formal and complete statement of Kripke’s model\ntheory for intuitionistic quantificational logic and states Soundness\nand Completeness Theorems for it. Very roughly, a negation \\(\\neg A\\)\nis true at a stage \\(s\\) if, and only if, \\(A\\) is not true at any\nstage \\(s'\\) such that \\(s \\preceq s'\\); an existentially quantified\nformula \\(\\exists x \\ A\\) is true at a stage \\(s\\) if, and only if,\n\\(A\\) is true of some \\(d\\) in \\(D_s\\) at \\(s\\); and a formula\n\\(\\forall x \\ A\\) is true at a stage \\(s\\) if, and only if, \\(A\\) is\ntrue of every \\(d\\) in \\(D_{s'}\\) for every \\(s'\\) such that \\(s\n\\preceq s'\\). \nFor a taste of what Kripke models can do, consider: \n\\(\\neg \\forall x \\neg \\ A \\rightarrow \\exists x \\ A\\) \n\\(\\lnot \\lnot \\forall x \\ A \\rightarrow \\forall x \\ A\\) \n\\(\\forall x \\lnot \\lnot A \\rightarrow \\lnot \\lnot \\forall x \\\nA\\) \nLet \\(\\mathcal{K}\\) be a Kripke model based on a frame in which we\nhave two stages \\(s_0 \\preceq s_1\\). Assume \\(\\{d \\}\\) is the domain\nassociated to each stage by the model, and let a monadic predicate\n\\(P\\) be true of \\(d\\) at \\(s_1\\) but not at \\(s_0\\). We may verify\nthat \\(\\neg \\forall x \\neg Px\\) is true at \\(s_0\\), even though\n\\(\\exists x \\ Px\\) is not true at \\(s_0\\). So, (i) is not\nintuitionistically valid. One may likewise verify that \\(\\lnot \\lnot\n\\forall x Px\\) is true at \\(s_0\\), even though \\(\\forall x Px\\) is not\ntrue at \\(s_0\\). It follows that (ii) is not intuitionistically valid\neither. \nFor (iii), consider, for example, a Kripke model based on a frame in\nwhich we have an infinite number of stages \\(s_0 \\preceq s_1 \\preceq\n\\ldots \\preceq s_n \\preceq \\ldots\\). We may assume that \\(D_{s_{n}} =\n\\{ d_0 , \\ldots, d_n \\}\\) and that a monadic predicate \\(P\\) is true\nat \\(s_n\\) of every \\(d_m\\) in the domain except for \\(d_n\\). It turns\nout that \\(\\forall x \\lnot \\lnot Px\\) is true at \\(s_0\\) even though\n\\(\\lnot \\lnot \\forall x Px\\) is not true at \\(s_0\\). Therefore,\n\\(\\forall x \\lnot \\lnot A \\rightarrow \\lnot \\lnot \\forall x A\\) is not\nintuitionistically valid either. These and similar examples are\ndiscussed in Burgess 2009. \nThe model-theoretic interpretation of the language of quantificational\nlogic relied on the Tarskian definition of satisfaction in a model by\nan assignment of values to the variables. But the assignment of an\nobject to a variable is never dependent on the availability of a term,\n\\(t\\), for the object in the language for which one defines truth in a\nmodel. Indeed, an existentially quantified formula \\(\\exists x \\ A\\)\nmay well be true in a model even if no atomic formula of the form\n\\(A(t/y)\\) is true in the model. \nSubstitutional quantifiers \\(\\Pi \\alpha \\ A\\) and \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\\nA\\) are interpreted differently. An interpretation associates with\nthem not a domain of quantification, but rather a substitution class,\n\\(C\\), of linguistic expressions of an appropriate syntactic category\nin the initial language. The truth conditions for substitutionally\nquantified sentences of the form \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\ A\\) and \\(\\Pi\n\\alpha \\ A\\) may be given in terms of the truth conditions of suitable\nsubstitution instances of \\(A(\\epsilon / \\alpha)\\) in which each\noccurrence of the substitutional variable \\(\\alpha\\) has been replaced\nwith a linguistic expression, \\(\\epsilon\\), of the appropriate\nsyntactic category in the substitution class for the quantifier: \nThis characterization of substitutional quantification allows for\nsubstitutional variables of different syntactic categories, whether\nsingular terms, predicates or sentences. Indeed, substitutional\nquantification is often used to mimic quantification into predicate\nand sentence position of the kinds discussed later in this entry. \nEarly work on substitutional quantification was developed in Marcus\n(1961) but it soon became the subject of debate in the next two\ndecades as philosophers made use of substitutional quantification in\nontology and the philosophy of language and mathematics. Belnap and\nDunn (1968), Parsons (1971), and Kripke (1976) are some of the\nrelevant papers in the debate. For a sense of some of the purported\napplications of substitutional quantification, the reader may consult\nthe essays collected in Gottlieb 1981. For additional discussion, see\nHand (2007). \nLet us momentarily focus on singular terms. To keep matters simple,\nconsider an impoverished fragment of the language of arithmetic with\none constant, \\(0\\), read: “zero” and one functional\nsymbol, \\(S\\), read: “the successor of”. The domain of the\nintended interpretation consists of a set of natural numbers, which\nare named by singular terms of the form \\(0\\), \\(SS0\\), \\(SSS0\\),\n…, etc. If we now associate the class of all such terms to the\nsubstitutional quantifiers \\(\\Sigma \\alpha\\) and \\(\\Pi \\alpha\\), then\na sentence like \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\ \\alpha = \\alpha\\) is evaluated as\ntrue in virtue of the truth of formulas like \\(0 = 0\\), whereas \\(\\Pi\n\\alpha \\ \\alpha < \\alpha\\) is evaluated as false in virtue of\nfalsity of formulas like \\(0 < 0\\). In general, a sentence of the\nform \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\ A\\) exhibits the same truth conditions as an\ninfinitary disjunction of the \n\nform: \\[A(0/\\alpha) \\vee A(S0/\\alpha) \\vee \\ldots\\vee A(SS\n\\overbrace{\\ldots}^n S0/\\alpha) \\vee \\ldots\\] whereas a sentence of\n\n the form \\(\\Pi \\alpha \\ A\\)\nexhibits the same truth conditions as an \n\ninfinitary conjunction: \\[A(0/\\alpha) \\wedge A(S0/\\alpha) \\wedge\n\\ldots\\wedge A(SS \\overbrace{\\ldots}^n S0/\\alpha) \\wedge \\ldots\\] The\n\n case of\narithmetic is optimal because we have a name for each member of the\nintended domain. This means that in general, a quantified sentence of\nthe form \\(\\exists x \\ A\\) will be true if, and only if its\nsubstitutional counterpart \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\ A\\) is likewise true. But\nin this respect, however, the language of arithmetic is the exception\nand not the rule. In real analysis, for example, there are too many\nobjects in the domain to have a name in a countable language. In such\na situation, we must confront the risk that a sentence of the form\n\\(\\exists x \\ A\\) may be true even if \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\ A\\) remains\nfalse in virtue of the lack of a true substitution instance of the\nform \\(A(t/ \\alpha)\\). This may happen, for example, if the objects\nthat satisfy the open formula \\(A\\) are not denoted by any singular\nterm in the language. \nCall the initial language “the object language”. And call\nthe language in which we explain the truth conditions of sentences of\nthe initial language “the metalanguage”. In the\nmetalanguage, we have explained the truth condition for \\(\\Sigma\n\\alpha \\ A\\) in terms of what looks like objectual quantification over\nlinguistic expressions. To acknowledge this is of course not to claim\nthat the intended interpretation of substitutional quantification is\none on which it is merely objectual quantification over linguistic\nexpressions. But just what the intended interpretation of the\nsubstitutional quantifier might be has been the subject of intense\ncontroversy. Indeed, van Inwagen (1981) and Fine (1989), for example,\nhave each argued that there is no separate intended interpretation we\ncan understand independently from our grasp of objectual\nquantification over linguistic expressions of the relevant sort. \nWhatever the philosophical import of substitutional quantification,\nKripke (1976) makes plain that there is no technical obstacle to\nintroducing substitutional quantifiers into a given language. In what\nis perhaps the canonical treatment of substitutional quantification,\nhe explained how to extend an interpreted language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\ninto a substitutional language \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) equipped with\nsubstitutional quantification over a class of expressions in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\). One first expands the vocabulary of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)\nwith an infinite stock of variables \\(\\alpha_1\\), \\(\\alpha_2\\),\n… and a substitutional quantifier \\(\\Sigma\\). (Kripke defines\n\\(\\Pi\\) as the dual of \\(\\Sigma\\), where \\(\\Pi \\alpha \\ A\\)\nabbreviates: \\(\\lnot \\Sigma \\alpha \\lnot \\ A\\).) \nAn atomic preformula is an expression that results from a\nsentence of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) when zero or more terms are replaced by a\nsubstitutional variable. A form is an atomic preformula,\nwhere the replacement of its substitutional variables with terms\nyields back a sentence. We can now define a formula of\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) recursively. \\(A\\) is a formula of\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) if and only if either (i) \\(A\\) is a\nform of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) or (ii) \\(A\\) is \\(\\lnot\nB\\), where \\(B\\) is a formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) or (iii)\n\\(A\\) is \\((B \\rightarrow C)\\), where \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) are each\nformulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) or (iv) \\(A\\) is \\(\\Sigma \\alpha\n\\ B\\), where \\(B\\) is a formula of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\). A\nsentence of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) is a formula without free\nsubstitutional variables. \nKripke defines truth for sentences of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\)\nrecursively in terms of truth in \\(\\mathcal{L}\\). If \\(A\\) is an\natomic sentence of \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\)—which may well be a\ncomplex sentence of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), then \\(A\\) is true in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) if, and only if, \\(A\\) is true in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}\\). If \\(A\\) is a sentence of the form \\(\\lnot B\\), then\n\\(A\\) is true in \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) if, and only if, \\(B\\) is\nnot true in \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\). If \\(A\\) is of the form \\((B\n\\rightarrow C)\\), then \\(A\\) is true in \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) if,\nand only if, \\(B\\) is not true or \\(C\\) is true in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\). Finally, and more crucially, if \\(A\\) is of\nthe form \\(\\Sigma \\alpha \\ B\\), then \\(A\\) is true in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) if and only if \\(B(\\epsilon/\\alpha)\\) is true\nin \\(\\mathcal{L}^{\\Sigma}\\) for some \\(\\epsilon\\) in the substitution\nclass \\(C\\) associated with \\(\\Sigma\\). \nKripke then defines a sentence \\(A\\) of the language of pure\nsubstitutional quantificational logic to be valid if, and only if\n\\(A\\) comes out true no matter what base language \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and\nnon-empty class of terms \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) we take as input for the\nsubstitutional expansion and what predicates of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) we\nsubstitute for the predicates of \\(A\\). In particular, Kripke notes\nthat when the quantifiers of a valid sentence of pure quantificational\nlogic are suitably rewritten as substitutional quantifiers, we obtain\na valid sentence in the language of pure substitutional\nquantificational logic. \nEach departure from classical quantificational logic we have\nconsidered originated from an objection to either axioms of pure\nquantificational logic or the Tarskian definition of satisfaction in a\nmodel by an assignment of objects to the variables of the language. We\nnow take both for granted and look at proposed extensions of classical\nquantificational logic with new styles of quantification. Each\nextension will generally require us to add new axioms for the new\nstyles of quantification and to expand the Tarskian definition of\ntruth in a model in terms of satisfaction. \nFrege originally conceived of the quantifier \\(\\forall\\) as a monadic\npredicate that is true of a first-level concept \\(F\\) under which only\nobjects fall if, and only if, all objects fall under \\(F\\); likewise,\nFrege assimilated \\(\\exists\\) to a monadic predicate that is true of a\nfirst-level concept if, and only if, at least one object falls under\n\\(F\\). In modern terms, we may say that the truth conditions of\n\\(\\forall x \\ A\\) are given in terms of a certain condition on the\nextension of the formula \\(A\\). Given a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\)\nand a formula \\(A(x)\\) with a single free variable \\(x\\), it will be\nconvenient to use \\(A(x)[d]\\) to abbreviate: \\(A\\) is satisfied in\n\\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) by variable assignments on which \\(d\\) is the\nvalue assigned to the variable \\(x\\). The extension of a formula\n\\(A(x)\\) with a single free variable \\(x\\) in a model \\(\\langle D,\nI\\rangle\\) is just \\(\\{ d \\in D: A(x)[d] \\}\\), which we may abbreviate\n\\(I(A)\\). \nThe contemporary study of generalized quantifiers begins with\nMostowski (1957) and Lindström (1966) (the entry on\n generalized quantifiers\n provides a survey of recent developments and applications in logic\nand natural language). Lindström and Mowstoski began with a\ngeneralization of Frege’s conception of a quantifier in at least\ntwo dimensions. First, they considered additional unary quantifiers\n\\(Q(A)\\), which behave syntactically like \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\)\nbut set a different condition on the extension of \\(A\\). Second, they\nconsidered binary quantifiers \\(Q(A, B)\\), which set a given condition\nbased on a relation between the extensions of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). \nCardinality quantifiers provide a simple example of the first sort of\ngeneralization. If we write \\(card(S)\\) to denote the cardinality of a\ngiven set \\(S\\), we may introduce unary quantifiers of the form\n\\(Q(A)\\), which set a cardinality condition on the extension of a\nformula \\(A\\): \n\\(\\exists_{\\geq n}\\) is read: “at least \\(n\\) objects” and\n\\(\\exists !_{n}\\) is read: “exactly \\(n\\) objects.” Both\nquantifiers are definable in terms of a standard quantifier against\nthe background of classical quantificational logic. \nOther cardinality quantifiers, however, do increase the expressive\npower of classical quantifical logic. We may, for example, introduce\ncardinality quantifiers of the form \\(Q(A)\\), which require the\nextension of \\(A\\) to have an infinite cardinality: \n\\(\\aleph_0\\) is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, and\n\\(\\aleph_1\\) is the next transfinite\n cardinal.[9]\n When we supplement classical quantificational logic with \\(Q_0\\),\nread: “at least \\(\\aleph_0\\) objects”, we must relinquish\nCompactness even if we can still retain the Löwenheim-Skolem\ntheorem. The opposite is the case, however, when we supplement\nclassical quantificational logic with \\(Q_1\\), read: “at least\n\\(\\aleph_1\\) objects” instead. \nTwo more cardinality quantifiers that have been studied in the\nliterature are the Chang quantifier and the Rescher quantifier: \nThe Chang quantifier collapses into \\(\\forall\\) only in the finite\ncase; if \\(D\\) is infinite, then the extension of a formula \\(A\\),\n\\(I(A)\\), may match the cardinality of the domain, \\(D\\), even if the\ntwo sets are different, i.e., \\(I(A) \\neq D\\). \nThe second dimension of generalization concerns the number of\narguments we let quantifiers take. We can, for example, introduce\nbinary quantifiers, \\(Q(A, B)\\), whose truth condition is given in\nterms of a binary relation between the extension of the formula \\(A\\)\nand the extension of the formula \\(B\\) in a model. \nAs defined above, \\(Most(A, B)\\), for example, is true if and only if\nmore objects are both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) than there are objects that are\n\\(A\\) and not \\(B\\). \nOf special interest in the philosophy of language is the case of\nRussellian definite descriptions, which can be subsumed under the\ncategory of a binary quantifier: \nFor a systematic discussion of these issues, the reader may consult\nPeters & Westerståhl (2006). \nWe generally let quantifiers bind a single type of variable, but we\nmay find it helpful, on occasion, to let them bind additional types of\nvariables in order to quantify over different sorts of values. In\narithmetic, for example, we may want to be able to quantify over\nnatural numbers and sets thereof and we may find it convenient to\nclassify the individual variables of the language into at least two\ncategories. We may reserve lowercase variables \\(x, y, z, x_1\\),\n… to range over natural numbers, and we may use uppercase\nvariables \\(X, Y, Z, X_1\\), … to range over sets of natural\nnumbers. In a many-sorted language with functional symbols and\nindividual constants, each singular term would be assigned a single\nsort. If we want identity, we need to include an identity predicate\nfor each sort of a variable and insist on each such predicate to be\nflanked only by singular terms of the appropriate sort. Other\npredicates may nevertheless take arguments of different sorts; for\nexample, in a two-sorted language in which lowercase variables range\nover numbers and uppercase variables range over sets of numbers, \\(x\n\\epsilon X\\), for example, can take as arguments variables of\ndifferent sorts and may be read “\\(x\\) is in \\(X\\)”. \nTo accommodate the new styles of variables in the model theory for\nmany-sorted logic, we may add a domain for each style of variable. A\nmodel for a two-sorted language, for example, may consist of an\nordered triple \\(\\langle D_1, D_2, I\\rangle\\) in which \\(D_1\\) and\n\\(D_2\\) specify the domain of quantification associated to each style\nof variable, and \\(I\\) is an interpretation function, which assigns\nappropriate values and extensions to each expression in the\nnon-logical vocabulary. (Since each singular term is assigned a sort,\n\\(I\\) must be constrained to make sure singular terms of each sort\ndenote objects in the appropriate domain.) The metatheory for\nmany-sorted logic is closely related to the metatheory for classical\nquantificational logic. One may, for example, prove many-sorted\nversions of Compactness and the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Details\nmay be found in Enderton 2001. \nHowever, the move to a many-sorted language is largely a matter of\nconvenience. Many-sorted quantification may be analyzed in terms of\nrestricted one-sorted quantification. For each many-sorted language\nwith \\(n\\) styles of variable, we may introduce a one-sorted language,\nwhich comes with a one-place predicate, \\(S_i\\), for each sort in the\nmany-sorted language. We may set out to translate each formula of the\nmany-sorted language into a formula of the one-sorted language: we\ntranslate each identity in terms of a single identity predicate; a\nquantification on a variable of sort \\(i\\), \\(\\forall x^i \\ A\\), is\nreplaced with a formula of the form \\(\\forall x (S_i x \\rightarrow\nA)\\). We may, in addition, turn each model for the many-sorted\nlanguage \\(\\langle D_1, \\ldots, D_n, I \\rangle\\) into a model for the\nresulting one-sorted language \\(\\langle \\bigcup_{n} D_n, I^\\ast\n\\rangle\\) in which we take the domain to consist in the union of the\ndomains associated to each original sort. The interpretation function,\n\\(I^\\ast\\) will coincide with \\(I\\) when it comes to predicates and\nindividual constants. However, \\(I^\\ast\\) will generally have to\nextend the interpretation of a functional symbol, \\(f^n_i\\), by \\(I\\),\nin one way or another. Finally, \\(I^\\ast\\) will interpret the identity\npredicate as usual. \nStill, even if there is no real gain in expressive power, one reason\nto flag the availability of many-sorted quantification is because some\nof the extensions of classical quantificational logic to be examined\nbelow are closely related to certain theories couched in the language\nof two-sorted logic. In particular, second-order logic and the theory\nof plural quantification will be each closely related to two\nfirst-order two-sorted theories, which lack the expressive resources\noften attributed to each extension of classical quantificational\nlogic. \nSecond-order logic is an extension of classical quantificational logic\nin which we allow for quantification into predicate position.\nSecond-order logic originated with Frege (1879), which developed a\nformal language equipped with predicate variables of the form\n\\(X^{n}_{i}\\). Predicate variables behave syntactically like\n\\(n\\)-place predicates of the form \\(P^{n}_{i}\\). In second-order\nlogic, we allow a predicate variable \\(X^{n}_{i}\\) followed by \\(n\\)\nvariables \\(X^{n}x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\) to count as an atomic formula.\nLikewise, we allow the quantifiers \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\) to bind\npredicate and individual variables as in \\(\\forall X^{n} \\ A\\) and\n\\(\\exists X^{n} \\ A\\). \nThe axioms for second-order logic supplement the axioms of classical\nquantificational logic with distinctive axioms for the second-order\nquantifiers. Call a predicate variable \\(Y^n\\) free for\n\\(X^n\\) in \\(A\\) if, and only if, no free occurrences of \\(X^n\\) lie\nwithin the scope of a quantification on \\(Y^n\\), \\(\\forall Y^n\\) or\n\\(\\exists Y^n\\): \n(\\(\\forall^2 1\\)) is a second-order version of universal\ninstantiation. The second-order version of universal\ngeneralization becomes: \nObserve that while \\(\\forall X \\ Xx \\rightarrow P x\\) is an instance\nof (\\(\\forall^2 1\\)), the formula \\(\\forall X \\ Xx \\rightarrow (P x\n\\wedge Q x)\\) is not an instance of the axiom. But whatever one takes\nthe value of a second-order variable to be, you may think that there\nshould be one under which an object falls if and only if it satisfies\nthe condition stated by the formula \\((P x \\wedge Q x)\\). To make\nsure, we may rely on an axiom of second-order\ncomprehension: \nA formula like \\(\\forall X \\ Xx \\rightarrow (P x \\wedge Q x)\\) now\nfollows from the combination of second-order universal instantiation\nand an instance of second-order comprehension: \\(\\exists X \\forall\nx(Xx \\leftrightarrow (P x \\wedge Q\n x))\\).[10] \nTo develop a model theory for a second-order language, we may still\ntake a model \\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) to consist of a non-empty domain\nand an interpretation function. We now let an assignment \\(s\\) for\n\\(\\langle D, I\\rangle\\) to be a function that assigns a member of\n\\(D\\) to each individual variable and a set of \\(n\\)-tuples of members\nof \\(D\\) to each predicate variable \\(X^n\\). We then modify the\ndefinition of satisfaction to let a formula of the form \\(\\forall X^n\n\\ B\\) be satisfied in \\(\\langle D, I \\rangle\\) by an assignment \\(s\\)\nif, and only if, \\(B\\) is satisfied by all assignments of the form\n\\(s[X^n/R^n]\\), where \\(R^n\\) is a set of \\(n\\)-tuples of members of\n\\(D_1\\). The definitions of truth in a model and validity proceed\nexactly as in the first-order case. \nThe entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic\n provides more detail and gives some indication of the complexity of\nthe set of valid second-order formulas in the standard model theory\nfor second-order logic. No Completeness, Compactness, or\nLöwenheim-Skolem theorem is available for second-order logic with\nstandard models. The entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic\n provides concrete illustrations of these facts. \nA Henkin model lets a second-order variable \\(X^n\\) range over some\nsubset of the set of \\(n\\)-tuples of members of the domain \\(D\\). Thus\na Henkin model consists of a domain \\(D\\) of individuals, a domain\n\\(D^n_2\\) of sets of \\(n\\)-tuples of objects in \\(D\\) for each \\(n\n\\leq 1\\), and an interpretation function \\(I\\). To make sure that\nevery instance of second-order comprehension is validated in the\nmodel, we require each \\(D^n_2\\) to contain every set of \\(n\\)-tuples\nof members of \\(D\\) that is definable by a formula \\(A\\) of the\nlanguage. \nThis is what the entry on\n second-order and higher-order logic\n calls general semantics. The metatheory of second-order logic with\nHenkin models is very much like the metatheory of classical\nquantificational logic in that it is complete, compact, and subject to\na Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. One reason for this is that\nsecond-order logic under the Henkin model theory is only a notational\nvariant of a two-sorted first-order theory in which the axioms of\nquantificational logic are supplemented by suitable axioms of\ncomprehension. \nWhich model theory is more appropriate for second-order logic? There\nis a trade-off between the attractive features of the metatheory of\nsecond-order logic with Henkin models, on the one hand, and the\nexpressive power of second-order logic with standard models, on the\nother. Frege’s own interest in second-order quantification had\nmuch to do with its ability to express the concept of the\nancestral of a dyadic relation \\(R\\), which allowed him in\nturn to define the concept natural number in terms of \\(0\\)\nand successor. For details, the reader may consult the entry\non\n Frege’s Theorem and Foundations of Arithmetic.\n There are, in addition, categorical axiomatizations of\narithmetic, where a set of sentences is categorical if, and\nonly if, all of its models are isomorphic, which means that there is\nonly one model up to isomorphism. Dedekind (1893) famously proved, for\nexample, that the second-order formulation of the Peano Axioms\ncharacterized the structure of the natural number system. There is a\nsimilar result for real analysis. For second-order set theory, Zermelo\n(1930) observed that given two models of second-order Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory, one is isomorphic to a strongly inaccessible initial\nsegment of the other. The entry on\n set theory\n describes the axioms of set theory. Other examples of the expressive\nresources afforded by second-order quantification with standard models\nare discussed in Shapiro (1991). The adoption of a model theory based\non Henkin models requires one to surrender all these applications. \nMuch like in the case of pure quantificational logic, no\nmodel—standard or otherwise—for the language of\nsecond-order logic interprets the quantifiers to range over a\nuniversal domain of discourse. But if there are interpretations of the\nlanguage of second-order logic to which no model corresponds, the\nquestion arises again of whether truth in all models is tantamount to\ntruth under all interpretations of the language. Unfortunately, in the\nabsence of a Completeness theorem, Kreisel’s argument is not\navailable for second-order logic with standard models. \nOne may nevertheless argue that a formula is true in all models only\nif it is true under all interpretations of the language by appeal to a\nsecond-order principle of reflection. This reflection principle makes\nsure that a formula \\(A\\) of the language of second-order set theory\nis true when the quantifiers are taken to range unrestrictedly over\nthe universal domain if, and only if, \\(A\\) is true when the\nquantifiers are restricted to some set-sized initial segment of the\nuniverse of a certain\n sort.[11]\n Shapiro (1987) discusses both the set-theoretic principle and its\nrole in the justification of the claim that if a sentence is true in\nevery standard model, then it is true under every interpretation of\nthe language. Unfortunately, second-order reflection takes us beyond\nthe scope of second-order Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and the axiom of\nchoice (ZFC). \nTo make sense of interpretations over a universal domain, one may\nconceive of an interpretation as a value of a second-order predicate\nvariable, \\(I\\), which applies to ordered pairs of a certain sort. An\ninterpretation, \\(I\\), applies to ordered pairs of the form \\(\\langle\n\\forall, o \\rangle\\), when \\(o\\) is in the domain of the\ninterpretation, and \\(I\\) applies to ordered pairs of the form\n\\(\\langle P^{n}_{i}, \\langle a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\rangle \\rangle\\), when\n\\(P^{n}_{i}\\) is taken to apply to the objects in \\(\\langle a_1,\n\\ldots, a_n\\rangle\\). The usual definition of an assignment is then\nreplaced by one on which an assignment is given by the value of a\nsecond-order variable \\(S\\), which applies to an ordered pair of the\nform \\(\\langle x, o\\rangle\\), where \\(o\\) is an object, for each\nfirst-order variable in the language, and to ordered pairs of the form\n\\(\\langle X, o\\rangle\\), where \\(o\\) is an object, for each\nsecond-order variable in the language. An assignment \\(S\\) is required\nto pair each first-order variable with exactly one object, but it is\nallowed to pair a second-order variable with any objects whatever. In\nthe presence of these definitions, we can generalize Tarski’s\ndefinition satisfaction in an interpretation by an assignment, truth,\nand\n validity.[12] \nThe status of second-order quantification remains a highly\ncontroversial issue. In the standard model theory for second-order\nquantification, we explain the truth conditions of a formula of the\nform \\(\\forall X \\ A\\) in terms of ordinary quantification over sets.\nAnd this may incline one to follow Quine (1986) in claiming that\nsecond-order quantification is only intelligible as first-order\nquantification over sets of the domain of individuals. Second-order\nlogic would, on this view, be best conceived as a species of\ntwo-sorted first-order set theory. But the mere fact that in the\nstandard semantics for second-order logic, we state the truth\nconditions for second-order quantification in terms of first-order\nquantification over sets is not to admit that this is the\nonly, much less the intended interpretation of\nsecond-order quantification. Frege certainly had a very different\ninterpretation in mind. For a defense of the claim that second-order\nquantification should be taken at face value, the reader may consult\nWilliamson (2003). \nSimilar remarks apply to the logic of a plural quantifier like\n“some objects”. Indeed, much of the recent interest in\nplural quantification in logic and philosophy began with Boolos\n(1984), who provided a plural interpretation of monadic second-order\nquantification. Boolos wanted to defend second-order axiomatizations\nof set theory against the charge that second-order quantification\ncannot be coherently deployed over the domain of all sets. Boolos\n(1984) explained how to interpret the second-order quantifier,\n\\(\\forall X\\), over the domain of all sets in terms of the plural\nquantifier “some sets”, and how to interpret atomic\nformulas of the form \\(Xx\\) in terms of the plural locution “is\none of”. The fact that plural locutions are systematically used\nand perfectly understood in natural language, Boolos thought, helped\naddress the charge of incoherence. The Boolos translation is described\nin detail in the entry on\n plural quantification. \nWhatever the merits of the Boolos translation, plural quantification\nis nowadays generally distinguished from second-order quantification\non the grounds that they bind expressions of different syntactic and\nsemantic categories—while predicates are unsaturated in\nFrege’s terminology and contain argument places to be completed\nby expressions of an appropriate syntactic category, plural terms are\noften thought to be akin to saturated singular terms.\nDifferent variations on this theme may be found, for example, in\nHigginbotham 1998; Oliver & Smiley 2001; Rayo & Yablo 2001;\nWilliamson 2003, 2013. This is a book, which includes an extensive\ndiscussion of important differences in the behavior of plural and\nsecond-order quantification in modal contexts. Plural quantification\nhas consequently become the subject of its own study. \nThe language of plural quantification is carefully described in the\nentry on\n plural quantification.\n Syntactically, it is closely related to a two-sorted first-order\nlanguage in which we have an infinite number of variables \\(xx\\),\n\\(yy\\), \\(zz\\), \\(xx_{1}\\), …. , and a two-place predicate\n\\(\\prec\\), read “one of,” which will be flanked by\nsingular and plural terms, respectively. Identity predicate can only\nflanked by singular terms. \nThe axioms for plural quantification extend the axioms of\nquantificational logic with plural counterparts of (\\(\\forall 1\\)),\n(\\(\\forall 2\\)), and (\\(\\forall 3\\)). Like in the second-order case,\nthe axioms of quantification are supplemented with an axiom schema of\nplural comprehension: \nOne important difference with respect to monadic second-order logic is\nthat instances of plural comprehension are conditionals that state\nthat if something satisfies a certain condition, then some objects are\nall and only objects satisfying the condition. The antecedent of each\nconditional is motivated by an interpretation of the plural quantifier\n\\(\\exists xx\\) to mean “one or more objects”. Indeed,\nLinnebo (2013) explicitly supplements the theory of plural\nquantification with an axiom that states that no matter what some\nobjects may be, there is at least one of them: \nLike in the case of second-order logic, we may provide at least two\nsorts of models for the theory of plural quantification. In both\ncases, we interpret plural quantification in terms of quantification\nover non-empty sets of individuals in the domain \\(D\\). The difference\nis that in standard models we let plural variables range over the full\npower set of \\(D\\), whereas plural variables range over a set \\(S\\) of\nnon-empty subsets of \\(D\\), provided only that \\(S\\) contains all sets\ndefinable by some formula. \nBoth approaches take place in a singular metalanguage. Since the\nmodels are based on set theory, they require the domain of individuals\nto form a set. Furthermore, the definition of satisfaction explains\nwhat is for a formula \\(\\forall xx \\ A\\) to be satisfied in a model by\nan assignment in terms of singular quantification over\nnon-empty subsets of the domain of individuals. This may perhaps\nencourage the impression that plural quantification is only\nintelligible as singular quantification over non-empty sets of\nindividuals. Note, however, that neither the use of set-based models\nnor the use of singular quantification in the definition of\nsatisfaction for a formula of the form \\(\\forall xx\\) is compulsory.\nIn a plural metatheory in which we have a theory of ordered pairs, one\nmay adapt the generalized conception of an interpretation developed in\nRayo & Uzquiano (1999) to provide a plural model theory in which\none uses neither. This model theory is developed, for example, in\nBurgess 2004. \nThe status of plural quantification remains the subject of intense\ncontroversy. All parties agree that plural locutions are\nsystematically used in natural languages, but there is no consensus as\nto whether or not the truth conditions for plurally quantified\nsentences should ultimately involve covert reference to complex\nobjects of some kind or another. The entry on\n plural quantification\n discusses some reasons generally offered in favor of the\nirreducibility of plural quantification to singular quantification\nover sets. But an influential argument against the identification of\nplural quantification and singular quantification over sets traces\nback to Boolos 1984, which claims that the following two sentences\ndiffer in truth value when we let the domain of quantification include\nall sets there are: \nThere is a set of all, and only, non-self-membered sets. \nSome sets are all, and only, non-self-membered sets.  \nWe know from Russell’s paradox that there is no set of all, and\nonly, non-self-membered sets, which makes the first sentence\n false.[13]\n But this is not to deny of course that some sets are all and only\nnon-self-membered sets, even if they fail to compose a set.\nUnfortunately, the argument depends on a certain interpretation of\nRussell’s paradox that is itself controversial and will fail to\nconvince philosophers who think that the moral of Russell’s\nparadox is that no singular quantifier can range unrestrictedly over\nall the sets there are. We will revisit this issue later. \nIt is not uncommon to let the vocabulary of classical quantificational\nlogic include 0-place predicates, which are treated as propositional\nletters. This approach makes propositional logic a proper fragment of\nclassical quantificational logic allowing one to subsume propositional\nquantification as a species of second-order quantification, i.e.,\nquantification into the position of a 0-place predicate. \nOr we may supplement the language of propositional logic with a\npropositional quantifier, \\(\\forall\\), which is allowed to bind\npropositional letters such as \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), …. This is,\nfor example, the course of action taken by Prior (1971), who outlines\na system of propositional quantification. Prior insisted that\npropositional quantification should not be confused with either\nobjectual quantification over propositions or substitutional\nquantification over sentences. Rather, propositional quantification is\na species of non-nominal quantification, since it is quantification\ninto sentence position. \nThe vocabulary of quantified propositional logic contains\npropositional letters \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(r\\), \\(p_1\\), … and\npropositional connectives \\(\\neg, \\rightarrow, \\wedge, \\vee,\n\\leftrightarrow\\). We may as usual treat \\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\rightarrow\\)\nas primitive and take the others as defined. The usual recursive\ndefinition of a formula for propositional logic is appropriately\nsupplemented with a clause that states that \\(\\forall p \\ A\\) is a\nformula whenever \\(A\\) is a formula. \nThe axioms for propositional quantification are direct counterparts of\n\\((\\forall 1)-(\\forall 3)\\). Call a sentence \\(B\\) free for a\npropositional variable \\(p\\) in \\(A\\) if, and only if, no free\noccurrences of \\(p\\) lies within the scope of a quantification on\n\\(q\\), \\(\\forall q\\) or \\(\\exists q\\), where \\(q\\) is a propositional\nvariable which occurs in \\(B\\). Now: \nFor a taste of what they can do, notice that they yield a succinct\njustification of a rule of Uniform Substitution, whereby a formula of\nthe form \\(A(B/p)\\) is a theorem whenever \\(A\\) is a theorem, provided\nthat \\(B\\) is free for \\(p\\) in \\(A\\). So, for example, if\n\\(p\\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)\\) is a theorem, then \\(\\neg r\n\\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow \\neg r)\\) is likewise a theorem, since this\nlast formula is just \\(p\\rightarrow (q \\rightarrow p)(\\neg\n r/p)\\).[14] \nThe axioms are now able to deliver every instance of the following\ncomprehension schema: \nThis is one important difference with respect to second-order\nquantification generally, since we could not automatically derive\nevery instance of second-order comprehension from the other\nquantificational axioms. \nPropositional quantification has been used in order to present a\ndeflationary theory of truth. Grover, Camp, & Belnap (1975) and\nGrover (1992) have, for example, proposed to make use of propositional\nquantification in order to provide a variation on Ramsey’s\nredundancy theory of truth. The main claim they make is that we can\nconceive of phrases like “that is true” or “it is\ntrue” as protosentences, which are supposed to stand to\nsentences as pronouns stand to nouns; unlike pronouns like\n“it”, protosentences occupy sentence position, but just\nlike pronouns may be used for purposes of cross-reference to earlier\nnouns, protosentences may be used for purposes of cross-reference to\nsentences uttered earlier in a conversation. Thus phrases like\n“that is true” or “it is true” are akin to\npropositional variables, which may be bound by propositional\nquantifiers. \nPrior (1961) makes use of propositional quantification in order to\nprovide an intensional version of the Liar Paradox. In particular, if\n\\(T\\) is a sentential operator of the appropriate sort, then the\nfollowing is a consequence of the axioms for propositional\nquantification: \nIf we take \\(T\\) as Prior did, to stand for the sentential operator\n“It is said by a Cretan that”, then we may read the\ntheorem as the claim that if it is said by a Cretan that whatever is\nsaid by a Cretan is not the case, then there are at least two things\nsaid by a Cretan. So, quite surprisingly, it is inconsistent to assume\nthat the only thing said by a Cretan is that whatever is said by a\nCretan is not the case. \nKaplan (1995) makes use of a different observation to raise a problem\nfor the standard model theory for quantified propositional modal\nlogic. He observed, in particular, that if \\(Q\\) is a sentential\noperator of the appropriate sort, then the following sentence is not\nsatisfiable in any possible worlds model \\(\\langle W, \\mathcal{I}\n\\rangle\\) consisting of a set of possible worlds \\(W\\) and an\ninterpretation function, \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) assigning a set of sets of\npossible worlds to the sentential operator: \nWhen we let the propositional quantifier range over sets of worlds in\n\\(W\\), we find that Kaplan’s sentence can only be satisfied in\nsuch a model if there is a map from the set of sets of worlds in \\(W\\)\ninto \\(W\\), which is not possible on account of Cantor’s\ntheorem. Kaplan thought this is a problem because the model theory for\nquantified propositional model should not unduly constrain the space\nof intuitive possibilities. \nIf we interpret \\(Qp\\) to mean that \\(p\\) is Queried, i.e., it is\nasked whether it is the case that \\(p\\), then (A) merely states that\nfor every proposition, \\(p\\), it is possible that \\(p\\) and only \\(p\\)\nis Queried. \nThe two results are not unrelated. Prior’s theorem provides a\nwitness to the claim that some propositions cannot be Queried\nuniquely. If the proposition expressed by the condition \\(\\forall\np(Qp\\rightarrow \\neg p)\\) is the only proposition that is Queried,\nthen it is true if and only if it is false. So, it can only be Queried\nif it is false. But it is false only if something true is\n Queried.[15] \nPropositional quantification made an early appearance in Lewis,\nLangford, & Lamprecht 1932, which is commonly acknowledged to have\npioneered the study of modal logic. They outlined a formal system of\nmodal logic with propositional quantification, which they used to\nformulate an Existence Postulate designed to guarantee the\nexistence of at least two propositions that are consistent and\nindependent from each other. (This is postulate B9 in the entry on the\n modern origins of modal logic.)\n They used the postulate to make sure strict implication did not\ncollapse into material\n implication.[16] \nKripke (1959), Fine (1970), and Kaplan (1970) went on to consider\nsystems of propositional modal logic supplemented with propositional\nquantifiers governed by appropriate axioms and rules of inference.\nMoreover, they explained how to generalize the Kripkean model theory\nfor propositional modal logic in order to accommodate the presence of\npropositional quantification. A Kripke model for the language of\npropositional modal logic is an ordered triple, \\(\\langle W, R,\n\\mathcal{I} \\rangle\\), in which \\(W\\) is a non-empty set of worlds,\n\\(R\\) is a binary relation on \\(W\\), and \\(\\mathcal{I}\\) is an\ninterpretation function, which can be taken to assign a set of\npossible worlds to each sentence letter in the language. This suggests\nwe interpret propositional quantification in terms of quantification\nover sets of worlds in \\(W\\). An assignment of values to the\npropositional variables \\(s\\) will map each propositional variable\ninto a set of worlds, and we define satisfaction at a world by an\nassignment \\(s\\) as usual, except for an appropriate clause for the\nquantifier: \\(\\forall p \\ A\\) is satisfied at a world \\(w\\) in \\(W\\)\nin \\(\\langle W, R, \\mathcal{I} \\rangle\\) by assignment \\(s\\) if, and\nonly if, \\(A\\) is satisfied at \\(w\\) by every assignment \\(s[p/S]\\) in\nwhich \\(S\\) is a subset of \\(W\\). The definitions of truth at a world\nand truth in a Kripke model then proceed as usual. \nThe axioms for propositional quantification are sound with respect to\nthe class of extended Kripke models for quantified propositional modal\nlogic. Unfortunately, they are not complete with respect to the same\nclass, since they do not allow us to derive the following as a\ntheorem: \nHowever, this formula is valid in every extended Kripke model for the\nsimple reason that its truth at a world in a model only requires the\nexistence of a maximally specific proposition, one which is true at\nexactly one world. \nThe question fits what should by now be a familiar pattern. Should\npropositional quantification be taken at face value? Or should it be\nassimilated to objectual quantification over propositions or maybe\nsubstitutional quantification over sentences? One may be tempted by\nthe first option by reflecting on what we did above. We expanded the\nlanguage of propositional modal logic with a new style of\nquantification, but the model theory explained the truth conditions\nassociated with the propositional quantifier, \\(\\forall p \\ A\\), in\nterms of objectual quantification over sets of worlds in the model.\nBut this is not to commit to the claim that propositional\nquantification is to be reduced to objectual quantification over sets\nof propositions or sets of possible worlds or what have you. The\nquestion of how to develop an appropriate model theory for the\nlanguage of quantified propositional logic is no substitute for the\nmore substantive question of whether there is an intelligible\ninterpretation of propositional quantification on which it is not\nconstrued as objectual quantification over propositions or\nsubstitutional quantification over sentences. \nWhile Prior (1971) and Grover (1972), for example, take propositional\nquantification to be importantly different from objectual and\nsubstitutional quantification, Richard (1996) suggests that\npropositional quantification should at the end of the day be treated\nas a species of objectual quantification, e.g., objectual\nquantification over propositions. \nMuch of contemporary ontology builds on the assumption that existence\nis to be understood in terms of quantification: in a slogan, to exist\nis to be something. Ontology is largely concerned with the domain of\nthe existential quantifier. This assumption can be traced\nback to the work of Frege and Russell, both of whom analyzed\nquantification in terms of predication, and plays a crucial role in\nQuine’s admonition to transform ontology into the study of the\nontological commitments of our global theory of the world regimented\nin the language of quantificational logic and identity. \nBy the link between quantification and existence, we mean the claim\nthat to exist is to be identical to something. This view can be traced\nback to Frege and Russell, who offered roughly the same broad analysis\nof quantification in terms of predication. The entry on\n existence\n provides a helpful overview and discussion of their account of\nexistence against the background of the historical context in which\nthey produced it. In what follows, we highlight a distinction between\nthe Frege-Russell analysis of quantification in terms of predication,\non the one hand, and the link between quantification and existence, on\nthe other. \nFrege (1980a, 1980b) explicitly analyzed quantification in terms of\npredication. For Frege, first-level predicates express concepts under\nwhich objects fall. A quantifier expresses a second-level concept\nunder which first-level concepts fall. In particular, he proposed to\ntake a sentence like (3) below to predicate of a first-level concept\nthat it has instances: \nThe existential quantifier, \\(\\exists\\), is, for Frege, a second-level\npredicate, which expresses a second-level concept under which a\nfirst-level concept such as square root of 4 falls if and\nonly if it has some instances. Likewise, the universal quantifier,\n\\(\\forall\\), is a second-level predicate, which expresses a\nsecond-level concept under which a first-level concept such as\nself-identical falls if and only if it has all objects as\ninstances. \nRussell (1905) offered a similar account of quantification. On\nRussell’s analysis, the proposition expressed by (5) predicates\nof a certain propositional function that it maps every object whatever\ninto a true proposition. (The entry on\n propositional functions\n provides more detail on the role of propositional functions in the\nearly development of modern logic.) \nThe propositional function \\(x\\) is self-identical maps the\nMoon to the true proposition that the Moon is self-identical, it maps\nthe Sun to the true proposition that the Sun is self-identical, etc.\nThe thrust of (5) is the proposition that no matter what object we\nsupply as argument, the propositional function \\(x\\) is\nself-identical will map it into a true proposition. The only\nsalient difference between Frege and Russell’s account of\nquantification lies in the choice of concepts and propositional\nfunctions, respectively, as the objects of predication; while Frege\ntakes each quantifier to correspond broadly to a second-level concept,\nRussell analyzes them in terms of certain properties of propositional\nfunctions. \nBoth Frege and Russell combine their account of quantification in\nterms of predication with the substantive thesis that existence is to\nbe understood in terms of quantification. For Frege, existence is to\nbe identified with the second-level concept expressed by the\nsecond-level predicate expressed by \\(\\exists\\). For Russell,\nexistence is identified with a certain property of propositional\nfunctions, e.g., being sometimes true. This may seem overkill; if\ntrue, it might seem that only first-level concepts exist, not the\nobjects they instantiate. For only first-level concepts are instances\nof the second-level concept expressed by\n \\(\\exists\\).[17]\n Instead, they are mostly concerned with the thesis that statements of\nexistence such as (7) are not cases in which a primitive\nproperty of existence is predicated of an object, but rather should be\nunderstood as an implicitly quantified statement such as (8), which is\nto be analyzed in terms of predication in (9) and (10) for Frege and\nRussell, respectively: \nThis point is perfectly compatible with the existence of a first-level\nconcept under which all and only those objects that exist fall. Take,\nfor example, the concept being self-identical. Likewise for\nRussell. The propositional function \\(x\\) is self-identical\nwill map all objects that exist into a true proposition. \nNote, however, that one could in principle retain their analysis and\ndeny, for example, that first-level concepts and propositional\nfunctions, respectively, can only be saturated by objects that exist.\nOne could take the view that some great philosophers who once existed,\nno longer exist. Socrates, for example, was a great philosopher who no\nlonger exists. He can nevertheless instantiate the first-level concept\nadmired by many philosophers. Or consider the bookcase I\nwould have built, had I finally assembled all the materials I\npurchased according to the assembly instructions that came with them.\nI have had concrete plans to build the bookcase for ages now; never\nmind the fact that I may never find the skill, time or energy to\nassemble it. My planned bookcase does not exist yet, and knowing\nmyself, it might well never exist. But one might take the view that we\ncan refer to it and that it instantiates many first-level concepts\nsuch as being a planned bookcase. On a view like this, the\nassertion that there are planned bookcases that do not exist would\nremain true even if none of its instances exist. \nA view like this would be classified as a form of Meinongianism by\nNelson (2012), and it would be subject to some of the difficulties\nother forms of Meinongianism face. Suffice it to say, for present\npurposes, that it would, however, require a radical departure from a\nvery influential approach to ontology advocated by Quine and endorsed\nby philosophers like Peter van Inwagen and David Lewis and their\nfollowers. \nQuine (1948) explicitly characterizes ontology as an attempt to answer\nthe question “what is there?” As he observed, the question\nmay seem deceptively simple, since it may be answered in a word:\n“everything”. The problem with this answer is that it is\nlargely uninformative. All parties agree that everything is something,\nbut there is still plenty of room of disagreement as to what kinds of\nobjects are there. Are there mereologically composite objects? Are\nthere concrete possible worlds? Are there mathematical objects? If\nthere are such objects, then they will of course lie in the domain of\nthe quantifier “everything”. However, philosophers are\nstill intensely divided as to whether they do. \nQuine’s strategy for the regimentation and resolution of\nontological disputes has informed much of contemporary ontology. He\nadvised philosophers to look at the ontological commitments incurred\nby our best global theory of the word—best by ordinary\nscientific standards or principled extensions thereof—when\nappropriately regimented in the language of pure quantificational\nlogic with\n identity.[18]\n One may perhaps think of the ontological commitments of our best\nglobal theory of the world as the demands that the truth of our total\ntheory imposes on the world. For example, we are committed to the\nexistence of objects of kind \\(K\\) if a proper regimentation of our\nbest global theory includes—or entails—a sentence of the\nform \\(\\exists x \\ Fx\\), where \\(F\\) is a predicate under which only\nobjects of kind \\(K\\) fall. Quine’s advice comes accompanied\nwith a criterion of ontological commitment whereby an appropriately\nregimented body of doctrine is ontologically committed to objects of\nkind \\(K\\) just in case objects of kind \\(K\\) must lie in the\nrange of our bound variables for the sentences of our theory to be\ntrue. More details are given in section 5 of the entry on\n Quine. \nAs Cartwright (1954) observed, it is far from clear how one is\nsupposed to interpret the modality in Quine’s official\nformulation of the criterion. A purely extensional version of the\ncriterion is plainly inadequate: \\(T\\) is ontologically committed to\nobjects of kind \\(K\\) if, and only if, \\(T\\) is true only if\nthe variables range over objects of kind \\(K\\). But the material\nconditional is much too weak for Quine’s purposes as it makes\nany false theory to be ontologically committed to all kinds of\n objects.[19]\n Quine’s general hostility to non-extensional notions makes the\nproblem all the more delicate for him. \nUnder Quine’s approach to ontology, an argument for the\nexistence of objects of kind \\(K\\)—whether mereologically\ncomplex objects, or concrete possible worlds, or mathematical\nobjects—takes the form of an argument for the thesis that\nquantification over such objects is indispensable to our best global\ntheory of the world. One of the most familiar instances of such\narguments is the Quine-Putnam argument for the existence of\nmathematical objects. Since mathematical objects are indispensable for\nscientific purposes, we should expect the quantifiers of our best\nglobal theory of the world to range over them. But once we settle the\nquestion of whether the quantifiers of our best global theory of the\nworld range over mathematical objects, we have settled the ontological\nquestion of whether such objects exist. The entry on\n indispensability arguments in mathematics\n includes extensive discussion of this and related indispensability\narguments in mathematics. Similar arguments have been deployed outside\nmathematics to argue for the existence of possible worlds,\nmereologically complex objects, and the like. \nThis brings us to a family of applications for different styles of\nquantification explored above. It is not uncommon to respond to\nindispensability arguments for the existence of objects of a certain\nkind by means of a paraphrase strategy, which if successful, would\nshow how to make do without the ontological commitment to objects of\nthe offending kind. Oftentimes, the paraphrase will involve a\ndifferent style of quantification, whether an alternative to classical\nquantification or an extension thereof. For example, Gottlieb (1980)\nattempted to respond to the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for\nthe existence of numbers by dispensing with objectual quantification\nin favor of substitutional quantification in arithmetic. Burgess &\nRosen (1997) provides an extensive catalogue of different expressive\nresources philosophers have used in order to bypass apparent\ncommitment to mathematical objects. Or take the question, for example,\nwhether there are composite objects of various kinds. Dorr & Rosen\n(2002), Hossack (2000); and van Inwagen (1995) have each argued that\nplural quantification can be used to paraphrase away apparent\nontological commitment to composite objects—other than organisms\nin van Inwagen’s case: we need only replace apparent singular\nquantification over composite objects with plural quantification over\nits alleged parts, and replace apparent singular predications of a\ncomposite object with plural predications of their\n parts.[20] \nWhen Quine answers “everything” to the fundamental\nontological question of what there is, he presumably intends the\nquantifier to range unrestrictedly over all objects at once. This\nobservation applies to ontological inquiry more generally. When a\nnominalist asserts that there are no mathematical objects, she does\nnot intend the thesis to be qualified by a restriction to a domain of\nconcrete objects; otherwise, the thesis would be devoid of interest.\nBut unrestricted quantification is not a very common phenomenon\noutside highly theoretical contexts such as logic and ontology. Take a\ntypical use of a quantifier expression in English as exemplified in a\ntypical utterance of the sentence: \nIn a typical context, the use of the quantifier\n“everything” is tacitly restricted to a domain of\ncontextually salient objects. In particular, it would be inappropriate\nfor another participant in the conversation to point out that the Moon\nis not on sale. The Moon is not an exception to the statement made by\nmy utterance of (11) because the Moon does not lie in the domain of\nquantification associated to my use of the quantifier. \nBut the fact that unrestricted quantification is relatively uncommon\nis no reason to doubt it is attainable in certain contexts.\nUnfortunately, many philosophers have recently doubted that genuinely\nunrestricted quantification is even coherent, much less\n attainable.[21]\n Note that these philosophers face at least two preliminary\nchallenges, both of which are forcefully pressed by Williamson (2003).\nFirst, they face the question of what to make of the prospects of\nontological inquiry without unrestricted generality. How should we\nformulate substantive ontological positions such as nominalism, if we\ncannot hope to quantify over all objects at once? The second challenge\nfor the skeptics is to state their own position. To the extent to\nwhich the thesis that we cannot quantify over everything appears to\nentail that there is something over which cannot quantify, skeptics\nseem to find themselves in a bind by inadvertently quantifying over\nwhat, by their own lights, lies beyond a legitimate domain of\n quantification.[22]\n Typical responses to each problem involve a surrogate for\nunrestricted generality in the form of either schematic generality or\nthe use of certain modal operators to simulate quantification over a\nseries of ever more comprehensive domains of\n quantification.[23] \nAt the core of the problem lies the assumption that the set-theoretic\nparadoxes cast doubt upon the existence of a comprehensive domain of\nall objects. What they reveal, according to Dummett (1991, 1993), is\nthe existence of indefinitely extensible concepts like set,\nordinal, and object. For Dummett, the indefinite\nextensibility of set is incompatible with the existence of a\ncomprehensive domain of all sets, since no matter what putative domain\nof all sets we isolate, we find that we can employ Russell’s\nreasoning to characterize further sets that lie beyond the putative\ndomain of all sets with which we began. The set of all\nnon-self-membered sets in the initial domain cannot, on pain of\ncontradiction, be in that domain, which means that it must lie in a\nmore comprehensive domain of all sets. If there is no domain of all\nsets, there is, the thought continues, no hope for a domain of all\nobjects. One may respond to this line of argument by contesting\nDummett’s diagnosis of the set-theoretic antinomies. Boolos\n(1993) suggests that we take Russell’s paradox, for example, to\nestablish that not every condition determines a set. The moral of\nRussell’s paradox is that there is no set of all\nnon-self-membered sets, not that it lies beyond the initial domain of\nquantification. \nFor another line of attack against the coherence of unrestricted\nquantification, one may ask what exactly is a domain of quantification\nsupposed to be. Skeptics often take a page from modern model theory\nand think of a domain of quantification as a set—or at least as\na set-like object, which contains as members all objects over which\nthe putatively unrestricted quantifier is supposed to range. They take\nfor granted that for a speaker to be able to quantify over some\nobjects, they must all be members of some set-like object, which\nconstitutes a domain of quantification. Cartwright (1994) called this\nthesis the All-in-One Principle. Now, if there is unrestricted\nquantification, then the domain of quantification associated to it\ncannot be a set-like object. For we could then deploy a suitable\nvariation on Russell’s paradox in order to obtain a\n contradiction.[24]\n Many have concluded from this that there is no genuinely unrestricted\nquantification over all objects at once. \nThe All-in-One principle is not beyond doubt. One application of\nplural quantification, which is explored by Cartwright (1994), is to\nabandon the All-in-One principle and to understand talk of a domain of\nquantification not as singular talk of collections but rather as\nplural talk of its members. To speak of a domain of certain objects is\njust to speak of the objects themselves—or to speak of a\nfirst-level concept under which they all fall; and to claim of a given\nobject that it lies in the domain is to claim of the object that it is\none of them. Alternatively, one may opt for the expressive resources\nof second-order quantification with the second-order quantifiers taken\nto range over Fregean concepts. Williamson (2003) outlines a\nconception of a domain of quantification as a Fregean concept under\nwhich certain objects may fall. To speak of a domain of all objects on\nthis view is to speak of a Fregean concept under which all\nobjects—without restriction—fall, and to claim of a given\nobject that it lies in the domain is merely to claim that the object\nfalls under the relevant Fregean concept. \nThe combination of quantification and modality traces back to Barcan\n(1946, 1947) and Carnap (1946). Historically, however, this\ncombination came under sustained attack by Quine, who, like Carnap,\nassumed that \\(\\Box\\) could only interpreted in terms of logical\nnecessity or analyticity. As Carnap himself recognized, the linguistic\nconception of necessity raises the question of how to assign\nintelligible truth conditions to de re modal generalizations\nof the form \\(\\exists x \\ \\Box\n Px\\).[25]\n For the truth conditions for such a sentence appear to require one to\nmake sense of the truth of an open formula of the form \\(\\Box Px\\)\nwith respect to an assignment of a value to the variable \\(x\\). If we\nread \\(\\Box\\) to mean: “it is analytic that”, then one may\nwonder what sense could be made of the claim that an open formula\n\\(Px\\) is analytic with respect to an assignment of an object to\n\\(x\\). Quine had anticipated the issue in Quine (1943), and he pressed\nthe criticism again in Quine (1953, 1960). Quine’s objections\nare commonly taken not to apply to other interpretations of \\(\\Box\\)\nin terms of metaphysical necessity as discussed, for example, in\nKripke (1980). When we move past Quine’s criticisms and combine\npure quantificational logic with propositional modal logic, we obtain\nquantified modal logic. \nThe interaction of quantification and modality turns out to raise\ndifficult philosophical problems. As we will see, some of these\ndifficulties have, in fact, inclined some philosophers to rethink the\nscope of pure quantificational logic. The problem is that certain\ntheorems of quantified modal logic suggest that everything is\nnecessarily something. The subject matter of ontology is necessary:\nnothing could have failed to be something. \nQuantified modal logic is the system that combines pure\nquantificational logic with propositional modal logic. Propositional\nmodal logic investigates the logic of the modal operators \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) and is discussed in the entry on\n modal logic.\n The language of propositional modal logic supplements the language of\npropositional logic with the sentential operator \\(\\Box\\), and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) may then be explicitly defined as \\(\\neg \\Box \\neg\\). A\nweak propositional modal logic called K logic includes as axioms all\ntautologies and all instances of schema K: \nThe rules of inference of the system include modus ponens and\nwhat is often known as a rule of necessitation: \nThe combination of propositional modal logic and pure quantificational\nlogic is often called quantified modal logic and is discussed in\nsection 13 of the entry on\n modal logic\n and the entry on\n actualism.\n This combination immediately delivers what we may call the\nnecessity of being: \nThe key to this observation is that the open formula \\(\\exists y \\ x =\ny\\) is a theorem of pure quantificational logic. Successive\napplications of the rule of necessitation and universal generalization\nare all it takes to complete the proof. \nOn the alethic interpretation of \\(\\Box\\) in terms of metaphysical\nnecessity, this theorem reads as the claim that everything is\nnecessarily something. Take the Griffith Observatory, for example. It\nis a consequence of the theorem that it is necessarily something. The\nGriffith Observatory would have been something even if no funds had\nbeen available for construction and nothing had ever been built in the\nsite it occupies. And what is true of the Griffith Observatory is true\nof us: each of us is necessarily something. When we combine this\nresult with the link between quantification and existence, we conclude\nthat everything exists necessarily, which flies in the face of the\nassumption that we exist only contingently. \nWith the help of schema K, one may prove the Converse Barcan\nFormula: \nOn the alethic interpretation of the modality, this states that if\nnecessarily, everything is \\(A\\), everything is necessarily \\(A\\). The\nproof is given, for example, in one of the supplements to the entry on\n actualism.\n But this provides another route to the necessity of being: since\nnecessarily, everything is something, everything is necessarily\nsomething. In the presence of a further plausible modal principle, B,\nwe may even prove the Barcan Formula. The Brouwerian principle, B,\nstates that whatever is the case is necessarily, possibly the\ncase: \nThe Barcan Formula states that if everything is necessarily \\(A\\),\nthen necessarily, everything is \\(A\\): \nOr, equivalently: \nThe entry on\n actualism\n includes a proof of BF. But this formula is deemed unacceptable by\nmany philosophers. Consider my plans to build a bookcase. Even if I\nnever manage to build one, it is certainly possible for me to build\none. So, it is possible for there to be some bookcase I have built. By\nthe Barcan Formula, it seems to follow that something is possibly a\nbookcase I build. The Barcan Formula does not settle whether or not\nthis object is in fact a concrete object, much less a bookcase one may\nin fact use to store one’s books. In fact, to deny this is one\nway to come to terms with the Barcan Formula. \nWhat is true of the combination of pure quantificational logic with\npropositional modal logic is mutatis mutandis true of the\ncombination of pure quantificational logic and propositional tense\nlogic. Certain theorems of quantified tense logic suggest that\neverything has always been, is, and will always be something. The\ndomain of ontology is immutable: nothing ever fails to be\nsomething. \nPropositional tense logic investigates the logic of tense operators\nlike \\(H\\), read: “it has always been the case that”,\n\\(P\\), read: “it was the case that”, \\(G\\), read:\n“it will always be the case that”, and \\(F\\), read:\n“it will be the case that”. In place of K, we have\ndistribution axioms: \nAnd in place of the rule of necessitation, we have rules of temporal\ngeneralization: \nMore details are provided in the entry on\n temporal logic. \nThe combination of propositional tense logic and pure quantificational\nlogic immediately delivers the eternality of being: \nwhich states that everything has has always been, is, and will always\nbe, something. The Griffith Observatory was something even before it\nwas built in 1935—and will always be something—even\nbillions of years from now. And what is true of the Griffith\nObservatory is true of us: each of us has always been, is, and will be\nsomething—even before our birth and long after our death. \nQuantified tense logic proves temporal versions of CBF: \nAnd, finally, we have two temporal versions of BF: \nIn order to appreciate the difficulty, we may take the contrapositive\nof the temporal version of BF for \\(H\\), where \\(P\\) is defined as\nusual, as: \\(\\neg H \\neg\\): \nWe infer, for example, that there were dinosaurs only if there are\npast dinosaurs. If to exist is to be something, then past dinosaurs\nexist. But whether this commits us to flesh-and-blood dinosaurs is of\ncourse a different matter, since being a past dinosaur need not\nrequire being a dinosaur. \nThe interaction between pure quantificational logic and tense and\nmodality suggests the domain of ontology is immutable and necessary.\nBut we can only draw these conclusions by making use of some auxiliary\nassumptions, some of which are far from obvious. The highly\ncounterintuitive character of the conclusions has consequently led\nmany philosophers to place some of the auxiliary assumptions under\nclose scrutiny. Other philosophers have followed argument where it\nleads, and they have sought to reconcile the eternal and necessary\ncharacter of the domain of ontology with the apparent temporary and\ncontingent character of existence. In fact, Williamson 2013 set out to\nprovide a separate battery of arguments for the necessity and\nimmutability of ontology. \nOne auxiliary assumption one may question is the traditional link\nbetween quantification and existence. Even if there is no change in\nthe domain of quantification, you may nevertheless think that\nexistence is only temporary. Socrates did not exist either before 490\nBCE or after 399 BCE, and the mere fact that he is, has and will\nalways be something is not reason to attribute existence to him. One\nvariant of this move is a direct descendant of Meinong’s view on\nexistence as a mere species of being. But to the extent to which\nMeinongianism may be accompanied with the implausible thesis that no\nmatter what condition we substitute for \\(F\\) in “the \\(F\\) is\n\\(F\\)” gives rise to a true sentence, it would seem to entail\nthat “the round square is a round square” is true, which\nseems hopeless. But the Meinongian thesis is not compulsory for more\nplausible developments of the view that not everything exists, even\nthough everything is\n something.[26]\n What is not negotiable, though, is the thesis that existence should\nnot be taken to be expressed by a quantificational expression, but\nrather by a predicate which may or not apply to objects in the domain.\nThe moral of the temporal versions of BF and CBF is only that\nunrestricted quantification ranges over an immutable and necessary\ndomain of objects, whether or not they enjoy temporary and contingent\nexistence. The difficult question remains of how to answer\nQuine’s question “what is there?” once one abandons\nthe thesis that no matter what condition \\(F\\) may be, there are\nobjects that satisfy the condition. For more on different variants of\nMeinongianism, the reader may consult the entry on\n existence. \nThere is, in the second place, the assumption that the axioms of pure\nquantificational logic remain true when we expand the language to\ninclude other sentential operators, whether temporal, modal or\n otherwise.[27]\n What is perhaps the most common response to our predicament is to\nrecoil from pure quantificational logic into a suitably weakened\nvariant of it. This is, for example, the path taken in Kripke (1963),\nwhere Kripke proposes to weaken the axiom of universal instantiation\nin line with the first version of inclusive quantificational logic\ndiscussed earlier. Since \\(\\exists y \\ x = y\\) is not a theorem of\ninclusive quantificational logic, we are not in a position to\nnecessitate, which blocks the derivation of the necessity of\n being.[28]\n Kripke’s quantified modal logic is discussed in the entry on\n actualism.\n Others have fallen back into alternative forms of free logic, but\nthere appears to be no consensus as to which one is the best\nalternative to pure quantificational logic. It may be helpful to note,\nhowever, that some of the relevant free logics merely restrict the\naxiom of universal instantiation by means of an existence predicate\nand do nothing to block the derivation of other allegedly problematic\nprinciples such as the necessity of identity, which is the thesis that\neverything is necessarily self-identical. Since, presumably, an object\ncan only be necessarily self-identical if it exists necessarily,\nopponents of CBF will also want to have some resources to block the\nnecessity of identity. \nThe derivability of the necessity of identity from the axioms of\nidentity and the rule of necessitation may perhaps invite one to\nconsider another option. Maybe the culprit is not pure\nquantificational logic, but rather the indiscriminate use of the rule\nof necessitation. The rationale for necessitation is that every\nprovable sentence should be necessarily true, but it is not clear how\nthis thought is supposed to generalize to open formulas, which,\nstrictly speaking, are not true or false. Open formulas are merely\ntrue or false under an assignment of values to their free variables.\nBut the fact that \\(x = x\\), for example, is true under an assignment\n\\(s\\) on which \\(x\\) is assigned a table is no reason to think that\n\\(x = x\\) is necessarily true under such an assignment if you think\nthat the table could have not been\n there.[29]\n One problem for this strategy is that it is of little help when we\nallow closed terms such as constant symbols into the language of\nquantified modal logic. In the presence of constant symbols, classical\nquantificational logic allows us to derive the sentence \\(\\exists x \\\na = x\\) as a theorem, whence, by necessitation for complete sentences,\nwe infer \\(\\Box \\exists x \\ a= x\\), which seems objectionable if \\(a\\)\nis suppose to regiment a name for an object that exists only\ncontingently. One could avoid the problems by barring closed terms\nfrom the language, but such a radical exclusion seems ad hoc\nand artificial. So, if one chooses to restrict necessitation, one must\nprovide a different rationale for it. Deutsch (1990) provides an\nexample of this strategy. \nThe fourth and final option to consider is to take the derivability of\nCBF in tense and modal logic at face value, and embrace the conclusion\nthat existence is indeed immutable and necessary. These are the theses\nthat Williamson (2013) calls “permanentism” and\n“necessitism”. The task for each approach is to explain\nour initial reluctance to embrace them in the first place. Take the\napparent resistance to accept the claim that Socrates will always be\nsomething despite the fact that he died in 399 BCE. The permanentist\nmay respond that if we are initially disinclined to accept this claim,\nit is only because we mistakenly think that because a person, for\nexample, is a concrete object, a past or a future person must be\nconcrete as well. Socrates, which is a past person, was not a person\neither before 490 BCE or after 399 BCE; indeed, Socrates is now not a\nperson, nor will he be one in the future. Likewise, a merely possible\nperson need not be a person either and neither the Barcan nor the\nConverse Barcan Formula threaten the temporary and contingent\ncharacter of concreteness. Since I could have found the time, skill\nand energy to build a bookcase, some object is possibly a bookcase\nbuilt by me. But the necessitist will be at pains to add that to be a\npossible bookcase built by me is not to be a bookcase built by me,\nmuch less a bookcase. This outlook is defended by Linsky & Zalta\n(1994) and Williamson (2013). But there are other points of contact.\nFor example, all versions of necessitism must reject unqualified\n“essentialist” theses such as the view that a person is\nnecessarily a person; at most, one can perhaps maintain the weaker\nthesis that a person is necessarily if concrete, a person. Likewise,\nall versions of necessitism seem committed to the actual existence of\nmany more nonsets than can form a set. Sider (2009), for example,\nargues that necessitism is committed to the actual existence of at\nleast \\(\\kappa\\) nonsets for each set-theoretic cardinal \\(\\kappa\\).\nAnd Hawthorne & Uzquiano (2011) raises other cardinality problems\nfor a combination of necessitism with certain common mereological\nassumptions.","contact.mail":"uzquiano@usc.edu","contact.domain":"usc.edu"}]
